For twenty years I had been perfectly comfortable; for\ntwenty years I had had the window-boxes filled in the spring, the\ncarpets lifted, the awnings put up and the furniture covered with brown\nlinen; for as many summers I had said good-by to my friends, and, after\nwatching their perspiring hegira, had settled down to a delicious quiet\nin town, where the mail comes three times a day, and the water supply\ndoes not depend on a tank on the roof.\n\nAnd then--the madness seized me.  When I look back over the months I\nspent at Sunnyside, I wonder that I survived at all.  As it is, I show\nthe wear and tear of my harrowing experiences.  I have turned very\ngray--Liddy reminded me of it, only yesterday, by saying that a little\nbluing in the rinse-water would make my hair silvery, instead of a\nyellowish white.  I hate to be reminded of unpleasant things and I\nsnapped her off.\n\n\"No,\" I said sharply, \"I'm not going to use bluing at my time of life,\nor starch, either.\"\n\nLiddy's nerves are gone, she says, since that awful summer, but she has\nenough left, goodness knows!  And when she begins to go around with a\nlump in her throat, all I have to do is to threaten to return to\nSunnyside, and she is frightened into a semblance of\ncheerfulness,--from which you may judge that the summer there was\nanything but a success.\n\nThe newspaper accounts have been so garbled and incomplete--one of them\nmentioned me but once, and then only as the tenant at the time the\nthing happened--that I feel it my due to tell what I know.  Mr.\nJamieson, the detective, said himself he could never have done without\nme, although he gave me little enough credit, in print.\n\nI shall have to go back several years--thirteen, to be exact--to start\nmy story.  At that time my brother died, leaving me his two children.\nHalsey was eleven then, and Gertrude was seven.  All the\nresponsibilities of maternity were thrust upon me suddenly; to perfect\nthe profession of motherhood requires precisely as many years as the\nchild has lived, like the man who started to carry the calf and ended\nby walking along with the bull on his shoulders.  However, I did the\nbest I could.  When Gertrude got past the hair-ribbon age, and Halsey\nasked for a scarf-pin and put on long trousers--and a wonderful help\nthat was to the darning.--I sent them away to good schools.  After\nthat, my responsibility was chiefly postal, with three months every\nsummer in which to replenish their wardrobes, look over their lists of\nacquaintances, and generally to take my foster-motherhood out of its\nnine months' retirement in camphor.\n\nI missed the summers with them when, somewhat later, at boarding-school\nand college, the children spent much of their vacations with friends.\nGradually I found that my name signed to a check was even more welcome\nthan when signed to a letter, though I wrote them at stated intervals.\nBut when Halsey had finished his electrical course and Gertrude her\nboarding-school, and both came home to stay, things were suddenly\nchanged.  The winter Gertrude came out was nothing but a succession of\nsitting up late at night to bring her home from things, taking her to\nthe dressmakers between naps the next day, and discouraging ineligible\nyouths with either more money than brains, or more brains than money.\nAlso, I acquired a great many things: to say lingerie for\nunder-garments, \"frocks\" and \"gowns\" instead of dresses, and that\nbeardless sophomores are not college boys, but college men.  Halsey\nrequired less personal supervision, and as they both got their mother's\nfortune that winter, my responsibility became purely moral.  Halsey\nbought a car, of course, and I learned how to tie over my bonnet a gray\nbaize veil, and, after a time, never to stop to look at the dogs one\nhas run down.  People are apt to be so unpleasant about their dogs.\n\nThe additions to my education made me a properly equipped maiden aunt,\nand by spring I was quite tractable.  So when Halsey suggested camping\nin the Adirondacks and Gertrude wanted Bar Harbor, we compromised on a\ngood country house with links near, within motor distance of town and\ntelephone distance of the doctor.  That was how we went to Sunnyside.\n\nWe went out to inspect the property, and it seemed to deserve its name.\nIts cheerful appearance gave no indication whatever of anything out of\nthe ordinary.  Only one thing seemed unusual to me: the housekeeper,\nwho had been left in charge, had moved from the house to the gardener's\nlodge, a few days before.  As the lodge was far enough away from the\nhouse, it seemed to me that either fire or thieves could complete their\nwork of destruction undisturbed.  The property was an extensive one:\nthe house on the top of a hill, which sloped away in great stretches of\ngreen lawn and clipped hedges, to the road; and across the valley,\nperhaps a couple of miles away, was the Greenwood Club House.  Gertrude\nand Halsey were infatuated.\n\n\"Why, it's everything you want,\" Halsey said \"View, air, good water and\ngood roads.  As for the house, it's big enough for a hospital, if it\nhas a Queen Anne front and a Mary Anne back,\" which was ridiculous: it\nwas pure Elizabethan.\n\nOf course we took the place; it was not my idea of comfort, being much\ntoo large and sufficiently isolated to make the servant question\nserious.  But I give myself credit for this: whatever has happened\nsince, I never blamed Halsey and Gertrude for taking me there.  And\nanother thing: if the series of catastrophes there did nothing else, it\ntaught me one thing--that somehow, somewhere, from perhaps a\nhalf-civilized ancestor who wore a sheepskin garment and trailed his\nfood or his prey, I have in me the instinct of the chase.  Were I a man\nI should be a trapper of criminals, trailing them as relentlessly as no\ndoubt my sheepskin ancestor did his wild boar.  But being an unmarried\nwoman, with the handicap of my sex, my first acquaintance with crime\nwill probably be my last.  Indeed, it came near enough to being my last\nacquaintance with anything.\n\nThe property was owned by Paul Armstrong, the president of the Traders'\nBank, who at the time we took the house was in the west with his wife\nand daughter, and a Doctor Walker, the Armstrong family physician.\nHalsey knew Louise Armstrong,--had been rather attentive to her the\nwinter before, but as Halsey was always attentive to somebody, I had\nnot thought of it seriously, although she was a charming girl.  I knew\nof Mr. Armstrong only through his connection with the bank, where the\nchildren's money was largely invested, and through an ugly story about\nthe son, Arnold Armstrong, who was reported to have forged his father's\nname, for a considerable amount, to some bank paper.  However, the\nstory had had no interest for me.\n\nI cleared Halsey and Gertrude away to a house party, and moved out to\nSunnyside the first of May.  The roads were bad, but the trees were in\nleaf, and there were still tulips in the borders around the house.  The\narbutus was fragrant in the woods under the dead leaves, and on the way\nfrom the station, a short mile, while the car stuck in the mud, I found\na bank showered with tiny forget-me-nots.  The birds--don't ask me what\nkind; they all look alike to me, unless they have a hall mark of some\nbright color--the birds were chirping in the hedges, and everything\nbreathed of peace.  Liddy, who was born and bred on a brick pavement,\ngot a little bit down-spirited when the crickets began to chirp, or\nscrape their legs together, or whatever it is they do, at twilight.\n\nThe first night passed quietly enough.  I have always been grateful for\nthat one night's peace; it shows what the country might be, under\nfavorable circumstances.  Never after that night did I put my head on\nmy pillow with any assurance how long it would be there; or on my\nshoulders, for that matter.\n\nOn the following morning Liddy and Mrs. Ralston, my own housekeeper,\nhad a difference of opinion, and Mrs. Ralston left on the eleven train.\nJust after luncheon, Burke, the butler, was taken unexpectedly with a\npain in his right side, much worse when I was within hearing distance,\nand by afternoon he was started cityward.  That night the cook's sister\nhad a baby--the cook, seeing indecision in my face, made it twins on\nsecond thought--and, to be short, by noon the next day the household\nstaff was down to Liddy and myself.  And this in a house with\ntwenty-two rooms and five baths!\n\nLiddy wanted to go back to the city at once, but the milk-boy said that\nThomas Johnson, the Armstrongs' colored butler, was working as a waiter\nat the Greenwood Club, and might come back. I have the usual scruples\nabout coercing people's servants away, but few of us have any\nconscience regarding institutions or corporations--witness the way we\nbeat railroads and street-car companies when we can--so I called up the\nclub, and about eight o'clock Thomas Johnson came to see me.  Poor\nThomas!\n\nWell, it ended by my engaging Thomas on the spot, at outrageous wages,\nand with permission to sleep in the gardener's lodge, empty since the\nhouse was rented.  The old man--he was white-haired and a little\nstooped, but with an immense idea of his personal dignity--gave me his\nreasons hesitatingly.\n\n\"I ain't sayin' nothin', Mis' Innes,\" he said, with his hand on the\ndoor-knob, \"but there's been goin's-on here this las' few months as\nain't natchal.  'Tain't one thing an' 'tain't another--it's jest a door\nsquealin' here, an' a winder closin' there, but when doors an' winders\ngets to cuttin' up capers and there's nobody nigh 'em, it's time Thomas\nJohnson sleeps somewhar's else.\"\n\nLiddy, who seemed to be never more than ten feet away from me that\nnight, and was afraid of her shadow in that great barn of a place,\nscreamed a little, and turned a yellow-green.  But I am not easily\nalarmed.\n\nIt was entirely in vain; I represented to Thomas that we were alone,\nand that he would have to stay in the house that night. He was politely\nfirm, but he would come over early the next morning, and if I gave him\na key, he would come in time to get some sort of breakfast.  I stood on\nthe huge veranda and watched him shuffle along down the shadowy drive,\nwith mingled feelings--irritation at his cowardice and thankfulness at\ngetting him at all.  I am not ashamed to say that I double-locked the\nhall door when I went in.\n\n\"You can lock up the rest of the house and go to bed, Liddy,\" I said\nseverely.  \"You give me the creeps standing there.  A woman of your age\nought to have better sense.\"  It usually braces Liddy to mention her\nage: she owns to forty--which is absurd.  Her mother cooked for my\ngrandfather, and Liddy must be at least as old as I.  But that night\nshe refused to brace.\n\n\"You're not going to ask me to lock up, Miss Rachel!\" she quavered.\n\"Why, there's a dozen French windows in the drawing-room and the\nbilliard-room wing, and every one opens on a porch. And Mary Anne said\nthat last night there was a man standing by the stable when she locked\nthe kitchen door.\"\n\n\"Mary Anne was a fool,\" I said sternly.  \"If there had been a man\nthere, she would have had him in the kitchen and been feeding him what\nwas left from dinner, inside of an hour, from force of habit.  Now\ndon't be ridiculous.  Lock up the house and go to bed.  I am going to\nread.\"\n\nBut Liddy set her lips tight and stood still.\n\n\"I'm not going to bed,\" she said.  \"I am going to pack up, and\nto-morrow I am going to leave.\"\n\n\"You'll do nothing of the sort,\" I snapped.  Liddy and I often desire\nto part company, but never at the same time.  \"If you are afraid, I\nwill go with you, but for goodness' sake don't try to hide behind me.\"\n\nThe house was a typical summer residence on an extensive scale.\nWherever possible, on the first floor, the architect had done away with\npartitions, using arches and columns instead.  The effect was cool and\nspacious, but scarcely cozy.  As Liddy and I went from one window to\nanother, our voices echoed back at us uncomfortably.  There was plenty\nof light--the electric plant down in the village supplied us--but there\nwere long vistas of polished floor, and mirrors which reflected us from\nunexpected corners, until I felt some of Liddy's foolishness\ncommunicate itself to me.\n\nThe house was very long, a rectangle in general form, with the main\nentrance in the center of the long side.  The brick-paved entry opened\ninto a short hall to the right of which, separated only by a row of\npillars, was a huge living-room.  Beyond that was the drawing-room, and\nin the end, the billiard-room.  Off the billiard-room, in the extreme\nright wing, was a den, or card-room, with a small hall opening on the\neast veranda, and from there went up a narrow circular staircase.\nHalsey had pointed it out with delight.\n\n\"Just look, Aunt Rachel,\" he said with a flourish.  \"The architect that\nput up this joint was wise to a few things. Arnold Armstrong and his\nfriends could sit here and play cards all night and stumble up to bed\nin the early morning, without having the family send in a police call.\"\n\nLiddy and I got as far as the card-room and turned on all the lights.\nI tried the small entry door there, which opened on the veranda, and\nexamined the windows.  Everything was secure, and Liddy, a little less\nnervous now, had just pointed out to me the disgracefully dusty\ncondition of the hard-wood floor, when suddenly the lights went out.\nWe waited a moment; I think Liddy was stunned with fright, or she would\nhave screamed.  And then I clutched her by the arm and pointed to one\nof the windows opening on the porch.  The sudden change threw the\nwindow into relief, an oblong of grayish light, and showed us a figure\nstanding close, peering in.  As I looked it darted across the veranda\nand out of sight in the darkness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nA LINK CUFF-BUTTON\n\nLiddy's knees seemed to give away under her.  Without a sound she sank\ndown, leaving me staring at the window in petrified amazement.  Liddy\nbegan to moan under her breath, and in my excitement I reached down and\nshook her.\n\n\"Stop it,\" I whispered.  \"It's only a woman--maybe a maid of the\nArmstrongs'.  Get up and help me find the door.\"  She groaned again.\n\"Very well,\" I said, \"then I'll have to leave you here. I'm going.\"\n\nShe moved at that, and, holding to my sleeve, we felt our way, with\nnumerous collisions, to the billiard-room, and from there to the\ndrawing-room.  The lights came on then, and, with the long French\nwindows unshuttered, I had a creepy feeling that each one sheltered a\npeering face.  In fact, in the light of what happened afterward, I am\npretty certain we were under surveillance during the entire ghostly\nevening.  We hurried over the rest of the locking-up and got upstairs\nas quickly as we could.  I left the lights all on, and our footsteps\nechoed cavernously.  Liddy had a stiff neck the next morning, from\nlooking back over her shoulder, and she refused to go to bed.\n\n\"Let me stay in your dressing-room, Miss Rachel,\" she begged. \"If you\ndon't, I'll sit in the hall outside the door.  I'm not going to be\nmurdered with my eyes shut.\"\n\n\"If you're going to be murdered,\" I retorted, \"it won't make any\ndifference whether they are shut or open.  But you may stay in the\ndressing-room, if you will lie on the couch: when you sleep in a chair\nyou snore.\"\n\nShe was too far gone to be indignant, but after a while she came to the\ndoor and looked in to where I was composing myself for sleep with\nDrummond's Spiritual Life.\n\n\"That wasn't a woman, Miss Rachel,\" she said, with her shoes in her\nhand.  \"It was a man in a long coat.\"\n\n\"What woman was a man?\"  I discouraged her without looking up, and she\nwent back to the couch.\n\nIt was eleven o'clock when I finally prepared for bed.  In spite of my\nassumption of indifference, I locked the door into the hall, and\nfinding the transom did not catch, I put a chair cautiously before the\ndoor--it was not necessary to rouse Liddy--and climbing up put on the\nledge of the transom a small dressing-mirror, so that any movement of\nthe frame would send it crashing down.  Then, secure in my precautions,\nI went to bed.\n\nI did not go to sleep at once.  Liddy disturbed me just as I was\ngrowing drowsy, by coming in and peering under the bed.  She was afraid\nto speak, however, because of her previous snubbing, and went back,\nstopping in the doorway to sigh dismally.\n\nSomewhere down-stairs a clock with a chime sang away the\nhours--eleven-thirty, forty-five, twelve.  And then the lights went out\nto stay.  The Casanova Electric Company shuts up shop and goes home to\nbed at midnight: when one has a party, I believe it is customary to fee\nthe company, which will drink hot coffee and keep awake a couple of\nhours longer.  But the lights were gone for good that night.  Liddy had\ngone to sleep, as I knew she would.  She was a very unreliable person:\nalways awake and ready to talk when she wasn't wanted and dozing off to\nsleep when she was.  I called her once or twice, the only result being\nan explosive snore that threatened her very windpipe--then I got up and\nlighted a bedroom candle.\n\nMy bedroom and dressing room were above the big living-room on the\nfirst floor.  On the second floor a long corridor ran the length of the\nhouse, with rooms opening from both sides.  In the wings were small\ncorridors crossing the main one--the plan was simplicity itself.  And\njust as I got back into bed, I heard a sound from the east wing,\napparently, that made me stop, frozen, with one bedroom slipper half\noff, and listen.  It was a rattling metallic sound, and it reverberated\nalong the empty halls like the crash of doom.  It was for all the world\nas if something heavy, perhaps a piece of steel, had rolled clattering\nand jangling down the hard-wood stairs leading to the card-room.\n\nIn the silence that followed Liddy stirred and snored again.  I was\nexasperated: first she kept me awake by silly alarms, then when she was\nneeded she slept like Joe Jefferson, or Rip,--they are always the same\nto me.  I went in and aroused her, and I give her credit for being wide\nawake the minute I spoke.\n\n\"Get up,\" I said, \"if you don't want to be murdered in your bed.\"\n\n\"Where?  How?\" she yelled vociferously, and jumped up.\n\n\"There's somebody in the house,\" I said.  \"Get up.  We'll have to get\nto the telephone.\"\n\n\"Not out in the hall!\" she gasped; \"Oh, Miss Rachel, not out in the\nhall!\" trying to hold me back.  But I am a large woman and Liddy is\nsmall.  We got to the door, somehow, and Liddy held a brass andiron,\nwhich it was all she could do to lift, let alone brain anybody with.  I\nlistened, and, hearing nothing, opened the door a little and peered\ninto the hall.  It was a black void, full of terrible suggestion, and\nmy candle only emphasized the gloom.  Liddy squealed and drew me back\nagain, and as the door slammed, the mirror I had put on the transom\ncame down and hit her on the head.  That completed our demoralization.\nIt was some time before I could persuade her she had not been attacked\nfrom behind by a burglar, and when she found the mirror smashed on the\nfloor she wasn't much better.\n\n\"There's going to be a death!\" she wailed.  \"Oh, Miss Rachel, there's\ngoing to be a death!\"\n\n\"There will be,\" I said grimly, \"if you don't keep quiet, Liddy Allen.\"\n\nAnd so we sat there until morning, wondering if the candle would last\nuntil dawn, and arranging what trains we could take back to town.  If\nwe had only stuck to that decision and gone back before it was too late!\n\nThe sun came finally, and from my window I watched the trees along the\ndrive take shadowy form, gradually lose their ghostlike appearance,\nbecome gray and then green.  The Greenwood Club showed itself a dab of\nwhite against the hill across the valley, and an early robin or two\nhopped around in the dew.  Not until the milk-boy and the sun came,\nabout the same time, did I dare to open the door into the hall and look\naround.  Everything was as we had left it.  Trunks were heaped here and\nthere, ready for the trunk-room, and through an end window of stained\nglass came a streak of red and yellow daylight that was eminently\ncheerful. The milk-boy was pounding somewhere below, and the day had\nbegun.\n\nThomas Johnson came ambling up the drive about half-past six, and we\ncould hear him clattering around on the lower floor, opening shutters.\nI had to take Liddy to her room up-stairs, however,--she was quite sure\nshe would find something uncanny. In fact, when she did not, having now\nthe courage of daylight, she was actually disappointed.\n\nWell, we did not go back to town that day.\n\nThe discovery of a small picture fallen from the wall of the\ndrawing-room was quite sufficient to satisfy Liddy that the alarm had\nbeen a false one, but I was anything but convinced.  Allowing for my\nnerves and the fact that small noises magnify themselves at night,\nthere was still no possibility that the picture had made the series of\nsounds I heard.  To prove it, however, I dropped it again.  It fell\nwith a single muffled crash of its wooden frame, and incidentally\nruined itself beyond repair.  I justified myself by reflecting that if\nthe Armstrongs chose to leave pictures in unsafe positions, and to rent\na house with a family ghost, the destruction of property was their\nresponsibility, not mine.\n\nI warned Liddy not to mention what had happened to anybody, and\ntelephoned to town for servants.  Then after a breakfast which did more\ncredit to Thomas' heart than his head, I went on a short tour of\ninvestigation.  The sounds had come from the east wing, and not without\nsome qualms I began there.  At first I found nothing.  Since then I\nhave developed my powers of observation, but at that time I was a\nnovice.  The small card-room seemed undisturbed.  I looked for\nfootprints, which is, I believe, the conventional thing to do, although\nmy experience has been that as clues both footprints and thumb-marks\nare more useful in fiction than in fact.  But the stairs in that wing\noffered something.\n\nAt the top of the flight had been placed a tall wicker hamper, packed,\nwith linen that had come from town.  It stood at the edge of the top\nstep, almost barring passage, and on the step below it was a long fresh\nscratch.  For three steps the scratch was repeated, gradually\ndiminishing, as if some object had fallen, striking each one.  Then for\nfour steps nothing.  On the fifth step below was a round dent in the\nhard wood.  That was all, and it seemed little enough, except that I\nwas positive the marks had not been there the day before.\n\nIt bore out my theory of the sound, which had been for all the world\nlike the bumping of a metallic object down a flight of steps.  The four\nsteps had been skipped.  I reasoned that an iron bar, for instance,\nwould do something of the sort,--strike two or three steps, end down,\nthen turn over, jumping a few stairs, and landing with a thud.\n\nIron bars, however, do not fall down-stairs in the middle of the night\nalone.  Coupled with the figure on the veranda the agency by which it\nclimbed might be assumed.  But--and here was the thing that puzzled me\nmost--the doors were all fastened that morning, the windows unmolested,\nand the particular door from the card-room to the veranda had a\ncombination lock of which I held the key, and which had not been\ntampered with.\n\nI fixed on an attempt at burglary, as the most natural explanation--an\nattempt frustrated by the falling of the object, whatever it was, that\nhad roused me.  Two things I could not understand: how the intruder had\nescaped with everything locked, and why he had left the small silver,\nwhich, in the absence of a butler, had remained down-stairs over night.\n\nUnder pretext of learning more about the place, Thomas Johnson led me\nthrough the house and the cellars, without result. Everything was in\ngood order and repair; money had been spent lavishly on construction\nand plumbing.  The house was full of conveniences, and I had no reason\nto repent my bargain, save the fact that, in the nature of things,\nnight must come again. And other nights must follow--and we were a long\nway from a police-station.\n\nIn the afternoon a hack came up from Casanova, with a fresh relay of\nservants.  The driver took them with a flourish to the servants'\nentrance, and drove around to the front of the house, where I was\nawaiting him.\n\n\"Two dollars,\" he said in reply to my question.  \"I don't charge full\nrates, because, bringin' 'em up all summer as I do, it pays to make a\nspecial price.  When they got off the train, I sez, sez I, 'There's\nanother bunch for Sunnyside, cook, parlor maid and all.'  Yes'm--six\nsummers, and a new lot never less than once a month.  They won't stand\nfor the country and the lonesomeness, I reckon.\"\n\nBut with the presence of the \"bunch\" of servants my courage revived,\nand late in the afternoon came a message from Gertrude that she and\nHalsey would arrive that night at about eleven o'clock, coming in the\ncar from Richfield.  Things were looking up; and when Beulah, my cat, a\nmost intelligent animal, found some early catnip on a bank near the\nhouse and rolled in it in a feline ecstasy, I decided that getting back\nto nature was the thing to do.\n\nWhile I was dressing for dinner, Liddy rapped at the door.  She was\nhardly herself yet, but privately I think she was worrying about the\nbroken mirror and its augury, more than anything else. When she came in\nshe was holding something in her hand, and she laid it on the\ndressing-table carefully.\n\n\"I found it in the linen hamper,\" she said.  \"It must be Mr. Halsey's,\nbut it seems queer how it got there.\"\n\nIt was the half of a link cuff-button of unique design, and I looked at\nit carefully.\n\n\"Where was it?  In the bottom of the hamper?\" I asked.\n\n\"On the very top,\" she replied.  \"It's a mercy it didn't fall out on\nthe way.\"\n\nWhen Liddy had gone I examined the fragment attentively.  I had never\nseen it before, and I was certain it was not Halsey's.  It was of\nItalian workmanship, and consisted of a mother-of-pearl foundation,\nencrusted with tiny seed-pearls, strung on horsehair to hold them.  In\nthe center was a small ruby.  The trinket was odd enough, but not\nintrinsically of great value.  Its interest for me lay in this:  Liddy\nhad found it lying in the top of the hamper which had blocked the\neast-wing stairs.\n\nThat afternoon the Armstrongs' housekeeper, a youngish good-looking\nwoman, applied for Mrs. Ralston's place, and I was glad enough to take\nher.  She looked as though she might be equal to a dozen of Liddy, with\nher snapping black eyes and heavy jaw.  Her name was Anne Watson, and I\ndined that evening for the first time in three days.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nMR. JOHN BAILEY APPEARS\n\nI had dinner served in the breakfast-room.  Somehow the huge\ndining-room depressed me, and Thomas, cheerful enough all day, allowed\nhis spirits to go down with the sun.  He had a habit of watching the\ncorners of the room, left shadowy by the candles on the table, and\naltogether it was not a festive meal.\n\nDinner over I went into the living-room.  I had three hours before the\nchildren could possibly arrive, and I got out my knitting.  I had\nbrought along two dozen pairs of slipper soles in assorted sizes--I\nalways send knitted slippers to the Old Ladies' Home at Christmas--and\nnow I sorted over the wools with a grim determination not to think\nabout the night before.  But my mind was not on my work: at the end of\na half-hour I found I had put a row of blue scallops on Eliza\nKlinefelter's lavender slippers, and I put them away.\n\nI got out the cuff-link and went with it to the pantry.  Thomas was\nwiping silver and the air was heavy with tobacco smoke.  I sniffed and\nlooked around, but there was no pipe to be seen.\n\n\"Thomas,\" I said, \"you have been smoking.\"\n\n\"No, ma'm.\"  He was injured innocence itself.  \"It's on my coat, ma'm.\nOver at the club the gentlemen--\"\n\nBut Thomas did not finish.  The pantry was suddenly filled with the\nodor of singeing cloth.  Thomas gave a clutch at his coat, whirled to\nthe sink, filled a tumbler with water and poured it into his right\npocket with the celerity of practice.\n\n\"Thomas,\" I said, when he was sheepishly mopping the floor, \"smoking is\na filthy and injurious habit.  If you must smoke, you must; but don't\nstick a lighted pipe in your pocket again.  Your skin's your own: you\ncan blister it if you like.  But this house is not mine, and I don't\nwant a conflagration.  Did you ever see this cuff-link before?\"\n\nNo, he never had, he said, but he looked at it oddly.\n\n\"I picked it up in the hall,\" I added indifferently.  The old man's\neyes were shrewd under his bushy eyebrows.\n\n\"There's strange goin's-on here, Mis' Innes,\" he said, shaking his\nhead.  \"Somethin's goin' to happen, sure.  You ain't took notice that\nthe big clock in the hall is stopped, I reckon?\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I said.  \"Clocks have to stop, don't they, if they're not\nwound?\"\n\n\"It's wound up, all right, and it stopped at three o'clock last night,\"\nhe answered solemnly.  \"More'n that, that there clock ain't stopped for\nfifteen years, not since Mr. Armstrong's first wife died.  And that\nain't all,--no MA'M.  Last three nights I slep' in this place, after\nthe electrics went out I had a token. My oil lamp was full of oil, but\nit kep' goin' out, do what I would.  Minute I shet my eyes, out that\nlamp'd go.  There ain't no surer token of death.  The Bible sez, LET\nYER LIGHT SHINE! When a hand you can't see puts yer light out, it means\ndeath, sure.\"\n\nThe old man's voice was full of conviction.  In spite of myself I had a\nchilly sensation in the small of my back, and I left him mumbling over\nhis dishes.  Later on I heard a crash from the pantry, and Liddy\nreported that Beulah, who is coal black, had darted in front of Thomas\njust as he picked up a tray of dishes; that the bad omen had been too\nmuch for him, and he had dropped the tray.\n\nThe chug of the automobile as it climbed the hill was the most welcome\nsound I had heard for a long time, and with Gertrude and Halsey\nactually before me, my troubles seemed over for good. Gertrude stood\nsmiling in the hall, with her hat quite over one ear, and her hair in\nevery direction under her pink veil. Gertrude is a very pretty girl, no\nmatter how her hat is, and I was not surprised when Halsey presented a\ngood-looking young man, who bowed at me and looked at Trude--that is\nthe ridiculous nickname Gertrude brought from school.\n\n\"I have brought a guest, Aunt Ray,\" Halsey said.  \"I want you to adopt\nhim into your affections and your Saturday-to-Monday list. Let me\npresent John Bailey, only you must call him Jack.  In twelve hours\nhe'll be calling you 'Aunt': I know him.\"\n\nWe shook hands, and I got a chance to look at Mr. Bailey; he was a tall\nfellow, perhaps thirty, and he wore a small mustache.  I remember\nwondering why: he seemed to have a good mouth and when he smiled his\nteeth were above the average.  One never knows why certain men cling to\na messy upper lip that must get into things, any more than one\nunderstands some women building up their hair on wire atrocities.\nOtherwise, he was very good to look at, stalwart and tanned, with the\ndirect gaze that I like. I am particular about Mr. Bailey, because he\nwas a prominent figure in what happened later.\n\nGertrude was tired with the trip and went up to bed very soon.  I made\nup my mind to tell them nothing; until the next day, and then to make\nas light of our excitement as possible.  After all, what had I to tell?\nAn inquisitive face peering in at a window; a crash in the night; a\nscratch or two on the stairs, and half a cuff-button!  As for Thomas\nand his forebodings, it was always my belief that a negro is one part\nthief, one part pigment, and the rest superstition.\n\nIt was Saturday night.  The two men went to the billiard-room, and I\ncould hear them talking as I went up-stairs.  It seemed that Halsey had\nstopped at the Greenwood Club for gasolene and found Jack Bailey there,\nwith the Sunday golf crowd.  Mr. Bailey had not been hard to\npersuade--probably Gertrude knew why--and they had carried him off\ntriumphantly.  I roused Liddy to get them something to eat--Thomas was\nbeyond reach in the lodge--and paid no attention to her evident terror\nof the kitchen regions.  Then I went to bed.  The men were still in the\nbilliard-room when I finally dozed off, and the last thing I remember\nwas the howl of a dog in front of the house.  It wailed a crescendo of\nwoe that trailed off hopefully, only to break out afresh from a new\npoint of the compass.\n\nAt three o'clock in the morning I was roused by a revolver shot. The\nsound seemed to come from just outside my door.  For a moment I could\nnot move.  Then--I heard Gertrude stirring in her room, and the next\nmoment she had thrown open the connecting door.\n\n\"O Aunt Ray!  Aunt Ray!\" she cried hysterically.  \"Some one has been\nkilled, killed!\"\n\n\"Thieves,\" I said shortly.  \"Thank goodness, there are some men in the\nhouse to-night.\"  I was getting into my slippers and a bath-robe, and\nGertrude with shaking hands was lighting a lamp. Then we opened the\ndoor into the hall, where, crowded on the upper landing of the stairs,\nthe maids, white-faced and trembling, were peering down, headed by\nLiddy.  I was greeted by a series of low screams and questions, and I\ntried to quiet them.\n\nGertrude had dropped on a chair and sat there limp and shivering.\n\nI went at once across the hall to Halsey's room and knocked; then I\npushed the door open.  It was empty; the bed had not been occupied!\n\n\"He must be in Mr. Bailey's room,\" I said excitedly, and followed by\nLiddy, we went there.  Like Halsey's, it had not been occupied!\nGertrude was on her feet now, but she leaned against the door for\nsupport.\n\n\"They have been killed!\" she gasped.  Then she caught me by the arm and\ndragged me toward the stairs.  \"They may only be hurt, and we must find\nthem,\" she said, her eyes dilated with excitement.\n\nI don't remember how we got down the stairs: I do remember expecting\nevery moment to be killed.  The cook was at the telephone up-stairs,\ncalling the Greenwood Club, and Liddy was behind me, afraid to come and\nnot daring to stay behind.  We found the living-room and the\ndrawing-room undisturbed.  Somehow I felt that whatever we found would\nbe in the card-room or on the staircase, and nothing but the fear that\nHalsey was in danger drove me on; with every step my knees seemed to\ngive way under me.  Gertrude was ahead and in the card-room she\nstopped, holding her candle high.  Then she pointed silently to the\ndoorway into the hall beyond.  Huddled there on the floor, face down,\nwith his arms extended, was a man.\n\nGertrude ran forward with a gasping sob.  \"Jack,\" she cried, \"oh, Jack!\"\n\nLiddy had run, screaming, and the two of us were there alone.  It was\nGertrude who turned him over, finally, until we could see his white\nface, and then she drew a deep breath and dropped limply to her knees.\nIt was the body of a man, a gentleman, in a dinner coat and white\nwaistcoat, stained now with blood--the body of a man I had never seen\nbefore.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWHERE IS HALSEY?\n\nGertrude gazed at the face in a kind of fascination.  Then she put out\nher hands blindly, and I thought she was going to faint.\n\n\"He has killed him!\"  she muttered almost inarticulately; and at that,\nbecause my nerves were going, I gave her a good shake.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I said frantically.  There was a depth of grief and\nconviction in her tone that was worse than anything she could have\nsaid.  The shake braced her, anyhow, and she seemed to pull herself\ntogether.  But not another word would she say: she stood gazing down at\nthat gruesome figure on the floor, while Liddy, ashamed of her flight\nand afraid to come back alone, drove before her three terrified\nwomen-servants into the drawing-room, which was as near as any of them\nwould venture.\n\nOnce in the drawing-room, Gertrude collapsed and went from one fainting\nspell into another.  I had all I could do to keep Liddy from drowning\nher with cold water, and the maids huddled in a corner, as much use as\nso many sheep.  In a short time, although it seemed hours, a car came\nrushing up, and Anne Watson, who had waited to dress, opened the door.\nThree men from the Greenwood Club, in all kinds of costumes, hurried\nin.  I recognized a Mr. Jarvis, but the others were strangers.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" the Jarvis man asked--and we made a strange picture, no\ndoubt.  \"Nobody hurt, is there?\"  He was looking at Gertrude.\n\n\"Worse than that, Mr. Jarvis,\" I said.  \"I think it is murder.\"\n\nAt the word there was a commotion.  The cook began to cry, and Mrs.\nWatson knocked over a chair.  The men were visibly impressed.\n\n\"Not any member of the family?\" Mr. Jarvis asked, when he had got his\nbreath.\n\n\"No,\" I said; and motioning Liddy to look after Gertrude, I led the way\nwith a lamp to the card-room door.  One of the men gave an exclamation,\nand they all hurried across the room.  Mr. Jarvis took the lamp from\nme--I remember that--and then, feeling myself getting dizzy and\nlight-headed, I closed my eyes.  When I opened them their brief\nexamination was over, and Mr. Jarvis was trying to put me in a chair.\n\n\"You must get up-stairs,\" he said firmly, \"you and Miss Gertrude, too.\nThis has been a terrible shock.  In his own home, too.\"\n\nI stared at him without comprehension.  \"Who is it?\" I asked with\ndifficulty.  There was a band drawn tight around my throat.\n\n\"It is Arnold Armstrong,\" he said, looking at me oddly, \"and he has\nbeen murdered in his father's house.\"\n\nAfter a minute I gathered myself together and Mr. Jarvis helped me into\nthe living-room.  Liddy had got Gertrude up-stairs, and the two strange\nmen from the club stayed with the body.  The reaction from the shock\nand strain was tremendous: I was collapsed--and then Mr. Jarvis asked\nme a question that brought back my wandering faculties.\n\n\"Where is Halsey?\" he asked.\n\n\"Halsey!\"  Suddenly Gertrude's stricken face rose before me the empty\nrooms up-stairs.  Where was Halsey?\n\n\"He was here, wasn't he?\" Mr. Jarvis persisted.  \"He stopped at the\nclub on his way over.\"\n\n\"I--don't know where he is,\" I said feebly.\n\nOne of the men from the club came in, asked for the telephone, and I\ncould hear him excitedly talking, saying something about coroners and\ndetectives.  Mr. Jarvis leaned over to me.\n\n\"Why don't you trust me, Miss Innes?\" he said.  \"If I can do anything I\nwill.  But tell me the whole thing.\"\n\nI did, finally, from the beginning, and when I told of Jack Bailey's\nbeing in the house that night, he gave a long whistle.\n\n\"I wish they were both here,\" he said when I finished.  \"Whatever mad\nprank took them away, it would look better if they were here.\nEspecially--\"\n\n\"Especially what?\"\n\n\"Especially since Jack Bailey and Arnold Armstrong were notoriously bad\nfriends.  It was Bailey who got Arnold into trouble last\nspring--something about the bank.  And then, too--\"\n\n\"Go on,\" I said.  \"If there is anything more, I ought to know.\"\n\n\"There's nothing more,\" he said evasively.  \"There's just one thing we\nmay bank on, Miss Innes.  Any court in the country will acquit a man\nwho kills an intruder in his house, at night.  If Halsey--\"\n\n\"Why, you don't think Halsey did it!\" I exclaimed.  There was a queer\nfeeling of physical nausea coming over me.\n\n\"No, no, not at all,\" he said with forced cheerfulness.  \"Come, Miss\nInnes, you're a ghost of yourself and I am going to help you up-stairs\nand call your maid.  This has been too much for you.\"\n\nLiddy helped me back to bed, and under the impression that I was in\ndanger of freezing to death, put a hot-water bottle over my heart and\nanother at my feet.  Then she left me.  It was early dawn now, and from\nvoices under my window I surmised that Mr. Jarvis and his companions\nwere searching the grounds.  As for me, I lay in bed, with every\nfaculty awake.  Where had Halsey gone? How had he gone, and when?\nBefore the murder, no doubt, but who would believe that?  If either he\nor Jack Bailey had heard an intruder in the house and shot him--as they\nmight have been justified in doing--why had they run away?  The whole\nthing was unheard of, outrageous, and--impossible to ignore.\n\nAbout six o'clock Gertrude came in.  She was fully dressed, and I sat\nup nervously.\n\n\"Poor Aunty!\" she said.  \"What a shocking night you have had!\" She came\nover and sat down on the bed, and I saw she looked very tired and worn.\n\n\"Is there anything new?\" I asked anxiously.\n\n\"Nothing.  The car is gone, but Warner\"--he is the chauffeur--\"Warner\nis at the lodge and knows nothing about it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if I ever get my hands on Halsey Innes, I shall not\nlet go until I have told him a few things.  When we get this cleared\nup, I am going back to the city to be quiet.  One more night like the\nlast two will end me.  The peace of the country--fiddle sticks!\"\n\nWhereupon I told Gertrude of the noises the night before, and the\nfigure on the veranda in the east wing.  As an afterthought I brought\nout the pearl cuff-link.\n\n\"I have no doubt now,\" I said, \"that it was Arnold Armstrong the night\nbefore last, too.  He had a key, no doubt, but why he should steal into\nhis father's house I can not imagine.  He could have come with my\npermission, easily enough.  Anyhow, whoever it was that night, left\nthis little souvenir.\"\n\nGertrude took one look at the cuff-link, and went as white as the\npearls in it; she clutched at the foot of the bed, and stood staring.\nAs for me, I was quite as astonished as she was.\n\n\"Where did--you--find it?\" she asked finally, with a desperate effort\nat calm.  And while I told her she stood looking out of the window with\na look I could not fathom on her face.  It was a relief when Mrs.\nWatson tapped at the door and brought me some tea and toast.  The cook\nwas in bed, completely demoralized, she reported, and Liddy, brave with\nthe daylight, was looking for footprints around the house.  Mrs. Watson\nherself was a wreck; she was blue-white around the lips, and she had\none hand tied up.\n\nShe said she had fallen down-stairs in her excitement.  It was natural,\nof course, that the thing would shock her, having been the Armstrongs'\nhousekeeper for several years, and knowing Mr. Arnold well.\n\nGertrude had slipped out during my talk with Mrs. Watson, and I dressed\nand went down-stairs.  The billiard and card-rooms were locked until\nthe coroner and the detectives got there, and the men from the club had\ngone back for more conventional clothing.\n\nI could hear Thomas in the pantry, alternately wailing for Mr. Arnold,\nas he called him, and citing the tokens that had precursed the murder.\nThe house seemed to choke me, and, slipping a shawl around me, I went\nout on the drive.  At the corner by the east wing I met Liddy.  Her\nskirts were draggled with dew to her knees, and her hair was still in\ncrimps.\n\n\"Go right in and change your clothes,\" I said sharply.  \"You're a\nsight, and at your age!\"\n\nShe had a golf-stick in her hand, and she said she had found it on the\nlawn.  There was nothing unusual about it, but it occurred to me that a\ngolf-stick with a metal end might have been the object that had\nscratched the stairs near the card-room.  I took it from her, and sent\nher up for dry garments.  Her daylight courage and self-importance, and\nher shuddering delight in the mystery, irritated me beyond words.\nAfter I left her I made a circuit of the building.  Nothing seemed to\nbe disturbed: the house looked as calm and peaceful in the morning sun\nas it had the day I had been coerced into taking it.  There was nothing\nto show that inside had been mystery and violence and sudden death.\n\nIn one of the tulip beds back of the house an early blackbird was\npecking viciously at something that glittered in the light. I picked my\nway gingerly over through the dew and stooped down: almost buried in\nthe soft ground was a revolver!  I scraped the earth off it with the\ntip of my shoe, and, picking it up, slipped it into my pocket.  Not\nuntil I had got into my bedroom and double-locked the door did I\nventure to take it out and examine it.  One look was all I needed.  It\nwas Halsey's revolver.  I had unpacked it the day before and put it on\nhis shaving-stand, and there could be no mistake.  His name was on a\nsmall silver plate on the handle.\n\nI seemed to see a network closing around my boy, innocent as I knew he\nwas.  The revolver--I am afraid of them, but anxiety gave me courage to\nlook through the barrel--the revolver had still two bullets in it.  I\ncould only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that I had found the\nrevolver before any sharp-eyed detective had come around.\n\nI decided to keep what clues I had, the cuff-link, the golf-stick and\nthe revolver, in a secure place until I could see some reason for\ndisplaying them.  The cuff-link had been dropped into a little filigree\nbox on my toilet table.  I opened the box and felt around for it.  The\nbox was empty--the cuff-link had disappeared!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nGERTRUDE'S ENGAGEMENT\n\nAt ten o'clock the Casanova hack brought up three men.  They introduced\nthemselves as the coroner of the county and two detectives from the\ncity.  The coroner led the way at once to the locked wing, and with the\naid of one of the detectives examined the rooms and the body.  The\nother detective, after a short scrutiny of the dead man, busied himself\nwith the outside of the house.  It was only after they had got a fair\nidea of things as they were that they sent for me.\n\nI received them in the living-room, and I had made up my mind exactly\nwhat to tell.  I had taken the house for the summer, I said, while the\nArmstrongs were in California.  In spite of a rumor among the servants\nabout strange noises--I cited Thomas--nothing had occurred the first\ntwo nights.  On the third night I believed that some one had been in\nthe house: I had heard a crashing sound, but being alone with one maid\nhad not investigated.  The house had been locked in the morning and\napparently undisturbed.\n\nThen, as clearly as I could, I related how, the night before, a shot\nhad roused us; that my niece and I had investigated and found a body;\nthat I did not know who the murdered man was until Mr. Jarvis from the\nclub informed me, and that I knew of no reason why Mr. Arnold Armstrong\nshould steal into his father's house at night.  I should have been glad\nto allow him entree there at any time.\n\n\"Have you reason to believe, Miss Innes,\" the coroner asked, \"that any\nmember of your household, imagining Mr. Armstrong was a burglar, shot\nhim in self-defense?\"\n\n\"I have no reason for thinking so,\" I said quietly.\n\n\"Your theory is that Mr. Armstrong was followed here by some enemy, and\nshot as he entered the house?\"\n\n\"I don't think I have a theory,\" I said.  \"The thing that has puzzled\nme is why Mr. Armstrong should enter his father's house two nights in\nsuccession, stealing in like a thief, when he needed only to ask\nentrance to be admitted.\"\n\nThe coroner was a very silent man: he took some notes after this, but\nhe seemed anxious to make the next train back to town.  He set the\ninquest for the following Saturday, gave Mr. Jamieson, the younger of\nthe two detectives, and the more intelligent looking, a few\ninstructions, and, after gravely shaking hands with me and regretting\nthe unfortunate affair, took his departure, accompanied by the other\ndetective.\n\nI was just beginning to breathe freely when Mr. Jamieson, who had been\nstanding by the window, came over to me.\n\n\"The family consists of yourself alone, Miss Innes?\"\n\n\"My niece is here,\" I said.\n\n\"There is no one but yourself and your niece?\"\n\n\"My nephew.\"  I had to moisten my lips.\n\n\"Oh, a nephew.  I should like to see him, if he is here.\"\n\n\"He is not here just now,\" I said as quietly as I could.  \"I expect\nhim--at any time.\"\n\n\"He was here yesterday evening, I believe?\"\n\n\"No--yes.\"\n\n\"Didn't he have a guest with him?  Another man?\"\n\n\"He brought a friend with him to stay over Sunday, Mr. Bailey.\"\n\n\"Mr. John Bailey, the cashier of the Traders' Bank I believe.\" And I\nknew that some one at the Greenwood Club had told.  \"When did they\nleave?\"\n\n\"Very early--I don't know at just what time.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson turned suddenly and looked at me.\n\n\"Please try to be more explicit,\" he said.  \"You say your nephew and\nMr. Bailey were in the house last night, and yet you and your niece,\nwith some women-servants, found the body.  Where was your nephew?\"\n\nI was entirely desperate by that time.\n\n\"I do not know,\" I cried, \"but be sure of this: Halsey knows nothing of\nthis thing, and no amount of circumstantial evidence can make an\ninnocent man guilty.\"\n\n\"Sit down,\" he said, pushing forward a chair.  \"There are some things I\nhave to tell you, and, in return, please tell me all you know.  Believe\nme, things always come out.  In the first place, Mr. Armstrong was shot\nfrom above.  The bullet was fired at close range, entered below the\nshoulder and came out, after passing through the heart, well down the\nback.  In other words, I believe the murderer stood on the stairs and\nfired down.  In the second place, I found on the edge of the\nbilliard-table a charred cigar which had burned itself partly out, and\na cigarette which had consumed itself to the cork tip.  Neither one had\nbeen more than lighted, then put down and forgotten.  Have you any idea\nwhat it was that made your nephew and Mr. Bailey leave their cigars and\ntheir game, take out the automobile without calling the chauffeur, and\nall this at--let me see certainly before three o'clock in the morning?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" I said; \"but depend on it, Mr. Jamieson, Halsey will be\nback himself to explain everything.\"\n\n\"I sincerely hope so,\" he said.  \"Miss Innes, has it occurred to you\nthat Mr. Bailey might know something of this?\"\n\nGertrude had come down-stairs and just as he spoke she came in. I saw\nher stop suddenly, as if she had been struck.\n\n\"He does not,\" she said in a tone that was not her own.  \"Mr. Bailey\nand my brother know nothing of this.  The murder was committed at\nthree.  They left the house at a quarter before three.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" Mr. Jamieson asked oddly.  \"Do you KNOW at what\ntime they left?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Gertrude answered firmly.  \"At a quarter before three my\nbrother and Mr. Bailey left the house, by the main entrance.\nI--was--there.\"\n\n\"Gertrude,\" I said excitedly, \"you are dreaming!  Why, at a quarter to\nthree--\"\n\n\"Listen,\" she said.  \"At half-past two the downstairs telephone rang.\nI had not gone to sleep, and I heard it.  Then I heard Halsey answer\nit, and in a few minutes he came up-stairs and knocked at my door.\nWe--we talked for a minute, then I put on my dressing-gown and\nslippers, and went down-stairs with him.  Mr. Bailey was in the\nbilliard-room.  We--we all talked together for perhaps ten minutes.\nThen it was decided that--that they should both go away--\"\n\n\"Can't you be more explicit?\" Mr. Jamieson asked.  \"WHY did they go\naway?\"\n\n\"I am only telling you what happened, not why it happened,\" she said\nevenly.  \"Halsey went for the car, and instead of bringing it to the\nhouse and rousing people, he went by the lower road from the stable.\nMr. Bailey was to meet him at the foot of the lawn.  Mr. Bailey left--\"\n\n\"Which way?\" Mr. Jamieson asked sharply.\n\n\"By the main entrance.  He left--it was a quarter to three.  I know\nexactly.\"\n\n\"The clock in the hall is stopped, Miss Innes,\" said Jamieson. Nothing\nseemed to escape him.\n\n\"He looked at his watch,\" she replied, and I could see Mr. Jamieson's\nsnap, as if he had made a discovery.  As for myself, during the whole\nrecital I had been plunged into the deepest amazement.\n\n\"Will you pardon me for a personal question?\"  The detective was a\nyoungish man, and I thought he was somewhat embarrassed.  \"What are\nyour--your relations with Mr. Bailey?\"\n\nGertrude hesitated.  Then she came over and put her hand lovingly in\nmine.\n\n\"I am engaged to marry him,\" she said simply.\n\nI had grown so accustomed to surprises that I could only gasp again,\nand as for Gertrude, the hand that lay in mine was burning with fever.\n\n\"And--after that,\" Mr. Jamieson went on, \"you went directly to bed?\"\n\nGertrude hesitated.\n\n\"No,\" she said finally.  \"I--I am not nervous, and after I had\nextinguished the light, I remembered something I had left in the\nbilliard-room, and I felt my way back there through the darkness.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me what it was you had forgotten?\"\n\n\"I can not tell you,\" she said slowly.  \"I--I did not leave the\nbilliard-room at once--\"\n\n\"Why?\"  The detective's tone was imperative.  \"This is very important,\nMiss Innes.\"\n\n\"I was crying,\" Gertrude said in a low tone.  \"When the French clock in\nthe drawing-room struck three, I got up, and then--I heard a step on\nthe east porch, just outside the card-room.  Some one with a key was\nworking with the latch, and I thought, of course, of Halsey.  When we\ntook the house he called that his entrance, and he had carried a key\nfor it ever since.  The door opened and I was about to ask what he had\nforgotten, when there was a flash and a report.  Some heavy body\ndropped, and, half crazed with terror and shock, I ran through the\ndrawing-room and got up-stairs--I scarcely remember how.\"\n\nShe dropped into a chair, and I thought Mr. Jamieson must have\nfinished.  But he was not through.\n\n\"You certainly clear your brother and Mr. Bailey admirably,\" he said.\n\"The testimony is invaluable, especially in view of the fact that your\nbrother and Mr. Armstrong had, I believe, quarreled rather seriously\nsome time ago.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I broke in.  \"Things are bad enough, Mr. Jamieson, without\ninventing bad feeling where it doesn't exist.  Gertrude, I don't think\nHalsey knew the--the murdered man, did he?\"\n\nBut Mr. Jamieson was sure of his ground.\n\n\"The quarrel, I believe,\" he persisted, \"was about Mr. Armstrong's\nconduct to you, Miss Gertrude.  He had been paying you unwelcome\nattentions.\"\n\nAnd I had never seen the man!\n\nWhen she nodded a \"yes\" I saw the tremendous possibilities involved.\nIf this detective could prove that Gertrude feared and disliked the\nmurdered man, and that Mr. Armstrong had been annoying and possibly\npursuing her with hateful attentions, all that, added to Gertrude's\nconfession of her presence in the billiard-room at the time of the\ncrime, looked strange, to say the least.  The prominence of the family\nassured a strenuous effort to find the murderer, and if we had nothing\nworse to look forward to, we were sure of a distasteful publicity.\n\nMr. Jamieson shut his note-book with a snap, and thanked us.\n\n\"I have an idea,\" he said, apropos of nothing at all, \"that at any rate\nthe ghost is laid here.  Whatever the rappings have been--and the\ncolored man says they began when the family went west three months\nago--they are likely to stop now.\"\n\nWhich shows how much he knew about it.  The ghost was not laid: with\nthe murder of Arnold Armstrong he, or it, only seemed to take on fresh\nvigor.\n\nMr. Jamieson left then, and when Gertrude had gone up-stairs, as she\ndid at once, I sat and thought over what I had just heard. Her\nengagement, once so engrossing a matter, paled now beside the\nsignificance of her story.  If Halsey and Jack Bailey had left before\nthe crime, how came Halsey's revolver in the tulip bed? What was the\nmysterious cause of their sudden flight?  What had Gertrude left in the\nbilliard-room?  What was the significance of the cuff-link, and where\nwas it?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIN THE EAST CORRIDOR\n\nWhen the detective left he enjoined absolute secrecy on everybody in\nthe household.  The Greenwood Club promised the same thing, and as\nthere are no Sunday afternoon papers, the murder was not publicly known\nuntil Monday.  The coroner himself notified the Armstrong family\nlawyer, and early in the afternoon he came out. I had not seen Mr.\nJamieson since morning, but I knew he had been interrogating the\nservants.  Gertrude was locked in her room with a headache, and I had\nluncheon alone.\n\nMr. Harton, the lawyer, was a little, thin man, and he looked as if he\ndid not relish his business that day.\n\n\"This is very unfortunate, Miss Innes,\" he said, after we had shaken\nhands.  \"Most unfortunate--and mysterious.  With the father and mother\nin the west, I find everything devolves on me; and, as you can\nunderstand, it is an unpleasant duty.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" I said absently.  \"Mr. Harton, I am going to ask you some\nquestions, and I hope you will answer them.  I feel that I am entitled\nto some knowledge, because I and my family are just now in a most\nambiguous position.\"\n\nI don't know whether he understood me or not: he took of his glasses\nand wiped them.\n\n\"I shall be very happy,\" he said with old-fashioned courtesy.\n\n\"Thank you.  Mr. Harton, did Mr. Arnold Armstrong know that Sunnyside\nhad been rented?\"\n\n\"I think--yes, he did.  In fact, I myself told him about it.\"\n\n\"And he knew who the tenants were?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"He had not been living with the family for some years, I believe?\"\n\n\"No.  Unfortunately, there had been trouble between Arnold and his\nfather.  For two years he had lived in town.\"\n\n\"Then it would be unlikely that he came here last night to get\npossession of anything belonging to him?\"\n\n\"I should think it hardly possible,\" he admitted.\n\n\"To be perfectly frank, Miss Innes, I can not think of any reason\nwhatever for his coming here as he did.  He had been staying at the\nclub-house across the valley for the last week, Jarvis tells me, but\nthat only explains how he came here, not why.  It is a most unfortunate\nfamily.\"\n\nHe shook his head despondently, and I felt that this dried-up little\nman was the repository of much that he had not told me.  I gave up\ntrying to elicit any information from him, and we went together to view\nthe body before it was taken to the city.  It had been lifted on to the\nbilliard-table and a sheet thrown over it; otherwise nothing had been\ntouched.  A soft hat lay beside it, and the collar of the dinner-coat\nwas still turned up.  The handsome, dissipated face of Arnold\nArmstrong, purged of its ugly lines, was now only pathetic.  As we went\nin Mrs. Watson appeared at the card-room door.\n\n\"Come in, Mrs. Watson,\" the lawyer said.  But she shook her head and\nwithdrew: she was the only one in the house who seemed to regret the\ndead man, and even she seemed rather shocked than sorry.\n\nI went to the door at the foot of the circular staircase and opened it.\nIf I could only have seen Halsey coming at his usual hare-brained clip\nup the drive, if I could have heard the throb of the motor, I would\nhave felt that my troubles were over.\n\nBut there was nothing to be seen.  The countryside lay sunny and quiet\nin its peaceful Sunday afternoon calm, and far down the drive Mr.\nJamieson was walking slowly, stooping now and then, as if to examine\nthe road.  When I went back, Mr. Harton was furtively wiping his eyes.\n\n\"The prodigal has come home, Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"How often the sins\nof the fathers are visited on the children!\"  Which left me pondering.\n\nBefore Mr. Harton left, he told me something of the Armstrong family.\nPaul Armstrong, the father, had been married twice. Arnold was a son by\nthe first marriage.  The second Mrs. Armstrong had been a widow, with a\nchild, a little girl.  This child, now perhaps twenty, was Louise\nArmstrong, having taken her stepfather's name, and was at present in\nCalifornia with the family.\n\n\"They will probably return at once,\" he concluded \"sad part of my\nerrand here to-day is to see if you will relinquish your lease here in\ntheir favor.\"\n\n\"We would better wait and see if they wish to come,\" I said. \"It seems\nunlikely, and my town house is being remodeled.\"  At that he let the\nmatter drop, but it came up unpleasantly enough, later.\n\nAt six o'clock the body was taken away, and at seven-thirty, after an\nearly dinner, Mr. Harton went.  Gertrude had not come down, and there\nwas no news of Halsey.  Mr. Jamieson had taken a lodging in the\nvillage, and I had not seen him since mid-afternoon.  It was about nine\no'clock, I think, when the bell rang and he was ushered into the\nliving-room.\n\n\"Sit down,\" I said grimly.  \"Have you found a clue that will\nincriminate me, Mr. Jamieson?\"\n\nHe had the grace to look uncomfortable.  \"No,\" he said.  \"If you had\nkilled Mr. Armstrong, you would have left no clues.  You would have had\ntoo much intelligence.\"\n\nAfter that we got along better.  He was fishing in his pocket, and\nafter a minute he brought out two scraps of paper.  \"I have been to the\nclub-house,\" he said, \"and among Mr. Armstrong's effects, I found\nthese.  One is curious; the other is puzzling.\"\n\nThe first was a sheet of club note-paper, on which was written, over\nand over, the name \"Halsey B. Innes.\"  It was Halsey's flowing\nsignature to a dot, but it lacked Halsey's ease.  The ones toward the\nbottom of the sheet were much better than the top ones.  Mr. Jamieson\nsmiled at my face.\n\n\"His old tricks,\" he said.  \"That one is merely curious; this one, as I\nsaid before, is puzzling.\"\n\nThe second scrap, folded and refolded into a compass so tiny that the\nwriting had been partly obliterated, was part of a letter--the lower\nhalf of a sheet, not typed, but written in a cramped hand.\n\n\n\"----by altering the plans for----rooms, may be possible.  The best\nway, in my opinion, would be to----the plan for----in one of\nthe----rooms----chimney.\"\n\n\nThat was all.\n\n\"Well?\" I said, looking up.  \"There is nothing in that, is there? A man\nought to be able to change the plan of his house without becoming an\nobject of suspicion.\"\n\n\"There is little in the paper itself,\" he admitted; \"but why should\nArnold Armstrong carry that around, unless it meant something?  He\nnever built a house, you may be sure of that.  If it is this house, it\nmay mean anything, from a secret room--\"\n\n\"To an extra bath-room,\" I said scornfully.  \"Haven't you a\nthumb-print, too?\"\n\n\"I have,\" he said with a smile, \"and the print of a foot in a tulip\nbed, and a number of other things.  The oddest part is, Miss Innes,\nthat the thumb-mark is probably yours and the footprint certainly.\"\n\nHis audacity was the only thing that saved me: his amused smile put me\non my mettle, and I ripped out a perfectly good scallop before I\nanswered.\n\n\"Why did I step into the tulip bed?\" I asked with interest.\n\n\"You picked up something,\" he said good-humoredly, \"which you are going\nto tell me about later.\"\n\n\"Am I, indeed?\" I was politely curious.  \"With this remarkable insight\nof yours, I wish you would tell me where I shall find my\nfour-thousand-dollar motor car.\"\n\n\"I was just coming to that,\" he said.  \"You will find it about thirty\nmiles away, at Andrews Station, in a blacksmith shop, where it is being\nrepaired.\"\n\nI laid down my knitting then and looked at him.\n\n\"And Halsey?\" I managed to say.\n\n\"We are going to exchange information,\" he said \"I am going to tell you\nthat, when you tell me what you picked up in the tulip bed.\"\n\nWe looked steadily at each other: it was not an unfriendly stare; we\nwere only measuring weapons.  Then he smiled a little and got up.\n\n\"With your permission,\" he said, \"I am going to examine the card-room\nand the staircase again.  You might think over my offer in the\nmeantime.\"\n\nHe went on through the drawing-room, and I listened to his footsteps\ngrowing gradually fainter.  I dropped my pretense at knitting and,\nleaning back, I thought over the last forty-eight hours.  Here was I,\nRachel Innes, spinster, a granddaughter of old John Innes of\nRevolutionary days, a D. A. R., a Colonial Dame, mixed up with a vulgar\nand revolting crime, and even attempting to hoodwink the law!\nCertainly I had left the straight and narrow way.\n\nI was roused by hearing Mr. Jamieson coming rapidly back through the\ndrawing-room.  He stopped at the door.\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said quickly, \"will you come with me and light the\neast corridor?  I have fastened somebody in the small room at the head\nof the card-room stairs.\"\n\nI jumped! up at once.\n\n\"You mean--the murderer?\" I gasped.\n\n\"Possibly,\" he said quietly, as we hurried together up the stairs.\n\"Some one was lurking on the staircase when I went back. I spoke;\ninstead of an answer, whoever it was turned and ran up. I followed--it\nwas dark--but as I turned the corner at the top a figure darted through\nthis door and closed it.  The bolt was on my side, and I pushed it\nforward.  It is a closet, I think.\"  We were in the upper hall now.\n\"If you will show me the electric switch, Miss Innes, you would better\nwait in your own room.\"\n\nTrembling as I was, I was determined to see that door opened.  I hardly\nknew what I feared, but so many terrible and inexplicable things had\nhappened that suspense was worse than certainty.\n\n\"I am perfectly cool,\" I said, \"and I am going to remain here.\"\n\nThe lights flashed up along that end of the corridor, throwing the\ndoors into relief.  At the intersection of the small hallway with the\nlarger, the circular staircase wound its way up, as if it had been an\nafterthought of the architect.  And just around the corner, in the\nsmall corridor, was the door Mr. Jamieson had indicated.  I was still\nunfamiliar with the house, and I did not remember the door.  My heart\nwas thumping wildly in my ears, but I nodded to him to go ahead.  I was\nperhaps eight or ten feet away--and then he threw the bolt back.\n\n\"Come out,\" he said quietly.  There was no response.  \"Come--out,\" he\nrepeated.  Then--I think he had a revolver, but I am not sure--he\nstepped aside and threw the door open.\n\nFrom where I stood I could not see beyond the door, but I saw Mr.\nJamieson's face change and heard him mutter something, then he bolted\ndown the stairs, three at a time.  When my knees had stopped shaking, I\nmoved forward, slowly, nervously, until I had a partial view of what\nwas beyond the door.  It seemed at first to be a closet, empty.  Then I\nwent close and examined it, to stop with a shudder.  Where the floor\nshould have been was black void and darkness, from which came the\nindescribable, damp smell of the cellars.\n\nMr. Jamieson had locked somebody in the clothes chute.  As I leaned\nover I fancied I heard a groan--or was it the wind?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nA SPRAINED ANKLE\n\nI was panic-stricken.  As I ran along the corridor I was confident that\nthe mysterious intruder and probable murderer had been found, and that\nhe lay dead or dying at the foot of the chute.  I got down the\nstaircase somehow, and through the kitchen to the basement stairs.  Mr.\nJamieson had been before me, and the door stood open.  Liddy was\nstanding in the middle of the kitchen, holding a frying-pan by the\nhandle as a weapon.\n\n\"Don't go down there,\" she yelled, when she saw me moving toward the\nbasement stairs.  \"Don't you do it, Miss Rachel.  That Jamieson's down\nthere now.  There's only trouble comes of hunting ghosts; they lead you\ninto bottomless pits and things like that. Oh, Miss Rachel, don't--\" as\nI tried to get past her.\n\nShe was interrupted by Mr. Jamieson's reappearance.  He ran up the\nstairs two at a time, and his face was flushed and furious.\n\n\"The whole place is locked,\" he said angrily.  \"Where's the laundry key\nkept?\"\n\n\"It's kept in the door,\" Liddy snapped.  \"That whole end of the cellar\nis kept locked, so nobody can get at the clothes, and then the key's\nleft in the door? so that unless a thief was as blind as--as some\ndetectives, he could walk right in.\"\n\n\"Liddy,\" I said sharply, \"come down with us and turn on all the lights.\"\n\nShe offered her resignation, as usual, on the spot, but I took her by\nthe arm, and she came along finally.  She switched on all the lights\nand pointed to a door just ahead.\n\n\"That's the door,\" she said sulkily.  \"The key's in it.\"\n\nBut the key was not in it.  Mr. Jamieson shook it, but it was a heavy\ndoor, well locked.  And then he stooped and began punching around the\nkeyhole with the end of a lead-pencil.  When he stood up his face was\nexultant.\n\n\"It's locked on the inside,\" he said in a low tone.  \"There is somebody\nin there.\"\n\n\"Lord have mercy!\" gasped Liddy, and turned to run.\n\n\"Liddy,\" I called, \"go through the house at once and see who is\nmissing, or if any one is.  We'll have to clear this thing at once.\nMr. Jamieson, if you will watch here I will go to the lodge and find\nWarner.  Thomas would be of no use.  Together you may be able to force\nthe door.\"\n\n\"A good idea,\" he assented.  \"But--there are windows, of course, and\nthere is nothing to prevent whoever is in there from getting out that\nway.\"\n\n\"Then lock the door at the top of the basement stairs,\" I suggested,\n\"and patrol the house from the outside.\"\n\nWe agreed to this, and I had a feeling that the mystery of Sunnyside\nwas about to be solved.  I ran down the steps and along the drive.\nJust at the corner I ran full tilt into somebody who seemed to be as\nmuch alarmed as I was.  It was not until I had recoiled a step or two\nthat I recognized Gertrude, and she me.\n\n\"Good gracious, Aunt Ray,\" she exclaimed, \"what is the matter?\"\n\n\"There's somebody locked in the laundry,\" I panted.  \"That\nis--unless--you didn't see any one crossing the lawn or skulking around\nthe house, did you?\"\n\n\"I think we have mystery on the brain,\" Gertrude said wearily. \"No, I\nhaven't seen any one, except old Thomas, who looked for all the world\nas if he had been ransacking the pantry.  What have you locked in the\nlaundry?\"\n\n\"I can't wait to explain,\" I replied.  \"I must get Warner from the\nlodge.  If you came out for air, you'd better put on your overshoes.\"\nAnd then I noticed that Gertrude was limping--not much, but\nsufficiently to make her progress very slow, and seemingly painful.\n\n\"You have hurt yourself,\" I said sharply.\n\n\"I fell over the carriage block,\" she explained.  \"I thought perhaps I\nmight see Halsey coming home.  He--he ought to be here.\"\n\nI hurried on down the drive.  The lodge was some distance from the\nhouse, in a grove of trees where the drive met the county road.  There\nwere two white stone pillars to mark the entrance, but the iron gates,\nonce closed and tended by the lodge-keeper, now stood permanently open.\nThe day of the motor-car had come; no one had time for closed gates and\nlodge-keepers.  The lodge at Sunnyside was merely a sort of\nsupplementary servants' quarters: it was as convenient in its\nappointments as the big house and infinitely more cozy.\n\nAs I went down the drive, my thoughts were busy.  Who would it be that\nMr. Jamieson had trapped in the cellar?  Would we find a body or some\none badly injured?  Scarcely either.  Whoever had fallen had been able\nto lock the laundry door on the inside.  If the fugitive had come from\noutside the house, how did he get in? If it was some member of the\nhousehold, who could it have been? And then--a feeling of horror almost\noverwhelmed me.  Gertrude! Gertrude and her injured ankle!  Gertrude\nfound limping slowly up the drive when I had thought she was in bed!\n\nI tried to put the thought away, but it would not go.  If Gertrude had\nbeen on the circular staircase that night, why had she fled from Mr.\nJamieson?  The idea, puzzling as it was, seemed borne out by this\ncircumstance.  Whoever had taken refuge at the head of the stairs could\nscarcely have been familiar with the house, or with the location of the\nchute.  The mystery seemed to deepen constantly.  What possible\nconnection could there be between Halsey and Gertrude, and the murder\nof Arnold Armstrong? And yet, every way I turned I seemed to find\nsomething that pointed to such a connection.\n\nAt the foot of the drive the road described a long, sloping,\nhorseshoe-shaped curve around the lodge.  There were lights there,\nstreaming cheerfully out on to the trees, and from an upper room came\nwavering shadows, as if some one with a lamp was moving around.  I had\ncome almost silently in my evening slippers, and I had my second\ncollision of the evening on the road just above the house.  I ran full\ninto a man in a long coat, who was standing in the shadow beside the\ndrive, with his back to me, watching the lighted windows.\n\n\"What the hell!\" he ejaculated furiously, and turned around. When he\nsaw me, however, he did not wait for any retort on my part.  He faded\naway--this is not slang; he did--he absolutely disappeared in the dusk\nwithout my getting more than a glimpse of his face.  I had a vague\nimpression of unfamiliar features and of a sort of cap with a visor.\nThen he was gone.\n\nI went to the lodge and rapped.  It required two or three poundings to\nbring Thomas to the door, and he opened it only an inch or so.\n\n\"Where is Warner?\" I asked.\n\n\"I--I think he's in bed, ma'm.\"\n\n\"Get him up,\" I said, \"and for goodness' sake open the door, Thomas.\nI'll wait for Warner.\"\n\n\"It's kind o' close in here, ma'm,\" he said, obeying gingerly, and\ndisclosing a cool and comfortable looking interior.  \"Perhaps you'd\nkeer to set on the porch an' rest yo'self.\"\n\nIt was so evident that Thomas did not want me inside that I went in.\n\n\"Tell Warner he is needed in a hurry,\" I repeated, and turned into the\nlittle sitting-room.  I could hear Thomas going up the stairs, could\nhear him rouse Warner, and the steps of the chauffeur as he hurriedly\ndressed.  But my attention was busy with the room below.\n\nOn the center-table, open, was a sealskin traveling bag.  It was filled\nwith gold-topped bottles and brushes, and it breathed opulence, luxury,\nfemininity from every inch of surface.  How did it get there?  I was\nstill asking myself the question when Warner came running down the\nstairs and into the room.  He was completely but somewhat incongruously\ndressed, and his open, boyish face looked abashed.  He was a country\nboy, absolutely frank and reliable, of fair education and\nintelligence--one of the small army of American youths who turn a\nnatural aptitude for mechanics into the special field of the\nautomobile, and earn good salaries in a congenial occupation.\n\n\"What is it, Miss Innes?\" he asked anxiously.\n\n\"There is some one locked in the laundry,\" I replied.  \"Mr. Jamieson\nwants you to help him break the lock.  Warner, whose bag is this?\"\n\nHe was in the doorway by this time, and he pretended not to hear.\n\n\"Warner,\" I called, \"come back here.  Whose bag is this?\"\n\nHe stopped then, but he did not turn around.\n\n\"It's--it belongs to Thomas,\" he said, and fled up the drive.\n\nTo Thomas!  A London bag with mirrors and cosmetic jars of which Thomas\ncould not even have guessed the use!  However, I put the bag in the\nback of my mind, which was fast becoming stored with anomalous and\napparently irreconcilable facts, and followed Warner to the house.\n\nLiddy had come back to the kitchen: the door to the basement stairs was\ndouble-barred, and had a table pushed against it; and beside her on the\ntable was most of the kitchen paraphernalia.\n\n\"Did you see if there was any one missing in the house?\" I asked,\nignoring the array of sauce-pans rolling-pins, and the poker of the\nrange.\n\n\"Rosie is missing,\" Liddy said with unction.  She had objected to\nRosie, the parlor maid, from the start.  \"Mrs. Watson went into her\nroom, and found she had gone without her hat.  People that trust\nthemselves a dozen miles from the city, in strange houses, with\nservants they don't know, needn't be surprised if they wake up some\nmorning and find their throats cut.\"\n\nAfter which carefully veiled sarcasm Liddy relapsed into gloom. Warner\ncame in then with a handful of small tools, and Mr. Jamieson went with\nhim to the basement.  Oddly enough, I was not alarmed.  With all my\nheart I wished for Halsey, but I was not frightened.  At the door he\nwas to force, Warner put down his tools and looked at it.  Then he\nturned the handle.  Without the slightest difficulty the door opened,\nrevealing the blackness of the drying-room beyond!\n\nMr. Jamieson gave an exclamation of disgust.\n\n\"Gone!\" he said.  \"Confound such careless work!  I might have known.\"\n\nIt was true enough.  We got the lights on finally and looked all\nthrough the three rooms that constituted this wing of the basement.\nEverything was quiet and empty.  An explanation of how the fugitive had\nescaped injury was found in a heaped-up basket of clothes under the\nchute.  The basket had been overturned, but that was all.  Mr. Jamieson\nexamined the windows: one was unlocked, and offered an easy escape.\nThe window or the door? Which way had the fugitive escaped?  The door\nseemed most probable, and I hoped it had been so.  I could not have\nborne, just then, to think that it was my poor Gertrude we had been\nhounding through the darkness, and yet--I had met Gertrude not far from\nthat very window.\n\nI went up-stairs at last, tired and depressed.  Mrs. Watson and Liddy\nwere making tea in the kitchen.  In certain walks of life the tea-pot\nis the refuge in times of stress, trouble or sickness: they give tea to\nthe dying and they put it in the baby's nursing bottle.  Mrs. Watson\nwas fixing a tray to be sent in to me, and when I asked her about Rosie\nshe confirmed her absence.\n\n\"She's not here,\" she said; \"but I would not think much of that, Miss\nInnes.  Rosie is a pretty young girl, and perhaps she has a sweetheart.\nIt will be a good thing if she has.  The maids stay much better when\nthey have something like that to hold them here.\"\n\nGertrude had gone back to her room, and while I was drinking my cup of\nhot tea, Mr. Jamieson came in.\n\n\"We might take up the conversation where we left off an hour and a half\nago,\" he said.  \"But before we go on, I want to say this: The person\nwho escaped from the laundry was a woman with a foot of moderate size\nand well arched.  She wore nothing but a stocking on her right foot,\nand, in spite of the unlocked door, she escaped by the window.\"\n\nAnd again I thought of Gertrude's sprained ankle.  Was it the right or\nthe left?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE OTHER HALF OF THE LINE\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" the detective began, \"what is your opinion of the figure\nyou saw on the east veranda the night you and your maid were in the\nhouse alone?\"\n\n\"It was a woman,\" I said positively.\n\n\"And yet your maid affirms with equal positiveness that it was a man.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I broke in.  \"Liddy had her eyes shut--she always shuts\nthem when she's frightened.\"\n\n\"And you never thought then that the intruder who came later that night\nmight be a woman--the woman, in fact, whom you saw on the veranda?\"\n\n\"I had reasons for thinking it was a man,\" I said remembering the pearl\ncuff-link.\n\n\"Now we are getting down to business.  WHAT were your reasons for\nthinking that?\"\n\nI hesitated.\n\n\"If you have any reason for believing that your midnight guest was Mr.\nArmstrong, other than his visit here the next night, you ought to tell\nme, Miss Innes.  We can take nothing for granted. If, for instance, the\nintruder who dropped the bar and scratched the staircase--you see, I\nknow about that--if this visitor was a woman, why should not the same\nwoman have come back the following night, met Mr. Armstrong on the\ncircular staircase, and in alarm shot him?\"\n\n\"It was a man,\" I reiterated.  And then, because I could think of no\nother reason for my statement, I told him about the pearl cuff-link.\nHe was intensely interested.\n\n\"Will you give me the link,\" he said, when I finished, \"or, at least,\nlet me see it?  I consider it a most important clue.\"\n\n\"Won't the description do?\"\n\n\"Not as well as the original.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm very sorry,\" I said, as calmly as I could, \"I--the thing is\nlost.  It--it must have fallen out of a box on my dressing-table.\"\n\nWhatever he thought of my explanation, and I knew he doubted it, he\nmade no sign.  He asked me to describe the link accurately, and I did\nso, while he glanced at a list he took from his pocket.\n\n\"One set monogram cuff-links,\" he read, \"one set plain pearl links, one\nset cuff-links, woman's head set with diamonds and emeralds.  There is\nno mention of such a link as you describe, and yet, if your theory is\nright, Mr. Armstrong must have taken back in his cuffs one complete\ncuff-link, and a half, perhaps, of the other.\"\n\nThe idea was new to me.  If it had not been the murdered man who had\nentered the house that night, who had it been?\n\n\"There are a number of strange things connected with this case,\" the\ndetective went on.  \"Miss Gertrude Innes testified that she heard some\none fumbling with the lock, that the door opened, and that almost\nimmediately the shot was fired.  Now, Miss Innes, here is the strange\npart of that.  Mr. Armstrong had no key with him.  There was no key in\nthe lock, or on the floor.  In other words, the evidence points\nabsolutely to this:  Mr. Armstrong was admitted to the house from\nwithin.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" I broke in.  \"Mr. Jamieson, do you know what your\nwords imply?  Do you know that you are practically accusing Gertrude\nInnes of admitting that man?\"\n\n\"Not quite that,\" he said, with his friendly smile.  \"In fact, Miss\nInnes, I am quite certain she did not.  But as long as I learn only\nparts of the truth, from both you and her, what can I do?  I know you\npicked up something in the flower bed: you refuse to tell me what it\nwas.  I know Miss Gertrude went back to the billiard-room to get\nsomething, she refuses to say what.  You suspect what happened to the\ncuff-link, but you won't tell me. So far, all I am sure of is this:  I\ndo not believe Arnold Armstrong was the midnight visitor who so alarmed\nyou by dropping--shall we say, a golf-stick?  And I believe that when\nhe did come he was admitted by some one in the house.  Who knows--it\nmay have been--Liddy!\"\n\nI stirred my tea angrily.\n\n\"I have always heard,\" I said dryly, \"that undertakers' assistants are\njovial young men.  A man's sense of humor seems to be in inverse\nproportion to the gravity of his profession.\"\n\n\"A man's sense of humor is a barbarous and a cruel thing, Miss Innes,\"\nhe admitted.  \"It is to the feminine as the hug of a bear is to the\nscratch of--well;--anything with claws.  Is that you, Thomas?  Come in.\"\n\nThomas Johnson stood in the doorway.  He looked alarmed and\napprehensive, and suddenly I remembered the sealskin dressing-bag in\nthe lodge.  Thomas came just inside the door and stood with his head\ndrooping, his eyes, under their shaggy gray brows, fixed on Mr.\nJamieson.\n\n\"Thomas,\" said the detective, not unkindly, \"I sent for you to tell us\nwhat you told Sam Bohannon at the club, the day before Mr. Arnold was\nfound here, dead.  Let me see.  You came here Friday night to see Miss\nInnes, didn't you?  And came to work here Saturday morning?\"\n\nFor some unexplained reason Thomas looked relieved.\n\n\"Yas, sah,\" he said.  \"You see it were like this:  When Mistah\nArmstrong and the fam'ly went away, Mis' Watson an' me, we was lef' in\ncharge till the place was rented.  Mis' Watson, she've bin here a good\nwhile, an' she warn' skeery.  So she slep' in the house.  I'd bin\nhavin' tokens--I tol' Mis' Innes some of 'em--an' I slep' in the lodge.\nThen one day Mis' Watson, she came to me an' she sez, sez she, 'Thomas,\nyou'll hev to sleep up in the big house.  I'm too nervous to do it any\nmore.'  But I jes' reckon to myself that ef it's too skeery fer her,\nit's too skeery fer me.  We had it, then, sho' nuff, and it ended up\nwith Mis' Watson stayin' in the lodge nights an' me lookin' fer work at\nde club.\"\n\n\"Did Mrs. Watson say that anything had happened to alarm her?\"\n\n\"No, sah.  She was jes' natchally skeered.  Well, that was all, far's I\nknow, until the night I come over to see Mis' Innes.  I come across the\nvalley, along the path from the club-house, and I goes home that way.\nDown in the creek bottom I almost run into a man.  He wuz standin' with\nhis back to me, an' he was workin' with one of these yere electric\nlight things that fit in yer pocket.  He was havin' trouble--one minute\nit'd flash out, an' the nex' it'd be gone.  I hed a view of 'is white\ndress shirt an' tie, as I passed.  I didn't see his face.  But I know\nit warn't Mr. Arnold.  It was a taller man than Mr. Arnold.  Beside\nthat, Mr. Arnold was playin' cards when I got to the club-house, same's\nhe'd been doin' all day.\"\n\n\"And the next morning you came back along the path,\" pursued Mr.\nJamieson relentlessly.\n\n\"The nex' mornin' I come back along the path an' down where I dun see\nthe man night befoh, I picked up this here.\"  The old man held out a\ntiny object and Mr. Jamieson took it.  Then he held it on his extended\npalm for me to see.  It was the other half of the pearl cuff-link!\n\nBut Mr. Jamieson was not quite through questioning him.\n\n\"And so you showed it to Sam, at the club, and asked him if he knew any\none who owned such a link, and Sam said--what?\"\n\n\"Wal, Sam, he 'lowed he'd seen such a pair of cuff-buttons in a shirt\nbelongin' to Mr. Bailey--Mr. Jack Bailey, sah.\"\n\n\"I'll keep this link, Thomas, for a while,\" the detective said. \"That's\nall I wanted to know.  Good night.\"\n\nAs Thomas shuffled out, Mr. Jamieson watched me sharply.\n\n\"You see, Miss Innes,\" he said, \"Mr. Bailey insists on mixing himself\nwith this thing.  If Mr. Bailey came here that Friday night expecting\nto meet Arnold Armstrong, and missed him--if, as I say, he had done\nthis, might he not, seeing him enter the following night, have struck\nhim down, as he had intended before?\"\n\n\"But the motive?\" I gasped.\n\n\"There could be motive proved, I think.  Arnold Armstrong and John\nBailey have been enemies since the latter, as cashier of the Traders'\nBank, brought Arnold almost into the clutches of the law.  Also, you\nforget that both men have been paying attention to Miss Gertrude.\nBailey's flight looks bad, too.\"\n\n\"And you think Halsey helped him to escape?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly.  Why, what could it be but flight?  Miss Innes, let me\nreconstruct that evening, as I see it.  Bailey and Armstrong had\nquarreled at the club.  I learned this to-day.  Your nephew brought\nBailey over.  Prompted by jealous, insane fury, Armstrong followed,\ncoming across by the path.  He entered the billiard-room wing--perhaps\nrapping, and being admitted by your nephew. Just inside he was shot, by\nsome one on the circular staircase. The shot fired, your nephew and\nBailey left the house at once, going toward the automobile house.  They\nleft by the lower road, which prevented them being heard, and when you\nand Miss Gertrude got down-stairs everything was quiet.\"\n\n\"But--Gertrude's story,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Miss Gertrude only brought forward her explanation the following\nmorning.  I do not believe it, Miss Innes.  It is the story of a loving\nand ingenious woman.\"\n\n\"And--this thing to-night?\"\n\n\"May upset my whole view of the case.  We must give the benefit of\nevery doubt, after all.  We may, for instance, come back to the figure\non the porch: if it was a woman you saw that night through the window,\nwe might start with other premises.  Or Mr. Innes' explanation may turn\nus in a new direction.  It is possible that he shot Arnold Armstrong as\na burglar and then fled, frightened at what he had done.  In any case,\nhowever, I feel confident that the body was here when he left.  Mr.\nArmstrong left the club ostensibly for a moonlight saunter, about half\nafter eleven o'clock.  It was three when the shot was fired.\"\n\nI leaned back bewildered.  It seemed to me that the evening had been\nfull of significant happenings, had I only held the key. Had Gertrude\nbeen the fugitive in the clothes chute?  Who was the man on the drive\nnear the lodge, and whose gold-mounted dressing-bag had I seen in the\nlodge sitting-room?\n\nIt was late when Mr. Jamieson finally got up to go.  I went with him to\nthe door, and together we stood looking out over the valley.  Below lay\nthe village of Casanova, with its Old World houses, its blossoming\ntrees and its peace.  Above on the hill across the valley were the\nlights of the Greenwood Club.  It was even possible to see the curving\nrow of parallel lights that marked the carriage road.  Rumors that I\nhad heard about the club came back--of drinking, of high play, and\nonce, a year ago, of a suicide under those very lights.\n\nMr. Jamieson left, taking a short cut to the village, and I still stood\nthere.  It must have been after eleven, and the monotonous tick of the\nbig clock on the stairs behind me was the only sound.\n\nThen I was conscious that some one was running up the drive.  In a\nminute a woman darted into the area of light made by the open door, and\ncaught me by the arm.  It was Rosie--Rosie in a state of collapse from\nterror, and, not the least important, clutching one of my Coalport\nplates and a silver spoon.\n\nShe stood staring into the darkness behind, still holding the plate.  I\ngot her into the house and secured the plate; then I stood and looked\ndown at her where she crouched tremblingly against the doorway.\n\n\"Well,\" I asked, \"didn't your young man enjoy his meal?\"\n\nShe couldn't speak.  She looked at the spoon she still held--I wasn't\nso anxious about it: thank Heaven, it wouldn't chip--and then she\nstared at me.\n\n\"I appreciate your desire to have everything nice for him,\" I went on,\n\"but the next time, you might take the Limoges china It's more easily\nduplicated and less expensive.\"\n\n\"I haven't a young man--not here.\"  She had got her breath now, as I\nhad guessed she would.  \"I--I have been chased by a thief, Miss Innes.\"\n\n\"Did he chase you out of the house and back again?\" I asked.\n\nThen Rosie began to cry--not silently, but noisily, hysterically.\n\nI stopped her by giving her a good shake.\n\n\"What in the world is the matter with you?\" I snapped.  \"Has the day of\ngood common sense gone by!  Sit up and tell me the whole thing.\"  Rosie\nsat up then, and sniffled.\n\n\"I was coming up the drive--\" she began.\n\n\"You must start with when you went DOWN the drive, with my dishes and\nmy silver,\" I interrupted, but, seeing more signs of hysteria, I gave\nin.  \"Very well.  You were coming up the drive--\"\n\n\"I had a basket of--of silver and dishes on my arm and I was carrying\nthe plate, because--because I was afraid I'd break it. Part-way up the\nroad a man stepped out of the bushes, and held his arm like this,\nspread out, so I couldn't get past.  He said--he said--'Not so fast,\nyoung lady; I want you to let me see what's in that basket.'\"\n\nShe got up in her excitement and took hold of my arm.\n\n\"It was like this, Miss Innes,\" she said, \"and say you was the man.\nWhen he said that, I screamed and ducked under his arm like this.  He\ncaught at the basket and I dropped it.  I ran as fast as I could, and\nhe came after as far as the trees.  Then he stopped.  Oh, Miss Innes,\nit must have been the man that killed that Mr. Armstrong!\"\n\n\"Don't be foolish,\" I said.  \"Whoever killed Mr. Armstrong would put as\nmuch space between himself and this house as he could.  Go up to bed\nnow; and mind, if I hear of this story being repeated to the other\nmaids, I shall deduct from your wages for every broken dish I find in\nthe drive.\"\n\nI listened to Rosie as she went up-stairs, running past the shadowy\nplaces and slamming her door.  Then I sat down and looked at the\nCoalport plate and the silver spoon.  I had brought my own china and\nsilver, and, from all appearances, I would have little enough to take\nback.  But though I might jeer at Rosie as much as I wished, the fact\nremained that some one had been on the drive that night who had no\nbusiness there.  Although neither had Rosie, for that matter.\n\nI could fancy Liddy's face when she missed the extra pieces of\nchina--she had opposed Rosie from the start.  If Liddy once finds a\nprophecy fulfilled, especially an unpleasant one, she never allows me\nto forget it.  It seemed to me that it was absurd to leave that china\ndotted along the road for her to spy the next morning; so with a sudden\nresolution, I opened the door again and stepped out into the darkness.\nAs the door closed behind me I half regretted my impulse; then I shut\nmy teeth and went on.\n\nI have never been a nervous woman, as I said before.  Moreover, a\nminute or two in the darkness enabled me to see things fairly well.\nBeulah gave me rather a start by rubbing unexpectedly against my feet;\nthen we two, side by side, went down the drive.\n\nThere were no fragments of china, but where the grove began I picked up\na silver spoon.  So far Rosie's story was borne out:  I began to wonder\nif it were not indiscreet, to say the least, this midnight prowling in\na neighborhood with such a deservedly bad reputation.  Then I saw\nsomething gleaming, which proved to be the handle of a cup, and a step\nor two farther on I found a V-shaped bit of a plate.  But the most\nsurprising thing of all was to find the basket sitting comfortably\nbeside the road, with the rest of the broken crockery piled neatly\nwithin, and a handful of small silver, spoon, forks, and the like, on\ntop!  I could only stand and stare.  Then Rosie's story was true.  But\nwhere had Rosie carried her basket?  And why had the thief, if he were\na thief, picked up the broken china out of the road and left it, with\nhis booty?\n\nIt was with my nearest approach to a nervous collapse that I heard the\nfamiliar throbbing of an automobile engine.  As it came closer I\nrecognized the outline of the Dragon Fly, and knew that Halsey had come\nback.\n\nStrange enough it must have seemed to Halsey, too, to come across me in\nthe middle of the night, with the skirt of my gray silk gown over my\nshoulders to keep off the dew, holding a red and green basket under one\narm and a black cat under the other.  What with relief and joy, I began\nto cry, right there, and very nearly wiped my eyes on Beulah in the\nexcitement.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nJUST LIKE A GIRL\n\n\"Aunt Ray!\" Halsey said from the gloom behind the lamps.  \"What in the\nworld are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Taking a walk,\" I said, trying to be composed.  I don't think the\nanswer struck either of us as being ridiculous at the time. \"Oh,\nHalsey, where have you been?\"\n\n\"Let me take you up to the house.\"  He was in the road, and had Beulah\nand the basket out of my arms in a moment.  I could see the car plainly\nnow, and Warner was at the wheel--Warner in an ulster and a pair of\nslippers, over Heaven knows what.  Jack Bailey was not there.  I got\nin, and we went slowly and painfully up to the house.\n\nWe did not talk.  What we had to say was too important to commence\nthere, and, besides, it took all kinds of coaxing from both men to get\nthe Dragon Fly up the last grade.  Only when we had closed the front\ndoor and stood facing each other in the hall, did Halsey say anything.\nHe slipped his strong young arm around my shoulders and turned me so I\nfaced the light.\n\n\"Poor Aunt Ray!\" he said gently.  And I nearly wept again.  \"I--I must\nsee Gertrude, too; we will have a three-cornered talk.\"\n\nAnd then Gertrude herself came down the stairs.  She had not been to\nbed, evidently: she still wore the white negligee she had worn earlier\nin the evening, and she limped somewhat.  During her slow progress down\nthe stairs I had time to notice one thing:  Mr. Jamieson had said the\nwoman who escaped from the cellar had worn no shoe on her right foot.\nGertrude's right ankle was the one she had sprained!\n\nThe meeting between brother and sister was tense, but without tears.\nHalsey kissed her tenderly, and I noticed evidences of strain and\nanxiety in both young faces.\n\n\"Is everything--right?\" she asked.\n\n\"Right as can be,\" with forced cheerfulness.\n\nI lighted the living-room and we went in there.  Only a half-hour\nbefore I had sat with Mr. Jamieson in that very room, listening while\nhe overtly accused both Gertrude and Halsey of at least a knowledge of\nthe death of Arnold Armstrong.  Now Halsey was here to speak for\nhimself:  I should learn everything that had puzzled me.\n\n\"I saw it in the paper to-night for the first time,\" he was saying.\n\"It knocked me dumb.  When I think of this houseful of women, and a\nthing like that occurring!\"\n\nGertrude's face was still set and white.  \"That isn't all, Halsey,\" she\nsaid.  \"You and--and Jack left almost at the time it happened.  The\ndetective here thinks that you--that we--know something about it.\"\n\n\"The devil he does!\" Halsey's eyes were fairly starting from his head.\n\"I beg your pardon, Aunt Ray, but--the fellow's a lunatic.\"\n\n\"Tell me everything, won't you, Halsey?\" I begged.  \"Tell me where you\nwent that night, or rather morning, and why you went as you did.  This\nhas been a terrible forty-eight hours for all of us.\"\n\nHe stood staring at me, and I could see the horror of the situation\ndawning in his face.\n\n\"I can't tell you where I went, Aunt Ray,\" he said, after a moment.\n\"As to why, you will learn that soon enough.  But Gertrude knows that\nJack and I left the house before this thing--this horrible\nmurder--occurred.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jamieson does not believe me,\" Gertrude said drearily. \"Halsey, if\nthe worst comes, if they should arrest you, you must--tell.\"\n\n\"I shall tell nothing,\" he said with a new sternness in his voice.\n\"Aunt Ray, it was necessary for Jack and me to leave that night.  I can\nnot tell you why--just yet.  As to where we went, if I have to depend\non that as an alibi, I shall not tell.  The whole thing is an\nabsurdity, a trumped-up charge that can not possibly be serious.\"\n\n\"Has Mr. Bailey gone back to the city,\" I demanded, \"or to the club?\"\n\n\"Neither,\" defiantly; \"at the present moment I do not know where he is.\"\n\n\"Halsey,\" I asked gravely, leaning forward, \"have you the slightest\nsuspicion who killed Arnold Armstrong?  The police think he was\nadmitted from within, and that he was shot down from above, by someone\non the circular staircase.\"\n\n\"I know nothing of it,\" he maintained; but I fancied I caught a sudden\nglance at Gertrude, a flash of something that died as it came.\n\nAs quietly, as calmly as I could, I went over the whole story, from the\nnight Liddy and I had been alone up to the strange experience of Rosie\nand her pursuer.  The basket still stood on the table, a mute witness\nto this last mystifying occurrence.\n\n\"There is something else,\" I said hesitatingly, at the last. \"Halsey, I\nhave never told this even to Gertrude, but the morning after the crime,\nI found, in a tulip bed, a revolver.  It--it was yours, Halsey.\"\n\nFor an appreciable moment Halsey stared at me.  Then he turned to\nGertrude.\n\n\"My revolver, Trude!\" he exclaimed.  \"Why, Jack took my revolver with\nhim, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Oh, for Heaven's sake don't say that,\" I implored.  \"The detective\nthinks possibly Jack Bailey came back, and--and the thing happened\nthen.\"\n\n\"He didn't come back,\" Halsey said sternly.  \"Gertrude, when you\nbrought down a revolver that night for Jack to take with him, what one\ndid you bring?  Mine?\"\n\nGertrude was defiant now.\n\n\"No.  Yours was loaded, and I was afraid of what Jack might do.  I gave\nhim one I have had for a year or two.  It was empty.\"\n\nHalsey threw up both hands despairingly.\n\n\"If that isn't like a girl!\" he said.  \"Why didn't you do what I asked\nyou to, Gertrude?  You send Bailey off with an empty gun, and throw\nmine in a tulip bed, of all places on earth!  Mine was a thirty-eight\ncaliber.  The inquest will show, of course, that the bullet that killed\nArmstrong was a thirty-eight.  Then where shall I be?\"\n\n\"You forget,\" I broke in, \"that I have the revolver, and that no one\nknows about it.\"\n\n\nBut Gertrude had risen angrily.\n\n\"I can not stand it; it is always with me,\" she cried.  \"Halsey, I did\nnot throw your revolver into the tulip bed. I--think--you--did\nit--yourself!\"\n\nThey stared at each other across the big library table, with young eyes\nall at once hard, suspicious.  And then Gertrude held out both hands to\nhim appealingly.\n\n\"We must not,\" she said brokenly.  \"Just now, with so much at stake,\nit--is shameful.  I know you are as ignorant as I am. Make me believe\nit, Halsey.\"\n\nHalsey soothed her as best he could, and the breach seemed healed.  But\nlong after I went to bed he sat down-stairs in the living-room alone,\nand I knew he was going over the case as he had learned it.  Some\nthings were clear to him that were dark to me.  He knew, and Gertrude,\ntoo, why Jack Bailey and he had gone away that night, as they did.  He\nknew where they had been for the last forty-eight hours, and why Jack\nBailey had not returned with him.  It seemed to me that without fuller\nconfidence from both the children--they are always children to me--I\nshould never be able to learn anything.\n\nAs I was finally getting ready for bed, Halsey came up-stairs and\nknocked at my door.  When I had got into a negligee--I used to say\nwrapper before Gertrude came back from school--I let him in. He stood\nin the doorway a moment, and then he went into agonies of silent mirth.\nI sat down on the side of the bed and waited in severe silence for him\nto stop, but he only seemed to grow worse.\n\nWhen he had recovered he took me by the elbow and pulled me in front of\nthe mirror.\n\n\"'How to be beautiful,'\" he quoted.  \"'Advice to maids and matrons,' by\nBeatrice Fairfax!\"  And then I saw myself.  I had neglected to remove\nmy wrinkle eradicators, and I presume my appearance was odd.  I believe\nthat it is a woman's duty to care for her looks, but it is much like\ntelling a necessary falsehood--one must not be found out.  By the time\nI got them off Halsey was serious again, and I listened to his story.\n\n\"Aunt Ray,\" he began, extinguishing his cigarette on the back of my\nivory hair-brush, \"I would give a lot to tell you the whole thing.\nBut--I can't, for a day or so, anyhow.  But one thing I might have told\nyou a long time ago.  If you had known it, you would not have suspected\nme for a moment of--of having anything to do with the attack on Arnold\nArmstrong.  Goodness knows what I might do to a fellow like that, if\nthere was enough provocation, and I had a gun in my hand--under\nordinary circumstances.  But--I care a great deal about Louise\nArmstrong, Aunt Ray.  I hope to marry her some day.  Is it likely I\nwould kill her brother?\"\n\n\"Her stepbrother,\" I corrected.  \"No, of course, it isn't likely, or\npossible.  Why didn't you tell me, Halsey?\"\n\n\"Well, there were two reasons,\" he said slowly.\n\n\"One was that you had a girl already picked out for me--\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" I broke in, and felt myself growing red.  I had, indeed,\none of the--but no matter.\n\n\"And the second reason,\" he pursued, \"was that the Armstrongs would\nhave none of me.\"\n\nI sat bolt upright at that and gasped.\n\n\"The Armstrongs!\" I repeated.  \"With old Peter Armstrong driving a\nstage across the mountains while your grandfather was war governor--\"\n\n\"Well, of course, the war governor's dead, and out of the matrimonial\nmarket,\" Halsey interrupted.  \"And the present Innes admits himself he\nisn't good enough for--for Louise.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" I said despairingly, \"and, of course, you are taken at your\nown valuation.  The Inneses are not always so self-depreciatory.\"\n\n\"Not always, no,\" he said, looking at me with his boyish smile.\n\"Fortunately, Louise doesn't agree with her family.  She's willing to\ntake me, war governor or no, provided her mother consents.  She isn't\noverly-fond of her stepfather, but she adores her mother.  And now,\ncan't you see where this thing puts me?  Down and out, with all of\nthem.\"\n\n\"But the whole thing is absurd,\" I argued.  \"And besides, Gertrude's\nsworn statement that you left before Arnold Armstrong came would clear\nyou at once.\"\n\nHalsey got up and began to pace the room, and the air of cheerfulness\ndropped like a mask.\n\n\"She can't swear it,\" he said finally.  \"Gertrude's story was true as\nfar as it went, but she didn't tell everything.  Arnold Armstrong came\nhere at two-thirty--came into the billiard-room and left in five\nminutes.  He came to bring--something.\"\n\n\"Halsey,\" I cried, \"you MUST tell me the whole truth.  Every time I see\na way for you to escape you block it yourself with this wall of\nmystery.  What did he bring?\"\n\n\"A telegram--for Bailey,\" he said.  \"It came by special messenger from\ntown, and was--most important.  Bailey had started for here, and the\nmessenger had gone back to the city.  The steward gave it to Arnold,\nwho had been drinking all day and couldn't sleep, and was going for a\nstroll in the direction of Sunnyside.\"\n\n\"And he brought it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What was in the telegram?\"\n\n\"I can tell you--as soon as certain things are made public.  It is only\na matter of days now,\" gloomily.\n\n\"And Gertrude's story of a telephone message?\"\n\n\"Poor Trude!\" he half whispered.  \"Poor loyal little girl! Aunt Ray,\nthere was no such message.  No doubt your detective already knows that\nand discredits all Gertrude told him.\"\n\n\"And when she went back, it was to get--the telegram?\"\n\n\"Probably,\" Halsey said slowly.  \"When you get to thinking about it,\nAunt Ray, it looks bad for all three of us, doesn't it?  And yet--I\nwill take my oath none of us even inadvertently killed that poor devil.\"\n\nI looked at the closed door into Gertrude's dressing-room, and lowered\nmy voice.\n\n\"The same horrible thought keeps recurring to me,\" I whispered.\n\"Halsey, Gertrude probably had your revolver: she must have examined\nit, anyhow, that night.  After you--and Jack had gone, what if that\nruffian came back, and she--and she--\"\n\nI couldn't finish.  Halsey stood looking at me with shut lips.\n\n\"She might have heard him fumbling at the door he had no key, the\npolice say--and thinking it was you, or Jack, she admitted him.  When\nshe saw her mistake she ran up the stairs, a step or two, and turning,\nlike an animal at bay, she fired.\"\n\nHalsey had his hand over my lips before I finished, and in that\nposition we stared each at the other, our stricken glances crossing.\n\n\"The revolver--my revolver--thrown into the tulip bed!\" he muttered to\nhimself.  \"Thrown perhaps from an upper window: you say it was buried\ndeep.  Her prostration ever since, her--Aunt Ray, you don't think it\nwas Gertrude who fell down the clothes chute?\"\n\nI could only nod my head in a hopeless affirmative.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nTHE TRADERS BANK\n\nThe morning after Halsey's return was Tuesday.  Arnold Armstrong had\nbeen found dead at the foot of the circular staircase at three o'clock\non Sunday morning.  The funeral services were to be held on Tuesday,\nand the interment of the body was to be deferred until the Armstrongs\narrived from California.  No one, I think, was very sorry that Arnold\nArmstrong was dead, but the manner of his death aroused some sympathy\nand an enormous amount of curiosity.  Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh, a cousin,\ntook charge of the arrangements, and everything, I believe, was as\nquiet as possible.  I gave Thomas Johnson and Mrs. Watson permission to\ngo into town to pay their last respects to the dead man, but for some\nreason they did not care to go.\n\nHalsey spent part of the day with Mr. Jamieson, but he said nothing of\nwhat happened.  He looked grave and anxious, and he had a long\nconversation with Gertrude late in the afternoon.\n\nTuesday evening found us quiet, with the quiet that precedes an\nexplosion.  Gertrude and Halsey were both gloomy and distraught, and as\nLiddy had already discovered that some of the china was broken--it is\nimpossible to have any secrets from an old servant--I was not in a\npleasant humor myself.  Warner brought up the afternoon mail and the\nevening papers at seven--I was curious to know what the papers said of\nthe murder.  We had turned away at least a dozen reporters.  But I read\nover the head-line that ran half-way across the top of the Gazette\ntwice before I comprehended it.  Halsey had opened the Chronicle and\nwas staring at it fixedly.\n\n\"The Traders' Bank closes its doors!\" was what I read, and then I put\ndown the paper and looked across the table.\n\n\"Did you know of this?\" I asked Halsey.\n\n\"I expected it.  But not so soon,\" he replied.\n\n\"And you?\" to Gertrude.\n\n\"Jack--told us--something,\" Gertrude said faintly.  \"Oh, Halsey, what\ncan he do now?\"\n\n\"Jack!\" I said scornfully.  \"Your Jack's flight is easy enough to\nexplain now.  And you helped him, both of you, to get away!  You get\nthat from your mother; it isn't an Innes trait. Do you know that every\ndollar you have, both of you, is in that bank?\"\n\nGertrude tried to speak, but Halsey stopped her.\n\n\"That isn't all, Gertrude,\" he said quietly; \"Jack is--under arrest.\"\n\n\"Under arrest!\" Gertrude screamed, and tore the paper out of his hand.\nShe glanced at the heading, then she crumpled the newspaper into a ball\nand flung it to the floor.  While Halsey, looking stricken and white,\nwas trying to smooth it out and read it, Gertrude had dropped her head\non the table and was sobbing stormily.\n\nI have the clipping somewhere, but just now I can remember only the\nessentials.\n\nOn the afternoon before, Monday, while the Traders' Bank was in the\nrush of closing hour, between two and three, Mr. Jacob Trautman,\nPresident of the Pearl Brewing Company, came into the bank to lift a\nloan.  As security for the loan he had deposited some three hundred\nInternational Steamship Company 5's, in total value three hundred\nthousand dollars.  Mr. Trautman went to the loan clerk and, after\ncertain formalities had been gone through, the loan clerk went to the\nvault.  Mr. Trautman, who was a large and genial German, waited for a\ntime, whistling under his breath.  The loan clerk did not come back.\nAfter an interval, Mr. Trautman saw the loan clerk emerge from the\nvault and go to the assistant cashier: the two went hurriedly to the\nvault.  A lapse of another ten minutes, and the assistant cashier came\nout and approached Mr. Trautman.  He was noticeably white and\ntrembling.  Mr. Trautman was told that through an oversight the bonds\nhad been misplaced, and was asked to return the following morning, when\neverything would be made all right.\n\nMr. Trautman, however, was a shrewd business man, and he did not like\nthe appearance of things.  He left the bank apparently satisfied, and\nwithin thirty minutes he had called up three different members of the\nTraders' Board of Directors.  At three-thirty there was a hastily\nconvened board meeting, with some stormy scenes, and late in the\nafternoon a national bank examiner was in possession of the books.  The\nbank had not opened for business on Tuesday.\n\nAt twelve-thirty o'clock the Saturday before, as soon as the business\nof the day was closed, Mr. John Bailey, the cashier of the defunct\nbank, had taken his hat and departed.  During the afternoon he had\ncalled up Mr. Aronson, a member of the board, and said he was ill, and\nmight not be at the bank for a day or two.  As Bailey was highly\nthought of, Mr. Aronson merely expressed a regret.  From that time\nuntil Monday night, when Mr. Bailey had surrendered to the police,\nlittle was known of his movements.  Some time after one on Saturday he\nhad entered the Western Union office at Cherry and White Streets and\nhad sent two telegrams.  He was at the Greenwood Country Club on\nSaturday night, and appeared unlike himself.  It was reported that he\nwould be released under enormous bond, some time that day, Tuesday.\n\nThe article closed by saying that while the officers of the bank\nrefused to talk until the examiner had finished his work, it was known\nthat securities aggregating a million and a quarter were missing.  Then\nthere was a diatribe on the possibility of such an occurrence; on the\nfolly of a one-man bank, and of a Board of Directors that met only to\nlunch together and to listen to a brief report from the cashier, and on\nthe poor policy of a government that arranges a three or four-day\nexamination twice a year.  The mystery, it insinuated, had not been\ncleared by the arrest of the cashier.  Before now minor officials had\nbeen used to cloak the misdeeds of men higher up.  Inseparable as the\nwords \"speculation\" and \"peculation\" have grown to be, John Bailey was\nnot known to be in the stock market.  His only words, after his\nsurrender, had been \"Send for Mr. Armstrong at once.\" The telegraph\nmessage which had finally reached the President of the Traders' Bank,\nin an interior town in California, had been responded to by a telegram\nfrom Doctor Walker, the young physician who was traveling with the\nArmstrong family, saying that Paul Armstrong was very ill and unable to\ntravel.\n\nThat was how things stood that Tuesday evening.  The Traders' Bank had\nsuspended payment, and John Bailey was under arrest, charged with\nwrecking it; Paul Armstrong lay very ill in California, and his only\nson had been murdered two days before. I sat dazed and bewildered.  The\nchildren's money was gone: that was bad enough, though I had plenty, if\nthey would let me share. But Gertrude's grief was beyond any power of\nmine to comfort; the man she had chosen stood accused of a colossal\nembezzlement--and even worse.  For in the instant that I sat there I\nseemed to see the coils closing around John Bailey as the murderer of\nArnold Armstrong.\n\nGertrude lifted her head at last and stared across the table at Halsey.\n\n\"Why did he do it?\" she wailed.  \"Couldn't you stop him, Halsey? It was\nsuicidal to go back!\"\n\nHalsey was looking steadily through the windows of the breakfast-room,\nbut it was evident he saw nothing.\n\n\"It was the only thing he could do, Trude,\" he said at last. \"Aunt Ray,\nwhen I found Jack at the Greenwood Club last Saturday night, he was\nfrantic.  I can not talk until Jack tells me I may, but--he is\nabsolutely innocent of all this, believe me.  I thought, Trude and I\nthought, we were helping him, but it was the wrong way.  He came back.\nIsn't that the act of an innocent man?\"\n\n\"Then why did he leave at all?\" I asked, unconvinced.  \"What innocent\nman would run away from here at three o'clock in the morning?  Doesn't\nit look rather as though he thought it impossible to escape?\"\n\nGertrude rose angrily.  \"You are not even just!\" she flamed. \"You don't\nknow anything about it, and you condemn him!\"\n\n\"I know that we have all lost a great deal of money,\" I said.  \"I shall\nbelieve Mr. Bailey innocent the moment he is shown to be. You profess\nto know the truth, but you can not tell me!  What am I to think?\"\n\nHalsey leaned over and patted my hand.\n\n\"You must take us on faith,\" he said.  \"Jack Bailey hasn't a penny that\ndoesn't belong to him; the guilty man will be known in a day or so.\"\n\n\"I shall believe that when it is proved,\" I said grimly.  \"In the\nmeantime, I take no one on faith.  The Inneses never do.\"\n\nGertrude, who had been standing aloof at a window, turned suddenly.\n\"But when the bonds are offered for sale, Halsey, won't the thief be\ndetected at once?\"\n\nHalsey turned with a superior smile.\n\n\"It wouldn't be done that way,\" he said.  \"They would be taken out of\nthe vault by some one who had access to it, and used as collateral for\na loan in another bank.  It would be possible to realize eighty per\ncent. of their face value.\"\n\n\"In cash?\"\n\n\"In cash.\"\n\n\"But the man who did it--he would be known?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I tell you both, as sure as I stand here, I believe that Paul\nArmstrong looted his own bank.  I believe he has a million at least, as\nthe result, and that he will never come back.  I'm worse than a pauper\nnow.  I can't ask Louise to share nothing a year with me and when I\nthink of this disgrace for her, I'm crazy.\"\n\nThe most ordinary events of life seemed pregnant with possibilities\nthat day, and when Halsey was called to the telephone, I ceased all\npretense at eating.  When he came back from the telephone his face\nshowed that something had occurred. He waited, however, until Thomas\nleft the dining-room: then he told us.\n\n\"Paul Armstrong is dead,\" he announced gravely.  \"He died this morning\nin California.  Whatever he did, he is beyond the law now.\"\n\nGertrude turned pale.\n\n\"And the only man who could have cleared Jack can never do it!\" she\nsaid despairingly.\n\n\"Also,\" I replied coldly, \"Mr. Armstrong is for ever beyond the power\nof defending himself.  When your Jack comes to me, with some two\nhundred thousand dollars in his hands, which is about what you have\nlost, I shall believe him innocent.\"\n\nHalsey threw his cigarette away and turned on me.\n\n\"There you go!\" he exclaimed.  \"If he was the thief, he could return\nthe money, of course.  If he is innocent, he probably hasn't a tenth of\nthat amount in the world.  In his hands! That's like a woman.\"\n\nGertrude, who had been pale and despairing during the early part of the\nconversation, had flushed an indignant red.  She got up and drew\nherself to her slender height, looking down at me with the scorn of the\nyoung and positive.\n\n\"You are the only mother I ever had,\" she said tensely.  \"I have given\nyou all I would have given my mother, had she lived--my love, my trust.\nAnd now, when I need you most, you fail me.  I tell you, John Bailey is\na good man, an honest man.  If you say he is not, you--you--\"\n\n\"Gertrude,\" Halsey broke in sharply.  She dropped beside the table and,\nburying her face in her arms broke into a storm of tears.\n\n\"I love him--love him,\" she sobbed, in a surrender that was totally\nunlike her.  \"Oh, I never thought it would be like this. I can't bear\nit. I can't.\"\n\nHalsey and I stood helpless before the storm.  I would have tried to\ncomfort her, but she had put me away, and there was something aloof in\nher grief, something new and strange.  At last, when her sorrow had\nsubsided to the dry shaking sobs of a tired child, without raising her\nhead she put out one groping hand.\n\n\"Aunt Ray!\" she whispered.  In a moment I was on my knees beside her,\nher arm around my neck, her cheek against my hair.\n\n\"Where am I in this?\" Halsey said suddenly and tried to put his arms\naround us both.  It was a welcome distraction, and Gertrude was soon\nherself again.  The little storm had cleared the air. Nevertheless, my\nopinion remained unchanged.  There was much to be cleared up before I\nwould consent to any renewal of my acquaintance with John Bailey.  And\nHalsey and Gertrude knew it, knowing me.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nHALSEY MAKES A CAPTURE\n\nIt was about half-past eight when we left the dining-room and still\nengrossed with one subject, the failure of the bank and its attendant\nevils Halsey and I went out into the grounds for a stroll Gertrude\nfollowed us shortly.  \"The light was thickening,\" to appropriate\nShakespeare's description of twilight, and once again the tree-toads\nand the crickets were making night throb with their tiny life.  It was\nalmost oppressively lonely, in spite of its beauty, and I felt a\nsickening pang of homesickness for my city at night--for the clatter of\nhorses' feet on cemented paving, for the lights, the voices, the sound\nof children playing.  The country after dark oppresses me.  The stars,\nquite eclipsed in the city by the electric lights, here become\ninsistent, assertive.  Whether I want to or not, I find myself looking\nfor the few I know by name, and feeling ridiculously new and small by\ncontrast--always an unpleasant sensation.\n\nAfter Gertrude joined us, we avoided any further mention of the murder.\nTo Halsey, as to me, there was ever present, I am sure, the thought of\nour conversation of the night before.  As we strolled back and forth\nalong the drive, Mr. Jamieson emerged from the shadow of the trees.\n\n\"Good evening,\" he said, managing to include Gertrude in his bow.\n\nGertrude had never been even ordinarily courteous to him, and she\nnodded coldly.  Halsey, however, was more cordial, although we were all\nconstrained enough.  He and Gertrude went on together, leaving the\ndetective to walk with me.  As soon as they were out of earshot, he\nturned to me.\n\n\"Do you know, Miss Innes,\" he said, \"the deeper I go into this thing,\nthe more strange it seems to me.  I am very sorry for Miss Gertrude.\nIt looks as if Bailey, whom she has tried so hard to save, is worse\nthan a rascal; and after her plucky fight for him, it seems hard.\"\n\nI looked through the dusk to where Gertrude's light dinner dress\ngleamed among the trees.  She HAD made a plucky fight, poor child.\nWhatever she might have been driven to do, I could find nothing but a\ndeep sympathy for her.  If she had only come to me with the whole truth\nthen!\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" Mr. Jamieson was saying, \"in the last three days, have\nyou seen a--any suspicious figures around the grounds? Any--woman?\"\n\n\"No,\" I replied.  \"I have a houseful of maids that will bear watching,\none and all.  But there has been no strange woman near the house or\nLiddy would have seen her, you may be sure.  She has a telescopic eye.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson looked thoughtful.\n\n\"It may not amount to anything,\" he said slowly.  \"It is difficult to\nget any perspective on things around here, because every one down in\nthe village is sure he saw the murderer, either before or since the\ncrime.  And half of them will stretch a point or two as to facts, to be\nobliging.  But the man who drives the hack down there tells a story\nthat may possibly prove to be important.\"\n\n\"I have heard it, I think.  Was it the one the parlor maid brought up\nyesterday, about a ghost wringing its hands on the roof?  Or perhaps\nit's the one the milk-boy heard: a tramp washing a dirty shirt,\npresumably bloody, in the creek below the bridge?\"\n\nI could see the gleam of Mr. Jamieson's teeth, as he smiled.\n\n\"Neither,\" he said.  \"But Matthew Geist, which is our friend's name,\nclaims that on Saturday night, at nine-thirty, a veiled lady--\"\n\n\"I knew it would be a veiled lady,\" I broke in.\n\n\"A veiled lady,\" he persisted, \"who was apparently young and beautiful,\nengaged his hack and asked to be driven to Sunnyside. Near the gate,\nhowever, she made him stop, in spite of his remonstrances, saying she\npreferred to walk to the house.  She paid him, and he left her there.\nNow, Miss Innes, you had no such visitor, I believe?\"\n\n\"None,\" I said decidedly.\n\n\"Geist thought it might be a maid, as you had got a supply that day.\nBut he said her getting out near the gate puzzled him. Anyhow, we have\nnow one veiled lady, who, with the ghostly intruder of Friday night,\nmakes two assets that I hardly know what to do with.\"\n\n\"It is mystifying,\" I admitted, \"although I can think of one possible\nexplanation.  The path from the Greenwood Club to the village enters\nthe road near the lodge gate.  A woman who wished to reach the Country\nClub, unperceived, might choose such a method.  There are plenty of\nwomen there.\"\n\nI think this gave him something to ponder, for in a short time he said\ngood night and left.  But I myself was far from satisfied. I was\ndetermined, however, on one thing.  If my suspicions--for I had\nsuspicions--were true, I would make my own investigations, and Mr.\nJamieson should learn only what was good for him to know.\n\nWe went back to the house, and Gertrude, who was more like herself\nsince her talk with Halsey, sat down at the mahogany desk in the\nliving-room to write a letter.  Halsey prowled up and down the entire\neast wing, now in the card-room, now in the billiard-room, and now and\nthen blowing his clouds of tobacco smoke among the pink and gold\nhangings of the drawing-room.  After a little I joined him in the\nbilliard-room, and together we went over the details of the discovery\nof the body.\n\nThe card-room was quite dark.  Where we sat, in the billiard-room, only\none of the side brackets was lighted, and we spoke in subdued tones, as\nthe hour and the subject seemed to demand. When I spoke of the figure\nLiddy and I had seen on the porch through the card-room window Friday\nnight, Halsey sauntered into the darkened room, and together we stood\nthere, much as Liddy and I had done that other night.\n\nThe window was the same grayish rectangle in the blackness as before.\nA few feet away in the hall was the spot where the body of Arnold\nArmstrong had been found.  I was a bit nervous, and I put my hand on\nHalsey's sleeve.  Suddenly, from the top of the staircase above us came\nthe sound of a cautious footstep.  At first I was not sure, but\nHalsey's attitude told me he had heard and was listening.  The step,\nslow, measured, infinitely cautious, was nearer now.  Halsey tried to\nloosen my fingers, but I was in a paralysis of fright.\n\nThe swish of a body against the curving rail, as if for guidance, was\nplain enough, and now whoever it was had reached the foot of the\nstaircase and had caught a glimpse of our rigid silhouettes against the\nbilliard-room doorway.  Halsey threw me off then and strode forward.\n\n\"Who is it?\" he called imperiously, and took a half dozen rapid strides\ntoward the foot of the staircase.  Then I heard him mutter something;\nthere was the crash of a falling body, the slam of the outer door, and,\nfor an instant, quiet.  I screamed, I think.  Then I remember turning\non the lights and finding Halsey, white with fury, trying to untangle\nhimself from something warm and fleecy.  He had cut his forehead a\nlittle on the lowest step of the stairs, and he was rather a ghastly\nsight.\n\nHe flung the white object at me, and, jerking open the outer door,\nraced into the darkness.\n\nGertrude had come on hearing the noise, and now we stood, staring at\neach other over--of all things on earth--a white silk and wool blanket,\nexquisitely fine!  It was the most unghostly thing in the world, with\nits lavender border and its faint scent. Gertrude was the first to\nspeak.\n\n\"Somebody--had it?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.  Halsey tried to stop whoever it was and fell.  Gertrude, that\nblanket is not mine.  I have never seen before.\"\n\nShe held it up and looked at it: then she went to the door on to the\nveranda and threw it open.  Perhaps a hundred feet from the house were\ntwo figures, that moved slowly toward us as we looked.\n\nWhen they came within range of the light, I recognized Halsey, and with\nhim Mrs. Watson, the housekeeper.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nONE MYSTERY FOR ANOTHER\n\nThe most commonplace incident takes on a new appearance if the\nattendant circumstances are unusual.  There was no reason on earth why\nMrs. Watson should not have carried a blanket down the east wing\nstaircase, if she so desired.  But to take a blanket down at eleven\no'clock at night, with every precaution as to noise, and, when\ndiscovered, to fling it at Halsey and bolt--Halsey's word, and a good\none--into the grounds,--this made the incident more than significant.\n\nThey moved slowly across the lawn and up the steps.  Halsey was talking\nquietly, and Mrs. Watson was looking down and listening. She was a\nwoman of a certain amount of dignity, most efficient, so far as I could\nsee, although Liddy would have found fault if she dared.  But just now\nMrs. Watson's face was an enigma.  She was defiant, I think, under her\nmask of submission, and she still showed the effect of nervous shock.\n\n\"Mrs. Watson,\" I said severely, \"will you be so good as to explain this\nrather unusual occurrence?\"\n\n\"I don't think it so unusual, Miss Innes.\"  Her voice was deep and very\nclear: just now it was somewhat tremulous.  \"I was taking a blanket\ndown to Thomas, who is--not well to-night, and I used this staircase,\nas being nearer the path to the lodge. When--Mr. Innes called and then\nrushed at me, I--I was alarmed, and flung the blanket at him.\"\n\nHalsey was examining the cut on his forehead in a small mirror on the\nwall.  It was not much of an injury, but it had bled freely, and his\nappearance was rather terrifying.\n\n\"Thomas ill?\" he said, over his shoulder.  \"Why, _I_ thought I saw\nThomas out there as you made that cyclonic break out of the door and\nover the porch.\"\n\nI could see that under pretense of examining his injury he was watching\nher through the mirror.\n\n\"Is this one of the servants' blankets, Mrs. Watson?\" I asked, holding\nup its luxurious folds to the light.\n\n\"Everything else is locked away,\" she replied.  Which was true enough,\nno doubt.  I had rented the house without bed furnishings.\n\n\"If Thomas is ill,\" Halsey said, \"some member of the family ought to go\ndown to see him.  You needn't bother, Mrs. Watson.  I will take the\nblanket.\"\n\nShe drew herself up quickly, as if in protest, but she found nothing to\nsay.  She stood smoothing the folds of her dead black dress, her face\nas white as chalk above it.  Then she seemed to make up her mind.\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Innes,\" she said.  \"Perhaps you would better go. I have\ndone all I could.\"\n\nAnd then she turned and went up the circular staircase, moving slowly\nand with a certain dignity.  Below, the three of us stared at one\nanother across the intervening white blanket.\n\n\"Upon my word,\" Halsey broke out, \"this place is a walking nightmare.\nI have the feeling that we three outsiders who have paid our money for\nthe privilege of staying in this spook-factory, are living on the very\ntop of things.  We're on the lid, so to speak.  Now and then we get a\nsight of the things inside, but we are not a part of them.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose,\" Gertrude asked doubtfully, \"that she really meant\nthat blanket for Thomas?\"\n\n\"Thomas was standing beside that magnolia tree,\" Halsey replied, \"when\nI ran after Mrs. Watson.  It's down to this, Aunt Ray. Rosie's basket\nand Mrs. Watson's blanket can only mean one thing: there is somebody\nhiding or being hidden in the lodge.  It wouldn't surprise me if we\nhold the key to the whole situation now.  Anyhow, I'm going to the\nlodge to investigate.\"\n\nGertrude wanted to go, too, but she looked so shaken that I insisted\nshe should not.  I sent for Liddy to help her to bed, and then Halsey\nand I started for the lodge.  The grass was heavy with dew, and,\nman-like, Halsey chose the shortest way across the lawn.  Half-way,\nhowever, he stopped.\n\n\"We'd better go by the drive,\" he said.  \"This isn't a lawn; it's a\nfield.  Where's the gardener these days?\"\n\n\"There isn't any,\" I said meekly.  \"We have been thankful enough, so\nfar, to have our meals prepared and served and the beds aired. The\ngardener who belongs here is working at the club.\"\n\n\"Remind me to-morrow to send out a man from town,\" he said.  \"I know\nthe very fellow.\"\n\nI record this scrap of conversation, just as I have tried to put down\nanything and everything that had a bearing on what followed, because\nthe gardener Halsey sent the next day played an important part in the\nevents of the next few weeks--events that culminated, as you know, by\nstirring the country profoundly.  At that time, however, I was busy\ntrying to keep my skirts dry, and paid little or no attention to what\nseemed then a most trivial remark.\n\nAlong the drive I showed Halsey where I had found Rosie's basket with\nthe bits of broken china piled inside.  He was rather skeptical.\n\n\"Warner probably,\" he said when I had finished.  \"Began it as a joke on\nRosie, and ended by picking up the broken china out of the road,\nknowing it would play hob with the tires of the car.\" Which shows how\nnear one can come to the truth, and yet miss it altogether.\n\nAt the lodge everything was quiet.  There was a light in the\nsitting-room down-stairs, and a faint gleam, as if from a shaded lamp,\nin one of the upper rooms.  Halsey stopped and examined the lodge with\ncalculating eyes.\n\n\"I don't know, Aunt Ray,\" he said dubiously; \"this is hardly a woman's\naffair.  If there's a scrap of any kind, you hike for the timber.\"\nWhich was Halsey's solicitous care for me, put into vernacular.\n\n\"I shall stay right here,\" I said, and crossing the small veranda, now\nshaded and fragrant with honeysuckle, I hammered the knocker on the\ndoor.\n\nThomas opened the door himself--Thomas, fully dressed and in his\ncustomary health.  I had the blanket over my arm.\n\n\"I brought the blanket, Thomas,\" I said; \"I am sorry you are so ill.\"\n\nThe old man stood staring at me and then at the blanket.  His confusion\nunder other circumstances would have been ludicrous.\n\n\"What!  Not ill?\" Halsey said from the step.  \"Thomas, I'm afraid\nyou've been malingering.\"\n\nThomas seemed to have been debating something with himself.  Now he\nstepped out on the porch and closed the door gently behind him.\n\n\"I reckon you bettah come in, Mis' Innes,\" he said, speaking\ncautiously.  \"It's got so I dunno what to do, and it's boun' to come\nout some time er ruther.\"\n\nHe threw the door open then, and I stepped inside, Halsey close behind.\nIn the sitting-room the old negro turned with quiet dignity to Halsey.\n\n\"You bettah sit down, sah,\" he said.  \"It's a place for a woman, sah.\"\n\nThings were not turning out the way Halsey expected.  He sat down on\nthe center-table, with his hands thrust in his pockets, and watched me\nas I followed Thomas up the narrow stairs.  At the top a woman was\nstanding, and a second glance showed me it was Rosie.\n\nShe shrank back a little, but I said nothing.  And then Thomas motioned\nto a partly open door, and I went in.\n\nThe lodge boasted three bedrooms up-stairs, all comfortably furnished.\nIn this one, the largest and airiest, a night lamp was burning, and by\nits light I could make out a plain white metal bed.  A girl was asleep\nthere--or in a half stupor, for she muttered something now and then.\nRosie had taken her courage in her hands, and coming in had turned up\nthe light.  It was only then that I knew.  Fever-flushed, ill as she\nwas, I recognized Louise Armstrong.\n\nI stood gazing down at her in a stupor of amazement.  Louise here,\nhiding at the lodge, ill and alone!  Rosie came up to the bed and\nsmoothed the white counterpane.\n\n\"I am afraid she is worse to-night,\" she ventured at last. I put my\nhand on the sick girl's forehead.  It was burning with fever, and I\nturned to where Thomas lingered in the hallway.\n\n\"Will you tell me what you mean, Thomas Johnson, by not telling me this\nbefore?\" I demanded indignantly.\n\nThomas quailed.\n\n\"Mis' Louise wouldn' let me,\" he said earnestly.  \"I wanted to. She\nought to 'a' had a doctor the night she came, but she wouldn' hear to\nit.  Is she--is she very bad, Mis' Innes?\"\n\n\"Bad enough,\" I said coldly.  \"Send Mr. Innes up.\"\n\nHalsey came up the stairs slowly, looking rather interested and\ninclined to be amused.  For a moment he could not see anything\ndistinctly in the darkened room; he stopped, glanced at Rosie and at\nme, and then his eyes fell on the restless head on the pillow.\n\nI think he felt who it was before he really saw her; he crossed the\nroom in a couple of strides and bent over the bed.\n\n\"Louise!\" he said softly; but she did not reply, and her eyes showed no\nrecognition.  Halsey was young, and illness was new to him.  He\nstraightened himself slowly, still watching her, and caught my arm.\n\n\"She's dying, Aunt Ray!\" he said huskily.  \"Dying!  Why, she doesn't\nknow me!\"\n\n\"Fudge!\" I snapped, being apt to grow irritable when my sympathies are\naroused.  \"She's doing nothing of the sort,--and don't pinch my arm.\nIf you want something to do, go and choke Thomas.\"\n\nBut at that moment Louise roused from her stupor to cough, and at the\nend of the paroxysm, as Rosie laid her back, exhausted, she knew us.\nThat was all Halsey wanted; to him consciousness was recovery.  He\ndropped on his knees beside the bed, and tried to tell her she was all\nright, and we would bring her around in a hurry, and how beautiful she\nlooked--only to break down utterly and have to stop.  And at that I\ncame to my senses, and put him out.\n\n\"This instant!\" I ordered, as he hesitated.  \"And send Rosie here.\"\n\nHe did not go far.  He sat on the top step of the stairs, only leaving\nto telephone for a doctor, and getting in everybody's way in his\neagerness to fetch and carry.  I got him away finally, by sending him\nto fix up the car as a sort of ambulance, in case the doctor would\nallow the sick girl to be moved.  He sent Gertrude down to the lodge\nloaded with all manner of impossible things, including an armful of\nTurkish towels and a box of mustard plasters, and as the two girls had\nknown each other somewhat before, Louise brightened perceptibly when\nshe saw her.\n\nWhen the doctor from Englewood--the Casanova doctor, Doctor Walker,\nbeing away--had started for Sunnyside, and I had got Thomas to stop\ntrying to explain what he did not understand himself, I had a long talk\nwith the old man, and this is what I learned.\n\nOn Saturday evening before, about ten o'clock, he had been reading in\nthe sitting-room down-stairs, when some one rapped at the door.  The\nold man was alone, Warner not having arrived, and at first he was\nuncertain about opening the door.  He did so finally, and was amazed at\nbeing confronted by Louise Armstrong. Thomas was an old family servant,\nhaving been with the present Mrs. Armstrong since she was a child, and\nhe was overwhelmed at seeing Louise.  He saw that she was excited and\ntired, and he drew her into the sitting-room and made her sit down.\nAfter a while he went to the house and brought Mrs. Watson, and they\ntalked until late.  The old man said Louise was in trouble, and seemed\nfrightened.  Mrs. Watson made some tea and took it to the lodge, but\nLouise made them both promise to keep her presence a secret.  She had\nnot known that Sunnyside was rented, and whatever her trouble was, this\ncomplicated things.  She seemed puzzled.  Her stepfather and her mother\nwere still in California--that was all she would say about them.  Why\nshe had run away no one could imagine.  Mr. Arnold Armstrong was at the\nGreenwood Club, and at last Thomas, not knowing what else to do, went\nover there along the path.  It was almost midnight. Part-way over he\nmet Armstrong himself and brought him to the lodge. Mrs. Watson had\ngone to the house for some bed-linen, it having been arranged that\nunder the circumstances Louise would be better at the lodge until\nmorning.  Arnold Armstrong and Louise had a long conference, during\nwhich he was heard to storm and become very violent.  When he left it\nwas after two.  He had gone up to the house--Thomas did not know\nwhy--and at three o'clock he was shot at the foot of the circular\nstaircase.\n\nThe following morning Louise had been ill.  She had asked for Arnold,\nand was told he had left town.  Thomas had not the moral courage to\ntell her of the crime.  She refused a doctor, and shrank morbidly from\nhaving her presence known.  Mrs. Watson and Thomas had had their hands\nfull, and at last Rosie had been enlisted to help them.  She carried\nnecessary provisions--little enough--to the lodge, and helped to keep\nthe secret.\n\nThomas told me quite frankly that he had been anxious to keep Louise's\npresence hidden for this reason: they had all seen Arnold Armstrong\nthat night, and he, himself, for one, was known to have had no very\nfriendly feeling for the dead man.  As to the reason for Louise's\nflight from California, or why she had not gone to the Fitzhughs', or\nto some of her people in town, he had no more information than I had.\nWith the death of her stepfather and the prospect of the immediate\nreturn of the family, things had become more and more impossible.  I\ngathered that Thomas was as relieved as I at the turn events had taken.\nNo, she did not know of either of the deaths in the family.\n\nTaken all around, I had only substituted one mystery for another.\n\nIf I knew now why Rosie had taken the basket of dishes, I did not know\nwho had spoken to her and followed her along the drive.  If I knew that\nLouise was in the lodge, I did not know why she was there.  If I knew\nthat Arnold Armstrong had spent some time in the lodge the night before\nhe was murdered, I was no nearer the solution of the crime.  Who was\nthe midnight intruder who had so alarmed Liddy and myself?  Who had\nfallen down the clothes chute?  Was Gertrude's lover a villain or a\nvictim?  Time was to answer all these things.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nLOUISE\n\nThe doctor from Englewood came very soon, and I went up to see the sick\ngirl with him.  Halsey had gone to supervise the fitting of the car\nwith blankets and pillows, and Gertrude was opening and airing Louise's\nown rooms at the house.  Her private sitting-room, bedroom and\ndressing-room were as they had been when we came.  They occupied the\nend of the east wing, beyond the circular staircase, and we had not\neven opened them.\n\nThe girl herself was too ill to notice what was being done. When, with\nthe help of the doctor, who was a fatherly man with a family of girls\nat home, we got her to the house and up the stairs into bed, she\ndropped into a feverish sleep, which lasted until morning.  Doctor\nStewart--that was the Englewood doctor--stayed almost all night, giving\nthe medicine himself, and watching her closely.  Afterward he told me\nthat she had had a narrow escape from pneumonia, and that the cerebral\nsymptoms had been rather alarming.  I said I was glad it wasn't an\n\"itis\" of some kind, anyhow, and he smiled solemnly.\n\nHe left after breakfast, saying that he thought the worst of the danger\nwas over, and that she must be kept very quiet.\n\n\"The shock of two deaths, I suppose, has done this,\" he remarked,\npicking up his case.  \"It has been very deplorable.\"\n\nI hastened to set him right.\n\n\"She does not know of either, Doctor,\" I said.  \"Please do not mention\nthem to her.\"\n\nHe looked as surprised as a medical man ever does.\n\n\"I do not know the family,\" he said, preparing to get into his top\nbuggy.  \"Young Walker, down in Casanova, has been attending them.  I\nunderstand he is going to marry this young lady.\"\n\n\"You have been misinformed,\" I said stiffly.  \"Miss Armstrong is going\nto marry my nephew.\"\n\nThe doctor smiled as he picked up the reins.\n\n\"Young ladies are changeable these days,\" he said.  \"We thought the\nwedding was to occur soon.  Well, I will stop in this afternoon to see\nhow my patient is getting along.\"\n\nHe drove away then, and I stood looking after him.  He was a doctor of\nthe old school, of the class of family practitioner that is fast dying\nout; a loyal and honorable gentleman who was at once physician and\nconfidential adviser to his patients.  When I was a girl we called in\nthe doctor alike when we had measles, or when mother's sister died in\nthe far West.  He cut out redundant tonsils and brought the babies with\nthe same air of inspiring self-confidence.  Nowadays it requires a\ndifferent specialist for each of these occurrences.  When the babies\ncried, old Doctor Wainwright gave them peppermint and dropped warm\nsweet oil in their ears with sublime faith that if it was not colic it\nwas earache.  When, at the end of a year, father met him driving in his\nhigh side-bar buggy with the white mare ambling along, and asked for a\nbill, the doctor used to go home, estimate what his services were worth\nfor that period, divide it in half--I don't think he kept any\nbooks--and send father a statement, in a cramped hand, on a sheet of\nruled white paper.  He was an honored guest at all the weddings,\nchristenings, and funerals--yes, funerals--for every one knew he had\ndone his best, and there was no gainsaying the ways of Providence.\n\nAh, well, Doctor Wainwright is gone, and I am an elderly woman with an\nincreasing tendency to live in the past.  The contrast between my old\ndoctor at home and the Casanova doctor, Frank Walker, always rouses me\nto wrath and digression.\n\nSome time about noon of that day, Wednesday, Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh\ntelephoned me.  I have the barest acquaintance with her--she managed to\nbe put on the governing board of the Old Ladies' Home and ruins their\ndigestions by sending them ice-cream and cake on every holiday.  Beyond\nthat, and her reputation at bridge, which is insufferably bad--she is\nthe worst player at the bridge club--I know little of her.  It was she\nwho had taken charge of Arnold Armstrong's funeral, however, and I went\nat once to the telephone.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"this is Miss Innes.\"\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" she said volubly, \"I have just received a very strange\ntelegram from my cousin, Mrs. Armstrong.  Her husband died yesterday,\nin California and--wait, I will read you the message.\"\n\nI knew what was coming, and I made up my mind at once.  If Louise\nArmstrong had a good and sufficient reason for leaving her people and\ncoming home, a reason, moreover, that kept her from going at once to\nMrs. Ogden Fitzhugh, and that brought her to the lodge at Sunnyside\ninstead, it was not my intention to betray her.  Louise herself must\nnotify her people.  I do not justify myself now, but remember, I was in\na peculiar position toward the Armstrong family.  I was connected most\nunpleasantly with a cold-blooded crime, and my niece and nephew were\npractically beggared, either directly or indirectly, through the head\nof the family.\n\nMrs. Fitzhugh had found the message.\n\n\"'Paul died yesterday.  Heart disease,'\" she read.  \"'Wire at once if\nLouise is with you.'  You see, Miss Innes, Louise must have started\neast, and Fanny is alarmed about her.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"Louise is not here,\" Mrs. Fitzhugh went on, \"and none of her\nfriends--the few who are still in town--has seen her.  I called you\nbecause Sunnyside was not rented when she went away, and Louise might\nhave, gone there.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, Mrs. Fitzhugh, but I can not help you,\" I said, and was\nimmediately filled with compunction.  Suppose Louise grew worse?  Who\nwas I to play Providence in this case?  The anxious mother certainly\nhad a right to know that her daughter was in good hands.  So I broke in\non Mrs. Fitzhugh's voluble excuses for disturbing me.\n\n\"Mrs. Fitzhugh,\" I said.  \"I was going to let you think I knew nothing\nabout Louise Armstrong, but I have changed my mind. Louise is here,\nwith me.\"  There was a clatter of ejaculations at the other end of the\nwire.  \"She is ill, and not able to be moved.  Moreover, she is unable\nto see any one.  I wish you would wire her mother that she is with me,\nand tell her not to worry. No, I do not know why she came east.\"\n\n\"But my dear Miss Innes!\" Mrs. Fitzhugh began.  I cut in ruthlessly.\n\n\"I will send for you as soon as she can see you,\" I said.  \"No, she is\nnot in a critical state now, but the doctor says she must have absolute\nquiet.\"\n\nWhen I had hung up the receiver, I sat down to think.  So Louise had\nfled from her people in California, and had come east alone! It was not\na new idea, but why had she done it?  It occurred to me that Doctor\nWalker might be concerned in it, might possibly have bothered her with\nunwelcome attentions; but it seemed to me that Louise was hardly a girl\nto take refuge in flight under such circumstances.  She had always been\nhigh-spirited, with the well-poised head and buoyant step of the\noutdoors girl. It must have been much more in keeping with Louise's\ncharacter, as I knew it, to resent vigorously any unwelcome attentions\nfrom Doctor Walker.  It was the suitor whom I should have expected to\nsee in headlong flight, not the lady in the case.\n\nThe puzzle was no clearer at the end of the half-hour.  I picked up the\nmorning papers, which were still full of the looting of the Traders'\nBank, the interest at fever height again, on account of Paul\nArmstrong's death.  The bank examiners were working on the books, and\nsaid nothing for publication: John Bailey had been released on bond.\nThe body of Paul Armstrong would arrive Sunday and would be buried from\nthe Armstrong town house.  There were rumors that the dead man's estate\nhad been a comparatively small one.  The last paragraph was the\nimportant one.\n\nWalter P. Broadhurst, of the Marine Bank, had produced two hundred\nAmerican Traction bonds, which had been placed as security with the\nMarine Bank for a loan of one hundred and sixty thousand dollars, made\nto Paul Armstrong, just before his California trip.  The bonds were a\npart of the missing traction bonds from the Traders' Bank!  While this\ninvolved the late president of the wrecked bank, to my mind it by no\nmeans cleared its cashier.\n\nThe gardener mentioned by Halsey came out about two o'clock in the\nafternoon, and walked up from the station.  I was favorably impressed\nby him.  His references were good--he had been employed by the Brays'\nuntil they went to Europe, and he looked young and vigorous.  He asked\nfor one assistant, and I was glad enough to get off so easily.  He was\na pleasant-faced young fellow, with black hair and blue eyes, and his\nname was Alexander Graham.  I have been particular about Alex, because,\nas I said before, he played an important part later.\n\nThat afternoon I had a new insight into the character of the dead\nbanker.  I had my first conversation with Louise.  She sent for me, and\nagainst my better judgment I went.  There were so many things she could\nnot be told, in her weakened condition, that I dreaded the interview.\nIt was much easier than I expected, however, because she asked no\nquestions.\n\nGertrude had gone to bed, having been up almost all night, and Halsey\nwas absent on one of those mysterious absences of his that grew more\nand more frequent as time went on, until it culminated in the event of\nthe night of June the tenth.  Liddy was in attendance in the sick-room.\nThere being little or nothing to do, she seemed to spend her time\nsmoothing the wrinkles from the counterpane.  Louise lay under a field\nof virgin white, folded back at an angle of geometrical exactness, and\nnecessitating a readjustment every time the sick girl turned.\n\nLiddy heard my approach and came out to meet me.  She seemed to be in a\nperpetual state of goose-flesh, and she had got in the habit of looking\npast me when she talked, as if she saw things. It had the effect of\nmaking me look over my shoulder to see what she was staring at, and was\nintensely irritating.\n\n\"She's awake,\" Liddy said, looking uneasily down the circular\nstaircase, which was beside me.  \"She was talkin' in her sleep\nsomething awful--about dead men and coffins.\"\n\n\"Liddy,\" I said sternly, \"did you breathe a word about everything not\nbeing right here?\"\n\nLiddy's gaze had wandered to the door of the chute, now bolted securely.\n\n\"Not a word,\" she said, \"beyond asking her a question or two, which\nthere was no harm in.  She says there never was a ghost known here.\"\n\nI glared at her, speechless, and closing the door into Louise's\nboudoir, to Liddy's great disappointment, I went on to the bedroom\nbeyond.\n\nWhatever Paul Armstrong had been, he had been lavish with his\nstepdaughter.  Gertrude's rooms at home were always beautiful\napartments, but the three rooms in the east wing at Sunnyside, set\napart for the daughter of the house, were much more splendid.\n\nFrom the walls to the rugs on the floor, from the furniture to the\nappointments of the bath, with its pool sunk in the floor instead of\nthe customary unlovely tub, everything was luxurious. In the bedroom\nLouise was watching for me.  It was easy to see that she was much\nimproved; the flush was going, and the peculiar gasping breathing of\nthe night before was now a comfortable and easy respiration.\n\nShe held out her hand and I took it between both of mine.\n\n\"What can I say to you, Miss Innes?\" she said slowly.  \"To have come\nlike this--\"\n\nI thought she was going to break down, but she did not.\n\n\"You are not to think of anything but of getting well,\" I said, patting\nher hand.  \"When you are better, I am going to scold you for not coming\nhere at once.  This is your home, my dear, and of all people in the\nworld, Halsey's old aunt ought to make you welcome.\"\n\nShe smiled a little, sadly, I thought.\n\n\"I ought not to see Halsey,\" she said.  \"Miss Innes, there are a great\nmany things you will never understand, I am afraid.  I am an impostor\non your sympathy, because I--I stay here and let you lavish care on me,\nand all the time I know you are going to despise me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said briskly.  \"Why, what would Halsey do to me if I even\nventured such a thing?  He is so big and masterful that if I dared to\nbe anything but rapturous over you, he would throw me out of a window.\nIndeed, he would be quite capable of it.\"\n\nShe seemed scarcely to hear my facetious tone.  She had eloquent brown\neyes--the Inneses are fair, and are prone to a grayish-green optic that\nis better for use than appearance--and they seemed now to be clouded\nwith trouble.\n\n\"Poor Halsey!\" she said softly.  \"Miss Innes, I can not marry him, and\nI am afraid to tell him.  I am a coward--a coward!\"\n\nI sat beside the bed and stared at her.  She was too ill to argue with,\nand, besides, sick people take queer fancies.\n\n\"We will talk about that when you are stronger,\" I said gently.\n\n\"But there are some things I must tell you,\" she insisted.  \"You must\nwonder how I came here, and why I stayed hidden at the lodge.  Dear old\nThomas has been almost crazy, Miss Innes.  I did not know that\nSunnyside was rented.  I knew my mother wished to rent it, without\ntelling my--stepfather, but the news must have reached her after I\nleft.  When I started east, I had only one idea--to be alone with my\nthoughts for a time, to bury myself here.  Then, I--must have taken a\ncold on the train.\"\n\n\"You came east in clothing suitable for California,\" I said, \"and, like\nall young girls nowadays, I don't suppose you wear flannels.\"  But she\nwas not listening.\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" she said, \"has my stepbrother Arnold gone away?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked, startled.  But Louise was literal.\n\n\"He didn't come back that night,\" she said, \"and it was so important\nthat I should see him.\"\n\n\"I believe he has gone away,\" I replied uncertainly.  \"Isn't it\nsomething that we could attend to instead?\"\n\nBut she shook her head.  \"I must do it myself,\" she said dully. \"My\nmother must have rented Sunnyside without telling my stepfather,\nand--Miss Innes, did you ever hear of any one being wretchedly poor in\nthe midst of luxury?\n\n\"Did you ever long, and long, for money--money to use without question,\nmoney that no one would take you to task about?  My mother and I have\nbeen surrounded for years with every indulgence everything that would\nmake a display.  But we have never had any money, Miss Innes; that must\nhave been why mother rented this house.  My stepfather pays our bills.\nIt's the most maddening, humiliating existence in the world.  I would\nlove honest poverty better.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" I said; \"when you and Halsey are married you can be as\nhonest as you like, and you will certainly be poor.\"\n\nHalsey came to the door at that moment and I could hear him coaxing\nLiddy for admission to the sick room.\n\n\"Shall I bring him in?\" I asked Louise, uncertain what to do. The girl\nseemed to shrink back among her pillows at the sound of his voice.  I\nwas vaguely irritated with her; there are few young fellows like\nHalsey--straightforward, honest, and willing to sacrifice everything\nfor the one woman.  I knew one once, more than thirty years ago, who\nwas like that: he died a long time ago.  And sometimes I take out his\npicture, with its cane and its queer silk hat, and look at it.  But of\nlate years it has grown too painful: he is always a boy--and I am an\nold woman.  I would not bring him back if I could.\n\nPerhaps it was some such memory that made me call out sharply.\n\n\"Come in, Halsey.\"  And then I took my sewing and went into the boudoir\nbeyond, to play propriety.  I did not try to hear what they said, but\nevery word came through the open door with curious distinctness.\nHalsey had evidently gone over to the bed and I suppose he kissed her.\nThere was silence for a moment, as if words were superfluous things.\n\n\"I have been almost wild, sweetheart,\"--Halsey's voice.  \"Why didn't\nyou trust me, and send for me before?\"\n\n\"It was because I couldn't trust myself,\" she said in a low tone.\n\n\"I am too weak to struggle to-day; oh, Halsey, how I have wanted to see\nyou!\"\n\nThere was something I did not hear, then Halsey again.\n\n\"We could go away,\" he was saying.  \"What does it matter about any one\nin the world but just the two of us?  To be always together, like this,\nhand in hand; Louise--don't tell me it isn't going to be.  I won't\nbelieve you.\"\n\n\"You don't know; you don't know,\" Louise repeated dully. \"Halsey, I\ncare--you know that--but--not enough to marry you.\"\n\n\"That is not true, Louise,\" he said sternly.  \"You can not look at me\nwith your honest eyes and say that.\"\n\n\"I can not marry you,\" she repeated miserably.  \"It's bad enough, isn't\nit?  Don't make it worse.  Some day, before long, you will be glad.\"\n\n\"Then it is because you have never loved me.\"  There were depths of\nhurt pride in his voice.  \"You saw how much I loved you, and you let me\nthink you cared--for a while.  No--that isn't like you, Louise.  There\nis something you haven't told me.  Is it--because there is some one\nelse?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" almost inaudibly.\n\n\"Louise!  Oh, I don't believe it.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" she said sadly.  \"Halsey, you must not try to see me\nagain.  As soon as I can, I am going away from here--where you are all\nso much kinder than I deserve.  And whatever you hear about me, try to\nthink as well of me as you can.  I am going to marry--another man.  How\nyou must hate me--hate me!\"\n\nI could hear Halsey cross the room to the window.  Then, after a pause,\nhe went back to her again.  I could hardly sit still; I wanted to go in\nand give her a good shaking.\n\n\"Then it's all over,\" he was saying with a long breath.  \"The plans we\nmade together, the hopes, the--all of it--over!  Well, I'll not be a\nbaby, and I'll give you up the minute you say 'I don't love you and I\ndo love--some one else'!\"\n\n\"I can not say that,\" she breathed, \"but, very soon, I shall marry--the\nother man.\"\n\nI could hear Halsey's low triumphant laugh.\n\n\"I defy him,\" he said.  \"Sweetheart, as long as you care for me, I am\nnot afraid.\"\n\nThe wind slammed the door between the two rooms just then, and I could\nhear nothing more, although I moved my chair quite close. After a\ndiscreet interval, I went into the other room, and found Louise alone.\nShe was staring with sad eyes at the cherub painted on the ceiling over\nthe bed, and because she looked tired I did not disturb her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAN EGG-NOG AND A TELEGRAM\n\nWe had discovered Louise at the lodge Tuesday night.  It was Wednesday\nI had my interview with her.  Thursday and Friday were uneventful, save\nas they marked improvement in our patient. Gertrude spent almost all\nthe time with her, and the two had grown to be great friends.  But\ncertain things hung over me constantly; the coroner's inquest on the\ndeath of Arnold Armstrong, to be held Saturday, and the arrival of Mrs.\nArmstrong and young Doctor Walker, bringing the body of the dead\npresident of the Traders' Bank.  We had not told Louise of either death.\n\nThen, too, I was anxious about the children.  With their mother's\ninheritance swept away in the wreck of the bank, and with their love\naffairs in a disastrous condition, things could scarcely be worse.\nAdded to that, the cook and Liddy had a flare-up over the proper way to\nmake beef-tea for Louise, and, of course, the cook left.\n\nMrs. Watson had been glad enough, I think, to turn Louise over to our\ncare, and Thomas went upstairs night and morning to greet his young\nmistress from the doorway.  Poor Thomas!  He had the faculty--found\nstill in some old negroes, who cling to the traditions of slavery\ndays--of making his employer's interest his.  It was always \"we\" with\nThomas; I miss him sorely; pipe-smoking, obsequious, not over reliable,\nkindly old man!\n\nOn Thursday Mr. Harton, the Armstrongs' legal adviser, called up from\ntown.  He had been advised, he said, that Mrs. Armstrong was coming\neast with her husband's body and would arrive Monday.  He came with\nsome hesitation, he went on, to the fact that he had been further\ninstructed to ask me to relinquish my lease on Sunnyside, as it was\nMrs. Armstrong's desire to come directly there.\n\nI was aghast.\n\n\"Here!\" I said.  \"Surely you are mistaken, Mr. Harton.  I should think,\nafter--what happened here only a few days ago, she would never wish to\ncome back.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" he replied, \"she is most anxious to come.  This is what\nshe says.  'Use every possible means to have Sunnyside vacated.  Must\ngo there at once.'\"\n\n\"Mr. Harton,\" I said testily, \"I am not going to do anything of the\nkind.  I and mine have suffered enough at the hands of this family.  I\nrented the house at an exorbitant figure and I have moved out here for\nthe summer.  My city home is dismantled and in the hands of decorators.\nI have been here one week, during which I have had not a single night\nof uninterrupted sleep, and I intend to stay until I have recuperated.\nMoreover, if Mr. Armstrong died insolvent, as I believe was the case,\nhis widow ought to be glad to be rid of so expensive a piece of\nproperty.\"\n\nThe lawyer cleared his throat.\n\n\"I am very sorry you have made this decision,\" he said.  \"Miss Innes,\nMrs. Fitzhugh tells me Louise Armstrong is with you.\"\n\n\"She is.\"\n\n\"Has she been informed of this--double bereavement?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" I said.  \"She has been very ill; perhaps to-night she can be\ntold.\"\n\n\"It is very sad; very sad,\" he said.  \"I have a telegram for her, Mrs.\nInnes.  Shall I send it out?\"\n\n\"Better open it and read it to me,\" I suggested.  \"If it is important,\nthat will save time.\"\n\nThere was a pause while Mr. Harton opened the telegram.  Then he read\nit slowly, judicially.\n\n\"'Watch for Nina Carrington.  Home Monday.  Signed F. L. W.'\"\n\n\"Hum!\" I said.  \"'Watch for Nina Carrington.  Home Monday.'  Very well,\nMr. Harton, I will tell her, but she is not in condition to watch for\nany one.\"\n\n\"Well, Miss Innes, if you decide to--er--relinquish the lease, let me\nknow,\" the lawyer said.\n\n\"I shall not relinquish it,\" I replied, and I imagined his irritation\nfrom the way he hung up the receiver.\n\nI wrote the telegram down word for word, afraid to trust my memory, and\ndecided to ask Doctor Stewart how soon Louise might be told the truth.\nThe closing of the Traders' Bank I considered unnecessary for her to\nknow, but the death of her stepfather and stepbrother must be broken to\nher soon, or she might hear it in some unexpected and shocking manner.\n\nDoctor Stewart came about four o'clock, bringing his leather satchel\ninto the house with a great deal of care, and opening it at the foot of\nthe stairs to show me a dozen big yellow eggs nesting among the bottles.\n\n\"Real eggs,\" he said proudly.  \"None of your anemic store eggs, but the\nreal thing--some of them still warm.  Feel them!  Egg-nog for Miss\nLouise.\"\n\nHe was beaming with satisfaction, and before he left, he insisted on\ngoing back to the pantry and making an egg-nog with his own hands.\nSomehow, all the time he was doing it, I had a vision of Doctor\nWilloughby, my nerve specialist in the city, trying to make an egg-nog.\nI wondered if he ever prescribed anything so plebeian--and so\ndelicious.  And while Doctor Stewart whisked the eggs he talked.\n\n\"I said to Mrs. Stewart,\" he confided, a little red in the face from\nthe exertion, \"after I went home the other day, that you would think me\nan old gossip, for saying what I did about Walker and Miss Louise.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" I protested.\n\n\"The fact is,\" he went on, evidently justifying him self, \"I got that\npiece of information just as we get a lot of things, through the\nkitchen end of the house.  Young Walker's chauffeur--Walker's more\nfashionable than I am, and he goes around the country in a Stanhope\ncar--well, his chauffeur comes to see our servant girl, and he told her\nthe whole thing.  I thought it was probable, because Walker spent a lot\nof time up here last summer, when the family was here, and besides,\nRiggs, that's Walker's man, had a very pat little story about the\ndoctor's building a house on this property, just at the foot of the\nhill.  The sugar, please.\"\n\nThe egg-nog was finished.  Drop by drop the liquor had cooked the egg,\nand now, with a final whisk, a last toss in the shaker, it was ready, a\nsymphony in gold and white.  The doctor sniffed it.\n\n\"Real eggs, real milk, and a touch of real Kentucky whisky,\" he said.\n\nHe insisted on carrying it up himself, but at the foot of the stairs he\npaused.\n\n\"Riggs said the plans were drawn for the house,\" he said, harking back\nto the old subject.  \"Drawn by Huston in town.  So I naturally believed\nhim.\"\n\nWhen the doctor came down, I was ready with a question.\n\n\"Doctor,\" I asked, \"is there any one in the neighborhood named\nCarrington?  Nina Carrington?\"\n\n\"Carrington?\"  He wrinkled his forehead.  \"Carrington?  No, I don't\nremember any such family.  There used to be Covingtons down the creek.\"\n\n\"The name was Carrington,\" I said, and the subject lapsed.\n\nGertrude and Halsey went for a long walk that afternoon, and Louise\nslept.  Time hung heavy on my hands, and I did as I had fallen into a\nhabit of doing lately--I sat down and thought things over.  One result\nof my meditations was that I got up suddenly and went to the telephone.\nI had taken the most intense dislike to this Doctor Walker, whom I had\nnever seen, and who was being talked of in the countryside as the\nfiance of Louise Armstrong.\n\nI knew Sam Huston well.  There had been a time, when Sam was a good\ndeal younger than he is now, before he had married Anne Endicott, when\nI knew him even better.  So now I felt no hesitation in calling him\nover the telephone.  But when his office boy had given way to his\nconfidential clerk, and that functionary had condescended to connect\nhis employer's desk telephone, I was somewhat at a loss as to how to\nbegin.\n\n\"Why, how are you, Rachel?\" Sam said sonorously.  \"Going to build that\nhouse at Rock View?\"  It was a twenty-year-old joke of his.\n\n\"Sometime, perhaps,\" I said.  \"Just now I want to ask you a question\nabout something which is none of my business.\"\n\n\"I see you haven't changed an iota in a quarter of a century, Rachel.\"\nThis was intended to be another jest.  \"Ask ahead: everything but my\ndomestic affairs is at your service.\"\n\n\"Try to be serious,\" I said.  \"And tell me this: has your firm made any\nplans for a house recently, for a Doctor Walker, at Casanova?\"\n\n\"Yes, we have.\"\n\n\"Where was it to be built?  I have a reason for asking.\"\n\n\"It was to be, I believe, on the Armstrong place.  Mr. Armstrong\nhimself consulted me, and the inference was--in fact, I am quite\ncertain--the house was to be occupied by Mr. Armstrong's daughter, who\nwas engaged to marry Doctor Walker.\"\n\nWhen the architect had inquired for the different members of my family,\nand had finally rung off, I was certain of one thing. Louise Armstrong\nwas in love with Halsey, and the man she was going to marry was Doctor\nWalker.  Moreover, this decision was not new; marriage had been\ncontemplated for some time. There must certainly be some\nexplanation--but what was it?\n\nThat day I repeated to Louise the telegram Mr. Warton had opened.\n\nShe seemed to understand, but an unhappier face I have never seen.  She\nlooked like a criminal whose reprieve is over, and the day of execution\napproaching.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nLIDDY GIVES THE ALARM\n\nThe next day, Friday, Gertrude broke the news of her stepfather's death\nto Louise.  She did it as gently as she could, telling her first that\nhe was very ill, and finally that he was dead.  Louise received the\nnews in the most unexpected manner, and when Gertrude came out to tell\nme how she had stood it, I think she was almost shocked.\n\n\"She just lay and stared at me, Aunt Ray,\" she said.  \"Do you know, I\nbelieve she is glad, glad!  And she is too honest to pretend anything\nelse.  What sort of man was Mr. Paul Armstrong, anyhow?\"\n\n\"He was a bully as well as a rascal, Gertrude,\" I said.  \"But I am\nconvinced of one thing; Louise will send for Halsey now, and they will\nmake it all up.\"\n\nFor Louise had steadily refused to see Halsey all that day, and the boy\nwas frantic.\n\nWe had a quiet hour, Halsey and I, that evening, and I told him several\nthings; about the request that we give up the lease to Sunnyside, about\nthe telegram to Louise, about the rumors of an approaching marriage\nbetween the girl and Doctor Walker, and, last of all, my own interview\nwith her the day before.\n\nHe sat back in a big chair, with his face in the shadow, and my heart\nfairly ached for him.  He was so big and so boyish!  When I had\nfinished he drew a long breath.\n\n\"Whatever Louise does,\" he said, \"nothing will convince me, Aunt Ray,\nthat she doesn't care for me.  And up to two months ago, when she and\nher mother went west, I was the happiest fellow on earth.  Then\nsomething made a difference: she wrote me that her people were opposed\nto the marriage; that her feeling for me was what it had always been,\nbut that something had happened which had changed her ideas as to the\nfuture.  I was not to write until she wrote me, and whatever occurred,\nI was to think the best I could of her.  It sounded like a puzzle.\nWhen I saw her yesterday, it was the same thing, only, perhaps, worse.\"\n\n\"Halsey,\" I asked, \"have you any idea of the nature of the interview\nbetween Louise Armstrong and Arnold the night he was murdered?\"\n\n\"It was stormy.  Thomas says once or twice he almost broke into the\nroom, he was so alarmed for Louise.\"\n\n\"Another thing, Halsey,\" I said, \"have you ever heard Louise mention a\nwoman named Carrington, Nina Carrington?\"\n\n\"Never,\" he said positively.\n\nFor try as we would, our thoughts always came back to that fatal\nSaturday night, and the murder.  Every conversational path led to it,\nand we all felt that Jamieson was tightening the threads of evidence\naround John Bailey.  The detective's absence was hardly reassuring; he\nmust have had something to work on in town, or he would have returned.\n\nThe papers reported that the cashier of the Traders' Bank was ill in\nhis apartments at the Knickerbocker--a condition not surprising,\nconsidering everything.  The guilt of the defunct president was no\nlonger in doubt; the missing bonds had been advertised and some of them\ndiscovered.  In every instance they had been used as collateral for\nlarge loans, and the belief was current that not less than a million\nand a half dollars had been realized.  Every one connected with the\nbank had been placed under arrest, and released on heavy bond.\n\nWas he alone in his guilt, or was the cashier his accomplice? Where was\nthe money?  The estate of the dead man was comparatively small--a city\nhouse on a fashionable street, Sunnyside, a large estate largely\nmortgaged, an insurance of fifty thousand dollars, and some personal\nproperty--this was all.\n\nThe rest lost in speculation probably, the papers said.  There was one\nthing which looked uncomfortable for Jack Bailey: he and Paul Armstrong\ntogether had promoted a railroad company in New Mexico, and it was\nrumored that together they had sunk large sums of money there.  The\nbusiness alliance between the two men added to the belief that Bailey\nknew something of the looting.  His unexplained absence from the bank\non Monday lent color to the suspicion against him.  The strange thing\nseemed to be his surrendering himself on the point of departure.  To\nme, it seemed the shrewd calculation of a clever rascal.  I was not\nactively antagonistic to Gertrude's lover, but I meant to be convinced,\none way or the other.  I took no one on faith.\n\nThat night the Sunnyside ghost began to walk again.  Liddy had been\nsleeping in Louise's dressing-room on a couch, and the approach of dusk\nwas a signal for her to barricade the entire suite.  Situated as its\nwas, beyond the circular staircase, nothing but an extremity of\nexcitement would have made her pass it after dark.  I confess myself\nthat the place seemed to me to have a sinister appearance, but we kept\nthat wing well lighted, and until the lights went out at midnight it\nwas really cheerful, if one did not know its history.\n\nOn Friday night, then, I had gone to bed, resolved to go at once to\nsleep.  Thoughts that insisted on obtruding themselves I pushed\nresolutely to the back of my mind, and I systematically relaxed every\nmuscle.  I fell asleep soon, and was dreaming that Doctor Walker was\nbuilding his new house immediately in front of my windows: I could hear\nthe thump-thump of the hammers, and then I waked to a knowledge that\nsomebody was pounding on my door.\n\nI was up at once, and with the sound of my footstep on the floor the\nlow knocking ceased, to be followed immediately by sibilant whispering\nthrough the keyhole.\n\n\"Miss Rachel! Miss Rachel!\" somebody was saying, over and over.\n\n\"Is that you, Liddy?\" I asked, my hand on the knob.\n\n\"For the love of mercy, let me in!\" she said in a low tone.\n\nShe was leaning against the door, for when I opened it, she fell in.\nShe was greenish-white, and she had a red and black barred flannel\npetticoat over her shoulders.\n\n\"Listen,\" she said, standing in the middle of the floor and holding on\nto me.  \"Oh, Miss Rachel, it's the ghost of that dead man hammering to\nget in!\"\n\nSure enough, there was a dull thud--thud--thud from some place near.\nIt was muffled: one rather felt than heard it, and it was impossible to\nlocate.  One moment it seemed to come, three taps and a pause, from the\nfloor under us: the next, thud--thud--thud--it came apparently from the\nwall.\n\n\"It's not a ghost,\" I said decidedly.  \"If it was a ghost it wouldn't\nrap: it would come through the keyhole.\"  Liddy looked at the keyhole.\n\"But it sounds very much as though some one is trying to break into the\nhouse.\"\n\nLiddy was shivering violently.  I told her to get me my slippers and\nshe brought me a pair of kid gloves, so I found my things myself, and\nprepared to call Halsey.  As before, the night alarm had found the\nelectric lights gone: the hall, save for its night lamp, was in\ndarkness, as I went across to Halsey's room.  I hardly know what I\nfeared, but it was a relief to find him there, very sound asleep, and\nwith his door unlocked.\n\n\"Wake up, Halsey,\" I said, shaking him.\n\nHe stirred a little.  Liddy was half in and half out of the door,\nafraid as usual to be left alone, and not quite daring to enter. Her\nscruples seemed to fade, however, all at once.  She gave a suppressed\nyell, bolted into the room, and stood tightly clutching the foot-board\nof the bed.  Halsey was gradually waking.\n\n\"I've seen it,\" Liddy wailed.  \"A woman in white down the hall!\"\n\nI paid no attention.\n\n\"Halsey,\" I persevered, \"some one is breaking into the house. Get up,\nwon't you?\"\n\n\"It isn't our house,\" he said sleepily.  And then he roused to the\nexigency of the occasion.  \"All right, Aunt Ray,\" he said, still\nyawning.  \"If you'll let me get into something--\"\n\nIt was all I could do to get Liddy out of the room.  The demands of the\noccasion had no influence on her: she had seen the ghost, she\npersisted, and she wasn't going into the hall.  But I got her over to\nmy room at last, more dead than alive, and made her lie down on the bed.\n\nThe tappings, which seemed to have ceased for a while, had commenced\nagain, but they were fainter.  Halsey came over in a few minutes, and\nstood listening and trying to locate the sound.\n\n\"Give me my revolver, Aunt Ray,\" he said; and I got it--the one I had\nfound in the tulip bed--and gave it to him.  He saw Liddy there and\ndivined at once that Louise was alone.\n\n\"You let me attend to this fellow, whoever it is, Aunt Ray, and go to\nLouise, will you?  She may be awake and alarmed.\"\n\nSo in spite of her protests, I left Liddy alone and went back to the\neast wing.  Perhaps I went a little faster past the yawning blackness\nof the circular staircase; and I could hear Halsey creaking cautiously\ndown the main staircase.  The rapping, or pounding, had ceased, and the\nsilence was almost painful. And then suddenly, from apparently under my\nvery feet, there rose a woman's scream, a cry of terror that broke off\nas suddenly as it came.  I stood frozen and still.  Every drop of blood\nin my body seemed to leave the surface and gather around my heart.  In\nthe dead silence that followed it throbbed as if it would burst. More\ndead than alive, I stumbled into Louise's bedroom.  She was not there!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nIN THE EARLY MORNING\n\nI stood looking at the empty bed.  The coverings had been thrown back,\nand Louise's pink silk dressing-gown was gone from the foot, where it\nhad lain.  The night lamp burned dimly, revealing the emptiness of the\nplace.  I picked it up, but my hand shook so that I put it down again,\nand got somehow to the door.\n\nThere were voices in the hall and Gertrude came running toward me.\n\n\"What is it?\" she cried.  \"What was that sound?  Where is Louise?\"\n\n\"She is not in her room,\" I said stupidly.  \"I think--it was she--who\nscreamed.\"\n\nLiddy had joined us now, carrying a light.  We stood huddled together\nat the head of the circular staircase, looking down into its shadows.\nThere was nothing to be seen, and it was absolutely quiet down there.\nThen we heard Halsey running up the main staircase.  He came quickly\ndown the hall to where we were standing.\n\n\"There's no one trying to get in.  I thought I heard some one shriek.\nWho was it?\"\n\nOur stricken faces told him the truth.\n\n\"Some one screamed down there,\" I said.  \"And--and Louise is not in her\nroom.\"\n\nWith a jerk Halsey took the light from Liddy and ran down the circular\nstaircase.  I followed him, more slowly.  My nerves seemed to be in a\nstate of paralysis:  I could scarcely step.  At the foot of the stairs\nHalsey gave an exclamation and put down the light.\n\n\"Aunt Ray,\" he called sharply.\n\nAt the foot of the staircase, huddled in a heap, her head on the lower\nstair, was Louise Armstrong.  She lay limp and white, her dressing-gown\ndragging loose from one sleeve of her night-dress, and the heavy braid\nof her dark hair stretching its length a couple of steps above her\nhead, as if she had slipped down.\n\nShe was not dead: Halsey put her down on the floor, and began to rub\nher cold hands, while Gertrude and Liddy ran for stimulants. As for me,\nI sat there at the foot of that ghostly staircase--sat, because my\nknees wouldn't hold me--and wondered where it would all end.  Louise\nwas still unconscious, but she was breathing better, and I suggested\nthat we get her back to bed before she came to.  There was something\ngrisly and horrible to me, seeing her there in almost the same attitude\nand in the same place where we had found her brother's body.  And to\nadd to the similarity, just then the hall clock, far off, struck\nfaintly three o'clock.\n\nIt was four before Louise was able to talk, and the first rays of dawn\nwere coming through her windows, which faced the east, before she could\ntell us coherently what had occurred.  I give it as she told it.  She\nlay propped in bed, and Halsey sat beside her, unrebuffed, and held her\nhand while she talked.\n\n\"I was not sleeping well,\" she began, \"partly, I think, because I had\nslept during the afternoon.  Liddy brought me some hot milk at ten\no'clock and I slept until twelve.  Then I wakened and--I got to\nthinking about things, and worrying, so I could not go to sleep.\n\n\"I was wondering why I had not heard from Arnold since the--since I saw\nhim that night at the lodge.  I was afraid he was ill, because--he was\nto have done something for me, and he had not come back.  It must have\nbeen three when I heard some one rapping.  I sat up and listened, to be\nquite sure, and the rapping kept up.  It was cautious, and I was about\nto call Liddy.\n\n\"Then suddenly I thought I knew what it was.  The east entrance and the\ncircular staircase were always used by Arnold when he was out late, and\nsometimes, when he forgot his key, he would rap and I would go down and\nlet him in.  I thought he had come back to see me--I didn't think about\nthe time, for his hours were always erratic.  But I was afraid I was\ntoo weak to get down the stairs.\n\n\"The knocking kept up, and just as I was about to call Liddy, she ran\nthrough the room and out into the hall.  I got up then, feeling weak\nand dizzy, and put on my dressing-gown.  If it was Arnold, I knew I\nmust see him.\n\n\"It was very dark everywhere, but, of course, I knew my way.  I felt\nalong for the stair-rail, and went down as quickly as I could.  The\nknocking had stopped, and I was afraid I was too late.  I got to the\nfoot of the staircase and over to the door on to the east veranda.  I\nhad never thought of anything but that it was Arnold, until I reached\nthe door.  It was unlocked and opened about an inch.  Everything was\nblack: it was perfectly dark outside.  I felt very queer and shaky.\nThen I thought perhaps Arnold had used his key; he did--strange things\nsometimes, and I turned around.  Just as I reached the foot of the\nstaircase I thought I heard some one coming.  My nerves were going\nanyhow, there in the dark, and I could scarcely stand.  I got up as far\nas the third or fourth step; then I felt that some one was coming\ntoward me on the staircase.  The next instant a hand met mine on the\nstair-rail.  Some one brushed past me, and I screamed.  Then I must\nhave fainted.\"\n\nThat was Louise's story.  There could be no doubt of its truth, and the\nthing that made it inexpressibly awful to me was that the poor girl had\ncrept down to answer the summons of a brother who would never need her\nkindly offices again.  Twice now, without apparent cause, some one had\nentered the house by means of the east entrance: had apparently gone\nhis way unhindered through the house, and gone out again as he had\nentered.  Had this unknown visitor been there a third time, the night\nArnold Armstrong was murdered?  Or a fourth, the time Mr. Jamieson had\nlocked some one in the clothes chute?\n\nSleep was impossible, I think, for any of us.  We dispersed finally to\nbathe and dress, leaving Louise little the worse for her experience.\nBut I determined that before the day was over she must know the true\nstate of affairs.  Another decision I made, and I put it into execution\nimmediately after breakfast.  I had one of the unused bedrooms in the\neast wing, back along the small corridor, prepared for occupancy, and\nfrom that time on, Alex, the gardener, slept there.  One man in that\nbarn of a house was an absurdity, with things happening all the time,\nand I must say that Alex was as unobjectionable as any one could\npossibly have been.\n\nThe next morning, also, Halsey and I made an exhaustive examination of\nthe circular staircase, the small entry at its foot, and the card-room\nopening from it.  There was no evidence of anything unusual the night\nbefore, and had we not ourselves heard the rapping noises, I should\nhave felt that Louise's imagination had run away with her.  The outer\ndoor was closed and locked, and the staircase curved above us, for all\nthe world like any other staircase.\n\nHalsey, who had never taken seriously my account of the night Liddy and\nI were there alone, was grave enough now.  He examined the paneling of\nthe wainscoting above and below the stairs, evidently looking for a\nsecret door, and suddenly there flashed into my mind the recollection\nof a scrap of paper that Mr. Jamieson had found among Arnold\nArmstrong's effects.  As nearly as possible I repeated its contents to\nhim, while Halsey took them down in a note-book.\n\n\"I wish you had told me that before,\" he said, as he put the memorandum\ncarefully away.  We found nothing at all in the house, and I expected\nlittle from any examination of the porch and grounds.  But as we opened\nthe outer door something fell into the entry with a clatter.  It was a\ncue from the billiard-room.\n\nHalsey picked it up with an exclamation.\n\n\"That's careless enough,\" he said.  \"Some of the servants have been\namusing themselves.\"\n\nI was far from convinced.  Not one of the servants would go into that\nwing at night unless driven by dire necessity.  And a billiard cue!  As\na weapon of either offense or defense it was an absurdity, unless one\naccepted Liddy's hypothesis of a ghost, and even then, as Halsey\npointed out, a billiard-playing ghost would be a very modern evolution\nof an ancient institution.\n\nThat afternoon we, Gertrude, Halsey and I, attended the coroner's\ninquest in town.  Doctor Stewart had been summoned also, it transpiring\nthat in that early Sunday morning, when Gertrude and I had gone to our\nrooms, he had been called to view the body.  We went, the four of us,\nin the machine, preferring the execrable roads to the matinee train,\nwith half of Casanova staring at us. And on the way we decided to say\nnothing of Louise and her interview with her stepbrother the night he\ndied.  The girl was in trouble enough as it was.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nA HINT OF SCANDAL\n\nIn giving the gist of what happened at the inquest, I have only one\nexcuse--to recall to the reader the events of the night of Arnold\nArmstrong's murder.  Many things had occurred which were not brought\nout at the inquest and some things were told there that were new to me.\nAltogether, it was a gloomy affair, and the six men in the corner, who\nconstituted the coroner's jury, were evidently the merest puppets in\nthe hands of that all-powerful gentleman, the coroner.\n\nGertrude and I sat well back, with our veils down.  There were a number\nof people I knew: Barbara Fitzhugh, in extravagant mourning--she always\nwent into black on the slightest provocation, because it was\nbecoming--and Mr. Jarvis, the man who had come over from the Greenwood\nClub the night of the murder.  Mr. Harton was there, too, looking\nimpatient as the inquest dragged, but alive to every particle of\nevidence. From a corner Mr. Jamieson was watching the proceedings\nintently.\n\nDoctor Stewart was called first.  His evidence was told briefly, and\namounted to this: on the Sunday morning previous, at a quarter before\nfive, he had been called to the telephone.  The message was from a Mr.\nJarvis, who asked him to come at once to Sunnyside, as there had been\nan accident there, and Mr. Arnold Armstrong had been shot.  He had\ndressed hastily, gathered up some instruments, and driven to Sunnyside.\n\nHe was met by Mr. Jarvis, who took him at once to the east wing. There,\njust as he had fallen, was the body of Arnold Armstrong. There was no\nneed of the instruments: the man was dead.  In answer to the coroner's\nquestion--no, the body had not been moved, save to turn it over.  It\nlay at the foot of the circular staircase.  Yes, he believed death had\nbeen instantaneous.  The body was still somewhat warm and rigor mortis\nhad not set in. It occurred late in cases of sudden death.  No, he\nbelieved the probability of suicide might be eliminated; the wounds\ncould have been self-inflicted, but with difficulty, and there had been\nno weapon found.\n\nThe doctor's examination was over, but he hesitated and cleared his\nthroat.\n\n\"Mr. Coroner,\" he said, \"at the risk of taking up valuable time, I\nwould like to speak of an incident that may or may not throw some light\non this matter.\"\n\nThe audience was alert at once.\n\n\"Kindly proceed, Doctor,\" the coroner said.\n\n\"My home is in Englewood, two miles from Casanova,\" the doctor began.\n\"In the absence of Doctor Walker, a number of Casanova people have been\nconsulting me.  A month ago--five weeks, to be exact--a woman whom I\nhad never seen came to my office.  She was in deep mourning and kept\nher veil down, and she brought for examination a child, a boy of six.\nThe little fellow was ill; it looked like typhoid, and the mother was\nfrantic.  She wanted a permit to admit the youngster to the Children's\nHospital in town here, where I am a member of the staff, and I gave her\none.  The incident would have escaped me, but for a curious thing.  Two\ndays before Mr. Armstrong was shot, I was sent for to go to the Country\nClub: some one had been struck with a golf-ball that had gone wild.  It\nwas late when I left--I was on foot, and about a mile from the club, on\nthe Claysburg road, I met two people.  They were disputing violently,\nand I had no difficulty in recognizing Mr. Armstrong.  The woman,\nbeyond doubt, was the one who had consulted me about the child.\"\n\nAt this hint of scandal, Mrs. Ogden Fitzhugh sat up very straight.\nJamieson was looking slightly skeptical, and the coroner made a note.\n\n\"The Children's Hospital, you say, Doctor?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.  But the child, who was entered as Lucien Wallace, was taken away\nby his mother two weeks ago.  I have tried to trace them and failed.\"\n\nAll at once I remembered the telegram sent to Louise by some one signed\nF. L. W.--presumably Doctor Walker.  Could this veiled woman be the\nNina Carrington of the message?  But it was only idle speculation.  I\nhad no way of finding out, and the inquest was proceeding.\n\nThe report of the coroner's physician came next.  The post-mortem\nexamination showed that the bullet had entered the chest in the fourth\nleft intercostal space and had taken an oblique course downward and\nbackward, piercing both the heart and lungs. The left lung was\ncollapsed, and the exit point of the ball had been found in the muscles\nof the back to the left of the spinal column.  It was improbable that\nsuch a wound had been self-inflicted, and its oblique downward course\npointed to the fact that the shot had been fired from above.  In other\nwords, as the murdered man had been found dead at the foot of a\nstaircase, it was probable that the shot had been fired by some one\nhigher up on the stairs.  There were no marks of powder.  The bullet, a\nthirty-eight caliber, had been found in the dead man's clothing, and\nwas shown to the jury.\n\nMr. Jarvis was called next, but his testimony amounted to little.\n\nHe had been summoned by telephone to Sunnyside, had come over at once\nwith the steward and Mr. Winthrop, at present out of town. They had\nbeen admitted by the housekeeper, and had found the body lying at the\nfoot of the staircase.  He had made a search for a weapon, but there\nwas none around.  The outer entry door in the east wing had been\nunfastened and was open about an inch.\n\nI had been growing more and more nervous.  When the coroner called Mr.\nJohn Bailey, the room was filled with suppressed excitement.  Mr.\nJamieson went forward and spoke a few words to the coroner, who nodded.\nThen Halsey was called.\n\n\"Mr. Innes,\" the coroner said, \"will you tell under what circumstances\nyou saw Mr. Arnold Armstrong the night he died?\"\n\n\"I saw him first at the Country Club,\" Halsey said quietly.  He was\nrather pale, but very composed.  \"I stopped there with my automobile\nfor gasolene.  Mr. Armstrong had been playing cards. When I saw him\nthere, he was coming out of the card-room, talking to Mr. John Bailey.\"\n\n\"The nature of the discussion--was it amicable?\"\n\nHalsey hesitated.\n\n\"They were having a dispute,\" he said.  \"I asked Mr. Bailey to leave\nthe club with me and come to Sunnyside over Sunday.\"\n\n\"Isn't it a fact, Mr. Innes, that you took Mr. Bailey away from the\nclub-house because you were afraid there would be blows?\"\n\n\"The situation was unpleasant,\" Halsey said evasively.\n\n\"At that time had you any suspicion that the Traders' Bank had been\nwrecked?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What occurred next?\"\n\n\"Mr. Bailey and I talked in the billiard-room until two-thirty.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Arnold Armstrong came there, while you were talking?\"\n\n\"Yes.  He came about half-past two.  He rapped at the east door, and I\nadmitted him.\"\n\nThe silence in the room was intense.  Mr. Jamieson's eyes never left\nHalsey's face.\n\n\"Will you tell us the nature of his errand?\"\n\n\"He brought a telegram that had come to the club for Mr. Bailey.\"\n\n\"He was sober?\"\n\n\"Perfectly, at that time.  Not earlier.\"\n\n\"Was not his apparent friendliness a change from his former attitude?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I did not understand it.\"\n\n\"How long did he stay?\"\n\n\"About five minutes.  Then he left, by the east entrance.\"\n\n\"What occurred then?\"\n\n\"We talked for a few minutes, discussing a plan Mr. Bailey had in mind.\nThen I went to the stables, where I kept my car, and got it out.\"\n\n\"Leaving Mr. Bailey alone in the billiard-room?\"\n\nHalsey hesitated.\n\n\"My sister was there?\"\n\nMrs. Ogden Fitzhugh had the courage to turn and eye Gertrude through\nher lorgnon.\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"I took the car along the lower road, not to disturb the household.\nMr. Bailey came down across the lawn, through the hedge, and got into\nthe car on the road.\"\n\n\"Then you know nothing of Mr. Armstrong's movements after he left the\nhouse?\"\n\n\"Nothing.  I read of his death Monday evening for the first time.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bailey did not see him on his way across the lawn?\"\n\n\"I think not.  If he had seen him he would have spoken of it.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  That is all.  Miss Gertrude Innes.\"\n\nGertrude's replies were fully as concise as Halsey's.  Mrs. Fitzhugh\nsubjected her to a close inspection, commencing with her hat and ending\nwith her shoes.  I flatter myself she found nothing wrong with either\nher gown or her manner, but poor Gertrude's testimony was the reverse\nof comforting.  She had been summoned, she said, by her brother, after\nMr. Armstrong had gone.\n\nShe had waited in the billiard-room with Mr. Bailey, until the\nautomobile had been ready.  Then she had locked the door at the foot of\nthe staircase, and, taking a lamp, had accompanied Mr. Bailey to the\nmain entrance of the house, and had watched him cross the lawn.\nInstead of going at once to her room, she had gone back to the\nbilliard-room for something which had been left there.  The card-room\nand billiard-room were in darkness.  She had groped around, found the\narticle she was looking for, and was on the point of returning to her\nroom, when she had heard some one fumbling at the lock at the east\nouter door.  She had thought it was probably her brother, and had been\nabout to go to the door, when she heard it open.  Almost immediately\nthere was a shot, and she had run panic-stricken through the\ndrawing-room and had roused the house.\n\n\"You heard no other sound?\" the coroner asked.  \"There was no one with\nMr. Armstrong when he entered?\"\n\n\"It was perfectly dark.  There were no voices and I heard nothing.\nThere was just the opening of the door, the shot, and the sound of\nsomebody falling.\"\n\n\"Then, while you went through the drawing-room and up-stairs to alarm\nthe household, the criminal, whoever it was, could have escaped by the\neast door?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Thank you.  That will do.\"\n\nI flatter myself that the coroner got little enough out of me.  I saw\nMr. Jamieson smiling to himself, and the coroner gave me up, after a\ntime.  I admitted I had found the body, said I had not known who it was\nuntil Mr. Jarvis told me, and ended by looking up at Barbara Fitzhugh\nand saying that in renting the house I had not expected to be involved\nin any family scandal.  At which she turned purple.\n\nThe verdict was that Arnold Armstrong had met his death at the hands of\na person or persons unknown, and we all prepared to leave.  Barbara\nFitzhugh flounced out without waiting to speak to me, but Mr. Harton\ncame up, as I knew he would.\n\n\"You have decided to give up the house, I hope, Miss Innes,\" he said.\n\"Mrs. Armstrong has wired me again.\"\n\n\"I am not going to give it up,\" I maintained, \"until I understand some\nthings that are puzzling me.  The day that the murderer is discovered,\nI will leave.\"\n\n\"Then, judging by what I have heard, you will be back in the city very\nsoon,\" he said.  And I knew that he suspected the discredited cashier\nof the Traders' Bank.\n\nMr. Jamieson came up to me as I was about to leave the coroner's office.\n\n\"How is your patient?\" he asked with his odd little smile.\n\n\"I have no patient,\" I replied, startled.\n\n\"I will put it in a different way, then.  How is Miss Armstrong?\"\n\n\"She--she is doing very well,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Good,\" cheerfully.  \"And our ghost?  Is it laid?\"\n\n\"Mr. Jamieson,\" I said suddenly, \"I wish you would do one thing: I wish\nyou would come to Sunnyside and spend a few days there. The ghost is\nnot laid.  I want you to spend one night at least watching the circular\nstaircase.  The murder of Arnold Armstrong was a beginning, not an end.\"\n\nHe looked serious.\n\n\"Perhaps I can do it,\" he said.  \"I have been doing something else,\nbut--well, I will come out to-night.\"\n\nWe were very silent during the trip back to Sunnyside.  I watched\nGertrude closely and somewhat sadly.  To me there was one glaring flaw\nin her story, and it seemed to stand out for every one to see.  Arnold\nArmstrong had had no key, and yet she said she had locked the east\ndoor.  He must have been admitted from within the house; over and over\nI repeated it to myself.\n\nThat night, as gently as I could, I told Louise the story of her\nstepbrother's death.  She sat in her big, pillow-filled chair, and\nheard me through without interruption.  It was clear that she was\nshocked beyond words: if I had hoped to learn anything from her\nexpression, I had failed.  She was as much in the dark as we were.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nA HOLE IN THE WALL\n\nMy taking the detective out to Sunnyside raised an unexpected storm of\nprotest from Gertrude and Halsey.  I was not prepared for it, and I\nscarcely knew how to account for it.  To me Mr. Jamieson was far less\nformidable under my eyes where I knew what he was doing, than he was of\nin the city, twisting circumstances and motives to suit himself and\nlearning what he wished to know, about events at Sunnyside, in some\noccult way.  I was glad enough to have him there, when excitements\nbegan to come thick and fast.\n\nA new element was about to enter into affairs: Monday, or Tuesday at\nthe latest, would find Doctor Walker back in his green and white house\nin the village, and Louise's attitude to him in the immediate future\nwould signify Halsey's happiness or wretchedness, as it might turn out.\nThen, too, the return of her mother would mean, of course, that she\nwould have to leave us, and I had become greatly attached to her.\n\nFrom the day Mr. Jamieson came to Sunnyside there was a subtle change\nin Gertrude's manner to me.  It was elusive, difficult to analyze, but\nit was there.  She was no longer frank with me, although I think her\naffection never wavered.  At the time I laid the change to the fact\nthat I had forbidden all communication with John Bailey, and had\nrefused to acknowledge any engagement between the two.  Gertrude spent\nmuch of her time wandering through the grounds, or taking long\ncross-country walks.  Halsey played golf at the Country Club day after\nday, and after Louise left, as she did the following week, Mr. Jamieson\nand I were much together.  He played a fair game of cribbage, but he\ncheated at solitaire.\n\nThe night the detective arrived, Saturday, I had a talk with him.\n\nI told him of the experience Louise Armstrong had had the night before,\non the circular staircase, and about the man who had so frightened\nRosie on the drive.  I saw that he thought the information was\nimportant, and to my suggestion that we put an additional lock on the\neast wing door he opposed a strong negative.\n\n\"I think it probable,\" he said, \"that our visitor will be back again,\nand the thing to do is to leave things exactly as they are, to avoid\nrousing suspicion.  Then I can watch for at least a part of each night\nand probably Mr. Innes will help us out.  I would say as little to\nThomas as possible.  The old man knows more than he is willing to\nadmit.\"\n\nI suggested that Alex, the gardener, would probably be willing to help,\nand Mr. Jamieson undertook to make the arrangement.  For one night,\nhowever, Mr. Jamieson preferred to watch alone. Apparently nothing\noccurred.  The detective sat in absolute darkness on the lower step of\nthe stairs, dozing, he said afterwards, now and then.  Nothing could\npass him in either direction, and the door in the morning remained as\nsecurely fastened as it had been the night before.  And yet one of the\nmost inexplicable occurrences of the whole affair took place that very\nnight.\n\nLiddy came to my room on Sunday morning with a face as long as the\nmoral law.  She laid out my things as usual, but I missed her customary\ngarrulousness.  I was not regaled with the new cook's extravagance as\nto eggs, and she even forbore to mention \"that Jamieson,\" on whose\narrival she had looked with silent disfavor.\n\n\"What's the matter, Liddy?\" I asked at last.  \"Didn't you sleep last\nnight?\"\n\n\"No, ma'm,\" she said stiffly.\n\n\"Did you have two cups of coffee at your dinner?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No, ma'm,\" indignantly.\n\nI sat up and almost upset my hot water--I always take a cup of hot\nwater with a pinch of salt, before I get up.  It tones the stomach.\n\n\"Liddy Allen,\" I said, \"stop combing that switch and tell me what is\nwrong with you.\"\n\nLiddy heaved a sigh.\n\n\"Girl and woman,\" she said, \"I've been with you twenty-five years, Miss\nRachel, through good temper and bad--\" the idea! and what I have taken\nfrom her in the way of sulks!--\"but I guess I can't stand it any\nlonger.  My trunk's packed.\"\n\n\"Who packed it?\" I asked, expecting from her tone to be told she had\nwakened to find it done by some ghostly hand.\n\n\"I did; Miss Rachel, you won't believe me when I tell you this house is\nhaunted.  Who was it fell down the clothes chute? Who was it scared\nMiss Louise almost into her grave?\"\n\n\"I'm doing my best to find out,\" I said.  \"What in the world are you\ndriving at?\"  She drew a long breath.\n\n\"There is a hole in the trunk-room wall, dug out since last night.\nIt's big enough to put your head in, and the plaster's all over the\nplace.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said.  \"Plaster is always falling.\"\n\nBut Liddy clenched that.\n\n\"Just ask Alex,\" she said.  \"When he put the new cook's trunk there\nlast night the wall was as smooth as this.  This morning it's dug out,\nand there's plaster on the cook's trunk.  Miss Rachel, you can get a\ndozen detectives and put one on every stair in the house, and you'll\nnever catch anything.  There's some things you can't handcuff.\"\n\nLiddy was right.  As soon as I could, I went up to the trunk-room,\nwhich was directly over my bedroom.  The plan of the upper story of the\nhouse was like that of the second floor, in the main.  One end,\nhowever, over the east wing, had been left only roughly finished, the\nintention having been to convert it into a ball-room at some future\ntime.  The maids' rooms, trunk-room, and various store-rooms, including\na large airy linen-room, opened from a long corridor, like that on the\nsecond floor.  And in the trunk-room, as Liddy had said, was a fresh\nbreak in the plaster.\n\nNot only in the plaster, but through the lathing, the aperture\nextended.  I reached into the opening, and three feet away, perhaps, I\ncould touch the bricks of the partition wall.  For some reason, the\narchitect, in building the house, had left a space there that struck\nme, even in the surprise of the discovery, as an excellent place for a\nconflagration to gain headway.\n\n\"You are sure the hole was not here yesterday?\" I asked Liddy, whose\nexpression was a mixture of satisfaction and alarm.  In answer she\npointed to the new cook's trunk--that necessary adjunct of the\nmigratory domestic.  The top was covered with fine white plaster, as\nwas the floor.  But there were no large pieces of mortar lying\naround--no bits of lathing.  When I mentioned this to Liddy she merely\nraised her eyebrows.  Being quite confident that the gap was of unholy\norigin, she did not concern herself with such trifles as a bit of\nmortar and lath.  No doubt they were even then heaped neatly on a\ngravestone in the Casanova churchyard!\n\nI brought Mr. Jamieson up to see the hole in the wall, directly after\nbreakfast.  His expression was very odd when he looked at it, and the\nfirst thing he did was to try to discover what object, if any, such a\nhole could have.  He got a piece of candle, and by enlarging the\naperture a little was able to examine what lay beyond.  The result was\nnil.  The trunk-room, although heated by steam heat, like the rest of\nthe house, boasted of a fireplace and mantel as well.  The opening had\nbeen made between the flue and the outer wall of the house.  There was\nrevealed, however, on inspection, only the brick of the chimney on one\nside and the outer wall of the house on the other; in depth the space\nextended only to the flooring.  The breach had been made about four\nfeet from the floor, and inside were all the missing bits of plaster.\nIt had been a methodical ghost.\n\nIt was very much of a disappointment.  I had expected a secret room, at\nthe very least, and I think even Mr. Jamieson had fancied he might at\nlast have a clue to the mystery.  There was evidently nothing more to\nbe discovered: Liddy reported that everything was serene among the\nservants, and that none of them had been disturbed by the noise.  The\nmaddening thing, however, was that the nightly visitor had evidently\nmore than one way of gaining access to the house, and we made\narrangements to redouble our vigilance as to windows and doors that\nnight.\n\nHalsey was inclined to pooh-pooh the whole affair.  He said a break in\nthe plaster might have occurred months ago and gone unnoticed, and that\nthe dust had probably been stirred up the day before.  After all, we\nhad to let it go at that, but we put in an uncomfortable Sunday.\nGertrude went to church, and Halsey took a long walk in the morning.\nLouise was able to sit up, and she allowed Halsey and Liddy to assist\nher down-stairs late in the afternoon.  The east veranda was shady,\ngreen with vines and palms, cheerful with cushions and lounging chairs.\nWe put Louise in a steamer chair, and she sat there passively enough,\nher hands clasped in her lap.\n\nWe were very silent.  Halsey sat on the rail with a pipe, openly\nwatching Louise, as she looked broodingly across the valley to the\nhills.  There was something baffling in the girl's eyes; and gradually\nHalsey's boyish features lost their glow at seeing her about again, and\nsettled into grim lines.  He was like his father just then.\n\nWe sat until late afternoon, Halsey growing more and more moody.\nShortly before six, he got up and went into the house, and in a few\nminutes he came out and called me to the telephone.  It was Anna\nWhitcomb, in town, and she kept me for twenty minutes, telling me the\nchildren had had the measles, and how Madame Sweeny had botched her new\ngown.\n\nWhen I finished, Liddy was behind me, her mouth a thin line.\n\n\"I wish you would try to look cheerful, Liddy,\" I groaned, \"your face\nwould sour milk.\"  But Liddy seldom replied to my gibes. She folded her\nlips a little tighter.\n\n\"He called her up,\" she said oracularly, \"he called her up, and asked\nher to keep you at the telephone, so he could talk to Miss Louise. A\nTHANKLESS CHILD IS SHARPER THAN A SERPENT'S TOOTH.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said bruskly.  \"I might have known enough to leave them.\nIt's a long time since you and I were in love, Liddy, and--we forget.\"\n\nLiddy sniffed.\n\n\"No man ever made a fool of me,\" she replied virtuously.\n\n\"Well, something did,\" I retorted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nCONCERNING THOMAS\n\n\"Mr. Jamieson,\" I said, when we found ourselves alone after dinner that\nnight, \"the inquest yesterday seemed to me the merest recapitulation of\nthings that were already known.  It developed nothing new beyond the\nstory of Doctor Stewart's, and that was volunteered.\"\n\n\"An inquest is only a necessary formality, Miss Innes,\" he replied.\n\"Unless a crime is committed in the open, the inquest does nothing\nbeyond getting evidence from witnesses while events are still in their\nminds.  The police step in later.  You and I both know how many\nimportant things never transpired.  For instance: the dead man had no\nkey, and yet Miss Gertrude testified to a fumbling at the lock, and\nthen the opening of the door.  The piece of evidence you mention,\nDoctor Stewart's story, is one of those things we have to take\ncautiously: the doctor has a patient who wears black and does not raise\nher veil. Why, it is the typical mysterious lady!  Then the good doctor\ncomes across Arnold Armstrong, who was a graceless scamp--de\nmortuis--what's the rest of it?--and he is quarreling with a lady in\nblack.  Behold, says the doctor, they are one and the same.\"\n\n\"Why was Mr. Bailey not present at the inquest?\"\n\nThe detective's expression was peculiar.\n\n\"Because his physician testified that he is ill, and unable to leave\nhis bed.\"\n\n\"Ill!\" I exclaimed.  \"Why, neither Halsey nor Gertrude has told me\nthat.\"\n\n\"There are more things than that, Miss Innes, that are puzzling. Bailey\ngives the impression that he knew nothing of the crash at the bank\nuntil he read it in the paper Monday night, and that he went back and\nsurrendered himself immediately.  I do not believe it.  Jonas, the\nwatchman at the Traders' Bank, tells a different story.  He says that\non the Thursday night before, about eight-thirty, Bailey went back to\nthe bank.  Jonas admitted him, and he says the cashier was in a state\nalmost of collapse.  Bailey worked until midnight, then he closed the\nvault and went away. The occurrence was so unusual that the watchman\npondered over it an the rest of the night.  What did Bailey do when he\nwent back to the Knickerbocker apartments that night?  He packed a\nsuit-case ready for instant departure.  But he held off too long; he\nwaited for something.  My personal opinion is that he waited to see\nMiss Gertrude before flying from the country. Then, when he had shot\ndown Arnold Armstrong that night, he had to choose between two evils.\nHe did the thing that would immediately turn public opinion in his\nfavor, and surrendered himself, as an innocent man.  The strongest\nthing against him is his preparation for flight, and his deciding to\ncome back after the murder of Arnold Armstrong.  He was shrewd enough\nto disarm suspicion as to the graver charge?\"\n\nThe evening dragged along slowly.  Mrs. Watson came to my bedroom\nbefore I went to bed and asked if I had any arnica.  She showed me a\nbadly swollen hand, with reddish streaks running toward the elbow; she\nsaid it was the hand she had hurt the night of the murder a week\nbefore, and that she had not slept well since.  It looked to me as if\nit might be serious, and I told her to let Doctor Stewart see it.\n\nThe next morning Mrs. Watson went up to town on the eleven train, and\nwas admitted to the Charity Hospital.  She was suffering from\nblood-poisoning.  I fully meant to go up and see her there, but other\nthings drove her entirely from my mind.  I telephoned to the hospital\nthat day, however, and ordered a private room for her, and whatever\ncomforts she might be allowed.\n\nMrs. Armstrong arrived Monday evening with her husband's body, and the\nservices were set for the next day.  The house on Chestnut Street, in\ntown, had been opened, and Tuesday morning Louise left us to go home.\nShe sent for me before she went, and I saw she had been crying.\n\n\"How can I thank you, Miss Innes?\" she said.  \"You have taken me on\nfaith, and--you have not asked me any questions.  Some time, perhaps, I\ncan tell you; and when that time comes, you will all despise\nme,--Halsey, too.\"\n\nI tried to tell her how glad I was to have had her but there was\nsomething else she wanted to say.  She said it finally, when she had\nbade a constrained good-by to Halsey and the car was waiting at the\ndoor.\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" she said in a low tone, \"if they--if there is any attempt\nmade to--to have you give up the house, do it, if you possibly can.  I\nam afraid--to have you stay.\"\n\nThat was all.  Gertrude went into town with her and saw her safely\nhome.  She reported a decided coolness in the greeting between Louise\nand her mother, and that Doctor Walker was there, apparently in charge\nof the arrangements for the funeral.  Halsey disappeared shortly after\nLouise left and came home about nine that night, muddy and tired.  As\nfor Thomas, he went around dejected and sad, and I saw the detective\nwatching him closely at dinner.  Even now I wonder--what did Thomas\nknow?  What did he suspect?\n\nAt ten o'clock the household had settled down for the night. Liddy, who\nwas taking Mrs. Watson's place, had finished examining the tea-towels\nand the corners of the shelves in the cooling-room, and had gone to\nbed.  Alex, the gardener, had gone heavily up the circular staircase to\nhis room, and Mr. Jamieson was examining the locks of the windows.\nHalsey dropped into a chair in the living-room, and stared moodily\nahead.  Once he roused.\n\n\"What sort of a looking chap is that Walker, Gertrude?\" he asked!\n\n\"Rather tall, very dark, smooth-shaven.  Not bad looking,\" Gertrude\nsaid, putting down the book she had been pretending to read.  Halsey\nkicked a taboret viciously.\n\n\"Lovely place this village must be in the winter,\" he said\nirrelevantly.  \"A girl would be buried alive here.\"\n\nIt was then some one rapped at the knocker on the heavy front door.\nHalsey got up leisurely and opened it, admitting Warner. He was out of\nbreath from running, and he looked half abashed.\n\n\"I am sorry to disturb you,\" he said.  \"But I didn't know what else to\ndo.  It's about Thomas.\"\n\n\"What about Thomas?\" I asked.  Mr. Jamieson had come into the hall and\nwe all stared at Warner.\n\n\"He's acting queer,\" Warner explained.  \"He's sitting down there on the\nedge of the porch, and he says he has seen a ghost.  The old man looks\nbad, too; he can scarcely speak.\"\n\n\"He's as full of superstition as an egg is of meat,\" I said. \"Halsey,\nbring some whisky and we will all go down.\"\n\nNo one moved to get the whisky, from which I judged there were three\npocket flasks ready for emergency.  Gertrude threw a shawl around my\nshoulders, and we all started down over the hill: I had made so many\nnocturnal excursions around the place that I knew my way perfectly.\nBut Thomas was not on the veranda, nor was he inside the house.  The\nmen exchanged significant glances, and Warner got a lantern.\n\n\"He can't have gone far,\" he said.  \"He was trembling so that he\ncouldn't stand, when I left.\"\n\nJamieson and Halsey together made the round of the lodge, occasionally\ncalling the old man by name.  But there was no response.  No Thomas\ncame, bowing and showing his white teeth through the darkness.  I began\nto be vaguely uneasy, for the first time.  Gertrude, who was never\nnervous in the dark, went alone down the drive to the gate, and stood\nthere, looking along the yellowish line of the road, while I waited on\nthe tiny veranda.\n\nWarner was puzzled.  He came around to the edge of the veranda and\nstood looking at it as if it ought to know and explain.\n\n\"He might have stumbled into the house,\" he said, \"but he could not\nhave climbed the stairs.  Anyhow, he's not inside or outside, that I\ncan see.\"  The other members of the party had come back now, and no one\nhad found any trace of the old man.  His pipe, still warm, rested on\nthe edge of the rail, and inside on the table his old gray hat showed\nthat its owner had not gone far.\n\nHe was not far, after all.  From the table my eyes traveled around the\nroom, and stopped at the door of a closet.  I hardly know what impulse\nmoved me, but I went in and turned the knob. It burst open with the\nimpetus of a weight behind it, and something fell partly forward in a\nheap on the floor.  It was Thomas--Thomas without a mark of injury on\nhim, and dead.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nDOCTOR WALKER'S WARNING\n\nWarner was on his knees in a moment, fumbling at the old man's collar\nto loosen it, but Halsey caught his hand.\n\n\"Let him alone?\" he said.  \"You can't help him; he is dead.\"\n\nWe stood there, each avoiding the other's eyes; we spoke low and\nreverently in the presence of death, and we tacitly avoided any mention\nof the suspicion that was in every mind.  When Mr. Jamieson had\nfinished his cursory examination, he got up and dusted the knees of his\ntrousers.\n\n\"There is no sign of injury,\" he said, and I know I, for one, drew a\nlong breath of relief.  \"From what Warner says and from his hiding in\nthe closet, I should say he was scared to death. Fright and a weak\nheart, together.\"\n\n\"But what could have done it?\" Gertrude asked.  \"He was all right this\nevening at dinner.  Warner, what did he say when you found him on the\nporch?\"\n\nWarner looked shaken: his honest, boyish face was colorless.\n\n\"Just what I told you, Miss Innes.  He'd been reading the paper\ndown-stairs; I had put up the car, and, feeling sleepy, I came down to\nthe lodge to go to bed.  As I went up-stairs, Thomas put down the paper\nand, taking his pipe, went out on the porch. Then I heard an\nexclamation from him.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" demanded Jamieson.\n\n\"I couldn't hear, but his voice was strange; it sounded startled.  I\nwaited for him to call out again, but he did not, so I went\ndown-stairs.  He was sitting on the porch step, looking straight ahead,\nas if he saw something among the trees across the road.  And he kept\nmumbling about having seen a ghost.  He looked queer, and I tried to\nget him inside, but he wouldn't move.  Then I thought I'd better go up\nto the house.\"\n\n\"Didn't he say anything else you could understand?\" I asked.\n\n\"He said something about the grave giving up its dead.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson was going through the old man's pockets, and Gertrude was\ncomposing his arms, folding them across his white shirt-bosom, always\nso spotless.\n\nMr. Jamieson looked up at me.\n\n\"What was that you said to me, Miss Innes, about the murder at the\nhouse being a beginning and not an end?  By jove, I believe you were\nright!\"\n\nIn the course of his investigations the detective had come to the inner\npocket of the dead butler's black coat.  Here he found some things that\ninterested him.  One was a small flat key, with a red cord tied to it,\nand the other was a bit of white paper, on which was written something\nin Thomas' cramped hand.  Mr. Jamieson read it: then he gave it to me.\nIt was an address in fresh ink--\n\n            LUCIEN WALLACE, 14 Elm Street, Richfield.\n\nAs the card went around, I think both the detective and I watched for\nany possible effect it might have, but, beyond perplexity, there seemed\nto be none.\n\n\"Richfield!\" Gertrude exclaimed.  \"Why, Elm Street is the main street;\ndon't you remember, Halsey?\"\n\n\"Lucien Wallace!\" Halsey said.  \"That is the child Stewart spoke of at\nthe inquest.\"\n\nWarner, with his mechanic's instinct, had reached for the key. What he\nsaid was not a surprise.\n\n\"Yale lock,\" he said.  \"Probably a key to the east entry.\"\n\nThere was no reason why Thomas, an old and trusted servant, should not\nhave had a key to that particular door, although the servants' entry\nwas in the west wing.  But I had not known of this key, and it opened\nup a new field of conjecture.  Just now, however, there were many\nthings to be attended to, and, leaving Warner with the body, we all\nwent back to the house.  Mr. Jamieson walked with me, while Halsey and\nGertrude followed.\n\n\"I suppose I shall have to notify the Armstrongs,\" I said.  \"They will\nknow if Thomas had any people and how to reach them.  Of course, I\nexpect to defray the expenses of the funeral, but his relatives must be\nfound.  What do you think frightened him, Mr. Jamieson?\"\n\n\"It is hard to say,\" he replied slowly, \"but I think we may be certain\nit was fright, and that he was hiding from something.  I am sorry in\nmore than one way:  I have always believed that Thomas knew something,\nor suspected something, that he would not tell.  Do you know how much\nmoney there was in that worn-out wallet of his?  Nearly a hundred\ndollars!  Almost two months' wages--and yet those darkies seldom have a\npenny.  Well--what Thomas knew will be buried with him.\"\n\nHalsey suggested that the grounds be searched, but Mr. Jamieson vetoed\nthe suggestion.\n\n\"You would find nothing,\" he said.  \"A person clever enough to get into\nSunnyside and tear a hole in the wall, while I watched down-stairs, is\nnot to be found by going around the shrubbery with a lantern.\"\n\nWith the death of Thomas, I felt that a climax had come in affairs at\nSunnyside.  The night that followed was quiet enough. Halsey watched at\nthe foot of the staircase, and a complicated system of bolts on the\nother doors seemed to be effectual.\n\nOnce in the night I wakened and thought I heard the tapping again.  But\nall was quiet, and I had reached the stage where I refused to be\ndisturbed for minor occurrences.\n\nThe Armstrongs were notified of Thomas' death, and I had my first\ninterview with Doctor Walker as a result.  He came up early the next\nmorning, just as we finished breakfast, in a professional looking car\nwith a black hood.  I found him striding up and down the living-room,\nand, in spite of my preconceived dislike, I had to admit that the man\nwas presentable.  A big fellow he was, tall and dark, as Gertrude had\nsaid, smooth-shaven and erect, with prominent features and a square\njaw.  He was painfully spruce in his appearance, and his manner was\nalmost obtrusively polite.\n\n\"I must make a double excuse for this early visit, Miss Innes,\" he said\nas he sat down.  The chair was lower than he expected, and his dignity\nrequired collecting before he went on.  \"My professional duties are\nurgent and long neglected, and\"--a fall to the every-day\nmanner--\"something must be done about that body.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, sitting on the edge of my chair.  \"I merely wished the\naddress of Thomas' people.  You might have telephoned, if you were\nbusy.\"\n\nHe smiled.\n\n\"I wished to see you about something else,\" he said.  \"As for Thomas,\nit is Mrs. Armstrong's wish that you would allow her to attend to the\nexpense.  About his relatives, I have already notified his brother, in\nthe village.  It was heart disease, I think.  Thomas always had a bad\nheart.\"\n\n\"Heart disease and fright,\" I said, still on the edge of my chair.  But\nthe doctor had no intention of leaving.\n\n\"I understand you have a ghost up here, and that you have the house\nfilled with detectives to exorcise it,\" he said.\n\nFor some reason I felt I was being \"pumped,\" as Halsey says. \"You have\nbeen misinformed,\" I replied.\n\n\"What, no ghost, no detectives!\" he said, still with his smile. \"What a\ndisappointment to the village!\"\n\nI resented his attempt at playfulness.  It had been anything but a joke\nto us.\n\n\"Doctor Walker,\" I said tartly, \"I fail to see any humor in the\nsituation.  Since I came here, one man has been shot, and another one\nhas died from shock.  There have been intruders in the house, and\nstrange noises.  If that is funny, there is something wrong with my\nsense of humor.\"\n\n\"You miss the point,\" he said, still good-naturedly.  \"The thing that\nis funny, to me, is that you insist on remaining here, under the\ncircumstances.  I should think nothing would keep you.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken.  Everything that occurs only confirms my resolution\nto stay until the mystery is cleared.\"\n\n\"I have a message for you, Miss Innes,\" he said, rising at last.  \"Mrs.\nArmstrong asked me to thank you for your kindness to Louise, whose\nwhim, occurring at the time it did, put her to great inconvenience.\nAlso--and this is a delicate matter--she asked me to appeal to your\nnatural sympathy for her, at this time, and to ask you if you will not\nreconsider your decision about the house.  Sunnyside is her home; she\nloves it dearly, and just now she wishes to retire here for quiet and\npeace.\"\n\n\"She must have had a change of heart,\" I said, ungraciously enough.\n\"Louise told me her mother despised the place.  Besides, this is no\nplace for quiet and peace just now.  Anyhow, doctor, while I don't care\nto force an issue, I shall certainly remain here, for a time at least.\"\n\n\"For how long?\" he asked.\n\n\"My lease is for six months.  I shall stay until some explanation is\nfound for certain things.  My own family is implicated now, and I shall\ndo everything to clear the mystery of Arnold Armstrong's murder.\"\n\nThe doctor stood looking down, slapping his gloves thoughtfully against\nthe palm of a well-looked-after hand.\n\n\"You say there have been intruders in the house?\" he asked. \"You are\nsure of that, Miss Innes?\"\n\n\"Certain.\"\n\n\"In what part?\"\n\n\"In the east wing.\"\n\n\"Can you tell me when these intrusions occurred, and what the purpose\nseemed to be?  Was it robbery?\"\n\n\"No,\" I said decidedly.  \"As to time, once on Friday night a week ago,\nagain the following night, when Arnold Armstrong was murdered, and\nagain last Friday night.\"\n\nThe doctor looked serious.  He seemed to be debating some question in\nhis mind, and to reach a decision.\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said, \"I am in a peculiar position; I understand your\nattitude, of course; but--do you think you are wise?  Ever since you\nhave come here there have been hostile demonstrations against you and\nyour family.  I'm not a croaker, but--take a warning.  Leave before\nanything occurs that will cause you a lifelong regret.\"\n\n\"I am willing to take the responsibility,\" I said coldly.\n\nI think he gave me up then as a poor proposition.  He asked to be shown\nwhere Arnold Armstrong's body had been found, and I took him there.  He\nscrutinized the whole place carefully, examining the stairs and the\nlock.  When he had taken a formal farewell I was confident of one\nthing.  Doctor Walker would do anything he could to get me away from\nSunnyside.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nFOURTEEN ELM STREET\n\nIt was Monday evening when we found the body of poor old Thomas. Monday\nnight had been uneventful; things were quiet at the house and the\npeculiar circumstances of the old man's death had been carefully kept\nfrom the servants.  Rosie took charge of the dining-room and pantry, in\nthe absence of a butler, and, except for the warning of the Casanova\ndoctor, everything breathed of peace.\n\nAffairs at the Traders' Bank were progressing slowly.  The failure had\nhit small stock-holders very hard, the minister of the little Methodist\nchapel in Casanova among them.  He had received as a legacy from an\nuncle a few shares of stock in the Traders' Bank, and now his joy was\nturned to bitterness: he had to sacrifice everything he had in the\nworld, and his feeling against Paul Armstrong, dead, as he was, must\nhave been bitter in the extreme.  He was asked to officiate at the\nsimple services when the dead banker's body was interred in Casanova\nchurchyard, but the good man providentially took cold, and a substitute\nwas called in.\n\nA few days after the services he called to see me, a kind-faced little\nman, in a very bad frock-coat and laundered tie.  I think he was\nuncertain as to my connection with the Armstrong family, and dubious\nwhether I considered Mr. Armstrong's taking away a matter for\ncondolence or congratulation.  He was not long in doubt.\n\nI liked the little man.  He had known Thomas well, and had promised to\nofficiate at the services in the rickety African Zion Church.  He told\nme more of himself than he knew, and before he left, I astonished\nhim--and myself, I admit--by promising a new carpet for his church.  He\nwas much affected, and I gathered that he had yearned over his ragged\nchapel as a mother over a half-clothed child.\n\n\"You are laying up treasure, Miss Innes,\" he said brokenly, \"where\nneither moth nor rust corrupt, nor thieves break through and steal.\"\n\n\"It is certainly a safer place than Sunnyside,\" I admitted.  And the\nthought of the carpet permitted him to smile.  He stood just inside the\ndoorway, looking from the luxury of the house to the beauty of the view.\n\n\"The rich ought to be good,\" he said wistfully.  \"They have so much\nthat is beautiful, and beauty is ennobling.  And yet--while I ought to\nsay nothing but good of the dead--Mr. Armstrong saw nothing of this\nfair prospect.  To him these trees and lawns were not the work of God.\nThey were property, at so much an acre.  He loved money, Miss Innes.\nHe offered up everything to his golden calf.  Not power, not ambition,\nwas his fetish: it was money.\" Then he dropped his pulpit manner, and,\nturning to me with his engaging smile:  \"In spite of all this luxury,\"\nhe said, \"the country people here have a saying that Mr. Paul Armstrong\ncould sit on a dollar and see all around it.  Unlike the summer people,\nhe gave neither to the poor nor to the church.  He loved money for its\nown sake.\"\n\n\"And there are no pockets in shrouds!\" I said cynically.\n\nI sent him home in the car, with a bunch of hot-house roses for his\nwife, and he was quite overwhelmed.  As for me, I had a generous glow\nthat was cheap at the price of a church carpet.  I received less\ngratification--and less gratitude--when I presented the new silver\ncommunion set to St. Barnabas.\n\nI had a great many things to think about in those days.  I made out a\nlist of questions and possible answers, but I seemed only to be working\naround in a circle.  I always ended where I began. The list was\nsomething like this:\n\n\nWho had entered the house the night before the murder?\n\nThomas claimed it was Mr. Bailey, whom he had seen on the foot-path,\nand who owned the pearl cuff-link.\n\nWhy did Arnold Armstrong come back after he had left the house the\nnight he was killed?\n\nNo answer.  Was it on the mission Louise had mentioned?\n\nWho admitted him?\n\nGertrude said she had locked the east entry.  There was no key on the\ndead man or in the door.  He must have been admitted from within.\n\nWho had been locked in the clothes chute?\n\nSome one unfamiliar with the house, evidently.  Only two people missing\nfrom the household, Rosie and Gertrude.  Rosie had been at the lodge.\nTherefore--but was it Gertrude?  Might it not have been the mysterious\nintruder again?\n\nWho had accosted Rosie on the drive?\n\nAgain--perhaps the nightly visitor.  It seemed more likely some one who\nsuspected a secret at the lodge.  Was Louise under surveillance?\n\nWho had passed Louise on the circular staircase?\n\nCould it have been Thomas?  The key to the east entry made this a\npossibility.  But why was he there, if it were indeed he?\n\nWho had made the hole in the trunk-room wall?\n\nIt was not vandalism.  It had been done quietly, and with deliberate\npurpose.  If I had only known how to read the purpose of that gaping\naperture what I might have saved in anxiety and mental strain!\n\nWhy had Louise left her people and come home to hide at the lodge?\n\nThere was no answer, as yet, to this, or to the next questions.\n\nWhy did both she and Doctor Walker warn us away from the house?\n\nWho was Lucien Wallace?\n\nWhat did Thomas see in the shadows the night he died?\n\nWhat was the meaning of the subtle change in Gertrude?\n\nWas Jack Bailey an accomplice or a victim in the looting of the\nTraders' Bank?\n\nWhat all-powerful reason made Louise determine to marry Doctor Walker?\n\n\nThe examiners were still working on the books of the Traders' Bank, and\nit was probable that several weeks would elapse before everything was\ncleared up.  The firm of expert accountants who had examined the books\nsome two months before testified that every bond, every piece of\nvaluable paper, was there at that time.  It had been shortly after\ntheir examination that the president, who had been in bad health, had\ngone to California. Mr. Bailey was still ill at the Knickerbocker, and\nin this, as in other ways, Gertrude's conduct puzzled me.  She seemed\nindifferent, refused to discuss matters pertaining to the bank, and\nnever, to my knowledge, either wrote to him or went to see him.\n\nGradually I came to the conclusion that Gertrude, with the rest of the\nworld, believed her lover guilty, and--although I believed it myself,\nfor that matter--I was irritated by her indifference. Girls in my day\ndid not meekly accept the public's verdict as to the man they loved.\n\nBut presently something occurred that made me think that under\nGertrude's surface calm there was a seething flood of emotions.\n\nTuesday morning the detective made a careful search of the grounds, but\nhe found nothing.  In the afternoon he disappeared, and it was late\nthat night when he came home.  He said he would have to go back to the\ncity the following day, and arranged with Halsey and Alex to guard the\nhouse.\n\nLiddy came to me on Wednesday morning with her black silk apron held up\nlike a bag, and her eyes big with virtuous wrath.  It was the day of\nThomas' funeral in the village, and Alex and I were in the conservatory\ncutting flowers for the old man's casket.  Liddy is never so happy as\nwhen she is making herself wretched, and now her mouth drooped while\nher eyes were triumphant.\n\n\"I always said there were plenty of things going on here, right under\nour noses, that we couldn't see,\" she said, holding out her apron.\n\n\"I don't see with my nose,\" I remarked.  \"What have you got there?\"\n\nLiddy pushed aside a half-dozen geranium pots, and in the space thus\ncleared she dumped the contents of her apron--a handful of tiny bits of\npaper.  Alex had stepped back, but I saw him watching her curiously.\n\n\"Wait a moment, Liddy,\" I said.  \"You have been going through the\nlibrary paper-basket again!\"\n\nLiddy was arranging her bits of paper with the skill of long practice\nand paid no attention.\n\n\"Did it ever occur to you,\" I went on, putting my hand over the scraps,\n\"that when people tear up their correspondence, it is for the express\npurpose of keeping it from being read?\"\n\n\"If they wasn't ashamed of it they wouldn't take so much trouble, Miss\nRachel,\" Liddy said oracularly.  \"More than that, with things happening\nevery day, I consider it my duty.  If you don't read and act on this, I\nshall give it to that Jamieson, and I'll venture he'll not go back to\nthe city to-day.\"\n\nThat decided me.  If the scraps had anything to do with the mystery\nordinary conventions had no value.  So Liddy arranged the scraps, like\nworking out one of the puzzle-pictures children play with, and she did\nit with much the same eagerness.  When it was finished she stepped\naside while I read it.\n\n\"Wednesday night, nine o'clock.  Bridge,\" I real aloud.  Then, aware of\nAlex's stare, I turned on Liddy.\n\n\"Some one is to play bridge to-night at nine o'clock,\" I said. \"Is that\nyour business, or mine?\"\n\nLiddy was aggrieved.  She was about to reply when I scooped up the\npieces and left the conservatory.\n\n\"Now then,\" I said, when we got outside, \"will you tell me why you\nchoose to take Alex into your confidence?  He's no fool.  Do you\nsuppose he thinks any one in this house is going to play bridge\nto-night at nine o'clock, by appointment!  I suppose you have shown it\nin the kitchen, and instead of my being able to slip down to the bridge\nto-night quietly, and see who is there, the whole household will be\ngoing in a procession.\"\n\n\"Nobody knows it,\" Liddy said humbly.  \"I found it in the basket in\nMiss Gertrude's dressing-room.  Look at the back of the sheet.\"  I\nturned over some of the scraps, and, sure enough, it was a blank\ndeposit slip from the Traders' Bank.  So Gertrude was going to meet\nJack Bailey that night by the bridge!  And I had thought he was ill!\nIt hardly seemed like the action of an innocent man--this avoidance of\ndaylight, and of his fiancee's people.  I decided to make certain,\nhowever, by going to the bridge that night.\n\nAfter luncheon Mr. Jamieson suggested that I go with him to Richfield,\nand I consented.\n\n\"I am inclined to place more faith in Doctor Stewart's story,\" he said,\n\"since I found that scrap in old Thomas' pocket.  It bears out the\nstatement that the woman with the child, and the woman who quarreled\nwith Armstrong, are the same.  It looks as if Thomas had stumbled on to\nsome affair which was more or less discreditable to the dead man, and,\nwith a certain loyalty to the family, had kept it to himself.  Then,\nyou see, your story about the woman at the card-room window begins to\nmean something.  It is the nearest approach to anything tangible that\nwe have had yet.\"\n\nWarner took us to Richfield in the car.  It was about twenty-five miles\nby railroad, but by taking a series of atrociously rough short cuts we\ngot there very quickly.  It was a pretty little town, on the river, and\nback on the hill I could see the Mortons' big country house, where\nHalsey and Gertrude had been staying until the night of the murder.\n\nElm Street was almost the only street, and number fourteen was easily\nfound.  It was a small white house, dilapidated without having gained\nanything picturesque, with a low window and a porch only a foot or so\nabove the bit of a lawn.  There was a baby-carriage in the path, and\nfrom a swing at the side came the sound of conflict.  Three small\nchildren were disputing vociferously, and a faded young woman with a\nkindly face was trying to hush the clamor.  When she saw us she untied\nher gingham apron and came around to the porch.\n\n\"Good afternoon,\" I said.  Jamieson lifted his hat, without speaking.\n\"I came to inquire about a child named Lucien Wallace.\"\n\n\"I am glad you have come,\" she said.  \"In spite of the other children,\nI think the little fellow is lonely.  We thought perhaps his mother\nwould be here to-day.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson stepped forward.\n\n\"You are Mrs. Tate?\" I wondered how the detective knew.\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Tate, we want to make some inquiries.  Perhaps in the house--\"\n\n\"Come right in,\" she said hospitably.  And soon we were in the little\nshabby parlor, exactly like a thousand of its prototypes. Mrs. Tate sat\nuneasily, her hands folded in her lap.\n\n\"How long has Lucien been here?\" Mr. Jamieson asked.\n\n\"Since a week ago last Friday.  His mother paid one week's board in\nadvance; the other has not been paid.\"\n\n\"Was he ill when he came?\"\n\n\"No, sir, not what you'd call sick.  He was getting better of typhoid,\nshe said, and he's picking up fine.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me his mother's name and address?\"\n\n\"That's the trouble,\" the young woman said, knitting her brows. \"She\ngave her name as Mrs. Wallace, and said she had no address. She was\nlooking for a boarding-house in town.  She said she worked in a\ndepartment store, and couldn't take care of the child properly, and he\nneeded fresh air and milk.  I had three children of my own, and one\nmore didn't make much difference in the work, but--I wish she would pay\nthis week's board.\"\n\n\"Did she say what store it was?\"\n\n\"No, sir, but all the boy's clothes came from King's.  He has far too\nfine clothes for the country.\"\n\nThere was a chorus of shouts and shrill yells from the front door,\nfollowed by the loud stamping of children's feet and a throaty \"whoa,\nwhoa!\"  Into the room came a tandem team of two chubby youngsters, a\nboy and a girl, harnessed with a clothes-line, and driven by a laughing\nboy of about seven, in tan overalls and brass buttons.  The small\ndriver caught my attention at once: he was a beautiful child, and,\nalthough he showed traces of recent severe illness, his skin had now\nthe clear transparency of health.\n\n\"Whoa, Flinders,\" he shouted.  \"You're goin' to smash the trap.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson coaxed him over by holding out a lead-pencil, striped blue\nand yellow.\n\n\"Now, then,\" he said, when the boy had taken the lead-pencil and was\ntesting its usefulness on the detective's cuff, \"now then, I'll bet you\ndon't know what your name is!\"\n\n\"I do,\" said the boy.  \"Lucien Wallace.\"\n\n\"Great!  And what's your mother's name?\"\n\n\"Mother, of course.  What's your mother's name?\"  And he pointed to me!\nI am going to stop wearing black: it doubles a woman's age.\n\n\"And where did you live before you came here?\"  The detective was\npolite enough not to smile.\n\n\"Grossmutter,\" he said.  And I saw Mr. Jamieson's eyebrows go up.\n\n\"German,\" he commented.  \"Well, young man, you don't seem to know much\nabout yourself.\"\n\n\"I've tried it all week,\" Mrs. Tate broke in.  \"The boy knows a word or\ntwo of German, but he doesn't know where he lived, or anything about\nhimself.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson wrote something on a card and gave it to her.\n\n\"Mrs. Tate,\" he said, \"I want you to do something.  Here is some money\nfor the telephone call.  The instant the boy's mother appears here,\ncall up that number and ask for the person whose name is there.  You\ncan run across to the drug-store on an errand and do it quietly.  Just\nsay, 'The lady has come.'\"\n\n\"'The lady has come,'\" repeated Mrs. Tate.  \"Very well, sir, and I hope\nit will be soon.  The milk-bill alone is almost double what it was.\"\n\n\"How much is the child's board?\" I asked.\n\n\"Three dollars a week, including his washing.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said.  \"Now, Mrs. Tate, I am going to pay last week's\nboard and a week in advance.  If the mother comes, she is to know\nnothing of this visit--absolutely not a word, and, in return for your\nsilence, you may use this money for--something for your own children.\"\n\nHer tired, faded face lighted up, and I saw her glance at the little\nTates' small feet.  Shoes, I divined--the feet of the genteel poor\nbeing almost as expensive as their stomachs.\n\nAs we went back Mr. Jamieson made only one remark:  I think he was\nlaboring under the weight of a great disappointment.\n\n\"Is King's a children's outfitting place?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not especially.  It is a general department store.\"\n\nHe was silent after that, but he went to the telephone as soon as we\ngot home, and called up King and Company, in the city.\n\nAfter a time he got the general manager, and they talked for some time.\nWhen Mr. Jamieson hung up the receiver he turned to me.\n\n\"The plot thickens,\" he said with his ready smile.  \"There are four\nwomen named Wallace at King's none of them married, and none over\ntwenty.  I think I shall go up to the city to-night. I want to go to\nthe Children's Hospital.  But before I go, Miss Innes, I wish you would\nbe more frank with me than you have been yet.  I want you to show me\nthe revolver you picked up in the tulip bed.\"\n\nSo he had known all along!\n\n\"It WAS a revolver, Mr. Jamieson,\" I admitted, cornered at last, \"but I\ncan not show it to you.  It is not in my possession.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nA LADDER OUT OF PLACE\n\nAt dinner Mr. Jamieson suggested sending a man out in his place for a\ncouple of days, but Halsey was certain there would be nothing more, and\nfelt that he and Alex could manage the situation.  The detective went\nback to town early in the evening, and by nine o'clock Halsey, who had\nbeen playing golf--as a man does anything to take his mind away from\ntrouble--was sleeping soundly on the big leather davenport in the\nliving-room.\n\nI sat and knitted, pretending not to notice when Gertrude got up and\nwandered out into the starlight.  As soon as I was satisfied that she\nhad gone, however, I went out cautiously.  I had no intention of\neavesdropping, but I wanted to be certain that it was Jack Bailey she\nwas meeting.  Too many things had occurred in which Gertrude was, or\nappeared to be, involved, to allow anything to be left in question.\n\nI went slowly across the lawn, skirted the hedge to a break not far\nfrom the lodge, and found myself on the open road.  Perhaps a hundred\nfeet to the left the path led across the valley to the Country Club,\nand only a little way off was the foot-bridge over Casanova Creek.  But\njust as I was about to turn down the path I heard steps coming toward\nme, and I shrank into the bushes.  It was Gertrude, going back quickly\ntoward the house.\n\nI was surprised.  I waited until she had had time to get almost to the\nhouse before I started.  And then I stepped back again into the\nshadows.  The reason why Gertrude had not kept her tryst was evident.\nLeaning on the parapet of the bridge in the moonlight, and smoking a\npipe, was Alex, the gardener.  I could have throttled Liddy for her\ncarelessness in reading the torn note where he could hear.  And I could\ncheerfully have choked Alex to death for his audacity.\n\nBut there was no help for it: I turned and followed Gertrude slowly\nback to the house.\n\nThe frequent invasions of the house had effectually prevented any\nrelaxation after dusk.  We had redoubled our vigilance as to bolts and\nwindow-locks but, as Mr. Jamieson had suggested, we allowed the door at\nthe east entry to remain as before, locked by the Yale lock only.  To\nprovide only one possible entrance for the invader, and to keep a\nconstant guard in the dark at the foot of the circular staircase,\nseemed to be the only method.\n\nIn the absence of the detective, Alex and Halsey arranged to change\noff, Halsey to be on duty from ten to two, and Alex from two until six.\nEach man was armed, and, as an additional precaution, the one off duty\nslept in a room near the head of the circular staircase and kept his\ndoor open, to be ready for emergency.\n\nThese arrangements were carefully kept from the servants, who were only\ncommencing to sleep at night, and who retired, one and all, with barred\ndoors and lamps that burned full until morning.\n\nThe house was quiet again Wednesday night.  It was almost a week since\nLouise had encountered some one on the stairs, and it was four days\nsince the discovery of the hole in the trunk-room wall.\n\nArnold Armstrong and his father rested side by side in the Casanova\nchurchyard, and at the Zion African Church, on the hill, a new mound\nmarked the last resting-place of poor Thomas.\n\n\nLouise was with her mother in town, and, beyond a polite note of thanks\nto me, we had heard nothing from her.  Doctor Walker had taken up his\npractice again, and we saw him now and then flying past along the road,\nalways at top speed.  The murder of Arnold Armstrong was still\nunavenged, and I remained firm in the position I had taken--to stay at\nSunnyside until the thing was at least partly cleared.\n\nAnd yet, for all its quiet, it was on Wednesday night that perhaps the\nboldest attempt was made to enter the house.  On Thursday afternoon the\nlaundress sent word she would like to speak to me, and I saw her in my\nprivate sitting-room, a small room beyond the dressing-room.\n\nMary Anne was embarrassed.  She had rolled down her sleeves and tied a\nwhite apron around her waist, and she stood making folds in it with\nfingers that were red and shiny from her soap-suds.\n\n\"Well, Mary,\" I said encouragingly, \"what's the matter?  Don't dare to\ntell me the soap is out.\"\n\n\"No, ma'm, Miss Innes.\"  She had a nervous habit of looking first at my\none eye and then at the other, her own optics shifting ceaselessly,\nright eye, left eye, right eye, until I found myself doing the same\nthing.  \"No, ma'm.  I was askin' did you want the ladder left up the\nclothes chute?\"\n\n\"The what?\" I screeched, and was sorry the next minute.  Seeing her\nsuspicions were verified, Mary Anne had gone white, and stood with her\neyes shifting more wildly than ever.\n\n\"There's a ladder up the clothes chute, Miss Innes,\" she said. \"It's up\nthat tight I can't move it, and I didn't like to ask for help until I\nspoke to you.\"\n\nIt was useless to dissemble; Mary Anne knew now as well as I did that\nthe ladder had no business to be there.  I did the best I could,\nhowever.  I put her on the defensive at once.\n\n\"Then you didn't lock the laundry last night?\"\n\n\"I locked it tight, and put the key in the kitchen on its nail.\"\n\n\"Very well, then you forgot a window.\"\n\nMary Anne hesitated.\n\n\"Yes'm,\" she said at last.  \"I thought I locked them all, but there was\none open this morning.\"\n\nI went out of the room and down the hall, followed by Mary Anne. The\ndoor into the clothes chute was securely bolted, and when I opened it I\nsaw the evidence of the woman's story.  A pruning-ladder had been\nbrought from where it had lain against the stable and now stood upright\nin the clothes shaft, its end resting against the wall between the\nfirst and second floors.\n\nI turned to Mary.\n\n\"This is due to your carelessness,\" I said.  \"If we had all been\nmurdered in our beds it would have been your fault.\"  She shivered.\n\"Now, not a word of this through the house, and send Alex to me.\"\n\nThe effect on Alex was to make him apoplectic with rage, and with it\nall I fancied there was an element of satisfaction.  As I look back, so\nmany things are plain to me that I wonder I could not see at the time.\nIt is all known now, and yet the whole thing was so remarkable that\nperhaps my stupidity was excusable.\n\nAlex leaned down the chute and examined the ladder carefully.\n\n\"It is caught,\" he said with a grim smile.  \"The fools, to have left a\nwarning like that!  The only trouble is, Miss Innes, they won't be apt\nto come back for a while.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't regard that in the light of a calamity,\" I replied.\n\nUntil late that evening Halsey and Alex worked at the chute. They\nforced down the ladder at last, and put a new bolt on the door.  As for\nmyself, I sat and wondered if I had a deadly enemy, intent on my\ndestruction.\n\nI was growing more and more nervous.  Liddy had given up all pretense\nat bravery, and slept regularly in my dressing-room on the couch, with\na prayer-book and a game knife from the kitchen under her pillow, thus\npreparing for both the natural and the supernatural.  That was the way\nthings stood that Thursday night, when I myself took a hand in the\nstruggle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nWHILE THE STABLES BURNED\n\nAbout nine o'clock that night Liddy came into the living-room and\nreported that one of the housemaids declared she had seen two men slip\naround the corner of the stable.  Gertrude had been sitting staring in\nfront of her, jumping at every sound.  Now she turned on Liddy\npettishly.\n\n\"I declare, Liddy,\" she said, \"you are a bundle of nerves.  What if\nEliza did see some men around the stable?  It may have been Warner and\nAlex.\"\n\n\"Warner is in the kitchen, miss,\" Liddy said with dignity.  \"And if you\nhad come through what I have, you would be a bundle of nerves, too.\nMiss Rachel, I'd be thankful if you'd give me my month's wages\nto-morrow.  I'll be going to my sister's.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, to her evident amazement.  \"I will make out the\ncheck.  Warner can take you down to the noon train.\"\n\nLiddy's face was really funny.\n\n\"You'll have a nice time at your sister's,\" I went on.  \"Five children,\nhasn't she?\"\n\n\"That's it,\" Liddy said, suddenly bursting into tears.  \"Send me away,\nafter all these years, and your new shawl only half done, and nobody\nknowin' how to fix the water for your bath.\"\n\n\"It's time I learned to prepare my own bath.\"  I was knitting\ncomplacently.  But Gertrude got up and put her arms around Liddy's\nshaking shoulders.\n\n\"You are two big babies,\" she said soothingly.  \"Neither one of you\ncould get along for an hour without the other.  So stop quarreling and\nbe good.  Liddy, go right up and lay out Aunty's night things.  She is\ngoing to bed early.\"\n\nAfter Liddy had gone I began to think about the men at the stable, and\nI grew more and more anxious.  Halsey was aimlessly knocking the\nbilliard-balls around in the billiard-room, and I called to him.\n\n\"Halsey,\" I said when he sauntered in, \"is there a policeman in\nCasanova?\"\n\n\"Constable,\" he said laconically.  \"Veteran of the war, one arm; in\noffice to conciliate the G. A. R. element.  Why?\"\n\n\"Because I am uneasy to-night.\"  And I told him what Liddy had said.\n\"Is there any one you can think of who could be relied on to watch the\noutside of the house to-night?\"\n\n\"We might get Sam Bohannon from the club,\" he said thoughtfully. \"It\nwouldn't be a bad scheme.  He's a smart darky, and with his mouth shut\nand his shirt-front covered, you couldn't see him a yard off in the\ndark.\"\n\nHalsey conferred with Alex, and the result, in an hour, was Sam. His\ninstructions were simple.  There had been numerous attempts to break\ninto the house; it was the intention, not to drive intruders away, but\nto capture them.  If Sam saw anything suspicious outside, he was to tap\nat the east entry, where Alex and Halsey were to alternate in keeping\nwatch through the night.\n\nIt was with a comfortable feeling of security that I went to bed that\nnight.  The door between Gertrude's rooms and mine had been opened,\nand, with the doors into the hall bolted, we were safe enough.\nAlthough Liddy persisted in her belief that doors would prove no\nobstacles to our disturbers.\n\nAs before, Halsey watched the east entry from ten until two. He had an\neye to comfort, and he kept vigil in a heavy oak chair, very large and\ndeep.  We went up-stairs rather early, and through the open door\nGertrude and I kept up a running fire of conversation.  Liddy was\nbrushing my hair, and Gertrude was doing her own, with a long free\nsweep of her strong round arms.\n\n\"Did you know Mrs. Armstrong and Louise are in the village?\" she called.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, startled.  \"How did you hear it?\"\n\n\"I met the oldest Stewart girl to-day, the doctor's daughter, and she\ntold me they had not gone back to town after the funeral. They went\ndirectly to that little yellow house next to Doctor Walker's, and are\napparently settled there.  They took the house furnished for the\nsummer.\"\n\n\"Why, it's a bandbox,\" I said.  \"I can't imagine Fanny Armstrong in\nsuch a place.\"\n\n\"It's true, nevertheless.  Ella Stewart says Mrs. Armstrong has aged\nterribly, and looks as if she is hardly able to walk.\"\n\nI lay and thought over some of these things until midnight.  The\nelectric lights went out then, fading slowly until there was only a\nred-hot loop to be seen in the bulb, and then even that died away and\nwe were embarked on the darkness of another night.\n\nApparently only a few minutes elapsed, during which my eyes were\nbecoming accustomed to the darkness.  Then I noticed that the windows\nwere reflecting a faint pinkish light, Liddy noticed it at the same\ntime, and I heard her jump up.  At that moment Sam's deep voice boomed\nfrom somewhere just below.\n\n\"Fire!\" he yelled.  \"The stable's on fire!\"\n\nI could see him in the glare dancing up and down on the drive, and a\nmoment later Halsey joined him.  Alex was awake and running down the\nstairs, and in five minutes from the time the fire was discovered,\nthree of the maids were sitting on their trunks in the drive, although,\nexcepting a few sparks, there was no fire nearer than a hundred yards.\n\nGertrude seldom loses her presence of mind, and she ran to the\ntelephone.  But by the time the Casanova volunteer fire department came\ntoiling up the hill the stable was a furnace, with the Dragon Fly safe\nbut blistered, in the road.  Some gasolene exploded just as the\nvolunteer department got to work, which shook their nerves as well as\nthe burning building.  The stable, being on a hill, was a torch to\nattract the population from every direction.  Rumor had it that\nSunnyside was burning, and it was amazing how many people threw\nsomething over their night-clothes and flew to the conflagration.\n\nI take it Casanova has few fires, and Sunnyside was furnishing the\npeople, in one way and another, the greatest excitement they had had\nfor years.\n\nThe stable was off the west wing.  I hardly know how I came to think of\nthe circular staircase and the unguarded door at its foot.  Liddy was\nputting my clothes into sheets, preparatory to tossing them out the\nwindow, when I found her, and I could hardly persuade her to stop.\n\n\"I want you to come with me, Liddy,\" I said.  \"Bring a candle and a\ncouple of blankets.\"\n\nShe lagged behind considerably when she saw me making for the east\nwing, and at the top of the staircase she balked.\n\n\"I am not going down there,\" she said firmly.\n\n\"There is no one guarding the door down there,\" I explained. \"Who\nknows?--this may be a scheme to draw everybody away from this end of\nthe house, and let some one in here.\"\n\nThe instant I had said it I was convinced I had hit on the explanation,\nand that perhaps it was already too late.  It seemed to me as I\nlistened that I heard stealthy footsteps on the east porch, but there\nwas so much shouting outside that it was impossible to tell.  Liddy was\non the point of retreat.\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, \"then I shall go down alone.  Run back to Mr.\nHalsey's room and get his revolver.  Don't shoot down the stairs if you\nhear a noise: remember--I shall be down there.  And hurry.\"\n\nI put the candle on the floor at the top of the staircase and took off\nmy bedroom slippers.  Then I crept down the stairs, going very slowly,\nand listening with all my ears.  I was keyed to such a pitch that I\nfelt no fear: like the condemned who sleep and eat the night before\nexecution, I was no longer able to suffer apprehension.  I was past\nthat.  Just at the foot of the stairs I stubbed my toe against Halsey's\nbig chair, and had to stand on one foot in a soundless agony until the\npain subsided to a dull ache.  And then--I knew I was right.  Some one\nhad put a key into the lock, and was turning it.  For some reason it\nrefused to work, and the key was withdrawn.  There was a muttering of\nvoices outside: I had only a second.  Another trial, and the door would\nopen.  The candle above made a faint gleam down the well-like\nstaircase, and at that moment, with a second, no more, to spare, I\nthought of a plan.\n\nThe heavy oak chair almost filled the space between the newel post and\nthe door.  With a crash I had turned it on its side, wedging it against\nthe door, its legs against the stairs.  I could hear a faint scream\nfrom Liddy, at the crash, and then she came down the stairs on a run,\nwith the revolver held straight out in front of her.\n\n\"Thank God,\" she said, in a shaking voice.  \"I thought it was you.\"\n\nI pointed to the door, and she understood.\n\n\"Call out the windows at the other end of the house,\" I whispered.\n\"Run.  Tell them not to wait for anything.\"\n\nShe went up the stairs at that, two at a time.  Evidently she collided\nwith the candle, for it went out, and I was left in darkness.\n\nI was really astonishingly cool.  I remember stepping over the chair\nand gluing my ear to the door, and I shall never forget feeling it give\nan inch or two there in the darkness, under a steady pressure from\nwithout.  But the chair held, although I could hear an ominous cracking\nof one of the legs.  And then, without the slightest warning, the\ncard-room window broke with a crash.  I had my finger on the trigger of\nthe revolver, and as I jumped it went off, right through the door.\nSome one outside swore roundly, and for the first time I could hear\nwhat was said.\n\n\"Only a scratch. . . .  Men are at the other end of the house. . . .\nHave the whole rat's nest on us.\"  And a lot of profanity which I won't\nwrite down.  The voices were at the broken window now, and although I\nwas trembling violently, I was determined that I would hold them until\nhelp came.  I moved up the stairs until I could see into the card-room,\nor rather through it, to the window.  As I looked a small man put his\nleg over the sill and stepped into the room.  The curtain confused him\nfor a moment; then he turned, not toward me, but toward the\nbilliard-room door.  I fired again, and something that was glass or\nchina crashed to the ground.  Then I ran up the stairs and along the\ncorridor to the main staircase.  Gertrude was standing there, trying to\nlocate the shots, and I must have been a peculiar figure, with my hair\nin crimps, my dressing-gown flying, no slippers, and a revolver\nclutched in my hands I had no time to talk.  There was the sound of\nfootsteps in the lower hall, and some one bounded up the stairs.\n\nI had gone Berserk, I think.  I leaned over the stair-rail and fired\nagain.  Halsey, below, yelled at me.\n\n\"What are you doing up there?\" he yelled.  \"You missed me by an inch.\"\n\nAnd then I collapsed and fainted.  When I came around Liddy was rubbing\nmy temples with eau de quinine, and the search was in full blast.\n\nWell, the man was gone.  The stable burned to the ground, while the\ncrowd cheered at every falling rafter, and the volunteer fire\ndepartment sprayed it with a garden hose.  And in the house Alex and\nHalsey searched every corner of the lower floor, finding no one.\n\nThe truth of my story was shown by the broken window and the overturned\nchair.  That the unknown had got up-stairs was almost impossible.  He\nhad not used the main staircase, there was no way to the upper floor in\nthe east wing, and Liddy had been at the window, in the west wing,\nwhere the servants' stair went up.  But we did not go to bed at all.\nSam Bohannon and Warner helped in the search, and not a closet escaped\nscrutiny.  Even the cellars were given a thorough overhauling, without\nresult.  The door in the east entry had a hole through it where my\nbullet had gone.\n\nThe hole slanted downward, and the bullet was embedded in the porch.\nSome reddish stains showed it had done execution.\n\n\"Somebody will walk lame,\" Halsey said, when he had marked the course\nof the bullet.  \"It's too low to have hit anything but a leg or foot.\"\n\nFrom that time on I watched every person I met for a limp, and to this\nday the man who halts in his walk is an object of suspicion to me.  But\nCasanova had no lame men: the nearest approach to it was an old fellow\nwho tended the safety gates at the railroad, and he, I learned on\ninquiry, had two artificial legs.  Our man had gone, and the large and\nexpensive stable at Sunnyside was a heap of smoking rafters and charred\nboards.  Warner swore the fire was incendiary, and in view of the\nattempt to enter the house, there seemed to be no doubt of it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nFLINDERS\n\nIf Halsey had only taken me fully into his confidence, through the\nwhole affair, it would have been much simpler.  If he had been\naltogether frank about Jack Bailey, and if the day after the fire he\nhad told me what he suspected, there would have been no harrowing\nperiod for all of us, with the boy in danger.  But young people refuse\nto profit by the experience of their elders, and sometimes the elders\nare the ones to suffer.\n\nI was much used up the day after the fire, and Gertrude insisted on my\ngoing out.  The machine was temporarily out of commission, and the\ncarriage horses had been sent to a farm for the summer. Gertrude\nfinally got a trap from the Casanova liveryman, and we went out.  Just\nas we turned from the drive into the road we passed a woman.  She had\nput down a small valise, and stood inspecting the house and grounds\nminutely.  I should hardly have noticed her, had it not been for the\nfact that she had been horribly disfigured by smallpox.\n\n\"Ugh!\" Gertrude said, when we had passed, \"what a face!  I shall dream\nof it to-night.  Get up, Flinders.\"\n\n\"Flinders?\" I asked.  \"Is that the horse's name?\"\n\n\"It is.\"  She flicked the horse's stubby mane with the whip.  \"He\ndidn't look like a livery horse, and the liveryman said he had bought\nhim from the Armstrongs when they purchased a couple of motors and cut\ndown the stable.  Nice Flinders--good old boy!\"\n\nFlinders was certainly not a common name for a horse, and yet the\nyoungster at Richfield had named his prancing, curly-haired little\nhorse Flinders!  It set me to thinking.\n\nAt my request Halsey had already sent word of the fire to the agent\nfrom whom we had secured the house.  Also, he had called Mr. Jamieson\nby telephone, and somewhat guardedly had told him of the previous\nnight's events.  Mr. Jamieson promised to come out that night, and to\nbring another man with him.  I did not consider it necessary to notify\nMrs. Armstrong, in the village. No doubt she knew of the fire, and in\nview of my refusal to give up the house, an interview would probably\nhave been unpleasant enough.  But as we passed Doctor Walker's white\nand green house I thought of something.\n\n\"Stop here, Gertrude,\" I said.  \"I am going to get out.\"\n\n\"To see Louise?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, I want to ask this young Walker something.\"\n\nShe was curious, I knew, but I did not wait to explain.  I went up the\nwalk to the house, where a brass sign at the side announced the office,\nand went in.  The reception-room was empty, but from the\nconsulting-room beyond came the sound of two voices, not very amicable.\n\n\"It is an outrageous figure,\" some one was storming.  Then the doctor's\nquiet tone, evidently not arguing, merely stating something.  But I had\nnot time to listen to some person probably disputing his bill, so I\ncoughed.  The voices ceased at once: a door closed somewhere, and the\ndoctor entered from the hall of the house.  He looked sufficiently\nsurprised at seeing me.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Doctor,\" I said formally.  \"I shall not keep you from\nyour patient.  I wish merely to ask you a question.\"\n\n\"Won't you sit down?\"\n\n\"It will not be necessary.  Doctor, has any one come to you, either\nearly this morning or to-day, to have you treat a bullet wound?\"\n\n\"Nothing so startling has happened to me,\" he said.  \"A bullet wound!\nThings must be lively at Sunnyside.\"\n\n\"I didn't say it was at Sunnyside.  But as it happens, it was. If any\nsuch case comes to you, will it be too much trouble for you to let me\nknow?\"\n\n\"I shall be only too happy,\" he said.  \"I understand you have had a\nfire up there, too.  A fire and shooting in one night is rather lively\nfor a quiet place like that.\"\n\n\"It is as quiet as a boiler-shop,\" I replied, as I turned to go.\n\n\"And you are still going to stay?\"\n\n\"Until I am burned out,\" I responded.  And then on my way down the\nsteps, I turned around suddenly.\n\n\"Doctor,\" I asked at a venture, \"have you ever heard of a child named\nLucien Wallace?\"\n\nClever as he was, his face changed and stiffened.  He was on his guard\nagain in a moment.\n\n\"Lucien Wallace?\" he repeated.  \"No, I think not.  There are plenty of\nWallaces around, but I don't know any Lucien.\"\n\nI was as certain as possible that he did.  People do not lie readily to\nme, and this man lied beyond a doubt.  But there was nothing to be\ngained now; his defenses were up, and I left, half irritated and wholly\nbaffled.\n\nOur reception was entirely different at Doctor Stewart's.  Taken into\nthe bosom of the family at once, Flinders tied outside and nibbling the\ngrass at the roadside, Gertrude and I drank some home-made elderberry\nwine and told briefly of the fire.  Of the more serious part of the\nnight's experience, of course, we said nothing.  But when at last we\nhad left the family on the porch and the good doctor was untying our\nsteed, I asked him the same question I had put to Doctor Walker.\n\n\"Shot!\" he said.  \"Bless my soul, no.  Why, what have you been doing up\nat the big house, Miss Innes?\"\n\n\"Some one tried to enter the house during the fire, and was shot and\nslightly injured,\" I said hastily.  \"Please don't mention it; we wish\nto make as little of it as possible.\"\n\nThere was one other possibility, and we tried that.  At Casanova\nstation I saw the station master, and asked him if any trains left\nCasanova between one o'clock and daylight.  There was none until six\nA.M.  The next question required more diplomacy.\n\n\"Did you notice on the six-o'clock train any person--any man--who\nlimped a little?\" I asked.  \"Please try to remember: we are trying to\ntrace a man who was seen loitering around Sunnyside last night before\nthe fire.\"\n\nHe was all attention in a moment.\n\n\"I was up there myself at the fire,\" he said volubly.  \"I'm a member of\nthe volunteer company.  First big fire we've had since the summer house\nburned over to the club golf links.  My wife was sayin' the other day,\n'Dave, you might as well 'a' saved the money in that there helmet and\nshirt.'  And here last night they came in handy.  Rang that bell so\nhard I hadn't time scarcely to get 'em on.\"\n\n\"And--did you see a man who limped?\" Gertrude put in, as he stopped for\nbreath.\n\n\"Not at the train, ma'm,\" he said.  \"No such person got on here to-day.\nBut I'll tell you where I did see a man that limped.  I didn't wait\ntill the fire company left; there's a fast freight goes through at four\nforty-five, and I had to get down to the station.  I seen there wasn't\nmuch more to do anyhow at the fire--we'd got the flames under\ncontrol\"--Gertrude looked at me and smiled--\"so I started down the\nhill.  There was folks here and there goin' home, and along by the path\nto the Country Club I seen two men.  One was a short fellow.  He was\nsitting on a big rock, his back to me, and he had something white in\nhis hand, as if he was tying up his foot.  After I'd gone on a piece I\nlooked back, and he was hobbling on and--excuse me, miss--he was\nswearing something sickening.\"\n\n\"Did they go toward the club?\" Gertrude asked suddenly, leaning forward.\n\n\"No, miss.  I think they came into the village.  I didn't get a look at\ntheir faces, but I know every chick and child in the place, and\neverybody knows me.  When they didn't shout at me--in my uniform, you\nknow--I took it they were strangers.\"\n\nSo all we had for our afternoon's work was this: some one had been shot\nby the bullet that went through the door; he had not left the village,\nand he had not called in a physician.  Also, Doctor Walker knew who\nLucien Wallace was, and his very denial made me confident that, in that\none direction at least, we were on the right track.\n\nThe thought that the detective would be there that night was the most\ncheering thing of all, and I think even Gertrude was glad of it.\nDriving home that afternoon, I saw her in the clear sunlight for the\nfirst time in several days, and I was startled to see how ill she\nlooked.  She was thin and colorless, and all her bright animation was\ngone.\n\n\"Gertrude,\" I said, \"I have been a very selfish old woman.  You are\ngoing to leave this miserable house to-night.  Annie Morton is going to\nScotland next week, and you shall go right with her.\"\n\nTo my surprise, she flushed painfully.\n\n\"I don't want to go, Aunt Ray,\" she said.  \"Don't make me leave now.\"\n\n\"You are losing your health and your good looks,\" I said decidedly.\n\"You should have a change.\"\n\n\"I shan't stir a foot.\"  She was equally decided.  Then, more lightly:\n\"Why, you and Liddy need me to arbitrate between you every day in the\nweek.\"\n\nPerhaps I was growing suspicious of every one, but it seemed to me that\nGertrude's gaiety was forced and artificial.  I watched her covertly\nduring the rest of the drive, and I did not like the two spots of\ncrimson in her pale cheeks.  But I said nothing more about sending her\nto Scotland: I knew she would not go.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nA VISIT FROM LOUISE\n\nThat day was destined to be an eventful one, for when I entered the\nhouse and found Eliza ensconced in the upper hall on a chair, with Mary\nAnne doing her best to stifle her with household ammonia, and Liddy\nrubbing her wrists--whatever good that is supposed to do--I knew that\nthe ghost had been walking again, and this time in daylight.\n\nEliza was in a frenzy of fear.  She clutched at my sleeve when I went\nclose to her, and refused to let go until she had told her story.\nComing just after the fire, the household was demoralized, and it was\nno surprise to me to find Alex and the under-gardener struggling\ndown-stairs with a heavy trunk between them.\n\n\"I didn't want to do it, Miss Innes,\" Alex said.  \"But she was so\nexcited, I was afraid she would do as she said--drag it down herself,\nand scratch the staircase.\"\n\nI was trying to get my bonnet off and to keep the maids quiet at the\nsame time.  \"Now, Eliza, when you have washed your face and stopped\nbawling,\" I said, \"come into my sitting-room and tell me what has\nhappened.\"\n\nLiddy put away my things without speaking.  The very set of her\nshoulders expressed disapproval.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, when the silence became uncomfortable, \"things seem to\nbe warming up.\"\n\nSilence from Liddy, and a long sigh.\n\n\"If Eliza goes, I don't know where to look for another cook.\" More\nsilence.\n\n\"Rosie is probably a good cook.\"  Sniff.\n\n\"Liddy,\" I said at last, \"don't dare to deny that you are having the\ntime of your life.  You positively gloat in this excitement. You never\nlooked better.  It's my opinion all this running around, and getting\njolted out of a rut, has stirred up that torpid liver of yours.\"\n\n\"It's not myself I'm thinking about,\" she said, goaded into speech.\n\"Maybe my liver was torpid, and maybe it wasn't; but I know this: I've\ngot some feelings left, and to see you standing at the foot of that\nstaircase shootin' through the door--I'll never be the same woman\nagain.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad of that--anything for a change,\" I said.  And in came\nEliza, flanked by Rosie and Mary Anne.\n\nHer story, broken with sobs and corrections from the other two, was\nthis:  At two o'clock (two-fifteen, Rosie insisted) she had gone\nup-stairs to get a picture from her room to show Mary Anne. (A picture\nof a LADY, Mary Anne interposed.)  She went up the servants' staircase\nand along the corridor to her room, which lay between the trunk-room\nand the unfinished ball-room.  She heard a sound as she went down the\ncorridor, like some one moving furniture, but she was not nervous.  She\nthought it might be men examining the house after the fire the night\nbefore, but she looked in the trunk-room and saw nobody.\n\nShe went into her room quietly.  The noise had ceased, and everything\nwas quiet.  Then she sat down on the side of her bed, and, feeling\nfaint--she was subject to spells--(\"I told you that when I came, didn't\nI, Rosie?\"  \"Yes'm, indeed she did!\")--she put her head down on her\npillow and--\n\n\"Took a nap.  All right!\" I said.  \"Go on.\"\n\n\"When I came to, Miss Innes, sure as I'm sittin' here, I thought I'd\ndie.  Somethin' hit me on the face, and I set up, sudden. And then I\nseen the plaster drop, droppin' from a little hole in the wall.  And\nthe first thing I knew, an iron bar that long\" (fully two yards by her\nmeasure) \"shot through that hole and tumbled on the bed.  If I'd been\nstill sleeping\"  (\"Fainting,\" corrected Rosie) \"I'd 'a' been hit on the\nhead and killed!\"\n\n\"I wisht you'd heard her scream,\" put in Mary Anne.  \"And her face as\nwhite as a pillow-slip when she tumbled down the stairs.\"\n\n\"No doubt there is some natural explanation for it, Eliza,\" I said.\n\"You may have dreamed it, in your 'fainting' attack.  But if it is\ntrue, the metal rod and the hole in the wall will show it.\"\n\nEliza looked a little bit sheepish.\n\n\"The hole's there all right, Miss Innes,\" she said.  \"But the bar was\ngone when Mary Anne and Rosie went up to pack my trunk.\"\n\n\"That wasn't all,\" Liddy's voice came funereally from a corner. \"Eliza\nsaid that from the hole in the wall a burning eye looked down at her!\"\n\n\"The wall must be at least six inches thick,\" I said with asperity.\n\"Unless the person who drilled the hole carried his eyes on the ends of\na stick, Eliza couldn't possibly have seen them.\"\n\nBut the fact remained, and a visit to Eliza's room proved it.  I might\njeer all I wished: some one had drilled a hole in the unfinished wall\nof the ball-room, passing between the bricks of the partition, and\nshooting through the unresisting plaster of Eliza's room with such\nforce as to send the rod flying on to her bed.  I had gone up-stairs\nalone, and I confess the thing puzzled me: in two or three places in\nthe wall small apertures had been made, none of them of any depth.  Not\nthe least mysterious thing was the disappearance of the iron implement\nthat had been used.\n\nI remembered a story I read once about an impish dwarf that lived in\nthe spaces between the double walls of an ancient castle.  I wondered\nvaguely if my original idea of a secret entrance to a hidden chamber\ncould be right, after all, and if we were housing some erratic guest,\nwho played pranks on us in the dark, and destroyed the walls that he\nmight listen, hidden safely away, to our amazed investigations.\n\nMary Anne and Eliza left that afternoon, but Rosie decided to stay.  It\nwas about five o'clock when the hack came from the station to get them,\nand, to my amazement, it had an occupant. Matthew Geist, the driver,\nasked for me, and explained his errand with pride.\n\n\"I've brought you a cook, Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"When the message came\nto come up for two girls and their trunks, I supposed there was\nsomething doing, and as this here woman had been looking for work in\nthe village, I thought I'd bring her along.\"\n\nAlready I had acquired the true suburbanite ability to take servants on\nfaith; I no longer demanded written and unimpeachable references.  I,\nRachel Innes, have learned not to mind if the cook sits down\ncomfortably in my sitting-room when she is taking the orders for the\nday, and I am grateful if the silver is not cleaned with scouring soap.\nAnd so that day I merely told Liddy to send the new applicant in.  When\nshe came, however, I could hardly restrain a gasp of surprise.  It was\nthe woman with the pitted face.\n\nShe stood somewhat awkwardly just inside the door, and she had an air\nof self-confidence that was inspiring.  Yes, she could cook; was not a\nfancy cook, but could make good soups and desserts if there was any one\nto take charge of the salads.  And so, in the end, I took her.  As\nHalsey said, when we told him, it didn't matter much about the cook's\nface, if it was clean.\n\nI have spoken of Halsey's restlessness.  On that day it seemed to be\nmore than ever a resistless impulse that kept him out until after\nluncheon.  I think he hoped constantly that he might meet Louise\ndriving over the hills in her runabout: possibly he did meet her\noccasionally, but from his continued gloom I felt sure the situation\nbetween them was unchanged.\n\nPart of the afternoon I believe he read--Gertrude and I were out, as I\nhave said, and at dinner we both noticed that something had occurred to\ndistract him.  He was disagreeable, which is unlike him, nervous,\nlooking at his watch every few minutes, and he ate almost nothing.  He\nasked twice during the meal on what train Mr. Jamieson and the other\ndetective were coming, and had long periods of abstraction during which\nhe dug his fork into my damask cloth and did not hear when he was\nspoken to.  He refused dessert, and left the table early, excusing\nhimself on the ground that he wanted to see Alex.\n\nAlex, however, was not to be found.  It was after eight when Halsey\nordered the car, and started down the hill at a pace that, even for\nhim, was unusually reckless.  Shortly after, Alex reported that he was\nready to go over the house, preparatory to closing it for the night.\nSam Bohannon came at a quarter before nine, and began his patrol of the\ngrounds, and with the arrival of the two detectives to look forward to,\nI was not especially apprehensive.\n\nAt half-past nine I heard the sound of a horse driven furiously up the\ndrive.  It came to a stop in front of the house, and immediately after\nthere were hurried steps on the veranda.  Our nerves were not what they\nshould have been, and Gertrude, always apprehensive lately, was at the\ndoor almost instantly.  A moment later Louise had burst into the room\nand stood there bareheaded and breathing hard!\n\n\"Where is Halsey?\" she demanded.  Above her plain black gown her eyes\nlooked big and somber, and the rapid drive had brought no color to her\nface.  I got up and drew forward a chair.\n\n\"He has not come back,\" I said quietly.  \"Sit down, child; you are not\nstrong enough for this kind of thing.\"\n\nI don't think she even heard me.\n\n\"He has not come back?\" she asked, looking from me to Gertrude. \"Do you\nknow where he went?  Where can I find him?\"\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, Louise,\" Gertrude burst out, \"tell us what is\nwrong.  Halsey is not here.  He has gone to the station for Mr.\nJamieson.  What has happened?\"\n\n\"To the station, Gertrude?  You are sure?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.  \"Listen.  There is the whistle of the train now.\"\n\nShe relaxed a little at our matter-of-fact tone, and allowed herself to\nsink into a chair.\n\n\"Perhaps I was wrong,\" she said heavily.  \"He--will be here in a few\nmoments if--everything is right.\"\n\nWe sat there, the three of us, without attempt at conversation. Both\nGertrude and I recognized the futility of asking Louise any questions:\nher reticence was a part of a role she had assumed. Our ears were\nstrained for the first throb of the motor as it turned into the drive\nand commenced the climb to the house.  Ten minutes passed, fifteen,\ntwenty.  I saw Louise's hands grow rigid as they clutched the arms of\nher chair.  I watched Gertrude's bright color slowly ebbing away, and\naround my own heart I seemed to feel the grasp of a giant hand.\n\nTwenty-five minutes, and then a sound.  But it was not the chug of the\nmotor: it was the unmistakable rumble of the Casanova hack.  Gertrude\ndrew aside the curtain and peered into the darkness.\n\n\"It's the hack, I am sure,\" she said, evidently relieved. \"Something\nhas gone wrong with the car, and no wonder--the way Halsey went down\nthe hill.\"\n\nIt seemed a long time before the creaking vehicle came to a stop at the\ndoor.  Louise rose and stood watching, her hand to her throat.  And\nthen Gertrude opened the door, admitting Mr. Jamieson and a stocky,\nmiddle-aged man.  Halsey was not with them.  When the door had closed\nand Louise realized that Halsey had not come, her expression changed.\nFrom tense watchfulness to relief, and now again to absolute despair,\nher face was an open page.\n\n\"Halsey?\" I asked unceremoniously, ignoring the stranger.  \"Did he not\nmeet you?\"\n\n\"No.\"  Mr. Jamieson looked slightly surprised.  \"I rather expected the\ncar, but we got up all right.\"\n\n\"You didn't see him at all?\" Louise demanded breathlessly.\n\nMr. Jamieson knew her at once, although he had not seen her before.\nShe had kept to her rooms until the morning she left.\n\n\"No, Miss Armstrong,\" he said.  \"I saw nothing of him.  What is wrong?\"\n\n\"Then we shall have to find him,\" she asserted.  \"Every instant is\nprecious.  Mr. Jamieson, I have reason for believing that he is in\ndanger, but I don't know what it is.  Only--he must be found.\"\n\nThe stocky man had said nothing.  Now, however, he went quickly toward\nthe door.\n\n\"I'll catch the hack down the road and hold it,\" he said.  \"Is the\ngentleman down in the town?\"\n\n\"Mr. Jamieson,\" Louise said impulsively, \"I can use the hack. Take my\nhorse and trap outside and drive like mad.  Try to find the Dragon\nFly--it ought to be easy to trace.  I can think of no other way.  Only,\ndon't lose a moment.\"\n\nThe new detective had gone, and a moment later Jamieson went rapidly\ndown the drive, the cob's feet striking fire at every step.  Louise\nstood looking after them.  When she turned around she faced Gertrude,\nwho stood indignant, almost tragic, in the hall.\n\n\"You KNOW what threatens Halsey, Louise,\" she said accusingly.  \"I\nbelieve you know this whole horrible thing, this mystery that we are\nstruggling with.  If anything happens to Halsey, I shall never forgive\nyou.\"\n\nLouise only raised her hands despairingly and dropped them again.\n\n\"He is as dear to me as he is to you,\" she said sadly.  \"I tried to\nwarn him.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said, as briskly as I could.  \"We are making a lot of\ntrouble out of something perhaps very small.  Halsey was probably\nlate--he is always late.  Any moment we may hear the car coming up the\nroad.\"\n\nBut it did not come.  After a half-hour of suspense, Louise went out\nquietly, and did not come back.  I hardly knew she was gone until I\nheard the station hack moving off.  At eleven o'clock the telephone\nrang.  It was Mr. Jamieson.\n\n\"I have found the Dragon Fly, Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"It has collided\nwith a freight car on the siding above the station.  No, Mr. Innes was\nnot there, but we shall probably find him.  Send Warner for the car.\"\n\nBut they did not find him.  At four o'clock the next morning we were\nstill waiting for news, while Alex watched the house and Sam the\ngrounds.  At daylight I dropped into exhausted sleep. Halsey had not\ncome back, and there was no word from the detective.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nHALSEY'S DISAPPEARANCE\n\nNothing that had gone before had been as bad as this.  The murder and\nThomas' sudden death we had been able to view in a detached sort of\nway.  But with Halsey's disappearance everything was altered.  Our\nlittle circle, intact until now, was broken.  We were no longer\nonlookers who saw a battle passing around them. We were the center of\naction.  Of course, there was no time then to voice such an idea.  My\nmind seemed able to hold only one thought: that Halsey had been foully\ndealt with, and that every minute lost might be fatal.\n\nMr. Jamieson came back about eight o'clock the next morning: he was\ncovered with mud, and his hat was gone.  Altogether, we were a\nsad-looking trio that gathered around a breakfast that no one could\neat.  Over a cup of black coffee the detective told us what he had\nlearned of Halsey's movements the night before. Up to a certain point\nthe car had made it easy enough to follow him.  And I gathered that Mr.\nBurns, the other detective, had followed a similar car for miles at\ndawn, only to find it was a touring car on an endurance run.\n\n\"He left here about ten minutes after eight,\" Mr. Jamieson said. \"He\nwent alone, and at eight twenty he stopped at Doctor Walker's.  I went\nto the doctor's about midnight, but he had been called out on a case,\nand had not come back at four o'clock. From the doctor's it seems Mr.\nInnes walked across the lawn to the cottage Mrs. Armstrong and her\ndaughter have taken.  Mrs. Armstrong had retired, and he said perhaps a\ndozen words to Miss Louise.  She will not say what they were, but the\ngirl evidently suspects what has occurred.  That is, she suspects foul\nplay, but she doesn't know of what nature.  Then, apparently, he\nstarted directly for the station.  He was going very fast--the flagman\nat the Carol Street crossing says he saw the car pass.  He knew the\nsiren.  Along somewhere in the dark stretch between Carol Street and\nthe depot he evidently swerved suddenly--perhaps some one in the\nroad--and went full into the side of a freight.  We found it there last\nnight.\"\n\n\"He might have been thrown under the train by the force of the shock,\"\nI said tremulously.\n\nGertrude shuddered.\n\n\"We examined every inch of track.  There was--no sign.\"\n\n\"But surely--he can't be--gone!\" I cried.  \"Aren't there traces in the\nmud--anything?\"\n\n\"There is no mud--only dust.  There has been no rain.  And the footpath\nthere is of cinders.  Miss Innes, I am inclined to think that he has\nmet with bad treatment, in the light of what has gone before.  I do not\nthink he has been murdered.\"  I shrank from the word.  \"Burns is back\nin the country, on a clue we got from the night clerk at the\ndrug-store.  There will be two more men here by noon, and the city\noffice is on the lookout.\"\n\n\"The creek?\" Gertrude asked.\n\n\"The creek is shallow now.  If it were swollen with rain, it would be\ndifferent.  There is hardly any water in it.  Now, Miss Innes,\" he\nsaid, turning to me, \"I must ask you some questions. Had Mr. Halsey any\npossible reason for going away like this, without warning?\"\n\n\"None whatever.\"\n\n\"He went away once before,\" he persisted.  \"And you were as sure then.\"\n\n\"He did not leave the Dragon Fly jammed into the side of a freight car\nbefore.\"\n\n\"No, but he left it for repairs in a blacksmith shop, a long distance\nfrom here.  Do you know if he had any enemies?  Any one who might wish\nhim out of the way?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of, unless--no, I can not think of any.\"\n\n\"Was he in the habit of carrying money?\"\n\n\"He never carried it far.  No, he never had more than enough for\ncurrent expenses.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson got up then and began to pace the room.  It was an\nunwonted concession to the occasion.\n\n\"Then I think we get at it by elimination.  The chances are against\nflight.  If he was hurt, we find no trace of him.  It looks almost like\nan abduction.  This young Doctor Walker--have you any idea why Mr.\nInnes should have gone there last night?\"\n\n\"I can not understand it,\" Gertrude said thoughtfully.  \"I don't think\nhe knew Doctor Walker at all, and--their relations could hardly have\nbeen cordial, under the circumstances.\"\n\nJamieson pricked up his ears, and little by little he drew from us the\nunfortunate story of Halsey's love affair, and the fact that Louise was\ngoing to marry Doctor Walker.\n\nMr. Jamieson listened attentively.\n\n\"There are some interesting developments here,\" he said thoughtfully.\n\"The woman who claims to be the mother of Lucien Wallace has not come\nback.  Your nephew has apparently been spirited away.  There is an\norganized attempt being made to enter this house; in fact, it has been\nentered.  Witness the incident with the cook yesterday.  And I have a\nnew piece of information.\"\n\nHe looked carefully away from Gertrude.  \"Mr. John Bailey is not at his\nKnickerbocker apartments, and I don't know where he is. It's a hash,\nthat's what it is.  It's a Chinese puzzle.  They won't fit together,\nunless--unless Mr. Bailey and your nephew have again--\"\n\nAnd once again Gertrude surprised me.  \"They are not together,\" she\nsaid hotly.  \"I--know where Mr. Bailey is, and my brother is not with\nhim.\"\n\nThe detective turned and looked at her keenly.\n\n\"Miss Gertrude,\" he said, \"if you and Miss Louise would only tell me\neverything you know and surmise about this business, I should be able\nto do a great many things.  I believe I could find your brother, and I\nmight be able to--well, to do some other things.\"  But Gertrude's\nglance did not falter.\n\n\"Nothing that I know could help you to find Halsey,\" she said\nstubbornly.  \"I know absolutely as little of his disappearance as you\ndo, and I can only say this: I do not trust Doctor Walker.  I think he\nhated Halsey, and he would get rid of him if he could.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are right.  In fact, I had some such theory myself. But\nDoctor Walker went out late last night to a serious case in\nSummitville, and is still there.  Burns traced him there.  We have made\nguarded inquiry at the Greenwood Club, and through the village.  There\nis absolutely nothing to go on but this.  On the embankment above the\nrailroad, at the point where we found the machine, is a small house.\nAn old woman and a daughter, who is very lame, live there.  They say\nthat they distinctly heard the shock when the Dragon Fly hit the car,\nand they went to the bottom of their garden and looked over.  The\nautomobile was there; they could see the lights, and they thought\nsomeone had been injured.  It was very dark, but they could make out\ntwo figures, standing together.  The women were curious, and, leaving\nthe fence, they went back and by a roundabout path down to the road.\nWhen they got there the car was still standing, the headlight broken\nand the bonnet crushed, but there was no one to be seen.\"\n\nThe detective went away immediately, and to Gertrude and me was left\nthe woman's part, to watch and wait.  By luncheon nothing had been\nfound, and I was frantic.  I went up-stairs to Halsey's room finally,\nfrom sheer inability to sit across from Gertrude any longer, and meet\nher terror-filled eyes.\n\nLiddy was in my dressing-room, suspiciously red-eyed, and trying to put\na right sleeve in a left armhole of a new waist for me.  I was too much\nshaken to scold.\n\n\"What name did that woman in the kitchen give?\" she demanded, viciously\nripping out the offending sleeve.\n\n\"Bliss.  Mattie Bliss,\" I replied.\n\n\"Bliss.  M. B.  Well, that's not what she has on he suitcase.  It is\nmarked N. F. C.\"\n\nThe new cook and her initials troubled me not at all.  I put on my\nbonnet and sent for what the Casanova liveryman called a \"stylish\nturnout.\"  Having once made up my mind to a course of action, I am not\none to turn back.  Warner drove me; he was plainly disgusted, and he\nsteered the livery horse as he would the Dragon Fly, feeling uneasily\nwith his left foot for the clutch, and working his right elbow at an\nimaginary horn every time a dog got in the way.\n\nWarner had something on his mind, and after we had turned into the\nroad, he voiced it.\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"I overheard a part of a conversation yesterday\nthat I didn't understand.  It wasn't my business to understand it, for\nthat matter.  But I've been thinking all day that I'd better tell you.\nYesterday afternoon, while you and Miss Gertrude were out driving, I\nhad got the car in some sort of shape again after the fire, and I went\nto the library to call Mr. Innes to see it.  I went into the\nliving-room, where Miss Liddy said he was, and half-way across to the\nlibrary I heard him talking to some one.  He seemed to be walking up\nand down, and he was in a rage, I can tell you.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"The first thing I heard was--excuse me, Miss Innes, but it's what he\nsaid, 'The damned rascal,' he said, 'I'll see him in'--well, in hell\nwas what he said, 'in hell first.'  Then somebody else spoke up; it was\na woman.  She said, 'I warned them, but they thought I would be\nafraid.'\"\n\n\"A woman!  Did you wait to see who it was?\"\n\n\"I wasn't spying, Miss Innes,\" Warner said with dignity.  \"But the next\nthing caught my attention.  She said, 'I knew there was something wrong\nfrom the start.  A man isn't well one day, and dead the next, without\nsome reason.'  I thought she was speaking of Thomas.\"\n\n\"And you don't know who it was!\" I exclaimed.  \"Warner, you had the key\nto this whole occurrence in your hands, and did not use it!\"\n\nHowever, there was nothing to be done.  I resolved to make inquiry when\nI got home, and in the meantime, my present errand absorbed me.  This\nwas nothing less than to see Louise Armstrong, and to attempt to drag\nfrom her what she knew, or suspected, of Halsey's disappearance.  But\nhere, as in every direction I turned, I was baffled.\n\nA neat maid answered the bell, but she stood squarely in the doorway,\nand it was impossible to preserve one's dignity and pass her.\n\n\"Miss Armstrong is very ill, and unable to see any one,\" she said.  I\ndid not believe her.\n\n\"And Mrs. Armstrong--is she also ill?\"\n\n\"She is with Miss Louise and can not be disturbed.\"\n\n\"Tell her it is Miss Innes, and that it is a matter of the greatest\nimportance.\"\n\n\"It would be of no use, Miss Innes.  My orders are positive.\"\n\nAt that moment a heavy step sounded on the stairs.  Past the maid's\nwhite-strapped shoulder I could see a familiar thatch of gray hair, and\nin a moment I was face to face with Doctor Stewart.  He was very grave,\nand his customary geniality was tinged with restraint.\n\n\"You are the very woman I want to see,\" he said promptly.  \"Send away\nyour trap, and let me drive you home.  What is this about your nephew?\"\n\n\"He has disappeared, doctor.  Not only that, but there is every\nevidence that he has been either abducted, or--\" I could not finish.\nThe doctor helped me into his capacious buggy in silence.  Until we had\ngot a little distance he did not speak; then he turned and looked at me.\n\n\"Now tell me about it,\" he said.  He heard me through without speaking.\n\n\"And you think Louise knows something?\" he said when I had finished.\n\"I don't--in fact, I am sure of it.  The best evidence of it is this:\nshe asked me if he had been heard from, or if anything had been\nlearned.  She won't allow Walker in the room, and she made me promise\nto see you and tell you this: don't give up the search for him.  Find\nhim, and find him soon.  He is living.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"if she knows that, she knows more.  She is a very\ncruel and ungrateful girl.\"\n\n\"She is a very sick girl,\" he said gravely.  \"Neither you nor I can\njudge her until we know everything.  Both she and her mother are ghosts\nof their former selves.  Under all this, these two sudden deaths, this\nbank robbery, the invasions at Sunnyside and Halsey's disappearance,\nthere is some mystery that, mark my words, will come out some day.  And\nwhen it does, we shall find Louise Armstrong a victim.\"\n\nI had not noticed where we were going, but now I saw we were beside the\nrailroad, and from a knot of men standing beside the track I divined\nthat it was here the car had been found.  The siding, however, was\nempty.  Except a few bits of splintered wood on the ground, there was\nno sign of the accident.\n\n\"Where is the freight car that was rammed?\" the doctor asked a\nbystander.\n\n\"It was taken away at daylight, when the train was moved.\"\n\nThere was nothing to be gained.  He pointed out the house on the\nembankment where the old lady and her daughter had heard the crash and\nseen two figures beside the car.  Then we drove slowly home.  I had the\ndoctor put me down at the gate, and I walked to the house--past the\nlodge where we had found Louise, and, later, poor Thomas; up the drive\nwhere I had seen a man watching the lodge and where, later, Rosie had\nbeen frightened; past the east entrance, where so short a time before\nthe most obstinate effort had been made to enter the house, and where,\nthat night two weeks ago, Liddy and I had seen the strange woman.  Not\nfar from the west wing lay the blackened ruins of the stables.  I felt\nlike a ruin myself, as I paused on the broad veranda before I entered\nthe house.\n\nTwo private detectives had arrived in my absence, and it was a relief\nto turn over to them the responsibility of the house and grounds.  Mr.\nJamieson, they said, had arranged for more to assist in the search for\nthe missing man, and at that time the country was being scoured in all\ndirections.\n\nThe household staff was again depleted that afternoon.  Liddy was\nwaiting to tell me that the new cook had gone, bag and baggage, without\nwaiting to be paid.  No one had admitted the visitor whom Warner had\nheard in the library, unless, possibly, the missing cook.  Again I was\nworking in a circle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nWHO IS NINA CARRINGTON?\n\nThe four days, from Saturday to the following Tuesday, we lived, or\nexisted, in a state of the most dreadful suspense.  We ate only when\nLiddy brought in a tray, and then very little.  The papers, of course,\nhad got hold of the story, and we were besieged by newspaper men.  From\nall over the country false clues came pouring in and raised hopes that\ncrumbled again to nothing. Every morgue within a hundred miles, every\nhospital, had been visited, without result.\n\nMr. Jamieson, personally, took charge of the organized search, and\nevery evening, no matter where he happened to be, he called us by long\ndistance telephone.  It was the same formula. \"Nothing to-day.  A new\nclue to work on.  Better luck to-morrow.\"\n\nAnd heartsick we would put up the receiver and sit down again to our\nvigil.\n\nThe inaction was deadly.  Liddy cried all day, and, because she knew I\nobjected to tears, sniffled audibly around the corner.\n\n\"For Heaven's sake, smile!\" I snapped at her.  And her ghastly attempt\nat a grin, with her swollen nose and red eyes, made me hysterical.  I\nlaughed and cried together, and pretty soon, like the two old fools we\nwere, we were sitting together weeping into the same handkerchief.\n\nThings were happening, of course, all the time, but they made little or\nno impression.  The Charity Hospital called up Doctor Stewart and\nreported that Mrs. Watson was in a critical condition.  I understood\nalso that legal steps were being taken to terminate my lease at\nSunnyside.  Louise was out of danger, but very ill, and a trained nurse\nguarded her like a gorgon. There was a rumor in the village, brought up\nby Liddy from the butcher's, that a wedding had already taken place\nbetween Louise and Doctor Walkers and this roused me for the first time\nto action.\n\nOn Tuesday, then, I sent for the car, and prepared to go out.  As I\nwaited at the porte-cochere I saw the under-gardener, an inoffensive,\ngrayish-haired man, trimming borders near the house.\n\nThe day detective was watching him, sitting on the carriage block.\nWhen he saw me, he got up.\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said, taking of his hat, \"do you know where Alex, the\ngardener, is?\"\n\n\"Why, no.  Isn't he here?\" I asked.\n\n\"He has been gone since yesterday afternoon.  Have you employed him\nlong?\"\n\n\"Only a couple of weeks.\"\n\n\"Is he efficient?  A capable man?\"\n\n\"I hardly know,\" I said vaguely.  \"The place looks all right, and I\nknow very little about such things.  I know much more about boxes of\nroses than bushes of them.\"\n\n\"This man,\" pointing to the assistant, \"says Alex isn't a gardener.\nThat he doesn't know anything about plants.\"\n\n\"That's very strange,\" I said, thinking hard.  \"Why, he came to me from\nthe Brays, who are in Europe.\"\n\n\"Exactly.\"  The detective smiled.  \"Every man who cuts grass isn't a\ngardener, Miss Innes, and just now it is our policy to believe every\nperson around here a rascal until he proves to be the other thing.\"\n\nWarner came up with the car then, and the conversation stopped.  As he\nhelped me in, however, the detective said something further.\n\n\"Not a word or sign to Alex, if he comes back,\" he said cautiously.\n\nI went first to Doctor Walker's.  I was tired of beating about the\nbush, and I felt that the key to Halsey's disappearance was here at\nCasanova, in spite of Mr. Jamieson's theories.\n\nThe doctor was in.  He came at once to the door of his consulting-room,\nand there was no mask of cordiality in his manner.\n\n\"Please come in,\" he said curtly.\n\n\"I shall stay here, I think, doctor.\"  I did not like his face or his\nmanner; there was a subtle change in both.  He had thrown off the air of\nfriendliness, and I thought, too, that he looked anxious and haggard.\n\n\"Doctor Walker,\" I said, \"I have come to you to ask some questions.  I\nhope you will answer them.  As you know, my nephew has not yet been\nfound.\"\n\n\"So I understand,\" stiffly.\n\n\"I believe, if you would, you could help us, and that leads to one of\nmy questions.  Will you tell me what was the nature of the conversation\nyou held with him the night he was attacked and carried off?\"\n\n\"Attacked!  Carried off!\" he said, with pretended surprise. \"Really,\nMiss Innes, don't you think you exaggerate?  I understand it is not the\nfirst time Mr. Innes has--disappeared.\"\n\n\"You are quibbling, doctor.  This is a matter of life and death. Will\nyou answer my question?\"\n\n\"Certainly.  He said his nerves were bad, and I gave him a prescription\nfor them.  I am violating professional ethics when I tell you even as\nmuch as that.\"\n\nI could not tell him he lied.  I think I looked it.  But I hazarded a\nrandom shot.\n\n\"I thought perhaps,\" I said, watching him narrowly, \"that it might be\nabout--Nina Carrington.\"\n\nFor a moment I thought he was going to strike me.  He grew livid, and a\nsmall crooked blood-vessel in his temple swelled and throbbed\ncuriously.  Then he forced a short laugh.\n\n\"Who is Nina Carrington?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am about to discover that,\" I replied, and he was quiet at once.  It\nwas not difficult to divine that he feared Nina Carrington a good deal\nmore than he did the devil.  Our leave-taking was brief; in fact, we\nmerely stared at each other over the waiting-room table, with its\nlitter of year-old magazines.  Then I turned and went out.\n\n\"To Richfield,\" I told Warner, and on the way I thought, and thought\nhard.\n\n\"Nina Carrington, Nina Carrington,\" the roar and rush of the wheels\nseemed to sing the words.  \"Nina Carrington, N. C.\"  And I then knew,\nknew as surely as if I had seen the whole thing. There had been an N.\nC. on the suit-case belonging to the woman with the pitted face.  How\nsimple it all seemed.  Mattie Bliss had been Nina Carrington.  It was\nshe Warner had heard in the library.  It was something she had told\nHalsey that had taken him frantically to Doctor Walker's office, and\nfrom there perhaps to his death.  If we could find the woman, we might\nfind what had become of Halsey.\n\nWe were almost at Richfield now, so I kept on.  My mind was not on my\nerrand there now.  It was back with Halsey on that memorable night.\nWhat was it he had said to Louise, that had sent her up to Sunnyside,\nhalf wild with fear for him?  I made up my mind, as the car drew up\nbefore the Tate cottage, that I would see Louise if I had to break into\nthe house at night.\n\nAlmost exactly the same scene as before greeted my eyes at the cottage.\nMrs. Tate, the baby-carriage in the path, the children at the\nswing--all were the same.\n\nShe came forward to meet me, and I noticed that some of the anxious\nlines had gone out of her face.  She looked young, almost pretty.\n\n\"I am glad you have come back,\" she said.  \"I think I will have to be\nhonest and give you back your money.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I asked.  \"Has the mother come?\"\n\n\"No, but some one came and paid the boy's board for a month.  She\ntalked to him for a long time, but when I asked him afterward he didn't\nknow her name.\"\n\n\"A young woman?\"\n\n\"Not very young.  About forty, I suppose.  She was small and\nfair-haired, just a little bit gray, and very sad.  She was in deep\nmourning, and, I think, when she came, she expected to go at once.  But\nthe child, Lucien, interested her.  She talked to him for a long time,\nand, indeed, she looked much happier when she left.\"\n\n\"You are sure this was not the real mother?\"\n\n\"O mercy, no!  Why, she didn't know which of the three was Lucien.  I\nthought perhaps she was a friend of yours, but, of course, I didn't\nask.\"\n\n\"She was not--pock-marked?\" I asked at a venture.  \"No, indeed. A skin\nlike a baby's.  But perhaps you will know the initials. She gave Lucien\na handkerchief and forgot it.  It was very fine, black-bordered, and it\nhad three hand-worked letters in the corner--F. B. A.\"\n\n\"No,\" I said with truth enough, \"she is not a friend of mine.\" F. B. A.\nwas Fanny Armstrong, without a chance of doubt!\n\nWith another warning to Mrs. Tate as to silence, we started back to\nSunnyside.  So Fanny Armstrong knew of Lucien Wallace, and was\nsufficiently interested to visit him and pay for his support. Who was\nthe child's mother and where was she?  Who was Nina Carrington?  Did\neither of them know where Halsey was or what had happened to him?\n\nOn the way home we passed the little cemetery where Thomas had been\nlaid to rest.  I wondered if Thomas could have helped us to find\nHalsey, had he lived.  Farther along was the more imposing\nburial-ground, where Arnold Armstrong and his father lay in the shadow\nof a tall granite shaft.  Of the three, I think Thomas was the only one\nsincerely mourned.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nA TRAMP AND THE TOOTHACHE\n\nThe bitterness toward the dead president of the Traders' Bank seemed to\ngrow with time.  Never popular, his memory was execrated by people who\nhad lost nothing, but who were filled with disgust by constantly\nhearing new stories of the man's grasping avarice.  The Traders' had\nbeen a favorite bank for small tradespeople, and in its savings\ndepartment it had solicited the smallest deposits.  People who had\nthought to be self-supporting to the last found themselves confronting\nthe poorhouse, their two or three hundred dollar savings wiped away.\nAll bank failures have this element, however, and the directors were\ntrying to promise twenty per cent. on deposits.\n\nBut, like everything else those days, the bank failure was almost\nforgotten by Gertrude and myself.  We did not mention Jack Bailey: I\nhad found nothing to change my impression of his guilt, and Gertrude\nknew how I felt.  As for the murder of the bank president's son, I was\nof two minds.  One day I thought Gertrude knew or at least suspected\nthat Jack had done it; the next I feared that it had been Gertrude\nherself, that night alone on the circular staircase.  And then the\nmother of Lucien Wallace would obtrude herself, and an almost equally\ngood case might be made against her.  There were times, of course, when\nI was disposed to throw all those suspicions aside, and fix definitely\non the unknown, whoever that might be.\n\nI had my greatest disappointment when it came to tracing Nina\nCarrington.  The woman had gone without leaving a trace.  Marked as she\nwas, it should have been easy to follow her, but she was not to be\nfound.  A description to one of the detectives, on my arrival at home,\nhad started the ball rolling.  But by night she had not been found.  I\ntold Gertrude, then, about the telegram to Louise when she had been ill\nbefore; about my visit to Doctor Walker, and my suspicions that Mattie\nBliss and Nina Carrington were the same.  She thought, as I did, that\nthere was little doubt of it.\n\nI said nothing to her, however, of the detective's suspicions about\nAlex.  Little things that I had not noticed at the time now came back\nto me.  I had an uncomfortable feeling that perhaps Alex was a spy, and\nthat by taking him into the house I had played into the enemy's hand.\nBut at eight o'clock that night Alex himself appeared, and with him a\nstrange and repulsive individual.  They made a queer pair, for Alex was\nalmost as disreputable as the tramp, and he had a badly swollen eye.\n\nGertrude had been sitting listlessly waiting for the evening message\nfrom Mr. Jamieson, but when the singular pair came in, as they did,\nwithout ceremony, she jumped up and stood staring. Winters, the\ndetective who watched the house at night, followed them, and kept his\neyes sharply on Alex's prisoner.  For that was the situation as it\ndeveloped.\n\nHe was a tall lanky individual, ragged and dirty, and just now he\nlooked both terrified and embarrassed.  Alex was too much engrossed to\nbe either, and to this day I don't think I ever asked him why he went\noff without permission the day before.\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" Alex began abruptly, \"this man can tell us something very\nimportant about the disappearance of Mr. Innes.  I found him trying to\nsell this watch.\"\n\nHe took a watch from his pocket and put it on the table.  It was\nHalsey's watch.  I had given it to him on his twenty-first birthday: I\nwas dumb with apprehension.\n\n\"He says he had a pair of cuff-links also, but he sold them--\"\n\n\"Fer a dollar'n half,\" put in the disreputable individual hoarsely,\nwith an eye on the detective.\n\n\"He is not--dead?\" I implored.  The tramp cleared his throat.\n\n\"No'm,\" he said huskily.  \"He was used up pretty bad, but he weren't\ndead.  He was comin' to hisself when I\"--he stopped and looked at the\ndetective.  \"I didn't steal it, Mr. Winters,\" he whined.  \"I found it\nin the road, honest to God, I did.\"\n\nMr. Winters paid no attention to him.  He was watching Alex.\n\n\"I'd better tell what he told me,\" Alex broke in.  \"It will be quicker.\nWhen Jamieson--when Mr. Jamieson calls up we can start him right.  Mr.\nWinters, I found this man trying to sell that watch on Fifth Street.\nHe offered it to me for three dollars.\"\n\n\"How did you know the watch?\" Winters snapped at him.\n\n\"I had seen it before, many times.  I used it at night when I was\nwatching at the foot of the staircase.\"  The detective was satisfied.\n\"When he offered the watch to me, I knew it, and I pretended I was\ngoing to buy it.  We went into an alley and I got the watch.\"  The\ntramp shivered.  It was plain how Alex had secured the watch.  \"Then--I\ngot the story from this fellow.  He claims to have seen the whole\naffair.  He says he was in an empty car--in the car the automobile\nstruck.\"\n\nThe tramp broke in here, and told his story, with frequent\ninterpretations by Alex and Mr. Winters.  He used a strange medley, in\nwhich familiar words took unfamiliar meanings, but it was gradually\nmade clear to us.\n\nOn the night in question the tramp had been \"pounding his ear\"--this\nstuck to me as being graphic--in an empty box-car along the siding at\nCasanova.  The train was going west, and due to leave at dawn.  The\ntramp and the \"brakey\" were friendly, and things going well.  About ten\no'clock, perhaps earlier, a terrific crash against the side of the car\nroused him.  He tried to open the door, but could not move it.  He got\nout of the other side, and just as he did so, he heard some one groan.\n\nThe habits of a lifetime made him cautious.  He slipped on to the\nbumper of a car and peered through.  An automobile had struck the car,\nand stood there on two wheels.  The tail lights were burning, but the\nheadlights were out.  Two men were stooping over some one who lay on\nthe ground.  Then the taller of the two started on a dog-trot along the\ntrain looking for an empty.  He found one four cars away and ran back\nagain.  The two lifted the unconscious man into the empty box-car, and,\ngetting in themselves, stayed for three or four minutes.  When they\ncame out, after closing the sliding door, they cut up over the railroad\nembankment toward the town.  One, the short one, seemed to limp.\n\nThe tramp was wary.  He waited for ten minutes or so.  Some women came\ndown a path to the road and inspected the automobile.  When they had\ngone, he crawled into the box-car and closed the door again.  Then he\nlighted a match.  The figure of a man, unconscious, gagged, and with\nhis hands tied, lay far at the end.\n\nThe tramp lost no time; he went through his pockets, found a little\nmoney and the cuff-links, and took them.  Then he loosened the gag--it\nhad been cruelly tight--and went his way, again closing the door of the\nbox-car.  Outside on the road he found the watch.  He got on the fast\nfreight east, some time after, and rode into the city.  He had sold the\ncuff-links, but on offering the watch to Alex he had been \"copped.\"\n\nThe story, with its cold recital of villainy, was done.  I hardly knew\nif I were more anxious, or less.  That it was Halsey, there could be no\ndoubt.  How badly he was hurt, how far he had been carried, were the\nquestions that demanded immediate answer.  But it was the first real\ninformation we had had; my boy had not been murdered outright.  But\ninstead of vague terrors there was now the real fear that he might be\nlying in some strange hospital receiving the casual attention commonly\ngiven to the charity cases.  Even this, had we known it, would have\nbeen paradise to the terrible truth.  I wake yet and feel myself cold\nand trembling with the horror of Halsey's situation for three days\nafter his disappearance.\n\nMr. Winters and Alex disposed of the tramp with a warning.  It was\nevident he had told us all he knew.  We had occasion, within a day or\ntwo, to be doubly thankful that we had given him his freedom.  When Mr.\nJamieson telephoned that night we had news for him; he told me what I\nhad not realized before--that it would not be possible to find Halsey\nat once, even with this clue.  The cars by this time, three days, might\nbe scattered over the Union.\n\nBut he said to keep on hoping, that it was the best news we had had.\nAnd in the meantime, consumed with anxiety as we were, things were\nhappening at the house in rapid succession.\n\nWe had one peaceful day--then Liddy took sick in the night.  I went in\nwhen I heard her groaning, and found her with a hot-water bottle to her\nface, and her right cheek swollen until it was glassy.\n\n\"Toothache?\" I asked, not too gently.  \"You deserve it.  A woman of\nyour age, who would rather go around with an exposed nerve in her head\nthan have the tooth pulled!  It would be over in a moment.\"\n\n\"So would hanging,\" Liddy protested, from behind the hot-water bottle.\n\nI was hunting around for cotton and laudanum.\n\n\"You have a tooth just like it yourself, Miss Rachel,\" she whimpered.\n\"And I'm sure Doctor Boyle's been trying to take it out for years.\"\n\nThere was no laudanum, and Liddy made a terrible fuss when I proposed\ncarbolic acid, just because I had put too much on the cotton once and\nburned her mouth.  I'm sure it never did her any permanent harm;\nindeed, the doctor said afterward that living on liquid diet had been a\nsplendid rest for her stomach.  But she would have none of the acid,\nand she kept me awake groaning, so at last I got up and went to\nGertrude's door.  To my surprise, it was locked.\n\nI went around by the hall and into her bedroom that way.  The bed was\nturned down, and her dressing-gown and night-dress lay ready in the\nlittle room next, but Gertrude was not there.  She had not undressed.\n\nI don't know what terrible thoughts came to me in the minute I stood\nthere.  Through the door I could hear Liddy grumbling, with a squeal\nnow and then when the pain stabbed harder.  Then, automatically, I got\nthe laudanum and went back to her.\n\nIt was fully a half-hour before Liddy's groans subsided.  At intervals\nI went to the door into the hall and looked out, but I saw and heard\nnothing suspicious.  Finally, when Liddy had dropped into a doze, I\neven ventured as far as the head of the circular staircase, but there\nfloated up to me only the even breathing of Winters, the night\ndetective, sleeping just inside the entry.  And then, far off, I heard\nthe rapping noise that had lured Louise down the staircase that other\nnight, two weeks before.  It was over my head, and very faint--three or\nfour short muffled taps, a pause, and then again, stealthily repeated.\n\nThe sound of Mr. Winters' breathing was comforting; with the thought\nthat there was help within call, something kept me from waking him.  I\ndid not move for a moment; ridiculous things Liddy had said about a\nghost--I am not at all superstitious, except, perhaps, in the middle of\nthe night, with everything dark--things like that came back to me.\nAlmost beside me was the clothes chute.  I could feel it, but I could\nsee nothing.  As I stood, listening intently, I heard a sound near me.\nIt was vague, indefinite.  Then it ceased; there was an uneasy movement\nand a grunt from the foot of the circular staircase, and silence again.\n\nI stood perfectly still, hardly daring to breathe.\n\nThen I knew I had been right.  Some one was stealthily-passing the head\nof the staircase and coming toward me in the dark.  I leaned against\nthe wall for support--my knees were giving way. The steps were close\nnow, and suddenly I thought of Gertrude.  Of course it was Gertrude.  I\nput out one hand in front of me, but I touched nothing.  My voice\nalmost refused me, but I managed to gasp out, \"Gertrude!\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" a man's voice exclaimed, just beside me.  And then I\ncollapsed.  I felt myself going, felt some one catch me, a horrible\nnausea--that was all I remembered.\n\nWhen I came to it was dawn.  I was lying on the bed in Louise's room,\nwith the cherub on the ceiling staring down at me, and there was a\nblanket from my own bed thrown over me.  I felt weak and dizzy, but I\nmanaged to get up and totter to the door.  At the foot of the circular\nstaircase Mr. Winters was still asleep. Hardly able to stand, I crept\nback to my room.  The door into Gertrude's room was no longer locked:\nshe was sleeping like a tired child.  And in my dressing-room Liddy\nhugged a cold hot-water bottle, and mumbled in her sleep.\n\n\"There's some things you can't hold with hand cuffs,\" she was muttering\nthickly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nA SCRAP OF PAPER\n\nFor the first time in twenty years, I kept my bed that day. Liddy was\nalarmed to the point of hysteria, and sent for Doctor Stewart just\nafter breakfast.  Gertrude spent the morning with me, reading\nsomething--I forget what.  I was too busy with my thoughts to listen.\nI had said nothing to the two detectives. If Mr. Jamieson had been\nthere, I should have told him everything, but I could not go to these\nstrange men and tell them my niece had been missing in the middle of\nthe night; that she had not gone to bed at all; that while I was\nsearching for her through the house, I had met a stranger who, when I\nfainted, had carried me into a room and left me there, to get better or\nnot, as it might happen.\n\nThe whole situation was terrible: had the issues been less vital, it\nwould have been absurd.  Here we were, guarded day and night by private\ndetectives, with an extra man to watch the grounds, and yet we might as\nwell have lived in a Japanese paper house, for all the protection we\nhad.\n\nAnd there was something else: the man I had met in the darkness had\nbeen even more startled than I, and about his voice, when he muttered\nhis muffled exclamation, there was something vaguely familiar.  All\nthat morning, while Gertrude read aloud, and Liddy watched for the\ndoctor, I was puzzling over that voice, without result.\n\nAnd there were other things, too.  I wondered what Gertrude's absence\nfrom her room had to do with it all, or if it had any connection.  I\ntried to think that she had heard the rapping noises before I did and\ngone to investigate, but I'm afraid I was a moral coward that day.  I\ncould not ask her.\n\nPerhaps the diversion was good for me.  It took my mind from Halsey,\nand the story we had heard the night before.  The day, however, was a\nlong vigil, with every ring of the telephone full of possibilities.\nDoctor Walker came up, some time just after luncheon, and asked for me.\n\n\"Go down and see him,\" I instructed Gertrude.  \"Tell him I am out--for\nmercy's sake don't say I'm sick.  Find out what he wants, and from this\ntime on, instruct the servants that he is not to be admitted.  I loathe\nthat man.\"\n\nGertrude came back very soon, her face rather flushed.\n\n\"He came to ask us to get out,\" she said, picking up her book with a\njerk.  \"He says Louise Armstrong wants to come here, now that she is\nrecovering.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\"\n\n\"I said we were very sorry we could not leave, but we would be\ndelighted to have Louise come up here with us.  He looked daggers at\nme.  And he wanted to know if we would recommend Eliza as a cook.  He\nhas brought a patient, a man, out from town, and is increasing his\nestablishment--that's the way he put it.\"\n\n\"I wish him joy of Eliza,\" I said tartly.  \"Did he ask for Halsey?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I told him that we were on the track last night, and that it was\nonly a question of time.  He said he was glad, although he didn't\nappear to be, but he said not to be too sanguine.\"\n\n\"Do you know what I believe?\" I asked.  \"I believe, as firmly as I\nbelieve anything, that Doctor Walker knows something about Halsey, and\nthat he could put his finger on him, if he wanted to.\"\n\nThere were several things that day that bewildered me.  About three\no'clock Mr. Jamieson telephoned from the Casanova station and Warner\nwent down to meet him.  I got up and dressed hastily, and the detective\nwas shown up to my sitting-room.\n\n\"No news?\" I asked, as he entered.  He tried to look encouraging,\nwithout success.  I noticed that he looked tired and dusty, and,\nalthough he was ordinarily impeccable in his appearance, it was clear\nthat he was at least two days from a razor.\n\n\"It won't be long now, Miss Innes,\" he said.  \"I have come out here on\na peculiar errand, which I will tell you about later. First, I want to\nask some questions.  Did any one come out here yesterday to repair the\ntelephone, and examine the wires on the roof?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said promptly; \"but it was not the telephone.  He said the\nwiring might have caused the fire at the stable.  I went up with him\nmyself, but he only looked around.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson smiled.\n\n\"Good for you!\" he applauded.  \"Don't allow any one in the house that\nyou don't trust, and don't trust anybody.  All are not electricians who\nwear rubber gloves.\"\n\nHe refused to explain further, but he got a slip of paper out of his\npocketbook and opened it carefully.\n\n\"Listen,\" he said.  \"You heard this before and scoffed.  In the light\nof recent developments I want you to read it again.  You are a clever\nwoman, Miss Innes.  Just as surely as I sit here, there is something in\nthis house that is wanted very anxiously by a number of people.  The\nlines are closing up, Miss Innes.\"\n\nThe paper was the one he had found among Arnold Armstrong's effects,\nand I read it again:\n\n\n\"----by altering the plans for----rooms, may be possible.  The best\nway, in my opinion, would be to----the plan for----in one of\nthe----rooms----chimney.\"\n\n\n\"I think I understand,\" I said slowly.  \"Some one is searching for the\nsecret room, and the invaders--\"\n\n\"And the holes in the plaster--\"\n\n\"Have been in the progress of his--\"\n\n\"Or her--investigations.\"\n\n\"Her?\" I asked.\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" the detective said, getting up, \"I believe that somewhere\nin the walls of this house is hidden some of the money, at least, from\nthe Traders' Bank.  I believe, just as surely, that young Walker\nbrought home from California the knowledge of something of the sort\nand, failing in his effort to reinstall Mrs. Armstrong and her daughter\nhere, he, or a confederate, has tried to break into the house.  On two\noccasions I think he succeeded.\"\n\n\"On three, at least,\" I corrected.  And then I told him about the night\nbefore.  \"I have been thinking hard,\" I concluded, \"and I do not\nbelieve the man at the head of the circular staircase was Doctor\nWalker.  I don't think he could have got in, and the voice was not his.\"\n\nMr. Jamieson got up and paced the floor, his hands behind him.\n\n\"There is something else that puzzles me,\" he said, stepping before me.\n\"Who and what is the woman Nina Carrington?  If it was she who came\nhere as Mattie Bliss, what did she tell Halsey that sent him racing to\nDoctor Walker's, and then to Miss Armstrong?  If we could find that\nwoman we would have the whole thing.\"\n\n\"Mr. Jamieson, did you ever think that Paul Armstrong might not have\ndied a natural death?\"\n\n\"That is the thing we are going to try to find out,\" he replied.  And\nthen Gertrude came in, announcing a man below to see Mr. Jamieson.\n\n\"I want you present at this interview, Miss Innes,\" he said. \"May Riggs\ncome up?  He has left Doctor Walker and he has something he wants to\ntell us.\"\n\nRiggs came into the room diffidently, but Mr. Jamieson put him at his\nease.  He kept a careful eye on me, however, and slid into a chair by\nthe door when he was asked to sit down.\n\n\"Now, Riggs,\" began Mr. Jamieson kindly.  \"You are to say what you have\nto say before this lady.\"\n\n\"You promised you'd keep it quiet, Mr. Jamieson.\"  Riggs plainly did\nnot trust me.  There was nothing friendly in the glance he turned on me.\n\n\"Yes, yes.  You will be protected.  But, first of all, did you bring\nwhat you promised?\"\n\nRiggs produced a roll of papers from under his coat, and handed them\nover.  Mr. Jamieson examined them with lively satisfaction, and passed\nthem to me.  \"The blue-prints of Sunnyside,\" he said. \"What did I tell\nyou?  Now, Riggs, we are ready.\"\n\n\"I'd never have come to you, Mr. Jamieson,\" he began, \"if it hadn't\nbeen for Miss Armstrong.  When Mr. Innes was spirited away, like, and\nMiss Louise got sick because of it, I thought things had gone far\nenough.  I'd done some things for the doctor before that wouldn't just\nbear looking into, but I turned a bit squeamish.\"\n\n\"Did you help with that?\" I asked, leaning forward.\n\n\"No, ma'm.  I didn't even know of it until the next day, when it came\nout in the Casanova Weekly Ledger.  But I know who did it, all right.\nI'd better start at the beginning.\n\n\"When Doctor Walker went away to California with the Armstrong family,\nthere was talk in the town that when he came back he would be married\nto Miss Armstrong, and we all expected it. First thing I knew, I got a\nletter from him, in the west.  He seemed to be excited, and he said\nMiss Armstrong had taken a sudden notion to go home and he sent me some\nmoney.  I was to watch for her, to see if she went to Sunnyside, and\nwherever she was, not to lose sight of her until he got home.  I traced\nher to the lodge, and I guess I scared you on the drive one night, Miss\nInnes.\"\n\n\"And Rosie!\" I ejaculated.\n\nRiggs grinned sheepishly.\n\n\"I only wanted to make sure Miss Louise was there.  Rosie started to\nrun, and I tried to stop her and tell her some sort of a story to\naccount for my being there.  But she wouldn't wait.\"\n\n\"And the broken china--in the basket?\"\n\n\"Well, broken china's death to rubber tires,\" he said.  \"I hadn't any\ncomplaint against you people here, and the Dragon Fly was a good car.\"\n\nSo Rosie's highwayman was explained.\n\n\"Well, I telegraphed the doctor where Miss Louise was and I kept an eye\non her.  Just a day or so before they came home with the body, I got\nanother letter, telling me to watch for a woman who had been pitted\nwith smallpox.  Her name was Carrington, and the doctor made things\npretty strong.  If I found any such woman loafing around, I was not to\nlose sight of her for a minute until the doctor got back.\n\n\"Well, I would have had my hands full, but the other woman didn't show\nup for a good while, and when she did the doctor was home.\"\n\n\"Riggs,\" I asked suddenly, \"did you get into this house a day or two\nafter I took it, at night?\"\n\n\"I did not, Miss Innes.  I have never been in the house before. Well,\nthe Carrington woman didn't show up until the night Mr. Halsey\ndisappeared.  She came to the office late, and the doctor was out.  She\nwaited around, walking the floor and working herself into a passion.\nWhen the doctor didn't come back, she was in an awful way.  She wanted\nme to hunt him, and when he didn't appear, she called him names; said\nhe couldn't fool her. There was murder being done, and she would see\nhim swing for it.\n\n\"She struck me as being an ugly customer, and when she left, about\neleven o'clock, and went across to the Armstrong place, I was not far\nbehind her.  She walked all around the house first, looking up at the\nwindows.  Then she rang the bell, and the minute the door was opened\nshe was through it, and into the hall.\"\n\n\"How long did she stay?\"\n\n\"That's the queer part of it,\" Riggs said eagerly.  \"She didn't come\nout that night at all.  I went to bed at daylight, and that was the\nlast I heard of her until the next day, when I saw her on a truck at\nthe station, covered with a sheet.  She'd been struck by the express\nand you would hardly have known her--dead, of course.  I think she\nstayed all night in the Armstrong house, and the agent said she was\ncrossing the track to take the up-train to town when the express struck\nher.\"\n\n\"Another circle!\" I exclaimed.  \"Then we are just where we started.\"\n\n\"Not so bad as that, Miss Innes,\" Riggs said eagerly.  \"Nina Carrington\ncame from the town in California where Mr. Armstrong died.  Why was the\ndoctor so afraid of her?  The Carrington woman knew something.  I lived\nwith Doctor Walker seven years, and I know him well.  There are few\nthings he is afraid of.  I think he killed Mr. Armstrong out in the\nwest somewhere, that's what I think.  What else he did I don't\nknow--but he dismissed me and pretty nearly throttled me--for telling\nMr. Jamieson here about Mr. Innes' having been at his office the night\nhe disappeared, and about my hearing them quarreling.\"\n\n\"What was it Warner overheard the woman say to Mr. Innes, in the\nlibrary?\" the detective asked me.\n\n\"She said 'I knew there was something wrong from the start.  A man\nisn't well one day and dead the next without some reason.'\"\n\nHow perfectly it all seemed to fit!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nWHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN\n\nIt was on Wednesday Riggs told us the story of his connection with some\nincidents that had been previously unexplained.  Halsey had been gone\nsince the Friday night before, and with the passage of each day I felt\nthat his chances were lessening.  I knew well enough that he might be\ncarried thousands of miles in the box-car, locked in, perhaps, without\nwater or food.  I had read of cases where bodies had been found locked\nin cars on isolated sidings in the west, and my spirits went down with\nevery hour.\n\nHis recovery was destined to be almost as sudden as his disappearance,\nand was due directly to the tramp Alex had brought to Sunnyside.  It\nseems the man was grateful for his release, and when he learned some\nthing of Halsey's whereabouts from another member of his\nfraternity--for it is a fraternity--he was prompt in letting us know.\n\nOn Wednesday evening Mr. Jamieson, who had been down at the Armstrong\nhouse trying to see Louise--and failing--was met near the gate at\nSunnyside by an individual precisely as repulsive and unkempt as the\none Alex had captured.  The man knew the detective, and he gave him a\npiece of dirty paper, on which was scrawled the words--\"He's at City\nHospital, Johnsville.\"  The tramp who brought the paper pretended to\nknow nothing, except this: the paper had been passed along from a\n\"hobo\" in Johnsville, who seemed to know the information would be\nvaluable to us.\n\nAgain the long distance telephone came into requisition.  Mr. Jamieson\ncalled the hospital, while we crowded around him.  And when there was\nno longer any doubt that it was Halsey, and that he would probably\nrecover, we all laughed and cried together.  I am sure I kissed Liddy,\nand I have had terrible moments since when I seem to remember kissing\nMr. Jamieson, too, in the excitement.\n\nAnyhow, by eleven o'clock that night Gertrude was on her way to\nJohnsville, three hundred and eighty miles away, accompanied by Rosie.\nThe domestic force was now down to Mary Anne and Liddy, with the\nunder-gardener's wife coming every day to help out. Fortunately, Warner\nand the detectives were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge.  Out of\ndeference to Liddy they washed their dishes once a day, and they\nconcocted queer messes, according to their several abilities.  They had\none triumph that they ate regularly for breakfast, and that clung to\ntheir clothes and their hair the rest of the day.  It was bacon,\nhardtack and onions, fried together.  They were almost pathetically\ngrateful, however, I noticed, for an occasional broiled tenderloin.\n\nIt was not until Gertrude and Rosie had gone and Sunnyside had settled\ndown for the night, with Winters at the foot of the staircase, that Mr.\nJamieson broached a subject he had evidently planned before he came.\n\n\"Miss Innes,\" he said, stopping me as I was about to go to my room\nup-stairs, \"how are your nerves tonight?\"\n\n\"I have none,\" I said happily.  \"With Halsey found, my troubles have\ngone.\"\n\n\"I mean,\" he persisted, \"do you feel as though you could go through\nwith something rather unusual?\"\n\n\"The most unusual thing I can think of would be a peaceful night.  But\nif anything is going to occur, don't dare to let me miss it.\"\n\n\"Something is going to occur,\" he said.  \"And you're the only woman I\ncan think of that I can take along.\"  He looked at his watch.  \"Don't\nask me any questions, Miss Innes.  Put on heavy shoes, and some old\ndark clothes, and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything.\"\n\nLiddy was sleeping the sleep of the just when I went up-stairs, and I\nhunted out my things cautiously.  The detective was waiting in the\nhall, and I was astonished to see Doctor Stewart with him.\n\nThey were talking confidentially together, but when I came down they\nceased.  There were a few preparations to be made: the locks to be gone\nover, Winters to be instructed as to renewed vigilance, and then, after\nextinguishing the hall light, we crept, in the darkness, through the\nfront door, and into the night.\n\nI asked no questions.  I felt that they were doing me honor in making\nme one of the party, and I would show them I could be as silent as\nthey.  We went across the fields, passing through the woods that\nreached almost to the ruins of the stable, going over stiles now and\nthen, and sometimes stepping over low fences. Once only somebody spoke,\nand then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from Doctor Stewart when\nhe ran into a wire fence.\n\nWe were joined at the end of five minutes by another man, who fell into\nstep with the doctor silently.  He carried something over his shoulder\nwhich I could not make out.  In this way we walked for perhaps twenty\nminutes.  I had lost all sense of direction: I merely stumbled along in\nsilence, allowing Mr. Jamieson to guide me this way or that as the path\ndemanded.  I hardly know what I expected.  Once, when through a\nmiscalculation I jumped a little short over a ditch and landed above my\nshoe-tops in the water and ooze, I remember wondering if this were\nreally I, and if I had ever tasted life until that summer.  I walked\nalong with the water sloshing in my boots, and I was actually cheerful.\nI remember whispering to Mr. Jamieson that I had never seen the stars\nso lovely, and that it was a mistake, when the Lord had made the night\nso beautiful, to sleep through it!\n\nThe doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt. I\nconfess that just at that minute even Sunnyside seemed a cheerful spot.\nWe had paused at the edge of a level cleared place, bordered all around\nwith primly trimmed evergreen trees.  Between them I caught a glimpse\nof starlight shining down on rows of white headstones and an occasional\nmore imposing monument, or towering shaft.  In spite of myself, I drew\nmy breath in sharply.  We were on the edge of the Casanova churchyard.\n\nI saw now both the man who had joined the party and the implements he\ncarried.  It was Alex, armed with two long-handled spades.  After the\nfirst shock of surprise, I flatter myself I was both cool and quiet.\nWe went in single file between the rows of headstones, and although,\nwhen I found myself last, I had an instinctive desire to keep looking\nback over my shoulder, I found that, the first uneasiness past, a\ncemetery at night is much the same as any other country place, filled\nwith vague shadows and unexpected noises.  Once, indeed--but Mr.\nJamieson said it was an owl, and I tried to believe him.\n\nIn the shadow of the Armstrong granite shaft we stopped.  I think the\ndoctor wanted to send me back.\n\n\"It's no place for a woman,\" I heard him protesting angrily.  But the\ndetective said something about witnesses, and the doctor only came over\nand felt my pulse.\n\n\"Anyhow, I don't believe you're any worse off here than you would be in\nthat nightmare of a house,\" he said finally, and put his coat on the\nsteps of the shaft for me to sit on.\n\nThere is an air of finality about a grave: one watches the earth thrown\nin, with the feeling that this is the end.  Whatever has gone before,\nwhatever is to come in eternity, that particular temple of the soul has\nbeen given back to the elements from which it came.  Thus, there is a\nsense of desecration, of a reversal of the everlasting fitness of\nthings, in resurrecting a body from its mother clay.  And yet that\nnight, in the Casanova churchyard, I sat quietly by, and watched Alex\nand Mr. Jamieson steaming over their work, without a single qualm,\nexcept the fear of detection.\n\nThe doctor kept a keen lookout, but no one appeared.  Once in a while\nhe came over to me, and gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder.\n\n\"I never expected to come to this,\" he said once.  \"There's one thing\nsure--I'll not be suspected of complicity.  A doctor is generally\nsupposed to be handier at burying folks than at digging them up.\"\n\nThe uncanny moment came when Alex and Jamieson tossed the spades on the\ngrass, and I confess I hid my face.  There was a period of stress, I\nthink, while the heavy coffin was being raised.  I felt that my\ncomposure was going, and, for fear I would shriek, I tried to think of\nsomething else--what time Gertrude would reach Halsey--anything but the\ngrisly reality that lay just beyond me on the grass.\n\nAnd then I heard a low exclamation from the detective and I felt the\npressure of the doctor's fingers on my arm.\n\n\"Now, Miss Innes,\" he said gently.  \"If you will come over--\"\n\nI held on to him frantically, and somehow I got there and looked down.\nThe lid of the casket had been raised and a silver plate on it proved\nwe had made no mistake.  But the face that showed in the light of the\nlantern was a face I had never seen before.  The man who lay before us\nwas not Paul Armstrong!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nBETWEEN TWO FIREPLACES\n\nWhat with the excitement of the discovery, the walk home under the\nstars in wet shoes and draggled skirts, and getting up-stairs and\nundressed without rousing Liddy, I was completely used up. What to do\nwith my boots was the greatest puzzle of all, there being no place in\nthe house safe from Liddy, until I decided to slip upstairs the next\nmorning and drop them into the hole the \"ghost\" had made in the\ntrunk-room wall.\n\nI went asleep as soon as I reached this decision, and in my dreams I\nlived over again the events of the night.  Again I saw the group around\nthe silent figure on the grass, and again, as had happened at the\ngrave, I heard Alex's voice, tense and triumphant:\n\n\"Then we've got them,\" he said.  Only, in my dreams, he said it over\nand over until he seemed to shriek it in my ears.\n\nI wakened early, in spite of my fatigue, and lay there thinking. Who\nwas Alex?  I no longer believed that he was a gardener.  Who was the\nman whose body we had resurrected?  And where was Paul Armstrong?\nProbably living safely in some extraditionless country on the fortune\nhe had stolen.  Did Louise and her mother know of the shameful and\nwicked deception?  What had Thomas known, and Mrs. Watson?  Who was\nNina Carrington?\n\nThis last question, it seemed to me, was answered.  In some way the\nwoman had learned of the substitution, and had tried to use her\nknowledge for blackmail.  Nina Carrington's own story died with her,\nbut, however it happened, it was clear that she had carried her\nknowledge to Halsey the afternoon Gertrude and I were looking for clues\nto the man I had shot on the east veranda. Halsey had been half crazed\nby what he heard; it was evident that Louise was marrying Doctor Walker\nto keep the shameful secret, for her mother's sake.  Halsey, always\nreckless, had gone at once to Doctor Walker and denounced him.  There\nhad been a scene, and he left on his way to the station to meet and\nnotify Mr. Jamieson of what he had learned.  The doctor was active\nmentally and physically.  Accompanied perhaps by Riggs, who had shown\nhimself not overscrupulous until he quarreled with his employer, he had\ngone across to the railroad embankment, and, by jumping in front of the\ncar, had caused Halsey to swerve.  The rest of the story we knew.\n\nThat was my reconstructed theory of that afternoon and evening: it was\nalmost correct--not quite.\n\nThere was a telegram that morning from Gertrude.\n\n\n\"Halsey conscious and improving.  Probably home in day or so.\n                                            GERTRUDE.\"\n\n\nWith Halsey found and improving in health, and with at last something\nto work on, I began that day, Thursday, with fresh courage.  As Mr.\nJamieson had said, the lines were closing up. That I was to be caught\nand almost finished in the closing was happily unknown to us all.\n\nIt was late when I got up.  I lay in my bed, looking around the four\nwalls of the room, and trying to imagine behind what one of them a\nsecret chamber might lie.  Certainly, in daylight, Sunnyside deserved\nits name: never was a house more cheery and open, less sinister in\ngeneral appearance.  There was not a corner apparently that was not\nopen and above-board, and yet, somewhere behind its handsomely papered\nwalls I believed firmly that there lay a hidden room, with all the\npossibilities it would involve.\n\nI made a mental note to have the house measured during the day, to\ndiscover any discrepancy between the outer and inner walls, and I tried\nto recall again the exact wording of the paper Jamieson had found.\n\nThe slip had said \"chimney.\"  It was the only clue, and a house as\nlarge as Sunnyside was full of them.  There was an open fireplace in my\ndressing-room, but none in the bedroom, and as I lay there, looking\naround, I thought of something that made me sit up suddenly.  The\ntrunk-room, just over my head, had an open fireplace and a brick\nchimney, and yet, there was nothing of the kind in my room.  I got out\nof bed and examined the opposite wall closely.  There was apparently no\nflue, and I knew there was none in the hall just beneath.  The house\nwas heated by steam, as I have said before.  In the living-room was a\nhuge open fireplace, but it was on the other side.\n\nWhy did the trunk-room have both a radiator and an open fireplace?\nArchitects were not usually erratic!  It was not fifteen minutes before\nI was up-stairs, armed with a tape-measure in lieu of a foot-rule,\neager to justify Mr. Jamieson's opinion of my intelligence, and firmly\nresolved not to tell him of my suspicion until I had more than theory\nto go on.  The hole in the trunk-room wall still yawned there, between\nthe chimney and the outer wall.  I examined it again, with no new\nresult. The space between the brick wall and the plaster and lath one,\nhowever, had a new significance.  The hole showed only one side of the\nchimney, and I determined to investigate what lay in the space on the\nother side of the mantel.\n\nI worked feverishly.  Liddy had gone to the village to market, it being\nher firm belief that the store people sent short measure unless she\nwatched the scales, and that, since the failure of the Traders' Bank,\nwe must watch the corners; and I knew that what I wanted to do must be\ndone before she came back.  I had no tools, but after rummaging around\nI found a pair of garden scissors and a hatchet, and thus armed, I set\nto work.  The plaster came out easily: the lathing was more obstinate.\nIt gave under the blows, only to spring back into place again, and the\nnecessity for caution made it doubly hard.\n\nI had a blister on my palm when at last the hatchet went through and\nfell with what sounded like the report of a gun to my overstrained\nnerves.  I sat on a trunk, waiting to hear Liddy fly up the stairs,\nwith the household behind her, like the tail of a comet.  But nothing\nhappened, and with a growing feeling of uncanniness I set to work\nenlarging the opening.\n\nThe result was absolutely nil.  When I could hold a lighted candle in\nthe opening, I saw precisely what I had seen on the other side of the\nchimney--a space between the true wall and the false one, possibly\nseven feet long and about three feet wide. It was in no sense of the\nword a secret chamber, and it was evident it had not been disturbed\nsince the house was built.  It was a supreme disappointment.\n\nIt had been Mr. Jamieson's idea that the hidden room, if there was one,\nwould be found somewhere near the circular staircase. In fact, I knew\nthat he had once investigated the entire length of the clothes chute,\nhanging to a rope, with this in view.  I was reluctantly about to\nconcede that he had been right, when my eyes fell on the mantel and\nfireplace.  The latter had evidently never been used: it was closed\nwith a metal fire front, and only when the front refused to move, and\ninvestigation showed that it was not intended to be moved, did my\nspirits revive.\n\nI hurried into the next room.  Yes, sure enough, there was a similar\nmantel and fireplace there, similarly closed.  In both rooms the\nchimney flue extended well out from the wall.  I measured with the\ntape-line, my hands trembling so that I could scarcely hold it.  They\nextended two feet and a half into each room, which, with the three feet\nof space between the two partitions, made eight feet to be accounted\nfor.  Eight feet in one direction and almost seven in the other--what a\nchimney it was!\n\nBut I had only located the hidden room.  I was not in it, and no amount\nof pressing on the carving of the wooden mantels, no search of the\nfloors for loose boards, none of the customary methods availed at all.\nThat there was a means of entrance, and probably a simple one, I could\nbe certain.  But what?  What would I find if I did get in?  Was the\ndetective right, and were the bonds and money from the Traders' Bank\nthere?  Or was our whole theory wrong?  Would not Paul Armstrong have\ntaken his booty with him?  If he had not, and if Doctor Walker was in\nthe secret, he would have known how to enter the chimney room.\nThen--who had dug the other hole in the false partition?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nANNE WATSON'S STORY\n\nLiddy discovered the fresh break in the trunk-room wall while we were\nat luncheon, and ran shrieking down the stairs.  She maintained that,\nas she entered, unseen hands had been digging at the plaster; that they\nhad stopped when she went in, and she had felt a gust of cold damp air.\nIn support of her story she carried in my wet and muddy boots, that I\nhad unluckily forgotten to hide, and held them out to the detective and\nmyself.\n\n\"What did I tell you?\" she said dramatically.  \"Look at 'em. They're\nyours, Miss Rachel--and covered with mud and soaked to the tops.  I\ntell you, you can scoff all you like; something has been wearing your\nshoes.  As sure as you sit there, there's the smell of the graveyard on\nthem.  How do we know they weren't tramping through the Casanova\nchurchyard last night, and sitting on the graves!\"\n\nMr. Jamieson almost choked to death.  \"I wouldn't be at all surprised\nif they were doing that very thing, Liddy,\" he said, when he got his\nbreath.  \"They certainly look like it.\"\n\nI think the detective had a plan, on which he was working, and which\nwas meant to be a coup.  But things went so fast there was no time to\ncarry it into effect.  The first thing that occurred was a message from\nthe Charity Hospital that Mrs. Watson was dying, and had asked for me.\nI did not care much about going.  There is a sort of melancholy\npleasure to be had out of a funeral, with its pomp and ceremony, but I\nshrank from a death-bed. However, Liddy got out the black things and\nthe crape veil I keep for such occasions, and I went.  I left Mr.\nJamieson and the day detective going over every inch of the circular\nstaircase, pounding, probing and measuring.  I was inwardly elated to\nthink of the surprise I was going to give them that night; as it turned\nout, I DID surprise them almost into spasms.\n\nI drove from the train to the Charity Hospital, and was at once taken\nto a ward.  There, in a gray-walled room in a high iron bed, lay Mrs.\nWatson.  She was very weak, and she only opened her eyes and looked at\nme when I sat down beside her.  I was conscience-stricken.  We had been\nso engrossed that I had left this poor creature to die without even a\nword of sympathy.\n\nThe nurse gave her a stimulant, and in a little while she was able to\ntalk.  So broken and half-coherent, however, was her story that I shall\ntell it in my own way.  In an hour from the time I entered the Charity\nHospital, I had heard a sad and pitiful narrative, and had seen a woman\nslip into the unconsciousness that is only a step from death.\n\nBriefly, then, the housekeeper's story was this:\n\nShe was almost forty years old, and had been the sister-mother of a\nlarge family of children.  One by one they had died, and been buried\nbeside their parents in a little town in the Middle West. There was\nonly one sister left, the baby, Lucy.  On her the older girl had\nlavished all the love of an impulsive and emotional nature.  When Anne,\nthe elder, was thirty-two and Lucy was nineteen, a young man had come\nto the town.  He was going east, after spending the summer at a\ncelebrated ranch in Wyoming--one of those places where wealthy men send\nworthless and dissipated sons, for a season of temperance, fresh air\nand hunting.  The sisters, of course, knew nothing of this, and the\nyoung man's ardor rather carried them away.  In a word, seven years\nbefore, Lucy Haswell had married a young man whose name was given as\nAubrey Wallace.\n\nAnne Haswell had married a carpenter in her native town, and was a\nwidow.  For three months everything went fairly well.  Aubrey took his\nbride to Chicago, where they lived at a hotel.  Perhaps the very\nunsophistication that had charmed him in Valley Mill jarred on him in\nthe city.  He had been far from a model husband, even for the three\nmonths, and when he disappeared Anne was almost thankful.  It was\ndifferent with the young wife, however. She drooped and fretted, and on\nthe birth of her baby boy, she had died.  Anne took the child, and\nnamed him Lucien.\n\nAnne had had no children of her own, and on Lucien she had lavished all\nher aborted maternal instinct.  On one thing she was determined,\nhowever: that was that Aubrey Wallace should educate his boy.  It was a\npart of her devotion to the child that she should be ambitious for him:\nhe must have every opportunity.  And so she came east.  She drifted\naround, doing plain sewing and keeping a home somewhere always for the\nboy.  Finally, however, she realized that her only training had been\ndomestic, and she put the boy in an Episcopalian home, and secured the\nposition of housekeeper to the Armstrongs.  There she found Lucien's\nfather, this time under his own name.  It was Arnold Armstrong.\n\nI gathered that there was no particular enmity at that time in Anne's\nmind.  She told him of the boy, and threatened exposure if he did not\nprovide for him.  Indeed, for a time, he did so.  Then he realized that\nLucien was the ruling passion in this lonely woman's life.  He found\nout where the child was hidden, and threatened to take him away.  Anne\nwas frantic.  The positions became reversed.  Where Arnold had given\nmoney for Lucien's support, as the years went on he forced money from\nAnne Watson instead until she was always penniless.  The lower Arnold\nsank in the scale, the heavier his demands became.  With the rupture\nbetween him and his family, things were worse.  Anne took the child\nfrom the home and hid him in a farmhouse near Casanova, on the\nClaysburg road.  There she went sometimes to see the boy, and there he\nhad taken fever.  The people were Germans, and he called the farmer's\nwife Grossmutter.  He had grown into a beautiful boy, and he was all\nAnne had to live for.\n\n\nThe Armstrongs left for California, and Arnold's persecutions began\nanew.  He was furious over the child's disappearance and she was afraid\nhe would do her some hurt.  She left the big house and went down to the\nlodge.  When I had rented Sunnyside, however, she had thought the\npersecutions would stop.  She had applied for the position of\nhousekeeper, and secured it.\n\nThat had been on Saturday.  That night Louise arrived unexpectedly.\nThomas sent for Mrs. Watson and then went for Arnold Armstrong at the\nGreenwood Club.  Anne had been fond of Louise--she reminded her of\nLucy.  She did not know what the trouble was, but Louise had been in a\nstate of terrible excitement.  Mrs. Watson tried to hide from Arnold,\nbut he was ugly.  He left the lodge and went up to the house about\ntwo-thirty, was admitted at the east entrance and came out again very\nsoon.  Something had occurred, she didn't know what; but very soon Mr.\nInnes and another gentleman left, using the car.\n\nThomas and she had got Louise quiet, and a little before three, Mrs.\nWatson started up to the house.  Thomas had a key to the east entry,\nand gave it to her.\n\nOn the way across the lawn she was confronted by Arnold, who for some\nreason was determined to get into the house.  He had a golf-stick in\nhis hand, that he had picked up somewhere, and on her refusal he had\nstruck her with it.  One hand had been badly cut, and it was that,\npoisoning having set in, which was killing her.  She broke away in a\nfrenzy of rage and fear, and got into the house while Gertrude and Jack\nBailey were at the front door. She went up-stairs, hardly knowing what\nshe was doing. Gertrude's door was open, and Halsey's revolver lay\nthere on the bed.  She picked it up and turning, ran part way down the\ncircular staircase.  She could hear Arnold fumbling at the lock\noutside.  She slipped down quietly and opened the door: he was inside\nbefore she had got back to the stairs.  It was quite dark, but she\ncould see his white shirt-bosom.  From the fourth step she fired.  As\nhe fell, somebody in the billiard-room screamed and ran.  When the\nalarm was raised, she had had no time to get up-stairs: she hid in the\nwest wing until every one was down on the lower floor.  Then she\nslipped upstairs, and threw the revolver out of an upper window, going\ndown again in time to admit the men from the Greenwood Club.\n\nIf Thomas had suspected, he had never told.  When she found the hand\nArnold had injured was growing worse, she gave the address of Lucien at\nRichfield to the old man, and almost a hundred dollars.  The money was\nfor Lucien's board until she recovered.  She had sent for me to ask me\nif I would try to interest the Armstrongs in the child.  When she found\nherself growing worse, she had written to Mrs. Armstrong, telling her\nnothing but that Arnold's legitimate child was at Richfield, and\nimploring her to recognize him.  She was dying: the boy was an\nArmstrong, and entitled to his father's share of the estate.  The\npapers were in her trunk at Sunnyside, with letters from the dead man\nthat would prove what she said.  She was going; she would not be judged\nby earthly laws; and somewhere else perhaps Lucy would plead for her.\nIt was she who had crept down the circular staircase, drawn by a\nmagnet, that night Mr. Jamieson had heard some one there.  Pursued, she\nhad fled madly, anywhere--through the first door she came to.  She had\nfallen down the clothes chute, and been saved by the basket beneath.  I\ncould have cried with relief; then it had not been Gertrude, after all!\n\nThat was the story.  Sad and tragic though it was, the very telling of\nit seemed to relieve the dying woman.  She did not know that Thomas was\ndead, and I did not tell her.  I promised to look after little Lucien,\nand sat with her until the intervals of consciousness grew shorter and\nfinally ceased altogether.  She died that night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nAT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS\n\nAs I drove rapidly up to the house from Casanova Station in the hack, I\nsaw the detective Burns loitering across the street from the Walker\nplace.  So Jamieson was putting the screws on--lightly now, but ready\nto give them a twist or two, I felt certain, very soon.\n\nThe house was quiet.  Two steps of the circular staircase had been\npried off, without result, and beyond a second message from Gertrude,\nthat Halsey insisted on coming home and they would arrive that night,\nthere was nothing new.  Mr. Jamieson, having failed to locate the\nsecret room, had gone to the village.  I learned afterwards that he\ncalled at Doctor Walker's, under pretense of an attack of acute\nindigestion, and before he left, had inquired about the evening trains\nto the city.  He said he had wasted a lot of time on the case, and a\ngood bit of the mystery was in my imagination!  The doctor was under\nthe impression that the house was guarded day and night.  Well, give a\nplace a reputation like that, and you don't need a guard at all,--thus\nJamieson.  And sure enough, late in the afternoon, the two private\ndetectives, accompanied by Mr. Jamieson, walked down the main street of\nCasanova and took a city-bound train.\n\nThat they got off at the next station and walked back again to\nSunnyside at dusk, was not known at the time.  Personally, I knew\nnothing of either move; I had other things to absorb me at that time.\n\nLiddy brought me some tea while I rested after my trip, and on the tray\nwas a small book from the Casanova library.  It was called The Unseen\nWorld and had a cheerful cover on which a half-dozen sheeted figures\nlinked hands around a headstone.\n\nAt this point in my story, Halsey always says:  \"Trust a woman to add\ntwo and two together, and make six.\"  To which I retort that if two and\ntwo plus X make six, then to discover the unknown quantity is the\nsimplest thing in the world.  That a houseful of detectives missed it\nentirely was because they were busy trying to prove that two and two\nmake four.\n\nThe depression due to my visit to the hospital left me at the prospect\nof seeing Halsey again that night.  It was about five o'clock when\nLiddy left me for a nap before dinner, having put me into a gray silk\ndressing-gown and a pair of slippers.  I listened to her retreating\nfootsteps, and as soon as she was safely below stairs, I went up to the\ntrunk-room.  The place had not been disturbed, and I proceeded at once\nto try to discover the entrance to the hidden room.  The openings on\neither side, as I have said, showed nothing but perhaps three feet of\nbrick wall.\n\nThere was no sign of an entrance--no levers, no hinges, to give a hint.\nEither the mantel or the roof, I decided, and after a half-hour at the\nmantel, productive of absolutely no result, I decided to try the roof.\n\nI am not fond of a height.  The few occasions on which I have climbed a\nstep-ladder have always left me dizzy and weak in the knees.  The top\nof the Washington monument is as impossible to me as the elevation of\nthe presidential chair.  And yet--I climbed out on to the Sunnyside\nroof without a second's hesitation.  Like a dog on a scent, like my\nbearskin progenitor, with his spear and his wild boar, to me now there\nwas the lust of the chase, the frenzy of pursuit, the dust of battle.\nI got quite a little of the latter on me as I climbed from the\nunfinished ball-room out through a window to the roof of the east wing\nof the building, which was only two stories in height.\n\nOnce out there, access to the top of the main building was rendered\neasy--at least it looked easy--by a small vertical iron ladder,\nfastened to the wall outside of the ball-room, and perhaps twelve feet\nhigh.  The twelve feet looked short from below, but they were difficult\nto climb.  I gathered my silk gown around me, and succeeded finally in\nmaking the top of the ladder.\n\nOnce there, however, I was completely out of breath.  I sat down, my\nfeet on the top rung, and put my hair pins in more securely, while the\nwind bellowed my dressing-gown out like a sail.  I had torn a great\nstrip of the silk loose, and now I ruthlessly finished the destruction\nof my gown by jerking it free and tying it around my head.\n\nFrom far below the smallest sounds came up with peculiar distinctness.\nI could hear the paper boy whistling down the drive, and I heard\nsomething else.  I heard the thud of a stone, and a spit, followed by a\nlong and startled meiou from Beulah. I forgot my fear of a height, and\nadvanced boldly almost to the edge of the roof.\n\nIt was half-past six by that time, and growing dusk.\n\n\"You boy, down there!\" I called.\n\nThe paper boy turned and looked around.  Then, seeing nobody, he raised\nhis eyes.  It was a moment before he located me: when he did, he stood\nfor one moment as if paralyzed, then he gave a horrible yell, and\ndropping his papers, bolted across the lawn to the road without\nstopping to look around.  Once he fell, and his impetus was so great\nthat he turned an involuntary somersault. He was up and off again\nwithout any perceptible pause, and he leaped the hedge--which I am sure\nunder ordinary stress would have been a feat for a man.\n\nI am glad in this way to settle the Gray Lady story, which is still a\nchoice morsel in Casanova.  I believe the moral deduced by the village\nwas that it is always unlucky to throw a stone at a black cat.\n\nWith Johnny Sweeny a cloud of dust down the road, and the dinner-hour\napproaching, I hurried on with my investigations.  Luckily, the roof\nwas flat, and I was able to go over every inch of it. But the result\nwas disappointing; no trap-door revealed itself, no glass window;\nnothing but a couple of pipes two inches across, and standing perhaps\neighteen inches high and three feet apart, with a cap to prevent rain\nfrom entering and raised to permit the passage of air.  I picked up a\npebble from the roof and dropped it down, listening with my ear at one\nof the pipes. I could hear it strike on something with a sharp,\nmetallic sound, but it was impossible for me to tell how far it had\ngone.\n\nI gave up finally and went down the ladder again, getting in through\nthe ball-room window without being observed.  I went back at once to\nthe trunk-room, and, sitting down on a box, I gave my mind, as\nconsistently as I could, to the problem before me.  If the pipes in the\nroof were ventilators to the secret room, and there was no trap-door\nabove, the entrance was probably in one of the two rooms between which\nit lay--unless, indeed, the room had been built, and the opening then\nclosed with a brick and mortar wall.\n\nThe mantel fascinated me.  Made of wood and carved, the more I looked\nthe more I wondered that I had not noticed before the absurdity of such\na mantel in such a place.  It was covered with scrolls and panels, and\nfinally, by the merest accident, I pushed one of the panels to the\nside.  It moved easily, revealing a small brass knob.\n\nIt is not necessary to detail the fluctuations of hope and despair, and\nnot a little fear of what lay beyond, with which I twisted and turned\nthe knob.  It moved, but nothing seemed to happen, and then I\ndiscovered the trouble.  I pushed the knob vigorously to one side, and\nthe whole mantel swung loose from the wall almost a foot, revealing a\ncavernous space beyond.\n\nI took a long breath, closed the door from the trunk-room into the\nhall--thank Heaven, I did not lock it--and pulling the mantel-door wide\nopen, I stepped into the chimney-room.  I had time to get a hazy view\nof a small portable safe, a common wooden table and a chair--then the\nmantel door swung to, and clicked behind me.  I stood quite still for a\nmoment, in the darkness, unable to comprehend what had happened.  Then\nI turned and beat furiously at the door with my fists.  It was closed\nand locked again, and my fingers in the darkness slid over a smooth\nwooden surface without a sign of a knob.\n\nI was furiously angry--at myself, at the mantel door, at everything.  I\ndid not fear suffocation; before the thought had come to me I had\nalready seen a gleam of light from the two small ventilating pipes in\nthe roof.  They supplied air, but nothing else.  The room itself was\nshrouded in blackness.\n\nI sat down in the stiff-backed chair and tried to remember how many\ndays one could live without food and water.  When that grew monotonous\nand rather painful, I got up and, according to the time-honored rule\nfor people shut in unknown and ink-black prisons, I felt my way\naround--it was small enough, goodness knows.  I felt nothing but a\nsplintery surface of boards, and in endeavoring to get back to the\nchair, something struck me full in the face, and fell with the noise of\na thousand explosions to the ground.  When I had gathered up my nerves\nagain, I found it had been the bulb of a swinging electric light, and\nthat had it not been for the accident, I might have starved to death in\nan illuminated sepulcher.\n\nI must have dozed off.  I am sure I did not faint.  I was never more\ncomposed in my life.  I remember planning, if I were not discovered,\nwho would have my things.  I knew Liddy would want my heliotrope\npoplin, and she's a fright in lavender.  Once or twice I heard mice in\nthe partitions, and so I sat on the table, with my feet on the chair.\nI imagined I could hear the search going on through the house, and once\nsome one came into the trunk-room; I could distinctly hear footsteps.\n\n\"In the chimney!  In the chimney!\" I called with all my might, and was\nrewarded by a piercing shriek from Liddy and the slam of the trunk-room\ndoor.\n\nI felt easier after that, although the room was oppressively hot and\nenervating.  I had no doubt the search for me would now come in the\nright direction, and after a little, I dropped into a doze.  How long I\nslept I do not know.\n\nIt must have been several hours, for I had been tired from a busy day,\nand I wakened stiff from my awkward position.  I could not remember\nwhere I was for a few minutes, and my head felt heavy and congested.\nGradually I roused to my surroundings, and to the fact that in spite of\nthe ventilators, the air was bad and growing worse.  I was breathing\nlong, gasping respirations, and my face was damp and clammy.  I must\nhave been there a long time, and the searchers were probably hunting\noutside the house, dredging the creek, or beating the woodland.  I knew\nthat another hour or two would find me unconscious, and with my\ninability to cry out would go my only chance of rescue.  It was the\ncombination of bad air and heat, probably, for some inadequate\nventilation was coming through the pipes.  I tried to retain my\nconsciousness by walking the length of the room and back, over and\nover, but I had not the strength to keep it up, so I sat down on the\ntable again, my back against the wall.\n\nThe house was very still.  Once my straining ears seemed to catch a\nfootfall beneath me, possibly in my own room.  I groped for the chair\nfrom the table, and pounded with it frantically on the floor.  But\nnothing happened: I realized bitterly that if the sound was heard at\nall, no doubt it was classed with the other rappings that had so\nalarmed us recently.\n\nIt was impossible to judge the flight of time.  I measured five minutes\nby counting my pulse, allowing seventy-two beats to the minute.  But it\ntook eternities, and toward the last I found it hard to count; my head\nwas confused.\n\nAnd then--I heard sounds from below me, in the house.  There was a\npeculiar throbbing, vibrating noise that I felt rather than heard, much\nlike the pulsing beat of fire engines in the city. For one awful moment\nI thought the house was on fire, and every drop of blood in my body\ngathered around my heart; then I knew.  It was the engine of the\nautomobile, and Halsey had come back.  Hope sprang up afresh.  Halsey's\nclear head and Gertrude's intuition might do what Liddy's hysteria and\nthree detectives had failed in.\n\nAfter a time I thought I had been right.  There was certainly something\ngoing on down below; doors were slamming, people were hurrying through\nthe halls, and certain high notes of excited voices penetrated to me\nshrilly.  I hoped they were coming closer, but after a time the sounds\ndied away below, and I was left to the silence and heat, to the weight\nof the darkness, to the oppression of walls that seemed to close in on\nme and stifle me.\n\nThe first warning I had was a stealthy fumbling at the lock of the\nmantel-door.  With my mouth open to scream, I stopped. Perhaps the\nsituation had rendered me acute, perhaps it was instinctive.  Whatever\nit was, I sat without moving, and some one outside, in absolute\nstillness, ran his fingers over the carving of the mantel and--found\nthe panel.\n\nNow the sounds below redoubled: from the clatter and jarring I knew\nthat several people were running up the stairs, and as the sounds\napproached, I could even hear what they said.\n\n\"Watch the end staircases!\" Jamieson was shouting.  \"Damnation--there's\nno light here!\"  And then a second later.  \"All together now.\nOne--two--three--\"\n\nThe door into the trunk-room had been locked from the inside.  At the\nsecond that it gave, opening against the wall with a crash and\nevidently tumbling somebody into the room, the stealthy fingers beyond\nthe mantel-door gave the knob the proper impetus, and--the door swung\nopen, and closed again.  Only--and Liddy always screams and puts her\nfingers in her ears at this point--only now I was not alone in the\nchimney room.  There was some one else in the darkness, some one who\nbreathed hard, and who was so close I could have touched him with my\nhand.\n\nI was in a paralysis of terror.  Outside there were excited voices and\nincredulous oaths.  The trunks were being jerked around in a frantic\nsearch, the windows were thrown open, only to show a sheer drop of\nforty feet.  And the man in the room with me leaned against the\nmantel-door and listened.  His pursuers were plainly baffled: I heard\nhim draw a long breath, and turn to grope his way through the\nblackness.  Then--he touched my hand, cold, clammy, death-like.\n\nA hand in an empty room!  He drew in his breath, the sharp intaking of\nhorror that fills lungs suddenly collapsed.  Beyond jerking his hand\naway instantly, he made no movement.  I think absolute terror had him\nby the throat.  Then he stepped back, without turning, retreating foot\nby foot from The Dread in the corner, and I do not think he breathed.\n\nThen, with the relief of space between us, I screamed, ear-splittingly,\nmadly, and they heard me outside.\n\n\"In the chimney!\" I shrieked.  \"Behind the mantel!  The mantel!\"\n\nWith an oath the figure hurled itself across the room at me, and I\nscreamed again.  In his blind fury he had missed me; I heard him strike\nthe wall.  That one time I eluded him; I was across the room, and I had\ngot the chair.  He stood for a second, listening, then--he made another\nrush, and I struck out with my weapon.  I think it stunned him, for I\nhad a second's respite when I could hear him breathing, and some one\nshouted outside:\n\n\"We--Can't--get--in.  How--does--it--open?\"\n\nBut the man in the room had changed his tactics.  I knew he was\ncreeping on me, inch by inch, and I could not tell from where. And\nthen--he caught me.  He held his hand over my mouth, and I bit him.  I\nwas helpless, strangling,--and some one was trying to break in the\nmantel from outside.  It began to yield somewhere, for a thin wedge of\nyellowish light was reflected on the opposite wall.  When he saw that,\nmy assailant dropped me with a curse; then--the opposite wall swung\nopen noiselessly, closed again without a sound, and I was alone.  The\nintruder was gone.\n\n\"In the next room!\" I called wildly.  \"The next room!\"  But the sound\nof blows on the mantel drowned my voice.  By the time I had made them\nunderstand, a couple of minutes had elapsed.  The pursuit was taken up\nthen, by all except Alex, who was determined to liberate me.  When I\nstepped out into the trunk-room, a free woman again, I could hear the\nchase far below.\n\nI must say, for all Alex's anxiety to set me free, he paid little\nenough attention to my plight.  He jumped through the opening into the\nsecret room, and picked up the portable safe.\n\n\"I am going to put this in Mr. Halsey's room, Miss Innes,\" he said,\n\"and I shall send one of the detectives to guard it.\"\n\nI hardly heard him.  I wanted to laugh and cry in the same breath--to\ncrawl into bed and have a cup of tea, and scold Liddy, and do any of\nthe thousand natural things that I had never expected to do again.  And\nthe air!  The touch of the cool night air on my face!\n\nAs Alex and I reached the second floor, Mr. Jamieson met us.  He was\ngrave and quiet, and he nodded comprehendingly when he saw the safe.\n\n\"Will you come with me for a moment, Miss Innes?\" he asked soberly, and\non my assenting, he led the way to the east wing. There were lights\nmoving around below, and some of the maids were standing gaping down.\nThey screamed when they saw me, and drew back to let me pass.  There\nwas a sort of hush over the scene; Alex, behind me, muttered something\nI could not hear, and brushed past me without ceremony.  Then I\nrealized that a man was lying doubled up at the foot of the staircase,\nand that Alex was stooping over him.\n\nAs I came slowly down, Winters stepped back, and Alex straightened\nhimself, looking at me across the body with impenetrable eyes.  In his\nhand he held a shaggy gray wig, and before me on the floor lay the man\nwhose headstone stood in Casanova churchyard--Paul Armstrong.\n\nWinters told the story in a dozen words.  In his headlong flight down\nthe circular staircase, with Winters just behind, Paul Armstrong had\npitched forward violently, struck his head against the door to the east\nveranda, and probably broken his neck.  He had died as Winters reached\nhim.\n\nAs the detective finished, I saw Halsey, pale and shaken, in the\ncard-room doorway, and for the first time that night I lost my\nself-control.  I put my arms around my boy, and for a moment he had to\nsupport me.  A second later, over Halsey's shoulder, I saw something\nthat turned my emotion into other channels, for, behind him, in the\nshadowy card-room, were Gertrude and Alex, the gardener, and--there is\nno use mincing matters--he was kissing her!\n\nI was unable to speak.  Twice I opened my mouth: then I turned Halsey\naround and pointed.  They were quite unconscious of us; her head was on\nhis shoulder, his face against her hair.  As it happened, it was Mr.\nJamieson who broke up the tableau.\n\nHe stepped over to Alex and touched him on the arm.\n\n\"And now,\" he said quietly, \"how long are you and I to play OUR little\ncomedy, Mr. Bailey?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nTHE ODDS AND ENDS\n\nOf Doctor Walker's sensational escape that night to South America, of\nthe recovery of over a million dollars in cash and securities in the\nsafe from the chimney room--the papers have kept the public well\ninformed.  Of my share in discovering the secret chamber they have been\nsingularly silent.  The inner history has never been told.  Mr.\nJamieson got all kinds of credit, and some of it he deserved, but if\nJack Bailey, as Alex, had not traced Halsey and insisted on the\ndisinterring of Paul Armstrong's casket, if he had not suspected the\ntruth from the start, where would the detective have been?\n\nWhen Halsey learned the truth, he insisted on going the next morning,\nweak as he was, to Louise, and by night she was at Sunnyside, under\nGertrude's particular care, while her mother had gone to Barbara\nFitzhugh's.\n\nWhat Halsey said to Mrs. Armstrong I never knew, but that he was\nconsiderate and chivalrous I feel confident.  It was Halsey's way\nalways with women.\n\nHe and Louise had no conversation together until that night. Gertrude\nand Alex--I mean Jack--had gone for a walk, although it was nine\no'clock, and anybody but a pair of young geese would have known that\ndew was falling, and that it is next to impossible to get rid of a\nsummer cold.\n\nAt half after nine, growing weary of my own company, I went downstairs\nto find the young people.  At the door of the living-room I paused.\nGertrude and Jack had returned and were there, sitting together on a\ndivan, with only one lamp lighted.  They did not see or hear me, and I\nbeat a hasty retreat to the library.  But here again I was driven back.\nLouise was sitting in a deep chair, looking the happiest I had ever\nseen her, with Halsey on the arm of the chair, holding her close.\n\nIt was no place for an elderly spinster.  I retired to my upstairs\nsitting-room and got out Eliza Klinefelter's lavender slippers.  Ah,\nwell, the foster motherhood would soon have to be put away in camphor\nagain.\n\nThe next day, by degrees, I got the whole story.\n\nPaul Armstrong had a besetting evil--the love of money.  Common enough,\nbut he loved money, not for what it would buy, but for its own sake.\nAn examination of the books showed no irregularities in the past year\nsince John had been cashier, but before that, in the time of Anderson,\nthe old cashier, who had died, much strange juggling had been done with\nthe records.  The railroad in New Mexico had apparently drained the\nbanker's private fortune, and he determined to retrieve it by one\nstroke. This was nothing less than the looting of the bank's\nsecurities, turning them into money, and making his escape.\n\nBut the law has long arms.  Paul Armstrong evidently studied the\nsituation carefully.  Just as the only good Indian is a dead Indian, so\nthe only safe defaulter is a dead defaulter.  He decided to die, to all\nappearances, and when the hue and cry subsided, he would be able to\nenjoy his money almost anywhere he wished.\n\nThe first necessity was an accomplice.  The connivance of Doctor Walker\nwas suggested by his love for Louise.  The man was unscrupulous, and\nwith the girl as a bait, Paul Armstrong soon had him fast.  The plan\nwas apparently the acme of simplicity: a small town in the west, an\nattack of heart disease, a body from a medical college dissecting-room\nshipped in a trunk to Doctor Walker by a colleague in San Francisco,\nand palmed off for the supposed dead banker.  What was simpler?\n\nThe woman, Nina Carrington, was the cog that slipped.  What she only\nsuspected, what she really knew, we never learned.  She was a\nchambermaid in the hotel at C--, and it was evidently her intention to\nblackmail Doctor Walker.  His position at that time was uncomfortable:\nto pay the woman to keep quiet would be confession.  He denied the\nwhole thing, and she went to Halsey.\n\nIt was this that had taken Halsey to the doctor the night he\ndisappeared.  He accused the doctor of the deception, and, crossing the\nlawn, had said something cruel to Louise.  Then, furious at her\napparent connivance, he had started for the station.  Doctor Walker and\nPaul Armstrong--the latter still lame where I had shot him--hurried\nacross to the embankment, certain only of one thing.  Halsey must not\ntell the detective what he suspected until the money had been removed\nfrom the chimney-room. They stepped into the road in front of the car\nto stop it, and fate played into their hands.  The car struck the\ntrain, and they had only to dispose of the unconscious figure in the\nroad.  This they did as I have told.  For three days Halsey lay in the\nbox car, tied hand and foot, suffering tortures of thirst, delirious at\ntimes, and discovered by a tramp at Johnsville only in time to save his\nlife.\n\nTo go back to Paul Armstrong.  At the last moment his plans had been\nfrustrated.  Sunnyside, with its hoard in the chimney-room, had been\nrented without his knowledge!  Attempts to dislodge me having failed,\nhe was driven to breaking into his own house.  The ladder in the chute,\nthe burning of the stable and the entrance through the card-room\nwindow--all were in the course of a desperate attempt to get into the\nchimney-room.\n\nLouise and her mother had, from the first, been the great\nstumbling-blocks.  The plan had been to send Louise away until it was\ntoo late for her to interfere, but she came back to the hotel at C--\njust at the wrong time.  There was a terrible scene.  The girl was told\nthat something of the kind was necessary, that the bank was about to\nclose and her stepfather would either avoid arrest and disgrace in this\nway, or kill himself.  Fanny Armstrong was a weakling, but Louise was\nmore difficult to manage.  She had no love for her stepfather, but her\ndevotion to her mother was entire, self-sacrificing.  Forced into\nacquiescence by her mother's appeals, overwhelmed by the situation, the\ngirl consented and fled.\n\nFrom somewhere in Colorado she sent an anonymous telegram to Jack\nBailey at the Traders' Bank.  Trapped as she was, she did not want to\nsee an innocent man arrested.  The telegram, received on Thursday, had\nsent the cashier to the bank that night in a frenzy.\n\nLouise arrived at Sunnyside and found the house rented.  Not knowing\nwhat to do, she sent for Arnold at the Greenwood Club, and told him a\nlittle, not all.  She told him that there was something wrong, and that\nthe bank was about to close.  That his father was responsible.  Of the\nconspiracy she said nothing.  To her surprise, Arnold already knew,\nthrough Bailey that night, that things were not right.  Moreover, he\nsuspected what Louise did not, that the money was hidden at Sunnyside.\nHe had a scrap of paper that indicated a concealed room somewhere.\n\nHis inherited cupidity was aroused.  Eager to get Halsey and Jack\nBailey out of the house, he went up to the east entry, and in the\nbilliard-room gave the cashier what he had refused earlier in the\nevening--the address of Paul Armstrong in California and a telegram\nwhich had been forwarded to the club for Bailey, from Doctor Walker.\nIt was in response to one Bailey had sent, and it said that Paul\nArmstrong was very ill.\n\nBailey was almost desperate.  He decided to go west and find Paul\nArmstrong, and to force him to disgorge.  But the catastrophe at the\nbank occurred sooner than he had expected.  On the moment of starting\nwest, at Andrews Station, where Mr. Jamieson had located the car, he\nread that the bank had closed, and, going back, surrendered himself.\n\nJohn Bailey had known Paul Armstrong intimately.  He did not believe\nthat the money was gone; in fact, it was hardly possible in the\ninterval since the securities had been taken.  Where was it?  And from\nsome chance remark let fall some months earlier by Arnold Armstrong at\na dinner, Bailey felt sure there was a hidden room at Sunnyside.  He\ntried to see the architect of the building, but, like the contractor,\nif he knew of the such a room he refused any information.  It was\nHalsey's idea that John Bailey come to the house as a gardener, and\npursue his investigations as he could.  His smooth upper lip had been\nsufficient disguise, with his change of clothes, and a hair-cut by a\ncountry barber.\n\nSo it was Alex, Jack Bailey, who had been our ghost.  Not only had he\nalarmed--Louise and himself, he admitted--on the circular staircase,\nbut he had dug the hole in the trunk-room wall, and later sent Eliza\ninto hysteria.  The note Liddy had found in Gertrude's scrap-basket was\nfrom him, and it was he who had startled me into unconsciousness by the\nclothes chute, and, with Gertrude's help, had carried me to Louise's\nroom.  Gertrude, I learned, had watched all night beside me, in an\nextremity of anxiety about me.\n\nThat old Thomas had seen his master, and thought he had seen the\nSunnyside ghost, there could be no doubt.  Of that story of Thomas',\nabout seeing Jack Bailey in the footpath between the club and\nSunnyside, the night Liddy and I heard the noise on the circular\nstaircase--that, too, was right.  On the night before Arnold Armstrong\nwas murdered, Jack Bailey had made his first attempt to search for the\nsecret room. He secured Arnold's keys from his room at the club and got\ninto the house, armed with a golf-stick for sounding the walls.  He ran\nagainst the hamper at the head of the stairs, caught his cuff-link in\nit, and dropped the golf-stick with a crash.  He was glad enough to get\naway without an alarm being raised, and he took the \"owl\" train to town.\n\nThe oddest thing to me was that Mr. Jamieson had known for some time\nthat Alex was Jack Bailey.  But the face of the pseudo-gardener was\nvery queer indeed, when that night, in the card-room, the detective\nturned to him and said:\n\n\"How long are you and I going to play our little comedy, MR. BAILEY?\"\n\nWell, it is all over now.  Paul Armstrong rests in Casanova churchyard,\nand this time there is no mistake.  I went to the funeral, because I\nwanted to be sure he was really buried, and I looked at the step of the\nshaft where I had sat that night, and wondered if it was all real.\nSunnyside is for sale--no, I shall not buy it.  Little Lucien Armstrong\nis living with his step-grandmother, and she is recovering gradually\nfrom troubles that had extended over the entire period of her second\nmarriage. Anne Watson lies not far from the man she killed, and who as\nsurely caused her death.  Thomas, the fourth victim of the conspiracy,\nis buried on the hill.  With Nina Carrington, five lives were\nsacrificed in the course of this grim conspiracy.\n\nThere will be two weddings before long, and Liddy has asked for my\nheliotrope poplin to wear to the church.  I knew she would. She has\nwanted it for three years, and she was quite ugly the time I spilled\ncoffee on it.  We are very quiet, just the two of us.  Liddy still\nclings to her ghost theory, and points to my wet and muddy boots in the\ntrunk-room as proof.  I am gray, I admit, but I haven't felt as well in\na dozen years.  Sometimes, when I am bored, I ring for Liddy, and we\ntalk things over.  When Warner married Rosie, Liddy sniffed and said\nwhat I took for faithfulness in Rosie had been nothing but mawkishness.\nI have not yet outlived Liddy's contempt because I gave them silver\nknives and forks as a wedding gift.\n\nSo we sit and talk, and sometimes Liddy threatens to leave, and often I\ndischarge her, but we stay together somehow.  I am talking of renting a\nhouse next year, and Liddy says to be sure there is no ghost.  To be\nperfectly frank, I never really lived until that summer.  Time has\npassed since I began this story. My neighbors are packing up for\nanother summer.  Liddy is having the awnings put up, and the window\nboxes filled.  Liddy or no Liddy, I shall advertise to-morrow for a\nhouse in the country, and I don't care if it has a Circular Staircase.",
