THE BLIGHT IN THE HILLS\n\nHigh noon of a crisp October day, sunshine flooding the earth with\nthe warmth and light of old wine and, going single-file up through\nthe jagged gap that the dripping of water has worn down through the\nCumberland Mountains from crest to valley-level, a gray horse and two\nbig mules, a man and two young girls. On the gray horse, I led the\ntortuous way. After me came my small sister--and after her and like\nher, mule-back, rode the Blight--dressed as she would be for a gallop in\nCentral Park or to ride a hunter in a horse show.\n\nI was taking them, according to promise, where the feet of other women\nthan mountaineers had never trod--beyond the crest of the Big Black--to\nthe waters of the Cumberland--the lair of moonshiner and feudsman, where\nis yet pocketed a civilization that, elsewhere, is long ago gone. This\nhad been a pet dream of the Blight's for a long time, and now the dream\nwas coming true. The Blight was in the hills.\n\n\nNobody ever went to her mother's house without asking to see her even\nwhen she was a little thing with black hair, merry face and black eyes.\nBoth men and women, with children of their own, have told me that she\nwas, perhaps, the most fascinating child that ever lived. There be some\nwho claim that she has never changed--and I am among them. She began\nearly, regardless of age, sex or previous condition of servitude--she\ncontinues recklessly as she began--and none makes complaint. Thus was\nit in her own world--thus it was when she came to mine. On the way\ndown from the North, the conductor's voice changed from a command to\na request when he asked for her ticket. The jacketed lord of the\ndining-car saw her from afar and advanced to show her to a seat--that\nshe might ride forward, sit next to a shaded window and be free from the\nglare of the sun on the other side. Two porters made a rush for her bag\nwhen she got off the car, and the proprietor of the little hotel in the\nlittle town where we had to wait several hours for the train into the\nmountains gave her the bridal chamber for an afternoon nap. From this\nlittle town to “The Gap” is the worst sixty-mile ride, perhaps, in the\nworld. She sat in a dirty day-coach; the smoke rolled in at the windows\nand doors; the cars shook and swayed and lumbered around curves and\ndown and up gorges; there were about her rough men, crying children,\nslatternly women, tobacco juice, peanuts, popcorn and apple cores, but\ndainty, serene and as merry as ever, she sat through that ride with a\nradiant smile, her keen black eyes noting everything unlovely within and\nthe glory of hill, tree and chasm without. Next morning at home, where\nwe rise early, no one was allowed to waken her and she had breakfast in\nbed--for the Blight's gentle tyranny was established on sight and varied\nnot at the Gap.\n\nWhen she went down the street that day everybody stared surreptitiously\nand with perfect respect, as her dainty black plumed figure passed; the\npost-office clerk could barely bring himself to say that there was no\nletter for her. The soda-fountain boy nearly filled her glass with syrup\nbefore he saw that he was not strictly minding his own business; the\nclerk, when I bought chocolate for her, unblushingly added extra weight\nand, as we went back, she met them both--Marston, the young engineer\nfrom the North, crossing the street and, at the same moment, a drunken\nyoung tough with an infuriated face reeling in a run around the corner\nahead of us as though he were being pursued. Now we have a volunteer\npolice guard some forty strong at the Gap--and from habit, I started\nfor him, but the Blight caught my arm tight. The young engineer in three\nstrides had reached the curb-stone and all he sternly said was:\n\n“Here! Here!”\n\nThe drunken youth wheeled and his right hand shot toward his hip pocket.\nThe engineer was belted with a pistol, but with one lightning movement\nand an incredibly long reach, his right fist caught the fellow's jaw\nso that he pitched backward and collapsed like an empty bag. Then the\nengineer caught sight of the Blight's bewildered face, flushed, gripped\nhis hands in front of him and simply stared. At last he saw me:\n\n“Oh,” he said, “how do you do?” and he turned to his prisoner, but the\npanting sergeant and another policeman--also a volunteer--were already\nlifting him to his feet. I introduced the boy and the Blight then, and\nfor the first time in my life I saw the Blight--shaken. Round-eyed, she\nmerely gazed at him.\n\n“That was pretty well done,” I said.\n\n“Oh, he was drunk and I knew he would be slow.” Now something curious\nhappened. The dazed prisoner was on his feet, and his captors were\nstarting with him to the calaboose when he seemed suddenly to come to\nhis senses.\n\n“Jes wait a minute, will ye?” he said quietly, and his captors, thinking\nperhaps that he wanted to say something to me, stopped. The mountain\nyouth turned a strangely sobered face and fixed his blue eyes on the\nengineer as though he were searing every feature of that imperturbable\nyoung man in his brain forever. It was not a bad face, but the avenging\nhatred in it was fearful. Then he, too, saw the Blight, his face calmed\nmagically and he, too, stared at her, and turned away with an oath\nchecked at his lips. We went on--the Blight thrilled, for she had heard\nmuch of our volunteer force at the Gap and had seen something already.\nPresently I looked back. Prisoner and captors were climbing the little\nhill toward the calaboose and the mountain boy just then turned his head\nand I could swear that his eyes sought not the engineer, whom we left\nat the corner, but, like the engineer, he was looking at the Blight.\nWhereat I did not wonder--particularly as to the engineer. He had been\nin the mountains for a long time and I knew what this vision from home\nmeant to him. He turned up at the house quite early that night.\n\n“I'm not on duty until eleven,” he said hesitantly, “and I thought\nI'd----”\n\n“Come right in.”\n\nI asked him a few questions about business and then I left him and the\nBlight alone. When I came back she had a Gatling gun of eager questions\nranged on him and--happy withal--he was squirming no little. I followed\nhim to the gate.\n\n“Are you really going over into those God-forsaken mountains?” he asked.\n\n“I thought I would.”\n\n“And you are going to take HER?”\n\n“And my sister.”\n\n“Oh, I beg your pardon.” He strode away.\n\n“Coming up by the mines?” he called back.\n\n“Perhaps will you show us around?”\n\n“I guess I will,” he said emphatically, and he went on to risk his neck\non a ten-mile ride along a mountain road in the dark.\n\n“I LIKE a man,” said the Blight. “I like a MAN.”\n\nOf course the Blight must see everything, so she insisted on going to\nthe police court next morning for the trial of the mountain boy. The boy\nwas in the witness chair when we got there, and the Hon. Samuel Budd was\nhis counsel. He had volunteered to defend the prisoner, I was soon told,\nand then I understood. The November election was not far off and the\nHon. Samuel Budd was candidate for legislature. More even, the boy's\nfather was a warm supporter of Mr. Budd and the boy himself might\nperhaps render good service in the cause when the time came--as indeed\nhe did. On one of the front chairs sat the young engineer and it was a\nquestion whether he or the prisoner saw the Blight's black plumes first.\nThe eyes of both flashed toward her simultaneously, the engineer colored\nperceptibly and the mountain boy stopped short in speech and his pallid\nface flushed with unmistakable shame. Then he went on: “He had liquered\nup,” he said, “and had got tight afore he knowed it and he didn't mean\nno harm and had never been arrested afore in his whole life.”\n\n“Have you ever been drunk before?” asked the prosecuting attorney\nseverely. The lad looked surprised.\n\n“Co'se I have, but I ain't goin' to agin--leastwise not in this here\ntown.” There was a general laugh at this and the aged mayor rapped\nloudly.\n\n“That will do,” said the attorney.\n\nThe lad stepped down, hitched his chair slightly so that his back was\nto the Blight, sank down in it until his head rested on the back of the\nchair and crossed his legs. The Hon. Samuel Budd arose and the Blight\nlooked at him with wonder. His long yellow hair was parted in the middle\nand brushed with plaster-like precision behind two enormous ears, he\nwore spectacles, gold-rimmed and with great staring lenses, and his face\nwas smooth and ageless. He caressed his chin ruminatingly and rolled\nhis lips until they settled into a fine resultant of wisdom, patience,\ntoleration and firmness. His manner was profound and his voice oily and\nsoothing.\n\n“May it please your Honor--my young friend frankly pleads guilty.” He\npaused as though the majesty of the law could ask no more. “He is\na young man of naturally high and somewhat--naturally, too, no\ndoubt--bibulous spirits. Homoepathically--if inversely--the result was\nlogical. In the untrammelled life of the liberty-breathing mountains,\nwhere the stern spirit of law and order, of which your Honor is the\naugust symbol, does not prevail as it does here--thanks to your Honor's\nwise and just dispensations--the lad has, I may say, naturally acquired\na certain recklessness of mood--indulgence which, however easily\ncondoned there, must here be sternly rebuked. At the same time, he knew\nnot the conditions here, he became exhilarated without malice, prepensey\nor even, I may say, consciousness. He would not have done as he has,\nif he had known what he knows now, and, knowing, he will not repeat the\noffence. I need say no more. I plead simply that your Honor will temper\nthe justice that is only yours with the mercy that is yours--only.”\n\nHis Honor was visibly affected and to cover it--his methods being\ninformal--he said with sharp irrelevancy:\n\n“Who bailed this young feller out last night?” The sergeant spoke:\n\n“Why, Mr. Marston thar”--with outstretched finger toward the young\nengineer. The Blight's black eyes leaped with exultant appreciation and\nthe engineer turned crimson. His Honor rolled his quid around in his\nmouth once, and peered over his glasses:\n\n“I fine this young feller two dollars and costs.” The young fellow had\nturned slowly in his chair and his blue eyes blazed at the engineer with\nunappeasable hatred. I doubt if he had heard his Honor's voice.\n\n“I want ye to know that I'm obleeged to ye an' I ain't a-goin' to fergit\nit; but if I'd a known hit was you I'd a stayed in jail an' seen you in\nhell afore I'd a been bounden to ye.”\n\n“Ten dollars fer contempt of couht.” The boy was hot now.\n\n“Oh, fine and be--” The Hon. Samuel Budd had him by the shoulder, the\nboy swallowed his voice and his starting tears of rage, and after a\nwhisper to his Honor, the Hon. Samuel led him out. Outside, the engineer\nlaughed to the Blight:\n\n“Pretty peppery, isn't he?” but the Blight said nothing, and later we\nsaw the youth on a gray horse crossing the bridge and conducted by the\nHon. Samuel Budd, who stopped and waved him toward the mountains. The\nboy went on and across the plateau, the gray Gap swallowed him. That\nnight, at the post-office, the Hon. Sam plucked me aside by the sleeve.\n\n“I know Marston is agin me in this race--but I'll do him a good turn\njust the same. You tell him to watch out for that young fellow. He's all\nright when he's sober, but when he's drunk--well, over in Kentucky, they\ncall him the Wild Dog.”\n\n\nSeveral days later we started out through that same Gap. The glum\nstableman looked at the Blight's girths three times, and with my own\neyes starting and my heart in my mouth, I saw her pass behind her\nsixteen-hand-high mule and give him a friendly tap on the rump as she\nwent by. The beast gave an appreciative flop of one ear and that\nwas all. Had I done that, any further benefit to me or mine would be\nincorporated in the terms of an insurance policy. So, stating this, I\nbelieve I state the limit and can now go on to say at last that it was\nbecause she seemed to be loved by man and brute alike that a big man of\nher own town, whose body, big as it was, was yet too small for his heart\nand from whose brain things went off at queer angles, always christened\nher perversely as--“The Blight.”\n\n\n\n\nII. ON THE WILD DOG'S TRAIL\n\nSo up we went past Bee Rock, Preacher's Creek and Little Looney, past\nthe mines where high on a “tipple” stood the young engineer looking down\nat us, and looking after the Blight as we passed on into a dim rocky\navenue walled on each side with rhododendrons. I waved at him and shook\nmy head--we would see him coming back. Beyond a deserted log-cabin we\nturned up a spur of the mountain. Around a clump of bushes we came on\na gray-bearded mountaineer holding his horse by the bridle and from a\ncovert high above two more men appeared with Winchesters. The Blight\nbreathed forth an awed whisper:\n\n“Are they moonshiners?”\n\nI nodded sagely, “Most likely,” and the Blight was thrilled. They might\nhave been squirrel-hunters most innocent, but the Blight had heard much\ntalk of moonshine stills and mountain feuds and the men who run them\nand I took the risk of denying her nothing. Up and up we went, those\ntwo mules swaying from side to side with a motion little short of\nelephantine and, by and by, the Blight called out:\n\n“You ride ahead and don't you DARE look back.”\n\nAccustomed to obeying the Blight's orders, I rode ahead with eyes to\nthe front. Presently, a shriek made me turn suddenly. It was nothing--my\nlittle sister's mule had gone near a steep cliff--perilously near, as\nits rider thought, but I saw why I must not look back; those two little\ngirls were riding astride on side-saddles, the booted little right foot\nof each dangling stirrupless--a posture quite decorous but ludicrous.\n\n“Let us know if anybody comes,” they cried. A mountaineer descended into\nsight around a loop of the path above.\n\n“Change cars,” I shouted.\n\nThey changed and, passing, were grave, demure--then they changed again,\nand thus we climbed.\n\nSuch a glory as was below, around and above us; the air like champagne;\nthe sunlight rich and pouring like a flood on the gold that the beeches\nhad strewn in the path, on the gold that the poplars still shook high\nabove and shimmering on the royal scarlet of the maple and the sombre\nrusset of the oak. From far below us to far above us a deep curving\nravine was slashed into the mountain side as by one stroke of a gigantic\nscimitar. The darkness deep down was lighted up with cool green,\ninterfused with liquid gold. Russet and yellow splashed the mountain\nsides beyond and high up the maples were in a shaking blaze. The\nBlight's swift eyes took all in and with indrawn breath she drank it all\ndeep down.\n\nAn hour by sun we were near the top, which was bared of trees and\nturned into rich farm-land covered with blue-grass. Along these upland\npastures, dotted with grazing cattle, and across them we rode toward the\nmountain wildernesses on the other side, down into which a zigzag path\nwriggles along the steep front of Benham's spur. At the edge of the\nsteep was a cabin and a bushy-bearded mountaineer, who looked like\na brigand, answered my hail. He “mought” keep us all night, but he'd\n“ruther not, as we could git a place to stay down the spur.” Could we\nget down before dark? The mountaineer lifted his eyes to where the sun\nwas breaking the horizon of the west into streaks and splashes of yellow\nand crimson.\n\n“Oh, yes, you can git thar afore dark.”\n\nNow I knew that the mountaineer's idea of distance is vague--but he\nknows how long it takes to get from one place to another. So we started\ndown--dropping at once into thick dark woods, and as we went looping\ndown, the deeper was the gloom. That sun had suddenly severed all\nconnection with the laws of gravity and sunk, and it was all the darker\nbecause the stars were not out. The path was steep and coiled downward\nlike a wounded snake. In one place a tree had fallen across it, and to\nreach the next coil of the path below was dangerous. So I had the\ngirls dismount and I led the gray horse down on his haunches. The mules\nrefused to follow, which was rather unusual. I went back and from a safe\ndistance in the rear I belabored them down. They cared neither for gray\nhorse nor crooked path, but turned of their own devilish wills along the\nbushy mountain side. As I ran after them the gray horse started calmly\non down and those two girls shrieked with laughter--they knew no better.\nFirst one way and then the other down the mountain went those mules,\nwith me after them, through thick bushes, over logs, stumps and bowlders\nand holes--crossing the path a dozen times. What that path was there for\nnever occurred to those long-eared half asses, whole fools, and by and\nby, when the girls tried to shoo them down they clambered around and\nabove them and struck the path back up the mountain. The horse had\ngone down one way, the mules up the other, and there was no health in\nanything. The girls could not go up--so there was nothing to do but go\ndown, which, hard as it was, was easier than going up. The path was not\nvisible now. Once in a while I would stumble from it and crash through\nthe bushes to the next coil below. Finally I went down, sliding one foot\nahead all the time--knowing that when leaves rustled under that foot I\nwas on the point of going astray. Sometimes I had to light a match to\nmake sure of the way, and thus the ridiculous descent was made with\nthose girls in high spirits behind. Indeed, the darker, rockier, steeper\nit got, the more they shrieked from pure joy--but I was anything than\nhappy. It was dangerous. I didn't know the cliffs and high rocks we\nmight skirt and an unlucky guidance might land us in the creek-bed far\ndown. But the blessed stars came out, the moon peered over a farther\nmountain and on the last spur there was the gray horse browsing in the\npath--and the sound of running water not far below. Fortunately on the\ngray horse were the saddle-bags of the chattering infants who thought\nthe whole thing a mighty lark. We reached the running water, struck a\nflock of geese and knew, in consequence, that humanity was somewhere\nnear. A few turns of the creek and a beacon light shone below. The pales\nof a picket fence, the cheering outlines of a log-cabin came in view and\nat a peaked gate I shouted:\n\n“Hello!”\n\nYou enter no mountaineer's yard without that announcing cry. It was\nmediaeval, the Blight said, positively--two lorn damsels, a benighted\nknight partially stripped of his armor by bush and sharp-edged rock,\na gray palfrey (she didn't mention the impatient asses that had turned\nhomeward) and she wished I had a horn to wind. I wanted a “horn” badly\nenough--but it was not the kind men wind. By and by we got a response:\n\n“Hello!” was the answer, as an opened door let out into the yard a broad\nband of light. Could we stay all night? The voice replied that the owner\nwould see “Pap.” “Pap” seemed willing, and the boy opened the gate\nand into the house went the Blight and the little sister. Shortly, I\nfollowed.\n\nThere, all in one room, lighted by a huge wood-fire, rafters above,\npuncheon floor beneath--cane-bottomed chairs and two beds the only\nfurniture-“pap,” barefooted, the old mother in the chimney-corner with\na pipe, strings of red pepper-pods, beans and herbs hanging around\nand above, a married daughter with a child at her breast, two or three\nchildren with yellow hair and bare feet all looking with all their eyes\nat the two visitors who had dropped upon them from another world. The\nBlight's eyes were brighter than usual--that was the only sign she gave\nthat she was not in her own drawing-room. Apparently she saw nothing\nstrange or unusual even, but there was really nothing that she did not\nsee or hear and absorb, as few others than the Blight can.\n\nStraightway, the old woman knocked the ashes out of her pipe.\n\n“I reckon you hain't had nothin' to eat,” she said and disappeared. The\nold man asked questions, the young mother rocked her baby on her knees,\nthe children got less shy and drew near the fireplace, the Blight and\nthe little sister exchanged a furtive smile and the contrast of the\nextremes in American civilization, as shown in that little cabin,\ninterested me mightily.\n\n“Yer snack's ready,” said the old woman. The old man carried the chairs\ninto the kitchen, and when I followed the girls were seated. The chairs\nwere so low that their chins came barely over their plates, and demure\nand serious as they were they surely looked most comical. There was the\nusual bacon and corn-bread and potatoes and sour milk, and the two girls\nstruggled with the rude fare nobly.\n\nAfter supper I joined the old man and the old woman with a\npipe--exchanging my tobacco for their long green with more satisfaction\nprobably to me than to them, for the long green was good, and strong and\nfragrant.\n\nThe old woman asked the Blight and the little sister many questions and\nthey, in turn, showed great interest in the baby in arms, whereat the\neighteen-year-old mother blushed and looked greatly pleased.\n\n“You got mighty purty black eyes,” said the old woman to the Blight,\nand not to slight the little sister she added, “An' you got mighty purty\nteeth.”\n\nThe Blight showed hers in a radiant smile and the old woman turned back\nto her.\n\n“Oh, you've got both,” she said and she shook her head, as though she\nwere thinking of the damage they had done. It was my time now--to ask\nquestions.\n\nThey didn't have many amusements on that creek, I discovered--and\nno dances. Sometimes the boys went coon-hunting and there were\ncorn-shuckings, house-raisings and quilting-parties.\n\n“Does anybody round here play the banjo?”\n\n“None o' my boys,” said the old woman, “but Tom Green's son down the\ncreek--he follers pickin' the banjo a leetle.” “Follows pickin' “--the\nBlight did not miss that phrase.\n\n“What do you foller fer a livin'?” the old man asked me suddenly.\n\n“I write for a living.” He thought a while.\n\n“Well, it must be purty fine to have a good handwrite.” This nearly\ndissolved the Blight and the little sister, but they held on heroically.\n\n“Is there much fighting around here?” I asked presently.\n\n“Not much 'cept when one young feller up the river gets to tearin' up\nthings. I heerd as how he was over to the Gap last week--raisin'\nhell. He comes by here on his way home.” The Blight's eyes opened\nwide--apparently we were on his trail. It is not wise for a member of\nthe police guard at the Gap to show too much curiosity about the lawless\nones of the hills, and I asked no questions.\n\n“They calls him the Wild Dog over here,” he added, and then he yawned\ncavernously.\n\nI looked around with divining eye for the sleeping arrangements soon to\ncome, which sometimes are embarrassing to “furriners” who are unable to\ngrasp at once the primitive unconsciousness of the mountaineers and, in\nconsequence, accept a point of view natural to them because enforced by\narchitectural limitations and a hospitality that turns no one seeking\nshelter from any door. They were, however, better prepared than I had\nhoped for. They had a spare room on the porch and just outside the door,\nand when the old woman led the two girls to it, I followed with their\nsaddle-bags. The room was about seven feet by six and was windowless.\n\n“You'd better leave your door open a little,” I said, “or you'll smother\nin there.”\n\n“Well,” said the old woman, “hit's all right to leave the door open.\nNothin's goin' ter bother ye, but one o' my sons is out a coon-huntin'\nand he mought come in, not knowin' you're thar. But you jes' holler an'\nhe'll move on.” She meant precisely what she said and saw no humor at\nall in such a possibility--but when the door closed, I could hear those\ngirls stifling shrieks of laughter.\n\nLiterally, that night, I was a member of the family. I had a bed to\nmyself (the following night I was not so fortunate)--in one corner;\nbehind the head of mine the old woman, the daughter-in-law and the\nbaby had another in the other corner, and the old man with the two boys\nspread a pallet on the floor. That is the invariable rule of courtesy\nwith the mountaineer, to give his bed to the stranger and take to\nthe floor himself, and, in passing, let me say that never, in a\nlong experience, have I seen the slightest consciousness--much less\nimmodesty--in a mountain cabin in my life. The same attitude on the\npart of the visitors is taken for granted--any other indeed holds mortal\npossibilities of offence--so that if the visitor has common sense, all\nembarrassment passes at once. The door was closed, the fire blazed on\nuncovered, the smothered talk and laughter of the two girls ceased, the\ncoon-hunter came not and the night passed in peace.\n\nIt must have been near daybreak that I was aroused by the old man\nleaving the cabin and I heard voices and the sound of horses' feet\noutside. When he came back he was grinning.\n\n“Hit's your mules.”\n\n“Who found them?”\n\n“The Wild Dog had 'em,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nIII. THE AURICULAR TALENT OF THE HON. SAMUEL BUDD\n\nBehind us came the Hon. Samuel Budd. Just when the sun was slitting the\neast with a long streak of fire, the Hon. Samuel was, with the jocund\nday, standing tiptoe in his stirrups on the misty mountain top and\npeering into the ravine down which we had slid the night before, and he\ngrumbled no little when he saw that he, too, must get off his horse\nand slide down. The Hon. Samuel was ambitious, Southern, and a lawyer.\nWithout saying, it goes that he was also a politician. He was not a\nnative of the mountains, but he had cast his fortunes in the highlands,\nand he was taking the first step that he hoped would, before many\nyears, land him in the National Capitol. He really knew little about the\nmountaineers, even now, and he had never been among his constituents on\nDevil's Fork, where he was bound now. The campaign had so far been full\nof humor and full of trials--not the least of which sprang from the fact\nthat it was sorghum time. Everybody through the mountains was making\nsorghum, and every mountain child was eating molasses.\n\nNow, as the world knows, the straightest way to the heart of the honest\nvoter is through the women of the land, and the straightest way to the\nheart of the women is through the children of the land; and one method\nof winning both, with rural politicians, is to kiss the babies wide and\nfar. So as each infant, at sorghum time, has a circle of green-brown\nstickiness about his chubby lips, and as the Hon. Sam was averse to\n“long sweetenin'” even in his coffee, this particular political device\njust now was no small trial to the Hon. Samuel Budd. But in the language\nof one of his firmest supporters Uncle Tommie Hendricks:\n\n“The Hon. Sam done his duty, and he done it damn well.”\n\nThe issue at stake was the site of the new Court-House--two localities\nclaiming the right undisputed, because they were the only two places\nin the county where there was enough level land for the Court-House\nto stand on. Let no man think this a trivial issue. There had been a\nsimilar one over on the Virginia side once, and the opposing factions\nagreed to decide the question by the ancient wager of battle, fist and\nskull--two hundred men on each side--and the women of the county with\ndifficulty prevented the fight. Just now, Mr. Budd was on his way to\n“The Pocket”--the voting place of one faction--where he had never been,\nwhere the hostility against him was most bitter, and, that day, he knew\nhe was “up against” Waterloo, the crossing of the Rubicon, holding the\npass at Thermopylae, or any other historical crisis in the history of\nman. I was saddling the mules when the cackling of geese in the creek\nannounced the coming of the Hon. Samuel Budd, coming with his chin on\nhis breast-deep in thought. Still his eyes beamed cheerily, he lifted\nhis slouched hat gallantly to the Blight and the little sister, and he\nwould wait for us to jog along with him. I told him of our troubles,\nmeanwhile. The Wild Dog had restored our mules and the Hon. Sam beamed:\n\n“He's a wonder--where is he?”\n\n“He never waited--even for thanks.”\n\nAgain the Hon. Sam beamed:\n\n“Ah! just like him. He's gone ahead to help me.”\n\n“Well, how did he happen to be here?” I asked.\n\n“He's everywhere,” said the Hon. Sam.\n\n“How did he know the mules were ours?”\n\n“Easy. That boy knows everything.”\n\n“Well, why did he bring them back and then leave so mysteriously?”\n\nThe Hon. Sam silently pointed a finger at the laughing Blight ahead, and\nI looked incredulous.\n\n“Just the same, that's another reason I told you to warn Marston. He's\nalready got it in his head that Marston is his rival.”\n\n“Pshaw!” I said--for it was too ridiculous.\n\n“All right,” said the Hon. Sam placidly.\n\n“Then why doesn't he want to see her?” “How do you know he ain't\nwatchin' her now, for all we know? Mark me,” he added, “you won't see\nhim at the speakin', but I'll bet fruit cake agin gingerbread he'll be\nsomewhere around.”\n\nSo we went on, the two girls leading the way and the Hon. Sam now\ntelling his political troubles to me. Half a mile down the road, a\nsolitary horseman stood waiting, and Mr. Budd gave a low whistle.\n\n“One o' my rivals,” he said, from the corner of his mouth.\n\n“Mornin',” said the horseman; “lemme see you a minute.”\n\nHe made a movement to draw aside, but the Hon. Samuel made a\ncounter-gesture of dissent.\n\n“This gentleman is a friend of mine,” he said firmly, but with great\ncourtesy, “and he can hear what you have to say to me.”\n\nThe mountaineer rubbed one huge hand over his stubbly chin, threw one of\nhis long legs over the pommel of his saddle, and dangled a heavy cowhide\nshoe to and fro.\n\n“Would you mind tellin' me whut pay a member of the House of Legislatur'\ngits a day?”\n\nThe Hon. Sam looked surprised.\n\n“I think about two dollars and a half.”\n\n“An' his meals?”\n\n“No!” laughed Mr. Budd.\n\n“Well, look-ee here, stranger. I'm a pore man an' I've got a mortgage\non my farm. That money don't mean nothin' to you--but if you'll draw out\nnow an' I win, I'll tell ye whut I'll do.” He paused as though to make\nsure that the sacrifice was possible. “I'll just give ye half of that\ntwo dollars and a half a day, as shore as you're a-settin' on that hoss,\nand you won't hav' to hit a durn lick to earn it.”\n\nI had not the heart to smile--nor did the Hon. Samuel--so artless and\nsimple was the man and so pathetic his appeal.\n\n“You see--you'll divide my vote, an' ef we both run, ole Josh Barton'll\ngit it shore. Ef you git out o' the way, I can lick him easy.”\n\nMr. Budd's answer was kind, instructive, and uplifted.\n\n“My friend,” said he, “I'm sorry, but I cannot possibly accede to your\nrequest for the following reasons: First, it would not be fair to my\nconstituents; secondly, it would hardly be seeming to barter the noble\ngift of the people to which we both aspire; thirdly, you might lose with\nme out of the way; and fourthly, I'm going to win whether you are in the\nway or not.”\n\nThe horseman slowly collapsed while the Hon. Samuel was talking, and\nnow he threw the leg back, kicked for his stirrup twice, spat once, and\nturned his horse's head.\n\n“I reckon you will, stranger,” he said sadly, “with that gift o' gab\no' yourn.” He turned without another word or nod of good-by and started\nback up the creek whence he had come.\n\n“One gone,” said the Hon. Samuel Budd grimly, “and I swear I'm right\nsorry for him.” And so was I.\n\nAn hour later we struck the river, and another hour upstream brought\nus to where the contest of tongues was to come about. No sylvan dell\nin Arcady could have been lovelier than the spot. Above the road, a big\nspring poured a clear little stream over shining pebbles into the river;\nabove it the bushes hung thick with autumn leaves, and above them stood\nyellow beeches like pillars of pale fire. On both sides of the road sat\nand squatted the honest voters, sour-looking, disgruntled--a distinctly\nhostile crowd. The Blight and my little sister drew great and curious\nattention as they sat on a bowlder above the spring while I went with\nthe Hon. Samuel Budd under the guidance of Uncle Tommie Hendricks, who\nintroduced him right and left. The Hon. Samuel was cheery, but he was\nplainly nervous. There were two lanky youths whose names, oddly enough,\nwere Budd. As they gave him their huge paws in lifeless fashion, the\nHon. Samuel slapped one on the shoulder, with the true democracy of the\npolitician, and said jocosely:\n\n“Well, we Budds may not be what you call great people, but, thank God,\nnone of us have ever been in the penitentiary,” and he laughed loudly,\nthinking that he had scored a great and jolly point. The two young men\nlooked exceedingly grave and Uncle Tommie panic-stricken. He plucked the\nHon. Sam by the sleeve and led him aside:\n\n“I reckon you made a leetle mistake thar. Them two fellers' daddy died\nin the penitentiary last spring.” The Hon. Sam whistled mournfully,\nbut he looked game enough when his opponent rose to speak--Uncle Josh\nBarton, who had short, thick, upright hair, little sharp eyes, and a\nrasping voice. Uncle Josh wasted no time:\n\n“Feller-citizens,” he shouted, “this man is a lawyer--he's a corporation\nlawyer”; the fearful name--pronounced “lie-yer”--rang through the crowd\nlike a trumpet, and like lightning the Hon. Sam was on his feet.\n\n“The man who says that is a liar,” he said calmly, “and I demand your\nauthority for the statement. If you won't give it--I shall hold you\npersonally responsible, sir.”\n\nIt was a strike home, and under the flashing eyes that stared\nunwaveringly, through the big goggles, Uncle Josh halted and stammered\nand admitted that he might have been misinformed.\n\n“Then I advise you to be more careful,” cautioned the Hon. Samuel\nsharply.\n\n“Feller-citizens,” said Uncle Josh, “if he ain't a corporation\nlawyer--who is this man? Where did he come from? I have been born and\nraised among you. You all know me--do you know him? Whut's he a-doin'\nnow? He's a fine-haired furriner, an' he's come down hyeh from the\nsettlemints to tell ye that you hain't got no man in yo' own deestrict\nthat's fittin' to represent ye in the legislatur'. Look at him--look at\nhim! He's got FOUR eyes! Look at his hair--hit's PARTED IN THE MIDDLE!”\n There was a storm of laughter--Uncle Josh had made good--and if the Hon.\nSamuel could straightway have turned bald-headed and sightless, he\nwould have been a happy man. He looked sick with hopelessness, but Uncle\nTommie Hendricks, his mentor, was vigorously whispering something in\nhis ear, and gradually his face cleared. Indeed, the Hon. Samuel was\nsmilingly confident when he rose.\n\nLike his rival, he stood in the open road, and the sun beat down on his\nparted yellow hair, so that the eyes of all could see, and the laughter\nwas still running round.\n\n“Who is your Uncle Josh?” he asked with threatening mildness. “I know\nI was not born here, but, my friends, I couldn't help that. And just\nas soon as I could get away from where I was born, I came here and,”\n he paused with lips parted and long finger outstretched,\n“and--I--came--because--I WANTED--to come--and NOT because I HAD TO.”\n\nNow it seems that Uncle Josh, too, was not a native and that he had left\nhome early in life for his State's good and for his own. Uncle Tommie\nhad whispered this, and the Hon. Samuel raised himself high on both toes\nwhile the expectant crowd, on the verge of a roar, waited--as did Uncle\nJoshua, with a sickly smile.\n\n“Why did your Uncle Josh come among you? Because he was hoop-poled away\nfrom home.” Then came the roar--and the Hon. Samuel had to quell it with\nuplifted hand.\n\n“And did your Uncle Joshua marry a mountain wife? No I He didn't think\nany of your mountain women were good enough for him, so he slips down\ninto the settlemints and STEALS one. And now, fellow-citizens, that is\njust what I'm here for--I'm looking for a nice mountain girl, and I'm\ngoing to have her.” Again the Hon. Samuel had to still the roar, and\nthen he went on quietly to show how they must lose the Court-House site\nif they did not send him to the legislature, and how, while they might\nnot get it if they did send him, it was their only hope to send only\nhim. The crowd had grown somewhat hostile again, and it was after one\ntelling period, when the Hon. Samuel stopped to mop his brow, that a\ngigantic mountaineer rose in the rear of the crowd:\n\n“Talk on, stranger; you're talking sense. I'll trust ye. You've got big\nears!”\n\nNow the Hon. Samuel possessed a primordial talent that is rather rare in\nthese physically degenerate days. He said nothing, but stood quietly in\nthe middle of the road. The eyes of the crowd on either side of the road\nbegan to bulge, the lips of all opened with wonder, and a simultaneous\nburst of laughter rose around the Hon. Samuel Budd. A dozen men sprang\nto their feet and rushed up to him--looking at those remarkable ears, as\nthey gravely wagged to and fro. That settled things, and as we left,\nthe Hon. Sam was having things his own way, and on the edge of the crowd\nUncle Tommie Hendricks was shaking his head:\n\n“I tell ye, boys, he ain't no jackass even if he can flop his ears.”\n\nAt the river we started upstream, and some impulse made me turn in my\nsaddle and look back. All the time I had had an eye open for the young\nmountaineer whose interest in us seemed to be so keen. And now I saw,\nstanding at the head of a gray horse, on the edge of the crowd, a tall\nfigure with his hands on his hips and looking after us. I couldn't be\nsure, but it looked like the Wild Dog.\n\n\n\n\nIV. CLOSE QUARTERS\n\nTwo hours up the river we struck Buck. Buck was sitting on the fence by\nthe roadside, barefooted and hatless.\n\n“How-dye-do?” I said.\n\n“Purty well,” said Buck.\n\n“Any fish in this river?”\n\n“Several,” said Buck. Now in mountain speech, “several” means simply “a\ngood many.”\n\n“Any minnows in these branches?”\n\n“I seed several in the branch back o' our house.”\n\n“How far away do you live?”\n\n“Oh, 'bout one whoop an' a holler.” If he had spoken Greek the Blight\ncould not have been more puzzled. He meant he lived as far as a man's\nvoice would carry with one yell and a holla.\n\n“Will you help me catch some?” Buck nodded.\n\n“All right,” I said, turning my horse up to the fence. “Get on behind.”\n The horse shied his hind quarters away, and I pulled him back.\n\n“Now, you can get on, if you'll be quick.” Buck sat still.\n\n“Yes,” he said imperturbably; “but I ain't quick.” The two girls laughed\naloud, and Buck looked surprised.\n\nAround a curving cornfield we went, and through a meadow which Buck said\nwas a “nigh cut.” From the limb of a tree that we passed hung a piece\nof wire with an iron ring swinging at its upturned end. A little farther\nwas another tree and another ring, and farther on another and another.\n\n“For heaven's sake, Buck, what are these things?”\n\n“Mart's a-gittin' ready fer a tourneyment.”\n\n“A what?”\n\n“That's whut Mart calls hit. He was over to the Gap last Fourth o' July,\nan' he says fellers over thar fix up like Kuklux and go a-chargin' on\nhosses and takin' off them rings with a ash-stick--'spear,' Mart calls\nhit. He come back an' he says he's a-goin' to win that ar tourneyment\nnext Fourth o' July. He's got the best hoss up this river, and on\nSundays him an' Dave Branham goes a-chargin' along here a-picking off\nthese rings jus' a-flyin'; an' Mart can do hit, I'm tellin' ye. Dave's\nmighty good hisself, but he ain't nowhar 'longside o' Mart.”\n\nThis was strange. I had told the Blight about our Fourth of July, and\nhow on the Virginia side the ancient custom of the tournament still\nsurvived. It was on the last Fourth of July that she had meant to come\nto the Gap. Truly civilization was spreading throughout the hills.\n\n“Who's Mart?”\n\n“Mart's my brother,” said little Buck.\n\n“He was over to the Gap not long ago, an' he come back mad as hops--” He\nstopped suddenly, and in such a way that I turned my head, knowing that\ncaution had caught Buck.\n\n“What about?”\n\n“Oh, nothin',” said Buck carelessly; “only he's been quar ever since.\nMy sisters says he's got a gal over thar, an' he's a-pickin' off these\nrings more'n ever now. He's going to win or bust a belly-band.”\n\n“Well, who's Dave Branham?”\n\nBuck grinned. “You jes axe my sister Mollie. Thar she is.”\n\nBefore us was a white-framed house of logs in the porch of which\nstood two stalwart, good-looking girls. Could we stay all night? We\ncould--there was no hesitation--and straight in we rode.\n\n“Where's your father?” Both girls giggled, and one said, with frank\nunembarrassment:\n\n“Pap's tight!” That did not look promising, but we had to stay just\nthe same. Buck helped me to unhitch the mules, helped me also to catch\nminnows, and in half an hour we started down the river to try fishing\nbefore dark came. Buck trotted along.\n\n“Have you got a wagon, Buck?”\n\n“What fer?”\n\n“To bring the fish back.” Buck was not to be caught napping.\n\n“We got that sled thar, but hit won't be big enough,” he said gravely.\n“An' our two-hoss wagon's out in the cornfield. We'll have to string the\nfish, leave 'em in the river and go fer 'em in the mornin'.”\n\n“All right, Buck.” The Blight was greatly amused at Buck.\n\nTwo hundred yards down the road stood his sisters over the figure of a\nman outstretched in the road. Unashamed, they smiled at us. The man in\nthe road was “pap”--tight--and they were trying to get him home.\n\nWe cast into a dark pool farther down and fished most patiently; not a\nbite--not a nibble.\n\n“Are there any fish in here, Buck?”\n\n“Dunno--used ter be.” The shadows deepened; we must go back to the\nhouse.\n\n“Is there a dam below here, Buck?”\n\n“Yes, thar's a dam about a half-mile down the river.”\n\nI was disgusted. No wonder there were no bass in that pool.\n\n“Why didn't you tell me that before?”\n\n“You never axed me,” said Buck placidly.\n\nI began winding in my line.\n\n“Ain't no bottom to that pool,” said Buck.\n\nNow I never saw any rural community where there was not a bottomless\npool, and I suddenly determined to shake one tradition in at least one\ncommunity. So I took an extra fish-line, tied a stone to it, and climbed\ninto a canoe, Buck watching me, but not asking a word.\n\n“Get in, Buck.”\n\nSilently he got in and I pushed off--to the centre.\n\n“This the deepest part, Buck?”\n\n“I reckon so.”\n\nI dropped in the stone and the line reeled out some fifty feet and began\nto coil on the surface of the water.\n\n“I guess that's on the bottom, isn't it, Buck?”\n\nBuck looked genuinely distressed; but presently he brightened.\n\n“Yes,” he said, “ef hit ain't on a turtle's back.”\n\nLiterally I threw up both hands and back we trailed--fishless.\n\n“Reckon you won't need that two-hoss wagon,” said Buck. “No, Buck, I\nthink not.” Buck looked at the Blight and gave himself the pleasure of\nhis first chuckle. A big crackling, cheerful fire awaited us. Through\nthe door I could see, outstretched on a bed in the next room, the limp\nfigure of “pap” in alcoholic sleep. The old mother, big, kind-faced,\nexplained--and there was a heaven of kindness and charity in her\ndrawling voice.\n\n“Dad didn' often git that a-way,” she said; “but he'd been out a-huntin'\nhawgs that mornin' and had met up with some teamsters and gone to a\npolitical speakin' and had tuk a dram or two of their mean whiskey, and\nnot havin' nothin' on his stummick, hit had all gone to his head. No,\n'pap' didn't git that a-way often, and he'd be all right jes' as soon as\nhe slept it off a while.” The old woman moved about with a cane and the\nsympathetic Blight merely looked a question at her.\n\n“Yes, she'd fell down a year ago--and had sort o' hurt herself--didn't\ndo nothin', though, 'cept break one hip,” she added, in her kind,\npatient old voice. Did many people stop there? Oh, yes, sometimes\nfifteen at a time--they “never turned nobody away.” And she had a big\nfamily, little Cindy and the two big girls and Buck and Mart--who was\nout somewhere--and the hired man, and yes--“Thar was another boy, but he\nwas fitified,” said one of the big sisters.\n\n“I beg your pardon,” said the wondering Blight, but she knew that phrase\nwouldn't do, so she added politely:\n\n“What did you say?”\n\n“Fitified--Tom has fits. He's in a asylum in the settlements.”\n\n“Tom come back once an' he was all right,” said the old mother; “but he\nworried so much over them gals workin' so hard that it plum' throwed him\noff ag'in, and we had to send him back.”\n\n“Do you work pretty hard?” I asked presently. Then a story came that\nwas full of unconscious pathos, because there was no hint of\ncomplaint--simply a plain statement of daily life. They got up before\nthe men, in order to get breakfast ready; then they went with the men\ninto the fields--those two girls--and worked like men. At dark they\ngot supper ready, and after the men went to bed they worked on--washing\ndishes and clearing up the kitchen. They took it turn about getting\nsupper, and sometimes, one said, she was “so plumb tuckered out that\nshe'd drap on the bed and go to sleep ruther than eat her own supper.”\n No wonder poor Tom had to go back to the asylum. All the while the\ntwo girls stood by the fire looking, politely but minutely, at the two\nstrange girls and their curious clothes and their boots, and the way\nthey dressed their hair. Their hard life seemed to have hurt them\nnone--for both were the pictures of health--whatever that phrase means.\n\nAfter supper “pap” came in, perfectly sober, with a big ruddy face,\ngiant frame, and twinkling gray eyes. He was the man who had risen to\nspeak his faith in the Hon. Samuel Budd that day on the size of the Hon.\nSamuel's ears. He, too, was unashamed and, as he explained his plight\nagain, he did it with little apology.\n\n“I seed ye at the speakin' to-day. That man Budd is a good man. He done\nsomethin' fer a boy o' mine over at the Gap.” Like little Buck, he, too,\nstopped short. “He's a good man an' I'm a-goin' to help him.”\n\nYes, he repeated, quite irrelevantly, it was hunting hogs all day with\nnothing to eat and only mean whiskey to drink. Mart had not come in\nyet--he was “workin' out” now.\n\n“He's the best worker in these mountains,” said the old woman; “Mart\nworks too hard.”\n\nThe hired man appeared and joined us at the fire. Bedtime came, and I\nwhispered jokingly to the Blight:\n\n“I believe I'll ask that good-looking one to 'set up' with me.” “Settin'\nup” is what courting is called in the hills. The couple sit up in front\nof the fire after everybody else has gone to bed. The man puts his arm\naround the girl's neck and whispers; then she puts her arm around his\nneck and whispers--so that the rest may not hear. This I had related to\nthe Blight, and now she withered me.\n\n“You just do, now!”\n\nI turned to the girl in question, whose name was Mollie. “Buck told me\nto ask you who Dave Branham was.” Mollie wheeled, blushing and angry,\nbut Buck had darted cackling out the door. “Oh,” I said, and I changed\nthe subject. “What time do you get up?”\n\n“Oh, 'bout crack o' day.” I was tired, and that was discouraging.\n\n“Do you get up that early every morning?”\n\n“No,” was the quick answer; “a mornin' later.”\n\nA morning later, Mollie got up, each morning. The Blight laughed.\n\nPretty soon the two girls were taken into the next room, which was a\nlong one, with one bed in one dark corner, one in the other, and a third\nbed in the middle. The feminine members of the family all followed them\nout on the porch and watched them brush their teeth, for they had never\nseen tooth-brushes before. They watched them prepare for bed--and I\ncould hear much giggling and comment and many questions, all of which\nculminated, by and by, in a chorus of shrieking laughter. That climax,\nas I learned next morning, was over the Blight's hot-water bag. Never\nhad their eyes rested on an article of more wonder and humor than that\nwater bag.\n\nBy and by, the feminine members came back and we sat around the fire.\nStill Mart did not appear, though somebody stepped into the kitchen, and\nfrom the warning glance that Mollie gave Buck when she left the room I\nguessed that the newcomer was her lover Dave. Pretty soon the old man\nyawned.\n\n“Well, mammy, I reckon this stranger's about ready to lay down, if\nyou've got a place fer him.”\n\n“Git a light, Buck,” said the old woman. Buck got a light--a\nchimneyless, smoking oil-lamp--and led me into the same room where the\nBlight and my little sister were. Their heads were covered up, but\nthe bed in the gloom of one corner was shaking with their smothered\nlaughter. Buck pointed to the middle bed.\n\n“I can get along without that light, Buck,” I said, and I must have\nbeen rather haughty and abrupt, for a stifled shriek came from under the\nbedclothes in the corner and Buck disappeared swiftly. Preparations for\nbed are simple in the mountains--they were primitively simple for me\nthat night. Being in knickerbockers, I merely took off my coat and\nshoes. Presently somebody else stepped into the room and the bed in the\nother corner creaked. Silence for a while. Then the door opened, and the\nhead of the old woman was thrust in.\n\n“Mart!” she said coaxingly; “git up thar now an' climb over inter bed\nwith that ar stranger.”\n\nThat was Mart at last, over in the corner. Mart turned, grumbled, and,\nto my great pleasure, swore that he wouldn't. The old woman waited a\nmoment.\n\n“Mart,” she said again with gentle imperiousness, “git up thar now, I\ntell ye--you've got to sleep with that thar stranger.”\n\nShe closed the door and with a snort Mart piled into bed with me. I\ngave him plenty of room and did not introduce myself. A little more dark\nsilence--the shaking of the bed under the hilarity of those astonished,\nbethrilled, but thoroughly unfrightened young women in the dark corner\non my left ceased, and again the door opened. This time it was the hired\nman, and I saw that the trouble was either that neither Mart nor Buck\nwanted to sleep with the hired man or that neither wanted to sleep\nwith me. A long silence and then the boy Buck slipped in. The hired man\ndelivered himself with the intonation somewhat of a circuit rider.\n\n“I've been a-watchin' that star thar, through the winder. Sometimes hit\nmoves, then hit stands plum' still, an' ag'in hit gits to pitchin'.” The\nhired man must have been touching up mean whiskey himself. Meanwhile,\nMart seemed to be having spells of troubled slumber. He would snore\ngently, accentuate said snore with a sudden quiver of his body and then\nwake up with a climacteric snort and start that would shake the bed.\nThis was repeated several times, and I began to think of the unfortunate\nTom who was “fitified.” Mart seemed on the verge of a fit himself, and\nI waited apprehensively for each snorting climax to see if fits were a\nfamily failing. They were not. Peace overcame Mart and he slept deeply,\nbut not I. The hired man began to show symptoms. He would roll and\ngroan, dreaming of feuds, _quorum pars magna fuit_, it seemed, and of\nreligious conversion, in which he feared he was not so great. Twice he\nsaid aloud:\n\n“An' I tell you thar wouldn't a one of 'em have said a word if I'd been\nkilled stone-dead.” Twice he said it almost weepingly, and now and then\nhe would groan appealingly:\n\n“O Lawd, have mercy on my pore soul!”\n\nFortunately those two tired girls slept--I could hear their\nbreathing--but sleep there was little for me. Once the troubled soul\nwith the hoe got up and stumbled out to the water-bucket on the porch to\nsoothe the fever or whatever it was that was burning him, and after that\nhe was quiet. I awoke before day. The dim light at the window showed an\nempty bed--Buck and the hired man were gone. Mart was slipping out of\nthe side of my bed, but the girls still slept on. I watched Mart, for\nI guessed I might now see what, perhaps, is the distinguishing trait of\nAmerican civilization down to its bed-rock, as you find it through the\nWest and in the Southern hills--a chivalrous respect for women. Mart\nthought I was asleep. Over in the corner were two creatures the like of\nwhich I supposed he had never seen and would not see, since he came in\ntoo late the night before, and was going away too early now--and two\nangels straight from heaven could not have stirred my curiosity any more\nthan they already must have stirred his. But not once did Mart turn his\neyes, much less his face, toward the corner where they were--not once,\nfor I watched him closely. And when he went out he sent his little\nsister back for his shoes, which the night-walking hired man had\naccidentally kicked toward the foot of the strangers' bed. In a minute I\nwas out after him, but he was gone. Behind me the two girls opened their\neyes on a room that was empty save for them. Then the Blight spoke (this\nI was told later).\n\n“Dear,” she said, “have our room-mates gone?”\n\nBreakfast at dawn. The mountain girls were ready to go to work. All\nlooked sorry to have us leave. They asked us to come back again, and\nthey meant it. We said we would like to come back--and we meant it--to\nsee them--the kind old mother, the pioneer-like old man, sturdy little\nBuck, shy little Cindy, the elusive, hard-working, unconsciously shivery\nMart, and the two big sisters. As we started back up the river the\nsisters started for the fields, and I thought of their stricken brother\nin the settlements, who must have been much like Mart.\n\nBack up the Big Black Mountain we toiled, and late in the afternoon we\nwere on the State line that runs the crest of the Big Black. Right on\ntop and bisected by that State line sat a dingy little shack, and there,\nwith one leg thrown over the pommel of his saddle, sat Marston, drinking\nwater from a gourd.\n\n“I was coming over to meet you,” he said, smiling at the Blight, who,\ngreatly pleased, smiled back at him. The shack was a “blind Tiger”\n where whiskey could be sold to Kentuckians on the Virginia side and\nto Virginians on the Kentucky side. Hanging around were the slouching\nfigures of several moonshiners and the villainous fellow who ran it.\n\n“They are real ones all right,” said Marston. “One of them killed a\nrevenue officer at that front door last week, and was killed by the\nposse as he was trying to escape out of the back window. That house will\nbe in ashes soon,” he added. And it was.\n\nAs we rode down the mountain we told him about our trip and the people\nwith whom we had spent the night--and all the time he was smiling\ncuriously.\n\n“Buck,” he said. “Oh, yes, I know that little chap. Mart had him posted\ndown there on the river to toll you to his house--to toll YOU,” he added\nto the Blight. He pulled in his horse suddenly, turned and looked up\ntoward the top of the mountain.\n\n“Ah, I thought so.” We all looked back. On the edge of the cliff, far\nupward, on which the “blind Tiger” sat was a gray horse, and on it was a\nman who, motionless, was looking down at us.\n\n“He's been following you all the way,” said the engineer.\n\n“Who's been following us?” I asked.\n\n“That's Mart up there--my friend and yours,” said Marston to the\nBlight. “I'm rather glad I didn't meet you on the other side of the\nmountain--that's 'the Wild Dog.'” The Blight looked incredulous, but\nMarston knew the man and knew the horse.\n\nSo Mart--hard-working Mart--was the Wild Dog, and he was content to\ndo the Blight all service without thanks, merely for the privilege of\nsecretly seeing her face now and then; and yet he would not look upon\nthat face when she was a guest under his roof and asleep.\n\nStill, when we dropped behind the two girls I gave Marston the Hon.\nSam's warning, and for a moment he looked rather grave.\n\n“Well,” he said, smiling, “if I'm found in the road some day, you'll\nknow who did it.”\n\nI shook my head. “Oh, no; he isn't that bad.”\n\n“I don't know,” said Marston.\n\n\nThe smoke of the young engineer's coke ovens lay far below us and the\nBlight had never seen a coke-plant before. It looked like Hades even\nin the early dusk--the snake-like coil of fiery ovens stretching up the\nlong, deep ravine, and the smoke-streaked clouds of fire, trailing like\na yellow mist over them, with a fierce white blast shooting up here\nand there when the lid of an oven was raised, as though to add fresh\ntemperature to some particular male-factor in some particular chamber\nof torment. Humanity about was joyous, however. Laughter and banter\nand song came from the cabins that lined the big ravine and the little\nravines opening into it. A banjo tinkled at the entrance of “Possum\nTrot,” sacred to the darkies. We moved toward it. On the stoop sat an\necstatic picker and in the dust shuffled three pickaninnies--one boy and\ntwo girls--the youngest not five years old. The crowd that was gathered\nabout them gave way respectfully as we drew near; the little darkies\nshowed their white teeth in jolly grins, and their feet shook the dust\nin happy competition. I showered a few coins for the Blight and on we\nwent--into the mouth of the many-peaked Gap. The night train was coming\nin and everybody had a smile of welcome for the Blight--post-office\nassistant, drug clerk, soda-water boy, telegraph operator, hostler,\nwho came for the mules--and when tired, but happy, she slipped from\nher saddle to the ground, she then and there gave me what she usually\nreserves for Christmas morning, and that, too, while Marston was looking\non. Over her shoulder I smiled at him.\n\n\nThat night Marston and the Blight sat under the vines on the porch\nuntil the late moon rose over Wallens Ridge, and, when bedtime came, the\nBlight said impatiently that she did not want to go home. She had to go,\nhowever, next day, but on the next Fourth of July she would surely come\nagain; and, as the young engineer mounted his horse and set his face\ntoward Black Mountain, I knew that until that day, for him, a blight\nwould still be in the hills.\n\n\n\n\nV. BACK TO THE HILLS\n\nWinter drew a gray veil over the mountains, wove into it tiny jewels of\nfrost and turned it many times into a mask of snow, before spring broke\nagain among them and in Marston's impatient heart. No spring had ever\nbeen like that to him. The coming of young leaves and flowers and\nbird-song meant but one joy for the hills to him--the Blight was coming\nback to them. All those weary waiting months he had clung grimly to his\nwork. He must have heard from her sometimes, else I think he would have\ngone to her; but I knew the Blight's pen was reluctant and casual for\nanybody, and, moreover, she was having a strenuous winter at home. That\nhe knew as well, for he took one paper, at least, that he might simply\nread her name. He saw accounts of her many social doings as well, and\nate his heart out as lovers have done for all time gone and will do for\nall time to come.\n\nI, too, was away all winter, but I got back a month before the Blight,\nto learn much of interest that had come about. The Hon. Samuel Budd had\near-wagged himself into the legislature, had moved that Court-House, and\nwas going to be State Senator. The Wild Dog had confined his reckless\ncareer to his own hills through the winter, but when spring came,\nmigratory-like, he began to take frequent wing to the Gap. So far, he\nand Marston had never come into personal conflict, though Marston kept\never ready for him, and several times they had met in the road, eyed\neach other in passing and made no hipward gesture at all. But then\nMarston had never met him when the Wild Dog was drunk--and when sober, I\ntook it that the one act of kindness from the engineer always stayed his\nhand. But the Police Guard at the Gap saw him quite often--and to it he\nwas a fearful and elusive nuisance. He seemed to be staying somewhere\nwithin a radius of ten miles, for every night or two he would circle\nabout the town, yelling and firing his pistol, and when we chased him,\nescaping through the Gap or up the valley or down in Lee. Many plans\nwere laid to catch him, but all failed, and finally he came in one day\nand gave himself up and paid his fines. Afterward I recalled that\nthe time of this gracious surrender to law and order was but little\nsubsequent to one morning when a woman who brought butter and eggs to my\nlittle sister casually asked when that “purty slim little gal with the\nsnappin' black eyes was a-comin' back.” And the little sister, pleased\nwith the remembrance, had said cordially that she was coming soon.\n\nThereafter the Wild Dog was in town every day, and he behaved well until\none Saturday he got drunk again, and this time, by a peculiar chance, it\nwas Marston again who leaped on him, wrenched his pistol away, and put\nhim in the calaboose. Again he paid his fine, promptly visited a “blind\nTiger,” came back to town, emptied another pistol at Marston on sight\nand fled for the hills.\n\nThe enraged guard chased him for two days and from that day the Wild Dog\nwas a marked man. The Guard wanted many men, but if they could have had\ntheir choice they would have picked out of the world of malefactors that\nsame Wild Dog.\n\nWhy all this should have thrown the Hon. Samuel Budd into such gloom\nI could not understand--except that the Wild Dog had been so loyal a\nhenchman to him in politics, but later I learned a better reason, that\nthreatened to cost the Hon. Sam much more than the fines that, as I\nlater learned, he had been paying for his mountain friend.\n\nMeanwhile, the Blight was coming from her Northern home through the\ngreen lowlands of Jersey, the fat pastures of Maryland, and, as the\nwhite dresses of schoolgirls and the shining faces of darkies thickened\nat the stations, she knew that she was getting southward. All the way\nshe was known and welcomed, and next morning she awoke with the keen air\nof the distant mountains in her nostrils and an expectant light in her\nhappy eyes. At least the light was there when she stepped daintily from\nthe dusty train and it leaped a little, I fancied, when Marston, bronzed\nand flushed, held out his sunburnt hand. Like a convent girl she babbled\nquestions to the little sister as the dummy puffed along and she bubbled\nlike wine over the midsummer glory of the hills. And well she might, for\nthe glory of the mountains, full-leafed, shrouded in evening shadows,\nblue-veiled in the distance, was unspeakable, and through the Gap the\nsun was sending his last rays as though he, too, meant to take a peep at\nher before he started around the world to welcome her next day. And she\nmust know everything at once. The anniversary of the Great Day on which\nall men were pronounced free and equal was only ten days distant and\npreparations were going on. There would be a big crowd of mountaineers\nand there would be sports of all kinds, and games, but the tournament\nwas to be the feature of the day.\n\n“A tournament?” “Yes, a tournament,” repeated the little sister,\nand Marston was going to ride and the mean thing would not tell what\nmediaeval name he meant to take. And the Hon. Sam Budd--did the Blight\nremember him? (Indeed, she did)--had a “dark horse,” and he had bet\nheavily that his dark horse would win the tournament--whereat the little\nsister looked at Marston and at the Blight and smiled disdainfully. And\nthe Wild Dog--DID she remember him? I checked the sister here with a\nglance, for Marston looked uncomfortable and the Blight saw me do it,\nand on the point of saying something she checked herself, and her face,\nI thought, paled a little.\n\nThat night I learned why--when she came in from the porch after Marston\nwas gone. I saw she had wormed enough of the story out of him to worry\nher, for her face this time was distinctly pale. I would tell her no\nmore than she knew, however, and then she said she was sure she had seen\nthe Wild Dog herself that afternoon, sitting on his horse in the bushes\nnear a station in Wildcat Valley. She was sure that he saw her, and his\nface had frightened her. I knew her fright was for Marston and not for\nherself, so I laughed at her fears. She was mistaken--Wild Dog was an\noutlaw now and he would not dare appear at the Gap, and there was no\nchance that he could harm her or Marston. And yet I was uneasy.\n\nIt must have been a happy ten days for those two young people. Every\nafternoon Marston would come in from the mines and they would go off\nhorseback together, over ground that I well knew--for I had been all\nover it myself--up through the gray-peaked rhododendron-bordered Gap\nwith the swirling water below them and the gray rock high above where\nanother such foolish lover lost his life, climbing to get a flower for\nhis sweetheart, or down the winding dirt road into Lee, or up through\nthe beech woods behind Imboden Hill, or climbing the spur of Morris's\nFarm to watch the sunset over the majestic Big Black Mountains, where\nthe Wild Dog lived, and back through the fragrant, cool, moonlit woods.\nHe was doing his best, Marston was, and he was having trouble--as every\nman should. And that trouble I knew even better than he, for I had once\nknown a Southern girl who was so tender of heart that she could refuse\nno man who really loved her she accepted him and sent him to her father,\nwho did all of her refusing for her. And I knew no man would know that\nhe had won the Blight until he had her at the altar and the priestly\nhand of benediction was above her head.\n\nOf such kind was the Blight. Every night when they came in I could read\nthe story of the day, always in his face and sometimes in hers; and\nit was a series of ups and downs that must have wrung the boy's heart\nbloodless. Still I was in good hope for him, until the crisis came\non the night before the Fourth. The quarrel was as plain as though\ntypewritten on the face of each. Marston would not come in that night\nand the Blight went dinnerless to bed and cried herself to sleep. She\ntold the little sister that she had seen the Wild Dog again peering\nthrough the bushes, and that she was frightened. That was her\nexplanation--but I guessed a better one.\n\n\n\n\nVI. THE GREAT DAY\n\nIt was a day to make glad the heart of slave or freeman. The earth was\ncool from a night-long rain, and a gentle breeze fanned coolness\nfrom the north all day long. The clouds were snow-white, tumbling,\never-moving, and between them the sky showed blue and deep. Grass, leaf,\nweed and flower were in the richness that comes to the green things of\nthe earth just before that full tide of summer whose foam is drifting\nthistle down. The air was clear and the mountains seemed to have brushed\nthe haze from their faces and drawn nearer that they, too, might better\nsee the doings of that day.\n\nFrom the four winds of heaven, that morning, came the brave and the\nfree. Up from Lee, down from Little Stone Gap, and from over in Scott,\ncame the valley-farmers--horseback, in buggies, hacks, two-horse wagons,\nwith wives, mothers, sisters, sweethearts, in white dresses, flowered\nhats, and many ribbons, and with dinner-baskets stuffed with good things\nto eat--old ham, young chicken, angel-cake and blackberry wine--to be\nspread in the sunless shade of great poplar and oak. From Bum Hollow and\nWildcat Valley and from up the slopes that lead to Cracker's Neck came\nsmaller tillers of the soil--as yet but faintly marked by the gewgaw\ntrappings of the outer world; while from beyond High Knob, whose crown\nis in cloud-land, and through the Gap, came the mountaineer in the\nprimitive simplicity of home spun and cowhide, wide-brimmed hat and\npoke-bonnet, quaint speech, and slouching gait. Through the Gap he came\nin two streams--the Virginians from Crab Orchard and Wise and Dickinson,\nthe Kentuckians from Letcher and feudal Harlan, beyond the Big\nBlack--and not a man carried a weapon in sight, for the stern spirit of\nthat Police Guard at the Gap was respected wide and far. Into the town,\nwhich sits on a plateau some twenty feet above the level of the two\nrivers that all but encircle it, they poured, hitching their horses in\nthe strip of woods that runs through the heart of the place, and broad\nens into a primeval park that, fan-like, opens on the oval level field\nwhere all things happen on the Fourth of July. About the street they\nloitered--lovers hand in hand--eating fruit and candy and drinking\nsoda-water, or sat on the curb-stone, mothers with babies at their\nbreasts and toddling children clinging close--all waiting for the\ncelebration to begin.\n\nIt was a great day for the Hon. Samuel Budd. With a cheery smile and\nbeaming goggles, he moved among his constituents, joking with yokels,\nsaying nice things to mothers, paying gallantries to girls, and chucking\nbabies under the chin. He felt popular and he was--so popular that he\nhad begun to see himself with prophetic eye in a congressional seat at\nno distant day; and yet, withal, he was not wholly happy.\n\n“Do you know,” he said, “them fellers I made bets with in the tournament\ngot together this morning and decided, all of 'em, that they wouldn't\nlet me off? Jerusalem, it's most five hundred dollars!” And, looking\nthe picture of dismay, he told me his dilemma. It seems that his “dark\nhorse” was none other than the Wild Dog, who had been practising at home\nfor this tournament for nearly a year; and now that the Wild Dog was an\noutlaw, he, of course, wouldn't and couldn't come to the Gap. And said\nthe Hon. Sam Budd:\n\n“Them fellers says I bet I'd BRING IN a dark horse who would win this\ntournament, and if I don't BRING him in, I lose just the same as though\nI had brought him in and he hadn't won. An' I reckon they've got me.”\n\n“I guess they have.”\n\n“It would have been like pickin' money off a blackberry-bush, for I was\ngoin' to let the Wild Dog have that black horse o' mine--the steadiest\nand fastest runner in this country--and my, how that fellow can pick off\nthe rings! He's been a-practising for a year, and I believe he could run\nthe point o' that spear of his through a lady's finger-ring.”\n\n“You'd better get somebody else.”\n\n“Ah--that's it. The Wild Dog sent word he'd send over another feller,\nnamed Dave Branham, who has been practising with him, who's just as\ngood, he says, as he is. I'm looking for him at twelve o'clock, an' I'm\ngoin' to take him down an' see what he can do on that black horse o'\nmine. But if he's no good, I lose five hundred, all right,” and he\nsloped away to his duties. For it was the Hon. Sam who was master\nof ceremonies that day. He was due now to read the Declaration of\nIndependence in a poplar grove to all who would listen; he was to act as\numpire at the championship base-ball game in the afternoon, and he was\nto give the “Charge” to the assembled knights before the tournament.\n\nAt ten o'clock the games began--and I took the Blight and the little\nsister down to the “grandstand”--several tiers of backless benches with\nleaves for a canopy and the river singing through rhododendrons behind.\nThere was jumping broad and high, and a 100-yard dash and hurdling and\nthrowing the hammer, which the Blight said were not interesting--they\nwere too much like college sports--and she wanted to see the base-ball\ngame and the tournament. And yet Marston was in them all--dogged and\nresistless--his teeth set and his eyes anywhere but lifted toward the\nBlight, who secretly proud, as I believed, but openly defiant, mentioned\nnot his name even when he lost, which was twice only.\n\n“Pretty good, isn't he?” I said.\n\n“Who?” she said indifferently.\n\n“Oh, nobody,” I said, turning to smile, but not turning quickly enough.\n\n“What's the matter with you?” asked the Blight sharply.\n\n“Nothing, nothing at all,” I said, and straightway the Blight thought\nshe wanted to go home. The thunder of the Declaration was still rumbling\nin the poplar grove.\n\n“That's the Hon. Sam Budd,” I said.\n\n“Don't you want to hear him?”\n\n“I don't care who it is and I don't want to hear him and I think you are\nhateful.”\n\nAh, dear me, it was more serious than I thought. There were\ntears in her eyes, and I led the Blight and the little sister\nhome--conscience-stricken and humbled. Still I would find that young\njackanapes of an engineer and let him know that anybody who made the\nBlight unhappy must deal with me. I would take him by the neck and pound\nsome sense into him. I found him lofty, uncommunicative, perfectly alien\nto any consciousness that I could have any knowledge of what was going\nor any right to poke my nose into anybody's business--and I did nothing\nexcept go back to lunch--to find the Blight upstairs and the little\nsister indignant with me.\n\n“You just let them alone,” she said severely.\n\n“Let who alone?” I said, lapsing into the speech of childhood.\n\n“You--just--let--them--alone,” she repeated.\n\n“I've already made up my mind to that.”\n\n“Well, then!” she said, with an air of satisfaction, but why I don't\nknow.\n\nI went back to the poplar grove. The Declaration was over and the crowd\nwas gone, but there was the Hon. Samuel Budd, mopping his brow with\none hand, slapping his thigh with the other, and all but executing a\npigeon-wing on the turf. He turned goggles on me that literally shone\ntriumph.\n\n“He's come--Dave Branham's come!” he said. “He's better than the Wild\nDog. I've been trying him on the black horse and, Lord, how he can take\nthem rings off! Ha, won't I get into them fellows who wouldn't let me\noff this morning! Oh, yes, I agreed to bring in a dark horse, and I'll\nbring him in all right. That five hundred is in my clothes now. You see\nthat point yonder? Well, there's a hollow there and bushes all around.\nThat's where I'm going to dress him. I've got his clothes all right and\na name for him. This thing is a-goin' to come off accordin' to Hoyle,\nIvanhoe, Four-Quarters-of-Beef, and all them mediaeval fellows. Just\nwatch me!”\n\nI began to get newly interested, for that knight's name I suddenly\nrecalled. Little Buck, the Wild Dog's brother, had mentioned him, when\nwe were over in the Kentucky hills, as practising with the Wild Dog--as\nbeing “mighty good, but nowhar 'longside o' Mart.” So the Hon. Sam might\nhave a good substitute, after all, and being a devoted disciple of Sir\nWalter, I knew his knight would rival, in splendor, at least, any that\nrode with King Arthur in days of old.\n\nThe Blight was very quiet at lunch, as was the little sister, and my\neffort to be jocose was a lamentable failure. So I gave news.\n\n“The Hon. Sam has a substitute.” No curiosity and no question.\n\n“Who--did you say? Why, Dave Branham, a friend of the Wild Dog. Don't\nyou remember Buck telling us about him?” No answer. “Well, I do--and,\nby the way, I saw Buck and one of the big sisters just a while ago. Her\nname is Mollie. Dave Branham, you will recall, is her sweetheart. The\nother big sister had to stay at home with her mother and little Cindy,\nwho's sick. Of course, I didn't ask them about Mart--the Wild Dog. They\nknew I knew and they wouldn't have liked it. The Wild Dog's around, I\nunderstand, but he won't dare show his face. Every policeman in town is\non the lookout for him.” I thought the Blight's face showed a signal of\nrelief.\n\n“I'm going to play short-stop,” I added.\n\n“Oh!” said the Blight, with a smile, but the little sister said with\nsome scorn:\n\n“You!”\n\n“I'll show you,” I said, and I told the Blight about base-ball at the\nGap. We had introduced base-ball into the region and the valley boys\nand mountain boys, being swift runners, throwing like a rifle shot from\nconstant practice with stones, and being hard as nails, caught the game\nquickly and with great ease. We beat them all the time at first, but now\nthey were beginning to beat us. We had a league now, and this was the\nchampionship game for the pennant.\n\n“It was right funny the first time we beat a native team. Of course, we\ngot together and cheered 'em. They thought we were cheering ourselves,\nso they got red in the face, rushed together and whooped it up for\nthemselves for about half an hour.”\n\nThe Blight almost laughed.\n\n“We used to have to carry our guns around with us at first when we went\nto other places, and we came near having several fights.”\n\n“Oh!” said the Blight excitedly. “Do you think there might be a fight\nthis afternoon?”\n\n“Don't know,” I said, shaking my head. “It's pretty hard for eighteen\npeople to fight when nine of them are policemen and there are forty more\naround. Still the crowd might take a hand.”\n\nThis, I saw, quite thrilled the Blight and she was in good spirits when\nwe started out.\n\n“Marston doesn't pitch this afternoon,” I said to the little sister. “He\nplays first base. He's saving himself for the tournament. He's done too\nmuch already.” The Blight merely turned her head while I was speaking.\n“And the Hon. Sam will not act as umpire. He wants to save his\nvoice--and his head.”\n\nThe seats in the “grandstand” were in the sun now, so I left the\ngirls in a deserted band-stand that stood on stilts under trees on the\nsouthern side of the field, and on a line midway between third base and\nthe position of short-stop. Now there is no enthusiasm in any sport that\nequals the excitement aroused by a rural base-ball game and I never\nsaw the enthusiasm of that game outdone except by the excitement of the\ntournament that followed that afternoon. The game was close and\nMarston and I assuredly were stars--Marston one of the first magnitude.\n“Goose-egg” on one side matched “goose-egg” on the other until the end\nof the fifth inning, when the engineer knocked a home-run. Spectators\nthrew their hats into the trees, yelled themselves hoarse, and I saw\nseveral old mountaineers who understood no more of base-ball than of the\nlost _digamma_ in Greek going wild with the general contagion. During\nthese innings I had “assisted” in two doubles and had fired in three\n“daisy cutters” to first myself in spite of the guying I got from the\nopposing rooters.\n\n“Four-eyes” they called me on account of my spectacles until a new\nnickname came at the last half of the ninth inning, when we were in\nthe field with the score four to three in our favor. It was then that\na small, fat boy with a paper megaphone longer than he was waddled out\nalmost to first base and levelling his trumpet at me, thundered out in a\nsudden silence:\n\n“Hello, Foxy Grandpa!” That was too much. I got rattled, and when there\nwere three men on bases and two out, a swift grounder came to me, I\nfell--catching it--and threw wildly to first from my knees. I heard\nshouts of horror, anger, and distress from everywhere and my own heart\nstopped beating--I had lost the game--and then Marston leaped in the\nair--surely it must have been four feet--caught the ball with his left\nhand and dropped back on the bag. The sound of his foot on it and the\nrunner's was almost simultaneous, but the umpire said Marston's was\nthere first. Then bedlam! One of my brothers was umpire and the captain\nof the other team walked threateningly out toward him, followed by two\nof his men with base-ball bats. As I started off myself towards them I\nsaw, with the corner of my eye, another brother of mine start in a run\nfrom the left field, and I wondered why a third, who was scoring, sat\nperfectly still in his chair, particularly as a well-known, red-headed\ntough from one of the mines who had been officiously antagonistic ran\ntoward the pitcher's box directly in front of him. Instantly a dozen of\nthe guard sprang toward it, some man pulled his pistol, a billy cracked\nstraightway on his head, and in a few minutes order was restored. And\nstill the brother scoring hadn't moved from his chair, and I spoke to\nhim hotly.\n\n“Keep your shirt on,” he said easily, lifting his score-card with his\nleft hand and showing his right clinched about his pistol under it.\n\n“I was just waiting for that red-head to make a move. I guess I'd have\ngot him first.”\n\nI walked back to the Blight and the little sister and both of them\nlooked very serious and frightened.\n\n“I don't think I want to see a real fight, after all,” said the Blight.\n“Not this afternoon.”\n\nIt was a little singular and prophetic, but just as the words left her\nlips one of the Police Guard handed me a piece of paper.\n\n“Somebody in the crowd must have dropped it in my pocket,” he said. On\nthe paper were scrawled these words:\n\n“_Look out for the Wild Dog!_”\n\nI sent the paper to Marston.\n\n\n\n\nVII. AT LAST--THE TOURNAMENT\n\nAt last--the tournament! Ever afterward the Hon. Samuel Budd called it\n“The Gentle and Joyous Passage of Arms--not of Ashby--but of the Gap,\nby-suh!” The Hon. Samuel had arranged it as nearly after Sir Walter as\npossible. And a sudden leap it was from the most modern of games to a\ngame most ancient.\n\nNo knights of old ever jousted on a lovelier field than the green little\nvalley toward which the Hon. Sam waved one big hand. It was level,\nshorn of weeds, elliptical in shape, and bound in by trees that ran in\na semicircle around the bank of the river, shut in the southern border,\nand ran back to the northern extremity in a primeval little forest that\nwood-thrushes, even then, were making musical--all of it shut in by\na wall of living green, save for one narrow space through which the\nknights were to enter. In front waved Wallens' leafy ridge and behind\nrose the Cumberland Range shouldering itself spur by spur, into the\ncoming sunset and crashing eastward into the mighty bulk of Powell's\nMountain, which loomed southward from the head of the valley--all\nnodding sunny plumes of chestnut.\n\nThe Hon. Sam had seen us coming from afar apparently, had come forward\nto meet us, and he was in high spirits.\n\n“I am Prince John and Waldemar and all the rest of 'em this day,” he\nsaid, “and 'it is thus,'” quoting Sir Walter, “that we set the dutiful\nexample of loyalty to the Queen of Love and Beauty, and are ourselves\nher guide to the throne which she must this day occupy.” And so saying,\nthe Hon. Sam marshalled the Blight to a seat of honor next his own.\n\n“And how do you know she is going to be the Queen of Love and Beauty?”\n asked the little sister. The Hon. Sam winked at me.\n\n“Well, this tournament lies between two gallant knights. One will make\nher the Queen of his own accord, if he wins, and if the other wins, he's\ngot to, or I'll break his head. I've given orders.” And the Hon. Sam\nlooked about right and left on the people who were his that day.\n\n“Observe the nobles and ladies,” he said, still following Sir Walter,\nand waving at the towns-people and visitors in the rude grandstand.\n“Observe the yeomanry and spectators of a better degree than the mere\nvulgar”--waving at the crowd on either side of the stand--“and the\npromiscuous multitude down the river banks and over the woods and\nclinging to the tree-tops and to yon telegraph-pole. And there is my\nherald”--pointing to the cornetist of the local band--“and wait--by my\nhalidom--please just wait until you see my knight on that black charger\no' mine.”\n\nThe Blight and the little sister were convulsed and the Hon. Sam went\non:\n\n“Look at my men-at-arms”--the volunteer policemen with bulging\nhip-pockets, dangling billies and gleaming shields of office--“and at my\nrefreshment tents behind”--where peanuts and pink lemonade were keeping\nthe multitude busy--“and my attendants”--colored gentlemen with sponges\nand water-buckets--“the armorers and farriers haven't come yet. But my\nknight--I got his clothes in New York--just wait--Love of Ladies and\nGlory to the Brave!” Just then there was a commotion on the free seats\non one side of the grandstand. A darky starting, in all ignorance, to\nmount them was stopped and jostled none too good-naturedly back to the\nground.\n\n“And see,” mused the Hon. Sam, “in lieu of the dog of an unbeliever we\nhave a dark analogy in that son of Ham.”\n\nThe little sister plucked me by the sleeve and pointed toward the\nentrance. Outside and leaning on the fence were Mollie, the big sister,\nand little Buck. Straightway I got up and started for them. They hung\nback, but I persuaded them to come, and I led them to seats two tiers\nbelow the Blight--who, with my little sister, rose smiling to greet\nthem and shake hands--much to the wonder of the nobles and ladies close\nabout, for Mollie was in brave and dazzling array, blushing fiercely,\nand little Buck looked as though he would die of such conspicuousness.\nNo embarrassing questions were asked about Mart or Dave Branham, but I\nnoticed that Mollie had purple and crimson ribbons clinched in one brown\nhand. The purpose of them was plain, and I whispered to the Blight:\n\n“She's going to pin them on Dave's lance.” The Hon. Sam heard me.\n\n“Not on your life,” he said emphatically. “I ain't takin' chances,” and\nhe nodded toward the Blight. “She's got to win, no matter who loses.” He\nrose to his feet suddenly.\n\n“Glory to the Brave--they're comin'! Toot that horn, son,” he said;\n“they're comin',” and the band burst into discordant sounds that would\nhave made the “wild barbaric music” on the field of Ashby sound like a\nlullaby. The Blight stifled her laughter over that amazing music with\nher handkerchief, and even the Hon. Sam scowled.\n\n“Gee!” he said; “it is pretty bad, isn't it?”\n\n“Here they come!”\n\nThe nobles and ladies on the grandstand, the yeomanry and spectators of\nbetter degree, and the promiscuous multitude began to sway expectantly\nand over the hill came the knights, single file, gorgeous in velvets and\nin caps, with waving plumes and with polished spears, vertical, resting\non the right stirrup foot and gleaming in the sun.\n\n“A goodly array!” murmured the Hon. Sam.\n\nA crowd of small boys gathered at the fence below, and I observed the\nHon. Sam's pockets bulging with peanuts.\n\n“Largesse!” I suggested.\n\n“Good!” he said, and rising he shouted:\n\n“Largessy! largessy!” scattering peanuts by the handful among the\nscrambling urchins.\n\nDown wound the knights behind the back stand of the base-ball field, and\nthen, single file, in front of the nobles and ladies, before whom they\ndrew up and faced, saluting with inverted spears.\n\nThe Hon. Sam arose--his truncheon a hickory stick--and in a stentorian\nvoice asked the names of the doughty knights who were there to win glory\nfor themselves and the favor of fair women.\n\nNot all will be mentioned, but among them was the Knight of the\nHolston--Athelstanic in build--in black stockings, white negligee shirt,\nwith Byronic collar, and a broad crimson sash tied with a bow at his\nright side. There was the Knight of the Green Valley, in green and gold,\na green hat with a long white plume, lace ruffles at his sleeves, and\nbuckles on dancing-pumps; a bonny fat knight of Maxwelton Braes, in\nHighland kilts and a plaid; and the Knight at Large.\n\n“He ought to be caged,” murmured the Hon. Sam; for the Knight at Large\nwore plum-colored velvet, red base-ball stockings, held in place with\nsafety-pins, white tennis shoes, and a very small hat with a very long\nplume, and the dye was already streaking his face. Marston was the\nlast--sitting easily on his iron gray.\n\n“And your name, Sir Knight?”\n\n“The Discarded,” said Marston, with steady eyes. I felt the Blight start\nat my side and sidewise I saw that her face was crimson.\n\nThe Hon. Sam sat down, muttering, for he did not like Marston:\n\n“Wenchless springal!”\n\nJust then my attention was riveted on Mollie and little Buck. Both had\nbeen staring silently at the knights as though they were apparitions,\nbut when Marston faced them I saw Buck clutch his sister's arm suddenly\nand say something excitedly in her ear. Then the mouths of both\ntightened fiercely and their eyes seemed to be darting lightning at the\nunconscious knight, who suddenly saw them, recognized them, and smiled\npast them at me. Again Buck whispered, and from his lips I could make\nout what he said:\n\n“I wonder whar's Dave?” but Mollie did not answer.\n\n“Which is yours, Mr. Budd?” asked the little sister. The Hon. Sam had\nleaned back with his thumbs in the arm-holes of his white waistcoat.\n\n“He ain't come yet. I told him to come last.”\n\nThe crowd waited and the knights waited--so long that the Mayor rose in\nhis seat some twenty feet away and called out:\n\n“Go ahead, Budd.”\n\n“You jus' wait a minute--my man ain't come yet,” he said easily, but\nfrom various places in the crowd came jeering shouts from the men with\nwhom he had wagered and the Hon. Sam began to look anxious.\n\n“I wonder what is the matter?” he added in a lower tone. “I dressed him\nmyself more than an hour ago and I told him to come last, but I didn't\nmean for him to wait till Christmas--ah!”\n\nThe Hon. Sam sank back in his seat again. From somewhere had come\nsuddenly the blare of a solitary trumpet that rang in echoes around the\namphitheatre of the hills and, a moment later, a dazzling something shot\ninto sight above the mound that looked like a ball of fire, coming in\nmid-air. The new knight wore a shining helmet and the Hon. Sam chuckled\nat the murmur that rose and then he sat up suddenly. There was no face\nunder that helmet--the Hon. Sam's knight was MASKED and the Hon. Sam\nslapped his thigh with delight.\n\n“Bully--bully! I never thought of it--I never thought of it--bully!”\n\nThis was thrilling, indeed--but there was more; the strange knight's\nbody was cased in a flexible suit of glistening mail, his spear point,\nwhen he raised it on high, shone like silver, and he came on like a\nradiant star--on the Hon. Sam's charger, white-bridled, with long mane\nand tail and black from tip of nose to tip of that tail as midnight. The\nHon. Sam was certainly doing it well. At a slow walk the stranger drew\nalongside of Marston and turned his spear point downward.\n\n“Gawd!” said an old darky. “Ku-klux done come again.” And, indeed, it\nlooked like a Ku-klux mask, white, dropping below the chin, and with\neye-holes through which gleamed two bright fires.\n\nThe eyes of Buck and Mollie were turned from Marston at last, and\nopen-mouthed they stared.\n\n“Hit's the same hoss--hit's Dave!” said Buck aloud.\n\n“Well, my Lord!” said Mollie simply.\n\nThe Hon. Sam rose again.\n\n“And who is Sir Tardy Knight that hither comes with masked face?” he\nasked courteously. He got no answer.\n\n“What's your name, son?”\n\nThe white mask puffed at the wearer's lips.\n\n“The Knight of the Cumberland,” was the low, muffled reply.\n\n“Make him take that thing off!” shouted some one.\n\n“What's he got it on fer?” shouted another.\n\n“I don't know, friend,” said the Hon. Sam; “but it is not my business\nnor prithee thine; since by the laws of the tournament a knight may ride\nmasked for a specified time or until a particular purpose is achieved,\nthat purpose being, I wot, victory for himself and for me a handful of\nbyzants from thee.”\n\n“Now, go ahead, Budd,” called the Mayor again. “Are you going crazy?”\n\nThe Hon. Sam stretched out his arms once to loosen them for gesture,\nthrust his chest out, and uplifted his chin: “Fair ladies, nobles of the\nrealm, and good knights,” he said sonorously, and he raised one hand to\nhis mouth and behind it spoke aside to me:\n\n“How's my voice--how's my voice?”\n\n“Great!” His question was genuine, for the mask of humor had dropped and\nthe man was transformed. I knew his inner seriousness, his oratorical\ncommand of good English, and I knew the habit, not uncommon among\nstump-speakers in the South, of falling, through humor, carelessness, or\nfor the effect of flattering comradeship, into all the lingual sins of\nrural speech; but I was hardly prepared for the soaring flight the Hon.\nSam took now. He started with one finger pointed heavenward:\n\n   “The knights are dust\n    And their good swords are rast;\n    Their souls are with the saints, we trust.”\n\n“Scepticism is but a harmless phantom in these mighty hills. We BELIEVE\nthat with the saints is the GOOD knight's soul, and if, in the radiant\nunknown, the eyes of those who have gone before can pierce the little\nshadow that lies between, we know that the good knights of old look\ngladly down on these good knights of to-day. For it is good to be\nremembered. The tireless struggle for name and fame since the sunrise\nof history attests it; and the ancestry worship in the East and the\nworld-wide hope of immortality show the fierce hunger in the human soul\nthat the memory of it not only shall not perish from this earth, but\nthat, across the Great Divide, it shall live on--neither forgetting nor\nforgotten. You are here in memory of those good knights to prove that\nthe age of chivalry is not gone; that though their good swords are rust,\nthe stainless soul of them still illumines every harmless spear point\nbefore me and makes it a torch that shall reveal, in your own hearts\nstill aflame, their courage, their chivalry, their sense of protection\nfor the weak, and the honor in which they held pure women, brave men,\nand almighty God.\n\n“The tournament, some say, goes back to the walls of Troy. The form of\nit passed with the windmills that Don Quixote charged. It is with you to\nkeep the high spirit of it an ever-burning vestal fire. It was a deadly\nplay of old--it is a harmless play to you this day. But the prowess of\nthe game is unchanged; for the skill to strike those pendent rings is no\nless than was the skill to strike armor-joint, visor, or plumed crest.\nIt was of old an exercise for deadly combat on the field of battle; it\nis no less an exercise now to you for the field of life--for the quick\neye, the steady nerve, and the deft hand which shall help you strike the\nmark at which, outside these lists, you aim. And the crowning triumph\nis still just what it was of old--that to the victor the Rose of his\nworld--made by him the Queen of Love and Beauty for us all--shall give\nher smile and with her own hands place on his brow a thornless crown.”\n\nPerfect silence honored the Hon. Samuel Budd. The Mayor was nodding\nvigorous approval, the jeering ones kept still, and when after the last\ndeep-toned word passed like music from his lips the silence held sway\nfor a little while before the burst of applause came. Every knight had\nstraightened in his saddle and was looking very grave. Marston's eyes\nnever left the speaker's face, except once, when they turned with an\nunconscious appeal, I thought, to the downcast face of Blight--whereat\nthe sympathetic little sister seemed close to tears. The Knight of the\nCumberland shifted in his saddle as though he did not quite understand\nwhat was going on, and once Mollie, seeing the eyes through the\nmask-holes fixed on her, blushed furiously, and little Buck grinned back\na delighted recognition. The Hon. Sam sat down, visibly affected by his\nown eloquence; slowly he wiped his face and then he rose again.\n\n“Your colors, Sir Knights,” he said, with a commanding wave of his\ntruncheon, and one by one the knights spurred forward and each held\nhis lance into the grandstand that some fair one might tie thereon the\ncolors he was to wear. Marston, without looking at the Blight, held his\nup to the little sister and the Blight carelessly turned her face while\nthe demure sister was busy with her ribbons, but I noticed that the\nlittle ear next to me was tingling red for all her brave look of\nunconcern. Only the Knight of the Cumberland sat still.\n\n“What!” said the Hon. Sam, rising to his feet, his eyes twinkling and\nhis mask of humor on again; “sees this masked springal”--the Hon. Sam\nseemed much enamored of that ancient word--“no maid so fair that he\nwill not beg from her the boon of colors gay that he may carry them to\nvictory and receive from her hands a wreath therefor?” Again the Knight\nof the Cumberland seemed not to know that the Hon. Sam's winged words\nwere meant for him, so the statesman translated them into a mutual\nvernacular.\n\n“Remember what I told you, son,” he said. “Hold up yo' spear here to\nsome one of these gals jes' like the other fellows are doin',” and as he\nsat down he tried surreptitiously to indicate the Blight with his\nindex finger, but the knight failed to see and the Blight's face was\nso indignant and she rebuked him with such a knife-like whisper that,\nhumbled, the Hon. Sam collapsed in his seat, muttering:\n\n“The fool don't know you--he don't know you.”\n\nFor the Knight of the Cumberland had turned the black horse's head and\nwas riding, like Ivanhoe, in front of the nobles and ladies, his eyes\nburning up at them through the holes in his white mask. Again he turned,\nhis mask still uplifted, and the behavior of the beauties there, as on\nthe field of Ashby, was no whit changed: “Some blushed, some assumed an\nair of pride and dignity, some looked straight forward and essayed to\nseem utterly unconscious of what was going on, some drew back in alarm\nwhich was perhaps affected, some endeavored to forbear smiling and there\nwere two or three who laughed outright.” Only none “dropped a veil over\nher charms” and thus none incurred the suspicion, as on that field of\nAshby, that she was “a beauty of ten years' standing” whose motive,\ngallant Sir Walter supposes in defence, however, was doubtless “a\nsurfeit of such vanities and a willingness to give a fair chance to\nthe rising beauties of the age.” But the most conscious of the fair\nwas Mollie below, whose face was flushed and whose brown fingers were\nnervously twisting the ribbons in her lap, and I saw Buck nudge her and\nheard him whisper:\n\n“Dave ain't going to pick YOU out, I tell ye. I heered Mr. Budd thar\nmyself tell him he HAD to pick out some other gal.”\n\n“You hush!” said Mollie indignantly.\n\nIt looked as though the Knight of the Cumberland had grown rebellious\nand meant to choose whom he pleased, but on his way back the Hon.\nSam must have given more surreptitious signs, for the Knight of the\nCumberland reined in before the Blight and held up his lance to her.\nStraightway the colors that were meant for Marston fluttered from the\nKnight of the Cumberland's spear. I saw Marston bite his lips and I saw\nMollie's face aflame with fury and her eyes darting lightning--no\nlonger at Marston now, but at the Blight. The mountain girl held nothing\nagainst the city girl because of the Wild Dog's infatuation, but that\nher own lover, no matter what the Hon. Sam said, should give his homage\nalso to the Blight, in her own presence, was too much. Mollie looked\naround no more. Again the Hon. Sam rose.\n\n“Love of ladies,” he shouted, “splintering of lances! Stand forth,\ngallant knights. Fair eyes look upon your deeds! Toot again, son!”\n\nNow just opposite the grandstand was a post some ten feet high, with a\nsmall beam projecting from the top toward the spectators. From the end\nof this hung a wire, the end of which was slightly upturned in line with\nthe course, and on the tip of this wire a steel ring about an inch in\ndiameter hung lightly. Nearly forty yards below this was a similar\nring similarly arranged; and at a similar distance below that was\nstill another, and at the blast from the Hon. Sam's herald, the\ngallant knights rode slowly, two by two, down the lists to the western\nextremity--the Discarded Knight and the Knight of the Cumberland,\nstirrup to stirrup, riding last--where they all drew up in line, some\nfifty yards beyond the westernmost post. This distance they took that\nfull speed might be attained before jousting at the first ring, since\nthe course--much over one hundred yards long--must be covered in seven\nseconds or less, which was no slow rate of speed. The Hon. Sam arose\nagain:\n\n“The Knight of the Holston!”\n\nFarther down the lists a herald took up the same cry and the good knight\nof Athelstanic build backed his steed from the line and took his place\nat the head of the course.\n\nWith his hickory truncheon the Hon. Sam signed to his trumpeter to sound\nthe onset.\n\n“Now, son!” he said.\n\nWith the blare of the trumpet Athelstane sprang from his place and came\nup the course, his lance at rest; a tinkling sound and the first ring\nslipped down the knight's spear and when he swept past the last post\nthere was a clapping of hands, for he held three rings triumphantly\naloft. And thus they came, one by one, until each had run the course\nthree times, the Discarded jousting next to the last and the Knight of\nthe Cumberland, riding with a reckless Cave, Adsum air, the very last.\nAt the second joust it was quite evident that the victory lay between\nthese two, as they only had not lost a single ring, and when the black\nhorse thundered by, the Hon. Sam shouted “Brave lance!” and jollied\nhis betting enemies, while Buck hugged himself triumphantly and Mollie\nseemed temporarily to lose her chagrin and anger in pride of her lover,\nDave. On the third running the Knight of the Cumberland excited a\nsensation by sitting upright, waving his lance up and down between the\nposts and lowering it only when the ring was within a few feet of its\npoint. His recklessness cost him one ring, but as the Discarded had lost\none, they were still tied, with eight rings to the credit of each, for\nthe first prize. Only four others were left--the Knight of the Holston\nand the Knight of the Green Valley tying with seven rings for second\nprize, and the fat Maxwelton Braes and the Knight at Large tying with\nsix rings for the third. The crowd was eager now and the Hon. Sam\nconfident. On came the Knight at Large, his face a rainbow, his plume\nwilted and one red base-ball stocking slipped from its moorings--two\nrings! On followed the fat Maxwelton, his plaid streaming and his kilts\nflapping about his fat legs--also two rings!\n\n“Egad!” quoth the Hon. Sam. “Did yon lusty trencherman of Annie Laurie's\nbut put a few more layers of goodly flesh about his ribs, thereby\nprojecting more his frontal Falstaffian proportions, by my halidom, he\nwould have to joust tandem!”\n\nOn came Athelstane and the Knight of the Green Valley, both with but two\nrings to their credit, and on followed the Discarded, riding easily, and\nthe Knight of the Cumberland again waving his lance between the posts,\neach with three rings on his spear. At the end the Knight at Large\nstood third, Athelstane second, and the Discarded and the Knight of the\nCumberland stood side by side at the head of the course, still even, and\nnow ready to end the joust, for neither on the second trial had missed a\nring.\n\nThe excitement was intense now. Many people seemed to know who the\nKnight of the Cumberland was, for there were shouts of “Go it, Dave!”\n from everywhere; the rivalry of class had entered the contest and now\nit was a conflict between native and “furriner.” The Hon. Sam was almost\nbeside himself with excitement; now and then some man with whom he had\nmade a bet would shout jeeringly at him and the Hon. Sam would shout\nback defiance. But when the trumpet sounded he sat leaning forward with\nhis brow wrinkled and his big hands clinched tight. Marston sped up the\ncourse first--three rings--and there was a chorus of applauding yells.\n\n“His horse is gittin' tired,” said the Hon. Sam jubilantly, and the\nBlight's face, I noticed, showed for the first time faint traces of\nindignation. The Knight of the Cumberland was taking no theatrical\nchances now and he came through the course with level spear and, with\nthree rings on it, he shot by like a thunderbolt.\n\n“Hooray!” shouted the Hon. Sam. “Lord, what a horse!” For the first time\nthe Blight, I observed, failed to applaud, while Mollie was clapping her\nhands and Buck was giving out shrill yells of encouragement. At the\nnext tilt the Hon. Sam had his watch in his hand and when he saw the\nDiscarded digging in his spurs he began to smile and he was looking at\nhis watch when the little tinkle in front told him that the course was\nrun.\n\n“Did he get 'em all?”\n\n“Yes, he got 'em all,” mimicked the Blight.\n\n“Yes, an' he just did make it,” chuckled the Hon. Sam. The Discarded\nhad wheeled his horse aside from the course to watch his antagonist. He\nlooked pale and tired--almost as tired as his foam-covered steed--but\nhis teeth were set and his face was unmoved as the Knight of the\nCumberland came on like a demon, sweeping off the last ring with a low,\nrasping oath of satisfaction.\n\n“I never seed Dave ride that-a-way afore,” said Mollie.\n\n“Me, neither,” chimed in Buck.\n\nThe nobles and ladies were waving handkerchiefs, clapping hands, and\nshouting. The spectators of better degree were throwing up their\nhats and from every part of the multitude the same hoarse shout of\nencouragement rose:\n\n“Go it, Dave! Hooray for Dave!” while the boy on the telegraph-pole was\nseen to clutch wildly at the crossbar on which he sat--he had come near\ntumbling from his perch.\n\nThe two knights rode slowly back to the head of the lists, where the\nDiscarded was seen to dismount and tighten his girth.\n\n“He's tryin' to git time to rest,” said the Hon. Sam. “Toot, son!”\n\n“Shame!” said the little sister and the Blight both at once so severely\nthat the Hon. Sam quickly raised his hand.\n\n“Hold on,” he said, and with hand still uplifted he waited till Marston\nwas mounted again. “Now!”\n\nThe Discarded came on, using his spurs with every jump, the red of his\nhorse's nostrils showing that far away, and he swept on, spearing off\nthe rings with deadly accuracy and holding the three aloft, but having\nno need to pull in his panting steed, who stopped of his own accord.\nUp went a roar, but the Hon. Sam, covertly glancing at his watch, still\nsmiled. That watch he pulled out when the Knight of the Cumberland\nstarted and he smiled still when he heard the black horse's swift,\nrhythmic beat and he looked up only when that knight, shouting to his\nhorse, moved his lance up and down before coming to the last ring and,\nwith a dare-devil yell, swept it from the wire.\n\n“Tied--tied!” was the shout; “they've got to try it again! they've got\nto try it again!”\n\nThe Hon. Sam rose, with his watch in one hand and stilling the tumult\nwith the other. Dead silence came at once.\n\n“I fear me,” he said, “that the good knight, the Discarded, has failed\nto make the course in the time required by the laws of the tournament.”\n Bedlam broke loose again and the Hon. Sam waited, still gesturing for\nsilence.\n\n“Summon the time-keeper!” he said.\n\nThe time-keeper appeared from the middle of the field and nodded.\n\n“Eight seconds!” “The Knight of the Cumberland wins,” said the Hon. Sam.\n\nThe little sister, unconscious of her own sad face, nudged me to look at\nthe Blight--there were tears in her eyes.\n\n\nBefore the grandstand the knights slowly drew up again. Marston's horse\nwas so lame and tired that he dismounted and let a darky boy lead him\nunder the shade of the trees. But he stood on foot among the other\nknights, his arms folded, worn out and vanquished, but taking his bitter\nmedicine like a man. I thought the Blight's eyes looked pityingly upon\nhim.\n\nThe Hon. Sam arose with a crown of laurel leaves in his hand:\n\n“You have fairly and gallantly won, Sir Knight of the Cumberland, and\nit is now your right to claim and receive from the hands of the Queen\nof Love and Beauty the chaplet of honor which your skill has justly\ndeserved. Advance, Sir Knight of the Cumberland, and dismount!”\n\nThe Knight of the Cumberland made no move nor sound.\n\n“Get off yo' hoss, son,” said the Hon. Sam kindly, “and get down on yo'\nknees at the feet of them steps. This fair young Queen is a-goin' to put\nthis chaplet on your shinin' brow. That horse'll stand.”\n\nThe Knight of the Cumberland, after a moment's hesitation, threw his leg\nover the saddle and came to the steps with a slouching gait and looking\nabout him right and left. The Blight, blushing prettily, took the\nchaplet and went down the steps to meet him.\n\n“Unmask!” I shouted.\n\n“Yes, son,” said the Hon. Sam, “take that rag off.”\n\nThen Mollie's voice, clear and loud, startled the crowd. “You better\nnot, Dave Branham, fer if you do and this other gal puts that thing\non you, you'll never--” What penalty she was going to inflict, I don't\nknow, for the Knight of the Cumberland, half kneeling, sprang suddenly\nto his feet and interrupted her. “Wait a minute, will ye?” he said\nalmost fiercely, and at the sound of his voice Mollie rose to her feet\nand her face blanched.\n\n“Lord God!” she said almost in anguish, and then she dropped quickly to\nher seat again.\n\nThe Knight of the Cumberland had gone back to his horse as though to get\nsomething from his saddle. Like lightning he vaulted into the saddle,\nand as the black horse sprang toward the opening tore his mask from his\nface, turned in his stirrups, and brandished his spear with a yell of\ndefiance, while a dozen voices shouted:\n\n“The Wild Dog!” Then was there an uproar.\n\n“Goddle mighty!” shouted the Hon. Sam. “I didn't do it, I swear I didn't\nknow it. He's tricked me--he's tricked me! Don't shoot--you might hit\nthat hoss!”\n\nThere was no doubt about the Hon. Sam's innocence. Instead of turning\nover an outlaw to the police, he had brought him into the inner shrine\nof law and order and he knew what a political asset for his enemies that\ninsult would be. And there was no doubt of the innocence of Mollie and\nBuck as they stood, Mollie wringing her hands and Buck with open mouth\nand startled face. There was no doubt about the innocence of anybody\nother than Dave Branham and the dare-devil Knight of the Cumberland.\n\nMarston had clutched at the Wild Dog's bridle and missed and the outlaw\nstruck savagely at him with his spear. Nobody dared to shoot because of\nthe scattering crowd, but every knight and every mounted policeman took\nout after the outlaw and the beating of hoofs pounded over the little\nmound and toward Poplar Hill. Marston ran to his horse at the upper end,\nthrew his saddle on, and hesitated--there were enough after the Wild\nDog and his horse was blown. He listened to the yells and sounds of the\nchase encircling Poplar Hill. The outlaw was making for Lee. All at once\nthe yells and hoof-beats seemed to sound nearer and Marston listened,\nastonished. The Wild Dog had wheeled and was coming back; he was going\nto make for the Gap, where sure safety lay. Marston buckled his girth\nand as he sprang on his horse, unconsciously taking his spear with\nhim, the Wild Dog dashed from the trees at the far end of the field. As\nMarston started the Wild Dog saw him, pulled something that flashed from\nunder his coat of mail, thrust it back again, and brandishing his spear,\nhe came, full speed and yelling, up the middle of the field. It was a\nstrange thing to happen in these modern days, but Marston was an officer\nof the law and was between the Wild Dog and the Ford and liberty through\nthe Gap, into the hills. The Wild Dog was an outlaw. It was Marston's\nduty to take him.\n\nThe law does not prescribe with what weapon the lawless shall be\nsubdued, and Marston's spear was the only weapon he had. Moreover, the\nWild Dog's yell was a challenge that set his blood afire and the\ngirl both loved was looking on. The crowd gathered the meaning of the\njoust--the knights were crashing toward each other with spears at rest.\nThere were a few surprised oaths from men, a few low cries from women,\nand then dead silence in which the sound of hoofs on the hard turf was\nlike thunder. The Blight's face was white and the little sister was\ngripping my arm with both hands. A third horseman shot into view out of\nthe woods at tight angles, to stop them, and it seemed that the three\nhorses must crash together in a heap. With a moan the Blight buried her\nface on my shoulder. She shivered when the muffled thud of body against\nbody and the splintering of wood rent the air; a chorus of shrieks\narose about her, and when she lifted her frightened face Marston, the\nDiscarded, was limp on the ground, his horse was staggering to his feet,\nand the Wild Dog was galloping past her, his helmet gleaming, his eyes\nablaze, his teeth set, the handle of his broken spear clinched in his\nright hand, and blood streaming down the shoulder of the black horse.\nShe heard the shots that were sent after him, she heard him plunge into\nthe river, and then she saw and heard no more.\n\n\n\n\nVIII. THE KNIGHT PASSES\n\nA telegram summoned the Blight a home next day. Marston was in bed with\na ragged wound in the shoulder, and I took her to tell him good-by. I\nleft the room for a few minutes, and when I came back their hands were\nunclasping, and for a Discarded Knight the engineer surely wore a happy\nthough pallid face.\n\nThat afternoon the train on which we left the Gap was brought to a\nsudden halt in Wildcat Valley by a piece of red flannel tied to the end\nof a stick that was planted midway the track. Across the track, farther\non, lay a heavy piece of timber, and it was plain that somebody meant\nthat, just at that place, the train must stop. The Blight and I were\nseated on the rear platform and the Blight was taking a last look at\nher beloved hills. When the train started again, there was a cracking of\ntwigs overhead and a shower of rhododendron leaves and flowers dropped\nfrom the air at the feet of the Blight. And when we pulled away from the\nhigh-walled cut we saw, motionless on a little mound, a black horse, and\non him, motionless, the Knight of the Cumberland, the helmet on his\nhead (that the Blight might know who he was, no doubt), and both hands\nclasping the broken handle of his spear, which rested across the pommel\nof his saddle. Impulsively the Blight waved her hand to him and I could\nnot help waving my hat; but he sat like a statue and, like a statue,\nsat on, simply looking after us as we were hurried along, until horse,\nbroken shaft, and shoulders sank out of sight. And thus passed the\nKnight of the Cumberland with the last gleam that struck his helmet,\nspear-like, from the slanting sun.",
