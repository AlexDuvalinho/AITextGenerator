 "text": "THE MARKET-PLACE\n\nby Harold Frederic\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nTHE battle was over, and the victor remained on the field--sitting alone\nwith the hurly-burly of his thoughts.\n\nHis triumph was so sweeping and comprehensive as to be somewhat\nshapeless to the view. He had a sense of fascinated pain when he tried\nto define to himself what its limits would probably be. Vistas of\nunchecked, expanding conquest stretched away in every direction. He held\nat his mercy everything within sight. Indeed, it rested entirely with\nhim to say whether there should be any such thing as mercy at all--and\nuntil he chose to utter the restraining word the rout of the vanquished\nwould go on with multiplying terrors and ruin. He could crush and\ntorture and despoil his enemies until he was tired. The responsibility\nof having to decide when he would stop grinding their faces might come\nto weigh upon him later on, but he would not give it room in his mind\nto-night.\n\nA picture of these faces of his victims shaped itself out of the flames\nin the grate. They were moulded in a family likeness, these phantom\nvisages: they were all Jewish, all malignant, all distorted with fright.\nThey implored him with eyes in which panic asserted itself above rage\nand cunning. Only here and there did he recall a name with which to\nlabel one of these countenances; very few of them raised a memory of\nindividual rancour. The faces were those of men he had seen, no doubt,\nbut their persecution of him had been impersonal; his great revenge was\nequally so. As he looked, in truth, there was only one face--a composite\nmask of what he had done battle with, and overthrown, and would trample\nimplacably under foot. He stared with a conqueror's cold frown at it,\nand gave an abrupt laugh which started harsh echoes in the stillness of\nthe Board Room. Then he shook off the reverie, and got to his feet. He\nshivered a little at the sudden touch of a chill.\n\nA bottle of brandy, surrounded by glasses, stood on the table where the\ntwo least-considered of his lieutenants, the dummy Directors, had left\nit. He poured a small quantity and sipped it. During the whole eventful\nday it had not occurred to him before to drink; the taste of the neat\nliquor seemed on the instant to calm and refresh his brain. With more\ndeliberation, he took a cigar from the broad, floridly-decorated\nopen box beside the bottle, lit it, and blew a long draught of smoke\nthoughtfully through his nostrils. Then he put his hands in his pockets,\nlooked again into the fire, and sighed a wondering smile. God in heaven!\nit was actually true!\n\nThis man of forty found himself fluttering with a novel exhilaration,\nwhich yet was not novel. Upon reflection, he perceived that he felt as\nif he were a boy again--a boy excited by pleasure. It surprised as much\nas it delighted him to experience this frank and direct joy of a\nchild. He caught the inkling of an idea that perhaps his years were an\nillusion. He had latterly been thinking of himself as middle-aged; the\ngrey hairs thickening at his temples had vaguely depressed him. Now all\nat once he saw that he was not old at all. The buoyancy of veritable\nyouth bubbled in his veins. He began walking up and down the room,\nregarding new halcyon visions with a sparkling eye. He was no longer\nconscious of the hated foe beneath his feet; they trod instead elastic\nupon the clouds.\n\nThe sound of someone moving about in the hallway outside, and of trying\na door near by, suddenly caught his attention. He stood still and\nlistened with alertness for a surprised instant, then shrugged his\nshoulders and began moving again. It must be nearly seven o'clock;\nalthough the allotment work had kept the clerks later than usual that\nday, everybody connected with the offices had certainly gone home. He\nrealized that his nerves had played him a trick in giving that alarmed\nmomentary start--and smiled almost tenderly as he remembered how notable\nand even glorious a warrant those nerves had for their unsettled state.\nThey would be all right after a night's real rest. He would know how to\nsleep NOW, thank God!\n\nBut yes--there was somebody outside--and this time knocking with\nassurance at the right door, the entrance to the outer office. After a\nsecond's consideration, he went into this unlighted outer office, and\ncalled out through the opaque glass an enquiry. The sound of his voice,\nas it analyzed itself in his own ears, seemed unduly peremptory. The\nanswer which came back brought a flash of wonderment to his eyes. He\nhurriedly unlocked and opened the door.\n\n“I saw the lights in what I made out to be the Board Room,” said\nthe newcomer, as he entered. “I assumed it must be you. Hope I don't\ninterrupt anything.”\n\n“Nothing could have given me greater pleasure, Lord Plowden,” replied\nthe other, leading the way back to the inner apartment. “In fact, I\ncouldn't have asked anything better.”\n\nThe tone of his voice had a certain anxious note in it not quite\nin harmony with this declaration. He turned, under the drop-light\noverhanging the Board-table, and shook hands with his guest, as if to\natone for this doubtful accent. “I shake hands with you again,” he\nsaid, speaking rapidly, “because this afternoon it was what you may call\nformal; it didn't count. And--my God!--you're the man I owe it all to.”\n\n“Oh, you mustn't go as far as that--even in the absence of witnesses,”\n replied Lord Plowden, lightly. “I'll take off my coat for a few\nminutes,” he went on, very much at his ease. “It's hot in here. It's by\nthe merest chance I happened to be detained in the City--and I saw your\nlights, and this afternoon we had no opportunity whatever for a quiet\ntalk. No--I won't drink anything before dinner, but I'll light a cigar.\nI want to say to you, Thorpe,” he concluded, as he seated himself\n“that I think what you've done is very wonderful. The Marquis thinks so\ntoo--but I shouldn't like to swear that he understands much about it.”\n\nThe implication that the speaker did understand remained in the air\nlike a tangible object. Thorpe took a chair, and the two men exchanged a\nsilent, intent look. Their faces, dusky red on the side of the glow from\nthe fire, pallid where the electric light fell slantwise upon them\nfrom above, had for a moment a mysterious something in common. Then\nthe tension of the glance was relaxed--and on the instant no two men in\nLondon looked less alike.\n\nLord Plowden was familiarly spoken of as a handsome man. Thorpe had even\nheard him called the handsomest man in England--though this seemed in\nall likelihood an exaggeration. But handsome he undoubtedly was--tall\nwithout suggesting the thought of height to the observer, erect yet\ngraceful, powerfully built, while preserving the effect of\nslenderness. His face in repose had the outline of the more youthful\nguardsman-type--regular, finely-cut, impassive to hardness. When he\ntalked, or followed with interest the talk of others, it revealed almost\nan excess of animation. Then one noted the flashing subtlety of his\nglance, the swift facility of his smile and comprehending brows, and saw\nthat it was not the guardsman face at all. His skin was fresh-hued, and\nthere was a shade of warm brown in his small, well-ordered moustasche,\nbut his hair, wavy and worn longer than the fashion, seemed black. There\nwere perceptible veins of grey in it, though he had only entered his\nthirty-fifth year. He was dressed habitually with the utmost possible\ncare.\n\nThe contrast between this personage and the older man confronting him\nwas abrupt. Thorpe was also tall, but of a burly and slouching figure.\nHis face, shrouded in a high-growing, dust-coloured beard, invited no\nattention. One seemed always to have known this face--thick-featured,\nimmobile, undistinguished. Its accessories for the time being were even\nmore than ordinarily unimpressive. Both hair and beard were ragged with\nneglect. His commonplace, dark clothes looked as if he had slept in\nthem. The hands resting on his big knees were coarse in shape, and\nroughened, and ill-kept.\n\n“I couldn't have asked anything better than your dropping in,” he\nrepeated now, speaking with a drag, as of caution, on his words.\n“Witnesses or no witnesses, I'm anxious to have you understand that I\nrealize what I owe to you.”\n\n“I only wish it were a great deal more than it is,” replied the other,\nwith a frank smile.\n\n“Oh, it'll mount up to considerable, as it stands,” said Thorpe.\n\nHe could hear that there was a kind of reservation in his voice; the\nsuspicion that his companion detected it embarrassed him. He found\nhimself in the position of fencing with a man to whom all his feelings\nimpelled him to be perfectly open. He paused, and was awkwardly\nconscious of constraint in the silence which ensued. “You are very kind\nto put it in that way,” said Lord Plowden, at last. He seemed also to be\nfinding words for his thoughts with a certain difficulty. He turned\nhis cigar round in his white fingers meditatively. “I gather that\nyour success has been complete--as complete as you yourself could have\ndesired. I congratulate you with all my heart.”\n\n“No--don't say my success--say our success,” put in Thorpe.\n\n“But, my dear man,” the other corrected him, “my interest, compared with\nyours, is hardly more than nominal. I'm a Director, of course, and I'm\nnot displeased that my few shares should be worth something instead of\nnothing, but----”\n\nThorpe lifted one of his heavy hands. “That isn't my view of the thing\nat all. To be frank, I was turning over in my mind, just awhile ago,\nbefore you came in, some way of arranging all that on a different\nfooting. If you'll trust it to me, I think you'll find it's all right.”\n\nSomething in the form of this remark seemed to restore to Lord Plowden\nhis accustomed fluency of speech.\n\n“I came here to say precisely that thing,” he began--“that I do trust\nit to you. We have never had any very definite talk on the subject--and\npray don't think that I want to go into details now. I'd much rather\nnot, in fact. But what I do want to say to you is this: I believe in\nyou. I feel sure that you are going to go far, as the saying is. Well,\nI want to tie myself to your star. Do you see what I mean? You are going\nto be a power in finance. You are going to be able to make and unmake\nmen as you choose. I should be very much obliged indeed if you would\nmake me.”\n\nThorpe regarded the handsome and titled man of fashion with what seemed\nto the other a lethargic gaze. In truth, his mind was toiling with\nstrenuous activity to master, in all its bearings, the significance of\nwhat had been said. This habit of the abstracted and lack-lustre eye,\nthe while he was hard at work thinking, was a fortuitous asset which he\nhad never up to that time learned that he possessed. Unconsciously, he\ndampened the spirits of his companion.\n\n“Don't imagine I'm trying to force myself upon you,” Lord Plowden said,\ngrowing cool in the face of this slow stare. “I'm asking nothing at all.\nI had the impulse to come and say to you that you are a great man, and\nthat you've done a great thing--and done it, moreover, in a very great\nway.”\n\n“You know how it was done!” The wondering exclamation forced itself from\nThorpe's unready lips. He bent forward a little, and took a new visual\nhold, as it were, of his companion's countenance.\n\nLord Plowden smiled. “Did you think I was such a hopeless duffer, then?”\n he rejoined.\n\nFor answer, Thorpe leant back in his chair, crossed his legs, and patted\nhis knee contentedly. All at once his face had lightened; a genial\nspeculation returned to his grey eyes.\n\n“Well, I was in a curious position about you, you see,” he began to\nexplain. The relief with which he spoke was palpable. “I could not for\nthe life of me make up my mind whether to tell you about it or not.\nLet's see--this is Thursday; did I see you Tuesday? At any rate, the\nscheme didn't dawn on me myself until toward evening Tuesday.\nBut yesterday, of course, I could have told you--and again this\nafternoon--but, as I say, I couldn't make up my mind. Once I had it on\nthe tip of my tongue--but somehow I didn't. And you--you never gave me a\nhint that you saw what was going on.”\n\nAgain Lord Plowden smiled. “I voted with you,” he put in softly.\n\nThorpe laughed, and relit his cigar. “Well, I couldn't have asked\nanything better than this,” he declared once again. “It beats all the\nrest put together, to my mind.”\n\n“Perhaps I don't quite follow your meaning,” commented the other\ntentatively.\n\n“Why man,” Thorpe explained, hesitating a little in his choice of words,\nbut speaking with evident fervour; “I was more anxious about you--and\nthe way you'd take it--than about anything else. I give you my word I\nwas. I couldn't tell at all how you'd feel about the thing. You might\nthink that it was all right, and then again you might round on me--or\nno, I don't mean quite that--but you might say it wasn't good enough for\nyou, and wash your hands of the whole affair. And I can't tell you what\na relief it is to find that you--that you're satisfied. Now I can go\nahead.”\n\n“Ah, yes--ahead,” said the younger man, thoughtfully. “Do you mind\ntelling me--you see I'm quite in the dark as to details--how much\nfurther ahead we are likely to go? I comprehend the general nature of\nour advance--but how far off is the goal you have in sight?”\n\n“God knows!” answered Thorpe, with a rising thrill of excitement in his\nvoice. “I don't give it any limit. I don't see why we should stop at\nall. We've got them in such a position that--why, good heavens! we can\nsqueeze them to death, crush them like quartz.” He chuckled grimly at\nthe suggestion of his simile. “We'll get more ounces to the ton out of\nour crushings than they ever heard of on the Rand, too.”\n\n“Might I ask,” interposed the other, “who may 'they' be?”\n\nThorpe hesitated, and knitted his brows in the effort to remember names.\n“Oh, there are a lot of them,” he said, vaguely. “I think I told you\nof the way that Kaffir crowd pretended to think well of me, and let me\nbelieve they were going to take me up, and then, because I wouldn't give\nthem everything--the very shirt off my back--turned and put their knife\ninto me. I don't know them apart, hardly--they've all got names like\nRhine wines--but I know the gang as a whole, and if I don't lift the\nroof clean off their particular synagogue, then my name is mud.”\n\nLord Plowden smiled. “I've always the greatest difficulty to remember\nthat you are an Englishman--a Londoner born,” he declared pleasantly.\n“You don't talk in the least like one. On shipboard I made sure you\nwere an American--a very characteristic one, I thought--of some curious\nWestern variety, you know. I never was more surprised in my life than\nwhen you told me, the other day, that you only left England a few years\nago.”\n\n“Oh, hardly a 'few years'; more like fifteen,” Thorpe corrected him. He\nstudied his companion's face with slow deliberation.\n\n“I'm going to say something that you mustn't take amiss,” he remarked,\nafter a little pause. “If you'd known that I was an Englishman, when\nwe first met, there on the steamer, I kind o' suspect that you and I'd\nnever have got much beyond a nodding acquaintance--and even that mostly\non my side. I don't mean that I intended to conceal anything--that is,\nnot specially--but I've often thought since that it was a mighty good\nthing I did. Now isn't that true--that if you had taken me for one of\nyour own countrymen you'd have given me the cold shoulder?”\n\n“I dare say there's a good deal in what you say,” the other admitted,\ngently enough, but without contrition. “Things naturally shape\nthemselves that way, rather, you know. If they didn't, why then the\nwhole position would become difficult. But you are an American, to all\nintents and purposes.”\n\n“Oh, no--I never took any step towards getting naturalized,” Thorpe\nprotested. “I always intended to come back here. Or no, I won't say\nthat--because most of the time I was dog-poor--and this isn't the place\nfor a poor man. But I always said to myself that if ever I pulled it\noff--if I ever found my self a rich man--THEN I'd come piking across the\nAtlantic as fast as triple-expansion engines would carry me.”\n\nThe young man smiled again, with a whimsical gleam in his eye. “And you\nARE a rich man, now,” he observed, after a momentary pause.\n\n“We are both rich men,” replied Thorpe, gravely.\n\nHe held up a dissuading hand, as the other would have spoken. “This is\nhow it seems to me the thing figures itself out: It can't be said that\nyour name on the Board, or the Marquis's either, was of much use so far\nas the public were concerned. To tell the truth, I saw some time ago\nthat they wouldn't be. Titles on prospectuses are played out in London.\nI've rather a notion, indeed, that they're apt to do more harm than\ngood--just at present, at least. But all that aside--you are the man who\nwas civil to me at the start, when you knew nothing whatever about my\nscheme, and you are the man who was good to me later on, when I didn't\nknow where to turn for a friendly word. Very well; here I am! I've made\nmy coup! And I'd be a sweep, wouldn't I? to forget to-day what I was so\nglad to remember a week ago. But you see, I don't forget! The capital\nof the Company is 500,000 pounds, all in pound shares. We offered the\npublic only a fifth of them. The other four hundred thousand shares are\nmine as vendor--and I have ear-marked in my mind one hundred thousand of\nthem to be yours.”\n\nLord Plowden's face paled at the significance of these words. “It is\ntoo much--you don't reflect what it is you are saying,” he murmured\nconfusedly. “Not a bit of it,” the other reassured him. “Everything that\nI've said goes.”\n\nThe peer, trembling a little, rose to his feet. “It is a preposterously\nbig reward for the merest act of courtesy,” he insisted. “Of course it\ntakes my breath away for joy--and yet I feel I oughtn't to be consenting\nto it at all. And it has its unpleasant side--it buries me under a\nmountain of obligation. I don't know what to do or what to say.”\n\n“Well, leave the saying and doing to me, then,” replied Thorpe, with a\ngesture before which the other resumed his seat. “Just a word more--and\nthen I suppose we'd better be going. Look at it in this way. Your\ngrandfather was Lord Chancellor of England, and your father was\na General in the Crimea. My grandfather kept a small second-hand\nbook-shop, and my father followed him in the business. In one sense,\nthat puts us ten thousand miles apart. But in another sense, we'll say\nthat we like each other, and that there are ways in which we can be of\nimmense use to each other, and that brings us close together. You need\nmoney--and here it is for you. I need--what shall I say?--a kind of\nfriendly lead in the matter of establishing myself on the right footing,\namong the right people--and that's what you can do for me. Mind--I'd\nprefer to put it all in quite another way; I'd like to say it was\nall niceness on your part, all gratitude on mine. But if you want to\nconsider it on a business basis--why there you have it also--perfectly\nplain and clear.”\n\nHe got up as he finished, and Lord Plowden rose as well. The two men\nshook hands in silence.\n\nWhen the latter spoke, it was to say: “Do you know how to open one of\nthose soda-water bottles? I've tried, but I can never get the trick. I\nthink I should like to have a drink--after this.”\n\nWhen they had put down their glasses, and the younger man was getting\ninto his great-coat, Thorpe bestowed the brandy and cigars within a\ncabinet at the corner of the room, and carefully turned a key upon them.\n\n“If you're going West, let me give you a lift,” said Lord Plowden, hat\nin hand. “I can set you down wherever you like. Unfortunately I've to go\nout to dinner, and I must race, as it is, to get dressed.”\n\nThorpe shook his head. “No, go along,” he bade him. “I've some odds and\nends of things to do on the way.”\n\n“Then when shall I see you?”--began the other, and halted suddenly\nwith a new thought in his glance. “But what are you doing Saturday?”\n he asked, in a brisker tone. “It's a dies non here. Come down with me\nto-morrow evening, to my place in Kent. We will shoot on Saturday,\nand drive about on Sunday, if you like--and there we can talk at our\nleisure. Yes, that is what you must do. I have a gun for you. Shall we\nsay, then--Charing Cross at 9:55? Or better still, say 5:15, and we will\ndine at home.”\n\nThe elder man pondered his answer--frowning at the problem before him\nwith visible anxiety. “I'm afraid I'd better not come--it's very good of\nyou all the same.”\n\n“Nonsense,” retorted the other. “My mother will be very glad indeed to\nsee you. There is no one else there--unless, perhaps, my sister has some\nfriend down. We shall make a purely family party.”\n\nThorpe hesitated for only a further second. “All right. Charing Cross,\n5:15,” he said then, with the grave brevity of one who announces a\nmomentous decision.\n\nHe stood still, looking into the fire, for a few moments after his\ncompanion had gone. Then, going to a closet at the end of the room, he\nbrought forth his coat and hat; something prompted him to hold them up,\nand scrutinize them under the bright light of the electric globe. He put\nthem on, then, with a smile, half-scornful, half-amused, playing in his\nbeard.\n\nThe touch of a button precipitated darkness upon the Board Room. He made\nhis way out, and downstairs to the street. It was a rainy, windy October\nnight, sloppy underfoot, dripping overhead. At the corner before him, a\ncabman, motionless under his unshapely covered hat and glistening rubber\ncape, sat perched aloft on his seat, apparently asleep. Thorpe hailed\nhim, with a peremptory tone, and gave the brusque order, “Strand!” as he\nclambered into the hansom.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\n“LOUISA, the long and short of it is this,” said Thorpe, half an hour\nlater: “you never did believe in me, as a sister should do.”\n\nHe was seated alone with this sister, in a small, low, rather\ndismally-appointed room, half-heartedly lighted by two flickering\ngasjets. They sat somewhat apart, confronting a fireplace, where only\nthe laid materials for a fire disclosed themselves in the cold grate.\nAbove the mantel hung an enlarged photograph of a scowling old man.\nThorpe's gaze recurred automatically at brief intervals to this\nportrait--which somehow produced the effect upon him of responsibility\nfor the cheerlessness of the room. There were other pictures on the\nwalls of which he was dimly conscious--small, faded, old prints about\nDido and AEneas and Agamemnon, which seemed to be coming back to him out\nof the mists of his childhood.\n\nVagrant impressions and associations of this childhood strayed with\nquaint inconsequence across the field of his preoccupied mind. The\npeculiar odour of the ancient book-shop on the floor below remained like\nsnuff in his nostrils. Somewhere underneath, or in the wainscoting at\nthe side, he could hear the assiduous gnawing of a rat. Was it the same\nrat, he wondered with a mental grin, that used to keep him awake nights,\nin one of the rooms next to this, with that same foolish noise, when he\nwas a boy?\n\n“I know you always say that,” replied Louisa, impassively.\n\nShe was years older than her brother, but, without a trace of artifice\nor intention, contrived to look the younger of the two. Her thick hair,\ndrawn simply from her temples into a knot behind, was of that palest\nbrown which assimilates grey. Her face, long, plain, masculine in\ncontour and spirit, conveyed no message as to years. Long and spare of\nfigure, she sat upright in her straight-backed chair, with her large,\ncapable hands on her knees.\n\n“I believed in you as much as you'd let me,” she went on, indifferently,\nalmost wearily. “But I don't see that it mattered to you whether I did\nor didn't. You went your own way: you did what you wanted to do. What\nhad I to do with it? I don't suppose I even knew what part of the world\nyou were in more than once in two or three years. How should I know\nwhether you were going to succeed, when I didn't even know what it\nwas you were at? Certainly you hadn't succeeded here in London--but\nelsewhere you might or you might not--how could I tell? And moreover, I\ndon't feel that I know you very well; you've grown into something very\ndifferent from the boy Joel that left the shop--it must be twenty years\nago. I can only know about you and your affairs what you tell me.”\n\n“But my point is,” pursued Thorpe, watching her face with a curiously\nintent glance, “you never said to yourself: 'I KNOW he's going to\nsucceed. I KNOW he'll be a rich man before he dies.'”\n\nShe shook her head dispassionately. Her manner expressed fatigued\nfailure to comprehend why he was making so much of this purposeless\npoint.\n\n“No--I don't remember ever having said that to myself,” she admitted,\nlistlessly. Then a comment upon his words occurred to her, and she spoke\nwith more animation: “You don't seem to understand, Joel, that what was\nvery important to you, didn't occupy me at all. You were always talking\nabout getting rich; you kept the idea before you of sometime, at a\nstroke, finding yourself a millionaire. That's been the idea of your\nlife. But what do I know about all that? My work has been to keep a roof\nover my head--to keep the little business from disappearing altogether.\nIt's been hard enough, I can tell you, these last few years, with the\nbig jobbers cutting the hearts out of the small traders. I had the\ninvalid husband to support for between three and four years--a dead\nweight on me every week--and then the children to look after, to clothe\nand educate.”\n\nAt the last word she hesitated suddenly, and looked at him. “Don't think\nI'm ungrateful”--she went on, with a troubled effort at a smile--“but I\nalmost wish you'd never sent me that four hundred pounds at all. What\nit means is that they've had two years at schools where now I shan't\nbe able to keep them any longer. They'll be spoiled for my kind of\nlife--and they won't have a fair chance for any other. I don't know what\nwill become of them.”\n\nThe profound apprehension in the mother's voice did not dull the gleam\nin Thorpe's eyes. He even began a smile in the shadows of his unkempt\nmoustache.\n\n“But when I sent that money, for example, two years ago, and over,” he\npersisted, doggedly--“and I told you there'd be more where that came\nfrom, and that I stood to pull off the great event--even then, now, you\ndidn't believe in your innermost heart that I knew what I was talking\nabout, did you?”\n\nShe frowned with impatience as she turned toward him. “For heaven's\nsake, Joel,” she said, sharply--“you become a bore with that stupid\nnonsense. I want to be patient with you--I do indeed sympathize with you\nin your misfortunes--you know that well enough--but you're very tiresome\nwith that eternal harping on what I believed and what I didn't believe.\nNow, are you going to stop to supper or not?--because if you are I must\nsend the maid out. And there's another thing--would it be of any help to\nyou to bring your things here from the hotel? You can have Alfred's room\nas well as not--till Christmas, at least.”\n\n“Supposing I couldn't get my luggage out of the hotel till I'd settled\nmy bill,” suggested Thorpe tentatively, in a muffled voice.\n\nThe practical woman reflected for an instant. “I was thinking,” she\nconfessed then, “that it might be cheaper to leave your things there,\nand buy what little you want--I don't imagine, from what I've seen, that\nyour wardrobe is so very valuable--but no, I suppose the bill ought to\nbe paid. Perhaps it can be managed; how much will it be?”\n\nThorpe musingly rose to his feet, and strolled over to her chair. With\nhis thick hands on his sister's shoulders he stooped and kissed her on\nthe forehead.\n\n“You believe in me now, anyway, eh, Lou?” he said, as he straightened\nhimself behind her.\n\nThe unaccustomed caress--so different in character from the perfunctory\nsalute with which he had greeted her on his arrival from foreign parts,\nsix months before--brought a flush of pleased surprise to her plain\nface. Then a kind of bewilderment crept into the abstracted gaze she was\nbending upon the fireless grate. Something extraordinary, unaccountable,\nwas in the manner of her brother. She recalled that, in truth, he was\nmore than half a stranger to her. How could she tell what wild,\nuncanny second nature had not grown up in him under those\noutlandish tropical skies? He had just told her that his ruin was\nabsolute--overwhelming--yet there had been a covert smile in the\nrecesses of his glance. Even now, she half felt, half heard, a chuckle\nfrom him, there as he stood behind her!\n\nThe swift thought that disaster had shaken his brain loomed up and\npossessed her. She flung herself out of the chair, and, wheeling, seized\nits back and drew it between them as she faced him. It was with a stare\nof frank dismay that she beheld him grinning at her.\n\n“What”--she began, stammering--“What is the matter, Joel?”\n\nHe permitted himself the luxury of smiling blankly at her for a further\nmoment. Then he tossed his head, and laughed abruptly.\n\n“Sit down, old girl,” he adjured her. “Try and hold yourself together,\nnow--to hear some different kind of news. I've been playing it rather\nlow down on you, for a fact. Instead of my being smashed, it's the other\nway about.”\n\nShe continued to confront him, with a nervous clasp upon the chair-back.\nHer breathing troubled her as she regarded him, and tried to take in the\nmeaning of his words.\n\n“Do you mean--you've been lying to me about--about your Company?” she\nasked, confusedly.\n\n“No--no--not at all,” he replied, now all genial heartiness. “No--what\nI told you was gospel truth--but I was taking a rise out of you all the\nsame.” He seemed so unaffectedly pleased by his achievement in kindly\nduplicity that she forced an awkward smile to her lips.\n\n“I don't understand in the least,” she said, striving to remember what\nhe had told her. “What you said was that the public had entirely failed\nto come in--that there weren't enough applications for shares to pay\nflotation expenses--those were your own words. Of course, I don't\npretend to understand these City matters--but it IS the case, isn't it,\nthat if people don't subscribe for the shares of a new company, then the\ncompany is a failure?”\n\n“Yes, that may be said to be the case--as a general rule,” he nodded at\nher, still beaming.\n\n“Well, then--of course--I don't understand,” she owned.\n\n“I don't know as you'll understand it much more when I've explained it\nto you,” he said, seating himself, and motioning her to the other chair.\n“But yes, of course you will. You're a business woman. You know what\nfigures mean. And really the whole thing is as simple as A B C. You\nremember that I told you----”\n\n“But are you going to stop to supper? I must send Annie out before the\nshops close.”\n\n“Supper? No--I couldn't eat anything. I'm too worked up for that. I'll\nget something at the hotel before I go to bed, if I feel like it. But\nsay!”--the thought suddenly struck him--“if you want to come out with\nme, I'll blow you off to the swaggerest dinner in London. What d'ye\nsay?”\n\nShe shook her head. “I shall have some bread and cheese and beer at\nnine. That's my rule, you know. I don't like to break it. I'm always\nqueer next day if I do. But now make haste and tell me--you're really\nnot broken then? You have really come out well?”\n\nFor answer he rose, and drew himself to his full height, and spread his\nbulky shoulders backward. His grey-blue eyes looked down upon her with a\ntriumphant glow.\n\n“Broken?” he echoed her word, with emphasis. “My dear Louisa, I'm not\nthe sort that gets broken. I break other people. Oh, God, how I shall\nbreak them!”\n\nHe began pacing up and down on the narrow rug before the fender,\nexcitedly telling his story to her. Sometimes he threw the words over\nhis shoulder; again he held her absorbed gaze with his. He took his\nhands often from his pockets, to illustrate or enforce by gestures the\nmeaning of his speech--and then she found it peculiarly difficult to\nrealize that he was her brother.\n\nMuch of the narrative, rambling and disconnected, with which he prefaced\nthis story of the day, was vaguely familiar to her. He sketched now for\nher in summary, and with the sonorous voice of one deeply impressed with\nthe dramatic values of his declamation, the chronicle of his wanderings\nin strange lands--and these he had frequently told her about before.\nSoon she perceived, however, that he was stringing them together on a\nnew thread. One after another, these experiences of his, as he related\nthem, turned upon the obstacles and fatal pitfalls which treachery and\nmalice had put in his path. He seemed, by his account, to have been a\nhundred times almost within touch of the goal. In China, in the Dutch\nIndies, in those remoter parts of Australia which were a waterless\nwaste when he knew them and might have owned them, and now were\nyielding fabulous millions to fellows who had tricked and swindled\nhim--everywhere he had missed by just a hair's breadth the golden\nconsummation. In the Western hemisphere the tale repeated itself. There\nhad been times in the Argentine, in Brazil just before the Empire fell,\nin Colorado when the Silver boom was on, in British Columbia when the\nfirst rumours of rich ore were whispered about--many times when fortune\nseemed veritably within his grasp. But someone had always played him\nfalse. There was never a friendship for him which could withstand the\ntemptation of profitable treason.\n\nBut he had hung dauntlessly on. He had seen one concession slipping\nthrough his fingers, only to strain and tighten them for a clutch at\nanother. It did not surprise his hearer--nor indeed did it particularly\nattract her attention--that there was nowhere in this rapid and\ncomprehensive narrative any allusion to industry of the wage-earning\nsort. Apparently, he had done no work at all, in the bread-winner's\nsense of the word. This was so like Joel that it was taken for granted\nin his sister's mind. All his voyages and adventures and painful\nenterprises had been informed by the desire of the buccaneer--the\npassion to reap where others had sown, or, at the worst, to get\nsomething for nothing.\n\nThe discursive story began to narrow and concentrate itself when at last\nit reached Mexico. The sister changed her position in her chair, and\ncrossed her knees when Tehuantepec was mentioned. It was from that\nplace that Joel had sent her the amazing remittance over two years ago.\nCuriously enough, though, it was at this point in his narrative that he\nnow became vague as to details. There were concessions of rubber forests\nmentioned, and the barter of these for other concessions with money\nto boot, and varying phases of a chronic trouble about where the true\nboundary of Guatemala ran--but she failed clearly to understand much\nabout it all. His other schemes and mishaps she had followed readily\nenough. Somehow when they came to Mexico, however, she saw everything\njumbled and distorted, as through a haze. Once or twice she interrupted\nhim to ask questions, but he seemed to attach such slight importance to\nher comprehending these details that she forbore. Only one fact was\nit necessary to grasp about the Mexican episode, apparently. When\nhe quitted Tehuantepec, to make his way straight to London, at the\nbeginning of the year, he left behind him a rubber plantation which he\ndesired to sell, and brought with him between six and seven thousand\npounds, with which to pay the expenses of selling it. How he had\nobtained either the plantation or the money did not seem to have made\nitself understood. No doubt, as his manner indicated when she ventured\nher enquiries, it was quite irrelevant to the narrative.\n\nIn Mexico, his experience had been unique, apparently, in that no\nvillain had appeared on the scene to frustrate his plans. He at least\nmentioned no one who had wronged him there. When he came to London,\nhowever, there were villains and to spare. He moved to the mantel, when\nhe arrived at this stage of the story, and made clear a space for his\nelbow to rest among the little trinkets and photographs with which it\nwas burdened. He stood still thereafter, looking down at her; his voice\ntook on a harsher note.\n\nMuch of this story, also, she knew by heart. This strange, bearded,\ngreyish-haired brother of hers had come very often during the past\nhalf-year to the little book-shop, and the widow's home above it, his\nmisshapen handbag full of papers, his heart full of rage, hope, grief,\nambition, disgust, confidence--everything but despair. It was true, it\nhad never been quite real to her. He was right in his suggestion that\nshe had never wholly believed in him. She had not been able to take\naltogether seriously this clumsy, careworn, shabbily-dressed man who\ntalked about millions. It was true that he had sent her four hundred\npounds for the education of her son and daughter; it was equally true\nthat he had brought with him to London a sum which any of his ancestors,\nso far as she knew about them, would have deemed a fortune, and which he\ntreated as merely so much oil, with which to lubricate the machinery of\nhis great enterprise. She had heard, at various times, the embittered\ndetails of the disappearance of this money, little by little. Nearly a\nquarter of it, all told, had been appropriated by a sleek old braggart\nof a company-promoter, who had cozened Joel into the belief that London\ncould be best approached through him. When at last this wretch was\nkicked downstairs, the effect had been only to make room for a fresh\nlot of bloodsuckers. There were so-called advertising agents, so-called\njournalists, so-called “men of influence in the City,”--a swarm of\nrelentless and voracious harpies, who dragged from him in blackmail\nnearly the half of what he had left, before he summoned the courage and\ndecision to shut them out.\n\nWorse still, in some ways, were the men into whose hands he stumbled\nnext--a group of City men concerned in the South African market, who\nimpressed him very favourably at the outset. He got to know them by\naccident, and at the time when he began to comprehend the necessity of\nsecuring influential support for his scheme. Everything that he heard\nand could learn about them testified to the strength of their position\nin the City. Because they displayed a certain amiability of manner\ntoward him and his project, he allowed himself to make sure of their\nsupport. It grew to be a certainty in his mind that they would see him\nthrough. He spent a good deal of money in dinners and suppers in their\nhonour, after they had let him understand that this form of propitiation\nwas not unpleasant to them. They chaffed him about some newspaper\nparagraphs, in which he was described as the “Rubber King,” with\nan affable assumption of amusement, under which he believed that he\ndetected a genuine respect for his abilities.\n\nFinally, when he had danced attendance upon them for the better part\nof two months, he laid before them, at the coffee-and-cigars stage of a\ndinner in a private room of the Savoy, the details of his proposition.\nThey were to form a Syndicate to take over his property, and place it\nupon the market; in consideration of their finding the ready money for\nthis exploitation, they were to have for themselves two-fifths of the\nshares in the Company ultimately to be floated. They listened to these\ndetails, and to his enthusiastic remarks about the project itself, with\nrather perfunctory patience, but committed themselves that evening to\nnothing definite. It took him nearly a week thereafter to get an answer\nfrom any of them. Then he learned that, if they took the matter up at\nall, it would be upon the basis of the Syndicate receiving nine-tenths\nof the shares.\n\nHe conceived the idea, after he had mastered his original amazement,\nthat they named these preposterous terms merely because they expected\nto be beaten down, and he summoned all his good nature and tact for\nthe task of haggling with them. He misunderstood their first show of\nimpatience at this, and persevered in the face of their tacit rebuffs.\nThen, one day, a couple of them treated him with overt rudeness, and\nhe, astonished out of his caution, replied to them in kind. Suddenly, he\ncould hardly tell why or how, they were all enemies of his. They\nclosed their office doors to him; even their clerks treated him with\ncontemptuous incivility.\n\nThis blow to his pride enraged and humiliated him, curiously enough, as\nno other misadventure of his life had done.\n\nLouisa remembered vividly the description he had given to her, at the\ntime, of this affair. She had hardly understood why it should disturb\nhim so profoundly: to her mind, these men had done nothing so monstrous\nafter all. But to him, their offense swallowed up all the other\nindignities suffered during the years of his Ishmaelitish wanderings. A\nsombre lust for vengeance upon them took root in his very soul. He hated\nnobody else as he hated them. How often she had heard him swear, in\nsolemn vibrating tones, that to the day of his death his most sacred\nambition should be their punishment, their abasement in the dust and\nmire!\n\nAnd now, all at once, as she looked up at him, where he leant against\nthe mantel, these vagabond memories of hers took point and shape. It was\nabout these very men that he was talking.\n\n“And think of it!” he was saying, impressively. “It's magnificent enough\nfor me to make this great hit--but I don't count it as anything at\nall by comparison with the fact that I make it at their expense. You\nremember the fellows I told you about?” he asked abruptly, deferring to\nthe confused look on her face.\n\n“Yes--you make it out of them,” she repeated, in an uncertain voice. It\noccurred to her that she must have been almost asleep. “But did I miss\nanything? Have you been telling what it is that you have made?”\n\n“No--that you shall have in good time. You don't seem to realize it,\nLouisa. I can hardly realize it myself. I am actually a very rich man.\nI can't tell how much I've got--in fact, it can be almost as much as I\nlike--half a million pounds, I suppose, at the start, if I want to make\nit that much. Yes--it takes the breath away, doesn't it? But best of\nall--a thousand times best of all--practically every dollar of it comes\nout of those Kaffir swine--the very men that tried to rob me, and\nthat have been trying to ruin me ever since. I tell you what I wish,\nLouise--I wish to God there could only be time enough, and I'd take it\nall in half-sovereigns--two millions of them, or three millions--and\njust untwist every coin, one by one, out from among their heart-strings.\nOh--but it'll be all right as it is. It's enough to make a man feel\nreligious--to think how those thieves are going to suffer.”\n\n“Well” she said, slowly after reflection, “it all rather frightens me.”\n\nAs if the chill in the air of the cheerless room had suddenly\naccentuated itself, she arose, took a match-box from the mantel, and,\nstooping, lit the fire.\n\nHe looked down at the tall, black-clad figure, bent in stiff awkwardness\nover the smoking grate, and his eyes softened. Then he took fresh note\nof the room--the faded, threadbare carpet, the sparse old furniture that\nhad seemed ugly to even his uninformed boyish taste, the dingy walls and\nbegrimed low ceiling--all pathetic symbols of the bleak life to which\nshe had been condemned.\n\n“Frightens you?” he queried, with a kind of jovial tenderness, as she\ngot to her feet; “frightens you, eh? Why, within a month's time, old\nlady, you'll be riding in the Park in your own carriage, with niggers\nfolding their arms up behind, and you'll be taking it all as easy and as\nnatural as if you'd been born in a barouche.”\n\nHe added, in response to the enquiry of her lifted brows: “Barouche?\nThat's what we'd call in England a landau.”\n\nShe stood with a foot upon the fender, her tired, passive face inclined\nmeditatively, her rusty old black gown drawn back by one hand from the\nsnapping sparks. “No,” she said, slowly, joyless resignation mingling\nwith pride in her voice. “I was born here over the shop.”\n\n“Well, good God! so was I,” he commented, lustily. “But that's no reason\nwhy I shouldn't wind up in Park Lane--or you either.”\n\nShe had nothing to say to this, apparently. After a little, she seated\nherself again, drawing her chair closer to the hearth. “It's years since\nI've lit this fire before the first of November,” she remarked, with the\nair of defending the action to herself.\n\n“Oh, we're celebrating,” he said, rubbing his hands over the reluctant\nblaze. “Everything goes, tonight!”\n\nHer face, as she looked up at him, betrayed the bewilderment of her\nmind. “You set out to tell me what it was all about,” she reminded him.\n“You see I'm completely in the dark. I only hear you say that you've\nmade a great fortune. That's all I know. Or perhaps you've told me as\nmuch as you care to.”\n\n“Why, not at all,” he reassured her, pulling his own chair toward him\nwith his foot, and sprawling into it with a grunt of relief. “If you'll\ndraw me a glass of that beer of yours, I'll tell you all about it. It's\nnot a thing for everybody to know, not to be breathed to a human being,\nfor that matter--but you'll enjoy it, and it'll be safe enough with\nyou.”\n\nAs she rose, and moved toward a door, he called merrily after her: “No\nmore beer when that keg runs dry, you know. Nothing but champagne!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nTHORPE took a long, thoughtful pull at the beer his sister brought him.\n\n“Ah, I didn't know I was so thirsty,” he said, when he put the glass\ndown. “Truth is--I've lost track of myself altogether since--since the\nbig thing happened. I seem to be somebody else--a comparative stranger,\nso to speak. I've got to get acquainted with myself, all over again. You\ncan't imagine what an extraordinary feeling it is--this being hit every\nfew minutes with the recollection that you're worth half a million.\nIt's like being struck over the head. It knocks you down. There are such\nthousands of things to do--you dance about, all of a flutter. You don't\nknow where to begin.”\n\n“Begin where you left off,” suggested Louisa. “You were going to tell me\nhow--how 'the big thing' happened. You're always coming to it--and never\ngetting any further.”\n\nNodding comprehension of the rebuke's justification, he plunged\nforthwith into the tale.\n\n“You remember my telling you at the time how I got my Board together.\nI'm speaking now of the present Company--after I'd decided to be my own\npromoter, and have at least some kind of 'a look-in' for my money. There\nwasn't much money left, by the way; it was considerably under three\nthousand. But I come to that later. First there was the Board. Here was\nwhere that Lord Plowden that I told you about--the man that came over on\nthe ship with me--came in. I went to him. I--God! I was desperate--but I\nhadn't much of an idea he'd consent. But he did! He listened to me, and\nI told him how I'd been robbed, and how the Syndicate would have cut my\nthroat if I hadn't pulled away,--and he said, 'Why, yes, I'll go on your\nBoard.' Then I told him more about it, and presently he said he'd get me\nanother man of title--a sky-scraper of a title too--to be my Chairman.\nThat's the Marquis of Chaldon, a tremendous diplomatic swell, you know,\nAmbassador at Vienna in his time, and Lord Lieutenant and all sorts of\nthings, but willing to gather in his five hundred a year, all the same.”\n\n“Do you mean that YOU pay HIM five hundred pounds a year?” asked the\nsister.\n\n“Yes, I've got a live Markiss who works for me at ten quid a week, and a\nfew extras. The other Directors get three hundred. This Lord Plowden\nis one of them--but I'll tell you more about him later on. Then there's\nWatkin, he's a small accountant Finsbury way; and Davidson, he's a\nwine-merchant who used to belong to a big firm in Dundee, but gets along\nthe best way he can on a very dicky business here in London, now. And\nthen there's General Kervick, awfully well-connected old chap, they say,\nbut I guess he needs all he can get. He's started wearing his fur-coat\nalready. Well, that's my Board. I couldn't join it, of course, till\nafter allotment--that's because I'm the vendor, as they call it--but\nthat hasn't interfered at all with my running the whole show. The Board\ndoesn't really count, you know. It only does what I want it to do. It's\njust a form that costs me seventeen hundred a year, that's all.”\n\n“Seventeen hundred a year,” she repeated, mechanically.\n\n“Well, then we got out the prospectus, d'ye see. Or first, there were\nother things to be done. I saw that a good broker's name counted for\na lot on a prospectus. I picked out one that I'd heard was\nreasonable--it'd been a splendid name if I could have got it--but he\ncalmly said his price was two thousand pounds, all cash down--and I came\naway. Finally I got a fellow who hadn't done much of anything yet, and\nso wasn't so stiff about his figure. He agreed to take 500 pounds cash,\nand 2,000 in shares. It was God's luck that I hit on him, for he turned\nout, at the pinch, to be the one man in a million for me. But I'll tell\nyou about him later. He's the Broker, mind; you mustn't forget him.\nWell, then, he and I got a Solicitor--he took 200 pounds cash, but he\nhad to have 2,000 shares--and the firm of Auditors--they were 100 pounds\ncash and 1,000 shares. Every company has to have these people pasted on\nto it, by law. Oh yes, and then you must have your Bankers. You\ndon't pay them anything, though, thank God! Well, then, there was\nthe machinery complete, all ready to start. I took a handsome set of\noffices, and furnished them up to the nines--but that I was able to do\npretty well on credit. You see, ready money was getting short.\n\n“And now came the biggest pull of all. There was the press to be\nworked.”\n\nHe spoke as if there were no other papers in London but the financial\njournals.\n\n“I didn't sleep much while that was being fixed up. You've got no more\nidea of what the press means, Louisa, than you have of--of a coil of\nsnakes thawing out hungry in the spring. Why, if one blackmailer came\nto me, I swear a hundred did. They scared the life out of me, the first\nmonth or so. And then there's a swarm of advertising agents, who say\nthey can keep these blackmailers off, if you'll make it worth their\nwhile. But they all wanted too much money for me--and for a while I was\nat my wits' ends. At last I got a fellow--he's not behaved so badly, all\nthings considered--who had some sporting blood in his veins, and he was\nwilling to do the whole thing for 5,000 pounds, if I could pay 1,500\npounds down, and the rest in shares. But that was just what I couldn't\ndo, you see, so finally he took 1,000 pounds down and 5,000 in\nshares--and as I say he's done it tolerably well. There was one editor\nthat I had to square personally--that is to say, 100 pounds cash--it\nhad to be in sovereigns, for notes could be traced--and a call of 2,000\nshares at par,--he's the boss pirate that everybody has to square--and\nof course there were odd ten-pound notes here and there, but as a rule\nI just opened the door and fired the black-mailers out. The moment a\nfellow came in, and handed me his card, and said he had proofs of two\nkinds of articles in his pocket, one praising me, one damning me, I told\nhim to go and see my advertising agent, and if he wouldn't do that, then\nto go to hell. That's the way you've got to talk in the City,” he added,\nas if in apologetic explanation.\n\nLouisa looked impassively at her brother. “Oh, I've heard the expression\nas far west as the Strand,” she remarked.\n\n“Well, then came the issue. That was last Saturday. You saw the\nprospectus in Saturday morning's papers, and in the weeklies. The\nlist was to be kept open, it said, till Wednesday morning--that was\nyesterday. That is to say, during all that time, people could apply for\nshares.”\n\n“Which they didn't do--according to your account,” the sister suggested,\ndryly.\n\nThorpe passed his fingers through his roughened hair, and eyed her with\na momentary quizzical gleam in his eye. Then he became serious again.\nThe recollection of what he was now to narrate brought a frown to his\nbrows.\n\n“On Tuesday afternoon,” he began, with portentous deliberation--“Or no,\nfirst I must explain something. You see, in bringing out a company, you\ncan't put up too stout a bluff. I mean, you've got to behave as if\nyou were rolling in wealth--as if everything was coming your way, and\nfortunes were to be made by fastening to you. I don't know that it often\nfools anybody very much, but it's part of the game, and you must play\nit. Well, accordingly, my Broker goes on 'change Saturday morning, and\nhas his jobber shout out that he'll buy 'Rubber Consols'--that's what\nour shares are called on the street--at an eighth premium; that is to\nsay, he offered to buy for twenty-two-and-six what we were offering to\nthe public for twenty shillings. Of course, you see, the object of that\nwas to create the impression that there was a regular God-almighty\nrush for our shares. As I say, I don't know whether that ever fooled\nanybody--but at least there was the chance that it might start up some\ndealing in the shares--and all those things help. Besides, you got the\nsales noticed in the papers, and that might start up applications from\nthe public. Well, the Broker bought 1,000 shares this way on Saturday.\nOn Monday, when it might still be possible to change the luck, he bought\n3,500 more, still at that premium of an eighth. He bought some Tuesday\nmorning too--say 4,000. Well, now, keep those figures in your head, and\nkeep an eye on the Broker. He's worth watching--as you'll see.”\n\n“What's his name?” asked the sister, with an accession of alertness in\nher face. “You call him 'Broker'--and that doesn't mean anything to me.\nThey're all brokers, aren't they?”\n\n“Semple--Colin Semple, that's his name. He's a young Scotchman--father's\na Presbyterian minister. He's a little, insignificant runt of a chap to\nlook at--but I learned a long time ago not to judge a singed cat by his\nlooks. However--where was I?”\n\n“You were going to tell about Tuesday afternoon, weren't you?”\n\nHe nodded gravely, and straightened himself, drawing a long breath in\npreparation for the dramatic recital before him. “On Tuesday afternoon,”\n he began again, with impressive slowness, “I was walking on Throgmorton\nStreet, about four o'clock. It was raining a little--it had been raining\non and off all day--a miserable, rotten sort of a day, with greasy mud\neverywhere, and everybody poking umbrellas into you. I was out walking\nbecause I'd 'a' cut my throat if I'd tried to stay in the office another\nten minutes. All that day I hadn't eaten anything. I hadn't slept worth\nspeaking of for three nights. The whole game was up for me. I was worse\nthan ruined. I had half a crown in my pocket. I had ten or twelve pounds\nin the bank--and they wouldn't let me overdraw a farthing. I tell you, I\nwas just plumb busted.\n\n“There came along in the gutter a sandwich-man. I'd seen the cuss before\nduring the day, walking up and down near my offices. I took notice\nof him, because he was the raggedest, dirtiest, most forlorn-looking\ncripple you ever saw in your life. Now I read what was on his boards. It\nwas the bill of a paper that I had refused to be bled by, and there\nit was in big letters: 'The Rubber Bubble Burst!' 'Thorpe's Audacity\nPunished!' Those were the words. I can see them with my eyes shut. I\nstood there, looking at the fellow, and I suppose there was something in\nthe way I looked, for he stopped too. Of course, he didn't know me from\nAdam, but all the same, I'm damned if he didn't wink his eye at me--as\nif we two had a joke between us. And at that I burst out laughing--I\nsimply roared with laughter, like a boy at a pantomime--and I took that\nlast half-crown out of my pocket, and I gave it to the sandwich-man.\nGod! you should have seen his face.”\n\n“I don't particularly mind, Joel,” said his sister, “but I never heard\nyou swear so much before.”\n\n“Oh, what the--what the deuce!” he protested, impatiently. “Don't\ninterrupt me now! Well, I went on down the street. The members of the\nStock Exchange were coming out of 'the house,' and making up little\ngroups on the pavement. They do business inside, you know, until closing\ntime--this day it happened to be four o'clock--and then they come out\nand deal in the street with one another, with the kerb-stone mob, who\nare not allowed inside, standing round to watch the thing. I came along\ninto the thick of these fellows; they were yelling out all sorts of\nthings--'East Rands,' 'Oroyas,' 'Lake View Centrals,' and what not, but\nthese went in one ear and out the other. If there ever was a man with no\nstomach for the market it was me. But then someone roared out:\n\n“'At seven-eighths, sell Rubber Consols! Sell five hundred Rubber at\nseven-eighths! Sell five hundred at three-quarters! At three-quarters\nyou have 'em! Rubber Consols! Sell a thou. at three-quarters!'\n\n“This thing went into my brain like a live coal. I stopped and looked\nup at the fellow--and by God, it was one of the men I've been\ntalking about--one of those Kaffir scoundrels. I wish I was better at\nremembering names--but I knew his face. There were some of the others\naround him, and they laughed at me, and he laughed at me. Oh, they had\na heap of fun out of me--for a minute or two. Pretty good fun, too! I\nguess they'll remember it quite a while.”\n\n“Go on!” Louisa adjured him. The obvious proximity of the dramatic\nclimax drew her forward in her chair, and brought a glow of expectation\nto her eyes.\n\n“I got myself away from that crowd somehow--I think I was afraid if I\nstayed I'd strangle the one who was shouting on the steps--and I went\ntoward my office. But when I got to the door, I didn't have the courage\nto go in. I'd furnished it better, I suppose, than any other office\nin Austin Friars, and I had a kind of feeling that the sight of those\ncarpets, and oak-tables and desks, and brass-railings and so on would\nmake me sick. I owed for 'em all, bear in mind----”\n\n“But--Joel,” the sister interposed. “One thing I don't understand. How\nmany people had applied for shares? You haven't mentioned that.”\n\nA fleeting smile lighted up the saturnine gloom of his present mood. “It\nwas hardly worth mentioning,” he answered, with bitter mirth. “Between\nfive and six thousand shares were subscribed, all told. I think the\nwithdrawals by telegraph brought it down to practically five thousand.\nWe offered a hundred thousand, you know.--But let me go on with my\nstory. I stood there, in front of our street-door, in a kind of trance.\nThe words of that Jew--'Sell Rubber Consols at three-quarters!'--buzzed\ninside my head as if they would burst it open. I turned--and I happened\nto see my Broker--the Scotchman, Semple, you know--coming along toward\nme. Right at that minute, like a flash, something dawned on me. In less\nthan a second, I saw the whole damned rotten outfit turned upside down,\nwith me on top. I made a jump, and ran to meet Semple.\n\n“'How many shares of ours have you bought?' I asked him, with a grip\ntight on his arm.\n\n“The little chap was looking mighty sick. He figured up in his mind.\n'I'm afraid it's eight thousand five hundred, all told,' he said, in a\nsort of Presbyterian whimper.\n\n“'Well--how would these gentlemen go about it to deliver their\ngoods--that is, supposing we got a settlement?'\n\n“I asked him this, and kept my eye on his face. He looked puzzled for a\nminute. Then he put out his lip. Then he shot me a glance as sharp as a\nrazor, and we looked into one another's eyes.\n\n“'They were shouting them out to me at three-quarters, a minute ago,' I\ntold him.\n\n“He was onto the game like lightning. 'Wait for me in the office,' he\nwhispered. 'We'll go nap on this!'\n\n“With that he was off like a streak. He stopped running just before he\ngot to the corner, though, and began walking slowly, sauntering along,\nyou know, as if his mind was on nothing but second-hand books. I watched\nhim out of sight--and then I went back, and up to the offices. The\nfurniture didn't scare me a bit this time. Why, I stopped and felt\nof the brass-railing just outside the Board Room, and I said to\nmyself--'Pshaw! We could have you of solid gold, if we wanted to.'”\n\nHe paused here, and regarded his sister with what she felt was intended\nto be a significant look. She shrank from the confession that its\nmeaning was Greek to her. “Well--and what next?” she asked, guardedly.\n\n“Semple came back in twenty minutes or so--and the next morning he was\nat it again--and what with him and his jobber, by George, on the quiet,\nthey picked up nearly eighteen thousand of our shares. Some they paid\nfifteen shillings for, some they got at twelve-and-six and even ten.\nThat doesn't matter; it's of no more importance than the coppers you\ngive to crossing-sweepers. The thing was to get the shares--and by God\nwe've got them! Twenty-six thousand two hundred shares, that's what\nwe've got. Now, do you see what that means?”\n\n“Why yes,” she answered, with a faint-hearted assumption of confidence.\n“Of course, you know the property is so good that you'll make a profit\non the shares you've bought far below their value. But I don't think I\nquite see----”\n\nHe interrupted her with an outburst of loud laughter. “Don't think you\nquite see?” he gurgled at her, with tears of pleasure in his eye. “Why,\nyou dummy, you haven't got the faintest glimmer of a notion of what it's\nall about. The value of the property's got nothing in the world to\ndo with it. That's neither here nor there. If there wasn't any such\nproperty in existence, it would be just the same.”\n\nHe had compassion upon her blank countenance, at this, and explained\nmore gently: “Why, don't you see, Lou, it's this way. This is what has\nhappened. We've got what's called a corner on the bears. They're caught\nshort, and we can squeeze them to our hearts' content. What--you don't\nunderstand now? Why, see here! These fellows who've sold twenty-six\nthousand of our shares--they haven't got them to sell, and they\ncan't get them. That is the point--they can't get them for love nor\nmoney--they must pay me my own price for them, or be ruined men. The\nmoment they realize the situation, they will begin offering a premium\nfor Rubber Consols. The price of a one-pound share will be two pounds,\nthen four--six--ten--twenty--thirty--whatever I want to drive it to.”\n\nLouisa stared up at him with wide open eyes. It seemed to her that she\nunderstood now. It was very exciting.\n\n“You see,” he went on, taking approving note of the new light of\ncomprehension in her glance, “we did something that Tuesday afternoon\nbeside buy up these shares. Semple rushed off to his office, and he and\nhis clerks got up a lot of dummy applications for shares, made out in\nall the different names they could be safe in using, and they put these\ninto the bank with the application money--Semple found that--and next\nday he went and saw the advertising agent and the solicitor and the\nauditors--and got them to pool the shares that I've promised to give\nthem. A pool? That means they agree to transfer their shares to me\nas trustee, and let me deal with them as I like--of course to their\nadvantage. In any case, their shares are vendor's shares, and couldn't\nbe dealt with in this transaction. So you see the thing is hermetically\nsealed. Nobody can get a share except from me, and at my price. But\nthese fellows that have sold them--they've got to have them, don't you\nsee. They had their little temporary joke with me on the street that\nafternoon--and now they must walk up to the captain's office and settle.\nThey've got to pay me at least half a million pounds for that few\nminutes' fun of theirs. I may make it a good deal more; I don't know\nyet.”\n\n“Oh, Joel!” she groaned at him, in awed stupefaction. His rather\nlanguid indecision as to whether half a million was going to be enough,\nimpressed her more powerfully than had any detail of his narrative.\n\nIn a few comprehensive sentences he finished up for her what there was\nto tell. “This afternoon my Board met to allot the shares. They saw the\napplications, amounting in all to over ninety thousand shares. It took\ntheir breath away--they had heard that things were going quite the\nother way with us. They were so tickled that they asked no questions The\nallotment went through like a greased pig. About 5,000 shares went to\nthose who had actually applied for them, and 88,000 were solemnly given\nto the dummy applicants. Of course, there wasn't a whisper about these\ndummies. Nobody winked so much as an eyelash. But I've found since that\none of the directors--that Lord Plowden I told you about--was onto\nthe thing all the while. But he's all right. Everybody's all right. Of\ncourse the dummies' shares still stand in their names--on paper--but in\nreality I've got them all in my safe--in my pocket you might say. They\nare really mine, you understand. So now there's nothing for us to do\nbut to apply to the Stock Exchange for a special settlement date, and\nmeanwhile lie quiet and watch the Jews stew in their own juice. Or fry\nin their own fat, eh? That's better.”\n\n“But,” she commented slowly, “you say there are no shares to be\nbought--and yet as I understand it, there are those five thousand that\nwere sent out to the people who really applied.”\n\n“Bravo, Lou!” he answered her jovially. “You actually do understand the\nthing. You've put your finger straight on the point. It is true that\nthose shares are out against us--or might be turned against us if they\ncould be bought up. But in reality, they don't count at all. In the\nfirst place, you see, they're scattered about among small holders,\ncountry clergymen and old maids on an annuity and so on--all over the\ncountry. Even if these people were all traced, and hunted up, suppose\nit was worth the trouble and expense, they wouldn't sell. The bigger the\nprice they were offered, the more mulish they would be about holding.\nThat's always the way with them. But even if they did all sell, their\nfive thousand would be a mere drop in the bucket. There would be over\ntwenty thousand others to be accounted for. That would be quite enough\nfor my purposes. Oh, I figured all that out very carefully. My own first\nnotion was to have the dummies apply for the whole hundred thousand, and\neven a little over. Then, you see, we might have allotted everything\nto the dummies, and sent back the money and applications of the genuine\nones. But that would have been rather hard to manage with the Board. The\nMarkiss would have said that the returns ought to be made pro rata--that\nis, giving everybody a part of what they applied for--and that would\nhave mixed everything up. And then, too, if anybody suspected\nanything, why the Stock Exchange Committee would refuse us a special\nsettlement--and, of course, without that the whole transaction is\nmoonshine. It was far too risky, and we didn't send back a penny.”\n\n“It's all pretty risky, I should think,” she declared as she rose. “I\nshould think you'd lie awake more than ever now--now that you've built\nyour hopes so high and it'd be so awful to have them come to nothing.”\n\nHe smilingly shook his head. “No, it can no more fail than that gas\ncan fail to burn when you put a light to it. It's all absolute. My\nhalf-million is as right as if it were lying to my credit in the Bank of\nEngland. Oh, that reminds me,” he went on in a slightly altered\ntone--“it's damned comical, but I've got to ask you for a little money.\nI've only got about seven pounds at my bank, and just at the minute it\nwould give me away fearfully to let Semple know I was hard up. Of course\nhe'd let me have anything I wanted--but, you can see--I don't like to\nask him just at the moment.”\n\nShe hesitated visibly, and scanned his face with a wistful gaze. “You're\nquite sure, Joel?”--she began--“and you haven't told me--how long will\nit be before you come into some of this money?”\n\n“Well,”--he in turn paused over his words--“well, I suppose that by next\nweek things will be in such shape that my bank will see I'm good for an\noverdraft. Oh heavens, yes! there'll be a hundred ways of touching some\nready. But if you've got twenty or thirty pounds handy just now--I tell\nyou what I'll do, Lou. I'll give you a three months bill, paying one\nhundred pounds for every sovereign you let me have now. Come, old lady:\nyou don't get such interest every day, I'll bet.”\n\n“I don't want any interest from you, Joel,” she replied, simply. “If\nyou're sure I can have it back before Christmas, I think I can manage\nthirty pounds. It will do in the morning, I suppose?”\n\nHe nodded an amused affirmative. “Why--you don't imagine, do you,”\n he said, “that all this gold is to rain down, and none of it hit you?\nInterest? Why of course you'll get interest--and capital thrown in. What\ndid you suppose?”\n\n“I don't ask anything for myself,” she made answer, with a note of\nresolution in her voice. “Of course if you like to do things for the\nchildren, it won't be me who'll stand in their light. They've been\nspoiled for my kind of life as it is.”\n\n“I'll do things for everybody,” he affirmed roundly. “Let's see--how old\nis Alfred?”\n\n“He'll be twenty in May--and Julia is fourteen months older than he is.”\n\n“Gad!” was Thorpe's meditative comment. “How they shoot up! Why I was\nthinking she was a little girl.” “She never will be tall, I'm afraid,”\n said the literal mother. “She favours her father's family. But Alfred is\nmore of a Thorpe. I'm sorry you missed seeing them last summer--but of\ncourse they didn't stop long with me. This was no place for them--and\nthey had a good many invitations to visit schoolfellows and friends in\nthe country. Alfred reminds me very much of what you were at his age:\nhe's got the same good opinion of himself, too--and he's not a bit\nfonder of hard work.”\n\n“There's one mighty big difference between us, though,” remarked Thorpe.\n“He won't start with his nose held down to the grindstone by an old\nfather hard as nails. He'll start like a gentleman--the nephew of a rich\nman.”\n\n“I'm almost afraid to have such notions put in his head,” she replied,\nwith visible apprehension. “You mustn't encourage him to build too high\nhopes, Joel. It's speculation, you know--and anything might happen to\nyou. And then--you may marry, and have sons of your own.”\n\nHe lifted his brows swiftly--as if the thought were new to his mind. A\nslow smile stole into the little wrinkles about his eyes. He opened his\nlips as if to speak, and then closed them again.\n\n“Well,” he said at last, abruptly straightening himself, and casting an\neye about for his coat and hat. “I'll be round in the morning--on my way\nto the City. Good-bye till then.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nIN Charing Cross station, the next afternoon, Mr. Thorpe discovered by\nthe big clock overhead that he had arrived fully ten minutes too soon.\nThis deviation from his deeply-rooted habit of catching trains at the\nlast possible moment did not take him by surprise. He smiled dryly, aud\nnodded to the illuminated dial, as if they shared the secret of some\nquaint novelty. This getting to the station ahead of time was of a\npiece with what had been happening all day--merely one more token of the\ngeneral upheaval in the routine of his life.\n\nFrom early morning he had been acutely conscious of the feeling that\nhis old manners and usages and methods of thought--the thousand familiar\nthings that made up the Thorpe he had been--were becoming strange to\nhim. They fitted him no longer; they began to fall away from him. Now,\nas he stood here on the bustling platform, it was as if they had all\ndisappeared--been left somewhere behind him outside the station. With\nthe two large bags which the porter was looking after--both of a quite\ndisconcerting freshness of aspect--and the new overcoat and shining\nhat, he seemed to himself a new kind of being, embarked upon a voyage of\ndiscovery in the unknown.\n\nEven his face was new. A sudden and irresistible impulse had led him to\nthe barber-shop in his hotel at the outset; he could not wait till after\nbreakfast to have his beard removed. The result, when he beheld it in\nthe mirror, had not been altogether reassuring. The over-long, thin,\ntawny moustasche which survived the razor assumed an undue prominence;\nthe jaw and chin, revealed now for the first time in perhaps a dozen\nyears, seemed of a sickly colour, and, in some inexplicable way,\nmisshapen. Many times during the day, at his office, at the restaurant\nwhere he lunched, at various outfitters' shops which he had visited, he\nhad pursued the task of getting reconciled to this novel visage in the\nlooking-glass. The little mirrors in the hansom cabs had helped him most\nin this endeavour. Each returned to him an image so different from all\nthe others--some cadaverous, some bloated, but each with a spontaneous\ndistortion of its own--that it had become possible for him to strike an\naverage tolerable to himself, and to believe in it.\n\nHis sister had recognized him upon the instant, when he entered the old\nbook-shop to get the money promised overnight, but in the City his\nown clerks had not known him at first. There was in this an inspiring\nimplication that he had not so much changed his appearance as revived\nhis youth. The consciousness that he was in reality still a young man\nspread over his mind afresh, and this time he felt that it was effacing\nall earlier impressions. Why, when he thought of it, the delight he\nhad had during the day in buying new shirts and handkerchiefs and\nembroidered braces, in looking over the various stocks of razors,\ntoilet articles, studs and sleeve-links, and the like, and telling the\ngratified tradesmen to give him the best of everything--this delight had\nbeen distinctively boyish. He doubted, indeed, if any mere youth could\nhave risen to the heights of tender satisfaction from which he reflected\nupon the contents of his portmanteaus. To apprehend their full value one\nmust have been without them for such a weary time! He had this wonderful\nadvantage--that he supplemented the fresh-hearted joy of the youth in\nnice things, with the adult man's knowledge of how bald existence could\nbe without them. It was worth having lived all those forty obscure and\nmostly unpleasant years, for this one privilege now of being able to\nappreciate to the uttermost the touch of double-silk underwear.\n\nIt was an undoubted pity that there had not been time to go to a good\ntailor. The suit he had on was right enough for ordinary purposes, and\nhis evening-clothes were as good as new, but the thought of a costume\nfor shooting harassed his mind. He had brought along with him, for\nthis eventful visit, an old Mexican outfit of yellowish-grey cloth and\nleather, much the worse for rough wear, but saved from the disreputable\nby its suggestion of picturesque experiences in a strange and romantic\ncountry. At least it had seemed to him, in the morning, when he had\npacked it, to be secure in this salvation. Uneasy doubts on the subject\nhad soon risen, however, and they had increased in volume and poignancy\nas his conceptions of a wardrobe expanded in the course of the day's\ninvestigations and purchases. He had reached the point now of hoping\nthat it would rain bitterly on the morrow.\n\nIt was doubly important to keep a close look-out for Lord Plowden, since\nhe did not know the name of the station they were to book for, and time\nwas getting short. He dwelt with some annoyance upon his oversight in\nthis matter, as his watchful glance ranged from one entrance to another.\nHe would have liked to buy the tickets himself, and have everything in\nreadiness on the arrival of his host. As it was, he could not even tell\nthe porter how his luggage was to be labelled, and there was now\nless than two minutes! He moved forward briskly, with the thought of\nintercepting his friend at the front of the station; then halted, and\nwent back, upon the recollection that while he was going out one way,\nPlowden might come in by the other. The seconds, as they passed now,\nbecame severally painful to his nerves. The ringing of a bell somewhere\nbeyond the barrier provoked within him an impulse to tearful profanity.\n\nThen suddenly everything was all right. A smooth-faced, civilly-spoken\nyoung man came up, touched his hat, and asked: “Will you kindly show me\nwhich is your luggage, sir?”\n\nThorpe, even while wondering what business of his it was, indicated the\nglaringly new bags--and then only half repressed a cry of pleasure at\ndiscovering that Lord Plowden stood beside him.\n\n“It's all right; my man will look out for your things,” said the latter,\nas they shook hands. “We will go and get our places.”\n\nThe fat policeman at the gate touched his helmet. A lean, elderly man\nin a sort of guard's uniform hobbled obsequiously before them down the\nplatform, opened to them a first-class compartment with a low bow and a\ndeprecatory wave of the hand, and then impressively locked the door upon\nthem. “The engine will be the other way, my Lord, after you leave Cannon\nStreet,” he remarked through the open window, with earnest deference.\n“Are there any of your bags that you want in the compartment with you?”\n\nPlowden had nodded to the first remark. He shook his head at the second.\nThe elderly man at this, with still another bow, flapped out a green\nflag which he had been holding furled behind his back, and extended it\nat arm's length. The train began slowly to move. Mr. Thorpe reflected to\nhimself that the peerage was by no means so played-out an institution as\nsome people imagined.\n\n“Ho-ho!” the younger man sighed a yawn, as he tossed his hat into the\nrack above his head. “We shall both be the better for some pure air.\nLondon quite does me up. And you--you've been sticking at it months\non end, haven't you? You look rather fagged--or at all events you did\nyesterday. You've smartened yourself so--without your beard--that I\ncan't say I'd notice it to-day. But I take it every sensible person is\nglad to get away from London.”\n\n“Except for an odd Sunday, now and then, I haven't put my nose outside\nLondon since I landed here.” Thorpe rose as he spoke, to deposit his hat\nalso in the rack. He noted with a kind of chagrin that his companion's\nwas an ordinary low black bowler. “I can tell you, I SHALL be glad of\nthe change. I would have bought the tickets,” he went on, giving words\nat random to the thought which he found fixed on the surface of his\nmind, “if I'd only known what our station was.”\n\nPlowden waved his hand, and the gesture seemed to dismiss the subject.\nHe took a cigar case from his pocket, and offered it to Thorpe.\n\n“It was lucky, my not missing the train altogether,” he said, as they\nlighted their cigars. “I was up late last night--turned out late this\nmorning, been late all day, somehow--couldn't catch up with the clock\nfor the life of me. Your statement to me last night--you know it rather\nupset me.”\n\nThe other smiled. “Well, I guess I know something about that feeling\nmyself. Why, I've been buzzing about today like a hen with her head cut\noff. But it's fun, though, aint it, eh? Just to happen to remember every\nonce in a while, you know, that it's all true! But of course it means a\nthousand times more to me than it does to you.”\n\nThe train had come to a stop inside the gloomy, domed cavern of Cannon\nStreet. Many men in silk hats crowded to and fro on the platform, and a\nnumber of them shook the handle of the locked door. There was an effect\nof curses in the sound of their remarks which came through the closed\nwindow. Mr. Thorpe could not quite restrain the impulse to grin at them.\n\n“Ah, that's where you mistake,” said Plowden, contemplating the mouthful\nof smoke he slowly blew forth. “My dear man, you can't imagine anybody\nto whom it would mean more than it does to me--I hope none of those\nfellows have a key. They're an awful bore on this train. I almost\nnever go by it, for that reason. Ah, thank God we're off!--But as I was\nsaying, this thing makes a greater difference to me than you can think\nof. I couldn't sleep last night--I give you my word--the thing upset me\nso. I take it you--you have never had much money before; that is, you\nknow from experience what poverty is?”\n\nThorpe nodded with eloquent gravity.\n\n“Well--but you”--the other began, and then paused. “What I mean is,”\n he resumed, “you were never, at any rate, responsible to anybody but\nyourself. If you had only a sovereign a day, or a sovereign a week, for\nthat matter, you could accommodate yourself to the requirements of\nthe situation. I don't mean that you would enjoy it any more than I\nshould--but at least it was open to you to do it, without attracting\nmuch attention. But with me placed in my ridiculous position--poverty\nhas been the most unbearable torture one can imagine. You see, there is\nno way in which I can earn a penny. I had to leave the Army when I was\ntwenty-three--the other fellows all had plenty of money to spend, and it\nwas impossible for me to drag along with a title and an empty pocket. I\ndaresay that I ought to have stuck to it, because it isn't nearly so bad\nnow, but twelve years ago it was too cruel for any youngster who had any\npride about him--and, of course, my father having made rather a name in\nthe Army, that made it so much harder for me. And after that, what was\nthere? Of course, the bar and medicine and engineering and those things\nwere out of the question, in those days at least. The Church?--that was\nmore so still. I had a try at politics--but you need money there as\nmuch as anywhere else--money or big family connections. I voted in\npractically every division for four years, and I made the rottenest\nspeeches you ever heard of at Primrose League meetings in small places,\nand after all that the best thing the whips could offer me was a billet\nin India at four hundred a year, and even that you took in depreciated\nrupees. When I tried to talk about something at home, they practically\nlaughed in my face. I had no leverage upon them whatever. They didn't\ncare in the least whether I came up and voted or stopped at home. Their\nmajority was ten to one just the same--yes, twenty to one. So that door\nwas shut in my face. I've never been inside the House since--except once\nto show it to an American lady last summer--but when I do go again I\nrather fancy”--he stopped for an instant, and nodded his handsome head\nsignificantly--“I rather fancy I shall turn up on the other side.”\n\n“I'm a Liberal myself, in English politics,” interposed Thorpe.\n\nPlowden seemed not to perceive the connection. They had left London\nBridge behind, and he put his feet up on the cushions, and leant back\ncomfortably. “Of course there was the City,” he went on, speaking\ndiagonally across to his companion, between leisurely intervals of\nabsorption in his cigar. “There have been some directors' fees, no\ndoubt, and once or twice I've come very near to what promised to be a\nbig thing--but I never quite pulled it off. Really, without capital what\ncan one do?--I'm curious to know--did you bring much ready money with\nyou to England?”\n\n“Between six and seven thousand pounds.”\n\n“And if it's a fair question--how much of it have you got left?”\n\nThorpe had some momentary doubts as to whether this was a fair question,\nbut he smothered them under the smile with which he felt impelled to\nanswer the twinkle in Plowden's eyes. “Oh, less than a hundred,” he\nsaid, and laughed aloud.\n\nPlowden also laughed. “By George, that's fine!” he cried. “It's\nsplendid. There's drama in it. I felt it was like that, you know.\nSomething told me it was your last cartridge that rang the bell. It was\nthat that made me come to you as I did--and tell you that you were\na great man, and that I wanted to enlist under you. Ah, that kind of\ncourage is so rare! When a man has it, he can stand the world on\nits head.” “But I was plumb scared, all the while, myself,” Thorpe\nprotested, genially. “Courage? I could feel it running out of my boots.”\n\n“Ah, yes, but that's the great thing,” insisted the other. “You didn't\nlook as if you were frightened. From all one could see, your nerve was\nsublime. And nothing else matters--it was sublime.”\n\n“Curious--that thing happened to me once before,” commented Thorpe, with\nruminating slowness. “It was out on the plains, years ago, and I was\nin pretty hard luck, and was making my way alone from Tucson north, and\nsome cowboys held me up, and were going to make kindling wood of me,\nthey being under the impression that I was a horse-thief they were\nlooking after. There was five or six minutes there when my life\nwasn't worth a last year's bird's-nest--and I tell you, sir, I was the\nscaredest man that ever drew the breath of life. And then something\nhappened to be said that put the matter right--they saw I was the wrong\nman--and then--why then they couldn't be polite enough to me. They half\nemptied their flasks down my throat, and they rode with me all the way\nto the next town, and there they wanted to buy everything liquid in the\nplace for me. But what I was speaking of--do you know, those fellows got\na tremendous notion of my nerve. It wasn't so much that they told me\nso, but they told others about it. They really thought I was game to the\ncore--when in reality, as I tell you, I was in the deadliest funk you\never heard of.”\n\n“That's just it,” said Plowden, “the part of you which was engaged in\nmaking mental notes of the occasion thought you were frightened; we will\nsay that it was itself frightened. But the other part of you, the part\nthat was transacting business, so to speak--that wasn't in the least\nalarmed. I fancy all born commanders are built like that. Did you ever\nsee General Grant?”\n\nThorpe shook his head.\n\n“What reminded me of him--there is an account in his Memoirs of how he\nfelt when he first was given a command, at the beginning of the Civil\nWar. He was looking about for the enemy, who was known to be in the\nvicinity, and the nearer he got to where this enemy probably was, the\nmore he got timid and unnerved, he says, until it seemed as if cowardice\nwere getting complete mastery of him. And then suddenly it occurred to\nhim that very likely the enemy was just as afraid of him as he was of\nthe enemy, and that moment his bravery all returned to him. He went in\nand gave the other man a terrible thrashing. It doesn't apply to your\ncase, particularly--but I fancy that all really brave men have those\ninner convictions of weakness, even while they are behaving like\nlions. Those must have been extraordinarily interesting experiences of\nyours--on the plains. I wish I could have seen something of that part\nof America when I was there last year. Unfortunately, it didn't come my\nway.”\n\n“I thought I remembered your saying you'd been West.”\n\nPlowden smiled. “I'm afraid I did think it was West at the time. But\nsince my return I've been warned that I mustn't call Chicago West. That\nwas as far as I went. I had some business there, or thought I had. When\nmy father died, that was in 1884, we found among his papers a lot of\nbonds of some corporation purporting to be chartered by the State of\nIllinois. Our solicitors wrote several letters, but they could find out\nnothing about them, and there the matter rested. Finally, last year,\nwhen I decided to make the trip, I recollected these old bonds, and\ntook them with me. I thought they might at least pay my expenses. But\nit wasn't the least good. Nobody knew anything about them. It seems they\nrelated to something that was burned up in the Great Fire--either that,\nor had disappeared before that time. That fire seems to have operated\nlike the Deluge--it cancelled everything that had happened previously.\nMy unhappy father had a genius for that kind of investment. I shall\nhave great pleasure in showing you tomorrow, a very picturesque and\ncomprehensive collection of Confederate Bonds. Their face value is, as I\nremember it, eighty thousand dollars--that is, sixteen thousand pounds.\nI would entertain with joy an offer of sixteen shillings for the lot.\nMy dear father bought them--I should not be surprised to learn that he\nbought them at a premium. If they ever touched a premium for a day, that\nis certainly the day that he would have hit upon to buy. Oh, it was too\nrare! Too inspired! He left nearly a hundred thousand pounds' worth of\npaper--that is, on its face--upon which the solicitors realized, I\nthink it was thirteen hundred pounds. It's hard to imagine how he got\nthem--but there were actually bonds among them issued by Kossuth's\nHungarian Republic in 1848. Well--now you can see the kind of\ninheritance I came into, and I have a brother and sister more or less to\nlook after, too.”\n\nThorpe had been listening to these details with an almost exaggerated\nexpression of sympathy upon his face. The voice in which he spoke now\nbetrayed, however, a certain note of incredulity.\n\n“Yes, I see that well enough,” he remarked. “But what I don't perhaps\nquite understand--well, this is it. You have this place of yours in the\ncountry, and preserve game and so on--but of course I see what you mean.\nIt's what you've been saying. What another man would think a comfortable\nliving, is poverty to a man in your position.”\n\n“Oh, the place,” said Plowden. “It isn't mine at all. I could never have\nkept it up. It belongs to my mother. It was her father's place; it has\nbeen in their family for hundreds of years. Her father, I daresay you\nknow, was the last Earl of Hever. The title died with him. He left three\ndaughters, who inherited his estates, and my mother, being the eldest,\ngot the Kentish properties. Of course Hadlow House will come to me\neventually, but it is hers during her lifetime. I may speak of it as\nmy place, but that is merely a facon de parler; it isn't necessary to\nexplain to everybody that it's my mother's. It's my home, and that's\nenough. It's a dear old place. I can't tell you how glad I am that\nyou're going to see it.”\n\n“I'm very glad, too,” said the other, with unaffected sincerity.\n\n“All the ambitions I have in the world,” the nobleman went on, sitting\nupright now, and speaking with a confidential seriousness, “centre round\nHadlow. That is the part of me that I'm keen about. The Plowdens are\nthings of yesterday. My grandfather, the Chancellor, began in a very\nsmall way, and was never anything more than a clever lawyer, with a loud\nvoice and a hard heart, and a talent for money-making and politics.\nHe got a peerage and he left a fortune. My father, for all he was a\nsoldier, had a mild voice and a soft heart. He gave a certain military\ndistinction to the peerage, but he played hell-and-tommy with the\nfortune. And then I come: I can't be either a Chancellor or a General,\nand I haven't a penny to bless myself with. You can't think of a more\nidiotic box for a man to be in. But now--thanks to you--there comes\nthis prospect of an immense change. If I have money at my back--at once\neverything is different with me. People will remember then promptly\nenough that I am a Hadlow, as well as a Plowden. I will make the party\nwhips remember it, too. It won't be a Secretary's billet in India at\nfour hundred a year that they'll offer me, but a Governorship at six\nthousand--that is, if I wish to leave England at all. And we'll see\nwhich set of whips are to have the honour of offering me anything. But\nall that is in the air. It's enough, for the moment, to realize that\nthings have really come my way. And about that--about the success of the\naffair--I suppose there can be no question whatever?”\n\n“Not the slightest,” Thorpe assured him. “Rubber Consols can go up to\nany figure we choose to name.”\n\nLord Plowden proffered the cigar case again, and once more helped\nhimself after he had given his companion a light. Then he threw himself\nback against the cushions, with a long sigh of content. “I'm not going\nto say another word about myself,” he announced, pleasantly. “I've had\nmore than my legitimate innings. You mustn't think that I forget for a\nmoment the reverse of the medal. You're doing wonderful things for me. I\nonly wish it were clearer to me what the wonderful things are that I can\ndo for you.”\n\n“Oh, that'll be all right,” said the other, rather vaguely.\n\n“Perhaps it's a little early for you to have mapped out in your mind\njust what you want to do,” Plowden reflected aloud. “Of course it has\ncome suddenly upon you--just as it has upon me. There are things in\nplenty that we've dreamed of doing, while the power to do them was a\nlong way off. It doesn't at all follow that these are the things we\nshall proceed to do, when the power is actually in our hands. But have\nyou any plans at all? Do you fancy going into Parliament, for example?”\n\n“Yes,” answered Thorpe, meditatively. “I think I should like to go into\nParliament. But that would be some way ahead. I guess I've got my plans\nworked out a trifle more than you think. They may not be very definite,\nas regards details, but their main direction I know well enough. I'm\ngoing to be an English country gentleman.”\n\nLord Plowden visibly winced a little at this announcement. He seemed\nannoyed at the consciousness that he had done so, turning abruptly first\nto stare out of the window, then shifting his position on the seat, and\nat last stealing an uneasy glance toward his companion. Apparently his\ntongue was at a loss for an appropriate comment.\n\nThorpe had lost none of these unwilling tokens of embarrassment. Plowden\nsaw that at once, but it relieved even more than it surprised him to see\nalso that Thorpe appeared not to mind. The older man, indeed, smiled in\ngood-natured if somewhat ironical comprehension of the dumb-show.\n\n“Oh, that'll be all right, too,” he said, with the evident intention\nof reassurance. “I can do it right enough, so far as the big things are\nconcerned. It'll be in the little things that I'll want some steering.”\n\n“I've already told you--you may command me to the utmost of my power,”\n the other declared. Upon reflection, he was disposed to be ashamed\nof himself. His nerves and facial muscles had been guilty of an\nunpardonable lapse into snobbishness--and toward a man, too, who\nhad been capable of behaviour more distinguished in its courtesy and\ngenerosity than any he had encountered in all the “upper circles” put\ntogether. He recalled all at once, moreover, that Thorpe's “h's” were\nperfect--aud, for some occult reason, this completed his confusion.\n\n“My dear fellow”--he began again, confronting with verbal awkwardness\nthe other's quizzical smile--“don't think I doubt anything about you. I\nknow well enough that you can do anything--be anything--you like.”\n\nThorpe laughed softly.\n\n“I don't think you know, though, that I'm a public-school man,” he said.\n\nPlowden lifted his brows in unfeigned surprise. “No--I didn't know\nthat,” he admitted, frankly.\n\n“Yes, I'm a Paul's Pigeon,” Thorpe went on, “as they called them in\nmy day. That's gone out now, I'm told, since they've moved to the big\nbuildings in Hammersmith. I did very well at school, too; came out in\nthe first fourteen. But my father wouldn't carry the thing any further.\nHe insisted on my going into the shop when I left St. Paul's and\nlearning the book-business. He had precisely the same kind of dynastic\nidea, you know, that you fellows have. His father and his grand-father\nhad been booksellers, and he was going to hand on the tradition to me,\nand my son after me. That was his idea. And he thought that Paul's would\nhelp this--but that Oxford would kill it.\n\n“Of course, he was right there--but he was wrong in supposing there was\na bookseller in me. I liked the books well enough, mind you--but damn\nthe people that came to buy them, I couldn't stand it. You stood two\nhours watching to see that men didn't put volumes in their pockets, and\nat the end of that time you'd made a profit of ninepence. While you\nwere doing up the parcel, some fellow walked off with a book worth\neighteen-pence. It was too slow for me. I didn't hit it off with the old\nman, either. We didn't precisely quarrel, but I went off on my own hook.\nI hung about London for some years, trying this thing and that. Once I\nstarted a book-shop of my own--but I did no good here. Finally I turned\nit up altogether, and went to Australia. That was in 1882. I've been in\nalmost every quarter of the globe since; I've known what it was to be\nshipwrecked in a monsoon, and I've lain down in a desert not expecting\nto get up again, with my belt tightened to its last hole for hunger--but\nI can't remember that I ever wished myself back in my father's\nbook-shop.”\n\nPlowden's fine eyes sparkled his appreciation of the other's mood.\nHe was silent for a moment, then lifted his head as if something had\noccurred to him. “You were speaking of the plan that you should succeed\nto your father's business--and your son after you--you're not married,\nare you?”\n\nThorpe slowly shook his head.\n\n“Our station is the next,” said the younger man. “It's a drive of\nsomething under two miles. You'd better light another cigar.” He added,\nas if upon a casual afterthought: “We can both of us think of marrying\nnow.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nFOR the next two hours, Thorpe's thoughts were almost wholly occupied\nwith various phases of the large subject of domestic service. He seemed\nsuddenly to have been transported to some region populated exclusively\nby clean-shaven men in brown livery. One of these was holding a spirited\nhorse outside the station, and when Lord Plowden had taken the reins,\nand Thorpe had gathered the rugs about his knees and feet, this menial\nsilently associated himself with the young man who had accompanied them\nfrom town, on the back seat of the trap. With these people so close\nbehind him, Thorpe felt that any intimate conversation was out of the\nquestion. Indeed, talk of any sort was not invited; the big horse burst\nforth with high, sprawling strides upon a career through the twilight,\nonce the main road was reached, which it taxed all Plowden's energies\nto regulate. He kept up a continual murmuring monologue to the\nanimal--“So--so--quiet, my pet,--so--so--easy, my beauty---so--so”--and\nhis wrists and gloved hands were visibly under a tremendous tension of\nstrain, as they held their own against the rigid arched neck and mouth\nof steel. Thorpe kept a grip on the side of the trap, and had only a\nmodified pleasure in the drive. The road along which they sped seemed,\nin the gathering dusk, uncomfortably narrow, and he speculated a good\ndeal as to how frightened the two mutes behind him must be. But silence\nwas such a law of their life that, though he strained his ears, he could\nnot so much as hear them sigh or gasp.\n\nIt seemed but a very few minutes before they turned off, with but the\nmost fleeting diminution of pace, upon a private road, which speedily\ndeveloped into an avenue of trees, quite dark and apparently narrower\nthan ever. Down this they raced precipitately, and then, coming out all\nat once upon an open space, swung smartly round the crescent of a gravel\nroad, and halted before what seemed to be the door of a greenhouse.\nThorpe, as he stood up in the trap, got an uncertain, general idea of a\nlow, pale-coloured mansion in the background, with lights showing behind\ncurtains in several widely separated windows; what he had taken to be a\nconservatory revealed itself now to be a glass gallery, built along the\nfront of the central portion of this house.\n\nA profusion of hospitable lights--tall wax-candles in brackets among the\nvines against the trellised wall--gave to this outlying entrance what\nthe stranger felt to be a delightful effect. Its smooth tiled floor,\ncomfortably bestrewn with rugs, was on a level with the path outside.\nThere were low easy-chairs here, and a little wicker table bearing books\nand a lady's work-basket. Further on, giant chrysanthemum blooms were\nmassed beneath the clusters of pale plumbago-flowers on the trellis.\nDirectly in front, across the dozen feet of this glazed vestibule, the\nbroad doorway of the house proper stood open--with warm lights glowing\nrichly upon dark woods in the luxurious obscurity within.\n\nWhat Thorpe noted most of all, however, was the servants who seemed to\nswarm everywhere. The two who had alighted from the trap had contrived\nsomehow mysteriously to multiply themselves in the darkness. All at once\nthere were a number of young men--at the horse's head, at the back\nand sides of the trap, at the first doorway, and the second, and\nbeyond--each presenting such a smooth-faced, pallid, brown-clad replica\nof all the others that Thorpe knew he should never be able to tell them\napart.\n\nLord Plowden paused for a moment under the candle-light to look at\nhis watch. “We did it in a bit over eight minutes,” he remarked, with\nobvious satisfaction. “With four people and heavy roads that's not so\nbad--not so bad. But come inside.”\n\nThey moved forward through the wide doorway into an apartment the like\nof which Thorpe had not seen before. It was a large, square room, with\na big staircase at the end, which separated and went off to right and\nleft, half-way up its visible course. Its floor was of inlaid woods, old\nand uneven from long use, and carpeted here and there by the skins of\ntigers and leopards. There were many other suggestions of the chase\nabout the room: riding boots, whips, spurs, and some stands of archaic\nweapons caught the eye at various points; the heads of foxes and deer\npeeped out on the blackened panels of the walls, from among clusters of\nhooks crowded with coats, hats, and mackintoshes. At the right, where a\nfire glowed and blazed under a huge open chimney-place, there were low\nchairs and divans drawn up to mark off a space for orderly domestic\noccupation. The irregularity of every thing outside--the great table in\nthe centre of the hall strewn with an incongruous litter of caps, books,\nflasks, newspapers, gloves, tobacco-pouches; the shoes, slippers,\nand leggings scattered under the benches at the sides--all this\nself-renewing disorder of a careless household struck Thorpe with a\nprofound surprise. It was like nothing so much as a Mexican ranch--and\nto find it in the ancestral home of an English nobleman, filled to\noverflowing with servants, amazed him.\n\nThe glances that he cast about him, however, were impassive enough. His\nmind was charged with the ceaseless responsibility of being astonished\nat nothing. A man took his hat, and helped him off with his coat.\nAnother moved toward the staircase with his two bags.\n\n“If you will follow Pangbourn,” said his host, indicating this second\ndomestic, “he will look after you. You would like to go up and change\nnow, wouldn't you? There's a fire in your room.”\n\nThus dismissed, he went up the stairs in the wake of his portmanteaus,\ntaking the turning to the left, and then proceeding by a long, low\npassage, round more than one corner, to what he conceived to be a wing\nof the house. The servant ushered him into a room--and, in despite of\nhimself, he sighed with pleasure at the sight of it. The prettiest and\nmost charming of rooms it seemed to him to be--spacious and quaintly\nrambling in shape, with a delicately-figured chintz repeating the dainty\neffects of the walls upon the curtains and carpet and bed-hangings and\nchair-covers, and with a bright fire in the grate throwing its warm,\ncozy glow over everything. He looked at the pictures on the walls, at\nthe photographs and little ornaments on the writing desk, and the high\nposts and silken coverlet of the big bed, and, secure in the averted\nface of the servant, smiled richly to himself.\n\nThis servant, kneeling, had unstrapped and opened the new bags. Thorpe\nlooked to see him quit the room, this task accomplished, and was\nconscious of something like dismay at the discovery that he intended to\nunpack them as well. Pangbourn began gravely to unwrap one paper parcel\nafter another and to assort their contents in little heaps on the sofa\nbeside him. He did it deftly, imperturbably, as if all the gentlemen he\nhad ever seen carried their belongings in packages done up by tradesmen.\n\nThorpe's impulse to bid him desist framed itself in words on the tip of\nhis tongue--but he did not utter these words. After circling idly, hands\nin pockets, about the man and the bags for a little time, he invented\nsomething which it seemed better for him to say.\n\n“I don't know what you'll be able to make of those things,” he remarked,\ncasually. “My man has been buying them today--and I don't know what he\nmayn't have forgotten. My whole outfit of that sort of thing went astray\nor was stolen at some station or other--the first part of the week--I\nthink it must have been Leeds.”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said Pangbourn, without emotion. “They're very careless,\nsir.”\n\nHe went on impassively, shaking out the black garments and spreading\nthem on the bed, laying out a shirt and tie beside them, and arranging\nthe razors, strop, and brushes on the dressing-table. He seemed to\nforesee everything--for there was not an instant's hesitation in the\nclock-like assiduity of his movements, as he bestowed handkerchiefs, in\none drawer, socks in another, hung pyjamas before the fire, and set\nthe patent-leather pumps against the fender. Even the old Mexican\nshooting-suit seemed in no way to disconcert him. He drew forth its\nconstituent elements as with a practised hand; when he had hung them up,\nsombrero and all, in the wardrobe against the wall, they had the\ntrick of making that venerable oaken receptacle look as if it had been\nfashioned expressly for them.\n\nThorpe's earlier uneasiness quite lost itself in his admiration for\nPangbourn's resourceful dexterity. The delighted thought that now\nhe would be needing a man like this for himself crossed his mind.\nConceivably he might even get this identical Pangbourn--treasure though\nhe were. Money could command everything on this broad globe--and why not\nPangbourn? He tentatively felt of the coins in his pocket, as it became\napparent that the man's task was nearing completion--and then frowned\nat himself for forgetting that these things were always reserved for the\nend of a visit.\n\n“Will you dress now, sir?” asked Pangbourn. His soft, distinct\nenunciation conveyed the suggestion of centuries of training.\n\n“Eh?” said Thorpe, finding himself for the moment behind the other's\nthought.\n\n“Shall you require me any further, sir?” the man reframed the question,\ndeferentially.\n\n“Oh! Oh--no,” replied Thorpe. “No--I'll get along all right.”\n\nLeft to himself, he began hurriedly the task of shaving and dressing.\nThe candles on either side of the thick, bevelled swinging mirror\npresented a somewhat embarrassing contrast to the electric light he\nwas used to--but upon second thought he preferred this restrained\naristocratic glimmer.\n\nHe had completed his toilet, and was standing at the bay-window, with\nhis shoulder holding back the edge of the curtain, looking out upon the\ndarkened lawn and wondering whether he ought to go downstairs or wait\nfor someone to summon him, when he heard a knock at his door. Before\nhe could answer, the door opened, and he made out in the candle-and\nfirelight that it was Lord Plowden who had come in. He stepped forward\nto meet his host who, clad now in evening-clothes, was smoking a\ncigarette.\n\n“Have they looked after you all right?” said Plowden, nonchalantly.\n“Have a cigarette before we go down? Light it by the candle. They never\nwill keep matches in a bedroom.”\n\nHe seated himself in an easy-chair before the fire, as he spoke, and\nstretched out his shining slippers toward the grate. “I thought I'd tell\nyou before we went down”--he went on, as Thorpe, with an elbow on the\nmantel, looked down at his handsome head--“my sister has a couple of\nladies visiting her. One of them I think you know. Do you remember on\nshipboard a Miss Madden--an American, you know--very tall and fine, with\nbright red hair--rather remarkable hair it was?”\n\n“I remember the lady,” said Thorpe, upon reflection, “but we didn't\nmeet.” He could not wholly divest his tone of the hint that in those\ndays it by no means followed that because he saw ladies it was open to\nhim to know them.\n\nLord Plowden smiled a little. “Oh, you'll like her. She's great fun--if\nshe's in the mood. My mother and sister--I had them call on her in\nLondon last spring--and they took a great fancy to her. She's got no\nend of money, you know--at least a million and a half--dollars,\nunfortunately. Her parents were Irish--her father made his pile in the\nwaggon business, I believe--but she's as American as if they'd crossed\nover in--what was it, the 'Sunflower'?--no, the 'Mayflower.' Marvelous\ncountry for assimilation, that America is! You remember what I told\nyou--it's put such a mark on you that I should never have dreamt you\nwere English.”\n\nThorpe observed his companion, through a blue haze of smoke, in silence.\nThis insistence upon the un-English nature of the effect he produced was\nnot altogether grateful to his ears.\n\n“The other one,” continued Plowden, “is Lady Cressage. You'll be\ninterested in her--because a few years ago she was supposed to be the\nmost beautiful woman in London. She married a shocking bounder--he\nwould have been Duke of Glastonbury, though, if he had lived--but he was\ndrowned, and she was left poor as a church mouse. Oh! by the way!” he\nstarted up, with a gleam of aroused interest on his face--“it didn't in\nthe least occur to me. Why, she's a daughter of our General Kervick. How\ndid he get on the Board, by the way? Where did you pick him up?”\n\nThorpe bent his brows in puzzled lines. “Why, you introduced me to him\nyourself, didn't you?” he asked, slowly.\n\nPlowden seemed unaffectedly surprised at the suggestion, as he turned it\nover in his mind. “By George! I think you're right,” he said. “I'd quite\nforgotten it. Of course I did. Let me see--oh yes, I reconstruct it\nreadily enough now. Poor old chappie--he needs all he can get. He was\nbothering her about money--that was it, I remember now--but what an\nidiot I was to forget it. But what I was saying--there's no one else but\nmy mother and sister, and my brother Balder. He's a youngster--twenty or\nthereabouts--and he purports to be reading for his exams for the Army.\nIf they opened his head, though, I doubt if they'd find anything but\ncricket and football, unless it might be a bit of golf. Well--that's the\nparty. I thought you might like to have a notion of them in advance. If\nyou've finished your cigarette”--he threw his own into the grate, and\nrose as he spoke--“we may as well be moving along. By the way,” he\nconcluded, as they walked toward the door, “I've an idea that we won't\nsay anything, just at the moment, about our great coup. I should like to\nkeep it as a little surprise--for my mother and sister, you know.”\n\nSome two hours later, Thorpe found the leisure and the restored\nequanimity needful for a dispassionate survey of his surroundings. He\nhad become temporarily detached from the group over by the fireplace in\nthe big drawing-room and was for the first time that evening very much\nat his ease. It was all much simpler, upon experiment, than he had\nfeared. He stood now in a corner of the ornate apartment, whither he had\nwandered in examining the pictures on the walls, and contemplated with\nserenity the five people whom he had left behind him. He was conscious\nof the conviction that when he rejoined them, it would be on a\nnew footing of assured equality. He knew now the exact measure of\neverything.\n\nThe Hon. Balder Plowden--a tall, heavily-built youth, with enormous\nshoulders and thick, hard hands, and pale straw-coloured hair and brows\nand eyelashes--had amiably sauntered beside him, and was elucidating for\nhis benefit now, in slow, halting undertones, some unfathomable mystery\nconnected with the varying attitude of two distinct breeds of terriers\ntoward rats. Across the room, just within reach of the flickering ruddy\nfirelight from the hearth, the American guest, Miss Madden, was seated\nat the piano, playing some low and rather doleful music. Thorpe bent\nhis head, and assumed an air of attention, but in truth he listened\nto neither the Honourable Balder nor the piano. His thoughts were\nconcentrated jealously upon his own position in this novel setting. He\nsaid to himself that it was all right. Old Lady Plowden had seemed\nto like him from the start. The genial, if somewhat abstracted,\nmotherliness of her welcome had been, indeed, his sheet anchor\nthroughout the evening. She had not once failed to nod her head and\nsmile and twinkle her little kind eyes through their spectacles at him,\nwhenever by word or look he had addressed her. Nor did his original\nhalf-suspicion, that this was her manner to people in general, justify\nitself upon observation. She was civil, even excessively civil, to the\nother two guests, but these ladies did not get the same eager and intent\nsmile that he could command. He reasoned it out that Plowden must have\nsaid something pleasant to his mother about him--perhaps even to\nthe point of explaining that he was to be the architect of their\nfortunes--but he did not like to ascribe all her hospitable warmth\nto that. It was dear to him to believe that she liked him on his own\nmerits--and he did believe it, as his softened glance rested upon her\nwhere she sat almost facing him in her padded, wicker chair--small,\nwhite-haired, rosy-cheeked, her intelligent face radiating a kind of\nalert placidity which somehow made him feel at home.\n\nHe had not been as much at home with the others. The Honourable Balder,\nof course, didn't count; nobody paid attention to him, and least of all\na busy Rubber King. He gave not much more heed to the American--the tall\nyoung woman with the red hair and the million and a half of dollars. She\nwas plainly a visitor like himself, not at all identified with the inner\nlife of the household. He fancied, moreover, that she in no way desired\nto be thus identified. She seemed to carry herself with a deliberate\naloofness underlying her surface amiability. Then he had spoken his few\nwords with her, once or twice, he had got this effect of stony reserve\nclose beneath her smile and smooth words. True, this might mean only\nthat she felt herself out of her element, just as he did--but to him,\nreally it did not matter what she felt. A year ago--why, yes, even a\nfortnight ago--the golden rumour of millions would have shone round\nher auburn hair in his eyes like a halo. But all that was changed.\nCalculated in a solidified currency, her reported fortune shrank to a\nmere three hundred thousand pounds. It was a respectable sum for a woman\nto have, no doubt, but it did nothing to quicken the cool indifference\nwith which he considered her.\n\nThe two other young women were different. They were seated together on a\nsofa, so placed as regarded his point of view, that he saw only in\npart the shadowed profiles of the faces they turned toward the piano.\nAlthough it was not visible to him, the posture of their shoulders told\nhim that they were listening to the music each holding the other's\nhand. This tacit embrace was typical in his mind of the way they hung\ntogether, these two young women. It had been forced upon his perceptions\nall the evening, that this fair-haired, beautiful, rather stately Lady\nCressage, and the small, swarthy, round-shouldered daughter of the\nhouse, peering through her pince-nez from under unduly thick black\nbrows, formed a party of their own. Their politeness toward him had been\nas identical in all its little shades of distance and reservation as if\nthey had been governed from a single brain-centre. It would be unfair\nto them to assume from their manner that they disliked him, or were even\nunfavourably impressed by him. The finesse of that manner was far too\ndelicate a thing to call into use such rough characterizations. It was\nrather their action as a unit which piqued his interest. He thought he\ncould see that they united upon a common demeanour toward the American\ngirl, although of course they knew her much better than they knew\nhim. It was not even clear to him that there were not traces of this\ncombination in their tone toward Plowden and the Honourable Balder. The\nbond between them had twisted in it strands of social exclusiveness, and\nstrands of sex sympathy.\n\nHe did not analyze all this with much closeness in his thoughts, but the\nimpressions of it were distinct enough to him. He rather enjoyed\nthese impressions than otherwise. Women had not often interested him\nconsecutively to any large degree, either in detail or as a whole. He\nhad formulated, among other loose general notions of them, however, the\nidea that their failure to stand by one another was one of their gravest\nweaknesses. This proposition rose suddenly now in his mind, and claimed\nhis attention. It became apparent to him, all at once, that his opinions\nabout women would be henceforth invested with a new importance. He had\nscarcely before in his life worn evening dress in a domestic circle\nwhich included ladies--certainly never in the presence of such\ncertificated and hall-marked ladies as these. His future, however,\nwas to be filled with experiences of this nature. Already, after this\nbriefest of ventures into the new life, he found fresh conceptions of\nthe great subject springing up in his thoughts. In this matter of women\nsticking together, for example--here before his eyes was one of the\nprettiest instances of it imaginable. As he looked again at the two\nfigures on the sofa, so markedly unlike in outward aspect, yet knit\nto each other in such a sisterly bond, he found the spectacle really\ntouching.\n\nLady Cressage had inclined her classic profile even more toward the\npiano. Thorpe was not stirred at all by the music, but the spirit of\nit as it was reflected upon this beautiful facial outline--sensitive,\nhigh-spirited, somewhat sad withal--appealed to something in him. He\nmoved forward cautiously, noiselessly, a dozen restricted paces,\nand halted again at the corner of a table. It was a relief that the\nHonourable Balder, though he followed along, respected now his obvious\nwish for silence. But neither Balder nor anyone else could guess that\nthe music said less than nothing to his ears--that it was the face that\nhad beckoned him to advance.\n\nCovertly, with momentary assurances that no one observed him, he studied\nthis face and mused upon it. The white candle-light on the shining wall\nbeyond threw everything into a soft, uniform shadow, this side of the\nthread of dark tracery which outlined forehead and nose and lips and\nchin. It seemed to him that the eyes were closed, as in reverie; he\ncould not be sure.\n\nSo she would have been a Duchess if her husband had lived! He said\nto himself that he had never seen before, or imagined, a face which\nbelonged so indubitably beneath a tiara of strawberry leaves in\ndiamonds. The pride and grace and composure, yes, and melancholy, of\nthe great lady--they were all there in their supreme expression. And\nyet--why, she was no great lady at all. She was the daughter of his\nold General Kervick--the necessitous and haughtily-humble old military\ngentleman, with the grey moustache and the premature fur coat, who did\nwhat he was told on the Board without a question, for a pitiful three\nhundred a year. Yes--she was his daughter, and she also was poor.\nPlowden had said so.\n\nWhy had Plowden, by the way, been so keen about relieving her from her\nfather's importunities? He must have had it very much at heart, to\nhave invented the roundabout plan of getting the old gentleman a\ndirectorship. But no--there was nothing in that. Why, Plowden had even\nforgotten that it was he who suggested Kervick's name. It would have\nbeen his sister, of course, who was evidently such chums with Lady\nCressage, who gave him the hint to help the General to something if he\ncould. And when you came to think of it, these aristocrats and\nmilitary men and so on, had no other notion of making money save by\ndirectorships. Clearly, that was the way of it. Plowden had remembered\nKervick's name, when the chance arose to give the old boy a leg up, and\nthen had clean forgotten the circumstance. The episode rather increased\nhis liking for Plowden.\n\nHe glanced briefly, under the impulse of his thought, to where the peer\nsat, or rather sprawled, in a big low chair before the fire. He was so\nnearly recumbent in it, indeed, that there was nothing to be seen of\nhim but an elbow, and two very trim legs extended to the brass fender.\nThorpe's gaze reverted automatically to the face of General Kervick's\ndaughter. He wondered if she knew about the Company, and about him,\nand about his ability to solidify to any extent her father's financial\nposition. Even more, upon reflection, he wondered whether she was very\nfond of her father; would she be extremely grateful to one who should\nrender him securely comfortable for life? Miss Madden rose from the\npiano before Thorpe noted that the music had ceased. There came from\nthe others a soft but fervent chorus of exclamations, the sincerity and\nenthusiasm of which made him a little ashamed. He had evidently been\ndeaf to something that deeply moved the rest. Even Balder made remarks\nwhich seemed to be regarded as apposite.\n\n“What IS it?” asked Lady Cressage, with obvious feeling. “I don't know\nwhen anything has touched me so much.”\n\n“Old Danish songs that I picked up on the quai in Paris for a franc or\ntwo,” replied Miss Madden. “I arranged and harmonized them--and, oddly\nenough, the result is rather Keltic, don't you think?”\n\n“We are all of us Kelts in our welcome to music--and musicians--like\nthis,” affirmed Lord Plowden, who had scrambled to his feet.\n\nWith sudden resolution, Thorpe moved forward and joined the\nconversation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nTHORPE'S life-long habit of early rising brought him downstairs next\nmorning before anybody else in the house, apparently, was astir. At all\nevents, he saw no one in either the hall or the glass vestibule, as he\nwandered about. Both doors were wide open, however, to the mild,\ndamp morning air. He found on one of the racks a cap that was less\nuncomfortable than the others, and sauntered forth to look about him.\n\nHis nerves were by no means in so serene a state as his reason told him\nthey ought to be. The disquieting impression of bad dreams hung about\nhim. The waking hour--always an evil time for him in these latter days\nof anxiety--had been this morning a peculiarly depressing affair. It had\nseemed to him, in the first minutes of reviving consciousness, that he\nwas a hopelessly ruined and discredited man; the illusion of disaster\nhad been, indeed, so complete and vivid that, even now, more than an\nhour later, he had not shaken off its effects.\n\nHe applied his mental energies, as he strolled along the gravel paths,\nto the task of reassuring himself. There were still elements of chance\nin the game, of course, but it was easy enough, here in the daylight,\nto demonstrate that they had been cut down to a minimum--that it was\nnonsense to borrow trouble about them. He reviewed the situation in\npainstaking detail, and at every point it was all right, or as nearly\nall right as any human business could be. He scolded himself sharply for\nthis foolish susceptibility to the intimidation of nightmares. “Look at\nPlowden!” he bade his dolorous spirit. “See how easy he takes things.”\n\nIt was undeniable that Lord Plowden took things very easily indeed.\nHe had talked with eloquence and feeling about the miseries and\nhumiliations of a peerage inadequately endowed with money, but no traces\nof his sufferings were visible to Thorpe's observant eye. The nobleman\nhimself looked the very image of contented prosperity--handsome,\nbuoyant, light-hearted, and, withal, the best-groomed man in London.\nAnd this ancestral home of his--or of his mother's, since he seemed to\ninsist upon the distinction--where were its signs of a stinted income?\nThe place was overrun with servants. There was a horse which covered a\ndistance of something like two miles in eight minutes. Inside and out,\nHadlow House suggested nothing but assured plenty. Yet its master told\nthe most unvarying tales of poverty, and no doubt they were in one sense\ntrue. What he wished to fix his mind upon, and to draw strength for\nhimself from, was the gay courage with which these Plowdens behaved as\nif they were rich.\n\nThe grounds at the front of the house, hemmed in by high hedges and\ntrees from what seemed to be a public road beyond, were fairly spacious,\nbut the sleek decorum of their arrangement, while it pleased him, was\nscarcely interesting. He liked better to study the house itself, which\nin the daylight revealed itself as his ideal of what a historic English\ncountry-house of the minor class should be.\n\nThere had been a period in his youth when architecture had attracted him\ngreatly as offering a congenial and lucrative career. Not much remained\nto him now of the classifications and phraseology which he had gone to\nthe trouble of memorizing, in that far-off time, but he still looked at\nbuildings with a kind of professional consciousness. Hadlow House\nsaid intelligible things to him, and he was pleased with himself for\nunderstanding them. It was not new in any part, apparently, but there\nwas nothing pretentious in its antiquity. It had never been a castle,\nor a fortified residence. No violent alteration in habits or needs\ndistinguished its present occupants from its original builders. It\nhad been planned and reared as a home for gentle people, at some\nnot-too-remote date when it was already possible for gentle people to\nhave homes, without fighting to defend them. One could fancy that its\ncalm and infinitely comfortable history had never been ruffled from that\nday to this. He recalled having heard it mentioned the previous evening\nthat the house stood upon the site of an old monastery. No doubt that\naccounted for its being built in a hollow, with the ground-floor on the\nabsolute level of the earth outside. The monks had always chosen these\nlow-lying sheltered spots for their cloisters. Why should they have done\nso? he wondered--and then came to a sudden mental stop, absorbed in a\nsomewhat surprised contemplation of a new version of himself. He was\nbecoming literary, historical, bookish! His mind had begun to throw open\nagain, to abstract thoughts and musings, its long-closed doors. He had\nread and dreamed so much as a lad, in the old book-shop! For many years\nthat boyhood of eager concern in the printed page had seemed to him to\nbelong to somebody else. Now, all at once, it came back to him as his\nown possession; he felt that he could take up books again where he had\ndropped them, perhaps even with the old rapt, intent zest.\n\nVisions rose before him of the magnificent library he would gather for\nhimself. And it should be in no wise for show--the gross ostentation of\nthe unlettered parvenu--but a genuine library, which should minister\nto his own individual culture. The thought took instant hold upon his\ninterest. By that road, his progress to the goal of gentility would be\nsmooth and simple. He seemed not to have reasoned it out to himself in\ndetail before, but now, at all events, he saw his way clearly enough.\nWhy should he be tormented with doubts and misgivings about himself, as\nif he had come out of the gutter?\n\nWhy indeed? He had passed through--and with credit, too--one of the\ngreat public schools of England. He had been there on a footing of\nperfect equality, so far as he saw, with the sons of aristocratic\nfamilies or of great City potentates. And as to birth, he had behind him\nthree generations at least of scholarly men, men who knew the contents,\nas well as the commercial value, of the books they handled.\n\nHis grandfather had been a man of note in his calling. The tradition of\nLord Althorp's confidence in him, and of how he requited it by\nsecuring Caxton's “Golden Legend” for the library of that distinguished\ncollector, under the very nose of his hot rival, the Duke of\nMarlborough, was tenderly cherished as an heirloom in the old shop.\nAnd Thorpe's father, too, though no such single achievement crowned his\nmemory, had been the adviser and, as one might say, the friend of many\nnotable writers and patrons of literature. The son of such forbears\nneeded only money to be recognized by everybody as a gentleman.\n\nOn his mother's side, now that he thought of it, there was something\nperhaps better still than a heritage of librarians' craft and tastes.\nHis mother's maiden name was Stormont, and he remembered well enough the\nsolemnity with which she had always alluded to the fact, in the course\nof domestic discussions. Who the Stormonts were he could not recall that\nhe had ever learned, but his mother had been very clear indeed about\ntheir superiority to the usual ruck of people. He would ask his sister\nwhether she knew anything about them. In the meantime there was no\ndenying that Stormont was a fine-sounding name. He reflected that it\nwas his own middle name--and, on the instant, fancy engraved for him a\ncard-plate on which appeared the legend--“Mr. Stormont Thorpe.”\n\nIt was an inspiration! “Joel” he had not used for so many years that now,\nafter six months' familiarity with it on his sister's lips, he could not\nget accustomed to it. The colourless and non-committal style of “J. S.\nThorpe,” under which he had lived so long, had been well enough for the\nterm of his exile--the weary time of obscure toil and suspense. But now,\nin this sunburst of smiling fortune, when he had achieved the right to a\nname of distinction--here it was ready to his hand. A fleeting question\nas to whether he should carry the “J” along as an initial put itself\nto his mind. He decided vigorously against it. He had always had a\nprejudice against men who, in the transatlantic phrase, parted either\ntheir hair or their names in the middle.\n\nHe had made his unheeding way past the house to the beginning of the\navenue of trees, which he remembered from the previous evening's drive.\nTo his right, an open space of roadway led off in the direction of the\nstables. As he hesitated, in momentary doubt which course to take, the\nsound of hoofs in the avenue caught his ear, and he stood still. In a\nmoment there came into view, round a curve in the leafy distance, two\nhorses with riders, advancing at a brisk canter. Soon he perceived that\nthe riders were ladies; they drew rein as they approached him, and then\nit was to be seen that they were the pair he had judged to be such close\nfriends last night--Lady Cressage and the daughter of the house.\n\nThey smiled and nodded down at him, as he lifted his cap and bowed.\nTheir cheeks were glowing and their eyes sparkling with the exhilaration\nof their ride. Even the Hon. Winifred looked comely and distinguished\nin his eyes, under the charm of this heightened vivacity. She seemed to\ncarry herself better in the saddle than she did out of it; the sweep of\nher habit below the stirrup lent dignity to her figure.\n\nBut her companion, whose big chestnut mount was pacing slowly toward the\nstepping-block--how should he bring within the compass of thought the\nimpressions he had had of her as she passed? There seemed to have been\nno memory in his mind to prepare him for the beauty of the picture she\nhad made. Slender, erect, exquisitely-tailored, she had gone by like\nsome queen in a pageant, gracious yet unapproachable. He stared after\nher, mutely bewildered at the effect she produced upon him--until he saw\nthat a groom had run from the stable-yard, and was helping the divinity\nto dismount. The angry thought that he might have done this himself rose\nwithin him--but there followed swiftly enough the answering conviction\nthat he lacked the courage. He did not even advance to proffer his\nservices to the other young lady, while there was still time. The truth\nwas, he admitted ruefully to himself, they unnerved him.\n\nHe had talked freely enough to them, or rather to the company of which\nthey made part, the previous evening. There had been an hour or more,\nindeed, before the party broke up, in which he had borne the lion's\nshare of the talk--and they had appeared as frankly entertained as the\nothers. In fact, when he recalled the circle of faces to which he\nhad addressed his monologue of reminiscences--curious experiences and\nadventures in Java and the Argentine, in Brazil and the Antilles and\nMexico and the far West--it was in the face of Lady Cressage that he\nseemed to discern the most genuine interest.\n\nWhy should she frighten him, then, by daylight? The whimsical theory\nthat the wine at dinner had given him a spurious courage occurred\nto him. He shrugged his shoulders at it, and, with his hands in his\npockets, turned toward the stables.\n\nThe stable-yard is, from some points of view, the prettiest thing about\nHadlow. There is a big, uneven, grass-grown space, in the centre of\nwhich, from a slight mound, springs an aged oak of tremendous girth\nand height. All around this enclosure are buildings of the same pale\nyellowish brick as the mansion itself, but quaintly differing one\nfrom another in design and size. Stables, carriage-houses, kennels, a\nlaundry, a brewery, and half a dozen structures the intention of which\nis now somewhat uncertain--some flat-topped, some gabled, others with\nturrets, or massive grouped chimneys, or overhanging timbered upper\nstories--form round this unkempt, shadowed green a sort of village, with\na communal individuality of its own.\n\nA glance shows its feudal relation to, and dependence upon, the great\nhouse behind which it nestles; some of the back-kitchens and offices\nof this great house, indeed, straggle out till they meet and merge\nthemselves into this quadrangle. None the less, it presents to the\nenquiring gaze a specific character, of as old a growth, one might\nthink, as the oak itself. Here servants have lived, it may be, since\nman first learned the trick of setting his foot on his brother's neck.\nPlainly enough, the monks' servants lived and worked here; half the\nbuildings on the side nearest the house belong to their time, and one\nof them still bears a partially-defaced coat of arms that must have\nbelonged to an Abbot. And when lay lord succeeded cleric, only the garb\nand vocabulary of servitude were altered in this square. Its population\ncrossed themselves less, and worked much harder, but they remained in a\nworld of their own, adjacent aud subject to the world of their masters,\nyet separated from it by oh! such countless and unthinkable distances.\n\nThorpe sauntered along the side of the stables. He counted three men\nand a boy who visibly belonged to this department. The dog-cart of the\nprevious evening had been run out upon the brick-pavement which drained\nthe stables, and glistened with expensive smartness now beneath the\nsponge of one of the hostlers. Under cover, he discerned two other\ncarriages, and there seemed to be at least half a dozen horses. The\nmen who, in the half gloom of the loose-boxes, were busy grooming these\nanimals made a curious whistling noise as they worked. Everybody in the\nyard touched a forelock to him as he passed.\n\nFrom this quaint, old-world enclosure he wandered at his leisure,\nthrough an open gate in the wall at the back, into the gardens behind\nthe house. There was not much in the way of flowers to look at, but\nhe moved about quite unconscious of any deprivation. A cluster of\ngreenhouses, massed against the southern side of the mansion, attracted\nhis listless fancy, and he walked toward what appeared to be an entrance\nto them. The door was locked, but he found another further on which\nopened to his hand. The air was very hot and moist inside, and the place\nwas so filled with broad-leaved, umbrageous tropical plants that he had\nto stoop to make his way through to the end. The next house had a more\ntolerable atmosphere, and contained some blossoms to which he gave\nmomentary attention. In the third house, through the glass-door, he\ncould see a man--evidently a gardener--lifting some pots to a shelf\noverhead.\n\nThe thought occurred to him that by entering into conversation with this\nman, he might indirectly obtain a hint as to the usual breakfast-hour at\nHadlow. It was now nearly ten o'clock, and he was getting very hungry.\nWould they not ring a bell, or sound a gong, or something? he wondered.\nPerhaps there had been some such summons, and he had not heard it. It\nmight be the intelligent thing for him to return to the house, at all\nevents, and sit in the hall where the servants could see him, in case\nthe meal was in progress.\n\nLooking idly through the glass at the gardener, meanwhile, it suddenly\ndawned upon him that the face and figure were familiar. He stared more\nintently at the man, casting about in his memory for a clue to his\nidentity. It came to him that the person he had in mind was a fellow\nnamed Gafferson, who had kept an impoverished and down-at-the-heels\nsort of hotel and general store on the road from Belize to Boon Town, in\nBritish Honduras. Yes, it undoubtedly was Gafferson. What on earth was\nhe doing here? Thorpe gave but brief consideration to this problem.\nIt was of more immediate importance to recall the circumstances of his\ncontact with the man. He had made Gafferson's poor shanty of an hotel\nhis headquarters for the better part of a month--the base of supplies\nfrom which he made numerous prospecting tours into the mountains of the\ninterior. Had he paid his bill on leaving? Yes, there was no doubt about\nthat. He could even recall a certain pity for the unbusiness-like\nscale of charges, and the lack of perception of opportunity, which\ncharacterized the bill in question. He remembered now his impression\nthat Gafferson would never do any good. It would be interesting to know\nwhat kind of an impression he, in turn, had produced on his thriftless\nhost. At any rate, there was no good reason why he should not find out.\nHe opened the door and went in.\n\nThe gardener barely looked up from his occupation, and drew aside to\nlet the newcomer pass with no sign of a gesture toward his cap. Thorpe\nhalted, and tried to look at the pots on the staging as if he knew about\nsuch things.\n\n“What are you doing?” he asked, in the tentative tone of one who is in\nno need of information, but desires to be affable.\n\n“Drying off the first lot of gloxinias,” answered the other. “Some\npeople put 'em on their sides, but I like 'em upright, close to the\nglass. It stands to reason, if you think about it.”\n\n“Why, certainly,” said Thorpe, with conviction. In his mind he\ncontrasted the independence of Gafferson's manner with the practised\nservility of the stable-yard--and thought that he liked it--and then\nwas not so sure. He perceived that there was no recognition of him. The\ngardener, as further desultory conversation about his work progressed,\nlooked his interlocutor full in the face, but with a placid, sheep-like\ngaze which seemed to be entirely insensible to variations in the human\nspecies.\n\n“How did you ever get back here to England?” Thorpe was emboldened to\nask at last. In comment upon the other's stare of puzzled enquiry, he\nwent on: “You're Gafferson, aren't you? I thought so. When I last saw\nyou, you were running a sort of half-way house, t'other side of Belize.\nThat was in '90.”\n\nGafferson--a thick-set, squat man of middle age, with a straggling\nreddish beard--turned upon him a tranquil but uninformed eye. “I suppose\nyou would have been stopping at Government House,” he remarked. “That\nwas in Sir Roger Goldsworthy's time. They used to come out often to see\nmy flowers. And so you remembered my name. I suppose it was because of\nthe Gaffersoniana hybrids. There was a good bit in the papers about them\nlast spring.” Thorpe nodded an assent which it seemed better not to put\ninto words. “Well, it beats all,” he mused aloud. “Why, man, there's\ngold in those mountains! You had an inside track on prospecting, placed\nas you were. And there's cocoa--and some day they'll coin money in\nrubber, too. All that country's waiting for is better communications.\nAnd you were on the spot, and knew all the lay of the land--and yet here\nyou are back in England, getting so much a month for messing about in\nthe mud.”\n\nHe saw swiftly that his reflections had carried him beyond his earlier\nlimit, and with rapidity decided upon frankness. “No, I wasn't in the\nGovernor's outfit at all. I was looking for gold then--with occasionally\nan eye on rubber. I stopped at your place. Don't you remember me? My\nname's Thorpe. I had a beard then. Why, man, you and one of your niggers\nwere with me three or four days once, up on the ridge beyond the Burnt\nHills--why, you remember, the nigger was from San Domingo, and he was\nforever bragging about the San Domingo peppers, and saying those on the\nmainland hadn't enough strength to make a baby wrinkle his nose, and you\nfound a pepper coming through the swamp, and you tipped me the wink,\nand you handed that pepper to the nigger, and it damned near killed him.\nHell! You must remember that!”\n\n“That would have been the Chavica pertusum,” said Gafferson,\nthoughtfully. He seemed to rouse himself to an interest in the story\nitself with some difficulty. “Yes--I remember it,” he admitted, finally.\n“I shouldn't have known you though. I'm the worst in the world about\nremembering people. It seems to be growing on me. I notice that when I\ngo up to London to the shows, I don't remember the men that I had the\nlongest talks with the time before. Once you get wrapped up in your\nflowers, you've got no room in your head for anything else--that's the\nway of it.”\n\nThorpe considered him with a ruminating eye. “So this is the sort of\nthing you really like, eh? You'd rather be doing this, eh? than making\nyour pile in logwood and mahogany out there, or floating a gold mine?”\n Gafferson answered quite simply: “I wasn't the kind to ever make a pile.\nI got led into going out there when I was a youngster, and there didn't\nseem to be any good in trying to get back, but I wasn't making more than\na bare living when you were there, and after that I didn't even do that\nmuch. It took me a good many years to find out what my real fancy was. I\nhated my hotel and my store, but I was crazy about my garden. Finally an\nAmerican gentleman came along one day, and he put up at my place, and\nhe saw that I was as near ruined as they make 'em, and he says to me,\n'You're no good to run a hotel, nor yet a store, and this aint your\ncountry for a cent. What you're born for is to grow flowers. You can't\nafford to do it here, because nobody'll pay you for it, but you gather\nup your seeds and roots and so on, and come along with me to Atlanta,\nGeorgia, and I'll put fat on your bones.'\n\n“That's what he said to me, and I took him at his word, and I was with\nhim two years, and then I thought I'd like to come to England, and since\nthen I've worked my way up here, till now I take a Royal Horticultural\nmedal regular, and there's a clematis with salmon-coloured bars that'll\nbe in the market next spring that's named after my master. And what\ncould I ask more 'n that?”\n\n“Quite right,” said Thorpe. “What time do they have breakfast here?”\n\nThe gardener's round, phlegmatic, florid countenance had taken on a mild\nglow of animation during his narrative. It relapsed into lethargy at the\nadvent of this new topic.\n\n“It seems to me they eat at all hours,” he said. “But if you want to see\nhis Lordship,” he went on, considering, “about noon would be your best\ntime.”\n\n“See his Lordship!” repeated Thorpe, with an impatient grin. “Why I'm a\nguest here in the house. All I want is something to eat.”\n\n“A guest,” Gafferson repeated in turn, slowly. There was nothing\nunpleasant in the intonation, and Thorpe's sharp glance failed to detect\nany trace of offensive intention in his companion's fatuous visage. Yet\nit seemed to pass between the two men that Gafferson was surprised, and\nthat there were abundant grounds for his surprise.\n\n“Why, yes,” said Thorpe, with as much nonchalance as he could summon,\n“your master is one of my directors. I've taken a fancy to him, and I'm\ngoing to make a rich man of him. He was keen about my seeing his place\nhere, and kept urging me to come, and so finally I've got away over\nSunday to oblige him. By the way--I shall buy an estate in the country\nas soon as the right thing offers, and I shall want to set up no end of\ngardens and greenhouses and all that. I see that I couldn't come to a\nbetter man than you for advice. I daresay I'll put the whole arrangement\nof it in your hands. You'd like that, wouldn't you?”\n\n“Whatever his Lordship agrees to,” the gardener replied, sententiously.\nHe turned to the staging, and took up one of the pots.\n\nThorpe swung on his heel, and moved briskly toward the further door,\nwhich he could see opened upon the lawn. He was conscious of annoyance\nwith this moon-faced, dawdling Gafferson, who had been afforded such a\nsplendid chance of profiting by an old acquaintanceship--it might even\nbe called, as things went in Honduras, a friendship--and who had so\nclumsily failed to rise to the situation. The bitter thought of going\nback and giving him a half-crown rose in Thorpe's inventive mind, and he\npaused for an instant, his hand on the door-knob, to think it over. The\ngratuity would certainly put Gafferson in his place, but then the spirit\nin which it was offered would be wholly lost on his dull brain. And\nmoreover, was it so certain that he would take it? He had not said “sir”\n once, and he had talked about medals with the pride of a scientist. The\nrules were overwhelmingly against a gardener rejecting a tip, of course,\nbut if there was no more than one chance in twenty of it, Thorpe decided\nthat he could not afford the risk.\n\nHe quitted the greenhouse with resolution, and directed his steps toward\nthe front of the mansion. As he entered the hall, a remarkably tuneful\nand resonant chime filled his ears with novel music. He looked and saw\nthat a white-capped, neatly-clad domestic, standing with her back to him\nbeside the newel-post of the stairs, was beating out the tune with two\npadded sticks upon some strips of metal ranged on a stand of Indian\nworkmanship. The sound was delightful, but even more so was the\nimplication that it betokened breakfast.\n\nWith inspiration, he drew forth the half-crown which he had been\nfingering in his pocket, and gave it to the girl as she turned. “That's\nthe kind of concert I like,” he declared, bestowing the patronage of a\njovial smile upon her pleased and comely face. “Show me the way to this\nbreakfast that you've been serenading about.”\n\nOut in the greenhouse, meanwhile, Gafferson continued to regard blankly\nthe shrivelled, fatty leaves of the plant he had taken up. “Thorpe,”\n he said aloud, as if addressing the tabid gloxinia--“Thorpe--yes--I\nremember his initials--J. S. Thorpe. Now, who's the man that told me\nabout him? and what was it he told me?”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nTHE experiences of the breakfast room were very agreeable indeed. Thorpe\nfound himself the only man present, and, after the first few minutes of\nembarrassment at this discovery, it filled him with surprised delight\nto note how perfectly he was at his ease. He could never have imagined\nhimself seated with four ladies at a table--three of them, moreover,\nladies of title--and doing it all so well.\n\nFor one thing, the ladies themselves had a morning manner, so to\nspeak, which differed widely from the impressions he had had of their\ndeportment the previous evening. They seemed now to be as simple and\nfresh and natural as the unadorned frocks they wore. They listened with\nan air of good-fellowship to him when he spoke; they smiled at the right\nplaces; they acted as if they liked him, and were glad of his company.\n\nThe satisfied conviction that he was talking well, and behaving well,\naccompanied him in his progress through the meal. His confession at the\noutset of his great hunger, and of the sinister apprehensions which\nhad assailed him in his loitering walk about the place, proved a most\nfortuitous beginning; after that, they were ready to regard everything\nhe said as amusing.\n\n“Oh, when we're by ourselves,” the kindly little old hostess explained\nto him, “my daughter and I breakfast always at nine. That was our hour\nyesterday morning, for example. But when my son is here, then it's\nfarewell to regularity. We put breakfast back till ten, then, as a kind\nof compromise between our own early habits and his lack of any sort of\nhabits. Why we do it I couldn't say--because he never comes down in any\nevent. He sleeps so well at Hadlow--and you know in town he sleeps\nvery ill indeed--and so we don't dream of complaining. We're only too\nglad--for his sake.”\n\n“And Balder,” commented the sister, “he's as bad the other way. He\ngets up at some unearthly hour, and has his tea and a sandwich from the\nstill-room, and goes off with his rod or his gun or the dogs, and we\nnever see him till luncheon.”\n\n“I've been on the point of asking so many times,” Miss Madden\ninterposed--“is Balder a family name, or is it after the Viking in\nMatthew Arnold's poem?”\n\n“It was his father's choice,” Lady Plowden made answer. “I think the\nViking explanation is the right one--it certainly isn't in either\nfamily. I can't say that it attracted me much--at first, you know.”\n\n“Oh, but it fits him so splendidly,” said Lady Cressage. “He looks the\npart, as they say. I always thought it was the best of all the soldier\nnames--and you have only to look at him to see that he was predestined\nfor a soldier from his cradle.”\n\n“I wish the Sandhurst people would have a good long look at him, then,”\n put in the mother with earnestness underlying the jest of her tone. “The\npoor boy will never pass those exams in the world. It IS ridiculous,\nas his father always said. If there ever was a man who was made for a\nsoldier, it's Balder. He's a gentleman, and he's connected by tradition\nwith the Army, and he's mad about everything military--and surely he's\nas clever as anybody else at everything except that wretched matter\nof books, and even there it's only a defect of memory--and yet that\nsuffices to prevent his serving his Queen. And all over England there\nare young gentlemen like that--the very pick of the hunting-fields,\nstrong and brave as lions, fit to lead men anywhere, the very men\nEngland wants to have fighting her battles--and they can't get places\nin the Army because--what was it Balder came to grief over last\ntime?--because they can't remember whether it's Ispahan or Teheran\nthat's the capital of Persia.\n\n“They are the fine old sort that would go and capture both places at the\npoint of the bayonet--and find out their names afterward--but it seems\nthat's not what the Army wants nowadays. What is desired now is superior\nclerks, and secretaries and professors of languages--and much good they\nwill do us when the time of trouble comes!”\n\n“Then you think the purchase-system was better?” asked the American\nlady. “It always seemed to me that that must have worked so curiously.”\n\n“Prefer it?” said Lady Plowden. “A thousand times yes! My husband made\none of the best speeches in the debate on it--one do I say?--first and\nlast he must have made a dozen of them. If anything could have kept\nthe House of Lords firm, in the face of the wretched Radical outcry, it\nwould have been those speeches. He pointed out all the evils that\nwould follow the change. You might have called it prophetic--the way\nhe foresaw what would happen to Balder--or not Balder in particular, of\ncourse, but that whole class of young gentlemen.\n\n“As he said, you have only to ask yourself what kind of people the lower\nclasses naturally look up to and obey and follow. Will they be ordered\nabout by a man simply because he knows Greek and Latin and Hebrew? Do\nthey respect the village schoolmaster, for example, on account of his\nlearning? Not in the very slightest! On the contrary, they regard him\nwith the greatest contempt. The man they will serve is the man whose\nbirth gives him the right to command them, or else the man with money in\nhis pockets to make it worth their while. These two are the only leaders\nthey understand. And if that's true here in England, in times of peace,\namong our own people, how much truer must it be of our soldiers, away\nfrom England, in a time of war?”\n\n“But, mamma,” the Hon. Winifred intervened, “don't you see how badly\nthat might work nowadays? now that the good families have so little\nmoney, and all the fortunes are in the hands of stockjobbing people--and\nso on? It would be THEIR sons who would buy all the commissions--and I'm\nsure Balder wouldn't get on at all with that lot.”\n\nLady Plowden answered with decision and great promptness. “You see so\nlittle of the world, Winnie dear, that you don't get very clear ideas of\nits movements. The people who make fortunes in England are every whit\nas important to its welfare as those who inherit names, and individually\nI'm sure they are often much more deserving. Every generation sniffs\nat its nouveaux riches, but by the next they have become merged in the\naristocracy. It isn't a new thing in England at all. It has always been\nthat way. Two-thirds of the peerage have their start from a wealthy\nmerchant, or some other person who made a fortune. They are really the\nback-bone of England. You should keep that always in mind.”\n\n“Of course--I see what you mean”--Winnie replied, her dark cheek\nflushing faintly under the tacit reproof. She had passed her\ntwenty-fifth birthday, but her voice had in it the docile\nself-repression of a school-girl. She spoke with diffident slowness,\nher gaze fastened upon her plate. “Of course--my grandfather was\na lawyer--and your point is that merchants--and others who make\nfortunes--would be the same.”\n\n“Precisely,” said Lady Plowden. “And do tell us, Mr. Thorpe”--she turned\ntoward where he sat at her right and beamed at him over her spectacles,\nwith the air of having been wearied with a conversation in which he\nbore no part--“is it really true that social discontent is becoming more\nmarked in America, even, than it is with us in England?”\n\n“I'm not an American, you know,” he reminded her. “I only know one or\ntwo sections of the country--and those only as a stranger. You should\nask Miss Madden.”\n\n“Me?” said Celia. “Oh, I haven't come up for my examinations yet. I'm\nlike Balder--I'm preparing.”\n\n“What I should like Mr. Thorpe to tell us,” suggested Lady Cressage,\nmildly, “is about the flowers in the tropics--in Java, for example, or\nsome of the West Indies. One hears such marvelous tales about them.”\n\n“Speaking of flowers,” Thorpe suddenly decided to mention the fact; “I\nmet out in one of the greenhouses here this morning, an old acquaintance\nof mine, the gardener, Gafferson. The last time I saw him, he was\nrunning the worst hotel in the world in the worst country in the\nworld--out in British Honduras.”\n\n“But he's a wonderful gardener,” said Lady Cressage. “He's a magician;\nhe can do what he likes with plants. It's rather a hobby of mine--or\nused to be--and I never saw his equal.”\n\nThorpe told them about Gafferson, in that forlorn environment on the\nBelize road, and his success in making them laugh drew him on to other\npictures of the droll side of life among the misfits of adventure. The\nladies visibly dallied over their tea-cups to listen to him; the\ncharm of having them all to himself, and of holding them in interested\nentertainment by his discourse--these ladies of supremely refined\nassociations and position--seemed to provide an inspiration of its own.\nHe could hear that his voice was automatically modulating itself to\ntheir critical ears. His language was producing itself with as much\ndelicacy of selection as if it came out of a book--and yet preserving\nthe savour of quaint, outlandish idiom which his listeners clearly\nliked. Upon the instant when Lady Plowden's gathering of skirts, and\nglance across the table, warned him that they were to rise, he said\ndeliberately to himself that this had been the most enjoyable episode of\nhis whole life.\n\nThere were cigar boxes on the fine old oak mantel, out in the hall, and\nWinnie indicated them to him with the obvious suggestion that he was\nexpected to smoke. He looked her over as he lit his cigar--where she\nstood spreading her hands above the blaze of the logs, and concluded\nthat she was much nicer upon acquaintance than he had thought. Her\nslight figure might not be beautiful, but beyond doubt its lines were\nladylike. The same extenuating word applied itself in his mind to her\nthin and swarthy, though distinguished, features. They bore the stamp\nof caste, and so did the way she looked at one through her eye-glasses,\nfrom under those over-heavy black eyebrows, holding her head a little\nto one side. Though it was easy enough to guess that she had a spirit of\nher own, her gentle, almost anxious, deference to her mother had shown\nthat she had it under admirable control.\n\nHe had read about her in a peerage at his sister's book-shop the\nprevious day. Unfortunately it did not give her age, but that was not so\nimportant, after all. She was styled Honourable. She was the daughter\nof one Viscount and the sister of another. Her grandfather had been\nan Earl, and the book had shown her to possess a bewildering number\nof relationships among titled folks. All this was very interesting to\nhim--and somewhat suggestive. Vague, shapeless hints at projects rose in\nhis brain as he looked at her.\n\n“I'm afraid you think my brother has odd notions of entertaining his\nguests,” she remarked to him, over her shoulder. The other ladies had\nnot joined them.\n\n“Oh, I'm all right,” he protested cordially. “I should hate to have\nhim put himself out in the slightest.” Upon consideration he added: “I\nsuppose he has given up the idea of shooting to-day.”\n\n“I think not,” she answered.” The keeper was about this morning, that\nis--and he doesn't often come unless they are to go out with the guns. I\nsuppose you are very fond of shooting.”\n\n“Well--I've done some--in my time,” Thorpe replied, cautiously. It did\nnot seem necessary to explain that he had yet to fire his first gun on\nEnglish soil. “It's a good many years,” he went on, “since I had the\ntime and opportunity to do much at it. I think the last shooting I did\nwas alligators. You hit 'em in the eye, you know. But what kind of a\nhand I shall make of it with a shot-gun, I haven't the least idea. Is\nthe shooting round I here pretty good?”\n\n“I don't think it's anything remarkable. Plowden says my brother\nBalder kills all the birds off every season. Balder's by way of being\na crack-shot, you know. There are some pheasants, though. We saw them\nflying when we were out this morning.”\n\nThorpe wondered if it would be possible to consult her upon the question\nof apparel. Clearly, he ought to make some difference in his garb, yet\nthe mental vision of him-self in those old Mexican clothes revealed\nitself now as ridiculously impossible. He must have been out of his mind\nto have conceived anything so preposterous as rigging himself out, among\nthese polished people, like a cow-puncher down on his luck.\n\n“I wonder when your brother will expect to start,” he began, uneasily.\n“Perhaps I ought to go and get ready.”\n\n“Ah, here comes his man,” remarked the sister. A round-faced,\nsmooth-mannered youngster--whom Thorpe discovered to be wearing\ncord-breeches and leather leggings as he descended the stairs--advanced\ntoward him and prefaced his message by the invariable salutation. “His\nLordship will be down, sir, in ten minutes--and he hopes you'll be\nready, sir,” the valet said.\n\n“Send Pangbourn to this gentleman's room,” Miss Winnie bade him, and\nwith a gesture of comprehensive submission he went away.\n\nThe calm readiness with which she had provided a solution for his\ndifficulties impressed Thorpe greatly. It would never have occurred to\nhim that Pangbourn was the answer to the problem of his clothes, yet how\nobvious it had been to her. These old families did something more than\nfill their houses with servants; they mastered the art of making these\nservants an integral part of the machinery of existence. Fancy having a\nman to do all your thinking about clothes for you, and then dress you,\ninto the bargain. Oh, it was all splendid.\n\n“It seems that we're going shooting,” Thorpe found himself explaining, a\nfew moments later in his bedroom, to the attentive Pangbourn. He\ndecided to throw himself with frankness upon the domestic's resourceful\ngood-feeling. “I haven't brought anything for shooting at all. Somehow I\ngot the idea we were going to do rough riding instead--and so I fetched\nalong some old Mexican riding-clothes that make me feel more at home\nin the saddle than anything else would. You know how fond a man gets of\nold, loose things like that. But about this shooting--I want you to fix\nme out. What do I need? Just some breeches and leggings, eh? You can\nmanage them for me, can't you?”\n\nPangbourn could and did--and it was upon his advice that the Mexican\njacket was utilized to complete the out-fit. Its shape was beyond doubt\nuncommon, but it had big pockets, and it looked like business. Thorpe,\nas he glanced up and down his image in the tall mirror of the wardrobe,\nfelt that he must kill a large number of birds to justify the effect of\npitiless proficiency which this jacket lent to his appearance.\n\n“We will find a cap below, sir,” Pangbourn announced, with serenity, and\nThorpe, who had been tentatively fingering the big, flaring sombrero,\nthrust it back upon its peg as if it had proved too hot to handle.\n\nDownstairs in the hall there was more waiting to be done, and there was\nnobody now to bear him company. He lit another cigar, tried on various\ncaps till he found a leathern one to suit him, and then dawdled about\nthe room and the adjoining conservatory for what seemed to him more than\nhalf an hour. This phase of the aristocratic routine, he felt, did not\ncommend itself so warmly to him as did some others. Everybody else,\nhowever, seemed to regard it as so wholly a matter of course that\nPlowden should do as he liked, that he forbore formulating a complaint\neven to himself.\n\nAt last, this nobleman's valet descended the stairs once more. “His\nLordship will be down very shortly now, sir,” he declared--“and will you\nbe good enough to come into the gun-room, sir, and see the keeper?”\n\nThorpe followed him through a doorway under the staircase--the existence\nof which he had not suspected--into a bare-looking apartment fitted like\na pantry with shelves. After the semi-gloom of the hall, it was almost\nglaringly lighted. The windows and another door opened, he saw, upon a\ncourt connected with the stable-yard. By this entrance, no doubt, had\ncome the keeper, a small, brown-faced, brown-clothed man of mature\nyears, with the strap of a pouch over his shoulder, who stood looking at\nthe contents of the shelves. He mechanically saluted Thorpe in turn, and\nthen resumed his occupation. There were numerous gun cases on the lower\nshelf, and many boxes and bags above.\n\n“Did his Lordship say what gun?” the keeper demanded of the valet. He\nhad a bright-eyed, intent glance, and his tone conveyed a sense of some\nbroad, impersonal, out-of-doors disdain for liveried house-men.\n\nThe valet, standing behind Thorpe, shrugged his shoulders and eloquently\nshook his head.\n\n“Do you like an 'ammerless, sir?” the keeper turned to Thorpe.\n\nTo his intense humiliation, Thorpe could not make out the meaning of the\nquery. “Oh, anything'll do for me,” he said, awkwardly smiling. “It's\nyears since I've shot--I daresay one gun'll be quite the same as another\nto me.”\n\nHe felt the knowing bright eyes of the keeper taking all his\nmeasurements as a sportsman. “You'd do best with 'B,' sir, I fancy,” the\nfunctionary decided at last, and his way of saying it gave Thorpe the\nnotion that “B” must be the weapon that was reserved for school-boys. He\nwatched the operation of putting the gun together, and then took it, and\nlaid it over his arm, and followed the valet out into the hall again, in\ndignified silence. To the keeper's remark--“Mr. Balder has its mate with\nhim today, sir,” he gave only a restrained nod.\n\nThere were even now whole minutes to wait before Lord Plowden appeared.\nHe came down the stairs then with the brisk, rather impatient air of a\nbusy man whose plans are embarrassed by the unpunctuality of others.\nHe was fully attired, hob-nailed shoes, leggings, leather coat and cap,\ngloves, scarf round his throat and all--and he behaved as if there was\nnot a minute to lose. He had barely time to shake perfunctorily the\nhand Thorpe offered him, and utter an absent-minded “How are you this\nmorning?”\n\nTo the valet, who hurried forward to open the outer door, bearing his\nmaster's gun and a camp-stool, he said reproachfully, “We are very late\ntoday, Barnes.” They went out, and began striding down the avenue of\ntrees at such a pace that the keeper and his following of small boys and\ndogs, who joined them near the road, were forced into a trot to keep up\nwith it.\n\nThorpe had fancied, somehow, that a day's shooting would afford\nexceptional opportunities for quiet and intimate talk with his host,\nbut he perceived very soon that this was not to be the case. They walked\ntogether for half a mile, it is true, along a rural bye-road first and\nthen across some fields, but the party was close at their heels, and\nPlowden walked so fast that conversation of any sort, save an occasional\nremark about the birds and the covers between him and the keeper, was\nimpracticable. The Hon. Balder suddenly turned up in the landscape,\nleaning against a gate set in a hedgerow, and their course was deflected\ntoward him, but even when they came up to him, the expedition seemed\nto gain nothing of a social character. The few curt words that were\nexchanged, as they halted here to distribute cartridges and hold brief\nconsultation, bore exclusively upon the subject in hand.\n\nThe keeper assumed now an authority which Thorpe, breathing heavily over\nthe unwonted exercise and hoping for nothing so much as that they would\nhenceforth take things easy, thought intolerable. He was amazed that\nthe two brothers should take without cavil the arbitrary orders of this\nelderly peasant. He bade Lord Plowden proceed to a certain point in one\ndirection, and that nobleman, followed by his valet with the gun and\nthe stool, set meekly off without a word. Balder, with equal docility,\nvaulted the gate, and moved away down the lane at the bidding of the\nkeeper. Neither of them had intervened to mitigate the destiny of their\nguest, or displayed any interest as to what was going to become of him.\n\nThorpe said to himself that he did not like this--and though afterward,\nwhen he had also climbed the gate and taken up his station under a\nclump of trees at the autocrat's behest, he strove to soothe his ruffled\nfeelings by the argument that it was probably the absolutely correct\ndeportment for a shooting party, his mind remained unconvinced.\nMoreover, in parting from him, the keeper had dropped a blunt injunction\nabout firing up or down the lane, the tone even more than the matter of\nwhich nettled him.\n\nTo cap all, when he presently ventured to stroll about a little from\nthe spot on which he had been planted, he caught a glimpse against the\nskyline of the distant Lord Plowden, comfortably seated on the stool\nwhich his valet had been carrying. It seemed to Thorpe at that moment\nthat he had never wanted to sit down so much before in his life--and he\nturned on his heel in the wet grass with a grunt of displeasure.\n\nThis mood vanished utterly a few moments later. The remote sounds had\nbegun to come to him, of boys shouting and dogs barking, in the recesses\nof the strip of woodland which the lane skirted, and at these he\nhastened back to his post. It did not seem to him a good place, and when\nhe heard the reports of guns to right and left of him, and nothing came\nhis way, he liked it less than ever; it had become a matter of offended\npride with him, however, to relieve the keeper of no atom of the\nresponsibility he had taken upon himself. If Lord Plowden's guest had\nno sport, the blame for it should rest upon Lord Plowden's over-arrogant\nkeeper. Then a noise of a different character assailed his ears,\npunctuated as it were by distant boyish cries of “mark!” These cries,\nand the buzzing sound as of clockwork gone wrong which they accompanied\nand heralded, became all at once a most urgent affair of his own.\nHe strained his eyes upon the horizon of the thicket--and, as if by\ninstinct, the gun sprang up to adjust its sight to this eager gaze, and\nfollowed automatically the thundering course of the big bird, and then,\ntaking thought to itself, leaped ahead of it and fired. Thorpe's first\npheasant reeled in the air, described a somersault, and fell like a\nplummet.\n\nHe stirred not a step, but reloaded the barrel with a hand shaking for\njoy. From where he stood he could see the dead bird; there could never\nhave been a cleaner “kill.” In the warming glow of his satisfaction in\nhimself, there kindled a new liking of a different sort for Plowden\nand Balder. He owed to them, at this belated hour of his life, a novel\ndelight of indescribable charm. There came to him, from the woods, the\nshrill bucolic voice of the keeper, admonishing a wayward dog. He was\nconscious of even a certain tenderness for this keeper--and again the\ncry of “mark!” rose, strenuously addressed to him.\n\nHalf an hour later the wood had been cleared, and Thorpe saw the rest\nof the party assembling by the gate. He did not hurry to join them, but\nwhen Lord Plowden appeared he sauntered slowly over, gun over arm, with\nas indifferent an air as he could simulate. It pleased him tremendously\nthat no one had thought it worth while to approach the rendezvous by\nway of the spot he had covered. His eye took instant stock of the game\ncarried by two of the boys; their combined prizes were eight birds and a\nrabbit, and his heart leaped within him at the count.\n\n“Well, Thorpe?” asked Plowden, pleasantly. The smell of gunpowder and\nthe sight of stained feathers had co-operated to brighten and cheer his\nmood. “I heard you blazing away in great form. Did you get anything?”\n\nThorpe strove hard to give his voice a careless note. “Let some of the\nboys run over,” he said slowly. “There are nine birds within sight, and\nthere are two or three in the bushes--but they may have got away.”\n\n“Gad!” said Balder.\n\n“Magnificent!” was his brother's comment--and Thorpe permitted himself\nthe luxury of a long-drawn, beaming sigh of triumph.\n\nThe roseate colouring of this triumph seemed really to tint everything\nthat remained of Thorpe's visit. He set down to it without hesitation\nthe visible augmentation of deference to him among the servants. The\ntemptation was very great to believe that it had affected the ladies of\nthe house as well. He could not say that they were more gracious to him,\nbut certainly they appeared to take him more for granted. In a hundred\nlittle ways, he seemed to perceive that he was no longer held mentally\nat arm's length as a stranger to their caste. Of course, his own\nrestored self-confidence could account for much of this, but he clung to\nthe whimsical conceit that much was also due to the fact that he was the\nman of the pheasants.\n\nSunday was bleak and stormy, and no one stirred out of the house. He was\nalone again with the ladies at breakfast, and during the long day he was\nmuch in their company. It was like no other day he had ever imagined to\nhimself.\n\nOn the morrow, in the morning train by which he returned alone to town,\nhis mind roved luxuriously among the fragrant memories of that day.\nHe had been so perfectly at home--and in such a home! There were some\nthings which came uppermost again and again--but of them all he dwelt\nmost fixedly upon the recollection of moving about in the greenhouses\nand conservatories, with that tall, stately, fair Lady Cressage for his\nguide, and watching her instead of the flowers that she pointed out. Of\nwhat she had told him, not a syllable stuck in his mind, but the music\nof the voice lingered in his ears.\n\n“And she is old Kervick's daughter!” he said to himself more than once.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nIT may be that every other passenger in that morning train to London\nnursed either a silent rage, or declaimed aloud to fellow-sufferers in\nindignation, at the time consumed in making what, by the map, should be\nso brief a journey. In Thorpe's own compartment, men spoke with savage\nirony of cyclists alleged to be passing them on the road, and exchanged\ndark prophecies as to the novelties in imbecility and helplessness which\nthe line would be preparing for the Christmas holidays. The old joke\nabout people who had gone travelling years before, and were believed\nto be still lost somewhere in the recesses of Kent, revived itself amid\ngloomy approbation. The still older discussion as to whether the South\nEastern or the Brighton was really the worst followed naturally in its\nwake, and occupied its accustomed half-hour--complicated, however, upon\nthis occasion, by the chance presence of a loquacious stranger who said\nhe lived on the Chatham-and-Dover, and who rejected boisterously the\nidea that any other railway could be half so bad.\n\nThe intrusion of this outsider aroused instant resentment, and the\nchampions of the South Eastern and the Brighton, having piled up\nadditional defenses in the shape of personal recollections of delay\nand mismanagement quite beyond belief, made a combined attack upon the\nnewcomer. He was evidently incapable, their remarks implied, of knowing\na bad railway when he saw one. To suggest that the characterless and\ninoffensive Chatham-and-Dover, so commonplace in its tame virtues,\nwas to be mentioned in the same breath with the daringly inventive\nand resourceful malefactors whose rendezvous was London Bridge, showed\neither a weak mind or a corrupt heart. Did this man really live on the\nDover line at all? Angry countenances plainly reflected the doubt.\n\nBut to Thorpe the journey seemed short enough--almost too short.\nThe conversation interested him not at all; if he had ever known the\nSouthern lines apart, they were all one to him now. He looked out of the\nwindow, and could have sworn that he thought of nothing but the visit\nfrom which he was returning.\n\nWhen he alighted at Cannon Street, however, it was to discover that his\nmind was full of a large, new, carefully-prepared project. It came to\nhim, ready-made and practically complete, as he stood on the platform,\nsuperintending the porter's efforts to find his bags. He turned it over\nand over in his thoughts, in the hansom, more to familiarize himself\nwith its details than to add to them. He left the cab to wait for him at\nthe mouth of a little alley which delves its way into Old Broad Street\nthrough towering walls of commercial buildings, old and new.\n\nColin Semple was happily in his office--a congeries of small, huddled\nrooms, dry and dirty with age, which had a doorway of its own in a\ncorner of the court--and Thorpe pushed on to his room at the end like\none who is assured of both his way and his welcome.\n\nThe broker was standing beside a desk, dictating a letter to a clerk\nwho sat at it, and with only a nod to Thorpe he proceeded to finish\nthis task. He looked more than once at his visitor as he did so, in\na preoccupied, impersonal way. To the other's notion, he seemed the\npersonification of business--without an ounce of distracting superfluous\nflesh upon his wiry, tough little frame, without a trace of unnecessary\npoliteness, or humour, or sensibility of any sort. He was the machine\nperfected and fined down to absolute essentials. He could understand a\njoke if it was useful to him to do so. He could drink, and even smoke\ncigarettes, with a natural air, if these exercises seemed properly to\nbelong to the task he had in hand. Thorpe did not conceive him doing\nanything for the mere human reason that he liked to do it. There was\nmore than a touch of what the rustic calls “ginger” in his hair and\nclosely-cropped, pointed beard, and he had the complementary florid\nskin. His eyes--notably direct, confident eyes--were of a grey which had\nin it more brown than blue. He wore a black frock-coat, buttoned close,\nand his linen produced the effect of a conspicuous whiteness.\n\nHe turned as the clerk left the room, and let his serious, thin\nlips relax for an instant as a deferred greeting. “Well?” he asked,\nimpassively.\n\n“Have you got a quarter-of-an-hour?” asked Thorpe in turn. “I want a\ntalk with you.”\n\nFor answer, Semple left the room. Returning after a minute or two,\nhe remarked, “Go ahead till we're stopped,” and seated himself on the\ncorner of the desk with the light inconsequence of a bird on a twig.\nThorpe unbuttoned his overcoat, laid aside his hat, and seated himself.\n\n“I've worked out the whole scheme,” he began, as if introducing the\nproduct of many sleepless nights' cogitations. “I'm going to leave\nEngland almost immediately--go on the Continent and loaf about--I've\nnever seen the Continent.”\n\nSemple regarded him in silence. “Well?” he observed at last.\n\n“You see the idea, don't you?” Thorpe demanded.\n\nThe broker twitched his shoulders slightly. “Go on,” he said.\n\n“But the idea is everything,” protested the other. “We've been thinking\nof beginning the campaign straight away--but the true game now is to lie\nlow--silent as the grave. I go away now, d'ye see? Nothing particular\nis said about it, of course, but in a month or two somebody notices that\nI'm not about, and he happens to mention it to somebody else--and so\nthere gets to be the impression that things haven't gone well with me,\nd'ye see? On the same plan, I let all the clerks at my office go. The\nSecretary'll come round every once in a while to get letters, of\ncourse, and perhaps he'll keep a boy in the front office for show,\nbut practically the place'll be shut up. That'll help out the general\nimpression that I've gone to pieces. Now d'ye see?”\n\n“It's the Special Settlement you're thinking of,” commented Semple.\n\n“Of course. The fellows that we're going to squeeze would move heaven\nand hell to prevent our getting that Settlement, if they got wind\nof what was going on. The only weak point in our game is just there.\nAbsolutely everything hangs on the Settlement being granted. Naturally,\nthen, our play is to concentrate everything on getting it granted. We\ndon't want to raise the remotest shadow of a suspicion of what we're\nup to, till after we're safe past that rock. So we go on in the way\nto attract the least possible attention. You or your jobber makes the\nordinary application for a Special Settlement, with your six signatures\nand so on; and I go abroad quietly, and the office is as good as shut\nup, and nobody makes a peep about Rubber Consols--and the thing works\nitself. You do see it, don't you?”\n\n“I see well enough the things that are to be seen,” replied Semple, with\na certain brevity of manner. “There was a sermon of my father's that I\nremember, and it had for its text, 'We look not at the things which are\nseen, but at the things which are not seen.'”\n\nThorpe, pondering this for a moment, nodded his head. “Semple,” he said,\nbringing his chair forward to the desk, “that's what I've come for. I\nwant to spread my cards on the table for you. I know the sum you've laid\nout already, in working this thing. We'll say that that is to be paid\nback to you, as a separate transaction, and we'll put that to one side.\nNow then, leaving that out of consideration, what do you think you ought\nto have out of the winnings, when we pull the thing off? Mind, I'm not\nthinking of your 2,000 vendor's shares----”\n\n“No--I'm not thinking much of them, either,” interposed Semple, with a\nkind of dry significance.\n\n“Oh, they'll be all right,” Thorpe affirmed. He laughed unconsciously as\nhe did so. “No, what I want to get at is your idea of what should come\nto you, as a bonus, when I scoop the board.”\n\n“Twenty thousand pounds,” said Semple, readily.\n\nThorpe's slow glance brightened a trifle. “I had thought thirty would be\na fairer figure,” he remarked, with an effort at simplicity.\n\nThe broker put out his under-lip. “You will find people rather disposed\nto distrust a man who promises more than he's asked,” he remarked\ncoldly.\n\n“Yes--I know what you mean,” Thorpe hurried to say, flushing awkwardly,\neven though the remark was so undeserved; “but it's in my nature. I'm\nfull of the notion of doing things for people that have done things\nfor me. That's the way I'm built. Why”--he halted to consider the\nadvisability of disclosing what he had promised to do for Lord Plowden,\nand decided against it--“why, without you, what would the whole\nthing have been worth to me? Take one thing alone--the money for the\napplications--I could have no more got at it than I could at the Crown\nJewels in the Tower. I've wondered since, more than once--if you don't\nmind the question--how did you happen to have so much ready money lying\nabout.”\n\n“There are some Glasgow and Aberdeen folk who trust me to invest for\nthem,” the broker explained. “If they get five per cent. for the four\nmonths, they'll be very pleased. And so I shall be very pleased to take\nthirty thousand instead of twenty--if it presents itself to your mind in\nthat way. You will give me a letter to that effect, of course.”\n\n“Of course,” assented Thorpe. “Write it now, if you like.” He pushed his\nchair forward, closer to the desk, and dipped a pen in the ink. “What\nI want to do is this,” he said, looking up. “I'll make the promise for\nthirty-two thousand, and I'll get you to let me have two thousand in\ncash now--a personal advance. I shall need it, if I'm to hang about on\nthe Continent for four months. I judge you think it'll be four months\nbefore things materialize, eh?”\n\n“The Special Settlement, in the natural order of events, would come\nshortly after the Christmas holidays. That is nearly three months. Then\nthe work of taking fort-nightly profits will begin--and it is for you to\nsay how long you allow that to go on.”\n\n“But about the two thousand pounds now,” Thorpe reminded him.\n\n“I think I will do that in this way,” said Semple, kicking his small\nlegs nonchalantly. “I will buy two thousand fully-paid shares of you,\nfor cash down, NOT vendor's shares, you observe--and then I will take\nyour acknowledgment that you hold them for me in trust up to a given\ndate. In that way, I would not at all weaken your market, and I would\nhave a stake in the game.” “Your stake's pretty big, already,” commented\nThorpe, tentatively.\n\n“It's just a fancy of mine,” said the other, with his first smile. “I\nlike to hold shares that are making sensational advances. It is very\nexciting.”\n\n“All right,” said Thorpe, in accents of resignation. He wrote out two\nletters, accepting the wording which Semple suggested from his perch on\nthe desk, and then the latter, hopping down, took the chair in turn and\nwrote a cheque.\n\n“Do you want it open?” he asked over his shoulder. “Are you going to get\nit cashed at once?”\n\n“No--cross it,” said the other. “I want it to go through my bankers.\nIt'll warm their hearts toward me. I shan't be going till the end of the\nweek, in any event. I suppose you know the Continent by heart.”\n\n“On the contrary, very little indeed. I've had business in Frankfort\nonce, and in Rotterdam once, and in Paris twice. That is all.”\n\n“But don't you ever do anything for pleasure?” Thorpe asked him, as he\nfolded the cheque in his pocket-book.\n\n“Oh yes--many things,” responded the broker, lightly. “It's a pleasure,\nfor example, to buy Rubber Consols at par.”\n\n“Oh, if you call it buying,” said Thorpe, and then softened his words\nwith an apologetic laugh. “I didn't tell you, did I? I've been spending\nSaturday and Sunday with Plowden--you know, the Lord Plowden on my\nBoard.”\n\n“I know of him very well,” observed the Scotchman.\n\n“Has he a place that he asks people down to, then? That isn't the usual\nform with guinea-pigs.”\n\n“Ah, but, he isn't the guinea-pig variety at all,” Thorpe asserted,\nwarmly. “He's really a splendid fellow--with his little oddities, like\nthe rest of us, of course, but a decent chap all through. Place?\nI should think he HAD got a place! It's one of the swellest old\ncountry-houses you ever saw--older than hell, you know--and it's kept\nup as if they had fifty thousand a year. Do you happen to know what his\nreal income is supposed to be?”\n\nSemple shook his head. He had taken his hat, and was smoothing it deftly\nwith the palm of his hand.\n\n“I asked,” Thorpe went on, “because he had so much to say about his\npoverty. To hear him talk, you'd think the bailiffs were sitting on his\ndoorstep. That doesn't prevent his having fast horses, and servants all\nover the place, and about the best shooting I've seen in the South of\nEngland. As luck would have it, I was in wonderful form. God! how I\nknocked the pheasants!” A clerk showed his head at the door, with a\nmeaning gesture. “I must go now,” said Semple, briskly, and led the way\nout to another room. He halted here, and dismissed his caller with the\nbrief injunction, “Don't go away without seeing me.”\n\nIt was the noon-hour, and the least-considered grades of the City's\nslaves were in the streets on the quest for cheap luncheons. Thorpe\nnoted the manner in which some of them studied the large bill of\nfare placarded beside a restaurant door; the spectacle prompted him\nluxuriously to rattle the gold coins remaining in his pocket. He had\nbeen as anxious about pence as the hungriest of those poor devils, only\na week before. And now! He thrust up the door in the roof of the cab,\nand bade the driver stop at his bank. Thence, after some brief but very\nagreeable business, and a hurried inspection of the “Court” section of\na London Directory, he drove to a telegraph station and despatched two\nmessages. They were identical in terms. One sought General Kervick\nat his residence--he was in lodgings somewhere in the Hanover Square\ncountry--and the other looked for him at his club. Both begged him to\nlunch at the Savoy at two o'clock.\n\nThere was time and to spare, now. Thorpe dismissed the cab at his\nhotel--an unpretentious house in Craven Street, and sent his luggage to\nhis rooms. There were no letters for him on the board in the hallway,\nand he sauntered up to the Strand. As by force of habit, he turned\npresently into a side-street, and stopped opposite the ancient book-shop\nof his family.\n\nIn the bright yet mellow light of the sunny autumn noontide, the blacks\nand roans and smoked drabs of the low old brick front looked more dingy\nto his eye than ever. It spoke of antiquity, no doubt, but it was a\ndismal and graceless antiquity of narrow purposes and niggling thrift.\nIt was so little like the antiquity, for example, of Hadlow House, that\nthe two might have computed their age by the chronological systems of\ndifferent planets. Although his sister's married name was Dabney, and\nshe had been sole proprietor for nearly a dozen years, the sign over the\ndoorway bore still its century-old legend, “Thorpe, Bookseller.”\n\nHe crossed the street, and paused for a moment to run an eye over the\nbooks and placards exposed on either side of the entrance. A small boy\nguarded these wares, and Thorpe considered him briefly, with curious\nrecollections of how much of his own boyhood had been spent on that\nvery spot. The lad under observation had a loutish and sullen face; its\nexpression could not have been more devoid of intellectual suggestions\nif he had been posted in a Wiltshire field to frighten crows with\na rattle, instead of being set here in the highway of the world's\nbrain-movement, an agent of students and philosophers. Thorpe wondered\nif in his time he could have looked such a vacant and sour young\nfool. No--no. That could not be. Boys were different in his day--and\nespecially boys in book-shops. They read something and knew something of\nwhat they handled. They had some sort of aspirations, fitful and vague\nas these might be, to become in their time bookmen also. And in those\ndays there still were bookmen--widely-informed, observant, devoted old\nbookmen--who loved their trade, and adorned it.\n\nThorpe reflected that, as he grew older, he was the better able to\napprehend the admirable qualities of that departed race of literature's\nservants. Indeed, it seemed that he had never adequately realized before\nhow proud a man might well be of descending from a line of such men.\nThe thought struck him that very likely at this identical doorway, two\ngenerations back, a poor, out-at-the-elbows, young law-student named\nPlowden had stood and turned over pages of books he could not dream of\nbuying. Perhaps, even, he had ventured inside, and deferentially picked\nacquaintance with the Thorpe of the period, and got bookish advice and\nfriendly counsel for nothing. It was of no real significance that the\nlaw-student grew to be Lord Chancellor, and the bookseller remained a\nbook-seller; in the realm of actual values, the Thorpes were as good as\nthe Plowdens.\n\nA customer came out of the shop, and Thorpe went in, squeezing his way\nalong the narrow passage between the tall rows of books, to the small\nopen space at the end. His sister stood here, momentarily occupied at a\nhigh desk. She did not look up.\n\n“Well--I visited his Lordship all right.” He announced his presence thus\ngenially.\n\n“I hope you're the better for it,” she remarked, turning to him, after a\npause, her emotionless, plain face.\n\n“Oh, immensely,” he affirmed, with robust jocularity. “You should have\nseen the way they took to me. It was 'Mr. Thorpe' here and 'Mr. Thorpe'\nthere, all over the place. Ladies of title, mind you--all to myself at\nbreakfast two days running. And such ladies--finer than silk. Oh, it's\nclear as daylight--I was intended for a fashionable career.”\n\nShe smiled in a faint, passive way. “Well--they say 'better late\nthan never,' you know.” “And after all, IS it so very late?” he said,\nadopting her phrase as an expression of his thought. “I'm just turned\nforty, and I feel like a boy. I was looking at that 'Peerage' there,\nthe other day--and do you know, I'm sixteen years younger than the first\nLord Plowden was when they made him a peer? Why he didn't even get into\nthe House of Commons until he was seven-and-forty.”\n\n“You seem to have the Plowden family on the brain,” she commented.\n\n“I might have worse things. You've no idea, Lou, how nice it all is. The\nmother, Lady Plowden--why she made me feel as if I was at the very\nleast a nephew of hers. And so simple and natural! She smiled at me,\nand listened to me, and said friendly things to me--why, just as anybody\nmight have done. You'll just love her, when you know her.”\n\nLouisa laughed in his face. “Don't be a fool, Joel,” she adjured him,\nwith a flash of scornful mirth. He mingled a certain frowning impatience\nwith the buoyancy of his smile. “Why, of course, you'll know her,” he\nprotested. “What nonsense you're thinking of! Do you suppose I'm going\nto allow you to mess about here with second-hand almanacs, and a sign in\nyour window of 'threepence in the shilling discount for cash,' while I'm\na millionaire? It's too foolish, Lou. You annoy me by supposing such a\nthing!”\n\n“There's no good talking about it at all,” she observed, after a little\npause. “It hasn't come off yet, for one thing. And as I said the other\nnight, if you want to do things for the children, that's another matter.\nThey're of an age when they can learn whatever anybody chooses to teach\nthem.”\n\n“Where are they now?” he asked. Upon the instant another plan began to\nunfold itself in the background of his mind.\n\n“They're both at Cheltenham, though they're at different places, of\ncourse. I was recommended to send Julia there--one of our old customers\nis a Governor, or whatever it's called--and he got special terms for\nher. She was rather old, you know, to go to school, but he arranged it\nvery nicely for her--and there is such a good boys' college there,\nit seemed the wisest thing to send Alfred too. Julia is to finish at\nChristmas-time--and what I'm going to do with her afterward is more than\nI know.”\n\n“Is she pretty?” the uncle of Julia enquired.\n\n“She's very nice,” the mother answered, with vague extenuation in her\ntone. “I don't know about her looks--she varies so much. Sometimes I\nthink she's pretty--and then again I can't think it. She's got\ngood features, and she holds herself well, and she's very much the\nlady--rather too much, I think, sometimes--but it all depends upon what\nyou call pretty. She's not tall, you know. She takes after her father's\nfamily. The Dabneys are all little people.”\n\nThorpe seemed not to care about the Dabneys. “And what's Alfred like?”\n he asked.\n\n“He wants to be an artist!” There was a perceptible note of apprehension\nin the mother's confession.\n\n“Well--why shouldn't he--if he's got a bent that way?” demanded Thorpe,\nwith reproof in his tone. “Did you want him to be a shop-keeper?”\n\n“I should like to see him a doctor,” she replied with dignity. “It was\nalways my idea for him.”\n\n“Well, it's no good--even as an idea,” he told her. “Doctors are like\nparsons--they can't keep up with the times. The age is outgrowing them.\nOnly the fakirs in either profession get anything out of it, nowadays.\nIt's all mystery and sleight-of-hand and the confidence trick--medicine\nis--and if you haven't got just the right twist of the wrist, you're not\nin it. But an artist stands on his merits. There is his work--done by\nhis own hands. It speaks for itself. There's no deception--it's easy\nenough to tell whether it's good or bad. If the pictures are good,\npeople buy them. If they're bad, people don't buy them. Of course, it\nwon't matter to Alfred, financially speaking, whether his pictures sell\nwell or not. But probably he'd give it up, if he didn't make a hit of\nit.\n\n“I don't know that there's any crying need that he should do anything.\nMy own idea for him, perhaps, would be the Army, but I wouldn't dream of\nforcing it on him against his will. I had a bitter enough dose of that,\nmyself, with father. I'd try to guide a youngster, yes, and perhaps\nargue with him, if I thought he was making a jack of himself--but I\nwouldn't dictate. If Alfred thinks he wants to be an artist, in God's\nname let him go ahead. It can be made a gentlemanly trade--and the main\nthing is that he should be a gentleman.”\n\nLouisa had listened to this discourse with apathetic patience. “If you\ndon't mind, I don't know that I do,” she said when it was finished.\n“Perhaps he wouldn't have made a good doctor; he's got a very quick\ntemper. He reminds me of father--oh, ever so much more than you do. He\ncontradicts everything everybody says. He quite knows it all.”\n\n“But he's a good fellow, isn't he?” urged Thorpe. “I mean, he's got his\nlikable points? I'm going to be able to get along with him?”\n\n“I didn't get along with him very well,” the mother admitted,\nreluctantly, “but I daresay with a man it would be different. You see,\nhis father was ill all those four years, and Alfred hated the shop as\nbad as you did, and perhaps in my worry I blamed him more than was fair.\nI want to be fair to him, you know.”\n\n“But is he a gentleman? That puts it in a word,” Thorpe insisted.\n\n“Oh, mercy yes,” Louisa made ready answer. “My only fear is--whether you\nwon't find him too much of a gentleman.”\n\nThorpe knitted his brows. “I only hope we're talking about the same\nthing,” he said, in a doubtful tone. Before she could speak, he lifted\nhis hand. “Never mind--I can see for myself in ten minutes more than you\ncould tell me in a lifetime. I've got a plan. I'm going on the Continent\nin a few days' time, to stay for three or four months. I've got nothing\nspecial to do--just to travel about and see things and kill time--I\nshall probably go to Italy and Switzerland and Paris and the Rhine\nand all sorts of places--and it occurred to me that I'd take the two\nyoungsters with me. I could get acquainted with them, that way, and\nthey'd be company for me. I've been lonesome so long, it would feel good\nto have some of my own flesh and blood about me--and I suppose they'd be\ntickled to death to go.”\n\n“Their schooling and board are paid for up to Christmas,” Mrs. Dabney\nobjected, blankly.\n\n“Bah!” Thorpe prolonged the emphatic exclamation into something\ngood-natured, and ended it with an abrupt laugh. “What on earth\ndifference does that make? I could go and buy their damned colleges, and\nlet the kids wear them for breastpins if I wanted to. You said the girl\nwas going to quit at Christmas in any case. Won't she learn more in four\nmonths travelling about on the Continent, than she would trotting around\nin her own tracks there at Cheltenham?\n\n“And it's even more important for the boy. He's of an age when he ought\nto see something of the world, and I ought to see something of him.\nWhatever he's going to do, it's time that he began getting his special\nstart for it.” He added, upon a luminous afterthought: “Perhaps his\nseeing the old Italian picture galleries and so on will cure him of\nwanting to be an artist.”\n\nThe mother's air displayed resigned acquiescence rather than conviction.\n“Well--if you really think it's best,” she began, “I don't know that\nI ought to object. Goodness knows, I don't want to stand in their way.\nEver since you sent that four hundred pounds, it hasn't seemed as if\nthey were my children at all. They've scarcely listened to me. And now\nyou come, and propose to take them out of my hands altogether--and all\nI can say is--I hope you feel entirely justified. And so, shall I write\nthem to come home? When do you think of starting? Julia ought to have\nsome travelling clothes.”\n\n“I can wait till you get her ready--only you must hurry up about it.”\n\nRemembering something, he took out his cheque-book, and spread it on\nthe desk. “I will give you back that thirty,” he said, as he wrote, “and\nhere's a hundred to get the youngsters ready. You won't waste any time,\nwill you? and if you want more tell me.”\n\nA customer had entered the shop, and Thorpe made it the occasion for\nleaving.\n\nHis sister, looking after her brother with the cheque in her hand,\nwas conscious of a thought which seemed to spell itself out in visible\nletters before her mental vision. “Even now I don't believe in him,” the\nimpalpable legend ran.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nGENERAL KERVICK was by habit a punctual man, and Thorpe found him\nhovering, carefully gloved and fur-coated, in the neighbourhood of the\nluncheon-room when he arrived. It indeed still lacked a few minutes of\nthe appointed hour when they thus met and went in together. They were\nfortunate enough to find a small table out on the balcony, sufficiently\nremoved from any other to give privacy to their conversation.\n\nBy tacit agreement, the General ordered the luncheon, speaking French to\nthe waiter throughout. Divested of his imposing great-coat, he was seen\nto be a gentleman of meagre flesh as well as of small stature. He had\nthe Roman nose, narrow forehead, bushing brows, and sharply-cut mouth\nand chin of a soldier grown old in the contemplation of portraits of the\nDuke of Wellington. His face and neck were of a dull reddish tint, which\nseemed at first sight uniformly distributed: one saw afterward that\nit approached pallor at the veined temples, and ripened into purple in\nminute patches on the cheeks and the tip of the pointed nose. Against\nthis flushed skin, the closely-cropped hair and small, neatly-waxed\nmoustache were very white indeed. It was a thin, lined, care-worn face,\nwithal, which in repose, and particularly in profile, produced an effect\nof dignified and philosophical melancholy. The General's over-prominent\nlight blue eyes upon occasion marred this effect, however, by glances\nof a bold, harsh character, which seemed to disclose unpleasant depths\nbelow the correct surface. His manner with the waiters was abrupt and\nsharp, but undoubtedly they served him very well--much better, in truth,\nthan Thorpe had ever seen them serve anybody before.\n\nThorpe observed his guest a good deal during the repast, and formed\nnumerous conclusions about him. He ate with palpable relish of every\ndish, and he emptied his glass as promptly as his host could fill\nit. There was hardly a word of explanation as to the purpose of their\nmeeting, until the coffee was brought, and they pushed back their\nchairs, crossed their legs, and lighted cigars.\n\n“I was lucky to catch you with my wire, at such short notice,” Thorpe\nsaid then. “I sent two, you know--to your chambers and your club. Which\nof them found you?”\n\n“Chambers,” said the General. “I rarely dress till luncheon time. I read\nin bed. There's really nothing else to do. Idleness is the curse of my\nlife.”\n\n“I've been wondering if you'd like a little occupation--of a well-paid\nsort,” said Thorpe slowly. He realized that it was high time to invent\nsome pretext for his hurried summons of the General.\n\n“My dear sir,” responded the other, “I should like anything that had\nmoney in it. And I should very much like occupation, too--if it were, of\ncourse, something that was--was suitable to me.”\n\n“Yes,” said Thorpe, meditatively. “I've something in my mind--not at all\ndefinite yet--in fact, I don't think I can even outline it to you\nyet. But I'm sure it will suit you--that is, if I decide to go on with\nit--and there ought to be seven or eight hundred a year for you in\nit--for life, mind you.”\n\nThe General's gaze, fastened strenuously upon Thorpe, shook a little.\n“That will suit me very well,” he declared, with feeling. “Whatever\nI can do for it”--he let the sentence end itself with a significant\ngesture.\n\n“I thought so,” commented the other, trifling with the spoon in his cup.\n“But I want you to be open with me. I'm interested in you, and I want to\nbe of use to you. All that I've said, I can do for you. But first,\nI'm curious to know everything that you can tell me about your\ncircumstances. I'm right in assuming, I suppose, that you're--that\nyou're not any too well-fixed.”\n\nThe General helped himself to another little glass of brandy. His mood\nseemed to absorb the spirit of the liqueur. “Fixed!” he repeated with a\npeevish snap in his tone. “I'm not 'fixed' at all, as you call it. Good\nGod, sir! They no more care what becomes of me than they do about\ntheir old gloves. I gave them name and breeding and position--and\neverything--and they round on me like--like cuckoos.” His pale, bulging\neyes lifted their passionless veil for an instant as he spoke, and\nflashed with the predatory fierceness of a hawk.\n\nIntuition helped Thorpe to guess whom “they” might mean. The temper\nvisibly rising in the old man's mind was what he had hoped for. He\nproceeded with an informed caution. “Don't be annoyed if I touch upon\nfamily matters,” he said. “It's a part of what I must know, in order to\nhelp you. I believe you're a widower, aren't you, General?”\n\nThe other, after a quick upward glance, shook his head resentfully.\n“Mrs. Kervick lives in Italy with HER son-in-law--and her daughter.\nHe is a man of property--and also, apparently, a man of remarkable\ncredulity and patience.” He paused, to scan his companion's face.\n“They divide him between them,” he said then, from clenched teeth--“and\nI--mind you--I made the match! He was a young fellow that I found--and I\nbrought him home and introduced him--and I haven't so much as an Italian\npostage-stamp to show for it. But what interest can you possibly take\nin all this?” The unamiable glance of his eyes was on the instant\nsurcharged with suspicion.\n\n“How many daughters have you?” Thorpe ventured the enquiry with inward\ndoubts as to its sagacity.\n\n“Three,” answered the General, briefly. It was evident that he was also\nbusy thinking.\n\n“I ask because I met one of them in the country over Sunday,” Thorpe\ndecided to explain.\n\nThe old soldier's eyes asked many questions in the moment of silence.\n“Which one--Edith?--that is, Lady Cressage?” he enquired. “Of course--it\nwould have been her.”\n\nThorpe nodded. “She made a tremendous impression upon me,” he observed,\nwatching the father with intentness as he let the slow words fall.\n\n“Well she might,” the other replied, simply. “She's supposed to be the\nmost beautiful woman in England.”\n\n“Well--I guess she is,” Thorpe assented, while the two men eyed each\nother.\n\n“Is the third sister unmarried?” it occurred to him to ask. The tone of\nthe question revealed its perfunctory character.\n\n“Oh--Beatrice--she's of no importance,” the father replied. “She goes in\nfor writing, and all that--she's not a beauty, you know--she lives with\nan old lady in Scotland. The oldest daughter--Blanche--she has some good\nlooks of her own, but she's a cat. And so you met Edith! May I ask where\nit was?”\n\n“At Hadlow House--Lord Plowden's place, you know.”\n\nThe General's surprise at the announcement was undoubted. “At\nPlowden's!” he repeated, and added, as if half to himself, “I thought\nthat was all over with, long ago.”\n\n“I wish you'd tell me about it,” said Thorpe, daringly. “I've made it\nplain to you, haven't I? I'm going to look out for you. And I want you\nto post me up, here, on some of the things that I don't understand. You\nremember that it was Plowden who introduced you to me, don't you? It was\nthrough him that you got on the Board. Well, certain things that\nI've seen lead me to suppose that he did that in order to please your\ndaughter. Did you understand it that way?”\n\n“It's quite likely, in one sense,” returned the General. He spoke with\nmuch deliberation now, weighing all his words. “He may have thought\nit would please her; he may not have known how little my poor affairs\nconcerned her.”\n\n“Well, then,” pursued Thorpe, argumentatively, “he had an object in\npleasing her. Let me ask the question--did he want to marry her?”\n\n“Most men want to marry her,” was the father's non-committal response.\nHis moustache lifted itself in the semblance of a smile, but the blue\neyes above remained coldly vigilant.\n\n“Well--I guess that's so too,” Thorpe remarked. He made a fleeting\nmental note that there was something about the General which impelled\nhim to think and talk more like an American than ever. “But was HE\nspecially affected that way?”\n\n“I think,” said Kervick, judicially, “I think it was understood that\nif he had been free to marry a penniless wife, he would have wished to\nmarry her.”\n\n“Do you know,” Thorpe began again, with a kind of diffident\nhesitation--“do you happen to have formed an idea--supposing that had\nbeen the case--would she have accepted him?” “Ah, there you have me,”\n replied the other. “Who can tell what women will accept, and what\nthey will refuse? My daughter refused Lord Lingfield--and he is an\nUnder-Secretary, and will be Earl Chobham, and a Cabinet Minister, and a\nrich man. After that, what are you to say?”\n\n“You speak of her as penniless,” Thorpe remarked, with a casual air.\n\n“Six hundred a year,” the father answered. “We could have rubbed along\nafter a fashion on it, if she had had any notions at all of taking my\nadvice. I'm a man of the world, and I could have managed her affairs for\nher to her advantage, but she insisted upon going off by herself. She\nshowed not the slightest consideration for me--but then I am accustomed\nto that.”\n\nThorpe smiled reflectively, and the old gentleman read in this an\nencouragement to expand his grievances.\n\n“In my position,” he continued, helping himself to still another\ntiny glass, “I naturally say very little. It is not my form to make\ncomplaints and advertise my misfortunes. I daresay it's a fault. I\nknow it kept me back in India--while ever so many whipper-snappers were\npromoted over my head--because I was of the proud and silent sort. It\nwas a mistake, but it was my nature. I might have put by a comfortable\nprovision for my old age, in those days, if I had been willing to push\nmy claims, and worry the Staff into giving me what was my due. But that\nI declined to do--and when I was retired, there was nothing for me but\nthe ration of bread and salt which they serve out to the old soldier\nwho has been too modest. I served my Queen, sir, for forty years--and I\nshould be ashamed to tell you the allowance she makes me in my old age.\nBut I do not complain. My mouth is closed. I am an English gentleman and\none of Her Majesty's soldiers. That's enough said, eh? Do you follow me?\nAnd about my family affairs, I'm not likely to talk to the first comer,\neh? But to you I say it frankly--they've behaved badly, damned badly,\nsir.\n\n“Mrs. Kervick lives in Italy, at the cost of HER son-in-law. He has\nlarge estates in one of the healthiest and most beautiful parts; he has\na palace, and more money than he knows what to do with--but it seems\nthat he's not my son-in-law. I could do with Italy very well--but that\ndoesn't enter into anyone's calculations. No! let the worn-out old\nsoldier sell boot-laces on the kerb! That's the spirit of woman-kind.\nAnd my daughter Edith--does she care what becomes of me? Listen to me--I\nsecured for her the very greatest marriage in England. She would have\nbeen Duchess of Glastonbury today if her husband had not played the fool\nand drowned himself.”\n\n“What's that you say?” put in Thorpe, swiftly.\n\n“It was as good as suicide,” insisted the General, with doggedness. His\nface had become a deeper red. “They didn't hit it off together, and\nhe left in a huff, and went yachting with his father, who was his own\nsailing-master--and, as might be expected, they were both drowned. The\ntitle would have gone to her son--but no, of course, she had no son--and\nso it passed to a stranger--an outsider that had been an usher in a\nschool, or something of that sort. You can fancy what a blow this was to\nme. Instead of being the grandfather of a Duke, I have a childless widow\nthrust back upon my hands! Fine luck, eh? And then, to cap all, she\ntakes her six hundred a year and goes off by herself, and gives me the\ncold shoulder completely. What is it Shakespeare says? 'How sharper than\na serpent's teeth'----”\n\nThorpe brought his fist down upon the table with an emphasis which\nabruptly broke the quotation in half. He had been frowning moodily\nat his guest for some minutes, relighting his cigar more than once\nmeanwhile. He had made a mental calculation of what the old man had had\nto drink, and had reassured himself as to his condition. His garrulity\nmight have an alcoholic basis, but his wits were clear enough. It was\ntime to take a new line with him.\n\n“I don't want to hear you abuse your daughter,” he admonished him now,\nwith a purpose glowing steadily in his firm glance. “Damn it all, why\nshouldn't she go off by herself, and take care of her own money her\nown way? It's little enough, God knows, for such a lady as she is. Why\nshould you expect her to support you out of it? No--sit still! Listen to\nme!”--he stretched out his hand, and laid it with restraining heaviness\nupon the General's arm--“you don't want to have any row with me.\nYou can't afford it. Just think that over to yourself--you--can't\nafford--it.”\n\nMajor-General Kervick's prominent blue eyes had bulged forth in rage\ntill their appearance had disconcerted the other's gaze. They remained\nstill too much in the foreground, as it were, and the angry scarlets\nand violets of the cheeks beneath them carried an unabated threat of\napoplexy--but their owner, after a moment's silence, made a sign with\nhis stiff white brows that the crisis was over. “You must remember\nthat--that I have a father's feelings,” he gasped then, huskily.\n\nThorpe nodded, with a nonchalance which was not wholly affected. He had\nlearned what he wanted to know about this veteran. If he had the fierce\nmeannesses of a famished old dog, he had also a dog's awe of a stick. It\nwas almost too easy to terrorize him.\n\n“Oh, I make allowances for all that,” Thorpe began, vaguely. “But\nit's important that you should understand me. I'm this sort of a man:\nwhatever I set out to do, and put my strength into it, that I do! I kill\nevery pheasant I fire at; Plowden will tell you that! It's a way I have.\nTo those that help me, and are loyal to me, I'm the best friend in\nthe world. To those that get in my way, or try to trip me up, I'm the\ndevil--just plain devil. Now then--you're getting three hundred a year\nfrom my Company, that is to say from me, simply to oblige my friend\nPlowden. You don't do anything to earn this money; you're of no earthly\nuse on the Board. If I chose, I could put you off at the end of the year\nas easily as I can blow out this match. But I propose not only to keep\nyou on, but to make you independent. Why do I do that? You should ask\nyourself that question. It can't be on account of anything you can do\nfor the Company. What else then? Why, first and foremost, because you\nare the father of your daughter.”\n\n“Let me tell you the kind of man I am,” said the General, inflating his\nchest, and speaking with solemnity.\n\n“Oh, I know the kind of man you are,” Thorpe interrupted him, coolly. “I\nwant to talk now.”\n\n“It was merely,” Kervick ventured, in an injured tone, “that I can be as\nloyal as any man alive to a true friend.”\n\n“Well, I'll be the true friend, then,” said Thorpe, with impatient\nfinality. “And now this is what I want to say. I'm going to be a very\nrich man. You're not to say so to anybody, mind you, until the thing\nspeaks for itself. We're keeping dark for a few months, d'ye see?--lying\nlow. Then, as I say, I shall be a very rich man. Well now, I wouldn't\ngive a damn to be rich, unless I did with my money the things that I\nwanted to do, and got the things with it that I wanted to get. Whatever\ntakes my fancy, that's what I'll do.”\n\nHe paused for a moment, mentally to scrutinize a brand-new project which\nseemed, by some surreptitious agency, to have already taken his fancy.\nIt was a curious project; there were attractive things about it, and\nobjections to it suggested themselves as well.\n\n“I may decide,” he began speaking again, still revolving this\nhypothetical scheme in his thoughts--“I may want to--well, here's what\noccurs to me as an off-chance. I take an interest in your daughter, d'ye\nsee? and it seems a low-down sort of thing to me that she should be so\npoor. Well, then--I might say to you, here's two thousand a year, say,\nmade over to you in your name, on the understanding that you turn over\nhalf of it, say, to her. She could take it from you, of course, as her\nfather. You could say you made it out of the Company. Of course it might\nhappen, later on, that I might like to have a gentle hint dropped to\nher, d'ye see, as to where it really came from. Mind, I don't say this\nis what is going to be done. It merely occurred to me.”\n\nAfter waiting for a moment for some comment, he added a second thought:\n“You'd have to set about making friends with her, you know. In any case,\nyou'd better begin at that at once.”\n\nThe General remained buried in reflection. He lighted a cigarette, and\npoured out for himself still another petit verre. His pursed lips and\nknitted brows were eloquent of intense mental activity.\n\n“Well, do you see any objections to it?” demanded Thorpe, at last.\n\n“I do not quite see the reasons for it,” answered the other, slowly.\n“What would you gain by it?”\n\n“How do you mean--gain?” put in the other, with peremptory intolerance\nof tone.\n\nGeneral Kervick spread his hands in a quick little gesture. These hands\nwere withered, but remarkably well-kept. “I suppose one doesn't do\nsomething for nothing,” he said. “I see what I would gain, and what she\nwould gain, but I confess I don't see what advantage you would get out\nof it.”\n\n“No-o, I daresay you don't,” assented Thorpe, with sneering serenity.\n“But what does that matter? You admit that you see what you would gain.\nThat's enough, isn't it?”\n\nThe older man's veined temples twitched for an instant. He straightened\nhimself in his chair, and looked hard at his companion. There was a\nglistening of moisture about his staring eyes.\n\n“It surely isn't necessary--among gentlemen”--he began, cautiously\npicking his phrases--“to have quite so much that's unpleasant, is it?”\n\n“No--you're right--I didn't mean to be so rough,” Thorpe declared, with\nspontaneous contrition. Upon the instant, however, he perceived\nthe danger that advantage might be taken of his softness. “I'm a\nplain-spoken man,” he went on, with a hardening voice, “and people must\ntake me as they find me. All I said was, in substance, that I intended\nto be of service to you--and that that ought to interest you.”\n\nThe General seemed to have digested his pique. “And what I was trying\nto say,” he commented deferentially, “was that I thought I saw ways of\nbeing of service to you. But that did not seem to interest you at all.”\n\n“How--service?” Thorpe, upon consideration, consented to ask.\n\n“I know my daughter so much better than you do,” explained the other; “I\nknow Plowden so much better; I am so much more familiar with the whole\nsituation than you can possibly be--I wonder that you won't listen to\nmy opinion. I don't suggest that you should be guided by it, but I think\nyou should hear it.”\n\n“I think so, too,” Thorpe declared, readily enough. “What IS your\nopinion?”\n\nGeneral Kervick sipped daintily at his glass, and then gave an\nembarrassed little laugh. “But I can't form what you might call an\nopinion,” he protested, apologetically, “till I understand a bit more\nclearly what it is you propose to yourself. You mustn't be annoyed if I\nreturn to that--'still harping on my daughter,' you know. If I MUST ask\nthe question--is it your wish to marry her?”\n\nThorpe looked blankly at his companion, as if he were thinking of\nsomething else. When he spoke, it was with no trace of consciousness\nthat the question had been unduly intimate.\n\n“I can't in the least be sure that I shall ever marry,” he replied,\nthoughtfully. “I may, and I may not. But--starting with that proviso--I\nsuppose I haven't seen any other woman that I'd rather think about\nmarrying than--than the lady we're speaking of. However, you see it's\nall in the air, so far as my plans go.”\n\n“In the air be it,” the soldier acquiesced, plausibly. “Let us consider\nit as if it were in the air--a possible contingency. This is what\nI would say--My--'the lady we are speaking of' is by way of being a\ndifficult lady--'uncertain, coy, and hard to please' as Scott says, you\nknow--and it must be a very skilfully-dressed fly indeed which brings\nher to the surface. She's been hooked once, mind, and she has a horror\nof it. Her husband was the most frightful brute and ruffian, you know. I\nwas strongly opposed to the marriage, but her mother carried it through.\nBut--yes--about her--I think she is afraid to marry again. If she does\never consent, it will be because poverty has broken her nerve. If she is\nkept on six hundred a year, she may be starved, so to speak, into taking\na husband. If she had sixteen hundred--either she would never marry at\nall, or she would be free to marry some handsome young pauper who caught\nher fancy. That would be particularly like her. You would be simply\nendowing some needy fellow, beside losing her for yourself. D'ye\nfollow me? If you'll leave it to me, I can find a much better way than\nthat--better for all of us.”\n\n“Hm!” said Thorpe, and pondered the paternal statement. “I see what you\nmean,” he remarked at last. “Yes--I see.”\n\nThe General preserved silence for what seemed a long time, deferring\nto the reverie of his host. When finally he offered a diversion, in\nthe form of a remark about the hour, Thorpe shook himself, and then\nponderously rose to his feet. He took his hat and coat from the waiter,\nand made his way out without a word.\n\nAt the street door, confronting the waning foliage of the Embankment\ngarden, Kervick was emboldened to recall to him the fact of his\npresence. “Which way are you going?” he asked.\n\n“I don't know,” Thorpe answered absently. “I think--I think I'll take a\nwalk on the Embankment--by myself.”\n\nThe General could not repress all symptoms of uneasiness. “But when am I\nto see you again?” he enquired, with an effect of solicitude that defied\ncontrol.\n\n“See me?” Thorpe spoke as if the suggestion took him by surprise.\n\n“There are things to be settled, are there not?” the other faltered, in\ndistressed doubt as to the judicious tone to take. “You spoke, you know,\nof--of some employment that--that would suit me.”\n\nThorpe shook himself again, and seemed by an effort to recall his\nwandering attention. “Oh yes,” he said, with lethargic vagueness--“I\nhaven't thought it out yet. I'll let you know--within the week,\nprobably.”\n\nWith the briefest of nods, he turned and crossed the road. Walking\nheavily, with rounded shoulders and hands plunged deep in his overcoat\npockets, he went through the gateway, and chose a path at random. To the\nidlers on the garden benches who took note of him as he passed, he\ngave the impression of one struggling with nausea. To his own blurred\nconsciousness, he could not say which stirred most vehemently within\nhim, his loathing for the creature he had fed and bought, or his bitter\nself-disgust.\n\nThe General, standing with exaggerated exactness upon the doorstep,\nhad followed with his bulging eyes the receding figure. He stood still\nregarding the gateway, mentally summarizing the events of the day, after\nthe other had vanished. At last, nestling his chin comfortably into the\nfur of his collar, he smiled with self-satisfaction. “After all,” he\nsaid to himself, “there are always ways of making a cad feel that he is\na cad, in the presence of a gentleman.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nON a Sunday afternoon, early in February, Thorpe journeyed with his\nniece and nephew from Bern to Montreux.\n\nThe young people, with maps and a guide-book open, sat close together at\nthe left side of the compartment. The girl from time to time rubbed the\nsteam from the window with a napkin out of the lunch-basket. They both\nstared a good deal through this window, with frequent exclamations of\npetulance.\n\n“Isn't it too provoking!” cried the girl, turning to her uncle at last.\n“This is where we are now--according to Baedeker: 'As the train proceeds\nwe enjoy a view of the Simmen-Thal and Freiburg mountains to the left,\nthe Moleson being conspicuous.' And look at it! For all one can see, we\nmight as well be at Redhill.”\n\n“It is pretty hard luck,” Thorpe assented, passively glancing past her\nat the pale, neutral-tinted wall of mist which obscured the view. “But\nhang it all--it must clear up some time. Just you have patience, and\nyou'll see some Alps yet.”\n\n“Where we're going,” the young man interposed, “the head-porter told me\nit was always cloudier than anywhere else.”\n\n“I don't think that can be so,” Thorpe reasoned, languidly, from his\ncorner. “It's a great winter resort, I'm told, and it rather stands to\nreason, doesn't it? that people wouldn't flock there if it was so bad as\nall that.”\n\n“The kind of people we've seen travelling in Switzerland,” said the\ngirl--“they would do anything.”\n\nThorpe smiled, with tolerant good humour. “Well, you can comfort\nyourself with the notion that you'll be coming again. The mountains'll\nstay here, all right,” he assured her. The young people smiled back\nat him, and with this he rearranged his feet in a new posture on the\nopposite seat, lighted another cigar, and pillowed his head once more\nagainst the hard, red-plush cushion. Personally, he did not in the least\nresent the failure of the scenery.\n\nFor something more than three months, this purposeless pleasure-tour had\nbeen dragging him about from point to point, sleeping in strange beds,\neating extraordinarily strange food, transacting the affairs of a\nsight-seer among people who spoke strange languages, until he was\nsurfeited with the unusual. It had all been extremely interesting, of\ncourse, and deeply improving--but he was getting tired of talking to\nnobody but waiters, and still more so of having nothing to do which he\ncould not as well leave undone if he chose. After a few days more\nof Switzerland--for they had already gazed with blank faces at this\nuniversal curtain of mist from such different points of view as Lucerne,\nInterlaken, and Thun--it was clear to him that they would, as he\nphrased it, to himself, make a break for home. Unless, indeed, something\nhappened at Montreux. Ah, would anything happen at Montreux? For four\ndays his mind had been automatically reverting to that question; it\nlurked continually in the background of his thoughts, now, as he smoked\nand idly ruminated, on his way southward through the fog.\n\nAll the rest of the prolonged trip had been without any specific motive,\nso far as he was concerned. The youngsters had planned all its routes\nand halts and details of time and connections, and he had gone along,\nwith cheerful placidity, to look at the things they bade him observe,\nand to pay the bills. Perhaps in all things their tastes had not been\nhis tastes. He would have liked more of Paris, he fancied, and less of\nthe small Dutch and North German towns which they seemed to fancy\nso much. Still, the beer was good--and really their happiness, as a\nspectacle, had given him more satisfaction than a thousand miles of\nboulevards could have done.\n\nHe liked this niece and nephew of his more than he could ever have\nimagined himself liking any young people. They had been shy with him at\nthe outset--and for the first week his experiment had been darkened by\nthe belief that, between themselves, they did not deem him quite good\nenough. He had been wise enough, then, to have it out with the girl--she\nwas the one to whom he felt it easiest to talk frankly--and had\ndiscovered, to his immense relief, that they conceived him to be\nregarding them as encumbrances. At breakfast next morning, with tactful\ngeniality, he set everything right, and thereafter they were all\nextremely happy together.\n\nSo far as he could judge, they were very superior young people, both\nintellectually and spiritually. The girl spoke French, and her brother\nGerman, with what seemed to him remarkable proficiency. Their young\nminds were the repositories of an astounding amount of information:\nthey knew who Charles the Bold was; they pointed out to their uncle the\ndistinction between Gothic and Romanesque arches; they explained what\nwas the matter with the Anabaptists; they told him that the story of\nthe Bishop and the rats at Bingen was a baseless myth, and that probably\nthere had never been any such man as William Tell. Nor did they get all\nthis out of the guide-books which they pored over with such zest. It was\nimpossible not to see that they were familiar with large numbers of the\nsubjects that these books discussed, and that the itinerary which\nthey marked out had reference to desires and interests that they had\ncultivated for themselves.\n\nJulia, upon even first sight, made a much pleasanter impression than her\nmother's hesitating description had prepared him for. As he came to know\nher well, he ceased to remember that there was a question in any mind\nas to her being a pretty girl. There was less colour in her face than he\ncould have wished. Her smooth, pallid skin, almost waxen in texture, had\na suggestion of delicate health which sometimes troubled him a little,\nbut which appealed to the tenderness in his nature all the time. The\nface was unduly thin, perhaps, but this, and the wistful glance of the\nlarge grey eyes in repose, made up an effect that Thorpe found touched\nhim a good deal. Even when she was in visibly high spirits, the look in\nthese eyes seemed to him to be laying claim to his protection. She\ncould be merry upon occasion, in a gentle and tranquil way, and as her\nself-confidence expanded under the shelter of their growing intimacy,\nshe disclosed to her uncle plenty of initiative and individuality--but\nwhat he felt in her most was a peculiarly sweet and girlish\ntrustfulness, which made him like himself more than he had ever\ndone before. He could feel that he was at his very best--a hitherto\nunsuspected best--when Julia was about. He wanted to buy for her\neverything in the windows upon which she bestowed the most casual\napproving glance. It was a delight merely to look at her, and to\nmeditate upon the felicity of being able to do things for so charming a\ngirl.\n\nAlfred made a less direct demand upon his uncle's admiration, but he\nwas a very good fellow all round. He was big and fair and muscular,\nand nothing about him but his spectacles seemed in Thorpe's mind to be\nrelated to his choice of art as a profession. That so robust and hearty\na young fellow should wish to put paint on a canvas with small brushes,\nwas to the uncle an unaccountable thing. It was almost as if he had\nwanted to knit, or do embroidery. Of the idleness and impatience of\ndiscipline which his mother had seemed to allege against him, Thorpe\nfailed to detect any signs. The young man was never very late in the\nmorning, and, beside his tireless devotion to the task of hunting up old\npictures in out-of-the-way places, did most of the steward's work of\nthe party with intelligence and precision. He studied the time-tables,\naudited the hotel-bills, looked after the luggage, got up the\nstreet-maps of towns and the like, to such good purpose that they never\nlost a train, or a bag, or themselves. Truly, an excellent young man.\nThorpe noted with especial satisfaction his fine, kindly big-brother\nattitude toward his sister Julia--and it was impossible for him to\navoid the conviction that Louisa was a simpleton not to appreciate such\nchildren. They did not often allude to their mother; when they did, it\nwas in language the terms of which seemed more affectionate than the\ntone--and Thorpe said often to himself that he did not blame them. It\nwas not so much that they had outgrown their mother's point of view.\nThey had never occupied it.\n\nThe journey, so far as Thorpe comprehended its character, had been\nshaped with about equal regard for Julia's interest in the romance of\nhistory, and Alfred's more technical and practical interest in art.\nEach had sufficient sympathy with the tastes of the other, however, to\nprevent any tendency to separation. They took their uncle one day to see\nwhere William the Silent was assassinated, and the next to observe how\nRembrandt's theory of guild portrait-painting differed from Van der\nHelst's, with a common enthusiasm. He scrutinized with patient loyalty\neverything that they indicated to him, and not infrequently they\nappeared to like very much the comments he offered. These were chiefly\nof a sprightly nature, and when Julia laughed over them he felt that she\nwas very near to him indeed.\n\nThus they saw Paris together--where Thorpe did relinquish some of the\nmultiplied glories of the Louvre to sit in front of a cafe by the\nOpera House and see the funny people go past--and thence, by Bruges and\nAntwerp, to Holland, where nobody could have imagined there were as many\npictures as Thorpe saw with his own weary eyes. There were wonderful old\nbuildings at Lubeck for Julia's eyes to glisten over, and pictures at\nBerlin, Dresden, and Dusseldorf for Alfred.\n\nThe assumption existed that the excursion into the Thuringenwald to see\nthe memorials of Luther was especially for the uncle's benefit, and he\ntried solicitously to say or look nothing which might invalidate it.\nThere were other places in Germany, from Mainz to Munich, which he\nremembered best by their different beers. They spent Christmas at\nVienna, where Julia had heard that its observance was peculiarly\ninsisted upon, and then they saw the Tyrol in its heaviest vesture of\nwinter snows, and beautiful old Basle, where Alfred was crazier about\nHolbein than he had been at Munich over Brouwer. Thorpe looked very\ncarefully at the paintings of both men, and felt strengthened in his\nhopes that when Alfred got a little older he would see that this picture\nbusiness was not the thing for a young gentleman with prospects to go\ninto.\n\nIt was at Basle that Thorpe received a letter from London which directly\naltered the plans of the party. He had had several other letters\nfrom London which had produced no such effect. Through Semple, he\nhad followed in outline the unobtrusive campaign to secure a Special\nSettlement, and had learned that the Stock Exchange Committee,\napparently without opposition, had granted one for the first week in\nFebruary.\n\nEven this news, tremendously important as it was, did not prompt Thorpe\nto interfere with the children's projects. There was no longer any point\nin remaining away from London; there were, indeed, numerous reasons\nfor a prompt return. But he was loth to deprive the youngsters of that\ndescent into smiling, sunlit Italy upon which they had so fondly dwelt\nin fancy, and after all Semple could do all that was needful to be done\nfor another month.\n\nSo they went to Basle, and here it was that another kind of letter came.\nIt was in a strange hand, at once cramped and fluttering, which puzzled\nthe recipient a good deal; it was a long time before even the signature\nunravelled itself. Then he forced himself to decipher it, sentence by\nsentence, with a fierce avidity. It was from General Kervick.\n\nThe next morning Thorpe astonished his young companions by suggesting\nan alteration in their route. In a roundabout and tentative fashion--in\nwhich more suspicious observers must have detected something\nshamefaced--he mentioned that he had always heard a great deal about\nMontreux as a winter-resort. The fact that he called it Montroox raised\nin Julia's mind a fleeting wonder from whom it could be that he had\nheard so much about it, but it occurred to neither her nor her brother\nto question his entire good faith. Their uncle had displayed, hitherto,\na most comforting freedom from discrimination among European towns; he\nhad, indeed, assured them many times that they were all one to him. That\nhe should suddenly turn up now with a favourite winter-resort of his\nown selection surprised them considerably, but, upon reflection, it also\npleased them. He had humoured all their wishes with such unfailing\nand bountiful kindness, that it was a delight to learn that there was\nsomething he wanted to do. They could not finish their breakfast till\nthe guide-book had been brought to the table.\n\n“Oh! How splendid!” Julia had cried then. “The Castle of Chillon is\nthere!”\n\n“Why of course!” said Thorpe, complacently.\n\nThey laughed gayly at him for pretending that he had known this, and he\nas good-humouredly accepted their banter. He drew a serious long breath\nof relief, however, when their backs were turned. It had gone off much\nbetter than he had feared.\n\nNow, on this Sunday afternoon, as the train made its sure-footed way\nacross the mountains, the thought that he was actually to alight at\nMontreux at once fascinated and depressed him. He was annoyed with\nhimself for suffering it to get such a hold upon his mind. What was\nthere in it, anyway? There was a big hotel there, and he and his\nyoungsters were to stop at it, and if he accidentally encountered a\ncertain lady who was also stopping there--and of course the meeting\nwould bear upon its face the stamp of pure chance--what of it?\n\nAnd if he did meet her, thus fortuitously--what would happen then? No\ndoubt a lady of her social position met abroad great numbers of people\nthat she had met at home. It would not in any way surprise her--this\nchance encounter of which he thought so much. Were there sufficient\ngrounds for imagining that it would even interest her? He forced his\nmind up to this question, as it were, many times, and invariably it\nshied and evaded the leap.\n\nThere had been times, at Hadlow House, when Lady Cressage had seemed\nsupremely indifferent to the fact of his existence, and there had\nbeen other times when it had appeared manifest that he pleased her--or\nbetter, perhaps, that she was willing to take note of how much she\npleased him. It must have been apparent to her--this fact that\nshe produced such an impression upon him. He reasoned this out\nsatisfactorily to himself. These beautiful women, trained from\nchildhood for the conquest of a rich husband, must have cultivated an\nextraordinary delicacy of consciousness, in such matters. They must have\ndeveloped for themselves what might be called a sixth sense--a power of\nfeeling in the air what the men about were thinking of them. More than\nonce he had caught a glimmer of what he felt to be the operation of this\nsense, in the company of Lady Cressage. He could not say that it had\nbeen discernible in her glance, or her voice, or her manner, precisely,\nbut he was sure that he had seen it, somehow.\n\nBut even assuming all this--admitting that in October, on a wet Sunday,\nin the tedium of a small country-house party, she had shown some\nmomentary satisfaction in the idea that he was profoundly impressed by\nher--did it at all follow that in February, amid the distractions of a\nfashionable winter-resort, and probably surrounded by hosts of friends,\nshe would pay any attention to him whatever? The abject fear that she\nmight not even remember him--might not know him from Adam when he stood\nbefore her--skulked about in the labyrinths of his mind, but he drove it\nback whenever it showed itself. That would be too ignominious.\n\nThe young people at the other side of the compartment, forever wiping\nthe window with the napkin, and straining their eyes to see the\ninvisible, diverted his unsettled attention. A new perception of how\nmuch he liked them and enjoyed having them with him, took hold of his\nthoughts. It had not occurred to him before, with any definiteness, that\nhe would be insupportably lonely when the time came to part with them.\n\nNow, when he dwelt upon it, it made him feel sad and old.\n\nHe said to himself at once, with decision, that there need be no parting\nat all. He would take a house without delay, and they should live with\nhim. He could not doubt that this would be agreeable to them; it would\nsolve every problem for him.\n\nHis fancy sketched out the natural and legitimate extensions of this\nproject. There would be, first of all, a house in town--a furnished\nhouse of a modest sort, having no pretension save to provide a cheerful\ntemporary shelter for three people who liked one another. Here the\nnew household would take shape, and get its right note of character.\nApparently Louisa would not be urged to form part of this household. He\nsaid to himself with frankness that he didn't want her, and there had\nbeen nothing to indicate that her children would pine for her. She\nshowed good sense when she said that her place was in the shop, and\nin her ancestral home over the shop. No doubt there would be a certain\nawkwardness, visible to others if not to themselves, about her living in\none part of London and her children in another. But here also her good\nsense would come on;--and, besides, this furnished house in town would\nbe a mere brief overture to the real thing--the noble country mansion\nhe was going to have, with gardens and horses and hounds and artificial\nlakes and deer parks and everything. Quite within the year he would be\nable to realize this consummation of his dreams.\n\nHow these nice young people would revel in such a place--and how they\nwould worship him for having given it to them for a home! His heart\nwarmed within him as he thought of this. He smiled affectionately at the\npicture Julia made, polishing the glass with vehement circular movements\nof her slight arm, and then grimacing in comic vexation at the deadly\nabsence of landscape outside. Was there ever a sweeter or more lovable\ngirl in this world? Would there have to be some older woman to manage\nthe house, at the beginning? he wondered. He should like it immensely if\nthat could be avoided. Julia looked fragile and inexperienced--but she\nwould be twenty-one next month. Surely that was a mature enough age for\nthe slight responsibility of presiding over servants who should be the\nbest that money could buy. Many girls were married, and given households\nof their own to manage, when they were even younger.\n\nThis reflection raised an obstacle against the smooth-flowing current\nof his thoughts. Supposing that Julia got the notion of marrying--how\nmiserable that would make everything. Very likely she would never do any\nsuch thing; he had observed in her no shadow of a sign that a thought of\nmatrimony had ever crossed her brain. Yet that was a subject upon which,\nof course, she could not be asked to give pledges, even to herself.\n\nThorpe tried to take a liberal view of this matter. He argued to himself\nthat there would be no objection at all to incorporating Julia's husband\ninto the household, assuming that she went to the length of taking one,\nand that he was a good fellow. On this latter point, it was only the\nbarest justice to Julia's tastes and judgment to take it for granted\nthat he would be a good fellow. Yet the uncle felt uneasily that\nthis would alter things for the worse. The family party, with that\nhypothetical young man in it, could never be quite so innocently and\ncompletely happy as--for instance--the family party in this compartment\nhad been during these wonderful three months.\n\nMechanically he rubbed the window beside him, and turned to look out\nwith a certain fixedness--as if he might chance to catch a glimpse of\nthe bridegroom with whom Julia would have it in her power to disturb\nthe serenity of their prospective home. A steep white cliff, receding\nsullenly against the dim grey skyline; a farmhouse grotesquely low for\nits size, crouching under big shelving galleries heaped with snow;\nan opening in front, to the right, where vaguely there seemed to be a\nvalley into which they would descend--he saw these things. They remained\nin his mind afterward as a part of something else that he saw, with\nhis mental vision, at the same moment--a strikingly real and vivid\npresentment of Lady Cressage, attired as he had seen her in the saddle,\nher light hair blown about a little under her hat, a spot of colour\nin the exquisite cheek, the cold, impersonal dignity of a queen in the\nbeautiful profile.\n\nThe picture was so actual for the instant that he uttered an involuntary\nexclamation--and then looked hastily round to see whether his companions\nhad heard it. Seemingly they had not; he lolled again upon the\ncomfortless cushion, and strove to conjure up once more the apparition.\nNothing satisfactory came of the effort. Upon consideration, he grew\nuncertain as to whether he had seen anything at all. At the most it was\na kind of half-dream which had visited him. He yawned at the thought,\nand lighted a fresh cigar. All at once, his mind had become too indolent\nto do any more thinking. A shapeless impression that there would be a\ngood many things to think over later on flitted into his brain and out\nagain.\n\n“Well, how are the mountains using you, now?” he called out to his\nniece.\n\n“Oh, I could shake them!” she declared. “Listen to this: 'A view of\nsingular beauty, embracing the greater part of the Lake of Geneva, and\nthe surrounding mountains, is suddenly disclosed.' That's where we are\nnow--or were a minute ago. You can see that there is some sort of valley\nin front of us--but that is all. If I could only see one mountain with\nsnow on it----”\n\n“Why, it's all mountains and all snow, when you come to that,” Thorpe\ninsisted, with jocose perversity. “You're on mountains yourself, all the\ntime.”\n\n“You know what I mean,” she retorted. “I want to see something like the\ncoloured pictures in the hotels.”\n\n“Oh, probably it will be bright sunlight tomorrow,” he said, for perhaps\nthe twentieth time that day.\n\n“There--that looks like water!” said Alfred. “See? just beyond the\nvillage. Yes, it is water. There's your Lake of Geneva, at all events.”\n\n“But it isn't the right colour,” protested Julia, peering through the\nglass. “It's precisely like everything else: it's of no colour at all.\nAnd they always paint it such a lovely blue! Really, uncle, the Swiss\nGovernment ought to return you your money.”\n\n“You wait till you see it tomorrow--or next day,” said the uncle,\nvaguely. He closed his eyes, and welcomed a drowsy mood. As he went off\nto sleep, the jolting racket of the train mellowed itself into a murmur\nof “tomorrow or next day, tomorrow or next day,” in his ears.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nFROM their windows, high up and at the front of the big hotel, Julia\nlooked down upon the Lake of Geneva. She was in such haste to behold\nit that she had not so much as unbuttoned her gloves; she held her\nmuff still in her hand. After one brief glance, she groaned aloud with\nvexation.\n\nBeyond the roadway, and the deserted miniature pier of Territet, both\ndishevelled under melting and mud-stained snow, there lay a patch of\nwater--motionless, inconspicuous, of a faded drab colour--which at some\nsmall distance out vaguely ceased to look like water and, yet a little\nfurther out, became part and parcel of the dull grey mist. Save for the\nforlorn masts of a couple of fishing boats, beached under the shelter\nof the pier, there was no proof in sight that this was a lake at all. It\nwas as uninspiring to the eye as a pool of drippings from umbrellas in a\nporch.\n\nWhile her uncle and brother occupied themselves with the luggage being\nbrought up by the porters, she opened a window and stepped out upon\nthe tiny balcony. A flaring sign on the inner framework of this balcony\nbesought her in Swiss-French, in the interests of order, not to feed\nthe birds. The injunction seemed meaningless to her until she perceived,\nover by the water, several gulls lazily wheeling about. They were almost\nas grey as the fog they circled in. Suddenly they seemed to perceive\nher in turn, and, swerving sharply, came floating toward the hotel, with\nharsh, almost menacing cries. She hurried in, and shut the window with\ndecision. It seemed to her that the smile with which, as she turned, she\nwas able to meet her uncle's look, was a product of true heroism.\n\nApparently this smile did not altogether delude him. “Oh, now, you\nmustn't get down on your luck,” he adjured her. “We're going to be\nawfully cozy here. Have you seen your room? It's just there, in a little\nalley to the right of the door. They say it has an even finer view\nthan these windows. Oh, you needn't laugh--this is the best view in the\nworld, I'm told by those who know. And as a winter-resort, why----”\n\n“I say, look here!” The interruption came from Alfred, who, having gone\nout on one of the balconies, put in his head now to summon them. “Come\nhere! Here's some fun.”\n\nHe pointed out to Thorpe the meaning of the inscription on the sign, and\nthen pulled him forward to observe its practical defiance. A score of\nbig gulls were flapping and dodging in excited confusion close before\nthem, filling their ears with a painful clamour. Every now and again,\none of the birds, recovering its senses in the hurly-burly, would make a\ncurving swoop downward past the rows of windows below, and triumphantly\ncatch in its beak something that had been thrown into the air.\n\nThorpe, leaning over his railing, saw that a lady on a balcony one floor\nbelow, and some yards to the left, was feeding the birds. She laughed\naloud as she did so, and said something over her shoulder to a companion\nwho was not visible.\n\n“Well, that's pretty cool,” he remarked to his niece, who had come to\nstand beside him. “She's got the same sign down there that we've got. I\ncan see it from here. Or perhaps she can't read French.”\n\n“Or perhaps she isn't frightened of the hotel people,” suggested the\ngirl. She added, after a little, “I think I'll feed them myself in\nthe morning. I certainly shall if the sun comes out--as a sort of\nThanksgiving festival, you know.”\n\nHer uncle seemed not to hear her. He had been struck by the exceptional\ngrace of the gestures with which the pieces of bread were flung forth.\nThe hands and wrists of this lady were very white and shapely. The\nmovements which she made with them, all unaware of observation as she\nwas, and viewed as he viewed them from above, were singularly beautiful\nin their unconstraint. It was in its way like watching some remarkable\nfine dancing, he thought. He could not see much of her face, from his\nperch, but she was tall and fashionably clad. There was a loose covering\nof black lace thrown over her head, but once, as she turned, he could\nsee that her hair was red. Even in this fleeting glimpse, the unusual\ntint attracted his attention: there was a brilliancy as of fire in it.\nSomehow it seemed to make a claim upon his memory. He continued to stare\ndown at the stranger with an indefinable sense that he knew something\nabout her.\n\nSuddenly another figure appeared upon the balcony--and in a flash he\ncomprehended everything. These idiotic, fighting gluttons of gulls\nhad actually pointed out to him the object of his search. It was\nLady Cressage who stood in the doorway, there just below him--and her\ncompanion, the red-haired lady who laughed hotel-rules to scorn, was the\nAmerican heiress who had crossed the ocean in his ship, and whom he\nhad met later on at Hadlow. What was her name--Martin? No--Madden. He\nconfronted the swift impression that there was something odd about these\ntwo women being together. At Hadlow he had imagined that they did not\nlike each other. Then he reflected as swiftly that women probably had\ntheir own rules about such matters. He seemed to have heard, or read,\nperhaps, that females liked and disliked each other with the most\ncapricious alternations and on the least tangible of grounds. At all\nevents, here they were together now. That was quite enough.\n\nThe two ladies had gone in, and closed their window. The sophisticated\nbirds, with a few ungrateful croaks of remonstrance, had drifted away\nagain to the water. His niece had disappeared from his elbow. Still\nThorpe remained with his arms folded on the railing, his eyes fixed on\nthe vacant balcony, below to the left.\n\nWhen at last he went inside, the young people were waiting for him with\nthe project of a stroll before dinner. The light was failing, but there\nwas plenty of time. They had ascertained the direction in which Chillon\nlay; a servant had assured them that it was only a few minutes' walk,\nand Alfred was almost certain that he had seen it from the window.\n\nThorpe assented with a certain listlessness, which they had never noted\nin his manner before, but when Julia begged him not to stir if he were\nin the slightest degree tired, he replied honestly enough that he would\ndo anything rather than be left alone. Then, of course, they said, there\nshould be no walk, but to this he would not listen. The party trooped\ndownstairs, accordingly, and out into the street. The walking was vile,\nbut, as Julia had long ago said, if they were to be deterred by slush\nthey would never get anywhere or see anything.\n\nIt proved to be too late and too dark to either enter the castle or get\nmuch of an idea of its exterior. Returning, they paused again to look\ninto the lighted window of the nice little book-shop. The numerous\nphotographs of what they were entitled to behold from the windows of\ntheir hotel seemed more convincing than photographs usually were. As the\nyoung people inspected them, they became reassured. It was not credible\nthat such a noble vista would forever deny itself to such earnest\npilgrims. When their uncle introduced this time his ancient formula\nabout the certainty of brilliant sunshine in the morning, they somehow\nfelt like believing him.\n\n“Yes--I really think it must change,” Julia declared, with her\nfascinated glance upon the photographs.\n\nAlfred looked at his watch. “We'd better get along to the hotel, hadn't\nwe?” he suggested.\n\n“By the way”--Thorpe began, with a certain uneasiness of\nmanner--“speaking of dinner, wouldn't you like to dine at the big table\nd'hote, instead of up in our sitting-room?”\n\n“If you're tired of our dining alone--by all means,” answered Julia,\nreadily. There was obvious surprise, however, in both her look and tone.\n\n“Tired nothing!” he assured her. “I like it better than anything else in\nthe world. But what I mean is--I was thinking, seeing that this is\nsuch a great winter-resort, and all the swagger people of Europe come\nhere--that probably you youngsters would enjoy seeing the crowd.”\n\nJulia's glance, full of affectionate appreciation, showed how wholly she\ndivined his spirit of self-sacrifice. “We wouldn't care in the least\nfor it,” she declared. “We enjoy being a little party by ourselves every\nwhit as much as you do--and we both hate the people you get at table\nd'hotes--and besides, for that matter, if there are any real swells\nhere, you may be sure they dine in their own rooms.”\n\n“Why, of course!” Thorpe exclaimed swiftly, in palpable self-rebuke. “I\ndon't know what I could have been thinking of. Of course they would dine\nin their rooms.”\n\nNext morning, Thorpe rose earlier than ever--with the impression of a\npeculiarly restless and uncomfortable night behind him. It was not until\nhe had shaved and dressed that he noted the altered character of the\nair outside. Although it was not fully daylight yet, he could see the\noutlines of the trees and vinerows on the big, snow-clad hill, which\nmonopolized the prospect from his window, all sharp and clear cut, as if\nhe were looking at them through an opera-glass. He went at once to the\nsitting-room, and thrust the curtains aside from one of the windows.\n\nA miracle had been wrought in the night. The sky overhead was serenely\ncloudless; the lake beneath, stirring softly under some faint passing\nbreeze, revealed its full breadth with crystalline distinctness. Between\nsky and water there stretched across the picture a broad, looming,\ndimly-defined band of shadow, marked here and there at the top by\nlittle slanting patches of an intensely glowing white. He looked at this\ndarkling middle distance for a moment or two without comprehension. Then\nhe turned and hurriedly moved to the door of Julia's room and beat upon\nit.\n\n“Get up!” he called through the panels. “Here's your sunrise--here's\nyour Alpine view. Go to your window and see it!”\n\nA clear voice, not unmirthful, replied: “I've been watching it for half\nan hour, thanks. Isn't it glorious?”\n\nHe was more fortunate at the opposite door, for Alfred was still\nasleep. The young man, upon hearing the news, however, made a toilet of\nunexampled brevity, and came breathlessly forth. Thorpe followed him\nto the balcony, where he stood collarless and uncombed, with the fresh\nmorning breeze blowing his hair awry, his lips parted, his eyes staring\nwith what the uncle felt to be a painful fixedness before him.\n\nThorpe had seen many mountains in many lands. They did not interest him\nvery much. He thought, however, that he could see now why people who\nhad no mountains of their own should get excited about Switzerland. He\nunderstood a number of these sentimental things now, for that matter,\nwhich had been Greek to him three months before. Unreceptive as his\nphilistinism may have seemed to these delightful youngsters, it was\napparent enough to him that they had taught him a great deal. If he\ncould not hope to share their ever-bubbling raptures and enthusiasms,\nat least he had come to comprehend them after a fashion, and even to\ndiscern sometimes what it was that stirred them.\n\nHe watched his nephew now--having first assured himself by a\ncomprehensive downward glance that no other windows of the hotel-front\nwere open. The young man seemed tremendously moved, far too much so to\ntalk. Thorpe ventured once some remarks about the Mexican mountains,\nwhich were ever so much bigger, as he remembered them, but Alfred paid\nno heed. He continued to gaze across the lake, watching in rapt silence\none facet after another catch the light, and stand out from the murky\ngloom, radiantly white, till at last the whole horizon was a mass of\nshining minarets and domes, and the sun fell full on his face. Then,\nwith a long-drawn sigh, he turned, re-entered the room, and threw\nhimself into a chair.\n\n“It's too good!” he declared, with a half-groan. “I didn't know it would\nbe like that.”\n\n“Why nothing's too good for us, man,” his uncle told him.\n\n“THAT is,” said the boy, simply, and Thorpe, after staring for a moment,\nsmiled and rang the bell for breakfast.\n\nWhen Julia made her appearance, a few minutes later, the table was\nalready laid, and the waiter was coming in with the coffee.\n\n“I thought we'd hurry up breakfast,” her uncle explained, after she\nhad kissed him and thanked him for the sunrise he had so successfully\npredicted--“because I knew you'd both be crazy to get out.”\n\nHe had not over-estimated their eagerness, which was so great, indeed,\nthat they failed to note the excessive tranquility of his own demeanour.\nHe ate with such unusual deliberation, on this exciting morning, that\nthey found themselves at the end of their repast when, apparently, he\nhad but made a beginning.\n\n“Now you mustn't wait for me at all,” he announced to them then. “I'm a\nlittle tired this morning--and I think I'd just like to lie around and\nsmoke, and perhaps read one of your novels. But you two must get your\nthings on and lose no time in getting out. This is the very best time of\nday, you know--for Alpine scenery. I'd hate to have you miss any of it.”\n\nUnder his kindly if somewhat strenuous insistence, they went to their\nrooms to prepare for an immediate excursion. He was so anxious to have\nthem see all there was to be seen that, when Julia returned, properly\ncloaked and befurred, and stood waiting at the window, he scolded a\nlittle.\n\n“What on earth is that boy doing?” he exclaimed, with a latent snarl in\nhis tone which was novel to her ear. “He'll keep you here till noon!”\n\n“He's shaving, I think. He won't be long,” she replied, with great\ngentleness. After a moment's pause, she turned from the window and came\ngayly forward.\n\n“Oh, I forgot: I was going to feed the birds. There are several of them\nout there now.” As she spoke, she busily broke up some of the rolls on\nthe table. Her face was bright with the pleasure of the thought.\n\n“If you don't much mind, Julia,” her uncle began, with almost pleading\nintonations, “I rather think I wouldn't feed those birds. The rule is\nthere before our eyes, you know--and it's always been my idea that if\nyou're at a hotel it's the correct thing to abide by its rules. It's\njust an idea of mine--and I daresay, if you think about it, you'll feel\nthe same way.”\n\nThe girl freed the last remaining bread-crumb from her gloves. “Why, of\ncourse, uncle,” she said, with promptitude.\n\nAlthough there was no hint of protest in her tone or manner, he felt\nimpelled to soften still further this solitary demonstration of his\nauthority. “You see I've been all round the world, my little girl,” he\nexplained, haltingly, “and when a man's done that, and knocked about\neverywhere, he's apt to get finicking and notional about trifles every\nonce in a while.”\n\n“You're less so than anybody I ever knew,” she generously interposed.\n\n“Oh, no I'm not. You don't know me well enough yet; that's what's the\nmatter. And you see, Julia--another thing just because you saw that lady\nthrowing out bread, that aint a very good reason why you should do it.\nYou don't know what kind of a person she may be. Girls have got to be so\nfrightfully careful about all that sort of thing.”\n\nJulia offered a constrained little laugh in comment. “Oh, you don't know\nhow careful I can be,” she said.\n\n“But you're not annoyed?” he entreated her--and for answer she came\nbehind him, and rested an arm on his shoulder, and patted it. He stroked\nher hand with his own. “That's something like the nicest niece in the\nworld!” he exclaimed, with fervour.\n\nWhen at last she and her brother had gone, he made short work of his\nbreakfast, and drank his coffee at a gulp. A restless activity suddenly\ninformed his movements. He lit a cigar, and began pacing up and down the\nroom, biting his lips in preoccupation as he went. After a little, he\nopened a window, and ventured cautiously as far out on the balcony\nas was necessary to obtain a view of the street below. Eventually, he\nidentified his nephew and niece among the pedestrians beneath him, and\nhe kept them in sight till, after more than one tiresome halt at a shop\nwindow, they disappeared round a bend in the road. Then he turned and\ncame back into the room with the buoyant air of a man whose affairs are\nprospering.\n\nHe smiled genially to himself as he gathered from the table in one\ncapacious hand all the pieces of bread his beloved niece had broken\nup, and advanced again to the open window. Waiting here till one of the\ndingy gulls moving aimlessly about was headed toward him, he tossed out\na fragment. The bird dashed at it with a scream, and on the instant the\nwhole squawking flock were on wing. He suffered the hubbub to proceed\nunappeased for a little while he kept a watchful though furtive eye\non that balcony to the left, below. Unhappily he could not get out far\nenough to see whether the inner curtains of its window were drawn. He\nthrew another bit of bread, and then looked at his watch. It was a few\nminutes past nine. Surely people travelling to see scenery would be up\nby this hour.\n\nThe strategy of issuing just enough bread to keep the feathered\nconcourse in motion commended itself to his mind. As a precautionary\nmeasure, he took all the rolls remaining on the table, and put them in\nthe drawer of a desk by the window. It even occurred to him to ring for\nmore bread, but upon consideration that seemed too daring. The waiter\nwould be sufficiently surprised at the party's appetites as it was.\n\nHalf an hour later, his plan of campaign suddenly yielded a victory.\nLady Cressage appeared on her balcony, clad in some charming sort of\nmorning gown, and bareheaded. She had nothing in her hands, and seemed\nindifferent to the birds, but when Thorpe flung forth a handful of\nfragments into the centre of their whirling flock, she looked up at him.\nIt was the anxious instant, and he ventured upon what he hoped was a\ndecorous compromise between a bow and a look of recognition.\n\nShe was in no haste to answer either. He could see rather than hear\nthat she said something to her invisible companion within, the while she\nglanced serenely in the general direction of his balcony. It seemed to\nhim that the answer to her remark, whatever it was, must have exerted\na direct influence upon his destiny, for Lady Cressage all at once\nfocussed her vague regard upon him, and nodded with a reasonably\ngracious smile.\n\n“It's wonderful luck to find you here,” he called down to her. Having\nplayed their part, he wished now that the birds were at Jericho. Their\nobstreperous racket made conversation very difficult. Apparently she\nmade him an answer, but he could catch nothing of it.\n\n“I'm here with my niece and nephew,” he shouted down. “I don't hear what\nyou say. May I come down and pay my respects--later on? What is your\nnumber, and when may I come?”\n\nThese questions, as he flashed them in review through his mind, seemed\nto be all right from the most exacting social point of view. Doubtless\nit was equally all right that, before replying, she should consult her\ncompanion, as she did at some length. Then she replied--and he had no\ndifficulty now in hearing her above the birds--that it would be\nvery nice of him to come, say, in an hour's time. She told him the\nnumber--and then almost abruptly went in.\n\nThorpe, during this hour that ensued, smoked with volcanic energy. He\ntried to interest himself in one after another of half a dozen Tauchnitz\nnovels his niece carried about, with a preposterous absence of success.\nHe strove to arrange in some kind of sequence the things that he should\nsay, when this momentous interview should begin, but he could think of\nnothing which did not sound silly. It would be all right, he argued to\nhimself in the face of this present mental barrenness; he always talked\nwell enough on the spur of the moment, when the time came--and still was\nnot reassured.\n\nHe wondered if both ladies would be there to receive him, and\ndecided that they would probably regard that as indispensable to the\nproprieties. In that case, their conversation would necessarily be of\nthe most casual and general character. He would tell them a good deal\nabout his niece, he foresaw. A man travelling about with a niece--and\nsuch a delightfully lady-like and engaging little niece--would take on\nsome added interest and dignity, he perceived, in the eyes of ladies\ntravelling alone. He essayed to estimate just how much they would\nprobably like Julia. Of course he would say nothing about her mother and\nthe book-shop; a vague allusion to a widowed sister would be ample on\nthat head. But there could be confident references to Cheltenham; he\nknew from what Julia had said that it suggested the most satisfactory\nsocial guarantees, if taken strictly by itself. And then so much would\ndepend upon Julia herself! If she succeeded in striking up a friendship\nwith them--ah, then everything would be all right. Perhaps they would\ntake a fancy to Alfred too! He was a boy, of course, but conceivably the\nfact that he wanted to paint, and knew about pictures, would appeal to\nthem. He seemed to have heard somewhere that artists were the very devil\namong women.\n\nAt last the weary time of waiting had worn itself out, somehow, and,\nafter a final polishing before his glass, he went down, and found his\nright corridor, and knocked at the door. A pleasant voice bade him\nenter, and, hat and gloves in hand, he went in.\n\nAs he had imagined, both ladies were present. He had not been prepared,\nhowever, for the fact that it was the American who played the part of\nhostess. It was she who received him, and invited him to sit down, and\ngenerally made him free of the apartment. When he shook hands with Lady\nCressage, there was somehow an effect of the incidental in the ceremony,\nas if she were also a guest.\n\nNothing could have been simpler or more pleasing than the little visit\nturned out to be. Miss Madden had suddenly grown tired of the snowless\nand dripping English winter, and had as promptly decided to come to\nSwitzerland, where the drifts ought to be high enough, and the frosts\nsearching enough, in all conscience. They had selected Territet, because\nit was familiar to her, and because it was on the way to Martigny and\nBrieg, and she had had a notion of crossing either the Simplon or the\nSt. Bernard in winter. As she found now, the St. Bernard was quite\nimpracticable, but admittedly a post road was kept open over the\nSimplon. It was said now that she would not be allowed to proceed by\nthis, but it often happened that she did the things that she was not\nallowed to do. The hotel-people at both Brieg and Berisal had written\nrefusing to let their horses attempt the Simplon journey, and they were\nof course quite within their rights, but there were other horses in\nSwitzerland. One surely could buy horses--and so on.\n\nThorpe also had his turn at autobiography. He told rather whimsically\nof his three months' experiences at the tail of the juvenile whirligigs,\nand his auditors listened to them with mild smiles. He ventured upon\nnumerous glowing parentheses about Julia, and they at least did not say\nthat they did not want to know her. They heard with politeness, too,\nwhat he could contrive to drag in about his artist-nephew, and said it\nmust be very pleasant for him to have such nice company. At least Miss\nMadden said this: her companion, as he thought it over afterward, seemed\nhardly to have said anything at all. She answered the few remarks which\nhe found it possible to direct to her, but the responses took no hold\nupon his memory. He fancied that she was bored, or unhappy, or both.\n\nFinally, in the midst of commonplaces which, to his apprehension, were\nverging upon flatness, a bold inspiration disclosed itself--as\nsplendid as the Dent du Midi revealing its glaciers above the mounting\nsunrise--in his brain.\n\n“We should all be charmed if you would come up and dine with us\ntonight,” he said, under the abrupt impulsion of this idea. “It's been\nsuch an age since we wanderers have had the privilege of company at our\ntable!”\n\nThe felicity of these phrases from his lips attracted his admiring\nattention, even while he waited in suspense for an answer to them.\n\nThe ladies exchanged a look. “Yes,” said Miss Madden, after the\nslightest of pauses, “we shall be very happy.”\n\nShortly thereafter Thorpe took his leave, and went downstairs and out.\nHe wandered about till luncheon time, observing the mountains across the\nlake from various standpoints, and, as it were, with new eyes. He was\ninterested in them in a curious new fashion; they seemed to say things\nto him. His lip curled once at the conceit that he was one of the Alps\nhimself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nIT did not happen until three days later that Thorpe's opportunity to\nspeak alone with Lady Cressage came.\n\nIn this brief period, the two parties seemed to have become fused in a\nremarkable intimacy. This was clearly due to the presence of the young\npeople, and Thorpe congratulated himself many times each day upon the\nstriking prescience he had shown in bringing them.\n\nBoth the ladies unaffectedly liked Julia; so much so that they seemed\nunwilling to make any plans which did not include her. Then it was only\na matter of course that where she went her brother should go--and a\nfurther logical step quite naturally brought in their willing uncle. If\nhe had planned everything, and now was ordering everything, it could not\nhave gone more to his liking.\n\nCertain side speculations lent a savour to the satisfaction with which\nhe viewed this state of affairs. He found many little signs to confirm\nthe suspicion that the two ladies had been the readier to make much of\nJulia because they were not overkeen about each other's society. The\nbright, sweet-natured girl had come as a welcome diversion to a couple\nwho in seclusion did battle with tendencies to yawn. He was not quite\nconvinced, for that matter, that the American lady always went to that\ntrouble. She seemed to his observation a wilful sort of person, who\nwould not be restrained by small ordinary considerations from doing the\nthings she wanted to do. Her relations with her companion afforded him\nfood for much thought. Without any overt demonstrations, she produced\nthe effect of ordering Lady Cressage about. This, so far as it went,\ntended to prejudice him against her. On the other hand, however, she was\nso good to Julia, in a peculiarly frank and buoyant way which fascinated\nthe girl, that he could not but like her. And she was very good to\nAlfred too.\n\nThere was, indeed, he perceived, a great deal of individuality about the\nfriendship which had sprung up between Miss Madden and his nephew. She\nwas years his senior--he settled it with himself that the American could\nnot be less than seven-and-twenty,--yet Alfred stole covert glances of\nadmiration at her, and seemed to think of nothing but opportunities for\nbeing in her company as if--as if--Thorpe hardly liked to complete the\ncomparison in his own thoughts. Alfred, of course, said it was all on\naccount of her wonderful hair; he rather went out of his way to\ndilate upon the enthusiasm her “colour scheme”--whatever that might\nmean--excited in him as an artist. The uncle had moments of profound\nskepticism about this--moments when he uneasily wondered whether it was\nnot going to be his duty to speak to the young man. For the most part,\nhowever, he extracted reassurance from Miss Madden's demeanour toward\nthe lad. She knew, it seemed, a vast deal about pictures; at least she\nwas able to talk a vast deal about them, and she did it in such a calmly\ndogmatic fashion, laying down the law always, that she put Alfred in the\nposition of listening as a pupil might listen to a master. The humility\nwith which his nephew accepted this position annoyed Thorpe upon\noccasion, but he reasoned that it was a fault on the right side. Very\nlikely it would help to keep the fact of the lady's seniority more\nclearly before the youngster's mind, and that would be so much gained.\n\nAnd these apprehensions, after all, were scarcely to be counted in the\nbalance against the sense of achieved happiness with which these halcyon\ndays kept Thorpe filled. The initiatory dinner had gone off perfectly.\nHe could have wished, indeed, that Julia had a smarter frock, and more\nrings, when he saw the imposing costumes and jewelled throats and hands\nof his guests--but she was a young girl, by comparison, he reflected,\nand there could be no doubt that they found her charming. As for Alfred,\nhe was notably fine-looking in his evening-clothes--infinitely more like\nthe son of a nobleman, the gratified uncle kept saying to himself,\nthan that big dullard, the Honourable Balder. It filled him with a new\npleasure to remember that Alfred had visiting cards presenting his name\nas D'Aubigny, which everybody of education knew was what the degenerate\nDabney really stood for. The lad and his sister had united upon this\nexcellent change long ago at Cheltenham, and oddly enough they had\nconfessed it to their uncle, at the beginning of the trip, with a show\nof trepidation, as if they feared his anger. With radiant gayety he\nhad relieved their minds by showing them his card, with “Mr. Stormont\nThorpe” alone upon it. At the dinner table, in the proudest moment\nof his life, he had made himself prouder still by thinking how\ndistinguished an appearance his and Alfred's cards would make together\nin the apartment below next day.\n\nBut next day, the relations between the two parties had already become\ntoo informal for cards. Julia went down to see them; they came up to see\nJulia. Then they all went for a long walk, with luncheon at Vevey, and\nbefore evening Alfred was talking confidently of painting Miss Madden.\nNext day they went by train to St. Maurice, and, returning after dark,\ndined without ceremony together. This third day--the weather still\nremaining bright--they had ascended by the funicular road to Glion, and\nwalked on among the swarming luegers, up to Caux. Here, after luncheon,\nthey had wandered about for a time, regarding the panorama of lake and\nmountains. Now, as the homeward descent began, chance led the two young\npeople and Miss Madden on ahead.\n\nThorpe found himself walking beside Lady Cressage. He had upon his arm\nher outer wrap, which she said she would put on presently. To look at\nthe view he must glance past her face: the profile, under the graceful\nfur cap, was so enriched by glowing colour that it was, to his thought,\nas if she were blushing.\n\n“How little I thought, a few months ago,” he said, “that we should be\nmountaineering together!”\n\n“Oh, no one knows a day ahead,” she responded, vaguely. “I had probably\nless notion of coming to Switzerland then than you had.”\n\n“Then you don't come regularly?”\n\n“I have never seen either Germany or Switzerland before. I have scarcely\nbeen out of England before.”\n\n“Why now”--he paused, to think briefly upon his words--“I took it for\ngranted you were showing Miss Madden around.”\n\n“It 's quite the other way about,” she answered, with a cold little\nlaugh. “It is she who is showing me around. It is her tour. I am the\nchaperone.” Thorpe dwelt upon the word in his mind. He understood what\nit meant only in a way, but he was luminously clear as to the bitterness\nof the tone in which it had been uttered.\n\n“No--it didn't seem as if it were altogether--what I might call--YOUR\ntour,” he ventured. They had seen much of each other these past few\ndays, but it was still hard for him to make sure whether their freedom\nof intercourse had been enlarged.\n\nThe slight shrug of the shoulders with which, in silence, she commented\nupon his remark, embarrassed him. For a moment he said nothing. He went\non then with a renewed consciousness of risk.\n\n“You mustn't be annoyed with me,” he urged. “I've been travelling with\nthat dear little niece of mine and her brother, so long, that I've\ngot into a habit of watching to notice if the faces I see round me are\nhappy. And when they're not, then I have a kind of fatherly notion of\ninterfering, and seeing what's wrong.”\n\nShe smiled faintly at this, but when he added, upon doubtful\ninspiration--“By the way, speaking of fathers, I didn't know at Hadlow\nthat you were the daughter of one of my Directors”--this smile froze\nupon the instant.\n\n“The Dent du Midi is more impressive from the hotel, don't you think?”\n she remarked, “than it is from here.”\n\nUpon consideration, he resolved to go forward. “I have taken a great\ninterest in General Kervick,” he said, almost defiantly. “I am seeing to\nit that he has a comfortable income--an income suitable to a gentleman\nof his position--for the rest of his life.”\n\n“He will be very glad of it,” she remarked.\n\n“But I hoped that you would be glad of it too,” he told her, bluntly. A\ncurious sense of reliance upon his superiority in years had come to him.\nIf he could make his air elderly and paternal enough, it seemed likely\nthat she would defer to it. “I'm talking to you as I would to my niece,\nyou know,” he added, plausibly.\n\nShe turned her head to make a fleeting survey of his face, as if the\npoint of view took her by surprise. “I don't understand,” she said. “You\nare providing an income for my father, because you wish to speak to me\nlike an uncle. Is that it?”\n\nHe laughed, somewhat disconsolately. “No--that isn't it,” he said, and\nlaughed again. “I couldn't tell, you know, that you wouldn't want to\ntalk about your father.” “Why, there's no reason in the world for not\ntalking of him,” she made haste to declare. “And if he's got something\ngood in the City, I'm sure I'm as glad as anyone. He is the sort that\nought always to have a good deal of money. I mean, it will bring out his\nmore amiable qualities. He does not shine much in adversity--any more\nthan I do.”\n\nThorpe felt keenly that there were fine things to be said here--but he\nhad confidence in nothing that came to his tongue. “I've been a poor man\nall my life--till now,” was his eventual remark.\n\n“Please don't tell me that you have been very happy in your poverty,”\n she adjured him, with the dim flicker of a returning smile. “Very likely\nthere are people who are so constituted, but they are not my kind. I\ndon't want to hear them tell about it. To me poverty is the horror--the\nunmentionable horror!”\n\n“There never was a day that I didn't feel THAT!” Thorpe put fervour into\nhis voice. “I was never reconciled to it for a minute. I never ceased\nswearing to myself that I'd pull myself out of it. And that's what\nmakes me sort of soft-hearted now toward those--toward those who haven't\npulled themselves out of it.”\n\n“Your niece says you are soft-hearted beyond example,” remarked Lady\nCressage.\n\n“Who could help being, to such a sweet little girl as she is?” demanded\nthe uncle, fondly.\n\n“She is very nice,” said the other. “If one may say such a thing, I\nfancy these three months with her have had an appreciable effect upon\nyou. I'm sure I note a difference.”\n\n“That's just what I've been saying to myself!” he told her. He was\nvisibly delighted with this corroboration. “I've been alone practically\nall my life. I had no friends to speak of--I had no fit company--I\nhadn't anything but the determination to climb out of the hole. Well,\nI've done that--and I've got among the kind of people that I naturally\nlike. But then there came the question of whether they would like me. I\ntell you frankly, that was what was worrying the heart out of me when I\nfirst met you. I like to be confessing it to you now--but you frightened\nme within an inch of my life. Well now, you see, I'm not scared of you\nat all. And of course it's because Julia's been putting me through a\ncourse of sprouts.”\n\nThe figure was lost upon Lady Cressage, but the spirit of the remarks\nseemed not unpleasant to her. “I'm sure you're full of kindness,”\n she said. “You must forget that I snapped at you--about papa.” “All I\nremember about that is,” he began, his eye lighting up with the thought\nthat this time the opportunity should not pass unimproved, “that you\nsaid he didn't shine much in adversity---any more than you did. Now on\nthat last point I disagree with you, straight. There wouldn't be any\nplace in which you wouldn't shine.”\n\n“Is that the way one talks to one's niece?” she asked him, almost\nlistlessly. “Such flattery must surely be bad for the young.” Her words\nwere sprightly enough, but her face had clouded over. She had no heart\nfor the banter.\n\n“Ah”--he half-groaned. “I only wish I knew what was the right way to\ntalk to you. The real thing is that I see you're unhappy--and that gets\non my nerve--and I should like to ask you if there wasn't something\nI could do--and ask it in such a way that you'd have to admit there\nwas--and I don't know enough to do it.”\n\nHe had a wan smile for thanks. “But of course there is nothing,” she\nreplied, gently.\n\n“Oh, there must be!” he insisted. He had no longer any clear notions as\nto where his tongue might not lead him. “There must be! You said I might\ntalk to you as I would to Julia.”\n\n“Did I?”\n\n“Well, I'm going to, anyway,” he went on stoutly, ignoring the note of\ndefinite dissent in her interruption. “You ARE unhappy! You spoke about\nbeing a chaperone. Well now, to speak plainly, if it isn't entirely\npleasant for you with Miss Madden--why wouldn't you be a chaperone for\nJulia? I must be going to London very soon--but she can stay here, or go\nto Egypt, or wherever she likes--and of course you would do everything,\nand have everything--whatever you liked, too.”\n\n“The conversation is getting upon rather impossible grounds, I'm\nafraid,” she said, and then bit her lips together. Halting, she frowned\na little in the effort of considering her further words, but there was\nnothing severe in the glance which she lifted to him as she began\nto speak. “Let us walk on. I must tell you that you misconceive the\nsituation entirely. Nobody could possibly be kinder or more considerate\nthan Miss Madden. Of course she is American--or rather Irish-American,\nand I'm English, and our notions and ways are not always alike. But\nthat has nothing to do with it. And it is not so much that she has\nmany thousands a year, and I only a few hundreds. That in itself would\nsignify nothing--and if I must take help from somebody I would rather\ntake it from Celia Madden than anybody else I know--but this is the\npoint, Mr. Thorpe. I do not eat the bread of dependence gracefully. I\npull wry faces over it, and I don't try very much to disguise them. That\nis my fault. Yes--oh yes, I know it is a fault--but I am as I am. And\nif Miss Madden doesn't mind--why”--she concluded with a mirthless,\nuncertain laugh--“why on earth should you?”\n\n“Ah, why should I?” he echoed, reflectively. “I should like desperately\nto tell you why. Sometime I will tell you.”\n\nThey walked on in silence for a brief space. Then she put out her hand\nfor her wrap, and as she paused, he spread it over her shoulders.\n\n“I am amazed to think what we have been saying to each other,” she said,\nbuttoning the fur as they moved on again. “I am vexed with myself.”\n\n“And more still with me,” he suggested.\n\n“No-o--but I ought to be. You've made me talk the most shocking\nrubbish.”\n\n“There we disagree again, you know. Everything you've said's been\nperfect. What you're thinking of now is that I'm not an old enough\nfriend to have been allowed to hear it. But if I'm not as old a friend\nas some, I wish I could make you feel that I'm as solid a friend as\nany--as solid and as staunch and as true. I wish I could hear you say\nyou believed that.”\n\n“But you talk of 'friends,'” she said, in a tone not at all\nresponsive--“what is meant by 'friends'? We've chanced to meet\ntwice--and once we barely exchanged civilities, and this time we've been\nhotel acquaintances--hardly more, is it?--and you and your young people\nhave been very polite to me--and I in a silly moment have talked to\nyou more about my affairs than I should--I suppose it was because you\nmentioned my father. But 'friends' is rather a big word for that, isn't\nit?”\n\nThorpe pouted for a dubious moment. “I can think of a bigger word\nstill,” he said, daringly. “It's been on the tip of my tongue more than\nonce.”\n\nShe quickened her pace. The air had grown perceptibly colder. The\ndistant mountains, visible ever and again through the bare branches,\nwere of a dark and cheerless blue, and sharply defined against the sky.\nIt was not yet the sunset hour, and there were no mists, but the light\nof day seemed to be going out of the heavens. He hurried on beside her\nin depressed silence.\n\nTheir companions were hidden from view in a convolution of the winding\nroad, but they were so near that their voices could be heard as they\ntalked. Frequently the sound of laughter came backward from them.\n\n“They're jolly enough down there,” he commented at last, moodily.\n\n“That's a good reason for our joining them, isn't it?” Her tone was at\nonce casual and pointed.\n\n“But I don't want to join them!” he protested. “Why don't you stay with\nme--and talk?” “But you bully me so,” she offered in explanation.\n\nThe phrase caught his attention. Could it be that it expressed her\nreal feeling? She had said, he recalled, that he had made her talk. Her\ncomplaint was like an admission that he could overpower her will. If\nthat were true--then he had resources of masterfulness still in reserve\nsufficient to win any victory.\n\n“No--not bully you,” he said slowly, as if objecting to the word rather\nthan the idea. “That wouldn't be possible to me. But you don't know me\nwell enough to understand me. I am the kind of man who gets the things\nhe wants. Let me tell you something: When I was at Hadlow, I had never\nshot a pheasant in my life. I used to do tolerably well with a rifle,\nbut I hardly knew anything about a shot-gun, and I don't suppose I'd\never killed more than two or three birds on the wing--and that was ages\nago. But I took the notion that I would shoot better than anybody else\nthere. I made up my mind to it--and I simply did it, that's all. I don't\nknow if you remember--but I killed a good deal more than both the others\nput together. I give you that as an example. I wanted you to think that\nI was a crack shot--and so I made myself be a crack shot.”\n\n“That is very interesting,” she murmured. They did not seem to be\nwalking quite so fast.\n\n“Don't think I want to brag about myself,” he went on. “I don't fancy\nmyself--in that way. I'm not specially proud of doing things--it's the\nthings themselves that I care for. If some men had made a great fortune,\nthey would be conceited about it. Well, I'm not. What I'm keen about is\nthe way to use that fortune so that I will get the most out of it--the\nmost happiness, I mean. The thing to do is to make up your mind\ncarefully what it is that you want, and to put all your power and\nresolution into getting it--and the rest is easy enough. I don't think\nthere's anything beyond a strong man's reach, if he only believes enough\nin himself.”\n\n“But aren't you confusing two things?” she queried. The subject\napparently interested her. “To win one's objects by sheer personal force\nis one thing. To merely secure them because one's purse is longer than\nother people's--that's quite another matter.”\n\nHe smiled grimly at her. “Well, I'll combine the two,” he said.\n\n“Then I suppose you will be altogether irresistible,” she said, lightly.\n“There will be no pheasants left for other people at all.”\n\n“I don't mind being chaffed,” he told her, with gravity. “So long as\nyou're good-natured, you can make game of me all you like. But I'm in\nearnest, all the same. I'm not going to play the fool with my money and\nmy power. I have great projects. Sometime I'll tell you about them. They\nwill all be put through--every one of them. And you wouldn't object to\ntalking them over with me--would you?”\n\n“My opinion on 'projects' is of no earthly value--to myself or anyone\nelse.”\n\n“But still you'd give me your advice if I asked it?” he persisted.\n“Especially if it was a project in which you were concerned?”\n\nAfter a moment's constrained silence she said to him, “You must have\nno projects, Mr. Thorpe, in which I am concerned. This talk is all very\nwide of the mark. You are not entitled to speak as if I were mixed up\nwith your affairs. There is nothing whatever to warrant it.”\n\n“But how can you help being in my projects if I put you there, and keep\nyou there?” he asked her, with gleeful boldness. “And just ask yourself\nwhether you do really want to help it. Why should you? You've seen\nenough of me to know that I can be a good friend. And I'm the kind of\nfriend who amounts to something--who can and will do things for those he\nlikes. What obligation are you under to turn away that kind of a friend,\nwhen he offers himself to you? Put that question plainly to yourself.”\n\n“But you are not in a position to nominate the questions that I am to\nput to myself,” she said. The effort to import decision into her tone\nand manner was apparent. “That is what I desire you to understand. We\nmust not talk any more about me. I am not the topic of conversation.”\n\n“But first let me finish what I wanted to say,” he insisted. “My talk\nwon't break any bones. You'd be wrong not to listen to it--because\nit's meant to help you--to be of use to you. This is the thing, Lady\nCressage: You're in a particularly hard and unpleasant position. Like my\nfriend Plowden”--he watched her face narrowly but in vain, in the dull\nlight, for any change at mention of the name--“like my friend Plowden\nyou have a position and title to keep up, and next to nothing to keep\nit up on. But he can go down into the City and make money--or try to. He\ncan accept Directorships and tips about the market and so on, from men\nwho are disposed to be good to him, and who see how he can be of use to\nthem--and in that way he can do something for himself. But there is the\ndifference: you can't do these things, or you think you can't, which\nis the same thing. You're all fenced in; you're surrounded by\nnotice-boards, telling you that you mustn't walk this way or look that\nway; that you mustn't say this thing or do the other. Now your\nfriend down ahead there--Miss Madden--she doesn't take much stock\nin notice-boards. In fact, she feeds the gulls, simply because she's\nforbidden to do it. But you--you don't feed any gulls, and yet you're\nannoyed with yourself that you don't. Isn't that the case? Haven't I\nread you right?”\n\nShe seemed to have submitted to his choice of a topic. There was no\ntouch of expostulation in the voice with which she answered him. “I see\nwhat you think you mean,” she said.\n\n“Think!” he responded, with self-confident emphasis. “I'm not\n'thinking.' I'm reading an open book. As I say, you're not\ncontented--you're not happy; you don't try to pretend that you are.\nBut all the same, though you hate it, you accept it. You think that you\nreally must obey your notice-boards. Now what I tell you you ought to do\nis to take a different view. Why should you put up all this barbed\nwire between yourself and your friends? It doesn't do anybody else any\ngood--and it does you harm. Why, for example, should Plowden be free to\ntake things from me, and you not?”\n\nShe glanced at him, with a cold half-smile in her eye. “Unfortunately I\nwas not asked to join your Board.”\n\nHe pressed his lips tightly together, and regarded her meditatively as\nhe turned these words over in his mind. “What I'm doing for Plowden,”\n he said with slow vagueness meanwhile, “it isn't so much because he's on\nthe Board. He's of no special use to me there. But he was nice to me at\na time when that meant everything in the world to me--and I don't forget\nthings of that sort. Besides, I like him--and it pleases me to let him\nin for a share of my good fortune. See? It's my way of enjoying myself.\nWell now, I like you too, and why shouldn't I be allowed to let you in\nalso for a share of that good fortune? You think there's a difference,\nbut I tell you it's imaginary--pure moonshine. Why, the very people\nwhose opinion you're afraid of--what did they do themselves when the\nSouth African craze was on? I'm told that the scum of the earth had\nonly to own some Chartered shares, and pretend to be 'in the know' about\nthem--and they could dine with as many duchesses as they liked. I knew\none or two of the men who were in that deal--I wouldn't have them in my\nhouse--but it seems there wasn't any other house they couldn't go to in\nLondon.”\n\n“Oh yes, there were many houses,” she interposed. “It wasn't a nice\nexhibition that society made of itself--one admits that,--but it was\nonly one set that quite lost their heads. There are all kinds of sets,\nyou know. And--I don't think I see your application, in any event. The\ncraze, as you call it, was all on a business basis. People ran after\nthose who could tell them which shares were going up, and they gambled\nin those shares. That was all, wasn't it?”\n\nStill looking intently at her, he dismissed her query with a little\nshake of the head. “'On a business basis,'” he repeated, as if talking\nto himself. “They like to have things 'on a business basis.'”\n\nHe halted, with a hand held out over her arm, and she paused as well,\nin a reluctant, tentative way. “I don't understand you,” she remarked,\nblankly.\n\n“Let me put it in this way,” he began, knitting his brows, and\nmarshalling the thoughts and phrases with which his mind had been busy.\n“This is the question. You were saying that you weren't asked to join my\nBoard. You explained in that way how I could do things for Plowden,\nand couldn't do them for you. Oh, I know it was a joke--but it had its\nmeaning--at least to me. Now I want to ask you--if I decide to form\nanother Company, a very small and particular Company--if I should decide\nto form it, I say--could I come to you and ask you to join THAT Board?\nOf course I could ask--but what I mean is--well, I guess you know what I\nmean.”\n\nThe metaphor had seemed to him a most ingenious and satisfactory vehicle\nfor his purpose, and it had broken down under him amid evidences of\nconfusion which he could not account for. All at once his sense of\nphysical ascendancy had melted away--disappeared. He looked at Lady\nCressage for an instant, and knew there was something shuffling and\nnerveless in the way his glance then shifted to the dim mountain chain\nbeyond. His heart fluttered surprisingly inside his breast, during the\nsilence which ensued.\n\n“Surely you must have said everything now that you wished to say,” she\nobserved at last. She had been studying intently the trodden snow at her\nfeet, and did not even now look up. The constraint of her manner, and a\ncertain pleading hesitation in her words, began at once to restore his\nself-command. “Do not talk of it any further, I beg of you,” she went\non. “We--we have been lagging behind unconscionably. If you wish to\nplease me, let us hurry forward now. And please!--no more talk at all!”\n\n“But just a word--you're not angry?”\n\nShe shook her head very slightly.\n\n“And you do know that I'm your friend--your solid, twenty-four-carat\nfriend?”\n\nAfter a moment's pause, she made answer, almost in a whisper--“Yes--be\nmy friend--if it amuses you,”--and led the way with precipitate steps\ndown the winding road.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nTWO days later, Thorpe and his young people took an early morning train\nfor Geneva--homeward bound.\n\nIt was entirely easy to accept their uncle's declaration that urgent\nbusiness summoned him to London, yet Julia and Alfred, when they chanced\nto exchange glances after the announcement, read in each other's eyes\nthe formless impression that there were other things beside business.\nTheir uncle, they realized, must be concerned in large and probably\nventuresome enterprises; but it did not fit with their conception of his\ncharacter that commercial anxieties should possess the power to upset\nhim. And upset he undeniably was.\n\nThey traced his disturbance, in a general way, to the morning following\nthe excursion up to Glion and Caux. He told them then that he had slept\nvery badly, and that they must “count him out” of their plans for the\nday. He continued to be counted out of what remained of their stay\nat Territet. He professed not to be ill, but he was restless and\npreoccupied. He ate little, but smoked continuously, and drank spirits\na good deal, which they had not seen him do before. Nothing would induce\nhim to go out either day.\n\nStrangely enough, this disturbance of their uncle's equanimity\nsynchronized with an apparent change in the attitude of their new\nfriends on the floor below. This change was, indeed, more apparent\nthan definable. The ladies were, to the nicest scrutiny, as kindly and\naffable as ever, but the sense of comradeship had somehow vanished.\nInsensibly, the two parties had ceased to have impulses and tastes in\ncommon. There were no more trips together--no more fortuitous luncheons\nor formal dinners as a group.\n\nThe young people looked up at the front of the big hotel on this\nmorning of departure, after they had clambered over the drifts into the\nsnow-bedecked train, and opened the window of their compartment. They\nmade sure that they could identify the windows of Miss Madden's suite,\nand that the curtains were drawn aside--but there was no other token\nof occupancy discernible. They had said good-bye to the two ladies the\nprevious evening, of course--it lingered in their minds as a rather\nperfunctory ceremony--but this had not prevented their hoping for\nanother farewell glimpse of their friends. No one came to wave a hand\nfrom the balcony, however, and the youngsters looked somewhat dubiously\nat each other as the train moved. Then intuitively they glanced toward\ntheir uncle--and perceived that he had his hat pulled over his eyes, and\nwas staring with a kind of moody scowl at the lake opposite.\n\n“Fortunately, it is a clear day,” said Julia. “We shall see Mont Blanc.”\n\nHer voice seemed to have a hollow and unnatural sound in her own ears.\nNeither her uncle nor her brother answered her.\n\n\nAt breakfast, meanwhile, in the apartment toward which the young people\nhad turned their farewell gaze in vain, Miss Madden sipped her coffee\nthoughtfully while she read a letter spread upon the table beside her.\n\n“It's as they said,” she observed. “You are not allowed to drive in the\nmountains with your own horses and carriage. That seems rather quaint\nfor a model Republic--doesn't it?”\n\n“I daresay they're quite right,” Lady Cressage replied, listlessly.\n“It's in the interest of safety. People who do not know the mountains\nwould simply go and get killed in avalanches and hurricanes--and all\nthat. I suppose that is what the Government wishes to prevent.”\n\n“And you're on the side of the Government,” said the other, with a\ntwinkle in her brown eyes. “Truly now--you hated the whole idea of\ndriving over the Simplon.”\n\nLady Cressage lifted her brows in whimsical assent as she nodded.\n\n“But do you like this Russian plan any better?” demanded Celia. “I wish\nfor once you would be absolutely candid and open with me--and let me\nknow to the uttermost just what you think.” “'For once'?” queried the\nother. Her tone was placid enough, but she allowed the significance of\nthe quotation to be marked.\n\n“Oh, I never wholly know what you're thinking,” Miss Madden declared.\nShe put on a smile to alleviate the force of her remarks. “It is not\nyou alone--Edith. Don't think that! But it is ingrained in your\ncountry-women. You can't help it. It's in your blood to keep things\nback. I've met numbers of English ladies who, I'm ready to believe,\nwould be incapable of telling an untruth. But I've never met one of whom\nI could be sure that she would tell me the whole truth. Don't you see\nthis case in point,” she pursued, with a little laugh, “I could not drag\nit out of you that you disliked the Simplon idea, so long as there was\na chance of our going. Immediately we find that we can't go, you admit\nthat you hated it.”\n\n“But you wanted to go,” objected Lady Cressage, quietly. “That was the\nimportant thing. What I wanted or did not want had nothing to do with\nthe matter.”\n\nCelia's face clouded momentarily. “Those are not the kind of things I\nlike to hear you say,” she exclaimed, with a certain vigour. “They put\neverything in quite a false light. I am every whit as anxious that you\nshould be pleased as that I should. You know that well enough. I've said\nit a thousand times--and have I ever done anything to disprove it? But\nI never can find out what you do want--what really will please you! You\nnever will propose anything; you never will be entirely frank about the\nthings I propose. It's only by watching you out of the corner of my eye\nthat I can ever guess whether anything is altogether to your liking or\nnot.”\n\nThe discussion seemed to be following lines familiar to them both. “That\nis only another way of saying what you discovered long ago,” said\nLady Cressage, passively--“that I am deficient in the enthusiasms. But\noriginally you were of the opinion that you had enthusiasms enough for\ntwo, and that my lack of them would redress the balance, so to speak.\nI thought it was a very logical opinion then, and, from my own point of\nview, I think so now. But if it does not work in practice, at least the\nresponsibility of defending it is not mine.”\n\n“Delightful!” cried Celia, smiling gayly as she put down her cup again.\n“You are the only woman I've ever known who was worth arguing with.\nThe mere operation makes me feel as if I were going through Oxford--or\npassing the final Jesuit examinations. Heaven knows, I would get up\narguments with you every day, for the pure enjoyment of the thing--if\nI weren't eternally afraid of saying something that would hurt your\nfeelings, and then you wouldn't tell me, but would nurse the wound in\nsilence in the dark, and I should know that something was wrong, and\nhave to watch you for weeks to make out what it was--and it would all\nbe too unhappy. But it comes back, you see, to what I said before. You\ndon't tell me things!”\n\nEdith smiled in turn, affectionately enough, but with a wistful reserve.\n“It is a constitutional defect--even national, according to you. How\nshall I hope to change, at this late day? But what is it you want me to\ntell you?--I forget.”\n\n“The Russian thing. To go to Vienna, where we get our passports, and\nthen to Cracow, and through to Kief, which they say is awfully well\nworth while--and next Moscow--and so on to St. Petersburg, in time\nto see the ice break up. It is only in winter that you see the\ncharacteristic Russia: that one has always heard. With the furs and the\nsledges, and the three horses galloping over the snow--it seems to me it\nmust be the best thing in Europe--if you can call Russia Europe.\nThat's the way it presents itself to me--but then I was brought up in\na half-Arctic climate, and I love that sort of thing--in its proper\nseason. It is different with you. In England you don't know what a real\nwinter is. And so I have to make quite sure that you think you would\nlike the Russian experiment.”\n\nThe other laughed gently. “But if I don't know what a real winter is,\nhow can I tell whether I will like it or not? All I do know is that I am\nperfectly willing to go and find out. Oh yes--truly--I should like very\nmuch to go.”\n\nMiss Madden sighed briefly. “All right,” she said, but with a notable\nabsence of conviction in her tone.\n\nA space of silence ensued, as she opened and glanced through another\nnote, the envelope of which had borne no postmark. She pouted her lips\nover the contents of this missive, and raised her eyebrows in token of\nsurprise, but as she laid it down she looked with a frank smile at her\ncompanion.\n\n“It's from our young friend,” she explained, genially--“the\npainter-boy--Mr. D'Aubigny. It is to remind me of a promise he says I\nmade--that when I came to London he should paint my portrait. I don't\nthink I promised anything of the kind--but I suppose that is a detail.\nIt's all my unfortunate hair. They must have gone by this time--they\nwere to go very early, weren't they?”\n\nLady Cressage glanced at the clock. “It was 8:40, I think--fully half an\nhour ago,” she answered, with a painstaking effect of indifference.\n\n“Curious conglomeration”--mused the other. “The boy and girl are so\ncivilized, and their uncle is so rudimentary. I'm afraid they are\nspoiling him just as the missionaries spoil the noble savage. They\nought to go away and leave him alone. As a barbarian he was rather\neffective--but they will whitewash him and gild him and make a tame\nmonstrosity of him. But I suppose it's inevitable. Having made his\nfortune, it is the rule that he must set up as a gentleman. We do it\nmore simply in America. One generation makes the fortune, and leaves\nit to the next generation to put on the frills. My father, for example,\nnever altered in the slightest degree the habits he formed when he was a\npoor workman. To the day of his death, blessed old man, he remained what\nhe had always been--simple, pious, modest, hard-working, kindly, and\nthrifty--a model peasant. Nothing ever tempted him a hair's-breadth out\nof the path he had been bred to walk in. But such nobility of mind and\ntemper with it all! He never dreamed of suggesting that I should walk\nin the same path. From my earliest childhood I cannot remember his ever\nputting a limitation upon me that wasn't entirely sensible and generous.\nI must have been an extremely trying daughter, but he never said so;\nhe never looked or acted as if he thought so.--But I never stop when I\nbegin talking of my father.”\n\n“It's always very sweet to me to hear you talk of him,” Lady Cressage\nput in. “One knows so few people who feel that way about their fathers!”\n\nCelia nodded gravely, as if in benevolent comment upon something that\nhad been left unsaid. The sight of the young artist's note recalled her\nearlier subject. “Of course there is a certain difference,” she went\non, carelessly,--“this Mr. Thorpe is not at all a peasant, as the phrase\ngoes. He strikes one, sometimes, as having been educated.”\n\n“Oh, he was at a public school, Lord Plowden tells me,” said the other,\nwith interest. “And his people were booksellers--somewhere in London--so\nthat he got a good smattering of literature and all that. He certainly\nhas more right to set up as a gentleman than nine out of ten of the\nnouveaux riches one sees flaunting about nowadays. And he can talk very\nwell indeed--in a direct, practical sort of way. I don't quite follow\nyou about his niece and nephew spoiling him. Of course one can see that\nthey have had a great effect upon him. He sees it himself--and he's very\nproud of it. He told me so, quite frankly. But why shouldn't it be a\nnice effect?”\n\n“Oh, I don't know,” Celia replied, idly. “It seemed to me that he was\nthe kind of piratical buccaneer who oughtn't to be shaved and polished\nand taught drawing-room tricks--I feel that merely in the interest\nof the fitness of things. Have you looked into his eyes--I mean when\nthey've got that lack-lustre expression? You can see a hundred thousand\ndead men in them.”\n\n“I know the look you mean,” said Lady Cressage, in a low voice.\n\n“Not that I assume he is going to kill anybody,” pursued Miss Madden,\nwith ostensible indifference, but fixing a glance of aroused attention\nupon her companion's face, “or that he has any criminal intentions\nwhatever. He behaves very civilly indeed, and apparently his niece and\nnephew idolize him. He seems to be the soul of kindness to them. It may\nbe that I'm altogether wrong about him--only I know I had the instinct\nof alarm when I caught that sort of dull glaze in his eye. I met an\nAfrican explorer a year ago, or so, about whose expeditions dark stories\nwere told, and he had precisely that kind of eye. Perhaps it was this\nthat put it into my head--but I have a feeling that this Thorpe is an\nexceptional sort of man, who would have the capacity in him for terrible\nthings, if the necessity arose for them.”\n\n“I see what you mean,” the other repeated. She toyed with the\nbread-crumbs about her plate, and reflectively watched their\nmanipulation into squares and triangles as she went on. “But may that\nnot be merely the visible sign of an exceptionally strong and masterful\ncharacter? And isn't it, after all, the result of circumstances whether\nsuch a character makes, as you put it, a hundred thousand dead men, or\nenriches a hundred thousand lives instead? We agree, let us say, that\nthis Mr. Thorpe impresses us both as a powerful sort of personality. The\nquestion arises, How will he use his power? On that point, we look\nfor evidence. You see a dull glaze in his eye, and you draw hostile\nconclusions from it. I reply that it may mean no more than that he is\nsleepy. But, on the other hand, I bring proofs that are actively in\nhis favour. He is, as you say, idolized by the only two members of his\nfamily that we have seen--persons, moreover, who have been brought up\nin ways different to his own, and who would not start, therefore, with\nprejudices in his favour. Beyond that, I know of two cases in which\nhe has behaved, or rather undertaken to behave, with really lavish\ngenerosity--and in neither case was there any claim upon him of a\nsubstantial nature. He seems to me, in fact, quite too much disposed\nto share his fortune with Tom, Dick, and Harry--anybody who excites\nhis sympathy or gets into his affections.” Having said this much, Lady\nCressage swept the crumbs aside and looked up. “So now,” she added, with\na flushed smile, “since you love arguments so much, how do you answer\nthat?”\n\nCelia smiled back. “Oh, I don't answer it at all,” she said, and her\nvoice carried a kind of quizzical implication. “Your proofs overwhelm\nme. I know nothing of him--and you know so much!”\n\nLady Cressage regarded her companion with a novel earnestness and\ndirectness of gaze. “I had a long, long talk with him--the afternoon we\ncame down from Glion.”\n\nMiss Madden rose, and going to the mantel lighted a cigarette. She\ndid not return to the table, but after a brief pause came and took an\neasy-chair beside her friend, who turned to face her. “My dear Edith,”\n she said, with gravity, “I think you want to tell me about that\ntalk--and so I beg you to do so. But if I'm mistaken--why then I beg you\nto do nothing of the kind.”\n\nThe other threw out her hands with a gesture of wearied impatience, and\nthen clasped them upon her knee. “I seem not to know what I want! What\nis the good of talking about it? What is the good of anything?”\n\n“Now--now!” Celia's assumption of a monitor's tone had reference,\napparently, to something understood between the two, for Lady Cressage\ndeferred to it, and even summoned the ghost of a smile.\n\n“There is really nothing to tell,”--she faltered, hesitatingly--“that\nis, nothing happened. I don't know how to say it--the talk left my mind\nin a whirl. I couldn't tell you why. It was no particular thing that was\nsaid--it seemed to be more the things that I thought of while something\nelse was being talked about--but the whole experience made a most\ntremendous impression upon me. I've tried to straighten it out in my own\nmind, but I can make nothing of it. That is what disturbs me, Celia. No\nman has ever confused me in this silly fashion before. Nothing could be\nmore idiotic. I'm supposed to hold my own in conversation with people\nof--well, with people of a certain intellectual rank,--but this man, who\nis of hardly any intellectual rank at all, and who rambled on without\nany special aim that one could see--he reduced my brain to a sort of\nporridge. I said the most extraordinary things to him--babbling rubbish\nwhich a school-girl would be ashamed of. How is that to be accounted\nfor? I try to reason it out, but I can't. Can you?”\n\n“Nerves,” said Miss Madden, judicially.\n\n“Oh, that is meaningless,” the other declared. “Anybody can say\n'nerves.' Of course, all human thought and action is 'nerves.'”\n\n“But yours is a special case of nerves,” Celia pursued, with gentle\nimperturbability. “I think I can make my meaning clear to you--though\nthe parallel isn't precisely an elegant one. The finest thoroughbred\ndog in the world, if it is beaten viciously and cowed in its youth, will\nalways have a latent taint of nervousness, apprehension, timidity--call\nit what you like. Well, it seems to me there's something like that in\nyour case, Edith. They hurt you too cruelly, poor girl. I won't say\nit broke your nerve--but it made a flaw in it. Just as a soldier's old\nwound aches when there's a storm in the air--so your old hurt distracts\nand upsets you under certain psychological conditions. It's a rather\nclumsy explanation, but I think it does explain.”\n\n“Perhaps--I don't know,” Edith replied, in a tone of melancholy reverie.\n“It makes a very poor creature out of me, whatever it is.”\n\n“I rather lose patience, Edith,” her companion admonished her, gravely.\n“Nobody has a right to be so deficient in courage as you allow yourself\nto be.”\n\n“But I'm not a coward,” the other protested. “I could be as brave as\nanybody--as brave as you are--if a chance were given me. But of what use\nis bravery against a wall twenty feet high? I can't get over it. I only\nwound and cripple myself by trying to tear it down, or break through\nit.--Oh yes, I know what you say! You say there is no wall--that it is\nall an illusion of mine. But unfortunately I'm unable to take that view.\nI've battered myself against it too long--too sorely, Celia!”\n\nCelia shrugged her shoulders in comment. “Oh, we women all have our\nwalls--our limitations--if it comes to that,” she said, with a kind\nof compassionate impatience in her tone. “We are all ridiculous\ntogether--from the point of view of human liberty. The free woman is a\nfraud--a myth. She is as empty an abstraction as the 'Liberty, Equality,\nFraternity' that the French put on their public buildings. I used to\nhave the most wonderful visions of what independence would mean. I\nthought that when I was absolutely my own master, with my money and my\ncourage and my free mind, I would do things to astonish all mankind. But\nreally the most I achieve is the occasional mild surprise of a\nGerman waiter. Even that palls on one after a time. And if you were\nindependent, Edith--if you had any amount of money--what difference do\nyou think it would make to you? What could you do that you don't do, or\ncouldn't do, now?”\n\n“Ah, now”--said the other, looking up with a thin smile--“now is an\ninterval--an oasis.”\n\nMiss Madden's large, handsome, clear-hued face, habitually serene in its\nexpression, lost something in composure as she regarded her companion.\n“I don't know why you should say that,” she observed, gently enough, but\nwith an effect of reproof in her tone. “I have never put limits to the\nconnection, in my own mind--and it hadn't occurred to me that you were\ndoing so in yours.”\n\n“But I'm not,” interposed Lady Cressage.\n\n“Then I understand you less than ever. Why do you talk about an\n'interval'? What was the other word?--'oasis'--as if this were a brief\nhalt for refreshments and a breathing-spell, and that presently you must\nwander forth into the desert again. That suggestion is none of mine. We\nagreed that we would live together--'pool our issues,' as they say in\nAmerica. I wanted a companion; so did you. I have never for an instant\nregretted the arrangement. Some of my own shortcomings in the matter I\nhave regretted. You were the most beautiful young woman I had ever seen,\nand you were talented, and you seemed to like me--and I promised myself\nthat I would add cheerfulness and a gay spirit to your other gifts--and\nin that I have failed wofully. You're not happy. I see that only too\nclearly.”\n\n“I know--I'm a weariness and a bore to you,” broke in the other,\ndespondingly.\n\n“That is precisely what you're not,” Celia went on. “We mustn't use\nwords of that sort. They don't describe anything in our life at all. But\nI should be better pleased with myself if I could really put my finger\non what it is that is worrying you. Even if we decided to break up our\nestablishment, I have told you that you should not go back to what you\nregard as poverty. Upon that score, I had hoped that your mind was easy.\nAs I say, I think you attach more importance to money than those who\nhave tested its powers would agree to--but that's neither here nor\nthere. You did not get on well on 600 pounds a year--and that is enough.\nYou shall never have less than twice that amount, whether we keep\ntogether or not--and if it ought to be three times the amount, that\ndoesn't matter.\n\n“You don't seem to realize, Edith”--she spoke with increased\nanimation--“that you are my caprice. You are the possession that I am\nproudest of and fondest of. There is nothing else that appeals to me a\nhundredth part as much as you do. Since I became independent, the one\nreal satisfaction I have had is in being able to do things for you--to\nhave you with me, and make you share in the best that the world can\noffer. And if with it all you remain unhappy, why then you see I don't\nknow what to do.”\n\n“Oh, I know--I behave very badly!” Lady Cressage had risen, and with\nvisible agitation began now to pace the room. “I deserve to be thrown\ninto the lake--I know it well enough! But Celia--truly--I'm as incapable\nof understanding it as you are. It must be that I am possessed by\ndevils--like the people in the New Testament. Perhaps someone will come\nalong who can cast them out. I don't seem able to do it myself. I can't\nrule myself at all. It needs a strength I haven't got!”\n\n“Ah!” said Celia, thoughtfully. The excited sentences which Edith threw\nover her shoulder as she walked appeared, upon examination, to contain a\nsuggestion.\n\n“My dear child,” she asked abruptly, after a moment's silence, “do you\nwant to marry?”\n\nLady Cressage paused at the mantel, and exchanged a long steadfast\nglance with her friend. Then she came slowly forward. “Ah, that is what\nI don't know,” she answered. Apparently the reply was candid.\n\nMiss Madden pursed her lips, and frowned a little in thought. Then, at\nsome passing reflection, she smiled in a puzzled fashion. At last she\nalso rose, and went to the mantel for another cigarette. “Now I am\ngoing to talk plainly,” she said, with decision. “Since the subject is\nmentioned, less harm will be done by speaking out than by keeping still.\nThere is a debate in your mind on the matter, isn't there?”\n\nThe other lady, tall, slender, gently ruminative once more, stood at the\nwindow and with bowed head looked down at the lake. “Yes--I suppose it\nmight be called that,” she replied, in a low voice.\n\n“And you hesitate to tell me about it? You would rather not?” Celia,\nafter an instant's pause, went on without waiting for an answer. “I beg\nthat you won't assume my hostility to the idea, Edith. In fact, I'm not\nsure I don't think it would be the best thing for you to do. Marriage,\na home, children--these are great things to a woman. We can say that she\npays the price of bondage for them--but to know what that signifies, we\nmust ask what her freedom has been worth to her.”\n\n“Yes,” interposed the other, from the window. “What have I done with my\nfreedom that has been worth while?”\n\n“Not much,” murmured Celia, under her breath. She moved forward, and\nstood beside Edith, with an arm round her waist. They looked together at\nthe lake.\n\n“It is Lord Plowden, is it not?” asked the American, as the silence grew\nconstrained.\n\nLady Cressage looked up alertly, and then hesitated over her reply.\n“No,” she said at last. Upon reflection, and with a dim smile flickering\nin her side-long glance at Celia, she added, “He wants to marry you, you\nknow.”\n\n“Leave that out of consideration,” said Celia, composedly. “He has never\nsaid so. I think it was more his mother's idea than his, if it existed\nat all. Of course I am not marrying him, or anybody else. But I saw at\nHadlow that you and he were--what shall I say?--old friends.”\n\n“He must marry money,” the other replied. In an unexpected burst of\ncandour she went on: “He would have asked me to marry him if I had\nhad money. There is no harm in telling you that. It was quite\nunderstood--oh, two years ago. And I think I wished I had the\nmoney--then.”\n\n“And you don't wish it now?”\n\nA slight shake of Edith's small, shapely head served for answer. After\na little, she spoke in a musing tone: “He is going to have money of his\nown, very soon, but I don't think it would attract me now. I like him\npersonally, of course, but--there is no career, no ambition, no future.”\n\n“A Viscount has future enough behind him,” observed Celia.\n\n“It doesn't attract me,” the other repeated, vaguely. “He is handsome,\nand clever, and kind and all that--but he would never appeal to any of\nthe great emotions--nor be capable of them himself He is too smooth, too\nwell-balanced, too much the gentleman. That expresses it badly--but do\nyou see what I mean?”\n\nCelia turned, and studied the beautiful profile beside her, in a steady,\ncomprehending look.\n\n“Yes, I think I see what you mean,” she said, with significance in her\ntone.\n\nLady Cressage flushed, and released herself from her companion's arm.\n“But I don't know myself what I mean!” she exclaimed, despairingly, as\nshe moved away. “I don't know!--I don't know!”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nON the last day of February, Mrs. Dabney was surprised if not\nexhilarated by a visit from her two children in the little book-shop.\n\n“It's the last day in the world that I should have thought you'd 'a'\ncome out on,” she told them, in salutation--and for comment they all\nglanced along the dark narrow alley of shelves to the street window. A\ngloomy spectacle it was indeed, with a cold rain slanting through the\ndiscredited remnants of a fog, which the east wind had broken up, but\ncould not drive away, and with only now and again a passer-by moving\nacross the dim vista, masked beneath an umbrella, or bent forward with\nchin buried in turned-up collar. In the doorway outside the sulky boy\nstamped his feet and slapped his sides with his arms in pantomimic\nmutiny against the task of guarding the book-stalls' dripping covers,\nwhich nobody would be mad enough to pause over, much less to lift.\n\n“I don't know but I'd ought to let the boy bring in the books and go\nhome,” she said, as their vague gaze was attracted by his gestures. “But\nit isn't three yet--it seems ridiculous to close up. Still, if you'd be\nmore comfortable upstairs--”\n\n“Why, mamma! The idea of making strangers of us,” protested Julia.\nShe strove to make her tone cheerful, but its effect of rebuke was\nunmistakable.\n\nThe mother, leaning against the tall desk, looked blankly at her\ndaughter. The pallid flicker of the gas-jet overhead made her long,\nlistless face seem more devoid of colour than ever.\n\n“But you are as good as strangers, aren't you?” she observed, coldly.\n“You've been back in town ten days and more, and I've scarcely laid eyes\nupon either of you. But don't you want to sit down? You can put those\nparcels on the floor anywhere. Or shall I do it for you?”\n\nAlfred had been lounging in the shadowed corner against a heap of old\nmagazines tied in bundles. He sprang up now and cleared the chair, but\nhis sister declined it with a gesture. Her small figure had straightened\nitself into a kind of haughty rigidity.\n\n“There has been so much to do, mamma,” she explained, in a clear, cool\nvoice. “We have had hundreds of things to buy and to arrange about. All\nthe responsibility for the housekeeping rests upon me--and Alfred\nhas his studio to do. But of course we should have looked in upon you\nsooner--and much oftener--if we had thought you wanted us. But really,\nwhen we came to you, the very day after our return, it was impossible\nfor us to pretend that you were glad to see us.”\n\n“Oh, I was glad enough,” Mrs. Dabney made answer, mechanically. “Why\nshouldn't I be glad? And why should you think I wasn't glad? Did you\nexpect me to shout and dance?”\n\n“But you said you wouldn't come to see us in Ovington Square,” Alfred\nreminded her.\n\n“That's different,” she declared. “What would I be doing in Ovington\nSquare? It's all right for you to be there. I hope you'll be happy\nthere. But it wouldn't add anything to your happiness to have me there;\nit would be quite the other way about. I know that, if you DON'T. This\nis my place, here, and I intend to stick to it!”\n\nJulia's bright eyes, scanning the apathetic, stubborn maternal\ncountenance, hardened beyond their wont. “You talk as if there had been\nsome class war declared,” she said, with obvious annoyance. “You know\nthat Uncle Stormont would like nothing better than to be as nice to you\nas he is to us.”\n\n“Uncle Stormont!” Mrs. Dabney's repetition of the words was surcharged\nwith hostile sarcasm. “But his name was Stormont as much as it was Joel,”\n broke in Alfred, from his dark corner. “He has a perfect right to use\nthe one he likes best.”\n\n“Oh, I don't dispute his right,” she replied, once more in her\npassionless monotone. “Everybody can call themselves whatever they\nplease. It's no affair of mine. You and your sister spell your father's\nname in a way to suit yourselves: I never interfered, did I? You have\nyour own ideas and your own tastes. They are quite beyond me--but\nthey're all right for you. I don't criticize them at all. What I say is\nthat it is a great mercy your uncle came along, with his pockets full\nof money to enable you to make the most of them. If I were religious I\nshould call that providential.”\n\n“And that's what we DO call it,” put in Julia, with vivacity. “And why\nshould you shut your doors against this Providence, mamma? Just think of\nit! We don't insist upon your coming to live at Ovington Square at all.\nProbably, as you say, you would be happier by yourself--at least for\nthe present. But when Uncle St--when uncle says there's more than enough\nmoney for us all, and is only too anxious for you to let him do things\nfor you--why, he's your own brother! It's as if I should refuse to allow\nAlfred to do things for me.”\n\n“That you never did,” interposed the young man, gayly. “I'll say that\nfor you, Jule.”\n\n“And never will,” she assured him, with cheerful decision. “But\nno--mamma--can't you see what we mean? We have done what you wanted us\nto do. You sent us both to much better schools than you could afford,\nfrom the time we were of no age at all--and when uncle's money came you\nsent us to Cheltenham. We did you no discredit. We worked very well; we\nbehaved ourselves properly. We came back to you at last with fair reason\nto suppose that you would be--I won't say proud, but at least well\nsatisfied with us--and then it turned out that you didn't like us at\nall.”\n\n“I never said anything of the sort,” the mother declared, with a touch\nof animation.\n\n“Oh no--you never said it,” Julia admitted, “but what else can we think\nyou mean? Our uncle sends for us to go abroad with him, and you busy\nyourself getting me ready, and having new frocks made and all that--and\nI never hear a suggestion that you don't want me to go----”\n\n“But I did want you to go,” Mrs. Dabney affirmed.\n\n“Well, then, when I come back--when we come back, and tell you what\nsplendid and generous plans uncle has made for us, and how he has taken\na beautiful furnished house and made it our home, and so on,--why, you\nwon't even come and look at the house!”\n\n“But I don't want to see it,” the mother retorted; obstinately.\n\n“Well, then, you needn't!” said Alfred, rising. “Nobody will ask you\nagain.” “Oh yes they will,” urged Julia, glancing meaningly from one\nto the other. All her life, as it seemed, she had been accustomed to\nmediate between these two unpliable and stubborn temperaments. From her\nearliest childhood she had understood, somehow, that there was a Dabney\nhabit of mind, which was by comparison soft and if not yielding, then\npolitic: and set over against it there was a Thorpe temper full of\ngnarled and twisted hardnesses, and tenacious as death. In the days\nof her grandfather Thorpe, whom she remembered with an alarmed\ndistinctness, there had existed a kind of tacit idea that his name alone\naccounted for and justified the most persistent and stormy bad temper.\nThat old man with the scowling brows bullied everybody, suspected\neverybody, apparently disliked everybody, vehemently demanded his own\nwill of everybody--and it was all to be explained, seemingly, by the\nfact that he was a Thorpe.\n\nAfter his disappearance from the scene--unlamented, to the best of\nJulia's juvenile perceptions--there had been relatively peaceful times\nin the book-shop and the home overhead, yet there had existed always a\nrecognized line of demarcation running through the household. Julia and\nher father--a small, hollow-chested, round-shouldered young man, with a\npale, anxious face and ingratiating manner, who had entered the shop as\nan assistant, and remained as a son-in-law, and was now the thinnest of\nunsubstantial memories--Julia and this father had stood upon one side\nof this impalpable line as Dabneys, otherwise as meek and tractable\npersons, who would not expect to have their own way.\n\nAlfred and his mother were Thorpes--that is to say, people who\nnecessarily had their own way. Their domination was stained by none\nof the excesses which had rendered the grandfather intolerable. Their\nsurface temper was in truth almost sluggishly pacific. Underneath,\nhowever, ugly currents and sharp rocks were well known to have a\npotential existence--and it was the mission of the Dabneys to see that\nno wind of provocation unduly stirred these depths. Worse even than\nthese possibilities of violence, however, so far as every-day life was\nconcerned, was the strain of obstinacy which belonged to the Thorpe\ntemper. A sort of passive mulishness it was, impervious to argument,\nimmovable under the most sympathetic pressure, which particularly tried\nthe Dabney patience. It seemed to Julia now, as she interposed her\nsoothing influence between these jarring forces, that she had spent\nwhole years of her life in personal interventions of this sort.\n\n“Oh yes they will,” she repeated, and warned her brother into the\nbackground with a gesture half-pleading half-peremptory. “We are your\nchildren, and we're not bad or undutiful children at all, and I'm sure\nthat when you think it all over, mamma, you'll see that it would be\nabsurd to let anything come between you and us.”\n\n“How could I help letting it come?” demanded the mother, listlessly\nargumentative. “You had outgrown me and my ways altogether. It was\nnonsense to suppose that you would have been satisfied to come back and\nlive here again, over the shop. I couldn't think for the life of me what\nI was going to do with you. But now your uncle has taken all that into\nhis own hands. He can give you the kind of home that goes with your\neducation and your ideas--and what more do you want? Why should you come\nbothering me?”\n\n“How unjust you are, mamma!” cried Julia, with a glaze of tears upon her\nbright glance.\n\nThe widow took her elbow from the desk, and, slowly straightening\nherself, looked down upon her daughter. Her long plain face, habitually\ngrave in expression, conveyed no hint of exceptional emotion, but the\nfingers of the large, capable hands she clasped before her writhed\nrestlessly against one another, and there was a husky-threat of collapse\nin her voice as she spoke:\n\n“If you ever have children of your own,” she said, “and you slave your\nlife out to bring them up so that they'll think themselves your\nbetters, and they act accordingly--then you'll understand. But you don't\nunderstand now--and there's no good our talking any more about it. Come\nin whenever it's convenient--and you feel like it. I must go back to my\nbooks now.”\n\nShe took up a pen at this, and opened the cash-book upon the blotter.\nHer children, surveying her blankly, found speech difficult. With some\nmurmured words, after a little pause, they bestowed a perfunctory kiss\nupon her unresponsive cheek, and filed out into the rain.\n\nMrs. Dabney watched them put up their umbrella, and move off Strandward\nbeneath it. She continued to look for a long time, in an aimless,\nruminating way, at the dismal prospect revealed by the window and the\nglass of the door. The premature night was closing in miserably, with\nincreasing rain, and a doleful whistle of rising wind round the corner.\nAt last she shut up the unconsidered cash-book, lighted another gas-jet,\nand striding to the door, rapped sharply on the glass.\n\n“Bring everything in!” she called to the boy, and helped out his\napprehension by a comprehensive gesture.\n\nLater, when he had completed his task, and one of the two narrow outlets\nfrom the shop in front was satisfactorily blocked with the wares from\nwithout, and all the floor about reeked with the grimy drippings of the\noilskins, Mrs. Dabney summoned him to the desk in the rear.\n\n“I think you may go home now,” she said to him, with the laconic\nabruptness to which he was so well accustomed. “You have a home, haven't\nyou?”\n\nRemembering the exhaustive enquiries which the Mission people had made\nabout him and his belongings, as a preliminary to his getting this job,\nhe could not but be surprised at the mistress's question. In confusion\nhe nodded assent, and jerked his finger toward his cap.\n\n“Got a mother?” she pursued. Again he nodded, with augmented confidence.\n\n“And do you think yourself better than she is?”\n\nThe urchin's dirty and unpleasant face screwed itself up in anxious\nperplexity over this strange query. Then it cleared as he thought he\ngrasped the idea, and the rat-eyes he lifted to her gleamed with the\nfell acuteness of the Dials. “I sh'd be sorry if I wasn't,” he answered,\nin swift, rasping accents. “She's a rare old boozer, she is! It's a\nfair curse to an honest boy like me, to 'ave--” “Go home!” she bade him,\nperemptorily--and frowned after him as he ducked and scuttled from the\nshop.\n\nLeft to herself, Mrs. Dabney did not reopen the cash-book--the wretched\nday, indeed, had been practically a blank in its history--but loitered\nabout in the waning light among the shelves near the desk, altering the\nposition of books here and there, and glancing cursorily through others.\nOnce or twice she went to the door and looked out upon the rain-soaked\nstreet. A tradesman's assistant, opposite, was rolling the iron shutters\ndown for the night. If business in hats was over for the day, how much\nmore so in books! Her shop had never been fitted with shutters--for what\nreason she could not guess. The opened pages of numerous volumes were\ndisplayed close against the window, but no one had ever broken a pane\nto get at them. Apparently literature raised no desires in the criminal\nbreast. To close the shop there was nothing to do but lock and bolt the\ndoor and turn out the lights. At last, as the conviction of nightfall\nforced itself upon her from the drenched darkness outside, she bent\nto put her hand to the key. Then, with a little start of surprise,\nshe stood erect. Someone was shutting an umbrella in the doorway,\npreparatory to entering the shop.\n\nIt was her brother, splashed and wet to the knees, but with a glowing\nface, who pushed his way in, and confronted her with a broad grin. There\nwas such a masterful air about him, that when he jovially threw an arm\nround her gaunt waist, and gathered her up against his moist shoulder,\nshe surprised herself by a half-laughing submission.\n\nHer vocabulary was not rich in phrases for this kind of emergency. “Do\nmind what you're about!” she told him, flushing not unpleasurably.\n\n“Shut up the place!” he answered, with lordly geniality. “I've walked\nall the way from the City in the rain. I wanted the exertion--I couldn't\nhave sat in a cab. Come back and build up the fire, and let's have a\ntalk. God! What things I've got to tell you!”\n\n“There isn't any fire down here,” she said, apologetically, as they\nedged their way through the restricted alley to the rear. “The old\nfireplace took up too much room. Sometimes, in very sharp weather, I\nhave an oil-stove in. Usually the gas warms it enough. You don't find\nit too cold--do you?--with your coat on? Or would you rather come\nupstairs?”\n\n“Never mind the cold,” he replied, throwing a leg over the stool before\nthe desk. “I can't stay more 'n a minute or two. What do you think we've\ndone today?”\n\nLouisa had never in her life seen her brother look so well as he did\nnow, sprawling triumphantly upon the stool under the yellow gas-light.\nHis strong, heavily-featured face had somehow ceased to be commonplace.\nIt had acquired an individual distinction of its own. He looked up at\nher with a clear, bold eye, in which, despite its gloss of good-humour,\nshe discerned a new authority.\n\nThe nervous and apprehensive lines had somehow vanished from the\ncountenance, and with them, oddly enough, that lethargic, heavy\nexpression which had been their complement. He was all vigour,\nreadiness, confidence, now. She deemed him almost handsome, this\ncurious, changeable brother of hers, as he beat with his fist in a\nmeasured way upon the desk-top to emphasize his words, and fastened his\ncommanding gaze upon her.\n\n“We took very nearly twenty thousand pounds to-day,” he went on. “This\nis the twenty-eighth of February. A fortnight ago today was the first\nsettlement. I wasn't here, but Semple was--and the working of it is all\nin his hands. He kept as still as a mouse that first day. They had to\ndeliver to us 26,000 shares, and they hadn't got one, but we didn't make\nany fuss. The point was, you see, not to let them dream that they were\ncaught in a trap. We didn't even put the price up to par. They had to\ncome to Semple, and say there didn't seem to be any shares obtainable\njust at the moment, and what would he carry them over at? That means,\nto let them postpone delivery for another fortnight. He was as smooth\nas sweet-oil with them, and agreed to carry them over till today without\nany charge at all. But today it was a little different. The price was up\nten shillings above par. That is to say, Semple arranged with a jobber,\non the quiet, d'ye see? to offer thirty shillings for our one-pound\nshares. That offer fixed the making-up price. So then, when they were\nstill without shares to-day, and had to be carried over again, they had\nto pay ten shillings' difference on each of twenty-six thousand shares,\nplus the difference between par and the prices they'd sold at. That\nmakes within a few hundreds of 20,000 pounds in cash, for one day's\nhaul. D'ye see?”\n\nShe nodded at him, expressively. Through previous talks she had really\nobtained an insight into the operation, and it interested her more than\nshe would have cared to confess.\n\n“Well, then, we put that 20,000 pounds in our pockets,” he proceeded\nwith a steady glow in his eyes. “A fortnight hence, that is March 14th,\nwe ring the bell on them again, and they march up to the captain's\noffice and settle a second time. Now what happens on the 14th? A jobber\nmakes the price for Semple again, and that settles the new sum they have\nto pay us in differences. It is for us to say what that price shall be.\nWe'll decide on that when the time comes. We most probably will just put\nit up another ten shillings, and so take in just a simple 13,000 pounds.\nIt's best in the long run, I suppose, to go slow, with small rises like\nthat, in order not to frighten anybody. So Semple says, at any rate.”\n\n“But why not frighten them?” Louisa asked. “I thought you wanted to\nfrighten them. You were full of that idea a while ago.”\n\nHe smiled genially. “I've learned some new wrinkles since then. We'll\nfrighten 'em stiff enough, before we're through with them. But at the\nstart we just go easy. If they got word that there was a 'corner,' there\nwould be a dead scare among the jobbers. They'd be afraid to sell or\nname a price for Rubber Consols unless they had the shares in hand. And\nthere are other ways in which that would be a nuisance. Presently, of\ncourse, we shall liberate some few shares, so that there may be some\nactual dealings. Probably a certain number of the 5,000 which went to\nthe general public will come into the market too. But of course you see\nthat all such shares will simply go through one operation before they\ncome back to us. Some one of the fourteen men we are squeezing will\nsnap them up and bring them straight to Semple, to get free from the\nfortnightly tax we are levying on them. In that way we shall eventually\nlet out say half of these fourteen 'shorts,' or perhaps more than half.”\n\n“What do you want to do that for?” The sister's grey eyes had caught a\nmetallic gleam, as if from the talk about gold. “Why let anybody out?\nWhy can't you go on taking their money for ever?”\n\nThorpe nodded complacently. “Yes--that's what I asked too. It seemed to\nme the most natural thing, when you'd got 'em in the vise, to keep them\nthere. But when you come to reflect--you can't get more out of a man\nthan there is in him. If you press him too hard, he can always go\nbankrupt--and then he's out of your reach altogether, and you lose\neverything that you counted on making out of him. So, after a certain\npoint, each one of the fourteen men whom we're squeezing must be dealt\nwith on a different footing. We shall have to watch them all, and study\ntheir resources, as tipsters watch horses in the paddock.\n\n“You see, some of them can stand a loss of a hundred thousand pounds\nbetter than others could lose ten thousand. All that we have to know. We\ncan take it as a principle that none of them will go bankrupt and lose\nhis place on the exchange unless he is pressed tight to the wall. Well,\nour business is to learn how far each fellow is from the wall to start\nwith. Then we keep track of him, one turn of the screw after another,\ntill we see he's got just enough left to buy himself out. Then we'll let\nhim out. See?”\n\n“It's cruel, isn't it?” she commented, calmly meditative, after a little\npause.\n\n“Everything in the City is cruel,” he assured her with a light tone.\n“All speculative business is cruel. Take our case, for example. I\nestimate in a rough way that these fourteen men will have to pay over\nto us, in differences and in final sales, say seven hundred thousand\npounds--maybe eight hundred. Well, now, not one of those fellows ever\nearned a single sovereign of that money. They've taken the whole of\nit from others, and these others took it from others still, and so on\nalmost indefinitely. There isn't a sovereign of it that hasn't been\nthrough twenty hands, or fifty for that matter, since the last man who\nhad done some honest work for it parted company with it. Well--money\nlike that belongs to those who are in possession of it, only so long\nas they are strong enough to hold on to it. When someone stronger still\ncomes along, he takes it away from them. They don't complain: they don't\ncry and say it's cruel. They know it's the rule of the game. They accept\nit--and begin at once looking out for a new set of fools and weaklings\nto recoup themselves on. That's the way the City goes.”\n\nThorpe had concluded his philosophical remarks with ruminative slowness.\nAs he lapsed into silence now, he fell to studying his own hands on\nthe desk-top before him. He stretched out the fingers, curved them\nin different degrees, then closed them tight and turned the bulky\nhard-looking fists round for inspection in varying aspects.\n\n“That's the kind of hand,” he began again, thoughtfully, “that breaks\nthe Jew in the long run, if there's only grit enough behind it. I used\nto watch those Jews' hands, a year ago, when I was dining and wining\nthem. They're all thin and wiry and full of veins. Their fingers\nare never still; they twist round and keep stirring like a lobster's\nfeelers. But there aint any real strength in 'em. They get hold of most\nof the things that are going, because they're eternally on the move.\nIt's their hellish industry and activity that gives them such a pull,\nand makes most people afraid of them. But when a hand like that takes\nthem by the throat”--he held up his right hand as he spoke, with the\nthick uncouth fingers and massive thumb arched menacingly in a powerful\nmuscular tension--“when THAT tightens round their neck, and they feel\nthat the grip means business--my God! what good are they?”\n\nHe laughed contemptuously, and slapped the relaxed palm on the desk with\na noise which made his sister start. Apparently the diversion recalled\nsomething to her mind.\n\n“There was a man in here asking about you today,” she remarked, in a\ncasual fashion. “Said he was an old friend of yours.”\n\n“Oh, yes, everybody's my 'old friend' now,” he observed with beaming\nindifference. “I'm already getting heaps of invitations to dinners and\ndances and all that. One fellow insisted on booking me for Easter\nfor some salmon fishing he's got way down in Cumberland. I told him I\ncouldn't come, but he put my name down all the same. Says his wife will\nwrite to remind me. Damn his wife! Semple tells me that when our squeeze\nreally begins and they realize the desperate kind of trap they're in,\nthey'll simply shower attentions of that sort on me. He says the\nsocial pressure they can command, for a game of this kind, is something\ntremendous. But I'm not to be taken in by it for a single pennyworth,\nd'ye see? I dine with nobody! I fish and shoot and go yachting with\nnobody! Julia and Alfred and our own home in Ovington Square--that'll\nbe good enough for me. By the way--you haven't been out to see us yet.\nWe're all settled now. You must come at once--why not with me, now?”\n\nLouisa paid no heed to this suggestion. She had been rummaging among\nsome loose papers on the top of the desk, and she stepped round now to\nlift the lid and search about for something inside.\n\n“He left a card for you,” she said, as she groped among the desk's\ncontents. “I don't know what I did with it. He wrote something on it.”\n\n“Oh, damn him, and his card too,” Thorpe protested easily. “I don't want\nto see either of them.”\n\n“He said he knew you in Mexico. He said you'd had dealings together. He\nseemed to act as if you'd want to see him--but I didn't know. I didn't\ntell him your address.”\n\nThorpe had listened to these apathetic sentences without much interest,\nbut the sum of their message appeared suddenly to catch his attention.\nHe sat upright, and after a moment's frowning brown study, looked\nsharply up at his sister.\n\n“What was his name?” he asked with abruptness.\n\n“I don't in the least remember,” she made answer, holding the desk-top\nup, but temporarily suspending her search. “He was a little man,\nfive-and-fifty, I should think. He had long grey hair--a kind of\nQuaker-looking man. He said he saw the name over the door, and he\nremembered your telling him your people were booksellers. He only got\nback here in England yesterday or the day before. He said he didn't know\nwhat you'd been doing since you left Mexico. He didn't even know whether\nyou were in England or not!”\n\nThorpe had been looking with abstracted intentness at a set of\ngreen-bound cheap British poets just at one side of his sister's head.\n“You must find that card!” he told her now, with a vague severity in\nhis voice. “I know the name well enough, but I want to see what he's\nwritten. Was it his address, do you remember? The name itself was\nTavender, wasn't it? Good God! Why is it a woman never knows where\nshe's put anything? Even Julia spends hours looking for button-hooks or\ncorkscrews or something of that sort, every day of her life! They've\ngot nothing in the world to do except know where things are, right under\ntheir nose, and yet that's just what they don't know at all!”\n\n“Oh, I have a good few other things to do,” she reminded him, as she\nfumbled again inside the obscurity of the desk. “I can put my hand on\nany one of four thousand books in stock,” she mildly boasted over her\nshoulder, “and that's something you never learned to do. And I can tell\nif a single book is missing--and I wouldn't trust any shopman I ever\nknew to do that.”\n\n“Oh of course, you're an exception,” he admitted, under a sense of\njustice. “But I wish you'd find the card.”\n\n“I know where it is,” she suddenly announced, and forthwith closed the\ndesk. Moving off into the remoter recesses of the crowded interior, she\nreturned to the light with the bit of pasteboard in her hand. “I'd stuck\nit in the little mirror over the washstand,” she explained.\n\nHe almost snatched it from her, and stood up the better to examine it\nunder the gas-light. “Where is Montague Street?” he asked, with rough\ndirectness.\n\n“In Bloomsbury--alongside the Museum. That's one Montague Street--I\ndon't know how many others there may be.”\n\nThorpe had already taken up his umbrella and was buttoning his coat.\n“Yes--Bloomsbury,” he said hurriedly. “That would be his form. And you\nsay he knew nothing about my movements or whereabouts--nothing about the\nCompany, eh?” He looked at his watch as he spoke. Evidently the presence\nof this stranger had excited him a good deal.\n\n“No,” she assured him, reflectively; “no, I'm sure he didn't. From what\nhe said, he doesn't know his way about London very well, or anywhere\nelse, for that matter, I should say.”\n\nThorpe nodded, and put his finger to his forehead with a meaning look.\n“No--he's a shade off in the upper story,” he told her in a confidential\ntone. “Still, it's important that I should see him,”--and with only a\nhasty hand-shake he bustled out of the shop.\n\nBy the light of the street lamp opposite, she could see him on the\npavement, in the pelting rain, vehemently signalling with his umbrella\nfor a cab.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\n“We've got a spare room here, haven't we?” Thorpe asked his niece, when\nshe came out to greet him in the hall of their new home in Ovington\nSquare. He spoke with palpable eagerness before even unbuttoning his\ndamp great-coat, or putting off his hat. “I mean it's all in working\norder ready for use?”\n\n“Why yes, uncle,” Julia answered, after a moment's thought. “Is someone\ncoming?”\n\n“I think so,” he replied, with a grunt of relief. He seemed increasingly\npleased with the project he had in mind, as she helped him off with his\nthings. The smile he gave her, when she playfully took his arm to lead\nhim into the adjoining library, was clearly but a part of the satisfied\ngrin with which he was considering some development in his own affairs.\n\nHe got into his slippers and into the easy-chair before the bright fire\nand lit a cigar with a contented air.\n\n“Well, my little girl?” he said, with genial inconsequence, and smiled\nagain at her, where she stood beside the mantel.\n\n“It will be such a lark to play the hostess to a stranger!” she\nexclaimed. “When is he coming?--I suppose it is a 'he,'” she added, less\nbuoyantly.\n\n“Oh--that fellow,” Thorpe said, as if he had been thinking of something\nelse. “Well--I can't tell just when he will turn up. I only learned he\nwas in town--or in England--a couple of hours ago. I haven't seen him\nyet at all. I drove round to his lodgings, near the British Museum,\nbut he wasn't there. He only comes there to sleep, but they told me he\nturned in early--by nine o'clock or so. Then I went round to a hotel and\nwrote a note for him, and took it back to his lodgings, and left it for\nhim. I told him to pack up his things as soon as he got it, and drive\nhere, and make this his home--for the time being at least.”\n\n“Then it's some old friend of yours?” said the girl. “I know I shall\nlike him.”\n\nThorpe laughed somewhat uneasily. “Well--yes--he's a kind of a friend of\nmine,” he said, with a note of hesitation in his voice. “I don't know,\nthough, that you'll think much of him. He aint what you'd call a ladies'\nman.”\n\nHe laughed again at some thought the words conjured up. “He's a curious,\nsimple old party, who'd just like a comfortable corner somewhere by\nhimself, and wouldn't expect to be talked to or entertained at all.\nIf he does come, he'll keep to himself pretty well. He wouldn't be\nany company for you. I mean,--for you or Alfred either. I think he's\na Canadian or West Indian,--British subject, at all events,--but he's\nlived all his life in the West, and he wouldn't know what to do in\na drawing-room, or that sort of thing. You'd better just not pay any\nattention to him. Pass the time of day, of course, but that's all.”\n\nJulia's alert, small-featured face expressed some vague disappointment\nat what she heard, but her words were cheerful enough. “Oh of\ncourse--whatever he likes best,” she said. “I will tell Potter to make\neverything ready. I suppose there's no chance of his being here in time\nfor dinner?”\n\nThorpe shook his head, and then lifted his brows over some new\nperplexity. “I guess he'd want to eat his meals out, anyway,” he said,\nafter some thought. “I don't seem to remember much about him in\nthat respect--of course, everything was so different in camp out in\nMexico--but I daresay he wouldn't be much of an ornament at the table.\nHowever, that'll be all right. He's as easy to manage as a rabbit. If I\ntold him to eat on the roof, he'd do it without a murmur. You see it's\nthis way, Julia: he's a scientific man--a kind of geologist, and mining\nexpert and rubber expert--and chemical expert and all sort of things. I\nsuppose he must have gone through college--very likely he'll turn out to\nhave better manners than I was giving him credit for. I've only seen him\nin the rough, so to speak. We weren't at all intimate then,--but we had\ndealings together, and there are certain important reasons why I should\nkeep close in touch with him while he's here in London. But I'll try and\ndo that without letting you be bothered.” “What an idea!” cried Julia.\n“As if that wasn't what we had the house for--to see the people you want\nto see.”\n\nHer uncle smiled rather ruefully, and looked in a rather dubious way at\nhis cigar. “Between you and me and the lamp-post, Jule,” he said, with a\nslow, whimsical drawl, “there isn't a fellow in the world that I wanted\nto see less than I did him. But since he's here--why, we've got to make\nthe best of it.”\n\nAfter dinner, Thorpe suffered the youngsters to go up to the\ndrawing-room in the tacit understanding that he should probably not see\nthem again that night. He betook himself then once more to the library,\nas it was called--the little, cozy, dark-panelled room off the hall,\nwhere the owner of the house had left two locked bookcases, and where\nThorpe himself had installed a writing-desk and a diminutive safe for\nhis papers. The chief purpose of the small apartment, however, was\nindicated by the two big, round, low-seated easy-chairs before the\nhearth, and by the cigar boxes and spirit-stand and tumblers visible\nbehind the glass of the cabinet against the wall. Thorpe himself\ncalled the room his “snuggery,” and spent many hours there in slippered\ncomfort, smoking and gazing contentedly into the fire. Sometimes Julia\nread to him, as he sat thus at his ease, but then he almost invariably\nwent to sleep.\n\nNow, when he had poured out some whiskey and water and lit a cigar, the\nlounging chairs somehow did not attract him. He moved about aimlessly in\nthe circumscribed space, his hands in his pockets, his burly shoulders\nrounded, his face dulled and heavy as with a depression of doubt. The\nsound of the piano upstairs came intermittently to his ears. Often he\nascended to the drawing-room to hear Julia play--and more often still,\nwith all the doors open, he enjoyed the mellowed murmur of her music\nhere at his ease in the big chair. But tonight he had no joy in the\nnoise. More than once, as he slouched restlessly round the room, the\nnotion of asking her to stop suggested itself, but he forbore to put it\ninto action. Once he busied himself for a time in kneeling before his\nsafe, and scrutinizing in detail the papers in one of the bundles it\ncontained.\n\nAt last--it was after ten o'clock, and the music above had ceased--the\nwelcome sounds of cab-wheels without, and then of the door-bell, came to\ndispel his fidgeting suspense. On the instant he straightened himself,\nand his face rearranged its expression. He fastened upon the door of the\nroom the controlled, calm glance of one who is easily confident about\nwhat is to happen.\n\n“Quaker-looking” was not an inapt phrase for the person whom the maid\nushered into the room through this door. He was a small, thin, elderly\nman, bowed of figure and shuffling in gait. His coat and large,\nlow-crowned hat, though worn almost to shabbiness, conveyed an\nindefinable sense of some theological standard, or pretence to such\na standard. His meagre face, too, with its infinity of anxious yet\nmeaningless lines, and its dim spectacled eyes, so plainly overtaxed by\nthe effort to discern anything clearly, might have belonged to any old\nvillage priest grown childish and blear-eyed in the solitude of stupid\nbooks. Even the blotches of tell-tale colour on his long nose were not\naltogether unclerical in their suggestion. A poor old man he seemed,\nas he stood blinking in the electric light of the strange, warm\napartment--a helpless, worn old creature, inured through long years to\nbleak adverse winds, hoping now for nothing better in this world than\npresent shelter.\n\n“How do you do, Mr. Thorpe,” he said, after a moment, with nervous\nformality. “This is unexpectedly kind of you, sir.”\n\n“Why--not at all!” said Thorpe, shaking him cordially by the hand. “What\nhave we got houses for, but to put up our old friends? And how are you,\nanyway? You've brought your belongings, have you? That's right!” He\nglanced into the hall, to make sure that they were being taken upstairs,\nand then closed the door. “I suppose you've dined. Take off your hat and\ncoat! Make yourself at home. That's it--take the big chair, there--so!\nAnd now let's have a look at you. Well, Tavender, my man, you haven't\ngrown any younger. But I suppose none of us do. And what'll you have to\ndrink? I take plain water in mine, but there's soda if you prefer it.\nAnd which shall it be--Irish or Scotch?”\n\nMr. Tavender's countenance revealed the extremity of his surprise and\nconfusion at the warmth of this welcome. It apparently awed him as well,\nfor though he shrank into a corner of the huge chair, he painstakingly\nabstained from resting his head against its back. Uncovered, this head\ngained a certain dignity of effect from the fashion in which the\nthin, iron-grey hair, parted in the middle, fell away from the full,\nintellectual temples, and curled in meek locks upon his collar. A vague\nresemblance to the type of Wesley--or was it Froebel?--might have hinted\nitself to the observer's mind.\n\nThorpe's thoughts, however, were not upon types. “Well”--he said, from\nthe opposite chair, in his roundest, heartiest voice, when the other\nhad with diffidence suffered himself to be served, and had deferentially\nlighted on one side the big cigar pressed upon him--“Well--and how's the\nworld been using you?”\n\n“Not very handsomely, Mr. Thorpe,” the other responded, in a hushed,\nconstrained tone.\n\n“Oh, chuck the Misters!” Thorpe bade him. “Aren't we old pals, man?\nYou're plain Tavender, and I'm plain Thorpe.”\n\n“You're very kind,” murmured Tavender, still abashed. For some\nminutes he continued to reply dolefully, and with a kind of shamefaced\nreluctance, to the questions piled upon him. He was in evil luck:\nnothing had gone well with him; it had been with the greatest difficulty\nthat he had scraped together enough to get back to London on the chance\nof obtaining some expert commission; practically he possessed nothing\nin the world beyond the clothes on his back, and the contents of two old\ncarpet-bags--these admissions, by degrees, were wormed from him.\n\n“But have you parted with the concession, then, that you bought from\nme?” Thorpe suddenly asked him. “Help yourself to some more whiskey!”\n\nTavender sighed as he tipped the decanter. “It isn't any good,” he\nanswered, sadly. “The Government repudiates it--that is, the Central\nGovernment at Mexico. Of course, I never blamed you. I bought it with my\neyes open, and you sold it in perfect good faith. I never doubted that\nat all. But it's not worth the paper it's written on--that's certain.\nIt's that that busted me--that, and some other things.”\n\n“Well--well!” said Thorpe, blankly. His astonishment was obviously\ngenuine, and for a little it kept him silent, while he pondered the\nnovel aspects of the situation thus disclosed. Then his eyes brightened,\nas a new path outlined itself.\n\n“I suppose you've got the papers?--the concession and my transfer to you\nand all that?” he asked, casually.\n\n“Oh, yes,” replied Tavender. He added, with a gleam of returning\nself-command--“That's all I have got.”\n\n“Let's see--what was it you paid me?--Three thousand eight hundred\npounds, wasn't it?”\n\nTavender made a calculation in mental arithmetic. “Yes, something like\nthat. Just under nineteen thousand dollars,” he said.\n\n“Well,” remarked Thorpe, with slow emphasis, “I won't allow you to\nsuffer that way by me. I'll buy it back from you at the same price you\npaid for it.”\n\nTavender, beginning to tremble, jerked himself upright in his chair,\nand stared through his spectacles at his astounding host. “You say”--he\ngasped--“you say you'll buy it back!”\n\n“Certainly,” said Thorpe. “That's what I said.”\n\n“I--I never heard of such a thing!” the other faltered with increasing\nagitation. “No--you can't mean it. It isn't common sense!”\n\n“It's common decency,” replied the big man, in his most commanding\nmanner. “It's life and death to you--and it doesn't matter a flea-bite\nto me. So, since you came to grief through me, why shouldn't I do the\nfair thing, and put you back on your legs again?”\n\nTavender, staring now at those shrunken legs of his, breathed heavily.\nThe thing overwhelmed him. Once or twice he lifted his head and essayed\nto speak, but no speech came to his thin lips. He moistened them\neventually with a long deliberate pull at his glass.\n\n“This much ought to be understood, however,” Thorpe resumed, reflecting\nupon his words as he went along. “If I'm to buy back a dead horse, like\nthat, it's only reasonable that there should be conditions. I suppose\nyou've seen by this time that even if this concession of ours was\nrecognized by the Government there wouldn't be any money in it to speak\nof. I didn't realize that two years ago, any more than you did, but it's\nplain enough now. The trade has proved it. A property of rubber trees\nhas no real value--so long as there's a wilderness of rubber trees all\nround that's everybody's property. How can a man pay even the interest\non his purchase money, supposing he's bought a rubber plantation, when\nhe has to compete with people who've paid no purchase money at all, but\njust get out as much as they like from the free forest? You must know\nthat that is so.”\n\nTavender nodded eloquently. “Oh yes, I know that is so. You can prove it\nby me.”\n\nThorpe grinned a little. “As it happens, that aint what I need to have\nyou prove,” he said, dryly. “Now WE know that a rubber property is no\ngood--but London doesn't know it. Everybody here thinks that it's a\ngreat business to own rubber trees. Why, man alive, do you know”--the\naudacity of the example it had occurred to him to cite brought a\ngratified twinkle to his eyes as he went on--“do you know that a man\nhere last year actually sold a rubber plantation for four hundred\nthousand pounds--two millions of dollars! Not in cash, of course, but\nin shares that he could do something with--and before he's done with\nit, I'm told, he's going to make twice that amount of money out of it.\nThat'll show you what London is like.”\n\n“Yes--I suppose they do those things,” remarked Tavender, vaguely.\n\n“Well--my point is that perhaps I can do something or other with this\nconcession of yours here. I may even be able to get my money back on it.\nAt any rate I'll take my chances on it--so that at least you shan't lose\nanything by it. Of course, if you'd rather try and put it on the market\nyourself, why go ahead!” There was a wistful pathos in the way Tavender\nshook his head. “Big money doesn't mean anything to me any more,” he\nsaid, wearily. “I'm too old and I'm too tired. Why--four--five--yes,\nhalf a dozen times I've had enough money to last me comfortably all my\nlife--and every time I've used it as bait to catch bigger money with,\nand lost it all. I don't do that any more! I've got something the matter\nwith me internally that takes the nerve all out of me. The doctors don't\nagree about it, but whatever its name is I've got it for keeps. Probably\nI shan't live very long”--Thorpe recalled that the old man had always\ntaken a gloomy view of his health after the third glass--“and if you\nwant to pay me the nineteen thousand dollars, or whatever it is, why I\nshall say 'God bless you,' and be more than contented.”\n\n“Oh, there's something more to it than that,” observed Thorpe, with an\nadded element of business-like briskness in his tone. “If I let you out\nin this way--something, of course, you could never have dreamed would\nhappen--you must do some things for me. I should want you, for example,\nto go back to Mexico at once. Of course, I'd pay your expenses out. Or\nsay, I'd give you a round four thousand pounds to cover that and some\nother things too. You wouldn't object to that, would you?”\n\nThe man who, two hours before, had confronted existence with the change\nof his last five-pound note in his pocket, did not hesitate now. “Oh\nno, that would be all right,” with reviving animation, he declared. He\nhelped himself again from the cut-glass decanter. “What would you want\nme to do there?”\n\n“Oh, a report on the concession for a starter,” Thorpe answered,\nwith careful indifference. “I suppose they still know your name as an\nauthority. I could make that all right anyway. But one thing I ought\nto speak of--it might be rather important--I wouldn't like to have you\nmention to anybody that the concession has at any time been yours. That\nmight tend to weaken the value of your report, don't you see? Let it be\nsupposed that the concession has been my property from the start. You\ncatch my point, don't you? There never was any such thing as a transfer\nof it to you. It's always been mine!”\n\nTavender gave his benefactor a purblind sort of wink. “Always belonged\nto you? Why of course it did,” he said cheerfully.\n\nThe other breathed a cautious prolonged sigh of relief “You'd better\nlight a fresh one, hadn't you?” he asked, observing with a kind of\ncontemptuous tolerance the old man's efforts to ignite a cigar which had\nmore than once unrolled like a carpenter's shaving in his unaccustomed\nfingers, and was now shapelessly defiant of both draught and suction.\nTavender laughed to himself silently as he took a new cigar, and\npuffed at the match held by his companion. The air of innocence and\nlong-suffering meekness was falling rapidly away from him. He put his\nshabby boots out confidently to the fender and made gestures with his\nglass as he talked.\n\n“My mistake,” he declared, in insistent tones, “was in not turning down\nscience thirty years ago and going in bodily for business. Then I should\nhave made my pile as you seem to have done. But I tried to do something\nof both. Half the year I was assaying crushings, or running a level, or\nanalyzing sugars, for a salary, and the other half I was trying to do a\ngamble with that salary on the strength of what I'd learned. You can't\nring the bell that way. You've got to be either a pig or a pup. You\ncan't do both. Now, for instance, if I'd come to London when you did,\nand brought my money with me instead of buying your concession with\nit----”\n\n“Why, what good do you suppose you would have done?” Thorpe interrupted\nhim with good-natured brusqueness. “You'd have had it taken from you\nin a fortnight! Why, man, do you know what London is? You'd have had no\nmore chance here than a naked nigger in a swamp-full of alligators.”\n\n“You seem to have hit it off,” the other objected. “This is as fine a\nhouse as I was ever in.”\n\n“With me it's different,” Thorpe replied, carelessly. “I have the talent\nfor money-making. I'm a man in armour. The 'gators can't bite me, nor\nyet the rattle-snakes.”\n\n“Yes--men are made up differently,” Tavender assented, with\nphilosophical gravity. Then he lurched gently in the over-large chair,\nand fixed an intent gaze upon his host. “What did you make your money\nin?” he demanded, not with entire distinctness of enunciation. “It\nwasn't rubber, was it?”\n\nThorpe shook his head. “There's no money in rubber. I'm entirely in\nfinance--on the Stock Exchange--dealing in differences,” he replied,\nwith a serious face.\n\nThe explanation seemed wholly acceptable to Tavender. He mused upon it\nplacidly for a time, with his reverend head pillowed askew against the\ncorner of the chair. Then he let his cigar drop, and closed his eyes.\n\nThe master of the house bent forward, and noiselessly helped himself to\nanother glass of whiskey and water. Then, sinking back again, he eyed\nhis odd guest meditatively as he sipped the drink. He said to himself\nthat in all the miraculous run of luck which the year had brought him,\nthis was the most extraordinary manifestation of the lot. It had been\nso easy to ignore the existence of this tiresome and fatuous old man, so\nlong as he was in remote Mexico, that he had practically forgotten him.\nBut he should not soon forget the frightened shock with which he had\nlearned of his presence in London, that afternoon. For a minute or two,\nthere in his sister's book-shop, it had seemed as if he were falling\nthrough the air--as if the substantial earth had crumbled away from\nunder him. But then his nerve had returned to him, his resourceful brain\nhad reasserted itself. With ready shrewdness he had gone out, and met\nthe emergency, and made it the servant of his own purposes.\n\nHe could be glad now, unreservedly glad, that Tavender had come to\nLondon, that things had turned out as they had. In truth, he stood now\nfor the first time on solid ground. When he thought of it, now, the risk\nhe had been running all these months gave him a little sinking of the\nheart. Upon reflection, the performance of having sold the same property\nfirst to Tavender in Mexico and then to the Rubber Consols Company in\nLondon might be subject to injurious comment, or worse. The fact that it\nwas not a real property to begin with had no place in his thoughts.\nIt was a concession--and concessions were immemorially worth what they\nwould fetch. But the other thing might have been so awkward--and now it\nwas all right!\n\nFor an hour and more, till the fire burnt itself out and the guest's\nsnoring became too active a nuisance, Thorpe sat lost in this\ncongratulatory reverie. Then he rose, and sharply shaking Tavender into\na semblance of consciousness, led him upstairs and put him to bed.\n\nThree days later he personally saw Tavender off at Waterloo station by\nthe steamer-train, en route for Southampton and New York. The old man\nwas in childlike good spirits, looking more ecclesiastical than ever\nin the new clothes he had been enabled to buy. He visibly purred with\ncontent whenever his dim eyes caught sight of the new valise and steamer\ntrunk, which belonged to him, on the busy platform.\n\n“You've been very kind to me, Thorpe,” he said more than once, as they\nstood together beside the open door of the compartment. “I was never\nso hospitably treated before in my life. Your attention to me has been\nwonderful. I call you a true friend.”\n\n“Oh, that's all right! Glad to do it,” replied the other, lightly. In\ntruth he had not let Tavender stray once out of his sight during those\nthree days. He had dragged him tirelessly about London, showing him the\nsights from South Kensington Museum to the Tower, shopping with him,\nresting in old taverns with him, breakfasting, lunching, aud dining\nwith him--in the indefatigable resolution that he should strike up\nno dangerous gossiping acquaintance with strangers. The task had been\ntiresome in the extreme--but it had been very well worth while.\n\n“One thing I'm rather sorry about,” Tavender remarked, in apologetic\nparenthesis--“I ought to have gone down and seen that brother-in-law of\nmine in Kent. He's been very good to me, and I'm not treating him very\nwell. I wrote to tell him I was coming--but since then I haven't had\na minute to myself. However, I can write to him and explain how it\nhappened. And probably I'll be over again sometime.”\n\n“Why, of course,” said Thorpe, absently. The allusion to the\nbrother-in-law in Kent had escaped his notice, so intent was he upon a\nnew congeries of projects taking vague shape in his mind.\n\n“Think of yourself as my man out there,” he said now, slowly, following\nthe clue of his thoughts. “There may be big things to do. Write to me as\noften as you can. Tell me everything that's going on. Money will be no\nobject to me--you can have as much as you like--if things turn up out\nthere that are worth taking up. But mind you say nothing about me--or\nany connection you've ever had with me. You'll get a letter from the\nSecretary of a Company and the Chairman asking for a report on a certain\nproperty, and naming a fee. You simply make a good report--on its\nmerits. You say nothing about anything else--about me, or the history of\nthe concession, or its validity, or anything. I mustn't be alluded to in\nany way. You quite understand that?”\n\n“Trust me!” said the old man, and wrung his benefactor's hand.\n\nIt was indeed with a trustful eye that Thorpe watched the train draw out\nof the station.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nTHE week following the August Bank Holiday is very rarely indeed a busy\nor anxious time in the City. In the ordinary course of things, it\nserves as the easy-going prelude--with but casual and inattentive visits\neastward, and with only the most careless glances through the financial\npapers--to the halcyon period of the real vacation. Men come to the City\nduring this week, it is true, but their thoughts are elsewhere--on the\nmoors, on the blue sea, on the glacier or the fiord, or the pleasant\nGerman pine forests.\n\nTo the great mass of City people; this August in question began in a\nnormal enough fashion. To one little group of operators, however, and to\nthe widening circle of brokers, bankers, and other men of affairs whose\ninterests were more or less involved with those of this group, it was a\nseason of keen perturbation. A combat of an extraordinary character was\ngoing on--a combat which threatened to develop into a massacre. Even\nto the operators who, unhappily for themselves, were principals in this\nfight, it was a struggle in the dark. They knew little about it, beyond\nthe grimly-patent fact that they were battling for their very lives.\nThe outer ring of their friends and supporters and dependents knew still\nless, though their rage and fears were perhaps greater. The “press”\n seemed to know nothing at all. This unnatural silence of the City's\nmouthpieces, usually so resoundingly clamorous upon the one side and the\nother when a duel is in progress, gave a sinister aspect to the thing.\nThe papers had been gagged and blindfolded for the occasion. This in\nitself was of baleful significance. It was not a duel which they had\nbeen bribed to ignore. It was an assassination.\n\nOutwardly there was nothing to see, save the unofficial, bald statement\nthat on August 1st, the latest of twelve fortnightly settlements in this\nstock, Rubber Consols had been bid for, and carried over, at 15 pounds\nfor one-pound shares. The information concerned the public at large not\nat all. Nobody knew of any friend or neighbour who was fortunate enough\nto possess some of these shares. Readers here and there, noting the\nfigures, must have said to themselves that certain lucky people were\ncoining money, but very little happened to be printed as to the identity\nof these people. Stray notes were beginning to appear in the personal\ncolumns of the afternoon papers about a “Rubber King” of the name of\nThorpe, but the modern exploitation of the world's four corners makes so\nmany “kings” that the name had not, as yet, familiarized itself to the\npopular eye.\n\nCity men, who hear more than they read, knew in a general way about this\n“Rubber King.” He was an outsider who had come in, and was obviously\nfilling his pockets; but it was a comforting rule that outsiders who did\nthis always got their pockets emptied for them again in the long run.\nThere seemed nothing about Thorpe to suggest that he would prove an\nexception to the rule. He was investing his winnings with great freedom,\nso the City understood, and his office was besieged daily by promoters\nand touts. They could clean out his strong-box faster than the profits\nof his Rubber corner could fill it. To know such a man, however, could\nnot but be useful, and they made furtive notes of his number in Austin\nFriars on their cuffs, after conversation had drifted from him to other\ntopics.\n\nAs to the Rubber corner itself, the Stock Exchange as a whole was\napathetic. When some of the sufferers ventured cautious hints about the\npossibility of official intervention on their behalf, they were laughed\nat by those who did not turn away in cold silence. Of the fourteen men\nwho had originally been caught in the net drawn tight by Thorpe and\nSemple, all the conspicuous ones belonged to the class of “wreckers,” a\nclass which does not endear itself to Capel Court.\n\nBoth Rostocker and Aronson, who, it was said, were worst hit, were men\nof great wealth, but they had systematically amassed these fortunes by\nstrangling in their cradles weak enterprises, and by undermining and\ntoppling over other enterprises which would not have been weak if they\nhad been given a legitimate chance to live. Their system was legal\nenough, in the eyes alike of the law and of the Stock Exchange rules.\nThey had an undoubted right to mark out their prey and pursue it, and\nbring it down, and feed to the bone upon it. But the exercise of this\nright did not make them beloved by the begetters and sponsors of their\nvictims. When word first went round, on the last day of February, that\na lamb had unexpectedly turned upon these two practised and confident\nwolves, and had torn an ear from each of them, and driven them pell-mell\ninto a “corner,” it was received on all sides with a gratified smile.\n\nLater, by fortnightly stages, the story grew at once more tragic and\nmore satisfactory. Not only Rostocker and Aronson, but a dozen others\nwere in the cul de sac guarded by this surprising and bloody-minded\nlamb. Most of the names were well-known as those of “wreckers.” In this\ncategory belonged Blaustein, Ganz, Rothfoere, Lewis, Ascher, and\nMendel, and if Harding, Carpenter, and Vesey could not be so confidently\nclassified, at least their misfortune excited no particular sympathy.\nTwo other names mentioned, those of Norfell and Pinney, were practically\nunknown.\n\nThere was some surprise, however, at the statement that the old and\nrespected and extremely conservative firm of Fromentin Bros. was\nentangled in the thing. Egyptian bonds, minor Levantine loans, discounts\nin the Arabian and Persian trades--these had been specialties of the\nFromentins for many years. Who could have expected to find them caught\namong the “shorts” in Mexican rubber? It was Mexico, wasn't it, that\nthese Rubber Consols purported to be connected with?\n\nThorpe's Company, upon its commercial merits, had not been considered\nat all by the gentlemen of the Stock Exchange, at the time of its\nflotation. Men vaguely and with difficulty recalled the fact of its\nprospectus, when the “corner” in its shares was first talked about.\nThey looked it up in their lists and files, later on, but its terms said\nnothing to them. Nobody discussed the value of the assets owned by this\nCompany, or the probability of its paying a dividend--even when the\nprice bid for its shares was making the most sensational upward leaps.\nHow Thorpe stood with his shareholders, or whether he had any genuine\nshareholders behind him at all, was seen by the keen eyes of Capel Court\nto be beside the question. Very likely it was a queer affair, if the\ntruth were known--but at least it had substance enough in it to be\ngiving the “wreckers” a lively time.\n\nBy the end of July it was understood that the fight was better worth\nwatching than anything that had been seen in a long time. The only\ntrouble was that there was so little to see. The papers said nothing.\nThe sufferers were the reverse of garrulous. The little red Scotchman,\nSemple, who was the visible avenging sword of the “corner,” was more\nimperturbably silent than anybody else. His fellow-members in the\n“House” watched him now, however, with a new respect. They discovered\nunsuspected elements of power in his thin, tight mouth, in the direct,\ncold glances of his brown-grey eyes, in the very way he carried his head\nand wore his hat. He came to be pointed out, and nodded about behind his\nback, more than anyone else in the “House,” and important men sought his\nacquaintance, with an awkward show of civility, who were notorious for\ntheir rude exclusiveness.\n\nIt might be, of course, that his “corner” would break under him at any\nfortnightly settlement, but already he had carried it much further than\nsuch things often went, and the planning of the coup had been beyond\ndoubt Napoleonic.\n\nHad this small sandy Scot planned it, or was he merely the weapon in\nThorpe's hand? Both views had their supporters on the Exchange, but\nafter the wrench of August 1st, when with an abrupt eighty-shilling\nrise the price of Rubber Consols stood at 15 pounds, and it was to\nbe computed that Semple had received on that single day nearly 75,000\npounds in differences and “backwardation,” a story was set afloat which\ngave Thorpe the undivided credit of the invention. It was related as\ncoming from his own lips that he had schemed it all out to be revenged\nupon a group of Jewish operators, against whom he had a grievance. In\nconfirmation of this tale, it was pointed out that, of the seven men\nstill held pinned in the fatal “corner,” six were Jews--and this did,\nupon first glance, look significant. But then it was objected, upon\nreflection, that Blaustein and Ascher had both been permitted to make\ntheir escape, and this hardly justified the theory of an implacable\nanti-Semitic vendetta. The objection seemed reasonable, but it was met\nin turn by the point that Blaustein and Ascher had been bled white,\nas Bismarck's phrase went, before they were released, whereas the five\nChristians had been liberated with relatively moderate fines. Upon the\nwhole, a certain odour of the Judenhetze clung thereafter about the\n“corner” in Rubber Consols.\n\nOn an afternoon of the following week, Mr. Stormont Thorpe was alone in\nthe Board Room of the offices in Austin Friars. He had risen from the\ngreat roller-topped desk over between the windows, and walked now with\na lethargic, tired step to and fro before the empty fireplace, yawning\nmore than once, and stretching out his arms in the supreme gesture of\nfatigue. After a dozen listless rounds, something occurred to him. He\nmoved with a certain directness of purpose to the cabinet in the corner,\nunlocked it, and poured out for himself a tumbler of brandy and soda.\nHe drank it without a pause, then turned again, and began pacing up and\ndown as before, his hands clasped behind him, his head bent in thought.\n\nThe intervening six months had effected visible changes in the outer\nman. One noted most readily that the face had grown fuller in its\nlower parts, and was far less browned than formerly. The large, heavy\ncountenance, with its square jaws masked now under increased flesh, its\nbeginnings of a double-chin, and its slightly flabby effect of pallor,\nwas no longer lacking in individual distinction. It was palpably the\nvisage of a dictator. The moustache had been cut down to military\nbrevity, and the line of mouth below it was eloquent of rough power. The\nsteady grey eyes, seemingly smaller yet more conspicuous than before,\nrevealed in their glance new elements of secretiveness, of strategy\nsupported by abundant and confident personal force.\n\nThe man himself seemed scarcely to have grown stouter. He held himself\nmore compactly, as it were; seemed more the master of all his physical\nexpressions. He was dressed like a magnate who was also a person of\ntaste. There was a flower in the lapel of his well-shaped frock-coat,\nand the rustle of his starched and spotless white waistcoat murmured\npleasantly of refined toilets.\n\n“The Marquis of Chaldon--and a gentleman, with him.”\n\nThe announcement, from a clerk who had noiselessly opened the door,\nimposed itself with decorum upon Thorpe's reverie.\n\n“Who is the gentleman with him?” Thorpe began austerely to ask, after\nan instant's hesitation. But this briefest of delays had brought the\ncallers into plain view behind the clerk, and with a slight gesture the\nmaster assented to their entrance.\n\nThis large apartment was no longer called the Board Room by anybody. By\ntacit processes, it had become Mr. Thorpe's room. Not even the titular\nChairman of the Company, the renowned and eminent Lord Chaldon,\nex-Ambassador and ex-Viceroy, entered this chamber now with any\nassumption of proprietorship in it. No hint of a recollection that there\nwere such things as the Company and the Board, or that he was nominally\nthe head of both, expressed itself in his Lordship's demeanour as he\nadvanced, his hand a little extended.\n\nThe noble Chairman was white of beard and hair, and extremely courteous\nof manner--a small, carefully-clad, gracious old gentleman, whose\nmild pink countenance had, with years of anxiety about ways and\nmeans, disposed itself in lines which produced a chronic expression of\nsolicitude. A nervous affection of the eyelids lent to this look, at\nintervals, a beseeching quality which embarrassed the beholder. All\nmen had liked him, and spoken well of him throughout his long and\nhard-worked career. Thorpe was very fond of him indeed, and put a\nrespectful cordiality into his grasp of the proffered hand. Then he\nlooked, with a certain thinly-veiled bluntness of enquiry, past the\nMarquis to his companion.\n\n“You were very kind to give me the appointment,” said Lord Chaldon, with\na little purring gloss of affability upon the earnestness of his tone.\n“I wish very much to introduce to you my friend, my old friend I may\nsay, Monsieur Alexandre Fromentin. We slept together under the same\ntent, in the Persian country beyond Bagdad--oh, it must have been quite\nforty years ago. We were youngsters looking to win our first spurs\nthen--I in my line, he in his. And often since we have renewed that old\nfriendship--at many different places--India, and Constantinople, and\nEgypt. I wish heartily to commend him to your--your kindness.”\n\nThorpe had perfunctorily shaken hands with the stranger--a tall,\nslender, sharp-faced, clean-shaven, narrow-shouldered man, who by these\naccounts of his years ought not to have such excessively black hair. He\nbowed in a foreign fashion, and uttered some words which Thorpe, though\nhe recognized them as English in intent, failed to follow. The voice\nwas that of an elderly man, and at a second glance there were plenty\nof proofs that he might have been older than the Marquis, out there in\nPersia, forty years ago. But Thorpe did not like old men who dyed their\nhair, and he offered his visitors chairs, drawn up from the table toward\nhis desk, with a certain reserve of manner. Seating himself in the\nrevolving chair at the desk itself, he put the tips of his fingers\ntogether, and looked this gentleman with the Continental name and\nexperience in the face.\n\n“Is there something you wish me to do?” he asked, passively facilitating\nthe opening of conversation.\n\n“Ah, my God! 'Something'!”--repeated the other, with a fluttering\ngesture of his hands over his thin, pointed knees--“everything, Mr.\nThorpe!”\n\n“That's a tolerably large order, isn't it?” Thorpe asked, calmly, moving\na slow, inscrutable glance from one to the other of his callers.\n\n“I could ask for nothing that would be a greater personal favour--and\nkindness”--Lord Chaldon interposed. His tone bore the stress of\nsincerity.\n\n“That means a great deal to me, as you know, my Lord,” replied Thorpe,\n“but I don't in the least understand--what is it that your friend\nwants?”\n\n“Only that I shall not be buried in a bankrupt's grave,” the suppliant\nanswered, with a kind of embittered eagerness of utterance. “That I\nshall not see disgraced the honoured name that my father and his father\nbequeathed to my care!”\n\nThorpe's large, composed countenance betrayed a certain perplexity.\n“There must be a mistake,” he observed. “I don't even know this name of\nyours. I never heard it before.”\n\nThe other's mobile face twisted itself in a grimace of incredulity. He\nhad a conspicuously wide mouth, and its trick of sidelong extension at\nthis moment was very unpleasant. “Ah, Herr Je! He never heard it,” he\nejaculated, turning nervously to the Marquis. “Would to the good God you\nnever had!” he told Thorpe, with suppressed excitement.\n\nLord Chaldon, his own voice shaken a little, interposed with an\nexplanation. “My friend is the head--the respected head--of the firm of\nFromentin Brothers. I think you have--have dealings with them.”\n\nThorpe, after a furtive instant of bewilderment, opened his mouth.\n“Oh! I see,” he said. “I know what you mean now. With the French\npronunciation, I didn't recognize the name. I've always heard it called\n'Fromen'-tin' here in London. Oh, yes, of course--Fromen'tin Brothers.”\n\nHis lips shut tight again at this. The listeners had caught no helpful\nclue from the tone of his words. They exchanged a glance, and then M.\nFromentin spoke.\n\n“Mr. Thorpe,” he began, slowly, with an obvious effort at\nself-repression. “It is a very simple story. Our house is an old one.\nMy father's grandfather organized the finance of the commissariat of\nGeneral Bonaparte in Egypt. He created the small beginnings of the\ncarpet and rug importation from Asia Minor. His son, and in turn his\nson, followed him. They became bankers as well as importers. They\nhelped very greatly to develop the trade of the Levant. They were not\navaricious men, or usurers. It is not in our blood. Your Chairman, Lord\nChaldon, who honours me so highly by calling me his friend--he will\nassure you that we have a good name in the East. Our banks have\nbefriended the people, and never oppressed or injured them. For that\nreason--I will say perhaps for that reason--we have never become a very\nrich house. It is possible to name bankers who have made large fortunes\nout of Egypt. It was different with us. Lord Chaldon will tell you\nthat of our own free will--my two brothers and I--of our own choice we\nconsented to lose a fifth of all our possessions, rather than coin into\ngold by force the tears and blood of the wretched fellaheen.”\n\n“Yes--I have never known a more honourable or humane action,” put in the\nMarquis, fervently.\n\n“And then my brothers die--Polydor, who lived mostly at Smyrna, and\nwhose estate was withdrawn from the business by his widow, and Augustin,\nwho lived here in London after 1870, and died--it is now six years ago.\nHe left a son, Robert, who is my nephew, and my partner. He is now of\nan age--perhaps thirty years. He was a small child when he came to\nLondon--he has become more English than the English themselves. His\nactivity and industry are very great; he forms plans of such magnitude\nand numbers that they would compel his grandfather to turn in his\ncoffin. I am in indifferent health. I live much at Homburg and Marienbad\nand at Cairo. Practically speaking, I have retired from business. There\nremain branches of our house--in several places--but the London house\nhas become the centre of all things--and Robert has become the London\nhouse. This I make plain to your mind, do I, Mr. Thorpe?”\n\nThe other, with his chin sunk within the collar of his white waistcoat,\nand scrutinizing the narrator with a steadfast though impassive glance,\nmade the faintest possible nod of assent.\n\n“I had great confidence in Robert,” the old man went on. His eyes were\ndimming with tears, and his voice quavered uncertainly. “His plans\nseemed wise, even if they risked more than formerly. The conditions of\nbusiness are wholly altered since my youth--and it was best, I thought,\nto make Robert free to act under these conditions, which he understood\nmuch better than I could pretend to do. Thus it was that when he said it\nwas necessary for Fromentin Brothers to belong to the Stock Exchange,\nI did not object. He was active and bold and clever, and he was in the\nthick of the fight. Therefore he should be the judge in all things. And\nthat is our ruin. In the time of the South African excitement, he won a\ngreat deal of money. Then he lost it all and more. Then gambling began,\nand his fortunes went now up, now down, but always, as his books show to\nme now--sinking a little on the average. He grew more adventurous--more\ncareless. He put many small counters upon different numbers on the\ntable. You know what I mean? And in an accursed moment, because other\ngamblers were doing the same, he sold two thousand of your shares,\nwithout having them in his hands. Voila! He wishes now to put a bullet\nthrough his brain. He proposes that as the fitting end of Fromentin\nFreres.”\n\nThorpe, his chin on his breast, continued to regard the melancholy\nfigure opposite with a moody eye. It seemed a long minute before he\nbroke the tense silence by a sigh of discomfort. “I do not discuss these\nthings with anybody,” he said then, coldly. “If I had known who you\nwere, I don't think you'd have got in.”\n\nThe Marquis of Chaldon intuitively straightened himself in his chair,\nand turned toward the speaker a glance of distressed surprise.\n\n“Or no--I beg your pardon,” Thorpe hastened to add, upon the instant\nhint of this look--“that doesn't convey my meaning. Of course, our\nChairman brings whom he pleases. His friends--as a matter of course--are\nour friends. What I should have said was that if this had been mentioned\nbeforehand to me, I should have explained that it wasn't possible to\ndiscuss that particular business.”\n\n“But--pardon me”--said Lord Chaldon, in a quiet, very gentle, yet\ninsistent voice, which seemed now to recall to its listeners the fact\nthat sovereigns and chancellors had in their day had attentive ears for\nits tones--“pardon me, but why should it not be possible?”\n\nThorpe frowned doubtfully, and shifted his position in his chair. “What\ncould I say, if it were discussed?” he made vague retort. “I'm merely\none of the Directors. You are our Chairman, but you see he hasn't found\nit of any use to discuss it with you. There are hard and fast rules\nabout these things. They run their natural course. You are not a\nbusiness man, my Lord----”\n\n“Oh, I think I may be called a 'business man,'” interposed the nobleman,\nsuavely. “They would tell you so in Calcutta, I think, and in Cairo too.\nWhen one considers it, I have transacted a great deal of business--on\nthe behalf of other people. And if you will permit me--I do not impute\nindirection, of course--but your remark seems to require a footnote. It\nis true that I am Chairman of the Board on which you are a Director--but\nit is not quite the whole truth. I as Chairman know absolutely nothing\nabout this matter. As I understand the situation, it is not in your\ncapacity as a Director that you know anything about it either. Yet----”\n\nHe paused, as if suddenly conscious of some impropriety in this\ndomestic frankness before a third party, and Thorpe pounced through his\nwell-mannered hesitation with the swiftness of a bird of prey.\n\n“Let me suggest,” he said roundly, lifting his head and poising a\nhand to hold attention, while he thought upon what it was he should\nsuggest--“this is what I would say. It seems rather irregular, doesn't\nit? to debate the matter in the presence of an outsider. You see it\nyourself. That is partly what I meant. Now I have met Mr. Fromentin,” he\ngave the name its English vowels with an obstinate emphasis, “and I have\nheard his statement. You have heard it too. If he wishes to lay more\nfacts before us, why, well and good. But then I would suggest that\nhe leave the matter in our hands, to discuss and look into between\nourselves. That seems to you the proper course, doesn't it, Lord\nChaldon?”\n\nThe French banker had been studying with strained acuteness the big\nlymphatic mask of the Director, with sundry sharp glances aside at the\nChairman. The nervous changes on his alert, meagre old face showed\nhow intently he followed every phase of their talk. A certain sardonic\nperception of evil in the air curled on his lip when he saw the Marquis\naccede with a bow and wave of the hand to Thorpe's proposition. Then he\nmade his bow in turn, and put the best face possible upon the matter.\n\n“Naturally I consult your convenience--and the proprieties,” he said,\nwith an effect of proud humility. “There are but a few other facts to\nsubmit. My nephew has already paid, in differences upon those accursed\ntwo thousand shares, a sum of nearly 30,000 pounds. I have the figures\nin my pocket--but they are fixed in my head as well. Twenty-eight\nthousand five hundred, those differences already amount to, not to speak\nof interest. At the last settlement, August 1st, the price per share was\n15 pounds. That would make 30,000 pounds more, if we bought now--or a\ntotal of practically 60,000 pounds. Eh bien! I beg for the privilege of\nbeing allowed to buy these shares now. It is an unpleasant confession\nto make, but the firm of Fromentin Freres will be made very poor by this\nloss of 60,000 pounds. It was not always so, but it is so now. My nephew\nRobert has brought it into that condition. You see my shame at this\nadmission. With all my own means, and with his sister's marriage\nportion, we can make up this sum of 30,000 pounds, and still enable\nthe firm to remain in existence. I have gone over the books very\npainstakingly, since I arrived in London. It can be kept afloat, and\nit can be brought back to safe and moderately profitable courses--if\nnothing worse happens. With another six weeks like the last, this\nwill not be at all possible. We shall have the cup of dishonour thrust\nbetween our teeth. That will be the end of everything.”\n\nM. Fromentin finished in tremulous, grave tones. After looking with\nblurred eyes for a moment into Thorpe's face, he bowed his head, and\nsoftly swayed the knees upon which his thin, dark hands maintained their\nclutch. Not even the revelation of hair quite white at the roots, unduly\nwidening the track of parting on the top of his dyed head, could rob\nthis movement of its mournful dignity.\n\nThorpe, after a moment's pause, took a pencil and paper from the desk,\nand made a calculation. He bit his lips and frowned at the sight of\nthese figures, and set down some others, which seemed to please him no\nmore. Then, with a sudden gesture as of impatience, he rose to his feet.\n\n“How much is that sister's marriage portion you spoke of?” he asked,\nrather brusquely.\n\nThe French gentleman had also risen. He looked with an air of\nastonishment at his questioner, and then hardened his face. “I apologize\nfor mentioning it,” he said, with brevity. “One does not speak of family\naffairs.”\n\n“I asked you how much it was,” pursued Thorpe, in a masterful tone. “A\nman doesn't want to rob a girl of her marriage portion.”\n\n“I think I must not answer you,” the other replied, hesitatingly. “It\nwas the fault of my emotion to introduce the subject. Pray leave the\nyoung lady out of account.”\n\n“Then I've nothing more to say,” Thorpe declared, and seated himself\nagain with superfluous energy. He scowled for a little at the disorder\nof his desk, and then flung forth an angry explanation. “If you evade\nfair questions like that, how can you expect that I will go out of my\nway to help you?”\n\n“Oh, permit me, Mr. Thorpe”--the Marquis intervened soothingly--“I think\nyou misapprehend. My friend, I am sure, wished to evade nothing. He\nhad the idea that he was at fault in--in alluding to a purely domestic\nmatter as--as a--what shall I say?--as a plea for your consideration.”\n He turned to the old banker. “You will not refuse to mention the sum to\nme, will you, my friend?”\n\nM. Fromentin shrugged his shoulders. “It is ten thousand pounds,” he\nreplied, almost curtly.\n\nThorpe was seemingly mollified. “Very well, then,” he said. “I will sell\nyou 2,000 shares at ten pounds.”\n\nThe others exchanged a wondering look.\n\n“Monsieur,” the banker stammered--“I see your meaning. You will forgive\nme--it is very well meant indeed by you--but it was not my proposition.\nThe market-price is fifteen pounds--and we were prepared to pay it.”\n Thorpe laughed in a peremptory, gusty way. “But you can't pay more than\nI ask!” he told him, with rough geniality. “Come, if I let you and your\nnephew in out of the cold, what kind of men-folk would you be to insist\nthat your niece should be left outside? As I said, I don't want her\nmoney. I don't want any woman's money. If I'm going to be nice to the\nrest of the family, what's the objection to my being nice to her?”\n\n“Monsieur,” said the Frenchman, after an instant's reflection, “I offer\nnone. I did not at the moment perceive the spirit of your words, but\nI recognize now that it was delicacy itself. I tender you the most\nprofound thanks--for ALL the family.”\n\nAfter some further conversation the elder Fromentin took his departure.\nLord Chaldon apparently proposed to accompany him, but Thorpe begged him\nto remain, and he put aside his hat once more and resumed his seat.\n\nThorpe walked about a little, with his hands in his pockets, in a\nrestless way. “If it isn't unpleasant to you, I think I'll light a\ncigar,” he said suddenly, and moved over to the cabinet. He poured out a\ndrink of neat brandy, as well, and furtively swallowed it. Then he came\nback, preceded by a cloud of smoke.\n\n“It went terribly against the grain,” he said, with a rueful laugh. “I'd\nsworn to let no Jew off with an inch of hide left on him--and here three\nof them have been wheedled out of my grip already.”\n\n“Jews?” exclaimed the Marquis, much puzzled. “Did you--did you think\nFromentin was a Jew? God bless me! he's no more one than I am! Why, not\neven so much, for there IS a Herschell in my pedigree. Why, dear man,\nthey were Crusaders!”\n\nThorpe smiled somewhat sheepishly. “I never noticed much,” he said. “It\nwas a foreign-looking name. I took it for granted.”\n\nLord Chaldon bent his brows a little. “Yes-s”--he murmured,\nmeditatively. “I've heard it mentioned that your enterprise was\nsuspected of an anti-Semitic twist. Do you mind my talking a little with\nyou about that?”\n\n“Oh, not at all,” the other answered with languid acquiescence, as he\nseated himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nLORD CHALDON'S instructive little monologue on the subject of the\nHebrew in finance afforded Thorpe a certain pleasure, which was in its\ncharacter, perhaps, more social than intellectual.\n\nIt was both a flattering and striking experience to have so eminent a\nman at the side of one's desk, revealing for one's guidance the secrets\nof sovereigns and cabinets. Great names were mentioned in the course\nof this dissertation--mentioned with the authoritative ease of one who\ndined with princes and prime ministers--and Thorpe felt that he shared\nin the distinction of this familiarity with the august. He was in the\nposition of paying a salary to this courtly old nobleman and statesman,\nwho could tell him of his own intimate knowledge how Emperors conversed\nwith one another; how the Pope fidgeted in his ornate-carved chair when\nthe visitor talked on unwelcome topics; how a Queen and an opera-bouffe\ndancer waged an obscure and envenomed battle for the possession of a\ncounting-house strong box, and in the outcome a nation was armed with\ninferior old muskets instead of modern weapons, and the girl got the\ndifference expressed in black pearls.\n\nThese reminiscences seemed to alter the atmosphere, and even the\nappearance, of the Board Room. It was almost as if the apartment itself\nwas becoming historic, like those chambers they pointed out to the\ntourist wherein crowned heads had slept. The manner of the Marquis lent\nitself charmingly to this illusion. He spoke in a facile, mellifluous\nvoice, and as fluently as if he had been at work for a long time\npreparing a dissertation on this subject, instead of taking it up now by\nchance. In his tone, in his gestures, in the sustained friendliness\nof his facial expressions, there was a palpable desire to please his\nauditor--and Thorpe gave more heed to this than to the thread of the\ndiscourse. The facts that he heard now about the Jewish masters of\ninternational finance were doubtless surprising and suggestive to a\ndegree, but somehow they failed to stimulate his imagination. Lord\nChaldon's statesmanlike discussion of the uses to which they put\nthis vast power of theirs; his conviction that on the whole they were\nbeneficent; his dread of the consequences of any organized attempt to\ntake this power away from them, and put it into other and less capable\nhands--no doubt it was all very clever and wise, but Thorpe did not care\nfor it.\n\nAt the end he nodded, and, with a lumbering movement, altered his\nposition in his chair. The fixed idea of despoiling Rostocker, Aronson,\nGanz, Rothfoere, Lewis, and Mendel of their last sixpence had been in no\nwise affected by this entertaining homily. There appeared to be no need\nof pretending that it had been. If he knew anything of men and their\nmanners, his titled friend would not object to a change of topic.\n\n“Lord Chaldon,” he said abruptly, “we've talked enough about general\nmatters. While you're here, we might as well go into the subject of the\nCompany. Our annual meeting is pretty nearly due--but I think it would\nbe better to have it postponed. You see, this extraordinary development\nof dealing in our shares on the Stock Exchange has occupied my entire\nattention. There has been no time for arranging the machinery of\noperations on our property in Mexico. It's still there; it's all right.\nBut for the time being, the operations in London are so much more\nimportant. We should have nothing to tell our shareholders, if we\nbrought them together, except that their one-pound shares are worth\nfifteen pounds, and they know that already.”\n\nThe Marquis had listened with a shrewdly attentive eye upon the\nspeaker's face. The nervous affection of his eyelids gave him now a\nminute of blinking leisure in which to frame his comment. “I have not\nheard that my shares are worth fifteen pounds,” he said then, with a\ndirect, meaning little smile.\n\n“No,” Thorpe laughed, leaning comfortably back in his chair. “That's\nwhat I want to talk to you about. You see, when the Company was started,\nit was impossible to foresee that this dealing in our ordinary shares\nwould swamp everything else. If things had taken their usual course,\nand we had paid our attention to Mexico instead of to the London Stock\nExchange, my deferred vendor's shares, two thousand of which you hold,\nwould by this time be worth a good bit. As it is, unfortunately, they\nare outside of the deal. They have nothing to do with the movement of\nthe ordinary shares. But of course you understand all that.”\n\nLord Chaldon assented by an eloquent nod, at once resigned and hopeful.\n\n“Well--that is contrary to all my expectations--and intentions,” Thorpe\nresumed. “I don't want you to suffer by this unlooked-for change in the\nshape of things. You hold two thousand shares--only by accident they're\nthe wrong kind of shares. Very well: I'll make them the right kind\nof shares. I'll have a transfer sent to you tomorrow, so that you can\nreturn those vendor's shares to me, and in exchange for them I'll give\nyou two thousand fully-paid ordinary shares. You can sell these at once,\nif you like, or you can hold them on over one more settlement, whichever\nyou please.”\n\n“This is very munificent,” remarked Lord Chaldon, after an instant's\nself-communion. His tone was extremely gracious, but he displayed none\nof the enthusiastic excitement which Thorpe perceived now that he had\nlooked for. The equanimity of Marquises, who were also ex-Ambassadors,\nwas evidently a deeper-rooted affair than he had supposed. This elderly\nand urbane diplomat took a gift of thirty thousand pounds as he might\nhave accepted a superior cigar.\n\nA brief pause ensued, and was ended by another remark from the nobleman:\n“I thought for the moment of asking your advice--on this question of\nselling,” he continued. “But it will be put more appropriately, perhaps,\nin this way: Let me leave it entirely in your hands. Whatever you do\nwill be right. I know so little of these things--and you know so much.”\n\nThorpe put out his lips a trifle, and looked away for an instant in\nfrowning abstraction. “If it were put in that way--I think I should\nsell,” he said. “It's all right for me to take long chances--it's my\ngame--but there's no reason why you should risk things. But let me put\nit in still another way,” he added, with the passing gleam of a new\nthought over the dull surface of his eye. “What do you say to our making\nthe transaction strictly between ourselves? Here are shares to bearer,\nin the safe there. I say that two thousand of them are yours: that makes\nthem yours. I give you my cheque for thirty thousand pounds--here, now,\nif you like--and that makes them mine again. The business is finished\nand done with--inside this room. Neither of us is to say anything about\nit to a soul. Does that meet your views?”\n\nThe diplomat pondered the proposition--again with a lengthened\nperturbation of the eyelids. “It would be possible to suggest a variety\nof objections, if one were of a sophistical turn of mind,” he said at\nlast, smilingly reflective. “Yet I see no really insuperable obstacle\nin the path.” He thought upon it further, and went on with an enquiring\nupward glance directed suddenly at Thorpe: “Is there likely to be any\nvery unpleasant hubbub in the press--when it is known that the annual\nmeeting has been postponed?”\n\nThorpe shook his head with confidence. “No--you need have no fear of\nthat. The press is all right. It's the talk of the City, I'm told--the\nway I've managed the press. It isn't often that a man has all three of\nthe papers walking the same chalk-line.”\n\nThe Marquis considered these remarks with a puzzled air. Then he smiled\nfaintly. “I'm afraid we're speaking of different things,” he suggested.\n“Apparently you refer to the financial papers. I had scarcely given them\na thought. It does not seem to me that I should mind particularly what\nthey said about me--but I should care a great deal about the other\npress--the great public press.”\n\n“Oh, what do they know about these things?” said Thorpe, lightly. “So\nfar as I can see, they don't know about anything, unless it gets into\nthe police court, or the divorce court, or a court of some kind. They're\nthe funniest sort of papers I ever saw. Seems as if they didn't think\nanything was safe to be printed until it had been sworn to. Why anybody\nshould be afraid of them is more than I can see.”\n\n“Nevertheless,” persisted his Lordship, blandly, “I should greatly\ndislike any public discussion of our Company's affairs. I hope it is\nquite clear that that can be avoided.”\n\n“Absolutely!” Thorpe told him, with reassuring energy. “Why, discussions\ndon't make themselves. Somebody has to kick before anything gets\ndiscussed. And who is to kick here? The public who hold the shares are\nnot likely to complain because they've gone up fifteen hundred or two\nthousand per cent. And who else has any interest in what the Company, as\na Company, does?”\n\n“Ah, that is a question which has occurred to me,” said Lord Chaldon,\n“and I shall be glad if it is already answered. The only people likely\nto 'kick,' as you put it so simply, would be, I take it, Directors and\nother officers of the Company who find themselves holding a class of\nshares which does not participate in the present rise. I speak with some\nconfidence--because I was in that position myself until a few\nminutes ago--and I don't mind confessing that I had brought myself to\ncontemplate the contingency of ultimately being compelled to--to 'kick'\na little. Of course, so far as I am concerned, events have put me in a\ndiametrically different frame of mind. If I came prepared--I won't say\nto curse, but to--to criticize--I certainly remain to bless. But you\nsee my point. I of course do not know what you have done as regards the\nother members of the Board.”\n\n“I don't care about them,” said Thorpe, carelessly. “You are the one\nthat I wished to bring in on the ground-floor. The others don't matter.\nOf course, I shall do something for them; they shan't be allowed to make\ntrouble--even supposing that it would be in their power to make trouble,\nwhich isn't the case. But it won't be done by any means on the same\nscale that--” he paused abruptly, and the two men tacitly completed his\nsentence in the glance they exchanged.\n\nThe Marquis of Chaldon rose, and took up his hat and stick. “If you\nwill post it to me--in a registered letter--my town house--please,” he\nremarked, with a charmingly delicate hesitation over the phrases. Then\nhe put out his hand: “I need not say how fully I appreciate your great\nkindness to my old friend Fromentin. It was a noble action--one I shall\nalways reflect upon with admiration.”\n\n“I hope you won't mention it, though,” said Thorpe, as they shook hands;\n“either that or--or anything else.”\n\n“I shall preserve the most guarded--the most diplomatic secrecy,” his\nLordship assured him, as they walked toward the door.\n\nThorpe opened this door, and stepped aside, with a half bow, to\nfacilitate the exit of the Marquis, who bent gracious acknowledgment\nof the courtesy. Then, with an abrupt start of surprise, the two men\nstraightened themselves. Directly in front of them, leaning lightly\nagainst the brass-rail which guarded the entrance to the Board Room,\nstood Lord Plowden.\n\nA certain sense of confusion, unwelcome but inevitable, visibly\nenveloped this chance meeting. The Marquis blinked very hard as he\nexchanged a fleeting hand-shake with the younger nobleman, and murmured\nsome indistinguishable commonplaces. Then, with a graceful celerity,\nwhich was more than diplomatic, he disappeared. Thorpe, with more\ndifficulty, recovered a sort of stolidity of expression that might pass\nfor composure. He in turn gave his hand to the newcomer, and nodded to\nhim, and achieved a doubtful smile.\n\n“Come in!” he said, haltingly. “Where did you drop from? Glad to see\nyou! How are all your people?”\n\nA moment later the young Viscount was seated in the chair which the\nelderly Marquis had vacated. He presented therein a figure which, in\nits way, was perhaps as courtly as the other had been--but the way was\nwidely different. Lord Plowden's fine, lithe form expressed no deference\nin its easy postures. His handsome face was at no pains to assume\nconciliatory or ingratiating aspects. His brilliant brown eyes sparkled\na confident, buoyant gaze full into the heavy, lethargic countenance of\nthe big man at the desk.\n\n“I haven't bothered you before,” he said, tossing his gloves into his\nhat, and spreading his frock-coat out by its silk lapels. He crossed his\nlegs, and sat back with a comfortable smile. “I knew you were awfully\nbusy--and I kept away as long as I could. But now--well, the truth\nis--I'm in rather of a hole. I hope you don't mind my coming.”\n\n“Why not at all,” said Thorpe, laconically. After a momentary pause he\nadded: “The Marquis has just been consulting me about the postponement\nof the annual meeting. I suppose you agree with us--that it would be\nbetter to put it off. There's really nothing to report. Of course,\nyou know more about the situation than he does--between ourselves.\nThe shareholders don't want a meeting; it's enough for them that their\nshares are worth fifteen or twenty times what they paid for them. And\ncertainly WE don't need a meeting, as things stand now.”\n\n“Ah yes--how do things stand now?” asked Lord Plowden, briskly.\n\n“Well,”--Thorpe eyed his visitor with a moody blankness of gaze, his\nchin once more buried in his collar--“well, everything is going all\nright, as far as I can see. But, of course, these dealings in our shares\nin the City have taken up all my time--so that I haven't been able to\ngive any attention to starting up work in Mexico. That being the case, I\nshall arrange to foot all the bills for this year's expenses--the rent,\nthe Directors' fees and clerk-hire and so on--out of my own pocket. It\ncomes, all told, to about 2,700 pounds--without counting my extra 1,000\npounds as Managing Director. I don't propose to ask for a penny of that,\nunder the circumstances--and I'll even pay the other expenses. So that\nthe Company isn't losing a penny by our not getting to work at the\ndevelopment of the property. No one could ask anything fairer than\nthat.--And are your mother and sister quite well?”\n\n“Oh, very well indeed, thanks,” replied the other. He relapsed abruptly\ninto a silence which was plainly preoccupied. Something of the radiant\ncheerfulness with which his face had beamed seemed to have faded away.\n\n“I'm in treaty for a house and a moor in the Highlands”--Thorpe went on,\nin a casual tone--“in fact, I'm hesitating between three or four places\nthat all seem to be pretty good--but I don't know whether I can get away\nmuch before the twentieth. I hope you can contrive to come while I'm\nthere. I should like it very much if you would bring your mother and\nsister--and your brother too. I have a nephew about his age--a fine\nyoung fellow--who'd be company for him. Why can't you say now that\nyou'll all come?”\n\nLord Plowden emerged from his brown study with the gleam of some new\nidea on his face. “I might bring my sister,” he said. “My mother hates\nScotland. She doesn't go about, either, even in England. But I daresay\nWinnie would enjoy it immensely. She has a great opinion of you, you\nknow.”\n\n“I only saw her that once,” Thorpe remarked. Some thought behind his\nwords lent a musing effect to the tone in which they were uttered. The\nbrother's contemplative smile seemed a comment upon this tone.\n\n“Women are curious creatures,” he said. “They take fancies and dislikes\nas swiftly and irresponsibly as cloud-shadows shift and change on a\nmountain-side in April. But I happen to know that my sister does like\nyou immensely. So does my mother,” he added, with another little smile.\nHe continued to regard Thorpe's face, but there was an increasing\nuncertainty in his glance. “You've put on flesh, haven't you?” he\nventured, after a brief pause. There was the implication in his voice\nand manner that he observed changes which disconcerted him.\n\n“Not much, I guess,” replied the other, carelessly. “I've been\nsticking to the City pretty closely. That's all. There's nothing that\na fortnight's rest won't put right. I should like it first-rate to have\nyou and your sister come. I'll let you know which place I decide upon.\nVery likely you can manage to bring her at the same time that some other\nladies will be there. I expect Lady Cressage and Miss Madden, you know.”\n\nLord Plowden stared at his friend. “Are they back? Have they returned to\nEngland?” he asked, confusedly.\n\n“Oh, didn't you know?” Thorpe pursued, with an accession of amiability.\nHe visibly had pleasure in the disclosure of the other's ignorance.\n“They've been in London for two or three weeks. That is, Miss Madden has\nbeen taking flying trips to see cathedrals and so on, but Lady Cressage\nhas stayed in town. Their long journeyings have rather done her up.”\n He looked Plowden straight in the eye, and added with an air of\ndeliberation: “I'm rather anxious about her health.”\n\nThe nobleman frankly abandoned his efforts to maintain an undisturbed\nfront. “You--are--anxious,” he repeated, frowning in displeased\nwonderment.\n\n“Why yes--why not?” demanded Thorpe, with a sudden growl in his voice.\nAs he covered the handsome Viscount with his heavy, intent gaze,\nimpulses of wrath stirred within him. Why should this fop of a lordling\nput on this air of contemptuous incredulity? “What is there so amazing\nabout that? Why shouldn't I be anxious?”\n\nThe peremptory harshness of his manner, and the scowl on his big,\nlowering face, brought a sort of self-control back to the other.\nHe shrugged his shoulders, with an attempt at nonchalance. “Why not\nindeed!” he said, as lightly as he could. With hands on knees, he bent\nforward as if to rise. “But perhaps I'd better come in another day,” he\nsuggested, tentatively. “I'm interrupting you.”\n\n“No--sit still,” Thorpe bade him, and then, with chin settled more\ndeterminedly than ever in his cravat, sat eyeing him in a long, dour\nsilence.\n\nLord Plowden found it impossible to obtain from this massive, apathetic\nvisage any clue to the thoughts working behind it. He chanced to recall\nthe time when he had discussed with Thorpe the meaning and values of\nthis inscrutable expression which the latter's countenance could assume.\nIt had seemed interesting and even admirable to him then--but then he\nhad not foreseen the possibility that he himself might some day confront\nits adamantine barrier with a sinking heart. All at once he could bear\nthis implacable sphinx-gaze no longer.\n\n“I'm sure some other day would be better,” he urged, with an open\noverture to propitiation in his tone. “You're not in the mood to be\nbothered with my affairs today.”\n\n“As much today as any other,” Thorpe answered him, slowly.\n\nThe other sat suddenly upright--and then upon a moment's reflection rose\nto his feet. “I don't in the least know what to make of all this,” he\nsaid, with nervous precipitancy. “If I've offended you in any way, say\nso, and I will apologize at once. But treatment of this sort passes my\ncomprehension.”\n\nThorpe in truth did not himself comprehend it much more clearly. Some\nstrange freak of wilfulness impelled him to pursue this unintelligible\npersecution. “I've said nothing about any offense,” he declared, in a\nhard, deliberate voice. “It is your own word. All the same--I mention\nthe name of a lady--a lady, mind you, whom I met under your own\nroof--and you strike attitudes and put on airs as if--as if I wasn't\ngood enough!”\n\n“Oh, upon my word, that's all rubbish!” the other broke in. “Nothing\ncould have been further from my thoughts, I assure you. Quite naturally\nI was surprised for the moment at a bit of unexpected news--but that was\nall. I give you my word that was all.”\n\n“Very well, then,” Thorpe consented grudgingly to mutter.\n\nHe continued his sullen scrutiny of the man standing before him, noting\nhow the vivacity of his bearing had deteriorated in these few minutes.\nHe had cut such a gallant figure when he entered the room, with his\nsparkling eye and smile, his almost jaunty manner, his superior tailor's\nplumage--and now he was such a crestfallen and wilted thing! Remembering\ntheir last conversation together--remembering indeed how full of liking\nfor this young nobleman he had been when they last met--Thorpe paused\nto wonder at the fact that he felt no atom of pity for him now. What was\nhis grievance? What had Plowden done to provoke this savage hostility?\nThorpe could not tell. He knew only that unnamed forces dragged him\nforward to hurt and humiliate his former friend. Obscurely, no doubt,\nthere was something about a woman in it. Plowden had been an admirer of\nLady Cressage. There was her father's word for it that if there had been\nmoney enough he would have wished to marry her. There had been, as well,\nthe General's hint that if the difficulty of Plowden's poverty\nwere removed, he might still wish to marry her--a hint which Thorpe\ndiscovered to be rankling with a sudden new soreness in his mind. Was\nthat why he hated Plowden? No--he said to himself that it was not.\nHe was going to marry Lady Cressage himself. Her letter, signifying\ndelicately her assent to his proposal, had come to him that very\nmorning--was in his pocket now. What did he care about the bye-gone\naspirations of other would-be suitors? And, as for Plowden, he had\nnot even known of her return to London. Clearly there remained no\ncommunications of any sort between them. It was not at all on her\naccount, he assured himself, that he had turned against Plowden. But\nwhat other reason could there be? He observed his visitor's perturbed\nand dejected mien with a grim kind of satisfaction--but still he could\nnot tell why.\n\n“This is all terribly important to me,” the nobleman said, breaking\nthe unpleasant silence. His voice was surcharged with earnestness.\n“Apparently you are annoyed with something--what it may be I can't for\nthe life of me make out. All I can say is”--and he broke off with a\nhelpless gesture which seemed to imply that he feared to say anything.\n\nThorpe put out his lips. “I don't know what you mean,” he said,\nbrusquely.\n\n“What I mean”--the other echoed, with bewildered vagueness of glance.\n“I'm all at sea. I don't in the least grasp the meaning of anything. You\nyourself volunteered the declaration that you would do great things for\nme. 'We are rich men together'--those were your own words. I urged you\nat the time to go slowly--to consider carefully whether you weren't\nbeing too generous. I myself said to you that you were ridiculously\nexaggerating what you called your obligation to me. It was you who\ninsisted upon presenting me with 100,000 shares.”\n\n“Well, they are here ready for you,” said Thorpe, with calculated\ncoldness. “You can have them whenever you please. I promised them to\nyou, and set them aside for you. You can take them away with you now,\nif you like. What are you kicking up this fuss for, then? Upon my\nword!--you come here and suggest to me that I made promises to you which\nI've broken!”\n\nPlowden looked hard at him, as he turned over in his mind the purport of\nthese words. “I see what you are doing,” he said then. “You turn over\nto me 100,000 vendor's deferred shares. Thanks! I have already 1,000 of\nthem. I keep them in the same box with my father's Confederate bonds.”\n\n“What the hell do you mean?” Thorpe broke in with explosive warmth,\nlifting himself in his chair.\n\n“Oh, come now, Thorpe,” Plowden retorted, “let's get this talk on an\nintelligent, common-sense footing.” He had regained something of his\nself-control, and keenly put forward now to help him all his persuasive\ngraces of eye and speech. He seated himself once more. “I'm convinced\nthat you want to be good to me. Of course you do! If I've seemed here\nfor a minute or two to think otherwise, it was because I misunderstood\nthings. Don't let there be any further misunderstandings! I apologize\nfor doing you the momentary injustice of suspecting that you were going\nto play off the vendor's shares on me. Of course you said it--but it was\na joke.”\n\n“There seems to be a joke somewhere, sure enough,” said Thorpe, in dryly\nmetallic tones--“but it isn't me who's the joker. I told you you should\nhave 100,000 of my 400,000 shares, didn't I? I told you that in so many\nwords. Very well, what more do you want? Here they are for you! I keep\nmy promise to the letter. But you--you seem to think you're entitled to\nmake a row. What do you mean by it?”\n\n“Just a little word”--interposed Plowden, with strenuous calmness of\nutterance--“what you say may be true enough--yes, I admit it is true as\nfar as it goes. But was that what either of us had in our minds at\nthe time? You know it wasn't! You had just planned a coup on the Stock\nExchange which promised you immense rewards. I helped you to pass a\nbogus allotment through our Board--without which your coup wouldn't have\nbeen worth a farthing. You were enthusiastically grateful to me then. In\nthe excitement of the moment you promised me a quarter of all you should\nmake. 'WE ARE BOTH RICH MEN!' I remember those very words of yours. They\nhave never been out of my mind. We discussed the things that we would\neach do, when we came into this wealth. It was taken for granted in all\nour talk that your making money meant also my making money. That was the\ncomplete understanding--here in London, and while you were at my house.\nYou know it as well as I do. And I refuse to suppose that you seriously\nintend to sit there and pretend that you meant to give me nothing but an\narmful of waste paper. It would be too monstrous!”\n\nThorpe rapped with his nails on the desk, to point the force of his\nrejoinder: “How do you account for the fact, my Lord”--he gave his\nwords a chillingly scornful precision of utterance--“that I distinctly\nmentioned 400,000 vendor's shares of mine, 100,000 of which I promised\nto turn over to you? Those were the specific terms, were they not? You\ndon't deny it? Then what are you talking about?”\n\n“I account for it in this way”--said Plowden, after a moment's baffled\nreflection: “at that time you yourself hadn't grasped the difference\nbetween the two classes of shares. You thought the vendor's shares would\nplay a part in the game. Ah! I see I've hit the mark! That was the way\nof it!--And now here, Thorpe! Let all that's been said be bye-gones! I\ndon't want any verbal triumph over you. You don't want to wrong me--and\nyourself too--by sticking to this quibble about vendor's shares. You\nintended to be deuced good to me--and what have I done that you should\nround on me now? I haven't bothered you before. I came today only\nbecause things are particularly rotten, financially, just now. And I\ndon't even want to hold you to a quarter--I leave that entirely to you.\nBut after all that's been said and done--I put it to you as one man to\nanother--you are morally bound to help me out.”\n\n“How do you mean?--'all that's been said and done'?” Thorpe asked the\nquestion in some confusion of moods. Perhaps it was the ethical force\nof Lord Plowden's appeal, perhaps only a recurring sense of his earlier\naffection for the man--but for the moment he wavered in his purpose.\n\nThe peer flushed a little, as he looked at the floor, revolving possible\nanswers to this query. His ear had been quick to seize the note of\nhesitation in Thorpe's tone. He strove anxiously to get together\nconsiderations which should tip the fluttering balance definitely his\nway.\n\n“Well,” he began slowly, “I hardly know how to put it. Of course there\nwas, in the first place, the immense expectation of fortune which you\ngave me, and which I'm afraid I've more than lived up to. And then, of\ncourse, others shared my expectations. It wasn't a thing one could\nvery well keep to oneself. My mother and my sister--especially my\nsister--they were wonderfully excited about it. You are quite the hero\nin their eyes. And then--you remember that talk we had, in which you\nsaid I could help you--socially, you know. I did it a little, just as a\nstart, but of course there's no end to what could be done. You've been\ntoo busy heretofore, but we can begin now whenever you like. I don't\nmind telling you--I've had some thoughts of a possible marriage for you.\nIn point of blood and connections it would be such a match as a commoner\nhasn't made before in my memory--a highly-cultivated and highly-bred\nyoung lady of rank--and settlements could be made so that a considerable\nquantity of land would eventually come to your son. I needn't tell you\nthat land stands for much more than money, if you happen to set your\nmind on a baronetcy or a peerage. Of course--I need scarcely say--I\nmention this marriage only as something which may or may not attract\nyou,--it is quite open to you to prefer another,--but there is hardly\nanything of that sort in which I and my connections could not be of use\nto you.”\n\nEven more by the tone and inflection of these words than by the phrases\nthemselves, Thorpe divined that he was being offered the hand of the\nHon. Winifred Plowden in marriage. He recalled vividly the fact that\nonce the shadow of some such thought had floated through his own\nbrain; there had been a moment--it seemed curiously remote, like a\ndream-phantom from some previous state of existence--when he had dwelt\nwith personal interest upon her inheritance from long lines of noblemen,\nand her relation to half the peerage. Then, swiftly, illogically, he\ndisliked the brother of this lady more than ever.\n\n“All that is talking in the air,” he said, with abrupt decision. “I\nsee nothing in it. You shall have your vendor's shares, precisely as I\npromised you. I don't see how you can possibly ask for anything more.”\n He looked at the other's darkling face for a moment, and then rose with\nunwieldy deliberation. “If you're so hard up though,” he continued,\ncoldly, “I don't mind doing this much for you. I'll exchange the\nthousand vendor's shares you already hold the ones I gave you to qualify\nyou at the beginning--for ordinary shares. You can sell those for\nfifteen thousand pounds cash. In fact, I'll buy them of you now. I'll\ngive you a cheque for the amount. Do you want it?”\n\nLord Plowden, red-faced and frowning, hesitated for a fraction of time.\nThen in constrained silence he nodded, and Thorpe, leaning ponderously\nover the desk, wrote out the cheque. His Lordship took it, folded it up,\nand put it in his pocket without immediate comment.\n\n“Then this is the end of things, is it?” he asked, after an awkward\nsilence, in a voice he strove in vain to keep from shaking.\n\n“What things?” said the other.\n\nPlowden shrugged his shoulders, framed his lips to utter something which\nhe decided not to say, and at last turned on his heel. “Good day,” he\ncalled out over his shoulder, and left the room with a flagrant air of\nhostility.\n\nThorpe, wandering about the apartment, stopped after a time at the\ncabinet, and helped himself to a drink. The thing most apparent to him\nwas that of set purpose he had converted a friend into an enemy. Why had\nhe done this? He asked himself the question in varying forms, over his\nbrandy and soda, but no convincing answer came. He had done it because\nhe had felt like doing it. It was impossible to trace motives further\nthan that.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\n“EDITH will be down in a very few moments,” Miss Madden assured Thorpe\nthat evening, when he entered the drawing-room of the house she had\ntaken in Grafton Street.\n\nHe looked into her eyes and smiled, as he bowed over the hand she\nextended to him. His glance expressed with forceful directness his\nthought: “Ah, then she has told you!”\n\nThe complacent consciousness of producing a fine effect in\nevening-clothes had given to Mr. Stormont Thorpe habitually now a\nmildness of manner, after the dressing hour, which was lacking to his\ndeportment in the day-time. The conventional attire of ceremony, juggled\nin the hands of an inspired tailor, had been brought to lend to his\nponderous figure a dignity, and even something of a grace, which the\nman within assimilated and made his own. It was an equable and rather\namiable Thorpe whom people encountered after nightfall--a gentleman who\nlooked impressive enough to have powerful performances believed of him,\nyet seemed withal an approachable and easy-going person. Men who saw\nhim at midnight or later spoke of him to their womenkind with a certain\nsignificant reserve, in which trained womankind read the suggestion that\nthe “Rubber King” drank a good deal, and was probably not wholly nice in\nhis cups.\n\nThis, however, could not be said to render him less interesting in any\neyes. There was indeed about it the implication of a generous nature, or\nat the least of a blind side--and it is not unpleasant to discover these\nattributes in a new man who has made his half-million, and has, or may\nhave, countless favours to bestow.\n\nIt was as if his tongue instead of his eyes had uttered the\nexclamation--“Ah, then she has told you!”--for Miss Madden took it as\nhaving been spoken. “I'm not disposed to pretend that I'm overjoyed\nabout it, you know,” she said to him bluntly, as their hands dropped,\nand they stood facing each other. “If I said I congratulated you, it\nwould be only the emptiest form. And I hate empty forms.”\n\n“Why should you think that I won't make a good husband?” Thorpe asked\nthe question with a good-natured if peremptory frankness which came\nmost readily to him in the presence of this American lady, herself so\noutspoken and masterful.\n\n“I don't know that I specially doubt it,” she replied. “I suppose any\nman has in him the makings of what is called a good husband--if the\nconditions are sufficiently propitious.”\n\n“Well then--what's the matter with the conditions?” he demanded,\njocosely.\n\nMiss Madden shrugged her shoulders slightly. Thorpe noted the somewhat\nluxuriant curves of these splendid shoulders, and the creamy whiteness\nof the skin, upon which, round the full throat, a chain of diamonds lay\nas upon satin--and recalled that he had not seen her before in what he\nphrased to himself as so much low-necked dress. The deep fire-gleam in\nher broad plaits of hair gave a wonderful brilliancy to this colouring\nof brow and throat and bosom. He marvelled at himself for discovering\nonly now that she also was beautiful--and then thrilled with pride at\nthe thought that henceforth his life might be passed altogether among\nbeautiful women, radiant in gems and costly fabrics, who would smile\nupon him at his command.\n\n“Oh, I have no wish to be a kill-joy,” she protested. “I'm sure I hope\nall manner of good results from the--the experiment.”\n\n“I suppose that's what it comes to,” he said, meditatively. “It's all an\nexperiment. Every marriage in the world must be that--neither more nor\nless.”\n\n“With all the experience of the ages against its coming out right.” She\nhad turned to move toward a chair, but looked now over her shoulder at\nhim. “Have you ever seen what seemed to you an absolutely happy marriage\nin your life?”\n\nUpon reflection he shook his head. “I don't recall one on the spur of\nthe minute,” he confessed. “Not the kind, I mean, that you read about\nin books. But I've seen plenty where the couple got along together in\na good, easy, comfortable sort of way, without a notion of any sort\nof unpleasantness. It's people who marry too young who do most of the\nfighting, I imagine. After people have got to a sensible age, and know\nwhat they want and what they can get along without, why then there's\nno reason for any trouble. We don't start out with any school-boy and\nschool-girl moonshine.”\n\n“Oh, there's a good deal to be said for the moonshine,” she interrupted\nhim, as she sank upon the sofa.\n\n“Why certainly,” he assented, amiably, as he stood looking down at her.\n“The more there is of it, the better--if it comes naturally, and people\nknow enough to understand that it is moonshine, and isn't the be-all and\nend-all of everything.”\n\n“There's a lover for you!” Miss Madden cried, with mirth and derision\nmingled in her laugh.\n\n“Don't you worry about me,” he told her. “I'm a good enough lover,\nall right. And when you come to that, if Edith is satisfied, I don't\nprecisely see what----”\n\n“What business it is of mine?” she finished the sentence for him.\n“You're entirely right. As you say, IF she's satisfied, no one else has\nanything to do with it.”\n\n“But have you got any right to assume that she isn't satisfied?” he\nasked her with swift directness--“or any reason for supposing it?”\n\nMiss Madden shook her head, but the negation seemed qualified by the\nwhimsical smile she gave him. “None whatever,” she said--and on the\ninstant the talk was extinguished by the entrance of Lady Cressage.\n\nThorpe's vision was flooded with the perception of his rare fortune as\nhe went to meet her. He took the hand she offered, and looked into the\nsmile of her greeting, and could say nothing. Her beauty had gathered to\nit new forces in his eyes--forces which dazzled and troubled his glance.\nThe thought that this exquisite being--this ineffable compound\nof feeling and fine nerves and sweet wisdom and wit and\nloveliness--belonged to him seemed too vast for the capacity of his\nmind. He could not keep himself from trembling a little, and from\ndiverting to a screen beyond her shoulder a gaze which he felt to be\novertly dimmed and embarrassed.\n\n“I have kept you waiting,” she murmured.\n\nThe soft sound of her voice came to his ears as from a distance. It\nbore an unfamiliar note, upon the strangeness of which he dwelt for a\ndetached instant. Then its meaning broke in upon his consciousness from\nall sides, and lighted up his heavy face with the glow of a conqueror's\nself-centred smile. He bent his eyes upon her, and noted with a\ncontrolled exaltation how her glance in turn deferred to his, and\nfluttered beneath it, and shrank away. He squared his big shoulders and\nlifted his head. Still holding her jewelled hand in his, he turned\nand led her toward the sofa. Halting, he bowed with an exaggerated\ngenuflection and flourish of his free hand to Miss Madden, the while he\nflashed at her a glance at once of challenge and of deprecation. Through\nthe sensitized contact of the other hand, he felt that the woman he held\nbowed also, and in his own spirit of confused defiance and entreaty.\nThe laugh he gave then seemed to dispel the awkwardness which had\nmomentarily hung over the mocking salutation.\n\nMiss Madden laughed too. “Oh, I surrender,” she said. “You drag\ncongratulations from me.”\n\nSome quality in the tone of this ungracious speech had the effect of\nputting the party at its ease. Lady Cressage seated herself beside her\nfriend on the sofa, and gently, abstractedly, patted one of her hands.\nThorpe remained on his feet, looking down at the pair with satisfied\ncheerfulness. He tool, a slip of paper from his pocket, to support a\nstatement he was making.\n\n“I'm forever telling you what a strain the City is on a man in my\nposition,” he said--“and today I had the curiosity to keep an account of\nwhat happened. Here it is. I had thirty callers. Of those, how many do\nyou suppose came to see me on my own business? Just eight. That is to\nsay, their errands were about investments of mine, but most of them\nmanaged to get in some word about axes of their own to grind. All the\nrest made no pretence at all of thinking about anybody but themselves.\nI've classified them, one by one, here.\n\n“First, there were six men who wanted me to take shares of one sort or\nanother, and I had to more or less listen to what they tried to make\nout their companies were like. They were none of them any good. Eight\ndifferent fellows came to me with schemes that haven't reached the\ncompany stage. One had a scheme for getting possession of a nigger\nrepublic in the West Indies by raising a loan, and then repudiating all\nthe previous loans. Another wanted me to buy a paper for him, in which\nhe was to support all my enterprises. Another wanted to start a bank--I\napparently to find the money, and he the brains. One chap wanted me to\nfinance a theatrical syndicate--he had a bag full of photographs of an\nactress all eyes and teeth and hair,--and another chap had a scheme all\nworked out for getting a concession from Spain for one of the Caroline\nIslands, and putting up a factory there for making porpoise-hide\nleather.\n\n“Then there were three inventors--let's see, here they are--one with a\ncoiled wire spring for scissors inside a pocket-knife, and one with\na bottle, the whole top of which unscrews instead of having a cork or\nstopper, and one with an electrical fish-line, a fine wire inside the\nsilk, you know, which connects with some battery when a fish bites, and\nrings a bell, and throws out hooks in various directions, and does all\nsorts of things.\n\n“Well then, there was a man who wanted me to take the chairmanship of\na company, and one who wanted me to guarantee an overdraft at his bank,\nand two who wanted to borrow money on stock, and one parson-fellow who\ntried to stick me for a subscription to some Home or other he said he\nhad for children in the country. He was the worst bounder of the lot.\n\n“Well, there's twenty-seven people--and twenty of them strangers to\nme, and not worth a penny to me, and all trying to get money out of me.\nIsn't that a dog's life for one?”\n\n“I don't know,” said Miss Madden, contemplatively. “A lady may have\ntwice that number of callers in an afternoon--quite as great strangers\nto all intents and purposes--and not even have the satisfaction of\ndiscovering that they had any object whatever in calling. At least your\npeople had some motive: the grey matter in their brain was working. And\nbesides, one of them might have had something to say which you would\nvalue. I don't think that ever happens among a lady's callers; does it,\nEdith?”\n\nEdith smiled, pleasantly and yet a little wistfully, but said nothing.\n\n“At any rate,” Thorpe went on, with a kind of purpose gathering in his\neyes, “none of those fellows cost me anything, except in time. But then\nI had three callers, almost in a bunch, and one of them took out of me\nthirty thousand pounds, and another fifteen thousand pounds, and the\nthird--an utter stranger he was--he got an absolute gratuity of ten\nthousand pounds, besides my consent to a sale which, if I had refused\nit, would have stood me in perhaps forty or fifty thousand pounds more.\nYou ladies may thank your stars you don't have that kind of callers!”\n\nThe sound of these figures in the air brought a constrained look to the\nfaces of the women. Seemingly they confronted a subject which was not to\ntheir liking. The American, however, after a moment's pause, took it up\nin an indifferent manner.\n\n“You speak of an 'absolute gratuity.' I know nothing of London City\nmethods--but isn't ten thousand pounds a gratuity on a rather large\nscale?”\n\nThorpe hesitated briefly, then smiled, and, with slow deliberation, drew\nup a chair and seated himself before them. “Perhaps I don't mind telling\nyou about it,” he began, and paused again. “I had a letter in my mail\nthis morning,” he went on at last, giving a sentimental significance to\nboth tone and glance--“a letter which changed everything in the world\nfor me, and made me the proudest and happiest man above ground. And\nI put that letter in my pocket, right here on the left side--and it's\nthere now, for that matter”--he put his hand to his breast, as if under\nthe impulse to verify his words by the production of the missive, and\nthen stopped and flushed.\n\nThe ladies, watching him, seemed by their eyes to condone the\nmawkishness of the demonstration which had tempted him. There was indeed\na kind of approving interest in their joint regard, which he had not\nexperienced before.\n\n“I had it in my pocket,” he resumed, with an accession of mellow emotion\nin his voice, “and none of the callers ever got my thoughts very far\nfrom that letter. And one of these was an old man--a French banker who\nmust be seventy years old, but dyes his hair a kind of purple black--and\nit seems that his nephew had got the firm into a terrible kind of\nscrape, selling 2,000 of my shares when he hadn't got them to sell and\ncouldn't get them--and the old man came to beg me to let him out at\npresent market figures. He got Lord Chaldon--he's my Chairman, you\nknow--to bring him, and introduce him as his friend, and plead for\nhim--but I don't think all that, by itself, would have budged me an\natom. But then the old man told how he was just able to scrape together\nmoney enough to buy the shares he needed, at the ruling price, and he\nhappened to mention that his niece's marriage portion would have to\nbe sacrificed. Well, then, do you know, that letter in my pocket said\nsomething to me....And--well, that's the story. The girl' s portion, I\nwormed it out of him, was ten thousand...and I struck that much off\nthe figure that I allowed him to buy his shares, and save his firm,\nfor....It was all the letter that did it, mind you!”\n\nHe concluded the halting narrative amid a marked silence. The ladies\nlooked at him and at each other, but they seemed surprised out of their\nfacility of comment. In this kind of flustered hush, the door was opened\nand dinner was announced.\n\nMiss Madden welcomed the diversion by rising with ostentatious vigour.\n“I will take myself out,” she declared, with cheerful promptness leading\nthe way. Lady Cressage took the arm Thorpe offered her, and gave no\ntoken of comprehending that her wrist was being caressingly pressed\nagainst his side as they moved along.\n\nAt the little table shining in the centre of the dark, cool dining-room,\ntalk moved idly about among general topics. A thunderstorm broke over\nthe town, at an early stage of the dinner, and the sound of the rushing\ndownpour through the open windows, and the breath of freshness which\nstirred the jaded air, were pleasanter than any speech. Thoughts roved\nintuitively country-ward, where the long-needed rain would be dowering\nthe landscape with new life--where the earth at sunrise would be green\nagain, and buoyant in reawakened energy, and redolent with the perfumes\nof sweetest summer. They spoke of the fields and the moors with the\nlonging of tired town-folk in August.\n\n“Oh, when I get away”--said Thorpe, fervently, “it seems to me that I\ndon't want ever to come back. These last few weeks have got terribly on\nmy nerve. And really--why should I come back? I've been asking myself\nthe question--more today than ever before. Of course everything has\nbeen different today. But if I'm to get any genuine good out of my--my\nfortune--I must pull away from the City altogether sometime--and why not\nnow? Of course, some important things are still open--and they have to\nbe watched night and day--but after all, Semple--that's my Broker--he\ncould do it for me. At the most, it won't last more than another six\nweeks. There is a settlement-day next week, the 15th, and another a\nfortnight after, on the 29th, and another on September 12th. Well, those\nthree days, if they're worked as I intend they shall be, and nothing\nunforeseen happens, will bring in over four hundred thousand pounds, and\nclose the 'corner' in Rubber Consols for good. Then I need never see the\nCity again, thank God! And for that matter--why, what is six weeks?\nIt's like tomorrow. I'm going to act as if I were free already. The rain\nfills me full of the country. Will you both come with me tomorrow\nor next day, and see the Pellesley place in Hertfordshire? By the\nphotographs it's the best thing in the market. The newest parts of it\nare Tudor--and that's what I've always wanted.”\n\n“How unexpected you are!” commented Miss Madden. “You are almost\nthe last person I should have looked to for a sentiment about Tudor\nfoundations.”\n\nThorpe put out his lips a trifle. “Ah, you don't know me,” he replied,\nin a voice milder than his look had promised. “Because I'm rough and\npractical, you mustn't think I don't know good things when I see them.\nWhy, all the world is going to have living proof very soon”--he paused,\nand sent a smile surcharged with meaning toward the silent member of the\ntrio--“living proof that I'm the greatest judge of perfection in beauty\nof my time.”\n\nHe lifted his glass as he spoke, and the ladies accepted with an\ninclination of the head, and a touch of the wine at their lips, his\ntacit toast. “Oh, I think I do know you,” said Celia Madden, calmly\ndiscursive. “Up to a certain point, you are not so unlike other men. If\npeople appeal to your imagination, and do not contradict you, or bore\nyou, or get in your way, you are capable of being very nice indeed\nto them. But that isn't a very uncommon quality. What is uncommon\nin you--at least that is my reading--is something which according\nto circumstances may be nice, or very much the other way about. It's\nsomething which stands quite apart from standards of morals or ethics or\nthe ordinary emotions. But I don't know, whether it is desirable for me\nto enter into this extremely personal analysis.”\n\n“Oh yes, go on,” Thorpe urged her. He watched her face with an almost\nexcited interest.\n\n“Well--I should say that you possessed a capacity for sudden and\ncapricious action in large matters, equally impatient of reasoning\nand indifferent to consequences, which might be very awkward, and even\ntragic, to people who happened to annoy you, or stand in your road. You\nhave the kind of organization in which, within a second, without any\nwarning or reason, a passing whim may have worked itself up into an\nimperative law--something you must obey.”\n\nThe man smiled and nodded approvingly: “You've got me down fine,” he\nsaid.\n\n“I talk with a good deal of confidence,” she went on, with a cheerless,\nruminative little laugh, “because it is my own organization that I am\ndescribing, too. The difference is that I was allowed to exploit my\ncapacity for mischief very early. I had my own way in my teens--my own\nmoney, my own power--of course only of a certain sort, and in a very\nsmall place. But I know what I did with that power. I spread trouble\nand misery about me--always of course on a small scale. Then a group of\nthings happened in a kind of climax--a very painful climax--and it\nshook the nonsense out of me. My brother and my father died--some other\nsobering things happened...and luckily I was still young enough to stop\nshort, and take stock of myself, and say that there were certain paths\nI would never set foot on again--and stick to it. But with you--do you\nsee?--power only comes to you when you are a mature man. Experiences, no\nmatter how unpleasant they are, will not change you now. You will not\nbe moved by this occurrence or that to distrust yourself, or reconsider\nyour methods, or form new resolutions. Oh no! Power will be terrible\nin your hands, if people whom you can injure provoke you to cruel\ncourses----”\n\n“Oh, dear--dear!” broke in Lady Cressage. “What a distressing Mrs.\nGummidge-Cassandra you are, Celia! Pray stop it!”\n\n“No--she's right enough,” said Thorpe, gravely. “That's the kind of man\nI am.”\n\nHe seemed so profoundly interested in the contemplation of this portrait\nwhich had been drawn of him, that the others respected his reflective\nsilence. He sat for some moments, idly fingering a fork on the table,\nand staring at a blotch of vivid red projected through a decanter upon\nthe cloth.\n\n“It seems to me that's the only kind of man it's worth while to be,”\n he added at last, still speaking with thoughtful deliberation. “There's\nnothing else in the world so big as power--strength. If you have that,\nyou can get everything else. But if you have it, and don't use it, then\nit rusts and decays on your hands. It's like a thoroughbred horse. You\ncan't keep it idle in the stable. If you don't exercise it, you lose\nit.”\n\nHe appeared to be commenting upon some illustration which had occurred\nto his own mind, but was not visible to his auditors. While they\nregarded him, he was prompted to admit them to his confidence.\n\n“There was a case of it today,” he said, and then paused.\n\n“Precisely,” put in Miss Madden. “The fact that some Frenchwoman, of\nwhom you had never heard before, was going to lose her marriage portion\ncaught your attention, and on the instant you presented her with\n$10,000, an exercise of power which happens to be on the generous\nside--but still entirely unreasoning, and not deserving of any\nintellectual respect. And here's the point: if it had happened that\nsomebody else chanced to produce an opposite impression upon you, you\nwould have been capable of taking $50,000 away from him with just as\nlight a heart.”\n\nThorpe's face beamed with repressed amusement. “As a matter of fact it\nwas that kind of case I was going to mention. I wasn't referring to the\ngirl and her marriage portion. A young man came to me today--came into\nmy room all cock-a-whoop, smiling to himself with the notion that he had\nonly to name what he wanted, and I would give it to him--and----”\n\nHe stopped abruptly, with a confused little laugh. He had been upon the\nbrink of telling about Lord Plowden's discomfiture, and even now the\nstory itched upon his tongue. It cost him an effort to put the narrative\naside, the while he pondered the arguments which had suddenly reared\nthemselves against publicity. When at last he spoke, it was with a\nglance of conscious magnanimity toward the lady who had consented to be\nhis wife.\n\n“Never mind,” he said, lightly. “There wasn't much to it. The man\nannoyed me, somehow--and he didn't get what he came for--that's all.”\n\n“But he was entitled to get it?” asked Celia Madden. Thorpe's lips\npouted over a reply. “Well--no,” he said, with a kind of reluctance.\n“He got strictly what he was entitled to--precisely what I had promised\nhim--and he wrung up his nose at that--and then I actually gave him\n15,000 pounds he wasn't entitled to at all.”\n\n“I hardly see what it proves, then,” Edith Cressage remarked, and the\nsubject was dropped.\n\nSome two hours later, Thorpe took his departure. It was not until he\nwas getting into the hansom which had been summoned, that it all at\nonce occurred to him that he had not for a moment been alone with his\nbetrothed. Upon reflection, as the cab sped smoothly forward, this\nseemed odd to him. He decided finally that there was probably some\nsocial rule about such things which he didn't understand.\n\n*****\n\nIn the drawing-room of the house in Grafton Street which he had quitted,\nthe two ladies sat with faces averted from each other, in constrained\nsilence.\n\nEdith Cressage rose at last, and took a few aimless steps, with her\nhands at her hair. “Well--I'm embarked--fairly under way!” she said, in\nclear-cut, almost provocative tones.\n\n“I don't at all know what to say,” her companion replied, slowly. “I\nfancy that you exaggerate my disapproval. Perhaps it ought not even to\nbe called disapproval at all. It is only that I am puzzled--and a little\nfrightened.”\n\n“Oh, I am frightened too,” said the other, but with eagerness rather\nthan trepidation in her voice. “That is why I did not give you the\nsignal to leave us alone. I couldn't quite get up the nerve for it. But\nwould you believe it?--that is one of the charms of the thing. There\nis an excitement about it that exhilarates me. To get happiness through\nterror--you can't understand that, can you?”\n\n“I'm trying. I think I'm beginning to understand,” said Miss Madden,\nvaguely.\n\n“Did you ever set yourself to comprehending why Marie Stuart married\nBothwell?” asked Edith, looking down upon the other with illuminating\nfixity. “You have it all--all there. Marie got tired of the smooth\npeople, the usual people. There was the promise of adventure, and risk,\nand peril, and the grand emotions with the big, dark brute.”\n\n“It isn't a happy story--this parallel that you pick out,” commented\nCelia, absently.\n\n“Happy! Pah!” retorted Edith, with spirit. “Who knows if it wasn't the\nonly really happy thing in her life? The snobs and prigs all scold\nher and preach sermons at her--they did it in her lifetime: they do it\nnow----” “Oh come, I'm neither a snob nor a prig,” put in Celia, looking\nup in her turn, and tempering with a smile the energy of her tone--“I\ndon't blame her for her Bothwell; I don't criticize her. I never was\neven able to mind about her killing Darnley. You see I take an extremely\nliberal view. One might almost call it broad. But if I had been one of\nher ladies--her bosom friends--say Catherine Seton--and she had\ntalked with me about it--I think I should have confessed to some\nforebodings--some little misgivings.”\n\n“And do you know what she would have said?” Edith's swift question, put\nwith a glowing face and a confident voice, had in it the ring of assured\ntriumph. “She would have answered you: 'My dearest girl, all my life I\nhave done what other people told me to do. In my childhood I was\ngiven in marriage to a criminal idiot. In my premature widowhood I\nwas governed by a committee of scoundrels of both sexes until another\ncriminal idiot was imposed upon me as a second husband. My own\npersonality has never had the gleam of a chance. I have never yet\ndone any single thing because I wanted to do it. Between first my\npolitician-mother and her band of tonsured swindlers, and then my\ncantankerous brother and his crew of snarling and sour-minded preachers,\nand all the court liars and parasites and spies that both sides\nsurrounded me with, I have lived an existence that isn't life at all. I\npurport to be a woman, but I have never been suffered to see a genuine\nman. And now here is one--or what I think to be one--and I'm given to\nunderstand that he is a pirate and a murderer and an unspeakable ruffian\ngenerally--but he takes my fancy, and he has beckoned to me to come to\nhim, and so you will kindly get me my hat and jacket and gloves.' That's\nwhat she would have said to you, my dear.”\n\n“And I”--said Celia, rising after a moment's pause, and putting her hand\nupon Edith's arm--“I would have answered, 'Dearest lady, in whatever\nbefalls, I pray you never to forget that I am to the end your fond and\ndevoted and loyal servant.'”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nAUGUST wore itself out in parched tedium, and a September began which\nseemed even more unbearable in town,--and still Thorpe did not get away\nfrom London.\n\nSo far as the payment of an exorbitant rent in advance, and the receipt\nof innumerable letters from a restless and fussy steward whom he had\nnot yet seen, went as evidence, he knew himself to be the tenant in\npossession of a great shooting in Morayshire. He had several photographs\nof what was called the lodge, but looked like something between a\nmansion and a baronial castle, on the mantel of the Board Room. The\nreflection that this sumptuous residence had been his for a month, and\nthat it daily stood waiting for him, furnished and swept and provisioned\nfor his coming, did nothing to help the passing of time in the hot,\nfagged City. More than once he had said resolutely that, on the morrow,\nor at the worst the next day, he would go--but in the event he had\nnot gone. In the last week of August he had proceeded to the length of\nsending his niece and nephew Northward, and shutting up the house in\nOvington Square, and betaking himself to the Savoy Hotel. This had\nappeared at the time to be almost equivalent to his getting away\nhimself,--to be at least a first stage in the progress of his own\njourney. But at the hotel he had stuck fast,--and now, on the tenth of\nSeptember, was no nearer the moors and the deer-forest than he had been\na month before.\n\nA novel sense of loneliness,--of the fatuity of present\nexistence,--weighed grievously upon him. The ladies of Grafton Street\nhad left town upon a comprehensive itinerary of visits which included\nthe Malvern country, and a ducal castle in Shropshire, and a place in\nWestmoreland. There was nothing very definite about the date of their\ncoming to him in Scotland. The lady who had consented to marry him had,\nsomehow, omitted to promise that she would write to him. An arrangement\nexisted, instead, by which she and his niece Julia were to correspond,\nand to fix between themselves the details of the visit to Morayshire.\n\nThorpe hardly went to the point of annoyance with this arrangement.\nHe was conscious of no deep impulse to write love-letters himself, and\nthere was nothing in the situation which made his failure to receive\nlove-letters seem unnatural. The absence of moonshine, at least during\nthis preliminary season, had been quite taken for granted between them,\nand he did not complain even to himself. There was even a kind of\nproud satisfaction for him in the thought that, though he had all but\ncompleted the purchase of the noble Pellesley estate for Edith Cressage,\nhe had never yet kissed her. The reserve he imposed upon himself gave\nhim a certain aristocratic fineness in his own eyes. It was the means by\nwhich he could feel himself to be most nearly her equal. But he remained\nvery lonely in London, none the less.\n\nIt is true that a great deal of society was continually offered to him,\nand even thrust upon him. In the popular phrase, London was empty,\nbut there seemed to be more people than ever who desired Mr. Stormont\nThorpe' s presence at their dinner-tables, or their little theatre or\ncard or river parties. He clung sullenly to his rule of going\nnowhere, but it was not so simple a matter to evade the civilities and\nimportunities of those who were stopping at the hotel, or who came there\nto waylay him at the entrance, or to encounter him in the restaurant. He\ncould not always refuse to sit down at tables when attractively-dressed\nand vivacious women made room for him, or to linger over cigars and wine\nwith their husbands and escorts later on.\n\nAn incessant and spirited court was paid to him by many different groups\nof interested people who were rarely at the pains to dissemble their\naims. He formed a manner for the reception of these advances, compounded\nof joviality, cynicism, and frank brutality, which nobody, to his face\nat least, resented. If women winced under his mocking rudenesses of\nspeech and smile, if men longed to kill him for the cold insolence of\nhis refusal to let them inside his guard, they sedulously kept it from\nhim. The consciousness that everybody was afraid of him,--that everybody\nwould kneel to him, and meekly take insult and ignominy from him, if\nonly hope remained to them of getting something out of him,--hardened\nlike a crust upon his mind.\n\nIt was impossible to get a sense of companionship from people who\ncringed to him, and swallowed his affronts and cackled at his jokes\nwith equal docility. Sometimes he had a passing amusement in the rough\npleasantries and cruelties which they drew from him. There were two or\nthree bright Jewish women, more gayly clever and impudent, perhaps, than\nbeautiful, with whom he found it genuine fun to talk, and concerning\nwhom he was perpetually conceiving projects which could not have been\ndiscussed with their husbands, and as perpetually doing nothing to\ntest their feasibility. But these diversions were in their essence\nunsubstantial. There was not even the semblance of a real friendship\namong them,--and loneliness became an increasing burden.\n\nHis sister at the old book-shop exasperated him nowadays to a degree\nwhich often provoked within him the resolution to have done with her.\nHe had a score of projects for her betterment, each capable of as many\nvariations and eager adaptations to suit her fancy, but to them all and\nsundry she opposed a barrier of stupidly passive negation. There was\nnothing she wanted done for her. She would not exchange the work she had\nbeen brought up in for a life of idleness. She did not want, and would\nnot know what to do with, a bigger shop than she had. An augmentation of\nher capital would be of no use, because there was no room in the crowded\nlittle shop for a larger stock than it contained. She was entirely\nsatisfied with the dingy home overhead, and declined to think even of\nmoving elsewhere. Over and over again she met his propositions with a\nsaying which he could recall having particularly hated on their father's\nlips,--“It's ill teaching an old dog new tricks.”\n\n“You ought to have them taught you with a stick,” he had told her\nroundly, on the last occasion.\n\nShe had merely shrugged her gaunt shoulders at him. “You think you can\nbully everybody and make them crawl to you,--but there's no good your\ntrying it on with me,” she had told him, and he had pushed his way out\nof the shop almost stamping his feet. It was clear to him at that moment\nthat he would never darken her door again.\n\nYet now, on this afternoon of the tenth, as he lounged with a cigar and\na City paper in his apartment at the hotel after luncheon, wondering\nwhether it were too hot to issue forth for a walk to the Park, the\nirrelevant idea of going round to see his sister kept coming into his\nmind. He seated himself and fastened his attention upon the paper,--but\noff it slipped again to the old book-shop, and to that curious,\ncross-grained figure, its mistress. He abandoned himself to thinking\nabout her--and discovered that a certain unique quality in her\nchallenged his admiration. She was the only absolutely disinterested\nperson he knew--the only creature in the world, apparently, who did not\ndesire to make something out of him. She was not at all well-off,--was\nindeed rather poor than otherwise,--and here was her only brother a\nmillionaire, and in her dumb way she had a sisterly affection for him,\nand yet she could not be argued or cajoled into touching a penny of his\nmoney. Surely there could be no other woman like her.\n\nThorpe realized that it was a distinction to have such a sister,--and\nbehind this thought rose obscurely the suggestion that there must be\nwonderful blood in a race which had produced such a daughter. And for\nthat matter, such a son too! He lifted his head, and looked abstractedly\nbefore him, as if he were gazing at some apotheosis of himself in a\nmirror.\n\nHe beheld all at once something concrete and personal, obtruded into the\nheart of his reverie, the sight of which dimly astounded him. For the\nmoment, with opened lips he stared at it,--then slowly brought himself\nto comprehend what had happened. An old man had by some oversight of\nthe hotel servants been allowed to enter the room unannounced. He had\nwandered in noiselessly, and had moved in a purblind fashion to the\ncentre of the apartment. The vagueness of the expression on his face and\nof his movements hinted at a vacant mind or too much drink,--but Thorpe\ngave no thought to either hypothesis. The face itself--no--yes--it was\nthe face of old Tavender.\n\n“In the name of God! What are you doing here?” Thorpe gasped at this\nextraordinary apparition. Still staring, he began to push back his chair\nand put his weight upon his feet.\n\n“Well--Thorpe”--the other began, thrusting forward his head to look\nthrough his spectacles--“so it is you, after all. I didn't know whether\nI was going to find you or not. This place has got so many turns and\ntwists to it----”\n\n“But good heavens!” interposed the bewildered Thorpe. He had risen to\nhis feet. He mechanically took the hand which the other had extended to\nhim. “What in hell”--he began, and broke off again. The aroma of alcohol\non the air caught his sense, and his mind stopped at the perception that\nTavender was more or less drunk. He strove to spur it forward, to compel\nit to encompass the meanings of this new crisis, but almost in vain.\n\n“Thought I'd look you up,” said the old man, buoyantly. “Nobody in\nLondon I'd rather see than you. How are you, anyway?”\n\n“What did you come over for? When did you get here?” Thorpe put the\nquestions automatically. His self-control was returning to him; his\ncapable brain pushed forward now under something like disciplined\ndirection.\n\n“Why I guess I owe it all to you,” replied Tavender. Traces of the old\nQuaker effect which had been so characteristic of him still hung about\nhis garb and mien, but there shone a new assurance on his benignant,\nrubicund face. Prosperity had visibly liberalized and enheartened him.\nHe shook Thorpe's hand again. “Yes, sir--it must have been all through\nyou!” he repeated. “I got my cable three weeks ago--'Hasten to\nLondon, urgent business, expenses and liberal fee guaranteed, Rubber\nConsols'--that's what the cable said, that is, the first one and of\ncourse you're the man that introduced me to those rubber people. And so\ndon't you see I owe it all to you?”\n\nHis insistence upon his obligation was suddenly almost tearful. Thorpe\nthought hard as he replied: “Oh--that's all right. I'm very glad indeed\nto have helped you along. And so you came over for the Rubber Consols\npeople, eh? Well--that's good. Seen 'em yet? You haven't told me when\nyou landed.”\n\n“Came up from Southampton this morning. My brother-in-law was down\nthere to meet me. We came up to London together.” “Your brother-in-law,”\n observed Thorpe, meditatively. Some shadowy, remote impression of\nhaving forgotten something troubled his mind for an instant. “Is your\nbrother-in-law in the rubber business?”\n\n“Extraor'nary thing,” explained Tavender, beamingly, “he don't know\nno more about the whole affair than the man 'n the moon. I asked him\ntoday--but he couldn't tell me anything about the business--what it was\nI'd been sent for, or anything.”\n\n“But he--he knew you'd been sent for,” Thorpe commented upon brief\nreflection.\n\n“Why, he sent the second cable himself----”\n\n“What second cable?”\n\n“Why it was the next day,--or maybe it was sent that same night, and\nnot delivered till morning,--I got another cable, this time from my\nbrother-in-law, telling me to cable him what ship I sailed on and when.\nSo of course he knew all about it--but now he says he don't. He's a\ncurious sort of fellow, anyway.”\n\n“But how is he mixed up in it?” demanded Thorpe, impatiently.\n\n“Well, as nearly as I can figure it out, he works for one of the men\nthat's at the head of this rubber company. It appears that he happened\nto show this man--he's a man of title, by the way--a letter I wrote to\nhim last spring, when I got back to Mexico--and so in that way this man,\nwhen he wanted me to come over, just told Gafferson to cable to me.”\n\n“Gafferson,” Thorpe repeated, very slowly, and with almost an effect\nof listlessness. He was conscious of no surprise; it was as if he\nhad divined all along the sinister shadows of Lord Plowden and Lord\nPlowden's gardener, lurking in the obscurity behind this egregious old\nass of a Tavender.\n\n“He's a tremendous horticultural sharp,” said the other. “Probably\nyou've heard tell of him. He's taken medals for new flowers and things\ntill you can't rest. He's over at--what do you call it?--the Royal\nAquarium, now, to see the Dahlia Show. I went over there with him, but\nit didn't seem to be my kind of a show, and so I left him there, and\nI'm to look in again for him at 5:30. I'm going down to his place in the\ncountry with him tonight, to meet his boss--the nobleman I spoke of.”\n\n“That's nice,” Thorpe commented, slowly. “I envy anybody who can get\ninto the country these days. But how did you know I was here?” “The\nwoman in the book-store told me--I went there the first thing. You might\nbe sure I'd look you up. Nobody was ever a better friend than you've\nbeen to me, Thorpe. And do you know what I want you to do? I want you to\ncome right bang out, now, and have a drink with me.”\n\n“I was thinking of something of the sort myself,” the big man replied.\n“I'll get my hat, and be with you in a minute.”\n\nIn the next room he relinquished his countenance to a frown of fierce\nperplexity. More than a minute passed in this scowling preoccupation.\nThen his face lightened with the relief of an idea, and he stepped\nconfidently back into the parlour.\n\n“Come along,” he said, jovially. “We'll have a drink downstairs, and\nthen we'll drive up to Hanover Square and see if we can't find a friend\nof mine at his club.”\n\nIn the office below he stopped long enough to secure a considerable\nroll of bank-notes in exchange for a cheque. A little later, a hansom\ndeposited the couple at the door of the Asian Club, and Thorpe, in the\nouter hallway of this institution, clicked his teeth in satisfaction at\nthe news that General Kervick was on the premises.\n\nThe General, having been found by a boy and brought down, extended\nto his guests a hospitality which was none the less urbane for the\nevidences of surprise with which it was seasoned. He concealed so\nindifferently his inability to account for Tavender, that the anxious\nThorpe grew annoyed with him, but happily Tavender's perceptions were\nless subtle. He gazed about him in his dim-eyed way with childlike\ninterest, and babbled cheerfully over his liquor. He had not been\ninside a London club before, and his glimpse of the reading-room, where,\nisolated, purple-faced, retired old Empire-makers sat snorting in the\nsilence, their gouty feet propped up on foot-rests, their white brows\nscowling over the pages of French novels, particularly impressed him. It\nwas a new and halcyon vision of the way to spend one's declining years.\nAnd the big smoking-room--where the leather cushions were so low and\nso soft, and the connection between the bells and the waiters was so\nefficient--that was even better.\n\nThorpe presently made an excuse for taking Kervick apart. “I brought\nthis old jackass here for a purpose,” he said in low, gravely mandatory\ntones. “He thinks he's got an appointment at 5:30 this afternoon--but\nhe's wrong. He hasn't. He's not going to have any appointment at\nall--for a long time yet. I want you to get him drunk, there where he\nsits, and then take him away with you, and get him drunker still, and\nthen take a train with him somewhere--any station but Charing Cross or\nthat line--and I don't care where you land with him--Scotland or Ireland\nor France--whatever you like. Here's some money for you--and you can\nwrite to me for more. I don't care what you say to him--make up any yarn\nyou like--only keep him pacified, and keep him away from London, and\ndon't let a living soul talk to him--till I give you the word. You'll\nlet me know where you are. I'll get away now--and mind, General, a good\ndeal depends on the way you please me in this thing.”\n\nThe soldier's richly-florid face and intent, bulging blue eyes expressed\nvivid comprehension. He nodded with eloquence as he slipped the notes\ninto his trousers pocket. “Absolutely,” he murmured with martial\nbrevity, from under his white, tight moustache.\n\nWith only a vague word or two of meaningless explanation to Tavender,\nThorpe took his departure, and walked back to the hotel. From what he\nhad learned and surmised, it was not difficult to put the pieces of\nthe puzzle together. This ridiculous old fool, he remembered now, had\nreproached himself, when he was in England before, for his uncivil\nneglect of his brother-in-law. By some absurd chance, this damned\nbrother-in-law happened to be Gafferson. It was clear enough that, when\nhe returned to Mexico, Tavender had written to Gafferson, explaining\nthe unexpected pressure of business which had taken up all his time in\nEngland. Probably he had been idiot enough to relate what he of course\nregarded as the most wonderful piece of good news--how the worthless\nconcession he had been deluded into buying had been bought back from\nhim. As likely as not he had even identified the concession, and given\nThorpe's name as that of the man who had first impoverished and then\nmysteriously enriched him. At all events, he had clearly mentioned that\nhe had a commission to report upon the Rubber Consols property, and\nhad said enough else to create the impression that there were criminal\nsecrets connected with its sale to the London Company. The rest was\neasy. Gafferson, knowing Lord Plowden's relation to the Company, had\nshown him Tavender's letter. Lord Plowden, meditating upon it, had seen\na way to be nasty--and had vindictively plunged into it. He had brought\nTavender from Mexico to London, to use him as a weapon. All this was as\nobvious as the nose on one's face.\n\nBut a weapon for what? Thorpe, as this question put itself in his mind,\nhalted before a shop-window full of soft-hued silk fabrics, to muse upon\nan answer. The delicate tints and surfaces of what was before his eyes\nseemed somehow to connect themselves with the subject. Plowden himself\nwas delicately-tinted and refined of texture. Vindictiveness was too\nplain and coarse an emotion to sway such a complicated and polished\norganism. He reasoned it out, as he stood with lack-lustre gaze before\nthe plate-glass front, aloof among a throng of eager and talkative women\nwho pressed around him--that Plowden would not have spent his money on\na mere impulse of mischief-making. He would be counting upon something\nmore tangible than revenge--something that could be counted and weighed\nand converted into a bank-balance. He smiled when he reached this\nconclusion--greatly surprising and confusing a matronly lady into\nwhose correct face he chanced to be looking at the instant--and turning\nslowly, continued his walk.\n\nAt the office of the hotel, he much regretted not having driven instead,\nfor he learned that Semple had twice telephoned from the City for him.\nIt was late in the afternoon--he noted with satisfaction that the\nclock showed it to be already past the hour of the Tavender-Gafferson\nappointment,--but he had Semple's office called up, upon the chance that\nsomeone might be there. The clerk had not consumed more than ten minutes\nin the preliminaries of finding out that no one was there--Thorpe\nmeanwhile passing savage comments to the other clerks about the British\nofficial conception of the telephone as an instrument of discipline and\nhumiliation--when Semple himself appeared in the doorway.\n\nThe Broker gave an exclamation of relief at seeing Thorpe, and then,\napparently indifferent to the display of excitement he was exhibiting,\ndrew him aside.\n\n“Come somewhere where we can talk,” he whispered nervously.\n\nThorpe had never seen the little Scotchman in such a flurry. “We'll go\nup to my rooms,” he said, and led the way to the lift.\n\nUpstairs, Semple bolted the door of the sitting-room behind them, and\nsatisfied himself that there was no one in the adjoining bedroom. Then,\nunburdening himself with another sigh, he tossed aside his hat, and\nlooked keenly up at the big man. “There's the devil to pay,” he said\nbriefly.\n\nThorpe had a fleeting pride in the lethargic, composed front he was able\nto present. “All right,” he said with forced placidity. “If he's got to\nbe paid, we'll pay him.” He continued to smile a little.\n\n“It's nah joke,” the other hastened to warn him. “I have it from two\ndifferent quarters. An application has been made to the Stock Exchange\nCommittee, this afternoon, to intervene and stop our business, on the\nground of fraud. It comes verra straight to me.”\n\nThorpe regarded his Broker contemplatively. The news fitted with\nprecision into what he had previously known; it was rendered altogether\nharmless by the precautions he had already taken. “Well, keep your hair\non,” he said, quietly. “If there were fifty applications, they wouldn't\nmatter the worth of that soda-water cork. Won't you have a drink?”\n\nSemple, upon reflection, said he would. The unmoved equipoise of the big\nman visibly reassured him. He sipped at his bubbling tumbler and smacked\nhis thin lips. “Man, I've had an awful fright,” he said at last, in the\ntone of one whose ease of mind is returning.\n\n“I gave you credit for more nerve,” observed the other, eyeing him in\nnot unkindly fashion over his glass. “You've been so plumb full of sand\nall the while--I didn't think you'd weaken now. Why, we're within two\ndays of home, now--and for you to get rattled at this late hour--you\nought to be ashamed of yourself.”\n\nThe Scotchman looked into the bottom of his glass, as he turned it\nthoughtfully round. “I'm relieved to see the way you take it,” he said,\nafter a pause. With increased hesitation he went dryly on: “I've never\nenquired minutely into the circumstances of the flotation. It has not\nseemed to be my business to do so, and upon advice I may say that the\nCommittee would not hold that such was my business. My position is quite\nclear, upon that point.”\n\n“Oh, perfectly,” Thorpe assented. “It couldn't possibly be any of your\nbusiness--either then, or now.” He gave a significant touch of emphasis\nto these last two words.\n\n“Precisely,” said Semple, with a glance of swift comprehension. “You\nmust not think I am asking any intrusive questions. If you tell me\nthat--that there is no ground for uneasiness--I am verra pleased indeed\nto accept the assurance. That is ample information for my purposes.”\n\n“You can take it from me,” Thorpe told him. He picked up a red book from\na side table, and turned over its pages with his thick thumb. “This\nis what Rule 59 says,” he went on: “'NO APPLICATION WHICH HAS FOR ITS\nOBJECT TO ANNUL ANY BARGAIN IN THE STOCK EXCHANGE SHALL BE ENTERTAINED\nBY THE COMMITTEE, UNLESS UPON A SPECIFIC ALLEGATION OF FRAUD OR WILFUL\nMISREPRESENTATION.' Shall be entertained, d'ye see? They can't even\nconsider anything of the sort, because it says 'specific,' and I tell\nyou plainly that anything 'specific' is entirely out of the question.”\n\nThe Broker lifted his sandy brows in momentary apprehension. “If it\nturns upon the precise definition of a word,” he remarked, doubtingly.\n\n“Ah, yes,--but it doesn't,” Thorpe reassured him. “See here--I'll tell\nyou something. You're not asking any questions. That's as it should be.\nAnd I'm not forcing information upon you which you don't need in your\nbusiness. That's as it should be, too. But in between these two, there's\na certain margin of facts that there's no harm in your knowing. A scheme\nto blackmail me is on foot. It's rather a fool-scheme, if you ask me,\nbut it might have been a nuisance if it had been sprung on us unawares.\nIt happened, however, that I twigged this scheme about two hours ago. It\nwas the damnedest bit of luck you ever heard of----”\n\n“You don't have luck,” put in Semple, appreciatively. “Other men have\nluck. You have something else--I don't give it a name.”\n\nThorpe smiled upon him, and went on. “I twigged it, anyway. I went out,\nand I drove the biggest kind of spike through that fool-scheme--plumb\nthrough its heart. Tomorrow a certain man will come to me--oh, I could\nalmost tell you the kind of neck-tie he'll wear--and he'll put up his\nbluff to me, and I'll hear him out--and then--then I'll let the floor\ndrop out from under him.”\n\n“Aye!” said Semple, with relish.\n\n“Stay and dine with me tonight,” Thorpe impulsively suggested, “and\nwe'll go to some Music Hall afterward. There's a knock-about pantomime\noutfit at the Canterbury--Martinetti I think the name is--that's damned\ngood. You get plenty of laugh, and no tiresome blab to listen to. The\nolder I get, the more I think of people that keep their mouths shut.”\n\n“Aye,” observed Semple again.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nIN the Board Room, next day, Thorpe awaited the coming of Lord Plowden\nwith the serene confidence of a prophet who not only knows that he\nis inspired, but has had an illicit glimpse into the workings of the\nmachinery of events.\n\nHe sat motionless at his desk, like a big spider for who time has\nno meaning. Before him lay two newspapers, folded so as to expose\nparagraphs heavily indicated by blue pencil-marks. They were not\nfinancial journals, and for that reason it was improbable that he would\nhave seen these paragraphs, if the Secretary of the Company had not\nmarked them, and brought them to him. That official had been vastly more\nfluttered by them than he found it possible to be. In slightly-varying\nlanguage, these two items embedded in so-called money articles reported\nthe rumour that a charge of fraud had arisen in connection with the\nRubber Consols corner, and that sensational disclosures were believed to\nbe impending.\n\nThorpe looked with a dulled, abstracted eye at these papers, lying\non the desk, and especially at the blue pencil-lines upon them, as he\npondered many things. Their statement, thus scattered broadcast to the\npublic, seemed at once to introduce a new element into the situation,\nand to leave it unchanged. That influence of some sort had been exerted\nto get this story into these papers, it did not occur to him for an\ninstant to doubt. To his view, all things that were put into papers\nwere put there for a purpose--it would express his notion more clearly,\nperhaps, to say for a price. Of the methods of Fleet Street, he was\nprofoundly ignorant, but his impressions of them were all cynical. Upon\nreflection, however, it seemed unlikely to him that Lord Plowden had\nsecured the insertion of these rumours. So far as Thorpe could fathom\nthat nobleman's game, its aims would not be served by premature\npublicity of this kind.\n\nGradually, the outlines of a more probable combination took shape in\nhis thoughts. There were left in the grip of the “corner” now only\ntwo victims,--Rostocker and Aronson. They owed this invidious\ndifferentiation to a number of causes: they had been the chief sellers\nof stock, being between them responsible for the delivery of 8,500\nRubber Consols shares, which they could not get; they were men of larger\nfortune than the other “shorts,” and therefore could with safety be\nsqueezed longest; what was fortunate for him under the circumstances,\nthey were the two men against whom Thorpe's personal grudge seemed able\nto maintain itself most easily.\n\nFor these reasons, they had already been mulcted in differences to the\nextent of, in round numbers, 165,000 pounds. On the morrow, the twelfth\nof September, it was Thorpe's plan to allow them to buy in the shares\nthey needed, at 22 or 23 pounds per share--which would take from them\nnearly 200,000 pounds more. He had satisfied himself that they could,\nand would if necessary, pay this enormous ransom for their final escape\nfrom the “corner.” Partly because it was not so certain that they could\npay more, partly because he was satiated with spoils and tired of the\nstrain of the business, he had decided to permit this escape.\n\nHe realized now, however, that they on their side had planned to escape\nwithout paying any final ransom at all.\n\nThat was clearly the meaning of these paragraphs, and of the\nrepresentations which had yesterday been made to the Stock Exchange\nCommittee. He had additional knowledge today of the character of these\nrepresentations. Nothing definite had been alleged, but some of the\nmembers of the Committee had been informally notified, so Semple had\nthis morning learned, that a specific charge of fraud, supported\nby unanswerable proof, was to be brought against the Rubber Consols\nmanagement on the morrow. Thorpe reasoned out now, step by step, what\nthat meant. Lord Plowden had sought out Rostocker and Aronson, and\nhad told them that he had it in his power ignominiously to break the\n“corner.” He could hardly have told them the exact nature of his power,\nbecause until he should have seen Tavender he did not himself know what\nit was. But he had given them to understand that he could prove fraud,\nand they, scenting in this the chance of saving 200,000 pounds, and\nseeing that time was so terribly short, had hastened to the Committeemen\nwith this vague declaration that, on the morrow, they could prove--they\ndid not precisely know what. Yes--plainly enough--that was what had\nhappened. And it would be these two Jew “wreckers,” eager to invest\ntheir speculative notification to the Committee with as much of an\nair of formality as possible, who had caused the allusions to it to be\npublished in these papers.\n\nThorpe's lustreless eye suddenly twinkled with mirth as he reached this\nconclusion; his heavy face brightened into a grin of delight. A vision\nof Lord Plowden's absurd predicament rose vividly before him, and he\nchuckled aloud at it.\n\nIt seemed only the most natural thing in the world that, at this\ninstant, a clerk should open the door and nod with meaning to the\nmaster. The visitor whom he had warned the people in the outer office\nhe expected, had arrived. Thorpe was still laughing to himself when Lord\nPlowden entered.\n\n“Hallo! How d'ye do!” he called out to him from where he sat at his\ndesk.\n\nThe hilarity of the manner into which he had been betrayed, upon the\ninstant surprised and rather confused him. He had not been altogether\nclear as to how he should receive Plowden, but certainly a warm\njoviality had not occurred to him as appropriate.\n\nThe nobleman was even more taken aback. He stared momentarily at the\nbig man's beaming mask, and then, with nervous awkwardness, executed a\nseries of changes in his own facial expression and demeanour. He flushed\nred, opened his lips to say “Ah!” and then twisted them into a doubting\nand seemingly painful smile. He looked with very bright-eyed intentness\nat Thorpe, as he advanced, and somewhat spasmodically put out his hand.\n\nIt occurred to Thorpe not to see this hand. “How are you!” he repeated\nin a more mechanical voice, and withdrew his smile. Lord Plowden\nfidgeted on his feet for a brief, embarrassed interval before the desk,\nand then dropped into a chair at its side. With a deliberate effort at\nnonchalance, he crossed his legs, and caressed the ankle on his knee\nwith a careless hand. “Anything new?” he asked.\n\nThorpe lolled back in his arm-chair. “I'm going to be able to get away\nin a few days' time,” he said, indifferently. “I expect to finally wind\nup the business on the Stock Exchange tomorrow.”\n\n“Ah--yes,” commented Plowden, vacantly. He seemed to be searching after\nthoughts which had wandered astray. “Yes--of course.”\n\n“Yes--of course,” Thorpe said after him, with a latent touch of\nsignificance.\n\nThe other looked up quickly, then glanced away again. “It's all going as\nyou expected, is it?” he asked.\n\n“Better than I expected,” Thorpe told him, energetically. “Much better\nthan anybody expected.”\n\n“Hah!” said Plowden. After a moment's reflection he went on\nhesitatingly: “I didn't know. I saw something in one of the papers this\nmorning,--one of the money articles,--which spoke as if there were some\ndoubt about the result. That's why I called.”\n\n“Well--it's damned good of you to come round, and show such a friendly\ninterest.” Thorpe's voice seemed candid enough, but there was an\nenigmatic something in his glance which aroused the other's distrust.\n\n“I'm afraid you don't take very much stock in the 'friendly interest,'”\n he said, with a constrained little laugh.\n\n“I'm not taking stock in anything new just now,” replied Thorpe, lending\nhimself lazily to the other's metaphor. “I'm loaded up to the gunnels\nalready.”\n\nA minute of rather oppressive silence ensued. Then Plowden ventured upon\nan opening. “All the same, it WAS with an idea of,--perhaps being of use\nto you,--that I came here,” he affirmed. “In what way?” Thorpe put the\nquery almost listlessly.\n\nLord Plowden turned his hands and let his dark eyes sparkle in a gesture\nof amiable uncertainty. “That depended upon what was needed. I got the\nimpression that you were in trouble--the paper spoke as if there were\nno doubt of it--and I imagined that quite probably you would be glad to\ntalk with me about it.”\n\n“Quite right,” said Thorpe. “So I should.”\n\nThis comprehensive assurance seemed not, however, to facilitate\nconversation. The nobleman looked at the pattern of the sock on the\nankle he was nursing, and knitted his brows in perplexity. “What if the\nCommittee of the Stock Exchange decide to interfere?” he asked at last.\n\n“Oh, that would knock me sky-high,” Thorpe admitted.\n\n“Approximately, how much may one take 'sky-high' to mean?”\n\nThorpe appeared to calculate. “Almost anything up to a quarter of a\nmillion,” he answered.\n\n“Hah!” said Lord Plowden again. “Well--I understand--I'm given to\nunderstand--that very likely that is what the Committee will decide.”\n\n“Does it say that in the papers?” asked Thorpe. He essayed an effect of\nconcern. “Where did you see that?”\n\n“I didn't see it,” the other explained. “It--it came to me.”\n\n“God!” said Thorpe. “That'll be awful! But are you really in earnest? Is\nthat what you hear? And does it come at all straight?”\n\nLord Plowden nodded portentously. “Absolutely straight,” he said, with\ngravity.\n\nThorpe, after a momentary stare of what looked like bewilderment,\nwas seen to clutch at a straw. “But what was it you were saying?” he\ndemanded, with eagerness. “You talked about help--a minute ago. Did you\nmean it? Have you got a plan? Is there something that you can do?”\n\nPlowden weighed his words. “It would be necessary to have a very\ncomplete understanding,” he remarked.\n\n“Whatever you like,” exclaimed the other.\n\n“Pardon me--it would have to be a good deal more definite than that,”\n Plowden declared. “A 'burnt child'--you know.”\n\nThe big man tapped musingly with his finger-nails on the desk. “We won't\nquarrel about that,” he said. “But what I'd like to know first,--you\nneedn't give anything away that you don't want to,--but what's your\nplan? You say that they've got me in a hole, and that you can get me\nout.” “In effect--yes.”\n\n“But how do you know that I can't get myself out? What do you know about\nthe whole thing anyway? Supposing I tell you that I laugh at it--that\nthere's no more ground for raising the suspicion of fraud than there is\nfor--for suspecting that you've got wings and can fly.”\n\n“I--I don't think you'll tell me that,” said Plowden, placidly.\n\n“Well then, supposing I don't tell you that,” the other resumed,\nargumentatively. “Supposing I say instead that it can't be proved. If\nthe Committee doesn't have proof NOW,--within twenty-one or twenty-two\nhours,--they can't do anything at all. Tomorrow is settling day. All\nalong, I've said I would wind up the thing tomorrow. The market-price\nhas been made for me by the jobbers yesterday and today. I'm all ready\nto end the whole business tomorrow--close it all out. And after that's\ndone, what do I care about the Stock Exchange Committee? They can\ninvestigate and be damned! What could they do to me?”\n\n“I think a man can always be arrested and indicted, and sent to penal\nservitude,” said Lord Plowden, with a certain solemnity of tone. “There\nare even well-known instances of extradition.”\n\nThorpe buried his chin deep in his collar, and regarded his companion\nwith a fixed gaze, in which the latter detected signs of trepidation.\n“But about the Committee--and tomorrow,” he said slowly. “What do you\nsay about that? How can they act in that lightning fashion? And even if\nproofs could be got, how do you suppose they are to be got on the drop\nof the hat, at a minute's notice?”\n\n“The case is of sufficient importance to warrant a special meeting\ntomorrow morning,” the other rejoined. “One hour's notice, posted in the\nHouse, is sufficient, I believe. Any three members of the Committee can\ncall such a meeting, and I understand that seven make a quorum. You will\nsee that a meeting could be held at noon tomorrow, and within half an\nhour could make you a ruined man.”\n\n“I don't know--would you call it quite ruined?” commented Thorpe. “I\nshould still have a few sovereigns to go on with.”\n\n“A criminal prosecution would be practically inevitable--after such a\ndisclosure,” Plowden reminded him, with augmented severity of tone.\n\n“Don't mix the two things up,” the other urged. There seemed to the\nlistener to be supplication in the voice. “It's the action of the\nCommittee that you said you could influence. That's what we were talking\nabout. You say there will be a special meeting at noon tomorrow----\n\n“I said there could be one,” Plowden corrected him.\n\n“All right. There CAN be one. And do you say that there can be\nproof,--proof against me of fraud,--produced at that meeting?”\n\n“Yes--I say that,” the nobleman affirmed, quietly.\n\n“And further still--do you say that it rests with you whether that proof\nshall be produced or not?”\n\nLord Plowden looked into the impassive, deep-eyed gaze which covered\nhim, and looked away from it again. “I haven't put it in just that\nform,” he said, hesitatingly. “But in essentials--yes, that may be taken\nas true.”\n\n“And what is your figure? How much do you want for holding this proof\nof yours back, and letting me finish scooping the money of your Hebrew\nfriends Aronson and Rostocker?”\n\nThe peer raised his head, and shot a keenly enquiring glance at the\nother. “Are they my friends?” he asked, with challenging insolence.\n\n“I'm bound to assume that you have been dealing with them, just as you\nare dealing with me.” Thorpe explained his meaning dispassionately, as\nif the transaction were entirely commonplace. “You tell them that you're\nin a position to produce proof against me, and ask them what they'll\ngive for it. Then naturally enough you come to me, and ask what I'll be\nwilling to pay to have the proof suppressed. I quite understand that I\nmust bid against these men--and of course I take it for granted that,\nsince you know their figure, you've arranged in your mind what mine is\nto be. I quite understand, too, that I am to pay more than they have\noffered. That is on account of 'friendly interest.'”\n\n“Since you allude to it,” Lord Plowden observed, with a certain calm\nloftiness of tone, “there is no harm in saying that you WILL pay\nsomething on that old score. Once you thrust the promise of something\nlike a hundred thousand pounds positively upon me. You insisted on my\nbelieving it, and I did so, like a fool. I came to you to redeem the\npromise, and you laughed in my face. Very well. It is my turn now. I\nhold the whip-hand, and I should be an ass not to remember things. I\nshall want that entire one hundred thousand pounds from you, and fifty\nthousand added to it 'on account of the 'friendly interest,' as you so\nintelligently expressed it.”\n\nThorpe's chin burrowed still deeper upon his breast. “It's an outrage,”\n he said with feeling. Then he added, in tones of dejected resignation:\n“When will you want it?”\n\n“At the moment when the payments of Rostocker and Aronson are made to\nyou, or to your bankers or agents,” Lord Plowden replied, with prepared\nfacility. He had evidently given much thought to this part of the\nproceedings. “And of course I shall expect you to draw up now an\nagreement to that effect. I happen to have a stamped paper with me this\ntime. And if you don't mind, we will have it properly witnessed--this\ntime.”\n\nThorpe looked at him with a disconcertingly leaden stare, the while he\nthought over what had been proposed. “That's right enough,” he announced\nat last, “but I shall expect you to do some writing too. Since we're\ndealing on this basis, there must be no doubt about the guarantee that\nyou will perform your part of the contract.”\n\n“The performance itself, since payment is conditional upon it--” began\nPlowden, but the other interrupted him.\n\n“No, I want something better than that. Here--give me your stamped\npaper.” He took the bluish sheet, and, without hesitation, wrote several\nlines rapidly. “Here--this is my promise,” he said, “to pay you 150,000\npounds, upon your satisfactory performance of a certain undertaking to\nbe separately nominated in a document called 'A,' which we will jointly\ndraw up and agree to and sign, and deposit wherever you like--for\nsafe keeping. Now, if you'll sit here, and write out for me a similar\nthing--that in consideration of my promise of 150,000 pounds, you\ncovenant to perform the undertaking to be nominated in the document\n'A'--and so on.”\n\nLord Plowden treated as a matter of course the ready and business-like\nsuggestion of the other. Taking his place at the desk in turn, he wrote\nout what had been suggested. Thorpe touched a bell, and the clerk who\ncame in perfunctorily attested the signatures upon both papers. Each\nprincipal folded and pocketed the pledge of the other.\n\n“Now,” said Thorpe, when he had seated himself again at the desk, “we\nare all right so far as protection against each other goes. If you don't\nmind, I will draw up a suggestion of what the separate document 'A'\nshould set forth. If you don't like it, you can write one.”\n\nHe took more time to this task, frowning laboriously over the fresh\nsheet of foolscap, and screening from observation with his hand what he\nwas writing. Finally, the task seemed finished to his mind. He took up\nthe paper, glanced through it once more, and handed it in silence to the\nother.\n\nIn silence also, and with an expression of arrested attention, Lord\nPlowden read these lines:\n\n“The undertaking referred to in the two documents of even date, signed\nrespectively by Lord Plowden and Stormont Thorpe, is to the effect\nthat at some hour between eleven A.M. and three P.M. of September 12th,\ninstant, Lord Plowden shall produce before a special meeting of the\nCommittee of the Stock Exchange, the person of one Jerome P. Tavender,\nto explain to said Committee his share in the blackmailing scheme of\nwhich Lord Plowden, over his own signature, has furnished documentary\nevidence.”\n\nThe nobleman continued to look down at the paper, after the power to\nhold it without shaking had left his hand. There came into his face,\nmingling with and vitiating its rich natural hues of health, a kind of\ngrey shadow. It was as if clay was revealing itself beneath faded paint.\nHe did not lift his eyes.\n\nThorpe had been prepared to hail this consummation of his trick with\nboisterous and scornful mirth. Even while the victim was deciphering the\nfatal paper, he had restrained with impatience the desire to burst\nout into bitter laughter. But now there was something in the aspect of\nPlowden's collapse which seemed to forbid triumphant derision. He was\ntaking his blow so like a gentleman,--ashen-pale and quivering, but\nclinging to a high-bred dignity of silence,--that the impulse to exhibit\nequally good manners possessed Thorpe upon the instant.\n\n“Well--you see how little business you've got, setting yourself to buck\nagainst a grown-up man.”\n\nHe offered the observation in the tone of the school-teacher, affectedly\nphilosophical but secretly jubilant, who harangues a defeated and\nhumiliated urchin upon his folly.\n\n“Oh, chuck it!” growled Lord Plowden, staring still at the calamitous\npaper.\n\nThorpe accepted in good part the intimation that silence was after all\nmost decorous. He put his feet up on the corner of the desk, and tipping\nback his chair, surveyed the discomfited Viscount impassively. He\nforbore even to smile.\n\n“So this swine of a Tavender came straight to you!” Lord Plowden had\nfound words at last. As he spoke, he lifted his face, and made a show of\nlooking the other in the eye.\n\n“Oh, there are a hundred things in your own game, even, that you haven't\nan inkling of,” Thorpe told him, lightly. “I've been watching every move\nyou've made, seeing further ahead in your own game than you did. Why, it\nwas too easy! It was like playing draughts with a girl. I knew you would\ncome today, for example. I told the people out there that I expected\nyou.”\n\n“Yes-s,” said the other, with rueful bewilderment. “You seem to have\nbeen rather on the spot--I confess.”\n\n“On the spot? All over the place!” Thorpe lifted himself slightly in his\nchair, and put more animation into his voice.\n\n“It's the mistake you people make!” he declared oracularly. “You think\nthat a man can come into the City without a penny, and form great\ncombinations and carry through a great scheme, and wage a fight with the\nsmartest set of scoundrels on the London Stock Exchange and beat 'em,\nand make for himself a big fortune--and still be a fool! You imagine\nthat a man like that can be played with, and hoodwinked by amateurs like\nyourself. It's too ridiculous!”\n\nThe perception that apparently Thorpe bore little or no malice had begun\nto spread through Plowden's consciousness. It was almost more surprising\nto him than the revelation of his failure had been. He accustomed\nhimself to the thought gradually, and as he did so the courage crept\nback into his glance. He breathed more easily.\n\n“You are right!” he admitted. It cost him nothing to give a maximum of\nfervid conviction to the tone of his words. The big brute's pride in his\nown brains and power was still his weakest point. “You are right! I did\nplay the fool. And it was all the more stupid, because I was the first\nman in London to recognize the immense forces in you. I said to you at\nthe very outset, 'You are going to go far. You are going to be a great\nman.' You remember that, don't you?”\n\nThorpe nodded. “Yes--I remember it.”\n\nThe nobleman, upon reflection, drew a little silver box from his pocket,\nand extracted a match. “Do you mind?” he asked, and scarcely waiting for\na token of reply, struck a flame upon the sole of his shoe, and applied\nit to the sheet of foolscap he still held in his hand. The two men\nwatched it curl and blacken after it had been tossed in the grate,\nwithout a word.\n\nThis incident had the effect of recalling to Thorpe the essentials of\nthe situation. He had allowed the talk to drift to a point where it\nbecame almost affable. He sat upright with a sudden determination, and\nput his feet firmly on the floor, and knitted his brows in austerity.\n\n“It was not only a dirty trick that you tried to play me,” he said, in\nan altered, harsh tone, “but it was a fool-trick. That drunken old bum\nof a Tavender writes some lunatic nonsense or other to Gafferson, and\nhe's a worse idiot even than Tavender is, and on the strength of what\none of these clowns thinks he surmises the other clown means, you go and\nspend your money,--money I gave you, by the way,--in bringing Tavender\nover here. You do this on the double chance, we'll say, of using him\nagainst me for revenge and profit combined, or of peddling him to me for\na still bigger profit. You see it's all at my fingers' ends.”\n\nLord Plowden nodded an unqualified assent.\n\n“Well then--Tavender arrives. What do you do? Are you at the wharf to\nmeet him? Have you said to yourself: 'I've set out to fight one of the\nsmartest and strongest men in England, and I've got to keep every atom\nof wits about me, and strain every nerve to the utmost, and watch every\npoint of the game as a tiger watches a snake'? Not a bit of it! You\nsnooze in bed, and you send Gafferson--Gafferson!--the mud-head of the\nearth! to meet your Tavender, and loaf about with him in London, and\nbring him down by a slow train to your place in the evening. My God!\nYou've only got two clear days left to do the whole thing in--and\nyou don't even come up to town to get ready for them! You send\nGafferson--and he goes off to see a flower-show--Mother of Moses! think\nof it! a FLOWER-show!--and your Tavender aud I are left to take a stroll\ntogether, and talk over old times and arrange about new times, and so\non, to our hearts' content. Really, it's too easy! You make me tired!”\n\nThe nobleman offered a wan, appealing shadow of a smile. “I confess to a\ncertain degree of weariness myself,” he said, humbly.\n\nThorpe looked at him in his old apathetic, leaden fashion for a little.\n“I may tell you that if you HAD got hold of Tavender,” he decided to\ntell him, “he shouldn't have been of the faintest use to you. I know\nwhat it was that he wrote to Gafferson,--I couldn't understand it when\nhe first told me, but afterwards I saw through it,--and it was merely a\nmaudlin misapprehension of his. He'd got three or four things all mixed\nup together. You've never met your friend Tavender, I believe? You'd\nenjoy him at Hadlow House. He smells of rum a hundred yards off. What\nlittle brain he's got left is soaked in it. The first time I was ever\ncamping with him, I had to lick him for drinking the methylated spirits\nwe were using with our tin stove. Oh, you'd have liked him!”\n\n“Evidently,” said Lord Plowden, upon reflection, “it was all a most\nunfortunate and--ah--most deplorable mistake.” With inspiration, he made\nbold to add: “The most amazing thing, though--to my mind--is that you\ndon't seem--what shall I say?--particularly enraged with me about it.”\n\n“Yes--that surprises me, too,” Thorpe meditatively admitted. “I was\nentitled to kill you--crush you to jelly. Any other man I would. But\nyou,--I don't know,--I do funny things with you.”\n\n“I wish you would give me a drink, now--as one of them,” Plowden\nventured to suggest, with uneasy pleasantry.\n\nThorpe smiled a little as he rose, and heavily moved across the room.\nHe set out upon the big official table in the middle, that mockingly\npretentious reminder of a Board which never met, a decanter and two\nglasses and some recumbent, round-bottomed bottles. He handed one of\nthese last to Plowden, as the latter strolled toward the table.\n\n“You know how to open these, don't you?” he said, languidly. “Somehow I\nnever could manage it.”\n\nThe nobleman submissively took the bottle, and picked with awkwardness\nat its wire and cork, and all at once achieved a premature and not\nover-successful explosion. He wiped his dripping cuff in silence, when\nthe tumblers were supplied.\n\n“Well--here's better luck to you next time,” Thorpe said, lifting his\nglass. The audacious irony of his words filled Plowden with an instant\npurpose.\n\n“What on earth did you round on me in that way for, Thorpe--when I was\nhere last?” He put the question with bravery enough, but at sight of the\nother's unresponsive face grew suddenly timorous aud explanatory. “No\nman was ever more astounded in the world than I was. To this day I'm as\nunable to account for it as a babe unborn. What conceivable thing had I\ndone to you?”\n\nThorpe slowly thought of something that had not occurred to him before,\nand seized upon it with a certain satisfaction.\n\n“That day that you took me shooting,” he said, with the tone of one\nfinally exposing a long-nursed grievance, “you stayed in bed for hours\nafter you knew I was up and waiting for you--and when we went out, you\nhad a servant to carry a chair for you, but I--by God!--I had to stand\nup.”\n\n“Heavens above!” ejaculated Plowden, in unfeigned amazement.\n\n“These are little things--mere trifles,” continued Thorpe, dogmatically,\n“but with men of my temper and make-up those are just the things that\naggravate and rankle and hurt. Maybe it's foolish, but that's the kind\nof man I am. You ought to have had the intelligence to see that--and not\nlet these stupid little things happen to annoy me. Why just think what\nyou did. I was going to do God knows what for you--make your fortune and\neverything else,--and you didn't show consideration enough for me to get\nout of bed at a decent hour--much less see to it that I had a chair if\nyou were going to have one.”\n\n“Upon my word, I can't tell how ashamed and sorry I am,” Lord Plowden\nassured him, with fervent contrition in his voice.\n\n“Well, those are the things to guard against,” said Thorpe, approaching\na dismissal of the subject. “People who show consideration for me;\npeople who take pains to do the little pleasant things for me, and see\nthat I'm not annoyed and worried by trifles--they're the people that\nI, on my side, do the big things for. I can be the best friend in the\nworld, but only to those who show that they care for me, and do what\nthey know I'll like. I don't want toadies about me, but I do want people\nwho feel bound to me, and are as keen about me and my feelings and\ninterests as they are about their own.”\n\n“It is delightfully feudal--all this,” commented the nobleman, smilingly\naddressing the remark to nobody in particular. Then he looked at Thorpe.\n“Let me be one of them--one of the people you speak of,” he said, with\ndirectness.\n\nThorpe returned his look with the good-natured beginnings of a grin.\n“But what would you be good for?” he queried, in a bantering tone.\n“People I have about me have to be of some use. They require to have\nheads on their shoulders. Why--just think what you've done. I don't mean\nso much about your letting Tavender slip through your fingers--although\nthat was about the worst I ever heard of. But here in this room, at\nthat desk there, you allowed me to bounce you into writing and signing\na paper which you ought to have had your hand cut off rather than write,\nmuch less sign. You come here trying to work the most difficult and\ndangerous kind of a bluff,--knowing all the while that the witness you\ndepended entirely upon had disappeared, you hadn't the remotest idea\nwhere,--and you actually let me lead you into giving me your signature\nto your own declaration that you are blackmailing me! Thinking it all\nover--you know--I can't see that you would be of much help to me in the\nCity.”\n\nLord Plowden joined perforce in the laughter with which the big man\nenjoyed his own pleasantry. His mirth had some superficial signs of\nshamefacedness, but it was hopeful underneath. “The City!” he echoed,\nwith meaning. “That's the curse of it. What do I know about the City?\nWhat business have I in the City? As you said, I'm the amateur. A strong\nman like you can make me seem any kind of a ridiculous fool he likes,\nwith the turn of his hand. I see that right enough. But what am I to do?\nI have to make a shot at something. I'm so rotten poor!”\n\nThorpe had retired again behind the barrier of dull-eyed abstraction. He\nseemed not to have heard this appealing explanation.\n\nThe other preserved silence in turn, and even made a pretence of looking\nat some pamphlets on the table, as a token of his boundless deference to\nthe master's mood.\n\n“I don't know. I'll see,” the big man muttered at last, doubtfully.\n\nLord Plowden felt warranted in taking an optimistic view of these vague\nwords. “It's awfully good of you”--he began, lamely, and then paused.\n“I wonder,”--he took up a new thought with a more solicitous tone,--“I\nwonder if you would mind returning to me that idiotic paper I signed.”\n\nThorpe shook his head. “Not just now, at any rate,” he said, still\nmusingly. With his head bowed, he took a few restless steps.\n\n“But you are going to--to help me!” the other remarked, with an air of\nconfidence. He had taken up his hat, in response to the tacit warning of\nhis companion's manner.\n\nThorpe looked at him curiously, and hesitated over his answer. It was a\nsurprising and almost unaccountable conclusion for the interview to\nhave reached. He was in some vague way ashamed of himself, but he was\nexplicitly and contemptuously ashamed for Plowden, and the impulse to\nsay so was strong within him. This handsome young gentleman of title\nought not to be escaping with this restored buoyancy of mien, and this\ncomplacency of spirit. He had deserved to be punished with a heavy hand,\nand here he was blithely making certain of new benefits instead.\n\n“I don't know--I'll see,” Thorpe moodily repeated--and there was no more\nto be said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nIN the noon hour of the following day was enacted the brief final scene\nin the drama of the “Rubber Consols corner.”\n\nFor long weeks, Mr. Stormont Thorpe had given much thought to this\napproaching climax of his great adventure--looking forward to it both\nas the crowning event of his life, and as the dawn of a new existence in\nsome novel, enchanted world. It was to bring his triumph, and even more,\nhis release. It was at once to crown him as a hero and chieftain among\nCity men, and transfigure him into a being for whom all City things were\nan abomination. In his waking hours, the conflict between these aims did\nnot specially force itself upon his attention: he mused upon, and spun\nfancies about, either one indifferently, and they seemed not at all\nirreconcilable. But his dreams were full of warfare,--wearily saturated\nwith strife, and endless endeavour to do things which could not be\ndone, and panic-stricken terrors before the shadow of shapeless\ncalamities,--until he dreaded to go to sleep. Then he discovered that\nan extra two glasses of whiskey-and-water would solve that particular\ndifficulty, and send him into prompt, leaden slumber--but the early\nmornings remained as torturing as ever. In the twilight he awoke\noppressed and sick at heart with gloom--and then dozed at intervals\nthrough fantastic new ordeals of anguish and shame and fear, till it was\ndecently possible to get up.\n\nThen, indeed, the big cold sponge on his head and spine scattered these\nfoolish troubles like chaff, and restored to him his citizenship among\nthe realities. He dressed with returning equanimity, and was almost\ncheerful by the time he thrust his razor into the hot water. Yet\nincreasingly he was conscious of the wear and strain of it all, and\nincreasingly the date, September twelfth, loomed before him with a\nportentous individuality of its own.\n\nThis day grew to mean so much more to him than had all the other days\nof the dead years together that he woke in the darkness of its opening\nhours, and did not get satisfactorily to sleep again. His vigil,\nhowever, was for the once free from grief. He drowsily awaited the\nmorning in vague mental comfort; he had recurring haphazard indolent\nglimpses of a protecting fact standing guard just outside the portals\nof consciousness--the fact that the great day was here. He rose early,\nbreakfasted well, and walked by the Embankment to the City, where at\nten he had a few words with Semple, and afterward caused himself to be\ndenied to ordinary callers. He paced up and down the Board Room for the\nbetter part of the ensuing two hours, luxuriating in the general sense\nof satisfaction in the proximity of the climax, rather than pretending\nto himself that he was thinking out its details. He had provided in his\nplans of the day for a visit from Messrs. Rostocker and Aronson, which\nshould constitute the dramatic finale of the “corner,” and he looked\nforward to this meeting with a certain eagerness of expectation. Yet\neven here he thought broadly of the scene as a whole, and asked himself\nno questions about words and phrases. It seemed to be taken for granted\nin his mind that the scene itself would be theatrically impressive, even\nspectacular.\n\nIn the event, this long-awaited culmination proved to be disappointingly\nflat and commonplace. It was over before Thorpe had said any\nconsiderable proportion of the things he saw afterward that he had\nintended to say. The two men came as he had expected they would--and\nthey bought their way out of the tragic “corner” at precisely the price\nhe had nominated in his mind. But hardly anything else went as he had\ndimly prefigured it.\n\nMr. Rostocker was a yellow-haired man, and Mr. Aronson was as dark as a\nMoor, and no physical resemblance of features or form suggested itself\nto the comparing eye, yet Thorpe even now, when they stood brusquely\nsilent before him, with their carefully-brushed hats pulled down over\ntheir eyes, stuck to it in his own mind that it was hard to tell them\napart. To the end, there was something impersonal in his feeling toward\nthem. They, for their part, coldly abstained from exhibiting a sign of\nfeeling about him, good, bad, or indifferent.\n\nIt was the man with the fair hair and little curly flaxen beard who\nspoke: “How do you do! I understand that we can buy eight thousand five\nhundred Rubber Consols from you at 'twenty-three.'”\n\n“No--twenty-five,” replied Thorpe.\n\nThe dark man spoke: “The jobbers' price is twenty-three.”\n\n“To carry over--yes,” Thorpe answered. “But to buy it is twenty-five.”\n\nThe two sons of the race which invented mental arithmetic exchanged an\nalert glance, and looked at the floor for an engrossed instant.\n\n“I don't mind telling you,” Thorpe interposed upon their silence, “I put\non that extra two pounds because you got up that story about applying to\nthe Stock Exchange Committee on a charge of fraud.”\n\n“We didn't get up any story,” said Rostocker, curtly.\n\n“You tried to plant it on us,” Aronson declared.\n\n“One of your own Directors put it about. I thought it was a fake at the\ntime.”\n\nThis view of the episode took Thorpe by surprise. As it seemed, in\npassing, to involve a compliment to his own strategic powers, he\naccepted it without comment. “Well--it is twenty-five, anyway,” he told\nthem, with firmness.\n\n“Twenty-four,” suggested Aronson, after another momentary pause.\n\n“Not a shilling less than twenty-five,” Thorpe insisted, with quiet\ndoggedness.\n\n“We can always pay our creditors and let you whistle,” Rostocker\nreminded him, laconically.\n\n“You can do anything you like,” was the reply, “except buy Rubber\nConsols under twenty-five. It doesn't matter a fig to me whether you go\nbankrupt or not. It would suit me as well to have you two 'hammered' as\nto take your money.” Upon the spur of a sudden thought he drew out his\nwatch. “In just two minutes' time to a tick, the price will be thirty.”\n\n“Let's be 'hammered' then!” said Aronson to his companion, with\nsimulated impulsiveness.\n\nRostocker was the older and stronger man, and when at last he spoke it\nwas with the decision of one in authority. “It is your game,” he\nsaid, with grave imperturbability. “Eight thousand five hundred at\ntwenty-five. Will you deliver at the Credit Lyonnais in half an hour?”\n\nThorpe nodded, impassively. Then a roving idea of genial impertinence\nbrought a gleam to his eye. “If you should happen to want more Rubber\nConsols at any time,” he said, with a tentative chuckle, “I could\nprobably let you have them at a reduced price.”\n\nThe two received the pleasantry without a smile, but to Thorpe's\nastonishment one of them seemed to discern something in it beside\nbanter. It was Rostocker who said: “Perhaps we may make a deal with\nyou,” and apparently meant it.\n\nThey went out at this, ignoring ceremony upon their exit as stolidly as\nthey had done upon their entrance, and a moment later Thorpe called in\nthe Secretary, and despatched a messenger to bring Semple from Capel\nCourt. The formalities of this final transfer of shares had been\ndictated to the former, and he had gone off on the business, before the\nBroker arrived.\n\nThorpe stood waiting near the door, and held out his hand with a\ndramatically significant gesture when the little Scotchman entered. “Put\nher there!” he exclaimed heartily, with an exuberant reversion to the\nslang of remote transatlantic bonhomie.\n\n“Yeh've done it, then!” said Semple, his sharp face softening with\npleasure at the news. “Yeh've pulled it off at twenty-three!”\n\nThe other's big countenance yielded itself to a boyish grin.\n“Twenty-FIVE!” he said, and laughed aloud. “After you left this morning,\nit kind o' occurred to me that I'd raise it a couple of pounds. I found\nI was madder about those pieces in the newspapers than I thought I was,\nand so I took an extra seventeen thousand pounds on that account.”\n\n“God above!” Semple ejaculated, with a satisfaction through which signs\nof an earlier fright were visible. “It was touch-and-go if you didn't\nlose it all by doing that! You risked everything, man!”\n\nThorpe ponderously shrugged his shoulders. “Well--I did it, anyhow, and\nit came off,” was his comment. Then, straightening himself, he drew a\nlong, long breath, and beamed down at the little man. “Think of it! God!\nIt's actually all over! And NOW perhaps we won't have a drink! Hell!\nLet's send out for some champagne!” His finger was hovering over the\nbell, when the Broker's dissuading voice arrested it. “No, no!” Semple\nurged. “I wouldn't touch it. It's no fit drink for the daytime--and it's\na scandal in an office. Your clerks will aye blab it about hither and\nyon, and nothing harms a man's reputation more in the City.”\n\n“Oh, to hell with the City!” cried Thorpe, joyously. “I'm never going to\nset foot in it again. Think of that! I mean it!”\n\nNone the less, he abandoned the idea of sending out for wine, and\ncontented himself with the resources of the cabinet instead. After some\nfriendly pressure, Semple consented to join him in a brandy-and-soda,\nthough he continued to protest between sips that at such an hour it was\nan indecent practice.\n\n“It's the ruin of many a strong man,” he moralized, looking rather\npointedly at Thorpe over his glass. “It's the principal danger that\nbesets the verra successful man. He's too busily occupied to take\nexercise, and he's too anxious and worried to get his proper sleep--but\nhe can always drink! In one sense, I'm not sorry to think that you're\nleaving the City.”\n\n“Oh, it never hurts me,” Thorpe said, indifferently accepting the\ndirection of the homily. “I'm as strong as an ox. But all the same, I\nshall be better in every way for getting out of this hole. Thank God, I\ncan get off to Scotland tomorrow. But I say, Semple, what's the matter\nwith your visiting me at my place there? I'll give you the greatest\nshooting and fishing you ever heard of.”\n\nThe Broker was thinking of something else. “What is to be the precise\nposition of the Company, in the immediate future?” he asked.\n\n“Company? What Company?”\n\nSemple smiled grimly. “Have you already forgotten that there is such a\nthing?” he queried, with irony. “Why, man, this Company that paid for\nthis verra fine Board-table,” he explained, with his knuckles on its red\nbaize centre.\n\nThorpe laughed amusedly. “I paid for that out of my own pocket,” he\nsaid. “For that matter everything about the Company has come out of my\npocket----”\n\n“Or gone into it,” suggested the other, and they chuckled together.\n\n“But no--you're right,” Thorpe declared. “Some thing ought to be settled\nabout the Company, I suppose. Of course I wash my hands of it--but would\nanybody else want to go on with it? You see its annual working expenses,\nmerely for the office and the Board, foot up nearly 3,000 pounds. I've\npaid these for this year, but naturally I won't do it again. And would\nit be worth anybody else's while to do it? Yours, for example?”\n\n“Have you had any explanations with the other Directors?” the Broker\nasked, thoughtfully.\n\n“Explanations--no,” Thorpe told him. “But that's all right. The Marquis\nhas been taken care of, and so has Plowden. They're game to agree to\nanything. And let's see--Kervick is entirely my man. That leaves Watkin\nand Davidson--and they don't matter. They're mere guinea-pigs. A few\nhundreds apiece would shut them up, if you thought it was worth while to\ngive them anything at all.”\n\n“And about the property,--the rubber plantation,--that the Company\nwas formed to acquire and develop. I suppose there really is such a\nplantation?”\n\n“Oh, yes, it's all there right enough,” Thorpe said, briefly.\n\n“It's no good, though, is it?” the Broker asked, with affable\ndirectness.\n\n“Between ourselves, it isn't worth a damn,” the other blithely assured\nhim.\n\nThe Scotchman mused with bent brows. “There ought still to be money in\nit,” he said, with an air of conviction.\n\n“By the way,” it occurred to Thorpe to mention, “here's something I\ndidn't understand. I told Rostocker here, just as a cheeky kind of joke,\nthat after he and Aronson had got their eight thousand five hundred, if\nthey thought they'd like still more shares, I'd let 'em have 'em at a\nbargain--and he seemed to take it seriously. He did for a fact. Said\nperhaps he could make a deal with me.”\n\n“Hm-m!” said Semple, reflectively. “I'll see if he says anything to\nme. Very likely he's spotted some way of taking the thing over, and\nreorganizing it, and giving it another run over the course. I'll think\nit out. And now I must be off. Aren't you lunching?”\n\n“No--I'll have the boy bring in some sandwiches,” Thorpe decided. “I\nwant my next meal west of Temple Bar when I get round to it. I've soured\non the City for keeps.”\n\n“I wouldn't say that it had been so bad to you, either,” Semple\nsmilingly suggested, as he turned to the door.\n\nThorpe grinned in satisfied comment. “Hurry back as soon as you've\nfinally settled with Rostocker and the other fellow,” he called after\nhim, and began pacing the floor again.\n\nIt was nearly four o'clock when these two men, again together in the\nBoard Room, and having finished the inspection of some papers on the\ndesk, sat upright and looked at each other in tacit recognition that\nfinal words were to be spoken.\n\n“Well, Semple,” Thorpe began, after that significant little pause, “I\nwant to say that I'm damned glad you've done so well for yourself in\nthis affair. You've been as straight as a die to me,--I owe it as much\nto you as I do to myself,--and if you don't think you've got enough even\nnow, I want you to say so.”\n\nHe had spoken in tones of sincere liking, and the other answered him in\nkind. “I have more than I ever dreamed of making in a lifetime when I\ncame to London,” he declared. “If my father were alive, and heard me\ntell him that in one year, out of a single transaction, I had cleared\nover sixty-five thousand pounds, he'd be fit to doubt the existence of a\nSupreme Being. I'm obliged to you for your good words, Thorpe. It's not\nonly been profitable to work with you, but it has been a great education\nand a great pleasure as well.”\n\nThorpe nodded his appreciation. “I'm going to ask a favour of you,” he\nsaid. “I want to leave the general run of my investments and interests\nhere in your hands, to keep track of I don't want to speculate at all,\nin the ordinary meaning of the word. Even after I bury a pot of money in\nnon-productive real estate, I shall have an income of 50,000 pounds at\nthe very least, and perhaps twice as much. There's no fun in gambling\nwhen you've got such a bank as that behind you. But if there are good,\nwise changes to be made in investments, or if things turn up in the way\nof chances that I ought to know about, I want to feel that you're on the\nspot watching things and doing things in my interest. And as it won't\nbe regular broker's work, I shall want to pay you a stated sum--whatever\nyou think is right.”\n\n“That will arrange itself easily enough,” said Semple. “I shall have\nthe greatest pleasure in caring for whatever you put in my hands. And I\nthink I can promise that it will be none the worse for the keeping.”\n\n“I don't need any assurance on that score,” Thorpe declared, cordially.\n“You're the one sterling, honest man I've known in the City.”\n\nIt was the Broker's turn to make a little acknowledging bow. His eyes\ngleamed frank satisfaction at being so well understood. “I think I\nsee the way that more money can be made out of the Company,” he said,\nabruptly changing the subject. “I've had but a few words with Rostocker\nabout it--but it's clear to me that he has a plan. He will be coming to\nyou with a proposition.”\n\n“Well, he won't find me, then,” interposed Thorpe, with a comfortable\nsmile. “I leave all that to you.”\n\n“I suspect that his plan,” continued Semple, “is to make a sub-rosa\noffer of a few shillings for the majority of the shares, and\nreconstitute the Board, and then form another Company to buy the\nproperty and good-will of the old one at a handsome price. Now if that\nwould be a good thing for him to do, it would be a good thing for me\nto do. I shall go over it all carefully, in detail, this evening. And I\nsuppose, if I see my way clear before me, than I may rely upon your good\nfeeling in the matter. I would do all the work and assume all the risk,\nand, let us say, divide any profits equally--you in turn giving me a\nfree hand with all your shares, and your influence with the Directors.”\n\n“I'll do better still,” Thorpe told him, upon brief reflection.\n“Reconstitute the Board and make Lord Plowden Chairman,--I don't imagine\nthe Marquis would have the nerve to go on with it,--and I'll make a free\ngift of my shares to you two--half and half. You'll find him all right\nto work with,--if you can only get him up in the morning,--and I've kind\no' promised him something of the sort. Does that suit you?” Semple's\ncountenance was thoughtful rather than enthusiastic. “I'm more skeptical\nabout Lords than you are,” he observed, “but if he's amenable, and\nunderstands that his part is to do what I tell him to do, I've no doubt\nwe shall hit it off together.”\n\n“Oh, absolutely!” said Thorpe, with confidence. “I'll see to it that he\nbehaves like a lamb. You're to have an absolutely free hand. You're to\ndo what you like,--wind the Company up, or sell it out, or rig it up\nunder a new name and catch a new set of gudgeons with it,--whatever you\ndamned please. When I trust a man, I trust him.”\n\nThe two friends, their faces brightened and their voices mellowed by\nthis serene consciousness of their mutual trust in each other's loyalty\nand integrity, dwelt no further upon these halcyon beginnings of a\nfresh plan for plundering the public. They spoke instead on personal\ntopics--of the possibility of Semple's coming to Scotland during the\nautumn, and of the chance of Thorpe's wintering abroad. All at once\nThorpe found himself disclosing the fact of his forthcoming marriage,\nthough he did not mention the name of the lady's father, and under\nthe gracious stress of this announcement they drank again, and clinked\nglasses fervently. When Semple at last took his leave, they shook hands\nwith the deep-eyed earnestness of comrades who have been through battle\nand faced death together.\n\nIt was not until Thorpe stood alone that the full realizing sense of\nwhat the day meant seemed to come to him. Fruition was finally complete:\nthe last winnowing of the great harvest had been added to the pile.\nPositively nothing remained for him but to enter and enjoy!\n\nHe found it curiously difficult to grasp the thought in its entirety. He\nstood the master of unlimited leisure for the rest of his life, and of\npower to enrich that life with everything that money could buy,--but\nthere was an odd inability to feel about it as he knew he ought to feel.\n\nSomehow, for some unaccountable reason, an absurd depression hovered\nabout over his mind, darkening it with formless shadows. It was as if he\nwere sorry that the work was all finished--that there was nothing more\nfor him to do. But that was too foolish, and he tried to thrust it from\nhim. He said with angry decision to himself that he had never liked the\nwork; that it had all been unpleasant and grinding drudgery, tolerable\nonly as a means to an end; that now this end had been reached, he wanted\nnever to lay eyes on the City again.\n\nLet him dwell instead upon the things he did want to lay eyes upon. Some\ntravel no doubt he would like, but not too much; certainly no more than\nhis wife would cheerfully accept as a minimum. He desired rather to rest\namong his own possessions. To be lord of the manor at Pellesley Court,\nwith his own retinue of servants and dependents and tenants, his own\nthousands of rich acres, his own splendid old timber, his own fat stock\nand fleet horses and abundant covers and prize kennels--THAT was what\nmost truly appealed to him. It was not at all certain that he would\nhunt; break-neck adventure in the saddle scarcely attracted him. But\nthere was no reason in the world why he should not breed racing horses,\nand create for himself a distinguished and even lofty position on the\nTurf. He had never cared much about races or racing folk himself, but\nwhen the Prince and Lord Rosebery and people like that went in for\nwinning the Derby, there clearly must be something fascinating in it.\n\nThen Parliament, of course; he did not waver at all from his old if\nvague conception of a seat in Parliament as a natural part of the outfit\nof a powerful country magnate. And in a hundred other ways men should\nthink of him as powerful, and look up to him. He would go to church\nevery Sunday, and sit in the big Squire's pew. He would be a magistrate\nas a matter of course, and he would make himself felt on the County\nCouncil. He would astonish the county by his charities, and in bad years\nby the munificence of his reductions in rents. Perhaps if there were a\nparticularly bad harvest, he would decline all over his estate to exact\nany rent whatever. Fancy what a noble sensation that would make! A Duke\ncould do no more.\n\nIt was very clear to him now that he desired to have children of his\nown,--say two at least, a son and a daughter, or perhaps a son and\ntwo daughters: two little girls would be company for each other. As he\nprefigured these new beings, the son was to exist chiefly for purposes\nof distinction and the dignity of heirship, and the paternal relations\nwith him would be always somewhat formal, and, though affectionate,\nunexpansive. But the little girls--they would put their arms round their\nfather's neck, and walk out with him to see the pigs and the dogs, and\nbe the darlings of his heart. He would be an old man by the time they\ngrew up.\n\nA beatific vision of himself took form in his mind--of himself growing\ngrey and pleasurably tired, surrounded by opulence and the demonstrative\nrespect of everybody, smiling with virtuous content as he strolled along\nbetween his two daughters, miracles of beauty and tenderness, holding\neach by a hand.\n\nThe entrance of a clerk broke abruptly upon this daydream. He had a\ntelegram in his hand, and Thorpe, rousing himself with an effort,\ntook the liver-coloured envelope, and looked blankly at it. Some weird\napprehension seized upon him, as if he belonged to the peasant class\nwhich instinctively yokes telegrams and calamities together. He deferred\nto this feeling enough to nod dismissal to the clerk, and then, when he\nwas again alone, slowly opened the message, and read it:\n\n“Newcastle-on-Tyne, September 12. Our friend died at Edinboro this\nmorning. See you at hotel this evening.--Kervick.”\n\n\nWhat Thorpe felt at first was that his two daughters had shrunk from him\nwith swift, terrible aversion: they vanished, along with every phase of\nthe bright vision, under a pall of unearthly blackness. He stood in the\ncentre of a chill solitude, staring stupidly at the coarse, soft paper.\n\nThe premonition, then, had justified itself! Something had told him that\nthe telegram was an evil thing. A vaguely superstitious consciousness\nof being in the presence of Fate laid hold upon him. His great day of\ntriumph had its blood-stain. A victim had been needful--and to that\nend poor simple, silly old Tavender was a dead man. Thorpe could see\nhim,--an embarrassing cadaver eyed by strangers who did not know what to\ndo with it,--fatuous even in death.\n\nA sudden rage at Kervick flamed up. He clearly had played the\nfool--clumsily over-plying the simpleton with drink till he had killed\nhim. The shadow of murder indubitably hung over the thing. And then--the\ncrass witlessness of telegraphing! Already, doubtless, the police of\nEdinborough were talking over the wires with Scotland Yard. A reference\nto a death in Edinborough, in a telegram from Newcastle--it was\nincredible that this should escape the eye of the authorities. Any\nminute might bring a detective through that door there--following into\nthe Board Room with his implacable scent the clue of blood. Thorpe's\nfancy pictured this detective as a momentarily actual presence--tall,\nlean, cold-eyed, mysteriously calm and fatally wise, the omniscient\nterror of the magazine short-stories.\n\nHe turned faint and sick under a spasm of fright. The menace of enquiry\nbecame something more than a threat: he felt it, like the grip of a\nconstable upon his arm. Everything would be mercilessly unravelled. The\ntelegram of the idiot Kervick would bring the police down upon him like\na pack of beagles. The beliefs and surmises of the idiot Gafferson would\nfurnish them with the key to everything. He would have his letter from\nTavender to show to the detectives--and the Government's smart lawyers\nwould ferret out the rest. The death of Tavender--they could hardly make\nhim responsible for that; but it was the dramatic feature of this death\nwhich would inspire them all to dig up everything about the fraud. It\nwas this same sensational added element of the death, too, which would\ncount with a jury. They were always gross, sentimental fools, these\njuries. They would mix up the death and the deal in Rubber Consols,\nand in their fat-headed confusion would say “Penal Servitude--fourteen\nyears.” Or no, it was the Judge who fixed that. But the Judges were\nfools, too; they were too conceited, too puffed up with vanity, to\ntake the trouble to understand. He groaned aloud in a nightmare of\nhelplessness.\n\nThe sound of his own voice, moaning in his ears, had a magical effect\nupon him. He lifted his head, gazed about him, and then flushed deeply.\nHis nerveless cowardice had all at once become unbelievable to himself.\nWith a shamed frown he straightened himself, and stood thus for a long\nminute, engrossed in the definite task of chasing these phantoms from\nhis mind. Once a manly front was displayed to them, they slunk away with\nmiraculous facility. He poured out some brandy, and sipped it neat, and\nlaughed scornfully, defiantly, aloud.\n\nHe had over half a million--with power and force and courage enough to\ndo with it what he liked. He had fought luck undauntedly, unwearyingly,\nduring all those years when his hands were empty. Was he to tremble\nand turn tail now, when his hands were full, when he was armoured and\nweaponed at every point? He was amazed and hurt, and still more enraged,\nat that fit of girlish weakness which had possessed him. He could\nhave beaten himself with stripes for it. But it could never happen\nagain--never, never!\n\nHe told himself that with proud, resolute reiteration, as he got his hat\nand stick, and put in his pockets one or two papers from the desk, and\nthen glanced about the Board Room for what was, most likely, the last\ntime. Here he had won his great victory over Fate, here he had put his\nenemies under his feet, and if innocent simpletons had wandered into the\ncompany of these foes, it mattered not a whit to him that they also had\nbeen crushed. Figuratively, he turned his back upon them now; he left\nthem, slain and trampled, in the Board Room behind him. They no longer\nconcerned him.\n\nFiguratively, too, as he walked with firmness to the door, he stepped\nover the body of old Tavender, upon the threshold, and bestowed upon\nit a downward mental glance, and passed on. By the time he reached the\nstreet, the memory of Tavender had become the merest shred of a myth. As\nhe strode on, it seemed to him that his daughters came again, and\ntook his hands, and moved lovingly beside him--lovingly and still more\nadmiringly than before.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nBY the autumn of the following year, a certain small proportion of the\npeople inhabiting the district in Hertfordshire which set its clocks\nby the dial over the stable-tower of Pellesley Court had accustomed\nthemselves to give the place its new name of High Thorpe. These were\nfor the most part the folk of peculiarly facile wits and ready powers\nof adaptation, like pushing small tradesmen, and the upper servants in\ncounty houses. An indolent and hazy compromise upon Pellesley Thorpe had\ndrifted into use by perhaps a larger number. To the puzzled conservatism\nof the abiding huge majority nearest to the soil--the round-backed,\nlumpish men who tie strings round their corduroys under the knee, and\nthe strong, cow-faced women who look at passers-by on the road from\nthe doors of dark little cottages, over radiant patches of blossoming\ngarden--it seemed safest to drop family names altogether, and call it\nmerely the Court.\n\nIt stood proudly upon what was rather a notable elevation for those flat\nparts--a massive mansion of simple form, built of a grey stone which\nseemed at a distance almost white against the deep background of yews\nand Italian pines behind it. For many miles seaward this pale front\nwas a landmark. From the terrace-walk at its base, one beheld a great\nexpanse of soft green country, sloping gently away for a long distance,\nthen stretching out upon a level which on misty days was interminable.\nIn bright weather, the remote, low-lying horizon had a defining line of\nbrownish-blue--and this stood for what was left of a primitive forest,\ncontaining trees much older than the Norman name it bore. It was a\nforest which at some time, no doubt, had extended without a break till\nit merged into that of Epping--leagues away to the south. The modern\nclearance and tillage, however, which separated it now from Epping had\nserved as a curiously effective barrier--more baffling than the Romans\nand Angles in their turn had found the original wildwood. No stranger\nseemed ever to find his way into that broad, minutely-cultivated fertile\nplain which High Thorpe looked down upon. No railway had pushed its\ncheapening course across it. Silent, embowered old country roads and\nlanes netted its expanse with hedgerows; red points of tiled roofs,\ndistinguishable here and there in clusters among the darker greens of\norchards, identified the scattered hamlets--all named in Domesday Book,\nall seemingly unchanged since. A grey square church-tower emerging from\nthe rooks' nests; an ordered mass of foliage sheltering the distant\ngables and chimneys of some isolated house; the dim perception on\noccasion that a rustic waggon was in motion on some highway, crawling\npatiently like an insect--of this placid, inductive nature were all the\nadded proofs of human occupation that the landscape offered.\n\nMr. Stormont Thorpe, on an afternoon of early October, yawned in the\nface of this landscape--and then idly wondered a little at the mood\nwhich had impelled him to do so. At the outset of his proprietorship he\nhad bound himself, as by a point of honour, to regard this as the finest\nview from any gentleman's house in England. During the first few months\nhis fidelity had been taxed a good deal, but these temptations and\nstruggles lay now all happily behind him. He had satisfactorily\nassimilated the spirit of the vista, and blended it with his own. Its\ninertia, when one came to comprehend it, was undeniably magnificent,\nand long ago he had perceived within himself the growth of an answering\nrepose, a responsive lethargy, which in its full development was\nalso going to be very fine. Practically all the land this side of the\nimpalpable line where trees and houses began to fade into the background\nbelonged to him; there were whole villages nestling half-concealed\nunder its shrubberies which were his property. As an investment, these\npossessions were extremely unremunerative. Indeed, if one added the cost\nof the improvements which ought to be made, to the expenditure already\nlaid out in renovations, it was questionable if for the next twenty\nyears they would not represent a deficit on the income-sheet. But, now\nthat he had laid hold of the local character, it pleased him that it\nshould be so. He would not for the world have his gentle, woolly-minded,\nunprofitable cottagers transformed into “hustlers”; it would wound\nhis eye to see the smoke of any commercial chimney, the smudge of\nany dividend-paying factory, staining the pure tints of the sylvan\nlandscape. He had truly learned to love it.\n\nYet now, as he strolled on the terrace with his first after-luncheon\ncigar, he unaccountably yawned at the thing he loved. Upon reflection,\nhe had gone to bed rather earlier the previous evening than usual.\nHe had not been drinking out of the ordinary; his liver seemed right\nenough. He was not conscious of being either tired or drowsy. He looked\nagain at the view with some fixity, and said to himself convincingly\nthat nothing else in England could compare with it. It was the finest\nthing there was anywhere. Then he surprised himself in the middle of\nanother yawn--and halted abruptly. It occurred to him that he wanted to\ntravel.\n\nSince his home-coming to this splendid new home in the previous January,\nat the conclusion of a honeymoon spent in Algiers and Egypt, he had not\nbeen out of England. There had been a considerable sojourn in London, it\nis true, at what was described to him as the height of the Season, but\nlooking back upon it, he could not think of it as a diversion. It had\nbeen a restless, over-worked, mystifying experience, full of dinners\nto people whom he had never seen before, and laborious encounters with\nother people whom he did not particularly want to see again. There\nhad been no physical comfort in it for him, and little more mental\nsatisfaction, for Londoners, or rather people in London, seemed all to\nbe making an invidious distinction in their minds between him and his\nwife. The fact that she continued to be called Lady Cressage was not\nof itself important to him. But in the incessant going about in\nLondon, their names were called out together so often that his ear grew\nsensitive and sore to the touch of the footmen's reverberations. The\nmeaning differentiation which the voices of the servants insisted\nupon, seemed inevitably reflected in the glance and manner of their\nmistresses. More than anything else, that made him hate London, and\nbarred the doors of his mind to all thoughts of buying a town-house.\n\nHis newly-made wife, it is true, had not cared much for London,\neither, and had agreed to his decision against a town-house almost\nwith animation. The occasion of their return from the hot bustle of the\nmetropolis to these cool home shades--in particular the minute in which,\nat a bend in the winding carriage-way down below, they had silently\nregarded together the spectacle uplifted before them, with the big,\nwelcoming house, and the servants on the terrace--had a place of its own\nin his memory. Edith had pressed his arm, as they sat side by side in\nthe landau, on the instant compulsion of a feeling they had in common.\nHe had never, before or since, had quite the same assurance that she\nshared an emotion with him.\n\nHe was very far, however, from finding fault with his wife. It was in\nthe nature of the life he chose to lead that he should see a great\ndeal of her, and think a great deal about her, and she bore both tests\nadmirably. If there was a fault to be found, it was with himself for\nhis inability to altogether understand her. She played the part she had\nundertaken to play with abundant skill and discretion and grace, and\neven with an air of nice good-fellowship which had some of the aspects\nof affection. He was vaguely annoyed with himself for having insight\nenough to perceive that it was a part she was playing, and yet lacking\nthe added shrewdness to divine what her own personal attitude to her\nrole was like. He had noticed sometimes the way good women looked at\ntheir husbands when the latter were talking over their heads--with the\neager, intent, non-comprehending admiration of an affectionate dog. This\nwas a look which he could not imagine himself discovering in his wife's\neves. It was not conceivable to him that he should talk over her head.\nHer glance not only revealed an ample understanding of all he said, but\nsuggested unused reserves of comprehension which he might not fathom. It\nwas as if, intellectually no less than socially, she possessed a title\nand he remained an undistinguished plebeian.\n\nHe made no grievance, however, even in his own thoughts, of either\ninequality. She had been charmingly frank and fair about the question of\nthe names, when it first arose. The usage had latterly come to be, she\nexplained, for a widow bearing even a courtesy title derived from her\nlate husband, to retain it on marrying again. It was always the easiest\ncourse to fall in with usage, but if he had any feelings on the subject,\nand preferred to have her insist on being called Mrs. Thorpe, she would\nmeet his wishes with entire willingness. It had seemed to him, as to\nher, that it was wisest to allow usage to settle the matter. Some months\nafter their marriage there appeared in the papers what purported to be\nan authoritative announcement that the Queen objected to the practice\namong ladies who married a second time, of retaining titles acquired by\nthe earlier marriages, and that the lists of precedency at Buckingham\nPalace would henceforth take this into account. Lady Cressage showed\nthis to her husband, and talked again with candour on the subject. She\nsaid she had always rather regretted the decision they originally came\nto, and even now could wish that it might be altered, but that to effect\na change in the face of this newspaper paragraph would seem servile--and\nin this as in most other things he agreed with her. As she said, they\nwanted nothing of Buckingham Palace.\n\nShe wanted equally little, it seemed, of the society which the\nneighbouring district might afford. There was a meagre routine of formal\ncalls kept in languid operation, Thorpe knew, but it was so much in the\nbackground that he never came in contact with it. His own notions of\nthe part he ought to take in County affairs had undergone a silent and\nunnoted, yet almost sweeping, change. What little he saw of the gentry\nand strong local men with whom he would have to work, quietly undermined\nand dismantled all his ambitions in that direction. They were not his\nsort; their standards for the measurement of things were unintelligible\nto him. He did not doubt that, if he set himself about it, he could\nimpose his dominion upon them, any more than he doubted that, if he\nmastered the Chinese language, he could lift himself to be a Mandarin,\nbut the one would be as unnatural and unattractive an enterprise as\nthe other. He came to be upon nodding terms with most of the\n“carriage-people” round about; some few he exchanged meaningless words\nwith upon occasion, and understood that his wife also talked with, when\nit was unavoidable, but there his relationship to the County ended,\nand he was well pleased that it should be so. It gave him a deep\nsatisfaction to see that his wife seemed also well pleased.\n\nHe used the word “seemed” in his inmost musings, for it was never quite\ncertain what really did please and displease her. It was always puzzling\nto him to reconcile her undoubted intellectual activity with the\npractical emptiness of the existence she professed to enjoy. In one\ndirection, she had indeed a genuine outlet for her energies, which he\ncould understand her regarding in the light of an occupation. She was\ncrazier about flowers and plants than anybody he had ever heard of,\nand it had delighted him to make over to her, labelled jocosely as the\nbouquet-fund, a sum of money which, it seemed to him, might have paid\nfor the hanging-gardens of Babylon. It yielded in time--emerging slowly\nbut steadily from a prodigious litter of cement and bricks and mortar\nand putty, under the hands of innumerable masons, carpenters, glaziers,\nplumbers, and nondescript subordinates, all of whom talked unwearyingly\nabout nothing at all, and suffered no man to perform any part of his\nallotted task without suspending their own labours to watch him--an\nimposing long line of new greenhouses, more than twenty in number. The\nmail-bag was filled meanwhile with nurserymen's catalogues, and the cart\nmade incessant journeys to and from Punsey station, bringing back vast\nstraw-enwrapped baskets and bundles and boxes beyond counting, the\narrival and unpacking of which was with Edith the event of the day.\nAbout the reality of her engrossed interest in all the stages of\nprogress by which these greenhouses became crowded museums of the\nunusual and abnormal in plant-life, it was impossible to have any\nsuspicion. And even after they were filled to overflowing, Thorpe noted\nwith joy that this interest seemed in no wise to flag. She spent hours\nevery day under the glass, exchanging comments and theories with her\ngardeners, and even pulling things about with her own hands, and other\nhours she devoted almost as regularly to supervising the wholesale\nalterations that had been begun in the gardens outside. There were to\nbe new paths, new walls with a southern exposure, new potting sheds, new\nforcing pits, new everything--and in the evenings she often worked late\nover the maps and plans she drew for all this. Thorpe's mind found it\ndifficult to grasp the idea that a lady of such notable qualities could\nbe entirely satisfied by a career among seeds and bulbs and composts,\nbut at least time brought no evidences of a decline in her horticultural\nzeal. Who knew? Perhaps it might go on indefinitely.\n\nAs for himself, he had got on very well without any special inclination\nor hobby. He had not done any of the great things that a year ago it\nhad seemed to him he would forthwith do--but his mind was serenely\nundisturbed by regrets. He did not even remember with any distinctness\nwhat these things were that he had been going to do. The routine of\nlife--as arranged and borne along by the wise and tactful experts who\nwore the livery of High Thorpe--was abundantly sufficient in itself. He\nslept well now in the morning hours, and though he remained still, by\ncomparison, an early riser, the bath and the shaving and slow dressing\nunder the hands of a valet consumed comfortably a good deal of time.\nThroughout the day he was under the almost constant observation of\npeople who were calling him “master” in their minds, and watching to see\nhow, in the smallest details of deportment, a “master” carried himself,\nand the consciousness of this alone amounted to a kind of vocation. The\nhouse itself made demands upon him nearly as definite as those of the\nservants. It was a house of huge rooms, high ceilings, and grandiose\nfireplaces and stairways, which had seemed to him like a royal palace\nwhen he first beheld it, and still produced upon him an effect of\nundigestible largeness and strangeness. It was as a whole not so old as\nthe agents had represented it, by some centuries, but it adapted itself\nas little to his preconceived notions of domesticity as if it had been\nbuilt by Druids. The task of seeming to be at home in it had as many\nsides to it as there were minutes in the day--and oddly enough, Thorpe\nfound in their study and observance a congenial occupation. Whether he\nwas reading in the library--where there was an admirable collection of\nbooks of worth--or walking over the home-farms, or driving in his smart\nstanhope with the coachman behind, or sitting in formal costume and\ndignity opposite his beautiful wife at the dinner-table, the sense of\nwhat was expected of him was there, steadying and restraining, like an\natmospheric pressure.\n\nThus far they had had few visitors, and had accepted no invitations to\njoin house-parties elsewhere. They agreed without speaking about it that\nit was more their form to entertain than to be entertained, and certain\npeople were coming to them later in the month. These were quite wholly\nof Edith's set and selection, for Thorpe had no friends or acquaintances\noutside her circle for whose presence he had any desire--and among these\nprospective guests were a Duke and a Duchess. Once, such a fact would\nhave excited Thorpe's imagination. He regarded it now as something\nappropriate under the circumstances, and gave it little further thought.\nHis placid, satisfied life was not dependent upon the stir of guests\ncoming and going, even though they were the great of the earth.\nHe walked on his spacious terrace after luncheon--a tall, portly,\nwell-groomed figure of a man, of relaxed, easy aspect, with his big\ncigar, and his panama hat, and his loose clothes of choice fabrics and\nexquisite tailoring--and said to himself that it was the finest view\nin England--and then, to his own surprise, caught himself in the act of\nyawning.\n\nFrom under the silk curtains and awning of a window-doorway at the end\nof the terrace, his wife issued and came toward him. Her head was bare,\nand she had the grace and fresh beauty of a young girl in her simple\nlight gown of some summery figured stuff.\n\n“What do you say to going off somewhere--tomorrow if you\nlike--travelling abroad?” he called out, as she approached him. The\nidea, only a moment old in his mind, had grown to great proportions.\n“How can we?” she asked, upon the briefest thought. “THEY are coming at\nthe end of the week. This is Monday, and they arrive on the 12th--that's\nthis Saturday.”\n\n“So soon as that!” he exclaimed. “I thought it was later. H-m! I don't\nknow--I think perhaps I'll go up to London this evening. I'm by way of\nfeeling restless all at once. Will you come up with me?”\n\nShe shook her head. “I can't think of anything in London that would be\ntolerable.”\n\nHe gave a vague little laugh. “I shall probably hate it myself when I\nget there,” he speculated. “There isn't anybody I want to see--there\nisn't anything I want to do. I don' t know--perhaps it might liven me\nup.”\n\nHer face took on a look of enquiring gravity. “Are you getting tired of\nit, then?” She put the question gently, almost cautiously.\n\nHe reflected a little. “Why--no,” he answered, as if reasoning to\nhimself. “Of course I'm not. This is what I've always wanted. It's my\nidea of life to a 't.' Only--I suppose everything needs a break in it\nnow and then--if only for the comfort of getting back into the old rut\nagain.”\n\n“The rut--yes,” she commented, musingly. “Apparently there's always a\nrut.”\n\nThorpe gave her the mystified yet uncomplaining glance she knew so well\nin his eyes. For once, the impulse to throw hidden things up into his\nrange of view prevailed with her.\n\n“Do you know,” she said, with a confused half-smile at the novelty of\nher mood for elucidation, “I fancied a rut was the one thing there could\nbe no question about with you. I had the notion that you were incapable\nof ruts--and conventional grooves. I thought you--as Carlyle puts it--I\nthought you were a man who had swallowed all the formulas.”\n\nThorpe looked down at his stomach doubtfully. “I see what you mean,” he\nsaid at last, but in a tone without any note of conviction.\n\n“I doubt it,” she told him, with light readiness--“for I don't see\nmyself what I mean. I forget indeed what it was I said. And so you think\nyou'll go up to town tonight?”\n\nA sudden comprehension of what was slipping away from his grasp aroused\nhim. “No--no,” he urged her, “don't forget what it was you said! I wish\nyou'd talk more with me about that. It was what I wanted to hear. You\nnever tell me what you're really thinking about.” She received the\nreproach with a mildly incredulous smile in her eyes. “Yes--I know--who\nwas it used to scold me about that? Oh”--she seemed suddenly reminded of\nsomething--“I was forgetting to mention it. I have a letter from Celia\nMadden. She is back in England; she is coming to us Saturday, too.”\n\nHe put out his lips a trifle. “That's all right,” he objected, “but what\nhas it got to do with what we were talking about?”\n\n“Talking about?” she queried, with a momentarily blank countenance. “Oh,\nshe used to bully me about my deceit, and treachery, and similar crimes.\nBut I shall be immensely glad to see her. I always fight with her, but I\nthink I like her better than any other woman alive.”\n\n“I like her too,” Thorpe was impelled to say, with a kind of solemnity.\n“She reminds me of some of the happiest hours in my life.”\n\nHis wife, after a brief glance into his face, laughed pleasantly, if\nwith a trace of flippancy. “You say nice things,” she observed, slightly\ninclining her head. “But now that Celia is coming, it would be as well\nto have another man. It's such dreadfully short notice, though.”\n\n“I daresay your father could come, all right,” Thorpe suggested. “I'd\nrather have him than almost anyone else. Would you mind asking him--or\nshall I?”\n\nAn abrupt silence marked this introduction of a subject upon which the\ncouple had differed openly. Thorpe, through processes unaccountable to\nhimself, had passed from a vivid dislike of General Kervick to a habit\nof mind in which he thoroughly enjoyed having him about. The General\nhad been twice to High Thorpe, and on each occasion had so prolonged\nhis stay that, in retrospect, the period of his absence seemed\ninconsiderable. The master now, thinking upon it in this minute of\nsilence, was conscious of having missed him greatly. He would not have\nbeen bored to the extremity of threatening to go to London, if Kervick\nhad been here. The General was a gentleman, and yet had the flexible\nadaptability of a retainer; he had been trained in discipline, and hence\nknew how to defer without becoming fulsome or familiar; he was a man of\nthe world and knew an unlimited number of racy stories, and even if he\nrepeated some of them unduly, they were better than no stories at all.\nAnd then, there was his matchless, unfailing patience in playing chess\nor backgammon or draughts or bezique, whatever he perceived that the\nmaster desired.\n\n“If you really wish it,” Edith said at last, coldly.\n\n“But that's what I don't understand,” Thorpe urged upon her with some\nvigour. “If I like him, I don't see why his own daughter----”\n\n“Oh, need we discuss it?” she broke in, impatiently. “If I'm an\nunnatural child, why then I am one, and may it not be allowed to pass\nat that?” A stormy kind of smile played upon her beautifully-cut lips\nas she added: “Surely one's filial emotions are things to be taken for\ngranted--relieved from the necessity of explanation.”\n\nThorpe grinned faintly at the hint of pleasantry, but he did not\nrelinquish his point. “Well--unless you really veto the thing--I think\nI'd like to tell him to come,” he said, with composed obstinacy. Upon\nan afterthought he added: “There's no reason why he shouldn't meet the\nDuke, is there?”\n\n“No specific reason,” she returned, with calm coolness of tone and\nmanner. “And certainly I do not see myself in the part of Madame Veto.”\n\n“All right then--I'll send him a wire,” said Thorpe. His victory made\nhim uneasy, yet he saw no way of abandoning it with decorum.\n\nAs the two, standing in a silence full of tacit constraint, looked\naimlessly away from the terrace, they saw at the same instant a vehicle\nwith a single horse coming rather briskly up the driveway, some hundreds\nof yards below. It was recognizable at once as the local trap from\nPunsey station, and as usual it was driven by a boy from the village.\nSeated beside this lad was a burly, red-bearded man in respectable\nclothes, who, to judge from the tin-box and travelling-bags fastened on\nbehind, seemed coming to High Thorpe to stay.\n\n“Who on earth is that?” asked Thorpe, wonderingly. The man was obviously\nof the lower class, yet there seemed something about him which invited\nrecognition.\n\n“Presumably it's the new head-gardener,” she replied with brevity.\n\nHer accent recalled to Thorpe the fact that there had been something\ndisagreeable in their conversation, and the thought of it was unpleasant\nto him. “Why, I didn't know you had a new man coming,” he said, turning\nto her with an overture of smiling interest.\n\n“Yes,” she answered, and then, as if weighing the proffered propitiation\nand rejecting it, turned slowly and went into the house.\n\nThe trap apparently ended its course at some back entrance: he did not\nsee it again. He strolled indoors, after a little, and told his man to\npack a bag for London, and order the stanhope to take him to the train.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nIN the early morning, long before any of the hotel people had made\nthemselves heard moving about, Thorpe got up.\n\nIt was a long time since he had liked himself and his surroundings so\nlittle. The bed seemed all right to the eye, and even to the touch, but\nhe had slept very badly in it, none the less. The room was luxuriously\nfurnished, as was the entire suite, but it was all strange and\nuncomfortable to his senses. The operation of shaving and dressing in\nsolitude produced an oppression of loneliness. He regretted not having\nbrought his man with him for this reason, and then, upon meditation, for\nother reasons. A person of his position ought always to have a servant\nwith him. The hotel people must have been surprised at his travelling\nunattended--and the people at High Thorpe must also have thought it\nstrange. It flashed across his mind that no doubt his wife had most of\nall thought it strange. How would she explain to herself his sudden,\nprecipitate journey to London alone? Might she not quite naturally\nput an unpleasant construction upon it? It was bad enough to have to\nremember that they had parted in something like a tiff; he found it much\nworse to be fancying the suspicions with which she would be turning over\nhis mysterious absence in her mind.\n\nHe went downstairs as speedily as possible and, discovering no overt\nsigns of breakfast in the vicinity of the restaurant, passed out and\nmade his way to the Embankment. This had been a favourite walk of his\nin the old days--but he considered it now with an unsympathetic eye. It\nseemed a dry and haggard and desolate-looking place by comparison with\nhis former impressions of it. The morning was grey-skied, but full of a\nhard quality of light, which brought out to the uncompromising uttermost\nthe dilapidated squalor of the Surrey side. The water was low, and\nfrom the mud and ooze of the ugly opposite shore, or perhaps from the\ndiscoloured stream itself, there proceeded a smell which offended his\nunaccustomed nostril. A fitful, gusty wind was blowing from the east,\nand ever and again it gathered dust in eddying swoops from the roadway,\nand flung it in his face.\n\nHe walked on toward the City, without any conscious purpose, and with\nno very definite reflections. It occurred to him that if his wife did\nimpute to him some unworthy motive in stealing off to London, and\nmade herself unhappy in doing so--that would at least provide the\ncompensation of showing that she cared. The thought, however, upon\nexamination, contained very meagre elements of solace. He could not in\nthe least be sure about any of the workings of her mind. There might be\nmore or less annoyance mixed up this morning with the secret thoughts\nshe had concerning him--or she might not be bothering her head about him\nat all. This latter contingency had never presented itself so frankly to\nhim before. He looked hard at it, and saw more semblances of probability\nabout it than he liked. It might very well be that she was not thinking\nabout him one way or the other.\n\nA depressing consciousness that practically nobody need think about him\npervaded his soul. Who cared what he said or did or felt? The City had\nforgotten his very existence. In the West End, only here and there some\nperson might chance to remember his name as that of some rich bounder\nwho had married Lady Cressage. Nowhere else in England, save one dull\nstrip of agricultural blankness in a backward home county, was there\na human being who knew anything whatever about him. And this was his\ncareer! It was for this that he had planned that memorable campaign, and\nwaged that amazing series of fortnightly battles, never missing victory,\nnever failing at any point of the complicated strategy, and crowning it\nall with a culminating triumph which had been the wonder and admiration\nof the whole financial world! A few score of menials or interested\ninferiors bowed to him; he drove some good horses, and was attentively\nwaited upon, and had a never-failing abundance of good things to eat and\ndrink aud smoke. Hardly anything more than that, when you came to think\nof it--and the passing usufruct of all these things could be enjoyed by\nany fool who had a ten-pound note in his pocket!\n\nWhat gross trick had the fates played on him? He had achieved power--and\nwhere was that power? What had he done with it? What COULD he do with\nit? He had an excess of wealth, it was true, but in what way could it\ncommand an excess of enjoyment? The very phrase was a paradox, as he\ndimly perceived. There existed only a narrow margin of advantage in\nfavour of the rich man. He could eat and drink a little more and a\nlittle better than the poor man; he could have better clothes, and lie\nabed later in the morning, and take life easier all round--but only\nwithin hard and fast bounds. There was an ascertained limit beyond which\nthe millionaire could no more stuff himself with food and wine than\ncould the beggar. It might be pleasant to take an added hour or two in\nbed in the morning, but to lie in bed all day would be an infliction. So\nit ran indefinitely--this thin selvedge of advantage which money\ncould buy--with deprivation on the one side, and surfeit on the other.\nCandidly, was it not true that more happiness lay in winning the way out\nof deprivation, than in inventing safeguards against satiety? The\npoor man succeeding in making himself rich--at numerous stages of the\noperation there might be made a moral snap-shot of the truly happy man.\nBut not after he had reached the top. Then disintegration began at once.\nThe contrast between what he supposed he could do, and what he finds it\npossible to do, is too vast to be accepted with equanimity.\n\nIt must be said that after breakfast--a meal which he found in an\nItalian restaurant of no great cleanliness or opulence of pretension,\nand ate with an almost novel relish--Thorpe took somewhat less gloomy\nviews of his position. He still walked eastward, wandering into\nwarehouse and shipping quarters skirting the river, hitherto quite\nunknown to him, and pursuing in an idle, inconsequent fashion his\nmeditations. He established in his mind the proposition that since an\nexcess of enjoyment was impossible--since one could not derive a great\nblock of happiness from the satisfaction of the ordinary appetites, but\nat the most could only gather a little from each--the desirable thing\nwas to multiply as much as might be those tastes and whims and fancies\nwhich passed for appetites, and thus expand the area of possible\ngratification.\n\nThis seemed very logical indeed, but it did not apply itself to his\nindividual needs with much facility. What did he want to do that he had\nnot done? It was difficult for him to say. Perhaps it was chandlers'\nsigns and windows about him, and the indefinable seafaring preoccupation\nsuggested by the high-walled, narrow streets, which raised the question\nof a yacht in his mind. Did he want a yacht? He could recall having once\ndwelt with great fondness upon such a project: doubtless it would still\nbe full of attractions for him. He liked the water, and the water\nliked him--and he was better able now than formerly to understand how\nluxurious existence can be made in modern private ships. He decided that\nhe would have a yacht--and then perceived that the decision brought no\nexhilaration. He was no happier than before. He could decide that he\nwould have anything he chose to name--and it would in no whit lighten\nhis mood. The yacht might be as grand as High Thorpe, and relatively as\nspacious and well ordered, but would he not grow as tired of the one as\nhe had of the other?\n\nHe stopped short at this blunt self-expression of something he had never\nadmitted to himself. Was he indeed tired of High Thorpe? He had assured\nhis wife to the contrary yesterday. He reiterated the assurance to his\nown mind now. It was instead that he was tired of himself. He carried\na weariness about with him, which looked at everything with apathetic\neyes, and cared for nothing. Some nameless paralysis had settled upon\nhis capacity for amusement and enjoyment, and atrophied it. He had\nhad the power to expand his life to the farthest boundaries of rich\nexperience and sensation, and he had deliberately shrunk into a sort of\nherbaceous nonentity, whom nobody knew or cared about. He might have had\nLondon at his beck and call, and yet of all that the metropolis might\nmean to a millionaire, he had been able to think of nothing better than\nthat it should send old Kervick to him, to help beguile his boredom with\ndominoes and mess-room stories! Pah! He was disgusted with himself.\n\nStriking out a new course, with the Monument as his guide, he presently\ncame into a part of the City which had a certain familiarity for him.\nHe walked up St. Swithin's Lane, looking at the strange forms of foreign\nfruit exposed at the shop-doors, and finding in them some fleeting\nrecurrence of the hint that travel was what he needed. Then he stopped,\nto look through the railings and open gateway at an enclosure on the\nleft, and the substantial, heavily-respectable group of early Victorian\nbuildings beyond. Some well-dressed men were standing talking in one of\nthe porches. The stiff yellowish-stucco pilasters of this entrance, and\nthe tall uniformed figure of the porter in the shadow, came into the\npicture as he observed it; they gave forth a suggestion of satisfied\nsmugness--of orderly but altogether unillumined routine. Nothing could\nbe more commonplace to the eye.\n\nYet to his imagination, eighteen months before, what mysterious marvels\nof power had lurked hidden behind those conventional portals! Within\nthose doors, in some inner chamber, sat men whose task it was to direct\nthe movements of the greatest force the world had ever known. They and\ntheir cousins in Paris and Frankfort, or wherever they lived, between\nthem wielded a vaster authority than all the Parliaments of the earth.\nThey could change a government, or crush the aspirations of a whole\npeople, or decide a question of peace or war, by the silent dictum of\ntheir little family council. He remembered now how he had stood on this\nsame spot, and stared with fascinated gaze at this quadrangle of dull\nhouses, and pondered upon what it must feel like to be a Rothschild--and\nthat was only a little over a year ago!\n\nThere was no sense of fascination whatever in his present gaze. He found\nhimself regarding instead, with a kind of detached curiosity, the\nlittle knot of men in frock-coats and silk-hats who stood talking in the\ndoorway. It was barely ten o'clock, yet clearly business was proceeding\nwithin. One of these persons whom he beheld might be a Rothschild, for\naught he knew; at any rate, it was presumable that some of them were\non the premises. He had heard it said that the very head of the house\nlistened to quotations from the tape while he ate his luncheon, and\ninterrupted his conversations with the most important of non-commercial\ncallers, to make or refuse bargains in shares offered by brokers who\ncame in. What impulse lay behind this extraordinary devotion to labour?\nToward what conceivable goal could it be striving?\n\nTo work hard and risk great things for the possession of a fortune, in\norder to enjoy it afterward--he could understand how that attracted\nmen. But to possess already the biggest of human fortunes, and still\nwork--that baffled him. He wished he knew some of those men in there,\nespecially if they belonged to the place. It would be wonderfully\ninteresting to get at the inner point of view of New Court.\n\nA little later, in Colin Semple's office, he sat down to await the\ncoming of that gentleman. “Then he doesn't get here so early nowadays?”\n he suggested to the head-clerk who, with instant recognition and\nexaggerated deference, had ushered him into this furthermost private\nroom. It pleased him to assume that prosperity had relaxed the\nScotchman's vigilance.\n\n“Oh yes, sir,” the clerk replied. “A bit earlier if anything, as a rule.\nBut I think he is stopping at his solicitors on his way to the City. I\nhope you are very well, sir.”\n\n“Yes--I'm very fit--thanks,” Thorpe said, listlessly, and the other left\nhim.\n\nMr. Semple, when at last he arrived, bustled into the room with\nunaffected gratification at the news he had heard without. “Well, well,\nThorpe man!” he cried, and shook hands cordially. “This is fine! If\nI'd only known you were in town! Why wouldn't you have told me you were\ncoming? I'd never have kept you waiting.”\n\nThorpe laughed wearily. “I hardly knew I was in town myself. I only ran\nup last night. I thought it would amuse me to have a look round--but\nthings seem as dull as ditchwater.”\n\n“Oh no,” said Semple, “the autumn is opening verra well indeed. There\nare more new companies, and a better public subscription all round, than\nfor any first week of October I remember. Westralians appear bad on\nthe face of things, it's true--but don't believe all you hear of them.\nThere's more than the suspicion of a 'rig' there. Besides, you haven't a\npenny in them.”\n\n“I wasn't thinking of that,” Thorpe told him, with comprehensive\nvagueness. “Well, I suppose you're still coining money,” he observed,\nafter a pause.\n\n“Keeping along--keeping along,” the broker replied, cheerfully. “I canna\ncomplain.” Thorpe looked at him with a meditative frown. “Well, what are\nyou going to do with it, after you've got it?” he demanded, almost with\nsharpness.\n\nThe Scotchman, after a surprised instant, smiled. “Oh, I'll just keep my\nhands on it,” he assured him, lightly.\n\n“That isn't what I mean,” Thorpe said, groping after what he did\nmean, with sullen tenacity, among his thoughts. His large, heavy face\nexhibited a depressed gravity which attracted the other's attention.\n\n“What's the matter?” Semple asked quickly. “Has anything gone wrong with\nyou?”\n\nThorpe slowly shook his head. “What better off do you think you'll be\nwith six figures than you are with five?” he pursued, with dogmatic\ninsistence.\n\nSemple shrugged his shoulders. He seemed to have grown much brighter\nand gayer of mood in this past twelvemonth. Apparently he was somewhat\nstouter, and certainly there was a mellowed softening of his sharp\nglance and shrewd smile. It was evident that his friend's mood somewhat\nnonplussed him, but his good-humour was unflagging.\n\n“It's the way we're taught at school,” he hazarded, genially. “In all\nthe arithmetics six beats five, and seven beats six.”\n\n“They're wrong,” Thorpe declared, and then consented to laugh in a\ngrudging, dogged way at his friend's facial confession of puzzlement.\n“What I mean is--what's the good of piling up money, while you can't\npile up the enjoyments it will buy? What will a million give you, that\nthe fifth of it, or the tenth of it, won't give you just as well?”\n\n“Aye,” said Semple, with a gleam of comprehension in his glance. “So\nyou've come to that frame of mind, have you? Why does a man go on and\nshoot five hundred pheasants, when he can eat only one?”\n\n“Oh, if you like the mere making of money, I've nothing more to say,”\n Thorpe responded, with a touch of resentment. “I've always thought of\nyou as a man like myself, who wanted to make his pile and then enjoy\nhimself.”\n\nThe Scotchman laughed joyously. “Enjoy myself! Like you!” he cried.\n“Man, you're as doleful as a mute at a laird's funeral! What's come over\nyou? I know what it is. You go and take a course of German waters----”\n\n“Oh, that be damned!” Thorpe objected, gloomily. “I tell you I'm all\nright. Only--only--God! I've a great notion to go and get drunk.”\n\nColin Semple viewed his companion with a more sympathetic expression.\n“I'm sorry you're so hipped,” he said, in gentle tones. “It can't be\nmore than some passing whimsy. You're in no real trouble, are you?--no\nfamily trouble?”\n\nThorpe shook his head. “The whole thing is rot!” he affirmed,\nenigmatically.\n\n“What whole thing?” The broker perched on the edge of his desk, and with\npatient philosophy took him up. “Do you mean eighty thousand a year is\nrot? That depends upon the man who has it.”\n\n“I know that well enough,” broke in the other, heavily. “That's what I'm\nkicking about. I'm no good!”\n\nSemple, looking attentively down upon him, pursed his lips in\nreflection. “That's not the case,” he observed with argumentative\ncalmness. “You're a great deal of good. I'm not so sure that what you've\nbeen trying to do is any good, though. Come!--I read you like large\nprint. You've set out to live the life of a rich country squire--and it\nhasn't come off. It couldn't come off! I never believed it would. You\nhaven't the taste for it inbred in your bones. You haven't the thousand\nlittle habits and interests that they take in with their mother's milk,\nand that make such a life possible. When you look at a hedge, you don't\nthink of it as something to worry live animals out of. When you see one\nof your labourers, you don't care who his father was, or which dairymaid\nhis uncle ought to have married, if he had wanted to get a certain\ncottage. You don't want to know the name of everybody whose roof you can\nsee; much less could you remember them, and talk about them, and listen\nto gossip about them, year after year. It isn't a passion in your blood\nto ride to hounds, and to shoot, and all that. It doesn't come to you\nby tradition--and you haven't the vacancy of mind which might be a\nsubstitute for tradition. What are you doing in the country, then? Just\neating too much, and sitting about, and getting fat and stupid. If you\nwant the truth, there it is for you.”\n\nThorpe, putting out his lips judicially, inclined upon reflection to the\nview that this was the truth. “That's all right, as far as it goes,” he\nassented, with hesitation. “But what the hell else is there?”\n\nThe little Scotchman had grown too interested in his diagnosis to drop\nit in an incomplete state. “A year ago,” he went on, “you had won your\nvictories like a veritable Napoleon. You had everything in your own\nhands; Napoleon himself was not more the master of what he saw about\nhim than you were. And then what did you do? You voluntarily retired\nyourself to your Elba. It wasn't that you were beaten and driven there\nby others; you went of your own accord. Have you ever thought, Thorpe,\nof this? Napoleon was the greatest man of his age--one of the greatest\nmen of all ages--not only in war but in a hundred other ways. He spent\nthe last six years of his life at St. Helena--in excellent health and\nwith companions that he talked freely to--and in all the extraordinarily\ncopious reports of his conversations there, we don't get a single\nsentence worth repeating. If you read it, you'll see he talked like a\ndull, ordinary body. The greatness had entirely evaporated from him, the\nmoment he was put on an island where he had nothing to do.”\n\n“Yes-s,” said Thorpe, thoughtfully. He accepted the application without\nany qualms about the splendour of the comparison it rested upon. He had\ndone the great things, just as Semple said, and there was no room for\nfalse modesty about them in his mind. “The trouble is,” he began, “that\nI did what I had always thought I wanted to do most. I was quite certain\nin my mind that that was what I wanted. And if we say now that I was\nwrong--if we admit that that wasn't what I really wanted--why then, God\nknows what it is I DO want. I'll be hanged if I do!”\n\n“Come back to the City,” Semple told him. “That's where you belong.”\n\n“No--no!” Thorpe spoke with emphasis. “That's where you're all off. I\ndon't belong in the City at all. I hate the whole outfit. What the devil\namusement would it be to me to take other men's money away from them?\nI'd be wanting all the while to give it back to them. And certainly I\nwouldn't get any fun out of their taking my money away from me. Besides,\nit doesn't entertain me. I've no taste at all for it. I never look at a\nfinancial paper now. I could no more interest myself in all that stuff\nagain than I could fly. That's the hell of it--to be interested in\nanything.”\n\n“Go in for politics,” the other suggested, with less warmth.\n\n“Yes, I know,” Thorpe commented, with a lingering tone. “Perhaps I ought\nto think more about that. By the way, what's Plowden doing? I've lost\nall track of him.”\n\n“Abroad somewhere, I fancy,” Semple replied. His manner exhibited a\nprofound indifference. “When his mother died he came into something--I\ndon't know how much. I don't think I've seen him since--and that must\nhave been six months and more ago.”\n\n“Yes. I heard about it at the time,” the other said. “It must be about\nthat. His sister and brother--the young Plowdens--they're coming to us\nat the end of the week, I believe. You didn't hit it off particularly\nwith Plowden, eh?”\n\nSemple emitted a contemptuous little laugh. “I did not quarrel with\nhim--if you mean that,” he said, “but even to please you, Thorpe, I\ncouldn't bring myself to put my back into the job of making money for\nhim. He was treated fairly--even generously, d'ye mind. I should think,\nall told, he had some thirty thousand pounds for his shares, and that's\na hundred times as much as I had a pleasure in seeing him get. Each man\ncan wear his own parasites, but it's a task for him to stand another\nman's. I shook your Lord Plowden off, when the chance came.”\n\n“THAT'S all right,” Thorpe assured him, easily. “I never told you that\nhe was any good. I merely felt like giving him a leg up--because really\nat the start he was of use to me. I did owe him something....It was at\nhis house that I met my wife.”\n\n“Aye,” said Semple, with dispassionate brevity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nWHEN he had parted with Semple, at a corner where the busy broker, who\nhad walked out with him, obviously fidgeted to get away, Thorpe could\nthink of no one else in the City whom he desired to see. A call upon\nhis bankers would, he knew, be made an occasion of extremely pleasant\ncourtesy by those affable people, but upon reflection it seemed scarcely\nworth the trouble.\n\nHe was in a mood for indolent sauntering, and he made the long stretch\nof the Holborn thoroughfare in a leisurely fashion, turning off when\nthe whim seized him into odd courts and alley-ways to see what they were\nlike. After luncheon, he continued his ramble, passing at last from\nSt. Giles, through avenues which had not existed in the London of his\nboyhood, to the neighbourhood of the Dials. Here also the landmarks\nseemed all changed, but there was still enough ostentatious squalor and\ndisorder to identify the district. He observed it and its inhabitants\nwith a certain new curiosity. A notable alteration for the better had\ncome over his spirits. It might be the champagne at luncheon, or it\nmight be the mere operation of a frank talk with Semple, that had\ndissipated his gloom. At all events it was gone--and he strolled along\nin quite placid contentment, taking in the panorama of London's more\nintimate life with the interest of a Londoner who has obtained a fresh\ncountry eye.\n\nHe who had seen most of the world, and not cared much about the\nspectacle, found himself now consciously enjoying observation as he had\nnot supposed it possible to do. He surrendered himself to the experience\nwith a novel sense of having found something worth while--and found it,\nmoreover, under his very nose. In some dull, meaningless fashion he had\nalways known this part of London, and been familiar with its external\naspects. Now suddenly he perceived that the power had come to him of\nseeing it all in a different way. The objects he beheld, inanimate\nand otherwise, had specific new meanings for him. His mind was stirred\npleasurably by the things they said to him.\n\nHe looked at all the contents of the windows as he passed; at the\nbarrows of the costers and hawkers crowding up the side-streets; at\nthe coarse-haired, bare-headed girls and women standing about in their\nshawls and big white aprons; at the weakling babies in their arms or\nabout the thick, clumsy folds of their stained skirts; at the grimy,\nshuffling figures of their men-folk, against the accustomed background\nof the public-house corner, with its half-open door, and its fly-blown\ntheatre-bills in the windows; at the drivers of the vans and carts,\nsleepily overlooking the huge horses, gigantic to the near view as some\nsurvival from the age of mammoths, which pushed gingerly, ploddingly,\ntheir tufted feet over the greasy stones; at foul interiors where\nthrough the blackness one discerned bent old hags picking over refuse;\nat the faces which, as he passed, made some special human appeal to\nhim--faces blurred with drink, faces pallid with under-feeding,\nfaces worn into masks by the tension of trouble, faces sweetened by\nresignation, faces aglow with devil-may-care glee...he looked, as it\nwere, into the pulsing heart of something which had scarcely seemed\nalive to him before.\n\nEventually, he found himself halting at the door of his sister's\nbook-shop. A new boy stood guard over the stock exposed on the shelf and\nstands outside, and he looked stonily at the great man; it was evident\nthat he was as far from suspecting his greatness as his relationship.\nIt pleased Thorpe for a little to take up one book after another, and\npretend to read from it, and force the boy to watch him hard. He had\nalmost the temptation to covertly slip a volume into his pocket, and\nsee what the lad would do. It was remarkable, he reflected with\nsatisfaction--this new capacity within him to find drama in trifles.\n\nThere floated into his mind the recollection of some absurd squabble he\nhad had with his sister about the sign overhead. He stepped back a\nfew paces and looked up at it. There were the old words--“Thorpe,\nBookseller”--right enough, but they seemed to stand forth with a\nnovel prominence. Upon a second glance, he saw that the board had been\nrepainted. At this he laughed aloud. The details of the episode came\nback to him now. For some reason, or no reason at all--he could not now\nimagine what on earth could have prompted him--he had last spring caused\nhis sister to be informed of his wish that her own name, Dabney, should\nbe substituted for that of Thorpe on her sign. It was to Julia that he\nhad confided this mission, and it was Julia who, in a round-about\nway, had disclosed to him presently her mother's deep resolution to do\nnothing of the sort. He laughed again at the added defiance that this\nrefurbishing of the old sign expressed, and still was grinning broadly\nas he entered the shop and pushed his way along to the rear.\n\nShe stood beside her desk as she seemed to have stood ever since he\ncould remember her--tall, placid, dull-eyed, self-sufficient, exhaling\nas it were a kind of stubborn yet competent listlessness. Her long,\nmannish countenance expressed an undoubted interest in his presence,\nwhen she recognized him, but he had no clear perception whether it was\npleased or otherwise. In their infrequent latter-day encounters he had\ndropped the habit of kissing her, and there was certainly no hint in\nher manner of expecting, much less inviting, its renewal now--but upon\na sudden impulse he drew her to him with an arm flung round her gaunt\nwaist, smacked his lips with effusion upon her cheek.\n\nHer surprise, as she withdrew herself somewhat forcefully from his\nembrace, was plain enough. “Well!” she exclaimed vaguely, and then\nlooked at him. “You're getting fatter.”\n\n“No I'm not,” he rejoined, with the earnestness belonging to an\nimportant topic. “People think I am--but it's merely the looseness of\nthese clothes. There's really no difference since I was here last.”\n\nThe glance they exchanged was so full of the tacit comment that this\nlast visit was a long time ago, that Thorpe put it into words. “Let's\nsee--that was just before Christmas, wasn't it?” he said.\n\n“Something like that,” she responded. “You were going to get married\nin a week or two, I remember, and THAT was in January, wasn't it? I was\ntaking stock, I know.”\n\nHe nodded in turn. The thought that his only sister recalled his\nmarriage merely as a date, like a royal anniversary or a bank-holiday,\nand held herself implacably aloof from all contact with his domestic\nlife, annoyed him afresh. “You're an awful goat, not to come near us,”\n he felt impelled, in brotherly frankness, to tell her.\n\nShe put out her lips, and wagged her head a little, in a gesture which\nit flashed across him his own mirror might often have recorded. “I\nthought that was all settled and done with long ago,” she said, moodily.\n\n“Oh, I won't worry you with it, Lou,” he observed, with reassuring\nkindness of tone. “I never felt so much like being nice to you in my\nlife.”\n\nShe seemed surprised at this, too, and regarded him with a heavy new\nfixity of gaze. No verbal comment, apparently, occurred to her.\n\n“Julia and Alfred all right?” he queried, cheerfully.\n\n“I daresay,” she made brief answer.\n\n“But they write to you, don't they?”\n\n“SHE does--sometimes. They seem to be doing themselves very well, from\nwhat she says.”\n\n“She'd write oftener, if you'd answer her letters,” he told her, in\ntones of confidential reproach.\n\n“Oh, I don't write letters unless I've got something to say,” she\nanswered, as if the explanation were ample.\n\nThe young people were domiciled for the time being at Dusseldorf,\nwhere Alfred had thought he would most like to begin his Continental\nstudent-career, and where Julia, upon the more or less colourable\npretext of learning the language, might enjoy the mingled freedom and\noccupation of a home of her own. They had taken a house for the summer\nand autumn, and would do the same in Dresden or Munich, later on, for\nthe winter.\n\n“What I would really have liked,” Thorpe confided to his sister now,\n“was to have had them both live with me. They would have been as welcome\nas the day is long. I could see, of course, in Alfred's case, that if\nhe's set on being an artist, he ought to study abroad. Even the best\nEnglish artists, he says, do that at the beginning. So it was all right\nfor him to go. But Julia--it was different with her--I was rather keen\nabout her staying. My wife was just as keen as I was. She took the\ngreatest fancy to Julia from the very start--and so far as I could\nsee, Julia liked her all right. In fact, I thought Julia would want to\nstay--but somehow she didn't.”\n\n“She always spoke very highly of your wife,” Mrs. Dabney affirmed with\njudicial fairness. “I think she does like her very much.”\n\n“Well then what did she want to hyke off to live among those Dutchmen\nfor, when one of the best houses in England was open to her?” Thorpe\ndemanded.\n\n“You mustn't ask me,” her mother responded. Her tone seemed to carry\nthe suggestion that by silence she could best protect her daughter's\ninterests.\n\n“I don't believe you know any more about it than I do,” was his\nimpulsive comment.\n\n“I daresay not,” she replied, with indifference. “Probably she didn't\nfancy living in so big a house--although heaven knows her ideas are big\nenough about most things.”\n\n“Did she say so?” Thorpe asked abruptly.\n\nThe widow shook her head with dispassionate candour. “She didn't\nsay anything to me about it, one way or the other. I formed my own\nimpressions--that's all. It's a free country. Everybody can form their\nimpressions.”\n\n“I wish you'd tell me what you really think,” Thorpe urged her, mildly\npersuasive. “You know how fond I am of Julia, and how little I want to\ndo her an injustice.”\n\n“Oh, she wouldn't feel THAT way,” Louisa observed, vaguely. “If you ask\nme plain, I think it was dull for her.”\n\n“Well,” said Thorpe, upon reflection, “I shouldn't be surprised if it\nwas. I hadn't thought of that. But still--why she and my wife could be\ncompany for each other.”\n\n“You talk as if life was merely a long railway journey,” she told him,\nin an unexpected flight of metaphor. “Two women cooped up in a lonesome\ncountry house may be a little less lonely than one of them by herself\nwould be--but not much. It's none of my business--but how your wife must\nhate it!”\n\nHe laughed easily. “Ah, that's where you're wrong,” he said. “She\ndoesn't care about anything but gardening. That's her hobby. She's crazy\nabout it. We've laid out more in new greenhouses alone, not counting\nthe plants, than would rebuild this building. I'm not sure the heating\napparatus wouldn't come to that, alone. And then the plants! What do\nyou think of six and eight guineas for a single root? Those are the\namaryllises--and if you come to orchids, you can pay hundreds if you\nlike. Well, that's her passion. That's what she really loves.”\n\n“That's what she seizes upon to keep her from just dying of loneliness,”\n Louisa retorted, obstinately, and at a sign of dissent from her brother\nshe went on. “Oh, I know what I'm talking about. I have three or four\ncustomers--ladies in the country, and one of them is a lady of title,\ntoo--and they order gardening books and other books through me, and when\nthey get up to town, once a year or so, they come here and they talk to\nme about it. And there isn't one of them that at the bottom of her heart\ndoesn't hate it. They'd rather dodge busses at Charing Cross corner all\nday long, than raise flowers as big as cheeses, if they had their own\nway. But they don't have their own way, and they must have something to\noccupy themselves with--and they take to gardening. I daresay I'd even\ndo it myself if I had to live in the country, which thank God I don't!”\n\n“That's because you don't know anything about the country,” he told her,\nbut the retort, even while it justified itself, had a hollow sound in\nhis own ears. “All you know outside of London is Margate.”\n\n“I went to Yarmouth and Lowestoft this summer,” she informed him,\ncrushingly.\n\nSomehow he lacked the heart to laugh. “I know what you mean, Lou,” he\nsaid, with an affectionate attempt at placation. “I suppose there's a\ngood deal in what you say. It is dull, out there at my place, if you\nhave too much of it. Perhaps that's a good hint about my wife. It never\noccurred to me, but it may be so. But the deuce of it is, what else is\nthere to do? We tried a house in London, during the Season----”\n\n“Yes, I saw in the papers you were here,” she said impassively, in\ncomment upon his embarrassed pause.\n\n“I didn't look you up, because I didn't think you wanted much to see\nme”--he explained with a certain awkwardness--“but bye-gones are all\nbye-gones. We took a town house, but we didn't like it. It was one\nendless procession of stupid and tiresome calls and dinners and parties;\nwe got awfully sick of it, and swore we wouldn't try it again. Well\nthere you are, don't you see? It's stupid in Hertfordshire, and it's\nstupid here. Of course one can travel abroad, but that's no good\nfor more than a few months. Of course it would be different if I had\nsomething to do. I tell you God's truth, Lou--sometimes I feel as if I\nwas really happier when I was a poor man. I know it's all rot--I really\nwasn't--but sometimes it SEEMS as if I was.”\n\nShe contemplated him with a leaden kind of gaze. “Didn't it ever occur\nto you to do some good with your money?” she said, with slow bluntness.\nThen, as if fearing a possible misconception, she added more rapidly: “I\ndon't mean among your own family. We're a clannish people, we Thorpes;\nwe'd always help our own flesh and blood, even if we kicked them while\nwe were doing it--but I mean outside, in the world at large.”\n\n“What have I got to do with the world at large? I didn't make it; I'm\nnot responsible for it.” He muttered the phrases lightly enough, but a\ncertain fatuity in them seemed to attract his attention when he heard\ntheir sound. “I've given between five and six thousand pounds to London\nhospitals within the present year,” he added, straightening himself. “I\nwonder you didn't see it. It was in all the papers.”\n\n“Hospitals!”\n\nIt was impossible to exaggerate the scorn which her voice imported into\nthe word. He looked at her with unfeigned surprise, and then took in the\nimpression that she was upon a subject which exceptionally interested\nher. Certainly the display of something approaching animation in her\nglance and manner was abnormal.\n\n“I said 'do some GOOD with your money,'” she reminded him, still with a\nvibration of feeling in her tone. “You must live in the country, if\nyou think London hospitals are deserving objects. They couldn't fool\nLondoners on that point, not if they had got the Prince to go on his\nhands and knees. And you give a few big cheques to them,” she went on,\nmeditatively, “and you never ask how they're managed, or what rings are\nrunning them for their own benefit, or how your money is spent--and you\nthink you've done a noble, philanthropic thing! Oh no--I wasn't talking\nabout humbug charity. I was talking about doing some genuine good in the\nworld.”\n\nHe put his leg over the high stool, and pushed his hat back with a\nsmile. “All right,” he said, genially. “What do you propose?”\n\n“I don't propose anything,” she told him, after a moment's hesitation.\n“You must work that out for yourself. What might seem important to\nme might not interest you at all--and if you weren't interested you\nwouldn't do anything. But this I do say to you, Joel--and I've said it\nto myself every day for this last year or more, and had you in mind all\nthe time, too--if I had made a great fortune, and I sat about in\npurple and fine linen doing nothing but amuse myself in idleness and\nselfishness, letting my riches accumulate and multiply themselves\nwithout being of use to anybody, I should be ASHAMED to look my\nfellow-creatures in the face! You were born here. You know what London\nslums are like. You know what Clare Market was like--it's bad enough\nstill--and what the Seven Dials and Drury Lane and a dozen other places\nround here are like to this day. That's only within a stone's throw.\nHave you seen Charles Booth's figures about the London poor? Of course\nyou haven't--and it doesn't matter. You KNOW what they are like. But you\ndon't care. The misery and ignorance and filth and hopelessness of two\nor three hundred thousand people doesn't interest you. You sit upon your\nmoney-bags and smile. If you want the truth, I'm ashamed to have you for\na brother!”\n\n“Well, I'm damned!” was Thorpe's delayed and puzzled comment upon this\noutburst. He looked long at his sister, in blank astonishment. “Since\nwhen have you been taken this way?” he asked at last, mechanically\njocular.\n\n“That's all right,” she declared with defensive inconsequence. “It's the\nway I feel. It's the way I've felt from the beginning.”\n\nHe was plainly surprised out of his equanimity by this unlooked-for\ndemonstration on his sister's part. He got off the stool and walked\nabout in the little cleared space round the desk. When he spoke, it was\nto utter something which he could trace to no mental process of which he\nhad been conscious.\n\n“How do you know that that isn't what I've felt too--from the\nbeginning?” he demanded of her, almost with truculence. “You say I sit\non my money-bags and smile--you abuse me with doing no good with my\nmoney--how do you know I haven't been studying the subject all this\nwhile, and making my plans, and getting ready to act? You never did\nbelieve in me!”\n\nShe sniffed at him. “I don't believe in you now, at all events,” she\nsaid, bluntly.\n\nHe assumed the expression of a misunderstood man. “Why, this very\nday”--he began, and again was aware that thoughts were coming\nup, ready-shaped to his tongue, which were quite strangers to his\nbrain--“this whole day I've been going inch by inch over the very ground\nyou mention; I've been on foot since morning, seeing all the corners and\nalleys of that whole district for myself, watching the people and the\nthings they buy and the way they live--and thinking out my plans for\ndoing something. I don't claim any credit for it. It seems to me no more\nthan what a man in my position ought to do. But I own that to come in,\nactually tired out from a tramp like that, and get blown-up by one's\nown sister for selfishness and heartlessness and miserliness and all the\nrest of it--I must say, that's a bit rum.”\n\nLouisa did not wince under this reproach as she might have been expected\nto do, nor was there any perceptible amelioration in the heavy frown\nwith which she continued to regard him. But her words, uttered after\nsome consideration, came in a tone of voice which revealed a desire to\navoid offense. “It won't matter to you, your getting blown-up by me, if\nyou're really occupying your mind with that sort of thing. You're too\nused to it for that.”\n\nHe would have liked a less cautious acceptance of his assurances than\nthis--but after all, one did not look to Louisa for enthusiasms. The\ndepth of feeling she had disclosed on this subject of London's poor\nstill astonished him, but principally now because of its unlikely\nsource. If she had been notoriously of an altruistic and free-handed\ndisposition, he could have understood it. But she had been always the\nhard, dry, unemotional one; by comparison with her, he felt himself\nto be a volatile and even sentimental person. If she had such views\nas these, it became clear to him that his own views were even much\nadvanced.\n\n“It's a tremendous subject,” he said, with loose largeness of manner.\n“Only a man who works hard at it can realize how complicated it is. The\nonly way is to start with the understanding that something is going\nto be done. No matter how many difficulties there are in the way,\nSOMETHING'S GOING TO BE DONE! If a strong man starts out with that, why\nthen he can fight his way through, and push the difficulties aside or\nbend them to suit his purpose, and accomplish something.”\n\nMrs. Dabney, listening to this, found nothing in it to quarrel with--yet\nsomehow remained, if not skeptical, then passively unconvinced. “What\nare your plans?” she asked him.\n\n“Oh, it's too soon to formulate anything,” he told her, with prepared\nreadiness. “It isn't a thing to rush into in a hurry, with half baked\ntheories and limited information. Great results, permanent results, are\nnever obtained that way.”\n\n“I hope it isn't any Peabody model-dwelling thing.”\n\n“Oh, nothing like it in the least,” he assured her, and made a mental\nnote to find out what it was she had referred to.\n\n“The Lord-Rowton houses are better, they say,” she went on, “but it\nseems to me that the real thing is that there shouldn't be all this\nimmense number of people with only fourpence or fivepence in their\npocket. That's where the real mischief lies.”\n\nHe nodded comprehendingly, but hesitated over further words. Then\nsomething occurred to him. “Look here!” he said. “If you're as keen\nabout all this, are you game to give up this footling old shop, and\ndevote your time to carrying out my plans, when I've licked 'em into\nshape?”\n\nShe began shaking her head, but then something seemed also to occur to\nher. “It'll be time enough to settle that when we get to it, won't it?”\n she observed.\n\n“No--you've got to promise me now,” he told her.\n\n“Well that I won't!” she answered, roundly.\n\n“You'd see the whole--the whole scheme come to nothing, would you?”--he\nscolded at her--“rather than abate a jot of your confounded mulishness.”\n\n“Aha!” she commented, with a certain alertness of perception shining\nthrough the stolidity of her mien. “I knew you were humbugging! If\nyou'd meant what you said, you wouldn't talk about its coming to nothing\nbecause I won't do this or that. I ought to have known better. I'm\nalways a goose when I believe what you tell me.”\n\nA certain abstract justice in her reproach impressed him. “No you're\nnot, Lou,” he replied, coaxingly. “I really mean it all--every word of\nit--and more. It only occurred to me that it would all go better, if you\nhelped. Can't you understand how I should feel that?”\n\nShe seemed in a grudging way to accept anew his professions of\nsincerity, but she resisted all attempts to extract any promise. “I\ndon't believe in crossing a bridge till I get to it,” she declared,\nwhen, on the point of his departure, he last raised the question, and it\nhad to be left at that. He took with him some small books she had tied\nin a parcel, and told him to read. She had spoken so confidently of\ntheir illuminating value, that he found himself quite committed to their\nperusal--and almost to their endorsement. He had thought during the day\nof running down to Newmarket, for the Cesarewitch was to be run on the\nmorrow, and someone had told him that that was worth seeing. By the time\nhe reached his hotel, however, an entirely new project had possessed his\nmind. He packed his bag, and took the next train for home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\n“I DIDN'T ask your father, after all,” was one of the things that\nThorpe said to his wife next day. He had the manner of one announcing\na concession, albeit in an affable spirit, and she received the remark\nwith a scant, silent nod.\n\nTwo days later he recurred to the subject. They were again upon the\nterrace, where he had been lounging in an easy-chair most of the day,\nwith the books his sister had bid him read on a table beside him. He had\nglanced through some of them in a desultory fashion, cutting pages at\nrandom here and there, but for the most part he had looked straight\nbefore him at the broad landscape, mellowing now into soft browns and\nyellows under the mild, vague October sun. He had not thought much of\nthe books, but he had a certain new sense of enjoyment in the fruits\nof this placid, abstracted rumination which perhaps they had helped to\ninduce.\n\n“About your father,” he said now, as his wife, who had come out to speak\nwith him on some other matter, was turning to go away again: “I'm afraid\nI annoyed you the other day by what I said.”\n\n“I have no recollection of it,” she told him, with tranquil politeness,\nover her shoulder.\n\nHe found himself all at once keenly desirous of a conversation on this\ntopic. “But I want you to recollect,” he said, as he rose to his\nfeet. There was a suggestion of urgency in his tone which arrested her\nattention. She moved slowly toward the chair, and after a little perched\nherself upon one of its big arms, and looked up at him where he leant\nagainst the parapet.\n\n“I've thought of it a good deal,” he went on, in halting explanation.\nHis purpose seemed clearer to him than were the right phrases in which\nto define it. “I persisted in saying that I'd do something you didn't\nwant me to do--something that was a good deal more your affair than\nmine--and I've blamed myself for it. That isn't at all what I want to\ndo.”\n\nHer face as well as her silence showed her to be at a loss for\nan appropriate comment. She was plainly surprised, and seemingly\nembarrassed as well. “I'm sure you always wish to be nice,” she said at\nlast. The words and tone were alike gracious, but he detected in them\nsomewhere a perfunctory note.\n\n“Oh--nice!” he echoed, in a sudden stress of impatience with the word.\n“Damn being 'nice'! Anybody can be 'nice.' I'm thinking of something ten\nthousand times bigger than being 'nice.'”\n\n“I withdraw the word immediately--unreservedly,” she put in, with a\nsmile in which he read that genial mockery he knew so well.\n\n“You laugh at me--whenever I try to talk seriously,” he objected.\n\n“I laugh?” she queried, with an upward glance of demurely simulated\namazement. “Impossible! I assure you I've forgotten how.”\n\n“Ah, now we get to it!” he broke out, with energy. “You're really\nfeeling about it just as I am. You're not satisfied with what we're\ndoing--with the life we're leading--any more than I am. I see that,\nplain enough, now. I didn't dream of it before. Somehow I got the idea\nthat you were enjoying it immensely--the greenhouses and gardens and all\nthat sort of thing. And do you know who it was that put me right--that\ntold me you hated it?”\n\n“Oh, don't let us talk of him!” Edith exclaimed, swiftly.\n\nThorpe laughed. “You're wrong. It wasn't your father. I didn't see him.\nNo--it was my sister. She's never seen you, but all the same she knew\nenough to give me points. She told me I was a fool to suppose you were\nhappy here.”\n\n“How clever of her!” A certain bantering smile accompanied the words,\nbut on the instant it faded away. She went on with a musing gravity.\n“I'm sorry I don't get to know your sister. She seems an extremely real\nsort of person. I can understand that she might be difficult to live\nwith--I daresay all genuine characters are--but she's very real.\nAlthough, apparently, conversation isn't her strong point, still I enjoy\ntalking with her.”\n\n“How do you mean?” Thorpe asked, knitting his brows in puzzlement.\n\n“Oh, I often go to her shop--or did when I was in town. I went almost\nimmediately after our--our return to England. I was half afraid\nshe would recognize me--the portraits in the papers, you know--but\napparently she didn't. And it's splendid--the way she says absolutely\nnothing more than it's necessary to say. And her candour! If she thinks\nbooks are bad she says so. Fancy that!”\n\nHe still frowned uneasily as he looked down at her. “You never mentioned\nto me that you had gone there,” he told her, as if in reproach.\n\n“Ah, it was complicated,” Edith explained. “She objects to knowing me--I\nthink secretly I respect her a great deal for that--and therefore there\nis something clandestine about my getting to know her--and I could not\nbe sure how it would impress you, and really it seemed simplest not to\nmention it.”\n\n“It isn't that alone,” he declared, grave-faced still, but with a softer\nvoice. “Do you remember what I said the other day? It would make all the\ndifference in the world to me, if--if you were really--actually my other\nhalf!”\n\nThe phrase which he had caught at seemed, as it fell upon the air, to\nimpregnate it with some benumbing quality. The husband and wife looked\ndumbly, almost vacantly at one another, for what appeared a long time.\n\n“I mean”--all at once Thorpe found tongue, and even a sort of fluency as\nhe progressed--“I mean, if you shared things really with me! Oh, I'm\nnot complaining; you mustn't think that. The agreement we made at the\nstart--you've kept your part of it perfectly. You've done better than\nthat: you've kept still about the fact that it made you unhappy.”\n\n“Oh no,” she interposed, gently. “It is not the fact that it has made me\nunhappy.”\n\n“Well--discontented, then,” he resumed, without pause. “Here we are. We\ndo the thing we want to do--we make the kind of home for ourselves\nthat we've agreed we would like--and then it turns out that somehow it\ndoesn't come up to expectations. You get tired of it. I suppose, if the\ntruth were known, I'm by way of being tired of it too. Well, if you look\nat it, that fact is the most important thing in the world for both of\nus. It's the one thing that we ought to be most anxious to discuss, and\nexamine frankly in all its bearings--in order to see if we can't better\nit--but that's precisely the thing that doesn't get talked about between\nus. You would never have told me that you were unhappy----”\n\n“You use the word again,” she reminded him, a wan smile softening her\nprotest.\n\nThorpe stood up, and took a slow step toward the chair. He held her\nglance with his own, as he stood then, his head bent, gravely regarding\nher.\n\n“Do you tell me that you are happy?” he asked, with sober directness.\n\nShe fluttered her hands in a little restrained gesture of comment. “You\nconsider only the extremes,” she told him. “Between black and white\nthere are so many colours and shades and half-tones! The whole spectrum,\nin fact. Hardly anybody, I should think, gets over the edge into the\ntrue black or the true white. There are always tints, modifications.\nPeople are always inside the colour-scheme, so to speak. The worst that\ncan be said of me is that I may be in the blues--in the light-blues--but\nit is fair to remember that they photograph white.”\n\nThough there was an impulse within him to resent this as trifling,\nhe resisted it, and judicially considered her allegory. “That is to\nsay”--he began hesitatingly.\n\n“To the observer I am happy. To myself I am not unhappy.”\n\n“Why won't you tell me, Edith, just where you are?”\n\nThe sound of her name was somewhat unfamiliar to their discourse. The\nintonation which his voice gave to it now caused her to look up quickly.\n\n“If I could tell myself,” she answered him, after an instant's thought,\n“pray believe that I would tell you.”\n\nThe way seemed for the moment blocked before him, and he sighed heavily.\n“I want to get nearer to you,” he said, with gloom, “and I don't!”\n\nIt occurred to her to remark: “You take exception to my phraseology when\nI say you always try to be 'nice,' but I'm sure you know what I mean.”\n She offered him this assurance with a tentative smile, into which he\ngazed moodily.\n\n“You didn't think I was 'nice' when you consented to marry me,” he was\nsuddenly inspired to say. “I can't imagine your applying that word to me\nthen in your mind. God knows what it was you did say to yourself about\nme, but you never said I was 'nice.' That was the last word that would\nhave fitted me then--and now it's the only one you can think of.”\n The hint that somehow he had stumbled upon a clue to the mysteries\nenveloping him rose to prominence in his mind as he spoke. The year had\nwrought a baffling difference in him. He lacked something now that then\nhe had possessed, but he was powerless to define it.\n\nHe seated himself again in the chair, and put his hand through her arm\nto keep her where she lightly rested beside him. “Will you tell me,” he\nsaid, with a kind of sombre gentleness, “what the word is that you would\nhave used then? I know you wouldn't--couldn't--have called me 'nice.'\nWhat would you have called me?”\n\nShe paused in silence for a little, then slipped from the chair and\nstood erect, still leaving her wrist within the restraining curve of his\nfingers. “I suppose,” she said, musingly--“I suppose I should have said\n'powerful' or 'strong.'” Then she released her arm, and in turn moved to\nthe parapet.\n\n“And I am weak now--I am 'nice,'” he reflected, mechanically.\n\nIn the profile he saw, as she looked away at the vast distant horizon,\nthere was something pensive, even sad. She did not speak at once, and as\nhe gazed at her more narrowly it seemed as if her lips were quivering.\nA new sense of her great beauty came to him--and with it a hint that\nfor the instant at least her guard was down. He sprang to his feet, and\nstood beside her.\n\n“You ARE going to be open with me--Edith!” he pleaded, softly.\n\nShe turned from him a little, as if to hide the signs of her agitation.\n“Oh, what is there to say?” she demanded, in a tone which was almost a\nwail. “It is not your fault. I'm not blaming you.”\n\n“WHAT is not my fault?” he persisted with patient gentleness.\n\nSuddenly she confronted him. There were the traces of tears upon\nher lashes, and serenity had fled from her face. “It is a mistake--a\nblunder,” she began, hurriedly. “I take it all upon my own shoulders.\nI was the one who did it. I should have had more judgment--more good\nsense!”\n\n“You are not telling me, are you,” he asked with gravity, “that you are\nsorry you married me?”\n\n“Is either of us glad?” she retorted, breathlessly. “What is there to be\nglad about? You are bored to death--you confess it. And I--well, it is\nnot what I thought it would be. I deceived myself. I do not reproach\nyou.”\n\n“No, you keep saying that,” he observed, with gloomy slowness of\nutterance. “But what is it you reproach yourself with, then? We might as\nwell have it out.”\n\n“Yes,” she assented, with a swift reversion to calm. Her eyes met his\nwith a glance which had in it an implacable frankness. “I married one\nman because he would be able to make me a Duchess. I married another\nbecause he had eighty thousand a year. That is the kind of beast I am.\nThere is bad blood in me. You know my father; that is quite enough. I am\nhis daughter; that explains everything.”\n\nThe exaggeration of her tone and words produced a curious effect\nupon him. He stared at her for a little, perceiving slowly that a new\npersonage was being revealed to him. The mask of delicately-balanced\ncynicism, of amiably polite indifference, had been lifted; there was a\nwoman of flesh and blood beneath it, after all--a woman to whom he could\ntalk on terms of intimacy.\n\n“Rubbish!” he said, and his big face lightened into a genial, paternal\nsmile. “You didn't marry me for my money at all! What nonsense! I simply\ncame along and carried you off. You couldn't help yourself. It would\nhave been the same if I hadn't had sixpence.”\n\nTo his sharp scrutiny there seemed to flicker in her eyes a kind of\nanswering gleam. Then she hastily averted her glance, and in this action\ntoo there was a warrant for his mounting confidence.\n\n“The trouble has been,” he declared, “that I've been too much afraid of\nyou. I've thought that you were made of so much finer stuff than I am,\nthat you mustn't be touched. That was all a mistake. I see it right\nenough now. You ARE finer than I am--God knows there's no dispute about\nthat--but that's no reason why I should have hung up signs of 'Hands\noff!' all around you, and been frightened by them myself. I had the\ncheek to capture you and carry you off--and I ought to have had the\npluck to make you love me afterward, and keep it up. And that's what I'm\ngoing to do!”\n\nTo this declaration she offered no immediate reply, but continued to\ngaze with a vaguely meditative air upon the expanse of landscape spread\nbelow them. He threw a hasty glance over the windows behind him, and\nthen with assurance passed his arm round her waist. He could not say\nthat there was any responsive yielding to his embrace, but he did affirm\nto himself with new conviction, as he looked down upon the fair small\nhead at his shoulder, with its lovely pale-brown hair drawn softly\nover the temples, and its glimpse of the matchless profile inclined\nbeneath--that it was all right.\n\nHe waited for a long time, with a joyous patience, for her to speak. The\nmere fact that she stood beneath his engirdling arm, and gave no thought\nto the potential servants'-eyes behind them, was enough for present\nhappiness. He regarded the illimitable picture commanded from his\nterrace with refreshed eyes; it was once again the finest view in\nEngland--and something much more than that beside.\n\nAt last, abruptly, she laughed aloud--a silvery, amused little laugh\nunder her breath. “How comedy and tragedy tread forever on each other's\nheels!” she remarked. Her tone was philosophically gay, but upon\nreflection he did not wholly like her words.\n\n“There wasn't any tragedy,” he said, “and there isn't any comedy.”\n\nShe laughed again. “Oh, don't say that this doesn't appeal to your sense\nof humour!” she urged, with mock fervour.\n\nThorpe sighed in such unaffected depression at this, that she seemed\ntouched by his mood. Without stirring from his hold, she lifted her\nface. “Don't think I'm hateful,” she bade him, and her eyes were very\nkind. “There's more truth in what you've been saying than even you\nimagine. It really wasn't the money--or I mean it might easily have been\nthe same if there had been no money. But how shall I explain it? I am\nattracted by a big, bold, strong pirate, let us say, but as soon as\nhe has carried me off--that is the phrase for it--then he straightway\nrenounces crime and becomes a law-abiding, peaceful citizen. My\nbuccaneer transforms himself, under my very eyes, into an alderman! Do\nyou say there is no comedy in that--and tragedy too?”\n\n“Oh, put it that way and it's all right,” he declared, after a moment's\nconsideration. “I've got as much fun in me as anybody else,” he went\non, “only your jokes have a way of raising blisters on me, somehow.\nBut that's all done with now. That's because I didn't know you--was\nfrightened of you. But I aint scared any more. Everything is different!”\n\nWith a certain graciousness of lingering movement, she withdrew herself\nfrom his clasp, and faced him with a doubtful smile. “Ah, don't be too\nsure,” she murmured.\n\n“Everything is different!” he repeated, with confident emphasis. “Don't\nyou see yourself it is?”\n\n“You say it is,” she replied, hesitatingly, “but that alone doesn't make\nit so. The assertion that life isn't empty doesn't fill it.”\n\n“Ah, but NOW you will talk with me about all that,” he broke in\ntriumphantly. “We've been standing off with one another. We've been\nof no help to each other. But we'll change that, now. We'll talk over\neverything together. We'll make up our minds exactly what we want to do,\nand then I'll tuck you under my arm and we'll set out and do it.”\n\nShe smiled with kindly tolerance for his new-born enthusiasm. “Don't\ncount on me for too much wisdom or invention,” she warned him. “If\nthings are to be done, you are still the one who will have to do them.\nBut undoubtedly you are at your best when you are doing things. This\nreally has been no sort of life for you, here.”\n\nHe gathered her arm into his. “Come and show me your greenhouses,” he\nsaid, and began walking toward the end of the terrace. “It'll turn\nout to have been all right for me, this year that I've spent here,” he\ncontinued, as they strolled along. There was a delightful consciousness\nof new intimacy conveyed by the very touch of her arm, which filled his\ntone with buoyancy. “I've been learning all sorts of tricks here, and\ngetting myself into your ways of life. It's all been good training. In\nevery way I'm a better man than I was.”\n\nThey had descended from the terrace to a garden path, and approached\nnow a long glass structure, through the panes of which masses of soft\ncolour--whites, yellows, pinks, mauves, and strange dull reds--were\ndimly perceptible.\n\n“The chrysanthemums are not up to much this year,” Edith observed,\nas they drew near to the door of this house. “Collins did them very\nbadly--as he did most other things. But next year it will be very\ndifferent. Gafferson is the best chrysanthemum man in England. That is\nhe in there now, I think.”\n\nThorpe stopped short, and stared at her, the while the suggestions\nstirred by the sound of this name slowly shaped themselves.\n\n“Gafferson?” he asked her, with a blank countenance.\n\n“My new head-gardener,” she explained. “He was at Hadlow, and after poor\nold Lady Plowden died--why, surely you remember him there. You spoke\nabout him--you'd known him somewhere--in the West Indies, wasn't it?”\n\nHe looked into vacancy with the aspect of one stupefied. “Did I?” he\nmumbled automatically.\n\nThen, with sudden decision, he swung round on the gravel. “I've got a\nkind of headache coming on,” he said. “If you don't mind, we won't go\ninside among the flowers.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nTHORPE walked along, in the remoter out-of-the-way parts of the great\ngardens, as the first shadows of evening began to dull the daylight.\nFor a long time he moved aimlessly about, sick at heart and benumbed of\nmind, in the stupid oppression of a bad dream.\n\nThere ran through all his confused thoughts the exasperating\nconsciousness that it was nonsense to be frightened, or even disturbed;\nthat, in truth, nothing whatever had happened. But he could not lay hold\nof it to any comforting purpose. Some perverse force within him insisted\non raising new phantoms in his path, and directing his reluctant gaze\nto their unpleasant shapes. Forgotten terrors pushed themselves upon his\nrecollection. It was as if he stood again in the Board Room, with the\ntelegram telling of old Tavender's death in his hands, waiting to hear\nthe knock of Scotland Yard upon the door.\n\nThe coming of Gafferson took on a kind of supernatural aspect, when\nThorpe recalled its circumstances. His own curious mental ferment, which\nhad made this present week a period apart in his life, had begun in the\nvery hour of this man's approach to the house. His memory reconstructed\na vivid picture of that approach--of the old ramshackle village trap,\nand the boy and the bags and the yellow tin trunk, and that decent,\nred-bearded, plebeian figure, so commonplace and yet so elusively\nsuggestive of something out of the ordinary. It seemed to him now\nthat he had at the time discerned a certain fateful quality in the\napparition. And he and his wife had actually been talking of old Kervick\nat the moment! It was their disagreement over him which had prevented\nher explaining about the new head-gardener. There was an effect of the\nuncanny in all this.\n\nAnd what did Gafferson want? How much did he know? The idea that perhaps\nold Kervick had found him out, and patched up with him a scheme of\nblackmail, occurred to him, and in the unreal atmosphere of his mood,\nbecame a thing of substance. With blackmail, however, one could always\ndeal; it was almost a relief to see the complication assume that guise.\nBut if Gafferson was intent upon revenge and exposure instead? With such\na slug-like, patient, tenacious fool, was that not more likely?\n\nReasonable arguments presented themselves to his mind ever and again:\nhis wife had known of Gafferson's work, and thought highly of it, and\nhad been in a position to learn of his leaving Hadlow. What more natural\nthan that she should hasten to employ him? And what was it, after all,\nthat Gafferson could possibly know or prove? His brother-in-law had gone\noff, and got too drunk to live, and had died. What in the name of all\nthat was sensible had this to do with Thorpe? Why should it even\nbe supposed that Gafferson associated Thorpe with any phase of the\nbusiness? And if he had any notion of a hostile movement, why should he\nhave delayed action so long? Why indeed!\n\nReassurance did not come to him, but at last an impulse to definite\naction turned his footsteps toward the cluster of greenhouses in the\ndeepening shadow of the mansion. He would find Gafferson, and probe this\nbusiness to the uttermost. If there was discoverable in the man's manner\nor glance the least evidence of a malevolent intention--he would know\nwhat to do. Ah, what was it that he would do? He could not say, beyond\nthat it would be bad for Gafferson. He instinctively clenched the\nfists in the pockets of his jacket as he quickened his pace. Inside the\ncongeries of glazed houses he was somewhat at sea. It was still light\nenough to make one's way about in the passages between the stagings, but\nhe had no idea of the general plan of the buildings, and it seemed to\nhim that he frequently got back to places he had traversed before. There\nwere two or three subordinate gardeners in or about the houses, but\nupon reflection he forbore to question them. He tried to assume an\nidly indifferent air as he sauntered past, nodding almost imperceptible\nacknowledgment of the forefingers they jerked upward in salutation.\n\nHe came at last upon a locked door, the key of which had been removed.\nThe fact vaguely surprised him, and he looked with awakened interest\nthrough the panes of this door. The air inside seemed slightly\nthickened--and then his eye caught the flicker of a flame, straight\nahead. It was nothing but the fumigation of a house; the burning spirits\nin the lamp underneath the brazier were filling the structure with\nvapours fatal to all insect life. In two or three hours the men would\ncome and open the doors and windows and ventilate the place. The\noperation was quite familiar to him; it had indeed interested him more\nwhen he first saw it done than had anything else connected with the\ngreenhouses.\n\nHis abstracted gaze happened to take note of the fact that the door-key\nwas hanging on a nail overhead, and then suddenly this seemed to be\nrelated to something else in his thoughts--some obscure impression\nor memory which evaded him. Continuing to look at the key, a certain\nrecollection all at once assumed great definiteness in his mind: it came\nto him that the labels on this patent fumigator they were using warned\npeople against exposing themselves to its fumes more than was absolutely\nnecessary. That meant, of course, that their full force would kill a\nhuman being. It was very interesting. He looked through the glass again,\nbut could not see that the air was any thicker. The lamp still burned\nbrightly.\n\nHe turned away, and beheld a man, in an old cap and apron, at the\nfurther end of the palm-house he was in, doing something to a plant.\nThorpe noted the fact that he felt no surprise in seeing that it was\nGafferson. Somehow the sight of the key, and of the poison-spreading\nflame inside the locked door, seemed to have prepared him for the\nspectacle of Gafferson close at hand. He moved forward slowly toward the\nhead-gardener, and luminous plans rose in his mind, ready-made at\neach step. He could strangle this annoying fool, or smother him, into\nnon-resisting insensibility, and then put him inside that death-house,\nand let it be supposed that he had been asphyxiated by accident. The men\nwhen they came back would find him there. But ah! they would know that\nthey had not left him there; they would have seen him outside, no doubt,\nafter the fire had been lighted. Well, the key could be left in the\nunlocked door. Then it could be supposed that he had rashly entered, and\nbeen overcome by the vapours. He approached the man silently, his brain\narranging the details of the deed with calm celerity.\n\nThen some objections to the plan rose up before him: they dealt almost\nexclusively with the social nuisance the thing would entail. There was\nto be a house-party, with that Duke and Duchess in it, of whom his\nwife talked so much, and it would be a miserable kind of bore to have\na suffocated gardener forced upon them as a principal topic of\nconversation. Of course, too, it would more or less throw the whole\nhousehold into confusion. And its effect upon his wife!--the progress\nof his thoughts was checked abruptly by this suggestion. A vision of the\nshock such a catastrophe might involve to her--or at the best, of the\ngross unpleasantness she would find in it--flashed over his mind, and\nthen yielded to a softening, radiant consciousness of how much this\nmeant to him. It seemed to efface everything else upon the instant. A\nprofoundly tender desire for her happiness was in complete possession.\nAlready the notion of doing anything to wound or grieve her appeared\nincredible to him.\n\n“Well, Gafferson,” he heard himself saying, in one of the more reserved\ntones of his patriarchal manner. He had halted close to the inattentive\nman, and stood looking down upon him. His glance was at once tolerant\nand watchful.\n\nGafferson slowly rose from his slouching posture, surveyed the other\nwhile his faculties in leisurely fashion worked out the problem of\nrecognition, aud then raised his finger to his cap-brim. “Good-evening,\nsir,” he said.\n\nThis gesture of deference was eloquently convincing. Thorpe, after an\ninstant's alert scrutiny, smiled upon him. “I was glad to hear that you\nhad come to us,” he said with benevolent affability. “We shall expect\ngreat things of a man of your reputation.”\n\n“It'll be a fair comfort, sir,” the other replied, “to be in a place\nwhere what one does is appreciated. What use is it to succeed in\nhybridizing a Hippeastrum procera with a Pancratium Amancaes, after\nover six hundred attempts in ten years, and then spend three years\na-hand-nursing the seedlings, and then your master won't take enough\ninterest in the thing to pay your fare up to London to the exhibition\nwith 'em? That's what 'ud break any man's heart.”\n\n“Quite true,” Thorpe assented, with patrician kindliness. “You need fear\nnothing of that sort here, Gafferson. We give you a free hand. Whatever\nyou want, you have only to let us know. And you can't do things too well\nto please us.” “Thank you, sir,” said Gafferson, and really, as Thorpe\nthought about it, the interview seemed at an end.\n\nThe master turned upon his heel, with a brief, oblique nod over his\nshoulder, and made his way out into the open air. Here, as he walked,\nhe drew a succession of long consolatory breaths. It was almost as if\nhe had emerged from the lethal presence of the fumigator itself. He took\nthe largest cigar from his case, lighted it, and sighed smoke-laden new\nrelief as he strolled back toward the terrace.\n\nBut a few minutes before he had been struggling helplessly in the coils\nof an evil nightmare. These terrors seemed infinitely far behind him\nnow. He gave an indifferent parting glance backward at them, as one\nmight over his after-breakfast cigar at the confused alarms of an early\nawakening hours before. There was nothing worth remembering--only the\nshapeless and foolish burden of a bad dream.\n\nThe assurance rose within him that he was not to have any more such\ntrouble. With a singular clearness of mental vision he perceived that\nthe part of him which brought bad dreams had been sloughed off, like a\nserpent's skin. There had been two Thorpes, and one of them--the Thorpe\nwho had always been willing to profit by knavery, and at last in a\nsplendid coup as a master thief had stolen nearly a million, and would\nhave shrunk not at all from adding murder to the rest, to protect that\nplunder--this vicious Thorpe had gone away altogether. There was no\nlonger a place for him in life; he would never be seen again by\nmortal eye....There remained only the good Thorpe, the pleasant,\nwell-intentioned opulent gentleman; the excellent citizen; the\nbeneficent master, to whom, even Gafferson like the others, touched a\nrespectful forelock.\n\nIt passed in the procession of his reverie as a kind of triumph of\nvirtue that the good Thorpe retained the fortune which the bad Thorpe\nhad stolen. It was in all senses a fortunate fact, because now it would\nbe put to worthy uses. Considering that he had but dimly drifted\nabout heretofore on the outskirts of the altruistic impulse, it was\nsurprisingly plain to him now that he intended to be a philanthropist.\nEven as he mentioned the word to himself, the possibilities suggested\nby it expanded in his thoughts. His old dormant, formless lust for power\nstirred again in his pulses. What other phase of power carried with it\nsuch rewards, such gratitudes, such humble subservience on all sides\nas far as the eye could reach--as that exercised by the intelligently\nmunificent philanthropist?\n\nIntelligence! that was the note of it all. Many rich people dabbled at\nthe giving of money, but they did it so stupidly, in such a slip-shod\nfashion, that they got no credit for it. Even millionaires more or less\nin public life, great newspaper-owners, great brewer-peers, and the\nlike, men who should know how to do things well, gave huge sums in bulk\nfor public charities, such as the housing of the poor, and yet contrived\nsomehow to let the kudos that should have been theirs evaporate. He\nwould make no such mistake as that.\n\nIt was easy enough to see wherein they erred. They gave superciliously,\nhanding down their alms from a top lofty altitude of Tory superiority,\nand the Radicals down below sniffed or growled even while they\ngrudgingly took these gifts--that was all nonsense. These aristocratic\nor tuft-hunting philanthropists were the veriest duffers. They laid out\nmillions of pounds in the vain attempt to secure what might easily\nbe had for mere thousands, if they went sensibly to work. Their vast\nbenefactions yielded them at the most bare thanks, or more often no\nthanks at all, because they lacked the wit to lay aside certain little\ntrivial but annoying pretensions, and waive a few empty prejudices.\nThey went on, year after year, tossing their fortunes into a sink of\ncontemptuous ingratitude, wondering feebly why they were not beloved in\nreturn. It was because they were fools. They could not, or they would\nnot, understand the people they sought to manipulate.\n\nWhat could not a man of real brain, of real breadth and energy and force\nof character, do in London with two hundred thousand pounds? Why, he\ncould make himself master of the town! He could break into fragments the\npolitical ascendency of the snob, “semi-detached” villa classes, in half\nthe Parliamentary divisions they now controlled. He could reverse\nthe partisan complexion of the Metropolitan delegation, and lead to\nWestminster a party of his own, a solid phalanx of disciplined men,\nstanding for the implacable Democracy of reawakened London. With such a\nbacking, he could coerce ministries at will, and remake the politics of\nEngland. The role of Great Oliver himself was not too hopelessly beyond\nthe scope of such a vision.\n\nThorpe threw his cigar-end aside, and then noted that it was almost\ndark. He strode up to the terrace two steps at a time, and swung along\nits length with a vigour and exhilaration of movement he had not known,\nit seemed to him, for years. He felt the excitement of a new incentive\nbubbling in his veins.\n\n“Her Ladyship is in her sitting-room, sir,” a domestic replied to his\nenquiry in the hall. The title arrested his attention from some\nfresh point of view, and he pondered it, as he made his way along the\ncorridor, and knocked at a door. At the sound of a voice he pushed open\nthe door, and went in.\n\nLady Cressage, looking up, noted, with aroused interest, a marked change\nin his carriage. He stood aggressively erect, his big shoulders squared,\nand his head held high. On his massive face there was the smile, at once\nbuoyant and contained, of a strong man satisfied with himself.\n\nSomething impelled her to rise, and to put a certain wistfulness of\nenquiry into her answering smile.\n\n“Your headache is better then?” she asked him.\n\nHe looked puzzled for a moment, then laughed lightly. “Oh--yes,” he\nanswered. Advancing, he caught her suddenly, almost vehemently, in his\narms, aud covered the face that was perforce upturned with kisses. When\nshe was released from this overwhelming embrace, and stood panting\nand flushed, regarding him with narrowed, intent eyes, in which\nmystification was mellowed by the gleam of not-displeased curiosity, he\npreferred a request which completed her bewilderment.\n\n“Mrs. Thorpe,” he began, with significant deliberation, but smiling with\nhis eyes to show the tenderness underlying his words--“would you mind if\nwe didn't dress for dinner this evening, and if we dined in the little\nbreakfast-room--or here, for that matter--instead of the big place?”\n\n“Why, not at all, if you wish it,” she answered readily enough, but\nviewing him still with a puzzled glance.\n\n“I'm full of new ideas,” he explained, impulsively impatient of the\nnecessity to arrange a sequence among his thoughts. “I see great things\nahead. It's all come to me in a minute, but I couldn't see it clearer if\nI'd thought it out for a year. Perhaps I was thinking of it all the time\nand didn't know it. But anyhow, I see my way straight ahead. You don't\nknow what it means to me to have something to do. It makes another man\nof me, just to think about it. Another man?--yes, twenty men! It's a\nthing that can be done, and by God! I'm going to do it!”\n\nShe beheld in his face, as she scrutinized it, a stormy glow of the\nman's native, coarse, imperious virility, reasserting itself through\nthe mask of torpor which this vacuous year had superimposed. The large\nfeatures were somehow grown larger still; they dominated the countenance\nas rough bold headlands dominate a shore. It was the visage of a\nconqueror--of a man gathering within himself, to expend upon his\nfellows, the appetites, energies, insensibilities, audacities of a beast\nof prey. Her glance fluttered a little, and almost quailed, before the\nfrank barbarism of power in the look he bent upon her. Then it came to\nher that something more was to be read in this look; there was in it a\nreservation of magnanimity, of protection, of entreating invitation, for\nher special self. He might tear down with his claws, and pull to pieces\nand devour others; but his mate he would shelter and defend and love\nwith all his strength. An involuntary trembling thrill ran through\nher--and then she smiled up at him.\n\n“What is it you're going to do?” she asked him, mechanically. Her mind\nroved far afield.\n\n“Rule England!” he told her with gravity.\n\nFor the moment there seemed to her nothing positively incongruous in\nthe statement. To look at him, as he loomed before her, uplifted by his\nrefreshed and soaring self-confidence, it appeared not easy to say what\nwould be impossible to him.\n\nShe laughed, after a fleeting pause, with a plainer note of\ngood-fellowship than he had ever heard in her voice before.\n“Delightful,” she said gayly. “But I'm not sure that I quite understand\nthe--the precise connection of morning-dress and dinner in a small room\nwith the project.” He nodded pleased comprehension of the spirit in\nwhich she took him. “Just a whim,” he explained. “The things I've got\nin mind don't fit at all with ceremony, and that big barn of a room, and\nmen standing about. What I want more than anything else is a quiet snug\nlittle evening with you alone, where I can talk to you and--and we can\nbe together by ourselves. You'd like it, wouldn't you?”\n\nShe hesitated, and there was a novel confession of embarrassment in her\nmantling colour and down-spread lashes. It had always to his eyes been,\nfrom the moment he first beheld it, the most beautiful face in the\nworld--exquisitely matchless in its form and delicacy of line and serene\nyet sensitive grace. But he had not seen in it before, or guessed that\nthere could come to it, this crowning added loveliness of feminine\nconfusion.\n\n“You would like it, wouldn't you?” he repeated in a lower, more\nstrenuous tone.\n\nShe lifted her eyes slowly, and looked, not into his, but over his\nshoulder, as in a reverie, half meditation, half languorous dreaming.\nShe swayed rather than stepped toward him.\n\n“I think,” she answered, in a musing murmur,--“I think I shall\nlike--everything.”\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nTHORPE found the Duke of Glastonbury a much more interesting person\nto watch and to talk with, both during the dinner Saturday evening and\nlater, than he had anticipated.\n\nHe was young, and slight of frame, and not at all imposing in stature,\nbut he bore himself with a certain shy courtliness of carriage which had\na distinction of its own. His face, with its little black moustache\nand large dark eyes, was fine upon examination, but in some elusively\nforeign way. There lingered a foreign note, too, in the way he talked.\nHis speech was English enough to the ear, it was true, but it was the\nconsidered English of a book, and its phrases had a deftness which was\nhardly native. He looked, if not a sad young man, then one conscious\nalways of sufficient reasons for sadness, but one came, after a time, to\nsee that the mood beneath was not melancholy. It had even its sprightly\nside, which shone out irregularly in his glance and talk, from a sober\nmean of amiable weariness.\n\nThorpe knew his extraordinary story--that of a poor tutor, earning his\nliving in ignorance of the fact that he had a birthright of any sort,\nwho had been miraculously translated into the heir, not only to an\nancient title but to vast collateral wealth. He had been born and reared\nin France, and it was there that the heralds of this stupendous change\nin his affairs had found him out. There was a good deal more to the\nstory, including numerous unsavoury legends about people now many years\ndead, and it was impossible to observe the young Duke and not seem to\nperceive signs that he was still nervously conscious of these legends.\nThe story of his wife--a serene, grey-eyed, rather silent young person,\nwith a pale face of some beauty, and with much purity and intellect--was\nstrange enough to match. She also had earned her own living, as a\nprivate secretary or type-writing girl, or something of the sort, and\nher husband had deliberately chosen her after he had come into his\ntitle. One might study her very closely, however, and catch no hint that\nthese facts in any degree disconcerted her.\n\nThorpe studied her a good deal, in a furtive way, with a curiosity born\nof his knowledge that the Duke had preferred her, when he might have\nmarried his widowed cousin, who was now Thorpe's own wife. How he had\ncome to know this, he could never have told. He had breathed it in,\nsomehow, with the gossip-laden atmosphere of that one London season of\nhis. It was patent enough, too, that his wife--his Edith--had not only\nliked this ducal youngster very much, but still entertained toward him\na considerable affection. She had never dissembled this feeling, and it\nvisibly informed her glance and manner now, at her own table, when she\nturned to speak with him, where he sat at her right hand. Thorpe had\nnever dreamed of thinking ill of his wife's friendship, even when her\nindifference to what he thought had been most taken for granted. Now\nthat this was all changed, and the amazing new glory of a lover had\nenveloped him, he had a distinct delight in watching the myriad charming\nphases of her kind manner, half-sisterly, half-motherly, toward the\ngrave-faced young man. It was all a part of the delicious change which\nthese past few days had wrought in her, this warm and supple softness of\nmien, of eye and smile and voice.\n\nBut how the Duke, if really he had had a chance to marry Edith, could\nhave taken the type-writer instead, baffled speculation. Thorpe gave\nmore attention to this problem, during dinner, than he did to the\nconversation of the table. His exchange of sporadic remarks with the\nyoung Duchess beside him was indeed an openly perfunctory affair, which\nleft him abundant leisure to contemplate her profile in silence, while\nshe turned to listen to the general talk, of which Miss Madden and the\nHon. Winifred Plowden bore the chief burden. The talk of these ladies\ninterested him but indifferently, though the frequent laughter suggested\nthat it was amusing. He looked from his wife to the Duchess and back\nagain, in ever-recurring surprise that the coronet had been carried\npast Edith. And once he looked a long time at his wife and the Duke, and\nformulated the theory that she must have refused him. No doubt that was\nwhy she had been sympathetically fond of him ever since, and was being\nso nice to him now. Yes--clearly that was it. He felt upon this that he\nalso liked the Duke very much.\n\nIt was by no means so apparent that the Duke liked him. Both he and his\nDuchess, indeed, were scrupulously and even deferentially polite, but\nthere was a painstaking effect about it, which, seemingly, they lacked\nthe art altogether to conceal. It seemed to Thorpe that the other guests\nunconsciously took their cue from this august couple, and all exposed\nsomewhat the effort their civility to him involved. At another time the\nsuspicion of this would have stung him. He had only to glance across the\ntable to where his wife sat now, and it was all right. What other\npeople thought of him--how other people liked or disliked him--was of no\nearthly importance. Whenever he chose to exert himself, he could compel\nfrom them the behaviour that he desired. It was their dull inability\nto read character which prompted them to regard him as merely a rich\noutsider who had married Edith Cressage. He viewed with a comfortable\ntolerance this infirmity of theirs. When the time came, if he wanted to\ndo so, he could awaken them to their delusion as by forked lightning and\nthe burst of thunder.\n\nThe whim came to him, and expanded swiftly into a determination, to\ncontrive some intimate talk forthwith with the Duke. The young man\nseemed both clever and sensible, and in a way impressionable as well.\nThorpe thought that he would probably have some interesting things to\nsay, but still more he thought of him as a likely listener. It would be\nthe easier to detach him from the company, since the occasion was one\nof studied informality. The Duke did not go about in society, in the\nordinary sense of the word, and he would not have come to High Thorpe to\nmeet a large party. He was here as a kinsman and friend of his hostess\nfor a quiet week; and the few other guests fitted readily enough into\nthe picture of a family gathering. The spirit of domesticity had indeed\nso obviously descended upon the little group in the drawing-room, an\nhour or so after dinner, that Thorpe felt it quite the natural thing to\nput his arm through that of the Duke and lead him off to his personal\nsmoking-room. He even published his intention by audibly bidding the\nHon. Balder Plowden to remain with the ladies.\n\nWhen the two had seated themselves in soft, low easy-chairs, and the\nhost had noted with pleasure that his guest had no effeminate qualms in\nthe matter of large rich cigars, a brief silence ensued.\n\n“I am very anxious to get your views on a certain subject,” Thorpe was\ninspired to begin, bluntly pushing preliminaries aside. “If a man of\nfortune wishes to do genuine good with his money, here in England, how\nshould he best go about it?”\n\nThe Duke looked up at his questioner, with a sudden flash of surprise on\nhis dark, mobile face. He hesitated a moment, and smiled a little. “You\nask of me the sum of human wisdom,” he said. “It is the hardest of all\nproblems; no one solves it.”\n\nThorpe nodded his big head comprehendingly. “That's all the more reason\nwhy it ought to be solved,” he declared, with slow emphasis.\n\nThe other expressed by look and tone an augmented consciousness of the\nunexpected. “I did not know,” he remarked cautiously, “that this was a\nmatter in which you were specially concerned. It pleases me very much to\nhear it. Even if the solution does not come, it is well to have as many\nas possible turning the problem over in their minds.”\n\n“Oh, but I'm going to solve it!” Thorpe told him, with round confidence.\n\nThe Duke pulled contemplatively at his cigar for a little. “Do not think\nme a cynic,” he began at last. “You are a man of affairs; you have made\nyour own way; you should be even more free from illusions than I am.\nIf you tell me that these good things can be done, I am the last one\nto dispute you. But I have seen near at hand experiments of exceptional\nimportance, on a very grand scale, and the result does not encourage me.\nI come to doubt indeed if money has any such power in these affairs\nas we think it has--for that matter, if it has any power at all.\nThe shifting of money can always disorganize what is going on at the\nmoment--change it about and alter it in many ways--but its effect is\nonly temporary. As soon as the pressure is released, the human atoms\nrearrange themselves as they were before, and the old conditions return.\nI think the only force which really makes any permanent difference is\ncharacter--and yet about even that I am not sure. The best man I have\never known--and in many respects the ablest--devoted untold energy and\nlabour, and much money, too, to the service of a few thousand people in\nSomerset, on land of his own, upon a theory wonderfully elaborated and\nworked out. Perhaps you have heard of Emanuel Torr and his colony, his\nSystem?”\n\nThorpe shook his head.\n\n“He had worked tremendously for years at it. He fell ill and went\naway--and in a day all the results of his labours and outlay were flat\non the ground. The property is mine now, and it is farmed and managed\nagain in the ordinary way, and really the people there seem already\nto have forgotten that they had a prophet among them. The marvelous\ncharacter of the man--you look in vain for any sign of an impress that\nit left upon them. I never go there. I cannot bear those people. I have\nsometimes the feeling that if it were feasible I should like to oppress\nthem in some way--to hurt them.”\n\n“Oh! 'the people' are hogs, right enough,” Thorpe commented genially,\n“but they ARE 'the people,' and they're the only tools we've got to work\nwith to make the world go round.”\n\n“But if you leave the world alone,” objected the Duke, “it goes round\nof itself. And if you don't leave it alone, it goes round just the\nsame, without any reference whatever to your exertions. Some few men are\nalways cleverer or noisier or more restless than the others, and\ntheir activity produces certain deviations and peculiarities in their\ngeneration. The record of these--generally a very faulty and foolish\nrecord--we call history. We say of these movements in the past that some\nof them were good and some were bad. Our sons very likely will differ\ntotally from us about which were good and which were bad; quite\npossibly, in turn, their sons may agree with us. I do not see that it\nmatters. We cannot treat anything as final--except that the world goes\nround. We appear out of the darkness at one edge of it; we are carried\nacross and pitched off into the darkness at the other edge of it. We are\ncertain about nothing else.”\n\n“Except that some of us have to pay for our ride, and others don't,” put\nin Thorpe. The tone in which he spoke made his meaning so clear that his\nGrace sat up.\n\n“Ah, you think we do not pay?” he queried, his countenance brightening\nwith the animation of debate. “My dear sir, we pay more than anyone\nelse. Our fares are graduated, just as our death-duties are. No doubt\nthere are some idle and stupid, thick-skinned rich fellows, who escape\nthe ticket-collector. But for each of them there are a thousand idle\npoor fellows who do the same. You, for example, are a man of large\nwealth. I, for my sins, carry upon my back the burden of a prodigious\nfortune. Could we not go out now, and walk down the road to your nearest\nvillage, and find in the pub, there a dozen day-labourers happier than\nwe are? Why--it is Saturday night. Then I will not say a dozen, but\nas many as the tap will hold. It is not the beer alone that makes them\nhappy. Do not think that. It is the ability to rest untroubled,\nthe sense that till Monday they have no more responsibility than a\ntree-toad. Does the coming of Sunday make that difference to you or to\nme? When night comes, does it mean to us that we are to sleep off into\noblivion all we have done that day, and begin life afresh next morning?\nNo-o! We are the tired people; the load is never lifted from our backs.\nAh, do we not pay indeed!”\n\n“Oh-ho!” ejaculated Thorpe. He had been listening with growing\nastonishment to the other's confession. He was still surprised as he\nspoke, but a note of satisfaction mounted into his voice as he went on.\n“You are unhappy, too! You are a young man, in excellent health; you\nhave the wife you want; you understand good tobacco; you have a son.\nThat is a great deal--but my God! think what else you've got. You're the\nDuke of Glastonbury--one of the oldest titles in England. You're one of\nthe richest men in the country--the richest in the old peerage, at any\nrate, I'm told. And YOU'RE not happy!”\n\nThe other smiled. “Ah, the terms and forms survive,” he said, with a\nkind of pedagogic affability, “after the substance has disappeared.\nThe nobleman, the prince, was a great person in the times when he\nmonopolized wealth. It enabled him to monopolize almost everything\nelse that was pleasant or superb. He had the arts and the books and the\nmusicians and the silks and velvets, and the bath-tubs--everything that\nmade existence gorgeous--all to himself. He had war to amuse himself\nwith, and the seven deadly sins. The barriers are down now. Everything\nwhich used to be exclusively the nobleman's is now within everybody's\nreach, including the sins. And it is not only that others have levelled\nup to him; they have levelled him down. He cannot dress now more\nexpensively than other people. Gambling used to be recognized as one of\nhis normal relaxations, but now, the higher his rank, the more sharply\nhe is scolded for it. Naturally he does not know what to do with\nhimself. As an institution, he descends from a period when the only\nimaginable use for wealth was to be magnificent with it. But now in this\nbusiness age, where the recognized use of wealth is to make more\nwealth, he is so much out of place that he has even forgotten how to\nbe magnificent. There are some illustrated articles in one of the\nmagazines, giving photographs of the great historic country-houses of\nEngland. You should see the pictures of the interiors. The furniture and\ndecorations are precisely what a Brixton dressmaker would buy, if she\nsuddenly came into some money.”\n\n“All the same,” Thorpe stuck to his point, “you are not happy.”\n\nThe Duke frowned faintly, as if at the other's persistency. Then he\nshrugged his shoulders and answered in a lighter tone. “It hardly\namounts to that, I think. I confess that there are alleviations to\nmy lot. In the opinion of the world I am one of its most fortunate\ncitizens--and it is not for me to say that the world is altogether\nwrong. The chief point is--I don't know if you will quite follow\nme--there are limits to what position and fortune can give a man. And so\neasily they may deprive him of pleasures which poorer men enjoy! I may\nbe wrong, but it seems impossible to me that any rich man who has acres\nof gardens and vineries and glass can get up the same affection for\nit all that the cottager will have for his little flower-plot, that he\ntends with his own hands. One seems outside the realities of life--a\nmere spectator at the show.”\n\n“Ah, but why not DO things?” Thorpe demanded of him. “Why merely stand,\nas you say, and look on?”\n\nThe other leant his head back again. “Pray what do you recommend?” he\nasked almost listlessly.\n\n“Why--politics, for example.”\n\nThe Duke nodded, with an air of according to the suggestion a certain\nrespect. “Unhappily I am too much of a foreigner,” he commented. “I know\nEnglishmen and their affairs too imperfectly. Sometime--perhaps.”\n\n“And philanthropic work--you don't care about that,” pursued the other.\n\n“Oh--we go not so far as that,” said his Grace, with a deprecatory wave\nof the hands. “My wife finds many interests in it, only she would not\nlike to have you call it philanthropical. She is London-born, and it\nis a great pleasure to her to be of assistance to poorer young women in\nLondon, who have so little done for them by the community, and can do\nso little for themselves. I am much less skeptical about that particular\nwork, I may tell you, than about philanthropy in general. In fact, I am\nquite clear that it is doing good. At least it is doing a kindness, and\nthat is a pleasant occupation. We are really not so idle as one might\nthink. We work at it a good deal, my wife and I.”\n\n“So am I London-born,” Thorpe remarked, with a certain irrelevancy.\nAfter a moment's pause he turned a sharply enquiring glance upon his\nguest. “This thing that you're doing in London--does it give you any\n'pull' there?” “Pull?” repeated the other helplessly.\n\n“If there was something you wanted the people of London to do, would\nthey do it for you because of what you've been doing for them--or for\ntheir girls?”\n\nThe Duke looked puzzled for a moment. “But it isn't conceivable that I\nshould want London to do anything--unless it might be to consume its own\nsmoke,” he observed.\n\n“Quite so!” said Thorpe, rising bulkily to his feet, but signifying by a\ngesture that his companion was to remain seated. He puffed at his cigar\ntill its tip gleamed angrily through the smoke about him, and moved a\nfew steps with his hands in his pockets. “That is what I wanted to get\nat. Now I'm London-born, I've got the town in my blood. The Thorpes have\nbeen booksellers there for generations. The old name is over the old\nshop still. I think I know what Londoners are like; I ought to. It's my\nbelief that they don't want gifts. They'll take 'em, but it isn't what\nthey want. They're a trading people--one of the oldest in the world.\nCommercial traditions, the merchant's pride--these are bred in their\nbones. They don't want something for nothing. They like an honest\nbargain--fair on both sides. 'You help me and I'll help you.' And it's\nthe only way you can do anything worth doing.”\n\n“Well,” said the Duke, passively.\n\nThorpe halted, and still with the cigar between his teeth, looked down\nat him.\n\n“I can go into London, and study out the things that are to be\ndone--that need to be done--and divide these into two parts, those that\nbelong to private enterprise and those that ought to be done publicly.\nAnd I can say to Londoners--not in so many words, mind you, but in a way\nthe sharper ones will understand: 'Here, you fellows. I'll begin doing\nout of my own pocket one set of these things, and you in turn must put\nyourselves at my back, and stand by me, and put me in a position where\nI can make the Government do this other set of things.' That will appeal\nto them. A poor man couldn't lead them any distance, because he could\nalways be killed by the cry that he was filling his pockets. They will\nbelieve in a man whose ambition is to win an earldom and five thousand\na year out of politics, but they will stone to death the man who merely\ntries to get a few hundreds a year out of it for his wife and children.\nAnd a man like you can't do anything in London, because they can't see\nthat there's anything you want in return--and besides, in their hearts,\nthey don't like your class. Don't forget it! This is the city that\nchopped off the king's head!”\n\n“Ah, but this is also the city,” retorted the other, with placid\npleasure in his argument, “which decked itself in banners and ribbons to\nwelcome back the son of that same king. And if you think of it, he was\nrather a quaint thing in sons, too.”\n\n“It was the women did that,” Thorpe affirmed with readiness. “They get\ntheir own way once in a while, when the men are tired out, and they have\ntheir little spell of nonsense and monkey-shines, but it never lasts\nlong. Charles II. doesn't matter at all--but take my word for it, his\nfather matters a great deal. There was a Thorpe among the judges who\nvoted to behead him. I am descended in a straight line from him.”\n\nHis Grace shrugged his slight shoulders again. “It happens that my\nancestors had extremely large facilities for doing unpleasant things,\nand, God knows, they did them--but I don't quite see what that goes to\nprove, now.”\n\n“No, you don't grasp the idea,” said Thorpe, resignedly. After a\nmoment's pause he took the cigar from his lips, and straightened himself\n“All the same,” he declared roundly, “I am going to do the trick. London\nhas been waiting for an organizer--a leader--for a hundred years. The\nright kind of a man, going the right way to work, can stand London on\nits head, as surely as I can burn this cigar. And I'm going to have a\ntry at it.”\n\n“It is very interesting,” remarked the Duke, with vagueness. “But--are\nthe ladies waiting for us? And if so, aren't we keeping them up\nunconscionably?”\n\nAs if in comment upon his words, there was the sound of a faint rap at\nthe door. Then it opened, and through the dense blue haze of the room\nthey saw some shadowed forms softly indistinct save where the light from\nthe ceiling outside shone down upon a group of coiffured heads. A\nnoise of mingled coughing and laughter specifically completed the\nintroduction.\n\n“Oh, I'm--it's unendurable in there,” spoke the voice of the hostess.\n“We WERE coming in to smoke with you,” she called out through the cloud,\n“since you wouldn't stop with us.”\n\n“Come along!” answered Thorpe, cheerily. He strode to the end of the\nroom and raised a window. From the same corner he turned on some added\nlights.\n\nUnder this more effective illumination, the lady of the house advanced,\nwith Miss Madden and the Hon. Winifred close behind her. “Frank has gone\nto bed,” she explained to the Duke, who had risen. Then she turned to\nher husband a bright-eyed glance: “You don't mind--our coming?” she\nasked.\n\n“Mind!” he called out, with robust impressiveness. “Mind!” As if to\ncomplete the expression of his meaning, he threw his arm loosely\nabout her, where she stood, and brought her to his side. They remained\nstanding thus, before the fireplace, after the others were all seated.\n\n“Mr. Thorpe has been outlining to me the most wonderful plans,” said the\nDuke, looking from one face to another, with a reserved smile. “It\nseems that philanthropy fails unless it is combined with very advanced\npolitics. It is a new idea to me--but he certainly states it with\nvigour. Do you understand it, Edith?”\n\n“Oh, perfectly,” replied the wife, smilingly. “I am his first convert.\nBehold in me the original disciple.”\n\n“The worst of that is,” commented Thorpe, with radiant joviality, “she\nwould subscribe to any other new doctrine of mine just as readily.” He\ntightened the arm encircling her by a perceptible trifle. “Wouldn't you,\nsweetheart?” he demanded.\n\nShe seemed in nowise embarrassed by these overt endearments.\nThere was indeed the dimmest suggestion in her face and voice of a\nresponsive mood. “Really,” she began, with a soft glance,\nhalf-deprecation, half-pride, bent upon the others, and with thoughtful\ndeliberation,--“really the important thing is that he should pursue some\nobject--have in view something that he is determined to master. Without\nthat, he is not contented--not at his best. He should have been a\nsoldier. He has a passion for battle in his blood. And now that he sees\nsomething he is eager to do--I am very glad. It makes it none the less\nacceptable that good is to come from it.”\n\n“I still maintain,” said Miss Madden, interpolating her words through\nthe task of lighting a cigarette, and contriving for them an effect of\ndrollery which appealed to Thorpe most of all--“I shall always insist,\njust the same, that crime was his true vocation.”",
