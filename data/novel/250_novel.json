 "text": "A Brief History of the Internet\nThe Bright Side:  The Dark Side\nby Michael Hart with Max Fuller\n\n(C)1995, Released on March 8th, 1995\n\n\nChapter 00  Preface\n\n\nThe Internet Conquers Space, Time, and Mass Production...\n\nMichael Hart called it NeoMass Production [TM] in 1971...\nand published the U.S. Declaration of Independence on the\nand no one was listening...or were they?\n???careful!!!!\nIf the governments, universities or colleges of the world\nwanted people to be educated, they certainly could have a\ncopy of things like the Declaration of Independence where\neveryone could get an electronic copy.  After all, it has\nbeen over 25 years since the Internet began as government\nfunded projects among our universities, and only 24 years\nsince the Declaration was posted, followed by the Bill of\nRights, Constitution, the Bible, Shakespeare, etc.\n\nWhy do more people get their electronic books from others\nthan these institutions when they spend a TRILLION DOLLAR\nBUDGET EVERY YEAR pretending their goal is some universal\nform of education.\n\n\n\nThis is the story of the Bright Side and Dark Side of\nthe Internet. . .Bright Side first.\n\n\n\nThe Facts:\n\n\nThe Internet is a primitive version of the \"Star Trek\nCommunicator,\" the \"Star Trek Transporter,\" and, also\na primitive version of the \"Star Trek Replicator.\"\n\n\nCommunicator\n\nThe Internet \"let's\" you talk to anyone on the Earth,\nas long as they, too, are on the Internet.\n\n\nTransporter\n\nThe Internet \"let's\" you transport anything you would\nbe able to get into your computer to any Netter.\n\n\nReplicator\n\nThe Internet \"let's\" you replicate anything anyone is\nable to get into their computer, from \"The Mona Lisa\"\nto \"The Klein Bottle\" if you use the right \"printer,\"\nand the library never closes, the books are always on\nthe shelves, never checked out, lost, in for binding,\nand there is never an overdue fine because you never,\never, have to take them back.\n\n\n\nThe Bright Side and the Dark Side\n\n\nFor the first time in the entire history of the Earth, we\nhave the ability for EVERYONE to get copies of EVERYTHING\nas long as it can be digitized and communicated to all of\nthe people on the Earth, via computers [and the devices a\nperson might need to make a PHYSICAL, rather than VIRTUAL\ncopy of whatever it might be. . .\n\nThink about what you have just read for a moment, please,\nEVERYTHING FOR EVERYONE. . .\n\nas long as the Information Superhighway is not taken over\nby the INFORMATION RICH and denied access to others other\nthan for a fee they may not be able to pay, and shouldn't\nhave to pay. . .since the INFORMATION RICH have had rides\nfor free for the first 25 years of the Internet.]\n\nFrom 1969 to 1994, most of the traffic on the Information\nSuperhighway was generated by individuals who did not pay\ntolls to get on the ramps to the Information Superhighway\n. . .in fact, ALL of the early users were paid to get on,\nexcept one. . .they were paid. . .BY YOU!\n\nMichael Hart may have been the first person who got on as\na private individual, not paid by any of the 23 nodes, or\nthe Internet/ARPANet system, for his work; but who at the\ntime of this publication might have given away 25 billion\nworth of Etexts in return for his free network access.\n\n[i.e. Mr. Hart was the first \"normal\" person to have this\naccess to the Internet, a first non-computer-professional\nfor social responsibility; \"We should provide information\nto all persons, without delay. . .simply because WE CAN!\"\nJust like climbing Mount Everest or going into space, and\nthis is so much cheaper and less dangerous.\n\n[For those of you considering asking that his accesses be\nrevoked, he has received permission from CCSO management,\npreviously CSO as indicated in his email address, for the\nposting of this document and has also received permission\nfrom several other colleges and/or universities, at which\nhe has computer accounts and/or is affiliated.]\n\n\nIn the beginning, all the messages on the Net were either\nhardware or software crash messages, people looking for a\nhelping hand in keeping their mainframes up and running--\nand that was about it for the first 10-15 years of cyber-\nspace. . .cyber-space. . .mostly just space. . .there was\nnothing really in it for anyone, but mainframe operators,\nprogrammers, and a few computer consultants who worked in\nmulti-state regions because there weren't enough computer\ninstallations in any single state, not even California or\nIllinois, to keep a computer consultant in business.\n\n\nThe Bright Side\n\nMr. Hart had a vision in 1971 that the greatest purpose a\ncomputer network would ever provide would be the storage,\ntransmission, and copying of the library of information a\nwhole planet of human beings would generate.  These ideas\nwere remarkably ahead of their time, as attested to by an\nIndependent Plans of Study Degree in the subject of Human\nMachine Interfaces from the University of Illinois, 1973.\nThis degree, and the publications of the first few Etexts\n[Electronic Texts] on the Internet, began the process the\nInternet now knows as Project Gutenberg, which has caught\nfire and spread to all areas of the Internet, and spawned\nseveral generations of \"Information Providers,\" as we now\nhave come to call them.\n\nIt is hard to log in to the Internet without finding many\nreferences to Project Gutenberg and Information Providers\nthese days, but you might be surprised just how much of a\nplethora of information stored on the Internet is only on\nline for LIMITED DISTRIBUTION even though the information\nis actually in the PUBLIC DOMAIN and has been paid for in\nmoney paid by your taxes, and by grants, which supposedly\nare given for the betterments of the human race, not just\na favored few at the very top 1% of the INFORMATION RICH.\n\nMany of you have seen the publicity announcements of such\ngrants in the news media, and an information professional\nsees them all the time.\n\nYou may have seen grants totalling ONE BILLION DOLLARS to\ncreate \"Electronic Libraries;\" what you haven't seen is a\nsingle \"Electronic Book\" released into the Public Domain,\nin any form for you to use, from any one of these.\n\n\n\n\nThe Dark Side\n\nWhy don't you see huge electronic libraries available for\ndownload from the Internet?\n\nWhy are the most famous universities in the world working\non electronic libraries and you can't read the books?\n\nIf it costs $1,000 to create an electronic book through a\ngovernment or foundation grant, then $1,000,000,000 funds\nfor electronic libraries should easily create a 1,000,000\nvolume electronic library in no time at all.\n\nAfter all, if someone paid YOU $1,000 to type, scan or to\notherwise get a public domain book onto the Internet, you\ncould do that in no time at all, and so could one million\nother people, and they could probably do it in a week, if\nthey tried really hard, maybe in a month if they only did\nit in their spare time.  For $1,000 per book, I am sure a\nfew people would be turning out a book a week for as long\nas it took to get all million books into electronic text.\n\nThere has been perhaps ONE BILLION DOLLARS granted for an\nelectronic library in a variety of places, manners, types\nand all other diversities; IF THE COST IS ONE THOUSAND OF\nTHOSE DOLLARS TO CREATE A SINGLE ELECTRONIC BOOK, THEN WE\nSHOULD HAVE ONE MILLION BOOKS ONLINE FOR EVERYONE TO USE.\n\n\n\nHOW HAS THIS PROCESS BEEN STOPPED?\n\nAnyone who wants to stop this process for a Public Domain\nLibrary of information is probably suffering from several\nof the Seven Deadly Sins:\n\nPride, covetousness, lust, anger, greed, envy, and sloth.\nMerriam Webster Third International Unabridged Dictionary\n[Above:  Greed = Gluttony, and moved back one place]\n\n[Below:  my simple descriptions of the Seven Deadly Sins]\n\n1.  Pride:  I have one and you don't.\n\n2.  Covetousness:  Mine is worth more if you don't have a\n    copy or something similar.  I want yours.  I want the\n    one you have, even if I already have one or many.\n\n3.  Lust:  I have to have it.\n\n4.  Anger:  I will hurt you to ensure that I have it, and\n    and to ensure that you do not have one.\n\n5.  Envy:  I hate that you have one.\n\n6.  Greed:  There is no end to how much I want, or to how\n    little I want you to have in comparison.\n\n7.  Sloth:  I am opposed to you moving up the ladder:  it\n    means that I will have to move up the ladder, to keep\n    my position of lordship over you.  If I have twice as\n    much as you do, and you gain a rung, that means I can\n    only regain my previous lordship by moving up two; it\n    is far easier to knock you back a rung, or to prevent\n    you from climbing at all.\n\n    Destruction is easier than construction.\n\n    This becomes even more obvious for the person who has\n    a goal of being 10 or 100 times further up the ladder\n    of success. . .given the old, and hopefully obsolete,\n    or soon to be obsolete, definitions of success.\n\n    \"If I worked like a fiend all my life to ensure I had\n    a thousand dollars for every dollar you had, and then\n  someone came along and wanted to give everyone $1000,\n  then I would be forced to work like a fiend again, to\n  get another million dollars to retain my position.\"\n\n  Think about it:  someone spends a lifetime achieving,\n  creating, or otherwise investing their life, building\n  a talent, an idea, or a physical manifestation of the\n  life they have led. . .the destruction of this is far\n  easier than the construction. . .just as the building\n  of a house is much more difficult, requires training,\n  discipline, knowledge of the laws of physics to get a\n  temperature and light balance suitable for latitudes,\n  etc., etc., etc.\n\n  But nearly anyone can burn down a building, or a pile\n  of books without a fraction of this kind of training.\n\n  People are used to lording it over others by building\n  and writing certain items that reflect their lordship\n  over themselves, their environments, and, last/least,\n  over other people.  If they were not engaged in power\n  over themselves [self-discipline, education, etc,] or\n  over their environments [food, clothing and shelter],\n  then they have only other people to have control over\n  and that is the problem.  They don't want other people\n  to have it easier than they did.  \"If _I_ did it with\n  the hard ways and tools of the past, then _YOU_ would\n  threaten me if you use some easier ways and tools the\n  present has to offer, and _I_ don't want to learn the\n  new tools, since I have invested my whole life to the\n  mastery of the old tools.\"  I have literally met very\n  highly placed souls in the system of higher education\n  who have told me they will quit the system on the day\n  they have to use email because it removes the control\n  they used to have over physical meetings, phone calls\n  and the paper mails.  It is just too obvious if a big\n  wig is not answering your email, since email programs\n  can actually tell you the second it was delivered and\n  also the second the person \"opened\" it.\n\n  This is why SOME people fear the new Internet:  other\n  people fear it NOT because they lose the kind of lord\n  position that comes with OWNERSHIP; rather they fear,\n  in a similar manner, they will lose the CONTROL which\n  they have used to achieve their position of lordship,\n  such as one kind of professor mentioned below.\n\n    *****As Hart's DOS prompt sometimes states:*****\n\n    \"Money is how people with no talent keep score!\"\n  \"Control is how others with no money keep score!\"\n\n\nThese Seven Deadly Sins, while named by various names and\nby most civilizations, have nonetheless often been actual\nlaws; in that certain people were required, by law, to be\nvictims of the rest of their populations in that a person\nmight be legally denied ownership of any property, due to\nracism or sexism, or denied the right to a contract, even\nlegally denied the ability to read and write, not just an\nassortment of rights to vote, contract and own property--\nthere have even been laws that forbade any but the \"upper\ncrust\" to wear certain types of clothing, a \"statement of\nfashion\" of a slightly different order than we see today,\nbut with similar ends.\n\nYou might want to look up laws that once divided this and\nother countries by making it illegal to teach any persons\nof certain races or genders reading, writing, arithmetic,\nand others of the ways human beings learn to have a power\nover their environments.\n\nPower over oneself is the first kind of power...if you do\nnot control yourself, you will find difficulty in control\nof anything.\n\nPower over the environment is the second kind of power...\nif you do not control food, clothing and shelter, you are\ngoing to have a hard time controlling anything else.\n\nPower over other human being is the third kind of power--\ndescribed above in the Seven Deadly Sins, a third raters'\nkind of power.  Those who cannot control anything else...\nmust, by definition, have others control things for them.\nIf they don't want to depend on the voluntary cooperation\nof others, then they must find some way to control them.\n\nWe are now seeing the efforts by those who couldn't BUILD\nthe Internet to control it, and the 40 million people who\nare on it; people from the goverment to big business, who\nfeel \"Freedom Is Slavery\" or at least dangerous; and, who\nfeel the Internet is the \"NEXT COMMERCIAL FRONTIER\" where\ncustomers are all ready to be inundated with advertising,\nmore cheaply than with junkmail.  Fortunately some of the\nother Internet pioneers have developed ways of preventing\nthis sort of thing from happening BUT I am sure we aren't\nfar from lawsuits by the cash rich and information rich,\ncomplaining that they can't get their junkemail into \"my\"\nemailbox.  We will probably all be forced to join into an\nassortment of \"protectives\" in which we subscribe to such\n\"killbots\" as are required to let in the mail we want and\nkeep out the junkemail.\n\nThese same sorts of protectives were forming a century or\nso before the Internet, in a similar response to the hard\nmonopolistic pricing policies of the railroads which went\ntranscontinental just 100 years before this Internet did.\n\nI suggest you look up Grange in your encyclopedias, where\none of them says:\n\n\"The National Grange is the popular name\nof the Order of the Patrons of Husbandry,\nthe oldest general farm organization\nin the United States. . .formed largely\nthrough the efforts of Oliver Hudson Kelley,\na Minnesota farmer who was deeply affected\nby the poverty and isolation of the farmers\nhe saw will inspecting farm areas in the South\nfor the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1866.\nIn the 1870's the Grange was prominent in\nthe broader Granger movement, which campaigned\nagainst extortionate charges by monopolistic\nrailroads and warehouses and helped bring\nabout laws regulating these charges. . . .\nAlthough challenged, the constitutionality\nof such laws was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court\nin Munn v. Illinois (1877).\n\n[1994 Grolier Electronic Enyclcopedia]\n\n***\n\nThe Internet Conquers Space, Time and Mass Production\n\nThe Internet is a primitive version of the \"Star Trek\nCommunicator,\" the \"Star Trek Transporter,\" and, also\na primitive version of the \"Star Trek Replicator.\"\n\nThe Internet \"let's\" you talk to anyone on the Earth,\nas long as they, too, are on the Internet.\n\nThe Internet \"let's\" you transport anything you would\nbe able to get into your computer to any Netter.\n\nThe Internet \"let's\" you replicate anything anyone is\nable to get into their computer, from \"The Mona Lisa\"\nto \"The Klein Bottle\" if you use the right \"printer.\"\n\nDon't forget the \"SneakerNet\" is part of the Internet\nand let's you get information to or from those who do\nnot have direct Internet connections.  SneakerNet was\na term developed to describe the concept of sending a\nfile to someone nearby the person you wanted, and the\nperson would then put on his/her sneakers and run the\ndisk down the street for you.  From my experience, it\nwas incredibly obvious that SneakerNet traversed from\nEast to West and West to East around the world before\nthe Internet did, as I received letters from the East\nand West as the Project Gutenberg Alice in Wonderland\nEtext circled the globe long before the Internet did.\n\nThis is very important to know if you consider that a\npossible future development might keep you from using\nthe Internet for this, due to socio-political motions\nto turn the Internet into a \"World Wide Mall\" [WWM] a\nterm coined specifically to describe that moneymaking\nphilosophy that says \"Even if it has been given away,\nfree of charge, to 90% of the users for 25 years, our\ngoal is to make sure we change it from an Information\nSuperhighway to an Information Supertollway.\n\nI said \"let's\" you do the Star Trek Communicator, and\nTransporter, and Replicator functions because it will\nsoon be obvious that those \"Information Rich\" who had\nfree access to the Internet for so long want to do an\nInternet Monopoly thing to ensure that what was free,\nto the Information Rich, will no longer be free for a\nclass of the Information Poor.\n\nThis is serious business, and if you consider that it\nwould cost the 40 million Netters about $25 per month\nto \"subscribe\" to the Information Rich version of the\nInternet, that means one thousand million dollars per\nmonth going into the hands of the Information Rich at\nthe expense of the Information Poor; we would shortly\nbe up to our virtual ears in a monopoly that would be\non the order of the one recently broken up in a major\nanti-trust and anti-monopoly actions against the hand\nof the telephone company.\n\nHopefully, if we see it coming we can prevent it now,\nbut it will take far more power than _I_ have.\n\nPeople will tell you \"No one can own the Internet!\"--\nbut the fact is that while you may own your computer,\nyou do not \"Own the Internet\" any more than owning my\nown telephones or PBX exchanges means I own telephone\nnetworks that belong to The Telephone Companies.  The\ncorporations that own the physical wires and cabling,\nthey are the ones who own the Internet, and right now\nthat system is being sold to The Telephone Companies,\nand your \"rights\" to the Information Superhighway are\nbeing sold with them.\n\nThe goal of giving 10,000 books to everyone on Earth,\nwhich we at Project Gutenberg have been trying to do,\nvirtually since the start of the Internet, is in huge\ndanger of becoming just another tool for those we are\nbecoming enslaved by on the Internet, and these books\nmight never get into the high schools:  much less the\nmiddle schools and grade schools because the Trillion\ndollars we spend on educations with the rise and fall\nof every Congress of the United States isn't meant to\neducate, it is meant for something else.  After all--\nif a Trillion dollars were really being spent on this\nprocess of education every two years, should literacy\nrates have plummeted to 53% and college level testing\nscores fallen for many straight years?\n\n[Oh yes, I heard yesterday's report the tests were up\nfor the first time in decades. . .but what I did NOT!\nhear was ANY reference to the fact that the score was\n\"inflated\" not only by the \"normal\" free 200 points a\nperson gets for just being able to sign their names--\nbut by an additional 22 points for math, 76 verbal.]\n[Written February 5th, 1995]\n\nThis kind of \"grade inflation\" has been going on in a\nsimilar, though less official manner, in our schools,\nfor decades.  There are schools in which the averages\nindicate more \"A\"s are given out than all other grade\npoints combined, not just more \"A\"s than \"B\"s or \"B\"s\nthan \"C\"s.  Some of the most importanted studies were\nnever published, even though they were tax funded.\n\nWatch out, the term \"grade inflation\" is \"politically\nincorrect\" to such a degree that it does not appear a\nsingle time in any of the encyclopedias I have tried,\nalthough it does appear in my Random House Unabridged\nand College Dictionaries, but not the Merriam-Webster\nNinth New College Dictionary, American Heritage or in\nany other references I have searched.  Please tell me\nif you find it in any.\n\n\"The awarding of higher grades than students deserve\neither to maintain a school's academic reputation or\nas a result of diminished teacher expectations.\"\n[1980-1985]\n\nI can personally tell you this was a huge concern in\n1970-1975 when the average grade at some colleges in\nquestion had already passed the point mentioned just\nabove, yielding averages including all undergraduate\ncourses, including the grades of \"flunk-outs,\" still\nhigher than a \"B\" which means more \"A\"s were given a\nwhole undergraduate student body than \"B\"s and \"C\"s.\n[Actually it means worse than that, but point made.]\n\nSo, we reached the point at which large numbers of a\nnation's high school graduates couldn't even read or\nfill out a minimum wage job application form, while,\non paper, we were doing better than ever, excepting,\nthank God, the fact that testing scores showed there\nwas something incredibly wrong, and businesses would\nnotice they were having to interview more people for\na job before they could find someone to fill it.\n\n\nThis is what happens when we separate a country into the\n\"Information Rich\" and the \"Information Poor.\"\n\nDon't let it happen to the entire world.\n\nFor the first time in ALL history, we have the chance to\nensure that every person can put huge amounts of \"Public\nDomain\" and other information into computers that should\nbe as inexpensive as calculators in a few more years.  I\nwould like to ensure these people actually have material\nto put in those computers when they get them.\n\nExample:\n\nSome Shakespeare professors believe that the way to be a\ngreat Shakespeare professor is to know something about a\nShakespeare play or poem that no one else knows.\n\nTherefore they never tell anyone, and that knowledge can\nquite possibly die with them if it is never published in\na wide manner.  Example:  Damascus steel was famous, for\nhundreds of years, but the knowledge of how to make this\nsteel was so narrowly known that all those who knew that\ntechnique died without passing it on, and it was a truly\nlong time before computer simulations finally managed to\nrecreate Damascus steel after all those centuries when a\nperson had to buy an antique to get any.\n\nSome other Shakespeare professors believe that the way a\nperson should act to be a great Shakespeare professor is\nto teach as many people as possible about Shakespeare in\nas complete a manner as they want to learn.\n\nThe Internet is balancing on this same dichotomy now....\n\nDo we want Unlimited Distribution...\n\nOr do we want to continue with Limited Distribution?\n\nThe French have just given us one of the great examples:\na month or so ago [I am writing this in early February.]\nthey found a cave containing the oldest known paintings,\ntwice as old as any previously discovered, and after the\ninitial month of photographing them in secret, placed an\nelectronic set of photographs on the Internet for all of\nus to have. . .ALL!\n\nThis is in GREAT contradistinction to the way things had\nbeen done around the time I was born, when the \"Dead Sea\nScrolls\" were discovered, and none of you ever saw them,\nor any real description of them, until a few years ago--\nin case you are wondering when, I was born in 1947; this\nis being published on my 48th birthday when I officially\nbecome \"old.\"  [As a mathematician, I don't cheat, and I\nadmit that if you divide a 72 year lifespan into equals,\nyou only get 24 years to be young, 24 years to be middle\naged, and 24 years to be old. . .after that you have the\nodds beaten.  If you divide the US into young and old, a\nperson has to be considered \"old\" at 34, since 33 is the\nmedian age [meaning half the people are younger than 33,\nand half the people are older.  The median Internet age?\n26.  Median Web age 31.  Some predictions indicate these\nwill decrease until the median Internet age is 15.\n\nWho will rule the Internet?\n\nWill it be the Internet Aristocrats...\n\nor an Internet Everyman?\n\nThe difference is whether the teacher or scholar lording\nit over others is our example, or the teacher or scholar\nwho teaches as well and as many as possible.  We SAY our\npeople should have and must have universal education yet\nwith test scores and literacy rates in a tailspin it can\nobvious that we have anything BUT a widest universalness\nof primary and secondary education program in mind.  Not\nto leave out college education, which has been known for\nthe graduation of people who were totally illiterate.\n\nFor the first time we actually have an opportunity for a\nwhole world's population to share not only air or water,\nbut also to share the world of ideas, of art or of music\nand other sounds. . .anything that can be digitized.\n\nDo you remember what the first protohumans did in \"2001\"\n[the movie by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark] ?\n\nThey chased their neighbors away from the water hole.\n\nWill let the Thought Police chase us away from this huge\nwatering hole, just so they can charge us admission, for\nsomething our tax dollars have already paid for?\n\nThe Internet Conquers Space, Time and Mass Production...\n\nThink of the time and effort people save simply by being\nable to consult a dictionary, an encyclopedia, thesaurus\nor other reference book, a newspaper or magazine library\nof vast proportions, or a library of a thousand books of\nthe greatest works of all history without even having to\nget up and go to the bookcase.\n\nThink of the simple increase in education just because a\nperson can and will look up more information, judgements\nbecome sharper and more informed....\n\nUnless someone believes that good judgement, an informed\npopulation, and their effects are their enemies, it is a\ndifficult stretch to understand why certain institutions\nand people want to limit this flow of information.\n\nYet a great number of our institutions, and even some of\nthe people who run them, are against this kind of easily\navailable information...they either want to control it--\nor they want to maintain their \"leadership\" in fields of\nendeavor by making sure we \"have to do it the hard way,\"\nsimply because they did it the hard way.\n\nThere is no longer any reason to \"do it the hard way\" as\nyou will see below, and on the Internet.\n\n\nEnd of the Preface to \"A Brief History of the Internet.\"\n\n\n\n\nChapter 0\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nMichael Hart is trying to change Human Nature.\n\nHe says Human Nature is all that is stopping the Internet\nfrom saving the world.\n\nThe Internet, he says, is a primitive combination of Star\nTrek communicators, transporters and replicators; and can\nand will bring nearly everything to nearly everyone.\n\n\"I type in Shakespeare and everyone, everywhere, and from\nnow until the end of history as we know it--everyone will\nhave a copy instantaneously, on request.  Not only books,\nbut the pictures, paintings, music. . .anything that will\nbe digitized. . .which will eventually include it all.  A\nfew years ago I wrote some articles about 3-D replication\n[Stereographic Lithography] in which I told of processes,\nin use today, that videotaped and played back fastforward\non a VCR, look just like something appearing in Star Trek\nreplicators.  Last month I saw an article about a stove a\nperson could program from anyhere on the Internet. . .you\ncould literally `fax someone a pizza' or other meals, the\n`faxing a pizza' being a standard joke among Internetters\nfor years, describing one way to tell when the future can\nbe said to have arrived.\"\n\nFor a billion or so people who own or borrow computers it\nmight be said \"The Future Is Now\" because they can get at\n250 Project Gutenberg Electronic Library items, including\nShakespeare, Beethoven, and Neil Armstrong landing on the\nMoon in the same year the Internet was born.\n\nThis is item #250, and we hope it will save the Internet,\nand the world. . .and not be a futile, quixotic effort.\n\nLet's face it, a country with an Adult Illiteracy Rate of\n47% is not nearly as likely to develop a cure for AIDS as\na country with an Adult Literacy Rate of 99%.\n\nHowever, Michael Hart says the Internet has changed a lot\nin the last year, and not in the direction that will take\nthe Project Gutenberg Etexts into the homes of the 47% of\nthe adult population of the United States that is said to\nbe functionally illiterate by the 1994 US Report on Adult\nLiteracy.  He has been trying to ensure that there is not\ngoing to be an \"Information Rich\" and \"Information Poor,\"\nas a result of a Feudal Dark Ages approach to this coming\n\"Age of Information\". . .he has been trying since 1971, a\nvirtual \"First Citizen\" of the Internet since he might be\nthe first person on the Internet who was NOT paid to work\non the Internet/ARPANet or its member computers.\n\n\nFlashback\n\nIn either case, he was probably one of the first 100 on a\nfledgling Net and certainly the first to post information\nof a general nature for others on the Net to download; it\nwas the United States' Declaration of Independence.  This\nwas followed by the U.S. Bill of Rights, and then a whole\nEtext of the U.S. Constitution, etc.  You might consider,\njust for the ten minutes the first two might require, the\nreading of the first two of these documents that were put\non the Internet starting 24 years ago:  and maybe reading\nthe beginning of the third.\n\nThe people who provided his Internet account thought this\nwhole concept was nuts, but the files didn't take a whole\nlot of space, and the 200th Anniversary of the Revolution\n[of the United States against England] was coming up, and\nparchment replicas of all the Revolution's Documents were\nfound nearly everywhere at the time.  The idea of putting\nthe Complete Works of Shakespeare, the Bible, the Q'uran,\nand more on the Net was still pure Science Fiction to any\nbut Mr. Hart at the time.  For the first 17 years of this\nproject, the only responses received were of the order of\n\"You want to put Shakespeare on a computer!?  You must be\nNUTS!\" and that's where it stayed until the \"Great Growth\nSpurt\" hit the Internet in 1987-88.  All of a sudden, the\nInternet hit \"Critical Mass\" and there were enough people\nto start a conversation on nearly any subject, including,\nof all things, electronic books, and, for the first time,\nProject Gutenberg received a message saying the Etext for\neveryone concept was a good idea.\n\nThat watershed event caused a ripple effect.  With others\nfinally interested in Etext, a \"Mass Marketing Approach,\"\nand such it was, was finally appropriate, and the release\nof Alice in Wonderland and Peter Pan signalled beginnings\nof a widespread production and consumption of Etexts.  In\nAppendix A you will find a listing of these 250, in order\nof their release.\n\nVolunteers began popping up, right on schedule, to assist\nin the creation or distribution of what Project Gutenberg\nhoped would be 10,000 items by the end of 2001, only just\n30 years after the first Etext was posted on the Net.\n\n\n\nFlash Forward\n\nToday there are about 500 volunteers at Project Gutenberg\nand they are spread all over the globe, from people doing\ntheir favorite book then never being heard from again, to\nPhD's, department heads, vice-presidents, and lawyers who\ndo reams of copyright research, and some who have done in\nexcess of 20 Etexts pretty much by themselves; appreciate\nis too small a word for how Michael feel about these, and\ntears would be the only appropriate gesture.\n\n\nThere are approximately 400 million computers today, with\nthe traditional 1% of them being on the Internet, and the\ntraditional ratio of about 10 users per Internet node has\ncontinued, too, as there are about 40 million people on a\nvast series of Internet gateways.  Ratios like these have\nbeen a virtual constant through Internet development.\n\nIf there is only an average of 2.5 people on each of 400M\ncomputers, that is a billion people, just in 1995.  There\nwill probably be a billion computers in the world by 2001\nwhen Project Gutenberg hopes to have 10,000 items online.\n\nIf only 10% of those computers contain the average Etexts\nfrom Project Gutenberg that will mean Project Gutenberg's\ngoal of giving away one trillion Etexts will be completed\nat that time, not counting that more than one person will\nbe able to use any of these copies.  If the average would\nstill be 2.5 people per computer, then only 4% of all the\ncomputers would be required to have reached one trillion.\n\n[10,000 Etexts to 100,000,000 people equals one trillion]\n\nHart's dream as adequately expressed by \"Grolier's\" CDROM\nElectronic Encyclopedia has been his signature block with\npermission, for years, but this idea is now threatened by\nthose who feel threatened by Unlimited Distribution:\n\n\n=====================================================\n|       The trend of library policy is clearly toward\n|       the ideal of making all information available\n|       without delay to all people.\n|\n|The Software Toolworks Illustrated Encyclopedia (TM)\n|(c) 1990, 1991 Grolier Electronic Publishing, Inc.\n\n=============================================\n\nMichael S.

When there is a\nbig surplus, trade routes begin to open up, civilizations\nbegin to expand, and good times are had by all.  When the\nhuge surplus is NOT present, the first three estates lord\nit over the rest in virtually the same manner as historic\nfigures have done through the ages:\n\n\"I have got this and you don't.\" [Nyah nyah naa naa naa!]\n\n***\n***\n\nNow that ownership of the basic library of human thoughts\nis potentially available to every human being on Earth--I\nhave been watching the various attempts to keep this from\nactually being available to everyone on the planet:  this\nis what I have seen:\n\n1.  Ridicule\n\nThose who would prefer to think their worlds would be\ndestroyed by infinite availability of books such as:\nAlice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Aesop's Fables or the\nComplete Works of Shakespeare, Milton or others, have\nridiculed the efforts of those who would give them to\nall free of charge by arguing about whether it should\nbe:  \"To be or not to be\" or \"To be [,] or not to be\"\nor  \"To be [;] or not to be\"/\"To be [:] or not to be\"\nor whatever; and that whatever their choices are, for\nthis earthshaking matter, that no other choice should\nbe possible to anyone else.  My choice of editions is\nfinal because _I_ have a scholarly opinion.\n\n1A.  My response has been to refuse to discuss:  \"How\nmany angels can dance on the head of a pin,\" [or many\nother matters of similar importance].\n\nI know this was once considered of utmost importance,\nBUT IN A COUNTRY WHERE HALF THE ADULTS COULD NOT EVEN\nREAD SHAKESPEARE IF IT WERE GIVEN TO THEM, I feel the\ngeneral literacy and literary requirements overtake a\ndecision such as theirs.  If they honestly wanted the\nbest version of Shakespeare [in their estimations] to\nbe the default version on the Internet, they wouldn't\nhave refused to create just such an edition, wouldn't\nhave shot down my suggested plan to help them make it\n. . .for so many years. . .nor, when they finally did\nagree, they wouldn't have let an offer from a largest\nwannabee Etext provider to provide them with discount\nprices, and undermine their resolve to create a super\nquality public domain edition of Shakespeare.  It was\nan incredible commentary on the educational system in\nthat the Shakespeare edition we finally did use for a\nstandard Internet Etext was donated by a commercial--\nyes--commercial vendor, who sells it for a living.\n\nIn fact, I must state for the record, that education,\nas an institution, has had very little to do with the\ncreation and distribution of Public Domain Etexts for\nthe public, and that contributions by the commercial,\ncapitalistic corporations has been the primary force,\nby a large margin, that funds Project Gutenberg.  The\n500 volunteers we have come exclusively from smaller,\nless renowned institutions of education, without any,\nnot one that I can think of, from any of the major or\nnear major educational institutions of the world.\n\nIt would appear that those Seven Deadly Sins listed a\nfew paragraphs previously have gone a long way to the\nproof of the saying that \"Power corrupts and absolute\npower corrupts absolutely.\"\n\nPower certainly accrues to those who covet it and the\nproof of the pudding is that all of the powerful club\nwe have approached have refused to assist in the very\nnew concept of truly Universal Education.\n\nMembers of those top educational institutions managed\nto subscribe to our free newsletter often enough, but\nnot one of them ever volunteered to do a book or even\nto donate a dollar for what they have received:  even\nsend in lists of errors they say they have noticed.\n\nNot one.  [There is a word for the act of complaining\nabout something without [literally] lifting a finger]\n\nThe entire body of freely available Etexts has been a\nproduct of the \"little people.\"\n\n\n\n2.  Cost Inflation\n\nWhen Etexts were first coming it, estimates were sent\naround the Internet that it took $10,000 to create an\nEtexts, and that therefore it would take $100,000,000\nto create the proposed Project Gutenberg Library.\n\n$500,000,000 was supposedly donated to create Etexts,\nby one famous foundation, duly reported by the media,\nbut these Etexts have not found their way into hands,\nor minds, of the public, nor will they very soon I am\nafraid, though I would love to be put out of business\n[so to say] by the act of these institutions' release\nof the thousands of Etexts some of them already have,\nand that others have been talking about for years.\n\nMy response was, has been, and will be, simply to get\nthe Etexts out there, on time, and with no budget.  A\nsimple proof that the problem does not exist.  If the\nteam of Project Gutenberg volunteers can produce this\nnumber of Etexts and provide it to the entire world's\ncomputerized population, then the zillions of dollars\nyou hear being donated to the creations of electronic\nlibraries by various government and private donations\nshould be used to keep the Information Superhighway a\nfree and productive place for all, not just for those\n1% of computers that have already found a home there.\n\n\n\n3.  Graphics and Markup versus Plain Vanilla ASCII\n\nThe one thing you will see in common with ALL of such\ngraphics and markup proposals is LIMITED DISTRIBUTION\nas a way of life.  The purpose of each one of these is\nand always has been to keep knowledge in the hands of\nthe few and away from the minds of the many.\n\nI predict that in the not-too-distant-future that all\nmaterials will either be circulating on the Internet,\nor that they will be jealously guarded by owners whom\nI described with the Seven Deadly Sins.\n\nIf there is ever such a thing as the \"Tri-corder,\" of\nStar Trek fame, I am sure there simultaneously has to\nbe developed a \"safe\" in which those who don't want a\nwhole population to have what they have will \"lock\" a\nvaluable object to ensure its uniqueness; the concept\nof which I am speaking is illustrated by this story:\n\n\"A butler announces a delivery, by very distinguished\nmembers of a very famous auction house.  The master--\nfor he IS master--beckons him to his study desk where\nthe butler deposits his silver tray, containing a big\ntriangular stamp, then turns to go.\n\n\n\nWhat some of these projects with tens of millions for\ntheir \"Electronic Libraries\" are doing to ensure this\nis for THEM and not for everyone is to prepare Etexts\nin a manner in which no normal person would either be\nwilling or able to read them.\n\nShakespeare's Hamlet is a tiny file in PVASCII, small\nenough for half a dozen copies to fit [uncompressed!]\non a $.23 floppy disk that fits in your pocket.  But,\nif it is preserved as a PICTURE of each page, then it\nwill take so much space that it would be difficult to\ncarry around even a single copy in that pocket unless\nit were on a floppy sized optical disk, and even then\nI don't think it would fit.\n\nAnother way to ensure no normal person would read it,\nto mark it up so blatantly that the human eyes should\nhave difficulty in scansion, stuttering around pages,\nrather than sliding easily over them; the information\ncontained in this \"markup\" is deemed crucial by those\nesoteric scholars who think it is of vital importance\nthat a coffee cup stain appears at the lower right of\na certain page, and that \"Act I\" be followed by [<ACT\nONE>] to ensure everyone knows this is actually where\nthis is where an act or scene or whatever starts.\n\nYou probably would not believe how much money has had\nthe honor of being spent on these kinds of projects a\nnormal person is intentionlly deprived of through the\nmixture is just plain HIDING the files, to making the\nfiles so BIG you can't download them, to making them\nso WEIRD you wouldn't read them if you got them.  The\nconcept of requiring all documents to be formatted in\na certain manner such that only a certain program can\nread them has been proposed more often then you might\never want to imagine, for the TWIN PURPOSES OF PROFIT\nAND LIMITED DISTRIBUTION in a medium which requires a\nvirtue of UNLIMITED DISTRIBUTION to keep it growing.\n\nEvery day I read articles, proposals, proceedings for\nvarious conferences that promote LIMITED DISTRIBUTION\non the Nets. . .simply to raise the prestige or money\nto keep some small oligarchy in power.\n\nThis is truly a time of POWER TO THE PEOPLE as people\nsay in the United States.\n\nWhat we have here is a conflict between the concepts that\neverything SHOULD be in LIMITED DISTRIBUTION, and that of\nthe opposing concept of UNLIMITED DISTRIBUTION.\n\nIf you look over the table of contents on the next pages,\nyou will see that each of these item stresses the greater\nand greater differences between an history which has been\ndedicated to the preservation of Limited Distribution and\nsomething so new it has no history longer than 25 years--\n\n***\n\nContents\n\n\nChapter 00\n\nPreface\n\n\nChapter 0\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nSaving Time and Effort\n\nThe New Scholarship\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nGeneral Comments\n\nPlain Vanilla ASCII Versus Proprietary Markups\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nCopyright\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nLuddites\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nInternet As Chandelier\n[The Famous Chandelier Diatribe of 1990]\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Rush To The Top\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThose Who Would Be King\n\nGopher, WWW, Mosaic, Netscape\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nListowners vs List Moderators\n\nThose Who Would Be King, Part I\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nLurkers\n\nThose Who Would Be King, Part II\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\"Lurking Is Good. . .Remember. . .Lurking Is Good\"\n\nThose Who Would Be King, Part III\n\nThe Netiquetters\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nTPC, The Phone Company\n\nThose Who Would Be King, Part IV\n\n******\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nPlain Vanilla ASCII Versus Proprietary Markups\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nCopyright\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nLuddites\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nInternet As Chandelier\n[The Infamous Chandelier Diatribe of 1990]\n\n\n\n[chandel2/wp]\n\n\n-------------------ORIGINAL MESSAGE--------------------------\nHart undoubtedly saw academia as a series of dark brown dream\nshapes, disorganized, nightmarish, each with its set of rules\nfor nearly everything:  style of writing, footnoting, limited\nsubject matter, and each with little reference to each other.\n\n-------------------------REPLY----------------------------------\nWhat he wanted to see was knowledge in the form of a chandelier,\nwith each subject area powered by the full intensity of the flow\nof information, and each sending sparks of light to other areas,\nwhich would then incorporate and reflect them to others, a never\nending flexion and reflection, an illumination of the mind, soul\nand heart of Wo/Mankind as could not be rivalled by a diamond of\nthe brightest and purest clarity.\n\nInstead, he saw petty feudal tyrants, living in dark poorly lit,\npoorly heated, well defended castles:  living on a limited diet,\na diet of old food, stored away for long periods of time, salted\nor pickled or rotted or fermented.  Light from the outside isn't\nallowed in, for with it could come the spears and arrows of life\nand the purpose of the castle was to keep the noble life in, and\nall other forms of life out.  Thus the nobility would continue a\nprogram of inbreeding which would inevitably be outclassed by an\nentirely random reflexion of the world's gene pool.\n\nA chandelier sends light in every direction, light of all colors\nand intensities.  No matter where you stand, there are sparkles,\nsome of which are aimed at you, and you alone, some of which are\nalso seen by others:  yet, there is no spot of darkness, neither\nare there spots of overwhelming intensity, as one might expect a\nsparkling source of lights to give off.  Instead, the area is an\nevenly lit paradise, with direct and indirect light for all, and\nat least a few sparkles for everyone, some of which arrive, pass\nand stand still as we watch.\n\nBut the system is designed to eliminate sparkles, reflections or\nany but the most general lighting.  Scholars are encouraged to a\nstyle and location of writing which guarantee that 99 and 44 one\nhundredths of the people who read their work will be colleagues,\nalready a part of that inbred nobility of their fields.\n\nWe are already aware that most of our great innovations are made\nfrom leaps from field to field, that the great thinkers apply an\nitem here in this field which was gleaned from that field:  thus\nare created the leaps which create new fields which widen fields\nof human endeavor in general.\n\nYet, our petty nobles, cased away in their casements, encased in\ntheir tradition, always reject the founding of these new fields,\nfearing their own fields can only be dimmed by comparison.  This\nis true, but only by their own self-design.  If their field were\nopen to light from the outside, then the new field would be part\nof their field, but by walling up the space around themselves, a\nonce new and shining group of enterprising revolutionaries could\nonly condemn themselves to awaiting the ravages of time, tarnish\nand ignorance as they become ignorant of the outside world while\nthe outside world becomes ignorant of them.\n\nSo, I plead with you, for your sake, my sake, for everyone's, to\nopen windows in your mind, in your field, in your writing and in\nyour thinking; to let illumination both in and out, to come from\nunderneath and from behind the bastions of your defenses, and to\nembrace the light and the air, to see and to breathe, to be seen\nand to be breathed by the rest of Wo/Mankind.\n\nLet your light reflect and be reflected by the other jewels in a\ncrown of achievement more radiant than anything we have ever had\nthe chance to see or to be before.  Join the world!\n\n\n\n\n[chandel2.txt]\n\n\nA Re-Visitation to the Chandelier by Michael S. Hart\n\nEvery so often I get a note from a scholar with questions and\ncomments about the Project Gutenberg Edition of this or that.\nMost of the time this appears to be either idle speculation--\nsince there is never any further feedback about passages this\nor that edition does better in the eye of particular scholars\nor the feedback is of the \"holier than thou\" variety in which\nthe scholar claims to have found errors in our edition, which\nthe scholar then refuses to enumerate.\n\nAs for the first, there can certainly be little interest in a\nnote that appears, even after follow-up queries, of that idle\nbrand of inquiry.\n\nAs to the second, we are always glad to receive a correction,\nthat is one of the great powers of etext, that corrections be\nmade easily and quickly when compared to paper editions, with\nthe corrections being made available to those who already had\nthe previous editions, at no extra charge.\n\nHowever, when someone is an expert scholar in a field they do\nhave a certain responsibility to have their inquiries be some\nreasonable variety, with a reasonable input, in order to have\na reasonable output.  To complain that there is a problem w/o\npointing out the problem has a rich and powerful vocabulary I\ndo not feel is appropriate for this occasion.  We have put an\nentirely out-of-proportion cash reward on these errors at one\ntime or another and still have not received any indications a\nscholar has actually ever found them, which would not be more\ndifficult than finding errors in any other etexts, especially\nones not claiming an beginning accuracy of only 99.9%.\n\nHowever, if these corrections WERE forthcoming, then the 99.9\nwould soon approach 99.95, which is the reference error level\nreferred to several times in the Library of Congress Workshop\non Electronic Text Proceedings.\n\nOn the other hand, just as the Project Gutenberg's efficiency\nwould drop dramatically if we insisted our first edition of a\nbook were over 99.5% accurate, so too, should efficiency drop\ndramatically if we were ever to involve ourselves in any type\nof discussion resembling \"How many angels can dance on a pin-\nhead.\"  The fact is, that our editions are NOT targeted to an\naudience specifically interested in whether Shakespeare would\nhave said:\n\n\"To be or not to be\"\n\"To be, or not to be\"\n\"To be; or not to be\"\n\"To be:  or not to be\"\n\"To be--or not to be\"\n\nThis kind of conversation is and should be limited to the few\ndozen to few hundred scholars who are properly interested.  A\nbook designed for access by hundreds of millions cannot spend\nthat amount of time on an issue that is of minimal relevance,\nat least minimal to 99.9% of the potential readers.  However,\nwe DO intend to distribute a wide variety of Shakespeare, and\nthe contributions of such scholars would be much appreciated,\nwere it ever given, just as we have released several editions\nof the Bible, Paradise Lost and even Aesop's Fables.\n\nIn the end, when we have 30 different editions of Shakespeare\non line simulateously, this will probably not even be worthy,\nas it hardly is today, of a footnote. . .I only answer out of\nrespect for the process of creating these editions as soon as\npossible, to improve the literacy and education of the masses\nas soon as possible.\n\nFor those who would prefer to see that literacy and education\ncontinue to wallow in the mire, I can only say that a silence\non your part creates its just reward.  Your expertise dies an\nawful death when it is smothered by hiding your light under a\nbushel, as someone whom is celebrated today once said:\n\nMatthew 5:15\nNeither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on\na\ncandlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.\n\nMark 4:21\nAnd he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a\nbushel,\nor under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?\n\nLuke 8:16\nNo man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel,\nor putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that\nthey which enter in may see the light.\n\nLuke 11:33\nNo man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret\nplace,\nneither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which\ncome\nin may see the light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Rush To The Top\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nThose Who Would Be King\n\nGopher, WWW, Mosaic, Netscape\n\n\nThis chapter discusses why URLs aren't U,\nWhy Universal Resource Locators Are Not Universal\n\n\nWhen I first tried the experimental Gopher sites, I asked\nthe inventors of Gopher if their system could be oriented\nto also support FTP, should a person be more inclined for\ngoing after something one already had researched:  rather\nthan the \"browsing\" that was being done so often on those\nGopher servers.\n\nThe answer was technically \"yes,\" but realistically \"no,\"\nin that while Gophers COULD be configured such that every\nfile would be accessible by BOTH Gopher and FTP, the real\nintent of Gopher was to bypass FTP and eventually replace\nit as the primary method of surfing the Internet.\n\nI tried to explain to them that \"surfing\" the Internet is\nmuch more time consuming as well as wasteful of bandwidth\n[this at a time when all bandwidth was still free, and we\nwere only trying to make things run faster, as opposed to\nactually saving money.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nListowners vs List Moderators\n\nThose Who Would Be King, Part I\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nLurkers\n\nThose Who Would Be King, Part II\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\n\"Lurking Is Good. . .Remember. . .Lurking Is Good\"\n\nThose Who Would Be King, Part III\n\nThe Netiquetters\n\n\n\n\"We Are Surrounded By An Insurmountable Opportunity.\"\n\n\"It Is Like Drinking From A Firehose.\"\n\n\"Be Sure To Have YOUR Messages `Netiquette Approved.'\"\n\n\nThese sentiments reflect a portion of the Internet who\nhave terrified thoughts and feelings about a wonderful\nset of opportunties made available by the Internet and\nother networks.\n\nThey are afraid of too much opportunity and would like\nto make sure no one else takes advantage of such great\nopportunities because it will make themselves look and\nfeel very small by comparison.\n\nThey want to make sure YOU don't cross the boundaries,\nsimply because THEY ARE AFRAID to cross them.\n\nTheir thinking is sociological rather than logical, as\nfollows:\n\n\n1:  They are obviously afraid of so much opportunity.\n\n2:  They want to reduce the pressure of so much highly\n  available opportunity.\n\n3.  This is because they are afraid someone else would\n  make good use of this opportunity and leave them a\n  footnote in their own fields as opportunity shifts\n  into hyper-drive and nothing will ever be quite as\n  sedate, staid, prim, proper, stiff and reserved as\n  it was previous in a paper dominated room, full of\n  stuffed shirts and Robert's Rules Of Order:  which\n  THEY used to keep YOU from upsetting Apple and IBM\n  carts with more horsepower than THEY were willing,\n  and able, to use.\n\nHistory is full of examples of those in position of an\nolder variety of power using their power to deny, defy\nand otherwise stultify anything new, and therefore out\nof their own immediate forms of control.\n\nIt is also full of examples of the \"Powers-That-Be\" so\nvaingloriously squashing any potential rival powers in\nmuch the same manner as a queen bee stings other queen\nbees to death before they are even born.\n\nIn such a manner are the ideas of the new refused in a\nworld dominated by the old.\n\nOf course what comes to mind is Napoleon III's \"Salon-\ndes-Refuses\" in which works of the [now!] greatest and\nmost famous painters in the world finally had a day to\nhave their works shown to the public after years of an\nautocratic denial by the Academic Francaise's official\nSalon, originally begun in the Louvre, and where great\nexamples of these works hang today, in defiance of the\ngreatest \"powers-that-be\" that ever were, who failed--\nas all such attempts should fail.\n\n\n\"The Academie Francaise (French Academy)\nis the most renouned and oldest of the\nfive learned socities that make up the\nInsititue de France, established by\nCardinal Richelieu.\n\n[Grolier's 1994 Electronic Encyclopedia]\n\nThe encyclopedia goes on to state that\n\"`unification, and purification'\" were\namong the prime \"`development'\" goals.\n\nThe most famous recounting of Cardinal Richelieu's\nattempts to take over France and to remold it in a\nreflection of his own conservative power structure\nare detailed in Alexandre Dumas' Three Musketeers.\nPlease...take time to \"Read More About It.\"\n\nThe encyclopedia article continues on to describe the\nintense conservatism these Institutes maintain even a\nfew centuries later even though at least this \"oldest\nand most powerful\" of them, \"the Salon gradually lost\nits position as the sole official exibition of French\npainting,\" sculpture, etc., which also stood against\nthe Eiffel Tower, as well as everything else new.\n\n\nJUST SAY NO\n\nWhen they come to YOUR electronic door, enlisting YOUR\nsupport for their views of how to run the Internet you\ncan \"just say no\" and feel no obligation to make THEIR\nrules of order be YOUR rules of order:\n\n1.  Don't bother with their requests for \"conservation\n  of bandwidth\" because their idea of bandwidth is a\n  sociological \"inversion, diversion and perversion\"\n  of the term \"bandwidth.\"\n\nThey would have you believe that a dozen short message\nfiles sent through THEIR listservers are a \"bandwidth-\npreserver\" rather than one message containing what you\nhad to say all at once.\n\nA.  This is just so much sociological barnyard matter.\n  They just want to keep you from having your say in\n  an uninterrupted manner. . .it is ONLY this manner\n  in which anyone CAN BE INTERRUPTED on the Internet\n  and it requires YOU TO INTERRUPT YOURSELF, because\n  THEY CAN'T DO INTERRUPT YOU THEMSELVES:  THEY HAVE\n  TO TALK YOU INTO THE CUTTING YOUR OWN THROAT.\n\nB.  The logical rather than sociological truth is that\n  short messages are 50% made up of header materials\n  that are not part of the message you are sending--\n  but rather header and packet identifiers for these\n  messages.  Thus your series of a dozen messages of\n  the short variety is going to be 50% wasteful of a\n  bandwidth it uses, in comparison to sending the 12\n  thoughts you might want to express as one, single,\n  uninterrupted message.\n\n\n*** Insert header here\nHere is an example of the kind of header attached to a\nnormal Internet message.

Just this very week I have been\nwaiting for a power supply for one of my computers, just\nbecause the schedule of the person who has it was not in\nsync with the schedule of the person picking it up.  The\nwaste has been enormous, and trips all the way across an\nentire town are wasted, while the computer lies unused.\n\nThe same things happens with libraries and stores of all\nkinds around the world.  How many times have you tried a\nphone call, a meeting, a purchase, a repair, a return or\na variety of other things, and ended up not making these\nconnections?\n\nNo longer, with things that are available electronically\nover the Nets.  You don't have to wait until the door of\nthe library swings open to get that book you want for an\nurgent piece of research; you don't have to wait until a\nperson is available to send them an instant message; you\ndon't have to wait for the evening news on tv....\n\nThis is called Asyncronous Communication...meaning those\nschedules don't have to match exactly any more to have a\nmeaningful and quick conversation.  A minute here, there\nor wherever can be saved instead of wasted and the whole\ncommunication still travels at near instantaneous speed,\nwithout the cost of ten telegrams, ten phone calls, etc.\n\nYou can be watching television and jump up and put a few\nminutes into sending, or answering, your email and would\nnot miss anything but the commercials.\n\n\"Commercials\" bring to mind another form of asynchronous\ncommunication...taping a tv or radio show and watching a\nshow in 40 minutes instead of an hour because you do not\nhave to sit through 1 minute of \"not-show\" per 2 minutes\nof show.  No only to you not have to be home on Thursday\nnight to watch your favorite TV show any more, but those\npesky commercials can be edited out, allowing you to see\nthree shows in the time it used to take to watch two.\n\nThis kind of efficiency can have a huge effect on you or\nyour children. . .unless you WANT them to see 40 ads per\nhour on television, or spend hours copying notes from an\nassortment of library books carried miles from, and back\nto, the libraries.  Gone are the piles of 3x5 cards past\nstudents and scholars have heaped before time in efforts\nto organize mid-term papers for 9, 12, 16 or 20 years of\ninstitutionalized education.  Whole rainforests of trees\ncan be saved, not to mention the billions of hours of an\nentire population's educated scribbling that should have\nbeen spent between the ears instead of between paper and\nhand, cramping the thought and style of generations upon\ngenerations of those of us without photographic memories\nto take the place of the written word.\n\nNow we all can have photographic memories, we can quote,\nwith total accuracy, millions of 3x5 cards worth of huge\nencyclopedias of information, all without getting up for\nany reason other than eating, drinking and stretching.\n\nResearch in this area indicates that 90% of the time the\nprevious generations spent for research papers was spent\ntraipsing through the halls, stairways and bookstacks of\nlibraries; searching through 10 to 100 books for each of\nthe ones selected for further research; and searching on\n10-100 pages for each quote worthy of making it into the\nsacred piles of 3x5 cards; then searching the card piles\nfor those fit for the even more sacred sheets of paper a\nfirst draft was written on.  Even counting the fanatical\ndedication of those who go through several drafts before\na presentation draft is finally achieved the researchers\nagree that 90% of this kind of work is spent in \"hunting\nand gathering\" the information and only 10% of this time\nis spent \"digesting\" the information.\n\nIf you understand that civilization was based on the new\ninvention called \"the plow,\" which changed the habits of\n\"hunting and gathering\" peoples into civilized cities...\nthen you might be able to understand the the changes the\ncomputer and computer networks are making to those using\nthem instead of the primitive hunting and gathering jobs\nwe used to spend 90% of our time on.\n\nIn mid-19th Century the United States was over 90% in an\nagrarian economy, spending nearly all of its efforts for\nraising food to feed an empty belly.  Mid-20th Century's\nadvances reversed that ratio, so that only 10% was being\nused for the belly, 90% for civilization.\n\nThe same thing will be said for feeding the mind, if our\ncivilization ever gets around deciding that spending the\nmajority of our research time in a physical, rather than\nmental, portion of the educational process.\n\nThink of it this way, if it takes only 10% as long to do\nthe work to write a research paper, we are likely to get\neither 10 times as many research papers, or papers which\nare 10 times as good, or some combination...just like we\nended up with 10 times as much food for the body when we\nturned from hunting and gathering food to agriculture at\nthe beginnings of civilization...then we would excpect a\nsimilar transition to a civilization of the future.\n\n***\n\nIf mankind is defined as the animal who thinks; thinking\nmore and better increases the degree to which we are the\nhuman species.  Decreasing our ability to think is going\nto decrease our humanity...and yet I am living in what a\nlarge number of people define as the prime example of an\nadvanced country...where half the adult population can't\nread at a functional level.

The\nmassive variety of things kids have competing for them is\nsomething educational systems have not taken into account\nand they still rely on the threat of truant officers, not\non earning the attention of the students.\n\nThe competition is not nearly so sound asleep. . . .\n\nTV shows spend billions of their dollars figuring out how\nto get you to stay tuned in for that last few seconds and\nbillions more watching overnight ratings results to check\ntheir performances and those of their competitors.\n\nWhen TV ratings go down, the shows are changed, sometimes\nso drastically you wouldn't recognize them, and are often\ncancelled altogether, sometimes only two weeks into a new\nseason.  I once saw a show featured on one of the morning\ntalk shows to promote that evening's performance, but the\nshow was cancelled during the intervening hours.\n\nWhen school ratings go down, the ratings are changed; the\nshow remains essentially the same, and it is often a best\nteacher award winner who gets cancelled while more boring\nteachers go on year after year to bore the children of an\nassortment of former students.\n\n\n\nThe Preservation of Errors\n\nWith the advent of electronic text there is no longer any\nreason but the Seven Deadly Sins [enumerated above] for a\nperson not to share information. . .except. . .some value\nadded work to make the texts better than what passed into\ntheir hands from previous editions.\n\nHowever, with a kind of infinitely reverse logic, most of\nthe scholars dipping their toes into cyberspace, have the\nespoused idea that no Etexts should vary by one character\nfrom some exact paper predecessor, and that these Etexts,\nnew that they are, should be absolutely identified with a\nparticular paper edition which cannot be improved upon.\n\nSomehow this reminds me of the Dark Ages, that 1500 years\nduring which no weighty tome of the past could be updated\nbecause that would be the same thing as challenging those\nrevered authorities of the Golden Age of Greece, which we\nall know can never be improved upon.\n\nTheir tomes were copied, over, and over, and over again--\nwith the inevitable degradation that comes with telephone\ngames [in which you whisper a secret message through ears\nafter ears in a circle, until completely distorted babble\nreturns from the other side].  Even xeroxing has this bad\nresult if you do it over and over.\n\nTherefore scholars developed a habit of searching for any\ndifferences between editions, and referring back to older\neditions to resolve differences, because the more copying\nthe more chances for the addition of errors, comments and\nother possibly spurious information.\n\nThis was probably ok for the environment they lived in...\nbut a serious failing caused the Dark Ages which lasted a\nVERY LONG TIME by anyone's standards, and served to warn,\nin a manner we should NOT ignore, that this should not be\nthe way things should be done in the future.\n\n[The most minimized estimates of the length of the period\napproximate about 400 years from the latest possible date\nof the fall of the Roman Empire sometime in the 400's AD,\nto Charlemagne in the 800's.  Of course, most believe the\nfall of the Roman Empire was much earlier, as the empire,\nsuch as it was, was \"neither Holy, nor Roman, nor Empire\"\nfor a long time before 400 AD and things tended to return\nto the way they had been before Charlemagne after he died\nwith estimates of the end of Dark Ages ranging as late as\nthe Renaissance in the 1400's.  Thus the longest estimate\nwould be no more than 1500 years from the birth of Caesar\nuntil the Renaissance was truly underway, with a shortest\npossible estimate being somewhat under 500 years.  Thus a\nmedium estimate of 1000 years would be sure to antagonize\nboth end of the spectrum, and is therefore certainly more\naccurate than either.]\n\nIt would appear that the effort to reproduce books with a\nperfection that refuses the corrections of errors because\nof a misplaced loyalty to previous editions, looms again,\nthis time over the electronic libraries of the future, in\nthat a significant number of Etext creators are insisting\non continuing the practices, policies and precepts of the\nDark Ages in that they insist on the following:\n\n1.  Copies must be exact, no corrections can be made.\n\n2.  Any differences between copies must be decided in an\n    ethic that honors the oldest over the newest.\n\n3.  The authoritative copies must be held in sacred trust\n    in the sepulchres of the oldest institutions, and not\n    let out into the hands of the public.\n\nOf course, these are totally belied by the facts:\n\n1.  Digitial ASCII reproductions ARE exact by nature, and\n    thus no errors can creep in.\n\n2.  Any differences that DO creep in can be found in just\n    a single second with programs such as comp, diff, cf,\n    and the like.  Even a change as unnoticeable as blank\n    space added to the end of a sentence or file is found\n    and precisely located without effort.\n\n3.  Holding books in sacred trust in this manner does not\n    allow them to do their work.  A book that is not read\n    is a book that is dead.

As many of you know, the\nProject Gutenberg Etexts are 90% from the Public Domain with 10%\nreproduced by permission.  However, there is a movement to cease\nthe introduction of materials into the Public Domain in Congress\n[of the United States] which would effectively stop the entry of\nthis kind of information into general Internet circulation.  200\nyears ago the US copyright was established at 14 years according\nto the speeches of Senator Orrin Hatch, sponsoring one bill, and\nthen extended another 14, then another 28, then extended to life\nof the author plus another 50 years after, and 75 years for that\nkind of copyright which is created by a corporation.\n\nThis means that if you took your 5 year old kid to see \"The Lion\nKing\" when it came out, the kid would have to be 80 years old to\nhave lived long enough to have a copy that was not licensed by a\ncommercial venture.  The fact that the average person will never\nreach the age of 80 effectively creates a permanent copyright to\ndeny public access during the expected lifetimes of any of us.\n\nHowever, this is not enough. . .the new bill is designed to kill\noff ANY chance that even 1% of the youngest of us will ever have\nour own rights to an unlicensed copy of any material produced in\nour lifetimes because if these bills are passed, our young kid a\nparagraph above will have to reach the age of 100 to have rights\nto the materials published today, while the rights of inventors,\nprotected by patent law, will still expire in 17 years.\n\nWhy is it more important that we all can buy Public Domain legal\ncopies of the latest supersonic toaster less than two decades of\nproduction after the original, but it is not as important for us\nto be well read, well informed and well educated?\n\n\n***\n\nFREE WINNIE-THE-POOH\n\nWe hope with your assistance we can mount a successful effort to\nfree Winnie-the Pooh, imprisoned by various copyright laws since\nhis birth in 1926.\n\nAt the beginning of Project Gutenberg, one of our first projects\nwas going to be the children's classic Winnie-the-Pooh:  written\nin 1926, and therefore up for copyright renewal in 1954, and the\ncopyright renewal would have then expired in 1982, and thus been\na perfect candidate for Project Gutenberg's Children's Library.\n\nHowever, this was not allowed to happen.\n\nInstead, the copyright on Winnie-the-Pooh was extended, for a 75\nyear total, meaning we would have to wait until 2001 for the new\ncopyright term to expire, effectively keeping Winnie-the-Pooh in\njail for another two decades or so.\n\nHowever, two new bills have been introduced into the Senate, and\nthe House of Representatives of the United States to extend this\nterm of imprisonment yet again, for an additional 20 years.\n\nThe last copyright extension in the United States was in 1975 as\nI recall.  If we extend the copyright 20 years every 20 years we\nwill destroy the very concept of Public Domain, as we have known\nit since the beginning of copyright.\n\nCopyright only began when people other than those extremely rich\nfew who could afford a price of a family farm for every book had\ntheir places as the only owners of books destroyed by Gutenberg,\nthe inventor of the moveable type printing press.\n\nMass availability of books was just something that should not be\ntolerated. . .therefore the printers' guilds lobbied for a right\nto decide not only who could print any book but whether the book\nwould be printed at all.  This was a very strong monopoly put on\nan industry that had been a free-for-all since Gutenberg.\n\nThis copyright remained virtually the same length, 28 years, for\nquite a while, and the first United States copyright was for two\n14 year periods, the second automatically given on request.\n\nWhen books once again became too popular at the turn of the last\ncentury, and many publishers began selling inexpensive sets of a\nvariety of extensive subjects, the copyrights were doubled again\nso that the 14 years plus 14 year extension became 28 years with\na 28 year extension, which was done around 1909.\n\nThen, in the last half of this century, books once again were to\nbecome too widely spread, this time with the advent of the xerox\nmachine.  Not only were new laws made to curb copying, but those\nold laws were extended from that 28+28=56 years to 75 years, and\nthis was done in 1975 or so.\n\nNow with the advent of truly UNLIMITED DISTRIBUTION available to\nthe world via computer files, books are once again getting to be\ntoo widely spread, and further restriction is in the works, this\ntime only 20 years after the last extension, which was for about\n20 years.  Work is already underway for a permanent copyright to\nkeep us from putting \"the Library of Congress\" on our disks.\n\nI have said for years that by the time computers get as far into\nthe future as they have come from the past, that we will be able\nto hold all of the Library of Congress in one hand, but I added,\n\"They probably won't let us do it.\"\n\nLet me explain that for a minute; back in 1979 Project Gutenberg\nbought its first hard drive for about $1500 dollars, for Apple's\nnew Personal Computer.  Not counting inflation we can buy drives\nthat will hold 1,000 times as much data for the same price.  The\ntrue cost, counting inflation, would be that our $1500 would buy\ncloser to 10,000 times as much space because our $1500 from 1979\nis equivalent to about $5,000 today, if we get the new \"magneto-\nresistive\" drive from IBM.  This is NOT counting ZIP compression\nor other compression programs.  If you count them, you would get\nabout 5,000 times as much data for your money today as in 1979.\n\n 5 million bytes = $1500 in 1979 = one copy of Shakespeare\n12 billion bytes = $4500 in 1995 [inflation has tripled plus]\n25 billion bytes . . .with compression programs.\n\nThis is 5,000 copies of the Complete Shakespeare on one disk, or\nless then $1 per copy.  This upsets those who think there should\nnot be unlimited numbers of books in the world, so definition of\ncopyright and consequently the definition of public domain is in\ndanger of being changed, as they have been every time in history\nthat the public got too much information.\n\nIf the trend listed above continues for only 15 more years, 2010\nwill see drives containing 25 million copies of Shakespeare, for\nthe same price as the drive that could only hold one copy thirty\nyears earlier, and the price per copy will be so low that it may\ntake more money to run the calculation to figure the prices than\nthe prices actually are.\n\nThis is the real reason copyright gets extended, history repeats\nitself, over and over again, and \"those who do not study history\nare condemned to repeat it.\"  What they want is to ensure you do\nnot study history, so they can do the same things over and over,\nbecause that is the easiest way for them to make money.  Change,\nespecially the kinds that are happening in the computers' world,\nis what scares them.  When changes comes along, they try as hard\nas they can to keep things the way they were, and nowhere is it\nmore obvious than now.  Most copyrighted materials are gone, out\nof print forever, in only five years, maybe 75% in ten years, in\n15 years probably 87% are out of print, 20 years at that rate is\n93%, 25 years is 96%, 30 years is 98% and 35 years would be well\nover 99%. . .and that doesn't even take into account the shorter\nterm runs of newspapers, magazines, TV show, movies, records and\nall those things that most people don't even expect to last more\nthan year in the public eye.  The fact is that probably only .1%\nor less of anything published in the 1920s is still in print for\nthe original edition. . .that is only one item out of 1,000, and\nthat estimate is probably quite high.  The point is that can our\ncopyright laws support the withholding of 1,000 books for 1 that\nis actually available. . .we don't make our driving laws for the\n1 out of 1,000 that could be race car drivers, that would be one\nof the silliest laws on record.  We have to make our laws so the\nlaw applies well to everyone, not just to make the rich richer--\nor in this case the Information Rich richer.\n\nMuch of this new effort not to let anything out of copyright was\nmade by the music industry, which just had the best year of all,\never, shipping over a billion CD's, tapes, records and videos.\n\nWhy, with all this success, they want to keep copyrights on 1920\nitems that are 99% out of print. . .is a question worth asking--\nthe answer is the copyright has always been extended when books,\nor other forms of information, have become too plentiful; we SAY\nwe want everyone to be well read and well informed, and then the\nlaw makes it more difficult.  Just look as what has happened for\nliteracy in the United States during the period that a copyright\nlaw demanded that nothing become Public Domain coming up to 1975\n. . .is keeping Hemingway or Winnie-the-Pooh from becoming parts\nof the Public Domain going to improve the US literacy rate?\n\nWe hope with your assistance we can mount a successful effort to\nfree Winnie-the Pooh, imprisoned by various copyright laws since\nhis birth in 1926. . .all copyright laws referred to were United\nStates copyright laws in effect at various times Winnie-the-Pooh\nhas been incarcerated.  Other countries have different copyright\nlaws, and Winnie-the-Pooh was written in England, so a variation\nin the US laws cannot be said to have affects other copyrights.\n\nHowever, the above example is pretty valid for any book that was\npublished in the US during the 1920s or 1930's.\n\n***\n\nLadies and Gentlemen. . .Start Your Engines!\n\n\nThe Race to the Information Age Has Begun.\n\nIt began in a much more quiet manner than the Golden Spike\nwhich joined the two halves of a Transcontinental Railroad\nexactly 100 years earlier. . .so much more quietly that we\nnever knew it was happening, and we were all left standing\nthere at the starting gate, gawking at Men on the Moon.\n\nIt all happened about 25 years ago, in 1969, but the media\nnever put the word \"Internet\" on the front page of a major\nnewspaper until the Wall Street Journal did it, on October\n29, 1991. . .yet even so, most of you probably never heard\nor saw the word Internet in the media until 1994, with the\n25th Anniversay hardly ever mentioned, as the idea was for\neveryone to think the Internet is the newest thing around,\nand to get us all to buy tickets for $20-$25 a month.\n\nWhat is the \"First Rule of Reporting a Story?\". . .oh yes:\n\n\nFollow The Money\n\nRight now there are 40-50 million people on the Internet--\nand if someone could figure out how to make them all pay a\n$20-$25 fee. . .that would be $100 million a month or over\na billion dollars a year.\n\nWow. . .if they can do that to an Information Superhighway\nthat had been running free of charge since the 60's, might\nbe they will figure out how to do it with those Interstate\nSuperhighways made of concrete, too, most of them have not\nbeen running any longer than that.\n\nThe NSFNet [National Science Foundation Network] was being\ncussed and discussed by the powers that be in the hopes it\ncould be dismantled at the same time most of us were first\nhearing about the Internet, and none of us would notice it\nwhen we were all asked to pay that billion dollars a year,\nfor something that had been as free as the highway systems\nto the Information Rich/Etite for all those years.\n\n\nLet's Follow The Money Some More\n\nThe first hard drives anyone used on the Internet were not\nvery big in terms of how much information they would hold,\nbut they were HUGE compared to any other hard drives every\ncomputer has used for over 15 years. . .they were the size\nof washing machines, and could not hold information as big\nas the Bible or Shakespeare.\n\nToday, for 1% of the price you can get 1,000 times as much\nstorage space. . .2,000 times as much, if you use a modern\ncompression program when storing your information.\n\nThe point I am trying to make here is that the price of an\nelectronic storage device has fallen literally closer to 0\nthan to 1% of the price it was when the Internet started--\nand this is scheduled to continue for the next few decades,\nwhich means we will all be able to affort drives that will\nbe able to hold the entire Library of Congress. . . .if it\nis allowed.\n\nBut it won't be.\n\nThere's the rub.\n\nThe point I am trying to make is that just because we will\nfinally have the box capable of storing the entire Library\nof Congress. . .they will make sure we don't get to, ever,\nfor we will be dead by the time anything we see today gets\nold enough for the copyright to expire.\n\n\nLet's Follow The Money Some More\n\nJust a few months ago, the music industry completed record\nsales figures for any year in history, moving 1 billion of\na combination of CDs, tapes, records and music videos, for\na staggering $12 billion dollars.\n\nThe response to this success, a few weeks ago, was for the\nmusic industry to propose, not a rebate to their customers\nbut just the opposite, an additional 20 years during which\nthe music industry could have a continued monopoly on that\nmusic, and. . .purely incidentally. . .this monopoly would\nalso be extended to books, television, movies, video games\nand everything else that could be copyrighted.\n\nI think the only way to understand this is to put it in an\nelementary perspective such as this:\n\nRight now, you take your kid to see a movie, any movie the\nproducers are releasing right now.  Let's say your kid has\nbeen alive 5 years, under current law, that kid has to get\nto 80 years old before s/he can own a copy of that movie--\nwithout the permission of the copyright holder. . .and the\naverage age such kids can be expected to live is less than\n80 years. . .thus making the copyright permanent for us or\nthe kids we take to the movies.\n\nThe same is true for all current copyrighted materials and\nthe music industry is trying to add another 20 years to an\nalready \"life sentence\". . .and this when their sales have\njust broken all records in history, if you will pardon the\npun. . . .\n\nSince the founding of the United States when copyrights or\npatents were proposed by Thomas Jefferson for 17 years the\nperiod was lengthened to 28 years, plus another 28 years--\nand most recently to 75 years for corporate copyrights and\n\"life plus 50 years\" for individual copyrights.\n\nThat means that \"Zen and the Art of the Internet,\" written\nby a 20 year old, who will be expected to live for another\n55 years or so, will still be under copyright sentencing a\ncentury from now, and will be totally out of date and will\nbe totally useless other than as a historical footnote.\n\nIf this is the response of an industry that has just had a\nhuge record bashing year of sales, a response not to lower\nprices but to raise them, then we are doing something in a\nbackwards manner in the case of copyright.\n\nWhen car makers have really good years, or really bad ones\nfor that matter, they work very hard to attract customers,\nwith new innovations, more car for the money, financing on\nbetter terms, or whatever, and when they have record years\nthey give their workers huge bonuses, which I am sure most\nof you have heard about recently, and they also compete in\nan aggressive manner to keep sales up.\n\nCopyright and patents are what allow people NOT to compete\nin the marketplace, as least for the first decade or two a\nnew item is in the marketplace. . .only now copyrights are\nbeing extended to include the entire lifetime, not only of\nthe copyright holder, but of the audience as well.\n\nSomething is wrong.\n\n\nThe Information Age Is Being Ruled By The Information Rich\nAs Surely as the Transcontinental Railroads Were Ruled For\nDecades By The Robber Barons.\n\nThe Information Rich had a free ride on the Superhighways,\nabout 25 years worth of free ride, and now the Information\nPoor want a ride so the Information Rich are shutting down\nthe free rides and are selling tickets. . .selling tickets\nto something which until this year was so inexpensive that\nit it hardly paid to figure out what to charge any person,\nmuch less any institution.",
