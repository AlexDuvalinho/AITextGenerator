There were stories that it had once been more\nattractive, but that had been so long ago that no one remembered the\ntime. It stood back in its gloomy, narrow strips of uncared-for, smoky\ngardens, whose broken iron railings were supposed to protect it from the\nsurging traffic of a road which was always roaring with the rattle of\nbusses, cabs, drays, and vans, and the passing of people who were\nshabbily dressed and looked as if they were either going to hard work or\ncoming from it, or hurrying to see if they could find some of it to do\nto keep themselves from going hungry. The brick fronts of the houses\nwere blackened with smoke, their windows were nearly all dirty and hung\nwith dingy curtains, or had no curtains at all; the strips of ground,\nwhich had once been intended to grow flowers in, had been trodden down\ninto bare earth in which even weeds had forgotten to grow. One of them\nwas used as a stone-cutter's yard, and cheap monuments, crosses, and\nslates were set out for sale, bearing inscriptions beginning with\n\"Sacred to the Memory of.\" Another had piles of old lumber in it,\nanother exhibited second-hand furniture, chairs with unsteady legs,\nsofas with horsehair stuffing bulging out of holes in their covering,\nmirrors with blotches or cracks in them. The insides of the houses were\nas gloomy as the outside. They were all exactly alike. In each a dark\nentrance passage led to narrow stairs going up to bedrooms, and to\nnarrow steps going down to a basement kitchen. The back bedroom looked\nout on small, sooty, flagged yards, where thin cats quarreled, or sat on\nthe coping of the brick walls hoping that sometime they might feel the\nsun; the front rooms looked over the noisy road, and through their\nwindows came the roar and rattle of it. It was shabby and cheerless on\nthe brightest days, and on foggy or rainy ones it was the most forlorn\nplace in London.\n\nAt least that was what one boy thought as he stood near the iron\nrailings watching the passers-by on the morning on which this story\nbegins, which was also the morning after he had been brought by his\nfather to live as a lodger in the back sitting-room of the house No. 7.\n\nHe was a boy about twelve years old, his name was Marco Loristan, and he\nwas the kind of boy people look at a second time when they have looked\nat him once. In the first place, he was a very big boy--tall for his\nyears, and with a particularly strong frame. His shoulders were broad\nand his arms and legs were long and powerful. He was quite used to\nhearing people say, as they glanced at him, \"What a fine, big lad!\" And\nthen they always looked again at his face. It was not an English face\nor an American one, and was very dark in coloring. His features were\nstrong, his black hair grew on his head like a mat, his eyes were large\nand deep set, and looked out between thick, straight, black lashes. He\nwas as un-English a boy as one could imagine, and an observing person\nwould have been struck at once by a sort of _silent_ look expressed by\nhis whole face, a look which suggested that he was not a boy who talked\nmuch.\n\nThis look was specially noticeable this morning as he stood before the\niron railings. The things he was thinking of were of a kind likely to\nbring to the face of a twelve-year-old boy an unboyish expression.\n\nHe was thinking of the long, hurried journey he and his father and their\nold soldier servant, Lazarus, had made during the last few days--the\njourney from Russia. Cramped in a close third-class railway carriage,\nthey had dashed across the Continent as if something important or\nterrible were driving them, and here they were, settled in London as\nif they were going to live forever at No. 7 Philibert Place. He knew,\nhowever, that though they might stay a year, it was just as probable\nthat, in the middle of some night, his father or Lazarus might waken him\nfrom his sleep and say, \"Get up--dress yourself quickly. We must go at\nonce.\" A few days later, he might be in St. Petersburg, Berlin, Vienna,\nor Budapest, huddled away in some poor little house as shabby and\ncomfortless as No. 7 Philibert Place.\n\nHe passed his hand over his forehead as he thought of it and watched the\nbusses. His strange life and his close association with his father had\nmade him much older than his years, but he was only a boy, after all,\nand the mystery of things sometimes weighed heavily upon him, and set\nhim to deep wondering.\n\nIn not one of the many countries he knew had he ever met a boy whose\nlife was in the least like his own. Other boys had homes in which they\nspent year after year; they went to school regularly, and played with\nother boys, and talked openly of the things which happened to them, and\nthe journeys they made. When he remained in a place long enough to make\na few boy-friends, he knew he must never forget that his whole existence\nwas a sort of secret whose safety depended upon his own silence and\ndiscretion.\n\nThis was because of the promises he had made to his father, and they\nhad been the first thing he remembered. Not that he had ever regretted\nanything connected with his father. He threw his black head up as he\nthought of that. None of the other boys had such a father, not one of\nthem. His father was his idol and his chief. He had scarcely ever seen\nhim when his clothes had not been poor and shabby, but he had also never\nseen him when, despite his worn coat and frayed linen, he had not stood\nout among all others as more distinguished than the most noticeable of\nthem. When he walked down a street, people turned to look at him even\noftener than they turned to look at Marco, and the boy felt as if it was\nnot merely because he was a big man with a handsome, dark face, but\nbecause he looked, somehow, as if he had been born to command armies,\nand as if no one would think of disobeying him. Yet Marco had never\nseen him command any one, and they had always been poor, and shabbily\ndressed, and often enough ill-fed. But whether they were in one country\nor another, and whatsoever dark place they seemed to be hiding in, the\nfew people they saw treated him with a sort of deference, and nearly\nalways stood when they were in his presence, unless he bade them sit\ndown.\n\n\"It is because they know he is a patriot, and patriots are respected,\"\nthe boy had told himself.\n\nHe himself wished to be a patriot, though he had never seen his own\ncountry of Samavia. He knew it well, however. His father had talked to\nhim about it ever since that day when he had made the promises. He had\ntaught him to know it by helping him to study curious detailed maps of\nit--maps of its cities, maps of its mountains, maps of its roads. He had\ntold him stories of the wrongs done its people, of their sufferings and\nstruggles for liberty, and, above all, of their unconquerable courage.\nWhen they talked together of its history, Marco's boy-blood burned and\nleaped in his veins, and he always knew, by the look in his father's\neyes, that his blood burned also. His countrymen had been killed, they\nhad been robbed, they had died by thousands of cruelties and starvation,\nbut their souls had never been conquered, and, through all the years\nduring which more powerful nations crushed and enslaved them, they never\nceased to struggle to free themselves and stand unfettered as Samavians\nhad stood centuries before.\n\n\"Why do we not live there,\" Marco had cried on the day the promises were\nmade. \"Why do we not go back and fight? When I am a man, I will be a\nsoldier and die for Samavia.\"\n\n\"We are of those who must _live_ for Samavia--working day and night,\" his\nfather had answered; \"denying ourselves, training our bodies and souls,\nusing our brains, learning the things which are best to be done for our\npeople and our country. Even exiles may be Samavian soldiers--I am one,\nyou must be one.\"\n\n\"Are we exiles?\" asked Marco.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the answer. \"But even if we never set foot on Samavian soil,\nwe must give our lives to it. I have given mine since I was sixteen.\nI shall give it until I die.\"\n\n\"Have you never lived there?\" said Marco.\n\nA strange look shot across his father's face.\n\n\"No,\" he answered, and said no more. Marco watching him, knew he must\nnot ask the question again.\n\nThe next words his father said were about the promises. Marco was quite\na little fellow at the time, but he understood the solemnity of them,\nand felt that he was being honored as if he were a man.\n\n\"When you are a man, you shall know all you wish to know,\" Loristan\nsaid. \"Now you are a child, and your mind must not be burdened. But\nyou must do your part. A child sometimes forgets that words may be\ndangerous. You must promise never to forget this. Wheresoever you are;\nif you have playmates, you must remember to be silent about many things.\nYou must not speak of what I do, or of the people who come to see me.\nYou must not mention the things in your life which make it different\nfrom the lives of other boys. You must keep in your mind that a secret\nexists which a chance foolish word might betray. You are a Samavian, and\nthere have been Samavians who have died a thousand deaths rather than\nbetray a secret. You must learn to obey without question, as if you were\na soldier. Now you must take your oath of allegiance.\"\n\nHe rose from his seat and went to a corner of the room. He knelt down,\nturned back the carpet, lifted a plank, and took something from beneath\nit. It was a sword, and, as he came back to Marco, he drew it out from\nits sheath. The child's strong, little body stiffened and drew itself\nup, his large, deep eyes flashed. He was to take his oath of allegiance\nupon a sword as if he were a man. He did not know that his small hand\nopened and shut with a fierce understanding grip because those of his\nblood had for long centuries past carried swords and fought with them.\n\nLoristan gave him the big bared weapon, and stood erect before him.\n\n\"Repeat these words after me sentence by sentence!\" he commanded.\n\nAnd as he spoke them Marco echoed each one loudly and clearly.\n\n\"The sword in my hand--for Samavia!\n\n\"The heart in my breast--for Samavia!\n\n\"The swiftness of my sight, the thought of my brain, the life of my\nlife--for Samavia.\n\n\"Here grows a man for Samavia.\n\n\"God be thanked!\"\n\nThen Loristan put his hand on the child's shoulder, and his dark face\nlooked almost fiercely proud.\n\n\"From this hour,\" he said, \"you and I are comrades at arms.\"\n\nAnd from that day to the one on which he stood beside the broken iron\nrailings of No. 7 Philibert Place, Marco had not forgotten for one hour.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nA YOUNG CITIZEN OF THE WORLD\n\n\nHe had been in London more than once before, but not to the lodgings in\nPhilibert Place. When he was brought a second or third time to a town\nor city, he always knew that the house he was taken to would be in a\nquarter new to him, and he should not see again the people he had seen\nbefore. Such slight links of acquaintance as sometimes formed themselves\nbetween him and other children as shabby and poor as himself were easily\nbroken. His father, however, had never forbidden him to make chance\nacquaintances. He had, in fact, told him that he had reasons for not\nwishing him to hold himself aloof from other boys. The only barrier\nwhich must exist between them must be the barrier of silence concerning\nhis wanderings from country to country. Other boys as poor as he was did\nnot make constant journeys, therefore they would miss nothing from his\nboyish talk when he omitted all mention of his. When he was in Russia,\nhe must speak only of Russian places and Russian people and customs.\nWhen he was in France, Germany, Austria, or England, he must do the same\nthing. When he had learned English, French, German, Italian, and Russian\nhe did not know. He had seemed to grow up in the midst of changing\ntongues which all seemed familiar to him, as languages are familiar to\nchildren who have lived with them until one scarcely seems less familiar\nthan another. He did remember, however, that his father had always been\nunswerving in his attention to his pronunciation and method of speaking\nthe language of any country they chanced to be living in.\n\n\"You must not seem a foreigner in any country,\" he had said to him. \"It\nis necessary that you should not. But when you are in England, you must\nnot know French, or German, or anything but English.\"\n\nOnce, when he was seven or eight years old, a boy had asked him what his\nfather's work was.\n\n\"His own father is a carpenter, and he asked me if my father was one,\"\nMarco brought the story to Loristan. \"I said you were not. Then he asked\nif you were a shoemaker, and another one said you might be a bricklayer\nor a tailor--and I didn't know what to tell them.\" He had been out\nplaying in a London street, and he put a grubby little hand on his\nfather's arm, and clutched and almost fiercely shook it. \"I wanted to\nsay that you were not like their fathers, not at all. I knew you were\nnot, though you were quite as poor. You are not a bricklayer or a\nshoemaker, but a patriot--you could not be only a bricklayer--you!\" He\nsaid it grandly and with a queer indignation, his black head held up and\nhis eyes angry.\n\nLoristan laid his hand against his mouth.\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" he said. \"Is it an insult to a man to think he may be a\ncarpenter or make a good suit of clothes? If I could make our clothes,\nwe should go better dressed. If I were a shoemaker, your toes would not\nbe making their way into the world as they are now.\" He was smiling, but\nMarco saw his head held itself high, too, and his eyes were glowing as\nhe touched his shoulder. \"I know you did not tell them I was a patriot,\"\nhe ended. \"What was it you said to them?\"\n\n\"I remembered that you were nearly always writing and drawing maps, and\nI said you were a writer, but I did not know what you wrote--and that\nyou said it was a poor trade. I heard you say that once to Lazarus. Was\nthat a right thing to tell them?\"\n\n\"Yes. You may always say it if you are asked. There are poor fellows\nenough who write a thousand different things which bring them little\nmoney. There is nothing strange in my being a writer.\"\n\nSo Loristan answered him, and from that time if, by any chance, his\nfather's means of livelihood were inquired into, it was simple enough\nand true enough to say that he wrote to earn his bread.\n\nIn the first days of strangeness to a new place, Marco often walked a\ngreat deal. He was strong and untiring, and it amused him to wander\nthrough unknown streets, and look at shops, and houses, and people.\nHe did not confine himself to the great thoroughfares, but liked to\nbranch off into the side streets and odd, deserted-looking squares, and\neven courts and alleyways. He often stopped to watch workmen and talk to\nthem if they were friendly. In this way he made stray acquaintances in\nhis strollings, and learned a good many things. He had a fondness for\nwandering musicians, and, from an old Italian who had in his youth been\na singer in opera, he had learned to sing a number of songs in his\nstrong, musical boy-voice. He knew well many of the songs of the people\nin several countries.\n\nIt was very dull this first morning, and he wished that he had something\nto do or some one to speak to. To do nothing whatever is a depressing\nthing at all times, but perhaps it is more especially so when one is a\nbig, healthy boy twelve years old. London as he saw it in the Marylebone\nRoad seemed to him a hideous place. It was murky and shabby-looking, and\nfull of dreary-faced people. It was not the first time he had seen the\nsame things, and they always made him feel that he wished he had\nsomething to do.\n\nSuddenly he turned away from the gate and went into the house to speak\nto Lazarus. He found him in his dingy closet of a room on the fourth\nfloor at the back of the house.\n\n\"I am going for a walk,\" he announced to him. \"Please tell my father if\nhe asks for me. He is busy, and I must not disturb him.\"\n\nLazarus was patching an old coat as he often patched things--even shoes\nsometimes. When Marco spoke, he stood up at once to answer him. He was\nvery obstinate and particular about certain forms of manner. Nothing\nwould have obliged him to remain seated when Loristan or Marco was near\nhim. Marco thought it was because he had been so strictly trained as a\nsoldier. He knew that his father had had great trouble to make him lay\naside his habit of saluting when they spoke to him.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" Marco had heard Loristan say to him almost severely,\nonce when he had forgotten himself and had stood at salute while\nhis master passed through a broken-down iron gate before an equally\nbroken-down-looking lodging-house--\"perhaps you can force yourself to\nremember when I tell you that it is not safe--_it is not safe_! You put\nus in danger!\"\n\nIt was evident that this helped the good fellow to control himself.\nMarco remembered that at the time he had actually turned pale, and had\nstruck his forehead and poured forth a torrent of Samavian dialect in\npenitence and terror. But, though he no longer saluted them in public,\nhe omitted no other form of reverence and ceremony, and the boy had\nbecome accustomed to being treated as if he were anything but the shabby\nlad whose very coat was patched by the old soldier who stood \"at\nattention\" before him.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Lazarus answered. \"Where was it your wish to go?\"\n\nMarco knitted his black brows a little in trying to recall distinct\nmemories of the last time he had been in London.\n\n\"I have been to so many places, and have seen so many things since I was\nhere before, that I must begin to learn again about the streets and\nbuildings I do not quite remember.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Lazarus. \"There _have_ been so many. I also forget. You\nwere but eight years old when you were last here.\"\n\n\"I think I will go and find the royal palace, and then I will walk about\nand learn the names of the streets,\" Marco said.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Lazarus, and this time he made his military salute.\n\nMarco lifted his right hand in recognition, as if he had been a young\nofficer. Most boys might have looked awkward or theatrical in making\nthe gesture, but he made it with naturalness and ease, because he had\nbeen familiar with the form since his babyhood. He had seen officers\nreturning the salutes of their men when they encountered each other by\nchance in the streets, he had seen princes passing sentries on their\nway to their carriages, more august personages raising the quiet,\nrecognizing hand to their helmets as they rode through applauding\ncrowds. He had seen many royal persons and many royal pageants, but\nalways only as an ill-clad boy standing on the edge of the crowd of\ncommon people. An energetic lad, however poor, cannot spend his days in\ngoing from one country to another without, by mere every-day chance,\nbecoming familiar with the outer life of royalties and courts. Marco had\nstood in continental thoroughfares when visiting emperors rode by with\nglittering soldiery before and behind them, and a populace shouting\ncourteous welcomes. He knew where in various great capitals the sentries\nstood before kingly or princely palaces. He had seen certain royal faces\noften enough to know them well, and to be ready to make his salute when\nparticular quiet and unattended carriages passed him by.\n\n\"It is well to know them. It is well to observe everything and to train\none's self to remember faces and circumstances,\" his father had said.\n\"If you were a young prince or a young man training for a diplomatic\ncareer, you would be taught to notice and remember people and things\nas you would be taught to speak your own language with elegance. Such\nobservation would be your most practical accomplishment and greatest\npower. It is as practical for one man as another--for a poor lad in a\npatched coat as for one whose place is to be in courts. As you cannot be\neducated in the ordinary way, you must learn from travel and the world.\nYou must lose nothing--forget nothing.\"\n\nIt was his father who had taught him everything, and he had learned a\ngreat deal. Loristan had the power of making all things interesting to\nfascination. To Marco it seemed that he knew everything in the world.\nThey were not rich enough to buy many books, but Loristan knew the\ntreasures of all great cities, the resources of the smallest towns.\nTogether he and his boy walked through the endless galleries filled with\nthe wonders of the world, the pictures before which through centuries an\nunbroken procession of almost worshiping eyes had passed uplifted.\nBecause his father made the pictures seem the glowing, burning work of\nstill-living men whom the centuries could not turn to dust, because he\ncould tell the stories of their living and laboring to triumph, stories\nof what they felt and suffered and were, the boy became as familiar with\nthe old masters--Italian, German, French, Dutch, English, Spanish--as he\nwas with most of the countries they had lived in. They were not merely\nold masters to him, but men who were great, men who seemed to him to\nhave wielded beautiful swords and held high, splendid lights. His father\ncould not go often with him, but he always took him for the first time\nto the galleries, museums, libraries, and historical places which were\nrichest in treasures of art, beauty, or story. Then, having seen them\nonce through his eyes, Marco went again and again alone, and so grew\nintimate with the wonders of the world. He knew that he was gratifying\na wish of his father's when he tried to train himself to observe\nall things and forget nothing. These palaces of marvels were his\nschool-rooms, and his strange but rich education was the most\ninteresting part of his life. In time, he knew exactly the places where\nthe great Rembrandts, Vandykes, Rubens, Raphaels, Tintorettos, or Frans\nHals hung; he knew whether this masterpiece or that was in Vienna, in\nParis, in Venice, or Munich, or Rome. He knew stories of splendid crown\njewels, of old armor, of ancient crafts, and of Roman relics dug up from\nbeneath the foundations of old German cities. Any boy wandering to amuse\nhimself through museums and palaces on \"free days\" could see what he\nsaw, but boys living fuller and less lonely lives would have been less\nlikely to concentrate their entire minds on what they looked at, and\nalso less likely to store away facts with the determination to be able\nto recall at any moment the mental shelf on which they were laid. Having\nno playmates and nothing to play with, he began when he was a very\nlittle fellow to make a sort of game out of his rambles through\npicture-galleries, and the places which, whether they called themselves\nmuseums or not, were storehouses or relics of antiquity. There were\nalways the blessed \"free days,\" when he could climb any marble steps,\nand enter any great portal without paying an entrance fee. Once inside,\nthere were plenty of plainly and poorly dressed people to be seen, but\nthere were not often boys as young as himself who were not attended by\nolder companions. Quiet and orderly as he was, he often found himself\nstared at. The game he had created for himself was as simple as it was\nabsorbing. It was to try how much he could remember and clearly describe\nto his father when they sat together at night and talked of what he had\nseen. These night talks filled his happiest hours. He never felt lonely\nthen, and when his father sat and watched him with a certain curious\nand deep attention in his dark, reflective eyes, the boy was utterly\ncomforted and content. Sometimes he brought back rough and crude\nsketches of objects he wished to ask questions about, and Loristan could\nalways relate to him the full, rich story of the thing he wanted to\nknow. They were stories made so splendid and full of color in the\ntelling that Marco could not forget them.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nTHE LEGEND OF THE LOST PRINCE\n\n\nAs he walked through the streets, he was thinking of one of these\nstories. It was one he had heard first when he was very young, and it\nhad so seized upon his imagination that he had asked often for it.\nIt was, indeed, a part of the long-past history of Samavia, and he had\nloved it for that reason. Lazarus had often told it to him, sometimes\nadding much detail, but he had always liked best his father's version,\nwhich seemed a thrilling and living thing. On their journey from Russia,\nduring an hour when they had been forced to wait in a cold wayside\nstation and had found the time long, Loristan had discussed it with him.\nHe always found some such way of making hard and comfortless hours\neasier to live through.\n\n\"Fine, big lad--for a foreigner,\" Marco heard a man say to his companion\nas he passed them this morning. \"Looks like a Pole or a Russian.\"\n\nIt was this which had led his thoughts back to the story of the Lost\nPrince. He knew that most of the people who looked at him and called him\na \"foreigner\" had not even heard of Samavia. Those who chanced to recall\nits existence knew of it only as a small fierce country, so placed upon\nthe map that the larger countries which were its neighbors felt they\nmust control and keep it in order, and therefore made incursions into\nit, and fought its people and each other for possession. But it had not\nbeen always so. It was an old, old country, and hundreds of years ago it\nhad been as celebrated for its peaceful happiness and wealth as for its\nbeauty. It was often said that it was one of the most beautiful places\nin the world. A favorite Samavian legend was that it had been the site\nof the Garden of Eden. In those past centuries, its people had been of\nsuch great stature, physical beauty, and strength, that they had been\nlike a race of noble giants. They were in those days a pastoral people,\nwhose rich crops and splendid flocks and herds were the envy of less\nfertile countries. Among the shepherds and herdsmen there were poets who\nsang their own songs when they piped among their sheep upon the mountain\nsides and in the flower-thick valleys. Their songs had been about\npatriotism and bravery, and faithfulness to their chieftains and their\ncountry. The simple courtesy of the poorest peasant was as stately as\nthe manner of a noble. But that, as Loristan had said with a tired\nsmile, had been before they had had time to outlive and forget the\nGarden of Eden. Five hundred years ago, there had succeeded to the\nthrone a king who was bad and weak. His father had lived to be ninety\nyears old, and his son had grown tired of waiting in Samavia for his\ncrown. He had gone out into the world, and visited other countries and\ntheir courts. When he returned and became king, he lived as no Samavian\nking had lived before. He was an extravagant, vicious man of furious\ntemper and bitter jealousies. He was jealous of the larger courts and\ncountries he had seen, and tried to introduce their customs and their\nambitions. He ended by introducing their worst faults and vices. There\narose political quarrels and savage new factions. Money was squandered\nuntil poverty began for the first time to stare the country in the face.\nThe big Samavians, after their first stupefaction, broke forth into\nfurious rage. There were mobs and riots, then bloody battles. Since it\nwas the king who had worked this wrong, they would have none of him.\nThey would depose him and make his son king in his place. It was at\nthis part of the story that Marco was always most deeply interested.\nThe young prince was totally unlike his father. He was a true royal\nSamavian. He was bigger and stronger for his age than any man in the\ncountry, and he was as handsome as a young Viking god. More than this,\nhe had a lion's heart, and before he was sixteen, the shepherds and\nherdsmen had already begun to make songs about his young valor, and\nhis kingly courtesy, and generous kindness. Not only the shepherds and\nherdsmen sang them, but the people in the streets. The king, his father,\nhad always been jealous of him, even when he was only a beautiful,\nstately child whom the people roared with joy to see as he rode through\nthe streets. When he returned from his journeyings and found him a\nsplendid youth, he detested him. When the people began to clamor and\ndemand that he himself should abdicate, he became insane with rage, and\ncommitted such cruelties that the people ran mad themselves. One day\nthey stormed the palace, killed and overpowered the guards, and, rushing\ninto the royal apartments, burst in upon the king as he shuddered green\nwith terror and fury in his private room. He was king no more, and must\nleave the country, they vowed, as they closed round him with bared\nweapons and shook them in his face. Where was the prince? They must see\nhim and tell him their ultimatum. It was he whom they wanted for a king.\nThey trusted him and would obey him. They began to shout aloud his\nname, calling him in a sort of chant in unison, \"Prince Ivor--Prince\nIvor--Prince Ivor!\" But no answer came. The people of the palace had\nhidden themselves, and the place was utterly silent.\n\nThe king, despite his terror, could not help but sneer.\n\n\"Call him again,\" he said. \"He is afraid to come out of his hole!\"\n\nA savage fellow from the mountain fastnesses struck him on the mouth.\n\n\"He afraid!\" he shouted. \"If he does not come, it is because thou hast\nkilled him--and thou art a dead man!\"\n\nThis set them aflame with hotter burning. They broke away, leaving three\non guard, and ran about the empty palace rooms shouting the prince's\nname. But there was no answer. They sought him in a frenzy, bursting\nopen doors and flinging down every obstacle in their way. A page, found\nhidden in a closet, owned that he had seen His Royal Highness pass\nthrough a corridor early in the morning. He had been softly singing to\nhimself one of the shepherd's songs.\n\nAnd in this strange way out of the history of Samavia, five hundred\nyears before Marco's day, the young prince had walked--singing softly\nto himself the old song of Samavia's beauty and happiness. For he was\nnever seen again.\n\nIn every nook and cranny, high and low, they sought for him, believing\nthat the king himself had made him prisoner in some secret place, or\nhad privately had him killed. The fury of the people grew to frenzy.\nThere were new risings, and every few days the palace was attacked and\nsearched again. But no trace of the prince was found. He had vanished as\na star vanishes when it drops from its place in the sky. During a riot\nin the palace, when a last fruitless search was made, the king himself\nwas killed. A powerful noble who headed one of the uprisings made\nhimself king in his place. From that time, the once splendid little\nkingdom was like a bone fought for by dogs. Its pastoral peace was\nforgotten. It was torn and worried and shaken by stronger countries.\nIt tore and worried itself with internal fights. It assassinated kings\nand created new ones. No man was sure in his youth what ruler his\nmaturity would live under, or whether his children would die in useless\nfights, or through stress of poverty and cruel, useless laws. There were\nno more shepherds and herdsmen who were poets, but on the mountain sides\nand in the valleys sometimes some of the old songs were sung. Those most\nbeloved were songs about a Lost Prince whose name had been Ivor. If he\nhad been king, he would have saved Samavia, the verses said, and all\nbrave hearts believed that he would still return. In the modern cities,\none of the jocular cynical sayings was, \"Yes, that will happen when\nPrince Ivor comes again.\"\n\nIn his more childish days, Marco had been bitterly troubled by the\nunsolved mystery. Where had he gone--the Lost Prince? Had he been\nkilled, or had he been hidden away in a dungeon? But he was so big and\nbrave, he would have broken out of any dungeon. The boy had invented for\nhimself a dozen endings to the story.\n\n\"Did no one ever find his sword or his cap--or hear anything or guess\nanything about him ever--ever--ever?\" he would say restlessly again and\nagain.\n\nOne winter's night, as they sat together before a small fire in a cold\nroom in a cold city in Austria, he had been so eager and asked so many\nsearching questions, that his father gave him an answer he had never\ngiven him before, and which was a sort of ending to the story, though\nnot a satisfying one:\n\n\"Everybody guessed as you are guessing. A few very old shepherds in the\nmountains who like to believe ancient histories relate a story which\nmost people consider a kind of legend. It is that almost a hundred years\nafter the prince was lost, an old shepherd told a story his long-dead\nfather had confided to him in secret just before he died. The father had\nsaid that, going out in the early morning on the mountain side, he had\nfound in the forest what he at first thought to be the dead body of a\nbeautiful, boyish, young huntsman. Some enemy had plainly attacked him\nfrom behind and believed he had killed him. He was, however, not quite\ndead, and the shepherd dragged him into a cave where he himself often\ntook refuge from storms with his flocks. Since there was such riot and\ndisorder in the city, he was afraid to speak of what he had found; and,\nby the time he discovered that he was harboring the prince, the king\nhad already been killed, and an even worse man had taken possession of\nhis throne, and ruled Samavia with a blood-stained, iron hand. To the\nterrified and simple peasant the safest thing seemed to get the wounded\nyouth out of the country before there was any chance of his being\ndiscovered and murdered outright, as he would surely be. The cave in\nwhich he was hidden was not far from the frontier, and while he was\nstill so weak that he was hardly conscious of what befell him, he was\nsmuggled across it in a cart loaded with sheepskins, and left with some\nkind monks who did not know his rank or name. The shepherd went back to\nhis flocks and his mountains, and lived and died among them, always in\nterror of the changing rulers and their savage battles with each other.\nThe mountaineers said among themselves, as the generations succeeded\neach other, that the Lost Prince must have died young, because otherwise\nhe would have come back to his country and tried to restore its good,\nbygone days.\"\n\n\"Yes, he would have come,\" Marco said.\n\n\"He would have come if he had seen that he could help his people,\"\nLoristan answered, as if he were not reflecting on a story which was\nprobably only a kind of legend. \"But he was very young, and Samavia was\nin the hands of the new dynasty, and filled with his enemies. He could\nnot have crossed the frontier without an army. Still, I think he died\nyoung.\"\n\n[Illustration: He was the man who had spoken to him in Samavian.]\n\nIt was of this story that Marco was thinking as he walked, and perhaps\nthe thoughts that filled his mind expressed themselves in his face in\nsome way which attracted attention. As he was nearing Buckingham Palace,\na distinguished-looking well-dressed man with clever eyes caught sight\nof him, and, after looking at him keenly, slackened his pace as he\napproached him from the opposite direction. An observer might have\nthought he saw something which puzzled and surprised him. Marco didn't\nsee him at all, and still moved forward, thinking of the shepherds and\nthe prince. The well-dressed man began to walk still more slowly. When\nhe was quite close to Marco, he stopped and spoke to him--in the\nSamavian language.\n\n\"What is your name?\" he asked.\n\nMarco's training from his earliest childhood had been an extraordinary\nthing. His love for his father had made it simple and natural to him,\nand he had never questioned the reason for it. As he had been taught to\nkeep silence, he had been taught to control the expression of his face\nand the sound of his voice, and, above all, never to allow himself to\nlook startled. But for this he might have started at the extraordinary\nsound of the Samavian words suddenly uttered in a London street by an\nEnglish gentleman. He might even have answered the question in Samavian\nhimself. But he did not. He courteously lifted his cap and replied in\nEnglish:\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\nThe gentleman's clever eyes scrutinized him keenly. Then he also spoke\nin English.\n\n\"Perhaps you do not understand? I asked your name because you are very\nlike a Samavian I know,\" he said.\n\n\"I am Marco Loristan,\" the boy answered him.\n\nThe man looked straight into his eyes and smiled.\n\n\"That is not the name,\" he said. \"I beg your pardon, my boy.\"\n\nHe was about to go on, and had indeed taken a couple of steps away, when\nhe paused and turned to him again.\n\n\"You may tell your father that you are a very well-trained lad. I wanted\nto find out for myself.\" And he went on.\n\nMarco felt that his heart beat a little quickly. This was one of\nseveral incidents which had happened during the last three years, and\nmade him feel that he was living among things so mysterious that their\nvery mystery hinted at danger. But he himself had never before seemed\ninvolved in them. Why should it matter that he was well-behaved? Then he\nremembered something. The man had not said \"well-behaved,\" he had said\n\"well-_trained_.\" Well-trained in what way? He felt his forehead prickle\nslightly as he thought of the smiling, keen look which set itself so\nstraight upon him. Had he spoken to him in Samavian for an experiment,\nto see if he would be startled into forgetting that he had been trained\nto seem to know only the language of the country he was temporarily\nliving in? But he had not forgotten. He had remembered well, and was\nthankful that he had betrayed nothing. \"Even exiles may be Samavian\nsoldiers. I am one. You must be one,\" his father had said on that day\nlong ago when he had made him take his oath. Perhaps remembering his\ntraining was being a soldier. Never had Samavia needed help as she\nneeded it to-day. Two years before, a rival claimant to the throne had\nassassinated the then reigning king and his sons, and since then, bloody\nwar and tumult had raged. The new king was a powerful man, and had a\ngreat following of the worst and most self-seeking of the people.\nNeighboring countries had interfered for their own welfare's sake,\nand the newspapers had been full of stories of savage fighting and\natrocities, and of starving peasants.\n\nMarco had late one evening entered their lodgings to find Loristan\nwalking to and fro like a lion in a cage, a paper crushed and torn\nin his hands, and his eyes blazing. He had been reading of cruelties\nwrought upon innocent peasants and women and children. Lazarus was\nstanding staring at him with huge tears running down his cheeks. When\nMarco opened the door, the old soldier strode over to him, turned him\nabout, and led him out of the room.\n\n\"Pardon, sir, pardon!\" he sobbed. \"No one must see him, not even you.\nHe suffers so horribly.\"\n\nHe stood by a chair in Marco's own small bedroom, where he half pushed,\nhalf led him. He bent his grizzled head, and wept like a beaten child.\n\n\"Dear God of those who are in pain, assuredly it is now the time to give\nback to us our Lost Prince!\" he said, and Marco knew the words were a\nprayer, and wondered at the frenzied intensity of it, because it seemed\nso wild a thing to pray for the return of a youth who had died five\nhundred years before.\n\nWhen he reached the palace, he was still thinking of the man who had\nspoken to him. He was thinking of him even as he looked at the majestic\ngray stone building and counted the number of its stories and windows.\nHe walked round it that he might make a note in his memory of its size\nand form and its entrances, and guess at the size of its gardens. This\nhe did because it was part of his game, and part of his strange\ntraining.\n\nWhen he came back to the front, he saw that in the great entrance court\nwithin the high iron railings an elegant but quiet-looking closed\ncarriage was drawing up before the doorway. Marco stood and watched with\ninterest to see who would come out and enter it. He knew that kings and\nemperors who were not on parade looked merely like well-dressed private\ngentlemen, and often chose to go out as simply and quietly as other men.\nSo he thought that, perhaps, if he waited, he might see one of those\nwell-known faces which represent the highest rank and power in a\nmonarchical country, and which in times gone by had also represented the\npower over human life and death and liberty.\n\n\"I should like to be able to tell my father that I have seen the King\nand know his face, as I know the faces of the czar and the two\nemperors.\"\n\nThere was a little movement among the tall men-servants in the royal\nscarlet liveries, and an elderly man descended the steps attended by\nanother who walked behind him. He entered the carriage, the other man\nfollowed him, the door was closed, and the carriage drove through the\nentrance gates, where the sentries saluted.\n\nMarco was near enough to see distinctly. The two men were talking as if\ninterested. The face of the one farthest from him was the face he had\noften seen in shop-windows and newspapers. The boy made his quick,\nformal salute. It was the King; and, as he smiled and acknowledged his\ngreeting, he spoke to his companion.\n\n\"That fine lad salutes as if he belonged to the army,\" was what he said,\nthough Marco could not hear him.\n\nHis companion leaned forward to look through the window. When he caught\nsight of Marco, a singular expression crossed his face.\n\n\"He does belong to an army, sir,\" he answered, \"though he does not know\nit. His name is Marco Loristan.\"\n\nThen Marco saw him plainly for the first time. He was the man with the\nkeen eyes who had spoken to him in Samavian.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE RAT\n\n\nMarco would have wondered very much if he had heard the words, but, as\nhe did not hear them, he turned toward home wondering at something else.\nA man who was in intimate attendance on a king must be a person of\nimportance. He no doubt knew many things not only of his own ruler's\ncountry, but of the countries of other kings. But so few had really\nknown anything of poor little Samavia until the newspapers had begun to\ntell them of the horrors of its war--and who but a Samavian could speak\nits language? It would be an interesting thing to tell his father--that\na man who knew the King had spoken to him in Samavian, and had sent that\ncurious message.\n\nLater he found himself passing a side street and looked up it. It was so\nnarrow, and on either side of it were such old, tall, and sloping-walled\nhouses that it attracted his attention. It looked as if a bit of old\nLondon had been left to stand while newer places grew up and hid it\nfrom view. This was the kind of street he liked to pass through for\ncuriosity's sake. He knew many of them in the old quarters of many\ncities. He had lived in some of them. He could find his way home from\nthe other end of it. Another thing than its queerness attracted him.\nHe heard a clamor of boys' voices, and he wanted to see what they were\ndoing. Sometimes, when he had reached a new place and had had that\nlonely feeling, he had followed some boyish clamor of play or wrangling,\nand had found a temporary friend or so.\n\nHalf-way to the street's end there was an arched brick passage. The\nsound of the voices came from there--one of them high, and thinner and\nshriller than the rest. Marco tramped up to the arch and looked down\nthrough the passage. It opened on to a gray flagged space, shut in by\nthe railings of a black, deserted, and ancient graveyard behind a\nvenerable church which turned its face toward some other street. The\nboys were not playing, but listening to one of their number who was\nreading to them from a newspaper.\n\nMarco walked down the passage and listened also, standing in the dark\narched outlet at its end and watching the boy who read. He was a strange\nlittle creature with a big forehead, and deep eyes which were curiously\nsharp. But this was not all. He had a hunch back, his legs seemed small\nand crooked. He sat with them crossed before him on a rough wooden\nplatform set on low wheels, on which he evidently pushed himself about.\nNear him were a number of sticks stacked together as if they were\nrifles. One of the first things that Marco noticed was that he had a\nsavage little face marked with lines as if he had been angry all his\nlife.\n\n\"Hold your tongues, you fools!\" he shrilled out to some boys who\ninterrupted him. \"Don't you want to know anything, you ignorant swine?\"\n\nHe was as ill-dressed as the rest of them, but he did not speak in the\nCockney dialect. If he was of the riffraff of the streets, as his\ncompanions were, he was somehow different.\n\nThen he, by chance, saw Marco, who was standing in the arched end of the\npassage.\n\n\"What are you doing there listening?\" he shouted, and at once stooped to\npick up a stone and threw it at him. The stone hit Marco's shoulder, but\nit did not hurt him much. What he did not like was that another lad\nshould want to throw something at him before they had even exchanged\nboy-signs. He also did not like the fact that two other boys promptly\ntook the matter up by bending down to pick up stones also.\n\nHe walked forward straight into the group and stopped close to the\nhunchback.\n\n\"What did you do that for?\" he asked, in his rather deep young voice.\n\nHe was big and strong-looking enough to suggest that he was not a boy it\nwould be easy to dispose of, but it was not that which made the group\nstand still a moment to stare at him. It was something in himself--half\nof it a kind of impartial lack of anything like irritation at the\nstone-throwing. It was as if it had not mattered to him in the least.\nIt had not made him feel angry or insulted. He was only rather curious\nabout it. Because he was clean, and his hair and his shabby clothes were\nbrushed, the first impression given by his appearance as he stood in the\narchway was that he was a young \"toff\" poking his nose where it was not\nwanted; but, as he drew near, they saw that the well-brushed clothes\nwere worn, and there were patches on his shoes.\n\n\"What did you do that for?\" he asked, and he asked it merely as if he\nwanted to find out the reason.\n\n\"I'm not going to have you swells dropping in to my club as if it was\nyour own,\" said the hunchback.\n\n\"I'm not a swell, and I didn't know it was a club,\" Marco answered. \"I\nheard boys, and I thought I'd come and look. When I heard you reading\nabout Samavia, I wanted to hear.\"\n\nHe looked at the reader with his silent-expressioned eyes.\n\n\"You needn't have thrown a stone,\" he added. \"They don't do it at men's\nclubs. I'll go away.\"\n\nHe turned about as if he were going, but, before he had taken three\nsteps, the hunchback hailed him unceremoniously.\n\n\"Hi!\" he called out. \"Hi, you!\"\n\n\"What do you want?\" said Marco.\n\n\"I bet you don't know where Samavia is, or what they're fighting about.\"\nThe hunchback threw the words at him.\n\n\"Yes, I do. It's north of Beltrazo and east of Jiardasia, and they are\nfighting because one party has assassinated King Maran, and the other\nwill not let them crown Nicola Iarovitch. And why should they? He's a\nbrigand, and hasn't a drop of royal blood in him.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" reluctantly admitted the hunchback. \"You do know that much, do\nyou? Come back here.\"\n\nMarco turned back, while the boys still stared. It was as if two leaders\nor generals were meeting for the first time, and the rabble, looking on,\nwondered what would come of their encounter.\n\n\"The Samavians of the Iarovitch party are a bad lot and want only bad\nthings,\" said Marco, speaking first. \"They care nothing for Samavia.\nThey only care for money and the power to make laws which will serve\nthem and crush everybody else. They know Nicola is a weak man, and that,\nif they can crown him king, they can make him do what they like.\"\n\nThe fact that he spoke first, and that, though he spoke in a steady\nboyish voice without swagger, he somehow seemed to take it for granted\nthat they would listen, made his place for him at once. Boys are\nimpressionable creatures, and they know a leader when they see him. The\nhunchback fixed glittering eyes on him. The rabble began to murmur.\n\n\"Rat! Rat!\" several voices cried at once in good strong Cockney. \"Arst\n'im some more, Rat!\"\n\n\"Is that what they call you?\" Marco asked the hunchback.\n\n\"It's what I called myself,\" he answered resentfully. \"'The Rat.' Look\nat me! Crawling round on the ground like this! Look at me!\"\n\nHe made a gesture ordering his followers to move aside, and began to\npush himself rapidly, with queer darts this side and that round the\ninclosure. He bent his head and body, and twisted his face, and made\nstrange animal-like movements. He even uttered sharp squeaks as he\nrushed here and there--as a rat might have done when it was being\nhunted. He did it as if he were displaying an accomplishment, and his\nfollowers' laughter was applause.\n\n\"Wasn't I like a rat?\" he demanded, when he suddenly stopped.\n\n\"You made yourself like one on purpose,\" Marco answered. \"You do it for\nfun.\"\n\n\"Not so much fun,\" said The Rat. \"I feel like one. Every one's my enemy.\nI'm vermin. I can't fight or defend myself unless I bite. I can bite,\nthough.\" And he showed two rows of fierce, strong, white teeth, sharper\nat the points than human teeth usually are. \"I bite my father when he\ngets drunk and beats me. I've bitten him till he's learned to remember.\"\nHe laughed a shrill, squeaking laugh. \"He hasn't tried it for three\nmonths--even when he was drunk--and he's always drunk.\" Then he laughed\nagain still more shrilly. \"He's a gentleman,\" he said. \"I'm a\ngentleman's son. He was a Master at a big school until he was kicked\nout--that was when I was four and my mother died. I'm thirteen now. How\nold are you?\"\n\n\"I'm twelve,\" answered Marco.\n\nThe Rat twisted his face enviously.\n\n\"I wish I was your size! Are you a gentleman's son? You look as if you\nwere.\"\n\n\"I'm a very poor man's son,\" was Marco's answer. \"My father is a\nwriter.\"\n\n\"Then, ten to one, he's a sort of gentleman,\" said The Rat. Then quite\nsuddenly he threw another question at him. \"What's the name of the other\nSamavian party?\"\n\n\"The Maranovitch. The Maranovitch and the Iarovitch have been fighting\nwith each other for five hundred years. First one dynasty rules, and\nthen the other gets in when it has killed somebody as it killed King\nMaran,\" Marco answered without hesitation.\n\n\"What was the name of the dynasty that ruled before they began fighting?\nThe first Maranovitch assassinated the last of them,\" The Rat asked him.\n\n\"The Fedorovitch,\" said Marco. \"The last one was a bad king.\"\n\n\"His son was the one they never found again,\" said The Rat. \"The one\nthey call the Lost Prince.\"\n\nMarco would have started but for his long training in exterior\nself-control. It was so strange to hear his dream-hero spoken of in this\nback alley in a slum, and just after he had been thinking of him.\n\n\"What do you know about him?\" he asked, and, as he did so, he saw the\ngroup of vagabond lads draw nearer.\n\n\"Not much. I only read something about him in a torn magazine I found in\nthe street,\" The Rat answered. \"The man that wrote about him said he was\nonly part of a legend, and he laughed at people for believing in him. He\nsaid it was about time that he should turn up again if he intended to.\nI've invented things about him because these chaps like to hear me tell\nthem. They're only stories.\"\n\n\"We likes 'im,\" a voice called out, \"becos 'e wos the right sort; 'e'd\nfight, 'e would, if 'e was in Samavia now.\"\n\nMarco rapidly asked himself how much he might say. He decided and spoke\nto them all.\n\n\"He is not part of a legend. He's part of Samavian history,\" he said.\n\"I know something about him too.\"\n\n\"How did you find it out?\" asked The Rat.\n\n\"Because my father's a writer, he's obliged to have books and papers,\nand he knows things. I like to read, and I go into the free libraries.\nYou can always get books and papers there. Then I ask my father\nquestions. All the newspapers are full of things about Samavia just\nnow.\" Marco felt that this was an explanation which betrayed nothing.\nIt was true that no one could open a newspaper at this period without\nseeing news and stories of Samavia.\n\nThe Rat saw possible vistas of information opening up before him.\n\n\"Sit down here,\" he said, \"and tell us what you know about him. Sit\ndown, you fellows.\"\n\nThere was nothing to sit on but the broken flagged pavement, but that\nwas a small matter. Marco himself had sat on flags or bare ground often\nenough before, and so had the rest of the lads. He took his place near\nThe Rat, and the others made a semicircle in front of them. The two\nleaders had joined forces, so to speak, and the followers fell into line\nat \"attention.\"\n\nThen the new-comer began to talk. It was a good story, that of the Lost\nPrince, and Marco told it in a way which gave it reality. How could he\nhelp it? He knew, as they could not, that it was real. He who had pored\nover maps of little Samavia since his seventh year, who had studied them\nwith his father, knew it as a country he could have found his way to any\npart of if he had been dropped in any forest or any mountain of it. He\nknew every highway and byway, and in the capital city of Melzarr could\nalmost have made his way blindfolded. He knew the palaces and the forts,\nthe churches, the poor streets and the rich ones. His father had once\nshown him a plan of the royal palace which they had studied together\nuntil the boy knew each apartment and corridor in it by heart. But this\nhe did not speak of. He knew it was one of the things to be silent\nabout. But of the mountains and the emerald velvet meadows climbing\ntheir sides and only ending where huge bare crags and peaks began, he\ncould speak. He could make pictures of the wide fertile plains where\nherds of wild horses fed, or raced and sniffed the air; he could\ndescribe the fertile valleys where clear rivers ran and flocks of sheep\npastured on deep sweet grass. He could speak of them because he could\noffer a good enough reason for his knowledge of them. It was not the\nonly reason he had for his knowledge, but it was one which would serve\nwell enough.\n\n\"That torn magazine you found had more than one article about Samavia in\nit,\" he said to The Rat. \"The same man wrote four. I read them all in a\nfree library. He had been to Samavia, and knew a great deal about it.\nHe said it was one of the most beautiful countries he had ever traveled\nin--and the most fertile. That's what they all say of it.\"\n\nThe group before him knew nothing of fertility or open country. They\nonly knew London back streets and courts. Most of them had never\ntraveled as far as the public parks, and in fact scarcely believed in\ntheir existence. They were a rough lot, and as they had stared at Marco\nat first sight of him, so they continued to stare at him as he talked.\nWhen he told of the tall Samavians who had been like giants centuries\nago, and who had hunted the wild horses and captured and trained them to\nobedience by a sort of strong and gentle magic, their mouths fell open.\nThis was the sort of thing to allure any boy's imagination.\n\n\"Blimme, if I wouldn't 'ave liked ketchin' one o' them 'orses,\" broke in\none of the audience, and his exclamation was followed by a dozen of like\nnature from the others. Who wouldn't have liked \"ketchin' one\"?\n\nWhen he told of the deep endless-seeming forests, and of the herdsmen\nand shepherds who played on their pipes and made songs about high deeds\nand bravery, they grinned with pleasure without knowing they were\ngrinning. They did not really know that in this neglected,\nbroken-flagged inclosure, shut in on one side by smoke-blackened,\npoverty-stricken houses, and on the other by a deserted and forgotten\nsunken graveyard, they heard the rustle of green forest boughs where\nbirds nested close, the swish of the summer wind in the river reeds, and\nthe tinkle and laughter and rush of brooks running.\n\nThey heard more or less of it all through the Lost Prince story, because\nPrince Ivor had loved lowland woods and mountain forests and all\nout-of-door life. When Marco pictured him tall and strong-limbed and\nyoung, winning all the people when he rode smiling among them, the boys\ngrinned again with unconscious pleasure.\n\n\"Wisht 'e 'adn't got lost!\" some one cried out.\n\nWhen they heard of the unrest and dissatisfaction of the Samavians, they\nbegan to get restless themselves. When Marco reached the part of the\nstory in which the mob rushed into the palace and demanded their prince\nfrom the king, they ejaculated scraps of bad language. \"The old geezer\nhad got him hidden somewhere in some dungeon, or he'd killed him out an'\nout--that's what he'd been up to!\" they clamored. \"Wisht the lot of us\nhad been there then--wisht we 'ad. We'd 'ave give' 'im wot for, anyway!\"\n\n\"An' 'im walkin' out o' the place so early in the mornin' just singin'\nlike that! 'E 'ad 'im follered an' done for!\" they decided with various\nexclamations of boyish wrath. Somehow, the fact that the handsome royal\nlad had strolled into the morning sunshine singing made them more\nsavage. Their language was extremely bad at this point.\n\nBut if it was bad here, it became worse when the old shepherd found\nthe young huntsman's half-dead body in the forest. He _had_ \"bin 'done\nfor' _in the back_! 'E'd bin give' no charnst. G-r-r-r!\" they groaned\nin chorus. \"Wisht\" _they'd_ \"bin there when 'e'd bin 'it!\" They'd\n\"'ave done fur somebody\" themselves. It was a story which had a queer\neffect on them. It made them think they saw things; it fired their\nblood; it set them wanting to fight for ideals they knew nothing\nabout--adventurous things, for instance, and high and noble young\nprinces who were full of the possibility of great and good deeds.\nSitting upon the broken flagstones of the bit of ground behind the\ndeserted graveyard, they were suddenly dragged into the world of\nromance, and noble young princes and great and good deeds became as\nreal as the sunken gravestones, and far more interesting.\n\nAnd then the smuggling across the frontier of the unconscious prince in\nthe bullock cart loaded with sheepskins! They held their breaths. Would\nthe old shepherd get him past the line! Marco, who was lost in the\nrecital himself, told it as if he had been present. He felt as if he\nhad, and as this was the first time he had ever told it to thrilled\nlisteners, his imagination got him in its grip, and his heart jumped in\nhis breast as he was sure the old man's must have done when the guard\nstopped his cart and asked him what he was carrying out of the country.\nHe knew he must have had to call up all his strength to force his voice\ninto steadiness.\n\nAnd then the good monks! He had to stop to explain what a monk was, and\nwhen he described the solitude of the ancient monastery, and its walled\ngardens full of flowers and old simples to be used for healing, and the\nwise monks walking in the silence and the sun, the boys stared a little\nhelplessly, but still as if they were vaguely pleased by the picture.\n\nAnd then there was no more to tell--no more. There it broke off, and\nsomething like a low howl of dismay broke from the semicircle.\n\n\"Aw!\" they protested, \"it 'adn't ought to stop there! Ain't there no\nmore? Is that all there is?\"\n\n\"It's all that was ever known really. And that last part might only be\na sort of story made up by somebody. But I believe it myself.\"\n\nThe Rat had listened with burning eyes. He had sat biting his\nfinger-nails, as was a trick of his when he was excited or angry.\n\n\"Tell you what!\" he exclaimed suddenly. \"This was what happened. It was\nsome of the Maranovitch fellows that tried to kill him. They meant to\nkill his father and make their own man king, and they knew the people\nwouldn't stand it if young Ivor was alive. They just stabbed him in the\nback, the fiends! I dare say they heard the old shepherd coming, and\nleft him for dead and ran.\"\n\n\"Right, oh! That was it!\" the lads agreed. \"Yer right there, Rat!\"\n\n\"When he got well,\" The Rat went on feverishly, still biting his nails,\n\"he couldn't go back. He was only a boy. The other fellow had been\ncrowned, and his followers felt strong because they'd just conquered\nthe country. He could have done nothing without an army, and he was too\nyoung to raise one. Perhaps he thought he'd wait till he was old enough\nto know what to do. I dare say he went away and had to work for his\nliving as if he'd never been a prince at all. Then perhaps sometime he\nmarried somebody and had a son, and told him as a secret who he was and\nall about Samavia.\" The Rat began to look vengeful. \"If I'd bin him I'd\nhave told him not to forget what the Maranovitch had done to me. I'd\nhave told him that if I couldn't get back the throne, he must see what\nhe could do when he grew to be a man. And I'd have made him swear,\nif he got it back, to take it out of them or their children or their\nchildren's children in torture and killing. I'd have made him swear not\nto leave a Maranovitch alive. And I'd have told him that, if he couldn't\ndo it in his life, he must pass the oath on to his son and his son's\nson, as long as there was a Fedorovitch on earth. Wouldn't you?\" he\ndemanded hotly of Marco.\n\nMarco's blood was also hot, but it was a different kind of blood, and he\nhad talked too much to a very sane man.\n\n\"No,\" he said slowly. \"What would have been the use? It wouldn't have\ndone Samavia any good, and it wouldn't have done him any good to torture\nand kill people. Better keep them alive and make them do things for the\ncountry. If you're a patriot, you think of the country.\" He wanted to\nadd \"That's what my father says,\" but he did not.\n\n\"Torture 'em first and then attend to the country,\" snapped The Rat.\n\"What would you have told your son if you'd been Ivor?\"\n\n\"I'd have told him to learn everything about Samavia--and all the things\nkings have to know--and study things about laws and other countries--and\nabout keeping silent--and about governing himself as if he were a\ngeneral commanding soldiers in battle--so that he would never do\nanything he did not mean to do or could be ashamed of doing after it was\nover. And I'd have asked him to tell his son's sons to tell their sons\nto learn the same things. So, you see, however long the time was, there\nwould always be a king getting ready for Samavia--when Samavia really\nwanted him. And he would be a real king.\"\n\nHe stopped himself suddenly and looked at the staring semicircle.\n\n\"I didn't make that up myself,\" he said. \"I have heard a man who reads\nand knows things say it. I believe the Lost Prince would have had the\nsame thoughts. If he had, and told them to his son, there has been a\nline of kings in training for Samavia for five hundred years, and\nperhaps one is walking about the streets of Vienna, or Budapest, or\nParis, or London now, and he'd be ready if the people found out about\nhim and called him.\"\n\n\"Wisht they would!\" some one yelled.\n\n\"It would be a queer secret to know all the time when no one else knew\nit,\" The Rat communed with himself as it were, \"that you were a king and\nyou ought to be on a throne wearing a crown. I wonder if it would make a\nchap look different?\"\n\nHe laughed his squeaky laugh, and then turned in his sudden way to\nMarco:\n\n\"But he'd be a fool to give up the vengeance. What is your name?\"\n\n\"Marco Loristan. What's yours? It isn't The Rat really.\"\n\n\"It's Jem _Rat_cliffe. That's pretty near. Where do you live?\"\n\n\"No. 7 Philibert Place.\"\n\n\"This club is a soldiers' club,\" said The Rat. \"It's called the Squad.\nI'm the captain. 'Tention, you fellows! Let's show him.\"\n\nThe semicircle sprang to its feet. There were about twelve lads\naltogether, and, when they stood upright, Marco saw at once that for\nsome reason they were accustomed to obeying the word of command with\nmilitary precision.\n\n\"Form in line!\" ordered The Rat.\n\nThey did it at once, and held their backs and legs straight and their\nheads up amazingly well. Each had seized one of the sticks which had\nbeen stacked together like guns.\n\nThe Rat himself sat up straight on his platform. There was actually\nsomething military in the bearing of his lean body. His voice lost its\nsqueak and its sharpness became commanding.\n\nHe put the dozen lads through the drill as if he had been a smart young\nofficer. And the drill itself was prompt and smart enough to have done\ncredit to practiced soldiers in barracks. It made Marco involuntarily\nstand very straight himself, and watch with surprised interest.\n\n\"That's good!\" he exclaimed when it was at an end. \"How did you learn\nthat?\"\n\nThe Rat made a savage gesture.\n\n\"If I'd had legs to stand on, I'd have been a soldier!\" he said. \"I'd\nhave enlisted in any regiment that would take me. I don't care for\nanything else.\"\n\nSuddenly his face changed, and he shouted a command to his followers.\n\n\"Turn your backs!\" he ordered.\n\nAnd they did turn their backs and looked through the railings of the old\nchurchyard. Marco saw that they were obeying an order which was not new\nto them. The Rat had thrown his arm up over his eyes and covered them.\nHe held it there for several moments, as if he did not want to be seen.\nMarco turned his back as the rest had done. All at once he understood\nthat, though The Rat was not crying, yet he was feeling something which\nanother boy would possibly have broken down under.\n\n\"All right!\" he shouted presently, and dropped his ragged-sleeved arm\nand sat up straight again.\n\n\"I want to go to war!\" he said hoarsely. \"I want to fight! I want to\nlead a lot of men into battle! And I haven't got any legs. Sometimes it\ntakes the pluck out of me.\"\n\n\"You've not grown up yet!\" said Marco. \"You might get strong.\"\n\nNo one knows what is going to happen. How did you learn to drill the\nclub?\"\n\n\"I hang about barracks. I watch and listen. I follow soldiers. If I\ncould get books, I'd read about wars. I can't go to libraries as you\ncan. I can do nothing but scuffle about like a rat.\"\n\n\"I can take you to some libraries,\" said Marco. \"There are places where\nboys can get in. And I can get some papers from my father.\"\n\n\"Can you?\" said The Rat. \"Do you want to join the club?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" Marco answered. \"I'll speak to my father about it.\"\n\nHe said it because the hungry longing for companionship in his own mind\nhad found a sort of response in the queer hungry look in The Rat's eyes.\nHe wanted to see him again. Strange creature as he was, there was\nattraction in him. Scuffling about on his low wheeled platform, he had\ndrawn this group of rough lads to him and made himself their commander.\nThey obeyed him; they listened to his stories and harangues about war\nand soldiering; they let him drill them and give them orders. Marco knew\nthat, when he told his father about him, he would be interested. The boy\nwanted to hear what Loristan would say.\n\n\"I'm going home now,\" he said. \"If you're going to be here to-morrow,\nI will try to come.\"\n\n\"We shall be here,\" The Rat answered. \"It's our barracks.\"\n\nMarco drew himself up smartly and made his salute as if to a superior\nofficer. Then he wheeled about and marched through the brick archway,\nand the sound of his boyish tread was as regular and decided as if he\nhad been a man keeping time with his regiment.\n\n\"He's been drilled himself,\" said The Rat. \"He knows as much as I do.\"\n\nAnd he sat up and stared down the passage with new interest.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\n\"SILENCE IS STILL THE ORDER\"\n\n\nThey were even poorer than usual just now, and the supper Marco and his\nfather sat down to was scant enough. Lazarus stood upright behind his\nmaster's chair and served him with strictest ceremony. Their poor\nlodgings were always kept with a soldierly cleanliness and order. When\nan object could be polished it was forced to shine, no grain of dust was\nallowed to lie undisturbed, and this perfection was not attained through\nthe ministrations of a lodging house slavey. Lazarus made himself\nextremely popular by taking the work of caring for his master's rooms\nentirely out of the hands of the overburdened maids of all work. He had\nlearned to do many things in his young days in barracks. He carried\nabout with him coarse bits of table-cloths and towels, which he\nlaundered as if they had been the finest linen. He mended, he patched,\nhe darned, and in the hardest fight the poor must face--the fight with\ndirt and dinginess--he always held his own. They had nothing but dry\nbread and coffee this evening, but Lazarus had made the coffee and the\nbread was good.\n\nAs Marco ate, he told his father the story of The Rat and his followers.\nLoristan listened, as the boy had known he would, with the far-off,\nintently-thinking smile in his dark eyes. It was a look which always\nfascinated Marco because it meant that he was thinking so many things.\nPerhaps he would tell some of them and perhaps he would not. His spell\nover the boy lay in the fact that to him he seemed like a wonderful book\nof which one had only glimpses. It was full of pictures and adventures\nwhich were true, and one could not help continually making guesses about\nthem. Yes, the feeling that Marco had was that his father's attraction\nfor him was a sort of spell, and that others felt the same thing. When\nhe stood and talked to commoner people, he held his tall body with\nsingular quiet grace which was like power. He never stirred or moved\nhimself as if he were nervous or uncertain. He could hold his hands (he\nhad beautiful slender and strong hands) quite still; he could stand on\nhis fine arched feet without shuffling them. He could sit without any\nungrace or restlessness. His mind knew what his body should do, and gave\nit orders without speaking, and his fine limbs and muscles and nerves\nobeyed. So he could stand still and at ease and look at the people he\nwas talking to, and they always looked at him and listened to what he\nsaid, and somehow, courteous and uncondescending as his manner\nunfailingly was, it used always to seem to Marco as if he were \"giving\nan audience\" as kings gave them.\n\nHe had often seen people bow very low when they went away from him, and\nmore than once it had happened that some humble person had stepped out\nof his presence backward, as people do when retiring before a sovereign.\nAnd yet his bearing was the quietest and least assuming in the world.\n\n\"And they were talking about Samavia? And he knew the story of the Lost\nPrince?\" he said ponderingly. \"Even in that place!\"\n\n\"He wants to hear about wars--he wants to talk about them,\" Marco\nanswered. \"If he could stand and were old enough, he would go and fight\nfor Samavia himself.\"\n\n\"It is a blood-drenched and sad place now!\" said Loristan. \"The people\nare mad when they are not heartbroken and terrified.\"\n\nSuddenly Marco struck the table with a sounding slap of his boy's hand.\nHe did it before he realized any intention in his own mind.\n\n\"Why should either one of the Iarovitch or one of the Maranovitch be\nking!\" he cried. \"They were only savage peasants when they first fought\nfor the crown hundreds of years ago. The most savage one got it, and\nthey have been fighting ever since. Only the Fedorovitch were born\nkings. There is only one man in the world who has the right to the\nthrone--and I don't know whether he is in the world or not. But I\nbelieve he is! I do!\"\n\nLoristan looked at his hot twelve-year-old face with a reflective\ncuriousness. He saw that the flame which had leaped up in him had leaped\nwithout warning--just as a fierce heart-beat might have shaken him.\n\n\"You mean--?\" he suggested softly.\n\n\"Ivor Fedorovitch. King Ivor he ought to be. And the people would obey\nhim, and the good days would come again.\"\n\n\"It is five hundred years since Ivor Fedorovitch left the good monks.\"\nLoristan still spoke softly.\n\n\"But, Father,\" Marco protested, \"even The Rat said what you said--that\nhe was too young to be able to come back while the Maranovitch were in\npower. And he would have to work and have a home, and perhaps he is as\npoor as we are. But when he had a son he would call him Ivor and _tell_\nhim--and his son would call _his_ son Ivor and tell _him_--and it would\ngo on and on. They could never call their eldest sons anything but Ivor.\nAnd what you said about the training would be true. There would always\nbe a king being trained for Samavia, and ready to be called.\" In the\nfire of his feelings he sprang from his chair and stood upright. \"Why!\nThere may be a king of Samavia in some city now who knows he is king,\nand, when he reads about the fighting among his people, his blood gets\nred-hot. They're his own people--his very own! He ought to go to\nthem--he ought to go and tell them who he is! Don't you think he ought,\nFather?\"\n\n\"It would not be as easy as it seems to a boy,\" Loristan answered.\n\"There are many countries which would have something to say--Russia\nwould have her word, and Austria, and Germany; and England never is\nsilent. But, if he were a strong man and knew how to make strong friends\nin silence, he might sometime be able to declare himself openly.\"\n\n\"But if he is anywhere, some one--some Samavian--ought to go and look\nfor him. It ought to be a Samavian who is very clever and a patriot--\"\nHe stopped at a flash of recognition. \"Father!\" he cried out. \"Father!\nYou--you are the one who could find him if any one in the world could.\nBut perhaps--\" and he stopped a moment again because new thoughts rushed\nthrough his mind. \"Have _you_ ever looked for him?\" he asked hesitating.\n\nPerhaps he had asked a stupid question--perhaps his father had always\nbeen looking for him, perhaps that was his secret and his work.\n\nBut Loristan did not look as if he thought him stupid. Quite the\ncontrary. He kept his handsome eyes fixed on him still in that curious\nway, as if he were studying him--as if he were much more than twelve\nyears old, and he were deciding to tell him something.\n\n\"Comrade at arms,\" he said, with the smile which always gladdened\nMarco's heart, \"you have kept your oath of allegiance like a man. You\nwere not seven years old when you took it. You are growing older.\nSilence is still the order, but you are man enough to be told more.\" He\npaused and looked down, and then looked up again, speaking in a low\ntone. \"I have not looked for him,\" he said, \"because--I believe I know\nwhere he is.\"\n\nMarco caught his breath.\n\n\"Father!\" He said only that word. He could say no more. He knew he must\nnot ask questions. \"Silence is still the order.\" But as they faced each\nother in their dingy room at the back of the shabby house on the side\nof the roaring common road--as Lazarus stood stock-still behind his\nfather's chair and kept his eyes fixed on the empty coffee cups and\nthe dry bread plate, and everything looked as poor as things always\ndid--there was a king of Samavia--an Ivor Fedorovitch with the blood of\nthe Lost Prince in his veins--alive in some town or city this moment!\nAnd Marco's own father knew where he was!\n\nHe glanced at Lazarus, but, though the old soldier's face looked as\nexpressionless as if it were cut out of wood, Marco realized that he\nknew this thing and had always known it. He had been a comrade at arms\nall his life. He continued to stare at the bread plate.\n\nLoristan spoke again and in an even lower voice. \"The Samavians who are\npatriots and thinkers,\" he said, \"formed themselves into a secret party\nabout eighty years ago. They formed it when they had no reason for\nhope, but they formed it because one of them discovered that an Ivor\nFedorovitch was living. He was head forester on a great estate in the\nAustrian Alps. The nobleman he served had always thought him a mystery\nbecause he had the bearing and speech of a man who had not been born a\nservant, and his methods in caring for the forests and game were those\nof a man who was educated and had studied his subject. But he never was\nfamiliar or assuming, and never professed superiority over any of his\nfellows. He was a man of great stature, and was extraordinarily brave\nand silent. The nobleman who was his master made a sort of companion\nof him when they hunted together. Once he took him with him when he\ntraveled to Samavia to hunt wild horses. He found that he knew the\ncountry strangely well, and that he was familiar with Samavian hunting\nand customs. Before he returned to Austria, the man obtained permission\nto go to the mountains alone. He went among the shepherds and made\nfriends among them, asking many questions.\n\n\"One night around a forest fire he heard the songs about the Lost Prince\nwhich had not been forgotten even after nearly five hundred years had\npassed. The shepherds and herdsmen talked about Prince Ivor, and told\nold stories about him, and related the prophecy that he would come back\nand bring again Samavia's good days. He might come only in the body of\none of his descendants, but it would be his spirit which came, because\nhis spirit would never cease to love Samavia. One very old shepherd\ntottered to his feet and lifted his face to the myriad stars bestrewn\nlike jewels in the blue sky above the forest trees, and he wept and\nprayed aloud that the great God would send their king to them. And the\nstranger huntsman stood upright also and lifted his face to the stars.\nAnd, though he said no word, the herdsman nearest to him saw tears on\nhis cheeks--great, heavy tears. The next day, the stranger went to the\nmonastery where the order of good monks lived who had taken care of the\nLost Prince. When he had left Samavia, the secret society was formed,\nand the members of it knew that an Ivor Fedorovitch had passed through\nhis ancestors' country as the servant of another man. But the secret\nsociety was only a small one, and, though it has been growing ever since\nand it has done good deeds and good work in secret, the huntsman died an\nold man before it was strong enough even to dare to tell Samavia what it\nknew.\"\n\n\"Had he a son?\" cried Marco. \"Had he a son?\"\n\n\"Yes. He had a son. His name was Ivor. And he was trained as I told you.\nThat part I knew to be true, though I should have believed it was true\neven if I had not known. There has _always_ been a king ready for\nSamavia--even when he has labored with his hands and served others. Each\none took the oath of allegiance.\"\n\n\"As I did?\" said Marco, breathless with excitement. When one is twelve\nyears old, to be so near a Lost Prince who might end wars is a thrilling\nthing.\n\n\"The same,\" answered Loristan.\n\nMarco threw up his hand in salute.\n\n\"'Here grows a man for Samavia! God be thanked!'\" he quoted. \"And _he_\nis somewhere? And you know?\"\n\nLoristan bent his head in acquiescence.\n\n\"For years much secret work has been done, and the Fedorovitch party has\ngrown until it is much greater and more powerful than the other parties\ndream. The larger countries are tired of the constant war and disorder\nin Samavia. Their interests are disturbed by them, and they are deciding\nthat they must have peace and laws which can be counted on. There have\nbeen Samavian patriots who have spent their lives in trying to bring\nthis about by making friends in the most powerful capitals, and working\nsecretly for the future good of their own land. Because Samavia is so\nsmall and uninfluential, it has taken a long time but when King Maran\nand his family were assassinated and the war broke out, there were great\npowers which began to say that if some king of good blood and reliable\ncharacteristics were given the crown, he should be upheld.\"\n\n\"_His_ blood,\"--Marco's intensity made his voice drop almost to a\nwhisper,--\"_his_ blood has been trained for five hundred years, Father!\nIf it comes true--\" though he laughed a little, he was obliged to wink\nhis eyes hard because suddenly he felt tears rush into them, which no\nboy likes--\"the shepherds will have to make a new song--it will have to\nbe a shouting one about a prince going away and a king coming back!\"\n\n\"They are a devout people and observe many an ancient rite and ceremony.\nThey will chant prayers and burn altar-fires on their mountain sides,\"\nLoristan said. \"But the end is not yet--the end is not yet. Sometimes it\nseems that perhaps it is near--but God knows!\"\n\nThen there leaped back upon Marco the story he had to tell, but which he\nhad held back for the last--the story of the man who spoke Samavian and\ndrove in the carriage with the King. He knew now that it might mean some\nimportant thing which he could not have before suspected.\n\n\"There is something I must tell you,\" he said.\n\nHe had learned to relate incidents in few but clear words when he\nrelated them to his father. It had been part of his training. Loristan\nhad said that he might sometime have a story to tell when he had but few\nmoments to tell it in--some story which meant life or death to some one.\nHe told this one quickly and well. He made Loristan see the well-dressed\nman with the deliberate manner and the keen eyes, and he made him hear\nhis voice when he said, \"Tell your father that you are a very\nwell-trained lad.\"\n\n\"I am glad he said that. He is a man who knows what training is,\" said\nLoristan. \"He is a person who knows what all Europe is doing, and almost\nall that it will do. He is an ambassador from a powerful and great\ncountry. If he saw that you are a well-trained and fine lad, it\nmight--it might even be good for Samavia.\"\n\n\"Would it matter that _I_ was well-trained? _Could_ it matter to Samavia?\"\nMarco cried out.\n\nLoristan paused for a moment--watching him gravely--looking him\nover--his big, well-built boy's frame, his shabby clothes, and his\neagerly burning eyes.\n\nHe smiled one of his slow wonderful smiles.\n\n\"Yes. It might even matter to Samavia!\" he answered.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nTHE DRILL AND THE SECRET PARTY\n\n\nLoristan did not forbid Marco to pursue his acquaintance with The Rat\nand his followers.\n\n\"You will find out for yourself whether they are friends for you or\nnot,\" he said. \"You will know in a few days, and then you can make your\nown decision. You have known lads in various countries, and you are a\ngood judge of them, I think. You will soon see whether they are going to\nbe _men_ or mere rabble. The Rat now--how does he strike you?\"\n\nAnd the handsome eyes held their keen look of questioning.\n\n\"He'd be a brave soldier if he could stand,\" said Marco, thinking him\nover. \"But he might be cruel.\"\n\n\"A lad who might make a brave soldier cannot be disdained, but a man\nwho is cruel is a fool. Tell him that from me,\" Loristan answered. \"He\nwastes force--his own and the force of the one he treats cruelly. Only\na fool wastes force.\"\n\n\"May I speak of you sometimes?\" asked Marco.\n\n\"Yes. You will know how. You will remember the things about which\nsilence is the order.\"\n\n\"I never forget them,\" said Marco. \"I have been trying not to, for such\na long time.\"\n\n\"You have succeeded well, Comrade!\" returned Loristan, from his\nwriting-table, to which he had gone and where he was turning over\npapers.\n\nA strong impulse overpowered the boy. He marched over to the table and\nstood very straight, making his soldierly young salute, his whole body\nglowing.\n\n\"Father!\" he said, \"you don't know how I love you! I wish you were a\ngeneral and I might die in battle for you. When I look at you, I long\nand long to do something for you a boy could not do. I would die of a\nthousand wounds rather than disobey you--or Samavia!\"\n\nHe seized Loristan's hand, and knelt on one knee and kissed it. An\nEnglish or American boy could not have done such a thing from unaffected\nnatural impulse. But he was of warm Southern blood.\n\n\"I took my oath of allegiance to you, Father, when I took it to Samavia.\nIt seems as if you were Samavia, too,\" he said, and kissed his hand\nagain.\n\nLoristan had turned toward him with one of the movements which were full\nof dignity and grace. Marco, looking up at him, felt that there was\nalways a certain remote stateliness in him which made it seem quite\nnatural that any one should bend the knee and kiss his hand.\n\nA sudden great tenderness glowed in his father's face as he raised the\nboy and put his hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Comrade,\" he said, \"you don't know how much I love you--and what reason\nthere is that we should love each other! You don't know how I have been\nwatching you, and thanking God each year that here grew a man for\nSamavia. That I know you are--a _man_, though you have lived but twelve\nyears. Twelve years may grow a man--or prove that a man will never grow,\nthough a human thing he may remain for ninety years. This year may be\nfull of strange things for both of us. We cannot know _what_ I may have\nto ask you to do for me--and for Samavia. Perhaps such a thing as no\ntwelve-year-old boy has ever done before.\"\n\n\"Every night and every morning,\" said Marco, \"I shall pray that I may be\ncalled to do it, and that I may do it well.\"\n\n\"You will do it well, Comrade, if you are called. That I could make\noath,\" Loristan answered him.\n\nThe Squad had collected in the inclosure behind the church when Marco\nappeared at the arched end of the passage. The boys were drawn up with\ntheir rifles, but they all wore a rather dogged and sullen look. The\nexplanation which darted into Marco's mind was that this was because The\nRat was in a bad humor. He sat crouched together on his platform biting\nhis nails fiercely, his elbows on his updrawn knees, his face twisted\ninto a hideous scowl. He did not look around, or even look up from the\ncracked flagstone of the pavement on which his eyes were fixed.\n\nMarco went forward with military step and stopped opposite to him with\nprompt salute.\n\n\"Sorry to be late, sir,\" he said, as if he had been a private speaking\nto his colonel.\n\n\"It's 'im, Rat! 'E's come, Rat!\" the Squad shouted. \"Look at 'im!\"\n\nBut The Rat would not look, and did not even move.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Marco, with less ceremony than a private would\nhave shown. \"There's no use in my coming here if you don't want me.\"\n\n\"'E's got a grouch on 'cos you're late!\" called out the head of the\nline. \"No doin' nothin' when 'e's got a grouch on.\"\n\n\"I sha'n't try to do anything,\" said Marco, his boy-face setting itself\ninto good stubborn lines. \"That's not what I came here for. I came to\ndrill. I've been with my father. He comes first. I can't join the Squad\nif he doesn't come first. We're not on active service, and we're not in\nbarracks.\"\n\nThen The Rat moved sharply and turned to look at him.\n\n\"I thought you weren't coming at all!\" he snapped and growled at once.\n\"My father said you wouldn't. He said you were a young swell for all\nyour patched clothes. He said your father would think he was a swell,\neven if he was only a penny-a-liner on newspapers, and he wouldn't let\nyou have anything to do with a vagabond and a nuisance. Nobody begged\nyou to join. Your father can go to blazes!\"\n\n\"Don't you speak in that way about my father,\" said Marco, quite\nquietly, \"because I can't knock you down.\"\n\n\"I'll get up and let you!\" began The Rat, immediately white and raging.\n\"I can stand up with two sticks. I'll get up and let you!\"\n\n\"No, you won't,\" said Marco. \"If you want to know what my father said,\nI can tell you. He said I could come as often as I liked--till I found\nout whether we should be friends or not. He says I shall find that out\nfor myself.\"\n\nIt was a strange thing The Rat did. It must always be remembered of him\nthat his wretched father, who had each year sunk lower and lower in the\nunder-world, had been a gentleman once, a man who had been familiar with\ngood manners and had been educated in the customs of good breeding.\nSometimes when he was drunk, and sometimes when he was partly sober,\nhe talked to The Rat of many things the boy would otherwise never have\nheard of. That was why the lad was different from the other vagabonds.\nThis, also, was why he suddenly altered the whole situation by doing\nthis strange and unexpected thing. He utterly changed his expression and\nvoice, fixing his sharp eyes shrewdly on Marco's. It was almost as if he\nwere asking him a conundrum. He knew it would have been one to most boys\nof the class he appeared outwardly to belong to. He would either know\nthe answer or he wouldn't.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" The Rat said.\n\nThat was the conundrum. It was what a gentleman and an officer would\nhave said, if he felt he had been mistaken or rude. He had heard that\nfrom his drunken father.\n\n\"I beg yours--for being late,\" said Marco.\n\nThat was the right answer. It was the one another officer and gentleman\nwould have made. It settled the matter at once, and it settled more than\nwas apparent at the moment. It decided that Marco was one of those who\nknew the things The Rat's father had once known--the things gentlemen do\nand say and think. Not another word was said. It was all right. Marco\nslipped into line with the Squad, and The Rat sat erect with his\nmilitary bearing and began his drill:\n\n\"Squad!\n\n\"'Tention!\n\n\"Number!\n\n\"Slope arms!\n\n\"Form fours!\n\n\"Right!\n\n\"Quick march!\n\n\"Halt!\n\n\"Left turn!\n\n\"Order arms!\n\n\"Stand at ease!\n\n\"Stand easy!\"\n\nThey did it so well that it was quite wonderful when one considered the\nlimited space at their disposal. They had evidently done it often, and\nThe Rat had been not only a smart, but a severe, officer. This morning\nthey repeated the exercise a number of times, and even varied it with\nReview Drill, with which they seemed just as familiar.\n\n\"Where did you learn it?\" The Rat asked, when the arms were stacked\nagain and Marco was sitting by him as he had sat the previous day.\n\n\"From an old soldier. And I like to watch it, as you do.\"\n\n\"If you were a young swell in the Guards, you couldn't be smarter at\nit,\" The Rat said. \"The way you hold yourself! The way you stand! You've\ngot it! Wish I was you! It comes natural to you.\"\n\n\"I've always liked to watch it and try to do it myself. I did when I was\na little fellow,\" answered Marco.\n\n\"I've been trying to kick it into these chaps for more than a year,\"\nsaid The Rat. \"A nice job I had of it! It nearly made me sick at first.\"\n\nThe semicircle in front of him only giggled or laughed outright. The\nmembers of it seemed to take very little offense at his cavalier\ntreatment of them. He had evidently something to give them which was\nentertaining enough to make up for his tyranny and indifference. He\nthrust his hand into one of the pockets of his ragged coat, and drew out\na piece of newspaper.\n\n\"My father brought home this, wrapped round a loaf of bread,\" he said.\n\"See what it says there!\"\n\nHe handed it to Marco, pointing to some words printed in large letters\nat the head of a column. Marco looked at it and sat very still.\n\nThe words he read were: \"The Lost Prince.\"\n\n\"Silence is still the order,\" was the first thought which flashed\nthrough his mind. \"Silence is still the order.\"\n\n\"What does it mean?\" he said aloud.\n\n\"There isn't much of it. I wish there was more,\" The Rat said fretfully.\n\"Read and see. Of course they say it mayn't be true--but I believe it\nis. They say that people think some one knows where he is--at least\nwhere one of his descendants is. It'd be the same thing. He'd be the\nreal king. If he'd just show himself, it might stop all the fighting.\nJust read.\"\n\nMarco read, and his skin prickled as the blood went racing through\nhis body. But his face did not change. There was a sketch of the story\nof the Lost Prince to begin with. It had been regarded by most people,\nthe article said, as a sort of legend. Now there was a definite rumor\nthat it was not a legend at all, but a part of the long past history\nof Samavia. It was said that through the centuries there had always\nbeen a party secretly loyal to the memory of this worshiped and lost\nFedorovitch. It was even said that from father to son, generation after\ngeneration after generation, had descended the oath of fealty to him and\nhis descendants. The people had made a god of him, and now, romantic\nas it seemed, it was beginning to be an open secret that some persons\nbelieved that a descendant had been found--a Fedorovitch worthy of his\nyoung ancestor--and that a certain Secret Party also held that, if he\nwere called back to the throne of Samavia, the interminable wars and\nbloodshed would reach an end.\n\nThe Rat had begun to bite his nails fast.\n\n\"Do you believe he's found?\" he asked feverishly. \"_Don't you_? I do!\"\n\n\"I wonder where he is, if it's true? I wonder! Where?\" exclaimed Marco.\nHe could say that, and he might seem as eager as he felt.\n\nThe Squad all began to jabber at once. \"Yus, where wos'e? There is no\nknowin'. It'd be likely to be in some o' these furrin places. England'd\nbe too far from Samavia. 'Ow far off wos Samavia? Wos it in Roosha, or\nwhere the Frenchies were, or the Germans? But wherever 'e wos, 'e'd be\nthe right sort, an' 'e'd be the sort a chap'd turn and look at in the\nstreet.\"\n\nThe Rat continued to bite his nails.\n\n\"He might be anywhere,\" he said, his small fierce face glowing.\n\n\"That's what I like to think about. He might be passing in the street\noutside there; he might be up in one of those houses,\" jerking his head\nover his shoulder toward the backs of the inclosing dwellings. \"Perhaps\nhe knows he's a king, and perhaps he doesn't. He'd know if what you said\nyesterday was true--about the king always being made ready for Samavia.\"\n\n\"Yes, he'd know,\" put in Marco.\n\n\"Well, it'd be finer if he did,\" went on The Rat. \"However poor and\nshabby he was, he'd know the secret all the time. And if people sneered\nat him, he'd sneer at them and laugh to himself. I dare say he'd walk\ntremendously straight and hold his head up. If I was him, I'd like to\nmake people suspect a bit that I wasn't like the common lot o' them.\"\nHe put out his hand and pushed Marco excitedly. \"Let's work out plots\nfor him!\" he said. \"That'd be a splendid game! Let's pretend we're the\nSecret Party!\"\n\nHe was tremendously excited. Out of the ragged pocket he fished a piece\nof chalk. Then he leaned forward and began to draw something quickly on\nthe flagstones closest to his platform. The Squad leaned forward also,\nquite breathlessly, and Marco leaned forward. The chalk was sketching a\nroughly outlined map, and he knew what map it was, before The Rat spoke.\n\n\"That's a map of Samavia,\" he said. \"It was in that piece of magazine\nI told you about--the one where I read about Prince Ivor. I studied it\nuntil it fell to pieces. But I could draw it myself by that time, so it\ndidn't matter. I could draw it with my eyes shut. That's the capital\ncity,\" pointing to a spot. \"It's called Melzarr. The palace is there.\nIt's the place where the first of the Maranovitch killed the last of\nthe Fedorovitch--the bad chap that was Ivor's father. It's the palace\nIvor wandered out of singing the shepherds' song that early morning.\nIt's where the throne is that his descendant would sit upon to be\ncrowned--that he's _going_ to sit upon. I believe he is! Let's swear\nhe shall!\" He flung down his piece of chalk and sat up. \"Give me two\nsticks. Help me to get up.\"\n\nTwo of the Squad sprang to their feet and came to him. Each snatched one\nof the sticks from the stacked rifles, evidently knowing what he wanted.\nMarco rose too, and watched with sudden, keen curiosity. He had thought\nthat The Rat could not stand up, but it seemed that he could, in a\nfashion of his own, and he was going to do it. The boys lifted him by\nhis arms, set him against the stone coping of the iron railings of the\nchurchyard, and put a stick in each of his hands. They stood at his\nside, but he supported himself.\n\n\"'E could get about if 'e 'ad the money to buy crutches!\" said one\nwhose name was Cad, and he said it quite proudly. The queer thing that\nMarco had noticed was that the ragamuffins were proud of The Rat, and\nregarded him as their lord and master. \"--'E could get about an' stand\nas well as any one,\" added the other, and he said it in the tone of one\nwho boasts. His name was Ben.\n\n\"I'm going to stand now, and so are the rest of you,\" said The Rat.\n\"Squad! 'Tention! You at the head of the line,\" to Marco. They were in\nline in a moment--straight, shoulders back, chins up. And Marco stood at\nthe head.\n\n\"We're going to take an oath,\" said The Rat. \"It's an oath of\nallegiance. Allegiance means faithfulness to a thing--a king or a\ncountry. Ours means allegiance to the King of Samavia. We don't know\nwhere he is, but we swear to be faithful to him, to fight for him, to\nplot for him, to _die_ for him, and to bring him back to his throne!\" The\nway in which he flung up his head when he said the word \"die\" was very\nfine indeed. \"We are the Secret Party. We will work in the dark and find\nout things--and run risks--and collect an army no one will know anything\nabout until it is strong enough to suddenly rise at a secret signal, and\noverwhelm the Maranovitch and Iarovitch, and seize their forts and\ncitadels. No one even knows we are alive. We are a silent, secret thing\nthat never speaks aloud!\"\n\nSilent and secret as they were, however, they spoke aloud at this\njuncture. It was such a grand idea for a game, and so full of possible\nlarks, that the Squad broke into a howl of an exultant cheer.\n\n\"Hooray!\" they yelled. \"Hooray for the oath of 'legiance! 'Ray! 'ray!\n'ray!\"\n\n\"Shut up, you swine!\" shouted The Rat. \"Is that the way you keep\nyourself secret? You'll call the police in, you fools! Look at _him_!\"\npointing to Marco. \"He's got some sense.\"\n\nMarco, in fact, had not made any sound.\n\n\"Come here, you Cad and Ben, and put me back on my wheels,\" raged the\nSquad's commander. \"I'll not make up the game at all. It's no use with a\nlot of fat-head, raw recruits like you.\"\n\nThe line broke and surrounded him in a moment, pleading and urging.\n\n\"Aw, Rat! We forgot. It's the primest game you've ever thought out! Rat!\nRat! Don't get a grouch on! We'll keep still, Rat! Primest lark of all\n'll be the sneakin' about an' keepin' quiet. Aw, Rat! Keep it up!\"\n\n\"Keep it up yourselves!\" snarled The Rat.\n\n\"Not another cove of us could do it but you! Not one! There's no other\ncove could think it out. You're the only chap that can think out things.\nYou thought out the Squad! That's why you're captain!\"\n\nThis was true. He was the one who could invent entertainment for them,\nthese street lads who had nothing. Out of that nothing he could create\nwhat excited them, and give them something to fill empty, useless, often\ncold or wet or foggy, hours. That made him their captain and their\npride.\n\nThe Rat began to yield, though grudgingly. He pointed again to Marco,\nwho had not moved, but stood still at attention.\n\n\"Look at _him_!\" he said. \"He knows enough to stand where he's put until\nhe's ordered to break line. He's a soldier, he is--not a raw recruit\nthat don't know the goose-step. He's been in barracks before.\"\n\nBut after this outburst, he deigned to go on.\n\n\"Here's the oath,\" he said. \"We swear to stand any torture and submit in\nsilence to any death rather than betray our secret and our king. We will\nobey in silence and in secret. We will swim through seas of blood and\nfight our way through lakes of fire, if we are ordered. Nothing shall\nbar our way. All we do and say and think is for our country and our\nking. If any of you have anything to say, speak out before you take the\noath.\"\n\nHe saw Marco move a little, and he made a sign to him.\n\n\"You,\" he said. \"Have you something to say?\"\n\nMarco turned to him and saluted.\n\n\"Here stand ten men for Samavia. God be thanked!\" he said. He dared say\nthat much, and he felt as if his father himself would have told him that\nthey were the right words.\n\nThe Rat thought they were. Somehow he felt that they struck home. He\nreddened with a sudden emotion.\n\n\"Squad!\" he said. \"I'll let you give three cheers on that. It's for the\nlast time. We'll begin to be quiet afterward.\"\n\nAnd to the Squad's exultant relief he led the cheer, and they were\nallowed to make as much uproar as they liked. They liked to make a great\ndeal, and when it was at an end, it had done them good and made them\nready for business.\n\nThe Rat opened the drama at once. Never surely had there ever before\nbeen heard a conspirator's whisper as hollow as his.\n\n\"Secret Ones,\" he said, \"it is midnight. We meet in the depths of\ndarkness. We dare not meet by day. When we meet in the daytime, we\npretend not to know each other. We are meeting now in a Samavian city\nwhere there is a fortress. We shall have to take it when the secret sign\nis given and we make our rising. We are getting everything ready, so\nthat, when we find the king, the secret sign can be given.\"\n\n\"What is the name of the city we are in?\" whispered Cad.\n\n\"It is called Larrina. It is an important seaport. We must take it as\nsoon as we rise. The next time we meet I will bring a dark lantern and\ndraw a map and show it to you.\"\n\nIt would have been a great advantage to the game if Marco could have\ndrawn for them the map he could have made, a map which would have shown\nevery fortress--every stronghold and every weak place. Being a boy, he\nknew what excitement would have thrilled each breast, how they would\nlean forward and pile question on question, pointing to this place and\nto that. He had learned to draw the map before he was ten, and he had\ndrawn it again and again because there had been times when his father\nhad told him that changes had taken place. Oh, yes! he could have drawn\na map which would have moved them to a frenzy of joy. But he sat silent\nand listened, only speaking when he asked a question, as if he knew\nnothing more about Samavia than The Rat did. What a Secret Party they\nwere! They drew themselves together in the closest of circles; they\nspoke in unearthly whispers.\n\n\"A sentinel ought to be posted at the end of the passage,\" Marco\nwhispered.\n\n\"Ben, take your gun!\" commanded The Rat.\n\nBen rose stealthily, and, shouldering his weapon, crept on tiptoe to the\nopening. There he stood on guard.\n\n\"My father says there's been a Secret Party in Samavia for a hundred\nyears,\" The Rat whispered.\n\n\"Who told him?\" asked Marco.\n\n\"A man who has been in Samavia,\" answered The Rat. \"He said it was the\nmost wonderful Secret Party in the world, because it has worked and\nwaited so long, and never given up, though it has had no reason for\nhoping. It began among some shepherds and charcoal-burners who bound\nthemselves by an oath to find the Lost Prince and bring him back to\nthe throne. There were too few of them to do anything against the\nMaranovitch, and when the first lot found they were growing old,\nthey made their sons take the same oath. It has been passed on from\ngeneration to generation, and in each generation the band has grown. No\none really knows how large it is now, but they say that there are people\nin nearly all the countries in Europe who belong to it in dead secret,\nand are sworn to help it when they are called. They are only waiting.\nSome are rich people who will give money, and some are poor ones who\nwill slip across the frontier to fight or to help to smuggle in arms.\nThey even say that for all these years there have been arms made in\ncaves in the mountains, and hidden there year after year. There are men\nwho are called Forgers of the Sword, and they, and their fathers, and\ngrandfathers, and great-grandfathers have always made swords and stored\nthem in caverns no one knows of, hidden caverns underground.\"\n\nMarco spoke aloud the thought which had come into his mind as he\nlistened, a thought which brought fear to him. \"If the people in the\nstreets talk about it, they won't be hidden long.\"\n\n\"It isn't common talk, my father says. Only very few have guessed, and\nmost of them think it is part of the Lost Prince legend,\" said The Rat.\n\"The Maranovitch and Iarovitch laugh at it. They have always been great\nfools. They're too full of their own swagger to think anything can\ninterfere with them.\"\n\n\"Do you talk much to your father?\" Marco asked him.\n\nThe Rat showed his sharp white teeth in a grin.\n\n\"I know what you're thinking of,\" he said. \"You're remembering that I\nsaid he was always drunk. So he is, except when he's only _half_ drunk.\nAnd when he's _half_ drunk, he's the most splendid talker in London. He\nremembers everything he has ever learned or read or heard since he was\nborn. I get him going and listen. He wants to talk and I want to hear.\nI found out almost everything I know in that way. He didn't know he was\nteaching me, but he was. He goes back into being a gentleman when he's\nhalf drunk.\"\n\n\"If--if you care about the Samavians, you'd better ask him not to tell\npeople about the Secret Party and the Forgers of the Sword,\" suggested\nMarco.\n\nThe Rat started a little.\n\n\"That's true!\" he said. \"You're sharper than I am. It oughtn't to be\nblabbed about, or the Maranovitch might hear enough to make them stop\nand listen. I'll get him to promise. There's one queer thing about him,\"\nhe added very slowly, as if he were thinking it over, \"I suppose it's\npart of the gentleman that's left in him. If he makes a promise, he\nnever breaks it, drunk or sober.\"\n\n\"Ask him to make one,\" said Marco. The next moment he changed the\nsubject because it seemed the best thing to do. \"Go on and tell us what\nour own Secret Party is to do. We're forgetting,\" he whispered.\n\nThe Rat took up his game with renewed keenness. It was a game which\nattracted him immensely because it called upon his imagination and held\nhis audience spellbound, besides plunging him into war and strategy.\n\n\"We're preparing for the rising,\" he said. \"It must come soon. We've\nwaited so long. The caverns are stacked with arms. The Maranovitch and\nthe Iarovitch are fighting and using all their soldiers, and now is our\ntime.\" He stopped and thought, his elbows on his knees. He began to bite\nhis nails again.\n\n\"The Secret Signal must be given,\" he said. Then he stopped again, and\nthe Squad held its breath and pressed nearer with a softly shuffling\nsound. \"Two of the Secret Ones must be chosen by lot and sent forth,\" he\nwent on; and the Squad almost brought ruin and disgrace upon itself by\nwanting to cheer again, and only just stopping itself in time. \"Must be\nchosen _by lot_,\" The Rat repeated, looking from one face to another.\n\"Each one will take his life in his hand when he goes forth. He may have\nto die a thousand deaths, but he must go. He must steal in silence and\ndisguise from one country to another. Wherever there is one of the\nSecret Party, whether he is in a hovel or on a throne, the messengers\nmust go to him in darkness and stealth and give him the sign. It will\nmean, 'The hour has come. God save Samavia!'\"\n\n\"God save Samavia!\" whispered the Squad, excitedly. And, because they\nsaw Marco raise his hand to his forehead, every one of them saluted.\n\nThey all began to whisper at once.\n\n\"Let's draw lots now. Let's draw lots, Rat. Don't let's 'ave no\nwaitin'.\"\n\nThe Rat began to look about him with dread anxiety. He seemed to be\nexamining the sky.\n\n\"The darkness is not as thick as it was,\" he whispered. \"Midnight has\npassed. The dawn of day will be upon us. If any one has a piece of paper\nor a string, we will draw the lots before we part.\"\n\nCad had a piece of string, and Marco had a knife which could be used to\ncut it into lengths. This The Rat did himself. Then, after shutting his\neyes and mixing them, he held them in his hand ready for the drawing.\n\n\"The Secret One who draws the longest lot is chosen. The Secret One who\ndraws the shortest is chosen,\" he said solemnly.\n\nThe drawing was as solemn as his tone. Each boy wanted to draw either\nthe shortest lot or the longest one. The heart of each thumped somewhat\nas he drew his piece of string.\n\nWhen the drawing was at an end, each showed his lot. The Rat had drawn\nthe shortest piece of string, and Marco had drawn the longest one.\n\n\"Comrade!\" said The Rat, taking his hand. \"We will face death and danger\ntogether!\"\n\n\"God save Samavia!\" answered Marco.\n\nAnd the game was at an end for the day. The primest thing, the Squad\nsaid, The Rat had ever made up for them. \"'E wos a wonder, he wos!\"\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\"THE LAMP IS LIGHTED!\"\n\n\nOn his way home, Marco thought of nothing but the story he must tell his\nfather, the story the stranger who had been to Samavia had told The\nRat's father. He felt that it must be a true story and not merely an\ninvention. The Forgers of the Sword must be real men, and the hidden\nsubterranean caverns stacked through the centuries with arms must be\nreal, too. And if they were real, surely his father was one of those who\nknew the secret. His thoughts ran very fast. The Rat's boyish invention\nof the rising was only part of a game, but how natural it would be that\nsometime--perhaps before long--there would be a real rising! Surely\nthere would be one if the Secret Party had grown so strong, and if many\nweapons and secret friends in other countries were ready and waiting.\nDuring all these years, hidden work and preparation would have been\ngoing on continually, even though it was preparation for an unknown day.\nA party which had lasted so long--which passed its oath on from\ngeneration to generation--must be of a deadly determination.\n\nWhat might it not have made ready in its caverns and secret\nmeeting-places! He longed to reach home and tell his father, at once,\nall he had heard. He recalled to mind, word for word, all that The Rat\nhad been told, and even all he had added in his game, because--well,\nbecause that seemed so real too, so real that it actually might be\nuseful.\n\nBut when he reached No. 7 Philibert Place, he found Loristan and Lazarus\nvery much absorbed in work. The door of the back sitting-room was locked\nwhen he first knocked on it, and locked again as soon as he had entered.\nThere were many papers on the table, and they were evidently studying\nthem. Several of them were maps. Some were road maps, some maps of towns\nand cities, and some of fortifications; but they were all maps of places\nin Samavia. They were usually kept in a strong box, and when they were\ntaken out to be studied, the door was always kept locked.\n\nBefore they had their evening meal, these were all returned to the\nstrong box, which was pushed into a corner and had newspapers piled upon\nit.\n\n\"When he arrives,\" Marco heard Loristan say to Lazarus, \"we can show him\nclearly what has been planned. He can see for himself.\"\n\nHis father spoke scarcely at all during the meal, and, though it was\nnot the habit of Lazarus to speak at such times unless spoken to, this\nevening it seemed to Marco that he _looked_ more silent than he had\never seen him look before. They were plainly both thinking anxiously of\ndeeply serious things. The story of the stranger who had been to Samavia\nmust not be told yet. But it was one which would keep.\n\nLoristan did not say anything until Lazarus had removed the things from\nthe table and made the room as neat as possible. While that was being\ndone, he sat with his forehead resting on his hand, as if absorbed in\nthought. Then he made a gesture to Marco.\n\n\"Come here, Comrade,\" he said.\n\nMarco went to him.\n\n\"To-night some one may come to talk with me about grave things,\" he\nsaid. \"I think he will come, but I cannot be quite sure. It is important\nthat he should know that, when he comes, he will find me quite alone. He\nwill come at a late hour, and Lazarus will open the door quietly that no\none may hear. It is important that no one should see him. Some one must\ngo and walk on the opposite side of the street until he appears. Then\nthe one who goes to give warning must cross the pavement before him and\nsay in a low voice, 'The Lamp is lighted!' and at once turn quietly\naway.\"\n\nWhat boy's heart would not have leaped with joy at the mystery of it!\nEven a common and dull boy who knew nothing of Samavia would have felt\njerky. Marco's voice almost shook with the thrill of his feeling.\n\n\"How shall I know him?\" he said at once. Without asking at all, he knew\nhe was the \"some one\" who was to go.\n\n\"You have seen him before,\" Loristan answered. \"He is the man who drove\nin the carriage with the King.\"\n\n\"I shall know him,\" said Marco. \"When shall I go?\"\n\n\"Not until it is half-past one o'clock. Go to bed and sleep until\nLazarus calls you.\" Then he added, \"Look well at his face before you\nspeak. He will probably not be dressed as well as he was when you saw\nhim first.\"\n\nMarco went up-stairs to his room and went to bed as he was told, but\nit was hard to go to sleep. The rattle and roaring of the road did not\nusually keep him awake, because he had lived in the poorer quarter of\ntoo many big capital cities not to be accustomed to noise. But to-night\nit seemed to him that, as he lay and looked out at the lamplight, he\nheard every bus and cab which went past. He could not help thinking of\nthe people who were in them, and on top of them, and of the people who\nwere hurrying along on the pavement outside the broken iron railings. He\nwas wondering what they would think if they knew that things connected\nwith the battles they read of in the daily papers were going on in one\nof the shabby houses they scarcely gave a glance to as they went by\nthem. It must be something connected with the war, if a man who was a\ngreat diplomat and the companion of kings came in secret to talk alone\nwith a patriot who was a Samavian. Whatever his father was doing was for\nthe good of Samavia, and perhaps the Secret Party knew he was doing it.\nHis heart almost beat aloud under his shirt as he lay on the lumpy\nmattress thinking it over. He must indeed look well at the stranger\nbefore he even moved toward him. He must be sure he was the right man.\nThe game he had amused himself with so long--the game of trying to\nremember pictures and people and places clearly and in detail--had been\na wonderful training. If he could draw, he knew he could have made a\nsketch of the keen-eyed, clever, aquiline face with the well-cut and\ndelicately close mouth, which looked as if it had been shut upon secrets\nalways--always. If he could draw, he found himself saying again. He\n_could_ draw, though perhaps only roughly. He had often amused himself by\nmaking sketches of things he wanted to ask questions about. He had even\ndrawn people's faces in his untrained way, and his father had said that\nhe had a crude gift for catching a likeness. Perhaps he could make a\nsketch of this face which would show his father that he knew and would\nrecognize it.\n\nHe jumped out of bed and went to a table near the window. There was\npaper and a pencil lying on it. A street lamp exactly opposite threw\ninto the room quite light enough for him to see by. He half knelt by the\ntable and began to draw. He worked for about twenty minutes steadily,\nand he tore up two or three unsatisfactory sketches. The poor drawing\nwould not matter if he could catch that subtle look which was not\nslyness but something more dignified and important. It was not\ndifficult to get the marked, aristocratic outline of the features.\nA common-looking man with less pronounced profile would have been less\neasy to draw in one sense. He gave his mind wholly to the recalling of\nevery detail which had photographed itself on his memory through its\ntrained habit. Gradually he saw that the likeness was becoming clearer.\nIt was not long before it was clear enough to be a striking one. Any one\nwho knew the man would recognize it. He got up, drawing a long and\njoyful breath.\n\nHe did not put on his shoes, but crossed his room as noiselessly as\npossible, and as noiselessly opened the door. He made no ghost of a\nsound when he went down the stairs. The woman who kept the lodging-house\nhad gone to bed, and so had the other lodgers and the maid of all work.\nAll the lights were out except the one he saw a glimmer of under the\ndoor of his father's room. When he had been a mere baby, he had been\ntaught to make a special sign on the door when he wished to speak to\nLoristan. He stood still outside the back sitting-room and made it now.\nIt was a low scratching sound--two scratches and a soft tap. Lazarus\nopened the door and looked troubled.\n\n\"It is not yet time, sir,\" he said very low.\n\n\"I know,\" Marco answered. \"But I must show something to my father.\"\nLazarus let him in, and Loristan turned round from his writing-table\nquestioningly.\n\nMarco went forward and laid the sketch down before him.\n\n\"Look at it,\" he said. \"I remember him well enough to draw that. I\nthought of it all at once--that I could make a sort of picture. Do you\nthink it is like him?\" Loristan examined it closely.\n\n\"It is very like him,\" he answered. \"You have made me feel entirely\nsafe. Thanks, Comrade. It was a good idea.\"\n\nThere was relief in the grip he gave the boy's hand, and Marco turned\naway with an exultant feeling. Just as he reached the door, Loristan\nsaid to him:\n\n\"Make the most of this gift. It is a gift. And it is true your mind has\nhad good training. The more you draw, the better. Draw everything you\ncan.\"\n\nNeither the street lamps, nor the noises, nor his thoughts kept Marco\nawake when he went back to bed. But before he settled himself upon his\npillow he gave himself certain orders. He had both read, and heard\nLoristan say, that the mind can control the body when people once find\nout that it can do so. He had tried experiments himself, and had found\nout some curious things. One was that if he told himself to remember a\ncertain thing at a certain time, he usually found that he _did_ remember\nit. Something in his brain seemed to remind him. He had often tried the\nexperiment of telling himself to awaken at a particular hour, and had\nawakened almost exactly at the moment by the clock.\n\n\"I will sleep until one o'clock,\" he said as he shut his eyes. \"Then I\nwill awaken and feel quite fresh. I shall not be sleepy at all.\"\n\nHe slept as soundly as a boy can sleep. And at one o'clock exactly he\nawakened, and found the street lamp still throwing its light through the\nwindow. He knew it was one o'clock, because there was a cheap little\nround clock on the table, and he could see the time. He was quite fresh\nand not at all sleepy. His experiment had succeeded again.\n\nHe got up and dressed. Then he went down-stairs as noiselessly as\nbefore. He carried his shoes in his hands, as he meant to put them on\nonly when he reached the street. He made his sign at his father's door,\nand it was Loristan who opened it.\n\n\"Shall I go now?\" Marco asked.\n\n\"Yes. Walk slowly to the other side of the street. Look in every\ndirection. We do not know where he will come from. After you have given\nhim the sign, then come in and go to bed again.\"\n\nMarco saluted as a soldier would have done on receiving an order.\n\nThen, without a second's delay, he passed noiselessly out of the house.\n\nLoristan turned back into the room and stood silently in the center of\nit. The long lines of his handsome body looked particularly erect and\nstately, and his eyes were glowing as if something deeply moved him.\n\n\"There grows a man for Samavia,\" he said to Lazarus, who watched him.\n\"God be thanked!\"\n\nLazarus's voice was low and hoarse, and he saluted quite reverently.\n\n\"Your--sir!\" he said. \"God save the Prince!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Loristan answered, after a moment's hesitation,--\"when he is\nfound.\" And he went back to his table smiling his beautiful smile.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe wonder of silence in the deserted streets of a great city, after\nmidnight has hushed all the roar and tumult to rest, is an almost\nunbelievable thing. The stillness in the depths of a forest or on a\nmountain top is not so strange. A few hours ago, the tumult was rushing\npast; in a few hours more, it will be rushing past again.\n\nBut now the street is a naked thing; a distant policeman's tramp on\nthe bare pavement has a hollow and almost fearsome sound. It seemed\nespecially so to Marco as he crossed the road. Had it ever been so empty\nand deadly silent before? Was it so every night? Perhaps it was, when he\nwas fast asleep on his lumpy mattress with the light from a street lamp\nstreaming into the room. He listened for the step of the policeman on\nnight-watch, because he did not wish to be seen. There was a jutting\nwall where he could stand in the shadow while the man passed. A\npoliceman would stop to look questioningly at a boy who walked up and\ndown the pavement at half-past one in the morning. Marco could wait\nuntil he had gone by, and then come out into the light and look up and\ndown the road and the cross streets.\n\nHe heard his approaching footsteps in a few minutes, and was safely in\nthe shadows before he could be seen. When the policeman passed, he came\nout and walked slowly down the road, looking on each side, and now and\nthen looking back. At first no one was in sight. Then a late hansom-cab\ncame tinkling along. But the people in it were returning from some\nfestivity, and were laughing and talking, and noticed nothing but their\nown joking. Then there was silence again, and for a long time, as it\nseemed to Marco, no one was to be seen. It was not really so long as it\nappeared, because he was anxious. Then a very early vegetable-wagon on\nthe way from the country to Covent Garden Market came slowly lumbering\nby with its driver almost asleep on his piles of potatoes and cabbages.\nAfter it had passed, there was stillness and emptiness once more, until\nthe policeman showed himself again on his beat, and Marco slipped into\nthe shadow of the wall as he had done before.\n\nWhen he came out into the light, he had begun to hope that the time\nwould not seem long to his father. It had not really been long, he told\nhimself, it had only seemed so. But his father's anxiousness would be\ngreater than his own could be. Loristan knew all that depended on the\ncoming of this great man who sat side by side with a king in his\ncarriage and talked to him as if he knew him well.\n\n\"It might be something which all Samavia is waiting to know--at least\nall the Secret Party,\" Marco thought. \"The Secret Party is Samavia,\"--he\nstarted at the sound of footsteps. \"Some one is coming!\" he said. \"It is\na man.\"\n\nIt was a man who was walking up the road on the same side of the\npavement as his own. Marco began to walk toward him quietly but rather\nrapidly. He thought it might be best to appear as if he were some boy\nsent on a midnight errand--perhaps to call a doctor. Then, if it was a\nstranger he passed, no suspicion would be aroused. Was this man as tall\nas the one who had driven with the King? Yes, he was about the same\nheight, but he was too far away to be recognizable otherwise. He drew\nnearer, and Marco noticed that he also seemed slightly to hasten his\nfootsteps. Marco went on. A little nearer, and he would be able to make\nsure. Yes, now he was near enough. Yes, this man was the same height and\nnot unlike in figure, but he was much younger. He was not the one who\nhad been in the carriage with His Majesty. He was not more than thirty\nyears old. He began swinging his cane and whistling a music-hall song\nsoftly as Marco passed him without changing his pace.\n\nIt was after the policeman had walked round his beat and disappeared for\nthe third time, that Marco heard footsteps echoing at some distance down\na cross street. After listening to make sure that they were approaching\ninstead of receding in another direction, he placed himself at a point\nwhere he could watch the length of the thoroughfare. Yes, some one was\ncoming. It was a man's figure again. He was able to place himself rather\nin the shadow so that the person approaching would not see that he was\nbeing watched. The solitary walker reached a recognizable distance in\nabout two minutes' time. He was dressed in an ordinary shop-made suit of\nclothes which was rather shabby and quite unnoticeable in its\nappearance. His common hat was worn so that it rather shaded his face.\nBut even before he had crossed to Marco's side of the road, the boy had\nclearly recognized him. It was the man who had driven with the King!\n\nChance was with Marco. The man crossed at exactly the place which made\nit easy for the boy to step lightly from behind him, walk a few paces\nby his side, and then pass directly before him across the pavement,\nglancing quietly up into his face as he said in a low voice but\ndistinctly, the words \"The Lamp is lighted,\" and without pausing a\nsecond walk on his way down the road. He did not slacken his pace or\nlook back until he was some distance away. Then he glanced over his\nshoulder, and saw that the figure had crossed the street and was inside\nthe railings. It was all right. His father would not be disappointed.\nThe great man had come.\n\nHe walked for about ten minutes, and then went home and to bed. But he\nwas obliged to tell himself to go to sleep several times before his eyes\nclosed for the rest of the night.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nAN EXCITING GAME\n\n\nLoristan referred only once during the next day to what had happened.\n\n\"You did your errand well. You were not hurried or nervous,\" he said.\n\"The Prince was pleased with your calmness.\"\n\nNo more was said. Marco knew that the quiet mention of the stranger's\ntitle had been made merely as a designation. If it was necessary to\nmention him again in the future, he could be referred to as \"the\nPrince.\" In various Continental countries there were many princes who\nwere not royal or even serene highnesses--who were merely princes as\nother nobles were dukes or barons. Nothing special was revealed when\na man was spoken of as a prince. But though nothing was said on the\nsubject of the incident, it was plain that much work was being done by\nLoristan and Lazarus. The sitting-room door was locked, and the maps\nand documents, usually kept in the iron box, were being used.\n\nMarco went to the Tower of London and spent part of the day in living\nagain the stories which, centuries past, had been inclosed within its\nmassive and ancient stone walls. In this way, he had throughout boyhood\nbecome intimate with people who to most boys seemed only the unreal\ncreatures who professed to be alive in school-books of history. He had\nlearned to know them as men and women because he had stood in the\npalaces they had been born in and had played in as children, had died in\nat the end. He had seen the dungeons they had been imprisoned in, the\nblocks on which they had laid their heads, the battlements on which they\nhad fought to defend their fortressed towers, the thrones they had sat\nupon, the crowns they had worn, and the jeweled scepters they had held.\nHe had stood before their portraits and had gazed curiously at their\n\"Robes of Investiture,\" sewn with tens of thousands of seed-pearls. To\nlook at a man's face and feel his pictured eyes follow you as you move\naway from him, to see the strangely splendid garments he once warmed\nwith his living flesh, is to realize that history is not a mere lesson\nin a school-book, but is a relation of the life stories of men and women\nwho saw strange and splendid days, and sometimes suffered strange and\nterrible things.\n\nThere were only a few people who were being led about sight-seeing.\nThe man in the ancient Beef-eaters' costume, who was their guide, was\ngood-natured, and evidently fond of talking. He was a big and stout man,\nwith a large face and a small, merry eye. He was rather like pictures of\nHenry the Eighth, himself, which Marco remembered having seen. He was\nspecially talkative when he stood by the tablet that marks the spot\nwhere stood the block on which Lady Jane Grey had laid her young head.\nOne of the sightseers who knew little of English history had asked some\nquestions about the reasons for her execution.\n\n\"If her father-in-law, the Duke of Northumberland, had left that young\ncouple alone--her and her husband, Lord Guildford Dudley--they'd have\nkept their heads on. He was bound to make her a queen, and Mary Tudor\nwas bound to be queen herself. The duke wasn't clever enough to manage a\nconspiracy and work up the people. These Samavians we're reading about\nin the papers would have done it better. And they're half-savages.\"\n\n\"They had a big battle outside Melzarr yesterday,\" the sight-seer\nstanding next to Marco said to the young woman who was his companion.\n\"Thousands of 'em killed. I saw it in big letters on the boards as I\nrode on the top of the bus. They're just slaughtering each other, that's\nwhat they're doing.\"\n\nThe talkative Beef-eater heard him.\n\n\"They can't even bury their dead fast enough,\" he said. \"There'll be\nsome sort of plague breaking out and sweeping into the countries nearest\nthem. It'll end by spreading all over Europe as it did in the Middle\nAges. What the civilized countries have got to do is to make them choose\na decent king and begin to behave themselves.\"\n\n\"I'll tell my father that too,\" Marco thought. \"It shows that everybody\nis thinking and talking of Samavia, and that even the common people know\nit must have a real king. This must be _the time_!\" And what he meant was\nthat this must be the time for which the Secret Party had waited and\nworked so long--the time for the Rising. But his father was out when he\nwent back to Philibert Place, and Lazarus looked more silent than ever\nas he stood behind his chair and waited on him through his insignificant\nmeal. However plain and scant the food they had to eat, it was always\nserved with as much care and ceremony as if it had been a banquet.\n\n\"A man can eat dry bread and drink cold water as if he were a\ngentleman,\" his father had said long ago. \"And it is easy to form\ncareless habits. Even if one is hungry enough to feel ravenous, a man\nwho has been well bred will not allow himself to look so. A dog may, a\nman may not. Just as a dog may howl when he is angry or in pain and a\nman may not.\"\n\nIt was only one of the small parts of the training which had quietly\nmade the boy, even as a child, self-controlled and courteous, had taught\nhim ease and grace of boyish carriage, the habit of holding his body\nwell and his head erect, and had given him a certain look of young\ndistinction which, though it assumed nothing, set him apart from boys of\ncarelessly awkward bearing.\n\n\"Is there a newspaper here which tells of the battle, Lazarus?\" he\nasked, after he had left the table.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" was the answer. \"Your father said that you might read it. It\nis a black tale!\" he added, as he handed him the paper.\n\nIt was a black tale. As he read, Marco felt as if he could scarcely bear\nit. It was as if Samavia swam in blood, and as if the other countries\nmust stand aghast before such furious cruelties.\n\n\"Lazarus,\" he said, springing to his feet at last, his eyes burning,\n\"something must stop it! There must be something strong enough. The time\nhas come. The time has come.\" And he walked up and down the room because\nhe was too excited to stand still.\n\nHow Lazarus watched him! What a strong and glowing feeling there was in\nhis own restrained face!\n\n\"Yes, sir. Surely the time has come,\" he answered. But that was all he\nsaid, and he turned and went out of the shabby back sitting-room at\nonce. It was as if he felt it were wiser to go before he lost power over\nhimself and said more.\n\nMarco made his way to the meeting-place of the Squad, to which The Rat\nhad in the past given the name of the Barracks. The Rat was sitting\namong his followers, and he had been reading the morning paper to them,\nthe one which contained the account of the battle of Melzarr. The Squad\nhad become the Secret Party, and each member of it was thrilled with the\nspirit of dark plot and adventure. They all whispered when they spoke.\n\n\"This is not the Barracks now,\" The Rat said. \"It is a subterranean\ncavern. Under the floor of it thousands of swords and guns are buried,\nand it is piled to the roof with them. There is only a small place left\nfor us to sit and plot in. We crawl in through a hole, and the hole is\nhidden by bushes.\"\n\nTo the rest of the boys this was only an exciting game, but Marco\nknew that to The Rat it was more. Though The Rat knew none of the\nthings he knew, he saw that the whole story seemed to him a real thing.\nThe struggles of Samavia, as he had heard and read of them in the\nnewspapers, had taken possession of him. His passion for soldiering and\nwarfare and his curiously mature brain had led him into following every\ndetail he could lay hold of. He had listened to all he had heard with\nremarkable results. He remembered things older people forgot after they\nhad mentioned them. He forgot nothing. He had drawn on the flagstones a\nmap of Samavia which Marco saw was actually correct, and he had made a\nrough sketch of Melzarr and the battle which had had such disastrous\nresults.\n\n\"The Maranovitch had possession of Melzarr,\" he explained with feverish\neagerness. \"And the Iarovitch attacked them from here,\" pointing with\nhis finger. \"That was a mistake. I should have attacked them from a\nplace where they would not have been expecting it. They expected attack\non their fortifications, and they were ready to defend them. I believe\nthe enemy could have stolen up in the night and rushed in here,\"\npointing again. Marco thought he was right. The Rat had argued it all\nout, and had studied Melzarr as he might have studied a puzzle or an\narithmetical problem. He was very clever, and as sharp as his queer face\nlooked.\n\n\"I believe you would make a good general if you were grown up,\" said\nMarco. \"I'd like to show your maps to my father and ask him if he\ndoesn't think your stratagem would have been a good one.\"\n\n\"Does he know much about Samavia?\" asked The Rat.\n\n\"He has to read the newspapers because he writes things,\" Marco\nanswered. \"And every one is thinking about the war. No one can help it.\"\n\nThe Rat drew a dingy, folded paper out of his pocket and looked it over\nwith an air of reflection.\n\n\"I'll make a clean one,\" he said. \"I'd like a grown-up man to look at it\nand see if it's all right. My father was more than half-drunk when I\nwas drawing this, so I couldn't ask him questions. He'll kill himself\nbefore long. He had a sort of fit last night.\"\n\n\"Tell us, Rat, wot you an' Marco'll 'ave ter do. Let's 'ear wot you've\nmade up,\" suggested Cad. He drew closer, and so did the rest of the\ncircle, hugging their knees with their arms.\n\n\"This is what we shall have to do,\" began The Rat, in the hollow whisper\nof a Secret Party. \"_The hour has come_. To all the Secret Ones in\nSamavia, and to the friends of the Secret Party in every country, the\nsign must be carried. It must be carried by some one who could not be\nsuspected. Who would suspect two boys--and one of them a cripple? The\nbest thing of all for us is that I am a cripple. Who would suspect a\ncripple? When my father is drunk and beats me, he does it because I\nwon't go out and beg in the streets and bring him the money I get. He\nsays that people will nearly always give money to a cripple. I won't be\na beggar for him--the swine--but I will be one for Samavia and the Lost\nPrince. Marco shall pretend to be my brother and take care of me. I\nsay,\" speaking to Marco with a sudden change of voice, \"can you sing\nanything? It doesn't matter how you do it.\"\n\n\"Yes, I can sing,\" Marco replied.\n\n\"Then Marco will pretend he is singing to make people give him money.\nI'll get a pair of crutches somewhere, and part of the time I will go on\ncrutches and part of the time on my platform. We'll live like beggars\nand go wherever we want to. I can whiz past a man and give the sign and\nno one will know. Some times Marco can give it when people are dropping\nmoney into his cap. We can pass from one country to another and rouse\neverybody who is of the Secret Party. We'll work our way into Samavia,\nand we'll be only two boys--and one a cripple--and nobody will think we\ncould be doing anything. We'll beg in great cities and on the highroad.\"\n\n\"Where'll you get the money to travel?\" said Cad.\n\n\"The Secret Party will give it to us, and we sha'n't need much. We could\nbeg enough, for that matter. We'll sleep under the stars, or under\nbridges, or archways, or in dark corners of streets. I've done it myself\nmany a time when my father drove me out of doors. If it's cold weather,\nit's bad enough but if it's fine weather, it's better than sleeping in\nthe kind of place I'm used to. Comrade,\" to Marco, \"are you ready?\"\n\nHe said \"Comrade\" as Loristan did, and somehow Marco did not resent it,\nbecause he was ready to labor for Samavia. It was only a game, but it\nmade them comrades--and was it really only a game, after all? His\nexcited voice and his strange, lined face made it singularly unlike one.\n\n\"Yes, Comrade, I am ready,\" Marco answered him.\n\n\"We shall be in Samavia when the fighting for the Lost Prince begins.\"\nThe Rat carried on his story with fire. \"We may see a battle. We might\ndo something to help. We might carry messages under a rain of bullets--a\nrain of bullets!\" The thought so elated him that he forgot his whisper\nand his voice rang out fiercely. \"Boys have been in battles before. We\nmight find the Lost King--no, the Found King--and ask him to let us be\nhis servants. He could send us where he couldn't send bigger people. I\ncould say to him, 'Your Majesty, I am called \"The Rat,\" because I can\ncreep through holes and into corners and dart about. Order me into any\ndanger and I will obey you. Let me die like a soldier if I can't live\nlike one.'\"\n\nSuddenly he threw his ragged coat sleeve up across his eyes. He had\nwrought himself up tremendously with the picture of the rain of bullets.\nAnd he felt as if he saw the King who had at last been found. The next\nmoment he uncovered his face.\n\n\"That's what we've got to do,\" he said. \"Just that, if you want to know.\nAnd a lot more. There's no end to it!\"\n\nMarco's thoughts were in a whirl. It ought not to be nothing but\na game. He grew quite hot all over. If the Secret Party wanted to\nsend messengers no one would think of suspecting, who could be more\nharmless-looking than two vagabond boys wandering about picking up their\nliving as best they could, not seeming to belong to any one? And one a\ncripple. It was true--yes, it was true, as The Rat said, that his being\na cripple made him look safer than any one else. Marco actually put his\nforehead in his hands and pressed his temples.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" exclaimed The Rat. \"What are you thinking about?\"\n\n\"I'm thinking what a general you would make. I'm thinking that it might\nall be real--every word of it. It mightn't be a game at all,\" said\nMarco.\n\n\"No, it mightn't,\" The Rat answered. \"If I knew where the Secret Party\nwas, I'd like to go and tell them about it. What's that!\" he said,\nsuddenly turning his head toward the street. \"What are they calling\nout?\"\n\nSome newsboy with a particularly shrill voice was shouting out something\nat the topmost of his lungs.\n\nTense and excited, no member of the circle stirred or spoke for a few\nseconds. The Rat listened, Marco listened, the whole Squad listened,\npricking up their ears.\n\n\"Startling news from Samavia,\" the newsboy was shrilling out. \"Amazing\nstory! Descendant of the Lost Prince found! Descendant of the Lost\nPrince found!\"\n\n\"Any chap got a penny?\" snapped The Rat, beginning to shuffle toward the\narched passage.\n\n\"I have!\" answered Marco, following him.\n\n\"Come on!\" The Rat yelled. \"Let's go and get a paper!\" And he whizzed\ndown the passage with his swiftest rat-like dart, while the Squad\nfollowed him, shouting and tumbling over each other.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\"IT IS NOT A GAME\"\n\n\nLoristan walked slowly up and down the back sitting-room and listened to\nMarco, who sat by the small fire and talked.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said, whenever the boy stopped. \"I want to hear it all. He's\na strange lad, and it's a splendid game.\"\n\nMarco was telling him the story of his second and third visits to the\ninclosure behind the deserted church-yard. He had begun at the\nbeginning, and his father had listened with a deep interest.\n\nA year later, Marco recalled this evening as a thrilling memory, and as\none which would never pass away from him throughout his life. He would\nalways be able to call it all back. The small and dingy back room, the\ndimness of the one poor gas-burner, which was all they could afford to\nlight, the iron box pushed into the corner with its maps and plans\nlocked safely in it, the erect bearing and actual beauty of the tall\nform, which the shabbiness of worn and mended clothes could not hide or\ndim. Not even rags and tatters could have made Loristan seem\ninsignificant or undistinguished. He was always the same. His eyes\nseemed darker and more wonderful than ever in their remote\nthoughtfulness and interest as he spoke.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said. \"It is a splendid game. And it is curious. He has\nthought it out well. The lad is a born soldier.\"\n\n\"It is not a game to him,\" Marco said. \"And it is not a game to me. The\nSquad is only playing, but with him it's quite different. He knows he'll\nnever really get what he wants, but he feels as if this was something\nnear it. He said I might show you the map he made. Father, look at it.\"\n\nHe gave Loristan the clean copy of The Rat's map of Samavia. The city of\nMelzarr was marked with certain signs. They were to show at what points\nThe Rat--if he had been a Samavian general--would have attacked the\ncapital. As Marco pointed them out, he explained The Rat's reasons for\nhis planning.\n\nLoristan held the paper for some minutes. He fixed his eyes on it\ncuriously, and his black brows drew themselves together.\n\n\"This is very wonderful!\" he said at last. \"He is quite right. They\nmight have got in there, and for the very reasons he hit on. How did he\nlearn all this?\"\n\n\"He thinks of nothing else now,\" answered Marco. \"He has always thought\nof wars and made plans for battles. He's not like the rest of the Squad.\nHis father is nearly always drunk, but he is very well educated, and,\nwhen he is only half drunk, he likes to talk. The Rat asks him questions\nthen, and leads him on until he finds out a great deal. Then he begs old\nnewspapers, and he hides himself in corners and listens to what people\nare saying. He says he lies awake at night thinking it out, and he\nthinks about it all the day. That was why he got up the Squad.\"\n\nLoristan had continued examining the paper.\n\n\"Tell him,\" he said, when he refolded and handed it back, \"that I\nstudied his map, and he may be proud of it. You may also tell him--\" and\nhe smiled quietly as he spoke--\"that in my opinion he is right. The\nIarovitch would have held Melzarr to-day if he had led them.\"\n\nMarco was full of exultation.\n\n\"I thought you would say he was right. I felt sure you would. That is\nwhat makes me want to tell you the rest,\" he hurried on.\n\n\"If you think he is right about the rest too--\" He stopped awkwardly\nbecause of a sudden wild thought which rushed upon him. \"I don't know\nwhat you will think,\" he stammered. \"Perhaps it will seem to you as if\nthe game--as if that part of it could--could only be a game.\"\n\nHe was so fervent in spite of his hesitation that Loristan began to\nwatch him with sympathetic respect, as he always did when the boy was\ntrying to express something he was not sure of. One of the great bonds\nbetween them was that Loristan was always interested in his boyish\nmental processes--in the way in which his thoughts led him to any\nconclusion.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said again. \"I am like The Rat and I am like you. It has not\nseemed quite like a game to me, so far.\"\n\nHe sat down at the writing-table and Marco, in his eagerness, drew\nnearer and leaned against it, resting on his arms and lowering his\nvoice, though it was always their habit to speak at such a pitch that no\none outside the room they were in could distinguish what they said.\n\n\"It is The Rat's plan for giving the signal for a Rising,\" he said.\n\nLoristan made a slight movement.\n\n\"Does he think there will be a Rising?\" he asked.\n\n\"He says that must be what the Secret Party has been preparing for all\nthese years. And it must come soon. The other nations see that the\nfighting must be put an end to even if they have to stop it themselves.\nAnd if the real King is found--but when The Rat bought the newspaper\nthere was nothing in it about where he was. It was only a sort of rumor.\nNobody seemed to know anything.\" He stopped a few seconds, but he did\nnot utter the words which were in his mind. He did not say: \"But _you_\nknow.\"\n\n\"And The Rat has a plan for giving the signal?\" Loristan said.\n\nMarco forgot his first feeling of hesitation. He began to see the plan\nagain as he had seen it when The Rat talked. He began to speak as The\nRat had spoken, forgetting that it was a game. He made even a clearer\npicture than The Rat had made of the two vagabond boys--one of them\na cripple--making their way from one place to another, quite free\nto carry messages or warnings where they chose, because they were so\ninsignificant and poor-looking that no one could think of them as\nanything but waifs and strays, belonging to nobody and blown about by\nthe wind of poverty and chance. He felt as if he wanted to convince his\nfather that the plan was a possible one. He did not quite know why he\nfelt so anxious to win his approval of the scheme--as if it were\nreal--as if it could actually be done. But this feeling was what\ninspired him to enter into new details and suggest possibilities.\n\n\"A boy who was a cripple and one who was only a street singer and a sort\nof beggar could get almost anywhere,\" he said. \"Soldiers would listen to\na singer if he sang good songs--and they might not be afraid to talk\nbefore him. A strolling singer and a cripple would perhaps hear a great\nmany things it might be useful for the Secret Party to know. They might\neven hear important things. Don't you think so?\"\n\nBefore he had gone far with his story, the faraway look had fallen upon\nLoristan's face--the look Marco had known so well all his life. He sat\nturned a little sidewise from the boy, his elbow resting on the table\nand his forehead on his hand. He looked down at the worn carpet at his\nfeet, and so he looked as he listened to the end. It was as if some new\nthought were slowly growing in his mind as Marco went on talking and\nenlarging on The Rat's plan. He did not even look up or change his\nposition as he answered, \"Yes. I think so.\"\n\nBut, because of the deep and growing thought in his face, Marco's\ncourage increased. His first fear that this part of the planning might\nseem so bold and reckless that it would only appear to belong to a\nboyish game, gradually faded away for some strange reason. His father\nhad said that the first part of The Rat's imaginings had not seemed\nquite like a game to him, and now--even now--he was not listening as if\nhe were listening to the details of mere exaggerated fancies. It was as\nif the thing he was hearing was not wildly impossible. Marco's knowledge\nof Continental countries and of methods of journeying helped him to\nenter into much detail and give realism to his plans.\n\n\"Sometimes we could pretend we knew nothing but English,\" he said.\n\"Then, though The Rat could not understand, I could. I should always\nunderstand in each country. I know the cities and the places we should\nwant to go to. I know how boys like us live, and so we should not do\nanything which would make the police angry or make people notice us.\nIf any one asked questions, I would let them believe that I had met The\nRat by chance, and we had made up our minds to travel together because\npeople gave more money to a boy who sang if he was with a cripple. There\nwas a boy who used to play the guitar in the streets of Rome, and he\nalways had a lame girl with him, and every one knew it was for that\nreason. When he played, people looked at the girl and were sorry for her\nand gave her soldi. You remember.\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember. And what you say is true,\" Loristan answered.\n\nMarco leaned forward across the table so that he came closer to him.\nThe tone in which the words were said made his courage leap like a\nflame. To be allowed to go on with this boldness was to feel that he was\nbeing treated almost as if he were a man. If his father had wished to\nstop him, he could have done it with one quiet glance, without uttering\na word. For some wonderful reason he did not wish him to cease talking.\nHe was willing to hear what he had to say--he was even interested.\n\n\"You are growing older,\" he had said the night he had revealed the\nmarvelous secret. \"Silence is still the order, but you are man enough to\nbe told more.\"\n\nWas he man enough to be thought worthy to help Samavia in any small\nway--even with boyish fancies which might contain a germ of some thought\nwhich older and wiser minds might make useful? Was he being listened to\nbecause the plan, made as part of a game, was not an impossible one--if\ntwo boys who could be trusted could be found? He caught a deep breath as\nhe went on, drawing still nearer and speaking so low that his tone was\nalmost a whisper.\n\n\"If the men of the Secret Party have been working and thinking for\nso many years--they have prepared everything. They know by this time\nexactly what must be done by the messengers who are to give the signal.\nThey can tell them where to go and how to know the secret friends who\nmust be warned. If the orders could be written and given to--to some one\nwho has--who has learned to remember things!\" He had begun to breathe so\nquickly that he stopped for a moment.\n\nLoristan looked up. He looked directly into his eyes.\n\n\"Some one who has been _trained_ to remember things?\" he said.\n\n\"Some one who has been trained,\" Marco went on, catching his breath\nagain. \"Some one who does not forget--who would never forget--never!\nThat one, even if he were only twelve--even if he were only ten--could\ngo and do as he was told.\"\n\nLoristan put his hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Comrade,\" he said, \"you are speaking as if you were ready to go\nyourself.\"\n\nMarco's eyes looked bravely straight into his, but he said not one word.\n\n\"Do you know what it would mean, Comrade?\" his father went on. \"You are\nright. It is not a game. And you are not thinking of it as one. But have\nyou thought how it would be if something betrayed you--and you were set\nup against a wall to be _shot_?\"\n\nMarco stood up quite straight. He tried to believe he felt the wall\nagainst his back.\n\n\"If I were shot, I should be shot for Samavia,\" he said. \"And for _you_,\nFather.\"\n\nEven as he was speaking, the front door-bell rang and Lazarus evidently\nopened it. He spoke to some one, and then they heard his footsteps\napproaching the back sitting-room.\n\n\"Open the door,\" said Loristan, and Marco opened it.\n\n\"There is a boy who is a cripple here, sir,\" the old soldier said. \"He\nasked to see Master Marco.\"\n\n\"If it is The Rat,\" said Loristan, \"bring him in here. I wish to see\nhim.\"\n\nMarco went down the passage to the front door. The Rat was there, but he\nwas not upon his platform. He was leaning upon an old pair of crutches,\nand Marco thought he looked wild and strange. He was white, and somehow\nthe lines of his face seemed twisted in a new way. Marco wondered if\nsomething had frightened him, or if he felt ill.\n\n\"Rat,\" he began, \"my father--\"\n\n\"I've come to tell you about _my_ father,\" The Rat broke in without\nwaiting to hear the rest, and his voice was as strange as his pale face.\n\"I don't know why I've come, but I--I just wanted to. He's dead!\"\n\n\"Your father?\" Marco stammered. \"He's--\"\n\n\"He's dead,\" The Rat answered shakily. \"I told you he'd kill himself.\nHe had another fit and he died in it. I knew he would, one of these days.\nI told him so. He knew he would himself. I stayed with him till he was\ndead--and then I got a bursting headache and I felt sick--and I thought\nabout you.\"\n\nMarco made a jump at him because he saw he was suddenly shaking as if he\nwere going to fall. He was just in time, and Lazarus, who had been\nlooking on from the back of the passage, came forward. Together they\nheld him up.\n\n\"I'm not going to faint,\" he said weakly, \"but I felt as if I was. It\nwas a bad fit, and I had to try and hold him. I was all by myself. The\npeople in the other attic thought he was only drunk, and they wouldn't\ncome in. He's lying on the floor there, dead.\"\n\n\"Come and see my father,\" Marco said. \"He'll tell us what do do.\nLazarus, help him.\"\n\n\"I can get on by myself,\" said The Rat. \"Do you see my crutches? I did\nsomething for a pawnbroker last night, and he gave them to me for pay.\"\n\nBut though he tried to speak carelessly, he had plainly been horribly\nshaken and overwrought. His queer face was yellowish white still, and he\nwas trembling a little.\n\nMarco led the way into the back sitting-room. In the midst of its shabby\ngloom and under the dim light Loristan was standing in one of his still,\nattentive attitudes. He was waiting for them.\n\n\"Father, this is The Rat,\" the boy began. The Rat stopped short and\nrested on his crutches, staring at the tall, reposeful figure with\nwidened eyes.\n\n\"Is that your father?\" he said to Marco. And then added, with a jerky\nhalf-laugh, \"He's not much like mine, is he?\"\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nTHE RAT--AND SAMAVIA\n\n\nWhat The Rat thought when Loristan began to speak to him, Marco\nwondered. Suddenly he stood in an unknown world, and it was Loristan who\nmade it so because its poverty and shabbiness had no power to touch him.\nHe looked at the boy with calm and clear eyes, he asked him practical\nquestions gently, and it was plain that he understood many things\nwithout asking questions at all. Marco thought that perhaps he had, at\nsome time, seen drunken men die, in his life in strange places. He\nseemed to know the terribleness of the night through which The Rat had\npassed. He made him sit down, and he ordered Lazarus to bring him some\nhot coffee and simple food.\n\n\"Haven't had a bite since yesterday,\" The Rat said, still staring at\nhim. \"How did you know I hadn't?\"\n\n\"You have not had time,\" Loristan answered.\n\nAfterward he made him lie down on the sofa.\n\n\"Look at my clothes,\" said The Rat.\n\n\"Lie down and sleep,\" Loristan replied, putting his hand on his shoulder\nand gently forcing him toward the sofa. \"You will sleep a long time. You\nmust tell me how to find the place where your father died, and I will\nsee that the proper authorities are notified.\"\n\n\"What are you doing it for?\" The Rat asked, and then he added, \"sir.\"\n\n\"Because I am a man and you are a boy. And this is a terrible thing,\"\nLoristan answered him.\n\nHe went away without saying more, and The Rat lay on the sofa staring at\nthe wall and thinking about it until he fell asleep. But, before this\nhappened, Marco had quietly left him alone. So, as Loristan had told him\nhe would, he slept deeply and long; in fact, he slept through all the\nnight.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen he awakened it was morning, and Lazarus was standing by the side of\nthe sofa looking down at him.\n\n\"You will want to make yourself clean,\" he said. \"It must be done.\"\n\n\"Clean!\" said The Rat, with his squeaky laugh. \"I couldn't keep clean\nwhen I had a room to live in, and now where am I to wash myself?\" He sat\nup and looked about him.\n\n\"Give me my crutches,\" he said. \"I've got to go. They've let me sleep\nhere all night. They didn't turn me into the street. I don't know why\nthey didn't. Marco's father--he's the right sort. He looks like a\nswell.\"\n\n\"The Master,\" said Lazarus, with a rigid manner, \"the Master is a great\ngentleman. He would turn no tired creature into the street. He and his\nson are poor, but they are of those who give. He desires to see and talk\nto you again. You are to have bread and coffee with him and the young\nMaster. But it is I who tell you that you cannot sit at table with them\nuntil you are clean. Come with me,\" and he handed him his crutches.\nHis manner was authoritative, but it was the manner of a soldier; his\nsomewhat stiff and erect movements were those of a soldier, also, and\nThe Rat liked them because they made him feel as if he were in barracks.\nHe did not know what was going to happen, but he got up and followed him\non his crutches.\n\nLazarus took him to a closet under the stairs where a battered tin bath\nwas already full of hot water, which the old soldier himself had brought\nin pails. There were soap and coarse, clean towels on a wooden chair,\nand also there was a much worn but clean suit of clothes.\n\n\"Put these on when you have bathed,\" Lazarus ordered, pointing to them.\n\"They belong to the young Master and will be large for you, but they\nwill be better than your own.\" And then he went out of the closet and\nshut the door.\n\nIt was a new experience for The Rat. So long as he remembered, he had\nwashed his face and hands--when he had washed them at all--at an iron\ntap set in the wall of a back street or court in some slum. His father\nand himself had long ago sunk into the world where to wash one's self is\nnot a part of every-day life. They had lived amid dirt and foulness, and\nwhen his father had been in a maudlin state, he had sometimes cried and\ntalked of the long-past days when he had shaved every morning and put on\na clean shirt.\n\nTo stand even in the most battered of tin baths full of clean hot water\nand to splash and scrub with a big piece of flannel and plenty of soap\nwas a marvelous thing. The Rat's tired body responded to the novelty\nwith a curious feeling of freshness and comfort.\n\n\"I dare say swells do this every day,\" he muttered. \"I'd do it myself if\nI was a swell. Soldiers have to keep themselves so clean they shine.\"\n\nWhen, after making the most of his soap and water, he came out of the\ncloset under the stairs, he was as fresh as Marco himself; and, though\nhis clothes had been built for a more stalwart body, his recognition of\ntheir cleanliness filled him with pleasure. He wondered if by any effort\nhe could keep himself clean when he went out into the world again and\nhad to sleep in any hole the police did not order him out of.\n\nHe wanted to see Marco again, but he wanted more to see the tall man\nwith the soft dark eyes and that queer look of being a swell in spite of\nhis shabby clothes and the dingy place he lived in. There was something\nabout him which made you keep on looking at him, and wanting to know\nwhat he was thinking of, and why you felt as if you'd take orders from\nhim as you'd take orders from your general, if you were a soldier. He\nlooked, somehow, like a soldier, but as if he were something more--as\nif people had taken orders from him all his life, and always would take\norders from him. And yet he had that quiet voice and those fine, easy\nmovements, and he was not a soldier at all, but only a poor man who\nwrote things for papers which did not pay him well enough to give him\nand his son a comfortable living. Through all the time of his seclusion\nwith the battered bath and the soap and water, The Rat thought of him,\nand longed to have another look at him and hear him speak again. He did\nnot see any reason why he should have let him sleep on his sofa or why\nhe should give him a breakfast before he turned him out to face the\nworld. It was first-rate of him to do it. The Rat felt that when he was\nturned out, after he had had the coffee, he should want to hang about\nthe neighborhood just on the chance of seeing him pass by sometimes. He\ndid not know what he was going to do. The parish officials would by this\ntime have taken his dead father, and he would not see him again. He did\nnot want to see him again. He had never seemed like a father. They had\nnever cared anything for each other. He had only been a wretched outcast\nwhose best hours had been when he had drunk too much to be violent and\nbrutal. Perhaps, The Rat thought, he would be driven to going about on\nhis platform on the pavements and begging, as his father had tried to\nforce him to do. Could he sell newspapers? What could a crippled lad do\nunless he begged or sold papers?\n\nLazarus was waiting for him in the passage. The Rat held back a little.\n\n\"Perhaps they'd rather not eat their breakfast with me,\" he hesitated.\n\"I'm not--I'm not the kind they are. I could swallow the coffee out here\nand carry the bread away with me. And you could thank him for me. I'd\nwant him to know I thanked him.\"\n\nLazarus also had a steady eye. The Rat realized that he was looking him\nover as if he were summing him up.\n\n\"You may not be the kind they are, but you may be of a kind the Master\nsees good in. If he did not see something, he would not ask you to sit\nat his table. You are to come with me.\"\n\nThe Squad had seen good in The Rat, but no one else had. Policemen had\nmoved him on whenever they set eyes on him, the wretched women of the\nslums had regarded him as they regarded his darting, thieving namesake;\nloafing or busy men had seen in him a young nuisance to be kicked or\npushed out of the way. The Squad had not called \"good\" what they saw in\nhim. They would have yelled with laughter if they had heard any one else\ncall it so. \"Goodness\" was not considered an attraction in their world.\n\nThe Rat grinned a little and wondered what was meant, as he followed\nLazarus into the back sitting-room.\n\nIt was as dingy and gloomy as it had looked the night before, but by\nthe daylight The Rat saw how rigidly neat it was, how well swept and\nfree from any speck of dust, how the poor windows had been cleaned and\npolished, and how everything was set in order. The coarse linen cloth on\nthe table was fresh and spotless, so was the cheap crockery, the spoons\nshone with brightness.\n\nLoristan was standing on the hearth and Marco was near him. They were\nwaiting for their vagabond guest as if he had been a gentleman.\n\nThe Rat hesitated and shuffled at the door for a moment, and then it\nsuddenly occurred to him to stand as straight as he could and salute.\nWhen he found himself in the presence of Loristan, he felt as if he\nought to do something, but he did not know what.\n\nLoristan's recognition of his gesture and his expression as he moved\nforward lifted from The Rat's shoulders a load which he himself had not\nknown lay there. Somehow he felt as if something new had happened to\nhim, as if he were not mere \"vermin,\" after all, as if he need not be\non the defensive--even as if he need not feel so much in the dark, and\nlike a thing there was no place in the world for. The mere straight and\nfar-seeing look of this man's eyes seemed to make a place somewhere for\nwhat he looked at. And yet what he said was quite simple.\n\n\"This is well,\" he said. \"You have rested. We will have some food, and\nthen we will talk together.\" He made a slight gesture in the direction\nof the chair at the right hand of his own place.\n\nThe Rat hesitated again. What a swell he was! With that wave of the hand\nhe made you feel as if you were a fellow like himself, and he was doing\nyou some honor.\n\n\"I'm not--\" The Rat broke off and jerked his head toward Marco. \"He\nknows--\" he ended, \"I've never sat at a table like this before.\"\n\n\"There is not much on it.\" Loristan made the slight gesture toward the\nright-hand seat again and smiled. \"Let us sit down.\"\n\nThe Rat obeyed him and the meal began. There were only bread and coffee\nand a little butter before them. But Lazarus presented the cups and\nplates on a small japanned tray as if it were a golden salver. When he\nwas not serving, he stood upright behind his master's chair, as though\nhe wore royal livery of scarlet and gold. To the boy who had gnawed a\nbone or munched a crust wheresoever he found them, and with no thought\nbut of the appeasing of his own wolfish hunger, to watch the two with\nwhom he sat eat their simple food was a new thing. He knew nothing of\nthe every-day decencies of civilized people. The Rat liked to look at\nthem, and he found himself trying to hold his cup as Loristan did, and\nto sit and move as Marco was sitting and moving--taking his bread or\nbutter, when it was held at his side by Lazarus, as if it were a simple\nthing to be waited upon. Marco had had things handed to him all his\nlife, and it did not make him feel awkward. The Rat knew that his own\nfather had once lived like this. He himself would have been at ease if\nchance had treated him fairly. It made him scowl to think of it. But\nin a few minutes Loristan began to talk about the copy of the map of\nSamavia. Then The Rat forgot everything else and was ill at ease no\nmore. He did not know that Loristan was leading him on to explain his\ntheories about the country and the people and the war. He found himself\ntelling all that he had read, or overheard, or _thought_ as he lay awake\nin his garret. He had thought out a great many things in a way not at\nall like a boy's. His strangely concentrated and over-mature mind had\nbeen full of military schemes which Loristan listened to with curiosity\nand also with amazement. He had become extraordinarily clever in one\ndirection because he had fixed all his mental powers on one thing. It\nseemed scarcely natural that an untaught vagabond lad should know so\nmuch and reason so clearly. It was at least extraordinarily interesting.\nThere had been no skirmish, no attack, no battle which he had not led\nand fought in his own imagination, and he had made scores of rough queer\nplans of all that had been or should have been done. Lazarus listened as\nattentively as his master, and once Marco saw him exchange a startled,\nrapid glance with Loristan. It was at a moment when The Rat was\nsketching with his finger on the cloth an attack which _ought_ to have\nbeen made but was not. And Marco knew at once that the quickly exchanged\nlook meant \"He is right! If it had been done, there would have been\nvictory instead of disaster!\"\n\nIt was a wonderful meal, though it was only of bread and coffee. The Rat\nknew he should never be able to forget it.\n\nAfterward, Loristan told him of what he had done the night before. He\nhad seen the parish authorities and all had been done which a city\ngovernment provides in the case of a pauper's death.\n\nHis father would be buried in the usual manner. \"We will follow him,\"\nLoristan said in the end. \"You and I and Marco and Lazarus.\"\n\nThe Rat's mouth fell open.\n\n\"You--and Marco--and Lazarus!\" he exclaimed, staring. \"And me! Why\nshould any of us go? I don't want to. He wouldn't have followed me if\nI'd been the one.\"\n\nLoristan remained silent for a few moments.\n\n\"When a life has counted for nothing, the end of it is a lonely thing,\"\nhe said at last. \"If it has forgotten all respect for itself, pity is\nall that one has left to give. One would like to give _something_ to\nanything so lonely.\" He said the last brief sentence after a pause.\n\n\"Let us go,\" Marco said suddenly; and he caught The Rat's hand.\n\nThe Rat's own movement was sudden. He slipped from his crutches to a\nchair, and sat and gazed at the worn carpet as if he were not looking at\nit at all, but at something a long way off. After a while he looked up\nat Loristan.\n\n\"Do you know what I thought of, all at once?\" he said in a shaky voice.\n\"I thought of that 'Lost Prince' one. He only lived once. Perhaps he\ndidn't live a long time. Nobody knows. But it's five hundred years ago,\nand, just because he was the kind he was, every one that remembers him\nthinks of something fine. It's queer, but it does you good just to hear\nhis name. And if he has been training kings for Samavia all these\ncenturies--they may have been poor and nobody may have known about them,\nbut they've been _kings_. That's what _he_ did--just by being alive a few\nyears. When I think of him and then think of--the other--there's such an\nawful difference that--yes--I'm sorry. For the first time. I'm his son\nand I can't care about him; but he's too lonely--I want to go.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSo it was that when the forlorn derelict was carried to the graveyard\nwhere nameless burdens on the city were given to the earth, a curious\nfuneral procession followed him. There were two tall and soldierly\nlooking men and two boys, one of whom walked on crutches, and behind\nthem were ten other boys who walked two by two. These ten were a queer,\nragged lot; but they had respectfully sober faces, held their heads and\ntheir shoulders well, and walked with a remarkably regular marching\nstep.\n\nIt was the Squad; but they had left their \"rifles\" at home.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\"COME WITH ME\"\n\n\nWhen they came back from the graveyard, The Rat was silent all the way.\nHe was thinking of what had happened and of what lay before him. He was,\nin fact, thinking chiefly that nothing lay before him--nothing. The\ncertainty of that gave his sharp, lined face new lines and sharpness\nwhich made it look pinched and hard.\n\nHe had nothing before but a corner in a bare garret in which he could\nfind little more than a leaking roof over his head--when he was not\nturned out into the street. But, if policemen asked him where he lived,\nhe could say he lived in Bone Court with his father. Now he couldn't say\nit.\n\nHe got along very well on his crutches, but he was rather tired when\nthey reached the turn in the street which led in the direction of his\nold haunts. At any rate, they were haunts he knew, and he belonged\nto them more than he belonged elsewhere. The Squad stopped at this\nparticular corner because it led to such homes as they possessed. They\nstopped in a body and looked at The Rat, and The Rat stopped also. He\nswung himself to Loristan's side, touching his hand to his forehead.\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" he said. \"Line and salute, you chaps!\" And the Squad\nstood in line and raised their hands also. \"Thank you, sir. Thank you,\nMarco. Good-by.\"\n\n\"Where are you going?\" Loristan asked.\n\n\"I don't know yet,\" The Rat answered, biting his lips.\n\nHe and Loristan looked at each other a few moments in silence. Both of\nthem were thinking very hard. In The Rat's eyes there was a kind of\ndesperate adoration. He did not know what he should do when this man\nturned and walked away from him. It would be as if the sun itself had\ndropped out of the heavens--and The Rat had not thought of what the sun\nmeant before.\n\nBut Loristan did not turn and walk away. He looked deep into the lad's\neyes as if he were searching to find some certainty. Then he said in a\nlow voice, \"You know how poor I am.\"\n\n\"I--I don't care!\" said The Rat. \"You--you're like a king to me. I'd\nstand up and be shot to bits if you told me to do it.\"\n\n\"I am so poor that I am not sure I can give you enough dry bread to\neat--always. Marco and Lazarus and I are often hungry. Sometimes you\nmight have nothing to sleep on but the floor. But I can find a _place_ for\nyou if I take you with me,\" said Loristan. \"Do you know what I mean by a\n_place_?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" answered The Rat. \"It's what I've never had before--sir.\"\n\nWhat he knew was that it meant some bit of space, out of all the world,\nwhere he would have a sort of right to stand, howsoever poor and bare it\nmight be.\n\n\"I'm not used to beds or to food enough,\" he said. But he did not dare\nto insist too much on that \"place.\" It seemed too great a thing to be\ntrue.\n\nLoristan took his arm.\n\n\"Come with me,\" he said. \"We won't part. I believe you are to be\ntrusted.\"\n\nThe Rat turned quite white in a sort of anguish of joy. He had never\ncared for any one in his life. He had been a sort of young Cain, his\nhand against every man and every man's hand against him. And during the\nlast twelve hours he had plunged into a tumultuous ocean of boyish\nhero-worship. This man seemed like a sort of god to him. What he had\nsaid and done the day before, in what had been really The Rat's hours of\nextremity, after that appalling night--the way he had looked into his\nface and understood it all, the talk at the table when he had listened\nto him seriously, comprehending and actually respecting his plans and\nrough maps; his silent companionship as they followed the pauper hearse\ntogether--these things were enough to make the lad longingly ready to be\nany sort of servant or slave to him if he might see and be spoken to by\nhim even once or twice a day.\n\nThe Squad wore a look of dismay for a moment, and Loristan saw it.\n\n\"I am going to take your captain with me,\" he said. \"But he will come\nback to Barracks. So will Marco.\"\n\n\"Will yer go on with the game?\" asked Cad, as eager spokesman. \"We want\nto go on being the 'Secret Party.'\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll go on,\" The Rat answered. \"I won't give it up. There's a lot\nin the papers to-day.\"\n\nSo they were pacified and went on their way, and Loristan and Lazarus\nand Marco and The Rat went on theirs also.\n\n\"Queer thing is,\" The Rat thought as they walked together, \"I'm a bit\nafraid to speak to him unless he speaks to me first. Never felt that way\nbefore with any one.\"\n\nHe had jeered at policemen and had impudently chaffed \"swells,\" but he\nfelt a sort of secret awe of this man, and actually liked the feeling.\n\n\"It's as if I was a private and he was commander-in-chief,\" he thought.\n\"That's it.\"\n\nLoristan talked to him as they went. He was simple enough in his\nstatements of the situation. There was an old sofa in Marco's bedroom.\nIt was narrow and hard, as Marco's bed itself was, but The Rat could\nsleep upon it. They would share what food they had. There were\nnewspapers and magazines to be read. There were papers and pencils to\ndraw new maps and plans of battles. There was even an old map of Samavia\nof Marco's which the two boys could study together as an aid to their\ngame. The Rat's eyes began to have points of fire in them.\n\n\"If I could see the papers every morning, I could fight the battles on\npaper by night,\" he said, quite panting at the incredible vision of\nsplendor. Were all the kingdoms of the earth going to be given to him?\nWas he going to sleep without a drunken father near him?\n\nWas he going to have a chance to wash himself and to sit at a table and\nhear people say \"Thank you,\" and \"I beg pardon,\" as if they were using\nthe most ordinary fashion of speech? His own father, before he had sunk\ninto the depths, had lived and spoken in this way.\n\n\"When I have time, we will see who can draw up the best plans,\" Loristan\nsaid.\n\n\"Do you mean that you'll look at mine then--when you have time?\" asked\nThe Rat, hesitatingly. \"I wasn't expecting that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Loristan, \"I'll look at them, and we'll talk them over.\"\n\nAs they went on, he told him that he and Marco could do many things\ntogether. They could go to museums and galleries, and Marco could show\nhim what he himself was familiar with.\n\n\"My father said you wouldn't let him come back to Barracks when you\nfound out about it,\" The Rat said, hesitating again and growing hot\nbecause he remembered so many ugly past days. \"But--but I swear I won't\ndo him any harm, sir. I won't!\"\n\n\"When I said I believed you could be trusted, I meant several things,\"\nLoristan answered him. \"That was one of them. You're a new recruit. You\nand Marco are both under a commanding officer.\" He said the words\nbecause he knew they would elate him and stir his blood.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\n\"ONLY TWO BOYS\"\n\n\nThe words did elate him, and his blood was stirred by them every time\nthey returned to his mind. He remembered them through the days and\nnights that followed. He sometimes, indeed, awakened from his deep sleep\non the hard and narrow sofa in Marco's room, and found that he was\nsaying them half aloud to himself. The hardness of the sofa did not\nprevent his resting as he had never rested before in his life. By\ncontrast with the past he had known, this poor existence was comfort\nwhich verged on luxury. He got into the battered tin bath every morning,\nhe sat at the clean table, and could look at Loristan and speak to him\nand hear his voice. His chief trouble was that he could hardly keep his\neyes off him, and he was a little afraid he might be annoyed. But he\ncould not bear to lose a look or a movement.\n\nAt the end of the second day, he found his way, at some trouble, to\nLazarus's small back room at the top of the house.\n\n\"Will you let me come in and talk a bit?\" he said.\n\nWhen he went in, he was obliged to sit on the top of Lazarus's wooden\nbox because there was nothing else for him.\n\n\"I want to ask you,\" he plunged into his talk at once, \"do you think he\nminds me looking at him so much? I can't help it--but if he hates\nit--well--I'll try and keep my eyes on the table.\"\n\n\"The Master is used to being looked at,\" Lazarus made answer. \"But it\nwould be well to ask himself. He likes open speech.\"\n\n\"I want to find out everything he likes and everything he doesn't like,\"\nThe Rat said. \"I want--isn't there anything--anything you'd let me do\nfor him? It wouldn't matter what it was. And he needn't know you are not\ndoing it. I know you wouldn't be willing to give up anything particular.\nBut you wait on him night and day. Couldn't you give up something to\nme?\"\n\nLazarus pierced him with keen eyes. He did not answer for several\nseconds.\n\n\"Now and then,\" he said gruffly at last, \"I'll let you brush his boots.\nBut not every day--perhaps once a week.\"\n\n\"When will you let me have my first turn?\" The Rat asked.\n\nLazarus reflected. His shaggy eyebrows drew themselves down over his\neyes as if this were a question of state.\n\n\"Next Saturday,\" he conceded. \"Not before. I'll tell him when you brush\nthem.\"\n\n\"You needn't,\" said The Rat. \"It's not that I want him to know. I want\nto know myself that I'm doing something for him. I'll find out things\nthat I can do without interfering with you. I'll think them out.\"\n\n\"Anything any one else did for him would be interfering with me,\" said\nLazarus.\n\nIt was The Rat's turn to reflect now, and his face twisted itself into\nnew lines and wrinkles.\n\n\"I'll tell you before I do anything,\" he said, after he had thought it\nover. \"You served him first.\"\n\n\"I have served him ever since he was born,\" said Lazarus.\n\n\"He's--he's yours,\" said The Rat, still thinking deeply.\n\n\"I am his,\" was Lazarus's stern answer. \"I am his--and the young\nMaster's.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" The Rat said. Then a squeak of a half-laugh broke from him.\n\"I've never been anybody's,\" he added.\n\nHis sharp eyes caught a passing look on Lazarus's face. Such a queer,\ndisturbed, sudden look. Could he be rather sorry for him?\n\nPerhaps the look meant something like that.\n\n\"If you stay near him long enough--and it needn't be long--you will be\nhis too. Everybody is.\"\n\nThe Rat sat up as straight as he could. \"When it comes to that,\" he\nblurted out, \"I'm his now, in my way. I was his two minutes after he\nlooked at me with his queer, handsome eyes. They're queer because they\nget you, and you want to follow him. I'm going to follow.\"\n\nThat night Lazarus recounted to his master the story of the scene. He\nsimply repeated word for word what had been said, and Loristan listened\ngravely.\n\n\"We have not had time to learn much of him yet,\" he commented. \"But that\nis a faithful soul, I think.\"\n\nA few days later, Marco missed The Rat soon after their breakfast hour.\nHe had gone out without saying anything to the household. He did not\nreturn for several hours, and when he came back he looked tired. In the\nafternoon he fell asleep on his sofa in Marco's room and slept heavily.\nNo one asked him any questions as he volunteered no explanation. The\nnext day he went out again in the same mysterious manner, and the next\nand the next. For an entire week he went out and returned with the tired\nlook; but he did not explain until one morning, as he lay on his sofa\nbefore getting up, he said to Marco:\n\n\"I'm practicing walking with my crutches. I don't want to go about like\na rat any more. I mean to be as near like other people as I can. I walk\nfarther every morning. I began with two miles. If I practice every day,\nmy crutches will be like legs.\"\n\n\"Shall I walk with you?\" asked Marco.\n\n\"Wouldn't you mind walking with a cripple?\"\n\n\"Don't call yourself that,\" said Marco. \"We can talk together, and try\nto remember everything we see as we go along.\"\n\n\"I want to learn to remember things. I'd like to train myself in that\nway too,\" The Rat answered. \"I'd give anything to know some of the\nthings your father taught you. I've got a good memory. I remember a lot\nof things I don't want to remember. Will you go this morning?\"\n\nThat morning they went, and Loristan was told the reason for their walk.\nBut though he knew one reason, he did not know all about it. When The\nRat was allowed his \"turn\" of the boot-brushing, he told more to\nLazarus.\n\n\"What I want to do,\" he said, \"is not only walk as fast as other people\ndo, but faster. Acrobats train themselves to do anything. It's training\nthat does it. There might come a time when he might need some one to go\non an errand quickly, and I'm going to be ready. I'm going to train\nmyself until he needn't think of me as if I were only a cripple who\ncan't do things and has to be taken care of. I want him to know that I'm\nreally as strong as Marco, and where Marco can go I can go.\"\n\n\"He\" was what he always said, and Lazarus always understood without\nexplanation.\n\n\"'The Master' is your name for him,\" he had explained at the beginning.\n\"And I can't call him just 'Mister' Loristan. It sounds like cheek. If\nhe was called 'General' or 'Colonel' I could stand it--though it\nwouldn't be quite right. Some day I shall find a name. When I speak to\nhim, I say 'Sir.'\"\n\nThe walks were taken every day, and each day were longer. Marco found\nhimself silently watching The Rat with amazement at his determination\nand endurance. He knew that he must not speak of what he could not fail\nto see as they walked. He must not tell him that he looked tired and\npale and sometimes desperately fatigued. He had inherited from his\nfather the tact which sees what people do not wish to be reminded of. He\nknew that for some reason of his own The Rat had determined to do this\nthing at any cost to himself. Sometimes his face grew white and worn and\nhe breathed hard, but he never rested more than a few minutes, and never\nturned back or shortened a walk they had planned.\n\n\"Tell me something about Samavia, something to remember,\" he would say,\nwhen he looked his worst. \"When I begin to try to remember, I\nforget--other things.\"\n\nSo, as they went on their way, they talked, and The Rat committed things\nto memory. He was quick at it, and grew quicker every day. They invented\na game of remembering faces they passed. Both would learn them by heart,\nand on their return home Marco would draw them. They went to the museums\nand galleries and learned things there, making from memory lists and\ndescriptions which at night they showed to Loristan, when he was not too\nbusy to talk to them.\n\nAs the days passed, Marco saw that The Rat was gaining strength. This\nexhilarated him greatly. They often went to Hampstead Heath and walked\nin the wind and sun. There The Rat would go through curious exercises\nwhich he believed would develop his muscles. He began to look less tired\nduring and after his journey. There were even fewer wrinkles on his\nface, and his sharp eyes looked less fierce. The talks between the two\nboys were long and curious. Marco soon realized that The Rat wanted to\nlearn--learn--learn.\n\n\"Your father can talk to you almost as if you were twenty years old,\" he\nsaid once. \"He knows you can understand what he's saying. If he were to\ntalk to me, he'd always have to remember that I was only a rat that had\nlived in gutters and seen nothing else.\"\n\nThey were talking in their room, as they nearly always did after they\nwent to bed and the street lamp shone in and lighted their bare little\nroom. They often sat up clasping their knees, Marco on his poor bed,\nThe Rat on his hard sofa, but neither of them conscious either of the\npoorness or hardness, because to each one the long unknown sense of\ncompanionship was such a satisfying thing. Neither of them had ever\ntalked intimately to another boy, and now they were together day and\nnight. They revealed their thoughts to each other; they told each other\nthings it had never before occurred to either to think of telling any\none. In fact, they found out about themselves, as they talked, things\nthey had not quite known before. Marco had gradually discovered that the\nadmiration The Rat had for his father was an impassioned and curious\nfeeling which possessed him entirely. It seemed to Marco that it was\nbeginning to be like a sort of religion. He evidently thought of him\nevery moment. So when he spoke of Loristan's knowing him to be only a\nrat of the gutter, Marco felt he himself was fortunate in remembering\nsomething he could say.\n\n\"My father said yesterday that you had a big brain and a strong will,\"\nhe answered from his bed. \"He said that you had a wonderful memory which\nonly needed exercising. He said it after he looked over the list you\nmade of the things you had seen in the Tower.\"\n\nThe Rat shuffled on his sofa and clasped his knees tighter.\n\n\"Did he? Did he?\" he said.\n\nHe rested his chin upon his knees for a few minutes and stared straight\nbefore him. Then he turned to the bed.\n\n\"Marco,\" he said, in a rather hoarse voice, a queer voice; \"are you\njealous?\"\n\n\"Jealous,\" said Marco; \"why?\"\n\n\"I mean, have you ever been jealous? Do you know what it is like?\"\n\n\"I don't think I do,\" answered Marco, staring a little.\n\n\"Are you ever jealous of Lazarus because he's always with your\nfather--because he's with him oftener than you are--and knows about his\nwork--and can do things for him you can't? I mean, are you jealous\nof--your father?\"\n\nMarco loosed his arms from his knees and lay down flat on his pillow.\n\n\"No, I'm not. The more people love and serve him, the better,\" he said.\n\"The only thing I care for is--is him. I just care for _him_. Lazarus does\ntoo. Don't you?\"\n\nThe Rat was greatly excited internally. He had been thinking of this\nthing a great deal. The thought had sometimes terrified him. He might\nas well have it out now if he could. If he could get at the truth,\neverything would be easier. But would Marco really tell him?\n\n\"Don't you mind?\" he said, still hoarse and eager--\"don't you mind how\nmuch I care for him? Could it ever make you feel savage? Could it ever\nset you thinking I was nothing but--what I am--and that it was cheek of\nme to push myself in and fasten on to a gentleman who only took me up\nfor charity? Here's the living truth,\" he ended in an outburst; \"if I\nwere you and you were me, that's what I should be thinking. I know it\nis. I couldn't help it. I should see every low thing there was in you,\nin your manners and your voice and your looks. I should see nothing but\nthe contrast between you and me and between you and him. I should be so\njealous that I should just rage. I should _hate_ you--and I should\n_despise_ you!\"\n\nHe had wrought himself up to such a passion of feeling that he set Marco\nthinking that what he was hearing meant strange and strong emotions such\nas he himself had never experienced. The Rat had been thinking over all\nthis in secret for some time, it was evident. Marco lay still a few\nminutes and thought it over. Then he found something to say, just as he\nhad found something before.\n\n\"You might, if you were with other people who thought in the same way,\"\nhe said, \"and if you hadn't found out that it is such a mistake to think\nin that way, that it's even stupid. But, you see, if you were I, you\nwould have lived with my father, and he'd have told you what he\nknows--what he's been finding out all his life.\"\n\n\"What's he found out?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" Marco answered, quite casually, \"just that you can't set savage\nthoughts loose in the world, any more than you can let loose savage\nbeasts with hydrophobia. They spread a sort of rabies, and they always\ntear and worry you first of all.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" The Rat gasped out.\n\n\"It's like this,\" said Marco, lying flat and cool on his hard pillow and\nlooking at the reflection of the street lamp on the ceiling. \"That day\nI turned into your Barracks, without knowing that you'd think I was\nspying, it made you feel savage, and you threw the stone at me. If it\nhad made me feel savage and I'd rushed in and fought, what would have\nhappened to all of us?\"\n\nThe Rat's spirit of generalship gave the answer.\n\n\"I should have called on the Squad to charge with fixed bayonets. They'd\nhave half killed you. You're a strong chap, and you'd have hurt a lot of\nthem.\"\n\nA note of terror broke into his voice. \"What a fool I should have been!\"\nhe cried out. \"I should never have come here! I should never have known\n_him_!\" Even by the light of the street lamp Marco could see him begin to\nlook almost ghastly.\n\n\"The Squad could easily have half killed me,\" Marco added. \"They could\nhave quite killed me, if they had wanted to do it. And who would have\ngot any good out of it? It would only have been a street-lads'\nrow--with the police and prison at the end of it.\"\n\n\"But because you'd lived with him,\" The Rat pondered, \"you walked in as\nif you didn't mind, and just asked why we did it, and looked like a\nstronger chap than any of us--and different--different. I wondered what\nwas the matter with you, you were so cool and steady. I know now. It was\nbecause you were like him. He'd taught you. He's like a wizard.\"\n\n\"He knows things that wizards think they know, but he knows them\nbetter,\" Marco said. \"He says they're not queer and unnatural. They're\njust simple laws of nature. You have to be either on one side or the\nother, like an army. You choose your side. You either build up or tear\ndown. You either keep in the light where you can see, or you stand in\nthe dark and fight everything that comes near you, because you can't see\nand you think it's an enemy. No, you wouldn't have been jealous if you'd\nbeen I and I'd been you.\"\n\n\"And you're _not_?\" The Rat's sharp voice was almost hollow. \"You'll swear\nyou're not?\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" said Marco.\n\nThe Rat's excitement even increased a shade as he poured forth his\nconfession.\n\n\"I was afraid,\" he said. \"I've been afraid every day since I came here.\nI'll tell you straight out. It seemed just natural that you and Lazarus\nwouldn't stand me, just as I wouldn't have stood you. It seemed just\nnatural that you'd work together to throw me out. I knew how I should\nhave worked myself. Marco--I said I'd tell you straight out--I'm jealous\nof you. I'm jealous of Lazarus. It makes me wild when I see you both\nknowing all about him, and fit and ready to do anything he wants done.\nI'm not ready and I'm not fit.\"\n\n\"You'd do anything he wanted done, whether you were fit and ready or\nnot,\" said Marco. \"He knows that.\"\n\n\"Does he? Do you think he does?\" cried The Rat. \"I wish he'd try me. I\nwish he would.\"\n\nMarco turned over on his bed and rose up on his elbow so that he faced\nThe Rat on his sofa.\n\n\"Let us _wait_,\" he said in a whisper. \"Let us _wait_.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and then The Rat whispered also.\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For him to find out that we're fit to be tried. Don't you see what\nfools we should be if we spent our time in being jealous, either of us.\nWe're only two boys. Suppose he saw we were only two silly fools. When\nyou are jealous of me or of Lazarus, just go and sit down in a still\nplace and think of _him_. Don't think about yourself or about us. He's so\nquiet that to think about him makes you quiet yourself. When things go\nwrong or when I'm lonely, he's taught me to sit down and make myself\nthink of things I like--pictures, books, monuments, splendid places.\nIt pushes the other things out and sets your mind going properly.\nHe doesn't know I nearly always think of him. He's the best thought\nhimself. You try it. You're not really jealous. You only _think_ you are.\nYou'll find that out if you always stop yourself in time. Any one can be\nsuch a fool if he lets himself. And he can always stop it if he makes up\nhis mind. I'm not jealous. You must let that thought alone. You're not\njealous yourself. Kick that thought into the street.\"\n\nThe Rat caught his breath and threw his arms up over his eyes. \"Oh,\nLord! Oh, Lord!\" he said; \"if I'd lived near him always as you have.\nIf I just had.\"\n\n\"We're both living near him now,\" said Marco. \"And here's something to\nthink of,\" leaning more forward on his elbow. \"The kings who were being\nmade ready for Samavia have waited all these years; _We_ can make\nourselves ready and wait so that, if just two boys are wanted to do\nsomething--just two boys--we can step out of the ranks when the call\ncomes and say 'Here!' Now let's lie down and think of it until we go to\nsleep.\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nLORISTAN ATTENDS A DRILL OF THE SQUAD, AND MARCO MEETS A SAMAVIAN\n\n\nThe Squad was not forgotten. It found that Loristan himself would have\nregarded neglect as a breach of military duty.\n\n\"You must remember your men,\" he said, two or three days after The Rat\nbecame a member of his household. \"You must keep up their drill. Marco\ntells me it was very smart. Don't let them get slack.\"\n\n\"His men!\" The Rat felt what he could not have put into words.\n\nHe knew he had worked, and that the Squad had worked, in their hidden\nholes and corners. Only hidden holes and corners had been possible for\nthem because they had existed in spite of the protest of their world and\nthe vigilance of its policemen. They had tried many refuges before they\nfound the Barracks. No one but resented the existence of a troop of\nnoisy vagabonds. But somehow this man knew that there had evolved from\nit something more than mere noisy play, that he, The Rat, had _meant_\norder and discipline.\n\n\"His men!\" It made him feel as if he had had the Victoria Cross fastened\non his coat. He had brain enough to see many things, and he knew that it\nwas in this way that Loristan was finding him his \"place.\" He knew how.\n\nWhen they went to the Barracks, the Squad greeted them with a tumultuous\nwelcome which expressed a great sense of relief. Privately the members\nhad been filled with fears which they had talked over together in deep\ngloom. Marco's father, they decided, was too big a swell to let the two\ncome back after he had seen the sort the Squad was made up of. He might\nbe poor just now, toffs sometimes lost their money for a bit, but you\ncould see what he was, and fathers like him weren't going to let their\nsons make friends with \"such as us.\" He'd stop the drill and the \"Secret\nSociety\" game. That's what he'd do!\n\nBut The Rat came swinging in on his secondhand crutches looking as if\nhe had been made a general, and Marco came with him; and the drill the\nSquad was put through was stricter and finer than any drill they had\never known.\n\n\"I wish my father could have seen that,\" Marco said to The Rat.\n\nThe Rat turned red and white and then red again, but he said not a\nsingle word. The mere thought was like a flash of fire passing through\nhim. But no fellow could hope for a thing as big as that. The Secret\nParty, in its subterranean cavern, surrounded by its piled arms, sat\ndown to read the morning paper.\n\nThe war news was bad to read. The Maranovitch held the day for the\nmoment, and while they suffered and wrought cruelties in the capital\ncity, the Iarovitch suffered and wrought cruelties in the country\noutside. So fierce and dark was the record that Europe stood aghast.\n\nThe Rat folded his paper when he had finished, and sat biting his nails.\nHaving done this for a few minutes, he began to speak in his dramatic\nand hollow Secret Party whisper.\n\n\"The hour has come,\" he said to his followers. \"The messengers must go\nforth. They know nothing of what they go for; they only know that they\nmust obey. If they were caught and tortured, they could betray nothing\nbecause they know nothing but that, at certain places, they must utter\na certain word. They carry no papers. All commands they must learn by\nheart. When the sign is given, the Secret Party will know what to\ndo--where to meet and where to attack.\"\n\nHe drew plans of the battle on the flagstones, and he sketched an\nimaginary route which the two messengers were to follow. But his\nknowledge of the map of Europe was not worth much, and he turned to\nMarco.\n\n\"You know more about geography that I do. You know more about\neverything,\" he said. \"I only know Italy is at the bottom and Russia is\nat one side and England's at the other. How would the Secret Messengers\ngo to Samavia? Can you draw the countries they'd have to pass through?\"\n\nBecause any school-boy who knew the map could have done the same thing,\nMarco drew them. He also knew the stations the Secret Two would arrive\nat and leave by when they entered a city, the streets they would walk\nthrough and the very uniforms they would see; but of these things he\nsaid nothing. The reality his knowledge gave to the game was, however, a\nthrilling thing. He wished he could have been free to explain to The Rat\nthe things he knew. Together they could have worked out so many details\nof travel and possible adventure that it would have been almost as if\nthey had set out on their journey in fact.\n\nAs it was, the mere sketching of the route fired The Rat's imagination.\nHe forged ahead with the story of adventure, and filled it with such\nmysterious purport and design that the Squad at times gasped for breath.\nIn his glowing version the Secret Two entered cities by midnight and\nsang and begged at palace gates where kings driving outward paused to\nlisten and were given the Sign.\n\n\"Though it would not always be kings,\" he said. \"Sometimes it would\nbe the poorest people. Sometimes they might seem to be beggars like\nourselves, when they were only Secret Ones disguised. A great lord might\nwear poor clothes and pretend to be a workman, and we should only know\nhim by the signs we had learned by heart. When we were sent to Samavia,\nwe should be obliged to creep in through some back part of the country\nwhere no fighting was being done and where no one would attack. Their\ngenerals are not clever enough to protect the parts which are joined to\nfriendly countries, and they have not forces enough. Two boys could find\na way in if they thought it out.\"\n\nHe became possessed by the idea of thinking it out on the spot. He drew\nhis rough map of Samavia on the flagstones with his chalk.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said to Marco, who, with the elated and thrilled Squad,\nbent over it in a close circle of heads. \"Beltrazo is here and Carnolitz\nis here--and here is Jiardasia. Beltrazo and Jiardasia are friendly,\nthough they don't take sides. All the fighting is going on in the\ncountry about Melzarr. There is no reason why they should prevent single\ntravelers from coming in across the frontiers of friendly neighbors.\nThey're not fighting with the countries outside, they are fighting with\nthemselves.\" He paused a moment and thought.\n\n\"The article in that magazine said something about a huge forest on the\neastern frontier. That's here. We could wander into a forest and stay\nthere until we'd planned all we wanted to do. Even the people who had\nseen us would forget about us. What we have to do is to make people feel\nas if we were nothing--nothing.\"\n\nThey were in the very midst of it, crowded together, leaning over,\nstretching necks and breathing quickly with excitement, when Marco\nlifted his head. Some mysterious impulse made him do it in spite of\nhimself.\n\n\"There's my father!\" he said.\n\nThe chalk dropped, everything dropped, even Samavia. The Rat was up and\non his crutches as if some magic force had swung him there. How he gave\nthe command, or if he gave it at all, not even he himself knew. But the\nSquad stood at salute.\n\nLoristan was standing at the opening of the archway as Marco had stood\nthat first day. He raised his right hand in return salute and came\nforward.\n\n\"I was passing the end of the street and remembered the Barracks was\nhere,\" he explained. \"I thought I should like to look at your men,\nCaptain.\"\n\nHe smiled, but it was not a smile which made his words really a joke. He\nlooked down at the chalk map drawn on the flagstones.\n\n\"You know that map well,\" he said. \"Even I can see that it is Samavia.\nWhat is the Secret Party doing?\"\n\n\"The messengers are trying to find a way in,\" answered Marco.\n\n\"We can get in there,\" said The Rat, pointing with a crutch. \"There's a\nforest where we could hide and find out things.\"\n\n\"Reconnoiter,\" said Loristan, looking down. \"Yes. Two stray boys could\nbe very safe in a forest. It's a good game.\"\n\nThat he should be there! That he should, in his own wonderful way, have\ngiven them such a thing as this. That he should have cared enough even\nto look up the Barracks, was what The Rat was thinking. A batch of\nragamuffins they were and nothing else, and he standing looking at them\nwith his fine smile. There was something about him which made him seem\neven splendid. The Rat's heart thumped with startled joy.\n\n\"Father,\" said Marco, \"will you watch The Rat drill us? I want you to\nsee how well it is done.\"\n\n\"Captain, will you do me that honor?\" Loristan said to The Rat, and\nto even these words he gave the right tone, neither jesting nor too\nserious. Because it was so right a tone, The Rat's pulses beat only with\nexultation. This god of his had looked at his maps, he had talked of his\nplans, he had come to see the soldiers who were his work! The Rat began\nhis drill as if he had been reviewing an army.\n\nWhat Loristan saw done was wonderful in its mechanical exactness.\n\nThe Squad moved like the perfect parts of a perfect machine. That they\ncould so do it in such space, and that they should have accomplished\nsuch precision, was an extraordinary testimonial to the military\nefficiency and curious qualities of this one hunchbacked, vagabond\nofficer.\n\n\"That is magnificent!\" the spectator said, when it was over. \"It could\nnot be better done. Allow me to congratulate you.\"\n\nHe shook The Rat's hand as if it had been a man's, and, after he had\nshaken it, he put his own hand lightly on the boy's shoulder and let it\nrest there as he talked a few minutes to them all.\n\nHe kept his talk within the game, and his clear comprehension of it\nadded a flavor which even the dullest member of the Squad was elated by.\nSometimes you couldn't understand toffs when they made a shy at being\nfriendly, but you could understand him, and he stirred up your spirits.\nHe didn't make jokes with you, either, as if a chap had to be kept\ngrinning. After the few minutes were over, he went away. Then they sat\ndown again in their circle and talked about him, because they could talk\nand think about nothing else. They stared at Marco furtively, feeling as\nif he were a creature of another world because he had lived with this\nman. They stared at The Rat in a new way also. The wonderful-looking\nhand had rested on his shoulder, and he had been told that what he had\ndone was magnificent.\n\n\"When you said you wished your father could have seen the drill,\" said\nThe Rat, \"you took my breath away. I'd never have had the cheek to think\nof it myself--and I'd never have dared to let you ask him, even if you\nwanted to do it. And he came himself! It struck me dumb.\"\n\n\"If he came,\" said Marco, \"it was because he wanted to see it.\"\n\nWhen they had finished talking, it was time for Marco and The Rat to go\non their way. Loristan had given The Rat an errand. At a certain hour he\nwas to present himself at a certain shop and receive a package.\n\n\"Let him do it alone,\" Loristan said to Marco. \"He will be better\npleased. His desire is to feel that he is trusted to do things alone.\"\n\nSo they parted at a street corner, Marco to walk back to No. 7 Philibert\nPlace, The Rat to execute his commission. Marco turned into one of the\nbetter streets, through which he often passed on his way home. It was\nnot a fashionable quarter, but it contained some respectable houses in\nwhose windows here and there were to be seen neat cards bearing the word\n\"Apartments,\" which meant that the owner of the house would let to\nlodgers his drawing-room or sitting-room suite.\n\nAs Marco walked up the street, he saw some one come out of the door of\none of the houses and walk quickly and lightly down the pavement. It was\na young woman wearing an elegant though quiet dress, and a hat which\nlooked as if it had been bought in Paris or Vienna. She had, in fact, a\nslightly foreign air, and it was this, indeed, which made Marco look at\nher long enough to see that she was also a graceful and lovely person.\nHe wondered what her nationality was. Even at some yards' distance he\ncould see that she had long dark eyes and a curved mouth which seemed to\nbe smiling to itself. He thought she might be Spanish or Italian.\n\nHe was trying to decide which of the two countries she belonged to, as\nshe drew near to him, but quite suddenly the curved mouth ceased smiling\nas her foot seemed to catch in a break in the pavement, and she so lost\nher balance that she would have fallen if he had not leaped forward and\ncaught her.\n\nShe was light and slender, and he was a strong lad and managed to steady\nher. An expression of sharp momentary anguish crossed her face.\n\n\"I hope you are not hurt,\" Marco said.\n\nShe bit her lip and clutched his shoulder very hard with her slim hand.\n\n\"I have twisted my ankle,\" she answered. \"I am afraid I have twisted it\nbadly. Thank you for saving me. I should have had a bad fall.\"\n\nHer long, dark eyes were very sweet and grateful. She tried to smile,\nbut there was such distress under the effort that Marco was afraid she\nmust have hurt herself very much.\n\n\"Can you stand on your foot at all?\" he asked.\n\n\"I can stand a little now,\" she said, \"but I might not be able to stand\nin a few minutes. I must get back to the house while I can bear to touch\nthe ground with it. I am so sorry. I am afraid I shall have to ask you\nto go with me. Fortunately it is only a few yards away.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Marco answered. \"I saw you come out of the house. If you will\nlean on my shoulder, I can soon help you back. I am glad to do it. Shall\nwe try now?\"\n\nShe had a gentle and soft manner which would have appealed to any boy.\nHer voice was musical and her enunciation exquisite.\n\nWhether she was Spanish or Italian, it was easy to imagine her a person\nwho did not always live in London lodgings, even of the better class.\n\n\"If you please,\" she answered him. \"It is very kind of you. You are very\nstrong, I see. But I am glad to have only a few steps to go.\"\n\nShe rested on his shoulder as well as on her umbrella, but it was plain\nthat every movement gave her intense pain. She caught her lip with her\nteeth, and Marco thought she turned white. He could not help liking her.\nShe was so lovely and gracious and brave. He could not bear to see the\nsuffering in her face.\n\n\"I am so sorry!\" he said, as he helped her, and his boy's voice had\nsomething of the wonderful sympathetic tone of Loristan's. The beautiful\nlady herself remarked it, and thought how unlike it was to the ordinary\nboy-voice.\n\n\"I have a latch-key,\" she said, when they stood on the low step.\n\nShe found the latch-key in her purse and opened the door. Marco helped\nher into the entrance-hall. She sat down at once in a chair near the\nhat-stand. The place was quite plain and old-fashioned inside.\n\n\"Shall I ring the front-door bell to call some one?\" Marco inquired.\n\n\"I am afraid that the servants are out,\" she answered. \"They had a\nholiday. Will you kindly close the door? I shall be obliged to ask you\nto help me into the sitting-room at the end of the hall. I shall find\nall I want there--if you will kindly hand me a few things. Some one may\ncome in presently--perhaps one of the other lodgers--and, even if I am\nalone for an hour or so, it will not really matter.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I can find the landlady,\" Marco suggested. The beautiful person\nsmiled.\n\n\"She has gone to her sister's wedding. That is why I was going out to\nspend the day myself. I arranged the plan to accommodate her. How good\nyou are! I shall be quite comfortable directly, really. I can get to my\neasy-chair in the sitting-room now I have rested a little.\"\n\nMarco helped her to her feet, and her sharp, involuntary exclamation of\npain made him wince internally. Perhaps it was a worse sprain than she\nknew.\n\nThe house was of the early-Victorian London order. A \"front lobby\" with\na dining-room on the right hand, and a \"back lobby,\" after the foot\nof the stairs was passed, out of which opened the basement kitchen\nstaircase and a sitting-room looking out on a gloomy flagged back yard\ninclosed by high walls. The sitting-room was rather gloomy itself, but\nthere were a few luxurious things among the ordinary furnishings. There\nwas an easy-chair with a small table near it, and on the table were a\nsilver lamp and some rather elegant trifles. Marco helped his charge to\nthe easy-chair and put a cushion from the sofa under her foot. He did it\nvery gently, and, as he rose after doing it, he saw that the long, soft\ndark eyes were looking at him in a curious way.\n\n\"I must go away now,\" he said, \"but I do not like to leave you. May I go\nfor a doctor?\"\n\n\"How dear you are!\" she exclaimed. \"But I do not want one, thank you. I\nknow exactly what to do for a sprained ankle. And perhaps mine is not\nreally a sprain. I am going to take off my shoe and see.\"\n\n\"May I help you?\" Marco asked, and he kneeled down again and carefully\nunfastened her shoe and withdrew it from her foot. It was a slender and\ndelicate foot in a silk stocking, and she bent and gently touched and\nrubbed it.\n\n\"No,\" she said, when she raised herself, \"I do not think it is a sprain.\nNow that the shoe is off and the foot rests on the cushion, it is much\nmore comfortable, much more. Thank you, thank you. If you had not been\npassing I might have had a dangerous fall.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to have been able to help you,\" Marco answered, with an\nair of relief. \"Now I must go, if you think you will be all right.\"\n\n\"Don't go yet,\" she said, holding out her hand. \"I should like to know\nyou a little better, if I may. I am so grateful. I should like to talk\nto you. You have such beautiful manners for a boy,\" she ended, with a\npretty, kind laugh, \"and I believe I know where you got them from.\"\n\n\"You are very kind to me,\" Marco answered, wondering if he did not\nredden a little. \"But I must go because my father will--\"\n\n\"Your father would let you stay and talk to me,\" she said, with even a\nprettier kindliness than before. \"It is from him you have inherited your\nbeautiful manner. He was once a friend of mine. I hope he is my friend\nstill, though perhaps he has forgotten me.\"\n\nAll that Marco had ever learned and all that he had ever trained himself\nto remember, quickly rushed back upon him now, because he had a clear\nand rapidly working brain, and had not lived the ordinary boy's life.\nHere was a beautiful lady of whom he knew nothing at all but that she\nhad twisted her foot in the street and he had helped her back into her\nhouse. If silence was still the order, it was not for him to know things\nor ask questions or answer them. She might be the loveliest lady in the\nworld and his father her dearest friend, but, even if this were so, he\ncould best serve them both by obeying her friend's commands with all\ncourtesy, and forgetting no instruction he had given.\n\n\"I do not think my father ever forgets any one,\" he answered.\n\n\"No, I am sure he does not,\" she said softly. \"Has he been to Samavia\nduring the last three years?\"\n\nMarco paused a moment.\n\n\"Perhaps I am not the boy you think I am,\" he said. \"My father has never\nbeen to Samavia.\"\n\n\"He has not? But--you are Marco Loristan?\"\n\n\"Yes. That is my name.\"\n\nSuddenly she leaned forward and her long lovely eyes filled with fire.\n\n\"Then you are a Samavian, and you know of the disasters overwhelming us.\nYou know all the hideousness and barbarity of what is being done. Your\nfather's son must know it all!\"\n\n\"Every one knows it,\" said Marco.\n\n\"But it is your country--your own! Your blood must burn in your veins!\"\n\nMarco stood quite still and looked at her. His eyes told whether his\nblood burned or not, but he did not speak. His look was answer enough,\nsince he did not wish to say anything.\n\n\"What does your father think? I am a Samavian myself, and I think night\nand day. What does he think of the rumor about the descendant of the\nLost Prince? Does he believe it?\"\n\nMarco was thinking very rapidly. Her beautiful face was glowing with\nemotion, her beautiful voice trembled. That she should be a Samavian,\nand love Samavia, and pour her feeling forth even to a boy, was deeply\nmoving to him. But howsoever one was moved, one must remember that\nsilence was still the order. When one was very young, one must remember\norders first of all.\n\n\"It might be only a newspaper story,\" he said. \"He says one cannot trust\nsuch things. If you know him, you know he is very calm.\"\n\n\"Has he taught you to be calm too?\" she said pathetically. \"You are only\na boy. Boys are not calm. Neither are women when their hearts are wrung.\nOh, my Samavia! Oh, my poor little country! My brave, tortured country!\"\nand with a sudden sob she covered her face with her hands.\n\nA great lump mounted to Marco's throat. Boys could not cry, but he knew\nwhat she meant when he said her heart was wrung.\n\nWhen she lifted her head, the tears in her eyes made them softer than\never.\n\n\"If I were a million Samavians instead of one woman, I should know what\nto do!\" she cried. \"If your father were a million Samavians, he would\nknow, too. He would find Ivor's descendant, if he is on the earth, and\nhe would end all this horror!\"\n\n\"Who would not end it if they could?\" cried Marco, quite fiercely.\n\n\"But men like your father, men who are Samavians, must think night and\nday about it as I do,\" she impetuously insisted. \"You see, I cannot help\npouring my thoughts out even to a boy--because he is a Samavian. Only\nSamavians care. Samavia seems so little and unimportant to other people.\nThey don't even seem to know that the blood she is pouring forth pours\nfrom human veins and beating human hearts. Men like your father must\nthink, and plan, and feel that they must--must find a way. Even a woman\nfeels it. Even a boy must. Stefan Loristan cannot be sitting quietly at\nhome, knowing that Samavian hearts are being shot through and Samavian\nblood poured forth. He cannot think and say _nothing_!\"\n\nMarco started in spite of himself. He felt as if his father had been\nstruck in the face. How dare she say such words! Big as he was, suddenly\nhe looked bigger, and the beautiful lady saw that he did.\n\n\"He is my father,\" he said slowly.\n\nShe was a clever, beautiful person, and saw that she had made a great\nmistake.\n\n\"You must forgive me,\" she exclaimed. \"I used the wrong words because I\nwas excited. That is the way with women. You must see that I meant that\nI knew he was giving his heart and strength, his whole being, to\nSamavia, even though he must stay in London.\"\n\nShe started and turned her head to listen to the sound of some one using\nthe latch-key and opening the front door. The some one came in with the\nheavy step of a man.\n\n\"It is one of the lodgers,\" she said. \"I think it is the one who lives\nin the third floor sitting-room.\"\n\n\"Then you won't be alone when I go,\" said Marco. \"I am glad some one has\ncome. I will say good-morning. May I tell my father your name?\"\n\n\"Tell me that you are not angry with me for expressing myself so\nawkwardly,\" she said.\n\n\"You couldn't have meant it. I know that,\" Marco answered boyishly. \"You\ncouldn't.\"\n\n\"No, I couldn't,\" she repeated, with the same emphasis on the words.\n\nShe took a card from a silver case on the table and gave it to him.\n\n\"Your father will remember my name,\" she said. \"I hope he will let me\nsee him and tell him how you took care of me.\"\n\nShe shook his hand warmly and let him go. But just as he reached the\ndoor she spoke again.\n\n\"Oh, may I ask you to do one thing more before you leave me?\" she said\nsuddenly. \"I hope you won't mind. Will you run up-stairs into the\ndrawing-room and bring me the purple book from the small table? I shall\nnot mind being alone if I have something to read.\"\n\n\"A purple book? On a small table?\" said Marco.\n\n\"Between the two long windows,\" she smiled back at him.\n\nThe drawing-room of such houses as these is always to be reached by one\nshort flight of stairs.\n\nMarco ran up lightly.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nMARCO DOES NOT ANSWER\n\n\nBy the time he turned the corner of the stairs, the beautiful lady had\nrisen from her seat in the back room and walked into the dining-room at\nthe front. A heavily-built, dark-bearded man was standing inside the\ndoor as if waiting for her.\n\n\"I could do nothing with him,\" she said at once, in her soft voice,\nspeaking quite prettily and gently, as if what she said was the most\nnatural thing in the world. \"I managed the little trick of the sprained\nfoot really well, and got him into the house. He is an amiable boy with\nperfect manners, and I thought it might be easy to surprise him into\nsaying more than he knew he was saying. You can generally do that with\nchildren and young things. But he either knows nothing or has been\ntrained to hold his tongue. He's not stupid, and he's of a high spirit.\nI made a pathetic little scene about Samavia, because I saw he could be\nworked up. It did work him up. I tried him with the Lost Prince rumor;\nbut, if there is truth in it, he does not or will not know. I tried to\nmake him lose his temper and betray something in defending his father,\nwhom he thinks a god, by the way. But I made a mistake. I saw that. It's\na pity. Boys can sometimes be made to tell anything.\" She spoke very\nquickly under her breath. The man spoke quickly too.\n\n\"Where is he?\" he asked.\n\n\"I sent him up to the drawing-room to look for a book. He will look for\na few minutes. Listen. He's an innocent boy. He sees me only as a gentle\nangel. Nothing will _shake_ him so much as to hear me tell him the truth\nsuddenly. It will be such a shock to him that perhaps you can do\nsomething with him then. He may lose his hold on himself. He's only a\nboy.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" said the bearded man. \"And when he finds out he is not\nfree to go, it may alarm him and we may get something worth while.\"\n\n\"If we could find out what is true, or what Loristan thinks is true, we\nshould have a clue to work from,\" she said.\n\n\"We have not much time,\" the man whispered. \"We are ordered to Bosnia at\nonce. Before midnight we must be on the way.\"\n\n\"Let us go into the other room. He is coming.\"\n\nWhen Marco entered the room, the heavily-built man with the pointed dark\nbeard was standing by the easy-chair.\n\n\"I am sorry I could not find the book,\" he apologized. \"I looked on all\nthe tables.\"\n\n\"I shall be obliged to go and search for it myself,\" said the Lovely\nPerson.\n\nShe rose from her chair and stood up smiling. And at her first movement\nMarco saw that she was not disabled in the least.\n\n\"Your foot!\" he exclaimed. \"It's better?\"\n\n\"It wasn't hurt,\" she answered, in her softly pretty voice and with her\nsoftly pretty smile. \"I only made you think so.\"\n\nIt was part of her plan to spare him nothing of shock in her sudden\ntransformation. Marco felt his breath leave him for a moment.\n\n\"I made you believe I was hurt because I wanted you to come into the\nhouse with me,\" she added. \"I wished to find out certain things I am\nsure you know.\"\n\n\"They were things about Samavia,\" said the man. \"Your father knows them,\nand you must know something of them at least. It is necessary that we\nshould hear what you can tell us. We shall not allow you to leave the\nhouse until you have answered certain questions I shall ask you.\"\n\nThen Marco began to understand. He had heard his father speak of\npolitical spies, men and women who were paid to trace the people that\ncertain governments or political parties desired to have followed and\nobserved. He knew it was their work to search out secrets, to disguise\nthemselves and live among innocent people as if they were merely\nordinary neighbors.\n\nThey must be spies who were paid to follow his father because he was a\nSamavian and a patriot. He did not know that they had taken the house\ntwo months before, and had accomplished several things during their\napparently innocent stay in it. They had discovered Loristan and had\nlearned to know his outgoings and incomings, and also the outgoings and\nincomings of Lazarus, Marco, and The Rat. But they meant, if possible,\nto learn other things. If the boy could be startled and terrified into\nunconscious revelations, it might prove well worth their while to have\nplayed this bit of melodrama before they locked the front door behind\nthem and hastily crossed the Channel, leaving their landlord to discover\nfor himself that the house had been vacated.\n\nIn Marco's mind strange things were happening. They were spies! But that\nwas not all. The Lovely Person had been right when she said that he\nwould receive a shock. His strong young chest swelled. In all his life,\nhe had never come face to face with black treachery before. He could not\ngrasp it. This gentle and friendly being with the grateful soft voice\nand grateful soft eyes had betrayed--_betrayed_ him! It seemed impossible\nto believe it, and yet the smile on her curved mouth told him that it\nwas true. When he had sprung to help her, she had been playing a trick!\nWhen he had been sorry for her pain and had winced at the sound of her\nlow exclamation, she had been deliberately laying a trap to harm him.\nFor a few seconds he was stunned--perhaps, if he had not been his\nfather's son, he might have been stunned only. But he was more. When\nthe first seconds had passed, there arose slowly within him a sense of\nsomething like high, remote disdain. It grew in his deep boy's eyes as\nhe gazed directly into the pupils of the long soft dark ones. His body\nfelt as if it were growing taller.\n\n\"You are very clever,\" he said slowly. Then, after a second's pause, he\nadded, \"I was too young to know that there was any one so--clever--in\nthe world.\"\n\nThe Lovely Person laughed, but she did not laugh easily. She spoke to\nher companion.\n\n\"A _grand seigneur_!\" she said. \"As one looks at him, one half believes\nit is true.\"\n\nThe man with the beard was looking very angry. His eyes were savage and\nhis dark skin reddened. Marco thought that he looked at him as if he\nhated him, and was made fierce by the mere sight of him, for some\nmysterious reason.\n\n\"Two days before you left Moscow,\" he said, \"three men came to see your\nfather. They looked like peasants. They talked to him for more than an\nhour. They brought with them a roll of parchment. Is that not true?\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" said Marco.\n\n\"Before you went to Moscow, you were in Budapest. You went there from\nVienna. You were there for three months, and your father saw many\npeople. Some of them came in the middle of the night.\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" said Marco.\n\n\"You have spent your life in traveling from one country to another,\"\npersisted the man. \"You know the European languages as if you were a\ncourier, or the __portier__ in a Viennese hotel. Do you not?\"\n\nMarco did not answer.\n\nThe Lovely Person began to speak to the man rapidly in Russian.\n\n\"A spy and an adventurer Stefan Loristan has always been and always will\nbe,\" she said. \"We know what he is. The police in every capital in\nEurope know him as a sharper and a vagabond, as well as a spy. And yet,\nwith all his cleverness, he does not seem to have money. What did he do\nwith the bribe the Maranovitch gave him for betraying what he knew of\nthe old fortress? The boy doesn't even suspect him. Perhaps it's true\nthat he knows nothing. Or perhaps it is true that he has been so\nill-treated and flogged from his babyhood that he dare not speak. There\nis a cowed look in his eyes in spite of his childish swagger. He's been\nboth starved and beaten.\"\n\nThe outburst was well done. She did not look at Marco as she poured\nforth her words. She spoke with the abruptness and impetuosity of a\nperson whose feelings had got the better of her. If Marco was sensitive\nabout his father, she felt sure that his youth would make his face\nreveal something if his tongue did not--if he understood Russian, which\nwas one of the things it would be useful to find out, because it was a\nfact which would verify many other things.\n\nMarco's face disappointed her. No change took place in it, and the blood\ndid not rise to the surface of his skin. He listened with an\nuninterested air, blank and cold and polite. Let them say what they\nchose.\n\nThe man twisted his pointed beard and shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"We have a good little wine-cellar downstairs,\" he said. \"You are going\ndown into it, and you will probably stay there for some time if you do\nnot make up your mind to answer my questions. You think that nothing can\nhappen to you in a house in a London street where policemen walk up and\ndown. But you are mistaken. If you yelled now, even if any one chanced\nto hear you, they would only think you were a lad getting a thrashing\nhe deserved. You can yell as much as you like in the black little\nwine-cellar, and no one will hear at all. We only took this house for\nthree months, and we shall leave it to-night without mentioning the fact\nto any one. If we choose to leave you in the wine-cellar, you will wait\nthere until somebody begins to notice that no one goes in and out, and\nchances to mention it to the landlord--which few people would take the\ntrouble to do. Did you come here from Moscow?\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" said Marco.\n\n\"You might remain in the good little black cellar an unpleasantly long\ntime before you were found,\" the man went on, quite coolly. \"Do you\nremember the peasants who came to see your father two nights before you\nleft?\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" said Marco.\n\n\"By the time it was discovered that the house was empty and people came\nin to make sure, you might be too weak to call out and attract their\nattention. Did you go to Budapest from Vienna, and were you there for\nthree months?\" asked the inquisitor.\n\n\"I know nothing,\" said Marco.\n\n\"You are too good for the little black cellar,\" put in the Lovely\nPerson. \"I like you. Don't go into it!\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" Marco answered, but the eyes which were like\nLoristan's gave her just such a look as Loristan would have given her,\nand she felt it. It made her uncomfortable.\n\n\"I don't believe you were ever ill-treated or beaten,\" she said. \"I tell\nyou, the little black cellar will be a hard thing. Don't go there!\"\n\nAnd this time Marco said nothing, but looked at her still as if he were\nsome great young noble who was very proud.\n\nHe knew that every word the bearded man had spoken was true. To cry out\nwould be of no use. If they went away and left him behind them, there\nwas no knowing how many days would pass before the people of the\nneighborhood would begin to suspect that the place had been deserted, or\nhow long it would be before it occurred to some one to give warning to\nthe owner. And in the meantime, neither his father nor Lazarus nor The\nRat would have the faintest reason for guessing where he was. And he\nwould be sitting alone in the dark in the wine-cellar. He did not know\nin the least what to do about this thing. He only knew that silence was\nstill the order.\n\n\"It is a jet-black little hole,\" the man said. \"You might crack your\nthroat in it, and no one would hear. Did men come to talk with your\nfather in the middle of the night when you were in Vienna?\"\n\n\"I know nothing,\" said Marco.\n\n\"He won't tell,\" said the Lovely Person. \"I am sorry for this boy.\"\n\n\"He may tell after he has sat in the good little black wine-cellar for a\nfew hours,\" said the man with the pointed beard. \"Come with me!\"\n\nHe put his powerful hand on Marco's shoulder and pushed him before him.\nMarco made no struggle. He remembered what his father had said about the\ngame not being a game. It wasn't a game now, but somehow he had a strong\nhaughty feeling of not being afraid.\n\nHe was taken through the hallway, toward the rear, and down the\ncommonplace flagged steps which led to the basement. Then he was marched\nthrough a narrow, ill-lighted, flagged passage to a door in the wall.\nThe door was not locked and stood a trifle ajar. His companion pushed it\nfarther open and showed part of a wine-cellar which was so dark that it\nwas only the shelves nearest the door that Marco could faintly see. His\ncaptor pushed him in and shut the door. It was as black a hole as he had\ndescribed. Marco stood still in the midst of darkness like black velvet.\nHis guard turned the key.\n\n\"The peasants who came to your father in Moscow spoke Samavian and were\nbig men. Do you remember them?\" he asked from outside.\n\n\"I know nothing,\" answered Marco.\n\n\"You are a young fool,\" the voice replied. \"And I believe you know even\nmore than we thought. Your father will be greatly troubled when you do\nnot come home. I will come back to see you in a few hours, if it is\npossible. I will tell you, however, that I have had disturbing news\nwhich might make it necessary for us to leave the house in a hurry.\nI might not have time to come down here again before leaving.\"\n\nMarco stood with his back against a bit of wall and remained silent.\n\nThere was stillness for a few minutes, and then there was to be heard\nthe sound of footsteps marching away.\n\nWhen the last distant echo died all was quite silent, and Marco drew a\nlong breath. Unbelievable as it may appear, it was in one sense almost\na breath of relief. In the rush of strange feeling which had swept over\nhim when he found himself facing the astounding situation up-stairs, it\nhad not been easy to realize what his thoughts really were; there were\nso many of them and they came so fast. How could he quite believe the\nevidence of his eyes and ears? A few minutes, only a few minutes, had\nchanged his prettily grateful and kindly acquaintance into a subtle and\ncunning creature whose love for Samavia had been part of a plot to harm\nit and to harm his father.\n\nWhat did she and her companion want to do--what could they do if they\nknew the things they were trying to force him to tell?\n\nMarco braced his back against the wall stoutly.\n\n\"What will it be best to think about first?\"\n\nThis he said because one of the most absorbingly fascinating things he\nand his father talked about together was the power of the thoughts which\nhuman beings allow to pass through their minds--the strange strength of\nthem. When they talked of this, Marco felt as if he were listening to\nsome marvelous Eastern story of magic which was true. In Loristan's\ntravels, he had visited the far Oriental countries, and he had seen and\nlearned many things which seemed marvels, and they had taught him deep\nthinking. He had known, and reasoned through days with men who believed\nthat when they desired a thing, clear and exalted thought would bring it\nto them. He had discovered why they believed this, and had learned to\nunderstand their profound arguments.\n\nWhat he himself believed, he had taught Marco quite simply from his\nchildhood. It was this: he himself--Marco, with the strong boy-body, the\nthick mat of black hair, and the patched clothes--was the magician. He\nheld and waved his wand himself--and his wand was his own Thought. When\nspecial privation or anxiety beset them, it was their rule to say, \"What\nwill it be best to think about first?\" which was Marco's reason for\nsaying it to himself now as he stood in the darkness which was like\nblack velvet.\n\nHe waited a few minutes for the right thing to come to him.\n\n\"I will think of the very old hermit who lived on the ledge of the\nmountains in India and who let my father talk to him through all one\nnight,\" he said at last. This had been a wonderful story and one of his\nfavorites. Loristan had traveled far to see this ancient Buddhist, and\nwhat he had seen and heard during that one night had made changes in his\nlife. The part of the story which came back to Marco now was these\nwords:\n\n\"_Let pass through thy mind, my son, only the image thou wouldst desire\nto see a truth. Meditate only upon the wish of thy heart, seeing first\nthat it can injure no man and is not ignoble. Then will it take earthly\nform and draw near to thee. This is the law of that which creates._\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" Marco said aloud. \"I shall not be afraid. In some way\nI shall get out.\"\n\nThis was the image he wanted most to keep steadily in his mind--that\nnothing could make him afraid, and that in some way he would get out of\nthe wine-cellar.\n\nHe thought of this for some minutes, and said the words over several\ntimes. He felt more like himself when he had done it.\n\n\"When my eyes are accustomed to the darkness, I shall see if there is\nany little glimmer of light anywhere,\" he said next.\n\nHe waited with patience, and it seemed for some time that he saw no\nglimmer at all. He put out his hands on either side of him, and found\nthat, on the side of the wall against which he stood, there seemed to be\nno shelves. Perhaps the cellar had been used for other purposes than the\nstoring of wine, and, if that was true, there might be somewhere some\nopening for ventilation. The air was not bad, but then the door had not\nbeen shut tightly when the man opened it.\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" he repeated. \"I shall not be afraid. In some way I\nshall get out.\"\n\nHe would not allow himself to stop and think about his father waiting\nfor his return. He knew that would only rouse his emotions and weaken\nhis courage. He began to feel his way carefully along the wall. It\nreached farther than he had thought it would.\n\nThe cellar was not so very small. He crept round it gradually, and, when\nhe had crept round it, he made his way across it, keeping his hands\nextended before him and setting down each foot cautiously. Then he sat\ndown on the stone floor and thought again, and what he thought was of\nthe things the old Buddhist had told his father, and that there was a\nway out of this place for him, and he should somehow find it, and,\nbefore too long a time had passed, be walking in the street again.\n\nIt was while he was thinking in this way that he felt a startling thing.\nIt seemed almost as if something touched him. It made him jump, though\nthe touch was so light and soft that it was scarcely a touch at all, in\nfact he could not be sure that he had not imagined it. He stood up and\nleaned against the wall again. Perhaps the suddenness of his movement\nplaced him at some angle he had not reached before, or perhaps his eyes\nhad become more completely accustomed to the darkness, for, as he turned\nhis head to listen, he made a discovery: above the door there was a\nplace where the velvet blackness was not so dense. There was something\nlike a slit in the wall, though, as it did not open upon daylight but\nupon the dark passage, it was not light it admitted so much as a lesser\nshade of darkness. But even that was better than nothing, and Marco drew\nanother long breath.\n\n\"That is only the beginning. I shall find a way out,\" he said.\n\n\"I _shall_.\"\n\nHe remembered reading a story of a man who, being shut by accident in\na safety vault, passed through such terrors before his release that he\nbelieved he had spent two days and nights in the place when he had been\nthere only a few hours.\n\n\"His thoughts did that. I must remember. I will sit down again and begin\nthinking of all the pictures in the cabinet rooms of the Art History\nMuseum in Vienna. It will take some time, and then there are the\nothers,\" he said.\n\nIt was a good plan. While he could keep his mind upon the game which had\nhelped him to pass so many dull hours, he could think of nothing else,\nas it required close attention--and perhaps, as the day went on, his\ncaptors would begin to feel that it was not safe to run the risk of\ndoing a thing as desperate as this would be. They might think better of\nit before they left the house at least. In any case, he had learned\nenough from Loristan to realize that only harm could come from letting\none's mind run wild.\n\n\"A mind is either an engine with broken and flying gear, or a giant\npower under control,\" was the thing they knew.\n\nHe had walked in imagination through three of the cabinet rooms and was\nturning mentally into a fourth, when he found himself starting again\nquite violently. This time it was not at a touch but at a sound. Surely\nit was a sound. And it was in the cellar with him. But it was the\ntiniest possible noise, a ghost of a squeak and a suggestion of a\nmovement. It came from the opposite side of the cellar, the side where\nthe shelves were. He looked across in the darkness, and in the darkness\nsaw a light which there could be no mistake about. It _was_ a light, two\nlights indeed, two round phosphorescent greenish balls. They were two\neyes staring at him. And then he heard another sound. Not a squeak this\ntime, but something so homely and comfortable that he actually burst out\nlaughing. It was a cat purring, a nice warm cat! And she was curled up\non one of the lower shelves purring to some new-born kittens. He knew\nthere were kittens because it was plain now what the tiny squeak had\nbeen, and it was made plainer by the fact that he heard another much\nmore distinct one and then another. They had all been asleep when he had\ncome into the cellar. If the mother had been awake, she had probably\nbeen very much afraid. Afterward she had perhaps come down from her\nshelf to investigate, and had passed close to him. The feeling of relief\nwhich came upon him at this queer and simple discovery was wonderful. It\nwas so natural and comfortable an every-day thing that it seemed to make\nspies and criminals unreal, and only natural things possible. With a\nmother cat purring away among her kittens, even a dark wine-cellar was\nnot so black. He got up and kneeled by the shelf. The greenish eyes did\nnot shine in an unfriendly way. He could feel that the owner of them was\na nice big cat, and he counted four round little balls of kittens. It\nwas a curious delight to stroke the soft fur and talk to the mother cat.\nShe answered with purring, as if she liked the sense of friendly human\nnearness. Marco laughed to himself.\n\n\n\n\"It's queer what a difference it makes!\" he said. \"It is almost like\nfinding a window.\"\n\nThe mere presence of these harmless living things was companionship. He\nsat down close to the low shelf and listened to the motherly purring,\nnow and then speaking and putting out his hand to touch the warm fur.\nThe phosphorescent light in the green eyes was a comfort in itself.\n\n\"We shall get out of this--both of us,\" he said. \"We shall not be here\nvery long, Puss-cat.\"\n\nHe was not troubled by the fear of being really hungry for some time. He\nwas so used to eating scantily from necessity, and to passing long hours\nwithout food during his journeys, that he had proved to himself that\nfasting is not, after all, such a desperate ordeal as most people\nimagine. If you begin by expecting to feel famished and by counting the\nhours between your meals, you will begin to be ravenous. But he knew\nbetter.\n\nThe time passed slowly; but he had known it would pass slowly, and he\nhad made up his mind not to watch it nor ask himself questions about it.\nHe was not a restless boy, but, like his father, could stand or sit or\nlie still. Now and then he could hear distant rumblings of carts and\nvans passing in the street. There was a certain degree of companionship\nin these also. He kept his place near the cat and his hand where he\ncould occasionally touch her. He could lift his eyes now and then to the\nplace where the dim glimmer of something like light showed itself.\n\nPerhaps the stillness, perhaps the darkness, perhaps the purring of the\nmother cat, probably all three, caused his thoughts to begin to travel\nthrough his mind slowly and more slowly. At last they ceased and he fell\nasleep. The mother cat purred for some time, and then fell asleep\nherself.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nA SOUND IN A DREAM\n\n\nMarco slept peacefully for several hours. There was nothing to awaken\nhim during that time. But at the end of it, his sleep was penetrated by\na definite sound. He had dreamed of hearing a voice at a distance, and,\nas he tried in his dream to hear what it said, a brief metallic ringing\nsound awakened him outright. It was over by the time he was fully\nconscious, and at once he realized that the voice of his dream had been\na real one, and was speaking still. It was the Lovely Person's voice,\nand she was speaking rapidly, as if she were in the greatest haste. She\nwas speaking through the door.\n\n\"You will have to search for it,\" was all he heard. \"I have not a\nmoment!\" And, as he listened to her hurriedly departing feet, there came\nto him with their hastening echoes the words, \"You are too good for the\ncellar. I like you!\"\n\nHe sprang to the door and tried it, but it was still locked. The feet\nran up the cellar steps and through the upper hall, and the front door\nclosed with a bang. The two people had gone away, as they had\nthreatened. The voice had been excited as well as hurried. Something had\nhappened to frighten them, and they had left the house in great haste.\n\nMarco turned and stood with his back against the door. The cat had\nawakened and she was gazing at him with her green eyes. She began to\npurr encouragingly. She really helped Marco to think. He was thinking\nwith all his might and trying to remember.\n\n\"What did she come for? She came for something,\" he said to himself.\n\"What did she say? I only heard part of it, because I was asleep. The\nvoice in the dream was part of it. The part I heard was, 'You will have\nto search for it. I have not a moment.' And as she ran down the passage,\nshe called back, 'You are too good for the cellar. I like you.'\" He\nsaid the words over and over again and tried to recall exactly how they\nhad sounded, and also to recall the voice which had seemed to be part of\na dream but had been a real thing. Then he began to try his favorite\nexperiment. As he often tried the experiment of commanding his mind to\ngo to sleep, so he frequently experimented on commanding it to work for\nhim--to help him to remember, to understand, and to argue about things\nclearly.\n\n\"Reason this out for me,\" he said to it now, quite naturally and calmly.\n\"Show me what it means.\"\n\nWhat did she come for? It was certain that she was in too great a hurry\nto be able, without a reason, to spare the time to come. What was the\nreason? She had said she liked him. Then she came because she liked him.\nIf she liked him, she came to do something which was not unfriendly. The\nonly good thing she could do for him was something which would help him\nto get out of the cellar. She had said twice that he was too good for\nthe cellar. If he had been awake, he would have heard all she said and\nhave understood what she wanted him to do or meant to do for him. He\nmust not stop even to think of that. The first words he had heard--what\nhad they been? They had been less clear to him than her last because he\nhad heard them only as he was awakening. But he thought he was sure that\nthey had been, \"You will have to search for it.\" Search for it. For\nwhat? He thought and thought. What must he search for?\n\nHe sat down on the floor of the cellar and held his head in his hands,\npressing his eyes so hard that curious lights floated before them.\n\n\"Tell me! Tell me!\" he said to that part of his being which the Buddhist\nanchorite had said held all knowledge and could tell a man everything if\nhe called upon it in the right spirit.\n\nAnd in a few minutes, he recalled something which seemed so much a part\nof his sleep that he had not been sure that he had not dreamed it. The\nringing sound! He sprang up on his feet with a little gasping shout.\nThe ringing sound! It had been the ring of metal, striking as it fell.\nAnything made of metal might have sounded like that. She had thrown\nsomething made of metal into the cellar. She had thrown it through the\nslit in the bricks near the door. She liked him, and said he was too\ngood for his prison. She had thrown to him the only thing which could\nset him free. She had thrown him the _key_ of the cellar!\n\nFor a few minutes the feelings which surged through him were so full of\nstrong excitement that they set his brain in a whirl. He knew what his\nfather would say--that would not do. If he was to think, he must hold\nhimself still and not let even joy overcome him. The key was in the\nblack little cellar, and he must find it in the dark. Even the woman who\nliked him enough to give him a chance of freedom knew that she must not\nopen the door and let him out. There must be a delay. He would have to\nfind the key himself, and it would be sure to take time. The chances\nwere that they would be at a safe enough distance before he could get\nout.\n\n\"I will kneel down and crawl on my hands and knees,\" he said.\n\n\"I will crawl back and forth and go over every inch of the floor with my\nhands until I find it. If I go over every inch, I shall find it.\"\n\nSo he kneeled down and began to crawl, and the cat watched him and\npurred.\n\n\"We shall get out, Puss-cat,\" he said to her. \"I told you we should.\"\n\nHe crawled from the door to the wall at the side of the shelves, and\nthen he crawled back again. The key might be quite a small one, and it\nwas necessary that he should pass his hands over every inch, as he had\nsaid. The difficulty was to be sure, in the darkness, that he did not\nmiss an inch. Sometimes he was not sure enough, and then he went over\nthe ground again. He crawled backward and forward, and he crawled\nforward and backward. He crawled crosswise and lengthwise, he crawled\ndiagonally, and he crawled round and round. But he did not find the key.\nIf he had had only a little light, but he had none. He was so absorbed\nin his search that he did not know he had been engaged in it for several\nhours, and that it was the middle of the night. But at last he realized\nthat he must stop for a rest, because his knees were beginning to feel\nbruised, and the skin of his hands was sore as a result of the rubbing\non the flags. The cat and her kittens had gone to sleep and awakened\nagain two or three times.\n\n\"But it is somewhere!\" he said obstinately. \"It is inside the cellar. I\nheard something fall which was made of metal. That was the ringing sound\nwhich awakened me.\"\n\nWhen he stood up, he found his body ached and he was very tired. He\nstretched himself and exercised his arms and legs.\n\n\"I wonder how long I have been crawling about,\" he thought. \"But the key\nis in the cellar. It is in the cellar.\"\n\nHe sat down near the cat and her family, and, laying his arm on the\nshelf above her, rested his head on it. He began to think of another\nexperiment.\n\n\"I am so tired, I believe I shall go to sleep again. 'Thought which\nKnows All' \"--he was quoting something the hermit had said to Loristan\nin their midnight talk--\"Thought which Knows All! Show me this little\nthing. Lead me to it when I awake.\"\n\nAnd he did fall asleep, sound and fast.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe did not know that he slept all the rest of the night. But he did.\nWhen he awakened, it was daylight in the streets, and the milk-carts\nwere beginning to jingle about, and the early postmen were knocking big\ndouble-knocks at front doors. The cat may have heard the milk-carts, but\nthe actual fact was that she herself was hungry and wanted to go in\nsearch of food. Just as Marco lifted his head from his arm and sat up,\nshe jumped down from her shelf and went to the door. She had expected to\nfind it ajar as it had been before. When she found it shut, she\nscratched at it and was disturbed to find this of no use. Because she\nknew Marco was in the cellar, she felt she had a friend who would assist\nher, and she miaued appealingly.\n\nThis reminded Marco of the key.\n\n\"I will when I have found it,\" he said. \"It is inside the cellar.\"\n\nThe cat miaued again, this time very anxiously indeed. The kittens\nheard her and began to squirm and squeak piteously.\n\n\"Lead me to this little thing,\" said Marco, as if speaking to something\nin the darkness about him, and he got up.\n\nHe put his hand out toward the kittens, and it touched something lying\nnot far from them. It must have been lying near his elbow all night\nwhile he slept.\n\nIt was the key! It had fallen upon the shelf, and not on the floor at\nall.\n\nMarco picked it up and then stood still a moment. He made the sign of\nthe cross.\n\nThen he found his way to the door and fumbled until he found the keyhole\nand got the key into it. Then he turned it and pushed the door open--and\nthe cat ran out into the passage before him.\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nTHE RAT TO THE RESCUE\n\n\nMarco walked through the passage and into the kitchen part of the\nbasement. The doors were all locked, and they were solid doors. He ran\nup the flagged steps and found the door at the top shut and bolted also,\nand that too was a solid door. His jailers had plainly made sure that it\nshould take time enough for him to make his way into the world, even\nafter he got out of the wine-cellar.\n\nThe cat had run away to some part of the place where mice were\nplentiful. Marco was by this time rather gnawingly hungry himself. If he\ncould get into the kitchen, he might find some fragments of food left in\na cupboard; but there was no moving the locked door. He tried the outlet\ninto the area, but that was immovable. Then he saw near it a smaller\ndoor. It was evidently the entrance to the coal-cellar under the\npavement. This was proved by the fact that trodden coal-dust marked the\nflagstones, and near it stood a scuttle with coal in it.\n\nThis coal-scuttle was the thing which might help him! Above the area\ndoor was a small window which was supposed to light the entry. He could\nnot reach it, and, if he reached it, he could not open it. He could\nthrow pieces of coal at the glass and break it, and then he could shout\nfor help when people passed by. They might not notice or understand\nwhere the shouts came from at first, but, if he kept them up, some one's\nattention would be attracted in the end.\n\nHe picked a large-sized solid piece of coal out of the heap in the\nscuttle, and threw it with all his force against the grimy glass. It\nsmashed through and left a big hole. He threw another, and the entire\npane was splintered and fell outside into the area. Then he saw it was\nbroad daylight, and guessed that he had been shut up a good many hours.\nThere was plenty of coal in the scuttle, and he had a strong arm and a\ngood aim. He smashed pane after pane, until only the framework remained.\nWhen he shouted, there would be nothing between his voice and the\nstreet. No one could see him, but if he could do something which would\nmake people slacken their pace to listen, then he could call out that he\nwas in the basement of the house with the broken window.\n\n\"Hallo!\" he shouted. \"Hallo! Hallo! Hallo! Hallo!\"\n\nBut vehicles were passing in the street, and the passers-by were\nabsorbed in their own business. If they heard a sound, they did not stop\nto inquire into it.\n\n\"Hallo! Hallo! I am locked in!\" yelled Marco, at the topmost power of\nhis lungs. \"Hallo! Hallo!\"\n\nAfter half an hour's shouting, he began to think that he was wasting his\nstrength.\n\n\"They only think it is a boy shouting,\" he said. \"Some one will notice\nin time. At night, when the streets are quiet, I might make a policeman\nhear. But my father does not know where I am. He will be trying to find\nme--so will Lazarus--so will The Rat. One of them might pass through\nthis very street, as I did. What can I do!\"\n\nA new idea flashed light upon him.\n\n\"I will begin to sing a Samavian song, and I will sing it very loud.\nPeople nearly always stop a moment to listen to music and find out where\nit comes from. And if any of my own people came near, they would stop at\nonce--and now and then I will shout for help.\"\n\nOnce when they had stopped to rest on Hampstead Heath, he had sung a\nvaliant Samavian song for The Rat. The Rat had wanted to hear how he\nwould sing when they went on their secret journey. He wanted him to sing\nfor the Squad some day, to make the thing seem real. The Rat had been\ngreatly excited, and had begged for the song often. It was a stirring\nmartial thing with a sort of trumpet call of a chorus. Thousands of\nSamavians had sung it together on their way to the battle-field,\nhundreds of years ago.\n\nHe drew back a step or so, and, putting his hands on his hips, began to\nsing, throwing his voice upward that it might pass through the broken\nwindow. He had a splendid and vibrant young voice, though he knew\nnothing of its fine quality. Just now he wanted only to make it loud.\n\nIn the street outside very few people were passing. An irritable old\ngentleman who was taking an invalid walk quite jumped with annoyance\nwhen the song suddenly trumpeted forth. Boys had no right to yell in\nthat manner. He hurried his step to get away from the sound. Two or\nthree other people glanced over their shoulders, but had not time to\nloiter. A few others listened with pleasure as they drew near and passed\non.\n\n\"There's a boy with a fine voice,\" said one.\n\n\"What's he singing?\" said his companion. \"It sounds foreign.\"\n\n\"Don't know,\" was the reply as they went by. But at last a young man who\nwas a music-teacher, going to give a lesson, hesitated and looked about\nhim. The song was very loud and spirited just at this moment. The\nmusic-teacher could not understand where it came from, and paused to\nfind out. The fact that he stopped attracted the attention of the next\ncomer, who also paused.\n\n\"Who's singing?\" he asked. \"Where is he singing?\"\n\n\"I can't make out,\" the music-teacher laughed. \"Sounds as if it came out\nof the ground.\"\n\nAnd, because it was queer that a song should seem to be coming out of\nthe ground, a costermonger stopped, and then a little boy, and then a\nworkingwoman, and then a lady.\n\nThere was quite a little group when another person turned the corner of\nthe street. He was a shabby boy on crutches, and he had a frantic look\non his face.\n\nAnd Marco actually heard, as he drew near to the group, the tap-tap-tap\nof crutches.\n\n\"It might be,\" he thought. \"It might be!\"\n\nAnd he sang the trumpet-call of the chorus as if it were meant to reach\nthe skies, and he sang it again and again. And at the end of it shouted,\n\"Hallo! Hallo! Hallo! Hallo! Hallo!\"\n\n[Illustration: The Rat swung himself into the group. \"Where is he!\"\n\"Where is he!\" he cried.]\n\nThe Rat swung himself into the group and looked as if he had gone crazy.\nHe hurled himself against the people.\n\n\"Where is he! Where is he!\" he cried, and he poured out some breathless\nwords; it was almost as if he sobbed them out.\n\n\"We've been looking for him all night!\" he shouted. \"Where is he! Marco!\nMarco! No one else sings it but him. Marco! Marco!\" And out of the area,\nas it seemed, came a shout of answer.\n\n\"Rat! Rat! I'm here in the cellar--locked in. I'm here!\" and a big piece\nof coal came hurtling through the broken window and fell crashing on the\narea flags. The Rat got down the steps into the area as if he had not\nbeen on crutches but on legs, and banged on the door, shouting back:\n\n\"Marco! Marco! Here I am! Who locked you in? How can I get the door\nopen?\"\n\nMarco was close against the door inside. It was The Rat! It was\nThe Rat! And he would be in the street again in a few minutes. \"Call a\npoliceman!\" he shouted through the keyhole. \"The people locked me in on\npurpose and took away the keys.\"\n\nThen the group of lookers-on began to get excited and press against the\narea railings and ask questions. They could not understand what had\nhappened to cause the boy with the crutches to look as if he were crazy\nwith terror and relief at the same time.\n\nAnd the little boy ran delightedly to fetch a policeman, and found one\nin the next street, and, with some difficulty, persuaded him that it was\nhis business to come and get a door open in an empty house where a boy\nwho was a street singer had got locked up in a cellar.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\n\"IT IS A VERY BAD SIGN\"\n\n\nThe policeman was not so much excited as out of temper. He did not know\nwhat Marco knew or what The Rat knew. Some common lad had got himself\nlocked up in a house, and some one would have to go to the landlord and\nget a key from him. He had no intention of laying himself open to the\nlaw by breaking into a private house with his truncheon, as The Rat\nexpected him to do.\n\n\"He got himself in through some of his larks, and he'll have to wait\ntill he's got out without smashing locks,\" he growled, shaking the area\ndoor. \"How did you get in there?\" he shouted.\n\nIt was not easy for Marco to explain through a keyhole that he had come\nin to help a lady who had met with an accident. The policeman thought\nthis mere boy's talk. As to the rest of the story, Marco knew that it\ncould not be related at all without saying things which could not be\nexplained to any one but his father. He quickly made up his mind that\nhe must let it be believed that he had been locked in by some queer\naccident. It must be supposed that the people had not remembered, in\ntheir haste, that he had not yet left the house.\n\nWhen the young clerk from the house agency came with the keys, he was\nmuch disturbed and bewildered after he got inside.\n\n\"They've made a bolt of it,\" he said. \"That happens now and then, but\nthere's something queer about this. What did they lock these doors in\nthe basement for, and the one on the stairs? What did they say to you?\"\nhe asked Marco, staring at him suspiciously.\n\n\"They said they were obliged to go suddenly,\" Marco answered.\n\n\"What were you doing in the basement?\"\n\n\"The man took me down.\"\n\n\"And left you there and bolted? He must have been in a hurry.\"\n\n\"The lady said they had not a moment's time.\"\n\n\"Her ankle must have got well in short order,\" said the young man.\n\n\"I knew nothing about them,\" answered Marco. \"I had never seen them\nbefore.\"\n\n\"The police were after them,\" the young man said. \"That's what I should\nsay. They paid three months' rent in advance, and they have only been\nhere two. Some of these foreign spies lurking about London; that's what\nthey were.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe Rat had not waited until the keys arrived. He had swung himself at\nhis swiftest pace back through the streets to No. 7 Philibert Place.\nPeople turned and stared at his wild pale face as he almost shot past\nthem.\n\nHe had left himself barely breath enough to speak with when he reached\nthe house and banged on the door with his crutch to save time.\n\nBoth Loristan and Lazarus came to answer.\n\nThe Rat leaned against the door gasping.\n\n\"He's found! He's all right!\" he panted. \"Some one had locked him in a\nhouse and left him. They've sent for the keys. I'm going back. Brandon\nTerrace, No. 10.\"\n\nLoristan and Lazarus exchanged glances. Both of them were at the moment\nas pale as The Rat.\n\n\"Help him into the house,\" said Loristan to Lazarus. \"He must stay here\nand rest. We will go.\" The Rat knew it was an order.\n\nHe did not like it, but he obeyed.\n\n\"This is a bad sign, Master,\" said Lazarus, as they went out together.\n\n\"It is a very bad one,\" answered Loristan.\n\n\"God of the Right, defend us!\" Lazarus groaned.\n\n\"Amen!\" said Loristan. \"Amen!\"\n\nThe group had become a small crowd by the time they reached Brandon\nTerrace. Marco had not found it easy to leave the place because he was\nbeing questioned. Neither the policeman nor the agent's clerk seemed\nwilling to relinquish the idea that he could give them some information\nabout the absconding pair.\n\nThe entrance of Loristan produced its usual effect. The agent's clerk\nlifted his hat, and the policeman stood straight and made salute.\nNeither of them realized that the tall man's clothes were worn and\nthreadbare. They felt only that a personage was before them, and that it\nwas not possible to question his air of absolute and serene authority.\nHe laid his hand on Marco's shoulder and held it there as he spoke. When\nMarco looked up at him and felt the closeness of his touch, it seemed as\nif it were an embrace--as if he had caught him to his breast.\n\n\"My boy knew nothing of these people,\" he said. \"That I can guarantee.\nHe had seen neither of them before. His entering the house was the\nresult of no boyish trick. He has been shut up in this place for nearly\ntwenty-four hours and has had no food. I must take him home. This is my\naddress.\" He handed the young man a card.\n\nThen they went home together, and all the way to Philibert Place\nLoristan's firm hand held closely to his boy's shoulder as if he could\nnot endure to let him go. But on the way they said very little.\n\n\"Father,\" Marco said, rather hoarsely, when they first got away from the\nhouse in the terrace, \"I can't talk well in the street. For one thing, I\nam so glad to be with you again. It seemed as if--it might turn out\nbadly.\"\n\n\"Beloved one,\" Loristan said the words in their own Samavian, \"until you\nare fed and at rest, you shall not talk at all.\"\n\nAfterward, when he was himself again and was allowed to tell his strange\nstory, Marco found that both his father and Lazarus had at once had\nsuspicions when he had not returned. They knew no ordinary event could\nhave kept him. They were sure that he must have been detained against\nhis will, and they were also sure that, if he had been so detained, it\ncould only have been for reasons they could guess at.\n\n\"This was the card that she gave me,\" Marco said, and he handed it to\nLoristan. \"She said you would remember the name.\" Loristan looked at the\nlettering with an ironic half-smile.\n\n\"I never heard it before,\" he replied. \"She would not send me a name I\nknew. Probably I have never seen either of them. But I know the work\nthey do. They are spies of the Maranovitch, and suspect that I know\nsomething of the Lost Prince. They believed they could terrify you into\nsaying things which would be a clue. Men and women of their class will\nuse desperate means to gain their end.\"\n\n\"Might they--have left me as they threatened?\" Marco asked him.\n\n\"They would scarcely have dared, I think. Too great a hue and cry would\nhave been raised by the discovery of such a crime. Too many detectives\nwould have been set at work to track them.\"\n\nBut the look in his father's eyes as he spoke, and the pressure of the\nhand he stretched out to touch him, made Marco's heart thrill. He had\nwon a new love and trust from his father. When they sat together and\ntalked that night, they were closer to each other's souls than they had\never been before.\n\nThey sat in the firelight, Marco upon the worn hearth-rug, and they\ntalked about Samavia--about the war and its heart-rending struggles, and\nabout how they might end.\n\n\"Do you think that some time we might be exiles no longer?\" the boy said\nwistfully. \"Do you think we might go there together--and see it--you\nand I, Father?\"\n\nThere was a silence for a while. Loristan looked into the sinking bed of\nred coal.\n\n\"For years--for years I have made for my soul that image,\" he said\nslowly. \"When I think of my friend on the side of the Himalayan\nMountains, I say, 'The Thought which Thought the World may give us that\nalso!'\"\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\n\"CITIES AND FACES\"\n\n\nThe hours of Marco's unexplained absence had been terrible to Loristan\nand to Lazarus. They had reason for fears which it was not possible for\nthem to express. As the night drew on, the fears took stronger form.\nThey forgot the existence of The Rat, who sat biting his nails in the\nbedroom, afraid to go out lest he might lose the chance of being given\nsome errand to do but also afraid to show himself lest he should seem in\nthe way.\n\n\"I'll stay upstairs,\" he had said to Lazarus. \"If you just whistle, I'll\ncome.\"\n\nThe anguish he passed through as the day went by and Lazarus went out\nand came in and he himself received no orders, could not have been\nexpressed in any ordinary words. He writhed in his chair, he bit his\nnails to the quick, he wrought himself into a frenzy of misery and\nterror by recalling one by one all the crimes his knowledge of London\npolice-courts supplied him with. He was doing nothing, yet he dare not\nleave his post. It was his post after all, though they had not given it\nto him. He must do something.\n\nIn the middle of the night Loristan opened the door of the back\nsitting-room, because he knew he must at least go upstairs and throw\nhimself upon his bed even if he could not sleep.\n\nHe started back as the door opened. The Rat was sitting huddled on the\nfloor near it with his back against the wall. He had a piece of paper in\nhis hand and his twisted face was a weird thing to see.\n\n\"Why are you here?\" Loristan asked.\n\n\"I've been here three hours, sir. I knew you'd have to come out sometime\nand I thought you'd let me speak to you. Will you--will you?\"\n\n\"Come into the room,\" said Loristan. \"I will listen to anything you want\nto say. What have you been drawing on that paper?\" as The Rat got up in\nthe wonderful way he had taught himself. The paper was covered with\nlines which showed it to be another of his plans.\n\n\"Please look at it,\" he begged. \"I daren't go out lest you might want to\nsend me somewhere. I daren't sit doing nothing. I began remembering and\nthinking things out. I put down all the streets and squares he _might_\nhave walked through on his way home. I've not missed one. If you'll\nlet me start out and walk through every one of them and talk to the\npolicemen on the beat and look at the houses--and think out things\nand work at them--I'll not miss an inch--I'll not miss a brick or a\nflagstone--I'll--\" His voice had a hard sound but it shook, and he\nhimself shook.\n\nLoristan touched his arm gently.\n\n\"You are a good comrade,\" he said. \"It is well for us that you are here.\nYou have thought of a good thing.\"\n\n\"May I go now?\" said The Rat.\n\n\"This moment, if you are ready,\" was the answer. The Rat swung himself\nto the door.\n\nLoristan said to him a thing which was like the sudden lighting of a\ngreat light in the very center of his being.\n\n\"You are one of us. Now that I know you are doing this I may even sleep.\nYou are one of us.\" And it was because he was following this plan that\nThe Rat had turned into Brandon Terrace and heard the Samavian song\nringing out from the locked basement of Number 10.\n\n\"Yes, he is one of us,\" Loristan said, when he told this part of the\nstory to Marco as they sat by the fire. \"I had not been sure before.\nI wanted to be very sure. Last night I saw into the depths of him and\n_knew_. He may be trusted.\"\n\nFrom that day The Rat held a new place. Lazarus himself, strangely\nenough, did not resent his holding it. The boy was allowed to be near\nLoristan as he had never dared to hope to be near. It was not merely\nthat he was allowed to serve him in many ways, but he was taken into the\nintimacy which had before enclosed only the three. Loristan talked to\nhim as he talked to Marco, drawing him within the circle which held so\nmuch that was comprehended without speech. The Rat knew that he was\nbeing trained and observed and he realized it with exaltation. His idol\nhad said that he was \"one of them\" and he was watching and putting him\nto tests so that he might find out how much he was one of them. And he\nwas doing it for some grave reason of his own. This thought possessed\nThe Rat's whole mind. Perhaps he was wondering if he should find out\nthat he was to be trusted, as a rock is to be trusted. That he should\neven think that perhaps he might find that he was like a rock, was\ninspiration enough.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said one night when they were alone together, because The Rat\nhad been copying a road-map. His voice was very low--\"do you think\nthat--sometime--you could trust me as you trust Marco? Could it ever be\nlike that--ever?\"\n\n\"The time has come,\" and Loristan's voice was almost as low as his own,\nthough strong and deep feeling underlay its quiet--\"the time has come\nwhen I can trust you with Marco--to be his companion--to care for him,\nto stand by his side at any moment. And Marco is--Marco is my son.\" That\nwas enough to uplift The Rat to the skies. But there was more to follow.\n\n\"It may not be long before it may be his part to do work in which he\nwill need a comrade who can be trusted--as a rock can be trusted.\"\n\nHe had said the very words The Rat's own mind had given to him.\n\n\"A Rock! A Rock!\" the boy broke out. \"Let me show you, sir. Send me with\nhim for a servant. The crutches are nothing. You've seen that they're as\ngood as legs, haven't you? I've trained myself.\"\n\n\"I know, I know, dear lad.\" Marco had told him all of it. He gave him a\ngracious smile which seemed as if it held a sort of fine secret. \"You\nshall go as his aide-de-camp. It shall be part of the game.\"\n\nHe had always encouraged \"the game,\" and during the last weeks had even\nfound time to help them in their plannings for the mysterious journey\nof the Secret Two. He had been so interested that once or twice he had\ncalled on Lazarus as an old soldier and Samavian to give his opinions\nof certain routes--and of the customs and habits of people in towns\nand villages by the way. Here they would find simple pastoral folk who\ndanced, sang after their day's work, and who would tell all they knew;\nhere they would find those who served or feared the Maranovitch and who\nwould not talk at all. In one place they would meet with hospitality,\nin another with unfriendly suspicion of all strangers. Through talk and\nstories The Rat began to know the country almost as Marco knew it. That\nwas part of the game too--because it was always \"the game,\" they called\nit. Another part was The Rat's training of his memory, and bringing home\nhis proofs of advance at night when he returned from his walk and could\ndescribe, or recite, or roughly sketch all he had seen in his passage\nfrom one place to another. Marco's part was to recall and sketch faces.\nLoristan one night gave him a number of photographs of people to commit\nto memory. Under each face was written the name of a place.\n\n\"Learn these faces,\" he said, \"until you would know each one of them at\nonce wheresoever you met it. Fix them upon your mind, so that it will be\nimpossible for you to forget them. You must be able to sketch any one of\nthem and recall the city or town or neighborhood connected with it.\"\n\nEven this was still called \"the game,\" but Marco began to know in his\nsecret heart that it was so much more, that his hand sometimes trembled\nwith excitement as he made his sketches over and over again. To make\neach one many times was the best way to imbed it in his memory. The Rat\nknew, too, though he had no reason for knowing, but mere instinct. He\nused to lie awake in the night and think it over and remember what\nLoristan had said of the time coming when Marco might need a comrade in\nhis work. What was his work to be? It was to be something like \"the\ngame.\" And they were being prepared for it. And though Marco often lay\nawake on his bed when The Rat lay awake on his sofa, neither boy spoke\nto the other of the thing his mind dwelt on. And Marco worked as he had\nnever worked before. The game was very exciting when he could prove his\nprowess. The four gathered together at night in the back sitting-room.\nLazarus was obliged to be with them because a second judge was needed.\nLoristan would mention the name of a place, perhaps a street in Paris or\na hotel in Vienna, and Marco would at once make a rapid sketch of the\nface under whose photograph the name of the locality had been written.\nIt was not long before he could begin his sketch without more than a\nmoment's hesitation. And yet even when this had become the case, they\nstill played the game night after night. There was a great hotel near\nthe Place de la Concorde in Paris, of which Marco felt he should never\nhear the name during all his life without there starting up before his\nmental vision a tall woman with fierce black eyes and a delicate\nhigh-bridged nose across which the strong eyebrows almost met. In\nVienna there was a palace which would always bring back at once a pale\ncold-faced man with a heavy blonde lock which fell over his forehead.\nA certain street in Munich meant a stout genial old aristocrat with\na sly smile; a village in Bavaria, a peasant with a vacant and simple\ncountenance. A curled and smoothed man who looked like a hair-dresser\nbrought up a place in an Austrian mountain town. He knew them all as he\nknew his own face and No. 7 Philibert Place.\n\nBut still night after night the game was played.\n\nThen came a night when, out of a deep sleep, he was awakened by Lazarus\ntouching him. He had so long been secretly ready to answer any call that\nhe sat up straight in bed at the first touch.\n\n\"Dress quickly and come down stairs,\" Lazarus said. \"The Prince is here\nand wishes to speak with you.\"\n\nMarco made no answer but got out of bed and began to slip on his\nclothes.\n\nLazarus touched The Rat.\n\nThe Rat was as ready as Marco and sat upright as he had done.\n\n\"Come down with the young Master,\" he commanded. \"It is necessary that\nyou should be seen and spoken to.\" And having given the order he went\naway.\n\nNo one heard the shoeless feet of the two boys as they stole down the\nstairs.\n\nAn elderly man in ordinary clothes, but with an unmistakable face, was\nsitting quietly talking to Loristan who with a gesture called both\nforward.\n\n\"The Prince has been much interested in what I have told him of your\ngame,\" he said in his lowest voice. \"He wishes to see you make your\nsketches, Marco.\"\n\nMarco looked very straight into the Prince's eyes which were fixed\nintently on him as he made his bow.\n\n\"His Highness does me honor,\" he said, as his father might have said it.\nHe went to the table at once and took from a drawer his pencils and\npieces of cardboard.\n\n\"I should know he was your son and a Samavian,\" the Prince remarked.\n\nThen his keen and deep-set eyes turned themselves on the boy with the\ncrutches.\n\n\"This,\" said Loristan, \"is the one who calls himself The Rat. He is one\nof us.\"\n\nThe Rat saluted.\n\n\"Please tell him, sir,\" he whispered, \"that the crutches don't matter.\"\n\n\"He has trained himself to an extraordinary activity,\" Loristan said.\n\"He can do anything.\"\n\nThe keen eyes were still taking The Rat in.\n\n\"They are an advantage,\" said the Prince at last.\n\nLazarus had nailed together a light, rough easel which Marco used in\nmaking his sketches when the game was played. Lazarus was standing in\nstate at the door, and he came forward, brought the easel from its\ncorner, and arranged the necessary drawing materials upon it.\n\nMarco stood near it and waited the pleasure of his father and his\nvisitor. They were speaking together in low tones and he waited several\nminutes. What The Rat noticed was what he had noticed before--that the\nbig boy could stand still in perfect ease and silence. It was not\nnecessary for him to say things or to ask questions--to look at people\nas if he felt restless if they did not speak to or notice him. He did\nnot seem to require notice, and The Rat felt vaguely that, young as he\nwas, this very freedom from any anxiety to be looked at or addressed\nmade him somehow look like a great gentleman.\n\nLoristan and the Prince advanced to where he stood.\n\n\"L'Hotel de Marigny,\" Loristan said.\n\nMarco began to sketch rapidly. He began the portrait of the handsome\nwoman with the delicate high-bridged nose and the black brows which\nalmost met. As he did it, the Prince drew nearer and watched the work\nover his shoulder. It did not take very long and, when it was finished,\nthe inspector turned, and after giving Loristan a long and strange look,\nnodded twice.\n\n\"It is a remarkable thing,\" he said. \"In that rough sketch she is not to\nbe mistaken.\"\n\nLoristan bent his head.\n\nThen he mentioned the name of another street in another place--and\nMarco sketched again. This time it was the peasant with the simple face.\nThe Prince bowed again. Then Loristan gave another name, and after that\nanother and another; and Marco did his work until it was at an end, and\nLazarus stood near with a handful of sketches which he had silently\ntaken charge of as each was laid aside.\n\n\"You would know these faces wheresoever you saw them?\" said the Prince.\n\"If you passed one in Bond Street or in the Marylebone Road, you would\nrecognize it at once?\"\n\n\"As I know yours, sir,\" Marco answered.\n\nThen followed a number of questions. Loristan asked them as he had often\nasked them before. They were questions as to the height and build of the\noriginals of the pictures, of the color of their hair and eyes, and the\norder of their complexions. Marco answered them all. He knew all but the\nnames of these people, and it was plainly not necessary that he should\nknow them, as his father had never uttered them.\n\nAfter this questioning was at an end the Prince pointed to The Rat who\nhad leaned on his crutches against the wall, his eyes fiercely eager\nlike a ferret's.\n\n\"And he?\" the Prince said. \"What can he do?\"\n\n\"Let me try,\" said The Rat. \"Marco knows.\"\n\nMarco looked at his father.\n\n\"May I help him to show you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Loristan answered, and then, as he turned to the Prince, he said\nagain in his low voice: \"_he is one of us_.\"\n\nThen Marco began a new form of the game. He held up one of the pictured\nfaces before The Rat, and The Rat named at once the city and place\nconnected with it, he detailed the color of eyes and hair, the height,\nthe build, all the personal details as Marco himself had detailed them.\nTo these he added descriptions of the cities, and points concerning the\npolice system, the palaces, the people. His face twisted itself, his\neyes burned, his voice shook, but he was amazing in his readiness of\nreply and his exactness of memory.\n\n\"I can't draw,\" he said at the end. \"But I can remember. I didn't want\nany one to be bothered with thinking I was trying to learn it. So only\nMarco knew.\"\n\nThis he said to Loristan with appeal in his voice.\n\n\"It was he who invented 'the game,'\" said Loristan. \"I showed you his\nstrange maps and plans.\"\n\n\"It is a good game,\" the Prince answered in the manner of a man\nextraordinarily interested and impressed. \"They know it well. They can\nbe trusted.\"\n\n\"No such thing has ever been done before,\" Loristan said. \"It is as new\nas it is daring and simple.\"\n\n\"Therein lies its safety,\" the Prince answered.\n\n\"Perhaps only boyhood,\" said Loristan, \"could have dared to imagine it.\"\n\n\"The Prince thanks you,\" he said after a few more words spoken aside to\nhis visitor. \"We both thank you. You may go back to your beds.\"\n\nAnd the boys went.\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\"THAT IS ONE!\"\n\n\nA week had not passed before Marco brought to The Rat in their bedroom\nan envelope containing a number of slips of paper on each of which was\nwritten something.\n\n\"This is another part of the game,\" he said gravely. \"Let us sit down\ntogether by the table and study it.\"\n\nThey sat down and examined what was written on the slips. At the head of\neach was the name of one of the places with which Marco had connected a\nface he had sketched. Below were clear and concise directions as to how\nit was to be reached and the words to be said when each individual was\nencountered.\n\n\"This person is to be found at his stall in the market,\" was written of\nthe vacant-faced peasant. \"You will first attract his attention by\nasking the price of something. When he is looking at you, touch your\nleft thumb lightly with the forefinger of your right hand. Then utter in\na low distinct tone the words 'The Lamp is lighted.' That is all you are\nto do.\"\n\nSometimes the directions were not quite so simple, but they were all\ninstructions of the same order. The originals of the sketches were to be\nsought out--always with precaution which should conceal that they were\nbeing sought at all, and always in such a manner as would cause an\nencounter to appear to be mere chance. Then certain words were to be\nuttered, but always without attracting the attention of any bystander or\npasser-by.\n\nThe boys worked at their task through the entire day. They concentrated\nall their powers upon it. They wrote and re-wrote--they repeated to\neach other what they committed to memory as if it were a lesson. Marco\nworked with the greater ease and more rapidly, because exercise of this\norder had been his practice and entertainment from his babyhood. The\nRat, however, almost kept pace with him, as he had been born with a\nphenomenal memory and his eagerness and desire were a fury.\n\nBut throughout the entire day neither of them once referred to what they\nwere doing as anything but \"the game.\"\n\nAt night, it is true, each found himself lying awake and thinking. It\nwas The Rat who broke the silence from his sofa.\n\n\"It is what the messengers of the Secret Party would be ordered to do\nwhen they were sent out to give the Sign for the Rising,\" he said.\n\"I made that up the first day I invented the party, didn't I?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Marco.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter a third day's concentration they knew by heart everything given to\nthem to learn. That night Loristan put them through an examination.\n\n\"Can you write these things?\" he asked, after each had repeated them and\nemerged safely from all cross-questioning.\n\nEach boy wrote them correctly from memory.\n\n\"Write yours in French--in German--in Russian--in Samavian,\" Loristan\nsaid to Marco.\n\n\"All you have told me to do and to learn is part of myself, Father,\"\nMarco said in the end. \"It is part of me, as if it were my hand or my\neyes--or my heart.\"\n\n\"I believe that is true,\" answered Loristan.\n\nHe was pale that night and there was a shadow on his face. His eyes held\na great longing as they rested on Marco. It was a yearning which had a\nsort of dread in it.\n\nLazarus also did not seem quite himself. He was red instead of pale, and\nhis movements were uncertain and restless. He cleared his throat\nnervously at intervals and more than once left his chair as if to look\nfor something.\n\nIt was almost midnight when Loristan, standing near Marco, put his arm\nround his shoulders.\n\n\"The Game\"--he began, and then was silent a few moments while Marco felt\nhis arm tighten its hold. Both Marco and The Rat felt a hard quick beat\nin their breasts, and, because of this and because the pause seemed\nlong, Marco spoke.\n\n\"The Game--yes, Father?\" he said.\n\n\"The Game is about to give you work to do--both of you,\" Loristan\nanswered.\n\nLazarus cleared his throat and walked to the easel in the corner of the\nroom. But he only changed the position of a piece of drawing-paper on\nit and then came back.\n\n\"In two days you are to go to Paris--as you,\" to The Rat, \"planned in\nthe game.\"\n\n\"As I planned?\" The Rat barely breathed the words.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Loristan. \"The instructions you have learned you will\ncarry out. There is no more to be done than to manage to approach\ncertain persons closely enough to be able to utter certain words to\nthem.\"\n\n\"Only two young strollers whom no man could suspect,\" put in Lazarus\nin an astonishingly rough and shaky voice. \"They could pass near the\nEmperor himself without danger. The young Master--\" his voice became so\nhoarse that he was obligated to clear it loudly--\"the young Master must\ncarry himself less finely. It would be well to shuffle a little and\nslouch as if he were of the common people.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said The Rat hastily. \"He must do that. I can teach him. He holds\nhis head and his shoulders like a gentleman. He must look like a street\nlad.\"\n\n\"I will look like one,\" said Marco, with determination.\n\n\"I will trust you to remind him,\" Loristan said to The Rat, and he said\nit with gravity. \"That will be your charge.\"\n\nAs he lay upon his pillow that night, it seemed to Marco as if a load\nhad lifted itself from his heart. It was the load of uncertainty and\nlonging. He had so long borne the pain of feeling that he was too young\nto be allowed to serve in any way. His dreams had never been wild\nones--they had in fact always been boyish and modest, howsoever\nromantic. But now no dream which could have passed through his brain\nwould have seemed so wonderful as this--that the hour had come--the hour\nhad come--and that he, Marco, was to be its messenger. He was to do no\ndramatic deed and be announced by no flourish of heralds. No one would\nknow what he did. What he achieved could only be attained if he remained\nobscure and unknown and seemed to every one only a common ordinary boy\nwho knew nothing whatever of important things. But his father had given\nto him a gift so splendid that he trembled with awe and joy as he\nthought of it. The Game had become real. He and The Rat were to carry\nwith them The Sign, and it would be like carrying a tiny lamp to set\naflame lights which would blaze from one mountain-top to another until\nhalf the world seemed on fire.\n\nAs he had awakened out of his sleep when Lazarus touched him, so he\nawakened in the middle of the night again. But he was not aroused\nby a touch. When he opened his eyes he knew it was a look which had\npenetrated his sleep--a look in the eyes of his father who was standing\nby his side. In the road outside there was the utter silence he had\nnoticed the night of the Prince's first visit--the only light was that\nof the lamp in the street, but he could see Loristan's face clearly\nenough to know that the mere intensity of his gaze had awakened him. The\nRat was sleeping profoundly. Loristan spoke in Samavian and under his\nbreath.\n\n\"Beloved one,\" he said. \"You are very young. Because I am your\nfather--just at this hour I can feel nothing else. I have trained you\nfor this through all the years of your life. I am proud of your young\nmaturity and strength but--Beloved--you are a child! Can I do this\nthing!\"\n\nFor the moment, his face and his voice were scarcely like his own.\n\nHe kneeled by the bedside, and, as he did it, Marco half sitting up\ncaught his hand and held it hard against his breast.\n\n\"Father, I know!\" he cried under his breath also. \"It is true. I am a\nchild but am I not a man also? You yourself said it. I always knew that\nyou were teaching me to be one--for some reason. It was my secret that\nI knew it. I learned well because I never forgot it. And I learned. Did\nI not?\"\n\nHe was so eager that he looked more like a boy than ever. But his young\nstrength and courage were splendid to see. Loristan knew him through and\nthrough and read every boyish thought of his.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered slowly. \"You did your part--and now if I--drew\nback--you would feel that I _had failed you--failed you_.\"\n\n\"You!\" Marco breathed it proudly. \"You _could_ not fail even the weakest\nthing in the world.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence in which the two pairs of eyes dwelt on\neach other with the deepest meaning, and then Loristan rose to his feet.\n\n\"The end will be all that our hearts most wish,\" he said. \"To-morrow\nyou may begin the new part of 'the Game.' You may go to Paris.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the train which was to meet the boat that crossed from Dover to\nCalais steamed out of the noisy Charing Cross Station, it carried in a\nthird-class carriage two shabby boys. One of them would have been a\nhandsome lad if he had not carried himself slouchingly and walked with a\nstreet lad's careless shuffling gait. The other was a cripple who moved\nslowly, and apparently with difficulty, on crutches. There was nothing\nremarkable or picturesque enough about them to attract attention. They\nsat in the corner of the carriage and neither talked much nor seemed to\nbe particularly interested in the journey or each other. When they went\non board the steamer, they were soon lost among the commoner passengers\nand in fact found for themselves a secluded place which was not\nadvantageous enough to be wanted by any one else.\n\n\"What can such a poor-looking pair of lads be going to Paris for?\" some\none asked his companion.\n\n\"Not for pleasure, certainly; perhaps to get work,\" was the casual\nanswer.\n\nIn the evening they reached Paris, and Marco led the way to a small café\nin a side-street where they got some cheap food. In the same side-street\nthey found a bed they could share for the night in a tiny room over a\nbaker's shop.\n\nThe Rat was too much excited to be ready to go to bed early. He begged\nMarco to guide him about the brilliant streets. They went slowly along\nthe broad Avenue des Champs Elysees under the lights glittering among\nthe horse-chestnut trees. The Rat's sharp eyes took it all in--the light\nof the cafés among the embowering trees, the many carriages rolling by,\nthe people who loitered and laughed or sat at little tables drinking\nwine and listening to music, the broad stream of life which flowed on to\nthe Arc de Triomphe and back again.\n\n\"It's brighter and clearer than London,\" he said to Marco. \"The people\nlook as if they were having more fun than they do in England.\"\n\nThe Place de la Concorde spreading its stately spaces--a world of\nillumination, movement, and majestic beauty--held him as though by a\nfascination. He wanted to stand and stare at it, first from one point of\nview and then from another. It was bigger and more wonderful than he had\nbeen able to picture it when Marco had described it to him and told him\nof the part it had played in the days of the French Revolution when the\nguillotine had stood in it and the tumbrils had emptied themselves at\nthe foot of its steps.\n\nHe stood near the Obelisk a long time without speaking.\n\n\"I can see it all happening,\" he said at last, and he pulled Marco away.\n\nBefore they returned home, they found their way to a large house which\nstood in a courtyard. In the iron work of the handsome gates which shut\nit in was wrought a gilded coronet. The gates were closed and the house\nwas not brightly lighted.\n\nThey walked past it and round it without speaking, but, when they neared\nthe entrance for the second time, The Rat said in a low tone:\n\n\"She is five feet seven, has black hair, a nose with a high bridge, her\neyebrows are black and almost meet across it, she has a pale olive skin\nand holds her head proudly.\"\n\n\"That is the one,\" Marco answered.\n\nThey were a week in Paris and each day passed this big house. There were\ncertain hours when great ladies were more likely to go out and come in\nthan they were at others. Marco knew this, and they managed to be within\nsight of the house or to pass it at these hours. For two days they saw\nno sign of the person they wished to see, but one morning the gates were\nthrown open and they saw flowers and palms being taken in.\n\n\"She has been away and is coming back,\" said Marco. The next day they\npassed three times--once at the hour when fashionable women drive out to\ndo their shopping, once at the time when afternoon visiting is most\nlikely to begin, and once when the streets were brilliant with lights\nand the carriages had begun to roll by to dinner-parties and theaters.\n\nThen, as they stood at a little distance from the iron gates, a carriage\ndrove through them and stopped before the big open door which was thrown\nopen by two tall footmen in splendid livery.\n\n\"She is coming out,\" said The Rat.\n\nThey would be able to see her plainly when she came, because the lights\nover the entrance were so bright.\n\nMarco slipped from under his coat sleeve a carefully made sketch.\n\nHe looked at it and The Rat looked at it.\n\nA footman stood erect on each side of the open door. The footman who sat\nwith the coachman had got down and was waiting by the carriage. Marco\nand The Rat glanced again with furtive haste at the sketch. A handsome\nwoman appeared upon the threshold. She paused and gave some order to the\nfootman who stood on the right. Then she came out in the full light and\ngot into the carriage which drove out of the courtyard and quite near\nthe place where the two boys waited.\n\nWhen it was gone, Marco drew a long breath as he tore the sketch into\nvery small pieces indeed. He did not throw them away but put them into\nhis pocket.\n\nThe Rat drew a long breath also.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said positively.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Marco.\n\nWhen they were safely shut up in their room over the baker's shop, they\ndiscussed the chances of their being able to pass her in such a way as\nwould seem accidental. Two common boys could not enter the courtyard.\nThere was a back entrance for tradespeople and messengers. When she\ndrove, she would always enter her carriage from the same place. Unless\nshe sometimes walked, they could not approach her. What should be done?\nThe thing was difficult. After they had talked some time, The Rat sat\nand gnawed his nails.\n\n\"To-morrow afternoon,\" he broke out at last, \"we'll watch and see if her\ncarriage drives in for her--then, when she comes to the door, I'll go in\nand begin to beg. The servant will think I'm a foreigner and don't know\nwhat I'm doing. You can come after me to tell me to come away, because\nyou know better than I do that I shall be ordered out. She may be a\ngood-natured woman and listen to us--and you might get near her.\"\n\n\"We might try it,\" Marco answered. \"It might work. We will try it.\"\n\nThe Rat never failed to treat him as his leader. He had begged Loristan\nto let him come with Marco as his servant, and his servant he had been\nmore than willing to be. When Loristan had said he should be his\naide-de-camp, he had felt his trust lifted to a military dignity which\nuplifted him with it. As his aide-de-camp he must serve him, watch him,\nobey his lightest wish, make everything easy for him. Sometimes, Marco\nwas troubled by the way in which he insisted on serving him, this queer,\nonce dictatorial and cantankerous lad who had begun by throwing stones\nat him.\n\n\"You must not wait on me,\" he said to him. \"I must wait upon myself.\"\n\nThe Rat rather flushed.\n\n\"He told me that he would let me come with you as your aide-de camp,\" he\nsaid. \"It--it's part of the game. It makes things easier if we keep up\nthe game.\"\n\nIt would have attracted attention if they had spent too much time in the\nvicinity of the big house. So it happened that the next afternoon the\ngreat lady evidently drove out at an hour when they were not watching\nfor her. They were on their way to try if they could carry out their\nplan, when, as they walked together along the Rue Royale, The Rat\nsuddenly touched Marco's elbow.\n\n\"The carriage stands before the shop with lace in the windows,\" he\nwhispered hurriedly.\n\nMarco saw and recognized it at once. The owner had evidently gone into\nthe shop to buy something. This was a better chance than they had hoped\nfor, and, when they approached the carriage itself, they saw that there\nwas another point in their favor. Inside were no less than three\nbeautiful little Pekingese spaniels that looked exactly alike. They were\nall trying to look out of the window and were pushing against each\nother. They were so perfect and so pretty that few people passed by\nwithout looking at them. What better excuse could two boys have for\nlingering about a place?\n\nThey stopped and, standing a little distance away, began to look at and\ndiscuss them and laugh at their excited little antics. Through the\nshop-window Marco caught a glimpse of the great lady.\n\n\"She does not look much interested. She won't stay long,\" he whispered,\nand added aloud, \"that little one is the master. See how he pushes the\nothers aside! He is stronger than the other two, though he is so small.\"\n\n\"He can snap, too,\" said The Rat.\n\n\"She is coming now,\" warned Marco, and then laughed aloud as if at the\nPekingese, which, catching sight of their mistress at the shop-door,\nbegan to leap and yelp for joy.\n\nTheir mistress herself smiled, and was smiling as Marco drew near her.\n\n\"May we look at them, Madame?\" he said in French, and, as she made an\namiable gesture of acquiescence and moved toward the carriage with him,\nhe spoke a few words, very low but very distinctly, in Russian.\n\n\"The Lamp is lighted,\" he said.\n\nThe Rat was looking at her keenly, but he did not see her face change at\nall. What he noticed most throughout their journey was that each person\nto whom they gave the Sign had complete control over his or her\ncountenance, if there were bystanders, and never betrayed by any change\nof expression that the words meant anything unusual.\n\nThe great lady merely went on smiling, and spoke only of the dogs,\nallowing Marco and himself to look at them through the window of the\ncarriage as the footman opened the door for her to enter.\n\n\"They are beautiful little creatures,\" Marco said, lifting his cap, and,\nas the footman turned away, he uttered his few Russian words once more\nand moved off without even glancing at the lady again.\n\n\"That is _one_!\" he said to The Rat that night before they went to sleep,\nand with a match he burned the scraps of the sketch he had torn and put\ninto his pocket.\n\n\n\n\nXX\n\nMARCO GOES TO THE OPERA\n\n\nTheir next journey was to Munich, but the night before they left Paris\nan unexpected thing happened.\n\nTo reach the narrow staircase which led to their bedroom it was\nnecessary to pass through the baker's shop itself.\n\nThe baker's wife was a friendly woman who liked the two boy lodgers who\nwere so quiet and gave no trouble. More than once she had given them a\nhot roll or so or a freshly baked little tartlet with fruit in the\ncenter. When Marco came in this evening, she greeted him with a nod and\nhanded him a small parcel as he passed through.\n\n\"This was left for you this afternoon,\" she said. \"I see you are making\npurchases for your journey. My man and I are very sorry you are going.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Madame. We also are sorry,\" Marco answered, taking the\nparcel. \"They are not large purchases, you see.\"\n\nBut neither he nor The Rat had bought anything at all, though the\nordinary-looking little package was plainly addressed to him and bore\nthe name of one of the big cheap shops. It felt as if it contained\nsomething soft.\n\nWhen he reached their bedroom, The Rat was gazing out of the window\nwatching every living thing which passed in the street below. He who had\nnever seen anything but London was absorbed by the spell of Paris and\nwas learning it by heart.\n\n\"Something has been sent to us. Look at this,\" said Marco.\n\nThe Rat was at his side at once. \"What is it? Where did it come from?\"\n\nThey opened the package and at first sight saw only several pairs of\nquite common woolen socks. As Marco took up the sock in the middle of\nthe parcel, he felt that there was something inside it--something laid\nflat and carefully. He put his hand in and drew out a number of\nfive-franc notes--not new ones, because new ones would have betrayed\nthemselves by crackling. These were old enough to be soft. But there\nwere enough of them to amount to a substantial sum.\n\n\"It is in small notes because poor boys would have only small ones. No\none will be surprised when we change these,\" The Rat said.\n\nEach of them believed the package had been sent by the great lady, but\nit had been done so carefully that not the slightest clue was furnished.\n\nTo The Rat, part of the deep excitement of \"the Game\" was the working\nout of the plans and methods of each person concerned. He could not have\nslept without working out some scheme which might have been used in this\ncase. It thrilled him to contemplate the difficulties the great lady\nmight have found herself obliged to overcome.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" he said, after thinking it over for some time, \"she went to a\nbig common shop dressed as if she were an ordinary woman and bought the\nsocks and pretended she was going to carry them home herself. She would\ndo that so that she could take them into some corner and slip the money\nin. Then, as she wanted to have them sent from the shop, perhaps she\nbought some other things and asked the people to deliver the packages to\ndifferent places. The socks were sent to us and the other things to some\none else. She would go to a shop where no one knew her and no one would\nexpect to see her and she would wear clothes which looked neither rich\nnor too poor.\"\n\nHe created the whole episode with all its details and explained them to\nMarco. It fascinated him for the entire evening and he felt relieved\nafter it and slept well.\n\nEven before they had left London, certain newspapers had swept out of\nexistence the story of the descendant of the Lost Prince. This had been\ndone by derision and light handling--by treating it as a romantic\nlegend.\n\nAt first, The Rat had resented this bitterly, but one day at a meal,\nwhen he had been producing arguments to prove that the story must be a\ntrue one, Loristan somehow checked him by his own silence.\n\n\"If there is such a man,\" he said after a pause, \"it is well for him\nthat his existence should not be believed in--for some time at least.\"\n\nThe Rat came to a dead stop. He felt hot for a moment and then felt\ncold. He saw a new idea all at once. He had been making a mistake in\ntactics.\n\nNo more was said but, when they were alone afterwards, he poured himself\nforth to Marco.\n\n\"I was a fool!\" he cried out. \"Why couldn't I see it for myself! Shall\nI tell you what I believe has been done? There is some one who has\ninfluence in England and who is a friend to Samavia. They've got the\nnewspapers to make fun of the story so that it won't be believed. If it\nwas believed, both the Iarovitch and the Maranovitch would be on the\nlookout, and the Secret Party would lose their chances. What a fool I\nwas not to think of it! There's some one watching and working here who\nis a friend to Samavia.\"\n\n\"But there is some one in Samavia who has begun to suspect that it might\nbe true,\" Marco answered. \"If there were not, I should not have been\nshut in the cellar. Some one thought my father knew something. The spies\nhad orders to find out what it was.\"\n\n\"Yes. Yes. That's true, too!\" The Rat answered anxiously. \"We shall have\nto be very careful.\"\n\nIn the lining of the sleeve of Marco's coat there was a slit into which\nhe could slip any small thing he wished to conceal and also wished to be\nable to reach without trouble. In this he had carried the sketch of the\nlady which he had torn up in Paris. When they walked in the streets of\nMunich, the morning after their arrival, he carried still another\nsketch. It was the one picturing the genial-looking old aristocrat with\nthe sly smile.\n\nOne of the things they had learned about this one was that his chief\ncharacteristic was his passion for music. He was a patron of musicians\nand he spent much time in Munich because he loved its musical atmosphere\nand the earnestness of its opera-goers.\n\n\"The military band plays in the Feldherrn-halle at midday. When\nsomething very good is being played, sometimes people stop their\ncarriages so that they can listen. We will go there,\" said Marco.\n\n\"It's a chance,\" said The Rat. \"We mustn't lose anything like a chance.\"\n\nThe day was brilliant and sunny, the people passing through the streets\nlooked comfortable and homely, the mixture of old streets and modern\nones, of ancient corners and shops and houses of the day was picturesque\nand cheerful. The Rat swinging through the crowd on his crutches was\nfull of interest and exhilaration. He had begun to grow, and the change\nin his face and expression which had begun in London had become more\nnoticeable. He had been given his \"place,\" and a work to do which\nentitled him to hold it.\n\nNo one could have suspected them of carrying a strange and vital secret\nwith them as they strolled along together. They seemed only two ordinary\nboys who looked in at shop windows and talked over their contents, and\nwho loitered with upturned faces in the Marien-Platz before the ornate\nGothic Rathaus to hear the eleven o'clock chimes play and see the\npainted figures of the King and Queen watch from their balcony the\npassing before them of the automatic tournament procession with its\ntrumpeters and tilting knights. When the show was over and the automatic\ncock broke forth into his lusty farewell crow, they laughed just as any\nother boys would have laughed. Sometimes it would have been easy for The\nRat to forget that there was anything graver in the world than the new\nplaces and new wonders he was seeing, as if he were a wandering minstrel\nin a story.\n\nBut in Samavia bloody battles were being fought, and bloody plans were\nbeing wrought out, and in anguished anxiety the Secret Party and the\nForgers of the Sword waited breathlessly for the Sign for which they had\nwaited so long. And inside the lining of Marco's coat was hidden the\nsketched face, as the two unnoticed lads made their way to the\nFeldherrn-halle to hear the band play and see who might chance to be\namong the audience.\n\nBecause the day was sunny, and also because the band was playing a\nspecially fine programme, the crowd in the square was larger than usual.\nSeveral vehicles had stopped, and among them were one or two which were\nnot merely hired cabs but were the carriages of private persons.\n\nOne of them had evidently arrived early, as it was drawn up in a good\nposition when the boys reached the corner. It was a big open carriage\nand a grand one, luxuriously upholstered in green. The footman and\ncoachman wore green and silver liveries and seemed to know that people\nwere looking at them and their master.\n\nHe was a stout, genial-looking old aristocrat with a sly smile, though,\nas he listened to the music, it almost forgot to be sly. In the carriage\nwith him were a young officer and a little boy, and they also listened\nattentively. Standing near the carriage door were several people who\nwere plainly friends or acquaintances, as they occasionally spoke to\nhim. Marco touched The Rat's coat sleeve as the two boys approached.\n\n\"It would not be easy to get near him,\" he said. \"Let us go and stand as\nclose to the carriage as we can get without pushing. Perhaps we may hear\nsome one say something about where he is going after the music is over.\"\n\nYes, there was no mistaking him. He was the right man. Each of them knew\nby heart the creases on his stout face and the sweep of his gray\nmoustache. But there was nothing noticeable in a boy looking for a\nmoment at a piece of paper, and Marco sauntered a few steps to a bit of\nspace left bare by the crowd and took a last glance at his sketch. His\nrule was to make sure at the final moment. The music was very good and\nthe group about the carriage was evidently enthusiastic. There was talk\nand praise and comment, and the old aristocrat nodded his head\nrepeatedly in applause.\n\n\"The Chancellor is music mad,\" a looker-on near the boys said to\nanother. \"At the opera every night unless serious affairs keep him away!\nThere you may see him nodding his old head and bursting his gloves with\napplauding when a good thing is done. He ought to have led an orchestra\nor played a 'cello. He is too big for first violin.\"\n\nThere was a group about the carriage to the last, when the music came to\nan end and it drove away. There had been no possible opportunity of\npassing close to it even had the presence of the young officer and the\nboy not presented an insurmountable obstacle.\n\nMarco and The Rat went on their way and passed by the Hof-Theater and\nread the bills. \"Tristan and Isolde\" was to be presented at night and a\ngreat singer would sing _Isolde_.\n\n\"He will go to hear that,\" both boys said at once. \"He will be sure to\ngo.\"\n\nIt was decided between them that Marco should go on his quest alone when\nnight came. One boy who hung around the entrance of the Opera would be\nobserved less than two.\n\n\"People notice crutches more than they notice legs,\" The Rat said. \"I'd\nbetter keep out of the way unless you need me. My time hasn't come yet.\nEven if it doesn't come at all I've--I've been on duty. I've gone with\nyou and I've been ready--that's what an aide-de-camp does.\"\n\nHe stayed at home and read such English papers as he could lay hands on\nand he drew plans and re-fought battles on paper.\n\nMarco went to the opera. Even if he had not known his way to the square\nnear the place where the Hof-Theater stood, he could easily have found\nit by following the groups of people in the streets who all seemed\nwalking in one direction. There were students in their odd caps walking\nthree or four abreast, there were young couples and older ones, and here\nand there whole families; there were soldiers of all ages, officers and\nprivates; and, when talk was to be heard in passing, it was always talk\nabout music.\n\nFor some time Marco waited in the square and watched the carriages roll\nup and pass under the huge pillared portico to deposit their contents at\nthe entrance and at once drive away in orderly sequence. He must make\nsure that the grand carriage with the green and silver liveries rolled\nup with the rest. If it came, he would buy a cheap ticket and go inside.\n\nIt was rather late when it arrived. People in Munich are not late for\nthe opera if it can be helped, and the coachman drove up hurriedly. The\ngreen and silver footman leaped to the ground and opened the carriage\ndoor almost before it stopped. The Chancellor got out looking less\ngenial than usual because he was afraid that he might lose some of the\noverture. A rosy-cheeked girl in a white frock was with him and she was\nevidently trying to soothe him.\n\n\"I do not think we are really late, Father,\" she said. \"Don't feel\ncross, dear. It will spoil the music for you.\"\n\nThis was not a time in which a man's attention could be attracted\nquietly. Marco ran to get the ticket which would give him a place among\nthe rows of young soldiers, artists, male and female students, and\nmusicians who were willing to stand four or five deep throughout the\nperformance of even the longest opera. He knew that, unless they were in\none of the few boxes which belonged only to the court, the Chancellor\nand his rosy-cheeked daughter would be in the best seats in the front\ncurve of the balcony which were the most desirable of the house. He soon\nsaw them. They had secured the central places directly below the large\nroyal box where two quiet princesses and their attendants were already\nseated.\n\nWhen he found he was not too late to hear the overture, the Chancellor's\nface become more genial than ever. He settled himself down to an evening\nof enjoyment and evidently forgot everything else in the world. Marco\ndid not lose sight of him. When the audience went out between acts to\npromenade in the corridors, he might go also and there might be a chance\nto pass near to him in the crowd. He watched him closely. Sometimes his\nfine old face saddened at the beautiful woe of the music, sometimes it\nlooked enraptured, and it was always evident that every note reached his\nsoul.\n\nThe pretty daughter who sat beside him was attentive but not so\nenthralled. After the first act two glittering young officers appeared\nand made elegant and low bows, drawing their heels together as they\nkissed her hand. They looked sorry when they were obliged to return to\ntheir seats again.\n\nAfter the second act the Chancellor sat for a few minutes as if he were\nin a dream. The people in the seats near him began to rise from their\nseats and file out into the corridors. The young officers were to be\nseen rising also. The rosy daughter leaned forward and touched her\nfather's arm gently.\n\n\"She wants him to take her out,\" Marco thought. \"He will take her\nbecause he is good-natured.\"\n\nHe saw him recall himself from his dream with a smile and then he rose\nand, after helping to arrange a silvery blue scarf round the girl's\nshoulders, gave her his arm just as Marco skipped out of his fourth-row\nstanding-place.\n\nIt was a rather warm night and the corridors were full. By the time\nMarco had reached the balcony floor, the pair had issued from the little\ndoor and were temporarily lost in the moving numbers.\n\nMarco quietly made his way among the crowd trying to look as if he\nbelonged to somebody. Once or twice his strong body and his dense black\neyes and lashes made people glance at him, but he was not the only boy\nwho had been brought to the opera so he felt safe enough to stop at the\nfoot of the stairs and watch those who went up and those who passed by.\nSuch a miscellaneous crowd as it was made up of--good unfashionable\nmusic-lovers mixed here and there with grand people of the court and the\ngay world.\n\nSuddenly he heard a low laugh and a moment later a hand lightly touched\nhim.\n\n\"You _did_ get out, then?\" a soft voice said.\n\nWhen he turned he felt his muscles stiffen. He ceased to slouch and did\nnot smile as he looked at the speaker. What he felt was a wave of fierce\nand haughty anger. It swept over him before he had time to control it.\n\nA lovely person who seemed swathed in several shades of soft violet\ndrapery was smiling at him with long, lovely eyes.\n\nIt was the woman who had trapped him into No. 10 Brandon Terrace.\n\n\n\n\nXXI\n\n\"HELP!\"\n\n\n\"Did it take you so long to find it?\" asked the Lovely Person with the\nsmile. \"Of course I knew you would find it in the end. But we had to\ngive ourselves time. How long did it take?\"\n\nMarco removed himself from beneath the touch of her hand. It was quietly\ndone, but there was a disdain in his young face which made her wince\nthough she pretended to shrug her shoulders amusedly.\n\n\"You refuse to answer?\" she laughed.\n\n\"I refuse.\"\n\nAt that very moment he saw at the curve of the corridor the Chancellor\nand his daughter approaching slowly. The two young officers were talking\ngaily to the girl. They were on their way back to their box. Was he\ngoing to lose them? Was he?\n\nThe delicate hand was laid on his shoulder again, but this time he felt\nthat it grasped him firmly.\n\n\"Naughty boy!\" the soft voice said. \"I am going to take you home with\nme. If you struggle I shall tell these people that you are my bad boy\nwho is here without permission. What will you answer? My escort is\ncoming down the staircase and will help me. Do you see?\" And in fact\nthere appeared in the crowd at the head of the staircase the figure of\nthe man he remembered.\n\nHe did see. A dampness broke out on the palms of his hands. If she did\nthis bold thing, what could he say to those she told her lie to? How\ncould he bring proof or explain who he was--and what story dare he tell?\nHis protestations and struggles would merely amuse the lookers-on, who\nwould see in them only the impotent rage of an insubordinate youngster.\n\nThere swept over him a wave of remembrance which brought back, as if he\nwere living through it again, the moment when he had stood in the\ndarkness of the wine cellar with his back against the door and heard the\nman walk away and leave him alone. He felt again as he had done\nthen--but now he was in another land and far away from his father. He\ncould do nothing to help himself unless Something showed him a way.\n\nHe made no sound, and the woman who held him saw only a flame leap under\nhis dense black lashes.\n\nBut something within him called out. It was as if he heard it. It was\nthat strong self--the self that was Marco, and it called--it called as\nif it shouted.\n\n\"Help!\" it called--to that Unknown Stranger Thing which had made worlds\nand which he and his father so often talked of and in whose power they\nso believed. \"Help!\"\n\nThe Chancellor was drawing nearer. Perhaps! Should he--?\n\n\"You are too proud to kick and shout,\" the voice went on. \"And people\nwould only laugh. Do you see?\"\n\nThe stairs were crowded and the man who was at the head of them could\nonly move slowly. But he had seen the boy.\n\nMarco turned so that he could face his captor squarely as if he were\ngoing to say something in answer to her. But he was not.\n\nEven as he made the movement of turning, the help he had called for came\nand he knew what he should do. And he could do two things at once--save\nhimself and give his Sign--because, the Sign once given, the Chancellor\nwould understand.\n\n\"He will be here in a moment. He has recognized you,\" the woman said.\n\nAs he glanced up the stairs, the delicate grip of her hand unconsciously\nslackened.\n\nMarco whirled away from her. The bell rang which was to warn the\naudience that they must return to their seats and he saw the Chancellor\nhasten his pace.\n\nA moment later, the old aristocrat found himself amazedly looking down\nat the pale face of a breathless lad who spoke to him in German and in\nsuch a manner that he could not but pause and listen.\n\n\"Sir,\" he was saying, \"the woman in violet at the foot of the stairs is\na spy. She trapped me once and she threatens to do it again. Sir, may I\nbeg you to protect me?\"\n\nHe said it low and fast. No one else could hear his words.\n\n\"What! What!\" the Chancellor exclaimed.\n\nAnd then, drawing a step nearer and quite as low and rapidly but with\nperfect distinctness, Marco uttered four words:\n\n\"The Lamp is lighted.\"\n\nThe Help cry had been answered instantly. Marco saw it at once in the\nold man's eyes, notwithstanding that he turned to look at the woman at\nthe foot of the staircase as if she only concerned him.\n\n\"What! What!\" he said again, and made a movement toward her, pulling his\nlarge moustache with a fierce hand.\n\nThen Marco recognized that a curious thing happened. The Lovely Person\nsaw the movement and the gray moustache, and that instant her smile died\naway and she turned quite white--so white, that under the brilliant\nelectric light she was almost green and scarcely looked lovely at all.\nShe made a sign to the man on the staircase and slipped through the\ncrowd like an eel. She was a slim flexible creature and never was a\ndisappearance more wonderful in its rapidity. Between stout matrons and\ntheir thin or stout escorts and families she made her way and lost\nherself--but always making toward the exit. In two minutes there was no\nsight of her violet draperies to be seen. She was gone and so,\nevidently, was her male companion.\n\nIt was plain to Marco that to follow the profession of a spy was not by\nany means a safe thing. The Chancellor had recognized her--she had\nrecognized the Chancellor who turned looking ferociously angry and spoke\nto one of the young officers.\n\n\"She and the man with her are two of the most dangerous spies in Europe.\nShe is a Rumanian and he is a Russian. What they wanted of this innocent\nlad I don't pretend to know. What did she threaten?\" to Marco.\n\nMarco was feeling rather cold and sick and had lost his healthy color\nfor the moment.\n\n\"She said she meant to take me home with her and would pretend I was her\nson who had come here without permission,\" he answered. \"She believes I\nknow something I do not.\" He made a hesitating but grateful bow. \"The\nthird act, sir--I must not keep you. Thank you! Thank you!\"\n\nThe Chancellor moved toward the entrance door of the balcony seats, but\nhe did it with his hand on Marco's shoulder.\n\n\"See that he gets home safely,\" he said to the younger of the two\nofficers. \"Send a messenger with him. He's young to be attacked by\ncreatures of that kind.\"\n\nPolite young officers naturally obey the commands of Chancellors and\nsuch dignitaries. This one found without trouble a young private who\nmarched with Marco through the deserted streets to his lodgings. He was\na stolid young Bavarian peasant and seemed to have no curiosity or even\nany interest in the reason for the command given him. He was in fact\nthinking of his sweetheart who lived near Konigsee and who had skated\nwith him on the frozen lake last winter. He scarcely gave a glance to\nthe schoolboy he was to escort, he neither knew nor wondered why.\n\nThe Rat had fallen asleep over his papers and lay with his head on his\nfolded arms on the table. But he was awakened by Marco's coming into the\nroom and sat up blinking his eyes in the effort to get them open.\n\n\"Did you see him? Did you get near enough?\" he drowsed.\n\n\"Yes,\" Marco answered. \"I got near enough.\"\n\nThe Rat sat upright suddenly.\n\n\"It's not been easy,\" he exclaimed. \"I'm sure something\nhappened--something went wrong.\"\n\n\"Something nearly went wrong--_very_ nearly,\" answered Marco. But as he\nspoke he took the sketch of the Chancellor out of the slit in his sleeve\nand tore it and burned it with a match. \"But I did get near enough. And\nthat's _two_.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThey talked long, before they went to sleep that night. The Rat grew\npale as he listened to the story of the woman in violet.\n\n\"I ought to have gone with you!\" he said. \"I see now. An aide-de-camp\nmust always be in attendance. It would have been harder for her to\nmanage two than one. I must always be near to watch, even if I am not\nclose by you. If you had not come back--if you had not come back!\" He\nstruck his clenched hands together fiercely. \"What should I have done!\"\n\nWhen Marco turned toward him from the table near which he was standing,\nhe looked like his father.\n\n\"You would have gone on with the Game just as far as you could,\" he\nsaid. \"You could not leave it. You remember the places, and the faces,\nand the Sign. There is some money; and when it was all gone, you could\nhave begged, as we used to pretend we should. We have not had to do it\nyet; and it was best to save it for country places and villages. But you\ncould have done it if you were obliged to. The Game would have to go\non.\"\n\nThe Rat caught at his thin chest as if he had been struck breathless.\n\n\"Without you?\" he gasped. \"Without you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Marco. \"And we must think of it, and plan in case anything\nlike that should happen.\"\n\nHe stopped himself quite suddenly, and sat down, looking straight before\nhim, as if at some far away thing he saw.\n\n\"Nothing will happen,\" he said. \"Nothing can.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" The Rat gulped, because his breath had not\nquite come back. \"Why will nothing happen?\"\n\n\"Because--\" the boy spoke in an almost matter-of-fact tone--in quite an\nunexalted tone at all events, \"you see I can always make a strong call,\nas I did tonight.\"\n\n\"Did you shout?\" The Rat asked. \"I didn't know you shouted.\"\n\n\"I didn't. I said nothing aloud. But I--the myself that is in me,\" Marco\ntouched himself on the breast, \"called out, 'Help! Help!' with all its\nstrength. And help came.\"\n\nThe Rat regarded him dubiously.\n\n\"What did it call to?\" he asked.\n\n\"To the Power--to the Strength-place--to the Thought that does things.\nThe Buddhist hermit, who told my father about it, called it 'The Thought\nthat thought the World.'\"\n\nA reluctant suspicion betrayed itself in The Rat's eyes.\n\n\"Do you mean you prayed?\" he inquired, with a slight touch of disfavor.\n\nMarco's eyes remained fixed upon him in vague thoughtfulness for a\nmoment or so of pause.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said at last. \"Perhaps it's the same thing--when you\nneed something so much that you cry out loud for it. But it's not words,\nit's a strong thing without a name. I called like that when I was shut\nin the wine-cellar. I remembered some of the things the old Buddhist\ntold my father.\"\n\nThe Rat moved restlessly.\n\n\"The help came that time,\" he admitted. \"How did it come to-night?\"\n\n\"In that thought which flashed into my mind almost the next second. It\ncame like lightning. All at once I knew if I ran to the Chancellor and\nsaid the woman was a spy, it would startle him into listening to me; and\nthat then I could give him the Sign; and that when I gave him the Sign,\nhe would know I was speaking the truth and would protect me.\"\n\n\"It was a splendid thought!\" The Rat said. \"And it was quick. But it was\nyou who thought of it.\"\n\n\"All thinking is part of the Big Thought,\" said Marco slowly. \"It\n_knows_--It _knows_. And the outside part of us somehow broke the chain\nthat linked us to It. And we are always trying to mend the chain,\nwithout knowing it. That is what our thinking is--trying to mend the\nchain. But we shall find out how to do it sometime. The old Buddhist\ntold my father so--just as the sun was rising from behind a high peak of\nthe Himalayas.\" Then he added hastily, \"I am only telling you what my\nfather told me, and he only told me what the old hermit told him.\"\n\n\"Does your father believe what he told him?\" The Rat's bewilderment had\nbecome an eager and restless thing.\n\n\"Yes, he believes it. He always thought something like it, himself. That\nis why he is so calm and knows so well how to wait.\"\n\n\"Is _that_ it!\" breathed The Rat. \"Is that why? Has--has he mended the\nchain?\" And there was awe in his voice, because of this one man to whom\nhe felt any achievement was possible.\n\n\"I believe he has,\" said Marco. \"Don't you think so yourself?\"\n\n\"He has done something,\" The Rat said.\n\nHe seemed to be thinking things over before he spoke again--and then\neven more slowly than Marco.\n\n\"If he could mend the chain,\" he said almost in a whisper, \"he could\nfind out where the descendant of the Lost Prince is. He would know what\nto do for Samavia!\"\n\nHe ended the words with a start, and his whole face glowed with a new,\namazed light.\n\n\"Perhaps he does know!\" he cried. \"If the help comes like thoughts--as\nyours did--perhaps his thought of letting us give the Sign was part of\nit. We--just we two every-day boys--are part of it!\"\n\n\"The old Buddhist said--\" began Marco.\n\n\"Look here!\" broke in The Rat. \"Tell me the whole story. I want to hear\nit.\"\n\nIt was because Loristan had heard it, and listened and believed, that\nThe Rat had taken fire. His imagination seized upon the idea, as it\nwould have seized on some theory of necromancy proved true and workable.\n\nWith his elbows on the table and his hands in his hair, he leaned\nforward, twisting a lock with restless fingers. His breath quickened.\n\n\"Tell it,\" he said, \"I want to hear it all!\"\n\n\"I shall have to tell it in my own words,\" Marco said. \"And it won't be\nas wonderful as it was when my father told it to me. This is what I\nremember:\n\n\"My father had gone through much pain and trouble. A great load was upon\nhim, and he had been told he was going to die before his work was done.\nHe had gone to India, because a man he was obliged to speak to had gone\nthere to hunt, and no one knew when he would return. My father followed\nhim for months from one wild place to another, and, when he found him,\nthe man would not hear or believe what he had come so far to say. Then\nhe had jungle-fever and almost died. Once the natives left him for dead\nin a bungalow in the forest, and he heard the jackals howling round him\nall the night. Through all the hours he was only alive enough to be\nconscious of two things--all the rest of him seemed gone from his body:\nhis thought knew that his work was unfinished--and his body heard the\njackals howl!\"\n\n\"Was the work for Samavia?\" The Rat put in quickly. \"If he had died that\nnight, the descendant of the Lost Prince never would have been\nfound--never!\" The Rat bit his lip so hard that a drop of blood started\nfrom it.\n\n\"When he was slowly coming alive again, a native, who had gone back and\nstayed to wait upon him, told him that near the summit of a mountain,\nabout fifty miles away, there was a ledge which jutted out into space\nand hung over the valley, which was thousands of feet below. On the\nledge there was a hut in which there lived an ancient Buddhist, who was\na holy man, as they called him, and who had been there during time which\nhad not been measured. They said that their grandparents and\ngreat-grandparents had known of him, though very few persons had ever\nseen him. It was told that the most savage beast was tame before him.\nThey said that a man-eating tiger would stop to salute him, and that a\nthirsty lioness would bring her whelps to drink at the spring near his\nhut.\"\n\n\"That was a lie,\" said The Rat promptly.\n\nMarco neither laughed nor frowned.\n\n\"How do we _know_?\" he said. \"It was a native's story, and it might be\nanything. My father neither said it was true nor false. He listened to\nall that was told him by natives. They said that the holy man was the\nbrother of the stars. He knew all things past and to come, and could\nheal the sick. But most people, especially those who had sinful\nthoughts, were afraid to go near him.\"\n\n\"I'd like to have seen--\" The Rat pondered aloud, but he did not finish.\n\n\"Before my father was well, he had made up his mind to travel to the\nledge if he could. He felt as if he must go. He thought that if he were\ngoing to die, the hermit might tell him some wise thing to do for\nSamavia.\"\n\n\"He might have given him a message to leave to the Secret Ones,\" said\nThe Rat.\n\n\"He was so weak when he set out on his journey that he wondered if he\nwould reach the end of it. Part of the way he traveled by bullock cart,\nand part, he was carried by natives. But at last the bearers came to a\nplace more than halfway up the mountain, and would go no further. Then\nthey went back and left him to climb the rest of the way himself. They\nhad traveled slowly and he had got more strength, but he was weak yet.\nThe forest was more wonderful than anything he had ever seen. There were\ntropical trees with foliage like lace, and some with huge leaves, and\nsome of them seemed to reach the sky. Sometimes he could barely see\ngleams of blue through them. And vines swung down from their high\nbranches, and caught each other, and matted together; and there were hot\nscents, and strange flowers, and dazzling birds darting about, and thick\nmoss, and little cascades bursting out. The path grew narrower and\nsteeper, and the flower scents and the sultriness made it like walking\nin a hothouse. He heard rustlings in the undergrowth, which might have\nbeen made by any kind of wild animal; once he stepped across a deadly\nsnake without seeing it. But it was asleep and did not hurt him. He knew\nthe natives had been convinced that he would not reach the ledge; but\nfor some strange reason he believed he should. He stopped and rested\nmany times, and he drank some milk he had brought in a canteen. The\nhigher he climbed, the more wonderful everything was, and a strange\nfeeling began to fill him. He said his body stopped being tired and\nbegan to feel very light. And his load lifted itself from his heart, as\nif it were not his load any more but belonged to something stronger.\nEven Samavia seemed to be safe. As he went higher and higher, and looked\ndown the abyss at the world below, it appeared as if it were not real\nbut only a dream he had wakened from--only a dream.\"\n\nThe Rat moved restlessly.\n\n\"Perhaps he was light-headed with the fever,\" he suggested.\n\n\"The fever had left him, and the weakness had left him,\" Marco answered.\n\"It seemed as if he had never really been ill at all--as if no one\ncould be ill, because things like that were only dreams, just as the\nworld was.\"\n\n\"I wish I'd been with him! Perhaps I could have thrown these away--down\ninto the abyss!\" And The Rat shook his crutches which rested against the\ntable. \"I feel as if I was climbing, too. Go on.\"\n\nMarco had become more absorbed than The Rat. He had lost himself in the\nmemory of the story.\n\n\"I felt that _I_ was climbing, when he told me,\" he said. \"I felt as if\nI were breathing in the hot flower-scents and pushing aside the big\nleaves and giant ferns. There had been a rain, and they were wet and\nshining with big drops, like jewels, that showered over him as he thrust\nhis way through and under them. And the stillness and the height--the\nstillness and the height! I can't make it real to you as he made it to\nme! I can't! I was there. He took me. And it was so high--and so\nstill--and so beautiful that I could scarcely bear it.\"\n\nBut the truth was, that with some vivid boy-touch he had carried his\nhearer far. The Rat was deadly quiet. Even his eyes had not moved. He\nspoke almost as if he were in a sort of trance. \"It's real,\" he said.\n\"I'm there now. As high as you--go on--go on. I want to climb higher.\"\n\nAnd Marco, understanding, went on.\n\n\"The day was over and the stars were out when he reached the place were\nthe ledge was. He said he thought that during the last part of the climb\nhe never looked on the earth at all. The stars were so immense that he\ncould not look away from them. They seemed to be drawing him up. And all\noverhead was like violet velvet, and they hung there like great lamps of\nradiance. Can you see them? You must see them. My father saw them all\nnight long. They were part of the wonder.\"\n\n\"I see them,\" The Rat answered, still in his trance-like voice and\nwithout stirring, and Marco knew he did.\n\n\"And there, with the huge stars watching it, was the hut on the ledge.\nAnd there was no one there. The door was open. And outside it was a low\nbench and table of stone. And on the table was a meal of dates and rice,\nwaiting. Not far from the hut was a deep spring, which ran away in a\nclear brook. My father drank and bathed his face there. Then he went out\non the ledge, and sat down and waited, with his face turned up to the\nstars. He did not lie down, and he thought he saw the stars all the time\nhe waited. He was sure he did not sleep. He did not know how long he sat\nthere alone. But at last he drew his eyes from the stars, as if he had\nbeen commanded to do it. And he was not alone any more. A yard or so\naway from him sat the holy man. He knew it was the hermit because his\neyes were different from any human eyes he had ever beheld. They were as\nstill as the night was, and as deep as the shadows covering the world\nthousands of feet below, and they had a far, far look, and a strange\nlight was in them.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked The Rat hoarsely.\n\n\"He only said, 'Rise, my son. I awaited thee. Go and eat the food I\nprepared for thee, and then we will speak together.' He didn't move or\nspeak again until my father had eaten the meal. He only sat on the moss\nand let his eyes rest on the shadows over the abyss. When my father went\nback, he made a gesture which meant that he should sit near him.\n\n\"Then he sat still for several minutes, and let his eyes rest on my\nfather, until he felt as if the light in them were set in the midst of\nhis own body and his soul. Then he said, 'I cannot tell thee all thou\nwouldst know. That I may not do.' He had a wonderful gentle voice, like\na deep soft bell. 'But the work will be done. Thy life and thy son's\nlife will set it on its way.'\n\n\"They sat through the whole night together. And the stars hung quite\nnear, as if they listened. And there were sounds in the bushes of\nstealthy, padding feet which wandered about as if the owners of them\nlistened too. And the wonderful, low, peaceful voice of the holy man\nwent on and on, telling of wonders which seemed like miracles but which\nwere to him only the 'working of the Law.'\"\n\n\"What is the Law?\" The Rat broke in.\n\n\"There were two my father wrote down, and I learned them. The first was\nthe law of The One. I'll try to say that,\" and he covered his eyes and\nwaited through a moment of silence.\n\nIt seemed to The Rat as if the room held an extraordinary stillness.\n\n\"Listen!\" came next. \"This is it:\n\n\"'_There are a myriad worlds. There is but One Thought out of which they\ngrew. Its Law is Order which cannot swerve. Its creatures are free to\nchoose. Only they can create Disorder, which in itself is Pain and Woe\nand Hate and Fear. These they alone can bring forth. The Great One is a\nGolden Light. It is not remote but near. Hold thyself within its glow\nand thou wilt behold all things clearly. First, with all thy breathing\nbeing, know one thing! That thine own thought--when so thou standest--is\none with That which thought the Worlds!_'\"\n\n\"What?\" gasped The Rat. \"_My_ thought--the things _I_ think!\"\n\n\"Your thoughts--boys' thoughts--anybody's thoughts.\"\n\n\"You're giving me the jim-jams!\"\n\n\"He said it,\" answered Marco. \"And it was then he spoke about the broken\nLink--and about the greatest books in the world--that in all their\ndifferent ways, they were only saying over and over again one thing\nthousands of times. Just this thing--'Hate not, Fear not, Love.' And he\nsaid that was Order. And when it was disturbed, suffering came--poverty\nand misery and catastrophe and wars.\"\n\n\"Wars!\" The Rat said sharply. \"The World couldn't do without war--and\narmies and defences! What about Samavia?\"\n\n\"My father asked him that. And this is what he answered. I learned that\ntoo. Let me think again,\" and he waited as he had waited before. Then he\nlifted his head. \"Listen! This is it:\n\n\"_'Out of the blackness of Disorder and its outpouring of human misery,\nthere will arise the Order which is Peace. When Man learns that he is\none with the Thought which itself creates all beauty, all power, all\nsplendor, and all repose, he will not fear that his brother can rob him\nof his heart's desire. He will stand in the Light and draw to himself\nhis own.'_\"\n\n\"Draw to himself?\" The Rat said. \"Draw what he wants? I don't believe\nit!\"\n\n\"Nobody does,\" said Marco. \"We don't know. He said we stood in the dark\nof the night--without stars--and did not know that the broken chain\nswung just above us.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" said The Rat. \"It's too big!\"\n\nMarco did not say whether he believed it or not. He only went on\nspeaking.\n\n\"My father listened until he felt as if he had stopped breathing. Just\nat the stillest of the stillness the Buddhist stopped speaking. And\nthere was a rustling of the undergrowth a few yards away, as if\nsomething big was pushing its way through--and there was the soft pad of\nfeet. The Buddhist turned his head and my father heard him say softly:\n'Come forth, Sister.'\n\n\"And a huge leopardess with two cubs walked out on to the ledge and came\nto him and threw herself down with a heavy lunge near his feet.\"\n\n\"Your father saw that!\" cried out The Rat. \"You mean the old fellow knew\nsomething that made wild beasts afraid to touch him or any one near\nhim?\"\n\n\"Not afraid. They knew he was their brother, and that he was one with\nthe Law. He had lived so long with the Great Thought that all darkness\nand fear had left him forever. He had mended the Chain.\"\n\nThe Rat had reached deep waters. He leaned forward--his hands burrowing\nin his hair, his face scowling and twisted, his eyes boring into space.\nHe had climbed to the ledge at the mountain-top; he had seen the\nluminous immensity of the stars, and he had looked down into the shadows\nfilling the world thousands of feet below. Was there some remote deep in\nhim from whose darkness a slow light was rising? All that Loristan had\nsaid he knew must be true. But the rest of it--?\n\nMarco got up and came over to him. He looked like his father again.\n\n\"If the descendant of the Lost Prince is brought back to rule Samavia,\nhe will teach his people the Law of the One. It was for that the holy\nman taught my father until the dawn came.\"\n\n\"Who will--who will teach the Lost Prince--the new King--when he is\nfound?\" The Rat cried. \"Who will teach him?\"\n\n\"The hermit said my father would. He said he would also teach his\nson--and that son would teach his son--and he would teach his. And\nthrough such as they were, the whole world would come to know the Order\nand the Law.\"\n\nNever had The Rat looked so strange and fierce a thing. A whole world at\npeace! No tactics--no battles--no slaughtered heroes--no clash of arms,\nand fame! It made him feel sick. And yet--something set his chest\nheaving.\n\n\"And your father would teach him that--when he was found! So that he\ncould teach his sons. Your father _believes_ in it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Marco answered. He said nothing but \"Yes.\" The Rat threw himself\nforward on the table, face downward.\n\n\"Then,\" he said, \"he must make me believe it. He must teach me--if he\ncan.\"\n\nThey heard a clumping step upon the staircase, and, when it reached the\nlanding, it stopped at their door. Then there was a solid knock.\n\nWhen Marco opened the door, the young soldier who had escorted him from\nthe Hof-Theater was standing outside. He looked as uninterested and\nstolid as before, as he handed in a small flat package.\n\n\"You must have dropped it near your seat at the Opera,\" he said. \"I was\nto give it into your own hands. It is your purse.\"\n\nAfter he had clumped down the staircase again, Marco and The Rat drew a\nquick breath at one and the same time.\n\n\"I had no seat and I had no purse,\" Marco said. \"Let us open it.\"\n\nThere was a flat limp leather note-holder inside. In it was a paper, at\nthe head of which were photographs of the Lovely Person and her\ncompanion. Beneath were a few lines which stated that they were the well\nknown spies, Eugenia Karovna and Paul Varel, and that the bearer must be\nprotected against them. It was signed by the Chief of the Police. On a\nseparate sheet was written the command: \"Carry this with you as\nprotection.\"\n\n\"That is help,\" The Rat said. \"It would protect us, even in another\ncountry. The Chancellor sent it--but you made the strong call--and it's\nhere!\"\n\nThere was no street lamp to shine into their windows when they went at\nlast to bed. When the blind was drawn up, they were nearer the sky than\nthey had been in the Marylebone Road. The last thing each of them saw,\nas he went to sleep, was the stars--and in their dreams, they saw them\ngrow larger and larger, and hang like lamps of radiance against the\nviolet-velvet sky above a ledge of a Himalayan Mountain, where they\nlistened to the sound of a low voice going on and on and on.\n\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nTHE NIGHT VIGIL\n\n\nOn a hill in the midst of a great Austrian plain, around which high Alps\nwait watching through the ages, stands a venerable fortress, almost more\nbeautiful than anything one has ever seen. Perhaps, if it were not for\nthe great plain flowering broadly about it with its wide-spread beauties\nof meadow-land, and wood, and dim toned buildings gathered about farms,\nand its dream of a small ancient city at its feet, it might--though it\nis to be doubted--seem something less a marvel of medieval\npicturesqueness. But out of the plain rises the low hill, and\nsurrounding it at a stately distance stands guard the giant majesty of\nAlps, with shoulders in the clouds and god-like heads above them,\nlooking on--always looking on--sometimes themselves ethereal clouds of\nsnow-whiteness, some times monster bare crags which pierce the blue, and\nwhose unchanging silence seems to know the secret of the everlasting.\nAnd on the hill which this august circle holds in its embrace, as though\nit enclosed a treasure, stands the old, old, towered fortress built as a\ncitadel for the Prince Archbishops, who were kings in their domain in\nthe long past centuries when the splendor and power of ecclesiastical\nprinces was among the greatest upon earth.\n\nAnd as you approach the town--and as you leave it--and as you walk\nthrough its streets, the broad calm empty-looking ones, or the narrow\nthoroughfares whose houses seem so near to each other, whether you climb\nor descend--or cross bridges, or gaze at churches, or step out on your\nbalcony at night to look at the mountains and the moon--always it seems\nthat from some point you can see it gazing down at you--the citadel of\nHohen-Salzburg.\n\nIt was to Salzburg they went next, because at Salzburg was to be found\nthe man who looked like a hair-dresser and who worked in a barber's\nshop. Strange as it might seem, to him also must be carried the Sign.\n\n\"There may be people who come to him to be shaved--soldiers, or men who\nknow things,\" The Rat worked it out, \"and he can speak to them when he\nis standing close to them. It will be easy to get near him. You can go\nand have your hair cut.\"\n\nThe journey from Munich was not a long one, and during the latter part\nof it they had the wooden-seated third-class carriage to themselves.\nEven the drowsy old peasant who nodded and slept in one corner got out\nwith his bundles at last. To Marco the mountains were long-known wonders\nwhich could never grow old. They had always and always been so old!\nSurely they had been the first of the world! Surely they had been\nstanding there waiting when it was said \"Let there be Light.\" The Light\nhad known it would find them there. They were so silent, and yet it\nseemed as if they said some amazing thing--something which would take\nyour breath from you if you could hear it. And they never changed. The\nclouds changed, they wreathed them, and hid them, and trailed down them,\nand poured out storm torrents on them, and thundered against them, and\ndarted forked lightnings round them. But the mountains stood there\nafterwards as if such things had not been and were not in the world.\nWinds roared and tore at them, centuries passed over them--centuries of\nmillions of lives, of changing of kingdoms and empires, of battles and\nworld-wide fame which grew and died and passed away; and temples\ncrumbled, and kings' tombs were forgotten, and cities were buried and\nothers built over them after hundreds of years--and perhaps a few stones\nfell from a mountain side, or a fissure was worn, which the people below\ncould not even see. And that was all. There they stood, and perhaps\ntheir secret was that they had been there for ever and ever. That was\nwhat the mountains said to Marco, which was why he did not want to talk\nmuch, but sat and gazed out of the carriage window.\n\nThe Rat had been very silent all the morning. He had been silent when\nthey got up, and he had scarcely spoken when they made their way to the\nstation at Munich and sat waiting for their train. It seemed to Marco\nthat he was thinking so hard that he was like a person who was far away\nfrom the place he stood in. His brows were drawn together and his eyes\ndid not seem to see the people who passed by. Usually he saw everything\nand made shrewd remarks on almost all he saw. But to-day he was somehow\notherwise absorbed. He sat in the train with his forehead against the\nwindow and stared out. He moved and gasped when he found himself staring\nat the Alps, but afterwards he was even strangely still. It was not\nuntil after the sleepy old peasant had gathered his bundles and got out\nat a station that he spoke, and he did it without turning his head.\n\n\"You only told me one of the two laws,\" he said. \"What was the other\none?\"\n\nMarco brought himself back from his dream of reaching the highest\nmountain-top and seeing clouds float beneath his feet in the sun. He had\nto come back a long way.\n\n\"Are you thinking of that? I wondered what you had been thinking of all\nthe morning,\" he said.\n\n\"I couldn't stop thinking of it. What was the second one?\" said The Rat,\nbut he did not turn his head.\n\n\"It was called the Law of Earthly Living. It was for every day,\" said\nMarco. \"It was for the ordering of common things--the small things we\nthink don't matter, as well as the big ones. I always remember that one\nwithout any trouble. This was it:\n\n\"_'Let pass through thy mind, my son, only the image thou wouldst desire\nto see become a truth. Meditate only upon the wish of thy heart--seeing\nfirst that it is such as can wrong no man and is not ignoble. Then will\nit take earthly form and draw near to thee._\n\n\"_'This is the Law of That which Creates.'_\"\n\nThen The Rat turned round. He had a shrewdly reasoning mind.\n\n\"That sounds as if you could get anything you wanted, if you think about\nit long enough and in the right way,\" he said. \"But perhaps it only\nmeans that, if you do it, you'll be happy after you're dead. My father\nused to shout with laughing when he was drunk and talked about things\nlike that and looked at his rags.\"\n\nHe hugged his knees for a few minutes. He was remembering the rags, and\nthe fog-darkened room in the slums, and the loud, hideous laughter.\n\n\"What if you want something that will harm somebody else?\" he said next.\n\"What if you hate some one and wish you could kill him?\"\n\n\"That was one of the questions my father asked that night on the ledge.\nThe holy man said people always asked it,\" Marco answered. \"This was the\nanswer:\n\n\"_'Let him who stretcheth forth his hand to draw the lightning to his\nbrother recall that through his own soul and body will pass the bolt.'_\"\n\n\"Wonder if there's anything in it?\" The Rat pondered. \"It'd make a chap\ncareful if he believed it! Revenging yourself on a man would be like\nholding him against a live wire to kill him and getting all the volts\nthrough yourself.\"\n\nA sudden anxiety revealed itself in his face.\n\n\"Does your father believe it?\" he asked. \"Does he?\"\n\n\"He knows it is true,\" Marco said.\n\n\"I'll own up,\" The Rat decided after further reflection--\"I'll own up\nI'm glad that there isn't any one left that I've a grudge against. There\nisn't any one--now.\"\n\nThen he fell again into silence and did not speak until their journey\nwas at an end. As they arrived early in the day, they had plenty of time\nto wander about the marvelous little old city. But through the wide\nstreets and through the narrow ones, under the archways into the market\ngardens, across the bridge and into the square where the \"glockenspiel\"\nplayed its old tinkling tune, everywhere the Citadel looked down and\nalways The Rat walked on in his dream.\n\nThey found the hair-dresser's shop in one of the narrow streets. There\nwere no grand shops there, and this particular shop was a modest one.\nThey walked past it once, and then went back. It was a shop so humble\nthat there was nothing remarkable in two common boys going into it to\nhave their hair cut. An old man came forward to receive them. He was\nevidently glad of their modest patronage. He undertook to attend to The\nRat himself, but, having arranged him in a chair, he turned about and\ncalled to some one in the back room.\n\n\"Heinrich,\" he said.\n\nIn the slit in Marco's sleeve was the sketch of the man with smooth\ncurled hair, who looked like a hair-dresser. They had found a corner in\nwhich to take their final look at it before they turned back to come in.\nHeinrich, who came forth from the small back room, had smooth curled\nhair. He looked extremely like a hair-dresser. He had features like\nthose in the sketch--his nose and mouth and chin and figure were like\nwhat Marco had drawn and committed to memory. But--\n\nHe gave Marco a chair and tied the professional white covering around\nhis neck. Marco leaned back and closed his eyes a moment.\n\n\"That is _not_ the man!\" he was saying to himself. \"He is _not_ the man.\"\n\nHow he knew he was not, he could not have explained, but he felt sure.\nIt was a strong conviction. But for the sudden feeling, nothing would\nhave been easier than to give the Sign. And if he could not give it now,\nwhere was the one to whom it must be spoken, and what would be the\nresult if that one could not be found? And if there were two who were so\nmuch alike, how could he be sure?\n\nEach owner of each of the pictured faces was a link in a powerful secret\nchain; and if a link were missed, the chain would be broken. Each time\nHeinrich came within the line of his vision, he recorded every feature\nafresh and compared it with the remembered sketch. Each time the\nresemblance became more close, but each time some persistent inner\nconviction repeated, \"No; the Sign is not for him!\"\n\nIt was disturbing, also, to find that The Rat was all at once as\nrestless as he had previously been silent and preoccupied. He moved in\nhis chair, to the great discomfort of the old hair-dresser. He kept\nturning his head to talk. He asked Marco to translate divers questions\nhe wished him to ask the two men. They were questions about the\nCitadel--about the Monchsberg--the Residenz--the Glockenspiel--the\nmountains. He added one query to another and could not sit still.\n\n\"The young gentleman will get an ear snipped,\" said the old man to\nMarco. \"And it will not be my fault.\"\n\n\"What shall I do?\" Marco was thinking. \"He is not the man.\"\n\nHe did not give the Sign. He must go away and think it out, though where\nhis thoughts would lead him he did not know. This was a more difficult\nproblem than he had ever dreamed of facing. There was no one to ask\nadvice of. Only himself and The Rat, who was nervously wriggling and\ntwisting in his chair.\n\n\"You must sit still,\" he said to him. \"The hair-dresser is afraid you\nwill make him cut you by accident.\"\n\n\"But I want to know who lives at the Residenz?\" said The Rat. \"These men\ncan tell us things if you ask them.\"\n\n\"It is done now,\" said the old hair-dresser with a relieved air.\n\"Perhaps the cutting of his hair makes the young gentleman nervous. It\nis sometimes so.\"\n\nThe Rat stood close to Marco's chair and asked questions until Heinrich\nalso had done his work. Marco could not understand his companion's\nchange of mood. He realized that, if he had wished to give the Sign, he\nhad been allowed no opportunity. He could not have given it. The\nrestless questioning had so directed the older man's attention to his\nson and Marco that nothing could have been said to Heinrich without his\nobserving it.\n\n\"I could not have spoken if he had been the man,\" Marco said to himself.\n\nTheir very exit from the shop seemed a little hurried. When they were\nfairly in the street, The Rat made a clutch at Marco's arm.\n\n\"You didn't give it?\" he whispered breathlessly. \"I kept talking and\ntalking to prevent you.\"\n\nMarco tried not to feel breathless, and he tried to speak in a low and\nlevel voice with no hint of exclamation in it.\n\n\"Why did you say that?\" he asked.\n\nThe Rat drew closer to him.\n\n\"That was not the man!\" he whispered. \"It doesn't matter how much he\nlooks like him, he isn't the right one.\"\n\nHe was pale and swinging along swiftly as if he were in a hurry.\n\n\"Let's get into a quiet place,\" he said. \"Those queer things you've been\ntelling me have got hold of me. How did I know? How could I know--unless\nit's because I've been trying to work that second law? I've been saying\nto myself that we should be told the right things to do--for the Game\nand for your father--and so that I could be the right sort of\naide-de-camp. I've been working at it, and, when he came out, I knew he\nwas not the man in spite of his looks. And I couldn't be sure you knew,\nand I thought, if I kept on talking and interrupting you with silly\nquestions, you could be prevented from speaking.\"\n\n\"There's a place not far away where we can get a look at the mountains.\nLet's go there and sit down,\" said Marco. \"I knew it was not the right\none, too. It's the Help over again.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's the Help--it's the Help--it must be,\" muttered The Rat,\nwalking fast and with a pale, set face. \"It could not be anything else.\"\n\nThey got away from the streets and the people and reached the quiet\nplace where they could see the mountains. There they sat down by the\nwayside. The Rat took off his cap and wiped his forehead, but it was not\nonly the quick walking which had made it damp.\n\n\"The queerness of it gave me a kind of fright,\" he said. \"When he came\nout and he was near enough for me to see him, a sudden strong feeling\ncame over me. It seemed as if I knew he wasn't the man. Then I said to\nmyself--'but he looks like him'--and I began to get nervous. And then I\nwas sure again--and then I wanted to try to stop you from giving him the\nSign. And then it all seemed foolishness--and the next second all the\nthings you had told me rushed back to me at once--and I remembered what\nI had been thinking ever since--and I said--'Perhaps it's the Law\nbeginning to work,' and the palms of my hands got moist.\"\n\nMarco was very quiet. He was looking at the farthest and highest peaks\nand wondering about many things.\n\n\"It was the expression of his face that was different,\" he said. \"And\nhis eyes. They are rather smaller than the right man's are. The light in\nthe shop was poor, and it was not until the last time he bent over me\nthat I found out what I had not seen before. His eyes are gray--the\nother ones are brown.\"\n\n\"Did you see that!\" The Rat exclaimed. \"Then we're sure! We're safe!\"\n\n\"We're not safe till we've found the right man,\" Marco said. \"Where is\nhe? Where is he? Where is he?\"\n\nHe said the words dreamily and quietly, as if he were lost in\nthought--but also rather as if he expected an answer. And he still\nlooked at the far-off peaks. The Rat, after watching him a moment or so,\nbegan to look at them also. They were like a loadstone to him too. There\nwas something stilling about them, and when your eyes had rested upon\nthem a few moments they did not want to move away.\n\n\"There must be a ledge up there somewhere,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Let's go up and look for it and sit there and think and think--about\nfinding the right man.\"\n\nThere seemed nothing fantastic in this to Marco. To go into some quiet\nplace and sit and think about the thing he wanted to remember or to find\nout was an old way of his. To be quiet was always the best thing, his\nfather had taught him. It was like listening to something which could\nspeak without words.\n\n\"There is a little train which goes up the Gaisberg,\" he said. \"When you\nare at the top, a world of mountains spreads around you. Lazarus went\nonce and told me. And we can lie out on the grass all night. Let us go,\nAide-de-camp.\"\n\nSo they went, each one thinking the same thought, and each boy-mind\nholding its own vision. Marco was the calmer of the two, because his\nbelief that there was always help to be found was an accustomed one and\nhad ceased to seem to partake of the supernatural. He believed quite\nsimply that it was the working of a law, not the breaking of one, which\ngave answer and led him in his quests. The Rat, who had known nothing of\nlaws other than those administered by police-courts, was at once awed\nand fascinated by the suggestion of crossing some borderland of the\nUnknown. The law of the One had baffled and overthrown him, with its\nsweeping away of the enmities of passions which created wars and called\nfor armies. But the Law of Earthly Living seemed to offer practical\nbenefits if you could hold on to yourself enough to work it.\n\n\"You wouldn't get everything for nothing, as far as I can make out,\" he\nhad said to Marco. \"You'd have to sweep all the rubbish out of your\nmind--sweep it as if you did it with a broom--and then keep on thinking\nstraight and believing you were going to get things--and working for\nthem--and they'd come.\"\n\nThen he had laughed a short ugly laugh because he recalled something.\n\n\"There was something in the Bible that my father used to jeer\nabout--something about a man getting what he prayed for if he believed\nit,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, yes, it's there,\" said Marco. \"That if a man pray believing he\nshall receive what he asks it shall be given him. All the books say\nsomething like it. It's been said so often it makes you believe it.\"\n\n\"He didn't believe it, and I didn't,\" said The Rat.\n\n\"Nobody does--really,\" answered Marco, as he had done once before. \"It's\nbecause we don't know.\"\n\nThey went up the Gaisberg in the little train, which pushed and dragged\nand panted slowly upward with them. It took them with it stubbornly and\ngradually higher and higher until it had left Salzburg and the Citadel\nbelow and had reached the world of mountains which rose and spread and\nlifted great heads behind each other and beside each other and beyond\neach other until there seemed no other land on earth but that on\nmountain sides and backs and shoulders and crowns. And also one felt the\nabsurdity of living upon flat ground, where life must be an\ninsignificant thing.\n\nThere were only a few sight-seers in the small carriages, and they were\ngoing to look at the view from the summit. They were not in search of a\nledge.\n\nThe Rat and Marco were. When the little train stopped at the top, they\ngot out with the rest. They wandered about with them over the short\ngrass on the treeless summit and looked out from this viewpoint and the\nother. The Rat grew more and more silent, and his silence was not merely\na matter of speechlessness but of expression. He _looked_ silent and as if\nhe were no longer aware of the earth. They left the sight-seers at last\nand wandered away by themselves. They found a ledge where they could sit\nor lie and where even the world of mountains seemed below them. They had\nbrought some simple food with them, and they laid it behind a jutting\nbit of rock. When the sight-seers boarded the laboring little train\nagain and were dragged back down the mountain, their night of vigil\nwould begin.\n\nThat was what it was to be. A night of stillness on the heights, where\nthey could wait and watch and hold themselves ready to hear any thought\nwhich spoke to them.\n\nThe Rat was so thrilled that he would not have been surprised if he had\nheard a voice from the place of the stars. But Marco only believed that\nin this great stillness and beauty, if he held his boy-soul quiet\nenough, he should find himself at last thinking of something that would\nlead him to the place which held what it was best that he should find.\nThe people returned to the train and it set out upon its way down the\nsteepness.\n\nThey heard it laboring on its way, as though it was forced to make as\nmuch effort to hold itself back as it had made to drag itself upward.\n\nThen they were alone, and it was a loneness such as an eagle might feel\nwhen it held itself poised high in the curve of blue. And they sat and\nwatched. They saw the sun go down and, shade by shade, deepen and make\nradiant and then draw away with it the last touches of color--rose-gold,\nrose-purple, and rose-gray.\n\nOne mountain-top after another held its blush a few moments and lost it.\nIt took long to gather them all but at length they were gone and the\nmarvel of night fell.\n\nThe breath of the forests below was sweet about them, and soundlessness\nenclosed them which was of unearthly peace. The stars began to show\nthemselves, and presently the two who waited found their faces turned\nupward to the sky and they both were speaking in whispers.\n\n\"The stars look large here,\" The Rat said.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Marco. \"We are not as high as the Buddhist was, but it\nseems like the top of the world.\"\n\n\"There is a light on the side of the mountain yonder which is not a\nstar,\" The Rat whispered.\n\n\"It is a light in a hut where the guides take the climbers to rest and\nto spend the night,\" answered Marco.\n\n\"It is so still,\" The Rat whispered again after a silence, and Marco\nwhispered back:\n\n\"It is so still.\"\n\nThey had eaten their meal of black bread and cheese after the setting of\nthe sun, and now they lay down on their backs and looked up until the\nfirst few stars had multiplied themselves into myriads. They began a\nlittle low talk, but the soundlessness was stronger than themselves.\n\n\"How am I going to hold on to that second law?\" The Rat said restlessly.\n\"'Let pass through thy mind only the image thou wouldst see become a\ntruth.' The things that are passing through my mind are not the things I\nwant to come true. What if we don't find him--don't find the right one,\nI mean!\"\n\n\"Lie still--still--and look up at the stars,\" whispered Marco. \"They\ngive you a _sure_ feeling.\"\n\nThere was something in the curious serenity of him which calmed even his\naide-de-camp. The Rat lay still and looked--and looked--and thought. And\nwhat he thought of was the desire of his heart. The soundlessness\nenwrapped him and there was no world left. That there was a spark of\nlight in the mountain-climbers' rest-hut was a thing forgotten.\n\nThey were only two boys, and they had begun their journey on the\nearliest train and had been walking about all day and thinking of great\nand anxious things.\n\n\"It is so still,\" The Rat whispered again at last.\n\n\"It is so still,\" whispered Marco.\n\nAnd the mountains rising behind each other and beside each other and\nbeyond each other in the night, and also the myriads of stars which had\nso multiplied themselves, looking down knew that they were asleep--as\nsleep the human things which do not watch forever.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Some one is smoking,\" Marco found himself saying in a dream. After\nwhich he awakened and found that the smoke was not part of a dream at\nall. It came from the pipe of a young man who had an alpenstock and who\nlooked as if he had climbed to see the sun rise. He wore the clothes of\na climber and a green hat with a tuft at the back. He looked down at the\ntwo boys, surprised.\n\n\"Good day,\" he said. \"Did you sleep here so that you could see the sun\nget up?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Marco.\n\n\"Were you cold?\"\n\n\"We slept too soundly to know. And we brought our thick coats.\"\n\n\"I slept half-way down the mountains,\" said the smoker. \"I am a guide\nin these days, but I have not been one long enough to miss a sunrise it\nis no work to reach. My father and brother think I am mad about such\nthings. They would rather stay in their beds. Oh! he is awake, is he?\"\nturning toward The Rat, who had risen on one elbow and was staring at\nhim. \"What is the matter? You look as if you were afraid of me.\"\n\nMarco did not wait for The Rat to recover his breath and speak.\n\n\"I know why he looks at you so,\" he answered for him. \"He is startled.\nYesterday we went to a hair-dresser's shop down below there, and we saw\na man who was almost exactly like you--only--\" he added, looking up,\n\"his eyes were gray and yours are brown.\"\n\n\"He was my twin brother,\" said the guide, puffing at his pipe\ncheerfully. \"My father thought he could make hair-dressers of us both,\nand I tried it for four years. But I always wanted to be climbing the\nmountains and there were not holidays enough. So I cut my hair, and\nwashed the pomade out of it, and broke away. I don't look like a\nhair-dresser now, do I?\"\n\nHe did not. Not at all. But Marco knew him. He was the man. There was no\none on the mountain-top but themselves, and the sun was just showing a\nrim of gold above the farthest and highest giant's shoulders. One need\nnot be afraid to do anything, since there was no one to see or hear.\nMarco slipped the sketch out of the slit in his sleeve. He looked at it\nand he looked at the guide, and then he showed it to him.\n\n\"That is not your brother. It is you!\" he said.\n\nThe man's face changed a little--more than any other face had changed\nwhen its owner had been spoken to. On a mountain-top as the sun rises\none is not afraid.\n\n\"The Lamp is lighted,\" said Marco. \"The Lamp is lighted.\"\n\n\"God be thanked!\" burst forth the man. And he took off his hat and bared\nhis head. Then the rim behind the mountain's shoulder leaped forth into\na golden torrent of splendor.\n\nAnd The Rat stood up, resting his weight on his crutches in utter\nsilence, and stared and stared.\n\n\"That is three!\" said Marco.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nTHE SILVER HORN\n\n\nDuring the next week, which they spent in journeying towards Vienna,\nthey gave the Sign to three different persons at places which were on\nthe way. In a village across the frontier in Bavaria they found a giant\nof an old man sitting on a bench under a tree before his mountain\n\"Gasthaus\" or inn; and when the four words were uttered, he stood up and\nbared his head as the guide had done. When Marco gave the Sign in some\nquiet place to a man who was alone, he noticed that they all did this\nand said their \"God be thanked\" devoutly, as if it were part of some\nreligious ceremony. In a small town a few miles away he had to search\nsome hours before he found a stalwart young shoemaker with bright red\nhair and a horseshoe-shaped scar on his forehead. He was not in his\nworkshop when the boys first passed it, because, as they found out\nlater, he had been climbing a mountain the day before, and had been\ndetained in the descent because his companion had hurt himself.\n\nWhen Marco went in and asked him to measure him for a pair of shoes, he\nwas quite friendly and told them all about it.\n\n\"There are some good fellows who should not climb,\" he said. \"When they\nfind themselves standing on a bit of rock jutting out over emptiness,\ntheir heads begin to whirl round--and then, if they don't turn head over\nheels a few thousand feet, it is because some comrade is near enough to\ndrag them back. There can be no ceremony then and they sometimes get\nhurt--as my friend did yesterday.\"\n\n\"Did you never get hurt yourself?\" The Rat asked.\n\n\"When I was eight years old I did that,\" said the young shoemaker,\ntouching the scar on his forehead. \"But it was not much. My father was a\nguide and took me with him. He wanted me to begin early. There is\nnothing like it--climbing. I shall be at it again. This won't do for me.\nI tried shoemaking because I was in love with a girl who wanted me to\nstay at home. She married another man. I am glad of it. Once a guide,\nalways a guide.\" He knelt down to measure Marco's foot, and Marco bent a\nlittle forward.\n\n\"The Lamp is lighted,\" he said.\n\nThere was no one in the shop, but the door was open and people were\npassing in the narrow street; so the shoemaker did not lift his red\nhead. He went on measuring.\n\n\"God be thanked!\" he said, in a low voice. \"Do you want these shoes\nreally, or did you only want me to take your measure?\"\n\n\"I cannot wait until they are made,\" Marco answered. \"I must go on.\"\n\n\"Yes, you must go on,\" answered the shoemaker. \"But I'll tell you what\nI'll do--I'll make them and keep them. Some great day might come when I\nshall show them to people and swagger about them.\" He glanced round\ncautiously, and then ended, still bending over his measuring. \"They will\nbe called the shoes of the Bearer of the Sign. And I shall say, 'He was\nonly a lad. This was the size of his foot.'\" Then he stood up with a\ngreat smile.\n\n\"There'll be climbing enough to be done now,\" he said, \"and I look to\nsee you again somewhere.\"\n\nWhen the boys went away, they talked it over.\n\n\"The hair-dresser didn't want to be a hair-dresser, and the shoemaker\ndidn't want to make shoes,\" said The Rat. \"They both wanted to be\nmountain-climbers. There are mountains in Samavia and mountains on the\nway to it. You showed them to me on the map.\n\n\"Yes; and secret messengers who can climb anywhere, and cross dangerous\nplaces, and reconnoiter from points no one else can reach, can find out\nthings and give signals other men cannot,\" said Marco.\n\n\"That's what I thought out,\" The Rat answered. \"That was what he meant\nwhen he said, 'There will be climbing enough to be done now.'\"\n\nStrange were the places they went to and curiously unlike each other\nwere the people to whom they carried their message. The most singular of\nall was an old woman who lived in so remote a place that the road which\nwound round and round the mountain, wound round it for miles and miles.\nIt was not a bad road and it was an amazing one to travel, dragged in a\nsmall cart by a mule, when one could be dragged, and clambering slowly\nwith rests between when one could not: the tree-covered precipices one\nlooked down, the tossing whiteness of waterfalls, or the green foaming\nof rushing streams, and the immensity of farm- and village-scattered\nplains spreading themselves to the feet of other mountains shutting them\nin were breath-taking beauties to look down on, as the road mounted and\nwound round and round and higher and higher.\n\n\"How can any one live higher than this?\" said The Rat as they sat on the\nthick moss by the wayside after the mule and cart had left them. \"Look\nat the bare crags looming up above there. Let us look at her again. Her\npicture looked as if she were a hundred years old.\"\n\nMarco took out his hidden sketch. It seemed surely one of the strangest\nthings in the world that a creature as old as this one seemed could\nreach such a place, or, having reached it, could ever descend to the\nworld again to give aid to any person or thing.\n\nHer old face was crossed and recrossed with a thousand wrinkles. Her\nprofile was splendid yet and she had been a beauty in her day. Her eyes\nwere like an eagle's--and not an old eagle's. And she had a long neck\nwhich held her old head high.\n\n\"How could she get here?\" exclaimed The Rat.\n\n\"Those who sent us know, though we don't,\" said Marco. \"Will you sit\nhere and rest while I go on further?\"\n\n\"No!\" The Rat answered stubbornly. \"I didn't train myself to stay\nbehind. But we shall come to bare-rock climbing soon and then I shall be\nobliged to stop,\" and he said the last bitterly. He knew that, if Marco\nhad come alone, he would have ridden in no cart but would have trudged\nupward and onward sturdily to the end of his journey.\n\nBut they did not reach the crags, as they had thought must be\ninevitable. Suddenly half-way to the sky, as it seemed, they came to a\nbend in the road and found themselves mounting into a new green\nworld--an astonishing marvel of a world, with green velvet slopes and\nsoft meadows and thick woodland, and cows feeding in velvet pastures,\nand--as if it had been snowed down from the huge bare mountain crags\nwhich still soared above into heaven--a mysterious, ancient, huddled\nvillage which, being thus snowed down, might have caught among the rocks\nand rested there through all time.\n\nThere it stood. There it huddled itself. And the monsters in the blue\nabove it themselves looked down upon it as if it were an incredible\nthing--this ancient, steep-roofed, hanging-balconied, crumbling cluster\nof human nests, which seemed a thousand miles from the world. Marco and\nThe Rat stood and stared at it. Then they sat down and stared at it.\n\n\"How did it get here?\" The Rat cried.\n\nMarco shook his head. He certainly could see no explanation of its being\nthere. Perhaps some of the oldest villagers could tell stories of how its\nfirst chalets had gathered themselves together.\n\nAn old peasant driving a cow came down a steep path. He looked with a\ndull curiosity at The Rat and his crutches; but when Marco advanced and\nspoke to him in German, he did not seem to understand, but shook his\nhead saying something in a sort of dialect Marco did not know.\n\n\"If they all speak like that, we shall have to make signs when we want\nto ask anything,\" The Rat said. \"What will she speak?\"\n\n\"She will know the German for the Sign or we should not have been sent\nhere,\" answered Marco. \"Come on.\"\n\nThey made their way to the village, which huddled itself together\nevidently with the object of keeping itself warm when through the winter\nmonths the snows strove to bury it and the winds roared down from the\nhuge mountain crags and tried to tear it from among its rocks. The doors\nand windows were few and small, and glimpses of the inside of the houses\nshowed earthen floors and dark rooms. It was plain that it was counted a\nmore comfortable thing to live without light than to let in the cold.\n\nIt was easy enough to reconnoiter. The few people they saw were\nevidently not surprised that strangers who discovered their unexpected\nexistence should be curious and want to look at them and their houses.\n\nThe boys wandered about as if they were casual explorers, who having\nreached the place by chance were interested in all they saw. They went\ninto the little Gasthaus and got some black bread and sausage and some\nmilk. The mountaineer owner was a brawny fellow who understood some\nGerman. He told them that few strangers knew of the village but that\nbold hunters and climbers came for sport. In the forests on the mountain\nsides were bears and, in the high places, chamois. Now and again, some\ngreat gentlemen came with parties of the daring kind--very great\ngentlemen indeed, he said, shaking his head with pride. There was one\nwho had castles in other mountains, but he liked best to come here.\nMarco began to wonder if several strange things might not be true if\ngreat gentlemen sometimes climbed to the mysterious place. But he had\nnot been sent to give the Sign to a great gentleman. He had been sent to\ngive it to an old woman with eyes like an eagle which was young.\n\nHe had a sketch in his sleeve, with that of her face, of her\nsteep-roofed, black-beamed, balconied house. If they walked about a\nlittle, they would be sure to come upon it in this tiny place. Then he\ncould go in and ask her for a drink of water.\n\nThey roamed about for an hour after they left the Gasthaus. They went\ninto the little church and looked at the graveyard and wondered if it\nwas not buried out of all sight in the winter. After they had done this,\nthey sauntered out and walked through the huddled clusters of houses,\nexamining each one as they drew near it and passed.\n\n\"I see it!\" The Rat exclaimed at last. \"It is that very old-looking one\nstanding a little way from the rest. It is not as tumbled down as most\nof them. And there are some red flowers on the balcony.\"\n\n\"Yes! That's it!\" said Marco.\n\nThey walked up to the low black door and, as he stopped on the\nthreshold, Marco took off his cap. He did this because, sitting in the\ndoorway on a low wooden chair, the old, old woman with the eagle eyes\nwas sitting knitting.\n\nThere was no one else in the room and no one anywhere within sight. When\nthe old, old woman looked up at him with her young eagle's eyes, holding\nher head high on her long neck, Marco knew he need not ask for water or\nfor anything else.\n\n\"The Lamp is lighted,\" he said, in his low but strong and clear young\nvoice.\n\nShe dropped her knitting upon her knees and gazed at him a moment in\nsilence. She knew German it was clear, for it was in German she answered\nhim.\n\n\"God be thanked!\" she said. \"Come in, young Bearer of the Sign, and\nbring your friend in with you. I live alone and not a soul is within\nhearing.\"\n\nShe was a wonderful old woman. Neither Marco nor The Rat would live long\nenough to forget the hours they spent in her strange dark house. She\nkept them and made them spend the night with her.\n\n\"It is quite safe,\" she said. \"I live alone since my man fell into the\ncrevasse and was killed because his rope broke when he was trying to\nsave his comrade. So I have two rooms to spare and sometimes climbers\nare glad to sleep in them. Mine is a good warm house and I am well known\nin the village. You are very young,\" she added shaking her head. \"You\nare very young. You must have good blood in your veins to be trusted\nwith this.\"\n\n\"I have my father's blood,\" answered Marco.\n\n\"You are like some one I once saw,\" the old woman said, and her eagle\neyes set themselves hard upon him. \"Tell me your name.\"\n\nThere was no reason why he should not tell it to her.\n\n\"It is Marco Loristan,\" he said.\n\n\"What! It is that!\" she cried out, not loud but low.\n\nTo Marco's amazement she got up from her chair and stood before him,\nshowing what a tall old woman she really was. There was a startled, even\nan agitated, look in her face. And suddenly she actually made a sort of\ncurtsey to him--bending her knee as peasants do when they pass a shrine.\n\n\"It is that!\" she said again. \"And yet they dare let you go on a journey\nlike this! That speaks for your courage and for theirs.\"\n\nBut Marco did not know what she meant. Her strange obeisance made him\nfeel awkward. He stood up because his training had told him that when a\nwoman stands a man also rises.\n\n\"The name speaks for the courage,\" he said, \"because it is my father's.\"\n\nShe watched him almost anxiously.\n\n\"You do not even know!\" she breathed--and it was an exclamation and not\na question.\n\n\"I know what I have been told to do,\" he answered. \"I do not ask\nanything else.\"\n\n\"Who is that?\" she asked, pointing to The Rat.\n\n\"He is the friend my father sent with me,\" said Marco smiling. \"He\ncalled him my aide-de-camp. It was a sort of joke because we had played\nsoldiers together.\"\n\nIt seemed as if she were obliged to collect her thoughts. She stood with\nher hand at her mouth, looking down at the earth floor.\n\n\"God guard you!\" she said at last. \"You are very--very young!\"\n\n\"But all his years,\" The Rat broke in, \"he has been in training for just\nthis thing. He did not know it was training, but it was. A soldier who\nhad been trained for thirteen years would know his work.\"\n\nHe was so eager that he forgot she could not understand English. Marco\ntranslated what he said into German and added: \"What he says is true.\"\n\nShe nodded her head, still with questioning and anxious eyes.\n\n\"Yes. Yes,\" she muttered. \"But you are very young.\" Then she asked in a\nhesitating way:\n\n\"Will you not sit down until I do?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered Marco. \"I would not sit while my mother or grandmother\nstood.\"\n\n\"Then I must sit--and forget,\" she said.\n\nShe passed her hand over her face as though she were sweeping away the\nsudden puzzled trouble in her expression. Then she sat down, as if she\nhad obliged herself to become again the old peasant she had been when\nthey entered.\n\n\"All the way up the mountain you wondered why an old woman should be\ngiven the Sign,\" she said. \"You asked each other how she could be of\nuse.\"\n\nNeither Marco nor The Rat said anything.\n\n\"When I was young and fresh,\" she went on. \"I went to a castle over the\nfrontier to be foster-mother to a child who was born a great noble--one\nwho was near the throne. He loved me and I loved him. He was a strong\nchild and he grew up a great hunter and climber. When he was not ten\nyears old, my man taught him to climb. He always loved these mountains\nbetter than his own. He comes to see me as if he were only a young\nmountaineer. He sleeps in the room there,\" with a gesture over her\nshoulder into the darkness. \"He has great power and, if he chooses to do\na thing, he will do it--just as he will attack the biggest bear or climb\nthe most dangerous peak. He is one who can bring things about. It is\nvery safe to talk in this room.\"\n\nThen all was quite clear. Marco and The Rat understood.\n\nNo more was said about the Sign. It had been given and that was enough.\nThe old woman told them that they must sleep in one of her bedrooms. The\nnext morning one of her neighbors was going down to the valley with a\ncart and he would help them on their way. The Rat knew that she was\nthinking of his crutches and he became restless.\n\n\"Tell her,\" he said to Marco, \"how I have trained myself until I can do\nwhat any one else can. And tell her I am growing stronger every day.\nTell her I'll show her what I can do. Your father wouldn't have let me\ncome as your aide if I hadn't proved to him that I wasn't a cripple.\nTell her. She thinks I'm no use.\"\n\nMarco explained and the old woman listened attentively. When The Rat got\nup and swung himself about up and down the steep path near her house she\nseemed relieved. His extraordinary dexterity and firm swiftness\nevidently amazed her and gave her a confidence she had not felt at\nfirst.\n\n\"If he has taught himself to be like that just for love of your father,\nhe will go to the end,\" she said. \"It is more than one could believe,\nthat a pair of crutches could do such things.\"\n\nThe Rat was pacified and could afterwards give himself up to watching\nher as closely as he wished to. He was soon \"working out\" certain things\nin his mind. What he watched was her way of watching Marco. It was as if\nshe were fascinated and could not keep her eyes from him. She told them\nstories about the mountains and the strangers who came to climb with\nguides or to hunt. She told them about the storms, which sometimes\nseemed about to put an end to the little world among the crags. She\ndescribed the winter when the snow buried them and the strong ones were\nforced to dig out the weak and some lived for days under the masses of\nsoft whiteness, glad to keep their cows or goats in their rooms that\nthey might share the warmth of their bodies. The villages were forced to\nbe good neighbors to each other, for the man who was not ready to dig\nout a hidden chimney or buried door to-day might be left to freeze and\nstarve in his snow tomb next week. Through the worst part of the winter\nno creature from the world below could make way to them to find out\nwhether they were all dead or alive.\n\nWhile she talked, she watched Marco as if she were always asking herself\nsome question about him. The Rat was sure that she liked him and greatly\nadmired his strong body and good looks. It was not necessary for him to\ncarry himself slouchingly in her presence and he looked glowing and\nnoble. There was a sort of reverence in her manner when she spoke to\nhim. She reminded him of Lazarus more than once. When she gave them\ntheir evening meal, she insisted on waiting on him with a certain\nrespectful ceremony. She would not sit at table with him, and The Rat\nbegan to realize that she felt that he himself should be standing to\nserve him.\n\n\"She thinks I ought to stand behind your chair as Lazarus stands behind\nyour father's,\" he said to Marco. \"Perhaps an aide ought to do it. Shall\nI? I believe it would please her.\"\n\n\"A Bearer of the Sign is not a royal person,\" answered Marco. \"My father\nwould not like it--and I should not. We are only two boys.\"\n\nIt was very wonderful when, after their supper was over, they all three\nsat together before the fire.\n\nThe red glow of the bed of wood-coal and the orange yellow of the flame\nfrom the big logs filled the room with warm light, which made a mellow\nbackground for the figure of the old woman as she sat in her low chair\nand told them more and more enthralling stories.\n\nHer eagle eyes glowed and her long neck held her head splendidly high as\nshe described great feats of courage and endurance or almost superhuman\ndaring in aiding those in awesome peril, and, when she glowed most in\nthe telling, they always knew that the hero of the adventure had been\nher foster-child who was the baby born a great noble and near the\nthrone. To her, he was the most splendid and adorable of human beings.\nAlmost an emperor, but so warm and tender of heart that he never forgot\nthe long-past days when she had held him on her knee and told him tales\nof chamois- and bear-hunting, and of the mountain-tops in midwinter.\nHe was her sun-god.\n\n\"Yes! Yes!\" she said. \"'Good Mother,' he calls me. And I bake him a\ncake on the hearth, as I did when he was ten years old and my man was\nteaching him to climb. And when he chooses that a thing shall be\ndone--done it is! He is a great lord.\"\n\nThe flames had died down and only the big bed of red coal made the room\nglow, and they were thinking of going to bed when the old woman started\nvery suddenly, turning her head as if to listen.\n\nMarco and The Rat heard nothing, but they saw that she did and they sat\nso still that each held his breath. So there was utter stillness for a\nfew moments. Utter stillness.\n\nThen they did hear something--a clear silver sound, piercing the pure\nmountain air.\n\nThe old woman sprang upright with the fire of delight in her eyes.\n\n\"It is his silver horn!\" she cried out striking her hands together. \"It\nis his own call to me when he is coming. He has been hunting somewhere\nand wants to sleep in his good bed here. Help me to put on more\nfaggots,\" to The Rat, \"so that he will see the flame of them through the\nopen door as he comes.\"\n\n\"Shall we be in the way?\" said Marco. \"We can go at once.\"\n\nShe was going towards the door to open it and she stopped a moment and\nturned.\n\n\"No, no!\" she said. \"He must see your face. He will want to see it. I\nwant him to see--how young you are.\"\n\nShe threw the door wide open and they heard the silver horn send out its\ngay call again. The brushwood and faggots The Rat had thrown on the\ncoals crackled and sparkled and roared into fine flames, which cast\ntheir light into the road and threw out in fine relief the old figure\nwhich stood on the threshold and looked so tall.\n\nAnd in but a few minutes her great lord came to her. And in his green\nhunting-suit with its green hat and eagle's feather he was as splendid\nas she had said he was. He was big and royal-looking and laughing and\nhe bent and kissed her as if he had been her own son.\n\n\"Yes, good Mother,\" they heard him say. \"I want my warm bed and one of\nyour good suppers. I sent the others to the Gasthaus.\"\n\nHe came into the redly glowing room and his head almost touched the\nblackened rafters. Then he saw the two boys.\n\n\"Who are these, good Mother?\" he asked.\n\nShe lifted his hand and kissed it.\n\n\"They are the Bearers of the Sign,\" she said rather softly. \"'The Lamp\nis lighted.'\"\n\nThen his whole look changed. His laughing face became quite grave and\nfor a moment looked even anxious. Marco knew it was because he was\nstartled to find them only boys. He made a step forward to look at them\nmore closely.\n\n\"The Lamp is lighted! And you two bear the Sign!\" he exclaimed. Marco\nstood out in the fire glow that he might see him well. He saluted with\nrespect.\n\n\"My name is Marco Loristan, Highness,\" he said. \"And my father sent me.\"\n\nThe change which came upon his face then was even greater than at first.\nFor a second, Marco even felt that there was a flash of alarm in it. But\nalmost at once that passed.\n\n\"Loristan is a great man and a great patriot,\" he said. \"If he sent you,\nit is because he knows you are the one safe messenger. He has worked too\nlong for Samavia not to know what he does.\"\n\nMarco saluted again. He knew what it was right to say next.\n\n\"If we have your Highness's permission to retire,\" he said, \"we will\nleave you and go to bed. We go down the mountain at sunrise.\"\n\n\"Where next?\" asked the hunter, looking at him with curious intentness.\n\n\"To Vienna, Highness,\" Marco answered.\n\nHis questioner held out his hand, still with the intent interest in his\neyes.\n\n\"Good night, fine lad,\" he said. \"Samavia has need to vaunt itself on\nits Sign-bearer. God go with you.\"\n\nHe stood and watched him as he went toward the room in which he and his\naide-de-camp were to sleep. The Rat followed him closely. At the little\nback door the old, old woman stood, having opened it for them. As Marco\npassed and bade her good night, he saw that she again made the strange\nobeisance, bending the knee as he went by.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\"HOW SHALL WE FIND HIM?\"\n\n\nIn Vienna they came upon a pageant. In celebration of a century-past\nvictory the Emperor drove in state and ceremony to attend at the great\ncathedral and to do honor to the ancient banners and laurel-wreathed\nstatue of a long-dead soldier-prince. The broad pavements of the huge\nchief thoroughfare were crowded with a cheering populace watching the\nmartial pomp and splendor as it passed by with marching feet, prancing\nhorses, and glitter of scabbard and chain, which all seemed somehow part\nof music in triumphant bursts.\n\nThe Rat was enormously thrilled by the magnificence of the imperial\nplace. Its immense spaces, the squares and gardens, reigned over by\nstatues of emperors, and warriors, and queens made him feel that all\nthings on earth were possible. The palaces and stately piles of\narchitecture, whose surmounting equestrian bronzes ramped high in the\nair clear cut and beautiful against the sky, seemed to sweep out of his\nworld all atmosphere but that of splendid cities down whose broad\navenues emperors rode with waving banners, tramping, jangling soldiery\nbefore and behind, and golden trumpets blaring forth. It seemed as if it\nmust always be like this--that lances and cavalry and emperors would\nnever cease to ride by. \"I should like to stay here a long time,\" he\nsaid almost as if he were in a dream. \"I should like to see it all.\"\n\nHe leaned on his crutches in the crowd and watched the glitter of the\npassing pageant. Now and then he glanced at Marco, who watched also with\na steady eye which, The Rat saw, nothing would escape: How absorbed he\nalways was in the Game! How impossible it was for him to forget it or to\nremember it only as a boy would! Often it seemed that he was not a boy\nat all. And the Game, The Rat knew in these days, was a game no more but\na thing of deep and deadly earnest--a thing which touched kings and\nthrones, and concerned the ruling and swaying of great countries. And\nthey--two lads pushed about by the crowd as they stood and stared at the\nsoldiers--carried with them that which was even now lighting the Lamp.\nThe blood in The Rat's veins ran quickly and made him feel hot as he\nremembered certain thoughts which had forced themselves into his mind\nduring the past weeks. As his brain had the trick of \"working things\nout,\" it had, during the last fortnight at least, been following a\nwonderful even if rather fantastic and feverish fancy. A mere trifle had\nset it at work, but, its labor once begun, things which might have once\nseemed to be trifles appeared so no longer. When Marco was asleep, The\nRat lay awake through thrilled and sometimes almost breathless midnight\nhours, looking backward and recalling every detail of their lives since\nthey had known each other. Sometimes it seemed to him that almost\neverything he remembered--the Game from first to last above all--had\npointed to but one thing. And then again he would all at once feel that\nhe was a fool and had better keep his head steady. Marco, he knew, had\nno wild fancies. He had learned too much and his mind was too well\nbalanced. He did not try to \"work out things.\" He only thought of what\nhe was under orders to do.\n\n\"But,\" said The Rat more than once in these midnight hours, \"if it ever\ncomes to a draw whether he is to be saved or I am, he is the one that\nmust come to no harm. Killing can't take long--and his father sent me\nwith him.\"\n\nThis thought passed through his mind as the tramping feet went by. As a\nsudden splendid burst of approaching music broke upon his ear, a queer\nlook twisted his face. He realized the contrast between this day and\nthat first morning behind the churchyard, when he had sat on his\nplatform among the Squad and looked up and saw Marco in the arch at the\nend of the passage. And because he had been good-looking and had held\nhimself so well, he had thrown a stone at him. Yes--blind gutter-bred\nfool that he'd been:--his first greeting to Marco had been a stone, just\nbecause he was what he was. As they stood here in the crowd in this\nfar-off foreign city, it did not seem as if it could be true that it was\nhe who had done it.\n\nHe managed to work himself closer to Marco's side. \"Isn't it splendid?\"\nhe said, \"I wish I was an emperor myself. I'd have these fellows out\nlike this every day.\" He said it only because he wanted to say\nsomething, to speak, as a reason for getting closer to him. He wanted to\nbe near enough to touch him and feel that they were really together and\nthat the whole thing was not a sort of magnificent dream from which he\nmight awaken to find himself lying on his heap of rags in his corner of\nthe room in Bone Court.\n\nThe crowd swayed forward in its eagerness to see the principal feature\nof the pageant--the Emperor in his carriage. The Rat swayed forward with\nthe rest to look as it passed.\n\nA handsome white-haired and mustached personage in splendid uniform\ndecorated with jeweled orders and with a cascade of emerald-green plumes\nnodding in his military hat gravely saluted the shouting people on\neither side. By him sat a man uniformed, decorated, and emerald-plumed\nalso, but many years younger.\n\nMarco's arm touched The Rat's almost at the same moment that his own\ntouched Marco. Under the nodding plumes each saw the rather tired and\ncynical pale face, a sketch of which was hidden in the slit in Marco's\nsleeve.\n\n\"Is the one who sits with the Emperor an Archduke?\" Marco asked the man\nnearest to him in the crowd. The man answered amiably enough. No, he was\nnot, but he was a certain Prince, a descendant of the one who was the\nhero of the day. He was a great favorite of the Emperor's and was also a\ngreat personage, whose palace contained pictures celebrated throughout\nEurope.\n\n\"He pretends it is only pictures he cares for,\" he went on, shrugging\nhis shoulders and speaking to his wife, who had begun to listen, \"but he\nis a clever one, who amuses himself with things he professes not to\nconcern himself about--big things. It's his way to look bored, and\ninterested in nothing, but it's said he's a wizard for knowing dangerous\nsecrets.\"\n\n\"Does he live at the Hofburg with the Emperor?\" asked the woman, craning\nher neck to look after the imperial carriage.\n\n\"No, but he's often there. The Emperor is lonely and bored too, no\ndoubt, and this one has ways of making him forget his troubles. It's\nbeen told me that now and then the two dress themselves roughly, like\ncommon men, and go out into the city to see what it's like to rub\nshoulders with the rest of the world. I daresay it's true. I should like\nto try it myself once in a while, if I had to sit on a throne and wear a\ncrown.\"\n\nThe two boys followed the celebration to its end. They managed to get\nnear enough to see the entrance to the church where the service was\nheld and to get a view of the ceremonies at the banner-draped and\nlaurel-wreathed statue. They saw the man with the pale face several\ntimes, but he was always so enclosed that it was not possible to get\nwithin yards of him. It happened once, however, that he looked through\na temporary break in the crowding people and saw a dark strong-featured\nand remarkably intent boy's face, whose vivid scrutiny of him caught his\neye. There was something in the fixedness of its attention which caused\nhim to look at it curiously for a few seconds, and Marco met his gaze\nsquarely.\n\n\"Look at me! Look at me!\" the boy was saying to him mentally. \"I have a\nmessage for you. A message!\"\n\nThe tired eyes in the pale face rested on him with a certain growing\nlight of interest and curiosity, but the crowding people moved and the\ntemporary break closed up, so that the two could see each other no more.\nMarco and The Rat were pushed backward by those taller and stronger than\nthemselves until they were on the outskirts of the crowd.\n\n\"Let us go to the Hofburg,\" said Marco. \"They will come back there, and\nwe shall see him again even if we can't get near.\"\n\nTo the Hofburg they made their way through the less crowded streets, and\nthere they waited as near to the great palace as they could get. They\nwere there when, the ceremonies at an end, the imperial carriages\nreturned, but, though they saw their man again, they were at some\ndistance from him and he did not see them.\n\nThen followed four singular days. They were singular days because they\nwere full of tantalizing incidents. Nothing seemed easier than to hear\ntalk of, and see the Emperor's favorite, but nothing was more impossible\nthan to get near to him. He seemed rather a favorite with the populace,\nand the common people of the shopkeeping or laboring classes were given\nto talking freely of him--of where he was going and what he was doing.\nTo-night he would be sure to be at this great house or that, at this\nball or that banquet. There was no difficulty in discovering that he\nwould be sure to go to the opera, or the theatre, or to drive to\nSchönbrunn with his imperial master. Marco and The Rat heard casual\nspeech of him again and again, and from one part of the city to the\nother they followed and waited for him. But it was like chasing a\nwill-o'-the-wisp. He was evidently too brilliant and important a person\nto be allowed to move about alone. There were always people with him who\nseemed absorbed in his languid cynical talk. Marco thought that he never\nseemed to care much for his companions, though they on their part always\nseemed highly entertained by what he was saying. It was noticeable that\nthey laughed a great deal, though he himself scarcely even smiled.\n\n\"He's one of those chaps with the trick of saying witty things as if he\ndidn't see the fun in them himself,\" The Rat summed him up. \"Chaps like\nthat are always cleverer than the other kind.\"\n\n\"He's too high in favor and too rich not to be followed about,\" they\nheard a man in a shop say one day, \"but he gets tired of it. Sometimes,\nwhen he's too bored to stand it any longer, he gives it out that he's\ngone into the mountains somewhere, and all the time he's shut up alone\nwith his pictures in his own palace.\"\n\nThat very night The Rat came in to their attic looking pale and\ndisappointed. He had been out to buy some food after a long and arduous\nday in which they had covered much ground, had seen their man three\ntimes, and each time under circumstances which made him more\ninaccessible than ever. They had come back to their poor quarters both\ntired and ravenously hungry.\n\nThe Rat threw his purchase on to the table and himself into a chair.\n\n\"He's gone to Budapest,\" he said. \"_Now_ how shall we find him?\"\n\nMarco was rather pale also, and for a moment he looked paler. The day\nhad been a hard one, and in their haste to reach places at a long\ndistance from each other they had forgotten their need of food.\n\nThey sat silent for a few moments because there seemed to be nothing to\nsay. \"We are too tired and hungry to be able to think well,\" Marco said\nat last. \"Let us eat our supper and then go to sleep. Until we've had a\nrest, we must 'let go.'\"\n\n\"Yes. There's no good in talking when you're tired,\" The Rat answered a\ntrifle gloomily. \"You don't reason straight. We must 'let go.'\"\n\nTheir meal was simple but they ate well and without words.\n\nEven when they had finished and undressed for the night, they said very\nlittle.\n\n\"Where do our thoughts go when we are asleep?\" The Rat inquired casually\nafter he was stretched out in the darkness. \"They must go somewhere.\nLet's send them to find out what to do next.\"\n\n\"It's not as still as it was on the Gaisberg. You can hear the city\nroaring,\" said Marco drowsily from his dark corner. \"We must make a\nledge--for ourselves.\"\n\nSleep made it for them--deep, restful, healthy sleep. If they had been\nmore resentful of their ill luck and lost labor, it would have come less\neasily and have been less natural. In their talks of strange things they\nhad learned that one great secret of strength and unflagging courage is\nto know how to \"let go\"--to cease thinking over an anxiety until the\nright moment comes. It was their habit to \"let go\" for hours sometimes,\nand wander about looking at places and things--galleries, museums,\npalaces, giving themselves up with boyish pleasure and eagerness to all\nthey saw. Marco was too intimate with the things worth seeing, and The\nRat too curious and feverishly wide-awake to allow of their missing\nmuch.\n\nThe Rat's image of the world had grown until it seemed to know no\nboundaries which could hold its wealth of wonders. He wanted to go on\nand on and see them all.\n\nWhen Marco opened his eyes in the morning, he found The Rat lying\nlooking at him. Then they both sat up in bed at the same time.\n\n\"I believe we are both thinking the same thing,\" Marco said.\n\nThey frequently discovered that they were thinking the same things.\n\n\"So do I,\" answered The Rat. \"It shows how tired we were that we didn't\nthink of it last night.\"\n\n\"Yes, we are thinking the same thing,\" said Marco. \"We have both\nremembered what we heard about his shutting himself up alone with his\npictures and making people believe he had gone away.\"\n\n\"He's in his palace now,\" The Rat announced.\n\n\"Do you feel sure of that, too?\" asked Marco. \"Did you wake up and feel\nsure of it the first thing?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered The Rat. \"As sure as if I'd heard him say it himself.\"\n\n\"So did I,\" said Marco.\n\n\"That's what our thoughts brought back to us,\" said The Rat, \"when we\n'let go' and sent them off last night.\" He sat up hugging his knees and\nlooking straight before him for some time after this, and Marco did not\ninterrupt his meditations.\n\nThe day was a brilliant one, and, though their attic had only one\nwindow, the sun shone in through it as they ate their breakfast. After\nit, they leaned on the window's ledge and talked about the Prince's\ngarden. They talked about it because it was a place open to the public\nand they had walked round it more than once. The palace, which was not a\nlarge one, stood in the midst of it. The Prince was good-natured enough\nto allow quiet and well-behaved people to saunter through. It was not a\nfashionable promenade but a pleasant retreat for people who sometimes\ntook their work or books and sat on the seats placed here and there\namong the shrubs and flowers.\n\n\"When we were there the first time, I noticed two things,\" Marco said.\n\"There is a stone balcony which juts out from the side of the palace\nwhich looks on the Fountain Garden. That day there were chairs on it as\nif the Prince and his visitors sometimes sat there. Near it, there was a\nvery large evergreen shrub and I saw that there was a hollow place\ninside it. If some one wanted to stay in the gardens all night to watch\nthe windows when they were lighted and see if any one came out alone\nupon the balcony, he could hide himself in the hollow place and stay\nthere until the morning.\"\n\n\"Is there room for two inside the shrub?\" The Rat asked.\n\n\"No. I must go alone,\" said Marco.\n\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nA VOICE IN THE NIGHT\n\n\nLate that afternoon there wandered about the gardens two quiet,\ninconspicuous, rather poorly dressed boys. They looked at the palace,\nthe shrubs, and the flower-beds, as strangers usually did, and they sat\non the seats and talked as people were accustomed to seeing boys talk\ntogether. It was a sunny day and exceptionally warm, and there were more\nsaunterers and sitters than usual, which was perhaps the reason why the\n___portier___ at the entrance gates gave such slight notice to the pair that\nhe did not observe that, though two boys came in, only one went out. He\ndid not, in fact, remember, when he saw The Rat swing by on his crutches\nat closing-time, that he had entered in company with a dark-haired lad\nwho walked without any aid. It happened that, when The Rat passed out,\nthe ___portier___ at the entrance was much interested in the aspect of the\nsky, which was curiously threatening. There had been heavy clouds\nhanging about all day and now and then blotting out the sunshine\nentirely, but the sun had refused to retire altogether. Just now,\nhowever, the clouds had piled themselves in thunderous, purplish\nmountains, and the sun had been forced to set behind them.\n\n\"It's been a sort of battle since morning,\" the ___portier___ said. \"There\nwill be some crashes and cataracts to-night.\" That was what The Rat had\nthought when they had sat in the Fountain Garden on a seat which gave\nthem a good view of the balcony and the big evergreen shrub, which they\nknew had the hollow in the middle, though its circumference was so\nimposing. \"If there should be a big storm, the evergreen will not save\nyou much, though it may keep off the worst,\" The Rat said. \"I wish there\nwas room for two.\"\n\nHe would have wished there was room for two if he had seen Marco\nmarching to the stake. As the gardens emptied, the boys rose and walked\nround once more, as if on their way out. By the time they had sauntered\ntoward the big evergreen, nobody was in the Fountain Garden, and the\nlast loiterers were moving toward the arched stone entrance to the\nstreets.\n\nWhen they drew near one side of the evergreen, the two were together.\nWhen The Rat swung out on the other side of it, he was alone! No one\nnoticed that anything had happened; no one looked back. So The Rat swung\ndown the walks and round the flower-beds and passed into the street. And\nthe ___portier___ looked at the sky and made his remark about the \"crashes\"\nand \"cataracts.\"\n\nAs the darkness came on, the hollow in the shrub seemed a very safe\nplace. It was not in the least likely that any one would enter the\nclosed gardens; and if by rare chance some servant passed through, he\nwould not be in search of people who wished to watch all night in the\nmiddle of an evergreen instead of going to bed and to sleep. The hollow\nwas well inclosed with greenery, and there was room to sit down when one\nwas tired of standing.\n\nMarco stood for a long time because, by doing so, he could see plainly\nthe windows opening on the balcony if he gently pushed aside some\nflexible young boughs. He had managed to discover in his first visit to\nthe gardens that the windows overlooking the Fountain Garden were those\nwhich belonged to the Prince's own suite of rooms. Those which opened on\nto the balcony lighted his favorite apartment, which contained his\nbest-loved books and pictures and in which he spent most of his secluded\nleisure hours.\n\nMarco watched these windows anxiously. If the Prince had not gone to\nBudapest,--if he were really only in retreat, and hiding from his gay\nworld among his treasures,--he would be living in his favorite rooms and\nlights would show themselves. And if there were lights, he might pass\nbefore a window because, since he was inclosed in his garden, he need\nnot fear being seen. The twilight deepened into darkness and, because of\nthe heavy clouds, it was very dense. Faint gleams showed themselves in\nthe lower part of the palace, but none was lighted in the windows Marco\nwatched. He waited so long that it became evident that none was to be\nlighted at all. At last he loosed his hold on the young boughs and,\nafter standing a few moments in thought, sat down upon the earth in the\nmidst of his embowered tent. The Prince was not in his retreat; he was\nprobably not in Vienna, and the rumor of his journey to Budapest had no\ndoubt been true. So much time lost through making a mistake--but it was\nbest to have made the venture. Not to have made it would have been to\nlose a chance. The entrance was closed for the night and there was no\ngetting out of the gardens until they were opened for the next day. He\nmust stay in his hiding-place until the time when people began to come\nand bring their books and knitting and sit on the seats. Then he could\nstroll out without attracting attention. But he had the night before him\nto spend as best he could. That would not matter at all. He could tuck\nhis cap under his head and go to sleep on the ground. He could command\nhimself to waken once every half-hour and look for the lights. He would\nnot go to sleep until it was long past midnight--so long past that there\nwould not be one chance in a hundred that anything could happen. But the\nclouds which made the night so dark were giving forth low rumbling\ngrowls. At intervals a threatening gleam of light shot across them and a\nsudden swish of wind rushed through the trees in the garden. This\nhappened several times, and then Marco began to hear the patter of\nraindrops. They were heavy and big drops, but few at first, and then\nthere was a new and more powerful rush of wind, a jagged dart of light\nin the sky, and a tremendous crash. After that the clouds tore\nthemselves open and poured forth their contents in floods. After the\nprotracted struggle of the day it all seemed to happen at once, as if a\nhorde of huge lions had at one moment been let loose: flame after flame\nof lightning, roar and crash and sharp reports of thunder, shrieks of\nhurricane wind, torrents of rain, as if some tidal-wave of the skies had\ngathered and rushed and burst upon the earth. It was such a storm as\npeople remember for a lifetime and which in few lifetimes is seen at\nall.\n\nMarco stood still in the midst of the rage and flooding, blinding roar\nof it. After the first few minutes he knew he could do nothing to shield\nhimself. Down the garden paths he heard cataracts rushing. He held his\ncap pressed against his eyes because he seemed to stand in the midst of\ndarting flames. The crashes, cannon reports and thunderings, and the\njagged streams of light came so close to one another that he seemed\ndeafened as well as blinded. He wondered if he should ever be able to\nhear human voices again when it was over. That he was drenched to the\nskin and that the water poured from his clothes as if he were himself a\ncataract was so small a detail that he was scarcely aware of it. He\nstood still, bracing his body, and waited. If he had been a Samavian\nsoldier in the trenches and such a storm had broken upon him and his\ncomrades, they could only have braced themselves and waited. This was\nwhat he found himself thinking when the tumult and downpour were at\ntheir worst. There were men who had waited in the midst of a rain of\nbullets.\n\nIt was not long after this thought had come to him that there occurred\nthe first temporary lull in the storm. Its fury perhaps reached its\nheight and broke at that moment. A yellow flame had torn its jagged way\nacross the heavens, and an earth-rending crash had thundered itself into\nrumblings which actually died away before breaking forth again. Marco\ntook his cap from his eyes and drew a long breath. He drew two long\nbreaths. It was as he began drawing a third and realizing the strange\nfeeling of the almost stillness about him that he heard a new kind of\nsound at the side of the garden nearest his hiding-place. It sounded\nlike the creak of a door opening somewhere in the wall behind the laurel\nhedge. Some one was coming into the garden by a private entrance. He\npushed aside the young boughs again and tried to see, but the darkness\nwas too dense. Yet he could hear if the thunder would not break again.\nThere was the sound of feet on the wet gravel, the footsteps of more\nthan one person coming toward where he stood, but not as if afraid of\nbeing heard; merely as if they were at liberty to come in by what\nentrance they chose. Marco remained very still. A sudden hope gave him a\nshock of joy. If the man with the tired face chose to hide himself from\nhis acquaintances, he might choose to go in and out by a private\nentrance. The footsteps drew near, crushing the wet gravel, passed by,\nand seemed to pause somewhere near the balcony; and them flame lit up\nthe sky again and the thunder burst forth once more.\n\nBut this was its last great peal. The storm was at an end. Only fainter\nand fainter rumblings and mutterings and paler and paler darts followed.\nEven they were soon over, and the cataracts in the paths had rushed\nthemselves silent. But the darkness was still deep.\n\nIt was deep to blackness in the hollow of the evergreen. Marco stood in\nit, streaming with rain, but feeling nothing because he was full of\nthought. He pushed aside his greenery and kept his eyes on the place in\nthe blackness where the windows must be, though he could not see them.\nIt seemed that he waited a long time, but he knew it only seemed so\nreally. He began to breathe quickly because he was waiting for\nsomething.\n\nSuddenly he saw exactly where the windows were--because they were all\nlighted!\n\nHis feeling of relief was great, but it did not last very long. It was\ntrue that something had been gained in the certainty that his man had\nnot left Vienna. But what next? It would not be so easy to follow him if\nhe chose only to go out secretly at night. What next? To spend the rest\nof the night watching a lighted window was not enough. To-morrow night\nit might not be lighted. But he kept his gaze fixed upon it. He tried to\nfix all his will and thought-power on the person inside the room.\nPerhaps he could reach him and make him listen, even though he would not\nknow that any one was speaking to him. He knew that thoughts were strong\nthings. If angry thoughts in one man's mind will create anger in the\nmind of another, why should not sane messages cross the line?\n\n\"I must speak to you. I must speak to you!\" he found himself saying in a\nlow intense voice. \"I am outside here waiting. Listen! I must speak to\nyou!\"\n\nHe said it many times and kept his eyes fixed upon the window which\nopened on to the balcony. Once he saw a man's figure cross the room, but\nhe could not be sure who it was. The last distant rumblings of thunder\nhad died away and the clouds were breaking. It was not long before the\ndark mountainous billows broke apart, and a brilliant full moon showed\nherself sailing in the rift, suddenly flooding everything with light.\nParts of the garden were silver white, and the tree shadows were like\nblack velvet. A silvery lance pierced even into the hollow of Marco's\nevergreen and struck across his face.\n\nPerhaps it was this sudden change which attracted the attention of those\ninside the balconied room. A man's figure appeared at the long windows.\nMarco saw now that it was the Prince. He opened the windows and stepped\nout on to the balcony.\n\n\"It is all over,\" he said quietly. And he stood with his face lifted,\nlooking at the great white sailing moon.\n\nHe stood very still and seemed for the moment to forget the world and\nhimself. It was a wonderful, triumphant queen of a moon. But something\nbrought him back to earth. A low, but strong and clear, boy-voice came\nup to him from the garden path below.\n\n\"The Lamp is lighted. The Lamp is lighted,\" it said, and the words\nsounded almost as if some one were uttering a prayer. They seemed to\ncall to him, to arrest him, to draw him.\n\nHe stood still a few seconds in dead silence. Then he bent over the\nbalustrade. The moonlight had not broken the darkness below.\n\n\"That is a boy's voice,\" he said in a low tone, \"but I cannot see who is\nspeaking.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is a boy's voice,\" it answered, in a way which somehow moved\nhim, because it was so ardent. \"It is the son of Stefan Loristan. The\nLamp is lighted.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"It is the son of Stefan Loristan. The Lamp is lighted!\"]\n\n\"Wait. I am coming down to you,\" the Prince said.\n\nIn a few minutes Marco heard a door open gently not far from where he\nstood. Then the man he had been following so many days appeared at his\nside.\n\n\"How long have you been here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Before the gates closed. I hid myself in the hollow of the big shrub\nthere, Highness,\" Marco answered.\n\n\"Then you were out in the storm?\"\n\n\"Yes, Highness.\"\n\nThe Prince put his hand on the boy's shoulder. \"I cannot see you--but\nit is best to stand in the shadow. You are drenched to the skin.\"\n\n\"I have been able to give your Highness--the Sign,\" Marco whispered. \"A\nstorm is nothing.\"\n\nThere was a silence. Marco knew that his companion was pausing to turn\nsomething over in his mind.\n\n\"So-o?\" he said slowly, at length. \"The Lamp is lighted. And _you_ are\nsent to bear the Sign.\" Something in his voice made Marco feel that he\nwas smiling.\n\n\"What a race you are! What a race--you Samavian Loristans!\"\n\nHe paused as if to think the thing over again.\n\n\"I want to see your face,\" he said next. \"Here is a tree with a shaft of\nmoonlight striking through the branches. Let us step aside and stand\nunder it.\"\n\nMarco did as he was told. The shaft of moonlight fell upon his uplifted\nface and showed its young strength and darkness, quite splendid for the\nmoment in a triumphant glow of joy in obstacles overcome. Raindrops hung\non his hair, but he did not look draggled, only very wet and\npicturesque. He had reached his man. He had given the Sign.\n\nThe Prince looked him over with interested curiosity.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said in his cool, rather dragging voice. \"You are the son of\nStefan Loristan. Also you must be taken care of. You must come with me.\nI have trained my household to remain in its own quarters until I\nrequire its service. I have attached to my own apartments a good safe\nlittle room where I sometimes keep people. You can dry your clothes and\nsleep there. When the gardens are opened again, the rest will be easy.\"\n\nBut though he stepped out from under the trees and began to move towards\nthe palace in the shadow, Marco noticed that he moved hesitatingly, as\nif he had not quite decided what he should do. He stopped rather\nsuddenly and turned again to Marco, who was following him.\n\n\"There is some one in the room I just now left,\" he said, \"an old\nman--whom it might interest to see you. It might also be a good thing\nfor him to feel interest in you. I choose that he shall see you--as you\nare.\"\n\n\"I am at your command, Highness,\" Marco answered. He knew his companion\nwas smiling again.\n\n\"You have been in training for more centuries than you know,\" he said;\n\"and your father has prepared you to encounter the unexpected without\nsurprise.\"\n\nThey passed under the balcony and paused at a low stone doorway hidden\nbehind shrubs. The door was a beautiful one, Marco saw when it was\nopened, and the corridor disclosed was beautiful also, though it had an\nair of quiet and aloofness which was not so much secret as private. A\nperfect though narrow staircase mounted from it to the next floor. After\nascending it, the Prince led the way through a short corridor and\nstopped at the door at the end of it. \"We are going in here,\" he said.\n\nIt was a wonderful room--the one which opened on to the balcony. Each\npiece of furniture in it, the hangings, the tapestries, and pictures on\nthe wall were all such as might well have found themselves adorning a\nmuseum. Marco remembered the common report of his escort's favorite\namusement of collecting wonders and furnishing his house with the things\nothers exhibited only as marvels of art and handicraft. The place was\nrich and mellow with exquisitely chosen beauties.\n\nIn a massive chair upon the hearth sat a figure with bent head. It was a\ntall old man with white hair and moustache. His elbows rested upon the\narm of his chair and he leaned his forehead on his hand as if he were\nweary.\n\nMarco's companion crossed the room and stood beside him, speaking in a\nlowered voice. Marco could not at first hear what he said. He himself\nstood quite still, waiting. The white-haired man lifted his head and\nlistened. It seemed as though almost at once he was singularly\ninterested. The lowered voice was slightly raised at last and Marco\nheard the last two sentences:\n\n\"The only son of Stefan Loristan. Look at him.\"\n\nThe old man in the chair turned slowly and looked, steadily, and with\nquestioning curiosity touched with grave surprise. He had keen and clear\nblue eyes.\n\nThen Marco, still erect and silent, waited again. The Prince had merely\nsaid to him, \"an old man whom it might interest to see you.\" He had\nplainly intended that, whatsoever happened, he must make no outward sign\nof seeing more than he had been told he would see--\"an old man.\" It was\nfor him to show no astonishment or recognition. He had been brought here\nnot to see but to be seen. The power of remaining still under scrutiny,\nwhich The Rat had often envied him, stood now in good stead because he\nhad seen the white head and tall form not many days before, surmounted\nby brilliant emerald plumes, hung with jeweled decorations, in the royal\ncarriage, escorted by banners, and helmets, and following troops whose\ntramping feet kept time to bursts of military music while the populace\nbared their heads and cheered.\n\n\"He is like his father,\" this personage said to the Prince. \"But if any\none but Loristan had sent him--His looks please me.\" Then suddenly to\nMarco, \"You were waiting outside while the storm was going on?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Marco answered.\n\nThen the two exchanged some words still in the lowered voice.\n\n\"You read the news as you made your journey?\" he was asked. \"You know\nhow Samavia stands?\"\n\n\"She does not stand,\" said Marco. \"The Iarovitch and the Maranovitch\nhave fought as hyenas fight, until each has torn the other into\nfragments--and neither has blood or strength left.\"\n\nThe two glanced at each other.\n\n\"A good simile,\" said the older person. \"You are right. If a strong\nparty rose--and a greater power chose not to interfere--the country\nmight see better days.\" He looked at him a few moments longer and then\nwaved his hand kindly.\n\n\"You are a fine Samavian,\" he said. \"I am glad of that. You may go. Good\nnight.\"\n\nMarco bowed respectfully and the man with the tired face led him out of\nthe room.\n\nIt was just before he left him in the small quiet chamber in which he\nwas to sleep that the Prince gave him a final curious glance. \"I\nremember now,\" he said. \"In the room, when you answered the question\nabout Samavia, I was sure that I had seen you before. It was the day of\nthe celebration. There was a break in the crowd and I saw a boy looking\nat me. It was you.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Marco, \"I have followed you each time you have gone out\nsince then, but I could never get near enough to speak. To-night seemed\nonly one chance in a thousand.\"\n\n\"You are doing your work more like a man than a boy,\" was the next\nspeech, and it was made reflectively. \"No man could have behaved more\nperfectly than you did just now, when discretion and composure were\nnecessary.\" Then, after a moment's pause, \"He was deeply interested and\ndeeply pleased. Good night.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the gardens had been thrown open the next morning and people were\npassing in and out again, Marco passed out also. He was obliged to tell\nhimself two or three times that he had not wakened from an amazing\ndream. He quickened his pace after he had crossed the street, because he\nwanted to get home to the attic and talk to The Rat. There was a narrow\nside-street it was necessary for him to pass through if he wished to\nmake a short cut. As he turned into it, he saw a curious figure leaning\non crutches against a wall. It looked damp and forlorn, and he wondered\nif it could be a beggar. It was not. It was The Rat, who suddenly saw\nwho was approaching and swung forward. His face was pale and haggard and\nhe looked worn and frightened. He dragged off his cap and spoke in a\nvoice which was hoarse as a crow's.\n\n\"God be thanked!\" he said. \"God be thanked!\" as people always said it\nwhen they received the Sign, alone. But there was a kind of anguish in\nhis voice as well as relief.\n\n\"Aide-de-camp!\" Marco cried out--The Rat had begged him to call him so.\n\"What have you been doing? How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"Ever since I left you last night,\" said The Rat clutching tremblingly\nat his arm as if to make sure he was real. \"If there was not room for\ntwo in the hollow, there was room for one in the street. Was it my place\nto go off duty and leave you alone--was it?\"\n\n\"You were out in the storm?\"\n\n\"Weren't you?\" said The Rat fiercely. \"I huddled against the wall as\nwell as I could. What did I care? Crutches don't prevent a fellow\nwaiting. I wouldn't have left you if you'd given me orders. And that\nwould have been mutiny. When you did not come out as soon as the gates\nopened, I felt as if my head got on fire. How could I know what had\nhappened? I've not the nerve and backbone you have. I go half mad.\" For\na second or so Marco did not answer. But when he put his hand on the\ndamp sleeve, The Rat actually started, because it seemed as though he\nwere looking into the eyes of Stefan Loristan.\n\n\"You look just like your father!\" he exclaimed, in spite of himself.\n\"How tall you are!\"\n\n\"When you are near me,\" Marco said, in Loristan's own voice, \"when you\nare near me, I feel--I feel as if I were a royal prince attended by an\narmy. You _are_ my army.\" And he pulled off his cap with quick boyishness\nand added, \"God be thanked!\"\n\nThe sun was warm in the attic window when they reached their lodging,\nand the two leaned on the rough sill as Marco told his story. It took\nsome time to relate; and when he ended, he took an envelope from his\npocket and showed it to The Rat. It contained a flat package of money.\n\n\"He gave it to me just before he opened the private door,\" Marco\nexplained. \"And he said to me, 'It will not be long now. After Samavia,\ngo back to London as quickly as you can--_as quickly as you can_!'\"\n\n\"I wonder--what he meant?\" The Rat said, slowly. A tremendous thought\nhad shot through his mind. But it was not a thought he could speak of to\nMarco.\n\n\"I cannot tell. I thought that it was for some reason he did not expect\nme to know,\" Marco said. \"We will do as he told us. As quickly as we\ncan.\" They looked over the newspapers, as they did every day. All that\ncould be gathered from any of them was that the opposing armies of\nSamavia seemed each to have reached the culmination of disaster and\nexhaustion. Which party had the power left to take any final step which\ncould call itself a victory, it was impossible to say. Never had a\ncountry been in a more desperate case.\n\n\"It is the time!\" said The Rat, glowering over his map. \"If the Secret\nParty rises suddenly now, it can take Melzarr almost without a blow.\nIt can sweep through the country and disarm both armies. They're\nweakened--they're half starved--they're bleeding to death; they _want_ to\nbe disarmed. Only the Iarovitch and the Maranovitch keep on with the\nstruggle because each is fighting for the power to tax the people and\nmake slaves of them. If the Secret Party does not rise, the people will,\nand they'll rush on the palaces and kill every Maranovitch and Iarovitch\nthey find. And serve them right!\"\n\n\"Let us spend the rest of the day in studying the road-map again,\" said\nMarco. \"To-night we must be on the way to Samavia!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nACROSS THE FRONTIER\n\n\nThat one day, a week later, two tired and travel-worn boy-mendicants\nshould drag themselves with slow and weary feet across the frontier line\nbetween Jiardasia and Samavia, was not an incident to awaken suspicion\nor even to attract attention. War and hunger and anguish had left the\ncountry stunned and broken. Since the worst had happened, no one was\ncurious as to what would befall them next. If Jiardasia herself had\nbecome a foe, instead of a friendly neighbor, and had sent across the\nborder galloping hordes of soldiery, there would only have been more\nshrieks, and home-burnings, and slaughter which no one dare resist. But,\nso far, Jiardasia had remained peaceful. The two boys--one of them on\ncrutches--had evidently traveled far on foot. Their poor clothes were\ndusty and travel-stained, and they stopped and asked for water at the\nfirst hut across the line. The one who walked without crutches had some\ncoarse bread in a bag slung over his shoulder, and they sat on the\nroadside and ate it as if they were hungry. The old grandmother who\nlived alone in the hut sat and stared at them without any curiosity. She\nmay have vaguely wondered why any one crossed into Samavia in these\ndays. But she did not care to know their reason. Her big son had lived\nin a village which belonged to the Maranovitch and he had been called\nout to fight for his lords. He had not wanted to fight and had not known\nwhat the quarrel was about, but he was forced to obey. He had kissed his\nhandsome wife and four sturdy children, blubbering aloud when he left\nthem. His village and his good crops and his house must be left behind.\nThen the Iarovitch swept through the pretty little cluster of homesteads\nwhich belonged to their enemy. They were mad with rage because they had\nmet with great losses in a battle not far away, and, as they swooped\nthrough, they burned and killed, and trampled down fields and vineyards.\nThe old woman's son never saw either the burned walls of his house or\nthe bodies of his wife and children, because he had been killed himself\nin the battle for which the Iarovitch were revenging themselves. Only\nthe old grandmother who lived in the hut near the frontier line and\nstared vacantly at the passers-by remained alive. She wearily gazed at\npeople and wondered why she did not hear news from her son and her\ngrandchildren. But that was all.\n\nWhen the boys were over the frontier and well on their way along the\nroads, it was not difficult to keep out of sight if it seemed necessary.\nThe country was mountainous and there were deep and thick forests by the\nway--forests so far-reaching and with such thick undergrowth that\nfull-grown men could easily have hidden themselves. It was because of\nthis, perhaps, that this part of the country had seen little fighting.\nThere was too great opportunity for secure ambush for a foe. As the two\ntravelers went on, they heard of burned villages and towns destroyed,\nbut they were towns and villages nearer Melzarr and other\nfortress-defended cities, or they were in the country surrounding the\ncastles and estates of powerful nobles and leaders. It was true, as\nMarco had said to the white-haired personage, that the Maranovitch and\nIarovitch had fought with the savageness of hyenas until at last the\nforces of each side lay torn and bleeding, their strength, their\nresources, their supplies exhausted.\n\nEach day left them weaker and more desperate. Europe looked on with\nsmall interest in either party but with growing desire that the disorder\nshould end and cease to interfere with commerce. All this and much more\nMarco and The Rat knew, but, as they made their cautious way through\nbyways of the maimed and tortured little country, they learned other\nthings. They learned that the stories of its beauty and fertility were\nnot romances. Its heaven-reaching mountains, its immense plains of rich\nverdure on which flocks and herds might have fed by thousands, its\nsplendor of deep forest and broad clear rushing rivers had a primeval\nmajesty such as the first human creatures might have found on earth in\nthe days of the Garden of Eden. The two boys traveled through forest and\nwoodland when it was possible to leave the road. It was safe to thread a\nway among huge trees and tall ferns and young saplings. It was not\nalways easy but it was safe. Sometimes they saw a charcoal-burner's hut\nor a shelter where a shepherd was hiding with the few sheep left to him.\nEach man they met wore the same look of stony suffering in his face;\nbut, when the boys begged for bread and water, as was their habit, no\none refused to share the little he had. It soon became plain to them\nthat they were thought to be two young fugitives whose homes had\nprobably been destroyed and who were wandering about with no thought but\nthat of finding safety until the worst was over. That one of them\ntraveled on crutches added to their apparent helplessness, and that he\ncould not speak the language of the country made him more an object of\npity. The peasants did not know what language he spoke. Sometimes a\nforeigner came to find work in this small town or that. The poor lad\nmight have come to the country with his father and mother and then have\nbeen caught in the whirlpool of war and tossed out on the world\nparent-less. But no one asked questions. Even in their desolation they\nwere silent and noble people who were too courteous for curiosity.\n\n\"In the old days they were simple and stately and kind. All doors were\nopen to travelers. The master of the poorest hut uttered a blessing and\na welcome when a stranger crossed his threshold. It was the custom of\nthe country,\" Marco said. \"I read about it in a book of my father's.\nAbout most of the doors the welcome was carved in stone. It was\nthis--'The Blessing of the Son of God, and Rest within these Walls.'\"\n\n\"They are big and strong,\" said The Rat. \"And they have good faces. They\ncarry themselves as if they had been drilled--both men and women.\"\n\nIt was not through the blood-drenched part of the unhappy land their way\nled them, but they saw hunger and dread in the villages they passed.\nCrops which should have fed the people had been taken from them for the\nuse of the army; flocks and herds had been driven away, and faces were\ngaunt and gray. Those who had as yet only lost crops and herds knew that\nhomes and lives might be torn from them at any moment. Only old men and\nwomen and children were left to wait for any fate which the chances of\nwar might deal out to them.\n\nWhen they were given food from some poor store, Marco would offer a\nlittle money in return. He dare not excite suspicion by offering much.\nHe was obliged to let it be imagined that in his flight from his ruined\nhome he had been able to snatch at and secrete some poor hoard which\nmight save him from starvation. Often the women would not take what he\noffered. Their journey was a hard and hungry one. They must make it all\non foot and there was little food to be found. But each of them knew how\nto live on scant fare. They traveled mostly by night and slept among the\nferns and undergrowth through the day. They drank from running brooks\nand bathed in them. Moss and ferns made soft and sweet-smelling beds,\nand trees roofed them. Sometimes they lay long and talked while they\nrested. And at length a day came when they knew they were nearing their\njourney's end.\n\n\"It is nearly over now,\" Marco said, after they had thrown themselves\ndown in the forest in the early hours of one dewy morning. \"He said\n'After Samavia, go back to London as quickly as you can--_as quickly as\nyou can_.' He said it twice. As if--something were going to happen.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will happen more suddenly than we think--the thing he\nmeant,\" answered The Rat.\n\nSuddenly he sat up on his elbow and leaned towards Marco.\n\n\"We are in Samavia!\" he said \"We two are in Samavia! And we are near the\nend!\"\n\nMarco rose on his elbow also. He was very thin as a result of hard\ntravel and scant feeding. His thinness made his eyes look immense and\nblack as pits. But they burned and were beautiful with their own fire.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, breathing quickly. \"And though we do not know what the\nend will be, we have obeyed orders. The Prince was next to the last one.\nThere is only one more. The old priest.\"\n\n\"I have wanted to see him more than I have wanted to see any of the\nothers,\" The Rat said.\n\n\"So have I,\" Marco answered. \"His church is built on the side of this\nmountain. I wonder what he will say to us.\"\n\nBoth had the same reason for wanting to see him. In his youth he had\nserved in the monastery over the frontier--the one which, till it was\ndestroyed in a revolt, had treasured the five-hundred-year-old story of\nthe beautiful royal lad brought to be hidden among the brotherhood by\nthe ancient shepherd. In the monastery the memory of the Lost Prince was\nas the memory of a saint. It had been told that one of the early\nbrothers, who was a decorator and a painter, had made a picture of him\nwith a faint halo shining about his head. The young acolyte who had\nserved there must have heard wonderful legends. But the monastery had\nbeen burned, and the young acolyte had in later years crossed the\nfrontier and become the priest of a few mountaineers whose little church\nclung to the mountain side. He had worked hard and faithfully and was\nworshipped by his people. Only the secret Forgers of the Sword knew that\nhis most ardent worshippers were those with whom he prayed and to whom\nhe gave blessings in dark caverns under the earth, where arms piled\nthemselves and men with dark strong faces sat together in the dim light\nand laid plans and wrought schemes.\n\nThis Marco and The Rat did not know as they talked of their desire to\nsee him.\n\n\"He may not choose to tell us anything,\" said Marco. \"When we have given\nhim the Sign, he may turn away and say nothing as some of the others\ndid. He may have nothing to say which we should hear. Silence may be the\norder for him, too.\"\n\nIt would not be a long or dangerous climb to the little church on the\nrock. They could sleep or rest all day and begin it at twilight. So\nafter they had talked of the old priest and had eaten their black bread,\nthey settled themselves to sleep under cover of the thick tall ferns.\n\nIt was a long and deep sleep which nothing disturbed. So few human\nbeings ever climbed the hill, except by the narrow rough path leading to\nthe church, that the little wild creatures had not learned to be afraid\nof them. Once, during the afternoon, a hare hopping along under the\nferns to make a visit stopped by Marco's head, and, after looking at him\na few seconds with his lustrous eyes, began to nibble the ends of his\nhair. He only did it from curiosity and because he wondered if it might\nbe a new kind of grass, but he did not like it and stopped nibbling\nalmost at once, after which he looked at it again, moving the soft\nsensitive end of his nose rapidly for a second or so, and then hopped\naway to attend to his own affairs. A very large and handsome green\nstag-beetle crawled from one end of The Rat's crutches to the other,\nbut, having done it, he went away also. Two or three times a bird,\nsearching for his dinner under the ferns, was surprised to find the two\nsleeping figures, but, as they lay so quietly, there seemed nothing to\nbe frightened about. A beautiful little field mouse running past\ndiscovered that there were crumbs lying about and ate all she could find\non the moss. After that she crept into Marco's pocket and found some\nexcellent ones and had quite a feast. But she disturbed nobody and the\nboys slept on.\n\nIt was a bird's evening song which awakened them both. The bird alighted\non the branch of a tree near them and her trill was rippling clear and\nsweet. The evening air had freshened and was fragrant with hillside\nscents. When Marco first rolled over and opened his eyes, he thought the\nmost delicious thing on earth was to waken from sleep on a hillside at\nevening and hear a bird singing. It seemed to make exquisitely real to\nhim the fact that he was in Samavia--that the Lamp was lighted and his\nwork was nearly done. The Rat awakened when he did, and for a few\nminutes both lay on their backs without speaking. At last Marco said,\n\"The stars are coming out. We can begin to climb, Aide-de-camp.\"\n\nThen they both got up and looked at each other.\n\n\"The last one!\" The Rat said. \"To-morrow we shall be on our way back to\nLondon--Number 7 Philibert Place. After all the places we've been\nto--what will it look like?\"\n\n\"It will be like wakening out of a dream,\" said Marco. \"It's not\nbeautiful--Philibert Place. But _he_ will be there,\" And it was as if a\nlight lighted itself in his face and shone through the very darkness of\nit.\n\nAnd The Rat's face lighted in almost exactly the same way. And he pulled\noff his cap and stood bare-headed. \"We've obeyed orders,\" he said.\n\"We've not forgotten one. No one has noticed us, no one has thought of\nus. We've blown through the countries as if we had been grains of dust.\"\n\nMarco's head was bared, too, and his face was still shining. \"God be\nthanked!\" he said. \"Let us begin to climb.\"\n\nThey pushed their way through the ferns and wandered in and out through\ntrees until they found the little path. The hill was thickly clothed\nwith forest and the little path was sometimes dark and steep; but they\nknew that, if they followed it, they would at last come out to a place\nwhere there were scarcely any trees at all, and on a crag they would\nfind the tiny church waiting for them. The priest might not be there.\nThey might have to wait for him, but he would be sure to come back for\nmorning Mass and for vespers, wheresoever he wandered between times.\n\nThere were many stars in the sky when at last a turn of the path showed\nthem the church above them. It was little and built of rough stone. It\nlooked as if the priest himself and his scattered flock might have\nbroken and carried or rolled bits of the hill to put it together. It had\nthe small, round, mosque-like summit the Turks had brought into Europe\nin centuries past. It was so tiny that it would hold but a very small\ncongregation--and close to it was a shed-like house, which was of course\nthe priest's.\n\nThe two boys stopped on the path to look at it.\n\n\"There is a candle burning in one of the little windows,\" said Marco.\n\n\"There is a well near the door--and some one is beginning to draw\nwater,\" said The Rat, next. \"It is too dark to see who it is. Listen!\"\n\nThey listened and heard the bucket descend on the chains, and splash in\nthe water. Then it was drawn up, and it seemed some one drank long. Then\nthey saw a dim figure move forward and stand still. Then they heard a\nvoice begin to pray aloud, as if the owner, being accustomed to utter\nsolitude, did not think of earthly hearers.\n\n\"Come,\" Marco said. And they went forward.\n\nBecause the stars were so many and the air so clear, the priest heard\ntheir feet on the path, and saw them almost as soon as he heard them. He\nended his prayer and watched them coming. A lad on crutches, who moved\nas lightly and easily as a bird--and a lad who, even yards away, was\nnoticeable for a bearing of his body which was neither haughty nor proud\nbut set him somehow aloof from every other lad one had ever seen. A\nmagnificent lad--though, as he drew near, the starlight showed his face\nthin and his eyes hollow as if with fatigue or hunger.\n\n\"And who is this one?\" the old priest murmured to himself. \"_Who_?\"\n\nMarco drew up before him and made a respectful reverence. Then he lifted\nhis black head, squared his shoulders and uttered his message for the\nlast time.\n\n\"The Lamp is lighted, Father,\" he said. \"The Lamp is lighted.\"\n\nThe old priest stood quite still and gazed into his face. The next\nmoment he bent his head so that he could look at him closely. It seemed\nalmost as if he were frightened and wanted to make sure of something. At\nthe moment it flashed through The Rat's mind that the old, old woman on\nthe mountain-top had looked frightened in something the same way.\n\n\"I am an old man,\" he said. \"My eyes are not good. If I had a\nlight\"--and he glanced towards the house.\n\nIt was The Rat who, with one whirl, swung through the door and seized\nthe candle. He guessed what he wanted. He held it himself so that the\nflare fell on Marco's face.\n\nThe old priest drew nearer and nearer. He gasped for breath. \"You are\nthe son of Stefan Loristan!\" he cried. \"It is _his son_ who brings the\nSign.\"\n\nHe fell upon his knees and hid his face in his hands. Both the boys\nheard him sobbing and praying--praying and sobbing at once.\n\nThey glanced at each other. The Rat was bursting with excitement, but he\nfelt a little awkward also and wondered what Marco would do. An old\nfellow on his knees, crying, made a chap feel as if he didn't know what\nto say. Must you comfort him or must you let him go on?\n\nMarco only stood quite still and looked at him with understanding and\ngravity.\n\n\"Yes, Father,\" he said. \"I am the son of Stefan Loristan, and I have\ngiven the Sign to all. You are the last one. The Lamp is lighted. I\ncould weep for gladness, too.\"\n\nThe priest's tears and prayers ended. He rose to his feet--a\nrugged-faced old man with long and thick white hair which fell on his\nshoulders--and smiled at Marco while his eyes were still wet.\n\n\"You have passed from one country to another with the message?\" he said.\n\"You were under orders to say those four words?\"\n\n\"Yes, Father,\" answered Marco.\n\n\"That was all? You were to say no more?\"\n\n\"I know no more. Silence has been the order since I took my oath of\nallegiance when I was a child. I was not old enough to fight, or serve,\nor reason about great things. All I could do was to be silent, and to\ntrain myself to remember, and be ready when I was called. When my father\nsaw I was ready, he trusted me to go out and give the Sign. He told me\nthe four words. Nothing else.\"\n\nThe old man watched him with a wondering face.\n\n\"If Stefan Loristan does not know best,\" he said, \"who does?\"\n\n\"He always knows,\" answered Marco proudly. \"Always.\" He waved his hand\nlike a young king toward The Rat. He wanted each man they met to\nunderstand the value of The Rat. \"He chose for me this companion,\" he\nadded. \"I have done nothing alone.\"\n\n\"He let me call myself his aide-de-camp!\" burst forth The Rat. \"I would\nbe cut into inch-long strips for him.\"\n\nMarco translated.\n\nThen the priest looked at The Rat and slowly nodded his head. \"Yes,\" he\nsaid. \"He knew best. He always knows best. That I see.\"\n\n\"How did you know I was my father's son?\" asked Marco. \"You have seen\nhim?\"\n\n\"No,\" was the answer; \"but I have seen a picture which is said to be his\nimage--and you are the picture's self. It is, indeed, a strange thing\nthat two of God's creatures should be so alike. There is a purpose in\nit.\" He led them into his bare small house and made them rest, and drink\ngoat's milk, and eat food. As he moved about the hut-like place, there\nwas a mysterious and exalted look on his face.\n\n\"You must be refreshed before we leave here,\" he said at last. \"I am\ngoing to take you to a place hidden in the mountains where there are men\nwhose hearts will leap at the sight of you. To see you will give them\nnew power and courage and new resolve. To-night they meet as they or\ntheir ancestors have met for centuries, but now they are nearing the end\nof their waiting. And I shall bring them the son of Stefan Loristan, who\nis the Bearer of the Sign!\"\n\nThey ate the bread and cheese and drank the goat's milk he gave them,\nbut Marco explained that they did not need rest as they had slept all\nday. They were prepared to follow him when he was ready.\n\nThe last faint hint of twilight had died into night and the stars were\nat their thickest when they set out together. The white-haired old man\ntook a thick knotted staff in his hand and led the way. He knew it well,\nthough it was a rugged and steep one with no track to mark it. Sometimes\nthey seemed to be walking around the mountain, sometimes they were\nclimbing, sometimes they dragged themselves over rocks or fallen trees,\nor struggled through almost impassable thickets; more than once they\ndescended into ravines and, almost at the risk of their lives, clambered\nand drew themselves with the aid of the undergrowth up the other side.\nThe Rat was called upon to use all his prowess, and sometimes Marco and\nthe priest helped him across obstacles with the aid of his crutch.\n\n\"Haven't I shown to-night whether I'm a cripple or not?\" he said once to\nMarco. \"You can tell _him_ about this, can't you? And that the crutches\nhelped instead of being in the way?\"\n\nThey had been out nearly two hours when they came to a place where the\nundergrowth was thick and a huge tree had fallen crashing down among it\nin some storm. Not far from the tree was an outcropping rock. Only the\ntop of it was to be seen above the heavy tangle.\n\nThey had pushed their way through the jungle of bushes and young\nsaplings, led by their companion. They did not know where they would be\nled next and were supposed to push forward further when the priest\nstopped by the outcropping rock. He stood silent a few minutes--quite\nmotionless--as if he were listening to the forest and the night. But\nthere was utter stillness. There was not even a breeze to stir a leaf,\nor a half-wakened bird to sleepily chirp.\n\nHe struck the rock with his staff--twice, and then twice again.\n\nMarco and The Rat stood with bated breath.\n\nThey did not wait long. Presently each of them found himself leaning\nforward, staring with almost unbelieving eyes, not at the priest or his\nstaff, but at _the rock itself_!\n\nIt was moving! Yes, it moved. The priest stepped aside and it slowly\nturned, as if worked by a lever. As it turned, it gradually revealed a\nchasm of darkness dimly lighted, and the priest spoke to Marco. \"There\nare hiding-places like this all through Samavia,\" he said. \"Patience and\nmisery have waited long in them. They are the caverns of the Forgers of\nthe Sword. Come!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\n\"IT IS THE LOST PRINCE! IT IS IVOR!\"\n\n\nMany times since their journey had begun the boys had found their hearts\nbeating with the thrill and excitement of things. The story of which\ntheir lives had been a part was a pulse-quickening experience. But as\nthey carefully made their way down the steep steps leading seemingly\ninto the bowels of the earth, both Marco and The Rat felt as though the\nold priest must hear the thudding in their young sides.\n\n\"'The Forgers of the Sword.' Remember every word they say,\" The Rat\nwhispered, \"so that you can tell it to me afterwards. Don't forget\nanything! I wish I knew Samavian.\"\n\nAt the foot of the steps stood the man who was evidently the sentinel\nwho worked the lever that turned the rock. He was a big burly peasant\nwith a good watchful face, and the priest gave him a greeting and a\nblessing as he took from him the lantern he held out.\n\nThey went through a narrow and dark passage, and down some more steps,\nand turned a corner into another corridor cut out of rock and earth. It\nwas a wider corridor, but still dark, so that Marco and The Rat had\nwalked some yards before their eyes became sufficiently accustomed to\nthe dim light to see that the walls themselves seemed made of arms\nstacked closely together.\n\n\"The Forgers of the Sword!\" The Rat was unconsciously mumbling to\nhimself, \"The Forgers of the Sword!\"\n\nIt must have taken years to cut out the rounding passage they threaded\ntheir way through, and longer years to forge the solid, bristling walls.\nBut The Rat remembered the story the stranger had told his drunken\nfather, of the few mountain herdsmen who, in their savage grief and\nwrath over the loss of their prince, had banded themselves together with\na solemn oath which had been handed down from generation to generation.\nThe Samavians were a long-memoried people, and the fact that their\npassion must be smothered had made it burn all the more fiercely. Five\nhundred years ago they had first sworn their oath; and kings had come\nand gone, had died or been murdered, and dynasties had changed, but the\nForgers of the Sword had not changed or forgotten their oath or wavered\nin their belief that some time--some time, even after the long dark\nyears--the soul of their Lost Prince would be among them once more, and\nthat they would kneel at the feet and kiss the hands of him for whose\nbody that soul had been reborn. And for the last hundred years their\nnumber and power and their hiding places had so increased that Samavia\nwas at last honeycombed with them. And they only waited,\nbreathless,--for the Lighting of the Lamp.\n\nThe old priest knew how breathlessly, and he knew what he was bringing\nthem. Marco and The Rat, in spite of their fond boy-imaginings, were\nnot quite old enough to know how fierce and full of flaming eagerness\nthe breathless waiting of savage full-grown men could be. But there was\na tense-strung thrill in knowing that they who were being led to them\nwere the Bearers of the Sign. The Rat went hot and cold; he gnawed his\nfingers as he went. He could almost have shrieked aloud, in the\nintensity of his excitement, when the old priest stopped before a big\nblack door!\n\nMarco made no sound. Excitement or danger always made him look tall and\nquite pale. He looked both now.\n\nThe priest touched the door, and it opened.\n\nThey were looking into an immense cavern. Its walls and roof were lined\nwith arms--guns, swords, bayonets, javelins, daggers, pistols, every\nweapon a desperate man might use. The place was full of men, who turned\ntowards the door when it opened. They all made obeisance to the priest,\nbut Marco realized almost at the same instant that they started on\nseeing that he was not alone.\n\nThey were a strange and picturesque crowd as they stood under their\ncanopy of weapons in the lurid torchlight. Marco saw at once that they\nwere men of all classes, though all were alike roughly dressed. They\nwere huge mountaineers, and plainsmen young and mature in years. Some of\nthe biggest were men with white hair but with bodies of giants, and with\ndetermination in their strong jaws. There were many of these, Marco saw,\nand in each man's eyes, whether he were young or old, glowed a steady\nunconquered flame. They had been beaten so often, they had been\noppressed and robbed, but in the eyes of each one was this unconquered\nflame which, throughout all the long tragedy of years had been handed\ndown from father to son. It was this which had gone on through\ncenturies, keeping its oath and forging its swords in the caverns of the\nearth, and which to-day was--waiting.\n\nThe old priest laid his hand on Marco's shoulder, and gently pushed him\nbefore him through the crowd which parted to make way for them. He did\nnot stop until the two stood in the very midst of the circle, which fell\nback gazing wonderingly. Marco looked up at the old man because for\nseveral seconds he did not speak. It was plain that he did not speak\nbecause he also was excited, and could not. He opened his lips and his\nvoice seemed to fail him. Then he tried again and spoke so that all\ncould hear--even the men at the back of the gazing circle.\n\n\"My children,\" he said, \"this is the son of Stefan Loristan, and he\ncomes to bear the Sign. My son,\" to Marco, \"speak!\"\n\nThen Marco understood what he wished, and also what he felt. He felt it\nhimself, that magnificent uplifting gladness, as he spoke, holding his\nblack head high and lifting his right hand.\n\n\"The Lamp is Lighted, brothers!\" he cried. \"The Lamp is Lighted!\"\n\nThen The Rat, who stood apart, watching, thought that the strange world\nwithin the cavern had gone mad! Wild smothered cries broke forth, men\ncaught each other in passionate embrace, they fell upon their knees,\nthey clutched one another sobbing, they wrung each other's hands, they\nleaped into the air. It was as if they could not bear the joy of hearing\nthat the end of their waiting had come at last. They rushed upon Marco,\nand fell at his feet. The Rat saw big peasants kissing his shoes, his\nhands, every scrap of his clothing they could seize. The wild circle\nswayed and closed upon him until The Rat was afraid. He did not know\nthat, overpowered by this frenzy of emotion, his own excitement was\nmaking him shake from head to foot like a leaf, and that tears were\nstreaming down his cheeks. The swaying crowd hid Marco from him, and he\nbegan to fight his way towards him because his excitement increased with\nfear. The ecstasy-frenzied crowd of men seemed for the moment to have\nalmost ceased to be sane. Marco was only a boy. They did not know how\nfiercely they were pressing upon him and keeping away the very air.\n\n\"Don't kill him! Don't kill him!\" yelled The Rat, struggling forward.\n\"Stand back, you fools! I'm his aide-de-camp! Let me pass!\"\n\nAnd though no one understood his English, one or two suddenly remembered\nthey had seen him enter with the priest and so gave way. But just then\nthe old priest lifted his hand above the crowd, and spoke in a voice of\nstern command.\n\n\"Stand back, my children!\" he cried. \"Madness is not the homage you must\nbring to the son of Stefan Loristan. Obey! Obey!\" His voice had a power\nin it that penetrated even the wildest herdsmen. The frenzied mass\nswayed back and left space about Marco, whose face The Rat could at last\nsee. It was very white with emotion, and in his eyes there was a look\nwhich was like awe.\n\nThe Rat pushed forward until he stood beside him. He did not know that\nhe almost sobbed as he spoke.\n\n\"I'm your aide-de-camp,\" he said. \"I'm going to stand here! Your father\nsent me! I'm under orders! I thought they'd crush you to death.\"\n\nHe glared at the circle about them as if, instead of worshippers\ndistraught with adoration, they had been enemies. The old priest seeing\nhim, touched Marco's arm.\n\n\"Tell him he need not fear,\" he said. \"It was only for the first few\nmoments. The passion of their souls drove them wild. They are your\nslaves.\"\n\n\"Those at the back might have pushed the front ones on until they\ntrampled you under foot in spite of themselves!\" The Rat persisted.\n\n\"No,\" said Marco. \"They would have stopped if I had spoken.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\t   \n\"Why didn't you speak then?\" snapped The Rat.\n\n\"All they felt was for Samavia, and for my father,\" Marco said, \"and for\nthe Sign. I felt as they did.\"\n\nThe Rat was somewhat softened. It was true, after all. How could he have\ntried to quell the outbursts of their worship of Loristan--of the\ncountry he was saving for them--of the Sign which called them to\nfreedom? He could not.\n\nThen followed a strange and picturesque ceremonial. The priest went\nabout among the encircling crowd and spoke to one man after\nanother--sometimes to a group. A larger circle was formed. As the pale\nold man moved about, The Rat felt as if some religious ceremony were\ngoing to be performed. Watching it from first to last, he was thrilled\nto the core.\n\nAt the end of the cavern a block of stone had been cut out to look like\nan altar. It was covered with white, and against the wall above it hung\na large picture veiled by a curtain. From the roof there swung before it\nan ancient lamp of metal suspended by chains. In front of the altar was\na sort of stone dais. There the priest asked Marco to stand, with his\naide-de-camp on the lower level in attendance. A knot of the biggest\nherdsmen went out and returned. Each carried a huge sword which had\nperhaps been of the earliest made in the dark days gone by. The bearers\nformed themselves into a line on either side of Marco. They raised their\nswords and formed a pointed arch above his head and a passage twelve men\nlong. When the points first clashed together The Rat struck himself hard\nupon his breast. His exultation was too keen to endure. He gazed at\nMarco standing still--in that curiously splendid way in which both he\nand his father _could_ stand still--and wondered how he could do it. He\nlooked as if he were prepared for any strange thing which could happen\nto him--because he was \"under orders.\" The Rat knew that he was doing\nwhatsoever he did merely for his father's sake. It was as if he felt\nthat he was representing his father, though he was a mere boy; and that\nbecause of this, boy as he was, he must bear himself nobly and remain\noutwardly undisturbed.\n\nAt the end of the arch of swords, the old priest stood and gave a sign\nto one man after another. When the sign was given to a man he walked\nunder the arch to the dais, and there knelt and, lifting Marco's hand to\nhis lips, kissed it with passionate fervor. Then he returned to the\nplace he had left. One after another passed up the aisle of swords, one\nafter another knelt, one after the other kissed the brown young hand,\nrose and went away. Sometimes The Rat heard a few words which sounded\nalmost like a murmured prayer, sometimes he heard a sob as a shaggy head\nbent, again and again he saw eyes wet with tears. Once or twice Marco\nspoke a few Samavian words, and the face of the man spoken to flamed\nwith joy. The Rat had time to see, as Marco had seen, that many of the\nfaces were not those of peasants. Some of them were clear cut and subtle\nand of the type of scholars or nobles. It took a long time for them all\nto kneel and kiss the lad's hand, but no man omitted the ceremony; and\nwhen at last it was at an end, a strange silence filled the cavern. They\nstood and gazed at each other with burning eyes.\n\nThe priest moved to Marco's side, and stood near the altar. He leaned\nforward and took in his hand a cord which hung from the veiled\npicture--he drew it and the curtain fell apart. There seemed to stand\ngazing at them from between its folds a tall kingly youth with deep eyes\nin which the stars of God were stilly shining, and with a smile\nwonderful to behold. Around the heavy locks of his black hair the long\ndead painter of missals had set a faint glow of light like a halo.\n\n\"Son of Stefan Loristan,\" the old priest said, in a shaken voice, \"it is\nthe Lost Prince! It is Ivor!\"\n\nThen every man in the room fell on his knees. Even the men who had\nupheld the archway of swords dropped their weapons with a crash and\nknelt also. He was their saint--this boy! Dead for five hundred years,\nhe was their saint still.\n\n\"Ivor! Ivor!\" the voices broke into a heavy murmur. \"Ivor! Ivor!\" as if\nthey chanted a litany.\n\nMarco started forward, staring at the picture, his breath caught in his\nthroat, his lips apart.\n\n\"But--but--\" he stammered, \"but if my father were as young as he is--he\nwould be _like_ him!\"\n\n\"When you are as old as he is, _you_ will be like him--_you_!\" said the\npriest. And he let the curtain fall.\n\nThe Rat stood staring with wide eyes from Marco to the picture and from\nthe picture to Marco. And he breathed faster and faster and gnawed his\nfinger ends. But he did not utter a word. He could not have done it, if\nhe tried.\n\nThen Marco stepped down from the dais as if he were in a dream, and the\nold man followed him. The men with swords sprang to their feet and made\ntheir archway again with a new clash of steel. The old man and the boy\npassed under it together. Now every man's eyes were fixed on Marco. At\nthe heavy door by which he had entered, he stopped and turned to meet\ntheir glances. He looked very young and thin and pale, but suddenly his\nfather's smile was lighted in his face. He said a few words in Samavian\nclearly and gravely, saluted, and passed out.\n\n\"What did you say to them?\" gasped The Rat, stumbling after him as the\ndoor closed behind them and shut in the murmur of impassioned sound.\n\n\"There was only one thing to say,\" was the answer. \"They are men--I am\nonly a boy. I thanked them for my father, and told them he would\nnever--never forget.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\"EXTRA! EXTRA! EXTRA!\"\n\n\nIt was raining in London--pouring. It had been raining for two weeks,\nmore or less, generally more. When the train from Dover drew in at\nCharing Cross, the weather seemed suddenly to have considered that it\nhad so far been too lenient and must express itself much more\nvigorously. So it had gathered together its resources and poured them\nforth in a deluge which surprised even Londoners.\n\nThe rain so beat against and streamed down the windows of the\nthird-class carriage in which Marco and The Rat sat that they could not\nsee through them.\n\nThey had made their homeward journey much more rapidly than they had\nmade the one on which they had been outward bound. It had of course\ntaken them some time to tramp back to the frontier, but there had been\nno reason for stopping anywhere after they had once reached the\nrailroads. They had been tired sometimes, but they had slept heavily on\nthe wooden seats of the railway carriages. Their one desire was to get\nhome. No. 7 Philibert Place rose before them in its noisy dinginess as\nthe one desirable spot on earth. To Marco it held his father. And it was\nLoristan alone that The Rat saw when he thought of it. Loristan as he\nwould look when he saw him come into the room with Marco, and stand up\nand salute, and say: \"I have brought him back, sir. He has carried out\nevery single order you gave him--every single one. So have I.\" So he\nhad. He had been sent as his companion and attendant, and he had been\nfaithful in every thought. If Marco would have allowed him, he would\nhave waited upon him like a servant, and have been proud of the service.\nBut Marco would never let him forget that they were only two boys and\nthat one was of no more importance than the other. He had secretly even\nfelt this attitude to be a sort of grievance. It would have been more\nlike a game if one of them had been the mere servitor of the other, and\nif that other had blustered a little, and issued commands, and demanded\nsacrifices. If the faithful vassal could have been wounded or cast into\na dungeon for his young commander's sake, the adventure would have been\nmore complete. But though their journey had been full of wonders and\nrich with beauties, though the memory of it hung in The Rat's mind like\na background of tapestry embroidered in all the hues of the earth with\nall the splendors of it, there had been no dungeons and no wounds. After\nthe adventure in Munich their unimportant boyishness had not even been\nobserved by such perils as might have threatened them. As The Rat had\nsaid, they had \"blown like grains of dust\" through Europe and had been\nas nothing. And this was what Loristan had planned, this was what his\ngrave thought had wrought out. If they had been men, they would not have\nbeen so safe.\n\nFrom the time they had left the old priest on the hillside to begin\ntheir journey back to the frontier, they both had been given to long\nsilences as they tramped side by side or lay on the moss in the forests.\nNow that their work was done, a sort of reaction had set in. There were\nno more plans to be made and no more uncertainties to contemplate. They\nwere on their way back to No. 7 Philibert Place--Marco to his father,\nThe Rat to the man he worshipped. Each of them was thinking of many\nthings. Marco was full of longing to see his father's face and hear his\nvoice again. He wanted to feel the pressure of his hand on his\nshoulder--to be sure that he was real and not a dream. This last was\nbecause during this homeward journey everything that had happened often\nseemed to be a dream. It had all been so wonderful--the climber standing\nlooking down at them the morning they awakened on the Gaisburg; the\nmountaineer shoemaker measuring his foot in the small shop; the old, old\nwoman and her noble lord; the Prince with his face turned upward as he\nstood on the balcony looking at the moon; the old priest kneeling and\nweeping for joy; the great cavern with the yellow light upon the crowd\nof passionate faces; the curtain which fell apart and showed the still\neyes and the black hair with the halo about it! Now that they were left\nbehind, they all seemed like things he had dreamed. But he had not\ndreamed them; he was going back to tell his father about them. And how\n_good_ it would be to feel his hand on his shoulder!\n\nThe Rat gnawed his finger ends a great deal. His thoughts were more wild\nand feverish than Marco's. They leaped forward in spite of him. It was\nno use to pull himself up and tell himself that he was a fool. Now that\nall was over, he had time to be as great a fool as he was inclined to\nbe. But how he longed to reach London and stand face to face with\nLoristan! The sign was given. The Lamp was lighted. What would happen\nnext? His crutches were under his arms before the train drew up.\n\n\"We're there! We're there!\" he cried restlessly to Marco. They had no\nluggage to delay them. They took their bags and followed the crowd along\nthe platform. The rain was rattling like bullets against the high\nglassed roof. People turned to look at Marco, seeing the glow of\nexultant eagerness in his face. They thought he must be some boy coming\nhome for the holidays and going to make a visit at a place he delighted\nin. The rain was dancing on the pavements when they reached the\nentrance.\n\n\"A cab won't cost much,\" Marco said, \"and it will take us quickly.\"\n\nThey called one and got into it. Each of them had flushed cheeks, and\nMarco's eyes looked as if he were gazing at something a long way\noff--gazing at it, and wondering.\n\n\"We've come back!\" said The Rat, in an unsteady voice. \"We've been--and\nwe've come back!\" Then suddenly turning to look at Marco, \"Does it ever\nseem to you as if, perhaps, it--it wasn't true?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Marco answered, \"but it was true. And it's done.\" Then he added\nafter a second or so of silence, just what The Rat had said to himself,\n\"What next?\" He said it very low.\n\nThe way to Philibert Place was not long. When they turned into the\nroaring, untidy road, where the busses and drays and carts struggled\npast each other with their loads, and the tired-faced people hurried in\ncrowds along the pavement, they looked at them all feeling that they had\nleft their dream far behind indeed. But they were at home.\n\nIt was a good thing to see Lazarus open the door and stand waiting\nbefore they had time to get out of the cab. Cabs stopped so seldom\nbefore houses in Philibert Place that the inmates were always prompt to\nopen their doors. When Lazarus had seen this one stop at the broken iron\ngate, he had known whom it brought. He had kept an eye on the windows\nfaithfully for many a day--even when he knew that it was too soon, even\nif all was well, for any travelers to return.\n\nHe bore himself with an air more than usually military and his salute\nwhen Marco crossed the threshold was formal stateliness itself. But his\ngreeting burst from his heart.\n\n\"God be thanked!\" he said in his deep growl of joy. \"God be thanked!\"\n\nWhen Marco put forth his hand, he bent his grizzled head and kissed it\ndevoutly.\n\n\"God be thanked!\" he said again.\n\n\"My father?\" Marco began, \"my father is out?\" If he had been in the\nhouse, he knew he would not have stayed in the back sitting-room.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Lazarus, \"will you come with me into his room? You, too,\nsir,\" to The Rat. He had never said \"sir\" to him before.\n\nHe opened the door of the familiar room, and the boys entered. The room\nwas empty.\n\nMarco did not speak; neither did The Rat. They both stood still in the\nmiddle of the shabby carpet and looked up at the old soldier. Both had\nsuddenly the same feeling that the earth had dropped from beneath their\nfeet. Lazarus saw it and spoke fast and with tremor. He was almost as\nagitated as they were.\n\n\"He left me at your service--at your command\"--he began.\n\n\"Left you?\" said Marco.\n\n\"He left us, all three, under orders--to _wait_,\" said Lazarus. \"The\nMaster has gone.\"\n\nThe Rat felt something hot rush into his eyes. He brushed it away that\nhe might look at Marco's face. The shock had changed it very much. Its\nglowing eager joy had died out, it had turned paler and his brows were\ndrawn together. For a few seconds he did not speak at all, and, when he\ndid speak, The Rat knew that his voice was steady only because he willed\nthat it should be so.\n\n\"If he has gone,\" he said, \"it is because he had a strong reason. It was\nbecause he also was under orders.\"\n\n\"He said that you would know that,\" Lazarus answered. \"He was called in\nsuch haste that he had not a moment in which to do more than write a few\nwords. He left them for you on his desk there.\"\n\nMarco walked over to the desk and opened the envelope which was lying\nthere. There were only a few lines on the sheet of paper inside and they\nhad evidently been written in the greatest haste. They were these:\n\n\"The Life of my life--for Samavia.\"\n\n\"He was called--to Samavia,\" Marco said, and the thought sent his blood\nrushing through his veins. \"He has gone to Samavia!\"\n\nLazarus drew his hand roughly across his eyes and his voice shook and\nsounded hoarse.\n\n\"There has been great disaffection in the camps of the Maranovitch,\" he\nsaid. \"The remnant of the army has gone mad. Sir, silence is still the\norder, but who knows--who knows? God alone.\"\n\nHe had not finished speaking before he turned his head as if listening\nto sounds in the road. They were the kind of sounds which had broken up\nThe Squad, and sent it rushing down the passage into the street to seize\non a newspaper. There was to be heard a commotion of newsboys shouting\nriotously some startling piece of news which had called out an \"Extra.\"\n\nThe Rat heard it first and dashed to the front door. As he opened it a\nnewsboy running by shouted at the topmost power of his lungs the news he\nhad to sell: \"Assassination of King Michael Maranovitch by his own\nsoldiers! Assassination of the Maranovitch! Extra! Extra! Extra!\"\n\nWhen The Rat returned with a newspaper, Lazarus interposed between him\nand Marco with great and respectful ceremony. \"Sir,\" he said to Marco,\n\"I am at your command, but the Master left me with an order which I was\nto repeat to you. He requested you _not_ to read the newspapers until he\nhimself could see you again.\"\n\nBoth boys fell back.\n\n\"Not read the papers!\" they exclaimed together.\n\nLazarus had never before been quite so reverential and ceremonious.\n\n\"Your pardon, sir,\" he said. \"I may read them at your orders, and report\nsuch things as it is well that you should know. There have been dark\ntales told and there may be darker ones. He asked that you would not\nread for yourself. If you meet again--when you meet again\"--he corrected\nhimself hastily--\"when you meet again, he says you will understand. I am\nyour servant. I will read and answer all such questions as I can.\"\n\nThe Rat handed him the paper and they returned to the back room\ntogether.\n\n\"You shall tell us what he would wish us to hear,\" Marco said.\n\nThe news was soon told. The story was not a long one as exact details\nhad not yet reached London. It was briefly that the head of the\nMaranovitch party had been put to death by infuriated soldiers of his\nown army. It was an army drawn chiefly from a peasantry which did not\nlove its leaders, or wish to fight, and suffering and brutal treatment\nhad at last roused it to furious revolt.\n\n\"What next?\" said Marco.\n\n\"If I were a Samavian--\" began The Rat and then he stopped.\n\nLazarus stood biting his lips, but staring stonily at the carpet. Not\nThe Rat alone but Marco also noted a grim change in him. It was grim\nbecause it suggested that he was holding himself under an iron control.\nIt was as if while tortured by anxiety he had sworn not to allow himself\nto look anxious and the resolve set his jaw hard and carved new lines in\nhis rugged face. Each boy thought this in secret, but did not wish to\nput it into words. If he was anxious, he could only be so for one\nreason, and each realized what the reason must be. Loristan had gone to\nSamavia--to the torn and bleeding country filled with riot and danger.\nIf he had gone, it could only have been because its danger called him\nand he went to face it at its worst. Lazarus had been left behind to\nwatch over them. Silence was still the order, and what he knew he could\nnot tell them, and perhaps he knew little more than that a great life\nmight be lost.\n\nBecause his master was absent, the old soldier seemed to feel that he\nmust comfort himself with a greater ceremonial reverance than he had\never shown before. He held himself within call, and at Marco's orders,\nas it had been his custom to hold himself with regard to Loristan. The\nceremonious service even extended itself to The Rat, who appeared to\nhave taken a new place in his mind. He also seemed now to be a person to\nbe waited upon and replied to with dignity and formal respect.\n\nWhen the evening meal was served, Lazarus drew out Loristan's chair at\nthe head of the table and stood behind it with a majestic air.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said to Marco, \"the Master requested that you take his seat at\nthe table until--while he is not with you.\"\n\nMarco took the seat in silence.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt two o'clock in the morning, when the roaring road was still, the\nlight from the street lamp, shining into the small bedroom, fell on two\npale boy faces. The Rat sat up on his sofa bed in the old way with his\nhands clasped round his knees. Marco lay flat on his hard pillow.\nNeither of them had been to sleep and yet they had not talked a great\ndeal. Each had secretly guessed a good deal of what the other did not\nsay.\n\n\"There is one thing we must remember,\" Marco had said, early in the\nnight. \"We must not be afraid.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered The Rat, almost fiercely, \"we must not be afraid.\"\n\n\"We are tired; we came back expecting to be able to tell it all to him.\nWe have always been looking forward to that. We never thought once that\nhe might be gone. And he _was_ gone. Did you feel as if--\" he turned\ntowards the sofa, \"as if something had struck you on the chest?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" The Rat answered heavily. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"We weren't ready,\" said Marco. \"He had never gone before; but we ought\nto have known he might some day be--called. He went because he was\ncalled. He told us to wait. We don't know what we are waiting for, but\nwe know that we must not be afraid. To let ourselves be _afraid_ would be\nbreaking the Law.\"\n\n\"The Law!\" groaned The Rat, dropping his head on his hands, \"I'd\nforgotten about it.\"\n\n\"Let us remember it,\" said Marco. \"This is the time. 'Hate not. _Fear_\nnot!'\" He repeated the last words again and again. \"Fear not! Fear\nnot,\" he said. \"_Nothing_ can harm him.\"\n\nThe Rat lifted his head, and looked at the bed sideways.\n\n\"Did you think--\" he said slowly--\"did you _ever_ think that perhaps _he_\nknew where the descendant of the Lost Prince was?\"\n\nMarco answered even more slowly.\n\n\"If any one knew--surely he might. He has known so much,\" he said.\n\n\"Listen to this!\" broke forth The Rat. \"I believe he has gone to _tell_\nthe people. If he does--if he could show them--all the country would run\nmad with joy. It wouldn't be only the Secret Party. All Samavia would\nrise and follow any flag he chose to raise. They've prayed for the Lost\nPrince for five hundred years, and if they believed they'd got him once\nmore, they'd fight like madmen for him. But there would not be any one\nto fight. They'd _all_ want the same thing! If they could see the man with\nIvor's blood in his veins, they'd feel he had come back to them--risen\nfrom the dead. They'd believe it!\"\n\nHe beat his fists together in his frenzy of excitement. \"It's the time!\nIt's the time!\" he cried. \"No man could let such a chance go by! He _must_\ntell them--he _must_. That _must_ be what he's gone for. He knows--he\nknows--he's always known!\" And he threw himself back on his sofa and\nflung his arms over his face, lying there panting.\n\n\"If it is the time,\" said Marco in a low, strained voice--\"if it is, and\nhe knows--he will tell them.\" And he threw his arms up over his own face\nand lay quite still.\n\nNeither of them said another word, and the street lamp shone in on them\nas if it were waiting for something to happen. But nothing happened. In\ntime they were asleep.\n\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\n'TWIXT NIGHT AND MORNING\n\n\nAfter this, they waited. They did not know what they waited for, nor\ncould they guess even vaguely how the waiting would end. All that\nLazarus could tell them he told. He would have been willing to stand\nrespectfully for hours relating to Marco the story of how the period of\ntheir absence had passed for his Master and himself. He told how\nLoristan had spoken each day of his son, how he had often been pale with\nanxiousness, how in the evenings he had walked to and fro in his room,\ndeep in thought, as he looked down unseeingly at the carpet.\n\n\"He permitted me to talk of you, sir,\" Lazarus said. \"I saw that he\nwished to hear your name often. I reminded him of the times when you had\nbeen so young that most children of your age would have been in the\nhands of nurses, and yet you were strong and silent and sturdy and\ntraveled with us as if you were not a child at all--never crying when\nyou were tired and were not properly fed. As if you understood--as if\nyou understood,\" he added, proudly. \"If, through the power of God a\ncreature can be a man at six years old, you were that one. Many a dark\nday I have looked into your solemn, watching eyes, and have been half\nafraid; because that a child should answer one's gaze so gravely seemed\nalmost an unearthly thing.\"\n\n\"The chief thing I remember of those days,\" said Marco, \"is that he was\nwith me, and that whenever I was hungry or tired, I knew he must be,\ntoo.\"\n\nThe feeling that they were \"waiting\" was so intense that it filled the\ndays with strangeness. When the postman's knock was heard at the door,\neach of them endeavored not to start. A letter might some day come which\nwould tell them--they did not know what. But no letters came. When they\nwent out into the streets, they found themselves hurrying on their way\nback in spite of themselves. Something might have happened. Lazarus read\nthe papers faithfully, and in the evening told Marco and The Rat all the\nnews it was \"well that they should hear.\" But the disorders of Samavia\nhad ceased to occupy much space. They had become an old story, and after\nthe excitement of the assassination of Michael Maranovitch had died out,\nthere seemed to be a lull in events. Michael's son had not dared to try\nto take his father's place, and there were rumors that he also had been\nkilled. The head of the Iarovitch had declared himself king but had not\nbeen crowned because of disorders in his own party. The country seemed\nexisting in a nightmare of suffering, famine and suspense.\n\n\"Samavia is 'waiting' too,\" The Rat broke forth one night as they talked\ntogether, \"but it won't wait long--it can't. If I were a Samavian and in\nSamavia--\"\n\n\"My father is a Samavian and he is in Samavia,\" Marco's grave young\nvoice interposed.\n\nThe Rat flushed red as he realized what he had said. \"What a fool I am!\"\nhe groaned. \"I--I beg your pardon--sir.\" He stood up when he said the last\nwords and added the \"sir\" as if he suddenly realized that there was a\ndistance between them which was something akin to the distance between\nyouth and maturity--but yet was not the same.\n\n\"You are a good Samavian but--you forget,\" was Marco's answer.\n\nLazarus' intense grimness increased with each day that passed. The\nceremonious respectfulness of his manner toward Marco increased also. It\nseemed as if the more anxious he felt the more formal and stately his\nbearing became. It was as though he braced his own courage by doing the\nsmallest things life in the back sitting-room required as if they were\nof the dignity of services performed in a much larger place and under\nmuch more imposing circumstances. The Rat found himself feeling almost\nas if he were an equerry in a court, and that dignity and ceremony were\nnecessary on his own part. He began to experience a sense of being\nsomehow a person of rank, for whom doors were opened grandly and who had\nvassals at his command. The watchful obedience of fifty vassals embodied\nitself in the manner of Lazarus.\n\n\"I am glad,\" The Rat said once, reflectively, \"that, after all my father\nwas once--different. It makes it easier to learn things perhaps. If he\nhad not talked to me about people who--well, who had never seen places\nlike Bone Court--this might have been harder for me to understand.\"\n\nWhen at last they managed to call The Squad together, and went to spend\na morning at the Barracks behind the churchyard, that body of armed men\nstared at their commander in great and amazed uncertainty. They felt\nthat something had happened to him. They did not know what had happened,\nbut it was some experience which had made him mysteriously different. He\ndid not look like Marco, but in some extraordinary way he seemed more\nakin to him. They only knew that some necessity in Loristan's affairs\nhad taken the two away from London and the Game. Now they had come back,\nand they seemed older.\n\nAt first, The Squad felt awkward and shuffled its feet uncomfortably.\nAfter the first greetings it did not know exactly what to say. It was\nMarco who saved the situation.\n\n\"Drill us first,\" he said to The Rat, \"then we can talk about the Game.\"\n\n\"'Tention!\" shouted The Rat, magnificently. And then they forgot\neverything else and sprang into line. After the drill was ended, and\nthey sat in a circle on the broken flags, the Game became more\nresplendent than it had ever been.\n\n\"I've had time to read and work out new things,\" The Rat said. \"Reading\nis like traveling.\"\n\nMarco himself sat and listened, enthralled by the adroitness of the\nimagination he displayed. Without revealing a single dangerous fact he\nbuilt up, of their journeyings and experiences, a totally new structure\nof adventures which would have fired the whole being of any group of\nlads. It was safe to describe places and people, and he so described\nthem that The Squad squirmed in its delight at feeling itself marching\nin a procession attending the Emperor in Vienna; standing in line before\npalaces; climbing, with knapsacks strapped tight, up precipitous\nmountain roads; defending mountain-fortresses; and storming Samavian\ncastles.\n\nThe Squad glowed and exulted. The Rat glowed and exulted himself. Marco\nwatched his sharp-featured, burning-eyed face with wonder and\nadmiration. This strange power of making things alive was, he knew, what\nhis father would call \"genius.\"\n\n\"Let's take the oath of 'legiance again,\" shouted Cad, when the Game was\nover for the morning.\n\n\"The papers never said nothin' more about the Lost Prince, but we are\nall for him yet! Let's take it!\" So they stood in line again, Marco at\nthe head, and renewed their oath.\n\n\"The sword in my hand--for Samavia!\n\n\"The heart in my breast--for Samavia!\n\n\"The swiftness of my sight, the thought of my brain, the life of my\nlife--for Samavia.\n\n\"Here grow twelve men--for Samavia.\n\n\"God be thanked!\"\n\nIt was more solemn than it had been the first time. The Squad felt it\ntremendously. Both Cad and Ben were conscious that thrills ran down\ntheir spines into their boots. When Marco and The Rat left them, they\nfirst stood at salute and then broke out into a ringing cheer.\n\nOn their way home, The Rat asked Marco a question.\n\n\"Did you see Mrs. Beedle standing at the top of the basement steps and\nlooking after us when we went out this morning?\"\n\nMrs. Beedle was the landlady of the lodgings at No. 7 Philibert Place.\nShe was a mysterious and dusty female, who lived in the \"cellar kitchen\"\npart of the house and was seldom seen by her lodgers.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Marco, \"I have seen her two or three times lately, and I\ndo not think I ever saw her before. My father has never seen her, though\nLazarus says she used to watch him round corners. Why is she suddenly so\ncurious about us?\"\n\n\"I'd like to know,\" said The Rat. \"I've been trying to work it out. Ever\nsince we came back, she's been peeping round the door of the kitchen\nstairs, or over balustrades, or through the cellar-kitchen windows. I\nbelieve she wants to speak to you, and knows Lazarus won't let her if he\ncatches her at it. When Lazarus is about, she always darts back.\"\n\n\"What does she want to say?\" said Marco.\n\n\"I'd like to know,\" said The Rat again.\n\nWhen they reached No. 7 Philibert Place, they found out, because when\nthe door opened they saw at the top of cellar-kitchen stairs at the end\nof the passage, the mysterious Mrs. Beedle, in her dusty black dress and\nwith a dusty black cap on, evidently having that minute mounted from her\nsubterranean hiding-place. She had come up the steps so quickly that\nLazarus had not yet seen her.\n\n\"Young Master Loristan!\" she called out authoritatively. Lazarus wheeled\nabout fiercely.\n\n\"Silence!\" he commanded. \"How dare you address the young Master?\"\n\nShe snapped her fingers at him, and marched forward folding her arms\ntightly. \"You mind your own business,\" she said. \"It's young Master\nLoristan I'm speaking to, not his servant. It's time he was talked to\nabout this.\"\n\n\"Silence, woman!\" shouted Lazarus.\n\n\"Let her speak,\" said Marco. \"I want to hear. What is it you wish to\nsay, Madam? My father is not here.\"\n\n\"That's just what I want to find out about,\" put in the woman. \"When is\nhe coming back?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" answered Marco.\n\n\"That's it,\" said Mrs. Beedle. \"You're old enough to understand that two\nbig lads and a big fellow like that can't have food and lodgin's for\nnothing. You may say you don't live high--and you don't--but lodgin's\nare lodgin's and rent is rent. If your father's coming back and you can\ntell me when, I mayn't be obliged to let the rooms over your heads; but\nI know too much about foreigners to let bills run when they are out of\nsight. Your father's out of sight. He,\" jerking her head towards\nLazarus, \"paid me for last week. How do I know he will pay me for this\nweek!\"\n\n\"The money is ready,\" roared Lazarus.\n\nThe Rat longed to burst forth. He knew what people in Bone Court said to\na woman like that; he knew the exact words and phrases. But they were\nnot words and phrases an aide-de-camp might deliver himself of in the\npresence of his superior officer; they were not words and phrases an\nequerry uses at court. He dare not _allow_ himself to burst forth. He\nstood with flaming eyes and a flaming face, and bit his lips till they\nbled. He wanted to strike with his crutches. The son of Stefan Loristan!\nThe Bearer of the Sign! There sprang up before his furious eyes the\npicture of the luridly lighted cavern and the frenzied crowd of men\nkneeling at this same boy's feet, kissing them, kissing his hands, his\ngarments, the very earth he stood upon, worshipping him, while above the\naltar the kingly young face looked on with the nimbus of light like a\nhalo above it. If he dared speak his mind now, he felt he could have\nendured it better. But being an aide-de-camp he could not.\n\n\"Do you want the money now?\" asked Marco. \"It is only the beginning of\nthe week and we do not owe it to you until the week is over. Is it that\nyou want to have it now?\"\n\nLazarus had become deadly pale. He looked huge in his fury, and he\nlooked dangerous.\n\n\"Young Master,\" he said slowly, in a voice as deadly as his pallor, and\nhe actually spoke low, \"this woman--\"\n\nMrs. Beedle drew back towards the cellar-kitchen steps.\n\n\"There's police outside,\" she shrilled. \"Young Master Loristan, order\nhim to stand back.\"\n\n\"No one will hurt you,\" said Marco. \"If you have the money here,\nLazarus, please give it to me.\"\n\nLazarus literally ground his teeth. But he drew himself up and saluted\nwith ceremony. He put his hand in his breast pocket and produced an old\nleather wallet. There were but a few coins in it. He pointed to a gold\none.\n\n\"I obey you, sir--since I must--\" he said, breathing hard. \"That one\nwill pay her for the week.\"\n\nMarco took out the sovereign and held it out to the woman.\n\n\"You hear what he says,\" he said. \"At the end of this week if there is\nnot enough to pay for the next, we will go.\"\n\nLazarus looked so like a hyena, only held back from springing by chains\nof steel, that the dusty Mrs. Beedle was afraid to take the money.\n\n\"If you say that I shall not lose it, I'll wait until the week's ended,\"\nshe said. \"You're nothing but a lad, but you're like your father. You've\ngot a way that a body can trust. If he was here and said he hadn't the\nmoney but he'd have it in time, I'd wait if it was for a month. He'd pay\nit if he said he would. But he's gone; and two boys and a fellow like\nthat one don't seem much to depend on. But I'll trust _you_.\"\n\n\"Be good enough to take it,\" said Marco. And he put the coin in her hand\nand turned into the back sitting-room as if he did not see her.\n\nThe Rat and Lazarus followed him.\n\n\"Is there so little money left?\" said Marco. \"We have always had very\nlittle. When we had less than usual, we lived in poorer places and were\nhungry if it was necessary. We know how to go hungry. One does not die\nof it.\"\n\nThe big eyes under Lazarus' beetling brows filled with tears.\n\n\"No, sir,\" he said, \"one does not die of hunger. But the insult--the\ninsult! That is not endurable.\"\n\n\"She would not have spoken if my father had been here,\" Marco said. \"And\nit is true that boys like us have no money. Is there enough to pay for\nanother week?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Lazarus, swallowing hard as if he had a lump in his\nthroat, \"perhaps enough for two--if we eat but little. If--if the Master\nwould accept money from those who would give it, he would always have had\nenough. But how could such a one as he? How could he? When he went away,\nhe thought--he thought that--\" but there he stopped himself suddenly.\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Marco. \"Never mind. We will go away the day we can\npay no more.\"\n\n\"I can go out and sell newspapers,\" said The Rat's sharp voice.\n\n\"I've done it before. Crutches help you to sell them. The platform would\nsell 'em faster still. I'll go out on the platform.\"\n\n\"I can sell newspapers, too,\" said Marco.\n\nLazarus uttered an exclamation like a groan.\n\n\"Sir,\" he cried, \"no, no! Am I not here to go out and look for work? I\ncan carry loads. I can run errands.\"\n\n\"We will all three begin to see what we can do,\" Marco said.\n\nThen--exactly as had happened on the day of their return from their\njourney--there arose in the road outside the sound of newsboys shouting.\nThis time the outcry seemed even more excited than before. The boys were\nrunning and yelling and there seemed more of them than usual. And above\nall other words was heard \"Samavia! Samavia!\" But to-day The Rat did not\nrush to the door at the first cry. He stood still--for several seconds\nthey all three stood still--listening. Afterwards each one remembered\nand told the others that he had stood still because some strange, strong\nfeeling held him _waiting_ as if to hear some great thing.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\t   \nIt was Lazarus who went out of the room first and The Rat and Marco\nfollowed him.\n\nOne of the upstairs lodgers had run down in haste and opened the door to\nbuy newspapers and ask questions. The newsboys were wild with excitement\nand danced about as they shouted. The piece of news they were yelling\nhad evidently a popular quality.\n\nThe lodger bought two papers and was handing out coppers to a lad who\nwas talking loud and fast.\n\n\"Here's a go!\" he was saying. \"A Secret Party's risen up and taken\nSamavia! 'Twixt night and mornin' they done it! That there Lost Prince\ndescendant 'as turned up, an' they've _crowned_ him--'twixt night and\nmornin' they done it! Clapt 'is crown on 'is 'ead, so's they'd lose no\ntime.\" And off he bolted, shouting, \"'Cendant of Lost Prince! 'Cendant\nof Lost Prince made King of Samavia!\"\n\nIt was then that Lazarus, forgetting even ceremony, bolted also. He\nbolted back to the sitting-room, rushed in, and the door fell to behind\nhim.\n\nMarco and The Rat found it shut when, having secured a newspaper, they\nwent down the passage. At the closed door, Marco stopped. He did not\nturn the handle. From the inside of the room there came the sound of big\nconvulsive sobs and passionate Samavian words of prayer and worshipping\ngratitude.\n\n\"Let us wait,\" Marco said, trembling a little. \"He will not want any one\nto see him. Let us wait.\"\n\nHis black pits of eyes looked immense, and he stood at his tallest, but\nhe was trembling slightly from head to foot. The Rat had begun to shake,\nas if from an ague. His face was scarcely human in its fierce unboyish\nemotion.\n\n\"Marco! Marco!\" his whisper was a cry. \"That was what he went\nfor--_because he knew_!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Marco, \"that was what he went for.\" And his voice was\nunsteady, as his body was.\n\nPresently the sobs inside the room choked themselves back suddenly.\nLazarus had remembered. They had guessed he had been leaning against the\nwall during his outburst. Now it was evident that he stood upright,\nprobably shocked at the forgetfulness of his frenzy.\n\nSo Marco turned the handle of the door and went into the room. He shut\nthe door behind him, and they all three stood together.\n\nWhen the Samavian gives way to his emotions, he is emotional indeed.\nLazarus looked as if a storm had swept over him. He had choked back his\nsobs, but tears still swept down his cheeks.\n\n\"Sir,\" he said hoarsely, \"your pardon! It was as if a convulsion seized\nme. I forgot everything--even my duty. Pardon, pardon!\" And there on the\nworn carpet of the dingy back sitting-room in the Marylebone Road, he\nactually went on one knee and kissed the boy's hand with adoration.\n\n\"You mustn't ask pardon,\" said Marco. \"You have waited so long, good\nfriend. You have given your life as my father has. You have known all\nthe suffering a boy has not lived long enough to understand. Your big\nheart--your faithful heart--\" his voice broke and he stood and looked at\nhim with an appeal which seemed to ask him to remember his boyhood and\nunderstand the rest.\n\n\"Don't kneel,\" he said next. \"You mustn't kneel.\" And Lazarus, kissing\nhis hand again, rose to his feet.\n\n\"Now--we shall _hear_!\" said Marco. \"Now the waiting will soon be over.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Now, we shall receive commands!\" Lazarus answered.\n\nThe Rat held out the newspapers.\n\n\"May we read them yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"Until further orders, sir,\" said Lazarus hurriedly and apologetically\n--\"until further orders, it is still better that I should read them\nfirst.\"\n\n\n\n\nXXX\n\nTHE GAME IS AT AN END\n\n\nSo long as the history of Europe is written and read, the unparalleled\nstory of the Rising of the Secret Party in Samavia will stand out as one\nof its most startling and romantic records. Every detail connected with\nthe astonishing episode, from beginning to end, was romantic even when\nit was most productive of realistic results. When it is related, it\nalways begins with the story of the tall and kingly Samavian youth who\nwalked out of the palace in the early morning sunshine singing the\nherdsmen's song of beauty of old days. Then comes the outbreak of the\nruined and revolting populace; then the legend of the morning on the\nmountain side, and the old shepherd coming out of his cave and finding\nthe apparently dead body of the beautiful young hunter. Then the secret\nnursing in the cavern; then the jolting cart piled with sheepskins\ncrossing the frontier, and ending its journey at the barred entrance of\nthe monastery and leaving its mysterious burden behind. And then the\nbitter hate and struggle of dynasties, and the handful of shepherds and\nherdsmen meeting in their cavern and binding themselves and their unborn\nsons and sons' sons by an oath never to be broken. Then the passing of\ngenerations and the slaughter of peoples and the changing of kings,--and\nalways that oath remembered, and the Forgers of the Sword, at their\nsecret work, hidden in forests and caves. Then the strange story of the\nuncrowned kings who, wandering in other lands, lived and died in silence\nand seclusion, often laboring with their hands for their daily bread,\nbut never forgetting that they must be kings, and ready,--even though\nSamavia never called. Perhaps the whole story would fill too many\nvolumes to admit of it ever being told fully.\n\nBut history makes the growing of the Secret Party clear,--though it\nseems almost to cease to be history, in spite of its efforts to be brief\nand speak only of dull facts, when it is forced to deal with the Bearing\nof the Sign by two mere boys, who, being blown as unremarked as any two\ngrains of dust across Europe, lit the Lamp whose flame so flared up to\nthe high heavens that as if from the earth itself there sprang forth\nSamavians by the thousands ready to feed it--Iarovitch and Maranovitch\nswept aside forever and only Samavians remaining to cry aloud in ardent\npraise and worship of the God who had brought back to them their Lost\nPrince. The battle-cry of his name had ended every battle. Swords fell\nfrom hands because swords were not needed. The Iarovitch fled in terror\nand dismay; the Maranovitch were nowhere to be found. Between night and\nmorning, as the newsboy had said, the standard of Ivor was raised and\nwaved from palace and citadel alike. From mountain, forest and plain,\nfrom city, village and town, its followers flocked to swear allegiance;\nbroken and wounded legions staggered along the roads to join and kneel\nto it; women and children followed, weeping with joy and chanting songs\nof praise. The Powers held out their scepters to the lately prostrate\nand ignored country. Train-loads of food and supplies of all things\nneeded began to cross the frontier; the aid of nations was bestowed.\nSamavia, at peace to till its land, to raise its flocks, to mine its\nores, would be able to pay all back. Samavia in past centuries had been\nrich enough to make great loans, and had stored such harvests as warring\ncountries had been glad to call upon. The story of the crowning of the\nKing had been the wildest of all--the multitude of ecstatic people,\nfamished, in rags, and many of them weak with wounds, kneeling at his\nfeet, praying, as their one salvation and security, that he would go\nattended by them to their bombarded and broken cathedral, and at its\nhigh altar let the crown be placed upon his head, so that even those who\nperhaps must die of their past sufferings would at least have paid their\npoor homage to the King Ivor who would rule their children and bring\nback to Samavia her honor and her peace.\n\n\"Ivor! Ivor!\" they chanted like a prayer,--\"Ivor! Ivor!\" in their\nhouses, by the roadside, in the streets.\n\n\"The story of the Coronation in the shattered Cathedral, whose roof had\nbeen torn to fragments by bombs,\" said an important London paper, \"reads\nlike a legend of the Middle Ages. But, upon the whole, there is in\nSamavia's national character, something of the mediaeval, still.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLazarus, having bought and read in his top floor room every newspaper\nrecording the details which had reached London, returned to report\nalmost verbatim, standing erect before Marco, the eyes under his shaggy\nbrows sometimes flaming with exultation, sometimes filled with a rush of\ntears. He could not be made to sit down. His whole big body seemed to\nhave become rigid with magnificence. Meeting Mrs. Beedle in the passage,\nhe strode by her with an air so thunderous that she turned and scuttled\nback to her cellar kitchen, almost falling down the stone steps in her\nnervous terror. In such a mood, he was not a person to face without\nsomething like awe.\n\nIn the middle of the night, The Rat suddenly spoke to Marco as if he\nknew that he was awake and would hear him.\n\n\"He has given all his life to Samavia!\" he said. \"When you traveled from\ncountry to country, and lived in holes and corners, it was because by\ndoing it he could escape spies, and see the people who must be made to\nunderstand. No one else could have made them listen. An emperor would\nhave begun to listen when he had seen his face and heard his voice. And\nhe could be silent, and wait for the right time to speak. He could keep\nstill when other men could not. He could keep his face still--and his\nhands--and his eyes. Now all Samavia knows what he has done, and that he\nhas been the greatest patriot in the world. We both saw what Samavians\nwere like that night in the cavern. They will go mad with joy when they\nsee his face!\"\n\n\"They have seen it now,\" said Marco, in a low voice from his bed.\n\nThen there was a long silence, though it was not quite silence because\nThe Rat's breathing was so quick and hard.\n\n\"He--must have been at that coronation!\" he said at last. \"The\nKing--what will the King do to--repay him?\"\n\nMarco did not answer. His breathing could be heard also. His mind was\npicturing that same coronation--the shattered, roofless cathedral, the\nruins of the ancient and magnificent high altar, the multitude of\nkneeling, famine-scourged people, the battle-worn, wounded and bandaged\nsoldiery! And the King! And his father! Where had his father stood when\nthe King was crowned? Surely, he had stood at the King's right hand, and\nthe people had adored and acclaimed them equally!\n\n\"King Ivor!\" he murmured as if he were in a dream. \"King Ivor!\"\n\nThe Rat started up on his elbow.\n\n\"You will see him,\" he cried out. \"He's not a dream any longer. The Game\nis not a game now--and it is ended--it is won! It was real--_he_ was real!\nMarco, I don't believe you hear.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do,\" answered Marco, \"but it is almost more a dream than when it\nwas one.\"\n\n\"The greatest patriot in the world is like a king himself!\" raved The\nRat. \"If there is no bigger honor to give him, he will be made a\nprince--and Commander-in-Chief--and Prime Minister! Can't you hear those\nSamavians shouting, and singing, and praying? You'll see it all! Do you\nremember the mountain climber who was going to save the shoes he made\nfor the Bearer of the Sign? He said a great day might come when one\ncould show them to the people. It's come! He'll show them! I know how\nthey'll take it!\" His voice suddenly dropped--as if it dropped into a\npit. \"You'll see it all. But I shall not.\"\n\nThen Marco awoke from his dream and lifted his head. \"Why not?\" he\ndemanded. It sounded like a demand.\n\n\"Because I know better than to expect it!\" The Rat groaned. \"You've\ntaken me a long way, but you can't take me to the palace of a king. I'm\nnot such a fool as to think that, even if your father--\"\n\nHe broke off because Marco did more than lift his head. He sat upright.\n\n\"You bore the Sign as much as I did,\" he said. \"We bore it together.\"\n\n\"Who would have listened to _me_?\" cried The Rat. \"_You_ were the son of\nStefan Loristan.\"\n\n\"You were the friend of his son,\" answered Marco. \"You went at the\ncommand of Stefan Loristan. You were the _army_ of the son of Stefan\nLoristan. That I have told you. Where I go, you will go. We will say no\nmore of this--not one word.\"\n\nAnd he lay down again in the silence of a prince of the blood. And The\nRat knew that he meant what he said, and that Stefan Loristan also would\nmean it. And because he was a boy, he began to wonder what Mrs. Beedle\nwould do when she heard what had happened--what had been happening all\nthe time a tall, shabby \"foreigner\" had lived in her dingy back\nsitting-room, and been closely watched lest he should go away without\npaying his rent, as shabby foreigners sometimes did. The Rat saw himself\nmanaging to poise himself very erect on his crutches while he told her\nthat the shabby foreigner was--well, was at least the friend of a King,\nand had given him his crown--and would be made a prince and a\nCommander-in-Chief--and a Prime Minister--because there was no higher\nrank or honor to give him. And his son--whom she had insulted--was\nSamavia's idol because he had borne the Sign. And also that if she were\nin Samavia, and Marco chose to do it he could batter her wretched\nlodging-house to the ground and put her in a prison--\"and serve her\njolly well right!\"\n\nThe next day passed, and the next; and then there came a letter. It was\nfrom Loristan, and Marco turned pale when Lazarus handed it to him.\nLazarus and The Rat went out of the room at once, and left him to read\nit alone. It was evidently not a long letter, because it was not many\nminutes before Marco called them again into the room.\n\n\"In a few days, messengers--friends of my father's--will come to take us\nto Samavia. You and I and Lazarus are to go,\" he said to The Rat.\n\n\"God be thanked!\" said Lazarus. \"God be thanked!\"\n\nBefore the messengers came, it was the end of the week. Lazarus had\npacked their few belongings, and on Saturday Mrs. Beedle was to be seen\nhovering at the top of the cellar steps, when Marco and The Rat left the\nback sitting-room to go out.\n\n\"You needn't glare at me!\" she said to Lazarus, who stood glowering at\nthe door which he had opened for them. \"Young Master Loristan, I want to\nknow if you've heard when your father is coming back?\"\n\n\"He will not come back,\" said Marco.\n\n\"He won't, won't he? Well, how about next week's rent?\" said Mrs.\nBeedle. \"Your man's been packing up, I notice. He's not got much to\ncarry away, but it won't pass through that front door until I've got\nwhat's owing me. People that can pack easy think they can get away easy,\nand they'll bear watching. The week's up to-day.\"\n\nLazarus wheeled and faced her with a furious gesture. \"Get back to your\ncellar, woman,\" he commanded. \"Get back under ground and stay there.\nLook at what is stopping before your miserable gate.\"\n\nA carriage was stopping--a very perfect carriage of dark brown. The\ncoachman and footman wore dark brown and gold liveries, and the footman\nhad leaped down and opened the door with respectful alacrity. \"They are\nfriends of the Master's come to pay their respects to his son,\" said\nLazarus. \"Are their eyes to be offended by the sight of you?\"\n\n\"Your money is safe,\" said Marco. \"You had better leave us.\"\n\nMrs. Beedle gave a sharp glance at the two gentlemen who had entered the\nbroken gate. They were of an order which did not belong to Philibert\nPlace. They looked as if the carriage and the dark brown and gold\nliveries were every-day affairs to them.\n\n\"At all events, they're two grown men, and not two boys without a\npenny,\" she said. \"If they're your father's friends, they'll tell me\nwhether my rent's safe or not.\"\n\nThe two visitors were upon the threshold. They were both men of a\ncertain self-contained dignity of type; and when Lazarus opened wide the\ndoor, they stepped into the shabby entrance hall as if they did not see\nit. They looked past its dinginess, and past Lazarus, and The Rat, and\nMrs. Beedle--_through_ them, as it were,--at Marco.\n\nHe advanced towards them at once.\n\n\"You come from my father!\" he said, and gave his hand first to the elder\nman, then to the younger.\n\n\"Yes, we come from your father. I am Baron Rastka--and this is the Count\nVorversk,\" said the elder man, bowing.\n\n\"If they're barons and counts, and friends of your father's, they are\nwell-to-do enough to be responsible for you,\" said Mrs. Beedle, rather\nfiercely, because she was somewhat over-awed and resented the fact.\n\"It's a matter of next week's rent, gentlemen. I want to know where it's\ncoming from.\"\n\nThe elder man looked at her with a swift cold glance. He did not speak\nto her, but to Lazarus. \"What is she doing here?\" he demanded.\n\nMarco answered him. \"She is afraid we cannot pay our rent,\" he said. \"It\nis of great importance to her that she should be sure.\"\n\n\"Take her away,\" said the gentleman to Lazarus. He did not even glance\nat her. He drew something from his coat-pocket and handed it to the old\nsoldier. \"Take her away,\" he repeated. And because it seemed as if she\nwere not any longer a person at all, Mrs. Beedle actually shuffled down\nthe passage to the cellar-kitchen steps. Lazarus did not leave her until\nhe, too, had descended into the cellar kitchen, where he stood and\ntowered above her like an infuriated giant.\n\n\"To-morrow he will be on his way to Samavia, miserable woman!\" he said.\n\"Before he goes, it would be well for you to implore his pardon.\"\n\nBut Mrs. Beedle's point of view was not his. She had recovered some of\nher breath.\n\n\"I don't know where Samavia is,\" she raged, as she struggled to set her\ndusty, black cap straight. \"I'll warrant it's one of these little\nforeign countries you can scarcely see on the map--and not a decent\nEnglish town in it! He can go as soon as he likes, so long as he pays\nhis rent before he does it. Samavia, indeed! You talk as if he was\nBuckingham Palace!\"\n\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\n\"THE SON OF STEFAN LORISTAN\"\n\n\nWhen a party composed of two boys attended by a big soldierly\nman-servant and accompanied by two distinguished-looking, elderly men,\nof a marked foreign type, appeared on the platform of Charing Cross\nStation they attracted a good deal of attention. In fact, the good looks\nand strong, well-carried body of the handsome lad with the thick black\nhair would have caused eyes to turn towards him even if he had not\nseemed to be regarded as so special a charge by those who were with him.\nBut in a country where people are accustomed to seeing a certain manner\nand certain forms observed in the case of persons--however young--who\nare set apart by the fortune of rank and distinction, and where the\npopulace also rather enjoys the sight of such demeanor, it was\ninevitable that more than one quick-sighted looker-on should comment on\nthe fact that this was not an ordinary group of individuals.\n\n\"See that fine, big lad over there!\" said a workman, whose head, with a\npipe in its mouth, stuck out of a third-class smoking carriage window.\n\"He's some sort of a young swell, I'll lay a shillin'! Take a look at\nhim,\" to his mate inside.\n\nThe mate took a look. The pair were of the decent, polytechnic-educated\ntype, and were shrewd at observation.\n\n\"Yes, he's some sort of young swell,\" he summed him up. \"But he's not\nEnglish by a long chalk. He must be a young Turk, or Russian, sent over\nto be educated. His suite looks like it. All but the ferret-faced chap\non crutches. Wonder what he is!\"\n\nA good-natured looking guard was passing, and the first man hailed him.\n\n\"Have we got any swells traveling with us this morning?\" he asked,\njerking his head towards the group. \"That looks like it. Any one leaving\nWindsor or Sandringham to cross from Dover to-day?\"\n\nThe man looked at the group curiously for a moment and then shook his\nhead.\n\n\"They do look like something or other,\" he answered, \"but no one knows\nanything about them. Everybody's safe in Buckingham Palace and\nMarlborough House this week. No one either going or coming.\"\n\nNo observer, it is true, could have mistaken Lazarus for an ordinary\nattendant escorting an ordinary charge. If silence had not still been\nstrictly the order, he could not have restrained himself. As it was, he\nbore himself like a grenadier, and stood by Marco as if across his dead\nbody alone could any one approach the lad.\n\n\"Until we reach Melzarr,\" he had said with passion to the two\ngentlemen,--\"until I can stand before my Master and behold him embrace\nhis son--_behold_ him--I implore that I may not lose sight of him night or\nday. On my knees, I implore that I may travel, armed, at his side. I am\nbut his servant, and have no right to occupy a place in the same\ncarriage. But put me anywhere. I will be deaf, dumb, blind to all but\nhimself. Only permit me to be near enough to give my life if it is\nneeded. Let me say to my Master, 'I never left him.'\"\n\n\"We will find a place for you,\" the elder man said, \"and if you are so\nanxious, you may sleep across his threshold when we spend the night at a\nhotel.\"\n\n\"I will not sleep!\" said Lazarus. \"I will watch. Suppose there should be\ndemons of Maranovitch loose and infuriated in Europe? Who knows!\"\n\n\"The Maranovitch and Iarovitch who have not already sworn allegiance to\nKing Ivor are dead on battlefields. The remainder are now Fedorovitch\nand praising God for their King,\" was the answer Baron Rastka made him.\n\nBut Lazarus kept his guard unbroken. When he occupied the next\ncompartment to the one in which Marco traveled, he stood in the corridor\nthroughout the journey. When they descended at any point to change\ntrains, he followed close at the boy's heels, his fierce eyes on every\nside at once and his hand on the weapon hidden in his broad leather\nbelt. When they stopped to rest in some city, he planted himself in a\nchair by the bedroom door of his charge, and if he slept he was not\naware that nature had betrayed him into doing so.\n\nIf the journey made by the young Bearers of the Sign had been a strange\none, this was strange by its very contrast. Throughout that pilgrimage,\ntwo uncared-for waifs in worn clothes had traveled from one place to\nanother, sometimes in third- or fourth-class continental railroad\ncarriages, sometimes in jolting diligences, sometimes in peasants'\ncarts, sometimes on foot by side roads and mountain paths, and forest\nways. Now, two well-dressed boys in the charge of two men of the class\nwhose orders are obeyed, journeyed in compartments reserved for them,\ntheir traveling appurtenances supplying every comfort that luxury could\nprovide.\n\nThe Rat had not known that there were people who traveled in such a\nmanner; that wants could be so perfectly foreseen; that railroad\nofficials, porters at stations, the staff of restaurants, could be by\nmagic transformed into active and eager servants. To lean against the\nupholstered back of a railway carriage and in luxurious ease look\nthrough the window at passing beauties, and then to find books at your\nelbow and excellent meals appearing at regular hours, these unknown\nperfections made it necessary for him at times to pull himself together\nand give all his energies to believing that he was quite awake. Awake he\nwas, and with much on his mind \"to work out,\"--so much, indeed, that on\nthe first day of the journey he had decided to give up the struggle, and\nwait until fate made clear to him such things as he was to be allowed to\nunderstand of the mystery of Stefan Loristan.\n\nWhat he realized most clearly was that the fact that the son of Stefan\nLoristan was being escorted in private state to the country his father\nhad given his life's work to, was never for a moment forgotten. The\nBaron Rastka and Count Vorversk were of the dignity and courteous\nreserve which marks men of distinction. Marco was not a mere boy to\nthem, he was the son of Stefan Loristan; and they were Samavians. They\nwatched over him, not as Lazarus did, but with a gravity and forethought\nwhich somehow seemed to encircle him with a rampart. Without any air of\nsubservience, they constituted themselves his attendants. His comfort,\nhis pleasure, even his entertainment, were their private care. The Rat\nfelt sure they intended that, if possible, he should enjoy his journey,\nand that he should not be fatigued by it. They conversed with him as The\nRat had not known that men ever conversed with boys,--until he had met\nLoristan. It was plain that they knew what he would be most interested\nin, and that they were aware he was as familiar with the history of\nSamavia as they were themselves. When he showed a disposition to hear of\nevents which had occurred, they were as prompt to follow his lead as\nthey would have been to follow the lead of a man. That, The Rat argued\nwith himself, was because Marco had lived so intimately with his father\nthat his life had been more like a man's than a boy's and had trained\nhim in mature thinking. He was very quiet during the journey, and The\nRat knew he was thinking all the time.\n\nThe night before they reached Melzarr, they slept at a town some hours\ndistant from the capital. They arrived at midnight and went to a quiet\nhotel.\n\n\"To-morrow,\" said Marco, when The Rat had left him for the night,\n\"to-morrow, we shall see him! God be thanked!\"\n\n\"God be thanked!\" said The Rat, also. And each saluted the other before\nthey parted.\n\nIn the morning, Lazarus came into the bedroom with an air so solemn that\nit seemed as if the garments he carried in his hands were part of some\nreligious ceremony.\n\n\"I am at your command, sir,\" he said. \"And I bring you your uniform.\"\n\nHe carried, in fact, a richly decorated Samavian uniform, and the first\nthing Marco had seen when he entered was that Lazarus himself was in\nuniform also. His was the uniform of an officer of the King's Body\nGuard.\n\n\"The Master,\" he said, \"asks that you wear this on your entrance to\nMelzarr. I have a uniform, also, for your aide-de-camp.\"\n\nWhen Rastka and Vorversk appeared, they were in uniforms also. It was a\nuniform which had a touch of the Orient in its picturesque splendor. A\nshort fur-bordered mantle hung by a jeweled chain from the shoulders,\nand there was much magnificent embroidery of color and gold.\n\n\"Sir, we must drive quickly to the station,\" Baron Rastka said to Marco.\n\"These people are excitable and patriotic, and His Majesty wishes us to\nremain incognito, and avoid all chance of public demonstration until we\nreach the capital.\" They passed rather hurriedly through the hotel to\nthe carriage which awaited them. The Rat saw that something unusual was\nhappening in the place. Servants were scurrying round corners, and\nguests were coming out of their rooms and even hanging over the\nbalustrades.\n\nAs Marco got into his carriage, he caught sight of a boy about his own\nage who was peeping from behind a bush. Suddenly he darted away, and\nthey all saw him tearing down the street towards the station as fast as\nhis legs would carry him.\n\nBut the horses were faster than he was. The party reached the station,\nand was escorted quickly to its place in a special saloon-carriage\nwhich awaited it. As the train made its way out of the station, Marco\nsaw the boy who had run before them rush on to the platform, waving his\narms and shouting something with wild delight. The people who were\nstanding about turned to look at him, and the next instant they had all\ntorn off their caps and thrown them up in the air and were shouting\nalso. But it was not possible to hear what they said.\n\n\"We were only just in time,\" said Vorversk, and Baron Rastka nodded.\n\nThe train went swiftly, and stopped only once before they reached\nMelzarr. This was at a small station, on the platform of which stood\npeasants with big baskets of garlanded flowers and evergreens. They put\nthem on the train, and soon both Marco and The Rat saw that something\nunusual was taking place. At one time, a man standing on the narrow\noutside platform of the carriage was plainly seen to be securing\ngarlands and handing up flags to men who worked on the roof.\n\n\"They are doing something with Samavian flags and a lot of flowers and\ngreen things!\" cried The Rat, in excitement.\n\n\"Sir, they are decorating the outside of the carriage,\" Vorversk said.\n\"The villagers on the line obtained permission from His Majesty. The son\nof Stefan Loristan could not be allowed to pass their homes without\ntheir doing homage.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Marco, his heart thumping hard against his uniform.\n\"It is for my father's sake.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt last, embowered, garlanded, and hung with waving banners, the train\ndrew in at the chief station at Melzarr.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Rastka, as they were entering, \"will you stand up that the\npeople may see you? Those on the outskirts of the crowd will have the\nmerest glimpse, but they will never forget.\"\n\nMarco stood up. The others grouped themselves behind him. There arose a\nroar of voices, which ended almost in a shriek of joy which was like the\nshriek of a tempest. Then there burst forth the blare of brazen\ninstruments playing the National Hymn of Samavia, and mad voices joined\nin it.\n\nIf Marco had not been a strong boy, and long trained in self-control,\nwhat he saw and heard might have been almost too much to be borne. When\nthe train had come to a full stop, and the door was thrown open, even\nRastka's dignified voice was unsteady as he said, \"Sir, lead the way. It\nis for us to follow.\"\n\nAnd Marco, erect in the doorway, stood for a moment, looking out upon\nthe roaring, acclaiming, weeping, singing and swaying multitude--and\nsaluted just as he had saluted The Squad, looking just as much a boy,\njust as much a man, just as much a thrilling young human being.\n\nThen, at the sight of him standing so, it seemed as if the crowd went\nmad--as the Forgers of the Sword had seemed to go mad on the night in\nthe cavern. The tumult rose and rose, the crowd rocked, and leapt, and,\nin its frenzy of emotion, threatened to crush itself to death. But for\nthe lines of soldiers, there would have seemed no chance for any one to\npass through it alive.\n\n\"I am the son of Stefan Loristan,\" Marco said to himself, in order to\nhold himself steady. \"I am on my way to my father.\"\n\nAfterward, he was moving through the line of guarding soldiers to the\nentrance, where two great state-carriages stood; and there, outside,\nwaited even a huger and more frenzied crowd than that left behind. He\nsaluted there again, and again, and again, on all sides. It was what\nthey had seen the Emperor do in Vienna. He was not an Emperor, but he\nwas the son of Stefan Loristan who had brought back the King.\n\n\"You must salute, too,\" he said to The Rat, when they got into the state\ncarriage. \"Perhaps my father has told them. It seems as if they knew\nyou.\"\n\nThe Rat had been placed beside him on the carriage seat. He was inwardly\nshuddering with a rapture of exultation which was almost anguish. The\npeople were looking at him--shouting at him--surely it seemed like it\nwhen he looked at the faces nearest in the crowd. Perhaps Loristan--\n\n\"Listen!\" said Marco suddenly, as the carriage rolled on its way. \"They\nare shouting to us in Samavian, 'The Bearers of the Sign!' That is what\nthey are saying now. 'The Bearers of the Sign.'\"\n\nThey were being taken to the Palace. That Baron Rastka and Count\nVorversk had explained in the train. His Majesty wished to receive them.\nStefan Loristan was there also.\n\nThe city had once been noble and majestic. It was somewhat Oriental, as\nits uniforms and national costumes were. There were domed and pillared\nstructures of white stone and marble, there were great arches, and city\ngates, and churches. But many of them were half in ruins through war,\nand neglect, and decay. They passed the half-unroofed cathedral,\nstanding in the sunshine in its great square, still in all its disaster\none of the most beautiful structures in Europe. In the exultant crowd\nwere still to be seen haggard faces, men with bandaged limbs and heads\nor hobbling on sticks and crutches. The richly colored native costumes\nwere most of them worn to rags. But their wearers had the faces of\ncreatures plucked from despair to be lifted to heaven.\n\n\"Ivor! Ivor!\" they cried; \"Ivor! Ivor!\" and sobbed with rapture.\n\nThe Palace was as wonderful in its way as the white cathedral. The\nimmensely wide steps of marble were guarded by soldiers. The huge square\nin which it stood was filled with people whom the soldiers held in\ncheck.\n\n\"I am his son,\" Marco said to himself, as he descended from the state\ncarriage and began to walk up the steps which seemed so enormously wide\nthat they appeared almost like a street. Up he mounted, step by step,\nThe Rat following him. And as he turned from side to side, to salute\nthose who made deep obeisance as he passed, he began to realize that he\nhad seen their faces before.\n\n\"These who are guarding the steps,\" he said, quickly under his breath to\nThe Rat, \"are the Forgers of the Sword!\"\n\nThere were rich uniforms everywhere when he entered the palace, and\npeople who bowed almost to the ground as he passed. He was very young to\nbe confronted with such an adoring adulation and royal ceremony; but he\nhoped it would not last too long, and that after he had knelt to the\nKing and kissed his hand, he would see his father and hear his voice.\nJust to hear his voice again, and feel his hand on his shoulder!\n\nThrough the vaulted corridors, to the wide-opened doors of a magnificent\nroom he was led at last. The end of it seemed a long way off as he\nentered. There were many richly dressed people who stood in line as he\npassed up toward the canopied dais. He felt that he had grown pale with\nthe strain of excitement, and he had begun to feel that he must be\nwalking in a dream, as on each side people bowed low and curtsied to the\nground.\n\nHe realized vaguely that the King himself was standing, awaiting his\napproach. But as he advanced, each step bearing him nearer to the\nthrone, the light and color about him, the strangeness and magnificence,\nthe wildly joyous acclamation of the populace outside the palace, made\nhim feel rather dazzled, and he did not clearly see any one single face\nor thing.\n\n\"His Majesty awaits you,\" said a voice behind him which seemed to be\nBaron Rastka's. \"Are you faint, sir? You look pale.\"\n\nHe drew himself together, and lifted his eyes. For one full moment,\nafter he had so lifted them, he stood quite still and straight, looking\ninto the deep beauty of the royal face. Then he knelt and kissed the\nhands held out to him--kissed them both with a passion of boy love and\nworship.\n\nThe King had the eyes he had longed to see--the King's hands were those\nhe had longed to feel again upon his shoulder--the King was his father!\nthe \"Stefan Loristan\" who had been the last of those who had waited and\nlabored for Samavia through five hundred years, and who had lived and\ndied kings, though none of them till now had worn a crown!\n\nHis father was the King!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was not that night, nor the next, nor for many nights that the\ntelling of the story was completed. The people knew that their King and\nhis son were rarely separated from each other; that the Prince's suite\nof apartments were connected by a private passage with his father's. The\ntwo were bound together by an affection of singular strength and\nmeaning, and their love for their people added to their feeling for each\nother. In the history of what their past had been, there was a romance\nwhich swelled the emotional Samavian heart near to bursting. By mountain\nfires, in huts, under the stars, in fields and in forests, all that was\nknown of their story was told and retold a thousand times, with sobs of\njoy and prayer breaking in upon the tale.\n\nBut none knew it as it was told in a certain quiet but stately room in\nthe palace, where the man once known only as \"Stefan Loristan,\" but whom\nhistory would call the first King Ivor of Samavia, told his share of it\nto the boy whom Samavians had a strange and superstitious worship for,\nbecause he seemed so surely their Lost Prince restored in body and\nsoul--almost the kingly lad in the ancient portrait--some of them half\nbelieved when he stood in the sunshine, with the halo about his head.\n\nIt was a wonderful and intense story, that of the long wanderings and\nthe close hiding of the dangerous secret. Among all those who had known\nthat a man who was an impassioned patriot was laboring for Samavia, and\nusing all the power of a great mind and the delicate ingenuity of a\ngreat genius to gain friends and favor for his unhappy country, there\nhad been but one who had known that Stefan Loristan had a claim to the\nSamavian throne. He had made no claim, he had sought--not a crown--but\nthe final freedom of the nation for which his love had been a religion.\n\n\"Not the crown!\" he said to the two young Bearers of the Sign as they\nsat at his feet like schoolboys--\"not a throne. 'The Life of my\nlife--for Samavia.' That was what I worked for--what we have all worked\nfor. If there had risen a wiser man in Samavia's time of need, it would\nnot have been for me to remind them of their Lost Prince. I could have\nstood aside. But no man arose. The crucial moment came--and the one man\nwho knew the secret, revealed it. Then--Samavia called, and I answered.\"\n\nHe put his hand on the thick, black hair of his boy's head.\n\n\"There was a thing we never spoke of together,\" he said. \"I believed\nalways that your mother died of her bitter fears for me and the unending\nstrain of them. She was very young and loving, and knew that there was\nno day when we parted that we were sure of seeing each other alive\nagain. When she died, she begged me to promise that your boyhood and\nyouth should not be burdened by the knowledge she had found it so\nterrible to bear. I should have kept the secret from you, even if she\nhad not so implored me. I had never meant that you should know the truth\nuntil you were a man. If I had died, a certain document would have been\nsent to you which would have left my task in your hands and made my\nplans clear. You would have known then that you also were a Prince Ivor,\nwho must take up his country's burden and be ready when Samavia called.\nI tried to help you to train yourself for any task. You never failed\nme.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" said The Rat, \"I began to work it out, and think it must\nbe true that night when we were with the old woman on the top of the\nmountain. It was the way she looked at--at His Highness.\"\n\n\"Say 'Marco,'\" threw in Prince Ivor. \"It's easier. He was my army,\nFather.\"\n\nStefan Loristan's grave eyes melted.\n\n\"Say 'Marco,'\" he said. \"You were his army--and more--when we both\nneeded one. It was you who invented the Game!\"\n\n\"Thanks, Your Majesty,\" said The Rat, reddening scarlet. \"You do me\ngreat honor! But he would never let me wait on him when we were\ntraveling. He said we were nothing but two boys. I suppose that's why\nit's hard to remember, at first. But my mind went on working until\nsometimes I was afraid I might let something out at the wrong time. When\nwe went down into the cavern, and I saw the Forgers of the Sword go mad\nover him--I _knew_ it must be true. But I didn't dare to speak. I knew you\nmeant us to wait; so I waited.\"\n\n\"You are a faithful friend,\" said the King, \"and you have always obeyed\norders!\"\n\nA great moon was sailing in the sky that night--just such a moon as had\nsailed among the torn rifts of storm clouds when the Prince at Vienna\nhad come out upon the balcony and the boyish voice had startled him from\nthe darkness of the garden below. The clearer light of this night's\nsplendor drew them out on a balcony also--a broad balcony of white\nmarble which looked like snow. The pure radiance fell upon all they saw\nspread before them--the lovely but half-ruined city, the great palace\nsquare with its broken statues and arches, the splendid ghost of the\nunroofed cathedral whose High Altar was bare to the sky.\n\nThey stood and looked at it. There was a stillness in which all the\nworld might have ceased breathing.\n\n\"What next?\" said Prince Ivor, at last speaking quietly and low. \"What\nnext, Father?\"\n\n\"Great things which will come, one by one,\" said the King, \"if we hold\nourselves ready.\"\n\nPrince Ivor turned his face from the lovely, white, broken city, and put\nhis brown hand on his father's arm.\n\n\"Upon the ledge that night--\" he said, \"Father, you remember--?\" The\nKing was looking far away, but he bent his head:\n\n\"Yes. That will come, too,\" he said. \"Can you repeat it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ivor, \"and so can the aide-de-camp. We've said it a hundred\ntimes. We believe it's true. 'If the descendant of the Lost Prince is\nbrought back to rule in Samavia, he will teach his people the Law of the\nOne, from his throne. He will teach his son, and that son will teach his\nson, and he will teach his. And through such as these, the whole world\nwill learn the Order and the Law.'\"",
