 "text": "THE LAND OF LITTLE RAIN\n\nby Mary Austin\n\n\nTO EVE\n\n\"The Comfortress of Unsuccess\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n          Preface\n          The Land of Little Rain\n          Water Trails of the Ceriso\n          The Scavengers\n          The Pocket Hunter\n          Shoshone Land\n          Jimville--A Bret Harte Town\n          My Neighbor's Field\n          The Mesa Trail\n          The Basket Maker\n          The Streets of the Mountains\n          Water Borders\n          Other Water Borders\n          Nurslings of the Sky\n          The Little Town of the Grape Vines\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nI confess to a great liking for the Indian fashion of name-giving: every\nman known by that phrase which best expresses him to whoso names him.\nThus he may be Mighty-Hunter, or Man-Afraid-of-a-Bear, according as he\nis called by friend or enemy, and Scar-Face to those who knew him by\nthe eye's grasp only. No other fashion, I think, sets so well with the\nvarious natures that inhabit in us, and if you agree with me you will\nunderstand why so few names are written here as they appear in the\ngeography. For if I love a lake known by the name of the man who\ndiscovered it, which endears itself by reason of the close-locked pines\nit nourishes about its borders, you may look in my account to find it so\ndescribed. But if the Indians have been there before me, you shall have\ntheir name, which is always beautifully fit and does not originate in\nthe poor human desire for perpetuity.\n\nNevertheless there are certain peaks, canons, and clear meadow spaces\nwhich are above all compassing of words, and have a certain fame as of\nthe nobly great to whom we give no familiar names. Guided by these you\nmay reach my country and find or not find, according as it lieth in you,\nmuch that is set down here. And more. The earth is no wanton to give up\nall her best to every comer, but keeps a sweet, separate intimacy\nfor each. But if you do not find it all as I write, think me not less\ndependable nor yourself less clever. There is a sort of pretense allowed\nin matters of the heart, as one should say by way of illustration,\n\"I know a man who...\" and so give up his dearest experience without\nbetrayal. And I am in no mind to direct you to delectable places toward\nwhich you will hold yourself less tenderly than I. So by this fashion\nof naming I keep faith with the land and annex to my own estate a very\ngreat territory to which none has a surer title.\n\nThe country where you may have sight and touch of that which is written\nlies between the high Sierras south from Yosemite--east and south over\na very great assemblage of broken ranges beyond Death Valley, and on\nillimitably into the Mojave Desert. You may come into the borders of\nit from the south by a stage journey that has the effect of involving\na great lapse of time, or from the north by rail, dropping out of the\noverland route at Reno. The best of all ways is over the Sierra passes\nby pack and trail, seeing and believing. But the real heart and core of\nthe country are not to be come at in a month's vacation. One must summer\nand winter with the land and wait its occasions. Pine woods that take\ntwo and three seasons to the ripening of cones, roots that lie by in\nthe sand seven years awaiting a growing rain, firs that grow fifty years\nbefore flowering,--these do not scrape acquaintance. But if ever you\ncome beyond the borders as far as the town that lies in a hill dimple at\nthe foot of Kearsarge, never leave it until you have knocked at the\ndoor of the brown house under the willow-tree at the end of the village\nstreet, and there you shall have such news of the land, of its trails\nand what is astir in them, as one lover of it can give to another.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAND OF LITTLE RAIN\n\nEast away from the Sierras, south from Panamint and Amargosa, east and\nsouth many an uncounted mile, is the Country of Lost Borders.\n\nUte, Paiute, Mojave, and Shoshone inhabit its frontiers, and as far into\nthe heart of it as a man dare go. Not the law, but the land sets the\nlimit. Desert is the name it wears upon the maps, but the Indian's is\nthe better word. Desert is a loose term to indicate land that supports\nno man; whether the land can be bitted and broken to that purpose is not\nproven. Void of life it never is, however dry the air and villainous the\nsoil.\n\nThis is the nature of that country. There are hills, rounded, blunt,\nburned, squeezed up out of chaos, chrome and vermilion painted, aspiring\nto the snowline. Between the hills lie high level-looking plains full\nof intolerable sun glare, or narrow valleys drowned in a blue haze.\nThe hill surface is streaked with ash drift and black, unweathered lava\nflows. After rains water accumulates in the hollows of small closed\nvalleys, and, evaporating, leaves hard dry levels of pure desertness\nthat get the local name of dry lakes. Where the mountains are steep\nand the rains heavy, the pool is never quite dry, but dark and bitter,\nrimmed about with the efflorescence of alkaline deposits. A thin crust\nof it lies along the marsh over the vegetating area, which has neither\nbeauty nor freshness. In the broad wastes open to the wind the sand\ndrifts in hummocks about the stubby shrubs, and between them the soil\nshows saline traces. The sculpture of the hills here is more wind than\nwater work, though the quick storms do sometimes scar them past many a\nyear's redeeming. In all the Western desert edges there are essays in\nminiature at the famed, terrible Grand Canon, to which, if you keep on\nlong enough in this country, you will come at last.\n\nSince this is a hill country one expects to find springs, but not\nto depend upon them; for when found they are often brackish and\nunwholesome, or maddening, slow dribbles in a thirsty soil. Here you\nfind the hot sink of Death Valley, or high rolling districts where\nthe air has always a tang of frost. Here are the long heavy winds and\nbreathless calms on the tilted mesas where dust devils dance, whirling\nup into a wide, pale sky. Here you have no rain when all the earth cries\nfor it, or quick downpours called cloud-bursts for violence. A land of\nlost rivers, with little in it to love; yet a land that once visited\nmust be come back to inevitably. If it were not so there would be little\ntold of it.\n\nThis is the country of three seasons. From June on to November it lies\nhot, still, and unbearable, sick with violent unrelieving storms; then\non until April, chill, quiescent, drinking its scant rain and scanter\nsnows; from April to the hot season again, blossoming, radiant, and\nseductive. These months are only approximate; later or earlier the\nrain-laden wind may drift up the water gate of the Colorado from the\nGulf, and the land sets its seasons by the rain.\n\nThe desert floras shame us with their cheerful adaptations to the\nseasonal limitations. Their whole duty is to flower and fruit, and they\ndo it hardly, or with tropical luxuriance, as the rain admits. It is\nrecorded in the report of the Death Valley expedition that after a\nyear of abundant rains, on the Colorado desert was found a specimen\nof Amaranthus ten feet high. A year later the same species in the same\nplace matured in the drought at four inches. One hopes the land may\nbreed like qualities in her human offspring, not tritely to \"try,\" but\nto do. Seldom does the desert herb attain the full stature of the type.\nExtreme aridity and extreme altitude have the same dwarfing effect, so\nthat we find in the high Sierras and in Death Valley related species in\nminiature that reach a comely growth in mean temperatures. Very fertile\nare the desert plants in expedients to prevent evaporation, turning\ntheir foliage edge-wise toward the sun, growing silky hairs, exuding\nviscid gum. The wind, which has a long sweep, harries and helps them. It\nrolls up dunes about the stocky stems, encompassing and protective, and\nabove the dunes, which may be, as with the mesquite, three times as high\nas a man, the blossoming twigs flourish and bear fruit.\n\nThere are many areas in the desert where drinkable water lies within a\nfew feet of the surface, indicated by the mesquite and the bunch grass\n(Sporobolus airoides). It is this nearness of unimagined help that makes\nthe tragedy of desert deaths. It is related that the final breakdown of\nthat hapless party that gave Death Valley its forbidding name occurred\nin a locality where shallow wells would have saved them. But how were\nthey to know that? Properly equipped it is possible to go safely across\nthat ghastly sink, yet every year it takes its toll of death, and yet\nmen find there sun-dried mummies, of whom no trace or recollection is\npreserved. To underestimate one's thirst, to pass a given landmark to\nthe right or left, to find a dry spring where one looked for running\nwater--there is no help for any of these things.\n\nAlong springs and sunken watercourses one is surprised to find such\nwater-loving plants as grow widely in moist ground, but the true desert\nbreeds its own kind, each in its particular habitat. The angle of the\nslope, the frontage of a hill, the structure of the soil determines\nthe plant. South-looking hills are nearly bare, and the lower tree-line\nhigher here by a thousand feet. Canons running east and west will have\none wall naked and one clothed. Around dry lakes and marshes the herbage\npreserves a set and orderly arrangement. Most species have well-defined\nareas of growth, the best index the voiceless land can give the traveler\nof his whereabouts.\n\nIf you have any doubt about it, know that the desert begins with the\ncreosote. This immortal shrub spreads down into Death Valley and up to\nthe lower timberline, odorous and medicinal as you might guess from\nthe name, wandlike, with shining fretted foliage. Its vivid green is\ngrateful to the eye in a wilderness of gray and greenish white shrubs.\nIn the spring it exudes a resinous gum which the Indians of those parts\nknow how to use with pulverized rock for cementing arrow points to\nshafts. Trust Indians not to miss any virtues of the plant world!\n\nNothing the desert produces expresses it better than the unhappy growth\nof the tree yuccas. Tormented, thin forests of it stalk drearily in the\nhigh mesas, particularly in that triangular slip that fans out eastward\nfrom the meeting of the Sierras and coastwise hills where the first\nswings across the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. The yucca\nbristles with bayonet-pointed leaves, dull green, growing shaggy with\nage, tipped with panicles of fetid, greenish bloom. After death, which\nis slow, the ghostly hollow network of its woody skeleton, with hardly\npower to rot, makes the moonlight fearful. Before the yucca has come to\nflower, while yet its bloom is a creamy cone-shaped bud of the size of\na small cabbage, full of sugary sap, the Indians twist it deftly out of\nits fence of daggers and roast it for their own delectation.\n\nSo it is that in those parts where man inhabits one sees young plants\nof Yucca arborensis infrequently. Other yuccas, cacti, low herbs, a\nthousand sorts, one finds journeying east from the coastwise hills.\nThere is neither poverty of soil nor species to account for the\nsparseness of desert growth, but simply that each plant requires more\nroom. So much earth must be preempted to extract so much moisture.\nThe real struggle for existence, the real brain of the plant, is\nunderground; above there is room for a rounded perfect growth. In Death\nValley, reputed the very core of desolation, are nearly two hundred\nidentified species.\n\nAbove the lower tree-line, which is also the snowline, mapped out\nabruptly by the sun, one finds spreading growth of pinon, juniper,\nbranched nearly to the ground, lilac and sage, and scattering white\npines.\n\nThere is no special preponderance of self-fertilized or wind-fertilized\nplants, but everywhere the demand for and evidence of insect life. Now\nwhere there are seeds and insects there will be birds and small mammals\nand where these are, will come the slinking, sharp-toothed kind that\nprey on them. Go as far as you dare in the heart of a lonely land, you\ncannot go so far that life and death are not before you. Painted lizards\nslip in and out of rock crevices, and pant on the white hot sands.\nBirds, hummingbirds even, nest in the cactus scrub; woodpeckers befriend\nthe demoniac yuccas; out of the stark, treeless waste rings the music\nof the night-singing mockingbird. If it be summer and the sun well down,\nthere will be a burrowing owl to call. Strange, furry, tricksy things\ndart across the open places, or sit motionless in the conning towers of\nthe creosote. The poet may have \"named all the birds without a gun,\"\nbut not the fairy-footed, ground-inhabiting, furtive, small folk of the\nrainless regions. They are too many and too swift; how many you would\nnot believe without seeing the footprint tracings in the sand. They\nare nearly all night workers, finding the days too hot and white. In\nmid-desert where there are no cattle, there are no birds of carrion,\nbut if you go far in that direction the chances are that you will find\nyourself shadowed by their tilted wings. Nothing so large as a man can\nmove unspied upon in that country, and they know well how the land deals\nwith strangers. There are hints to be had here of the way in which a\nland forces new habits on its dwellers. The quick increase of suns at\nthe end of spring sometimes overtakes birds in their nesting and effects\na reversal of the ordinary manner of incubation. It becomes necessary to\nkeep eggs cool rather than warm. One hot, stifling spring in the Little\nAntelope I had occasion to pass and repass frequently the nest of a pair\nof meadowlarks, located unhappily in the shelter of a very slender\nweed. I never caught them sitting except near night, but at mid-day they\nstood, or drooped above it, half fainting with pitifully parted bills,\nbetween their treasure and the sun. Sometimes both of them together with\nwings spread and half lifted continued a spot of shade in a temperature\nthat constrained me at last in a fellow feeling to spare them a bit of\ncanvas for permanent shelter. There was a fence in that country shutting\nin a cattle range, and along its fifteen miles of posts one could be\nsure of finding a bird or two in every strip of shadow; sometimes the\nsparrow and the hawk, with wings trailed and beaks parted, drooping in\nthe white truce of noon.\n\nIf one is inclined to wonder at first how so many dwellers came to be in\nthe loneliest land that ever came out of God's hands, what they do there\nand why stay, one does not wonder so much after having lived there. None\nother than this long brown land lays such a hold on the affections. The\nrainbow hills, the tender bluish mists, the luminous radiance of the\nspring, have the lotus charm. They trick the sense of time, so that once\ninhabiting there you always mean to go away without quite realizing that\nyou have not done it. Men who have lived there, miners and cattlemen,\nwill tell you this, not so fluently, but emphatically, cursing the land\nand going back to it. For one thing there is the divinest, cleanest\nair to be breathed anywhere in God's world. Some day the world will\nunderstand that, and the little oases on the windy tops of hills will\nharbor for healing its ailing, house-weary broods. There is promise\nthere of great wealth in ores and earths, which is no wealth by reason\nof being so far removed from water and workable conditions, but men are\nbewitched by it and tempted to try the impossible.\n\nYou should hear Salty Williams tell how he used to drive eighteen and\ntwenty-mule teams from the borax marsh to Mojave, ninety miles, with the\ntrail wagon full of water barrels. Hot days the mules would go so mad\nfor drink that the clank of the water bucket set them into an uproar\nof hideous, maimed noises, and a tangle of harness chains, while Salty\nwould sit on the high seat with the sun glare heavy in his eyes, dealing\nout curses of pacification in a level, uninterested voice until the\nclamor fell off from sheer exhaustion. There was a line of shallow\ngraves along that road; they used to count on dropping a man or two of\nevery new gang of coolies brought out in the hot season. But when he\nlost his swamper, smitten without warning at the noon halt, Salty quit\nhis job; he said it was \"too durn hot.\" The swamper he buried by the way\nwith stones upon him to keep the coyotes from digging him up, and seven\nyears later I read the penciled lines on the pine head-board, still\nbright and unweathered.\n\nBut before that, driving up on the Mojave stage, I met Salty again\ncrossing Indian Wells, his face from the high seat, tanned and ruddy\nas a harvest moon, looming through the golden dust above his eighteen\nmules. The land had called him.\n\nThe palpable sense of mystery in the desert air breeds fables, chiefly\nof lost treasure. Somewhere within its stark borders, if one believes\nreport, is a hill strewn with nuggets; one seamed with virgin silver; an\nold clayey water-bed where Indians scooped up earth to make cooking pots\nand shaped them reeking with grains of pure gold. Old miners drifting\nabout the desert edges, weathered into the semblance of the tawny hills,\nwill tell you tales like these convincingly. After a little sojourn in\nthat land you will believe them on their own account. It is a question\nwhether it is not better to be bitten by the little horned snake of\nthe desert that goes sidewise and strikes without coiling, than by the\ntradition of a lost mine.\n\nAnd yet--and yet--is it not perhaps to satisfy expectation that one\nfalls into the tragic key in writing of desertness? The more you wish of\nit the more you get, and in the mean time lose much of pleasantness. In\nthat country which begins at the foot of the east slope of the Sierras\nand spreads out by less and less lofty hill ranges toward the Great\nBasin, it is possible to live with great zest, to have red blood and\ndelicate joys, to pass and repass about one's daily performance an area\nthat would make an Atlantic seaboard State, and that with no peril, and,\naccording to our way of thought, no particular difficulty. At any rate,\nit was not people who went into the desert merely to write it up who\ninvented the fabled Hassaympa, of whose waters, if any drink, they\ncan no more see fact as naked fact, but all radiant with the color\nof romance. I, who must have drunk of it in my twice seven years'\nwanderings, am assured that it is worth while.\n\nFor all the toll the desert takes of a man it gives compensations, deep\nbreaths, deep sleep, and the communion of the stars. It comes upon one\nwith new force in the pauses of the night that the Chaldeans were a\ndesert-bred people. It is hard to escape the sense of mastery as the\nstars move in the wide clear heavens to risings and settings unobscured.\nThey look large and near and palpitant; as if they moved on some stately\nservice not needful to declare. Wheeling to their stations in the sky,\nthey make the poor world-fret of no account. Of no account you who lie\nout there watching, nor the lean coyote that stands off in the scrub\nfrom you and howls and howls.\n\n\n\n\nWATER TRAILS OF THE CERISO\n\nBy the end of the dry season the water trails of the Ceriso are worn to\na white ribbon in the leaning grass, spread out faint and fanwise toward\nthe homes of gopher and ground rat and squirrel. But however faint to\nman-sight, they are sufficiently plain to the furred and feathered folk\nwho travel them. Getting down to the eye level of rat and squirrel kind,\none perceives what might easily be wide and winding roads to us if they\noccurred in thick plantations of trees three times the height of a man.\nIt needs but a slender thread of barrenness to make a mouse trail in the\nforest of the sod. To the little people the water trails are as country\nroads, with scents as signboards.\n\nIt seems that man-height is the least fortunate of all heights from\nwhich to study trails. It is better to go up the front of some tall\nhill, say the spur of Black Mountain, looking back and down across the\nhollow of the Ceriso. Strange how long the soil keeps the impression of\nany continuous treading, even after grass has overgrown it. Twenty years\nsince, a brief heyday of mining at Black Mountain made a stage road\nacross the Ceriso, yet the parallel lines that are the wheel traces show\nfrom the height dark and well defined. Afoot in the Ceriso one looks in\nvain for any sign of it. So all the paths that wild creatures use going\ndown to the Lone Tree Spring are mapped out whitely from this level,\nwhich is also the level of the hawks.\n\nThere is little water in the Ceriso at the best of times, and that\nlittle brackish and smelling vilely, but by a lone juniper where the\nrim of the Ceriso breaks away to the lower country, there is a perpetual\nrill of fresh sweet drink in the midst of lush grass and watercress. In\nthe dry season there is no water else for a man's long journey of a\nday. East to the foot of Black Mountain, and north and south without\ncounting, are the burrows of small rodents, rat and squirrel kind. Under\nthe sage are the shallow forms of the jackrabbits, and in the dry\nbanks of washes, and among the strewn fragments of black rock, lairs of\nbobcat, fox, and coyote.\n\nThe coyote is your true water-witch, one who snuffs and paws, snuffs and\npaws again at the smallest spot of moisture-scented earth until he has\nfreed the blind water from the soil. Many water-holes are no more than\nthis detected by the lean hobo of the hills in localities where not even\nan Indian would look for it.\n\nIt is the opinion of many wise and busy people that the hill-folk pass\nthe ten-month interval between the end and renewal of winter rains, with\nno drink; but your true idler, with days and nights to spend beside the\nwater trails, will not subscribe to it. The trails begin, as I said,\nvery far back in the Ceriso, faintly, and converge in one span broad,\nwhite, hard-trodden way in the gully of the spring. And why trails if\nthere are no travelers in that direction?\n\nI have yet to find the land not scarred by the thin, far roadways of\nrabbits and what not of furry folks that run in them. Venture to look\nfor some seldom-touched water-hole, and so long as the trails run with\nyour general direction make sure you are right, but if they begin to\ncross yours at never so slight an angle, to converge toward a point left\nor right of your objective, no matter what the maps say, or your memory,\ntrust them; they know.\n\nIt is very still in the Ceriso by day, so that were it not for the\nevidence of those white beaten ways, it might be the desert it looks.\nThe sun is hot in the dry season, and the days are filled with the\nglare of it. Now and again some unseen coyote signals his pack in a\nlong-drawn, dolorous whine that comes from no determinate point, but\nnothing stirs much before mid-afternoon. It is a sign when there begin\nto be hawks skimming above the sage that the little people are going\nabout their business.\n\nWe have fallen on a very careless usage, speaking of wild creatures as\nif they were bound by some such limitation as hampers clockwork. When we\nsay of one and another, they are night prowlers, it is perhaps true only\nas the things they feed upon are more easily come by in the dark, and\nthey know well how to adjust themselves to conditions wherein food is\nmore plentiful by day. And their accustomed performance is very much\na matter of keen eye, keener scent, quick ear, and a better memory of\nsights and sounds than man dares boast. Watch a coyote come out of his\nlair and cast about in his mind where he will go for his daily killing.\nYou cannot very well tell what decides him, but very easily that he has\ndecided. He trots or breaks into short gallops, with very perceptible\npauses to look up and about at landmarks, alters his tack a little,\nlooking forward and back to steer his proper course.\n\nI am persuaded that the coyotes in my valley, which is narrow and beset\nwith steep, sharp hills, in long passages steer by the pinnacles of\nthe sky-line, going with head cocked to one side to keep to the left or\nright of such and such a promontory.\n\nI have trailed a coyote often, going across country, perhaps to where\nsome slant-winged scavenger hanging in the air signaled prospect of\na dinner, and found his track such as a man, a very intelligent man\naccustomed to a hill country, and a little cautious, would make to the\nsame point. Here a detour to avoid a stretch of too little cover, there\na pause on the rim of a gully to pick the better way,--and it is usually\nthe best way,--and making his point with the greatest economy of effort.\nSince the time of Seyavi the deer have shifted their feeding ground\nacross the valley at the beginning of deep snows, by way of the Black\nRock, fording the river at Charley's Butte, and making straight for the\nmouth of the canon that is the easiest going to the winter pastures on\nWaban. So they still cross, though whatever trail they had has been long\nbroken by ploughed ground; but from the mouth of Tinpah Creek, where\nthe deer come out of the Sierras, it is easily seen that the creek, the\npoint of Black Rock, and Charley's Butte are in line with the wide bulk\nof shade that is the foot of Waban Pass. And along with this the deer\nhave learned that Charley's Butte is almost the only possible ford,\nand all the shortest crossing of the valley. It seems that the wild\ncreatures have learned all that is important to their way of life\nexcept the changes of the moon. I have seen some prowling fox or coyote,\nsurprised by its sudden rising from behind the mountain wall, slink in\nits increasing glow, watch it furtively from the cover of near-by brush,\nunprepared and half uncertain of its identity until it rode clear of the\npeaks, and finally make off with all the air of one caught napping by an\nancient joke. The moon in its wanderings must be a sort of exasperation\nto cunning beasts, likely to spoil by untimely risings some fore-planned\nmischief.\n\nBut to take the trail again; the coyotes that are astir in the Ceriso of\nlate afternoons, harrying the rabbits from their shallow forms, and the\nhawks that sweep and swing above them, are not there from any mechanical\npromptings of instinct, but because they know of old experience that the\nsmall fry are about to take to seed gathering and the water trails. The\nrabbits begin it, taking the trail with long, light leaps, one eye and\near cocked to the hills from whence a coyote might descend upon them at\nany moment. Rabbits are a foolish people. They do not fight except with\ntheir own kind, nor use their paws except for feet, and appear to have\nno reason for existence but to furnish meals for meat-eaters. In flight\nthey seem to rebound from the earth of their own elasticity, but keep a\nsober pace going to the spring. It is the young watercress that tempts\nthem and the pleasures of society, for they seldom drink. Even in\nlocalities where there are flowing streams they seem to prefer the\nmoisture that collects on herbage, and after rains may be seen rising on\ntheir haunches to drink delicately the clear drops caught in the tops of\nthe young sage. But drink they must, as I have often seen them mornings\nand evenings at the rill that goes by my door. Wait long enough at the\nLone Tree Spring and sooner or later they will all come in. But here\ntheir matings are accomplished, and though they are fearful of so little\nas a cloud shadow or blown leaf, they contrive to have some playful\nhours. At the spring the bobcat drops down upon them from the black\nrock, and the red fox picks them up returning in the dark. By day the\nhawk and eagle overshadow them, and the coyote has all times and seasons\nfor his own.\n\nCattle, when there are any in the Ceriso, drink morning and evening,\nspending the night on the warm last lighted slopes of neighboring hills,\nstirring with the peep o' day. In these half wild spotted steers the\nhabits of an earlier lineage persist. It must be long since they have\nmade beds for themselves, but before lying down they turn themselves\nround and round as dogs do. They choose bare and stony ground, exposed\nfronts of westward facing hills, and lie down in companies. Usually by\nthe end of the summer the cattle have been driven or gone of their own\nchoosing to the mountain meadows. One year a maverick yearling, strayed\nor overlooked by the vaqueros, kept on until the season's end, and so\nbetrayed another visitor to the spring that else I might have missed.\nOn a certain morning the half-eaten carcass lay at the foot of the black\nrock, and in moist earth by the rill of the spring, the foot-pads of a\ncougar, puma, mountain lion, or whatever the beast is rightly called.\nThe kill must have been made early in the evening, for it appeared that\nthe cougar had been twice to the spring; and since the meat-eater drinks\nlittle until he has eaten, he must have fed and drunk, and after an\ninterval of lying up in the black rock, had eaten and drunk again. There\nwas no knowing how far he had come, but if he came again the second\nnight he found that the coyotes had left him very little of his kill.\n\nNobody ventures to say how infrequently and at what hour the small fry\nvisit the spring. There are such numbers of them that if each came once\nbetween the last of spring and the first of winter rains, there would\nstill be water trails. I have seen badgers drinking about the hour when\nthe light takes on the yellow tinge it has from coming slantwise through\nthe hills. They find out shallow places, and are loath to wet their\nfeet. Rats and chipmunks have been observed visiting the spring as late\nas nine o'clock mornings.\n\nThe larger spermophiles that live near the spring and keep awake to work\nall day, come and go at no particular hour, drinking sparingly. At long\nintervals on half-lighted days, meadow and field mice steal delicately\nalong the trail. These visitors are all too small to be watched\ncarefully at night, but for evidence of their frequent coming there are\nthe trails that may be traced miles out among the crisping grasses. On\nrare nights, in the places where no grass grows between the shrubs, and\nthe sand silvers whitely to the moon, one sees them whisking to and fro\non innumerable errands of seed gathering, but the chief witnesses of\ntheir presence near the spring are the elf owls. Those burrow-haunting,\nspeckled fluffs of greediness begin a twilight flitting toward the\nspring, feeding as they go on grasshoppers, lizards, and small, swift\ncreatures, diving into burrows to catch field mice asleep, battling with\nchipmunks at their own doors, and getting down in great numbers toward\nthe long juniper. Now owls do not love water greatly on its own account.\nNot to my knowledge have I caught one drinking or bathing, though on\nnight wanderings across the mesa they flit up from under the horse's\nfeet along stream borders. Their presence near the spring in great\nnumbers would indicate the presence of the things they feed upon. All\nnight the rustle and soft hooting keeps on in the neighborhood of the\nspring, with seldom small shrieks of mortal agony. It is clear day\nbefore they have all gotten back to their particular hummocks, and if\none follows cautiously, not to frighten them into some near-by burrow,\nit is possible to trail them far up the slope.\n\nThe crested quail that troop in the Ceriso are the happiest frequenters\nof the water trails. There is no furtiveness about their morning drink.\nAbout the time the burrowers and all that feed upon them are addressing\nthemselves to sleep, great flocks pour down the trails with that\npeculiar melting motion of moving quail, twittering, shoving, and\nshouldering. They splatter into the shallows, drink daintily, shake out\nsmall showers over their perfect coats, and melt away again into the\nscrub, preening and pranking, with soft contented noises.\n\nAfter the quail, sparrows and ground-inhabiting birds bathe with the\nutmost frankness and a great deal of splutter; and here in the heart of\nnoon hawks resort, sitting panting, with wings aslant, and a truce to\nall hostilities because of the heat. One summer there came a road-runner\nup from the lower valley, peeking and prying, and he had never any\npatience with the water baths of the sparrows. His own ablutions were\nperformed in the clean, hopeful dust of the chaparral; and whenever\nhe happened on their morning splatterings, he would depress his glossy\ncrest, slant his shining tail to the level of his body, until he looked\nmost like some bright venomous snake, daunting them with shrill abuse\nand feint of battle. Then suddenly he would go tilting and balancing\ndown the gully in fine disdain, only to return in a day or two to make\nsure the foolish bodies were still at it.\n\nOut on the Ceriso about five miles, and wholly out of sight of it, near\nwhere the immemorial foot trail goes up from Saline Flat toward Black\nMountain, is a water sign worth turning out of the trail to see. It is\na laid circle of stones large enough not to be disturbed by any ordinary\nhap, with an opening flanked by two parallel rows of similar stones,\nbetween which were an arrow placed, touching the opposite rim of the\ncircle, thus it would point as the crow flies to the spring. It is the\nold, indubitable water mark of the Shoshones. One still finds it in the\ndesert ranges in Salt Wells and Mesquite valleys, and along the slopes\nof Waban. On the other side of Ceriso, where the black rock begins,\nabout a mile from the spring, is the work of an older, forgotten people.\nThe rock hereabout is all volcanic, fracturing with a crystalline\nwhitish surface, but weathered outside to furnace blackness. Around\nthe spring, where must have been a gathering place of the tribes, it is\nscored over with strange pictures and symbols that have no meaning to\nthe Indians of the present day; but out where the rock begins, there is\ncarved into the white heart of it a pointing arrow over the symbol\nfor distance and a circle full of wavy lines reading thus: \"In this\ndirection three [units of measurement unknown] is a spring of sweet\nwater; look for it.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE SCAVENGERS\n\nFifty-seven buzzards, one on each of fifty-seven fence posts at the\nrancho El Tejon, on a mirage-breeding September morning, sat solemnly\nwhile the white tilted travelers' vans lumbered down the Canada de los\nUvas. After three hours they had only clapped their wings, or exchanged\nposts. The season's end in the vast dim valley of the San Joaquin is\npalpitatingly hot, and the air breathes like cotton wool. Through it\nall the buzzards sit on the fences and low hummocks, with wings spread\nfanwise for air. There is no end to them, and they smell to heaven.\nTheir heads droop, and all their communication is a rare, horrid croak.\n\nThe increase of wild creatures is in proportion to the things they\nfeed upon: the more carrion the more buzzards. The end of the third\nsuccessive dry year bred them beyond belief. The first year quail mated\nsparingly; the second year the wild oats matured no seed; the third,\ncattle died in their tracks with their heads towards the stopped\nwatercourses. And that year the scavengers were as black as the plague\nall across the mesa and up the treeless, tumbled hills. On clear days\nthey betook themselves to the upper air, where they hung motionless for\nhours. That year there were vultures among them, distinguished by the\nwhite patches under the wings. All their offensiveness notwithstanding,\nthey have a stately flight. They must also have what pass for good\nqualities among themselves, for they are social, not to say clannish.\n\nIt is a very squalid tragedy,--that of the dying brutes and the\nscavenger birds. Death by starvation is slow. The heavy-headed,\nrack-boned cattle totter in the fruitless trails; they stand for long,\npatient intervals; they lie down and do not rise. There is fear in\ntheir eyes when they are first stricken, but afterward only intolerable\nweariness. I suppose the dumb creatures know nearly as much of death\nas do their betters, who have only the more imagination. Their\neven-breathing submission after the first agony is their tribute to\nits inevitableness. It needs a nice discrimination to say which of\nthe basket-ribbed cattle is likest to afford the next meal, but the\nscavengers make few mistakes. One stoops to the quarry and the flock\nfollows.\n\nCattle once down may be days in dying. They stretch out their necks\nalong the ground, and roll up their slow eyes at longer intervals. The\nbuzzards have all the time, and no beak is dropped or talon struck until\nthe breath is wholly passed. It is doubtless the economy of nature to\nhave the scavengers by to clean up the carrion, but a wolf at the throat\nwould be a shorter agony than the long stalking and sometime perchings\nof these loathsome watchers. Suppose now it were a man in this\nlong-drawn, hungrily spied upon distress! When Timmie O'Shea was lost on\nArmogosa Flats for three days without water, Long Tom Basset found him,\nnot by any trail, but by making straight away for the points where he\nsaw buzzards stooping. He could hear the beat of their wings, Tom said,\nand trod on their shadows, but O'Shea was past recalling what he thought\nabout things after the second day. My friend Ewan told me, among other\nthings, when he came back from San Juan Hill, that not all the carnage\nof battle turned his bowels as the sight of slant black wings rising\nflockwise before the burial squad.\n\nThere are three kinds of noises buzzards make,--it is impossible to call\nthem notes,--raucous and elemental. There is a short croak of alarm,\nand the same syllable in a modified tone to serve all the purposes of\nordinary conversation. The old birds make a kind of throaty chuckling\nto their young, but if they have any love song I have not heard it.\nThe young yawp in the nest a little, with more breath than noise. It is\nseldom one finds a buzzard's nest, seldom that grown-ups find a nest of\nany sort; it is only children to whom these things happen by right. But\nby making a business of it one may come upon them in wide, quiet canons,\nor on the lookouts of lonely, table-topped mountains, three or four\ntogether, in the tops of stubby trees or on rotten cliffs well open to\nthe sky.\n\nIt is probable that the buzzard is gregarious, but it seems unlikely\nfrom the small number of young noted at any time that every female\nincubates each year. The young birds are easily distinguished by their\nsize when feeding, and high up in air by the worn primaries of the older\nbirds. It is when the young go out of the nest on their first foraging\nthat the parents, full of a crass and simple pride, make their\nindescribable chucklings of gobbling, gluttonous delight. The little\nones would be amusing as they tug and tussle, if one could forget what\nit is they feed upon.\n\nOne never comes any nearer to the vulture's nest or nestlings than\nhearsay. They keep to the southerly Sierras, and are bold enough, it\nseems, to do killing on their own account when no carrion is at hand.\nThey dog the shepherd from camp to camp, the hunter home from the hill,\nand will even carry away offal from under his hand.\n\nThe vulture merits respect for his bigness and for his bandit airs, but\nhe is a sombre bird, with none of the buzzard's frank satisfaction in\nhis offensiveness.\n\nThe least objectionable of the inland scavengers is the raven,\nfrequenter of the desert ranges, the same called locally \"carrion crow.\"\nHe is handsomer and has such an air. He is nice in his habits and is\nsaid to have likable traits. A tame one in a Shoshone camp was the butt\nof much sport and enjoyed it. He could all but talk and was another with\nthe children, but an arrant thief. The raven will eat most things that\ncome his way,--eggs and young of ground-nesting birds, seeds even,\nlizards and grasshoppers, which he catches cleverly; and whatever he\nis about, let a coyote trot never so softly by, the raven flaps up and\nafter; for whatever the coyote can pull down or nose out is meat also\nfor the carrion crow.\n\nAnd never a coyote comes out of his lair for killing, in the country\nof the carrion crows, but looks up first to see where they may be\ngathering. It is a sufficient occupation for a windy morning, on\nthe lineless, level mesa, to watch the pair of them eying each other\nfurtively, with a tolerable assumption of unconcern, but no doubt with\na certain amount of good understanding about it. Once at Red Rock, in\na year of green pasture, which is a bad time for the scavengers, we saw\ntwo buzzards, five ravens, and a coyote feeding on the same carrion, and\nonly the coyote seemed ashamed of the company.\n\nProbably we never fully credit the interdependence of wild creatures,\nand their cognizance of the affairs of their own kind. When the five\ncoyotes that range the Tejon from Pasteria to Tunawai planned a relay\nrace to bring down an antelope strayed from the band, beside myself to\nwatch, an eagle swung down from Mt. Pinos, buzzards materialized out\nof invisible ether, and hawks came trooping like small boys to a street\nfight. Rabbits sat up in the chaparral and cocked their ears, feeling\nthemselves quite safe for the once as the hunt swung near them. Nothing\nhappens in the deep wood that the blue jays are not all agog to tell.\nThe hawk follows the badger, the coyote the carrion crow, and from\ntheir aerial stations the buzzards watch each other. What would be worth\nknowing is how much of their neighbor's affairs the new generations\nlearn for themselves, and how much they are taught of their elders.\n\nSo wide is the range of the scavengers that it is never safe to say,\neyewitness to the contrary, that there are few or many in such a place.\nWhere the carrion is, there will the buzzards be gathered together, and\nin three days' journey you will not sight another one. The way up from\nMojave to Red Butte is all desertness, affording no pasture and scarcely\na rill of water. In a year of little rain in the south, flocks and herds\nwere driven to the number of thousands along this road to the perennial\npastures of the high ranges. It is a long, slow trail, ankle deep in\nbitter dust that gets up in the slow wind and moves along the backs of\nthe crawling cattle. In the worst of times one in three will pine and\nfall out by the way. In the defiles of Red Rock, the sheep piled up a\nstinking lane; it was the sun smiting by day. To these shambles came\nbuzzards, vultures, and coyotes from all the country round, so that on\nthe Tejon, the Ceriso, and the Little Antelope there were not scavengers\nenough to keep the country clean. All that summer the dead mummified in\nthe open or dropped slowly back to earth in the quagmires of the bitter\nsprings. Meanwhile from Red Rock to Coyote Holes, and from Coyote Holes\nto Haiwai the scavengers gorged and gorged.\n\nThe coyote is not a scavenger by choice, preferring his own kill,\nbut being on the whole a lazy dog, is apt to fall into carrion eating\nbecause it is easier. The red fox and bobcat, a little pressed by\nhunger, will eat of any other animal's kill, but will not ordinarily\ntouch what dies of itself, and are exceedingly shy of food that has been\nman-handled.\n\nVery clean and handsome, quite belying his relationship in appearance,\nis Clark's crow, that scavenger and plunderer of mountain camps. It is\npermissible to call him by his common name, \"Camp Robber:\" he has earned\nit. Not content with refuse, he pecks open meal sacks, filches whole\npotatoes, is a gormand for bacon, drills holes in packing cases, and is\ndaunted by nothing short of tin. All the while he does not neglect to\nvituperate the chipmunks and sparrows that whisk off crumbs of comfort\nfrom under the camper's feet. The Camp Robber's gray coat, black and\nwhite barred wings, and slender bill, with certain tricks of perching,\naccuse him of attempts to pass himself off among woodpeckers; but his\nbehavior is all crow. He frequents the higher pine belts, and has a\nnoisy strident call like a jay's, and how clean he and the frisk-tailed\nchipmunks keep the camp! No crumb or paring or bit of eggshell goes\namiss.\n\nHigh as the camp may be, so it is not above timberline, it is not too\nhigh for the coyote, the bobcat, or the wolf. It is the complaint of the\nordinary camper that the woods are too still, depleted of wild life. But\nwhat dead body of wild thing, or neglected game untouched by its kind,\ndo you find? And put out offal away from camp over night, and look next\nday at the foot tracks where it lay.\n\nMan is a great blunderer going about in the woods, and there is no other\nexcept the bear makes so much noise. Being so well warned beforehand,\nit is a very stupid animal, or a very bold one, that cannot keep safely\nhid. The cunningest hunter is hunted in turn, and what he leaves of his\nkill is meat for some other. That is the economy of nature, but with it\nall there is not sufficient account taken of the works of man. There\nis no scavenger that eats tin cans, and no wild thing leaves a like\ndisfigurement on the forest floor.\n\n\n\n\nTHE POCKET HUNTER\n\nI remember very well when I first met him. Walking in the evening glow\nto spy the marriages of the white gilias, I sniffed the unmistakable\nodor of burning sage. It is a smell that carries far and indicates\nusually the nearness of a campoodie, but on the level mesa nothing\ntaller showed than Diana's sage. Over the tops of it, beginning to dusk\nunder a young white moon, trailed a wavering ghost of smoke, and at\nthe end of it I came upon the Pocket Hunter making a dry camp in the\nfriendly scrub. He sat tailor-wise in the sand, with his coffee-pot on\nthe coals, his supper ready to hand in the frying-pan, and himself in\na mood for talk. His pack burros in hobbles strayed off to hunt for a\nwetter mouthful than the sage afforded, and gave him no concern.\n\nWe came upon him often after that, threading the windy passes, or by\nwater-holes in the desert hills, and got to know much of his way of\nlife. He was a small, bowed man, with a face and manner and speech of\nno character at all, as if he had that faculty of small hunted things of\ntaking on the protective color of his surroundings. His clothes were of\nno fashion that I could remember, except that they bore liberal markings\nof pot black, and he had a curious fashion of going about with his\nmouth open, which gave him a vacant look until you came near enough to\nperceive him busy about an endless hummed, wordless tune. He traveled\nfar and took a long time to it, but the simplicity of his kitchen\narrangements was elemental. A pot for beans, a coffee-pot, a frying-pan,\na tin to mix bread in--he fed the burros in this when there was\nneed--with these he had been half round our western world and back. He\nexplained to me very early in our acquaintance what was good to take to\nthe hills for food: nothing sticky, for that \"dirtied the pots;\" nothing\nwith \"juice\" to it, for that would not pack to advantage; and nothing\nlikely to ferment. He used no gun, but he would set snares by the\nwater-holes for quail and doves, and in the trout country he carried a\nline. Burros he kept, one or two according to his pack, for this chief\nexcellence, that they would eat potato parings and firewood. He had\nowned a horse in the foothill country, but when he came to the desert\nwith no forage but mesquite, he found himself under the necessity of\npicking the beans from the briers, a labor that drove him to the use of\npack animals to whom thorns were a relish.\n\nI suppose no man becomes a pocket hunter by first intention. He must be\nborn with the faculty, and along comes the occasion, like the tap on\nthe test tube that induces crystallization. My friend had been several\nthings of no moment until he struck a thousand-dollar pocket in the Lee\nDistrict and came into his vocation. A pocket, you must know, is a small\nbody of rich ore occurring by itself, or in a vein of poorer stuff.\nNearly every mineral ledge contains such, if only one has the luck to\nhit upon them without too much labor. The sensible thing for a man to\ndo who has found a good pocket is to buy himself into business and keep\naway from the hills. The logical thing is to set out looking for another\none. My friend the Pocket Hunter had been looking twenty years. His\nworking outfit was a shovel, a pick, a gold pan which he kept cleaner\nthan his plate, and a pocket magnifier. When he came to a watercourse\nhe would pan out the gravel of its bed for \"colors,\" and under the glass\ndetermine if they had come from far or near, and so spying he would work\nup the stream until he found where the drift of the gold-bearing outcrop\nfanned out into the creek; then up the side of the canon till he came\nto the proper vein. I think he said the best indication of small pockets\nwas an iron stain, but I could never get the run of miner's talk enough\nto feel instructed for pocket hunting. He had another method in the\nwaterless hills, where he would work in and out of blind gullies and all\nwindings of the manifold strata that appeared not to have cooled since\nthey had been heaved up. His itinerary began with the east slope of the\nSierras of the Snows, where that range swings across to meet the coast\nhills, and all up that slope to the Truckee River country, where the\nlong cold forbade his progress north. Then he worked back down one or\nanother of the nearly parallel ranges that lie out desertward, and\nso down to the sink of the Mojave River, burrowing to oblivion in the\nsand,--a big mysterious land, a lonely, inhospitable land, beautiful,\nterrible. But he came to no harm in it; the land tolerated him as it\nmight a gopher or a badger. Of all its inhabitants it has the least\nconcern for man.\n\nThere are many strange sorts of humans bred in a mining country, each\nsort despising the queernesses of the other, but of them all I found the\nPocket Hunter most acceptable for his clean, companionable talk. There\nwas more color to his reminiscences than the faded sandy old miners\n\"kyoteing,\" that is, tunneling like a coyote (kyote in the vernacular)\nin the core of a lonesome hill. Such a one has found, perhaps, a body of\ntolerable ore in a poor lead,--remember that I can never be depended on\nto get the terms right,--and followed it into the heart of country rock\nto no profit, hoping, burrowing, and hoping. These men go harmlessly mad\nin time, believing themselves just behind the wall of fortune--most\nlikable and simple men, for whom it is well to do any kindly thing that\noccurs to you except lend them money. I have known \"grub stakers\" too,\nthose persuasive sinners to whom you make allowances of flour and pork\nand coffee in consideration of the ledges they are about to find; but\nnone of these proved so much worth while as the Pocket Hunter. He wanted\nnothing of you and maintained a cheerful preference for his own way of\nlife. It was an excellent way if you had the constitution for it. The\nPocket Hunter had gotten to that point where he knew no bad weather, and\nall places were equally happy so long as they were out of doors. I do\nnot know just how long it takes to become saturated with the elements so\nthat one takes no account of them. Myself can never get past the glow\nand exhilaration of a storm, the wrestle of long dust-heavy winds, the\nplay of live thunder on the rocks, nor past the keen fret of fatigue\nwhen the storm outlasts physical endurance. But prospectors and Indians\nget a kind of a weather shell that remains on the body until death.\n\nThe Pocket Hunter had seen destruction by the violence of nature and\nthe violence of men, and felt himself in the grip of an All-wisdom that\nkilled men or spared them as seemed for their good; but of death by\nsickness he knew nothing except that he believed he should never suffer\nit. He had been in Grape-vine Canon the year of storms that changed the\nwhole front of the mountain. All day he had come down under the wing\nof the storm, hoping to win past it, but finding it traveling with him\nuntil night. It kept on after that, he supposed, a steady downpour,\nbut could not with certainty say, being securely deep in sleep. But the\nweather instinct does not sleep. In the night the heavens behind the\nhill dissolved in rain, and the roar of the storm was borne in and mixed\nwith his dreaming, so that it moved him, still asleep, to get up and out\nof the path of it. What finally woke him was the crash of pine logs as\nthey went down before the unbridled flood, and the swirl of foam that\nlashed him where he clung in the tangle of scrub while the wall of\nwater went by. It went on against the cabin of Bill Gerry and laid Bill\nstripped and broken on a sand bar at the mouth of the Grape-vine, seven\nmiles away. There, when the sun was up and the wrath of the rain spent,\nthe Pocket Hunter found and buried him; but he never laid his own escape\nat any door but the unintelligible favor of the Powers.\n\nThe journeyings of the Pocket Hunter led him often into that mysterious\ncountry beyond Hot Creek where a hidden force works mischief, mole-like,\nunder the crust of the earth. Whatever agency is at work in that\nneighborhood, and it is popularly supposed to be the devil, it changes\nmeans and direction without time or season. It creeps up whole hillsides\nwith insidious heat, unguessed until one notes the pine woods dying at\nthe top, and having scorched out a good block of timber returns to steam\nand spout in caked, forgotten crevices of years before. It will break up\nsometimes blue-hot and bubbling, in the midst of a clear creek, or make\na sucking, scalding quicksand at the ford. These outbreaks had the\nkind of morbid interest for the Pocket Hunter that a house of unsavory\nreputation has in a respectable neighborhood, but I always found the\naccounts he brought me more interesting than his explanations, which\nwere compounded of fag ends of miner's talk and superstition. He was a\nperfect gossip of the woods, this Pocket Hunter, and when I could get\nhim away from \"leads\" and \"strikes\" and \"contacts,\" full of fascinating\nsmall talk about the ebb and flood of creeks, the pinon crop on Black\nMountain, and the wolves of Mesquite Valley. I suppose he never knew how\nmuch he depended for the necessary sense of home and companionship\non the beasts and trees, meeting and finding them in their wonted\nplaces,--the bear that used to come down Pine Creek in the spring,\npawing out trout from the shelters of sod banks, the juniper at Lone\nTree Spring, and the quail at Paddy Jack's.\n\nThere is a place on Waban, south of White Mountain, where flat,\nwind-tilted cedars make low tents and coves of shade and shelter, where\nthe wild sheep winter in the snow. Woodcutters and prospectors had\nbrought me word of that, but the Pocket Hunter was accessory to the\nfact. About the opening of winter, when one looks for sudden big storms,\nhe had attempted a crossing by the nearest path, beginning the ascent at\nnoon. It grew cold, the snow came on thick and blinding, and wiped\nout the trail in a white smudge; the storm drift blew in and cut off\nlandmarks, the early dark obscured the rising drifts. According to the\nPocket Hunter's account, he knew where he was, but couldn't exactly say.\nThree days before he had been in the west arm of Death Valley on a short\nwater allowance, ankle-deep in shifty sand; now he was on the rise\nof Waban, knee-deep in sodden snow, and in both cases he did the\nonly allowable thing--he walked on. That is the only thing to do in a\nsnowstorm in any case. It might have been the creature instinct, which\nin his way of life had room to grow, that led him to the cedar shelter;\nat any rate he found it about four hours after dark, and heard the\nheavy breathing of the flock. He said that if he thought at all at this\njuncture he must have thought that he had stumbled on a storm-belated\nshepherd with his silly sheep; but in fact he took no note of anything\nbut the warmth of packed fleeces, and snuggled in between them dead with\nsleep. If the flock stirred in the night he stirred drowsily to keep\nclose and let the storm go by. That was all until morning woke him\nshining on a white world. Then the very soul of him shook to see the\nwild sheep of God stand up about him, nodding their great horns beneath\nthe cedar roof, looking out on the wonder of the snow. They had moved a\nlittle away from him with the coming of the light, but paid him no more\nheed. The light broadened and the white pavilions of the snow swam in\nthe heavenly blueness of the sea from which they rose. The cloud drift\nscattered and broke billowing in the canons. The leader stamped lightly\non the litter to put the flock in motion, suddenly they took the drifts\nin those long light leaps that are nearest to flight, down and away on\nthe slopes of Waban. Think of that to happen to a Pocket Hunter! But\nthough he had fallen on many a wished-for hap, he was curiously inapt at\ngetting the truth about beasts in general. He believed in the venom of\ntoads, and charms for snake bites, and--for this I could never forgive\nhim--had all the miner's prejudices against my friend the coyote. Thief,\nsneak, and son of a thief were the friendliest words he had for this\nlittle gray dog of the wilderness.\n\nOf course with so much seeking he came occasionally upon pockets of more\nor less value, otherwise he could not have kept up his way of life; but\nhe had as much luck in missing great ledges as in finding small ones.\nHe had been all over the Tonopah country, and brought away float without\nhappening upon anything that gave promise of what that district was\nto become in a few years. He claimed to have chipped bits off the very\noutcrop of the California Rand, without finding it worth while to bring\naway, but none of these things put him out of countenance.\n\nIt was once in roving weather, when we found him shifting pack on a\nsteep trail, that I observed certain of his belongings done up in green\ncanvas bags, the veritable \"green bag\" of English novels. It seemed\nso incongruous a reminder in this untenanted West that I dropped down\nbeside the trail overlooking the vast dim valley, to hear about the\ngreen canvas. He had gotten it, he said, in London years before, and\nthat was the first I had known of his having been abroad. It was after\none of his \"big strikes\" that he had made the Grand Tour, and had\nbrought nothing away from it but the green canvas bags, which he\nconceived would fit his needs, and an ambition. This last was nothing\nless than to strike it rich and set himself up among the eminently\nbourgeois of London. It seemed that the situation of the wealthy\nEnglish middle class, with just enough gentility above to aspire to,\nand sufficient smaller fry to bully and patronize, appealed to his\nimagination, though of course he did not put it so crudely as that.\n\nIt was no news to me then, two or three years after, to learn that he\nhad taken ten thousand dollars from an abandoned claim, just the sort\nof luck to have pleased him, and gone to London to spend it. The land\nseemed not to miss him any more than it had minded him, but I missed\nhim and could not forget the trick of expecting him in least likely\nsituations. Therefore it was with a pricking sense of the familiar that\nI followed a twilight trail of smoke, a year or two later, to the swale\nof a dripping spring, and came upon a man by the fire with a coffee-pot\nand frying-pan. I was not surprised to find it was the Pocket Hunter. No\nman can be stronger than his destiny.\n\n\n\n\nSHOSHONE LAND\n\nIt is true I have been in Shoshone Land, but before that, long before,\nI had seen it through the eyes of Winnenap' in a rosy mist of\nreminiscence, and must always see it with a sense of intimacy in the\nlight that never was. Sitting on the golden slope at the campoodie,\nlooking across the Bitter Lake to the purple tops of Mutarango, the\nmedicine-man drew up its happy places one by one, like little blessed\nislands in a sea of talk. For he was born a Shoshone, was Winnenap'; and\nthough his name, his wife, his children, and his tribal relations were\nof the Paiutes, his thoughts turned homesickly toward Shoshone Land.\nOnce a Shoshone always a Shoshone. Winnenap' lived gingerly among the\nPaiutes and in his heart despised them. But he could speak a tolerable\nEnglish when he would, and he always would if it were of Shoshone Land.\n\nHe had come into the keeping of the Paiutes as a hostage for the long\npeace which the authority of the whites made interminable, and, though\nthere was now no order in the tribe, nor any power that could have\nlawfully restrained him, kept on in the old usage, to save his honor and\nthe word of his vanished kin. He had seen his children's children in\nthe borders of the Paiutes, but loved best his own miles of sand and\nrainbow-painted hills. Professedly he had not seen them since the\nbeginning of his hostage; but every year about the end of the rains\nand before the strength of the sun had come upon us from the south, the\nmedicine-man went apart on the mountains to gather herbs, and when he\ncame again I knew by the new fortitude of his countenance and the new\ncolor of his reminiscences that he had been alone and unspied upon in\nShoshone Land.\n\nTo reach that country from the campoodie, one goes south and south,\nwithin hearing of the lip-lip-lapping of the great tideless lake, and\nsouth by east over a high rolling district, miles and miles of sage and\nnothing else. So one comes to the country of the painted hills,--old red\ncones of craters, wasteful beds of mineral earths, hot, acrid springs,\nand steam jets issuing from a leprous soil. After the hills the black\nrock, after the craters the spewed lava, ash strewn, of incredible\nthickness, and full of sharp, winding rifts. There are picture writings\ncarved deep in the face of the cliffs to mark the way for those who do\nnot know it. On the very edge of the black rock the earth falls away in\na wide sweeping hollow, which is Shoshone Land.\n\nSouth the land rises in very blue hills, blue because thickly wooded\nwith ceanothus and manzanita, the haunt of deer and the border of the\nShoshones. Eastward the land goes very far by broken ranges, narrow\nvalleys of pure desertness, and huge mesas uplifted to the sky-line,\neast and east, and no man knows the end of it.\n\nIt is the country of the bighorn, the wapiti, and the wolf, nesting\nplace of buzzards, land of cloud-nourished trees and wild things that\nlive without drink. Above all, it is the land of the creosote and the\nmesquite. The mesquite is God's best thought in all this desertness. It\ngrows in the open, is thorny, stocky, close grown, and iron-rooted. Long\nwinds move in the draughty valleys, blown sand fills and fills about\nthe lower branches, piling pyramidal dunes, from the top of which the\nmesquite twigs flourish greenly. Fifteen or twenty feet under the drift,\nwhere it seems no rain could penetrate, the main trunk grows, attaining\noften a yard's thickness, resistant as oak. In Shoshone Land one digs\nfor large timber; that is in the southerly, sandy exposures. Higher on\nthe table-topped ranges low trees of juniper and pinon stand each apart,\nrounded and spreading heaps of greenness. Between them, but each to\nitself in smooth clear spaces, tufts of tall feathered grass.\n\nThis is the sense of the desert hills, that there is room enough and\ntime enough. Trees grow to consummate domes; every plant has its perfect\nwork. Noxious weeds such as come up thickly in crowded fields do not\nflourish in the free spaces. Live long enough with an Indian, and he or\nthe wild things will show you a use for everything that grows in these\nborders.\n\nThe manner of the country makes the usage of life there, and the land\nwill not be lived in except in its own fashion. The Shoshones live\nlike their trees, with great spaces between, and in pairs and in family\ngroups they set up wattled huts by the infrequent springs. More wickiups\nthan two make a very great number. Their shelters are lightly built, for\nthey travel much and far, following where deer feed and seeds ripen, but\nthey are not more lonely than other creatures that inhabit there.\n\nThe year's round is somewhat in this fashion. After the pinon harvest\nthe clans foregather on a warm southward slope for the annual adjustment\nof tribal difficulties and the medicine dance, for marriage and mourning\nand vengeance, and the exchange of serviceable information; if, for\nexample, the deer have shifted their feeding ground, if the wild sheep\nhave come back to Waban, or certain springs run full or dry. Here the\nShoshones winter flockwise, weaving baskets and hunting big game driven\ndown from the country of the deep snow. And this brief intercourse is\nall the use they have of their kind, for now there are no wars, and many\nof their ancient crafts have fallen into disuse. The solitariness of the\nlife breeds in the men, as in the plants, a certain well-roundedness\nand sufficiency to its own ends. Any Shoshone family has in itself the\nman-seed, power to multiply and replenish, potentialities for food and\nclothing and shelter, for healing and beautifying.\n\nWhen the rain is over and gone they are stirred by the instinct of those\nthat journeyed eastward from Eden, and go up each with his mate and\nyoung brood, like birds to old nesting places. The beginning of spring\nin Shoshone Land--oh the soft wonder of it!--is a mistiness as of\nincense smoke, a veil of greenness over the whitish stubby shrubs, a web\nof color on the silver sanded soil. No counting covers the multitude of\nrayed blossoms that break suddenly underfoot in the brief season of the\nwinter rains, with silky furred or prickly viscid foliage, or no foliage\nat all. They are morning and evening bloomers chiefly, and strong\nseeders. Years of scant rains they lie shut and safe in the winnowed\nsands, so that some species appear to be extinct. Years of long storms\nthey break so thickly into bloom that no horse treads without crushing\nthem. These years the gullies of the hills are rank with fern and a\ngreat tangle of climbing vines.\n\nJust as the mesa twilights have their vocal note in the love call of\nthe burrowing owl, so the desert spring is voiced by the mourning doves.\nWelcome and sweet they sound in the smoky mornings before breeding time,\nand where they frequent in any great numbers water is confidently looked\nfor. Still by the springs one finds the cunning brush shelters from\nwhich the Shoshones shot arrows at them when the doves came to drink.\n\nNow as to these same Shoshones there are some who claim that they have\nno right to the name, which belongs to a more northerly tribe; but that\nis the word they will be called by, and there is no greater offense than\nto call an Indian out of his name. According to their traditions and all\nproper evidence, they were a great people occupying far north and east\nof their present bounds, driven thence by the Paiutes. Between the two\ntribes is the residuum of old hostilities.\n\nWinnenap', whose memory ran to the time when the boundary of the Paiute\ncountry was a dead-line to Shoshones, told me once how himself and\nanother lad, in an unforgotten spring, discovered a nesting place of\nbuzzards a bit of a way beyond the borders. And they two burned to\nrob those nests. Oh, for no purpose at all except as boys rob nests\nimmemorially, for the fun of it, to have and handle and show to other\nlads as an exceeding treasure, and afterwards discard. So, not quite\nmeaning to, but breathless with daring, they crept up a gully, across\na sage brush flat and through a waste of boulders, to the rugged pines\nwhere their sharp eyes had made out the buzzards settling.\n\nThe medicine-man told me, always with a quaking relish at this point,\nthat while they, grown bold by success, were still in the tree, they\nsighted a Paiute hunting party crossing between them and their own land.\nThat was mid-morning, and all day on into the dark the boys crept and\ncrawled and slid, from boulder to bush, and bush to boulder, in cactus\nscrub and on naked sand, always in a sweat of fear, until the dust caked\nin the nostrils and the breath sobbed in the body, around and away\nmany a mile until they came to their own land again. And all the time\nWinnenap' carried those buzzard's eggs in the slack of his single\nbuckskin garment! Young Shoshones are like young quail, knowing without\nteaching about feeding and hiding, and learning what civilized children\nnever learn, to be still and to keep on being still, at the first hint\nof danger or strangeness.\n\nAs for food, that appears to be chiefly a matter of being willing.\nDesert Indians all eat chuckwallas, big black and white lizards that\nhave delicate white flesh savored like chicken. Both the Shoshones and\nthe coyotes are fond of the flesh of Gopherus agassizii, the turtle\nthat by feeding on buds, going without drink, and burrowing in the sand\nthrough the winter, contrives to live a known period of twenty-five\nyears. It seems that most seeds are foodful in the arid regions, most\nberries edible, and many shrubs good for firewood with the sap in them.\nThe mesquite bean, whether the screw or straight pod, pounded to a\nmeal, boiled to a kind of mush, and dried in cakes, sulphur-colored\nand needing an axe to cut it, is an excellent food for long journeys.\nFermented in water with wild honey and the honeycomb, it makes a\npleasant, mildly intoxicating drink.\n\nNext to spring, the best time to visit Shoshone Land is when the\ndeer-star hangs low and white like a torch over the morning hills. Go\nup past Winnedumah and down Saline and up again to the rim of Mesquite\nValley. Take no tent, but if you will, have an Indian build you a\nwickiup, willows planted in a circle, drawn over to an arch, and bound\ncunningly with withes, all the leaves on, and chinks to count the stars\nthrough. But there was never any but Winnenap' who could tell and make\nit worth telling about Shoshone Land.\n\nAnd Winnenap' will not any more. He died, as do most medicine-men of the\nPaiutes.\n\nWhere the lot falls when the campoodie chooses a medicine-man there it\nrests. It is an honor a man seldom seeks but must wear, an honor with\na condition. When three patients die under his ministrations, the\nmedicine-man must yield his life and his office.\n\nWounds do not count; broken bones and bullet holes the Indian can\nunderstand, but measles, pneumonia, and smallpox are witchcraft.\nWinnenap' was medicine-man for fifteen years. Besides considerable skill\nin healing herbs, he used his prerogatives cunningly. It is permitted\nthe medicine-man to decline the case when the patient has had treatment\nfrom any other, say the white doctor, whom many of the younger\ngeneration consult. Or, if before having seen the patient, he can\ndefinitely refer his disorder to some supernatural cause wholly out\nof the medicine-man's jurisdiction, say to the spite of an evil spirit\ngoing about in the form of a coyote, and states the case convincingly,\nhe may avoid the penalty. But this must not be pushed too far. All\nelse failing, he can hide. Winnenap' did this the time of the measles\nepidemic. Returning from his yearly herb gathering, he heard of it at\nBlack Rock, and turning aside, he was not to be found, nor did he\nreturn to his own place until the disease had spent itself, and half\nthe children of the campoodie were in their shallow graves with beads\nsprinkled over them.\n\nIt is possible the tale of Winnenap's patients had not been strictly\nkept. There had not been a medicine-man killed in the valley for twelve\nyears, and for that the perpetrators had been severely punished by the\nwhites. The winter of the Big Snow an epidemic of pneumonia carried off\nthe Indians with scarcely a warning; from the lake northward to the\nlava flats they died in the sweathouses, and under the hands of the\nmedicine-men. Even the drugs of the white physician had no power.\n\nAfter two weeks of this plague the Paiutes drew to council to consider\nthe remissness of their medicine-men. They were sore with grief\nand afraid for themselves; as a result of the council, one in every\ncampoodie was sentenced to the ancient penalty. But schooling and native\nshrewdness had raised up in the younger men an unfaith in old usages,\nso judgment halted between sentence and execution. At Three Pines the\ngovernment teacher brought out influential whites to threaten and cajole\nthe stubborn tribes. At Tunawai the conservatives sent into Nevada for\nthat pacific old humbug, Johnson Sides, most notable of Paiute orators,\nto harangue his people. Citizens of the towns turned out with food and\ncomforts, and so after a season the trouble passed.\n\nBut here at Maverick there was no school, no oratory, and no\nalleviation. One third of the campoodie died, and the rest killed the\nmedicine-men. Winnenap' expected it, and for days walked and sat a\nlittle apart from his family that he might meet it as became a Shoshone,\nno doubt suffering the agony of dread deferred. When finally three men\ncame and sat at his fire without greeting he knew his time. He turned a\nlittle from them, dropped his chin upon his knees, and looked out over\nShoshone Land, breathing evenly. The women went into the wickiup and\ncovered their heads with their blankets.\n\nSo much has the Indian lost of savageness by merely desisting from\nkilling, that the executioners braved themselves to their work\nby drinking and a show of quarrelsomeness. In the end a sharp\nhatchet-stroke discharged the duty of the campoodie. Afterward his women\nburied him, and a warm wind coming out of the south, the force of the\ndisease was broken, and even they acquiesced in the wisdom of the tribe.\nThat summer they told me all except the names of the Three.\n\nSince it appears that we make our own heaven here, no doubt we shall\nhave a hand in the heaven of hereafter; and I know what Winnenap's will\nbe like: worth going to if one has leave to live in it according to\nhis liking. It will be tawny gold underfoot, walled up with jacinth and\njasper, ribbed with chalcedony, and yet no hymnbook heaven, but the free\nair and free spaces of Shoshone Land.\n\n\n\n\nJIMVILLE\n\nA BRET HARTE TOWN\n\nWhen Mr. Harte found himself with a fresh palette and his particular\nlocal color fading from the West, he did what he considered the only\nsafe thing, and carried his young impression away to be worked out\nuntroubled by any newer fact. He should have gone to Jimville. There he\nwould have found cast up on the ore-ribbed hills the bleached timbers of\nmore tales, and better ones.\n\nYou could not think of Jimville as anything more than a survival, like\nthe herb-eating, bony-cased old tortoise that pokes cheerfully about\nthose borders some thousands of years beyond his proper epoch. Not that\nJimville is old, but it has an atmosphere favorable to the type of a\nhalf century back, if not \"forty-niners,\" of that breed. It is said\nof Jimville that getting away from it is such a piece of work that it\nencourages permanence in the population; the fact is that most have been\ndrawn there by some real likeness or liking. Not however that I would\ndeny the difficulty of getting into or out of that cove of reminder, I\nwho have made the journey so many times at great pains of a poor body.\nAny way you go at it, Jimville is about three days from anywhere in\nparticular. North or south, after the railroad there is a stage journey\nof such interminable monotony as induces forgetfulness of all previous\nstates of existence.\n\nThe road to Jimville is the happy hunting ground of old stage-coaches\nbought up from superseded routes the West over, rocking, lumbering, wide\nvehicles far gone in the odor of romance, coaches that Vasquez has held\nup, from whose high seats express messengers have shot or been shot as\ntheir luck held. This is to comfort you when the driver stops to rummage\nfor wire to mend a failing bolt. There is enough of this sort of thing\nto quite prepare you to believe what the driver insists, namely, that\nall that country and Jimville are held together by wire.\n\nFirst on the way to Jimville you cross a lonely open land, with a hint\nin the sky of things going on under the horizon, a palpitant, white, hot\nland where the wheels gird at the sand and the midday heaven shuts it in\nbreathlessly like a tent. So in still weather; and when the wind blows\nthere is occupation enough for the passengers, shifting seats to hold\ndown the windward side of the wagging coach. This is a mere trifle. The\nJimville stage is built for five passengers, but when you have seven,\nwith four trunks, several parcels, three sacks of grain, the mail and\nexpress, you begin to understand that proverb about the road which has\nbeen reported to you. In time you learn to engage the high seat beside\nthe driver, where you get good air and the best company. Beyond the\ndesert rise the lava flats, scoriae strewn; sharp-cutting walls of\nnarrow canons; league-wide, frozen puddles of black rock, intolerable\nand forbidding. Beyond the lava the mouths that spewed it out,\nragged-lipped, ruined craters shouldering to the cloud-line, mostly of\nred earth, as red as a red heifer. These have some comforting of shrubs\nand grass. You get the very spirit of the meaning of that country when\nyou see Little Pete feeding his sheep in the red, choked maw of an old\nvent,--a kind of silly pastoral gentleness that glozes over an elemental\nviolence. Beyond the craters rise worn, auriferous hills of a quiet\nsort, tumbled together; a valley full of mists; whitish green scrub; and\nbright, small, panting lizards; then Jimville.\n\nThe town looks to have spilled out of Squaw Gulch, and that, in fact,\nis the sequence of its growth. It began around the Bully Boy and Theresa\ngroup of mines midway up Squaw Gulch, spreading down to the smelter at\nthe mouth of the ravine. The freight wagons dumped their loads as near\nto the mill as the slope allowed, and Jimville grew in between. Above\nthe Gulch begins a pine wood with sparsely grown thickets of lilac,\nazalea, and odorous blossoming shrubs.\n\nSquaw Gulch is a very sharp, steep, ragged-walled ravine, and that part\nof Jimville which is built in it has only one street,--in summer paved\nwith bone-white cobbles, in the wet months a frothy yellow flood. All\nbetween the ore dumps and solitary small cabins, pieced out with tin\ncans and packing cases, run footpaths drawing down to the Silver Dollar\nsaloon. When Jimville was having the time of its life the Silver\nDollar had those same coins let into the bar top for a border, but\nthe proprietor pried them out when the glory departed. There are three\nhundred inhabitants in Jimville and four bars, though you are not to\nargue anything from that.\n\nHear now how Jimville came by its name. Jim Calkins discovered the\nBully Boy, Jim Baker located the Theresa. When Jim Jenkins opened an\neating-house in his tent he chalked up on the flap, \"Best meals in\nJimville, $1.00,\" and the name stuck.\n\nThere was more human interest in the origin of Squaw Gulch, though it\ntickled no humor. It was Dimmick's squaw from Aurora way. If Dimmick had\nbeen anything except New Englander he would have called her a mahala,\nbut that would not have bettered his behavior. Dimmick made a strike,\nwent East, and the squaw who had been to him as his wife took to drink.\nThat was the bald way of stating it in the Aurora country. The milk of\nhuman kindness, like some wine, must not be uncorked too much in speech\nlest it lose savor. This is what they did. The woman would have returned\nto her own people, being far gone with child, but the drink worked her\nbane. By the river of this ravine her pains overtook her. There Jim\nCalkins, prospecting, found her dying with a three days' babe nozzling\nat her breast. Jim heartened her for the end, buried her, and walked\nback to Poso, eighteen miles, the child poking in the folds of his\ndenim shirt with small mewing noises, and won support for it from the\nrough-handed folks of that place. Then he came back to Squaw Gulch, so\nnamed from that day, and discovered the Bully Boy. Jim humbly regarded\nthis piece of luck as interposed for his reward, and I for one believed\nhim. If it had been in mediaeval times you would have had a legend or\na ballad. Bret Harte would have given you a tale. You see in me a mere\nrecorder, for I know what is best for you; you shall blow out this\nbubble from your own breath.\n\nYou could never get into any proper relation to Jimville unless you\ncould slough off and swallow your acquired prejudices as a lizard does\nhis skin. Once wanting some womanly attentions, the stage-driver assured\nme I might have them at the Nine-Mile House from the lady barkeeper.\nThe phrase tickled all my after-dinner-coffee sense of humor into an\nanticipation of Poker Flat. The stage-driver proved himself really\nright, though you are not to suppose from this that Jimville had no\nconventions and no caste. They work out these things in the personal\nequation largely. Almost every latitude of behavior is allowed a good\nfellow, one no liar, a free spender, and a backer of his friends'\nquarrels. You are respected in as much ground as you can shoot over, in\nas many pretensions as you can make good.\n\nThat probably explains Mr. Fanshawe, the gentlemanly faro dealer of\nthose parts, built for the role of Oakhurst, going white-shirted\nand frock-coated in a community of overalls; and persuading you that\nwhatever shifts and tricks of the game were laid to his deal, he could\nnot practice them on a person of your penetration. But he does. By\nhis own account and the evidence of his manners he had been bred for a\nclergyman, and he certainly has gifts for the part. You find him always\nin possession of your point of view, and with an evident though not\nobtrusive desire to stand well with you. For an account of his killings,\nfor his way with women and the way of women with him, I refer you to\nBrown of Calaveras and some others of that stripe. His improprieties had\na certain sanction of long standing not accorded to the gay ladies who\nwore Mr. Fanshawe's favors. There were perhaps too many of them. On the\nwhole, the point of the moral distinctions of Jimville appears to be a\npoint of honor, with an absence of humorous appreciation that strangers\nmistake for dullness. At Jimville they see behavior as history and judge\nit by facts, untroubled by invention and the dramatic sense. You glimpse\na crude equity in their dealings with Wilkins, who had shot a man at\nLone Tree, fairly, in an open quarrel. Rumor of it reached Jimville\nbefore Wilkins rested there in flight. I saw Wilkins, all Jimville saw\nhim; in fact, he came into the Silver Dollar when we were holding a\nchurch fair and bought a pink silk pincushion. I have often wondered\nwhat became of it. Some of us shook hands with him, not because we did\nnot know, but because we had not been officially notified, and there\nwere those present who knew how it was themselves. When the sheriff\narrived Wilkins had moved on, and Jimville organized a posse and brought\nhim back, because the sheriff was a Jimville man and we had to stand by\nhim.\n\nI said we had the church fair at the Silver Dollar. We had most things\nthere, dances, town meetings, and the kinetoscope exhibition of the\nPassion Play. The Silver Dollar had been built when the borders of\nJimville spread from Minton to the red hill the Defiance twisted\nthrough. \"Side-Winder\" Smith scrubbed the floor for us and moved the bar\nto the back room. The fair was designed for the support of the circuit\nrider who preached to the few that would hear, and buried us all in\nturn. He was the symbol of Jimville's respectability, although he was of\na sect that held dancing among the cardinal sins. The management took\nno chances on offending the minister; at 11.30 they tendered him the\nreceipts of the evening in the chairman's hat, as a delicate intimation\nthat the fair was closed. The company filed out of the front door and\naround to the back. Then the dance began formally with no feelings\nhurt. These were the sort of courtesies, common enough in Jimville, that\nbrought tears of delicate inner laughter.\n\nThere were others besides Mr. Fanshawe who had walked out of Mr. Harte's\ndemesne to Jimville and wore names that smacked of the soil,--\"Alkali\nBill,\" \"Pike\" Wilson, \"Three Finger,\" and \"Mono Jim;\" fierce, shy,\nprofane, sun-dried derelicts of the windy hills, who each owned, or had\nowned, a mine and was wishful to own one again. They laid up on the worn\nbenches of the Silver Dollar or the Same Old Luck like beached vessels,\nand their talk ran on endlessly of \"strike\" and \"contact\" and \"mother\nlode,\" and worked around to fights and hold-ups, villainy, haunts, and\nthe hoodoo of the Minietta, told austerely without imagination.\n\nDo not suppose I am going to repeat it all; you who want these things\nwritten up from the point of view of people who do not do them every day\nwould get no savor in their speech.\n\nSays Three Finger, relating the history of the Mariposa, \"I took it\noff'n Tom Beatty, cheap, after his brother Bill was shot.\"\n\nSays Jim Jenkins, \"What was the matter of him?\"\n\n\"Who? Bill? Abe Johnson shot him; he was fooling around Johnson's wife,\nan' Tom sold me the mine dirt cheap.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he work it himself?\"\n\n\"Him? Oh, he was laying for Abe and calculated to have to leave the\ncountry pretty quick.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" says Jim Jenkins, and the tale flows smoothly on.\n\nYearly the spring fret floats the loose population of Jimville out into\nthe desolate waste hot lands, guiding by the peaks and a few rarely\ntouched water-holes, always, always with the golden hope. They develop\nprospects and grow rich, develop others and grow poor but never\nembittered. Say the hills, It is all one, there is gold enough,\ntime enough, and men enough to come after you. And at Jimville they\nunderstand the language of the hills.\n\nJimville does not know a great deal about the crust of the earth, it\nprefers a \"hunch.\" That is an intimation from the gods that if you go\nover a brown back of the hills, by a dripping spring, up Coso way, you\nwill find what is worth while. I have never heard that the failure of\nany particular hunch disproved the principle. Somehow the rawness of the\nland favors the sense of personal relation to the supernatural. There is\nnot much intervention of crops, cities, clothes, and manners between you\nand the organizing forces to cut off communication. All this begets\nin Jimville a state that passes explanation unless you will accept an\nexplanation that passes belief. Along with killing and drunkenness,\ncoveting of women, charity, simplicity, there is a certain indifference,\nblankness, emptiness if you will, of all vaporings, no bubbling of the\npot,--it wants the German to coin a word for that,--no bread-envy, no\nbrother-fervor. Western writers have not sensed it yet; they smack the\nsavor of lawlessness too much upon their tongues, but you have these\nto witness it is not mean-spiritedness. It is pure Greek in that it\nrepresents the courage to sheer off what is not worth while. Beyond\nthat it endures without sniveling, renounces without self-pity, fears no\ndeath, rates itself not too great in the scheme of things; so do beasts,\nso did St. Jerome in the desert, so also in the elder day did gods.\nLife, its performance, cessation, is no new thing to gape and wonder at.\n\nHere you have the repose of the perfectly accepted instinct which\nincludes passion and death in its perquisites. I suppose that the end of\nall our hammering and yawping will be something like the point of view\nof Jimville. The only difference will be in the decorations.\n\n\n\n\nMY NEIGHBOR'S FIELD\n\nIt is one of those places God must have meant for a field from all\ntime, lying very level at the foot of the slope that crowds up against\nKearsarge, falling slightly toward the town. North and south it is\nfenced by low old glacial ridges, boulder strewn and untenable. Eastward\nit butts on orchard closes and the village gardens, brimming over into\nthem by wild brier and creeping grass. The village street, with its\ndouble row of unlike houses, breaks off abruptly at the edge of the\nfield in a footpath that goes up the streamside, beyond it, to the\nsource of waters.\n\nThe field is not greatly esteemed of the town, not being put to the\nplough nor affording firewood, but breeding all manner of wild seeds\nthat go down in the irrigating ditches to come up as weeds in the\ngardens and grass plots. But when I had no more than seen it in the\ncharm of its spring smiling, I knew I should have no peace until I had\nbought ground and built me a house beside it, with a little wicket to go\nin and out at all hours, as afterward came about.\n\nEdswick, Roeder, Connor, and Ruffin owned the field before it fell to my\nneighbor. But before that the Paiutes, mesne lords of the soil, made a\ncampoodie by the rill of Pine Creek; and after, contesting the soil\nwith them, cattle-men, who found its foodful pastures greatly to their\nadvantage; and bands of blethering flocks shepherded by wild, hairy men\nof little speech, who attested their rights to the feeding ground with\ntheir long staves upon each other's skulls. Edswick homesteaded the\nfield about the time the wild tide of mining life was roaring and\nrioting up Kearsarge, and where the village now stands built a stone\nhut, with loopholes to make good his claim against cattlemen or Indians.\nBut Edswick died and Roeder became master of the field. Roeder owned\ncattle on a thousand hills, and made it a recruiting ground for his\nbellowing herds before beginning the long drive to market across a\nshifty desert. He kept the field fifteen years, and afterward falling\ninto difficulties, put it out as security against certain sums. Connor,\nwho held the securities, was cleverer than Roeder and not so busy. The\nmoney fell due the winter of the Big Snow, when all the trails were\nforty feet under drifts, and Roeder was away in San Francisco selling\nhis cattle. At the set time Connor took the law by the forelock and was\nadjudged possession of the field. Eighteen days later Roeder arrived on\nsnowshoes, both feet frozen, and the money in his pack. In the long suit\nat law ensuing, the field fell to Ruffin, that clever one-armed lawyer\nwith the tongue to wile a bird out of the bush, Connor's counsel, and\nwas sold by him to my neighbor, whom from envying his possession I call\nNaboth.\n\nCuriously, all this human occupancy of greed and mischief left no mark\non the field, but the Indians did, and the unthinking sheep. Round its\ncorners children pick up chipped arrow points of obsidian, scattered\nthrough it are kitchen middens and pits of old sweat-houses. By the\nsouth corner, where the campoodie stood, is a single shrub of \"hoopee\"\n(Lycium andersonii), maintaining itself hardly among alien shrubs, and\nnear by, three low rakish trees of hackberry, so far from home that no\nprying of mine has been able to find another in any canon east or west.\nBut the berries of both were food for the Paiutes, eagerly sought and\ntraded for as far south as Shoshone Land. By the fork of the creek where\nthe shepherds camp is a single clump of mesquite of the variety called\n\"screw bean.\" The seed must have shaken there from some sheep's coat,\nfor this is not the habitat of mesquite, and except for other single\nshrubs at sheep camps, none grows freely for a hundred and fifty miles\nsouth or east.\n\nNaboth has put a fence about the best of the field, but neither the\nIndians nor the shepherds can quite forego it. They make camp and build\ntheir wattled huts about the borders of it, and no doubt they have some\nsense of home in its familiar aspect.\n\nAs I have said, it is a low-lying field, between the mesa and the town,\nwith no hillocks in it, but a gentle swale where the waste water of the\ncreek goes down to certain farms, and the hackberry-trees, of which the\ntallest might be three times the height of a man, are the tallest things\nin it. A mile up from the water gate that turns the creek into supply\npipes for the town, begins a row of long-leaved pines, threading the\nwatercourse to the foot of Kearsarge. These are the pines that puzzle\nthe local botanist, not easily determined, and unrelated to other\nconifers of the Sierra slope; the same pines of which the Indians relate\na legend mixed of brotherliness and the retribution of God. Once\nthe pines possessed the field, as the worn stumps of them along the\nstreamside show, and it would seem their secret purpose to regain their\nold footing. Now and then some seedling escapes the devastating sheep a\nrod or two down-stream. Since I came to live by the field one of these\nhas tiptoed above the gully of the creek, beckoning the procession\nfrom the hills, as if in fact they would make back toward that\nskyward-pointing finger of granite on the opposite range, from which,\naccording to the legend, when they were bad Indians and it a great\nchief, they ran away. This year the summer floods brought the round,\nbrown, fruitful cones to my very door, and I look, if I live long\nenough, to see them come up greenly in my neighbor's field.\n\nIt is interesting to watch this retaking of old ground by the wild\nplants, banished by human use. Since Naboth drew his fence about the\nfield and restricted it to a few wild-eyed steers, halting between the\nhills and the shambles, many old habitues of the field have come back\nto their haunts. The willow and brown birch, long ago cut off by the\nIndians for wattles, have come back to the streamside, slender and\nvirginal in their spring greenness, and leaving long stretches of the\nbrown water open to the sky. In stony places where no grass grows,\nwild olives sprawl; close-twigged, blue-gray patches in winter, more\ntranslucent greenish gold in spring than any aureole. Along with willow\nand birch and brier, the clematis, that shyest plant of water borders,\nslips down season by season to within a hundred yards of the village\nstreet. Convinced after three years that it would come no nearer, we\nspent time fruitlessly pulling up roots to plant in the garden. All this\nwhile, when no coaxing or care prevailed upon any transplanted slip\nto grow, one was coming up silently outside the fence near the wicket,\ncoiling so secretly in the rabbit-brush that its presence was never\nsuspected until it flowered delicately along its twining length. The\nhorehound comes through the fence and under it, shouldering the pickets\noff the railings; the brier rose mines under the horehound; and no care,\nthough I own I am not a close weeder, keeps the small pale moons of the\nprimrose from rising to the night moth under my apple-trees. The\nfirst summer in the new place, a clump of cypripediums came up by the\nirrigating ditch at the bottom of the lawn. But the clematis will not\ncome inside, nor the wild almond.\n\nI have forgotten to find out, though I meant to, whether the wild almond\ngrew in that country where Moses kept the flocks of his father-in-law,\nbut if so one can account for the burning bush. It comes upon one with\na flame-burst as of revelation; little hard red buds on leafless twigs,\nswelling unnoticeably, then one, two, or three strong suns, and from tip\nto tip one soft fiery glow, whispering with bees as a singing flame. A\ntwig of finger size will be furred to the thickness of one's wrist by\npink five-petaled bloom, so close that only the blunt-faced wild bees\nfind their way in it. In this latitude late frosts cut off the hope of\nfruit too often for the wild almond to multiply greatly, but the spiny,\ntap-rooted shrubs are resistant to most plant evils.\n\nIt is not easy always to be attentive to the maturing of wild fruit.\nPlants are so unobtrusive in their material processes, and always at the\nsignificant moment some other bloom has reached its perfect hour. One\ncan never fix the precise moment when the rosy tint the field has from\nthe wild almond passes into the inspiring blue of lupines. One notices\nhere and there a spike of bloom, and a day later the whole field royal\nand ruffling lightly to the wind. Part of the charm of the lupine is the\ncontinual stir of its plumes to airs not suspected otherwhere. Go and\nstand by any crown of bloom and the tall stalks do but rock a little as\nfor drowsiness, but look off across the field, and on the stillest days\nthere is always a trepidation in the purple patches.\n\nFrom midsummer until frost the prevailing note of the field is clear\ngold, passing into the rusty tone of bigelovia going into a decline,\na succession of color schemes more admirably managed than the\ntransformation scene at the theatre. Under my window a colony of cleome\nmade a soft web of bloom that drew me every morning for a long still\ntime; and one day I discovered that I was looking into a rare fretwork\nof fawn and straw colored twigs from which both bloom and leaf had gone,\nand I could not say if it had been for a matter of weeks or days. The\ntime to plant cucumbers and set out cabbages may be set down in the\nalmanac, but never seed-time nor blossom in Naboth's field.\n\nCertain winged and mailed denizens of the field seem to reach their\nheyday along with the plants they most affect. In June the leaning\ntowers of the white milkweed are jeweled over with red and gold beetles,\nclimbing dizzily. This is that milkweed from whose stems the Indians\nflayed fibre to make snares for small game, but what use the beetles put\nit to except for a displaying ground for their gay coats, I could never\ndiscover. The white butterfly crop comes on with the bigelovia bloom,\nand on warm mornings makes an airy twinkling all across the field. In\nSeptember young linnets grow out of the rabbit-brush in the night. All\nthe nests discoverable in the neighboring orchards will not account for\nthe numbers of them. Somewhere, by the same secret process by which\nthe field matures a million more seeds than it needs, it is maturing\nred-hooded linnets for their devouring. All the purlieus of bigelovia\nand artemisia are noisy with them for a month. Suddenly as they come as\nsuddenly go the fly-by-nights, that pitch and toss on dusky barred wings\nabove the field of summer twilights.\n\nNever one of these nighthawks will you see after linnet time, though the\nhurtle of their wings makes a pleasant sound across the dusk in their\nseason.\n\nFor two summers a great red-tailed hawk has visited the field every\nafternoon between three and four o'clock, swooping and soaring with\nthe airs of a gentleman adventurer. What he finds there is chiefly\nconjectured, so secretive are the little people of Naboth's field. Only\nwhen leaves fall and the light is low and slant, one sees the long\nclean flanks of the jackrabbits, leaping like small deer, and of late\nafternoons little cotton-tails scamper in the runways. But the most one\nsees of the burrowers, gophers, and mice is the fresh earthwork of their\nnewly opened doors, or the pitiful small shreds the butcher-bird hangs\non spiny shrubs.\n\nIt is a still field, this of my neighbor's, though so busy, and\nadmirably compounded for variety and pleasantness,--a little sand, a\nlittle loam, a grassy plot, a stony rise or two, a full brown stream, a\nlittle touch of humanness, a footpath trodden out by moccasins. Naboth\nexpects to make town lots of it and his fortune in one and the same day;\nbut when I take the trail to talk with old Seyavi at the campoodie, it\noccurs to me that though the field may serve a good turn in those days\nit will hardly be happier. No, certainly not happier.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MESA TRAIL\n\nThe mesa trail begins in the campoodie at the corner of Naboth's field,\nthough one may drop into it from the wood road toward the canon, or from\nany of the cattle paths that go up along the streamside; a clean, pale,\nsmooth-trodden way between spiny shrubs, comfortably wide for a horse\nor an Indian. It begins, I say, at the campoodie, and goes on toward the\ntwilight hills and the borders of Shoshone Land. It strikes diagonally\nacross the foot of the hill-slope from the field until it reaches the\nlarkspur level, and holds south along the front of Oppapago, having the\nhigh ranges to the right and the foothills and the great Bitter Lake\nbelow it on the left. The mesa holds very level here, cut across at\nintervals by the deep washes of dwindling streams, and its treeless\nspaces uncramp the soul.\n\nMesa trails were meant to be traveled on horseback, at the jigging\ncoyote trot that only western-bred horses learn successfully. A\nfoot-pace carries one too slowly past the units in a decorative scheme\nthat is on a scale with the country round for bigness. It takes days'\njourneys to give a note of variety to the country of the social\nshrubs. These chiefly clothe the benches and eastern foot-slopes of the\nSierras,--great spreads of artemisia, coleogyne, and spinosa, suffering\nno other woody stemmed thing in their purlieus; this by election\napparently, with no elbowing; and the several shrubs have each their\nclientele of flowering herbs. It would be worth knowing how much the\ndevastating sheep have had to do with driving the tender plants to the\nshelter of the prickle-bushes. It might have begun earlier, in the time\nSeyavi of the campoodie tells of, when antelope ran on the mesa like\nsheep for numbers, but scarcely any foot-high herb rears itself except\nfrom the midst of some stout twigged shrub; larkspur in the coleogyne,\nand for every spinosa the purpling coils of phacelia. In the shrub\nshelter, in the season, flock the little stemless things whose blossom\ntime is as short as a marriage song. The larkspurs make the best\nshowing, being tall and sweet, swaying a little above the shrubbery,\nscattering pollen dust which Navajo brides gather to fill their marriage\nbaskets. This were an easier task than to find two of them of a shade.\nLarkspurs in the botany are blue, but if you were to slip rein to the\nstub of some black sage and set about proving it you would be still\nat it by the hour when the white gilias set their pale disks to the\nwestering sun. This is the gilia the children call \"evening snow,\" and\nit is no use trying to improve on children's names for wild flowers.\n\nFrom the height of a horse you look down to clean spaces in a shifty\nyellow soil, bare to the eye as a newly sanded floor. Then as soon as\never the hill shadows begin to swell out from the sidelong ranges, come\nlittle flakes of whiteness fluttering at the edge of the sand. By dusk\nthere are tiny drifts in the lee of every strong shrub, rosy-tipped\ncorollas as riotous in the sliding mesa wind as if they were real flakes\nshaken out of a cloud, not sprung from the ground on wiry three-inch\nstems. They keep awake all night, and all the air is heavy and musky\nsweet because of them.\n\nFarther south on the trail there will be poppies meeting ankle deep, and\nsingly, peacock-painted bubbles of calochortus blown out at the tops of\ntall stems. But before the season is in tune for the gayer blossoms the\nbest display of color is in the lupin wash. There is always a lupin wash\nsomewhere on the mesa trail,--a broad, shallow, cobble-paved sink of\nvanished waters, where the hummocks of Lupinus ornatus run a delicate\ngamut from silvery green of spring to silvery white of winter foliage.\nThey look in fullest leaf, except for color, most like the huddled huts\nof the campoodie, and the largest of them might be a man's length in\ndiameter. In their season, which is after the gilias are at their best,\nand before the larkspurs are ripe for pollen gathering, every terminal\nwhorl of the lupin sends up its blossom stalk, not holding any constant\nblue, but paling and purpling to guide the friendly bee to virginal\nhoney sips, or away from the perfected and depleted flower. The length\nof the blossom stalk conforms to the rounded contour of the plant,\nand of these there will be a million moving indescribably in the airy\ncurrent that flows down the swale of the wash.\n\nThere is always a little wind on the mesa, a sliding current of cooler\nair going down the face of the mountain of its own momentum, but not to\ndisturb the silence of great space. Passing the wide mouths of canons,\none gets the effect of whatever is doing in them, openly or behind a\nscreen of cloud,--thunder of falls, wind in the pine leaves, or rush\nand roar of rain. The rumor of tumult grows and dies in passing, as\nfrom open doors gaping on a village street, but does not impinge on the\neffect of solitariness.\n\nIn quiet weather mesa days have no parallel for stillness, but the night\nsilence breaks into certain mellow or poignant notes. Late afternoons\nthe burrowing owls may be seen blinking at the doors of their hummocks\nwith perhaps four or five elfish nestlings arow, and by twilight begin a\nsoft whoo-oo-ing, rounder, sweeter, more incessant in mating time. It is\nnot possible to disassociate the call of the burrowing owl from the\nlate slant light of the mesa. If the fine vibrations which are the\ngolden-violet glow of spring twilights were to tremble into sound, it\nwould be just that mellow double note breaking along the blossom-tops.\nWhile the glow holds one sees the thistle-down flights and pouncings\nafter prey, and on into the dark hears their soft pus-ssh! clearing out\nof the trail ahead. Maybe the pinpoint shriek of field mouse or kangaroo\nrat that pricks the wakeful pauses of the night is extorted by these\nmellow-voiced plunderers, though it is just as like to be the work of\nthe red fox on his twenty-mile constitutional.\n\nBoth the red fox and the coyote are free of the night hours, and both\nkillers for the pure love of slaughter. The fox is no great talker, but\nthe coyote goes garrulously through the dark in twenty keys at once,\ngossip, warning, and abuse. They are light treaders, the split-feet,\nso that the solitary camper sees their eyes about him in the dark\nsometimes, and hears the soft intake of breath when no leaf has stirred\nand no twig snapped underfoot. The coyote is your real lord of the mesa,\nand so he makes sure you are armed with no long black instrument to\nspit your teeth into his vitals at a thousand yards, is both bold\nand curious. Not so bold, however, as the badger and not so much of a\ncurmudgeon. This short-legged meat-eater loves half lights and lowering\ndays, has no friends, no enemies, and disowns his offspring. Very likely\nif he knew how hawk and crow dog him for dinners, he would resent it.\nBut the badger is not very well contrived for looking up or far to\neither side. Dull afternoons he may be met nosing a trail hot-foot to\nthe home of ground rat or squirrel, and is with difficulty persuaded to\ngive the right of way. The badger is a pot-hunter and no sportsman. Once\nat the hill, he dives for the central chamber, his sharp-clawed, splayey\nfeet splashing up the sand like a bather in the surf. He is a swift\ntrailer, but not so swift or secretive but some small sailing hawk\nor lazy crow, perhaps one or two of each, has spied upon him and come\ndrifting down the wind to the killing.\n\nNo burrower is so unwise as not to have several exits from his dwelling\nunder protecting shrubs. When the badger goes down, as many of the furry\npeople as are not caught napping come up by the back doors, and the\nhawks make short work of them. I suspect that the crows get nothing but\nthe gratification of curiosity and the pickings of some secret store\nof seeds unearthed by the badger. Once the excavation begins they walk\nabout expectantly, but the little gray hawks beat slow circles about\nthe doors of exit, and are wiser in their generation, though they do not\nlook it.\n\nThere are always solitary hawks sailing above the mesa, and where some\nblue tower of silence lifts out of the neighboring range, an eagle\nhanging dizzily, and always buzzards high up in the thin, translucent\nair making a merry-go-round. Between the coyote and the birds of carrion\nthe mesa is kept clear of miserable dead.\n\nThe wind, too, is a besom over the treeless spaces, whisking new sand\nover the litter of the scant-leaved shrubs, and the little doorways\nof the burrowers are as trim as city fronts. It takes man to leave\nunsightly scars on the face of the earth. Here on the mesa the abandoned\ncampoodies of the Paiutes are spots of desolation long after the wattles\nof the huts have warped in the brush heaps. The campoodies are near the\nwatercourses, but never in the swale of the stream. The Paiute seeks\nrising ground, depending on air and sun for purification of his\ndwelling, and when it becomes wholly untenable, moves.\n\nA campoodie at noontime, when there is no smoke rising and no stir of\nlife, resembles nothing so much as a collection of prodigious wasps'\nnests. The huts are squat and brown and chimneyless, facing east, and\nthe inhabitants have the faculty of quail for making themselves scarce\nin the underbrush at the approach of strangers. But they are really not\noften at home during midday, only the blind and incompetent left to keep\nthe camp. These are working hours, and all across the mesa one sees\nthe women whisking seeds of chia into their spoon-shaped baskets, these\nemptied again into the huge conical carriers, supported on the shoulders\nby a leather band about the forehead.\n\nMornings and late afternoons one meets the men singly and afoot on\nunguessable errands, or riding shaggy, browbeaten ponies, with game\nslung across the saddle-bows. This might be deer or even antelope,\nrabbits, or, very far south towards Shoshone Land, lizards.\n\nThere are myriads of lizards on the mesa, little gray darts, or larger\nsalmon-sided ones that may be found swallowing their skins in the safety\nof a prickle-bush in early spring. Now and then a palm's breadth of\nthe trail gathers itself together and scurries off with a little\nrustle under the brush, to resolve itself into sand again. This is pure\nwitchcraft. If you succeed in catching it in transit, it loses its\npower and becomes a flat, horned, toad-like creature, horrid-looking and\nharmless, of the color of the soil; and the curio dealer will give you\ntwo bits for it, to stuff. Men have their season on the mesa as much as\nplants and four-footed things, and one is not like to meet them out of\ntheir time. For example, at the time of rodeos, which is perhaps April,\none meets free riding vaqueros who need no trails and can find cattle\nwhere to the layman no cattle exist. As early as February bands of sheep\nwork up from the south to the high Sierra pastures. It appears that\nshepherds have not changed more than sheep in the process of time. The\nshy hairy men who herd the tractile flocks might be, except for some\nadded clothing, the very brethren of David. Of necessity they are hardy,\nsimple livers, superstitious, fearful, given to seeing visions, and\nalmost without speech. It needs the bustle of shearings and copious\nlibations of sour, weak wine to restore the human faculty. Petite Pete,\nwho works a circuit up from the Ceriso to Red Butte and around by way of\nSalt Flats, passes year by year on the mesa trail, his thick hairy chest\nthrown open to all weathers, twirling his long staff, and dealing\nbrotherly with his dogs, who are possibly as intelligent, certainly\nhandsomer.\n\nA flock's journey is seven miles, ten if pasture fails, in a windless\nblur of dust, feeding as it goes, and resting at noons. Such hours Pete\nweaves a little screen of twigs between his head and the sun--the rest\nof him is as impervious as one of his own sheep--and sleeps while his\ndogs have the flocks upon their consciences. At night, wherever he may\nbe, there Pete camps, and fortunate the trail-weary traveler who falls\nin with him. When the fire kindles and savory meat seethes in the pot,\nwhen there is a drowsy blether from the flock, and far down the mesa\nthe twilight twinkle of shepherd fires, when there is a hint of blossom\nunderfoot and a heavenly whiteness on the hills, one harks back without\neffort to Judaea and the Nativity. But one feels by day anything but\ngood will to note the shorn shrubs and cropped blossom-tops. So many\nseasons' effort, so many suns and rains to make a pound of wool! And\nthen there is the loss of ground-inhabiting birds that must fail from\nthe mesa when few herbs ripen seed.\n\nOut West, the west of the mesas and the unpatented hills, there is more\nsky than any place in the world. It does not sit flatly on the rim\nof earth, but begins somewhere out in the space in which the earth is\npoised, hollows more, and is full of clean winey winds. There are some\nodors, too, that get into the blood. There is the spring smell of sage\nthat is the warning that sap is beginning to work in a soil that looks\nto have none of the juices of life in it; it is the sort of smell that\nsets one thinking what a long furrow the plough would turn up here,\nthe sort of smell that is the beginning of new leafage, is best at the\nplant's best, and leaves a pungent trail where wild cattle crop. There\nis the smell of sage at sundown, burning sage from campoodies and sheep\ncamps, that travels on the thin blue wraiths of smoke; the kind of smell\nthat gets into the hair and garments, is not much liked except upon long\nacquaintance, and every Paiute and shepherd smells of it indubitably.\nThere is the palpable smell of the bitter dust that comes up from the\nalkali flats at the end of the dry seasons, and the smell of rain from\nthe wide-mouthed canons. And last the smell of the salt grass country,\nwhich is the beginning of other things that are the end of the mesa\ntrail.\n\n\n\n\nTHE BASKET MAKER\n\n\"A man,\" says Seyavi of the campoodie, \"must have a woman, but a woman\nwho has a child will do very well.\"\n\nThat was perhaps why, when she lost her mate in the dying struggle of\nhis race, she never took another, but set her wit to fend for herself\nand her young son. No doubt she was often put to it in the beginning to\nfind food for them both. The Paiutes had made their last stand at the\nborder of the Bitter Lake; battle-driven they died in its waters, and\nthe land filled with cattle-men and adventurers for gold: this while\nSeyavi and the boy lay up in the caverns of the Black Rock and ate tule\nroots and fresh-water clams that they dug out of the slough bottoms with\ntheir toes. In the interim, while the tribes swallowed their defeat, and\nbefore the rumor of war died out, they must have come very near to the\nbare core of things. That was the time Seyavi learned the sufficiency of\nmother wit, and how much more easily one can do without a man than might\nat first be supposed.\n\nTo understand the fashion of any life, one must know the land it is\nlived in and the procession of the year. This valley is a narrow one, a\nmere trough between hills, a draught for storms, hardly a crow's flight\nfrom the sharp Sierras of the Snows to the curled, red and ochre,\nuncomforted, bare ribs of Waban. Midway of the groove runs a burrowing,\ndull river, nearly a hundred miles from where it cuts the lava flats\nof the north to its widening in a thick, tideless pool of a lake.\nHereabouts the ranges have no foothills, but rise up steeply from the\nbench lands above the river. Down from the Sierras, for the east ranges\nhave almost no rain, pour glancing white floods toward the lowest land,\nand all beside them lie the campoodies, brown wattled brush heaps,\nlooking east.\n\nIn the river are mussels, and reeds that have edible white roots, and in\nthe soddy meadows tubers of joint grass; all these at their best in the\nspring. On the slope the summer growth affords seeds; up the steep the\none-leafed pines, an oily nut. That was really all they could depend\nupon, and that only at the mercy of the little gods of frost and rain.\nFor the rest it was cunning against cunning, caution against skill,\nagainst quacking hordes of wild-fowl in the tulares, against pronghorn\nand bighorn and deer. You can guess, however, that all this warring of\nrifles and bowstrings, this influx of overlording whites, had made game\nwilder and hunters fearful of being hunted. You can surmise also, for it\nwas a crude time and the land was raw, that the women became in turn the\ngame of the conquerors.\n\nThere used to be in the Little Antelope a she dog, stray or outcast,\nthat had a litter in some forsaken lair, and ranged and foraged for\nthem, slinking savage and afraid, remembering and mistrusting humankind,\nwistful, lean, and sufficient for her young.\n\nI have thought Seyavi might have had days like that, and have had\nperfect leave to think, since she will not talk of it. Paiutes have\nthe art of reducing life to its lowest ebb and yet saving it alive on\ngrasshoppers, lizards, and strange herbs; and that time must have left\nno shift untried. It lasted long enough for Seyavi to have evolved the\nphilosophy of life which I have set down at the beginning. She had\ngone beyond learning to do for her son, and learned to believe it worth\nwhile.\n\nIn our kind of society, when a woman ceases to alter the fashion of her\nhair, you guess that she has passed the crisis of her experience. If she\ngoes on crimping and uncrimping with the changing mode, it is safe to\nsuppose she has never come up against anything too big for her. The\nIndian woman gets nearly the same personal note in the pattern of her\nbaskets. Not that she does not make all kinds, carriers, water-bottles,\nand cradles,--these are kitchen ware,--but her works of art are all of\nthe same piece. Seyavi made flaring, flat-bottomed bowls, cooking pots\nreally, when cooking was done by dropping hot stones into water-tight\nfood baskets, and for decoration a design in colored bark of the\nprocession of plumed crests of the valley quail. In this pattern she\nhad made cooking pots in the golden spring of her wedding year, when\nthe quail went up two and two to their resting places about the foot\nof Oppapago. In this fashion she made them when, after pillage, it was\npossible to reinstate the housewifely crafts. Quail ran then in the\nBlack Rock by hundreds,--so you will still find them in fortunate\nyears,--and in the famine time the women cut their long hair to make\nsnares when the flocks came morning and evening to the springs.\n\nSeyavi made baskets for love and sold them for money, in a generation\nthat preferred iron pots for utility. Every Indian woman is an\nartist,--sees, feels, creates, but does not philosophize about her\nprocesses. Seyavi's bowls are wonders of technical precision, inside and\nout, the palm finds no fault with them, but the subtlest appeal is in\nthe sense that warns us of humanness in the way the design spreads into\nthe flare of the bowl.\n\nThere used to be an Indian woman at Olancha who made bottle-neck trinket\nbaskets in the rattlesnake pattern, and could accommodate the design\nto the swelling bowl and flat shoulder of the basket without sensible\ndisproportion, and so cleverly that you might own one a year without\nthinking how it was done; but Seyavi's baskets had a touch beyond\ncleverness. The weaver and the warp lived next to the earth and were\nsaturated with the same elements. Twice a year, in the time of white\nbutterflies and again when young quail ran neck and neck in the\nchaparral, Seyavi cut willows for basketry by the creek where it wound\ntoward the river against the sun and sucking winds. It never quite\nreached the river except in far-between times of summer flood, but it\nalways tried, and the willows encouraged it as much as they could. You\nnearly always found them a little farther down than the trickle of eager\nwater. The Paiute fashion of counting time appeals to me more than any\nother calendar. They have no stamp of heathen gods nor great ones, nor\nany succession of moons as have red men of the East and North, but count\nforward and back by the progress of the season; the time of taboose,\nbefore the trout begin to leap, the end of the pinon harvest, about the\nbeginning of deep snows. So they get nearer the sense of the season,\nwhich runs early or late according as the rains are forward or delayed.\nBut whenever Seyavi cut willows for baskets was always a golden time,\nand the soul of the weather went into the wood. If you had ever owned\none of Seyavi's golden russet cooking bowls with the pattern of plumed\nquail, you would understand all this without saying anything.\n\nBefore Seyavi made baskets for the satisfaction of desire,--for that is\na house-bred theory of art that makes anything more of it,--she danced\nand dressed her hair. In those days, when the spring was at flood and\nthe blood pricked to the mating fever, the maids chose their flowers,\nwreathed themselves, and danced in the twilights, young desire crying\nout to young desire. They sang what the heart prompted, what the flower\nexpressed, what boded in the mating weather.\n\n\"And what flower did you wear, Seyavi?\"\n\n\"I, ah,--the white flower of twining (clematis), on my body and my hair,\nand so I sang:--\n\n     \"I am the white flower of twining,\n     Little white flower by the river,\n     Oh, flower that twines close by the river;\n     Oh, trembling flower!\n     So trembles the maiden heart.\"\n\nSo sang Seyavi of the campoodie before she made baskets, and in her\nlater days laid her arms upon her knees and laughed in them at the\nrecollection. But it was not often she would say so much, never\nunderstanding the keen hunger I had for bits of lore and the \"fool talk\"\nof her people. She had fed her young son with meadowlarks' tongues,\nto make him quick of speech; but in late years was loath to admit it,\nthough she had come through the period of unfaith in the lore of the\nclan with a fine appreciation of its beauty and significance.\n\n\"What good will your dead get, Seyavi, of the baskets you burn?\" said I,\ncoveting them for my own collection.\n\nThus Seyavi, \"As much good as yours of the flowers you strew.\"\n\nOppapago looks on Waban, and Waban on Coso and the Bitter Lake, and the\ncampoodie looks on these three; and more, it sees the beginning of winds\nalong the foot of Coso, the gathering of clouds behind the high ridges,\nthe spring flush, the soft spread of wild almond bloom on the mesa.\nThese first, you understand, are the Paiute's walls, the other his\nfurnishings. Not the wattled hut is his home, but the land, the winds,\nthe hill front, the stream. These he cannot duplicate at any furbisher's\nshop as you who live within doors, who, if your purse allows, may have\nthe same home at Sitka and Samarcand. So you see how it is that the\nhomesickness of an Indian is often unto death, since he gets no relief\nfrom it; neither wind nor weed nor sky-line, nor any aspect of the\nhills of a strange land sufficiently like his own. So it was when the\ngovernment reached out for the Paiutes, they gathered into the Northern\nReservation only such poor tribes as could devise no other end of their\naffairs. Here, all along the river, and south to Shoshone Land, live\nthe clans who owned the earth, fallen into the deplorable condition of\nhangers-on. Yet you hear them laughing at the hour when they draw in to\nthe campoodie after labor, when there is a smell of meat and the steam\nof the cooking pots goes up against the sun. Then the children lie with\ntheir toes in the ashes to hear tales; then they are merry, and have the\njoys of repletion and the nearness of their kind. They have their hills,\nand though jostled are sufficiently free to get some fortitude for what\nwill come. For now you shall hear of the end of the basket maker.\n\nIn her best days Seyavi was most like Deborah, deep bosomed, broad in\nthe hips, quick in counsel, slow of speech, esteemed of her people. This\nwas that Seyavi who reared a man by her own hand, her own wit, and none\nother. When the townspeople began to take note of her--and it was some\nyears after the war before there began to be any towns--she was then in\nthe quick maturity of primitive women; but when I knew her she seemed\nalready old. Indian women do not often live to great age, though they\nlook incredibly steeped in years. They have the wit to win sustenance\nfrom the raw material of life without intervention, but they have not\nthe sleek look of the women whom the social organization conspires to\nnourish. Seyavi had somehow squeezed out of her daily round a spiritual\nichor that kept the skill in her knotted fingers along after the\naccustomed time, but that also failed. By all counts she would have been\nabout sixty years old when it came her turn to sit in the dust on the\nsunny side of the wickiup, with little strength left for anything but\nlooking. And in time she paid the toll of the smoky huts and became\nblind. This is a thing so long expected by the Paiutes that when it\ncomes they find it neither bitter nor sweet, but tolerable because\ncommon. There were three other blind women in the campoodie, withered\nfruit on a bough, but they had memory and speech. By noon of the sun\nthere were never any left in the campoodie but these or some mother of\nweanlings, and they sat to keep the ashes warm upon the hearth. If it\nwere cold, they burrowed in the blankets of the hut; if it were warm,\nthey followed the shadow of the wickiup around. Stir much out of their\nplaces they hardly dared, since one might not help another; but they\ncalled, in high, old cracked voices, gossip and reminder across the ash\nheaps.\n\nThen, if they have your speech or you theirs, and have an hour to spare,\nthere are things to be learned of life not set down in any books,\nfolk tales, famine tales, love and long-suffering and desire, but no\nwhimpering. Now and then one or another of the blind keepers of the camp\nwill come across to where you sit gossiping, tapping her way among the\nkitchen middens, guided by your voice that carries far in the clearness\nand stillness of mesa afternoons. But suppose you find Seyavi retired\ninto the privacy of her blanket, you will get nothing for that day.\nThere is no other privacy possible in a campoodie. All the processes of\nlife are carried on out of doors or behind the thin, twig-woven walls\nof the wickiup, and laughter is the only corrective for behavior. Very\nearly the Indian learns to possess his countenance in impassivity, to\ncover his head with his blanket. Something to wrap around him is as\nnecessary to the Paiute as to you your closet to pray in.\n\nSo in her blanket Seyavi, sometime basket maker, sits by the unlit\nhearths of her tribe and digests her life, nourishing her spirit against\nthe time of the spirit's need, for she knows in fact quite as much of\nthese matters as you who have a larger hope, though she has none but the\ncertainty that having borne herself courageously to this end she will\nnot be reborn a coyote.\n\n\n\n\nTHE STREETS OF THE MOUNTAINS\n\nAll streets of the mountains lead to the citadel; steep or slow they go\nup to the core of the hills. Any trail that goes otherwhere must dip and\ncross, sidle and take chances. Rifts of the hills open into each other,\nand the high meadows are often wide enough to be called valleys by\ncourtesy; but one keeps this distinction in mind,--valleys are the\nsunken places of the earth, canons are scored out by the glacier ploughs\nof God. They have a better name in the Rockies for these hill-fenced\nopen glades of pleasantness; they call them parks. Here and there in\nthe hill country one comes upon blind gullies fronted by high stony\nbarriers. These head also for the heart of the mountains; their\ndistinction is that they never get anywhere.\n\nAll mountain streets have streams to thread them, or deep grooves where\na stream might run. You would do well to avoid that range uncomforted by\nsinging floods. You will find it forsaken of most things but beauty and\nmadness and death and God. Many such lie east and north away from the\nmid Sierras, and quicken the imagination with the sense of purposes not\nrevealed, but the ordinary traveler brings nothing away from them but an\nintolerable thirst.\n\nThe river canons of the Sierras of the Snows are better worth while than\nmost Broadways, though the choice of them is like the choice of streets,\nnot very well determined by their names. There is always an amount of\nlocal history to be read in the names of mountain highways where one\ntouches the successive waves of occupation or discovery, as in the old\nvillages where the neighborhoods are not built but grow. Here you have\nthe Spanish Californian in Cero Gordo and pinon; Symmes and Shepherd,\npioneers both; Tunawai, probably Shoshone; Oak Creek, Kearsarge,--easy\nto fix the date of that christening,--Tinpah, Paiute that; Mist Canon\nand Paddy Jack's. The streets of the west Sierras sloping toward the\nSan Joaquin are long and winding, but from the east, my country, a day's\nride carries one to the lake regions. The next day reaches the passes\nof the high divide, but whether one gets passage depends a little on\nhow many have gone that road before, and much on one's own powers. The\npasses are steep and windy ridges, though not the highest. By two and\nthree thousand feet the snow-caps overtop them. It is even possible to\nwind through the Sierras without having passed above timber-line, but\none misses a great exhilaration.\n\nThe shape of a new mountain is roughly pyramidal, running out into\nlong shark-finned ridges that interfere and merge into other\nthunder-splintered sierras. You get the saw-tooth effect from a\ndistance, but the near-by granite bulk glitters with the terrible keen\npolish of old glacial ages. I say terrible; so it seems. When those\nglossy domes swim into the alpenglow, wet after rain, you conceive how\nlong and imperturbable are the purposes of God.\n\nNever believe what you are told, that midsummer is the best time to go\nup the streets of the mountain--well--perhaps for the merely idle or\nsportsmanly or scientific; but for seeing and understanding, the best\ntime is when you have the longest leave to stay. And here is a hint if\nyou would attempt the stateliest approaches; travel light, and as much\nas possible live off the land. Mulligatawny soup and tinned lobster will\nnot bring you the favor of the woodlanders.\n\nEvery canon commends itself for some particular pleasantness; this\nfor pines, another for trout, one for pure bleak beauty of granite\nbuttresses, one for its far-flung irised falls; and as I say, though\nsome are easier going, leads each to the cloud shouldering citadel.\nFirst, near the canon mouth you get the low-heading full-branched,\none-leaf pines. That is the sort of tree to know at sight, for the\nglobose, resin-dripping cones have palatable, nourishing kernels, the\nmain harvest of the Paiutes. That perhaps accounts for their growing\naccommodatingly below the limit of deep snows, grouped sombrely on the\nvalley-ward slopes. The real procession of the pines begins in the rifts\nwith the long-leafed Pinus jeffreyi, sighing its soul away upon the\nwind. And it ought not to sigh in such good company. Here begins the\nmanzanita, adjusting its tortuous stiff stems to the sharp waste of\nboulders, its pale olive leaves twisting edgewise to the sleek, ruddy,\nchestnut stems; begins also the meadowsweet, burnished laurel, and the\nmillion unregarded trumpets of the coral-red pentstemon. Wild life is\nlikely to be busiest about the lower pine borders. One looks in hollow\ntrees and hiving rocks for wild honey. The drone of bees, the chatter of\njays, the hurry and stir of squirrels, is incessant; the air is odorous\nand hot. The roar of the stream fills up the morning and evening\nintervals, and at night the deer feed in the buckthorn thickets. It is\nworth watching the year round in the purlieus of the long-leafed pines.\nOne month or another you set sight or trail of most roving mountain\ndwellers as they follow the limit of forbidding snows, and more bloom\nthan you can properly appreciate.\n\nWhatever goes up or comes down the streets of the mountains, water has\nthe right of way; it takes the lowest ground and the shortest passage.\nWhere the rifts are narrow, and some of the Sierra canons are not a\nstone's throw from wall to wall, the best trail for foot or horse winds\nconsiderably above the watercourses; but in a country of cone-bearers\nthere is usually a good strip of swardy sod along the canon floor. Pine\nwoods, the short-leafed Balfour and Murryana of the high Sierras, are\nsombre, rooted in the litter of a thousand years, hushed, and corrective\nto the spirit. The trail passes insensibly into them from the black\npines and a thin belt of firs. You look back as you rise, and strain for\nglimpses of the tawny valley, blue glints of the Bitter Lake, and tender\ncloud films on the farther ranges. For such pictures the pine\nbranches make a noble frame. Presently they close in wholly; they\ndraw mysteriously near, covering your tracks, giving up the trail\nindifferently, or with a secret grudge. You get a kind of impatience\nwith their locked ranks, until you come out lastly on some high, windy\ndome and see what they are about. They troop thickly up the open ways,\nriver banks, and brook borders; up open swales of dribbling springs;\nswarm over old moraines; circle the peaty swamps and part and meet about\nclean still lakes; scale the stony gullies; tormented, bowed, persisting\nto the door of the storm chambers, tall priests to pray for rain. The\nspring winds lift clouds of pollen dust, finer than frankincense, and\ntrail it out over high altars, staining the snow.\n\nNo doubt they understand this work better than we; in fact they know no\nother. \"Come,\" say the churches of the valleys, after a season of dry\nyears, \"let us pray for rain.\" They would do better to plant more trees.\n\nIt is a pity we have let the gift of lyric improvisation die out.\nSitting islanded on some gray peak above the encompassing wood, the soul\nis lifted up to sing the Iliad of the pines. They have no voice but the\nwind, and no sound of them rises up to the high places. But the waters,\nthe evidences of their power, that go down the steep and stony ways, the\noutlets of ice-bordered pools, the young rivers swaying with the force\nof their running, they sing and shout and trumpet at the falls, and the\nnoise of it far outreaches the forest spires. You see from these conning\ntowers how they call and find each other in the slender gorges; how\nthey fumble in the meadows, needing the sheer nearing walls to give them\ncountenance and show the way; and how the pine woods are made glad by\nthem.\n\nNothing else in the streets of the mountains gives such a sense of\npageantry as the conifers; other trees, if they are any, are home\ndwellers, like the tender fluttered, sisterhood of quaking asp. They\ngrow in clumps by spring borders, and all their stems have a permanent\ncurve toward the down slope, as you may also see in hillside pines,\nwhere they have borne the weight of sagging drifts.\n\nWell up from the valley, at the confluence of canons, are delectable\nsummer meadows. Fireweed flames about them against the gray boulders;\nstreams are open, go smoothly about the glacier slips and make deep\nbluish pools for trout. Pines raise statelier shafts and give themselves\nroom to grow,--gentians, shinleaf, and little grass of Parnassus in\ntheir golden checkered shadows; the meadow is white with violets and all\noutdoors keeps the clock. For example, when the ripples at the ford of\nthe creek raise a clear half tone,--sign that the snow water has come\ndown from the heated high ridges,--it is time to light the evening fire.\nWhen it drops off a note--but you will not know it except the Douglas\nsquirrel tells you with his high, fluty chirrup from the pines' aerial\ngloom--sign that some star watcher has caught the first far glint of the\nnearing sun. Whitney cries it from his vantage tower; it flashes from\nOppapago to the front of Williamson; LeConte speeds it to the westering\npeaks. The high rills wake and run, the birds begin. But down three\nthousand feet in the canon, where you stir the fire under the cooking\npot, it will not be day for an hour. It goes on, the play of light\nacross the high places, rosy, purpling, tender, glint and glow, thunder\nand windy flood, like the grave, exulting talk of elders above a merry\ngame.\n\nWho shall say what another will find most to his liking in the streets\nof the mountains. As for me, once set above the country of the\nsilver firs, I must go on until I find white columbine. Around the\namphitheatres of the lake regions and above them to the limit of\nperennial drifts they gather flock-wise in splintered rock wastes. The\ncrowds of them, the airy spread of sepals, the pale purity of the petal\nspurs, the quivering swing of bloom, obsesses the sense. One must learn\nto spare a little of the pang of inexpressible beauty, not to spend all\none's purse in one shop. There is always another year, and another.\n\nLingering on in the alpine regions until the first full snow, which\nis often before the cessation of bloom, one goes down in good company.\nFirst snows are soft and clogging and make laborious paths. Then it is\nthe roving inhabitants range down to the edge of the wood, below the\nlimit of early storms. Early winter and early spring one may have sight\nor track of deer and bear and bighorn, cougar and bobcat, about the\nthickets of buckthorn on open slopes between the black pines. But when\nthe ice crust is firm above the twenty foot drifts, they range far and\nforage where they will. Often in midwinter will come, now and then, a\nlong fall of soft snow piling three or four feet above the ice crust,\nand work a real hardship for the dwellers of these streets. When such a\nstorm portends the weather-wise blacktail will go down across the valley\nand up to the pastures of Waban where no more snow falls than suffices\nto nourish the sparsely growing pines. But the bighorn, the wild sheep,\nable to bear the bitterest storms with no signs of stress, cannot cope\nwith the loose shifty snow. Never such a storm goes over the mountains\nthat the Indians do not catch them floundering belly deep among the\nlower rifts. I have a pair of horns, inconceivably heavy, that were\nborne as late as a year ago by a very monarch of the flock whom death\novertook at the mouth of Oak Creek after a week of wet snow. He met it\nas a king should, with no vain effort or trembling, and it was wholly\nkind to take him so with four of his following rather than that the\nnight prowlers should find him.\n\nThere is always more life abroad in the winter hills than one looks to\nfind, and much more in evidence than in summer weather. Light feet of\nhare that make no print on the forest litter leave a wondrously plain\ntrack in the snow. We used to look and look at the beginning of winter\nfor the birds to come down from the pine lands; looked in the orchard\nand stubble; looked north and south on the mesa for their migratory\npassing, and wondered that they never came. Busy little grosbeaks picked\nabout the kitchen doors, and woodpeckers tapped the eaves of the farm\nbuildings, but we saw hardly any other of the frequenters of the summer\ncanons. After a while when we grew bold to tempt the snow borders we\nfound them in the street of the mountains. In the thick pine woods where\nthe overlapping boughs hung with snow-wreaths make wind-proof shelter\ntents, in a very community of dwelling, winter the bird-folk who get\ntheir living from the persisting cones and the larvae harboring bark.\nGround inhabiting species seek the dim snow chambers of the chaparral.\nConsider how it must be in a hill-slope overgrown with stout-twigged,\npartly evergreen shrubs, more than man high, and as thick as a hedge.\nNot all the canon's sifting of snow can fill the intricate spaces of\nthe hill tangles. Here and there an overhanging rock, or a stiff arch\nof buckthorn, makes an opening to communicating rooms and runways deep\nunder the snow.\n\nThe light filtering through the snow walls is blue and ghostly,\nbut serves to show seeds of shrubs and grass, and berries, and the\nwind-built walls are warm against the wind. It seems that live plants,\nespecially if they are evergreen and growing, give off heat; the snow\nwall melts earliest from within and hollows to thinnness before there is\na hint of spring in the air. But you think of these things afterward.\nUp in the street it has the effect of being done consciously; the\nbuckthorns lean to each other and the drift to them, the little birds\nrun in and out of their appointed ways with the greatest cheerfulness.\nThey give almost no tokens of distress, and even if the winter tries\nthem too much you are not to pity them. You of the house habit can\nhardly understand the sense of the hills. No doubt the labor of being\ncomfortable gives you an exaggerated opinion of yourself, an exaggerated\npain to be set aside. Whether the wild things understand it or not they\nadapt themselves to its processes with the greater ease. The\nbusiness that goes on in the street of the mountain is tremendous,\nworld-formative. Here go birds, squirrels, and red deer, children crying\nsmall wares and playing in the street, but they do not obstruct its\naffairs. Summer is their holiday; \"Come now,\" says the lord of the\nstreet, \"I have need of a great work and no more playing.\"\n\nBut they are left borders and breathing-space out of pure kindness. They\nare not pushed out except by the exigencies of the nobler plan which\nthey accept with a dignity the rest of us have not yet learned.\n\n\n\n\nWATER BORDERS\n\nI like that name the Indians give to the mountain of Lone Pine, and find\nit pertinent to my subject,--Oppapago, The Weeper. It sits eastward and\nsolitary from the lordliest ranks of the Sierras, and above a range of\nlittle, old, blunt hills, and has a bowed, grave aspect as of some woman\nyou might have known, looking out across the grassy barrows of her dead.\nFrom twin gray lakes under its noble brow stream down incessant white\nand tumbling waters. \"Mahala all time cry,\" said Winnenap', drawing\nfurrows in his rugged, wrinkled cheeks.\n\nThe origin of mountain streams is like the origin of tears, patent to\nthe understanding but mysterious to the sense. They are always at it,\nbut one so seldom catches them in the act. Here in the valley there is\nno cessation of waters even in the season when the niggard frost gives\nthem scant leave to run. They make the most of their midday hour, and\ntinkle all night thinly under the ice. An ear laid to the snow catches a\nmuffled hint of their eternal busyness fifteen or twenty feet under the\ncanon drifts, and long before any appreciable spring thaw, the sagging\nedges of the snow bridges mark out the place of their running. One\nwho ventures to look for it finds the immediate source of the spring\nfreshets--all the hill fronts furrowed with the reek of melting drifts,\nall the gravelly flats in a swirl of waters. But later, in June or July,\nwhen the camping season begins, there runs the stream away full and\nsinging, with no visible reinforcement other than an icy trickle from\nsome high, belated dot of snow. Oftenest the stream drops bodily from\nthe bleak bowl of some alpine lake; sometimes breaks out of a hillside\nas a spring where the ear can trace it under the rubble of loose stones\nto the neighborhood of some blind pool. But that leaves the lakes to be\naccounted for.\n\nThe lake is the eye of the mountain, jade green, placid, unwinking, also\nunfathomable. Whatever goes on under the high and stony brows is guessed\nat. It is always a favorite local tradition that one or another of the\nblind lakes is bottomless. Often they lie in such deep cairns of broken\nboulders that one never gets quite to them, or gets away unhurt. One\nsuch drops below the plunging slope that the Kearsarge trail winds over,\nperilously, nearing the pass. It lies still and wickedly green in its\nsharp-lipped cap, and the guides of that region love to tell of the\npacks and pack animals it has swallowed up.\n\nBut the lakes of Oppapago are perhaps not so deep, less green than gray,\nand better befriended. The ousel haunts them, while still hang about\ntheir coasts the thin undercut drifts that never quite leave the high\naltitudes. In and out of the bluish ice caves he flits and sings, and\nhis singing heard from above is sweet and uncanny like the Nixie's\nchord. One finds butterflies, too, about these high, sharp regions which\nmight be called desolate, but will not by me who love them. This is\nabove timber-line but not too high for comforting by succulent small\nherbs and golden tufted grass. A granite mountain does not crumble with\nalacrity, but once resolved to soil makes the best of it. Every handful\nof loose gravel not wholly water leached affords a plant footing, and\neven in such unpromising surroundings there is a choice of locations.\nThere is never going to be any communism of mountain herbage, their\naffinities are too sure. Full in the tunnels of snow water on gravelly,\nopen spaces in the shadow of a drift, one looks to find buttercups,\nfrozen knee-deep by night, and owning no desire but to ripen their fruit\nabove the icy bath. Soppy little plants of the portulaca and small,\nfine ferns shiver under the drip of falls and in dribbling crevices.\nThe bleaker the situation, so it is near a stream border, the better\nthe cassiope loves it. Yet I have not found it on the polished glacier\nslips, but where the country rock cleaves and splinters in the high\nwindy headlands that the wild sheep frequents, hordes and hordes of the\nwhite bells swing over matted, mossy foliage. On Oppapago, which is also\ncalled Sheep Mountain, one finds not far from the beds of cassiope the\nice-worn, stony hollows where the big-horns cradle their young.\n\nThese are above the wolf's quest and the eagle's wont, and though the\nheather beds are softer, they are neither so dry nor so warm, and here\nonly the stars go by. No other animal of any pretensions makes a habitat\nof the alpine regions. Now and then one gets a hint of some small, brown\ncreature, rat or mouse kind, that slips secretly among the rocks; no\nothers adapt themselves to desertness of aridity or altitude so readily\nas these ground inhabiting, graminivorous species. If there is an open\nstream the trout go up the lake as far as the water breeds food for\nthem, but the ousel goes farthest, for pure love of it.\n\nSince no lake can be at the highest point, it is possible to find plant\nlife higher than the water borders; grasses perhaps the highest, gilias,\nroyal blue trusses of polymonium, rosy plats of Sierra primroses. What\none has to get used to in flowers at high altitudes is the bleaching\nof the sun. Hardly do they hold their virgin color for a day, and this\nearly fading before their function is performed gives them a pitiful\nappearance not according with their hardihood. The color scheme runs\nalong the high ridges from blue to rosy purple, carmine and coral red;\nalong the water borders it is chiefly white and yellow where the mimulus\nmakes a vivid note, running into red when the two schemes meet and mix\nabout the borders of the meadows, at the upper limit of the columbine.\n\nHere is the fashion in which a mountain stream gets down from the\nperennial pastures of the snow to its proper level and identity as an\nirrigating ditch. It slips stilly by the glacier scoured rim of an ice\nbordered pool, drops over sheer, broken ledges to another pool, gathers\nitself, plunges headlong on a rocky ripple slope, finds a lake again,\nreinforced, roars downward to a pothole, foams and bridles, glides a\ntranquil reach in some still meadow, tumbles into a sharp groove between\nhill flanks, curdles under the stream tangles, and so arrives at the\nopen country and steadier going. Meadows, little strips of alpine\nfreshness, begin before the timberline is reached. Here one treads on\na carpet of dwarf willows, downy catkins of creditable size and the\ngreatest economy of foliage and stems. No other plant of high altitudes\nknows its business so well. It hugs the ground, grows roots from stem\njoints where no roots should be, grows a slender leaf or two and twice\nas many erect full catkins that rarely, even in that short growing\nseason, fail of fruit. Dipping over banks in the inlets of the creeks,\nthe fortunate find the rosy apples of the miniature manzanita, barely,\nbut always quite sufficiently, borne above the spongy sod. It does not\ndo to be anything but humble in the alpine regions, but not fearful. I\nhave pawed about for hours in the chill sward of meadows where one might\nproperly expect to get one's death, and got no harm from it, except it\nmight be Oliver Twist's complaint. One comes soon after this to shrubby\nwillows, and where willows are trout may be confidently looked for in\nmost Sierra streams. There is no accounting for their distribution;\nthough provident anglers have assisted nature of late, one still comes\nupon roaring brown waters where trout might very well be, but are not.\n\nThe highest limit of conifers--in the middle Sierras, the white bark\npine--is not along the water border. They come to it about the level of\nthe heather, but they have no such affinity for dampness as the tamarack\npines. Scarcely any bird-note breaks the stillness of the timber-line,\nbut chipmunks inhabit here, as may be guessed by the gnawed ruddy cones\nof the pines, and lowering hours the woodchucks come down to the water.\nOn a little spit of land running into Windy Lake we found one summer the\nevidence of a tragedy; a pair of sheep's horns not fully grown caught in\nthe crotch of a pine where the living sheep must have lodged them.\nThe trunk of the tree had quite closed over them, and the skull bones\ncrumbled away from the weathered horn cases. We hoped it was not too\nfar out of the running of night prowlers to have put a speedy end to the\nlong agony, but we could not be sure. I never liked the spit of Windy\nLake again.\n\nIt seems that all snow nourished plants count nothing so excellent in\ntheir kind as to be forehanded with their bloom, working secretly to\nthat end under the high piled winters. The heathers begin by the lake\nborders, while little sodden drifts still shelter under their branches.\nI have seen the tiniest of them (Kalmia glauca) blooming, and with\nwell-formed fruit, a foot away from a snowbank from which it could\nhardly have emerged within a week. Somehow the soul of the heather\nhas entered into the blood of the English-speaking. \"And oh! is that\nheather?\" they say; and the most indifferent ends by picking a sprig of\nit in a hushed, wondering way. One must suppose that the root of their\nrespective races issued from the glacial borders at about the same\nepoch, and remember their origin.\n\nAmong the pines where the slope of the land allows it, the streams run\ninto smooth, brown, trout-abounding rills across open flats that are\nin reality filled lake basins. These are the displaying grounds of the\ngentians--blue--blue--eye-blue, perhaps, virtuous and likable flowers.\nOne is not surprised to learn that they have tonic properties. But if\nyour meadow should be outside the forest reserve, and the sheep have\nbeen there, you will find little but the shorter, paler G. newberryii,\nand in the matted sods of the little tongues of greenness that lick\nup among the pines along the watercourses, white, scentless, nearly\nstemless, alpine violets.\n\nAt about the nine thousand foot level and in the summer there will be\nhosts of rosy-winged dodecatheon, called shooting-stars, outlining the\ncrystal tunnels in the sod. Single flowers have often a two-inch\nspread of petal, and the full, twelve blossomed heads above the slender\npedicels have the airy effect of wings.\n\nIt is about this level one looks to find the largest lakes with thick\nranks of pines bearing down on them, often swamped in the summer floods\nand paying the inevitable penalty for such encroachment. Here in wet\ncoves of the hills harbors that crowd of bloom that makes the wonder of\nthe Sierra canons.\n\nThey drift under the alternate flicker and gloom of the windy rooms\nof pines, in gray rock shelters, and by the ooze of blind springs, and\ntheir juxtapositions are the best imaginable. Lilies come up out of fern\nbeds, columbine swings over meadowsweet, white rein-orchids quake in the\nleaning grass. Open swales, where in wet years may be running water, are\nplantations of false hellebore (Veratrum californicum), tall, branched\ncandelabra of greenish bloom above the sessile, sheathing, boat-shaped\nleaves, semi-translucent in the sun. A stately plant of the lily family,\nbut why \"false?\" It is frankly offensive in its character, and its young\njuices deadly as any hellebore that ever grew.\n\nLike most mountain herbs, it has an uncanny haste to bloom. One hears\nby night, when all the wood is still, the crepitatious rustle of the\nunfolding leaves and the pushing flower-stalk within, that has open\nblossoms before it has fairly uncramped from the sheath. It commends\nitself by a certain exclusiveness of growth, taking enough room and\nnever elbowing; for if the flora of the lake region has a fault it is\nthat there is too much of it. We have more than three hundred species\nfrom Kearsarge Canon alone, and if that does not include them all it is\nbecause they were already collected otherwhere.\n\nOne expects to find lakes down to about nine thousand feet, leading into\neach other by comparatively open ripple slopes and white cascades. Below\nthe lakes are filled basins that are still spongy swamps, or substantial\nmeadows, as they get down and down.\n\nHere begin the stream tangles. On the east slopes of the middle Sierras\nthe pines, all but an occasional yellow variety, desert the stream\nborders about the level of the lowest lakes, and the birches and\ntree-willows begin. The firs hold on almost to the mesa levels,--there\nare no foothills on this eastern slope,--and whoever has firs misses\nnothing else. It goes without saying that a tree that can afford to take\nfifty years to its first fruiting will repay acquaintance. It keeps,\ntoo, all that half century, a virginal grace of outline, but having once\nflowered, begins quietly to put away the things of its youth. Years by\nyear the lower rounds of boughs are shed, leaving no scar; year by year\nthe star-branched minarets approach the sky. A fir-tree loves a water\nborder, loves a long wind in a draughty canon, loves to spend itself\nsecretly on the inner finishings of its burnished, shapely cones. Broken\nopen in mid-season the petal-shaped scales show a crimson satin surface,\nperfect as a rose.\n\nThe birch--the brown-bark western birch characteristic of lower stream\ntangles--is a spoil sport. It grows thickly to choke the stream that\nfeeds it; grudges it the sky and space for angler's rod and fly. The\nwillows do better; painted-cup, cypripedium, and the hollow stalks\nof span-broad white umbels, find a footing among their stems. But in\ngeneral the steep plunges, the white swirls, green and tawny pools, the\ngliding hush of waters between the meadows and the mesas afford little\nfishing and few flowers.\n\nOne looks for these to begin again when once free of the rifted canon\nwalls; the high note of babble and laughter falls off to the steadier\nmellow tone of a stream that knows its purpose and reflects the sky.\n\n\n\n\nOTHER WATER BORDERS\n\nIt is the proper destiny of every considerable stream in the west to\nbecome an irrigating ditch. It would seem the streams are willing. They\ngo as far as they can, or dare, toward the tillable lands in their own\nboulder fenced gullies--but how much farther in the man-made waterways.\nIt is difficult to come into intimate relations with appropriated\nwaters; like very busy people they have no time to reveal themselves.\nOne needs to have known an irrigating ditch when it was a brook, and to\nhave lived by it, to mark the morning and evening tone of its crooning,\nrising and falling to the excess of snow water; to have watched far\nacross the valley, south to the Eclipse and north to the Twisted Dyke,\nthe shining wall of the village water gate; to see still blue herons\nstalking the little glinting weirs across the field.\n\nPerhaps to get into the mood of the waterways one needs to have seen\nold Amos Judson asquat on the headgate with his gun, guarding his\nwater-right toward the end of a dry summer. Amos owned the half of Tule\nCreek and the other half pertained to the neighboring Greenfields ranch.\nYears of a \"short water crop,\" that is, when too little snow fell on the\nhigh pine ridges, or, falling, melted too early, Amos held that it took\nall the water that came down to make his half, and maintained it with\na Winchester and a deadly aim. Jesus Montana, first proprietor\nof Greenfields,--you can see at once that Judson had the racial\nadvantage,--contesting the right with him, walked into five of Judson's\nbullets and his eternal possessions on the same occasion. That was the\nHomeric age of settlement and passed into tradition. Twelve years later\none of the Clarks, holding Greenfields, not so very green by now, shot\none of the Judsons. Perhaps he hoped that also might become classic, but\nthe jury found for manslaughter. It had the effect of discouraging the\nGreenfields claim, but Amos used to sit on the headgate just the same,\nas quaint and lone a figure as the sandhill crane watching for water\ntoads below the Tule drop.\n\nEvery subsequent owner of Greenfields bought it with Amos in full view.\nThe last of these was Diedrick. Along in August of that year came a week\nof low water. Judson's ditch failed and he went out with his rifle to\nlearn why. There on the headgate sat Diedrick's frau with a long-handled\nshovel across her lap and all the water turned into Diedrick's ditch;\nthere she sat knitting through the long sun, and the children brought\nout her dinner. It was all up with Amos; he was too much of a gentleman\nto fight a lady--that was the way he expressed it. She was a very large\nlady, and a long-handled shovel is no mean weapon. The next year Judson\nand Diedrick put in a modern water gauge and took the summer ebb in\nequal inches. Some of the water-right difficulties are more squalid than\nthis, some more tragic; but unless you have known them you cannot very\nwell know what the water thinks as it slips past the gardens and in the\nlong slow sweeps of the canal. You get that sense of brooding from the\nconfined and sober floods, not all at once but by degrees, as one might\nbecome aware of a middle-aged and serious neighbor who has had that in\nhis life to make him so. It is the repose of the completely accepted\ninstinct.\n\nWith the water runs a certain following of thirsty herbs and shrubs. The\nwillows go as far as the stream goes, and a bit farther on the slightest\nprovocation. They will strike root in the leak of a flume, or the\ndribble of an overfull bank, coaxing the water beyond its appointed\nbounds. Given a new waterway in a barren land, and in three years the\nwillows have fringed all its miles of banks; three years more and they\nwill touch tops across it. It is perhaps due to the early usurpation\nof the willows that so little else finds growing-room along the large\ncanals. The birch beginning far back in the canon tangles is more\nconservative; it is shy of man haunts and needs to have the permanence\nof its drink assured. It stops far short of the summer limit of waters,\nand I have never known it to take up a position on the banks beyond\nthe ploughed lands. There is something almost like premeditation in the\navoidance of cultivated tracts by certain plants of water borders. The\nclematis, mingling its foliage secretly with its host, comes down with\nthe stream tangles to the village fences, skips over to corners of\nlittle used pasture lands and the plantations that spring up about\nwaste water pools; but never ventures a footing in the trail of spade or\nplough; will not be persuaded to grow in any garden plot. On the other\nhand, the horehound, the common European species imported with the\ncolonies, hankers after hedgerows and snug little borders. It is more\nwidely distributed than many native species, and may be always found\nalong the ditches in the village corners, where it is not appreciated.\nThe irrigating ditch is an impartial distributer. It gathers all the\nalien weeds that come west in garden and grass seeds and affords\nthem harbor in its banks. There one finds the European mallow (Malva\nrotundifolia) spreading out to the streets with the summer overflow, and\nevery spring a dandelion or two, brought in with the blue grass seed,\nuncurls in the swardy soil. Farther than either of these have come the\nlilies that the Chinese coolies cultivate in adjacent mud holes for\ntheir foodful bulbs. The seegoo establishes itself very readily in\nswampy borders, and the white blossom spikes among the arrow-pointed\nleaves are quite as acceptable to the eye as any native species.\n\nIn the neighborhood of towns founded by the Spanish Californians,\nwhether this plant is native to the locality or not, one can always find\naromatic clumps of yerba buena, the \"good herb\" (Micromeria douglassii).\nThe virtue of it as a febrifuge was taught to the mission fathers by the\nneophytes, and wise old dames of my acquaintance have worked astonishing\ncures with it and the succulent yerba mansa. This last is native to wet\nmeadows and distinguished enough to have a family all to itself.\n\nWhere the irrigating ditches are shallow and a little neglected, they\nchoke quickly with watercress that multiplies about the lowest Sierra\nsprings. It is characteristic of the frequenters of water borders near\nman haunts, that they are chiefly of the sorts that are useful to\nman, as if they made their services an excuse for the intrusion. The\njoint-grass of soggy pastures produces edible, nut-flavored tubers,\ncalled by the Indians taboose. The common reed of the ultramontane\nmarshes (here Phragmites vulgaris), a very stately, whispering reed,\nlight and strong for shafts or arrows, affords sweet sap and pith which\nmakes a passable sugar.\n\nIt seems the secrets of plant powers and influences yield themselves\nmost readily to primitive peoples, at least one never hears of the\nknowledge coming from any other source. The Indian never concerns\nhimself, as the botanist and the poet, with the plant's appearances and\nrelations, but with what it can do for him.\n\nIt can do much, but how do you suppose he finds it out; what instincts\nor accidents guide him? How does a cat know when to eat catnip? Why do\nwestern bred cattle avoid loco weed, and strangers eat it and go mad?\nOne might suppose that in a time of famine the Paiutes digged wild\nparsnip in meadow corners and died from eating it, and so learned to\nproduce death swiftly and at will. But how did they learn, repenting in\nthe last agony, that animal fat is the best antidote for its virulence;\nand who taught them that the essence of joint pine (Ephedra nevadensis),\nwhich looks to have no juice in it of any sort, is efficacious in\nstomachic disorders. But they so understand and so use. One believes\nit to be a sort of instinct atrophied by disuse in a complexer\ncivilization. I remember very well when I came first upon a wet meadow\nof yerba mansa, not knowing its name or use. It looked potent; the\ncool, shiny leaves, the succulent, pink stems and fruity bloom. A little\ntouch, a hint, a word, and I should have known what use to put them to.\nSo I felt, unwilling to leave it until we had come to an understanding.\nSo a musician might have felt in the presence of an instrument known to\nbe within his province, but beyond his power. It was with the relieved\nsense of having shaped a long surmise that I watched the Senora Romero\nmake a poultice of it for my burned hand.\n\nOn, down from the lower lakes to the village weirs, the brown and golden\ndisks of helenum have beauty as a sufficient excuse for being. The\nplants anchor out on tiny capes, or mid-stream islets, with the nearly\nsessile radicle leaves submerged. The flowers keep up a constant\ntrepidation in time with the hasty water beating at their stems,\na quivering, instinct with life, that seems always at the point of\nbreaking into flight; just as the babble of the watercourses always\napproaches articulation but never quite achieves it. Although of wide\nrange the helenum never makes itself common through profusion, and may\nbe looked for in the same places from year to year. Another lake\ndweller that comes down to the ploughed lands is the red columbine. (\nC.truncata). It requires no encouragement other than shade, but grows\ntoo rank in the summer heats and loses its wildwood grace. A common\nenough orchid in these parts is the false lady's slipper (Epipactis\ngigantea), one that springs up by any water where there is sufficient\ngrowth of other sorts to give it countenance. It seems to thrive best in\nan atmosphere of suffocation.\n\nThe middle Sierras fall off abruptly eastward toward the high valleys.\nPeaks of the fourteen thousand class, belted with sombre swathes\nof pine, rise almost directly from the bench lands with no foothill\napproaches. At the lower edge of the bench or mesa the land falls away,\noften by a fault, to the river hollows, and along the drop one looks for\nsprings or intermittent swampy swales. Here the plant world resembles a\nlittle the lake gardens, modified by altitude and the use the town folk\nput it to for pasture. Here are cress, blue violets, potentilla, and, in\nthe damp of the willow fence-rows, white false asphodels. I am sure we\nmake too free use of this word FALSE in naming plants--false mallow,\nfalse lupine, and the like. The asphodel is at least no falsifier, but\na true lily by all the heaven-set marks, though small of flower and\nrun mostly to leaves, and should have a name that gives it credit for\ngrowing up in such celestial semblance. Native to the mesa meadows is a\npale iris, gardens of it acres wide, that in the spring season of full\nbloom make an airy fluttering as of azure wings. Single flowers are\ntoo thin and sketchy of outline to affect the imagination, but the full\nfields have the misty blue of mirage waters rolled across desert sand,\nand quicken the senses to the anticipation of things ethereal. A very\npoet's flower, I thought; not fit for gathering up, and proving a\nnuisance in the pastures, therefore needing to be the more loved. And\none day I caught Winnenap' drawing out from mid leaf a fine strong fibre\nfor making snares. The borders of the iris fields are pure gold, nearly\nsessile buttercups and a creeping-stemmed composite of a redder hue. I\nam convinced that English-speaking children will always have buttercups.\nIf they do not light upon the original companion of little frogs\nthey will take the next best and cherish it accordingly. I find\nfive unrelated species loved by that name, and as many more and as\ninappropriately called cowslips.\n\nBy every mesa spring one may expect to find a single shrub of the\nbuckthorn, called of old time Cascara sagrada--the sacred bark. Up\nin the canons, within the limit of the rains, it seeks rather a stony\nslope, but in the dry valleys is not found away from water borders.\n\nIn all the valleys and along the desert edges of the west are\nconsiderable areas of soil sickly with alkali-collecting pools, black\nand evil-smelling like old blood. Very little grows hereabout but\nthick-leaved pickle weed. Curiously enough, in this stiff mud, along\nroadways where there is frequently a little leakage from canals, grows\nthe only western representative of the true heliotropes (Heliotropium\ncurassavicum). It has flowers of faded white, foliage of faded green,\nresembling the \"live-for-ever\" of old gardens and graveyards, but even\nless attractive. After so much schooling in the virtues of water-seeking\nplants, one is not surprised to learn that its mucilaginous sap has\nhealing powers.\n\nLast and inevitable resort of overflow waters is the tulares, great\nwastes of reeds (Juncus) in sickly, slow streams. The reeds, called\ntules, are ghostly pale in winter, in summer deep poisonous-looking\ngreen, the waters thick and brown; the reed beds breaking into dingy\npools, clumps of rotting willows, narrow winding water lanes and sinking\npaths. The tules grow inconceivably thick in places, standing man-high\nabove the water; cattle, no, not any fish nor fowl can penetrate them.\nOld stalks succumb slowly; the bed soil is quagmire, settling with the\nweight as it fills and fills. Too slowly for counting they raise little\nislands from the bog and reclaim the land. The waters pushed out cut\ndeeper channels, gnaw off the edges of the solid earth.\n\nThe tulares are full of mystery and malaria. That is why we have meant\nto explore them and have never done so. It must be a happy mystery. So\nyou would think to hear the redwinged blackbirds proclaim it clear March\nmornings. Flocks of them, and every flock a myriad, shelter in the dry,\nwhispering stems. They make little arched runways deep into the heart\nof the tule beds. Miles across the valley one hears the clamor of their\nhigh, keen flutings in the mating weather.\n\nWild fowl, quacking hordes of them, nest in the tulares. Any day's\nventure will raise from open shallows the great blue heron on his hollow\nwings. Chill evenings the mallard drakes cry continually from the glassy\npools, the bittern's hollow boom rolls along the water paths. Strange\nand farflown fowl drop down against the saffron, autumn sky. All day\nwings beat above it hazy with speed; long flights of cranes glimmer in\nthe twilight. By night one wakes to hear the clanging geese go over.\nOne wishes for, but gets no nearer speech from those the reedy fens have\nswallowed up. What they do there, how fare, what find, is the secret of\nthe tulares.\n\n\n\n\nNURSLINGS OF THE SKY\n\nChoose a hill country for storms. There all the business of the weather\nis carried on above your horizon and loses its terror in familiarity.\nWhen you come to think about it, the disastrous storms are on the\nlevels, sea or sand or plains. There you get only a hint of what is\nabout to happen, the fume of the gods rising from their meeting place\nunder the rim of the world; and when it breaks upon you there is no stay\nnor shelter. The terrible mewings and mouthings of a Kansas wind have\nthe added terror of viewlessness. You are lapped in them like uprooted\ngrass; suspect them of a personal grudge. But the storms of hill\ncountries have other business. They scoop watercourses, manure the\npines, twist them to a finer fibre, fit the firs to be masts and spars,\nand, if you keep reasonably out of the track of their affairs, do you no\nharm.\n\nThey have habits to be learned, appointed paths, seasons, and warnings,\nand they leave you in no doubt about their performances. One who builds\nhis house on a water scar or the rubble of a steep slope must take\nchances. So they did in Overtown who built in the wash of Argus water,\nand at Kearsarge at the foot of a steep, treeless swale. After twenty\nyears Argus water rose in the wash against the frail houses, and the\npiled snows of Kearsarge slid down at a thunder peal over the cabins and\nthe camp, but you could conceive that it was the fault of neither the\nwater nor the snow.\n\nThe first effect of cloud study is a sense of presence and intention\nin storm processes. Weather does not happen. It is the visible\nmanifestation of the Spirit moving itself in the void. It gathers itself\ntogether under the heavens; rains, snows, yearns mightily in wind,\nsmiles; and the Weather Bureau, situated advantageously for that very\nbusiness, taps the record on his instruments and going out on the\nstreets denies his God, not having gathered the sense of what he has\nseen. Hardly anybody takes account of the fact that John Muir, who knows\nmore of mountain storms than any other, is a devout man.\n\nOf the high Sierras choose the neighborhood of the splintered peaks\nabout the Kern and King's river divide for storm study, or the short,\nwide-mouthed canons opening eastward on high valleys. Days when the\nhollows are steeped in a warm, winey flood the clouds came walking on\nthe floor of heaven, flat and pearly gray beneath, rounded and pearly\nwhite above. They gather flock-wise, moving on the level currents that\nroll about the peaks, lock hands and settle with the cooler air, drawing\na veil about those places where they do their work. If their meeting or\nparting takes place at sunrise or sunset, as it often does, one gets\nthe splendor of the apocalypse. There will be cloud pillars miles high,\nsnow-capped, glorified, and preserving an orderly perspective before the\nunbarred door of the sun, or perhaps mere ghosts of clouds that dance\nto some pied piper of an unfelt wind. But be it day or night, once they\nhave settled to their work, one sees from the valley only the blank wall\nof their tents stretched along the ranges. To get the real effect of a\nmountain storm you must be inside.\n\nOne who goes often into a hill country learns not to say: What if it\nshould rain? It always does rain somewhere among the peaks: the unusual\nthing is that one should escape it. You might suppose that if you took\nany account of plant contrivances to save their pollen powder against\nshowers. Note how many there are deep-throated and bell-flowered like\nthe pentstemons, how many have nodding pedicels as the columbine, how\nmany grow in copse shelters and grow there only. There is keen delight\nin the quick showers of summer canons, with the added comfort, born\nof experience, of knowing that no harm comes of a wetting at high\naltitudes. The day is warm; a white cloud spies over the canon wall,\nslips up behind the ridge to cross it by some windy pass, obscures your\nsun. Next you hear the rain drum on the broad-leaved hellebore, and beat\ndown the mimulus beside the brook.\n\nYou shelter on the lee of some strong pine with shut-winged butterflies\nand merry, fiddling creatures of the wood. Runnels of rain water from\nthe glacier-slips swirl through the pine needles into rivulets; the\nstreams froth and rise in their banks. The sky is white with cloud; the\nsky is gray with rain; the sky is clear. The summer showers leave no\nwake.\n\nSuch as these follow each other day by day for weeks in August weather.\nSometimes they chill suddenly into wet snow that packs about the\nlake gardens clear to the blossom frills, and melts away harmlessly.\nSometimes one has the good fortune from a heather-grown headland to\nwatch a rain-cloud forming in mid-air. Out over meadow or lake region\nbegins a little darkling of the sky,--no cloud, no wind, just a\nsmokiness such as spirits materialize from in witch stories.\n\nIt rays out and draws to it some floating films from secret canons.\nRain begins, \"slow dropping veil of thinnest lawn;\" a wind comes up and\ndrives the formless thing across a meadow, or a dull lake pitted by the\nglancing drops, dissolving as it drives. Such rains relieve like tears.\n\nThe same season brings the rains that have work to do, ploughing storms\nthat alter the face of things. These come with thunder and the play of\nlive fire along the rocks. They come with great winds that try the pines\nfor their work upon the seas and strike out the unfit. They shake down\navalanches of splinters from sky-line pinnacles and raise up sudden\nfloods like battle fronts in the canons against towns, trees, and\nboulders. They would be kind if they could, but have more important\nmatters. Such storms, called cloud-bursts by the country folk, are not\nrain, rather the spillings of Thor's cup, jarred by the Thunderer. After\nsuch a one the water that comes up in the village hydrants miles away is\nwhite with forced bubbles from the wind-tormented streams.\n\nAll that storms do to the face of the earth you may read in the\ngeographies, but not what they do to our contemporaries. I remember one\nnight of thunderous rain made unendurably mournful by the houseless cry\nof a cougar whose lair, and perhaps his family, had been buried under\na slide of broken boulders on the slope of Kearsarge. We had heard the\nheavy detonation of the slide about the hour of the alpenglow, a pale\nrosy interval in a darkling air, and judged he must have come from\nhunting to the ruined cliff and paced the night out before it, crying a\nvery human woe. I remember, too, in that same season of storms, a lake\nmade milky white for days, and crowded out of its bed by clay washed\ninto it by a fury of rain, with the trout floating in it belly up,\nstunned by the shock of the sudden flood. But there were trout enough\nfor what was left of the lake next year and the beginning of a meadow\nabout its upper rim. What taxed me most in the wreck of one of my\nfavorite canons by cloud-burst was to see a bobcat mother mouthing her\ndrowned kittens in the ruined lair built in the wash, far above the\nlimit of accustomed waters, but not far enough for the unexpected. After\na time you get the point of view of gods about these things to save you\nfrom being too pitiful.\n\nThe great snows that come at the beginning of winter, before there is\nyet any snow except the perpetual high banks, are best worth while to\nwatch. These come often before the late bloomers are gone and while the\nmigratory birds are still in the piney woods. Down in the valley you see\nlittle but the flocking of blackbirds in the streets, or the low\nflight of mallards over the tulares, and the gathering of clouds\nbehind Williamson. First there is a waiting stillness in the wood; the\npine-trees creak although there is no wind, the sky glowers, the firs\nrock by the water borders. The noise of the creek rises insistently\nand falls off a full note like a child abashed by sudden silence in the\nroom.\n\nThis changing of the stream-tone following tardily the changes of the\nsun on melting snows is most meaningful of wood notes. After it runs\na little trumpeter wind to cry the wild creatures to their holes.\nSometimes the warning hangs in the air for days with increasing\nstillness. Only Clark's crow and the strident jays make light of it;\nonly they can afford to. The cattle get down to the foothills and\nground-inhabiting creatures make fast their doors. It grows chill, blind\nclouds fumble in the canons; there will be a roll of thunder, perhaps,\nor a flurry of rain, but mostly the snow is born in the air with\nquietness and the sense of strong white pinions softly stirred. It\nincreases, is wet and clogging, and makes a white night of midday.\n\nThere is seldom any wind with first snows, more often rain, but later,\nwhen there is already a smooth foot or two over all the slopes, the\ndrifts begin. The late snows are fine and dry, mere ice granules at the\nwind's will. Keen mornings after a storm they are blown out in wreaths\nand banners from the high ridges sifting into the canons.\n\nOnce in a year or so we have a \"big snow.\" The cloud tents are widened\nout to shut in the valley and an outlying range or two and are drawn\ntight against the sun. Such a storm begins warm, with a dry white mist\nthat fills and fills between the ridges, and the air is thick with\nformless groaning. Now for days you get no hint of the neighboring\nranges until the snows begin to lighten and some shouldering peak\nlifts through a rent. Mornings after the heavy snows are steely blue,\ntwo-edged with cold, divinely fresh and still, and these are times to go\nup to the pine borders. There you may find floundering in the unstable\ndrifts \"tainted wethers\" of the wild sheep, faint from age and hunger;\neasy prey. Even the deer make slow going in the thick fresh snow, and\nonce we found a wolverine going blind and feebly in the white glare.\n\nNo tree takes the snow stress with such ease as the silver fir. The\nstar-whorled, fan-spread branches droop under the soft wreaths--droop\nand press flatly to the trunk; presently the point of overloading is\nreached, there is a soft sough and muffled drooping, the boughs recover,\nand the weighting goes on until the drifts have reached the midmost\nwhorls and covered up the branches.\n\nWhen the snows are particularly wet and heavy they spread over the young\nfirs in green-ribbed tents wherein harbor winter loving birds.\n\nAll storms of desert hills, except wind storms, are impotent. East and\neast of the Sierras they rise in nearly parallel ranges, desertward, and\nno rain breaks over them, except from some far-strayed cloud or roving\nwind from the California Gulf, and these only in winter. In summer the\nsky travails with thunderings and the flare of sheet lightnings to win\na few blistering big drops, and once in a lifetime the chance of a\ntorrent. But you have not known what force resides in the mindless\nthings until you have known a desert wind. One expects it at the turn of\nthe two seasons, wet and dry, with electrified tense nerves. Along the\nedge of the mesa where it drops off to the valley, dust devils begin to\nrise white and steady, fanning out at the top like the genii out of the\nFisherman's bottle. One supposes the Indians might have learned the\nuse of smoke signals from these dust pillars as they learn most things\ndirect from the tutelage of the earth. The air begins to move fluently,\nblowing hot and cold between the ranges. Far south rises a murk of sand\nagainst the sky; it grows, the wind shakes itself, and has a smell of\nearth. The cloud of small dust takes on the color of gold and shuts out\nthe neighborhood, the push of the wind is unsparing. Only man of all\nfolk is foolish enough to stir abroad in it. But being in a house is\nreally much worse; no relief from the dust, and a great fear of the\ncreaking timbers. There is no looking ahead in such a wind, and the bite\nof the small sharp sand on exposed skin is keener than any insect sting.\nOne might sleep, for the lapping of the wind wears one to the point\nof exhaustion very soon, but there is dread, in open sand stretches\nsometimes justified, of being over blown by the drift. It is hot, dry,\nfretful work, but by going along the ground with the wind behind, one\nmay come upon strange things in its tumultuous privacy. I like these\ntruces of wind and heat that the desert makes, otherwise I do not know\nhow I should come by so many acquaintances with furtive folk. I like\nto see hawks sitting daunted in shallow holes, not daring to spread a\nfeather, and doves in a row by the prickle-bushes, and shut-eyed cattle,\nturned tail to the wind in a patient doze. I like the smother of sand\namong the dunes, and finding small coiled snakes in open places, but I\nnever like to come in a wind upon the silly sheep. The wind robs them of\nwhat wit they had, and they seem never to have learned the self-induced\nhypnotic stupor with which most wild things endure weather stress. I\nhave never heard that the desert winds brought harm to any other than\nthe wandering shepherds and their flocks. Once below Pastaria Little\nPete showed me bones sticking out of the sand where a flock of two\nhundred had been smothered in a bygone wind. In many places the\nfour-foot posts of a cattle fence had been buried by the wind-blown\ndunes.\n\nIt is enough occupation, when no storm is brewing, to watch the cloud\ncurrents and the chambers of the sky. From Kearsarge, say, you look over\nInyo and find pink soft cloud masses asleep on the level desert air;\nsouth of you hurries a white troop late to some gathering of their kind\nat the back of Oppapago; nosing the foot of Waban, a woolly mist creeps\nsouth. In the clean, smooth paths of the middle sky and highest up in\nair, drift, unshepherded, small flocks ranging contrarily. You will\nfind the proper names of these things in the reports of the Weather\nBureau--cirrus, cumulus, and the like and charts that will teach by\nstudy when to sow and take up crops. It is astonishing the trouble\nmen will be at to find out when to plant potatoes, and gloze over the\neternal meaning of the skies. You have to beat out for yourself many\nmornings on the windy headlands the sense of the fact that you get the\nsame rainbow in the cloud drift over Waban and the spray of your garden\nhose. And not necessarily then do you live up to it.\n\n\n\n\nTHE LITTLE TOWN OF THE GRAPE VINES\n\nThere are still some places in the west where the quails cry \"cuidado\";\nwhere all the speech is soft, all the manners gentle; where all the\ndishes have chile in them, and they make more of the Sixteenth of\nSeptember than they do of the Fourth of July. I mean in particular El\nPueblo de Las Uvas. Where it lies, how to come at it, you will not get\nfrom me; rather would I show you the heron's nest in the tulares. It has\na peak behind it, glinting above the tamarack pines, above a breaker of\nruddy hills that have a long slope valley-wards and the shoreward steep\nof waves toward the Sierras.\n\nBelow the Town of the Grape Vines, which shortens to Las Uvas for\ncommon use, the land dips away to the river pastures and the tulares.\nIt shrouds under a twilight thicket of vines, under a dome of\ncottonwood-trees, drowsy and murmurous as a hive. Hereabouts are some\nstrips of tillage and the headgates that dam up the creek for the\nvillage weirs; upstream you catch the growl of the arrastra. Wild vines\nthat begin among the willows lap over to the orchard rows, take the\ntrellis and roof-tree.\n\nThere is another town above Las Uvas that merits some attention, a town\nof arches and airy crofts, full of linnets, blackbirds, fruit birds,\nsmall sharp hawks, and mockingbirds that sing by night. They pour out\npiercing, unendurably sweet cavatinas above the fragrance of bloom and\nmusky smell of fruit. Singing is in fact the business of the night\nat Las Uvas as sleeping is for midday. When the moon comes over the\nmountain wall new-washed from the sea, and the shadows lie like lace\non the stamped floors of the patios, from recess to recess of the vine\ntangle runs the thrum of guitars and the voice of singing.\n\nAt Las Uvas they keep up all the good customs brought out of Old Mexico\nor bred in a lotus-eating land; drink, and are merry and look out for\nsomething to eat afterward; have children, nine or ten to a family, have\ncock-fights, keep the siesta, smoke cigarettes and wait for the sun\nto go down. And always they dance; at dusk on the smooth adobe floors,\nafternoons under the trellises where the earth is damp and has a fruity\nsmell. A betrothal, a wedding, or a christening, or the mere proximity\nof a guitar is sufficient occasion; and if the occasion lacks, send for\nthe guitar and dance anyway.\n\nAll this requires explanation. Antonio Sevadra, drifting this way from\nOld Mexico with the flood that poured into the Tappan district after the\nfirst notable strike, discovered La Golondrina. It was a generous lode\nand Tony a good fellow; to work it he brought in all the Sevadras, even\nto the twice-removed; all the Castros who were his wife's family,\nall the Saises, Romeros, and Eschobars,--the relations of his\nrelations-in-law. There you have the beginning of a pretty considerable\ntown. To these accrued much of the Spanish California float swept out\nof the southwest by eastern enterprise. They slacked away again when the\nprice of silver went down, and the ore dwindled in La Golondrina. All\nthe hot eddy of mining life swept away from that corner of the hills,\nbut there were always those too idle, too poor to move, or too easily\ncontent with El Pueblo de Las Uvas.\n\nNobody comes nowadays to the town of the grape vines except, as we say,\n\"with the breath of crying,\" but of these enough. All the low sills run\nover with small heads. Ah, ah! There is a kind of pride in that if you\ndid but know it, to have your baby every year or so as the time sets,\nand keep a full breast. So great a blessing as marriage is easily come\nby. It is told of Ruy Garcia that when he went for his marriage license\nhe lacked a dollar of the clerk's fee, but borrowed it of the sheriff,\nwho expected reelection and exhibited thereby a commendable thrift.\nOf what account is it to lack meal or meat when you may have it of any\nneighbor? Besides, there is sometimes a point of honor in these things.\nJesus Romero, father of ten, had a job sacking ore in the Marionette\nwhich he gave up of his own accord. \"Eh, why?\" said Jesus, \"for my\nfam'ly.\"\n\n\"It is so, senora,\" he said solemnly, \"I go to the Marionette, I work,\nI eat meat--pie--frijoles--good, ver' good. I come home sad'day nigh'\nI see my fam'ly. I play lil' game poker with the boys, have lil' drink\nwine, my money all gone. My fam'ly have no money, nothing eat. All time\nI work at mine I eat, good, ver' good grub. I think sorry for my fam'ly.\nNo, no, senora, I no work no more that Marionette, I stay with my\nfam'ly.\" The wonder of it is, I think, that the family had the same\npoint of view.\n\nEvery house in the town of the vines has its garden plot, corn and brown\nbeans and a row of peppers reddening in the sun; and in damp borders\nof the irrigating ditches clumps of yerbasanta, horehound, catnip, and\nspikenard, wholesome herbs and curative, but if no peppers then nothing\nat all. You will have for a holiday dinner, in Las Uvas, soup with meat\nballs and chile in it, chicken with chile, rice with chile, fried beans\nwith more chile, enchilada, which is corn cake with the sauce of chile\nand tomatoes, onion, grated cheese, and olives, and for a relish\nchile tepines passed about in a dish, all of which is comfortable and\ncorrective to the stomach. You will have wine which every man makes for\nhimself, of good body and inimitable bouquet, and sweets that are not\nnearly so nice as they look.\n\nThere are two occasions when you may count on that kind of a meal;\nalways on the Sixteenth of September, and on the two-yearly visits of\nFather Shannon. It is absurd, of course, that El Pueblo de Las Uvas\nshould have an Irish priest, but Black Rock, Minton, Jimville, and all\nthat country round do not find it so. Father Shannon visits them all,\nwaits by the Red Butte to confess the shepherds who go through with\ntheir flocks, carries blessing to small and isolated mines, and so in\nthe course of a year or so works around to Las Uvas to bury and marry\nand christen. Then all the little graves in the Campo Santo are brave\nwith tapers, the brown pine headboards blossom like Aaron's rod with\npaper roses and bright cheap prints of Our Lady of Sorrows. Then the\nSenora Sevadra, who thinks herself elect of heaven for that office,\ngathers up the original sinners, the little Elijias, Lolas, Manuelitas,\nJoses, and Felipes, by dint of adjurations and sweets smuggled into\nsmall perspiring palms, to fit them for the Sacrament.\n\nI used to peek in at them, never so softly, in Dona Ina's living-room;\nRaphael-eyed little imps, going sidewise on their knees to rest them\nfrom the bare floor, candles lit on the mantel to give a religious air,\nand a great sheaf of wild bloom before the Holy Family. Come Sunday they\nset out the altar in the schoolhouse, with the fine-drawn altar cloths,\nthe beaten silver candlesticks, and the wax images, chief glory of Las\nUvas, brought up mule-back from Old Mexico forty years ago. All in white\nthe communicants go up two and two in a hushed, sweet awe to take the\nbody of their Lord, and Tomaso, who is priest's boy, tries not to look\nunduly puffed up by his office. After that you have dinner and a bottle\nof wine that ripened on the sunny slope of Escondito. All the week\nFather Shannon has shriven his people, who bring clean conscience to\nthe betterment of appetite, and the Father sets them an example. Father\nShannon is rather big about the middle to accommodate the large laugh\nthat lives in him, but a most shrewd searcher of hearts. It is reported\nthat one derives comfort from his confessional, and I for my part\nbelieve it.\n\nThe celebration of the Sixteenth, though it comes every year, takes as\nlong to prepare for as Holy Communion. The senoritas have each a new\ndress apiece, the senoras a new rebosa. The young gentlemen have\nnew silver trimmings to their sombreros, unspeakable ties, silk\nhandkerchiefs, and new leathers to their spurs. At this time when the\npeppers glow in the gardens and the young quail cry \"cuidado,\" \"have a\ncare!\" you can hear the plump, plump of the metate from the alcoves of\nthe vines where comfortable old dames, whose experience gives them the\ntouch of art, are pounding out corn for tamales.\n\nSchool-teachers from abroad have tried before now at Las Uvas to have\nschool begin on the first of September, but got nothing else to stir\nin the heads of the little Castros, Garcias, and Romeros but feasts and\ncock-fights until after the Sixteenth. Perhaps you need to be told that\nthis is the anniversary of the Republic, when liberty awoke and cried\nin the provinces of Old Mexico. You are aroused at midnight to hear them\nshouting in the streets, \"Vive la Libertad!\" answered from the houses\nand the recesses of the vines, \"Vive la Mexico!\" At sunrise shots are\nfired commemorating the tragedy of unhappy Maximilian, and then music,\nthe noblest of national hymns, as the great flag of Old Mexico floats up\nthe flag-pole in the bare little plaza of shabby Las Uvas. The sun\nover Pine Mountain greets the eagle of Montezuma before it touches the\nvineyards and the town, and the day begins with a great shout. By and\nby there will be a reading of the Declaration of Independence and an\naddress punctured by vives; all the town in its best dress, and some\nexhibits of horsemanship that make lathered bits and bloody spurs; also\na cock-fight.\n\nBy night there will be dancing, and such music! old Santos to play the\nflute, a little lean man with a saintly countenance, young Garcia whose\nguitar has a soul, and Carrasco with the violin. They sit on a high\nplatform above the dancers in the candle flare, backed by the red,\nwhite, and green of Old Mexico, and play fervently such music as you\nwill not hear otherwhere.\n\nAt midnight the flag comes down. Count yourself at a loss if you are\nnot moved by that performance. Pine Mountain watches whitely overhead,\nshepherd fires glow strongly on the glooming hills. The plaza, the bare\nglistening pole, the dark folk, the bright dresses, are lit ruddily by\na bonfire. It leaps up to the eagle flag, dies down, the music begins\nsoftly and aside. They play airs of old longing and exile; slowly out\nof the dark the flag drops down, bellying and falling with the midnight\ndraught. Sometimes a hymn is sung, always there are tears. The flag\nis down; Tony Sevadra has received it in his arms. The music strikes a\nbarbaric swelling tune, another flag begins a slow ascent,--it takes\na breath or two to realize that they are both, flag and tune, the Star\nSpangled Banner,--a volley is fired, we are back, if you please, in\nCalifornia of America. Every youth who has the blood of patriots in him\nlays ahold on Tony Sevadra's flag, happiest if he can get a corner of\nit. The music goes before, the folk fall in two and two, singing. They\nsing everything, America, the Marseillaise, for the sake of the French\nshepherds hereabout, the hymn of Cuba, and the Chilian national air to\ncomfort two families of that land. The flag goes to Dona Ina's, with the\ncandlesticks and the altar cloths, then Las Uvas eats tamales and dances\nthe sun up the slope of Pine Mountain.\n\nYou are not to suppose that they do not keep the Fourth, Washington's\nBirthday, and Thanksgiving at the town of the grape vines. These make\nexcellent occasions for quitting work and dancing, but the Sixteenth is\nthe holiday of the heart. On Memorial Day the graves have garlands and\nnew pictures of the saints tacked to the headboards. There is great\nvirtue in an Ave said in the Camp of the Saints. I like that name which\nthe Spanish speaking people give to the garden of the dead, Campo Santo,\nas if it might be some bed of healing from which blind souls and sinners\nrise up whole and praising God. Sometimes the speech of simple folk\nhints at truth the understanding does not reach. I am persuaded only a\ncomplex soul can get any good of a plain religion. Your earthborn is a\npoet and a symbolist. We breed in an environment of asphalt pavements\na body of people whose creeds are chiefly restrictions against other\npeople's way of life, and have kitchens and latrines under the same roof\nthat houses their God. Such as these go to church to be edified, but at\nLas Uvas they go for pure worship and to entreat their God. The logical\nconclusion of the faith that every good gift cometh from God is the open\nhand and the finer courtesy. The meal done without buys a candle for the\nneighbor's dead child. You do foolishly to suppose that the candle does\nno good.\n\nAt Las Uvas every house is a piece of earth--thick walled, whitewashed\nadobe that keeps the even temperature of a cave; every man is an\naccomplished horseman and consequently bowlegged; every family keeps\ndogs, flea-bitten mongrels that loll on the earthen floors. They speak\na purer Castilian than obtains in like villages of Mexico, and the way\nthey count relationship everybody is more or less akin. There is not\nmuch villainy among them. What incentive to thieving or killing\ncan there be when there is little wealth and that to be had for the\nborrowing! If they love too hotly, as we say \"take their meat before\ngrace,\" so do their betters. Eh, what! shall a man be a saint before he\nis dead? And besides, Holy Church takes it out of you one way or another\nbefore all is done. Come away, you who are obsessed with your own\nimportance in the scheme of things, and have got nothing you did not\nsweat for, come away by the brown valleys and full-bosomed hills to the\neven-breathing days, to the kindliness, earthiness, ease of El Pueblo de\nLas Uvas.",
