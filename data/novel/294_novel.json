Still\nlying-to amid enormous ice fields. The one which stretches away to the\nnorth of us, and to which our ice-anchor is attached, cannot be smaller\nthan an English county. To the right and left unbroken sheets extend\nto the horizon. This morning the mate reported that there were signs of\npack ice to the southward. Should this form of sufficient thickness\nto bar our return, we shall be in a position of danger, as the food, I\nhear, is already running somewhat short. It is late in the season, and\nthe nights are beginning to reappear.\n\nThis morning I saw a star twinkling just over the fore-yard, the first\nsince the beginning of May. There is considerable discontent among the\ncrew, many of whom are anxious to get back home to be in time for the\nherring season, when labour always commands a high price upon the Scotch\ncoast. As yet their displeasure is only signified by sullen countenances\nand black looks, but I heard from the second mate this afternoon that\nthey contemplated sending a deputation to the Captain to explain their\ngrievance. I much doubt how he will receive it, as he is a man of fierce\ntemper, and very sensitive about anything approaching to an infringement\nof his rights. I shall venture after dinner to say a few words to him\nupon the subject. I have always found that he will tolerate from me what\nhe would resent from any other member of the crew. Amsterdam Island,\nat the north-west corner of Spitzbergen, is visible upon our starboard\nquarter--a rugged line of volcanic rocks, intersected by white seams,\nwhich represent glaciers. It is curious to think that at the present\nmoment there is probably no human being nearer to us than the Danish\nsettlements in the south of Greenland--a good nine hundred miles as the\ncrow flies. A captain takes a great responsibility upon himself when he\nrisks his vessel under such circumstances. No whaler has ever remained\nin these latitudes till so advanced a period of the year.\n\n9 P.M,--I have spoken to Captain Craigie, and though the result has been\nhardly satisfactory, I am bound to say that he listened to what I had to\nsay very quietly and even deferentially. When I had finished he put on\nthat air of iron determination which I have frequently observed upon his\nface, and paced rapidly backwards and forwards across the narrow cabin\nfor some minutes. At first I feared that I had seriously offended him,\nbut he dispelled the idea by sitting down again, and putting his hand\nupon my arm with a gesture which almost amounted to a caress. There\nwas a depth of tenderness too in his wild dark eyes which surprised\nme considerably. “Look here, Doctor,” he said, “I’m sorry I ever took\nyou--I am indeed--and I would give fifty pounds this minute to see you\nstanding safe upon the Dundee quay. It’s hit or miss with me this time.\nThere are fish to the north of us. How dare you shake your head, sir,\nwhen I tell you I saw them blowing from the masthead?”--this in a sudden\nburst of fury, though I was not conscious of having shown any signs of\ndoubt. “Two-and-twenty fish in as many minutes as I am a living man,\nand not one under ten foot.[1] Now, Doctor, do you think I can leave the\ncountry when there is only one infernal strip of ice between me and my\nfortune? If it came on to blow from the north to-morrow we could fill\nthe ship and be away before the frost could catch us. If it came on to\nblow from the south--well, I suppose the men are paid for risking their\nlives, and as for myself it matters but little to me, for I have more to\nbind me to the other world than to this one. I confess that I am sorry\nfor you, though. I wish I had old Angus Tait who was with me last\nvoyage, for he was a man that would never be missed, and you--you said\nonce that you were engaged, did you not?”\n\n\n[Footnote 1: A whale is measured among whalers not by the length of its\nbody, but by the length of its whalebone.]\n\n\n“Yes,” I answered, snapping the spring of the locket which hung from my\nwatch-chain, and holding up the little vignette of Flora.\n\n“Curse you!” he yelled, springing out of his seat, with his very beard\nbristling with passion. “What is your happiness to me? What have I to do\nwith her that you must dangle her photograph before my eyes?” I almost\nthought that he was about to strike me in the frenzy of his rage, but\nwith another imprecation he dashed open the door of the cabin and rushed\nout upon deck, leaving me considerably astonished at his extraordinary\nviolence. It is the first time that he has ever shown me anything but\ncourtesy and kindness. I can hear him pacing excitedly up and down\noverhead as I write these lines.\n\nI should like to give a sketch of the character of this man, but it\nseems presumptuous to attempt such a thing upon paper, when the idea in\nmy own mind is at best a vague and uncertain one. Several times I have\nthought that I grasped the clue which might explain it, but only to be\ndisappointed by his presenting himself in some new light which would\nupset all my conclusions. It may be that no human eye but my own shall\never rest upon these lines, yet as a psychological study I shall attempt\nto leave some record of Captain Nicholas Craigie.\n\nA man’s outer case generally gives some indication of the soul within.\nThe Captain is tall and well-formed, with dark, handsome face, and a\ncurious way of twitching his limbs, which may arise from nervousness, or\nbe simply an outcome of his excessive energy. His jaw and whole cast\nof countenance is manly and resolute, but the eyes are the distinctive\nfeature of his face. They are of the very darkest hazel, bright and\neager, with a singular mixture of recklessness in their expression, and\nof something else which I have sometimes thought was more allied with\nhorror than any other emotion. Generally the former predominated, but on\noccasions, and more particularly when he was thoughtfully inclined, the\nlook of fear would spread and deepen until it imparted a new character\nto his whole countenance. It is at these times that he is most subject\nto tempestuous fits of anger, and he seems to be aware of it, for I have\nknown him lock himself up so that no one might approach him until his\ndark hour was passed. He sleeps badly, and I have heard him shouting\nduring the night, but his cabin is some little distance from mine, and I\ncould never distinguish the words which he said.\n\nThis is one phase of his character, and the most disagreeable one. It\nis only through my close association with him, thrown together as we\nare day after day, that I have observed it. Otherwise he is an agreeable\ncompanion, well-read and entertaining, and as gallant a seaman as ever\ntrod a deck. I shall not easily forget the way in which he handled the\nship when we were caught by a gale among the loose ice at the beginning\nof April. I have never seen him so cheerful, and even hilarious, as he\nwas that night, as he paced backwards and forwards upon the bridge amid\nthe flashing of the lightning and the howling of the wind. He has told\nme several times that the thought of death was a pleasant one to him,\nwhich is a sad thing for a young man to say; he cannot be much more than\nthirty, though his hair and moustache are already slightly grizzled.\nSome great sorrow must have overtaken him and blighted his whole life.\nPerhaps I should be the same if I lost my Flora--God knows! I think if\nit were not for her that I should care very little whether the wind blew\nfrom the north or the south to-morrow.\n\nThere, I hear him come down the companion, and he has locked himself up\nin his room, which shows that he is still in an unamiable mood. And so\nto bed, as old Pepys would say, for the candle is burning down (we have\nto use them now since the nights are closing in), and the steward has\nturned in, so there are no hopes of another one.\n\nSeptember 12th.--Calm, clear day, and still lying in the same position.\nWhat wind there is comes from the south-east, but it is very slight.\nCaptain is in a better humour, and apologised to me at breakfast for his\nrudeness. He still looks somewhat distrait, however, and retains that\nwild look in his eyes which in a Highlander would mean that he was\n“fey”--at least so our chief engineer remarked to me, and he has some\nreputation among the Celtic portion of our crew as a seer and expounder\nof omens.\n\nIt is strange that superstition should have obtained such mastery over\nthis hard-headed and practical race. I could not have believed to what\nan extent it is carried had I not observed it for myself. We have had a\nperfect epidemic of it this voyage, until I have felt inclined to serve\nout rations of sedatives and nerve-tonics with the Saturday allowance\nof grog. The first symptom of it was that shortly after leaving Shetland\nthe men at the wheel used to complain that they heard plaintive cries\nand screams in the wake of the ship, as if something were following it\nand were unable to overtake it. This fiction has been kept up during the\nwhole voyage, and on dark nights at the beginning of the seal-fishing\nit was only with great difficulty that men could be induced to do\ntheir spell. No doubt what they heard was either the creaking of the\nrudder-chains, or the cry of some passing sea-bird. I have been fetched\nout of bed several times to listen to it, but I need hardly say that I\nwas never able to distinguish anything unnatural.\n\nThe men, however, are so absurdly positive upon the subject that it is\nhopeless to argue with them. I mentioned the matter to the Captain once,\nbut to my surprise he took it very gravely, and indeed appeared to be\nconsiderably disturbed by what I told him. I should have thought that he\nat least would have been above such vulgar delusions.\n\nAll this disquisition upon superstition leads me up to the fact that Mr.\nManson, our second mate, saw a ghost last night--or, at least, says that\nhe did, which of course is the same thing. It is quite refreshing to\nhave some new topic of conversation after the eternal routine of bears\nand whales which has served us for so many months. Manson swears the\nship is haunted, and that he would not stay in her a day if he had any\nother place to go to. Indeed the fellow is honestly frightened, and I\nhad to give him some chloral and bromide of potassium this morning to\nsteady him down. He seemed quite indignant when I suggested that he had\nbeen having an extra glass the night before, and I was obliged to pacify\nhim by keeping as grave a countenance as possible during his\nstory, which he certainly narrated in a very straight-forward and\nmatter-of-fact way.\n\n“I was on the bridge,” he said, “about four bells in the middle watch,\njust when the night was at its darkest. There was a bit of a moon, but\nthe clouds were blowing across it so that you couldn’t see far from the\nship. John M’Leod, the harpooner, came aft from the foc’sle-head and\nreported a strange noise on the starboard bow.\n\n“I went forrard and we both heard it, sometimes like a bairn crying and\nsometimes like a wench in pain. I’ve been seventeen years to the country\nand I never heard seal, old or young, make a sound like that. As we\nwere standing there on the foc’sle-head the moon came out from behind\na cloud, and we both saw a sort of white figure moving across the ice\nfield in the same direction that we had heard the cries. We lost sight\nof it for a while, but it came back on the port bow, and we could just\nmake it out like a shadow on the ice. I sent a hand aft for the rifles,\nand M’Leod and I went down on to the pack, thinking that maybe it might\nbe a bear. When we got on the ice I lost sight of M’Leod, but I pushed\non in the direction where I could still hear the cries. I followed them\nfor a mile or maybe more, and then running round a hummock I came right\non to the top of it standing and waiting for me seemingly. I don’t\nknow what it was. It wasn’t a bear any way. It was tall and white and\nstraight, and if it wasn’t a man nor a woman, I’ll stake my davy it\nwas something worse. I made for the ship as hard as I could run, and\nprecious glad I was to find myself aboard. I signed articles to do my\nduty by the ship, and on the ship I’ll stay, but you don’t catch me on\nthe ice again after sundown.”\n\nThat is his story, given as far as I can in his own words. I fancy what\nhe saw must, in spite of his denial, have been a young bear erect upon\nits hind legs, an attitude which they often assume when alarmed. In\nthe uncertain light this would bear a resemblance to a human figure,\nespecially to a man whose nerves were already somewhat shaken. Whatever\nit may have been, the occurrence is unfortunate, for it has produced a\nmost unpleasant effect upon the crew. Their looks are more sullen than\nbefore, and their discontent more open. The double grievance of being\ndebarred from the herring fishing and of being detained in what they\nchoose to call a haunted vessel, may lead them to do something rash.\nEven the harpooners, who are the oldest and steadiest among them, are\njoining in the general agitation.\n\nApart from this absurd outbreak of superstition, things are looking\nrather more cheerful. The pack which was forming to the south of us has\npartly cleared away, and the water is so warm as to lead me to believe\nthat we are lying in one of those branches of the gulf-stream which run\nup between Greenland and Spitzbergen. There are numerous small Medusae\nand sealemons about the ship, with abundance of shrimps, so that there\nis every possibility of “fish” being sighted. Indeed one was seen\nblowing about dinner-time, but in such a position that it was impossible\nfor the boats to follow it.\n\nSeptember 13th.--Had an interesting conversation with the chief mate,\nMr. Milne, upon the bridge. It seems that our Captain is as great an\nenigma to the seamen, and even to the owners of the vessel, as he has\nbeen to me. Mr. Milne tells me that when the ship is paid off, upon\nreturning from a voyage, Captain Craigie disappears, and is not seen\nagain until the approach of another season, when he walks quietly\ninto the office of the company, and asks whether his services will be\nrequired. He has no friend in Dundee, nor does any one pretend to be\nacquainted with his early history. His position depends entirely upon\nhis skill as a seaman, and the name for courage and coolness which\nhe had earned in the capacity of mate, before being entrusted with a\nseparate command. The unanimous opinion seems to be that he is not a\nScotchman, and that his name is an assumed one. Mr. Milne thinks that he\nhas devoted himself to whaling simply for the reason that it is the most\ndangerous occupation which he could select, and that he courts death in\nevery possible manner. He mentioned several instances of this, one of\nwhich is rather curious, if true. It seems that on one occasion he\ndid not put in an appearance at the office, and a substitute had to\nbe selected in his place. That was at the time of the last Russian and\nTurkish war. When he turned up again next spring he had a puckered wound\nin the side of his neck which he used to endeavour to conceal with his\ncravat. Whether the mate’s inference that he had been engaged in the war\nis true or not I cannot say. It was certainly a strange coincidence.\n\nThe wind is veering round in an easterly direction, but is still very\nslight. I think the ice is lying closer than it did yesterday. As far\nas the eye can reach on every side there is one wide expanse of spotless\nwhite, only broken by an occasional rift or the dark shadow of a\nhummock. To the south there is the narrow lane of blue water which is\nour sole means of escape, and which is closing up every day. The Captain\nis taking a heavy responsibility upon himself. I hear that the tank of\npotatoes has been finished, and even the biscuits are running short,\nbut he preserves the same impassible countenance, and spends the greater\npart of the day at the crow’s nest, sweeping the horizon with his glass.\nHis manner is very variable, and he seems to avoid my society, but there\nhas been no repetition of the violence which he showed the other night.\n\n7.30 P.M.--My deliberate opinion is that we are commanded by a madman.\nNothing else can account for the extraordinary vagaries of Captain\nCraigie. It is fortunate that I have kept this journal of our voyage, as\nit will serve to justify us in case we have to put him under any sort\nof restraint, a step which I should only consent to as a last resource.\nCuriously enough it was he himself who suggested lunacy and not mere\neccentricity as the secret of his strange conduct. He was standing upon\nthe bridge about an hour ago, peering as usual through his glass, while\nI was walking up and down the quarterdeck. The majority of the men were\nbelow at their tea, for the watches have not been regularly kept of\nlate. Tired of walking, I leaned against the bulwarks, and admired the\nmellow glow cast by the sinking sun upon the great ice fields which\nsurround us. I was suddenly aroused from the reverie into which I had\nfallen by a hoarse voice at my elbow, and starting round I found that\nthe Captain had descended and was standing by my side. He was staring\nout over the ice with an expression in which horror, surprise, and\nsomething approaching to joy were contending for the mastery. In\nspite of the cold, great drops of perspiration were coursing down his\nforehead, and he was evidently fearfully excited.\n\nHis limbs twitched like those of a man upon the verge of an epileptic\nfit, and the lines about his mouth were drawn and hard.\n\n“Look!” he gasped, seizing me by the wrist, but still keeping his\neyes upon the distant ice, and moving his head slowly in a horizontal\ndirection, as if following some object which was moving across the field\nof vision. “Look! There, man, there! Between the hummocks! Now coming\nout from behind the far one! You see her--you MUST see her! There still!\nFlying from me, by God, flying from me--and gone!”\n\nHe uttered the last two words in a whisper of concentrated agony which\nshall never fade from my remembrance. Clinging to the ratlines he\nendeavoured to climb up upon the top of the bulwarks as if in the hope\nof obtaining a last glance at the departing object. His strength was not\nequal to the attempt, however, and he staggered back against the saloon\nskylights, where he leaned panting and exhausted. His face was so livid\nthat I expected him to become unconscious, so lost no time in leading\nhim down the companion, and stretching him upon one of the sofas in the\ncabin. I then poured him out some brandy, which I held to his lips, and\nwhich had a wonderful effect upon him, bringing the blood back into his\nwhite face and steadying his poor shaking limbs. He raised himself up\nupon his elbow, and looking round to see that we were alone, he beckoned\nto me to come and sit beside him.\n\n“You saw it, didn’t you?” he asked, still in the same subdued awesome\ntone so foreign to the nature of the man.\n\n“No, I saw nothing.”\n\nHis head sank back again upon the cushions. “No, he wouldn’t without the\nglass,” he murmured. “He couldn’t. It was the glass that showed her to\nme, and then the eyes of love--the eyes of love.\n\n“I say, Doc, don’t let the steward in! He’ll think I’m mad. Just bolt the\ndoor, will you!”\n\nI rose and did what he had commanded.\n\nHe lay quiet for a while, lost in thought apparently, and then raised\nhimself up upon his elbow again, and asked for some more brandy.\n\n“You don’t think I am, do you, Doc?” he asked, as I was putting the\nbottle back into the after-locker. “Tell me now, as man to man, do you\nthink that I am mad?”\n\n“I think you have something on your mind,” I answered, “which is\nexciting you and doing you a good deal of harm.”\n\n“Right there, lad!” he cried, his eyes sparkling from the effects of the\nbrandy. “Plenty on my mind--plenty! But I can work out the latitude and\nthe longitude, and I can handle my sextant and manage my logarithms. You\ncouldn’t prove me mad in a court of law, could you, now?” It was curious\nto hear the man lying back and coolly arguing out the question of his\nown sanity.\n\n“Perhaps not,” I said; “but still I think you would be wise to get home\nas soon as you can, and settle down to a quiet life for a while.”\n\n“Get home, eh?” he muttered, with a sneer upon his face. “One word for\nme and two for yourself, lad. Settle down with Flora--pretty little\nFlora. Are bad dreams signs of madness?”\n\n“Sometimes,” I answered.\n\n“What else? What would be the first symptoms?”\n\n“Pains in the head, noises in the ears flashes before the eyes,\ndelusions”----\n\n“Ah! what about them?” he interrupted. “What would you call a delusion?”\n\n“Seeing a thing which is not there is a delusion.”\n\n“But she WAS there!” he groaned to himself. “She WAS there!” and rising,\nhe unbolted the door and walked with slow and uncertain steps to his\nown cabin, where I have no doubt that he will remain until to-morrow\nmorning. His system seems to have received a terrible shock, whatever it\nmay have been that he imagined himself to have seen. The man becomes a\ngreater mystery every day, though I fear that the solution which he has\nhimself suggested is the correct one, and that his reason is affected.\nI do not think that a guilty conscience has anything to do with his\nbehaviour. The idea is a popular one among the officers, and, I believe,\nthe crew; but I have seen nothing to support it. He has not the air of\na guilty man, but of one who has had terrible usage at the hands of\nfortune, and who should be regarded as a martyr rather than a criminal.\n\nThe wind is veering round to the south to-night. God help us if it\nblocks that narrow pass which is our only road to safety! Situated as\nwe are on the edge of the main Arctic pack, or the “barrier” as it\nis called by the whalers, any wind from the north has the effect of\nshredding out the ice around us and allowing our escape, while a wind\nfrom the south blows up all the loose ice behind us and hems us in\nbetween two packs. God help us, I say again!\n\nSeptember 14th.--Sunday, and a day of rest. My fears have been\nconfirmed, and the thin strip of blue water has disappeared from the\nsouthward. Nothing but the great motionless ice fields around us, with\ntheir weird hummocks and fantastic pinnacles. There is a deathly silence\nover their wide expanse which is horrible. No lapping of the waves\nnow, no cries of seagulls or straining of sails, but one deep universal\nsilence in which the murmurs of the seamen, and the creak of their boots\nupon the white shining deck, seem discordant and out of place. Our only\nvisitor was an Arctic fox, a rare animal upon the pack, though common\nenough upon the land. He did not come near the ship, however, but after\nsurveying us from a distance fled rapidly across the ice. This was\ncurious conduct, as they generally know nothing of man, and being of an\ninquisitive nature, become so familiar that they are easily captured.\nIncredible as it may seem, even this little incident produced a bad\neffect upon the crew. “Yon puir beastie kens mair, ay, an’ sees mair nor\nyou nor me!” was the comment of one of the leading harpooners, and the\nothers nodded their acquiescence. It is vain to attempt to argue against\nsuch puerile superstition. They have made up their minds that there is\na curse upon the ship, and nothing will ever persuade them to the\ncontrary.\n\nThe Captain remained in seclusion all day except for about half an hour\nin the afternoon, when he came out upon the quarterdeck. I observed that\nhe kept his eye fixed upon the spot where the vision of yesterday had\nappeared, and was quite prepared for another outburst, but none such\ncame. He did not seem to see me although I was standing close beside\nhim. Divine service was read as usual by the chief engineer. It is a\ncurious thing that in whaling vessels the Church of England Prayer-book\nis always employed, although there is never a member of that Church\namong either officers or crew. Our men are all Roman Catholics or\nPresbyterians, the former predominating. Since a ritual is used which\nis foreign to both, neither can complain that the other is preferred\nto them, and they listen with all attention and devotion, so that the\nsystem has something to recommend it.\n\nA glorious sunset, which made the great fields of ice look like a lake\nof blood. I have never seen a finer and at the same time more weird\neffect. Wind is veering round. If it will blow twenty-four hours from\nthe north all will yet be well.\n\nSeptember 15th.--To-day is Flora’s birthday. Dear lass! it is well that\nshe cannot see her boy, as she used to call me, shut up among the ice\nfields with a crazy captain and a few weeks’ provisions. No doubt she\nscans the shipping list in the Scotsman every morning to see if we are\nreported from Shetland. I have to set an example to the men and look\ncheery and unconcerned; but God knows, my heart is very heavy at times.\n\nThe thermometer is at nineteen Fahrenheit to-day. There is but little\nwind, and what there is comes from an unfavourable quarter. Captain is\nin an excellent humour; I think he imagines he has seen some other omen\nor vision, poor fellow, during the night, for he came into my room early\nin the morning, and stooping down over my bunk, whispered, “It wasn’t a\ndelusion, Doc; it’s all right!” After breakfast he asked me to find out\nhow much food was left, which the second mate and I proceeded to do. It\nis even less than we had expected. Forward they have half a tank full\nof biscuits, three barrels of salt meat, and a very limited supply of\ncoffee beans and sugar. In the after-hold and lockers there are a good\nmany luxuries, such as tinned salmon, soups, haricot mutton, &c., but\nthey will go a very short way among a crew of fifty men. There are two\nbarrels of flour in the store-room, and an unlimited supply of tobacco.\nAltogether there is about enough to keep the men on half rations for\neighteen or twenty days--certainly not more. When we reported the\nstate of things to the Captain, he ordered all hands to be piped,\nand addressed them from the quarterdeck. I never saw him to better\nadvantage. With his tall, well-knit figure, and dark animated face, he\nseemed a man born to command, and he discussed the situation in a cool\nsailor-like way which showed that while appreciating the danger he had\nan eye for every loophole of escape.\n\n“My lads,” he said, “no doubt you think I brought you into this fix, if\nit is a fix, and maybe some of you feel bitter against me on account of\nit. But you must remember that for many a season no ship that comes to\nthe country has brought in as much oil-money as the old Pole-Star,\nand every one of you has had his share of it. You can leave your wives\nbehind you in comfort while other poor fellows come back to find their\nlasses on the parish. If you have to thank me for the one you have to\nthank me for the other, and we may call it quits. We’ve tried a bold\nventure before this and succeeded, so now that we’ve tried one and\nfailed we’ve no cause to cry out about it. If the worst comes to the\nworst, we can make the land across the ice, and lay in a stock of\nseals which will keep us alive until the spring. It won’t come to that,\nthough, for you’ll see the Scotch coast again before three weeks are\nout. At present every man must go on half rations, share and share\nalike, and no favour to any. Keep up your hearts and you’ll pull through\nthis as you’ve pulled through many a danger before.” These few\nsimple words of his had a wonderful effect upon the crew. His former\nunpopularity was forgotten, and the old harpooner whom I have already\nmentioned for his superstition, led off three cheers, which were\nheartily joined in by all hands.\n\nSeptember 16th.--The wind has veered round to the north during the\nnight, and the ice shows some symptoms of opening out. The men are in\na good humour in spite of the short allowance upon which they have been\nplaced. Steam is kept up in the engine-room, that there may be no delay\nshould an opportunity for escape present itself. The Captain is in\nexuberant spirits, though he still retains that wild “fey” expression\nwhich I have already remarked upon. This burst of cheerfulness puzzles\nme more than his former gloom. I cannot understand it. I think I\nmentioned in an early part of this journal that one of his oddities is\nthat he never permits any person to enter his cabin, but insists upon\nmaking his own bed, such as it is, and performing every other office for\nhimself. To my surprise he handed me the key to-day and requested me to\ngo down there and take the time by his chronometer while he measured\nthe altitude of the sun at noon. It is a bare little room, containing\na washing-stand and a few books, but little else in the way of luxury,\nexcept some pictures upon the walls. The majority of these are small\ncheap oleographs, but there was one water-colour sketch of the head of a\nyoung lady which arrested my attention. It was evidently a portrait, and\nnot one of those fancy types of female beauty which sailors particularly\naffect. No artist could have evolved from his own mind such a curious\nmixture of character and weakness. The languid, dreamy eyes, with their\ndrooping lashes, and the broad, low brow, unruffled by thought or care,\nwere in strong contrast with the clean-cut, prominent jaw, and the\nresolute set of the lower lip. Underneath it in one of the corners was\nwritten, “M. B., aet. 19.” That any one in the short space of nineteen\nyears of existence could develop such strength of will as was stamped\nupon her face seemed to me at the time to be well-nigh incredible. She\nmust have been an extraordinary woman. Her features have thrown such\na glamour over me that, though I had but a fleeting glance at them, I\ncould, were I a draughtsman, reproduce them line for line upon this page\nof the journal. I wonder what part she has played in our Captain’s\nlife. He has hung her picture at the end of his berth, so that his eyes\ncontinually rest upon it. Were he a less reserved man I should make\nsome remark upon the subject. Of the other things in his cabin there\nwas nothing worthy of mention--uniform coats, a camp-stool, small\nlooking-glass, tobacco-box, and numerous pipes, including an oriental\nhookah--which, by-the-bye, gives some colour to Mr. Milne’s story about\nhis participation in the war, though the connection may seem rather a\ndistant one.\n\n11.20 P.M.--Captain just gone to bed after a long and interesting\nconversation on general topics. When he chooses he can be a most\nfascinating companion, being remarkably well-read, and having the power\nof expressing his opinion forcibly without appearing to be dogmatic. I\nhate to have my intellectual toes trod upon. He spoke about the nature\nof the soul, and sketched out the views of Aristotle and Plato upon\nthe subject in a masterly manner. He seems to have a leaning for\nmetempsychosis and the doctrines of Pythagoras. In discussing them we\ntouched upon modern spiritualism, and I made some joking allusion to\nthe impostures of Slade, upon which, to my surprise, he warned me most\nimpressively against confusing the innocent with the guilty, and argued\nthat it would be as logical to brand Christianity as an error because\nJudas, who professed that religion, was a villain. He shortly afterwards\nbade me good-night and retired to his room.\n\nThe wind is freshening up, and blows steadily from the north. The nights\nare as dark now as they are in England. I hope to-morrow may set us free\nfrom our frozen fetters.\n\nSeptember 17th.--The Bogie again. Thank Heaven that I have strong\nnerves! The superstition of these poor fellows, and the circumstantial\naccounts which they give, with the utmost earnestness and\nself-conviction, would horrify any man not accustomed to their ways.\nThere are many versions of the matter, but the sum-total of them all is\nthat something uncanny has been flitting round the ship all night,\nand that Sandie M’Donald of Peterhead and “lang” Peter Williamson of\nShetland saw it, as also did Mr. Milne on the bridge--so, having three\nwitnesses, they can make a better case of it than the second mate did.\nI spoke to Milne after breakfast, and told him that he should be above\nsuch nonsense, and that as an officer he ought to set the men a better\nexample. He shook his weather-beaten head ominously, but answered with\ncharacteristic caution, “Mebbe aye, mebbe na, Doctor,” he said; “I didna\nca’ it a ghaist. I canna’ say I preen my faith in sea-bogles an’ the\nlike, though there’s a mony as claims to ha’ seen a’ that and waur. I’m\nno easy feared, but maybe your ain bluid would run a bit cauld, mun, if\ninstead o’ speerin’ aboot it in daylicht ye were wi’ me last night, an’\nseed an awfu’ like shape, white an’ gruesome, whiles here, whiles there,\nan’ it greetin’ and ca’ing in the darkness like a bit lambie that hae\nlost its mither. Ye would na’ be sae ready to put it a’ doon to auld\nwives’ clavers then, I’m thinkin’.” I saw it was hopeless to reason with\nhim, so contented myself with begging him as a personal favour to call\nme up the next time the spectre appeared--a request to which he acceded\nwith many ejaculations expressive of his hopes that such an opportunity\nmight never arise.\n\nAs I had hoped, the white desert behind us has become broken by many\nthin streaks of water which intersect it in all directions. Our latitude\nto-day was 80 degrees 52’ N., which shows that there is a strong\nsoutherly drift upon the pack. Should the wind continue favourable it\nwill break up as rapidly as it formed. At present we can do nothing but\nsmoke and wait and hope for the best. I am rapidly becoming a fatalist.\nWhen dealing with such uncertain factors as wind and ice a man can be\nnothing else. Perhaps it was the wind and sand of the Arabian deserts\nwhich gave the minds of the original followers of Mahomet their tendency\nto bow to kismet.\n\nThese spectral alarms have a very bad effect upon the Captain. I feared\nthat it might excite his sensitive mind, and endeavoured to conceal the\nabsurd story from him, but unfortunately he overheard one of the men\nmaking an allusion to it, and insisted upon being informed about it. As\nI had expected, it brought out all his latent lunacy in an exaggerated\nform. I can hardly believe that this is the same man who discoursed\nphilosophy last night with the most critical acumen and coolest\njudgment. He is pacing backwards and forwards upon the quarterdeck like\na caged tiger, stopping now and again to throw out his hands with a\nyearning gesture, and stare impatiently out over the ice. He keeps up a\ncontinual mutter to himself, and once he called out, “But a little time,\nlove--but a little time!” Poor fellow, it is sad to see a gallant seaman\nand accomplished gentleman reduced to such a pass, and to think that\nimagination and delusion can cow a mind to which real danger was but the\nsalt of life. Was ever a man in such a position as I, between a demented\ncaptain and a ghost-seeing mate? I sometimes think I am the only really\nsane man aboard the vessel--except perhaps the second engineer, who is\na kind of ruminant, and would care nothing for all the fiends in the Red\nSea so long as they would leave him alone and not disarrange his tools.\n\nThe ice is still opening rapidly, and there is every probability of\nour being able to make a start to-morrow morning. They will think I\nam inventing when I tell them at home all the strange things that have\nbefallen me.\n\n12 P.M.--I have been a good deal startled, though I feel steadier now,\nthanks to a stiff glass of brandy. I am hardly myself yet, however, as\nthis handwriting will testify. The fact is, that I have gone through\na very strange experience, and am beginning to doubt whether I was\njustified in branding every one on board as madmen because they\nprofessed to have seen things which did not seem reasonable to my\nunderstanding. Pshaw! I am a fool to let such a trifle unnerve me; and\nyet, coming as it does after all these alarms, it has an additional\nsignificance, for I cannot doubt either Mr. Manson’s story or that of\nthe mate, now that I have experienced that which I used formerly to\nscoff at.\n\nAfter all it was nothing very alarming--a mere sound, and that was all.\nI cannot expect that any one reading this, if any one ever should read\nit, will sympathise with my feelings, or realise the effect which it\nproduced upon me at the time. Supper was over, and I had gone on deck\nto have a quiet pipe before turning in. The night was very dark--so dark\nthat, standing under the quarter-boat, I was unable to see the officer\nupon the bridge. I think I have already mentioned the extraordinary\nsilence which prevails in these frozen seas. In other parts of the\nworld, be they ever so barren, there is some slight vibration of the\nair--some faint hum, be it from the distant haunts of men, or from the\nleaves of the trees, or the wings of the birds, or even the faint rustle\nof the grass that covers the ground. One may not actively perceive the\nsound, and yet if it were withdrawn it would be missed. It is only here\nin these Arctic seas that stark, unfathomable stillness obtrudes itself\nupon you in all its gruesome reality. You find your tympanum straining\nto catch some little murmur, and dwelling eagerly upon every accidental\nsound within the vessel. In this state I was leaning against the\nbulwarks when there arose from the ice almost directly underneath me a\ncry, sharp and shrill, upon the silent air of the night, beginning,\nas it seemed to me, at a note such as prima donna never reached, and\nmounting from that ever higher and higher until it culminated in a long\nwail of agony, which might have been the last cry of a lost soul. The\nghastly scream is still ringing in my ears. Grief, unutterable grief,\nseemed to be expressed in it, and a great longing, and yet through it\nall there was an occasional wild note of exultation. It shrilled out\nfrom close beside me, and yet as I glared into the darkness I could\ndiscern nothing. I waited some little time, but without hearing any\nrepetition of the sound, so I came below, more shaken than I have ever\nbeen in my life before. As I came down the companion I met Mr. Milne\ncoming up to relieve the watch. “Weel, Doctor,” he said, “maybe that’s\nauld wives’ clavers tae? Did ye no hear it skirling? Maybe that’s a\nsupersteetion? What d’ye think o’t noo?” I was obliged to apologise to\nthe honest fellow, and acknowledge that I was as puzzled by it as he\nwas. Perhaps to-morrow things may look different. At present I dare\nhardly write all that I think. Reading it again in days to come, when\nI have shaken off all these associations, I should despise myself for\nhaving been so weak.\n\nSeptember 18th.--Passed a restless and uneasy night, still haunted by\nthat strange sound. The Captain does not look as if he had had much\nrepose either, for his face is haggard and his eyes bloodshot. I have\nnot told him of my adventure of last night, nor shall I. He is already\nrestless and excited, standing up, sitting down, and apparently utterly\nunable to keep still.\n\nA fine lead appeared in the pack this morning, as I had expected, and we\nwere able to cast off our ice-anchor, and steam about twelve miles in a\nwest-sou’-westerly direction. We were then brought to a halt by a\ngreat floe as massive as any which we have left behind us. It bars our\nprogress completely, so we can do nothing but anchor again and wait\nuntil it breaks up, which it will probably do within twenty-four hours,\nif the wind holds. Several bladder-nosed seals were seen swimming in the\nwater, and one was shot, an immense creature more than eleven feet long.\nThey are fierce, pugnacious animals, and are said to be more than\na match for a bear. Fortunately they are slow and clumsy in their\nmovements, so that there is little danger in attacking them upon the\nice.\n\nThe Captain evidently does not think we have seen the last of our\ntroubles, though why he should take a gloomy view of the situation is\nmore than I can fathom, since every one else on board considers that we\nhave had a miraculous escape, and are sure now to reach the open sea.\n\n“I suppose you think it’s all right now, Doctor?” he said, as we sat\ntogether after dinner.\n\n“I hope so,” I answered.\n\n“We mustn’t be too sure--and yet no doubt you are right. We’ll all be\nin the arms of our own true loves before long, lad, won’t we? But we\nmustn’t be too sure--we mustn’t be too sure.”\n\nHe sat silent a little, swinging his leg thoughtfully backwards and\nforwards. “Look here,” he continued; “it’s a dangerous place this, even\nat its best--a treacherous, dangerous place. I have known men cut off\nvery suddenly in a land like this. A slip would do it sometimes--a\nsingle slip, and down you go through a crack, and only a bubble on the\ngreen water to show where it was that you sank. It’s a queer thing,”\n he continued with a nervous laugh, “but all the years I’ve been in this\ncountry I never once thought of making a will--not that I have anything\nto leave in particular, but still when a man is exposed to danger he\nshould have everything arranged and ready--don’t you think so?”\n\n“Certainly,” I answered, wondering what on earth he was driving at.\n\n“He feels better for knowing it’s all settled,” he went on. “Now if\nanything should ever befall me, I hope that you will look after things\nfor me. There is very little in the cabin, but such as it is I should\nlike it to be sold, and the money divided in the same proportion as the\noil-money among the crew. The chronometer I wish you to keep yourself\nas some slight remembrance of our voyage. Of course all this is a mere\nprecaution, but I thought I would take the opportunity of speaking\nto you about it. I suppose I might rely upon you if there were any\nnecessity?”\n\n“Most assuredly,” I answered; “and since you are taking this step, I may\nas well”----\n\n“You! you!” he interrupted. “YOU’RE all right. What the devil is the\nmatter with YOU? There, I didn’t mean to be peppery, but I don’t like\nto hear a young fellow, that has hardly began life, speculating about\ndeath. Go up on deck and get some fresh air into your lungs instead of\ntalking nonsense in the cabin, and encouraging me to do the same.”\n\nThe more I think of this conversation of ours the less do I like it. Why\nshould the man be settling his affairs at the very time when we seem to\nbe emerging from all danger? There must be some method in his madness.\nCan it be that he contemplates suicide? I remember that upon one\noccasion he spoke in a deeply reverent manner of the heinousness of the\ncrime of self-destruction. I shall keep my eye upon him, however, and\nthough I cannot obtrude upon the privacy of his cabin, I shall at least\nmake a point of remaining on deck as long as he stays up.\n\nMr. Milne pooh-poohs my fears, and says it is only the “skipper’s little\nway.” He himself takes a very rosy view of the situation. According\nto him we shall be out of the ice by the day after to-morrow, pass Jan\nMeyen two days after that, and sight Shetland in little more than a\nweek. I hope he may not be too sanguine. His opinion may be fairly\nbalanced against the gloomy precautions of the Captain, for he is an old\nand experienced seaman, and weighs his words well before uttering them.\n\n                      *****\n\nThe long-impending catastrophe has come at last. I hardly know what to\nwrite about it. The Captain is gone. He may come back to us again alive,\nbut I fear me--I fear me. It is now seven o’clock of the morning of the\n19th of September. I have spent the whole night traversing the great\nice-floe in front of us with a party of seamen in the hope of coming\nupon some trace of him, but in vain. I shall try to give some account of\nthe circumstances which attended upon his disappearance. Should any\none ever chance to read the words which I put down, I trust they will\nremember that I do not write from conjecture or from hearsay, but that\nI, a sane and educated man, am describing accurately what actually\noccurred before my very eyes. My inferences are my own, but I shall be\nanswerable for the facts.\n\nThe Captain remained in excellent spirits after the conversation which\nI have recorded. He appeared to be nervous and impatient, however,\nfrequently changing his position, and moving his limbs in an aimless\nchoreic way which is characteristic of him at times. In a quarter of an\nhour he went upon deck seven times, only to descend after a few hurried\npaces. I followed him each time, for there was something about his face\nwhich confirmed my resolution of not letting him out of my sight. He\nseemed to observe the effect which his movements had produced, for he\nendeavoured by an over-done hilarity, laughing boisterously at the very\nsmallest of jokes, to quiet my apprehensions.\n\nAfter supper he went on to the poop once more, and I with him. The night\nwas dark and very still, save for the melancholy soughing of the wind\namong the spars. A thick cloud was coming up from the north-west, and the\nragged tentacles which it threw out in front of it were drifting across\nthe face of the moon, which only shone now and again through a rift in\nthe wrack. The Captain paced rapidly backwards and forwards, and then\nseeing me still dogging him, he came across and hinted that he thought\nI should be better below--which, I need hardly say, had the effect of\nstrengthening my resolution to remain on deck.\n\nI think he forgot about my presence after this, for he stood silently\nleaning over the taffrail, and peering out across the great desert of\nsnow, part of which lay in shadow, while part glittered mistily in\nthe moonlight. Several times I could see by his movements that he was\nreferring to his watch, and once he muttered a short sentence, of which\nI could only catch the one word “ready.” I confess to having felt an\neerie feeling creeping over me as I watched the loom of his tall figure\nthrough the darkness, and noted how completely he fulfilled the idea of\na man who is keeping a tryst. A tryst with whom? Some vague perception\nbegan to dawn upon me as I pieced one fact with another, but I was\nutterly unprepared for the sequel.\n\nBy the sudden intensity of his attitude I felt that he saw something.\nI crept up behind him. He was staring with an eager questioning gaze\nat what seemed to be a wreath of mist, blown swiftly in a line with\nthe ship. It was a dim, nebulous body, devoid of shape, sometimes more,\nsometimes less apparent, as the light fell on it. The moon was dimmed\nin its brilliancy at the moment by a canopy of thinnest cloud, like the\ncoating of an anemone.\n\n“Coming, lass, coming,” cried the skipper, in a voice of unfathomable\ntenderness and compassion, like one who soothes a beloved one by some\nfavour long looked for, and as pleasant to bestow as to receive.\n\nWhat followed happened in an instant. I had no power to interfere.\n\nHe gave one spring to the top of the bulwarks, and another which took\nhim on to the ice, almost to the feet of the pale misty figure. He\nheld out his hands as if to clasp it, and so ran into the darkness with\noutstretched arms and loving words. I still stood rigid and motionless,\nstraining my eyes after his retreating form, until his voice died away\nin the distance. I never thought to see him again, but at that moment\nthe moon shone out brilliantly through a chink in the cloudy heaven, and\nilluminated the great field of ice. Then I saw his dark figure already\na very long way off, running with prodigious speed across the frozen\nplain. That was the last glimpse which we caught of him--perhaps\nthe last we ever shall. A party was organised to follow him, and I\naccompanied them, but the men’s hearts were not in the work, and nothing\nwas found. Another will be formed within a few hours. I can hardly\nbelieve I have not been dreaming, or suffering from some hideous\nnightmare, as I write these things down.\n\n7.30 P.M.--Just returned dead beat and utterly tired out from a second\nunsuccessful search for the Captain. The floe is of enormous extent, for\nthough we have traversed at least twenty miles of its surface, there has\nbeen no sign of its coming to an end. The frost has been so severe of\nlate that the overlying snow is frozen as hard as granite, otherwise we\nmight have had the footsteps to guide us. The crew are anxious that we\nshould cast off and steam round the floe and so to the southward, for\nthe ice has opened up during the night, and the sea is visible upon the\nhorizon. They argue that Captain Craigie is certainly dead, and that\nwe are all risking our lives to no purpose by remaining when we have an\nopportunity of escape. Mr. Milne and I have had the greatest difficulty\nin persuading them to wait until to-morrow night, and have been\ncompelled to promise that we will not under any circumstances delay our\ndeparture longer than that. We propose therefore to take a few hours’\nsleep, and then to start upon a final search.\n\nSeptember 20th, evening.--I crossed the ice this morning with a party of\nmen exploring the southern part of the floe, while Mr. Milne went off\nin a northerly direction. We pushed on for ten or twelve miles without\nseeing a trace of any living thing except a single bird, which fluttered\na great way over our heads, and which by its flight I should judge to\nhave been a falcon. The southern extremity of the ice field tapered away\ninto a long narrow spit which projected out into the sea. When we came\nto the base of this promontory, the men halted, but I begged them to\ncontinue to the extreme end of it, that we might have the satisfaction\nof knowing that no possible chance had been neglected.\n\nWe had hardly gone a hundred yards before M’Donald of Peterhead cried\nout that he saw something in front of us, and began to run. We all got a\nglimpse of it and ran too. At first it was only a vague darkness against\nthe white ice, but as we raced along together it took the shape of a\nman, and eventually of the man of whom we were in search. He was lying\nface downwards upon a frozen bank. Many little crystals of ice and\nfeathers of snow had drifted on to him as he lay, and sparkled upon his\ndark seaman’s jacket. As we came up some wandering puff of wind caught\nthese tiny flakes in its vortex, and they whirled up into the air,\npartially descended again, and then, caught once more in the current,\nsped rapidly away in the direction of the sea. To my eyes it seemed but\na snow-drift, but many of my companions averred that it started up in\nthe shape of a woman, stooped over the corpse and kissed it, and then\nhurried away across the floe. I have learned never to ridicule any man’s\nopinion, however strange it may seem. Sure it is that Captain Nicholas\nCraigie had met with no painful end, for there was a bright smile upon\nhis blue pinched features, and his hands were still outstretched as\nthough grasping at the strange visitor which had summoned him away into\nthe dim world that lies beyond the grave.\n\nWe buried him the same afternoon with the ship’s ensign around him, and\na thirty-two pound shot at his feet. I read the burial service, while\nthe rough sailors wept like children, for there were many who owed much\nto his kind heart, and who showed now the affection which his strange\nways had repelled during his lifetime. He went off the grating with a\ndull, sullen splash, and as I looked into the green water I saw him go\ndown, down, down until he was but a little flickering patch of white\nhanging upon the outskirts of eternal darkness. Then even that faded\naway, and he was gone. There he shall lie, with his secret and his\nsorrows and his mystery all still buried in his breast, until that great\nday when the sea shall give up its dead, and Nicholas Craigie come out\nfrom among the ice with the smile upon his face, and his stiffened arms\noutstretched in greeting. I pray that his lot may be a happier one in\nthat life than it has been in this.\n\nI shall not continue my journal. Our road to home lies plain and clear\nbefore us, and the great ice field will soon be but a remembrance of\nthe past. It will be some time before I get over the shock produced by\nrecent events. When I began this record of our voyage I little thought\nof how I should be compelled to finish it. I am writing these final\nwords in the lonely cabin, still starting at times and fancying I hear\nthe quick nervous step of the dead man upon the deck above me. I entered\nhis cabin to-night, as was my duty, to make a list of his effects in\norder that they might be entered in the official log. All was as it\nhad been upon my previous visit, save that the picture which I have\ndescribed as having hung at the end of his bed had been cut out of its\nframe, as with a knife, and was gone. With this last link in a strange\nchain of evidence I close my diary of the voyage of the Pole-Star.\n\n\n[NOTE by Dr. John M’Alister Ray, senior.--I have read over the strange\nevents connected with the death of the Captain of the Pole-Star, as\nnarrated in the journal of my son. That everything occurred exactly as\nhe describes it I have the fullest confidence, and, indeed, the\nmost positive certainty, for I know him to be a strong-nerved and\nunimaginative man, with the strictest regard for veracity. Still, the\nstory is, on the face of it, so vague and so improbable, that I was long\nopposed to its publication. Within the last few days, however, I have\nhad independent testimony upon the subject which throws a new light\nupon it. I had run down to Edinburgh to attend a meeting of the British\nMedical Association, when I chanced to come across Dr. P----, an old\ncollege chum of mine, now practising at Saltash, in Devonshire. Upon my\ntelling him of this experience of my son’s, he declared to me that he\nwas familiar with the man, and proceeded, to my no small surprise, to\ngive me a description of him, which tallied remarkably well with that\ngiven in the journal, except that he depicted him as a younger man.\nAccording to his account, he had been engaged to a young lady of\nsingular beauty residing upon the Cornish coast. During his absence at\nsea his betrothed had died under circumstances of peculiar horror.]\n\n\n\n\nJ. HABAKUK JEPHSON’S STATEMENT.\n\nIn the month of December in the year 1873, the British ship Dei Gratia\nsteered into Gibraltar, having in tow the derelict brigantine Marie\nCeleste, which had been picked up in latitude 38 degrees 40’, longitude\n17 degrees 15’ W. There were several circumstances in connection with\nthe condition and appearance of this abandoned vessel which excited\nconsiderable comment at the time, and aroused a curiosity which has\nnever been satisfied. What these circumstances were was summed up in an\nable article which appeared in the Gibraltar Gazette. The curious can\nfind it in the issue for January 4, 1874, unless my memory deceives me.\nFor the benefit of those, however, who may be unable to refer to the\npaper in question, I shall subjoin a few extracts which touch upon the\nleading features of the case.\n\n“We have ourselves,” says the anonymous writer in the Gazette, “been\nover the derelict Marie Celeste, and have closelY questioned the officers\nof the Dei Gratia on every point which might throw light on the affair.\nThey are of opinion that she had been abandoned several days, or perhaps\nweeks, before being picked up. The official log, which was found in the\ncabin, states that the vessel sailed from Boston to Lisbon, starting\nupon October 16. It is, however, most imperfectly kept, and affords\nlittle information. There is no reference to rough weather, and, indeed,\nthe state of the vessel’s paint and rigging excludes the idea that she\nwas abandoned for any such reason. She is perfectly watertight. No signs\nof a struggle or of violence are to be detected, and there is absolutely\nnothing to account for the disappearance of the crew. There are several\nindications that a lady was present on board, a sewing-machine being\nfound in the cabin and some articles of female attire. These probably\nbelonged to the captain’s wife, who is mentioned in the log as having\naccompanied her husband. As an instance of the mildness of the weather,\nit may be remarked that a bobbin of silk was found standing upon\nthe sewing-machine, though the least roll of the vessel would have\nprecipitated it to the floor. The boats were intact and slung upon the\ndavits; and the cargo, consisting of tallow and American clocks, was\nuntouched. An old-fashioned sword of curious workmanship was discovered\namong some lumber in the forecastle, and this weapon is said to exhibit\na longitudinal striation on the steel, as if it had been recently wiped.\nIt has been placed in the hands of the police, and submitted to Dr.\nMonaghan, the analyst, for inspection. The result of his examination\nhas not yet been published. We may remark, in conclusion, that Captain\nDalton, of the Dei Gratia, an able and intelligent seaman, is of opinion\nthat the Marie Celeste may have been abandoned a considerable distance\nfrom the spot at which she was picked up, since a powerful current runs\nup in that latitude from the African coast. He confesses his inability,\nhowever, to advance any hypothesis which can reconcile all the facts of\nthe case. In the utter absence of a clue or grain of evidence, it is to\nbe feared that the fate of the crew of the Marie Celeste will be added\nto those numerous mysteries of the deep which will never be solved until\nthe great day when the sea shall give up its dead. If crime has been\ncommitted, as is much to be suspected, there is little hope of bringing\nthe perpetrators to justice.”\n\nI shall supplement this extract from the Gibraltar Gazette by quoting\na telegram from Boston, which went the round of the English papers, and\nrepresented the total amount of information which had been collected\nabout the Marie Celeste. “She was,” it said, “a brigantine of 170 tons\nburden, and belonged to White, Russell & White, wine importers, of this\ncity. Captain J. W. Tibbs was an old servant of the firm, and was a man\nof known ability and tried probity. He was accompanied by his wife, aged\nthirty-one, and their youngest child, five years old. The crew consisted\nof seven hands, including two coloured seamen, and a boy. There were\nthree passengers, one of whom was the well-known Brooklyn specialist on\nconsumption, Dr. Habakuk Jephson, who was a distinguished advocate\nfor Abolition in the early days of the movement, and whose pamphlet,\nentitled “Where is thy Brother?” exercised a strong influence on public\nopinion before the war. The other passengers were Mr. J. Harton, a\nwriter in the employ of the firm, and Mr. Septimius Goring, a half-caste\ngentleman, from New Orleans. All investigations have failed to throw\nany light upon the fate of these fourteen human beings. The loss of Dr.\nJephson will be felt both in political and scientific circles.”\n\nI have here epitomised, for the benefit of the public, all that has been\nhitherto known concerning the Marie Celeste and her crew, for the past\nten years have not in any way helped to elucidate the mystery. I have\nnow taken up my pen with the intention of telling all that I know of the\nill-fated voyage. I consider that it is a duty which I owe to society,\nfor symptoms which I am familiar with in others lead me to believe\nthat before many months my tongue and hand may be alike incapable of\nconveying information. Let me remark, as a preface to my narrative, that\nI am Joseph Habakuk Jephson, Doctor of Medicine of the University\nof Harvard, and ex-Consulting Physician of the Samaritan Hospital of\nBrooklyn.\n\nMany will doubtless wonder why I have not proclaimed myself before,\nand why I have suffered so many conjectures and surmises to pass\nunchallenged. Could the ends of justice have been served in any way by\nmy revealing the facts in my possession I should unhesitatingly have\ndone so. It seemed to me, however, that there was no possibility of such\na result; and when I attempted, after the occurrence, to state my case\nto an English official, I was met with such offensive incredulity that\nI determined never again to expose myself to the chance of such an\nindignity. I can excuse the discourtesy of the Liverpool magistrate,\nhowever, when I reflect upon the treatment which I received at the hands\nof my own relatives, who, though they knew my unimpeachable character,\nlistened to my statement with an indulgent smile as if humouring the\ndelusion of a monomaniac. This slur upon my veracity led to a quarrel\nbetween myself and John Vanburger, the brother of my wife, and\nconfirmed me in my resolution to let the matter sink into oblivion--a\ndetermination which I have only altered through my son’s solicitations.\nIn order to make my narrative intelligible, I must run lightly over one\nor two incidents in my former life which throw light upon subsequent\nevents.\n\nMy father, William K. Jephson, was a preacher of the sect called\nPlymouth Brethren, and was one of the most respected citizens of Lowell.\nLike most of the other Puritans of New England, he was a determined\nopponent to slavery, and it was from his lips that I received those\nlessons which tinged every action of my life. While I was studying\nmedicine at Harvard University, I had already made a mark as an advanced\nAbolitionist; and when, after taking my degree, I bought a third share\nof the practice of Dr. Willis, of Brooklyn, I managed, in spite of my\nprofessional duties, to devote a considerable time to the cause which I\nhad at heart, my pamphlet, “Where is thy Brother?” (Swarburgh, Lister &\nCo., 1859) attracting considerable attention.\n\nWhen the war broke out I left Brooklyn and accompanied the 113th New\nYork Regiment through the campaign. I was present at the second battle\nof Bull’s Run and at the battle of Gettysburg. Finally, I was severely\nwounded at Antietam, and would probably have perished on the field had\nit not been for the kindness of a gentleman named Murray, who had me\ncarried to his house and provided me with every comfort. Thanks to his\ncharity, and to the nursing which I received from his black domestics,\nI was soon able to get about the plantation with the help of a stick. It\nwas during this period of convalescence that an incident occurred which\nis closely connected with my story.\n\nAmong the most assiduous of the negresses who had watched my couch\nduring my illness there was one old crone who appeared to exert\nconsiderable authority over the others. She was exceedingly attentive\nto me, and I gathered from the few words that passed between us that\nshe had heard of me, and that she was grateful to me for championing her\noppressed race.\n\nOne day as I was sitting alone in the verandah, basking in the sun, and\ndebating whether I should rejoin Grant’s army, I was surprised to see\nthis old creature hobbling towards me. After looking cautiously around\nto see that we were alone, she fumbled in the front of her dress and\nproduced a small chamois leather bag which was hung round her neck by a\nwhite cord.\n\n“Massa,” she said, bending down and croaking the words into my ear,\n“me die soon. Me very old woman. Not stay long on Massa Murray’s\nplantation.”\n\n“You may live a long time yet, Martha,” I answered. “You know I am a\ndoctor. If you feel ill let me know about it, and I will try to cure\nyou.”\n\n“No wish to live--wish to die. I’m gwine to join the heavenly host.”\n Here she relapsed into one of those half-heathenish rhapsodies in which\nnegroes indulge. “But, massa, me have one thing must leave behind me\nwhen I go. No able to take it with me across the Jordan. That one thing\nvery precious, more precious and more holy than all thing else in the\nworld. Me, a poor old black woman, have this because my people, very\ngreat people, ‘spose they was back in the old country. But you cannot\nunderstand this same as black folk could. My fader give it me, and his\nfader give it him, but now who shall I give it to? Poor Martha hab no\nchild, no relation, nobody. All round I see black man very bad man.\nBlack woman very stupid woman. Nobody worthy of the stone. And so I say,\nHere is Massa Jephson who write books and fight for coloured folk--he\nmust be good man, and he shall have it though he is white man, and\nnebber can know what it mean or where it came from.” Here the old woman\nfumbled in the chamois leather bag and pulled out a flattish black\nstone with a hole through the middle of it. “Here, take it,” she said,\npressing it into my hand; “take it. No harm nebber come from anything\ngood. Keep it safe--nebber lose it!” and with a warning gesture the old\ncrone hobbled away in the same cautious way as she had come, looking\nfrom side to side to see if we had been observed.\n\nI was more amused than impressed by the old woman’s earnestness, and was\nonly prevented from laughing during her oration by the fear of hurting\nher feelings. When she was gone I took a good look at the stone which\nshe had given me. It was intensely black, of extreme hardness, and oval\nin shape--just such a flat stone as one would pick up on the seashore if\none wished to throw a long way. It was about three inches long, and an\ninch and a half broad at the middle, but rounded off at the extremities.\nThe most curious part about it were several well-marked ridges which ran\nin semicircles over its surface, and gave it exactly the appearance of a\nhuman ear. Altogether I was rather interested in my new possession,\nand determined to submit it, as a geological specimen, to my friend\nProfessor Shroeder of the New York Institute, upon the earliest\nopportunity. In the meantime I thrust it into my pocket, and rising from\nmy chair started off for a short stroll in the shrubbery, dismissing the\nincident from my mind.\n\nAs my wound had nearly healed by this time, I took my leave of Mr.\nMurray shortly afterwards. The Union armies were everywhere victorious\nand converging on Richmond, so that my assistance seemed unnecessary,\nand I returned to Brooklyn. There I resumed my practice, and married the\nsecond daughter of Josiah Vanburger, the well-known wood engraver. In\nthe course of a few years I built up a good connection and acquired\nconsiderable reputation in the treatment of pulmonary complaints. I\nstill kept the old black stone in my pocket, and frequently told the\nstory of the dramatic way in which I had become possessed of it. I also\nkept my resolution of showing it to Professor Shroeder, who was much\ninterested both by the anecdote and the specimen. He pronounced it to\nbe a piece of meteoric stone, and drew my attention to the fact that its\nresemblance to an ear was not accidental, but that it was most carefully\nworked into that shape. A dozen little anatomical points showed that the\nworker had been as accurate as he was skilful. “I should not wonder,”\n said the Professor, “if it were broken off from some larger statue,\nthough how such hard material could be so perfectly worked is more than\nI can understand. If there is a statue to correspond I should like to\nsee it!” So I thought at the time, but I have changed my opinion since.\n\nThe next seven or eight years of my life were quiet and uneventful.\n\nSummer followed spring, and spring followed winter, without any\nvariation in my duties. As the practice increased I admitted J. S.\nJackson as partner, he to have one-fourth of the profits. The continued\nstrain had told upon my constitution, however, and I became at last so\nunwell that my wife insisted upon my consulting Dr. Kavanagh Smith, who\nwas my colleague at the Samaritan Hospital.\n\nThat gentleman examined me, and pronounced the apex of my left lung to\nbe in a state of consolidation, recommending me at the same time to go\nthrough a course of medical treatment and to take a long sea-voyage.\n\nMy own disposition, which is naturally restless, predisposed me strongly\nin favour of the latter piece of advice, and the matter was clinched\nby my meeting young Russell, of the firm of White, Russell & White, who\noffered me a passage in one of his father’s ships, the Marie Celeste,\nwhich was just starting from Boston. “She is a snug little ship,” he\nsaid, “and Tibbs, the captain, is an excellent fellow. There is nothing\nlike a sailing ship for an invalid.” I was very much of the same opinion\nmyself, so I closed with the offer on the spot.\n\nMy original plan was that my wife should accompany me on my travels.\nShe has always been a very poor sailor, however, and there were strong\nfamily reasons against her exposing herself to any risk at the time, so\nwe determined that she should remain at home. I am not a religious or an\neffusive man; but oh, thank God for that! As to leaving my practice, I\nwas easily reconciled to it, as Jackson, my partner, was a reliable and\nhard-working man.\n\nI arrived in Boston on October 12, 1873, and proceeded immediately to\nthe office of the firm in order to thank them for their courtesy. As\nI was sitting in the counting-house waiting until they should be\nat liberty to see me, the words Marie Celeste suddenly attracted my\nattention. I looked round and saw a very tall, gaunt man, who was\nleaning across the polished mahogany counter asking some questions of\nthe clerk at the other side. His face was turned half towards me, and\nI could see that he had a strong dash of negro blood in him, being\nprobably a quadroon or even nearer akin to the black. His curved\naquiline nose and straight lank hair showed the white strain; but the\ndark restless eye, sensuous mouth, and gleaming teeth all told of his\nAfrican origin. His complexion was of a sickly, unhealthy yellow, and as\nhis face was deeply pitted with small-pox, the general impression was so\nunfavourable as to be almost revolting. When he spoke, however, it\nwas in a soft, melodious voice, and in well-chosen words, and he was\nevidently a man of some education.\n\n“I wished to ask a few questions about the Marie Celeste,” he repeated,\nleaning across to the clerk. “She sails the day after to-morrow, does\nshe not?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” said the young clerk, awed into unusual politeness by the\nglimmer of a large diamond in the stranger’s shirt front.\n\n“Where is she bound for?”\n\n“Lisbon.”\n\n“How many of a crew?”\n\n“Seven, sir.”\n\n“Passengers?”\n\n“Yes, two. One of our young gentlemen, and a doctor from New York.”\n\n“No gentleman from the South?” asked the stranger eagerly.\n\n“No, none, sir.”\n\n“Is there room for another passenger?”\n\n“Accommodation for three more,” answered the clerk.\n\n“I’ll go,” said the quadroon decisively; “I’ll go, I’ll engage my\npassage at once. Put it down, will you--Mr. Septimius Goring, of New\nOrleans.”\n\nThe clerk filled up a form and handed it over to the stranger, pointing\nto a blank space at the bottom. As Mr. Goring stooped over to sign it\nI was horrified to observe that the fingers of his right hand had been\nlopped off, and that he was holding the pen between his thumb and the\npalm. I have seen thousands slain in battle, and assisted at every\nconceivable surgical operation, but I cannot recall any sight which gave\nme such a thrill of disgust as that great brown sponge-like hand with\nthe single member protruding from it. He used it skilfully enough,\nhowever, for, dashing off his signature, he nodded to the clerk and\nstrolled out of the office just as Mr. White sent out word that he was\nready to receive me.\n\nI went down to the Marie Celeste that evening, and looked over my\nberth, which was extremely comfortable considering the small size of the\nvessel. Mr. Goring, whom I had seen in the morning, was to have the one\nnext mine. Opposite was the captain’s cabin and a small berth for Mr.\nJohn Harton, a gentleman who was going out in the interests of the firm.\nThese little rooms were arranged on each side of the passage which led\nfrom the main-deck to the saloon. The latter was a comfortable room,\nthe panelling tastefully done in oak and mahogany, with a rich\nBrussels carpet and luxurious settees. I was very much pleased with the\naccommodation, and also with Tibbs the captain, a bluff, sailor-like\nfellow, with a loud voice and hearty manner, who welcomed me to the ship\nwith effusion, and insisted upon our splitting a bottle of wine in his\ncabin. He told me that he intended to take his wife and youngest child\nwith him on the voyage, and that he hoped with good luck to make Lisbon\nin three weeks. We had a pleasant chat and parted the best of friends,\nhe warning me to make the last of my preparations next morning, as he\nintended to make a start by the midday tide, having now shipped all\nhis cargo. I went back to my hotel, where I found a letter from my wife\nawaiting me, and, after a refreshing night’s sleep, returned to the\nboat in the morning. From this point I am able to quote from the journal\nwhich I kept in order to vary the monotony of the long sea-voyage. If\nit is somewhat bald in places I can at least rely upon its accuracy in\ndetails, as it was written conscientiously from day to day.\n\nOctober 16.--Cast off our warps at half-past two and were towed out into\nthe bay, where the tug left us, and with all sail set we bowled along at\nabout nine knots an hour. I stood upon the poop watching the low land of\nAmerica sinking gradually upon the horizon until the evening haze hid it\nfrom my sight. A single red light, however, continued to blaze balefully\nbehind us, throwing a long track like a trail of blood upon the water,\nand it is still visible as I write, though reduced to a mere speck. The\nCaptain is in a bad humour, for two of his hands disappointed him at\nthe last moment, and he was compelled to ship a couple of negroes\nwho happened to be on the quay. The missing men were steady, reliable\nfellows, who had been with him several voyages, and their non-appearance\npuzzled as well as irritated him. Where a crew of seven men have to work\na fair-sized ship the loss of two experienced seamen is a serious one,\nfor though the negroes may take a spell at the wheel or swab the decks,\nthey are of little or no use in rough weather. Our cook is also a black\nman, and Mr. Septimius Goring has a little darkie servant, so that we\nare rather a piebald community. The accountant, John Harton, promises to\nbe an acquisition, for he is a cheery, amusing young fellow. Strange how\nlittle wealth has to do with happiness! He has all the world before him\nand is seeking his fortune in a far land, yet he is as transparently\nhappy as a man can be. Goring is rich, if I am not mistaken, and so am\nI; but I know that I have a lung, and Goring has some deeper trouble\nstill, to judge by his features. How poorly do we both contrast with the\ncareless, penniless clerk!\n\nOctober 17.--Mrs. Tibbs appeared upon deck for the first time this\nmorning--a cheerful, energetic woman, with a dear little child just able\nto walk and prattle. Young Harton pounced on it at once, and carried\nit away to his cabin, where no doubt he will lay the seeds of future\ndyspepsia in the child’s stomach. Thus medicine doth make cynics of us\nall! The weather is still all that could be desired, with a fine fresh\nbreeze from the west-sou’-west. The vessel goes so steadily that you\nwould hardly know that she was moving were it not for the creaking of\nthe cordage, the bellying of the sails, and the long white furrow in our\nwake. Walked the quarter-deck all morning with the Captain, and I think\nthe keen fresh air has already done my breathing good, for the exercise\ndid not fatigue me in any way. Tibbs is a remarkably intelligent man,\nand we had an interesting argument about Maury’s observations on ocean\ncurrents, which we terminated by going down into his cabin to consult\nthe original work. There we found Goring, rather to the Captain’s\nsurprise, as it is not usual for passengers to enter that sanctum unless\nspecially invited. He apologised for his intrusion, however, pleading\nhis ignorance of the usages of ship life; and the good-natured sailor\nsimply laughed at the incident, begging him to remain and favour us with\nhis company. Goring pointed to the chronometers, the case of which\nhe had opened, and remarked that he had been admiring them. He has\nevidently some practical knowledge of mathematical instruments, as he\ntold at a glance which was the most trustworthy of the three, and also\nnamed their price within a few dollars. He had a discussion with the\nCaptain too upon the variation of the compass, and when we came back to\nthe ocean currents he showed a thorough grasp of the subject. Altogether\nhe rather improves upon acquaintance, and is a man of decided culture\nand refinement. His voice harmonises with his conversation, and both are\nthe very antithesis of his face and figure.\n\nThe noonday observation shows that we have run two hundred and twenty\nmiles. Towards evening the breeze freshened up, and the first mate\nordered reefs to be taken in the topsails and top-gallant sails in\nexpectation of a windy night. I observe that the barometer has fallen to\ntwenty-nine. I trust our voyage will not be a rough one, as I am a poor\nsailor, and my health would probably derive more harm than good from\na stormy trip, though I have the greatest confidence in the Captain’s\nseamanship and in the soundness of the vessel. Played cribbage with Mrs.\nTibbs after supper, and Harton gave us a couple of tunes on the violin.\n\nOctober 18.--The gloomy prognostications of last night were not\nfulfilled, as the wind died away again, and we are lying now in a long\ngreasy swell, ruffled here and there by a fleeting catspaw which is\ninsufficient to fill the sails. The air is colder than it was yesterday,\nand I have put on one of the thick woollen jerseys which my wife knitted\nfor me. Harton came into my cabin in the morning, and we had a cigar\ntogether. He says that he remembers having seen Goring in Cleveland,\nOhio, in ‘69. He was, it appears, a mystery then as now, wandering\nabout without any visible employment, and extremely reticent on his own\naffairs. The man interests me as a psychological study. At breakfast\nthis morning I suddenly had that vague feeling of uneasiness which comes\nover some people when closely stared at, and, looking quickly up, I\nmet his eyes bent upon me with an intensity which amounted to ferocity,\nthough their expression instantly softened as he made some conventional\nremark upon the weather. Curiously enough, Harton says that he had\na very similar experience yesterday upon deck. I observe that Goring\nfrequently talks to the coloured seamen as he strolls about--a trait\nwhich I rather admire, as it is common to find half-breeds ignore their\ndark strain and treat their black kinsfolk with greater intolerance than\na white man would do. His little page is devoted to him, apparently,\nwhich speaks well for his treatment of him. Altogether, the man is a\ncurious mixture of incongruous qualities, and unless I am deceived in\nhim will give me food for observation during the voyage.\n\nThe Captain is grumbling about his chronometers, which do not register\nexactly the same time. He says it is the first time that they have ever\ndisagreed. We were unable to get a noonday observation on account of the\nhaze. By dead reckoning, we have done about a hundred and seventy miles\nin the twenty-four hours. The dark seamen have proved, as the skipper\nprophesied, to be very inferior hands, but as they can both manage the\nwheel well they are kept steering, and so leave the more experienced men\nto work the ship. These details are trivial enough, but a small thing\nserves as food for gossip aboard ship. The appearance of a whale in the\nevening caused quite a flutter among us. From its sharp back and forked\ntail, I should pronounce it to have been a rorqual, or “finner,” as they\nare called by the fishermen.\n\nOctober 19.--Wind was cold, so I prudently remained in my cabin all day,\nonly creeping out for dinner. Lying in my bunk I can, without moving,\nreach my books, pipes, or anything else I may want, which is one\nadvantage of a small apartment. My old wound began to ache a little\nto-day, probably from the cold. Read “Montaigne’s Essays” and nursed\nmyself. Harton came in in the afternoon with Doddy, the Captain’s child,\nand the skipper himself followed, so that I held quite a reception.\n\nOctober 20 and 21.--Still cold, with a continual drizzle of rain, and\nI have not been able to leave the cabin. This confinement makes me feel\nweak and depressed. Goring came in to see me, but his company did not\ntend to cheer me up much, as he hardly uttered a word, but contented\nhimself with staring at me in a peculiar and rather irritating manner.\nHe then got up and stole out of the cabin without saying anything. I am\nbeginning to suspect that the man is a lunatic. I think I mentioned that\nhis cabin is next to mine. The two are simply divided by a thin wooden\npartition which is cracked in many places, some of the cracks being\nso large that I can hardly avoid, as I lie in my bunk, observing his\nmotions in the adjoining room. Without any wish to play the spy, I see\nhim continually stooping over what appears to be a chart and working\nwith a pencil and compasses. I have remarked the interest he displays\nin matters connected with navigation, but I am surprised that he should\ntake the trouble to work out the course of the ship. However, it is a\nharmless amusement enough, and no doubt he verifies his results by those\nof the Captain.\n\nI wish the man did not run in my thoughts so much. I had a nightmare on\nthe night of the 20th, in which I thought my bunk was a coffin, that I\nwas laid out in it, and that Goring was endeavouring to nail up the\nlid, which I was frantically pushing away. Even when I woke up, I could\nhardly persuade myself that I was not in a coffin. As a medical man, I\nknow that a nightmare is simply a vascular derangement of the cerebral\nhemispheres, and yet in my weak state I cannot shake off the morbid\nimpression which it produces.\n\nOctober 22.--A fine day, with hardly a cloud in the sky, and a fresh\nbreeze from the sou’-west which wafts us gaily on our way. There has\nevidently been some heavy weather near us, as there is a tremendous\nswell on, and the ship lurches until the end of the fore-yard nearly\ntouches the water. Had a refreshing walk up and down the quarter-deck,\nthough I have hardly found my sea-legs yet. Several small\nbirds--chaffinches, I think--perched in the rigging.\n\n4.40 P.M.--While I was on deck this morning I heard a sudden explosion\nfrom the direction of my cabin, and, hurrying down, found that I had\nvery nearly met with a serious accident. Goring was cleaning a revolver,\nit seems, in his cabin, when one of the barrels which he thought was\nunloaded went off. The ball passed through the side partition and\nimbedded itself in the bulwarks in the exact place where my head usually\nrests. I have been under fire too often to magnify trifles, but there is\nno doubt that if I had been in the bunk it must have killed me. Goring,\npoor fellow, did not know that I had gone on deck that day, and must\ntherefore have felt terribly frightened. I never saw such emotion in a\nman’s face as when, on rushing out of his cabin with the smoking pistol\nin his hand, he met me face to face as I came down from deck. Of\ncourse, he was profuse in his apologies, though I simply laughed at the\nincident.\n\n11 P.M.--A misfortune has occurred so unexpected and so horrible that\nmy little escape of the morning dwindles into insignificance. Mrs. Tibbs\nand her child have disappeared--utterly and entirely disappeared. I can\nhardly compose myself to write the sad details.\n\nAbout half-past eight Tibbs rushed into my cabin with a very white face\nand asked me if I had seen his wife. I answered that I had not. He then\nran wildly into the saloon and began groping about for any trace of her,\nwhile I followed him, endeavouring vainly to persuade him that his fears\nwere ridiculous. We hunted over the ship for an hour and a half without\ncoming on any sign of the missing woman or child. Poor Tibbs lost\nhis voice completely from calling her name. Even the sailors, who are\ngenerally stolid enough, were deeply affected by the sight of him as\nhe roamed bareheaded and dishevelled about the deck, searching with\nfeverish anxiety the most impossible places, and returning to them again\nand again with a piteous pertinacity. The last time she was seen was\nabout seven o’clock, when she took Doddy on to the poop to give him a\nbreath of fresh air before putting him to bed. There was no one there\nat the time except the black seaman at the wheel, who denies having seen\nher at all. The whole affair is wrapped in mystery. My own theory\nis that while Mrs. Tibbs was holding the child and standing near the\nbulwarks it gave a spring and fell overboard, and that in her convulsive\nattempt to catch or save it, she followed it. I cannot account for the\ndouble disappearance in any other way. It is quite feasible that such a\ntragedy should be enacted without the knowledge of the man at the wheel,\nsince it was dark at the time, and the peaked skylights of the saloon\nscreen the greater part of the quarter-deck. Whatever the truth may be\nit is a terrible catastrophe, and has cast the darkest gloom upon our\nvoyage. The mate has put the ship about, but of course there is not the\nslightest hope of picking them up. The Captain is lying in a state of\nstupor in his cabin. I gave him a powerful dose of opium in his coffee\nthat for a few hours at least his anguish may be deadened.\n\nOctober 23.--Woke with a vague feeling of heaviness and misfortune, but\nit was not until a few moments’ reflection that I was able to recall\nour loss of the night before. When I came on deck I saw the poor skipper\nstanding gazing back at the waste of waters behind us which contains\neverything dear to him upon earth. I attempted to speak to him, but he\nturned brusquely away, and began pacing the deck with his head sunk upon\nhis breast. Even now, when the truth is so clear, he cannot pass a boat\nor an unbent sail without peering under it. He looks ten years older\nthan he did yesterday morning. Harton is terribly cut up, for he was\nfond of little Doddy, and Goring seems sorry too. At least he has shut\nhimself up in his cabin all day, and when I got a casual glance at him\nhis head was resting on his two hands as if in a melancholy reverie. I\nfear we are about as dismal a crew as ever sailed. How shocked my wife\nwill be to hear of our disaster! The swell has gone down now, and we\nare doing about eight knots with all sail set and a nice little breeze.\nHyson is practically in command of the ship, as Tibbs, though he does\nhis best to bear up and keep a brave front, is incapable of applying\nhimself to serious work.\n\nOctober 24.--Is the ship accursed? Was there ever a voyage which began\nso fairly and which changed so disastrously? Tibbs shot himself through\nthe head during the night. I was awakened about three o’clock in the\nmorning by an explosion, and immediately sprang out of bed and rushed\ninto the Captain’s cabin to find out the cause, though with a terrible\npresentiment in my heart. Quickly as I went, Goring went more quickly\nstill, for he was already in the cabin stooping over the dead body of\nthe Captain. It was a hideous sight, for the whole front of his face\nwas blown in, and the little room was swimming in blood. The pistol was\nlying beside him on the floor, just as it had dropped from his hand. He\nhad evidently put it to his mouth before pulling the trigger. Goring\nand I picked him reverently up and laid him on his bed. The crew had all\nclustered into his cabin, and the six white men were deeply grieved, for\nthey were old hands who had sailed with him many years. There were dark\nlooks and murmurs among them too, and one of them openly declared that\nthe ship was haunted. Harton helped to lay the poor skipper out, and\nwe did him up in canvas between us. At twelve o’clock the foreyard was\nhauled aback, and we committed his body to the deep, Goring reading the\nChurch of England burial service. The breeze has freshened up, and we\nhave done ten knots all day and sometimes twelve. The sooner we reach\nLisbon and get away from this accursed ship the better pleased shall I\nbe. I feel as though we were in a floating coffin.\n\nLittle wonder that the poor sailors are superstitious when I, an\neducated man, feel it so strongly.\n\nOctober 25.--Made a good run all day. Feel listless and depressed.\n\nOctober 26.--Goring, Harton, and I had a chat together on deck in the\nmorning. Harton tried to draw Goring out as to his profession, and his\nobject in going to Europe, but the quadroon parried all his questions\nand gave us no information. Indeed, he seemed to be slightly offended\nby Harton’s pertinacity, and went down into his cabin. I wonder why\nwe should both take such an interest in this man! I suppose it is his\nstriking appearance, coupled with his apparent wealth, which piques our\ncuriosity. Harton has a theory that he is really a detective, that he\nis after some criminal who has got away to Portugal, and that he chooses\nthis peculiar way of travelling that he may arrive unnoticed and\npounce upon his quarry unawares. I think the supposition is rather a\nfar-fetched one, but Harton bases it upon a book which Goring left\non deck, and which he picked up and glanced over. It was a sort of\nscrap-book it seems, and contained a large number of newspaper cuttings.\nAll these cuttings related to murders which had been committed at\nvarious times in the States during the last twenty years or so. The\ncurious thing which Harton observed about them, however, was that they\nwere invariably murders the authors of which had never been brought\nto justice. They varied in every detail, he says, as to the manner of\nexecution and the social status of the victim, but they uniformly wound\nup with the same formula that the murderer was still at large, though,\nof course, the police had every reason to expect his speedy capture.\nCertainly the incident seems to support Harton’s theory, though it\nmay be a mere whim of Gorings, or, as I suggested to Harton, he may be\ncollecting materials for a book which shall outvie De Quincey. In any\ncase it is no business of ours.\n\nOctober 27, 28.--Wind still fair, and we are making good progress.\nStrange how easily a human unit may drop out of its place and be\nforgotten! Tibbs is hardly ever mentioned now; Hyson has taken\npossession of his cabin, and all goes on as before. Were it not for\nMrs. Tibbs’s sewing-machine upon a side-table we might forget that the\nunfortunate family had ever existed. Another accident occurred on board\nto-day, though fortunately not a very serious one. One of our white\nhands had gone down the afterhold to fetch up a spare coil of rope, when\none of the hatches which he had removed came crashing down on the top of\nhim. He saved his life by springing out of the way, but one of his feet\nwas terribly crushed, and he will be of little use for the remainder of\nthe voyage. He attributes the accident to the carelessness of his negro\ncompanion, who had helped him to shift the hatches. The latter, however,\nputs it down to the roll of the ship. Whatever be the cause, it reduces\nour shorthanded crew still further. This run of ill-luck seems to be\ndepressing Harton, for he has lost his usual good spirits and joviality.\nGoring is the only one who preserves his cheerfulness. I see him still\nworking at his chart in his own cabin. His nautical knowledge would be\nuseful should anything happen to Hyson--which God forbid!\n\nOctober 29, 30.--Still bowling along with a fresh breeze. All quiet and\nnothing of note to chronicle.\n\nOctober 31.--My weak lungs, combined with the exciting episodes of the\nvoyage, have shaken my nervous system so much that the most trivial\nincident affects me. I can hardly believe that I am the same man who\ntied the external iliac artery, an operation requiring the nicest\nprecision, under a heavy rifle fire at Antietam. I am as nervous as a\nchild. I was lying half dozing last night about four bells in the middle\nwatch trying in vain to drop into a refreshing sleep. There was no light\ninside my cabin, but a single ray of moonlight streamed in through the\nport-hole, throwing a silvery flickering circle upon the door. As I lay\nI kept my drowsy eyes upon this circle, and was conscious that it was\ngradually becoming less well-defined as my senses left me, when I was\nsuddenly recalled to full wakefulness by the appearance of a small\ndark object in the very centre of the luminous disc. I lay quietly and\nbreathlessly watching it. Gradually it grew larger and plainer, and then\nI perceived that it was a human hand which had been cautiously inserted\nthrough the chink of the half-closed door--a hand which, as I observed\nwith a thrill of horror, was not provided with fingers. The door swung\ncautiously backwards, and Goring’s head followed his hand. It appeared\nin the centre of the moonlight, and was framed as it were in a ghastly\nuncertain halo, against which his features showed out plainly. It seemed\nto me that I had never seen such an utterly fiendish and merciless\nexpression upon a human face. His eyes were dilated and glaring, his\nlips drawn back so as to show his white fangs, and his straight black\nhair appeared to bristle over his low forehead like the hood of a cobra.\nThe sudden and noiseless apparition had such an effect upon me that I\nsprang up in bed trembling in every limb, and held out my hand towards\nmy revolver. I was heartily ashamed of my hastiness when he explained\nthe object of his intrusion, as he immediately did in the most courteous\nlanguage. He had been suffering from toothache, poor fellow! and had\ncome in to beg some laudanum, knowing that I possessed a medicine chest.\nAs to a sinister expression he is never a beauty, and what with my state\nof nervous tension and the effect of the shifting moonlight it was easy\nto conjure up something horrible. I gave him twenty drops, and he went\noff again with many expressions of gratitude. I can hardly say how much\nthis trivial incident affected me. I have felt unstrung all day.\n\nA week’s record of our voyage is here omitted, as nothing eventful\noccurred during the time, and my log consists merely of a few pages of\nunimportant gossip.\n\nNovember 7.--Harton and I sat on the poop all the morning, for the\nweather is becoming very warm as we come into southern latitudes. We\nreckon that we have done two-thirds of our voyage. How glad we shall\nbe to see the green banks of the Tagus, and leave this unlucky ship for\never! I was endeavouring to amuse Harton to-day and to while away the\ntime by telling him some of the experiences of my past life. Among\nothers I related to him how I came into the possession of my black\nstone, and as a finale I rummaged in the side pocket of my old shooting\ncoat and produced the identical object in question. He and I were\nbending over it together, I pointing out to him the curious ridges upon\nits surface, when we were conscious of a shadow falling between us and\nthe sun, and looking round saw Goring standing behind us glaring over\nour shoulders at the stone. For some reason or other he appeared to be\npowerfully excited, though he was evidently trying to control himself\nand to conceal his emotion. He pointed once or twice at my relic with\nhis stubby thumb before he could recover himself sufficiently to ask\nwhat it was and how I obtained it--a question put in such a brusque\nmanner that I should have been offended had I not known the man to be an\neccentric. I told him the story very much as I had told it to Harton. He\nlistened with the deepest interest, and then asked me if I had any idea\nwhat the stone was. I said I had not, beyond that it was meteoric. He\nasked me if I had ever tried its effect upon a negro. I said I had not.\n“Come,” said he, “we’ll see what our black friend at the wheel thinks\nof it.” He took the stone in his hand and went across to the sailor,\nand the two examined it carefully. I could see the man gesticulating and\nnodding his head excitedly as if making some assertion, while his face\nbetrayed the utmost astonishment, mixed I think with some reverence.\nGoring came across the deck to us presently, still holding the stone in\nhis hand. “He says it is a worthless, useless thing,” he said, “and fit\nonly to be chucked overboard,” with which he raised his hand and would\nmost certainly have made an end of my relic, had the black sailor behind\nhim not rushed forward and seized him by the wrist. Finding himself\nsecured Goring dropped the stone and turned away with a very bad grace\nto avoid my angry remonstrances at his breach of faith. The black\npicked up the stone and handed it to me with a low bow and every sign of\nprofound respect. The whole affair is inexplicable. I am rapidly coming\nto the conclusion that Goring is a maniac or something very near\none. When I compare the effect produced by the stone upon the sailor,\nhowever, with the respect shown to Martha on the plantation, and the\nsurprise of Goring on its first production, I cannot but come to the\nconclusion that I have really got hold of some powerful talisman which\nappeals to the whole dark race. I must not trust it in Goring’s hands\nagain.\n\nNovember 8, 9.--What splendid weather we are having! Beyond one little\nblow, we have had nothing but fresh breezes the whole voyage. These two\ndays we have made better runs than any hitherto.\n\nIt is a pretty thing to watch the spray fly up from our prow as it cuts\nthrough the waves. The sun shines through it and breaks it up into a\nnumber of miniature rainbows--“sun-dogs,” the sailors call them. I stood\non the fo’csle-head for several hours to-day watching the effect, and\nsurrounded by a halo of prismatic colours.\n\nThe steersman has evidently told the other blacks about my wonderful\nstone, for I am treated by them all with the greatest respect. Talking\nabout optical phenomena, we had a curious one yesterday evening which\nwas pointed out to me by Hyson. This was the appearance of a triangular\nwell-defined object high up in the heavens to the north of us. He\nexplained that it was exactly like the Peak of Teneriffe as seen from\na great distance--the peak was, however, at that moment at least five\nhundred miles to the south. It may have been a cloud, or it may have\nbeen one of those strange reflections of which one reads. The weather\nis very warm. The mate says that he never knew it so warm in these\nlatitudes. Played chess with Harton in the evening.\n\nNovember 10.--It is getting warmer and warmer. Some land birds came and\nperched in the rigging today, though we are still a considerable way\nfrom our destination. The heat is so great that we are too lazy to do\nanything but lounge about the decks and smoke. Goring came over to me\nto-day and asked me some more questions about my stone; but I answered\nhim rather shortly, for I have not quite forgiven him yet for the cool\nway in which he attempted to deprive me of it.\n\nNovember 11, 12.--Still making good progress. I had no idea Portugal was\never as hot as this, but no doubt it is cooler on land. Hyson himself\nseemed surprised at it, and so do the men.\n\nNovember 13.--A most extraordinary event has happened, so extraordinary\nas to be almost inexplicable. Either Hyson has blundered wonderfully,\nor some magnetic influence has disturbed our instruments. Just about\ndaybreak the watch on the fo’csle-head shouted out that he heard the\nsound of surf ahead, and Hyson thought he saw the loom of land. The ship\nwas put about, and, though no lights were seen, none of us doubted that\nwe had struck the Portuguese coast a little sooner than we had expected.\nWhat was our surprise to see the scene which was revealed to us at break\nof day! As far as we could look on either side was one long line of\nsurf, great, green billows rolling in and breaking into a cloud of foam.\nBut behind the surf what was there! Not the green banks nor the\nhigh cliffs of the shores of Portugal, but a great sandy waste which\nstretched away and away until it blended with the skyline. To right and\nleft, look where you would, there was nothing but yellow sand, heaped\nin some places into fantastic mounds, some of them several hundred feet\nhigh, while in other parts were long stretches as level apparently as a\nbilliard board. Harton and I, who had come on deck together, looked\nat each other in astonishment, and Harton burst out laughing. Hyson\nis exceedingly mortified at the occurrence, and protests that the\ninstruments have been tampered with. There is no doubt that this is the\nmainland of Africa, and that it was really the Peak of Teneriffe which\nwe saw some days ago upon the northern horizon. At the time when we saw\nthe land birds we must have been passing some of the Canary Islands. If\nwe continued on the same course, we are now to the north of Cape Blanco,\nnear the unexplored country which skirts the great Sahara. All we can\ndo is to rectify our instruments as far as possible and start afresh for\nour destination.\n\n8.30 P.M.--Have been lying in a calm all day. The coast is now about a\nmile and a half from us. Hyson has examined the instruments, but cannot\nfind any reason for their extraordinary deviation.\n\nThis is the end of my private journal, and I must make the remainder of\nmy statement from memory. There is little chance of my being mistaken\nabout facts which have seared themselves into my recollection. That very\nnight the storm which had been brewing so long burst over us, and I came\nto learn whither all those little incidents were tending which I had\nrecorded so aimlessly. Blind fool that I was not to have seen it sooner!\nI shall tell what occurred as precisely as I can.\n\nI had gone into my cabin about half-past eleven, and was preparing to go\nto bed, when a tap came at my door. On opening it I saw Goring’s little\nblack page, who told me that his master would like to have a word with\nme on deck. I was rather surprised that he should want me at such a late\nhour, but I went up without hesitation. I had hardly put my foot on the\nquarter-deck before I was seized from behind, dragged down upon my back,\nand a handkerchief slipped round my mouth. I struggled as hard as I\ncould, but a coil of rope was rapidly and firmly wound round me, and I\nfound myself lashed to the davit of one of the boats, utterly powerless\nto do or say anything, while the point of a knife pressed to my throat\nwarned me to cease my struggles. The night was so dark that I had\nbeen unable hitherto to recognise my assailants, but as my eyes became\naccustomed to the gloom, and the moon broke out through the clouds that\nobscured it, I made out that I was surrounded by the two negro sailors,\nthe black cook, and my fellow-passenger Goring. Another man was\ncrouching on the deck at my feet, but he was in the shadow and I could\nnot recognise him.\n\nAll this occurred so rapidly that a minute could hardly have elapsed\nfrom the time I mounted the companion until I found myself gagged and\npowerless. It was so sudden that I could scarce bring myself to realise\nit, or to comprehend what it all meant. I heard the gang round me\nspeaking in short, fierce whispers to each other, and some instinct told\nme that my life was the question at issue. Goring spoke authoritatively\nand angrily--the others doggedly and all together, as if disputing his\ncommands. Then they moved away in a body to the opposite side of\nthe deck, where I could still hear them whispering, though they were\nconcealed from my view by the saloon skylights.\n\nAll this time the voices of the watch on deck chatting and laughing at\nthe other end of the ship were distinctly audible, and I could see them\ngathered in a group, little dreaming of the dark doings which were going\non within thirty yards of them. Oh! that I could have given them one\nword of warning, even though I had lost my life in doing it! but it was\nimpossible. The moon was shining fitfully through the scattered clouds,\nand I could see the silvery gleam of the surge, and beyond it the vast\nweird desert with its fantastic sand-hills. Glancing down, I saw that\nthe man who had been crouching on the deck was still lying there, and\nas I gazed at him, a flickering ray of moonlight fell full upon his\nupturned face. Great Heaven! even now, when more than twelve years\nhave elapsed, my hand trembles as I write that, in spite of distorted\nfeatures and projecting eyes, I recognised the face of Harton, the\ncheery young clerk who had been my companion during the voyage. It\nneeded no medical eye to see that he was quite dead, while the twisted\nhandkerchief round the neck, and the gag in his mouth, showed the\nsilent way in which the hell-hounds had done their work. The clue which\nexplained every event of our voyage came upon me like a flash of light\nas I gazed on poor Harton’s corpse. Much was dark and unexplained, but I\nfelt a great dim perception of the truth.\n\nI heard the striking of a match at the other side of the skylights, and\nthen I saw the tall, gaunt figure of Goring standing up on the bulwarks\nand holding in his hands what appeared to be a dark lantern. He lowered\nthis for a moment over the side of the ship, and, to my inexpressible\nastonishment, I saw it answered instantaneously by a flash among the\nsand-hills on shore, which came and went so rapidly, that unless I\nhad been following the direction of Goring’s gaze, I should never have\ndetected it. Again he lowered the lantern, and again it was answered\nfrom the shore. He then stepped down from the bulwarks, and in doing so\nslipped, making such a noise, that for a moment my heart bounded with\nthe thought that the attention of the watch would be directed to\nhis proceedings. It was a vain hope. The night was calm and the ship\nmotionless, so that no idea of duty kept them vigilant. Hyson, who after\nthe death of Tibbs was in command of both watches, had gone below to\nsnatch a few hours’ sleep, and the boatswain who was left in charge was\nstanding with the other two men at the foot of the foremast. Powerless,\nspeechless, with the cords cutting into my flesh and the murdered man at\nmy feet, I awaited the next act in the tragedy.\n\nThe four ruffians were standing up now at the other side of the deck.\nThe cook was armed with some sort of a cleaver, the others had knives,\nand Goring had a revolver. They were all leaning against the rail and\nlooking out over the water as if watching for something. I saw one of\nthem grasp another’s arm and point as if at some object, and following\nthe direction I made out the loom of a large moving mass making towards\nthe ship. As it emerged from the gloom I saw that it was a great canoe\ncrammed with men and propelled by at least a score of paddles. As it\nshot under our stern the watch caught sight of it also, and raising\na cry hurried aft. They were too late, however. A swarm of gigantic\nnegroes clambered over the quarter, and led by Goring swept down the\ndeck in an irresistible torrent. All opposition was overpowered in a\nmoment, the unarmed watch were knocked over and bound, and the sleepers\ndragged out of their bunks and secured in the same manner.\n\nHyson made an attempt to defend the narrow passage leading to his cabin,\nand I heard a scuffle, and his voice shouting for assistance. There\nwas none to assist, however, and he was brought on to the poop with the\nblood streaming from a deep cut in his forehead. He was gagged like the\nothers, and a council was held upon our fate by the negroes. I saw our\nblack seamen pointing towards me and making some statement, which was\nreceived with murmurs of astonishment and incredulity by the savages.\nOne of them then came over to me, and plunging his hand into my pocket\ntook out my black stone and held it up. He then handed it to a man who\nappeared to be a chief, who examined it as minutely as the light would\npermit, and muttering a few words passed it on to the warrior beside\nhim, who also scrutinised it and passed it on until it had gone from\nhand to hand round the whole circle. The chief then said a few words\nto Goring in the native tongue, on which the quadroon addressed me in\nEnglish. At this moment I seem to see the scene. The tall masts of the\nship with the moonlight streaming down, silvering the yards and bringing\nthe network of cordage into hard relief; the group of dusky warriors\nleaning on their spears; the dead man at my feet; the line of\nwhite-faced prisoners, and in front of me the loathsome half-breed,\nlooking in his white linen and elegant clothes a strange contrast to his\nassociates.\n\n“You will bear me witness,” he said in his softest accents, “that I am\nno party to sparing your life. If it rested with me you would die as\nthese other men are about to do. I have no personal grudge against\neither you or them, but I have devoted my life to the destruction of the\nwhite race, and you are the first that has ever been in my power and has\nescaped me. You may thank that stone of yours for your life. These poor\nfellows reverence it, and indeed if it really be what they think it\nis they have cause. Should it prove when we get ashore that they are\nmistaken, and that its shape and material is a mere chance, nothing can\nsave your life. In the meantime we wish to treat you well, so if there\nare any of your possessions which you would like to take with you, you\nare at liberty to get them.” As he finished he gave a sign, and a couple\nof the negroes unbound me, though without removing the gag. I was\nled down into the cabin, where I put a few valuables into my pockets,\ntogether with a pocket-compass and my journal of the voyage. They then\npushed me over the side into a small canoe, which was lying beside the\nlarge one, and my guards followed me, and shoving off began paddling for\nthe shore. We had got about a hundred yards or so from the ship when\nour steersman held up his hand, and the paddlers paused for a moment\nand listened. Then on the silence of the night I heard a sort of dull,\nmoaning sound, followed by a succession of splashes in the water. That\nis all I know of the fate of my poor shipmates. Almost immediately\nafterwards the large canoe followed us, and the deserted ship was left\ndrifting about--a dreary, spectre-like hulk. Nothing was taken from her\nby the savages. The whole fiendish transaction was carried through as\ndecorously and temperately as though it were a religious rite.\n\nThe first grey of daylight was visible in the east as we passed through\nthe surge and reached the shore. Leaving half-a-dozen men with the\ncanoes, the rest of the negroes set off through the sand-hills, leading\nme with them, but treating me very gently and respectfully. It was\ndifficult walking, as we sank over our ankles into the loose, shifting\nsand at every step, and I was nearly dead beat by the time we reached\nthe native village, or town rather, for it was a place of considerable\ndimensions. The houses were conical structures not unlike bee-hives,\nand were made of compressed seaweed cemented over with a rude form of\nmortar, there being neither stick nor stone upon the coast nor anywhere\nwithin many hundreds of miles. As we entered the town an enormous crowd\nof both sexes came swarming out to meet us, beating tom-toms and howling\nand screaming. On seeing me they redoubled their yells and assumed a\nthreatening attitude, which was instantly quelled by a few words shouted\nby my escort. A buzz of wonder succeeded the war-cries and yells of the\nmoment before, and the whole dense mass proceeded down the broad central\nstreet of the town, having my escort and myself in the centre.\n\nMy statement hitherto may seem so strange as to excite doubt in the\nminds of those who do not know me, but it was the fact which I am now\nabout to relate which caused my own brother-in-law to insult me by\ndisbelief. I can but relate the occurrence in the simplest words, and\ntrust to chance and time to prove their truth. In the centre of this\nmain street there was a large building, formed in the same primitive way\nas the others, but towering high above them; a stockade of beautifully\npolished ebony rails was planted all round it, the framework of the door\nwas formed by two magnificent elephant’s tusks sunk in the ground on\neach side and meeting at the top, and the aperture was closed by a\nscreen of native cloth richly embroidered with gold. We made our way\nto this imposing-looking structure, but, on reaching the opening in the\nstockade, the multitude stopped and squatted down upon their hams, while\nI was led through into the enclosure by a few of the chiefs and\nelders of the tribe, Goring accompanying us, and in fact directing the\nproceedings. On reaching the screen which closed the temple--for such it\nevidently was--my hat and my shoes were removed, and I was then led in,\na venerable old negro leading the way carrying in his hand my stone,\nwhich had been taken from my pocket. The building was only lit up by\na few long slits in the roof, through which the tropical sun poured,\nthrowing broad golden bars upon the clay floor, alternating with\nintervals of darkness.\n\nThe interior was even larger than one would have imagined from the\noutside appearance. The walls were hung with native mats, shells, and\nother ornaments, but the remainder of the great space was quite empty,\nwith the exception of a single object in the centre. This was the figure\nof a colossal negro, which I at first thought to be some real king or\nhigh priest of titanic size, but as I approached it I saw by the way in\nwhich the light was reflected from it that it was a statue admirably cut\nin jet-black stone. I was led up to this idol, for such it seemed to be,\nand looking at it closer I saw that though it was perfect in every other\nrespect, one of its ears had been broken short off. The grey-haired\nnegro who held my relic mounted upon a small stool, and stretching up\nhis arm fitted Martha’s black stone on to the jagged surface on the side\nof the statue’s head. There could not be a doubt that the one had been\nbroken off from the other. The parts dovetailed together so accurately\nthat when the old man removed his hand the ear stuck in its place for\na few seconds before dropping into his open palm. The group round\nme prostrated themselves upon the ground at the sight with a cry of\nreverence, while the crowd outside, to whom the result was communicated,\nset up a wild whooping and cheering.\n\nIn a moment I found myself converted from a prisoner into a demi-god.\nI was escorted back through the town in triumph, the people pressing\nforward to touch my clothing and to gather up the dust on which my foot\nhad trod. One of the largest huts was put at my disposal, and a banquet\nof every native delicacy was served me. I still felt, however, that I\nwas not a free man, as several spearmen were placed as a guard at the\nentrance of my hut. All day my mind was occupied with plans of escape,\nbut none seemed in any way feasible. On the one side was the great arid\ndesert stretching away to Timbuctoo, on the other was a sea untraversed\nby vessels. The more I pondered over the problem the more hopeless did\nit seem.\n\nI little dreamed how near I was to its solution.\n\nNight had fallen, and the clamour of the negroes had died gradually\naway. I was stretched on the couch of skins which had been provided\nfor me, and was still meditating over my future, when Goring walked\nstealthily into the hut. My first idea was that he had come to complete\nhis murderous holocaust by making away with me, the last survivor, and\nI sprang up upon my feet, determined to defend myself to the last.\nHe smiled when he saw the action, and motioned me down again while he\nseated himself upon the other end of the couch.\n\n“What do you think of me?” was the astonishing question with which he\ncommenced our conversation.\n\n“Think of you!” I almost yelled. “I think you the vilest, most unnatural\nrenegade that ever polluted the earth. If we were away from these black\ndevils of yours I would strangle you with my hands!”\n\n“Don’t speak so loud,” he said, without the slightest appearance\nof irritation. “I don’t want our chat to be cut short. So you would\nstrangle me, would you!” he went on, with an amused smile. “I suppose I\nam returning good for evil, for I have come to help you to escape.”\n\n“You!” I gasped incredulously.\n\n“Yes, I,” he continued.\n\n“Oh, there is no credit to me in the matter. I am quite consistent.\nThere is no reason why I should not be perfectly candid with you. I wish\nto be king over these fellows--not a very high ambition, certainly, but\nyou know what Caesar said about being first in a village in Gaul. Well,\nthis unlucky stone of yours has not only saved your life, but has turned\nall their heads so that they think you are come down from heaven, and\nmy influence will be gone until you are out of the way. That is why I am\ngoing to help you to escape, since I cannot kill you”--this in the most\nnatural and dulcet voice, as if the desire to do so were a matter of\ncourse.\n\n“You would give the world to ask me a few questions,” he went on, after\na pause; “but you are too proud to do it. Never mind, I’ll tell you one\nor two things, because I want your fellow white men to know them when\nyou go back--if you are lucky enough to get back. About that cursed\nstone of yours, for instance. These negroes, or at least so the legend\ngoes, were Mahometans originally. While Mahomet himself was still alive,\nthere was a schism among his followers, and the smaller party moved away\nfrom Arabia, and eventually crossed Africa. They took away with them, in\ntheir exile, a valuable relic of their old faith in the shape of a large\npiece of the black stone of Mecca. The stone was a meteoric one, as you\nmay have heard, and in its fall upon the earth it broke into two pieces.\nOne of these pieces is still at Mecca. The larger piece was carried away\nto Barbary, where a skilful worker modelled it into the fashion which\nyou saw to-day. These men are the descendants of the original seceders\nfrom Mahomet, and they have brought their relic safely through all their\nwanderings until they settled in this strange place, where the desert\nprotects them from their enemies.”\n\n“And the ear?” I asked, almost involuntarily.\n\n“Oh, that was the same story over again. Some of the tribe wandered away\nto the south a few hundred years ago, and one of them, wishing to have\ngood luck for the enterprise, got into the temple at night and carried\noff one of the ears. There has been a tradition among the negroes ever\nsince that the ear would come back some day. The fellow who carried\nit was caught by some slaver, no doubt, and that was how it got\ninto America, and so into your hands--and you have had the honour of\nfulfilling the prophecy.”\n\nHe paused for a few minutes, resting his head upon his hands, waiting\napparently for me to speak. When he looked up again, the whole\nexpression of his face had changed. His features were firm and set, and\nhe changed the air of half levity with which he had spoken before for\none of sternness and almost ferocity.\n\n“I wish you to carry a message back,” he said, “to the white race,\nthe great dominating race whom I hate and defy. Tell them that I have\nbattened on their blood for twenty years, that I have slain them\nuntil even I became tired of what had once been a joy, that I did this\nunnoticed and unsuspected in the face of every precaution which their\ncivilisation could suggest. There is no satisfaction in revenge when\nyour enemy does not know who has struck him. I am not sorry, therefore,\nto have you as a messenger. There is no need why I should tell you\nhow this great hate became born in me. See this,” and he held up his\nmutilated hand; “that was done by a white man’s knife. My father was\nwhite, my mother was a slave. When he died she was sold again, and I, a\nchild then, saw her lashed to death to break her of some of the little\nairs and graces which her late master had encouraged in her. My young\nwife, too, oh, my young wife!” a shudder ran through his whole frame.\n“No matter! I swore my oath, and I kept it. From Maine to Florida, and\nfrom Boston to San Francisco, you could track my steps by sudden deaths\nwhich baffled the police. I warred against the whole white race as they\nfor centuries had warred against the black one. At last, as I tell you,\nI sickened of blood. Still, the sight of a white face was abhorrent to\nme, and I determined to find some bold free black people and to throw\nin my lot with them, to cultivate their latent powers, and to form\na nucleus for a great coloured nation. This idea possessed me, and I\ntravelled over the world for two years seeking for what I desired. At\nlast I almost despaired of finding it. There was no hope of regeneration\nin the slave-dealing Soudanese, the debased Fantee, or the Americanised\nnegroes of Liberia. I was returning from my quest when chance brought me\nin contact with this magnificent tribe of dwellers in the desert, and I\nthrew in my lot with them. Before doing so, however, my old instinct of\nrevenge prompted me to make one last visit to the United States, and I\nreturned from it in the Marie Celeste.\n\n“As to the voyage itself, your intelligence will have told you by this\ntime that, thanks to my manipulation, both compasses and chronometers\nwere entirely untrustworthy. I alone worked out the course with correct\ninstruments of my own, while the steering was done by my black friends\nunder my guidance. I pushed Tibbs’s wife overboard. What! You look\nsurprised and shrink away. Surely you had guessed that by this time. I\nwould have shot you that day through the partition, but unfortunately\nyou were not there. I tried again afterwards, but you were awake. I shot\nTibbs. I think the idea of suicide was carried out rather neatly.\nOf course when once we got on the coast the rest was simple. I had\nbargained that all on board should die; but that stone of yours upset my\nplans. I also bargained that there should be no plunder. No one can\nsay we are pirates. We have acted from principle, not from any sordid\nmotive.”\n\nI listened in amazement to the summary of his crimes which this strange\nman gave me, all in the quietest and most composed of voices, as though\ndetailing incidents of every-day occurrence. I still seem to see him\nsitting like a hideous nightmare at the end of my couch, with the single\nrude lamp flickering over his cadaverous features.\n\n“And now,” he continued, “there is no difficulty about your escape.\nThese stupid adopted children of mine will say that you have gone back\nto heaven from whence you came. The wind blows off the land. I have\na boat all ready for you, well stored with provisions and water. I am\nanxious to be rid of you, so you may rely that nothing is neglected.\nRise up and follow me.”\n\nI did what he commanded, and he led me through the door of the hut.\n\nThe guards had either been withdrawn, or Goring had arranged matters\nwith them. We passed unchallenged through the town and across the sandy\nplain. Once more I heard the roar of the sea, and saw the long white\nline of the surge. Two figures were standing upon the shore arranging\nthe gear of a small boat. They were the two sailors who had been with us\non the voyage.\n\n“See him safely through the surf,” said Goring. The two men sprang in\nand pushed off, pulling me in after them. With mainsail and jib we ran\nout from the land and passed safely over the bar. Then my two companions\nwithout a word of farewell sprang overboard, and I saw their heads like\nblack dots on the white foam as they made their way back to the shore,\nwhile I scudded away into the blackness of the night. Looking back I\ncaught my last glimpse of Goring. He was standing upon the summit of a\nsand-hill, and the rising moon behind him threw his gaunt angular figure\ninto hard relief. He was waving his arms frantically to and fro; it may\nhave been to encourage me on my way, but the gestures seemed to me at\nthe time to be threatening ones, and I have often thought that it was\nmore likely that his old savage instinct had returned when he realised\nthat I was out of his power. Be that as it may, it was the last that I\never saw or ever shall see of Septimius Goring.\n\nThere is no need for me to dwell upon my solitary voyage. I steered as\nwell as I could for the Canaries, but was picked up upon the fifth day\nby the British and African Steam Navigation Company’s boat Monrovia.\nLet me take this opportunity of tendering my sincerest thanks to Captain\nStornoway and his officers for the great kindness which they showed me\nfrom that time till they landed me in Liverpool, where I was enabled to\ntake one of the Guion boats to New York.\n\nFrom the day on which I found myself once more in the bosom of my family\nI have said little of what I have undergone. The subject is still an\nintensely painful one to me, and the little which I have dropped\nhas been discredited. I now put the facts before the public as they\noccurred, careless how far they may be believed, and simply writing them\ndown because my lung is growing weaker, and I feel the responsibility of\nholding my peace longer. I make no vague statement. Turn to your map of\nAfrica. There above Cape Blanco, where the land trends away north and\nsouth from the westernmost point of the continent, there it is that\nSeptimius Goring still reigns over his dark subjects, unless retribution\nhas overtaken him; and there, where the long green ridges run swiftly in\nto roar and hiss upon the hot yellow sand, it is there that Harton lies\nwith Hyson and the other poor fellows who were done to death in the\nMarie Celeste.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT KEINPLATZ EXPERIMENT.\n\nOf all the sciences which have puzzled the sons of men, none had such\nan attraction for the learned Professor von Baumgarten as those which\nrelate to psychology and the ill-defined relations between mind and\nmatter. A celebrated anatomist, a profound chemist, and one of the first\nphysiologists in Europe, it was a relief for him to turn from these\nsubjects and to bring his varied knowledge to bear upon the study of\nthe soul and the mysterious relationship of spirits. At first, when as a\nyoung man he began to dip into the secrets of mesmerism, his mind seemed\nto be wandering in a strange land where all was chaos and darkness,\nsave that here and there some great unexplainable and disconnected fact\nloomed out in front of him. As the years passed, however, and as the\nworthy Professor’s stock of knowledge increased, for knowledge begets\nknowledge as money bears interest, much which had seemed strange and\nunaccountable began to take another shape in his eyes. New trains of\nreasoning became familiar to him, and he perceived connecting links\nwhere all had been incomprehensible and startling.\n\nBy experiments which extended over twenty years, he obtained a basis\nof facts upon which it was his ambition to build up a new exact science\nwhich should embrace mesmerism, spiritualism, and all cognate subjects.\nIn this he was much helped by his intimate knowledge of the more\nintricate parts of animal physiology which treat of nerve currents and\nthe working of the brain; for Alexis von Baumgarten was Regius Professor\nof Physiology at the University of Keinplatz, and had all the resources\nof the laboratory to aid him in his profound researches.\n\nProfessor von Baumgarten was tall and thin, with a hatchet face and\nsteel-grey eyes, which were singularly bright and penetrating. Much\nthought had furrowed his forehead and contracted his heavy eyebrows, so\nthat he appeared to wear a perpetual frown, which often misled people\nas to his character, for though austere he was tender-hearted. He\nwas popular among the students, who would gather round him after his\nlectures and listen eagerly to his strange theories. Often he would call\nfor volunteers from amongst them in order to conduct some experiment, so\nthat eventually there was hardly a lad in the class who had not, at one\ntime or another, been thrown into a mesmeric trance by his Professor.\n\nOf all these young devotees of science there was none who equalled\nin enthusiasm Fritz von Hartmann. It had often seemed strange to his\nfellow-students that wild, reckless Fritz, as dashing a young fellow\nas ever hailed from the Rhinelands, should devote the time and trouble\nwhich he did in reading up abstruse works and in assisting the Professor\nin his strange experiments. The fact was, however, that Fritz was a\nknowing and long-headed fellow. Months before he had lost his heart\nto young Elise, the blue-eyed, yellow-haired daughter of the lecturer.\nAlthough he had succeeded in learning from her lips that she was not\nindifferent to his suit, he had never dared to announce himself to her\nfamily as a formal suitor. Hence he would have found it a difficult\nmatter to see his young lady had he not adopted the expedient of making\nhimself useful to the Professor. By this means he frequently was asked\nto the old man’s house, where he willingly submitted to be experimented\nupon in any way as long as there was a chance of his receiving one\nbright glance from the eyes of Elise or one touch of her little hand.\n\nYoung Fritz von Hartmann was a handsome lad enough. There were broad\nacres, too, which would descend to him when his father died. To many\nhe would have seemed an eligible suitor; but Madame frowned upon his\npresence in the house, and lectured the Professor at times on his\nallowing such a wolf to prowl around their lamb. To tell the truth,\nFritz had an evil name in Keinplatz. Never was there a riot or a duel,\nor any other mischief afoot, but the young Rhinelander figured as a\nringleader in it. No one used more free and violent language, no one\ndrank more, no one played cards more habitually, no one was more idle,\nsave in the one solitary subject.\n\nNo wonder, then, that the good Frau Professorin gathered her Fraulein\nunder her wing, and resented the attentions of such a mauvais sujet. As\nto the worthy lecturer, he was too much engrossed by his strange studies\nto form an opinion upon the subject one way or the other.\n\nFor many years there was one question which had continually obtruded\nitself upon his thoughts. All his experiments and his theories turned\nupon a single point. A hundred times a day the Professor asked himself\nwhether it was possible for the human spirit to exist apart from\nthe body for a time and then to return to it once again. When the\npossibility first suggested itself to him his scientific mind had\nrevolted from it. It clashed too violently with preconceived ideas\nand the prejudices of his early training. Gradually, however, as he\nproceeded farther and farther along the pathway of original research,\nhis mind shook off its old fetters and became ready to face any\nconclusion which could reconcile the facts. There were many things\nwhich made him believe that it was possible for mind to exist apart\nfrom matter. At last it occurred to him that by a daring and original\nexperiment the question might be definitely decided.\n\n“It is evident,” he remarked in his celebrated article upon invisible\nentities, which appeared in the Keinplatz wochenliche Medicalschrift\nabout this time, and which surprised the whole scientific world--“it\nis evident that under certain conditions the soul or mind does separate\nitself from the body. In the case of a mesmerised person, the body lies\nin a cataleptic condition, but the spirit has left it. Perhaps you reply\nthat the soul is there, but in a dormant condition. I answer that\nthis is not so, otherwise how can one account for the condition of\nclairvoyance, which has fallen into disrepute through the knavery of\ncertain scoundrels, but which can easily be shown to be an undoubted\nfact. I have been able myself, with a sensitive subject, to obtain an\naccurate description of what was going on in another room or another\nhouse. How can such knowledge be accounted for on any hypothesis save\nthat the soul of the subject has left the body and is wandering through\nspace? For a moment it is recalled by the voice of the operator and\nsays what it has seen, and then wings its way once more through the air.\nSince the spirit is by its very nature invisible, we cannot see these\ncomings and goings, but we see their effect in the body of the subject,\nnow rigid and inert, now struggling to narrate impressions which could\nnever have come to it by natural means. There is only one way which I\ncan see by which the fact can be demonstrated. Although we in the flesh\nare unable to see these spirits, yet our own spirits, could we separate\nthem from the body, would be conscious of the presence of others. It is\nmy intention, therefore, shortly to mesmerise one of my pupils. I shall\nthen mesmerise myself in a manner which has become easy to me. After\nthat, if my theory holds good, my spirit will have no difficulty in\nmeeting and communing with the spirit of my pupil, both being separated\nfrom the body. I hope to be able to communicate the result of this\ninteresting experiment in an early number of the Keinplatz wochenliche\nMedicalschrift.”\n\nWhen the good Professor finally fulfilled his promise, and published an\naccount of what occurred, the narrative was so extraordinary that it was\nreceived with general incredulity. The tone of some of the papers was\nso offensive in their comments upon the matter that the angry savant\ndeclared that he would never open his mouth again or refer to the\nsubject in any way--a promise which he has faithfully kept. This\nnarrative has been compiled, however, from the most authentic sources,\nand the events cited in it may be relied upon as substantially correct.\n\nIt happened, then, that shortly after the time when Professor von\nBaumgarten conceived the idea of the above-mentioned experiment, he was\nwalking thoughtfully homewards after a long day in the laboratory, when\nhe met a crowd of roystering students who had just streamed out from a\nbeer-house. At the head of them, half-intoxicated and very noisy, was\nyoung Fritz von Hartmann. The Professor would have passed them, but his\npupil ran across and intercepted him.\n\n“Heh! my worthy master,” he said, taking the old man by the sleeve, and\nleading him down the road with him. “There is something that I have to\nsay to you, and it is easier for me to say it now, when the good beer is\nhumming in my head, than at another time.”\n\n“What is it, then, Fritz?” the physiologist asked, looking at him in\nmild surprise.\n\n“I hear, mein herr, that you are about to do some wondrous experiment in\nwhich you hope to take a man’s soul out of his body, and then to put it\nback again. Is it not so?”\n\n“It is true, Fritz.”\n\n“And have you considered, my dear sir, that you may have some difficulty\nin finding some one on whom to try this? Potztausend! Suppose that the\nsoul went out and would not come back. That would be a bad business. Who\nis to take the risk?”\n\n“But, Fritz,” the Professor cried, very much startled by this view of\nthe matter, “I had relied upon your assistance in the attempt. Surely\nyou will not desert me. Consider the honour and glory.”\n\n“Consider the fiddlesticks!” the student cried angrily. “Am I to be paid\nalways thus? Did I not stand two hours upon a glass insulator while\nyou poured electricity into my body? Have you not stimulated my phrenic\nnerves, besides ruining my digestion with a galvanic current round my\nstomach? Four-and-thirty times you have mesmerised me, and what have I\ngot from all this? Nothing. And now you wish to take my soul out, as you\nwould take the works from a watch. It is more than flesh and blood can\nstand.”\n\n“Dear, dear!” the Professor cried in great distress. “That is very true,\nFritz. I never thought of it before. If you can but suggest how I can\ncompensate you, you will find me ready and willing.”\n\n“Then listen,” said Fritz solemnly. “If you will pledge your word that\nafter this experiment I may have the hand of your daughter, then I am\nwilling to assist you; but if not, I shall have nothing to do with it.\nThese are my only terms.”\n\n“And what would my daughter say to this?” the Professor exclaimed, after\na pause of astonishment.\n\n“Elise would welcome it,” the young man replied. “We have loved each\nother long.”\n\n“Then she shall be yours,” the physiologist said with decision, “for you\nare a good-hearted young man, and one of the best neurotic subjects\nthat I have ever known--that is when you are not under the influence of\nalcohol. My experiment is to be performed upon the fourth of next month.\nYou will attend at the physiological laboratory at twelve o’clock. It\nwill be a great occasion, Fritz. Von Gruben is coming from Jena, and\nHinterstein from Basle. The chief men of science of all South Germany\nwill be there.\n\n“I shall be punctual,” the student said briefly; and so the two parted.\nThe Professor plodded homeward, thinking of the great coming event,\nwhile the young man staggered along after his noisy companions, with\nhis mind full of the blue-eyed Elise, and of the bargain which he had\nconcluded with her father.\n\nThe Professor did not exaggerate when he spoke of the widespread\ninterest excited by his novel psychophysiological experiment. Long\nbefore the hour had arrived the room was filled by a galaxy of talent.\nBesides the celebrities whom he had mentioned, there had come from\nLondon the great Professor Lurcher, who had just established his\nreputation by a remarkable treatise upon cerebral centres. Several great\nlights of the Spiritualistic body had also come a long distance to\nbe present, as had a Swedenborgian minister, who considered that the\nproceedings might throw some light upon the doctrines of the Rosy Cross.\n\nThere was considerable applause from this eminent assembly upon\nthe appearance of Professor von Baumgarten and his subject upon the\nplatform. The lecturer, in a few well-chosen words, explained what his\nviews were, and how he proposed to test them. “I hold,” he said, “that\nwhen a person is under the influence of mesmerism, his spirit is for the\ntime released from his body, and I challenge any one to put forward\nany other hypothesis which will account for the fact of clairvoyance.\nI therefore hope that upon mesmerising my young friend here, and\nthen putting myself into a trance, our spirits may be able to commune\ntogether, though our bodies lie still and inert. After a time nature\nwill resume her sway, our spirits will return into our respective\nbodies, and all will be as before. With your kind permission, we shall\nnow proceed to attempt the experiment.”\n\nThe applause was renewed at this speech, and the audience settled down\nin expectant silence. With a few rapid passes the Professor mesmerised\nthe young man, who sank back in his chair, pale and rigid. He then took\na bright globe of glass from his pocket, and by concentrating his gaze\nupon it and making a strong mental effort, he succeeded in throwing\nhimself into the same condition. It was a strange and impressive sight\nto see the old man and the young sitting together in the same cataleptic\ncondition. Whither, then, had their souls fled? That was the question\nwhich presented itself to each and every one of the spectators.\n\nFive minutes passed, and then ten, and then fifteen, and then fifteen\nmore, while the Professor and his pupil sat stiff and stark upon the\nplatform. During that time not a sound was heard from the assembled\nsavants, but every eye was bent upon the two pale faces, in search of\nthe first signs of returning consciousness. Nearly an hour had elapsed\nbefore the patient watchers were rewarded. A faint flush came back to\nthe cheeks of Professor von Baumgarten. The soul was coming back once\nmore to its earthly tenement. Suddenly he stretched out his long thin\narms, as one awaking from sleep, and rubbing his eyes, stood up from\nhis chair and gazed about him as though he hardly realised where he was.\n“Tausend Teufel!” he exclaimed, rapping out a tremendous South German\noath, to the great astonishment of his audience and to the disgust of\nthe Swedenborgian. “Where the Henker am I then, and what in thunder\nhas occurred? Oh yes, I remember now. One of these nonsensical mesmeric\nexperiments. There is no result this time, for I remember nothing at all\nsince I became unconscious; so you have had all your long journeys for\nnothing, my learned friends, and a very good joke too;” at which the\nRegius Professor of Physiology burst into a roar of laughter and slapped\nhis thigh in a highly indecorous fashion. The audience were so enraged\nat this unseemly behaviour on the part of their host, that there might\nhave been a considerable disturbance, had it not been for the judicious\ninterference of young Fritz von Hartmann, who had now recovered from\nhis lethargy. Stepping to the front of the platform, the young man\napologised for the conduct of his companion. “I am sorry to say,” he\nsaid, “that he is a harum-scarum sort of fellow, although he appeared so\ngrave at the commencement of this experiment. He is still suffering from\nmesmeric reaction, and is hardly accountable for his words. As to the\nexperiment itself, I do not consider it to be a failure. It is very\npossible that our spirits may have been communing in space during this\nhour; but, unfortunately, our gross bodily memory is distinct from our\nspirit, and we cannot recall what has occurred. My energies shall now be\ndevoted to devising some means by which spirits may be able to recollect\nwhat occurs to them in their free state, and I trust that when I have\nworked this out, I may have the pleasure of meeting you all once again\nin this hall, and demonstrating to you the result.” This address, coming\nfrom so young a student, caused considerable astonishment among the\naudience, and some were inclined to be offended, thinking that he\nassumed rather too much importance. The majority, however, looked upon\nhim as a young man of great promise, and many comparisons were made as\nthey left the hall between his dignified conduct and the levity of\nhis professor, who during the above remarks was laughing heartily in a\ncorner, by no means abashed at the failure of the experiment.\n\nNow although all these learned men were filing out of the lecture-room\nunder the impression that they had seen nothing of note, as a matter of\nfact one of the most wonderful things in the whole history of the world\nhad just occurred before their very eyes Professor von Baumgarten had\nbeen so far correct in his theory that both his spirit and that of his\npupil had been for a time absent from his body. But here a strange and\nunforeseen complication had occurred. In their return the spirit of\nFritz von Hartmann had entered into the body of Alexis von Baumgarten,\nand that of Alexis von Baumgarten had taken up its abode in the frame of\nFritz von Hartmann. Hence the slang and scurrility which issued from\nthe lips of the serious Professor, and hence also the weighty words\nand grave statements which fell from the careless student. It was an\nunprecedented event, yet no one knew of it, least of all those whom it\nconcerned.\n\nThe body of the Professor, feeling conscious suddenly of a great\ndryness about the back of the throat, sallied out into the street, still\nchuckling to himself over the result of the experiment, for the soul of\nFritz within was reckless at the thought of the bride whom he had won so\neasily. His first impulse was to go up to the house and see her, but on\nsecond thoughts he came to the conclusion that it would be best to stay\naway until Madame Baumgarten should be informed by her husband of the\nagreement which had been made. He therefore made his way down to the\nGrüner Mann, which was one of the favourite trysting-places of the\nwilder students, and ran, boisterously waving his cane in the air, into\nthe little parlour, where sat Spiegler and Muller and half a dozen other\nboon companions.\n\n“Ha, ha! my boys,” he shouted. “I knew I should find you here. Drink\nup, every one of you, and call for what you like, for I’m going to stand\ntreat to-day.”\n\nHad the green man who is depicted upon the signpost of that well-known\ninn suddenly marched into the room and called for a bottle of wine,\nthe students could not have been more amazed than they were by this\nunexpected entry of their revered professor. They were so astonished\nthat for a minute or two they glared at him in utter bewilderment\nwithout being able to make any reply to his hearty invitation.\n\n“Donner und Blitzen!” shouted the Professor angrily. “What the deuce\nis the matter with you, then? You sit there like a set of stuck pigs\nstaring at me. What is it, then?”\n\n“It is the unexpected honour,” stammered Spiegel, who was in the chair.\n\n“Honour--rubbish!” said the Professor testily. “Do you think that just\nbecause I happen to have been exhibiting mesmerism to a parcel of old\nfossils, I am therefore too proud to associate with dear old friends\nlike you? Come out of that chair, Spiegel my boy, for I shall preside\nnow. Beer, or wine, or shnapps, my lads--call for what you like, and put\nit all down to me.”\n\nNever was there such an afternoon in the Grüner Mann. The foaming\nflagons of lager and the green-necked bottles of Rhenish circulated\nmerrily. By degrees the students lost their shyness in the presence of\ntheir Professor. As for him, he shouted, he sang, he roared, he balanced\na long tobacco-pipe upon his nose, and offered to run a hundred yards\nagainst any member of the company. The Kellner and the barmaid whispered\nto each other outside the door their astonishment at such proceedings on\nthe part of a Regius Professor of the ancient university of Kleinplatz.\nThey had still more to whisper about afterwards, for the learned man\ncracked the Kellner’s crown, and kissed the barmaid behind the kitchen\ndoor.\n\n“Gentlemen,” said the Professor, standing up, albeit somewhat\ntotteringly, at the end of the table, and balancing his high\nold-fashioned wine glass in his bony hand, “I must now explain to you\nwhat is the cause of this festivity.”\n\n“Hear! hear!” roared the students, hammering their beer glasses against\nthe table; “a speech, a speech!--silence for a speech!”\n\n“The fact is, my friends,” said the Professor, beaming through his\nspectacles, “I hope very soon to be married.”\n\n“Married!” cried a student, bolder than the others “Is Madame dead,\nthen?”\n\n“Madame who?”\n\n“Why, Madame von Baumgarten, of course.”\n\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the Professor; “I can see, then, that you know all\nabout my former difficulties. No, she is not dead, but I have reason to\nbelieve that she will not oppose my marriage.”\n\n“That is very accommodating of her,” remarked one of the company.\n\n“In fact,” said the Professor, “I hope that she will now be induced to\naid me in getting a wife. She and I never took to each other very much;\nbut now I hope all that may be ended, and when I marry she will come and\nstay with me.”\n\n“What a happy family!” exclaimed some wag.\n\n“Yes, indeed; and I hope you will come to my wedding, all of you. I\nwon’t mention names, but here is to my little bride!” and the Professor\nwaved his glass in the air.\n\n“Here’s to his little bride!” roared the roysterers, with shouts of\nlaughter. “Here’s her health. Sie soll leben--Hoch!” And so the fun\nwaxed still more fast and furious, while each young fellow followed the\nProfessor’s example, and drank a toast to the girl of his heart.\n\nWhile all this festivity had been going on at the Grüner Mann, a very\ndifferent scene had been enacted elsewhere. Young Fritz von Hartmann,\nwith a solemn face and a reserved manner, had, after the experiment,\nconsulted and adjusted some mathematical instruments; after which,\nwith a few peremptory words to the janitors, he had walked out into the\nstreet and wended his way slowly in the direction of the house of the\nProfessor. As he walked he saw Von Althaus, the professor of anatomy, in\nfront of him, and quickening his pace he overtook him.\n\n“I say, Von Althaus,” he exclaimed, tapping him on the sleeve, “you were\nasking me for some information the other day concerning the middle coat\nof the cerebral arteries. Now I find----”\n\n“Donnerwetter!” shouted Von Althaus, who was a peppery old fellow. “What\nthe deuce do you mean by your impertinence! I’ll have you up before the\nAcademical Senate for this, sir;” with which threat he turned on\nhis heel and hurried away. Von Hartmann was much surprised at this\nreception. “It’s on account of this failure of my experiment,” he said\nto himself, and continued moodily on his way.\n\nFresh surprises were in store for him, however. He was hurrying along\nwhen he was overtaken by two students. These youths, instead of raising\ntheir caps or showing any other sign of respect, gave a wild whoop of\ndelight the instant that they saw him, and rushing at him, seized him\nby each arm and commenced dragging him along with them.\n\n“Gott in himmel!” roared Von Hartmann. “What is the meaning of this\nunparalleled insult? Where are you taking me?”\n\n“To crack a bottle of wine with us,” said the two students. “Come along!\nThat is an invitation which you have never refused.”\n\n“I never heard of such insolence in my life!” cried Von Hartmann. “Let\ngo my arms! I shall certainly have you rusticated for this. Let me go, I\nsay!” and he kicked furiously at his captors.\n\n“Oh, if you choose to turn ill-tempered, you may go where you like,” the\nstudents said, releasing him. “We can do very well without you.”\n\n“I know you. I’ll pay you out,” said Von Hartmann furiously, and\ncontinued in the direction which he imagined to be his own home, much\nincensed at the two episodes which had occurred to him on the way.\n\nNow, Madame von Baumgarten, who was looking out of the window and\nwondering why her husband was late for dinner, was considerably\nastonished to see the young student come stalking down the road. As\nalready remarked, she had a great antipathy to him, and if ever he\nventured into the house it was on sufferance, and under the protection\nof the Professor. Still more astonished was she, therefore, when she\nbeheld him undo the wicket-gate and stride up the garden path with the\nair of one who is master of the situation.\n\nShe could hardly believe her eyes, and hastened to the door with all her\nmaternal instincts up in arms. From the upper windows the fair Elise had\nalso observed this daring move upon the part of her lover, and her heart\nbeat quick with mingled pride and consternation.\n\n“Good day, sir,” Madame Baumgarten remarked to the intruder, as she\nstood in gloomy majesty in the open doorway.\n\n“A very fine day indeed, Martha,” returned the other. “Now, don’t stand\nthere like a statue of Juno, but bustle about and get the dinner ready,\nfor I am well-nigh starved.”\n\n“Martha! Dinner!” ejaculated the lady, falling back in astonishment.\n\n“Yes, dinner, Martha, dinner!” howled Von Hartmann, who was becoming\nirritable. “Is there anything wonderful in that request when a man\nhas been out all day? I’ll wait in the dining-room. Anything will do.\nSchinken, and sausage, and prunes--any little thing that happens to be\nabout. There you are, standing staring again. Woman, will you or will\nyou not stir your legs?”\n\nThis last address, delivered with a perfect shriek of rage, had the\neffect of sending good Madame Baumgarten flying along the passage and\nthrough the kitchen, where she locked herself up in the scullery and\nwent into violent hysterics. In the meantime Von Hartmann strode into\nthe room and threw himself down upon the sofa in the worst of tempers.\n\n“Elise!” he shouted. “Confound the girl! Elise!”\n\nThus roughly summoned, the young lady came timidly downstairs and into\nthe presence of her lover. “Dearest!” she cried, throwing her arms round\nhim, “I know this is all done for my sake! It is a RUSE in order to see\nme.”\n\nVon Hartmann’s indignation at this fresh attack upon him was so great\nthat he became speechless for a minute from rage, and could only glare\nand shake his fists, while he struggled in her embrace. When he at last\nregained his utterance, he indulged in such a bellow of passion that the\nyoung lady dropped back, petrified with fear, into an armchair.\n\n“Never have I passed such a day in my life,” Von Hartmann cried,\nstamping upon the floor. “My experiment has failed. Von Althaus has\ninsulted me. Two students have dragged me along the public road. My wife\nnearly faints when I ask her for dinner, and my daughter flies at me and\nhugs me like a grizzly bear.”\n\n“You are ill, dear,” the young lady cried. “Your mind is wandering. You\nhave not even kissed me once.”\n\n“No, and I don’t intend to either,” Von Hartmann said with decision.\n“You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Why don’t you go and fetch my\nslippers, and help your mother to dish the dinner?”\n\n“And is it for this,” Elise cried, burying her face in her\nhandkerchief--“is it for this that I have loved you passionately for\nupwards of ten months? Is it for this that I have braved my mother’s\nwrath? Oh, you have broken my heart; I am sure you have!” and she sobbed\nhysterically.\n\n“I can’t stand much more of this,” roared Von Hartmann furiously.\n“What the deuce does the girl mean? What did I do ten months ago which\ninspired you with such a particular affection for me? If you are really\nso very fond, you would do better to run away down and find the schinken\nand some bread, instead of talking all this nonsense.”\n\n“Oh, my darling!” cried the unhappy maiden, throwing herself into the\narms of what she imagined to be her lover, “you do but joke in order to\nfrighten your little Elise.”\n\nNow it chanced that at the moment of this unexpected embrace Von\nHartmann was still leaning back against the end of the sofa, which,\nlike much German furniture, was in a somewhat rickety condition. It also\nchanced that beneath this end of the sofa there stood a tank full of\nwater in which the physiologist was conducting certain experiments\nupon the ova of fish, and which he kept in his drawing-room in order\nto insure an equable temperature. The additional weight of the maiden,\ncombined with the impetus with which she hurled herself upon him, caused\nthe precarious piece of furniture to give way, and the body of the\nunfortunate student was hurled backwards into the tank, in which his\nhead and shoulders were firmly wedged, while his lower extremities\nflapped helplessly about in the air. This was the last straw.\nExtricating himself with some difficulty from his unpleasant position,\nVon Hartmann gave an inarticulate yell of fury, and dashing out of the\nroom, in spite of the entreaties of Elise, he seized his hat and rushed\noff into the town, all dripping and dishevelled, with the intention\nof seeking in some inn the food and comfort which he could not find at\nhome.\n\nAs the spirit of Von Baumgarten encased in the body of Von Hartmann\nstrode down the winding pathway which led down to the little town,\nbrooding angrily over his many wrongs, he became aware that an elderly\nman was approaching him who appeared to be in an advanced state of\nintoxication. Von Hartmann waited by the side of the road and watched\nthis individual, who came stumbling along, reeling from one side of\nthe road to the other, and singing a student song in a very husky and\ndrunken voice. At first his interest was merely excited by the fact\nof seeing a man of so venerable an appearance in such a disgraceful\ncondition, but as he approached nearer, he became convinced that he knew\nthe other well, though he could not recall when or where he had met him.\nThis impression became so strong with him, that when the stranger came\nabreast of him he stepped in front of him and took a good look at his\nfeatures.\n\n“Well, sonny,” said the drunken man, surveying Von Hartmann and swaying\nabout in front of him, “where the Henker have I seen you before? I know\nyou as well as I know myself. Who the deuce are you?”\n\n“I am Professor von Baumgarten,” said the student. “May I ask who you\nare? I am strangely familiar with your features.”\n\n“You should never tell lies, young man,” said the other. “You’re\ncertainly not the Professor, for he is an ugly snuffy old chap, and you\nare a big broad-shouldered young fellow. As to myself, I am Fritz von\nHartmann at your service.”\n\n“That you certainly are not,” exclaimed the body of Von Hartmann. “You\nmight very well be his father. But hullo, sir, are you aware that you\nare wearing my studs and my watch-chain?”\n\n“Donnerwetter!” hiccoughed the other. “If those are not the trousers for\nwhich my tailor is about to sue me, may I never taste beer again.”\n\nNow as Von Hartmann, overwhelmed by the many strange things which had\noccurred to him that day, passed his hand over his forehead and cast his\neyes downwards, he chanced to catch the reflection of his own face in a\npool which the rain had left upon the road. To his utter astonishment he\nperceived that his face was that of a youth, that his dress was that of\na fashionable young student, and that in every way he was the antithesis\nof the grave and scholarly figure in which his mind was wont to dwell.\nIn an instant his active brain ran over the series of events which had\noccurred and sprang to the conclusion. He fairly reeled under the blow.\n\n“Himmel!” he cried, “I see it all. Our souls are in the wrong bodies.\nI am you and you are I. My theory is proved--but at what an expense!\nIs the most scholarly mind in Europe to go about with this frivolous\nexterior? Oh the labours of a lifetime are ruined!” and he smote his\nbreast in his despair.\n\n“I say,” remarked the real Von Hartmann from the body of the Professor,\n“I quite see the force of your remarks, but don’t go knocking my body\nabout like that. You received it in excellent condition, but I perceive\nthat you have wet it and bruised it, and spilled snuff over my ruffled\nshirt-front.”\n\n“It matters little,” the other said moodily. “Such as we are so must we\nstay. My theory is triumphantly proved, but the cost is terrible.”\n\n“If I thought so,” said the spirit of the student, “it would be hard\nindeed. What could I do with these stiff old limbs, and how could I woo\nElise and persuade her that I was not her father? No, thank Heaven, in\nspite of the beer which has upset me more than ever it could upset my\nreal self, I can see a way out of it.”\n\n“How?” gasped the Professor.\n\n“Why, by repeating the experiment. Liberate our souls once more, and\nthe chances are that they will find their way back into their respective\nbodies.”\n\nNo drowning man could clutch more eagerly at a straw than did Von\nBaumgarten’s spirit at this suggestion. In feverish haste he dragged his\nown frame to the side of the road and threw it into a mesmeric trance;\nhe then extracted the crystal ball from the pocket, and managed to bring\nhimself into the same condition.\n\nSome students and peasants who chanced to pass during the next hour\nwere much astonished to see the worthy Professor of Physiology and\nhis favourite student both sitting upon a very muddy bank and both\ncompletely insensible. Before the hour was up quite a crowd had\nassembled, and they were discussing the advisability of sending for an\nambulance to convey the pair to hospital, when the learned savant opened\nhis eyes and gazed vacantly around him. For an instant he seemed to\nforget how he had come there, but next moment he astonished his audience\nby waving his skinny arms above his head and crying out in a voice of\nrapture, “Gott sei gedanket! I am myself again. I feel I am!” Nor was\nthe amazement lessened when the student, springing to his feet, burst\ninto the same cry, and the two performed a sort of pas de joie in the\nmiddle of the road.\n\nFor some time after that people had some suspicion of the sanity of both\nthe actors in this strange episode. When the Professor published his\nexperiences in the Medicalschrift as he had promised, he was met by an\nintimation, even from his colleagues, that he would do well to have\nhis mind cared for, and that another such publication would certainly\nconsign him to a madhouse. The student also found by experience that it\nwas wisest to be silent about the matter.\n\nWhen the worthy lecturer returned home that night he did not receive\nthe cordial welcome which he might have looked for after his strange\nadventures. On the contrary, he was roundly upbraided by both his female\nrelatives for smelling of drink and tobacco, and also for being absent\nwhile a young scapegrace invaded the house and insulted its occupants.\nIt was long before the domestic atmosphere of the lecturer’s house\nresumed its normal quiet, and longer still before the genial face of\nVon Hartmann was seen beneath its roof. Perseverance, however, conquers\nevery obstacle, and the student eventually succeeded in pacifying the\nenraged ladies and in establishing himself upon the old footing. He\nhas now no longer any cause to fear the enmity of Madame, for he is\nHauptmann von Hartmann of the Emperor’s own Uhlans, and his loving wife\nElise has already presented him with two little Uhlans as a visible sign\nand token of her affection.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAN FROM ARCHANGEL.\n\n\nOn the fourth day of March, in the year 1867, being at that time in\nmy five-and-twentieth year, I wrote down the following words in my\nnote-book--the result of much mental perturbation and conflict:--\n\n“The solar system, amidst a countless number of other systems as large\nas itself, rolls ever silently through space in the direction of the\nconstellation of Hercules. The great spheres of which it is composed\nspin and spin through the eternal void ceaselessly and noiselessly. Of\nthese one of the smallest and most insignificant is that conglomeration\nof solid and of liquid particles which we have named the earth. It\nwhirls onwards now as it has done before my birth, and will do after my\ndeath--a revolving mystery, coming none know whence, and going none know\nwhither. Upon the outer crust of this moving mass crawl many mites,\nof whom I, John M’Vittie, am one, helpless, impotent, being dragged\naimlessly through space. Yet such is the state of things amongst us that\nthe little energy and glimmering of reason which I possess is entirely\ntaken up with the labours which are necessary in order to procure\ncertain metallic disks, wherewith I may purchase the chemical elements\nnecessary to build up my ever-wasting tissues, and keep a roof over me\nto shelter me from the inclemency of the weather. I thus have no thought\nto expend upon the vital questions which surround me on every side.\nYet, miserable entity as I am, I can still at times feel some degree of\nhappiness, and am even--save the mark!--puffed up occasionally with a\nsense of my own importance.”\n\nThese words, as I have said, I wrote down in my note-book, and they\nreflected accurately the thoughts which I found rooted far down in my\nsoul, ever present and unaffected by the passing emotions of the hour.\nAt last, however, came a time when my uncle, M’Vittie of Glencairn,\ndied--the same who was at one time chairman of committees of the House\nof Commons. He divided his great wealth among his many nephews, and I\nfound myself with sufficient to provide amply for my wants during the\nremainder of my life, and became at the same time owner of a bleak tract\nof land upon the coast of Caithness, which I think the old man must have\nbestowed upon me in derision, for it was sandy and valueless, and he had\never a grim sense of humour. Up to this time I had been an attorney in\na midland town in England. Now I saw that I could put my thoughts into\neffect, and, leaving all petty and sordid aims, could elevate my mind\nby the study of the secrets of nature. My departure from my English home\nwas somewhat accelerated by the fact that I had nearly slain a man in\na quarrel, for my temper was fiery, and I was apt to forget my own\nstrength when enraged. There was no legal action taken in the matter,\nbut the papers yelped at me, and folk looked askance when I met them.\nIt ended by my cursing them and their vile, smoke-polluted town, and\nhurrying to my northern possession, where I might at last find peace and\nan opportunity for solitary study and contemplation. I borrowed from\nmy capital before I went, and so was able to take with me a choice\ncollection of the most modern philosophical instruments and books,\ntogether with chemicals and such other things as I might need in my\nretirement.\n\nThe land which I had inherited was a narrow strip, consisting mostly of\nsand, and extending for rather over two miles round the coast of Mansie\nBay, in Caithness. Upon this strip there had been a rambling, grey-stone\nbuilding--when erected or wherefore none could tell me--and this I had\nrepaired, so that it made a dwelling quite good enough for one of my\nsimple tastes. One room was my laboratory, another my sitting-room, and\nin a third, just under the sloping roof, I slung the hammock in which\nI always slept. There were three other rooms, but I left them vacant,\nexcept one which was given over to the old crone who kept house for me.\nSave the Youngs and the M’Leods, who were fisher-folk living round at\nthe other side of Fergus Ness, there were no other people for many miles\nin each direction. In front of the house was the great bay, behind it\nwere two long barren hills, capped by other loftier ones beyond. There\nwas a glen between the hills, and when the wind was from the land it\nused to sweep down this with a melancholy sough and whisper among the\nbranches of the fir-trees beneath my attic window.\n\nI dislike my fellow-mortals. Justice compels me to add that they appear\nfor the most part to dislike me. I hate their little crawling ways,\ntheir conventionalities, their deceits, their narrow rights and wrongs.\nThey take offence at my brusque outspokenness, my disregard for their\nsocial laws, my impatience of all constraint. Among my books and my\ndrugs in my lonely den at Mansie I could let the great drove of\nthe human race pass onwards with their politics and inventions and\ntittle-tattle, and I remained behind stagnant and happy. Not stagnant\neither, for I was working in my own little groove, and making progress.\nI have reason to believe that Dalton’s atomic theory is founded upon\nerror, and I know that mercury is not an element.\n\nDuring the day I was busy with my distillations and analyses. Often I\nforgot my meals, and when old Madge summoned me to my tea I found my\ndinner lying untouched upon the table. At night I read Bacon, Descartes,\nSpinoza, Kant--all those who have pried into what is unknowable.\nThey are all fruitless and empty, barren of result, but prodigal of\npolysyllables, reminding me of men who, while digging for gold, have\nturned up many worms, and then exhibit them exultantly as being what\nthey sought. At times a restless spirit would come upon me, and I would\nwalk thirty and forty miles without rest or breaking fast. On these\noccasions, when I used to stalk through the country villages, gaunt,\nunshaven, and dishevelled, the mothers would rush into the road and\ndrag their children indoors, and the rustics would swarm out of their\npot-houses to gaze at me. I believe that I was known far and wide as the\n“mad laird o’ Mansie.” It was rarely, however, that I made these raids\ninto the country, for I usually took my exercise upon my own beach,\nwhere I soothed my spirit with strong black tobacco, and made the ocean\nmy friend and my confidant.\n\nWhat companion is there like the great restless, throbbing sea? What\nhuman mood is there which it does not match and sympathise with? There\nare none so gay but that they may feel gayer when they listen to its\nmerry turmoil, and see the long green surges racing in, with the glint\nof the sunbeams in their sparkling crests. But when the grey waves toss\ntheir heads in anger, and the wind screams above them, goading them on\nto madder and more tumultuous efforts, then the darkest-minded of men\nfeels that there is a melancholy principle in Nature which is as gloomy\nas his own thoughts. When it was calm in the Bay of Mansie the surface\nwould be as clear and bright as a sheet of silver, broken only at one\nspot some little way from the shore, where a long black line projected\nout of the water looking like the jagged back of some sleeping monster.\nThis was the top of the dangerous ridge of rocks known to the fishermen\nas the “ragged reef o’ Mansie.” When the wind blew from the east the\nwaves would break upon it like thunder, and the spray would be tossed\nfar over my house and up to the hills behind. The bay itself was a bold\nand noble one, but too much exposed to the northern and eastern gales,\nand too much dreaded for its reef, to be much used by mariners. There\nwas something of romance about this lonely spot. I have lain in my boat\nupon a calm day, and peering over the edge I have seen far down the\nflickering, ghostly forms of great fish--fish, as it seemed to me, such\nas naturalist never knew, and which my imagination transformed into the\ngenii of that desolate bay. Once, as I stood by the brink of the waters\nupon a quiet night, a great cry, as of a woman in hopeless grief, rose\nfrom the bosom of the deep, and swelled out upon the still air, now\nsinking and now rising, for a space of thirty seconds. This I heard with\nmy own ears.\n\nIn this strange spot, with the eternal hills behind me and the eternal\nsea in front, I worked and brooded for more than two years unpestered\nby my fellow men. By degrees I had trained my old servant into habits of\nsilence, so that she now rarely opened her lips, though I doubt not that\nwhen twice a year she visited her relations in Wick, her tongue during\nthose few days made up for its enforced rest. I had come almost to\nforget that I was a member of the human family, and to live entirely\nwith the dead whose books I pored over, when a sudden incident occurred\nwhich threw all my thoughts into a new channel.\n\nThree rough days in June had been succeeded by one calm and peaceful\none. There was not a breath of air that evening. The sun sank down in\nthe west behind a line of purple clouds, and the smooth surface of the\nbay was gashed with scarlet streaks. Along the beach the pools left by\nthe tide showed up like gouts of blood against the yellow sand, as if\nsome wounded giant had toilfully passed that way, and had left these\nred traces of his grievous hurt behind him. As the darkness closed\nin, certain ragged clouds which had lain low on the eastern horizon\ncoalesced and formed a great irregular cumulus. The glass was still low,\nand I knew that there was mischief brewing. About nine o’clock a\ndull moaning sound came up from the sea, as from a creature who, much\nharassed, learns that the hour of suffering has come round again. At ten\na sharp breeze sprang up from the eastward. At eleven it had increased\nto a gale, and by midnight the most furious storm was raging which I\never remember upon that weather-beaten coast.\n\nAs I went to bed the shingle and seaweed were pattering up against my\nattic window, and the wind was screaming as though every gust were a\nlost soul. By that time the sounds of the tempest had become a lullaby\nto me. I knew that the grey walls of the old house would buffet it out,\nand for what occurred in the world outside I had small concern. Old\nMadge was usually as callous to such things as I was myself. It was\na surprise to me when, about three in the morning, I was awoke by the\nsound of a great knocking at my door and excited cries in the wheezy\nvoice of my house-keeper. I sprang out of my hammock, and roughly\ndemanded of her what was the matter.\n\n“Eh, maister, maister!” she screamed in her hateful dialect. “Come doun,\nmun; come doun! There’s a muckle ship gaun ashore on the reef, and the\npuir folks are a’ yammerin’ and ca’in’ for help--and I doobt they’ll a’\nbe drooned. Oh, Maister M’Vittie, come doun!”\n\n“Hold your tongue, you hag!” I shouted back in a passion. “What is it to\nyou whether they are drowned or not? Get back to your bed and leave me\nalone.” I turned in again and drew the blankets over me. “Those men out\nthere,” I said to myself, “have already gone through half the horrors of\ndeath. If they be saved they will but have to go through the same once\nmore in the space of a few brief years. It is best therefore that they\nshould pass away now, since they have suffered that anticipation which\nis more than the pain of dissolution.” With this thought in my mind I\nendeavoured to compose myself to sleep once more, for that philosophy\nwhich had taught me to consider death as a small and trivial incident\nin man’s eternal and everchanging career, had also broken me of much\ncuriosity concerning worldly matters. On this occasion I found, however,\nthat the old leaven still fermented strongly in my soul. I tossed from\nside to side for some minutes endeavouring to beat down the impulses of\nthe moment by the rules of conduct which I had framed during months of\nthought. Then I heard a dull roar amid the wild shriek of the gale,\nand I knew that it was the sound of a signal-gun. Driven by an\nuncontrollable impulse, I rose, dressed, and having lit my pipe, walked\nout on to the beach.\n\nIt was pitch dark when I came outside, and the wind blew with such\nviolence that I had to put my shoulder against it and push my way along\nthe shingle. My face pringled and smarted with the sting of the gravel\nwhich was blown against it, and the red ashes of my pipe streamed away\nbehind me, dancing fantastically through the darkness. I went down to\nwhere the great waves were thundering in, and shading my eyes with\nmy hands to keep off the salt spray, I peered out to sea. I could\ndistinguish nothing, and yet it seemed to me that shouts and great\ninarticulate cries were borne to me by the blasts. Suddenly as I gazed I\nmade out the glint of a light, and then the whole bay and the beach were\nlit up in a moment by a vivid blue glare. They were burning a coloured\nsignal-light on board of the vessel. There she lay on her beam ends\nright in the centre of the jagged reef, hurled over to such an\nangle that I could see all the planking of her deck. She was a large\ntwo-masted schooner, of foreign rig, and lay perhaps a hundred and\neighty or two hundred yards from the shore. Every spar and rope and\nwrithing piece of cordage showed up hard and clear under the livid\nlight which sputtered and flickered from the highest portion of the\nforecastle. Beyond the doomed ship out of the great darkness came the\nlong rolling lines of black waves, never ending, never tiring, with\na petulant tuft of foam here and there upon their crests. Each as it\nreached the broad circle of unnatural light appeared to gather strength\nand volume, and to hurry on more impetuously until, with a roar and\na jarring crash, it sprang upon its victim. Clinging to the weather\nshrouds I could distinctly see some ten or twelve frightened seamen,\nwho, when their light revealed my presence, turned their white faces\ntowards me and waved their hands imploringly. I felt my gorge rise\nagainst these poor cowering worms. Why should they presume to shirk the\nnarrow pathway along which all that is great and noble among mankind has\ntravelled? There was one there who interested me more than they. He was\na tall man, who stood apart from the others, balancing himself upon the\nswaying wreck as though he disdained to cling to rope or bulwark.\nHis hands were clasped behind his back and his head was sunk upon his\nbreast, but even in that despondent attitude there was a litheness\nand decision in his pose and in every motion which marked him as a man\nlittle likely to yield to despair. Indeed, I could see by his occasional\nrapid glances up and down and all around him that he was weighing every\nchance of safety, but though he often gazed across the raging surf to\nwhere he could see my dark figure upon the beach, his self-respect or\nsome other reason forbade him from imploring my help in any way. He\nstood, dark, silent, and inscrutable, looking down on the black sea, and\nwaiting for whatever fortune Fate might send him.\n\nIt seemed to me that that problem would very soon be settled. As I\nlooked, an enormous billow, topping all the others, and coming after\nthem, like a driver following a flock, swept over the vessel. Her\nforemast snapped short off, and the men who clung to the shrouds were\nbrushed away like a swarm of flies. With a rending, riving sound the\nship began to split in two, where the sharp back of the Mansie reef was\nsawing into her keel. The solitary man upon the forecastle ran rapidly\nacross the deck and seized hold of a white bundle which I had already\nobserved but failed to make out. As he lifted it up the light fell upon\nit, and I saw that the object was a woman, with a spar lashed across her\nbody and under her arms in such a way that her head should always rise\nabove water. He bore her tenderly to the side and seemed to speak for a\nminute or so to her, as though explaining the impossibility of remaining\nupon the ship. Her answer was a singular one. I saw her deliberately\nraise her hand and strike him across the face with it. He appeared to\nbe silenced for a moment or so by this, but he addressed her again,\ndirecting her, as far as I could gather from his motions, how she should\nbehave when in the water. She shrank away from him, but he caught her in\nhis arms. He stooped over her for a moment and seemed to press his lips\nagainst her forehead. Then a great wave came welling up against the side\nof the breaking vessel, and leaning over he placed her upon the summit\nof it as gently as a child might be committed to its cradle. I saw her\nwhite dress flickering among the foam on the crest of the dark billow,\nand then the light sank gradually lower, and the riven ship and its\nlonely occupant were hidden from my eyes.\n\nAs I watched those things my manhood overcame my philosophy, and I felt\na frantic impulse to be up and doing. I threw my cynicism to one side as\na garment which I might don again at leisure, and I rushed wildly to my\nboat and my sculls. She was a leaky tub, but what then? Was I, who had\ncast many a wistful, doubtful glance at my opium bottle, to begin now to\nweigh chances and to cavil at danger. I dragged her down to the sea with\nthe strength of a maniac and sprang in. For a moment or two it was a\nquestion whether she could live among the boiling surge, but a dozen\nfrantic strokes took me through it, half full of water but still afloat.\nI was out on the unbroken waves now, at one time climbing, climbing\nup the broad black breast of one, then sinking down, down on the other\nside, until looking up I could see the gleam of the foam all around me\nagainst the dark heavens. Far behind me I could hear the wild wailings\nof old Madge, who, seeing me start, thought no doubt that my madness had\ncome to a climax. As I rowed I peered over my shoulder, until at last on\nthe belly of a great wave which was sweeping towards me I distinguished\nthe vague white outline of the woman. Stooping over, I seized her as she\nswept by me, and with an effort lifted her, all sodden with water, into\nthe boat. There was no need to row back, for the next billow carried us\nin and threw us upon the beach. I dragged the boat out of danger, and\nthen lifting up the woman I carried her to the house, followed by my\nhousekeeper, loud with congratulation and praise.\n\nNow that I had done this thing a reaction set in upon me. I felt that\nmy burden lived, for I heard the faint beat of her heart as I pressed\nmy ear against her side in carrying her. Knowing this, I threw her down\nbeside the fire which Madge had lit, with as little sympathy as though\nshe had been a bundle of fagots. I never glanced at her to see if she\nwere fair or no. For many years I had cared little for the face of a\nwoman. As I lay in my hammock upstairs, however, I heard the old woman\nas she chafed the warmth back into her, crooning a chorus of, “Eh, the\npuir lassie! Eh, the bonnie lassie!” from which I gathered that this\npiece of jetsam was both young and comely.\n\n\nThe morning after the gale was peaceful and sunny. As I walked along the\nlong sweep of sand I could hear the panting of the sea. It was heaving\nand swirling about the reef, but along the shore it rippled in gently\nenough. There was no sign of the schooner, nor was there any wreckage\nupon the beach, which did not surprise me, as I knew there was a great\nundertow in those waters. A couple of broad-winged gulls were hovering\nand skimming over the scene of the shipwreck, as though many strange\nthings were visible to them beneath the waves. At times I could hear\ntheir raucous voices as they spoke to one another of what they saw.\n\nWhen I came back from my walk the woman was waiting at the door for me.\nI began to wish when I saw her that I had never saved her, for here was\nan end of my privacy. She was very young--at the most nineteen, with a\npale somewhat refined face, yellow hair, merry blue eyes, and shining\nteeth. Her beauty was of an ethereal type. She looked so white and light\nand fragile that she might have been the spirit of that storm-foam from\nout of which I plucked her. She had wreathed some of Madge’s garments\nround her in a way which was quaint and not unbecoming. As I strode\nheavily up the pathway, she put out her hands with a pretty child-like\ngesture, and ran down towards me, meaning, as I surmise, to thank me for\nhaving saved her, but I put her aside with a wave of my hand and passed\nher. At this she seemed somewhat hurt, and the tears sprang into\nher eyes, but she followed me into the sitting-room and watched me\nwistfully. “What country do you come from?” I asked her suddenly.\n\nShe smiled when I spoke, but shook her head.\n\n“Francais?” I asked. “Deutsch?” “Espagnol?”--each time she shook her\nhead, and then she rippled off into a long statement in some tongue of\nwhich I could not understand one word.\n\nAfter breakfast was over, however, I got a clue to her nationality.\n\nPassing along the beach once more, I saw that in a cleft of the ridge a\npiece of wood had been jammed. I rowed out to it in my boat, and brought\nit ashore. It was part of the sternpost of a boat, and on it, or rather\non the piece of wood attached to it, was the word “Archangel,” painted\nin strange, quaint lettering.\n\n“So,” I thought, as I paddled slowly back, “this pale damsel is a\nRussian. A fit subject for the White Czar and a proper dweller on\nthe shores of the White Sea!” It seemed to me strange that one of her\napparent refinement should perform so long a journey in so frail\na craft. When I came back into the house, I pronounced the word\n“Archangel” several times in different intonations, but she did not\nappear to recognise it.\n\nI shut myself up in the laboratory all the morning, continuing a\nresearch which I was making upon the nature of the allotropic forms of\ncarbon and of sulphur. When I came out at mid-day for some food she was\nsitting by the table with a needle and thread, mending some rents in her\nclothes, which were now dry. I resented her continued presence, but I\ncould not turn her out on the beach to shift for herself. Presently she\npresented a new phase of her character. Pointing to herself and then\nto the scene of the shipwreck, she held up one finger, by which I\nunderstood her to be asking whether she was the only one saved. I nodded\nmy head to indicate that she was. On this she sprang out of the chair\nwith a cry of great joy, and holding the garment which she was mending\nover her head, and swaying it from side to side with the motion of her\nbody, she danced as lightly as a feather all round the room, and then\nout through the open door into the sunshine. As she whirled round\nshe sang in a plaintive shrill voice some uncouth barbarous chant,\nexpressive of exultation. I called out to her, “Come in, you young\nfiend, come in and be silent!” but she went on with her dance. Then she\nsuddenly ran towards me, and catching my hand before I could pluck\nit away, she kissed it. While we were at dinner she spied one of my\npencils, and taking it up she wrote the two words “Sophie Ramusine” upon\na piece of paper, and then pointed to herself as a sign that that was\nher name. She handed the pencil to me, evidently expecting that I would\nbe equally communicative, but I put it in my pocket as a sign that I\nwished to hold no intercourse with her.\n\nEvery moment of my life now I regretted the unguarded precipitancy with\nwhich I had saved this woman. What was it to me whether she had lived\nor died? I was no young, hot-headed youth to do such things. It was bad\nenough to be compelled to have Madge in the house, but she was old\nand ugly, and could be ignored. This one was young and lively, and so\nfashioned as to divert attention from graver things. Where could I send\nher, and what could I do with her? If I sent information to Wick it\nwould mean that officials and others would come to me and pry, and peep,\nand chatter--a hateful thought. It was better to endure her presence\nthan that.\n\nI soon found that there were fresh troubles in store for me. There is no\nplace safe from the swarming, restless race of which I am a member. In\nthe evening, when the sun was dipping down behind the hills, casting\nthem into dark shadow, but gilding the sands and casting a great glory\nover the sea, I went, as is my custom, for a stroll along the beach.\nSometimes on these occasions I took my book with me. I did so on this\nnight, and stretching myself upon a sand-dune I composed myself to read.\nAs I lay there I suddenly became aware of a shadow which interposed\nitself between the sun and myself. Looking round, I saw to my great\nsurprise a very tall, powerful man, who was standing a few yards off,\nand who, instead of looking at me, was ignoring my existence completely,\nand was gazing over my head with a stern set face at the bay and the\nblack line of the Mansie reef. His complexion was dark, with black hair,\nand short, curling beard, a hawk-like nose, and golden earrings in his\nears--the general effect being wild and somewhat noble. He wore a\nfaded velveteen jacket, a red-flannel shirt, and high sea boots, coming\nhalf-way up his thighs. I recognised him at a glance as being the same\nman who had been left on the wreck the night before.\n\n“Hullo!” I said, in an aggrieved voice. “You got ashore all right,\nthen?”\n\n“Yes,” he answered, in good English. “It was no doing of mine. The waves\nthrew me up. I wish to God I had been allowed to drown!”\n\nThere was a slight foreign lisp in his accent which was rather pleasing.\n“Two good fishermen, who live round yonder point, pulled me out and\ncared for me; yet I could not honestly thank them for it.”\n\n“Ho! ho!” thought I, “here is a man of my own kidney. Why do you wish to\nbe drowned?” I asked.\n\n“Because,” he cried, throwing out his long arms with a passionate,\ndespairing gesture, “there--there in that blue smiling bay, lies my\nsoul, my treasure--everything that I loved and lived for.”\n\n“Well, well,” I said. “People are ruined every day, but there’s no use\nmaking a fuss about it. Let me inform you that this ground on which\nyou walk is my ground, and that the sooner you take yourself off it the\nbetter pleased I shall be. One of you is quite trouble enough.”\n\n“One of us?” he gasped.\n\n“Yes--if you could take her off with you I should be still more\ngrateful.”\n\nHe gazed at me for a moment as if hardly able to realise what I said,\nand then with a wild cry he ran away from me with prodigious speed and\nraced along the sands towards my house. Never before or since have\nI seen a human being run so fast. I followed as rapidly as I could,\nfurious at this threatened invasion, but long before I reached the house\nhe had disappeared through the open door. I heard a great scream\nfrom the inside, and as I came nearer the sound of a man’s bass voice\nspeaking rapidly and loudly. When I looked in the girl, Sophie Ramusine,\nwas crouching in a corner, cowering away, with fear and loathing\nexpressed on her averted face and in every line of her shrinking form.\nThe other, with his dark eyes flashing, and his outstretched hands\nquivering with emotion, was pouring forth a torrent of passionate\npleading words. He made a step forward to her as I entered, but she\nwrithed still further away, and uttered a sharp cry like that of a\nrabbit when the weasel has him by the throat.\n\n“Here!” I said, pulling him back from her. “This is a pretty to-do!\nWhat do you mean? Do you think this is a wayside inn or place of public\naccommodation?”\n\n“Oh, sir,” he said, “excuse me. This woman is my wife, and I feared that\nshe was drowned. You have brought me back to life.”\n\n“Who are you?” I asked roughly.\n\n“I am a man from Archangel,” he said simply; “a Russian man.”\n\n“What is your name?”\n\n“Ourganeff.”\n\n“Ourganeff!--and hers is Sophie Ramusine. She is no wife of yours. She\nhas no ring.”\n\n“We are man and wife in the sight of Heaven,” he said solemnly, looking\nupwards. “We are bound by higher laws than those of earth.” As he spoke\nthe girl slipped behind me and caught me by the other hand, pressing it\nas though beseeching my protection. “Give me up my wife, sir,” he went\non. “Let me take her away from here.”\n\n“Look here, you--whatever your name is,” I said sternly; “I don’t want\nthis wench here. I wish I had never seen her. If she died it would be\nno grief to me. But as to handing her over to you, when it is clear she\nfears and hates you, I won’t do it. So now just clear your great body\nout of this, and leave me to my books. I hope I may never look upon your\nface again.”\n\n“You won’t give her up to me?” he said hoarsely.\n\n“I’ll see you damned first!” I answered.\n\n“Suppose I take her,” he cried, his dark face growing darker.\n\nAll my tigerish blood flushed up in a moment. I picked up a billet of\nwood from beside the fireplace. “Go,” I said, in a low voice; “go quick,\nor I may do you an injury.” He looked at me irresolutely for a moment,\nand then he left the house. He came back again in a moment, however, and\nstood in the doorway looking in at us.\n\n“Have a heed what you do,” he said. “The woman is mine, and I shall have\nher. When it comes to blows, a Russian is as good a man as a Scotchman.”\n\n“We shall see that,” I cried, springing forward, but he was already\ngone, and I could see his tall form moving away through the gathering\ndarkness.\n\nFor a month or more after this things went smoothly with us. I never\nspoke to the Russian girl, nor did she ever address me. Sometimes when\nI was at work in my laboratory she would slip inside the door and sit\nsilently there watching me with her great eyes. At first this intrusion\nannoyed me, but by degrees, finding that she made no attempt to distract\nmy attention, I suffered her to remain. Encouraged by this concession,\nshe gradually came to move the stool on which she sat nearer and nearer\nto my table, until after gaining a little every day during some weeks,\nshe at last worked her way right up to me, and used to perch herself\nbeside me whenever I worked. In this position she used, still without\never obtruding her presence in any way, to make herself very useful\nby holding my pens, test-tubes, or bottles, and handing me whatever I\nwanted, with never-failing sagacity. By ignoring the fact of her being\na human being, and looking upon her as a useful automatic machine,\nI accustomed myself to her presence so far as to miss her on the few\noccasions when she was not at her post. I have a habit of talking aloud\nto myself at times when I work, so as to fix my results better in my\nmind. The girl must have had a surprising memory for sounds, for she\ncould always repeat the words which I let fall in this way, without, of\ncourse, understanding in the least what they meant. I have often been\namused at hearing her discharge a volley of chemical equations and\nalgebraic symbols at old Madge, and then burst into a ringing laugh when\nthe crone would shake her head, under the impression, no doubt, that she\nwas being addressed in Russian.\n\nShe never went more than a few yards from the house, and indeed never\nput her foot over the threshold without looking carefully out of each\nwindow in order to be sure that there was nobody about. By this I\nknew that she suspected that her fellow-countryman was still in the\nneighbourhood, and feared that he might attempt to carry her off. She\ndid something else which was significant. I had an old revolver with\nsome cartridges, which had been thrown away among the rubbish. She found\nthis one day, and at once proceeded to clean it and oil it. She hung\nit up near the door, with the cartridges in a little bag beside it, and\nwhenever I went for a walk, she would take it down and insist upon my\ncarrying it with me. In my absence she would always bolt the door.\nApart from her apprehensions she seemed fairly happy, busying herself\nin helping Madge when she was not attending upon me. She was wonderfully\nnimble-fingered and natty in all domestic duties.\n\nIt was not long before I discovered that her suspicions were well\nfounded, and that this man from Archangel was still lurking in the\nvicinity. Being restless one night I rose and peered out of the window.\nThe weather was somewhat cloudy, and I could barely make out the line\nof the sea, and the loom of my boat upon the beach. As I gazed, however,\nand my eyes became accustomed to the obscurity, I became aware that\nthere was some other dark blur upon the sands, and that in front of\nmy very door, where certainly there had been nothing of the sort the\npreceding night. As I stood at my diamond-paned lattice still peering\nand peeping to make out what this might be, a great bank of clouds\nrolled slowly away from the face of the moon, and a flood of cold, clear\nlight was poured down upon the silent bay and the long sweep of its\ndesolate shores. Then I saw what this was which haunted my doorstep. It\nwas he, the Russian. He squatted there like a gigantic toad, with his\nlegs doubled under him in strange Mongolian fashion, and his eyes fixed\napparently upon the window of the room in which the young girl and the\nhousekeeper slept. The light fell upon his upturned face, and I saw\nonce more the hawk-like grace of his countenance, with the single\ndeeply-indented line of care upon his brow, and the protruding beard\nwhich marks the passionate nature. My first impulse was to shoot him\nas a trespasser, but, as I gazed, my resentment changed into pity and\ncontempt. “Poor fool,” I said to myself, “is it then possible that you,\nwhom I have seen looking open-eyed at present death, should have your\nwhole thoughts and ambition centred upon this wretched slip of a girl--a\ngirl, too, who flies from you and hates you. Most women would love\nyou--were it but for that dark face and great handsome body of\nyours--and yet you must needs hanker after the one in a thousand who\nwill have no traffic with you.” As I returned to my bed I chuckled much\nto myself over this thought. I knew that my bars were strong and my\nbolts thick. It mattered little to me whether this strange man spent his\nnight at my door or a hundred leagues off, so long as he was gone by the\nmorning. As I expected, when I rose and went out there was no sign of\nhim, nor had he left any trace of his midnight vigil.\n\nIt was not long, however, before I saw him again. I had been out for a\nrow one morning, for my head was aching, partly from prolonged stooping,\nand partly from the effects of a noxious drug which I had inhaled the\nnight before. I pulled along the coast some miles, and then, feeling\nthirsty, I landed at a place where I knew that a fresh water stream\ntrickled down into the sea. This rivulet passed through my land, but the\nmouth of it, where I found myself that day, was beyond my boundary line.\nI felt somewhat taken aback when rising from the stream at which I had\nslaked my thirst I found myself face to face with the Russian. I was\nas much a trespasser now as he was, and I could see at a glance that he\nknew it.\n\n“I wish to speak a few words to you,” he said gravely.\n\n“Hurry up, then!” I answered, glancing at my watch. “I have no time to\nlisten to chatter.”\n\n“Chatter!” he repeated angrily. “Ah, but there. You Scotch people are\nstrange men. Your face is hard and your words rough, but so are those\nof the good fishermen with whom I stay, yet I find that beneath it all\nthere lie kind honest natures. No doubt you are kind and good, too, in\nspite of your roughness.”\n\n“In the name of the devil,” I said, “say your say, and go your way.\nI am weary of the sight of you.”\n\n“Can I not soften you in any way?” he cried. “Ah, see--see here”--he\nproduced a small Grecian cross from inside his velvet jacket. “Look at\nthis. Our religions may differ in form, but at least we have some common\nthoughts and feelings when we see this emblem.”\n\n“I am not so sure of that,” I answered.\n\nHe looked at me thoughtfully.\n\n“You are a very strange man,” he said at last. “I cannot understand you.\nYou still stand between me and Sophie. It is a dangerous position to\ntake, sir. Oh, believe me, before it is too late. If you did but know\nwhat I have done to gain that woman--how I have risked my body, how\nI have lost my soul! You are a small obstacle to some which I have\nsurmounted--you, whom a rip with a knife, or a blow from a stone, would\nput out of my way for ever. But God preserve me from that,” he cried\nwildly. “I am deep--too deep--already. Anything rather than that.”\n\n“You would do better to go back to your country,” I said, “than to skulk\nabout these sand-hills and disturb my leisure. When I have proof that\nyou have gone away I shall hand this woman over to the protection of the\nRussian Consul at Edinburgh. Until then, I shall guard her myself, and\nnot you, nor any Muscovite that ever breathed, shall take her from me.”\n\n“And what is your object in keeping me from Sophie?” he asked. “Do you\nimagine that I would injure her? Why, man, I would give my life freely\nto save her from the slightest harm. Why do you do this thing?”\n\n“I do it because it is my good pleasure to act so,” I answered. “I give\nno man reasons for my conduct.”\n\n“Look here!” he cried, suddenly blazing into fury, and advancing towards\nme with his shaggy mane bristling and his brown hands clenched. “If I\nthought you had one dishonest thought towards this girl--if for a moment\nI had reason to believe that you had any base motive for detaining\nher--as sure as there is a God in Heaven I should drag the heart out of\nyour bosom with my hands.” The very idea seemed to have put the man in\na frenzy, for his face was all distorted and his hands opened and shut\nconvulsively. I thought that he was about to spring at my throat.\n\n“Stand off,” I said, putting my hand on my pistol. “If you lay a finger\non me I shall kill you.”\n\nHe put his hand into his pocket, and for a moment I thought he was about\nto produce a weapon too, but instead of that he whipped out a cigarette\nand lit it, breathing the smoke rapidly into his lungs.\n\nNo doubt he had found by experience that this was the most effectual way\nof curbing his passions.\n\n“I told you,” he said in a quieter voice, “that my name is\nOurganeff--Alexis Ourganeff. I am a Finn by birth, but I have spent my\nlife in every part of the world. I was one who could never be still, nor\nsettle down to a quiet existence. After I came to own my own ship there\nis hardly a port from Archangel to Australia which I have not entered.\nI was rough and wild and free, but there was one at home, sir, who was\nprim and white-handed and soft-tongued, skilful in little fancies and\nconceits which women love. This youth by his wiles and tricks stole from\nme the love of the girl whom I had ever marked as my own, and who up to\nthat time had seemed in some sort inclined to return my passion. I had\nbeen on a voyage to Hammerfest for ivory, and coming back unexpectedly\nI learned that my pride and treasure was to be married to this\nsoft-skinned boy, and that the party had actually gone to the church.\nIn such moments, sir, something gives way in my head, and I hardly know\nwhat I do. I landed with a boat’s crew--all men who had sailed with me\nfor years, and who were as true as steel. We went up to the church. They\nwere standing, she and he, before the priest, but the thing had not been\ndone. I dashed between them and caught her round the waist. My men beat\nback the frightened bridegroom and the lookers on. We bore her down to\nthe boat and aboard our vessel, and then getting up anchor we sailed\naway across the White Sea until the spires of Archangel sank down behind\nthe horizon. She had my cabin, my room, every comfort. I slept among\nthe men in the forecastle. I hoped that in time her aversion to me\nwould wear away, and that she would consent to marry me in England or\nin France. For days and days we sailed. We saw the North Cape die away\nbehind us, and we skirted the grey Norwegian coast, but still, in spite\nof every attention, she would not forgive me for tearing her from that\npale-faced lover of hers. Then came this cursed storm which shattered\nboth my ship and my hopes, and has deprived me even of the sight of the\nwoman for whom I have risked so much. Perhaps she may learn to love me\nyet. You, sir,” he said wistfully, “look like one who has seen much of\nthe world. Do you not think that she may come to forget this man and to\nlove me?”\n\n“I am tired of your story,” I said, turning away. “For my part, I think\nyou are a great fool. If you imagine that this love of yours will pass\naway you had best amuse yourself as best you can until it does. If, on\nthe other hand, it is a fixed thing, you cannot do better than cut your\nthroat, for that is the shortest way out of it. I have no more time to\nwaste on the matter.” With this I hurried away and walked down to the\nboat. I never looked round, but I heard the dull sound of his feet upon\nthe sands as he followed me.\n\n“I have told you the beginning of my story,” he said, “and you shall\nknow the end some day. You would do well to let the girl go.”\n\nI never answered him, but pushed the boat off. When I had rowed some\ndistance out I looked back and saw his tall figure upon the yellow\nsand as he stood gazing thoughtfully after me. When I looked again some\nminutes later he had disappeared.\n\nFor a long time after this my life was as regular and as monotonous as\nit had been before the shipwreck. At times I hoped that the man from\nArchangel had gone away altogether, but certain footsteps which I saw\nupon the sand, and more particularly a little pile of cigarette ash\nwhich I found one day behind a hillock from which a view of the house\nmight be obtained, warned me that, though invisible, he was still in\nthe vicinity. My relations with the Russian girl remained the same as\nbefore. Old Madge had been somewhat jealous of her presence at first,\nand seemed to fear that what little authority she had would be taken\naway from her. By degrees, however, as she came to realise my utter\nindifference, she became reconciled to the situation, and, as I have\nsaid before, profited by it, as our visitor performed much of the\ndomestic work.\n\nAnd now I am coming near the end of this narrative of mine, which I have\nwritten a great deal more for my own amusement than for that of any one\nelse. The termination of the strange episode in which these two Russians\nhad played a part was as wild and as sudden as the commencement. The\nevents of one single night freed me from all my troubles, and left me\nonce more alone with my books and my studies, as I had been before their\nintrusion. Let me endeavour to describe how this came about.\n\nI had had a long day of heavy and wearying work, so that in the evening\nI determined upon taking a long walk. When I emerged from the house\nmy attention was attracted by the appearance of the sea. It lay like a\nsheet of glass, so that never a ripple disturbed its surface. Yet\nthe air was filled with that indescribable moaning sound which I have\nalluded to before--a sound as though the spirits of all those who lay\nbeneath those treacherous waters were sending a sad warning of coming\ntroubles to their brethren in the flesh. The fishermen’s wives along\nthat coast know the eerie sound, and look anxiously across the waters\nfor the brown sails making for the land. When I heard it I stepped back\ninto the house and looked at the glass. It was down below 29 degrees.\nThen I knew that a wild night was coming upon us.\n\nUnderneath the hills where I walked that evening it was dull and chill,\nbut their summits were rosy-red, and the sea was brightened by the\nsinking sun. There were no clouds of importance in the sky, yet the\ndull groaning of the sea grew louder and stronger. I saw, far to the\neastward, a brig beating up for Wick, with a reef in her topsails. It\nwas evident that her captain had read the signs of nature as I had done.\nBehind her a long, lurid haze lay low upon the water, concealing the\nhorizon. “I had better push on,” I thought to myself, “or the wind may\nrise before I can get back.”\n\nI suppose I must have been at least half a mile from the house when I\nsuddenly stopped and listened breathlessly. My ears were so accustomed\nto the noises of nature, the sighing of the breeze and the sob of the\nwaves, that any other sound made itself heard at a great distance.\nI waited, listening with all my ears. Yes, there it was again--a\nlong-drawn, shrill cry of despair, ringing over the sands and echoed\nback from the hills behind me--a piteous appeal for aid. It came from\nthe direction of my house. I turned and ran back homewards at the top\nof my speed, ploughing through the sand, racing over the shingle. In my\nmind there was a great dim perception of what had occurred.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the house there is a high sand-hill, from\nwhich the whole country round is visible. When I reached the top of this\nI paused for a moment. There was the old grey building--there the boat.\nEverything seemed to be as I had left it. Even as I gazed, however, the\nshrill scream was repeated, louder than before, and the next moment a\ntall figure emerged from my door, the figure of the Russian sailor. Over\nhis shoulder was the white form of the young girl, and even in his haste\nhe seemed to bear her tenderly and with gentle reverence. I could hear\nher wild cries and see her desperate struggles to break away from him.\nBehind the couple came my old housekeeper, staunch and true, as the aged\ndog, who can no longer bite, still snarls with toothless gums at the\nintruder. She staggered feebly along at the heels of the ravisher,\nwaving her long, thin arms, and hurling, no doubt, volleys of Scotch\ncurses and imprecations at his head. I saw at a glance that he was\nmaking for the boat. A sudden hope sprang up in my soul that I might be\nin time to intercept him. I ran for the beach at the top of my speed. As\nI ran I slipped a cartridge into my revolver. This I determined should\nbe the last of these invasions.\n\nI was too late. By the time I reached the water’s edge he was a hundred\nyards away, making the boat spring with every stroke of his powerful\narms. I uttered a wild cry of impotent anger, and stamped up and down\nthe sands like a maniac. He turned and saw me. Rising from his seat\nhe made me a graceful bow, and waved his hand to me. It was not a\ntriumphant or a derisive gesture. Even my furious and distempered mind\nrecognised it as being a solemn and courteous leave-taking. Then he\nsettled down to his oars once more, and the little skiff shot away out\nover the bay. The sun had gone down now, leaving a single dull, red\nstreak upon the water, which stretched away until it blended with the\npurple haze on the horizon. Gradually the skiff grew smaller and smaller\nas it sped across this lurid band, until the shades of night gathered\nround it and it became a mere blur upon the lonely sea. Then this vague\nloom died away also and darkness settled over it--a darkness which\nshould never more be raised.\n\nAnd why did I pace the solitary shore, hot and wrathful as a wolf whose\nwhelp has been torn from it? Was it that I loved this Muscovite girl?\nNo--a thousand times no. I am not one who, for the sake of a white skin\nor a blue eye, would belie my own life, and change the whole tenor of my\nthoughts and existence. My heart was untouched. But my pride--ah, there\nI had been cruelly wounded.\n\nTo think that I had been unable to afford protection to the helpless\none who craved it of me, and who relied on me! It was that which made my\nheart sick and sent the blood buzzing through my ears.\n\nThat night a great wind rose up from the sea, and the wild waves\nshrieked upon the shore as though they would tear it back with them into\nthe ocean. The turmoil and the uproar were congenial to my vexed spirit.\nAll night I wandered up and down, wet with spray and rain, watching the\ngleam of the white breakers and listening to the outcry of the storm.\nMy heart was bitter against the Russian. I joined my feeble pipe to the\nscreaming of the gale. “If he would but come back again!” I cried with\nclenched hands; “if he would but come back!”\n\nHe came back. When the grey light of morning spread over the eastern\nsky, and lit up the great waste of yellow, tossing waters, with the\nbrown clouds drifting swiftly over them, then I saw him once again. A\nfew hundred yards off along the sand there lay a long dark object,\ncast up by the fury of the waves. It was my boat, much shattered and\nsplintered. A little further on, a vague, shapeless something was\nwashing to and fro in the shallow water, all mixed with shingle and with\nseaweed. I saw at a glance that it was the Russian, face downwards and\ndead. I rushed into the water and dragged him up on to the beach. It was\nonly when I turned him over that I discovered that she was beneath him,\nhis dead arms encircling her, his mangled body still intervening between\nher and the fury of the storm. It seemed that the fierce German Sea\nmight beat the life from him, but with all its strength it was unable to\ntear this one-idea’d man from the woman whom he loved. There were signs\nwhich led me to believe that during that awful night the woman’s fickle\nmind had come at last to learn the worth of the true heart and strong\narm which struggled for her and guarded her so tenderly. Why else should\nher little head be nestling so lovingly on his broad breast, while her\nyellow hair entwined itself with his flowing beard? Why too should there\nbe that bright smile of ineffable happiness and triumph, which death\nitself had not had power to banish from his dusky face? I fancy that\ndeath had been brighter to him than life had ever been.\n\nMadge and I buried them there on the shores of the desolate northern\nsea. They lie in one grave deep down beneath the yellow sand. Strange\nthings may happen in the world around them. Empires may rise and may\nfall, dynasties may perish, great wars may come and go, but, heedless\nof it all, those two shall embrace each other for ever and aye, in\ntheir lonely shrine by the side of the sounding ocean. I sometimes have\nthought that their spirits flit like shadowy sea-mews over the wild\nwaters of the bay. No cross or symbol marks their resting-place, but old\nMadge puts wild flowers upon it at times, and when I pass on my daily\nwalk and see the fresh blossoms scattered over the sand, I think of the\nstrange couple who came from afar, and broke for a little space the dull\ntenor of my sombre life.\n\n\n\n\nTHAT LITTLE SQUARE BOX.\n\n“All aboard?” said the captain.\n\n“All aboard, sir!” said the mate.\n\n“Then stand by to let her go.”\n\nIt was nine o’clock on a Wednesday morning. The good ship Spartan was\nlying off Boston Quay with her cargo under hatches, her passengers\nshipped, and everything prepared for a start. The warning whistle had\nbeen sounded twice; the final bell had been rung. Her bowsprit was\nturned towards England, and the hiss of escaping steam showed that all\nwas ready for her run of three thousand miles. She strained at the warps\nthat held her like a greyhound at its leash.\n\nI have the misfortune to be a very nervous man. A sedentary literary\nlife has helped to increase the morbid love of solitude which, even in\nmy boyhood, was one of my distinguishing characteristics. As I stood\nupon the quarter-deck of the Transatlantic steamer, I bitterly cursed\nthe necessity which drove me back to the land of my forefathers. The\nshouts of the sailors, the rattle of the cordage, the farewells of my\nfellow-passengers, and the cheers of the mob, each and all jarred upon\nmy sensitive nature. I felt sad too. An indescribable feeling, as of\nsome impending calamity, seemed to haunt me. The sea was calm, and the\nbreeze light. There was nothing to disturb the equanimity of the most\nconfirmed of landsmen, yet I felt as if I stood upon the verge of a\ngreat though indefinable danger. I have noticed that such presentiments\noccur often in men of my peculiar temperament, and that they are not\nuncommonly fulfilled. There is a theory that it arises from a species of\nsecond-sight, a subtle spiritual communication with the future. I well\nremember that Herr Raumer, the eminent spiritualist, remarked on one\noccasion that I was the most sensitive subject as regards supernatural\nphenomena that he had ever encountered in the whole of his wide\nexperience. Be that as it may, I certainly felt far from happy as I\nthreaded my way among the weeping, cheering groups which dotted the\nwhite decks of the good ship Spartan. Had I known the experience which\nawaited me in the course of the next twelve hours I should even then at\nthe last moment have sprung upon the shore, and made my escape from the\naccursed vessel.\n\n“Time’s up!” said the captain, closing his chronometer with a snap, and\nreplacing it in his pocket. “Time’s up!” said the mate. There was a last\nwail from the whistle, a rush of friends and relatives upon the land.\nOne warp was loosened, the gangway was being pushed away, when there was\na shout from the bridge, and two men appeared, running rapidly down\nthe quay. They were waving their hands and making frantic gestures,\napparently with the intention of stopping the ship. “Look sharp!”\n shouted the crowd.\n\n“Hold hard!” cried the captain. “Ease her! stop her! Up with the\ngangway!” and the two men sprang aboard just as the second warp parted,\nand a convulsive throb of the engine shot us clear of the shore. There\nwas a cheer from the deck, another from the quay, a mighty fluttering of\nhandkerchiefs, and the great vessel ploughed its way out of the harbour,\nand steamed grandly away across the placid bay.\n\nWe were fairly started upon our fortnight’s voyage. There was a general\ndive among the passengers in quest of berths and luggage, while a\npopping of corks in the saloon proved that more than one bereaved\ntraveller was adopting artificial means for drowning the pangs of\nseparation. I glanced round the deck and took a running inventory of my\ncompagnons de voyage. They presented the usual types met with upon\nthese occasions. There was no striking face among them. I speak as\na connoisseur, for faces are a specialty of mine. I pounce upon a\ncharacteristic feature as a botanist does on a flower, and bear it away\nwith me to analyse at my leisure, and classify and label it in my little\nanthropological museum. There was nothing worthy of me here. Twenty\ntypes of young America going to “Yurrup,” a few respectable middle-aged\ncouples as an antidote, a sprinkling of clergymen and professional men,\nyoung ladies, bagmen, British exclusives, and all the olla podrida of\nan ocean-going steamer. I turned away from them and gazed back at the\nreceding shores of America, and, as a cloud of remembrances rose\nbefore me, my heart warmed towards the land of my adoption. A pile of\nportmanteaus and luggage chanced to be lying on one side of the deck,\nawaiting their turn to be taken below. With my usual love for solitude I\nwalked behind these, and sitting on a coil of rope between them and the\nvessel’s side, I indulged in a melancholy reverie.\n\nI was aroused from this by a whisper behind me. “Here’s a quiet place,”\n said the voice. “Sit down, and we can talk it over in safety.”\n\nGlancing through a chink between two colossal chests, I saw that the\npassengers who had joined us at the last moment were standing at\nthe other side of the pile. They had evidently failed to see me as I\ncrouched in the shadow of the boxes. The one who had spoken was a tall\nand very thin man with a blue-black beard and a colourless face. His\nmanner was nervous and excited. His companion was a short plethoric\nlittle fellow, with a brisk and resolute air. He had a cigar in his\nmouth, and a large ulster slung over his left arm. They both glanced\nround uneasily, as if to ascertain whether they were alone. “This is\njust the place,” I heard the other say. They sat down on a bale of goods\nwith their backs turned towards me, and I found myself, much against my\nwill, playing the unpleasant part of eavesdropper to their conversation.\n\n“Well, Muller,” said the taller of the two, “we’ve got it aboard right\nenough.”\n\n“Yes,” assented the man whom he had addressed as Muller, “it’s safe\naboard.”\n\n“It was rather a near go.”\n\n“It was that, Flannigan.”\n\n“It wouldn’t have done to have missed the ship.”\n\n“No, it would have put our plans out.”\n\n“Ruined them entirely,” said the little man, and puffed furiously at his\ncigar for some minutes.\n\n“I’ve got it here,” he said at last.\n\n“Let me see it.”\n\n“Is no one looking?”\n\n“No, they are nearly all below.”\n\n“We can’t be too careful where so much is at stake,” said Muller, as he\nuncoiled the ulster which hung over his arm, and disclosed a dark object\nwhich he laid upon the deck. One glance at it was enough to cause me to\nspring to my feet with an exclamation of horror. Luckily they were so\nengrossed in the matter on hand that neither of them observed me. Had\nthey turned their heads they would infallibly have seen my pale face\nglaring at them over the pile of boxes.\n\nFrom the first moment of their conversation a horrible misgiving had\ncome over me. It seemed more than confirmed as I gazed at what lay\nbefore me. It was a little square box made of some dark wood, and ribbed\nwith brass. I suppose it was about the size of a cubic foot. It\nreminded me of a pistol-case, only it was decidedly higher. There was\nan appendage to it, however, on which my eyes were riveted, and which\nsuggested the pistol itself rather than its receptacle. This was a\ntrigger-like arrangement upon the lid, to which a coil of string was\nattached. Beside this trigger there was a small square aperture through\nthe wood. The tall man, Flannigan, as his companion called him, applied\nhis eye to this, and peered in for several minutes with an expression of\nintense anxiety upon his face.\n\n“It seems right enough,” he said at last.\n\n“I tried not to shake it,” said his companion.\n\n“Such delicate things need delicate treatment. Put in some of the\nneedful, Muller.”\n\nThe shorter man fumbled in his pocket for some time, and then produced a\nsmall paper packet. He opened this, and took out of it half a handful\nof whitish granules, which he poured down through the hole. A curious\nclicking noise followed from the inside of the box, and both the men\nsmiled in a satisfied way.\n\n“Nothing much wrong there,” said Flannigan.\n\n“Right as a trivet,” answered his companion.\n\n“Look out! here’s some one coming. Take it down to our berth. It\nwouldn’t do to have any one suspecting what our game is, or, worse\nstill, have them fumbling with it, and letting it off by mistake.”\n\n“Well, it would come to the same, whoever let it off,” said Muller.\n\n“They’d be rather astonished if they pulled the trigger,” said the\ntaller, with a sinister laugh. “Ha, ha! fancy their faces! It’s not a\nbad bit of workmanship, I flatter myself.”\n\n“No,” said Muller. “I hear it is your own design, every bit of it, isn’t\nit?”\n\n“Yes, the spring and the sliding shutter are my own.”\n\n“We should take out a patent.”\n\nAnd the two men laughed again with a cold harsh laugh, as they took up\nthe little brass-bound package, and concealed it in Muller’s voluminous\novercoat.\n\n“Come down, and we’ll stow it in our berth,” said Flannigan. “We won’t\nneed it until to-night, and it will be safe there.”\n\nHis companion assented, and the two went arm-in-arm along the deck and\ndisappeared down the hatchway, bearing the mysterious little box away\nwith them. The last words I heard were a muttered injunction from\nFlannigan to carry it carefully, and avoid knocking it against the\nbulwarks.\n\nHow long I remained sitting on that coil of rope I shall never know. The\nhorror of the conversation I had just overheard was aggravated by the\nfirst sinking qualms of sea-sickness. The long roll of the Atlantic\nwas beginning to assert itself over both ship and passengers. I felt\nprostrated in mind and in body, and fell into a state of collapse,\nfrom which I was finally aroused by the hearty voice of our worthy\nquartermaster.\n\n“Do you mind moving out of that, sir?” he said. “We want to get this\nlumber cleared off the deck.”\n\nHis bluff manner and ruddy healthy face seemed to be a positive insult\nto me in my present condition. Had I been a courageous or a muscular\nman I could have struck him. As it was, I treated the honest sailor to a\nmelodramatic scowl which seemed to cause him no small astonishment,\nand strode past him to the other side of the deck. Solitude was what I\nwanted--solitude in which I could brood over the frightful crime which\nwas being hatched before my very eyes. One of the quarter-boats was\nhanging rather low down upon the davits. An idea struck me, and climbing\non the bulwarks, I stepped into the empty boat and lay down in the\nbottom of it. Stretched on my back, with nothing but the blue sky above\nme, and an occasional view of the mizen as the vessel rolled, I was at\nleast alone with my sickness and my thoughts.\n\nI tried to recall the words which had been spoken in the terrible\ndialogue I had overheard. Would they admit of any construction but the\none which stared me in the face? My reason forced me to confess that\nthey would not. I endeavoured to array the various facts which formed\nthe chain of circumstantial evidence, and to find a flaw in it; but\nno, not a link was missing. There was the strange way in which our\npassengers had come aboard, enabling them to evade any examination of\ntheir luggage. The very name of “Flannigan” smacked of Fenianism,\nwhile “Muller” suggested nothing but socialism and murder. Then their\nmysterious manner; their remark that their plans would have been ruined\nhad they missed the ship; their fear of being observed; last, but not\nleast, the clenching evidence in the production of the little square\nbox with the trigger, and their grim joke about the face of the man who\nshould let it off by mistake--could these facts lead to any conclusion\nother than that they were the desperate emissaries of some body,\npolitical or otherwise, who intended to sacrifice themselves, their\nfellow-passengers, and the ship, in one great holocaust? The whitish\ngranules which I had seen one of them pour into the box formed no doubt\na fuse or train for exploding it. I had myself heard a sound come from\nit which might have emanated from some delicate piece of machinery. But\nwhat did they mean by their allusion to to-night? Could it be that they\ncontemplated putting their horrible design into execution on the very\nfirst evening of our voyage? The mere thought of it sent a cold shudder\nover me, and made me for a moment superior even to the agonies of\nsea-sickness.\n\nI have remarked that I am a physical coward. I am a moral one also. It\nis seldom that the two defects are united to such a degree in the one\ncharacter. I have known many men who were most sensitive to bodily\ndanger, and yet were distinguished for the independence and strength of\ntheir minds. In my own case, however, I regret to say that my quiet\nand retiring habits had fostered a nervous dread of doing anything\nremarkable or making myself conspicuous, which exceeded, if possible,\nmy fear of personal peril. An ordinary mortal placed under the\ncircumstances in which I now found myself would have gone at once to the\nCaptain, confessed his fears, and put the matter into his hands. To me,\nhowever, constituted as I am, the idea was most repugnant. The thought\nof becoming the observed of all observers, cross-questioned by a\nstranger, and confronted with two desperate conspirators in the\ncharacter of a denouncer, was hateful to me. Might it not by some remote\npossibility prove that I was mistaken? What would be my feelings if\nthere should turn out to be no grounds for my accusation? No, I would\nprocrastinate; I would keep my eye on the two desperadoes and dog them\nat every turn. Anything was better than the possibility of being wrong.\n\nThen it struck me that even at that moment some new phase of the\nconspiracy might be developing itself. The nervous excitement seemed\nto have driven away my incipient attack of sickness, for I was able to\nstand up and lower myself from the boat without experiencing any return\nof it. I staggered along the deck with the intention of descending into\nthe cabin and finding how my acquaintances of the morning were\noccupying themselves. Just as I had my hand on the companion-rail, I was\nastonished by receiving a hearty slap on the back, which nearly shot me\ndown the steps with more haste than dignity.\n\n“Is that you, Hammond?” said a voice which I seemed to recognise.\n\n“God bless me,” I said, as I turned round, “it can’t be Dick Merton!\nWhy, how are you, old man?”\n\nThis was an unexpected piece of luck in the midst of my perplexities.\nDick was just the man I wanted; kindly and shrewd in his nature, and\nprompt in his actions, I should have no difficulty in telling him my\nsuspicions, and could rely upon his sound sense to point out the best\ncourse to pursue. Since I was a little lad in the second form at\nHarrow, Dick had been my adviser and protector. He saw at a glance that\nsomething had gone wrong with me.\n\n“Hullo!” he said, in his kindly way, “what’s put you about, Hammond? You\nlook as white as a sheet. Mal de mer, eh?”\n\n“No, not that altogether,” said I. “Walk up and down with me, Dick; I\nwant to speak to you. Give me your arm.”\n\nSupporting myself on Dick’s stalwart frame, I tottered along by his\nside; but it was some time before I could muster resolution to speak.\n\n“Have a cigar,” said he, breaking the silence.\n\n“No, thanks,” said I. “Dick, we shall be all corpses to-night.”\n\n“That’s no reason against your having a cigar now,” said Dick, in his\ncool way, but looking hard at me from under his shaggy eyebrows as he\nspoke. He evidently thought that my intellect was a little gone.\n\n“No,” I continued, “it’s no laughing matter; and I speak in sober\nearnest, I assure you. I have discovered an infamous conspiracy,\nDick, to destroy this ship and every soul that is in her;” and I then\nproceeded systematically, and in order, to lay before him the chain of\nevidence which I had collected. “There, Dick,” I said, as I concluded,\n“what do you think of that? and, above all, what am I to do?”\n\nTo my astonishment he burst into a hearty fit of laughter.\n\n“I’d be frightened,” he said, “if any fellow but you had told me as\nmuch. You always had a way, Hammond, of discovering mares’ nests. I like\nto see the old traits breaking out again. Do you remember at school how\nyou swore there was a ghost in the long room, and how it turned out to\nbe your own reflection in the mirror. Why, man,” he continued, “what\nobject would any one have in destroying this ship? We have no great\npolitical guns aboard. On the contrary, the majority of the passengers\nare Americans. Besides, in this sober nineteenth century, the most\nwholesale murderers stop at including themselves among their victims.\nDepend upon it, you have misunderstood them, and have mistaken a\nphotographic camera, or something equally innocent, for an infernal\nmachine.”\n\n“Nothing of the sort, sir,” said I, rather touchily “You will learn to\nyour cost, I fear, that I have neither exaggerated nor misinterpreted a\nword. As to the box, I have certainly never before seen one like it. It\ncontained delicate machinery; of that I am convinced, from the way in\nwhich the men handled it and spoke of it.”\n\n“You’d make out every packet of perishable goods to be a torpedo,” said\nDick, “if that is to be your only test.”\n\n“The man’s name was Flannigan,” I continued.\n\n“I don’t think that would go very far in a court of law,” said Dick;\n“but come, I have finished my cigar. Suppose we go down together and\nsplit a bottle of claret. You can point out these two Orsinis to me if\nthey are still in the cabin.”\n\n“All right,” I answered; “I am determined not to lose sight of them all\nday. Don’t look hard at them, though, for I don’t want them to think\nthat they are being watched.”\n\n“Trust me,” said Dick; “I’ll look as unconscious and guileless as a\nlamb;” and with that we passed down the companion and into the saloon.\n\nA good many passengers were scattered about the great central table,\nsome wrestling with refractory carpet bags and rug-straps, some having\ntheir luncheon, and a few reading and otherwise amusing themselves. The\nobjects of our quest were not there. We passed down the room and peered\ninto every berth, but there was no sign of them. “Heavens!” thought I,\n“perhaps at this very moment they are beneath our feet, in the hold or\nengine-room, preparing their diabolical contrivance!” It was better to\nknow the worst than to remain in such suspense.\n\n“Steward,” said Dick, “are there any other gentlemen about?”\n\n“There’s two in the smoking-room, sir,” answered the steward.\n\nThe smoking-room was a little snuggery, luxuriously fitted up, and\nadjoining the pantry. We pushed the door open and entered. A sigh of\nrelief escaped from my bosom. The very first object on which my eye\nrested was the cadaverous face of Flannigan, with its hard-set mouth\nand unwinking eye. His companion sat opposite to him. They were both\ndrinking, and a pile of cards lay upon the table. They were engaged in\nplaying as we entered. I nudged Dick to show him that we had found\nour quarry, and we sat down beside them with as unconcerned an air\nas possible. The two conspirators seemed to take little notice of our\npresence. I watched them both narrowly. The game at which they were\nplaying was “Napoleon.” Both were adepts at it, and I could not help\nadmiring the consummate nerve of men who, with such a secret at their\nhearts, could devote their minds to the manipulating of a long suit or\nthe finessing of a queen. Money changed hands rapidly; but the run of\nluck seemed to be all against the taller of the two players. At last he\nthrew down his cards on the table with an oath, and refused to go on.\n\n“No, I’m hanged if I do,” he said; “I haven’t had more than two of a\nsuit for five hands.”\n\n“Never mind,” said his comrade, as he gathered up his winnings; “a few\ndollars one way or the other won’t go very far after to-night’s work.”\n\nI was astonished at the rascal’s audacity, but took care to keep my eyes\nfixed abstractedly upon the ceiling, and drank my wine in as unconscious\na manner as possible. I felt that Flannigan was looking towards me with\nhis wolfish eyes to see if I had noticed the allusion. He whispered\nsomething to his companion which I failed to catch. It was a caution, I\nsuppose, for the other answered rather angrily--\n\n“Nonsense! Why shouldn’t I say what I like? Over-caution is just what\nwould ruin us.”\n\n“I believe you want it not to come off,” said Flannigan.\n\n“You believe nothing of the sort,” said the other, speaking rapidly and\nloudly. “You know as well as I do that when I play for a stake I like to\nwin it. But I won’t have my words criticised and cut short by you or any\nother man. I have as much interest in our success as you have--more, I\nhope.”\n\nHe was quite hot about it, and puffed furiously at his cigar for some\nminutes. The eyes of the other ruffian wandered alternately from Dick\nMerton to myself. I knew that I was in the presence of a desperate man,\nthat a quiver of my lip might be the signal for him to plunge a weapon\ninto my heart, but I betrayed more self-command than I should have given\nmyself credit for under such trying circumstances. As to Dick, he was as\nimmovable and apparently as unconscious as the Egyptian Sphinx.\n\nThere was silence for some time in the smoking-room, broken only by the\ncrisp rattle of the cards, as the man Muller shuffled them up before\nreplacing them in his pocket. He still seemed to be somewhat flushed and\nirritable. Throwing the end of his cigar into the spittoon, he glanced\ndefiantly at his companion and turned towards me.\n\n“Can you tell me, sir,” he said, “when this ship will be heard of\nagain?”\n\nThey were both looking at me; but though my face may have turned a\ntrifle paler, my voice was as steady as ever as I answered--\n\n“I presume, sir, that it will be heard of first when it enters\nQueenstown Harbour.”\n\n“Ha, ha!” laughed the angry little man, “I knew you would say that.\nDon’t you kick me under the table, Flannigan, I won’t stand it. I know\nwhat I am doing. You are wrong, sir,” he continued, turning to me,\n“utterly wrong.”\n\n“Some passing ship, perhaps,” suggested Dick.\n\n“No, nor that either.”\n\n“The weather is fine,” I said; “why should we not be heard of at our\ndestination.”\n\n“I didn’t say we shouldn’t be heard of at our destination. Possibly we\nmay not, and in any case that is not where we shall be heard of first.”\n\n“Where then?” asked Dick.\n\n“That you shall never know. Suffice it that a rapid and mysterious\nagency will signal our whereabouts, and that before the day is out. Ha,\nha!” and he chuckled once again.\n\n“Come on deck!” growled his comrade; “you have drunk too much of that\nconfounded brandy-and-water. It has loosened your tongue. Come away!”\n and taking him by the arm he half led him, half forced him out of the\nsmoking-room, and we heard them stumbling up the companion together, and\non to the deck.\n\n“Well, what do you think now?” I gasped, as I turned towards Dick. He\nwas as imperturbable as ever.\n\n“Think!” he said; “why, I think what his companion thinks, that we have\nbeen listening to the ravings of a half-drunken man. The fellow stunk of\nbrandy.”\n\n“Nonsense, Dick I you saw how the other tried to stop his tongue.”\n\n“Of course he did. He didn’t want his friend to make a fool of himself\nbefore strangers. Maybe the short one is a lunatic, and the other his\nprivate keeper. It’s quite possible.”\n\n“O Dick, Dick,” I cried, “how can you be so blind! Don’t you see that\nevery word confirmed our previous suspicion?”\n\n“Humbug, man!” said Dick; “you’re working yourself into a state of\nnervous excitement. Why, what the devil do you make of all that nonsense\nabout a mysterious agent which would signal our whereabouts?”\n\n“I’ll tell you what he meant, Dick,” I said, bending forward and\ngrasping my friend’s arm. “He meant a sudden glare and a flash seen far\nout at sea by some lonely fisherman off the American coast. That’s what\nhe meant.”\n\n“I didn’t think you were such a fool, Hammond,” said Dick Merton\ntestily. “If you try to fix a literal meaning on the twaddle that every\ndrunken man talks, you will come to some queer conclusions. Let us\nfollow their example, and go on deck. You need fresh air, I think.\nDepend upon it, your liver is out of order. A sea-voyage will do you a\nworld of good.”\n\n“If ever I see the end of this one,” I groaned, “I’ll promise never\nto venture on another. They are laying the cloth, so it’s hardly worth\nwhile my going up. I’ll stay below and unpack my things.”\n\n“I hope dinner will find you in a more pleasant state of mind,” said\nDick; and he went out, leaving me to my thoughts until the clang of the\ngreat gong summoned us to the saloon.\n\nMy appetite, I need hardly say, had not been improved by the incidents\nwhich had occurred during the day. I sat down, however, mechanically at\nthe table, and listened to the talk which was going on around me. There\nwere nearly a hundred first-class passengers, and as the wine began to\ncirculate, their voices combined with the clash of the dishes to form\na perfect Babel. I found myself seated between a very stout and nervous\nold lady and a prim little clergyman; and as neither made any advances I\nretired into my shell, and spent my time in observing the appearance of\nmy fellow-voyagers. I could see Dick in the dim distance dividing his\nattentions between a jointless fowl in front of him and a self-possessed\nyoung lady at his side. Captain Dowie was doing the honours at my end,\nwhile the surgeon of the vessel was seated at the other. I was glad to\nnotice that Flannigan was placed almost opposite to me. As long as I had\nhim before my eyes I knew that, for the time at least, we were safe. He\nwas sitting with what was meant to be a sociable smile on his grim face.\nIt did not escape me that he drank largely of wine--so largely that even\nbefore the dessert appeared his voice had become decidedly husky. His\nfriend Muller was seated a few places lower down. He ate little, and\nappeared to be nervous and restless.\n\n“Now, ladies,” said our genial Captain, “I trust that you will consider\nyourselves at home aboard my vessel. I have no fears for the gentlemen.\nA bottle of champagne, steward. Here’s to a fresh breeze and a quick\npassage! I trust our friends in America will hear of our safe arrival in\neight days, or in nine at the very latest.”\n\nI looked up. Quick as was the glance which passed between Flannigan and\nhis confederate, I was able to intercept it. There was an evil smile\nupon the former’s thin lips.\n\nThe conversation rippled on. Politics, the sea, amusements, religion,\neach was in turn discussed. I remained a silent though an interested\nlistener. It struck me that no harm could be done by introducing the\nsubject which was ever in my mind. It could be managed in an off-hand\nway, and would at least have the effect of turning the Captain’s\nthoughts in that direction. I could watch, too, what effect it would\nhave upon the faces of the conspirators.\n\nThere was a sudden lull in the conversation. The ordinary subjects of\ninterest appeared to be exhausted. The opportunity was a favourable one.\n\n“May I ask, Captain,” I said, bending forward and speaking very\ndistinctly, “what you think of Fenian manifestoes?”\n\nThe Captain’s ruddy face became a shade darker from honest indignation.\n\n“They are poor cowardly things,” he said, “as silly as they are wicked.”\n\n“The impotent threats of a set of anonymous scoundrels,” said a\npompous-looking old gentleman beside him.\n\n“O Captain!” said the fat lady at my side, “you don’t really think they\nwould blow up a ship?”\n\n“I have no doubt they would if they could. But I am very sure they shall\nnever blow up mine.”\n\n“May I ask what precautions are taken against them?” asked an elderly\nman at the end of the table.\n\n“All goods sent aboard the ship are strictly examined,” said Captain\nDowie.\n\n“But suppose a man brought explosives aboard with him?” I suggested.\n\n“They are too cowardly to risk their own lives in that way.”\n\nDuring this conversation Flannigan had not betrayed the slightest\ninterest in what was going on. He raised his head now and looked at the\nCaptain.\n\n“Don’t you think you are rather underrating them?” he said. “Every\nsecret society has produced desperate men--why shouldn’t the Fenians\nhave them too? Many men think it a privilege to die in the service of a\ncause which seems right in their eyes, though others may think it wrong.”\n\n“Indiscriminate murder cannot be right in anybody’s eyes,” said the\nlittle clergyman.\n\n“The bombardment of Paris was nothing else,” said Flannigan; “yet the\nwhole civilised world agreed to look on with folded arms, and change\nthe ugly word ‘murder’ into the more euphonious one of ‘war.’ It seemed\nright enough to German eyes; why shouldn’t dynamite seem so to the\nFenian?”\n\n“At any rate their empty vapourings have led to nothing as yet,” said\nthe Captain.\n\n“Excuse me,” returned Flannigan, “but is there not some room for doubt\nyet as to the fate of the Dotterel? I have met men in America who\nasserted from their own personal knowledge that there was a coal torpedo\naboard that vessel.”\n\n“Then they lied,” said the Captain. “It was proved conclusively at the\ncourt-martial to have arisen from an explosion of coal-gas--but we had\nbetter change the subject, or we may cause the ladies to have a restless\nnight;” and the conversation once more drifted back into its original\nchannel.\n\nDuring this little discussion Flannigan had argued his point with a\ngentlemanly deference and a quiet power for which I had not given him\ncredit. I could not help admiring a man who, on the eve of a desperate\nenterprise, could courteously argue upon a point which must touch him so\nnearly. He had, as I have already mentioned, partaken of a considerable\nquantity of wine; but though there was a slight flush upon his pale\ncheek, his manner was as reserved as ever. He did not join in the\nconversation again, but seemed to be lost in thought.\n\nA whirl of conflicting ideas was battling in my own mind. What was I to\ndo? Should I stand up now and denounce them before both passengers and\nCaptain? Should I demand a few minutes’ conversation with the latter in\nhis own cabin, and reveal it all? For an instant I was half resolved to\ndo it, but then the old constitutional timidity came back with redoubled\nforce. After all there might be some mistake. Dick had heard the\nevidence and had refused to believe in it. I determined to let things go\non their course. A strange reckless feeling came over me. Why should I\nhelp men who were blind to their own danger? Surely it was the duty of\nthe officers to protect us, not ours to give warning to them. I drank\noff a couple of glasses of wine, and staggered upon deck with the\ndetermination of keeping my secret locked in my own bosom.\n\nIt was a glorious evening. Even in my excited state of mind I could not\nhelp leaning against the bulwarks and enjoying the refreshing breeze.\nAway to the westward a solitary sail stood out as a dark speck against\nthe great sheet of flame left by the setting sun. I shuddered as I\nlooked at it. It was grand but appalling. A single star was twinkling\nfaintly above our mainmast, but a thousand seemed to gleam in the water\nbelow with every stroke of our propeller. The only blot in the fair\nscene was the great trail of smoke which stretched away behind us like\na black slash upon a crimson curtain. It was hard to believe that\nthe great peace which hung over all Nature could be marred by a poor\nmiserable mortal.\n\n“After all,” I thought, as I gazed into the blue depths beneath me, “if\nthe worst comes to the worst, it is better to die here than to linger in\nagony upon a sick-bed on land.” A man’s life seems a very paltry thing\namid the great forces of Nature. All my philosophy could not prevent my\nshuddering, however, when I turned my head and saw two shadowy figures\nat the other side of the deck, which I had no difficulty in recognising.\nThey seemed to be conversing earnestly, but I had no opportunity of\noverhearing what was said; so I contented myself with pacing up and\ndown, and keeping a vigilant watch upon their movements.\n\nIt was a relief to me when Dick came on deck. Even an incredulous\nconfidant is better than none at all.\n\n“Well, old man,” he said, giving me a facetious dig in the ribs, “we’ve\nnot been blown up yet.”\n\n“No, not yet,” said I; “but that’s no proof that we are not going to\nbe.”\n\n“Nonsense, man!” said Dick; “I can’t conceive what has put this\nextraordinary idea into your head. I have been talking to one of your\nsupposed assassins, and he seems a pleasant fellow enough; quite a\nsporting character, I should think, from the way he speaks.”\n\n“Dick,” I said, “I am as certain that those men have an infernal\nmachine, and that we are on the verge of eternity, as if I saw them\nputting the match to the fuse.”\n\n“Well, if you really think so,” said Dick, half awed for the moment by\nthe earnestness of my manner, “it is your duty to let the Captain know\nof your suspicions.”\n\n“You are right,” I said; “I will. My absurd timidity has prevented my\ndoing so sooner. I believe our lives can only be saved by laying the\nwhole matter before him.”\n\n“Well, go and do it now,” said Dick; “but for goodness’ sake don’t mix\nme up in the matter.”\n\n“I’ll speak to him when he comes off the bridge,” I answered; “and in\nthe meantime I don’t mean to lose sight of them.”\n\n“Let me know of the result,” said my companion; and with a nod he\nstrolled away in search, I fancy, of his partner at the dinner-table.\n\nLeft to myself, I bethought me of my retreat of the morning, and\nclimbing on the bulwark I mounted into the quarter-boat, and lay down\nthere. In it I could reconsider my course of action, and by raising my\nhead I was able at any time to get a view of my disagreeable neighbours.\n\nAn hour passed, and the Captain was still on the bridge. He was talking\nto one of the passengers, a retired naval officer, and the two were deep\nin debate concerning some abstruse point in navigation. I could see the\nred tips of their cigars from where I lay. It was dark now, so dark that\nI could hardly make out the figures of Flannigan and his accomplice.\nThey were still standing in the position which they had taken up after\ndinner. A few of the passengers were scattered about the deck, but\nmany had gone below. A strange stillness seemed to pervade the air. The\nvoices of the watch and the rattle of the wheel were the only sounds\nwhich broke the silence.\n\nAnother half-hour passed. The Captain was still upon the bridge. It\nseemed as if he would never come down. My nerves were in a state of\nunnatural tension, so much so that the sound of two steps upon the deck\nmade me start up in a quiver of excitement. I peered over the edge of\nthe boat, and saw that our suspicious passengers had crossed from the\nother side, and were standing almost directly beneath me. The light of a\nbinnacle fell full upon the ghastly face of the ruffian Flannigan. Even\nin that short glance I saw that Muller had the ulster, whose use I knew\nso well, slung loosely over his arm. I sank back with a groan. It seemed\nthat my fatal procrastination had sacrificed two hundred innocent lives.\n\nI had read of the fiendish vengeance which awaited a spy. I knew that\nmen with their lives in their hands would stick at nothing. All I could\ndo was to cower at the bottom of the boat and listen silently to their\nwhispered talk below.\n\n“This place will do,” said a voice.\n\n“Yes, the leeward side is best.”\n\n“I wonder if the trigger will act?”\n\n“I am sure it will.”\n\n“We were to let it off at ten, were we not?”\n\n“Yes, at ten sharp. We have eight minutes yet.” There was a pause. Then\nthe voice began again--\n\n“They’ll hear the drop of the trigger, won’t they?”\n\n“It doesn’t matter. It will be too late for any one to prevent its going\noff.”\n\n“That’s true. There will be some excitement among those we have left\nbehind, won’t there?”\n\n“Rather. How long do you reckon it will be before they hear of us?”\n\n“The first news will get in at about midnight at earliest.”\n\n“That will be my doing.”\n\n“No, mine.”\n\n“Ha, ha! we’ll settle that.”\n\nThere was a pause here. Then I heard Muller’s voice in a ghastly\nwhisper, “There’s only five minutes more.”\n\nHow slowly the moments seemed to pass! I could count them by the\nthrobbing of my heart.\n\n“It’ll make a sensation on land,” said a voice.\n\n“Yes, it will make a noise in the newspapers.”\n\nI raised my head and peered over the side of the boat. There seemed no\nhope, no help. Death stared me in the face, whether I did or did not\ngive the alarm. The Captain had at last left the bridge. The deck was\ndeserted, save for those two dark figures crouching in the shadow of the\nboat.\n\nFlannigan had a watch lying open in his hand.\n\n“Three minutes more,” he said. “Put it down upon the deck.”\n\n“No, put it here on the bulwarks.”\n\nIt was the little square box. I knew by the sound that they had placed\nit near the davit, and almost exactly under my head.\n\nI looked over again. Flannigan was pouring something out of a paper into\nhis hand. It was white and granular--the same that I had seen him use in\nthe morning. It was meant as a fuse, no doubt, for he shovelled it\ninto the little box, and I heard the strange noise which had previously\narrested my attention.\n\n“A minute and a half more,” he said. “Shall you or I pull the string?”\n\n“I will pull it,” said Muller.\n\nHe was kneeling down and holding the end in his hand. Flannigan stood\nbehind with his arms folded, and an air of grim resolution upon his\nface.\n\nI could stand it no longer. My nervous system seemed to give way in a\nmoment.\n\n“Stop!” I screamed, springing to my feet. “Stop misguided and\nunprincipled men!”\n\nThey both staggered backwards. I fancy they thought I was a spirit, with\nthe moonlight streaming down upon my pale face.\n\nI was brave enough now. I had gone too far to retreat.\n\n“Cain was damned,” I cried, “and he slew but one; would you have the\nblood of two hundred upon your souis?”\n\n“He’s mad!” said Flannigan. “Time’s up. Let it off, Muller.” I sprang\ndown upon the deck.\n\n“You shan’t do it!” I said.\n\n“By what right do you prevent us?”\n\n“By every right, human and divine.”\n\n\n“It’s no business of yours. Clear out of this.”\n\n“Never!” said I.\n\n“Confound the fellow! There’s too much at stake to stand on ceremony.\nI’ll hold him, Muller, while you pull the trigger.”\n\nNext moment I was struggling in the herculean grasp of the Irishman.\nResistance was useless; I was a child in his hands.\n\nHe pinned me up against the side of the vessel, and held me there.\n\n“Now,” he said, “look sharp. He can’t prevent us.”\n\nI felt that I was standing on the verge of eternity. Half-strangled in\nthe arms of the taller ruffian, I saw the other approach the fatal box.\nHe stooped over it and seized the string. I breathed one prayer when I\nsaw his grasp tighten upon it. Then came a sharp snap, a strange rasping\nnoise. The trigger had fallen, the side of the box flew out, and let\noff--TWO GREY CARRIER PIGEONS!\n\nLittle more need be said. It is not a subject on which I care to dwell.\nThe whole thing is too utterly disgusting and absurd. Perhaps the best\nthing I can do is to retire gracefully from the scene, and let the\nsporting correspondent of the New York Herald fill my unworthy place.\nHere is an extract clipped from its columns shortly after our departure\nfrom America:--\n\n“Pigeon-flying Extraordinary.--A novel match has been brought off last\nweek between the birds of John H. Flannigan, of Boston, and Jeremiah\nMuller, a well-known citizen of Lowell. Both men have devoted much time\nand attention to an improved breed of bird, and the challenge is an\nold-standing one. The pigeons were backed to a large amount, and there\nwas considerable local interest in the result. The start was from the\ndeck of the Transatlantic steamship Spartan, at ten o’clock on the\nevening of the day of starting, the vessel being then reckoned to be\nabout a hundred miles from the land. The bird which reached home first\nwas to be declared the winner. Considerable caution had, we believe, to\nbe observed, as some captains have a prejudice against the bringing\noff of sporting events aboard their vessels. In spite of some little\ndifficulty at the last moment, the trap was sprung almost exactly at ten\no’clock.\n\n“Muller’s bird arrived in Lowell in an extreme state of exhaustion on the\nfollowing morning, while Flannigan’s has not been heard of. The backers\nof the latter have the satisfaction of knowing, however, that the whole\naffair has been characterised by extreme fairness. The pigeons were\nconfined in a specially invented trap, which could only be opened by\nthe spring. It was thus possible to feed them through an aperture in the\ntop, but any tampering with their wings was quite out of the question.\nA few such matches would go far towards popularising pigeon-flying in\nAmerica, and form an agreeable variety to the morbid exhibitions of\nhuman endurance which have assumed such proportions during the last few\nyears.”\n\n\n\n\nJOHN HUXFORD’S HIATUS.\n\nStrange it is and wonderful to mark how upon this planet of ours the\nsmallest and most insignificant of events set a train of consequences in\nmotion which act and react until their final results are portentous and\nincalculable. Set a force rolling, however small; and who can say where\nit shall end, or what it may lead to! Trifles develop into tragedies,\nand the bagatelle of one day ripens into the catastrophe of the next.\nAn oyster throws out a secretion to surround a grain of sand, and so a\npearl comes into being; a pearl diver fishes it up, a merchant buys\nit and sells it to a jeweller, who disposes of it to a customer. The\ncustomer is robbed of it by two scoundrels who quarrel over the booty.\nOne slays the other, and perishes himself upon the scaffold. Here is\na direct chain of events with a sick mollusc for its first link, and a\ngallows for its last one. Had that grain of sand not chanced to wash in\nbetween the shells of the bivalve, two living breathing beings with all\ntheir potentialities for good and for evil would not have been blotted\nout from among their fellows. Who shall undertake to judge what is\nreally small and what is great?\n\nThus when in the year 1821 Don Diego Salvador bethought him that if it\npaid the heretics in England to import the bark of his cork oaks, it\nwould pay him also to found a factory by which the corks might be cut\nand sent out ready made, surely at first sight no very vital human\ninterests would appear to be affected. Yet there were poor folk who\nwould suffer, and suffer acutely--women who would weep, and men who\nwould become sallow and hungry-looking and dangerous in places of which\nthe Don had never heard, and all on account of that one idea which had\nflashed across him as he strutted, cigarettiferous, beneath the grateful\nshadow of his limes. So crowded is this old globe of ours, and so\ninterlaced our interests, that one cannot think a new thought without\nsome poor devil being the better or the worse for it.\n\nDon Diego Salvador was a capitalist, and the abstract thought soon took\nthe concrete form of a great square plastered building wherein a couple\nof hundred of his swarthy countrymen worked with deft nimble fingers at\na rate of pay which no English artisan could have accepted. Within a few\nmonths the result of this new competition was an abrupt fall of prices\nin the trade, which was serious for the largest firms and disastrous\nfor the smaller ones. A few old-established houses held on as they were,\nothers reduced their establishments and cut down their expenses, while\none or two put up their shutters and confessed themselves beaten. In\nthis last unfortunate category was the ancient and respected firm of\nFairbairn Brothers of Brisport.\n\nSeveral causes had led up to this disaster, though Don Diego’s debut as\na corkcutter had brought matters to a head. When a couple of generations\nback the original Fairbairn had founded the business, Brisport was a\nlittle fishing town with no outlet or occupation for her superfluous\npopulation. Men were glad to have safe and continuous work upon any\nterms. All this was altered now, for the town was expanding into the\ncentre of a large district in the west, and the demand for labour and\nits remuneration had proportionately increased. Again, in the old days,\nwhen carriage was ruinous and communication slow, the vintners of Exeter\nand of Barnstaple were glad to buy their corks from their neighbour of\nBrisport; but now the large London houses sent down their travellers,\nwho competed with each other to gain the local custom, until profits\nwere cut down to the vanishing point. For a long time the firm had been\nin a precarious position, but this further drop in prices settled the\nmatter, and compelled Mr. Charles Fairbairn, the acting manager, to\nclose his establishment.\n\nIt was a murky, foggy Saturday afternoon in November when the hands\nwere paid for the last time, and the old building was to be finally\nabandoned. Mr. Fairbairn, an anxious-faced, sorrow-worn man, stood on\na raised dais by the cashier while he handed the little pile of\nhardly-earned shillings and coppers to each successive workman as the\nlong procession filed past his table. It was usual with the employees to\nclatter away the instant that they had been paid, like so many children\nlet out of school; but to-day they waited, forming little groups over\nthe great dreary room, and discussing in subdued voices the misfortune\nwhich had come upon their employers, and the future which awaited\nthemselves. When the last pile of coins had been handed across the\ntable, and the last name checked by the cashier, the whole throng\nfaced silently round to the man who had been their master, and waited\nexpectantly for any words which he might have to say to them.\n\nMr. Charles Fairbairn had not expected this, and it embarrassed him. He\nhad waited as a matter of routine duty until the wages were paid, but\nhe was a taciturn, slow-witted man, and he had not foreseen this sudden\ncall upon his oratorical powers. He stroked his thin cheek nervously\nwith his long white fingers, and looked down with weak watery eyes at\nthe mosaic of upturned serious faces.\n\n“I am sorry that we have to part, my men,” he said at last in a\ncrackling voice. “It’s a bad day for all of us, and for Brisport too.\nFor three years we have been losing money over the works. We held on in\nthe hope of a change coming, but matters are going from bad to worse.\nThere’s nothing for it but to give it up before the balance of our\nfortune is swallowed up. I hope you may all be able to get work of some\nsort before very long. Good-bye, and God bless you!”\n\n“God bless you, sir! God bless you!” cried a chorus of rough voices.\n“Three cheers for Mr. Charles Fairbairn!” shouted a bright-eyed, smart\nyoung fellow, springing up upon a bench and waving his peaked cap in the\nair. The crowd responded to the call, but their huzzas wanted the true\nring which only a joyous heart can give. Then they began to flock out\ninto the sunlight, looking back as they went at the long deal tables and\nthe cork-strewn floor--above all at the sad-faced, solitary man,\nwhose cheeks were flecked with colour at the rough cordiality of their\nfarewell.\n\n“Huxford,” said the cashier, touching on the shoulder the young fellow\nwho had led the cheering; “the governor wants to speak to you.”\n\nThe workman turned back and stood swinging his cap awkwardly in front of\nhis ex-employer, while the crowd pushed on until the doorway was clear,\nand the heavy fog-wreaths rolled unchecked into the deserted factory.\n\n“Ah, John!” said Mr. Fairbairn, coming suddenly out of his reverie and\ntaking up a letter from the table. “You have been in my service since\nyou were a boy, and you have shown that you merited the trust which I\nhave placed in you. From what I have heard I think I am right in saying\nthat this sudden want of work will affect your plans more than it will\nmany of my other hands.”\n\n“I was to be married at Shrovetide,” the man answered, tracing a pattern\nupon the table with his horny forefinger. “I’ll have to find work\nfirst.”\n\n“And work, my poor fellow, is by no means easy to find. You see you have\nbeen in this groove all your life, and are unfit for anything else.\nIt’s true you’ve been my foreman, but even that won’t help you, for\nthe factories all over England are discharging hands, and there’s not a\nvacancy to be had. It’s a bad outlook for you and such as you.”\n\n“What would you advise, then, sir?” asked John Huxford.\n\n“That’s what I was coming to. I have a letter here from Sheridan and\nMoore, of Montreal, asking for a good hand to take charge of a workroom.\nIf you think it will suit you, you can go out by the next boat. The\nwages are far in excess of anything which I have been able to give you.”\n\n“Why, sir, this is real kind of you,” the young workman said earnestly.\n“She--my girl--Mary, will be as grateful to you as I am. I know what you\nsay is right, and that if I had to look for work I should be likely to\nspend the little that I have laid by towards housekeeping before I found\nit. But, sir, with your leave I’d like to speak to her about it before I\nmade up my mind. Could you leave it open for a few hours?”\n\n“The mail goes out to-morrow,” Mr. Fairbairn answered. “If you decide to\naccept you can write tonight. Here is their letter, which will give you\ntheir address.”\n\nJohn Huxford took the precious paper with a grateful heart. An hour ago\nhis future had been all black, but now this rift of light had broken in\nthe west, giving promise of better things. He would have liked to have\nsaid something expressive of his feelings to his employer, but the\nEnglish nature is not effusive, and he could not get beyond a\nfew choking awkward words which were as awkwardly received by his\nbenefactor. With a scrape and a bow, he turned on his heel, and plunged\nout into the foggy street.\n\nSo thick was the vapour that the houses over the way were only a vague\nloom, but the foreman hurried on with springy steps through side streets\nand winding lanes, past walls where the fishermen’s nets were drying,\nand over cobble-stoned alleys redolent of herring, until he reached a\nmodest line of whitewashed cottages fronting the sea. At the door of one\nof these the young man tapped, and then without waiting for a response,\npressed down the latch and walked in.\n\nAn old silvery-haired woman and a young girl hardly out of her teens\nwere sitting on either side of the fire, and the latter sprang to her\nfeet as he entered.\n\n“You’ve got some good news, John,” she cried, putting her hands upon his\nshoulders, and looking into his eyes. “I can tell it from your step. Mr.\nFairbairn is going to carry on after all.”\n\n“No, dear, not so good as that,” John Huxford answered, smoothing back\nher rich brown hair; “but I have an offer of a place in Canada, with\ngood money, and if you think as I do, I shall go out to it, and you can\nfollow with the granny whenever I have made all straight for you at the\nother side. What say you to that, my lass?”\n\n“Why, surely, John, what you think is right must be for the best,” said\nthe girl quietly, with trust and confidence in her pale plain face and\nloving hazel eyes. “But poor granny, how is she to cross the seas?”\n\n“Oh, never mind about me,” the old woman broke in cheerfully. “I’ll be\nno drag on you. If you want granny, granny’s not too old to travel; and\nif you don’t want her, why she can look after the cottage, and have an\nEnglish home ready for you whenever you turn back to the old country.”\n\n“Of course we shall need you, granny,” John Huxford said, with a cheery\nlaugh. “Fancy leaving granny behind! That would never do! Mary! But\nif you both come out, and if we are married all snug and proper at\nMontreal, we’ll look through the whole city until we find a house\nsomething like this one, and we’ll have creepers on the outside just\nthe same, and when the doors are shut and we sit round the fire on the\nwinter’s nights, I’m hanged if we’ll be able to tell that we’re not at\nhome. Besides, Mary, it’s the same speech out there, and the same king\nand the same flag; it’s not like a foreign country.”\n\n“No, of course not,” Mary answered with conviction. She was an orphan\nwith no living relation save her old grandmother, and no thought in life\nbut to make a helpful and worthy wife to the man she loved. Where these\ntwo were she could not fail to find happiness. If John went to Canada,\nthen Canada became home to her, for what had Brisport to offer when he\nwas gone?\n\n“I’m to write to-night then and accept?” the young man asked. “I knew\nyou would both be of the same mind as myself, but of course I couldn’t\nclose with the offer until we had talked it over. I can get started in a\nweek or two, and then in a couple of months I’ll have all ready for you\non the other side.”\n\n“It will be a weary, weary time until we hear from you, dear John,” said\nMary, clasping his hand; “but it’s God’s will, and we must be patient.\nHere’s pen and ink. You can sit at the table and write the letter which\nis to take the three of us across the Atlantic.” Strange how Don Diego’s\nthoughts were moulding human lives in the little Devon village.\n\nThe acceptance was duly despatched, and John Huxford began immediately\nto prepare for his departure, for the Montreal firm had intimated that\nthe vacancy was a certainty, and that the chosen man might come out\nwithout delay to take over his duties. In a very few days his scanty\noutfit was completed, and he started off in a coasting vessel for\nLiverpool, where he was to catch the passenger ship for Quebec.\n\n“Remember, John,” Mary whispered, as he pressed her to his heart upon\nthe Brisport quay, “the cottage is our own, and come what may, we have\nalways that to fall back upon. If things should chance to turn out badly\nover there, we have always a roof to cover us. There you will find me\nuntil you send word to us to come.”\n\n“And that will be very soon, my lass,” he answered cheerfully, with a\nlast embrace. “Good-bye, granny, good-bye.” The ship was a mile and more\nfrom the land before he lost sight of the figures of the straight slim\ngirl and her old companion, who stood watching and waving to him from\nthe end of the grey stone quay. It was with a sinking heart and a vague\nfeeling of impending disaster that he saw them at last as minute specks\nin the distance, walking townward and disappearing amid the crowd who\nlined the beach.\n\nFrom Liverpool the old woman and her granddaughter received a letter\nfrom John announcing that he was just starting in the barque St.\nLawrence, and six weeks afterwards a second longer epistle informed them\nof his safe arrival at Quebec, and gave them his first impressions of\nthe country. After that a long unbroken silence set in. Week after week\nand month after month passed by, and never a word came from across the\nseas. A year went over their heads, and yet another, but no news of the\nabsentee. Sheridan and Moore were written to, and replied that though\nJohn Huxford’s letter had reached them, he had never presented himself,\nand they had been forced to fill up the vacancy as best they could.\nStill Mary and her grandmother hoped against hope, and looked out\nfor the letter-carrier every morning with such eagerness, that the\nkind-hearted man would often make a detour rather than pass the two\npale anxious faces which peered at him from the cottage window. At last,\nthree years after the young foreman’s disappearance, old granny died,\nand Mary was left alone, a broken sorrowful woman, living as best she\nmight on a small annuity which had descended to her, and eating her\nheart out as she brooded over the mystery which hung over the fate of\nher lover.\n\nAmong the shrewd west-country neighbours there had long, however, ceased\nto be any mystery in the matter. Huxford arrived safely in Canada--so\nmuch was proved by his letter. Had he met with his end in any sudden\nway during the journey between Quebec and Montreal, there must have\nbeen some official inquiry, and his luggage would have sufficed to have\nestablished his identity. Yet the Canadian police had been communicated\nwith, and had returned a positive answer that no inquest had been held,\nor any body found, which could by any possibility be that of the young\nEnglishman. The only alternative appeared to be that he had taken the\nfirst opportunity to break all the old ties, and had slipped away to the\nbackwoods or to the States to commence life anew under an altered name.\nWhy he should do this no one professed to know, but that he had done it\nappeared only too probable from the facts. Hence many a deep growl of\nrighteous anger rose from the brawny smacksmen when Mary with her pale\nface and sorrow-sunken head passed along the quays on her way to her\ndaily marketing; and it is more than likely that if the missing man had\nturned up in Brisport he might have met with some rough words or rougher\nusage, unless he could give some very good reason for his strange\nconduct. This popular view of the case never, however, occurred to the\nsimple trusting heart of the lonely girl, and as the years rolled by her\ngrief and her suspense were never for an instant tinged with a doubt as\nto the good faith of the missing man. From youth she grew into middle\nage, and from that into the autumn of her life, patient, long-suffering,\nand faithful, doing good as far as lay in her power, and waiting humbly\nuntil fate should restore either in this world or the next that which it\nhad so mysteriously deprived her of.\n\nIn the meantime neither the opinion held by the minority that John\nHuxford was dead, nor that of the majority, which pronounced him to be\nfaithless, represented the true state of the case. Still alive, and of\nstainless honour, he had yet been singled out by fortune as her victim\nin one of those strange freaks which are of such rare occurrence, and so\nbeyond the general experience, that they might be put by as incredible,\nhad we not the most trustworthy evidence of their occasional\npossibility.\n\nLanding at Quebec, with his heart full of hope and courage, John\nselected a dingy room in a back street, where the terms were less\nexorbitant than elsewhere, and conveyed thither the two boxes which\ncontained his worldly goods. After taking up his quarters there he had\nhalf a mind to change again, for the landlady and the fellow-lodgers\nwere by no means to his taste; but the Montreal coach started within a\nday or two, and he consoled himself by the thought that the discomfort\nwould only last for that short time. Having written home to Mary to\nannounce his safe arrival, he employed himself in seeing as much of the\ntown as was possible, walking about all day, and only returning to his\nroom at night.\n\nIt happened, however, that the house on which the unfortunate youth had\npitched was one which was notorious for the character of its inmates.\nHe had been directed to it by a pimp, who found regular employment\nin hanging about the docks and decoying new-comers to this den.\nThe fellow’s specious manner and proffered civility had led the\nsimple-hearted west-countryman into the toils, and though his instinct\ntold him that he was in unsafe company, he refrained, unfortunately,\nfrom at once making his escape. He contented himself with staying out\nall day, and associating as little as possible with the other inmates.\nFrom the few words which he did let drop, however, the landlady gathered\nthat he was a stranger without a single friend in the country to inquire\nafter him should misfortune overtake him.\n\nThe house had an evil reputation for the hocussing of sailors, which\nwas done not only for the purpose of plundering them, but also to supply\noutgoing ships with crews, the men being carried on board insensible,\nand not coming to until the ship was well down the St. Lawrence. This\ntrade caused the wretches who followed it to be experts in the use of\nstupefying drugs, and they determined to practise their arts upon\ntheir friendless lodger, so as to have an opportunity of ransacking his\neffects, and of seeing what it might be worth their while to purloin.\nDuring the day he invariably locked his door and carried off the key in\nhis pocket, but if they could render him insensible for the night they\ncould examine his boxes at their leisure, and deny afterwards that he\nhad ever brought with him the articles which he missed. It happened,\ntherefore, upon the eve of Huxford’s departure from Quebec, that he\nfound, upon returning to his lodgings, that his landlady and her two\nill-favoured sons, who assisted her in her trade, were waiting up for\nhim over a bowl of punch, which they cordially invited him to share.\nIt was a bitterly cold night, and the fragrant steam overpowered any\nsuspicions which the young Englishman may have entertained, so he\ndrained off a bumper, and then, retiring to his bedroom, threw himself\nupon his bed without undressing, and fell straight into a dreamless\nslumber, in which he still lay when the three conspirators crept into\nhis chamber, and, having opened his boxes, began to investigate his\neffects.\n\nIt may have been that the speedy action of the drug caused its effect to\nbe evanescent, or, perhaps, that the strong constitution of the victim\nthrew it off with unusual rapidity. Whatever the cause, it is certain\nthat John Huxford suddenly came to himself, and found the foul trio\nsquatted round their booty, which they were dividing into the two\ncategories of what was of value and should be taken, and what was\nvalueless and might therefore be left. With a bound he sprang out of\nbed, and seizing the fellow nearest him by the collar, he slung him\nthrough the open doorway. His brother rushed at him, but the young\nDevonshire man met him with such a facer that he dropped in a heap\nupon the ground. Unfortunately, the violence of the blow caused him to\noverbalance himself, and, tripping over his prostrate antagonist, he\ncame down heavily upon his face. Before he could rise, the old hag\nsprang upon his back and clung to him, shrieking to her son to bring the\npoker. John managed to shake himself clear of them both, but before he\ncould stand on his guard he was felled from behind by a crashing blow\nfrom an iron bar, which stretched him senseless upon the floor.\n\n“You’ve hit too hard, Joe,” said the old woman, looking down at the\nprostrate figure. “I heard the bone go.”\n\n“If I hadn’t fetched him down he’d ha’ been too many for us,” said the\nyoung villain sulkily.\n\n“Still, you might ha’ done it without killing him, clumsy,” said his\nmother. She had had a large experience of such scenes, and knew the\ndifference between a stunning blow and a fatal one.\n\n“He’s still breathing,” the other said, examining him; “the back o’ his\nhead’s like a bag o’ dice though. The skull’s all splintered. He can’t\nlast. What are we to do?”\n\n“He’ll never come to himself again,” the other brother remarked. “Sarve\nhim right. Look at my face! Let’s see, mother; who’s in the house?”\n\n“Only four drunk sailors.”\n\n“They wouldn’t turn out for any noise. It’s all quiet in the street.\nLet’s carry him down a bit, Joe, and leave him there. He can die there,\nand no one think the worse of us.”\n\n“Take all the papers out of his pocket, then,” the mother suggested;\n“they might help the police to trace him. His watch, too, and his\nmoney--L3 odd; better than nothing. Now carry him softly and don’t\nslip.”\n\nKicking off their shoes, the two brothers carried the dying man down\nstairs and along the deserted street for a couple of hundred yards.\nThere they laid him among the snow, where he was found by the night\npatrol, who carried him on a shutter to the hospital. He was duly\nexamined by the resident surgeon, who bound up the wounded head, but\ngave it as his opinion that the man could not possibly live for more\nthan twelve hours.\n\nTwelve hours passed, however, and yet another twelve, but John Huxford\nstill struggled hard for his life. When at the end of three days he was\nfound to be still breathing, the interest of the doctors became aroused\nat his extraordinary vitality, and they bled him, as the fashion was in\nthose days, and surrounded his shattered head with icebags. It may have\nbeen on account of these measures, or it may have been in spite of\nthem, but at the end of a week’s deep trance the nurse in charge was\nastonished to hear a gabbling noise, and to find the stranger sitting up\nupon the couch and staring about him with wistful, wondering eyes.\nThe surgeons were summoned to behold the phenomenon, and warmly\ncongratulated each other upon the success of their treatment.\n\n“You have been on the brink of the grave, my man,” said one of them,\npressing the bandaged head back on to the pillow; “you must not excite\nyourself. What is your name?”\n\nNo answer, save a wild stare.\n\n“Where do you come from?”\n\nAgain no answer.\n\n“He is mad,” one suggested. “Or a foreigner,” said another. “There were\nno papers on him when he came in. His linen is marked ‘J. H.’ Let us try\nhim in French and German.”\n\nThey tested him with as many tongues as they could muster among them,\nbut were compelled at last to give the matter over and to leave their\nsilent patient, still staring up wild-eyed at the whitewashed hospital\nceiling.\n\nFor many weeks John lay in the hospital, and for many weeks efforts were\nmade to gain some clue as to his antecedents, but in vain. He showed,\nas the time rolled by, not only by his demeanour, but also by the\nintelligence with which he began to pick up fragments of sentences, like\na clever child learning to talk, that his mind was strong enough in the\npresent, though it was a complete blank as to the past. The man’s memory\nof his whole life before the fatal blow was entirely and absolutely\nerased. He neither knew his name, his language, his home, his business,\nnor anything else. The doctors held learned consultations upon him,\nand discoursed upon the centre of memory and depressed tables, deranged\nnerve-cells and cerebral congestions, but all their polysyllables began\nand ended at the fact that the man’s memory was gone, and that it was\nbeyond the power of science to restore it. During the weary months of\nhis convalescence he picked up reading and writing, but with the return\nof his strength came no return of his former life. England, Devonshire,\nBrisport, Mary, Granny--the words brought no recollection to his mind.\nAll was absolute darkness. At last he was discharged, a friendless,\ntradeless, penniless man, without a past, and with very little to look\nto in the future. His very name was altered, for it had been necessary\nto invent one. John Huxford had passed away, and John Hardy took his\nplace among mankind. Here was a strange outcome of a Spanish gentleman’s\ntobacco-inspired meditations.\n\nJohn’s case had aroused some discussion and curiosity in Quebec, so that\nhe was not suffered to drift into utter helplessness upon emerging from\nthe hospital. A Scotch manufacturer named M’Kinlay found him a post\nas porter in his establishment, and for a long time he worked at seven\ndollars a week at the loading and unloading of vans. In the course of\nyears it was noticed, however, that his memory, however defective as\nto the past, was extremely reliable and accurate when concerned with\nanything which had occurred since his accident. From the factory he was\npromoted into the counting-house, and the year 1835 found him a junior\nclerk at a salary of L120 a year. Steadily and surely John Hardy fought\nhis way upward from post to post, with his whole heart and mind devoted\nto the business. In 1840 he was third clerk, in 1845 he was second, and\nin 1852 he became manager of the whole vast establishment, and second\nonly to Mr. M’Kinlay himself.\n\nThere were few who grudged John this rapid advancement, for it was\nobviously due to neither chance nor favouritism, but entirely to his\nmarvellous powers of application and industry. From early morning until\nlate in the night he laboured hard in the service of his employer,\nchecking, overlooking, superintending, setting an example to all of\ncheerful devotion to duty. As he rose from one post to another his\nsalary increased, but it caused no alteration in his mode of living,\nsave that it enabled him to be more open-handed to the poor. He\nsignalised his promotion to the managership by a donation of L1000 to\nthe hospital in which he had been treated a quarter of a century before.\nThe remainder of his earnings he allowed to accumulate in the business,\ndrawing a small sum quarterly for his sustenance, and still residing\nin the humble dwelling which he had occupied when he was a warehouse\nporter. In spite of his success he was a sad, silent, morose man,\nsolitary in his habits, and possessed always of a vague undefined\nyearning, a dull feeling of dissatisfaction and of craving which never\nabandoned him. Often he would strive with his poor crippled brain to\npierce the curtain which divided him from the past, and to solve the\nenigma of his youthful existence, but though he sat many a time by the\nfire until his head throbbed with his efforts, John Hardy could never\nrecall the least glimpse of John Huxford’s history.\n\nOn one occasion he had, in the interests of the firm, to journey to\nQuebec, and to visit the very cork factory which had tempted him to\nleave England. Strolling through the workroom with the foreman, John\nautomatically, and without knowing what he was doing, picked up a square\npiece of the bark, and fashioned it with two or three deft cuts of his\npenknife into a smooth tapering cork. His companion picked it out of his\nhand and examined it with the eye of an expert. “This is not the first\ncork which you have cut by many a hundred, Mr. Hardy,” he remarked.\n“Indeed you are wrong,” John answered, smiling; “I never cut one before\nin my life.” “Impossible!” cried the foreman. “Here’s another bit of\ncork. Try again.” John did his best to repeat the performance, but\nthe brains of the manager interfered with the trained muscles of the\ncorkcutter. The latter had not forgotten their cunning, but they needed\nto be left to themselves, and not directed by a mind which knew nothing\nof the matter. Instead of the smooth graceful shape, he could produce\nnothing but rough-hewn clumsy cylinders. “It must have been chance,”\n said the foreman, “but I could have sworn that it was the work of an old\nhand!”\n\nAs the years passed John’s smooth English skin had warped and crinkled\nuntil he was as brown and as seamed as a walnut. His hair, too, after\nmany years of iron-grey, had finally become as white as the winters of\nhis adopted country. Yet he was a hale and upright old man, and when he\nat last retired from the manager-ship of the firm with which he had been\nso long connected, he bore the weight of his seventy years lightly and\nbravely. He was in the peculiar position himself of not knowing his own\nage, as it was impossible for him to do more than guess at how old he\nwas at the time of his accident.\n\nThe Franco-German War came round, and while the two great rivals were\ndestroying each other, their more peaceful neighbours were quietly\nousting them out of their markets and their commerce. Many English ports\nbenefited by this condition of things, but none more than Brisport.\nIt had long ceased to be a fishing village, but was now a large and\nprosperous town, with a great breakwater in place of the quay on which\nMary had stood, and a frontage of terraces and grand hotels where\nall the grandees of the west country came when they were in need of\na change. All these extensions had made Brisport the centre of a busy\ntrade, and her ships found their way into every harbour in the world.\nHence it was no wonder, especially in that very busy year of 1870,\nthat several Brisport vessels were lying in the river and alongside the\nwharves of Quebec.\n\nOne day John Hardy, who found time hang a little on his hands since his\nretirement from business, strolled along by the water’s edge listening\nto the clanking of the steam winches, and watching the great barrels\nand cases as they were swung ashore and piled upon the wharf. He had\nobserved the coming in of a great ocean steamer, and having waited until\nshe was safely moored, he was turning away, when a few words fell upon\nhis ear uttered by some one on board a little weather-beaten barque\nclose by him. It was only some commonplace order that was bawled out,\nbut the sound fell upon the old man’s ears with a strange mixture of\ndisuse and familiarity. He stood by the vessel and heard the seamen at\ntheir work, all speaking with the same broad, pleasant jingling accent.\nWhy did it send such a thrill through his nerves to listen to it? He sat\ndown upon a coil of rope and pressed his hands to his temples, drinking\nin the long-forgotten dialect, and trying to piece together in his mind\nthe thousand half-formed nebulous recollections which were surging up in\nit. Then he rose, and walking along to the stern he read the name of\nthe ship, The Sunlight, Brisport. Brisport! Again that flush and tingle\nthrough every nerve. Why was that word and the men’s speech so familiar\nto him? He walked moodily home, and all night he lay tossing and\nsleepless, pursuing a shadowy something which was ever within his reach,\nand yet which ever evaded him.\n\nEarly next morning he was up and down on the wharf listening to the\ntalk of the west-country sailors. Every word they spoke seemed to him to\nrevive his memory and bring him nearer to the light. From time to time\nthey paused in their work, and seeing the white-haired stranger sitting\nso silently and attentively, they laughed at him and broke little jests\nupon him. And even these jests had a familiar sound to the exile, as\nthey very well might, seeing that they were the same which he had heard\nin his youth, for no one ever makes a new joke in England. So he sat\nthrough the long day, bathing himself in the west-country speech, and\nwaiting for the light to break.\n\nAnd it happened that when the sailors broke off for their mid-day meal,\none of them, either out of curiosity or good nature, came over to the\nold watcher and greeted him. So John asked him to be seated on a log by\nhis side, and began to put many questions to him about the country from\nwhich he came, and the town. All which the man answered glibly enough,\nfor there is nothing in the world that a sailor loves to talk of so much\nas of his native place, for it pleases him to show that he is no mere\nwanderer, but that he has a home to receive him whenever he shall choose\nto settle down to a quiet life. So the seaman prattled away about the\nTown Hall and the Martello Tower, and the Esplanade, and Pitt Street and\nthe High Street, until his companion suddenly shot out a long eager arm\nand caught him by the wrist. “Look here, man,” he said, in a low quick\nwhisper. “Answer me truly as you hope for mercy. Are not the streets\nthat run out of the High Street, Fox Street, Caroline Street, and George\nStreet, in the order named?” “They are,” the sailor answered, shrinking\naway from the wild flashing eyes. And at that moment John’s memory came\nback to him, and he saw clear and distinct his life as it had been and\nas it should have been, with every minutest detail traced as in letters\nof fire. Too stricken to cry out, too stricken to weep, he could only\nhurry away homewards wildly and aimlessly; hurry as fast as his aged\nlimbs would carry him, as if, poor soul! there were some chance yet of\ncatching up the fifty years which had gone by. Staggering and tremulous\nhe hastened on until a film seemed to gather over his eyes, and throwing\nhis arms into the air with a great cry, “Oh, Mary, Mary! Oh, my lost,\nlost life!” he fell senseless upon the pavement.\n\nThe storm of emotion which had passed through him, and the mental shock\nwhich he had undergone, would have sent many a man into a raging fever,\nbut John was too strong-willed and too practical to allow his strength\nto be wasted at the very time when he needed it most. Within a few days\nhe realised a portion of his property, and starting for New York, caught\nthe first mail steamer to England. Day and night, night and day, he\ntrod the quarter-deck, until the hardy sailors watched the old man with\nastonishment, and marvelled how any human being could do so much upon\nso little sleep. It was only by this unceasing exercise, by wearing\ndown his vitality until fatigue brought lethargy, that he could prevent\nhimself from falling into a very frenzy of despair. He hardly dared ask\nhimself what was the object of this wild journey? What did he expect?\nWould Mary be still alive? She must be a very old woman. If he could but\nsee her and mingle his tears with hers he would be content. Let her\nonly know that it had been no fault of his, and that they had both been\nvictims to the same cruel fate. The cottage was her own, and she had\nsaid that she would wait for him there until she heard from him. Poor\nlass, she had never reckoned on such a wait as this.\n\nAt last the Irish lights were sighted and passed, Land’s End lay like\na blue fog upon the water, and the great steamer ploughed its way along\nthe bold Cornish coast until it dropped its anchor in Plymouth Bay. John\nhurried to the railway station, and within a few hours he found\nhimself back once more in his native town, which he had quitted a poor\ncorkcutter, half a century before.\n\nBut was it the same town? Were it not for the name engraved all over\nthe station and on the hotels, John might have found a difficulty in\nbelieving it. The broad, well-paved streets, with the tram lines laid\ndown the centre, were very different from the narrow winding lanes which\nhe could remember. The spot upon which the station had been built was\nnow the very centre of the town, but in the old days it would have been\nfar out in the fields. In every direction, lines of luxurious villas\nbranched away in streets and crescents bearing names which were new\nto the exile. Great warehouses, and long rows of shops with glittering\nfronts, showed him how enormously Brisport had increased in wealth as\nwell as in dimensions. It was only when he came upon the old High Street\nthat John began to feel at home. It was much altered, but still it was\nrecognisable, and some few of the buildings were just as he had left\nthem. There was the place where Fairbairn’s cork works had been. It was\nnow occupied by a great brand-new hotel. And there was the old grey Town\nHall. The wanderer turned down beside it, and made his way with eager\nsteps but a sinking heart in the direction of the line of cottages which\nhe used to know so well.\n\nIt was not difficult for him to find where they had been. The sea at\nleast was as of old, and from it he could tell where the cottages\nhad stood. But alas, where were they now! In their place an imposing\ncrescent of high stone houses reared their tall front to the beach. John\nwalked wearily down past their palatial entrances, feeling heart-sore\nand despairing, when suddenly a thrill shot through him, followed by a\nwarm glow of excitement and of hope, for, standing a little back from\nthe line, and looking as much out of place as a bumpkin in a ballroom,\nwas an old whitewashed cottage, with wooden porch and walls bright with\ncreeping plants. He rubbed his eyes and stared again, but there it stood\nwith its diamond-paned windows and white muslin curtains, the very same\ndown to the smallest details, as it had been on the day when he last saw\nit. Brown hair had become white, and fishing hamlets had changed into\ncities, but busy hands and a faithful heart had kept granny’s cottage\nunchanged and ready for the wanderer.\n\nAnd now, when he had reached his very haven of rest, John Huxford’s\nmind became more filled with apprehension than ever, and he came over so\ndeadly sick, that he had to sit down upon one of the beach benches\nwhich faced the cottage. An old fisherman was perched at one end of it,\nsmoking his black clay pipe, and he remarked upon the wan face and sad\neyes of the stranger.\n\n“You have overtired yourself,” he said. “It doesn’t do for old chaps\nlike you and me to forget our years.”\n\n“I’m better now, thank you,” John answered. “Can you tell me, friend,\nhow that one cottage came among all those fine houses?”\n\n“Why,” said the old fellow, thumping his crutch energetically upon\nthe ground, “that cottage belongs to the most obstinate woman in all\nEngland. That woman, if you’ll believe me, has been offered the price\nof the cottage ten times over, and yet she won’t part with it. They have\neven promised to remove it stone by stone, and put it up on some more\nconvenient place, and pay her a good round sum into the bargain, but,\nGod bless you! she wouldn’t so much as hear of it.”\n\n“And why was that?” asked John.\n\n“Well, that’s just the funny part of it. It’s all on account of a\nmistake. You see her spark went away when I was a youngster, and she’s\ngot it into her head that he may come back some day, and that he won’t\nknow where to go unless the cottage is there. Why, if the fellow were\nalive he would be as old as you, but I’ve no doubt he’s dead long ago.\nShe’s well quit of him, for he must have been a scamp to abandon her as\nhe did.”\n\n“Oh, he abandoned her, did he?”\n\n“Yes--went off to the States, and never so much as sent a word to\nbid her good-bye. It was a cruel shame, it was, for the girl has been\na-waiting and a-pining for him ever since. It’s my belief that it’s\nfifty years’ weeping that blinded her.”\n\n“She is blind!” cried John, half rising to his feet.\n\n“Worse than that,” said the fisherman. “She’s mortal ill, and not\nexpected to live. Why, look ye, there’s the doctor’s carriage a-waiting\nat her door.”\n\nAt this evil tidings old John sprang up and hurried over to the cottage,\nwhere he met the physician returning to his brougham.\n\n“How is your patient, doctor?” he asked in a trembling voice.\n\n“Very bad, very bad,” said the man of medicine pompously. “If she\ncontinues to sink she will be in great danger; but if, on the other\nhand, she takes a turn, it is possible that she may recover,” with which\noracular answer he drove away in a cloud of dust.\n\nJohn Huxford was still hesitating at the doorway, not knowing how to\nannounce himself, or how far a shock might be dangerous to the sufferer,\nwhen a gentleman in black came bustling up.\n\n“Can you tell me, my man, if this is where the sick woman is?” he asked.\n\nJohn nodded, and the clergyman passed in, leaving the door half open.\nThe wanderer waited until he had gone into the inner room, and then\nslipped into the front parlour, where he had spent so many happy hours.\nAll was the same as ever, down to the smallest ornaments, for Mary had\nbeen in the habit whenever anything was broken of replacing it with\na duplicate, so that there might be no change in the room. He stood\nirresolute, looking about him, until he heard a woman’s voice from the\ninner chamber, and stealing to the door he peeped in.\n\nThe invalid was reclining upon a couch, propped up with pillows, and her\nface was turned full towards John as he looked round the door. He could\nhave cried out as his eyes rested upon it, for there were Mary’s pale,\nplain, sweet homely features as smooth and as unchanged as though she\nwere still the half child, half woman, whom he had pressed to his heart\non the Brisport quay. Her calm, eventless, unselfish life had left none\nof those rude traces upon her countenance which are the outward emblems\nof internal conflict and an unquiet soul. A chaste melancholy had\nrefined and softened her expression, and her loss of sight had been\ncompensated for by that placidity which comes upon the faces of the\nblind. With her silvery hair peeping out beneath her snow-white cap, and\na bright smile upon her sympathetic face, she was the old Mary improved\nand developed, with something ethereal and angelic superadded.\n\n“You will keep a tenant in the cottage,” she was saying to the\nclergyman, who sat with his back turned to the observer. “Choose some\npoor deserving folk in the parish who will be glad of a home free. And\nwhen he comes you will tell him that I have waited for him until I have\nbeen forced to go on, but that he will find me on the other side still\nfaithful and true. There’s a little money too--only a few pounds--but I\nshould like him to have it when he comes, for he may need it, and then\nyou will tell the folk you put in to be kind to him, for he will be\ngrieved, poor lad, and to tell him that I was cheerful and happy up to\nthe end. Don’t let him know that I ever fretted, or he may fret too.”\n\nNow John listened quietly to all this from behind the door, and more\nthan once he had to put his hand to his throat, but when she had\nfinished, and when he thought of her long, blameless, innocent life, and\nsaw the dear face looking straight at him, and yet unable to see him, it\nbecame too much for his manhood, and he burst out into an irrepressible\nchoking sob which shook his very frame. And then occurred a strange\nthing, for though he had spoken no word, the old woman stretched out her\narms to him, and cried, “Oh, Johnny, Johnny! Oh dear, dear Johnny,\nyou have come back to me again,” and before the parson could at all\nunderstand what had happened, those two faithful lovers were in each\nother’s arms, weeping over each other, and patting each other’s silvery\nheads, with their hearts so full of joy that it almost compensated for\nall that weary fifty years of waiting.\n\nIt is hard to say how long they rejoiced together. It seemed a very\nshort time to them and a very long one to the reverend gentleman,\nwho was thinking at last of stealing away, when Mary recollected his\npresence and the courtesy which was due to him. “My heart is full of\njoy, sir,” she said; “it is God’s will that I should not see my Johnny,\nbut I can call his image up as clear as if I had my eyes. Now stand up,\nJohn, and I will let the gentleman see how well I remember you. He is as\ntall, sir, as the second shelf, as straight as an arrow, his face brown,\nand his eyes bright and clear. His hair is well-nigh black, and his\nmoustache the same--I shouldn’t wonder if he had whiskers as well by\nthis time. Now, sir, don’t you think I can do without my sight?” The\nclergyman listened to her description, and looking at the battered,\nwhite-haired man before him, he hardly knew whether to laugh or to cry.\n\nBut it all proved to be a laughing matter in the end, for, whether it\nwas that her illness had taken some natural turn, or that John’s return\nhad startled it away, it is certain that from that day Mary steadily\nimproved until she was as well as ever. “No special license for me,”\n John had said sturdily. “It looks as if we were ashamed of what we are\ndoing, as though we hadn’t the best right to be married of any two folk\nin the parish.” So the banns were put up accordingly, and three times\nit was announced that John Huxford, bachelor, was going to be united\nto Mary Howden, spinster, after which, no one objecting, they were duly\nmarried accordingly. “We may not have very long in this world,” said old\nJohn, “but at least we shall start fair and square in the next.”\n\nJohn’s share in the Quebec business was sold out, and gave rise to a\nvery interesting legal question as to whether, knowing that his name\nwas Huxford, he could still sign that of Hardy, as was necessary for\nthe completion of the business. It was decided, however, that on his\nproducing two trustworthy witnesses to his identity all would be right,\nso the property was duly realised and produced a very handsome fortune.\nPart of this John devoted to building a pretty villa just outside\nBrisport, and the heart of the proprietor of Beach Terrace leaped within\nhim when he learned that the cottage was at last to be abandoned, and\nthat it would no longer break the symmetry and impair the effect of his\nrow of aristocratic mansions.\n\nAnd there in their snug new home, sitting out on the lawn in the\nsummer-time, and on either side of the fire in the winter, that worthy\nold couple continued for many years to live as innocently and as happily\nas two children. Those who knew them well say that there was never a\nshadow between them, and that the love which burned in their aged hearts\nwas as high and as holy as that of any young couple who ever went to the\naltar. And through all the country round, if ever man or woman were in\ndistress and fighting against hard times, they had only to go up to the\nvilla to receive help, and that sympathy which is more precious than\nhelp. So when at last John and Mary fell asleep in their ripe old age,\nwithin a few hours of each other, they had all the poor and the needy\nand the friendless of the parish among their mourners, and in talking\nover the troubles which these two had faced so bravely, they learned\nthat their own miseries also were but passing things, and that faith and\ntruth can never miscarry, either in this existence or the next.\n\n\n\n\nCYPRIAN OVERBECK WELLS--A LITERARY MOSAIC.\n\nFrom my boyhood I have had an intense and overwhelming conviction that\nmy real vocation lay in the direction of literature. I have, however,\nhad a most unaccountable difficulty in getting any responsible person\nto share my views. It is true that private friends have sometimes, after\nlistening to my effusions, gone the length of remarking, “Really, Smith,\nthat’s not half bad!” or, “You take my advice, old boy, and send that\nto some magazine!” but I have never on these occasions had the moral\ncourage to inform my adviser that the article in question had been sent\nto well-nigh every publisher in London, and had come back again with a\nrapidity and precision which spoke well for the efficiency of our postal\narrangements.\n\nHad my manuscripts been paper boomerangs they could not have returned\nwith greater accuracy to their unhappy dispatcher. Oh, the vileness\nand utter degradation of the moment when the stale little cylinder of\nclosely written pages, which seemed so fresh and full of promise a\nfew days ago, is handed in by a remorseless postman! And what moral\ndepravity shines through the editor’s ridiculous plea of “want of\nspace!” But the subject is a painful one, and a digression from the\nplain statement of facts which I originally contemplated.\n\nFrom the age of seventeen to that of three-and-twenty I was a literary\nvolcano in a constant state of eruption. Poems and tales, articles and\nreviews, nothing came amiss to my pen. From the great sea-serpent to the\nnebular hypothesis, I was ready to write on anything or everything, and\nI can safely say that I seldom handled a subject without throwing new\nlights upon it. Poetry and romance, however, had always the greatest\nattractions for me. How I have wept over the pathos of my heroines, and\nlaughed at the comicalities of my buffoons! Alas! I could find no one\nto join me in my appreciation, and solitary admiration for one’s self,\nhowever genuine, becomes satiating after a time. My father remonstrated\nwith me too on the score of expense and loss of time, so that I was\nfinally compelled to relinquish my dreams of literary independence and\nto become a clerk in a wholesale mercantile firm connected with the West\nAfrican trade.\n\nEven when condemned to the prosaic duties which fell to my lot in the\noffice, I continued faithful to my first love. I have introduced pieces\nof word-painting into the most commonplace business letters which have,\nI am told, considerably astonished the recipients. My refined sarcasm\nhas made defaulting creditors writhe and wince. Occasionally, like the\ngreat Silas Wegg, I would drop into poetry, and so raise the whole tone\nof the correspondence. Thus what could be more elegant than my rendering\nof the firm’s instructions to the captain of one of their vessels. It\nran in this way:--\n\n            “From England, Captain, you must steer a\n            Course directly to Madeira,\n            Land the casks of salted beef,\n            Then away to Teneriffe.\n            Pray be careful, cool, and wary\n            With the merchants of Canary.\n            When you leave them make the most\n            Of the trade winds to the coast.\n            Down it you shall sail as far\n            As the land of Calabar,\n            And from there you’ll onward go\n            To Bonny and Fernando Po”----\n\n\nand so on for four pages. The captain, instead of treasuring up this\nlittle gem, called at the office next day, and demanded with quite\nunnecessary warmth what the thing meant, and I was compelled to\ntranslate it all back into prose. On this, as on other similar\noccasions, my employer took me severely to task--for he was, you see, a\nman entirely devoid of all pretensions to literary taste!\n\nAll this, however, is a mere preamble, and leads up to the fact that\nafter ten years or so of drudgery I inherited a legacy which, though\nsmall, was sufficient to satisfy my simple wants. Finding myself\nindependent, I rented a quiet house removed from the uproar and bustle\nof London, and there I settled down with the intention of producing some\ngreat work which should single me out from the family of the Smiths,\nand render my name immortal. To this end I laid in several quires of\nfoolscap, a box of quill pens, and a sixpenny bottle of ink, and having\ngiven my housekeeper injunctions to deny me to all visitors, I proceeded\nto look round for a suitable subject.\n\nI was looking round for some weeks. At the end of that time I found that\nI had by constant nibbling devoured a large number of the quills, and\nhad spread the ink out to such advantage, what with blots, spills, and\nabortive commencements, that there appeared to be some everywhere except\nin the bottle. As to the story itself, however, the facility of my youth\nhad deserted me completely, and my mind remained a complete blank; nor\ncould I, do what I would, excite my sterile imagination to conjure up a\nsingle incident or character.\n\nIn this strait I determined to devote my leisure to running rapidly\nthrough the works of the leading English novelists, from Daniel Defoe\nto the present day, in the hope of stimulating my latent ideas and of\ngetting a good grasp of the general tendency of literature. For some\ntime past I had avoided opening any work of fiction because one of the\ngreatest faults of my youth had been that I invariably and unconsciously\nmimicked the style of the last author whom I had happened to read.\nNow, however, I made up my mind to seek safety in a multitude, and by\nconsulting ALL the English classics to avoid?? the danger of imitating\nany one too closely. I had just accomplished the task of reading through\nthe majority of the standard novels at the time when my narrative\ncommences.\n\nIt was, then, about twenty minutes to ten on the night of the fourth of\nJune, eighteen hundred and eighty-six, that, after disposing of a\npint of beer and a Welsh rarebit for my supper, I seated myself in\nmy arm-chair, cocked my feet upon a stool, and lit my pipe, as was my\ncustom. Both my pulse and my temperature were, as far as I know, normal\nat the time. I would give the state of the barometer, but that\nunlucky instrument had experienced an unprecedented fall of forty-two\ninches--from a nail to the ground--and was not in a reliable condition.\nWe live in a scientific age, and I flatter myself that I move with the\ntimes.\n\nWhilst in that comfortable lethargic condition which accompanies both\ndigestion and poisoning by nicotine, I suddenly became aware of the\nextraordinary fact that my little drawing-room had elongated into a\ngreat salon, and that my humble table had increased in proportion. Round\nthis colossal mahogany were seated a great number of people who were\ntalking earnestly together, and the surface in front of them was strewn\nwith books and pamphlets. I could not help observing that these persons\nwere dressed in a most extraordinary mixture of costumes, for those at\nthe end nearest to me wore peruke wigs, swords, and all the fashions of\ntwo centuries back; those about the centre had tight knee-breeches, high\ncravats, and heavy bunches of seals; while among those at the far side\nthe majority were dressed in the most modern style, and among them\nI saw, to my surprise, several eminent men of letters whom I had the\nhonour of knowing. There were two or three women in the company. I\nshould have risen to my feet to greet these unexpected guests, but all\npower of motion appeared to have deserted me, and I could only lie still\nand listen to their conversation, which I soon perceived to be all about\nmyself.\n\n“Egad!” exclaimed a rough, weather-beaten man, who was smoking a long\nchurchwarden pipe at my end of the table, “my heart softens for him.\nWhy, gossips, we’ve been in the same straits ourselves. Gadzooks, never\ndid mother feel more concern for her eldest born than I when Rory Random\nwent out to make his own way in the world.”\n\n“Right, Tobias, right!” cried another man, seated at my very elbow.\n\n“By my troth, I lost more flesh over poor Robin on his island, than had\nI the sweating sickness twice told. The tale was well-nigh done when in\nswaggers my Lord of Rochester--a merry gallant, and one whose word in\nmatters literary might make or mar. ‘How now, Defoe,’ quoth he, ‘hast a\ntale on hand?’ ‘Even so, your lordship,’ I returned. ‘A right merry one,\nI trust,’ quoth he. ‘Discourse unto me concerning thy heroine, a comely\nlass, Dan, or I mistake.’ ‘Nay,’ I replied, ‘there is no heroine in the\nmatter.’ ‘Split not your phrases,’ quoth he; ‘thou weighest every word\nlike a scald attorney. Speak to me of thy principal female character,\nbe she heroine or no.’ ‘My lord,’ I answered, ‘there is no female\ncharacter.’ ‘Then out upon thyself and thy book too!’ he cried. ‘Thou\nhadst best burn it!’--and so out in great dudgeon, whilst I fell to\nmourning over my poor romance, which was thus, as it were, sentenced to\ndeath before its birth. Yet there are a thousand now who have read of\nRobin and his man Friday, to one who has heard of my Lord of Rochester.”\n\n“Very true, Defoe,” said a genial-looking man in a red waistcoat, who\nwas sitting at the modern end of the table. “But all this won’t help our\ngood friend Smith in making a start at his story, which, I believe, was\nthe reason why we assembled.”\n\n“The Dickens it is!” stammered a little man beside him, and everybody\nlaughed, especially the genial man, who cried out, “Charley Lamb,\nCharley Lamb, you’ll never alter. You would make a pun if you were\nhanged for it.”\n\n“That would be a case of haltering,” returned the other, on which\neverybody laughed again.\n\nBy this time I had begun to dimly realise in my confused brain the\nenormous honour which had been done me. The greatest masters of fiction\nin every age of English letters had apparently made a rendezvous beneath\nmy roof, in order to assist me in my difficulties. There were many faces\nat the table whom I was unable to identify; but when I looked hard\nat others I often found them to be very familiar to me, whether from\npaintings or from mere description. Thus between the first two speakers,\nwho had betrayed themselves as Defoe and Smollett, there sat a dark,\nsaturnine corpulent old man, with harsh prominent features, who I was\nsure could be none other than the famous author of Gulliver. There were\nseveral others of whom I was not so sure, sitting at the other side of\nthe table, but I conjecture that both Fielding and Richardson were among\nthem, and I could swear to the lantern-jaws and cadaverous visage of\nLawrence Sterne. Higher up I could see among the crowd the high forehead\nof Sir Walter Scott, the masculine features of George Eliott, and the\nflattened nose of Thackeray; while amongst the living I recognised James\nPayn, Walter Besant, the lady known as “Ouida,” Robert Louis Stevenson,\nand several of lesser note. Never before, probably, had such an\nassemblage of choice spirits gathered under one roof.\n\n“Well,” said Sir Walter Scott, speaking with a pronounced accent, “ye\nken the auld proverb, sirs, ‘Ower mony cooks,’ or as the Border minstrel\nsang--\n\n        ‘Black Johnstone wi’ his troopers ten\n            Might mak’ the heart turn cauld,\n        But Johnstone when he’s a’ alane\n            Is waur ten thoosand fauld.’\n\nThe Johnstones were one of the Redesdale families, second cousins of the\nArmstrongs, and connected by marriage to----”\n\n“Perhaps, Sir Walter,” interrupted Thackeray, “you would take the\nresponsibility off our hands by yourself dictating the commencement of a\nstory to this young literary aspirant.”\n\n“Na, na!” cried Sir Walter; “I’ll do my share, but there’s Chairlie over\nthere as full o’ wut as a Radical’s full o’ treason. He’s the laddie to\ngive a cheery opening to it.”\n\nDickens was shaking his head, and apparently about to refuse the honour,\nwhen a voice from among the moderns--I could not see who it was for the\ncrowd--said:\n\n“Suppose we begin at the end of the table and work round, any one\ncontributing a little as the fancy seizes him?”\n\n“Agreed! agreed!” cried the whole company; and every eye was turned\non Defoe, who seemed very uneasy, and filled his pipe from a great\ntobacco-box in front of him.\n\n“Nay, gossips,” he said, “there are others more worthy----” But he\nwas interrupted by loud cries of “No! no!” from the whole table; and\nSmollett shouted out, “Stand to it, Dan--stand to it! You and I and the\nDean here will make three short tacks just to fetch her out of harbour,\nand then she may drift where she pleases.” Thus encouraged, Defoe\ncleared his throat, and began in this way, talking between the puffs of\nhis pipe:--\n\n“My father was a well-to-do yeoman of Cheshire, named Cyprian Overbeck,\nbut, marrying about the year 1617, he assumed the name of his wife’s\nfamily, which was Wells; and thus I, their eldest son, was named Cyprian\nOverbeck Wells. The farm was a very fertile one, and contained some of\nthe best grazing land in those parts, so that my father was enabled to\nlay by money to the extent of a thousand crowns, which he laid out in an\nadventure to the Indies with such surprising success that in less than\nthree years it had increased fourfold. Thus encouraged, he bought a\npart share of the trader, and, fitting her out once more with such\ncommodities as were most in demand (viz., old muskets, hangers and\naxes, besides glasses, needles, and the like), he placed me on board\nas supercargo to look after his interests, and despatched us upon our\nvoyage.\n\n“We had a fair wind as far as Cape de Verde, and there, getting into\nthe north-west trade-winds, made good progress down the African coast.\nBeyond sighting a Barbary rover once, whereat our mariners were in sad\ndistress, counting themselves already as little better than slaves, we\nhad good luck until we had come within a hundred leagues of the Cape\nof Good Hope, when the wind veered round to the southward and blew\nexceeding hard, while the sea rose to such a height that the end of the\nmainyard dipped into the water, and I heard the master say that though\nhe had been at sea for five-and-thirty years he had never seen the like\nof it, and that he had little expectation of riding through it. On this\nI fell to wringing my hands and bewailing myself, until the mast going\nby the board with a crash, I thought that the ship had struck, and\nswooned with terror, falling into the scuppers and lying like one\ndead, which was the saving of me, as will appear in the sequel. For the\nmariners, giving up all hope of saving the ship, and being in momentary\nexpectation that she would founder, pushed off in the long-boat, whereby\nI fear that they met the fate which they hoped to avoid, since I\nhave never from that day heard anything of them. For my own part, on\nrecovering from the swoon into which I had fallen, I found that, by the\nmercy of Providence, the sea had gone down, and that I was alone in the\nvessel. At which last discovery I was so terror-struck that I could but\nstand wringing my hands and bewailing my sad fate, until at last taking\nheart, I fell to comparing my lot with that of my unhappy camerados, on\nwhich I became more cheerful, and descending to the cabin, made a meal\noff such dainties as were in the captain’s locker.”\n\nHaving got so far, Defoe remarked that he thought he had given them\na fair start, and handed over the story to Dean Swift, who, after\npremising that he feared he would find himself as much at sea as Master\nCyprian Overbeck Wells, continued in this way:--\n\n“For two days I drifted about in great distress, fearing that there\nshould be a return of the gale, and keeping an eager look-out for my\nlate companions. Upon the third day, towards evening, I observed to\nmy extreme surprise that the ship was under the influence of a very\npowerful current, which ran to the north-east with such violence that\nshe was carried, now bows on, now stern on, and occasionally drifting\nsideways like a crab, at a rate which I cannot compute at less than\ntwelve or fifteen knots an hour. For several weeks I was borne away in\nthis manner, until one morning, to my inexpressible joy, I sighted an\nisland upon the starboard quarter. The current would, however, have\ncarried me past it had I not made shift, though single-handed, to\nset the flying-jib so as to turn her bows, and then clapping on the\nsprit-sail, studding-sail, and fore-sail, I clewed up the halliards upon\nthe port side, and put the wheel down hard a-starboard, the wind being\nat the time north-east-half-east.”\n\nAt the description of this nautical manoeuvre I observed that Smollett\ngrinned, and a gentleman who was sitting higher up the table in the\nuniform of the Royal Navy, and who I guessed to be Captain Marryat,\nbecame very uneasy and fidgeted in his seat.\n\n“By this means I got clear of the current and was able to steer within\na quarter of a mile of the beach, which indeed I might have approached\nstill nearer by making another tack, but being an excellent swimmer, I\ndeemed it best to leave the vessel, which was almost waterlogged, and to\nmake the best of my way to the shore.\n\n“I had had my doubts hitherto as to whether this new-found country was\ninhabited or no, but as I approached nearer to it, being on the summit\nof a great wave, I perceived a number of figures on the beach,\nengaged apparently in watching me and my vessel. My joy, however, was\nconsiderably lessened when on reaching the land I found that the figures\nconsisted of a vast concourse of animals of various sorts who were\nstanding about in groups, and who hurried down to the water’s edge to\nmeet me. I had scarce put my foot upon the sand before I was surrounded\nby an eager crowd of deer, dogs, wild boars, buffaloes, and other\ncreatures, none of whom showed the least fear either of me or of each\nother, but, on the contrary, were animated by a common feeling of\ncuriosity, as well as, it would appear, by some degree of disgust.”\n\n“A second edition,” whispered Lawrence Sterne to his neighbour;\n“Gulliver served up cold.”\n\n“Did you speak, sir?” asked the Dean very sternly, having evidently\noverheard the remark.\n\n“My words were not addressed to you, sir,” answered Sterne, looking\nrather frightened.\n\n“They were none the less insolent,” roared the Dean. “Your reverence\nwould fain make a Sentimental Journey of the narrative, I doubt not, and\nfind pathos in a dead donkey--though faith, no man can blame thee for\nmourning over thy own kith and kin.”\n\n“Better that than to wallow in all the filth of Yahoo-land,” returned\nSterne warmly, and a quarrel would certainly have ensued but for the\ninterposition of the remainder of the company. As it was, the Dean\nrefused indignantly to have any further hand in the story, and Sterne\nalso stood out of it, remarking with a sneer that he was loth to fit a\ngood blade on to a poor handle. Under these circumstances some further\nunpleasantness might have occurred had not Smollett rapidly taken up the\nnarrative, continuing it in the third person instead of the first:--\n\n“Our hero, being considerably alarmed at this strange reception, lost\nlittle time in plunging into the sea again and regaining his vessel,\nbeing convinced that the worst which might befall him from the elements\nwould be as nothing compared to the dangers of this mysterious island.\nIt was as well that he took this course, for before nightfall his ship\nwas overhauled and he himself picked up by a British man-of-war, the\nLightning, then returning from the West Indies, where it had formed part\nof the fleet under the command of Admiral Benbow. Young Wells, being a\nlikely lad enough, well-spoken and high-spirited, was at once entered on\nthe books as officer’s servant, in which capacity he both gained great\npopularity on account of the freedom of his manners, and found an\nopportunity for indulging in those practical pleasantries for which he\nhad all his life been famous.\n\n“Among the quartermasters of the Lightning there was one named Jedediah\nAnchorstock, whose appearance was so remarkable that it quickly\nattracted the attention of our hero. He was a man of about fifty, dark\nwith exposure to the weather, and so tall that as he came along the\n‘tween decks he had to bend himself nearly double. The most striking\npeculiarity of this individual was, however, that in his boyhood some\nevil-minded person had tattooed eyes all over his countenance with such\nmarvellous skill that it was difficult at a short distance to pick out\nhis real ones among so many counterfeits. On this strange personage\nMaster Cyprian determined to exercise his talents for mischief, the more\nso as he learned that he was extremely superstitious, and also that\nhe had left behind him in Portsmouth a strong-minded spouse of whom he\nstood in mortal terror. With this object he secured one of the sheep\nwhich were kept on board for the officers’ table, and pouring a can of\nrumbo down its throat, reduced it to a state of utter intoxication. He\nthen conveyed it to Anchorstock’s berth, and with the assistance of some\nother imps, as mischievous as himself, dressed it up in a high nightcap\nand gown, and covered it over with the bedclothes.\n\n“When the quartermaster came down from his watch our hero met him at\nthe door of his berth with an agitated face. ‘Mr. Anchorstock,’ said he,\n‘can it be that your wife is on board?’ ‘Wife!’ roared the astonished\nsailor. ‘Ye white-faced swab, what d’ye mean?’ ‘If she’s not here in the\nship it must be her ghost,’ said Cyprian, shaking his head gloomily.\n‘In the ship! How in thunder could she get into the ship? Why, master,\nI believe as how you’re weak in the upper works, d’ye see? to as much\nas think o’ such a thing. My Poll is moored head and starn, behind the\npoint at Portsmouth, more’n two thousand mile away.’ ‘Upon my word,’\nsaid our hero, very earnestly, ‘I saw a female look out of your cabin\nnot five minutes ago.’ ‘Ay, ay, Mr. Anchorstock,’ joined in several\nof the conspirators. ‘We all saw her--a spanking-looking craft with\na dead-light mounted on one side.’ ‘Sure enough,’ said Anchorstock,\nstaggered by this accumulation of evidence, ‘my Polly’s starboard eye\nwas doused for ever by long Sue Williams of the Hard. But if so be as\nshe be there I must see her, be she ghost or quick;’ with which the\nhonest sailor, in much perturbation and trembling in every limb, began\nto shuffle forward into the cabin, holding the light well in front of\nhim. It chanced, however, that the unhappy sheep, which was quietly\nengaged in sleeping off the effects of its unusual potations, was\nawakened by the noise of this approach, and finding herself in such an\nunusual position, sprang out of the bed and rushed furiously for the\ndoor, bleating wildly, and rolling about like a brig in a tornado,\npartly from intoxication and partly from the night-dress which impeded\nher movements. As Anchorstock saw this extraordinary apparition bearing\ndown upon him, he uttered a yell and fell flat upon his face, convinced\nthat he had to do with a supernatural visitor, the more so as the\nconfederates heightened the effect by a chorus of most ghastly groans\nand cries.\n\n“The joke had nearly gone beyond what was originally intended, for\nthe quartermaster lay as one dead, and it was only with the greatest\ndifficulty that he could be brought to his senses. To the end of\nthe voyage he stoutly asserted that he had seen the distant Mrs.\nAnchorstock, remarking with many oaths that though he was too woundily\nscared to take much note of the features, there was no mistaking the\nstrong smell of rum which was characteristic of his better half.\n\n“It chanced shortly after this to be the king’s birthday, an event which\nwas signalised aboard the Lightening by the death of the commander under\nsingular circumstances. This officer, who was a real fair-weather\nJack, hardly knowing the ship’s keel from her ensign, had obtained his\nposition through parliamentary interest, and used it with such tyranny\nand cruelty that he was universally execrated. So unpopular was he that\nwhen a plot was entered into by the whole crew to punish his misdeeds\nwith death, he had not a single friend among six hundred souls to warn\nhim of his danger. It was the custom on board the king’s ships that upon\nhis birthday the entire ship’s company should be drawn up upon deck,\nand that at a signal they should discharge their muskets into the air\nin honour of his Majesty. On this occasion word had been secretly passed\nround for every man to slip a slug into his firelock, instead of the\nblank cartridge provided. On the boatswain blowing his whistle the men\nmustered upon deck and formed line, whilst the captain, standing well in\nfront of them, delivered a few words to them. ‘When I give the word,’ he\nconcluded, ‘you shall discharge your pieces, and by thunder, if any man\nis a second before or a second after his fellows I shall trice him up to\nthe weather rigging!’ With these words he roared ‘Fire!’ on which every\nman levelled his musket straight at his head and pulled the trigger.\nSo accurate was the aim and so short the distance, that more than five\nhundred bullets struck him simultaneously, blowing away his head and a\nlarge portion of his body. There were so many concerned in this matter,\nand it was so hopeless to trace it to any individual, that the officers\nwere unable to punish any one for the affair--the more readily as the\ncaptain’s haughty ways and heartless conduct had made him quite as\nhateful to them as to the men whom they commanded.\n\n“By his pleasantries and the natural charm of his manners our hero so\nfar won the good wishes of the ship’s company that they parted with\ninfinite regret upon their arrival in England. Filial duty, however,\nurged him to return home and report himself to his father, with which\nobject he posted from Portsmouth to London, intending to proceed thence\nto Shropshire. As it chanced, however, one of the horses sprained his\noff foreleg while passing through Chichester, and as no change could\nbe obtained, Cyprian found himself compelled to put up at the Crown and\nBull for the night.\n\n“Ods bodikins!” continued Smollett, laughing, “I never could pass a\ncomfortable hostel without stopping, and so, with your permission, I’ll\ne’en stop here, and whoever wills may lead friend Cyprian to his further\nadventures. Do you, Sir Walter, give us a touch of the Wizard of the\nNorth.”\n\nWith these words Smollett produced a pipe, and filling it at Defoe’s\ntobacco-pot, waited patiently for the continuation of the story.\n\n“If I must, I must,” remarked the illustrious Scotchman, taking a pinch\nof snuff; “but I must beg leave to put Mr. Wells back a few hundred\nyears, for of all things I love the true mediaeval smack. To proceed\nthen:--\n\n“Our hero, being anxious to continue his journey, and learning that it\nwould be some time before any conveyance would be ready, determined\nto push on alone mounted on his gallant grey steed. Travelling was\nparticularly dangerous at that time, for besides the usual perils which\nbeset wayfarers, the southern parts of England were in a lawless and\ndisturbed state which bordered on insurrection. The young man, however,\nhaving loosened his sword in his sheath, so as to be ready for every\neventuality, galloped cheerily upon his way, guiding himself to the best\nof his ability by the light of the rising moon.\n\n“He had not gone far before he realised that the cautions which had been\nimpressed upon him by the landlord, and which he had been inclined to\nlook upon as self-interested advice, were only too well justified. At\na spot where the road was particularly rough, and ran across some marsh\nland, he perceived a short distance from him a dark shadow, which his\npractised eye detected at once as a body of crouching men. Reining up\nhis horse within a few yards of the ambuscade, he wrapped his cloak\nround his bridle-arm and summoned the party to stand forth.\n\n“‘What ho, my masters!’ he cried. ‘Are beds so scarce, then, that ye\nmust hamper the high road of the king with your bodies? Now, by St.\nUrsula of Alpuxerra, there be those who might think that birds who fly\no’ nights were after higher game than the moorhen or the woodcock!’\n\n“‘Blades and targets, comrades!’ exclaimed a tall powerful man,\nspringing into the centre of the road with several companions, and\nstanding in front of the frightened horse. ‘Who is this swashbuckler\nwho summons his Majesty’s lieges from their repose? A very soldado, o’\ntruth. Hark ye, sir, or my lord, or thy grace, or whatsoever title your\nhonour’s honour may be pleased to approve, thou must curb thy tongue\nplay, or by the seven witches of Gambleside thou may find thyself in but\na sorry plight.’\n\n“‘I prythee, then, that thou wilt expound to me who and what ye are,’\nquoth our hero, ‘and whether your purpose be such as an honest man may\napprove of. As to your threats, they turn from my mind as your caitiffly\nweapons would shiver upon my hauberk from Milan.’\n\n“‘Nay, Allen,’ interrupted one of the party, addressing him who seemed\nto be their leader; ‘this is a lad of mettle, and such a one as our\nhonest Jack longs for. But we lure not hawks with empty hands. Look ye,\nsir, there is game afoot which it may need such bold hunters as thyself\nto follow. Come with us and take a firkin of canary, and we will find\nbetter work for that glaive of thine than getting its owner into broil\nand bloodshed; for, by my troth! Milan or no Milan, if my curtel axe\ndo but ring against that morion of thine it will be an ill day for thy\nfather’s son.’\n\n“For a moment our hero hesitated as to whether it would best become his\nknightly traditions to hurl himself against his enemies, or whether it\nmight not be better to obey their requests. Prudence, mingled with a\nlarge share of curiosity, eventually carried the day, and dismounting\nfrom his horse, he intimated that he was ready to follow his captors.\n\n“‘Spoken like a man!’ cried he whom they addressed as Allen. ‘Jack Cade\nwill be right glad of such a recruit. Blood and carrion! but thou hast\nthe thews of a young ox; and I swear, by the haft of my sword, that it\nmight have gone ill with some of us hadst thou not listened to reason!’\n\n“‘Nay, not so, good Allen--not so,’ squeaked a very small man, who had\nremained in the background while there was any prospect of a fray,\nbut who now came pushing to the front. ‘Hadst thou been alone it might\nindeed have been so, perchance, but an expert swordsman can disarm\nat pleasure such a one as this young knight. Well I remember in the\nPalatinate how I clove to the chine even such another--the Baron von\nSlogstaff. He struck at me, look ye, so; but I, with buckler and blade,\ndid, as one might say, deflect it; and then, countering in carte, I\nreturned in tierce, and so--St. Agnes save us! who comes here?’\n\n“The apparition which frightened the loquacious little man was\nsufficiently strange to cause a qualm even in the bosom of the knight.\nThrough the darkness there loomed a figure which appeared to be of\ngigantic size, and a hoarse voice, issuing apparently some distance\nabove the heads of the party, broke roughly on the silence of the night.\n\n“‘Now out upon thee, Thomas Allen, and foul be thy fate if thou hast\nabandoned thy post without good and sufficient cause. By St. Anselm\nof the Holy Grove, thou hadst best have never been born than rouse\nmy spleen this night. Wherefore is it that you and your men are\ntrailing over the moor like a flock of geese when Michaelmas is near?’\n\n“‘Good captain,’ said Allen, doffing his bonnet, an example followed by\nothers of the band, ‘we have captured a goodly youth who was pricking\nit along the London road. Methought that some word of thanks were meet\nreward for such service, rather than taunt or threat.’\n\n“‘Nay, take it not to heart, bold Allen,’ exclaimed their leader, who\nwas none other than the great Jack Cade himself. ‘Thou knowest of old\nthat my temper is somewhat choleric, and my tongue not greased with that\nunguent which oils the mouths of the lip-serving lords of the land. And\nyou,’ he continued, turning suddenly upon our hero, ‘are you ready\nto join the great cause which will make England what it was when the\nlearned Alfred reigned in the land? Zounds, man, speak out, and pick not\nyour phrases.’\n\n“‘I am ready to do aught which may become a knight and a gentleman,’\nsaid the soldier stoutly.\n\n“‘Taxes shall be swept away!’ cried Cade excitedly--‘the impost and\nthe anpost--the tithe and the hundred-tax. The poor man’s salt-box and\nflour-bin shall be as free as the nobleman’s cellar. Ha! what sayest\nthou?’\n\n“‘It is but just,’ said our hero.\n\n“‘Ay, but they give us such justice as the falcon gives the leveret!’\nroared the orator. ‘Down with them, I say--down with every man of them!\nNoble and judge, priest and king, down with them all!’\n\n“‘Nay,’ said Sir Overbeck Wells, drawing himself up to his full height,\nand laying his hand upon the hilt of his sword, ‘there I cannot follow\nthee, but must rather defy thee as traitor and faineant, seeing that\nthou art no true man, but one who would usurp the rights of our master\nthe king, whom may the Virgin protect!’\n\n“At these bold words, and the defiance which they conveyed, the rebels\nseemed for a moment utterly bewildered; but, encouraged by the hoarse\nshout of their leader, they brandished their weapons and prepared to\nfall upon the knight, who placed himself in a posture for defence and\nawaited their attack.\n\n“There now!” cried Sir Walter, rubbing his hands and chuckling, “I’ve\nput the chiel in a pretty warm corner, and we’ll see which of you\nmoderns can take him oot o’t. Ne’er a word more will ye get frae me to\nhelp him one way or the other.”\n\n“You try your hand, James,” cried several voices, and the author in\nquestion had got so far as to make an allusion to a solitary horseman\nwho was approaching, when he was interrupted by a tall gentleman a\nlittle farther down with a slight stutter and a very nervous manner.\n\n“Excuse me,” he said, “but I fancy that I may be able to do something\nhere. Some of my humble productions have been said to excel Sir Walter\nat his best, and I was undoubtedly stronger all round. I could picture\nmodern society as well as ancient; and as to my plays, why Shakespeare\nnever came near ‘The Lady of Lyons’ for popularity. There is this\nlittle thing----” (Here he rummaged among a great pile of papers in\nfront of him). “Ah! that’s a report of mine, when I was in India! Here\nit is. No, this is one of my speeches in the House, and this is my\ncriticism on Tennyson. Didn’t I warm him up? I can’t find what I wanted,\nbut of course you have read them all--‘Rienzi,’ and ‘Harold,’ and\n‘The Last of the Barons.’ Every schoolboy knows them by heart, as poor\nMacaulay would have said. Allow me to give you a sample:--\n\n“In spite of the gallant knight’s valiant resistance the combat was too\nunequal to be sustained. His sword was broken by a slash from a brown\nbill, and he was borne to the ground. He expected immediate death, but\nsuch did not seem to be the intention of the ruffians who had captured\nhim. He was placed upon the back of his own charger and borne, bound\nhand and foot, over the trackless moor, in the fastnesses of which the\nrebels secreted themselves.\n\n“In the depths of these wilds there stood a stone building which had\nonce been a farm-house, but having been for some reason abandoned had\nfallen into ruin, and had now become the headquarters of Cade and\nhis men. A large cowhouse near the farm had been utilised as sleeping\nquarters, and some rough attempts had been made to shield the principal\nroom of the main building from the weather by stopping up the gaping\napertures in the walls. In this apartment was spread out a rough meal\nfor the returning rebels, and our hero was thrown, still bound, into an\nempty outhouse, there to await his fate.”\n\nSir Walter had been listening with the greatest impatience to Bulwer\nLytton’s narrative, but when it had reached this point he broke in\nimpatiently.\n\n“We want a touch of your own style, man,” he said. “The\nanimal-magnetico-electro-hysterical-biological-mysterious sort of story\nis all your own, but at present you are just a poor copy of myself, and\nnothing more.”\n\nThere was a murmur of assent from the company, and Defoe remarked,\n“Truly, Master Lytton, there is a plaguey resemblance in the style,\nwhich may indeed be but a chance, and yet methinks it is sufficiently\nmarked to warrant such words as our friend hath used.”\n\n“Perhaps you will think that this is an imitation also,” said Lytton\nbitterly, and leaning back in his chair with a morose countenance, he\ncontinued the narrative in this way:--\n\n“Our unfortunate hero had hardly stretched himself upon the straw with\nwhich his dungeon was littered, when a secret door opened in the wall\nand a venerable old man swept majestically into the apartment. The\nprisoner gazed upon him with astonishment not unmixed with awe, for on\nhis broad brow was printed the seal of much knowledge--such knowledge as\nit is not granted to the son of man to know. He was clad in a long white\nrobe, crossed and chequered with mystic devices in the Arabic character,\nwhile a high scarlet tiara marked with the square and circle enhanced\nhis venerable appearance. ‘My son,’ he said, turning his piercing and\nyet dreamy gaze upon Sir Overbeck, ‘all things lead to nothing, and\nnothing is the foundation of all things. Cosmos is impenetrable. Why\nthen should we exist?’\n\n“Astounded at this weighty query, and at the philosophic demeanour of\nhis visitor, our hero made shift to bid him welcome and to demand his\nname and quality. As the old man answered him his voice rose and fell in\nmusical cadences, like the sighing of the east wind, while an ethereal\nand aromatic vapour pervaded the apartment.\n\n“‘I am the eternal non-ego,’ he answered. ‘I am the concentrated\nnegative--the everlasting essence of nothing. You see in me that\nwhich existed before the beginning of matter many years before the\ncommencement of time. I am the algebraic _x_ which represents the\ninfinite divisibility of a finite particle.’\n\n“Sir Overbeck felt a shudder as though an ice-cold hand had been placed\nupon his brow. ‘What is your message?’ he whispered, falling prostrate\nbefore his mysterious visitor.\n\n“‘To tell you that the eternities beget chaos, and that the immensities\nare at the mercy of the divine ananke. Infinitude crouches before a\npersonality. The mercurial essence is the prime mover in spirituality,\nand the thinker is powerless before the pulsating inanity. The cosmical\nprocession is terminated only by the unknowable and unpronounceable’----\n\n“May I ask, Mr. Smollett, what you find to laugh at?”\n\n“Gad zooks, master,” cried Smollett, who had been sniggering for some\ntime back. “It seems to me that there is little danger of any one\nventuring to dispute that style with you.”\n\n“It’s all your own,” murmured Sir Walter.\n\n“And very pretty, too,” quoth Lawrence Sterne, with a malignant grin.\n“Pray sir, what language do you call it?”\n\nLytton was so enraged at these remarks, and at the favour with which\nthey appeared to be received, that he endeavoured to stutter out some\nreply, and then, losing control of himself completely, picked up all his\nloose papers and strode out of the room, dropping pamphlets and speeches\nat every step. This incident amused the company so much that they\nlaughed for several minutes without cessation. Gradually the sound of\ntheir laughter sounded more and more harshly in my ears, the lights\non the table grew dim and the company more misty, until they and their\nsymposium vanished away altogether. I was sitting before the embers of\nwhat had been a roaring fire, but was now little more than a heap of\ngrey ashes, and the merry laughter of the august company had changed\nto the recriminations of my wife, who was shaking me violently by the\nshoulder and exhorting me to choose some more seasonable spot for my\nslumbers. So ended the wondrous adventures of Master Cyprian Overbeck\nWells, but I still live in the hopes that in some future dream the great\nmasters may themselves finish that which they have begun.\n\n\n\n\nJOHN BARRINGTON COWLES.\n\nIt might seem rash of me to say that I ascribe the death of my poor\nfriend, John Barrington Cowles, to any preternatural agency. I am aware\nthat in the present state of public feeling a chain of evidence would\nrequire to be strong indeed before the possibility of such a conclusion\ncould be admitted.\n\nI shall therefore merely state the circumstances which led up to this\nsad event as concisely and as plainly as I can, and leave every reader\nto draw his own deductions. Perhaps there may be some one who can throw\nlight upon what is dark to me.\n\nI first met Barrington Cowles when I went up to Edinburgh University to\ntake out medical classes there. My landlady in Northumberland Street\nhad a large house, and, being a widow without children, she gained a\nlivelihood by providing accommodation for several students.\n\nBarrington Cowles happened to have taken a bedroom upon the same floor\nas mine, and when we came to know each other better we shared a small\nsitting-room, in which we took our meals. In this manner we originated\na friendship which was unmarred by the slightest disagreement up to the\nday of his death.\n\nCowles’ father was the colonel of a Sikh regiment and had remained in\nIndia for many years. He allowed his son a handsome income, but seldom\ngave any other sign of parental affection--writing irregularly and\nbriefly.\n\nMy friend, who had himself been born in India, and whose whole\ndisposition was an ardent tropical one, was much hurt by this neglect.\nHis mother was dead, and he had no other relation in the world to supply\nthe blank.\n\nThus he came in time to concentrate all his affection upon me, and to\nconfide in me in a manner which is rare among men. Even when a stronger\nand deeper passion came upon him, it never infringed upon the old\ntenderness between us.\n\nCowles was a tall, slim young fellow, with an olive, Velasquez-like\nface, and dark, tender eyes. I have seldom seen a man who was more\nlikely to excite a woman’s interest, or to captivate her imagination.\nHis expression was, as a rule, dreamy, and even languid; but if in\nconversation a subject arose which interested him he would be all\nanimation in a moment. On such occasions his colour would heighten, his\neyes gleam, and he could speak with an eloquence which would carry his\naudience with him.\n\nIn spite of these natural advantages he led a solitary life, avoiding\nfemale society, and reading with great diligence. He was one of the\nforemost men of his year, taking the senior medal for anatomy, and the\nNeil Arnott prize for physics.\n\nHow well I can recollect the first time we met her! Often and often I\nhave recalled the circumstances, and tried to remember what the exact\nimpression was which she produced on my mind at the time.\n\nAfter we came to know her my judgment was warped, so that I am curious\nto recollect what my unbiassed{sic} instincts were. It is hard, however,\nto eliminate the feelings which reason or prejudice afterwards raised in\nme.\n\nIt was at the opening of the Royal Scottish Academy in the spring of\n1879. My poor friend was passionately attached to art in every form, and\na pleasing chord in music or a delicate effect upon canvas would give\nexquisite pleasure to his highly-strung nature. We had gone together to\nsee the pictures, and were standing in the grand central salon, when I\nnoticed an extremely beautiful woman standing at the other side of the\nroom. In my whole life I have never seen such a classically perfect\ncountenance. It was the real Greek type--the forehead broad, very low,\nand as white as marble, with a cloudlet of delicate locks wreathing\nround it, the nose straight and clean cut, the lips inclined to\nthinness, the chin and lower jaw beautifully rounded off, and yet\nsufficiently developed to promise unusual strength of character.\n\nBut those eyes--those wonderful eyes! If I could but give some faint\nidea of their varying moods, their steely hardness, their feminine\nsoftness, their power of command, their penetrating intensity suddenly\nmelting away into an expression of womanly weakness--but I am speaking\nnow of future impressions!\n\nThere was a tall, yellow-haired young man with this lady, whom I at once\nrecognised as a law student with whom I had a slight acquaintance.\n\nArchibald Reeves--for that was his name--was a dashing, handsome young\nfellow, and had at one time been a ringleader in every university\nescapade; but of late I had seen little of him, and the report was that\nhe was engaged to be married. His companion was, then, I presumed, his\nfiancee. I seated myself upon the velvet settee in the centre of the\nroom, and furtively watched the couple from behind my catalogue.\n\nThe more I looked at her the more her beauty grew upon me. She was\nsomewhat short in stature, it is true; but her figure was perfection,\nand she bore herself in such a fashion that it was only by actual\ncomparison that one would have known her to be under the medium height.\n\nAs I kept my eyes upon them, Reeves was called away for some reason,\nand the young lady was left alone. Turning her back to the pictures, she\npassed the time until the return of her escort in taking a deliberate\nsurvey of the company, without paying the least heed to the fact that\na dozen pair of eyes, attracted by her elegance and beauty, were bent\ncuriously upon her. With one of her hands holding the red silk cord\nwhich railed off the pictures, she stood languidly moving her eyes from\nface to face with as little self-consciousness as if she were looking at\nthe canvas creatures behind her. Suddenly, as I watched her, I saw her\ngaze become fixed, and, as it were, intense. I followed the direction of\nher looks, wondering what could have attracted her so strongly.\n\nJohn Barrington Cowles was standing before a picture--one, I think, by\nNoel Paton--I know that the subject was a noble and ethereal one.\nHis profile was turned towards us, and never have I seen him to such\nadvantage. I have said that he was a strikingly handsome man, but at\nthat moment he looked absolutely magnificent. It was evident that he had\nmomentarily forgotten his surroundings, and that his whole soul was in\nsympathy with the picture before him. His eyes sparkled, and a dusky\npink shone through his clear olive cheeks. She continued to watch him\nfixedly, with a look of interest upon her face, until he came out of his\nreverie with a start, and turned abruptly round, so that his gaze met\nhers. She glanced away at once, but his eyes remained fixed upon her for\nsome moments. The picture was forgotten already, and his soul had come\ndown to earth once more.\n\nWe caught sight of her once or twice before we left, and each time I\nnoticed my friend look after her. He made no remark, however, until we\ngot out into the open air, and were walking arm-in-arm along Princes\nStreet.\n\n“Did you notice that beautiful woman, in the dark dress, with the white\nfur?” he asked.\n\n“Yes, I saw her,” I answered.\n\n“Do you know her?” he asked eagerly. “Have you any idea who she is?”\n\n“I don’t know her personally,” I replied. “But I have no doubt I could\nfind out all about her, for I believe she is engaged to young Archie\nReeves, and he and I have a lot of mutual friends.”\n\n“Engaged!” ejaculated Cowles.\n\n“Why, my dear boy,” I said, laughing, “you don’t mean to say you are so\nsusceptible that the fact that a girl to whom you never spoke in your\nlife is engaged is enough to upset you?”\n\n“Well, not exactly to upset me,” he answered, forcing a laugh. “But I\ndon’t mind telling you, Armitage, that I never was so taken by any\none in my life. It wasn’t the mere beauty of the face--though that was\nperfect enough--but it was the character and the intellect upon it. I\nhope, if she is engaged, that it is to some man who will be worthy of\nher.”\n\n“Why,” I remarked, “you speak quite feelingly. It is a clear case of\nlove at first sight, Jack. However, to put your perturbed spirit at\nrest, I’ll make a point of finding out all about her whenever I meet any\nfellow who is likely to know.”\n\nBarrington Cowles thanked me, and the conversation drifted off into\nother channels. For several days neither of us made any allusion to\nthe subject, though my companion was perhaps a little more dreamy\nand distraught than usual. The incident had almost vanished from my\nremembrance, when one day young Brodie, who is a second cousin of mine,\ncame up to me on the university steps with the face of a bearer of\ntidings.\n\n“I say,” he began, “you know Reeves, don’t you?”\n\n“Yes. What of him?”\n\n“His engagement is off.”\n\n“Off!” I cried. “Why, I only learned the other day that it was on.”\n\n“Oh, yes--it’s all off. His brother told me so. Deucedly mean of Reeves,\nyou know, if he has backed out of it, for she was an uncommonly nice\ngirl.”\n\n“I’ve seen her,” I said; “but I don’t know her name.”\n\n“She is a Miss Northcott, and lives with an old aunt of hers in\nAbercrombie Place. Nobody knows anything about her people, or where she\ncomes from. Anyhow, she is about the most unlucky girl in the world,\npoor soul!”\n\n“Why unlucky?”\n\n“Well, you know, this was her second engagement,” said young Brodie, who\nhad a marvellous knack of knowing everything about everybody. “She was\nengaged to Prescott--William Prescott, who died. That was a very\nsad affair. The wedding day was fixed, and the whole thing looked as\nstraight as a die when the smash came.”\n\n“What smash?” I asked, with some dim recollection of the circumstances.\n\n“Why, Prescott’s death. He came to Abercrombie Place one night, and\nstayed very late. No one knows exactly when he left, but about one\nin the morning a fellow who knew him met him walking rapidly in the\ndirection of the Queen’s Park. He bade him good night, but Prescott\nhurried on without heeding him, and that was the last time he was ever\nseen alive. Three days afterwards his body was found floating in\nSt. Margaret’s Loch, under St. Anthony’s Chapel. No one could ever\nunderstand it, but of course the verdict brought it in as temporary\ninsanity.”\n\n“It was very strange,” I remarked.\n\n“Yes, and deucedly rough on the poor girl,” said Brodie. “Now that this\nother blow has come it will quite crush her. So gentle and ladylike she\nis too!”\n\n“You know her personally, then!” I asked.\n\n“Oh, yes, I know her. I have met her several times. I could easily\nmanage that you should be introduced to her.”\n\n“Well,” I answered, “it’s not so much for my own sake as for a friend of\nmine. However, I don’t suppose she will go out much for some little time\nafter this. When she does I will take advantage of your offer.”\n\nWe shook hands on this, and I thought no more of the matter for some\ntime.\n\nThe next incident which I have to relate as bearing at all upon the\nquestion of Miss Northcott is an unpleasant one. Yet I must detail it as\naccurately as possible, since it may throw some light upon the sequel.\nOne cold night, several months after the conversation with my second\ncousin which I have quoted above, I was walking down one of the\nlowest streets in the city on my way back from a case which I had been\nattending. It was very late, and I was picking my way among the dirty\nloungers who were clustering round the doors of a great gin-palace, when\na man staggered out from among them, and held out his hand to me with a\ndrunken leer. The gaslight fell full upon his face, and, to my intense\nastonishment, I recognised in the degraded creature before me my former\nacquaintance, young Archibald Reeves, who had once been famous as one\nof the most dressy and particular men in the whole college. I was so\nutterly surprised that for a moment I almost doubted the evidence of\nmy own senses; but there was no mistaking those features, which, though\nbloated with drink, still retained something of their former comeliness.\nI was determined to rescue him, for one night at least, from the company\ninto which he had fallen.\n\n“Holloa, Reeves!” I said. “Come along with me. I’m going in your\ndirection.”\n\nHe muttered some incoherent apology for his condition, and took my arm.\nAs I supported him towards his lodgings I could see that he was not only\nsuffering from the effects of a recent debauch, but that a long course\nof intemperance had affected his nerves and his brain. His hand when I\ntouched it was dry and feverish, and he started from every shadow which\nfell upon the pavement. He rambled in his speech, too, in a manner which\nsuggested the delirium of disease rather than the talk of a drunkard.\n\n\nWhen I got him to his lodgings I partially undressed him and laid him\nupon his bed. His pulse at this time was very high, and he was evidently\nextremely feverish. He seemed to have sunk into a doze; and I was about\nto steal out of the room to warn his landlady of his condition, when he\nstarted up and caught me by the sleeve of my coat.\n\n“Don’t go!” he cried. “I feel better when you are here. I am safe from\nher then.”\n\n“From her!” I said. “From whom?”\n\n“Her! her!” he answered peevishly. “Ah! you don’t know her. She is the\ndevil! Beautiful--beautiful; but the devil!”\n\n“You are feverish and excited,” I said. “Try and get a little sleep. You\nwill wake better.”\n\n“Sleep!” he groaned. “How am I to sleep when I see her sitting down\nyonder at the foot of the bed with her great eyes watching and watching\nhour after hour? I tell you it saps all the strength and manhood out of\nme. That’s what makes me drink. God help me--I’m half drunk now!”\n\n“You are very ill,” I said, putting some vinegar to his temples; “and\nyou are delirious. You don’t know what you say.”\n\n“Yes, I do,” he interrupted sharply, looking up at me. “I know very\nwell what I say. I brought it upon myself. It is my own choice. But I\ncouldn’t--no, by heaven, I couldn’t--accept the alternative. I couldn’t\nkeep my faith to her. It was more than man could do.”\n\nI sat by the side of the bed, holding one of his burning hands in mine,\nand wondering over his strange words. He lay still for some time, and\nthen, raising his eyes to me, said in a most plaintive voice--\n\n“Why did she not give me warning sooner? Why did she wait until I had\nlearned to love her so?”\n\nHe repeated this question several times, rolling his feverish head from\nside to side, and then he dropped into a troubled sleep. I crept out of\nthe room, and, having seen that he would be properly cared for, left\nthe house. His words, however, rang in my ears for days afterwards, and\nassumed a deeper significance when taken with what was to come.\n\nMy friend, Barrington Cowles, had been away for his summer holidays, and\nI had heard nothing of him for several months. When the winter session\ncame on, however, I received a telegram from him, asking me to secure\nthe old rooms in Northumberland Street for him, and telling me the train\nby which he would arrive. I went down to meet him, and was delighted to\nfind him looking wonderfully hearty and well.\n\n“By the way,” he said suddenly, that night, as we sat in our chairs\nby the fire, talking over the events of the holidays, “you have never\ncongratulated me yet!”\n\n“On what, my boy?” I asked.\n\n“What! Do you mean to say you have not heard of my engagement?”\n\n“Engagement! No!” I answered. “However, I am delighted to hear it, and\ncongratulate you with all my heart.”\n\n“I wonder it didn’t come to your ears,” he said. “It was the queerest\nthing. You remember that girl whom we both admired so much at the\nAcademy?”\n\n“What!” I cried, with a vague feeling of apprehension at my heart. “You\ndon’t mean to say that you are engaged to her?”\n\n“I thought you would be surprised,” he answered. “When I was staying\nwith an old aunt of mine in Peterhead, in Aberdeenshire, the Northcotts\nhappened to come there on a visit, and as we had mutual friends we soon\nmet. I found out that it was a false alarm about her being engaged, and\nthen--well, you know what it is when you are thrown into the society of\nsuch a girl in a place like Peterhead. Not, mind you,” he added, “that I\nconsider I did a foolish or hasty thing. I have never regretted it for\na moment. The more I know Kate the more I admire her and love her.\nHowever, you must be introduced to her, and then you will form your own\nopinion.”\n\nI expressed my pleasure at the prospect, and endeavoured to speak as\nlightly as I could to Cowles upon the subject, but I felt depressed\nand anxious at heart. The words of Reeves and the unhappy fate of young\nPrescott recurred to my recollection, and though I could assign no\ntangible reason for it, a vague, dim fear and distrust of the woman\ntook possession of me. It may be that this was foolish prejudice and\nsuperstition upon my part, and that I involuntarily contorted her future\ndoings and sayings to fit into some half-formed wild theory of my\nown. This has been suggested to me by others as an explanation of my\nnarrative. They are welcome to their opinion if they can reconcile it\nwith the facts which I have to tell.\n\nI went round with my friend a few days afterwards to call upon Miss\nNorthcott. I remember that, as we went down Abercrombie Place, our\nattention was attracted by the shrill yelping of a dog--which noise\nproved eventually to come from the house to which we were bound. We\nwere shown upstairs, where I was introduced to old Mrs. Merton, Miss\nNorthcott’s aunt, and to the young lady herself. She looked as beautiful\nas ever, and I could not wonder at my friend’s infatuation. Her face\nwas a little more flushed than usual, and she held in her hand a heavy\ndog-whip, with which she had been chastising a small Scotch terrier,\nwhose cries we had heard in the street. The poor brute was cringing up\nagainst the wall, whining piteously, and evidently completely cowed.\n\n“So Kate,” said my friend, after we had taken our seats, “you have been\nfalling out with Carlo again.”\n\n“Only a very little quarrel this time,” she said, smiling charmingly.\n“He is a dear, good old fellow, but he needs correction now and then.”\n Then, turning to me, “We all do that, Mr. Armitage, don’t we? What a\ncapital thing if, instead of receiving a collective punishment at the\nend of our lives, we were to have one at once, as the dogs do, when we\ndid anything wicked. It would make us more careful, wouldn’t it?”\n\nI acknowledged that it would.\n\n“Supposing that every time a man misbehaved himself a gigantic hand\nwere to seize him, and he were lashed with a whip until he fainted”--she\nclenched her white fingers as she spoke, and cut out viciously with\nthe dog-whip--“it would do more to keep him good than any number of\nhigh-minded theories of morality.”\n\n“Why, Kate,” said my friend, “you are quite savage to-day.”\n\n“No, Jack,” she laughed. “I’m only propounding a theory for Mr.\nArmitage’s consideration.”\n\nThe two began to chat together about some Aberdeenshire reminiscence,\nand I had time to observe Mrs. Merton, who had remained silent during\nour short conversation. She was a very strange-looking old lady. What\nattracted attention most in her appearance was the utter want of colour\nwhich she exhibited. Her hair was snow-white, and her face extremely\npale. Her lips were bloodless, and even her eyes were of such a light\ntinge of blue that they hardly relieved the general pallor. Her dress\nwas a grey silk, which harmonised with her general appearance. She had a\npeculiar expression of countenance, which I was unable at the moment to\nrefer to its proper cause.\n\nShe was working at some old-fashioned piece of ornamental needlework,\nand as she moved her arms her dress gave forth a dry, melancholy\nrustling, like the sound of leaves in the autumn. There was something\nmournful and depressing in the sight of her. I moved my chair a little\nnearer, and asked her how she liked Edinburgh, and whether she had been\nthere long.\n\nWhen I spoke to her she started and looked up at me with a scared look\non her face. Then I saw in a moment what the expression was which I had\nobserved there. It was one of fear--intense and overpowering fear. It\nwas so marked that I could have staked my life on the woman before\nme having at some period of her life been subjected to some terrible\nexperience or dreadful misfortune.\n\n“Oh, yes, I like it,” she said, in a soft, timid voice; “and we have\nbeen here long--that is, not very long. We move about a great deal.” She\nspoke with hesitation, as if afraid of committing herself.\n\n“You are a native of Scotland, I presume?” I said.\n\n“No--that is, not entirely. We are not natives of any place. We are\ncosmopolitan, you know.” She glanced round in the direction of Miss\nNorthcott as she spoke, but the two were still chatting together near\nthe window. Then she suddenly bent forward to me, with a look of intense\nearnestness upon her face, and said--\n\n“Don’t talk to me any more, please. She does not like it, and I shall\nsuffer for it afterwards. Please, don’t do it.”\n\nI was about to ask her the reason for this strange request, but when she\nsaw I was going to address her, she rose and walked slowly out of the\nroom. As she did so I perceived that the lovers had ceased to talk and\nthat Miss Northcott was looking at me with her keen, grey eyes.\n\n“You must excuse my aunt, Mr. Armitage,” she said; “she is odd, and\neasily fatigued. Come over and look at my album.”\n\nWe spent some time examining the portraits. Miss Northcott’s father and\nmother were apparently ordinary mortals enough, and I could not detect\nin either of them any traces of the character which showed itself in\ntheir daughter’s face. There was one old daguerreotype, however, which\narrested my attention. It represented a man of about the age of forty,\nand strikingly handsome. He was clean shaven, and extraordinary power\nwas expressed upon his prominent lower jaw and firm, straight mouth.\nHis eyes were somewhat deeply set in his head, however, and there was a\nsnake-like flattening at the upper part of his forehead, which detracted\nfrom his appearance. I almost involuntarily, when I saw the head,\npointed to it, and exclaimed--\n\n“There is your prototype in your family, Miss Northcott.”\n\n“Do you think so?” she said. “I am afraid you are paying me a very bad\ncompliment. Uncle Anthony was always considered the black sheep of the\nfamily.”\n\n“Indeed,” I answered; “my remark was an unfortunate one, then.”\n\n“Oh, don’t mind that,” she said; “I always thought myself that he was\nworth all of them put together. He was an officer in the Forty-first\nRegiment, and he was killed in action during the Persian War--so he died\nnobly, at any rate.”\n\n“That’s the sort of death I should like to die,” said Cowles, his dark\neyes flashing, as they would when he was excited; “I often wish I had\ntaken to my father’s profession instead of this vile pill-compounding\ndrudgery.”\n\n“Come, Jack, you are not going to die any sort of death yet,” she said,\ntenderly taking his hand in hers.\n\nI could not understand the woman. There was such an extraordinary\nmixture of masculine decision and womanly tenderness about her, with\nthe consciousness of something all her own in the background, that she\nfairly puzzled me. I hardly knew, therefore, how to answer Cowles\nwhen, as we walked down the street together, he asked the comprehensive\nquestion--\n\n“Well, what do you think of her?”\n\n“I think she is wonderfully beautiful,” I answered guardedly.\n\n“That, of course,” he replied irritably. “You knew that before you\ncame!”\n\n“I think she is very clever too,” I remarked.\n\nBarrington Cowles walked on for some time, and then he suddenly turned\non me with the strange question--\n\n“Do you think she is cruel? Do you think she is the sort of girl who\nwould take a pleasure in inflicting pain?”\n\n“Well, really,” I answered, “I have hardly had time to form an opinion.”\n\nWe then walked on for some time in silence.\n\n“She is an old fool,” at length muttered Cowles. “She is mad.”\n\n“Who is?” I asked.\n\n“Why, that old woman--that aunt of Kate’s--Mrs. Merton, or whatever her\nname is.”\n\nThen I knew that my poor colourless friend had been speaking to Cowles,\nbut he never said anything more as to the nature of her communication.\n\nMy companion went to bed early that night, and I sat up a long time by\nthe fire, thinking over all that I had seen and heard. I felt that there\nwas some mystery about the girl--some dark fatality so strange as to\ndefy conjecture. I thought of Prescott’s interview with her before\ntheir marriage, and the fatal termination of it. I coupled it with poor\ndrunken Reeves’ plaintive cry, “Why did she not tell me sooner?” and\nwith the other words he had spoken. Then my mind ran over Mrs. Merton’s\nwarning to me, Cowles’ reference to her, and even the episode of the\nwhip and the cringing dog.\n\nThe whole effect of my recollections was unpleasant to a degree, and yet\nthere was no tangible charge which I could bring against the woman. It\nwould be worse than useless to attempt to warn my friend until I had\ndefinitely made up my mind what I was to warn him against. He would\ntreat any charge against her with scorn. What could I do? How could I\nget at some tangible conclusion as to her character and antecedents? No\none in Edinburgh knew them except as recent acquaintances. She was an\norphan, and as far as I knew she had never disclosed where her former\nhome had been. Suddenly an idea struck me. Among my father’s friends\nthere was a Colonel Joyce, who had served a long time in India upon the\nstaff, and who would be likely to know most of the officers who had been\nout there since the Mutiny. I sat down at once, and, having trimmed the\nlamp, proceeded to write a letter to the Colonel. I told him that I was\nvery curious to gain some particulars about a certain Captain Northcott,\nwho had served in the Forty-first Foot, and who had fallen in the\nPersian War. I described the man as well as I could from my recollection\nof the daguerreotype, and then, having directed the letter, posted it\nthat very night, after which, feeling that I had done all that could be\ndone, I retired to bed, with a mind too anxious to allow me to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nPART II.\n\nI got an answer from Leicester, where the Colonel resided, within two\ndays. I have it before me as I write, and copy it verbatim.\n\n\n“DEAR BOB,” it said, “I remember the man well. I was with him at\nCalcutta, and afterwards at Hyderabad. He was a curious, solitary sort\nof mortal; but a gallant soldier enough, for he distinguished himself at\nSobraon, and was wounded, if I remember right. He was not popular in\nhis corps--they said he was a pitiless, cold-blooded fellow, with\nno geniality in him. There was a rumour, too, that he was a\ndevil-worshipper, or something of that sort, and also that he had\nthe evil eye, which, of course, was all nonsense. He had some strange\ntheories, I remember, about the power of the human will and the effects\nof mind upon matter.\n\n“How are you getting on with your medical studies? Never forget, my boy,\nthat your father’s son has every claim upon me, and that if I can serve\nyou in any way I am always at your command.--Ever affectionately yours,\n\n“EDWARD JOYCE.\n\n“P.S.--By the way, Northcott did not fall in action. He was killed after\npeace was declared in a crazy attempt to get some of the eternal fire\nfrom the sun-worshippers’ temple. There was considerable mystery about\nhis death.”\n\n\nI read this epistle over several times--at first with a feeling of\nsatisfaction, and then with one of disappointment. I had come on some\ncurious information, and yet hardly what I wanted. He was an eccentric\nman, a devil-worshipper, and rumoured to have the power of the evil eye.\nI could believe the young lady’s eyes, when endowed with that cold, grey\nshimmer which I had noticed in them once or twice, to be capable of any\nevil which human eye ever wrought; but still the superstition was\nan effete one. Was there not more meaning in that sentence which\nfollowed--“He had theories of the power of the human will and of the\neffect of mind upon matter”? I remember having once read a quaint\ntreatise, which I had imagined to be mere charlatanism at the time, of\nthe power of certain human minds, and of effects produced by them at a\ndistance.\n\nWas Miss Northcott endowed with some exceptional power of the sort?\n\nThe idea grew upon me, and very shortly I had evidence which convinced\nme of the truth of the supposition.\n\nIt happened that at the very time when my mind was dwelling upon this\nsubject, I saw a notice in the paper that our town was to be visited by\nDr. Messinger, the well-known medium and mesmerist. Messinger was a man\nwhose performance, such as it was, had been again and again pronounced\nto be genuine by competent judges. He was far above trickery, and had\nthe reputation of being the soundest living authority upon the strange\npseudo-sciences of animal magnetism and electro-biology. Determined,\ntherefore, to see what the human will could do, even against all the\ndisadvantages of glaring footlights and a public platform, I took a\nticket for the first night of the performance, and went with several\nstudent friends.\n\nWe had secured one of the side boxes, and did not arrive until after the\nperformance had begun. I had hardly taken my seat before I recognised\nBarrington Cowles, with his fiancee and old Mrs. Merton, sitting in the\nthird or fourth row of the stalls. They caught sight of me at almost\nthe same moment, and we bowed to each other. The first portion of the\nlecture was somewhat commonplace, the lecturer giving tricks of pure\nlegerdemain, with one or two manifestations of mesmerism, performed\nupon a subject whom he had brought with him. He gave us an exhibition of\nclairvoyance too, throwing his subject into a trance, and then demanding\nparticulars as to the movements of absent friends, and the whereabouts\nof hidden objects all of which appeared to be answered satisfactorily.\nI had seen all this before, however. What I wanted to see now was the\neffect of the lecturer’s will when exerted upon some independent member\nof the audience.\n\nHe came round to that as the concluding exhibition in his performance.\n“I have shown you,” he said, “that a mesmerised subject is entirely\ndominated by the will of the mesmeriser. He loses all power of\nvolition, and his very thoughts are such as are suggested to him by\nthe master-mind. The same end may be attained without any preliminary\nprocess. A strong will can, simply by virtue of its strength, take\npossession of a weaker one, even at a distance, and can regulate the\nimpulses and the actions of the owner of it. If there was one man in\nthe world who had a very much more highly-developed will than any of the\nrest of the human family, there is no reason why he should not be\nable to rule over them all, and to reduce his fellow-creatures to the\ncondition of automatons. Happily there is such a dead level of mental\npower, or rather of mental weakness, among us that such a catastrophe\nis not likely to occur; but still within our small compass there are\nvariations which produce surprising effects. I shall now single out one\nof the audience, and endeavour ‘by the mere power of will’ to compel him\nto come upon the platform, and do and say what I wish. Let me assure you\nthat there is no collusion, and that the subject whom I may select is\nat perfect liberty to resent to the uttermost any impulse which I may\ncommunicate to him.”\n\nWith these words the lecturer came to the front of the platform, and\nglanced over the first few rows of the stalls. No doubt Cowles’ dark\nskin and bright eyes marked him out as a man of a highly nervous\ntemperament, for the mesmerist picked him out in a moment, and fixed his\neyes upon him. I saw my friend give a start of surprise, and then settle\ndown in his chair, as if to express his determination not to yield\nto the influence of the operator. Messinger was not a man whose head\ndenoted any great brain-power, but his gaze was singularly intense and\npenetrating. Under the influence of it Cowles made one or two spasmodic\nmotions of his hands, as if to grasp the sides of his seat, and then\nhalf rose, but only to sink down again, though with an evident effort. I\nwas watching the scene with intense interest, when I happened to catch\na glimpse of Miss Northcott’s face. She was sitting with her eyes fixed\nintently upon the mesmerist, and with such an expression of concentrated\npower upon her features as I have never seen on any other human\ncountenance. Her jaw was firmly set, her lips compressed, and her face\nas hard as if it were a beautiful sculpture cut out of the whitest\nmarble. Her eyebrows were drawn down, however, and from beneath them her\ngrey eyes seemed to sparkle and gleam with a cold light.\n\nI looked at Cowles again, expecting every moment to see him rise and\nobey the mesmerist’s wishes, when there came from the platform a short,\ngasping cry as of a man utterly worn out and prostrated by a prolonged\nstruggle. Messinger was leaning against the table, his hand to his\nforehead, and the perspiration pouring down his face. “I won’t go on,”\n he cried, addressing the audience. “There is a stronger will than\nmine acting against me. You must excuse me for to-night.” The man\nwas evidently ill, and utterly unable to proceed, so the curtain\nwas lowered, and the audience dispersed, with many comments upon the\nlecturer’s sudden indisposition.\n\nI waited outside the hall until my friend and the ladies came out.\nCowles was laughing over his recent experience.\n\n“He didn’t succeed with me, Bob,” he cried triumphantly, as he shook my\nhand. “I think he caught a Tartar that time.”\n\n“Yes,” said Miss Northcott, “I think that Jack ought to be very proud of\nhis strength of mind; don’t you! Mr. Armitage?”\n\n“It took me all my time, though,” my friend said seriously. “You can’t\nconceive what a strange feeling I had once or twice. All the strength\nseemed to have gone out of me--especially just before he collapsed\nhimself.”\n\nI walked round with Cowles in order to see the ladies home. He walked in\nfront with Mrs. Merton, and I found myself behind with the young lady.\nFor a minute or so I walked beside her without making any remark, and\nthen I suddenly blurted out, in a manner which must have seemed somewhat\nbrusque to her--\n\n“You did that, Miss Northcott.”\n\n“Did what?” she asked sharply.\n\n“Why, mesmerised the mesmeriser--I suppose that is the best way of\ndescribing the transaction.”\n\n“What a strange idea!” she said, laughing. “You give me credit for a\nstrong will then?”\n\n“Yes,” I said. “For a dangerously strong one.”\n\n“Why dangerous?” she asked, in a tone of surprise.\n\n“I think,” I answered, “that any will which can exercise such power\nis dangerous--for there is always a chance of its being turned to bad\nuses.”\n\n“You would make me out a very dreadful individual, Mr. Armitage,” she\nsaid; and then looking up suddenly in my face--“You have never liked me.\nYou are suspicious of me and distrust me, though I have never given you\ncause.”\n\nThe accusation was so sudden and so true that I was unable to find any\nreply to it. She paused for a moment, and then said in a voice which was\nhard and cold--\n\n“Don’t let your prejudice lead you to interfere with me, however, or say\nanything to your friend, Mr. Cowles, which might lead to a difference\nbetween us. You would find that to be very bad policy.”\n\nThere was something in the way she spoke which gave an indescribable air\nof a threat to these few words.\n\n“I have no power,” I said, “to interfere with your plans for the future.\nI cannot help, however, from what I have seen and heard, having fears\nfor my friend.”\n\n“Fears!” she repeated scornfully. “Pray what have you seen and heard.\nSomething from Mr. Reeves, perhaps--I believe he is another of your\nfriends?”\n\n“He never mentioned your name to me,” I answered, truthfully enough.\n“You will be sorry to hear that he is dying.” As I said it we passed\nby a lighted window, and I glanced down to see what effect my words had\nupon her. She was laughing--there was no doubt of it; she was laughing\nquietly to herself. I could see merriment in every feature of her face.\nI feared and mistrusted the woman from that moment more than ever.\n\nWe said little more that night. When we parted she gave me a quick,\nwarning glance, as if to remind me of what she had said about the danger\nof interference. Her cautions would have made little difference to me\ncould I have seen my way to benefiting Barrington Cowles by anything\nwhich I might say. But what could I say? I might say that her former\nsuitors had been unfortunate. I might say that I believed her to be\na cruel-hearted woman. I might say that I considered her to possess\nwonderful, and almost preternatural powers. What impression would any\nof these accusations make upon an ardent lover--a man with my friend’s\nenthusiastic temperament? I felt that it would be useless to advance\nthem, so I was silent.\n\nAnd now I come to the beginning of the end. Hitherto much has been\nsurmise and inference and hearsay. It is my painful task to relate now,\nas dispassionately and as accurately as I can, what actually occurred\nunder my own notice, and to reduce to writing the events which preceded\nthe death of my friend.\n\nTowards the end of the winter Cowles remarked to me that he intended\nto marry Miss Northcott as soon as possible--probably some time in the\nspring. He was, as I have already remarked, fairly well off, and the\nyoung lady had some money of her own, so that there was no pecuniary\nreason for a long engagement. “We are going to take a little house out\nat Corstorphine,” he said, “and we hope to see your face at our table,\nBob, as often as you can possibly come.” I thanked him, and tried to\nshake off my apprehensions, and persuade myself that all would yet be\nwell.\n\nIt was about three weeks before the time fixed for the marriage, that\nCowles remarked to me one evening that he feared he would be late that\nnight. “I have had a note from Kate,” he said, “asking me to call about\neleven o’clock to-night, which seems rather a late hour, but perhaps she\nwants to talk over something quietly after old Mrs. Merton retires.”\n\nIt was not until after my friend’s departure that I suddenly recollected\nthe mysterious interview which I had been told of as preceding the\nsuicide of young Prescott. Then I thought of the ravings of poor Reeves,\nrendered more tragic by the fact that I had heard that very day of\nhis death. What was the meaning of it all? Had this woman some baleful\nsecret to disclose which must be known before her marriage? Was it some\nreason which forbade her to marry? Or was it some reason which forbade\nothers to marry her? I felt so uneasy that I would have followed Cowles,\neven at the risk of offending him, and endeavoured to dissuade him from\nkeeping his appointment, but a glance at the clock showed me that I was\ntoo late.\n\nI was determined to wait up for his return, so I piled some coals upon\nthe fire and took down a novel from the shelf. My thoughts proved more\ninteresting than the book, however, and I threw it on one side. An\nindefinable feeling of anxiety and depression weighed upon me. Twelve\no’clock came, and then half-past, without any sign of my friend. It\nwas nearly one when I heard a step in the street outside, and then a\nknocking at the door. I was surprised, as I knew that my friend always\ncarried a key--however, I hurried down and undid the latch. As the\ndoor flew open I knew in a moment that my worst apprehensions had been\nfulfilled. Barrington Cowles was leaning against the railings outside\nwith his face sunk upon his breast, and his whole attitude expressive\nof the most intense despondency. As he passed in he gave a stagger, and\nwould have fallen had I not thrown my left arm around him. Supporting\nhim with this, and holding the lamp in my other hand, I led him slowly\nupstairs into our sitting-room. He sank down upon the sofa without a\nword. Now that I could get a good view of him, I was horrified to see\nthe change which had come over him. His face was deadly pale, and his\nvery lips were bloodless. His cheeks and forehead were clammy, his eyes\nglazed, and his whole expression altered. He looked like a man who had\ngone through some terrible ordeal, and was thoroughly unnerved.\n\n“My dear fellow, what is the matter?” I asked, breaking the silence.\n“Nothing amiss, I trust? Are you unwell?”\n\n“Brandy!” he gasped. “Give me some brandy!”\n\nI took out the decanter, and was about to help him, when he snatched it\nfrom me with a trembling hand, and poured out nearly half a tumbler of\nthe spirit. He was usually a most abstemious man, but he took this off\nat a gulp without adding any water to it.\n\nIt seemed to do him good, for the colour began to come back to his face,\nand he leaned upon his elbow.\n\n“My engagement is off, Bob,” he said, trying to speak calmly, but with a\ntremor in his voice which he could not conceal. “It is all over.”\n\n“Cheer up!” I answered, trying to encourage him.\n\n“Don’t get down on your luck. How was it? What was it all about?”\n\n“About?” he groaned, covering his face with his hands. “If I did\ntell you, Bob, you would not believe it. It is too dreadful--too\nhorrible--unutterably awful and incredible! O Kate, Kate!” and he rocked\nhimself to and fro in his grief; “I pictured you an angel and I find you\na----”\n\n“A what?” I asked, for he had paused.\n\nHe looked at me with a vacant stare, and then suddenly burst out, waving\nhis arms: “A fiend!” he cried. “A ghoul from the pit! A vampire soul\nbehind a lovely face! Now, God forgive me!” he went on in a lower tone,\nturning his face to the wall; “I have said more than I should. I have\nloved her too much to speak of her as she is. I love her too much now.”\n\nHe lay still for some time, and I had hoped that the brandy had had the\neffect of sending him to sleep, when he suddenly turned his face towards\nme.\n\n“Did you ever read of wehr-wolves?” he asked.\n\nI answered that I had.\n\n“There is a story,” he said thoughtfully, “in one of Marryat’s books,\nabout a beautiful woman who took the form of a wolf at night and\ndevoured her own children. I wonder what put that idea into Marryat’s\nhead?”\n\nHe pondered for some minutes, and then he cried out for some more\nbrandy. There was a small bottle of laudanum upon the table, and I\nmanaged, by insisting upon helping him myself, to mix about half a\ndrachm with the spirits. He drank it off, and sank his head once more\nupon the pillow. “Anything better than that,” he groaned. “Death is\nbetter than that. Crime and cruelty; cruelty and crime. Anything is\nbetter than that,” and so on, with the monotonous refrain, until at last\nthe words became indistinct, his eyelids closed over his weary eyes, and\nhe sank into a profound slumber. I carried him into his bedroom without\narousing him; and making a couch for myself out of the chairs, I\nremained by his side all night.\n\nIn the morning Barrington Cowles was in a high fever. For weeks he\nlingered between life and death. The highest medical skill of Edinburgh\nwas called in, and his vigorous constitution slowly got the better of\nhis disease. I nursed him during this anxious time; but through all his\nwild delirium and ravings he never let a word escape him which explained\nthe mystery connected with Miss Northcott. Sometimes he spoke of her\nin the tenderest words and most loving voice. At others he screamed out\nthat she was a fiend, and stretched out his arms, as if to keep her off.\nSeveral times he cried that he would not sell his soul for a beautiful\nface, and then he would moan in a most piteous voice, “But I love her--I\nlove her for all that; I shall never cease to love her.”\n\nWhen he came to himself he was an altered man. His severe illness\nhad emaciated him greatly, but his dark eyes had lost none of their\nbrightness. They shone out with startling brilliancy from under\nhis dark, overhanging brows. His manner was eccentric and\nvariable--sometimes irritable, sometimes recklessly mirthful, but never\nnatural. He would glance about him in a strange, suspicious manner, like\none who feared something, and yet hardly knew what it was he dreaded. He\nnever mentioned Miss Northcott’s name--never until that fatal evening of\nwhich I have now to speak.\n\nIn an endeavour to break the current of his thoughts by frequent change\nof scene, I travelled with him through the highlands of Scotland, and\nafterwards down the east coast. In one of these peregrinations of ours\nwe visited the Isle of May, an island near the mouth of the Firth of\nForth, which, except in the tourist season, is singularly barren and\ndesolate. Beyond the keeper of the lighthouse there are only one or\ntwo families of poor fisher-folk, who sustain a precarious existence by\ntheir nets, and by the capture of cormorants and solan geese. This grim\nspot seemed to have such a fascination for Cowles that we engaged a room\nin one of the fishermen’s huts, with the intention of passing a week\nor two there. I found it very dull, but the loneliness appeared to be a\nrelief to my friend’s mind. He lost the look of apprehension which had\nbecome habitual to him, and became something like his old self.\n\nHe would wander round the island all day, looking down from the summit\nof the great cliffs which gird it round, and watching the long green\nwaves as they came booming in and burst in a shower of spray over the\nrocks beneath.\n\nOne night--I think it was our third or fourth on the island--Barrington\nCowles and I went outside the cottage before retiring to rest, to enjoy\na little fresh air, for our room was small, and the rough lamp caused\nan unpleasant odour. How well I remember every little circumstance\nin connection with that night! It promised to be tempestuous, for the\nclouds were piling up in the north-west, and the dark wrack was drifting\nacross the face of the moon, throwing alternate belts of light and shade\nupon the rugged surface of the island and the restless sea beyond.\n\nWe were standing talking close by the door of the cottage, and I was\nthinking to myself that my friend was more cheerful than he had been\nsince his illness, when he gave a sudden, sharp cry, and looking round\nat him I saw, by the light of the moon, an expression of unutterable\nhorror come over his features. His eyes became fixed and staring, as\nif riveted upon some approaching object, and he extended his long thin\nforefinger, which quivered as he pointed.\n\n“Look there!” he cried. “It is she! It is she! You see her there coming\ndown the side of the brae.” He gripped me convulsively by the wrist as\nhe spoke. “There she is, coming towards us!”\n\n“Who?” I cried, straining my eyes into the darkness.\n\n“She--Kate--Kate Northcott!” he screamed. “She has come for me. Hold me\nfast, old friend. Don’t let me go!”\n\n“Hold up, old man,” I said, clapping him on the shoulder. “Pull yourself\ntogether; you are dreaming; there is nothing to fear.”\n\n“She is gone!” he cried, with a gasp of relief. “No, by heaven! there\nshe is again, and nearer--coming nearer. She told me she would come for\nme, and she keeps her word.”\n\n“Come into the house,” I said. His hand, as I grasped it, was as cold as\nice.\n\n“Ah, I knew it!” he shouted. “There she is, waving her arms. She is\nbeckoning to me. It is the signal. I must go. I am coming, Kate; I am\ncoming!”\n\nI threw my arms around him, but he burst from me with superhuman\nstrength, and dashed into the darkness of the night. I followed him,\ncalling to him to stop, but he ran the more swiftly. When the moon\nshone out between the clouds I could catch a glimpse of his dark figure,\nrunning rapidly in a straight line, as if to reach some definite goal.\nIt may have been imagination, but it seemed to me that in the flickering\nlight I could distinguish a vague something in front of him--a\nshimmering form which eluded his grasp and led him onwards. I saw his\noutlines stand out hard against the sky behind him as he surmounted the\nbrow of a little hill, then he disappeared, and that was the last ever\nseen by mortal eye of Barrington Cowles.\n\nThe fishermen and I walked round the island all that night with\nlanterns, and examined every nook and corner without seeing a trace\nof my poor lost friend. The direction in which he had been running\nterminated in a rugged line of jagged cliffs overhanging the sea. At one\nplace here the edge was somewhat crumbled, and there appeared marks upon\nthe turf which might have been left by human feet. We lay upon our faces\nat this spot, and peered with our lanterns over the edge, looking down\non the boiling surge two hundred feet below. As we lay there, suddenly,\nabove the beating of the waves and the howling of the wind, there rose\na strange wild screech from the abyss below. The fishermen--a naturally\nsuperstitious race--averred that it was the sound of a woman’s laughter,\nand I could hardly persuade them to continue the search. For my own part\nI think it may have been the cry of some sea-fowl startled from its nest\nby the flash of the lantern. However that may be, I never wish to hear\nsuch a sound again.\n\nAnd now I have come to the end of the painful duty which I have\nundertaken. I have told as plainly and as accurately as I could the\nstory of the death of John Barrington Cowles, and the train of events\nwhich preceded it. I am aware that to others the sad episode seemed\ncommonplace enough. Here is the prosaic account which appeared in the\nScotsman a couple of days afterwards:--\n\n\n“Sad Occurrence on the Isle of May.--The Isle of May has been the scene\nof a sad disaster. Mr. John Barrington Cowles, a gentleman well known\nin University circles as a most distinguished student, and the present\nholder of the Neil Arnott prize for physics, has been recruiting his\nhealth in this quiet retreat. The night before last he suddenly left his\nfriend, Mr. Robert Armitage, and he has not since been heard of. It\nis almost certain that he has met his death by falling over the cliffs\nwhich surround the island. Mr. Cowles’ health has been failing for some\ntime, partly from over study and partly from worry connected with family\naffairs. By his death the University loses one of her most promising\nalumni.”\n\n\nI have nothing more to add to my statement. I have unburdened my mind of\nall that I know. I can well conceive that many, after weighing all\nthat I have said, will see no ground for an accusation against Miss\nNorthcott. They will say that, because a man of a naturally excitable\ndisposition says and does wild things, and even eventually commits\nself-murder after a sudden and heavy disappointment, there is no reason\nwhy vague charges should be advanced against a young lady. To this,\nI answer that they are welcome to their opinion. For my own part, I\nascribe the death of William Prescott, of Archibald Reeves, and of John\nBarrington Cowles to this woman with as much confidence as if I had seen\nher drive a dagger into their hearts.\n\nYou ask me, no doubt, what my own theory is which will explain all these\nstrange facts. I have none, or, at best, a dim and vague one. That Miss\nNorthcott possessed extraordinary powers over the minds, and through the\nminds over the bodies, of others, I am convinced, as well as that her\ninstincts were to use this power for base and cruel purposes. That some\neven more fiendish and terrible phase of character lay behind this--some\nhorrible trait which it was necessary for her to reveal before\nmarriage--is to be inferred from the experience of her three lovers,\nwhile the dreadful nature of the mystery thus revealed can only be\nsurmised from the fact that the very mention of it drove from her those\nwho had loved her so passionately. Their subsequent fate was, in my\nopinion, the result of her vindictive remembrance of their desertion of\nher, and that they were forewarned of it at the time was shown by the\nwords of both Reeves and Cowles. Above this, I can say nothing. I lay\nthe facts soberly before the public as they came under my notice. I have\nnever seen Miss Northcott since, nor do I wish to do so. If by the words\nI have written I can save any one human being from the snare of those\nbright eyes and that beautiful face, then I can lay down my pen with the\nassurance that my poor friend has not died altogether in vain.\n\n\n\n\nELIAS B. HOPKINS, THE PARSON OF JACKMAN’S GULCH.\n\nHe was known in the Gulch as the Reverend Elias B. Hopkins, but it was\ngenerally understood that the title was an honorary one, extorted by his\nmany eminent qualities, and not borne out by any legal claim which he\ncould adduce. “The Parson” was another of his sobriquets, which was\nsufficiently distinctive in a land where the flock was scattered and the\nshepherds few. To do him justice, he never pretended to have received\nany preliminary training for the ministry, or any orthodox qualification\nto practise it. “We’re all working in the claim of the Lord,” he\nremarked one day, “and it don’t matter a cent whether we’re hired for\nthe job or whether we waltzes in on our own account,” a piece of rough\nimagery which appealed directly to the instincts of Jackman’s Gulch.\nIt is quite certain that during the first few months his presence had a\nmarked effect in diminishing the excessive use both of strong drinks\nand of stronger adjectives which had been characteristic of the little\nmining settlement. Under his tuition, men began to understand that\nthe resources of their native language were less limited than they had\nsupposed, and that it was possible to convey their impressions with\naccuracy without the aid of a gaudy halo of profanity.\n\nWe were certainly in need of a regenerator at Jackman’s Gulch about\nthe beginning of ‘53. Times were flush then over the whole colony, but\nnowhere flusher than there. Our material prosperity had had a bad effect\nupon our morals. The camp was a small one, lying rather better than a\nhundred and twenty miles to the north of Ballarat, at a spot where a\nmountain torrent finds its way down a rugged ravine on its way to join\nthe Arrowsmith River. History does not relate who the original Jackman\nmay have been, but at the time I speak of the camp it contained a\nhundred or so adults, many of whom were men who had sought an asylum\nthere after making more civilised mining centres too hot to hold\nthem. They were a rough, murderous crew, hardly leavened by the few\nrespectable members of society who were scattered among them.\n\nCommunication between Jackman’s Gulch and the outside world was\ndifficult and uncertain. A portion of the bush between it and Ballarat\nwas infested by a redoubtable outlaw named Conky Jim, who, with a small\nband as desperate as himself, made travelling a dangerous matter. It\nwas customary, therefore, at the Gulch, to store up the dust and nuggets\nobtained from the mines in a special store, each man’s share being\nplaced in a separate bag on which his name was marked. A trusty man,\nnamed Woburn, was deputed to watch over this primitive bank. When the\namount deposited became considerable, a waggon was hired, and the\nwhole treasure was conveyed to Ballarat, guarded by the police and by\na certain number of miners, who took it in turn to perform the office.\nOnce in Ballarat, it was forwarded on to Melbourne by the regular gold\nwaggons. By this plan the gold was often kept for months in the Gulch\nbefore being despatched, but Conky Jim was effectually checkmated, as\nthe escort party were far too strong for him and his gang. He appeared,\nat the time of which I write, to have forsaken his haunts in disgust,\nand the road could be traversed by small parties with impunity.\n\nComparative order used to reign during the daytime at Jackman’s Gulch,\nfor the majority of the inhabitants were out with crowbar and pick among\nthe quartz ledges, or washing clay and sand in their cradles by the\nbanks of the little stream. As the sun sank down, however, the claims\nwere gradually deserted, and their unkempt owners, clay-bespattered and\nshaggy, came lounging into camp, ripe for any form of mischief. Their\nfirst visit was to Woburn’s gold store, where their clean-up of the day\nwas duly deposited, the amount being entered in the storekeeper’s book,\nand each miner retaining enough to cover his evening’s expenses. After\nthat, all restraint was at an end, and each set to work to get rid\nof his surplus dust with the greatest rapidity possible. The focus of\ndissipation was the rough bar, formed by a couple of hogsheads spanned\nby planks, which was dignified by the name of the “Britannia Drinking\nSaloon.” Here Nat Adams, the burly bar-keeper, dispensed bad whisky\nat the rate of two shillings a noggin, or a guinea a bottle, while his\nbrother Ben acted as croupier in a rude wooden shanty behind, which had\nbeen converted into a gambling hell, and was crowded every night. There\nhad been a third brother, but an unfortunate misunderstanding with a\ncustomer had shortened his existence. “He was too soft to live long,”\n his brother Nathaniel feelingly observed, on the occasion of his\nfuneral. “Many’s the time I’ve said to him, ‘If you’re arguin’ a pint\nwith a stranger, you should always draw first, then argue, and then\nshoot, if you judge that he’s on the shoot.’ Bill was too purlite.\nHe must needs argue first and draw after, when he might just as well\nhave kivered his man before talkin’ it over with him.” This amiable\nweakness of the deceased Bill was a blow to the firm of Adams, which\nbecame so short-handed that the concern could hardly be worked without\nthe admission of a partner, which would mean a considerable decrease in\nthe profits.\n\nNat Adams had had a roadside shanty in the Gulch before the discovery\nof gold, and might, therefore, claim to be the oldest inhabitant.\nThese keepers of shanties were a peculiar race, and at the cost of a\ndigression it may be interesting to explain how they managed to amass\nconsiderable sums of money in a land where travellers were few and far\nbetween. It was the custom of the “bushmen,” i.e., bullock-drivers,\nsheep tenders, and the other white hands who worked on the sheep-runs up\ncountry, to sign articles by which they agreed to serve their master for\none, two, or three years at so much per year and certain daily rations.\nLiquor was never included in this agreement, and the men remained, per\nforce, total abstainers during the whole time. The money was paid in a\nlump sum at the end of the engagement. When that day came round,\nJimmy, the stockman, would come slouching into his master’s office,\ncabbage-tree hat in hand.\n\n“Morning, master!” Jimmy would say. “My time’s up. I guess I’ll draw my\ncheque and ride down to town.”\n\n“You’ll come back, Jimmy?”\n\n“Yes, I’ll come back. Maybe I’ll be away three weeks, maybe a month. I\nwant some clothes, master, and my bloomin’ boots are well-nigh off my\nfeet.”\n\n“How much, Jimmy?” asks his master, taking up his pen.\n\n“There’s sixty pound screw,” Jimmy answers thoughtfully; “and you mind,\nmaster, last March, when the brindled bull broke out o’ the paddock. Two\npound you promised me then. And a pound at the dipping. And a pound when\nMillar’s sheep got mixed with ourn;” and so he goes on, for bushmen can\nseldom write, but they have memories which nothing escapes.\n\nHis master writes the cheque and hands it across the table. “Don’t get\non the drink, Jimmy,” he says.\n\n“No fear of that, master,” and the stockman slips the cheque into his\nleather pouch, and within an hour he is ambling off upon his long-limbed\nhorse on his hundred-mile journey to town.\n\nNow Jimmy has to pass some six or eight of the above-mentioned roadside\nshanties in his day’s ride, and experience has taught him that if he\nonce breaks his accustomed total abstinence, the unwonted stimulant has\nan overpowering effect upon his brain. Jimmy shakes his head warily as\nhe determines that no earthly consideration will induce him to partake\nof any liquor until his business is over. His only chance is to avoid\ntemptation; so, knowing that there is the first of these houses some\nhalf-mile ahead, he plunges into a byepath through the bush which will\nlead him out at the other side.\n\nJimmy is riding resolutely along this narrow path, congratulating\nhimself upon a danger escaped, when he becomes aware of a sunburned,\nblack-bearded man who is leaning unconcernedly against a tree beside the\ntrack. This is none other than the shanty-keeper, who, having observed\nJimmy’s manoeuvre in the distance, has taken a short cut through the\nbush in order to intercept him.\n\n“Morning, Jimmy!” he cries, as the horseman comes up to him.\n\n“Morning, mate; morning!”\n\n“Where are ye off to to-day then?”\n\n“Off to town,” says Jimmy sturdily.\n\n“No, now--are you though? You’ll have bully times down there for a bit.\nCome round and have a drink at my place. Just by way of luck.”\n\n“No,” says Jimmy, “I don’t want a drink.”\n\n“Just a little damp.”\n\n“I tell ye I don’t want one,” says the stockman angrily.\n\n“Well, ye needn’t be so darned short about it. It’s nothin’ to me\nwhether you drinks or not. Good mornin’.”\n\n“Good mornin’,” says Jimmy, and has ridden on about twenty yards when he\nhears the other calling on him to stop.\n\n“See here, Jimmy!” he says, overtaking him again. “If you’ll do me a\nkindness when you’re up in town I’d be obliged.”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“It’s a letter, Jim, as I wants posted. It’s an important one too, an’\nI wouldn’t trust it with every one; but I knows you, and if you’ll take\ncharge on it it’ll be a powerful weight off my mind.”\n\n“Give it here,” Jimmy says laconically.\n\n“I hain’t got it here. It’s round in my caboose. Come round for it with\nme. It ain’t more’n quarter of a mile.”\n\nJimmy consents reluctantly. When they reach the tumble-down hut the\nkeeper asks him cheerily to dismount and to come in.\n\n“Give me the letter,” says Jimmy.\n\n“It ain’t altogether wrote yet, but you sit down here for a minute and\nit’ll be right,” and so the stockman is beguiled into the shanty.\n\nAt last the letter is ready and handed over. “Now, Jimmy,” says the\nkeeper, “one drink at my expense before you go.”\n\n“Not a taste,” says Jimmy.\n\n“Oh, that’s it, is it?” the other says in an aggrieved tone. “You’re too\ndamned proud to drink with a poor cove like me. Here--give us back that\nletter. I’m cursed if I’ll accept a favour from a man whose too almighty\nbig to have a drink with me.”\n\n“Well, well, mate, don’t turn rusty,” says Jim. “Give us one drink an’\nI’m off.”\n\nThe keeper pours out about half a pannikin of raw rum and hands it to\nthe bushman. The moment he smells the old familiar smell his longing for\nit returns, and he swigs it off at a gulp. His eyes shine more brightly\nand his face becomes flushed. The keeper watches him narrowly. “You can\ngo now, Jim,” he says.\n\n“Steady, mate, steady,” says the bushman. “I’m as good a man as you. If\nyou stand a drink I can stand one too, I suppose.” So the pannikin is\nreplenished, and Jimmy’s eyes shine brighter still.\n\n“Now, Jimmy, one last drink for the good of the house,” says the keeper,\n“and then it’s time you were off.” The stockman has a third gulp from\nthe pannikin, and with it all his scruples and good resolutions vanish\nfor ever.\n\n“Look here,” he says somewhat huskily, taking his cheque out of his\npouch. “You take this, mate. Whoever comes along this road, ask ‘em what\nthey’ll have, and tell them it’s my shout. Let me know when the money’s\ndone.”\n\nSo Jimmy abandons the idea of ever getting to town, and for three weeks\nor a month he lies about the shanty in a state of extreme drunkenness,\nand reduces every wayfarer upon the road to the same condition. At last\none fine morning the keeper comes to him. “The coin’s done, Jimmy,” he\nsays; “it’s about time you made some more.” So Jimmy has a good wash to\nsober him, straps his blanket and his billy to his back, and rides off\nthrough the bush to the sheeprun, where he has another year of sobriety,\nterminating in another month of intoxication.\n\nAll this, though typical of the happy-go-lucky manners of the\ninhabitants, has no direct bearing upon Jackman’s Gulch, so we must\nreturn to that Arcadian settlement. Additions to the population there\nwere not numerous, and such as came about the time of which I speak were\neven rougher and fiercer than the original inhabitants. In particular,\nthere came a brace of ruffians named Phillips and Maule, who rode into\ncamp one day, and started a claim upon the other side of the stream.\nThey outgulched the Gulch in the virulence and fluency of their\nblasphemy, in the truculence of their speech and manner, and in their\nreckless disregard of all social laws. They claimed to have come from\nBendigo, and there were some amongst us who wished that the redoubted\nConky Jim was on the track once more, as long as he would close it to\nsuch visitors as these. After their arrival the nightly proceedings at\nthe Britannia bar and at the gambling hell behind it became more riotous\nthan ever. Violent quarrels, frequently ending in bloodshed, were of\nconstant occurrence. The more peaceable frequenters of the bar began\nto talk seriously of lynching the two strangers who were the principal\npromoters of disorder. Things were in this unsatisfactory condition\nwhen our evangelist, Elias B. Hopkins, came limping into the camp,\ntravel-stained and footsore, with his spade strapped across his back,\nand his Bible in the pocket of his moleskin jacket.\n\nHis presence was hardly noticed at first, so insignificant was the man.\nHis manner was quiet and unobtrusive, his face pale, and his figure\nfragile. On better acquaintance, however, there was a squareness and\nfirmness about his clean-shaven lower jaw, and an intelligence in his\nwidely-opened blue eyes, which marked him as a man of character. He\nerected a small hut for himself, and started a claim close to that\noccupied by the two strangers who had preceded him. This claim was\nchosen with a ludicrous disregard for all practical laws of mining, and\nat once stamped the newcomer as being a green hand at his work. It was\npiteous to observe him every morning as we passed to our work, digging\nand delving with the greatest industry, but, as we knew well, without\nthe smallest possibility of any result. He would pause for a moment as\nwe went by, wipe his pale face with his bandanna handkerchief, and\nshout out to us a cordial morning greeting, and then fall to again\nwith redoubled energy. By degrees we got into the way of making a\nhalf-pitying, half-contemptuous inquiry as to how he got on. “I hain’t\nstruck it yet, boys,” he would answer cheerily, leaning on his spade,\n“but the bedrock lies deep just hereabouts, and I reckon we’ll get among\nthe pay gravel to-day.” Day after day he returned the same reply with\nunvarying confidence and cheerfulness.\n\nIt was not long before he began to show us the stuff that was in him.\nOne night the proceedings were unusually violent at the drinking saloon.\nA rich pocket had been struck during the day, and the striker was\nstanding treat in a lavish and promiscuous fashion which had reduced\nthree parts of the settlement to a state of wild intoxication. A\ncrowd of drunken idlers stood or lay about the bar, cursing, swearing,\nshouting, dancing, and here and there firing their pistols into the air\nout of pure wantonness. From the interior of the shanty behind there\ncame a similar chorus. Maule, Phillips, and the roughs who followed them\nwere in the ascendant, and all order and decency was swept away.\n\nSuddenly, amid this tumult of oaths and drunken cries, men became\nconscious of a quiet monotone which underlay all other sounds and\nobtruded itself at every pause in the uproar. Gradually first one man\nand then another paused to listen, until there was a general cessation\nof the hubbub, and every eye was turned in the direction whence this\nquiet stream of words flowed. There, mounted upon a barrel, was Elias\nB. Hopkins, the newest of the inhabitants of Jackman’s Gulch, with a\ngood-humoured smile upon his resolute face.\n\nHe held an open Bible in his hand, and was reading aloud a passage taken\nat random--an extract from the Apocalypse, if I remember right. The\nwords were entirely irrelevant and without the smallest bearing upon the\nscene before him, but he plodded on with great unction, waving his left\nhand slowly to the cadence of his words.\n\nThere was a general shout of laughter and applause at this apparition,\nand Jackman’s Gulch gathered round the barrel approvingly, under the\nimpression that this was some ornate joke, and that they were about\nto be treated to some mock sermon or parody of the chapter read. When,\nhowever, the reader, having finished the chapter, placidly commenced\nanother, and having finished that rippled on into another one, the\nrevellers came to the conclusion that the joke was somewhat too\nlong-winded. The commencement of yet another chapter confirmed this\nopinion, and an angry chorus of shouts and cries, with suggestions as to\ngagging the reader or knocking him off the barrel, rose from every side.\nIn spite of roars and hoots, however, Elias B. Hopkins plodded away at\nthe Apocalypse with the same serene countenance, looking as ineffably\ncontented as though the babel around him were the most gratifying\napplause. Before long an occasional boot pattered against the barrel or\nwhistled past our parson’s head; but here some of the more orderly of\nthe inhabitants interfered in favour of peace and order, aided curiously\nenough by the afore-mentioned Maule and Phillips, who warmly espoused\nthe cause of the little Scripture reader. “The little cus has got\ngrit in him,” the latter explained, rearing his bulky red-shirted form\nbetween the crowd and the object of its anger. “His ways ain’t our ways,\nand we’re all welcome to our opinions, and to sling them round from\nbarrels or otherwise if so minded. What I says and Bill says is, that\nwhen it comes to slingin’ boots instead o’ words it’s too steep by\nhalf, an’ if this man’s wronged we’ll chip in an’ see him righted.” This\noratorical effort had the effect of checking the more active signs of\ndisapproval, and the party of disorder attempted to settle down once\nmore to their carouse, and to ignore the shower of Scripture which was\npoured upon them. The attempt was hopeless. The drunken portion fell\nasleep under the drowsy refrain, and the others, with many a sullen\nglance at the imperturbable reader, slouched off to their huts, leaving\nhim still perched upon the barrel. Finding himself alone with the more\norderly of the spectators, the little man rose, closed his book, after\nmethodically marking with a lead pencil the exact spot at which he\nstopped, and descended from his perch. “To-morrow night, boys,” he\nremarked in his quiet voice, “the reading will commence at the 9th verse\nof the 15th chapter of the Apocalypse,” with which piece of information,\ndisregarding our congratulations, he walked away with the air of a man\nwho has performed an obvious duty.\n\nWe found that his parting words were no empty threat. Hardly had the\ncrowd begun to assemble next night before he appeared once more upon the\nbarrel and began to read with the same monotonous vigour, tripping over\nwords! muddling up sentences, but still boring along through chapter\nafter chapter. Laughter, threats, chaff--every weapon short of actual\nviolence--was used to deter him, but all with the same want of success.\nSoon it was found that there was a method in his proceedings. When\nsilence reigned, or when the conversation was of an innocent nature, the\nreading ceased. A single word of blasphemy, however, set it going again,\nand it would ramble on for a quarter of an hour or so, when it stopped,\nonly to be renewed upon similar provocation. The reading was pretty\ncontinuous during that second night, for the language of the opposition\nwas still considerably free. At least it was an improvement upon the\nnight before.\n\nFor more than a month Elias B. Hopkins carried on this campaign. There\nhe would sit, night after night, with the open book upon his knee, and\nat the slightest provocation off he would go, like a musical box when\nthe spring is touched. The monotonous drawl became unendurable, but\nit could only be avoided by conforming to the parson’s code. A chronic\nswearer came to be looked upon with disfavour by the community, since\nthe punishment of his transgression fell upon all. At the end of a\nfortnight the reader was silent more than half the time, and at the end\nof the month his position was a sinecure.\n\nNever was a moral revolution brought about more rapidly and more\ncompletely. Our parson carried his principle into private life. I have\nseen him, on hearing an unguarded word from some worker in the gulches,\nrush across, Bible in hand, and perching himself upon the heap of\nred clay which surmounted the offender’s claim, drawl through the\ngenealogical tree at the commencement of the New Testament in a most\nearnest and impressive manner, as though it were especially appropriate\nto the occasion. In time, an oath became a rare thing amongst us.\nDrunkenness was on the wane too. Casual travellers passing through the\nGulch used to marvel at our state of grace, and rumours of it went as\nfar as Ballarat, and excited much comment therein.\n\nThere were points about our evangelist which made him especially fitted\nfor the work which he had undertaken. A man entirely without redeeming\nvices would have had no common basis on which to work, and no means of\ngaining the sympathy of his flock. As we came to know Elias B. Hopkins\nbetter, we discovered that in spite of his piety there was a leaven of\nold Adam in him, and that he had certainly known unregenerate days.\nHe was no teetotaler. On the contrary, he could choose his liquor with\ndiscrimination, and lower it in an able manner. He played a masterly\nhand at poker, and there were few who could touch him at “cut-throat\neuchre.” He and the two ex-ruffians, Phillips and Maule, used to play\nfor hours in perfect harmony, except when the fall of the cards elicited\nan oath from one of his companions. At the first of these offences\nthe parson would put on a pained smile, and gaze reproachfully at the\nculprit. At the second he would reach for his Bible, and the game was\nover for the evening. He showed us he was a good revolver shot too, for\nwhen we were practising at an empty brandy bottle outside Adams’ bar, he\ntook up a friend’s pistol and hit it plumb in the centre at twenty-four\npaces. There were few things he took up that he could not make a show at\napparently, except gold-digging, and at that he was the veriest duffer\nalive. It was pitiful to see the little canvas bag, with his name\nprinted across it, lying placid and empty upon the shelf at Woburn’s\nstore, while all the other bags were increasing daily, and some had\nassumed quite a portly rotundity of form, for the weeks were slipping\nby, and it was almost time for the gold-train to start off for Ballarat.\nWe reckoned that the amount which we had stored at the time represented\nthe greatest sum which had ever been taken by a single convoy out of\nJackman’s Gulch.\n\nAlthough Elias B. Hopkins appeared to derive a certain quiet\nsatisfaction from the wonderful change which he had effected in the\ncamp, his joy was not yet rounded and complete. There was one thing for\nwhich he still yearned. He opened his heart to us about it one evening.\n\n“We’d have a blessing on the camp, boys,” he said, “if we only had a\nservice o’ some sort on the Lord’s day. It’s a temptin’ o’ Providence\nto go on in this way without takin’ any notice of it, except that maybe\nthere’s more whisky drunk and more card playin’ than on any other day.”\n\n“We hain’t got no parson,” objected one of the crowd.\n\n\n“Ye fool!” growled another, “hain’t we got a man as is worth any three\nparsons, and can splash texts around like clay out o’ a cradle. What\nmore d’ye want?”\n\n“We hain’t got no church!” urged the same dissentient.\n\n“Have it in the open air,” one suggested.\n\n“Or in Woburn’s store,” said another.\n\n“Or in Adams’ saloon.”\n\nThe last proposal was received with a buzz of approval, which showed\nthat it was considered the most appropriate locality.\n\nAdams’ saloon was a substantial wooden building in the rear of the\nbar, which was used partly for storing liquor and partly for a gambling\nsaloon. It was strongly built of rough-hewn logs, the proprietor rightly\njudging, in the unregenerate days of Jackman’s Gulch, that hogsheads of\nbrandy and rum were commodities which had best be secured under lock and\nkey. A strong door opened into each end of the saloon, and the interior\nwas spacious enough, when the table and lumber were cleared away,\nto accommodate the whole population. The spirit barrels were heaped\ntogether at one end by their owner, so as to make a very fair imitation\nof a pulpit.\n\nAt first the Gulch took but a mild interest in the proceedings, but\nwhen it became known that Elias B. Hopkins intended, after reading the\nservice, to address the audience, the settlement began to warm up to\nthe occasion. A real sermon was a novelty to all of them, and one coming\nfrom their own parson was additionally so. Rumour announced that it\nwould be interspersed with local hits, and that the moral would be\npointed by pungent personalities. Men began to fear that they would be\nunable to gain seats, and many applications were made to the brothers\nAdams. It was only when conclusively shown that the saloon could contain\nthem all with a margin that the camp settled down into calm expectancy.\n\nIt was as well that the building was of such a size, for the assembly\nupon the Sunday morning was the largest which had ever occurred in\nthe annals of Jackman’s Gulch. At first it was thought that the whole\npopulation was present, but a little reflection showed that this was\nnot so. Maule and Phillips had gone on a prospecting journey among the\nhills, and had not returned as yet, and Woburn, the gold-keeper, was\nunable to leave his store. Having a very large quantity of the\nprecious metal under his charge, he stuck to his post, feeling that the\nresponsibility was too great to trifle with. With these three exceptions\nthe whole of the Gulch, with clean red shirts, and such other additions\nto their toilet as the occasion demanded, sauntered in a straggling line\nalong the clayey pathway which led up to the saloon.\n\nThe interior of the building had been provided with rough benches, and\nthe parson, with his quiet good-humoured smile, was standing at the door\nto welcome them. “Good morning, boys,” he cried cheerily, as each group\ncame lounging up. “Pass in; pass in. You’ll find this is as good a\nmorning’s work as any you’ve done. Leave your pistols in this barrel\noutside the door as you pass; you can pick them out as you come out\nagain, but it isn’t the thing to carry weapons into the house of peace.”\n His request was good-humouredly complied with, and before the last of\nthe congregation filed in, there was a strange assortment of knives\nand firearms in this depository. When all had assembled, the doors\nwere shut, and the service began--the first and the last which was ever\nperformed at Jackman’s Gulch.\n\nThe weather was sultry and the room close, yet the miners listened with\nexemplary patience. There was a sense of novelty in the situation which\nhad its attractions. To some it was entirely new, others were wafted\nback by it to another land and other days. Beyond a disposition which\nwas exhibited by the uninitiated to applaud at the end of certain\nprayers, by way of showing that they sympathised with the sentiments\nexpressed, no audience could have behaved better. There was a murmur\nof interest, however, when Elias B. Hopkins, looking down on the\ncongregation from his rostrum of casks, began his address.\n\nHe had attired himself with care in honour of the occasion. He wore a\nvelveteen tunic, girt round the waist with a sash of china silk, a pair\nof moleskin trousers, and held his cabbage-tree hat in his left hand.\nHe began speaking in a low tone, and it was noticed at the time that he\nfrequently glanced through the small aperture which served for a window\nwhich was placed above the heads of those who sat beneath him.\n\n“I’ve put you straight now,” he said, in the course of his address;\n“I’ve got you in the right rut if you will but stick in it.” Here he\nlooked very hard out of the window for some seconds. “You’ve learned\nsoberness and industry, and with those things you can always make up any\nloss you may sustain. I guess there isn’t one of ye that won’t remember\nmy visit to this camp.” He paused for a moment, and three revolver shots\nrang out upon the quiet summer air. “Keep your seats, damn ye!” roared\nour preacher, as his audience rose in excitement. “If a man of ye moves\ndown he goes! The door’s locked on the outside, so ye can’t get out\nanyhow. Your seats, ye canting, chuckle-headed fools! Down with ye, ye\ndogs, or I’ll fire among ye!”\n\nAstonishment and fear brought us back into our seats, and we sat staring\nblankly at our pastor and each other. Elias B. Hopkins, whose whole face\nand even figure appeared to have undergone an extraordinary alteration,\nlooked fiercely down on us from his commanding position, with a\ncontemptuous smile on his stern face.\n\n“I have your lives in my hands,” he remarked; and we noticed as he spoke\nthat he held a heavy revolver in his hand, and that the butt of another\none protruded from his sash. “I am armed and you are not. If one of you\nmoves or speaks he is a dead man. If not, I shall not harm you. You must\nwait here for an hour. Why, you FOOLS” (this with a hiss of contempt\nwhich rang in our ears for many a long day), “do you know who it is that\nhas stuck you up? Do you know who it is that has been playing it upon\nyou for months as a parson and a saint? Conky Jim, the bushranger, ye\napes. And Phillips and Maule were my two right-hand men. They’re off\ninto the hills with your gold----Ha! would ye?” This to some restive\nmember of the audience, who quieted down instantly before the fierce eye\nand the ready weapon of the bushranger. “In an hour they will be clear\nof any pursuit, and I advise you to make the best of it, and not to\nfollow, or you may lose more than your money. My horse is tethered\noutside this door behind me. When the time is up I shall pass through\nit, lock it on the outside, and be off. Then you may break your way out\nas best you can. I have no more to say to you, except that ye are the\nmost cursed set of asses that ever trod in boot-leather.”\n\nWe had time to endorse mentally this outspoken opinion during the long\nsixty minutes which followed; we were powerless before the resolute\ndesperado. It is true that if we made a simultaneous rush we might bear\nhim down at the cost of eight or ten of our number. But how could such\na rush be organised without speaking, and who would attempt it without a\nprevious agreement that he would be supported? There was nothing for\nit but submission. It seemed three hours at the least before the ranger\nsnapped up his watch, stepped down from the barrel, walked backwards,\nstill covering us with his weapon, to the door behind him, and then\npassed rapidly through it. We heard the creaking of the rusty lock, and\nthe clatter of his horse’s hoofs, as he galloped away.\n\nIt has been remarked that an oath had, for the last few weeks, been a\nrare thing in the camp. We made up for our temporary abstention during\nthe next half-hour. Never was heard such symmetrical and heartfelt\nblasphemy. When at last we succeeded in getting the door off its hinges\nall sight of both rangers and treasure had disappeared, nor have we ever\ncaught sight of either the one or the other since. Poor Woburn, true to\nhis trust, lay shot through the head across the threshold of his empty\nstore. The villains, Maule and Phillips, had descended upon the camp\nthe instant that we had been enticed into the trap, murdered the keeper,\nloaded up a small cart with the booty, and got safe away to some wild\nfastness among the mountains, where they were joined by their wily\nleader.\n\nJackman’s Gulch recovered from this blow, and is now a flourishing\ntownship. Social reformers are not in request there, however, and\nmorality is at a discount. It is said that an inquest has been held\nlately upon an unoffending stranger who chanced to remark that in so\nlarge a place it would be advisable to have some form of Sunday service.\nThe memory of their one and only pastor is still green among the\ninhabitants, and will be for many a long year to come.\n\n\n\n\nTHE RING OF THOTH.\n\nMr. John Vansittart Smith, F.R.S., of 147-A Gower Street, was a man\nwhose energy of purpose and clearness of thought might have placed\nhim in the very first rank of scientific observers. He was the\nvictim, however, of a universal ambition which prompted him to aim at\ndistinction in many subjects rather than preeminence in one.\n\nIn his early days he had shown an aptitude for zoology and for botany\nwhich caused his friends to look upon him as a second Darwin, but when\na professorship was almost within his reach he had suddenly discontinued\nhis studies and turned his whole attention to chemistry. Here his\nresearches upon the spectra of the metals had won him his fellowship in\nthe Royal Society; but again he played the coquette with his subject,\nand after a year’s absence from the laboratory he joined the Oriental\nSociety, and delivered a paper on the Hieroglyphic and Demotic\ninscriptions of El Kab, thus giving a crowning example both of the\nversatility and of the inconstancy of his talents.\n\nThe most fickle of wooers, however, is apt to be caught at last, and\nso it was with John Vansittart Smith. The more he burrowed his way\ninto Egyptology the more impressed he became by the vast field which it\nopened to the inquirer, and by the extreme importance of a subject which\npromised to throw a light upon the first germs of human civilisation and\nthe origin of the greater part of our arts and sciences. So struck was\nMr. Smith that he straightway married an Egyptological young lady who\nhad written upon the sixth dynasty, and having thus secured a sound\nbase of operations he set himself to collect materials for a work which\nshould unite the research of Lepsius and the ingenuity of Champollion.\nThe preparation of this magnum opus entailed many hurried visits to the\nmagnificent Egyptian collections of the Louvre, upon the last of which,\nno longer ago than the middle of last October, he became involved in a\nmost strange and noteworthy adventure.\n\nThe trains had been slow and the Channel had been rough, so that the\nstudent arrived in Paris in a somewhat befogged and feverish condition.\nOn reaching the Hotel de France, in the Rue Laffitte, he had thrown\nhimself upon a sofa for a couple of hours, but finding that he was\nunable to sleep, he determined, in spite of his fatigue, to make his way\nto the Louvre, settle the point which he had come to decide, and take\nthe evening train back to Dieppe. Having come to this conclusion, he\ndonned his greatcoat, for it was a raw rainy day, and made his way\nacross the Boulevard des Italiens and down the Avenue de l’Opera. Once\nin the Louvre he was on familiar ground, and he speedily made his way to\nthe collection of papyri which it was his intention to consult.\n\nThe warmest admirers of John Vansittart Smith could hardly claim for him\nthat he was a handsome man. His high-beaked nose and prominent chin had\nsomething of the same acute and incisive character which distinguished\nhis intellect. He held his head in a birdlike fashion, and birdlike,\ntoo, was the pecking motion with which, in conversation, he threw out\nhis objections and retorts. As he stood, with the high collar of his\ngreatcoat raised to his ears, he might have seen from the reflection in\nthe glass-case before him that his appearance was a singular one. Yet it\ncame upon him as a sudden jar when an English voice behind him exclaimed\nin very audible tones, “What a queer-looking mortal!”\n\nThe student had a large amount of petty vanity in his composition which\nmanifested itself by an ostentatious and overdone disregard of all\npersonal considerations. He straightened his lips and looked rigidly at\nthe roll of papyrus, while his heart filled with bitterness against the\nwhole race of travelling Britons.\n\n“Yes,” said another voice, “he really is an extraordinary fellow.”\n\n“Do you know,” said the first speaker, “one could almost believe that by\nthe continual contemplation of mummies the chap has become half a mummy\nhimself?”\n\n“He has certainly an Egyptian cast of countenance,” said the other.\n\nJohn Vansittart Smith spun round upon his heel with the intention of\nshaming his countrymen by a corrosive remark or two. To his surprise\nand relief, the two young fellows who had been conversing had their\nshoulders turned towards him, and were gazing at one of the Louvre\nattendants who was polishing some brass-work at the other side of the\nroom.\n\n“Carter will be waiting for us at the Palais Royal,” said one tourist to\nthe other, glancing at his watch, and they clattered away, leaving the\nstudent to his labours.\n\n“I wonder what these chatterers call an Egyptian cast of countenance,”\n thought John Vansittart Smith, and he moved his position slightly in\norder to catch a glimpse of the man’s face. He started as his eyes fell\nupon it. It was indeed the very face with which his studies had made\nhim familiar. The regular statuesque features, broad brow, well-rounded\nchin, and dusky complexion were the exact counterpart of the innumerable\nstatues, mummy-cases, and pictures which adorned the walls of the\napartment.\n\nThe thing was beyond all coincidence. The man must be an Egyptian.\n\nThe national angularity of the shoulders and narrowness of the hips were\nalone sufficient to identify him.\n\nJohn Vansittart Smith shuffled towards the attendant with some intention\nof addressing him. He was not light of touch in conversation, and found\nit difficult to strike the happy mean between the brusqueness of the\nsuperior and the geniality of the equal. As he came nearer, the man\npresented his side face to him, but kept his gaze still bent upon his\nwork. Vansittart Smith, fixing his eyes upon the fellow’s skin, was\nconscious of a sudden impression that there was something inhuman and\npreternatural about its appearance. Over the temple and cheek-bone\nit was as glazed and as shiny as varnished parchment. There was no\nsuggestion of pores. One could not fancy a drop of moisture upon that\narid surface. From brow to chin, however, it was cross-hatched by a\nmillion delicate wrinkles, which shot and interlaced as though Nature\nin some Maori mood had tried how wild and intricate a pattern she could\ndevise.\n\n“Ou est la collection de Memphis?” asked the student, with the awkward\nair of a man who is devising a question merely for the purpose of\nopening a conversation.\n\n“C’est la,” replied the man brusquely, nodding his head at the other\nside of the room.\n\n“Vous etes un Egyptien, n’est-ce pas?” asked the Englishman.\n\nThe attendant looked up and turned his strange dark eyes upon his\nquestioner. They were vitreous, with a misty dry shininess, such as\nSmith had never seen in a human head before. As he gazed into them he\nsaw some strong emotion gather in their depths, which rose and deepened\nuntil it broke into a look of something akin both to horror and to\nhatred.\n\n“Non, monsieur; je suis Francais.” The man turned abruptly and bent\nlow over his polishing. The student gazed at him for a moment in\nastonishment, and then turning to a chair in a retired corner behind\none of the doors he proceeded to make notes of his researches among\nthe papyri. His thoughts, however refused to return into their\nnatural groove. They would run upon the enigmatical attendant with the\nsphinx-like face and the parchment skin.\n\n“Where have I seen such eyes?” said Vansittart Smith to himself. “There\nis something saurian about them, something reptilian. There’s the\nmembrana nictitans of the snakes,” he mused, bethinking himself of his\nzoological studies. “It gives a shiny effect. But there was something\nmore here. There was a sense of power, of wisdom--so I read them--and\nof weariness, utter weariness, and ineffable despair. It may be all\nimagination, but I never had so strong an impression. By Jove, I must\nhave another look at them!” He rose and paced round the Egyptian rooms,\nbut the man who had excited his curiosity had disappeared.\n\nThe student sat down again in his quiet corner, and continued to work\nat his notes. He had gained the information which he required from the\npapyri, and it only remained to write it down while it was still fresh\nin his memory. For a time his pencil travelled rapidly over the paper,\nbut soon the lines became less level, the words more blurred, and\nfinally the pencil tinkled down upon the floor, and the head of the\nstudent dropped heavily forward upon his chest.\n\nTired out by his journey, he slept so soundly in his lonely post behind\nthe door that neither the clanking civil guard, nor the footsteps of\nsightseers, nor even the loud hoarse bell which gives the signal for\nclosing, were sufficient to arouse him.\n\nTwilight deepened into darkness, the bustle from the Rue de Rivoli waxed\nand then waned, distant Notre Dame clanged out the hour of midnight, and\nstill the dark and lonely figure sat silently in the shadow. It was\nnot until close upon one in the morning that, with a sudden gasp and an\nintaking of the breath, Vansittart Smith returned to consciousness.\nFor a moment it flashed upon him that he had dropped asleep in\nhis study-chair at home. The moon was shining fitfully through the\nunshuttered window, however, and, as his eye ran along the lines of\nmummies and the endless array of polished cases, he remembered clearly\nwhere he was and how he came there. The student was not a nervous man.\nHe possessed that love of a novel situation which is peculiar to his\nrace. Stretching out his cramped limbs, he looked at his watch, and\nburst into a chuckle as he observed the hour. The episode would make an\nadmirable anecdote to be introduced into his next paper as a relief\nto the graver and heavier speculations. He was a little cold, but\nwide awake and much refreshed. It was no wonder that the guardians had\noverlooked him, for the door threw its heavy black shadow right across\nhim.\n\nThe complete silence was impressive. Neither outside nor inside was\nthere a creak or a murmur. He was alone with the dead men of a dead\ncivilisation. What though the outer city reeked of the garish nineteenth\ncentury! In all this chamber there was scarce an article, from the\nshrivelled ear of wheat to the pigment-box of the painter, which had\nnot held its own against four thousand years. Here was the flotsam and\njetsam washed up by the great ocean of time from that far-off empire.\nFrom stately Thebes, from lordly Luxor, from the great temples of\nHeliopolis, from a hundred rifled tombs, these relics had been brought.\nThe student glanced round at the long silent figures who flickered\nvaguely up through the gloom, at the busy toilers who were now so\nrestful, and he fell into a reverent and thoughtful mood. An unwonted\nsense of his own youth and insignificance came over him. Leaning back in\nhis chair, he gazed dreamily down the long vista of rooms, all\nsilvery with the moonshine, which extend through the whole wing of the\nwidespread building. His eyes fell upon the yellow glare of a distant\nlamp.\n\nJohn Vansittart Smith sat up on his chair with his nerves all on edge.\nThe light was advancing slowly towards him, pausing from time to time,\nand then coming jerkily onwards. The bearer moved noiselessly. In the\nutter silence there was no suspicion of the pat of a footfall. An idea\nof robbers entered the Englishman’s head. He snuggled up further into\nthe corner. The light was two rooms off. Now it was in the next chamber,\nand still there was no sound. With something approaching to a thrill of\nfear the student observed a face, floating in the air as it were, behind\nthe flare of the lamp. The figure was wrapped in shadow, but the light\nfell full upon the strange eager face. There was no mistaking the\nmetallic glistening eyes and the cadaverous skin. It was the attendant\nwith whom he had conversed.\n\nVansittart Smith’s first impulse was to come forward and address him. A\nfew words of explanation would set the matter clear, and lead doubtless\nto his being conducted to some side door from which he might make his\nway to his hotel. As the man entered the chamber, however, there\nwas something so stealthy in his movements, and so furtive in his\nexpression, that the Englishman altered his intention. This was clearly\nno ordinary official walking the rounds. The fellow wore felt-soled\nslippers, stepped with a rising chest, and glanced quickly from left\nto right, while his hurried gasping breathing thrilled the flame of\nhis lamp. Vansittart Smith crouched silently back into the corner and\nwatched him keenly, convinced that his errand was one of secret and\nprobably sinister import.\n\nThere was no hesitation in the other’s movements. He stepped lightly and\nswiftly across to one of the great cases, and, drawing a key from his\npocket, he unlocked it. From the upper shelf he pulled down a mummy,\nwhich he bore away with him, and laid it with much care and solicitude\nupon the ground. By it he placed his lamp, and then squatting down\nbeside it in Eastern fashion he began with long quivering fingers to\nundo the cerecloths and bandages which girt it round. As the crackling\nrolls of linen peeled off one after the other, a strong aromatic odour\nfilled the chamber, and fragments of scented wood and of spices pattered\ndown upon the marble floor.\n\nIt was clear to John Vansittart Smith that this mummy had never been\nunswathed before. The operation interested him keenly. He thrilled all\nover with curiosity, and his birdlike head protruded further and further\nfrom behind the door. When, however, the last roll had been removed from\nthe four-thousand-year-old head, it was all that he could do to stifle\nan outcry of amazement. First, a cascade of long, black, glossy tresses\npoured over the workman’s hands and arms. A second turn of the bandage\nrevealed a low, white forehead, with a pair of delicately arched\neyebrows. A third uncovered a pair of bright, deeply fringed eyes, and\na straight, well-cut nose, while a fourth and last showed a sweet, full,\nsensitive mouth, and a beautifully curved chin. The whole face was one\nof extraordinary loveliness, save for the one blemish that in the centre\nof the forehead there was a single irregular, coffee-coloured splotch.\nIt was a triumph of the embalmer’s art. Vansittart Smith’s eyes grew\nlarger and larger as he gazed upon it, and he chirruped in his throat\nwith satisfaction.\n\nIts effect upon the Egyptologist was as nothing, however, compared with\nthat which it produced upon the strange attendant. He threw his hands\nup into the air, burst into a harsh clatter of words, and then, hurling\nhimself down upon the ground beside the mummy, he threw his arms round\nher, and kissed her repeatedly upon the lips and brow. “Ma petite!” he\ngroaned in French. “Ma pauvre petite!” His voice broke with emotion, and\nhis innumerable wrinkles quivered and writhed, but the student observed\nin the lamplight that his shining eyes were still as dry and tearless\nas two beads of steel. For some minutes he lay, with a twitching face,\ncrooning and moaning over the beautiful head. Then he broke into a\nsudden smile, said some words in an unknown tongue, and sprang to his\nfeet with the vigorous air of one who has braced himself for an effort.\n\nIn the centre of the room there was a large circular case which\ncontained, as the student had frequently remarked, a magnificent\ncollection of early Egyptian rings and precious stones. To this the\nattendant strode, and, unlocking it, he threw it open. On the ledge at\nthe side he placed his lamp, and beside it a small earthenware jar which\nhe had drawn from his pocket. He then took a handful of rings from the\ncase, and with a most serious and anxious face he proceeded to smear\neach in turn with some liquid substance from the earthen pot, holding\nthem to the light as he did so. He was clearly disappointed with the\nfirst lot, for he threw them petulantly back into the case, and drew out\nsome more. One of these, a massive ring with a large crystal set in it,\nhe seized and eagerly tested with the contents of the jar. Instantly\nhe uttered a cry of joy, and threw out his arms in a wild gesture which\nupset the pot and sent the liquid streaming across the floor to the very\nfeet of the Englishman. The attendant drew a red handkerchief from his\nbosom, and, mopping up the mess, he followed it into the corner, where\nin a moment he found himself face to face with his observer.\n\n“Excuse me,” said John Vansittart Smith, with all imaginable politeness;\n“I have been unfortunate enough to fall asleep behind this door.”\n\n“And you have been watching me?” the other asked in English, with a most\nvenomous look on his corpse-like face.\n\nThe student was a man of veracity. “I confess,” said he, “that I have\nnoticed your movements, and that they have aroused my curiosity and\ninterest in the highest degree.”\n\nThe man drew a long flamboyant-bladed knife from his bosom. “You have\nhad a very narrow escape,” he said; “had I seen you ten minutes ago, I\nshould have driven this through your heart. As it is, if you touch me or\ninterfere with me in any way you are a dead man.”\n\n“I have no wish to interfere with you,” the student answered. “My\npresence here is entirely accidental. All I ask is that you will have\nthe extreme kindness to show me out through some side door.” He spoke\nwith great suavity, for the man was still pressing the tip of his dagger\nagainst the palm of his left hand, as though to assure himself of its\nsharpness, while his face preserved its malignant expression.\n\n“If I thought----” said he. “But no, perhaps it is as well. What is your\nname?”\n\nThe Englishman gave it.\n\n“Vansittart Smith,” the other repeated. “Are you the same Vansittart\nSmith who gave a paper in London upon El Kab? I saw a report of it. Your\nknowledge of the subject is contemptible.”\n\n“Sir!” cried the Egyptologist.\n\n“Yet it is superior to that of many who make even greater pretensions.\nThe whole keystone of our old life in Egypt was not the inscriptions or\nmonuments of which you make so much, but was our hermetic philosophy and\nmystic knowledge, of which you say little or nothing.”\n\n“Our old life!” repeated the scholar, wide-eyed; and then suddenly,\n“Good God, look at the mummy’s face!”\n\nThe strange man turned and flashed his light upon the dead woman,\nuttering a long doleful cry as he did so. The action of the air had\nalready undone all the art of the embalmer. The skin had fallen away,\nthe eyes had sunk inwards, the discoloured lips had writhed away from\nthe yellow teeth, and the brown mark upon the forehead alone showed that\nit was indeed the same face which had shown such youth and beauty a few\nshort minutes before.\n\nThe man flapped his hands together in grief and horror. Then mastering\nhimself by a strong effort he turned his hard eyes once more upon the\nEnglishman.\n\n“It does not matter,” he said, in a shaking voice. “It does not\nreally matter. I came here to-night with the fixed determination to\ndo something. It is now done. All else is as nothing. I have found my\nquest. The old curse is broken. I can rejoin her. What matter about her\ninanimate shell so long as her spirit is awaiting me at the other side\nof the veil!”\n\n“These are wild words,” said Vansittart Smith. He was becoming more and\nmore convinced that he had to do with a madman.\n\n“Time presses, and I must go,” continued the other. “The moment is at\nhand for which I have waited this weary time. But I must show you out\nfirst. Come with me.”\n\nTaking up the lamp, he turned from the disordered chamber, and led the\nstudent swiftly through the long series of the Egyptian, Assyrian, and\nPersian apartments. At the end of the latter he pushed open a small door\nlet into the wall and descended a winding stone stair. The Englishman\nfelt the cold fresh air of the night upon his brow. There was a door\nopposite him which appeared to communicate with the street. To the right\nof this another door stood ajar, throwing a spurt of yellow light across\nthe passage. “Come in here!” said the attendant shortly.\n\nVansittart Smith hesitated. He had hoped that he had come to the end\nof his adventure. Yet his curiosity was strong within him. He could not\nleave the matter unsolved, so he followed his strange companion into the\nlighted chamber.\n\nIt was a small room, such as is devoted to a concierge. A wood fire\nsparkled in the grate. At one side stood a truckle bed, and at the other\na coarse wooden chair, with a round table in the centre, which bore the\nremains of a meal. As the visitor’s eye glanced round he could not but\nremark with an ever-recurring thrill that all the small details of\nthe room were of the most quaint design and antique workmanship. The\ncandlesticks, the vases upon the chimney-piece, the fire-irons, the\nornaments upon the walls, were all such as he had been wont to associate\nwith the remote past. The gnarled heavy-eyed man sat himself down upon\nthe edge of the bed, and motioned his guest into the chair.\n\n“There may be design in this,” he said, still speaking excellent\nEnglish. “It may be decreed that I should leave some account behind as a\nwarning to all rash mortals who would set their wits up against workings\nof Nature. I leave it with you. Make such use as you will of it. I speak\nto you now with my feet upon the threshold of the other world.\n\n“I am, as you surmised, an Egyptian--not one of the down-trodden race\nof slaves who now inhabit the Delta of the Nile, but a survivor of that\nfiercer and harder people who tamed the Hebrew, drove the Ethiopian back\ninto the southern deserts, and built those mighty works which have been\nthe envy and the wonder of all after generations. It was in the reign\nof Tuthmosis, sixteen hundred years before the birth of Christ, that\nI first saw the light. You shrink away from me. Wait, and you will see\nthat I am more to be pitied than to be feared.\n\n“My name was Sosra. My father had been the chief priest of Osiris in\nthe great temple of Abaris, which stood in those days upon the Bubastic\nbranch of the Nile. I was brought up in the temple and was trained in\nall those mystic arts which are spoken of in your own Bible. I was\nan apt pupil. Before I was sixteen I had learned all which the wisest\npriest could teach me. From that time on I studied Nature’s secrets for\nmyself, and shared my knowledge with no man.\n\n“Of all the questions which attracted me there were none over which I\nlaboured so long as over those which concern themselves with the nature\nof life. I probed deeply into the vital principle. The aim of medicine\nhad been to drive away disease when it appeared. It seemed to me that a\nmethod might be devised which should so fortify the body as to prevent\nweakness or death from ever taking hold of it. It is useless that I\nshould recount my researches. You would scarce comprehend them if I\ndid. They were carried out partly upon animals, partly upon slaves, and\npartly on myself. Suffice it that their result was to furnish me with a\nsubstance which, when injected into the blood, would endow the body with\nstrength to resist the effects of time, of violence, or of disease. It\nwould not indeed confer immortality, but its potency would endure for\nmany thousands of years. I used it upon a cat, and afterwards drugged\nthe creature with the most deadly poisons. That cat is alive in Lower\nEgypt at the present moment. There was nothing of mystery or magic in\nthe matter. It was simply a chemical discovery, which may well be made\nagain.\n\n“Love of life runs high in the young. It seemed to me that I had broken\naway from all human care now that I had abolished pain and driven death\nto such a distance. With a light heart I poured the accursed stuff into\nmy veins. Then I looked round for some one whom I could benefit. There\nwas a young priest of Thoth, Parmes by name, who had won my goodwill by\nhis earnest nature and his devotion to his studies. To him I whispered\nmy secret, and at his request I injected him with my elixir. I should\nnow, I reflected, never be without a companion of the same age as\nmyself.\n\n“After this grand discovery I relaxed my studies to some extent, but\nParmes continued his with redoubled energy. Every day I could see him\nworking with his flasks and his distiller in the Temple of Thoth, but\nhe said little to me as to the result of his labours. For my own part,\nI used to walk through the city and look around me with exultation as\nI reflected that all this was destined to pass away, and that only I\nshould remain. The people would bow to me as they passed me, for the\nfame of my knowledge had gone abroad.\n\n“There was war at this time, and the Great King had sent down his\nsoldiers to the eastern boundary to drive away the Hyksos. A Governor,\ntoo, was sent to Abaris, that he might hold it for the King. I had heard\nmuch of the beauty of the daughter of this Governor, but one day as\nI walked out with Parmes we met her, borne upon the shoulders of her\nslaves. I was struck with love as with lightning. My heart went out from\nme. I could have thrown myself beneath the feet of her bearers. This was\nmy woman. Life without her was impossible. I swore by the head of Horus\nthat she should be mine. I swore it to the Priest of Thoth. He turned\naway from me with a brow which was as black as midnight.\n\n“There is no need to tell you of our wooing. She came to love me even\nas I loved her. I learned that Parmes had seen her before I did, and had\nshown her that he too loved her, but I could smile at his passion, for\nI knew that her heart was mine. The white plague had come upon the city\nand many were stricken, but I laid my hands upon the sick and nursed\nthem without fear or scathe. She marvelled at my daring. Then I told her\nmy secret, and begged her that she would let me use my art upon her.\n\n“‘Your flower shall then be unwithered, Atma,’ I said. ‘Other things\nmay pass away, but you and I, and our great love for each other, shall\noutlive the tomb of King Chefru.’\n\n“But she was full of timid, maidenly objections. ‘Was it right?’ she\nasked, ‘was it not a thwarting of the will of the gods? If the great\nOsiris had wished that our years should be so long, would he not himself\nhave brought it about?’\n\n“With fond and loving words I overcame her doubts, and yet she\nhesitated. It was a great question, she said. She would think it over\nfor this one night. In the morning I should know her resolution. Surely\none night was not too much to ask. She wished to pray to Isis for help\nin her decision.\n\n“With a sinking heart and a sad foreboding of evil I left her with her\ntirewomen. In the morning, when the early sacrifice was over, I hurried\nto her house. A frightened slave met me upon the steps. Her mistress\nwas ill, she said, very ill. In a frenzy I broke my way through the\nattendants, and rushed through hall and corridor to my Atma’s chamber.\nShe lay upon her couch, her head high upon the pillow, with a pallid\nface and a glazed eye. On her forehead there blazed a single angry\npurple patch. I knew that hell-mark of old. It was the scar of the white\nplague, the sign-manual of death.\n\n“Why should I speak of that terrible time? For months I was mad,\nfevered, delirious, and yet I could not die. Never did an Arab thirst\nafter the sweet wells as I longed after death. Could poison or steel\nhave shortened the thread of my existence, I should soon have rejoined\nmy love in the land with the narrow portal. I tried, but it was of no\navail. The accursed influence was too strong upon me. One night as I lay\nupon my couch, weak and weary, Parmes, the priest of Thoth, came to my\nchamber. He stood in the circle of the lamplight, and he looked down\nupon me with eyes which were bright with a mad joy.\n\n“‘Why did you let the maiden die?’ he asked; ‘why did you not strengthen\nher as you strengthened me?’\n\n“‘I was too late,’ I answered. ‘But I had forgot. You also loved her.\nYou are my fellow in misfortune. Is it not terrible to think of the\ncenturies which must pass ere we look upon her again? Fools, fools, that\nwe were to take death to be our enemy!’\n\n“‘You may say that,’ he cried with a wild laugh; ‘the words come well\nfrom your lips. For me they have no meaning.’\n\n“‘What mean you?’ I cried, raising myself upon my elbow. ‘Surely,\nfriend, this grief has turned your brain.’ His face was aflame with joy,\nand he writhed and shook like one who hath a devil.\n\n“‘Do you know whither I go?’ he asked.\n\n“‘Nay,’ I answered, ‘I cannot tell.’\n\n“‘I go to her,’ said he. ‘She lies embalmed in the further tomb by the\ndouble palm-tree beyond the city wall.’\n\n“‘Why do you go there?’ I asked.\n\n“‘To die!’ he shrieked, ‘to die! I am not bound by earthen fetters.’\n\n“‘But the elixir is in your blood,’ I cried.\n\n“‘I can defy it,’ said he; ‘I have found a stronger principle which will\ndestroy it. It is working in my veins at this moment, and in an hour I\nshall be a dead man. I shall join her, and you shall remain behind.’\n\n“As I looked upon him I could see that he spoke words of truth. The\nlight in his eye told me that he was indeed beyond the power of the\nelixir.\n\n“‘You will teach me!’ I cried.\n\n“‘Never!’ he answered.\n\n“‘I implore you, by the wisdom of Thoth, by the majesty of Anubis!’\n\n“‘It is useless,’ he said coldly.\n\n“‘Then I will find it out,’ I cried.\n\n“‘You cannot,’ he answered; ‘it came to me by chance. There is one\ningredient which you can never get. Save that which is in the ring of\nThoth, none will ever more be made.\n\n“‘In the ring of Thoth!’ I repeated; ‘where then is the ring of Thoth?’\n\n“‘That also you shall never know,’ he answered. ‘You won her love.\nWho has won in the end? I leave you to your sordid earth life. My\nchains are broken. I must go!’ He turned upon his heel and fled from the\nchamber. In the morning came the news that the Priest of Thoth was dead.\n\n“My days after that were spent in study. I must find this subtle poison\nwhich was strong enough to undo the elixir. From early dawn to midnight\nI bent over the test-tube and the furnace. Above all, I collected the\npapyri and the chemical flasks of the Priest of Thoth. Alas! they taught\nme little. Here and there some hint or stray expression would raise hope\nin my bosom, but no good ever came of it. Still, month after month, I\nstruggled on. When my heart grew faint I would make my way to the tomb\nby the palm-trees. There, standing by the dead casket from which the\njewel had been rifled, I would feel her sweet presence, and would\nwhisper to her that I would rejoin her if mortal wit could solve the\nriddle.\n\n“Parmes had said that his discovery was connected with the ring of\nThoth. I had some remembrance of the trinket. It was a large and weighty\ncirclet, made, not of gold, but of a rarer and heavier metal brought\nfrom the mines of Mount Harbal. Platinum, you call it. The ring had,\nI remembered, a hollow crystal set in it, in which some few drops of\nliquid might be stored. Now, the secret of Parmes could not have to do\nwith the metal alone, for there were many rings of that metal in the\nTemple. Was it not more likely that he had stored his precious poison\nwithin the cavity of the crystal? I had scarce come to this conclusion\nbefore, in hunting through his papers, I came upon one which told me\nthat it was indeed so, and that there was still some of the liquid\nunused.\n\n“But how to find the ring? It was not upon him when he was stripped\nfor the embalmer. Of that I made sure. Neither was it among his private\neffects. In vain I searched every room that he had entered, every box,\nand vase, and chattel that he had owned. I sifted the very sand of the\ndesert in the places where he had been wont to walk; but, do what I\nwould, I could come upon no traces of the ring of Thoth. Yet it may be\nthat my labours would have overcome all obstacles had it not been for a\nnew and unlooked-for misfortune.\n\n“A great war had been waged against the Hyksos, and the Captains of the\nGreat King had been cut off in the desert, with all their bowmen and\nhorsemen. The shepherd tribes were upon us like the locusts in a dry\nyear. From the wilderness of Shur to the great bitter lake there was\nblood by day and fire by night. Abaris was the bulwark of Egypt, but\nwe could not keep the savages back. The city fell. The Governor and the\nsoldiers were put to the sword, and I, with many more, was led away into\ncaptivity.\n\n“For years and years I tended cattle in the great plains by the\nEuphrates. My master died, and his son grew old, but I was still as far\nfrom death as ever. At last I escaped upon a swift camel, and made my\nway back to Egypt. The Hyksos had settled in the land which they had\nconquered, and their own King ruled over the country. Abaris had been\ntorn down, the city had been burned, and of the great Temple there was\nnothing left save an unsightly mound. Everywhere the tombs had been\nrifled and the monuments destroyed. Of my Atma’s grave no sign was\nleft. It was buried in the sands of the desert, and the palm-trees\nwhich marked the spot had long disappeared. The papers of Parmes and the\nremains of the Temple of Thoth were either destroyed or scattered far\nand wide over the deserts of Syria. All search after them was vain.\n\n“From that time I gave up all hope of ever finding the ring or\ndiscovering the subtle drug. I set myself to live as patiently as\nmight be until the effect of the elixir should wear away. How can you\nunderstand how terrible a thing time is, you who have experience only of\nthe narrow course which lies between the cradle and the grave! I know it\nto my cost, I who have floated down the whole stream of history. I was\nold when Ilium fell. I was very old when Herodotus came to Memphis. I\nwas bowed down with years when the new gospel came upon earth. Yet you\nsee me much as other men are, with the cursed elixir still sweetening my\nblood, and guarding me against that which I would court. Now at last, at\nlast I have come to the end of it!\n\n“I have travelled in all lands and I have dwelt with all nations. Every\ntongue is the same to me. I learned them all to help pass the weary\ntime. I need not tell you how slowly they drifted by, the long dawn\nof modern civilisation, the dreary middle years, the dark times of\nbarbarism. They are all behind me now, I have never looked with the eyes\nof love upon another woman. Atma knows that I have been constant to her.\n\n“It was my custom to read all that the scholars had to say upon Ancient\nEgypt. I have been in many positions, sometimes affluent, sometimes\npoor, but I have always found enough to enable me to buy the journals\nwhich deal with such matters. Some nine months ago I was in San\nFrancisco, when I read an account of some discoveries made in the\nneighbourhood of Abaris. My heart leapt into my mouth as I read it.\nIt said that the excavator had busied himself in exploring some tombs\nrecently unearthed. In one there had been found an unopened mummy with\nan inscription upon the outer case setting forth that it contained\nthe body of the daughter of the Governor of the city in the days of\nTuthmosis. It added that on removing the outer case there had been\nexposed a large platinum ring set with a crystal, which had been laid\nupon the breast of the embalmed woman. This, then was where Parmes\nhad hid the ring of Thoth. He might well say that it was safe, for no\nEgyptian would ever stain his soul by moving even the outer case of a\nburied friend.\n\n“That very night I set off from San Francisco, and in a few weeks I\nfound myself once more at Abaris, if a few sand-heaps and crumbling\nwalls may retain the name of the great city. I hurried to the Frenchmen\nwho were digging there and asked them for the ring. They replied that\nboth the ring and the mummy had been sent to the Boulak Museum at Cairo.\nTo Boulak I went, but only to be told that Mariette Bey had claimed them\nand had shipped them to the Louvre. I followed them, and there at last,\nin the Egyptian chamber, I came, after close upon four thousand years,\nupon the remains of my Atma, and upon the ring for which I had sought so\nlong.\n\n“But how was I to lay hands upon them? How was I to have them for my\nvery own? It chanced that the office of attendant was vacant. I went\nto the Director. I convinced him that I knew much about Egypt. In my\neagerness I said too much. He remarked that a Professor’s chair would\nsuit me better than a seat in the Conciergerie. I knew more, he said,\nthan he did. It was only by blundering, and letting him think that he\nhad over-estimated my knowledge, that I prevailed upon him to let me\nmove the few effects which I have retained into this chamber. It is my\nfirst and my last night here.\n\n“Such is my story, Mr. Vansittart Smith. I need not say more to a man of\nyour perception. By a strange chance you have this night looked upon the\nface of the woman whom I loved in those far-off days. There were many\nrings with crystals in the case, and I had to test for the platinum to\nbe sure of the one which I wanted. A glance at the crystal has shown me\nthat the liquid is indeed within it, and that I shall at last be able\nto shake off that accursed health which has been worse to me than the\nfoulest disease. I have nothing more to say to you. I have unburdened\nmyself. You may tell my story or you may withhold it at your pleasure.\nThe choice rests with you. I owe you some amends, for you have had a\nnarrow escape of your life this night. I was a desperate man, and not\nto be baulked in my purpose. Had I seen you before the thing was done,\nI might have put it beyond your power to oppose me or to raise an alarm.\nThis is the door. It leads into the Rue de Rivoli. Good night!”\n\nThe Englishman glanced back. For a moment the lean figure of Sosra\nthe Egyptian stood framed in the narrow doorway. The next the door had\nslammed, and the heavy rasping of a bolt broke on the silent night.\n\nIt was on the second day after his return to London that Mr. John\nVansittart Smith saw the following concise narrative in the Paris\ncorrespondence of the Times:--\n\n“Curious Occurrence in the Louvre.--Yesterday morning a strange\ndiscovery was made in the principal Egyptian Chamber. The ouvriers who\nare employed to clean out the rooms in the morning found one of the\nattendants lying dead upon the floor with his arms round one of the\nmummies. So close was his embrace that it was only with the utmost\ndifficulty that they were separated. One of the cases containing\nvaluable rings had been opened and rifled. The authorities are of\nopinion that the man was bearing away the mummy with some idea of\nselling it to a private collector, but that he was struck down in the\nvery act by long-standing disease of the heart. It is said that he was a\nman of uncertain age and eccentric habits, without any living relations\nto mourn over his dramatic and untimely end.”",
