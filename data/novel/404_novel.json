While preparing that work he\nfrequently came across the tracks of celebrated inventors, mechanics,\nand iron-workers--the founders, in a great measure, of the modern\nindustry of Britain--whose labours seemed to him well worthy of being\ntraced out and placed on record, and the more so as their lives\npresented many points of curious and original interest.  Having been\nencouraged to prosecute the subject by offers of assistance from some\nof the most eminent living mechanical engineers, he is now enabled to\npresent the following further series of memoirs to the public.\n\nWithout exaggerating the importance of this class of biography, it may\nat least be averred that it has not yet received its due share of\nattention.  While commemorating the labours and honouring the names of\nthose who have striven to elevate man above the material and\nmechanical, the labours of the important industrial class to whom\nsociety owes so much of its comfort and well-being are also entitled to\nconsideration.  Without derogating from the biographic claims of those\nwho minister to intellect and taste, those who minister to utility need\nnot be overlooked.  When a Frenchman was praising to Sir John Sinclair\nthe artist who invented ruffles, the Baronet shrewdly remarked that\nsome merit was also due to the man who added the shirt.\n\nA distinguished living mechanic thus expresses himself to the Author on\nthis point:--\"Kings, warriors, and statesmen have heretofore\nmonopolized not only the pages of history, but almost those of\nbiography.  Surely some niche ought to be found for the Mechanic,\nwithout whose skill and labour society, as it is, could not exist.  I\ndo not begrudge destructive heroes their fame, but the constructive\nones ought not to be forgotten; and there IS a heroism of skill and\ntoil belonging to the latter class, worthy of as grateful record,--less\nperilous and romantic, it may be, than that of the other, but not less\nfull of the results of human energy, bravery, and character.  The lot\nof labour is indeed often a dull one; and it is doing a public service\nto endeavour to lighten it up by records of the struggles and triumphs\nof our more illustrious workers, and the results of their labours in\nthe cause of human advancement.\"\n\nAs respects the preparation of the following memoirs, the Author's\nprincipal task has consisted in selecting and arranging the materials\nso liberally placed at his disposal by gentlemen for the most part\npersonally acquainted with the subjects of them, and but for whose\nassistance the book could not have been written.  The materials for the\nbiography of Henry Maudslay, for instance, have been partly supplied by\nthe late Mr. Joshua Field, F.R.S. (his partner), but principally by Mr.\nJames Nasmyth, C.E., his distinguished pupil.  In like manner Mr. John\nPenn, C.E., has supplied the chief materials for the memoir of Joseph\nClement, assisted by Mr. Wilkinson, Clement's nephew.  The Author has\nalso had the valuable assistance of Mr. William Fairbairn, F.R.S., Mr.\nJ. O. March, tool manufacturer (Mayor of Leeds), Mr. Richard Roberts,\nC.E., Mr. Henry Maudslay, C.E., and Mr. J. Kitson, Jun., iron\nmanufacturer, Leeds, in the preparation of the other memoirs of\nmechanical engineers included in this volume.\n\nThe materials for the memoirs of the early iron-workers have in like\nmanner been obtained for the most part from original sources; those of\nthe Darbys and Reynoldses from Mr. Dickinson of Coalbrookdale, Mr.\nWilliam Reynolds of Coed-du, and Mr. William G. Norris of the former\nplace, as well as from Mr. Anstice of Madeley Wood, who has kindly\nsupplied the original records of the firm.  The substance of the\nbiography of Benjamin Huntsman, the inventor of cast-steel, has been\nfurnished by his lineal representatives; and the facts embodied in the\nmemoirs of Henry Cort and David Mushet have been supplied by the sons\nof those inventors.  To Mr. Anderson Kirkwood of Glasgow the Author is\nindebted for the memoir of James Beaumont Neilson, inventor of the hot\nblast; and to Mr. Ralph Moore, Inspector of Mines in Scotland, for\nvarious information relative to the progress of the Scotch iron\nmanufacture.\n\nThe memoirs of Dud Dudley and Andrew Yarranton are almost the only ones\nof the series in preparing which material assistance has been derived\nfrom books; but these have been largely illustrated by facts contained\nin original documents preserved in the State Paper Office, the careful\nexamination of which has been conducted by Mr. W. Walker Wilkins.\n\nIt will thus be observed that most of the information embodied in this\nvolume, more especially that relating to the inventors of tools and\nmachines, has heretofore existed only in the memories of the eminent\nmechanical engineers from whom it has been collected.  The estimable\nJoshua Field has died since the date at which he communicated his\nrecollections; and in a few more years many of the facts which have\nbeen caught and are here placed on record would, probably, in the\nordinary course of things, have passed into oblivion.  As it is, the\nAuthor feels that there are many gaps yet to be filled up; but the\nfield of Industrial Biography is a wide one, and is open to all who\nwill labour in it.\n\nLondon, October, 1863.\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nIRON AND CIVILIZATION.\n\n  The South Sea Islanders and iron\n  Uses of iron for tools\n  The Stone, Bronze, and Iron ages\n  Recent discoveries in the beds of the Swiss lakes\n  Iron the last metal to come into general use, and why\n  The first iron smelters\n  Early history of iron in Britain\n  The Romans\n  Social importance of the Smith in early times\n  Enchanted swords\n  Early scarcity of iron in Scotland\n  Andrea de Ferrara\n  Scarcity of iron in England at the time of the Armada\n  Importance of iron for national defence\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nBEGINNINGS OF THE IRON-MANUFACTURER IN BRITAIN.\n\n  Iron made in the Forest of Dean in Anglo-Saxon times\n  Monkish iron-workers\n  Early iron-smelting in Yorkshire\n  Much iron imported from abroad\n  Iron manufactures of Sussex\n  Manufacture of cannon\n  Wealthy ironmasters of Sussex\n  Founder of the Gale family\n  Extensive exports of English ordnance\n  Destruction of timber in iron-smelting\n  The manufacture placed under restrictions\n  The Sussex furnaces blown out\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nIRON SMELTING BY PIT-COAL--DUD DUDLEY.\n\n  Greatly reduced production of English iron\n  Proposal to use pit-coal instead of charcoal of wood in smelting\n  Sturtevant's patent\n  Rovenson's\n  Dud Dudley;

Captain Cook says that one of them,\nafter resisting all other temptations, \"was at length ensnared by the\ncharms of basket of nails.\"  Another lurked about for several days,\nwatching the opportunity to steal a coal-rake.\n\nThe navigators found they could pay their way from island to island\nmerely with scraps of iron, which were as useful for the purpose as\ngold coins would have been in Europe.  The drain, however, being\ncontinuous, Captain Cook became alarmed at finding his currency almost\nexhausted; and he relates his joy on recovering an old anchor which the\nFrench Captain Bougainville had lost at Bolabola, on which he felt as\nan English banker would do after a severe run upon him for gold, when\nsuddenly placed in possession of a fresh store of bullion.\n\nThe avidity for iron displayed by these poor islanders will not be\nwondered at when we consider that whoever among them was so fortunate\nas to obtain possession of an old nail, immediately became a man of\ngreater power than his fellows, and assumed the rank of a capitalist.\n\"An Otaheitan chief,\" says Cook, \"who had got two nails in his\npossession, received no small emolument by letting out the use of them\nto his neighbours for the purpose of boring holes when their own\nmethods failed, or were thought too tedious.\"\n\nThe native methods referred to by Cook were of a very clumsy sort; the\nprincipal tools of the Otaheitans being of wood, stone, and flint.\nTheir adzes and axes were of stone.  The gouge most commonly used by\nthem was made out of the bone of the human forearm.  Their substitute\nfor a knife was a shell, or a bit of flint or jasper.  A shark's tooth,\nfixed to a piece of wood, served for an auger; a piece of coral for a\nfile; and the skin of a sting-ray for a polisher.  Their saw was made\nof jagged fishes' teeth fixed on the convex edge of a piece of hard\nwood.  Their weapons were of a similarly rude description; their clubs\nand axes were headed with stone, and their lances and arrows were\ntipped with flint.  Fire was another agency employed by them, usually\nin boat-building.  Thus, the New Zealanders, whose tools were also of\nstone, wood, or bone, made their boats of the trunks of trees hollowed\nout by fire.\n\nThe stone implements were fashioned, Captain Cook says, by rubbing one\nstone upon another until brought to the required shape; but, after all,\nthey were found very inefficient for their purpose.  They soon became\nblunted and useless; and the laborious process of making new tools had\nto be begun again.  The delight of the islanders at being put in\npossession of a material which was capable of taking a comparatively\nsharp edge and keeping it, may therefore readily be imagined; and hence\nthe remarkable incidents to which we have referred in the experience of\nthe early voyagers.  In the minds of the natives, iron became the\nrepresentative of power, efficiency, and wealth; and they were ready\nalmost to fall down and worship their new tools, esteeming the axe as a\ndeity, offering sacrifices to the saw, and holding the knife in\nespecial veneration.\n\nIn the infancy of all nations the same difficulties must have been\nexperienced for want of tools, before the arts of smelting and working\nin metals had become known; and it is not improbable that the\nPhoenician navigators who first frequented our coasts found the same\navidity for bronze and iron existing among the poor woad-stained\nBritons who flocked down to the shore to see their ships and exchange\nfood and skins with them, that Captain Cook discovered more than two\nthousand years later among the natives of Otaheite and New Zealand.\nFor, the tools and weapons found in ancient burying-places in all parts\nof Britain clearly show that these islands also have passed through the\nepoch of stone and flint.\n\nThere was recently exhibited at the Crystal Palace a collection of\nancient European weapons and implements placed alongside a similar\ncollection of articles brought from the South Seas; and they were in\nmost respects so much alike that it was difficult to believe that they\ndid not belong to the same race and period, instead of being the\nimplements of races sundered by half the globe, and living at periods\nmore than two thousand years apart.  Nearly every weapon in the one\ncollection had its counterpart in the other,--the mauls or celts of\nstone, the spearheads of flint or jasper, the arrowheads of flint or\nbone, and the saws of jagged stone, showing how human ingenuity, under\nlike circumstances, had resorted to like expedients.  It would also\nappear that the ancient tribes in these islands, like the New\nZealanders, used fire to hollow out their larger boats; several\nspecimens of this kind of vessel having recently been dug up in the\nvalleys of the Witham and the Clyde, some of the latter from under the\nvery streets of modern Glasgow.[1]  Their smaller boats, or coracles,\nwere made of osiers interwoven, covered with hides, and rigged with\nleathern sails and thong tackle.\n\nIt will readily be imagined that anything like civilization, as at\npresent understood, must have been next to impossible under such\ncircumstances.  \"Miserable indeed,\" says Carlyle, \"was the condition of\nthe aboriginal savage, glaring fiercely from under his fleece of hair,\nwhich with the beard reached down to his loins, and hung round them\nlike a matted cloak; the rest of his body sheeted in its thick natural\nfell.  He loitered in the sunny glades of the forest, living on wild\nfruits; or, as the ancient Caledonians, squatted himself in morasses,\nlurking for his bestial or human prey; without implements, without\narms, save the ball of heavy flint, to which, that his sole possession\nand defence might not be lost, he had attached a long cord of plaited\nthongs; thereby recovering as well as hurling it with deadly, unerring\nskill.\"\n\nThe injunction given to man to \"replenish the earth and subdue it\"\ncould not possibly be fulfilled with implements of stone.  To fell a\ntree with a flint hatchet would occupy the labour of a month, and to\nclear a small patch of ground for purposes of culture would require the\ncombined efforts of a tribe.  For the same reason, dwellings could not\nbe erected; and without dwellings domestic tranquillity, security,\nculture, and refinement, especially in a rude climate, were all but\nimpossible.  Mr. Emerson well observes, that \"the effect of a house is\nimmense on human tranquillity, power, and refinement.  A man in a cave\nor a camp--a nomad--dies with no more estate than the wolf or the horse\nleaves.  But so simple a labour as a house being achieved, his  chief\nenemies are kept at bay.  He is safe from the teeth of wild animals,\nfrom frost, sunstroke, and weather; and fine faculties begin to yield\ntheir fine harvest.  Inventions and arts are born, manners, and social\nbeauty and delight.\"  But to build a house which should serve for\nshelter, for safety, and for comfort--in a word, as a home for the\nfamily, which is the nucleus of society--better tools than those of\nstone were absolutely indispensable.\n\nHence most of the early European tribes were nomadic:  first hunters,\nwandering about from place to place like the American Indians, after\nthe game; then shepherds, following the herds of animals which they had\nlearnt to tame, from one grazing-ground to another, living upon their\nmilk and flesh, and clothing themselves in their skins held together by\nleathern thongs.  It was only when implements of metal had been\ninvented that it was possible to practise the art of agriculture with\nany considerable success.  Then tribes would cease from their\nwanderings, and begin to form settlements, homesteads, villages, and\ntowns.  An old Scandinavian legend thus curiously illustrates this last\nperiod:--There was a giantess whose daughter one day saw a husbandman\nploughing in the field.  She ran and picked him up with her finger and\nthumb, put him and his plough and oxen into her apron, and carried them\nto her mother, saying, \"Mother, what sort of beetle is this that I have\nfound wriggling in the sand?\" But the mother said, \"Put it away, my\nchild; we must begone out of this land, for these people will dwell in\nit.\"\n\nM. Worsaae of Copenhagen, who has been followed by other antiquaries,\nhas even gone so far as to divide the natural history of civilization\ninto three epochs, according to the character of the tools used in\neach.  The first was the Stone period, in which the implements chiefly\nused were sticks, bones, stones, and flints.  The next was the Bronze\nperiod, distinguished by the introduction and general use of a metal\ncomposed of copper and tin, requiring a comparatively low degree of\ntemperature to smelt it, and render it capable of being fashioned into\nweapons, tools, and implements; to make which, however, indicated a\ngreat advance in experience, sagacity, and skill in the manipulation of\nmetals.  With tools of bronze, to which considerable hardness could be\ngiven, trees were felled, stones hewn, houses and ships built, and\nagriculture practised with comparative facility.  Last of all came the\nIron period, when the art of smelting and working that most difficult\nbut widely diffused of the minerals was discovered; from which point\nthe progress made in all the arts of life has been of the most\nremarkable character.\n\nAlthough Mr. Wright rejects this classification as empirical, because\nthe periods are not capable of being clearly defined, and all the three\nkinds of implements are found to have been in use at or about the same\ntime,[2] there is, nevertheless, reason to believe that it is, on the\nwhole, well founded.  It is doubtless true that implements of stone\ncontinued in use long after those of bronze and iron had been invented,\narising most probably from the dearness and scarcity of articles of\nmetal; but when the art of smelting and working in iron and steel had\nsufficiently advanced, the use of stone, and afterwards of bronze tools\nand weapons, altogether ceased.\n\nThe views of M. Worsaae, and the other Continental antiquarians who\nfollow his classification, have indeed received remarkable confirmation\nof late years, by the discoveries which have been made in the beds of\nmost of the Swiss lakes.[3]  It appears that a subsidence took place in\nthe waters of the Lake of Zurich in the year 1854, laying bare\nconsiderable portions of its bed.  The adjoining proprietors proceeded\nto enclose the new land, and began by erecting permanent dykes to\nprevent the return of the waters.  While carrying on the works, several\nrows of stakes were exposed; and on digging down, the labourers turned\nup a number of pieces of charred wood, stones blackened by fire,\nutensils, bones, and other articles, showing that at some remote\nperiod, a number of human beings had lived over the spot, in dwellings\nsupported by stakes driven into the bed of the lake.\n\nThe discovery having attracted attention, explorations were made at\nother places, and it was shortly found that there was scarcely a lake\nin Switzerland which did not yield similar evidence of the existence of\nan ancient Lacustrine or Lake-dwelling population.  Numbers of their\ntools and implements were brought to light--stone axes and saws, flint\narrowheads, bone needles, and such like--mixed with the bones of wild\nanimals slain in the chase; pieces of old boats, portions of twisted\nbranches, bark, and rough planking, of which their dwellings had been\nformed, the latter still bearing the marks of the rude tools by which\nthey had been laboriously cut.  In the most ancient, or lowest series\nof deposits, no traces of metal, either of bronze or iron, were\ndiscovered; and it is most probable that these lake-dwellers lived in\nas primitive a state as the South Sea islanders discovered by Captain\nCook, and that the huts over the water in which they lived resembled\nthose found in Papua and Borneo, and the islands of the Salomon group,\nto this day.\n\nThese aboriginal Swiss lake-dwellers seem to have been succeeded by a\nrace of men using tools, implements, and ornaments of bronze.  In some\nplaces the remains of this bronze period directly overlay those of the\nstone period, showing the latter to have been the most ancient; but in\nothers, the village sites are altogether distinct.  The articles with\nwhich the metal implements are intermixed, show that considerable\nprogress had been made in the useful arts.  The potter's wheel had been\nintroduced.  Agriculture had begun, and wild animals had given place to\ntame ones.  The abundance of bronze also shows that commerce must have\nexisted to a certain extent; for tin, which enters into its\ncomposition, is a comparatively rare metal, and must necessarily have\nbeen imported from other European countries.\n\nThe Swiss antiquarians are of opinion that the men of bronze suddenly\ninvaded and extirpated the men of flint; and that at some still later\nperiod, another stronger and more skilful race, supposed to have been\nCelts from Gaul, came armed with iron weapons, to whom the men of\nbronze succumbed, or with whom, more probably, they gradually\nintermingled.  When iron, or rather steel, came into use, its\nsuperiority in affording a cutting edge was so decisive that it seems\nto have supplanted bronze almost at once;[4] the latter metal\ncontinuing to be employed only for the purpose of making scabbards or\nsword-handles.  Shortly after the commencement of the iron age, the\nlake-habitations were abandoned, the only settlement of this later\nepoch yet discovered being that at Tene, on Lake Neufchatel:  and it is\na remarkable circumstance, showing the great antiquity of the\nlake-dwellings, that they are not mentioned by any of the Roman\nhistorians.\n\nThat iron should have been one of the last of the metals to come into\ngeneral use, is partly accounted for by the circumstance that iron,\nthough one of the most generally diffused of minerals, never presents\nitself in a natural state, except in meteorites; and that to recognise\nits ores, and then to separate the metal from its matrix, demands the\nexercise of no small amount of observation and invention.  Persons\nunacquainted with minerals would be unable to discover the slightest\naffinity between the rough ironstone as brought up from the mine, and\nthe iron or steel of commerce.  To unpractised eyes they would seem to\npossess no properties in common, and it is only after subjecting the\nstone to severe processes of manufacture that usable metal can be\nobtained from it.  The effectual reduction of the ore requires an\nintense heat, maintained by artificial methods, such as furnaces and\nblowing apparatus.[5]  But it is principally in combination with other\nelements that iron is so valuable when compared with other metals.\nThus, when combined with carbon, in varying proportions, substances are\nproduced, so different, but each so valuable, that they might almost be\nregarded in the light of distinct metals,--such, for example, as\ncast-iron, and cast and bar steel; the various qualities of iron\nenabling it to be used for purposes so opposite as a steel pen and a\nrailroad, the needle of a mariner's compass and an Armstrong gun, a\nsurgeon's lancet and a steam engine, the mainspring of a watch and an\niron ship, a pair of scissors and a Nasmyth hammer, a lady's earrings\nand a tubular bridge.\n\nThe variety of purposes to which iron is thus capable of being applied,\nrenders it of more use to mankind than all the other metals combined.\nUnlike iron, gold is found pure, and in an almost workable state; and\nat an early period in history, it seems to have been much more\nplentiful than iron or steel.  But gold was unsuited for the purposes\nof tools, and would serve for neither a saw, a chisel, an axe, nor a\nsword; whilst tempered steel could answer all these purposes.  Hence we\nfind the early warlike nations making the backs of their swords of gold\nor copper, and economizing their steel to form the cutting edge.  This\nis illustrated by many ancient Scandinavian weapons in the museum at\nCopenhagen, which indicate the greatest parsimony in the use of steel\nat a period when both gold and copper appear to have been comparatively\nabundant.\n\nThe knowledge of smelting and working in iron, like most other arts,\ncame from the East.  Iron was especially valued for purposes of war, of\nwhich indeed it was regarded as the symbol, being called \"Mars\" by the\nRomans.[6]  We find frequent mention of it in the Bible.  One of the\nearliest notices of the metal is in connexion with the conquest of\nJudea by the Philistines.  To complete the subjection of the\nIsraelites, their conquerors made captive all the smiths of the land,\nand carried them away.  The Philistines felt that their hold of the\ncountry was insecure so long as the inhabitants possessed the means of\nforging weapons.  Hence \"there was no smith found throughout all the\nland of Israel; for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them\nswords or spears.  But the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to\nsharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and his\nmattock.\" [7]\n\nAt a later period, when Jerusalem was taken by the Babylonians, one of\ntheir first acts was to carry the smiths and other craftsmen captives\nto Babylon.[8]  Deprived of their armourers, the Jews were rendered\ncomparatively powerless.\n\nIt was the knowledge of the art of iron-forging which laid the\nfoundation of the once great empire of the Turks.  Gibbon relates that\nthese people were originally the despised slaves of the powerful Khan\nof the Geougen.  They occupied certain districts of the mountain-ridge\nin the centre of Asia, called Imaus, Caf, and Altai, which yielded iron\nin large quantities.  This metal the Turks were employed by the Khan to\nforge for his use in war.  A bold leader arose among them, who\npersuaded the ironworkers that the arms which they forged for their\nmasters might in their own hands become the instruments of freedom.\nSallying forth from their mountains, they set up their standard, and\ntheir weapons soon freed them.  For centuries after, the Turkish nation\ncontinued to celebrate the event of their liberation by an annual\nceremony, in which a piece of iron was heated in the fire, and a\nsmith's hammer was successively handled by the prince and his nobles.\n\nWe can only conjecture how the art of smelting iron was discovered.\nWho first applied fire to the ore, and made it plastic; who discovered\nfire itself, and its uses in metallurgy? No one can tell.  Tradition\nsays that the metal was discovered through the accidental burning of a\nwood in Greece.  Mr. Mushet thinks it more probable that the discovery\nwas made on the conversion of wood into charcoal for culinary or\nchamber purposes.  \"If a mass of ore,\" he says, \"accidentally dropped\ninto the middle of the burning pile during a period of neglect, or\nduring the existence of a thorough draught, a mixed mass, partly earthy\nand partly metallic, would be obtained, possessing ductility and\nextension under pressure.  But if the conjecture is pushed still\nfurther, and we suppose that the ore was not an oxide, but rich in\niron, magnetic or spicular, the result would in all probability be a\nmass of perfectly malleable iron.  I have seen this fact illustrated in\nthe roasting of a species of iron-stone, which was united with a\nconsiderable mass of bituminous matter.  After a high temperature had\nbeen excited in the interior of the pile, plates of malleable iron of a\ntough and flexible nature were formed, and under circumstances where\nthere was no fuel but that furnished by the ore itself.\" [9]\n\nThe metal once discovered, many attempts would be made to give to that\nwhich had been the effect of accident a more unerring result.  The\nsmelting of ore in an open heap of wood or charcoal being found tedious\nand wasteful, as well as uncertain, would naturally lead to the\ninvention of a furnace; with the object of keeping the ore surrounded\nas much as possible with fuel while the process of conversion into iron\nwas going forward.  The low conical furnaces employed at this day by\nsome of the tribes of Central and Southern Africa, are perhaps very\nmuch the same in character as those adopted by the early tribes of all\ncountries where iron was first made.  Small openings at the lower end\nof the cone to admit the air, and a larger orifice at the top, would,\nwith charcoal, be sufficient to produce the requisite degree of heat\nfor the reduction of the ore.  To this the foot-blast was added, as\nstill used in Ceylon and in India; and afterwards the water-blast, as\nemployed in Spain (where it is known as the Catalan forge), along the\ncoasts of the Mediterranean, and in some parts of America.\n\nIt is worthy of remark, that the ruder the method employed for the\nreduction of the ore, the better the quality of the iron usually is.\nWhere the art is little advanced, only the most tractable ores are\nselected; and as charcoal is the only fuel used, the quality of the\nmetal is almost invariably excellent.  The ore being long exposed to\nthe charcoal fire, and the quantity made small, the result is a metal\nhaving many of the qualities of steel, capable of being used for\nweapons or tools after a comparatively small amount of forging.  Dr.\nLivingstone speaks of the excellent quality of the iron made by the\nAfrican tribes on the Zambesi, who refuse to use ordinary English iron,\nwhich they consider \"rotten.\" [10]  Du Chaillu also says of the Fans,\nthat, in making their best knives and arrow-heads, they will not use\nEuropean or American iron, greatly preferring their own.  The\ncelebrated wootz or steel of India, made in little cakes of only about\ntwo pounds weight, possesses qualities which no European steel can\nsurpass.  Out of this material the famous Damascus sword-blades were\nmade; and its use for so long a period is perhaps one of the most\nstriking proofs of the ancient civilization of India.\n\nThe early history of iron in Britain is necessarily very obscure.  When\nthe Romans invaded the country, the metal seems to have been already\nknown to the tribes along the coast.  The natives had probably smelted\nit themselves in their rude bloomeries, or obtained it from the\nPhoenicians in small quantities in exchange for skins and food, or tin.\nWe must, however, regard the stories told of the ancient British\nchariots armed with swords or scythes as altogether apocryphal.  The\nexistence of iron in sufficient quantity to be used for such a purpose\nis incompatible with contemporary facts, and unsupported by a single\nvestige remaining to our time.  The country was then mostly forest, and\nthe roads did not as yet exist upon which chariots could be used;\nwhilst iron was too scarce to be mounted as scythes upon chariots, when\nthe warriors themselves wanted it for swords.  The orator Cicero, in a\nletter to Trebatius, then serving with the army in Britain,\nsarcastically advised him to capture and convey one of these vehicles\nto Italy for exhibition; but we do not hear that any specimen of the\nBritish war-chariot was ever seen in Rome.\n\nIt is only in the tumuli along the coast, or in those of the\nRomano-British period, that iron implements are ever found; whilst in\nthe ancient burying places of the interior of the country they are\naltogether wanting.  Herodian says of the British pursued by Severus\nthrough the fens and marshes of the east coast, that they wore iron\nhoops round their middles and their necks, esteeming them as ornaments\nand tokens of riches, in like manner as other barbarous people then\nesteemed ornaments of silver and gold.  Their only money, according to\nCaesar, consisted of pieces of brass or iron, reduced to a certain\nstandard weight.[11]  It is particularly important to observe, says M.\nWorsaae, that all the antiquities which have hitherto been found in the\nlarge burying places of the Iron period, in Switzerland, Bavaria,\nBaden, France, England, and the North, exhibit traces more or less of\nRoman influence.[12]  The Romans themselves used weapons of bronze when\nthey could not obtain iron in sufficient quantity, and many of the\nRoman weapons dug out of the ancient tumuli are of that metal.  They\npossessed the art of tempering and hardening bronze to such a degree as\nto enable them to manufacture swords with it of a pretty good edge; and\nin those countries which they penetrated, their bronze implements\ngradually supplanted those which had been previously fashioned of\nstone.  Great quantities of bronze tools have been found in different\nparts of England,--sometimes in heaps, as if they had been thrown away\nin basketfuls as things of little value.  It has been conjectured that\nwhen the Romans came into Britain they found the inhabitants,\nespecially those to the northward, in very nearly the same state as\nCaptain Cook and other voyagers found the inhabitants of the South Sea\nIslands; that the Britons parted with their food and valuables for\ntools of inferior metal made in imitation of their stone ones; but\nfinding themselves cheated by the Romans, as the natives of Otaheite\nhave been cheated by Europeans, the Britons relinquished the bad tools\nwhen they became acquainted with articles made of better metal.[13]\nThe Roman colonists were the first makers of iron in Britain on any\nlarge scale.  They availed themselves of the mineral riches of the\ncountry wherever they went.  Every year brings their extraordinary\nindustrial activity more clearly to light.  They not only occupied the\nbest sites for trade, intersected the land with a complete system of\nwell-constructed roads, studded our hills and valleys with towns,\nvillages, and pleasure-houses, and availed themselves of our medicinal\nsprings for purposes of baths to an extent not even exceeded at this\nday, but they explored our mines and quarries, and carried on the\nsmelting and manufacture of metals in nearly all parts of the island.\nThe heaps of mining refuse left by them in the valleys and along the\nhill-sides of North Derbyshire are still spoken of by the country\npeople as \"old man,\" or the \"old man's work.\"  Year by year, from\nDartmoor to the Moray Firth, the plough turns up fresh traces of their\nindefatigable industry and enterprise, in pigs of lead, implements of\niron and bronze, vessels of pottery, coins, and sculpture; and it is a\nremarkable circumstance that in several districts where the existence\nof extensive iron beds had not been dreamt of until within the last\ntwenty years, as in Northamptonshire and North Yorkshire, the remains\nof ancient workings recently discovered show that the Roman colonists\nwere fully acquainted with them.\n\nBut the principal iron mines worked by that people were those which\nwere most conveniently situated for purposes of exportation, more\nespecially in the southern counties and on the borders of Wales.  The\nextensive cinder heaps found in the--Forest of Dean--which formed the\nreadiest resource of the modern iron-smelter when improved processes\nenabled him to reduce them--show that their principal iron manufactures\nwere carried on in that quarter.[14]  It is indeed matter of history,\nthat about seventeen hundred years since (A.D. 120) the Romans had\nforges in the West of England, both in the Forest of Dean and in South\nWales; and that they sent the metal from thence to Bristol, where it\nwas forged and made into weapons for the use of the troops.  Along the\nbanks of the Wye, the ground is in many places a continuous bed of iron\ncinders, in which numerous remains have been found, furnishing\nunmistakeable proofs of the Roman furnaces.  At the same time, the iron\nores of Sussex were extensively worked, as appears from the cinder\nheaps found at Maresfield and several places in that county, intermixed\nwith Roman pottery, coins, and other remains.  In a bed of scoriae\nseveral acres in extent, at Old Land Farm in Maresfield, the Rev. Mr.\nTurner found the remains of Roman pottery so numerous that scarcely a\nbarrow-load of cinders was removed that did not contain several\nfragments, together with coins of the reigns of Nero, Vespasian, and\nDioclesian.[15]  In the turbulent infancy of nations it is to be\nexpected that we should hear more of the Smith, or worker in iron, in\nconnexion with war, than with more peaceful pursuits.  Although he was\na nail-maker and a horse-shoer--made axes, chisels, saws, and hammers\nfor the artificer--spades and hoes for the farmer--bolts and fastenings\nfor the lord's castle-gates, and chains for his draw-bridge--it was\nprincipally because of his skill in armour-work that he was esteemed.\nHe made and mended the weapons used in the chase and in war--the\ngavelocs, bills, and battle-axes; he tipped the bowmen's arrows, and\nfurnished spear-heads for the men-at-arms; but, above all, he forged\nthe mail-coats and cuirasses of the chiefs, and welded their swords, on\nthe temper and quality of which, life, honour, and victory in battle\ndepended.  Hence the great estimation in which the smith was held in\nthe Anglo-Saxon times.  His person was protected by a double penalty.\nHe was treated as an officer of the highest rank, and awarded the first\nplace in precedency.  After him ranked the maker of mead, and then the\nphysician.  In the royal court of Wales he sat in the great hall with\nthe king and queen, next to the domestic chaplain; and even at that\nearly day there seems to have been a hot spark in the smith's throat\nwhich needed much quenching; for he was \"entitled to a draught of every\nkind of liquor that was brought into the hall.\"\n\nThe smith was thus a mighty man.  The Saxon Chronicle describes the\nvaliant knight himself as a \"mighty war-smith.\"  But the smith was\ngreatest of all in his forging of swords; and the bards were wont to\nsing the praises of the knight's \"good sword\" and of the smith who made\nit, as well as of the knight himself who wielded it in battle.  The\nmost extraordinary powers were attributed to the weapon of steel when\nfirst invented.  Its sharpness seemed so marvellous when compared with\none of bronze, that with the vulgar nothing but magic could account for\nit.  Traditions, enshrined in fairy tales, still survive in most\ncountries, illustrative of its magical properties.  The weapon of\nbronze was dull; but that of steel was bright--the \"white sword of\nlight,\" one touch of which broke spells, liberated enchanted\nprincesses, and froze giants' marrow.  King Arthur's magic sword\n\"Excalibur\" was regarded as almost heroic in the romance of\nchivalry.[16]  So were the swords \"Galatin\" of Sir Gawain, and\n\"Joyeuse\" of Charlemagne, both of which were reputed to be the work of\nWeland the Smith, about whose name clusters so much traditional glory\nas an ancient worker in metals.[17]  The heroes of the Northmen in like\nmanner wielded magic swords.  Olave the Norwegian possessed the sword\n\"Macabuin,\" forged by the dark smith of Drontheim, whose feats are\nrecorded in the tales of the Scalds.  And so, in like manner,\ntraditions of the supernatural power of the blacksmith are found\nexisting to this day all over the Scottish Highlands.[18]  When William\nthe Norman invaded Britain, he was well supplied with smiths.  His\nfollowers were clad in armour of steel, and furnished with the best\nweapons of the time.  Indeed, their superiority in this respect is\nsupposed to have been the principal cause of William's victory over\nHarold; for the men of both armies were equal in point of bravery.  The\nNormans had not only smiths to attend to the arms of the knights, but\nfarriers to shoe their horses.  Henry de Femariis, or Ferrers,\n\"prefectus fabrorum,\" was one of the principal officers entrusted with\nthe supervision of the Conqueror's ferriery department; and long after\nthe earldom was founded his descendants continued to bear on their coat\nof arms the six horse-shoes indicative of their origin.[19]  William\nalso gave the town of Northampton, with the hundred of Fackley, as a\nfief to Simon St.  Liz, in consideration of his providing shoes for his\nhorses.[20]  But though the practice of horse-shoeing is said to have\nbeen introduced to this country at the time of the Conquest, it is\nprobably of an earlier date; as, according to Dugdale, an old Saxon\ntenant in capite of Welbeck in Nottinghamshire, named Gamelbere, held\ntwo carucates of land by the service of shoeing the king's palfrey on\nall four feet with the king's nails, as oft as the king should lie at\nthe neighbouring manor of Mansfield.\n\nAlthough we hear of the smith mostly in connexion with the fabrication\nof instruments of war in the Middle Ages, his importance was no less\nrecognized in the ordinary affairs of rural and industrial life.  He\nwas, as it were, the rivet that held society together.  Nothing could\nbe done without him.  Wherever tools or implements were wanted for\nbuilding, for trade, or for husbandry, his skill was called into\nrequisition.  In remote places he was often the sole mechanic of his\ndistrict; and, besides being a tool-maker, a farrier, and agricultural\nimplement maker, he doctored cattle, drew teeth, practised phlebotomy,\nand sometimes officiated as parish clerk and general newsmonger; for\nthe smithy was the very eye and tongue of the village.  Hence\nShakespeare's picture of the smith in King John:\n\n   \"I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,\n    The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,\n    With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news.\"\n\nThe smith's tools were of many sorts; but the chief were his hammer,\npincers, chisel, tongs, and anvil.  It is astonishing what a variety of\narticles he turned out of his smithy by the help of these rude\nimplements.  In the tooling, chasing, and consummate knowledge of the\ncapabilities of iron, he greatly surpassed the modern workman; for the\nmediaeval blacksmith was an artist as well as a workman.  The numerous\nexquisite specimens of his handicraft which exist in our old gateways,\nchurch doors, altar railings, and ornamented dogs and andirons, still\nserve as types for continual reproduction.  He was, indeed, the most\n\"cunninge workman\" of his time.  But besides all this, he was an\nengineer.  If a road had to be made, or a stream embanked, or a trench\ndug, he was invariably called upon to provide the tools, and often to\ndirect the work.  He was also the military engineer of his day, and as\nlate as the reign of Edward III. we find the king repeatedly sending\nfor smiths from the Forest of Dean to act as engineers for the royal\narmy at the siege of Berwick.\n\nThe smith being thus the earliest and most important of mechanics, it\nwill readily be understood how, at the time when surnames were adopted,\nhis name should have been so common in all European countries.\n\n    \"From whence came Smith, all be he knight or squire,\n     But from the smith that forgeth in the fire?\" [21]\n\nHence the multitudinous family of Smiths in England, in some cases\nvainly disguised under the \"Smythe\" or \"De Smijthe;\" in Germany, the\nSchmidts; in Italy, the Fabri, Fabricii, or Fabbroni; in France, the Le\nFebres or Lefevres; in Scotland, the Gows, Gowans, or Cowans.  We have\nalso among us the Brownsmiths, or makers of brown bills; the Nasmyths,\nor nailsmiths; the Arrowsmiths, or makers of arrowheads; the\nSpearsmiths, or spear makers; the Shoosmiths, or horse shoers; the\nGoldsmiths, or workers in gold; and many more.  The Smith proper was,\nhowever, the worker in iron--the maker of iron tools, implements, and\narms--and hence this name exceeds in number that of all the others\ncombined.\n\nIn course of time the smiths of particular districts began to\ndistinguish themselves for their excellence in particular branches of\niron-work.  From being merely the retainer of some lordly or religious\nestablishment, the smith worked to supply the general demand, and\ngradually became a manufacturer.  Thus the makers of swords, tools,\nbits, and nails, congregated at Birmingham; and the makers of knives\nand arrowheads at Sheffield.  Chaucer speaks of the Miller of\nTrompington as provided with a Sheffield whittle:--\n\n    \"A Shefeld thwytel bare he in his hose.\" [22]\n\n\nThe common English arrowheads manufactured at Sheffield were long\ncelebrated for their excellent temper, as Sheffield iron and steel\nplates are now.  The battle of Hamildon, fought in Scotland in 1402,\nwas won mainly through their excellence.  The historian records that\nthey penetrated the armour of the Earl of Douglas, which had been three\nyears in making; and they were \"so sharp and strong that no armour\ncould repel them.\"  The same arrowheads were found equally efficient\nagainst French armour on the fields of Crecy and Agincourt.\n\nAlthough Scotland is now one of the principal sources from which our\nsupplies of iron are drawn, it was in ancient times greatly distressed\nfor want of the metal.  The people were as yet too little skilled to be\nable to turn their great mineral wealth to account.  Even in the time\nof Wallace, they had scarcely emerged from the Stone period, and were\nunder the necessity of resisting their iron-armed English adversaries\nby means of rude weapons of that material.  To supply themselves with\nswords and spearheads, they imported steel from Flanders, and the rest\nthey obtained by marauding incursions into England.  The district of\nFurness in Lancashire--then as now an iron-producing district--was\nfrequently ravaged with that object; and on such occasions the Scotch\nseized and carried off all the manufactured iron they could find,\npreferring it, though so heavy, to every other kind of plunder.[23]\nAbout the same period, however, iron must have been regarded as almost\na precious metal even in England itself; for we find that in Edward the\nThird's reign, the pots, spits, and frying-pans of the royal kitchen\nwere classed among his Majesty's jewels.[24]\n\nThe same famine of iron prevailed to a still greater extent in the\nHighlands, where it was even more valued, as the clans lived chiefly by\nhunting, and were in an almost constant state of feud.  Hence the smith\nwas a man of indispensable importance among the Highlanders, and the\npossession of a skilful armourer was greatly valued by the chiefs.  The\nstory is told of some delinquency having been committed by a Highland\nsmith, on whom justice must be done; but as the chief could not\ndispense with the smith, he generously offered to hang two weavers in\nhis stead!\n\nAt length a great armourer arose in the Highlands, who was able to\nforge armour that would resist the best Sheffield arrow-heads, and to\nmake swords that would vie with the best weapons of Toledo and Milan.\nThis was the famous Andrea de Ferrara, whose swords still maintain\ntheir ancient reputation.  This workman is supposed to have learnt his\nart in the Italian city after which he was called, and returned to\npractise it in secrecy among the Highland hills.  Before him, no man in\nGreat Britain is said to have known how to temper a sword in such a way\nas to bend so that the point should touch the hilt and spring back\nuninjured.  The swords of Andrea de Ferrara did this, and were\naccordingly in great request; for it was of every importance to the\nwarrior that his weapon should be strong and sharp without being\nunwieldy, and that it should not be liable to snap in the act of\ncombat.  This celebrated smith, whose personal identity[25] has become\nmerged in the Andrea de Ferrara swords of his manufacture, pursued his\ncraft in the Highlands, where he employed a number of skilled workmen\nin forging weapons, devoting his own time principally to giving them\ntheir required temper.  He is said to have worked in a dark cellar, the\nbetter to enable him to perceive the effect of the heat upon the metal,\nand to watch the nicety of the operation of tempering, as well as\npossibly to serve as a screen to his secret method of working.[26]\nLong after Andrea de Ferrara's time, the Scotch swords were famous for\ntheir temper; Judge Marshal Fatten, who accompanied the Protector's\nexpedition into Scotland in 1547, observing that \"the Scots came with\nswords all broad and thin, of exceeding good temper, and universally so\nmade to slice that I never saw none so good, so I think it hard to\ndevise a better.\"  The quality of the steel used for weapons of war was\nindeed of no less importance for the effectual defence of a country\nthen than it is now.  The courage of the attacking and defending forces\nbeing equal, the victory would necessarily rest with the party in\npossession of the best weapons.\n\nEngland herself has on more than one occasion been supposed to be in\nserious peril because of the decay of her iron manufactures.  Before\nthe Spanish Armada, the production of iron had been greatly discouraged\nbecause of the destruction of timber in the smelting of the ore--the\nart of reducing it with pit coal not having yet been invented; and we\nwere consequently mainly dependent upon foreign countries for our\nsupplies of the material out of which arms were made.  The best iron\ncame from Spain itself, then the most powerful nation in Europe, and as\ncelebrated for the excellence of its weapons as for the discipline and\nvalour of its troops.  The Spaniards prided themselves upon the\nsuperiority of their iron, and regarded its scarcity in England as an\nimportant element in their calculations of the conquest of the country\nby their famous Armada.  \"I have heard,\" says Harrison, \"that when one\nof the greatest peers of Spain espied our nakedness in this behalf, and\ndid solemnly utter in no obscure place, that it would be an easy matter\nin short time to conquer England because it wanted armour, his words\nwere not so rashly uttered as politely noted.\"  The vigour of Queen\nElizabeth promptly supplied a remedy by the large importations of iron\nwhich she caused to be made, principally from Sweden, as well as by the\nincreased activity of the forges in Sussex and the Forest of Dean;\n\"whereby,\" adds Harrison, \"England obtained rest, that otherwise might\nhave been sure of sharp and cruel wars.  Thus a Spanish word uttered by\none man at one time, overthrew, or at the leastwise hindered sundry\nprivy practices of many at another.\" [27]  Nor has the subject which\noccupied the earnest attention of politicians in Queen Elizabeth's time\nceased to be of interest; for, after the lapse of nearly three hundred\nyears, we find the smith and the iron manufacturer still uppermost in\npublic discussions.  It has of late years been felt that our\nmuch-prized \"hearts of oak\" are no more able to stand against the prows\nof mail which were supposed to threaten them, than the sticks and\nstones of the ancient tribes were able to resist the men armed with\nweapons of bronze or steel.  What Solon said to Croesus, when the\nlatter was displaying his great treasures of gold, still holds\ntrue:--\"If another comes that hath better iron than you, he will be\nmaster of all that gold.\"  So, when an alchemist waited upon the Duke\nof Brunswick during the Seven Years' War, and offered to communicate\nthe secret of converting iron into gold, the Duke replied:--\"By no\nmeans:  I want all the iron I can find to resist my enemies:  as for\ngold, I get it from England.\" Thus the strength and wealth of nations\ndepend upon coal and iron, not forgetting Men, far more than upon gold.\n\nThanks to our Armstrongs and Whitworths, our Browns and our Smiths, the\niron defences of England, manned by our soldiers and our sailors,\nfurnish the assurance of continued security for our gold and our\nwealth, and, what is infinitely more precious, for our industry and our\nliberty.\n\n\n\n[1] \"Mr. John Buchanan, a zealous antiquary, writing in 1855, informs\nus that in the course of the eight years preceding that date, no less\nthan seventeen canoes had been dug out of this estuarine silt [of the\nvalley of the Clyde], and that he had personally inspected a large\nnumber of them before they were exhumed.  Five of them lay buried in\nsilt under the streets of Glasgow, one in a vertical position with the\nprow uppermost, as if it had sunk in a storm....  Almost every one of\nthese ancient boats was formed out of a single oak-stem, hollowed out\nby blunt tools, probably stone axes, aided by the action of fire; a few\nwere cut beautifully smooth, evidently with metallic tools.  Hence a\ngradation could be traced from a pattern of extreme rudeness to one\nshowing great mechanical ingenuity....  In one of the canoes a\nbeautifully polished celt or axe of greenstone was found; in the bottom\nof another a plug of cork, which, as Mr. Geikie remarks, 'could only\nhave come from the latitudes of Spain, Southern France, or\nItaly.'\"--Sir C.

Worsaae's classification.\n\n[4] Mr. Mushet, however, observes that \"the general use of hardened\ncopper by the ancients for edge-tools and warlike instruments, does not\npreclude the supposition that iron was then comparatively plentiful,\nthough it is probable that it was confined to the ruder arts of life.\nA knowledge of the mixture of copper, tin, and zinc, seems to have been\namong the first discoveries of the metallurgist.  Instruments\nfabricated from these alloys, recommended by the use of ages, the\nperfection of the art, the splendour and polish of their surfaces, not\neasily injured by time and weather, would not soon be superseded by the\ninvention of simple iron, inferior in edge and polish, at all times\neasily injured by rust, and in the early stages of its manufacture\nconverted with difficulty into forms that required proportion or\nelegance.\"--(Papers on Iron and Steel, 365-6.) By some secret method\nthat has been lost, perhaps because no longer needed since the\ninvention of steel, the ancients manufactured bronze tools capable of\ntaking a fine edge.  In our own time, Chantrey the sculptor, in his\nreverence for classic metallurgy, had a bronze razor made with which he\nmartyred himself in shaving; but none were found so hardy and devoted\nas to follow his example.\n\n[5] It may be mentioned in passing, that while Zinc is fusible at 3\ndegrees of Wedgwood's pyrometer, Silver at 22 degrees, Copper at 27\ndegrees, and Gold at 32 degrees, Cast Iron is only fusible at 130\ndegrees.  Tin (one of the constituents of the ancient bronze) and Lead\nare fusible at much lower degrees than zinc.\n\n[6] The Romans named the other metals after the gods.  Thus Quicksilver\nwas called Mercury, Lead Saturn, Tin Jupiter, Copper Venus, Silver\nLuna, and so on; and our own language has received a colouring from the\nRoman nomenclature, which it continues to retain.\n\n[7] I.

Iron was also the currency of the Spartans,\nbut it has been used as such in much more recent times.  Adam Smith, in\nhis Wealth of Nations (Book I. ch. 4, published in 1776), says, \"there\nis at this day a village in Scotland where it is not uncommon, I am\ntold, for a workman to carry nails, instead of money, to the baker's\nshop or the alehouse.\"\n\n[12] Primeval Antiquities of Denmark.

It was the image of\nMars, and sacrifices were made to it.  \"An iron sword,\" says Mr.\nCampbell, \"really was once worshipped by a people with whom iron was\nrare.  Iron is rare, while stone and bronze weapons are common, in\nBritish tombs, and the sword of these stories is a personage.  It\nshines, it cries out--the lives of men are bound up in it.  And so this\nmystic sword may, perhaps, have been a god amongst the Celts, or the\ngod of the people with whom the Celts contended somewhere on their long\njourney to the west.  It is a fiction now, but it may be founded on\nfact, and that fact probably was the first use of iron.\" To this day an\nold horse-shoe is considered a potent spell in some districts against\nthe powers of evil; and for want of a horse-shoe a bit of a rusty\nreaping-hook is supposed to have equal power, \"Who were these powers of\nevil who could not resist iron--these fairies who shoot STONE arrows,\nand are of the foes to the human race?

Such a heate issueth out of\nthe many forges and furnaces for the making of iron, and out of the\nglasse kilnes, as hath devoured many famous woods within the\nwelds,\"--JOHN NORDEN, Surveyors' Dialogue (1607).\n\n\nFew records exist of the manufacture of iron in England in early times.\nAfter the Romans left the island, the British, or more probably the\nTeutonic tribes settled along the south coast, continued the smelting\nand manufacture of the metal after the methods taught them by the\ncolonists.  In the midst of the insecurity, however, engendered by\ncivil war and social changes, the pursuits of industry must necessarily\nhave been considerably interfered with, and the art of iron-forging\nbecame neglected.  No notice of iron being made in Sussex occurs in\nDomesday Book, from which it would appear that the manufacture had in a\ngreat measure ceased in that county at the time of the Conquest, though\nit was continued in the iron-producing districts bordering on Wales.\nIn many of the Anglo-Saxon graves which have been opened, long iron\nswords have been found, showing that weapons of that metal were in\ncommon use.  But it is probable that iron was still scarce, as ploughs\nand other agricultural implements continued to be made of wood,--one of\nthe Anglo-Saxon laws enacting that no man should undertake to guide a\nplough who could not make one; and that the cords with which it was\nbound should be of twisted willows.  The metal was held in esteem\nprincipally as the material of war.  All male adults were required to\nbe provided with weapons, and honour was awarded to such artificers as\nexcelled in the fabrication of swords, arms, and defensive armour.[1]\n\nCamden incidentally states that the manufacture of iron was continued\nin the western counties during the Saxon era, more particularly in the\nForest of Dean, and that in the time of Edward the Confessor the\ntribute paid by the city of Gloucester consisted almost entirely of\niron rods wrought to a size fit for making nails for the king's ships.\nAn old religious writer speaks of the ironworkers of that day as\nheathenish in their manners, puffed up with pride, and inflated with\nworldly prosperity.  On the occasion of St.  Egwin's visit to the\nsmiths of Alcester, as we are told in the legend, he found then given\nup to every kind of luxury; and when he proceeded to preach unto them,\nthey beat upon their anvils in contempt of his doctrine so as\ncompletely to deafen him; upon which he addressed his prayers to\nheaven, and the town was immediately destroyed.[2]\n\nBut the first reception given to John Wesley by the miners of the\nForest of Dean, more than a thousand years later, was perhaps scarcely\nmore gratifying than that given to St.  Egwin.\n\nThat working in iron was regarded as an honourable and useful calling\nin the Middle Ages, is apparent from the extent to which it was\nfollowed by the monks, some of whom were excellent craftsmen.  Thus St.\nDunstan, who governed England in the time of Edwy the Fair, was a\nskilled blacksmith and metallurgist.  He is said to have had a forge\neven in his bedroom, and it was there that his reputed encounter with\nSatan occurred, in which of course the saint came off the victor.\n\nThere was another monk of St.  Alban's, called Anketil, who flourished\nin the twelfth century, so famous for his skill as a worker in iron,\nsilver, gold, jewelry, and gilding, that he was invited by the king of\nDenmark to be his goldsmith and banker.  A pair of gold and silver\ncandlesticks of his manufacture, presented by the abbot of St.  Alban's\nto Pope Adrian IV., were so much esteemed for their exquisite\nworkmanship that they were consecrated to St.  Peter, and were the\nmeans of obtaining high ecclesiastical distinction for the abbey.\n\nWe also find that the abbots of monasteries situated in the iron\ndistricts, among their other labours, devoted themselves to the\nmanufacture of iron from the ore.  The extensive beds of cinders still\nfound in the immediate neighbourhood of Rievaulx and Hackness, in\nYorkshire, show that the monks were well acquainted with the art of\nforging, and early turned to account the riches of the Cleveland\nironstone.  In the Forest of Dean also, the abbot of Flaxley was\npossessed of one stationary and one itinerant forge, by grant from\nHenry II, and he was allowed two oaks weekly for fuel,--a privilege\nafterwards commuted, in 1258, for Abbot's Wood of 872 acres, which was\nheld by the abbey until its dissolution in the reign of Henry VIII.  At\nthe same time the Earl of Warwick had forges at work in his woods at\nLydney; and in 1282, as many as 72 forges were leased from the Crown by\nvarious iron-smelters in the same Forest of Dean.\n\nThere are numerous indications of iron-smelting having been conducted\non a considerable scale at some remote period in the neighbourhood of\nLeeds, in Yorkshire.  In digging out the foundations of houses in\nBriggate, the principal street of that town, many \"bell pits\" have been\nbrought to light, from which ironstone has been removed.  The new\ncemetery at Burmandtofts, in the same town, was in like manner found\npitted over with these ancient holes.  The miner seems to have dug a\nwell about 6 feet in diameter, and so soon as he reached the mineral,\nhe worked it away all round, leaving the bell-shaped cavities in\nquestion.  He did not attempt any gallery excavations, but when the pit\nwas exhausted, a fresh one was sunk.  The ore, when dug, was\ntransported, most probably on horses' backs, to the adjacent districts\nfor the convenience of fuel.  For it was easier to carry the mineral to\nthe wood--then exclusively used for smelting'--than to bring the wood\nto the mineral.  Hence the numerous heaps of scoriae found in the\nneighbourhood of Leeds,--at Middleton, Whitkirk, and Horsforth--all\nwithin the borough.  At Horsforth, they are found in conglomerated\nmasses from 30 to 40 yards long, and of considerable width and depth.\nThe remains of these cinder-beds in various positions, some of them\nnear the summit of the hill, tend to show, that as the trees were\nconsumed, a new wind furnace was erected in another situation, in order\nto lessen the labour of carrying the fuel.  There are also deposits of\na similar kind at Kirkby Overblow, a village a few miles to the\nnorth-east of Leeds; and Thoresby states that the place was so called\nbecause it was the village of the \"Ore blowers,\"--hence the corruption\nof \"Overblow.\"  A discovery has recently been made among the papers of\nthe Wentworth family, of a contract for supplying wood and ore for iron\n\"blomes\" at Kirskill near Otley, in the fourteenth century;[3] though\nthe manufacture near that place has long since ceased.\n\nAlthough the making of iron was thus carried on in various parts of\nEngland in the Middle Ages, the quantity produced was altogether\ninsufficient to meet the ordinary demand, as it appears from our early\nrecords to have long continued one of the principal articles imported\nfrom foreign countries.  English iron was not only dearer, but it was\nmuch inferior in quality to that manufactured abroad; and hence all the\nbest arms and tools continued to be made of foreign iron.  Indeed the\nscarcity of this metal occasionally led to great inconvenience, and to\nprevent its rising in price Parliament enacted, in 1354, that no iron,\neither wrought or unwrought, should be exported, under heavy penalties.\nFor nearly two hundred years--that is, throughout the fourteenth and\nfifteenth centuries--the English market was principally supplied with\niron and steel from Spain and Germany; the foreign merchants of the\nSteelyard doing a large and profitable trade in those commodities.\nWhile the woollen and other branches of trade were making considerable\nprogress, the manufacture of iron stood still.  Among the lists of\narticles, the importation of which was prohibited in Edward IV.'s\nreign, with a view to the protection of domestic manufactures, we find\nno mention of iron, which was still, as a matter of necessity, allowed\nto come freely from abroad.\n\nThe first indications of revival in the iron manufacture showed\nthemselves in Sussex, a district in which the Romans had established\nextensive works, and where smelting operations were carried on to a\npartial extent in the neighbourhood of Lewes, in the thirteenth and\nfourteenth centuries, where the iron was principally made into nails\nand horse-shoes.  The county abounds in ironstone, which is contained\nin the sandstone beds of the Forest ridge, lying between the chalk and\noolite of the district, called by geologists the Hastings sand.  The\nbeds run in a north-westerly direction, by Ashburnham and Heathfield,\nto Crowborough and thereabouts.  In early times the region was covered\nwith wood, and was known as the Great Forest of Anderida.  The Weald,\nor wild wood, abounded in oaks of great size, suitable for smelting\nore; and the proximity of the mineral to the timber, as well as the\nsituation of the district in the neighbourhood of the capital,\nsufficiently account for the Sussex iron-works being among the most\nimportant which existed in England previous to the discovery of\nsmelting by pit-coal.\n\nThe iron manufacturers of the south were especially busy during the\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries.  Their works were established near\nto the beds of ore, and in places where water-power existed, or could\nbe provided by artificial means.  Hence the numerous artificial ponds\nwhich are still to be found all over the Sussex iron district.  Dams of\nearth, called \"pond-bays,\" were thrown across watercourses, with\nconvenient outlets built of masonry, wherein was set the great wheel\nwhich worked the hammer or blew the furnace.  Portions of the adjoining\nforest-land were granted or leased to the iron-smelters; and the many\nplaces still known by the name of \"Chart\" in the Weald, probably mark\nthe lands chartered for the purpose of supplying the iron-works with\ntheir necessary fuel.  The cast-iron tombstones and slabs in many\nSussex churchyards,--the andirons and chimney backs[4] still found in\nold Sussex mansions and farm-houses, and such names as Furnace Place,\nCinder Hill, Forge Farm, and Hammer Pond, which are of very frequent\noccurrence throughout the county, clearly mark the extent and activity\nof this ancient branch of industry.[5]  Steel was also manufactured at\nseveral places in the county, more particularly at Steel-Forge Land,\nWarbleton, and at Robertsbridge.  The steel was said to be of good\nquality, resembling Swedish--both alike depending for their excellence\non the exclusive use of charcoal in smelting the ore,--iron so produced\nmaintaining its superiority over coal-smelted iron to this day.\n\nWhen cannon came to be employed in war, the nearness of Sussex to\nLondon and the Cinque Forts gave it a great advantage over the remoter\niron-producing districts in the north and west of England, and for a\nlong time the iron-works of this county enjoyed almost a monopoly of\nthe manufacture.  The metal was still too precious to be used for\ncannon balls, which were hewn of stone from quarries on Maidstone\nHeath.  Iron was only available, and that in limited quantities, for\nthe fabrication of the cannon themselves, and wrought-iron was chiefly\nused for the purpose.  An old mortar which formerly lay on Eridge\nGreen, near Frant, is said to have been the first mortar made in\nEngland;[6] only the chamber was cast, while the tube consisted of bars\nstrongly hooped together.  Although the local distich says that\n\n  \"Master Huggett and his man John\n  They did cast the first cannon,\"\n\nthere is every reason to believe that both cannons and mortars were\nmade in Sussex before Huggett's time; the old hooped guns in the Tower\nbeing of the date of Henry VI.  The first cast-iron cannons of English\nmanufacture were made at Buxtead, in Sussex, in 1543, by Ralph Hogge,\nmaster founder, who employed as his principal assistant one Peter\nBaude, a Frenchman.  Gun-founding was a French invention, and Mr. Lower\nsupposes that Hogge brought over Baude from France to teach his workmen\nthe method of casting the guns.  About the same time Hogge employed a\nskilled Flemish gunsmith named Peter Van Collet, who, according to\nStowe, \"devised or caused to be made certain mortar pieces, being at\nthe mouth from eleven to nine inches wide, for the use whereof the said\nPeter caused to be made certain hollow shot of cast-iron to be stuffed\nwith fyrework, whereof the bigger sort for the same has screws of iron\nto receive a match to carry fyre for to break in small pieces the said\nhollow shot, whereof the smallest piece hitting a man would kill or\nspoil him.\"  In short, Peter Van Collet here introduced the manufacture\nof the explosive shell in the form in which it continued to be used\ndown to our own day.\n\nBaude, the Frenchman, afterwards set up business on his own account,\nmaking many guns, both of brass and iron, some of which are still\npreserved in the Tower.[7]  Other workmen, learning the trade from him,\nalso began to manufacture on their own account; one of Baude's\nservants, named John Johnson, and after him his son Thomas, becoming\nfamous for the excellence of their cast-iron guns.  The Hogges\ncontinued the business for several generations, and became a wealthy\ncounty family.  Huggett was another cannon maker of repute; and Owen\nbecame celebrated for his brass culverins.  Mr. Lower mentions, as a\ncurious instance of the tenacity with which families continue to follow\na particular vocation, that many persons of the name of Huggett still\ncarry on the trade of blacksmith in East Sussex.  But most of the early\nworkmen at the Sussex iron-works, as in other branches of skilled\nindustry in England during the sixteenth century, were\nforeigners--Flemish and French--many of whom had taken refuge in this\ncountry from the religious persecutions then raging abroad, while\nothers, of special skill, were invited over by the iron manufacturers\nto instruct their workmen in the art of metal-founding.[8]\n\nAs much wealth was gained by the pursuit of the revived iron\nmanufacture in Sussex, iron-mills rapidly extended over the\nore-yielding district.  The landed proprietors entered with zeal into\nthis new branch of industry, and when wood ran short, they did not\nhesitate to sacrifice their ancestral oaks to provide fuel for the\nfurnaces.  Mr. Lower says even the most ancient families, such as the\nNevilles, Howards, Percys, Stanleys, Montagues, Pelhams, Ashburnhams,\nSidneys, Sackvilles, Dacres, and Finches, prosecuted the manufacture\nwith all the apparent ardour of Birmingham and Wolverhampton men in\nmodern times.  William Penn, the courtier Quaker, had iron-furnaces at\nHawkhurst and other places in Sussex.  The ruins of the Ashburnham\nforge, situated a few miles to the north-east of Battle, still serve to\nindicate the extent of the manufacture.  At the upper part of the\nvalley in which the works were situated, an artificial lake was formed\nby constructing an embankment across the watercourse descending from\nthe higher ground,[9] and thus a sufficient fall of water was procured\nfor the purpose of blowing the furnaces, the site of which is still\nmarked by surrounding mounds of iron cinders and charcoal waste.  Three\nquarters of a mile lower down the valley stood the forge, also provided\nwith water-power for working the hammer; and some of the old buildings\nare still standing, among others the boring-house, of small size, now\nused as an ordinary labourer's cottage, where the guns were bored.  The\nmachine was a mere upright drill worked by the water-wheel, which was\nonly eighteen inches across the breast.  The property belonged, as it\nstill does, to the Ashburnham family, who are said to have derived\ngreat wealth from the manufacture of guns at their works, which were\namong the last carried on in Sussex.  The Ashburnham iron was\ndistinguished for its toughness, and was said to be equal to the best\nSpanish or Swedish iron.\n\nMany new men also became enriched, and founded county families; the\nFuller family frankly avowing their origin in the singular motto of\nCarbone et forcipibus--literally, by charcoal and tongs.[10]\n\nMen then went into Sussex to push their fortunes at the forges, as they\nnow do in Wales or Staffordshire; and they succeeded then, as they do\nnow, by dint of application, industry, and energy.  The Sussex\nArchaeological Papers for 1860 contain a curious record of such an\nadventurer, in the history of the founder of the Gale family.  Leonard\nGale was born in 1620 at Riverhead, near Sevenoaks, where his father\npursued the trade of a blacksmith.  When the youth had reached his\nseventeenth year, his father and mother, with five of their sons and\ndaughters, died of the plague, Leonard and his brother being the only\nmembers of the family that survived.  The patrimony of 200L. left them\nwas soon spent; after which Leonard paid off his servants, and took to\nwork diligently at his father's trade.  Saving a little money, he\ndetermined to go down into Sussex, where we shortly find him working\nthe St.  Leonard's Forge, and afterwards the Tensley Forge near\nCrawley, and the Cowden Iron-works, which then bore a high reputation.\nAfter forty years' labour, he accumulated a good fortune, which he left\nto his son of the same name, who went on iron-forging, and eventually\nbecame a county gentleman, owner of the house and estate of Crabbett\nnear Worth, and Member of Parliament for East Grinstead.\n\nSeveral of the new families, however, after occupying a high position\nin the county, again subsided into the labouring class, illustrating\nthe Lancashire proverb of \"Twice clogs, once boots,\" the sons\nsquandering what the father's had gathered, and falling back into the\nranks again.  Thus the great Fowles family of Riverhall disappeared\naltogether from Sussex.  One of them built the fine mansion of\nRiverhall, noble even in decay.  Another had a grant of free warren\nfrom King James over his estates in Wadhurst, Frant, Rotherfield, and\nMayfield.  Mr. Lower says the fourth in descent from this person kept\nthe turnpike-gate at Wadhurst, and that the last of the family, a\nday-labourer, emigrated to America in 1839, carrying with him, as the\nsole relic of his family greatness, the royal grant of free warren\ngiven to his ancestor.  The Barhams and Mansers were also great\niron-men, officiating as high sheriffs of the county at different\ntimes, and occupying spacious mansions.  One branch of these families\nterminated, Mr. Lower says, with Nicholas Barham, who died in the\nworkhouse at Wadhurst in 1788; and another continues to be represented\nby a wheelwright at Wadhurst of the same name.\n\nThe iron manufacture of Sussex reached its height towards the close of\nthe reign of Elizabeth, when the trade became so prosperous that,\ninstead of importing iron, England began to export it in considerable\nquantities, in the shape of iron ordnance.  Sir Thomas Leighton and Sir\nHenry Neville had obtained patents from the queen, which enabled them\nto send their ordnance abroad, the consequence of which was that the\nSpaniards were found arming their ships and fighting us with guns of\nour own manufacture.  Sir Walter Raleigh, calling attention to the\nsubject in the House of Commons, said, \"I am sure heretofore one ship\nof Her Majesty's was able to beat ten Spaniards, but now, by reason of\nour own ordnance, we are hardly matcht one to one.\"  Proclamations were\nissued forbidding the export of iron and brass ordnance, and a bill was\nbrought into Parliament to put a stop to the trade; but, not\nwithstanding these prohibitions, the Sussex guns long continued to be\nsmuggled out of the country in considerable numbers.  \"It is almost\nincredible,\" says Camden, \"how many guns are made of the iron in this\ncounty.  Count Gondomar (the Spanish ambassador) well knew their\ngoodness when he so often begged of King James the boon to export\nthem.\"  Though the king refused his sanction, it appears that Sir\nAnthony Shirley of Weston, an extensive iron-master, succeeded in\nforwarding to the King of Spain a hundred pieces of cannon.\n\nSo active were the Sussex manufacturers, and so brisk was the trade\nthey carried on, that during the reign of James I.  it is supposed\none-half of the whole quantity of iron produced in England was made\nthere.  Simon Sturtevant, in his 'Treatise of Metallica,' published in\n1612, estimates the whole number of iron-mills in England and Wales at\n800, of which, he says, \"there are foure hundred milnes in Surry, Kent,\nand Sussex, as the townsmen of Haslemere have testified and numbered\nunto me.\"  But the townsmen of Haslemere must certainly have been\nexaggerating, unless they counted smiths' and farriers' shops in the\nnumber of iron-mills.  About the same time that Sturtevant's treatise\nwas published, there appeared a treatise entitled the 'Surveyor's\nDialogue,' by one John Norden, the object of which was to make out a\ncase against the iron-works and their being allowed to burn up the\ntimber of the country for fuel.  Yet Norden does not make the number of\niron-works much more than a third of Sturtevant's estimate.  He says,\n\"I have heard that there are or lately were in Sussex neere 140 hammers\nand furnaces for iron, and in it and Surrey adjoining three or four\nglasse-houses.\"  Even the smaller number stated by Norden, however,\nshows that Sussex was then regarded as the principal seat of the\niron-trade.  Camden vividly describes the noise and bustle of the\nmanufacture--the working of the heavy hammers, which, \"beating upon the\niron, fill the neighbourhood round about, day and night, with continual\nnoise.\"  These hammers were for the most part worked by the power of\nwater, carefully stored in the artificial \"Hammer-ponds\" above\ndescribed.  The hammer-shaft was usually of ash, about 9 feet long,\nclamped at intervals with iron hoops.  It was worked by the revolutions\nof the water-wheel, furnished with projecting arms or knobs to raise\nthe hammer, which fell as each knob passed, the rapidity of its action\nof course depending on the velocity with which the water-wheel\nrevolved.  The forge-blast was also worked for the most part by\nwater-power.  Where the furnaces were small, the blast was produced by\nleather bellows worked by hand, or by a horse walking in a gin.  The\nfoot-blasts of the earlier iron-smelters were so imperfect that but a\nsmall proportion of the ore was reduced, so that the iron-makers of\nlater times, more particularly in the Forest of Dean, instead of\ndigging for ironstone, resorted to the beds of ancient scoriae for\ntheir principal supply of the mineral.\n\nNotwithstanding the large number of furnaces in blast throughout the\ncounty of Sussex at the period we refer to, their produce was\ncomparatively small, and must not be measured by the enormous produce\nof modern iron-works; for while an iron-furnace of the present day will\neasily turn out 150 tons of pig per week, the best of the older\nfurnaces did not produce more than from three to four tons.  One of the\nlast extensive contracts executed in Sussex was the casting of the iron\nrails which enclose St.  Paul's Cathedral.  The contract was thought\ntoo large for one iron-master to undertake, and it was consequently\ndistributed amongst several contractors, though the principal part of\nthe work was executed at Lamberhurst, near Tunbridge Wells.  But to\nproduce the comparatively small quantity of iron turned out by the old\nworks, the consumption of timber was enormous; for the making of every\nton of pig-iron required four loads of timber converted into charcoal\nfuel, and the making of every ton of bar-iron required three additional\nloads.  Thus, notwithstanding the indispensable need of iron, the\nextension of the manufacture, by threatening the destruction of the\ntimber of the southern counties, came to be regarded in the light of a\nnational calamity.  Up to a certain point, the clearing of the Weald of\nits dense growth of underwood had been of advantage, by affording\nbetter opportunities for the operations of agriculture.  But the\n\"voragious iron-mills\" were proceeding to swallow up everything that\nwould burn, and the old forest growths were rapidly disappearing.  An\nentire wood was soon exhausted, and long time was needed before it grew\nagain.  At Lamberhurst alone, though the produce was only about five\ntons of iron a-week, the annual consumption of wood was about 200,000\ncords!  Wood continued to be the only material used for fuel\ngenerally--a strong prejudice existing against the use of sea-coal for\ndomestic purposes.[11]  It therefore began to be feared that there\nwould be no available fuel left within practicable reach of the\nmetropolis; and the contingency of having to face the rigorous cold of\nan English winter without fuel naturally occasioning much alarm, the\naction of the Government was deemed necessary to remedy the apprehended\nevil.\n\nTo check the destruction of wood near London, an Act was passed in 1581\nprohibiting its conversion into fuel for the making of iron within\nfourteen miles of the Thames, forbidding the erection of new ironworks\nwithin twenty-two miles of London, and restricting the number of works\nin Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, beyond the above limits.  Similar\nenactments were made in future Parliaments with the same object, which\nhad the effect of checking the trade, and several of the Sussex\nironmasters were under the necessity of removing their works elsewhere.\nSome of them migrated to Glamorganshire, in South Wales, because of the\nabundance of timber as well as ironstone in that quarter, and there set\nup their forges, more particularly at Aberdare and Merthyr Tydvil.  Mr.\nLlewellin has recently published an interesting account of their\nproceedings, with descriptions of their works,[12] remains of which\nstill exist at Llwydcoed, Pontyryns, and other places in the Aberdare\nvalley.  Among the Sussex masters who settled in Glamorganshire for the\npurpose of carrying on the iron manufacture, were Walter Burrell, the\nfriend of John Ray, the naturalist, one of the Morleys of Glynde in\nSussex, the Relfes from Mayfield, and the Cheneys from Crawley.\n\nNotwithstanding these migrations of enterprising manufacturers, the\niron trade of Sussex continued to exist until the middle of the\nseventeenth century, when the waste of timber was again urged upon the\nattention of Parliament, and the penalties for infringing the statutes\nseem to have been more rigorously enforced.  The trade then suffered a\nmore serious check; and during the civil wars, a heavy blow was given\nto it by the destruction of the works belonging to all royalists, which\nwas accomplished by a division of the army under Sir William Waller.\nMost of the Welsh ironworks were razed to the ground about the same\ntime, and were not again rebuilt.  And after the Restoration, in 1674,\nall the royal ironworks in the Forest of Dean were demolished, leaving\nonly such to be supplied with ore as were beyond the forest limits; the\nreason alleged for this measure being lest the iron manufacture should\nendanger the supply of timber required for shipbuilding and other\nnecessary purposes.\n\nFrom this time the iron manufacture of Sussex, as of England generally,\nrapidly declined.  In 1740 there were only fifty-nine furnaces in all\nEngland, of which ten were in Sussex; and in 1788 there were only two.\nA few years later, and the Sussex iron furnaces were blown out\naltogether.  Farnhurst, in western, and Ashburnham, in eastern Sussex,\nwitnessed the total extinction of the manufacture.  The din of the iron\nhammer was hushed, the glare of the furnace faded, the last blast of\nthe bellows was blown, and the district returned to its original rural\nsolitude.  Some of the furnace-ponds were drained and planted with hops\nor willows; others formed beautiful lakes in retired pleasure-grounds;\nwhile the remainder were used to drive flour-mills, as the streams in\nNorth Kent, instead of driving fulling-mills, were employed to work\npaper-mills.  All that now remains of the old iron-works are the\nextensive beds of cinders from which material is occasionally taken to\nmend the Sussex roads, and the numerous furnace-ponds, hammer-posts,\nforges, and cinder places, which mark the seats of the ancient\nmanufacture.\n\n\n\n[1] WILKINS, Leges Sax. 25.\n\n[2] Life of St. Egwin, in Capgrave's Nova Legenda Anglioe.

It is still a seat of the needle\nmanufacture.\n\n[3] The following is an extract of this curious document, which is\ndated the 26th Dec. 1352:  \"Ceste endenture fait entre monsire Richard\nde Goldesburghe, chivaler, dune part, et Robert Totte, seignour, dautre\ntesmoigne qe le dit monsire Richard ad graunte et lesse al dit Robert\ndeuz Olyveres contenaunz vynt quatre blomes de la feste seynt Piere ad\nvincula lan du regne le Roi Edward tierce apres le conqueste vynt\nsysme, en sun parke de Creskelde, rendant al dit monsire Richard\nchesqune semayn quatorzse soutz dargent duraunt les deux Olyvers avaunt\ndist; a tenir et avoir al avaunt dit Robert del avaunt dit monsire\nRichard de la feste seynt Piere avaunt dist, taunque le bois soit ars\ndu dit parke a la volunte le dit monsire Richard saunz interrupcione [e\nle dicte monsieur Richard trovera a dit Robert urre suffisaunt pur lez\nditz Olyvers pur le son donaunt:  these words are interlined].

New furnaces ceased to be erected, and many of the old\nones were allowed to fall into decay, until it began to be feared that\nthis important branch of industry would become completely lost.  The\nsame restrictions alike affected the operations of the glass\nmanufacture, which, with the aid of foreign artisans, had been\ngradually established in England, and was becoming a thriving branch of\ntrade.  It was even proposed that the smelting of iron should be\nabsolutely prohibited:  \"many think,\" said a contemporary writer, \"that\nthere should be NO WORKS ANYWHERE--they do so devour the woods.\"\n\nThe use of iron, however, could not be dispensed with.  The very\nfoundations of society rested upon an abundant supply of it, for tools\nand implements of peace, as well as for weapons of war.  In the dearth\nof the article at home, a supply of it was therefore sought for abroad;\nand both iron and steel came to be imported in largely-increased\nquantities.  This branch of trade was principally in the hands of the\nSteelyard Company of Foreign Merchants, established in Upper Thames\nStreet, a little above London Bridge; and they imported large\nquantities of iron and steel from foreign countries, principally from\nSweden, Germany, and Spain.  The best iron came from Spain, though the\nSpaniards on their part coveted our English made cannons, which were\nbetter manufactured than theirs; while the best steel came from Germany\nand Sweden.[1]\n\nUnder these circumstances, it was natural that persons interested in\nthe English iron manufacture should turn their attention to some other\ndescription of fuel which should serve as a substitute for the\nprohibited article.  There was known to be an abundance of coal in the\nnorthern and midland counties, and it occurred to some speculators more\nthan usually daring, to propose it as a substitute for the charcoal\nfuel made from wood.  But the same popular prejudice which existed\nagainst the use of coal for domestic purposes, prevented its being\nemployed for purposes of manufacture; and they were thought very\nfoolish persons indeed who first promulgated the idea of smelting iron\nby means of pit-coal.  The old manufacturers held it to be impossible\nto reduce the ore in any other way than by means of charcoal of wood.\nIt was only when the wood in the neighbourhood of the ironworks had\nbeen almost entirely burnt up, that the manufacturers were driven to\nentertain the idea of using coal as a substitute; but more than a\nhundred years passed before the practice of smelting iron by its means\nbecame general.\n\nThe first who took out a patent for the purpose was one Simon\nSturtevant, a German skilled in mining operations; the professed object\nof his invention being \"to neale, melt, and worke all kind of metal\noares, irons, and steeles with sea-coale, pit-coale, earth-coale, and\nbrush fewell.\"  The principal end of his invention, he states in his\nTreatise of Metallica,[2] is to save the consumption and waste of the\nwoods and timber of the country; and, should his design succeed, he\nholds that it \"will prove to be the best and most profitable business\nand invention that ever was known or invented in England these many\nyeares.\"  He says he has already made trial of the process on a small\nscale, and is confident that it will prove equally successful on a\nlarge one.  Sturtevant was not very specific as to his process; but it\nincidentally appears to have been his purpose to reduce the coal by an\nimperfect combustion to the condition of coke, thereby ridding it of\n\"those malignant proprieties which are averse to the nature of\nmetallique substances.\" The subject was treated by him, as was\ncustomary in those days, as a great mystery, made still more mysterious\nby the multitude of learned words under which he undertook to describe\nhis \"Ignick Invention\" All the operations of industry were then treated\nas secrets.  Each trade was a craft, and those who followed it were\ncalled craftsmen.  Even the common carpenter was a handicraftsman; and\nskilled artisans were \"cunning men.\"  But the higher branches of work\nwere mysteries, the communication of which to others was carefully\nguarded by the regulations of the trades guilds.  Although the early\npatents are called specifications, they in reality specify nothing.\nThey are for the most part but a mere haze of words, from which very\nlittle definite information can be gleaned as to the processes\npatented.  It may be that Sturtevant had not yet reduced his idea to\nany practicable method, and therefore could not definitely explain it.\nHowever that may be, it is certain that his process failed when tried\non a large scale, and Sturtevant's patent was accordingly cancelled at\nthe end of a year.\n\n\nThe idea, however, had been fairly born, and repeated patents were\ntaken out with the same object from time to time.  Thus, immediately on\nSturtevant's failure becoming known, one John Rovenzon, who had been\nmixed up with the other's adventure, applied for a patent for making\niron by the same process, which was granted him in 1613.  His 'Treatise\nof Metallica'[3] shows that Rovenzon had a true conception of the\nmethod of manufacture.  Nevertheless he, too, failed in carrying out\nthe invention in practice, and his patent was also cancelled.  Though\nthese failures were very discouraging, like experiments continued to be\nmade and patents taken out,--principally by Dutchmen and\nGermans,[4]--but no decided success seems to have attended their\nefforts until the year 1620, when Lord Dudley took out his patent \"for\nmelting iron ore, making bar-iron, &c., with coal, in furnaces, with\nbellows.\" This patent was taken out at the instance of his son Dud\nDudley, whose story we gather partly from his treatise entitled\n'Metallum Martis,' and partly from various petitions presented by him\nto the king, which are preserved in the State Paper Office, and it runs\nas follows:--\n\nDud Dudley was born in 1599, the natural son of Edward Lord Dudley of\nDudley Castle in the county of Worcester.  He was the fourth of eleven\nchildren by the same mother, who is described in the pedigree of the\nfamily given in the Herald's visitation of the county of Stafford in\nthe year 1663, signed by Dud Dudley himself, as \"Elizabeth, daughter of\nWilliam Tomlinson of Dudley, concubine of Edward Lord Dudley.\" Dud's\neldest brother is described in the same pedigree as Robert Dudley,\nSquire, of Netherton Hall; and as his sisters mostly married well,\nseveral of them county gentlemen, it is obvious that the family,\nnotwithstanding that the children were born out of wedlock, held a good\nposition in their neighbourhood, and were regarded with respect.  Lord\nDudley, though married and having legitimate heirs at the time, seems\nto have attended to the up-bringing of his natural children; educating\nthem carefully, and afterwards employing them in confidential offices\nconnected with the management of his extensive property.  Dud describes\nhimself as taking great delight, when a youth, in his father's\niron-works near Dudley, where he obtained considerable knowledge of the\nvarious processes of the manufacture.\n\nThe town of Dudley was already a centre of the iron manufacture, though\nchiefly of small wares, such as nails, horse-shoes, keys, locks, and\ncommon agricultural tools; and it was estimated that there were about\n20,000 smiths and workers in iron of various kinds living within a\ncircuit of ten miles of Dudley Castle.  But, as in the southern\ncounties, the production of iron had suffered great diminution from the\nwant of fuel in the district, though formerly a mighty woodland\ncountry; and many important branches of the local trade were brought\nalmost to a stand-still.  Yet there was an extraordinary abundance of\ncoal to be met with in the neighbourhood--coal in some places lying in\nseams ten feet thick--ironstone four feet thick immediately under the\ncoal, with limestone conveniently adjacent to both.  The conjunction\nseemed almost providential--\"as if,\" observes Dud, \"God had decreed the\ntime when and how these smiths should be supplied, and this island\nalso, with iron, and most especially that this cole and ironstone\nshould give the first and just occasion for the invention of smelting\niron with pit-cole;\" though, as we have already seen, all attempts\nheretofore made with that object had practically failed.\n\nDud was a special favourite of the Earl his father, who encouraged his\nspeculations with reference to the improvement of the iron manufacture,\nand gave him an education calculated to enable him to turn his\nexcellent practical abilities to account.  He was studying at Baliol\nCollege, Oxford, in the year 1619, when the Earl sent for him to take\ncharge of an iron furnace and two forges in the chase of Pensnet in\nWorcestershire.  He was no sooner installed manager of the works, than,\nfeeling hampered by the want of wood for fuel, his attention was\ndirected to the employment of pit-coal as a substitute.  He altered his\nfurnace accordingly, so as to adapt it to the new process, and the\nresult of the first trial was such as to induce him to persevere.  It\nis nowhere stated in Dud Dudley's Treatise what was the precise nature\nof the method adopted by him; but it is most probable that, in\nendeavouring to substitute coal for wood as fuel, he would subject the\ncoal to a process similar to that of charcoal-burning.  The result\nwould be what is called Coke; and as Dudley informs us that he followed\nup his first experiment with a second blast, by means of which he was\nenabled to produce good marketable iron, the presumption is that his\nsuccess was also due to an improvement of the blast which he contrived\nfor the purpose of keeping up the active combustion of the fuel.\nThough the quantity produced by the new process was comparatively\nsmall--not more than three tons a week from each furnace--Dudley\nanticipated that greater experience would enable him to increase the\nquantity; and at all events he had succeeded in proving the\npracticability of smelting iron with fuel made from pit-coal, which so\nmany before him had tried in vain.\n\nImmediately after the second trial had been made with such good issue,\nDud wrote to his father the Earl, then in London, informing him what he\nhad done, and desiring him at once to obtain a patent for the invention\nfrom King James.  This was readily granted, and the patent (No. 18),\ndated the 22nd February, 1620, was taken out in the name of Lord Dudley\nhimself.\n\nDud proceeded with the manufacture of iron at Pensnet, and also at\nCradley in Staffordshire, where he erected another furnace; and a year\nafter the patent was granted he was enabled to send up to the Tower, by\nthe King's command, a considerable quantity of the new iron for trial.\nMany experiments were made with it:  its qualities were fairly tested,\nand it was pronounced \"good merchantable iron.\"  Dud adds, in his\nTreatise, that his brother-in-law, Richard Parkshouse, of Sedgeley,[5]\n\"had a fowling-gun there made of the Pit-cole iron,\" which was \"well\napproved.\"  There was therefore every prospect of the new method of\nmanufacture becoming fairly established, and with greater experience\nfurther improvements might with confidence be anticipated, when a\nsuccession of calamities occurred to the inventor which involved him in\ndifficulties and put an effectual stop to the progress of his\nenterprise.\n\nThe new works had been in successful operation little more than a year,\nwhen a flood, long after known as the \"Great May-day Flood,\" swept away\nDudley's principal works at Cradley, and otherwise inflicted much\ndamage throughout the district.  \"At the market town called\nStourbridge,\" says Dud, in the course of his curious narrative,\n\"although the author sent with speed to preserve the people from\ndrowning, and one resolute man was carried from the bridge there in the\nday-time, the nether part of the town was so deep in water that the\npeople had much ado to preserve their lives in the uppermost rooms of\ntheir houses.\"  Dudley himself received very little sympathy for his\nlosses.  On the contrary, the iron-smelters of the district rejoiced\nexceedingly at the destruction of his works by the flood.  They had\nseen him making good iron by his new patent process, and selling it\ncheaper than they could afford to do.  They accordingly put in\ncirculation all manner of disparaging reports about his iron.  It was\nbad iron, not fit to be used; indeed no iron, except what was smelted\nwith charcoal of wood, could be good.  To smelt it with coal was a\ndangerous innovation, and could only result in some great public\ncalamity.  The ironmasters even appealed to King James to put a stop to\nDud's manufacture, alleging that his iron was not merchantable.  And\nthen came the great flood, which swept away his works; the hostile\nironmasters now hoping that there was an end for ever of Dudley's\npit-coal iron.\n\nBut Dud, with his wonted energy, forthwith set to work and repaired his\nfurnaces and forges, though at great cost; and in the course of a short\ntime the new manufacture was again in full progress.  The ironmasters\nraised a fresh outcry against him, and addressed another strong\nmemorial against Dud and his iron to King James.  This seems to have\ntaken effect; and in order to ascertain the quality of the article by\ntesting it upon a large scale, the King commanded Dudley to send up to\nthe Tower of London, with every possible speed, quantities of all the\nsorts of bar-iron made by him, fit for the \"making of muskets,\ncarbines, and iron for great bolts for shipping; which iron,\" continues\nDud, \"being so tried by artists and smiths, the ironmasters and\niron-mongers were all silenced until the 21st year of King James's\nreign.\"  The ironmasters then endeavoured to get the Dudley patent\nincluded in the monopolies to be abolished by the statute of that year;\nbut all they could accomplish was the limitation of the patent to\nfourteen years instead of thirty-one; the special exemption of the\npatent from the operation of the statute affording a sufficient\nindication of the importance already attached to the invention.  After\nthat time Dudley \"went on with his invention cheerfully, and made\nannually great store of iron, good and merchantable, and sold it unto\ndiverse men at twelve pounds per ton.\" \"I also,\" said he, \"made all\nsorts of cast-iron wares, as brewing cisterns, pots, mortars, &c.,\nbetter and cheaper than any yet made in these nations with charcoal,\nsome of which are yet to be seen by any man (at the author's house in\nthe city of Worcester) that desires to be satisfied of the truth of the\ninvention.\"\n\nNotwithstanding this decided success, Dudley encountered nothing but\ntrouble and misfortune.  The ironmasters combined to resist his\ninvention; they fastened lawsuit's upon him, and succeeded in getting\nhim ousted from his works at Cradley.  From thence he removed to Himley\nin the county of Stafford, where he set up a pit-coal furnace; but\nbeing without the means of forging the iron into bars, he was\nconstrained to sell the pig-iron to the charcoal-ironmasters, \"who did\nhim much prejudice, not only by detaining his stock, but also by\ndisparaging his iron.\"  He next proceeded to erect a large new furnace\nat Hasco Bridge, near Sedgeley, in the same county, for the purpose of\ncarrying out the manufacture on the most improved principles.  This\nfurnace was of stone, twenty-seven feet square, provided with unusually\nlarge bellows; and when in full work he says he was enabled to turn out\nseven tons of iron per week, \"the greatest quantity of pit-coal iron\never yet made in Great Britain.\"  At the same place he discovered and\nopened out new workings of coal ten feet thick, lying immediately over\nthe ironstone, and he prepared to carry on his operations on a large\nscale; but the new works were scarcely finished when a mob of rioters,\ninstigated by the charcoal-ironmasters, broke in upon them, cut in\npieces the new bellows, destroyed the machinery, and laid the results\nof all his deep-laid ingenuity and persevering industry in ruins.  From\nthat time forward Dudley was allowed no rest nor peace:  he was\nattacked by mobs, worried by lawsuits, and eventually overwhelmed by\ndebts.  He was then seized by his creditors and sent up to London,\nwhere he was held a prisoner in the Comptoir for several thousand\npounds.  The charcoal-iron men thus for a time remained masters of the\nfield.\n\nCharles I. seems to have taken pity on the suffering inventor; and on\nhis earnest petition, setting forth the great advantages to the nation\nof his invention, from which he had as yet derived no advantage, but\nonly losses, sufferings, and persecution, the King granted him a\nrenewal of his patent[6] in the year 1638; three other gentlemen\njoining him as partners, and doubtless providing the requisite capital\nfor carrying on the manufacture after the plans of the inventor.  But\nDud's evil fortune continued to pursue him.  The patent had scarcely\nbeen securedere the Civil War broke out, and the arts of peace must at\nonce perforce give place to the arts of war.  Dud's nature would not\nsuffer him to be neutral at such a time; and when the nation divided\nitself into two hostile camps, his predilections being strongly\nloyalist, he took the side of the King with his father.  It would\nappear from a petition presented by him to Charles II. in 1660, setting\nforth his sufferings in the royal cause, and praying for restoral to\ncertain offices which he had enjoyed under Charles I., that as early as\nthe year 1637 he had been employed by the King on a mission into\nScotland,[7] in the train of the Marquis of Hamilton, the King's\nCommissioner.  Again in 1639, leaving his ironworks and partners, he\naccompanied Charles on his expedition across the Scotch border, and was\npresent with the army until its discomfiture at Newburn near Newcastle\nin the following year.\n\nThe sword was now fairly drawn, and Dud seems for a time to have\nabandoned his iron-works and followed entirely the fortunes of the\nking.  He was sworn surveyor of the Mews or Armoury in 1640, but being\nunable to pay for the patent, another was sworn in in his place.  Yet\nhis loyalty did not falter, for in the beginning of 1642, when Charles\nset out from London, shortly after the fall of Strafford and Laud, Dud\nwent with him.[8]  He was present before Hull when Sir John Hotham shut\nits gates in the king's face; at York when the royal commissions of\narray were sent out enjoining all loyal subjects to send men, arms,\nmoney, and horses, for defence of the king and maintenance of the law;\nat Nottingham, where the royal standard was raised; at Coventry, where\nthe townspeople refused the king entrance and fired upon his troops\nfrom the walls; at Edgehill, where the first great but indecisive\nbattle was fought between the contending parties; in short, as Dud\nDudley states in his petition, he was \"in most of the battailes that\nyear, and also supplyed his late sacred Majestie's magazines of\nStafford, Worcester, Dudley Castle, and Oxford, with arms, shot,\ndrakes, and cannon; and also, became major unto Sir Frauncis Worsley's\nregiment, which was much decaied.\"\n\nIn 1643, according to the statement contained in his petition above\nreferred to, Dud Dudley acted as military engineer in setting out the\nfortifications of Worcester and Stafford, and furnishing them with\nordnance.  After the taking of Lichfield, in which he had a share, he\nwas made Colonel of Dragoons, and accompanied the Queen with his\nregiment to the royal head-quarters at Oxford.  The year after we find\nhim at the siege of Gloucester, then at the first battle of Newbury\nleading the forlorn hope with Sir George Lisle, afterwards marching\nwith Sir Charles Lucas into the associate counties, and present at the\nroyalist rout at Newport.  That he was esteemed a valiant and skilful\nofficer is apparent from the circumstance, that in 1645 he was\nappointed general of Prince Maurice's train of artillery, and\nafterwards held the same rank under Lord Ashley.  The iron districts\nbeing still for the most part occupied by the royal armies, our\nmilitary engineer turned his practical experience to account by\ndirecting the forging of drakes[9] of bar-iron, which were found of\ngreat use, giving up his own dwelling-house in the city of Worcester\nfor the purpose of carrying on the manufacture of these and other arms.\nBut Worcester and the western towns fell before the Parliamentarian\narmies in 1646, and all the iron-works belonging to royalists, from\nwhich the principal supplies of arms had been drawn by the King's army,\nwere forthwith destroyed.\n\nDudley fully shared in the dangers and vicissitudes of that trying\nperiod, and bore his part throughout like a valiant soldier.  For two\nyears nothing was heard of him, until in 1648, when the king's party\ndrew together again, and made head in different parts of the country,\nnorth and south.  Goring raised his standard in Essex, but was driven\nby Fairfax into Colchester, where he defended himself for two months.\nWhile the siege was in progress, the royalists determined to make an\nattempt to raise it.  On this Dud Dudley again made his appearance in\nthe field, and, joining sundry other counties, he proceeded to raise\n200 men, mostly at his own charge.  They were, however, no sooner\nmustered in Bosco Bello woods near Madeley, than they were attacked by\nthe Parliamentarians, and dispersed or taken prisoners.  Dud was among\nthose so taken, and he was first carried to Hartlebury Castle and\nthence to Worcester, where he was imprisoned.  Recounting the\nsufferings of himself and his followers on this occasion, in the\npetition presented to Charles II. in 1660,[10] he says, \"200 men were\ndispersed, killed, and some taken, namely, Major Harcourt, Major\nElliotts, Capt.  Long, and Cornet Hodgetts, of whom Major Harcourt was\nmiserably burned with matches.  The petitioner and the rest were\nstripped almost naked, and in triumph and scorn carried up to the city\nof Worcester (which place Dud had fortified for the king), and kept\nclose prisoners, with double guards set upon the prison and the city.\"\n\nNotwithstanding this close watch and durance, Dudley and Major Elliotts\ncontrived to break out of gaol, making their way over the tops of the\nhouses, afterwards passing the guards at the city gates, and escaping\ninto the open country.  Being hotly pursued, they travelled during the\nnight, and took to the trees during the daytime.  They succeeded in\nreaching London, but only to drop again into the lion's mouth; for\nfirst Major Elliotts was captured, then Dudley, and both were taken\nbefore Sir John Warner, the Lord Mayor, who forthwith sent them before\nthe \"cursed committee of insurrection,\" as Dudley calls them.  The\nprisoners were summarily sentenced to be shot to death, and were\nmeanwhile closely imprisoned in the Gatehouse at Westminster, with\nother Royalists.\n\nThe day before their intended execution, the prisoners formed a plan of\nescape.  It was Sunday morning, the 20th August, 1648, when they seized\ntheir opportunity, \"at ten of the cloeke in sermon time;\" and,\noverpowering the gaolers, Dudley, with Sir Henry Bates, Major Elliotts,\nCaptain South, Captain Paris, and six others, succeeded in getting\naway, and making again for the open country.  Dudley had received a\nwound in the leg, and could only get along with great difficulty.  He\nrecords that he proceeded on crutches, through Worcester, Tewkesbury,\nand Gloucester, to Bristol, having been \"fed three weeks in private in\nan enemy's hay mow.\"  Even the most lynx-eyed Parliamentarian must have\nfailed to recognise the quondam royalist general of artillery in the\nhelpless creature dragging himself along upon crutches; and he reached\nBristol in safety.\n\nHis military career now over, he found himself absolutely penniless.\nHis estate of about 200L. per annum had been sequestrated and sold by\nthe government;[11] his house in Worcester had been seized and his\nsickly wife turned out of doors; and his goods, stock, great shop, and\nironworks, which he himself valued at 2000L., were destroyed.  He had\nalso lost the offices of Serjeant-at-arms, Lieutenant of Ordnance, and\nSurveyor of the Mews, which he had held under the king; in a word, he\nfound himself reduced to a state of utter destitution.\n\nDudley was for some time under the necessity of living in great privacy\nat Bristol; but when the king had been executed, and the royalists were\nfinally crushed at Worcester, Dud gradually emerged from his\nconcealment.  He was still the sole possessor of the grand secret of\nsmelting iron with pit-coal, and he resolved upon one more commercial\nadventure, in the hope of yet turning it to good account.  He succeeded\nin inducing Walter Stevens, linendraper, and John Stone, merchant, both\nof Bristol, to join him as partners in an ironwork, which they\nproceeded to erect near that city.  The buildings were well advanced,\nand nearly 700L. had been expended, when a quarrel occurred between\nDudley and his partners, which ended in the stoppage of the works, and\nthe concern being thrown into Chancery.  Dudley alleges that the other\npartners \"cunningly drew him into a bond,\" and \"did unjustly enter\nstaple actions in Bristol of great value against him, because he was of\nthe king's party;\" but it would appear as if there had been some twist\nor infirmity of temper in Dudley himself, which prevented him from\nworking harmoniously with such persons as he became associated with in\naffairs of business.\n\nIn the mean time other attempts were made to smelt iron with pit-coal.\nDudley says that Cromwell and the then Parliament granted a patent to\nCaptain Buck for the purpose; and that Cromwell himself, Major Wildman,\nand various others were partners in the patent.  They erected furnaces\nand works in the Forest of Dean;[12] but, though Cromwell and his\nofficers could fight and win battles, they could not smelt and forge\niron with pit-coal.  They brought one Dagney, an Italian glass-maker,\nfrom Bristol, to erect a new furnace for them, provided with sundry\npots of glass-house clay; but no success attended their efforts.  The\npartners knowing of Dudley's possession of the grand secret, invited\nhim to visit their works; but all they could draw from him was that\nthey would never succeed in making iron to profit by the methods they\nwere pursuing.  They next proceeded to erect other works at Bristol,\nbut still they failed.  Major Wildman[13] bought Dudley's sequestrated\nestate, in the hope of being able to extort his secret of making iron\nwith pit-coal; but all their attempts proving abortive, they at length\nabandoned the enterprise in despair.  In 1656, one Captain Copley\nobtained from Cromwell a further patent with a similar object; and\nerected works near Bristol, and also in the Forest of Kingswood.  The\nmechanical engineers employed by Copley failed in making his bellows\nblow; on which he sent for Dudley, who forthwith \"made his bellows to\nbe blown feisibly;\" but Copley failed, like his predecessors, in making\niron, and at length he too desisted from further experiments.\n\nSuch continued to be the state of things until the Restoration, when we\nfind Dud Dudley a petitioner to the king for the renewal of his patent.\nHe was also a petitioner for compensation in respect of the heavy\nlosses he had sustained during the civil wars.  The king was besieged\nby crowds of applicants of a similar sort, but Dudley was no more\nsuccessful than the others.  He failed in obtaining the renewal of his\npatent.  Another applicant for the like privilege, probably having\ngreater interest at court, proved more successful.  Colonel Proger and\nthree others[14] were granted a patent to make iron with coal; but\nDudley knew the secret, which the new patentees did not; and their\npatent came to nothing.\n\nDudley continued to address the king in importunate petitions, asking\nto be restored to his former offices of Serjeant-at-arms, Lieutenant of\nOrdnance, and Surveyor of the Mews or Armoury.  He also petitioned to\nbe appointed Master of the Charter House in Smithfield, professing\nhimself willing to take anything, or hold any living.[15]  We find him\nsending in two petitions to a similar effect in June, 1660; and a third\nshortly after.  The result was, that he was reappointed to the office\nof Serjeant-at-Arms; but the Mastership of the Charter-House was not\ndisposed of until 1662, when it fell to the lot of one Thomas\nWatson.[16]  In 1661, we find a patent granted to Wm. Chamberlaine\nand--Dudley, Esq., for the sole use of their new invention of plating\nsteel, &c., and tinning the said plates; but whether Dud Dudley was the\nperson referred to, we are unable precisely to determine.  A few years\nlater, he seems to have succeeded in obtaining the means of prosecuting\nhis original invention; for in his Metallum Martis, published in 1665,\nhe describes himself as living at Green's Lodge, in Staffordshire; and\nhe says that near it are four forges, Green's Forge, Swin Forge, Heath\nForge, and Cradley Forge, where he practises his \"perfect invention.\"\nThese forges, he adds, \"have barred all or most part of their iron with\npit-coal since the authors first invention In 1618, which hath\npreserved much wood.  In these four, besides many other forges, do the\nlike [sic ]; yet the author hath had no benefit thereby to this\npresent.\"  From that time forward, Dud becomes lost to sight.  He seems\neventually to have retired to St.  Helen's in Worcestershire, where he\ndied in 1684, in the 85th year of his age.  He was buried in the parish\nchurch there, and a monument, now destroyed, was erected to his memory,\nbearing the inscription partly set forth underneath.[17]\n\n\n\n[1] As late as 1790, long after the monopoly of the foreign merchants\nhad been abolished, Pennant says, \"The present Steelyard is the great\nrepository of imported iron, which furnishes our metropolis with that\nnecessary material.  The quantity of bars that fills the yards and\nwarehouses of this quarter strikes with astonishment the most\nindifferent beholder.\"--PENNANT, Account of London, 309.\n\n[2] STURTEVANT'S Metallica; briefly comprehending the Doctrine of\nDiverse New Metallical Inventions, &c.

Her husband having been created a baron by the title of\nBaron Ward of Birmingham, and Frances becoming Baroness of Dudley in\nher own right on the demise of her father, the baronies of Dudley and\nWard thus became united in their eldest son Edward in the year 1697.\n\n[6] Patent No. 117, Old Series, granted in 1638, to Sir George Horsey,\nDavid Ramsey, Roger Foulke, and Dudd Dudley.\n\n[7] By his own account, given in Metallum Martis, while in Scotland in\n1637, he visited the Highlands as well as the Lowlands, spending the\nwhole summer of that year \"in opening of mines and making of\ndiscoveries;\" spending part of the time with Sir James Hope of Lead\nHills, near where, he says, \"he got gold.\"  It does not appear,\nhowever, that any iron forges existed in Scotland at the time:  indeed\nDudley expressly says that \"Scotland maketh no iron;\" and in his\ntreatise of 1665 he urges that the Corporation of the Mines Royal\nshould set him and his inventions at work to enable Scotland to enjoy\nthe benefit of a cheap and abundant supply of the manufactured article.\n\n[8] The Journals of the House of Commons, of the 13th June, 1642,\ncontain the resolution \"that Captain Wolseley, Ensign Dudley, and John\nLometon be forthwith sent for, as delinquents, by the Serjeant-at-Arms\nattending on the House, for giving interruption to the execution of the\nordinance of the militia in the county of Leicester.\"\n\n[9] Small pieces of artillery, specimens of which are still to be seen\nin the museum at Woolwich Arsenal and at the Tower.\n\n[10] State Paper Office, Dom.

And\nsuch, emphatically, was Andrew Yarranton, a true patriot in the best\nsense of the word.\"--DOVE, Elements of Political Science.\n\n\nThat industry had a sore time of it during the civil wars will further\nappear from the following brief account of Andrew Yarranton, which may\nbe taken as a companion memoir to that of Dud Dudley.  For Yarranton\nalso was a Worcester ironmaster and a soldier--though on the opposite\nside,--but more even than Dudley was he a man of public spirit and\nenterprise, an enlightened political economist (long before political\neconomy had been recognised as a science), and in many respects a true\nnational benefactor.  Bishop Watson said that he ought to have had a\nstatue erected to his memory because of his eminent public services;\nand an able modern writer has gone so far as to say of him that he was\n\"the founder of English political economy, the first man in England who\nsaw and said that peace was better than war, that trade was better than\nplunder, that honest industry was better than martial greatness, and\nthat the best occupation of a government was to secure prosperity at\nhome, and let other nations alone.\" [1]\n\nYet the name of Andrew Yarranton is scarcely remembered, or is at most\nknown to only a few readers of half-forgotten books.  The following\nbrief outline of his history is gathered from his own narrative and\nfrom documents in the State Paper Office.\n\nAndrew Yarranton was born at the farmstead of Larford, in the parish of\nAstley, in Worcestershire, in the year 1616.[2]  In his sixteenth year\nhe was put apprentice to a Worcester linendraper, and remained at that\ntrade for some years; but not liking it, he left it, and was leading a\ncountry life when the civil wars broke out.  Unlike Dudley, he took the\nside of the Parliament, and joined their army, in which he served for\nsome time as a soldier.  His zeal and abilities commended him to his\nofficers, and he was raised from one position to another, until in the\ncourse of a few years we find him holding the rank of captain.  \"While\na soldier,\" says he, \"I had sometimes the honour and misfortune to\nlodge and dislodge an army;\" but this is all the information he gives\nus of his military career.  In the year 1648 he was instrumental in\ndiscovering and frustrating a design on the part of the Royalists to\nseize Doyley House in the county of Hereford, and other strongholds,\nfor which he received the thanks of Parliament \"for his ingenuity,\ndiscretion, and valour,\" and a substantial reward of 500L.[3]  He was\nalso recommended to the Committee of Worcester for further employment.\nBut from that time we hear no more of him in connection with the civil\nwars.  When Cromwell assumed the supreme control of affairs, Yarranton\nretired from the army with most of the Presbyterians, and devoted\nhimself to industrial pursuits.\n\nWe then find him engaged in carrying on the manufacture of iron at\nAshley, near Bewdley, in Worcestershire.  \"In the year 1652\", says he,\n\"I entered upon iron-works, and plied them for several years.\" [4]  He\nmade it a subject of his diligent study how to provide employment for\nthe poor, then much distressed by the late wars.  With the help of his\nwife, he established a manufacture of linen, which was attended with\ngood results.  Observing how the difficulties of communication, by\nreason of the badness of the roads, hindered the development of the\nrich natural resources of the western counties,[5] he applied himself\nto the improvement of the navigation of the larger rivers, making\nsurveys of them at his own cost, and endeavouring to stimulate local\nenterprise so as to enable him to carry his plans into effect.\n\nWhile thus occupied, the restoration of Charles II. took place, and\nwhether through envy or enmity Yarranton's activity excited the\nsuspicion of the authorities.  His journeys from place to place seemed\nto them to point to some Presbyterian plot on foot.  On the 13th of\nNovember, 1660, Lord Windsor, Lord-Lieutenant of the county, wrote to\nthe Secretary of State--\"There is a quaker in prison for speaking\ntreason against his Majesty, and a countryman also, and Captain\nYarrington for refusing to obey my authority.\" [6]  It would appear\nfrom subsequent letters that Yarranton must have lain in prison for\nnearly two years, charged with conspiring against the king's authority,\nthe only evidence against him consisting of some anonymous letter's.\nAt the end of May, 1662, he succeeded in making his escape from the\ncustody of the Provost Marshal.  The High Sheriff scoured the country\nafter him at the head of a party of horse, and then he communicated to\nthe Secretary of State, Sir Edward Nicholas, that the suspected\nconspirator could not be found, and was supposed to have made his way\nto London.  Before the end of a month Yarranton was again in custody,\nas appears from the communication of certain justices of Surrey to Sir\nEdward Nicholas.[7]  As no further notice of Yarranton occurs in the\nState Papers, and as we shortly after find him publicly occupied in\ncarrying out his plans for improving the navigation of the western\nrivers, it is probable that his innocence of any plot was established\nafter a legal investigation.  A few years later he published in London\na 4to. tract entitled 'A Full Discovery of the First Presbyterian Sham\nPlot,' which most probably contained a vindication of his conduct.[8]\n\nYarranton was no sooner at liberty than we find him again occupied with\nhis plans of improved inland navigation.  His first scheme was to\ndeepen the small river Salwarp, so as to connect Droitwich with the\nSevern by a water communication, and thus facilitate the transport of\nthe salt so abundantly yielded by the brine springs near that town.  In\n1665, the burgesses of Droitwich agreed to give him 750L. and eight\nsalt vats in Upwich, valued at 80L. per annum, with three-quarters of a\nvat in Northwich, for twenty-one years, in payment for the work.  But\nthe times were still unsettled, and Yarranton and his partner Wall not\nbeing rich, the scheme was not then carried into effect.[9]  In the\nfollowing year we find him occupied with a similar scheme to open up\nthe navigation of the river Stour, passing by Stourport and\nKidderminster, and connect it by an artificial cut with the river\nTrent.  Some progress was made with this undertaking, so far in advance\nof the age, but, like the other, it came to a stand still for want of\nmoney, and more than a hundred years passed before it was carried out\nby a kindred genius--James Brindley, the great canal maker.  Mr.\nChambers says that when Yarranton's scheme was first brought forward,\nit met with violent opposition and ridicule.  The undertaking was\nthought wonderfully bold, and, joined to its great extent, the sandy,\nspongy nature of the ground, the high banks necessary to prevent the\ninundation of the Stour on the canal, furnished its opponents, if not\nwith sound argument, at least with very specious topics for opposition\nand laughter.[10]  Yarranton's plan was to make the river itself\nnavigable, and by uniting it with other rivers, open up a communication\nwith the Trent; while Brindley's was to cut a canal parallel with the\nriver, and supply it with water from thence.  Yarranton himself thus\naccounts for the failure of his scheme in 'England's Improvement by Sea\nand Land':--\"It was my projection,\" he says, \"and I will tell you the\nreason why it was not finished.  The river Stour and some other rivers\nwere granted by an Act of Parliament to certain persons of honor, and\nsome progress was made in the work, but within a small while after the\nAct passed[11] it was let fall again; but it being a brat of my own, I\nwas not willing it should be abortive, wherefore I made offers to\nperfect it, having a third part of the inheritance to me and my heirs\nfor ever, and we came to an agreement, upon which I fell on, and made\nit completely navigable from Stourbridge to Kidderminster, and carried\ndown many hundred tons of coal, and laid out near 1000L., and there it\nwas obstructed for want of money.\" [12]\n\nAnother of Yarranton's far-sighted schemes of a similar kind was one to\nconnect the Thames with the Severn by means of an artificial cut, at\nthe very place where, more than a century after his death, it was\nactually carried out by modern engineers.  This canal, it appears, was\ntwice surveyed under his direction by his son.  He did, however,\nsucceed in his own time in opening up the navigation of the Avon, and\nwas the first to carry barges upon its waters from Tewkesbury to\nStratford.\n\nThe improvement of agriculture, too, had a share of Yarranton's\nattention.  He saw the soil exhausted by long tillage and constantly\nrepeated crops of rye, and he urged that the land should have rest or\nat least rotation of crop.  With this object he introduced clover-seed,\nand supplied it largely to the farmers of the western counties, who\nfound their land doubled in value by the new method of husbandry, and\nit shortly became adopted throughout the country.  Seeing how commerce\nwas retarded by the small accommodation provided for shipping at the\nthen principal ports, Yarranton next made surveys and planned docks for\nthe city of London; but though he zealously advocated the subject, he\nfound few supporters, and his plans proved fruitless.  In this respect\nhe was nearly a hundred and fifty years before his age, and the London\nimporters continued to conduct their shipping business in the crowded\ntideway of the Thames down even to the beginning of the present century.\n\nWhile carrying on his iron works, it occurred to Yarranton that it\nwould be of great national advantage if the manufacture of tin-plate\ncould be introduced into England.  Although the richest tin mines then\nknown existed in this country, the mechanical arts were at so low an\nebb that we were almost entirely dependent upon foreigners for the\nsupply of the articles manufactured from the metal.  The Saxons were\nthe principal consumers of English tin, and we obtained from them in\nreturn nearly the whole of our tin-plates.  All attempts made to\nmanufacture them in England had hitherto failed; the beating out of the\niron by hammers into laminae sufficiently thin and smooth, and the\nsubsequent distribution and fixing of the film of tin over the surface\nof the iron, proving difficulties which the English manufacturers were\nunable to overcome.  To master these difficulties the indefatigable\nYarranton set himself to work.  \"Knowing,\" says he, \"the usefulness of\ntin-plates and the goodness of our metals for that purpose, I did,\nabout sixteen years since (i.e.  about 1665), endeavour to find out the\nway for making thereof; whereupon I acquainted a person of much riches,\nand one that was very understanding in the iron manufacture, who was\npleased to say that he had often designed to get the trade into\nEngland, but never could find out the way.  Upon which it was agreed\nthat a sum of monies should be advanced by several persons,[13] for the\ndefraying of my charges of travelling to the place where these plates\nare made, and from thence to bring away the art of making them.  Upon\nwhich, an able fire-man, that well understood the nature of iron, was\nmade choice of to accompany me; and being fitted with an ingenious\ninterpreter that well understood the language, and that had dealt much\nin that commodity, we marched first for Hamburgh, then to Leipsic, and\nfrom thence to Dresden, the Duke of Saxony's court, where we had notice\nof the place where the plates were made; which was in a large tract of\nmountainous land, running from a place called Seger-Hutton unto a town\ncalled Awe [Au], being in length about twenty miles.\" [14]\n\nIt is curious to find how much the national industry of England has\nbeen influenced by the existence from time to time of religious\npersecutions abroad, which had the effect of driving skilled Protestant\nartisans, more particularly from Flanders and France, into England,\nwhere they enjoyed the special protection of successive English\nGovernments, and founded various important branches of manufacture.\nBut it appears from the history of the tin manufactures of Saxony, that\nthat country also had profited in like manner by the religious\npersecutions of Germany, and even of England itself.  Thus we are told\nby Yarranton that it was a Cornish miner, a Protestant, banished out of\nEngland for his religion in Queen Mary's time, who discovered the tin\nmines at Awe, and that a Romish priest of Bohemia, who had been\nconverted to Lutheranism and fled into Saxony for refuge, \"was the\nchief instrument in the manufacture until it was perfected.\"  These two\nmen were held in great regard by the Duke of Saxony as well as by the\npeople of the country; for their ingenuity and industry proved the\nsource of great prosperity and wealth, \"several fine cities,\" says\nYarranton, \"having been raised by the riches proceeding from the\ntin-works\"--not less than 80,000 men depending upon the trade for their\nsubsistence; and when Yarranton visited Awe, he found that a statue had\nbeen erected to the memory of the Cornish miner who first discovered\nthe tin.\n\nYarranton was very civilly received by the miners, and, contrary to his\nexpectation, he was allowed freely to inspect the tin-works and examine\nthe methods by which the iron-plates were rolled out, as well as the\nprocess of tinning them.  He was even permitted to engage a number of\nskilled workmen, whom he brought over with him to England for the\npurpose of starting the manufacture in this country.  A beginning was\nmade, and the tin-plates manufactured by Yarranton's men were\npronounced of better quality even than those made in Saxony.  \"Many\nthousand plates,\" Yarranton says, \"were made from iron raised in the\nForest of Dean, and were tinned over with Cornish tin; and the plates\nproved far better than the German ones, by reason of the toughness and\nflexibleness of our forest iron.  One Mr. Bison, a tinman in Worcester,\nMr. Lydiate near Fleet Bridge, and Mr. Harrison near the King's Bench,\nhave wrought many, and know their goodness.\" As Yarranton's account was\nwritten and published during the lifetime of the parties, there is no\nreason to doubt the accuracy of his statement.\n\nArrangements were made to carry on the manufacture upon a large scale;\nbut the secret having got wind, a patent was taken out, or \"trumpt up\"\nas Yarranton calls it, for the manufacture, \"the patentee being\ncountenanced by some persons of quality,\" and Yarranton was precluded\nfrom carrying his operations further.  It is not improbable that the\npatentee in question was William Chamberlaine, Dud Dudley's quondam\npartner in the iron manufacture.[15]  \"What with the patent being in\nour way,\" says Yarranton, \"and the richest of our partners being afraid\nto offend great men in power, who had their eye upon us, it caused the\nthing to cool, and the making of the tin-plates was neither proceeded\nin by us, nor possibly could be by him that had the patent; because\nneither he that hath the patent, nor those that have countenanced him,\ncan make one plate fit for use.\" Yarranton's labours were thus lost to\nthe English public for a time; and we continued to import all our\ntin-plates from Germany until about sixty years later, when a tin-plate\nmanufactory was established by Capel Hanbury at Pontypool in\nMonmouthshire, where it has since continued to be successfully carried\non.\n\nWe can only briefly refer to the subsequent history of Andrew\nYarranton.  Shortly after his journey into Saxony, he proceeded to\nHolland to examine the inland navigations of the Dutch, to inspect\ntheir linen and other manufactures, and to inquire into the causes of\nthe then extraordinary prosperity of that country compared with\nEngland.  Industry was in a very languishing state at home.  \"People\nconfess they are sick,\" said Yarranton, \"that trade is in a\nconsumption, and the whole nation languishes.\"  He therefore determined\nto ascertain whether something useful might not be learnt from the\nexample of Holland.  The Dutch were then the hardest working and the\nmost thriving people in Europe.  They were manufacturers and carriers\nfor the world.  Their fleets floated on every known sea; and their\nherring-busses swarmed along our coasts as far north as the Hebrides.\nThe Dutch supplied our markets with fish caught within sight of our own\nshores, while our coasting population stood idly looking on.  Yarranton\nregarded this state of things as most discreditable, and he urged the\nestablishment of various branches of home industry as the best way of\nout-doing the Dutch without fighting them.\n\nWherever he travelled abroad, in Germany or in Holland, he saw industry\nattended by wealth and comfort, and idleness by poverty and misery.\nThe same pursuits, he held, would prove as beneficial to England as\nthey were abundantly proved to have been to Holland.  The healthy life\nof work was good for all--for individuals as for the whole nation; and\nif we would out-do the Dutch, he held that we must out-do them in\nindustry.  But all must be done honestly and by fair means.  \"Common\nHonesty,\" said Yarranton, \"is as necessary and needful in kingdoms and\ncommonwealths that depend upon Trade, as discipline is in an army; and\nwhere there is want of common Honesty in a kingdom or commonwealth,\nfrom thence Trade shall depart.  For as the Honesty of all governments\nis, so shall be their Riches; and as their Honour, Honesty, and Riches\nare, so will be their Strength; and as their Honour, Honesty, Riches,\nand Strength are, so will be their Trade.  These are five sisters that\ngo hand in hand, and must not be parted.\" Admirable sentiments, which\nare as true now as they were two hundred years ago, when Yarranton\nurged them upon the attention of the English public.\n\nOn his return from Holland, he accordingly set on foot various schemes\nof public utility.  He stirred up a movement for the encouragement of\nthe British fisheries.  He made several journeys into Ireland for the\npurpose of planting new manufactures there.  He surveyed the River\nSlade with the object of rendering it navigable, and proposed a plan\nfor improving the harbour of Dublin.  He also surveyed the Dee in\nEngland with a view to its being connected with the Severn.  Chambers\nsays that on the decline of his popularity in 1677, he was taken by\nLord Clarendon to Salisbury to survey the River Avon, and find out how\nthat river might be made navigable, and also whether a safe harbour for\nships could be made at Christchurch; and that having found where he\nthought safe anchorage might be obtained, his Lordship proceeded to act\nupon Yarranton's recommendations.[16]\n\nAnother of his grand schemes was the establishment of the linen\nmanufacture in the central counties of England, which, he showed, were\nwell adapted for the growth of flax; and he calculated that if success\nattended his efforts, at least two millions of money then sent out of\nthe country for the purchase of foreign linen would be retained at\nhome, besides increasing the value of the land on which the flax was\ngrown, and giving remunerative employment to our own people, then\nemigrating for want of work.  \"Nothing but Sloth or Envy,\" he said,\n\"can possibly hinder my labours from being crowned with the wished for\nsuccess; our habitual fondness for the one hath already brought us to\nthe brink of ruin, and our proneness to the other hath almost\ndiscouraged all pious endeavours to promote our future happiness.\"\n\nIn 1677 he published the first part of his England's Improvement by Sea\nand Land--a very remarkable book, full of sagacious insight as\nrespected the future commercial and manufacturing greatness of England.\nMr. Dove says of this book that \"Yarranton chalks out in it the future\ncourse of Britain with as free a hand as if second-sight had revealed\nto him those expansions of her industrial career which never fail to\nsurprise us, even when we behold them realized.\" Besides his extensive\nplans for making harbours and improving internal navigation with the\nobject of creating new channels for domestic industry, his schemes for\nextending the iron and the woollen trades, establishing the linen\nmanufacture, and cultivating the home fisheries, we find him throwing\nout various valuable suggestions with reference to the means of\nfacilitating commercial transactions, some of winch have only been\ncarried out in our own day.  One of his grandest ideas was the\nestablishment of a public bank, the credit of which, based upon the\nsecurity of freehold land,[17] should enable its paper \"to go in trade\nequal with ready money.\"  A bank of this sort formed one of the\nprincipal means by which the Dutch had been enabled to extend their\ncommercial transactions, and Yarranton accordingly urged its\nintroduction into England.  Part of his scheme consisted of a voluntary\nregister of real property, for the purpose of effecting simplicity of\ntitle, and obtaining relief from the excessive charges for law,[18] as\nwell as enabling money to be readily raised for commercial purposes on\nsecurity of the land registered.\n\nHe pointed out very graphically the straits to which a man is put who\nis possessed of real property enough, but in a time of pressure is\nunable to turn himself round for want of ready cash.  \"Then,\" says he,\n\"all his creditors crowd to him as pigs do through a hole to a bean and\npease rick.\"  \"Is it not a sad thing,\" he asks, \"that a goldsmith's boy\nin Lombard Street, who gives notes for the monies handed him by the\nmerchants, should take up more monies upon his notes in one day than\ntwo lords, four knights, and eight esquires in twelve months upon all\ntheir personal securities? We are, as it were, cutting off our legs and\narms to see who will feed the trunk.  But we cannot expect this from\nany of our neighbours abroad, whose interest depends upon our loss.\"\n\nHe therefore proposed his registry of property as a ready means of\nraising a credit for purposes of trade.  Thus, he says, \"I can both in\nEngland and Wales register my wedding, my burial, and my christening,\nand a poor parish clerk is entrusted with the keeping of the book; and\nthat which is registered there is held good by our law.  But I cannot\nregister my lands, to be honest, to pay every man his own, to prevent\nthose sad things that attend families for want thereof, and to have the\ngreat benefit and advantage that would come thereby.  A register will\nquicken trade, and the land registered will be equal as cash in a man's\nhands, and the credit thereof will go and do in trade what ready money\nnow doth.\"  His idea was to raise money, when necessary, on the land\nregistered, by giving security thereon after a form which he suggested.\nHe would, in fact, have made land, as gold now is, the basis of an\nextended currency; and he rightly held that the value of land as a\nsecurity must always be unexceptionable, and superior to any metallic\nbasis that could possibly be devised.\n\nThis indefatigable man continued to urge his various designs upon the\nattention of the public until he was far advanced in years.  He\nprofessed that he was moved to do so (and we believe him) solely by an\nardent love for his country, \"whose future flourishing,\" said he, \"is\nthe only reward I ever hope to see of all my labours.\"  Yarranton,\nhowever, received but little thanks for his persistency, while he\nencountered many rebuffs.  The public for the most part turned a deaf\near to his entreaties; and his writings proved of comparatively small\navail, at least during his own lifetime.  He experienced the lot of\nmany patriots, even the purest--the suspicion and detraction of his\ncontemporaries.  His old political enemies do not seem to have\nforgotten him, of which we have the evidence in certain rare\n\"broadsides\" still extant, twitting him with the failure of his\nschemes, and even trumping up false charges of disloyalty against\nhim.[19]\n\nIn 1681 he published the second part of 'England's Improvement,'[20] in\nwhich he gave a summary account of its then limited growths and\nmanufactures, pointing out that England and Ireland were the only\nnorthern kingdoms remaining unimproved; he re-urged the benefits and\nnecessity of a voluntary register of real property; pointed out a\nmethod of improving the Royal Navy, lessening the growing power of\nFrance, and establishing home fisheries; proposed the securing and\nfortifying of Tangier; described a plan for preventing fires in London,\nand reducing the charge for maintaining the Trained Bands; urged the\nformation of a harbour at Newhaven in Sussex; and, finally, discoursed\nat considerable length upon the tin, iron, linen, and woollen trades,\nsetting forth various methods for their improvement.  In this last\nsection, after referring to the depression in the domestic tin trade\n(Cornish tin selling so low as 70s. the cwt.), he suggested a way of\nreviving it.  With the Cornish tin he would combine \"the Roman cinders\nand iron-stone in the Forest of Dean, which makes the best iron for\nmost uses in the world, and works up to the best advantage, with\ndelight and pleasure to the workmen.\"  He then described the history of\nhis own efforts to import the manufacture of tin-plates into England\nsome sixteen years before, in which he had been thwarted by\nChamberlaine's patent, as above described,--and offered sundry queries\nas to the utility of patents generally, which, says he, \"have the\ntendency to drive trade out of the kingdom.\" Appended to the chapter on\nTin is an exceedingly amusing dialogue between a tin-miner of Cornwall,\nan iron-miner of Dean Forest, and a traveller (himself).  From this we\ngather that Yarranton's business continued to be that of an\niron-manufacturer at his works at Ashley near Bewdley.  Thus the\niron-miner says, \"About 28 years since Mr. Yarranton found out a vast\nquantity of Roman cinders, near the walls of the city of Worcester,\nfrom whence he and others carried away many thousand tons or loads up\nthe river Severn, unto their iron-furnaces, to be melted down into\niron, with a mixture of the Forest of Dean iron-stone; and within 100\nyards of the walls of the city of Worcester there was dug up one of the\nhearths of the Roman foot-blasts, it being then firm and in order, and\nwas 7 foot deep in the earth; and by the side of the work there was\nfound a pot of Roman coin to the quantity of a peck, some of which was\npresented to Sir [Wm.] Dugdale, and part thereof is now in the King's\nCloset.\" [21]\n\nIn the same year (1681) in which the second part of 'England's\nImprovement' appeared, Yarranton proceeded to Dunkirk for the purpose\nof making a personal survey of that port, then belonging to England;\nand on his return he published a map of the town, harbour, and castle\non the sea, with accompanying letterpress, in which he recommended, for\nthe safety of British trade, the demolition of the fortifications of\nDunkirk before they were completed, which he held would only be for the\npurpose of their being garrisoned by the French king.  His 'Full\nDiscovery of the First Presbyterian Sham Plot' was published in the\nsame year; and from that time nothing further is known of Andrew\nYarranton.  His name and his writings have been alike nearly forgotten;\nand, though Bishop Watson declared of him that he deserved to have a\nstatue erected to his memory as a great public benefactor, we do not\nknow that he was so much as honoured with a tombstone; for we have been\nunable, after careful inquiry, to discover when and where he died.\n\nYarranton was a man whose views were far in advance of his age.  The\ngeneration for whom he laboured and wrote were not ripe for their\nreception and realization; and his voice sounded among the people like\nthat of one crying in the wilderness.  But though his exhortations to\nindustry and his large plans of national improvement failed to work\nthemselves into realities in his own time, he broke the ground, he\nsowed the seed, and it may be that even at this day we are in some\ndegree reaping the results of his labours.  At all events, his books\nstill live to show how wise and sagacious Andrew Yarranton was beyond\nhis contemporaries as to the true methods of establishing upon solid\nfoundations the industrial prosperity of England.\n\n\n\n[1] PATRICK EDWARD DOVE, Elements of Political Science.  Edinburgh,\n1854.\n\n[2] A copy of the entries in the parish register relating to the\nvarious members of the Yarranton family, kindly forwarded to us by the\nRev. H. W. Cookes, rector of Astley, shows them to have resided in that\nparish for many generations.  There were the Yarrantons of Yarranton,\nof Redstone, of Larford, of Brockenton, and of Longmore.  With that\ndisregard for orthography in proper names which prevailed some three\nhundred years since, they are indifferently designated as Yarran,\nYarranton, and Yarrington.  The name was most probably derived from two\nfarms named Great and Little Yarranton, or Yarran (originally\nYarhampton), situated in the parish of Astley.  The Yarrantons\nfrequently filled local offices in that parish, and we find several of\nthem officiating at different periods as bailiffs of Bewdley.\n\n[3] Journals of the House of Commons, 1st July, 1648.\n\n[4] YARRANTON'S England's Improvement by Sea and Land.

He\nconstructed five out of the six locks, and then abandoned the scheme.\nGough, in his edition of Camden's Brit. ii. 357, Lond. 1789, says, \"It\nis not long since some of the boats made use of in Yarranton's\nnavigation were found.  Neither tradition nor our projector's account\nof the matter perfectly satisfy us why this navigation was\nneglected.....  We must therefore conclude that the numerous works and\nglass-houses upon the Stour, and in the neighbourhood of Stourbridge,\ndid not then exist, A.D. 1666.  ....The navigable communication which\nnow connects Trent and Severn, and which runs in the course of\nYarranton's project, is already of general use....

They were Sir Waiter\nKirtham Blount, Bart., Sir Samuel Baldwin and Sir Timothy Baldwin,\nKnights, Thomas Foley and Philip Foley, Esquires, and six other\ngentlemen.  The father of the Foleys was himself supposed to have\nintroduced the art of iron-splitting into England by an expedient\nsimilar to that adopted by Yarranton in obtaining a knowledge of the\ntin-plate manufacture (Self-Help, p.145).  The secret of the\nsilk-throwing machinery of Piedmont was in like manner introduced into\nEngland by Mr. Lombe of Derby, who shortly succeeded in founding a\nflourishing branch of manufacture.  These were indeed the days of\nromance and adventure in manufactures.\n\n[14] The district is known as the Erzgebirge or Ore Mountains, and the\nRiesengebirge or Giant Mountains, MacCulloch says that upwards of 500\nmines are wrought in the former district, and that one-thirtieth of the\nentire population of Saxony to this day derive their subsistence from\nmining industry and the manufacture of metallic products.--\nGeographical Dict. ii. 643, edit. 1854.\n\n[15] Chamberlaine and Dudley's first licence was granted in 1661 for\nplating steel and tinning the said plates; and Chamberlaine's sole\npatent for \"plating and tinning iron, copper, &c.,\" was granted in\n1673, probably the patent in question.\n\n[16] JOHN CHAMBERS, Biographical Illustrations of Worcestershire.\nLondon, 1820.\n\n[17] Yarranton's Land Bank was actually projected in 1695, and received\nthe sanction of Parliament; though the Bank of England (founded in the\npreceding year) petitioned against it, and the scheme was dropped.\n\n[18] It is interesting to note in passing, that part of Yarranton's\nscheme has recently been carried into effect by the Act (25 and 26\nVict. c. 53) passed in 1862 for the Registration of Real Estate.\n\n[19] One of these is entitled 'A Coffee-house Dialogue, or a Discourse\nbetween Captain Y---- and a Young Barrister of the Middle Temple; with\nsome Reflections upon the Bill against the D. of Y.' In this broadside,\nof 3 1/2 pages folio, published about 1679, Yarranton is made to favour\nthe Duke of York's exclusion from the throne, not only because he was a\npapist, but for graver reasons than he dare express.  Another\nscurrilous pamphlet, entitled 'A Word Without Doors,' was also aimed at\nhim.  Yarranton, or his friends, replied to the first attack in a folio\nof two pages, entitled 'The Coffee-house Dialogue Examined and Refuted,\nby some Neighbours in the Country, well-wishers to the Kingdom's\ninterest.' The controversy was followed up by 'A Continuation of the\nCoffee-house Dialogue,' in which the chief interlocutor hits Yarranton\nrather hard for the miscarriage of his \"improvements.\"  \"I know,\" says\nhe, \"when and where you undertook for a small charge to make a river\nnavigable, and it has cost the proprietors about six times as much, and\nis not yet effective; nor can any man rationally predict when it will\nbe.  I know since you left it your son undertook it, and this winter\nshamefully left his undertaking.\"  Yarranton's friends immediately\nreplied in a four-page folio, entitled 'England's Improvements\nJustified; and the Author thereof, Captain Y., vindicated from the\nScandals in a paper called a Coffee-house Dialogue; with some\nAnimadversions upon the Popish Designs therein contained.' The writer\nsays he writes without the privity or sanction of Yarranton, but\ndeclares the dialogue to be a forgery, and that the alleged conference\nnever took place.  \"His innocence, when he heard of it, only provoked a\nsmile, with this answer, Spreta vilescunt, falsehoods mu st perish, and\nare soonest destroyed by contempt; so that he needs no further\nvindication.  The writer then proceeds at some length to vindicate the\nCaptain's famous work and the propositions contained in it.\n\n[20] This work (especially with the plates) is excessively rare.  There\nis a copy of it in perfect condition in the Grenville Library, British\nMuseum.\n\n[21] Dr. Nash, in his History of Worcestershire, has thrown some doubts\nupon this story; but Mr. Green, in his Historical Antiquities of the\ncity, has made a most able defence of Yarranton's statement (vol.i.  9,\nin foot-note).\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nCOALBROOKDALE IRON WORKS--THE DARBYS AND REYNOLDSES.\n\n\"The triumph of the industrial arts will advance the cause of\ncivilization more rapidly than its warmest advocates could have hoped,\nand contribute to the permanent prosperity and strength of the country\nfar move than the most splendid victories of successful war.\"--C.\nBABBAGE, The Exposition of 1851.\n\n\nDud Dudley's invention of smelting iron with coke made of pit-coal was,\nlike many others, born before its time.  It was neither appreciated by\nthe iron-masters nor by the workmen.  All schemes for smelting ore with\nany other fuel than charcoal made from wood were regarded with\nincredulity.  As for Dudley's Metallum Martis, as it contained no\nspecification, it revealed no secret; and when its author died, his\nsecret, whatever it might be, died with him.  Other improvements were\ndoubtless necessary before the invention could be turned to useful\naccount.  Thus, until a more powerful blowing-furnace had been\ncontrived, the production of pit-coal iron must necessarily have been\nlimited.  Dudley himself does not seem to have been able to make more\non an average than five tons a-week, and seven tons at the outside.\nNor was the iron so good as that made by charcoal; for it is admitted\nto have been especially liable to deterioration by the sulphureous\nfumes of the coal in the process of manufacture.\n\nDr. Plot, in his 'History of Staffordshire,' speaks of an experiment\nmade by one Dr. Blewstone, a High German, as \"the last effort\" made in\nthat county to smelt iron-ore with pit-coal.  He is said to have \"built\nhis furnace at Wednesbury, so ingeniously contrived (that only the\nflame of the coal should come to the ore, with several other\nconveniences), that many were of opinion he would succeed in it.  But\nexperience, that great baffler of speculation, showed it would not be;\nthe sulphureous vitriolic steams that issue from the pyrites, which\nfrequently, if not always, accompanies pit-coal, ascending with the\nflame, and poisoning the ore sufficiently to make it render much worse\niron than that made with charcoal, though not perhaps so much worse as\nthe body of the coal itself would possibly do.\" [1]  Dr. Plot does not\ngive the year in which this \"last effort\" was made; but as we find that\none Dr. Frederic de Blewston obtained a patent from Charles II. on the\n25th October, 1677, for \"a new and effectual way of melting down,\nforging, extracting, and reducing of iron and all metals and minerals\nwith pit-coal and sea-coal, as well and effectually as ever hath yet\nbeen done by charcoal, and with much less charge;\" and as Dr. Plot's\nHistory, in which he makes mention of the experiment and its failure,\nwas published in 1686, it is obvious that the trial must have been made\nbetween those years.\n\nAs the demand for iron steadily increased with the increasing\npopulation of the country, and as the supply of timber for smelting\npurposes was diminishing from year to year, England was compelled to\nrely more and more upon foreign countries for its supply of\nmanufactured iron.  The number of English forges rapidly dwindled, and\nthe amount of the home production became insignificant in comparison\nwith what was imported from abroad.  Yarranton, writing in 1676, speaks\nof \"the many iron-works laid down in Kent, Sussex, Surrey, and in the\nnorth of England, because the iron of Sweadland, Flanders, and Spain,\ncoming in so cheap, it cannot be made to profit here.\"  There were many\npersons, indeed, who held that it was better we should be supplied with\niron from Spain than make it at home, in consequence of the great waste\nof wood involved by the manufacture; but against this view Yarranton\nstrongly contended, and held, what is as true now as it was then, that\nthe manufacture of iron was the keystone of England's industrial\nprosperity.  He also apprehended great danger to the country from want\nof iron in event of the contingency of a foreign war.  \"When the\ngreatest part of the iron-works are asleep,\" said he, \"if there should\nbe occasion for great quantities of guns and bullets, and other sorts\nof iron commodities, for a present unexpected war, and the Sound happen\nto be locked up, and so prevent iron coming to us, truly we should then\nbe in a fine case!\"\n\nNotwithstanding these apprehended national perils arising from the want\nof iron, no steps seem to have been taken to supply the deficiency,\neither by planting woods on a large scale, as recommended by Yarranton,\nor by other methods; and the produce of English iron continued steadily\nto decline.  In 1720-30 there were found only ten furnaces remaining in\nblast in the whole Forest of Dean, where the iron-smelters were\nsatisfied with working up merely the cinders left by the Romans.  A\nwriter of the time states that we then bought between two and three\nhundred thousand pounds' worth of foreign iron yearly, and that England\nwas the best customer in Europe for Swedish and Russian iron.[2]  By\nthe middle of the eighteenth century the home manufacture had so much\nfallen off, that the total production of Great Britain is supposed to\nhave amounted to not more than 18,000 tons a year; four-fifths of the\niron used in the country being imported from Sweden.[3]\n\nThe more that the remaining ironmasters became straitened for want of\nwood, the more they were compelled to resort to cinders and coke made\nfrom coal as a substitute.  And it was found that under certain\ncircumstances this fuel answered the purpose almost as well as charcoal\nof wood.  The coke was made by burning the coal in heaps in the open\nair, and it was usually mixed with coal and peat in the process of\nsmelting the ore.  Coal by itself was used by the country smiths for\nforging whenever they could procure it for their smithy fires; and in\nthe midland counties they had it brought to them, sometimes from great\ndistances, slung in bags across horses' backs,--for the state of the\nroads was then so execrable as not to admit of its being led for any\nconsiderable distance in carts.  At length we arrive at a period when\ncoal seems to have come into general use, and when necessity led to its\nregular employment both in smelting the ore and in manufacturing the\nmetal.  And this brings us to the establishment of the Coalbrookdale\nworks, where the smelting of iron by means of coke and coal was first\nadopted on a large scale as the regular method of manufacture.\n\nAbraham Darby, the first of a succession of iron manufacturers who bore\nthe same name, was the son of a farmer residing at Wrensnest, near\nDudley.  He served an apprenticeship to a maker of malt-kilns near\nBirmingham, after which he married and removed to Bristol in 1700, to\nbegin business on his own account.  Industry is of all politics and\nreligions:  thus Dudley was a Royalist and a Churchman, Yarranton was a\nParliamentarian and a Presbyterian, and Abraham Darby was a Quaker.  At\nBristol he was joined by three partners of the same persuasion, who\nprovided the necessary capital to enable him to set up works at Baptist\nMills, near that city, where he carried on the business of malt-mill\nmaking, to which he afterwards added brass and iron founding.\n\nAt that period cast-iron pots were in very general use, forming the\nprincipal cooking utensils of the working class.  The art of casting\nhad, however, made such small progress in England that the pots were\nfor the most part imported from abroad.  Darby resolved, if possible,\nto enter upon this lucrative branch of manufacture; and he proceeded to\nmake a number of experiments in pot-making.  Like others who had\npreceded him, he made his first moulds of clay; but they cracked and\nburst, and one trial failed after another.  He then determined to find\nout the true method of manufacturing the pots, by travelling into the\ncountry from whence the best were imported, in order to master the\ngrand secret of the trade.  With this object he went over to Holland in\nthe year 1706, and after diligent inquiry he ascertained that the only\nsure method of casting \"Hilton ware,\" as such castings were then\ncalled, was in moulds of fine dry sand.  This was the whole secret.\n\nReturning to Bristol, accompanied by some skilled Dutch workmen, Darby\nbegan the new manufacture, and succeeded to his satisfaction.  The work\nwas at first carried on with great secrecy, lest other makers should\ncopy the art; and the precaution was taken of stopping the keyhole of\nthe workshop-door while the casting was in progress.  To secure himself\nagainst piracy, he proceeded to take out a patent for the process in\nthe year 1708, and it was granted for the term of fourteen years.  The\nrecital of the patent is curious, as showing the backward state of\nEnglish iron-founding at that time.  It sets forth that \"whereas our\ntrusty and well-beloved Abraham Darby, of our city of Bristol, smith,\nhath by his petition humbly represented to us, that by his study,\nindustry, and expense, he hath found out and brought to perfection a\nnew way of casting iron bellied pots and other iron bellied ware in\nsand only, without loam or clay, by which such iron pots and other ware\nmay be cast fine and with more ease and expedition, and may be afforded\ncheaper than they can be by the way commonly used; and in regard to\ntheir cheapness may be of great advantage to the poor of this our\nkingdom, who for the most part use such ware, and in all probability\nwill prevent the merchants of England going to foreign markets for such\nware, from whence great quantities are imported, and likewise may in\ntime supply other markets with that manufacture of our dominions,\n&c..... grants the said Abraham Darby the full power and sole privilege\nto make and sell such pots and ware for and during the term of fourteen\nyears thence ensuing.\"\n\nDarby proceeded to make arrangements for carrying on the manufacture\nupon a large scale at the Baptist Mills; but the other partners\nhesitated to embark more capital in the concern, and at length refused\ntheir concurrence.  Determined not to be baulked in his enterprise,\nDarby abandoned the Bristol firm; and in the year 1709 he removed to\nCoalbrookdale in Shropshire, with the intention of prosecuting the\nenterprise on his own account.  He took the lease of a little furnace\nwhich had existed at the place for more than a century, as the records\nexist of a \"smethe\" or \"smeth-house\" at Coalbrookdale in the time of\nthe Tudors.  The woods of oak and hazel which at that time filled the\nbeautiful dingles of the dale, and spread in almost a continuous forest\nto the base of the Wrekin, furnished abundant fuel for the smithery.\nAs the trade of the Coalbrookdale firm extended, these woods became\ncleared, until the same scarcity of fuel began to be experienced that\nhad already desolated the forests of Sussex, and brought the\nmanufacture of iron in that quarter to a stand-still.\n\nIt appears from the 'Blast Furnace Memorandum Book' of Abraham Darby,\nwhich we have examined, that the make of iron at the Coalbrookdale\nfoundry, in 1713, varied from five to ten tons a week.  The principal\narticles cast were pots, kettles, and other \"hollow ware,\" direct from\nthe smelting-furnace; the rest of the metal was run into pigs.  In\ncourse of time we find that other castings were turned out:  a few\ngrates, smoothing-irons, door-frames, weights, baking-plates,\ncart-bushes, iron pestles and mortars, and occasionally a tailor's\ngoose.  The trade gradually increased, until we find as many as 150\npots and kettles cast in a week.\n\nThe fuel used in the furnaces appears, from the Darby Memorandum-Book,\nto have been at first entirely charcoal; but the growing scarcity of\nwood seems to have gradually led to the use of coke, brays or small\ncoke, and peat.  An abundance of coals existed in the neighbourhood: by\nrejecting those of inferior quality, and coking the others with great\ncare, a combustible was obtained better fitted even than charcoal\nitself for the fusion of that particular kind of ore which is found in\nthe coal-measures.  Thus we find Darby's most favourite charge for his\nfurnaces to have been five baskets of coke, two of brays, and one of\npeat; next followed the ore, and then the limestone.  The use of\ncharcoal was gradually given up as the art of smelting with coke and\nbrays improved, most probably aided by the increased power of the\nfurnace-blast, until at length we find it entirely discontinued.\n\nThe castings of Coalbrookdale gradually acquired a reputation, and the\ntrade of Abraham Darby continued to increase until the date of his\ndeath, which occurred at Madeley Court in 1717.  His sons were too\nyoung at the time to carry on the business which he had so successfully\nstarted, and several portions of the works were sold at a serious\nsacrifice.  But when the sons had grown up to manhood, they too entered\nupon the business of iron-founding; and Abraham Darby's son and\ngrandson, both of the same name, largely extended the operations of the\nfirm, until Coalbrookdale, or, as it was popularly called, \"Bedlam,\"\nbecame the principal seat of one of the most important branches of the\niron trade.\n\nThere seems to be some doubt as to the precise time when pit-coal was\nfirst regularly employed at Coalbrookdale in smelting the ore.  Mr.\nScrivenor says, \"pit-coal was first used by Mr. Abraham Darby, in his\nfurnace at Coalbrookdale, in 1713;\" [4] but we can find no confirmation\nof this statement in the records of the Company.  It is probable that\nMr. Darby used raw coal, as was done in the Forest of Dean at the same\ntime,[5] in the process of calcining the ore; but it would appear from\nhis own Memoranda that coke only was used in the process of smelting.\nWe infer from other circumstances that pit-coal was not employed for\nthe latter purpose until a considerably later period.  The merit of its\nintroduction, and its successful use in iron-smelting, is due to Mr.\nRichard Ford, who had married a daughter of Abraham Darby, and managed\nthe Coalbrookdale works in 1747.  In a paper by the Rev. Mr. Mason,\nWoodwardian Professor at Cambridge, given in the 'Philosophical\nTransactions' for that year,[6] the first account of its successful\nemployment is stated as follows:--\"Several attempts have been made to\nrun iron-ore with pit-coal:  he (Mr. Mason) thinks it has not succeeded\nanywhere, as we have had no account of its being practised; but Mr.\nFord, of Coalbrookdale in Shropshire, from iron-ore and coal, both got\nin the same dale, makes iron brittle or tough as he pleases, there\nbeing cannon thus cast so soft as to bear turning like wrought-iron.\"\nMost probably, however, it was not until the time of Richard Reynolds,\nwho succeeded Abraham Darby the second in the management of the works\nin 1757, that pit-coal came into large and regular use in the\nblasting-furnaces as well as the fineries of Coalbrookdale.\n\nRichard Reynolds was born at Bristol in 1735.  His parents, like the\nDarbys, belonged to the Society of Friends, and he was educated in that\npersuasion.  Being a spirited, lively youth, the \"old Adam\"\noccasionally cropped out in him; and he is even said, when a young man,\nto have been so much fired by the heroism of the soldier's character\nthat he felt a strong desire to embrace a military career; but this\nfeeling soon died out, and he dropped into the sober and steady rut of\nthe Society.  After serving an apprenticeship in his native town, he\nwas sent to Coalbrookdale on a mission of business, where he became\nacquainted with the Darby family, and shortly after married Hannah, the\ndaughter of Abraham the second.  He then entered upon the conduct of\nthe iron and coal works at Ketley and Horsehay, where he resided for\nsix years, removing to Coalbrookdale in 1763, to take charge of the\nworks there, on the death of his father-in-law.\n\nBy the exertions and enterprise of the Darbys, the Coalbrookdale Works\nhad become greatly enlarged, giving remunerative employment to a large\nand increasing population.  The firm had extended their operations far\nbeyond the boundaries of the Dale:  they had established foundries at\nLondon, Bristol, and Liverpool, and agencies at Newcastle and Truro for\nthe disposal of steam-engines and other iron machinery used in the deep\nmines of those districts.  Watt had not yet perfected his steam-engine;\nbut there was a considerable demand for pumping-engines of Newcomen's\nconstruction, many of which were made at the Coalbrookdale Works.  The\nincreasing demand for iron gave an impetus to coal-mining, which in its\nturn stimulated inventors in their improvement of the power of the\nsteam-engine; for the coal could not be worked quickly and\nadvantageously unless the pits could be kept clear of water.  Thus one\ninvention stimulates another; and when the steam-engine had been\nperfected by Watt, and enabled powerful-blowing apparatus to be worked\nby its agency, we shall find that the production of iron by means of\npit-coal being rendered cheap and expeditious, soon became enormously\nincreased.\n\nWe are informed that it was while Richard Reynolds had charge of the\nCoalbrookdale works that a further important improvement was effected\nin the manufacture of iron by pit-coal.  Up to this time the conversion\nof crude or cast iron into malleable or bar iron had been effected\nentirely by means of charcoal.  The process was carried on in a fire\ncalled a finery, somewhat like that of a smith's forge; the iron being\nexposed to the blast of powerful bellows, and in constant contact with\nthe fuel.  In the first process of fusing the ironstone, coal had been\nused for some time with increasing success; but the question arose,\nwhether coal might not also be used with effect in the second or\nrefining stage.  Two of the foremen, named Cranege, suggested to Mr.\nReynolds that this might be performed in what is called a reverberatory\nfurnace,[7] in which the iron should not mix with the coal, but be\nheated solely by the flame.  Mr. Reynolds greatly doubted the\nfeasibility of the operation, but he authorized the Cranege, to make an\nexperiment of their process, the result of which will be found\ndescribed in the following extract of a letter from Mr. Reynolds to Mr.\nThomas Goldney of Bristol, dated \"Coalbrookdale, 25th April, 1766\":--\n\n.... \"I come now to what I think a matter of very great consequence.\nIt is some time since Thos. Cranege, who works at Bridgenorth Forge,\nand his brother George, of the Dale, spoke to me about a notion they\nhad conceived of making bar iron without wood charcoal.  I told them,\nconsistent with the notion I had adopted in common with all others I\nhad conversed with, that I thought it impossible, because the vegetable\nsalts in the charcoal being an alkali acted as an absorbent to the\nsulphur of the iron, which occasions the red-short quality of the iron,\nand pit coal abounding with sulphur would increase it.  This specious\nanswer, which would probably have appeared conclusive to most, and\nwhich indeed was what I really thought, was not so to them.  They\nreplied that from the observations they had made, and repeated\nconversations together, they were both firmly of opinion that the\nalteration from the quality of pig iron into that of bar iron was\neffected merely by heat, and if I would give them leave, they would\nmake a trial some day.  I consented, but, I confess, without any great\nexpectation of their success; and so the matter rested some weeks, when\nit happening that some repairs had to be done at Bridgenorth, Thomas\ncame up to the Dale, and, with his brother, made a trial in Thos.\nTilly's air-furnace with such success as I thought would justify the\nerection of a small air-furnace at the Forge for the more perfectly\nascertaining the merit of the invention.  This was accordingly done,\nand a trial of it has been made this week, and the success has\nsurpassed the most sanguine expectations.  The iron put into the\nfurnace was old Bushes, which thou knowest are always made of hard\niron, and the iron drawn out is the toughest I ever saw.  A bar 1 1/4\ninch square, when broke, appears to have very little cold short in it.\nI look upon it as one of the most important discoveries ever made, and\ntake the liberty of recommending thee and earnestly requesting thou\nwouldst take out a patent for it immediately....  The specification of\nthe invention will be comprised in a few words, as it will only set\nforth that a reverberatory furnace being built of a proper\nconstruction, the pig or cast iron is put into it, and without the\naddition of anything else than common raw pit coal, is converted into\ngood malleable iron, and, being taken red-hot from the reverberatory\nfurnace to the forge hammer, is drawn out into bars of various shapes\nand sizes, according to the will of the workmen.\"\n\nMr. Reynolds's advice was implicitly followed.  A patent was secured in\nthe name of the brothers Cranege, dated the 17th June, 1766; and the\nidentical words in the above letter were adopted in the specification\nas descriptive of the process.  By this method of puddling, as it is\ntermed, the manufacturer was thenceforward enabled to produce iron in\nincreased quantity at a large reduction in price; and though the\ninvention of the Craneges was greatly improved upon by Onions, and\nsubsequently by Cort, there can be no doubt as to the originality and\nthe importance of their invention.  Mr. Tylor states that he was\ninformed by the son of Richard Reynolds that the wrought iron made at\nCoalbrookdale by the Cranege process \"was very good, quite tough, and\nbroke with a long, bright, fibrous fracture:  that made by Cort\nafterwards was quite different.\" [8]  Though Mr. Reynolds's generosity\nto the Craneges is apparent; in the course which he adopted in securing\nfor them a patent for the invention in their own names, it does not\nappear to have proved of much advantage to them; and they failed to\nrise above the rank which they occupied when their valuable discovery\nwas patented.  This, however, was no fault of Richard Reynolds, but was\nmainly attributable to the circumstance of other inventions in a great\nmeasure superseding their process, and depriving them of the benefits\nof their ingenuity.\n\nAmong the important improvements introduced by Mr. Reynolds while\nmanaging the Coalbrookdale Works, was the adoption by him for the first\ntime of iron instead of wooden rails in the tram-roads along which coal\nand iron were conveyed from one part of the works to another, as well\nas to the loading-places along the river Severn.  He observed that the\nwooden rails soon became decayed, besides being liable to be broken by\nthe heavy loads passing over them, occasioning much loss of time,\ninterruption to business, and heavy expenses in repairs.  It occurred\nto him that these inconveniences would be obviated by the use of rails\nof cast-iron; and, having tried an experiment with them, it answered so\nwell, that in 1767 the whole of the wooden rails were taken up and\nreplaced by rails of iron.  Thus was the era of iron railroads fairly\ninitiated at Coalbrookdale, and the example of Mr. Reynolds was shortly\nafter followed on all the tramroads throughout the Country.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that the first iron bridge ever erected was\ncast and made at the Coalbrookdale Works--its projection as well as its\nerection being mainly due to the skill and enterprise of Abraham Darby\nthe third.  When but a young man, he showed indications of that\nsagacity and energy in business which seemed to be hereditary in his\nfamily.  One of the first things he did on arriving at man's estate was\nto set on foot a scheme for throwing a bridge across the Severn at\nCoalbrookdale, at a point where the banks were steep and slippery, to\naccommodate the large population which had sprung up along both banks\nof the river.  There were now thriving iron, brick, and pottery works\nestablished in the parishes of Madeley and Broseley; and the old ferry\non the Severn was found altogether inadequate for ready communication\nbetween one bank and the other.  The want of a bridge had long been\nfelt, and a plan of one had been prepared during the life time of\nAbraham Darby the second; but the project was suspended at his death.\nWhen his son came of age, he resolved to take up his father's dropped\nscheme, and prosecute it to completion, which he did.  Young Mr. Darby\nbecame lord of the manor of Madeley in 1776, and was the owner of\none-half of the ferry in right of his lordship.  He was so fortunate as\nto find the owner of the other or Broseley half of the ferry equally\nanxious with himself to connect the two banks of the river by means of\na bridge.  The necessary powers were accordingly obtained from\nParliament, and a bridge was authorized to be built \"of cast-iron,\nstone, brick, or timber.\"  A company was formed for the purpose of\ncarrying out the project, and the shares were taken by the adjoining\nowners, Abraham Darby being the principal subscriber.[9]\n\nThe construction of a bridge of iron was an entirely new idea.  An\nattempt had indeed been made at Lyons, in France, to construct such a\nbridge more than twenty years before; but it had entirely failed, and a\nbridge of timber was erected instead.  It is not known whether the\nCoalbrookdale masters had heard of that attempt; but, even if they had,\nit could have been of no practical use to them.\n\nMr. Pritchard, an architect of Shrewsbury, was first employed to\nprepare a design of the intended structure, which is still preserved.\nAlthough Mr. Pritchard proposed to introduce cast-iron in the arch of\nthe bridge, which was to be of 120 feet span, it was only as a sort of\nkey, occupying but a few feet at the crown of the arch.  This sparing\nuse of cast iron indicates the timidity of the architect in dealing\nwith the new material--his plan exhibiting a desire to effect a\ncompromise between the tried and the untried in bridge-construction.\nBut the use of iron to so limited an extent, and in such a part of the\nstructure, was of more than questionable utility; and if Mr.\nPritchard's plan had been adopted, the problem of the iron bridge would\nstill have remained unsolved.\n\nThe plan, however, after having been duly considered, was eventually\nset aside, and another, with the entire arch of cast-iron, was prepared\nunder the superintendence of Abraham Darby, by Mr. Thomas Gregory, his\nforeman of pattern-makers.  This plan was adopted, and arrangements\nwere forthwith made for carrying it into effect.  The abutments of the\nbridge were built in 1777-8, during which the castings were made at the\nfoundry, and the ironwork was successfully erected in the course of\nthree months.  The bridge was opened for traffic in 1779, and proved a\nmost serviceable structure.  In 1788 the Society of Arts recognised Mr.\nDarby's merit as its designer and erector by presenting him with their\ngold medal; and the model of the bridge is still to be seen in the\ncollection of the Society.  Mr. Robert Stephenson has said of the\nstructure:  \"If we consider that the manipulation of cast-iron was then\ncompletely in its infancy, a bridge of such dimensions was doubtless a\nbold as well as an original undertaking, and the efficiency of the\ndetails is worthy of the boldness of the conception.\" [10]  Mr.\nStephenson adds that from a defect in the construction the abutments\nwere thrust inwards at the approaches and the ribs partially fractured.\nWe are, however, informed that this is a mistake, though it does appear\nthat the apprehension at one time existed that such an accident might\npossibly occur.\n\nTo remedy the supposed defect, two small land arches were, in the year\n1800, substituted for the stone approach on the Broseley side of the\nbridge.  While the work was in progress, Mr. Telford, the well-known\nengineer, carefully examined the bridge, and thus spoke of its\ncondition at the time:--\"The great improvement of erecting upon a\nnavigable river a bridge of cast-iron of one arch only was first put in\npractice near Coalbrookdale.  The bridge was executed in 1777 by Mr.\nAbraham Darby, and the ironwork is now quite as perfect as when it was\nfirst put up.  Drawings of this bridge have long been before the\npublic, and have been much and justly admired.\" [11]  A Coalbrookdale\ncorrespondent, writing in May, 1862, informs us that \"at the present\ntime the bridge is undergoing repair; and, special examination having\nbeen made, there is no appearance either that the abutments have moved,\nor that the ribs have been broken in the centre or are out of their\nproper right line.  There has, it is true, been a strain on the land\narches, and on the roadway plates, which, however, the main arch has\nbeen able effectually to resist.\"\n\nThe bridge has now been in profitable daily use for upwards of eighty\nyears, and has during that time proved of the greatest convenience to\nthe population of the district.  So judicious was the selection of its\nsite, and so great its utility, that a thriving town of the name of\nIronbridge has grown up around it upon what, at the time of its\nerection, was a nameless part of \"the waste of the manor of Madeley.\"\nAnd it is probable that the bridge will last for centuries to come.\nThus, also, was the use of iron as an important material in\nbridge-building fairly initiated at Coalbrookdale by Abraham Darby, as\nthe use of iron rails was by Richard Reynolds.  We need scarcely add\nthat since the invention and extensive adoption of railway locomotion,\nthe employment of iron in various forms in railway and bridge\nstructures has rapidly increased, until iron has come to be regarded as\nthe very sheet-anchor of the railway engineer.\n\nIn the mean time the works at Coalbrookdale had become largely\nextended.  In 1784, when the government of the day proposed to levy a\ntax on pit-coal, Richard Reynolds strongly urged upon Mr. Pitt, then\nChancellor of the Exchequer, as well as on Lord Gower, afterwards\nMarquis of Stafford, the impolicy of such a tax.  To the latter he\nrepresented that large capitals had been invested in the iron trade,\nwhich was with difficulty carried on in the face of the competition\nwith Swedish and Russian iron.  At Coalbrookdale, sixteen \"fire\nengines,\" as steam engines were first called, were then at work, eight\nblast-furnaces and nine forges, besides the air furnaces and mills at\nthe foundry, which, with the levels, roads, and more than twenty miles\nof iron railways, gave employment to a very large number of people.\n\"The advancement of the iron trade within these few years,\" said he,\n\"has been prodigious.  It was thought, and justly, that the making of\npig-iron with pit coal was a great acquisition to the country by saving\nthe wood and supplying a material to manufactures, the production of\nwhich, by the consumption of all the wood the country produced, was\nformerly unequal to the demand, and the nail trade, perhaps the most\nconsiderable of any one article of manufactured iron, would have been\nlost to this country had it not been found practicable to make nails of\niron made with pit coal.  We have now another process to attempt, and\nthat is to make BAR IRON with pit coal; and it is for that purpose we\nhave made, or rather are making, alterations at Donnington Wood,\nKetley, and elsewhere, which we expect to complete in the present year,\nbut not at a less expense than twenty thousand pounds, which will be\nlost to us, and gained by nobody, if this tax is laid upon our coals.\"\nHe would not, however, have it understood that he sought for any\nPROTECTION for the homemade iron, notwithstanding the lower prices of\nthe foreign article.  \"From its most imperfect state as pig-iron,\" he\nobserved to Lord Sheffield, \"to its highest finish in the regulating\nsprings of a watch, we have nothing to fear if the importation into\neach country should be permitted without duty.\"  We need scarcely add\nthat the subsequent history of the iron trade abundantly justified\nthese sagacious anticipations of Richard Reynolds.\n\nHe was now far advanced in years.  His business had prospered, his\nmeans were ample, and he sought retirement.  He did not desire to\npossess great wealth, which in his opinion entailed such serious\nresponsibilities upon its possessor; and he held that the accumulation\nof large property was more to be deprecated than desired.  He therefore\ndetermined to give up his shares in the ironworks at Ketley to his sons\nWilliam and Joseph, who continued to carry them on.  William was a man\nof eminent ability, well versed in science, and an excellent mechanic.\nHe introduced great improvements in the working of the coal and iron\nmines, employing new machinery for the purpose, and availing himself\nwith much ingenuity of the discoveries then being made in the science\nof chemistry.  He was also an inventor, having been the first to employ\n(in 1788) inclined planes, consisting of parallel railways, to connect\nand work canals of different levels,--an invention erroneously\nattributed to Fulton, but which the latter himself acknowledged to\nbelong to William Reynolds.  In the first chapter of his 'Treatise on\nCanal Navigation,' published in 1796, Fulton says:--\"As local\nprejudices opposed the Duke of Bridgewater's canal in the first\ninstance, prejudices equally strong as firmly adhered to the principle\non which it was constructed; and it was thought impossible to lead one\nthrough a country, or to work it to any advantage, unless by locks and\nboats of at least twenty-five tons, till the genius of Mr. William\nReynolds, of Ketley, in Shropshire, stepped from the accustomed path,\nconstructed the first inclined plane, and introduced boats of five\ntons.  This, like the Duke's canal, was deemed a visionary project, and\nparticularly by his Grace, who was partial to locks; yet this is also\nintroduced into practice, and will in many instances supersede lock\ncanals.\"  Telford, the engineer, also gracefully acknowledged the\nvaluable assistance he received from William Reynolds in planning the\niron aqueduct by means of which the Ellesmere Canal was carried over\nthe Pont Cysylltau, and in executing the necessary castings for the\npurpose at the Ketley foundry.\n\nThe future management of his extensive ironworks being thus placed in\nable hands, Richard Reynolds finally left Coalbrookdale in 1804, for\nBristol, his native town, where he spent the remainder of his life in\nworks of charity and mercy.  Here we might leave the subject, but\ncannot refrain from adding a few concluding words as to the moral\ncharacteristics of this truly good man.  Though habitually religious,\nhe was neither demure nor morose, but cheerful, gay, and humorous.  He\ntook great interest in the pleasures of the young people about him, and\nexerted himself in all ways to promote their happiness.  He was fond of\nbooks, pictures, poetry, and music, though the indulgence of artistic\ntastes is not thought becoming in the Society to which he belonged.\nHis love for the beauties of nature amounted almost to a passion, and\nwhen living at The Bank, near Ketley, it was his great delight in the\nsummer evenings to retire with his pipe to a rural seat commanding a\nfull view of the Wrekin, the Ercall Woods, with Cader Idris and the\nMontgomeryshire hills in the distance, and watch the sun go down in the\nwest in his glory.  Once in every year he assembled a large party to\nspend a day with him on the Wrekin, and amongst those invited were the\nprincipal clerks in the company's employment, together with their\nfamilies.  At Madeley, near Coalbrookdale, where he bought a property,\nhe laid out, for the express use of the workmen, extensive walks\nthrough the woods on Lincoln Hill, commanding beautiful views.  They\nwere called \"The Workmen's Walks,\" and were a source of great enjoyment\nto them and their families, especially on Sunday afternoons.\n\nWhen Mr. Reynolds went to London on business, he was accustomed to make\na round of visits, on his way home, to places remarkable for their\npicturesque beauty, such as Stowe, Hagley Park, and the Leasowes.\nAfter a visit to the latter place in 1767, he thus, in a letter to his\nfriend John Maccappen, vindicated his love for the beautiful in\nnature:--\"I think it not only lawful but expedient to cultivate a\ndisposition to be pleased with the beauties of nature, by frequent\nindulgences for that purpose.  The mind, by being continually applied\nto the consideration of ways and means to gain money, contracts an\nindifferency if not an insensibility to the profusion of beauties which\nthe benevolent Creator has impressed upon every part of the material\ncreation.  A sordid love of gold, the possession of what gold can\npurchase, and the reputation of being rich, have so depraved the finer\nfeelings of some men, that they pass through the most delightful grove,\nfilled with the melody of nature, or listen to the murmurings of the\nbrook in the valley, with as little pleasure and with no more of the\nvernal delight which Milton describes, than they feel in passing\nthrough some obscure alley in a town.\"\n\nWhen in the prime of life, Mr. Reynolds was an excellent rider,\nperforming all his journeys on horseback.  He used to give a ludicrous\naccount of a race he once ran with another youth, each having a lady\nseated on a pillion behind him; Mr. Reynolds reached the goal first,\nbut when he looked round he found that he had lost his fair companion,\nwho had fallen off in the race! On another occasion he had a hard run\nwith Lord Thurlow during a visit paid by the latter to the Ketley\nIron-Works.  Lord Thurlow pulled up his horse first, and observed,\nlaughing, \"I think, Mr. Reynolds, this is probably the first time that\never a Lord Chancellor rode a race with a Quaker!\" But a stranger\nrencontre was one which befel Mr. Reynolds on Blackheath.  Though he\ndeclined Government orders for cannon, he seems to have had a secret\nhankering after the \"pomp and circumstance\" of military life.  At all\nevent's he was present on Blackheath one day when George III. was\nreviewing some troops.  Mr. Reynold's horse, an old trooper, no sooner\nheard the sound of the trumpet than he started off at full speed, and\nmade directly for the group of officers before whom the troops were\ndefiling.  Great was the surprise of the King when he saw the Quaker\ndraw up alongside of him, but still greater, perhaps, was the confusion\nof the Quaker at finding himself in such company.\n\nDuring the later years of his life, while living at Bristol, his hand\nwas in every good work; and it was often felt where it was not seen.\nFor he carefully avoided ostentation, and preferred doing his good in\nsecret.  He strongly disapproved of making charitable bequests by will,\nwhich he observed in many cases to have been the foundation of enormous\nabuses, but held it to be the duty of each man to do all the possible\ngood that he could during his lifetime.  Many were the instances of his\nprincely, though at the time unknown, munificence.  Unwilling to be\nrecognised as the giver of large sums, he employed agents to dispense\nhis anonymous benefactions.  He thus sent 20,000L. to London to be\ndistributed during the distress of 1795.  He had four almoners\nconstantly employed in Bristol, finding out cases of distress,\nrelieving them, and presenting their accounts to him weekly, with\ndetails of the cases relieved.  He searched the debtors' prisons, and\nwhere, as often happened, deserving but unfortunate men were found\nconfined for debt, he paid the claims against them and procured their\nrelease.  Such a man could not fail to be followed with blessings and\ngratitude; but these he sought to direct to the Giver of all Good.  \"My\ntalent,\" said he to a friend, \"is the meanest of all talents--a little\nsordid dust; but as the man in the parable who had but one talent was\nheld accountable, I also am accountable for the talent that I possess,\nhumble as it is, to the great Lord of all.\"  On one occasion the case\nof a poor orphan boy was submitted to him, whose parents, both dying\nyoung, had left him destitute, on which Mr. Reynolds generously offered\nto place a sum in the names of trustees for his education and\nmaintenance until he could be apprenticed to a business.  The lady who\nrepresented the case was so overpowered by the munificence of the act\nthat she burst into tears, and, struggling to express her gratitude,\nconcluded with--\"and when the dear child is old enough, I will teach\nhim to thank his benefactor.\"  \"Thou must teach him to look higher,\"\ninterrupted Reynolds:  \"Do we thank the clouds for rain? When the child\ngrows up, teach him to thank Him who sendeth both the clouds and the\nrain.\"  Reynolds himself deplored his infirmity of temper, which was by\nnature hasty; and, as his benevolence was known, and appeals were made\nto him at all times, seasonable and unseasonable, he sometimes met them\nwith a sharp word, which, however, he had scarcely uttered before he\nrepented of it:  and he is known to have followed a poor woman to her\nhome and ask forgiveness for having spoken hastily in answer to her\napplication for help.\n\nThis \"great good man\" died on the 10th of September, 1816, in the 81st\nyear of his age.  At his funeral the poor of Bristol were the chief\nmourners.  The children of the benevolent societies which he had\nmunificently supported during his lifetime, and some of which he had\nfounded, followed his body to the grave.  The procession was joined by\nthe clergy and ministers of all denominations, and by men of all\nclasses and persuasions.  And thus was Richard Reynolds laid to his\nrest, leaving behind him a name full of good odour, which will long be\nheld in grateful remembrance by the inhabitants of Bristol.\n\n\n\n[1] Dr. PLOT, Natural History of Staffordshire, 2nd ed. 1686, p. 128.\n\n[2] JOSHUA GEE, The Trade and Navigation of Great Britain considered,\n1731.\n\n[3] When a bill was introduced into Parliament in 1750 with the object\nof encouraging the importation of iron from our American colonies, the\nSheffield tanners petitioned against it, on the ground that, if it\npassed, English iron would be undersold; many forges would consequently\nbe discontinued; in which case the timber used for fuel would remain\nuncut, and the tanners would thereby be deprived of bark for the\npurposes of their trade!\n\n[4] History of the Iron Trade, p. 56.\n\n[5] See Mr. Powle's account of the Iron Works in the Forest of Dean\n(1677-8), in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. ii. p. 418, where he\nsays, \"After they have pounded their ore, their first work is to\ncalcine it, which is done in kilns, much after the fashion of ordinary\nlime-kilns, These they fill up to the top with coal and ore, stratum\nsuper stratum, until it be full; and so setting fire to the bottom,\nthey let it burn till the coal be wasted, and then renew the kilns with\nfresh ore and coal, in the same manner as before.  This is done without\nfusion of the metal, and serves to consume the more drossy parts of the\nore and to make it friable.\"  The writer then describes the process of\nsmelting the ore mixed with cinder in the furnaces, where, he says, the\nfuel is \"always of charcoal.\"  \"Several attempts,\" he adds, \"have been\nmade to introduce the use of sea-coal in these works instead of\ncharcoal, the former being to be had at an easier rate than the latter;\nbut hitherto they have proved ineffectual, the workmen finding by\nexperience that a sea-coal fire, how vehement soever, will not\npenetrate the most fixed parts of the ore, and so leaves much of the\nmetal unmelted\"\n\n[6] Phil.

It is\ncurious that Rovenson, in his Treatise of Metallica of 1613, describes\na reverberatory furnace in which iron was to be smelted by pit-coal,\nthough it does not appear that he succeeded in perfecting his\ninvention.  Dr. Percy, in his excellent work on Metallurgy, thus\ndescribes a reverberatory furnace:--\"It consists essentially of three\nparts--a fireplace at one end, a stack or chimney at the other, and a\nbed between both on which the matter is heated.  The fireplace is\nseparated from the bed by a low partition wall called the fire-bridge,\nand both are covered by an arched roof which rises from the end wall of\nthe fireplace and gradually dips toward the furthest end of the bed\nconnected with the stack.  On one or both sides of the bed, or at the\nend near the stack, may be openings through which the ore spread over\nthe surface of the bed may be stirred about and exposed to the action\nof the air.  The matter is heated in such a furnace by flame, and is\nkept from contact with the solid fuel.  The flame in its course from\nthe fireplace to the stack is reflected downwards or REVERBERATED on\nthe matter beneath, whence the name REVERBERATORY furnace.\"\n\n[8] Mr. TYLOR on Metal Work--Reports on the Paris Exhibition of 1855.\nPart II. 182.

In the description of the\nfirst iron bridge given in that work we have, it appears, attributed\nrather more credit to Mr. Wilkinson than he is entitled to.  Mr. Darby\nwas the most active promoter of the scheme, and had the principal share\nin the design.  Wilkinson nevertheless was a man of great energy and\noriginality.  Besides being the builder of the first iron ship, he was\nthe first to invent, for James Watt, a machine that would bore a\ntolerably true cylinder.  He afterwards established iron works in\nFrance, and Arthur Young says, that \"until that well-known English\nmanufacturer arrived, the French knew nothing of the art of casting\ncannon solid and then boring them\" (Travels in France, 4to. ed.

The Hindoos were\nespecially skilled in the art of making steel, as indeed they are to\nthis day; and it is supposed that the tools with which the Egyptians\ncovered their obelisks and temples of porphyry and syenite with\nhieroglyphics were made of Indian steel, as probably no other metal was\ncapable of executing such work.  The art seems to have been well known\nin Germany in the Middle Ages, and the process is on the whole very\nfaithfully described by Agricola in his great work on Metallurgy.[1]\nEngland then produced very little steel, and was mainly dependent for\nits supply of the article upon the continental makers.\n\nFrom an early period Sheffield became distinguished for its manufacture\nof iron and steel into various useful articles.  We find it mentioned\nin the thirteenth century as a place where the best arrowheads were\nmade,--the Earl of Richmond owing his success at the battle of Bosworth\npartly to their superior length, sharpness, and finish.  The\nmanufactures of the town became of a more pacific character in the\nfollowing centuries, during which knives, tools, and implements of\nhusbandry became the leading articles.\n\nChaucer's reference to the 'Sheffield thwytel' (or case-knife) in his\nCanterbury Tales, written about the end of the fourteenth century,\nshows that the place had then become known for its manufacture of\nknives.  In 1575 we find the Earl of Shrewsbury presenting to his\nfriend Lord Burleigh \"a case of Hallamshire whittells, being such\nfruites as his pore cuntrey affordeth with fame throughout the realme.\"\nFuller afterwards speaks of the Sheffield knives as \"for common use of\nthe country people,\" and he cites an instance of a knave who cozened\nhim out of fourpence for one when it was only worth a penny.\n\nIn 1600 Sheffield became celebrated for its tobacco-boxes and\nJew's-harps.  The town was as yet of small size and population; for\nwhen a survey of it was made in 1615 it was found to contain not more\nthan 2207 householders, of whom one-third, or 725, were \"not able to\nlive without the charity of their neighbours:  these are all Begging\npoor.\" [2]  It must, however, have continued its manufacture of knives;\nfor we find that the knife with which Felton stabbed the Duke of\nBuckingham at Portsmouth in 1628 was traced to Sheffield.  The knife\nwas left sticking in the duke's body, and when examined was found to\nbear the Sheffield corporation mark.  It was ultimately ascertained to\nhave been made by one Wild, a cutler, who had sold the knife for\ntenpence to Felton when recruiting in the town.  At a still later\nperiod, the manufacture of clasp or spring knives was introduced into\nSheffield by Flemish workmen.  Harrison says this trade was begun in\n1650.  The clasp-knife was commonly known in the North as a jocteleg.\nHence Burns, describing the famous article treasured by Captain Grose\nthe antiquarian, says that--\n\n  \"It was a faulding jocteleq,\n  Or lang-kail gully;\"\n\nthe word being merely a corruption of Jacques de Liege, a famous\nforeign cutler, whose knives were as well known throughout Europe as\nthose of Rogers or Mappin are now.  Scythes and sickles formed other\nbranches of manufacture introduced by the Flemish artisans, the makers\nof the former principally living in the parish of Norton, those of the\nlatter in Eckington.\n\nMany improvements were introduced from time to time in the material of\nwhich these articles were made.  Instead of importing the German steel,\nas it was called, the Sheffield manufacturers began to make it\nthemselves, principally from Dannemora iron imported from Sweden.  The\nfirst English manufacturer of the article was one Crowley, a Newcastle\nman; and the Sheffield makers shortly followed his example.  We may\nhere briefly state that the ordinary method of preparing this valuable\nmaterial of manufactures is by exposing iron bars, placed in contact\nwith roughly-granulated charcoal, to an intense heat,--the process\nlasting for about a week, more or less, according to the degree of\ncarbonization required.  By this means, what is called BLISTERED STEEL\nis produced, and it furnishes the material out of which razors, files,\nknives, swords, and various articles of hardware are manufactured.  A\nfurther process is the manufacture of the metal thus treated into SHEAR\nSTEEL, by exposing a fasciculus of the blistered steel rods, with sand\nscattered over them for the purposes of a flux, to the heat of a\nwind-furnace until the whole mass becomes of a welding heat, when it is\ntaken from the fire and drawn out under a forge-hammer,--the process of\nwelding being repeated, after which the steel is reduced to the\nrequired sizes.  The article called FAGGOT steel is made after a\nsomewhat similar process.\n\nBut the most valuable form in which steel is now used in the\nmanufactures of Sheffield is that of cast-steel, in which iron is\npresented in perhaps its very highest state of perfection.  Cast-steel\nconsists of iron united to carbon in an elastic state together with a\nsmall portion of oxygen; whereas crude or pig iron consists of iron\ncombined with carbon in a material state.[3]  Chief merits of\ncast-steel consist in its possessing great cohesion and closeness of\ngrain, with an astonishing degree of tenacity and\nflexibility,--qualities which render it of the highest value in all\nkinds of tools and instruments where durability, polish, and fineness\nof edge are essential requisites.  It is to this material that we are\nmainly indebted for the exquisite cutting instrument of the surgeon,\nthe chisel of the sculptor, the steel plate on which the engraver\npractises his art, the cutting tools employed in the various processes\nof skilled handicraft, down to the common saw or the axe used by the\nbackwoodsman in levelling the primeval forest.\n\nThe invention of cast-steel is due to Benjamin Huntsman, of\nAttercliffe, near Sheffield.  M. Le Play, Professor of Metallurgy in\nthe Royal School of Mines of France, after making careful inquiry and\nweighing all the evidence on the subject, arrived at the conclusion\nthat the invention fairly belongs to Huntsman.  The French professor\nspeaks of it as a \"memorable discovery,\" made and applied with\nadmirable perseverance; and he claims for its inventor the\ndistinguished merit of advancing the steel manufactures of Yorkshire to\nthe first rank, and powerfully contributing to the establishment on a\nfirm foundation of the industrial and commercial supremacy of Great\nBritain.  It is remarkable that a French writer should have been among\nthe first to direct public attention to the merits of this inventor,\nand to have first published the few facts known as to his history in a\nFrench Government Report,--showing the neglect which men of this class\nhave heretofore received at home, and the much greater esteem in which\nthey are held by scientific foreigners.[4]  Le Play, in his\nenthusiastic admiration of the discoverer of so potent a metal as\ncast-steel, paid a visit to Huntsman's grave in Atterclifle Churchyard,\nnear Sheffield, and from the inscription on his tombstone recites the\nfacts of his birth, his death, and his brief history.  With the\nassistance of his descendants, we are now enabled to add the following\nrecord of the life and labours of this remarkable but almost forgotten\nman.\n\nBenjamin Huntsman was born in Lincolnshire in the year 1704.  His\nparents were of German extraction, and had settled in this country only\na few years previous to his birth.  The boy being of an ingenious turn,\nwas bred to a mechanical calling; and becoming celebrated for his\nexpertness in repairing clocks, he eventually set up in business as a\nclock maker and mender in the town of Doncaster.  He also undertook\nvarious other kinds of metal work, such as the making and repairing of\nlocks, smoke-jacks, roasting-jacks, and other articles requiring\nmechanical skill.  He was remarkably shrewd, observant, thoughtful, and\npractical; so much so that he came to be regarded as the \"wise man\" of\nhis neighbourhood, and was not only consulted as to the repairs of\nmachinery, but also of the human frame.  He practised surgery with\ndexterity, though after an empirical fashion, and was held in especial\nesteem as an oculist.  His success was such that his advice was sought\nin many surgical diseases, and he was always ready to give it, but\ndeclined receiving any payment in return.\n\nIn the exercise of his mechanical calling, he introduced several\nimproved tools, but was much hindered by the inferior quality of the\nmetal supplied to him, which was common German steel.  He also\nexperienced considerable difficulty in finding a material suitable for\nthe springs and pendulums of his clocks.  These circumstances induced\nhim to turn his attention to the making of a better kind of steel than\nwas then procurable, for the purposes of his trade.  His first\nexperiments were conducted at Doncaster;[5] but as fuel was difficult\nto be had at that place, he determined, for greater convenience, to\nremove to the neighbourhood of Sheffield, which he did in 1740.  He\nfirst settled at Handsworth, a few miles to the south of that town, and\nthere pursued his investigations in secret.  Unfortunately, no records\nhave been preserved of the methods which he adopted in overcoming the\ndifficulties he had necessarily to encounter.  That they must have been\ngreat is certain, for the process of manufacturing cast-steel of a\nfirst-rate quality even at this day is of a most elaborate and delicate\ncharacter, requiring to be carefully watched in its various stages.  He\nhad not only to discover the fuel and flux suitable for his purpose,\nbut to build such a furnace and make such a crucible as should sustain\na heat more intense than any then known in metallurgy.  Ingot-moulds\nhad not yet been cast, nor were there hoops and wedges made that would\nhold them together, nor, in short, were any of those materials at his\ndisposal which are now so familiar at every melting-furnace.\n\nHuntsman's experiments extended over many years before the desired\nresult was achieved.  Long after his death, the memorials of the\nnumerous failures through which he toilsomely worked his way to\nsuccess, were brought to light in the shape of many hundredweights of\nsteel, found buried in the earth in different places about his\nmanufactory.  From the number of these wrecks of early experiments, it\nis clear that he had worked continuously upon his grand idea of\npurifying the raw steel then in use, by melting it with fluxes at an\nintense heat in closed earthen crucibles.  The buried masses were found\nin various stages of failure, arising from imperfect melting, breaking\nof crucibles, and bad fluxes; and had been hid away as so much spoiled\nsteel of which nothing could be made.  At last his perseverance was\nrewarded, and his invention perfected; and though a hundred years have\npassed since Huntsman's discovery, the description of fuel (coke) which\nhe first applied for the purpose of melting the steel, and the\ncrucibles and furnaces which he used, are for the most part similar to\nthose in use at the present day.  Although the making of cast-steel is\nconducted with greater economy and dexterity, owing to increased\nexperience, it is questionable whether any maker has since been able to\nsurpass the quality of Huntsman's manufacture.\n\nThe process of making cast-steel, as invented by Benjamin Huntsman, may\nbe thus summarily described.  The melting is conducted in clay pots or\ncrucibles manufactured for the purpose, capable of holding about 34\nlbs. each.  Ten or twelve of such crucibles are placed in a\nmelting-furnace similar to that used by brass founders; and when the\nfurnace and pots are at a white heat, to which they are raised by a\ncoke fire, they are charged with bar steel reduced to a certain degree\nof hardness, and broken into pieces of about a pound each.  When the\npots are all thus charged with steel, lids are placed over them, the\nfurnace is filled with coke, and the cover put down.  Under the intense\nheat to which the metal is exposed, it undergoes an apparent\nebullition.  When the furnace requires feeding, the workmen take the\nopportunity of lifting the lid of each crucible and judging how far the\nprocess has advanced.  After about three hours' exposure to the heat,\nthe metal is ready for \"teeming.\"  The completion of the melting\nprocess is known by the subsidence of all ebullition, and by the clear\nsurface of the melted metal, which is of a dazzling brilliancy like the\nsun when looked at with the naked eye on a clear day.  The pots are\nthen lifted out of their place, and the liquid steel is poured into\ningots of the shape and size required.  The pots are replaced, filled\nagain, and the process is repeated; the red-hot pots thus serving for\nthree successive charges, after which they are rejected as useless.\n\nWhen Huntsman had perfected his invention, it would naturally occur to\nhim that the new metal might be employed for other purposes besides\nclock-springs and pendulums.  The business of clock-making was then of\na very limited character, and it could scarcely have been worth his\nwhile to pursue so extensive and costly a series of experiments merely\nto supply the requirements of that trade.  It is more probable that at\nan early stage of his investigations he shrewdly foresaw the extensive\nuses to which cast-steel might be applied in the manufacture of tools\nand cutlery of a superior kind; and we accordingly find him early\nendeavouring to persuade the manufacturers of Sheffield to employ it in\nthe manufacture of knives and razors.  But the cutlers obstinately\nrefused to work a material so much harder than that which they had been\naccustomed to use; and for a time he gave up all hopes of creating a\ndemand in that quarter.  Foiled in his endeavours to sell his steel at\nhome, Huntsman turned his attention to foreign markets; and he soon\nfound he could readily sell abroad all that he could make.  The merit\nof employing cast-steel for general purposes belongs to the French,\nalways so quick to appreciate the advantages of any new discovery, and\nfor a time the whole of the cast-steel that Huntsman could manufacture\nwas exported to France.  When he had fairly established his business\nwith that country, the Sheffield cutlers became alarmed at the\nreputation which cast-steel was acquiring abroad; and when they heard\nof the preference displayed by English as well as French consumers for\nthe cutlery manufactured of that metal, they readily apprehended the\nserious consequences that must necessarily result to their own trade if\ncast-steel came into general use.  They then appointed a deputation to\nwait upon Sir George Savile, one of the members for the county of York,\nand requested him to use his influence with the government to obtain an\norder to prohibit the exportation of cast-steel.  But on learning from\nthe deputation that the Sheffield manufacturers themselves would not\nmake use of the new steel, he positively declined to comply with their\nrequest.  It was indeed fortunate for the interests of the town that\nthe object of the deputation was defeated, for at that time Mr.\nHuntsman had very pressing and favourable offers from some spirited\nmanufacturers in Birmingham to remove his furnaces to that place; and\nit is extremely probable that had the business of cast-steel making\nbecome established there, one of the most important and lucrative\nbranches of its trade would have been lost to the town of Sheffield.\n\nThe Sheffield makers were therefore under the necessity of using the\ncast-steel, if they would retain their trade in cutlery against France;\nand Huntsman's home trade rapidly increased.  And then began the\nefforts of the Sheffield men to wrest his secret from him.  For\nHuntsman had not taken out any patent for his invention, his only\nprotection being in preserving his process as much a mystery as\npossible.  All the workmen employed by him were pledged to inviolable\nsecrecy; strangers were carefully excluded from the works; and the\nwhole of the steel made was melted during the night.  There were many\nspeculations abroad as to Huntsman's process.  It was generally\nbelieved that his secret consisted in the flux which he employed to\nmake the metal melt more readily; and it leaked out amongst the workmen\nthat he used broken bottles for the purpose.  Some of the\nmanufacturers, who by prying and bribing got an inkling of the process,\nfollowed Huntsman implicitly in this respect; and they would not allow\ntheir own workmen to flux the pots lest they also should obtain\npossession of the secret.  But it turned out eventually that no such\nflux was necessary, and the practice has long since been discontinued.\nA Frenchman named Jars, frequently quoted by Le Play in his account of\nthe manufacture of steel in Yorkshire,[6] paid a visit to Sheffield\ntowards the end of last century, and described the process so far as he\nwas permitted to examine it.  According to his statement all kinds of\nfragments of broken steel were used; but this is corrected by Le Play,\nwho states that only the best bar steel manufactured of Dannemora iron\nwas employed.  Jars adds that \"the steel is put into the crucible with\nA FLUX, the composition of which is kept secret;\" and he states that\nthe time then occupied in the conversion was five hours.\n\nIt is said that the person who first succeeded in copying Huntsman's\nprocess was an ironfounder named Walker, who carried on his business at\nGreenside near Sheffield, and it was certainly there that the making of\ncast-steel was next begun.  Walker adopted the \"ruse\" of disguising\nhimself as a tramp, and, feigning great distress and abject poverty, he\nappeared shivering at the door of Huntsman's foundry late one night\nwhen the workmen were about to begin their labours at steel-casting,\nand asked for admission to warm himself by the furnace fire.  The\nworkmen's hearts were moved, and they permitted him to enter.  We have\nthe above facts from the descendants of the Huntsman family; but we add\nthe traditional story preserved in the neighbourhood, as given in a\nwell-known book on metallurgy:--\n\n\"One cold winter's night, while the snow was falling in heavy flakes,\nand the manufactory threw its red glared light over the neighbourhood,\na person of the most abject appearance presented himself at the\nentrance, praying for permission to share the warmth and shelter which\nit afforded.  The humane workmen found the appeal irresistible, and the\napparent beggar was permitted to take up his quarters in a warm corner\nof the building.  A careful scrutiny would have discovered little real\nsleep in the drowsiness which seemed to overtake the stranger; for he\neagerly watched every movement of the workmen while they went through\nthe operations of the newly discovered process.  He observed, first of\nall, that bars of blistered steel were broken into small pieces, two or\nthree inches in length, and placed in crucibles of fire clay.  When\nnearly full, a little green glass broken into small fragments was\nspread over the top, and the whole covered over with a closely-fitting\ncover.  The crucibles were then placed in a furnace previously prepared\nfor them, and after a lapse of from three to four hours, during which\nthe crucibles were examined from time to time to see that the metal was\nthoroughly melted and incorporated, the workmen proceeded to lift the\ncrucible from its place on the furnace by means of tongs, and its\nmolten contents, blazing, sparkling, and spurting, were poured into a\nmould of cast-iron previously prepared:  here it was suffered to cool,\nwhile the crucibles were again filled, and the process repeated.  When\ncool, the mould was unscrewed, and a bar of cast-steel presented\nitself, which only required the aid of the hammerman to form a finished\nbar of cast-steel.  How the unauthorized spectator of these operations\neffected his escape without detection tradition does not say; but it\ntells us that, before many months had passed, the Huntsman manufactory\nwas not the only one where cast-steel was produced.\" [7]\n\nHowever the facts may be, the discovery of the elder Huntsman proved of\nthe greatest advantage to Sheffield; for there is scarcely a civilized\ncountry where Sheffield steel is not largely used, either in its most\nhighly finished forms of cutlery, or as the raw material for some home\nmanufacture.  In the mean time the demand for Huntsman's steel steadily\nincreased, and in 1770, for the purpose of obtaining greater scope for\nhis operations, he removed to a large new manufactory which he erected\nat Attercliffe, a little to the north of Sheffield, more conveniently\nsituated for business purposes.  There he continued to flourish for six\nyears more, making steel and practising benevolence; for, like the\nDarbys and Reynoldses of Coalbrookdale, he was a worthy and highly\nrespected member of the Society of Friends.  He was well versed in the\nscience of his day, and skilled in chemistry, which doubtless proved of\ngreat advantage to him in pursuing his experiments in metallurgy.[8]\nThat he was possessed of great perseverance will be obvious from the\ndifficulties he encountered and overcame in perfecting his valuable\ninvention.  He was, however, like many persons of strong original\ncharacter, eccentric in his habits and reserved in his manner.  The\nRoyal Society wished to enrol him as a member in acknowledgment of the\nhigh merit of his discovery of cast-steel, as well as because of his\nskill in practical chemistry; but as this would have drawn him in some\nmeasure from his seclusion, and was also, as he imagined, opposed to\nthe principles of the Society to which he belonged, he declined the\nhonour.  Mr. Huntsman died in 1776, in his seventy-second year, and was\nburied in the churchyard at Attercliffe, where a gravestone with an\ninscription marks his resting-place.\n\nHis son continued to carry on the business, and largely extended its\noperations.  The Huntsman mark became known throughout the civilised\nworld.  Le Play the French Professor of Metallurgy, in his Memoire of\n1846, still speaks of the cast-steel bearing the mark of \"Huntsman and\nMarshall\" as the best that is made, and he adds, \"the buyer of this\narticle, who pays a higher price for it than for other sorts, is not\nacting merely in the blind spirit of routine, but pays a logical and\nwell-deserved homage to all the material and moral qualities of which\nthe true Huntsman mark has been the guarantee for a century.\" [9]\n\nMany other large firms now compete for their share of the trade; and\nthe extent to which it has grown, the number of furnaces constantly at\nwork, and the quantity of steel cast into ingots, to be tilted or\nrolled for the various purposes to which it is applied, have rendered\nSheffield the greatest laboratory in the world of this valuable\nmaterial.  Of the total quantity of cast-steel manufactured in England,\nnot less than five-sixths are produced there; and the facilities for\nexperiment and adaptation on the spot have enabled the Sheffield\nsteel-makers to keep the lead in the manufacture, and surpass all\nothers in the perfection to which they have carried this important\nbranch of our national industry.  It is indeed a remarkable fact that\nthis very town, which was formerly indebted to Styria for the steel\nused in its manufactures, now exports a material of its own conversion\nto the Austrian forges and other places on the Continent from which it\nwas before accustomed to draw its own supplies.\n\nAmong the improved processes invented of late years for the manufacture\nof steel are those of Heath, Mushet, and Bessemer.  The last promises\nto effect before long an entire revolution in the iron and steel trade.\nBy it the crude metal is converted by one simple process, directly as\nit comes from the blast-furnace.  This is effected by driving through\nit, while still in a molten state, several streams of atmospheric air,\non which the carbon of the crude iron unites with the oxygen of the\natmosphere, the temperature is greatly raised, and a violent ebullition\ntakes place, during which, if the process be continued, that part of\nthe carbon which appears to be mechanically mixed and diffused through\nthe crude iron is entirely consumed.  The metal becomes thoroughly\ncleansed, the slag is ejected and removed, while the sulphur and other\nvolatile matters are driven off; the result being an ingot of malleable\niron of the quality of charcoal iron.  An important feature in the\nprocess is, that by stopping it at a particular stage, immediately\nfollowing the boil, before the whole of the carbon has been abstracted\nby the oxygen, the crude iron will be found to have passed into the\ncondition of cast-steel of ordinary quality.  By continuing the\nprocess, the metal losing its carbon, it passes from hard to soft\nsteel, thence to steely iron, and last of all to very soft iron; so\nthat by interrupting the process at any stage, or continuing it to the\nend, almost any quality of iron and steel may be obtained.  One of the\nmost valuable forms of the metal is described by Mr. Bessemer as\n\"semi-steel,\" being in hardness about midway between ordinary\ncast-steel and soft malleable iron.  The Bessemer processes are now in\nfull operation in England as well as abroad, both for converting crude\ninto malleable iron, and for producing steel; and the results are\nexpected to prove of the greatest practical utility in all cases where\niron and steel are extensively employed.\n\nYet, like every other invention, this of Mr. Bessemer had long been\ndreamt of, if not really made.  We are informed in Warner's Tour\nthrough the Northern.  Counties of England, published at Bath in 1801,\nthat a Mr. Reed of Whitehaven had succeeded at that early period in\nmaking steel direct from the ore; and Mr. Mushet clearly alludes to the\nprocess in his \"Papers on Iron and Steel.\"  Nevertheless, Mr. Bessemer\nis entitled to the merit of working out the idea, and bringing the\nprocess to perfection, by his great skill and indomitable perseverance.\nIn the Heath process, carburet of manganese is employed to aid the\nconversion of iron into steel, while it also confers on the metal the\nproperty of welding and working more soundly under the hammer--a fact\ndiscovered by Mr. Heath while residing in India.  Mr. Mushet's process\nis of a similar character.  Another inventor, Major Uchatius, an\nAustrian engineer, granulates crude iron while in a molten state by\npouring it into water, and then subjecting it to the process of\nconversion.  Some of the manufacturers still affect secrecy in their\noperations; but as one of the Sanderson firm--famous for the excellence\nof their steel--remarked to a visitor when showing him over their\nworks, \"the great secret is to have the courage to be honest--a spirit\nto purchase the best material, and the means and disposition to do\njustice to it in the manufacture.\"\n\nIt remains to be added, that much of the success of the Sheffield\nmanufactures is attributable to the practical skill of the workmen, who\nhave profited by the accumulated experience treasured up by their class\nthrough many generations.  The results of the innumerable experiments\nconducted before their eyes have issued in a most valuable though\nunwritten code of practice, the details of which are known only to\nthemselves.  They are also a most laborious class; and Le Play says of\nthem, when alluding to the fact of a single workman superintending the\noperations of three steel-casting furnaces--\"I have found nowhere in\nEurope, except in England, workmen able for an entire day, without any\ninterval of rest, to undergo such toilsome and exhausting labour as\nthat performed by these Sheffield workmen.\"\n\n\n\n[1] AGRICOLA, De Re Metallica.

Nothing is known as to Henry's\nearly history; but he seems to have raised himself by his own efforts\nto a respectable position.  In 1765 we find him established in Surrey\nStreet, Strand, carrying on the business of a navy agent, in which he\nis said to have realized considerable profits.  It was while conducting\nthis business that he became aware of the inferiority of British iron\ncompared with that obtained from foreign countries.  The English\nwrought iron was considered so bad that it was prohibited from all\ngovernment supplies, while the cast iron was considered of too brittle\na nature to be suited for general use.[1]  Indeed the Russian\ngovernment became so persuaded that the English nation could not carry\non their manufactures without Russian iron, that in 1770 they ordered\nthe price to be raised from 70 and 80 copecs per pood to 200 and 220\ncopecs per pood.[2]\n\nSuch being the case, Cort's attention became directed to the subject in\nconnection with the supply of iron to the Navy, and he entered on a\nseries of experiments with the object of improving the manufacture of\nEnglish iron.  What the particular experiments were, and by what steps\nhe arrived at results of so much importance to the British iron trade,\nno one can now tell.  All that is known is, that about the year 1775 he\nrelinquished his business as a navy agent, and took a lease of certain\npremises at Fontley, near Fareham, at the north-western corner of\nPortsmouth Harbour, where he erected a forge and an iron mill.  He was\nafterwards joined in partnership by Samuel Jellicoe (son of Adam\nJellicoe, then Deputy-Paymaster of Seamen's Wages), which turned out,\nas will shortly appear, a most unfortunate connection for Cort.\n\nAs in the case of other inventions, Cort took up the manufacture of\niron at the point to which his predecessors had brought it, carrying it\nstill further, and improving upon their processes.  We may here briefly\nrecite the steps by which the manufacture of bar-iron by means of\npit-coal had up to this time been advanced.  In 1747, Mr. Ford\nsucceeded at Coalbrookdale in smelting iron ore with pit-coal, after\nwhich it was refined in the usual way by means of coke and charcoal.\nIn 1762, Dr. Roebuck (hereafter to be referred to) took out a patent\nfor melting the cast or pig iron in a hearth heated with pit-coal by\nthe blast of bellows, and then working the iron until it was reduced to\nnature, or metallized, as it was termed; after which it was exposed to\nthe action of a hollow pit-coal fire urged by a blast, until it was\nreduced to a loop and drawn out into bar-iron under a common\nforge-hammer.  Then the brothers Cranege, in 1766, adopted the\nreverberatory or air furnace, in which they placed the pig or cast\niron, and without blast or the addition of anything more than common\nraw pit-coal, converted the same into good malleable iron, which being\ntaken red hot from the reverberatory furnace to the forge hammer, was\ndrawn into bars according to the will of the workman.  Peter Onions of\nMerthyr Tydvil, in 1783, carried the manufacture a stage further, as\ndescribed by him in his patent of that year.  Having charged his\nfurnace (\"bound with iron work and well annealed\") with pig or fused\ncast iron from the smelting furnace, it was closed up and the doors\nwere luted with sand.  The fire was urged by a blast admitted\nunderneath, apparently for the purpose of keeping up the combustion of\nthe fuel on the grate.  Thus Onions' furnace was of the nature of a\npuddling furnace, the fire of which was urged by a blast.  The fire was\nto be kept up until the metal became less fluid, and \"thickened into a\nkind of froth, which the workman, by opening the door, must turn and\nstir with a bar or other iron instrument, and then close the aperture\nagain, applying the blast and fire until there was a ferment in the\nmetal.\"  The patent further describes that \"as the workman stirs the\nmetal,\" the scoriae will separate, \"and the particles of iron will\nadhere, which particles the workman must collect or gather into a mass\nor lump.\"  This mass or lump was then to be raised to a white heat, and\nforged into malleable iron at the forge-hammer.\n\nSuch was the stage of advance reached in the manufacture of bar-iron,\nwhen Henry Cort published his patents in 1783 and 1784.  In dispensing\nwith a blast, he had been anticipated by the Craneges, and in the\nprocess of puddling by Onions; but he introduced so many improvements\nof an original character, with which he combined the inventions of his\npredecessors, as to establish quite a new era in the history of the\niron manufacture, and, in the course of a few years, to raise it to the\nhighest state of prosperity.  As early as 1786, Lord Sheffield\nrecognised the great national importance of Cort's improvements in the\nfollowing words:--\"If Mr. Cort's very ingenious and meritorious\nimprovements in the art of making and working iron, the steam-engine of\nBoulton and Watt, and Lord Dundonald's discovery of making coke at half\nthe present price, should all succeed, it is not asserting too much to\nsay that the result will be more advantageous to Great Britain than the\npossession of the thirteen colonies (of America); for it will give the\ncomplete command of the iron trade to this country, with its vast\nadvantages to navigation.\"  It is scarcely necessary here to point out\nhow completely the anticipations of Lord Sheffield have been fulfilled,\nsanguine though they might appear to be when uttered some seventy-six\nyears ago.[3]\n\n\n\n\nWe will endeavour as briefly as possible to point out the important\ncharacter of Mr. Cort's improvements, as embodied in his two patents of\n1783 and 1784.  In the first he states that, after \"great study,\nlabour, and expense, in trying a variety of experiments, and making\nmany discoveries, he had invented and brought to perfection a peculiar\nmethod and process of preparing, welding, and working various sorts of\niron, and of reducing the same into uses by machinery:  a furnace, and\nother apparatus, adapted and applied to the said process.\"  He first\ndescribes his method of making iron for \"large uses,\" such as shanks,\narms, rings, and palms of anchors, by the method of piling and\nfaggoting, since become generally practised, by laying bars of iron of\nsuitable lengths, forged on purpose, and tapering so as to be thinner\nat one end than the other, laid over one another in the manner of\nbricks in buildings, so that the ends should everywhere overlay each\nother.  The faggots so prepared, to the amount of half a ton more or\nless, were then to be put into a common air or balling furnace, and\nbrought to a welding heat, which was accomplished by his method in a\nmuch shorter time than in any hollow fire; and when the heat was\nperfect, the faggots were then brought under a forge-hammer of great\nsize and weight, and welded into a solid mass.  Mr. Cort alleges in the\nspecification that iron for \"larger uses\" thus finished, is in all\nrespect's possessed of the highest degree of perfection; and that the\nfire in the balling furnace is better suited, from its regularity and\npenetrating quality, to give the iron a perfect welding heat throughout\nits whole mass, without fusing in any part, than any fire blown by a\nblast.  Another process employed by Mr. Cort for the purpose of\ncleansing the iron and producing a metal of purer grain, was that of\nworking the faggots by passing them through rollers.  \"By this simple\nprocess,\" said he, \"all the earthy particles are pressed out and the\niron becomes at once free from dross, and what is usually called\ncinder, and is compressed into a fibrous and tough state.\"  The\nobjection has indeed been taken to the process of passing the iron\nthrough rollers, that the cinder is not so effectually got rid of as by\npassing it under a tilt hammer, and that much of it is squeezed into\nthe bar and remains there, interrupting its fibre and impairing its\nstrength.\n\nIt does not appear that there was any novelty in the use of rollers by\nCort; for in his first specification he speaks of them as already well\nknown.[4]  His great merit consisted in apprehending the value of\ncertain processes, as tested by his own and others' experience, and\ncombining and applying them in a more effective practical form than had\never been done before.  This power of apprehending the best methods,\nand embodying the details in one complete whole, marks the practical,\nclear-sighted man, and in certain cases amounts almost to a genius.\nThe merit of combining the inventions of others in such forms as that\nthey shall work to advantage, is as great in its way as that of the man\nwho strikes out the inventions themselves, but who, for want of tact\nand experience, cannot carry them into practical effect.\n\nIt was the same with Cort's second patent, in which he described his\nmethod of manufacturing bar-iron from the ore or from cast-iron.  All\nthe several processes therein described had been practised before his\ntime; his merit chiefly consisting in the skilful manner in which he\ncombined and applied them.  Thus, like the Craneges, he employed the\nreverberatory or air furnace, without blast, and, like Onions, he\nworked the fused metal with iron bars until it was brought into lumps,\nwhen it was removed and forged into malleable iron.  Cort, however,\ncarried the process further, and made it more effectual in all\nrespects.  His method may be thus briefly described:  the bottom of the\nreverberatory furnace was hollow, so as to contain the fluid metal,\nintroduced into it by ladles; the heat being kept up by pit-coal or\nother fuel.  When the furnace was charged, the doors were closed until\nthe metal was sufficiently fused, when the workman opened an aperture\nand worked or stirred about the metal with iron bars, when an\nebullition took place, during the continuance of which a bluish flame\nwas emitted, the carbon of the cast-iron was burned off, the metal\nseparated from the slag, and the iron, becoming reduced to nature, was\nthen collected into lumps or loops of sizes suited to their intended\nuses, when they were drawn out of the doors of the furnace.  They were\nthen stamped into plates, and piled or worked in an air furnace, heated\nto a white or welding heat, shingled under a forge hammer, and passed\nthrough the grooved rollers after the method described in the first\npatent.\n\nThe processes described by Cort in his two patents have been followed\nby iron manufacturers, with various modifications, the results of\nenlarged experience, down to the present time.  After the lapse of\nseventy-eight years, the language employed by Cort continues on the\nwhole a faithful description of the processes still practised:  the\nsame methods of manufacturing bar from cast-iron, and of puddling,\npiling, welding, and working the bar-iron through grooved rollers--all\nare nearly identical with the methods of manufacture perfected by Henry\nCort in 1784.  It may be mentioned that the development of the powers\nof the steam-engine by Watt had an extraordinary effect upon the\nproduction of iron.  It created a largely increased demand for the\narticle for the purposes of the shafting and machinery which it was\nemployed to drive; while at the same time it cleared pits of water\nwhich before were unworkable, and by being extensively applied to the\nblowing of iron-furnaces and the working of the rolling-mills, it thus\ngave a still further impetus to the manufacture of the metal.  It would\nbe beside our purpose to enter into any statistical detail on the\nsubject; but it will be sufficient to state that the production of\niron, which in the early part of last century amounted to little more\nthan 12,000 tons, about the middle of the century to about 18,000 tons,\nand at the time of Cort's inventions to about 90,000 tons, was found,\nin 1820, to have increased to 400,000 tons; and now the total quantity\nproduced is upwards of four millions of tons of pig-iron every year, or\nmore than the entire production of all other European countries.  There\nis little reason to doubt that this extraordinary development of the\niron manufacture has been in a great measure due to the inventions of\nHenry Cort.  It is said that at the present time there are not fewer\nthan 8200 of Cort's furnaces in operation in Great Britain alone.[5]\n\nPractical men have regarded Cort's improvement of the process of\nrolling the iron as the most valuable of his inventions.  A competent\nauthority has spoken of Cort's grooved rollers as of \"high\nphilosophical interest, being scarcely less than the discovery of a new\nmechanical Power, in reversing the action of the wedge, by the\napplication of force to four surfaces, so as to elongate a mass,\ninstead of applying force to a mass to divide the four surfaces.\"  One\nof the best authorities in the iron trade of last century, Mr.\nAlexander Raby of Llanelly, like many others, was at first entirely\nsceptical as to the value of Cort's invention; but he had no sooner\nwitnessed the process than with manly candour he avowed his entire\nconversion to his views.\n\nWe now return to the history of the chief author of this great branch\nof national industry.  As might naturally be expected, the principal\nironmasters, when they heard of Cort's success, and the rapidity and\neconomy with which he manufactured and forged bar-iron, visited his\nfoundry for the purpose of examining his process, and, if found\nexpedient, of employing it at their own works.  Among the first to try\nit were Richard Crawshay of Cyfartha, Samuel Homfray of Penydarran\n(both in South Wales), and William Reynolds of Coalbrookdale.  Richard\nCrawshay was then (in 1787) forging only ten tons of bar-iron weekly\nunder the hammer; and when he saw the superior processes invented by\nCort he readily entered into a contract with him to work under his\npatents at ten shillings a ton royalty, In 1812 a letter from Mr.\nCrawshay to the Secretary of Lord Sheffield was read to the House of\nCommons, descriptive of his method of working iron, in which he said,\n\"I took it from a Mr. Cort, who had a little mill at Fontley in\nHampshire:  I have thus acquainted you with my method, by which I am\nnow making more than ten thousand tons of bar-iron per annum.\"  Samuel\nHomfray was equally prompt in adopting the new process.  He not only\nobtained from Cort plans of the puddling-furnaces and patterns of the\nrolls, but borrowed Cort's workmen to instruct his own in the necessary\noperations; and he soon found the method so superior to that invented\nby Onions that he entirely confined himself to manufacturing after\nCort's patent.  We also find Mr. Reynolds inviting Cort to conduct a\ntrial of his process at Ketley, though it does not appear that it was\nadopted by the firm at that time.[6]\n\nThe quality of the iron manufactured by the new process was found\nsatisfactory; and the Admiralty having, by the persons appointed by\nthem to test it in 1787, pronounced it to be superior to the best\nOregrounds iron, the use of the latter was thenceforward discontinued,\nand Cort's iron only was directed to be used for the anchors and other\nironwork in the ships of the Royal Navy.  The merits of the invention\nseem to have been generally conceded, and numerous contracts for\nlicences were entered into with Cort and his partner by the\nmanufacturers of bar-iron throughout the country.[7]  Cort himself made\narrangements for carrying on the manufacture on a large scale, and with\nthat object entered upon the possession of a wharf at Gosport,\nbelonging to Adam Jellicoe, his partner's father, where he succeeded in\nobtaining considerable Government orders for iron made after his\npatents.  To all ordinary eyes the inventor now appeared to be on the\nhigh road to fortune; but there was a fatal canker at the root of this\nseeming prosperity, and in a few years the fabric which he had so\nlaboriously raised crumbled into ruins.  On the death of Adam Jellicoe,\nthe father of Cort's partner, in August, 1789,[8] defalcations were\ndiscovered in his public accounts to the extent of 39,676L, and his\nbooks and papers were immediately taken possession of by the\nGovernment.  On examination it was found that the debts due to Jellicoe\namounted to 89,657L, included in which was a sum of not less than\n54,853L. owing to him by the Cort partnership.  In the public\ninvestigation which afterwards took place, it appeared that the capital\npossessed by Cort being insufficient to enable him to pursue his\nexperiments, which were of a very expensive character, Adam Jellicoe\nhad advanced money from time to time for the purpose, securing himself\nby a deed of agreement entitling him to one-half the stock and profits\nof all his contracts; and in further consideration of the capital\nadvanced by Jellicoe beyond his equal share, Cort subsequently assigned\nto him all his patent rights as collateral security.  As Jellicoe had\nthe reputation of being a rich man, Cort had not the slightest\nsuspicion of the source from which he obtained the advances made by him\nto the firm, nor has any connivance whatever on the part of Cort been\nsuggested.  At the same time it must be admitted that the connexion was\nnot free from suspicion, and, to say the least, it was a singularly\nunfortunate one.  It was found that among the moneys advanced by\nJellicoe to Cort there was a sum of 27,500L. entrusted to him for the\npayment of seamen's and officers' wages.  How his embarrassments had\ntempted him to make use of the public funds for the purpose of carrying\non his speculations, appears from his own admissions.  In a memorandum\ndated the 11th November, 1782, found in his strong box after his death,\nhe set forth that he had always had much more than his proper balance\nin hand, until his engagement, about two years before, with Mr. Cort,\n\"which by degrees has so reduced me, and employed so much more of my\nmoney than I expected, that I have been obliged to turn most of my Navy\nbills into cash, and at the same time, to my great concern, am very\ndeficient in my balance.  This gives me great uneasiness, nor shall I\nlive or die in peace till the whole is restored.\"  He had, however,\nmade the first false step, after which the downhill career of\ndishonesty is rapid.  His desperate attempts to set himself right only\ninvolved him the deeper; his conscious breach of trust caused him a\ndegree of daily torment which he could not bear; and the discovery of\nhis defalcations, which was made only a few days before his death,\ndoubtless hastened his end.\n\nThe Government acted with promptitude, as they were bound to do in such\na case.  The body of Jellicoe was worth nothing to them, but they could\nsecure the property in which he had fraudulently invested the public\nmoneys intrusted to him.  With this object the them Paymaster of the\nNavy proceeded to make an affidavit in the Exchequer that Henry Cort\nwas indebted to His Majesty in the sum of 27,500L. and upwards, in\nrespect of moneys belonging to the public treasury, which \"Adam\nJellicoe had at different times lent and advanced to the said Henry\nCort, from whom the same now remains justly due and owing; and the\ndeponent saith he verily believes that the said Henry Cort is much\ndecayed in his credit and in very embarrassed circumstances; and\ntherefore the deponent verily believes that the aforesaid debt so due\nand owing to His Majesty is in great danger of being lost if some more\nspeedy means be not taken for the recovery than by the ordinary process\nof the Court.\"  Extraordinary measures were therefore adopted.  The\nassignments of Cort's patents, which had been made to Jellicoe in\nconsideration of his advances, were taken possession of; but Samuel\nJellicoe, the son of the defaulter, singular to say, was put in\npossession of the properties at Fontley and Gosport, and continued to\nenjoy them, to Cort's exclusion, for a period of fourteen years.  It\ndoes not however appear that any patent right was ever levied by the\nassignees, and the result of the proceeding was that the whole benefit\nof Cort's inventions was thus made over to the ironmasters and to the\npublic.  Had the estate been properly handled, and the patent rights\ndue under the contracts made by the ironmasters with Cort been duly\nlevied, there is little reason to doubt that the whole of the debt\nowing to the Government would have been paid in the course of a few\nyears.  \"When we consider,\" says Mr. Webster, \"how very simple was the\nprocess of demanding of the contracting ironmasters the patent due\n(which for the year 1789 amounted to 15,000L., in 1790 to 15,000L., and\nin 1791 to 25,000L.), and which demand might have been enforced by the\nsame legal process used to ruin the inventor, it is not difficult to\nsurmise the motive for abstaining.\"  The case, however, was not so\nsimple as Mr. Webster puts it; for there was such a contingency as that\nof the ironmasters combining to dispute the patent right, and there is\nevery reason to believe that they were prepared to adopt that course.[9]\n\nAlthough the Cort patents expired in 1796 and 1798 respectively, they\ncontinued the subject of public discussion for some time after, more\nparticularly in connection with the defalcations of the deceased Adam\nJellicoe.  It does not appear that more than 2654L. was realised by the\nGovernment from the Cort estate towards the loss sustained by the\npublic, as a balance of 24,846L. was still found standing to the debit\nof Jellicoe in 1800, when the deficiencies in the naval account's\nbecame matter of public inquiry.  A few years later, in 1805, the\nsubject was again revived in a remarkable manner.  In that year, the\nWhigs, Perceiving the bodily decay of Mr. Pitt, and being too eager to\nwait for his removal by death, began their famous series of attacks\nupon his administration.  Fearing to tackle the popular statesman\nhimself, they inverted the ordinary tactics of an opposition, and fell\nfoul of Dundas, Lord Melville, then Treasurer of the Navy, who had\nsuccessfully carried the country through the great naval war with\nrevolutionary France.  They scrupled not to tax him with gross\npeculation, and exhibited articles of impeachment against him, which\nbecame the subject of elaborate investigation, the result of which is\nmatter of history.  In those articles, no reference whatever was made\nto Lord Melville's supposed complicity with Jellicoe; nor, on the trial\nthat followed, was any reference made to the defalcations of that\nofficial.  But when Mr. Whitbread, on the 8th of April, 1805, spoke to\nthe \"Resolutions\" in the Commons for impeaching the Treasurer of the\nNavy, he thought proper to intimate that he \"had a strong suspicion\nthat Jellicoe was in the same partnership with Mark Sprott, Alexander\nTrotter, and Lord Melville.  He had been suffered to remain a public\ndebtor for a whole year after he was known to be in arrears upwards of\n24,000L.  During next year 11,000L. more had accrued.  It would not\nhave been fair to have turned too short on an old companion.  It would\nperhaps, too, have been dangerous, since unpleasant discoveries might\nhave met the public eye.  It looked very much as if, mutually conscious\nof criminality, they had agreed to be silent, and keep their own\nsecrets.\"\n\nIn making these offensive observations Whitbread was manifestly\nactuated by political enmity.  They were utterly unwarrantable.  In the\nfirst place, Melville had been formally acquitted of Jellicoe's\ndeficiency by a writ of Privy Seal, dated 31st May, 1800; and secondly,\nthe committee appointed in that very year (1805) to reinvestigate the\nnaval accounts, had again exonerated him, but intimated that they were\nof opinion there was remissness on his part in allowing Jellicoe to\nremain in his office after the discovery of his defalcations.\n\nthe report made by the commissioners to the Houses of Parliament in\n1805,[10] the value of Corts patents was estimated at only 100L.\nReferring to the schedule of Jellicoe's alleged assets, they say \"Many\nof the debts are marked as bad; and we apprehend that the debt from Mr.\nHenry Cort, not so marked, of 54,000L. and upwards, is of that\ndescription.\"  As for poor bankrupt Henry Cort, these discussions\navailed nothing.  On the death of Jellicoe, he left his iron works,\nfeeling himself a ruined man.  He made many appeals to the Government\nof the day for restoral of his patents, and offered to find security\nfor payment of the debt due by his firm to the Crown, but in vain.  In\n1794, an appeal was made to Mr. Pitt by a number of influential members\nof Parliament, on behalf of the inventor and his destitute family of\ntwelve children, when a pension of 200L. a-year was granted him.  This\nMr. Cort enjoyed until the year 1800, when he died, broken in health\nand spirit, in his sixtieth year.  He was buried in Hampstead\nChurchyard, where a stone marking the date of his death is still to be\nseen.  A few years since it was illegible, but it has recently been\nrestored by his surviving son.\n\nThough Cort thus died in comparative poverty, he laid the foundations\nof many gigantic fortunes.  He may be said to have been in a great\nmeasure the author of our modern iron aristocracy, who still\nmanufacture after the processes which he invented or perfected, but for\nwhich they never paid him a shilling of royalty.  These men of gigantic\nfortunes have owed much--we might almost say everything--to the ruined\nprojector of \"the little mill at Fontley.\"  Their wealth has enriched\nmany families of the older aristocracy, and has been the foundation of\nseveral modern peerages.  Yet Henry Cort, the rock from which they were\nhewn, is already all but forgotten; and his surviving children, now\naged and infirm, are dependent for their support upon the slender\npittance wrung by repeated entreaty and expostulation from the state.\n\nThe career of Richard Crawshay, the first of the great ironmasters who\nhad the sense to appreciate and adopt the methods of manufacturing iron\ninvented by Henry Cort, is a not unfitting commentary on the sad\nhistory we have thus briefly described.  It shows how, as respects mere\nmoney-making, shrewdness is more potent than invention, and business\nfaculty than manufacturing skill.  Richard Crawshay was born at\nNormanton near Leeds, the son of a small Yorkshire farmer.  When a\nyouth, he worked on his father's farm, and looked forward to occupying\nthe same condition in life; but a difference with his father unsettled\nhis mind, and at the age of fifteen he determined to leave his home,\nand seek his fortune elsewhere.  Like most unsettled and enterprising\nlads, he first made for London, riding to town on a pony of his own,\nwhich, with the clothes on his back, formed his entire fortune.  It\ntook him a fortnight to make the journey, in consequence of the badness\nof the roads.  Arrived in London, he sold his pony for fifteen pounds,\nand the money kept him until he succeeded in finding employment.  He\nwas so fortunate as to be taken upon trial by a Mr. Bicklewith, who\nkept an ironmonger's shop in York Yard, Upper Thames Street; and his\nfirst duty there was to clean out the office, put the stools and desks\nin order for the other clerks, run errands, and act as porter when\noccasion required.  Young Crawshay was very attentive, industrious, and\nshrewd; and became known in the office as \"The Yorkshire Boy.\" Chiefly\nbecause of his \"cuteness,\" his master appointed him to the department\nof selling flat irons.  The London washerwomen of that day were very\nsharp and not very honest, and it used to be said of them that where\nthey bought one flat iron they generally contrived to steal two.  Mr.\nBicklewith thought he could not do better than set the Yorkshireman to\nwatch the washerwomen, and, by way of inducement to him to be vigilant,\nhe gave young Crawshay an interest in that branch of the business,\nwhich was soon found to prosper under his charge.  After a few more\nyears, Mr. Bicklewith retired, and left to Crawshay the cast-iron\nbusiness in York Yard.  This he still further increased, There was not\nat that time much enterprise in the iron trade, but Crawshay\nendeavoured to connect himself with what there was of it.  The price of\niron was then very high, and the best sorts were still imported from\nabroad; a good deal of the foreign iron and steel being still landed at\nthe Steelyard on the Thames, in the immediate neighbourhood of\nCrawshay's ironmongery store.\n\nIt seems to have occurred to some London capitalists that money was\nthen to be made in the iron trade, and that South Wales was a good\nfield for an experiment.  The soil there was known to be full of coal\nand ironstone, and several small iron works had for some time been\ncarried on, which were supposed to be doing well.  Merthyr Tydvil was\none of the places at which operations had been begun, but the place\nbeing situated in a hill district, of difficult access, and the\nmanufacture being still in a very imperfect state, the progress made\nwas for some time very slow.  Land containing coal and iron was deemed\nof very little value, as maybe inferred from the fact that in the year\n1765, Mr. Anthony Bacon, a man of much foresight, took a lease from\nLord Talbot, for 99 years, of the minerals under forty square miles of\ncountry surrounding the then insignificant hamlet of Merthyr Tydvil, at\nthe trifling rental of 200L. a-year.  There he erected iron works, and\nsupplied the Government with considerable quantities of cannon and iron\nfor different purposes; and having earned a competency, he retired from\nbusiness in 1782, subletting his mineral tract in four divisions--the\nDowlais, the Penydarran, the Cyfartha, and the Plymouth Works, north,\neast, west, and south, of Merthyr Tydvil.\n\nMr. Richard Crawshay became the lessee of what Mr. Mushet has called\n\"the Cyfartha flitch of the great Bacon domain.\"  There he proceeded to\ncarry on the works established by Mr. Bacon with increased spirit; his\nson William, whom he left in charge of the ironmongery store in London,\nsupplying him with capital to put into the iron works as fast as he\ncould earn it by the retail trade.  In 1787, we find Richard Crawshay\nmanufacturing with difficulty ten tons of bar-iron weekly, and it was\nof a very inferior character,[11]--the means not having yet been\ndevised at Cyfartha for malleableizing the pit-coal cast-iron with\neconomy or good effect.  Yet Crawshay found a ready market for all the\niron he could make, and he is said to have counted the gains of the\nforge-hammer close by his house at the rate of a penny a stroke.  In\ncourse of time he found it necessary to erect new furnaces, and, having\nadopted the processes invented by Henry Cort, he was thereby enabled\ngreatly to increase the production of his forges, until in 1812 we find\nhim stating to a committee of the House of Commons that he was making\nten thousand tons of bar-iron yearly, or an average produce of two\nhundred tons a week.  But this quantity, great though it was, has since\nbeen largely increased, the total produce of the Crawshay furnaces of\nCyfartha, Ynysfach, and Kirwan, being upwards of 50,000 tons of\nbar-iron yearly.\n\nThe distance of Merthyr from Cardiff, the nearest port, being\nconsiderable, and the cost of carriage being very great by reason of\nthe badness of the roads, Mr. Crawshay set himself to overcome this\ngreat impediment to the prosperity of the Merthyr Tydvil district; and,\nin conjunction with Mr. Homfray of the Penydarran Works, he planned and\nconstructed the canal[12] to Cardiff, the opening of which, in 1795,\ngave an immense impetus to the iron trade of the neighbourhood.\nNumerous other extensive iron works became established there, until\nMerthyr Tydvil attained the reputation of being at once the richest and\nthe dirtiest district in all Britain.  Mr. Crawshay became known in the\nwest of England as the \"Iron King,\" and was quoted as the highest\nauthority in all questions relating to the trade.  Mr. George Crawshay,\nrecently describing the founder of the family at a social meeting at\nNewcastle, said,--\"In these days a name like ours is lost in the\ninfinity of great manufacturing firms which exist through out the land;\nbut in those early times the man who opened out the iron district of\nWales stood upon an eminence seen by all the world.  It is preserved in\nthe traditions of the family that when the 'Iron King' used to drive\nfrom home in his coach-and-four into Wales, all the country turned out\nto see him, and quite a commotion took place when he passed through\nBristol on his way to the works.  My great grandfather was succeeded by\nhis son, and by his grandson; the Crawshays have followed one another\nfor four generations in the iron trade in Wales, and there they still\nstand at the head of the trade.\"  The occasion on which these words\nwere uttered was at a Christmas party, given to the men, about 1300 in\nnumber, employed at the iron works of Messrs. Hawks, Crawshay, and Co.,\nat Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  These works were founded in 1754 by William\nHawks, a blacksmith, whose principal trade consisted in making\nclaw-hammers for joiners.  He became a thriving man, and eventually a\nlarge manufacturer of bar-iron.  Partners joined him, and in the course\nof the changes wrought by time, one of the Crawshays, in 1842, became a\nprincipal partner in the firm.\n\nIllustrations of a like kind might be multiplied to any extent, showing\nthe growth in our own time of an iron aristocracy of great wealth and\ninfluence, the result mainly of the successful working of the\ninventions of the unfortunate and unrequited Henry Cort.  He has been\nthe very Tubal Cain of England--one of the principal founders of our\niron age.  To him we mainly owe the abundance of wrought-iron for\nmachinery, for steam-engines, and for railways, at one-third the price\nwe were before accustomed to pay to the foreigner.  We have by his\ninvention, not only ceased to be dependent upon other nations for our\nsupply of iron for tools, implements, and arms, but we have become the\ngreatest exporters of iron, producing more than all other European\ncountries combined.  In the opinion of Mr. Fairbairn of Manchester, the\ninventions of Henry Cort have already added six hundred millions\nsterling to the wealth of the kingdom, while they have given employment\nto some six hundred thousand working people during three generations.\nAnd while the great ironmasters, by freely availing themselves of his\ninventions, have been adding estate to estate, the only estate secured\nby Henry Cort was the little domain of six feet by two in which he lies\ninterred in Hampstead Churchyard.\n\n\n\n[1] Life of Brunel, p. 60.\n\n[2] SCRIVENOR, History of the Iron Trade, 169.\n\n[3] Although the iron manufacture had gradually been increasing since\nthe middle of the century, it was as yet comparatively insignificant in\namount.  Thus we find, from a statement by W. Wilkinson, dated Dec. 25,\n1791, contained in the memorandum-book of Wm. Reynolds of\nCoalbrookdale, that the produce in England and Scotland was then\nestimated to be\n\n                   Coke Furnaces.

There is no claim to any of them separately; the claim\nis to the reducing of the faggots of piled iron into bars, and the\nwelding of such bars by rollers instead of by forge-hammers.\"--Memoir\nof Henry Cort, in Mechanic's Magazine, 15 July, 1859, by Thomas\nWebster, M.A., F.R.S.\n\n[5] Letter by Mr. Truran in Mechanic's Magazine.\n\n[6] In the memorandum-book of Wm. Reynolds appears the following entry\non the subject:--\n\n\"Copy of a paper given to H. Cort, Esq.\n\n\"W. Reynolds saw H. C. in a trial which he made at Ketley, Dec. 17,\n1784, produce from the same pig both cold short and tough iron by a\nvariation of the process used in reducing them from the state of\ncast-iron to that of malleable or bar-iron; and in point of yield his\nprocesses were quite equal to those at Pitchford, which did not exceed\nthe proportion of 31 cwt. to the ton of bars.  The experiment was made\nby stamping and potting the blooms or loops made in his furnace, which\nthen produced a cold short iron; but when they were immediately\nshingled and drawn, the iron was of a black tough.\"\n\nThe Coalbrookdale ironmasters are said to have been deterred from\nadopting the process because of what was considered an excessive waste\nof the metal--about 25 per cent,--though, with greater experience, this\nwaste was very much diminished.\n\n[7] Mr. Webster, in the 'Case of Henry Cort,' published in the\nMechanic's Magazine (2 Dec. 1859), states that \"licences were taken at\nroyalties estimated to yield 27,500L. to the owners of the patents.\"\n\n[8] In the 'Case of Henry Cort,' by Mr. Webster, above referred to\n(Mechanic's Magazine, 2 Dec. 1859), it is stated that Adam Jellicoe\n\"committed suicide under the pressure of dread of exposure,\" but this\ndoes not appear to be confirmed by the accounts in the newspapers of\nthe day.  He died at his private dwelling-house, No. 14, Highbury\nPlace, Islingtonn, on the 30th August, 1789, after a fortnight's\nillness.\n\n[9] This is confirmed by the report of a House of Commons Committee on\nthe subject Mr. Davies Gilbert chairman, in which they say, \"Your\ncommittee have not been able to satisfy themselves that either of the\ntwo inventions, one for subjecting cast-iron to an operation termed\npuddling during its conversion to malleable iron, and the other for\npassing it through fluted or grooved rollers, were so novel in their\nprinciple or their application as fairly to entitle the petitioners\n[Mr. Cort's survivors] to a parliamentary reward.\"  It is, however,\nstated by Mr. Mushet that the evidence was not fairly taken by the\ncommittee--that they were overborne by the audacity of Mr. Samuel\nHomfray, one of the great Welsh ironmasters, whose statements were\naltogether at variance with known facts--and that it was under his\ninfluence that Mr. Gilbert drew up the fallacious report of the\ncommittee.  The illustrious James Watt, writing to Dr. Black in 1784,\nas to the iron produced by Cort's process, said, \"Though I cannot\nperfectly agree with you as to its goodness, yet there is much\ningenuity in the idea of forming the bars in that manner, which is the\nonly part of his process which has any pretensions to novelty....  Mr.\nCort has, as you observe, been most illiberally treated by the trade:\nthey are ignorant brutes; but he exposed himself to it by showing them\nthe process before it was perfect, and seeing his ignorance of the\ncommon operations of making iron, laughed at and despised him; yet they\nwill contrive by some dirty evasion to use his process, or such parts\nas they like, without acknowledging him in it.  I shall be glad to be\nable to be of any use to him.  Watts fellow-feeling was naturally\nexcited in favour of the plundered inventor, he himself having all his\nlife been exposed to the attacks of like piratical assailants.\n\n[10] Tenth Report of the Commissioners of Naval Inquiry.  See also\nReport of Select Committee on the 10th Naval Report.  May, 1805.\n\n[11] Mr. Mushet says of the early manufacture of iron at Merthyr Tydvil\nthat \"A modification of the charcoal refinery, a hollow fire, was\nworked with coke as a substitute for charcoal, but the bar-iron\nhammered from the produce was very inferior.\"  The pit-coal cast-iron\nwas nevertheless found of a superior quality for castings, being more\nfusible and more homogeneous than charcoal-iron.  Hence it was well\nadapted for cannon, which was for some time the principal article of\nmanufacture at the Welsh works.\n\n[12] It may be worthy of note that the first locomotive run upon a\nrailroad was that constructed by Trevithick for Mr. Homfray in 1803,\nwhich was employed to bring down metal from the furnaces to the Old\nForge.  The engine was taken off the road because the tram-plates were\nfound too weak to bear its weight without breaking.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nTHE SCOTCH IRON MANUFACTURE--DR. ROEBUCK DAVID MUSHET.\n\n\"Were public benefactors to be allowed to pass away, like hewers of\nwood and drawers of water, without commemoration, genius and enterprise\nwould be deprived of their most coveted distinction.\"--Sir Henry\nEnglefield.\n\n\nThe account given of Dr. Roebuck in a Cyclopedia of Biography, recently\npublished in Glasgow, runs as follows:--\"Roebuck, John, a physician and\nexperimental chemist, born at Sheffield, 1718; died, after ruining\nhimself by his projects, 1794.\"  Such is the short shrift which the man\nreceives who fails.  Had Dr. Roebuck wholly succeeded in his projects,\nhe would probably have been esteemed as among the greatest of\nScotland's benefactors.  Yet his life was not altogether a failure, as\nwe think will sufficiently appear from the following brief account of\nhis labours:--\n\nAt the beginning of last century, John Roebuck's father carried on the\nmanufacture of cutlery at Sheffield,[1] in the course of which he\nrealized a competency.  He intended his son to follow his own business,\nbut the youth was irresistibly attracted to scientific pursuits, in\nwhich his father liberally encouraged him; and he was placed first\nunder the care of Dr. Doddridge, at Northampton, and afterwards at the\nUniversity of Edinburgh, where he applied himself to the study of\nmedicine, and especially of chemistry, which was then attracting\nconsiderable attention at the principal seats of learning in Scotland.\nWhile residing at Edinburgh young Roebuck contracted many intimate\nfriendships with men who afterwards became eminent in literature, such\nas Hume and Robertson the historians, and the circumstance is supposed\nto have contributed not a little to his partiality in favour of\nScotland, and his afterwards selecting it as the field for his\nindustrial operations.\n\nAfter graduating as a physician at Leyden, Roebuck returned to England,\nand settled at Birmingham in the year 1745 for the purpose of\npractising his profession.  Birmingham was then a principal seat of the\nmetal manufacture, and its mechanics were reputed to be among the most\nskilled in Britain.  Dr. Roebuck's attention was early drawn to the\nscarcity and dearness of the material in which the mechanics worked,\nand he sought by experiment to devise some method of smelting iron\notherwise than by means of charcoal.  He had a laboratory fitted up in\nhis house for the purpose of prosecuting his inquiries, and there he\nspent every minute that he could spare from his professional labours.\nIt was thus that he invented the process of smelting iron by means of\npit-coal which he afterwards embodied in the patent hereafter to be\nreferred to.  At the same time he invented new methods of refining gold\nand silver, and of employing them in the arts, which proved of great\npractical value to the Birmingham trades-men, who made extensive use of\nthem in their various processes of manufacture.\n\nDr. Roebuck's inquiries had an almost exclusively practical direction,\nand in pursuing them his main object was to render them subservient to\nthe improvement of the industrial arts.  Thus he sought to devise more\neconomical methods of producing the various chemicals used in the\nBirmingham trade, such as ammonia, sublimate, and several of the acids;\nand his success was such as to induce him to erect a large laboratory\nfor their manufacture, which was conducted with complete success by his\nfriend Mr. Garbett.  Among his inventions of this character, was the\nmodern process of manufacturing vitriolic acid in leaden vessels in\nlarge quantities, instead of in glass vessels in small quantities as\nformerly practised.  His success led him to consider the project of\nestablishing a manufactory for the purpose of producing oil of vitriol\non a large scale; and, having given up his practice as a physician, he\nresolved, with his partner Mr. Garbett, to establish the proposed works\nin the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.  He removed to Scotland with that\nobject, and began the manufacture of vitriol at Prestonpans in the year\n1749.  The enterprise proved eminently lucrative, and, encouraged by\nhis success, Roebuck proceeded to strike out new branches of\nmanufacture.  He started a pottery for making white and brown ware,\nwhich eventually became established, and the manufacture exists in the\nsame neighbourhood to this day.\n\nThe next enterprise in which he became engaged was one of still greater\nimportance, though it proved eminently unfortunate in its results as\nconcerned himself.  While living at Prestonpans, he made the friendship\nof Mr. William Cadell, of Cockenzie, a gentleman who had for some time\nbeen earnestly intent on developing the industry of Scotland, then in a\nvery backward condition.  Mr. Cadell had tried, without success, to\nestablish a manufactory of iron; and, though he had heretofore failed,\nhe hoped that with the aid of Dr. Roebuck he might yet succeed.  The\nDoctor listened to his suggestions with interest, and embraced the\nproposed enterprise with zeal.  He immediately proceeded to organize a\ncompany, in which he was joined by a number of his friends and\nrelatives.  His next step was to select a site for the intended works,\nand make the necessary arrangements for beginning the manufacture of\niron.  After carefully examining the country on both sides of the\nForth, he at length made choice of a site on the banks of the river\nCarron, in Stirlingshire, where there was an abundant supply of wafer,\nand an inexhaustible supply of iron, coal, and limestone in the\nimmediate neighbourhood, and there Dr. Roebuck planted the first\nironworks in Scotland.\n\nIn order to carry them on with the best chances of success, he brought\na large number of skilled workmen from England, who formed a nucleus of\nindustry at Carron, where their example and improved methods of working\nserved to train the native labourers in their art.  At a subsequent\nperiod, Mr. Cadell, of Carronpark, also brought a number of skilled\nEnglish nail-makers into Scotland, and settled them in the village of\nCamelon, where, by teaching others, the business has become handed down\nto the present day.\n\nThe first furnace was blown at Carron on the first day of January,\n1760; and in the course of the same year the Carron Iron Works turned\nout 1500 tons of iron, then the whole annual produce of Scotland.\nOther furnaces were shortly after erected on improved plans, and the\nproduction steadily increased.  Dr. Roebuck was indefatigable in his\nendeavours to improve the manufacture, and he was one of the first, as\nwe have said, to revive the use of pit-coal in refining the ore, as\nappears from his patent of 1762.  He there describes his new process as\nfollows:--\"I melt pig or any kind of cast-iron in a hearth heated with\npit-coal by the blast of bellows, and work the metal until it is\nreduced to nature, which I take out of the fire and separate to pieces;\nthen I take the metal thus reduced to nature and expose it to the\naction of a hollow pit-coal fire, heated by the blast of bellows, until\nit is reduced to a loop, which I draw out under a common forge hammer\ninto bar-iron.\"  This method of manufacture was followed with success,\nthough for some time, as indeed to this day, the principal production\nof the Carron Works was castings, for which the peculiar quality of the\nScotch iron admirably adapts it.  The well-known Carronades,[2] or\n\"Smashers,\" as they were named, were cast in large numbers at the\nCarron Works.  To increase the power of his blowing apparatus, Dr.\nRoebuck called to his aid the celebrated Mr. Smeaton, the engineer, who\ncontrived and erected for him at Carron the most perfect apparatus of\nthe kind then in existence.  It may also be added, that out of the\nCarron enterprise, in a great measure, sprang the Forth and Clyde\nCanal, the first artificial navigation in Scotland.  The Carron\nCompany, with a view to securing an improved communication with\nGlasgow, themselves surveyed a line, which was only given up in\nconsequence of the determined opposition of the landowners; but the\nproject was again revived through their means, and was eventually\ncarried out after the designs of Smeaton and Brindley.\n\nWhile the Carron foundry was pursuing a career of safe prosperity, Dr.\nRoebuck's enterprise led him to embark in coal-mining, with the object\nof securing an improved supply of fuel for the iron works.  He became\nthe lessee of the Duke of Hamilton's extensive coal-mines at\nBoroughstoness, as well as of the salt-pans which were connected with\nthem.  The mansion of Kinneil went with the lease, and there Dr.\nRoebuck and his family took up their abode.  Kinneil House was formerly\na country seat of the Dukes of Hamilton, and is to this day a stately\nold mansion, reminding one of a French chateau.  Its situation is of\nremarkable beauty, its windows overlooking the broad expanse of the\nFirth of Forth, and commanding an extensive view of the country along\nits northern shores.  The place has become in a measure classical,\nKinneil House having been inhabited, since Dr. Roebuck's time, by\nDugald Stewart, who there wrote his Philosophical Essays.[3]  When Dr.\nRoebuck began to sink for coal at the new mines, he found it necessary\nto erect pumping-machinery of the most powerful kind that could be\ncontrived, in order to keep the mines clear of water.  For this purpose\nthe Newcomen engine, in its then state, was found insufficient; and\nwhen Dr. Roebuck's friend, Professor Black, of Edinburgh, informed him\nof a young man of his acquaintance, a mathematical instrument maker at\nGlasgow, having invented a steam-engine calculated to work with\nincreased power, speed, and economy, compared with Newcomen's; Dr.\nRoebuck was much interested, and shortly after entered into a\ncorrespondence with James Watt, the mathematical instrument maker\naforesaid on the subject.  The Doctor urged that Watt, who, up to that\ntime, had confined himself to models, should come over to Kinneil\nHouse, and proceed to erect a working; engine in one of the\noutbuildings.  The English workmen whom he had brought; to the Carron\nworks would, he justly thought, give Watt a better chance of success\nwith his engine than if made by the clumsy whitesmiths and blacksmiths\nof Glasgow, quite unaccustomed as they were to first-class work; and he\nproposed himself to cast the cylinders at Carron previous to Watt's\nintended visit to him at Kinneil.\n\nWatt paid his promised visit in May, 1768, and Roebuck was by this time\nso much interested in the invention, that the subject of his becoming a\npartner with Watt, with the object of introducing the engine into\ngeneral use, was seriously discussed.  Watt had been labouring at his\ninvention for several years, contending with many difficulties, but\nespecially with the main difficulty of limited means.  He had borrowed\nconsiderable sums of money from Dr. Black to enable him to prosecute\nhis experiments, and he felt the debt to hang like a millstone round\nhis neck.  Watt was a sickly, fragile man, and a constant sufferer from\nviolent headaches; besides he was by nature timid, desponding,\npainfully anxious, and easily cast down by failure.  Indeed, he was\nmore than once on the point of abandoning his invention in despair.  On\nthe other hand, Dr. Roebuck was accustomed to great enterprises, a bold\nand undaunted man, and disregardful of expense where he saw before him\na reasonable prospect of success.  His reputation as a practical\nchemist and philosopher, and his success as the founder of the\nPrestonpans Chemical Works and of the Carron Iron Works, justified the\nfriends of Watt in thinking that he was of all men the best calculated\nto help him at this juncture, and hence they sought to bring about a\nmore intimate connection between the two.  The result was that Dr.\nRoebuck eventually became a partner to the extent of two-thirds of the\ninvention, took upon him the debt owing by Watt to Dr. Black amounting\nto about 1200L., and undertook to find the requisite money to protect\nthe invention by means of a patent.  The necessary steps were taken\naccordingly and the patent right was secured by the beginning of 1769,\nthough the perfecting of his model cost Watt much further anxiety and\nstudy.\n\nIt was necessary for Watt occasionally to reside with Dr. Roebuck at\nKinneil House while erecting his first engine there.  It had been\noriginally intended to erect it in the neighbouring town of\nBoroughstoness, but as there might be prying eyes there, and Watt\nwished to do his work in privacy, determined \"not to puff,\" he at\nlength fixed upon an outhouse still standing, close behind the mansion,\nby the burnside in the glen, where there was abundance of water and\nsecure privacy.  Watt's extreme diffidence was often the subject of\nremark at Dr. Roebuck's fireside.  To the Doctor his anxiety seemed\nquite painful, and he was very much disposed to despond under\napparently trivial difficulties.  Roebuck's hopeful nature was his\nmainstay throughout.  Watt himself was ready enough to admit this; for,\nwriting to his friend Dr. Small, he once said, \"I have met with many\ndisappointments; and I must have sunk under the burthen of them if I\nhad not been supported by the friendship of Dr. Roebuck.\"\n\nBut more serious troubles were rapidly accumulating upon Dr. Roebuck\nhimself; and it was he, and not Watt, that sank under the burthen.  The\nprogress of Watt's engine was but slow, and long before it could be\napplied to the pumping of Roebuck's mines, the difficulties of the\nundertaking on which he had entered overwhelmed him.  The opening out\nof the principal coal involved a very heavy outlay, extending over many\nyears, during which he sank not only his own but his wife's fortune,\nand--what distressed him most of all--large sums borrowed from his\nrelatives and friends, which he was unable to repay.  The consequence\nwas, that he was eventually under the necessity of withdrawing his\ncapital from the refining works at Birmingham, and the vitriol works at\nPrestonpans.  At the same time, he transferred to Mr. Boulton of Soho\nhis entire interest in Watt's steam-engine, the value of which, by the\nway, was thought so small that it was not even included among the\nassets; Roebuck's creditors not estimating it as worth one farthing.\nWatt sincerely deplored his partner's misfortunes, but could not help\nhim.  \"He has been a most sincere and generous friend,\" said Watt, \"and\nis a truly worthy man.\"  And again, \"My heart bleeds for him, but I can\ndo nothing to help him:  I have stuck by him till I have much hurt\nmyself; I can do so no longer; my family calls for my care to provide\nfor them.\"  The later years of Dr. Roebuck's life were spent in\ncomparative obscurity; and he died in 1794, in his 76th year.\n\nHe lived to witness the success of the steam-engine, the opening up of\nthe Boroughstoness coal,[4] and the rapid extension of the Scotch iron\ntrade, though he shared in the prosperity of neither of those branches\nof industry.  He had been working ahead of his age, and he suffered for\nit.  He fell in the breach at the critical moment, and more fortunate\nmen marched over his body into the fortress which his enterprise and\nvalour had mainly contributed to win.  Before his great undertaking of\nthe Carron Works, Scotland was entirely dependent upon other countries\nfor its supply of iron.  In 1760, the first year of its operations, the\nwhole produce was 1500 tons.  In course of time other iron works were\nerected, at Clyde Cleugh, Muirkirk, and Devon--the managers and\noverseers of which, as well as the workmen, had mostly received their\ntraining and experience at Carron--until at length the iron trade of\nScotland has assumed such a magnitude that its manufacturers are\nenabled to export to England and other countries upwards of 500,000\ntons a-year.  How different this state of things from the time when\nraids were made across the Border for the purpose of obtaining a store\nof iron plunder to be carried back into Scotland!\n\nThe extraordinary expansion of the Scotch iron trade of late years has\nbeen mainly due to the discovery by David Mushet of the Black Band\nironstone in 1801, and the invention of the Hot Blast by James Beaumont\nNeilson in 1828.  David Mushet was born at Dalkeith, near Edinburgh, in\n1772.[5]  Like other members of his family he was brought up to\nmetal-founding.  At the age of nineteen he joined the staff of the\nClyde Iron Works, near Glasgow, at a time when the Company had only two\nblast-furnaces at work.  The office of accountant, which he held,\nprecluded him from taking any part in the manufacturing operations of\nthe concern.  But being of a speculative and ingenious turn of mind,\nthe remarkable conversions which iron underwent in the process of\nmanufacture very shortly began to occupy his attention.  The subject\nwas much discussed by the young men about the works, and they\nfrequently had occasion to refer to Foureroy's well-known book for the\npurpose of determining various questions of difference which arose\namong them in the course of their inquiries.  The book was, however, in\nmany respects indecisive and unsatisfactory; and, in 1793, when a\nreduction took place in the Company's staff, and David Mushet was left\nnearly the sole occupant of the office, he determined to study the\nsubject for himself experimentally, and in the first place to acquire a\nthorough knowledge of assaying, as the true key to the whole art of\niron-making.\n\nHe first set up his crucible upon the bridge of the reverberatory\nfurnace used for melting pig-iron, and filled it with a mixture\ncarefully compounded according to the formula of the books; but,\nnotwithstanding the shelter of a brick, placed before it to break the\naction of the flame, the crucible generally split in two, and not\nunfrequently melted and disappeared altogether.  To obtain better\nresults if possible, he next had recourse to the ordinary smith's fire,\ncarrying on his experiments in the evenings after office-hours.  He set\nhis crucible upon the fire on a piece of fire brick, opposite the\nnozzle of the bellows; covering the whole with coke, and then exciting\nthe flame by blowing.  This mode of operating produced somewhat better\nresults, but still neither the iron nor the cinder obtained resembled\nthe pig or scoria of the blast-furnace, which it was his ambition to\nimitate.  From the irregularity of the results, and the frequent\nfailure of the crucibles, he came to the conclusion that either his\nfurnace, or his mode of fluxing, was in fault, and he looked about him\nfor a more convenient means of pursuing his experiments.  A small\nsquare furnace had been erected in the works for the purpose of heating\nthe rivets used for the repair of steam-engine boilers; the furnace had\nfor its chimney a cast-iron pipe six or seven inches in diameter and\nnine feet long.  After a few trials with it, he raised the heat to such\nan extent that the lower end of the pipe was melted off, without\nproducing any very satisfactory results on the experimental crucible,\nand his operations were again brought to a standstill.  A chimney of\nbrick having been substituted for the cast-iron pipe, he was, however,\nenabled to proceed with his trials.\n\nHe continued to pursue his experiments in assaying for about two years,\nduring which he had been working entirely after the methods described\nin books; but, feeling the results still unsatisfactory, he determined\nto borrow no more from the books, but to work out a system of his own,\nwhich should ensure results similar to those produced at the\nblast-furnace.  This he eventually succeeded in effecting by numerous\nexperiments performed in the night; as his time was fully occupied by\nhis office-duties during the day.  At length these patient experiments\nbore their due fruits.  David Mushet became the most skilled assayer at\nthe works; and when a difficulty occurred in smelting a quantity of new\nironstone which had been contracted for, the manager himself resorted\nto the bookkeeper for advice and information; and the skill and\nexperience which he had gathered during his nightly labours, enabled\nhim readily and satisfactorily to solve the difficulty and suggest a\nsuitable remedy.  His reward for this achievement was the permission,\nwhich was immediately granted him by the manager, to make use of his\nown assay-furnace, in which he thenceforward continued his\ninvestigations, at the same time that he instructed the manager's son\nin the art of assaying.  This additional experience proved of great\nbenefit to him; and he continued to prosecute his inquiries with much\nzeal, sometimes devoting entire nights to experiments in assaying,\nroasting and cementing iron-ores and ironstone, decarbonating cast-iron\nfor steel and bar-iron, and various like operations.  His general\npractice, however, at that time was, to retire between two and three\no'clock in the morning, leaving directions with the engine-man to call\nhim at half-past five, so as to be present in the office at six.  But\nthese praiseworthy experiments were brought to a sudden end, as thus\ndescribed by himself:--\n\n\"In the midst of my career of investigation,\" says he,[6] \"and without\na cause being assigned, I was stopped short.  My furnaces, at the order\nof the manager, were pulled in pieces, and an edict was passed that\nthey should never be erected again.  Thus terminated my researches at\nthe Clyde Iron Works.  It happened at a time when I was interested--and\nI had been two years previously occupied--in an attempt to convert\ncast-iron into steel, without fusion, by a process of cementation,\nwhich had for its object the dispersion or absorption of the\nsuperfluous carbon contained in the cast-iron,--an object which at that\ntime appeared to me of so great importance, that, with the consent of a\nfriend, I erected an assay and cementing Furnace at the distance of\nabout two miles from the Clyde Works.  Thither I repaired at night, and\nsometimes at the breakfast and dinner hours during the day.  This plan\nof operation was persevered in for the whole of one summer, but was\nfound too uncertain and laborious to be continued.  At the latter end\nof the year 1798 I left my chambers, and removed from the Clyde Works\nto the distance of about a mile, where I constructed several furnaces\nfor assaying and cementing, capable of exciting a greater temperature\nthan any to which I before had access; and thus for nearly two years I\ncontinued to carry on my investigations connected with iron and the\nalloys of the metals.\n\n\"Though operating in a retired manner, and holding little communication\nwith others, my views and opinions upon the RATIONALE of iron-making\nspread over the establishment.  I was considered forward in affecting\nto see and explain matters in a different way from others who were much\nmy seniors, and who were content to be satisfied with old methods of\nexplanation, or with no explanation at all.....  Notwithstanding these\nearly reproaches, I have lived to see the nomenclature of my youth\nfurnish a vocabulary of terms in the art of iron-making, which is used\nby many of the ironmasters of the present day with freedom and effect,\nin communicating with each other on the subject of their respective\nmanufactures.  Prejudices seldom outlive the generation to which they\nbelong, when opposed by a more rational system of explanation.  In this\nrespect, Time (as my Lord Bacon says) is the greatest of all innovators.\n\n\"In a similar manner, Time operated in my favour in respect to the\nBlack Band Ironstone.[7]  The discovery of this was made in 1801, when\nI was engaged in erecting for myself and partners the Calder Iron\nWorks.  Great prejudice was excited against me by the ironmasters and\nothers of that day in presuming to class the WILD COALS of the country\n(as Black Band was called) with ironstone fit and proper for the blast\nfurnace.  Yet that discovery has elevated Scotland to a considerable\nrank among the iron-making nations of Europe, with resources still in\nstore that may be considered inexhaustible.  But such are the\nconsolatory effects of Time, that the discoverer of 1801 is no longer\nconsidered the intrusive visionary of the laboratory, but the\nacknowledged benefactor of his country at large, and particularly of an\nextensive class of coal and mine proprietors and iron masters, who have\nderived, and are still deriving, great wealth from this important\ndiscovery; and who, in the spirit of grateful acknowledgment, have\npronounced it worthy of a crown of gold, or a monumental record on the\nspot where the discovery was first made.\n\n\"At an advanced period of life, such considerations are soothing and\nsatisfactory.  Many under similar circumstances have not, in their own\nlifetime, had that measure of justice awarded to them by their country\nto which they were equally entitled.  I accept it, however, as a boon\njustly due to me, and as an equivalent in some degree for that\nlaborious course of investigation which I had prescribed for myself,\nand which, in early life, was carried on under circumstances of\npersonal exposure and inconvenience, which nothing but a frame of iron\ncould have supported.  They atone also, in part, for that\ndisappointment sustained in early life by the speculative habits of one\npartner, and the constitutional nervousness of another, which\neventually occasioned my separation from the Calder Iron Works, and\nlost me the possession of extensive tracts of Black Band iron-stone,\nwhich I had secured while the value of the discovery was known only to\nmyself.\"\n\nMr. Mushet published the results of his laborious investigations in a\nseries of papers in the Philosophical Magazine,--afterwards reprinted\nin a collected form in 1840 under the title of \"Papers on Iron and\nSteel.\"  These papers are among the most valuable original\ncontributions to the literature of the iron-manufacture that have yet\nbeen given to the world.  They contain the germs of many inventions and\ndiscoveries in iron and steel, some of which were perfected by Mr.\nMushet himself, while others were adopted and worked out by different\nexperimenters.  In 1798 some of the leading French chemists were\nendeavouring to prove by experiment that steel could be made by contact\nof the diamond with bar-iron in the crucible, the carbon of the diamond\nbeing liberated and entering into combination with the iron, forming\nsteel.  In the animated controversy which occurred on the subject, Mr.\nMushet's name was brought into considerable notice; one of the subjects\nof his published experiments having been the conversion of bar-iron\ninto steel in the crucible by contact with regulated proportions of\ncharcoal.  The experiments which he made in connection with this\ncontroversy, though in themselves unproductive of results, led to the\nimportant discovery by Mr. Mushet of the certain fusibility of\nmalleable iron at a suitable temperature.\n\nAmong the other important results of Mr. Mushet's lifelong labours, the\nfollowing may be summarily mentioned:  The preparation of steel from\nbar-iron by a direct process, combining the iron with carbon; the\ndiscovery of the beneficial effects of oxide of manganese on iron and\nsteel; the use of oxides of iron in the puddling-furnace in various\nmodes of appliance; the production of pig-iron from the blast-furnace,\nsuitable for puddling, without the intervention of the refinery; and\nthe application of the hot blast to anthracite coal in iron-smelting.\nFor the process of combining iron with carbon for the production of\nsteel, Mr. Mushet took out a patent in November, 1800; and many years\nafter, when he had discovered the beneficial effects of oxide of\nmanganese on steel, Mr. Josiah Heath founded upon it his celebrated\npatent for the making of cast-steel, which had the effect of raising\nthe annual production of that metal in Sheffield from 3000 to 100,000\ntons.  His application of the hot blast to anthracite coal, after a\nprocess invented by him and adopted by the Messrs. Hill of the Plymouth\nIron Works, South Wales, had the effect of producing savings equal to\nabout 20,000L. a year at those works; and yet, strange to say, Mr.\nMushet himself never received any consideration for his invention.\n\nThe discovery of Titanium by Mr. Mushet in the hearth of a\nblast-furnace in 1794 would now be regarded as a mere isolated fact,\ninasmuch as Titanium was not placed in the list of recognised metals\nuntil Dr. Wollaston, many years later, ascertained its qualities.  But\nin connection with the fact, it may be mentioned that Mr. Mushet's\nyoungest son, Robert, reasoning on the peculiar circumstances of the\ndiscovery in question, of which ample record is left, has founded upon\nit his Titanium process, which is expected by him eventually to\nsupersede all other methods of manufacturing steel, and to reduce very\nmaterially the cost of its production.\n\nWhile he lived, Mr. Mushet was a leading authority on all matters\nconnected with Iron and Steel, and he contributed largely to the\nscientific works of his time.  Besides his papers in the Philosophical\nJournal, he wrote the article \"Iron\" for Napiers Supplement to the\nEncyclopaedia Britannica; and the articles \"Blast Furnace\" and \"Blowing\nMachine\" for Rees's Cyclopaedia.  The two latter articles had a\nconsiderable influence on the opposition to the intended tax upon iron\nin 1807, and were frequently referred to in the discussions on the\nsubject in Parliament.  Mr. Mushet died in 1847.\n\n\n\n[1] Dr. Roebuck's grandson, John Arthur Roebuck, by a singular\ncoincidence, at present represents Sheffield in the British Parliament.\n\n[2] The carronade was invented by General Robert Melville [Mr. Nasmyth\nsays it was by Miller of Dalswinton], who proposed it for discharging\n68 lb, shot with low charges of powder, in order to produce the\nincreased splintering or SMASHING effects which were known to result\nfrom such practice.  The first piece of the kind was cast at the Carron\nFoundry, in 1779, and General Melville's family have now in their\npossession a small model of this gun, with the inscription:--\"Gift of\nthe Carron Company to Lieutenant-general Melville, inventor of the\nsmashers and lesser carronades, for solid, ship, shell, and carcass\nshot, &c.  First used against French ships in 1779.\"\n\n[3] Wilkie the painter once paid him a visit there while in Scotland\nstudying the subject of his \"Penny Wedding;\" and Dugald Stewart found\nfor him the old farm-house with the cradle-chimney, which he introduced\nin that picture.  But Kinneil House has had its imaginary inhabitants\nas well as its real ones, the ghost of a Lady Lilburn, once an occupant\nof the place, still \"haunting\" some of the unoccupied chambers.  Dugald\nStewart told Wilkie one night, as he was going to bed, of the unearthly\nwailings which he himself had heard proceeding from the ancient\napartments; but to him at least they had been explained by the door\nopening out upon the roof being blown in on gusty nights, when a\njarring and creaking noise was heard all over the house.  One advantage\nderived from the house being \"haunted\" was, that the garden was never\nbroken into, and the winter apples and stores were at all times kept\nsafe from depredation in the apartments of the Lady Lilburn.\n\n[4] Dr. Roebuck had been on the brink of great good fortune, but he did\nnot know it.  Mr. Ralph Moore, in his \"Papers on the Blackband\nIronstones\" (Glasgow, 1861), observes:--\"Strange to say, he was leaving\nbehind him, almost as the roof of one of the seams of coal which he\nworked, a valuable blackband ironstone, upon which Kinneil Iron Works\nare now founded.  The coal-field continued to be worked until the\naccidental discovery of the blackband about 1845.  The old coal-pits\nare now used for working the ironstone.\"\n\n[5] The Mushets are an old Kincardine family; but they were almost\nextinguished by the plague in the reign of Charles the Second.  Their\nnumbers were then reduced to two; one of whom remained at Kincardine,\nand the other, a clergyman, the Rev. George Mushet, accompanied\nMontrose as chaplain.  He is buried in Kincardine churchyard.\n\n[6] Papers on Iron and Steel.  By David Mushet.  London, 1840.\n\n[7] This valuable description of iron ore was discovered by Mr. Mushet,\nas he afterwards informs us (Papers on Iron and Steel, 121), in the\nyear 1801, when crossing the river Calder, in the parish of Old\nMonkland.  Having subjected a specimen which he found in the river-bed\nto the test of his crucible, he satisfied himself as to its properties,\nand proceeded to ascertain its geological position and relations.  He\nshortly found that it belonged to the upper part of the coal-formation,\nand hence he designated it carboniferous ironstone.  He prosecuted his\nresearches, and found various rich beds of the mineral distributed\nthroughout the western counties of Scotland.  On analysis, it was found\nto contain a little over 50 per cent.  of protoxide of iron.  The coaly\nmatter it contained was not its least valuable ingredient; for by the\naid of the hot blast it was afterwards found practicable to smelt it\nalmost without any addition of coal.  Seams of black band have since\nbeen discovered and successfully worked in Edinburghshire,\nStaffordshire, and North Wales.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nINVENTION OF THE HOT BLAST--JAMES BEAUMONT NEILSON.\n\n\"Whilst the exploits of the conqueror and the intrigues of the\ndemagogue are faithfully preserved through a succession of ages, the\npersevering and unobtrusive efforts of genius, developing the best\nblessings of the Deity to man, are often consigned to oblivion.\"--David\nMushet.\n\n\nThe extraordinary value of the Black Band ironstone was not at first\nduly recognised, perhaps not even by Mr. Mushet himself.  For several\nyears after its discovery by him, its use was confined to the Calder\nIron Works, where it was employed in mixture with other ironstones of\nthe argillaceous class.  It was afterwards partially used at the Clyde\nIron Works, but nowhere else, a strong feeling of prejudice being\nentertained against it on the part of the iron trade generally.  It was\nnot until the year 1825 that the Monkland Company used it alone,\nwithout any other mixture than the necessary quantity of limestone for\na flux.  \"The success of this Company,\" says Mr. Mushet, \"soon gave\nrise to the Gartsherrie and Dundyvan furnaces, in the midst of which\nprogress came the use of raw pit-coal and the Hot Blast--the latter one\nof the greatest discoveries in metallurgy of the present age, and,\nabove every other process, admirably adapted for smelting the Blackband\nironstone.\"  From the introduction of this process the extraordinary\ndevelopment of the iron-manufacture of Scotland may be said to date;\nand we accordingly propose to devote the present chapter to an account\nof its meritorious inventor.\n\nJames Beaumont Neilson was born at Shettleston, a roadside village\nabout three miles eastward of Glasgow, on the 22nd of June, 1792.  His\nparents belonged to the working class.  His father's earnings during\nmany laborious years of his life did not exceed sixteen shillings a\nweek.  He had been bred to the trade of a mill-wright, and was for some\ntime in the employment of Dr. Roebuck as an engine-wright at his\ncolliery near Boroughstoness.  He was next employed in a like capacity\nby Mr. Beaumont, the mineral-manager of the collieries of Mrs.\nCunningham of Lainshaw, near Irvine in Ayrshire; after which he was\nappointed engine-wright at Ayr, and subsequently at the Govan Coal\nWorks near Glasgow, where he remained until his death.  It was while\nworking at the Irvine Works that he first became acquainted with his\nfuture wife, Marion Smith, the daughter of a Renfrewshire bleacher, a\nwoman remarkable through life for her clever, managing, and industrious\nhabits.  She had the charge of Mrs. Cunningham's children for some time\nafter the marriage of that lady to Mr. Beaumont, and it was in\ncompliment to her former mistress and her husband that she named her\nyoungest son James Beaumont after the latter.\n\nThe boy's education was confined to the common elements of reading,\nwriting, and arithmetic, which he partly acquired at the parish school\nof Strathbungo near Glasgow, and partly at the Chapel School, as it was\ncalled, in the Gorbals at Glasgow.  He had finally left school before\nhe was fourteen.  Some time before he left, he had been partially set\nto work, and earned four shillings a week by employing a part of each\nday in driving a small condensing engine which his father had put up in\na neighbouring quarry.  After leaving school, he was employed for two\nyears as a gig boy on one of the winding engines at the Govan colliery.\nHis parents now considered him of fit age to be apprenticed to some\nspecial trade, and as Beaumont had much of his father's tastes for\nmechanical pursuits, it was determined to put him apprentice to a\nworking engineer.  His elder brother John was then acting as engineman\nat Oakbank near Glasgow, and Beaumont was apprenticed under him to\nlearn the trade.  John was a person of a studious and serious turn of\nmind, and had been strongly attracted to follow the example of the\nbrothers Haldane, who were then exciting great interest by their\npreaching throughout the North; but his father set his face against his\nson's \"preaching at the back o' dikes,\" as he called it; and so John\nquietly settled down to his work.  The engine which the two brothers\nmanaged was a very small one, and the master and apprentice served for\nengineman and fireman.  Here the youth worked for three years,\nemploying his leisure hours in the evenings in remedying the defects of\nhis early education, and endeavouring to acquire a knowledge of English\ngrammar, drawing, and mathematics.\n\nOn the expiry of his apprenticeship, Beaumont continued for a time to\nwork under his brother as journeyman at a guinea a week; after which,\nin 1814, he entered the employment of William Taylor, coal-master at\nIrvine, and he was appointed engine-wright of the colliery at a salary\nof from 70L. to 80L. a year.  One of the improvements which he\nintroduced in the working of the colliery, while he held that office,\nwas the laying down of an edge railway of cast-iron, in lengths of\nthree feet, from the pit to the harbour of Irvine, a distance of three\nmiles.  At the age of 23 he married his first wife, Barbara\nMontgomerie, an Irvine lass, with a \"tocher\" of 250L.  This little\nprovision was all the more serviceable to him, as his master, Taylor,\nbecoming unfortunate in business, he was suddenly thrown out of\nemployment, and the little fortune enabled the newly-married pair to\nhold their heads above water till better days came round.  They took a\nhumble tenement, consisting of a room and a kitchen, in the Cowcaddens,\nGlasgow, where their first child was born.\n\nAbout this time a gas-work, the first in Glasgow, was projected, and\nthe company having been formed, the directors advertised for a\nsuperintendent and foreman, to whom they offered a \"liberal salary.\"\nThough Beaumont had never seen gaslight before, except at the\nillumination of his father's colliery office after the Peace of Amiens,\nwhich was accomplished in a very simple and original manner, without\neither condenser, purifier, or gas-holder, and though he knew nothing\nof the art of gas-making, he had the courage to apply for the\nsituation.  He was one of twenty candidates, and the fortunate one; and\nin August, 1817, we find him appointed foreman of the Glasgow Gasworks,\nfor five years, at the salary of 90L. a year.  Before the expiry of his\nterm he was reappointed for six years more, at the advanced salary of\n200L., with the status of manager and engineer of the works.  His\nsalary was gradually increased to 400L. a year, with a free\ndwelling-house, until 1847, when, after a faithful service of thirty\nyears, during which he had largely extended the central works, and\nerected branch works in Tradeston and Partick, he finally resigned the\nmanagement.\n\nThe situation of manager of the Glasgow Gas-works was in many respects\nwell suited for the development of Mr. Neilson's peculiar abilities.\nIn the first place it afforded him facilities for obtaining theoretical\nas well as practical knowledge in Chemical Science, of which he was a\ndiligent student at the Andersonian University, as well as of Natural\nPhilosophy and Mathematics in their higher branches.  In the next place\nit gave free scope for his ingenuity in introducing improvements in the\nmanufacture of gas, then in its infancy.  He was the first to employ\nclay retorts; and he introduced sulphate of iron as a self-acting\npurifier, passing the gas through beds of charcoal to remove its oily\nand tarry elements.  The swallow-tail or union jet was also his\ninvention, and it has since come into general use.\n\nWhile managing the Gas-works, one of Mr. Neilson's labours of love was\nthe establishment and direction by him of a Workmen's Institution for\nmutual improvement.  Having been a workman himself, and experienced the\ndisadvantages of an imperfect education in early life, as well as the\nbenefits arising from improved culture in later years, he desired to\nimpart some of these advantages to the workmen in his employment, who\nconsisted chiefly of persons from remote parts of the Highlands or from\nIreland.  Most of them could not even read, and his principal\ndifficulty consisted in persuading them that it was of any use to\nlearn.  For some time they resisted his persuasions to form a Workmen's\nInstitution, with a view to the establishment of a library, classes,\nand lectures, urging as a sufficient plea for not joining it, that they\ncould not read, and that books would be of no use to them.  At last Mr.\nNeilson succeeded, though with considerable difficulty, in inducing\nfourteen of the workmen to adopt his plan.  Each member was to\ncontribute a small sum monthly, to be laid out in books, the Gas\nCompany providing the members with a comfortable room in which they\nmight meet to read and converse in the evenings instead of going to the\nalehouse.  The members were afterwards allowed to take the books home\nto read, and the room was used for the purpose of conversation on the\nsubjects of the books read by them, and occasionally for lectures\ndelivered by the members themselves on geography, arithmetic,\nchemistry, and mechanics.  Their numbers increased so that the room in\nwhich they met became insufficient for their accommodation, when the\nGas Company provided them with a new and larger place of meeting,\ntogether with a laboratory and workshop.  In the former they studied\npractical chemistry, and in the latter they studied practical\nmechanics, making for themselves an air pump and an electrifying\nmachine, as well as preparing the various models used in the course of\nthe lectures.  The effects on the workmen were eminently beneficial,\nand the institution came to be cited as among the most valuable of its\nkind in the kingdom.[1]\n\nMr. Neilson throughout watched carefully over its working, and exerted\nhimself in all ways to promote its usefulness, in which he had the\nzealous co-operation of the leading workmen themselves, and the\ngratitude of all.  On the opening of the new and enlarged rooms in\n1825, we find him delivering an admirable address, which was thought\nworthy of republication, together with the reply of George Sutherland,\none of the workmen, in which Mr. Neilson's exertions as its founder and\nchief supporter were gratefully and forcibly expressed.[2]\n\nIt was during the period of his connection with the Glasgow Gas-works\nthat Mr. Neilson directed his attention to the smelting of iron.  His\nviews in regard to the subject were at first somewhat crude, as appears\nfrom a paper read by him before the Glasgow Philosophical Society early\nin 1825.  It appears that in the course of the preceding year his\nattention had been called to the subject by an iron-maker, who asked\nhim if he thought it possible to purify the air blown into the blast\nfurnaces, in like manner as carburetted hydrogen gas was purified.  The\nironmaster supposed that it was the presence of sulphur in the air that\ncaused blast-furnaces to work irregularly, and to make bad iron in the\nsummer months.  Mr. Neilson was of opinion that this was not the true\ncause, and he was rather disposed to think it attributable to the want\nof a due proportion of oxygen in summer, when the air was more\nrarefied, besides containing more aqueous vapour than in winter.  He\ntherefore thought the true remedy was in some way or other to throw in\na greater proportion of oxygen; and he suggested that, in order to dry\nthe air, it should be passed, on its way to the furnace, through two\nlong tunnels containing calcined lime.  But further inquiry served to\ncorrect his views, and eventually led him to the true theory of\nblasting.\n\nShortly after, his attention was directed by Mr. James Ewing to a\ndefect in one of the Muirkirk blast-furnaces, situated about half a\nmile distant from the blowing-engine, which was found not to work so\nwell as others which were situated close to it.  The circumstances of\nthe case led Mr. Neilson to form the opinion that, as air increases in\nvolume according to temperature, if he were to heat it by passing it\nthrough a red-hot vessel, its volume would be increased, according to\nthe well-known law, and the blast might thus be enabled to do more duty\nin the distant furnace.  He proceeded to make a series of experiments\nat the Gas-works, trying the effect of heated air on the illuminating\npower of gas, by bringing up a stream of it in a tube so as to surround\nthe gas-burner.  He found that by this means the combustion of the gas\nwas rendered more intense, and its illuminating power greatly\nincreased.  He proceeded to try a similar experiment on a common\nsmith's fire, by blowing the fire with heated air, and the effect was\nthe same; the fire was much more brilliant, and accompanied by an\nunusually intense degree of heat.\n\nHaving obtained such marked results by these small experiments, it\nnaturally occurred to him that a similar increase in intensity of\ncombustion and temperature would attend the application of the process\nto the blast-furnace on a large scale; but being only a gas-maker, he\nhad the greatest difficulty in persuading any ironmaster to permit him\nto make the necessary experiment's with blast-furnaces actually at\nwork.  Besides, his theory was altogether at variance with the\nestablished practice, which was to supply air as cold as possible, the\nprevailing idea being that the coldness of the air in winter was the\ncause of the best iron being then produced.  Acting on these views, the\nefforts of the ironmasters had always been directed to the cooling of\nthe blast, and various expedients were devised for the purpose.  Thus\nthe regulator was painted white, as being the coolest colour; the air\nwas passed over cold water, and in some cases the air pipes were even\nsurrounded by ice, all with the object of keeping the blast cold.\nWhen, therefore, Mr. Neilson proposed entirely to reverse the process,\nand to employ hot instead of cold blast, the incredulity of the\nironmasters may well be imagined.  What!  Neilson, a mere maker of gas,\nundertake to instruct practical men in the manufacture of iron!  And to\nsuppose that heated air can be used for the purpose!  It was\npresumption in the extreme, or at best the mere visionary idea of a\nperson altogether unacquainted with the subject!\n\nAt length, however, Mr. Neilson succeeded in inducing Mr. Charles\nMacintosh of Crossbasket, and Mr. Colin Dunlop of the Clyde Iron Works,\nto allow him to make a trial of the hot air process.  In the first\nimperfect attempts the air was heated to little more than 80 degrees\nFahrenheit, yet the results were satisfactory, and the scoriae from the\nfurnace evidently contained less iron.  He was therefore desirous of\ntrying his plan upon a more extensive scale, with the object, if\npossible, of thoroughly establishing the soundness of his principle.\nIn this he was a good deal hampered even by those ironmasters who were\nhis friends, and had promised him the requisite opportunities for\nmaking a fair trial of the new process.  They strongly objected to his\nmaking the necessary alterations in the furnaces, and he seemed to be\nas far from a satisfactory experiment as ever.  In one instance, where\nhe had so far succeeded as to be allowed to heat the blast-main, he\nasked permission to introduce deflecting plates in the main or to put a\nbend in the pipe, so as to bring the blast more closely against the\nheated sides of the pipe, and also increase the area of heating\nsurface, in order to raise the temperature to a higher point; but this\nwas refused, and it was said that if even a bend were put in the pipe\nthe furnace would stop working.  These prejudices proved a serious\ndifficulty in the way of our inventor, and several more years passed\nbefore he was allowed to put a bend in the blast-main.  After many\nyears of perseverance, he was, however, at length enabled to work out\nhis plan into a definite shape at the Clyde Iron Works, and its\npractical value was at once admitted.  At the meeting of the Mechanical\nEngineers' Society held in May, 1859, Mr. Neilson explained that his\ninvention consisted solely in the principle of heating the blast\nbetween the engine and the furnace, and was not associated with any\nparticular construction of the intermediate heating apparatus.  This,\nhe said, was the cause of its success; and in some respects it\nresembled the invention of his countryman, James Watt, who, in\nconnection with the steam-engine, invented the plan of condensing the\nsteam in a separate vessel, and was successful in maintaining his\ninvention by not limiting it to any particular construction of the\ncondenser.  On the same occasion he took the opportunity of\nacknowledging the firmness with which the English ironmasters had stood\nby him when attempts were made to deprive him of the benefits of his\ninvention; and to them he acknowledged he was mainly indebted for the\nsuccessful issue of the severe contests he had to undergo.  For there\nwere, of course, certain of the ironmasters, both English and Scotch,\nsupporters of the cause of free trade in others' inventions, who sought\nto resist the patent, after it had come into general use, and had been\nrecognised as one of the most valuable improvements of modern times.[3]\n\nThe patent was secured in 1828 for a term of fourteen years; but, as\nMr. Neilson did not himself possess the requisite capital to enable him\nto perfect the invention, or to defend it if attacked, he found it\nnecessary to invite other gentlemen, able to support him in these\nrespects, to share its profits; retaining for himself only three-tenths\nof the whole.  His partners were Mr. Charles Macintosh, Mr. Colin\nDunlop, and Mr. John Wilson of Dundyvan.  The charge made by them was\nonly a shilling a ton for all iron produced by the new process; this\nlow rate being fixed in order to ensure the introduction of the patent\ninto general use, as well as to reduce to a minimum the temptations of\nthe ironmasters to infringe it.\n\nThe first trials of the process were made at the blast-furnaces of\nClyde and Calder; from whence the use of the hot blast gradually\nextended to the other iron-mining districts.  In the course of a few\nyears every furnace in Scotland, with one exception (that at Carron),\nhad adopted the improvement; while it was also employed in half the\nfurnaces of England and Wales, and in many of the furnaces on the\nContinent and in America.  In course of time, and with increasing\nexperience, various improvements were introduced in the process, more\nparticularly in the shape of the air-heating vessels; the last form\nadopted being that of a congeries of tubes, similar to the tubular\narrangement in the boiler of the locomotive, by which the greatest\nextent of heating surface was provided for the thorough heating of the\nair.  By these modifications the temperature of the air introduced into\nthe furnace has been raised from 240 degrees to 600 degrees, or the\ntemperature of melting lead.  To protect the nozzle of the air-pipe as\nit entered the furnace against the action of the intense heat to which\nit was subjected, a spiral pipe for a stream of cold water constantly\nto play in has been introduced within the sides of the iron tuyere\nthrough which the nozzle passes; by which means the tuyere is kept\ncomparatively cool, while the nozzle of the air-pipe is effectually\nprotected.[4]\n\nThis valuable invention did not escape the usual fate of successful\npatents, and it was on several occasions the subject of protracted\nlitigation.  The first action occurred in 1832; but the objectors\nshortly gave in, and renewed their licence.  In 1839, when the process\nhad become generally adopted throughout Scotland, and, indeed, was\nfound absolutely essential for smelting the peculiar ores of that\ncountry--more especially Mushet's Black Band--a powerful combination\nwas formed amongst the ironmasters to resist the patent.  The\nlitigation which ensued extended over five years, during which period\nsome twenty actions were proceeding in Scotland, and several in\nEngland.  Three juries sat upon the subject at different times, and on\nthree occasions appeals were carried to the House of Lords.  One jury\ntrial occupied ten days, during which a hundred and two witnesses were\nexamined; the law costs on both sides amounting, it is supposed, to at\nleast 40,000L.  The result was, that the novelty and merit of Mr.\nNeilson's invention were finally established, and he was secured in the\nenjoyment of the patent right.\n\nWe are gratified to add, that, though Mr. Neilson had to part with\ntwo-thirds of the profits of the invention to secure the capital and\ninfluence necessary to bring it into general use, he realized\nsufficient to enable him to enjoy the evening of his life in peace and\ncomfort.  He retired from active business to an estate which he\npurchased in 1851 in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, where he is found\nready to lend a hand in every good work--whether in agricultural\nimprovement, railway extension, or the moral and social good of those\nabout him.  Mindful of the success of his Workmen's Institution at the\nGlasgow Gas-Works, he has, almost at his own door, erected a similar\nInstitution for the use of the parish in which his property is\nsituated, the beneficial effects of which have been very marked in the\ndistrict.  We may add that Mr. Neilson's merits have been recognised by\nmany eminent bodies--by the Institution of Civil Engineers, the\nChemical Society, and others--the last honour conferred on him being\nhis election as a Member of the Royal Society in 1846.\n\nThe invention of the hot blast, in conjunction with the discovery of\nthe Black Band ironstone, has had an extra ordinary effect upon the\ndevelopment of the iron-manufacture of Scotland.  The coals of that\ncountry are generally unfit for coking, and lose as much as 55 per\ncent. in the process.  But by using the hot blast, the coal could be\nsent to the blast-furnace in its raw state, by which a large saving of\nfuel was effected.[5]  Even coals of an inferior quality were by its\nmeans made available for the manufacture of iron.  But one of the\npeculiar qualities of the Black Band ironstone is that in many cases it\ncontains sufficient coaly matter for purposes of calcination, without\nany admixture of coal whatever.  Before its discovery, all the iron\nmanufactured in Scotland was made from clay-band; but the use of the\nlatter has in a great measure been discontinued wherever a sufficient\nsupply of Black Band can be obtained.  And it is found to exist very\nextensively in most of the midland Scotch counties,--the coal and iron\nmeasures stretching in a broad belt from the Firth of Forth to the\nIrish Channel at the Firth of Clyde.  At the time when the hot blast\nwas invented, the fortunes of many of the older works were at a low\nebb, and several of them had been discontinued; but they were speedily\nbrought to life again wherever Black Band could be found.  In 1829, the\nyear after Neilson's patent was taken out, the total make of Scotland\nwas 29,000 tons.  As fresh discoveries of the mineral were made, in\nAyrshire and Lanarkshire, new works were erected, until, in 1845, we\nfind the production of Scotch pig-iron had increased to 475,000 tons.\nIt has since increased to upwards of a million of tons,\nnineteen-twentieths of which are made from Black Band ironstone.[6]\n\nEmployment has thus been given to vast numbers of our industrial\npopulation, and the wealth and resources of the Scotch iron districts\nhave been increased to an extraordinary extent.  During the last year\nthere were 125 furnaces in blast throughout Scotland, each employing\nabout 400 men in making an average of 200 tons a week; and the money\ndistributed amongst the workmen may readily be computed from the fact\nthat, under the most favourable circumstances, the cost of making iron\nin wages alone amounts to 36s. a-ton.[7]\n\nAn immense additional value was given to all land in which the Black\nBand was found.  Mr. Mushet mentions that in 1839 the proprietor of the\nAirdrie estate derived a royalty of 16,500L. from the mineral, which\nhad not before its discovery yielded him one farthing.  At the same\ntime, many fortunes have been made by pushing and energetic men who\nhave of late years entered upon this new branch of industry.  Amongst\nthese may be mentioned the Bairds of Gartsherrie, who vie with the\nGuests and Crawshays of South Wales, and have advanced themselves in\nthe course of a very few years from the station of small farmers to\nthat of great capitalists owning estates in many counties, holding the\nhighest character commercial men, and ranking among the largest\nemployers of labour in the kingdom.\n\n\n\n[1] Article by Dugald Bannatyne in Glasgow Mechanic's Magazine, No. 53,\nDec. 1824.\n\n[2] Glasgow Mechanic's Magazine, vol. iii. p. 159.\n\n[3] Mr. Mushet described it as \"a wonderful discovery,\" and one of the\n\"most novel and beautiful improvements in his time.\"  Professor Gregory\nof Aberdeen characterized it as \"the greatest improvement with which he\nwas acquainted.\"  Mr. Jessop, an extensive English iron manufacturer,\ndeclared it to be \"of as great advantage in the iron trade as\nArkwright's machinery was in the cotton-spinning trade\"; and Mr.\nFairbairn, in his contribution on \"Iron\" in the Encyclopaedia\nBritannica, says that it \"has effected an entire revolution in the iron\nindustry of Great Britain, and forms the last era in the history of\nthis material.\"\n\n[4] The invention of the tubular air-vessels and the water-tuyere\nbelongs, we believe, to Mr. John Condie, sometime manager of the Blair\nIron Works.\n\n[5] Mr. Mushet says, \"The greatest produce in iron per furnace with the\nBlack Band and cold blast never exceeded 60 tons a-week.  The produce\nper furnace now averages 90 tons a-week.  Ten tons of this I attribute\nto the use of raw pit-coal, and the other twenty tons to the use of hot\nblast.\"  [Papers on Iron and Steel, 127.] The produce per furnace is\nnow 200 tons a-week and upwards.  The hot blast process was afterwards\napplied to the making of iron with the anthracite or stone coal of\nWales; for which a patent was taken out by George Crane in 1836.\nBefore the hot blast was introduced, anthracite coal would not act as\nfuel in the blast-furnace.  When put in, it merely had the effect of\nputting the fire out.  With the aid of the hot blast, however, it now\nproves to be a most valuable fuel in smelting.\n\n[6] It is stated in the North British Review for Nov. 1845, that \"As in\nScotland every furnace--with the exception of one at Carron--now uses\nthe hot blast the saving on our present produce of 400,000 tons of\npig-iron is 2,000,000 tons of coals, 200,000 tons of limestone, and\n#650,000 sterling per annum.\"  But as the Scotch produce is now above a\nmillion tons of pig-iron a year, the above figures will have to be\nmultiplied by 2 1/2 to give the present annual savings.\n\n[7] Papers read by Mr. Ralph Moore, Mining Engineer, Glasgow, before\nthe Royal Scottish Society of Arts, Edin. 1861, pp. 13, 14.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nMECHANICAL INVENTIONS AND INVENTORS.\n\n\"L'invention nest-elle pas la poesie de la science? . . .  Toutes les\ngrandes decouvertes portent avec elles la trace ineffacable d'une\npensee poetique.  Il faut etre poete pour creer.  Aussi, sommes-nous\nconvaincus que si les puissantes machines, veritable source de la\nproduction et de l'industrie de nos jours, doivent recevoir des\nmodifications radicales, ce sera a des hommes d'imagination, et non\npoint a dea hommes purement speciaux, que l'on devra cette\ntransformation.\"--E. M. BATAILLE, Traite des Machines a Vapeur.\n\n\nTools have played a highly important part in the history of\ncivilization.  Without tools and the ability to use them, man were\nindeed but a \"poor, bare, forked animal,\"--worse clothed than the\nbirds, worse housed than the beaver, worse fed than the jackal.  \"Weak\nin himself,\" says Carlyle, \"and of small stature, he stands on a basis,\nat most for the flattest-soled, of some half square foot, insecurely\nenough; has to straddle out his legs, Jest the very wind supplant him.\nFeeblest of bipeds!  Three quintals are a crushing load for him; the\nsteer of the meadow tosses him aloft like a waste rag.  Nevertheless he\ncan use tools, can devise tools:  with these the granite mountain melts\ninto light dust before him; he kneads glowing iron as if it were soft\npaste; seas are his smooth highway, winds and fire his unvarying\nsteeds.  Nowhere do you find him without tools: without tools he is\nnothing; with tools he is all.\"  His very first contrivances to support\nlife were tools of the simplest and rudest construction; and his latest\nachievements in the substitution of machinery for the relief of the\nhuman hand and intellect are founded on the use of tools of a still\nhigher order.  Hence it is not without good reason that man has by some\nphilosophers been defined as A TOOL-MAKING ANIMAL.\n\nTools, like everything else, had small beginnings.  With the primitive\nstone-hammer and chisel very little could be done.  The felling of a\ntree would occupy a workman a month, unless helped by the destructive\naction of fire.  Dwellings could not be built, the soil could not be\ntilled, clothes could not be fashioned and made, and the hewing out of\na boat was so tedious a process that the wood must have been far gone\nin decay before it could be launched.  It was a great step in advance\nto discover the art of working in metals, more especially in steel, one\nof the few metals capable of taking a sharp edge and keeping it.  From\nthe date of this discovery, working in wood and stone would be found\ncomparatively easy; and the results must speedily have been felt not\nonly in the improvement of man's daily food, but in his domestic and\nsocial condition.  Clothing could then be made, the primitive forest\ncould be cleared and tillage carried on; abundant fuel could be\nobtained, dwellings erected, ships built, temples reared; every\nimprovement in tools marking a new step in the development of the human\nintellect, and a further stage in the progress of human civilization.\n\nThe earliest tools were of the simplest possible character, consisting\nprincipally of modifications of the wedge; such as the knife, the\nshears (formed of two knives working on a joint), the chisel, and the\naxe.  These, with the primitive hammer, formed the principal\nstock-in-trade of the early mechanics, who were handicraftsmen in the\nliteral sense of the word.  But the work which the early craftsmen in\nwood, stone, brass, and iron, contrived to execute, sufficed to show\nhow much expertness in the handling of tools will serve to compensate\nfor their mechanical imperfections.  Workmen then sought rather to aid\nmuscular strength than to supersede it, and mainly to facilitate the\nefforts of manual skill.  Another tool became added to those mentioned\nabove, which proved an additional source of power to the workman.  We\nmean the Saw, which was considered of so much importance that its\ninventor was honoured with a place among the gods in the mythology of\nthe Greeks.  This invention is said to have been suggested by the\narrangement of the teeth in the jaw of a serpent, used by Talus the\nnephew of Daedalus in dividing a piece of wood.  From the\nrepresentations of ancient tools found in the paintings at Herculaneum\nit appears that the frame-saw used by the ancients very nearly\nresembled that still in use; and we are informed that the tools\nemployed in the carpenters' shops at Nazareth at this day are in most\nrespects the same as those represented in the buried Roman city.\nAnother very ancient tool referred to in the Bible and in Homer was the\nFile, which was used to sharpen weapons and implements.  Thus the\nHebrews \"had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the\nforks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.\" [1]  When to these\nwe add the adze, plane-irons, the anger, and the chisel, we sum up the\ntools principally relied on by the early mechanics for working in wood\nand iron.\n\nSuch continued to be the chief tools in use down almost to our own day.\nThe smith was at first the principal tool-maker; but special branches\nof trade were gradually established, devoted to tool-making.  So long,\nhowever, as the workman relied mainly on his dexterity of hand, the\namount of production was comparatively limited; for the number of\nskilled workmen was but small.  The articles turned out by them, being\nthe product of tedious manual labour, were too dear to come into common\nuse, and were made almost exclusively for the richer classes of the\ncommunity.  It was not until machinery had been invented and become\ngenerally adopted that many of the ordinary articles of necessity and\nof comfort were produced in sufficient abundance and at such prices as\nenabled them to enter into the consumption of the great body of the\npeople.\n\nBut every improver of tools had a long and difficult battle to fight;\nfor any improvement in their effective power was sure to touch the\ninterests of some established craft.  Especially was this the case with\nmachines, which are but tools of a more complete though complicated\nkind than those above described.\n\nTake, for instance, the case of the Saw.  The tedious drudgery of\ndividing timber by the old fashioned hand-saw is well known.  To avoid\nit, some ingenious person suggested that a number of saws should be\nfixed to a frame in a mill, so contrived as to work with a\nreciprocating motion, upwards and downwards, or backwards and forwards,\nand that this frame so mounted should be yoked to the mill wheel, and\nthe saws driven by the power of wind or water.  The plan was tried,\nand, as may readily be imagined, the amount of effective work done by\nthis machine-saw was immense, compared with the tedious process of\nsawing by hand.\n\nIt will be observed, however, that the new method must have seriously\ninterfered with the labour of the hand-sawyers; and it was but natural\nthat they should regard the establishment of the saw-mills with\nsuspicion and hostility.  Hence a long period elapsed before the\nhand-sawyers would permit the new machinery to be set up and worked.\nThe first saw-mill in England was erected by a Dutchman, near London,\nin 1663, but was shortly abandoned in consequence of the determined\nhostility of the workmen.  More than a century passed before a second\nsaw-mill was set up; when, in 1767, Mr. John Houghton, a London\ntimber-merchant, by the desire and with the approbation of the Society\nof Arts, erected one at Limehouse, to be driven by wind.  The work was\ndirected by one James Stansfield, who had gone over to Holland for the\npurpose of learning the art of constructing and managing the sawing\nmachinery.  But the mill was no sooner erected than a mob assembled and\nrazed it to the ground.  The principal rioters having been punished,\nand the loss to the proprietor having been made good by the nation, a\nnew mill was shortly after built, and it was suffered to work without\nfurther molestation.\n\nImproved methods of manufacture have usually had to encounter the same\nkind of opposition.  Thus, when the Flemish weavers came over to\nEngland in the seventeenth century, bringing with them their skill and\ntheir industry, they excited great jealousy and hostility amongst the\nnative workmen.  Their competition as workmen was resented as an\ninjury, but their improved machinery was regarded as a far greater\nsource of mischief.  In a memorial presented to the king in 1621 we\nfind the London weavers complaining of the foreigners' competition, but\nespecially that \"they have made so bould of late as to devise engines\nfor working of tape, lace, ribbin, and such like, wherein one man doth\nmore among them than 7 Englishe men can doe; so as their cheap sale of\ncommodities beggereth all our Englishe artificers of that trade, and\nenricheth them.\" [2]\n\nAt a much more recent period new inventions have had to encounter\nserious rioting and machine-breaking fury.  Kay of the fly-shuttle,\nHargreaves of the spinning-jenny, and Arkwright of the spinning-frame,\nall had to fly from Lancashire, glad to escape with their lives.\nIndeed, says Mr. Bazley, \"so jealous were the people, and also the\nlegislature, of everything calculated to supersede men's labour, that\nwhen the Sankey Canal, six miles long, near Warrington, was authorized\nabout the middle of last century, it was on the express condition that\nthe boats plying on it should be drawn by men only!\" [3]  Even improved\nagricultural tools and machines have had the same opposition to\nencounter; and in our own time bands of rural labourers have gone from\nfarm to farm breaking drill-ploughs, winnowing, threshing, and other\nmachines, down even to the common drills,--not perceiving that if their\npolicy had proved successful, and tools could have been effectually\ndestroyed, the human race would at once have been reduced to their\nteeth and nails, and civilization summarily abolished.[4]  It is, no\ndoubt, natural that the ordinary class of workmen should regard with\nprejudice, if not with hostility, the introduction of machines\ncalculated to place them at a disadvantage and to interfere with their\nusual employments; for to poor and not very far-seeing men the loss of\ndaily bread is an appalling prospect.  But invention does not stand\nstill on that account.  Human brains WILL work.  Old tools are improved\nand new ones invented, superseding existing methods of production,\nthough the weak and unskilled may occasionally be pushed aside or even\ntrodden under foot.  The consolation which remains is, that while the\nfew suffer, society as a whole is vastly benefitted by the improved\nmethods of production which are suggested, invented, and perfected by\nthe experience of successive generations.\n\nThe living race is the inheritor of the industry and skill of all past\ntimes; and the civilization we enjoy is but the sum of the useful\neffects of labour during the past centuries.  Nihil per saltum.  By\nslow and often painful steps Nature's secrets have been mastered.  Not\nan effort has been made but has had its influence.  For no human labour\nis altogether lost; some remnant of useful effect surviving for the\nbenefit of the race, if not of the individual.  Even attempts\napparently useless have not really been so, but have served in some way\nto advance man to higher knowledge, skill, or discipline.  \"The loss of\na position gained,\" says Professor Thomson, \"is an event unknown in the\nhistory of man's struggle with the forces of inanimate nature.\"  A\nsingle step won gives a firmer foothold for further effort.  The man\nmay die, but the race survives and continues the work,--to use the\npoet's simile, mounting on stepping-stones of dead selves to higher\nselves.\n\nPhilarete Chasles, indeed, holds that it is the Human Race that is your\ntrue inventor:  \"As if to unite all generations,\" he says, \"and to show\nthat man can only act efficiently by association with others, it has\nbeen ordained that each inventor shall only interpret the first word of\nthe problem he sets himself to solve, and that every great idea shall\nbe the RESUME of the past at the same time that it is the germ of the\nfuture.\"  And rarely does it happen that any discovery or invention of\nimportance is made by one man alone.  The threads of inquiry are taken\nup and traced, one labourer succeeding another, each tracing it a\nlittle further, often without apparent result.  This goes on sometimes\nfor centuries, until at length some man, greater perhaps than his\nfellows, seeking to fulfil the needs of his time, gathers the various\nthreads together, treasures up the gain of past successes and failures,\nand uses them as the means for some solid achievement, Thus Newton\ndiscovered the law of gravitation, and thus James Watt invented the\nsteam-engine.  So also of the Locomotive, of which Robert Stephenson\nsaid, \"It has not been the invention of any one man, but of a race of\nmechanical engineers.\"  Or, as Joseph Bramah observed, in the preamble\nto his second Lock patent, \"Among the number of patents granted there\nare comparatively few which can be called original so that it is\ndifficult to say where the boundary of one ends and where that of\nanother begins.\"\n\nThe arts are indeed reared but slowly; and it was a wise observation of\nLord Bacon that we are too apt to pass those ladders by which they have\nbeen reared, and reflect the whole merit on the last new performer.\nThus, what is hailed as an original invention is often found to be but\nthe result of a long succession of trials and experiments gradually\nfollowing each other, which ought rather to be considered as a\ncontinuous series of achievements of the human mind than as the\nconquest of any single individual.  It has sometimes taken centuries of\nexperience to ascertain the value of a single fact in its various\nbearings.  Like man himself, experience is feeble and apparently\npurposeless in its infancy, but acquires maturity and strength with\nage.  Experience, however, is not limited to a lifetime, but is the\nstored-up wealth and power of our race.  Even amidst the death of\nsuccessive generations it is constantly advancing and accumulating,\nexhibiting at the same time the weakness and the power, the littleness\nand the greatness of our common humanity.  And not only do we who live\nsucceed to the actual results of our predecessors' labours,--to their\nworks of learning and of art, their inventions and discoveries, their\ntools and machines, their roads, bridges, canals, and railways,--but to\nthe inborn aptitudes of blood and brain which they bequeath to us, to\nthat \"educability,\" so to speak, which has been won for us by the\nlabours of many generations, and forms our richest natural heritage.\n\nThe beginning of most inventions is very remote.  The first idea, born\nwithin some unknown brain, passes thence into others, and at last comes\nforth complete, after a parturition, it may be, of centuries.  One\nstarts the idea, another developes it, and so on progressively until at\nlast it is elaborated and worked out in practice; but the first not\nless than the last is entitled to his share in the merit of the\ninvention, were it only possible to measure and apportion it duly.\nSometimes a great original mind strikes upon some new vein of hidden\npower, and gives a powerful impulse to the inventive faculties of man,\nwhich lasts through generations.  More frequently, however, inventions\nare not entirely new, but modifications of contrivances previously\nknown, though to a few, and not yet brought into practical use.\nGlancing back over the history of mechanism, we occasionally see an\ninvention seemingly full born, when suddenly it drops out of sight, and\nwe hear no more of it for centuries.  It is taken up de novo by some\ninventor, stimulated by the needs of his time, and falling again upon\nthe track, he recovers the old footmarks, follows them up, and\ncompletes the work.\n\nThere is also such a thing as inventions being born before their\ntime--the advanced mind of one generation projecting that which cannot\nbe executed for want of the requisite means; but in due process of\ntime, when mechanism has got abreast of the original idea, it is at\nlength carried out; and thus it is that modern inventors are enabled to\neffect many objects which their predecessors had tried in vain to\naccomplish.  As Louis Napoleon has said, \"Inventions born before their\ntime must remain useless until the level of common intellects rises to\ncomprehend them.\"  For this reason, misfortune is often the lot of the\ninventor before his time, though glory and profit may belong to his\nsuccessors.  Hence the gift of inventing not unfrequently involves a\nyoke of sorrow.  Many of the greatest inventors have lived neglected\nand died unrequited, before their merits could be recognised and\nestimated.  Even if they succeed, they often raise up hosts of enemies\nin the persons whose methods they propose to supersede.  Envy, malice,\nand detraction meet them in all their forms; they are assailed by\ncombinations of rich and unscrupulous persons to wrest from them the\nprofits of their ingenuity; and last and worst of all, the successful\ninventor often finds his claims to originality decried, and himself\nbranded as a copyist and a pirate.\n\nAmong the inventions born out of time, and before the world could make\nadequate use of them, we can only find space to allude to a few, though\nthey are so many that one is almost disposed to accept the words of\nChaucer as true, that \"There is nothing new but what has once been\nold;\" or, as another writer puts it, \"There is nothing new but what has\nbefore been known and forgotten;\" or, in the words of Solomon, \"The\nthing that hath been is that which shall be, and there is no new thing\nunder the sun.\"  One of the most important of these is the use of\nSteam, which was well known to the ancients; but though it was used to\ngrind drugs, to turn a spit, and to excite the wonder and fear of the\ncredulous, a long time elapsed before it became employed as a useful\nmotive-power.  The inquiries and experiments on the subject extended\nthrough many ages.  Friar Bacon, who flourished in the thirteenth\ncentury, seems fully to have anticipated, in the following remarkable\npassage, nearly all that steam could accomplish, as well as the\nhydraulic engine and the diving-bell, though the flying machine yet\nremains to be invented:--\n\n\"I will now,\" says the Friar, \"mention some of the wonderful works of\nart and nature in which there is nothing of magic, and which magic\ncould not perform.  Instruments may be made by which the largest ships,\nwith only one man guiding them, will be carried with greater velocity\nthan if they were full of sailors.  Chariots may be constructed that\nwill move with incredible rapidity, without the help of animals.\nInstruments of flying may be formed, in which a man, sitting at his\nease and meditating on any subject, may beat the air with his\nartificial wings, after the manner of birds.  A small instrument may be\nmade to raise or depress the greatest weights.  An instrument may be\nfabricated by which one man may draw a thousand men to him by force and\nagainst their will; as also machines which will enable men to walk at\nthe bottom of seas or rivers without danger.\" It is possible that Friar\nBacon derived his knowledge of the powers which he thus described from\nthe traditions handed down of former inventions which had been\nneglected and allowed to fall into oblivion; for before the invention\nof printing, which enabled the results of investigation and experience\nto be treasured up in books, there was great risk of the inventions of\none age being lost to the succeeding generations.  Yet Disraeli the\nelder is of opinion that the Romans had invented printing without being\naware of it; or perhaps the senate dreaded the inconveniences attending\nits use, and did not care to deprive a large body of scribes of their\nemployment.  They even used stereotypes, or immovable printing-types,\nto stamp impressions on their pottery, specimens of which still exist.\nIn China the art of printing is of great antiquity.  Lithography was\nwell known in Germany, by the very name which it still bears, nearly\nthree hundred years before Senefelder reinvented it; and specimens of\nthe ancient art are yet to be seen in the Royal Museum at Munich.[5]\n\nSteam-locomotion by sea and land, had long been dreamt of and\nattempted.  Blasco de Garay made his experiment in the harbour of\nBarcelona as early as 1543; Denis Papin made a similar attempt at\nCassel in 1707; but it was not until Watt had solved the problem of the\nsteam-engine that the idea of the steam-boat could be developed in\npractice, which was done by Miller of Dalswinton in 1788.  Sages and\npoets have frequently foreshadowed inventions of great social moment.\nThus Dr. Darwin's anticipation of the locomotive, in his Botanic\nGarden, published in 1791, before any locomotive had been invented,\nmight almost be regarded as prophetic:\n\n      Soon shall thy arm, unconquered Steam! afar\n      Drag the slow barge, and drive the rapid car.\n\nDenis Papin first threw out the idea of atmospheric locomotion; and\nGauthey, another Frenchman, in 1782 projected a method of conveying\nparcels and merchandise by subterraneous tubes,[6] after the method\nrecently patented and brought into operation by the London Pneumatic\nDespatch Company.  The balloon was an ancient Italian invention,\nrevived by Mongolfier long after the original had been forgotten.  Even\nthe reaping machine is an old invention revived.  Thus Barnabe Googe,\nthe translator of a book from the German entitled 'The whole Arte and\nTrade of Husbandrie,' published in 1577, in the reign of Elizabeth,\nspeaks of the reaping-machine as a worn-out invention--a thing \"which\nwas woont to be used in France.  The device was a lowe kinde of carre\nwith a couple of wheeles, and the frunt armed with sharpe syckles,\nwhiche, forced by the beaste through the corne, did cut down al before\nit.  This tricke,\" says Googe, \"might be used in levell and champion\ncountreys; but with us it wolde make but ill-favoured woorke.\" [7]  The\nThames Tunnel was thought an entirely new manifestation of engineering\ngenius; but the tunnel under the Euphrates at ancient Babylon, and that\nunder the wide mouth of the harbour at Marseilles (a much more\ndifficult work), show that the ancients were beforehand with us in the\nart of tunnelling.  Macadamized roads are as old as the Roman empire;\nand suspension bridges, though comparatively new in Europe, have been\nknown in China for centuries.\n\nThere is every reason to believe--indeed it seems clear that the Romans\nknew of gunpowder, though they only used it for purposes of fireworks;\nwhile the secret of the destructive Greek fire has been lost\naltogether.  When gunpowder came to be used for purposes of war,\ninvention busied itself upon instruments of destruction.  When recently\nexamining the Museum of the Arsenal at Venice, we were surprised to\nfind numerous weapons of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\nembodying the most recent English improvements in arms, such as\nrevolving pistols, rifled muskets, and breech-loading cannon.  The\nlatter, embodying Sir William Armstrong's modern idea, though in a rude\nform, had been fished up from the bottom of the Adriatic, where the\nship armed with them had been sunk hundreds of years ago.  Even\nPerkins's steam-gun was an old invention revived by Leonardo da Vinci\nand by him attributed to Archimedes.[8]  The Congreve rocket is said to\nhave an Eastern origin, Sir William Congreve having observed its\ndestructive effects when employed by the forces under Tippoo Saib in\nthe Mahratta war, on which he adopted and improved the missile, and\nbrought out the invention as his own.\n\nCoal-gas was regularly used by the Chinese for lighting purposes long\nbefore it was known amongst us.  Hydropathy was generally practised by\nthe Romans, who established baths wherever they went.  Even chloroform\nis no new thing.  The use of ether as an anaesthetic was known to\nAlbertus Magnus, who flourished in the thirteenth century; and in his\nworks he gives a recipe for its preparation.  In 1681 Denis Papin\npublished his Traite des Operations sans Douleur, showing that he had\ndiscovered methods of deadening pain.  But the use of anaesthetics is\nmuch older than Albertus Magnus or Papin; for the ancients had their\nnepenthe and mandragora; the Chinese their mayo, and the Egyptians\ntheir hachisch (both preparations of Cannabis Indica), the effects of\nwhich in a great measure resemble those of chloroform.  What is perhaps\nstill more surprising is the circumstance that one of the most elegant\nof recent inventions, that of sun-painting by the daguerreotype, was in\nthe fifteenth century known to Leonardo da Vinci,[9] whose skill as an\narchitect and engraver, and whose accomplishments as a chemist and\nnatural philosopher, have been almost entirely overshadowed by his\ngenius as a painter.[10]  The idea, thus early born, lay in oblivion\nuntil 1760, when the daguerreotype was again clearly indicated in a\nbook published in Paris, written by a certain Tiphanie de la Roche,\nunder the anagrammatic title of Giphantie.  Still later, at the\nbeginning of the present century, we find Thomas Wedgwood, Sir Humphry\nDavy, and James Watt, making experiments on the action of light upon\nnitrate of silver; and only within the last few months a silvered\ncopper-plate has been found amongst the old household lumber of Matthew\nBoulton (Watt's partner), having on it a representation of the old\npremises at Soho, apparently taken by some such process.[11]\n\nIn like manner the invention of the electric telegraph, supposed to be\nexclusively modern, was clearly indicated by Schwenter in his\nDelasements Physico-Mathematiques, published in 1636; and he there\npointed out how two individuals could communicate with each other by\nmeans of the magnetic needle.  A century later, in 1746, Le Monnier\nexhibited a series of experiments in the Royal Gardens at Paris,\nshowing how electricity could be transmitted through iron wire 950\nfathoms in length; and in 1753 we find one Charles Marshall publishing\na remarkable description of the electric telegraph in the Scots\nMagazine, under the title of 'An expeditions Method of conveying\nIntelligence.' Again, in 1760, we find George Louis Lesage, professor\nof mathematics at Geneva, promulgating his invention of an electric\ntelegraph, which he eventually completed and set to work in 1774.  This\ninstrument was composed of twenty-four metallic wires, separate from\neach other and enclosed in a non-conducting substance.  Each wire ended\nin a stalk mounted with a little ball of elder-wood suspended by a silk\nthread.  When a stream of electricity, no matter how slight., was sent\nthrough the wire, the elder-ball at the opposite end was repelled, such\nmovement designating some letter of the alphabet.  A few years later we\nfind Arthur Young, in his Travels in France, describing a similar\nmachine invented by a M. Lomond of Paris, the action of which he also\ndescribes.[12]  In these and similar cases, though the idea was born\nand the model of the invention was actually made, it still waited the\nadvent of the scientific mechanical inventor who should bring it to\nperfection, and embody it in a practical working form.\n\nSome of the most valuable inventions have descended to us without the\nnames of their authors having been preserved.  We are the inheritors of\nan immense legacy of the results of labour and ingenuity, but we know\nnot the names of our benefactors.  Who invented the watch as a measurer\nof time? Who invented the fast and loose pulley? Who invented the\neccentric? Who, asks a mechanical inquirer,[13] \"invented the method of\ncutting screws with stocks and dies? Whoever he might be, he was\ncertainly a great benefactor of his species.  Yet (adds the writer) his\nname is not known, though the invention has been so recent.\"  This is\nnot, however, the case with most modern inventions, the greater number\nof which are more or less disputed.  Who was entitled to the merit of\ninventing printing has never yet been determined.  Weber and Senefelder\nboth laid claim to the invention of lithography, though it was merely\nan old German art revived.  Even the invention of the penny-postage\nsystem by Sir Rowland Hill is disputed; Dr. Gray of the British Museum\nclaiming to be its inventor, and a French writer alleging it to be an\nold French invention.[14]  The invention of the steamboat has been\nclaimed on behalf of Blasco de Garay, a Spaniard, Papin, a Frenchman,\nJonathan Hulls, an Englishman, and Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, a\nScotchman.  The invention of the spinning machine has been variously\nattributed to Paul, Wyatt, Hargreaves, Higley, and Arkwright.  The\ninvention of the balance-spring was claimed by Huyghens, a Dutchman,\nHautefeuille, a Frenchman, and Hooke, an Englishman.  There is scarcely\na point of detail in the locomotive but is the subject of dispute.\nThus the invention of the blast-pipe is claimed for Trevithick, George\nStephenson, Goldsworthy Gurney, and Timothy Hackworth; that of the\ntubular boiler by Seguin, Stevens, Booth, and W.  H.  James; that of\nthe link-motion by John Gray, Hugh Williams, and Robert Stephenson.\n\nIndeed many inventions appear to be coincident.  A number of minds are\nworking at the same time in the same track, with the object of\nsupplying some want generally felt; and, guided by the same experience,\nthey not unfrequently arrive at like results.  It has sometimes\nhappened that the inventors have been separated by great distances, so\nthat piracy on the part of either was impossible.  Thus Hadley and\nGodfrey almost simultaneously invented the quadrant, the one in London,\nthe other in Philadelphia; and the process of electrotyping was\ninvented at the same time by Mr. Spencer, a working chemist at\nLiverpool, and by Professor Jacobi at St.  Petersburg.  The safety-lamp\nwas a coincident invention, made about the same time by Sir Humphry\nDavy and George Stephenson; and perhaps a still more remarkable\ninstance of a coincident discovery was that of the planet Neptune by\nLeverrier at Paris, and by Adams at Cambridge.\n\nIt is always difficult to apportion the due share of merit which\nbelongs to mechanical inventors, who are accustomed to work upon each\nother's hints and suggestions, as well as by their own experience.\nSome idea of this difficulty may be formed from the fact that, in the\ncourse of our investigations as to the origin of the planing\nmachine--one of the most useful of modern tools--we have found that it\nhas been claimed on behalf of six inventors--Fox of Derby, Roberts of\nManchester, Matthew Murray of Leeds, Spring of Aberdeen, Clement and\nGeorge Rennie of London; and there may be other claimants of whom we\nhave not yet heard.  But most mechanical inventions are of a very\ncomposite character, and are led up to by the labour and the study of a\nlong succession of workers.  Thus Savary and Newcomen led up to Watt;\nCugnot, Murdock, and Trevithick to the Stephensons; and Maudslay to\nClement, Roberts, Nasmyth, Whitworth, and many more mechanical\ninventors.  There is scarcely a process in the arts but has in like\nmanner engaged mind after mind in bringing it to perfection.  \"There is\nnothing,\" says Mr. Hawkshaw, \"really worth having that man has\nobtained, that has not been the result of a combined and gradual\nprocess of investigation.  A gifted individual comes across some old\nfootmark, stumbles on a chain of previous research and inquiry.  He\nmeets, for instance, with a machine, the result of much previous\nlabour; he modifies it, pulls it to pieces, constructs and reconstructs\nit, and by further trial and experiment he arrives at the long\nsought-for result.\" [15]\n\nBut the making of the invention is not the sole difficulty.  It is one\nthing to invent, said Sir Marc Brunel, and another thing to make the\ninvention work.  Thus when Watt, after long labour and study, had\nbrought his invention to completion, he encountered an obstacle which\nhas stood in the way of other inventors, and for a time prevented the\nintroduction of their improvements, if not led to their being laid\naside and abandoned.  This was the circumstance that the machine\nprojected was so much in advance of the mechanical capability of the\nage that it was with the greatest difficulty it could be executed.\nWhen labouring upon his invention at Glasgow, Watt was baffled and\nthrown into despair by the clumsiness and incompetency of his workmen.\nWriting to Dr. Roebuck on one occasion, he said, \"You ask what is the\nprincipal hindrance in erecting engines? It is always the smith-work.\"\nHis first cylinder was made by a whitesmith, of hammered iron soldered\ntogether, but having used quicksilver to keep the cylinder air-tight,\nit dropped through the inequalities into the interior, and \"played the\ndevil with the solder.\"  Yet, inefficient though the whitesmith was,\nWatt could ill spare him, and we find him writing to Dr. Roebuck almost\nin despair, saying, \"My old white-iron man is dead!\" feeling his loss\nto be almost irreparable.  His next cylinder was cast and bored at\nCarron, but it was so untrue that it proved next to useless.  The\npiston could not be kept steam tight, notwithstanding the various\nexpedients which were adopted of stuffing it with paper, cork, putty,\npasteboard, and old hat.  Even after Watt had removed to Birmingham,\nand he had the assistance of Boulton's best workmen, Smeaton expressed\nthe opinion, when he saw the engine at work, that notwithstanding the\nexcellence of the invention, it could never be brought into general use\nbecause of the difficulty of getting its various parts manufactured\nwith sufficient precision.  For a long time we find Watt, in his\nletters, complaining to his partner of the failure of his engines\nthrough \"villainous bad workmanship.\" Sometimes the cylinders, when\ncast, were found to be more than an eighth of an inch wider at one end\nthan the other; and under such circumstances it was impossible the\nengine could act with precision.  Yet better work could not be had.\nFirst-rate workmen in machinery did not as yet exist; they were only in\nprocess of education.  Nearly everything had to be done by hand.  The\ntools used were of a very imperfect kind.  A few ill-constructed\nlathes, with some drills and boring-machines of a rude sort,\nconstituted the principal furniture of the workshop.  Years after, when\nBrunel invented his block-machines, considerable time elapsed before he\ncould find competent mechanics to construct them, and even after they\nhad been constructed he had equal difficulty in finding competent hands\nto work them.[16]\n\nWatt endeavoured to remedy the defect by keeping certain sets of\nworkmen to special classes of work, allowing them to do nothing else.\nFathers were induced to bring up their sons at the same bench with\nthemselves, and initiate them in the dexterity which they had acquired\nby experience; and at Soho it was not unusual for the same precise line\nof work to be followed by members of the same family for three\ngenerations.  In this way as great a degree of accuracy of a mechanical\nkind was arrived at was practicable under the circumstances.  But\nnotwithstanding all this care, accuracy of fitting could not be secured\nso long as the manufacture of steam-engines was conducted mainly by\nhand.  There was usually a considerable waste of steam, which the\nexpedients of chewed paper and greased hat packed outside the piston\nwere insufficient to remedy; and it was not until the invention of\nautomatic machine-tools by the mechanical engineers about to be\nmentioned, that the manufacture of the steam-engine became a matter of\ncomparative ease and certainty.  Watt was compelled to rest satisfied\nwith imperfect results, arising from imperfect workmanship.  Thus,\nwriting to Dr. Small respecting a cylinder 18 inches in diameter, he\nsaid, \"at the worst place the long diameter exceeded the short by only\nthree-eighths of an inch.\"  How different from the state of things at\nthis day, when a cylinder five feet wide will be rejected as a piece of\nimperfect workmanship if it be found to vary in any part more than the\n80th part of an inch in diameter!\n\nNot fifty years since it was a matter of the utmost difficulty to set\nan engine to work, and sometimes of equal difficulty to keep it going.\nThough fitted by competent workmen, it often would not go at all.  Then\nthe foreman of the factory at which it was made was sent for, and he\nwould almost live beside the engine for a month or more; and after\neasing her here and screwing her up there, putting in a new part and\naltering an old one, packing the piston and tightening the valves, the\nmachine would at length begot to work.[17]  Now the case is altogether\ndifferent.  The perfection of modern machine-tools is such that the\nutmost possible precision is secured, and the mechanical engineer can\ncalculate on a degree of exactitude that does not admit of a deviation\nbeyond the thousandth part of an inch.  When the powerful oscillating\nengines of the 'Warrior' were put on board that ship, the parts,\nconsisting of some five thousand separate pieces, were brought from the\ndifferent workshops of the Messrs. Penn and Sons, where they had been\nmade by workmen who knew not the places they were to occupy, and fitted\ntogether with such precision that so soon as the steam was raised and\nlet into the cylinders, the immense machine began as if to breathe and\nmove like a living creature, stretching its huge arms like a new-born\ngiant, and then, after practising its strength a little and proving its\nsoundness in body and limb, it started off with the power of above a\nthousand horses to try its strength in breasting the billows of the\nNorth Sea.\n\nSuch are among the triumphs of modern mechanical engineering, due in a\ngreat measure to the perfection of the tools by means of which all\nworks in metal are now fashioned.  These tools are themselves among the\nmost striking results of the mechanical invention of the day.  They are\nautomata of the most perfect kind, rendering the engine and\nmachine-maker in a great measure independent of inferior workmen.  For\nthe machine tools have no unsteady hand, are not careless nor clumsy,\ndo not work by rule of thumb, and cannot make mistakes.  They will\nrepeat their operations a thousand times without tiring, or varying one\nhair's breadth in their action; and will turn out, without complaining,\nany quantity of work, all of like accuracy and finish.  Exercising as\nthey do so remarkable an influence on the development of modern\nindustry, we now propose, so far as the materials at our disposal will\nadmit, to give an account of their principal inventors, beginning with\nthe school of Bramah.\n\n\n\n[1] 1 Samuel, ch. xiii. v. 21.\n\n[2] State Papers, Dom. 1621, Vol. 88, No. 112.\n\n[3] Lectures on the Results of the Great Exhibition of 1851, 2nd\nSeries, 117.\n\n[4] Dr. Kirwan, late President of the Royal Irish Academy, who had\ntravelled much on the continent of Europe, used to relate, when\nspeaking of the difficulty of introducing improvements in the arts and\nmanufactures, and of the prejudices entertained for old practices,\nthat, in Normandy, the farmers had been so long accustomed to the use\nof plough's whose shares were made entirely of WOOD that they could not\nbe prevailed on to make trial of those with IRON; that they considered\nthem to be an idle and useless innovation on the long-established\npractices of their ancestors; and that they carried these prejudices so\nfar as to force the government to issue an edict on the subject.

The saying that the\npoet is born, not made, applies with equal force to the inventor, who,\nthough indebted like the other to culture and improved opportunities,\nnevertheless invents and goes on inventing mainly to gratify his own\ninstinct.  The inventor, however, is not a creator like the poet, but\nchiefly a finder-out.  His power consists in a great measure in quick\nperception and accurate observation, and in seeing and foreseeing the\neffects of certain mechanical combinations.  He must possess the gift\nof insight, as well as of manual dexterity, combined with the\nindispensable qualities of patience and perseverance,--for though\nbaffled, as he often is, he must be ready to rise up again unconquered\neven in the moment of defeat.  This is the stuff of which the greatest\ninventors have been made.  The subject of the following memoir may not\nbe entitled to take rank as a first-class inventor, though he was a\nmost prolific one; but, as the founder of a school from which proceeded\nsome of the most distinguished mechanics of our time, he is entitled to\na prominent place in this series of memoirs.\n\nJoseph Bramah was born in 1748 at the village of Stainborough, near\nBarnsley in Yorkshire, where his father rented a small farm under Lord\nStrafford.  Joseph was the eldest of five children, and was early\ndestined to follow the plough.  After receiving a small amount of\neducation at the village school, he was set to work upon the farm.\nFrom an early period he showed signs of constructive skill.  When a\nmere boy, he occupied his leisure hours in making musical instruments,\nand he succeeded in executing some creditable pieces of work with very\nimperfect tools.  A violin, which he made out of a solid block of wood,\nwas long preserved as a curiosity.  He was so fortunate as to make a\nfriend of the village blacksmith, whose smithy he was in the practice\nof frequenting.  The smith was an ingenious workman, and, having taken\na liking for the boy, he made sundry tools for him out of old files and\nrazor blades; and with these his fiddle and other pieces of work were\nmainly executed.\n\nJoseph might have remained a ploughman for life, but for an accident\nwhich happened to his right ankle at the age of 16, which unfitted him\nfor farm-work.  While confined at home disabled he spent his time in\ncarving and making things in wood; and then it occurred to him that,\nthough he could not now be a ploughman, he might be a mechanic.  When\nsufficiently recovered, he was accordingly put apprentice to one\nAllott, the village carpenter, under whom he soon became an expert\nworkman.  He could make ploughs, window-frames, or fiddles, with equal\ndexterity.  He also made violoncellos, and was so fortunate as to sell\none of his making for three guineas, which is still reckoned a good\ninstrument.  He doubtless felt within him the promptings of ambition,\nsuch as every good workman feels, and at all events entertained the\ndesire of rising in his trade.  When his time was out, he accordingly\nresolved to seek work in London, whither he made the journey on foot.\nHe soon found work at a cabinet-maker's, and remained with him for some\ntime, after which he set up business in a very small way on his own\naccount.  An accident which happened to him in the course of his daily\nwork, again proved his helper, by affording him a degree of leisure\nwhich he at once proceeded to turn to some useful account.  Part of his\nbusiness consisted in putting up water-closets, after a method invented\nor improved by a Mr. Allen; but the article was still very imperfect;\nand Bramah had long resolved that if he could only secure some leisure\nfor the purpose, he would contrive something that should supersede it\naltogether.  A severe fall which occurred to him in the course of his\nbusiness, and laid him up, though very much against his will, now\nafforded him the leisure which he desired, and he proceeded to make his\nproposed invention.  He took out a patent for it in 1778, describing\nhimself in the specification as \"of Cross Court, Carnaby Market [Golden\nSquare], Middlesex, Cabinet Maker.\"  He afterwards removed to a shop in\nDenmark Street, St.  Giles's, and while there he made a further\nimprovement in his invention by the addition of a water cock, which he\npatented in 1783.  The merits of the machine were generally recognised,\nand before long it came into extensive use, continuing to be employed,\nwith but few alterations, until the present day.  His circumstances\nimproving with the increased use of his invention, Bramah proceeded to\nundertake the manufacture of the pumps, pipes, &c., required for its\nconstruction; and, remembering his friend the Yorkshire blacksmith, who\nhad made his first tools for him out of the old files and razor-blades,\nhe sent for him to London to take charge of his blacksmith's\ndepartment, in which he proved a most useful assistant.  As usual, the\npatent was attacked by pirates so soon as it became productive, and\nBramah was under the necessity, on more than one occasion, of defending\nhis property in the invention, in which he was completely successful.\n\nWe next find Bramah turning his attention to the invention of a lock\nthat should surpass all others then known.  The locks then in use were\nof a very imperfect character, easily picked by dexterous thieves,\nagainst whom they afforded little protection.  Yet locks are a very\nancient invention, though, as in many other cases, the art of making\nthem seems in a great measure to have become lost, and accordingly had\nto be found out anew.  Thus the tumbler lock--which consists in the use\nof moveable impediments acted on by the proper key only, as\ncontradistinguished from the ordinary ward locks, where the impediments\nare fixed--appears to have been well known to the ancient Egyptians,\nthe representation of such a lock being found sculptured among the\nbas-reliefs which decorate the great temple at Karnak.  This kind of\nlock was revived, or at least greatly improved, by a Mr. Barron in\n1774, and it was shortly after this time that Bramah directed his\nattention to the subject.  After much study and many experiments, he\ncontrived a lock more simple, more serviceable, as well as more secure,\nthan Barron's, as is proved by the fact that it has stood the test of\nnearly eighty years' experience,[1] and still holds its ground.  For a\nlong time, indeed, Bramah's lock was regarded as absolutely inviolable,\nand it remained unpicked for sixty-seven years until Hobbs the American\nmastered it in 1851.  A notice had long been exhibited in Bramah's\nshop-window in Piccadilly, offering 200L. to any one who should succeed\nin picking the patent lock.  Many tried, and all failed, until Hobbs\nsucceeded, after sixteen days' manipulation of it with various\nelaborate instruments.  But the difficulty with which the lock was\npicked showed that, for all ordinary purposes, it might be pronounced\nimpregnable.\n\nThe new locks were machines of the most delicate kind, the action of\nwhich depended in a great measure upon the precision with which the\nsprings, sliders, levers, barrels, and other parts were finished.  The\nmerits of the invention being generally admitted, there was a\nconsiderable demand for the locks, and the necessity thus arose for\ninventing a series of original machine-tools to enable them to be\nmanufactured in sufficient quantities to meet the demand.  It is\nprobable, indeed, that, but for the contrivance of such tools, the lock\ncould never have come in to general use, as the skill of hand-workmen,\nno matter how experienced, could not have been relied upon for turning\nout the article with that degree of accuracy and finish in all the\nparts which was indispensable for its proper action.  In conducting the\nmanufacture throughout, Bramah was greatly assisted by Henry Maudslay,\nhis foreman, to whom he was in no small degree indebted for the\ncontrivance of those tool-machines which enabled him to carry on the\nbusiness of lock-making with advantage and profit.\n\nBramah's indefatigable spirit of invention was only stimulated to fresh\nefforts by the success of his lock; and in the course of a few years we\nfind him entering upon a more important and original line of action\nthan he had yet ventured on.  His patent of 1785 shows the direction of\nhis studies.  Watt had invented his steam-engine, which was coming into\ngeneral use; and the creation of motive-power in various other forms\nbecame a favourite subject of inquiry with inventors.  Bramah's first\ninvention with this object was his Hydrostatic Machine, founded on the\ndoctrine of the equilibrium of pressure in fluids, as exhibited in the\nwell known 'hydrostatic paradox.' In his patent of 1785, in which he no\nlonger describes himself as Cabinet maker, but 'Engine maker' of\nPiccadilly, he indicated many inventions, though none of them came into\npractical use,--such as a Hydrostatical Machine and Boiler, and the\napplication of the power produced by them to the drawing of carriages,\nand the propelling of ships by a paddle-wheel fixed in the stern of the\nvessel, of which drawings are annexed to the specification; but it was\nnot until 1795 that he patented his Hydrostatic or Hydraulic Press.\n\nThough the principle on which the Hydraulic Press is founded had long\nbeen known, and formed the subject of much curious speculation, it\nremained unproductive of results until a comparatively recent period,\nwhen the idea occurred of applying it to mechanical purposes.  A\nmachine of the kind was indeed proposed by Pascal, the eminent\nphilosopher, in 1664, but more than a century elapsed before the\ndifficulties in the way of its construction were satisfactorily\novercome.  Bramah's machine consists of a large and massive cylinder,\nin which there works an accurately-fitted solid piston or plunger.  A\nforcing-pump of very small bore communicates with the bottom of the\ncylinder, and by the action of the pump-handle or lever, exceeding\nsmall quantities of water are forced in succession beneath the piston\nin the large cylinder, thus gradually raising it up, and compressing\nbodies whose bulk or volume it is intended to reduce.  Hence it is most\ncommonly used as a packing-press, being superior to every other\ncontrivance of the kind that has yet been invented; and though\nexercising a prodigious force, it is so easily managed that a boy can\nwork it.  The machine has been employed on many extraordinary occasions\nin preference to other methods of applying power.  Thus Robert\nStephenson used it to hoist the gigantic tubes of the Britannia Bridge\ninto their bed,[2] and Brunel to launch the Great Eastern steamship\nfrom her cradles.  It has also been used to cut bars of iron, to draw\nthe piles driven in forming coffer dams, and to wrench up trees by the\nroots, all of which feats it accomplishes with comparative ease.\n\nThe principal difficulty experienced in constructing the hydraulic\npress before the time of Bramah arose from the tremendous pressure\nexercised by the pump, which forced the water through between the solid\npiston and the side of the cylinder in which it worked in such\nquantities as to render the press useless for practical purposes.\nBramah himself was at first completely baffled by this difficulty.  It\nwill be observed that the problem was to secure a joint sufficiently\nfree to let the piston slide up through it, and at the same time so\nwater-tight as to withstand the internal force of the pump.  These two\nconditions seemed so conflicting that Bramah was almost at his wit's\nend, and for a time despaired of being able to bring the machine to a\nstate of practical efficiency.  None but those who have occupied\nthemselves in the laborious and often profitless task of helping the\nworld to new and useful machines can have any idea of the tantalizing\nanxiety which arises from the apparently petty stumbling-blocks which\nfor awhile impede the realization of a great idea in mechanical\ninvention.  Such was the case with the water-tight arrangement in the\nhydraulic press.  In his early experiments, Bramah tried the expedient\nof the ordinary stuffing-box for the purpose of securing the required\nwater tightness' That is, a coil of hemp on leather washers was placed\nin a recess, so as to fit tightly round the moving ram or piston, and\nit was further held in its place by means of a compressing collar\nforced hard down by strong screws.  The defect of this arrangement was,\nthat, even supposing the packing could be made sufficiently tight to\nresist the passage of the water urged by the tremendous pressure from\nbeneath, such was the grip which the compressed material took of the\nram of the press, that it could not be got to return down after the\nwater pressure had been removed.\n\nIn this dilemma, Bramah's ever-ready workman, Henry Maudslay, came to\nhis rescue.  The happy idea occurred to him of employing the pressure\nof the water itself to give the requisite water-tightness to the\ncollar.  It was a flash of common-sense genius--beautiful through its\nvery simplicity.  The result was Maudslay's self-tightening collar, the\naction of which a few words of description will render easily\nintelligible.  A collar of sound leather, the convex side upwards and\nthe concave downwards, was fitted into the recess turned out in the\nneck of the press-cylinder, at the place formerly used as a\nstuffing-box.  Immediately on the high pressure water being turned on,\nit forced its way into the leathern concavity and 'flapped out' the\nbent edges of the collar; and, in so doing, caused the leather to apply\nitself to the surface of the rising ram with a degree of closeness and\ntightness so as to seal up the joint the closer exactly in proportion\nto the pressure of the water in its tendency to escape.  On the other\nhand, the moment the  pressure was let off and the ram desired to\nreturn, the collar collapsed and the ram slid gently down, perfectly\nfree and yet perfectly water-tight.  Thus, the former tendency of the\nwater to escape by the side of the piston was by this most simple and\nelegant self-adjusting contrivance made instrumental to the perfectly\nefficient action of the machine; and from the moment of its invention\nthe hydraulic press took its place as one of the grandest agents for\nexercising power in a concentrated and tranquil form.\n\nBramah continued his useful labours as an inventor for many years.  His\nstudy of the principles of hydraulics, in the course of his invention\nof the press, enabled him to introduce many valuable improvements in\npumping-machinery.  By varying the form of the piston and cylinder he\nwas enabled to obtain a rotary motion,[3] which he advantageously\napplied to many purposes.  Thus he adopted it in the well known\nfire-engine, the use of which has almost become universal.  Another\npopular machine of his is the beer-pump, patented in 1797, by which the\npublican is enabled to raise from the casks in the cellar beneath, the\nvarious liquors sold by him over the counter.  He also took out several\npatents for the improvement of the steam-engine, in which, however,\nWatt left little room for other inventors; and hence Bramah seems to\nhave entertained a grudge against Watt, which broke out fiercely in the\nevidence given by him in the case of Boulton and Watt versus Hornblower\nand Maberly, tried in December 1796.  On that occasion his temper seems\nto have got the better of his judgment, and he was cut short by the\njudge in the attempt which he then made to submit the contents of the\npamphlet subsequently published by him in the form of a letter to the\njudge before whom the case was tried.[4]  In that pamphlet he argued\nthat Watt's specification had no definite meaning; that it was\ninconsistent and absurd, and could not possibly be understood; that the\nproposal to work steam-engines on the principle of condensation was\nentirely fallacious; that Watt's method of packing the piston was\n\"monstrous stupidity;\" that the engines of Newcomen (since entirely\nsuperseded) were infinitely superior, in all respects, to those of\nWatt;--conclusions which, we need scarcely say, have been refuted by\nthe experience of nearly a century.\n\nOn the expiry of Boulton and Watt's patent, Bramah introduced several\nvaluable improvements in the details of the condensing engine, which\nhad by that time become an established power,--the most important of\nwhich was his \"four-way cock,\" which he so arranged as to revolve\ncontinuously instead of alternately, thus insuring greater precision\nwith considerably less wear of parts.  In the same patent by which he\nsecured this invention in 1801, he also proposed sundry improvements in\nthe boilers, as well as modifications in various parts of the engine,\nwith the object of effecting greater simplicity and directness of\naction.\n\nIn his patent of 1802, we find Bramah making another great stride in\nmechanical invention, in his tools \"for producing straight, smooth, and\nparallel surfaces on wood and other materials requiring truth, in a\nmanner much more expeditious and perfect than can be performed by the\nuse of axes, saws, planes, and other cutting instruments used by hand\nin the ordinary way.\"  The specification describes the object of the\ninvention to be the saving of manual labour, the reduction in the cost\nof production, and the superior character of the work executed.  The\ntools were fixed on frames driven by machinery, some moving in a rotary\ndirection round an upright shaft, some with the shaft horizontal like\nan ordinary wood-turning lathe, while in others the tools were fixed on\nframes sliding in stationary grooves.  A wood-planing machine[5] was\nconstructed on the principle of this invention at Woolwich Arsenal,\nwhere it still continues in efficient use.  The axis of the principal\nshaft was supported on a piston in a vessel of oil, which considerably\ndiminished the friction, and it was so contrived as to be accurately\nregulated by means of a small forcing-pump.  Although the machinery\ndescribed in the patent was first applied to working on wood, it was\nequally applicable to working on metals; and in his own shops at\nPimlico Bramah employed a machine with revolving cutters to plane\nmetallic surfaces for his patent locks and other articles.  He also\nintroduced a method of turning spherical surfaces, either convex or\nconcave, by a tool moveable on an axis perpendicular to that of the\nlathe; and of cutting out concentric shells by fixing in a similar\nmanner a curved tool of nearly the same form as that employed by common\nturners for making bowls.  \"In fact,\" says Mr. Mallet, \"Bramah not only\nanticipated, but carried out upon a tolerably large scale in his own\nworks--for the construction of the patent hydraulic press, the\nwater-closet, and his locks--a surprisingly large proportion of our\nmodern tools.\" [6]  His remarkable predilection in favour of the use of\nhydraulic arrangements is displayed in his specification of the\nsurface-planing machinery, which includes a method of running pivots\nentirely on a fluid, and raising and depressing them at pleasure by\nmeans of a small forcing-pump and stop-cock,--though we are not aware\nthat any practical use has ever been made of this part of the invention.\n\nBramah's inventive genius displayed itself alike in small things as in\ngreat--in a tap wherewith to draw a glass of beer, and in a hydraulic\nmachine capable of tearing up a tree by the roots.  His powers of\ncontrivance seemed inexhaustible, and were exercised on the most\nvarious subjects.  When any difficulty occurred which mechanical\ningenuity was calculated to remove, recourse was usually had to Bramah,\nand he was rarely found at a loss for a contrivance to overcome it.\nThus, when applied to by the Bank of England in 1806, to construct a\nmachine for more accurately and expeditiously printing the numbers and\ndate lines on Bank notes, he at once proceeded to invent the requisite\nmodel, which he completed in the course of a month.  He subsequently\nbrought it to great perfection the figures in numerical succession\nbeing changed by the action of the machine itself,--and it still\ncontinues in regular use.  Its employment in the Bank of England alone\nsaved the labour of a hundred clerks; but its chief value consisted in\nits greater accuracy, the perfect legibility of the figures printed by\nit, and the greatly improved check which it afforded.\n\nWe next find him occupying himself with inventions connected with the\nmanufacture of pens and paper.  His little pen-making machine for\nreadily making quill pens long continued in use, until driven out by\nthe invention of the steel pen; but his patent for making paper by\nmachinery, though ingenious, like everything he did, does not seem to\nhave been adopted, the inventions of Fourdrinier and Donkin in this\ndirection having shortly superseded all others.  Among his other minor\ninventions may be mentioned his improved method of constructing and\nsledging carriage-wheels, and his improved method of laying\nwater-pipes.  In his specification of the last-mentioned invention, he\nincluded the application of water-power to the driving of machinery of\nevery description, and for hoisting and lowering goods in docks and\nwarehouses,--since carried out in practice, though in a different\nmanner, by Sir William Armstrong.[7]  In this, as in many other\nmatters, Bramah shot ahead of the mechanical necessities of his time;\nand hence many of his patents (of which he held at one time more than\ntwenty) proved altogether profitless.  His last patent, taken out in\n1814, was for the application of Roman cement to timber for the purpose\nof preventing dry rot.\n\nBesides his various mechanical pursuits, Bramah also followed to a\ncertain extent the profession of a civil engineer, though his more\nurgent engagements rendered it necessary for him to refuse many\nadvantageous offers of employment in this line.  He was, however, led\nto carry out the new water-works at Norwich, between the years 1790 and\n1793, in consequence of his having been called upon to give evidence in\na dispute between the corporation of that city and the lessees, in the\ncourse of which he propounded plans which, it was alleged, could not be\ncarried out.  To prove that they could be carried out, and that his\nevidence was correct, he undertook the new works, and executed them\nwith complete success; besides demonstrating in a spirited publication\nelicited by the controversy, the insufficiency and incongruity of the\nplans which had been submitted by the rival engineer.\n\nFor some time prior to his death Bramah had been employed in the\nerection of several large machines in his works at Pimlico for sawing\nstone and timber, to which he applied his hydraulic power with great\nsuccess.  New methods of building bridges and canal-locks, with a\nvariety of other matters, were in an embryo state in his mind, but he\ndid not live to complete them.  He was occupied in superintending the\naction of his hydrostatic press at Holt Forest, in Hants--where upwards\nof 300 trees of the largest dimensions were in a very short time torn\nup by the roots,--when he caught a severe cold, which settled upon his\nlungs, and his life was suddenly brought to a close on the 9th of\nDecember, 1814, in his 66th year.\n\nHis friend, Dr. Cullen Brown,[8] has said of him, that Bramah was a man\nof excellent moral character, temperate in his habits, of a pious turn\nof mind,[9] and so cheerful in temperament, that he was the life of\nevery company into which he entered.  To much facility of expression he\nadded the most perfect independence of opinion; he was a benevolent and\naffectionate man; neat and methodical in his habits, and knew well how\nto temper liberality with economy.  Greatly to his honour, he often\nkept his workmen employed, solely for their sake, when stagnation of\ntrade prevented him disposing of the products of their labour.  As a\nmanufacturer he was distinguished for his promptitude and probity, and\nhe was celebrated for the exquisite finish which he gave to all his\nproductions.  In this excellence of workmanship, which he was the first\nto introduce, he continued while he lived to be unrivalled.\n\nBramah was deservedly honoured and admired as the first mechanical\ngenius of his time, and as the founder of the art of tool-making in its\nhighest branches.  From his shops at Pimlico came Henry Maudslay,\nJoseph Clement, and many more first-class mechanics, who carried the\nmechanical arts to still higher perfection, and gave an impulse to\nmechanical engineering, the effects of which are still felt in every\nbranch of industry.\n\nThe parish to which Bramah belonged was naturally proud of the\ndistinction he had achieved in the world, and commemorated his life and\ncareer by a marble tablet erected by subscription to his memory, in the\nparish church of Silkstone.  In the churchyard are found the tombstones\nof Joseph's father, brother, and other members of the family; and we\nare informed that their descendants still occupy the farm at\nStainborough on which the great mechanician was born.\n\n\n\n[1] The lock invented by Bramah was patented in 1784.  Mr. Bramah\nhimself fully set forth the specific merits of the invention in his\nDissertation on the Construction of Locks.  In a second patent, taken\nout by him in 1798, he amended his first with the object of preventing\nthe counterfeiting of keys, and suspending the office of the lock until\nthe key was again in the possession of the owner.  This he effected by\nenabling the owner so to alter the sliders as to render the lock\ninaccessible to such key if applied by any other person but himself, or\nuntil the sliders had been rearranged so as to admit of its proper\naction.  We may mention in passing that the security of Bramah's locks\ndepends on the doctrine of combinations, or multiplication of numbers\ninto each other, which is known to increase in the most rapid\nproportion.  Thus, a lock of five slides admits of 3,000 variations,\nwhile one of eight will have no less than 1,935,360 changes; in other\nwords, that number of attempts at making a key, or at picking it, may\nbe made before it can be opened.\n\n[2] The weight raised by a single press at the Britannia Bridge was\n1144 tons.\n\n[3] Dr. Thomas Young, in his article on Bramah in the Encyclopaedia\nBritannica, describes the \"rotative principle\" as consisting in making\nthe part which acts immediately on the water in the form of a slider,\n\"sweeping round a cylindrical cavity, and kept in its place by means of\nan eccentric groove; a contrivance which was probably Bramah's own\ninvention, but which had been before described, in a form nearly\nsimilar, by Ramelli, Canalleri, Amontons, Prince Rupert, and Dr. Hooke.\n\n[4] A Letter to the Right Hon.

By Joseph Bramah, Engineer.  London,\n1797.\n\n[5] Sir Samuel Bentham and Marc Isambard Brunel subsequently\ndistinguished themselves by the invention of wood-working machinery,\nfull accounts of which will be found in the Memoirs of the former by\nLady Bentham, and in the Life of the latter by Mr. Beamish.\n\n[6] \"Record of the International Exhibition, 1862.\"  Practical\nMechanic's Journal, 293.\n\n[7] In this, as in other methods of employing power, the moderns had\nbeen anticipated by the ancients; and though hydraulic machinery is a\ncomparatively recent invention in England, it had long been in use\nabroad.  Thus we find in Dr. Bright's Travels in Lower Hungary a full\ndescription of the powerful hydraulic machinery invented by M. Holl,\nChief Engineer of the Imperial Mines, which had been in use since the\nyear 1749, in pumping water from a depth of 1800 feet, from the silver\nand gold mines of Schemnitz and Kremnitz.  A head of water was\ncollected by forming a reservoir along the mountain side, from which it\nwas conducted through water-tight cast-iron pipes erected\nperpendicularly in the mine-shaft.  About forty-five fathoms down, the\nwater descending through the pipe was forced by the weight of the\ncolumn above it into the bottom of a perpendicular cylinder, in which\nit raised a water-tight piston.  When forced up to a given point a\nself-acting stop-cock shut off the pressure of the descending column,\nwhile a self-acting valve enabled the water contained in the cylinder\nto be discharged, on which the piston again descended, and the process\nwas repeated like the successive strokes of a steam-engine.  Pump-rods\nwere attached to this hydraulic apparatus, which were carried to the\nbottom of the shaft, and each worked a pump at different levels,\nraising the water stage by stage to the level of the main adit.  The\npumps of these three several stages each raised 1790 cubic feet of\nwater from a depth of 600 feet in the hour.  The regular working of the\nmachinery was aided by the employment of a balance-beam connected by a\nchain with the head of the large piston and pump-rods; and the whole of\nthese powerful machines by means of three of which as much as 789,840\ngallons of water were pumped out of the mines every 24 hours--were set\nin operation and regulated merely by the turning of a stopcock.  It\nwill be observed that the arrangement thus briefly described was\nequally applicable to the working of machinery of all kinds, cranes,\n&c., as well as pumps; and it will be noted that, notwithstanding the\ningenuity of Bramah, Armstrong, and other eminent English mechanics,\nthe Austrian engineer Holl was thus decidedly beforehand with them in\nthe practical application of the principles of hydrostatics.\n\n[8] Dr. Brown published a brief memoir of his friend in the New Monthly\nMagazine for April, 1815, which has been the foundation of all the\nnotices of Bramah's life that have heretofore appeared.\n\n[9] Notwithstanding his well-known religious character, Bramah seems to\nhave fallen under the grievous displeasure of William Huntington, S.S.\n(Sinner Saved), described by Macaulay in his youth as \"a worthless ugly\nlad of the name of Hunter,\" and in his manhood as \"that remarkable\nimpostor\" (Essays, 1 vol. ed. 529).  It seems that Huntington sought\nthe professional services of Bramah when re-edifying his chapel in\n1793; and at the conclusion of the work, the engineer generously sent\nthe preacher a cheque for 8L. towards defraying the necessary expenses.\nWhether the sum was less than Huntington expected, or from whatever\ncause, the S.S.  contemptuously flung back the gift, as proceeding from\nan Arian whose religion was \"unsavoury,\" at the same time hurling at\nthe giver a number of texts conveying epithets of an offensive\ncharacter.  Bramah replied to the farrago of nonsense, which he\ncharacterised as \"unmannerly, absurd, and illiterate that it must have\nbeen composed when the writer was intoxicated, mad, or under the\ninfluence of Lucifer,\" and he threatened that unless Huntington\napologised for his gratuitous insults, he (Bramah) would assuredly\nexpose him.  The mechanician nevertheless proceeded gravely to explain\nand defend his \"profession of faith,\" which was altogether unnecessary.\nOn this Huntington returned to the charge, and directed against the\nmechanic a fresh volley of Scripture texts and phraseology, not without\nhumour, if profanity be allowable in controversy, as where he says,\n\"Poor man!  he makes a good patent lock, but cuts a sad figure with the\nkeys of the Kingdom of Heaven!\"  \"What Mr. Bramah is,\" says S.S., \"In\nrespect to his character or conduct in life, as a man, a tradesman, a\nneighbour, a gentleman, a husband, friend, master, or subject, I know\nnot.  In all these characters he may shine as a comet for aught I know;\nbut he appears to me to be as far from any resemblance to a poor\npenitent or broken-hearted sinner as Jannes, Jambres, or Alexander the\ncoppersmith!\"  Bramah rejoined by threatening to publish his\nassailant's letters, but Huntington anticipated him in A Feeble Dispute\nwith a Wise and Learned Man, 8vo.  London, 1793, in which, whether\njustly or not, Huntington makes Bramah appear to murder the king's\nEnglish in the most barbarous manner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHENRY MAUDSLAY.\n\n\"The successful construction of all machinery depends on the perfection\nof the tools employed; and whoever is a master in the arts of\ntool-making possesses the key to the construction of all machines.....\nThe contrivance and construction of tools must therefore ever stand at\nthe head of the industrial arts.\"--C. BABBAGE, Exposition of 1851.\n\n\nHenry Maudslay was born at Woolwich towards the end of last century, in\na house standing in the court at the back of the Salutation Inn, the\nentrance to which is nearly opposite the Arsenal gates.  His father was\na native of Lancashire, descended from an old family of the same name,\nthe head of which resided at Mawdsley Hall near Ormskirk at the\nbeginning of the seventeenth century.  The family were afterwards\nscattered, and several of its members became workmen.  William\nMaudslay, the father of Henry, belonged to the neighbourhood of Bolton,\nwhere he was brought up to the trade of a joiner.  His principal\nemployment, while working at his trade in Lancashire, consisted in\nmaking the wood framing of cotton machinery, in the construction of\nwhich cast-iron had not yet been introduced.  Having got into some\ntrouble in his neighbourhood, through some alleged LIAISON, William\nenlisted in the Royal Artillery, and the corps to which he belonged was\nshortly after sent out to the West Indies.  He was several times\nengaged in battle, and in his last action he was hit by a musket-bullet\nin the throat.  The soldier's stock which he wore had a piece cut out\nof it by the ball, the direction of which was diverted, and though\nseverely wounded, his life was saved.  He brought home the stock and\npreserved it as a relic, afterwards leaving it to his son.  Long after,\nthe son would point to the stock, hung up against his wall, and say\n\"But for that bit of leather there would have been no Henry Maudslay.\"\nThe wounded artilleryman was invalided and sent home to Woolwich, the\nheadquarters of his corps, where he was shortly after discharged.\nBeing a handy workman, he sought and obtained employment at the\nArsenal.  He was afterwards appointed a storekeeper in the Dockyard.\nIt was during the former stage of William Maudslay's employment at\nWoolwich, that the subject of this memoir was born in the house in the\ncourt above mentioned, on the 22nd of August, 1771.\n\nThe boy was early set to work.  When twelve years old he was employed\nas a \"powder-monkey,\" in making and filling cartridges.  After two\nyears, he was passed on to the carpenter's shop where his father\nworked, and there he became acquainted with tools and the art of\nworking in wood and iron.  From the first, the latter seems to have had\nby far the greatest charms for him.  The blacksmiths' shop was close to\nthe carpenters', and Harry seized every opportunity that offered of\nplying the hammer, the file, and the chisel, in preference to the saw\nand the plane.  Many a cuff did the foreman of carpenters give him for\nabsenting himself from his proper shop and stealing off to the smithy.\nHis propensity was indeed so strong that, at the end of a year, it was\nthought better, as he was a handy, clever boy, to yield to his earnest\ndesire to be placed in the smithy, and he was removed thither\naccordingly in his fifteenth year.\n\nHis heart being now in his work, he made rapid progress, and soon\nbecame an expert smith and metal worker.  He displayed his skill\nespecially in forging light ironwork; and a favourite job of his was\nthe making of \"Trivets\" out of the solid, which only the \"dab hands\" of\nthe shop could do, but which he threw off with great rapidity in first\nrate style.  These \"Trivets\" were made out of Spanish iron bolts--rare\nstuff, which, though exceedingly tough, forged like wax under the\nhammer.  Even at the close of his life, when he had acquired eminent\ndistinction as an inventor, and was a large employer of skilled labour,\nhe looked back with pride to the forging of his early days in Woolwich\nArsenal.  He used to describe with much gusto, how the old experienced\nhands, with whom he was a great favourite, would crowd about him when\nforging his \"Trivets,\" some of which may to this day be in use among\nWoolwich housewives for supporting the toast-plate before the bright\nfire against tea time.  This was, however, entirely contraband work,\ndone \"on the sly,\" and strictly prohibited by the superintending\nofficer, who used kindly to signal his approach by blowing his nose in\na peculiar manner, so that all forbidden jobs might be put out of the\nway by the time he entered the shop.\n\nWe have referred to Maudslay's early dexterity in trivet-making--a\ncircumstance trifling enough in itself--for the purpose of illustrating\nthe progress which he had made in a branch of his art of the greatest\nimportance in tool and machine making.  Nothing pleased him more in his\nafter life than to be set to work upon an unusual piece of forging, and\nto overcome, as none could do so cleverly as he, the difficulties which\nit presented.  The pride of art was as strong in him as it must have\nbeen in the mediaeval smiths, who turned out those beautiful pieces of\nworkmanship still regarded as the pride of our cathedrals and old\nmansions.  In Maudslay's case, his dexterity as a smith was eventually\ndirected to machinery, rather than ornamental work; though, had the\nlatter been his line of labour, we do not doubt that he would have\nreached the highest distinction.\n\nThe manual skill which our young blacksmith had acquired was such as to\ngive him considerable reputation in his craft, and he was spoken of\neven in the London shops as one of the most dexterous hands in the\ntrade.  It was this circumstance that shortly after led to his removal\nfrom the smithy in Woolwich Arsenal to a sphere more suitable for the\ndevelopment of his mechanical ability.\n\nWe have already stated in the preceding memoir, that Joseph Bramah took\nout the first patent for his lock in 1784, and a second for its\nimprovement several years later; but notwithstanding the acknowledged\nsuperiority of the new lock over all others, Bramah experienced the\ngreatest difficulty in getting it manufactured with sufficient\nprecision, and at such a price as to render it an article of extensive\ncommerce.  This arose from the generally inferior character of the\nworkmanship of that day, as well as the clumsiness and uncertainty of\nthe tools then in use.  Bramah found that even the best manual\ndexterity was not to be trusted, and yet it seemed to be his only\nresource; for machine-tools of a superior kind had not yet been\ninvented.  In this dilemma he determined to consult an ingenious old\nGerman artisan, then working with William Moodie, a general blacksmith\nin Whitechapel.  This German was reckoned one of the most ingenious\nworkmen in London at the time.  Bramah had several long interviews with\nhim, with the object of endeavouring to solve the difficult problem of\nhow to secure precise workmanship in lock-making.  But they could not\nsolve it; they saw that without better tools the difficulty was\ninsuperable; and then Bramah began to fear that his lock would remain a\nmere mechanical curiosity, and be prevented from coming into general\nuse.\n\nHe was indeed sorely puzzled what next to do, when one of the hammermen\nin Moodie's shop ventured to suggest that there was a young man in the\nWoolwich Arsenal smithy, named Maudslay, who was so ingenious in such\nmatters that \"nothing bet him,\" and he recommended that Mr. Bramah\nshould have a talk with him upon the subject of his difficulty.\nMaudslay was at once sent for to Bramah's workshop, and appeared before\nthe lock-maker, a tall, strong, comely young fellow, then only eighteen\nyears old.  Bramah was almost ashamed to lay his case before such a\nmere youth; but necessity constrained him to try all methods of\naccomplishing his object, and Maudslay's suggestions in reply to his\nstatement of the case were so modest, so sensible, and as the result\nproved, so practical, that the master was constrained to admit that the\nlad before him had an old head though set on young shoulders.  Bramah\ndecided to adopt the youth's suggestions, made him a present on the\nspot, and offered to give him a job if he was willing to come and work\nin a town shop.  Maudslay gladly accepted the offer, and in due time\nappeared before Bramah to enter upon his duties.\n\nAs Maudslay had served no regular apprenticeship, and was of a very\nyouthful appearance, the foreman of the shop had considerable doubts as\nto his ability to take rank alongside his experienced hands.  But\nMaudslay soon set his master's and the foreman's mind at rest.\nPointing to a worn-out vice-bench, he said to Bramah, \"Perhaps if I can\nmake that as good as new by six o'clock to-night, it will satisfy your\nforeman that I am entitled to rank as a tradesman and take my place\namong your men, even though I have not served a seven years'\napprenticeship.\"  There was so much self-reliant ability in the\nproposal, which was moreover so reasonable, that it was at once acceded\nto.  Off went Maudslay's coat, up went his shirt sleeves, and to work\nhe set with a will upon the old bench.  The vice-jaws were re-steeled\n\"in no time,\" filed up, re-cut, all the parts cleaned and made trim,\nand set into form again.  By six o'clock, the old vice was screwed up\nto its place, its jaws were hardened and \"let down\" to proper temper,\nand the old bench was made to look so smart and neat that it threw all\nthe neighbouring benches into the shade!  Bramah and his foreman came\nround to see it, while the men of the shop looked admiringly on.  It\nwas examined and pronounced \"a first-rate job.\" This diploma piece of\nwork secured Maudslay's footing, and next Monday morning he came on as\none of the regular hands.\n\nHe soon took rank in the shop as a first-class workman.  Loving his\nart, he aimed at excellence in it, and succeeded.  For it must be\nunderstood that the handicraftsman whose heart is in his calling, feels\nas much honest pride in turning out a piece of thoroughly good\nworkmanship, as the sculptor or the painter does in executing a statue\nor a picture.  In course of time, the most difficult and delicate jobs\ncame to be entrusted to Maudslay; and nothing gave him greater pleasure\nthan to be set to work upon an entirely new piece of machinery.  And\nthus he rose, naturally and steadily, from hand to head work.  For his\nmanual dexterity was the least of his gifts.  He possessed an intuitive\npower of mechanical analysis and synthesis.  He had a quick eye to\nperceive the arrangements requisite to effect given purposes; and\nwhenever a difficulty arose, his inventive mind set to work to overcome\nit.\n\nHis fellow-workmen were not slow to recognise his many admirable\nqualities, of hand, mind, and heart; and he became not only the\nfavourite, but the hero of the shop.  Perhaps he owed something to his\nfine personal appearance.  Hence on gala-days, when the men turned out\nin procession, \"Harry\" was usually selected to march at their head and\ncarry the flag.  His conduct as a son, also, was as admirable as his\nqualities as a workman.  His father dying shortly after Maudslay\nentered Bramah's concern, he was accustomed to walk down to Woolwich\nevery Saturday night, and hand over to his mother, for whom he had the\ntenderest regard, a considerable share of his week's wages, and this he\ncontinued to do as long as she lived.\n\nNotwithstanding his youth, he was raised from one post to another,\nuntil he was appointed, by unanimous consent, the head foreman of the\nworks; and was recognised by all who had occasion to do business there\nas \"Bramah's right-hand man.\"  He not only won the heart of his master,\nbut--what proved of far greater importance to him--he also won the\nheart of his master's pretty housemaid, Sarah Tindel by name, whom he\nmarried, and she went hand-in-hand with him through life, an admirable\n\"help meet,\" in every way worthy of the noble character of the great\nmechanic.  Maudslay was found especially useful by his master in\ndevising the tools for making his patent locks; and many were the\nbeautiful contrivances which he invented for the purpose of ensuring\ntheir more accurate and speedy manufacture, with a minimum degree of\nlabour, and without the need of any large amount of manual dexterity on\nthe part of the workman.  The lock was so delicate a machine, that the\nidentity of the several parts of which it was composed was found to be\nan absolute necessity.  Mere handicraft, however skilled, could not\nsecure the requisite precision of workmanship; nor could the parts be\nturned out in sufficient quantity to meet any large demand.  It was\ntherefore requisite to devise machine-tools which should not blunder,\nnor turn out imperfect work;--machines, in short, which should be in a\ngreat measure independent of the want of dexterity of individual\nworkmen, but which should unerringly labour in their prescribed track,\nand do the work set them, even in the minutest details, after the\nmethods designed by their inventor.  In this department Maudslay was\neminently successful, and to his laborious ingenuity, as first\ndisplayed in Bramah's workshops, and afterwards in his own\nestablishment, we unquestionably owe much of the power and accuracy of\nour present self-acting machines.\n\nBramah himself was not backward in admitting that to Henry Maudslay's\npractical skill in contriving the machines for manufacturing his locks\non a large scale, the success of his invention was in a great degree\nattributable.  In further proof of his manual dexterity, it may be\nmentioned that he constructed with his own hands the identical padlock\nwhich so severely tested the powers of Mr. Hobbs in 1851.  And when it\nis considered that the lock had been made for more than half a century,\nand did not embody any of the modern improvements, it will perhaps be\nregarded not only as creditable to the principles on which it was\nconstructed, but to the workmanship of its maker, that it should so\nlong have withstood the various mechanical dexterity to which it was\nexposed.\n\nBesides the invention of improved machine-tools for the manufacture of\nlocks, Maudslay was of further service to Bramah in applying the\nexpedient to his famous Hydraulic Press, without which it would\nprobably have remained an impracticable though a highly ingenious\nmachine.  As in other instances of great inventions, the practical\nsuccess of the whole is often found to depend upon the action of some\napparently trifling detail.  This was especially the case with the\nhydraulic press; to which Maudslay added the essential feature of the\nself-tightening collar, above described in the memoir of Bramah.  Mr.\nJames Nasmyth is our authority for ascribing this invention to\nMaudslay, who was certainly quite competent to have made it; and it is\na matter of fact that Bramah's specification of the press says nothing\nof the hollow collar,[1] on which its efficient action mainly depends.\nMr. Nasmyth says--\"Maudslay himself told me, or led me to believe, that\nit was he who invented the self-tightening collar for the hydraulic\npress, without which it would never have been a serviceable machine.\nAs the self-tightening collar is to the hydraulic press, so is the\nsteamblast to the locomotive.  It is the one thing needful that has\nmade it effective in practice.  If Maudslay was the inventor of the\ncollar, that one contrivance ought to immortalize him.  He used to tell\nme of it with great gusto, and I have no reason to doubt the\ncorrectness of his statement.\"  Whoever really struck out the idea of\nthe collar, displayed the instinct of the true inventor, who invariably\nseeks to accomplish his object by the adoption of the simplest possible\nmeans.\n\nDuring the time that Maudslay held the important office of manager of\nBramah's works, his highest wages were not more than thirty shillings\na-week.  He himself thought that he was worth more to his master--as\nindeed he was,--and he felt somewhat mortified that he should have to\nmake an application for an advance; but the increasing expenses of his\nfamily compelled him in a measure to do so.  His application was\nrefused in such a manner as greatly to hurt his sensitive feelings; and\nthe result was that he threw up his situation, and determined to begin\nworking on his own account.\n\nHis first start in business was in the year 1797, in a small workshop\nand smithy situated in Wells Street, Oxford Street.  It was in an awful\nstate of dirt and dilapidation when he became its tenant.  He entered\nthe place on a Friday, but by the Saturday evening, with the help of\nhis excellent wife, he had the shop thoroughly cleaned, whitewashed,\nand put in readiness for beginning work on the next Monday morning.  He\nhad then the pleasure of hearing the roar of his own forge-fire, and\nthe cheering ring of the hammer on his own anvil; and great was the\npride he felt in standing for the first time within his own smithy and\nexecuting orders for customers on his own account.  His first customer\nwas an artist, who gave him an order to execute the iron work of a\nlarge easel, embodying some new arrangements; and the work was\npunctually done to his employer's satisfaction.  Other orders followed,\nand he soon became fully employed.  His fame as a first-rate workman\nwas almost as great as that of his former master; and many who had been\naccustomed to do business with him at Pimlico followed him to Wells\nStreet.  Long years after, the thought of these early days of\nself-dependence and hard work used to set him in a glow, and he would\ndilate to his intimate friends up on his early struggles and his first\nsuccesses, which were much more highly prized by him than those of his\nmaturer years.\n\nWith a true love of his craft, Maudslay continued to apply himself, as\nhe had done whilst working as Bramah's foreman, to the best methods of\nensuring accuracy and finish of work, so as in a measure to be\nindependent of the carelessness or want of dexterity of the workman.\nWith this object he aimed at the contrivance of improved machine-tools,\nwhich should be as much self-acting and self-regulating as possible;\nand it was while pursuing this study that he wrought out the important\nmechanical invention with which his name is usually identified--that of\nthe Slide Rest.  It continued to be his special delight, when engaged\nin the execution of any piece of work in which he took a personal\ninterest, to introduce a system of identity of parts, and to adapt for\nthe purpose some one or other of the mechanical contrivances with which\nhis fertile brain was always teeming.  Thus it was from his desire to\nleave nothing to the chance of mere individual dexterity of hand that\nhe introduced the slide rest in the lathe, and rendered it one of the\nmost important of machine-tools.  The first device of this kind was\ncontrived by him for Bramah, in whose shops it continued in practical\nuse long after he had begun business for himself.  \"I have seen the\nslide rest,\" says Mr. James Nasmyth, \"the first that Henry Maudslay\nmade, in use at Messrs. Bramah's workshops, and in it were all those\narrangements which are to be found in the most modern slide rest of our\nown day,[2] all of which are the legitimate offspring of Maudslay's\noriginal rest.  If this tool be yet extant, it ought to be preserved\nwith the greatest care, for it was the beginning of those mechanical\ntriumphs which give to the days in which we live so much of their\ndistinguishing character.\"\n\nA very few words of explanation will serve to illustrate the importance\nof Maudslay's invention.  Every person is familiar with the uses of the\ncommon turning-lathe.  It is a favourite machine with amateur\nmechanics, and its employment is indispensable for the execution of all\nkinds of rounded work in wood and metal.  Perhaps there is no\ncontrivance by which the skill of the handicraftsman has been more\neffectually aided than by this machine.  Its origin is lost in the\nshades of antiquity.  Its most ancient form was probably the potter's\nwheel, from which it advanced, by successive improvements, to its\npresent highly improved form.  It was found that, by whatever means a\nsubstance capable of being cut could be made to revolve with a circular\nmotion round a fixed right line as a centre, a cutting tool applied to\nits surface would remove the inequalities so that any part of such\nsurface should be equidistant from that centre.  Such is the\nfundamental idea of the ordinary turning-lathe.  The ingenuity and\nexperience of mechanics working such an instrument enabled them to add\nmany improvements to it; until the skilful artisan at length produced\nnot merely circular turning of the most beautiful and accurate\ndescription, but exquisite figure-work, and complicated geometrical\ndesigns, depending upon the cycloidal and eccentric movements which\nwere from time to time added to the machine.\n\nThe artisans of the Middle Ages were very skilful in the use of the\nlathe, and turned out much beautiful screen and stall work, still to be\nseen in our cathedrals, as well as twisted and swash-work for the\nbalusters of staircases and other ornamental purposes.  English\nmechanics seem early to have distinguished themselves as improvers of\nthe lathe; and in Moxon's 'Treatise on Turning,' published in 1680, we\nfind Mr. Thomas Oldfield, at the sign of the Flower-de-Luce, near the\nSavoy in the Strand, named as an excellent maker of oval-engines and\nswash-engines, showing that such machines were then in some demand.\nThe French writer Plumier[3] also mentions an ingenious modification of\nthe lathe by means of which any kind of reticulated form could be given\nto the work; and, from it's being employed to ornament the handles of\nknives, it was called by him the \"Machine a manche de Couteau\nd'Angleterre.\"  But the French artisans were at that time much better\nskilled than the English in the use of tools, and it is most probable\nthat we owe to the Flemish and French Protestant workmen who flocked\ninto England in such large numbers during the religious persecutions of\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the improvement, if not the\nintroduction, of the art of turning, as well as many other arts\nhereafter to be referred to.  It is certain that at the period to which\nwe refer numerous treatises were published in France on the art of\nturning, some of them of a most elaborate character.  Such were the\nworks of De la Hire,[4] who described how every kind of polygon might\nbe made by the lathe; De la Condamine,[5] who showed how a lathe could\nturn all sorts of irregular figures by means of tracers; and of Grand\nJean, Morin,[6] Plumier, Bergeron, and many other writers.\n\nThe work of Plumier is especially elaborate, entering into the\nconstruction of the lathe in its various parts, the making of the tools\nand cutters, and the different motions to be given to the machine by\nmeans of wheels, eccentrics, and other expedients, amongst which may be\nmentioned one very much resembling the slide rest and planing-machine\ncombined.[7]  From this work it appears that turning had long been a\nfavourite pursuit in France with amateurs of all ranks, who spared no\nexpense in the contrivance and perfection of elaborate machinery for\nthe production of complex figures.[8]  There was at that time a great\npassion for automata in France, which gave rise to many highly\ningenious devices, such as Camus's miniature carriage (made for Louis\nXIV. when a child), Degennes' mechanical peacock, Vancanson's duck, and\nMaillardet's conjuror.  It had the effect of introducing among the\nhigher order of artists habits of nice and accurate workmanship in\nexecuting delicate pieces of machinery; and the same combination of\nmechanical powers which made the steel spider crawl, the duck quack, or\nwaved the tiny rod of the magician, contributed in future years to\npurposes of higher import,--the wheels and pinions, which in these\nautomata almost eluded the human senses by their minuteness,\nreappearing in modern times in the stupendous mechanism of our\nself-acting lathes, spinning-mules, and steam-engines.\n\n\"In our own country,\" says Professor Willis, \"the literature of this\nsubject is so defective that it is very difficult to discover what\nprogress we were making during the seventeenth and eighteenth\ncenturies.\" [9]  We believe the fact to be, that the progress made in\nEngland down to the end of last century had been very small indeed, and\nthat the lathe had experienced little or no improvement until Maudslay\ntook it in hand.  Nothing seems to have been known of the slide rest\nuntil he re-invented it and applied it to the production of machinery\nof a far more elaborate character than had ever before been\ncontemplated as possible.  Professor Willis says that Bramah's, in\nother words Maudslay's, slide rest of 1794 is so different from that\ndescribed in the French 'Encyclopedie in 1772, that the two could not\nhave had a common origin.  We are therefore led to the conclusion that\nMaudslay's invention was entirely independent of all that had gone\nbefore, and that he contrived it for the special purpose of overcoming\nthe difficulties which he himself experienced in turning out duplicate\nparts in large numbers.  At all events, he was so early and zealous a\npromoter of its use, that we think he may, in the eyes of all practical\nmechanics, stand as the parent of its introduction to the workshops of\nEngland.\n\nIt is unquestionable that at the time when Maudslay began the\nimprovement of machine-tools, the methods of working in wood and metals\nwere exceedingly imperfect.  Mr. William Fairbairn has stated that when\nhe first became acquainted with mechanical engineering, about sixty\nyears ago, there were no self-acting tools; everything was executed by\nhand.  There were neither planing, slotting, nor shaping machines; and\nthe whole stock of an engineering or machine establishment might be\nsummed up in a few ill-constructed lathes, and a few drills and boring\nmachines of rude construction.[10]  Our mechanics were equally backward\nin contrivances for working in wood.  Thus, when Sir Samuel Bentham\nmade a tour through the manufacturing districts of England in 1791, he\nwas surprised to find how little had been done to substitute the\ninvariable accuracy of machinery for the uncertain dexterity of the\nhuman hand.  Steam-power was as yet only employed in driving\nspinning-machines, rolling metals, pumping water, and such like\npurposes.  In the working of wood no machinery had been introduced\nbeyond the common turning-lathe and some saws, and a few boring tools\nused in making blocks for the navy.  Even saws worked by inanimate\nforce for slitting timber, though in extensive use in foreign\ncountries, were nowhere to be found in Great Britain.[11]  As\neverything depended on the dexterity of hand and correctness of eye of\nthe workmen, the work turned out was of very unequal merit, besides\nbeing exceedingly costly.  Even in the construction of comparatively\nsimple machines, the expense was so great as to present a formidable\nobstacle to their introduction and extensive use; and but for the\ninvention of  machine-making tools, the use of the steam-engine in the\nvarious forms in which it is now applied for the production of power\ncould never have become general.\n\nIn turning a piece of work on the old-fashioned lathe, the workman\napplied and guided his tool by means of muscular strength.  The work\nwas made to revolve, and the turner, holding the cutting tool firmly\nupon the long, straight, guiding edge of the rest, along which he\ncarried it, and pressing its point firmly against the article to be\nturned, was thus enabled to reduce its surface to the required size and\nshape.  Some dexterous turners were able, with practice and\ncarefulness, to execute very clever pieces of work by this simple\nmeans.  But when the article to be turned was of considerable size, and\nespecially when it was of metal, the expenditure of muscular strength\nwas so great that the workman soon became exhausted.  The slightest\nvariation in the pressure of the tool led to an irregularity of\nsurface; and with the utmost care on the workman's part, he could not\navoid occasionally cutting a little too deep, in consequence of which\nhe must necessarily go over the surface again, to reduce the whole to\nthe level of that accidentally cut too deep; and thus possibly the job\nwould be altogether spoiled by the diameter of the article under\noperation being made too small for its intended purpose.\n\nThe introduction of the slide rest furnished a complete remedy for this\nsource of imperfection.  The principle of the invention consists in\nconstructing and fitting the rest so that, instead of being screwed\ndown to one place, and the tool in the hands of the workman travelling\nover it, the rest shall itself hold the cutting tool firmly fixed in\nit, and slide along the surface of the bench in a direction exactly\nparallel with the axis of the work.  Before its invention various\nmethods had been tried with the object of enabling the work to be\nturned true independent of the dexterity of the workman.  Thus, a\nsquare steel cutter used to be firmly fixed in a bed, along which it\nwas wedged from point to point of the work, and tolerable accuracy was\nin this way secured.  But the slide rest was much more easily managed,\nand the result was much more satisfactory.  All that the workman had to\ndo, after the tool was firmly fitted into the rest, was merely to turn\na screw-handle, and thus advance the cutter along the face of the work\nas required, with an expenditure of strength so slight as scarcely to\nbe appreciable.  And even this labour has now been got rid of; for, by\nan arrangement of the gearing, the slide itself has been made\nself-acting, and advances with the revolution of the work in the lathe,\nwhich thus supplies the place of the workman's hand.  The accuracy of\nthe turning done by this beautiful yet simple arrangement is as\nmechanically perfect as work can be.  The pair of steel fingers which\nhold the cutting tool firmly in their grasp never tire, and it moves\nalong the metal to be cut with an accuracy and precision which the\nhuman hand, however skilled, could never equal.\n\nThe effects of the introduction of the slide rest were very shortly\nfelt in all departments of mechanism.  Though it had to encounter some\nof the ridicule with which new methods of working are usually received,\nand for a time was spoken of in derision as \"Maudslay's Go-cart,\"--its\npractical advantages were so decided that it gradually made its way,\nand became an established tool in all the best mechanical workshops.\nIt was found alike capable of executing the most delicate and the most\nponderous pieces of machinery; and as slide-lathes could be\nmanufactured to any extent, machinery, steam-engines, and all kinds of\nmetal work could now be turned out in a quantity and at a price that,\nbut for its use, could never have been practicable.  In course of time\nvarious modifications of the machine were introduced--such as the\nplaning machine, the wheel-cutting machine, and other beautiful tools\non the slide-rest principle,--the result of which has been that\nextraordinary development of mechanical production and power which is\nso characteristic a feature of the age we live in.\n\n\"It is not, indeed, saying at all too much to state,\" says Mr.\nNasmyth,[12] a most competent judge in such a matter, \"that its\ninfluence in improving and extending the use of machinery has been as\ngreat as that produced by the improvement of the steam-engine in\nrespect to perfecting manufactures and extending commerce, inasmuch as\nwithout the aid of the vast accession to our power of producing perfect\nmechanism which it at once supplied, we could never have worked out\ninto practical and profitable forms the conceptions of those master\nminds who, during the last half century, have so successfully pioneered\nthe way for mankind.  The steam-engine itself, which supplies us with\nsuch unbounded power, owes its present perfection to this most\nadmirable means of giving to metallic objects the most precise and\nperfect geometrical forms.  How could we, for instance, have good\nsteam-engines if we had not the means of boring out a true cylinder, or\nturning a true piston-rod, or planing a valve face? It is this alone\nwhich has furnished us with the means of carrying into practice the\naccumulated result's of scientific investigation on mechanical\nsubjects.  It would be blamable indeed,\" continues Mr. Nasmyth, \"after\nhaving endeavoured to set forth the vast advantages which have been\nconferred on the mechanical world, and therefore on mankind generally,\nby the invention and introduction of the Slide Rest, were I to suppress\nthe name of that admirable individual to whom we are indebted for this\npowerful agent towards the attainment of mechanical perfection.  I\nallude to Henry Maudslay, whose useful life was enthusiastically\ndevoted to the grand object of improving our means of producing perfect\nworkmanship and machinery:  to him we are certainly indebted for the\nslide rest, and, consequently, to say the least, we are indirectly so\nfor the vast benefits which have resulted from the introduction of so\npowerful an agent in perfecting our machinery and mechanism generally.\nThe indefatigable care which he took in inculcating and diffusing among\nhis workmen, and mechanical men generally, sound ideas of practical\nknowledge and refined views of construction, have rendered and ever\nwill continue to render his name identified with all that is noble in\nthe ambition of a lover of mechanical perfection.\"\n\nOne of the first uses to which Mr. Maudslay applied the improved slide\nrest, which he perfected shortly after beginning business in Margaret\nStreet, Cavendish Square, was in executing the requisite tools and\nmachinery required by Mr. (afterwards Sir Marc Isambard) Brunel for\nmanufacturing ships' blocks.  The career of Brunel was of a more\nromantic character than falls to the ordinary lot of mechanical\nengineers.  His father was a small farmer and postmaster, at the\nvillage of Hacqueville, in Normandy, where Marc Isambard was born in\n1769.  He was early intended for a priest, and educated accordingly.\nBut he was much fonder of the carpenter's shop than of the school; and\ncoaxing, entreaty, and punishment alike failed in making a hopeful\nscholar of him.  He drew faces and plans until his father was almost in\ndespair.  Sent to school at Rouen, his chief pleasure was in watching\nthe ships along the quays; and one day his curiosity was excited by the\nsight of some large iron castings just landed.  What were they? How had\nthey been made? Where did they come from? His eager inquiries were soon\nanswered.  They were parts of an engine intended for the great Paris\nwater-works; the engine was to pump water by the power of steam; and\nthe castings had been made in England, and had just been landed from an\nEnglish ship.  \"England!\" exclaimed the boy, \"ah! when I am a man I\nwill go see the country where such grand machines are made!\" On one\noccasion, seeing a new tool in a cutler's window, he coveted it so much\nthat he pawned his hat to possess it.  This was not the right road to\nthe priesthood; and his father soon saw that it was of no use urging\nhim further:  but the boy's instinct proved truer than the father's\njudgment.\n\nIt was eventually determined that he should qualify himself to enter\nthe royal navy, and at seventeen he was nominated to serve in a\ncorvette as \"volontaire d'honneur.\"  His ship was paid off in 1792, and\nhe was at Paris during the trial of the King.  With the incautiousness\nof youth he openly avowed his royalist opinions in the cafe which he\nfrequented.  On the very day that Louis was condemned to death, Brunel\nhad an angry altercation with some ultra-republicans, after which he\ncalled to his dog, \"Viens, citoyen!\"  Scowling looks were turned upon\nhim, and he deemed it expedient to take the first opportunity of\nescaping from the house, which he did by a back-door, and made the best\nof his way to Hacqueville.  From thence he went to Rouen, and succeeded\nin finding a passage on board an American ship, in which he sailed for\nNew York, having first pledged his affections to an English girl,\nSophia Kingdom, whom he had accidentally met at the house of Mr.\nCarpentier, the American consul at Rouen.\n\nArrived in America, he succeeded in finding employment as assistant\nsurveyor of a tract of land along the Black River, near Lake Ontario.\nIn the intervals of his labours he made occasional visits to New York,\nand it was there that the first idea of his block-machinery occurred to\nhim.  He carried his idea back with him into the woods, where it often\nmingled with his thoughts of Sophia Kingdom, by this time safe in\nEngland after passing through the horrors of a French prison.  \"My\nfirst thought of the block-machinery,\" he once said, \"was at a dinner\nparty at Major-General Hamilton's, in New York; my second under an\nAmerican tree, when, one day that I was carving letters on its bark,\nthe turn of one of them reminded me of it, and I thought, 'Ah! my\nblock! so it must be.' And what do you think were the letters I was\ncutting? Of course none other than S.  K.\"  Brunel subsequently\nobtained some employment as an architect in New York, and promulgated\nvarious plans for improving the navigation of the principal rivers.\nAmong the designs of his which were carried out, was that of the Park\nTheatre at New York, and a cannon foundry, in which he introduced\nimprovements in casting and boring big guns.  But being badly paid for\nhis work, and a powerful attraction drawing him constantly towards\nEngland, he determined to take final leave of America, which he did in\n1799, and landed at Falmouth in the following March.  There he again\nmet Miss Kingdom, who had remained faithful to him during his six long\nyears of exile, and the pair were shortly after united for life.\n\nBrunel was a prolific inventor.  During his residence in America, he\nhad planned many contrivances in his mind, which he now proceeded to\nwork out.  The first was a duplicate writing and drawing machine, which\nhe patented.  The next was a machine for twisting cotton thread and\nforming it into balls; but omitting to protect it by a patent, he\nderived no benefit from the invention, though it shortly came into very\ngeneral use.  He then invented a machine for trimmings and borders for\nmuslins, lawns, and cambrics,--of the nature of a sewing machine.  His\nfamous block-machinery formed the subject of his next patent.\n\nIt may be explained that the making of the blocks employed in the\nrigging of ships for raising and lowering the sails, masts, and yards,\nwas then a highly important branch of manufacture.  Some idea may be\nformed of the number used in the Royal Navy alone, from the fact that a\n74-gun ship required to be provided with no fewer than 1400 blocks of\nvarious sizes.  The sheaved blocks used for the running rigging\nconsisted of the shell, the sheaves, which revolved within the shell,\nand the pins which fastened them together.  The fabrication of these\narticles, though apparently simple, was in reality attended with much\ndifficulty.  Every part had to be fashioned with great accuracy and\nprecision to ensure the easy working of the block when put together, as\nany hitch in the raising or lowering of the sails might, on certain\nemergencies, occasion a serious disaster.  Indeed, it became clear that\nmere hand-work was not to be relied on in the manufacture of these\narticles, and efforts were early made to produce them by means of\nmachinery of the most perfect kind that could be devised.  In 1781, Mr.\nTaylor, of Southampton, set up a large establishment on the river\nItchen for their manufacture; and on the expiry of his contract, the\nGovernment determined to establish works of their own in Portsmouth\nDockyard, for the purpose at the same time of securing greater economy,\nand of being independent of individual makers in the supply of an\narticle of such importance in the equipment of ships.\n\nSir Samuel Bentham, who then filled the office of Inspector-General of\nNaval Works, was a highly ingenious person, and had for some years been\napplying his mind to the invention of improved machinery for working in\nwood.  He had succeeded in introducing into the royal dockyards\nsawing-machines and planing-machines of a superior kind, as well as\nblock-making machines.  Thus the specification of one of his patents,\ntaken out in 1793, clearly describes a machine for shaping the shells\nof the blocks, in a manner similar to that afterwards specified by\nBrunel.  Bentham had even proceeded with the erection of a building in\nPortsmouth Dockyard for the manufacture of the blocks after his method,\nthe necessary steam-engine being already provided; but with a singular\ndegree of candour and generosity, on Brunel's method being submitted to\nhim, Sir Samuel at once acknowledged its superiority to his own, and\npromised to recommend its adoption by the authorities in his department.\n\nThe circumstance of Mrs. Brunel's brother being Under-Secretary to the\nNavy Board at the time, probably led Brunel in the first instance to\noffer his invention to the Admiralty.  A great deal, however, remained\nto be done before he could bring his ideas of the block-machinery into\na definite shape; for there is usually a wide interval between the\nfirst conception of an intricate machine and its practical realization.\nThough Brunel had a good knowledge of mechanics, and was able to master\nthe intricacies of any machine, he laboured under the disadvantage of\nnot being a practical mechanic and it is probable that but for the help\nof someone possessed of this important qualification, his invention,\ningenious and important though it was, would have borne no practical\nfruits.  It was at this juncture that he was so fortunate as to be\nintroduced to Henry Maudslay, the inventor of the sliderest.\n\nIt happened that a M. de Bacquancourt, one of the French emigres, of\nwhom there were then so many in London, was accustomed almost daily to\npass Maudslay's little shop in Wells-street, and being himself an\namateur turner, he curiously inspected the articles from time to time\nexhibited in the window of the young mechanic.  One day a more than\nordinarily nice piece of screw-cutting made its appearance, on which he\nentered the shop to make inquiries as to the method by which it had\nbeen executed.  He had a long conversation with Maudslay, with whom he\nwas greatly pleased; and he was afterwards accustomed to look in upon\nhim occasionally to see what new work was going on.  Bacquancourt was\nalso on intimate terms with Brunel, who communicated to him the\ndifficulty he had experienced in finding a mechanic of sufficient\ndexterity to execute his design of the block-making machinery.  It\nimmediately occurred to the former that Henry Maudslay was the very man\nto execute work of the elaborate character proposed, and he described\nto Brunel the new and beautiful tools which Maudslay had contrived for\nthe purpose of ensuring accuracy and finish.  Brunel at once determined\nto call upon Maudslay, and it was arranged that Bacquancourt should\nintroduce him, which he did, and after the interview which took place\nBrunel promised to call again with the drawings of his proposed model.\n\nA few days passed, and Brunel called with the first drawing, done by\nhimself; for he was a capital draughtsman, and used to speak of drawing\nas the \"alphabet of the engineer.\"  The drawing only showed a little\nbit of the intended machine, and Brunel did not yet think it advisable\nto communicate to Maudslay the precise object he had in view; for\ninventors are usually very chary of explaining their schemes to others,\nfor fear of being anticipated.  Again Brunel appeared at Maudslay's\nshop with a further drawing, still not explaining his design; but at\nthe third visit, immediately on looking at the fresh drawings he had\nbrought, Maudslay exclaimed, \"Ah! now I see what you are thinking of;\nyou want machinery for making blocks.\" At this Brunel became more\ncommunicative, and explained his designs to the mechanic, who fully\nentered into his views, and went on from that time forward striving to\nhis utmost to work out the inventor's conceptions and embody them in a\npractical machine.\n\nWhile still occupied on the models, which were begun in 1800, Maudslay\nremoved his shop from Wells-street, where he was assisted by a single\njourneyman, to Margaret-street, Cavendish-square, where he had greater\nroom for carrying on his trade, and was also enabled to increase the\nnumber of his hands.  The working models were ready for inspection by\nSir Samuel Bentham and the Lords of the Admiralty in 1801, and having\nbeen fully approved by them, Brunel was authorized to proceed with the\nexecution of the requisite machinery for the manufacture of the ship's\nblocks required for the Royal Navy.  The whole of this machinery was\nexecuted by Henry Maudslay; it occupied him very fully for nearly six\nyears, so that the manufacture of blocks by the new process was not\nbegun until September, 1808.\n\nWe despair of being able to give any adequate description in words of\nthe intricate arrangements and mode of action of the block-making\nmachinery.  Let any one attempt to describe the much more simple and\nfamiliar process by which a shoemaker makes a pair of shoes, and he\nwill find how inadequate mere words are to describe any mechanical\noperation.[13]  Suffice it to say, that the machinery was of the most\nbeautiful manufacture and finish, and even at this day will bear\ncomparison with the most perfect machines which can be turned out with\nall the improved appliances of modern tools.  The framing was of\ncast-iron, while the parts exposed to violent and rapid action were all\nof the best hardened steel.  In turning out the various parts, Maudslay\nfound his slide rest of indispensable value.  Indeed, without this\ncontrivance, it is doubtful whether machinery of so delicate and\nintricate a character could possibly have been executed.  There was not\none, but many machines in the series, each devoted to a special\noperation in the formation of a block.  Thus there were various\nsawing-machines,--the Straight Cross-Cutting Saw, the Circular\nCross-Cutting Saw, the Reciprocating Ripping-saw, and the Circular\nRipping-Saw.  Then there were the Boring Machines, and the Mortising\nMachine, of beautiful construction, for cutting the sheave-holes,\nfurnished with numerous chisels, each making from 110 to 150 strokes a\nminute, and cutting at every stroke a chip as thick as pasteboard with\nthe utmost precision.  In addition to these were the Corner-Saw for\ncutting off the corners of the block, the Shaping Machine for\naccurately forming the outside surfaces, the Scoring Engine for cutting\nthe groove round the longest diameter of the block for the reception of\nthe rope, and various other machines for drilling, riveting, and\nfinishing the blocks, besides those for making the sheaves.\n\nThe total number of machines employed in the various operations of\nmaking a ship's block by the new method was forty-four; and after being\nregularly employed in Portsmouth Dockyard for upwards of fifty years,\nthey are still as perfect in their action as on the day they were\nerected.  They constitute one of the most ingenious and complete\ncollections of tools ever invented for making articles in wood, being\ncapable of performing most of the practical operations of carpentry\nwith the utmost accuracy and finish.  The machines are worked by a\nsteam-engine of 32-horse power, which is also used for various other\ndockyard purposes.  Under the new system of block-making it was found\nthat the articles were better made, supplied with much greater\nrapidity, and executed at a greatly reduced cost.  Only ten men, with\nthe new machinery, could perform the work which before had required a\nhundred and ten men to execute, and not fewer than 160,000 blocks of\nvarious kinds and sizes could be turned out in a year, worth not less\nthan 541,000L.[14]\n\nThe satisfactory execution of the block-machinery brought Maudslay a\nlarge accession of fame and business; and the premises in Margaret\nStreet proving much too limited for his requirements, he again resolved\nto shift his quarters.  He found a piece of ground suitable for his\npurpose in Westminster Road, Lambeth.  Little more than a century since\nit formed part of a Marsh, the name of which is still retained in the\nadjoining street; its principal productions being bulrushes and\nwillows, which were haunted in certain seasons by snipe and waterfowl.\nAn enterprising riding-master had erected some premises on a part of\nthe marsh, which he used for a riding-school; but the speculation not\nanswering, they were sold, and Henry Maudslay became the proprietor.\nHither he removed his machinery from Margaret Street in 1810, adding\nfresh plant from time to time as it was required; and with the aid of\nhis late excellent partner he built up the far-famed establishment of\nMaudslay, Field, and Co.  There he went on improving his old tools and\ninventing new ones, as the necessity for them arose, until the original\nslide-lathes used for making the block-machinery became thrown into the\nshade by the comparatively gigantic machine-tools of the modern school.\nYet the original lathes are still to be found in the collection of the\nfirm in Westminster Road, and continue to do their daily quota of work\nwith the same precision as they did when turned out of the hands of\ntheir inventor and maker some sixty years ago.\n\nIt is unnecessary that we should describe in any great detail the\nfurther career of Henry Maudslay.  The rest of his life was full of\nuseful and profitable work to others as well as to himself.  His\nbusiness embraced the making of flour and saw mills, mint machinery,\nand steam-engines of all kinds.  Before he left Margaret Street, in\n1807, he took out a patent for improvements in the steam-engine, by\nwhich he much simplified its parts, and secured greater directness of\naction.  His new engine was called the Pyramidal, because of its form,\nand was the first move towards what are now called Direct-acting\nEngines, in which the lateral movement of the piston is communicated by\nconnecting-rods to the rotatory movement of the crank-shaft.  Mr.\nNasmyth says of it, that \"on account of its great simplicity and\nGET-AT-ABILITY of parts, its compactness and self-contained steadiness,\nthis engine has been the parent of a vast progeny, all more or less\nmarked by the distinguishing features of the original design, which is\nstill in as high favour as ever.\"  Mr. Maudslay also directed his\nattention in like manner to the improvement of the marine engine, which\nhe made so simple and effective as to become in a great measure the\ntype of its class; and it has held its ground almost unchanged for\nnearly thirty years.  The 'Regent,' which was the first steamboat that\nplied between London and Margate, was fitted with engines by Maudslay\nin 1816; and it proved the forerunner of a vast number of marine\nengines, the manufacture of which soon became one of the most important\nbranches of mechanical engineering.\n\nAnother of Mr. Maudslay's inventions was his machine for punching\nboiler-plates, by which the production of ironwork of many kinds was\ngreatly facilitated.  This improvement originated in the contract which\nhe held for some years for supplying the Royal Navy with iron plates\nfor ships' tanks.  The operations of shearing and punching had before\nbeen very imperfectly done by hand, with great expenditure of labour.\nTo improve the style of the work and lessen the labour, Maudslay\ninvented the machine now in general use, by which the holes punched in\nthe iron plate are exactly equidistant, and the subsequent operation of\nriveting is greatly facilitated.  One of the results of the improved\nmethod was the great saving which was at once effected in the cost of\npreparing the plates to receive the rivets, the price of which was\nreduced from seven shillings per tank to ninepence.  He continued to\ndevote himself to the last to the improvement of the lathe,--in his\nopinion the master-machine, the life and soul of engine-turning, of\nwhich the planing, screw-cutting, and other machines in common use, are\nbut modifications.  In one of the early lathes which he contrived and\nmade, the mandrill was nine inches in diameter; it was driven by\nwheel-gearing like a crane motion, and adapted to different speeds.\nSome of his friends, on first looking at it, said he was going \"too\nfast;\" but he lived to see work projected on so large a scale as to\nprove that his conceptions were just, and that he had merely\nanticipated by a few years the mechanical progress of his time.  His\nlarge removable bar-lathe was a highly important tool of the same kind.\nIt was used to turn surfaces many feet in diameter.  While it could be\nused for boring wheels, or the side-rods of marine engines, it could\nturn a roller or cylinder twice or three times the diameter of its own\ncentres from the ground-level, and indeed could drive round work of any\ndiameter that would clear the roof of the shop.  This was therefore an\nalmost universal tool, capable of very extensive uses.  Indeed much of\nthe work now executed by means of special tools, such as the planing or\nslotting machine, was then done in the lathe, which was used as a\ncutter-shaping machine, fitted with various appliances according to the\nwork.\n\nMaudslay's love of accuracy also led him from an early period to study\nthe subject of improved screw-cutting.  The importance of this\ndepartment of mechanism can scarcely be overrated, the solidity and\npermanency of most mechanical structures mainly depending on the\nemployment of the screw, at the same time that the parts can be readily\nseparated for renewal or repair.  Any one can form an idea of the\nimportance of the screw as an element in mechanical construction by\nexamining say a steam-engine, and counting the number of screws\nemployed in holding it together.  Previous to the time at which the\nsubject occupied the attention of our mechanic, the tools used for\nmaking screws were of the most rude and inexact kind.  The screws were\nfor the most part cut by hand:  the small by filing, the larger by\nchipping and filing.  In consequence of the great difficulty of making\nthem, as few were used as possible; and cotters, cotterils, or\nforelocks, were employed instead.  Screws, however, were to a certain\nextent indispensable; and each manufacturing establishment made them\nafter their own fashion.  There was an utter want of uniformity.  No\nsystem was observed as to \"pitch,\" i.e.  the number of threads to the\ninch, nor was any rule followed as to the form of those threads.  Every\nbolt and nut was sort of specialty in itself, and neither owed nor\nadmitted of any community with its neighbours.  To such an extent was\nthis irregularity carried, that all bolts and their corresponding nuts\nhad to be marked as belonging to each other; and any mixing of them\ntogether led to endless trouble, hopeless confusion, and enormous\nexpense.  Indeed none but those who lived in the comparatively early\ndays of machine-manufacture can form an adequate idea of the annoyance\noccasioned by the want of system in this branch of detail, or duly\nappreciate the services rendered by Maudslay to mechanical engineering\nby the practical measures which he was among the first to introduce for\nits remedy.  In his system of screw-cutting machinery, his taps and\ndies, and screw-tackle generally, he laid the foundations of all that\nhas since been done in this essential branch of machine-construction,\nin which he was so ably followed up by several of the eminent mechanics\nbrought up in his school, and more especially by Joseph Clement and\nJoseph Whitworth.  One of his earliest self-acting screw lathes, moved\nby a guide-screw and wheels after the plan followed by the latter\nengineer, cut screws of large diameter and of any required pitch.  As\nan illustration of its completeness and accuracy, we may mention that\nby its means a screw five feet in length, and two inches in diameter,\nwas cut with fifty threads to the inch; the nut to fit on to it being\ntwelve inches long, and containing six hundred threads.  This screw was\nprincipally used for dividing scales for astronomical purposes; and by\nits means divisions were produced so minute that they could not be\ndetected without the aid of a magnifier.  The screw, which was sent for\nexhibition to the Society of Arts, is still carefully preserved amongst\nthe specimens of Maudslay's handicraft at the Lambeth Works, and is a\npiece of delicate work which every skilled mechanic will thoroughly\nappreciate.  Yet the tool by which this fine piece of turning was\nproduced was not an exceptional tool, but was daily employed in the\nordinary work of the manufactory.\n\nLike every good workman who takes pride in his craft, he kept his tools\nin first-rate order, clean, and tidily arranged, so that he could lay\nhis hand upon the thing he wanted at once, without loss of time.  They\nare still preserved in the state in which he left them, and strikingly\nillustrate his love of order, \"nattiness,\" and dexterity.  Mr. Nasmyth\nsays of him that you could see the man's character in whatever work he\nturned out; and as the connoisseur in art will exclaim at sight of a\npicture, \"That is Turner,\" or \"That is Stansfield,\" detecting the hand\nof the master in it, so the experienced mechanician, at sight of one of\nhis machines or engines, will be equally ready to exclaim, \"That is\nMaudslay;\" for the characteristic style of the master-mind is as clear\nto the experienced eye in the case of the finished machine as the\ntouches of the artist's pencil are in the case of the finished picture.\nEvery mechanical contrivance that became the subject of his study came\nforth from his hand and mind rearranged, simplified, and made new, with\nthe impress of his individuality stamped upon it.  He at once stripped\nthe subject of all unnecessary complications; for he possessed a\nwonderful faculty of KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITHOUT--the result of his\nclearness of insight into mechanical adaptations, and the accurate and\nwell-defined notions he had formed of the precise object to be\naccomplished.  \"Every member or separate machine in the system of\nblock-machinery,\" says Mr. Nasmyth, \"is full of Maudslay's presence;\nand in that machinery, as constructed by him, is to be found the parent\nof every engineering tool by the aid of which we are now achieving such\ngreat things in mechanical construction.  To the tools of which\nMaudslay furnished the prototypes are we mainly indebted for the\nperfection of our textile machinery, our locomotives, our marine\nengines, and the various implements of art, of agriculture, and of war.\nIf any one who can enter into the details of this subject will be at\nthe pains to analyse, if I may so term it, the machinery of our modern\nengineering workshops, he will find in all of them the strongly-marked\nfeatures of Maudslay's parent machine, the slide rest and slide\nsystem--whether it be a planing machine, a slotting machine, a\nslide-lathe, or any other of the wonderful tools which are now enabling\nus to accomplish so much in mechanism.\"\n\nOne of the things in which Mr. Maudslay took just pride was in the\nexcellence of his work.  In designing and executing it, his main object\nwas to do it in the best possible style and finish, altogether\nirrespective of the probable pecuniary results.  This he regarded in\nthe light of a duty he could not and would not evade, independent of\nits being a good investment for securing a future reputation; and the\ncharacter which he thus obtained, although at times purchased at great\ncost, eventually justified the soundness of his views.  As the eminent\nMr. Penn, the head of the great engineering firm, is accustomed to say,\n\"I cannot afford to turn out second-rate work,\" so Mr. Maudslay found\nboth character and profit in striving after the highest excellence in\nhis productions.  He was particular even in the minutest details.  Thus\none of the points on which he insisted--apparently a trivial matter,\nbut in reality of considerable importance in mechanical\nconstruction--was the avoidance of sharp interior angles in ironwork,\nwhether wrought or cast; for he found that in such interior angles\ncracks were apt to originate; and when the article was a tool, the\nsharp angle was less pleasant to the hand as well as to the eye.  In\nthe application of his favourite round or hollow corner system--as, for\ninstance, in the case of the points of junction of the arms of a wheel\nwith its centre and rim--he used to illustrate its superiority by\nholding up his hand and pointing out the nice rounded hollow at the\njunction of the fingers, or by referring to the junction of the\nbranches to the stem of a tree.  Hence he made a point of having all\nthe angles of his machine framework nicely rounded off on their\nexterior, and carefully hollowed in their interior angles.  In forging\nsuch articles he would so shape his metal before bending that the\nresult should be the right hollow or rounded corner when bent; the\nanticipated external angle falling into its proper place when the bar\nso shaped was brought to its ultimate form.  In all such matters of\ndetail he was greatly assisted by his early dexterity as a blacksmith;\nand he used to say that to be a good smith you must be able to SEE in\nthe bar of iron the object proposed to be got out of it by the hammer\nor the tool, just as the sculptor is supposed to see in the block of\nstone the statue which he proposes to bring forth from it by his mind\nand his chisel.\n\nMr. Maudslay did not allow himself to forget his skill in the use of\nthe hammer, and to the last he took pleasure in handling it, sometimes\nin the way of business, and often through sheer love of his art.  Mr\nNasmyth says, \"It was one of my duties, while acting as assistant in\nhis beautiful little workshop, to keep up a stock of handy bars of lead\nwhich he had placed on a shelf under his work-bench, which was of thick\nslate for the more ready making of his usual illustrative sketches of\nmachinery in chalk.  His love of iron-forging led him to take delight\nin forging the models of work to be ultimately done in iron; and cold\nlead being of about the same malleability as red-hot iron, furnished a\nconvenient material for illustrating the method to be adopted with the\nlarge work.  I well remember the smile of satisfaction that lit up his\nhonest face when he met with a good excuse for 'having a go at' one of\nthe bars of lead with hammer and anvil as if it were a bar of iron; and\nhow, with a few dexterous strokes, punchings of holes, and rounded\nnotches, he would give the rough bar or block its desired form.  He\nalways aimed at working it out of the solid as much as possible, so as\nto avoid the risk of any concealed defect, to which ironwork built up\nof welded parts is so liable; and when he had thus cleverly finished\nhis model, he used forthwith to send for the foreman of smiths, and\nshow him how he was to instruct his men as to the proper forging of the\ndesired object.\"  One of Mr. Maudslay's old workmen, when informing us\nof the skilful manner in which he handled the file, said, \"It was a\npleasure to see him handle a tool of any kind, but he was QUITE\nSPLENDID with an eighteen-inch file!\" The vice at which he worked was\nconstructed by himself, and it was perfect of its kind.  It could be\nturned round to any position on the bench; the jaws would turn from the\nhorizontal to the perpendicular or any other position--upside-down if\nnecessary--and they would open twelve inches parallel.\n\nMr. Nasmyth furnishes the following further recollections of Mr.\nMaudslay, which will serve in some measure to illustrate his personal\ncharacter.  \"Henry Maudslay,\" he says, \"lived in the days of\nsnuff-taking, which unhappily, as I think, has given way to the\ncigar-smoking system.  He enjoyed his occasional pinch very much.  It\ngenerally preceded the giving out of a new notion or suggestion for an\nimprovement or alteration of some job in hand.  As with most of those\nwho enjoy their pinch, about three times as much was taken between the\nfingers as was utilized by the nose, and the consequence was that a\nlarge unconsumed surplus collected in the folds of the master's\nwaistcoat as he sat working at his bench.  Sometimes a file, or a tool,\nor some small piece of work would drop, and then it was my duty to go\ndown on my knees and fetch it up.  On such occasions, while waiting for\nthe article, he would take the opportunity of pulling down his\nwaistcoat front, which had become disarranged by his energetic working\nat the bench; and many a time have I come up with the dropped article,\nhalf-blinded by the snuff jerked into my eyes from off his waistcoat\nfront.\n\n\"All the while he was at work he would be narrating some incident in\nhis past life, or describing the progress of some new and important\nundertaking, in illustrating which he would use the bit of chalk ready\nto his hand upon the slate bench before him, which was thus in almost\nconstant use.  One of the pleasures he indulged in while he sat at work\nwas Music, of which he was very fond,--more particularly of melodies\nand airs which took a lasting hold on his mind.  Hence he was never\nwithout an assortment of musical boxes, some of which were of a large\nsize.  One of these he would set agoing on his library table, which was\nnext to his workshop, and with the door kept open, he was thus enabled\nto enjoy the music while he sat working at his bench.  Intimate friends\nwould frequently call upon him and sit by the hour, but though talking\nall the while he never dropped his work, but continued employed on it\nwith as much zeal as if he were only beginning life.  His old friend\nSir Samuel Bentham was a frequent caller in this way, as well as Sir\nIsambard Brunel while occupied with his Thames Tunnel works[15] and Mr.\nChantrey, who was accustomed to consult him about the casting of his\nbronze statuary.  Mr. Barton of the Royal Mint, and Mr. Donkin the\nengineer, with whom Mr. Barton was associated in ascertaining and\ndevising a correct system of dividing the Standard Yard, and many\nothers, had like audience of Mr. Maudslay in his little workshop, for\nfriendly converse, for advice, or on affairs of business.\n\n\"It was a special and constant practice with him on a workman's\nholiday, or on a Sunday morning, to take a walk through his workshops\nwhen all was quiet, and then and there examine the various jobs in\nhand.  On such occasions he carried with him a piece of chalk, with\nwhich, in a neat and very legible hand, he would record his remarks in\nthe most pithy and sometimes caustic terms.  Any evidence of want of\ncorrectness in setting things square, or in 'flat filing,' which he\nheld in high esteem, or untidiness in not sweeping down the bench and\nlaying the tools in order, was sure to have a record in chalk made on\nthe spot.  If it was a mild case, the reproof was recorded in gentle\nterms, simply to show that the master's eye was on the workman; but\nwhere the case deserved hearty approbation or required equally hearty\nreproof, the words employed were few, but went straight to the mark.\nThese chalk jottings on the bench were held in the highest respect by\nthe workmen themselves, whether they conveyed praise or blame, as they\nwere sure to be deserved; and when the men next assembled, it soon\nbecame known all over the shop who had received the honour or otherwise\nof one of the master's bench memoranda in chalk.\"\n\nThe vigilant, the critical, and yet withal the generous eye of the\nmaster being over all his workmen, it will readily be understood how\nMaudslay's works came to be regarded as a first-class school for\nmechanical engineers.  Every one felt that the quality of his\nworkmanship was fully understood; and, if he had the right stuff in\nhim, and was determined to advance, that his progress in skill would be\nthoroughly appreciated.  It is scarcely necessary to point out how this\nfeeling, pervading the establishment, must have operated, not only in\nmaintaining the quality of the work, but in improving the character of\nthe workmen.  The results were felt in the increased practical ability\nof a large number of artisans, some of whom subsequently rose to the\nhighest distinction.  Indeed it may be said that what Oxford and\nCambridge are in letters, workshops such as Maudslay's and Penn's are\nin mechanics.  Nor can Oxford and Cambridge men be prouder of the\nconnection with their respective colleges than mechanics such as\nWhitworth, Nasmyth, Roberts, Muir, and Lewis, are of their connection\nwith the school of Maudslay.  For all these distinguished engineers at\none time or another formed part of his working staff, and were trained\nto the exercise of their special abilities under his own eye.  The\nresult has been a development of mechanical ability the like of which\nperhaps is not to be found in any age or country.\n\nAlthough Mr. Maudslay was an unceasing inventor, he troubled himself\nvery little about patenting his inventions.  He considered that the\nsuperiority of his tools and the excellence of his work were his surest\nprotection.  Yet he had sometimes the annoyance of being threatened\nwith actions by persons who had patented the inventions which he\nhimself had made.[16]  He was much beset by inventors, sometimes sadly\nout at elbows, but always with a boundless fortune looming before them.\nTo such as applied to him for advice in a frank and candid spirit, he\ndid not hesitate to speak freely, and communicate the results of his\ngreat experience in the most liberal manner; and to poor and deserving\nmen of this class he was often found as ready to help them with his\npurse as with his still more valuable advice.  He had a singular way of\nestimating the abilities of those who thus called upon him about their\nprojects.  The highest order of man was marked in his own mind at 100\ndegrees; and by this ideal standard he measured others, setting them\ndown at 90 degrees, 80 degrees, and so on.  A very first-rate man he\nwould set down at 95 degrees, but men of this rank were exceedingly\nrare.  After an interview with one of the applicants to him for advice,\nhe would say to his pupil Nasmyth, \"Jem, I think that man may be set\ndown at 45 degrees, but he might be WORKED UP TO 60 degrees\"--a common\nenough way of speaking of the working of a steam-engine, but a somewhat\nnovel though by no means an inexpressive method of estimating the\npowers of an individual.\n\nBut while he had much toleration for modest and meritorious inventors,\nhe had a great dislike for secret-mongers,--schemers of the close,\ncunning sort,--and usually made short work of them.  He had an almost\nequal aversion for what he called the \"fiddle-faddle inventors,\" with\ntheir omnibus patents, into which they packed every possible thing that\ntheir noddles could imagine.  \"Only once or twice in a century,\" said\nhe, \"does a great inventor appear, and yet here we have a set of\nfellows each taking out as many patents as would fill a cart,--some of\nthem embodying not a single original idea, but including in their\nspecifications all manner of modifications of well-known processes, as\nwell as anticipating the arrangements which may become practicable in\nthe progress of mechanical improvement.\" Many of these \"patents\" he\nregarded as mere pit-falls to catch the unwary; and he spoke of such\n\"inventors\" as the pests of the profession.\n\nThe personal appearance of Henry Maudslay was in correspondence with\nhis character.  He was of a commanding presence, for he stood full six\nfeet two inches in height, a massive and portly man.  His face was\nround, full, and lit up with good humour.  A fine, large, and square\nforehead, of the grand constructive order, dominated over all, and his\nbright keen eye gave energy and life to his countenance.  He was\nthoroughly \"jolly\" and good-natured, yet full of force and character.\nIt was a positive delight to hear his cheerful, ringing laugh.  He was\ncordial in manner, and his frankness set everybody at their ease who\nhad occasion to meet him, even for the first time.  No one could be\nmore faithful and consistent in his friendships, nor more firm in the\nhour of adversity.  In fine, Henry Maudslay was, as described by his\nfriend Mr. Nasmyth, the very beau ideal of an honest, upright,\nstraight-forward, hard-working, intelligent Englishman.\n\nA severe cold which he caught on his way home from one of his visits to\nFrance, was the cause of his death, which occurred on the 14th of\nFebruary, 1831.  The void which his decease caused was long and deeply\nfelt, not only by his family and his large circle of friends, but by\nhis workmen, who admired him for his industrial skill, and loved him\nbecause of his invariably manly, generous, and upright conduct towards\nthem.  He directed that he should be buried in Woolwich\nparish-churchyard, where a cast-iron tomb, made to his own design, was\nerected over his remains.  He had ever a warm heart for Woolwich, where\nhe had been born and brought up.  He often returned to it, sometimes to\ncarry his mother a share of his week's wages while she lived, and\nafterwards to refresh himself with a sight of the neighbourhood with\nwhich he had been so familiar when a boy.  He liked its green common,\nwith the soldiers about it; Shooter's Hill, with its out-look over Kent\nand down the valley of the Thames; the river busy with shipping, and\nthe royal craft loading and unloading their armaments at the dockyard\nwharves.  He liked the clangour of the Arsenal smithy where he had\nfirst learned his art, and all the busy industry of the place.  It was\nnatural, therefore, that, being proud of his early connection with\nWoolwich, he should wish to lie there; and Woolwich, on its part, let\nus add, has equal reason to be proud of Henry Maudslay.\n\n\n\n[1] The words Bramah uses in describing this part of his patent of 1795\nare these--\"The piston must be made perfectly watertight by leather or\nother materials, as used in pump-making.\"  He elsewhere speaks of the\npiston-rod \"working through the stuffing-box.\"  But in practice, as we\nhave above shown, these methods were found to be altogether inefficient.\n\n[2] In this lathe the slide rest and frame were moveable along the\ntraversing-bar, according to the length of the work, and could be\nplaced in any position and secured by a handle and screw underneath.\nThe Rest, however, afterwards underwent many important modifications;\nbut the principle of the whole machine was there.\n\n[3] PLUMIER, L'Art de Tourner, Paris, 1754, p. 155.\n\n[4] Machines approuvees par l' Academie, 1719.\n\n[5] Machines approuvees par l' Academie, 1733.\n\n[6] L'Art de Tourner en perfection, 49.\n\n[7] It consisted of two parallel bars of wood or iron connected\ntogether at both extremities by bolts or keys of sufficient width to\nadmit of the article required to be planed.

Louis\nXVI. himself was a very good locksmith, and could have earned a fair\nliving at the trade.  Our own George III. was a good turner, and was\nlearned in wheels and treadles, chucks and chisels.  Henry Mayhew says,\non the authority of an old working turner, that, with average industry,\nthe King might have made from 40s. to 50s. a-week as a hard wood and\nivory turner.  Lord John Hay, though one-armed, was an adept at the\nlatter, and Lord Gray was another capital turner.  Indeed the late Mr.\nHoltzapffel's elaborately illustrated treatise was written quite as\nmuch for amateurs as for working mechanics.  Among other noble\nhandicraftsmen we may mention the late Lord Douglas, who cultivated\nbookbinding.  Lord Traquair's fancy was cutlery, and one could not come\nto him in a more welcome fashion than with a pair of old razors to set\nup.\n\n[9] Professor WILLIS, Lectures on the Results of the Great Exhibition\nof 1851, 1st series, p. 306.\n\n[10] Address delivered before the British Association at Manchester in\n1861; and Useful Information for Engineers, 1st series, p. 22.\n\n[11] Life of Sir Samuel Bentham, 97-8.\n\n[12] Remarks on the Introduction of the Slide Principle in Tools and\nMachines employed in the Production of Machinery, in Buchanan's\nPractical Essays on Mill Work and other Machinery.  3rd ed. p. 397.\n\n[13] So far as words and drawings can serve to describe the\nblock-making machinery, it will be found very ably described by Mr.\nFarey in his article under this head in Rees's Cyclopaedia, and by Dr.\nBrewster in the Edinburgh Cyclopaedia.

The Greeks would have elevated their authors among the\ngods; nor will the enlightened judgment of modern times deny them the\nplace among their fellow-men which is so undeniably their\ndue.\"--Edinburgh Review.\n\n\nThat Skill in mechanical contrivance is a matter of education and\ntraining as well as of inborn faculty, is clear from the fact of so\nmany of our distinguished mechanics undergoing the same kind of\npractical discipline, and perhaps still more so from the circumstance\nof so many of them passing through the same workshops.  Thus Maudslay\nand Clement were trained in the workshops of Bramah; and Roberts,\nWhitworth, Nasmyth, and others, were trained in those of Maudslay.\n\nJoseph Clement was born at Great Ashby in Westmoreland, in the year\n1779.  His father was a hand-loom weaver, and a man of remarkable\nculture considering his humble station in life.  He was an ardent\nstudent of natural history, and possessed a much more complete\nknowledge of several sub-branches of that science than was to have been\nlooked for in a common working-man.  One of the departments which he\nspecially studied was Entomology.  In his leisure hours he was\naccustomed to traverse the country searching the hedge-bottoms for\nbeetles and other insects, of which he formed a remarkably complete\ncollection; and the capture of a rare specimen was quite an event in\nhis life.  In order more deliberately to study the habits of the bee\ntribe, he had a number of hives constructed for the purpose of enabling\nhim to watch their proceedings without leaving his work; and the\npursuit was a source of the greatest pleasure to him.  He was a lover\nof all dumb creatures; his cottage was haunted by birds which flew in\nand out at his door, and some of them became so tame as to hop up to\nhim and feed out of his hand.  \"Old Clement\" was also a bit of a\nmechanic, and such of his leisure moments as he did not devote to\ninsect-hunting, were employed in working a lathe of his own\nconstruction, which he used to turn his bobbing on, and also in various\nkinds of amateur mechanics.\n\nHis boy Joseph, like other poor men's sons, was early set to work.  He\nreceived very little education, and learnt only the merest rudiments of\nreading and writing at the village school.  The rest of his education\nhe gave to himself as he grew older.  His father needed his help at the\nloom, where he worked with him for some years; but, as handloom weaving\nwas gradually being driven out by improved mechanism, the father\nprudently resolved to put his son to a better trade.  They have a\nsaying in Cumberland that when the bairns reach a certain age, they are\nthrown on to the house-rigg, and that those who stick on are made\nthatchers of, while those who fall off are sent to St.  Bees to be made\nparsons of.  Joseph must have been one of those that stuck on--at all\nevents his father decided to make him a thatcher, afterwards a slater,\nand he worked at that trade for five years, between eighteen and\ntwenty-three.\n\nThe son, like the father, had a strong liking for mechanics, and as the\nslating trade did not keep him in regular employment, especially in\nwinter time, he had plenty of opportunity for following the bent of his\ninclinations.  He made a friend of the village blacksmith, whose smithy\nhe was accustomed to frequent, and there he learned to work at the\nforge, to handle the hammer and file, and in a short time to shoe\nhorses with considerable expertness.  A cousin of his named Farer, a\nclock and watchmaker by trade, having returned to the village from\nLondon, brought with him some books on mechanics, which he lent to\nJoseph to read; and they kindled in him an ardent desire to be a\nmechanic instead of a slater.  He nevertheless continued to maintain\nhimself by the latter trade for some time longer, until his skill had\ngrown; and, by way of cultivating it, he determined, with the aid of\nhis friend the village blacksmith, to make a turning-lathe.  The two\nset to work, and the result was the production of an article in every\nway superior to that made by Clement's father, which was accordingly\ndisplaced to make room for the new machine.  It was found to work very\nsatisfactorily, and by its means Joseph proceeded to turn fifes,\nflutes, clarinets, and hautboys; for to his other accomplishments he\njoined that of music, and could play upon the instruments that he made.\nOne of his most ambitious efforts was the making of a pair of\nNorthumberland bagpipes, which he finished to his satisfaction, and\nperformed upon to the great delight of the villagers.  To assist his\nfather in his entomological studies, he even contrived, with the aid of\nthe descriptions given in the books borrowed from his cousin the\nwatchmaker, to make for him a microscope, from which he proceeded to\nmake a reflecting telescope, which proved a very good instrument.  At\nthis early period (1804) he also seems to have directed his attention\nto screw-making--a branch of mechanics in which he afterwards became\nfamous; and he proceeded to make a pair of very satisfactory\ndie-stocks, though it is said that he had not before seen or even heard\nof such a contrivance for making screws.\n\nSo clever a workman was not likely to remain long a village slater.\nAlthough the ingenious pieces of work which he turned out by his lathe\ndid not bring him in much money, he liked the occupation so much better\nthan slating that he was gradually giving up that trade.  His father\nurged him to stick to slating as \"a safe thing;\" but his own mind was\nin favour of following his instinct to be a mechanic; and at length he\ndetermined to leave his village and seek work in a new line.  He\nsucceeded in finding employment in a small factory at Kirby Stephen, a\ntown some thirteen miles from Great Ashby, where he worked at making\npower-looms.  From an old statement of account against his employer\nwhich we have seen, in his own handwriting, dated the 6th September,\n1805, it appears that his earnings at such work as \"fitting the first\nset of iron loames,\" \"fitting up shittles,\" and \"making moddles,\" were\n3s. 6d. a day; and he must, during the same time, have lived with his\nemployer, who charged him as a set-off \"14 weaks bord at 8s. per weak.\"\nHe afterwards seems to have worked at piece-work in partnership with\none Andrew Gamble supplying the materials as well as the workmanship\nfor the looms and shuttles.  His employer, Mr. George Dickinson, also\nseems to have bought his reflecting telescope from him for the sum of\n12L.\n\nFrom Kirby Stephen Clement removed to Carlisle, where he was employed\nby Forster and Sons during the next two years at the same description\nof work; and he conducted himself, according; to their certificate on\nhis leaving their employment to proceed to Glasgow in 1807, \"with great\nsobriety and industry, entirely to their satisfaction.\"  While working\nat Glasgow as a turner, he took lessons in drawing from Peter\nNicholson, the well-known writer on carpentry--a highly ingenious man.\nNicholson happened to call at the shop at which Clement worked in order\nto make a drawing of a power-loom; and Clement's expressions of\nadmiration at his expertness were so enthusiastic, that Nicholson,\npleased with the youth's praise, asked if he could be of service to him\nin any way.  Emboldened by the offer, Clement requested, as the\ngreatest favour he could confer upon him, to have the loan of the\ndrawing he had just made, in order that he might copy it.  The request\nwas at once complied with; and Clement, though very poor at the time,\nand scarcely able to buy candle for the long winter evenings, sat up\nlate every night until he had finished it.  Though the first drawing he\nhad ever made, he handed it back to Nicholson instead of the original,\nand at first the draughtsman did not recognise that the drawing was not\nhis own.  When Clement told him that it was only the copy, Nicholson's\nbrief but emphatic praise was--\"Young man, YOU'LL DO!\"  Proud to have\nsuch a pupil, Nicholson generously offered to give him gratuitous\nlessons in drawing, which were thankfully accepted; and Clement,\nworking at nights with great ardour, soon made rapid progress, and\nbecame an expert draughtsman.\n\nTrade being very slack in Glasgow at the time, Clement, after about a\nyear's stay in the place, accepted a situation with Messrs. Leys,\nMasson, and Co., of Aberdeen, with whom he began at a guinea and a half\na week, from which he gradually rose to two guineas, and ultimately to\nthree guineas.  His principal work consisted in designing and making\npower-looms for his employers, and fitting them up in different parts\nof the country.  He continued to devote himself to the study of\npractical mechanics, and made many improvements in the tools with which\nhe worked.  While at Glasgow he had made an improved pair of die-stocks\nfor screws; and, at Aberdeen, he made a turning-lathe with a sliding\nmandrill and guide-screws, for cutting screws, furnished also with the\nmeans for correcting guide-screws.  In the same machine he introduced a\nsmall slide rest, into which he fixed the tool for cutting the\nscrews,--having never before seen a slide rest, though it is very\nprobable he may have heard of what Maudslay had already done in the\nsame direction.  Clement continued during this period of his life an\nindustrious self-cultivator, occupying most of his spare hours in\nmechanical and landscape drawing, and in various studies.  Among the\npapers left behind him we find a ticket to a course of instruction on\nNatural Philosophy given by Professor Copland in the Marischal College\nat Aberdeen, which Clement attended in the session of 1812-13; and we\ndo not doubt that our mechanic was among the most diligent of his\npupils.  Towards the end of 1813, after saving about 100L. out of his\nwages, Clement resolved to proceed to London for the purpose of\nimproving himself in his trade and pushing his way in the world.  The\ncoach by which he travelled set him down in Snow Hill, Holborn; and his\nfirst thought was of finding work.  He had no friend in town to consult\non the matter, so he made inquiry of the coach-guard whether he knew of\nany person in the mechanical line in that neighbourhood.  The guard\nsaid, \"Yes; there was Alexander Galloway's show shop, just round the\ncorner, and he employed a large number of hands.\"  Running round the\ncorner, Clement looked in at Galloway's window, through which he saw\nsome lathes and other articles used in machine shops.  Next morning he\ncalled upon the owner of the shop to ask employment.  \"What can you\ndo?\" asked Galloway.  \"I can work at the forge,\" said Clement.\n\"Anything else?\"  \"I can turn.\"  \"What else?\"  \"I can draw.\"  \"What!\"\nsaid Galloway, \"can you draw? Then I will engage you.\"  A man who could\ndraw or work to a drawing in those days was regarded as a superior sort\nof mechanic.  Though Galloway was one of the leading tradesmen of his\ntime, and had excellent opportunities for advancement, he missed them\nall.  As Clement afterwards said of him, \"He was only a mouthing\ncommon-council man, the height of whose ambition was to be an\nalderman;\" and, like most corporation celebrities, he held a low rank\nin his own business.  He very rarely went into his workshops to\nsuperintend or direct his workmen, leaving this to his foremen--a\nsufficient indication of the causes of his failure as a mechanic.[1]\n\nOn entering Galloway's shop, Clement was first employed in working at\nthe lathe; but finding the tools so bad that it was impossible to\nexecute satisfactory work with them, he at once went to the forge, and\nbegan making a new set of tools for himself.  The other men, to whom\nsuch a proceeding was entirely new, came round him to observe his\noperations, and they were much struck with his manual dexterity.  The\ntools made, he proceeded to use them, displaying what seemed to the\nother workmen an unusual degree of energy and intelligence; and some of\nthe old hands did not hesitate already to pronounce Clement to be the\nbest mechanic in the shop.  When Saturday night came round, the other\nmen were curious to know what wages Galloway would allow the new hand;\nand when he had been paid, they asked him.  \"A guinea,\" was the reply.\n\"A guinea!  Why, you are worth two if you are worth a shilling,\" said\nan old man who came out of the rank--an excellent mechanic, who, though\ncomparatively worthless through his devotion to drink, knew Clement's\nmoney value to his employer better than any man there; and he added,\n\"Wait for a week or two, and if you are not better paid than this, I\ncan tell you of a master who will give you a fairer wage.\"  Several\nSaturdays came round, but no advance was made on the guinea a week; and\nthen the old workman recommended Clement to offer himself to Bramah at\nPimlico, who was always on the look out for first-rate mechanics.\n\nClement acted on the advice, and took with him some of his drawings, at\nsight of which Bramah immediately engaged him for a month; and at the\nend of that time he had given so much satisfaction, that it was agreed\nhe should continue for three months longer at two guineas a week.\nClement was placed in charge of the tools of the shop, and he showed\nhimself so apt at introducing improvements in them, as well as in\norganizing the work with a view to despatch and economy, that at the\nend of the term Bramah made him a handsome present, adding, \"if I had\nsecured your services five years since, I would now have been a richer\nman by many thousands of pounds.\"  A formal agreement for a term of\nfive years was then entered into between Bramah and Clement, dated the\n1st of April, 1814, by which the latter undertook to fill the office of\nchief-draughtsman and superintendent of the Pimlico Works, in\nconsideration of a salary of three guineas a week, with an advance of\nfour shillings a week in each succeeding year of the engagement.  This\narrangement proved of mutual advantage to both.  Clement devoted\nhimself with increased zeal to the improvement of the mechanical\narrangements of the concern, exhibiting his ingenuity in many ways, and\ntaking; a genuine pride in upholding the character of his master for\nturning out first-class work.\n\nOn the death of Bramah, his sons returned from college and entered into\npossession of the business.  They found Clement the ruling mind there\nand grew jealous of him to such an extent that his situation became\nuncomfortable; and by mutual consent he was allowed to leave before the\nexpiry of his term of agreement.  He had no difficulty in finding\nemployment; and was at once taken on as chief draughtsman at Maudslay\nand Field's where he was of much assistance in proportioning the early\nmarine engines, for the manufacture of which that firm were becoming\ncelebrated.  After a short time, he became desirous of beginning\nbusiness on his own account as a mechanical engineer.  He was\nencouraged to do this by the Duke of Northumberland, who, being a great\nlover of mechanics and himself a capital turner, used often to visit\nMaudslay's, and thus became acquainted with Clement, whose expertness\nas a draughtsman and mechanic he greatly admired.  Being a man of\nfrugal and sober habits, always keeping his expenditure very\nconsiderably within his income, Clement had been enabled to accumulate\nabout 500L., which he thought would be enough for his purpose; and he\naccordingly proceeded, in 1817, to take a small workshop in Prospect\nPlace, Newington Butts, where he began business as a mechanical\ndraughtsman and manufacturer of small machinery requiring first-class\nworkmanship.\n\nFrom the time when he took his first gratuitous lessons in drawing from\nPeter Nicholson, at Glasgow, in 1807, he had been steadily improving in\nthis art, the knowledge of which is indispensable to whoever aspires to\neminence as a mechanical engineer,--until by general consent Clement\nwas confessed to stand unrivalled as a draughtsman.  Some of the very\nbest drawings contained in the Transactions of the Society of Arts,\nfrom the year 1817 downwards,--especially those requiring the\ndelineation of any unusually elaborate piece of machinery,--proceeded\nfrom the hand of Clement.  In some of these, he reached a degree of\ntruth in mechanical perspective which has never been surpassed.[2]  To\nfacilitate his labours, he invented an extremely ingenious instrument,\nby means of which ellipses of all proportions, as well as circles and\nright lines, might be geometrically drawn on paper or on copper.  He\ntook his idea of this instrument from the trammel used by carpenters\nfor drawing imperfect ellipses; and when he had succeeded in avoiding\nthe crossing of the points, he proceeded to invent the straight-line\nmotion.  For this invention the Society of Arts awarded him their gold\nmedal in 1818.  Some years later, he submitted to the same Society his\ninvention of a stand for drawings of large size.  He had experienced\nconsiderable difficulty in making such drawings, and with his\naccustomed readiness to overcome obstacles, he forthwith set to work\nand brought out his new drawing-table.\n\nAs with many other original-minded mechanics, invention became a habit\nwith him, and by study and labour he rarely failed in attaining the\nobject which he had bent his mind upon accomplishing.  Indeed, nothing\npleased him better than to have what he called \"a tough job;\" as it\nstimulated his inventive faculty, in the exercise of which he took the\nhighest pleasure.  Hence mechanical schemers of all kinds were\naccustomed to resort to Clement for help when they had found an idea\nwhich they desired to embody in a machine.  If there was any value in\ntheir idea, none could be more ready than he to recognise its merit,\nand to work it into shape; but if worthless, he spoke out his mind at\nonce, dissuading the projector from wasting upon it further labour or\nexpense.\n\nOne of the important branches of practical mechanics to which Clement\ncontinued through life to devote himself, was the improvement of\nself-acting tools, more especially of the slide-lathe.  He introduced\nvarious improvements in its construction and arrangement, until in his\nhands it became as nearly perfect as it was possible to be.  In 1818,\nhe furnished the lathe with a slide rest twenty-two inches long, for\nthe purpose of cutting screws, provided with the means of\nself-correction; and some years later, in 1827, the Society of Arts\nawarded him their gold Isis medal for his improved turning-lathe, which\nembodied many ingenious contrivances calculated to increase its\nprecision and accuracy in large surface-turning.\n\nThe beautiful arrangements embodied in Mr. Clement's improved lathe can\nwith difficulty be described in words; but its ingenuity may be\ninferred from a brief statement of the defects which it was invented to\nremedy, and which it successfully overcame.  When the mandrill of a\nlathe, having a metal plate fixed to it, turns round with a uniform\nmotion, and the slide rest which carries the cutter is moving from the\ncircumference of the work to the centre, it will be obvious that the\nquantity of metal passing over the edge of the cutter at each\nrevolution, and therefore at equal intervals of time, is continually\ndiminishing, in exact proportion to the spiral line described by the\ncutter on the face of the work.  But in turning metal plates it is\nfound very in expedient to increase the speed of the work beyond a\ncertain quantity; for when this happens, and the tool passes the work\nat too great a velocity, it heats, softens, and is ground away, the\nedge of the cutter becomes dull, and the surface of the plate is\nindented and burnished, instead of being turned.  Hence loss of time on\nthe part of the workman, and diminished work on the part of the tool,\nresults which, considering the wages of the one and the capital\nexpended on the construction of the other, are of no small importance;\nfor the prime objects of all improvement of tools are, economy of time\nand economy of capital--to minimize labour and cost, and maximize\nresult.\n\nThe defect to which we have referred was almost the only remaining\nimperfection in the lathe, and Mr. Clement overcame it by making the\nmachine self-regulating; so that, whatever might be the situation of\nthe cutter, equal quantities of metal should pass over it in equal\ntimes,--the speed at the centre not exceeding that suited to the work\nat the circumference,--while the workman was enabled to convert the\nvarying rate of the mandrill into a uniform one whenever he chose.\nThus the expedients of wheels, riggers, and drums, of different\ndiameters, by which it had been endeavoured to alter the speed of the\nlathe-mandrill, according to the hardness of the metal and the diameter\nof the thing to be turned, were effectually disposed of.  These, though\nanswering very well where cylinders of equal diameter had to be bored,\nand a uniform motion was all that was required, were found very\ninefficient where a Plane surface had to be turned; and it was in such\ncases that Mr. Clement's lathe was found so valuable.  By its means\nsurfaces of unrivalled correctness were produced, and the slide-lathe,\nso improved, became recognised and adopted as the most accurate and\nextensively applicable of all machine-tools.\n\nThe year after Mr. Clement brought out his improved turning-lathe, he\nadded to it his self-adjusting double driving centre-chuck, for which\nthe Society of Arts awarded him their silver medal in 1828.  In\nintroducing this invention to the notice of the Society, Mr. Clement\nsaid, \"Although I have been in the habit of turning and making\nturning-lathes and other machinery for upwards of thirty-five years,\nand have examined the best turning-lathes in the principal\nmanufactories throughout Great Britain, I find it universally regretted\nby all practical men that they cannot turn anything perfectly true\nbetween the centres of the lathe.\"  It was found by experience, that\nthere was a degree of eccentricity, and consequently of imperfection,\nin the figure of any long cylinder turned while suspended between the\ncentres of the lathe, and made to revolve by the action of a single\ndriver.  Under such circumstances the pressure of the tool tended to\nforce the work out of the right line and to distribute the strain\nbetween the driver and the adjacent centre, so that one end of the\ncylinder became eccentric with respect to the other.  By Mr. Clement's\ninvention of the two-armed driver, which was self-adjusting, the strain\nwas taken from the centre and divided between the two arms, which being\nequidistant from the centre, effectually corrected all eccentricity in\nthe work.  This invention was found of great importance in ensuring the\ntrue turning of large machinery, which before had been found a matter\nof considerable difficulty.\n\nIn the same year (1828) Mr. Clement began the making of fluted taps and\ndies, and he established a mechanical practice with reference to the\npitch of the screw, which proved of the greatest importance in the\neconomics of manufacture.  Before his time, each mechanical engineer\nadopted a thread of his own; so that when a piece of work came under\nrepair, the screw-hob had usually to be drilled out, and a new thread\nwas introduced according to the usage which prevailed in the shop in\nwhich the work was executed.  Mr. Clement saw a great waste of labour\nin this practice, and he promulgated the idea that every screw of a\nparticular length ought to be furnished with its appointed number of\nthreads of a settled pitch.  Taking the inch as the basis of his\ncalculations, he determined the number of threads in each case; and the\npractice thus initiated by him, recommended as it was by convenience\nand economy, was very shortly adopted throughout the trade.  It may be\nmentioned that one of Clement's ablest journeymen, Mr. Whitworth, has,\nsince his time, been mainly instrumental in establishing the settled\npractice; and Whitworth's thread (initiated by Clement) has become\nrecognised throughout the mechanical world.  To carry out his idea,\nClement invented his screw-engine lathe, with gearing, mandrill, and\nsliding-table wheel-work, by means of which he first cut the inside\nscrew-tools from the left-handed hobs--the reverse mode having before\nbeen adopted,--while in shaping machines he was the first to use the\nrevolving cutter attached to the slide rest.  Then, in 1828, he fluted\nthe taps for the first time with a revolving cutter,--other makers\nhaving up to that time only notched them.  Among his other inventions\nin screws may be mentioned his headless tap, which, according to Mr.\nNasmyth, is so valuable an invention, that, \"if he had done nothing\nelse, it ought to immortalize him among mechanics.  It passed right\nthrough the hole to be tapped, and was thus enabled to do the duty of\nthree ordinary screws.\"  By these improvements much greater precision\nwas secured in the manufacture of tools and machinery, accompanied by a\ngreatly reduced cost of production; the results of which are felt to\nthis day.\n\nAnother of Mr. Clement's ingenious inventions was his Planing Machine,\nby means of which metal plates of large dimensions were planed with\nperfect truth and finished with beautiful accuracy.  There is perhaps\nscarcely a machine about which there has been more controversy than\nthis; and we do not pretend to be able to determine the respective\nmerits of the many able mechanics who have had a hand in its invention.\nIt is exceedingly probable that others besides Clement worked out the\nproblem in their own way, by independent methods; and this is confirmed\nby the circumstance that though the results achieved by the respective\ninventors were the same, the methods employed by them were in many\nrespects different.  As regards Clement, we find that previous to the\nyear 1820 he had a machine in regular use for planing the triangular\nbars of lathes and the sides of weaving-looms.  This instrument was\nfound so useful and so economical in its working, that Clement\nproceeded to elaborate a planing machine of a more complete kind, which\nhe finished and set to work in the year 1825.  He prepared no model of\nit, but made it direct from the working drawings; and it was so nicely\nconstructed, that when put together it went without a hitch, and has\ncontinued steadily working for more than thirty years down to the\npresent day.\n\nClement took out no patent for his invention, relying for protection\nmainly on his own and his workmen's skill in using it.  We therefore\nfind no specification of his machine at the Patent Office, as in the\ncase of most other capital inventions; but a very complete account of\nit is to be found in the Transactions of the Society of Arts for 1832,\nas described by Mr. Varley.  The practical value of the Planing Machine\ninduced the Society to apply to Mr. Clement for liberty to publish a\nfull description of it; and Mr. Varley's paper was the result.[3]  It\nmay be briefly stated that this engineer's plane differs greatly from\nthe carpenter's plane, the cutter of which is only allowed to project\nso far as to admit of a thin shaving to be sliced off,--the plane\nworking flat in proportion to the width of the tool, and its length and\nstraightness preventing the cutter from descending into any hollows in\nthe wood.  The engineer's plane more resembles the turning-lathe, of\nwhich indeed it is but a modification, working up on the same\nprinciple, on flat surfaces.  The tools or cutters in Clement's machine\nwere similar to those used in the lathe, varying in like manner, but\nperforming their work in right lines,--the tool being stationary and\nthe work moving under it, the tool only travelling when making lateral\ncuts.  To save time two cutters were mounted, one to cut the work while\ngoing, the other while returning, both being so arranged and held as to\nbe presented to the work in the firmest manner, and with the least\npossible friction.  The bed of the machine, on which the work was laid,\npassed under the cutters on perfectly true rollers or wheels, lodged\nand held in their bearings as accurately as the best mandrill could be,\nand having set-screws acting against their ends totally preventing all\nend-motion.  The machine was bedded on a massive and solid foundation\nof masonry in heavy blocks, the support at all points being so complete\nas effectually to destroy all tendency to vibration, with the object of\nsecuring full, round, and quiet cuts.  The rollers on which the\nplaning-machine travelled were so true, that Clement himself used to\nsay of them, \"If you were to put but a paper shaving under one of the\nrollers, it would at once stop all the rest.\"  Nor was this any\nexaggeration--the entire mechanism, notwithstanding its great size,\nbeing as true and accurate as that of a watch.\n\nBy an ingenious adaptation of the apparatus, which will also be found\ndescribed in the Society of Arts paper, the planing machine might be\nfitted with a lathe-bed, either to hold two centres, or a head with a\nsuitable mandrill.  When so fitted, the machine was enabled to do the\nwork of a turning-lathe, though in a different way, cutting cylinders\nor cones in their longitudinal direction perfectly straight, as well as\nsolids or prisms of any angle, either by the longitudinal or lateral\nmotion of the cutter; whilst by making the work revolve, it might be\nturned as in any other lathe.  This ingenious machine, as contrived by\nMr. Clement, therefore represented a complete union of the\nturning-lathe with the planing machine and dividing engine, by which\nturning of the most complicated kind might readily be executed.  For\nten years after it was set in motion, Clement's was the only machine of\nthe sort available for planing large work; and being consequently very\nmuch in request, it was often kept going night and day,--the earnings\nby the planing machine alone during that time forming the principal\nincome of its inventor.  As it took in a piece of work six feet square,\nand as his charge for planing was three-halfpence the square inch, or\neighteen shillings the square foot, he could thus earn by his machine\nalone some ten pounds for every day's work of twelve hours.  We may add\nthat since planing machines in various forms have become common in\nmechanical workshops, the cost of planing does not amount to more than\nthree-halfpence the square foot.\n\nThe excellence of Mr. Clement's tools, and his well-known skill in\ndesigning and executing work requiring unusual accuracy and finish, led\nto his being employed by Mr. Babbage to make his celebrated Calculating\nor Difference Engine.  The contrivance of a machine that should work\nout complicated sums in arithmetic with perfect precision, was, as may\nreadily be imagined, one of the most difficult feats of the mechanical\nintellect.  To do this was in an especial sense to stamp matter with\nthe impress of mind, and render it subservient to the highest thinking\nfaculty.  Attempts had been made at an early period to perform\narithmetical calculations by mechanical aids more rapidly and precisely\nthan it was possible to do by the operations of the individual mind.\nThe preparation of arithmetical tables of high numbers involved a vast\ndeal of labour, and even with the greatest care errors were unavoidable\nand numerous.  Thus in a multipltcation-table prepared by a man so\neminent as Dr. Hutton for the Board of Longitude, no fewer than forty\nerrors were discovered in a single page taken at random.  In the tables\nof the Nautical Almanac, where the greatest possible precision was\ndesirable and necessary, more than five hundred errors were detected by\none person; and the Tables of the Board of Longitude were found equally\nincorrect.  But such errors were impossible to be avoided so long as\nthe ordinary modes of calculating, transcribing, and printing continued\nin use.\n\nThe earliest and simplest form of calculating apparatus was that\nemployed by the schoolboys of ancient Greece, called the Abacus;\nconsisting of a smooth board with a narrow rim, on which they were\ntaught to compute by means of progressive rows of pebbles, bits of bone\nor ivory, or pieces of silver coin, used as counters.  The same board,\nstrewn over with sand, was used for teaching the rudiments of writing\nand the principles of geometry.  The Romans subsequently adopted the\nAbacus, dividing it by means of perpendicular lines or bars, and from\nthe designation of calculus which they gave to each pebble or counter\nemployed on the board, we have derived our English word to calculate.\nThe same instrument continued to be employed during the middle ages,\nand the table used by the English Court of Exchequer was but a modified\nform of the Greek Abacus, the chequered lines across it giving the\ndesignation to the Court, which still survives.  Tallies, from the\nFrench word tailler to cut, were another of the mechanical methods\nemployed to record computations, though in a very rude way.  Step by\nstep improvements were made; the most important being that invented by\nNapier of Merchiston, the inventor of logarithms, commonly called\nNapier's bones, consisting of a number of rods divided into ten equal\nsquares and numbered, so that the whole when placed together formed the\ncommon multiplication table.  By these means various operations in\nmultiplication and division were performed.  Sir Samuel Morland,\nGunter, and Lamb introduced other contrivances, applicable to\ntrigonometry; Gunter's scale being still in common use.  The\ncalculating machines of Gersten and Pascal were of a different kind,\nworking out arithmetical calculations by means of trains of wheels and\nother arrangements; and that contrived by Lord Stanhope for the purpose\nof verifying his calculations with respect to the National Debt was of\nlike character.  But none of these will bear for a moment to be\ncompared with the machine designed by Mr. Babbage for performing\narithmetical calculations and mathematical analyses, as well as for\nrecording the calculations when made, thereby getting rid entirely of\nindividual error in the operations of calculation, transcription, and\nprinting.\n\nThe French government, in their desire to promote the extension of the\ndecimal system, had ordered the construction of logarithmical tables of\nvast extent; but the great labour and expense involved in the\nundertaking prevented the design from being carried out.  It was\nreserved for Mr. Babbage to develope the idea by means of a machine\nwhich he called the Difference Engine.  This machine is of so\ncomplicated a character that it would be impossible for us to give any\nintelligible description of it in words.  Although Dr. Lardner was\nunrivalled in the art of describing mechanism, he occupied twenty-five\npages of the 'Edinburgh Review' (vol.59) in endeavouring to describe\nits action, and there were several features in it which he gave up as\nhopeless.  Some parts of the apparatus and modes of action are indeed\nextraordinary and perhaps none more so than that for ensuring accuracy\nin the calculated results,--the machine actually correcting itself, and\nrubbing itself back into accuracy, when the disposition to err occurs,\nby the friction of the adjacent machinery!  When an error is made, the\nwheels become locked and refuse to proceed; thus the machine must go\nrightly or not at all,--an arrangement as nearly resembling volition as\nanything that brass and steel are likely to accomplish.\n\nThis intricate subject was taken up by Mr. Babbage in 1821, when he\nundertook to superintend for the British government the construction of\na machine for calculating and printing mathematical and astronomical\ntables.  The model first constructed to illustrate the nature of his\ninvention produced figures at the rate of 44 a minute.  In 1823 the\nRoyal Society was requested to report upon the invention, and after\nfull inquiry the committee recommended it as one highly deserving of\npublic encouragement.  A sum of 1500L. was then placed at Mr. Babbage's\ndisposal by the Lords of the Treasury for the purpose of enabling him\nto perfect his invention.  It was at this time that he engaged Mr.\nClement as draughtsman and mechanic to embody his ideas in a working\nmachine.  Numerous tools were expressly contrived by the latter for\nexecuting the several parts, and workmen were specially educated for\nthe purpose of using them.  Some idea of the elaborate character of the\ndrawings may be formed from the fact that those required for the\ncalculating machinery alone--not to mention the printing machinery,\nwhich was almost equally elaborate--covered not less than four hundred\nsquare feet of surface!  The cost of executing the calculating machine\nwas of course very great, and the progress of the work was necessarily\nslow.  The consequence was that the government first became impatient,\nand then began to grumble at the expense.  At the end of seven years\nthe engineer's bills alone were found to amount to nearly 7200L., and\nMr. Babbage's costs out of pocket to 7000L. more.  In order to make\nmore satisfactory progress, it was determined to remove the works to\nthe neighbourhood of Mr. Babbage's own residence; but as Clement's\nclaims for conducting the operations in the new premises were thought\nexorbitant, and as he himself considered that the work did not yield\nhim the average profit of ordinary employment in his own trade, he\neventually withdrew from the enterprise, taking with him the tools\nwhich he had constructed for executing the machine.  The government\nalso shortly after withdrew from it, and from that time the scheme was\nsuspended, the Calculating Engine remaining a beautiful but unfinished\nfragment of a great work.  Though originally intended to go as far as\ntwenty figures, it was only completed to the extent of being capable of\ncalculating to the depth of five figures, and two orders of\ndifferences; and only a small part of the proposed printing machinery\nwas ever made.  The engine was placed in the museum of King's College\nin 1843, enclosed in a glass case, until the year 1862, when it was\nremoved for a time to the Great Exhibition, where it formed perhaps the\nmost remarkable and beautifully executed piece of mechanism the\ncombined result of intellectual and mechanical contrivance--in the\nentire collection.[4]\n\nClement was on various other occasions invited to undertake work\nrequiring extra skill, which other mechanics were unwilling or unable\nto execute.  He was thus always full of employment, never being under\nthe necessity of canvassing for customers.  He was almost constantly in\nhis workshop, in which he took great pride.  His dwelling was over the\noffice in the yard, and it was with difficulty he could be induced to\nleave the premises.  On one occasion Mr. Brunel of the Great Western\nRailway called upon him to ask if he could supply him with a superior\nsteam-whistle for his locomotives, the whistles which they were using\ngiving forth very little sound.  Clement examined the specimen brought\nby Brunel, and pronounced it to be \"mere tallow-chandler's work.\"  He\nundertook to supply a proper article, and after his usual fashion he\nproceeded to contrive a machine or tool for the express purpose of\nmaking steam-whistles.  They were made and supplied, and when mounted\non the locomotive the effect was indeed \"screaming.\"  They were heard\nmiles off, and Brunel, delighted, ordered a hundred.  But when the bill\ncame in, it was found that the charge made for them was very high--as\nmuch as 40L. the set.  The company demurred at the price,--Brunel\ndeclaring it to be six times more than the price they had before been\npaying.  \"That may be;\" rejoined Clement, \"but mine are more than six\ntimes better.  You ordered a first-rate article, and you must be\ncontent to pay for it.\" The matter was referred to an arbitrator, who\nawarded the full sum claimed.  Mr. Weld mentions a similar case of an\norder which Clement received from America to make a large screw of\ngiven dimensions \"in the best possible manner,\" and he accordingly\nproceeded to make one with the greatest mathematical accuracy.  But his\nbill amounted to some hundreds of pounds, which completely staggered\nthe American, who did not calculate on having to pay more than 20L. at\nthe utmost for the screw.  The matter was, however, referred to\narbitrators, who gave their decision, as in the former case, in favour\nof the mechanic.[5]\n\nOne of the last works which Clement executed as a matter of pleasure,\nwas the building of an organ for his own use.  It will be remembered\nthat when working as a slater at Great Ashby, he had made flutes and\nclarinets, and now in his old age he determined to try his skill at\nmaking an organ--in his opinion the king of musical instruments.  The\nbuilding of it became his hobby, and his greatest delight was in\nsuperintending its progress.  It cost him about two thousand pounds in\nlabour alone, but he lived to finish it, and we have been informed that\nit was pronounced a very excellent instrument.\n\nClement was a heavy-browed man, without any polish of manner or speech;\nfor to the last he continued to use his strong Westmoreland dialect.\nHe was not educated in a literary sense; for he read but little, and\ncould write with difficulty.  He was eminently a mechanic, and had\nachieved his exquisite skill by observation, experience, and\nreflection.  His head was a complete repertory of inventions, on which\nhe was constantly drawing for the improvement of mechanical practice.\nThough he had never more than thirty workmen in his factory, they were\nall of the first class; and the example which Clement set before them\nof extreme carefulness and accuracy in execution rendered his shop one\nof the best schools of its time for the training of thoroughly\naccomplished mechanics.  Mr. Clement died in 1844, in his sixty-fifth\nyear; after which his works were carried on by Mr. Wilkinson, one of\nhis nephews; and his planing machine still continues in useful work.\n\n\n\n[1] On one occasion Galloway had a cast-iron roof made for his\nworkshop, so flat and so independent of ties that the wonder was that\nit should have stood an hour.  One day Peter Keir, an engineer much\nemployed by the government--a clever man, though some what\neccentric--was taken into the shop by Galloway to admire the new roof.\nKeir, on glancing up at it, immediately exclaimed, \"Come outside, and\nlet us speak about it there!\"  All that he could say to Galloway\nrespecting the unsoundness of its construction was of no avail.  The\nfact was that, however Keir might argue about its not being able to\nstand, there it was actually standing, and that was enough for\nGalloway.  Keir went home, his mind filled with Galloway's most\nunprincipled roof.  \"If that stands,\" said he to himself, \"all that I\nhave been learning and doing for thirty years has been wrong.\"  That\nnight he could not sleep for thinking about it.  In the morning he\nstrolled up Primrose Hill, and returned home still muttering to himself\nabout \"that roof.\"  \"What,\" said his wife to him, \"are you thinking of\nGalloway's roof?\"  \"Yes,\" said he.  \"Then you have seen the papers?\"\n\"No--what about them?\"  \"Galloway's roof has fallen in this morning,\nand killed eight or ten of the men!\" Keir immediately went to bed, and\nslept soundly till next morning.\n\n[2] See more particularly The Transactions of the Society for the\nEncouragement of Arts, vol. xxxiii.

A\nhistory of the machine, and of the circumstances connected with its\nconstruction, will also be found in Weld's History of the Royal\nSociety, vol. ii. 369-391.  It remains to be added, that the perusal by\nMessrs. Scheutz of Stockholm of Dr. Lardner's account of Mr. Babbage's\nengine in the Edinburgh Review, led those clever mechanics to enter\nupon the scheme of constructing and completing it, and the result is,\nthat their machine not only calculates the tables, but prints the\nresults.  It took them nearly twenty years to perfect it, but when\ncompleted the machine seemed to be almost capable of thinking.  The\noriginal was exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1855.  A copy of it\nhas since been secured by the English government at a cost of 1200L.,\nand it is now busily employed at Somerset House in working out annuity\nand other tables for the Registrar-General.  The copy was constructed,\nwith several admirable improvements, by the Messrs. Donkin, the\nwell-known mechanical engineers, after the working drawings of the\nMessrs.

Among these may be mentioned James Fox\nof Derby; Matthew Murray and Peter Fairbairn of Leeds; Richard Roberts,\nJoseph Whitworth, James Nasmyth, and William Fairbairn of Manchester;\nto all of whom the manufacturing industry of Great Britain stands in\nthe highest degree indebted.\n\nJames Fox, the founder of the Derby firm of mechanical engineers, was\noriginally a butler in the service of the Rev. Thomas Gisborne, of\nFoxhall Lodge, Staffordshire.  Though a situation of this kind might\nnot seem by any means favourable for the display of mechanical ability,\nyet the butler's instinct for handicraft was so strong that it could\nnot be repressed; and his master not only encouraged him in the\nhandling of tools in his leisure hours, but had so genuine an\nadmiration of his skill as well as his excellent qualities of\ncharacter, that he eventually furnished him with the means of beginning\nbusiness on his own account.\n\nThe growth and extension of the cotton, silk, and lace trades, in the\nneighbourhood of Derby, furnished Fox with sufficient opportunities for\nthe exercise of his mechanical skill; and he soon found ample scope for\nits employment.  His lace machinery became celebrated, and he supplied\nit largely to the neighbouring town of Nottingham; he also obtained\nconsiderable employment from the great firms of Arkwright and\nStrutt--the founders of the modern cotton manufacture.  Mr. Fox also\nbecame celebrated for his lathes, which were of excellent quality,\nstill maintaining their high reputation; and besides making largely for\nthe supply of the home demand, he exported much machinery abroad, to\nFrance, Russia, and the Mauritius.\n\nThe present Messrs. Fox of Derby, who continue to carry on the business\nof the firm, claim for their grandfather, its founder, that he made the\nfirst planing machine in 1814,[1] and they add that the original\narticle continued in use until quite recently.  We have been furnished\nby Samuel Hall, formerly a workman at the Messrs. Fox's, with the\nfollowing description of the machine:--\"It was essentially the same in\nprinciple as the planing machine now in general use, although differing\nin detail.  It had a self-acting ratchet motion for moving the slides\nof a compound slide rest, and a self-acting reversing tackle,\nconsisting of three bevel wheels, one a stud, one loose on the driving\nshaft, and another on a socket, with a pinion on the opposite end of\nthe driving shaft running on the socket.  The other end was the place\nfor the driving pulley.  A clutch box was placed between the two\nopposite wheels, which was made to slide on a feather, so that by means\nof another shaft containing levers and a tumbling ball, the box on\nreversing was carried from one bevel wheel to the opposite one.\"  The\nsame James Fox is also said at a very early period to have invented a\nscrew-cutting machine, an engine for accurately dividing and cutting\nthe teeth of wheels, and a self-acting lathe.  But the evidence as to\nthe dates at which these several inventions are said to have been made\nis so conflicting that it is impossible to decide with whom the merit\nof making them really rests.  The same idea is found floating at the\nsame time in many minds, the like necessity pressing upon all, and the\nprocess of invention takes place in like manner:  hence the\ncontemporaneousness of so many inventions, and the disputes that arise\nrespecting them, as described in a previous chapter.\n\nThere are still other claimants for the merit of having invented the\nplaning machine; among whom may be mentioned more particularly Matthew\nMurray of Leeds, and Richard Roberts of Manchester.  We are informed by\nMr. March, the present mayor of Leeds, head of the celebrated\ntool-manufacturing firm of that town, that when he first went to work\nat Matthew Murray's, in 1814, a planing machine of his invention was\nused to plane the circular part or back of the D valve, which he had by\nthat time introduced in the steam-engine.  Mr. March says, \"I recollect\nit very distinctly, and even the sort of framing on which it stood.\nThe machine was not patented, and like many inventions in those days,\nit was kept as much a secret as possible, being locked up in a small\nroom by itself, to which the ordinary workmen could not obtain access.\nThe year in which I remember it being in use was, so far as I am aware,\nlong before any planing-machine of a similar kind had been invented.\"\n\nMatthew Murray was born at Stockton-on-Tees in the year 1763.  His\nparents were of the working class, and Matthew, like the other members\nof the family, was brought up with the ordinary career of labour before\nhim.  When of due age his father apprenticed him to the trade of a\nblacksmith, in which he very soon acquired considerable expertness.  He\nmarried before his term had expired; after which, trade being slack at\nStockton, he found it necessary to look for work elsewhere.  Leaving\nhis wife behind him, he set out for Leeds with his bundle on his back,\nand after a long journey on foot, he reached that town with not enough\nmoney left in his pocket to pay for a bed at the Bay Horse inn, where\nhe put up.  But telling the landlord that he expected work at\nMarshall's, and seeming to be a respectable young man, the landlord\ntrusted him; and he was so fortunate as to obtain the job which he\nsought at Mr. Marshall's, who was then beginning the manufacture of\nflax, for which the firm has since become so famous.\n\nMr. Marshall was at that time engaged in improving the method of\nmanufacture,[2] and the young blacksmith was so fortunate or rather so\ndexterous as to be able to suggest several improvements in the\nmachinery which secured the approval of his employer, who made him a\npresent of 20L., and very shortly promoted him to be the first mechanic\nin the workshop.  On this stroke of good fortune Murray took a house at\nthe neighbouring village of Beeston, sent to Stockton for his wife, who\nspeedily joined him, and he now felt himself fairly started in the\nworld.  He remained with Mr. Marshall for about twelve years, during\nwhich he introduced numerous improvements in the machinery for spinning\nflax, and obtained the reputation of being a first-rate mechanic.  This\ninduced Mr. James Fenton and Mr. David Wood to offer to join him in the\nestablishment of an engineering and machine-making factory at Leeds;\nwhich he agreed to, and operations were commenced at Holbeck in the\nyear 1795.\n\nAs Mr. Murray had obtained considerable practical knowledge of the\nsteam-engine while working at Mr. Marshall's, he took principal charge\nof the engine-building department, while his partner Wood directed the\nmachine-making.  In the branch of engine-building Mr. Murray very\nshortly established a high reputation, treading close upon the heels of\nBoulton and Watt--so close, indeed, that that firm became very jealous\nof him, and purchased a large piece of ground close to his works with\nthe object of preventing their extension.[3]  His additions to the\nsteam-engine were of great practical value, one of which, the\nself-acting apparatus attached to the boiler for the purpose of\nregulating the intensity of fire under it, and consequently the\nproduction of steam, is still in general use.  This was invented by him\nas early as 1799.  He also subsequently invented the D slide valve, or\nat least greatly improved it, while he added to the power of the\nair-pump, and gave a new arrangement to the other parts, with a view to\nthe simplification of the powers of the engine.  To make the D valve\nwork efficiently, it was found necessary to form two perfectly plane\nsurfaces, to produce which he invented his planing machine.  He was\nalso the first to adopt the practice of placing the piston in a\nhorizontal position in the common condensing engine.  Among his other\nmodifications in the steam-engine, was his improvement of the\nlocomotive as invented by Trevithick; and it ought to be remembered to\nhis honour that he made the first locomotive that regularly worked upon\nany railway.\n\nThis was the engine erected by him for Blenkinsop, to work the\nMiddleton colliery railway near Leeds, on which it began to run in\n1812, and continued in regular use for many years.  In this engine he\nintroduced the double cylinder--Trevithick's engine being provided with\nonly one cylinder, the defects of which were supplemented by the\naddition of a fly-wheel to carry the crank over the dead points.\n\nBut Matthew Murray's most important inventions, considered in their\neffects on manufacturing industry, were those connected with the\nmachinery for heckling and spinning flax, which he very greatly\nimproved.  His heckling machine obtained for him the prize of the gold\nmedal of the Society of Arts; and this as well as his machine for wet\nflax-spinning by means of sponge weights proved of the greatest\npractical value.  At the time when these inventions were made the flax\ntrade was on the point of expiring, the spinners being unable to\nproduce yarn to a profit; and their almost immediate effect was to\nreduce the cost of production, to improve immensely the quality of the\nmanufacture, and to establish the British linen trade on a solid\nfoundation.  The production of flax-machinery became an important\nbranch of manufacture at Leeds, large quantities being made for use at\nhome as well as for exportation, giving employment to an increasing\nnumber of highly skilled mechanics.[4]  Mr. Murray's faculty for\norganising work, perfected by experience, enabled him also to introduce\nmany valuable improvements in the mechanics of manufacturing.  His\npre-eminent skill in mill-gearing became generally acknowledged, and\nthe effects of his labours are felt to this day in the extensive and\nstill thriving branches of industry which his ingenuity and ability\nmainly contributed to establish.  All the machine tools used in his\nestablishment were designed by himself, and he was most careful in the\npersonal superintendence of all the details of their construction.  Mr.\nMurray died at Leeds in 1826, in his sixty-third year.\n\nWe have not yet exhausted the list of claimants to the invention of the\nPlaning Machine, for we find still another in the person of Richard\nRoberts of Manchester, one of the most prolific of modern inventors.\nMr. Roberts has indeed achieved so many undisputed inventions, that he\ncan readily afford to divide the honour in this case with others.  He\nhas contrived things so various as the self-acting mule and the best\nelectro-magnet, wet gas-meters and dry planing machines, iron\nbillard-tables and turret-clocks, the centrifugal railway and the drill\nslotting-machine, an apparatus for making cigars and machinery for the\npropulsion and equipment of steamships; so that he may almost be\nregarded as the Admirable Crichton of modern mechanics.\n\nRichard Roberts was born in 1789, at Carreghova in the parish of\nLlanymynech.  His father was by trade a shoemaker, to which he\noccasionally added the occupation of toll-keeper.  The house in which\nRichard was born stood upon the border line which then divided the\ncounties of Salop and Montgomery; the front door opening in the one\ncounty, and the back door in the other.  Richard, when a boy, received\nnext to no education, and as soon as he was of fitting age was put to\ncommon labouring work.  For some time he worked in a quarry near his\nfather's dwelling; but being of an ingenious turn, he occupied his\nleisure in making various articles of mechanism, partly for amusement\nand partly for profit.  One of his first achievements, while working as\na quarryman, was a spinning-wheel, of which he was very proud, for it\nwas considered \"a good job.\"  Thus he gradually acquired dexterity in\nhandling tools, and he shortly came to entertain the ambition of\nbecoming a mechanic.\n\nThere were several ironworks in the neighbour hood, and thither he went\nin search of employment.  He succeeded in finding work as a\npattern-maker at Bradley, near Bilston; under John Wilkinson, the\nfamous ironmaster--a man of great enterprise as well as mechanical\nskill; for he was the first man, as already stated, that Watt could\nfind capable of boring a cylinder with any approach to truth, for the\npurposes of his steam-engines.  After acquiring some practical\nknowledge of the art of working in wood as well as iron, Roberts\nproceeded to Birmingham, where he passed through different shops,\ngaining further experience in mechanical practice.  He tried his hand\nat many kinds of work, and acquired considerable dexterity in each.  He\nwas regarded as a sort of jack-of-all-trades; for he was a good turner,\na tolerable wheel-wright, and could repair mill-work at a pinch.\n\nHe next moved northward to the Horsley ironworks, Tipton, where he was\nworking as a pattern-maker when he had the misfortune to be drawn in\nhis own county for the militia.  He immediately left his work and made\nhis way homeward to Llanymynech, determined not to be a soldier or even\na militiaman.  But home was not the place for him to rest in, and after\nbidding a hasty adieu to his father, he crossed the country northward\non foot and reached Liverpool, in the hope of finding work there.\nFailing in that, he set out for Manchester and reached it at dusk, very\nweary and very miry in consequence of the road being in such a wretched\nstate of mud and ruts.  He relates that, not knowing a person in the\ntown, he went up to an apple-stall ostensibly to buy a pennyworth of\napples, but really to ask the stall-keeper if he knew of any person in\nwant of a hand.  Was there any turner in the neighbourhood? Yes, round\nthe corner.  Thither he went at once, found the wood-turner in, and was\npromised a job on the following morning.  He remained with the turner\nfor only a short time, after which he found a job in Salford at lathe\nand tool-making.  But hearing that the militia warrant-officers were\nstill searching for him, he became uneasy and determined to take refuge\nin London.\n\nHe trudged all the way on foot to that great hiding-place, and first\ntried Holtzapffel's, the famous tool-maker's, but failing in his\napplication he next went to Maudslay's and succeeded in getting\nemployment.  He worked there for some time, acquiring much valuable\npractical knowledge in the use of tools, cultivating his skill by\ncontact with first-class workmen, and benefiting by the spirit of\nactive contrivance which pervaded the Maudslay shops.  His manual\ndexterity greatly increased, and his inventive ingenuity fully\nstimulated, he determined on making his way back to Manchester, which,\neven more than London itself, at that time presented abundant openings\nfor men of mechanical skill.  Hence we find so many of the best\nmechanics trained at Maudslay's and Clement's--Nasmyth, Lewis, Muir,\nRoberts, Whitworth, and others--shortly rising into distinction there\nas leading mechanicians and tool-makers.\n\nThe mere enumeration of the various results of Mr. Roberts's inventive\nskill during the period of his settlement at Manchester as a mechanical\nengineer, would occupy more space than we can well spare.  But we may\nbriefly mention a few of the more important.  In 1816, while carrying\non business on his own account in Deansgate, he invented his improved\nsector for correctly sizing wheels in blank previously to their being\ncut, which is still extensively used.  In the same year he invented his\nimproved screw-lathe; and in the following year, at the request of the\nboroughreeve and constables of Manchester, he contrived an oscillating\nand rotating wet gas meter of a new kind, which enabled them to sell\ngas by measure.  This was the first meter in which a water lute was\napplied to prevent the escape of gas by the index shaft, the want of\nwhich, as well as its great complexity, had prevented the only other\ngas meter then in existence from working satisfactorily.  The water\nlute was immediately adopted by the patentee of that meter.  The\nplaning machine, though claimed, as we have seen, by many inventors,\nwas constructed by Mr. Roberts after an original plan of his own in\n1817, and became the tool most generally employed in mechanical\nworkshops--acting by means of a chain and rack--though it has since\nbeen superseded to some extent by the planing machine of Whitworth,\nwhich works both ways upon an endless screw.  Improvements followed in\nthe slide-lathe (giving a large range of speed with increased diameters\nfor the same size of headstocks, &c.), in the wheel-cutting engine, in\nthe scale-beam (by which, with a load of 2 oz.  on each end, the\nfifteen-hundredth part of a grain could be indicated), in the\nbroaching-machine, the slotting-machine, and other engines.\n\nBut the inventions by which his fame became most extensively known\narose out of circumstances connected with the cotton manufactures of\nManchester and the neighbourhood.  The great improvements which he\nintroduced in the machine for making weavers' reeds, led to the\nformation of the firm of Sharp, Roberts, and Co., of which Mr. Roberts\nwas the acting mechanical partner for many years.  Not less important\nwere his improvements in power-looms for weaving fustians, which were\nextensively adopted.  But by far the most famous of his inventions was\nunquestionably his Self-acting Mule, one of the most elaborate and\nbeautiful pieces of machinery ever contrived.  Before its invention,\nthe working of the entire machinery of the cotton-mill, as well as the\nemployment of the piecers, cleaners, and other classes of operatives,\ndepended upon the spinners, who, though receiving the highest rates of\npay, were by much the most given to strikes; and they were frequently\naccustomed to turn out in times when trade was brisk, thereby bringing\nthe whole operations of the manufactories to a standstill, and throwing\nall the other operatives out of employment.  A long-continued strike of\nthis sort took place in 1824, when the idea occurred to the masters\nthat it might be possible to make the spinning-mules run out and in at\nthe proper speed by means of self-acting machinery, and thus render\nthem in some measure independent of the more refractory class of their\nworkmen.  It seemed, however, to be so very difficult a problem, that\nthey were by no means sanguine of success in its solution.  Some time\npassed before they could find any mechanic willing so much as to\nconsider the subject.  Mr. Ashton of Staley-bridge made every effort\nwith this object, but the answer he got was uniformly the same.  The\nthing was declared to be impracticable and impossible.  Mr. Ashton,\naccompanied by two other leading spinners, called on Sharp, Roberts,\nand Co., to seek an interview with Mr. Roberts.  They introduced the\nsubject to him, but he would scarcely listen to their explanations,\ncutting them short with the remark that he knew nothing whatever about\ncotton-spinning.  They insisted, nevertheless, on explaining to him\nwhat they required, but they went away without being able to obtain\nfrom him any promise of assistance in bringing out the required machine.\n\nThe strike continued, and the manufacturers again called upon Mr.\nRoberts, but with no better result.  A third time they called and\nappealed to Mr. Sharp, the capitalist of the firm, who promised to use\nhis best endeavours to induce his mechanical partner to take the matter\nin hand.  But Mr. Roberts, notwithstanding his reticence, had been\noccupied in carefully pondering the subject since Mr. Ashton's first\ninterview with him.  The very difficulty of the problem to be solved\nhad tempted him boldly to grapple with it, though he would not hold out\nthe slightest expectation to the cotton-spinners of his being able to\nhelp them in their emergency until he saw his way perfectly clear.\nThat time had now come; and when Mr. Sharp introduced the subject, he\nsaid he had turned the matter over and thought he could construct the\nrequired self-acting machinery.  It was arranged that he should proceed\nwith it at once, and after a close study of four months he brought out\nthe machine now so extensively known as the self-acting mule.  The\ninvention was patented in 1825, and was perfected by subsequent\nadditions, which were also patented.\n\nLike so many other inventions, the idea of the self-acting mule was not\nnew.  Thus Mr. William Strutt of Derby, the father of Lord Belper,\ninvented a machine of this sort at an early period; Mr. William Belly,\nof the New Lanark Mills, invented a second; and various other\nprojectors tried their skill in the same direction; but none of these\ninventions came into practical use.  In such cases it has become\ngenerally admitted that the real inventor is not the person who\nsuggests the idea of the invention, but he who first works it out into\na practicable process, and so makes it of practical and commercial\nvalue.  This was accomplished by Mr. Roberts, who, working out the idea\nafter his own independent methods, succeeded in making the first\nself-acting mule that would really act as such; and he is therefore\nfairly entitled to be regarded as its inventor.\n\nBy means of this beautiful contrivance, spindle-carriages; bearing\nhundreds of spindles, run themselves out and in by means of automatic\nmachinery, at the proper speed, without a hand touching them; the only\nlabour required being that of a few boys and girls to watch them and\nmend the broken threads when the carriage recedes from the roller beam,\nand to stop it when the cop is completely formed, as is indicated by\nthe bell of the counter attached to the working gear.  Mr. Baines\ndescribes the self-acting mule while at work as \"drawing out, twisting,\nand winding up many thousand threads, with unfailing precision and\nindefatigable patience and strength--a scene as magical to the eye\nwhich is not familiarized with it, as the effects have been marvellous\nin augmenting the wealth and population of the country.\" [5]\n\nMr. Roberts's great success with the self-acting mule led to his being\noften appealed to for help in the mechanics of manufacturing.  In 1826,\nthe year after his patent was taken out, he was sent for to Mulhouse,\nin Alsace, to design and arrange the machine establishment of Andre\nKoechlin and Co.; and in that and the two subsequent years he fairly\nset the works a-going, instructing the workmen in the manufacture of\nspinning-machinery, and thus contributing largely to the success of the\nFrench cotton manufacture.  In 1832 he patented his invention of the\nRadial Arm for \"winding on\" in the self-acting mule, now in general\nuse; and in future years he took out sundry patents for roving,\nslubbing, spinning, and doubling cotton and other fibrous materials;\nand for weaving, beetling, and mangling fabrics of various sorts.\n\nA considerable branch of business carried on by the firm of Sharp,\nRoberts, and Co. was the manufacture of iron billiard-tables, which\nwere constructed with almost perfect truth by means of Mr. Roberts's\nplaning-machine, and became a large article of export.  But a much more\nimportant and remunerative department was the manufacture of\nlocomotives, which was begun by the firm shortly after the opening of\nthe Liverpool and Manchester Railway had marked this as one of the\nchief branches of future mechanical engineering.  Mr. Roberts adroitly\nseized the opportunity presented by this new field of invention and\nenterprise, and devoted himself for a time to the careful study of the\nlocomotive and its powers.  As early as the year 1829 we find him\npresenting to the Manchester Mechanics' Institute a machine exhibiting\nthe nature of friction upon railroads, in solution of the problem then\nunder discussion in the scientific journals.  In the following year he\npatented an arrangement for communicating power to both driving-wheels\nof the locomotive, at all times in the exact proportions required when\nturning to the right or left,--an arrangement which has since been\nadopted in many road locomotives and agricultural engines.  In the same\npatent will be found embodied his invention of the steam-brake, which\nwas also a favourite idea of George Stephenson, since elaborated by Mr.\nMacConnell of the London and North-Western Railway.  In 1834, Sharp,\nRoberts, and Co. began the manufacture of locomotives on a large scale;\nand the compactness of their engines, the excellence of their\nworkmanship, and the numerous original improvements introduced in them,\nspeedily secured for the engines of the Atlas firm a high reputation\nand a very large demand.  Among Mr. Roberts's improvements may be\nmentioned his method of manufacturing the crank axle, of welding the\nrim and tyres of the wheels, and his arrangement and form of the\nwrought-iron framing and axle-guards.  His system of templets and\ngauges, by means of which every part of an engine or tender\ncorresponded with that of every other engine or tender of the same\nclass, was as great an improvement as Maudslay's system of uniformity\nof parts in other descriptions of machinery.\n\nIn connection with the subject of railways, we may allude in passing to\nMr. Roberts's invention of the Jacquard punching machine--a self-acting\ntool of great power, used for punching any required number of holes, of\nany pitch and to any pattern, with mathematical accuracy, in bridge or\nboiler plates.  The origin of this invention was somewhat similar to\nthat of the self-acting mule.  The contractors for the Conway Tubular\nBridge while under construction, in 1848, were greatly hampered by\ncombinations amongst the workmen, and they despaired of being able to\nfinish the girders within the time specified in the contract.  The\npunching of the iron plates by hand was a tedious and expensive as well\nas an inaccurate process; and the work was proceeding so slowly that\nthe contractors found it absolutely necessary to adopt some new method\nof punching if they were to finish the work in time.  In their\nemergency they appealed to Mr. Roberts, and endeavoured to persuade him\nto take the matter up.  He at length consented to do so, and evolved\nthe machine in question during his evening's leisure--for the most part\nwhile quietly sipping his tea.  The machine was produced, the\ncontractors were enabled to proceed with the punching of the plates\nindependent of the refractory men, and the work was executed with a\ndespatch, accuracy, and excellence that would not otherwise have been\npossible.  Only a few years since Mr. Roberts added a useful companion\nto the Jacquard punching machine, in his combined self-acting machine\nfor shearing iron and punching both webs of angle or T iron\nsimultaneously to any required pitch; though this machine, like others\nwhich have proceeded from his fertile brain, is ahead even of this\nfast-manufacturing age, and has not yet come into general use, but is\ncertain to do so before many years have elapsed.\n\nThese inventions were surely enough for one man to have accomplished;\nbut we have not yet done.  The mere enumeration of his other inventions\nwould occupy several pages.  We shall merely allude to a few of them.\nOne was his Turret Clock, for which he obtained the medal at the Great\nExhibition of 1851.  Another was his Prize Electro-Magnet of 1845.\nWhen this subject was first mentioned to him, he said he did not know\nanything of the theory or practice of electro-magnetism, but he would\ntry and find out.  The result of his trying was that he won the prize\nfor the most powerful electro-magnet:  one is placed in the museum at\nPeel Park, Manchester, and another with the Scottish Society of Arts,\nEdinburgh.  In 1846 he perfected an American invention for making\ncigars by machinery; enabling a boy, working one of his cigar-engines,\nto make as many as 5000 in a day.  In 1852 he patented improvements in\nthe construction, propelling, and equipment of steamships, which have,\nwe believe, been adopted to a certain extent by the Admiralty; and a\nfew years later, in 1855, we find him presenting the Secretary of War\nwith plans of elongated rifle projectiles to be used in smooth-bore\nordnance with a view to utilize the old-pattern gun.  His head, like\nmany inventors of the time, being full of the mechanics of war, he went\nso far as to wait upon Louis Napoleon, and laid before him a plan by\nwhich Sebastopol was to be blown down.  In short, upon whatever subject\nhe turned his mind, he left the impress of his inventive faculty.  If\nit was imperfect, he improved it; if incapable of improvement, and\nimpracticable, he invented something entirely new, superseding it\naltogether.  But with all his inventive genius, in the exercise of\nwhich Mr. Roberts has so largely added to the productive power of the\ncountry, we regret to say that he is not gifted with the commercial\nfaculty.  He has helped others in their difficulties, but forgotten\nhimself.  Many have profited by his inventions, without even\nacknowledging the obligations which they owed to him.  They have used\nhis brains and copied his tools, and the \"sucked orange\" is all but\nforgotten.  There may have been a want of worldly wisdom on his part,\nbut it is lamentable to think that one of the most prolific and useful\ninventors of his time should in his old age be left to fight with\npoverty.\n\nMr. Whitworth is another of the first-class tool-makers of Manchester\nwho has turned to excellent account his training in the workshops of\nMaudslay and Clement.  He has carried fully out the system of\nuniformity in Screw Threads which they initiated; and he has still\nfurther improved the mechanism of the planing machine, enabling it to\nwork both backwards and forwards by means of a screw and roller motion.\nHis \"Jim Crow Machine,\" so called from its peculiar motion in reversing\nitself and working both ways, is an extremely beautiful tool, adapted\nalike for horizontal, vertical, or angular motions.  The minute\naccuracy of Mr. Whitworth's machines is not the least of their merits;\nand nothing will satisfy him short of perfect truth.  At the meeting of\nthe Institute of Mechanical Engineers at Glasgow in 1856 he read a\npaper on the essential importance of possessing a true plane as a\nstandard of reference in mechanical constructions, and he described\nelaborately the true method of securing it,--namely, by scraping,\ninstead of by the ordinary process of grinding.  At the same meeting he\nexhibited a machine of his invention by which he stated that a\ndifference of the millionth part of an inch in length could at once be\ndetected.  He also there urged his favourite idea of uniformity, and\nproper gradations of size of parts, in all the various branches of the\nmechanical arts, as a chief means towards economy of production--a\nprinciple, as he showed, capable of very extensive application.  To\nshow the progress of tools and machinery in his own time, Mr. Whitworth\ncited the fact that thirty years since the cost of labour for making a\nsurface of cast-iron true--one of the most important operations in\nmechanics--by chipping and filing by the hand, was 12s. a square foot;\nwhereas it is now done by the planing machine at a cost for labour of\nless than a penny.  Then in machinery, pieces of 74 reed\nprinting-cotton cloth of 29 yards each could not be produced at less\ncost than 30s. 6d. per piece; whereas the same description is now sold\nfor 3s. 9d.  Mr. Whitworth has been among the most effective workers in\nthis field of improvement, his tools taking the first place in point of\nspeed, accuracy, and finish of work, in which respects they challenge\ncompetition with the world.  Mr. Whitworth has of late years been\napplying himself with his accustomed ardour to the development of the\npowers of rifled guns and projectiles,--a branch of mechanical science\nin which he confessedly holds a foremost place, and in perfecting which\nhe is still occupied.\n\n\n\n[1] Engineer, Oct. 10th, 1862.\n\n[2] We are informed in Mr. Longstaffe's Annals and Characteristics of\nDarlington, that the spinning of flax by machinery was first begun by\none John Kendrew, an ingenious self-taught mechanic of that town, who\ninvented a machine for the purpose, for which he took out a patent in\n1787.  Mr. Marshall went over from Leeds to see his machine, and agreed\nto give him so much per spindle for the right to use it.  But ceasing\nto pay the patent right, Kendrew commenced an action against him for a\nsum of nine hundred pounds alleged to be due under the agreement.  The\nclaim was disputed, and Kendrew lost his action; and it is added in\nLongstaffe's Annals, that even had he succeeded, it would have been of\nno use; for Mr. Marshall declared that he had not then the money\nwherewith to pay him.  It is possible that Matthew Murray may have\nobtained some experience of flax-machinery in working for Kendrew,\nwhich afterwards proved of use to him in Mr. Marshall's establishment.\n\n[3] The purchase of this large piece of ground, known as Camp Field,\nhad the effect of \"plugging up\" Matthew Murray for a time; and it\nremained disused, except for the deposit of dead dogs and other\nrubbish, for more than half a century.  It has only been enclosed\nduring the present year, and now forms part of the works of Messrs.\nSmith, Beacock, and Tannet, the eminent tool-makers.\n\n[4] Among more recent improvers of flax-machinery, the late Sir Peter\nFairbairn is entitled to high merit:  the work turned out by him being\nof first-rate excellence, embodying numerous inventions and\nimprovements of great value and importance.\n\n[5] EDWARD BAINES, Esq., M.P., History of the Cotton Manufacture, 212.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nJAMES NASMYTH.\n\n        \"By Hammer and Hand\n         All Arts doth stand.\"\n                        Hammermen's Motto.\n\n\nThe founder Of the Scotch family of Naesmyth is said to have derived\nhis name from the following circumstance.  In the course of the feuds\nwhich raged for some time between the Scotch kings and their powerful\nsubjects the Earls of Douglas, a rencontre took place one day on the\noutskirts of a Border village, when the king's adherents were worsted.\nOne of them took refuge in the village smithy, where, hastily\ndisguising himself, and donning a spare leathern apron, he pretended to\nbe engaged in assisting the smith with his work, when a party of the\nDouglas followers rushed in.  They glanced at the pretended workman at\nthe anvil, and observed him deliver a blow upon it so unskilfully that\nthe hammer-shaft broke in his hand.  On this one of the Douglas men\nrushed at him, calling out, \"Ye're nae smyth!\" The assailed man seized\nhis sword, which lay conveniently at hand, and defended himself so\nvigorously that he shortly killed his assailant, while the smith\nbrained another with his hammer; and, a party of the king's men having\ncome to their help, the rest were speedily overpowered.  The royal\nforces then rallied, and their temporary defeat was converted into a\nvictory.  The king bestowed a grant of land on his follower \"Nae\nSmyth,\" who assumed for his arms a sword between two hammers with\nbroken shafts, and the motto \"Non arte sed Marte,\" as if to disclaim\nthe art of the Smith, in which he had failed, and to emphasize the\nsuperiority of the warrior.  Such is said to be the traditional origin\nof the family of Naesmyth of Posso in Peeblesshire, who continue to\nbear the same name and arms.\n\nIt is remarkable that the inventor of the steam-hammer should have so\neffectually contradicted the name he bears and reversed the motto of\nhis family; for so far from being \"Nae Smyth,\" he may not\ninappropriately be designated the very Vulcan of the nineteenth\ncentury.  His hammer is a tool of immense power and pliancy, but for\nwhich we must have stopped short in many of those gigantic engineering\nworks which are among the marvels of the age we live in.  It possesses\nso much precision and delicacy that it will chip the end of an egg\nresting in a glass on the anvil without breaking it, while it delivers\na blow of ten tons with such a force as to be felt shaking the parish.\nIt is therefore with a high degree of appropriateness that Mr. Nasmyth\nhas discarded the feckless hammer with the broken shaft, and assumed\nfor his emblem his own magnificent steam-hammer, at the same time\nreversing the family motto, which he has converted into \"Non Marte sed\nArte.\"\n\nJames Nasmyth belongs to a family whose genius in art has long been\nrecognised.  His father, Alexander Nasmyth of Edinburgh, was a\nlandscape-painter of great eminence, whose works are sometimes\nconfounded with those of his son Patrick, called the English Hobbema,\nthough his own merits are peculiar and distinctive.  The elder Nasmyth\nwas also an admirable portrait painter, as his head of Burns--the best\never painted of the poet--bears ample witness.  His daughters, the\nMisses Nasmyth, were highly skilled painters of landscape, and their\nworks are well known and much prized.  James, the youngest of the\nfamily, inherits the same love of art, though his name is more\nextensively known as a worker and inventor in iron.  He was born at\nEdinburgh, on the 19th of August, 1808; and his attention was early\ndirected to mechanics by the circumstance of this being one of his\nfather's hobbies.  Besides being an excellent painter, Mr. Nasmyth had\na good general knowledge of architecture and civil engineering, and\ncould work at the lathe and handle tools with the dexterity of a\nmechanic.  He employed nearly the whole of his spare time in a little\nworkshop which adjoined his studio, where he encouraged his youngest\nson to work with him in all sorts of materials.  Among his visitors at\nthe studio were Professor Leslie, Patrick Miller of Dalswinton, and\nother men of distinction.  He assisted Mr. Miller in his early\nexperiments with paddle-boats, which eventually led to the invention of\nthe steamboat.  It was a great advantage for the boy to be trained by a\nfather who so loved excellence in all its forms, and could minister to\nhis love of mechanics by his own instruction and practice.  James used\nto drink in with pleasure and profit the conversation which passed\nbetween his father and his visitors on scientific and mechanical\nsubjects; and as he became older, the resolve grew stronger in him\nevery day that he would be a mechanical engineer, and nothing else.  At\na proper age, he was sent to the High School, then as now celebrated\nfor the excellence of its instruction, and there he laid the\nfoundations of a sound and liberal education.  But he has himself told\nthe simple story of his early life in such graphic terms that we feel\nwe cannot do better than quote his own words:--[1]\n\n\"I had the good luck,\" he says, \"to have for a school companion the son\nof an iron founder.  Every spare hour that I could command was devoted\nto visits to his father's iron foundry, where I delighted to watch the\nvarious processes of moulding, iron-melting, casting, forging,\npattern-making, and other smith and metal work; and although I was only\nabout twelve years old at the time, I used to lend a hand, in which\nhearty zeal did a good deal to make up for want of strength.  I look\nback to the Saturday afternoons spent in the workshops of that small\nfoundry, as an important part of my education.  I did not trust to\nreading about such and such things; I saw and handled them; and all the\nideas in connection with them became permanent in my mind.  I also\nobtained there--what was of much value to me in after life--a\nconsiderable acquaintance with the nature and characters of workmen.\nBy the time I was fifteen, I could work and turn out really respectable\njobs in wood, brass, iron, and steel:  indeed, in the working of the\nlatter inestimable material, I had at a very early age (eleven or\ntwelve) acquired considerable proficiency.  As that was the pre-lucifer\nmatch period, the possession of a steel and tinder box was quite a\npatent of nobility among boys.  So I used to forge old files into\n'steels' in my father's little workshop, and harden them and produce\nsuch first-rate, neat little articles in that line, that I became quite\nfamous amongst my school companions; and many a task have I had excused\nme by bribing the monitor, whose grim sense of duty never could\nwithstand the glimpse of a steel.\n\n\"My first essay at making a steam engine was when I was fifteen.  I\nthen made a real working; steam-engine, 1 3/4 diameter cylinder, and 8\nin. stroke, which not only could act, but really did some useful work;\nfor I made it grind the oil colours which my father required for his\npainting.  Steam engine models, now so common, were exceedingly scarce\nin those days, and very difficult to be had; and as the demand for them\narose, I found it both delightful and profitable to make them; as well\nas sectional models of steam engines, which I introduced for the\npurpose of exhibiting the movements of all the parts, both exterior and\ninterior.  With the results of the sale of such models I was enabled to\npay the price of tickets of admission to the lectures on natural\nphilosophy and chemistry delivered in the University of Edinburgh.\nAbout the same time (1826) I was so happy as to be employed by\nProfessor Leslie in making models and portions of apparatus required by\nhim for his lectures and philosophical investigations, and I had also\nthe inestimable good fortune to secure his friendship.  His admirably\nclear manner of communicating a knowledge of the fundamental principles\nof mechanical science rendered my intercourse with him of the utmost\nimportance to myself.  A hearty, cheerful, earnest desire to toil in\nhis service, caused him to take pleasure in instructing me by\noccasional explanations of what might otherwise have remained obscure.\n\n\"About the years 1827 and 1828, the subject of steam-carriages for\ncommon roads occupied much of the attention of the public.  Many tried\nto solve the problem.  I made a working model of an engine which\nperformed so well that some friends determined to give me the means of\nmaking one on a larger scale.  This I did; and I shall never forget the\npleasure and the downright hard work I had in producing, in the autumn\nof 1828, at an outlay of 60L., a complete steam-carriage, that ran many\na mile with eight persons on it.  After keeping it in action two\nmonths, to the satisfaction of all who were interested in it, my\nfriends allowed me to dispose of it, and I sold it a great bargain,\nafter which the engine was used in driving a small factory.  I may\nmention that in that engine I employed the waste steam to cause an\nincreased draught by its discharge up the chimney.  This important use\nof the waste steam had been introduced by George Stephenson some years\nbefore, though entirely unknown to me.\n\n\"The earnest desire which I cherished of getting forward in the real\nbusiness of life induced me to turn my attention to obtaining\nemployment in some of the great engineering establishments of the day,\nat the head of which, in my fancy as well as in reality, stood that of\nHenry Maudslay, of London.  It was the summit of my ambition to get\nwork in that establishment; but as my father had not the means of\npaying a premium, I determined to try what I could do towards attaining\nmy object by submitting to Mr. Maudslay actual specimens of my\ncapability as a young workman and draughtsman.  To this end I set to\nwork and made a small steam-engine, every part of which was the result\nof my own handiwork, including the casting and the forging of the\nseveral parts.  This I turned out in such a style as I should even now\nbe proud of.  My sample drawings were, I may say, highly respectable.\nArmed with such means of obtaining the good opinion of the great Henry\nMaudslay, on the 19th of May, 1829, I sailed for London in a Leith\nsmack, and after an eight days' voyage saw the metropolis for the first\ntime.  I made bold to call on Mr. Maudslay, and told him my simple\ntale.  He desired me to bring my models for him to look at.  I did so,\nand when he came to me I could see by the expression of his cheerful,\nwell-remembered countenance, that I had attained my object.  He then\nand there appointed me to be his own private workman, to assist him in\nhis little paradise of a workshop, furnished with the models of\nimproved machinery and engineering tools of which he has been the great\noriginator.  He left me to arrange as to wages with his chief cashier,\nMr. Robert Young, and on the first Saturday evening I accordingly went\nto the counting-house to enquire of him about my pay.  He asked me what\nwould satisfy me.  Knowing the value of the situation I had obtained,\nand having a very modest notion of my worthiness to occupy it, I said,\nthat if he would not consider 10s. a week too much, I thought I could\ndo very well with that.  I suppose he concluded that I had some means\nof my own to live on besides the 10s. a week which I asked.  He little\nknew that I had determined not to cost my father another farthing when\nI left-home to begin the world on my own account.  My proposal was at\nonce acceded to.  And well do I remember the pride and delight I felt\nwhen I carried to my three shillings a week lodging that night my first\nwages.  Ample they were in my idea; for I knew how little I could live\non, and was persuaded that by strict economy I could easily contrive to\nmake the money support me.  To help me in this object, I contrived a\nsmall cooking apparatus, which I forthwith got made by a tinsmith in\nLambeth, at a cost of 6s., and by its aid I managed to keep the eating\nand drinking part of my private account within 3s. 6d. per week, or 4s.\nat the outside.  I had three meat dinners a week, and generally four\nrice and milk dinners, all of which were cooked by my little apparatus,\nwhich I set in action after breakfast.  The oil cost not quite a\nhalfpenny per day.  The meat dinners consisted of a stew of from a half\nto three quarters of a lb.  of leg of beef, the meat costing 3 1/2d.\nper lb., which, with sliced potatoes and a little onion, and as much\nwater as just covered all, with a sprinkle of salt and black pepper, by\nthe time I returned to dinner at half-past six furnished a repast in\nevery respect as good as my appetite.  For breakfast I had coffee and a\ndue proportion of quartern loaf.  After the first year of my employment\nunder Mr. Maudslay, my wages were raised to 15s. a week, and I then,\nbut not till then, indulged in the luxury of butter to my bread.  I am\nthe more particular in all this, to show you that I was a thrifty\nhousekeeper, although only a lodger in a 3s. room.  I have the old\napparatus by me yet, and I shall have another dinner out of it ere I am\na year older, out of regard to days that were full of the real romance\nof life.\n\n\"On the death of Henry Maudslay in 1831, I passed over to the service\nof his worthy partner, Mr. Joshua Field, and acted as his draughtsman,\nmuch to my advantage, until the end of that year, when I returned to\nEdinburgh, to construct a small stock of engineering tools for the\npurpose of enabling me to start in business on my own account.  This\noccupied me until the spring of 1833, and during the interval I was\naccustomed to take in jobs to execute in my little workshop in\nEdinburgh, so as to obtain the means of completing my stock of\ntools.[2]  In June, 1834, I went to Manchester, and took a flat of an\nold mill in Dale Street, where I began business.  In two years my stock\nhad so increased as to overload the floor of the old building to such\nan extent that the land lord, Mr. Wrenn, became alarmed, especially as\nthe tenant below me--a glass-cutter--had a visit from the end of a\n20-horse engine beam one morning among his cut tumblers.  To set their\nanxiety at rest, I went out that evening to Patricroft and took a look\nat a rather choice bit of land bounded on one side by the canal, and on\nthe other by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.  By the end of the\nweek I had secured a lease of the site for 999 years; by the end of the\nmonth my wood sheds were erected; the ring of the hammer on the smith's\nanvil was soon heard all over the place; and the Bridgewater Foundry\nwas fairly under way.  There I toiled right heartily until December\n31st, 1856, when I retired to enjoy in active leisure the reward of a\nlaborious life, during which, with the blessing of God, I enjoyed much\ntrue happiness through the hearty love which I always had for my\nprofession; and I trust I may be allowed to say, without undue vanity,\nthat I have left behind me some useful results of my labours in those\ninventions with which my name is identified, which have had no small\nshare in the accomplishment of some of the greatest mechanical works of\nour age.\"  If Mr. Nasmyth had accomplished nothing more than the\ninvention of his steam-hammer, it would have been enough to found a\nreputation.  Professor Tomlinson describes it as \"one of the most\nperfect of artificial machines and noblest triumphs of mind over matter\nthat modern English engineers have yet developed.\" [3]\n\nThe hand-hammer has always been an important tool, and, in the form of\nthe stone celt, it was perhaps the first invented.  When the hammer of\niron superseded that of stone, it was found practicable in the hands of\na \"cunning\" workman to execute by its means metal work of great beauty\nand even delicacy.  But since the invention of cast-iron, and the\nmanufacture of wrought-iron in large masses, the art of hammer-working\nhas almost become lost; and great artists, such as Matsys of Antwerp\nand Rukers of Nuremberg were,[4] no longer think it worth their while\nto expend time and skill in working on so humble a material as\nwrought-iron.  It is evident from the marks of care and elaborate\ndesign which many of these early works exhibit, that the workman's\nheart was in his work, and that his object was not merely to get it out\nof hand, but to execute it in first-rate artistic style.\n\nWhen the use of iron extended and larger ironwork came to be forged,\nfor cannon, tools, and machinery, the ordinary hand-hammer was found\ninsufficient, and the helve or forge-hammer was invented.  This was\nusually driven by a water-wheel, or by oxen or horses.  The tilt-hammer\nwas another form in which it was used, the smaller kinds being worked\nby the foot.  Among Watt's various inventions, was a tilt-hammer of\nconsiderable power, which he at first worked by means of a water-wheel,\nand afterwards by a steam engine regulated by a fly-wheel.  His first\nhammer of this kind was 120 lbs. in weight; it was raised eight inches\nbefore making each blow.  Watt afterwards made a tilt-hammer for Mr.\nWilkinson of Bradley Forge, of 7 1/2 cwt., and it made 300 blows a\nminute.  Other improvements were made in the hammer from time to time,\nbut no material alteration was made in the power by which it was worked\nuntil Mr. Nasmyth took it in hand, and applying to it the force of\nsteam, at once provided the worker in iron with the most formidable of\nmachine-tools.  This important invention originated as follows:\n\nIn the early part of 1837, the directors of the Great Western\nSteam-Ship Company sent Mr. Francis Humphries, their engineer, to\nconsult Mr. Nasmyth as to some engineering tools of unusual size and\npower, which were required for the construction of the engines of the\n\"Great Britain\" steamship.  They had determined to construct those\nengines on the vertical trunk-engine principle, in accordance with Mr.\nHumphries' designs; and very complete works were erected by them at\ntheir Bristol dockyard for the execution of the requisite machinery,\nthe most important of the tools being supplied by Nasmyth and Gaskell.\nThe engines were in hand, when a difficulty arose with respect to the\nenormous paddle-shaft of the vessel, which was of such a size of\nforging as had never before been executed.  Mr. Humphries applied to\nthe largest engineering firms throughout the country for tenders of the\nprice at which they would execute this part of the work, but to his\nsurprise and dismay he found that not one of the firms he applied to\nwould undertake so large a forging.  In this dilemma he wrote to Mr.\nNasmyth on the 24th November,1838, informing him of this unlooked-for\ndifficulty.  \"I find,\" said he, \"there is not a forge-hammer in England\nor Scotland powerful enough to forge the paddle-shaft of the engines\nfor the 'Great Britain!' What am I to do?  Do you think I might dare to\nuse cast-iron?\"\n\nThis letter immediately set Mr. Nasmyth a-thinking.  How was it that\nexisting hammers were incapable of forging a wrought-iron shaft of\nthirty inches diameter? Simply because of their want of compass, or\nrange and fall, as well as power of blow.  A few moments' rapid thought\nsatisfied him that it was by rigidly adhering to the old traditional\nform of hand-hammer--of which the tilt, though driven by steam, was but\na modification--that the difficulty had arisen.  When even the largest\nhammer was tilted up to its full height, its range was so small, that\nwhen a piece of work of considerable size was placed on the anvil, the\nhammer became \"gagged,\" and, on such an occasion, where the forging\nrequired the most powerful blow, it received next to no blow at\nall,--the clear space for fall being almost entirely occupied by the\nwork on the anvil.\n\nThe obvious remedy was to invent some method, by which a block of iron\nshould be lifted to a sufficient height above the object on which it\nwas desired to strike a blow, and let the block fall down upon the\nwork,--guiding it in its descent by such simple means as should give\nthe required precision in the percussive action of the falling mass.\nFollowing out this idea, Mr. Nasmyth at once sketched on paper his\nsteam-hammer, having it clearly before him in his mind's eye a few\nminutes after receiving Mr. Humphries' letter narrating his\nunlooked-for difficulty.  The hammer, as thus sketched, consisted of,\nfirst an anvil on which to rest the work; second, a block of iron\nconstituting the hammer or blow-giving part; third, an inverted\nsteam-cylinder to whose piston-rod the block was attached.  All that\nwas then required to produce by such means a most effective hammer, was\nsimply to admit steam in the cylinder so as to act on the under side of\nthe piston, and so raise the block attached to the piston-rod, and by a\nsimple contrivance to let the steam escape and so permit the block\nrapidly to descend by its own gravity upon the work then on the anvil.\nSuch, in a few words, is the rationale of the steam-hammer.\n\nBy the same day's post, Mr. Nasmyth wrote to Mr. Humphries, inclosing a\nsketch of the invention by which he proposed to forge the \"Great\nBritain\" paddle-shaft.  Mr. Humphries showed it to Mr. Brunel, the\nengineer-inchief of the company, to Mr. Guppy, the managing director,\nand to others interested in the undertaking, by all of whom it was\nheartily approved.  Mr. Nasmyth gave permission to communicate his\nplans to such forge proprietors as might feel disposed to erect such a\nhammer to execute the proposed work,--the only condition which he made\nbeing, that in the event of his hammer being adopted, he was to be\nallowed to supply it according to his own design.\n\nThe paddle-shaft of the \"Great Britain\" was, however, never forged.\nAbout that time, the substitution of the Screw for the Paddle-wheel as\na means of propulsion of steam-vessels was attracting much attention;\nand the performances of the \"Archimedes\" were so successful as to\ninduce Mr. Brunel to recommend his Directors to adopt the new power.\nThey yielded to his entreaty.  The great engines which Mr. Humphries\nhad designed were accordingly set aside; and he was required to produce\nfresh designs of engines suited for screw propulsion.  The result was\nfatal to Mr. Humphries.  The labour, the anxiety, and perhaps the\ndisappointment, proved too much for him, and a brain-fever carried him\noff; so that neither his great paddle-shaft nor Mr. Nasmyth's\nsteam-hammer to forge it was any longer needed.\n\nThe hammer was left to bide its time.  No forge-master would take it\nup.  The inventor wrote to all the great firms, urging its superiority\nto every other tool for working malleable iron into all kinds of forge\nwork.  Thus he wrote and sent illustrative sketches of his hammer to\nAccramans and Morgan of Bristol, to the late Benjamin Hick and Rushton\nand Eckersley of Bolton, to Howard and Ravenhill of Rotherhithe, and\nother firms; but unhappily bad times for the iron trade had set in; and\nalthough all to whom he communicated his design were much struck with\nits simplicity and obvious advantages, the answer usually given\nwas--\"We have not orders enough to keep in work the forge-hammers we\nalready have, and we do not desire at present to add any new ones,\nhowever improved.\"  At that time no patent had been taken out for the\ninvention.  Mr. Nasmyth had not yet saved money enough to enable him to\ndo so on his own account; and his partner declined to spend money upon\na tool that no engineer would give the firm an order for.  No secret\nwas made of the invention, and, excepting to its owner, it did not seem\nto be worth one farthing.\n\nSuch was the unpromising state of affairs, when M. Schneider, of the\nCreusot Iron Works in France, called at the Patricroft works together\nwith his practical mechanic M. Bourdon, for the purpose of ordering\nsome tools of the firm.  Mr. Nasmyth was absent on a journey at the\ntime, but his partner, Mr. Gaskell, as an act of courtesy to the\nstrangers, took the opportunity of showing them all that was new and\ninteresting in regard to mechanism about the works.  And among other\nthings, Mr. Gaskell brought out his partner's sketch or \"Scheme book,\"\nwhich lay in a drawer in the office, and showed them the design of the\nSteam Hammer, which no English firm would adopt.  They were much struck\nwith its simplicity and practical utility; and M.  Bourdon took careful\nnote of its arrangements.  Mr. Nasmyth on his return was informed of\nthe visit of MM. Schneider and Bourdon, but the circumstance of their\nhaving inspected the design of his steam-hammer seems to have been\nregarded by his partner as too trivial a matter to be repeated to him;\nand he knew nothing of the circumstance until his visit to France in\nApril, 1840.  When passing through the works at Creusot with M.\nBourdon, Mr. Nasmyth saw a crank shaft of unusual size, not only forged\nin the piece, but punched.  He immediately asked, \"How did you forge\nthat shaft?\"  M. Bourdon's answer was, \"Why, with your hammer, to be\nsure!\"  Great indeed was Nasmyth's surprise; for he had never yet seen\nthe hammer, except in his own drawing!  A little explanation soon\ncleared all up.  M. Bourdon said he had been so much struck with the\ningenuity and simplicity of the arrangement, that he had no sooner\nreturned than he set to work, and had a hammer made in general\naccordance with the design Mr. Gaskell had shown him; and that its\nperformances had answered his every expectation.  He then took Mr.\nNasmyth to see the steam-hammer; and great was his delight at seeing\nthe child of his brain in full and active work.  It was not, according\nto Mr. Nasmyth's ideas, quite perfect, and he readily suggested several\nimprovements, conformable with the original design, which M. Bourdon\nforthwith adopted.\n\nOn reaching England, Mr. Nasmyth at once wrote to his partner telling\nhim what he had seen, and urging that the taking out of a patent for\nthe protection of the invention ought no longer to be deferred.  But\ntrade was still very much depressed, and as the Patricroft firm needed\nall their capital to carry on their business, Mr. Gaskell objected to\nlock any of it up in engineering novelties.  Seeing himself on the\nbrink of losing his property in the invention, Mr. Nasmyth applied to\nhis brother-in-law, William Bennett, Esq., who advanced him the\nrequisite money for the purpose--about 280L.,--and the patent was\nsecured in June 1840.  The first hammer, of 30 cwt., was made for the\nPatricroft works, with the consent of the partners; and in the course\nof a few weeks it was in full work.  The precision and beauty of its\naction--the perfect ease with which it was managed, and the untiring\nforce of its percussive blows--were the admiration of all who saw it;\nand from that moment the steam-hammer became a recognised power in\nmodern mechanics.  The variety or gradation of its blows was such, that\nit was found practicable to manipulate a hammer of ten tons as easily\nas if it had only been of ten ounces weight.  It was under such\ncomplete control that while descending with its greatest momentum, it\ncould be arrested at any point with even greater ease than any\ninstrument used by hand.  While capable of forging an Armstrong\nhundred-pounder, or the sheet-anchor for a ship of the line, it could\nhammer a nail, or crack a nut without bruising the kernel.  When it\ncame into general use, the facilities which it afforded for executing\nall kinds of forging had the effect of greatly increasing the quantity\nof work done, at the same time that expense was saved.  The cost of\nmaking anchors was reduced by at least 50 per cent., while the quality\nof the forging was improved.  Before its invention the manufacture of a\nshaft of 15 or 20 cwt. required the concentrated exertions of a large\nestablishment, and its successful execution was regarded as a great\ntriumph of skill; whereas forgings of 20 and 30 tons weight are now\nthings of almost every-day occurrence.  Its advantages were so obvious,\nthat its adoption soon became general, and in the course of a few years\nNasmyth steam-hammers were to be found in every well-appointed workshop\nboth at home and abroad.  Many modifications have been made in the\ntool, by Condie, Morrison, Naylor, Rigby, and others; but Nasmyth's was\nthe father of them all, and still holds its ground.[5]\n\nAmong the important uses to which this hammer has of late years been\napplied, is the manufacture of iron plates for covering our ships of\nwar, and the fabrication of the immense wrought-iron ordnance of\nArmstrong, Whitworth, and Blakely.  But for the steam-hammer, indeed,\nit is doubtful whether such weapons could have been made.  It is also\nused for the re-manufacture of iron in various other forms, to say\nnothing of the greatly extended use which it has been the direct means\nof effecting in wrought-iron and steel forgings in every description of\nmachinery, from the largest marine steam-engines to the most nice and\ndelicate parts of textile mechanism.  \"It is not too much to say,\"\nobserves a writer in the Engineer, \"that, without Nasmyth's\nsteam-hammer, we must have stopped short in many of those gigantic\nengineering works which, but for the decay of all wonder in us, would\nbe the perpetual wonder of this age, and which have enabled our modern\nengineers to take rank above the gods of all mythologies.  There is one\nuse to which the steam-hammer is now becoming extensively applied by\nsome of our manufacturers that deserves especial mention, rather for\nthe prospect which it opens to us than for what has already been\nactually accomplished.  We allude to the manufacture of large articles\nin DIES.  At one manufactory in the country, railway wheels, for\nexample, are being manufactured with enormous economy by this means.\nThe various parts of the wheels are produced in quantity either by\nrolling or by dies under the hammer; these parts are brought together\nin their relative positions in a mould, heated to a welding heat, and\nthen by a blow of the steam hammer, furnished with dies, are stamped\ninto a complete and all but finished wheel.  It is evident that\nwherever wrought-iron articles of a manageable size have to be produced\nin considerable quantities, the same process may be adopted, and the\nsaving effected by the substitution of this for the ordinary forging\nprocess will doubtless ere long prove incalculable.  For this, as for\nthe many other advantageous uses of the steam-hammer, we are primarily\nand mainly indebted to Mr. Nasmyth.  It is but right, therefore, that\nwe should hold his name in honour.  In fact, when we think of the\nuniversal service which this machine is rendering us, we feel that some\nspecial expression of our indebtedness to him would be a reasonable and\ngrateful service.  The benefit which he has conferred upon us is so\ngreat as to justly entitle him to stand side by side with the few men\nwho have gained name and fame as great inventive engineers, and to whom\nwe have testified our gratitude--usually, unhappily, when it was too\nlate for them to enjoy it.\"\n\nMr. Nasmyth subsequently applied the principle of the steam-hammer in\nthe pile driver, which he invented in 1845.  Until its production, all\npiles had been driven by means of a small mass of iron falling upon the\nhead of the pile with great velocity from a considerable height,--the\nraising of the iron mass by means of the \"monkey\" being an operation\nthat occupied much time and labour, with which the results were very\nincommensurate.  Pile-driving was, in Mr. Nasmyth's words, conducted on\nthe artillery or cannon-ball principle; the action being excessive and\nthe mass deficient, and adapted rather for destructive than impulsive\naction.  In his new and beautiful machine, he applied the elastic force\nof steam in raising the ram or driving block, on which, the block being\ndisengaged, its whole weight of three tons descended on the head of the\npile, and the process being repeated eighty times in the minute, the\npile was sent home with a rapidity that was quite marvellous compared\nwith the old-fashioned system.  In forming coffer-dams for the piers\nand abutments of bridges, quays, and harbours, and in piling the\nfoundations of all kinds of masonry, the steam pile driver was found of\ninvaluable use by the engineer.  At the first experiment made with the\nmachine, Mr. Nasmyth drove a 14-inch pile fifteen feet into hard ground\nat the rate of 65 blows a minute.  The driver was first used in forming\nthe great steam dock at Devonport, where the results were very\nstriking; and it was shortly after employed by Robert Stephenson in\npiling the foundations of the great High Level Bridge at Newcastle, and\nthe Border Bridge at Berwick, as well as in several other of his great\nworks.  The saving of time effected by this machine was very\nremarkable, the ratio being as 1 to 1800; that is, a pile could be\ndriven in four minutes that before required twelve hours.  One of the\npeculiar features of the invention was that of employing the pile\nitself as the support of the steam-hammer part of the apparatus while\nit was being driven, so that the pile had the percussive action of the\ndead weight of the hammer as well as its lively blows to induce it to\nsink into the ground.  The steam-hammer sat as it were on the shoulders\nof the pile, while it dealt forth its ponderous blows on the pile-head\nat the rate of 80 a minute, and as the pile sank, the hammer followed\nit down with never relaxing activity until it was driven home to the\nrequired depth.  One of the most ingenious contrivances employed in the\ndriver, which was also adopted in the hammer, was the use of steam as a\nbuffer in the upper part of the cylinder, which had the effect of a\nrecoil spring, and greatly enhanced the force of the downward blow.\n\nIn 1846, Mr. Nasmyth designed a form of steam-engine after that of his\nsteam-hammer, which has been extensively adopted all over the world for\nscrew-ships of all sizes.  The pyramidal form of this engine, its great\nsimplicity and GET-AT-ABILITY of parts, together with the circumstance\nthat all the weighty parts of the engine are kept low, have rendered it\na universal favourite.  Among the other labour-saving tools invented by\nMr. Nasmyth, may be mentioned the well-known planing machine for small\nwork, called \"Nasmyth's Steam Arm,\" now used in every large workshop.\nIt was contrived for the purpose of executing a large order for\nlocomotives received from the Great Western Railway, and was found of\ngreat use in accelerating the work, especially in planing the links,\nlevers, connecting rods, and smaller kinds of wrought-iron work in\nthose engines.  His circular cutter for toothed wheels was another of\nhis handy inventions, which shortly came into general use.  In\niron-founding also he introduced a valuable practical improvement.  The\nold mode of pouring the molten metal into the moulds was by means of a\nlarge ladle with one or two cross handles and levers; but many dreadful\naccidents occurred through a slip of the hand, and Mr. Nasmyth\nresolved, if possible, to prevent them.  The plan he adopted was to fix\na worm-wheel on the side of the ladle, into which a worm was geared,\nand by this simple contrivance one man was enabled to move the largest\nladle on its axis with perfect ease and safety.  By this means the work\nwas more promptly performed, and accidents entirely avoided.\n\nMr. Nasmyth's skill in invention was backed by great energy and a large\nfund of common sense--qualities not often found united.  These proved\nof much service to the concern of which he was the head, and indeed\nconstituted the vital force.  The firm prospered as it deserved; and\nthey executed orders not only for England, but for most countries in\nthe civilized world.  Mr. Nasmyth had the advantage of being trained in\na good school--that of Henry Maudslay--where he had not only learnt\nhandicraft under the eye of that great mechanic, but the art of\norganizing labour, and (what is of great value to an employer)\nknowledge of the characters of workmen.  Yet the Nasmyth firm were not\nwithout their troubles as respected the mechanics in their employment,\nand on one occasion they had to pass through the ordeal of a very\nformidable strike.  The manner in which the inventor of the\nsteam-hammer literally \"Scotched\" this strike was very characteristic.\n\nA clever young man employed by the firm as a brass founder, being found\nto have a peculiar capacity for skilled mechanical work, had been\nadvanced to the lathe.  The other men objected to his being so employed\non the ground that it was against the rules of the trade.  \"But he is a\nfirst-rate workman,\" replied the employers, \"and we think it right to\nadvance a man according to his conduct and his merits.\"  \"No matter,\"\nsaid the workmen, \"it is against the rules, and if you do not take the\nman from the lathe, we must turn out.\"  \"Very well; we hold to our\nright of selecting the best men for the best places, and we will not\ntake the man from the lathe.\"  The consequence was a general turn out.\nPickets were set about the works, and any stray men who went thither to\nseek employment were waylaid, and if not induced to turn back, were\nmaltreated or annoyed until they were glad to leave.  The works were\nalmost at a standstill.  This state of things could not be allowed to\ngo on, and the head of the firm bestirred himself accordingly with his\nusual energy.  He went down to Scotland, searched all the best\nmechanical workshops there, and after a time succeeded in engaging\nsixty-four good hands.  He forbade them coming by driblets, but held\nthem together until there was a full freight; and then they came, with\ntheir wives, families, chests of drawers, and eight-day clocks, in a\nsteamboat specially hired for their transport from Greenock to\nLiverpool.  From thence they came by special train to Patricroft, where\nhouses were in readiness for their reception.  The arrival of so\nnumerous, well-dressed, and respectable a corps of workmen and their\nfamilies was an event in the neighbourhood, and could not fail to\nstrike the \"pickets\" with surprise.  Next morning the sixty-four\nScotchmen assembled in the yard at Patricroft, and after giving \"three\ncheers,\" went quietly to their work.  The \"picketing\" went on for a\nlittle while longer, but it was of no use against a body of strong men\nwho stood \"shouther to shouther,\" as the new hands did.  It was even\nbruited about that there were more trains to follow!  It very soon\nbecame clear that the back of the strike was broken.  The men returned\nto their work, and the clever brass founder continued at his\nturning-lathe, from which he speedily rose to still higher employment.\n\nNotwithstanding the losses and suffering occasioned by strikes, Mr.\nNasmyth holds the opinion that they have on the whole produced much\nmore good than evil.  They have served to stimulate invention in an\nextraordinary degree.  Some of the most important labour-saving\nprocesses now in common use are directly traceable to them.  In the\ncase of many of our most potent self-acting tools and machines,\nmanufacturers could not be induced to adopt them until compelled to do\nso by strikes.  This was the ease with the self-acting mule, the\nwool-combing machine, the planing machine, the slotting machine,\nNasmyth's steam arm, and many others.  Thus, even in the mechanical\nworld, there may be \"a soul of goodness in things evil.\"\n\nMr. Nasmyth retired from business in December, 1856.  He had the moral\ncourage to come out of the groove which he had so laboriously made for\nhimself, and to leave a large and prosperous business, saying, \"I have\nnow enough of this world's goods; let younger men have their chance.\"\nHe settled down at his rural retreat in Kent, but not to lead a life of\nidle ease.  Industry had become his habit, and active occupation was\nnecessary to his happiness.  He fell back upon the cultivation of those\nartistic tastes which are the heritage of his family.  When a boy at\nthe High School of Edinburgh, he was so skilful in making pen and ink\nillustrations on the margins of the classics, that he thus often\npurchased from his monitors exemption from the lessons of the day.  Nor\nhad he ceased to cultivate the art during his residence at Patricroft,\nbut was accustomed to fall back upon it for relaxation and enjoyment\namid the pursuits of trade.  That he possesses remarkable fertility of\nimagination, and great skill in architectural and landscape drawing, as\nwell as in the much more difficult art of delineating the human figure,\nwill be obvious to any one who has seen his works,--more particularly\nhis \"City of St.  Ann's,\" \"The Fairies,\" and \"Everybody for ever!\"\nwhich last was exhibited in Pall Mail, among the recent collection of\nworks of Art by amateurs and others, for relief of the Lancashire\ndistress.  He has also brought his common sense to bear on such\nunlikely subject's as the origin of the cuneiform character.  The\npossession of a brick from Babylon set him a thinking.  How had it been\nmanufactured? Its under side was clearly marked by the sedges of the\nEuphrates upon which it had been laid to dry and bake in the sun.  But\nhow about those curious cuneiform characters? How had writing assumed\nso remarkable a form?  His surmise was this:  that the brickmakers, in\ntelling their tale of bricks, used the triangular corner of another\nbrick, and by pressing it down upon the soft clay, left behind it the\ntriangular mark which the cuneiform character exhibits.  Such marks\nrepeated, and placed in different relations to each other, would\nreadily represent any number.  From the use of the corner of a brick in\nwriting, the transition was easy to a pointed stick with a triangular\nend, by the use of which all the cuneiform characters can readily be\nproduced upon the soft clay.  This curious question formed the subject\nof an interesting paper read by Mr. Nasmyth before the British\nAssociation at Cheltenham.\n\nBut the most engrossing of Mr. Nasmyth's later pursuits has been the\nscience of astronomy, in which, by bringing a fresh, original mind to\nthe observation of celestial phenomena, he has succeeded in making some\nof the most remarkable discoveries of our time.  Astronomy was one of\nhis favourite pursuits at Patricroft, and on his retirement became his\nserious study.  By repeated observations with a powerful reflecting\ntelescope of his own construction, he succeeded in making a very\ncareful and minute painting of the craters, cracks, mountains, and\nvalleys in the moon's surface, for which a Council Medal was awarded\nhim at the Great Exhibition of 1851.  But the most striking discovery\nwhich he has made by means of big telescope--the result of patient,\ncontinuous, and energetic observation--has been that of the nature of\nthe sun's surface, and the character of the extraordinary light-giving\nbodies, apparently possessed of voluntary motion, moving across it,\nsometimes forming spots or hollows of more than a hundred thousand\nmiles in diameter.\n\nThe results of these observations were of so novel a character that\nastronomers for some time hesitated to receive them as facts.[6]  Yet\nso eminent an astronomer as Sir John Herschel does not hesitate now to\ndescribe them as \"a most wonderful discovery.\"  \"According to Mr.\nNasmyth's observations,\" says he, \"made with a very fine telescope of\nhis own making, the bright surface of the sun consists of separate,\ninsulated, individual objects or things, all nearly or exactly of one\ncertain definite size and shape, which is more like that of a willow\nleaf, as he describes them, than anything else.  These leaves or scales\nare not arranged in any order (as those on a butterfly's wing are), but\nlie crossing one another in all directions, like what are called spills\nin the game of spillikins; except at the borders of a spot, where they\npoint for the most part inwards towards the middle of the spot,[7]\npresenting much the sort of appearance that the small leaves of some\nwater-plants or sea-weeds do at the edge of a deep hole of clear water.\nThe exceedingly definite shape of these objects, their exact similarity\none to another, and the way in which they lie across and athwart each\nother (except where they form a sort of bridge across a spot, in which\ncase they seem to affect a common direction, that, namely, of the\nbridge itself),--all these characters seem quite repugnant to the\nnotion of their being of a vaporous, a cloudy, or a fluid nature.\nNothing remains but to consider them as separate and independent\nsheets, flakes, or scales, having some sort of solidity.  And these\nflakes, be they what they may, and whatever may be said about the\ndashing of meteoric stones into the sun's atmosphere, &c., are\nevidently THE IMMEDIATE SOURCES OF THE SOLAR LIGHT AND HEAT, by\nwhatever mechanism or whatever processes they may be enabled to\ndevelope and, as it were, elaborate these elements from the bosom of\nthe non-luminous fluid in which they appear to float.  Looked at in\nthis point of view, we cannot refuse to regard them as organisms of\nsome peculiar and amazing kind; and though it would be too daring to\nspeak of such organization as partaking of the nature of life, yet we\ndo know that vital action is competent to develop heat and light, as\nwell as electricity.  These wonderful objects have been seen by others\nas well as Mr. Nasmyth, so that them is no room to doubt of their\nreality.\" [8]\n\nSuch is the marvellous discovery made by the inventor of the\nsteam-hammer, as described by the most distinguished astronomer of the\nage.  A writer in the Edinburgh Review, referring to the subject in a\nrecent number, says it shows him \"to possess an intellect as profound\nas it is expert.\"  Doubtless his training as a mechanic, his habits of\nclose observation and his ready inventiveness, which conferred so much\npower on him as an engineer, proved of equal advantage to him when\nlabouring in the domain of physical science.  Bringing a fresh mind, of\nkeen perception, to his new studies, and uninfluenced by preconceived\nopinions, he saw them in new and original lights; and hence the\nextraordinary discovery above described by Sir John Herschel.\n\nSome two hundred years since, a member of the Nasmyth family, Jean\nNasmyth of Hamilton, was burnt for a witch--one of the last martyrs to\nignorance and superstition in Scotland--because she read her Bible with\ntwo pairs of spectacles.  Had Mr. Nasmyth himself lived then, he might,\nwith his two telescopes of his own making, which bring the sun and moon\ninto his chamber for him to examine and paint, have been taken for a\nsorcerer.  But fortunately for him, and still more so for us, Mr.\nNasmyth stands before the public of this age as not only one of its\nablest mechanics, but as one of the most accomplished and original of\nscientific observers.\n\n\n\n[1] Originally prepared for John Hick, Esq., C.E., of Bolton, and\nembodied by him in his lectures on \"Self Help,\" delivered before the\nHoly Trinity Working Men's Association of that town, on the 18th and\n20th March, 1862; the account having been kindly corrected by Mr.\nNasmyth for the present publication.\n\n[2] Most of the tools with which he began business in Manchester were\nmade by his own hands in his father's little workshop at Edinburgh, He\nwas on one occasion \"hard up\" for brass with which to make a wheel for\nhis planing machine.  There was a row of old-fashioned brass\ncandlesticks standing in bright array on the kitchen mantelpiece which\nhe greatly coveted for the purpose.  His father was reluctant to give\nthem up; \"for,\" said he, \"I have had many a crack with Burns when these\ncandlesticks were on the table.\"  But his mother at length yielded;\nwhen the candlesticks were at once recast, and made into the wheel of\nthe planing machine, which is still at work in Manchester.\n\n[3] Cyclopaedia of Useful Arts, ii. 739.\n\n[4] Matsys' beautiful wrought-iron well cover, still standing in front\nof the cathedral at Antwerp, and Rukers's steel or iron chair exhibited\nat South Kensington in 1862, are examples of the beautiful hammer work\nturned out by the artisans of the middle ages.  The railings of the\ntombs of Henry VII. and Queen Eleanor in Westminster Abbey, the hinges\nand iron work of Lincoln Cathedral, of St.  George's Chapel at Windsor,\nand of some of the Oxford colleges, afford equally striking\nillustrations of the skill of our English blacksmiths several centuries\nago.\n\n[5] Mr. Nasmyth has lately introduced, with the assistance of Mr.\nWilson of the Low Moor Iron Works, a new, exceedingly ingenious, and\nvery simple contrivance for working the hammer.  By this application\nany length of stroke, any amount of blow, and any amount of variation\ncan be given by the operation of a single lever; and by this\nimprovement the machine has attained a rapidity of action and change of\nmotion suitable to the powers of the engine, and the form or\nconsistency of the articles under the hammer.--Mr. FAIRBAIRN'S Report\non the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1855, p. 100.\n\n[6] See Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of\nManchester, 3rd series, vol. 1. 407.\n\n[7] Sir John Herschel adds, \"Spots of not very irregular, and what may\nbe called compact form, covering an area of between seven and eight\nhundred millions of square miles, are by no means uncommon.  One spot\nwhich I measured in the year 1837 occupied no less than three thousand\nseven hundred and eighty millions, taking in all the irregularities of\nits form; and the black space or nucleus in the middle of one very\nnearly round one would have allowed the earth to drop through it,\nleaving a thousand clear miles on either side; and many instances of\nmuch larger spots than these are on record.\"\n\n[8] SIR JOHN HERSCHEL in Good Words for April, 1863.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nWILLIAM FAIRBAIRN.\n\n\"In science there is work for all hands, more or less skilled; and he\nis usually the most fit to occupy the higher posts who has risen from\nthe ranks, and has experimentally acquainted himself with the nature of\nthe work to be done in each and every, even the humblest department.\"\nJ. D. Forbes.\n\n\nThe development of the mechanical industry of England has been so\nrapid, especially as regards the wonders achieved by the machine-tools\nabove referred to, that it may almost be said to have been accomplished\nwithin the life of the present generation.  \"When I first entered this\ncity,\" said Mr. Fairbairn, in his inaugural address as President of the\nBritish Association at Manchester in 1861, \"the whole of the machinery\nwas executed by hand.  There were neither planing, slotting, nor\nshaping machines; and, with the exception of very imperfect lathes and\na few drills, the preparatory operations of construction were effected\nentirely by the hands of the workmen.  Now, everything is done by\nmachine-tools with a degree of accuracy which the unaided hand could\nnever accomplish.  The automaton or self-acting machine-tool has within\nitself an almost creative power; in fact, so great are its powers of\nadaptation, that there is no operation of the human hand that it does\nnot imitate.\"  In a letter to the author, Mr. Fairbairn says, \"The\ngreat pioneers of machine-tool-making were Maudslay, Murray of Leeds,\nClement and Fox of Derby, who were ably followed by Nasmyth, Roberts,\nand Whitworth, of Manchester, and Sir Peter Fairbairn of Leeds; and Mr.\nFairbairn might well have added, by himself,--for he has been one of\nthe most influential and successful of mechanical engineers.\n\nWilliam Fairbairn was born at Kelso on the 19th of February, 1787.  His\nparents occupied a humble but respectable position in life.  His\nfather, Andrew Fairbairn, was the son of a gardener in the employment\nof Mr. Baillie of Mellerston, and lived at Smailholm, a village lying a\nfew miles west of Kelso.  Tracing the Fairbairns still further back, we\nfind several of them occupying the station of \"portioners,\" or small\nlairds, at Earlston on the Tweed, where the family had been settled\nsince the days of the Solemn League and Covenant.  By his mother's\nside, the subject of our memoir is supposed to be descended from the\nancient Border family of Douglas.\n\nWhile Andrew Fairbairn (William's father) lived at Smailholm, Walter\nScott was living with his grandmother in Smailholm or Sandyknowe Tower,\nwhither he had been sent from Edinburgh in the hope that change of air\nwould help the cure of his diseased hip-joint; and Andrew, being nine\nyears his senior, and a strong youth for his age, was accustomed to\ncarry the little patient about in his arms, until he was able to walk\nby himself.  At a later period, when Miss Scott, Walter's aunt, removed\nfrom Smailholm to Kelso, the intercourse between the families was\nrenewed.  Scott was then an Edinburgh advocate, engaged in collecting\nmaterials for his Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, or, as his aunt\ndescribed his pursuit, \"running after the auld wives of the country\ngatherin' havers.\"  He used frequently to read over by the fireside in\nthe evening the results of his curious industry, which, however, were\nnot very greatly appreciated by his nearest relatives; and they did not\nscruple to declare that for the \"Advocate\" to go about collecting\n\"ballants\" was mere waste of time as well as money.\n\nWilliam Fairbairn's first schoolmaster was a decrepit old man who went\nby the name of \"Bowed Johnnie Ker,\"--a Cameronian, with a nasal twang,\nwhich his pupils learnt much more readily than they did his lessons in\nreading and arithmetic, notwithstanding a liberal use of \"the tawse.\"\nYet Johnnie had a taste for music, and taught his pupils to SING their\nreading lessons, which was reckoned quite a novelty in education.\nAfter a short time our scholar was transferred to the parish-school of\nthe town, kept by a Mr. White, where he was placed under the charge of\na rather severe helper, who, instead of the tawse, administered\ndiscipline by means of his knuckles, hard as horn, which he applied\nwith a peculiar jerk to the crania of his pupils.  At this school\nWillie Fairbairn lost the greater part of the singing accomplishments\nwhich he had acquired under \"Bowed Johnnie,\" but he learnt in lieu of\nthem to read from Scott and Barrow's collections of prose and poetry,\nwhile he obtained some knowledge of arithmetic, in which he proceeded\nas far as practice and the rule of three.  This constituted his whole\nstock of school-learning up to his tenth year.  Out of school-hours he\nlearnt to climb the ruined walls of the old abbey of the town, and\nthere was scarcely an arch, or tower, or cranny of it with which he did\nnot become familiar.\n\nWhen in his twelfth year, his father, who had been brought up to\nfarm-work, and possessed considerable practical knowledge of\nagriculture, was offered the charge of a farm at Moy in Ross-shire,\nbelonging to Lord Seaforth of Brahan Castle.  The farm was of about 300\nacres, situated on the banks of the river Conan, some five miles from\nthe town of Dingwall.  The family travelled thither in a covered cart,\na distance of 200 miles, through a very wild and hilly country,\narriving at their destination at the end of October, 1799.  The farm,\nwhen reached, was found overgrown with whins and brushwood, and covered\nin many places with great stones and rocks; it was, in short, as nearly\nin a state of nature as it was possible to be.  The house intended for\nthe farmer's reception was not finished, and Andrew Fairbairn, with his\nwife and five children, had to take temporary refuge in a miserable\nhovel, very unlike the comfortable house which they had quitted at\nKelso.  By next spring, however, the new house was ready; and Andrew\nFairbairn set vigorously to work at the reclamation of the land.  After\nabout two years' labours it exhibited an altogether different\nappearance, and in place of whins and stones there were to be seen\nheavy crops of barley and turnips.  The barren years of 1800 and 1801,\nhowever, pressed very hardly on Andrew Fairbairn as on every other\nfarmer of arable land.  About that time, Andrew's brother Peter, who\nacted as secretary to Lord Seaforth, and through whose influence the\nformer had obtained the farm, left Brahan Castle for the West Indies\nwith his Lordship, who--notwithstanding his being both deaf and\ndumb--had been appointed to the Governorship of Barbadoes; and in\nconsequence of various difficulties which occurred shortly after his\nleaving, Andrew Fairbairn found it necessary to give up his holding,\nwhereupon he engaged as steward to Mackenzie of Allengrange, with whom\nhe remained for two years.\n\nWhile the family lived at Moy, none of the boys were put to school.\nThey could not be spared from the farm and the household.  Those of\nthem that could not work afield were wanted to help to nurse the\nyounger children at home.  But Andrew Fairbairn possessed a great\ntreasure in his wife, who was a woman of much energy of character,\nsetting before her children an example of patient industry, thrift,\ndiscreetness, and piety, which could not fail to exercise a powerful\ninfluence upon them in after-life; and this, of itself, was an\neducation which probably far more than compensated for the boys' loss\nof school-culture during their life at Moy.  Mrs. Fairbairn span and\nmade all the children's clothes, as well as the blankets and sheeting;\nand, while in the Highlands, she not only made her own and her\ndaughters' dresses, and her sons' jackets and trowsers, but her\nhusband's coats and waistcoats; besides helping her neighbours to cut\nout their clothing for family wear.\n\nOne of William's duties at home was to nurse his younger brother Peter,\nthen a delicate child under two years old; and to relieve himself of\nthe labour of carrying him about, he began the construction of a little\nwaggon in which to wheel him.  This was, however, a work of some\ndifficulty, as all the tools he possessed were only a knife, a gimlet,\nand an old saw.  With these implements, a piece of thin board, and a\nfew nails, he nevertheless contrived to make a tolerably serviceable\nwaggon-body.  His chief difficulty consisted in making the wheels,\nwhich he contrived to surmount by cutting sections from the stem of a\nsmall alder-tree, and with a red-hot poker he bored the requisite holes\nin their centres to receive the axle.  The waggon was then mounted on\nits four wheels, and to the great joy of its maker was found to answer\nits purpose admirably.  In it he wheeled his little brother--afterwards\nwell known as Sir Peter Fairbairn, mayor of Leeds--in various\ndirections about the farm, and sometimes to a considerable distance\nfrom it; and the vehicle was regarded on the whole as a decided\nsuccess.  His father encouraged him in his little feats of construction\nof a similar kind, and he proceeded to make and rig miniature boats and\nships, and then miniature wind and water mills, in which last art he\nacquired such expertness that he had sometimes five or six mills going\nat a time.  The machinery was all made with a knife, the water-spouts\nbeing formed by the bark of a tree, and the millstones represented by\nround discs of the same material.  Such were the first constructive\nefforts of the future millwright and engineer.\n\nWhen the family removed to Allengrange in 1801, the boys were sent to\nschool at Munlachy, about a mile and a half distant from the farm.  The\nschool was attended by about forty barefooted boys in tartan kilt's,\nand about twenty girls, all of the poorer class.  The schoolmaster was\none Donald Frazer, a good teacher, but a severe disciplinarian.  Under\nhim, William made some progress in reading, writing, and arithmetic;\nand though he himself has often lamented the meagreness of his school\ninstruction, it is clear, from what he has since been enabled to\naccomplish, that these early lessons were enough at all events to set\nhim fairly on the road of self-culture, and proved the fruitful seed of\nmuch valuable intellectual labour, as well as of many excellent\npractical books.\n\nAfter two years' trial of his new situation, which was by no means\nsatisfactory, Andrew Fairbairn determined again to remove southward\nwith his family; and, selling off everything, they set sail from\nCromarty for Leith in June, 1803.  Having seen his wife and children\ntemporarily settled at Kelso, he looked out for a situation, and\nshortly after proceeded to undertake the management of Sir William\nIngleby's farm at Ripley in Yorkshire.  Meanwhile William was placed\nfor three months under the charge of his uncle William, the parish\nschoolmaster of Galashiels, for the purpose of receiving instruction in\nbook-keeping and land-surveying, from which he derived considerable\nbenefit.  He could not, however, remain longer at school; for being of\nthe age of fourteen, it was thought necessary that he should be set to\nwork without further delay.  His first employment was on the fine new\nbridge at Kelso, then in course of construction after the designs of\nMr. Rennie; but in helping one day to carry a handbarrow-load of stone,\nhis strength proving insufficient, he gave way under it, and the stones\nfell upon him, one of them inflicting a serious wound on his leg, which\nkept him a cripple for months.  In the mean time his father, being\ndissatisfied with his prospects at Ripley, accepted the appointment of\nmanager of the Percy Main Colliery Company's farm in the neighbourhood\nof Newcastle-on-Tyne, whither he proceeded with his family towards the\nend of 1803, William joining them in the following February, when the\nwound in his leg had sufficiently healed to enable him to travel.\n\nPercy Main is situated within two miles of North Shields, and is one of\nthe largest collieries in that district.  William was immediately set\nto work at the colliery, his first employment being to lead coals from\nbehind the screen to the pitmen's houses.  His Scotch accent, and\nperhaps his awkwardness, exposed him to much annoyance from the \"pit\nlads,\" who were a very rough and profligate set; and as boxing was a\nfavourite pastime among them, our youth had to fight his way to their\nrespect, passing through a campaign of no less than seventeen pitched\nbattles.  He was several times on the point of abandoning the work\naltogether, rather than undergo the buffetings and insults to which he\nwas almost a daily martyr, when a protracted contest with one of the\nnoted boxers of the colliery, in which he proved the victor, at length\nrelieved him from further persecution.\n\nIn the following year, at the age of sixteen, he was articled as an\nengineer for five years to the owners of Percy Main, and was placed\nunder the charge of Mr. Robinson, the engine-wright of the colliery.\nHis wages as apprentice were 8s. a week; but by working over-hours,\nmaking wooden wedges used in pit-work, and blocking out segments of\nsolid oak required for walling the sides of the mine, he considerably\nincreased his earnings, which enabled him to add to the gross income of\nthe family, who were still struggling with the difficulties of small\nmeans and increasing expenses.  When not engaged upon over-work in the\nevenings, he occupied himself in self-education.  He drew up a scheme\nof daily study with this object, to which he endeavoured to adhere as\nclosely as possible,--devoting the evenings of Mondays to mensuration\nand arithmetic; Tuesdays to history and poetry; Wednesdays to\nrecreation, novels, and romances; Thursdays to algebra and mathematics;\nFridays to Euclid and trigonometry; Saturdays to recreation; and\nSundays to church, Milton, and recreation.  He was enabled to extend\nthe range of his reading by the help of the North Shields Subscription\nLibrary, to which his father entered him a subscriber.  Portions of his\nspare time were also occasionally devoted to mechanical construction,\nin which he cultivated the useful art of handling tools.  One of his\nfirst attempts was the contrivance of a piece of machinery worked by a\nweight and a pendulum, that should at the same time serve for a\ntimepiece and an orrery; but his want of means, as well as of time,\nprevented him prosecuting this contrivance to completion.  He was more\nsuccessful with the construction of a fiddle, on which he was ambitious\nto become a performer.  It must have been a tolerable instrument, for a\nprofessional player offered him 20s. for it.  But though he succeeded\nin making a fiddle, and for some time persevered in the attempt to play\nupon it, he did not succeed in producing any satisfactory melody, and\nat length gave up the attempt, convinced that nature had not intended\nhim for a musician.[1]\n\nIn due course of time our young engineer was removed from the workshop,\nand appointed to take charge of the pumps of the mine and the\nsteam-engine by which they were kept in work.  This employment was more\nto his taste, gave him better \"insight,\" and afforded him greater\nopportunities for improvement.  The work was, however, very trying, and\nat times severe, especially in winter, the engineer being liable to be\ndrenched with water every time that he descended the shaft to regulate\nthe working of the pumps; but, thanks to a stout constitution, he bore\nthrough these exposures without injury, though others sank under them.\nAt this period he had the advantage of occasional days of leisure, to\nwhich he was entitled by reason of his nightwork; and during such\nleisure he usually applied himself to reading and study.\n\nIt was about this time that William Fairbairn made the acquaintance of\nGeorge Stephenson, while the latter was employed in working the\nballast-engine at Willington Quay.  He greatly admired George as a\nworkman, and was accustomed in the summer evenings to go over to the\nQuay occasionally and take charge of George's engine, to enable him to\nearn a few shillings extra by heaving ballast out of the collier\nvessels.  Stephenson's zeal in the pursuit of mechanical knowledge\nprobably was not without its influence in stimulating William Fairbairn\nhimself to carry on so diligently the work of self-culture.  But little\ncould the latter have dreamt, while serving his apprenticeship at Percy\nMain, that his friend George Stephenson, the brakesman, should yet be\nrecognised as among the greatest engineers of his age, and that he\nhimself should have the opportunity, in his capacity of President of\nthe Institute of Mechanical Engineers at Newcastle, of making public\nacknowledgment of the opportunities for education which he had enjoyed\nin that neighbourhood in his early years.[2]\n\nHaving finished his five years' apprenticeship at Percy Main, by which\ntime he had reached his twenty-first year, William Fairbairn shortly\nafter determined to go forth into the world in search of experience.\nAt Newcastle he found employment as a millwright for a few weeks,\nduring which he worked at the erection of a sawmill in the Close.  From\nthence he went to Bedlington at an advanced wage.  He remained there\nfor six months, during which he was so fortunate as to make the\nacquaintance of Miss Mar, who five years after, when his wanderings had\nceased, became his wife.  On the completion of the job on which he had\nbeen employed, our engineer prepared to make another change.  Work was\ndifficult to be had in the North, and, joined by a comrade, he resolved\nto try his fortune in London.  Adopting the cheapest route, he took\npassage by a Shields collier, in which he sailed for the Thames on the\n11th of December, 1811.  It was then war-time, and the vessel was very\nshort-handed, the crew consisting only of three old men and three boys,\nwith the skipper and mate; so that the vessel was no sooner fairly at\nsea than both the passenger youths had to lend a hand in working her,\nand this continued for the greater part of the voyage.  The weather was\nvery rough, and in consequence of the captain's anxiety to avoid\nprivateers he hugged the shore too close, and when navigating the\ninside passage of the Swin, between Yarmouth and the Nore, the vessel\nvery narrowly escaped shipwreck.  After beating about along shore, the\ncaptain half drunk the greater part of the time, the vessel at last\nreached the Thames with loss of spars and an anchor, after a tedious\nvoyage of fourteen days.\n\nOn arriving off Blackwall the captain went ashore ostensibly in search\nof the Coal Exchange, taking our young engineer with him.  The former\nwas still under the influence of drink; and though he failed to reach\nthe Exchange that night, he succeeded in reaching a public house in\nWapping, beyond which he could not be got.  At ten o'clock the two\nstarted on their return to the ship; but the captain took the\nopportunity of the darkness to separate from his companion, and did not\nreach the ship until next morning.  It afterwards came out that he had\nbeen taken up and lodged in the watch-house.  The youth, left alone in\nthe streets of the strange city, felt himself in an awkward dilemma.\nHe asked the next watchman he met to recommend him to a lodging, on\nwhich the man took him to a house in New Gravel Lane, where he\nsucceeded in finding accommodation.  What was his horror next morning\nto learn that a whole family--the Williamsons--had been murdered in the\nvery next house during the night!  Making the best of his way back to\nthe ship, he found that his comrade, who had suffered dreadfully from\nsea-sickness during the voyage, had nearly recovered, and was able to\naccompany him into the City in search of work.  They had between them a\nsum of only about eight pounds, so that it was necessary for them to\ntake immediate steps to obtain employment.\n\nThey thought themselves fortunate in getting the promise of a job from\nMr. Rennie, the celebrated engineer, whose works were situated at the\nsouth end of Blackfriars Bridge.  Mr. Rennie sent the two young men to\nhis foreman, with the request that he should set them to work.  The\nforeman referred them to the secretary of the Millwrights' Society, the\nshop being filled with Union men, who set their shoulders together to\nexclude those of their own grade, however skilled, who could not\nproduce evidence that they had complied with the rules of the trade.\nDescribing his first experience of London Unionists, nearly half a\ncentury later, before an assembly of working men at Derby, Mr.\nFairbairn said, \"When I first entered London, a young man from the\ncountry had no chance whatever of success, in consequence of the trade\nguilds and unions.  I had no difficulty in finding employment, but\nbefore I could begin work I had to run the gauntlet of the trade\nsocieties; and after dancing attendance for nearly six weeks, with very\nlittle money in my pocket, and having to 'box Harry' all the time, I\nwas ultimately declared illegitimate, and sent adrift to seek my\nfortune elsewhere.  There were then three millwright societies in\nLondon:  one called the Old Society, another the New Society, and a\nthird the Independent Society.  These societies were not founded for\nthe protection of the trade, but for the maintenance of high wages, and\nfor the exclusion of all those who could not assert their claims to\nwork in London and other corporate towns.  Laws of a most arbitrary\ncharacter were enforced, and they were governed by cliques of\nself-appointed officers, who never failed to take care of their own\ninterests.\" [3]\n\nTheir first application for leave to work in London having thus\ndisastrously ended, the two youths determined to try their fortune in\nthe country, and with aching hearts they started next morning before\ndaylight.  Their hopes had been suddenly crushed, their slender funds\nwere nearly exhausted, and they scarce knew where to turn.  But they\nset their faces bravely northward, and pushed along the high road,\nthrough slush and snow, as far as Hertford, which they reached after\nnearly eight hours' walking, on the moderate fare during their journey\nof a penny roll and a pint of ale each.  Though wet to the skin, they\nimmediately sought out a master millwright, and applied for work.  He\nsaid he had no job vacant at present; but, seeing their sorry plight,\nhe had compassion upon them, and said, \"Though I cannot give you\nemployment, you seem to be two nice lads;\" and he concluded by offering\nFairbairn a half-crown.  But his proud spirit revolted at taking money\nwhich he had not earned; and he declined the proffered gift with\nthanks, saying he was sorry they could not have work.  He then turned\naway from the door, on which his companion, mortified by his refusal to\naccept the half-crown at a time when they were reduced almost to their\nlast penny, broke out in bitter remonstrances and regrets.  Weary, wet,\nand disheartened, the two turned into Hertford churchyard, and rested\nfor a while upon a tombstone, Fairbairn's companion relieving himself\nby a good cry, and occasional angry outbursts of \"Why didn't you take\nthe half-crown?\"  \"Come, come, man!\" said Fairbairn, \"it's of no use\ncrying; cheer up; let's try another road; something must soon cast up.\"\nThey rose, and set out again, but when they reached the bridge, the\ndispirited youth again broke down; and, leaning his back against the\nparapet, said, \"I winna gang a bit further; let's get back to London.\"\nAgainst this Fairbairn remonstrated, saying \"It's of no use lamenting;\nwe must try what we can do here; if the worst comes to the worst, we\ncan 'list; you are a strong chap--they'll soon take you; and as for me,\nI'll join too; I think I could fight a bit.\"  After this council of\nwar, the pair determined to find lodgings in the town for the night,\nand begin their search for work anew on the morrow.\n\nNext day, when passing along one of the back streets of Hertford, they\ncame to a wheelwright's shop, where they made the usual enquiries.  The\nwheelwright, said that he did not think there was any job to be had in\nthe town; but if the two young men pushed on to Cheshunt, he thought\nthey might find work at a windmill which was under contract to be\nfinished in three weeks, and where the millwright wanted hands.  Here\nwas a glimpse of hope at last; and the strength and spirits of both\nrevived in an instant.  They set out immediately; walked the seven\nmiles to Cheshunt; succeeded in obtaining the expected employment;\nworked at the job a fortnight; and entered London again with nearly\nthree pounds in their pockets.\n\nOur young millwright at length succeeded in obtaining regular\nemployment in the metropolis at good wages.  He worked first at\nGrundy's Patent Ropery at Shadwell, and afterwards at Mr. Penn's of\nGreenwich, gaining much valuable insight, and sedulously improving his\nmind by study in his leisure hours.  Among the acquaintances he then\nmade was an enthusiastic projector of the name of Hall, who had taken\nout one patent for making hemp from bean-stalks, and contemplated\ntaking out another for effecting spade tillage by steam.  The young\nengineer was invited to make the requisite model, which he did, and it\ncost him both time and money, which the out-at-elbows projector was\nunable to repay; and all that came of the project was the exhibition of\nthe model at the Society of Arts and before the Board of Agriculture,\nin whose collection it is probably still to be found.  Another more\nsuccessful machine constructed By Mr. Fairbairn about the same time was\na sausage-chopping machine, which he contrived and made for a\npork-butcher for 33l.  It was the first order he had ever had on his\nown account; and, as the machine when made did its work admirably, he\nwas naturally very proud of it.  The machine was provided with a\nfly-wheel and double crank, with connecting rods which worked a cross\nhead.  It contained a dozen knives crossing each other at right angles\nin such a way as to enable them to mince or divide the meat on a\nrevolving block.  Another part of the apparatus accomplished the\nfilling of the sausages in a very expert manner, to the entire\nsatisfaction of the pork-butcher.\n\nAs work was scarce in London at the time, and our engineer was bent on\ngathering further experience in his trade, he determined to make a tour\nin the South of England and South Wales; and set out from London in\nApril 1813 with 7L. in his pocket.  After visiting Bath and Frome, he\nsettled to work for six weeks at Bathgate; after which he travelled by\nBradford and Trowbridge--always on foot--to Bristol.  From thence he\ntravelled through South Wales, spending a few days each at Newport,\nLlandaff, and Cardiff, where he took ship for Dublin.  By the time he\nreached Ireland his means were all but exhausted, only three-halfpence\nremaining in his pocket; but, being young, hopeful, skilful, and\nindustrious, he was light of heart, and looked cheerfully forward.  The\nnext day he succeeded in finding employment at Mr. Robinson's, of the\nPhoenix Foundry, where he was put to work at once upon a set of\npatterns for some nail-machinery.  Mr. Robinson was a man of spirit and\nenterprise, and, seeing the quantities of English machine-made nails\nimported into Ireland, he was desirous of giving Irish industry the\nbenefit of the manufacture.  The construction of the nail-making\nmachinery occupied Mr. Fairbairn the entire summer; and on its\ncompletion he set sail in the month of October for Liverpool.  It may\nbe added, that, notwithstanding the expense incurred by Mr. Robinson in\nsetting up the new nail-machinery, his workmen threatened him with a\nstrike if he ventured to use it.  As he could not brave the opposition\nof the Unionists, then all-powerful in Dublin, the machinery was never\nset to work; the nail-making trade left Ireland, never to return; and\nthe Irish market was thenceforward supplied entirely with English-made\nnails.  The Dublin iron-manufacture was ruined in the same way; not\nthrough any local disadvantages, but solely by the prohibitory\nregulations enforced by the workmen of the Trades Unions.\n\nArrived at Liverpool, after a voyage of two days--which was then\nconsidered a fair passage--our engineer proceeded to Manchester, which\nhad already become the principal centre of manufacturing operations in\nthe North of England.  As we have already seen in the memoirs of\nNasmyth, Roberts, and Whitworth, Manchester offered great attractions\nfor highly-skilled mechanics; and it was as fortunate for Manchester as\nfor William Fairbairn himself that he settled down there as a working\nmillwright in the year 1814, bringing with him no capital, but an\nabundance of energy, skill, and practical experience in his trade.\nAfterwards describing the characteristics of the millwright of that\ntime, Mr. Fairbairn said--\"In those days a good millwright was a man of\nlarge resources; he was generally well educated, and could draw out his\nown designs and work at the lathe; he had a knowledge of mill\nmachinery, pumps, and cranes, and could turn his hand to the bench or\nthe forge with equal adroitness and facility.  If hard pressed, as was\nfrequently the case in country places far from towns, he could devise\nfor himself expedients which enabled him to meet special requirements,\nand to complete his work without assistance.  This was the class of men\nwith whom I associated in early life--proud of their calling, fertile\nin resources, and aware of their value in a country where the\nindustrial arts were rapidly developing.\" [4]\n\nWhen William Fairbairn entered Manchester he was twenty-four years of\nage; and his hat still \"covered his family.\"  But, being now pretty\nwell satiated with his \"wandetschaft,\"--as German tradesmen term their\nstage of travelling in search of trade experience,--he desired to\nsettle, and, if fortune favoured him, to marry the object of his\naffections, to whom his heart still faithfully turned during all his\nwanderings.  He succeeded in finding employment with Mr. Adam\nParkinson, remaining with him for two years, working as a millwright,\nat good wages.  Out of his earnings he saved sufficient to furnish a\ntwo-roomed cottage comfortably; and there we find him fairly installed\nwith his wife by the end of 1816.  As in the case of most men of a\nthoughtful turn, marriage served not only to settle our engineer, but\nto stimulate him to more energetic action.  He now began to aim at\ntaking a higher position, and entertained the ambition of beginning\nbusiness on his own account.  One of his first efforts in this\ndirection was the preparation of the design of a cast-iron bridge over\nthe Irwell, at Blackfriars, for which a prize was offered.  The attempt\nwas unsuccessful, and a stone bridge was eventually decided on; but the\neffort made was creditable, and proved the beginning of many designs.\nThe first job he executed on his own account was the erection of an\niron conservatory and hothouse for Mr. J. Hulme, of Clayton, near\nManchester; and he induced one of his shopmates, James Lillie, to join\nhim in the undertaking.  This proved the beginning of a business\nconnection which lasted for a period of fifteen years, and laid the\nfoundation of a partnership, the reputation of which, in connection\nwith mill-work and the construction of iron machinery generally,\neventually became known all over the civilized world.\n\nAlthough the patterns for the conservatory were all made, and the\ncastings were begun, the work was not proceeded with, in consequence of\nthe notice given by a Birmingham firm that the plan after which it was\nproposed to construct it was an infringement of their patent.  The\nyoung firm were consequently under the necessity of looking about them\nfor other employment.  And to be prepared for executing orders, they\nproceeded in the year 1817 to hire a small shed at a rent of 12s. a\nweek, in which they set up a lathe of their own making, capable of\nturning shafts of from 3 to 6 inches diameter; and they hired a strong\nIrishman to drive the wheel and assist at the heavy work.  Their first\njob was the erection of a cullender, and their next a calico-polishing\nmachine; but orders came in slowly, and James Lillie began to despair\nof success.  His more hopeful partner strenuously urged him to\nperseverance, and so buoyed him up with hopes of orders, that he\ndetermined to go on a little longer.  They then issued cards among the\nmanufacturers, and made a tour of the principal firms, offering their\nservices and soliciting work.\n\nAmongst others, Mr. Fairbairn called upon the Messrs. Adam and George\nMurray, the large cotton-spinners, taking with him the designs of his\niron bridge.  Mr. Adam Murray received him kindly, heard his\nexplanations, and invited him to call on the following day with his\npartner.  The manufacturer must have been favourably impressed by this\ninterview, for next day, when Fairbairn and Lillie called, he took them\nover his mill, and asked whether they felt themselves competent to\nrenew with horizontal cross-shafts the whole of the work by which the\nmule-spinning machinery was turned.  This was a formidable enterprise\nfor a young firm without capital and almost without plant to undertake;\nbut they had confidence in themselves, and boldly replied that they\nwere willing and able to execute the work.  On this, Mr. Murray said he\nwould call and see them at their own workshop, to satisfy himself that\nthey possessed the means of undertaking such an order.  This proposal\nwas by no means encouraging to the partners, who feared that when Mr.\nMurray spied \"the nakedness of the land\" in that quarter, he might\nrepent him of his generous intentions.  He paid his promised visit, and\nit is probable that he was more favourably impressed by the individual\nmerits of the partners than by the excellence of their\nmachine-tools--of which they had only one, the lathe which they had\njust made and set up; nevertheless he gave them the order, and they\nbegan with glad hearts and willing hands and minds to execute this\ntheir first contract.  It may be sufficient to state that by working\nlate and early--from 5 in the morning until 9 at night for a\nconsiderable period--they succeeded in completing the alterations\nwithin the time specified, and to Mr. Murray's entire satisfaction.\nThe practical skill of the young men being thus proved, and their\nanxiety to execute the work entrusted to them to the best of their\nability having excited the admiration of their employer, he took the\nopportunity of recommending them to his friends in the trade, and\namongst others to Mr. John Kennedy, of the firm of MacConnel and\nKennedy, then the largest spinners in the kingdom.\n\nThe Cotton Trade had by this time sprung into great importance, and was\nincreasing with extraordinary rapidity.  Population and wealth were\npouring into South Lancashire, and industry and enterprise were\neverywhere on foot.  The foundations were being laid of a system of\nmanufacturing in iron, machinery, and textile fabrics of nearly all\nkinds, the like of which has perhaps never been surpassed in any\ncountry.  It was a race of industry, in which the prizes were won by\nthe swift, the strong, and the skilled.  For the most part, the early\nLancashire manufacturers started very nearly equal in point of worldly\ncircumstances, men originally of the smallest means often coming to the\nfront--work men, weavers, mechanics, pedlers, farmers, or labourers--in\ncourse of time rearing immense manufacturing concerns by sheer force of\nindustry, energy, and personal ability.  The description given by one\nof the largest employers in Lancashire, of the capital with which he\nstarted, might apply to many of them: \"When I married,\" said he, \"my\nwife had a spinning-wheel, and I had a loom--that was the beginning of\nour fortune.\"  As an illustration of the rapid rise of Manchester men\nfrom small beginnings, the following outline of John Kennedy's career,\nintimately connected as he was with the subject of our memoir--may not\nbe without interest in this place.\n\nJohn Kennedy was one of five young men of nearly the same age, who came\nfrom the same neighbourhood in Scotland, and eventually settled in\nManchester as cottons-pinners about the end of last century.  The\nothers were his brother James, his partner James MacConnel, and the\nbrothers Murray, above referred to--Mr. Fairbairn's first extensive\nemployers.  John Kennedy's parents were respectable peasants, possessed\nof a little bit of ground at Knocknalling, in the stewartry of\nKirkcudbright, on which they contrived to live, and that was all.  John\nwas one of a family of five sons and two daughters, and the father\ndying early, the responsibility and the toil of bringing up these\nchildren devolved upon the mother.  She was a strict disciplinarian,\nand early impressed upon the minds of her boys that they had their own\nway to make in the world.  One of the first things she made them think\nabout was, the learning of some useful trade for the purpose of\nsecuring an independent living; \"for,\" said she, \"if you have gotten\nmechanical skill and intelligence, and are honest and trustworthy, you\nwill always find employment and be ready to avail yourselves of\nopportunities for advancing yourselves in life.\"  Though the mother\ndesired to give her sons the benefits of school education, there was\nbut little of that commodity to be had in the remote district of\nKnocknalling.  The parish-school was six miles distant, and the\nteaching given in it was of a very inferior sort--usually administered\nby students, probationers for the ministry, or by half-fledged\ndominies, themselves more needing instruction than able to impart it.\nThe Kennedys could only attend the school during a few months in\nsummer-time, so that what they had acquired by the end of one season\nwas often forgotten by the beginning of the next.  They learnt,\nhowever, to read the Testament, say their catechism, and write their\nown names.\n\nAs the children grew up, they each longed for the time to come when\nthey could be put to a trade.  The family were poorly clad; stockings\nand shoes were luxuries rarely indulged in; and Mr. Kennedy used in\nafter-life to tell his grandchildren of a certain Sunday which he\nremembered shortly after his father died, when he was setting out for\nDalry church, and had borrowed his brother Alexander's stockings, his\nbrother ran after him and cried, \"See that you keep out of the dirt,\nfor mind you have got my stockings on!\"  John indulged in many\nday-dreams about the world that lay beyond the valley and the mountains\nwhich surrounded the place of his birth.  Though a mere boy, the\nnatural objects, eternally unchangeable, which daily met his eyes--the\nprofound silence of the scene, broken only by the bleating of a\nsolitary sheep, or the crowing of a distant cock, or the thrasher\nbeating out with his flail the scanty grain of the black oats spread\nupon a skin in the open air, or the streamlets leaping from the rocky\nclefts, or the distant church-bell sounding up the valley on\nSundays--all bred in his mind a profound melancholy and feeling of\nloneliness, and he used to think to himself, \"What can I do to see and\nknow something of the world beyond this?\"  The greatest pleasure he\nexperienced during that period was when packmen came round with their\nstores of clothing and hardware, and displayed them for sale; he\neagerly listened to all that such visitors had to tell of the ongoings\nof the world beyond the valley.\n\nThe people of the Knocknalling district were very poor.  The greater\npart of them were unable to support the younger members, whose custom\nit was to move off elsewhere in search of a living when they arrived at\nworking years,--some to America, some to the West Indies, and some to\nthe manufacturing districts of the south.  Whole families took their\ndeparture in this way, and the few friendships which Kennedy formed\namongst those of his own age were thus suddenly snapped, and only a\ngreat blank remained.  But he too could follow their example, and enter\nupon that wider world in which so many others had ventured and\nsucceeded.  As early as eight years of age, his mother still impressing\nupon her boys the necessity of learning to work, John gathered courage\nto say to her that he wished to leave home and apprentice himself to\nsome handicraft business.  Having seen some carpenters working in the\nneighbourhood, with good clothes on their backs, and hearing the men's\ncharacters well spoken of, he thought it would be a fine thing to be a\ncarpenter too, particularly as the occupation would enable him to move\nfrom place to place and see the world.  He was as yet, however, of too\ntender an age to set out on the journey of life; but when he was about\neleven years old, Adam Murray, one of his most intimate acquaintances,\nhaving gone off to serve an apprenticeship in Lancashire with Mr.\nCannan of Chowbent, himself a native of the district, the event again\nawakened in him a strong desire to migrate from Knocknalling.  Others\nhad gone after Murray, James MacConnel and two or three more; and at\nlength, at about fourteen years of age, Kennedy himself left his native\nhome for Lancashire.  About the time that he set out, Paul Jones was\nravaging the coasts of Galloway, and producing general consternation\nthroughout the district.  Great excitement also prevailed through the\noccurrence of the Gordon riots in London, which extended into remote\ncountry places; and Kennedy remembered being nearly frightened out of\nhis wits on one occasion by a poor dominie whose school he attended,\nwho preached to his boys about the horrors that were coming upon the\nland through the introduction of Popery.  The boy set out for England\non the 2nd of February, 1784, mounted upon a Galloway, his little\npackage of clothes and necessaries strapped behind him.  As he passed\nalong the glen, recognising each familiar spot, his heart was in his\nmouth, and he dared scarcely trust himself to look back.  The ground\nwas covered with snow, and nature quite frozen up.  He had the company\nof his brother Alexander as far as the town of New Galloway, where he\nslept the first night.  The next day, accompanied by one of his future\nmasters, Mr. James Smith, a partner of Mr. Cannan's, who had originally\nentered his service as a workman, they started on ponyback for\nDumfries.  After a long day's ride, they entered the town in the\nevening, and amongst the things which excited the boy's surprise were\nthe few street-lamps of the town, and a waggon with four horses and\nfour wheels.  In his remote valley carts were as yet unknown, and even\nin Dumfries itself they were comparative rarities; the common means of\ntransport in the district being what were called \"tumbling cars.\" The\nday after, they reached Longtown, and slept there; the boy noting\nANOTHER lamp.  The next stage was to Carlisle, where Mr. Smith, whose\nfirm had supplied a carding engine and spinning-jenny to a small\nmanufacturer in the town, went to \"gate\" and trim them.  One was put up\nin a small house, the other in a small room; and the sight of these\nmachines was John Kennedy's first introduction to cotton-spinning.\nWhile going up the inn-stairs he was amazed and not a little alarmed at\nseeing two men in armour--he had heard of the battles between the Scots\nand English--and believed these to be some of the fighting men; though\nthey proved to be but effigies.  Five more days were occupied in\ntravelling southward, the resting places being at Penrith, Kendal,\nPreston, and Chorley, the two travellers arriving at Chowbent on Sunday\nthe 8th of February, 1784.  Mr. Cannan seems to have collected about\nhim a little colony of Scotsmen, mostly from the same neighbourhood,\nand in the evening there was quite an assembly of them at the \"Bear's\nPaw,\" where Kennedy put up, to hear the tidings from their native\ncounty brought by the last new comer.  On the following morning the boy\nbegan his apprenticeship as a carpenter with the firm of Cannan and\nSmith, serving seven years for his meat and clothing.  He applied\nhimself to his trade, and became a good, steady workman.  He was\nthoughtful and self-improving, always endeavouring to acquire knowledge\nof new arts and to obtain insight into new machines.  \"Even in early\nlife,\" said he, in the account of his career addressed to his children,\n\"I felt a strong desire to know what others knew, and was always ready\nto communicate what little I knew myself; and by admitting at once my\nwant of education, I found that I often made friends of those on whom I\nhad no claims beyond what an ardent desire for knowledge could give me.\"\n\nHis apprenticeship over, John Kennedy commenced business[5] in a small\nway in Manchester in 1791, in conjunction with two other workmen,\nSandford and MacConnel.  Their business was machine-making and\nmule-spinning, Kennedy taking the direction of the machine department.\nThe firm at first put up their mules for spinning in any convenient\ngarrets they could hire at a low rental.  After some time, they took\npart of a small factory in Canal Street, and carried on their business\non a larger scale.  Kennedy and MacConnel afterwards occupied a little\nfactory in the same street,--since removed to give place to Fairbairn's\nlarge machine works.  The progress of the firm was steady and even\nrapid, and they went on building mills and extending their\nbusiness--Mr. Kennedy, as he advanced in life, gathering honour,\nwealth, and troops of friends.  Notwithstanding the defects of his\nearly education, he was one of the few men of his class who became\ndistinguished for his literary labours in connexion principally with\nthe cotton trade.  Towards the close of his life, he prepared several\npapers of great interest for the Literary and Philosophical Society of\nManchester, which are to be found printed in their Proceedings; one of\nthese, on the Invention of the Mule by Samuel Crompton, was for a long\ntime the only record which the public possessed of the merits and\nclaims of that distinguished inventor.  His knowledge of the history of\nthe cotton manufacture in its various stages, and of mechanical\ninventions generally, was most extensive and accurate.  Among his\nfriends he numbered James Watt, who placed his son in his establishment\nfor the purpose of acquiring knowledge and experience of his\nprofession.  At a much later period he numbered George Stephenson among\nhis friends, having been one of the first directors of the Liverpool\nand Manchester Railway, and one of the three judges (selected because\nof his sound judgment and proved impartiality, as well as his knowledge\nof mechanical engineering) to adjudicate on the celebrated competition\nof Locomotives at Rainhill.  By these successive steps did this poor\nScotch boy become one of the leading men of Manchester, closing his\nlong and useful life in 1855 at an advanced age, his mental faculties\nremaining clear and unclouded to the last.  His departure from life was\nhappy and tranquil--so easy that it was for a time doubtful whether he\nwas dead or asleep.\n\nTo return to Mr. Fairbairn's career, and his progress as a millwright\nand engineer in Manchester.  When he and his partner undertook the\nextensive alterations in Mr. Murray's factory, both were in a great\nmeasure unacquainted with the working of cotton-mills, having until\nthen been occupied principally with corn-mills, and printing and\nbleaching works; so that an entirely new field was now opened to their\nunited exertions.  Sedulously improving their opportunities, the young\npartners not only thoroughly mastered the practical details of\ncotton-mill work, but they were very shortly enabled to introduce a\nseries of improvements of the greatest importance in this branch of our\nnational manufactures.  Bringing their vigorous practical minds to bear\non the subject, they at once saw that the gearing of even the best\nmills was of a very clumsy and imperfect character.  They found the\nmachinery driven by large square cast-iron shafts, on which huge wooden\ndrums, some of them as much as four feet in diameter, revolved at the\nrate of about forty revolutions a minute; and the couplings were so\nbadly fitted that they might be heard creaking and groaning a long way\noff.  The speeds of the driving-shafts were mostly got up by a series\nof straps and counter drums, which not only crowded the rooms, but\nseriously obstructed the light where most required for conducting the\ndelicate operations of the different machines.  Another serious defect\nlay in the construction of the shafts, and in the mode of fixing the\ncouplings, which were constantly giving way, so that a week seldom\npassed without one or more breaks-down.  The repairs were usually made\non Sundays, which were the millwrights' hardest working days, to their\nown serious moral detriment; but when trade was good, every\nconsideration was made to give way to the uninterrupted running of the\nmills during the rest of the week.\n\nIt occurred to Mr. Fairbairn that the defective arrangements thus\nbriefly described, might be remedied by the introduction of lighter\nshafts driven at double or treble the velocity, smaller drums to drive\nthe machinery, and the use of wrought-iron wherever practicable,\nbecause of its greater lightness and strength compared with wood.  He\nalso provided for the simplification of the hangers and fixings by\nwhich the shafting was supported, and introduced the \"half-lap\ncoupling\" so well known to millwrights and engineers.  His partner\nentered fully into his views; and the opportunity shortly presented\nitself of carrying them into effect in the large new mill erected in\n1818, for the firm of MacConnel and Kennedy.  The machinery of that\nconcern proved a great improvement on all that had preceded it; and, to\nMessrs. Fairbairn and Lillie's new system of gearing Mr. Kennedy added\nan original invention of his own in a system of double speeds, with the\nobject of giving an increased quantity of twist in the finer\ndescriptions of mule yarn.\n\nThe satisfactory execution of this important work at once placed the\nfirm of Fairbairn and Lillie in the very front rank of engineering\nmillwrights.  Mr. Kennedy's good word was of itself a passport to fame\nand business, and as he was more than satisfied with the manner in\nwhich his mill machinery had been planned and executed, he sounded\ntheir praises in all quarters.  Orders poured in upon them so rapidly,\nthat they had difficulty in keeping pace with the demands of the trade.\nThey then removed from their original shed to larger premises in\nMatherstreet, where they erected additional lathes and other\ntool-machines, and eventually a steam-engine.  They afterwards added a\nlarge cellar under an adjoining factory to their premises; and from\ntime to time provided new means of turning out work with increased\nefficiency and despatch.  In due course of time the firm erected a\nfactory of their own, fitted with the most improved machinery for\nturning out millwork; and they went on from one contract to another,\nuntil their reputation as engineers became widely celebrated.  In\n1826-7, they supplied the water-wheels for the extensive cotton-mills\nbelonging to Kirkman Finlay and Company, at Catrine Bank in Ayrshire.\nThese wheels are even at this day regarded as among the most perfect\nhydraulic machines in Europe.  About the same time they supplied the\nmill gearing and water-machinery for Messrs. Escher and Company's large\nworks at Zurich, among the largest cotton manufactories on the\ncontinent.\n\nIn the mean while the industry of Manchester and the neighbourhood,\nthrough which the firm had risen and prospered, was not neglected, but\nhad the full benefit of the various improvements which they were\nintroducing in mill machinery.  In the course of a few years an entire\nrevolution was effected in the gearing.  Ponderous masses of timber and\ncast-iron, with their enormous bearings and couplings, gave place to\nslender rods of wrought-iron and light frames or hooks by which they\nwere suspended.  In like manner, lighter yet stronger wheels and\npulleys were introduced, the whole arrangements were improved, and, the\nworkmanship being greatly more accurate, friction was avoided, while\nthe speed was increased from about 40 to upwards of 300 revolutions a\nminute.  The fly-wheel of the engine was also converted into a first\nmotion by the formation of teeth on its periphery, by which a\nconsiderable saving was effected both in cost and power.\n\nThese great improvements formed quite an era in the history of mill\nmachinery; and exercised the most important influence on the\ndevelopment of the cotton, flax, silk, and other branches of\nmanufacture.  Mr. Fairbairn says the system introduced by his firm was\nat first strongly condemned by leading engineers, and it was with\ndifficulty that he could overcome the force of their opposition; nor\nwas it until a wheel of thirty tons weight for a pair of engines of\n100-horse power each was erected and set to work, that their\nprognostications of failure entirely ceased.  From that time the\nprinciples introduced by Mr. Fairbairn have been adopted wherever steam\nis employed as a motive power in mills.\n\nMr. Fairbairn and his partner had a hard uphill battle to fight while\nthese improvements were being introduced; but energy and perseverance,\nguided by sound judgment, secured their usual reward, and the firm\nbecame known as one of the most thriving and enterprising in\nManchester.  Long years after, when addressing an assembly of working\nmen, Mr. Fairbairn, while urging the necessity of labour and\napplication as the only sure means of self-improvement, said, \"I can\ntell you from experience, that there is no labour so sweet, none so\nconsolatory, as that which is founded upon an honest, straightforward,\nand honourable ambition.\"  The history of any prosperous business,\nhowever, so closely resembles every other, and its details are usually\nof so monotonous a character, that it is unnecessary for us to pursue\nthis part of the subject; and we will content ourselves with briefly\nindicating the several further improvements introduced by Mr. Fairbairn\nin the mechanics of construction in the course of his long and useful\ncareer.\n\nHis improvements in water-wheels were of great value, especially as\nregarded the new form of bucket which he introduced with the object of\nfacilitating the escape of the air as the water entered the bucket\nabove, and its readmission as the water emptied itself out below.  This\narrangement enabled the water to act upon the wheel with the maximum of\neffect in all states of the river; and it so generally recommended\nitself, that it very soon became adopted in most water-mills both at\nhome and abroad.[6]  His labours were not, however, confined to his own\nparticular calling as a mill engineer, but were shortly directed to\nother equally important branches of the constructive art.  Thus he was\namong the first to direct his attention to iron ship building as a\nspecial branch of business.  In 1829, Mr. Houston, of Johnstown, near\nPaisley, launched a light boat on the Ardrossan Canal for the purpose\nof ascertaining the speed at which it could be towed by horses with two\nor three persons on board.  To the surprise of Mr. Houston and the\nother gentlemen present, it was found that the labour the horses had to\nperform in towing the boat was mach greater at six or seven, than at\nnine miles an hour.  This anomaly was very puzzling to the\nexperimenters, and at the request of the Council of the Forth and Clyde\nCanal, Mr. Fairbairn, who had already become extensively known as a\nscientific mechanic, was requested to visit Scotland and institute a\nseries of experiments with light boats to determine the law of\ntraction, and clear up, if possible, the apparent anomalies in Mr.\nHouston's experiments.  This he did accordingly, and the results of his\nexperiments were afterwards published, The trials extended over a\nseries of years, and were conducted at a cost of several thousand\npounds.  The first experiments were made with vessels of wood, but they\neventually led to the construction of iron vessels upon a large scale\nand on an entirely new principle of construction, with angle iron ribs\nand wrought-iron sheathing plates.  The results proved most valuable,\nand had the effect of specially directing the attention of naval\nengineers to the employment of iron in ship building.\n\nMr. Fairbairn himself fully recognised the value of the experiments,\nand proceeded to construct an iron vessel at his works at Manchester,\nin 1831, which went to sea the same year.  Its success was such as to\ninduce him to begin iron shipbuilding on a large scale, at the same\ntime as the Messrs. Laird did at Birkenhead; and in 1835, Mr. Fairbairn\nestablished extensive works at Millwall, on the Thames,--afterwards\noccupied by Mr. Scott Russell, in whose yard the \"Great Eastern\"\nsteamship was erected,--where in the course of some fourteen years he\nbuilt upwards of a hundred and twenty iron ships, some of them above\n2000 tons burden.  It was in fact the first great iron shipbuilding\nyard in Britain, and led the way in a branch of business which has\nsince become of first-rate magnitude and importance.  Mr. Fairbairn was\na most laborious experimenter in iron, and investigated in great detail\nthe subject of its strength, the value of different kinds of riveted\njoints compared with the solid plate, and the distribution of the\nmaterial throughout the structure, as well as the form of the vessel\nitself.  It would indeed be difficult to over-estimate the value of his\ninvestigations on these points in the earlier stages of this now highly\nimportant branch of the national industry.\n\nTo facilitate the manufacture of his iron-sided ships, Mr. Fairbairn,\nabout the year 1839, invented a machine for riveting boiler plates by\nsteam-power.  The usual method by which this process had before been\nexecuted was by hand-hammers, worked by men placed at each side of the\nplate to be riveted, acting simultaneously on both sides of the bolt.\nBut this process was tedious and expensive, as well as clumsy and\nimperfect; and some more rapid and precise method of fixing the plates\nfirmly together was urgently wanted.  Mr. Fairbairn's machine\ncompletely supplied the want.  By its means the rivet was driven into\nits place, and firmly fastened there by a couple of strokes of a hammer\nimpelled by steam.  Aided by the Jacquard punching-machine of Roberts,\nthe riveting of plates of the largest size has thus become one of the\nsimplest operations in iron-manufacturing.\n\nThe thorough knowledge which Mr. Fairbairn possessed of the strength of\nwrought-iron in the form of the hollow beam (which a wrought-iron ship\nreally is) naturally led to his being consulted by the late Robert\nStephenson as to the structures by means of which it was proposed to\nspan the estuary of the Conway and the Straits of Menai; and the result\nwas the Conway and Britannia Tubular Bridges, the history of which we\nhave fully described elsewhere.[7]  There is no reason to doubt that by\nfar the largest share of the merit of working out the practical details\nof those structures, and thus realizing Robert Stephenson's magnificent\nidea of the tubular bridge, belongs to Mr. Fairbairn.\n\nIn all matters connected with the qualities and strength of iron, he\ncame to be regarded as a first-rate authority, and his advice was often\nsought and highly valued.  The elaborate experiments instituted by him\nas to the strength of iron of all kinds have formed the subject of\nvarious papers which he has read before the British Association, the\nRoyal Society, and the Literary and Philosophical Society of\nManchester.  His practical inquiries as to the strength of boilers have\nled to his being frequently called upon to investigate the causes of\nboiler explosions, on which subject he has published many elaborate\nreports.  The study of this subject led him to elucidate the law\naccording to which the density of steam varies throughout an extensive\nrange of pressures and atmospheres,--in singular confirmation of what\nhad before been provisionally calculated from the mechanical theory of\nheat.  His discovery of the true method of preventing the tendency of\ntubes to collapse, by dividing the flues of long boilers into short\nlengths by means of stiffening rings, arising out of the same\ninvestigation, was one of the valuable results of his minute study of\nthe subject; and is calculated to be of essential value in the\nmanufacturing districts by diminishing the chances of boiler\nexplosions, and saving the lamentable loss of life which has during the\nlast twenty years been occasioned by the malconstruction of boilers.\nAmong Mr. Fairbairn's most recent, inquiries are those conducted by him\nat the instance of the British Government relative to the construction\nof iron-plated ships, his report of which has not yet been made public,\nmost probably for weighty political reasons.\n\nWe might also refer to the practical improvements which Mr. Fairbairn\nhas been instrumental in introducing in the construction of buildings\nof various kinds by the use of iron.  He has himself erected numerous\niron structures, and pointed out the road which other manufacturers\nhave readily followed.  \"I am one of those,\" said he, in his 'Lecture\non the Progress of Engineering,' \"who have great faith in iron walls\nand iron beams; and although I have both spoken and written much on the\nsubject, I cannot too forcibly recommend it to public attention.  It is\nnow twenty years since I constructed an iron house, with the machinery\nof a corn-mill, for Halil Pasha, then Seraskier of the Turkish army at\nConstantinople.  I believe it was the first iron house built in this\ncountry; and it was constructed at the works at Millwall, London, in\n1839.\" [8]\n\nSince then iron structures of all kinds have been erected:  iron\nlighthouses, iron-and-crystal palaces, iron churches, and iron bridges.\nIron roads have long been worked by iron locomotives; and before many\nyears have passed a telegraph of iron wire will probably be found\ncircling the globe.  We now use iron roofs, iron bedsteads, iron ropes,\nand iron pavement; and even the famous \"wooden walls of England\" are\nrapidly becoming reconstructed of iron.  In short, we are in the midst\nof what Mr. Worsaae has characterized as the Age of Iron.\n\nAt the celebration of the opening of the North Wales Railway at Bangor,\nalmost within sight of his iron bridge across the Straits of Menai,\nRobert Stephenson said, \"We are daily producing from the bowels of the\nearth a raw material, in its crude state apparently of no worth, but\nwhich, when converted into a locomotive engine, flies over bridges of\nthe same material, with a speed exceeding that of the bird, advancing\nwealth and comfort throughout the country.  Such are the powers of that\nall-civilizing instrument, Iron.\"\n\nIron indeed plays a highly important part in modern civilization.  Out\nof it are formed alike the sword and the ploughshare, the cannon and\nthe printing-press; and while civilization continues partial and\nhalf-developed, as it still is, our liberties and our industry must\nnecessarily in a great measure depend for their protection upon the\nexcellence of our weapons of war as well as on the superiority of our\ninstruments of peace.  Hence the skill and ingenuity displayed in the\ninvention of rifled guns and artillery, and iron-sided ships and\nbatteries, the fabrication of which would be impossible but for the\nextraordinary development of the iron-manufacture, and the marvellous\npower and precision of our tool-making machines, as described in\npreceding chapters.\n\n\"Our strength, wealth, and commerce,\" said Mr. Cobden in the course of\na recent debate in the House of Commons, \"grow out of the skilled\nlabour of the men working in metals.  They are at the foundation of our\nmanufacturing greatness; and in case you were attacked, they would at\nonce be available, with their hard hands and skilled brains, to\nmanufacture your muskets and your cannon, your shot and your shell.\nWhat has given us our Armstrongs, Whitworths, and Fairbairns, but the\nfree industry of this country? If you can build three times more\nsteam-engines than any other country, and have threefold the force of\nmechanics, to whom and to what do you owe that, but to the men who have\ntrained them, and to those principles of commerce out of which the\nwealth of the country has grown? We who have some hand in doing that,\nare not ignorant that we have been and are increasing the strength of\nthe country in proportion as we are raising up skilled artisans.\" [9]\n\nThe reader who has followed us up to this point will have observed that\nhandicraft labour was the first stage of the development of human\npower, and that machinery has been its last and highest.  The\nuncivilized man began with a stone for a hammer, and a splinter of\nflint for a chisel, each stage of his progress being marked by an\nimprovement in his tools.  Every machine calculated to save labour or\nincrease production was a substantial addition to his power over the\nmaterial resources of nature, enabling him to subjugate them more\neffectually to his wants and uses; and every extension of machinery has\nserved to introduce new classes of the population to the enjoyment of\nits benefits.  In early times the products of skilled industry were for\nthe most part luxuries intended for the few, whereas now the most\nexquisite tools and engines are employed in producing articles of\nordinary consumption for the great mass of the community.  Machines\nwith millions of fingers work for millions of purchasers--for the poor\nas well as the rich; and while the machinery thus used enriches its\nowners, it no less enriches the public with its products.\n\nMuch of the progress to which we have adverted has been the result of\nthe skill and industry of our own time.  \"Indeed,\" says Mr. Fairbairn,\n\"the mechanical operations of the present day could not have been\naccomplished at any cost thirty years ago; and what was then considered\nimpossible is now performed with an exactitude that never fails to\naccomplish the end in view.\"  For this we are mainly indebted to the\nalmost creative power of modern machine-tools, and the facilities which\nthey present for the production and reproduction of other machines.  We\nalso owe much to the mechanical agencies employed to drive them.  Early\ninventors yoked wind and water to sails and wheels, and made them work\nmachinery of various kinds; but modern inventors have availed\nthemselves of the far more swift and powerful, yet docile force of\nsteam, which has now laid upon it the heaviest share of the burden of\ntoil, and indeed become the universal drudge.  Coal, water, and a\nlittle oil, are all that the steam-engine, with its bowels of iron and\nheart of fire, needs to enable it to go on working night and day,\nwithout rest or sleep.  Yoked to machinery of almost infinite variety,\nthe results of vast ingenuity and labour, the Steam-engine pumps water,\ndrives spindles, thrashes corn, prints books, hammers iron, ploughs\nland, saws timber, drives piles, impels ships, works railways,\nexcavates docks; and, in a word, asserts an almost unbounded supremacy\nover the materials which enter into the daily use of mankind, for\nclothing, for labour, for defence, for household purposes, for\nlocomotion, for food, or for instruction.\n\n\n\n[1] Long after, when married and settled at Manchester, the fiddle,\nwhich had been carefully preserved, was taken down from the shelf for\nthe amusement of the children; but though they were well enough pleased\nwith it, the instrument was never brought from its place without\ncreating alarm in the mind of their mother lest anybody should hear it.\nAt length a dancing-master, who was giving lessons in the\nneighbourhood, borrowed the fiddle, and, to the great relief of the\nfamily, it was never returned.  Many years later Mr. Fairbairn was\npresent at the starting of a cotton mill at Wesserling in Alsace\nbelonging to Messrs. Gros, Deval, and Co., for which his Manchester\nfirm had provided the mill-work and water-wheel (the first erected in\nFrance on the suspension principle, when the event was followed by an\nentertainment).  During dinner Mr. Fairbairn had been explaining to M.\nGros, who spoke a little English, the nature of home-brewed beer, which\nhe much admired, having tasted it when in England.  The dinner was\nfollowed by music, in the performance of which the host himself took\npart; and on Mr. Fairbairn's admiring his execution on the violin, M.\nGros asked him if he played.  \"A little,\" was the almost unconscious\nreply.  \"Then you must have the goodness to play some,\" and the\ninstrument was in a moment placed in his hands, amidst urgent requests\nfrom all sides that he should play.  There was no alternative; so he\nproceeded to perform one of his best tunes--\"The Keel Row.\"  The\ncompany listened with amazement, until the performer's career was\nsuddenly cut short by the host exclaiming at the top of his voice,\n\"Stop, stop, Monsieur, by gar that be HOME-BREWED MUSIC!\"\n\n[2] \"Although not a native of Newcastle,\" he then said, \"he owed almost\neverything to Newcastle.  He got the rudiments of his education there,\nsuch as it was; and that was (something like that of his revered\npredecessor George Stephenson) at a colliery.  He was brought up as an\nengineer at the Percy Main Colliery.  He was there seven years; and if\nit had not been for the opportunities he then enjoyed, together with\nthe use of the library at North Shields, he believed he would not have\nbeen there to address them.  Being self-taught, but with some little\nambition, and a determination to improve himself, he was now enabled to\nstand before them with some pretensions to mechanical knowledge, and\nthe persuasion that he had been a useful contributor to practical\nscience and objects connected with mechanical engineering.\"--Meeting of\nthe Institute of Mechanical Engineers at Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1858.\n\n[3] Useful Information for Engineers, 2nd series, 1860, p. 211.\n\n[4] Lecture at Derby--Useful Information for Engineers, 2nd series, p.\n212.\n\n[5] One of the reasons which induced Kennedy thus early to begin the\nbusiness of mule-spinning has been related as follows.  While employed\nas apprentice at Chowbent, he happened to sleep over the master's\napartment; and late one evening, on the latter returning from market,\nhis wife asked his success.  \"I've sold the eightys,\" said he, \"at a\nguinea a pound.\"  \"What,\" exclaimed the mistress, in a loud voice,\n\"sold the eightys for ONLY a guinea a pound!  I never heard of such a\nthing.\"  The apprentice could not help overhearing the remark, and it\nset him a-thinking.  He knew the price of cotton and the price of\nlabour, and concluded there must be a very large margin of profit.  So\nsoon as he was out of his time, therefore, he determined that he should\nbecome a cotton spinner.\n\n[6] The subject will be found fully treated in Mr. Fairbairn's own\nwork, A Treatise on Mills and Mill-Work, embodying the results of his\nlarge experience.\n\n[7] Lives of the Engineers, vol. iii. 416-40.  See also An Account of\nthe Construction of the Britannia and Conway Tubular Bridges.  By\nWilliam Fairbairn, C.E. 1849.\n\n[8] Useful Information for Engineers, 2nd series, 225.  The mere list\nof Mr. Fairbairn's writings would occupy considerable space; for,\nnotwithstanding his great labours as an engineer, he has also been an\nindustrious writer.  His papers on Iron, read at different times before\nthe British Association, the Royal Society, and the Literary and\nPhilosophical Institution of Manchester, are of great value.  The\ntreatise on \"Iron\" in the Encyclopaedia Britannica is from his pen, and\nhe has contributed a highly interesting paper to Dr. Scoffern's Useful\nMetals and their Alloys on the Application of Iron to the purposes of\nOrdnance, Machinery, Bridges, and House and Ship Building.  Another\nvaluable but less-known contribution to Iron literature is his Report\non Machinery in General, published in the Reports on the Paris\nUniversal Exhibition of 1855.  The experiments conducted by Mr.\nFairbairn for the purpose of proving the excellent properties of iron\nfor shipbuilding--the account of which was published in the Trans\nactions of the Royal Society eventually led to his further experiments\nto determine the strength and form of the Britannia and Conway Tubular\nBridges, plate-girders, and other constructions, the result of which\nwas to establish quite a new era in the history of bridge as well as\nship building.\n\n[9] House of Commons Debate, 7th July, 1862.",
