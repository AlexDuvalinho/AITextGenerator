The Report\nof the Government committee appointed to inquire into the\ntreatment of habitual drunkards, the Report of the committee of\ninquiry into the best means of identifying habitual criminals, the\nrevision of the English criminal returns, the Reports of\ncommittees appointed to inquire into the administration of prisons\nand the best methods of dealing with habitual offenders, vagrants,\nbeggars, inebriate and juvenile delinquents, are all evidence of\nthe fact that the formidable problem of crime is again pressing\nits way to the front and demanding re-examination at the hands of\nthe present generation.  The real dimensions of the question, as\nProfessor Ferri points out, are partially hidden by the\nsuperficial interpretations which are so often placed upon the\nreturns relating to crime.  If the population of prisons or\npenitentiaries should happen to be declining, this is immediately\ninterpreted to mean that crime is<p v> <p vi>on the decrease.  And\nyet a cursory examination of the facts is sufficient to show that\na decrease in the prison population is merely the result of\nshorter sentences and the substitution of fines or other similar\npenalties for imprisonment.  If the list of offences for trial\nbefore a judge and jury should exhibit any symptoms of diminution,\nthis circumstance is immediately seized upon as a proof that the\ncriminal population is declining, and yet the diminution may\nmerely arise from the fact that large numbers of cases which used\nto be tried before a jury are now dealt with summarily by a\nmagistrate.  In other words, what we witness is a change of\njudicial procedure, but not necessarily a decrease of crime.\nAgain, when it is pointed out that the number of persons for trial\nfor indictable offences in England and Wales amounted to 53,044 in\n1874-8 and 56,472 in 1889-93, we are at a loss to see what colour\nthese figures give to the statement that there has been a real and\nsubstantial decrease of crime.  The increase, it is true, may not\nbe keeping pace with the growth of the general population, but, as\nan eminent judge recently stated from the bench, this is to be\naccounted for by the fact that the public is every year becoming\nmore lenient and more unwilling to prosecute.  But an increase of\nleniency, however excellent in itself, is not to be confounded\nwith a decrease of crime.  In the study of social phenomena our\nparamount duty is to look at facts and not appearances.\n\nBut whether criminality is keeping pace with the growth of\npopulation or not it is a problem of great <p vii>magnitude all\nthe same, and it will not be solved, as Professor Ferri points\nout, by a mere resort to punishments of greater rigour and\nseverity.  On this matter he is at one with the Scotch\ndepartmental committee appointed to inquire into the best means of\ndealing with habitual offenders, vagrants, and juveniles.  As far\nas the suppression of vagrancy is concerned the members of the\ncommittee are unanimously of opinion that ``the severest\nenactments of the general law are futile, and that the best\nresults have been obtained by the milder provisions of more recent\nstatutes.''  They also speak of the ``utter inadequacy of the\npresent system in all the variety of detail which it offers to\ndeter the habitual offender from a course of life which devolves\nthe cost of his maintenance on the prison and the poorhouse when\nhe is not preying directly on the public.''  The committee state\nthat they have had testimony from a large number of witnesses\nsupporting the view that ``long sentences of imprisonment effect\nno good result,'' and they arrive at the conclusion that to double\nthe present sentences would not diminish the number of habitual\noffenders.  In this conclusion they are at one with the views of\nthe Royal Commission on Penal Servitude, which acquiesced in the\nobjection to the penal servitude system on the ground that it\n``not only fails to reform offenders, but in the case of the less\nhardened criminals and especially first offenders produces a\ndeteriorating effect.''  A similar opinion was recently expressed\nby the Prisons Committee presided over by Mr. Herbert Gladstone.\nAs soon as punishment reaches <p viii>a point at which it makes\nmen worse than they were before, it becomes useless as an\ninstrument of reformation or social defence.\n\nThe proper method of arriving at a more or less satisfactory\nsolution of the criminal problem is to inquire into the causes\nwhich are producing the criminal population, and to institute\nremedies based upon the results of such an inquiry.  Professor\nFerri's volume has this object in view.  The first chanter, on the\ndata of Criminal Anthropology, is an inquiry into the individual\nconditions which tend to produce criminal habits of mind and\naction.  The second chapter, on the data of criminal statistics,\nis an examination of the adverse social conditions which tend to\ndrive certain sections of the population into crime.  It is\nProfessor Ferri's contention that the volume of crime will not be\nmaterially diminished by codes of criminal law however skilfully\nthey may be constructed, but by an amelioration of the adverse\nindividual and social conditions of the community as a whole.\nCrime is a product of these adverse conditions, and the only\neffective way of grappling with it is to do away as far as\npossible with the causes from which it springs.  Although criminal\ncodes can do comparatively little towards the reduction of crime,\nthey are absolutely essential for the protection of society.\nAccordingly, the last chapter, on Practical Reforms, is intended\nto show how criminal law and prison administration may be made\nmore effective for purposes of social defence.\n\n                                        W.

Attention must be drawn to these\nconditions at the outset, for it is only by accurately defining\nthem that the scientific conscience of the student of sociology is\ndeveloped and confirmed.\n\nThe experimental philosophy of the latter half of our century,\ncombined with human biology and psychology, and with the natural\nstudy of human society, had already produced an intellectual\natmosphere decidedly favourable to a practical inquiry into the\ncriminal manifestations of individual and social life.<p xv>\n<p xvi>\n\nTo these general conditions must be added the plain and everyday\ncontrast between the metaphysical perfection of criminal law and\nthe progressive increase of crime, as well as the contrast between\nlegal theories of crime and the study of the mental\ncharacteristics of a large number of criminals.\n\nFrom this point onwards, nothing could be more natural than the\nrise of a new school, whose object was to make an experimental\nstudy of social pathology in respect of its criminal symptoms, in\norder to bring theories of crime and punishment into harmony with\neveryday facts.  This is the positive school of criminal law,\nwhereof the fundamental purpose is to study the natural genesis of\ncriminality in the criminal, and in the physical and social\nconditions of his life, so as to apply the most effectual remedies\nto the various causes of crime.\n\nThus we are not concerned merely with the construction of a theory\nof anthropology or psychology, or a system of criminal statistics,\nnor merely with the setting of abstract legal theories against\nother theories which are still more abstract.  Our task is to show\nthat the basis of every theory concerning the self-defence of the\ncommunity against evil-doers must be the observation of the\nindividual and of society in their criminal activity.  In one\nword, our task is to construct a criminal sociology.\n\nFor, as it seems to me, all that general sociology can do is to\nfurnish the more ordinary and universal inferences concerning the\nlife of communities; and upon this canvas the several sciences of\nsociology are delineated by the specialised observation of each\n<p xvii>distinct order of social facts.  In this manner we may\nconstruct a political sociology, an economic sociology, a legal\nsociology, by studying the special laws of normal or social\nactivity amongst human beings, after previously studying the more\ngeneral laws of individual and collective existence.  And thus we\nmay construct a criminal sociology, by studying, with such an aim\nand by such a method, the abnormal and anti-social actions of\nhuman beings--or, in other words, by studying crime and criminals.\n\nNeither the Romans, great exponents as they were of the civil law,\nnor the practical spirits of the Middle Ages, had been able to lay\ndown a philosophic system of criminal law.  It was Beccaria,\ninfluenced far more by sentiment than by scientific precision, who\ngave a great impetus to the doctrine of crimes and punishments by\nsummarising the ideas and sentiments of his age.[1]  Out of the\nvarious germs contained in his generous initiative there has been\ndeveloped, to his well-deserved credit, the classical school of\ncriminal law.\n\n\n[1] Desjardins, in the Introduction to his ``Cahiers des <E'>tats\nG<e'>n<e'>raux en 1789 et la L<e'>gislation Criminelle,'' Paris,\n1883, gives a good description of the state of public opinion in\nthat age.  He speaks also of the charges which were brought\nagainst the advocates of the new doctrines concerning crime, that\nthey upset the moral and social order of things.  Nowadays,\ncharges against the experimental school are cited from these same\nadvocates; for the revolutionary of yesterday is very often the\nconservative of to-day.\n\n\nThis school had, and still has, a practical purpose, namely, to\ndiminish all punishments, and to abolish a certain number, by a\nmagnanimous reaction of humanity against the arbitrary harshness\nof medi<ae>val times.  It had also, and still has, a method of its\nown, <p xviii>namely, to study crime from its first principles, as\nan abstract entity dependent upon law.\n\nHere and there since the time of Beccaria another stream of theory\nhas made itself manifest.  Thus there is the correctional school,\nwhich Roeder brought into special prominence not many years ago.\nBut though it flourished in Germany, less in Italy and France, and\nsomewhat more in Spain, it had no long existence as an independent\nschool, for it was only too easily confuted by the close sequence\nof inexorable facts.  Moreover, it could do no more than oppose a\nfew humanitarian arguments on the reformation of offenders to the\ntraditional arguments of the theories of jurisprudence, of\nabsolute and relative justice, of intimidation, utility, and the\nlike.\n\nNo doubt the principle that punishment ought to have a reforming\neffect upon the criminal survives as a rudimentary organ in nearly\nall the schools which concern themselves with crime.  But this is\nonly a secondary principle, and as it were the indirect object of\npunishment; and besides, the observations of anthropology,\npsychology, and criminal statistics have finally disposed of it,\nhaving established the fact that, under any system of punishment,\nwith the most severe or the most indulgent methods, there are\nalways certain types of criminals, representing a large number of\nindividuals, in regard to whom amendment is simply impossible, or\nvery transitory, on account of their organic and moral\ndegeneration.  Nor must we forget that, since the natural roots of\ncrime spring not only from the individual organism, but also, in\nlarge measure, from its physical and social environment,\n<p xix>correction of the individual is not sufficient to prevent\nrelapse if we do not also, to the best of our ability, reform the\nsocial environment.  The utility and the duty of reformation none\nthe less survive, even for the positive school, whenever it is\npossible, and for certain classes of criminals; but, as a\nfundamental principle of a scientific theory, it has passed away.\n\nHitherto, then, the classical school stands alone, with varying\nshades of opinion, but one and distinct as a method, and as a body\nof principles and consequences.  And whilst it has achieved its\naim in the most recent penal codes, with a great, and too\nfrequently an excessive diminution of punishments, so in respect\nof theory, in Italy, Germany, and France it has crowned its work\nwith a series of masterpieces amongst which I will only mention\nCarrara's ``Programme of Criminal Law.''  As the author tells us\nin one of his later editions, from the <_a!> priori_ principle\nthat ``crime is a fact dependent upon law, an infraction rather\nthan an action,'' he deduced--and that by the sheer force of an\nadmirable logic--a complete symmetrical scheme of legal and\nabstract consequences, wherein judges are compelled, whether they\nlike it or not, to determine the position of every criminal who\ncomes before them.\n\nBut now the classical school, which sprang from the marvellous\nlittle work of Beccaria, has completed its historic cycle.  It has\nyielded all it could, and writers of the present day who still\ncling to it can only recast the old material.  The youngest of\nthem, indeed, are condemned to a sort of Byzantine discussion of\n<p xx>scholastic formulas, and to a sterile process of scientific\nrumination.\n\nAnd meantime, outside our universities and academies, criminality\ncontinues to grow, and the punishments hitherto inflicted, though\nthey can neither protect nor indemnify the honest, succeed in\ncorrupting and degrading evil-doers.  And whilst our treatises and\ncodes (which are too often mere treatises cut up into segments)\nlose themselves in the fog of their legal abstractions, we feel\nmore strongly every day, in police courts and at assizes, the\nnecessity for those biological and sociological studies of crime\nand criminals which, when logically directed, can throw light as\nnothing else can upon the administration of\nthe penal law.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE DATA OF CRIMINAL ANTHROPOLOGY.\n\nTHE experimental school of criminal sociology took its original\ntitle from its studies of anthropology; it is still commonly\nregarded as little more than a ``criminal anthropology school.''\nAnd though this title no longer corresponds with the development\nof the school, which also takes into account and investigates the\ndata of psychology, statistics, and sociology, it is none the less\ntrue that the most characteristic impetus of the new scientific\nmovement was due to anthropological studies.  This was\nconspicuously the case when Lombroso, giving a scientific form to\nsundry scattered and fragmentary observations upon criminals,\nadded fresh life to them by a collection of inquiries which were\nnot only original but also governed by a distinct idea, and\nestablished the new science of criminal anthropology.\n\nIt is possible, of course, to discover a very early origin for\ncriminal anthropology, as for general anthropology; for, as Pascal\nsaid, man has always been the most wonderful object of study to\nhimself.  For observations on physiognomy in particular we may go\nas far backwards as to Plato, and his comparisons of the human\nface and character with those<p 1> of the brutes, or even to\nAristotle, who still earlier observed the physical and\npsychological correspondence between the passions of men and their\nfacial expression.  And after the medi<ae>val gropings in\nchiromancy, metoscopy, podomancy and so forth, one comes to the\nseventeenth century studies in physiognomy by the Jesuit\nNiquetius, by Cortes, Cardanus, De la Chambre, Della Porta, &c.,\nwho were precursors of Gall, Spurzheim, and Lavater on one side,\nand, on the other, of the modern scientific study of the emotions,\nwith their expression in face and gesture, conducted by Camper,\nBell, Engel, Burgess, Duchenne, Gratiolet, Piderit, Mantegazza,\nSchaffhausen, Schack, Heiment, and above all by Darwin.\n\nWith regard to the special observation of criminals, over and\nabove the limited statements of the old physiognomists and\nphrenologists, Lauvergne (1841) in France and Attomyr (1842) in\nGermany had accurately applied the theories of Gall to the\nexamination of convicts; and their works, in spite of certain\nexaggerations of phrenology, are still a valuable treasury of\nobservations in anthropology.  In Italy, De Rolandis (1835) had\npublished his observations on a deceased criminal; in America,\nSampson (1846) had traced the connection between criminality and\ncerebral organisation; in Germany, Camper (1854) published a study\non the physiognomy of murderers; and Ave Lallemant (1858-62)\nproduced a long work on criminals, from the psychological point of\nview.\n\nBut the science of criminal anthropology, more <p 3>strictly\nspeaking, only begins with the observations of English gaol\nsurgeons and other learned men, such as Forbes Winslow (1854),\nMayhew (1860), Thomson (1870), Wilson (1870), Nicolson (1872),\nMaudsley (1873), and with the very notable work of Despine (1868),\nwhich indeed gave rise to the inquiries of Thomson, and which, in\nspite of its lack of synthetic treatment and systematic unity, is\nstill, taken in conjunction with the work of Ave Lallemant, the\nmost important inquiry in the psychological domain anterior to the\nwork of Lombroso.\n\nNevertheless, it was only with the first edition of ``The\nCriminal'' (1876) that criminal anthropology asserted itself as an\nindependent science, distinct from the main trunk of general\nanthropology, itself quite recent in its origin, having come into\nexistence with the works of Daubenton, Blumenbach, Soemmering,\nCamper, White, and Pritchard.\n\nThe work of Lombroso set out with two original faults: the mistake\nof having given undue importance, at any rate apparently, to the\ndata of craniology and anthropometry, rather than to those of\npsychology; and, secondly, that of having mixed up, in the first\ntwo editions, all criminals in a single class.  In later editions\nthese defects were eliminated, Lombroso having adopted the\nobservation which I made in the first instance, as to the various\nanthropological categories of criminals.  This does not prevent\ncertain critics of criminal anthropology from repeating, with a\nstrange monotony, the venerable objections as to the\n``impossibility of distinguishing a criminal from an honest man by\nthe shape of his skull,'' or of <p 4>``measuring human\nresponsibility in accordance with different craniological\ntypes.''[2]\n\n\n[2] Vol. ii. of the fourth edition of ``The Criminal'' (1889) is\nspecially concerned with the epileptic and idiotic criminal\n(referred to alcoholism, hysteria, mattoidism) whether occasional\nor subject to violent impulse; whilst vol. i. is concerned only\nwith congenital criminality and moral insanity.\n\n\nBut these original faults in no way obscure the two following\nnoteworthy facts--that within a few years after the publication of\n``The Criminal'' there were published, in Italy and elsewhere, a\nwhole library of studies in criminal anthropology, and that a new\nschool has been established, having a distinct method and\nscientific developments, which are no longer to be looked for in\nthe classical school of criminal law.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nWhat, then, is criminal anthropology?  And of what nature are its\nfundamental data, which lead us up to the general conclusions of\ncriminal sociology?\n\nIf general anthropology is, according to the definition of M. de\nQuatrefages, the natural history of man, as zoology is the natural\nhistory of animals, criminal anthropology is but the study of a\nsingle variety of mankind.  In other words, it is the natural\nhistory of the criminal man.\n\nCriminal anthropology studies the criminal man in his organic and\npsychical constitution, and in his life as related to his physical\nand social environment--just as anthropology has done for man in\ngeneral, and for the various races of mankind.  So that, as\nalready said, whilst the classical observers of crime study\n<p 5>various offences in their abstract character, on the\nassumption that the criminal, apart from particular cases which\nare evident and appreciable, is a man of the ordinary type, under\nnormal conditions of intelligence and feeling, the anthropological\nobservers of crime, on the other hand, study the criminal first of\nall by means of direct observations, in anatomical and\nphysiological laboratories, in prisons and madhouses, organically\nand physically, comparing him with the typical characteristics of\nthe normal man, as well as with those of the mad and the\ndegenerate.\n\nBefore recounting the general data of criminal anthropology, it is\nnecessary to lay particular stress upon a remark which I made in\nthe original edition of this work, but which our opponents have\ntoo frequently ignored.\n\nWe must carefully discriminate between the technical value of\nanthropological data concerning the criminal man and their\nscientific function in criminal sociology.\n\nFor the student of criminal anthropology, who builds up the\nnatural history of the criminal, every characteristic has an\nanatomical, or a physiological, or a psychological value in\nitself, apart from the sociological conclusions which it may be\npossible to draw from it.  The technical inquiry into these bio-\npsychical characteristics is the special work of this new science\nof criminal anthropology.\n\nNow these data, which are the conclusions of the anthropologist,\nare but starting-points for the criminal sociologist, from which\nhe has to reach his legal and social conclusions.  Criminal\nanthropology is to <p 6>criminal sociology, in its scientific\nfunction, what the biological sciences, in description and\nexperimentation, are to clinical practice.\n\nIn other words, the criminal sociologist is not in duty bound to\nconduct for himself the inquiries of criminal anthropology, just\nas the clinical operator is not bound to be a physiologist or an\nanatomist.  No doubt the direct observation of criminals is a very\nserviceable study, even for the criminal sociologist; but the only\nduty of the latter is to base his legal and social inferences upon\nthe positive data of criminal anthropology for the biological\naspects of crime, and upon statistical data for the influences of\nphysical and social environment, instead of contenting himself\nwith mere abstract legal syllogisms.\n\nOn the other hand it is clear that sundry questions which have a\ndirect bearing upon criminal anthropology--as, for instance, in\nregard to some particular biological characteristic, or to its\nevolutionary significance--have no immediate obligation or value\nfor criminal sociology, which employs only the fundamental and\nmost indubitable data of criminal anthropology.  So that it is but\na clumsy way of propounding the question to ask, as it is too\nfrequently asked:  ``What connection can there be between the\ncephalic index, or the transverse measurement of a murderer's jaw,\nand his responsibility for the crime which he has committed?''\nThe scientific function of the anthropological data is a very\ndifferent thing, and the only legitimate question which sociology\ncan put to anthropology is this:--``Is the criminal, and in what\nrespects is he, a normal <p 7>or an abnormal man?  And if he is,\nor when he is abnormal, whence is the abnormality derived?  Is it\ncongenital or contracted, capable or incapable of rectification?''\n\nThis is all; and yet it is sufficient to enable the student of\ncrime to arrive at positive conclusions concerning the measures\nwhich society can take in order to defend itself against crime;\nwhilst he can draw other conclusions from criminal statistics.\n\nAs for the principal data hitherto established by criminal\nanthropology, whilst we must refer the reader for detailed\ninformation to the works of specialists, we may repeat that this\nnew science studies the criminal in his organic and in his\npsychical constitution, for these are the two inseparable aspects\nof human existence.\n\nA beginning has naturally been made with the organic study of the\ncriminal, both anatomical and physiological, since we must study\nthe organ before the function, and the physical before the moral.\nThis, however, has given rise to a host of misconceptions and one-\nsided criticisms, which have not yet ceased; for criminal\nanthropology has been charged, by such as consider only the most\nconspicuous data with narrowing crime down to the mere result of\nconformations of the skull or convolutions of the brain.  The fact\nis that purely morphological observations are but preliminary\nsteps to the histological and physiological study of the brain,\nand of the body as a whole.\n\nAs for craniology, especially in regard to the two distinct and\ncharacteristic types of criminals--<p 8>murderers and thieves, an\nincontestable inferiority has been noted in the shape of the head,\nby comparison with normal men, together with a greater frequency\nof hereditary and pathological departures from the normal type.\nSimilarly an examination of the brains of criminals, whilst it\nreveals in them an inferiority of form and histological type,\ngives also, in a great majority of cases, indications of disease\nwhich were frequently undetected in their lifetime.  Thus M.\nDally, who for twenty years past has displayed exceptional acumen\nin problems of this kind, said that ``all the criminals who had\nbeen subjected to autopsy (after execution) gave evidence of\ncerebral injury.''[3]\n\n\n[3] In a discussion at the Medico-Psychological Society of Paris;\n``Proceedings'' for 1881, i. 93, 266, 280, 483.\n\n\nObservations of the physiognomy of criminals, which no one will\nundervalue who has studied criminals in their lifetime, with\nadequate knowledge, as well as other physical inquiries, external\nand internal, have shown the existence of remarkable types, from\nthe greater frequency of the tattooed man to exceptionally\nabnormal conditions of the frame and the organs, dating from\nbirth, together with many forms of contracted disease.\n\nFinally, inquiries of a physiological nature into the reflex\naction of the body, and especially into general and specific\nsensibility, and sensibility to pain, and into reflex action under\nexternal agencies, conducted with the aid of instruments which\nrecord the results, have shown abnormal conditions, all tending to\nphysical insensibility, deep-seated and <p 9>more or less\nabsolute, but incontestably different in kind from that which\nobtains amongst the average men of the same social classes.\n\nThese are organic conditions, it must be at once affirmed, which\naccount as nothing else can for the undeniable fact of the\nhereditary transmission of tendencies to crime, as well as of\npredisposition to insanity, to suicide, and to other forms of\ndegeneration.\n\nThe second division of criminal anthropology, which is by far the\nmore important, with a more direct influence upon criminal\nsociology, is the psychological study of the criminal.  This\nrecognition of its greater importance does not prevent our critics\nfrom concentrating their attack upon the organic characterisation\nof criminals, in oblivion of the psychological characterisation,\nwhich even in Lombroso's book occupies the larger part of the\ntext.[4]\n\n\n[4] A recent example of this infatuation amongst one-sided, and\ntherefore ineffectual critics is the work of Colajanni,\n``Socialism and Criminal Sociology,'' Catania, 1889.  In the first\nvolume, which is devoted to criminal anthropology, out of four\nhundred pages of argumentative criticism (which does not prevent\nthe author from taking our most fundamental conclusions on the\nanthropological classification of criminals, and on crime, as\nphenomena of psychical atavism), there are only six pages, 227-\n232, for the criticism of psychological types.\n\n\nCriminal psychology presents us with the characteristics which may\nbe called specially descriptive, such as the slang, the\nhandwriting, the secret symbols, the literature and art of the\ncriminal; and on the other hand it makes known to us the\ncharacteristics which, in combination with organic abnormality,\naccount for the development of crime in the individual.  And these\ncharacteristics are grouped <p 10>in two psychical and fundamental\nabnormalities, namely, moral insensibility and want of foresight.\n\nMoral insensibility, which is decidedly more congenital than\ncontracted, is either total or partial, and is displayed in\ncriminals who inflict personal injuries, as much as in others,\nwith a variety of symptoms which I have recorded elsewhere, and\nwhich are eventually reduced to these conditions of the moral\nsense in a large number of criminals--a lack of repugnance to the\nidea and execution of the offence, previous to its commission, and\nthe absence of remorse after committing it.\n\nOutside of these conditions of the moral sense, which is no\nspecial sentiment, but an expression of the entire moral\nconstitution of the individual, as the temperament is of his\nphysiological constitution, other sentiments, of selfishness or\neven of unselfishness, are not wanting in the majority of\ncriminals.  Hence arise many illusions for superficial observers\nof criminal life.  But these latter sentiments are either\nexcessive, as hate, cupidity, vanity and the like, and are thus\nstimulants to crime, or else, as with religion, love, honour,\nloyalty, and so on, they cease to be forces antagonistic to crime,\nbecause they have no foundation in a normal moral sense.\n\nFrom this fundamental inferiority of sentiment there follows an\ninferiority of intelligence, which, however, does not exclude\ncertain forms of craftiness, though it tends to inability to\nforesee the consequences of crime, far in excess of what is\nobserved in the average members of the classes of society to which\nthe several criminals belong.\n<p 11>\n\nThus the psychology of the criminal is summed up in a defective\nresistance to criminal tendencies and temptations, due to that\nill-balanced impulsiveness which characterises children and\nsavages.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nI have long been convinced, by my study of works on criminal\nanthropology, but especially by direct and continuous observation\nfrom a physiological or a psychological point of view of a large\nnumber of criminals, whether mad or of normal intelligence, that\nthe data of criminal anthropology are not entirely applicable, in\ntheir complete and essential form, to all who commit crimes.  They\nare to be confined to a certain number, who may be called\ncongenital, incorrigible, and habitual criminals.  But apart from\nthese there is a class of occasional criminals, who do not\nexhibit, or who exhibit in slighter degrees, the anatomical,\nphysiological, and psychological characteristics which constitute\nthe type described by Lombroso as ``the criminal man.''\n\nBefore further defining these two main classes of criminals, in\ntheir natural and descriptive characterisation, I must add a\npositive demonstration, which can be attested under two distinct\nforms--(1) by the results of anthropological observation of\ncriminals, and (2) by statistics of relapse, and of the\nmanifestations of crime which anthropologists have hitherto\nchiefly studied.\n\nAs for organic anomalies, as I cannot here treat <p 12>the whole\nmatter in detail, I will simply reproduce from my study of\nhomicide a summary of results for a single category of these\nanomalies, which a methodical observation of every class of\ncriminals will carry further and render more precise, as Lombroso\nhas already shown (see the fourth edition of his work, 1889, p.\n273).\n\n                                Homicides sentenced\n                        To penal        To Imprisonment      Soldiers\n                              servitude\n Persons in whom I detected     (346)               (363)            (711)\n No anomaly in the skull      11.9 p. c.          8.2 p. c.         37.2 p. c.\n One or two anomalies         47.2  ''            56.6  ''          51.8  ''\n Three or four anomalies      30.9  ''            32.6  ''          11    ''\n Five or six anomalies        6.7  ''             2.3  ''           0    ''\n Seven or more anomalies        .3  ''              .3  ''           0    ''\n\n\nThat is to say, men with normal skulls were three times as\nnumerous amongst soldiers as they were amongst criminals; of men\nwith a noteworthy number of anomalies occurring together (three or\nfour), there were three times as many amongst criminals as amongst\nsoldiers; and there was not one soldier amongst those who showed\nan extraordinary number (five or more).\n\nThis proves to demonstration not only the greater frequency of\nanomalous skulls (and the same is true of physiognomical,\nphysiological, and psychological anomalies) amongst criminals, but\nalso that amongst these criminals between fifty and sixty per\ncent. show very few anomalies, whilst about one-third of the whole\nnumber present a remarkable combination, and one-tenth are normal\nin this respect.\n<p 13>\n\nAmongst the statistical data exhibiting the primary\ncharacteristics of the majority of criminals, the data connected\nwith relapsed criminals are especially conspicuous.  Though\nrelapses, like first offences, are partly due to social\nconditions, they also have a manifest biological cause, since,\nunder the operation of the same penal system, there are some\nliberated prisoners who relapse and some who do not.\n\nThe statistics of relapse are unfortunately very difficult to\ncollect, on account of differences in the legislation of different\ncountries, and in the preparation of records, which, even under\nthe more general adoption of anthropometrical identification,\nrarely succeed in preventing the use of fresh names by\nprofessional criminals.  So that we may still say, in the words of\none who is a very good judge in this matter, M. Yvern<e!>s, not\nonly that ``the Prisons Congress of London (1872) was compelled to\nleave various problems undecided for lack of documentary evidence,\nand especially the question of relapsed criminals,'' but also that\nto this day (1879), ``we find varying results in different\ncountries, the exact significance of which is not apparent.''\n\nI have, however, published an essay on international statistics of\nrelapsed criminals, from which I drew the following general\nconclusion: that even in prison statistics, which often give\nhigher totals of relapsed cases than are given by judicial\nstatistics, because they are more personal, and therefore less\nuncertain, we never obtain the full number of relapses, though the\ntotals given vary from country to country, from district to\ndistrict, and from prison to prison.  It <p 14>would be impossible\nto state accurately what proportion the numbers given bear to the\nactual number; but I am justified in saying, from all the\nmaterials which I have collected and compared in the aforesaid\nessay, that the number of relapses in Europe is generally between\n50 and 60 per cent., and certainly rather above than below this\nlimit.  Whilst the Italian statistics, for instance, give 14 per\ncent. of relapses amongst prisoners sentenced to penal servitude,\nI found by experience 37 per cent; out of 346 who admitted to me\nthat they had relapsed; and, amongst those who had been sentenced\nto simple imprisonment, I found 60 per cent. out of 363, in place\nof the 33 per cent. recorded in the prison statistics.  The\ndifference may be due to the particular conditions of the prisons\nwhich I visited; but in any case it establishes the inadequacy of\nthe official figures dealing with relapse.\n\nAfter this statement of a general fact, which proves, as Lombroso\nand Espinas said, that ``the relapsed criminal is the rule rather\nthan the exception,'' we can proceed to set down the special\nproportions of relapse for each particular crime, so as to obtain\nan indication of the forms of crime which are most frequently\nresorted to by habitual criminals.\n\nFor Italy I have found that the highest percentages of relapse are\nafforded by persons convicted of theft and petty larceny, forgery,\nrape, manslaughter, conspiracy, and, at the correctional courts,\nvagrancy and mendicity.  The lowest percentages are amongst those\nconvicted of assault and bodily harm, murders, and infanticide.\n<p 15>\n\nFor France, where legal statistics are remarkably adapted for the\nmost minute inquiry, I have drawn up the following table of\nstatistics from the lists of persons convicted at the assize\ncourts and correctional tribunals, taking an average of the years\n1877-81, which is not sensibly affected by the results of\nsucceeding years.\n\nIt will be seen that the average of relapses for crimes against\nthe person is higher than the average for the most serious cases\nof murderous and indecent assault, which are clearly an outcome of\nthe most anti-social tendencies (such as parricide, murder, rape,\ninflicting bodily harm on parents, &c.).  Thus homicide and fatal\nwounding, though relapse is very frequent in these cases, still\ndisplay a less abnormal and more occasional character by their\nlower position in the table, as shown in the cases of infanticide,\nconcealment of birth, and abandonment of infants.  As for the very\nfrequent occurrence of relapse in special crimes, such as assaults\non officials and resistance to authority, which rarely come before\nthe assize courts--though even there they tend to support the\nhigher numbers in the tribunals--these are offences which may also\nbe committed by criminals of every kind, and which, moreover,\ndepend in some measure on the social factor of police\norganisation, and frequently on the psycho-pathological state of\nparticular individuals.\n\nThe somewhat rare occurrence of relapse in such a grave type of\nmurder as poisoning is noteworthy.  But this is only an effect of\nthe special psychology of these criminals, as I have explained\nelsewhere.\n\n\n{Table printed in ``landscape'' mode was not OCR'd.}\nFRANCE--CASES OF RELAPSE, 1877-81.\n\n\n\n<p 17>\n\nAmongst crimes against property, the most frequent relapses are\nfound in the case of thieves (not including thefts and breaches of\ntrust by domestic servants, which thus, proving their more\noccasional character, confirm the agreement of statistics with\ncriminal psychology).  The same thing is observed in regard to\nforgers of commercial documents and to fraudulent bankrupts, who\nare partly drawn into crime under the stress of personal or\ngeneral crises.  And the infrequency of relapse amongst postal\nemployees condemned for embezzlement, and amongst customs officers\nwho have been guilty of smuggling, is only a further confirmation\nof the inducement to crime by the opportunities met with in each\ncase, rather than by personal tendencies.\n\nAmongst minor offences, apart from that evasion of supervision\nwhich is no more than a legal condition, there are, both in France\nand in Italy, very frequent cases of relapse by vagabonds and\nmendicants, which is a consequence of social environment, as well\nas of the feeble organisation of the individuals.  Other relapses\nabove the average, included amongst these offences, constitute a\nsort of accessory criminality, existing side by side with the\nhabitual criminality of thieves, murderers, and the like, such as\ndrunkenness, attacks on public functionaries, infractions of the\nregulations of domicile, &c.\n\nIn thefts and resistance to authorities, relapse is less frequent\nhere than in the assize courts, for in the majority of these minor\noffences, in their general forms, there is a greater number of\noccasional offences, as is also the case with bankruptcies,\ndefamation, <p 18>abuse, rural offences, &c., which demonstrate\ntheir more occasional character by their very low figures.\n\nHence the statistics of general and specific relapse indirectly\nconfirm the fact that criminals, as a whole, have no uniform\nanthropological type; and that the bio-psychical types and\nanomalies belong more especially to the category of habitual\ncriminals and those born into the criminal class, who, after all,\nare the only ones hitherto studied by criminal anthropologists.\n\nWhat, then, is the numerical proportion of habitual criminals to\nthe aggregate number of criminals?\n\nIn the absence of direct inquiry, it is possible to get at this\nproportion indirectly, from facts of two kinds.  In the first\nplace, a study of the works on criminal anthropology supplies us\nwith an approximate figure, since the biological characteristics\nunited in individuals, in sufficient number to create a criminal\ntype, are met with in between forty and fifty per cent. of the\ntotal.\n\nAnd this conclusion may be confirmed by other data of criminal\nstatistics.\n\nWhilst the statistics of relapse give us a very limited number of\ncrimes and offences committed by born and habitual criminals,\nscience and criminal legislation give us a far more extended\nclassification.\n\nEllero reckoned in the penal code of the German Empire 203 crimes\nand offences; and I find that the Italian code of 1859 enumerates\nabout 180, the new code about 200, and the French penal code about\n150.  Thus the kind of crimes of habitual criminals <p 19>would\nonly be about one-tenth of the complete legal classification of\ncrimes and offences.\n\nIt is easy indeed to suppose that born and habitual criminals do\nnot generally commit political crimes and offences, nor offences\nconnected with the press, nor against freedom of worship, nor in\ncorruption of public functionaries, nor misuse of title or\nauthority; nor calumny, making false attestations or false\nreports; nor adultery, incest, or abduction of minors; nor\ninfanticide, abortion, or palming of children; nor betrayal of\nprofessional secrets; nor bankruptcy offences, nor damage to\nproperty, nor violation of domicile, nor illegal arrests, nor\nduels, nor defamation, nor abuse.  I say generally; for, as there\nare occasional criminals who commit the offences characteristic of\nhabitual criminality, such as homicides, robberies, rapes, &c., so\nthere are born criminals who sometimes commit crimes out of their\nordinary course.\n\nIt is now necessary to add a few statistical data in respect of\nthe classification of crime, which I take, like the others, from\nthe essay already mentioned.\n\n\n                                       ITALY.

These are printed ``landscape'' fashion in the book.}\n\n\n<p 20>\n\nThat is to say, habitual criminality would be represented, in\nItaly, by about 40 per cent. of the total number of condemned\npersons, and by somewhat less in France and Belgium.  This would\nbe accounted for in Belgium by the exclusion of vagrancy; but the\ndifference is virtually due to the greater frequency in Italy of\ncertain crimes, such as homicide, highway robbery with violence,\nand conspiracies.\n\nFurther, it is apparent that in all these countries the types of\nhabitual criminality, with the exception of thefts and vagrancy,\nare in greater proportion at the assizes, on account of their\nserious character.\n\nThe actual totals, however, are larger at the tribunals, for as,\nin the scale of animal life, the greatest fecundity belongs to the\nlower and smaller forms, so in the criminal scale, the less\nserious offences (such as simple theft, swindling, vagrancy, &c.)\nare the more numerous.  Thus, out of the total of 38 per cent. in\nItaly, 32 belong to the tribunals and 6 to the assizes; out of 35\nper cent in France, 33 belong to the tribunals and 2 to the\nassizes; and out of 30 per cent. in Belgium, 29 belong to the\ntribunals and 1 to the assizes.  This also is partly accounted for\nby legislative distinctions as to the respective jurisdictions of\nthese courts.\n\nAs to the particulars of the totals, it is found that thefts are\nthe most numerous types in Italy (20 per cent.), in France (24 per\ncent.), in Belgium (23 per cent.), and in Prussia (37 per cent.,\nincluding breaches of trust).[5]\n\n\n[5] Starke, ``Verbrechen und Verbrecher in Preussen,'' Berlin,\n1884, p. 92.\n\n\n<p 21>\n\nAfter theft, the most numerous in Italy are vagrancy (5 per\ncent.), homicides (4 per cent.), swindling (3 per cent.), forgery\n(.9 per cent.), rape (.4 per cent.), conspiracy (.4 per cent.),\nand incendiarism (.2 per cent.).\n\nIn France and Belgium we find the same relative frequency of\nvagrancy and swindling; but homicide, incendiarism, and conspiracy\nare less frequent, whilst rape is more common in France (.5 per\ncent.) and in Belgium (1 per cent.).\n\nSuch then are the most frequent forms of habitual criminality in\nthe generality of condemned persons; and it will be useful now to\ncontrast the more frequent forms of occasional criminality.  For\nItaly the only judicial statistics which are valuable for detailed\ninquiry are those of 1863, 1869-72.  For France, every volume of\nthe admirable series of criminal statistics may be utilised.\n\nIt will be seen that the frequency of these occasional crimes and\noffences in Italy and in France is very variable, though assaults\nand wounding, resistance to authorities, damage, defamation and\nabuse, are the most numerous in both countries.\n\nThe proportion of each offence to the total also varies\nconsiderably, not only through a difference of legislation between\nItaly and France in regard to poaching, drunkenness, frauds on\nrefreshment-house keepers, and so forth, but also by reason of the\ndifferent condition of individuals and of society in the two\ncountries.

Whilst the illegal carrying\nof arms, threats, false witness, escape from detention, violations\nof domicile, calumny, are of greater frequency in Italy than in\nFrance, the contrary is true of bankruptcy offences, political and\npress crimes and offences, on account of a manifest difference of\nthe moral, economic, and social conditions of the two countries,\nwhich are plainly discernible behind these apparently dry figures.\n\n\nIn addition to this demonstration, we have given anthropological\nand statistical proofs of the fundamental distinction between\nhabitual and occasional criminals, which had been pointed out by\nmany observers, but which had hitherto remained a simple assertion\nwithout manifest consequences.\n\nThis same distinction ought to be not only the basis of all\nsociological theory concerning crime, but also a point of\ndeparture for other distinctions more precise and complete, which\nI set forth in my previous studies on criminals, and which were\nsubsequently reproduced, with more or less of assent, by all\ncriminal sociologists.\n\nIn the first place, it is necessary to distinguish, amongst\nhabitual criminals, those who present a conspicuous and clinical\nform of mental aberration, which accounts for their anti-social\nactivity.\n<p 24>\n\nIn the second place, amongst habitual criminals who are not of\nunsound mind, however little the inmates of prisons may have been\nobserved with adequate ideas and experience, there is a clear\nindication of a class of individuals, physically or mentally\nabnormal, induced to crime by inborn tendencies, which are\nmanifest from their birth, and accompanied by symptoms of extreme\nmoral insensibility.  Side by side with these, another class\nchallenges attention, of individuals who have also been criminals\nfrom childhood, and who continue to be so, but who are in a\nspecial degree a product of physical and social environment, which\nhas persistently driven them into the criminal life, by their\nabandonment before and after the first offence, and which,\nespecially in the great towns, is very often forced upon them by\nthe actual incitement of their parents.\n\nAmongst occasional criminals, again, a special category is created\nby a kind of exaggeration of the characteristics, mainly\npsychological, of the type itself.  In the case of all occasional\ncriminals, the crime is brought about rather by the effects of\nenvironment than by the active tendencies of the individual; but\nwhilst in most of these individuals the deciding cause is only a\ncircumstance affecting all alike, with a few it is an exceptional\nconstraint of passion, a sort of psychological tempest, which\ndrives them into crime.\n\nThus, then, the entire body of criminals may be classed in five\ncategories, which as early as 1880 I described as criminal madmen,\nborn criminals, <p 25>criminals by contracted habits, occasional\ncriminals, and criminals of passion.\n\nAs already observed, criminal anthropology will not finally\nestablish itself until it has been developed by biological,\npsychological, and statistical monographs on each of these\ncategories, in such a manner as to present their anthropological\ncharacteristics with greater precision than they have hitherto\nattained.  So far, observers continue to give us the same\ncharacteristics for a large aggregate of criminals, classifying\nthem according to the form of their crime rather than according to\ntheir bio-social type.  In Lombroso's work, for instance, or in\nthat of Marro (and to some extent even in my work on homicide),\nthe characteristics are stated for a total, or for legal\ncategories of criminals, such as murderers, thieves, forgers, and\nso on, which include born criminals, occasional and habitual\ncriminals, and madmen.  The result is a certain measure of\ninconsistency, according to the predominance of one type or the\nother in the aggregate of criminals under observation.  This also\ncontributes to render the conclusions of criminal anthropology\nless evident.\n\nNevertheless, we may sum up the inquiries which have been made up\nto the present time; and in particular we may now point out the\ngeneral characteristics of the five classes of criminals, in\naccordance with my personal experience in the observation of\ncriminals.  It is to be hoped that successive observations of a\nmore methodical kind will gradually reinforce the accuracy of this\nclassification of symptoms.\n<p 26>\n\nIn the first place, it is evident that in a classification not\nexclusively biological, if it is to form the anthropological basis\nof criminal sociology, criminals of unsound mind must in all\nfairness be included.\n\nThe usual objection, recently repeated by M. Joly (``Le Crime,''\np. 62), which holds the term ``criminal madness'' to be self-\ncontradictory, since a madman is not morally responsible, and\ntherefore cannot be a criminal, is not conclusive.  We maintain\nthat responsibility to society, the only responsibility common to\nall criminals, exists also for criminals of unsound mind.\n\nNor, again, is it correct to say, with M. Bianchi, that mad\ncriminals should be referred to psychiatry, and not to criminal\nanthropology; for, though psychiatry is concerned with mad\ncriminals in a psycho-pathological sense, this does not prevent\ncriminal anthropology and sociology from also concerning\nthemselves with the same subjects, in order to constitute the\nnatural history of the criminal, and to suggest remedies in the\ninterest of society.\n\nAs for criminals of unsound mind, it is necessary to begin by\nplacing in a separate category such as cannot, after the studies\nof Lombroso and the Italian school of psychiatry, be distinguished\nfrom the born criminals properly so-called.  These are the persons\ntainted with a form of insanity which is known under various\nnames, from the ``moral insanity'' of Pritchard to the ``reasoning\nmadness'' of Verga.  Moral insanity, illustrated by the works of\nMendel, Legrand du Saulle, Maudsley, Krafft-Ebing, Savage, Hugues,\n<p 27>Hollander, Tamburini, Bonvecchiato, which, with the lack or\natrophy of the moral or social sense, and of _*apparent_ soundness\nof mind, is properly speaking only the essential psychological\ncondition of the born criminal.\n\nBeyond these morally insane people, who are very rare--for, as\nKrafft-Ebing and Lombroso have pointed out, they are found more\nfrequently in prisons than in mad-houses--there is the unhappily\nlarge body of persons tainted by a common and clinical form of\nmental alienation, all of whom are apt to become criminal.\n\nThe whole of these criminals of unsound mind cannot be included in\na single category; and such, indeed, is the opinion expressed by\nLombroso, in the second volume of the fourth edition of his work,\nafter his descriptive analysis of the chief forms of mental\nalienation.  As a matter of fact, not only are the organic, and\nespecially the psychological, characteristics of criminal madmen\nsometimes identical with and sometimes opposed to those of born\nand occasional criminals, but these very characteristics vary\nconsiderably between the different forms of mental alienation, in\nspite of the identity of the crime committed.\n\nIt is further to be observed, in respect of criminal madmen, that\nthis category also includes all the intermediary types between\ncomplete madness and a rational condition, who remain in what\nMaudsley has called the ``middle zone.''  The most frequent\nvarieties in the criminality of these partially insane persons, or\n``matto<i:>des,'' are the perpetrators of <p 28>attacks upon\nstatesmen, who are generally men with a grievance, irascible men,\nwriters of insane documents, and the like, such as Passanante,\nGuiteau, and Maclean.\n\nIn the same category are those who commit terrible crimes without\nmotive, and who nevertheless, according to the complacent\npsychology of the classical school, would be credited with a\nmaximum of moral soundness.\n\nAgain, there are the necrophiles, like Sergeant Bertrand, Verzeni,\nMenesclou, and very probably the undetected ``Jack the Ripper'' of\nLondon, who are tainted with a form of sexual psychopathy.  Yet\nagain there are such as are tainted with hereditary madness, and\nespecially the epileptics and epileptoids, who may also be\nassigned to the class of born criminals, according to the\nplausible hypothesis of Lombroso as to the fundamental identity of\ncongenital criminality, moral madness, and epilepsy.  I have\nalways found in my own experience that outrageous murders, not to\nbe explained according to the ordinary psychology of criminals,\nare accompanied by psychical epilepsy, or larvea.\n\n\nBorn or instinctive criminals are those who most frequently\npresent the organic and psychological characteristics established\nby criminal anthropology.  These are either savage or brutal men,\nor crafty and idle, who draw no distinction between homicide,\nrobbery or other kinds of crime, and honest industry.  ``They are\ncriminals just as others are good workingmen,'' says Fr<e'>gier;\nand, as Romagnosi put it, actual <p 29>punishment affects them\nmuch less than the menace of punishment, or does not affect them\nat all, since they regard imprisonment as a natural risk of their\noccupation, as masons regard the fall of a roof, or as miners\nregard fire-damp.  ``They do not suffer in prison.  They are like\na painter in his studio, dreaming of their next masterpiece.  They\nare on good terms with their gaolers, and even know how to make\nthemselves useful.''[5]\n\n\n[5] Moreau, ``Souvenirs de la petite et grande Roquette,'' Paris,\n1884, ii. 440.\n\n\n\nThe born criminals and the occasional criminals constitute the\nmajority of the characteristic and diverse types of homicide and\nthief.  Prison governors call them ``gaol-birds.''  They pass on\nfrom the police to the judge and to the prison, and from the\nprison to the police and to the judge, with a regularity which has\nnot yet impaired the faith of law-makers in the efficacy of\npunishment as a cure for crime.[6]\n\n\n[6] Wayland, ``The Incorrigible,'' in the _Journal of Mental\nScience_, 1888.  Sichart, ``Criminal Incorrigibles.''\n\n\n\nNo doubt the idea of a born criminal is a direct challenge to the\ntraditional belief that the conduct of every man is the outcome of\nhis free will, or at most of his lack of education rather than of\nhis original physio-psychical constitution.  But, in the first\nplace, even public opinion, when not prejudiced in favour of the\nso-called consequences of irresponsibility, recognises in many\nfamiliar and everyday cases that there are criminals who, without\nbeing mad, are still not as ordinary men; and the reporters call\nthem ``human tigers,'' ``brutes,'' and the like.  And in the\nsecond place, the scientific proofs of these hereditary\ntenden<p 30>cies to crime, even apart from the clinical forms of\nmental alienation, are now so numerous that it is useless to\ninsist upon them further.\n\nThe third class is that of the criminals whom, after my prison\nexperience, I have called criminals by contracted habit.  These\nare they who, not presenting the anthropological characteristics\nof the born criminals, or presenting them but slightly, commit\ntheir first crime most commonly in youth, or even in childhood--\nalmost invariably a crime against property, and far more through\nmoral weakness, induced by circumstances and a corrupting\nenvironment, than through inborn and active tendencies.  After\nthis, as M. Joly observes, either they are led on by the impunity\nof their first offences, or, more decisively, prison associations\ndebilitate and corrupt them, morally and physically, the cell\ndegrades them, alcoholism renders them stupid and subject to\nimpulse, and they continually fall back into crime, and become\nchronically prone to it.  And society, which thus abandons them,\nbefore and after they leave their prison, to wretchedness,\nidleness, and temptations, gives them no assistance in their\nstruggle to gain an honest livelihood, even when it does not\nthrust them back into crime by harassing police regulations, which\nprevent them from finding or keeping honest employment.[7]\n\n\n[7] Fliche, ``Comment en devient Criminel,'' Paris, 1886.\n\n\n\nOf those criminals who begin by being occasional criminals, and\nend, after progressive degeneration, by exhibiting the features of\nthe born criminals, Thomas More said, ``What is this but to make\nthieves for the <p 31>pleasure of hanging them?''  And it is just\nthis class of criminals whom measures of social prevention might\nreduce to a minimum, for by abolishing the causes we abolish the\neffects.\n\nApart from their organic and psychological characteristics, innate\nor acquired, there are two bio-sociological symptoms which seem to\nme to be common, though for distinct reasons, to born criminals\nand habitual criminals.  I mean precocity and relapse.  The\noccasional crime and the crime of passion do not, as a rule, occur\nbefore manhood, and rarely or never lead to relapse.\n\nHere are a few figures concerning precocity, derived from\ninternational prison statistics:--\n\n\nPRISONERS UNDER 20 YEARS OF AGE.

Out of 146,217 accused before the tribunals there were 4 per\ncent. under sixteen, and 14 per cent. between sixteen and twenty-\none.  Out of 25,135 females there were 4 per cent. under sixteen,\nand 11 per cent. between sixteen and twenty-one; whilst in 1886\nthe percentages were 3 and 14 of males, 2.5 and 14 of females.\n\nIn Prussia, of persons accused of crimes and offences in 1860-70,\n4 per cent. were under eighteen years.\n\nIn Germany, of persons condemned in 1886, 3 per cent. were between\ntwelve and fifteen, 6 per cent. between fifteen and eighteen, and\n16 per cent. between eighteen and twenty-one years.\n\nIn Italy, out of 5,189 persons condemned at the assizes in 1887, 3\nper cent. were between fourteen and eighteen, and 12 per cent.\nbetween eighteen and twenty-one.  Out of 65,624 tried before the\ntribunals, 1.2 per cent. were under fourteen, 5 per cent. were\nbetween fourteen and eighteen, and 13 per cent. between eighteen\nand twenty-one.  There is a continual increase of precocious\ncriminals in Italy.  Prisoners condemned at the assizes under the\nage of twenty-one stood at 15 per cent. from 1880 to 1887, whilst\nthose of a similar age who were tried before the tribunals rose\nfrom 17 to 20 per cent.\n\nTo these numerical data may be added others of a qualificative\ncharacter, showing that precocity is most frequent in respect of\nthe natural crimes and offences which are usually observed amongst\nborn and habitual criminals.\n<p 33>\n\nIn France the younger prisoners in 1882 had been sentenced in the\nfollowing proportions:--\n\n                                             Male.

Whatever the reason may be, as a matter of fact the thief\nis rarely or never reformed.

But\nit is only a question of terms.  He considers that born and\nhabitual criminals confine themselves almost exclusively to\nserious crime, and occasional criminals to minor offences.  And as\nthe figures which I have given show that precocity and relapse are\neven more frequent for minor offences than for crimes, he thinks\nthat they contradict instead of confirming my conclusions.\n\nThe mere seriousness of an act cannot by any means divide the\ncategories of criminals; for homicide as well as theft, assault\nand battery as well as forgery, may be committed, though in\ndifferent psychological and social conditions, as easily by born\nand habitual criminals as by occasional criminals and criminals of\npassion.\n\nMoreover, the figures which I have given show that precocity and\nrelapse are more frequent in the forms of criminality which, apart\nfrom their gravity, are the common practices of born and habitual\ncriminals, such as murder, homicide, robbery, rape, &c., whilst\nthey are far more uncommon, even if they can be said to be\nobserved at all, in the case of the crimes and offences usually\ncommitted by occasional criminals, such as infanticide, and\ncertain of the offences mentioned above.\n\n\nIt remains to say something of the occasional criminals, and the\ncriminals of passion.\n<p 39>\n\nThe latter are but a variety of the occasional criminals, but\ntheir characteristics are so specific that they may be very\nreadily distinguished.  In fact Lombroso, in his second edition,\nsupplementing the observations of Despine and Bittinger, separated\nthem from other criminals, and classified them according to their\nsymptoms.  I need only summarise his observations.\n\nIn the first place, the criminals who constitute the strongly\nmarked class of criminals by irresistible impulse are very rare,\nand their crimes are almost invariably against the person.  Thus,\nout of 71 criminals of passion inquired into by Lombroso, 69 were\nhomicides, 6 had in addition been convicted of theft, 3 of\nincendiarism, and 1 of rape.\n\nIt may be shown that they number about 5 per cent. of crimes\nagainst the person.\n\nThey are as a rule persons of previous good behaviour, sanguine or\nnervous by temperament, of excessive sensibility, unlike born or\nhabitual criminals, and they are often of a neurotic or epileptoid\ntemperament, of which their crimes may be, strictly speaking, an\nunrecognised consequence.\n\nFrequently they transgress in their youth, especially in the case\nof women, under stress of a passion which suddenly spurns\nconstraint, like anger, or outraged love, or injured honour.  They\nare highly emotional before, during, or after the crime, which\nthey do not commit treacherously, but openly, and often by ill-\nchosen methods, the first that present themselves.  Now and then,\nhowever, one encounters criminals of passion who premeditate a\ncrime, and <p 40>carry it out treacherously, either by reason of\ntheir colder and less impulsive temperament, or as the outcome of\npreconceived ideas or a widespread sentiment, in cases where we\nhave to do with a popular form of lawlessness, such as the\nvendetta.\n\nThis is why the test of premeditation has no absolute value in\ncriminal psychology, as a distinction between the born criminal\nand the criminal of passion; for premeditation depends especially\non the temperament of the individual, and is exemplified in crimes\ncommitted by both anthropological types.\n\nAmongst other symptoms of the criminal of passion, there is also\nthe precise motive which leads to a crime complete in itself, and\nnever as a means of attaining another criminal purpose.\n\nThese offenders immediately acknowledge their crime, with\nunassumed remorse, frequently so keen that they instantly commit,\nor attempt to commit suicide.  When convicted--as they seldom are\nby a jury--they are always repentant prisoners, and amend their\nlives, or do not become degraded, so that in this way they\nencourage superficial observers to affirm as a general fact, and\none possible in all circumstances, that ameliorative effect of\nimprisonment which is really a mere illusion in the case of the\nfar more numerous classes of born and habitual criminals.\n\nIn these same offenders we very rarely observe, if at all, the\norganic anomalies which create a criminal type.  And even the\npsychological characteristics are much slighter in countries where\ncertain crimes of <p 41>passion are endemic, almost ranking\namongst the customs of the community, like the homicides which\noccur in Corsica and Sardinia for the vindication of honour, or\nthe political assassinations in Russia and Ireland.\n\n\nThe last class is that of occasional criminals, who without any\ninborn and active tendency to crime lapse into crime at an early\nage through the temptation of their personal condition, and of\ntheir physical and social environment, and who do not lapse into\nit, or do not relapse, if these temptations disappear.\n\nThus they commit those crimes and offences which do not indicate\nnatural criminality, or else crimes and offences against person or\nproperty, but under personal and social conditions altogether\ndifferent from those in which they are committed by born and\nhabitual criminals.\n\nThere is no doubt that, even with the occasional criminal, some of\nthe causes which lead him into crime belong to the anthropological\nclass; for external causes would not suffice without individual\npredispositions.  For instance, during a scarcity or a hard\nwinter, not all of those who experience privation have recourse to\ntheft, but some prefer to endure want, however undeserved, without\nceasing to be honest, whilst others are at the utmost driven to\nbeg their food; and amongst those who yield to the suggestion of\ncrime, some stop short at simple theft, whilst others go as far as\nrobbery with violence.\n\nBut the true difference between the born and the occasional\ncriminal is that, with the former, the <p 42>external cause is\nless operative than the internal tendency, because this tendency\npossesses, as it were, a centrifugal force, driving the individual\nto commit crime, whilst, for the occasional criminal, it is rather\na case of feeble power of resistance against external causes, to\nwhich most of the inducement to crime is due.\n\nThe casual provocation of crime in the born criminal is generally\nthe outcome of an instinct or tendency already existing, and far\nmore of a pretext than an occasion of crime.  With the occasional\ncriminal, on the other hand, it is the casual provocation which\nmatures, no doubt in a favouring soil, the growth of criminal\ntendencies not previously developed.\n\nFor this reason Lombroso calls the occasional criminals\n``criminaloids,'' in order to show precisely that they have a\ndistinctly abnormal constitution, though in a less degree than the\nborn criminals, just as we have the metal and the metalloid, the\nepileptic and the epileptoid.\n\nAnd this, again, is the reason why Lombroso's criticisms on my\ndescription of occasional criminals are lacking in force.  He\nsays, as Benedikt said at the Congress at Rome, that all criminals\nare criminals by birth, so that there is no such thing as an\noccasional criminal, in the sense of a _*normal_ individual\ncasually launched into crime.  But I have not, any more than\nGarofalo, drawn such a picture of the occasional criminal, for as\na matter of fact I have said precisely the opposite, as indeed\nLombroso himself acknowledges a little further on (ii. 422),\n<p 43>namely, that between the born and the occasional criminal\nthere is only a difference of degree and modality, as in all the\ncriminal classes.\n\nTo cite a few details of criminal psychology, it may be stated\nthat of the two physiological conditions of crime, moral\ninsensibility and improvidence, occasional crime is especially due\nto the latter, and inborn and habitual crime to the former.  With\nthe born criminal it is, above all, the lack or the weakness of\nmoral sense which fails to withstand crime, whereas with the\noccasional criminal the moral sense is almost normal, but\ninability to realise beforehand the consequences of his act causes\nhim to yield to external influences.\n\nEvery man, however pure and honest he may be, is conscious now and\nthen of a transitory notion of some dishonest or criminal action.\nBut with the honest man, exactly because he is physically and\nmorally normal, this notion of crime, which simultaneously summons\nup the idea of its grievous consequences, glances off the surface\nof the normal conscience, and is a mere flash without the thunder.\nWith the man who is less normal and has less forethought, the\nnotion dwells, resists the weak repulsion of a not too vigorous\nmoral sense, and finally prevails; for, as Victor Hugo says,\n``Face to face with duty, to hesitate is to be lost.''[11]\n\n\n[11] For instance, I will recall a fact which Morel has related of\nhimself, how one day, as he was crossing a bridge in Paris, he saw\na working-man gazing into the water, and a homicidal idea flashed\nacross his mind, so that he had to hurry away, for fear of\nyielding to the temptation to throw the man into the water.\nAgain, there is the case of Humboldt's nurse, who was attacked one\nday by the temptation to kill her charge, and ran with him to his\nmother in order to avoid a <p 44>disaster.  Brierre de Boismont\nalso tells us of a learned man who, at the sight of a picture in a\npublic gallery, was tempted to cut the canvas, and ran away from\nhis impulse to crime.\n\n<p 44>\n\nThe criminal of passion is one who is strong enough to resist\nordinary temptations of no exceptional force, to which the\noccasional criminal would yield, but who does not resist\npsychological storms which indeed are sometimes actually\nirresistible.\n\nThe forms of occasional criminality, which are determined by these\nordinary temptations, are also determined by age, sex, poverty,\nworldly influences, influences of moral environment, alcoholism,\npersonal surroundings, and imitation.  Tarde has ably demonstrated\nthe persistent influence of these conditions on the actions of\nmen.\n\nIn this connection, Lombroso has drawn a clear distinction between\ntwo varieties of occasional criminals: the ``pseudo-criminals,''\nor normal human beings who commit involuntary offences, or\noffences which do not spring from perversity, and do not hurt\nsociety, though they are punishable by law, and ``criminaloids,''\nwho commit ordinary offences, but differ from true criminals for\nthe reasons already given.\n\n\nA final observation is necessary in regard to this anthropological\nclassification of criminals, and it meets various objections\nraised by our syllogistic critics.  The difference existing\namongst the five categories is only one of degree, and depends\nupon their organic and psychological types, and upon the influence\nof physical and social environment.\n\nIn every natural classification the differences <p 45>between\nvarious groups and varieties are never anything but relative.\nThis deprives them of none of their theoretical and practical\nimportance, and so it is with this anthropological classification\nof criminals.\n\nIt follows that, as in natural history we advance by degrees and\nshades from the inorganic to the organic creation, life beginning\nin the mineral domain with the laws of crystallisation, so in\ncriminal anthropology we pass by degrees and shades from the mad\nto the born criminal, through the links of moral madmen and\nepileptics; and from the born criminal to the occasional, through\nthe link of the habitual criminal, who begins by being an\noccasional criminal, and ends by acquiring and transmitting to his\nchildren the characteristics of the born criminal.  And finally,\nwe pass from the occasional criminal to the criminal of passion,\nwho is but a species of the other, and who further, with his\nneurotic and epileptoid temperament, not infrequently approximates\nto the criminal of unsound mind.\n\nThus in our everyday life, as in science, we very often find\nintermediate types, for complete and unmixed types are always the\nmost uncommon.  And whilst legislators and judges, in their\ncomplacent psychology, exact and establish marked lines of\ncleavage between the sane and the insane criminal, experts in\npsychiatry and anthropology are often constrained to place a\nprisoner somewhere between the mad and the born criminal, or\nbetween the occasional criminal and the normal man.\n\nBut it is evident that even when a criminal cannot be classed\nprecisely in one or the other category, and <p 46>stands between\nthe two, this is in itself a sufficiently definite classification,\nespecially from a sociological point of view.  There is\nconsequently no weight in the objection of those who, basing their\nargument on an abstract and nebulous idea of the criminal in\ngeneral, and judging him merely according to the crime which has\nbeen committed, without knowing his personal characteristics and\nthe circumstances of his environment, affirm that criminal\nanthropology cannot classify all who are detained and accused.\n\nIn my experience, however, as a counsel and as an observer, I have\nnever had any difficulty in classifying all persons detained or\ncondemned for crimes and offences, by relying upon organic, and\nespecially upon psychological symptoms.\n\nThus, as Garofalo recently said, whilst the accepted criminal\nscience recognises only two terms, the offence and the punishment,\ncriminal sociology on the other hand recognises three: the crime,\nthe criminal, and the means best calculated for social self-\ndefence.  And it may be concluded that up to this time, science,\nlegislation, and, in a minor degree, but without any scientific\nmethod, the administration of justice, have judged and punished\ncrime in the person of the criminal, but that hereafter it will be\nnecessary to judge the criminal as well as the crime.\n\n\nAfter these general observations on the anthropological classes of\ncriminals, it might seem necessary to establish their respective\nnumerical proportions.  But as there is no absolute separation\nbetween one <p 47>and another, and as the frequency of the several\ncriminal types varies according to the crimes or offences, natural\nor otherwise, against persons or property, no precise account can\nbe rendered of the criminal world as a whole.\n\nBy way of approximation, however, it may be said in the first\nplace that the classes of mad criminals and criminals of passion\nare the least numerous, and represent something like 5 or 10 per\ncent. of the total.\n\nOn the other hand, we have seen that born and habitual criminals\nare about 40 or 50 per cent.; so that the occasional criminals\nwould also be between 40 and 50 per cent.\n\nThese are figures which naturally vary according to the different\ngroups of crime and of criminals which come under observation, and\nwhich cannot be more accurately determined without a series of\nspecial studies in criminal anthropology, as I said when answering\nthe objections which have been raised against the methods of this\nnovel science.\n\nIt remains for us, before concluding our first chapter, to\nestablish a fact of great scientific and practical value.  This is\nthat, after the anthropological classification which I have\nmaintained for some ten years past, all who have been devoting\nthemselves to the subject of crime as regarded from a biological\nand social standpoint have recognised the need for a\nclassification less simple than that of habitual and occasional\ncriminals, and which will be more or less complex according to the\ncriterion which may be adopted.\n<p 48>\n\nIn the first place, the necessity is generally recognised of\nabandoning the old arbitrary and algebraic type in favour of a\nclassification which shall correspond more accurately with the\nfacts of the case.  This classification, originating in\nobservations made within the prison walls, I have extended in the\ndomain of criminal sociology, wherein it is now established as a\nfundamental criterion of legislative measures which must be taken\nas a protection against criminals, as well as a criterion of their\nresponsibility.\n\nSecondly, the classifications of criminals hitherto given are not\nessentially and integrally distinct.  It has been seen, as a\nmatter of fact, that all the classifications which have been set\nforth amount to a recognition of four types, the born, the insane,\nthe occasional criminals, and the criminals of passion; and this\nagain resolves itself into the simple and primitive distinction\nbetween occasional and instinctive criminals.  The category of\ncriminals by contracted habit would not be accepted by all\nobservers, but it corresponds too closely to our daily experience\nto stand in need of further proof.  And on the other hand I must\nfrankly decline to accept the authority of those who put forward\nclassifications more or less symmetrical without having made a\ndirect study of criminals; for the experimental method does not\nadmit systems based on mere imagination, or on vague recollections\nof criminal trials, or on argumentative constructions built up\nfrom the systems of others.\n\nAs a matter of fact, apart from the differences <p 49>of\nnomenclature, it is evident that the partial discrepancies in this\nanthropological classification of criminals are due in some\nmeasure to the different points of view taken by observers.  For\ninstance, the classification of Lacassagne, Joly, Krauss, Badik,\nand Marro rest upon a purely descriptive criterion of the organic\nor psychological characteristics of criminals.  The\nclassifications of Liszt, Medem, and Minzloff, on the other hand,\ndepend solely upon the curative and defensive influence of\npunishment; and those of Foehring and Starke upon certain special\npoints of view, such as the assistance of released prisoners, on\ntheir tendency to relapse.\n\nMy own point of view, on the contrary, has been general and\nreproductive, for my classification is based upon the natural\ncauses of crime, individual, physical, and social, and to this\nextent it corresponds more closely with the theoretical and\npractical requirements of criminal sociology.  If the curative art\nof society, like that of individuals, expects from positive\nknowledge an indication of remedies, it is clear that a\nclassification based on the fundamental causes of crime is best\nfitted to indicate a social cure for this manifestation of\ndisease, which is the essential object of criminal sociology.\nFor, as in biology one is carried from purely descriptive anatomy\nto genetic anatomy and physiology, so in sociology we must pass on\nfrom purely legal descriptions of crimes to the genetic knowledge\nof the criminals who commit these crimes.\n\nFor this reason all the chief classifications of criminals, as has\nbeen seen, may be brought into <p 50>line with my own, by virtue\nof the more complete and fruitful test which has established it.\nAnd thus we have a manifest proof that this classification\nactually represents the common and permanent basis of all the\nchief anthropological categories of criminals, whether in regard\nto their natural causality and their specific character, or in\nregard to the different forms of social self-defence which spring\nout of them, and which must be adapted to the natural causes of\ncrime, and to the principal criminal types.\n\nBut whatever classification may be accepted, we shall always have,\nas the fundamental axiom of criminal anthropology, this variety in\nthe types of criminals, which must henceforth be indispensable to\nall who are theoretically or practically concerned with crime.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\n_THE DATA OF CRIMINAL STATISTICS._\n\nFOR moral and social facts, unlike physical and biological facts,\nexperiment is very difficult, and frequently even impossible;\nobservation in this domain brings the greatest aid to scientific\nresearch.  And statistics are amongst the most efficacious\ninstruments of such observation.\n\nIt is natural, therefore, that criminal sociology, after studying\nthe individual aspect of the natural genesis of crime, should have\nrecourse to criminal statistics for the study of the social\naspect.  Statistical information in the words of Krohne, ``is the\nfirst condition of success in opposing the armies of crime, for it\ndischarges the same function as the Intelligence department in\nwar.''\n\nFrom statistics, in fact, the modern idea of the close relation\nbetween offences and the conditions of social life, in some of its\naspects, and above all in certain particular forms, has most\ndirectly sprung.\n\nThe science of criminal statistics is to criminal sociology what\nhistology is to biology, for it exhibits, in the conditions of the\nindividual elements of the collective organism, the factors of\ncrime as a<p 51> <p 52>social phenomenon.  And that not only for\nscientific inductions, but also for practical and legislative\npurposes; for, as Lord Brougham said at the London Statistical\nCongress in 1860, ``criminal statistics are for the legislator\nwhat the chart and the compass are for the navigator.''\n\n\nThe experimental school, accepting the fundamental and\nincontestible idea, apart from its numerical and optimistic\nexaggerations, that the statistics of crime must be considered in\nregard to the growth and activity of the population, has opened up\nan entirely new channel of fruitful observations, in the\nclassification and study of the natural factors of crime.\n\nIn my ``Studies of Crime in France'' (1881) I arranged in three\nnatural orders the whole series of causes leading to crime, which\nhad previously been indicated in a fragmentary and incomplete\nmanner.[12]\n\n\n\n[12] Bentham, in his ``Introduction to the Principles of Morals\nand Legislation,'' enumerates the following circumstances as\nnecessary to be considered in legislation:--temperament, health,\nstrength, physical imperfections, culture, intellectual faculties,\nstrength of mind, dispositions, ideas of honour and religion,\nfeelings of sympathy and antipathy, insanity, economic conditions,\nsex, age, social status, education, profession, climate, race,\ngovernment, religious profession.\n\nLombroso, in the second edition of his ``Criminal,'' which\nembraces all the divisions of his classical work, has made but a\nrapid enumeration of the principal points:--race civilisation,\npoverty, heredity, age sex, civil status, profession, education,\norganic anomalies, sensations imitation.  Morselli, treating of\nsuicide, has given a fuller classification of its contributory\ncauses:--worldly or natural influences, ethnical or demographical\ninfluences, social influences, biopsychical influences.\n\n\n\nFrom the consideration that human actions, whether honest or\ndishonest, social or anti-social, are always the outcome of a\nman's physio-psychical organism, and of the physical and social\natmosphere which surrounds him, I have drawn attention to\n<p 53>the _anthropological_ or individual factors of crime, the\n_physical_ factors, and the _social_ factors.\n\nThe anthropological factors, inherent in the individual criminal,\nare the first condition of crime; and they may be divided into\nthree sub-classes, according as we regard the criminal organically\nphysically, or socially.\n\n_The organic constitution of the criminal_ comprises all anomalies\nof the skull, the brain, the vital organs, the sensibility, and\nthe reflex activity, and all the bodily characteristics taken\ntogether, such as the physiognomy, tattooing, and so on.\n\n_The mental constitution of the criminal_ comprises anomalies of\nintelligence and feeling, especially of the moral sense, and the\nspecialities of criminal writing and slang.\n\n_The personal characteristics of the criminal_ comprise his purely\nbiological conditions, such as race, age, sex; bio-social\nconditions, such as civil status, profession, domicile, social\nrank, instruction, education, which have hitherto been regarded as\nalmost the exclusive concern of criminal statistics.\n\n_The physical factors_ of crime are climate, the nature of the\nsoil, the relative length of day and night, the seasons, the\naverage temperature, meteoric conditions, agricultural pursuits.\n\n_The social factors_ comprise the density of population; public\nopinion, manners and religion; family circumstances; the system of\neducation; industrial pursuits; alcoholism; economic and political\nconditions; public administration, justice and police; and in\ngeneral, legislative, civil and penal institutions.  <p 54>We have\nhere a host of latent causes, commingling and combining in all\nparts of the social organism, which generally escape the notice\nboth of theorists and of practical men, of criminologists and of\nlegislators.\n\nThis classification of the natural factors of crime, which has\nindeed been accepted by almost all criminal anthropologists and\nsociologists, seems to me more precise and complete than any other\nwhich has been proposed.\n\nIn respect of this classification of the natural factors of crime,\nit is necessary to make two final observations as to the practical\nresults which may be obtained in the struggle for just laws and\nagainst the transgression of them.\n\nIn the first place, owing to ``the discovery of the unexpected\nrelation amongst the various forces of nature, which had\npreviously been thought to be independent,'' we must lay stress on\nthis positive deduction, that we cannot find an adequate reason\neither for a single crime or for the aggregate criminality of a\nnation if we do not take into account each and all of the\ndifferent natural factors, which we may isolate in the exigencies\nof our studies, but which always act together in an indissoluble\nunion.\n\nNo crime, whoever commits it, and in whatever circumstances, can\nbe explained except as the outcome of individual free-will, or as\nthe natural effect of natural causes.  Since the former of these\nexplanations has no scientific value, it is impossible to give a\nscientific explanation of a crime (or indeed of any <p 55>other\naction of man or brute) unless it is considered as the product of\na particular organic and psychical constitution, acting in a\nparticular physical and social environment.\n\nTherefore it is far from being exact to assert that the positive\ncriminal school reduces crime to a purely and exclusively\nanthropological phenomenon.  As a matter of fact, this school has\nalways from the beginning maintained that crime is the effect of\nanthropological, physical, and social conditions, which evolve it\nby their simultaneous and inseparable operation.  And if inquiries\ninto biological conditions have been more abundant and more\nconspicuous by their novelty, this in no way contradicts the\nfundamental conclusion of criminal sociology.\n\nThat being stated, we have still to examine the relative value of\nthese three classes of conditions in the natural evolution of\ncrime.\n\nIt seems to me that this question is generally stated\ninaccurately, and also that it cannot be answered absolutely, and\nin a word.\n\nIt is generally stated inaccurately; because they who think, for\ninstance, that crime is nothing else than a purely and exclusively\nsocial phenomenon in the evolution of which the organic and\npsychical anomalies of the criminal have had no part, ignore more\nor less consciously the universal correlation of natural forces,\nand forget that, in regard to any phenomenon whatsoever, it is\nimpossible to set an absolute limit to the network of its causes,\nimmediate and remote, direct and indirect.\n\nTo put this question in an arbitrary sense would <p 56>be like\nasking if a mammal is the product of its lungs, or its heart, or\nits stomach, or of vegetable constituents, or of the atmosphere;\nwhereas each of these conditions, internal and external, is\nnecessary to the life of the animal.\n\nIn fact, if crime were the exclusive product of the social\nenvironment, how could one explain the familiar fact that in the\nsame social environment, and in identical circumstances of\npoverty, abandonment, lack of education, sixty per cent. do not\ncommit crimes, and, of the other forty, five prefer suicide, five\ngo mad, five simply become beggars or tramps not dangerous to\nsociety, whilst the remaining twenty-five actually commit crimes?\nAnd amongst the latter, whilst some go no further than theft\nwithout violence, why do others commit theft with violence, and\neven kill their victim outright, before he offers resistance, or\nthreatens them, or calls for help, and this with no other object\nthan gain?\n\nThe secondary differences of social condition, which may be\nobserved even amongst the members of a single family, rotting in\none of the slums of our great towns, or amongst those who are\nsurrounded by the temptations of money or power, or the like, are\nclearly not enough in themselves to explain the vast differences\nin the actions which grow out of them, varying from honesty under\nthe greatest discouragement to suicide and murder.\n\nThe question, therefore, must be asked in a relative sense\naltogether, and we must inquire which of the three kinds of\nnatural causes of crime has a <p 57>greater or less influence in\ndetermining each particular crime at any given moment in the\nindividual and social life.\n\nNo clear answer of general application can be given to this\nquestion, for the relative influence of the anthropological,\nphysical, and social conditions varies with the psychological and\nsocial characteristics of each offence against the law.\n\nFor instance, if we consider the three great classes of crimes\nagainst the person, against property, and against personal purity,\nit is evident that each class of determining causes, but\nespecially the biological and social conditions, have a distinctly\ndifferent influence in evolving homicide, theft, or indecent\nassaults.  And so it is in every category of crimes.\n\nThe undeniable influence of social conditions, and still more of\neconomic conditions, in leading up to the commission of theft, is\nfar inferior in the genesis of homicides and indecent assaults.\nAnd similarly, in each category of crimes, the influence of the\ndetermining conditions varies greatly according to the special\nforms of crime.\n\nCertain casual homicides are plainly the result of social\nconditions (gambling, drink, public opinion, &c.) in a much higher\ndegree than homicides which for the most part spring from\nbrutality, from the moral insensibility of individuals, or from\ntheir psycho-pathological conditions, corresponding to abnormal\norganic conditions.\n\nIn like manner, certain indecent assaults, incests, &c., are\nlargely the outcome of social environment, which, condemning a\nnumber of persons to live in <p 58>hovels without air or light,\nwith a promiscuity of sex between parents and children such as\nobtains amongst the brutes, effaces or deadens all normal sense of\nmodesty.  On the other hand, there are cases of rape and the like\nwhich are mostly due to the biological condition of the\nindividual, either in manifest forms of sexual disease or, less\nmanifest though none the less actual, of biological anomaly.\n\nFor thefts, again, whilst occasional simple thefts are largely the\neffect of social and economical conditions, this influence becomes\nfeebler in comparison with impulses due to the personal\nconstitution, organic and psychical, as, for instance, in the case\nof thefts with violence, and especially of murder for the purpose\nof robbery, which scoundrels of the ``swell-mob'' so frequently\ncommit in cold blood.\n\nThe same observation applies to the conditions of physical\nenvironment.  For instance, if the regular increase of crimes\nagainst property in winter (and, as I showed for the first time\nfrom French statistics, in years when the cold is greatest) is\nonly an indirect result, through the social and economic\ninfluences of temperature, the increase of crimes of passion and\nindecent assaults during the months and years when the temperature\nis highest is only a direct effect of temperature, even for such\nas, by their biological conditions, offer the feeblest resistance\nto these influences.\n\nMeanwhile, a last objection has been raised against the\nconclusions which I have maintained for many years past.\n\nIt has been said that, even if we admit that for <p 59>certain\ncrimes and criminals the greatest influence must be recognised as\ndue to the physical and psychical conditions of the individual,\nextending from slightly manifested anomalies of an anthropological\ncharacter to the most accentuated pathological condition, this\ndoes not exclude the possibility of a crime being due to social\nconditions.  In fact, it is said the anomalies of the individual\nare in their turn only an effect of a debasing social environment,\nwhich condemns its victims to organic and psychical degeneration.\n\nThis objection is sound enough if it be taken in a relative sense,\nbut groundless if it be insisted on absolutely.\n\nIt must be considered, in the first place, that the distinctions\nof cause and effect are only relative, for every effect has its\ncause, and _vice vers<a^>_; so that if wretchedness, material and\nmoral, is a cause of degeneration, degeneration itself, like\nbiological anomaly, is a cause of wretchedness.  And in this sense\nthe question would be simply metaphysical, like the famous\nByzantine discussions as to whether there was originally an egg\nbefore a hen or a hen before an egg.\n\nAnd, in fact, when it was said, in regard to criminal geography,\nthat the extent and quality of crime in such and such a province,\ninstead of being the effect of biological conditions (race, &c.)\nand physical conditions (climate, soil, &c.), were but the effect\nof social and economic conditions (of rural and industrial\npursuits, and the like), I was able to make a very simple reply.\nFor, apart even from statistical proofs, if the <p 60>social\nconditions of such and such a province, which have an\nunquestionable influence, are really the absolute and exclusive\ncause of crime, we may still ask whether these social conditions\nof the province are not themselves the effect of the ethnical\nqualities of energy, intelligence, and so forth, in its\ninhabitants, and of the more or less favourable conditions of the\nclimate and the soil.\n\nBut it may also be observed, more precisely, that even apart from\nstrongly marked and conspicuous pathological conditions, which\nmeanwhile assert themselves amongst the biological factors of\ncrime, there is a very great number of these cases in which it\ncannot actually be said that the bio-psychical anomalies of the\ncriminal are the effect of a physically and morally poisonous\nenvironment.\n\nIn every family in which there are several children, we find (in\nspite of identical surroundings and conditions of a favourable\nkind, and suitable methods of training and education), individuals\nwho differ intellectually from the cradle; we also find in the\ndegree or in the kind of their talent, the same individuals also\ndiffer from their cradle in physical and moral constitution.  And\nthough the phenomenon may only be manifest in the less numerous\ncases of types which are markedly normal or abnormal, it is none\nthe less true also in the more numerous cases of ordinary types.\n\nIn this connection I may observe that physical and social\nconditions have a greater or a less influence in proportion as the\nphysical and psychical constitution of the individual is more or\nless sound and vigorous.\n<p 61>\n\nThe practical conclusion, therefore, of these general observations\non the natural genesis of crime is this:  Every crime is the\nresult of individual physical and social conditions; and, since\nthese conditions have a more or less dominant influence for\nvarious forms of crime, the most certain and profitable mode of\ndefence which society can employ against criminality is of a\ntwofold character, and both modes ought to be employed and brought\ninto action simultaneously--in the first place, the amelioration\nof the social conditions, as a natural preventive of crime, in the\nnature of a substitute for punishment; and, secondly, measures of\nperpetual or temporary elimination of criminals, according as the\ninfluence of biological conditions in the evolution of crime is\nall but absolute, or more or less great, and more or less curable.\n\nAs a matter of fact, when we follow the periodic variations of\ncrime, with its measured growth and decrease, we cannot fail to\nconclude that these constant and constantly occurring variations\ndepend upon a corresponding variation of anthropological and\nphysical factors.  For, whilst criminal statistics are far from\nshowing the regularity which Quetelet claimed with much\nexaggeration, the proportional figures in regard to the bearings\nof age, sex, calling, &c., upon criminality exhibit very\ninsignificant variations from year to year.  And as for the\nphysical factors, if marked variations are explicable at some\ngiven period, it is nevertheless evident that neither climate, nor\nthe nature of the soil, nor atmospheric conditions, nor the\nseasons, nor the temperature of different years could have\nundergone in the last half-<p 62>century such constant and\nrepeated variations as to correspond to those waves of criminality\nwhich we shall presently exhibit in almost every nation of Europe.\n\nThus it is to the social factors that we must chiefly attribute\nthe periodic variations of criminality.  For even the variations\nwhich can be detected in certain anthropological factors, like the\ninfluences of age and sex upon crime, and the more or less marked\noutbreak of anti-social and pathological tendencies, depend in\ntheir turn upon social factors, such as the protection accorded to\nabandoned infants, the participation of women in non-domestic,\ncommercial and industrial life, preventive and repressive\nmeasures, and the like.  And again, since the social factors have\nspecial import in occasional crime, and crime by acquired habit,\nand since these are the most numerous sections of crime as a\nwhole, it is clear that the periodic movement of crime must be\nattributed in the main to the social factors.  So true is this,\nthat, as we shall presently see, the gravest crimes, especially\nagainst persons, precisely because they mostly indicate congenital\ncriminality, follow a more steady and regular movement than these\nslighter but far more frequent offences against property, public\norder, and persons, of a more occasional character, and that, as\nmicrobes of the world of crime, they are the more direct outcome\nof social environment.\n\nIt is therefore another point in favour of the experimental school\nthat it has insisted on this sociological aspect of the problem of\ncriminality, by showing <p 63>legislators, outside the limits of\ntheir punitive remedies, as easy as they are illusory, how they\nmight, as far as circumstances will permit, apply a genuine social\nremedy to crime.\n\n\nAfter these preliminary observations, it is time that we should\ntake a closer view of the general statistics of the movement of\ncrime in Europe, so far as they may be followed in official\nfigures.\n\nWhilst we have no intention of offering a body of comparative\nstatistics, but only of giving a simple indication of the periodic\nmovement of crime, these data, which do not render it easy to\ncompare one country with another, though they are intimately\nrelated so far as each particular country is concerned, suffice to\nexhibit a few facts of some considerable importance.\n\nThe most conspicuous general phenomenon in the countries here\nincluded is _the steadiness of the gravest forms of crime side by\nside with the continuous increase of slighter offences_,\nespecially in the countries which show a long series of figures,\nsuch as France, England, and Belgium.  This proceeds mainly from\nthe progressive accumulation of offences against special\nenactments, which are constantly being added to the original basis\nof the penal code; but it is also a symptom of an actual\ntransformation in the criminal activity of the century, from\nwhence, through the gradual substitution of crimes against\nproperty in the great towns for crimes against the person in\nearlier centuries, we have a wider extension together with a lower\ndegree of intensity.\n<p 64>\n\nAnother characteristic common to the countries under observation\nis that, whilst the graver crimes against property show a somewhat\nmarked diminution, crimes against persons, on the other hand, show\nmore steadiness, either of regularity, as in France and Belgium,\nor of increase, as in England, and still more in Germany.  But\nthis phenomenon in the case of crimes against the person is in\nactual correspondence with criminal activity arising from an\nincrease of population.  On the other hand--apart from the\ntransformation of crimes of violence into crimes of craft and\nfraud, due to the increase of movable property--the decrease of\noffences against property is no more than the manifest effect of\nan artificial change of judicial procedure, summary proceedings\ntaking the place of trial by jury.\n\nAn alternation, which is not invalidated by exceptions here and\nthere, has been observed in the criminality of different\ncountries, in the periodic movement of crimes and offences against\nproperty and those against the person, of such a kind that years\nof increase in the former usually answer to a diminution in the\nlatter, and _vice vers<a^>_.  The principal factors in the annual\nincrease of theft, such as scarcity and extremes of weather, cause\na corresponding diminution of violent assaults and bodily harm, of\nhomicides and indecent assaults, and _vice vers<a^>_.  On the\nother hand, offences against property, which are very numerous,\ncontribute most of all to the total of annual crime; so that the\nmaximum of 1880 in Italy, as well as in France, Belgium and\nAustria, is especially due to the great severity of the\n<p 65>winter of 1879-80, which in Italy coincided with an\nagricultural crisis, attested by the very high price of corn.\nWhereas from 1881 to 1885 there were very mild winters, with more\nabundant harvests, and from 1886 a greater extreme of cold and a\nmore acute economic crisis.\n\nThe general tendency of these periodic oscillations of crime in\nItaly, as in other European countries, is nevertheless far more\ntowards increase than towards decrease.  This is also shown by the\nproportional triennial averages of crimes and offences placed on\nrecord, and of persons condemned to imprisonment.\n\nIn the movement of crime in each country it is necessary to\ndistinguish special oscillations, more or less prolonged, of\nincrease or decrease, from its general and permanent tendency.\nThe latter is determined by the fundamental conditions of each\nnation, physical and social, apart from the purely artificial\nsection of transgressions brought into existence by new laws.  The\nspecial oscillations, on the other hand, are determined by the\nannual variations in this or that factor of the more numerous\noffences; that is to say, by abundance or scantiness of the\nharvests, by the annual variations of temperature, by industrial\nand political crises, and the like.\n\nThe oblivion of this marked distinction, coupled with the\nprejudices of the scientific schools, and even of political\nparties, leads to some curious disagreements, and to lively\ndiscussions on the results of criminal statistics.  For on one\nside the champions of the classical school plainly see that the\npersistent <p 66>increase of crimes and offences amounts to a\nproof of that breakdown of penal systems, practical and\ntheoretical, which have hitherto been applied--as was admitted by\nHoltzendorff.  And on the other hand, the increase of crimes is\ndenied or affirmed for the purpose of supporting or attacking some\nparticular ministry.  For, in parliaments more than elsewhere,\nthere is always a deep-seated and vivacious prejudice, a kind of\nsocial artificiality, which causes men to think that the condition\nof States, moral and economic, is fundamentally determined far\nmore by the action of this or that government than by natural\nfactors, which are mainly superior to and outside of governments\nand politicians.\n\nAnd this is why in Italy there has been much discussion of late,\nin scientific publications, at the sittings of the Central\nCommission of Judicial Statistics, and even in Parliament, as to\nwhether crime was increasing or decreasing.\n\nBeltrani-Scalia and Lombroso almost simultaneously called\nattention to the growth of Italian crime, and they were succeeded\nby various adherents of the positive school, such as Ferri,\nGarofalo, Pavia, Pugliese, Guidi, Bournet, Barzilai, and Rossi,\nwho produced evidence that the general tendency of crime in Italy\nwas to increase, and that the diminutions observed after 1880 were\nmere transitory oscillations; and after 1886 they were justified\nby facts.\n\nOn the other hand, official returns of criminal statistics, and a\nmajority of the members of the Central Commission, when pursuing\nan inquiry suggested by myself into Italian crime since 1873\n<p 67>--for previously to this date there are no criminal\nstatistics in Italy except for 1853 and 1869-70--came to the\nconclusion that there was a tendency towards a diminution of\ncrime.  But their decision was formed from an entirely partial\nstandpoint, which they had taken up in the exigency of polemical\ndiscussion.  They compared, in fact, the years just concluded,\n1881-5, with 1880, and thus it naturally followed that after a\nmaximum they had a relative decrease.  And it was only this\ningenious comparison which gave an appearance of actual proof to\ntheir optimistic assertions; for when a fever is at forty degrees,\nthe fall of even half a degree is very important.  They paid\nspecial attention to the so-called high criminality, which is\ntried by the Assize courts, and is actually decreasing, though by\nthe purely artificial effect of more and more effective measures\nof correction.  But I have always maintained, and I have the\nsupport of M. Oettingen, that we cannot separate crimes and\noffences tried by the Assizes from those tried by the Tribunals,\nfor there is only a difference of degree between them, as is clear\nin regard to theft, assaults and wounding, forgery and the like.\n\nIt is a curious fact that similar illusions have existed in all\ncountries through the same causes and prejudices which have been\nmentioned above.  In France, for instance, we often find that the\nkeepers of the seals, reporting on volumes of the excellent and\nvaluable series of criminal statistics since the year 1826,\noccasionally remark on these oscillatory diminutions, and make a\npoint of treating them as <p 68>signs of a constant and general\ntendency, which succeeding years have always contradicted.\n\nIn France also, the same controversy has been kept up since 1840,\nwith the same polemical artifices as were employed more recently\nin Italy, on the question whether crime has increased or\ndecreased.  Dufau, B<e'>ranger, Berrzat de St. Prix, and Legoyt\naffirmed that it had diminished since 1826, against the true\nopinion of de Metz, Dupin, Chassan, Mesuard, and Fayet, the last\nof whom quotes the others in one of his essays on criminal\nstatistics, now undeservedly forgotten, though they abound in\nstriking and profound observation.\n\nBut, as for France in those days, so for Italy to-day, the\nstatistics of succeeding years quickly proved that what official\noptimism and national self-complacency spoke of as pessimism on\nour part was but a conscientious inference from lamentable facts,\nestablished in every country by the influence of civilisation on\ncrime, which I have described in preceding pages.\n\nAfter these general statements we ought logically to watch the\nperiodic movement of each leading category of crimes and offences\nin each division of the country; for not all crimes, nor all\ndistricts, pursue the same course from year to year.  But as this\ninquiry is impossible in the present work, we may pass on to the\ngeneral figures for other European countries.\n\n                    FRANCE.\n                                1826-8. 1895-7.\nPolice Contraventions   ... ... ... 100     391   |\nOffences    ... ... ... ... ... ... 100     397   |\nCrimes against the person   ... ... 100     98    |in 61 years\n    ''        property  ... ... ... 100     41    |\n<p 69>\n                    BELGIUM.\n                                1850-2. 1883-5.\nTried by the Correctional Tribunals,\n    for crimes against the person   soO log t in 36 years\n        '' property     ...

Indeed, crimes against the\nperson, in which there is less power of election, do not exhibit\nso marked a decrease; and accordingly we see that in Belgium the\nincrease of ``correctionalised'' crimes is due far more to crimes\nagainst property (62 per cent in 36 years) than to those against\nthe person (9 per cent.).\n\nOn the other hand, the growth of slighter delinquency is partly\nthe effect of special enactments, which are constantly creating\nnew infractions, offences or contraventions.  For France may be\nmentioned the law of 1832 on eluding supervision, that of 1844 on\nthe game laws, that of 1857 on the false description of goods for\nsale, of 1845 on railway offences, of 1849 on the expulsion of\nrefugees, of 1873 on drunkenness, and of 1874 on requisition of\nhorses.  I dealt with the statistical results of these laws, and\nwith the influence of the increasing number of police\n<p 71>agents, in my ``Studies on Criminality in France'' (Rome,\n1881); and I will here add only a single observation.  If it is\ntrue, as M. Joly says, that other laws, passed since 1826, have\nextinguished a few offences, or at least have diminished their\nfrequency under less severe regulations, yet it is also true that\nthe new infractions created in the past half-century show far\nhigher numbers than those of the infractions which have been\nextinguished or rendered less easy.  So that amongst the 297 per\ncent. of increase on the offences tried in France between 1826 and\n1887, the element due to legal creation of new infractions must\nnot be ignored.\n\nIt cannot, however, be denied that for certain more frequent\noffences we have a real and very noteworthy increase, apart from\nany legislative or statistical cause of disturbance.\n\nThe same observation may be made in regard to England.  There also\nthe increase of 76 per cent, during thirty years of offences tried\nsummarily is due in part to new infractions, created by special\nlegislation, and especially by the Education Act of 1873, under\nwhich there were more than forty thousand infractions in 1878, and\nmore than sixty-five thousand in 1886.\n\nIn regard to this delinquency in England (wherein are included,\nover and above real offences, certain infractions corresponding to\nthe police contraventions of the Italian, French, Belgian and\nAustrian codes) it is to be observed that the increase of 76 per\ncent. in thirty years is due rather to contraventions than to\noffences.  And this would establish a remarkable <p 72>difference\nbetween the variations of delinquency in England and in France.\n\nIf we analyse the record of infractions tried summarily in\nEngland, we find that contraventions of the law in respect of\ndrunkenness account for most of this increase (from 82,196 in 1861\nto 183,221 in 1885 and 165,139 in 1886).  On the other hand,\noffences against the person (assaults) and against property\n(stealing, larceny, malicious offences) have not shown so large an\nincrease.\n\nIn fact, if we compare the variations in assaults and thefts in\nFrance and England, we have the following figures:--\n\nENGLAND.\n                                        1861-3. 1879-81.\nPrisoners tried summarily for assaults  ... ... 100 102\n    Ditto for stealing, larceny, and malicious\n        offences    ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 100 110\n\nFRANCE.\nCases tried by the Tribunals:\nFor assault and wounding    ... ... ... ... ... 100 134\nFor simple theft    ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 100 116\n\n\n\nSo that in England not only the total delinquency, but more\nespecially the commoner offences against the person and against\nproperty show a slighter increase than that which has been\nestablished for the same period in France.  Whilst we do not\noverlook the greater increase of crimes against the person in\nEngland (coinciding, of course, with the doubling of the\npopulation in fifty-five years), this fact seems to me to prove\nthe salutary influence of English organisations against certain\nsocial factors which lead up to delinquency (such as the care of\n<p 73>foundlings, the guardianship of the poor, and so forth),\nnotwithstanding the great development of economic activity, which\nis assuredly in no way inferior to that of France.  The figures\nstrengthen my conclusions as to the social factors of crime, and\nrefute the optimistic theory of Poletti.\n\nBut the actual participation of each country in the general\nincrease of crime in Europe is determined by other causes, outside\nof the artificial influences of different codes of law.  And the\nmost general and constant of these causes, in all the various\nphysical and social environments, is the annual increase of\npopulation, which, by adding to the density of the inhabitants of\neach country, multiplies their material and legal relations to one\nanother, and, consequently, the objective and subjective\nconstituents of crime.\n\nTaking the official Italian figures, which are also relied on by\nM. Levasseur, we find, for the periods corresponding to the\nvariations of criminality, the following rates of increase in the\npopulation of the different countries.  Ireland shows a decrease,\nowing to emigration.\n\n                                            Increase.\nItaly   22,104,789 in 1863--30,947,306 in 1889  40 per cent.\n ''     27,165,553 in 1873--30,565,188 in 1888  12  ''\nFrance  31,858,937 in 1826--38,218,903 in 1887  20 per cent.\nBelgium  4,072,619 in 1840-- 5,583,278 in 1885  44  ''\nPrussia 21,046,984 in 1852--26,614,428 in 1878  26  ''\nGermany 45,717,000 in 1882--47,540,000 in 1887  4   ''\nEngland 13,896,797 in 1831--27,870,586 in 1886  101 ''\n ''     20,066,224 in 1861--27,870,586 in 1886  39  ''\nAustria 20,217,531 in 1869--23,070,688 in 1886  14  ''\nIreland  5,798,967 in 1861-- 4,777,545 in 1888 dec.  17 ''\n\n\nIt must, however, be observed, with regard to this increase of the\npopulation, firstly that it tells as a factor <p 74>of criminality\nonly in so far as it is not neutralised, wholly or in part, by\nother influences, mainly social, which prevent crime or render it\nless grave.  Secondly, it is not right merely to compare the\nproportional rates of increase in the population with those of\ncrime, as was done for instance by M. Bodio, who said that in\nItaly, from 1873 to 1883, ``since the population had increased by\n7.5 per cent., crime might have increased during the same time by\n7.5 per cent., without its being fair to say that it had actually\nincreased.''  In point of fact, as M. Rossi remarked, since in\nItaly, and almost all the European States, the growth of the\npopulation is due to the excess of births over deaths (for\nemigration is more numerous than immigration), it is evident that,\nwhen we confine our attention to short periods, the addition to\nthe population, consisting of children under ten or twelve years,\ndoes not increase crime in an appreciable degree.  The deaths, on\nthe other hand, must be subtracted from all stages of human life,\nbut especially from the number of those who can and do commit\ncrimes and offences.\n\nNow, as we cannot in this place go into detail, I must confine\nmyself to the statement of a few characteristic facts, as\nillustrated by European crime.  Thus we perceive the influence of\nthe great famine of 1846-7 on crimes against property in France\nand Belgium; the rapid oscillations of crime in Ireland,\nindicating the unstable political and social conditions of the\ncountry; and the parallel movements of crime in, France and\nPrussia.  We see, indeed, a constant diminution of crime for the\nperiod between 1860 and <p 75>1870, followed (after the\nstatistical disturbance of the terrible year 1870-1) by a period\nof serious and continued increase of crime, resulting from social\nand economic conditions, as shown especially by the increase of\nvagrancy and theft since 1875.\n\nAll these general facts go to prove the close and intimate\nconnection between crime and the aggregate of its various\nconstituents.  So that, without pursuing more detailed inquiries\ninto certain social factors of crime, which are capable of\nstatistical enumeration, such as the increase in the number of the\npolice, the abundance or scarcity of corn and wine, the spread of\ndrunkenness, family circumstances, increase of personal\npossessions, the facility or otherwise of the settlement of\ndisputes, commercial and industrial crises, the rate of wages, the\nvariation from year to year of the general conditions of\nexistence, and so forth, coincident with the development of\neducation, encouragements to thrift and the organisation of\ncharity, we must now proceed to draw from these statistical data\nthe most important conclusions of criminal sociology.\n\n\n<p 76>\nI.\n\n\nCriminal statistics show that crime increases in the aggregate,\nwith more or less notable oscillations from year to year, rising\nor falling in successive waves.  Thus it is evident that the level\nof criminality in any one year is determined by the different\nconditions of the physical and social environment, combined with\nthe hereditary tendencies and occasional impulses of the\nindividual, in obedience to a law which I have called, in analogy\nwith chemical phenomena, _the law of criminal saturation_.\n\nJust as in a given volume of water, at a given temperature, we\nfind a solution of a fixed quantity of any chemical substance, not\nan atom more or less, so in a given social environment, in certain\ndefined physical conditions of the individual, we find the\ncommission of a fixed number of crimes.\n\nOur ignorance of many physical and psychical laws and of\ninnumerable conditions of fact, will prevent us from obtaining a\nprecise view of this level of criminality.  But none the less is\nit the necessary and inevitable result of a given physical and\nsocial environment.  Statistics show us, indeed, that the\nvariations of this environment are always attended by\nconsequential and proportional variations of crime.  In France,\nfor instance (and the observation will be found to apply to every\ncountry which possesses an extended series of criminal\nstatistics), the number of crimes against the person varies but\nlittle in sixty-two years.  The same thing holds good for England\nand Belgium, because their special environment is also less\nvariable, <p 77>by reason that hereditary dispositions and human\npassions cannot vary profoundly or frequently, except under the\ninfluence of exceptional disturbances of the weather, or of social\nconditions.  In fact, the more serious variations in respect of\ncrimes against the person in France have taken place either during\npolitical revolutions, or in years of excessive heat, or of\nexceptional abundance of meat, grain, and wine.  This is\nillustrated by the exceptional increase of crime from 1849 to\n1852.  Minor offences against the person, on the contrary, which\nare more occasional, assaults and wounding, for example, vary in\nthe main, as to their annual oscillations, with the abundance of\nthe wine harvest, whilst in their oscillations from month to month\nthey display a characteristic increase during the vintage periods,\nfrom June to December, notwithstanding the constant diminution of\nother offences and crimes against the person.\n\nOn the other hand, crimes against property, and still more\noffences against property, show wide oscillations on account of\nthe variability of the special environment, which is almost always\nin a condition of unstable equilibrium, as in periods of scarcity,\nand of commercial, financial and industrial crises, and so forth,\nwhilst they are subject also to the influence of the physical\nenvironment.  Crimes and offences against property display\nextraordinary increases in the severest winter seasons, and\ndiminutions in milder winters.\n\nAnd this correspondence between the more general, powerful, and\nvariable physical and social factors of <p 78>crime, as well as\nits more characteristic manifestations such as thefts, wounding,\nand indecent assaults, is so constant and so direct that, when I\nwas studying the annual movement of criminality in France, and\nperceived some extraordinary oscillation in the crimes and\noffences, I foresaw that in the annals of the year I should find\nmention of an agricultural or political crisis, or an exceptional\nwinter or summer in the records of the weather.  So that with a\nsingle column of a table of criminal statistics I was able to\nreconstruct the historical condition of a country in its more\nsalient features.  In this way psychological experiment again\nconfirmed the truth of the law of criminal saturation.\n\nNot only so, but it may be added that as, in chemistry, over and\nabove the normal saturation we find that an increased temperature\nof the liquid envelopes an exceptional super-saturation, so in\ncriminal sociology, in addition to the ordinary saturation we are\nsometimes aware of an excess of criminal saturation, due to the\nexceptional conditions of the social environment.\n\nIndeed it is to be observed not only that the main and typical\ncriminality has a sort of reflex criminality depending upon it,\nbut also that an increase of more serious or more frequent crimes\ninduces a crop of resistance to and assaults upon the guardians of\npublic order, together with false witness, insults, avoidance of\nsupervision, absconding, and the like.  Certain crimes and\noffences also have their complementary offences, which from being\nconsequences become in their turn the causes of new offences.\nThus concealment and <p 79>purchase of stolen goods increase\nsimultaneously with theft; homicide and wounding lead to the\nillegal carrying of arms; adultery and abusive language to duels,\nand so forth.\n\nBeyond this there are sundry kinds of excessive criminal\nsaturations which are exceptional, and therefore transitory.\nIreland and Russia present us with conspicuous examples in their\npolitical and social crimes; and similarly America, during\nelection contests.  So in France before and after December 2 1851,\nthe harbouring of criminals, which in no other quadrennial period\nfrom 1826 to 1887 exceeds a record of fifty, rises in 1850-53 as\nhigh as 239.  So during the famine of 1847, theft of grain rises\nin France to forty-two in a single year, whilst for half a century\nit barely reaches a total of seventy-five.  It is notorious,\nagain, that in years of dear provisions, or severe winters, a\nlarge number of thefts and petty offences are committed for the\nsole object of securing maintenance within the prison walls.  And\nin this connection I have observed in France that other offences\nagainst property decrease during a famine, by an analogous\npsychological motive, thus presenting a sort of statistical\nparadox.  Thus, for example, I have found that as oidium and\nphylloxera are more effective than severe punishments in\ndiminishing the number of assaults and cases of unlawful wounding,\nso famine succeeds better than the strongest bars, or dogs kept\nloose in the prison yards, in preventing the escape of prisoners,\nwho at such times are detained by the advantage of being supported\nat the public expense.\n\nFor a parallel reason in 1847, a famine year, whilst <p 80>all\ncrimes and offences against property increased in an extraordinary\nfashion, only the crimes of theft and breach of confidence by\nhousehold servants showed a characteristic decrease, because such\npersons were deterred by the fear of being dismissed by their\nemployers during the time of distress.  The figures are as\nfollows:--\n\nFRANCE (Assizes).           1844.   1845.   1846.   1847.\nCrimes against property ... 3,767   3,396   3,581   4,235\nBreach of confidence by\n household servants ... ... 136     128     168     104\nThefts by the same  ... ... 1,001   874     924     896\n\n\nM. Chaussinand adds, by way of confirmation of my statement that\nduring economic crises, such as famine and high prices of grain,\nthe number of cases of escape from justice also decreases, _*for_\n``thieves and tramps prefer arrest, in order to escape from the\nmisery which afflicts them outside the prison walls.''\n\n\nTwo fundamental conclusions of criminal sociology may be drawn\nfrom this law of criminal saturation.\n\nThe first is that it is incorrect to assert a mechanical\nregularity of crime, which from Quetelet's time has been much\nexaggerated.  There has been a too literal insistance on his\nfamous declaration that ``the budget of crime is an annual\ntaxation paid with more preciseness than any other''; and that it\nis possible to calculate beforehand how many homicides, poisoners,\nand forgers we shall have, because ``crimes are generated every\nyear in the same number, with the same punishments, in the same\nproportions.''  And one constantly meets with this echo of the\nstatisticians, that ``from year to year crimes against the person\nvary at the <p 81>most by one in twenty-five, and those against\nproperty by one in fifty''; or, again, that there is ``a law of\nlimitation in crime, which does not vary by more than one in\nten.''\n\nThis opinion, originated by Quetelet and other statisticians after\nan inquiry confined to the more serious crimes, and to a very\nshort succession of years, has already been refuted, in part by\nMaury and Rhenisch, and more plainly by Aberdare, Mayr,\nMessedaglia and Minzloff.\n\nIn fact, if the level of criminality is of necessity determined by\nthe physical and social environment, how could it remain constant\nin spite of the continual variations, sometimes very considerable,\nof this same environment?  That which does remain fixed is the\nproportion between a given environment and the number of crimes:\nand this is precisely the law of criminal saturation.  But the\nstatistics of criminality will never be constant to one rule from\nyear to year.  There will be a dynamical but not a statical\nregularity.\n\nThus the element of fixity in criminal sociology consists in\nasserting, not the fatality or predestination of human actions,\nincluding crimes, but only their necessary dependence upon their\nnatural causes, and therewith the possibility of modifying effects\nby modifying the activity of these causes.  And, indeed, even\nQuetelet himself recognised this when he said, ``If we change the\nsocial order we shall see an immediate change in the facts which\nhave been so constantly reproduced.  Statisticians will then have\nto consider whether the changes have been useful or injurious.\nThese studies therefore show how <p 82>important is the mission of\nthe legislator, and how responsible he is in his own sphere for\nall the phenomena of the social order.''\n\nThe second consequence of the law of criminal saturation, one of\ngreat theoretical importance, is that the penalties hitherto\nregarded, save for a few platonic declarations, as the best\nremedies for crime, are less effectual than they are supposed to\nbe.  For crimes and offences increase and diminish by a\ncombination of other causes, which are far from being identical\nwith the punishments lightly written out by legislators and\nawarded by judges.\n\nHistory affords us various impressive examples.\n\nThe Roman Empire, when society had fallen into extreme corruption,\nrecalling many symptoms of our own epoch, vainly promulgated laws\nwhich visited celibacy, adultery, and incest--``venus\nprodigiosa''--with ``the vengeance of the sword and punishments of\nthe utmost severity.''  Dio Cassius (``Hist. Rom.,'' lxxvi. 16)\nsays that in the city of Rome alone, after the law of Septimus\nSeverus, there were three thousand charges of adultery.  But the\nstringent laws against these crimes continued to the days of\nJustinian, which shows that the crimes had not been checked; and,\nas Gibbon says (``Decline and Fall,'' ch. 44), the Scatinian law\nagainst ``venus nefanda'' had fallen into abeyance through lapse\nof time and the multitude of offenders.  Yet we see in our own\ndays, as in France, that there are some who would oppose celibacy\nwith no other remedy than a law passed for the purpose.\n\nSince medi<ae>val times the increasing gentleness of <p 83>manners\nhas caused a diminution of crimes of blood, once so numerous that\nthere was need of sundry ``truces'' and ``peaces,''\nnotwithstanding the harsh penalties of previous centuries.  And Du\nBoys called Cettes simple because, after giving a table of\nshocking punishments in the Germany of his day (the fifteenth\ncentury), he marvelled that all these pains and torments had not\nprevented the increase of crimes.\n\nImperial Rome deluded herself with the idea that she could stamp\nout Christianity with punishments and tortures, which, however,\nonly seemed to fan the flame.  In the same way Catholic Europe\nhoped to extinguish Protestantism by means of vindictive\npersecution, and only produced the opposite effect, as always\nhappens.  If the Reformed faith does not strike root in Italy,\nFrance, and Spain, that must be explained by psychological reasons\nproper to those nations, independently of the stake and of\nmassacres, for it did not strike root even when religious belief\nwas liberated from its fetters.  This does not prevent all\ngovernments in every land from continuing to believe that, in\norder to arrest the spread of certain political or social\ndoctrines, there is nothing better than to pass exceptional penal\nlaws, forgetting that, with ideas and prejudices just as with\nsteam, compression increases the expansive force.\n\nPopular education has swept away the so-called crimes of magic and\nwitchcraft, though they had withstood the most savage punishments\nof antiquity and medi<ae>val times.\n\nBlasphemy, in spite of the slitting of the nose, <p 84>tongue, and\nlips, enacted by the penal laws, and continued in France from\nLouis XI. to Louis XV., was very common in the middle ages, being\n(like witchcraft, trances, and self-immurement) a pathological or\nabnormal manifestation of religious emotion, which in those times\nhad an extraordinary development.  And the habit of blasphemy\ndiminished under the psychological and social evolution of our own\ndays, precisely when it ceased to be punished.  Or, rather, it\ncontinued to this day, as in Tuscany, where the Tuscan penal code\n(Art. 136), which survived until December 31, 1889, still punished\nit with five years' imprisonment.  The illusion as to the efficacy\nof punishment is so deeply rooted that a proposal was made in the\nSenate, in 1875, to include this penalty in the new Italian penal\ncode.  And at Murcia, in Spain, trials for blasphemy have lately\nbeen re-established.\n\nMittermaier observed that, if in England and Scotland there were\nfar fewer cases of false witness, perjury, and resistance to\nauthority than in Ireland and on the Continent, this must be due\nin great measure to national character, which is one of the\nhereditary elements of normal as well as of abnormal and criminal\nlife.\n\nThus even apart from statistics we can satisfy ourselves that\ncrimes and punishments belong to two different spheres; but when\nstatistics support the teaching of history, no doubt can remain as\nto the very slight (I had almost said the absence of any)\ndeterrent effect of punishments upon crime.\n\nWe may indeed derive a telling proof from statis<p 85>tical\nrecords, by referring to the progress of repression in France,\nover a period of sixty years, as I have already done in my\n``Studies'' previously quoted.\n\nWhen we speak of the repression of crime, we must first of all\ndistinguish between that which is due to the general character of\npenal legislation, more or less severe, and that which is secured\nby the administration by the judges of the law as it is.  Now, so\nfar as legislation is concerned, the growth of crime in France\ncertainly cannot be attributed to the relaxation of punishment.\nThe legislative reforms which have taken place, especially in 1832\nand 1863, on the general revision of the penal code, modified\npunishments to some extent, but with the definite purpose and\nresult, as shown by the same official records of criminal\nstatistics, of strengthening the repressive power of the law by\nproviding for the application of less aggravated punishments.  The\nrepugnance of juries and judges against excessive punishments, and\ntheir preference for acquittal, is, indeed, a psychological law.\nMoreover, it is well known that if there is in Europe a penal code\nless mild than any of the rest, it is that of France, which is the\noldest of those now in force, and still retains much of the\nmilitary rigour of its origin.  And it must be added that for\ncertain crimes, as for rapes and indecent assaults, which are\nnevertheless constantly increasing in France, the punishments have\nbeen increased by several successive enactments.  The same is true\nof extortion by threats of exposure, which occurs more and more\nfrequently, as M. Joly also observes, in spite of the severe\npunishments of the law of 1863.\n<p 86>\n\nThe question, therefore, is reduced to judicial repression, the\nprogress whereof must be observed in the past half-century, for it\nhas evidently the greatest influence upon crime.  Laws, in fact,\nhave no real operation if they are not applied more or less\nrigorously; for in the social strata which contribute most to\ncriminality the laws are known only by their practical\napplication, which is also the only truly defensive function,\ncarrying with it a special preventive of the repetition of the\ncrime by the person condemned.\n\nThus the arguments of jurists and legislators have not much value\nfor the criminal sociologist when they are based solely on the\npsychological illusion that the dangerous classes trouble\nthemselves about the shaping of a penal code, as the more\ninstructed and less numerous classes might well do.  The dangerous\nclasses attend to the sentences of the judges, and still more to\nthe execution of those sentences, than to the articles of a code.\nIn this connection I cannot agree with the forecast of Garofalo as\nto the perilous effect of the abolition of capital punishment in\nItaly on the imagination of the people; for he was well aware\nthat, though it is defined in various articles of the old code,\nand in about sixty sentences every year, the punishment of death\nhas not been carried out, which is the essential point, for the\nlast fifteen years.\n\nThe elements which determine the greater or less severity of\njudicial repression are of two kinds:--\n\n1.  The ratio of persons acquitted to the total number of\nprisoners put on their trial.\n\n2.  The ratio of the severest punishments to the total number of\nprisoners condemned.\n<p 87>\n\nCertainly the proportion of acquittals ought not to indicate a\ndifference in the severity of repression as such, for condemnation\nor acquittal ought to point merely to the certainty or otherwise\nof guilt, the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence.  But,\nas a matter of fact, the proportional increase of convictions does\npartly represent greater severity on the part of the judges, and\nstill more of the juries, who display it by attaching weight to\nsomewhat unconvincing evidence, or in too readily admitting\ncircumstances which tend to aggravate the offence.  This is\nconfirmed also by the rarity of acquittals in cases of contumacy.\n\nOf these two factors the former is certainly the more important,\nfor it is a psychological law that man, in regard to punishment as\nto any other kind of suffering, is more affected by the certainty\nthan by the gravity of the infliction.  And it is to the credit of\ncriminal theorists of the classical school that they have steadily\nmaintained that a mild yet certain punishment is more effectual\nthan one which, being severe in itself, holds out a stronger hope\nof escaping it.  Nevertheless it is a fact that they have carried\nthe theory too far, by seeking to obtain excessive mitigations and\nabbreviations of punishment, without exerting themselves to secure\ncertainty by reforms of procedure and police administration.\n\nThe diminution of the rate of acquittal is evident and continuous,\nboth at the Assizes and in the Tribunals, except for the last\nquadrennial period.  This may of course indicate a more careful\nmanagement of the trials by the judges; but it certainly shows\n<p 88>an undoubted tendency towards increased judicial severity,\nwhich, meanwhile, has not arrested the growth of crime.\n\nPERCENTAGE OF ACQUITTALS IN FRANCE.\n                Tried in\n                    Assize Courts.

The number\nhas, in fact, constantly diminished, especially in summary\nproceedings, which is just where the greatest increase of crime is\nmanifest.\n\nPassing now to the other factor of judicial repression, that is to\nthe percentage of persons sentenced to graver kinds of punishment,\nwe have to take into account, amongst assize cases in France, the\nprisoners <p 89>sentenced to death, penal servitude, and solitary\nimprisonment, excluding such as are sentenced to correctional\npunishment (simple imprisonment and fines) as well as young\nprisoners sent to reformatories; and in regard to the Tribunals,\nwe must take the percentages of those who are condemned to\nimprisonment, which is the most serious punishment, the remainder\nbeing fined, or handed over to their parents, or sent to\nreformatories.\n\n                 Condemned at Assizes               Condemned\n\nFRANCE.     ----------------------------      by Tribunals\n                 To death.

On the other hand, we\ncan see that, in the assize cases, excluding the first period,\nbefore the revision of 1832, whilst capital punishment shows a\ncertain diminution (especially due to the laws of 1832, 1848, &c.,\nwhich reduced the number of cases involving the death penalty),\nthough continuing at a certain level since 1861, sentences of\npenal servitude and solitary confinement show a con<p 90>tinued\nincrease from the second period, and especially since 1851.\n\nSo also at the Tribunals, except for a few oscillations, as in the\nninth period, there is a sustained increase of repression.\n\nAnd the fact that this increased ratio of the more serious\npunishments actually indicates a greater severity on the part of\nthe judges can only be contested on the ground of a simultaneous\nincrease of the more serious crimes and offences.  On the other\nhand, we note in France a general decrease of crimes against the\nperson (except for assaults on children), and still more of crimes\nagainst property.\n\nThere is also a striking confirmation in the corresponding\nacquittals and condemnations of a more serious character.  We see,\nin fact, that the more serious condemnations increase precisely\nwhen the acquittals decrease (as in the 4th, 6th, 7th, and 10th\nperiods at the Assizes, and the 2nd, 5th, and 8th periods at the\nTribunals); whilst in the years of more frequent acquittals there\nis also a diminution of more serious punishments, as in the 5th\nand 8th periods at the Assizes.  That is to say, the two sets of\nstatistics actually indicate a greater or less severity on the\npart of juries and judges.\n\nThis firmer repression is demonstrated in spite of the continued\nincrease of attenuating circumstances, which rose at the Assizes\nfrom 50 per cent. in 1833 to 73 per cent. in 1806, and at the\nTribunals from 54 per cent. in 1851 to 65 per cent. in 1886.\nNevertheless it is a fact that the number of cases tried by\ndefault at the Assizes has continuously decreased <p 91>from a\nyearly average of 647 in 1826-30 to one of 266 in 1882-6.\n\nFor Italy we have the following figures:\n\n     PRETORS.

This is the more necessary\nbecause my position as first stated has met with some criticism.\n\nIn the first place, it is easily seen, when we compare the total\nresult of crime with the varied character of its anthropological,\nphysical, and social factors, that punishment can exert but a\nslight influence upon it.  Punishment, in fact, by its special\neffect as a legal deterrent, acting as a psychological motive,\nwill clearly be unable to neutralise the constant and hereditary\naction of climate, customs, increase of population, agricultural\nproduction, economic and political crises, which statistics\ninvariably exhibit as the most potent factors of the growth or\ndiminution of criminality.\n\nIt is a natural law that forces cannot conflict or neutralise each\nother unless they are of the same kind.  The fall of a body cannot\nbe retarded, changed in direction or accelerated, save by a force\nhomogeneous with that of gravity.  So punishment, as a\npsychological motive, can only oppose the psychological factors of\ncrime, and indeed only the occasional and moderately energetic\nfactors; for it is <p 93>evident that it cannot, as a preliminary\nto its application, eliminate the organic hereditary factors which\nare revealed to us by criminal anthropology.\n\nPunishment, which has professed to be such a simple and powerful\nremedy against all the factors of crime, is therefore a panacea\nwhose potency is far beneath its reputation.\n\nWe must bear in mind a fact which is familiar enough, though it\nhas been too often forgotten by legislators and criminalists.\nSociety is not a homogeneous aggregate, but on the contrary an\norganism, like every animal organism, composed of tissues of\nvarying structure and sensibility.  Every society, in fact, with\nits progressive and increasingly distinctive needs and\noccupations, is a product of the union of social classes which\ndiffer greatly in their organic and psychical characteristics.\nThe physical constitution, the habits, sentiments, ideas, and\ntendencies of one social stratum are far from being the same as\nthose of other strata.  Here again we have, as Spencer would say,\nthe law of evolution through a departure from the homogeneous to\nthe heterogeneous, from the simple to the complex, or, in the\nwords of Ardigo, a natural formation by successive distinctions.\nAmongst savage tribes this distinction of the social strata does\nnot exist, or it is far less marked than in barbarian societies,\nand still less than in civilised societies.\n\nEvery schoolmaster with a bent for psychological observation\nseparates his pupils into three classes.  There is the class of\nindustrious pupils of good disposition, who work of their own\naccord, without <p 94>calling for strict discipline; that of the\nignorant and idle (degenerate and of weak nervous force) from whom\nneither mildness nor severity can obtain anything worth having;\nand that of the pupils who are neither wholly industrious nor\nwholly idle, and for whom a discipline based on psychological laws\nmay be genuinely useful.\n\nThis is the case with large bodies of soldiers or of prisoners,\nfor all associations of men, and for society as a whole.  These\npartial organisms, due to the constant relationships of a life\nmore or less in common, are in this respect reproductions of\nsociety as a whole, just as a fragment of crystal reproduces the\ncharacteristics of the unbroken crystal.[13]\n\n\n\n[13] There is, however, some difference between the manifestation\nof the activity of a group of men and that of the aggregate\nsociety.  Between psychology which studies the individual, and\nsociology which studies the society, I think there is room for a\n_collective psychology_, to study more or less defined groups.\nThe phenomena of these groups are analogous, but not identical\nwith those of the sociological body properly so called, according\nas the union is more or less definite.  Collective psychology has\nits field of observation in all unions, however occasional, such\nas the public street, the markets, workshops, theatres meetings,\nassemblies, colleges, schools, barracks, prisons, and so forth.\nMany practical applications of the data of collective psychology\nmight be given.  An example will be found in a future chapter,\nwhen I come to consider the psychology of the jury.\n\n\n\nIn the same way, from the standpoint of criminal sociology, we may\ndivide the social strata into three analogous categories--the\nhighest, which commits no crimes, organically upright, restrained\nonly by the authority of the moral sense, of religious sentiments\nand public opinion, together with the hereditary transmission of\nmoral habits.  This class, for which no penal code would be\nnecessary, is unfortunately very small; and it is far smaller if,\nin <p 95>addition to legal and apparent criminality, we also take\ninto account that social and latent criminality through which many\nmen, who are upright so far as the penal code is concerned, are\nnot upright by the standard of morality.\n\nAnother class, the lowest, is made up of individuals opposed to\nall sense of uprightness, who, being without education,\nperpetually dragged back by their material and moral destitution\ninto the primitive forms of the brute struggle for existence,\ninherit from their parents and transmit to their children an\nabnormal organisation, adding degeneration and disease, an\natavistic return to savage humanity.  This is the nursery of the\nborn criminals, for whom punishments, so far as they are legal\ndeterrents, are useless, because they encounter no moral sense\nwhich could distinguish punishment by law from the risk which also\nattends upon every honest industry.\n\nLastly we have the other class of individuals who are not born to\ncrime, but are not firmly upright, alternating between vice and\nvirtue, with imperfect moral sense, education and training, for\nwhom punishment may be genuinely useful as a psychological motive.\nIt is just this class which yields the large contingent of\noccasional criminals, for whom punishments are efficacious if they\nare directed in their execution by the axioms of scientific\npsychology, and especially if they are aided by the social\nprevention which reduces the number of opportunities of committing\ncrimes and offences.\n\nOnce again I must express my agreement with M. Garofalo, who, in\ndealing with this subject, <p 96>insists on the necessity of\ndistinguishing between the different classes of criminals before\ndeciding as to the efficacy of punishments.\n\nYet this conclusion as to the very limited efficiency of\npunishments, which is forced upon us by facts, and which, as\nBentham said, is confirmed by the application of each punitive\nact, precisely because its previous application did not succeed in\npreventing crime, is directly opposed to general public opinion,\nand even to the opinion of jurists and legislators.\n\nOn the inception or the growth of a criminal manifestation,\nlegislators, jurists, and public think only of the remedies, which\nare as easy as they are illusory, of the penal code, or of some\nnew Act of repression.  Even if this were useful, which is very\nproblematical, it has the inevitable disadvantage of making men\nignore other remedies, far more profitable, albeit more difficult,\nof a preventive and social kind.  And this tendency is so common\nthat many of those who have dwelt upon or accepted the positive\nmovement of the new school, not long after they had admitted that\nI was in the right, declared impulsively that ``the constant\ncommission of crime arises from the lack of timely repression,''\nand that ``one of the chief causes of the growth of crime in Italy\nis the mildness of our punishments.''  Or else they forgot to ask\nthemselves the elementary question of criminal sociology, whether\nand how far punishments have a genuinely defensive force.  This is\njust what happens with pedagogues who enter upon long discussions\non the various methods and means of <p 97>education, without\nasking themselves beforehand whether and how far education has the\nactual power of modifying the temperament and character which\nheredity stamps upon every individual.\n\nThese conclusions take us far beyond the limit of penal severity,\nand at the same time they suffice to combat the objection commonly\nraised against those who think, like ourselves, that repressive\njustice ought to concern itself not with the punishment of past\ncrime, but with the prevention of future crime.  For whilst the\nadvocates of severity, and those whom I will call the\n``laxativists,'' virtually think (apart from a few platonic\nstatements) only of punishments as remedies of offences, we on the\nother hand believe that punishments are merely secondary\ninstruments of social self-defence, and remedies ought to be\nadapted to the actual factors of the offence.  And since the\nsocial factors are most capable of modification, so we say with\nPrins that ``for social evils we require social cures.''\n\nM. Tarde, then, was not quite accurate in his remark that my\nconviction as to the very slight efficacy of punishments is a mere\nconsequence of my ideas on the anthropological and physical\ncharacter of crime, and that, ``on the contrary, the\npreponderating importance which he has assigned to the social\ncauses logically debars him from accepting this conclusion.''  As\na matter of fact, punishment regarded as a psychological motive so\nfar as it is a legal deterrent, and as a physical motive so far as\nit implies the confinement of the person condemned, would more\nnaturally belong, in abstract <p 98>logic, to the biological and\nphysical theory of crime.  Whereas it is precisely because I\nrecognise the influence of social environment, in addition, that\nexperimental logic convinces me that punishment is not an\nefficacious remedy of crime, unless forces are applied beforehand\nto neutralise, or at any rate to counteract, the social factors of\ncrime.\n\nAnd if this is not a new conclusion, as one of our critics\nobserves by way of reproach--as though it were not one of the\ncharacteristics of truth to repeat itself persistently, however\nmuch it may be forgotten or even opposed--we must nevertheless\nremark that it is now repeated with a mass of new observations and\ndefinite applications, which give it a force unknown to mere\nlogical deductions.\n\nThe classical school has concerned itself simply with mitigation\nof punishment as compared with medi<ae>val excess; and for this\nreason, because every age has its own mission, it could not also\nconcern itself with the prevention of crimes, which is far more\nuseful and efficacious.  A few isolated thinkers, it is true,\nwrote a few bold and far-reaching pages on preventive methods in\nopposition to the numerous volumes on punishment; but their words\nhad no effect upon criminalists and legislators, because science\nhad not yet undertaken the positive and methodical observation of\nthe natural factors of crime.\n\nI will confine myself to a few examples, in order to show that\namongst practical men, as amongst public officials and\nlegislators, the illusion that punishments are the true panacea of\ncrime is always predominant.\n<p 99>\n\nPractical men declare that ``the prohibitive penal law ought to be\nregarded as the first and most important of preventive laws.''\nThe pr<e'>fets in their circulars, being concerned about the\nincrease of crime, put forward the most vigilant and severe\nrepression as a sovereign remedy.  A counsellor of the French Cour\nde Cassation writes that ``in a worthy system of social police\nthere is no better guarantee for order and safety than\nintimidation.''  The Keeper of the Seals, in his report on French\npenal statistics for 1876, speaking of the continued increase of\nindecent assaults, comes to the conclusion that ``in any case,\nonly firm and energetic repression can avail against a lamentable\nincrease of crimes against morality.''  And more recently another\nKeeper of the Seals ended his report on the statistics of 1826 to\n1880 by observing that ``the growth of crime can only be opposed\nby an incessantly vigorous repression.''  M. Tarde agreed with\nthis conclusion, saying that ``if crimes are only, as has been\nsaid, railway accidents of a society travelling at full speed, it\nmust not be forgotten that, the faster the train, the stronger\nmust be the brake . . . and it is certain that such a state of\naffairs demands an increase or a new departure of repression and\npunishment.''\n\nIt may be admitted that our conclusion is not a novelty; but, as\nStuart Mill said, there are two ways of effecting useful\ninnovations, to discover what was not known before, or else to\nrepeat with new demonstrations the truths which had been\nforgotten.\n\nAnd this illusion as to the influence of punishments <p 100>is so\nwidespread that it is well to inquire into its historic and\npsychological arguments; for, as Spencer says, in order to decide\nas to the value of an idea, it is useful to examine its genealogy.\n\nWe may pass by the foundation of primitive vengeance, which from\nthe age of private combats passed into the spirit and form of the\nearliest penal laws, and still subsists as a more or less\nunconscious and enfeebled residuum in modern society.  We may also\npass by the hereditary effect of the traditions of medi<ae>val\nseverity, which excite an instinctive sympathy for stern\npunishment in connection with every crime.\n\nBut one of the main reasons of this tendency is an error of\npsychological perspective, whereby men have forgotten the profound\ndifferences of the ideas, habits, and sentiments of the various\nsocial strata, concerning which I have spoken above.  Through this\nforgetfulness the honest and instructed classes confound their own\nidea of the penal law, and the impression it makes upon them, with\nthe idea and the impression of the social classes from which the\nmajority of criminals are recruited.  This has been remarked upon\nby Beccaria, Carmignani, and Holtzendorff amongst the classical\ncriminalists, and by Lombroso and others of the new school who\nhave studied the slang and literature of criminals, which are\ntheir psychological mirror.  Again, it is forgotten that for the\nhigher classes, apart from their physical and moral repugnance\nagainst crime, which is the most powerful repelling force, there\nis the fear of public opinion, almost unknown amongst the classes\nwhich <p 101>have stopped short at a lower stage of human\nevolution.\n\nFor the higher classes one example may suffice.  It is the fact\nobserved upon by Mr. Spencer, that gambling debts and Stock\nExchange bargains are scrupulously discharged, though for them\nthere is neither penal obligation nor evidence in writing.  And it\nmay be added that imprisonment for debt never promoted the\nfulfilment of contracts, nor has its abolition discouraged it.\n\nAs for the lower classes, one visit to a prison suffices.  There,\nif you ask a prisoner why the punishment did not deter him from\nthe crime, you generally get no answer, because he has never\nthought about it.  Or else he replies, as I have often found, that\n``if you were afraid of hurting yourself when you went to work,\nyou would give up working.''  These indeed are what one would\nexpect to be the feelings prevailing amongst the lower social\nstrata, to whom honest sentiments and ideas, which for us are\ntraditional and organic, come very late--just as Mr. Stanley\nobserved that the people in Central Africa are only now beginning\nto employ stone guns, which in past ages were used in Europe.\n\nAnother fallacy which helps to strengthen confidence in\npunishments is that the effect of exceptional and summary laws is\ntreated on the same basis as that of the ordinary codes, slow and\nuncertain in their procedure, which saps all their force by the\nchance of immunity, and the interval between the unlawful act and\nits legal consequence.\n\nLombroso and Tarde, indeed, have confronted me <p 102>with\nhistoric examples of vigorous and even savage repressions, whereby\nit was possible to stamp out some epidemic crime.  But these\nexamples are not conclusive, for I have shown that, as soon as\nthese exceptional repressions were at an end, as, for instance,\nafter the death of Pope Sixtus V., brigandage and other crimes\nwere persistently renewed.  But my main rejoinder is this, that\nthese exceptional repressions depend upon the _jus belli_; and\ntherefore cannot enter into the ordinary and constant methods of\npenal administration.  This may not have the effect of an\nextraordinary repression, secured by a somewhat unscrupulous\npromptitude, which strikes innocent and guilty alike; and thus it\nis impossible to treat as equal, or even to compare, the influence\nof methods which are essentially different.\n\nAnother false comparison is drawn between the effective force of\nvarious punishments, and their potentiality is confounded, whereas\nit is necessary to distinguish the punishment of the written code\nfrom that of the judge, and still more from that carried into\nexecution.  In fact it is only natural that punishment should more\nor less terrify the criminal who has been judged and is about to\nbe condemned; but this in no way proves its efficacy, which should\nhave been displayed by the menace of the law in guarding the\nprisoner against the crime.  Even with the death penalty, there\nare many instances of condemned persons who, through congenital\ninsensibility, submit to it cynically.  Moreover, for such as have\nbeen overwhelmed with terror when the moment of execution arrived,\nthe utmost that this fact can prove is that <p 103>they are so\nconstituted as to give themselves up completely to the impression\nof the moment, without the energy to resist it.  In other words,\nso long as the punishment is distant and uncertain, they were not\nterrified, but having always yielded to the impression of the\nmoment, they yielded to the criminal impulse.\n\nFor other punishments, also, it is known that punitive methods,\neven when not contrary to the law, as they sometimes are in Italy,\nare always less stern than simple folk imagine when they read the\ncodes and the sentences.  And criminals naturally judge of\npunishments by their own experience, that is to say, in accordance\nwith their practical application, and not with the more or less\ncandid threats of the lawmaker.\n\nIf we add to vindictive feeling, historic traditions, oblivion of\nbio-psychic differences of the social strata, the confounding of\nexceptional laws and ordinary punishments, and of the varying\neffective force of punishment, the attitude of the public mind and\nthe natural tendency of criminalists to think only of their two\nsyllogistic symbols of crime and punishment--if we further add the\neasy-going idea of the multitude, that the inscribing of a law in\nthe statute-book is a sufficient remedy for social diseases, we\ncan readily understand how this exaggerated and illusory\nconfidence in punishment is so persistent, and crops up in every\ntheoretical or practical discussion, in spite of the strong\nrefutation which is daily afforded by facts and psychological\nobservation.\n\nAll human actions, like the actions of animals, are developed\nbetween the two opposite poles of <p 104>pleasure and pain, by the\nattraction of the former and the repulsion of the latter.  And\npunishment, which is one of the social forms of pain, is always a\ndirect motive in human conduct, as it is also an indirect guide,\nby virtue of its being a sanction of justice, unconsciously\nstrengthening respect for the law.  But still this psychological\ntruth, whilst it demonstrates the natural character of punishment,\nand the consequent absurdity of abolishing it as absolutely void\nof efficacy, does not destroy our conclusion as to the slight\nefficacy of punishment as a counteraction of crime.\n\nWe have only to distinguish between punishment as a natural\nsanction and punishment as a social sanction in order to see how\nthe really great power of natural punishment almost entirely\ndisappears in social punishment, which in all our systems is but a\nsorry caricature.\n\nThe mute but inexorable reaction of nature against every action\nwhich infringes her laws, and the grievous consequences which\ninevitably follow for the man who has infringed them, constitute a\nrepression of the most efficacious kind, wherein every man,\nespecially in the earlier years of his life, receives daily and\nnever to be forgotten lessons.  This is the discipline of natural\nconsequence, which is a genuine educational method, long since\npointed out by Rousseau, and developed by Spencer and Bain.\n\nBut in this natural and spontaneous form, the punishment derives\nits whole force from the inevitable character of the consequences.\nAnd it is one of the few observations of practical psychology\nwhich have <p 105>been made and repeated by the classical students\nof crime, that in punishment, and especially the punishment of\ndeath, the certainty is more effectual than the severity.  And I\nwill add that even a small uncertainty takes away from a pain\nwhich we fear, much of its repelling force, whereas even a great\nuncertainty does not destroy the attraction of a pleasure which we\nare hoping for.\n\nHere, then, we have a primary and potent cause of the slight\nefficacy of legal punishments, in the picturing of the many\nchances of escape.  First there is the chance of not being\ndetected, which is the most powerful spring of all contemplated\ncrime: then the chance, in case of detection, that the evidence\nwill not be strong enough, that the judges will be merciful, or\nwill be deceived, that judgment may be averted amidst the\nintricacies of the trial, that clemency may either reverse or\nmitigate the sentence.  These are so many psychological causes\nwhich, conflicting with the natural fear of unpleasant\nconsequences, weaken the repellent force of legal punishment,\nwhilst they are unknown to natural punishment.\n\nThere is also another psychological condition which, undermining\neven the force of natural punishment, almost entirely destroys the\npower of social punishment; and that is improvidence.  We see, in\nfact, that even the most certain natural consequences are defied,\nand lose most of their power to guard an improvident man from\nanti-natural and dangerous actions.  Now in regard to legal\npunishment, even apart from passionate impulse, it is known that\ncriminals, occasional and other, are specially improvident, in\ncommon <p 106>with savages and children.  This weakness is\nconspicuous enough in the lower and less instructed classes, but\namongst criminals it is a genuine characteristic of psychological\ninfirmity.\n\nNow, whilst a very slight force is sufficient to produce very\ngreat and constant effects, when it acts in harmony with natural\ntendency and environment, every process, on the other hand, which\nis opposed to the natural tendencies of man, or which does not\nfollow them closely, encounters a resistance which triumphs in the\nlast resort.\n\nEveryday life gives us many examples.  The university student,\nwhen he gambles, risks on a single card the last remnant of his\nallowance, and prepares for himself a thousand privations.  Miners\nand workmen at dangerous trades refuse to take warning by the\nsight of comrades whom they have seen dying or repeatedly attacked\nby disease.  M. Despine related that, during the cholera of 1866,\nat Bilbao, there were some who set up an imitation of the disease\nin order to obtain charitable relief, though in several cases\ndeath ensued.  M. Fayet, in an essay on the statistics of accused\npersons in France, extending over twenty years, remarked that\nspecific and proportionately greater criminality was displayed by\nnotaries and bailiffs, who knew better than any one else the\npunishments fixed by law.  And in the statistics of capital\npunishment at Ferrara, during nine centuries, I discovered the\nsignificant fact that there is a succession of notaries executed\nfor forgery, frequently at very short intervals, in the same town.\nThis attests the truth of the observation made by Montesquieu and\nBeccaria, <p 107>as against the deterrent power of the death\npenalty, for men grow accustomed to the sight; and this again is\nconfirmed by the fact mentioned by Mr. Roberts, a gaol chaplain,\nand M. B<e'>renger, a magistrate, that several condemned men had\npreviously been present at executions, and by another fact\nmentioned by Despine and Angelucci, that in the same town, and\noften in the same place, in which executions had been carried out,\nmurders are often committed on the same day.\n\nA man does not change his identity; and no penal code, whether\nmild or severe, can change his natural and invincible tendencies,\nsuch as inclination to pleasure and persistent hope of impunity.\n\nLet us also observe that, as Mill said, the permanent efficacy of\nany measure in the spheres of politics, economy, and\nadministration, is always inversely proportional to its force and\nsuddenness.  Now punishment does not stand the test even of this\nsociological law, for in its essence it is only the primitive\nreaction of force against force.  It is true that, as Beccaria\nsaid, the classical school has always aimed at rendering social\nreaction against crime less violent; but that is not enough.\nHenceforward, if we are to adapt ourselves to psychological and\nsociological laws, the development of our defensive administration\nmust tend to render this social reaction less direct.  If the\nstruggle for existence is always to remain the supreme law of\nliving creatures, yet it is not necessary that it should always be\ndeveloped in the violent forms of primitive humanity.  On the\ncontrary, one of the results of social progress is to make the\nstruggle for existence less violent and less direct.\n<p 108>\n\nIn the same way, the continuous struggle between society and\ncriminals, instead of being a physical and social force, directly\nopposed to a physical individual force, should rather become an\nindirect system of psychical forces.  Penal law in society has the\nsame qualities as education in the family and pedagogy in schools.\nAll the three were once dominated by the idea of taming human\npassions by force; the rod was supreme.  In course of time it was\nperceived that this produced unexpected results, such as violence\nand hypocrisy, and then men thought fit to modify their\npunishments.  But in our own days schoolmasters see the advantage\nof relying solely on the free play of tendencies and bio-\npsychological laws.  Similarly the defensive function of society,\nas Romagnosi said, in place of being a physical and repressive\nsystem, ought to be a moral and preventive system, based on the\nnatural laws of biology, psychology, and sociology.\n\nForce is always a bad remedy for force.  In the Middle Ages, when\npunishments were brutal, crimes were equally savage; and society,\nin demoralising rivalry with the atrocity of criminals, laboured\nin a vicious circle.  Now, in the lower social grades, the brutal\nman, who often resorts to violence, is in his turn frequently the\nvictim of violence; so that, amongst criminals, a scar is somewhat\nof a professional distinction.\n\n\nTo sum up, our doctrine as to the efficacy of punishments does not\nconsist, as some critics too sparing of their arguments have\nmaintained, in an absolute negation, but rather and especially in\nobjecting to the <p 109>traditional prejudice that punishments are\nthe best and most effectual remedies of crime.\n\nWhat we say is this.  Punishment by itself, as a means of\nrepression, possesses a negative rather than a positive value; not\nonly because it has not the same influence on all anthropological\ntypes of criminals, but also because its use is rather to preclude\nthe serious mischief which would result from impunity than to\nconvert, as some imagine that it can, an anti-social into a social\nbeing.  But impunity would lead to a demoralisation of the popular\nconscience in regard to crimes and offences, to an increase of the\nprofound lack of foresight in criminals, and to the removal of the\npresent impediment to fresh crimes during the term of\nincarceration.\n\nIt is the same with education, the modifying power of which is\ncommonly exaggerated.  Education, though it has an enduring\ninfluence on children, and is therefore more effectual than\npunishment, is far more serviceable in eliminating anti-social\ntendencies, whereof we all possess the germs, than in any supposed\ncreation of social tendencies and forces which were not present\nfrom birth.\n\nThus, whilst the consequences of impunity and lack of education\nare serious and mischievous, still this does not prove conversely\nthat punishment and education have in reality so positive an\ninfluence as is commonly attributed to them.\n\nIt is precisely on the ground of this negative, yet real efficacy\nof punishments, especially whilst they are being carried out,\nthat, whilst we appreciate the mitigation of punitive discipline\nwhich has been <p 110>achieved by the classical school, we\nbelieve, on the other hand, that their abbreviation of the term of\npunishments is altogether mistaken and dangerous.  We admit that\npunishment ought not to be an arbitrary and inhuman torture, and\nfor this reason we have no sympathy with the system of solitary\nconfinement, now so much in fashion with the classical jurists and\nprison authorities, precisely because it is inhuman, as well as\nunwise and needlessly expensive.\n\nIt is a psychological absurdity and a social danger, which\nnevertheless underlies the new Italian penal code, that punishment\nought to consist more and more in a short isolation of the\nprisoner.  For, setting aside the well-known results of short\npunishments, such as corruption and recidivism, it is evident that\nin this way punishment is deprived of its main element of negative\nefficiency against crime, as well as of its effect in preventing\ncrime during the incarceration of the criminal.\n\n\nII.\n\n\nSince punishments, instead of being the simple panacea of crime\nwhich popular opinion, encouraged by the opinions of classical\nwriters on crime and of legislators, imagine them, are very\nlimited in their deterrent influence, it is natural that the\ncriminal sociologist should look for other means of social defence\nin the actual study of crimes and of their natural origin.\n\nWe are taught by the everyday experience of the <p 111>family, the\nschool, associations of men and women, and the history of social\nlife, that in order to lessen the danger of outbreaks of passion\nit is more useful to take them in their origin, and in flank, than\nto meet them when they have gathered force.\n\nBentham relates that in England the delays caused by hard-drinking\ncouriers, who used to be heavily fined without any good result,\nwere obviated by combining passenger traffic with the postal\nservice.  Employers of labour secure industry and the most\nproductive work far more easily by offering a share of the\nrealised profits than by a system of fines.  In the German\nuniversities, academic jealousies and intolerance have been in\ngreat measure overcome by paying the professors in proportion to\nthe number of their pupils, so that the Faculties find it to their\ninterest to engage and encourage the best professors, in order to\nattract as many students as possible.  Thus the activity and zeal\nof professors, magistrates, and officials would be stimulated if\ntheir remuneration depended not only on the automatic test of\nseniority, but also on the progress displayed by publications,\nsentences not reversed, settlements not cancelled, and the like.\nIt is better to regulate the disturbing restlessness of children\nby timely diversions rather than by attempting to repress them in\na manner injurious to their physical and moral health.  So in\nlunatic asylums and prisons, work is a better means of order and\ndiscipline than chains and castigation.  In brief, we obtain more\nfrom men by consulting their self-respect and interests than by\nthreats and restraint <p 112>\n\nIf the counteraction of punishment must inevitably be opposed to\ncriminal activity, still it is more conducive to social order to\nprevent or diminish this activity by means of an indirect and more\neffective force.\n\nIn the economic sphere, it has been observed that when a staple\nproduct fails, recourse is had to less esteemed substitutes, in\norder to supply the natural wants of mankind.  So in the criminal\nsphere, as we are convinced by experience that punishments are\nalmost devoid of deterrent effect, we must have recourse to the\nbest available substitutes for the purpose of social defence.\n\nThese methods of indirect defence I have called _penal\nsubstitutes_.  But whereas the food substitutes are as a rule only\nsecondary products, brought into temporary use, penal substitutes\nshould become the main instruments of the function of social\ndefence, for which punishments will come to be secondary means,\nalbeit permanent.  For in this connection we must not forget the\nlaw of criminal saturation, which in every social environment\nmakes a minimum of crime inevitable, on account of the natural\nfactors inseparable from individual and social imperfection.\nPunishments in one form or another will always be, for this\nminimum, the ultimate though not very profitable remedy against\noutbreaks of criminal activity.\n\nThese penal substitutes, when they have once been established in\nthe conscience and methods of legislators, through the teaching of\ncriminal sociology, will be the recognised form of treatment for\nthe social factors of crime.  And they will also be <p 113>more\npossible and practical than that universal social metamorphosis,\ndirect and uncompromising, insisted on by generous but impatient\nreformers, who scorn these substitutes as palliatives because\nhumanitarian enthusiasm causes them to forget that social\norganisms, like animal organisms, can be only partially and\ngradually transformed.\n\nThe idea of these penal substitutes amounts, in short, to this.\nThe legislator, observing the origins, conditions, and effects of\nindividual and collective activity, comes to recognise their\npsychological and sociological laws, whereby he will be able to\nobtain a mastery over many of the factors of crime, and especially\nover the social factors, and thus secure an indirect but more\ncertain influence over the development of crime.  That is to say,\nin all legislative, political, economic, administrative, and penal\narrangements, from the greatest institutions to the smallest\ndetails, the social organism will be so adjusted that human\nactivity, instead of being continually and unprofitably menaced\nwith repression, will be insensibly directed into non-criminal\nchannels, leaving free scope for energy and the satisfaction of\nindividual needs, under conditions least exposed to violent\ndisturbance or occasions of law-breaking.\n\nIt is just this fundamental idea of penal substitutes which shows\nhow necessary it is that the sociologist and legislator should\nhave such a preparation in biology and psychology as Mr. Spencer\njustly insisted on in his ``Introduction to Social Science.''  And\nit is the fundamental idea rather than the substitutes themselves\nthat we should bear in mind if we <p 114>would realise their\ntheoretical and practical value as part of a system of criminal\nsociology.\n\nAs for the efficacy of any particular penal substitute, I readily\nadmit, in some sense at least, the partial criticisms which have\nbeen passed upon them.  Apart from such as simply say that they do\nnot believe in the use of alternatives to punishment, and such as\nconfine themselves to the futile question whether this theory\nbelongs to criminal science or to police administration, a\nmajority of criminal sociologists have now definitely accepted the\ndoctrine of penal substitutes.  This theory is accepted, not as an\nabsolute panacea of crime, but, as I have always stated it, in the\nsense of a combination of measures analogous to penal repression;\nin place of trusting solely to repression for the defence of\nsociety against crime.\n\nLet us take note of a few examples.\n\nI.  _In the Economic Sphere_.--Free Trade (apart from the\ntemporary necessity of protecting a particular manufacturing or\nagricultural industry), by preventing famines and exceptional high\nprices of and taxes on food, eliminates many crimes and offences,\nespecially against property.--Unrestricted emigration is a safety-\nvalve, especially for a country in which this phenomenon, assuming\nlarge proportions, carries off many persons who are easily driven\nto crime by wretchedness, or by their unbalanced energy.  Thus the\nnumber of recidivists has diminished in Ireland, not by virtue of\nher prison systems, but by emigration, which reached forty-six per\ncent. of released prisoners.  In Italy, also, there has been a\ndecrease <p 115>of crime since 1880, owing to other causes, such\nas mild winters and plentiful harvests, but also through a vast\nincrease of emigration.--Smuggling, which for centuries resisted\nextremely harsh punishments, such as amputation of the hand, and\neven death, and which still resists prison and the fire-arms of\nthe revenue officers, is suppressed by the lowering of the import\ntariff, as M. Villerm<e'> has shown in the case of France.  So\nthat everyday facts justify the system of Adam Smith, who said\nthat the law which punished smuggling, after creating the\ntemptation, and which increased the punishment when it increased\nthe temptation, was opposed to all justice; whilst Bentham, on the\ncontrary, departing from his maxim that the punishment ought to be\ndreaded more strongly than the offence attracted, called for the\nstern repression of smuggling.--The system of taxation which\ntouches wealth and visible resources instead of the prime\nnecessaries of life, and which is proportional to the taxpayer's\nincome, diminishes the systematic frauds which no punishment\navailed to stop, and it will also abolish the arbitrary and\nexaggerated fiscal traditions which have been the cause of\nrebellions and outrages.  In fact, Fr<e'>gier describes the\ncriminal industries which are called into existence by _octrois_,\nand which will disappear with the abolition of these absurd and\nunjust duties.  And whilst M. Allard demonstrated that a decrease\nof taxes on necessaries would have beneficial effects, not only in\neconomic affairs but also in respect of commercial frauds, the\nReport on French Criminal Statistics for 1872 calmly continued to\ncall for more severe repression of such frauds.  To <p 116>this M.\nMercier replied that if the cause--that is to say,\ndisproportionate taxes--were not removed, it would be impossible\nto prevent the effects.--Immunity from taxation for the minimum\nnecessary to existence, by preventing distraint, and the\nconsequent diminution of small properties, which means the\nincrease of the very poor, will obviate many crimes, as we see\nfrom the agrarian conditions in Ireland.  Thus there is a demand\nin Italy for the inalienability of small properties, as in America\nunder the Homestead Exemption Law.--Public works, during famine\nand hard winters, check the increase of crimes against property,\nthe person, and public order.  For instance, during the scarcity\nof 1853-5 in France, there was no such enormous increase of theft\nas during the famine of 1847, simply because the Government set up\nvast relief works in the winter months.\n\nThe taxes and other indirect restrictions on the production and\nsale of alcohol are far more efficacious than our more or less\nenormous gaols.  The question of pronounced and chronic\ndrunkenness has increased in gravity, owing to its effect upon the\nphysical and moral health of the people.\n\nIn France the average consumption of wine, estimated at 62 litres\n(13.64 gallons) per head in 1829, exceeded 100 litres in 1869; and\nin Paris the average of 120 litres in 1819-30, reached 227 litres\nin 1881.  The average yearly consumption of alcohol in France rose\nfrom .93 in 1829 to 3.24 in 1872, and 3.9 in 1885, the rates in a\nfew towns being still higher.  The total manufacture of alcohol in\nFrance (95 per cent. of <p 117>which is consumed in the form of\ndrink) rose from 479,680 hectolitres in 1843 to 1,309,565 in 1879,\nand 2,004,000 in 1887.  Simultaneously, we have seen that there\nwas an increase of crimes and offences in France, suicides in\nparticular having increased from 1,542 in 1829 to 8,202 in 1887.\n\nMoreover I have shown by a special table (_Archivio di\nPsichiatria_) that in France, despite a certain inevitable\nvariation from year to year, there is a manifest correspondence of\nincrease and decrease between the number of homicides, assaults,\nand malicious wounding, and the more or less abundant vintage,\nespecially in the years of extraordinary variations, whether of\nfailure of the vintage (1853-5, 1859, 1867, 1873, 1878-80),\nattended by a remarkable diminution of crime (assaults and\nwounding), or of abundant vintages (1850, 1856-8, 1862-3, 1865,\n1868, 1874-5) attended by an increase of crime.\n\nI was also the first to show that in the vintage months there is\nan increase of occasional crimes and offences against the person,\nowing to that connection between drink and crime which had already\nbeen remarked upon by M. Pierquin amongst others, and illustrated\nby the newspaper reporters on the days which follow Sundays and\nholidays.\n\nBut apart from their natural variation, the connection between\ndrink and crime is definitely established.  Every day we have the\nconfirmation of Morel's statement, that ``alcoholism has produced\na demoralised and brutalised class of wretched beings,\ncharacterised by an early depravation of instincts, and by\nindulgence in the most immoral and dangerous actions.''  It is\n<p 118>useless to quote again in this place the data of psycho-\npathology and legal medicine, or those of prison statistics\nrelating to imprisoned drunkards, or to tavern brawls as the\nproved causes of crime.\n\nNevertheless it is a fact that the relation of cause and effect\nbetween drink and crime has recently been denied, with the aid of\narguments based upon statistics.  M. Tammeo opened the discussion\nby observing that the countries of Europe and the provinces of\nItaly distinguished by the largest consumption of alcohol, show\nlower ratios under the worst crimes of violence.  He gave to his\nremark a relative and limited value, for he only denied that the\nabuse of liquor was the most active cause of crime.  After him M.\nFournier de Flaix, maintaining the same proposition with the same\nstatistical arguments, and admitting that ``alcohol is a special\nscourge for the individual who indulges in it,'' yet concluded\nthat ``alcoholism is not a scourge which menaces the European\nrace.''  And he repeated that the nations which consumed the\ngreatest quantity of alcohol show a slighter frequency of crime,\nespecially against the person.  Lastly M. Colajanni enlarged upon\nthe same proposition, using the statistical data so fully set out\nby M. Kummer, and drew a still more positive conclusion, that\n``there is a lack of constancy, regularity, and universality in\nthe relations, coincidence, and sequence, as between alcoholism\nand crime and suicide; so that it is impossible to establish any\nstatistical relation of cause and effect between these\nphenomena.''\n\nPassing over the grave errors of fact in M. Colajanni's brochure,\nI will only observe that this pro<p 119>position is a pure\nmisapprehension of statistical logic.\n\nIf we once admit (and unfortunately it cannot be denied) the bad\ninfluence of alcohol on bodily and mental health, in the form of\nspirits as well as of wine--as to which it is not correct to say\nthat the southern departments are not consumers of alcohol--it\ncannot be maintained that alcohol, which is physically and morally\ninjurious to individuals, is not hurtful to nations, which are but\naggregates of individuals.\n\nThere is an easy answer to the statistical arguments.  (1) A\nsymmetrical and continuous agreement of figures is never found in\nany collection of statistics, for in all that concerns a society\nthe intervention of individual, physical, and social causes is\ninevitable.  (2) A negative conclusion from these partial and\nnatural disagreements (for it is especially true in biology and\nsociology that every rule has its exceptions, due to intervening\ncauses) would only be justified if it had been maintained that\nalcoholism is the sole and exclusive cause of crime.  But as this\nhas never been asserted by anybody, all the statistical arguments\nof Fournier and Colajanni are based on a misapprehension.  And\nunfortunately they do not destroy the link of causality between\ndrink and crime.  This connection is occasional, in assaults,\nwounding, and homicide in acute alcoholism.  It is habitual, in\nthe case of chronic alcoholism, as in crimes against property, the\nperson, morality, and public officers.  And this in spite of the\nrelatively low figures, though lower than the facts warrant,\ncon<p 120>tained in the general statements, apart from special and\nscientific inquiries into alcoholism as a direct and manifest\ncause of crime and suicide.\n\nI wrote as early as 1881 that alcoholism, prior to its becoming a\ncause, is the effect of wretched social conditions in the poorer\nclasses; and that to the one-sided simplicity of economic causes\nit is necessary to add certain bio-psychical conditions and\nconditions of physical environment, which go far to determine the\ngeographical distribution of spirit-alcoholism (chronic and more\nserious, in northern countries and provinces) and wine-alcoholism\n(acute and less deep-seated, in the countries and provinces of the\nsouth).\n\nIt was therefore natural that indirect measures against alcoholism\nshould have been resorted to long ago, such as the raising of the\ntax on alcoholic drinks, and the lowering of that on wholesome\nbeverages, such as coffee, tea, and beer; strict limitation of the\nnumber of licenses; increased responsibility of license-holders\nbefore the law, as in America; the expulsion of tipsy members from\nworkmen's societies; the provision of cheap and wholesome\namusements; the testing of wines and spirits for adulteration;\nbetter organised and combined temperance societies; the\ncirculation of tracts on the injurious effects of alcohol; the\nabolition of certain festivals which tended rather to\ndemoralisation than to health; discouragement of the custom of\npaying wages on Saturday; the establishment of voluntary\ntemperance homes, as in America, England, and Switzerland.\n\nNorth America, England, Sweden and Norway, <p 121>France, Belgium,\nHolland, and Switzerland have applied remedies against drunkenness\n(to the length of a State monopoly of drink in Switzerland); but\nwith too much zeal for public revenue, and, under the pretext of\npublic health, almost exclusively framed with a view to duties on\nmanufacture, distribution, and consumption.  Yet these duties are\nquite inadequate by themselves, and may even tend to the injury of\nthe physical and moral health of the nation, the increase of\nprice, leading to frauds and adulteration.\n\nPenal laws against drunkenness, naturally resorted to in all\ncountries, are far from being effectual.  There is so far no\nsystem of direct and indirect measures against alcoholism, duly\nco-ordinated, beyond taxation and punishment.  And we perceive, as\nfor instance in France, in spite of the repressive law introduced\nby my distinguished friend Senator Roussel (January, 1873), and in\nspite of the extremely high duties, which were doubled in 1872 and\n1880, that alcoholism persists with a terrible and fatal increase.\nSo it is, more or less, in every country still, in spite of duties\nand punishments.\n\nThe irregularity of wages, and the deceitful vigour imparted by\nthe first recourse to alcohol, the poverty and excessive toil of\nthe working classes, insufficiency of food, inherited habits, and\nthe lack of efficacious preventive measures, are influences which\nprevent the working man from resisting this scourge; and no fiscal\nor repressive law, acting solely by direct compulsion, will ever\nbe able to paralyse these natural tendencies, which can only be\nweakened by indirect <p 122>measures.  On the other hand, when we\nremember that habitual intoxication, so common in medi<ae>val days\namongst the nobles and townsfolk, has grown less and less frequent\nin those classes (aided by the introduction and rapid diffusion of\ncoffee since the time of Louis XIV.), it is possible to hope that\nthe improvement of economic, intellectual, and moral conditions\namongst the populace will gradually succeed in modifying this\nterrible plague of drink, which cannot be cured all at once.\n\nTo continue our illustrations of penal substitutes, we see that\nthe substitution of metallic money for a paper medium decreases\nthe number of forgers, who on the contrary had defied penal\nservitude for life.  False money is more easily detected than a\nspurious note.[14]--Money dealers and dealers in precious stones\nhave done more than any punishment to check the crime of usury, as\nwas shown in the case of Spain, after her American conquests;\nwhereas medi<ae>val punishments never prevented the recrudescence\nof usury in one form or another.  Popular and Agricultural Credit\nBanks, which are practically within the reach of all, are more\nefficacious against usury in our own days than the special\nrepressive laws enacted once more in Germany and Austria, under\nthe influence of the old illusion.--With the diminution of\ninterest on the public funds the stream of capital has been\ndiverted into commerce, manufactures, and agriculture, thus\nwarding off stagnation, with the <p 123>bankruptcies, forgeries,\nfrauds, &c., which result therefrom.--The adjustment of salaries\nto the needs of public officials, and to general economic\nconditions, stems the tide of corruption and embezzlement, which\nwere partly due to their concealed poverty.--Limited hours of duty\nfor the responsible services on which the safety of the public\ndepends, as for instance in railway stations, are far more\nserviceable in preventing accidents than the useless punishment of\nthose who are guilty of manslaughter.--High-roads, railways, and\ntramways disperse predatory bands in rural districts, just as wide\nstreets and large and airy dwellings, with public lighting and the\ndestruction of slums, prevent robbery with violence, concealment\nof stolen goods, and indecent assaults.--Inspection of workshops\nand shorter hours for children's labour, with their\nsuperintendence of married women, may be a check on indecent\nassaults, which penal servitude does not prevent.--Cheap workmen's\ndwellings, and general sanitary measures for houses both in urban\nand rural districts, care being taken not to crowd them with poor\nfamilies, tend to physical health, as well as to prevent many\nforms of immorality.--Co-operative and mutual societies, provident\nsocieties and insurance against old age, funds for sick and infirm\nworkmen, employers' liability for accidents during work, from\nmachinery or otherwise; popular savings' banks, charity\norganisation societies and the like, obviate a large number of\noffences against property and the person much better than a penal\ncode.--I have maintained in the Italian Parliament that the reform\nof religious <p 124>charities, which in Italy represent funds to\nthe amount of two milliards, might lead to the prevention of\ncrime.--Measures for the discouragement of mendicity and vagrancy,\nabove all agricultural colonies, as in Holland, Belgium, Germany,\nand Austria, would be the best penal substitute for the very\nfrequent offences committed by vagabonds.  Thus it may be\nconcluded that a prudent social legislation, not stopping short at\nmere superficial and perfunctory reforms, might constitute a\ngenuine code of penal substitutes, which could be set against the\nmass of criminal impulses engendered by the wretched conditions of\nthe most numerous classes of society.\n\n\n[14] Coiners and forgers of notes constitute .09 per cent. of the\ntotal of condemned persons in France, and .04 per cent. in\nBelgium; but they reach .4 per cent. in Italy, on account of the\ngreater circulation of banknotes.\n\n\n\nII.  _In the Political Sphere_.--For the prevention of political\ncrime, such as assassination, rebellion, conspiracies, civil war,\narbitrary repression and prevention by the police are powerless;\nthere is no other means than harmony between the Government and\nthe national aspirations.  Italy has been a conspicuous example of\nthis, for under the rule of the foreigner, neither the scaffold\nnor the galleys could hinder political outrages, which have\ndisappeared with national independence.  So with Ireland and\nRussia.  Germany, which believed that it could stamp out socialism\nby exceptional penal laws, discovered its mistake.--For so-called\npress offences (which are either ordinary offences committed by\nthe aid of the press, or are not offences at all), nothing but\nfreedom of opinion can render attacks and provocations of a\npolitical type less frequent.--Respect for the law spreads through\na nation by the example on the part of the governing classes and\nauthorities of constant <p 125>respect for the rights of\nindividuals and associations, far better than by policemen and\nprisons.--Electoral reform adapted to the condition of a country\nis the only remedy against electoral offences.--Similarly, in\naddition to the economic reforms already indicated, political and\nparliamentary reforms are much more serviceable than the penal\ncode in preventing many offences of a social and political type,\nprovided that a more real harmony has been established between a\ncountry and its lawful representation, and that the latter is\nfreed from the occasions and the forms which lead to its abuse, by\nremoving technical questions from injurious political influences,\nand giving the people a more direct authority over public affairs,\nincluding the _referendum_.--Finally, that great mass of crimes,\nisolated or epidemic, evolved by unsatisfied needs and the neglect\nof separate divisions of a country, which differ in climate, race,\ntraditions, language, customs, and interests, would be largely\neliminated if we were to dispense with the vague folly of\npolitical symmetry and bureaucratic centralisation, and in their\nplace to adapt the laws to the special features of the respective\nlocalities.  National unity in no way depends upon legislative and\nadministrative uniformity, which is merely its unhealthy\nexaggeration.  It is indeed inevitable that laws, which in our day\nmerely represent a mode of contact between the most varied moral,\nsocial and economic conditions of different localities, should\nalways be inadequate to social needs--too restricted and slow in\naction for one part of the country, too sweeping and premature for\nanother part, just as the <p 126>average convict's garb is too\nlong for those who are short, and too short for those who are\ntall.  Administrative federation with political unity (_e pluribus\nunum_) would furnish us with an aggregate of penal substitutes,\nrestoring to each part of the social organism that freedom of\nmovement and development which is a universal law of biology and\nsociology--for an organism is but a federation too lightly\nappreciated by the advocates of an artificial uniformity, such as\nends by conflicting with unity itself.\n\nIII.  _In the Scientific Sphere_.--The development of science,\nwhich creates fresh instruments of crime, such as fire-arms, the\npress, photography, lithography, new poisons, dynamite,\nelectricity, hypnotism, and so forth, sooner or later provides the\nantidote also, which is more efficacious than penal repression.--\nThe press, anthropometric photography of prisoners, telegraphy,\nrailways, are powerful auxiliaries against crime.--Dissection and\nthe progress of toxicology have decreased the number of poisoning\ncases; and experience has already proved that ``Marsh's\npreparation'' has rendered poisoning by arsenic, once so common,\ncomparatively rare.--A similar process has recently been suggested\nas a means of detection in cases of forgery, for when documents\nare exposed to iodine vapour, effaced or altered writing is\nrestored.--Women doctors will diminish the opportunities of\nimmorality.--The free expression of opinion will do more to\nprevent its possible dangers than trials of a more or less\nscandalous kind.--Piracy, which <p 127>was not extirpated by\npunishments which are now obsolete, is disappearing under the\neffects of steam navigation.--The spread of Malthusian ideas\nprevents abortion and infanticides.[15]--Systematic bookkeeping,\nby its clearness and simplicity, obviates many frauds and\nembezzlements, which were encouraged by the old complicated\nmethods.--Cheques, by avoiding the necessity of frequent\nconveyance of money, do more to prevent theft than punishments can\ndo.--The credentials given by some banks to their clerks, whose\nduty it is to witness the signature of the actual debtor, prevent\nthe falsification of bills.--Certain bankers have adopted the\npractice of taking an instantaneous photograph of every one\npresenting cheques for large amounts.--Safes, bolts, and alarm-\nbells, are a great security against thieves.  <p 128>--As a\npreventive of murder in railway carriages, it has been found that\nalarm signals and methods of securing the carriage-doors from the\ninside, are more effectual than penal codes.\n\n\n[15] No doubt there may be a difference of opinion on this subject\nin France, where public opinion is too much exercised over the\nproblem of depopulation.  I agree with M. Varigny (``La Th<e'>orie\ndu Nombre,'' _Revue des Deux Mondes_, Dec. 15, 1890) that the\npopulation of a country is not the sole, or even the principal\nconsideration.  Apart from physical characteristics (race),\nintellectual and moral qualities, and the productiveness of the\nsoil on which M. Varigny dwells, we must take into account, as it\nseems to me, the unquestionable law by virtue of which the\nstruggle for existence, amongst individuals as amongst nations,\nbecomes gradually less vehement and direct.  War, which is an\neveryday matter with savages, grows constantly more rare and\ndifficult.  The varying social and international conscience of\ncivilised humanity is not to be neglected, and it must be reckoned\nwith as a positive factor in considering the destiny of nations.\nMen continue to speak of the perils of war (in which numbers stand\nfor a great deal, but are not the exclusive element) as though the\nsocial conscience of our own day were still the same as that of\nthe Middle Ages.  In several respects, on the other hand, the\nthinner population of France is one cause of its wealth, and\ntherefore of its power.  Germany has a more numerous, but also a\npoorer population.  And I do not believe that the actual power of\nnations, on which their future depends, consists in loading a\npeople with arms after enfeebling it by military expenditure,\nwhich from the year 1880 has indicated a distinct epidemic mania\non the continent of Europe.\n\nIV.  _In the Legislative and Administrative Sphere_.--Wise\ntestamentary legislation prevents murders through the impatient\ngreed of next-of-kin, as in France during a former age, with what\nwas known as ``succession powder.''--A law to facilitate the\nsecuring of paternal assent for the marriage of children (as\nsuggested by Herschel in his ``Theory of Probabilities'') in\ncountries which require the assent of both parents, and for\naffiliation and breach of promise of marriage, with provision for\nchildren born out of wedlock, are excellent as against\nconcubinage, infanticide, abortion, exposure of infants, indecent\nassaults, and murders by women abandoned after seduction.  On this\nhead Bentham said that concubinage regulated by civil laws would\nbe less mischievous than that which the law does not recognise but\ncannot prevent.--Cheap and easy law is a preventive of crimes and\noffences against public order, the person and property, as I have\nalready said.--The ancient Italian institution of Advocate of the\nPoor, if substituted for the present illusory assistance by the\ncourts, would prevent many acts of revenge.  So also would a\nstrict and speedy indemnity for the victims of other men's crimes,\nintrusted to a public minister when the injured person is not able\nto resort to the law; for as I have maintained, with the approval\nof sundry criminal sociologists, civil responsibility for crime\nought to be <p 129>as much a social obligation as penal\nresponsibility, and not a mere private concern.--Simplification of\nthe law would prevent a large number of frauds, contraventions,\n&c., for, apart from the metaphysical and ironical assertion that\nignorance of the law excuses no man, it is certain that our forest\nof codes, laws, decrees, regulations and so forth, leads to\nendless misapprehensions and mistakes, and therefore to\ncontraventions and offences.--Commercial laws on the civil\nresponsibility of directors, on bankruptcy proceedings and the\nregistration of shareholders, on bankrupts' discharges, on\nindustrial and other exchanges, would do more than penal servitude\nto prevent fraudulent bankruptcy.--Courts of honour, recognised\nand regulated by law, would obviate duels without having recourse\nto more or less serious punishments.--A well organised system of\nconveyancing checks forgery and fraud, just as registration\noffices have almost abolished the palming and repudiation of\nchildren, which were so common in medi<ae>val times.  Deputy\nMichelin, in order to discourage bigamy, proposed in 1886 to\ninstitute in the registers of births for every commune a special\ncolumn for the civil standing of each individual, so that any one\nwho contemplated marriage would have to produce a certificate from\nthis register, and thus would be unable to conceal a previous\nmarriage which had not been dissolved by death or divorce.--The\nform of indictment by word of mouth in penal procedure has\nprevented many calumnies and false charges.--Foundling and orphan\nhomes, or, still better, some less old-fashioned substitute, such\nas <p 130>lying-in hospitals and home attendance for young\nmothers, might do much to prevent infanticide and abortion, which\nare not checked by the severest punishment.--Prisoners' aid\nsocieties, especially for the young, might be useful as penal\nsubstitutes, although much less so than is generally alleged, with\nplenty of eloquence and little practical work.  There is always\nthis strong objection to them, that we ought to succour workmen\nwho continue honest in spite of their wretchedness before those\nwho have been in prison; and again, in place of bestowing\npatronage on released prisoners without distinction, many of whom\nare incorrigible, we ought to select the occasional criminals and\ncriminals of passion, who alone are capable of amendment; and\nassisting them we should avoid anything like police formalities.\nAs a matter of fact it appears that, even in England, where these\nsocieties are most active, their intervention, like all direct\ncharity, is too far below the needs of those for whom provision is\nnecessary.\n\nV.  _In the Sphere of Education_.--It has been proved that mere\nbook education, whilst it is useful in rendering certain gross\nfrauds more difficult, in extending a knowledge of the laws, and\nabove all in diminishing improvidence, so characteristic of the\noccasional criminal, is far from being the panacea of crime which\npeople imagined when they found in the criminal statistics a large\nproportion of illiterate prisoners.  It must also be said that\nschools which are not closely inspected are frequently hotbeds of\nimmorality.  It is necessary, therefore, to rely on the influence\nof a wider education, limited <p 131>though this may be in its\nturn.  I do not mean a mechanical instruction in moral maxims,\nappealing to the intelligence without reaching the feelings, but\nrather of the examples afforded by every kind of social\ninstitution, by the government and the press, by the school of the\nstage and of public entertainments.--It would be well, however, to\nabolish certain vulgar and sensual entertainments, and to\nsubstitute for them wholesome amusements and exercises, public\nbaths, properly superintended, and so built as to render private\nmeetings impossible, cheap theatres, and so forth.  Thus the\nprohibition of cruel spectacles, and the suppression of gambling\nhouses, are excellent penal substitutes.--The experimental method\nin the teaching of children, which applies the laws of physio-\npsychology, according to the physical and moral type of each\npupil, and by giving him less of archaology, and more knowledge\nserviceable in actual life, by the mental discipline of the\nnatural sciences, which alone can develop in him a sense of the\nactual, such as our classical schools only enfeeble, would adapt\nmen better for the struggle of existence, whilst diminishing the\nnumber of those left without occupation, who are the candidates of\ncrime.--Many of the causes of crime would be nipped in the bud by\nchecking degeneration through physical education of the young, as\nwell as by preventing demoralisation by means of the education of\nabandoned children, at such institutions as the workhouse, ragged\nand industrial schools, so well developed in England--or, still\nbetter, by the boarding out of children, so as to avoid over-\ncrowding.--One class of inducements to crime <p 132>would be\neliminated by restrictions imposed on scandalous publications\nwhich concern themselves exclusively with crime, having no other\nobject than to trade upon the most brutal passions, and which are\nallowed to exist under an abstract conception of liberty, save\nthat the responsible conductors are punished when the evil has\nbeen done.--Similarly there ought to be some restriction upon the\nright of admission to police-courts and assizes, where our women\nhustle each other as the Roman women of the decline scrambled to\nbe present at the imperial circus-shows, and where our young men\nand our hardened criminals receive lessons in the art of\ncommitting crimes with greater smartness and precaution.\n\n\nThe instances which I have given, and which might be multiplied\ninto a preventive code as long as the penal code, prove to\ndemonstration how large a part is played by social factors in the\ngenesis of crime, and especially of occasional crime.  But they\nprove still more clearly that the legislator, by modifying these\ncauses, can influence the development of crime within limits\nimposed by the competition of other anthropological and physical\nfactors.  Quetelet was right, therefore, when he said in this\nconnection, ``Since the crimes committed every year seem to be the\nnecessity of our social organisation, and their number cannot be\ndiminished if the causes to which they are due cannot be modified\nin a preventive sense, it behoves legislators to recognise these\ncauses, and to eliminate them as far as possible.  They must frame\n<p 133>the budget of crime as they frame that of the national\nrevenue and expenditure.''\n\nIt must nevertheless be borne in mind that all this will have to\nbe done apart from the penal code; for it is true, however\nstrange, that history, statistics, and direct observation of\ncriminal phenomena prove that penal laws are the least effectual\nin preventing crime, whilst the strongest influence is exercised\nby laws of the economic, political, and administrative order.\n\nIn conclusion, the legislator should be convinced by the teaching\nof scientific observation that social reforms are much more\nserviceable than the penal code in preventing an inundation of\ncrime.  The legislator, on whom it devolves to preserve the health\nof the social organism, ought to imitate the physician, who\npreserves the health of the individual by the aid of experimental\nscience, resorts as little as possible, and only in extreme cases,\nto the more forcible methods of surgery, has a limited confidence\nin the problematic efficiency of medicines, and relies rather on\nthe trustworthy processes of hygienic science.  Only then will he\nbe able to avoid the dangerous fallacy, ever popular and full of\nlife, which Signor Vacca, Keeper of the Seals, expressed in these\nwords:  ``The less we have recourse to preventive measures, the\nmore severe ought our repression to be.''  Which is like saying\nthat when a convalescent has no soup to pick up his strength, we\nought to administer a drastic drug.\n\nIt is precisely on this point that the practical, rather than the\nmerely theoretical, differences between the positive and the\nclassical schools of penal law become evident.  Whilst we believe\nthat social reforms <p 134>and other measures suggested by a study\nof the natural factors of crime are most effective in preventing\ncrime, legislators, employing the _a{sic} priori_ method of the\nclassical school, have for many years past been discussing\nproposed penal codes, whilst they permit criminality to make\nsteady progress.  It is another case of _Dum Rom<ae> consulitur,\nSaguntum expugnatur_.\n\nAnd when the legislators find their Byzantine discussions on the\n``juridical entities'' of crime and punishment broken in upon by a\nrecrudescence of crime, or by a serious manifestation of some\nphenomenon of social pathology, then all they can do in their\nperplexity and astonishment is to pass some new repressive law,\nwhich for a moment stills the outcry of public opinion, and remits\nthe matter once more from the acute to the chronic phase.\n\nThe positive theory of penal substitutes, apart from any\nparticular example, aims precisely at furnishing a mental\ndiscipline for legislators, and bringing home to them the duty of\nconstant reinforcements of social prevention, no matter how\ndifficult it may be, before the evil comes to a head, and forces\nthem too late to a course of repression which is as easy as it is\nfallacious.  No doubt it is vexatious and difficult, even in\nprivate life, to be perpetually living up to rules of health; and\nit is easier, if more dangerous, to forget them, and to fly, when\nthe mischief declares itself, to drugs which are too frequently\ndeceptive; but it is just the want of forethought, both public and\nprivate, which it is so important to overcome.  And as hygienic\nscience was not possible as a theory or as a practice until after\n<p 135>the experimental observations and physio-pathology on the\ncauses of disease, especially of epidemic and infectious diseases,\ntogether with the discoveries of M. Pasteur, who created\nbacteriology; so social hygiene as against crime was only possible\nas a theory, and will not be so as a practice, till the diffusion\nof the facts of biology and criminal sociology relating to the\nnatural causes of crime, especially of occasional crime.\n\nThe great thing is to be convinced that, for social defence\nagainst crime, as for the moral elevation of the masses of men,\nthe least measure of progress with reforms which prevent crime is\na hundred times more useful and profitable than the publication of\nan entire penal code.\n\nWhen a minister introduces a law, for instance, on railways,\ncustoms duties, wages, taxation, companies, civil or commercial\ninstitutions, there are few who think of the effect which these\nlaws will have on the criminality of the nation, for it is\nimagined that sufficient has been done in this respect by means of\nreforms in the penal code.  In the social organism, on the other\nhand, as in individuals, there is an inevitable solidarity, though\nfrequently concealed, between the most distant and different\nparts.\n\nIt is just from these laws of social physiology and pathology that\nwe derive the notion of penal substitutes, which at the same time\nwe must not dissociate from the law of criminal saturation.  For\nif it is true that by modifying the social factors we can produce\nan effect on the development of crime, and especially of\noccasional crime, it is also true, unfortunately, that in every\nsocial environment there is always a minimum <p 136>of inevitable\ncriminality, due to the influence of the other factors, biological\nand physical.  Otherwise we might easily fall into the opposite\nand equally fallacious illusion of thinking that we could\nabsolutely suppress all crimes and offences.  For it is easy to\nreach on one side the empiric idea of penal terrorism, and on the\nother side the hasty and one-sided conclusion that to abolish some\nparticular institution would get rid of its abuses.  The fact is\nthat we must consider before all things whether it is not a less\nevil to put up with institutions, however inconvenient, and to\nreform them, than to forfeit all the advantages which they afford.\nAnd it must above all be borne in mind that as society cannot\nexist without law, so law cannot exist without offences against\nthe law.  The struggle for existence may be fought by honest or\neconomic activity, or by dishonest and criminal activity.  The\nwhole problem is to reduce to a minimum the more or less criminal\nrufflings and shocks, yet without disturbing ``social order,''\namidst the indifference or servility of a spiritless people, or\nresorting to policemen and prisons on every slight occasion.\n\nThese general observations on penal substitutes in connection with\nthe law of criminal saturation are a sufficient answer to the two\nchief objections raised even by such as agree with me in theory.\n\nIt has been urged, in effect, that some of the penal substitutes\nwhich I have enumerated have already been applied, without\npreventing crime; and again, that there were some institutions\nwhich it would be absurd to abolish because the removal of a\nprohibition would also remove the contravention.\n<p 137>\n\nThe aim of penal substitutes is not to render all crimes and\noffences impossible, but only to reduce them to the least possible\nnumber in any particular physical and social environment.  There\nare crimes of piracy to this day, but the use of steam in\nnavigation has, none the less, been more effectual than all the\npenal codes.  Murders still occur, though very rarely, on the\nrailways; but it is none the less true that the substitution of\nthe railways and tramways for the old diligences and stage coaches\nhas decimated highway robberies, with or without murder.  Divorce\ndoes not eliminate wife-murder as a consequence of adultery, but\nit diminishes its frequency.  Similarly, after the protection\nwhich is afforded to abandoned children, we shall not be able to\nclose the tribunals through the absence of crimes and offences,\nbut it is certain that the supply of these will be notably\ndiminished.\n\nAs for the second objection, I was careful to say, in regard to\nexisting institutions, that we must naturally consider whether the\nevil arising from violating them or that which would be due to\ntheir suppression is the greater.  But my main contention is that\nby reforming these institutions we can do more to prevent crime\nthan by leaving them as they happen to be, or at most granting\nthem the fallacious protection of one or two articles in the penal\ncode.\n\nI will myself add a criticism of the theory of penal substitutes,\nand it is that they are difficult of application.  We have only to\nthink of the immense force of inertia in the habits, traditions\nand interests which have to be overcome before we can secure the\nappli<p 138>cation, not of all, but of any one of the penal\nsubstitutes which I have enumerated.  And some of these are not\nsimple, or based on a single principle, but comprise an assemblage\nof co-ordinated reforms, like the prevention of drunkenness, the\nprotection of abandoned children, the accessibility of justice,\nand so forth.\n\nBut if legislators must take into account the actual conditions of\nthe people, and adapt themselves to conditions of time and place,\nit is the business of science to indicate the goal, however\ndistant and difficult to reach.  The first condition of attaining\nlegislative and social reforms is that they should impress\nthemselves beforehand on the public conscience; and this is not\npossible if science, in spite of transitory difficulties, does not\nresolutely open up the road which has to be travelled, without any\ncompromise with eclecticism, which means for science what\nhybridism means for organic life.\n\n\nTwo other objections may be made on the ground of principle to\nwhat has been said.  The first is that this system of penal\nsubstitutes is only the familiar process of prevention of crime.\nThe second is that the criminal expert need not concern himself\nwith it, since prevention is only a question of good government,\nwhich has nothing to do with the study of crimes and punishments.\n\nMy answer to the second objection is that the importance of taking\nmeasures to prevent crime has certainly been dwelt upon,\nespecially from the time of Montesquieu and Beccaria, but it has\nbeen only by <p 139>way of platonic and isolated declaration, with\nno such systematic development as might have given them practical\napplication, based on experimental observations.  Moreover, this\nprevention has always been held as subsidiary to repression,\nwhereas we have arrived at the positive conclusion that\nprevention, instead of being a mere secondary aid, should\nhenceforth become the primary defensive function of society, since\nrepression has but an infinitesimal influence upon criminality.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to observe the profound distinction\nbetween ordinary prevention and penal substitutes; or in other\nwords, between prevention by police and prevention by society.\nThe former merely seeks to prevent crime when its germ is already\ndeveloped and active, and it nearly always employs methods of\ndirect coercion, which, being themselves repressive in their\ncharacter, are often inefficacious, even if they do not provoke\nadditional offences.  Social prevention, on the other hand, begins\nwith the original sources of crime, attacking its biological,\nphysical, and social factors, by methods which are wholly\nindirect, and which rest upon the free play of psychological and\nsociological laws.\n\nScience, as well as the making of laws, has hitherto been too much\ninfluenced by a preference for repression, or at least for\nadministrative police prevention.  ``There have been authoritative\nworks and learned folios,'' says Ellero, ``which dealt not only\nwith punishment, but also with torture; there has been none\ndealing with the provision of means for providing an alternative\nto punishment.''\n<p 140>\n\nAfter the general observations of Montesquieu, Filangieri,\nBeccaria, and more recently Tissot, on the influence of religion,\nclimate, soil, and the form of government, upon the penal system\nrather than the prevention of crime, the authors who studied\nprevention with wider and more systematic views (excluding the\ncriminal sociologists who have more or less taken the positive\npoint of view), are Bentham, Romagnosi, Barbacovi, Carmignani,\nEllero, Lombroso, and a few Englishmen, who, without making much\nof the theory, have made many practical suggestions of preventive\nreform.  But even these writers either confine themselves to\ngeneral synthetic considerations, like Romagnosi and Carmignani,\nor else, entering the domain of facts, and even accepting the idea\nof social prevention, have made too little of those physio-\npsychological laws as the natural factors of crime, which alone\ncan furnish a method of regulating human activity.  And, when all\nis said and done, they have clung to punishment as the chief\nmethod of prevention.\n\nHence their teaching and their propositions have had no weight\nwith legislators, for these latter had not been convinced, as only\nthe criminal sociologist could convince them, that punishments are\nfar from having the deterrent force commonly attributed to them,\nand that crime is not the outcome of free will, but rather a\nnatural phenomenon which can only disappear or diminish when its\nnatural factors are eliminated.\n\nThe legislators for their part have not only neglected the\ndefinite teaching of these authors with more than ordinary\ninsight, but they have also enacted what are <p 141>really penal\nsubstitutes in a clumsy and unscientific manner.\n\nWe have thus studied the data of criminal statistics in their\ntheoretical and practical relations with criminal sociology, and\ncome to the conclusion that, since crime is a natural phenomenon,\ndetermined by factors of three kinds, it answers on that account\nto a law of criminal saturation, whereby the physical and social\nenvironment, aided by individual tendencies, hereditary or\nacquired, and by occasional impulses, necessarily determine the\nextent of crime in every age and country, both in quantity and\nquality.  That is to say, the criminality of a nation is\ninfluenced in the natural sphere by the bio-psychical conditions\nof individuals and their physical environment, and, in the social\nsphere, by economic, political, administrative and civil\nconditions of laws, far more than by the penal code.\n\nNevertheless the execution of punishment, though it is the less\nimportant part of the function of social defence, which should be\ncarried out in harmony with the other functions of society, is\nalways the last and inevitable auxiliary.\n\nAnd this entirely agrees with the universal law of evolution, in\nvirtue of which, amidst the variation of animal and social\norganisms, antecedent forms are not wholly eliminated, but\ncontinue as the basis of the forms which succeed them.  So that if\nthe future evolution of the social administration of defence\nagainst crime is to consist in the development of the primitive\nforms of direct physical coercion into the higher forms of\nindirect psychical discipline of human activity, this <p 142>will\nnot imply that the primitive forms must entirely disappear,\nespecially for the gravest crimes, which, in the biological and\npsychological conditions of those who commit them, take us back to\nthe primitive epochs and forms of individual and social violence.\n\nI end with a modification of an old comparison which has been much\nabused.  Crime has been compared to an impetuous torrent which\nought to be enclosed between the dykes of punishment, lest\ncivilised society should be submerged.  I do not deny that\npunishments are the dykes of crime, but I assert that they are\ndykes of no great strength or utility.  All nations know by sad\nand chronic experience that their dykes cannot save them from\ninundations; and so our statistics teach us that punishments have\nbut an infinitesimal power against the force of criminality, when\nits germs are fully developed.\n\nBut as we can best protect ourselves against inundations by\nobeying the laws of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, by timbering\nthe banks near the source of the stream, and by due rectilineation\nor excavation along its course and near its mouth, so, in order to\ndefend ourselves against crimes, it is best to observe the laws of\npsychology and sociology, and to avail ourselves of social\nsubstitutes, which are far more efficacious than whole arsenals of\nrepressive measures.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n_PRACTICAL REFORMS_.\n\nTHE data of criminal anthropology and statistics, and the positive\ntheory of responsibility which flows from them, although they have\nbeen systematised only by the positive school, are nevertheless\ntoo constantly in evidence not to have made their way into courts\nand parliaments.\n\nI have already spoken of penal jurisprudence in its relations with\ncriminal sociology, and may now cite a few examples of the more or\nless direct and avowed influence of the new data on penal\nlegislation.\n\nThe legislators of to-day, vaguely impressed by statistical and\nbiological, ethnographical and anthropological data, and still\nimbued with the old prejudice of social and political\nartificiality, were at first hurried into a regular mania for\nlegislation, under which every newly observed social phenomenon\nseemed to demand a special law, regulation, or article in the\npenal code.  Then, as Spencer has said in one of his most\nbrilliant essays, the citizen finds himself in an inextricable\nnetwork of laws, decrees, regulations and codes, which surround\nhim, support him, fetter and bind him, even before his birth and\nafter his death.  For<p 143> <p 144>those whom M. Bordier calls\nthe gardeners and trussmakers of society, forgetting the natural\ncharacter of social phenomena, picture society as so much paste,\nto which the cook may give any form he pleases, whether pie-crust,\ndumpling, or tart.\n\nHence we see on all sides, side by side with dogma in the\nclassical sciences of law, economy, and politics, empiricism in\nthe laws themselves.  And that is why the practical defects and\nconstant impotence of repression in penal justice are the most\neloquent arguments of the experimental school, which extends and\nstrengthens its own theoretical inductions by the practical\nreforms which it suggests.\n\nA first example of the influence more directly exercised by the\nnew ideas in penal legislation is furnished by the proposal\nalready realised in the penal laws of Holland, Italy, &c., of two\nparallel systems of punishment by detention--one for the graver\nand more dangerous crimes, and the other, ``simple detention,'' or\n_custodia honesta_ (``as a first-class misdemeanant''), for\ncontraventions, involuntary offences, and crimes not inspired by\nthe baser passions.\n\nSimilarly, the enumeration contained in certain codes, as in\nSpain, and in the old Mancini draft of a penal code in Italy, of\nthe main aggravating and extenuating circumstances common to all\ncrimes and offences, such as the antecedents of the accused,\nvenial or inexcusable passion, repentance and confession of a\ncrime, extent of injury or the like, is only an elementary and\nempiric form of the biological and psychological classification of\ncriminals.\n<p 145>\n\nThus also the foundation of asylums for the detention of lunatic\ncriminals, in spite of their being acquitted of moral\nresponsibility; the more and more vigorous, but often too\nempirical measures against the progressive increase of recidivism;\nthe proposed repressive measures as alternatives to short terms of\ndetention; the reaction against the exaggerations of cellular\nconfinement, which I regard as one of the aberrations of the\nnineteenth century, are all manifest proofs of the more or less\navowed and logical influence of the data of criminal biology and\nsociology on contemporary penal legislation.\n\nThese practical reforms, which, when grafted on the old trunk of\nthe classical theories of crime and punishment, are mere arbitrary\nand misplaced expedients, really represent, when they are\nlogically co-ordinated and completed, the new system of social\ndefence againt{sic} crime, which is based on the scientific data\nand inductions of the positive school, and which it is therefore\nnecessary for us to trace out from its foundations.\n\n\nI.\n\n\nIn the first place, whilst the positive theories largely reduce\nthe practical importance of the penal code, yet they do more to\nincrease the importance of the rules of penal procedure, which are\nintended to give practical and daily effect to penal measures, for\nthe defence of society against criminals.  For, as I maintained in\nthe Italian Parliament, if the penal code is a code for evil-\ndoers, that of penal procedure is a code <p 146>for honest people,\nwho are placed on their trial but not yet found guilty.\n\nThis is all the more true because, if it is possible to have penal\ncodes whose machinery of psychological coercion is planted on a\nplatonic platform of penitentiary systems written out fair in\ntheir symmetrical clauses, but still non-existent, as is the case\nin Italy, this is not possible in regard to penal procedure.  The\nregulations of the code of ``instruction'' must of necessity be\ncarried out by a judicial routine.  The penal code may remain a\ndead letter, as, for instance, when it says that punishment by\ndetention is to be inflicted in prisons constructed with cells;\nfor, happily, the cells necessary in Italy for fifty or sixty\nthousand prisoners (or in France for thirty or forty thousand) are\ntoo expensive to admit of the observance of these articles of the\npenal code--which nevertheless have cost so many academic\ndiscussions as to the best penitentiary system:  ``Auburn,''\n``Philadelphian,'' ``Irish,'' or ``progressive.''  In the\norganisation of justice, on the other hand, every legal regulation\nhas its immediate application, and therefore reforms of procedure\nproduce immediate and visible results.\n\nIt may be added that, if the slight deterrent influence which it\nis possible for punishment to exercise depends, with its\nadaptation to various types of criminals, on the certitude and\npromptitude of its application, the others depend precisely and\nsolely on the organisation of the police, and of penal procedure.\n\nPassing over special and technical reforms which <p 147>even the\nclassical experts in crime demand in the systems of procedure, and\noften rather on behalf of the criminals than on behalf of society,\nwe may connect the positive innovations in judicial procedure with\nthese two general principles:--(1) the equal recognition of the\nrights and guarantees of the prisoner to be tried and of the\nsociety which tries him; and (2) the legal sentence, whereof the\nobject is not to define the indeterminable moral culpability of\nthe prisoner, nor the impersonal applicability of an article in\nthe penal code to the crime under consideration; but the\napplication of the law which is most appropriate to the\nperpetrator of the crime, according to his more or less anti-\nsocial characteristics, both physiological and psychological.\n\nFrom Beccaria onward, penal law developed by reaction against the\nexcessive and arbitrary severity of the Middle Ages--a reaction\nwhich led to a progressive decrease of punishments.  Similarly\nofficial penal procedure in the nineteenth century has been, and\ncontinues to be, a reaction against the medi<ae>val abuses of the\ninquisitorial system, in the sense of a progressive increase of\nindividual guarantees against the domination of society.\n\nAs we considered it necessary in the interests of social self-\ndefence, in the case of criminal law, to combat the individualist\nexcesses of the classical school, so in regard to penal procedure,\nwhilst admitting the irrevocable guarantees of individual liberty,\nsecured under the old system, we think it necessary to restore the\nequilibrium between individual and social rights, which has been\ndisturbed <p 148>by the many exaggerations of the classical\ntheories, as we will now proceed to show by a few examples.\n\nThe presumption of innocence, and therewith the more general rule,\n``in dubio pro reo,'' is certainly based on an actual truth, and\nis doubtless obligatory during the progress of the trial.\nUndetected criminals are fortunately a very small minority as\ncompared with honest people; and we must consequently regard every\nman who is placed on his trial as innocent until the contrary has\nbeen proved.\n\nBut when proof to the contrary is evident, as, for instance, in\nthe case of a flagrant crime, or of confession confirmed by other\nelements in the trial, it seems fit that the presumption should\ncease in view of absolute fact; and especially when we have to do\nwith habitual criminals.\n\nEven the criminals of this class whom I have questioned recognise\na presumption of the opposite kind.  ``They have convicted me,''\nsaid an habitual thief, ``because they knew I might have done it,\nwithout any proof; and they were in the right.  You will never be\nconvicted, because you never stole; and if we happen to be\ninnocent once in a way, that must be set against the other times\nwhen we are not discovered.''  And the ironical smile of several\nof these prisoners, condemned on circumstantial evidence, reminded\nme of a provision which was once proposed in the Italian penal\ncode, under which a person surprised in the attempt to commit a\ncrime, if it was not known what precise form his crime would have\ntaken, was to be found guilty of a less serious offence.  This\nmight be good for an occasional criminal, <p 149>or a criminal of\npassion, but would be absurd and dangerous for habitual criminals\nand old offenders.\n\nThe exaggerations of the presumption ``in dubio pro reo'' are due\nto a sort of mummification and degeneracy of the legal maxims,\nwhereby propositions based upon observation and generalisation\nfrom existing facts continue in force and are mechanically applied\nafter the facts have changed or ceased to exist.\n\nWhat reason can there be for extending provisional freedom,\npending an appeal, to one who has already been found guilty and\nliable to punishment for a crime or offence, under sentence of a\ncourt of first instance?  To presume the innocence of every one\nduring the first trial is reasonable; but to persist in a\npresumption which has been destroyed by facts, after a first\ncondemnation, would be incomprehensible if it were not a\nmanifestly exaggerated outcome of classical and individualist\ntheories, which can only see a ``victim of authority'' in every\naccused person, and in every condemned person also.\n\nAnother point is that of acquittal in case of an equality of\nvotes, especially where born and habitual criminals are concerned.\nI think it would be much more reasonable to restore the verdict of\n``not proven,'' which the Romans admitted under the form of ``non\nliquet,'' as an alternative to ``absolvo'' and ``condemno,'' and\nwhich may be delivered by juries in Scotland.  Every one who has\nbeen put on his trial is entitled to have his innocence declared,\nit it has been actually proved.  But if the proofs remain\nincomplete, his only right is not to be condemned, <p 150>since\nhis culpability has not been proved.  But it is not the duty of\nsociety to declare him absolutely innocent, when suspicious\ncircumstances remain.  In this case the only logical and just\nverdict is one of ``not proven.''  Such a verdict would obliterate\nthe shadow of doubt which rests on persons who have been\nacquitted, by reason of the identical verdicts in cases of proved\ninnocence and inadequacy of proof, and on the other hand it would\navoid the tendency to compromise, under which judges and juries,\nin place of acquitting when the proof is insufficient, sometimes\nprefer to convict, but make the punishment lighter.\n\nAnother case of exaggeration in the presumption of innocence is\nafforded by the regulations as to contradictory or irregular\nverdicts, which may be corrected only when there has been a\nconviction; whilst if the error has led to the acquittal of an\naccused person, it cannot be put right.  The influence of the\nindividualist and classical school is here manifest, for, as M.\nMajno says, ``the justice of sentences rests as much on just\ncondemnations as upon just acquittals.''  If the individual has a\nright to claim that he shall not be condemned through the mistake\nor ignorance of his judges, society also has the right to demand\nthat those whose acquittal is equally the result of mistake or\nignorance shall not be allowed to go free.\n\nOn the same ground of equilibrium between the rights of the\nindividual and the rights of society, which the positive school\naims at restoring, something must be said as to the regulation by\nwhich, if the <p 151>appeal is brought by a condemned person, the\npunishment cannot be increased.  One classical expert in an\nofficial position would not even give the right to appeal at all.\n\nNow if appeal is allowed for the purpose of correcting possible\nmistakes on the part of the original judges, why must we allow\nthis correction in mitigation, and not in increase of punishment?\nAnd to this practical assurance of the condemned person that he\nhas nothing to fear from a second trial, which seems to have been\ngiven to him for the sole purpose of encouraging him to abuse his\npower, since appeals are too often a mere dilatory pretext, there\nis a pendant in the right of the public prosecutor to demand a re-\nhearing, but only ``in the interest of the law, and without\nprejudice to the person acquitted.''\n\nA last instance of the same kind of protective regulation for the\nprotection of evil-doers is to be found in the new trials which\nare permitted only in cases where there has been a condemnation,\nand that on arbitrary and superficial grounds.  Most of the\nclassical commentators on procedure do not dream of the\npossibility of revision in the case of acquittals, and yet, as\nMajno justly says, ``even if he has profited by false witness,\nforged documents, intimidation or corruption of a judge, or any\nother offence, the acquitted person calmly enjoys his boast, and\ncan even plume himself on his own share in the business without\nfear of being put on his trial again.''  The Austrian and German\ncodes of procedure admit revision in cases of acquittal; and the\npositive rule in this connection ought to be that a case should be\n<p 152>re-heard when the sentence of condemnation or acquittal is\nevidently erroneous.\n\nFrom the same principle of equality between the guarantees of the\nindividual criminal and of honest society we infer the necessity\nof greater strictness in the idemnification of the victims of\ncrime.  For the platonic damages now added to all sorts of\nsentences, but nearly always ineffectual, we believe that a strict\nobligation ought to be substituted, the operation of which should\nbe superintended by the State, in the same way as the other\nconsequence of the crime, which is called the punishment.  I will\nreturn to this when I trace the outline of the positive system of\nsocial defence against criminals.\n\nThe positive school, precisely because it aims at an equilibrium\nbetween individual and social rights, is not content with taking\nthe part of society against the individual.  It also takes the\npart of the individual against society.\n\nIn the first place, the very reforms which we propose for the\nindemnification of the victims of crime, regarded as a social\nfunction, as well as the operation of the punishment, have an\nindividualist character.  The individualism of the classical\nschool was not even complete as a matter of fact; for the\nguarantees which it proposed took account of the individual\ncriminal only, and did not touch his victims, who are also\nindividuals, and far more worthy of sympathy and protection.\n\nBut, beyond this, we may point to three reforms as an instance of\nthe positive and reasonable guarantees of the individual against\nthe abuse or the defects of <p 153>social authority.  Of these\nreforms two have been put forward by the classical school also,\nbut, like criminal lunatic asylums, alternatives for short terms\nof imprisonment, and so on, they have generally remained\ninoperative, for they are not in harmony with the bulk of\ntraditional theory, and only in a positive system have they any\norganic and efficacious connection with the data of criminal\nsociology.  I refer to the exercise of popular opinion, the\ncorrection of judicial mistakes, and the transfer of sundry\npunishable offences to the category of civil contraventions.\n\nThe institution of a Ministry of Justice corresponds to the\ndemands of general sociology, which exacts division of labour even\nin collective organisms, and to those of criminal sociology, which\nrequires a special and distinct organ for the social function of\ndefence against crime.  Indeed it has become indispensable as a\nnecessary judicial organ, even in nations like England which have\nnot yet formally established it.  So that, far from confounding\nthe Public Prosecutor with the judicial body, we see the necessity\nof giving to this office a more elevated character and a distinct\npersonality, with ampler guarantees of independence of the\nexecutive power.\n\nNevertheless the action of the Ministry of Justice, as now\ncommonly organised, may be inadequate for the protection of the\nvictims of crime, either indirectly through the insufficient\nnumber of its functionaries, or directly, through the functional\ndefect insisted on by M. Gneist, ``party spirit or prejudice in\nfavour of the governing powers.''  The latter, indeed,\nnotwith<p 154>standing M. Glaser's objection that government\npressure is impossible, have no need to give special instructions,\nof a more or less compromising character, in order to exercise a\nspecial influence in any particular case.  There is no necessity\nfor anything beyond the conservative spirit natural to every\ninstitution of the State, or the principle of authority which is a\nspecial form of it, apart from the less respectable motives of\ninterested subservience to such as are in office and dispense\npromotion.\n\nHence it will be useful, in initiating criminal proceedings, to\nadd to the action of a Public Prosecutor (but not to substitute\nfor him) the action of private persons.\n\nCriminal proceedings by citizens may take two forms, according as\nthey are put in operation only by the injured person or by any\nindividual.\n\nThe first mode, already allowed in every civilised nation, needs\namendment in various ways, especially in regard to the\nsubordination of the penal action to the plaint of the injured\nperson, which ought to be restrained, and even abolished.  In\nfact, whereas this right has hitherto been regulated by law only\nin view of the legal and material gravity of the offence, it\nshould in future be made to depend on the perversity of the\noffender; for society has a much greater interest in defending\nitself against the author of a slight offence if he is a born\ncriminal or a criminal lunatic, than in defending itself against\nthe author of a more serious crime, if he is an occasional\ncriminal or a criminal of passion.  And the necessity of bringing\na private action in regard to certain offences <p 155>is only a\nsource of abuses, and of demoralising bargains between offenders\nand injured persons.\n\nOn the other hand, this prosecution by a citizen who has been\ninjured by a crime or an offence ought to have more efficacious\nguarantees, either for the exercise of the rights of the injured\nperson, or against the possible neglect or abuse of the Public\nProsecutor.  If, indeed, he is obliged to take up every charge and\naction, he is also (in Italy and France, but not in Austria or\nGermany, for instance) the only authority as to penal actions, and\nconsequently as to penal judgments.\n\nIn Italy, out of 264,038 cases which came before the Public\nProsecutor in 1880, six per cent., or 16,058, were ``entered on\nthe records,'' or, in other words, they were not followed up; and\nin 1889, out of a total of 271,279, the number of unprosecuted\ncases was 27,086, or ten per cent. That is, the number had almost\ndoubled in ten years.\n\nIn France the annual average of plaints, charges, and trials with\nwhich the Public Prosecutor was concerned stood at 114,181 in the\nyears 1831-5; at 371,910 in 1876-80; and at 459,319 in 1887.  And\nthe cases not proceeded with were 34,643, or thirty per cent., in\n1831-5; 181,511, or forty-eight per cent., in 1876-80; and\n239,061, or fifty-two per cent., in 1887.  That is to say, their\nactual and relative numbers mere nearly doubled in fifty years.\n\nIs it possible that in ten, or even in fifty years, the moral\nconditions of a nation, and its inclination to bring criminal\ncharges, should be so modified that the number of cases devoid of\nfoundation should have <p 156>been almost doubled?  It is certain\nthat in different nations and different provinces there are\nvarying degrees of readiness to bring charges against lawbreakers\nrather than to take personal vengeance.  But in one and the same\nnation this vindictive spirit and this readiness to bring charges\ncannot vary so greatly and rapidly, especially within ten years,\nas in Italy; for the persistence of popular sentiment is a well-\nknown fact.  It is rather in the disposition of the functionaries\nof the Ministry of Justice, which is far more variable, that we\nmust look for an explanation of this fact, which is also accounted\nfor by the tendency to diminish the statistical records of crime.\n\nNow, why must the citizen who lodges a complaint of what he\nconsiders a crime or offence submit to the decision of the Public\nProsecutor, who has allowed his action to drop?  This\nconsideration has led to the subsidiary penal action, already\nallowed in Germany and Austria, and introduced in the draft codes\nof procedure in Hungary, Belgium, and France, which is a genuine\nguarantee of the individual as against the social authority.  We\nmust not, however, deceive ourselves as to the efficacy or\nfrequency of its operation, especially in the Latin nations, which\nhave none too much individual initiative.\n\nThe second form of private prosecution is that of the ``popular\npunitive action,'' which existed in the Roman penal law--which, it\nmay be said in passing, is not so insignificant as the classical\nschool has supposed.  The statement of M. Carrara, too often\nrepeated, that ``The Romans, who were giants in civil law, are\npigmies in penal law,'' is not in my <p 157>opinion correct.  It\nis true that the Roman penal law was not organised in a\nphilosophical system; but it exhibits throughout the wonderfully\npractical judgment of the Roman jurisconsults; and indeed one\ncannot see why they should have lost this sense when dealing with\ncrimes and punishments.  On the other hand, I am inclined to think\nthat the importance of the Roman civil law has been exaggerated,\nand that the spirit of the _corpus juris_ springs from social and\neconomic conditions so different from our own that we can no\nlonger feel bound to submit to its tyranny.  The penal law of the\nRomans, however, contains several maxims based on unquestionable\ncommon sense, which deserve to be rescued from the oblivion to\nwhich they have been condemned by the dogmatism of the classical\nschool.  Examples of these are the popular punitive action; the\ndistinction between _dolus bonus_ and _dolus malus_, which belongs\nto the theory of motives; the stress laid upon intentions rather\nthan upon their actual outcome; the law of _exceptio veritatis_ in\ncases of slander, which under the pharisaism of the classical\ntheory serves only to give immunity to knaves; the penalty of\ntwofold or threefold restitution for theft, in place of a few days\nor weeks in prison; the condemnation of the most hardened\ncriminals to the mines, instead of providing them with cells, as\ncomfortable as they are ineffectual--apart from the consideration\nthat the firedamp in mines and the unhealthiness of penal\nsettlements would be less mischievous if their victims were the\nmost dangerous criminals rather than honest miners and husbandmen.\n\nTo return to the popular penal action, it is so com<p 158>monly\nadvocated, even by the classical school, that it is necessary to\nsay another word on the subject.\n\nGneist, from his special point of view, proposed that this action\nshould be introduced into penal procedure, as against electoral\nand press offences, offences against the law of public meetings\nand associations, and the abuse of public authority.  But I\nconsider that this action would be a necessary guarantee, in the\ncase of all crimes and offences, for a reasonable and definite\nadjustment of the rights of the individual and of society.\n\nAnother reform, tending to a more effective guarantee of\nindividual rights, is the revision of judicial errors in the\ninterests of all who are unjustly condemned or prosecuted.  Such a\nreform has been advocated also by several members of the classical\nschool; but it seemed only too likely to remain with them a mere\nbenevolent expression of opinion; for it can only be carried into\neffect by curtailing imprisonment, and by a more frequent and\nstringent infliction of fines, as advocated by the positive\nschool.\n\nSanctioned in some special cases, as an exceptional measure--as,\nfor instance, in the last century by the Parliament of Toulouse,\nand in our age by the English Parliament--compensation for\njudicial errors was rendered necessary in France at the end of the\neighteenth century, after a series of unjust condemnations, even\ndeath sentences, which led Voltaire and Beccaria to demand the\nabolition of capital punishment.  In 1781 the Society of Art and\nLiterature at Ch<a^>lonssur-Marne offered a prize for an essay on\nthe subject, and awarded it to Brissot de Warville, for his work,\n<p 159>``Le Sang Innocent Veng<e'>.''  In the records of the\n<E'>tats G<e'>n<e'>raux there were many votes in favour of this\nreform, which Louis XVI. caused to be introduced on May 8, 1788.\nIn 1790 Duport brought in a measure in the Constituent Assembly;\nbut it was rejected after a short discussion in February, 1791,\nduring which the same practical objections were urged as have been\nrepeated up to the present time.  Nevertheless, the Convention\ndecreed special indemnities, as, for instance.  a thousand francs\nin 1793 for one Busset, ``for arbitrary imprisonment and\nprosecution.''  In 1823 the above-named Society at Ch<a^>lonssur-\nMarne proposed the same subject for an essay; and it has been the\nobject of sundry proposals, all rejected, as in 1867 during the\ndiscussion on criminal appeals, on amendments moved by Jules\nFavre, Richard, and Ollivier; and again in 1883 by D<e'>put<e'>\nPieyre, and in 1890 by D<e'>put<e'> Reinach.\n\nThis reform has been advocated by Necker, amongst other writers,\nin his memoir on ``Financial Administration in France,'' and by\nPastoret, Voltaire, Bentham, Merlin, Legraverend, H<e'>lie,\nTissot, and more comprehensively by Marsangy in his ``Reform of\nthe Criminal Law'' (1864).  Marsangy advocated many other\npractical reforms which have since been adopted, in substitution\nfor the objectionable short terms of imprisonment.  More recently\nthe subject has been treated in France by the magistrates Bernard,\nPascaud, Nicolas, Giacobbi, and by the Attorney-Generals Molines,\nJourdan, Houssard, Dupry, Bujard, in their inaugural addresses.\n\nIn Italy there was a notable precedent for this <p 160>reform in\nthe Treasury of Fines, established for Tuscany in 1786, and for\nthe kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the penal code of 1819, for the\npurpose of creating a fund for compensation in cases of judicial\nerror.  In 1886 Deputy Pavesi brought in a measure which was not\ndiscussed; and this indemnification, which had already been\nproposed in 1873 by De Falco, keeper of the seals, in his draft of\nan Italian penal code, was not included in subsequent Bills,\nmainly on account of the financial difficulties.  Amongst writers\non criminology, it was advocated in Italy by Carrara, Pessina, and\nBrusa; in Germany by Geyer and Schwarze; in Belgium by Prins and\nothers, and more recently by M. Garofalo, in his report to the\nthird National Congress on Law, at Florence, in September, 1891.\n\nAmongst existing laws, indemnification for judicial errors,\nwhether limited to cases in which the innocence of condemned\npersons can be proved, or extended to persons wrongfully\nprosecuted, is included in the penal codes of Hungary and Mexico,\nand by special laws in Portugal (1884), Sweden (1886), Denmark\n(1888), and especially in Switzerland, in the cantons of Fribourg,\nVaud, Neuch<a^>tel, Geneva, B<a^>le, and Berne.\n\nThe legal principle that the State ought to indemnify material and\nmoral injury inflicted by its functionaries, through malice or\nnegligence, on a citizen who has done nothing to subject himself\nto prosecution or condemnation, cannot be seriously contested.\nBut the whole difficulty is reduced to deciding in what cases the\nright to indemnification ought to be <p 161>recognised, and then\nto providing a fund out of which the State can discharge this\nduty.\n\nFor the latter purpose it would be necessary to include an\nadequate sum in the Budget.  This was done in Bavaria, in 1888, by\nsetting apart 5,000 marks annually; and the first who profited by\nthis provision received a pension of 300 marks per annum, after\nbeing rendered incapable of work by seven years' imprisonment for\na crime which he had not committed.  But if the policy of\nretrenchment imposed on the European States by their insane\nmilitary expenditure and their chronic wars prevents the carrying\nout of this proposal, there is the Italian precedent of the\nTreasury of Fines, which, with the fines inflicted, or which ought\nto be inflicted on convicted persons, and the product of prison\nlabour, would provide the necessary amount for the indemnities\nwhich the State ought to pay to innocent persons who have been\ncondemned or prosecuted, as well as to the victims of offences.\n\nAs for the cases in which a right to indemnification for judicial\nerrors ought to be acknowledged, it seems to me evident in the\nfirst place that we must include those of convicted persons found\nto be innocent on a revision of the sentence.  Amongst persons\nwrongfully prosecuted, I think an indemnity is due to those who\nhave been acquitted because their action was neither a crime nor\nan offence, or because they had no part in the action (whence also\nfollows the necessity of verdicts of Not Proven, so as to\ndistinguish cases of acquittal on the ground of proved\ninnocence)--always provided that the prosecuted persons have not\ngiven a reasonable pretext for their trial by their <p 162>own\nconduct, or their previous relapse, or their habitual criminality.\n    The third proposition of the positive school in regard to\nindividual guarantees, which was also advanced by M. Puglia, is\nconnected with reform of the penal code, and especially with the\nmore effectual indemnification of the victims of crime.  The\nobject is to prune the long and constantly increasing list of\ncrimes, offences, and contraventions of all acts which result in\nslight injury, committed by occasional offenders, or ``pseudo-\ncriminals''--that is, by normal persons acting merely with\nnegligence or imprudence.\n    In these cases the personal and social injury is not caused\nmaliciously, and the agent is not dangerous, so that imprisonment\nis more than ever inappropriate, unjust, and even dangerous in its\nconsequences.  Deeds of this kind ought to be eliminated from the\npenal code, and to be regarded merely as civil offences, as\n__*simple__ theft was by the Romans; for a strict indemnification\nwill be for the authors of these deeds a more effectual and at the\nsame time a less demoralising and dangerous vindication of the law\nthan the grotesque condemnation to a few days or weeks in prison.\n    It will be understood that the classical theory of absolute\nand eternal justice cannot concern itself with these trifles,\nwhich, nevertheless, constitute two-thirds of our daily social and\njudicial existence; for, according to this theory, there is always\nan offence to be visited with a proportionate punishment, just as\nwith a murder, or a highway robbery, or a slanderous word.\n<p 163>But for the positive school, which realises the actual and\npractical conditions of social and punitive justice, there is on\nthe other hand an evident need of relieving the codes, tribunals,\nand prisons from these microbes of the criminal world, by\nexcluding all punishments by imprisonment for what Venturi and\nTurati happily describe as the atomic particles of crime, and by\nrelaxing in some degree that monstrous network of prohibitions and\npunishments which is so inflexible for petty transgressors and\noffenders, but so elastic for serious evil-doers.\n\n\nII.\n\n    The reforms which we propose in punitive law are based on the\nfundamental principle already established on the data of\nanthropology and criminal statistics.\n    If the ethical idea of punishment as a retribution for crime\nbe excluded from the repressive function of society, and if we\nregard this function simply as a defensive power acting through\nlaw, penal justice can no longer be squared with a minute\ncomputation of the moral responsibility or culpability of the\ncriminal.  It can have no other end than to prove, first, that the\nperson under trial is the author of the crime, and, then, to which\ntype of criminals he belongs, and, as a consequence, what degree\nof anti-social depravity and re-adaptability is indicated by his\nphysical and mental qualities.\n\nThe first and fundamental inquiry in every criminal <p 164>trial\nwill always be the verification of the crime and the\nidentification of the criminal.\n\nBut when the connection of the accused and the crime is once\nestablished, either the accused produces evidence of his honesty,\nor of the uprightness of his motives--the only case in which his\nacquittal can be demanded or taken into consideration--or else it\nis proved that his motives were anti-social and unlawful, and then\nthere is no place for those grotesque and often insincere contests\nbetween the prosecution and the defence to prevent or to secure an\nacquittal, which will be impossible whatever may be the\npsychological conditions of the criminal.  The one and only\npossible issue between the prosecution and the defence will be to\ndetermine, by the character--of the accused and of his action, to\nwhat anthropological class he belongs, whether he is a born\ncriminal, or mad, or an habitual or occasional criminal, or a\ncriminal of passion.\n\nIn this case we shall have no more of those combats of craft,\nmanipulations, declamations, and legal devices, which make every\ncriminal trial a game of chance, destroying public confidence in\nthe administration of justice, a sort of spider's web which\ncatches flies and lets the wasps escape.\n\nThe crime will always be the object of punitive law, even under\nthe positive system of procedure; but, instead of being the\nexclusive concern of the judge it will only be the ground of\nprocedure, and one symptom amongst others of the depravation and\nre-adaptability of the criminal, who will himself be the true and\nliving subject of the trial.  As it is, the whole <p 165>trial is\ndeveloped from the material fact; and the whole concern of the\njudge is to give it a legal definition, so that the criminal is\nalways in the background, regarded merely as the ultimate billet\nfor a legal decision, in accordance with some particular article\nin the penal code--except that the actual observance of this\narticle is at the mercy of a thousand accidents of which the judge\nknows nothing, and which are all foreign to the crime, and to the\ncriminal.\n\nIf we rid ourselves of the assumption that we can measure the\nmoral culpability of the accused, the whole process of a criminal\ntrial consists in the assemblage of facts, the discussion, and the\ndecision upon the evidence.  For the classical school, on the\nother hand, such a trial has been regarded as a succession of\nguarantees for the individual against society, and, by a sort of\nreaction against the methods of legal proof, has been made to turn\nupon the private conviction, not to say the intuition, of the\njudge and counsel.\n\nA criminal trial ought to retrace the path of the crime itself,\npassing backward from the criminal action (a violation of the\nlaw), in order to discover the criminal, and, in the psychological\ndomain, to establish the determining motives and the\nanthropological type.  Hence arises the necessity for the positive\nschool of reconsidering the testimony in a criminal case, so as to\ngive it its full importance, and to reinforce it with the data and\ninferences not only of ordinary psychology, as the classical\nschool has always done (Pagano for instance, and Bentham,\nMitter<p 166>maier, Ellero, and others), but also, and above all,\nwith the data and inferences of criminal anthropology and\npsychology.\n\nIn the evolution of the theory of evidence we may distinguish four\ncharacteristic stages, as M. Tarde observed--the religious stage,\nwith its ordeals and combats; the legal stage, accompanied by\ntorture; the political stage, with private conviction and the\njury; and the scientific stage, with expert knowledge of\nexperimental results, systematically collected and studied, which\nis the new task of positive procedure.\n\nWe must glance at each of the three elements of the criminal\ntrial: collection of evidence (police and preliminary inquiry);\ndiscussion of evidence (prosecution and defence), and decision\nupon evidence (judges and juries).\n\nIt is evident in the first place, as I remarked in the first\nedition of this work, and as Righini, Garofalo, Lombroso, Alongi,\nand Rossi have confirmed, that a study of the anthropological\nfactors of crime provides the guardians and administrators of the\nlaw with new and more certain methods in the detection of the\nguilty.  Tattooing, anthropometry, physiognomy, physical and\nmental conditions, records of sensibility, reflex activity, vaso-\nmotor reactions, the range of sight, the data of criminal\nstatistics, facilitate and complete the amassing of evidence,\npersonal identification, and hints as to the capacity to commit\nany particular crime; and they will frequently suffice to give\npolice agents and examining magistrates a scientific guidance in\ntheir inquiries, which now depend entirely on their individual\nacuteness and mental sagacity.\n<p 167>\n\nAnd when we remember the enormous number of crimes and offences\nwhich are not punished, for lack or inadequacy of evidence, and\nthe frequency of trials which are based solely on circumstantial\nhints, it is easy to see the practical utility of the primary\nconnection between criminal sociology and penal procedure.\n\nThe practical application of anthropometry to the identification\nof criminals, and to the question of recidivism, which was begun\nin Paris by M. Bertillon, and subsequently adopted by almost all\nthe states of Europe and America, is too familiar to need\ndescription.  It will be sufficient to recall the modifications of\nBertillon's system by Anfosso, with the actual collection of\nanthropometric data, and their inclusion in the ordinary records\nof justice.\n\nThus the sphygmographic data on the circulation of the blood,\nwhich reveal the inner emotions, in spite of an outward appearance\nof calm or indifference, have already served to show that a person\naccused of theft was not guilty of it, but that he was on the\ncontrary guilty of another theft, of which he had not been so much\nas suspected.  On another occasion they established the innocence\nof a man condemned to death.  We shall have more speaking and\nfrequent illustrations when these inquiries have been placed\nregularly at the service of criminal justice.\n\nThe sphygmograph may also be useful in the diagnosis of simulated\ndisease, after the example set M. Voisin in the case of a sham\nepileptic in Paris, ``whose sphygmographic lines have no\nresemblance to those of true epileptics before and after a fit,\nand <168>only resemble those produced by normal persons after a\nviolent gesticulation.''\n\nAs for the possible utilisation of hypnotism, we must be cautious\nbefore we draw any legal conclusions from it; but it cannot be\nquestioned that this is a valuable source of scientific aid in the\nsystematic collection of criminal evidence.\n\nBut, for the present, the most certain and profitable aids in the\ncollection of evidence are those afforded by the organic and\npsychical characteristics of criminals.  In my study on homicide I\nreckoned up many psychological and psycho-pathological symptoms\nwhich characterise the murderer, the homicidal madman, and the\nhomicide through passion.  And in my professional practice I have\noften found by experience that there is a great suggestive\nefficacy in these psychological symptoms in regard to the conduct\nof a criminal, before, during, and after a crime; and it is\nimportant to bring this knowledge scientifically before detectives\nand judges.\n\nThese data are not applicable to accused persons exclusively.\nWhen we remember the enormous importance of oral evidence in the\nchain of criminal proof, and the rough traditional empiricism of\nthe criteria of credibility, which are daily applied in all trials\nto all kinds of witnesses, by men who regard them, like the\nprisoners, as an average abstract type--excluding only the\ndefinite cases of inability to give evidence, which are defined\nbeforehand with as much method as the cases of irresponsibility--\nthe necessity of calling in the aid of scientific psychology and\npsycho-pathology is manifest.\n<p 169>\n\nFor instance, not to dwell on the absurd violation of these\ntraditional criteria of credibility, when police officers are\nadmitted as witnesses (often the only witnesses) of resistance to\nauthority or violence, wherein they are doubly interested parties,\nhow often in our courts do we give a thought to the casual\nimaginations or credulity of children, women, weak-nerved or\nhysterical persons, and so on?  Counsel for defence or prosecution\nwho desired to know if any particular witness is or is not\nhysterical would bring a smile to the face of the judge, very\nlearned, no doubt, in Roman law or legal precedents, but certainly\nignorant in physiology, psychology, and psycho-pathology.  Yet the\ntendency to slander in hysterical cases, which M. Ceneri urged so\neloquently in a celebrated trial or the tendency to untruth in\nchildren, which M. Motet has ably illustrated, are but manifest\nand simple examples of this applicability of normal, criminal, and\npathological psychology to the credibility of witnesses.  And,\nunder its influence, how much of the clear atmosphere of humanity\nwill stimulate our courts of justice, which are still too much\nisolated from the world and from human life, where, nevertheless,\nprisoners and witnesses come, and too often come again, living\nphantoms whom the judges know not, and only see confusedly through\nthe thick mist of legal maxims, and articles of the code, and\ncriminal procedure.\n\nApart from these examples, which prove the importance of what M.\nSarraute justly called ``judicial applications of criminal\nsociology,'' the fundamental reform needed in the scientific\npreparation of criminal <p 170>evidence is the creation of\nmagisterial experts in every court of preliminary inquiry.  In a\nquestion of forgery, poisoning, or abortion, the judge has\nrecourse to experts in handwriting, chemistry, or obstetrics; but\nbeyond these technical, special, and less frequent cases, in every\ncriminal trial the basis of inquiry is or ought to be formed by\nthe data of criminal biology, psychology, and psycho-pathology.\nSo that, over and above the knowledge of these sciences which is\nnecessary to judges, magistrates, and police officers, it is most\nimportant that an expert, or several experts in criminal\nanthropology should be attached to every court of criminal\ninquiry.\n\nThis would provide us with an anthropological classification,\ncertain and speedy, of every convicted person, as well as a legal\nclassification of the material fact, and we should avoid the\nscandal of what are known as experts for the prosecution and\nexperts for the defence.  There should be but one finding of\nexperts, either by agreement between them or by a scientific\nreference to arbitration, as in the German, Austrian, and Russian\nsystem; and over this finding the judges and the litigants should\nhave no other power than to call for explanations from the chief\nof the experts.\n\nIn this way we should further avoid the scandal of judges entirely\nignorant of the elementary ideas of criminal biology, psychology,\nand psycho-pathology, like the president of an assize court whom I\nheard telling a jury that he was unable to say why an expert\n``wanted to examine the feet of a prisoner in order to come to a\ndecision about his head.''  This president, <p 171>who was an\nexcellent magistrate and a learned jurist was wholly unacquainted\nwith the elements of the theory of degeneracy, like one of his\ncolleagues whom I heard saying, when the expert spoke of the\nabnormal shape of the ears of a prisoner (in accord with the\ninquiries of Morel and Lombroso), ``That depends on how the hat is\nworn.''\n\nFor in consequence of the assumption, made by Kant amongst others,\nthat questions of mental disease belong to the philosopher rather\nthan to the physician, and of the absurd and shallow idea which\nsuperficial persons entertain of those who are insane, picturing\nthem as constantly raving, the judge or juryman who pins his faith\nto an expert in handwriting thinks himself above the necessity of\ntaking the opinion of an expert in insanity.\n\nIt must be recognised, however, that this foolish assumption is\npartly due to a reasonable anxiety for the public safety, under\nthe sway of the classical theories, which allow the acquittal and\ndischarge of criminals who are found to be of unsound mind.  It\nwill eventually disappear, either by the wider diffusion of\nelementary ideas of psycho-pathology or by the application of\npositive theories, which are far from carrying the proved insanity\nof a prisoner to the dangerous and absurd conclusion of his\nacquittal.\n\nAfter the first stage of the collection of evidence, during which\nwe can admit the legal representation of the accused, especially\nfor the sake of eliciting both sides of the question, without,\nhowever, going so far as the individual exaggerations of complete\npublicity for the preliminary inquiry, we come to the second\n<p 172>stage of procedure, that of the public discussion of the\nevidence.\n\nThe principals in this discussion represent the prosecution\n(public or private) and the defence; and for these, as I cannot go\ninto great detail, I will only mention one necessary reform.  That\nis the institution of a sort of public defence, by a legal officer\nsuch as used to be found in certain of the Italian provinces,\nunder the title of ``advocate of the poor,'' who ought to be on a\npar with the public prosecutor, and to be substituted for the\npresent institution of the official defence, which is a complete\nfailure.\n\nAs for the actual discussion of evidence, when we have established\nthe scientific rules of evidence, based upon expert acquaintance\nwith criminal anthropology, and when we have eliminated all verbal\ncontention over the precise measure of moral responsibility in the\nprisoner, the whole debate will be a criticism of the personal and\nmaterial indications, of the determining motives, and the\nanthropological category to which the accused belongs, and of the\nconsequent form of social defence best adapted to his physical and\npsychical character.\n\nThe practical conclusion of the criminal trial is arrived at in\nthe third stage, that of the decision on the evidence.\n\nSo far as we are concerned, the criminal adjudication has the\nsimple quality of a scientific inquiry, subjective and objective,\nin regard to the accused as a possible criminal, and in relation\nto the deed of which he is alleged to be the author.  We naturally\ntherefore require in the judge certain scientific\n<p 173>knowledge, and not merely the intuition of common sense.\n\nBut as the consultation of the jury, by reason of its inseparable\npolitical aspect, must take place in private, we can only insist\non the fundamental reform of the judicial organisation, which\nalone can realise the scientific principle of criminal\nadjudication.  It was Garofalo who, in the earlier days of the\npositive school, urged that civil and criminal judges ought to be\nwholly distinct, and that the latter ought to be versed in\nanthropology, statistics, and criminal sociology, rather than in\nRoman law, legal history, and the like, which throw no light on\nthe judgment of the criminal.\n\nLearned jurists, proficient in the civil law, are least fit to\nmake a criminal judge, accustomed as they are by their studies to\nabstractions of humanity, looking solely to the juridical\nbearings, inasmuch as civil law is mostly ignorant of all that\nconcerns the physical and moral nature of individuals.  The\ndemoralisation or uprightness of a creditor, for instance, has no\ninfluence for or against the validity of his credit.\n\nThe jurist, therefore, in a matter of criminal adjudication,\nentirely loses sight of the personal conditions of the accused,\nand the social conditions of the community, and confines his\nattention to the deed, and to the maxims of a so-called\nretributive justice.  They who are called upon to try criminals\nought to possess the ideas necessary to the natural study of a\ncriminal man, and should therefore constitute an order of\nmagistrates wholly distinct from that of civil judges.\n<p 174>\n\nThe practical means of securing this fundamental reform of the\njudicial bench ought to begin with the organisation of the\nuniversity, for in the courses of the faculty of law it will be\nnecessary to introduce a more vigorous and modern stream of social\nand anthropological studies, which must also eventually put new\nlife into the ancient maxims of the civil law.\n\nIn the second place, law students at the university ought to be\nadmitted to what Ellero called a science of clinical criminology,\nthat is to interviews with and systematic observations of\nprisoners.  The first Congress of Criminal Anthropology approved\nthe proposal of M. Tarde, upon the following motion of Moleschot-\nFerri:--``The Congress, in agreement with the scientific tendency\nof criminal anthropology, is of opinion that prison authorities,\nwhilst taking necessary precautions for internal discipline, and\nfor the individual rights of condemned prisoners, should admit to\nthe clinical study of criminals all professors and students of\npenal law and legal medicine, under the direction and\nresponsibility of their own professors, and if possible in the\ncharacter of societies for the aid of actual and discharged\nprisoners.''\n\nLastly, a special school should be founded for policemen and\nprison warders, with the object of securing detectives\ndistinguished not only for their personal ability, but also for\ntheir knowledge of criminal biology and psychology.\n\nTo these reforms, which guarantee the scientific capacity of the\ncriminal judge, we must add reforms which would secure his\ncomplete independence of <p 175>the executive authority, which is\nnow the only authority responsible for the advancement and\nallocation of judges.  But this independence would not be exempt\nfrom every kind of control, such as public opinion, and\ndisciplinary authority to some extent distinct from the\n_personnel_ of the bench; for otherwise the judicial authority\nwould soon become another form of insupportable tyranny.\n\nThe most effectual mode of securing the independence of the judges\nis to improve their position in life.  For admitting that a fixed\nstipend, payable every month, makes a man content with a somewhat\nlower figure, still it is certain that in these days, with a few\nhonourable exceptions, the selection of judges is not\nsatisfactory, because low salaries only attract such as could not\nearn more by the practice of their profession.\n\nThe personal character of the bench vitally affects the quality of\nthe government as a whole.  The most academic and exalted codes\nare of little avail if there are not good judges to administer\nthem; but with good judges it matters little if the codes or\nstatutes are imperfect.\n\nIn criminal law the application of the statute to the particular\ncase is not, or should not be, a mere question of legal and\nabstract logic, as it is in civil law.  It involves the adaptation\nof an abstract rule, in a psychological sense, to a living and\nbreathing man; for the criminal judge cannot separate himself from\nthe environment and social life, so as to become a more or less\nmechanical _lex loquens_.  The living and human tests of every\ncriminal sentence reside in <p 176>the conditions of the act, the\nauthor, and reacting society, far more than in the written law.\n\nHerein we have an opportunity of solving the old question of the\nauthority of the judge, wherein we have gone from one excess to\nanother, from the unbounded authority of the Middle Ages to the\nBaconian aphorism respecting the law and the judge, according to\nwhich the law is excellent when it leaves least to the judge, and\nthe judge is excellent when he leaves himself the least\nindependent judgment.\n\nIf the function of the criminal judge were always to be, as it is\nnow, an illusory and quantitative inquiry into the moral\nculpability of the accused, with the equally quantitative and\nByzantine rules on attempt, complicity, competing crimes, and so\nforth--that is to say, if the law were to be applied to the crime\nand not to the criminal, then it is necessary that the authority\nof the judge should be restrained within the numerical barriers of\narticles of the code, of so many years, months, and days of\nimprisonment to be dosed out, just as the Chinese law decides with\nmuch exactitude the length and diameter of the bamboo rods, which\nin the penal system of the Celestial Empire have the same\nprominence as penitentiary cells have with us.\n\nBut if a criminal trial ought to be, on the other hand, a physio-\npsychological examination of the accused, the crime being\nrelegated to the second line, as far as punishment is concerned,\nthe criminal being kept in the front, then it is clear that the\npenal code should be limited to a few general rules on the modes\nof defence and social sanction, and on the constituent\n<p 177>elements of every crime and offence, whilst the judge\nshould have greater liberty, controlled by the scientific and\npositive data of the trial, so that he may judge the man before\nhim with a knowledge of humanity.\n\nThe unfettered authority of the judge is inadmissible in regard to\nthe forms of procedure, which for the prosecuted citizen are an\nactual guarantee against judicial errors and surprises, but which\nshould be carefully distinguished from that hollow and\nsuperstitious formalism which generates the most grotesque\ninanities, such as an error of a word in the oath taken by\nwitnesses or experts, or a blot of ink on the signature of a\nclerk.\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nScientific knowledge of criminals and of crime, not only as the\ndeed which preceded the trial, but also as a natural and social\nphenomenon--this, then, is the fundamental principle of every\nreform in the judicial order; and this, too, is a condemnation of\nthe jury.  Whilst Brusa, one of the most doctrinaire of the\nItalian classical school, foretold a steady decline of the\n``technical element'' in the magistracy, and consequently a\npersistent intervention of the popular influence in the\nadministration of justice, the positive school, on the other hand,\nhas always predicted the inevitable decline of the jury in the\ntrial of crimes and ordinary offences.[16]\n\n\n    [16] It is interesting to observe that Carrara, in spite of\nhis public advocacy of the jury, wrote in a private letter in 1870\n(published on <p 178>the unveiling of his monument at Lucca):--``I\nexpressed my opinion as to the jury in 1841, in an article\npublished in the _Annals of Tuscan Jurisprudence_--namely, that\ncriminal justice was becoming a lottery.  Justice is being\ndeprived of her scales and provided with a dice-box.  This seems\nto me to be the capital defect of the jury.  All other defects\nmight be eliminated by a good law, but this one is inseparable\nfrom the jury. . . .  Even amongst magistrates we may find the\nharsh and the clement; but in the main they judge according to\nlegal argument, and one can always more or less foresee the issue\nof a trial{.??}  But with juries all forecast is rash and\ndeceptive.  They decide by sentiment; and what is there more vague\nand fickle than sentiment{. .??} . . With juries, craft is more\nserviceable to an advocate than knowledge.  I once had to defend a\nhusband who had killed his wife's lover in a caf<e'>.  I\nchallenged the bachelors on the jury, and accepted the married\nmen.  After that, I was sure of success, and I succeeded. . . .\nThis is the real essential vice of the jury, which no legislative\nmeasure could overcome.''\n\n\n\nTheodore Jouffroy, after listening at the University of Pisa to a\nlecture by Carmignani against the jury, said, ``You are defending\nlogic, but slaying liberty.''\n\nApart from the question whether liberty is possible without logic,\nit is nevertheless a fact that there is always a prominent\npolitical character in the jury.  This accounts for the more or\nless declamatory defences of this judicial institution, which is\nno favourite with the criminal sociologist.\n\nAt the end of the eighteenth century, when there was a scientific\nand legislative tendency towards the creation of an independent\norder of magistrates, the French Revolution, mistrusting the whole\naristocracy and social caste, opposed this tendency, believing\nenthusiastically in the omnipotence and omniscience of the people,\nand instituted the jury.  And whilst in the political order it was\ninspired by classical antiquity, in the order of justice it\nadopted this institution from England.  The jury was not\nun<p 179>known to the Republic of Athens and Rome, but it was\ndeveloped in the Middle Ages by the ``barbarians,'' as an\ninstrument which helped the people to escape from tyranny in the\nadministration of the law.  It used to be said that the jury made\na reality of popular sovereignty, and substituted the common sense\nand good will of the people for the cold dogmatism of the lawyers,\npenetrated as they were by class prejudices.  From this point of\nview the jury was too much in accord with the general tendency of\nthe ideas of the day not to be greedily adopted.  It was another\nexample of the close connection between philosophic ideas,\npolitical institutions, and the judicial organisation.\n\nThe jury, transported to the Continent, in spite of the\nimprovements recorded by Bergasse in his report to the Constituent\nAssembly, on August 14, 1789, was a mere counterfeit of that which\nit was, and is, in England.  But its political character is still\nso attractive that it has many supporters to this day, though the\nresults of its employment in various countries are not very happy.\n\nYet, as the jury is a legal institution, we must consider its\nadvantages and defects, both from the political and from the legal\npoint of view, and accept the conclusion forced upon us by the\npredominance of one or the other.\n\nFrom the political standpoint, it is unquestionable that the jury\nis a concession to popular sovereignty; for it is admitted that\nthe power of the law not only originates with the people, but is\nalso directly exercised by them.\n<p 180>\n\nThe jury may also be a guarantee of civic and political liberties\nas against the abuses of government, which are far more easy with\na small number of judges, more or less subordinate to the\ngovernment.\n\nAgain, the jury may be a means of affirming the sentiment of\nequality amongst citizens, each of whom may to-morrow become a\njudge of his equals, and of spreading political education, with a\npractical knowledge of the law.  It is true that, with this\nknowledge of the law, juries also learn the details of every kind\nof crime, without the equally constant evidence of virtuous\nactions; and there is here a danger of moral contagion from crime.\nBut, from the political point of view, it is certain that the jury\nmay awaken, with a knowledge of the law, a consciousness of civic\nduties, which are too frequently undertaken as a forced and\ntroublesome burden.\n\nOn these political advantages of the jury, however, a few remarks\nmay be made.\n\nIn the first place, the concession to popular sovereignty is\nreduced to very small proportions by the limitations of the jury\nlist, and of the functions of the jury, which legislation in every\ncountry is compelled to impose.\n\nThe essential characteristic distinguishing the jury from the\njudge is especially marked by the origin of their authority; for\nthe jury is a judge simply because he is a citizen, whilst the\nmagistrate is a judge only by popular election or appointment by\nthe head of the State.  So that any one who has entered on his\ncivil and political rights, and is of the necessary age,\n<p 181>ought, according to the spirit of the institution, to\nadminister justice on every civil or criminal question, whatever\nits importance, and not only in giving the final verdict, but also\nin conducting the trial.  Yet not only is the ancient trial by\npopular assemblies impossible in the great States of our day, but\nalso faith in the omniscience of the people has not availed to\nprevent all kinds of limitations in the principle of the jury.\nThus the political principle of the jury is such that it cannot be\nrealised without misapprehension, limitation, and depreciation.\n\nIn fact, even in England, where the jury can of its own motion\ndeclare in the verdict its opinions, strictures, and suggestions\nof reform, as arising out of the trial, it is always subject to\nthe guidance of the judge, and it is not employed in the less\nserious and most numerous cases, on which the whole decision is\nleft to magistrates, who apparently are not to be trusted to\ndecide upon crimes of a graver kind.\n\nAnd as for the other political advantages of the jury, experience\nshows us that the jury is often more injurious than serviceable to\nliberty.\n\nIn the first place, in continental States the jury is but an\ninstitution artificially grafted, by a stroke of the pen, on the\norganism of the law, and has no vital connection or common roots\nwith this and other social organisms, as it has in England.  Also\nthe example of classical antiquity is opposed to the institution\nof the jury, which has been imposed upon us by eager imitation and\npolitical symmetry; for if the jury had disappeared amongst\ncontinental nations, this simply means that it did not find in the\nethnic <p 182>types, the manners and customs, the physical and\nsocial environments of these nations, an adequate supply of\nvitality, such as it has retained, for instance through so many\nhistorical changes, amongst the Anglo-Saxons.\n\nAnd if sometimes the jury can withstand the abuses of government,\nstill too frequently it does not withstand its own passions, or\nthe influence of the social class (the _bourgeoisie_ in our own\nday), to which nearly all juries belong.  It is notorious, in\nfact, that the jury is more rigorous in regard to prisoners\naccused of crimes against property than in regard to those accused\nof crimes against the person, especially crimes instigated by\npersonal motives such as hate, vengeance, or the like; for every\njuryman thinks that he himself might be a victim of the exploits\nof a thief, or the attacks of a murderer for the sake of gain;\nwhereas there is less reason to fear a murder provoked by\nvengeance, an outrage, an embezzlement of public money, or the\nlike.  And Macchiavelli said that men would rather have blood\ndrawn from their veins than money from their pockets.\n\nBesides, the same jury which will resist pressure from the\nGovernment does not resist popular pressure, direct or indirect,\nespecially in view of the secrecy of their individual votes.  No\ndoubt there are noble exceptions; but society is made up of\naverage virtues, and only upon them can it count.[17]\n\n\n [17] In Dublin, for the trial of the murderers of Burke and Lord\nFrederick Cavendish, in 1883, the empanelling of the jury was very\ndifficult, for nobody was willing to expose himself to the\nvengeance of the fanatics.\n\n\n\nAnd when it is continually asserted, in the words <p 183>of\nJouffroy, that the jury is an outpost of liberty, or in those of\nCarrara, that it is its necessary complement, we have to remark\nthat this would be true if the jury were instituted by a despotic\ngovernment; but when popular liberties have far more effectual\nguarantees in the political organisation of the State, then this\nquality of the jury is more apparent than real.\n\nIn fine, either the government is despotic, and then juries are\nnot strong enough to preserve liberty, as in England from the time\nof Henry VIII. to that of James II.; or, as Mittermaier said,\n``when authority is corrupt, and the judge is cowardly or\nterrorised, a jury cannot assist in the defence of liberty.''  Or\nelse the government is liberal, and then the judges also are\nindependent, so that there is no need of juries, especially with\nthe guarantees of their independence which I have already\nindicated.\n\nNow history reminds us that the jury is never instituted by\ndespotic governments.  It was refused, for instance, in upper\nItaly by Napoleon in 1815, in Naples by the Bourbons in 1820, in\nLombardy by Austria in 1849, and in our own day in Russia, for\npolitical crimes, though it is allowed for ordinary crimes.\n\nThus the jury, as a political and liberal institution, is oddly\ndestined to be excluded when it would be serviceable, and to be\nuseless when it is admitted.  It reminds us of the destiny of the\nNational Guard.\n\nBut, even in England, the jury is regarded as especially a legal\ninstitution; and the main qualities attributed to it in this\nconnection are moral judgment and private conviction.\n<p 184>\n\nThe law, we are told, has always a certain harshness and\ninsufficiency, for it ought to provide for the future whilst\ngrounding itself on the past, whereas it cannot foresee all\npossible cases.  Progress is so rapid and manifold, in modern\nsociety, that penal laws cannot keep pace with it, even though\nthey are frequently recast--as for instance in Bavaria, which in\none century has had three penal codes, and in France, where an\nalmost daily accumulation of special laws is piled upon the\noriginal text of the most ancient code in Europe.\n\nThe jury, by its moral judgment, corresponding in some degree to\nthe equity of the ancients, is able to correct the _summum jus_\nwith verdicts superior to the written law.  And, in addition, the\njury always follows its private conviction, the inspiration of\nsentiment, the voice of the conscience, pure instinct, in place of\nthe stern and artificial maxims of the trained lawyer.\n\nI do not deny these qualities of the jury; but I very much suspect\nthat they are serious and dangerous vices rather than useful\nqualities in a legal institution.\n\nIn the first place, I believe that the distinction of powers or\nsocial functions, corresponding to the natural law of division of\nlabour, ought not to be destroyed by the jury.  The duty of the\njudicial power, before everything else, is to observe and apply\nthe written law; for if we once admit the possibility that the\njudge (popular or trained) has to amend the law, all guarantee of\nliberty is lost, and the authority of the individual is unlimited.\nAs I have said above, <p 185>we allow the authority of the judge\nonly when we have actual guarantees of his capacity and\nindependence, and always within the limits of the general precepts\nof the law, and under the control of a superior disciplinary\npower.\n\nBut the omnipotence of the jury, liberated from all reasonable\nregulation, with no directing motives for its verdict, and no\npossibility of control, is a two-edged blade, which may sometimes\nimprove upon the law, or at least usefully indicate to the\nlegislator the tendencies of public opinion in regard to a\nparticular crime.  But it may also violate the law, and the\nliberty of the individual, and then we pay too dear for the slight\nadvantage which the jury can confer, and which might be replaced\nby other manifestations of public opinion.  In any case, as\nBentham said, it is better to have our remedy in the law than in\nthe subversion of the law.\n\nAs for private conviction, we willingly admit that no system of\nlegal proof is acceptable.  But it is one thing to substitute for\nthe legal and artificial assurance of the law the assurance of the\njudge who tries the case, and quite another thing to substitute\nfor conviction founded on argument, and for a critical examination\nof the evidence collected during the trial, the blind and simple\npromptings of instinct or sentiment.\n\nEven apart from technical notions, which we consider necessary to\nthe physio-psychological trial of any accused person, social\njustice certainly cannot be dispensed through the momentary and\nunconsidered impressions of a casual juryman.  If a criminal trial\n<p 186>consisted of the simple declaration that a particular\naction was good or bad, no doubt the moral consciousness of the\nindividual would be sufficient; but since it is a question of the\nvalue of evidence and the examination of objective and subjective\nfacts, moral consciousness does not suffice, and everything should\nbe submitted to the critical exercise of the intellect.\n\nTo the instinctive blindness of the judgment of juries we must add\ntheir irresponsibility.\n\nNo doubt if the legislator required from all judges a simple Yes\nor No, then perhaps the jury would be as good as the magistrate.\nBut instead of the unexplained verdict which Carmignani called\n``the method of the cadi,'' we are of opinion that there should\nalways be substituted a sentence based on reasons and capable of\ncontrol, especially in the positive system of criminal procedure,\nwhich demands from the judge an acquaintance with anthropology and\ncriminal sociology, and from his sentence the elements necessary\nto the subsequent treatment of the convict, in agreement with the\ncharacteristics of his individuality and of his crime.\n\nBut not only is the jury devoid of the qualities attributed to it;\nit has a fatal defect, which alone is sufficient to condemn this\ninstitution of the law.\n\nIn the first place, it is not easy to understand how a dozen\njurymen, selected at hazard, can actually represent the popular\nconscience, which indeed frequently protests against their\ndecisions.  In any case, the fundamental conception of the jury is\nthat the mere fact of its belonging to the people gives it the\nright to judge; and as the ancient assemblies are no <p 187>longer\npossible, the essence of the jury is that chance alone must decide\nthe practical exercise of this popular prerogative.\n\nNow these two conceptions of the jury are in manifest\ncontradiction with the universal rule of public end private life,\nthat social functions should be exercised by persons selected as\nmost capable.\n\nThus in everyday life we all require of every labourer the work of\nwhich he is more particularly capable.  No one would dream, for\ninstance, of having his watch mended by a cobbler.  The\nadministration of criminal justice, on the contrary, is demanded\nof any one we chance to come across, be he grocer or man of\nindependent means, painter or pensioner, who may never in his life\nhave witnessed a criminal trial!\n\nThe irregularity of our statutes corresponds to the incapacity of\nindividual jurymen; for it is evident that we cannot impose the\nrigorous process of a special mode of procedure on the first-\ncomer.  And the law heightens the absurdity by plainly declaring\nthat juries must give their decision without regard to the\nconsequences of their verdict!  ``Jurymen fail in their highest\nduty when they have regard to the penal law, and consider the\nconsequences which their verdict may have upon the accused''\n(Article 342 of the French code of criminal procedure).\n\nThat is to say, criminal justice should be based on the neglect of\nthe elementary rule of justice, according to which every man ought\nalways to consider the possible consequences of his actions.  And\nthe criminal law demands from juries this proof of <p 188>their\nblindness (which is fortunately impossible) that they should judge\nblindfold, with no regard for the prisoner, or for the\nconsequences which their verdict may have upon him.\n\nIt was impossible that the advocates of the jury should fail to\nsee the absurdity of these principles; and they have been\ncompelled to slur them over, at any rate in ordinary practice.\n\nIn respect of the composition of juries, restrictions have been\nintroduced, by means of lists of eligible persons, selection by\nlot, the optional exclusion of a certain number of jurymen by the\npublic prosecutor and the defence, &c.  All these expedients,\nhowever, some of which are imposed by necessity, can only insure a\ngeneral and presumptive capacity, for they have the merely\nnegative effect of contributing to exclude the most manifest moral\nor intellectual incapacity.  But the only capacity which is\nnecessary in a judge, which is a special and positive capacity, is\nnot guaranteed by these restrictions, which, after all, are a\nnegation of the very principle of the jury.\n\nAnd even if the jury were always composed of persons of adequate\ncapacity, it would still be condemned by two inevitable arguments\nof human psychology.\n\nFirst, the assembling of several individuals of typical capacity\nnever affords a guarantee of collective capacity, for in\npsychology a meeting of individuals is far from being equivalent\nto the aggregate of their qualities.  As in chemistry the\ncombination of two gases may give us a liquid <p 189>so in\npsychology the assembling of individuals of good sense may give us\na body void of good sense.  This is a phenomenon of psychological\nfermentation, by which individual dispositions, the least good and\nwise, that is the most numerous and effective, dominate the better\nones, as the rule dominates the exceptions.  This explains the\nancient saying, ``The senators are good men, but the Senate is a\nmischievous animal.''\n\nAnd this fact of collective inferiority, not to say degeneracy, is\nobserved in casual assemblies, such as juries, meetings, and the\nlike, far more than in organised and permanent councils of judges,\nexperts, &c.\n\nSecondly, the jury, even when composed of persons of average\ncapacity, will never be able in its judicial function to follow\nthe best rules of intellectual evolution.\n\nHuman intelligence, in fact, both individual and collective,\ndisplays these three phases of progressive development: common\nsense, reason, and science, which are not essentially different,\nbut which differ greatly in the degree of their complexity.  Now\nit is evident that a gathering of individuals of average capacity,\nbut not technical capacity, will in its decisions only be able to\nfollow the rules of common sense, or at most, by way of exception,\nthe rules of reason--that is, of their common mental habits, more\nor less directed by a certain natural capacity.  But the higher\nrules of science, which are still indispensable for a judgment so\ndifficult as that which bears on crimes and criminals, will always\nbe unknown to it.\n<p 190>\n\nAs for the irregularity of the action of a jury, it has been\ndeemed that this can be provided against by the formal distinction\nbetween a decision of fact and a decision of law, in obedience to\nthe advice of Montesquieu, that ``to the popular judgment we\nshould submit a single object, a fact, a single fact.''\n\nBut without dwelling on the remark of Hye-Glunek, that in this way\nthe legal problem, which ought to be as indivisible as the\nsyllogism which creates it, is cut into two parts, it is evident\nthat Cambac<e'>r<e!>s was amply justified in saying, in the\nCouncil of State, that the separation of fact from law is a\nfallacy.\n\nIn fine, not only under the positive system of criminal procedure,\nwhich demands of the judge, in addition to legal conceptions of\ncrime, some anthropological and sociological knowledge of\ncriminals, but even at the present day it is more correct to say\nthat the jury is concerned with the crime--that is, in the words\nof Binding, with a legal fact, and not merely a material fact;\nwhilst the judge is concerned with the punishment.  Thus, in the\nAssize Court, the separation of the judgments is not between fact\nand law, but only between the crime and the punishment\n\nEven admitting the possibility of this separation of fact and law,\nlogic and experience have already belied the assertion of those\nwho say with Beccaria that, ``for the appreciation of facts,\nordinary intelligence is better than science, common sense better\nthan the highest mental faculties, and ordinary training better\nthan scientific.''\n<p 191>\n\nOn the contrary, a criminal trial is not only concerned with the\ndirect perception of facts, but also and especially with their\ncritical reconstruction and psychological appreciation.  In civil\nlaw the fact is really accessory, and both sides may be agreed in\nits exposition, whilst disputing about the application of the law\nto this fact.  But in criminal justice the fact is the principal\nelement, and it is not merely necessary to admit or to decide upon\nthis or that detail, but we have also to regard its causes and\neffects, from the individual and the social point of view, without\nspeaking of the common difficulty of a critical and evidential\nappreciation of a mass of significant circumstances.  So that, as\nEllero said, in a criminal trial the decision as to fact is far\nmore difficult than that as to law.  And by this time daily\npractice has accumulated so many proofs, more or less scandalous,\nof the incapacity of the jury even to appreciate facts, that it is\nuseless to dwell upon them.\n\nTo conclude this question of the jury, it remains to speak of its\ndefects, which are not the more or less avoidable consequences of\na more or less fortunate application of the principle, which might\nbe the case with any social institution, but, on the contrary, are\nan inevitable consequence of the laws of psychology and sociology.\n\nSo far as science is concerned, a fact exists in connection with a\ngeneral law.  For common sense, on the other hand, the actuality\nof the particular fact is the only matter of concern.  Hence the\ninevitable tendency of the jury to be dominated by isolated\n<p 192>facts, with no other guide than sentiment, which,\nespecially in southern races, confines all pity to the criminals,\nwhilst the crime and its victims are all but forgotten.  The very\nkeenness of sentiment which would urge the people to administer\n``summary justice'' on the criminal, when surprised in the fact,\nturns entirely in his favour when he is brought up at the assizes,\nwith downcast mien, several months after the crime.  Hence we\nobtain an impassioned and purblind justice.\n\nAnd the predominance of sentiment over the intelligence of the\njury is revealed in the now incurable aspect of judicial\ndiscussions.  There is no need and no use for legal and\nsociological studies and for technical knowledge; the only need is\nfor oratorical persuasiveness and sentimental declamations.  Thus\nwe have heard an advocate telling a jury that, ``in trials into\nwhich passion enters, we must decide with passion.''  Hence, also,\nthe deterioration of science in the Assize Courts, and its faulty\napplication, and its completely erroneous consequences.\n\nMoreover, the verdict of the jury cannot represent the sum of\nspontaneous and individual convictions--not only in countries\nwhere juries are exposed to all kinds of influences during the\nadjournments of the discussion, but even in England, where\nunanimity is required, and where all communication of the jury\nwith the outer world is forbidden until the end of the trial.  For\nin every case the influence of the most intriguing or most\nrespected jurymen in the jury's room is always inevitable.  So\nthat we have even <p 193>had irresponsible suggestions of public\ndeliberation on the part of the jury.\n\nAgainst these defects of the jury its advocates have set an\nobjection in regard to the trained judge, namely that the habit of\njudging crimes and offences irresistibly inclines the judge to\nlook upon every prisoner as guilty, and to extinguish the\npresumption of innocence even in cases where it would be most\njustified.\n\nThis objection has really a psychological basis; for the\nconversion of the conscious into the unconscious, and the\npolarisation of the intellectual faculties and dispositions, are\nfacts of daily observation, determined by the biological law of\nthe economy of force.  But it is not sufficient to make us prefer\njuries to judges.\n\nIn addition to the fact that this mental habit of judges may be\ncounteracted by a better selection of magistrates under the\nreforms which I have indicated, it is to be observed that this\npresumption of innocence, as we have seen, is not so absolute as\nsome would have us believe, especially in case of a trial which\nfollows upon a series of inquiries and proofs in; the preliminary\nhearing.\n\nAgain, this tendency of judges is restrained and corrected by the\npublicity of the discussions.  And all, or nearly all, the famous\nand oft-repeated instances of judicial errors go back to the time\nof the inquisitorial and secret trial--in regard to which an\ninteresting historical problem presents itself; that is to say the\nco-existence of the inquisitorial trial, which impairs every\nindividual guarantee, with the political liberties of the\nmedi<ae>val Italian republics.\n<p 194>\n\nThis is why the number of acquittals, and of the admission of\nextenuating circumstances, is always very remarkable, even in the\nCorrectional Tribunals, which in Italy show proportions not\ngreatly differing from those of the Assize Courts.\n\nWe must remember that, under our modern penal procedure, it is not\nthe individual guarantees that are lacking, such as the assigning\nof reasons for the sentence, the almost total abolition of\npunishments which cannot be reconsidered, appeals, reversals,\nrevision, which would be still more efficacious under the positive\nsystem which we propose.\n\nOne logical consequence of the psychological objection raised\nagainst judges would be the granting of a jury even in the\nCorrectional Tribunals, though the experience which we have of it\nin the Assize Courts is not so encouraging as to leave many\nadvocates of a jury in the minor courts.\n\nBut a decisive objection, founded on the most positive data of\nsociology, can be raised against the jury.\n\nThe law of natural evolution proves that no variation in the\nvegetable or animal organism is useful or durable which is not the\noutcome of a slow and gradual preparation by organic forces and\nexternal conditions.  Thus an organ which ceases to have a\nfunction to discharge is subject to atrophy, and no new organ is\npossible or capable of development if it is not required by a new\nfunction to which it corresponds.\n\nWhat has been said of organic variations is also true of social\ninstitutions.  And when the jury is contemplated from this point\nof view, we see that <p 195>it has been artificially grafted by a\nstroke of the legislator's pen on the judicial institutions of the\ncontinent, without the long-continued, spontaneous and organic\nconnections which it had, for instance, with the English people.\nThe jury had even disappeared from the continental countries in\nwhich it had left traces of former existence; for it had not found\nin the race-characteristics or the social organism that favourable\nenvironment which is supplied in England by the natural groundwork\nof institutions and principles which, as Mittermaier says, are its\nnecessary correlative.\n\nThe jury, as it has been politically established on the continent\nof Europe, is what Spencer calls a false membrane in the social\norganism, having no physiological connection with the rest of the\nbody politic.  So that it is not yet acclimatised, even in France,\nafter a century of uninterrupted trial.[18]\n\n\n\n[18] The actual state of the law in Europe, so far as regards the\njury for common crimes and offences, is as follows:--England,\nScotland, Ireland, and Switzerland have the jury for assizes and\ncourts of first instance.  France, Italy, Cisleithan Austria,\nIstria, Dalmatia, Rhenish Prussia, Alsace-Lorraine, Bavaria,\nBohemia, Gallicia, Belgium, Roumania, Greece, Portugal, Russia,\nand Malta, have the criminal jury only.  Spain had suspended it,\nbut restored it in 1888.  Prussia, Saxony, Baden, Wurtemberg, have\nthe criminal jury and _echevins_ (bodies of citizens sitting with\nthe judges) for correctional and police cases.  Denmark, Sweden,\nand Finland, have the _echevins_.  Holland, Norway, Hungary,\nSlavonia, Poland, Servia, and Turkey, have neither juries nor\n_echevins__.\n\n\n\nAs for the other bio-sociological law, of single organs for single\nfunctions, it seems to me that if in England the jury and the\nmagistracy have been developed side by side and interwoven, this\nis only a case of organic integration.  But on the continent, as\n<p 196>the jury has been added artificially to the magistracy,\nthis is on the other hand a genuine example of non-natural growth.\n\nAnd if it be said that the jury, as an advance from the\nhomogeneous to the heterogeneous, indicates a higher degree of\nsocial evolution, we must draw a distinction between\ndifferentiations which amount to evolution and those which, on the\ncontrary, are symptoms of dissolution.  Division of labour,\nphysiological or social, is a true evolutionary differentiation;\nwhilst modifications introduced by a disease in the animal\norganism, or by a revolt in the social organism, are but the\nbeginning of a more or less extended dissolution.\n\nNow the jury belongs to the domain of social pathology, for it is\nessentially contrary to the law of the specialisation of\nfunctions, according to which every organ which becomes more\nadapted to a given task is no longer adapted to any other.  It is\nonly in the lower organisms that the same tissue or organ can\nperform different functions, whilst in the vertebrates the stomach\ncan only serve for digestion, the lungs for oxygenation, and so\non.  Similarly in primitive societies, each individual is soldier,\nhunter, tiller of the soil, &c., whilst with the progress of\nsocial evolution every man performs his special function, and\nbecomes unfitted for other labours.  In the jury we have a return\nto the primitive confusion of social functions, by giving to any\nchance comer, who may be an excellent labourer, or artist, a very\ndelicate judicial function, for which he has no capacity to-day,\nand will have no available experience to-morrow.\n<p 197>\n\nIn modern societies, to tell the truth, there is another function\nassigned to all citizens, outside of their special capacity, and\nthat is the electoral duty.  But the cases are very different.\nThe franchise does not demand a labour so difficult and delicate\nas critical judgment, and the reconstruction of the conditions of\nan act and of its author.  It has no direct influence on the\npositive function of the person elected, but on the contrary it is\na confession of the special incapacity of the elector to do what\nhe intrusts to the capacity of the person elected.  The franchise\nis but an elementary function of the assimilation of physiological\nelements in the social organism, which in the animal organism is\nperformed by the aggregate of living cells, and in society by the\naggregate of individuals, not being idiots or criminals, who\npossess the minimum of social energy.\n\nFar different is the administration of criminal justice, a\ntechnical and very noble function, which has nothing in common\nwith the elementary function of the franchise.  I could not indeed\nagree with the assertion of Carrara, who thought it a\ncontradiction to deny to the people any participation in the\nexercise of the judicial authority when they are allowed to\nparticipate in the exercise of legislative authority.  In the\nfirst place, the people have but a very indirect share in the\nlegislative function, and, even where the referendum exists, very\nuseful as I believe it to be, the people have only a simple,\nalmost negative function, to say Yes or No to a law which they\nhave not made, and would have had no technical ability to make.\nThus the argument of Carrara could <p 198>only lead to the popular\nelection of judges, as of legislators, and to a control by the\npeople of the administrative action of the judges when elected No\ndoubt this would have theoretical advantages, though in my opinion\nit would raise practical difficulties, especially in nations which\ndo not possess a very keen conscience and political activity,\nafter enfeeblement by centuries of despotism, or of political and\nadministrative tutelage and centralisation.\n\n\nThe jury, then, is a retrogressive institution, as shown by\nhistory and sociology, for it represents the medi<ae>val and\ninstinctive phase of criminal justice.  It has, indeed, a few\nadvantages (there is always a certain profit in misfortune),\nespecially when it operates on the final outcome of the classical\ntheories--bringing to bear, for instance, an irresistible force\nagainst repeated theft, or murders committed at the instigation of\nothers.  And it has sometimes drawn attention to necessary penal\nreforms, after accepting certain conclusions of the positive\nschool, such as the acquittal of criminals of passion, and\npolitical prisoners, or a greater severity towards habitual\ncriminals.\n\nBut the only possible conclusion from the foregoing criticisms is\nthat the jury should be abolished for the trial of common crimes,\n_*after_ the introduction of reforms which would ensure the\ncapacity and independence of the judges.\n\nMeanwhile, since it is much easier to establish a new social\ninstitution than to abolish one, it is worth while to indicate the\nprincipal and most urgent reforms which should be made in the jury\nsystem, so <p 199>as to eliminate its more serious and frequent\ndisadvantages.\n\nThe theoretical distinction of the classical school between\nordinary and political crimes is not very precise, for the so-\ncalled political crimes are either not crimes (as when they are\nconfined to the manifestation of an idea), or they are common\ncrimes which spring from a lofty and social passion in\nindividuals, who have the characteristics of the criminal by\npassion, or, in other words,--are but quasi-criminals; or else\nthey are common crimes committed by ordinary malefactors, under\nthe pretext of a popular idea.  Instead of distinguishing crimes,\nI think we ought to distinguish between ordinary and political\ncriminals, according to their determining motives, and the social\nbearings and historical moment of their acts.  At the same time,\nwhilst our criminal laws retain this distinction, I think it is\nuseful to keep the jury for the trial of political crimes and\noffences, and for those connected with the press and with society\nas a whole; for if in these cases the jury might yield to the\ninfluence of class interests and prejudices (as for instance in\nthe trial of actions arising out of the conflict of capital and\nlabour), the danger will still be less than it would be with\njudges alone, who are not sufficiently independent of the\nexecutive, which in its turn is but the secular arm of the\ndominant class, and which therefore combines the interests and\nprejudices of the political order with those of the economic and\nmoral order which dominate the jury.\n\nFor common crimes it would be necessary to with<p 200>hold from a\njury the trial of prisoners who avow their crime.  The essence of\na trial by indictment is the principle that the discussion as to\npunishment is a private affair, and it has no further ground for\nexistence when one of the parties withdraws from the duel.  Hence\nthe English mistrust of a prisoner's confession of guilt, which in\nthe inquisitorial trial, on the other hand, is a mainstay of the\nevidence.  Yet I believe that in these cases the Scottish system\nis preferable to the English.  In England the judge begins by\nasking the prisoner if he is Guilty or Not Guilty, and in case of\na confession he passes sentence without a verdict from the jury.\nIn Scotland, on the contrary, the prosecutor can furnish his\nproof, in spite of the confession of the prisoner, and demand a\nverdict from the jury.  In this way it is possible to avoid not\nonly a scandalous acquittal of prisoners who have confessed their\nguilt (as happens in Italy, France, and elsewhere), but also the\ndanger that the confession may not be true, and that an innocent\nman may be condemned.\n\nJuries ought, moreover, as proposed by M. Ellero, to specify\nattenuating circumstances, on each of which a special question\nought to be put to them.\n\nThe jury ought also to have the right of spontaneously finding in\na sense less serious than that of the charge, even when no\ncorresponding question has been put to them.\n\nBut at the same time it cannot be denied that these would only be\npalliatives, more or less efficacious.\n\nThe only positive conclusion is that, whilst retaining the jury\nfor crimes of the political and social <p 201>order, we should aim\nat its abolition for common crimes, immediately after securing\nstringent reforms as to the independence and capacity of the\njudges.\n\n\nIV.\n\nIt needs no further demonstration that the modern organisation of\npunishment, based partly on the assumption that we can measure the\nmoral culpability of criminals, and partly on an illusion as to\ntheir general amendment, and almost entirely reduced, in\nconsequence, to imprisonment and the cell system, has absolutely\nfailed to protect society against crime.\n\nHoltzendorff, one of the best known of the classical school,\nfrankly confessed that ``the prison systems have made shipwreck.''\nSo also in Italy we have had disquisitions ``on the futility of\nrepression,'' and in Germany it has been held that ``existing\ncriminal law is powerless against crime.''  Thus the necessity of\ntaking steps to counteract this failure is forced upon us more and\nmore every day.  We must proceed either by way of legislative\nreforms, as effectual as we can make them, but always inspired by\nreaction against the established prison system, or by a propaganda\non scientific lines.  The most striking form which has been taken\nby the latter process is the International Union of Penal Law,\nwhich in 1891, two years after its foundation, numbered nearly six\nhundred members of various nationalities, and which in the second\nclause of its charter, in spite of the varied reservations of a\nfew members, notably supported the positive theories.\n\nThe defects of the penal system inspired by the <p 202>theories of\nthe classical school of criminal law, and by the actual\nregulations of the classical prison school, may be briefly summed\nup.  They are, a fallacious scale of moral responsibility;\nabsolute ignorance and neglect of the physio-psychological types\nof criminals; intervals between verdict and sentence on the one\nhand, and between the sentence and its execution on the other,\nwith a consequent abuse of pardons; disastrous practical effects\nof corruption and of criminal association in prisons; millions of\npersons condemned to short terms of imprisonment, which are\nfoolish and absurd; and a continuous, inexorable increase of\nrecidivism.\n\nSo that the tribunals of Europe, as M. Prins observed, with the\nabsolute impersonality of modern justice, allow their sentences to\nfall upon unhappy wretches as a tap allows water to fall drop by\ndrop upon the ground.\n\nWithout counting fines or police detention, there were sentenced\nin Italy, in the ten years 1880-89, to various terms of\nimprisonment, 587,938 persons by the Pretors, and 465,130 by the\nCorrectional Tribunals.  That is, more than a million terms in the\nminor courts within ten years!\n\nAnd the total number sentenced in Italy to various punishments, by\nPretors, Tribunals, and Assize Courts, in the same ten years, was\nnot less than 3,230,000.\n\nAs for recidivism, without repeating the familiar figures of its\nannual increase, it will suffice to recall the astounding fact to\nwhich I drew attention before the central Commission of Legal\nJudicial Statistics.  <p 203>That is to say, amongst the prisoners\ncondemned in 1887 for simple homicide, there were 224 who had been\nalready condemned, either _*for the same crime_ (63), or for a\ncrime mentioned in the same section of the penal code (181); and\neven of those condemned for qualified manslaughter, 78 had already\nbeen condemned, either _*for the same crime_ (8), or for one of\nlike character.\n\nIn France we have figures equally striking, for they relate not to\nthe effect of exceptional conditions, or conditions peculiar to\nthis or that country, but to the uniform consequence of the\nclassical theories of criminal law and prison organisation.\n\nThe total number condemned to imprisonment by the French\ntribunals, and detained by the police, in the ten years 1879-88,\nwas 1,675,000; the Tribunal sentences under six days being\n113,000.\n\nAnd the total condemned to punishments of various kinds, by Assize\nCourts, Tribunals, and police courts, reached in the same ten\nyears the enormous number of 6,440,000 individuals!\n\nThe meaning of this is that penal justice at the present moment is\na vast machine, devouring and casting up again an enormous number\nof individuals, who lose amongst its wheels their life, their\nhonour, their moral sense, and their health, bearing thenceforth\nthe ineffaceable scars, and falling into the ever-growing ranks of\nprofessional crime and recidivism, too often without a hope of\nrecovery.[19]\n\n\n\n[19] As regards recidivism and the enormous numbers tried, England\nis in as bad a position as Italy and France.  See my articles in\n_Nineteenth Century__, 1892, and _Fortnightly Review__, 1894.--ED.\n\n\n\nIt is impossible, then, to deny the urgent necessity <p 204>of\nsubstituting for our present penal organisation a better system\ncorresponding to the governing conditions of crime, more effectual\nfor social defence, and at the same time less gratuitously\ndisastrous for the individuals with whom it deals.\n\nThe positive school, in addition to the partial reforms proposed\nby Lombroso, and by myself in the second edition of this work, has\nput forward in the _Criminology_ of Garofalo a ``rational system\nof punishment,'' whereof it is desirable to give a summary.\n\n\nI.

Liszt also, agreeing with the positive school in regard to the\nnecessity of a radical reform in the penal system, yet with\ncertain reservations, has propounded a scheme, which, however, as\nit does not sufficiently consider various classes of criminals,\nwhom he divides merely into the habitual and the occasional, would\nneed completion, especially in comparison with the well-reasoned\nscheme of Garofalo.  M. Liszt's system is as follows:--\n\n_Punishment by fines_.\n\nIn proportion to the property of the\n     offender--not alternative with          For _offences_ (with alternative\n     imprisonment                               imprisonment).\n\nCapable of being worked out by               For _contraventions of the law_\n     forced labour without imprisonment         (without imprisonment).\n\n_Conditional sentences_.\n\nFor first offenders condemned to\n     imprisonment, with or without           For _offences_ punishable by\n\nsureties for three years                   imprisonment.\n\n<p 207>\n__Imprisonment_ (for an indeterminate period, a maximum and minimum\n\nbeing enacted).\nSeparate confinement--six weeks to two years.\n\nHouse of detention (separate for             2 to 15 years (with police\n     one year, then gradual relaxation          supervision and assistance of\n                                                discharged prisoners)--or for life.\n\n_Indemnifications_ (always as a civil liability) added to other penalties.\n\n\n\nI believe, however, that it is necessary, before laying down\npractical and detailed schemes, more or less complete, to\nestablish certain general criteria, based upon the\nanthropological, physical, and social data of crime, such as may\nlead up to a positive system of social defence.\n\nThese fundamental criteria, it seems to me, can be reduced to the\nthree following:--(1) No fixity in the periods of segregation of\ncriminals; (2) the social and public character of the exaction of\ndamages; (3) the adaptation of defensive measures to the various\ntypes of criminals.\n\n1. For every crime which is committed, the problem of punishment\nought no longer to consist in administering a particular dose, as\nbeing proportionate to the moral culpability of the criminal; but\nit should be limited to the question whether by the actual\nconditions (breach of law or infliction of injury) and by the\npersonal conditions (the anthropological type of the criminal) it\nis necessary to separate the offender from his social environment\nfor ever, or for a longer or shorter period, according as he is or\nis not regarded as capable of being restored to society, or\nwhether it is sufficient to exact from him a strict reparation of\nthe injury which he has inflicted.\n\nUnder this head there is a radical contradiction.  <p 208>The\nexisting schemes of punishment, differing in their machinery (and\nout of harmony with the sentence of the judge, often even with the\nterms of the law), are all based on the principle of fixed periods\nof punishment, graduated into hundreds and thousands of possible\ndoses, and have regard far more to the crime than to the criminal.\nOn the other hand we have the positive system of punishment, based\non the principle of an _unfixed segregation_ of the criminal,\nwhich is a logical consequence of the theory that punishment ought\nnot to be the visitation of a crime by a retribution, but rather a\ndefence of society adapted to the danger personified by the\ncriminal.\n\nThis principle of unfixed punishment is not new, but it is only\nthe positive theory which has given it system and life.  The idea\nof justice as assigning punishment to a crime, measured out by\ndays and weeks, is too much opposed to the principle of the\nindeterminate sentence to allow it to receive any systematic trial\nunder the sway of the classical theories.  There has been only an\nisolated and exceptional use of it here and there, such as the\nseclusion of mad criminals in special asylums, ``during her\nMajesty's pleasure,'' in England.  Nevertheless, personal freedom\n(which is held to be violated by seclusion for unfixed periods) is\ngreatly respected by the English people.\n\nThe fundamental principle of law is that of a restriction imposed\nby the necessity of social existence.  It is evident, therefore,\nto begin with, that seclusion for an unfixed period, as for life,\nis in no way irreconcilable with this principle of law, when\n<p 209>imposed by necessity.  Thus it has been proposed, even by\nthe classical school, as a mode of compensation or adjustment.\n\nIf, indeed, we admit an increase of punishment for a first\nrelapse, it is logical that this increase should be proportional\nto the number of relapses, until we come to perpetual seclusion or\ntransportation, and even to death, as under the medi<ae>val laws.\nSo that there are some of the classical school who, by way of\nbeing logical if not practical, and refusing to admit progressive\nincrease, begin by refusing increase in any degree, even for a\nfirst relapse.\n\nMoreover, if the jurists agree in allowing conditional liberation,\nbefore the term assigned in the sentence, when the prisoner seems\nto have given proof of amendment, the natural consequence, by mere\nabstract logic, ought to be a prolongation of punishment for the\nprisoner who is not amended, but continues to be dangerous.\n\nThis is admitted, amongst others, by Ortolan, Davesies de\nPont<e!>s, and Roeder, who quote as favourable, though only for\nrecidivists, Henke Stelzer, Reichmann, Mohl, Groos, von Struve,\nvon Lichtenberg, G<o:>tting, Krause, Ahrens, Lucas Bonneville,\nConforti, and others, amongst students of criminality; and\nDucpetiaux, Ferrus, Thomson, Mooser, Diez, Valentini, and D'Alinge\namongst prison experts.\n\nAfter this first period, the principle of segregation for an\nunfixed term, as a basis for the penal system, has been supported\nby Despine, and developed by a few German writers.  These latter\nhave insisted <p 210>especially on the disadvantages of the penal\nsystems inspired by the classical theories, though they run\nsomewhat to excess, like Mittelst<a:>dt, who proposed the re-\nestablishment of the brutal punishment of flogging.\n\nIn corporal punishments, it is true, there would be a certain gain\nof efficaciousness, particularly against such hardened offenders\nas the born criminals, so that there is a reaction in favour of\nthese punishments.  M. Roncati, for instance, writing of prison\nhygiene, says that he would be glad to see ``the maternal\nr<e'>gime,'' with its salutary use of physical pain before the\nchild has developed a moral sense; and if flogging is\nobjectionable, resort might be had to electricity, which is\ncapable of giving pain without being dangerous to health or\nrevolting.  Similarly Bain says that the physiological theory of\npleasure and pain has a close relation to that of rewards and\npunishments, and that, as punishment ought to be painful, so long\nas it does not injure the convict's health (which imprisonment is\njust as likely to do), we might have recourse to electric shocks,\nwhich frighten the subject by their mysterious power, without\nbeing repugnant.  Again, the English Commission of Inquiry into\nthe results of the law of penal servitude declared in its report\nthat, ``In English prisons, disciplinary corporal punishments\n(formerly the lash, then the birch) are inflicted only for the\nmost serious offences.  The evidence has shown that in many cases\nthey produce good results.''\n\nNevertheless corporal punishments, as the main form of repression,\neven when carried out with less <p 211>barbarous instruments, are\ntoo deeply opposed to the sentiment of humanity to be any longer\npossible in a penal code.  At the same time they are admissible as\ndisciplinary punishments, under the form of cold baths, electric\nshocks, &c., all the more because, whether prescribed by law or\nnot, they are inevitable in prisons, and, when not regulated by\nlaw, give rise to many abuses, as was shown at the Stockholm\nPrison Conference in 1878.\n\nI agree with Kirchenheim that Dr.  Kraepelin's scheme of seclusion\nfor unfixed periods is more practical and hopeful.  When the\nmeasure of punishment is fixed beforehand, the judge, as Villert\nsays, ``is like a doctor who, after a superficial diagnosis,\norders a draft for the patient, and names the day when he shall be\nsent out of hospital, without regard to the state of his health at\nthe time.''  If he is cured before the date fixed, he must still\nremain in the hospital; and he must go when the time is up, cured\nor not.\n\nSemal reached the same conclusion in his paper on ``conditional\nliberation,'' at the second Congress of Criminal Anthropology.\n\nAnd this notion of segregation for unfixed periods, put forward in\n1867 for incorrigible criminals by the Swiss Prison Reform\nAssociation, has already made great progress, especially in\nEngland and America, since the Prison Congress of London (1872)\ndiscussed this very question of indefinite sentences, which the\nNational Prison Congress at Cincinnati had approved in the\npreceding year.\n\nIn 1880 M. Garofalo and I both spoke in favour of\n<p 212>indefinite segregation, though only for incorrigible\nrecidivists; and the same idea was strikingly supported in M. Van\nHamel's speech at the Prison Congress at Rome (1885).  The\neloquent criminal expert of Amsterdam, speaking ``on the\ndiscretion which should be left to the judge in awarding\npunishment,'' made a primary distinction between habitual\ncriminals, incorrigible and corrigible, and occasional criminals.\n``For the first group, perpetual imprisonment should depend on\ncertain conditions fixed by law, and on the decision of the judge\nafter a further inquiry.  For the second group, the application of\nan undefined punishment after the completion of the first sentence\nwill have to depend in the graver cases on the conditions laid\ndown by law, and in less serious cases upon the same conditions\ntogether with the decision of the judge, who will always decide\nfrom time to time, after further inquiry, as to the necessity for\nprolonging the imprisonment.  For the third group, the judge will\nhave to be limited by law, in deciding the punishment, by special\nmaximums, and with a general minimum.''\n\nThe Prison Congress of Rome naturally did not accept the principle\nof punishment for unfixed periods.  More than that, advancing on\nthe classical tendency, it decided that ``the law should fix the\nmaximum of punishment beyond which the judge may not in any case\ngo; and also the minimum, which however may be diminished when the\njudge considers that the crime was accompanied by extenuating\ncircumstances not foreseen by the law.''\n\nIt is only of late years, in consequence of the reaction\n<p 213>against short terms of imprisonment, that the principle of\nsegregation for unfixed periods has been developed and accepted by\nvarious writers, in spite of the feeble objections of Tallack,\nWahlberg, Lamezan, von Jagemann, &c.\n\nApart, also, from theoretical discussion, this principle has been\napplied in a significant manner in the United States, by means of\nthe ``indeterminate sentence.''  The House of Correction at Elmira\n(New York) for young criminals carries into effect, with special\nregulations of physical and moral hygiene, the indeterminate\nimprisonment of young prisoners; and this principle, approved by\nthe Prison Congresses at Atalanta{sic} (1887), Buffalo (1888), and\nNashville (1889), has been applied also in the New York prisons,\nand in the States of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and\nOhio.\n\nM. Liszt proposes that the indeterminate character of punishment\nshould be only relative, that is to say, limited between a minimum\nand a maximum, these being laid down in the sentence of the judge.\nSpecial commissions for supervising the administration of\npunishment, consisting of the Governor of the prison, the Public\nProsecutor, the judge who heard the case, and two members\nnominated by Government (instead of the court which passed\nsentence, as proposed by Villert and Van Hamel), should decide on\nthe actual duration of the punishment, after having examined the\nconvict and his record.  Thus these commissions would be able to\nliberate at once (with or without conditions) or to order a\nprolongation of punishment, especially for habitual criminals.\n<p 214>\n\nWith the formation of these commissions there might be associated\nthe prison studies and aid of discharged prisoners referred to on\na former page.\n\nBut I think that this proposal of M. Liszt is acceptable only for\ncommissions of supervision, or of the execution of punishment,\nsuch as already exist in several countries, with a view solely to\nprison administration and benevolence, and in which of course the\nexperts of criminal anthropology ought to take part, who, as I\nhave suggested, should be included in every preliminary criminal\ninquiry.  As for the determination of the maximum and minimum in\nsuch a sentence, I believe it would not be practicable; the acting\ncommissions might find it necessary to go beyond them, and it\nwould be opposed to the very principle of indeterminate\nsegregation.  The reason given by M. Liszt, that with this\nprovision the contrast with actual systems of punishment would be\nless marked, does not seem to me decisive; for the principle we\nmaintain is so radically opposed to traditional theories and to\nlegislative and judicial custom that this optional passing of the\nlimits would avoid no difficulty, whilst it would destroy the\nadvantages of the new system.\n\nIn other words, when the conditions of the act committed and the\ncriminal who has committed it show that the reparation of the\ndamage inflicted is not sufficient by way of a defensive measure,\nthe judge will only have to pronounce in his sentence an\nindefinite detention in the lunatic asylum, the prison for\nincorrigibles, or the establishments for occasional criminals\n(penal colonies, &c.).\n\nThe execution of this sentence will be rendered <p 215>definite by\nsuccessive steps, which will no longer be detached, as they now\nare, from the action of the magistrate, and taken without his\nknowledge, but will be a systematic continuation of his work.\nPermanent commissions for the supervision of punishment, composed\nof administrative functionaries, experts in criminal anthropology,\nmagistrates, and representatives of the Public Prosecutor and the\ndefence, would render impossible that desertion and oblivion of\nthe convict which now follow almost immediately on the delivery of\nthe sentence, with the execution of which the judge has nothing to\ndo, except to see that he is represented.  Pardon, or conditional\nliberation, or the serving of the full punishment, are all left at\npresent to the chance of a blind official routine.  These\ncommissions would have great social importance, for they would\nmean on one hand the protection of society against imprudent\nliberation of the most dangerous criminals, and on the other hand\nthe protection of the less dangerous against the danger of an\nimprisonment recognised as excessive and unnecessary.\n\n\nAllied to the principle of indeterminate segregation is that of\nconditional release, which with the progressive prison system,\nknown as the Irish, is now accepted in nearly all European\ncountries.  But conditional liberation in the system of definite\npunishments, without distinction amongst the types of criminals,\nis both contradictory in theory and ineffectual in practice.  At\npresent, indeed, it has only a mechanical and almost impersonal\napplica<p 216>tion, with one fallacious test, that of the alleged\n``good conduct'' of the prisoner, which, according to the English\nInquiry Commission in 1863, ``can only have the negative value of\nthe absence of grave breaches of discipline.''\n\nIt will be understood that conditional release, as it would be\norganised in the positive system of indeterminate segregation,\nought only to be granted after a physio-psychological examination\nof the prisoner, and not after an official inspection of\ndocuments, as at present.  So that it will be refused, no longer,\nas now, almost exclusively in regard to the gravity of the crime,\nbut in regard to the greater or less re-adaptability of the\ncriminal to social conditions.  It will therefore be necessary to\ndeny it to mad and born criminals who are guilty of great crimes.\n\nConditional liberation is now carried out under the special\nsupervision of the police; but this is an ineffectual measure for\ncrafty criminals, and disastrous for occasional criminals, who are\nshut out by the supervision from re-adaptation to normal\nexistence.  The system of indeterminate segregation renders all\nspecial supervision useless.  Moreover, this duty only distracts\npolicemen by compelling them to keep an eye on a few hundred\nliberated convicts, and to neglect thousands of other criminals,\nwho increase the number of unknown perpetrators of crime.\n\nSimilarly as to the discharged prisoners' aid societies, which,\nnotwithstanding their many sentimental declamations, and the\nexcellence of their intentions, continue to be as sterile as they\nare benevolent.  The reason here also is that they <p 217>forget\nto take into account the different types of criminals, and that\nthey are accustomed to give their patronage impartially to all\ndischarged prisoners, whether they are reclaimable or not.  It\nmust not be forgotten, moreover, that this aiding of malefactors\nought not to be exaggerated when there are millions of honest\nworkmen more unfortunate than these liberated prisoners.  In spite\nof all the sentimentalism of the prisoners' aid societies, I\nbelieve that a foreman will always be in the right if he chooses\nan honest workman for a vacancy in his workshops in preference to\na discharged prisoner.\n\nAt the same time these societies may produce good results if they\nconcern themselves solely with occasional criminals, and\nespecially with the young, and make their study of crime\ncontribute to the training of future magistrates and pleaders.\n\n\n2. The second fundamental principle of the positive system of\nsocial defence against crime is that of indemnification for\ndamage, on which the positive school has always dwelt, in\ncombination with radical, theoretical, and practical reforms.\n\nReparation of damage suffered by the victims of crime may be\nregarded from three different points of view:--(1) As an\nobligation of the criminal to the injured party; (2) as an\nalternative for imprisonment for slight offences committed by\noccasional criminals; and (3) as a social function of the State on\nbehalf of the injured person, but also in the indirect and not\nless important interest of social defence.\n<p 218>\n\nThe positive school has affirmed the last two reforms--the second\non the initiative of Garofalo and Puglia, and the third on my own\nproposal, which, as being more radical, has been more sharply\ncontested by the classical and eclectic schools.\n\nIn my treatise on ``The Right of Punishment as a Social\nFunction,'' I said:  ``Let us not be told that __civil__\nreparation is no part of _penal_ responsibility.  I can see no\nreal difference between the payment of a sum of money as a fine\nand its payment as damages; but more than that, I think a mistake\nhas been made in separating civil and penal measures too\nabsolutely, whereas they ought to be conjoined for defensive\npurposes, in preventing certain particular anti-social acts.''\nAnd again, classifying the measures of social defence (``measures\nof prevention, reparation, repression, and elimination''), I said\nin regard to measures of reparation:  ``Our proposed reform is not\nintended to be theoretical merely, for indeed it may be said\nalready that this liability to indemnify is established in the\nmajority of cases; but it should be above all a practical reform,\nin the sense that, instead of separating civil and penal measures,\nwe shall make their joint application more certain, and even\nrequire special regulations to compel the criminal judges, for\ninstance, to assess the damages, and so avoid the delays and\nmischances of a new trial before the civil judges, and to compel\nthe Public Prosecutor to make an official demand, even when\nthrough ignorance or fear there is no action on the part of the\ninjured person, that the criminal should be condemned to make good\nthe loss which he has <p 219>inflicted.  It will then be seen that\nthe fear of having to make strict restitution will be a spur to\nthe diligence of the well-to-do, in regard to involuntary\noffences, whilst for the poor we shall be able to impose work on\nbehalf of the injured person in place of pecuniary damages.''\n\nShortly afterwards Garofalo wrote:  ``In the opinion of our\nschool, for many offences, especially slighter offences against\nthe person, it would be serviceable to substitute for a few days'\nimprisonment an effectual indemnification of the injured party.\nReparation of damage might become a genuine penal substitute, when\ninstead of being, as now, a legal consequence, a right which can\nbe enforced by the rules of civil procedure, it would become an\nobligation from which the accused could in no way extract\nhimself.''\n\nOf all the positive school, Garofalo has insisted most strongly on\nthese ideas, enlarging upon them in various proposals for the\npractical reform of procedure.\n\nThe principle has made further progress since the speech of M.\nFioretti at the first Congress of Criminal Anthropology (Rome,\n1885), which adopted the resolution brought forward by MM. Ferri,\nFioretti, and Venezian:  ``The Congress, being convinced of the\nimportance of providing for civil indemnification, in the\nimmediate interest, not only of the injured party, but also of\npreventive and repressive social defence, is of opinion that\nlegislation could most expeditiously enact the most suitable\nmeasures against such as cause loss to other persons, and against\ntheir accomplices and abettors, by treating the recovery of\ndamages as a social function as<p 220>signed to its officials,\nthat is to say, to the Public Prosecutor at the bar, to the judges\nin their sentences, to the prison officials in the ultimate\npayment for prison labour, and in the stipulation for conditional\nrelease.''\n\nThe classical principle that indemnification for loss caused by an\nunlawful act is a purely civil and private obligation of the\noffender (like that created by any breach of contract!), and that\nin consequence it ought to be essentially distinct from the penal\nsentence which is a public reparation, has inevitably caused the\ncomplete oblivion of indemnification in every-day judicial\npractice.  For the victims of crime, finding themselves compelled\nto resort to the courts, and fearing the expense of a civil trial\nto give effect to the sentence of damages and interest thereon,\nhave been driven to abandon the hope of seeing their loss actually\nand promptly compensated.  Hence the necessity for some paltry\ncompromise, which has to be accepted almost as a generous\nconcession from the offender, together with the revival of private\nvengeance, and a loss of confidence in the reparatory action of\nsocial justice.\n\nEven in the scientific domain it has come about that criminal\nexperts have abandoned the question of indemnification to the\ncivil experts, and these in their turn have almost suffered it to\npass into oblivion, inasmuch as they always regarded it as\nbelonging to matters of penal law and procedure.\n\nIt is only by the radical innovation of the positive school that\nthis legal custom has received new energy and vitality.\n<p 221>\n\nI do not, however, intend in this place to concern myself with\nindemnification from the first point of view, namely, the forms of\nprocedure necessary to render it more strict and effectual, such\nas the official demand and execution by the Public Prosecutor,\neven when no action is brought by the injured party; the fixing of\nthe damages in every penal sentence; the immediate lien and claim\nupon the goods of the condemned person, so as to avoid the\npretence of inability to pay; the paying down of the sum, or a\npart of the salary or wages of solvent defendants; compulsory\nlabour by those unable to pay; the assignment of part of the\nprison wages for the benefit of the victims; the payment of all or\nmost of the damages as a necessary condition of pardon or\nconditional release; the establishment of a treasury of fines for\nprepayment to the family of the victims; the liability of the\nheirs of the condemned persons for indemnifications, and so forth.\n\nAll these propositions are in sharp contrast with Art. 37 of the\nnew Italian penal code, which has given no other guarantee to the\nvictims of offences than the superfluous, or ironical, or immoral\ndeclaration that ``penal condemnation does not prejudice the right\nof the injured person to restitution and indemnification''--as\nthough there were any doubt of the fact.\n\nI only wish to insist on the question of principle, that is, on\nthe essentially public character which we assign to\nindemnification as a social function.  For us, to compare the\nliability of the criminal to repair the loss caused by his crime\nwith the liability arising from breach of contract is simply\nimmoral.\n<p 222>\n\nCrime, just as it implies a social reaction in the form of an\nindefinite segregation of the criminal, when the act is serious\nand the author dangerous, ought also to imply a social reaction in\nthe shape of indemnification, accessory to segregation when that\nis necessary, or adequate by itself for social defence when the\nact is not serious, and the author is not dangerous.  For slight\noffences by occasional criminals, strict indemnification will, on\nthe one hand, avoid the disadvantages of short terms of\nimprisonment, and will, on the other hand, be much more\nefficacious and sensible than an assured provision of food and\nshelter, for a few days or weeks, in the State prisons.\n\nIndemnification may naturally take two forms, as a fine or an\nindemnity payable to the State, and as an indemnity or a\nreparation payable to the injured person.\n\nIt may also be added that the State should be made responsible for\nthe rights of the victims, and give them immediate satisfaction,\nespecially for crimes of violence, recouping itself from the\noffender, as it does, or ought to do, for legal costs.\n\nThe evolution of punishment is a striking proof of this.  First,\nthe reaction against crime is an entirely private concern; then it\nassumes a weaker form in pecuniary reparation, whereof, by and by,\na portion goes to the State, which presently retains the whole\nsum, leaving to the victim the poor consolation of proceeding\nseparately for an indemnification.  Nothing therefore could be\nmore in accord with this evolution of punishment than the proposed\nreform, whereby <p 223>the indemnification of a merely private\ninjury, as it is regarded in the primitive phase of penal justice,\nbecomes a public function, so far as it is the legal and social\nconsequence of the offence.\n\nThe classical principles in this respect, and the practical\nconsequences which flow from them, are more like a humorous farce\nthan an institution of justice; and it is only the force of habit\nwhich prevents the world from realising its full comicality.\n\nIn fine, citizens pay taxes in return for the public services of\nthe State, amongst which that of public security is the chief.\nAnd the State actually expends millions every year upon this\nsocial function.  Nevertheless, every crime which is committed is\nfollowed by a grotesque comedy.  The State, which is responsible\nfor not having been able to prevent crime, and to give a better\nguarantee to the citizens, arrests the criminal (if it can arrest\nhim--and seventy per cent. of _*discovered_ crimes go unpunished).\nThen, with the accused person before it, the State, ``which ought\nto concern itself with the lofty interests of eternal justice,''\ndoes not concern itself with the victims of the crime, leaving the\nindemnification to their prosaic ``private interest,'' and to a\nseparate invocation of justice.  And then the State, in the name\nof eternal justice, exacts from the criminal, in the shape of a\nfine payable into the public treasury, a compensation for its own\ndefence--which it does not secure, even when the crime is only a\ntrespass upon private property!\n\nThus the State, which cannot prevent crime, and can only repress\nit in a small number of cases, and <p 224>which fails accordingly\nin its first duty, for which the citizens pay it their taxes,\ndemands a price for all this!  And then again the State,\nsentencing a million and a half to imprisonment within ten years,\nputs the cost of food and lodging on the shoulders of the same\ncitizens, whom it has failed either to defend or to indemnify for\nthe loss which they have suffered!  And all in the name of eternal\nretributive justice.\n\nThis method of ``administering justice'' must be radically\naltered.  The State must indemnify individuals for the damage\ncaused by crimes which it has not been able to prevent (as is\npartially recognised in cases of public disaster), recouping\nitself from the criminals.\n\nOnly then shall we secure a strict reparation of damage, for the\nState will put in motion its inexorable fiscal machinery, as it\nnow does for the recovery of taxes; and on the other hand the\nprinciple of social community of interests will be really admitted\nand applied, not only against the individual but also for him.\nFor we believe that if the individual ought to be always\nresponsible for the crimes which he commits, he ought also to be\nalways indemnified for the crimes of which he is the victim.\n\nIn any case, as the indefinite segregation of the criminal is the\nfundamental principle of the positive system of social defence\nagainst crime, apart from the technical systems of imprisonment\nand detention, so indemnification as a social function is a second\nessential principle, apart from the special rules of procedure for\ncarrying it into effect.\n<p 225>\n\nThese two fundamental principles of the positive system would\nstill be incomplete if they did not come into practical operation\naccording to a general rule, which leads up to the practical\norganisation of social defence--that is to say, the adaptation of\ndefensive measures to the various criminal types.\n\nThe tendency of the classical theories on crime and prison\ndiscipline is in sharp contrast, for their ideal is the\n``uniformity of punishment'' which lies at the base of all the\nmore recent penal codes.\n\nIf for the classical school the criminal is but an average and\nabstract type, the whole difference of treatment is, of course,\nreduced to a graduation of the ``amount of crime'' and the\n``amount of punishment.''  And then it is natural that this\npunitive dosing should be more difficult when the punishments are\ndifferent in kind, and not very similar in their degrees of\ncoincident afflictive and correctional power.  Thus the ideal\nbecomes a single punishment, apportioned first by the legislature\nand then by the judge, in an indefinite number of doses.\n\nHere and there a solitary voice has been heard, even amongst the\nclassical experts, objecting to this tendency towards dogmatic\nuniformity; but it has had no influence.  The question brought\nforward by M. D'Alinge at the Prison Congress in London\n_(Proceedings_, 1872, p. 327), ``whether the moral classification\nof prisoners ought to be the main foundation of penitentiary\nsystems, either in association or on the cellular plan,'' which he\nhimself decided in the affirmative, was not so much as discussed,\nand it was not even referred to at the <p 226>successive\nCongresses at Stockholm (1878), Rome (1885), and St. Petersburg\n(1889).  On the contrary, the Congress at Stockholm decided that,\n``reserving minor and special punishments for certain slight\ninfractions of the law, or for such as do not point to the corrupt\nnature of their authors, it is desirable to adopt for every prison\nsystem the greatest possible legal assimilation of punishments by\nimprisonment, with no difference except in their duration, and the\nconsequences following upon release.''[20]\n\n\n\n[20] _Proceedings__, i. 138-70, 551-7, 561-3.  Now and then,\nhowever, a prison expert of more positive tendencies maintains\n``the very great use, or rather the scientific necessity, of the\nclassification of prisoners as a basis for the punitive and prison\nsystem'' (Beltrani Scalia.)\n\n\n\nTo positivists, the ``uniformity of punishment,'' even of mere\ndetention, appears simply absurd, since it ignores the capital\nfact of different categories of criminals.\n\nThere must be homogeneity between the evil and its remedy; for, as\nDumesnil says, ``the prisoner is a moral (I would add a physical)\npatient, more or less curable, and we must apply to him the great\nprinciples of the art of medicine.  To a diversity of ills we must\napply a diversity of remedies.''\n\nIn this connection, however, we must avoid the two extremes,\nuniformity of punishment and the so-called individualisation of\npunishment, the latter especially in fashion amongst American\nprison experts.  No doubt it would be a desirable thing to apply a\nparticular treatment to each convict, after a physical and\npsychological study of his individuality, and of the conditions\nwhich led him into crime; but this is not practicable when the\nnumber of prisoners is <p 227>very great, and the managing staff\nhave no adequate notions of criminal biology and psychology.  How\ncan a governor individualise the penal treatment of four or five\nhundred prisoners?  And does not the cellular system, which\nreduces the characteristic manifestations of the personal\ndispositions of prisoners to a minimum, levelling them all by the\nuniformity of routine and silence, render it impossible to observe\nand get to know the special character of each condemned person,\nand so specialising the discipline?  Where, too, are we to find\nthe necessary governors and warders who would know how to\ndischarge this difficult duty?  The solid fact that particular\nhouses of correction or punishment are in excellent condition when\ntheir governors have the psychological intuition of a De Metz, a\nCrofton, a Spagliardi, or a Roukawichnikoff, and languish when he\ndeparts, strikingly demonstrates that the whole secret of success\nlies in the spirit of a wise governor, skilled in psychology,\nrather than in the slender virtue of the cell.\n\nJust as an imperfect code with good judges succeeds better than a\n``monumental'' code with foolish judges, so a prison system,\nhowever ingenious and symmetrical, is worthless without a staff to\ncorrespond.\n\nAnd as the question of the staff is always very serious,\nespecially for financial reasons, I believe that, instead of the\nimpracticable idea of individualisation in punishment, we ought to\nsubstitute that of classification, which is equally efficacious\nand more easily applied.  It cannot be denied that criminal\nanthropologists are not all agreed on the classification of\n<p 228>criminals.  But I have already shown that the differences\nbetween proposed classifications are only formal and of secondary\nimportance; and again, the number of those who agree to the\nclassification which I have proposed increases day by day.\n\nBefore inquiring how we can practically organise the positive\nsystem of social defence on the basis of this anthropological\nclassification of criminals, we must bear in mind two rules,\ncommon to all the technical proposals of the same system.\n\nFirst, care must be taken that segregation does not become or\ncontinue to be (as it is too often at present) a welcome refuge of\nidleness and criminal association, instead of a deprivation.\n\nPenitentiaries for condemned prisoners--the classical prison\nexperts make no distinction between their cells for prisoners\nbefore trial and those for convicts!--should not be so comfortable\nas to excite the envy (a vast injustice and imprudence) of the\nhonest and ill-fed rural labourer vegetating in his cottage, or of\nthe working-man pining in his garret.\n\nSecondly, the obligation to labour should be imperative for all\nwho are in prison, except in case of sickness.  Prisoners should\npay the State, not as now for their tobacco and wine, but for\nfood, clothes, and lodging, whilst the remainder of their earnings\nshould go to indemnify their victims.\n\nThe classical theory declares that ``the State,'' as Pessina\nwrites, ``being compelled to adopt deprivation of liberty as the\nprincipal means of penal repression and retribution, contracts an\nabsolute <p 229>obligation to provide those whom they punish in\nthis way not only with bodily sustenance, but also with the means\nof supplying their intellectual and moral needs.''  So the State\nmaintains in idleness the majority even of those who are said to\nbe ``sentenced to hard labour,'' and the offence, after it has\nserved the turn of the offender, further assures him free lodging\nand food, shifting the burden on to honest citizens.\n\nI cannot see by what moral or legal right the crime ought to\nexempt the criminal from the daily necessity of providing for his\nown subsistence, which he experienced before he committed the\ncrime, and which all honest men undergo with so many sacrifices.\nThe irony of these consequences of the classical theories could\nnot, in fact, be more remarkable.  So long as a man remains\nhonest, in spite of pathetic misery and sorrow, the State takes no\ntrouble to guarantee for him the means of existence by his labour.\nIt even bans those who have the audacity to remind society that\nevery man, by the mere fact of living, has the right to live, and\nthat, as work is the only means of obtaining a livelihood, every\nman has the right (as all should recognise the duty) of working in\norder to live.\n\nBut as soon as any one commits a crime, the State considers it its\nduty to take the utmost care of him, ensuring for him comfortable\nlodging, plenty of food, and light labour, if it does not grant\nhim a happy idleness!  And all this, again, in the name of eternal\nand retributive justice.\n\nIt may be added that our proposals are the only <p 230>way of\nsettling the oft-recurring question as to the economic competition\n(by the price of commodities), and the moral competition (in the\nregularity of work) which prison labour unjustly wages with free\nand honest labour.  As a matter of fact, as prisoners can only\nremain idle or work, they must clearly be made to work.  But they\nmust be made to work at trades which come less into competition\nwith free labour and it is especially necessary to give prisoners\nwages equal to those of free labourers, on condition that they pay\nthe State for their food, clothes, and lodging, whilst the\nremainder goes to indemnify their victims.\n\nOver the prison gates I should like to carve that maxim of\nuniversal application:  ``He who will not work, neither shall he\neat.''\n\n\n\nV.\n\nSince the novel proposals put forward half a century ago, amongst\nothers by doctors Georget and Brierre de Boismont, a whole library\nof volumes has been published in favour of criminal lunatic\nasylums.  A few voices here and there were heard in opposition or\nreserve, but these have almost entirely ceased.\n\nCriminal lunatic asylums were adopted in England as early as 1786.\nIn 1815 Bethlehem Hospital was appropriated to criminal lunatics,\nand the Broadmoor Asylum was founded in 1863.  Similar asylums\nexist at Dundrum in Ireland (1850), at Perth in Scotland (1858),\nat New York (1874), and in Canada (1877).\n\nOn the continent of Europe there is not to this day a regular\nasylum for mad criminals, though France, <p 231>after an\nexperiment in treating condemned madmen at Bic<e^>tre, opened a\nseparate wing for them in the prison at Gaillon.  Holland has\nassigned to them the hospital of Bosmalen (Brabant); Germany has\nspecial wards in the establishments at Waldheim, Bruchsaal, Halle,\nand Hamburg; and Italy, after founding a special ward in 1876, at\nthe establishment for relapsed prisoners at Aversa, has converted\nthe Ambrogiana establishment at Montelupo in Tuscany, into an\nasylum for insane convicts, and for prisoners under observation as\nbeing of unsound mind.  The new Italian penal code, though not\nopenly recognising the foundation of asylums for criminals\nacquitted on the ground of insanity, has, in its general spirit of\neclecticism, given judges the power of handing them over to the\ncompetent authority when it would be dangerous to release them\n(Art. 46).  At the Montelupo Asylum criminals acquitted on the\nground of insanity are also detained, at first under observation,\nthen by a definite order from the president of the Tribunal, who\ncan revoke his order on the petition of the family, or of the\nauthorities.\n\nThe inquiry into existing legislation on insane criminals,\nundertaken by the ``Soci<e'>t<e'> G<e'>n<e'>rale des prisons de\nParis,'' showed that in France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Croatia,\nBelgium, Portugal, and Sweden, the authors of crimes or offences\nwho are acquitted on the ground of insanity are withdrawn from all\ncontrol by the judicial authority, and entrusted to the more or\nless regular and effectual control of the administrative\nauthority.  In England, <p 232>Holland, Denmark, Spain, and\nRussia, on the contrary, the judicial authority is empowered and\neven compelled to order the seclusion of these individuals in an\nordinary or a criminal lunatic asylum.\n\n\nOf the objections raised against this form of social defence\nagainst insane criminals, I pass over that of the cost, which is\nconsiderable; for even from the financial point of view I believe\nthat the actual system, which gives no guarantee of security\nagainst madmen with criminal tendencies, is more costly to the\nadministration, if only by reason of the damage which they cause.\nI also pass over the other objection, based on the violent scenes\nwhich are said to be inseparable from the association of such\nprisoners; for experience has shown that forebodings are ill\nfounded in regard to criminal asylums where the inmates are\nclassified according to their tendencies, under the direction of a\nstaff with special knowledge, who are able to prevent such\noutbreaks.  In ordinary asylums, on the other hand, a few insane\ncriminals are sufficient to render the maintenance of order very\ndifficult, and their inevitable and frequent outbreaks have dire\neffects on the other patients.\n\nThe most serious and repeated difficulties in regard to lunatic\nasylums spring from the very principles of the defensive function\nof society.\n\nIt is said in the first place that the author of a dangerous\naction is either a madman or else a criminal.  If he is a madman,\nhe has nothing to do with penal justice--so Fabret, Mendel, and\nothers have said; his action is not a crime, for he had no\n<p 233>control over himself, and he ought to go to an ordinary\nasylum, special measures being taken for him, as for every other\ndangerous madman.  Or else he is a criminal, and then he has\nnothing to do with a lunatic asylum, and he ought to go to prison.\n\nBut there is a fallacy in this dilemma, for it leaves out the\nintermediate cases and types, where particular individuals are at\nthe same time mad and criminal.  And even if it were a question of\nmadmen only, the logical consequence would not be to bar out\nspecial asylums, for it seems clear that if ordinary madmen (not\ncriminals, that is, not the authors of dangerous actions) ought to\ngo to an ordinary asylum, criminal madmen, or madmen with a\ntendency to commit dangerous or criminal actions, as well as those\nwho have committed them, ought to go to a special asylum for this\ncategory of madmen.  For, on the other hand, we constantly see\nthat administrative authorities which observe the same rules for\nthe seclusion of ordinary and criminal madmen do not prevent the\nrelease of the latter, some time after the crime, when the\ndisturbance of mind and even the recollection of the deed are all\nbut effaced; and criminal madmen commit other violent or\noutrageous excesses, very soon after they are left exposed to\ntheir diseased tendencies.[21]\n\n\n\n[21] M. Lunier, writing in 1881 of epileptics, and the method of\ntreatment and aid appropriate to them, says that of 33,000 known\nepileptics in France, 5,200 only are in private or public asylums,\nwhilst 28,000 remain with their families.  From these figures it\nwould appear very probable that these 28,000 epileptics left at\nliberty commit crimes and offences.\n\n\nIt may be answered that it is sufficient to have <p 234>special\nwings in ordinary asylums, which would also get over the\nrepugnance of families against the association of their quiet and\nharmless patients with murderous and outrageous madmen.  But\nexperience has already proved that these special wards do not work\nwell, for it is too difficult with the same staff to apply such\nvaried treatment and discipline as are necessary for ordinary and\ncriminal lunatics.\n\nFabret says that ``a so-called criminal, when he is seen to be\nmad, should cease to be regarded as a criminal, and ought purely\nand simply to resume his ordinary rights.''\n\nBut, in the first place, if a madman is distinguished from all\nother inoffensive madmen by the grave fact of having killed, or\nburned, or outraged, it is clear that he cannot ``purely and\nsimply'' return to the same kind of treatment which is given to\nharmless lunatics.\n\nThe truth is that this argument applies to a large number of ideas\nwhich science is continually weeding out, and which have proceeded\non the assumption that madness is an involuntary misfortune which\nmust be treated, and that crime is a voluntary fault which must be\nchastised.  It is evident on the other hand that crime as well as\nfolly, being the result of abnormal conditions of the individual,\nand of the physical and social environment, is always a question\nfor social defence, whether it is or is not accompanied in the\ncriminal by a more or less manifest and clinical form of mental\nmalady.\n\nThe same reply holds good for the second objection to asylums for\ncriminal madmen, when it is said that <p 235>a madman cannot, for\nthe sole reason that he has killed or stolen, be shut up\nindefinitely, perhaps for ever, in an asylum.\n\nMancini, who was keeper of the seals, and at the same time a great\ncriminal pleader, aptly expressed the ideas of the classical\nschool when replying to an interpellation of Deputy Righi on the\nfoundation of criminal lunatic asylums:--``I could never\nunderstand how the same court, which is obliged by law to acquit\nupon a verdict of the jury that the accused is insane, and\ntherefore not responsible, could also decree the compulsory\nseclusion in an asylum, for any period, of the same accused\nperson. . . .  Is it because he has committed a crime?  But that\nis not true, for the man who did not know what he was doing, and\nwho for that reason has been declared innocent before the law, and\nirresponsible, cannot have committed a crime.  There is\nconsequently no legal reason why he should lose the exercise and\nenjoyment of that liberty which is not denied to any other\nunfortunate beings who are diseased like himself.''\n\nIt would be impossible to put more clearly the pure classical\ntheory on crime and punishment; but perhaps it would be equally\nimpossible to show less solicitude for social defence against\ncriminal attacks.  For it is certain that the mad murderer ``has\ncommitted no crime'' from the ethical and legal point of view of\nthe classical school; but it is still more certain that there is a\ndead man, and a family left behind who may be ruined by the deed,\nand it is very probable that this homicide, ``innocent before the\nlaw,'' <p 236>will renew his outrage on other victims--and at any\nrate they are innocent.\n\nAnd as for the indefinite period of seclusion in an asylum, it is\nwell to remember, from the point of view of individual rights,\nthat the formula with which a mad criminal is committed to an\nasylum ``during her Majesty's pleasure'' had its origin in\nEngland, in the classic land of the _habeas corpus_--the sheet\nanchor of the ordinary citizen.  Again, it is easy to see that the\nindefinite seclusion of mad criminals is rendered necessary by the\nsame reasons which create the fundamental rule for criminals of\nevery kind.  It may therefore come to a question of allowing or\ndisallowing the general principles of the positive school.  But it\ncannot be denied that they are unassailable, both in theory and in\npractice.  Crime is a phenomenon as natural as madness--the\nexistence of society compels the organised community to defend\nitself against every anti-social action of the individual--the\nonly difficulty is to adapt the form and duration of this self-\ndefence to the form and intensity (the motives, conditions, and\nconsequences) of the action.  Indefinite seclusion, therefore, in\na special establishment is inevitable on account of the special\ncondition of these individuals.\n\nThe practical considerations of social defence are so strong that\nthe great majority of classical criminal experts now accept\ncriminal lunatic asylums, in spite of their manifest contradiction\nof the formal theories of moral responsibility, on the strength of\nwhich these asylums were, and still are, opposed by the\nintransigents of the classical school.  This is why the new\n<p 237>Italian penal code, in spite of its progressive aim, had\nnot the courage in 1889 to adopt them frankly; and in the\ndefinitive text, as in the ministerial draft, it took refuge in an\neclectic arrangement which has already met with a crowd of\nobstacles, due to the vagueness of the principles inspiring the\ncode.\n\nThese criminal lunatic asylums ought to be of two kinds, differing\nin their discipline, one for the insane authors of serious and\ndangerous crimes, such as homicide, incendiarism, rape, and the\nlike; and the other for slighter crimes, such as petty theft,\nviolent language, outrages on public decency, and the like.  For\nthe latter, seclusion should be shorter than for the others.  Thus\nin England convicts are sent to the State Asylum at Broadmoor,\nwhilst minor offenders are sent to a county asylum.\n\nPersons thus confined should be (1) prisoners acquitted on the\nground of insanity, or sentenced for a fixed period, at the\npreliminary inquiry; (2) convicts who become insane during the\nexpiation of their sentence; (3) insane persons who commit crimes\nin the ordinary asylums; (4) persons under observation for weak\nintellect in special wards, who have been put on their trial, and\ngiven grounds for suspecting madness.\n\nAt Broadmoor, on December 31, 1867, there were 389 male patients\nand 126 female; and in 1883 there were 381 males and 132 females,\nthus classified:--\n\n    Mad Criminals.

For whilst the classical abolitionists\nalmost all assert that the death penalty is inequitable, the\npositivists are unanimous in declaring it legitimate, and only a\nfew contest its practical efficacy.\n\nIt seems to me that the death penalty is prescribed by nature, and\noperates at every moment in the life of the universe.  Nor is it\nopposed to justice, for when the death of another man is\nabsolutely necessary it is legitimate, as in the cases of lawful\nself-<p 240>defence, whether of the individual or of society,\nwhich is admitted by classical abolitionists such as Beccaria and\nCarrara.\n\nThe universal law of evolution shows us also that vital progress\nof every kind is due to continual selection, by the death of the\nleast fit in the struggle for life.  Now this selection, in\nhumanity as with the lower animals, may be natural or artificial.\nIt would therefore be in agreement with natural laws that human\nsociety should make an artificial selection, by the elimination of\nanti-social and incongruous individuals.\n\nWe ought not, however, to carry these conclusions too far, for\nevery problem has its relative bearings, and positive observation,\nunlike logic, does not admit simple and exact solutions.  It must\nbe observed that this idea of artificial selection, though true,\nwould lead to exaggerated conclusions, if it were carried into the\nsociological field without reserve, and without the necessary\nbalance between the interests and rights of the community and of\nindividuals.  If this idea were taken absolutely, indeed, it would\nrender legitimate and even obligatory an ultra-Spartan elimination\nof all children born abortive or incurably diseased, or anti-\nsocial through their idiotcy or mental insanity.\n\nOn the other hand, to recognise that the death penalty may be\nlegitimate as an extreme and exceptional measure is not to\nacknowledge that it is necessary in the normal conditions of\nsocial life.  Now it cannot be questioned that in these normal\nconditions society may defend itself otherwise than by death, as\n<p 241>by perpetual seclusion or transportation, the failure of\nwhich, by the escape of convicts, is too rare to be decisive\nagainst it.\n\nThe preventive and deterrent efficacy of the death penalty is very\nproblematical when we examine it not by our own impressions as\naverage human beings, calmly and theoretically, but with the data\nof criminal psychology, which is its only true sphere of\nobservation.  Every one who commits a crime is either carried away\nby sudden passion, when he thinks of nothing, or else he acts\ncoolly and with premeditation, and then he is determined in his\naction, not by a dubious comparison between the death penalty and\nimprisonment for life, but simply by a hope of impunity.  This is\nespecially the case with born criminals, whose main psychological\ncharacteristic is an excess of improvidence, combined with moral\ninsensibility.\n\nIf a convict tells us that he fears death, this merely means that\nhe has the momentary impression, which cannot, however, restrain\nhim from crime, for here again, by the same psychological\ntendency, he will be subject only to the criminal temptation.\n\nAnd if it is true that, when the criminal has been tried and\ncondemned, he fears death more than imprisonment for life (always\nexcepting condemned suicides, and those who by their physical and\nmoral insensibility laugh at death up to the foot of the\nscaffold), it is none the less necessary to try and to condemn\nthem.\n\nIndeed statistics prove that the periodic variations of the more\nserious crimes is independent of the <p 242>number of\ncondemnations and executions, for they are determined by very\ndifferent causes.  Tuscany, where there has been no death penalty\nfor a century, is one of the provinces with the lowest number of\nserious crimes; and in France, in spite of the increase of general\ncrime and of population, charges of murder, poisoning, parricide,\nand homicide, dropped from 560 in 1826 to 430 in 1888, though the\nnumber of executions diminished in the same period from 197 to 9.\n\nThe death penalty is an easy panacea, but it is far from being\ncapable of solving a problem so complex as that of serious crime.\nThe idea of killing off the incorrigibles and the born criminals\nis easily conceived, and Diderot, in his Letter to Landois,\nmaintained that it was a natural consequence of the denial of\nfree-will, saying:  ``What is the grand distinction between man\nand man?  Doing good and doing harm.  The man who does harm ought\nto be extinguished, not punished.''  But as against this too\nfacile notion we must look to experience, and to the other\nmaterial and moral conditions of social life, for the necessary\nbalance and completion.\n\nI will not further discuss the death penalty, for it is by this\ntime an exhausted question from the intellectual standpoint, and\nhas passed into the domain of prejudice for or against, and this\nprejudice is concerned rather with the more or less repugnant\nmethod of execution than with the penalty itself.  In its favour\nthere is the absolute, irrevocable, and instantaneous elimination\nfrom society of an individual who has shown himself absolutely\nunadaptable, and dangerous to society.  But I hold that, if we\nwould <p 243>draw from the death penalty the only positive utility\nwhich it possesses, namely, artificial selection, then we must\nhave courage enough to apply it resolutely in all cases where it\nis necessary from this point of view, that is to say, to all born\ncriminals, who are the authors of the most serious crimes of\nviolence.  In Italy, for example, it would be necessary to execute\nat least one thousand persons every year, and in France nearly two\nhundred and fifty, in place of the annual seven or eight.\n\nOtherwise the death penalty must be considered as an unserviceable\nand neglected means of terror, merely to be printed in the codes;\nand in that case it would be acting more seriously to abolish it.\n\nSo regarded it is too much like those motionless scarecrows which\nhusbandmen set up in their fields, dotted about with the foolish\nnotion that the birds will be frightened away from the corn.  They\nmay cause a little alarm at first sight; but by and by the birds,\nseeing that the scarecrow never moves and cannot hurt them, lose\ntheir fear, and even perch on the top of it.  So it is with\ncriminals when they see that the death penalty is never or very\nrarely applied; and one cannot doubt that criminals judge of the\nlaw, not by its formulation in the codes, but by its practical and\ndaily application.\n\nSince the deterrent efficacy of punishments in general, including\nthe death penalty, is quite insignificant for the born criminals,\nwho are insensible and improvident, the rare cases of execution\nwill certainly not cure the disease of society.  Only the\nslaughter of several hundred murderers every year would have\n<p 244>a sensible result in the way of artificial selection; but\nthat is more easily said than done.  And I imagine that, at normal\nperiods, in no modern and civilised State would a series of daily\nexecutions of the capital sentence be possible.  Public opinion\nwould not endure it, and a reaction would soon set in.[22]\n\n\n\n[22] In every case I think that executions should take place in\nprison, and by means of a poison administered as soon as the\nsentence takes effect.  In North America electricity has been\ntried, but executions by this process appear to be as horrible and\nrepulsive as those by the guillotine, the garotte, the scaffold,\nor the rifle.  (See the _Medico-Legal Journal_ of New York, March\nand September, 1889.) From the ``Summarised Information on Capital\nPunishment,'' published by the Howard Association in 1881, I take\nthe following figures on capital punishment in Europe and\nAmerica:--\n\n\n                                Death\n        State.                  Sentences.  Executions.\nAustria (1870-9)    ... ... ... ... ... 806 ... 16\nFrance (1870-9) ... ... ... ... ... 198 ... 93\nSpain (1868-77) ... ... ... ... ... 291 ... 26\nSweden (1869-78)    ... ... ... ... ... 32  ... 3\nDenmark (1868-77)   ... ... ... ... ... 94  ... 1\nBavaria (1870-9)    ... ... ... ... ... 240 ... 7\nItaly (1867-76) ... ... ... ... ... 392 ... 34\nGermany, North (1869-78)    ... ... ... 484 ... 1\nEngland (1860 79)   ... ... ... ... ... 665 ... 372\nIreland (1860-79)   ... ... ... ... ... 66  ... 36\nScotland (1860-79)  ... ... ... ... ... 40  ... 15\nAustralia and New Zealand (1870-9)  ... 453 ... 123\nUnited States, about 2,500 murders annually--about 100\nexecutions and 100 lynchings annually.\n\n\n\nIn Finland, between 1824 and 1880 there was no execution.  In\nHolland, Portugal, Roumania, and Italy, capital punishment is\nabolished by law; and in Belgium virtually.  Switzerland also has\nabolished it, but a few cantons, under the influence of a few\natrocious and recurrent crimes, revived it in their codes, but did\nnot carry it out.  In the United States it has been abolished in\nMichigan, Wisconsin, Rhode Island, and Maine.  An inquiry into the\nlegislation and statistics relating to murder in Europe and\nAmerica was instituted by Lord Granville in July, 1880 and the\nresults were published in 1881.  (``Reports on the Laws of Foreign\nCountries respecting Homicidal Crime.'')\n\n\n\nIn a manuscript register of executions in the Duchy of Ferrara\nbetween 970 and 1870, I found that, excluding the nineteenth\ncentury, there were 5,627 <p 245>executions in 800 years (3,981\nfor theft, and 1,009 for homicide), that is an average of 700 in\neach century, in the city of Ferrara alone.  And at Rome,\naccording to the records of the Convent of St. John the Beheaded,\nbetween 1500 and 1770 there were 5,280 executions, or 1,955 in\neach century, in the city of Rome alone.  Now, if we consider the\nproportion of population in Ferrara and Rome to that of Italy as a\nwhole, we reach an enormous number of executions in former\ncenturies, which can scarcely have been fewer than four hundred\nevery year.\n\nThese were serious applications of the death penalty, to which we\ncertainly owe in some degree the purification of society by the\nelimination of individuals who would otherwise have swelled their\ncriminal posterity.\n\nIn conclusion, if we wish to treat the death penalty seriously,\nand derive from it the only service of which it is capable, we\nmust apply it on this enormous scale; or else, if it is retained\nas an ineffectual terror, we should be acting more seriously if we\nwere to expunge it from the penal code, after excluding it from\nour ordinary practice.  And as I shall certainly not have the\ncourage to ask for the restoration of these medi<ae>val modes of\nextermination, I am still, for the practical considerations above\nmentioned, a convinced abolitionist, especially for such countries\nas Italy, where a more or less artificial and superficial current\nof public opinion is keenly opposed to capital punishment.\n\n\nSetting aside the death penalty, as unnecessary in <p 246>normal\ntimes, and inapplicable in the only proportions which would make\nit efficacious, for the born criminals who commit the most serious\ncrimes, there remains only a choice between these two modes of\nelimination--transportation for life and indefinite seclusion.\n\nThis is the only choice for the positivists; for we cannot attach\nmuch importance to the opinion of the German jurists,\nHoltzendorff, Geyer, and others, who would do away with perpetual\nimprisonment altogether.  Professor Lucchini took up this theory\nin Italy, saying that the personal freedom of the convict ought to\nbe limited in its exercise, but not suppressed as a right, and\nthat imprisonment for life destroys ``the moral and legal\npersonality of the criminal in one of its most important human\nfactors, the sociable instinct.''  He added that punishment\n``ought not to become exhausted by excess of duration.''\n\nSurely it is not speaking seriously to say that the right of the\nindividual cannot be suppressed if necessity demands it, when we\nsee it done every day in cases of legitimate self-defence; and\nthat punishment is exhausted by excess of duration, when it is\nprecisely the duration of banishment from one's kind which\nconstitutes the only real efficacy of punishment; and to speak of\nthe sociable instinct in connection with the most anti-social\ncriminals.\n\nAnd it is only by oblivion of the elementary and least contestable\ndata of criminal bio-psychology that the exclusion of all life-\npunishments can be maintained, on the ground that this perpetuity\n``is contrary to the reformative principle of punishment, to the\nprinciple that punishment ought to aim not only at\n<p 247>afflicting the prisoner, but also at arousing in him, if\npossible, the moral sense, or at strengthening him, and opening up\nto him a path by which he can hope to be readmitted into society,\namended and rehabilitated.  Perpetuity of punishment excludes this\npossibility.''\n\nThe framers of the Dutch penal code replied to these observations\nof Professor Pols, first in the name of common sense, that\n``punishment is not inflicted for the benefit of the prisoner, but\nfor that of society,'' and secondly, with something of irony, that\n``even for the sake of the abolition of capital punishment, and to\nprevent a reaction in favour of this punishment, we must uphold\nthe right of shutting up for ever the few malefactors whose\nrelease would be dangerous.''\n\nIt is entirely futile to consider the amendment of criminals as\nopposed to imprisonment for life, when it is known that born\ncriminals, authors of the most serious crimes, for whom such\npunishment is reserved, are precisely those whose amendment is\nimpossible, and that the moral sense attributed to them is only a\npsychological fallacy of the classical psychologist, who\nattributes to the conscience of the criminal that which he feels\nin his own honest and normal conscience.\n\nBut it is easy enough to see that this opposition to perpetual\ndetention, though it has remained without effect, as being too\ndoctrinaire and sentimental, is only a symptom of the historical\ntendency of the classical schools, entirely in favour of the\ncriminal, and always tending to the relaxation of punishments.\nThe interests of society are too much disregarded <p 248>when it\nis sought to pass from the abolition of capital punishment to that\nof imprisonment for life.  If the tendency is not checked, we may\nexpect to see some classical expert demanding the abolition of all\npunishment for these unfortunate criminals, with their delicate\nmoral sensibilities!\n\nThe question, therefore, is between transportation or indefinite\nseclusion.\n\nMuch has been written for and against transportation, and there\nwas a lively discussion of the problem in Italy, some twenty years\nago, between M. Beltrani Scalia, a former director-general of\nprisons, and the advocates of this form of elimination of\ncriminals.  Without going into the details of the controversy, it\nis evident that the experience of countries like England, which\nfor a long time transported its criminals at a cost of hundreds of\nmillions, and then abandoned the practice, is in itself a\nnoteworthy example.\n\nYet it is only an objection, so far as it goes, against\ntransportation as formerly practised, that is to say, with\nenormous prisons built in distant lands.  M. Beltrani Scalia\njustly said that we might as well build them at home, for they\nwill cost less and be more serviceable.  The example of France in\nits practical application of this policy is not encouraging.\n\nHowever, there is in transportation, as in the death penalty, an\nunquestionable element of reason.  For when it is perpetual, with\nvery faint chances of return, it is the best mode of ridding\nsociety of its most injurious factors, without our being compelled\nto keep them in those compulsory human hives which are known as\ncellular prisons.\n<p 249>\n\nBut again, there is the question of simple transportation, first\nput into practice by England, which consists of planting convicts\non an island or desert continent, with the opportunity of living\nby labour, or else of letting them loose in a savage country,\nwhere the convicts, who in civilised countries are themselves half\nsavage, would represent a partial civilisation, and, from being\nhighwaymen and murderers, might become military leaders in\ncountries where, at any rate, the revival of their criminal\ntendencies would meet with an immediate and energetic resistance,\nin place of the slow machinery of our criminal trials.\n\nFor Italy, however, the question presents itself in a special\nform; for there a sort of internal deportation, in the lands which\nare not tilled on account of the malaria, would be far more\nserviceable.  If the dispersion of this malaria demands a human\nhecatomb, it would evidently be better to sacrifice criminals than\nhonest husbandmen.  Transportation across the sea was very\ndifficult for Italy a few years ago, especially in view of the\nlack of colonies; for then there was always the obstacle of which\nFranklin spoke in reference to transported English convicts, in\nhis well-known retort:  ``What would you say if we were to\ntransport our rattlesnakes to England?''  But since Italy has had\nher colony of Erythrea the idea of transportation has been taken\nup again.  In May, 1890, I brought forward a resolution in\nParliament in favour of an experimental penal colony in our\nAfrican dependencies.  The proposal found many supporters, in\nspite of the opposition of the keeper of the seals, who forgot\nthat he had written in his report <p 250>on the draft penal code\nthat prisoners might also be detained in the colonies.  Soon\nafterwards the proposal was renewed by Deputy De Zerbi, and\naccepted by M. Beltrani Scalia, director-general of prisons.\n\nIn a similar manner M. Prins declares himself in favour of\ntransportation for Belgium, since the constitution of the Congo\nState.\n\nBut it is my matured opinion that transportation ought not to be\nan end in itself.  The penal colony for adults ought to be a\npioneer of the free agricultural colony.  The problem of a penal\ncolony in our African possessions cannot, therefore, be solved in\nadvance of two other questions.\n\nBefore all, we must see whether these possessions offer suitable\ndistricts for agricultural colonisation.  And secondly, we must\nconsider whether convicts would not cost less to transport into\ndistricts nearer home which need to be cleared, a plan which would\nalso prevent their going over to the enemy, becoming leaders or\nguides of the barbarous tribes which are at war with us.\n\nIn any case, whether we decide on transportation to the interior\nor beyond the seas, for born and habitual criminals, there is\nstill the question as to the form of seclusion.\n\nIn this connection the idea has been suggested of ``establishments\nfor incorrigibles,'' or hardened criminals, wherein should be\nconfined for life, or (the same thing in this case) for an\nindefinite period, born criminals who have committed serious\ncrimes, habitual criminals, and confirmed recidivists.\n<p 251>\n\nThe congenital character and hereditary transmission of criminal\ntendencies in these individuals fully justify the words of\nQuetelet, that ``moral diseases are like physical diseases: they\nare contagious, or epidemic, or hereditary.  Vice is transmitted\nin some families in the same way as scrofula or consumption.  The\ngreater number of crimes come from a comparatively few families,\nwhich need a special supervision, an isolation like that which we\nimpose on sick persons suspected of carrying the germs of\ninfection.''  So Aristotle speaks of a man who, being accused of\nbeating his father, answered:  ``My father beat my grandfather,\nwho used to beat his father cruelly; and you see my son--before he\nis grown up he will fly into passions and beat me.''  And Plutarch\nadded to this:  ``The sons of vicious and corrupt men reproduce\nthe very nature of their parents.''\n\nThis is the explanation of Plato's idea, who, ``admitting the\nprinciple that children ought not to suffer for the crimes of\ntheir parents, yet, putting the case of a father, a grandfather,\nand a great-grandfather who had been condemned to death, proposed\nthat their descendants should be banished, as belonging to an\nincorrigible family.''  Carrara called this a mistaken idea, but\nit seems to us to be substantially just.  It may be remembered\nthat when De Metz in 1839 founded his agricultural penal colony at\nMetray, once celebrated but now in decay (for the whole success of\nthese foundations depends on the exceptional psychological\nqualities of their governors), out of 4,454 children, 871, or 20\nper cent., were the children of convicts.  We quite agree with\nCrofton's proposal to <p 252>place the children of convicts in\nindustrial schools or houses of correction.\n\nA special establishment for the perpetual or indefinite seclusion\nof incorrigible criminals has been proposed or approved in Italy\nby Lombroso, Curcio, Barini, Doria, Tamassia, Garofalo, Carelli;\nin France by Despine, Labatiste, Tissot, Leveill<e'>; in Russia by\nMinzloff; in England by May; in Germany by Kraepelin and\nLilienthal; in Austria by Wahlberg; in Switzerland by Guillaume;\nin America by Wines and Wayland; in Holland by Van Hamel; in\nPortugal by Lucas; &c.\n\nBut I believe that, in order to establish the fact of\nincorrigibility, the number of relapses should vary in regard to\ndifferent criminals and crimes.  Thus, for instance, in the case\nof murders, especially by born criminals, the first crime should\nlead to an order for imprisonment for life.  In the case of less\nserious crimes, such as rape, theft, wounding, swindling, &c.,\nfrom two to four relapses should be necessary before the habitual\ncriminal is sentenced to such imprisonment.\n\nThese ideas are approximately carried out, especially in the\ncountries which, having made no great advance in the criminal\nsciences, meet with less of pedantic opposition to practical\nreforms.\n\nThus we find that France, after the proposals of Michaux, Petit,\nand Migneret, and especially after the advocacy of M. Reinach,\nfollowed by several publications of a like kind, agreed to the law\nof 1885 on the treatment of recidivism.\n\nMessrs. Murray Brown and Baker spoke at the <p 253>Prison Congress\nat Stockholm and at the Soci<e'>t<e'> G<e'>n<e'>rale des Prisons\nat Paris, of the system of cumulative and progressive sentences\nadopted, though not universally, in England with respect to\nhardened criminals.  The term of imprisonment is increased, almost\nregularly, on each new relapse.  This is the system which had\nalready been suggested by Field and Walton Pearson at the Social\nScience Congress in October, 1871, and subsequently by Cox and\nCall, who was head of the police at Glasgow, at the Congress of\n1874, and which, as Mr. Movatt pointed out, was adopted in the\nIndian penal code, and had been established in Japan by a decree\nfixing perpetual imprisonment after the fourth relapse.\n\nThe delegate from Canada at the Prison Congress at Stockholm\ntestified that short terms of imprisonment increased the number of\noffences.  ``After a first sentence many offenders in this class\nbecome professional criminals.  Professional thieves, who are\nhabitual offenders, ought, with few exceptions, to be sentenced to\nimprisonment for life, or for a term equivalent to the probable\nremainder of their life.''  The draft Russian code, in 1883,\nprovides that, ``If it is found that the accused is guilty of\nseveral offences, and that he has committed them through habitual\ncriminality, or as a profession, the court, when deciding upon the\npunishment in relation to the different crimes, may increase it,''\n&c.  And the Italian penal code, though with much timidity, has\ndecreed a special increase of punishment for prisoners ``who have\nrelapsed several times.''\n<p 254>\n\nQuite recently, Senator B<e'>renger introduced a measure in France\n``on the progressive increase of punishment in cases of relapse,''\nwhich became law on March 26, 1891, under the title of ``the\nmodification and increase of punishments.''\n\nIt is therefore very probable that even the classical criminalists\nwill end by accepting the indefinite seclusion of hardened\ncriminals, as they have already come to accept criminal lunatic\nasylums, though both ideas are opposed to the classical theories.\n\nThis is so true that at the Prison Congress at St. Petersburg in\n1889 the question was first propounded ``whether it can be\nadmitted that certain criminals should be regarded as\nincorrigible, and, if so, what means could be employed to protect\nsociety against this class of convicts.''  And speaking as a\ndelegate from the Law Society of St. Petersburg, M. Spasovitch\nacknowledged that ``this question bore the stamp of its origin on\nits face.  Of all the questions in the programme, it seemed to be\nthe only one directly inspired by the principles of the new\npositive school of criminal anthropology, whose theories,\npropagated beyond the land of their birth in Italy, tended to a\nradical reform in science as well as in legislation, in the penal\nlaw as well as in procedure, in ideas of crime as well as in the\nmodes of repression.''\n\nThe Congress, in spite of some expressions of reserve, as when\nMadame Arenal platonically observed that ``an uncorrected criminal\nis not synonymous with an incorrigible criminal,'' adopted the\nfollowing resolution:--``Without admitting that from <p 255>the\npenal and penitentiary point of view there are any absolutely\nincorrigible criminals''--which is pure pedantry--``yet since\nexperience shows that there are in fact individuals who resist the\ncombined action of punishment and imprisonment''--a notable\nadmission!--``and who habitually and almost professionally renew\ntheir violation of the laws of society, this section of the\nCongress is unanimously of opinion that it is necessary to adopt\nspecial measures against such individuals.''\n\nSimilarly the International Union of Penal Law, in its session at\nBerne (August, 1890), expressed the opinions of the majority in\nthe following terms:--``There are malefactors for whom, in view of\ntheir physical and moral condition, the constant application of\nordinary punishments is inadequate.  In this class are specially\nincluded the hardened recidivists, who ought to be considered as\ndegenerate criminals, or criminals by profession.  Malefactors\nought to be subjected, according to the degree of their\ndegeneration, or of the danger which they threaten, to special\nmeasures, framed with the purpose of preventing them from\ninflicting harm, and of amending them if possible.''  And in the\nsession at Christiania (August, 1891), after the remarkable\ncontribution of Van Hamel, the Union, after rejecting the\nproposition of Felisch, which spoke of ``the uncorrected'' in\nplace of the ``incorrigible,'' unanimously approved the\nconclusions of Van Hamel:--``With a view to the more complete\nstudy of the character and injurious influence of habitual\noffenders, notably of such as are incorrigible (a study which is\nabsolutely indis<p 256>pensable for legislation), the Union\ninstructs its officers to urge upon the various Governments the\ngreat importance of statistics of recidivism which shall be\ndetailed, precise, uniform, and adapted for comparative study.\nFor incorrigible habitual offenders it is absolutely necessary\nthat the trial on the last charge shall not definitely determine\nthe treatment of the offender, but that the decision shall be\ncarried on to a further inquiry, which shall have regard to the\noffender personally, to his past, and to his conduct during a\nfixed period of observation.\n\n\nIt is now necessary to inquire what form the perpetual or\nindefinite segregation of the criminal should assume.\n\nTwo great innovations in regard to prisons, as M. Tarde observes,\nhave been made or developed within the past century, which are not\nyet adopted in every country: penal colonies, whereof\ntransportation is only a factor, and the prison cell.  The cell\nhas assumed a leading position since it was brought over from\nAmerica to Europe, where, however, the cellular prisons of St.\nMichael at Rome, and of Gand, had preceded it.\n\nThe cellular system, a product of the reaction against the\nenormous physical and moral putrefaction of the inmates of common\nprisons and labour establishments, may have had, and doubtless\nstill has many advocates, amongst other reasons for the spirit of\npietism and religious penitence which always goes with it; but it\nis open to strong criticism.\n\nThere has already been, amongst the same prison <p 257>experts, a\ncertain retrogressive movement in regard to isolation.  Absolute\nand continued isolation, indeed, both by day and by night\n(``solitary confinement'') was at first recommended, even to the\nintroduction, grotesque in spite of good intentions, of hoods and\nmasks for the prisoners, a medi<ae>val reminiscence almost\nparallel with the Brothers of Pity in some Italian towns, for help\nto the wounded.  Presently it was seen that this sort of thing\ncertainly could not assist in the amendment of the guilty, and\nthen isolation was relaxed (still making it applicable both by day\nand by night) with visits to prisoners by the chaplain, governors,\nand representatives of vigilance and prisoners' aid societies.\nThis is called ``separate confinement.''  After this it was\nrecognised that the real need for isolation was at night, and then\nthe Auburn system was arrived at: isolation in cells by night,\nwith daily labour in common, with an obligation (which cannot be\nenforced) of silence.  And finally, seeing that in spite of the\nthreefold panacea of every prison system (isolation, work, and\ninstruction, especially religious instruction) relapses still\nincreased, it was understood that it might not be very useful to\nsubject a man for months or years to the monastic life of Trappist\nbrothers, in these monstrous human hives (which Bentham brought to\nthe notice of the French Constituent Assembly under the name of\n``panopticons''), and to discharge him from prison at the end of\nhis term, and plunge him into all the temptations of an atmosphere\nto which his lungs had become disaccustomed.\n\nThen the ``progressive system'' was introduced, <p 258>first in\nEngland, where it was devised by Maconochie, next in Ireland,\nwhich has given it a name, alternated with that of Sir W. Crofton.\nThis is the most symmetrically perfect machinery, though reminding\none somewhat of a company of marionettes.  It confirms what was\nsaid by Haeckel, that the actual is a summary of the moods of\naspiration, for it precisely sums up the systems which preceded\nit, each of which constitutes a phase of the progressive system.\nThere is first of all a period of brotherly charity--absolute\nisolation for the prisoner to fall back upon his conscience, or to\nlisten to the voice of remorse, or to receive an impression of\ndevotion and fear.  After this comes the Auburnian phase, of\nisolation by night and labour (when labour is accorded) by day,\nwith the constraint of silence.  Then an intermediary period in\nthe agricultural colony or labour-gang outside the prison, like a\nperiod of convalescence, to accustom the lungs to the keen air of\nliberty.  This is the phase added by Sir W. Crofton to the English\nsystem.  Lastly comes the period of conditional release (on ticket\nof leave), whereby the last portion of the punishment is remitted,\nand will count as expiated if during the time of liberation, and\nfor a succeeding period, the convict does not commit another\ncrime.\n\nThe progressive or retrogressive passage from one phase to another\nis made by a sort of automatic regulator, depending on the number\nof marks gained or lost by the prisoner through his good or bad\nbehaviour, to which we know the moral or psychological value to be\nattached--a value purely negative.\n<p 259>\n\nThis progressive, gradual, or Irish system has obtained a\nsupremacy in Europe, so that even Belgium, the classic land of the\ncellular system, reconsidered the ideas which it had based on\ndaily experience, and was the first continental country to\nintroduce conditional sentences (in 1888), which are the fruit of\nshort sentences and cellular punishments.\n\nI do not deny that this progressive system is better than the\nothers, though we must not forget that the almost miraculous\neffects of amendment and decrease of recidivism (which indeed are\nclaimed for every new system, only to be disproved later on) were\ndue in Ireland to the wholesale emigration of those conditionally\nreleased to North America--an emigration amounting to 46 per cent.\nof the prisoners released.  Nor must we forget that this system,\nwhich requires a trained staff of officers, is less difficult to\nwork in countries where, as in Ireland, there are only a few\nhundred prisoners; but it would be much more difficult in Italy or\nFrance, where the prisoners are numbered by tens of thousands.  In\nthese countries, accordingly, the system will not be practical\nunless the principle of classifying prisoners in biological and\npsychological categories is conjoined with it; for without this we\nshall not get rid of the impersonal system which is the vice of\nour present penal law, and under which, even in our prison\nadministration, we treat the prisoner as a mere symbol, to which\nwe can apply the three conventional rules of the cell, hard\nlabour, and instruction.\n\nBut I am strongly opposed to, or accept simply as <p 260>accessory\n(even for the seclusion of prisoners before trial, after the\npreliminary examination), cellular isolation by itself, which has\nreached the height of absurdity and inhumanity in cases of\nimprisonment for life.\n\nAs Mancini said in 1876, discussing the draft of the Italian penal\ncode, ``the punishment of hard labour for life, which is\nsubstituted in the draft for the capital sentence, differs\nsubstantially in its severity of privation and misery from all\nother modes of imprisonment.  It must be undergone in one or two\nspecial prisons to be erected within the country.  It would be the\nsaddest and most terrible thing which the imagination of man could\nconceive.  These tombs of the living, whom society has rejected\nfor ever, unlike all other prisons, will condemn their inmates to\ncontinuous solitary immurement in cells, and to a life which may\nbe worse than death itself. . . .  This most wretched condition,\nwhich the free man cannot realise without horror, is to last ten\nyears; and it is not to be in the power of man to bring it to an\nend sooner, if the prisoner, broken down by physical weakness, or\nthreatened by loss of reason, cannot endure it any longer.''\n\nAfter this description, I am not sorry that I denounced the\ncellular system as one of the madnesses of the nineteenth century.\n\nThis useless, stupid, inhuman, costly ``tomb of the living'' must\nbe repudiated, even when reduced to its lowest terms by the new\nItalian code, wherein Parliament, accepting part of my amendment,\nfixes the term of absolute seclusion at seven years.\n<p 261>\n\nIt will be seen by this description of cellular imprisonment that\nthe classical criminal and prison experts have logically arrived\nat the conclusion that perpetual punishment should be abolished;\nand this renders recidivism possible even in murder.  But it is\nclear that what we ought to abolish is not perpetual separation,\nbut only the stupidly harsh form of isolation in cells--and this\nnot only in life sentences, but in all sentences.\n\nCellular imprisonment is inhuman, because it blots out or weakens,\nin the cases of the least degenerate criminals, that social sense\nwhich was already feeble in them, and also because it inevitably\nleads to madness or consumption (by onanism, insufficient\nmovement, air, &c.).  Hence it drives the prison authorities, in\norder to avoid these disastrous consequences, to the injustice of\nbuilding cells for murderers which are decidedly comfortable, and\nconsequently a mockery of the honest wretchedness of the cottages\nand garrets of the poor.  The treatment of mental diseases\nrecognises a special form of insanity under the name of prison\nmadness.\n\nCellular imprisonment, in temporary or indefinite sentences, can\ndo nothing for the amendment of the guilty, especially because,\nwhen we do not amend the social environment, it is useless to\nlavish care on our prisoners if, as soon as they quit prison, they\nmust return to the same conditions which led them into crime.  No\nadequate social prevention can in any way be provided by the more\nor less arcadian devices of the prisoners' aid societies.  The\nchief mistake of the prison experts has been to concentrate their\nattention <p 262>exclusively on the cell and in the cell,\nforgetting the external factors of crime; so that, by a familiar\npsychological process, the cell has become for prison experts what\nmoney is to the avaricious: it has ceased to be a means, and has\nbecome an end in itself.\n\nAgain, the cellular system is ineffectual because the very\nisolation which was its original object is incapable of\nrealisation.  Prisoners find a thousand means of carrying on\ncommunication with each other, during their walks, or by writing\non the leaves of books lent to them to read, or by knocking on\ntheir walls according to a conventional alphabet, or by writing in\nthe sand, or by using the drains as telephonic receivers, as was\ndone in the cellular prisons of Mazas, Milan, &c.  Plain proofs of\nthis may be found in Lombroso's ``Les Palimpsestes des Prisons.''\n``The public, and even well-informed persons, honestly believe\nthat the cellular prison is a dumb and paralytic thing, without\ntongue or hands, simply because the law has ordered silence and\ninactivity.  But as no decree, however vigorous, can counteract\nthe nature of things, so this organism speaks, moves, occasionally\nwounds or slays, in spite of all the decrees.  Only, as always\nhappens when a necessity of humanity is opposed by a law, it acts\nby less known, underground and hidden means.''\n\nMoreover, the cellular system is unequal in its application, for\ndifference of race has much to say to it, and in fact it is a\nclumsy machinery of the northern races, repugnant to those of the\nsouth, more dependent on the open air and light.  Apart from that,\nisolation has very different effects amongst people of the same\nnation, according to the different vocations <p 263>of the\nprisoners, especially of occasional offenders.  In this connection\nthe testimony of Faucher, Ferrus, and Tarde is thoroughly just,\nthat in prison administration we ought to observe a distinction\nbetween dwellers in town and country.[23]\n\n\n\n[23] Yet the question whether the cellular system should be\nmodified in accordance with the nationality, social condition, and\nsex of criminals, which has not been brought forward since the\nPrison Congress at Stockholm, was there decided by the following\nresolution:--``The cellular system, where it is in operation, may\nbe applied without distinction of race, social condition (as\nregards townsmen or rural population), or sex, provided that the\nauthorities have regard to these special conditions _in matters of\ndetail_.  Exception may be made in respect of the young, and if\ncellular discipline is applied to them also, it should be in such\na way as not to prejudice their physical and moral development.''\n(``Proceedings,'' 1878, pp. 303, 617.)\n\n\n\nAgain, the cellular system is too costly to be adopted as the only\nform of imprisonment--which, however, is enacted in the Italian\npenal code, the French law of 1875, and elsewhere.\n\nAnd it is just by reason of the enormous expenditure on vast\nprisons that the grievous and mischievous contrast arises between\nthe comforts provided for murderers and men guilty of arson in\ntheir cells and the privations to which the honest poor are\nexposed in hospitals, poorhouses, town garrets, country hovels,\nand barracks.  One of the most significant results which I noticed\nat the exhibition of various plans of cells in connection with the\nPrison Congress at Rome in 1885 was that it demonstrated to the\ngeneral public how the cellular system treats prisoners (whether\nbefore trial or after sentence) better than the poor, who continue\nto be honest in spite of their wretchedness.[23]\n\n\n\n[23] Even prison experts have been concerned by the vast expense\nof the cellular system, and the following question was brought\nforward at the <p 264>Congress at Rome:--``What modifications\nwould be possible, in accordance with recent experience, in the\nconstruction of cellular prisons so as to render it more simple\nand less costly, without detriment to the necessary conditions of\na sound and intelligent application of the system?''  Detailed\nrecommendations were agreed to on the motion of M. Herbette; but\nthe system is unchanged, with requirements which can be only very\nslightly reduced.\n\n\n<p 264>\n\nIn Germany, as well as in France and Italy, legislation has\nordained, by codes and special laws, the cellular system for all\npunishment by imprisonment; but fortunately the system has not yet\nbeen adopted, thanks to its enormous cost.  So that we have the\nfurther absurdity of codes based on prison systems which have no\nactual existence.  And since criminals have their part in the law,\nnot as it is written but as it is carried out, the result is\nnaturally disastrous.\n\nThus the cellular system bears hard upon the honest classes, both\nby its enormous cost, under the form of taxation, and by\ncompetition with free and honest labour.  The competition is moral\nin the first place, for the criminal is always assured of daily\nwork, lodgings, and food, whilst the honest workman is assured of\nneither.  Even the economic competition, though not extensive when\nwe take the totals of free workmen and prisoners, is still very\nkeen in particular places and for particular industries, whilst\nprison labour never indemnifies the State for its expenditure; for\nclearly with cellular isolation it is impossible to organise\nimportant and profitable industry.  It is the small industries,\nsuch as shoemaking and carpentry, which crush the same free\nindustries all round the prison, for they cannot stand against the\nartificial competition created by the nominal wages of the prison\nhands.  Though for moral and financial <p 265>reasons the convicts\nmust work, it is evident that on these grounds we cannot accept\nthe cellular system as a pattern of prison organisation.\n\nIt is quite sufficient, in prisons for the segregation of\ncriminals, to provide for isolation by night, which requires\nbuildings far more simple and less costly than those of the\ncellular prisons.\n\nWork in the open air is the only useful basis of organisation for\nconvict prisons.\n\nAir, light, movement, field labour, especially in southern\ncounties and for the majority of prisoners, who are rural--these\nare the only physical and moral disinfectants possible for\nprisoners not entirely degenerate, or likely to prevent at least\nthe absolute brutalisation of the incorrigible, by giving them\nhealthy and more remunerative work.\n\nThe penal agricultural colony, in lands which need clearing, is\nthe best for adults, passing from the least to the most healthy\naccording to the categories of criminals--born, habitual,\noccasional--and according to the gravity of the crimes committed.\nTo this may be added, for convicts less capable of restoration to\nsocial life, labour in mines, especially when the mines are State\nproperty.  What I have said of malaria I say of fire-damp: it is\nmuch better that these should kill off criminals, than honest\nworkmen.\n\nThe penal agricultural colony in lands already cultivated is best\nfor children and young people.\n\nThis is the ideal and the typical form of segregation for\ncriminals, against whom it would not be sufficient to exact strict\nreparation of damage, on the principles already set forth.\n<p 266>\n\nWherever there is a crowding of humanity, there is human\nfermentation and putrefaction.  Only labour in the open air will\nsecure physical and moral health.  And if agricultural work would\nbe less fitted for criminals from the towns, there is no reason\nwhy an agricultural colony should not make itself as far as\npossible self-sufficing by means of workshops where prisoners\ncould ply the trade to which they were accustomed when at liberty.\nFor town convicts without a trade, such as vagabonds, beggars, and\nthe like, on the ground of their muscular incapacity for hard and\nregular work, an agricultural colony is still the most fit, for it\nprovides light and varied occupations, as the agricultural\ncolonies of Holland, Belgium, and Austria bear witness.\n\nThe same evolution will take place in regard to the segregation of\ncriminals as in regard to the seclusion of the insane; first,\nhospitals and prisons, with a terrible communion of corruption in\nboth cases; then barrack life, in asylums or penitentiaries, vast\nand isolated; lastly, for the insane, a system of so-called\nvillage asylums, and even a free colony for harmless idiots who\ncan be put to agricultural work and minor trades, as at Gheel in\nBelgium.  Similarly for criminals, the sanitary ``elbow room'' of\nagricultural colonies will be substituted for the infectious\nbarrack-life of the great prisons.\n\n\nAs for habitual criminals, their anthropological characteristics\nremind us that we must distinguish between the two crises of their\ncriminal activity, and, as a consequence, between the methods of\ndefence <p 267>against them.  That is to say, we must distinguish\nbetween the initial moment at which they commit their first crime\nand the subsequent period in which they become habitual offenders,\nrecidivists, and even incorrigible.\n\nThus it is clear that at the initial moment of their criminal\ncareer they ought to be subjected to the measures which I am about\nto indicate for occasional criminals; whereas, when from\noccasional they have become, partly by their imprisonment,\nhabitual offenders, they must be subjected to the measures already\nindicated for born criminals.  The latter are incorrigible through\ncongenital tendency to degenerate, and the former are incorrigible\nthrough acquired tendency; but they end in the same degree of\nanti-sociality and brutalisation.  There is, however, this\ndifference, that habitual offenders nearly always commit less\nserious crimes, such as theft, swindling, forgery, indecent\nassault, whilst the born criminals, though they may be petty\nthieves, or not very formidable swindlers, are more frequently\nmurderers, footpads, guilty of arson, or the like.  Thus the\ndiscipline of their segregation must vary accordingly.\n\n\nFor occasional criminals, social defence must have a character of\nprevention rather than of repression, so as to save them from\nbeing driven, by a mistaken prison organisation, to become\nrecidivists, and therefore habitual and incorrigible criminals.\n\nIt is especially important in this category to discriminate\nbetween the young and the adults, for <p 268>with the former, far\nmore than with the latter, the preventive methods may have a\nsensible effect in diminishing crime.  But we must take care, in\nplace of the pedantic graduation of responsibility which satisfies\nthe penal codes, to substitute a physiological and psychical\ntreatment of children and young people, who are actual criminals\nor framing for crime.\n\nBeginning with the physical and moral treatment of foundling\nchildren as one of the most effectual penal substitutes, and\nadvancing to reformatory constraint and penal sentences upon the\nyoung, there is an entire system crying for radical reform, from\nwhich imprisonment for young persons should always be excluded.\nWe must therefore abolish the so-called houses of correction; for,\ntaking no account of the absurd and dangerous confusion created by\nthe three classes of children committed for paternal correction,\nfor begging and vagrancy, and for offences, no good can ever come\nof it, for the herding and crowding together are nowhere more\nproductive of fermentation and putrefaction than amongst the\nyoung.\n\nThere is nothing for them but separate boarding-out with families\nof honest country folk, or else agricultural colonies with a\ndiscipline different from that of the colonies for adult\ncriminals, but still based on the rule of isolation by night, work\nin the open air, and as little crowding as possible.\n\nFor adult occasional criminals it is unnecessary to insist any\nfurther on the absurdity and danger of short terms of\nimprisonment, with or without isolation in cells, which now\nconstitute the almost <p 269>exclusive mode of repression.  A few\ndays in prison, mostly in association with habitual criminals,\ncannot exercise any deterrent influence, especially in the\ngrotesque minimum of one day, or three days, as provided by the\nDutch, Italian, and other codes.  On the contrary, they are\nattended by disastrous effects, by destroying the serious\ncharacter of justice, relieving prisoners of all fear of\npunishment, and consequently driving them to relapse, under the\ninfluence of the disgrace already suffered, and of the corrupting\nand compromising association with habitual criminals in prison.\n\nThe results of these short terms, indeed, which impose about the\nsame restriction of liberty as an attack of indigestion, or a\nheavy fall of snow, are so manifest that the objection to them is\nnow almost unanimous, though they still form the basis of the most\nrecent penal codes.\n\nAs to the substitution of other repressive methods in the many\ncases of sentence for light offences, theorists and legislators\nhave proposed domiciliary arrest, sureties, judicial warnings,\ncompulsory work without imprisonment, conditional suspension of a\nsentence or a punishment, qualified banishment.  For the moment\nthere is a marked preference for conditional sentences.\n\nIn my opinion, however, none of these substitutes or short terms\nof imprisonment can be applied as effectively or as generally as\nis necessary for the large class of occasional offenders.\n\nDomiciliary arrests, indeed, which the Italian penal code applies\nonly to women and minors for a first <p 270>contravention of the\nlaw, with detention in the house, cannot be made effective.  They\nwould be useless for those already obliged to remain at home by\ntheir daily occupations, and for the rich, who could have any form\nof distraction in their own houses; and they would be injurious to\nthose who have to earn a living for themselves and their families\nin workrooms, shops, offices, &c.  Moreover, this domiciliary\ndetention would be very difficult in the great towns, where it\nwould probably require a sentinel for every condemned person.\n\nBail for good behaviour is too unequal in the case of the poor and\nthe rich, and therefore too rarely applicable to be any more than\nan exceptional and accessory measure, taken in conjunction with\nthe payment of damages; and this even when it is given by\nsureties.\n\nJudicial warning, with or without security, which the new Italian\npenal code has sought to revive, in spite of many years'\nexperience under the older codes, cannot be seriously treated.\nEither the prisoner is an occasional offender, or an offender\nthrough passion, having a sense of honour, in which case public\nopinion is itself a sufficient lesson for him, without the need of\na little moral lecture from the judge; or else he has no such\nmoral sensibility, and then the warning is a mere useless\nceremony, without effect either on the criminal or on the public.\nSo true is this that judicial warning (a different thing from\npolice warning, which is another so-called preventive measure,\nboth ineffectual and injurious) is rarely applied by magistrates.\n<p 271>\n\nCompulsory work without imprisonment may be admitted, not as a\nmain punishment, but as a mode of enforcing strict reparation of\ndamage, which I still believe to be the only suitable measure for\noccasional offenders, when the offence is slight.\n\nThe same must be said for qualified banishment (temporary removal\nfrom the place where the crime was committed), which may be added\nas a preventive measure, and as a satisfaction for the injured\nparty, in the same cases where the payment of damages is the\nprincipal retribution.\n\nThere remains the conditional sentence.  A judge may decide, in\nthe case of first offenders who appear to him to call for such\ntreatment, that the sentence or the execution of the sentence,\nshall be suspended for a given period, after which, if the\noffender has been of good behaviour, and has not committed another\noffence, the sentence is effaced and the condemnation is regarded\nas non-existent; whilst in the other case the sentence takes\neffect, and the punishment is added to that of the new crime.\n\nThis conditional suspension, however, assumes two very different\nforms.\n\nAt Boston, in the State of Massachusetts, from the year 1870 in\nthe case of minors, and from 1878 in the case of adults, judgment\nis suspended without regard even to the gravity of the crime or to\nthe antecedents of the criminal; and this custom has applied to\nthe entire State from the year 1880.  All that the judge does is\nto fix the period of probation.  There is a probation officer\nwhose business it is to keep his eye on the persons affected, and\nwho has <p 272>extensive powers, including that of bringing them\nup for sentence even for disorderly conduct, without waiting for\nan actual relapse.  This system has also been introduced into New\nZealand and Australia (1886).\n\nIn England, after the advocacy of the probation system by the\nHoward Association, an Act was passed in 1887 ``to permit the\nconditional Release of first Offenders in certain cases.''  This\nlaw combines probation with sureties for good conduct.  Judgment\nis given, but sentence is not pronounced.  The suspension is not\ngranted to any one who has previously committed an offence, or\nwhose first offence would be liable to a punishment exceeding two\nyears' imprisonment.  There is no probation officer, for\nsupervision is replaced by personal or other sureties for good\nbehaviour.\n\nOn the continent of Europe another form has been adopted.  There\nis no supervision by a special officer, and no surety for good\nbehaviour; judgment is delivered and sentence pronounced; and the\nsuspension is not forfeited by disorderly conduct, but only by an\nactual relapse.\n\nThis system, so far as the purpose was not effected by various\nconditions as to the duration of punishment, which left room for\nconditional sentences, as to the interval for taking cognisance of\nrelapse, and other details, was proposed in France (1884) by\nSenator B<e'>renger; but Belgium was the first country to adopt it\nin the law of 1888 ``on conditional release and conditional\nsentences;'' and France followed in 1891, with the law ``on the\nmodification and increase of punishments.''\n<p 273>\n\nBefore that time, at the Prison Congresses of London (1872) and\nRome (1885), there had been some discussion, without resolutions,\non the advisability of substituting for punishment with hard\nlabour either simple detention without labour or compulsory labour\nwithout imprisonment, or removal from the place where the offence\nwas committed, or judicial admonition.\n\nBut the most noteworthy advocacy of conditional sentences, after\nthe action taken by the Howard Association in 1881, came from the\nInternational Union of Penal Legislation, which at its Conference\nat Berne in 1889 adopted a resolution in its favour, whilst\ninsisting, at the suggestion of M. Garofalo, ``on the necessity of\ndeciding its limitation according to local conditions, and to the\npublic opinion and moral characteristics of various nations.''\n\nThe Prison Congress of St. Petersburg discussed the substitution\nof judicial admonition or conditional sentences for short terms of\nimprisonment; but no resolution could be arrived at on this\noccasion, and the matter was postponed to the next international\nPrison Congress (Paris, 1895).\n\nIn Austria and Germany, again, several Bills have been introduced,\ndealing with conditional sentences.\n\nThere are statistics for Belgium on the operation of this system.\nThe law of 1888 requires the keeper of the seals to report\nannually to Parliament; and that authority drew up two reports,\ndated May 14, 1890, and July 7, 1891.\n\nFrom the day when the law came into operation up to December 31,\n1889, out of 61,787 sentences in <p 274>the Correctional\nTribunals, 8,696 were conditional; and there were 192 relapses.\nOut of 222,492 sentences in the Police Courts, 4,499 were\nconditional, and there were 45 relapses.\n\nThese 13,195 conditional sentences included 8,485 for crimes and\noffences under the penal code; 2,286 for breaches of police\nregulations; 447 for breaches of communal and provincial\nregulations; and 1,977 for contraventions of special laws.\n\nThe crimes and offences for which these sentences have been most\nfrequently pronounced are as follows:--\n\n\n                                    Correctional.   Police.\nMalicious Wounding  ... ... ... ... ... 3,339   ... 491\nThefts, &c  ... ... ... ... ... ... 1,803   ... 206\nResistance to and attacks on Authorities    961     ... 67\nDestruction of Inclosures and Property  211     ... 56\nSwindling and Breach of Trust   ...  ...    125     ... 5\nSlander and Defamation  ... ... ... ... 113     ... 79\nImmorality  ... ... ... ... ... ... 112     ... 10\n\nOffences below 100 were: Abusive language, 99; Indecent assaults,\n59; Threats, 58; Forgery, 49; Adultery, 48; Adulteration of food,\n44; Unlawful wounding, 45; Unlawful possession, 31; Unlawful\ncarrying and sale of arms, 30; Bankruptcy, 26; Accidental\nhomicide, 20.\n\nIn the year 1890, out of 41,330 sentences in the Correctional\nTribunals, whereof 36,660 were not over six months' imprisonment,\n7,932 were conditional, and there were 223 relapses.  Out of\n121,461 in the Police Courts, 6,377 were conditional, and there\nwere 49 relapses.\n\nThe proportion for various offences was approximately the same as\nin the previous year.\n\nThese figures, it is true, do not tell us much about <p 275>the\neffects of conditional sentences in Belgium, as we might expect\nfrom the brevity of the experiment; so that the question still\nremains in the theoretical phase.\n\nThe statistics of the Massachusetts probation system are not much\nmore instructive.\n\nAccording to the decennial report (1879-88) of Mr. Savage,\nprobation officer at Boston, imprisonment was remitted in the\ncounty of Suffolk (including Boston) to 322 persons in 1879 and to\n880 in 1888; whilst the number officially recorded for the\nfollowing year was 994.  In the course of ten years the probation\nofficer inquired into the cases of 27,052 persons liable to\nsupervision.  Of these, 7,251 were put on probation, and 580 were\ndeprived of the benefit of the law.\n\nThe grounds on which the probation system was applied in\nMassachusetts were strikingly different from the circumstances\nunder which conditional sentences were recorded in Belgium.  Thus\nin Boston there were put on probation, between 1879 and 1888,\n3,161 persons charged with drunkenness for the first time, 222\ncharged with habitual drunkenness, 211 with drunkenness for the\nthird time, 958 with theft, 764 with solicitation, 470 with\ninflicting bodily harm, 274 with disorderly conduct and idleness,\n240 with violation of domicile, especially with intrusion in\nbusiness premises.\n\nThus, apart from the difference of penal legislation and social\nlife in the two countries, the Boston system is applied mainly to\ndrunkards, who are not true criminals by the mere fact of\nintoxication.\n<p 276>\n\nAs for the statistics of ascertained relapse, which in Boston\nreached 64 out of 1,125 (6 per cent.) in 1889, I think they should\nbe received with caution.  In the case of every new penal or\npenitentiary system or measure, we never fail to receive more or\nless wonderful figures on the results obtained; but the common\nfate of all these splendid results has always been that they\ndwindle down, even if they do not turn into a negative quantity,\nso as to indicate the necessity of other more practical and\nserviceable measures.  The reason is, and will continue to be the\nsame, namely, that legislators, judges, and prison warders have no\nadequate knowledge of criminals, and their activity is anything\nbut harmonious.  This accounts for the superficial character, if\nnothing more, of the measures which are taken, and which apply far\nmore to the crime than to the criminal, without so much as\ntouching the true and deep-seated roots of crime.  Hence also the\ninevitable disillusion, almost before the new device is a month\nold.\n\nI by no means admit the two principal objections of MM.\nKirchenheim and Wach, that the conditional sentence is repugnant\nto the principle of absolute justice, according to which every\noffence should be visited by a corresponding punishment, and that\nshort terms of imprisonment, if they have not always produced a\ngood result, ought not to be abolished, but only applied in a more\nsuitable and efficacious manner.\n\nThe first objection will not weigh much with those who are guided\nby the principles and method of the positive school.  As M.\nGautier says, it is absolutely <p 277>useless to dispute about\nconsequences when we start from premisses so opposed to each other\nas retributive justice, according to which every fault demands a\nproportional punishment--``fiat justitia pereat mundus''--and\nsocial defence, according to which a justice without social\nadvantage is an unjust justice, afflicted with metaphysical\ndegeneracy.\n\nThe second objection appears to me to have no better foundation,\nfor the disadvantages of punishments by short terms of\nimprisonment are organic and inevitable defects.  There is no\nchance of their practical amelioration, for they have all been\ntried, from the system of association to that of absolute\nisolation, from the most inflexible vigour to the mildest\ntreatment.  Amelioration of short-term punishments can only have\nan indirect influence by way of palliation; but it is the actual\nimprisonment for a short term which is trifling and unavailing.\n\nAt the same time, and not to mention other objections on points of\ndetail, specially applicable to the form given to conditional\nsentences on the continent of Europe, as compared with the\nAmerican system, (which is certainly better, since it does not\nleave the offender to himself, and is not restricted to the simple\nlegal relapse), I am not enthusiastically in favour of the\nconditional sentence.  And my lack of enthusiasm, in spite of the\nfirst impression, which was decidedly favourable, is based on\ndifferent grounds from those hitherto stated by the opponents of\nthis reform.\n\nIn the earliest edition of this work I maintained that repression\nought to be mild in form for occa<p 278>sional criminals, and\nprogressively severe for recidivists and habitual evildoers, until\nit reached perpetual segregation.  The Italian proverb, that ``the\nfirst fault is pardoned and the second whipped,'' is an\nunconscious confirmation of the popular opinion.  And from this\npoint of view the conditional sentence, if combined as in the\nFrench law with progressive severity of repression for\nrecidivists, is sufficiently attractive in the first instance.\n\nBut the conditional sentence, to consider it for a moment as it\nhas hitherto been propounded and carried out, has two\ncharacteristic defects, in common with the actual penal system, of\nwhich its advocates, for the most part balancing between the\nclassical and positive school, cannot get rid.\n\nIn the first place, whilst the classical school has fixed its\nattention on crime, and the positive school studies the criminal,\nespecially in regard to his biological and psychological\ncharacter, the advocates of the conditional sentence (and of the\nlaws which have so far brought it into operation) oscillate\nbetween the two standpoints, considering the criminal, no doubt,\nrather than the crime, but only the average and abstract criminal,\nnot the living and palpitating criminal, as he is to be found in\nhis several categories.  In proof of this it is enough to observe\nthat the ninth article of the Belgian law admits the conditional\nsentence, so far as punishment is concerned, when this punishment\ndoes not exceed six months, _*even if the period is made up by the\ncumulation of two or more!_  In other words, the conditional\nsentence is allowed in the case of a criminal who has\ncom<p 279>mitted several offences--which substantially (except in\nthe few cases of connected offences due to the same action, or\narising out of the same occasion) is a mere case of relapse, and\ntherefore proves in the majority of cases that the law is not\ndealing with true occasional criminals; for these, as a rule, like\ncriminals of passion, only commit a single crime or offence.\n\nThe two fundamental conditions of the conditional sentence in\nEurope (a slight infraction and a nonrelapsed criminal) do not,\ntherefore, afford a complete guarantee of the utility of its\napplication.\n\nIt is true that this system tends to fix the attention of the\njudge on the personal conditions of the prisoner, requiring him to\ndecide if the conditional sentence is suitable to the particular\noccasion, having regard to the special circumstances of the action\nand the individual, apart from the legal limitations of the\noffence and of the punishment.\n\nBut we know that the crowding of the prisons with persons\ncondemned to short terms of imprisonment is attended by a grievous\ncrowding in the courts of prisoners accused of slight offences and\ncontraventions.  Thus it is inevitable that the judges, even apart\nfrom their ignorance of the biological and psychological\ncharacters of the offenders, being compelled to decide ten or\ntwenty cases every day, cannot fix their attention on the\nprocession of figures which files past the magic lantern of the\ncourts, but simply leave them with a ticket bearing the number of\nthe article which applies, not to _*them,_ but to their particular\ninfraction of the law.  Thus the judges will come to\n<p 280>pronouncing the conditional sentence almost mechanically,\njust as they have come to give the benefit of attenuating\ncircumstances by force of habit This device also was introduced in\nFrance in 1832, in order to ``individualise punishment''--that is\nto say, to compel the judge to apply his sentence rather to the\ncriminal than to the crime.\n\nSo long as penal procedure is not radically reformed, as we have\nproposed, in such a manner that the inquiry, the discussion, the\ndecision upon the evidence, which are the only proper elements of\npenal justice, aim at and lead up to the determination of a\nprisoner's biological and psychological type, it will be humanly\nimpossible for the practical application of these judicial\nmeasures to overcome the mechanical impersonality of justice,\nwhich applies rather to the crime than to the criminal.\n\nHence the conditional sentence, though it was evolved by the abuse\nand disastrous effects of short terms of imprisonment, and in\nspite of its generating principle that ``the first fault is\npardoned and the second whipped,'' has to-day only the character\nof an eclectic graft on the old classic stock of penal law and\nprocedure.  As such, notwithstanding its attractive features (for\nit indicates a step in advance towards the positive system of\nsocial defence, which desires to see the application of collective\ndefence to the individual's power of offence), it seems to me to\nbe destined, not long after its earliest application, to deceive\nthe anticipations of happy and beneficent results, such as its\nadvocates entertain.\n\nMoreover, the conditional sentence, precisely be<p 281>cause it is\na graft on the old classic stock of penal justice, has another\nvery serious defect, inasmuch as it overlooks the victims of the\noffence.\n\nIts advocates, in fact, continue to maintain that reparation of\ndamage is a private concern, for which they benevolently recommend\na strict remedy, but which they nevertheless, in practice,\nentirely overlook.\n\nThe offender who is conditionally sentenced is, therefore, to\nsecure a suspension of punishment--which, indeed, it is as well to\nremember, he also secures, often enough, by a legal limitation,\nor, as in Italy, by the remission of punishments under three\nmonths, accorded whenever (as is generally the case) there is a\npetition for pardon.  But is there any one who gives a thought to\nthe victims?\n\nFrom this point of view it may even be said that the conditional\nsentence makes things worse than before; for the victims are not\nto have so much as the satisfaction of seeing punishment inflicted\non those who have injured them, in cases of assault, theft,\nswindling, and the like.  And it is useless to make the platonic\nremark, as M. Fayer has done, that punishment is punishment even\nwhen conditional, and involves the censure of the public\nauthority, and holds in reserve a punishment for relapse, and\nhangs over the head of the offender until his term of probation\nhas expired.\n\nAll this is pretty enough--except the relapse, which implies the\npoor consolation of a repetition of the offence, which would be no\ngreat satisfaction for the victims of the first.  But it is all\nhypothetical and <p 282>theoretical.  The essential thing, so far\nas the victims are concerned, is that the offender goes\nunpunished.\n\nIt is true that occasional offenders deserve consideration, from\nthe point of view of prevention in particular; but honest folk who\nare injured by them deserve it still more.\n\nI do not therefore agree with Garofalo, who proposed at Brussels\nthat the conditional sentence should be subject to the consent of\nthe injured party; but I think that it ought not to be permitted\nuntil there has been an indemnification for the victims of the\noffence, or at least a guarantee, either by the offender, or\ndirectly by the State.\n\nIn short, for occasional criminals who commit slight offences, in\ncircumstances which show that they are not of a dangerous type, I\nsay, as I have said already, that reparation of the damage\ninflicted would suffice as a defensive measure, without a\nconditional sentence of imprisonment\n\nAs to the occasional criminals who commit serious offences, for\nwhich reparation alone would not be sufficient, temporary removal\nfrom the scene of the crime should be added in the less serious\ncases, whilst in the cases of greater gravity, owing to material\nand personal considerations, there should be indefinite\nsegregation in an agricultural colony, with lighter work and\nmilder discipline than those prescribed in colonies for born\ncriminals and recidivists.\n\n\nThe last category is that of criminals through an impulse of\npassion, not anti-social but susceptible of excuse, such as love,\nhonour, and the like.\n<p 283>\n\nFor these individuals all punishment is clearly useless, at any\nrate as a psychological counteraction of crime, for the very\nconditions of the psychological convulsion which caused them to\noffend precludes any deterrent influence in a legal menace.\n\nI therefore believe that in typical cases of criminals of passion,\nwhere there is no clear demand for mental treatment in a criminal\nlunatic asylum, imprisonment is of no use whatever.  Strict\nreparation of damage will suffice to punish them, whilst they are\npunished already by genuine and sincere remorse immediately after\nthe criminal explosion of their legitimate passion.  Temporary\nremoval from the scene of their crime and from the residence of\nthe victim's family might be superadded.\n\nNevertheless it must not be forgotten that I say this in\nconnection with criminals in whom the passionate impulse is really\nexceptional, and who present the physiological and psychical\nfeatures of the genuine criminal of passion which I enumerated in\nthe first chapter.\n\nI come to a different conclusion in the case of criminals who have\nmerely been provoked, who do not completely present these\nfeatures, who are actuated by a combination of social and\nexcusable passion with an anti-social passion, such as hate,\nvengeance, anger, ambition, &c.  Of such a kind are murderers\ncarried away by anger just in itself, by blood-feuds, or desire to\navenge the honour of their family, by vindication of personal\nhonour, by grave suspicion of adultery, &c.; persons guilty of\nmalicious wounding, disfigurement through erotic motives, and the\nlike.  <p 284>These may be classed as occasional criminals, and\ntreated accordingly{.??}\n\n\nSuch, then, in general outline, is the positive system of social,\npreventive, and repressive defence against crimes and criminals,\nin accordance with the inferences from a scientific study of crime\nas a natural and social phenomenon.\n\nIt is a defensive system which, in the nature of things, must of\nnecessity be substituted for the criminal and penitentiary systems\nof the classical school, so soon as the daily experience of every\nnation shall have established the conviction, which at this moment\nis more or less profound, but merely of a general character, that\nthese systems are henceforth incompatible with the needs of\nsociety, not only by their crude pedantry, but also because their\nconsequences are becoming daily more disastrous.",
