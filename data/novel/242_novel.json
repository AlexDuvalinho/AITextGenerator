He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska\ntown--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed\nthrough never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and\nbright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in\nthe observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red\ndust lay deep over everything. The dust and heat, the burning wind,\nreminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to\nspend one’s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and\ncorn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the\nworld lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is fairly\nstifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy\nharvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole country is\nstripped bare and gray as sheet-iron. We agreed that no one who had not\ngrown up in a little prairie town could know anything about it. It was a\nkind of freemasonry, we said.\n\n\nAlthough Jim Burden and I both live in New York, and are old friends, I\ndo not see much of him there. He is legal counsel for one of the great\nWestern railways, and is sometimes away from his New York office for\nweeks together. That is one reason why we do not often meet. Another is\nthat I do not like his wife.\n\nWhen Jim was still an obscure young lawyer, struggling to make his way\nin New York, his career was suddenly advanced by a brilliant marriage.\nGenevieve Whitney was the only daughter of a distinguished man. Her\nmarriage with young Burden was the subject of sharp comment at the time.\nIt was said she had been brutally jilted by her cousin, Rutland Whitney,\nand that she married this unknown man from the West out of bravado. She\nwas a restless, headstrong girl, even then, who liked to astonish\nher friends. Later, when I knew her, she was always doing something\nunexpected. She gave one of her town houses for a Suffrage headquarters,\nproduced one of her own plays at the Princess Theater, was arrested\nfor picketing during a garment-makers’ strike, etc. I am never able to\nbelieve that she has much feeling for the causes to which she lends her\nname and her fleeting interest. She is handsome, energetic, executive,\nbut to me she seems unimpressionable and temperamentally incapable of\nenthusiasm. Her husband’s quiet tastes irritate her, I think, and she\nfinds it worth while to play the patroness to a group of young poets and\npainters of advanced ideas and mediocre ability. She has her own fortune\nand lives her own life. For some reason, she wishes to remain Mrs. James\nBurden.\n\nAs for Jim, no disappointments have been severe enough to chill his\nnaturally romantic and ardent disposition. This disposition, though it\noften made him seem very funny when he was a boy, has been one of the\nstrongest elements in his success. He loves with a personal passion the\ngreat country through which his railway runs and branches. His faith\nin it and his knowledge of it have played an important part in its\ndevelopment. He is always able to raise capital for new enterprises in\nWyoming or Montana, and has helped young men out there to do remarkable\nthings in mines and timber and oil. If a young man with an idea can once\nget Jim Burden’s attention, can manage to accompany him when he goes off\ninto the wilds hunting for lost parks or exploring new canyons, then the\nmoney which means action is usually forthcoming. Jim is still able to\nlose himself in those big Western dreams. Though he is over forty now,\nhe meets new people and new enterprises with the impulsiveness by which\nhis boyhood friends remember him. He never seems to me to grow older.\nHis fresh color and sandy hair and quick-changing blue eyes are those\nof a young man, and his sympathetic, solicitous interest in women is as\nyouthful as it is Western and American.\n\nDuring that burning day when we were crossing Iowa, our talk kept\nreturning to a central figure, a Bohemian girl whom we had known\nlong ago and whom both of us admired. More than any other person we\nremembered, this girl seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions,\nthe whole adventure of our childhood. To speak her name was to call\nup pictures of people and places, to set a quiet drama going in one’s\nbrain. I had lost sight of her altogether, but Jim had found her again\nafter long years, had renewed a friendship that meant a great deal to\nhim, and out of his busy life had set apart time enough to enjoy that\nfriendship. His mind was full of her that day. He made me see her again,\nfeel her presence, revived all my old affection for her.\n\n“I can’t see,” he said impetuously, “why you have never written anything\nabout Antonia.”\n\nI told him I had always felt that other people--he himself, for one knew\nher much better than I. I was ready, however, to make an agreement with\nhim; I would set down on paper all that I remembered of Antonia if he\nwould do the same. We might, in this way, get a picture of her.\n\nHe rumpled his hair with a quick, excited gesture, which with him often\nannounces a new determination, and I could see that my suggestion took\nhold of him. “Maybe I will, maybe I will!” he declared. He stared out\nof the window for a few moments, and when he turned to me again his eyes\nhad the sudden clearness that comes from something the mind itself sees.\n“Of course,” he said, “I should have to do it in a direct way, and say\na great deal about myself. It’s through myself that I knew and felt her,\nand I’ve had no practice in any other form of presentation.”\n\nI told him that how he knew her and felt her was exactly what I most\nwanted to know about Antonia. He had had opportunities that I, as a\nlittle girl who watched her come and go, had not.\n\nMonths afterward Jim Burden arrived at my apartment one stormy winter\nafternoon, with a bulging legal portfolio sheltered under his fur\novercoat. He brought it into the sitting-room with him and tapped it\nwith some pride as he stood warming his hands.\n\n“I finished it last night--the thing about Antonia,” he said. “Now, what\nabout yours?”\n\nI had to confess that mine had not gone beyond a few straggling notes.\n\n“Notes? I didn’t make any.” He drank his tea all at once and put down\nthe cup. “I didn’t arrange or rearrange. I simply wrote down what of\nherself and myself and other people Antonia’s name recalls to me. I\nsuppose it hasn’t any form. It hasn’t any title, either.” He went into\nthe next room, sat down at my desk and wrote on the pinkish face of\nthe portfolio the word, “Antonia.” He frowned at this a moment, then\nprefixed another word, making it “My Antonia.” That seemed to satisfy\nhim.\n\n“Read it as soon as you can,” he said, rising, “but don’t let it\ninfluence your own story.”\n\nMy own story was never written, but the following narrative is Jim’s\nmanuscript, substantially as he brought it to me.\n\n\nNOTE: The Bohemian name Antonia is strongly accented on the first\nsyllable, like the English name Anthony, and the ‘i’ is, of course,\ngiven the sound of long ‘e’. The name is pronounced An’-ton-ee-ah.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK I. The Shimerdas\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nI FIRST HEARD OF Antonia on what seemed to me an interminable journey\nacross the great midland plain of North America. I was ten years\nold then; I had lost both my father and mother within a year, and my\nVirginia relatives were sending me out to my grandparents, who lived in\nNebraska. I travelled in the care of a mountain boy, Jake Marpole, one\nof the ‘hands’ on my father’s old farm under the Blue Ridge, who was now\ngoing West to work for my grandfather. Jake’s experience of the world\nwas not much wider than mine. He had never been in a railway train until\nthe morning when we set out together to try our fortunes in a new world.\n\nWe went all the way in day-coaches, becoming more sticky and grimy with\neach stage of the journey. Jake bought everything the newsboys offered\nhim: candy, oranges, brass collar buttons, a watch-charm, and for me a\n‘Life of Jesse James,’ which I remember as one of the most satisfactory\nbooks I have ever read. Beyond Chicago we were under the protection of a\nfriendly passenger conductor, who knew all about the country to which\nwe were going and gave us a great deal of advice in exchange for our\nconfidence. He seemed to us an experienced and worldly man who had been\nalmost everywhere; in his conversation he threw out lightly the names\nof distant states and cities. He wore the rings and pins and badges of\ndifferent fraternal orders to which he belonged. Even his cuff-buttons\nwere engraved with hieroglyphics, and he was more inscribed than an\nEgyptian obelisk.\n\nOnce when he sat down to chat, he told us that in the immigrant car\nahead there was a family from ‘across the water’ whose destination was\nthe same as ours.\n\n‘They can’t any of them speak English, except one little girl, and all\nshe can say is “We go Black Hawk, Nebraska.” She’s not much older than\nyou, twelve or thirteen, maybe, and she’s as bright as a new dollar.\nDon’t you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy? She’s got the pretty\nbrown eyes, too!’\n\nThis last remark made me bashful, and I shook my head and settled down\nto ‘Jesse James.’ Jake nodded at me approvingly and said you were likely\nto get diseases from foreigners.\n\nI do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the\nlong day’s journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed\nso many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable\nabout Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska.\n\nI had been sleeping, curled up in a red plush seat, for a long while\nwhen we reached Black Hawk. Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We\nstumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running\nabout with lanterns. I couldn’t see any town, or even distant lights; we\nwere surrounded by utter darkness. The engine was panting heavily after\nits long run. In the red glow from the fire-box, a group of people stood\nhuddled together on the platform, encumbered by bundles and boxes. I\nknew this must be the immigrant family the conductor had told us about.\nThe woman wore a fringed shawl tied over her head, and she carried a\nlittle tin trunk in her arms, hugging it as if it were a baby. There\nwas an old man, tall and stooped. Two half-grown boys and a girl stood\nholding oilcloth bundles, and a little girl clung to her mother’s\nskirts. Presently a man with a lantern approached them and began\nto talk, shouting and exclaiming. I pricked up my ears, for it was\npositively the first time I had ever heard a foreign tongue.\n\nAnother lantern came along. A bantering voice called out: ‘Hello, are\nyou Mr. Burden’s folks? If you are, it’s me you’re looking for. I’m\nOtto Fuchs. I’m Mr. Burden’s hired man, and I’m to drive you out. Hello,\nJimmy, ain’t you scared to come so far west?’\n\nI looked up with interest at the new face in the lantern-light. He might\nhave stepped out of the pages of ‘Jesse James.’ He wore a sombrero\nhat, with a wide leather band and a bright buckle, and the ends of his\nmoustache were twisted up stiffly, like little horns. He looked lively\nand ferocious, I thought, and as if he had a history. A long scar ran\nacross one cheek and drew the corner of his mouth up in a sinister curl.\nThe top of his left ear was gone, and his skin was brown as an Indian’s.\nSurely this was the face of a desperado. As he walked about the platform\nin his high-heeled boots, looking for our trunks, I saw that he was a\nrather slight man, quick and wiry, and light on his feet. He told us we\nhad a long night drive ahead of us, and had better be on the hike. He\nled us to a hitching-bar where two farm-wagons were tied, and I saw the\nforeign family crowding into one of them. The other was for us. Jake got\non the front seat with Otto Fuchs, and I rode on the straw in the bottom\nof the wagon-box, covered up with a buffalo hide. The immigrants rumbled\noff into the empty darkness, and we followed them.\n\nI tried to go to sleep, but the jolting made me bite my tongue, and I\nsoon began to ache all over. When the straw settled down, I had a hard\nbed. Cautiously I slipped from under the buffalo hide, got up on my\nknees and peered over the side of the wagon. There seemed to be nothing\nto see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or fields. If there\nwas a road, I could not make it out in the faint starlight. There was\nnothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which\ncountries are made. No, there was nothing but land--slightly undulating,\nI knew, because often our wheels ground against the brake as we went\ndown into a hollow and lurched up again on the other side. I had the\nfeeling that the world was left behind, that we had got over the edge of\nit, and were outside man’s jurisdiction. I had never before looked up\nat the sky when there was not a familiar mountain ridge against it. But\nthis was the complete dome of heaven, all there was of it. I did not\nbelieve that my dead father and mother were watching me from up there;\nthey would still be looking for me at the sheep-fold down by the creek,\nor along the white road that led to the mountain pastures. I had left\neven their spirits behind me. The wagon jolted on, carrying me I knew\nnot whither. I don’t think I was homesick. If we never arrived anywhere,\nit did not matter. Between that earth and that sky I felt erased,\nblotted out. I did not say my prayers that night: here, I felt, what\nwould be would be.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nI DO NOT REMEMBER our arrival at my grandfather’s farm sometime before\ndaybreak, after a drive of nearly twenty miles with heavy work-horses.\nWhen I awoke, it was afternoon. I was lying in a little room, scarcely\nlarger than the bed that held me, and the window-shade at my head was\nflapping softly in a warm wind. A tall woman, with wrinkled brown skin\nand black hair, stood looking down at me; I knew that she must be my\ngrandmother. She had been crying, I could see, but when I opened my eyes\nshe smiled, peered at me anxiously, and sat down on the foot of my bed.\n\n‘Had a good sleep, Jimmy?’ she asked briskly. Then in a very different\ntone she said, as if to herself, ‘My, how you do look like your father!’\nI remembered that my father had been her little boy; she must often\nhave come to wake him like this when he overslept. ‘Here are your clean\nclothes,’ she went on, stroking my coverlid with her brown hand as she\ntalked. ‘But first you come down to the kitchen with me, and have a nice\nwarm bath behind the stove. Bring your things; there’s nobody about.’\n\n‘Down to the kitchen’ struck me as curious; it was always ‘out in the\nkitchen’ at home. I picked up my shoes and stockings and followed her\nthrough the living-room and down a flight of stairs into a basement.\nThis basement was divided into a dining-room at the right of the\nstairs and a kitchen at the left. Both rooms were plastered and\nwhitewashed--the plaster laid directly upon the earth walls, as it used\nto be in dugouts. The floor was of hard cement. Up under the wooden\nceiling there were little half-windows with white curtains, and pots of\ngeraniums and wandering Jew in the deep sills. As I entered the kitchen,\nI sniffed a pleasant smell of gingerbread baking. The stove was very\nlarge, with bright nickel trimmings, and behind it there was a long\nwooden bench against the wall, and a tin washtub, into which grandmother\npoured hot and cold water. When she brought the soap and towels, I told\nher that I was used to taking my bath without help. ‘Can you do your\nears, Jimmy? Are you sure? Well, now, I call you a right smart little\nboy.’\n\nIt was pleasant there in the kitchen. The sun shone into my bath-water\nthrough the west half-window, and a big Maltese cat came up and rubbed\nhimself against the tub, watching me curiously. While I scrubbed, my\ngrandmother busied herself in the dining-room until I called anxiously,\n‘Grandmother, I’m afraid the cakes are burning!’ Then she came laughing,\nwaving her apron before her as if she were shooing chickens.\n\nShe was a spare, tall woman, a little stooped, and she was apt to carry\nher head thrust forward in an attitude of attention, as if she were\nlooking at something, or listening to something, far away. As I grew\nolder, I came to believe that it was only because she was so often\nthinking of things that were far away. She was quick-footed and\nenergetic in all her movements. Her voice was high and rather shrill,\nand she often spoke with an anxious inflection, for she was exceedingly\ndesirous that everything should go with due order and decorum. Her\nlaugh, too, was high, and perhaps a little strident, but there was a\nlively intelligence in it. She was then fifty-five years old, a strong\nwoman, of unusual endurance.\n\nAfter I was dressed, I explored the long cellar next the kitchen. It was\ndug out under the wing of the house, was plastered and cemented, with a\nstairway and an outside door by which the men came and went. Under one\nof the windows there was a place for them to wash when they came in from\nwork.\n\n\nWhile my grandmother was busy about supper, I settled myself on the\nwooden bench behind the stove and got acquainted with the cat--he caught\nnot only rats and mice, but gophers, I was told. The patch of\nyellow sunlight on the floor travelled back toward the stairway, and\ngrandmother and I talked about my journey, and about the arrival of the\nnew Bohemian family; she said they were to be our nearest neighbours. We\ndid not talk about the farm in Virginia, which had been her home for so\nmany years. But after the men came in from the fields, and we were all\nseated at the supper table, then she asked Jake about the old place and\nabout our friends and neighbours there.\n\nMy grandfather said little. When he first came in he kissed me and\nspoke kindly to me, but he was not demonstrative. I felt at once his\ndeliberateness and personal dignity, and was a little in awe of him.\nThe thing one immediately noticed about him was his beautiful, crinkly,\nsnow-white beard. I once heard a missionary say it was like the beard of\nan Arabian sheik. His bald crown only made it more impressive.\n\nGrandfather’s eyes were not at all like those of an old man; they were\nbright blue, and had a fresh, frosty sparkle. His teeth were white and\nregular--so sound that he had never been to a dentist in his life. He\nhad a delicate skin, easily roughened by sun and wind. When he was a\nyoung man his hair and beard were red; his eyebrows were still coppery.\n\nAs we sat at the table, Otto Fuchs and I kept stealing covert glances at\neach other. Grandmother had told me while she was getting supper that\nhe was an Austrian who came to this country a young boy and had led an\nadventurous life in the Far West among mining-camps and cow outfits. His\niron constitution was somewhat broken by mountain pneumonia, and he had\ndrifted back to live in a milder country for a while. He had relatives\nin Bismarck, a German settlement to the north of us, but for a year now\nhe had been working for grandfather.\n\nThe minute supper was over, Otto took me into the kitchen to whisper to\nme about a pony down in the barn that had been bought for me at a sale;\nhe had been riding him to find out whether he had any bad tricks, but\nhe was a ‘perfect gentleman,’ and his name was Dude. Fuchs told me\neverything I wanted to know: how he had lost his ear in a Wyoming\nblizzard when he was a stage-driver, and how to throw a lasso. He\npromised to rope a steer for me before sundown next day. He got out\nhis ‘chaps’ and silver spurs to show them to Jake and me, and his best\ncowboy boots, with tops stitched in bold design--roses, and true-lover’s\nknots, and undraped female figures. These, he solemnly explained, were\nangels.\n\nBefore we went to bed, Jake and Otto were called up to the living-room\nfor prayers. Grandfather put on silver-rimmed spectacles and\nread several Psalms. His voice was so sympathetic and he read so\ninterestingly that I wished he had chosen one of my favourite chapters\nin the Book of Kings. I was awed by his intonation of the word ‘Selah.’\n‘He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom\nHe loved. Selah.’ I had no idea what the word meant; perhaps he had not.\nBut, as he uttered it, it became oracular, the most sacred of words.\n\nEarly the next morning I ran out-of-doors to look about me. I had been\ntold that ours was the only wooden house west of Black Hawk--until\nyou came to the Norwegian settlement, where there were several. Our\nneighbours lived in sod houses and dugouts--comfortable, but not very\nroomy. Our white frame house, with a storey and half-storey above the\nbasement, stood at the east end of what I might call the farmyard, with\nthe windmill close by the kitchen door. From the windmill the ground\nsloped westward, down to the barns and granaries and pig-yards. This\nslope was trampled hard and bare, and washed out in winding gullies by\nthe rain. Beyond the corncribs, at the bottom of the shallow draw, was\na muddy little pond, with rusty willow bushes growing about it. The road\nfrom the post-office came directly by our door, crossed the farmyard,\nand curved round this little pond, beyond which it began to climb the\ngentle swell of unbroken prairie to the west. There, along the western\nsky-line it skirted a great cornfield, much larger than any field I had\never seen. This cornfield, and the sorghum patch behind the barn, were\nthe only broken land in sight. Everywhere, as far as the eye could\nreach, there was nothing but rough, shaggy, red grass, most of it as\ntall as I.\n\nNorth of the house, inside the ploughed fire-breaks, grew a thick-set\nstrip of box-elder trees, low and bushy, their leaves already turning\nyellow. This hedge was nearly a quarter of a mile long, but I had to\nlook very hard to see it at all. The little trees were insignificant\nagainst the grass. It seemed as if the grass were about to run over\nthem, and over the plum-patch behind the sod chicken-house.\n\nAs I looked about me I felt that the grass was the country, as the water\nis the sea. The red of the grass made all the great prairie the colour\nof winestains, or of certain seaweeds when they are first washed up. And\nthere was so much motion in it; the whole country seemed, somehow, to be\nrunning.\n\nI had almost forgotten that I had a grandmother, when she came out, her\nsunbonnet on her head, a grain-sack in her hand, and asked me if I did\nnot want to go to the garden with her to dig potatoes for dinner.\n\nThe garden, curiously enough, was a quarter of a mile from the house,\nand the way to it led up a shallow draw past the cattle corral.\nGrandmother called my attention to a stout hickory cane, tipped with\ncopper, which hung by a leather thong from her belt. This, she said,\nwas her rattlesnake cane. I must never go to the garden without a heavy\nstick or a corn-knife; she had killed a good many rattlers on her way\nback and forth. A little girl who lived on the Black Hawk road was\nbitten on the ankle and had been sick all summer.\n\nI can remember exactly how the country looked to me as I walked beside\nmy grandmother along the faint wagon-tracks on that early September\nmorning. Perhaps the glide of long railway travel was still with me, for\nmore than anything else I felt motion in the landscape; in the fresh,\neasy-blowing morning wind, and in the earth itself, as if the shaggy\ngrass were a sort of loose hide, and underneath it herds of wild buffalo\nwere galloping, galloping...\n\nAlone, I should never have found the garden--except, perhaps, for\nthe big yellow pumpkins that lay about unprotected by their withering\nvines--and I felt very little interest in it when I got there. I wanted\nto walk straight on through the red grass and over the edge of the\nworld, which could not be very far away. The light air about me told me\nthat the world ended here: only the ground and sun and sky were left,\nand if one went a little farther there would be only sun and sky, and\none would float off into them, like the tawny hawks which sailed over\nour heads making slow shadows on the grass. While grandmother took the\npitchfork we found standing in one of the rows and dug potatoes, while I\npicked them up out of the soft brown earth and put them into the bag, I\nkept looking up at the hawks that were doing what I might so easily do.\n\nWhen grandmother was ready to go, I said I would like to stay up there\nin the garden awhile.\n\nShe peered down at me from under her sunbonnet. ‘Aren’t you afraid of\nsnakes?’\n\n‘A little,’ I admitted, ‘but I’d like to stay, anyhow.’\n\n‘Well, if you see one, don’t have anything to do with him. The big\nyellow and brown ones won’t hurt you; they’re bull-snakes and help to\nkeep the gophers down. Don’t be scared if you see anything look out of\nthat hole in the bank over there. That’s a badger hole. He’s about as\nbig as a big ‘possum, and his face is striped, black and white. He takes\na chicken once in a while, but I won’t let the men harm him. In a new\ncountry a body feels friendly to the animals. I like to have him come\nout and watch me when I’m at work.’\n\nGrandmother swung the bag of potatoes over her shoulder and went down\nthe path, leaning forward a little. The road followed the windings\nof the draw; when she came to the first bend, she waved at me and\ndisappeared. I was left alone with this new feeling of lightness and\ncontent.\n\nI sat down in the middle of the garden, where snakes could scarcely\napproach unseen, and leaned my back against a warm yellow pumpkin. There\nwere some ground-cherry bushes growing along the furrows, full of fruit.\nI turned back the papery triangular sheaths that protected the berries\nand ate a few. All about me giant grasshoppers, twice as big as any I\nhad ever seen, were doing acrobatic feats among the dried vines. The\ngophers scurried up and down the ploughed ground. There in the sheltered\ndraw-bottom the wind did not blow very hard, but I could hear it singing\nits humming tune up on the level, and I could see the tall grasses\nwave. The earth was warm under me, and warm as I crumbled it through\nmy fingers. Queer little red bugs came out and moved in slow squadrons\naround me. Their backs were polished vermilion, with black spots. I\nkept as still as I could. Nothing happened. I did not expect anything\nto happen. I was something that lay under the sun and felt it, like the\npumpkins, and I did not want to be anything more. I was entirely happy.\nPerhaps we feel like that when we die and become a part of something\nentire, whether it is sun and air, or goodness and knowledge. At any\nrate, that is happiness; to be dissolved into something complete and\ngreat. When it comes to one, it comes as naturally as sleep.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nON SUNDAY MORNING Otto Fuchs was to drive us over to make the\nacquaintance of our new Bohemian neighbours. We were taking them some\nprovisions, as they had come to live on a wild place where there was no\ngarden or chicken-house, and very little broken land. Fuchs brought up\na sack of potatoes and a piece of cured pork from the cellar, and\ngrandmother packed some loaves of Saturday’s bread, a jar of butter, and\nseveral pumpkin pies in the straw of the wagon-box. We clambered up to\nthe front seat and jolted off past the little pond and along the road\nthat climbed to the big cornfield.\n\nI could hardly wait to see what lay beyond that cornfield; but there\nwas only red grass like ours, and nothing else, though from the high\nwagon-seat one could look off a long way. The road ran about like a wild\nthing, avoiding the deep draws, crossing them where they were wide and\nshallow. And all along it, wherever it looped or ran, the sunflowers\ngrew; some of them were as big as little trees, with great rough leaves\nand many branches which bore dozens of blossoms. They made a gold ribbon\nacross the prairie. Occasionally one of the horses would tear off with\nhis teeth a plant full of blossoms, and walk along munching it, the\nflowers nodding in time to his bites as he ate down toward them.\n\nThe Bohemian family, grandmother told me as we drove along, had bought\nthe homestead of a fellow countryman, Peter Krajiek, and had paid him\nmore than it was worth. Their agreement with him was made before they\nleft the old country, through a cousin of his, who was also a relative\nof Mrs. Shimerda. The Shimerdas were the first Bohemian family to come\nto this part of the county. Krajiek was their only interpreter, and\ncould tell them anything he chose. They could not speak enough English\nto ask for advice, or even to make their most pressing wants known. One\nson, Fuchs said, was well-grown, and strong enough to work the land; but\nthe father was old and frail and knew nothing about farming. He was a\nweaver by trade; had been a skilled workman on tapestries and upholstery\nmaterials. He had brought his fiddle with him, which wouldn’t be of much\nuse here, though he used to pick up money by it at home.\n\n‘If they’re nice people, I hate to think of them spending the winter in\nthat cave of Krajiek’s,’ said grandmother. ‘It’s no better than a badger\nhole; no proper dugout at all. And I hear he’s made them pay twenty\ndollars for his old cookstove that ain’t worth ten.’\n\n‘Yes’m,’ said Otto; ‘and he’s sold ‘em his oxen and his two bony old\nhorses for the price of good workteams. I’d have interfered about the\nhorses--the old man can understand some German--if I’d I a’ thought it\nwould do any good. But Bohemians has a natural distrust of Austrians.’\n\nGrandmother looked interested. ‘Now, why is that, Otto?’\n\nFuchs wrinkled his brow and nose. ‘Well, ma’m, it’s politics. It would\ntake me a long while to explain.’\n\nThe land was growing rougher; I was told that we were approaching Squaw\nCreek, which cut up the west half of the Shimerdas’ place and made the\nland of little value for farming. Soon we could see the broken,\ngrassy clay cliffs which indicated the windings of the stream, and the\nglittering tops of the cottonwoods and ash trees that grew down in\nthe ravine. Some of the cottonwoods had already turned, and the yellow\nleaves and shining white bark made them look like the gold and silver\ntrees in fairy tales.\n\nAs we approached the Shimerdas’ dwelling, I could still see nothing but\nrough red hillocks, and draws with shelving banks and long roots hanging\nout where the earth had crumbled away. Presently, against one of those\nbanks, I saw a sort of shed, thatched with the same wine-coloured grass\nthat grew everywhere. Near it tilted a shattered windmill frame, that\nhad no wheel. We drove up to this skeleton to tie our horses, and then\nI saw a door and window sunk deep in the drawbank. The door stood\nopen, and a woman and a girl of fourteen ran out and looked up at us\nhopefully. A little girl trailed along behind them. The woman had on her\nhead the same embroidered shawl with silk fringes that she wore when she\nhad alighted from the train at Black Hawk. She was not old, but she was\ncertainly not young. Her face was alert and lively, with a sharp chin\nand shrewd little eyes. She shook grandmother’s hand energetically.\n\n‘Very glad, very glad!’ she ejaculated. Immediately she pointed to the\nbank out of which she had emerged and said, ‘House no good, house no\ngood!’\n\nGrandmother nodded consolingly. ‘You’ll get fixed up comfortable after\nwhile, Mrs. Shimerda; make good house.’\n\nMy grandmother always spoke in a very loud tone to foreigners, as if\nthey were deaf. She made Mrs. Shimerda understand the friendly intention\nof our visit, and the Bohemian woman handled the loaves of bread\nand even smelled them, and examined the pies with lively curiosity,\nexclaiming, ‘Much good, much thank!’--and again she wrung grandmother’s\nhand.\n\nThe oldest son, Ambroz--they called it Ambrosch--came out of the cave\nand stood beside his mother. He was nineteen years old, short and\nbroad-backed, with a close-cropped, flat head, and a wide, flat face.\nHis hazel eyes were little and shrewd, like his mother’s, but more sly\nand suspicious; they fairly snapped at the food. The family had been\nliving on corncakes and sorghum molasses for three days.\n\nThe little girl was pretty, but Antonia--they accented the name thus,\nstrongly, when they spoke to her--was still prettier. I remembered what\nthe conductor had said about her eyes. They were big and warm and full\nof light, like the sun shining on brown pools in the wood. Her skin was\nbrown, too, and in her cheeks she had a glow of rich, dark colour. Her\nbrown hair was curly and wild-looking. The little sister, whom they\ncalled Yulka (Julka), was fair, and seemed mild and obedient. While I\nstood awkwardly confronting the two girls, Krajiek came up from the barn\nto see what was going on. With him was another Shimerda son. Even from a\ndistance one could see that there was something strange about this boy.\nAs he approached us, he began to make uncouth noises, and held up his\nhands to show us his fingers, which were webbed to the first knuckle,\nlike a duck’s foot. When he saw me draw back, he began to crow\ndelightedly, ‘Hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo!’ like a rooster. His mother scowled\nand said sternly, ‘Marek!’ then spoke rapidly to Krajiek in Bohemian.\n\n‘She wants me to tell you he won’t hurt nobody, Mrs. Burden. He was\nborn like that. The others are smart. Ambrosch, he make good farmer.’ He\nstruck Ambrosch on the back, and the boy smiled knowingly.\n\nAt that moment the father came out of the hole in the bank. He wore no\nhat, and his thick, iron-grey hair was brushed straight back from his\nforehead. It was so long that it bushed out behind his ears, and made\nhim look like the old portraits I remembered in Virginia. He was\ntall and slender, and his thin shoulders stooped. He looked at us\nunderstandingly, then took grandmother’s hand and bent over it. I\nnoticed how white and well-shaped his own hands were. They looked calm,\nsomehow, and skilled. His eyes were melancholy, and were set back\ndeep under his brow. His face was ruggedly formed, but it looked like\nashes--like something from which all the warmth and light had died out.\nEverything about this old man was in keeping with his dignified manner.\nHe was neatly dressed. Under his coat he wore a knitted grey vest, and,\ninstead of a collar, a silk scarf of a dark bronze-green, carefully\ncrossed and held together by a red coral pin. While Krajiek was\ntranslating for Mr. Shimerda, Antonia came up to me and held out her\nhand coaxingly. In a moment we were running up the steep drawside\ntogether, Yulka trotting after us.\n\nWhen we reached the level and could see the gold tree-tops, I pointed\ntoward them, and Antonia laughed and squeezed my hand as if to tell me\nhow glad she was I had come. We raced off toward Squaw Creek and did not\nstop until the ground itself stopped--fell away before us so abruptly\nthat the next step would have been out into the tree-tops. We stood\npanting on the edge of the ravine, looking down at the trees and bushes\nthat grew below us. The wind was so strong that I had to hold my hat on,\nand the girls’ skirts were blown out before them. Antonia seemed to like\nit; she held her little sister by the hand and chattered away in that\nlanguage which seemed to me spoken so much more rapidly than mine. She\nlooked at me, her eyes fairly blazing with things she could not say.\n\n‘Name? What name?’ she asked, touching me on the shoulder. I told her\nmy name, and she repeated it after me and made Yulka say it. She pointed\ninto the gold cottonwood tree behind whose top we stood and said again,\n‘What name?’\n\nWe sat down and made a nest in the long red grass. Yulka curled up like\na baby rabbit and played with a grasshopper. Antonia pointed up to the\nsky and questioned me with her glance. I gave her the word, but she was\nnot satisfied and pointed to my eyes. I told her, and she repeated the\nword, making it sound like ‘ice.’ She pointed up to the sky, then to my\neyes, then back to the sky, with movements so quick and impulsive that\nshe distracted me, and I had no idea what she wanted. She got up on her\nknees and wrung her hands. She pointed to her own eyes and shook her\nhead, then to mine and to the sky, nodding violently.\n\n‘Oh,’ I exclaimed, ‘blue; blue sky.’\n\nShe clapped her hands and murmured, ‘Blue sky, blue eyes,’ as if it\namused her. While we snuggled down there out of the wind, she learned\na score of words. She was alive, and very eager. We were so deep in the\ngrass that we could see nothing but the blue sky over us and the gold\ntree in front of us. It was wonderfully pleasant. After Antonia had\nsaid the new words over and over, she wanted to give me a little chased\nsilver ring she wore on her middle finger. When she coaxed and insisted,\nI repulsed her quite sternly. I didn’t want her ring, and I felt there\nwas something reckless and extravagant about her wishing to give it away\nto a boy she had never seen before. No wonder Krajiek got the better of\nthese people, if this was how they behaved.\n\nWhile we were disputing ‘about the ring, I heard a mournful voice\ncalling, ‘Antonia, Antonia!’ She sprang up like a hare. ‘Tatinek!\nTatinek!’ she shouted, and we ran to meet the old man who was coming\ntoward us. Antonia reached him first, took his hand and kissed it. When\nI came up, he touched my shoulder and looked searchingly down into my\nface for several seconds. I became somewhat embarrassed, for I was used\nto being taken for granted by my elders.\n\nWe went with Mr. Shimerda back to the dugout, where grandmother was\nwaiting for me. Before I got into the wagon, he took a book out of his\npocket, opened it, and showed me a page with two alphabets, one English\nand the other Bohemian. He placed this book in my grandmother’s hands,\nlooked at her entreatingly, and said, with an earnestness which I shall\nnever forget, ‘Te-e-ach, te-e-ach my Antonia!’\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nON THE AFTERNOON of that same Sunday I took my first long ride on my\npony, under Otto’s direction. After that Dude and I went twice a week to\nthe post-office, six miles east of us, and I saved the men a good deal\nof time by riding on errands to our neighbours. When we had to borrow\nanything, or to send about word that there would be preaching at the sod\nschoolhouse, I was always the messenger. Formerly Fuchs attended to such\nthings after working hours.\n\nAll the years that have passed have not dimmed my memory of that first\nglorious autumn. The new country lay open before me: there were no\nfences in those days, and I could choose my own way over the grass\nuplands, trusting the pony to get me home again. Sometimes I followed\nthe sunflower-bordered roads. Fuchs told me that the sunflowers were\nintroduced into that country by the Mormons; that at the time of the\npersecution, when they left Missouri and struck out into the wilderness\nto find a place where they could worship God in their own way, the\nmembers of the first exploring party, crossing the plains to Utah,\nscattered sunflower seed as they went. The next summer, when the long\ntrains of wagons came through with all the women and children, they had\nthe sunflower trail to follow. I believe that botanists do not confirm\nFuchs’s story, but insist that the sunflower was native to those plains.\nNevertheless, that legend has stuck in my mind, and sunflower-bordered\nroads always seem to me the roads to freedom.\n\nI used to love to drift along the pale-yellow cornfields, looking for\nthe damp spots one sometimes found at their edges, where the smartweed\nsoon turned a rich copper colour and the narrow brown leaves hung curled\nlike cocoons about the swollen joints of the stem. Sometimes I went\nsouth to visit our German neighbours and to admire their catalpa grove,\nor to see the big elm tree that grew up out of a deep crack in the\nearth and had a hawk’s nest in its branches. Trees were so rare in that\ncountry, and they had to make such a hard fight to grow, that we used to\nfeel anxious about them, and visit them as if they were persons. It\nmust have been the scarcity of detail in that tawny landscape that made\ndetail so precious.\n\nSometimes I rode north to the big prairie-dog town to watch the brown\nearth-owls fly home in the late afternoon and go down to their nests\nunderground with the dogs. Antonia Shimerda liked to go with me, and we\nused to wonder a great deal about these birds of subterranean habit.\nWe had to be on our guard there, for rattlesnakes were always lurking\nabout. They came to pick up an easy living among the dogs and owls,\nwhich were quite defenceless against them; took possession of their\ncomfortable houses and ate the eggs and puppies. We felt sorry for the\nowls. It was always mournful to see them come flying home at sunset and\ndisappear under the earth. But, after all, we felt, winged things who\nwould live like that must be rather degraded creatures. The dog-town was\na long way from any pond or creek. Otto Fuchs said he had seen populous\ndog-towns in the desert where there was no surface water for fifty\nmiles; he insisted that some of the holes must go down to water--nearly\ntwo hundred feet, hereabouts. Antonia said she didn’t believe it; that\nthe dogs probably lapped up the dew in the early morning, like the\nrabbits.\n\nAntonia had opinions about everything, and she was soon able to make\nthem known. Almost every day she came running across the prairie to have\nher reading lesson with me. Mrs. Shimerda grumbled, but realized it was\nimportant that one member of the family should learn English. When the\nlesson was over, we used to go up to the watermelon patch behind the\ngarden. I split the melons with an old corn-knife, and we lifted out the\nhearts and ate them with the juice trickling through our fingers.\nThe white Christmas melons we did not touch, but we watched them with\ncuriosity. They were to be picked late, when the hard frosts had set\nin, and put away for winter use. After weeks on the ocean, the Shimerdas\nwere famished for fruit. The two girls would wander for miles along the\nedge of the cornfields, hunting for ground-cherries.\n\nAntonia loved to help grandmother in the kitchen and to learn about\ncooking and housekeeping. She would stand beside her, watching her\nevery movement. We were willing to believe that Mrs. Shimerda was a\ngood housewife in her own country, but she managed poorly under new\nconditions: the conditions were bad enough, certainly!\n\nI remember how horrified we were at the sour, ashy-grey bread she gave\nher family to eat. She mixed her dough, we discovered, in an old tin\npeck-measure that Krajiek had used about the barn. When she took the\npaste out to bake it, she left smears of dough sticking to the sides of\nthe measure, put the measure on the shelf behind the stove, and let this\nresidue ferment. The next time she made bread, she scraped this sour\nstuff down into the fresh dough to serve as yeast.\n\nDuring those first months the Shimerdas never went to town. Krajiek\nencouraged them in the belief that in Black Hawk they would somehow be\nmysteriously separated from their money. They hated Krajiek, but they\nclung to him because he was the only human being with whom they could\ntalk or from whom they could get information. He slept with the old man\nand the two boys in the dugout barn, along with the oxen. They kept him\nin their hole and fed him for the same reason that the prairie-dogs and\nthe brown owls house the rattlesnakes--because they did not know how to\nget rid of him.\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nWE KNEW THAT THINGS were hard for our Bohemian neighbours, but the two\ngirls were lighthearted and never complained. They were always ready to\nforget their troubles at home, and to run away with me over the prairie,\nscaring rabbits or starting up flocks of quail.\n\nI remember Antonia’s excitement when she came into our kitchen one\nafternoon and announced: ‘My papa find friends up north, with Russian\nmans. Last night he take me for see, and I can understand very much\ntalk. Nice mans, Mrs. Burden. One is fat and all the time laugh.\nEverybody laugh. The first time I see my papa laugh in this kawntree.\nOh, very nice!’\n\nI asked her if she meant the two Russians who lived up by the big\ndog-town. I had often been tempted to go to see them when I was riding\nin that direction, but one of them was a wild-looking fellow and I was\na little afraid of him. Russia seemed to me more remote than any other\ncountry--farther away than China, almost as far as the North Pole. Of\nall the strange, uprooted people among the first settlers, those two\nmen were the strangest and the most aloof. Their last names were\nunpronounceable, so they were called Pavel and Peter. They went about\nmaking signs to people, and until the Shimerdas came they had no\nfriends. Krajiek could understand them a little, but he had cheated them\nin a trade, so they avoided him. Pavel, the tall one, was said to be an\nanarchist; since he had no means of imparting his opinions, probably his\nwild gesticulations and his generally excited and rebellious manner gave\nrise to this supposition. He must once have been a very strong man, but\nnow his great frame, with big, knotty joints, had a wasted look, and the\nskin was drawn tight over his high cheekbones. His breathing was hoarse,\nand he always had a cough.\n\nPeter, his companion, was a very different sort of fellow; short,\nbow-legged, and as fat as butter. He always seemed pleased when he met\npeople on the road, smiled and took off his cap to everyone, men as well\nas women. At a distance, on his wagon, he looked like an old man; his\nhair and beard were of such a pale flaxen colour that they seemed white\nin the sun. They were as thick and curly as carded wool. His rosy face,\nwith its snub nose, set in this fleece, was like a melon among its\nleaves. He was usually called ‘Curly Peter,’ or ‘Rooshian Peter.’\n\nThe two Russians made good farm-hands, and in summer they worked out\ntogether. I had heard our neighbours laughing when they told how\nPeter always had to go home at night to milk his cow. Other bachelor\nhomesteaders used canned milk, to save trouble. Sometimes Peter came to\nchurch at the sod schoolhouse. It was there I first saw him, sitting\non a low bench by the door, his plush cap in his hands, his bare feet\ntucked apologetically under the seat.\n\nAfter Mr. Shimerda discovered the Russians, he went to see them almost\nevery evening, and sometimes took Antonia with him. She said they came\nfrom a part of Russia where the language was not very different from\nBohemian, and if I wanted to go to their place, she could talk to them\nfor me. One afternoon, before the heavy frosts began, we rode up there\ntogether on my pony.\n\nThe Russians had a neat log house built on a grassy slope, with a\nwindlass well beside the door. As we rode up the draw, we skirted a big\nmelon patch, and a garden where squashes and yellow cucumbers lay\nabout on the sod. We found Peter out behind his kitchen, bending over\na washtub. He was working so hard that he did not hear us coming. His\nwhole body moved up and down as he rubbed, and he was a funny sight\nfrom the rear, with his shaggy head and bandy legs. When he straightened\nhimself up to greet us, drops of perspiration were rolling from his\nthick nose down onto his curly beard. Peter dried his hands and seemed\nglad to leave his washing. He took us down to see his chickens, and\nhis cow that was grazing on the hillside. He told Antonia that in his\ncountry only rich people had cows, but here any man could have one who\nwould take care of her. The milk was good for Pavel, who was often sick,\nand he could make butter by beating sour cream with a wooden spoon.\nPeter was very fond of his cow. He patted her flanks and talked to her\nin Russian while he pulled up her lariat pin and set it in a new place.\n\nAfter he had shown us his garden, Peter trundled a load of watermelons\nup the hill in his wheelbarrow. Pavel was not at home. He was off\nsomewhere helping to dig a well. The house I thought very comfortable\nfor two men who were ‘batching.’ Besides the kitchen, there was a\nliving-room, with a wide double bed built against the wall, properly\nmade up with blue gingham sheets and pillows. There was a little\nstoreroom, too, with a window, where they kept guns and saddles and\ntools, and old coats and boots. That day the floor was covered with\ngarden things, drying for winter; corn and beans and fat yellow\ncucumbers. There were no screens or window-blinds in the house, and all\nthe doors and windows stood wide open, letting in flies and sunshine\nalike.\n\nPeter put the melons in a row on the oilcloth-covered table and stood\nover them, brandishing a butcher knife. Before the blade got fairly into\nthem, they split of their own ripeness, with a delicious sound. He gave\nus knives, but no plates, and the top of the table was soon swimming\nwith juice and seeds. I had never seen anyone eat so many melons as\nPeter ate. He assured us that they were good for one--better than\nmedicine; in his country people lived on them at this time of year. He\nwas very hospitable and jolly. Once, while he was looking at Antonia,\nhe sighed and told us that if he had stayed at home in Russia perhaps\nby this time he would have had a pretty daughter of his own to cook and\nkeep house for him. He said he had left his country because of a ‘great\ntrouble.’\n\nWhen we got up to go, Peter looked about in perplexity for something\nthat would entertain us. He ran into the storeroom and brought out a\ngaudily painted harmonica, sat down on a bench, and spreading his fat\nlegs apart began to play like a whole band. The tunes were either very\nlively or very doleful, and he sang words to some of them.\n\nBefore we left, Peter put ripe cucumbers into a sack for Mrs. Shimerda\nand gave us a lard-pail full of milk to cook them in. I had never heard\nof cooking cucumbers, but Antonia assured me they were very good. We had\nto walk the pony all the way home to keep from spilling the milk.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nONE AFTERNOON WE WERE having our reading lesson on the warm, grassy bank\nwhere the badger lived. It was a day of amber sunlight, but there was\na shiver of coming winter in the air. I had seen ice on the little\nhorsepond that morning, and as we went through the garden we found the\ntall asparagus, with its red berries, lying on the ground, a mass of\nslimy green.\n\nTony was barefooted, and she shivered in her cotton dress and was\ncomfortable only when we were tucked down on the baked earth, in the\nfull blaze of the sun. She could talk to me about almost anything by\nthis time. That afternoon she was telling me how highly esteemed our\nfriend the badger was in her part of the world, and how men kept a\nspecial kind of dog, with very short legs, to hunt him. Those dogs, she\nsaid, went down into the hole after the badger and killed him there in\na terrific struggle underground; you could hear the barks and yelps\noutside. Then the dog dragged himself back, covered with bites and\nscratches, to be rewarded and petted by his master. She knew a dog who\nhad a star on his collar for every badger he had killed.\n\nThe rabbits were unusually spry that afternoon. They kept starting up\nall about us, and dashing off down the draw as if they were playing a\ngame of some kind. But the little buzzing things that lived in the grass\nwere all dead--all but one. While we were lying there against the warm\nbank, a little insect of the palest, frailest green hopped painfully\nout of the buffalo grass and tried to leap into a bunch of bluestem. He\nmissed it, fell back, and sat with his head sunk between his long legs,\nhis antennae quivering, as if he were waiting for something to come and\nfinish him. Tony made a warm nest for him in her hands; talked to him\ngaily and indulgently in Bohemian. Presently he began to sing for us--a\nthin, rusty little chirp. She held him close to her ear and laughed, but\na moment afterward I saw there were tears in her eyes. She told me that\nin her village at home there was an old beggar woman who went about\nselling herbs and roots she had dug up in the forest. If you took her\nin and gave her a warm place by the fire, she sang old songs to the\nchildren in a cracked voice, like this. Old Hata, she was called, and\nthe children loved to see her coming and saved their cakes and sweets\nfor her.\n\nWhen the bank on the other side of the draw began to throw a narrow\nshelf of shadow, we knew we ought to be starting homeward; the chill\ncame on quickly when the sun got low, and Antonia’s dress was thin. What\nwere we to do with the frail little creature we had lured back to life\nby false pretences? I offered my pockets, but Tony shook her head and\ncarefully put the green insect in her hair, tying her big handkerchief\ndown loosely over her curls. I said I would go with her until we could\nsee Squaw Creek, and then turn and run home. We drifted along lazily,\nvery happy, through the magical light of the late afternoon.\n\nAll those fall afternoons were the same, but I never got used to them.\nAs far as we could see, the miles of copper-red grass were drenched in\nsunlight that was stronger and fiercer than at any other time of the\nday. The blond cornfields were red gold, the haystacks turned rosy and\nthrew long shadows. The whole prairie was like the bush that burned\nwith fire and was not consumed. That hour always had the exultation\nof victory, of triumphant ending, like a hero’s death--heroes who died\nyoung and gloriously. It was a sudden transfiguration, a lifting-up of\nday.\n\nHow many an afternoon Antonia and I have trailed along the prairie under\nthat magnificence! And always two long black shadows flitted before us\nor followed after, dark spots on the ruddy grass.\n\nWe had been silent a long time, and the edge of the sun sank nearer and\nnearer the prairie floor, when we saw a figure moving on the edge of\nthe upland, a gun over his shoulder. He was walking slowly, dragging his\nfeet along as if he had no purpose. We broke into a run to overtake him.\n\n‘My papa sick all the time,’ Tony panted as we flew. ‘He not look good,\nJim.’\n\nAs we neared Mr. Shimerda she shouted, and he lifted his head and peered\nabout. Tony ran up to him, caught his hand and pressed it against her\ncheek. She was the only one of his family who could rouse the old man\nfrom the torpor in which he seemed to live. He took the bag from his\nbelt and showed us three rabbits he had shot, looked at Antonia with a\nwintry flicker of a smile and began to tell her something. She turned to\nme.\n\n‘My tatinek make me little hat with the skins, little hat for winter!’\nshe exclaimed joyfully. ‘Meat for eat, skin for hat’--she told off these\nbenefits on her fingers.\n\nHer father put his hand on her hair, but she caught his wrist and lifted\nit carefully away, talking to him rapidly. I heard the name of old Hata.\nHe untied the handkerchief, separated her hair with his fingers, and\nstood looking down at the green insect. When it began to chirp faintly,\nhe listened as if it were a beautiful sound.\n\nI picked up the gun he had dropped; a queer piece from the old country,\nshort and heavy, with a stag’s head on the cock. When he saw me\nexamining it, he turned to me with his far-away look that always made\nme feel as if I were down at the bottom of a well. He spoke kindly and\ngravely, and Antonia translated:\n\n‘My tatinek say when you are big boy, he give you his gun. Very fine,\nfrom Bohemie. It was belong to a great man, very rich, like what you not\ngot here; many fields, many forests, many big house. My papa play for\nhis wedding, and he give my papa fine gun, and my papa give you.’\n\nI was glad that this project was one of futurity. There never were such\npeople as the Shimerdas for wanting to give away everything they\nhad. Even the mother was always offering me things, though I knew she\nexpected substantial presents in return. We stood there in friendly\nsilence, while the feeble minstrel sheltered in Antonia’s hair went on\nwith its scratchy chirp. The old man’s smile, as he listened, was so\nfull of sadness, of pity for things, that I never afterward forgot it.\nAs the sun sank there came a sudden coolness and the strong smell of\nearth and drying grass. Antonia and her father went off hand in hand,\nand I buttoned up my jacket and raced my shadow home.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nMUCH AS I LIKED Antonia, I hated a superior tone that she sometimes took\nwith me. She was four years older than I, to be sure, and had seen more\nof the world; but I was a boy and she was a girl, and I resented her\nprotecting manner. Before the autumn was over, she began to treat me\nmore like an equal and to defer to me in other things than reading\nlessons. This change came about from an adventure we had together.\n\nOne day when I rode over to the Shimerdas’ I found Antonia starting off\non foot for Russian Peter’s house, to borrow a spade Ambrosch needed.\nI offered to take her on the pony, and she got up behind me. There had\nbeen another black frost the night before, and the air was clear and\nheady as wine. Within a week all the blooming roads had been despoiled,\nhundreds of miles of yellow sunflowers had been transformed into brown,\nrattling, burry stalks.\n\nWe found Russian Peter digging his potatoes. We were glad to go in and\nget warm by his kitchen stove and to see his squashes and Christmas\nmelons, heaped in the storeroom for winter. As we rode away with the\nspade, Antonia suggested that we stop at the prairie-dog-town and dig\ninto one of the holes. We could find out whether they ran straight\ndown, or were horizontal, like mole-holes; whether they had underground\nconnections; whether the owls had nests down there, lined with feathers.\nWe might get some puppies, or owl eggs, or snakeskins.\n\nThe dog-town was spread out over perhaps ten acres. The grass had been\nnibbled short and even, so this stretch was not shaggy and red like the\nsurrounding country, but grey and velvety. The holes were several yards\napart, and were disposed with a good deal of regularity, almost as if\nthe town had been laid out in streets and avenues. One always felt that\nan orderly and very sociable kind of life was going on there. I picketed\nDude down in a draw, and we went wandering about, looking for a hole\nthat would be easy to dig. The dogs were out, as usual, dozens of them,\nsitting up on their hind legs over the doors of their houses. As\nwe approached, they barked, shook their tails at us, and scurried\nunderground. Before the mouths of the holes were little patches of\nsand and gravel, scratched up, we supposed, from a long way below the\nsurface. Here and there, in the town, we came on larger gravel patches,\nseveral yards away from any hole. If the dogs had scratched the sand up\nin excavating, how had they carried it so far? It was on one of these\ngravel beds that I met my adventure.\n\nWe were examining a big hole with two entrances. The burrow sloped\ninto the ground at a gentle angle, so that we could see where the\ntwo corridors united, and the floor was dusty from use, like a little\nhighway over which much travel went. I was walking backward, in a\ncrouching position, when I heard Antonia scream. She was standing\nopposite me, pointing behind me and shouting something in Bohemian.\nI whirled round, and there, on one of those dry gravel beds, was the\nbiggest snake I had ever seen. He was sunning himself, after the cold\nnight, and he must have been asleep when Antonia screamed. When I\nturned, he was lying in long loose waves, like a letter ‘W.’ He twitched\nand began to coil slowly. He was not merely a big snake, I thought--he\nwas a circus monstrosity. His abominable muscularity, his loathsome,\nfluid motion, somehow made me sick. He was as thick as my leg, and\nlooked as if millstones couldn’t crush the disgusting vitality out\nof him. He lifted his hideous little head, and rattled. I didn’t run\nbecause I didn’t think of it--if my back had been against a stone wall I\ncouldn’t have felt more cornered. I saw his coils tighten--now he would\nspring, spring his length, I remembered. I ran up and drove at his head\nwith my spade, struck him fairly across the neck, and in a minute he\nwas all about my feet in wavy loops. I struck now from hate. Antonia,\nbarefooted as she was, ran up behind me. Even after I had pounded his\nugly head flat, his body kept on coiling and winding, doubling and\nfalling back on itself. I walked away and turned my back. I felt\nseasick.\n\nAntonia came after me, crying, ‘O Jimmy, he not bite you? You sure? Why\nyou not run when I say?’\n\n‘What did you jabber Bohunk for? You might have told me there was a\nsnake behind me!’ I said petulantly.\n\n‘I know I am just awful, Jim, I was so scared.’ She took my handkerchief\nfrom my pocket and tried to wipe my face with it, but I snatched it away\nfrom her. I suppose I looked as sick as I felt.\n\n‘I never know you was so brave, Jim,’ she went on comfortingly. ‘You is\njust like big mans; you wait for him lift his head and then you go for\nhim. Ain’t you feel scared a bit? Now we take that snake home and show\neverybody. Nobody ain’t seen in this kawntree so big snake like you\nkill.’\n\nShe went on in this strain until I began to think that I had longed for\nthis opportunity, and had hailed it with joy. Cautiously we went back to\nthe snake; he was still groping with his tail, turning up his ugly belly\nin the light. A faint, fetid smell came from him, and a thread of green\nliquid oozed from his crushed head.\n\n‘Look, Tony, that’s his poison,’ I said.\n\nI took a long piece of string from my pocket, and she lifted his\nhead with the spade while I tied a noose around it. We pulled him out\nstraight and measured him by my riding-quirt; he was about five and a\nhalf feet long. He had twelve rattles, but they were broken off\nbefore they began to taper, so I insisted that he must once have\nhad twenty-four. I explained to Antonia how this meant that he was\ntwenty-four years old, that he must have been there when white men first\ncame, left on from buffalo and Indian times. As I turned him over, I\nbegan to feel proud of him, to have a kind of respect for his age and\nsize. He seemed like the ancient, eldest Evil. Certainly his kind have\nleft horrible unconscious memories in all warm-blooded life. When we\ndragged him down into the draw, Dude sprang off to the end of his tether\nand shivered all over--wouldn’t let us come near him.\n\nWe decided that Antonia should ride Dude home, and I would walk. As she\nrode along slowly, her bare legs swinging against the pony’s sides,\nshe kept shouting back to me about how astonished everybody would be.\nI followed with the spade over my shoulder, dragging my snake. Her\nexultation was contagious. The great land had never looked to me so big\nand free. If the red grass were full of rattlers, I was equal to them\nall. Nevertheless, I stole furtive glances behind me now and then to see\nthat no avenging mate, older and bigger than my quarry, was racing up\nfrom the rear.\n\nThe sun had set when we reached our garden and went down the draw toward\nthe house. Otto Fuchs was the first one we met. He was sitting on the\nedge of the cattle-pond, having a quiet pipe before supper. Antonia\ncalled him to come quick and look. He did not say anything for a minute,\nbut scratched his head and turned the snake over with his boot.\n\n‘Where did you run onto that beauty, Jim?’\n\n‘Up at the dog-town,’ I answered laconically.\n\n‘Kill him yourself? How come you to have a weepon?’\n\n‘We’d been up to Russian Peter’s, to borrow a spade for Ambrosch.’\n\nOtto shook the ashes out of his pipe and squatted down to count the\nrattles. ‘It was just luck you had a tool,’ he said cautiously. ‘Gosh! I\nwouldn’t want to do any business with that fellow myself, unless I had\na fence-post along. Your grandmother’s snake-cane wouldn’t more than\ntickle him. He could stand right up and talk to you, he could. Did he\nfight hard?’\n\nAntonia broke in: ‘He fight something awful! He is all over Jimmy’s\nboots. I scream for him to run, but he just hit and hit that snake like\nhe was crazy.’\n\nOtto winked at me. After Antonia rode on he said: ‘Got him in the head\nfirst crack, didn’t you? That was just as well.’\n\nWe hung him up to the windmill, and when I went down to the kitchen,\nI found Antonia standing in the middle of the floor, telling the story\nwith a great deal of colour.\n\nSubsequent experiences with rattlesnakes taught me that my first\nencounter was fortunate in circumstance. My big rattler was old, and had\nled too easy a life; there was not much fight in him. He had probably\nlived there for years, with a fat prairie-dog for breakfast whenever he\nfelt like it, a sheltered home, even an owl-feather bed, perhaps, and he\nhad forgot that the world doesn’t owe rattlers a living. A snake of his\nsize, in fighting trim, would be more than any boy could handle. So in\nreality it was a mock adventure; the game was fixed for me by chance, as\nit probably was for many a dragon-slayer. I had been adequately armed by\nRussian Peter; the snake was old and lazy; and I had Antonia beside me,\nto appreciate and admire.\n\nThat snake hung on our corral fence for several days; some of the\nneighbours came to see it and agreed that it was the biggest rattler\never killed in those parts. This was enough for Antonia. She liked me\nbetter from that time on, and she never took a supercilious air with me\nagain. I had killed a big snake--I was now a big fellow.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nWHILE THE AUTUMN COLOUR was growing pale on the grass and cornfields,\nthings went badly with our friends the Russians. Peter told his troubles\nto Mr. Shimerda: he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the\nfirst of November; had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it, and\nto give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow. His\ncreditor was Wick Cutter, the merciless Black Hawk money-lender, a man\nof evil name throughout the county, of whom I shall have more to say\nlater. Peter could give no very clear account of his transactions with\nCutter. He only knew that he had first borrowed two hundred dollars,\nthen another hundred, then fifty--that each time a bonus was added to\nthe principal, and the debt grew faster than any crop he planted. Now\neverything was plastered with mortgages.\n\nSoon after Peter renewed his note, Pavel strained himself lifting\ntimbers for a new barn, and fell over among the shavings with such a\ngush of blood from the lungs that his fellow workmen thought he would\ndie on the spot. They hauled him home and put him into his bed, and\nthere he lay, very ill indeed. Misfortune seemed to settle like an evil\nbird on the roof of the log house, and to flap its wings there, warning\nhuman beings away. The Russians had such bad luck that people were\nafraid of them and liked to put them out of mind.\n\nOne afternoon Antonia and her father came over to our house to get\nbuttermilk, and lingered, as they usually did, until the sun was low.\nJust as they were leaving, Russian Peter drove up. Pavel was very bad,\nhe said, and wanted to talk to Mr. Shimerda and his daughter; he had\ncome to fetch them. When Antonia and her father got into the wagon, I\nentreated grandmother to let me go with them: I would gladly go without\nmy supper, I would sleep in the Shimerdas’ barn and run home in the\nmorning. My plan must have seemed very foolish to her, but she was often\nlarge-minded about humouring the desires of other people. She asked\nPeter to wait a moment, and when she came back from the kitchen she\nbrought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts for us.\n\nMr. Shimerda and Peter were on the front seat; Antonia and I sat in the\nstraw behind and ate our lunch as we bumped along. After the sun sank,\na cold wind sprang up and moaned over the prairie. If this turn in the\nweather had come sooner, I should not have got away. We burrowed down in\nthe straw and curled up close together, watching the angry red die out\nof the west and the stars begin to shine in the clear, windy sky. Peter\nkept sighing and groaning. Tony whispered to me that he was afraid Pavel\nwould never get well. We lay still and did not talk. Up there the stars\ngrew magnificently bright. Though we had come from such different parts\nof the world, in both of us there was some dusky superstition that those\nshining groups have their influence upon what is and what is not to\nbe. Perhaps Russian Peter, come from farther away than any of us, had\nbrought from his land, too, some such belief.\n\nThe little house on the hillside was so much the colour of the night\nthat we could not see it as we came up the draw. The ruddy windows\nguided us--the light from the kitchen stove, for there was no lamp\nburning.\n\nWe entered softly. The man in the wide bed seemed to be asleep. Tony and\nI sat down on the bench by the wall and leaned our arms on the table in\nfront of us. The firelight flickered on the hewn logs that supported\nthe thatch overhead. Pavel made a rasping sound when he breathed, and\nhe kept moaning. We waited. The wind shook the doors and windows\nimpatiently, then swept on again, singing through the big spaces. Each\ngust, as it bore down, rattled the panes, and swelled off like the\nothers. They made me think of defeated armies, retreating; or of ghosts\nwho were trying desperately to get in for shelter, and then went moaning\non. Presently, in one of those sobbing intervals between the blasts,\nthe coyotes tuned up with their whining howl; one, two, three, then\nall together--to tell us that winter was coming. This sound brought an\nanswer from the bed--a long complaining cry--as if Pavel were having bad\ndreams or were waking to some old misery. Peter listened, but did not\nstir. He was sitting on the floor by the kitchen stove. The coyotes\nbroke out again; yap, yap, yap--then the high whine. Pavel called for\nsomething and struggled up on his elbow.\n\n‘He is scared of the wolves,’ Antonia whispered to me. ‘In his country\nthere are very many, and they eat men and women.’ We slid closer\ntogether along the bench.\n\nI could not take my eyes off the man in the bed. His shirt was hanging\nopen, and his emaciated chest, covered with yellow bristle, rose and\nfell horribly. He began to cough. Peter shuffled to his feet, caught up\nthe teakettle and mixed him some hot water and whiskey. The sharp smell\nof spirits went through the room.\n\nPavel snatched the cup and drank, then made Peter give him the bottle\nand slipped it under his pillow, grinning disagreeably, as if he\nhad outwitted someone. His eyes followed Peter about the room with a\ncontemptuous, unfriendly expression. It seemed to me that he despised\nhim for being so simple and docile.\n\nPresently Pavel began to talk to Mr. Shimerda, scarcely above a whisper.\nHe was telling a long story, and as he went on, Antonia took my hand\nunder the table and held it tight. She leaned forward and strained her\nears to hear him. He grew more and more excited, and kept pointing all\naround his bed, as if there were things there and he wanted Mr. Shimerda\nto see them.\n\n\n‘It’s wolves, Jimmy,’ Antonia whispered. ‘It’s awful, what he says!’\n\nThe sick man raged and shook his fist. He seemed to be cursing people\nwho had wronged him. Mr. Shimerda caught him by the shoulders, but could\nhardly hold him in bed. At last he was shut off by a coughing fit which\nfairly choked him. He pulled a cloth from under his pillow and held it\nto his mouth. Quickly it was covered with bright red spots--I thought I\nhad never seen any blood so bright. When he lay down and turned his face\nto the wall, all the rage had gone out of him. He lay patiently fighting\nfor breath, like a child with croup. Antonia’s father uncovered one of\nhis long bony legs and rubbed it rhythmically. From our bench we could\nsee what a hollow case his body was. His spine and shoulder-blades stood\nout like the bones under the hide of a dead steer left in the fields.\nThat sharp backbone must have hurt him when he lay on it.\n\nGradually, relief came to all of us. Whatever it was, the worst was\nover. Mr. Shimerda signed to us that Pavel was asleep. Without a word\nPeter got up and lit his lantern. He was going out to get his team to\ndrive us home. Mr. Shimerda went with him. We sat and watched the long\nbowed back under the blue sheet, scarcely daring to breathe.\n\nOn the way home, when we were lying in the straw, under the jolting and\nrattling Antonia told me as much of the story as she could. What she\ndid not tell me then, she told later; we talked of nothing else for days\nafterward.\n\n\nWhen Pavel and Peter were young men, living at home in Russia, they were\nasked to be groomsmen for a friend who was to marry the belle of another\nvillage. It was in the dead of winter and the groom’s party went over to\nthe wedding in sledges. Peter and Pavel drove in the groom’s sledge, and\nsix sledges followed with all his relatives and friends.\n\nAfter the ceremony at the church, the party went to a dinner given\nby the parents of the bride. The dinner lasted all afternoon; then it\nbecame a supper and continued far into the night. There was much dancing\nand drinking. At midnight the parents of the bride said good-bye to her\nand blessed her. The groom took her up in his arms and carried her out\nto his sledge and tucked her under the blankets. He sprang in beside\nher, and Pavel and Peter (our Pavel and Peter!) took the front\nseat. Pavel drove. The party set out with singing and the jingle of\nsleigh-bells, the groom’s sledge going first. All the drivers were more\nor less the worse for merry-making, and the groom was absorbed in his\nbride.\n\nThe wolves were bad that winter, and everyone knew it, yet when they\nheard the first wolf-cry, the drivers were not much alarmed. They had\ntoo much good food and drink inside them. The first howls were taken\nup and echoed and with quickening repetitions. The wolves were coming\ntogether. There was no moon, but the starlight was clear on the snow. A\nblack drove came up over the hill behind the wedding party. The wolves\nran like streaks of shadow; they looked no bigger than dogs, but there\nwere hundreds of them.\n\n\nSomething happened to the hindmost sledge: the driver lost control--he\nwas probably very drunk--the horses left the road, the sledge was caught\nin a clump of trees, and overturned. The occupants rolled out over the\nsnow, and the fleetest of the wolves sprang upon them. The shrieks that\nfollowed made everybody sober. The drivers stood up and lashed their\nhorses. The groom had the best team and his sledge was lightest--all the\nothers carried from six to a dozen people.\n\nAnother driver lost control. The screams of the horses were more\nterrible to hear than the cries of the men and women. Nothing seemed to\ncheck the wolves. It was hard to tell what was happening in the rear;\nthe people who were falling behind shrieked as piteously as those who\nwere already lost. The little bride hid her face on the groom’s shoulder\nand sobbed. Pavel sat still and watched his horses. The road was clear\nand white, and the groom’s three blacks went like the wind. It was only\nnecessary to be calm and to guide them carefully.\n\nAt length, as they breasted a long hill, Peter rose cautiously and\nlooked back. ‘There are only three sledges left,’ he whispered.\n\n‘And the wolves?’ Pavel asked.\n\n‘Enough! Enough for all of us.’\n\nPavel reached the brow of the hill, but only two sledges followed him\ndown the other side. In that moment on the hilltop, they saw behind them\na whirling black group on the snow. Presently the groom screamed. He saw\nhis father’s sledge overturned, with his mother and sisters. He sprang\nup as if he meant to jump, but the girl shrieked and held him back. It\nwas even then too late. The black ground-shadows were already crowding\nover the heap in the road, and one horse ran out across the fields, his\nharness hanging to him, wolves at his heels. But the groom’s movement\nhad given Pavel an idea.\n\nThey were within a few miles of their village now. The only sledge left\nout of six was not very far behind them, and Pavel’s middle horse was\nfailing. Beside a frozen pond something happened to the other sledge;\nPeter saw it plainly. Three big wolves got abreast of the horses, and\nthe horses went crazy. They tried to jump over each other, got tangled\nup in the harness, and overturned the sledge.\n\nWhen the shrieking behind them died away, Pavel realized that he was\nalone upon the familiar road. ‘They still come?’ he asked Peter.\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘How many?’\n\n‘Twenty, thirty--enough.’\n\nNow his middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two. Pavel\ngave Peter the reins and stepped carefully into the back of the sledge.\nHe called to the groom that they must lighten--and pointed to the bride.\nThe young man cursed him and held her tighter. Pavel tried to drag her\naway. In the struggle, the groom rose. Pavel knocked him over the side\nof the sledge and threw the girl after him. He said he never remembered\nexactly how he did it, or what happened afterward. Peter, crouching in\nthe front seat, saw nothing. The first thing either of them noticed was\na new sound that broke into the clear air, louder than they had ever\nheard it before--the bell of the monastery of their own village, ringing\nfor early prayers.\n\nPavel and Peter drove into the village alone, and they had been alone\never since. They were run out of their village. Pavel’s own mother\nwould not look at him. They went away to strange towns, but when people\nlearned where they came from, they were always asked if they knew the\ntwo men who had fed the bride to the wolves. Wherever they went, the\nstory followed them. It took them five years to save money enough to\ncome to America. They worked in Chicago, Des Moines, Fort Wayne, but\nthey were always unfortunate. When Pavel’s health grew so bad, they\ndecided to try farming.\n\n\nPavel died a few days after he unburdened his mind to Mr. Shimerda, and\nwas buried in the Norwegian graveyard. Peter sold off everything, and\nleft the country--went to be cook in a railway construction camp where\ngangs of Russians were employed.\n\nAt his sale we bought Peter’s wheelbarrow and some of his harness.\nDuring the auction he went about with his head down, and never\nlifted his eyes. He seemed not to care about anything. The Black Hawk\nmoney-lender who held mortgages on Peter’s livestock was there, and he\nbought in the sale notes at about fifty cents on the dollar. Everyone\nsaid Peter kissed the cow before she was led away by her new owner. I\ndid not see him do it, but this I know: after all his furniture and his\ncookstove and pots and pans had been hauled off by the purchasers,\nwhen his house was stripped and bare, he sat down on the floor with his\nclasp-knife and ate all the melons that he had put away for winter. When\nMr. Shimerda and Krajiek drove up in their wagon to take Peter to the\ntrain, they found him with a dripping beard, surrounded by heaps of\nmelon rinds.\n\nThe loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old Mr.\nShimerda. When he was out hunting, he used to go into the empty log\nhouse and sit there, brooding. This cabin was his hermitage until the\nwinter snows penned him in his cave. For Antonia and me, the story of\nthe wedding party was never at an end. We did not tell Pavel’s secret\nto anyone, but guarded it jealously--as if the wolves of the Ukraine had\ngathered that night long ago, and the wedding party been sacrificed,\nto give us a painful and peculiar pleasure. At night, before I went to\nsleep, I often found myself in a sledge drawn by three horses, dashing\nthrough a country that looked something like Nebraska and something like\nVirginia.\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHE FIRST SNOWFALL came early in December. I remember how the world\nlooked from our sitting-room window as I dressed behind the stove that\nmorning: the low sky was like a sheet of metal; the blond cornfields had\nfaded out into ghostliness at last; the little pond was frozen under its\nstiff willow bushes. Big white flakes were whirling over everything and\ndisappearing in the red grass.\n\nBeyond the pond, on the slope that climbed to the cornfield, there was,\nfaintly marked in the grass, a great circle where the Indians used to\nride. Jake and Otto were sure that when they galloped round that ring\nthe Indians tortured prisoners, bound to a stake in the centre; but\ngrandfather thought they merely ran races or trained horses there.\nWhenever one looked at this slope against the setting sun, the circle\nshowed like a pattern in the grass; and this morning, when the\nfirst light spray of snow lay over it, it came out with wonderful\ndistinctness, like strokes of Chinese white on canvas. The old figure\nstirred me as it had never done before and seemed a good omen for the\nwinter.\n\nAs soon as the snow had packed hard, I began to drive about the country\nin a clumsy sleigh that Otto Fuchs made for me by fastening a wooden\ngoods-box on bobs. Fuchs had been apprenticed to a cabinetmaker in the\nold country and was very handy with tools. He would have done a better\njob if I hadn’t hurried him. My first trip was to the post-office, and\nthe next day I went over to take Yulka and Antonia for a sleigh-ride.\n\nIt was a bright, cold day. I piled straw and buffalo robes into the\nbox, and took two hot bricks wrapped in old blankets. When I got to the\nShimerdas’, I did not go up to the house, but sat in my sleigh at the\nbottom of the draw and called. Antonia and Yulka came running out,\nwearing little rabbit-skin hats their father had made for them. They\nhad heard about my sledge from Ambrosch and knew why I had come. They\ntumbled in beside me and we set off toward the north, along a road that\nhappened to be broken.\n\n\nThe sky was brilliantly blue, and the sunlight on the glittering white\nstretches of prairie was almost blinding. As Antonia said, the whole\nworld was changed by the snow; we kept looking in vain for familiar\nlandmarks. The deep arroyo through which Squaw Creek wound was now only\na cleft between snowdrifts--very blue when one looked down into it. The\ntree-tops that had been gold all the autumn were dwarfed and twisted, as\nif they would never have any life in them again. The few little cedars,\nwhich were so dull and dingy before, now stood out a strong, dusky\ngreen. The wind had the burning taste of fresh snow; my throat and\nnostrils smarted as if someone had opened a hartshorn bottle. The cold\nstung, and at the same time delighted one. My horse’s breath rose like\nsteam, and whenever we stopped he smoked all over. The cornfields got\nback a little of their colour under the dazzling light, and stood the\npalest possible gold in the sun and snow. All about us the snow was\ncrusted in shallow terraces, with tracings like ripple-marks at the\nedges, curly waves that were the actual impression of the stinging lash\nin the wind.\n\nThe girls had on cotton dresses under their shawls; they kept shivering\nbeneath the buffalo robes and hugging each other for warmth. But\nthey were so glad to get away from their ugly cave and their mother’s\nscolding that they begged me to go on and on, as far as Russian Peter’s\nhouse. The great fresh open, after the stupefying warmth indoors, made\nthem behave like wild things. They laughed and shouted, and said they\nnever wanted to go home again. Couldn’t we settle down and live in\nRussian Peter’s house, Yulka asked, and couldn’t I go to town and buy\nthings for us to keep house with?\n\n\nAll the way to Russian Peter’s we were extravagantly happy, but when we\nturned back--it must have been about four o’clock--the east wind grew\nstronger and began to howl; the sun lost its heartening power and the\nsky became grey and sombre. I took off my long woollen comforter and\nwound it around Yulka’s throat. She got so cold that we made her hide\nher head under the buffalo robe. Antonia and I sat erect, but I held the\nreins clumsily, and my eyes were blinded by the wind a good deal of the\ntime. It was growing dark when we got to their house, but I refused to\ngo in with them and get warm. I knew my hands would ache terribly if I\nwent near a fire. Yulka forgot to give me back my comforter, and I had\nto drive home directly against the wind. The next day I came down with\nan attack of quinsy, which kept me in the house for nearly two weeks.\n\nThe basement kitchen seemed heavenly safe and warm in those days--like\na tight little boat in a winter sea. The men were out in the fields all\nday, husking corn, and when they came in at noon, with long caps pulled\ndown over their ears and their feet in red-lined overshoes, I used\nto think they were like Arctic explorers. In the afternoons, when\ngrandmother sat upstairs darning, or making husking-gloves, I read ‘The\nSwiss Family Robinson’ aloud to her, and I felt that the Swiss family\nhad no advantages over us in the way of an adventurous life. I was\nconvinced that man’s strongest antagonist is the cold. I admired the\ncheerful zest with which grandmother went about keeping us warm and\ncomfortable and well-fed. She often reminded me, when she was preparing\nfor the return of the hungry men, that this country was not like\nVirginia; and that here a cook had, as she said, ‘very little to do\nwith.’ On Sundays she gave us as much chicken as we could eat, and on\nother days we had ham or bacon or sausage meat. She baked either pies\nor cake for us every day, unless, for a change, she made my favourite\npudding, striped with currants and boiled in a bag.\n\nNext to getting warm and keeping warm, dinner and supper were the most\ninteresting things we had to think about. Our lives centred around\nwarmth and food and the return of the men at nightfall. I used to\nwonder, when they came in tired from the fields, their feet numb and\ntheir hands cracked and sore, how they could do all the chores so\nconscientiously: feed and water and bed the horses, milk the cows, and\nlook after the pigs. When supper was over, it took them a long while\nto get the cold out of their bones. While grandmother and I washed the\ndishes and grandfather read his paper upstairs, Jake and Otto sat on\nthe long bench behind the stove, ‘easing’ their inside boots, or rubbing\nmutton tallow into their cracked hands.\n\nEvery Saturday night we popped corn or made taffy, and Otto Fuchs used\nto sing, ‘For I Am a Cowboy and Know I’ve Done Wrong,’ or, ‘Bury Me Not\non the Lone Prairee.’ He had a good baritone voice and always led the\nsinging when we went to church services at the sod schoolhouse.\n\nI can still see those two men sitting on the bench; Otto’s close-clipped\nhead and Jake’s shaggy hair slicked flat in front by a wet comb. I can\nsee the sag of their tired shoulders against the whitewashed wall. What\ngood fellows they were, how much they knew, and how many things they had\nkept faith with!\n\nFuchs had been a cowboy, a stage-driver, a bartender, a miner; had\nwandered all over that great Western country and done hard work\neverywhere, though, as grandmother said, he had nothing to show for it.\nJake was duller than Otto. He could scarcely read, wrote even his name\nwith difficulty, and he had a violent temper which sometimes made him\nbehave like a crazy man--tore him all to pieces and actually made him\nill. But he was so soft-hearted that anyone could impose upon him. If\nhe, as he said, ‘forgot himself’ and swore before grandmother, he went\nabout depressed and shamefaced all day. They were both of them jovial\nabout the cold in winter and the heat in summer, always ready to work\novertime and to meet emergencies. It was a matter of pride with them\nnot to spare themselves. Yet they were the sort of men who never get on,\nsomehow, or do anything but work hard for a dollar or two a day.\n\nOn those bitter, starlit nights, as we sat around the old stove that fed\nus and warmed us and kept us cheerful, we could hear the coyotes howling\ndown by the corrals, and their hungry, wintry cry used to remind the\nboys of wonderful animal stories; about grey wolves and bears in the\nRockies, wildcats and panthers in the Virginia mountains. Sometimes\nFuchs could be persuaded to talk about the outlaws and desperate\ncharacters he had known. I remember one funny story about himself that\nmade grandmother, who was working her bread on the bread-board, laugh\nuntil she wiped her eyes with her bare arm, her hands being floury. It\nwas like this:\n\nWhen Otto left Austria to come to America, he was asked by one of his\nrelatives to look after a woman who was crossing on the same boat, to\njoin her husband in Chicago. The woman started off with two children,\nbut it was clear that her family might grow larger on the journey. Fuchs\nsaid he ‘got on fine with the kids,’ and liked the mother, though she\nplayed a sorry trick on him. In mid-ocean she proceeded to have not\none baby, but three! This event made Fuchs the object of undeserved\nnotoriety, since he was travelling with her. The steerage stewardess\nwas indignant with him, the doctor regarded him with suspicion. The\nfirst-cabin passengers, who made up a purse for the woman, took an\nembarrassing interest in Otto, and often enquired of him about his\ncharge. When the triplets were taken ashore at New York, he had, as he\nsaid, ‘to carry some of them.’ The trip to Chicago was even worse than\nthe ocean voyage. On the train it was very difficult to get milk for the\nbabies and to keep their bottles clean. The mother did her best, but\nno woman, out of her natural resources, could feed three babies. The\nhusband, in Chicago, was working in a furniture factory for modest\nwages, and when he met his family at the station he was rather crushed\nby the size of it. He, too, seemed to consider Fuchs in some fashion to\nblame. ‘I was sure glad,’ Otto concluded, ‘that he didn’t take his hard\nfeeling out on that poor woman; but he had a sullen eye for me, all\nright! Now, did you ever hear of a young feller’s having such hard luck,\nMrs. Burden?’\n\nGrandmother told him she was sure the Lord had remembered these things\nto his credit, and had helped him out of many a scrape when he didn’t\nrealize that he was being protected by Providence.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nFOR SEVERAL WEEKS after my sleigh-ride, we heard nothing from the\nShimerdas. My sore throat kept me indoors, and grandmother had a cold\nwhich made the housework heavy for her. When Sunday came she was glad\nto have a day of rest. One night at supper Fuchs told us he had seen Mr.\nShimerda out hunting.\n\n‘He’s made himself a rabbit-skin cap, Jim, and a rabbit-skin collar that\nhe buttons on outside his coat. They ain’t got but one overcoat among\n‘em over there, and they take turns wearing it. They seem awful scared\nof cold, and stick in that hole in the bank like badgers.’\n\n‘All but the crazy boy,’ Jake put in. ‘He never wears the coat. Krajiek\nsays he’s turrible strong and can stand anything. I guess rabbits must\nbe getting scarce in this locality. Ambrosch come along by the cornfield\nyesterday where I was at work and showed me three prairie dogs he’d\nshot. He asked me if they was good to eat. I spit and made a face and\ntook on, to scare him, but he just looked like he was smarter’n me and\nput ‘em back in his sack and walked off.’\n\nGrandmother looked up in alarm and spoke to grandfather. ‘Josiah, you\ndon’t suppose Krajiek would let them poor creatures eat prairie dogs, do\nyou?’\n\n‘You had better go over and see our neighbours tomorrow, Emmaline,’ he\nreplied gravely.\n\nFuchs put in a cheerful word and said prairie dogs were clean beasts\nand ought to be good for food, but their family connections were against\nthem. I asked what he meant, and he grinned and said they belonged to\nthe rat family.\n\nWhen I went downstairs in the morning, I found grandmother and Jake\npacking a hamper basket in the kitchen.\n\n‘Now, Jake,’ grandmother was saying, ‘if you can find that old rooster\nthat got his comb froze, just give his neck a twist, and we’ll take him\nalong. There’s no good reason why Mrs. Shimerda couldn’t have got hens\nfrom her neighbours last fall and had a hen-house going by now. I reckon\nshe was confused and didn’t know where to begin. I’ve come strange to a\nnew country myself, but I never forgot hens are a good thing to have, no\nmatter what you don’t have.\n\n‘Just as you say, ma’m,’ said Jake, ‘but I hate to think of Krajiek\ngetting a leg of that old rooster.’ He tramped out through the long\ncellar and dropped the heavy door behind him.\n\nAfter breakfast grandmother and Jake and I bundled ourselves up and\nclimbed into the cold front wagon-seat. As we approached the Shimerdas’,\nwe heard the frosty whine of the pump and saw Antonia, her head tied\nup and her cotton dress blown about her, throwing all her weight on the\npump-handle as it went up and down. She heard our wagon, looked back\nover her shoulder, and, catching up her pail of water, started at a run\nfor the hole in the bank.\n\nJake helped grandmother to the ground, saying he would bring the\nprovisions after he had blanketed his horses. We went slowly up the icy\npath toward the door sunk in the drawside. Blue puffs of smoke came from\nthe stovepipe that stuck out through the grass and snow, but the wind\nwhisked them roughly away.\n\nMrs. Shimerda opened the door before we knocked and seized grandmother’s\nhand. She did not say ‘How do!’ as usual, but at once began to cry,\ntalking very fast in her own language, pointing to her feet which were\ntied up in rags, and looking about accusingly at everyone.\n\nThe old man was sitting on a stump behind the stove, crouching over as\nif he were trying to hide from us. Yulka was on the floor at his feet,\nher kitten in her lap. She peeped out at me and smiled, but, glancing up\nat her mother, hid again. Antonia was washing pans and dishes in a\ndark corner. The crazy boy lay under the only window, stretched on\na gunny-sack stuffed with straw. As soon as we entered, he threw a\ngrain-sack over the crack at the bottom of the door. The air in the cave\nwas stifling, and it was very dark, too. A lighted lantern, hung over\nthe stove, threw out a feeble yellow glimmer.\n\nMrs. Shimerda snatched off the covers of two barrels behind the door,\nand made us look into them. In one there were some potatoes that had\nbeen frozen and were rotting, in the other was a little pile of flour.\nGrandmother murmured something in embarrassment, but the Bohemian woman\nlaughed scornfully, a kind of whinny-laugh, and, catching up an empty\ncoffee-pot from the shelf, shook it at us with a look positively\nvindictive.\n\nGrandmother went on talking in her polite Virginia way, not admitting\ntheir stark need or her own remissness, until Jake arrived with the\nhamper, as if in direct answer to Mrs. Shimerda’s reproaches. Then the\npoor woman broke down. She dropped on the floor beside her crazy son,\nhid her face on her knees, and sat crying bitterly. Grandmother paid no\nheed to her, but called Antonia to come and help empty the basket. Tony\nleft her corner reluctantly. I had never seen her crushed like this\nbefore.\n\n‘You not mind my poor mamenka, Mrs. Burden. She is so sad,’ she\nwhispered, as she wiped her wet hands on her skirt and took the things\ngrandmother handed her.\n\nThe crazy boy, seeing the food, began to make soft, gurgling noises\nand stroked his stomach. Jake came in again, this time with a sack of\npotatoes. Grandmother looked about in perplexity.\n\n‘Haven’t you got any sort of cave or cellar outside, Antonia? This is no\nplace to keep vegetables. How did your potatoes get frozen?’\n\n‘We get from Mr. Bushy, at the post-office what he throw out. We got no\npotatoes, Mrs. Burden,’ Tony admitted mournfully.\n\nWhen Jake went out, Marek crawled along the floor and stuffed up the\ndoor-crack again. Then, quietly as a shadow, Mr. Shimerda came out from\nbehind the stove. He stood brushing his hand over his smooth grey hair,\nas if he were trying to clear away a fog about his head. He was clean\nand neat as usual, with his green neckcloth and his coral pin. He took\ngrandmother’s arm and led her behind the stove, to the back of the room.\nIn the rear wall was another little cave; a round hole, not much bigger\nthan an oil barrel, scooped out in the black earth. When I got up on one\nof the stools and peered into it, I saw some quilts and a pile of straw.\nThe old man held the lantern. ‘Yulka,’ he said in a low, despairing\nvoice, ‘Yulka; my Antonia!’\n\nGrandmother drew back. ‘You mean they sleep in there--your girls?’ He\nbowed his head.\n\nTony slipped under his arm. ‘It is very cold on the floor, and this\nis warm like the badger hole. I like for sleep there,’ she insisted\neagerly. ‘My mamenka have nice bed, with pillows from our own geese in\nBohemie. See, Jim?’ She pointed to the narrow bunk which Krajiek had\nbuilt against the wall for himself before the Shimerdas came.\n\nGrandmother sighed. ‘Sure enough, where WOULD you sleep, dear! I\ndon’t doubt you’re warm there. You’ll have a better house after while,\nAntonia, and then you will forget these hard times.’\n\nMr. Shimerda made grandmother sit down on the only chair and pointed\nhis wife to a stool beside her. Standing before them with his hand\non Antonia’s shoulder, he talked in a low tone, and his daughter\ntranslated. He wanted us to know that they were not beggars in the old\ncountry; he made good wages, and his family were respected there. He\nleft Bohemia with more than a thousand dollars in savings, after their\npassage money was paid. He had in some way lost on exchange in New York,\nand the railway fare to Nebraska was more than they had expected. By the\ntime they paid Krajiek for the land, and bought his horses and oxen\nand some old farm machinery, they had very little money left. He wished\ngrandmother to know, however, that he still had some money. If they\ncould get through until spring came, they would buy a cow and chickens\nand plant a garden, and would then do very well. Ambrosch and Antonia\nwere both old enough to work in the fields, and they were willing to\nwork. But the snow and the bitter weather had disheartened them all.\n\nAntonia explained that her father meant to build a new house for them in\nthe spring; he and Ambrosch had already split the logs for it, but the\nlogs were all buried in the snow, along the creek where they had been\nfelled.\n\nWhile grandmother encouraged and gave them advice, I sat down on the\nfloor with Yulka and let her show me her kitten. Marek slid cautiously\ntoward us and began to exhibit his webbed fingers. I knew he wanted\nto make his queer noises for me--to bark like a dog or whinny like a\nhorse--but he did not dare in the presence of his elders. Marek was\nalways trying to be agreeable, poor fellow, as if he had it on his mind\nthat he must make up for his deficiencies.\n\nMrs. Shimerda grew more calm and reasonable before our visit was over,\nand, while Antonia translated, put in a word now and then on her own\naccount. The woman had a quick ear, and caught up phrases whenever she\nheard English spoken. As we rose to go, she opened her wooden chest and\nbrought out a bag made of bed-ticking, about as long as a flour sack and\nhalf as wide, stuffed full of something. At sight of it, the crazy boy\nbegan to smack his lips. When Mrs. Shimerda opened the bag and stirred\nthe contents with her hand, it gave out a salty, earthy smell, very\npungent, even among the other odours of that cave. She measured a teacup\nfull, tied it up in a bit of sacking, and presented it ceremoniously to\ngrandmother.\n\n‘For cook,’ she announced. ‘Little now; be very much when cook,’\nspreading out her hands as if to indicate that the pint would swell to\na gallon. ‘Very good. You no have in this country. All things for eat\nbetter in my country.’\n\n‘Maybe so, Mrs. Shimerda,’ grandmother said dryly. ‘I can’t say but I\nprefer our bread to yours, myself.’\n\nAntonia undertook to explain. ‘This very good, Mrs. Burden’--she clasped\nher hands as if she could not express how good--‘it make very much when\nyou cook, like what my mama say. Cook with rabbit, cook with chicken, in\nthe gravy--oh, so good!’\n\nAll the way home grandmother and Jake talked about how easily good\nChristian people could forget they were their brothers’ keepers.\n\n‘I will say, Jake, some of our brothers and sisters are hard to\nkeep. Where’s a body to begin, with these people? They’re wanting in\neverything, and most of all in horse-sense. Nobody can give ‘em that,\nI guess. Jimmy, here, is about as able to take over a homestead as they\nare. Do you reckon that boy Ambrosch has any real push in him?’\n\n‘He’s a worker, all right, ma’m, and he’s got some ketch-on about him;\nbut he’s a mean one. Folks can be mean enough to get on in this world;\nand then, ag’in, they can be too mean.’\n\nThat night, while grandmother was getting supper, we opened the package\nMrs. Shimerda had given her. It was full of little brown chips that\nlooked like the shavings of some root. They were as light as feathers,\nand the most noticeable thing about them was their penetrating, earthy\nodour. We could not determine whether they were animal or vegetable.\n\n‘They might be dried meat from some queer beast, Jim. They ain’t dried\nfish, and they never grew on stalk or vine. I’m afraid of ‘em. Anyhow, I\nshouldn’t want to eat anything that had been shut up for months with old\nclothes and goose pillows.’\n\nShe threw the package into the stove, but I bit off a corner of one of\nthe chips I held in my hand, and chewed it tentatively. I never forgot\nthe strange taste; though it was many years before I knew that those\nlittle brown shavings, which the Shimerdas had brought so far and\ntreasured so jealously, were dried mushrooms. They had been gathered,\nprobably, in some deep Bohemian forest....\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nDURING THE WEEK before Christmas, Jake was the most important person\nof our household, for he was to go to town and do all our Christmas\nshopping. But on the twenty-first of December, the snow began to fall.\nThe flakes came down so thickly that from the sitting-room windows\nI could not see beyond the windmill--its frame looked dim and grey,\nunsubstantial like a shadow. The snow did not stop falling all day, or\nduring the night that followed. The cold was not severe, but the storm\nwas quiet and resistless. The men could not go farther than the barns\nand corral. They sat about the house most of the day as if it were\nSunday; greasing their boots, mending their suspenders, plaiting\nwhiplashes.\n\nOn the morning of the twenty-second, grandfather announced at breakfast\nthat it would be impossible to go to Black Hawk for Christmas purchases.\nJake was sure he could get through on horseback, and bring home our\nthings in saddle-bags; but grandfather told him the roads would be\nobliterated, and a newcomer in the country would be lost ten times\nover. Anyway, he would never allow one of his horses to be put to such a\nstrain.\n\nWe decided to have a country Christmas, without any help from town. I\nhad wanted to get some picture books for Yulka and Antonia; even Yulka\nwas able to read a little now. Grandmother took me into the ice-cold\nstoreroom, where she had some bolts of gingham and sheeting. She cut\nsquares of cotton cloth and we sewed them together into a book. We\nbound it between pasteboards, which I covered with brilliant calico,\nrepresenting scenes from a circus. For two days I sat at the dining-room\ntable, pasting this book full of pictures for Yulka. We had files\nof those good old family magazines which used to publish coloured\nlithographs of popular paintings, and I was allowed to use some of\nthese. I took ‘Napoleon Announcing the Divorce to Josephine’ for my\nfrontispiece. On the white pages I grouped Sunday-School cards and\nadvertising cards which I had brought from my ‘old country.’ Fuchs got\nout the old candle-moulds and made tallow candles. Grandmother hunted up\nher fancy cake-cutters and baked gingerbread men and roosters, which we\ndecorated with burnt sugar and red cinnamon drops.\n\nOn the day before Christmas, Jake packed the things we were sending\nto the Shimerdas in his saddle-bags and set off on grandfather’s grey\ngelding. When he mounted his horse at the door, I saw that he had a\nhatchet slung to his belt, and he gave grandmother a meaning look which\ntold me he was planning a surprise for me. That afternoon I watched\nlong and eagerly from the sitting-room window. At last I saw a dark spot\nmoving on the west hill, beside the half-buried cornfield, where the\nsky was taking on a coppery flush from the sun that did not quite break\nthrough. I put on my cap and ran out to meet Jake. When I got to the\npond, I could see that he was bringing in a little cedar tree across\nhis pommel. He used to help my father cut Christmas trees for me in\nVirginia, and he had not forgotten how much I liked them.\n\nBy the time we had placed the cold, fresh-smelling little tree in a\ncorner of the sitting-room, it was already Christmas Eve. After supper\nwe all gathered there, and even grandfather, reading his paper by the\ntable, looked up with friendly interest now and then. The cedar was\nabout five feet high and very shapely. We hung it with the gingerbread\nanimals, strings of popcorn, and bits of candle which Fuchs had fitted\ninto pasteboard sockets. Its real splendours, however, came from the\nmost unlikely place in the world--from Otto’s cowboy trunk. I had never\nseen anything in that trunk but old boots and spurs and pistols, and\na fascinating mixture of yellow leather thongs, cartridges, and\nshoemaker’s wax. From under the lining he now produced a collection of\nbrilliantly coloured paper figures, several inches high and stiff enough\nto stand alone. They had been sent to him year after year, by his old\nmother in Austria. There was a bleeding heart, in tufts of paper lace;\nthere were the three kings, gorgeously apparelled, and the ox and the\nass and the shepherds; there was the Baby in the manger, and a group\nof angels, singing; there were camels and leopards, held by the black\nslaves of the three kings. Our tree became the talking tree of the\nfairy tale; legends and stories nestled like birds in its branches.\nGrandmother said it reminded her of the Tree of Knowledge. We put sheets\nof cotton wool under it for a snow-field, and Jake’s pocket-mirror for a\nfrozen lake.\n\nI can see them now, exactly as they looked, working about the table in\nthe lamplight: Jake with his heavy features, so rudely moulded that his\nface seemed, somehow, unfinished; Otto with his half-ear and the savage\nscar that made his upper lip curl so ferociously under his twisted\nmoustache. As I remember them, what unprotected faces they were; their\nvery roughness and violence made them defenceless. These boys had no\npractised manner behind which they could retreat and hold people at a\ndistance. They had only their hard fists to batter at the world with.\nOtto was already one of those drifting, case-hardened labourers who\nnever marry or have children of their own. Yet he was so fond of\nchildren!\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nON CHRISTMAS MORNING, when I got down to the kitchen, the men were just\ncoming in from their morning chores--the horses and pigs always had\ntheir breakfast before we did. Jake and Otto shouted ‘Merry Christmas!’\nto me, and winked at each other when they saw the waffle-irons on the\nstove. Grandfather came down, wearing a white shirt and his Sunday coat.\nMorning prayers were longer than usual. He read the chapters from Saint\nMatthew about the birth of Christ, and as we listened, it all seemed\nlike something that had happened lately, and near at hand. In his prayer\nhe thanked the Lord for the first Christmas, and for all that it had\nmeant to the world ever since. He gave thanks for our food and comfort,\nand prayed for the poor and destitute in great cities, where the\nstruggle for life was harder than it was here with us. Grandfather’s\nprayers were often very interesting. He had the gift of simple and\nmoving expression. Because he talked so little, his words had a peculiar\nforce; they were not worn dull from constant use. His prayers reflected\nwhat he was thinking about at the time, and it was chiefly through them\nthat we got to know his feelings and his views about things.\n\nAfter we sat down to our waffles and sausage, Jake told us how pleased\nthe Shimerdas had been with their presents; even Ambrosch was friendly\nand went to the creek with him to cut the Christmas tree. It was a\nsoft grey day outside, with heavy clouds working across the sky, and\noccasional squalls of snow. There were always odd jobs to be done about\nthe barn on holidays, and the men were busy until afternoon. Then\nJake and I played dominoes, while Otto wrote a long letter home to his\nmother. He always wrote to her on Christmas Day, he said, no matter\nwhere he was, and no matter how long it had been since his last letter.\nAll afternoon he sat in the dining-room. He would write for a while,\nthen sit idle, his clenched fist lying on the table, his eyes following\nthe pattern of the oilcloth. He spoke and wrote his own language so\nseldom that it came to him awkwardly. His effort to remember entirely\nabsorbed him.\n\nAt about four o’clock a visitor appeared: Mr. Shimerda, wearing his\nrabbit-skin cap and collar, and new mittens his wife had knitted. He had\ncome to thank us for the presents, and for all grandmother’s kindness to\nhis family. Jake and Otto joined us from the basement and we sat about\nthe stove, enjoying the deepening grey of the winter afternoon and\nthe atmosphere of comfort and security in my grandfather’s house. This\nfeeling seemed completely to take possession of Mr. Shimerda. I suppose,\nin the crowded clutter of their cave, the old man had come to believe\nthat peace and order had vanished from the earth, or existed only in the\nold world he had left so far behind. He sat still and passive, his head\nresting against the back of the wooden rocking-chair, his hands relaxed\nupon the arms. His face had a look of weariness and pleasure, like that\nof sick people when they feel relief from pain. Grandmother insisted on\nhis drinking a glass of Virginia apple-brandy after his long walk in the\ncold, and when a faint flush came up in his cheeks, his features might\nhave been cut out of a shell, they were so transparent. He said almost\nnothing, and smiled rarely; but as he rested there we all had a sense of\nhis utter content.\n\nAs it grew dark, I asked whether I might light the Christmas tree before\nthe lamp was brought. When the candle-ends sent up their conical yellow\nflames, all the coloured figures from Austria stood out clear and full\nof meaning against the green boughs. Mr. Shimerda rose, crossed himself,\nand quietly knelt down before the tree, his head sunk forward. His\nlong body formed a letter ‘S.’ I saw grandmother look apprehensively at\ngrandfather. He was rather narrow in religious matters, and sometimes\nspoke out and hurt people’s feelings. There had been nothing strange\nabout the tree before, but now, with some one kneeling before\nit--images, candles... Grandfather merely put his finger-tips to his\nbrow and bowed his venerable head, thus Protestantizing the atmosphere.\n\nWe persuaded our guest to stay for supper with us. He needed little\nurging. As we sat down to the table, it occurred to me that he liked\nto look at us, and that our faces were open books to him. When his\ndeep-seeing eyes rested on me, I felt as if he were looking far ahead\ninto the future for me, down the road I would have to travel.\n\nAt nine o’clock Mr. Shimerda lighted one of our lanterns and put on his\novercoat and fur collar. He stood in the little entry hall, the lantern\nand his fur cap under his arm, shaking hands with us. When he took\ngrandmother’s hand, he bent over it as he always did, and said slowly,\n‘Good woman!’ He made the sign of the cross over me, put on his cap and\nwent off in the dark. As we turned back to the sitting-room, grandfather\nlooked at me searchingly. ‘The prayers of all good people are good,’ he\nsaid quietly.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nTHE WEEK FOLLOWING Christmas brought in a thaw, and by New Year’s Day\nall the world about us was a broth of grey slush, and the guttered slope\nbetween the windmill and the barn was running black water. The soft\nblack earth stood out in patches along the roadsides. I resumed all my\nchores, carried in the cobs and wood and water, and spent the afternoons\nat the barn, watching Jake shell corn with a hand-sheller.\n\nOne morning, during this interval of fine weather, Antonia and her\nmother rode over on one of their shaggy old horses to pay us a visit.\nIt was the first time Mrs. Shimerda had been to our house, and she ran\nabout examining our carpets and curtains and furniture, all the while\ncommenting upon them to her daughter in an envious, complaining tone.\nIn the kitchen she caught up an iron pot that stood on the back of\nthe stove and said: ‘You got many, Shimerdas no got.’ I thought it\nweak-minded of grandmother to give the pot to her.\n\nAfter dinner, when she was helping to wash the dishes, she said, tossing\nher head: ‘You got many things for cook. If I got all things like you, I\nmake much better.’\n\nShe was a conceited, boastful old thing, and even misfortune could not\nhumble her. I was so annoyed that I felt coldly even toward Antonia and\nlistened unsympathetically when she told me her father was not well.\n\n‘My papa sad for the old country. He not look good. He never make music\nany more. At home he play violin all the time; for weddings and for\ndance. Here never. When I beg him for play, he shake his head no. Some\ndays he take his violin out of his box and make with his fingers on\nthe strings, like this, but never he make the music. He don’t like this\nkawntree.’\n\n‘People who don’t like this country ought to stay at home,’ I said\nseverely. ‘We don’t make them come here.’\n\n‘He not want to come, never!’ she burst out. ‘My mamenka make him come.\nAll the time she say: “America big country; much money, much land for\nmy boys, much husband for my girls.” My papa, he cry for leave his old\nfriends what make music with him. He love very much the man what play\nthe long horn like this’--she indicated a slide trombone. “They go\nto school together and are friends from boys. But my mama, she want\nAmbrosch for be rich, with many cattle.”’\n\n‘Your mama,’ I said angrily, ‘wants other people’s things.’\n\n“Your grandfather is rich,” she retorted fiercely. ‘Why he not help my\npapa? Ambrosch be rich, too, after while, and he pay back. He is very\nsmart boy. For Ambrosch my mama come here.’\n\nAmbrosch was considered the important person in the family. Mrs.\nShimerda and Antonia always deferred to him, though he was often surly\nwith them and contemptuous toward his father. Ambrosch and his mother\nhad everything their own way. Though Antonia loved her father more than\nshe did anyone else, she stood in awe of her elder brother.\n\nAfter I watched Antonia and her mother go over the hill on their\nmiserable horse, carrying our iron pot with them, I turned to\ngrandmother, who had taken up her darning, and said I hoped that\nsnooping old woman wouldn’t come to see us any more.\n\nGrandmother chuckled and drove her bright needle across a hole in Otto’s\nsock. ‘She’s not old, Jim, though I expect she seems old to you. No, I\nwouldn’t mourn if she never came again. But, you see, a body never knows\nwhat traits poverty might bring out in ‘em. It makes a woman grasping to\nsee her children want for things. Now read me a chapter in “The Prince\nof the House of David.” Let’s forget the Bohemians.’\n\nWe had three weeks of this mild, open weather. The cattle in the corral\nate corn almost as fast as the men could shell it for them, and we hoped\nthey would be ready for an early market. One morning the two big bulls,\nGladstone and Brigham Young, thought spring had come, and they began to\ntease and butt at each other across the barbed wire that separated them.\nSoon they got angry. They bellowed and pawed up the soft earth with\ntheir hoofs, rolling their eyes and tossing their heads. Each withdrew\nto a far corner of his own corral, and then they made for each other at\na gallop. Thud, thud, we could hear the impact of their great heads, and\ntheir bellowing shook the pans on the kitchen shelves. Had they not been\ndehorned, they would have torn each other to pieces. Pretty soon the fat\nsteers took it up and began butting and horning each other. Clearly, the\naffair had to be stopped. We all stood by and watched admiringly while\nFuchs rode into the corral with a pitchfork and prodded the bulls again\nand again, finally driving them apart.\n\nThe big storm of the winter began on my eleventh birthday, the twentieth\nof January. When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto\ncame in white as snow-men, beating their hands and stamping their feet.\nThey began to laugh boisterously when they saw me, calling:\n\n‘You’ve got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake. They was\na full-grown blizzard ordered for you.’\n\nAll day the storm went on. The snow did not fall this time, it simply\nspilled out of heaven, like thousands of featherbeds being emptied. That\nafternoon the kitchen was a carpenter-shop; the men brought in their\ntools and made two great wooden shovels with long handles. Neither\ngrandmother nor I could go out in the storm, so Jake fed the chickens\nand brought in a pitiful contribution of eggs.\n\nNext day our men had to shovel until noon to reach the barn--and the\nsnow was still falling! There had not been such a storm in the ten years\nmy grandfather had lived in Nebraska. He said at dinner that we would\nnot try to reach the cattle--they were fat enough to go without their\ncorn for a day or two; but tomorrow we must feed them and thaw out their\nwater-tap so that they could drink. We could not so much as see the\ncorrals, but we knew the steers were over there, huddled together under\nthe north bank. Our ferocious bulls, subdued enough by this time, were\nprobably warming each other’s backs. ‘This’ll take the bile out of ‘em!’\nFuchs remarked gleefully.\n\nAt noon that day the hens had not been heard from. After dinner Jake and\nOtto, their damp clothes now dried on them, stretched their stiff arms\nand plunged again into the drifts. They made a tunnel through the snow\nto the hen-house, with walls so solid that grandmother and I could walk\nback and forth in it. We found the chickens asleep; perhaps they thought\nnight had come to stay. One old rooster was stirring about, pecking at\nthe solid lump of ice in their water-tin. When we flashed the lantern\nin their eyes, the hens set up a great cackling and flew about clumsily,\nscattering down-feathers. The mottled, pin-headed guinea-hens, always\nresentful of captivity, ran screeching out into the tunnel and tried to\npoke their ugly, painted faces through the snow walls. By five o’clock\nthe chores were done just when it was time to begin them all over again!\nThat was a strange, unnatural sort of day.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nON THE MORNING of the twenty-second I wakened with a start. Before I\nopened my eyes, I seemed to know that something had happened. I heard\nexcited voices in the kitchen--grandmother’s was so shrill that I knew\nshe must be almost beside herself. I looked forward to any new crisis\nwith delight. What could it be, I wondered, as I hurried into my\nclothes. Perhaps the barn had burned; perhaps the cattle had frozen to\ndeath; perhaps a neighbour was lost in the storm.\n\nDown in the kitchen grandfather was standing before the stove with\nhis hands behind him. Jake and Otto had taken off their boots and were\nrubbing their woollen socks. Their clothes and boots were steaming, and\nthey both looked exhausted. On the bench behind the stove lay a man,\ncovered up with a blanket. Grandmother motioned me to the dining-room. I\nobeyed reluctantly. I watched her as she came and went, carrying dishes.\nHer lips were tightly compressed and she kept whispering to herself:\n‘Oh, dear Saviour!’ ‘Lord, Thou knowest!’\n\nPresently grandfather came in and spoke to me: ‘Jimmy, we will not\nhave prayers this morning, because we have a great deal to do. Old Mr.\nShimerda is dead, and his family are in great distress. Ambrosch came\nover here in the middle of the night, and Jake and Otto went back with\nhim. The boys have had a hard night, and you must not bother them with\nquestions. That is Ambrosch, asleep on the bench. Come in to breakfast,\nboys.’\n\nAfter Jake and Otto had swallowed their first cup of coffee, they began\nto talk excitedly, disregarding grandmother’s warning glances. I held my\ntongue, but I listened with all my ears.\n\n‘No, sir,’ Fuchs said in answer to a question from grandfather, ‘nobody\nheard the gun go off. Ambrosch was out with the ox-team, trying to\nbreak a road, and the women-folks was shut up tight in their cave. When\nAmbrosch come in, it was dark and he didn’t see nothing, but the\noxen acted kind of queer. One of ‘em ripped around and got away from\nhim--bolted clean out of the stable. His hands is blistered where the\nrope run through. He got a lantern and went back and found the old man,\njust as we seen him.’\n\n‘Poor soul, poor soul!’ grandmother groaned. ‘I’d like to think he never\ndone it. He was always considerate and un-wishful to give trouble. How\ncould he forget himself and bring this on us!’\n\n‘I don’t think he was out of his head for a minute, Mrs. Burden,’ Fuchs\ndeclared. ‘He done everything natural. You know he was always sort of\nfixy, and fixy he was to the last. He shaved after dinner, and washed\nhisself all over after the girls had done the dishes. Antonia heated the\nwater for him. Then he put on a clean shirt and clean socks, and after\nhe was dressed he kissed her and the little one and took his gun and\nsaid he was going out to hunt rabbits. He must have gone right down to\nthe barn and done it then. He layed down on that bunk-bed, close to\nthe ox stalls, where he always slept. When we found him, everything was\ndecent except’--Fuchs wrinkled his brow and hesitated--‘except what he\ncouldn’t nowise foresee. His coat was hung on a peg, and his boots was\nunder the bed. He’d took off that silk neckcloth he always wore, and\nfolded it smooth and stuck his pin through it. He turned back his shirt\nat the neck and rolled up his sleeves.’\n\n‘I don’t see how he could do it!’ grandmother kept saying.\n\nOtto misunderstood her. ‘Why, ma’am, it was simple enough; he pulled the\ntrigger with his big toe. He layed over on his side and put the end\nof the barrel in his mouth, then he drew up one foot and felt for the\ntrigger. He found it all right!’\n\n‘Maybe he did,’ said Jake grimly. ‘There’s something mighty queer about\nit.’\n\n‘Now what do you mean, Jake?’ grandmother asked sharply.\n\n‘Well, ma’m, I found Krajiek’s axe under the manger, and I picks it up\nand carries it over to the corpse, and I take my oath it just fit the\ngash in the front of the old man’s face. That there Krajiek had been\nsneakin’ round, pale and quiet, and when he seen me examinin’ the axe,\nhe begun whimperin’, “My God, man, don’t do that!” “I reckon I’m a-goin’\nto look into this,” says I. Then he begun to squeal like a rat and run\nabout wringin’ his hands. “They’ll hang me!” says he. “My God, they’ll\nhang me sure!”’\n\nFuchs spoke up impatiently. ‘Krajiek’s gone silly, Jake, and so have\nyou. The old man wouldn’t have made all them preparations for Krajiek to\nmurder him, would he? It don’t hang together. The gun was right beside\nhim when Ambrosch found him.’\n\n‘Krajiek could ‘a’ put it there, couldn’t he?’ Jake demanded.\n\nGrandmother broke in excitedly: ‘See here, Jake Marpole, don’t you go\ntrying to add murder to suicide. We’re deep enough in trouble. Otto\nreads you too many of them detective stories.’\n\n‘It will be easy to decide all that, Emmaline,’ said grandfather\nquietly. ‘If he shot himself in the way they think, the gash will be\ntorn from the inside outward.’\n\n‘Just so it is, Mr. Burden,’ Otto affirmed. ‘I seen bunches of hair and\nstuff sticking to the poles and straw along the roof. They was blown up\nthere by gunshot, no question.’\n\nGrandmother told grandfather she meant to go over to the Shimerdas’ with\nhim.\n\n‘There is nothing you can do,’ he said doubtfully. ‘The body can’t be\ntouched until we get the coroner here from Black Hawk, and that will be\na matter of several days, this weather.’\n\n‘Well, I can take them some victuals, anyway, and say a word of comfort\nto them poor little girls. The oldest one was his darling, and was like\na right hand to him. He might have thought of her. He’s left her alone\nin a hard world.’ She glanced distrustfully at Ambrosch, who was now\neating his breakfast at the kitchen table.\n\nFuchs, although he had been up in the cold nearly all night, was going\nto make the long ride to Black Hawk to fetch the priest and the coroner.\nOn the grey gelding, our best horse, he would try to pick his way across\nthe country with no roads to guide him.\n\n‘Don’t you worry about me, Mrs. Burden,’ he said cheerfully, as he put\non a second pair of socks. ‘I’ve got a good nose for directions, and I\nnever did need much sleep. It’s the grey I’m worried about. I’ll save\nhim what I can, but it’ll strain him, as sure as I’m telling you!’\n\n‘This is no time to be over-considerate of animals, Otto; do the best\nyou can for yourself. Stop at the Widow Steavens’s for dinner. She’s a\ngood woman, and she’ll do well by you.’\n\nAfter Fuchs rode away, I was left with Ambrosch. I saw a side of him I\nhad not seen before. He was deeply, even slavishly, devout. He did not\nsay a word all morning, but sat with his rosary in his hands, praying,\nnow silently, now aloud. He never looked away from his beads, nor lifted\nhis hands except to cross himself. Several times the poor boy fell\nasleep where he sat, wakened with a start, and began to pray again.\n\nNo wagon could be got to the Shimerdas’ until a road was broken, and\nthat would be a day’s job. Grandfather came from the barn on one of our\nbig black horses, and Jake lifted grandmother up behind him. She wore\nher black hood and was bundled up in shawls. Grandfather tucked his\nbushy white beard inside his overcoat. They looked very Biblical as they\nset off, I thought. Jake and Ambrosch followed them, riding the other\nblack and my pony, carrying bundles of clothes that we had got together\nfor Mrs. Shimerda. I watched them go past the pond and over the hill by\nthe drifted cornfield. Then, for the first time, I realized that I was\nalone in the house.\n\nI felt a considerable extension of power and authority, and was anxious\nto acquit myself creditably. I carried in cobs and wood from the long\ncellar, and filled both the stoves. I remembered that in the hurry and\nexcitement of the morning nobody had thought of the chickens, and the\neggs had not been gathered. Going out through the tunnel, I gave the\nhens their corn, emptied the ice from their drinking-pan, and filled\nit with water. After the cat had had his milk, I could think of nothing\nelse to do, and I sat down to get warm. The quiet was delightful, and\nthe ticking clock was the most pleasant of companions. I got ‘Robinson\nCrusoe’ and tried to read, but his life on the island seemed dull\ncompared with ours. Presently, as I looked with satisfaction about our\ncomfortable sitting-room, it flashed upon me that if Mr. Shimerda’s\nsoul were lingering about in this world at all, it would be here, in\nour house, which had been more to his liking than any other in the\nneighbourhood. I remembered his contented face when he was with us on\nChristmas Day. If he could have lived with us, this terrible thing would\nnever have happened.\n\nI knew it was homesickness that had killed Mr. Shimerda, and I wondered\nwhether his released spirit would not eventually find its way back to\nhis own country. I thought of how far it was to Chicago, and then to\nVirginia, to Baltimore--and then the great wintry ocean. No, he would\nnot at once set out upon that long journey. Surely, his exhausted\nspirit, so tired of cold and crowding and the struggle with the\never-falling snow, was resting now in this quiet house.\n\nI was not frightened, but I made no noise. I did not wish to disturb\nhim. I went softly down to the kitchen which, tucked away so snugly\nunderground, always seemed to me the heart and centre of the house.\nThere, on the bench behind the stove, I thought and thought about Mr.\nShimerda. Outside I could hear the wind singing over hundreds of miles\nof snow. It was as if I had let the old man in out of the tormenting\nwinter, and were sitting there with him. I went over all that Antonia\nhad ever told me about his life before he came to this country; how\nhe used to play the fiddle at weddings and dances. I thought about the\nfriends he had mourned to leave, the trombone-player, the great forest\nfull of game--belonging, as Antonia said, to the ‘nobles’--from which\nshe and her mother used to steal wood on moonlight nights. There was a\nwhite hart that lived in that forest, and if anyone killed it, he would\nbe hanged, she said. Such vivid pictures came to me that they might have\nbeen Mr. Shimerda’s memories, not yet faded out from the air in which\nthey had haunted him.\n\nIt had begun to grow dark when my household returned, and grandmother\nwas so tired that she went at once to bed. Jake and I got supper, and\nwhile we were washing the dishes he told me in loud whispers about the\nstate of things over at the Shimerdas’. Nobody could touch the body\nuntil the coroner came. If anyone did, something terrible would happen,\napparently. The dead man was frozen through, ‘just as stiff as a dressed\nturkey you hang out to freeze,’ Jake said. The horses and oxen would not\ngo into the barn until he was frozen so hard that there was no longer\nany smell of blood. They were stabled there now, with the dead man,\nbecause there was no other place to keep them. A lighted lantern was\nkept hanging over Mr. Shimerda’s head. Antonia and Ambrosch and the\nmother took turns going down to pray beside him. The crazy boy went with\nthem, because he did not feel the cold. I believed he felt cold as much\nas anyone else, but he liked to be thought insensible to it. He was\nalways coveting distinction, poor Marek!\n\nAmbrosch, Jake said, showed more human feeling than he would have\nsupposed him capable of, but he was chiefly concerned about getting a\npriest, and about his father’s soul, which he believed was in a place\nof torment and would remain there until his family and the priest had\nprayed a great deal for him. ‘As I understand it,’ Jake concluded, ‘it\nwill be a matter of years to pray his soul out of Purgatory, and right\nnow he’s in torment.’\n\n‘I don’t believe it,’ I said stoutly. ‘I almost know it isn’t true.’ I\ndid not, of course, say that I believed he had been in that very kitchen\nall afternoon, on his way back to his own country. Nevertheless, after\nI went to bed, this idea of punishment and Purgatory came back on me\ncrushingly. I remembered the account of Dives in torment, and shuddered.\nBut Mr. Shimerda had not been rich and selfish: he had only been so\nunhappy that he could not live any longer.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nOTTO FUCHS GOT back from Black Hawk at noon the next day. He reported\nthat the coroner would reach the Shimerdas’ sometime that afternoon,\nbut the missionary priest was at the other end of his parish, a hundred\nmiles away, and the trains were not running. Fuchs had got a few hours’\nsleep at the livery barn in town, but he was afraid the grey gelding had\nstrained himself. Indeed, he was never the same horse afterward. That\nlong trip through the deep snow had taken all the endurance out of him.\n\nFuchs brought home with him a stranger, a young Bohemian who had taken\na homestead near Black Hawk, and who came on his only horse to help his\nfellow countrymen in their trouble. That was the first time I ever saw\nAnton Jelinek. He was a strapping young fellow in the early twenties\nthen, handsome, warm-hearted, and full of life, and he came to us like\na miracle in the midst of that grim business. I remember exactly how he\nstrode into our kitchen in his felt boots and long wolfskin coat,\nhis eyes and cheeks bright with the cold. At sight of grandmother, he\nsnatched off his fur cap, greeting her in a deep, rolling voice which\nseemed older than he.\n\n‘I want to thank you very much, Mrs. Burden, for that you are so kind to\npoor strangers from my kawntree.’\n\nHe did not hesitate like a farmer boy, but looked one eagerly in the eye\nwhen he spoke. Everything about him was warm and spontaneous. He said\nhe would have come to see the Shimerdas before, but he had hired out to\nhusk corn all the fall, and since winter began he had been going to the\nschool by the mill, to learn English, along with the little children. He\ntold me he had a nice ‘lady-teacher’ and that he liked to go to school.\n\nAt dinner grandfather talked to Jelinek more than he usually did to\nstrangers.\n\n‘Will they be much disappointed because we cannot get a priest?’ he\nasked.\n\n\nJelinek looked serious.\n\n‘Yes, sir, that is very bad for them. Their father has done a great\nsin’--he looked straight at grandfather. ‘Our Lord has said that.’\n\nGrandfather seemed to like his frankness.\n\n‘We believe that, too, Jelinek. But we believe that Mr. Shimerda’s soul\nwill come to its Creator as well off without a priest. We believe that\nChrist is our only intercessor.’\n\nThe young man shook his head. ‘I know how you think. My teacher at the\nschool has explain. But I have seen too much. I believe in prayer for\nthe dead. I have seen too much.’\n\nWe asked him what he meant.\n\nHe glanced around the table. ‘You want I shall tell you? When I was a\nlittle boy like this one, I begin to help the priest at the altar. I\nmake my first communion very young; what the Church teach seem plain to\nme. By ‘n’ by war-times come, when the Prussians fight us. We have very\nmany soldiers in camp near my village, and the cholera break out in that\ncamp, and the men die like flies. All day long our priest go about\nthere to give the Sacrament to dying men, and I go with him to carry the\nvessels with the Holy Sacrament. Everybody that go near that camp catch\nthe sickness but me and the priest. But we have no sickness, we have\nno fear, because we carry that blood and that body of Christ, and it\npreserve us.’ He paused, looking at grandfather. ‘That I know, Mr.\nBurden, for it happened to myself. All the soldiers know, too. When\nwe walk along the road, the old priest and me, we meet all the time\nsoldiers marching and officers on horse. All those officers, when they\nsee what I carry under the cloth, pull up their horses and kneel down\non the ground in the road until we pass. So I feel very bad for my\nkawntree-man to die without the Sacrament, and to die in a bad way for\nhis soul, and I feel sad for his family.’\n\nWe had listened attentively. It was impossible not to admire his frank,\nmanly faith.\n\n‘I am always glad to meet a young man who thinks seriously about these\nthings,’ said grandfather, ‘and I would never be the one to say you were\nnot in God’s care when you were among the soldiers.’ After dinner it was\ndecided that young Jelinek should hook our two strong black farm-horses\nto the scraper and break a road through to the Shimerdas’, so that\na wagon could go when it was necessary. Fuchs, who was the only\ncabinetmaker in the neighbourhood was set to work on a coffin.\n\nJelinek put on his long wolfskin coat, and when we admired it, he told\nus that he had shot and skinned the coyotes, and the young man who\n‘batched’ with him, Jan Bouska, who had been a fur-worker in Vienna,\nmade the coat. From the windmill I watched Jelinek come out of the barn\nwith the blacks, and work his way up the hillside toward the cornfield.\nSometimes he was completely hidden by the clouds of snow that rose about\nhim; then he and the horses would emerge black and shining.\n\nOur heavy carpenter’s bench had to be brought from the barn and carried\ndown into the kitchen. Fuchs selected boards from a pile of planks\ngrandfather had hauled out from town in the fall to make a new floor for\nthe oats-bin. When at last the lumber and tools were assembled, and the\ndoors were closed again and the cold draughts shut out, grandfather rode\naway to meet the coroner at the Shimerdas’, and Fuchs took off his coat\nand settled down to work. I sat on his worktable and watched him. He did\nnot touch his tools at first, but figured for a long while on a piece of\npaper, and measured the planks and made marks on them. While he was\nthus engaged, he whistled softly to himself, or teasingly pulled at his\nhalf-ear. Grandmother moved about quietly, so as not to disturb him. At\nlast he folded his ruler and turned a cheerful face to us.\n\n‘The hardest part of my job’s done,’ he announced. ‘It’s the head end\nof it that comes hard with me, especially when I’m out of practice. The\nlast time I made one of these, Mrs. Burden,’ he continued, as he sorted\nand tried his chisels, ‘was for a fellow in the Black Tiger Mine, up\nabove Silverton, Colorado. The mouth of that mine goes right into the\nface of the cliff, and they used to put us in a bucket and run us over\non a trolley and shoot us into the shaft. The bucket travelled across a\nbox canon three hundred feet deep, and about a third full of water. Two\nSwedes had fell out of that bucket once, and hit the water, feet down.\nIf you’ll believe it, they went to work the next day. You can’t kill\na Swede. But in my time a little Eyetalian tried the high dive, and it\nturned out different with him. We was snowed in then, like we are now,\nand I happened to be the only man in camp that could make a coffin for\nhim. It’s a handy thing to know, when you knock about like I’ve done.’\n\n‘We’d be hard put to it now, if you didn’t know, Otto,’ grandmother\nsaid.\n\n\n‘Yes, ‘m,’ Fuchs admitted with modest pride. ‘So few folks does know\nhow to make a good tight box that’ll turn water. I sometimes wonder\nif there’ll be anybody about to do it for me. However, I’m not at all\nparticular that way.’\n\nAll afternoon, wherever one went in the house, one could hear the\npanting wheeze of the saw or the pleasant purring of the plane. They\nwere such cheerful noises, seeming to promise new things for living\npeople: it was a pity that those freshly planed pine boards were to be\nput underground so soon. The lumber was hard to work because it was full\nof frost, and the boards gave off a sweet smell of pine woods, as the\nheap of yellow shavings grew higher and higher. I wondered why Fuchs\nhad not stuck to cabinet-work, he settled down to it with such ease and\ncontent. He handled the tools as if he liked the feel of them; and when\nhe planed, his hands went back and forth over the boards in an eager,\nbeneficent way as if he were blessing them. He broke out now and then\ninto German hymns, as if this occupation brought back old times to him.\n\nAt four o’clock Mr. Bushy, the postmaster, with another neighbour who\nlived east of us, stopped in to get warm. They were on their way to the\nShimerdas’. The news of what had happened over there had somehow got\nabroad through the snow-blocked country. Grandmother gave the visitors\nsugar-cakes and hot coffee. Before these callers were gone, the brother\nof the Widow Steavens, who lived on the Black Hawk road, drew up at our\ndoor, and after him came the father of the German family, our\nnearest neighbours on the south. They dismounted and joined us in the\ndining-room. They were all eager for any details about the suicide, and\nthey were greatly concerned as to where Mr. Shimerda would be buried.\nThe nearest Catholic cemetery was at Black Hawk, and it might be weeks\nbefore a wagon could get so far. Besides, Mr. Bushy and grandmother were\nsure that a man who had killed himself could not be buried in a Catholic\ngraveyard. There was a burying-ground over by the Norwegian church, west\nof Squaw Creek; perhaps the Norwegians would take Mr. Shimerda in.\n\nAfter our visitors rode away in single file over the hill, we returned\nto the kitchen. Grandmother began to make the icing for a chocolate\ncake, and Otto again filled the house with the exciting, expectant song\nof the plane. One pleasant thing about this time was that everybody\ntalked more than usual. I had never heard the postmaster say anything\nbut ‘Only papers, to-day,’ or, ‘I’ve got a sackful of mail for ye,’\nuntil this afternoon. Grandmother always talked, dear woman: to herself\nor to the Lord, if there was no one else to listen; but grandfather was\nnaturally taciturn, and Jake and Otto were often so tired after supper\nthat I used to feel as if I were surrounded by a wall of silence. Now\neveryone seemed eager to talk. That afternoon Fuchs told me story after\nstory: about the Black Tiger Mine, and about violent deaths and casual\nburyings, and the queer fancies of dying men. You never really knew\na man, he said, until you saw him die. Most men were game, and went\nwithout a grudge.\n\nThe postmaster, going home, stopped to say that grandfather would\nbring the coroner back with him to spend the night. The officers of the\nNorwegian church, he told us, had held a meeting and decided that the\nNorwegian graveyard could not extend its hospitality to Mr. Shimerda.\n\nGrandmother was indignant. ‘If these foreigners are so clannish, Mr.\nBushy, we’ll have to have an American graveyard that will be more\nliberal-minded. I’ll get right after Josiah to start one in the spring.\nIf anything was to happen to me, I don’t want the Norwegians holding\ninquisitions over me to see whether I’m good enough to be laid amongst\n‘em.’\n\nSoon grandfather returned, bringing with him Anton Jelinek, and that\nimportant person, the coroner. He was a mild, flurried old man, a Civil\nWar veteran, with one sleeve hanging empty. He seemed to find this case\nvery perplexing, and said if it had not been for grandfather he would\nhave sworn out a warrant against Krajiek. ‘The way he acted, and the way\nhis axe fit the wound, was enough to convict any man.’\n\nAlthough it was perfectly clear that Mr. Shimerda had killed himself,\nJake and the coroner thought something ought to be done to Krajiek\nbecause he behaved like a guilty man. He was badly frightened,\ncertainly, and perhaps he even felt some stirrings of remorse for his\nindifference to the old man’s misery and loneliness.\n\nAt supper the men ate like vikings, and the chocolate cake, which I\nhad hoped would linger on until tomorrow in a mutilated condition,\ndisappeared on the second round. They talked excitedly about where\nthey should bury Mr. Shimerda; I gathered that the neighbours were all\ndisturbed and shocked about something. It developed that Mrs. Shimerda\nand Ambrosch wanted the old man buried on the southwest corner of\ntheir own land; indeed, under the very stake that marked the corner.\nGrandfather had explained to Ambrosch that some day, when the country\nwas put under fence and the roads were confined to section lines, two\nroads would cross exactly on that corner. But Ambrosch only said, ‘It\nmakes no matter.’\n\nGrandfather asked Jelinek whether in the old country there was some\nsuperstition to the effect that a suicide must be buried at the\ncross-roads.\n\nJelinek said he didn’t know; he seemed to remember hearing there had\nonce been such a custom in Bohemia. ‘Mrs. Shimerda is made up her mind,’\nhe added. ‘I try to persuade her, and say it looks bad for her to all\nthe neighbours; but she say so it must be. “There I will bury him, if\nI dig the grave myself,” she say. I have to promise her I help Ambrosch\nmake the grave tomorrow.’\n\nGrandfather smoothed his beard and looked judicial. ‘I don’t know whose\nwish should decide the matter, if not hers. But if she thinks she will\nlive to see the people of this country ride over that old man’s head,\nshe is mistaken.’\n\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nMR. SHIMERDA LAY DEAD in the barn four days, and on the fifth they\nburied him. All day Friday Jelinek was off with Ambrosch digging the\ngrave, chopping out the frozen earth with old axes. On Saturday we\nbreakfasted before daylight and got into the wagon with the coffin. Jake\nand Jelinek went ahead on horseback to cut the body loose from the pool\nof blood in which it was frozen fast to the ground.\n\nWhen grandmother and I went into the Shimerdas’ house, we found the\nwomenfolk alone; Ambrosch and Marek were at the barn. Mrs. Shimerda sat\ncrouching by the stove, Antonia was washing dishes. When she saw me, she\nran out of her dark corner and threw her arms around me. ‘Oh, Jimmy,’\nshe sobbed, ‘what you tink for my lovely papa!’ It seemed to me that I\ncould feel her heart breaking as she clung to me.\n\nMrs. Shimerda, sitting on the stump by the stove, kept looking over her\nshoulder toward the door while the neighbours were arriving. They came\non horseback, all except the postmaster, who brought his family in a\nwagon over the only broken wagon-trail. The Widow Steavens rode up from\nher farm eight miles down the Black Hawk road. The cold drove the women\ninto the cave-house, and it was soon crowded. A fine, sleety snow was\nbeginning to fall, and everyone was afraid of another storm and anxious\nto have the burial over with.\n\nGrandfather and Jelinek came to tell Mrs. Shimerda that it was time\nto start. After bundling her mother up in clothes the neighbours had\nbrought, Antonia put on an old cape from our house and the rabbit-skin\nhat her father had made for her. Four men carried Mr. Shimerda’s box up\nthe hill; Krajiek slunk along behind them. The coffin was too wide for\nthe door, so it was put down on the slope outside. I slipped out from\nthe cave and looked at Mr. Shimerda. He was lying on his side, with his\nknees drawn up. His body was draped in a black shawl, and his head was\nbandaged in white muslin, like a mummy’s; one of his long, shapely hands\nlay out on the black cloth; that was all one could see of him.\n\nMrs. Shimerda came out and placed an open prayer-book against the body,\nmaking the sign of the cross on the bandaged head with her fingers.\nAmbrosch knelt down and made the same gesture, and after him Antonia and\nMarek. Yulka hung back. Her mother pushed her forward, and kept saying\nsomething to her over and over. Yulka knelt down, shut her eyes, and put\nout her hand a little way, but she drew it back and began to cry wildly.\nShe was afraid to touch the bandage. Mrs. Shimerda caught her by the\nshoulders and pushed her toward the coffin, but grandmother interfered.\n\n‘No, Mrs. Shimerda,’ she said firmly, ‘I won’t stand by and see that\nchild frightened into spasms. She is too little to understand what you\nwant of her. Let her alone.’\n\nAt a look from grandfather, Fuchs and Jelinek placed the lid on the box,\nand began to nail it down over Mr. Shimerda. I was afraid to look at\nAntonia. She put her arms round Yulka and held the little girl close to\nher.\n\nThe coffin was put into the wagon. We drove slowly away, against the\nfine, icy snow which cut our faces like a sand-blast. When we reached\nthe grave, it looked a very little spot in that snow-covered waste. The\nmen took the coffin to the edge of the hole and lowered it with ropes.\nWe stood about watching them, and the powdery snow lay without melting\non the caps and shoulders of the men and the shawls of the women.\nJelinek spoke in a persuasive tone to Mrs. Shimerda, and then turned to\ngrandfather.\n\n‘She says, Mr. Burden, she is very glad if you can make some prayer for\nhim here in English, for the neighbours to understand.’\n\nGrandmother looked anxiously at grandfather. He took off his hat, and\nthe other men did likewise. I thought his prayer remarkable. I still\nremember it. He began, ‘Oh, great and just God, no man among us knows\nwhat the sleeper knows, nor is it for us to judge what lies between him\nand Thee.’ He prayed that if any man there had been remiss toward the\nstranger come to a far country, God would forgive him and soften his\nheart. He recalled the promises to the widow and the fatherless, and\nasked God to smooth the way before this widow and her children, and to\n‘incline the hearts of men to deal justly with her.’ In closing, he said\nwe were leaving Mr. Shimerda at ‘Thy judgment seat, which is also Thy\nmercy seat.’\n\nAll the time he was praying, grandmother watched him through the black\nfingers of her glove, and when he said ‘Amen,’ I thought she looked\nsatisfied with him. She turned to Otto and whispered, ‘Can’t you start a\nhymn, Fuchs? It would seem less heathenish.’\n\nFuchs glanced about to see if there was general approval of her\nsuggestion, then began, ‘Jesus, Lover of my Soul,’ and all the men and\nwomen took it up after him. Whenever I have heard the hymn since, it has\nmade me remember that white waste and the little group of people; and\nthe bluish air, full of fine, eddying snow, like long veils flying:\n\n‘While the nearer waters roll, While the tempest still is high.’\n\nYears afterward, when the open-grazing days were over, and the red grass\nhad been ploughed under and under until it had almost disappeared from\nthe prairie; when all the fields were under fence, and the roads\nno longer ran about like wild things, but followed the surveyed\nsection-lines, Mr. Shimerda’s grave was still there, with a sagging\nwire fence around it, and an unpainted wooden cross. As grandfather had\npredicted, Mrs. Shimerda never saw the roads going over his head. The\nroad from the north curved a little to the east just there, and the road\nfrom the west swung out a little to the south; so that the grave, with\nits tall red grass that was never mowed, was like a little island; and\nat twilight, under a new moon or the clear evening star, the dusty roads\nused to look like soft grey rivers flowing past it. I never came upon\nthe place without emotion, and in all that country it was the spot most\ndear to me. I loved the dim superstition, the propitiatory intent, that\nhad put the grave there; and still more I loved the spirit that could\nnot carry out the sentence--the error from the surveyed lines, the\nclemency of the soft earth roads along which the home-coming wagons\nrattled after sunset. Never a tired driver passed the wooden cross, I am\nsure, without wishing well to the sleeper.\n\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nWHEN SPRING CAME, AFTER that hard winter, one could not get enough of\nthe nimble air. Every morning I wakened with a fresh consciousness that\nwinter was over. There were none of the signs of spring for which I used\nto watch in Virginia, no budding woods or blooming gardens. There was\nonly--spring itself; the throb of it, the light restlessness, the vital\nessence of it everywhere: in the sky, in the swift clouds, in the pale\nsunshine, and in the warm, high wind--rising suddenly, sinking suddenly,\nimpulsive and playful like a big puppy that pawed you and then lay down\nto be petted. If I had been tossed down blindfold on that red prairie, I\nshould have known that it was spring.\n\nEverywhere now there was the smell of burning grass. Our neighbours\nburned off their pasture before the new grass made a start, so that the\nfresh growth would not be mixed with the dead stand of last year. Those\nlight, swift fires, running about the country, seemed a part of the same\nkindling that was in the air.\n\nThe Shimerdas were in their new log house by then. The neighbours had\nhelped them to build it in March. It stood directly in front of their\nold cave, which they used as a cellar. The family were now fairly\nequipped to begin their struggle with the soil. They had four\ncomfortable rooms to live in, a new windmill--bought on credit--a\nchicken-house and poultry. Mrs. Shimerda had paid grandfather ten\ndollars for a milk cow, and was to give him fifteen more as soon as they\nharvested their first crop.\n\nWhen I rode up to the Shimerdas’ one bright windy afternoon in April,\nYulka ran out to meet me. It was to her, now, that I gave reading\nlessons; Antonia was busy with other things. I tied my pony and went\ninto the kitchen where Mrs. Shimerda was baking bread, chewing poppy\nseeds as she worked. By this time she could speak enough English to ask\nme a great many questions about what our men were doing in the fields.\nShe seemed to think that my elders withheld helpful information, and\nthat from me she might get valuable secrets. On this occasion she asked\nme very craftily when grandfather expected to begin planting corn. I\ntold her, adding that he thought we should have a dry spring and that\nthe corn would not be held back by too much rain, as it had been last\nyear.\n\nShe gave me a shrewd glance. ‘He not Jesus,’ she blustered; ‘he not know\nabout the wet and the dry.\n\nI did not answer her; what was the use? As I sat waiting for the hour\nwhen Ambrosch and Antonia would return from the fields, I watched Mrs.\nShimerda at her work. She took from the oven a coffee-cake which she\nwanted to keep warm for supper, and wrapped it in a quilt stuffed with\nfeathers. I have seen her put even a roast goose in this quilt to keep\nit hot. When the neighbours were there building the new house, they saw\nher do this, and the story got abroad that the Shimerdas kept their food\nin their featherbeds.\n\n\nWhen the sun was dropping low, Antonia came up the big south draw with\nher team. How much older she had grown in eight months! She had come\nto us a child, and now she was a tall, strong young girl, although her\nfifteenth birthday had just slipped by. I ran out and met her as she\nbrought her horses up to the windmill to water them. She wore the boots\nher father had so thoughtfully taken off before he shot himself, and his\nold fur cap. Her outgrown cotton dress switched about her calves, over\nthe boot-tops. She kept her sleeves rolled up all day, and her arms and\nthroat were burned as brown as a sailor’s. Her neck came up strongly out\nof her shoulders, like the bole of a tree out of the turf. One sees that\ndraught-horse neck among the peasant women in all old countries.\n\nShe greeted me gaily, and began at once to tell me how much ploughing\nshe had done that day. Ambrosch, she said, was on the north quarter,\nbreaking sod with the oxen.\n\n‘Jim, you ask Jake how much he ploughed to-day. I don’t want that Jake\nget more done in one day than me. I want we have very much corn this\nfall.’\n\nWhile the horses drew in the water, and nosed each other, and then drank\nagain, Antonia sat down on the windmill step and rested her head on her\nhand.\n\n‘You see the big prairie fire from your place last night? I hope your\ngrandpa ain’t lose no stacks?’\n\n‘No, we didn’t. I came to ask you something, Tony. Grandmother wants to\nknow if you can’t go to the term of school that begins next week over at\nthe sod schoolhouse. She says there’s a good teacher, and you’d learn a\nlot.’\n\nAntonia stood up, lifting and dropping her shoulders as if they were\nstiff. ‘I ain’t got time to learn. I can work like mans now. My mother\ncan’t say no more how Ambrosch do all and nobody to help him. I can work\nas much as him. School is all right for little boys. I help make this\nland one good farm.’\n\nShe clucked to her team and started for the barn. I walked beside her,\nfeeling vexed. Was she going to grow up boastful like her mother, I\nwondered? Before we reached the stable, I felt something tense in her\nsilence, and glancing up I saw that she was crying. She turned her face\nfrom me and looked off at the red streak of dying light, over the dark\nprairie.\n\nI climbed up into the loft and threw down the hay for her, while she\nunharnessed her team. We walked slowly back toward the house. Ambrosch\nhad come in from the north quarter, and was watering his oxen at the\ntank.\n\n\nAntonia took my hand. ‘Sometime you will tell me all those nice things\nyou learn at the school, won’t you, Jimmy?’ she asked with a sudden rush\nof feeling in her voice. ‘My father, he went much to school. He know a\ngreat deal; how to make the fine cloth like what you not got here. He\nplay horn and violin, and he read so many books that the priests in\nBohemie come to talk to him. You won’t forget my father, Jim?’ ‘No,’ I\nsaid, ‘I will never forget him.’\n\nMrs. Shimerda asked me to stay for supper. After Ambrosch and Antonia\nhad washed the field dust from their hands and faces at the wash-basin\nby the kitchen door, we sat down at the oilcloth-covered table. Mrs.\nShimerda ladled meal mush out of an iron pot and poured milk on it.\nAfter the mush we had fresh bread and sorghum molasses, and coffee with\nthe cake that had been kept warm in the feathers. Antonia and Ambrosch\nwere talking in Bohemian; disputing about which of them had done more\nploughing that day. Mrs. Shimerda egged them on, chuckling while she\ngobbled her food.\n\nPresently Ambrosch said sullenly in English: ‘You take them ox tomorrow\nand try the sod plough. Then you not be so smart.’\n\nHis sister laughed. ‘Don’t be mad. I know it’s awful hard work for break\nsod. I milk the cow for you tomorrow, if you want.’\n\nMrs. Shimerda turned quickly to me. ‘That cow not give so much milk like\nwhat your grandpa say. If he make talk about fifteen dollars, I send him\nback the cow.’\n\n‘He doesn’t talk about the fifteen dollars,’ I exclaimed indignantly.\n‘He doesn’t find fault with people.’\n\n‘He say I break his saw when we build, and I never,’ grumbled Ambrosch.\n\nI knew he had broken the saw, and then hid it and lied about it. I began\nto wish I had not stayed for supper. Everything was disagreeable to\nme. Antonia ate so noisily now, like a man, and she yawned often at\nthe table and kept stretching her arms over her head, as if they ached.\nGrandmother had said, ‘Heavy field work’ll spoil that girl. She’ll lose\nall her nice ways and get rough ones.’ She had lost them already.\n\nAfter supper I rode home through the sad, soft spring twilight. Since\nwinter I had seen very little of Antonia. She was out in the fields from\nsunup until sundown. If I rode over to see her where she was ploughing,\nshe stopped at the end of a row to chat for a moment, then gripped\nher plough-handles, clucked to her team, and waded on down the furrow,\nmaking me feel that she was now grown up and had no time for me. On\nSundays she helped her mother make garden or sewed all day. Grandfather\nwas pleased with Antonia. When we complained of her, he only smiled and\nsaid, ‘She will help some fellow get ahead in the world.’\n\nNowadays Tony could talk of nothing but the prices of things, or how\nmuch she could lift and endure. She was too proud of her strength. I\nknew, too, that Ambrosch put upon her some chores a girl ought not to\ndo, and that the farm-hands around the country joked in a nasty way\nabout it. Whenever I saw her come up the furrow, shouting to her beasts,\nsunburned, sweaty, her dress open at the neck, and her throat and chest\ndust-plastered, I used to think of the tone in which poor Mr. Shimerda,\nwho could say so little, yet managed to say so much when he exclaimed,\n‘My Antonia!’\n\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nAFTER I BEGAN TO go to the country school, I saw less of the Bohemians.\nWe were sixteen pupils at the sod schoolhouse, and we all came on\nhorseback and brought our dinner. My schoolmates were none of them very\ninteresting, but I somehow felt that, by making comrades of them, I\nwas getting even with Antonia for her indifference. Since the father’s\ndeath, Ambrosch was more than ever the head of the house, and he seemed\nto direct the feelings as well as the fortunes of his womenfolk. Antonia\noften quoted his opinions to me, and she let me see that she admired\nhim, while she thought of me only as a little boy. Before the spring\nwas over, there was a distinct coldness between us and the Shimerdas. It\ncame about in this way.\n\n\nOne Sunday I rode over there with Jake to get a horse-collar which\nAmbrosch had borrowed from him and had not returned. It was a beautiful\nblue morning. The buffalo-peas were blooming in pink and purple\nmasses along the roadside, and the larks, perched on last year’s dried\nsunflower stalks, were singing straight at the sun, their heads thrown\nback and their yellow breasts a-quiver. The wind blew about us in warm,\nsweet gusts. We rode slowly, with a pleasant sense of Sunday indolence.\n\nWe found the Shimerdas working just as if it were a week-day. Marek was\ncleaning out the stable, and Antonia and her mother were making garden,\noff across the pond in the draw-head. Ambrosch was up on the windmill\ntower, oiling the wheel. He came down, not very cordially. When Jake\nasked for the collar, he grunted and scratched his head. The collar\nbelonged to grandfather, of course, and Jake, feeling responsible for\nit, flared up. ‘Now, don’t you say you haven’t got it, Ambrosch, because\nI know you have, and if you ain’t a-going to look for it, I will.’\n\nAmbrosch shrugged his shoulders and sauntered down the hill toward\nthe stable. I could see that it was one of his mean days. Presently he\nreturned, carrying a collar that had been badly used--trampled in the\ndirt and gnawed by rats until the hair was sticking out of it.\n\n‘This what you want?’ he asked surlily.\n\nJake jumped off his horse. I saw a wave of red come up under the rough\nstubble on his face. ‘That ain’t the piece of harness I loaned you,\nAmbrosch; or, if it is, you’ve used it shameful. I ain’t a-going to\ncarry such a looking thing back to Mr. Burden.’\n\nAmbrosch dropped the collar on the ground. ‘All right,’ he said coolly,\ntook up his oil-can, and began to climb the mill. Jake caught him by the\nbelt of his trousers and yanked him back. Ambrosch’s feet had scarcely\ntouched the ground when he lunged out with a vicious kick at Jake’s\nstomach. Fortunately, Jake was in such a position that he could dodge\nit. This was not the sort of thing country boys did when they played\nat fisticuffs, and Jake was furious. He landed Ambrosch a blow on the\nhead--it sounded like the crack of an axe on a cow-pumpkin. Ambrosch\ndropped over, stunned.\n\nWe heard squeals, and looking up saw Antonia and her mother coming on\nthe run. They did not take the path around the pond, but plunged through\nthe muddy water, without even lifting their skirts. They came on,\nscreaming and clawing the air. By this time Ambrosch had come to his\nsenses and was sputtering with nosebleed.\n\nJake sprang into his saddle. ‘Let’s get out of this, Jim,’ he called.\n\nMrs. Shimerda threw her hands over her head and clutched as if she were\ngoing to pull down lightning. ‘Law, law!’ she shrieked after us. ‘Law\nfor knock my Ambrosch down!’\n\n‘I never like you no more, Jake and Jim Burden,’ Antonia panted. ‘No\nfriends any more!’\n\nJake stopped and turned his horse for a second. ‘Well, you’re a damned\nungrateful lot, the whole pack of you,’ he shouted back. ‘I guess the\nBurdens can get along without you. You’ve been a sight of trouble to\nthem, anyhow!’\n\nWe rode away, feeling so outraged that the fine morning was spoiled\nfor us. I hadn’t a word to say, and poor Jake was white as paper and\ntrembling all over. It made him sick to get so angry.\n\n‘They ain’t the same, Jimmy,’ he kept saying in a hurt tone. ‘These\nforeigners ain’t the same. You can’t trust ‘em to be fair. It’s dirty to\nkick a feller. You heard how the women turned on you--and after all we\nwent through on account of ‘em last winter! They ain’t to be trusted. I\ndon’t want to see you get too thick with any of ‘em.’\n\n‘I’ll never be friends with them again, Jake,’ I declared hotly. ‘I\nbelieve they are all like Krajiek and Ambrosch underneath.’\n\nGrandfather heard our story with a twinkle in his eye. He advised Jake\nto ride to town tomorrow, go to a justice of the peace, tell him he had\nknocked young Shimerda down, and pay his fine. Then if Mrs. Shimerda\nwas inclined to make trouble--her son was still under age--she would\nbe forestalled. Jake said he might as well take the wagon and haul to\nmarket the pig he had been fattening. On Monday, about an hour after\nJake had started, we saw Mrs. Shimerda and her Ambrosch proudly driving\nby, looking neither to the right nor left. As they rattled out of sight\ndown the Black Hawk road, grandfather chuckled, saying he had rather\nexpected she would follow the matter up.\n\nJake paid his fine with a ten-dollar bill grandfather had given him for\nthat purpose. But when the Shimerdas found that Jake sold his pig in\ntown that day, Ambrosch worked it out in his shrewd head that Jake had\nto sell his pig to pay his fine. This theory afforded the Shimerdas\ngreat satisfaction, apparently. For weeks afterward, whenever Jake and I\nmet Antonia on her way to the post-office, or going along the road with\nher work-team, she would clap her hands and call to us in a spiteful,\ncrowing voice:\n\n‘Jake-y, Jake-y, sell the pig and pay the slap!’\n\nOtto pretended not to be surprised at Antonia’s behaviour. He only\nlifted his brows and said, ‘You can’t tell me anything new about a\nCzech; I’m an Austrian.’\n\nGrandfather was never a party to what Jake called our feud with the\nShimerdas. Ambrosch and Antonia always greeted him respectfully, and he\nasked them about their affairs and gave them advice as usual. He thought\nthe future looked hopeful for them. Ambrosch was a far-seeing fellow; he\nsoon realized that his oxen were too heavy for any work except breaking\nsod, and he succeeded in selling them to a newly arrived German. With\nthe money he bought another team of horses, which grandfather selected\nfor him. Marek was strong, and Ambrosch worked him hard; but he could\nnever teach him to cultivate corn, I remember. The one idea that had\never got through poor Marek’s thick head was that all exertion was\nmeritorious. He always bore down on the handles of the cultivator\nand drove the blades so deep into the earth that the horses were soon\nexhausted.\n\nIn June, Ambrosch went to work at Mr. Bushy’s for a week, and took Marek\nwith him at full wages. Mrs. Shimerda then drove the second cultivator;\nshe and Antonia worked in the fields all day and did the chores at\nnight. While the two women were running the place alone, one of the new\nhorses got colic and gave them a terrible fright.\n\nAntonia had gone down to the barn one night to see that all was well\nbefore she went to bed, and she noticed that one of the roans was\nswollen about the middle and stood with its head hanging. She mounted\nanother horse, without waiting to saddle him, and hammered on our door\njust as we were going to bed. Grandfather answered her knock. He did not\nsend one of his men, but rode back with her himself, taking a syringe\nand an old piece of carpet he kept for hot applications when our horses\nwere sick. He found Mrs. Shimerda sitting by the horse with her lantern,\ngroaning and wringing her hands. It took but a few moments to release\nthe gases pent up in the poor beast, and the two women heard the rush of\nwind and saw the roan visibly diminish in girth.\n\n‘If I lose that horse, Mr. Burden,’ Antonia exclaimed, ‘I never stay\nhere till Ambrosch come home! I go drown myself in the pond before\nmorning.’\n\nWhen Ambrosch came back from Mr. Bushy’s, we learned that he had given\nMarek’s wages to the priest at Black Hawk, for Masses for their father’s\nsoul. Grandmother thought Antonia needed shoes more than Mr. Shimerda\nneeded prayers, but grandfather said tolerantly, ‘If he can spare six\ndollars, pinched as he is, it shows he believes what he professes.’\n\nIt was grandfather who brought about a reconciliation with the\nShimerdas. One morning he told us that the small grain was coming on so\nwell, he thought he would begin to cut his wheat on the first of July.\nHe would need more men, and if it were agreeable to everyone he would\nengage Ambrosch for the reaping and threshing, as the Shimerdas had no\nsmall grain of their own.\n\n‘I think, Emmaline,’ he concluded, ‘I will ask Antonia to come over and\nhelp you in the kitchen. She will be glad to earn something, and it will\nbe a good time to end misunderstandings. I may as well ride over this\nmorning and make arrangements. Do you want to go with me, Jim?’ His tone\ntold me that he had already decided for me.\n\nAfter breakfast we set off together. When Mrs. Shimerda saw us coming,\nshe ran from her door down into the draw behind the stable, as if she\ndid not want to meet us. Grandfather smiled to himself while he tied his\nhorse, and we followed her.\n\nBehind the barn we came upon a funny sight. The cow had evidently been\ngrazing somewhere in the draw. Mrs. Shimerda had run to the animal,\npulled up the lariat pin, and, when we came upon her, she was trying\nto hide the cow in an old cave in the bank. As the hole was narrow and\ndark, the cow held back, and the old woman was slapping and pushing at\nher hind quarters, trying to spank her into the drawside.\n\nGrandfather ignored her singular occupation and greeted her politely.\n‘Good morning, Mrs. Shimerda. Can you tell me where I will find\nAmbrosch? Which field?’\n\n‘He with the sod corn.’ She pointed toward the north, still standing in\nfront of the cow as if she hoped to conceal it.\n\n‘His sod corn will be good for fodder this winter,’ said grandfather\nencouragingly. ‘And where is Antonia?’\n\n‘She go with.’ Mrs. Shimerda kept wiggling her bare feet about nervously\nin the dust.\n\n‘Very well. I will ride up there. I want them to come over and help me\ncut my oats and wheat next month. I will pay them wages. Good morning.\nBy the way, Mrs. Shimerda,’ he said as he turned up the path, ‘I think\nwe may as well call it square about the cow.’\n\nShe started and clutched the rope tighter. Seeing that she did not\nunderstand, grandfather turned back. ‘You need not pay me anything more;\nno more money. The cow is yours.’\n\n‘Pay no more, keep cow?’ she asked in a bewildered tone, her narrow eyes\nsnapping at us in the sunlight.\n\n‘Exactly. Pay no more, keep cow.’ He nodded.\n\nMrs. Shimerda dropped the rope, ran after us, and, crouching down beside\ngrandfather, she took his hand and kissed it. I doubt if he had ever\nbeen so much embarrassed before. I was a little startled, too. Somehow,\nthat seemed to bring the Old World very close.\n\nWe rode away laughing, and grandfather said: ‘I expect she thought we\nhad come to take the cow away for certain, Jim. I wonder if she wouldn’t\nhave scratched a little if we’d laid hold of that lariat rope!’\n\nOur neighbours seemed glad to make peace with us. The next Sunday Mrs.\nShimerda came over and brought Jake a pair of socks she had knitted. She\npresented them with an air of great magnanimity, saying, ‘Now you not\ncome any more for knock my Ambrosch down?’\n\nJake laughed sheepishly. ‘I don’t want to have no trouble with Ambrosch.\nIf he’ll let me alone, I’ll let him alone.’\n\n‘If he slap you, we ain’t got no pig for pay the fine,’ she said\ninsinuatingly.\n\nJake was not at all disconcerted. ‘Have the last word ma’m,’ he said\ncheerfully. ‘It’s a lady’s privilege.’\n\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nJULY CAME ON with that breathless, brilliant heat which makes the plains\nof Kansas and Nebraska the best corn country in the world. It seemed\nas if we could hear the corn growing in the night; under the stars one\ncaught a faint crackling in the dewy, heavy-odoured cornfields where the\nfeathered stalks stood so juicy and green. If all the great plain from\nthe Missouri to the Rocky Mountains had been under glass, and the heat\nregulated by a thermometer, it could not have been better for the yellow\ntassels that were ripening and fertilizing the silk day by day. The\ncornfields were far apart in those times, with miles of wild grazing\nland between. It took a clear, meditative eye like my grandfather’s to\nforesee that they would enlarge and multiply until they would be, not\nthe Shimerdas’ cornfields, or Mr. Bushy’s, but the world’s cornfields;\nthat their yield would be one of the great economic facts, like the\nwheat crop of Russia, which underlie all the activities of men, in peace\nor war.\n\nThe burning sun of those few weeks, with occasional rains at night,\nsecured the corn. After the milky ears were once formed, we had\nlittle to fear from dry weather. The men were working so hard in the\nwheatfields that they did not notice the heat--though I was kept busy\ncarrying water for them--and grandmother and Antonia had so much to do\nin the kitchen that they could not have told whether one day was hotter\nthan another. Each morning, while the dew was still on the grass,\nAntonia went with me up to the garden to get early vegetables for\ndinner. Grandmother made her wear a sunbonnet, but as soon as we reached\nthe garden she threw it on the grass and let her hair fly in the breeze.\nI remember how, as we bent over the pea-vines, beads of perspiration\nused to gather on her upper lip like a little moustache.\n\n‘Oh, better I like to work out-of-doors than in a house!’ she used to\nsing joyfully. ‘I not care that your grandmother say it makes me like\na man. I like to be like a man.’ She would toss her head and ask me to\nfeel the muscles swell in her brown arm.\n\nWe were glad to have her in the house. She was so gay and responsive\nthat one did not mind her heavy, running step, or her clattery way with\npans. Grandmother was in high spirits during the weeks that Antonia\nworked for us.\n\nAll the nights were close and hot during that harvest season. The\nharvesters slept in the hayloft because it was cooler there than in the\nhouse. I used to lie in my bed by the open window, watching the heat\nlightning play softly along the horizon, or looking up at the gaunt\nframe of the windmill against the blue night sky. One night there was a\nbeautiful electric storm, though not enough rain fell to damage the cut\ngrain. The men went down to the barn immediately after supper, and when\nthe dishes were washed, Antonia and I climbed up on the slanting roof\nof the chicken-house to watch the clouds. The thunder was loud and\nmetallic, like the rattle of sheet iron, and the lightning broke in\ngreat zigzags across the heavens, making everything stand out and\ncome close to us for a moment. Half the sky was chequered with black\nthunderheads, but all the west was luminous and clear: in the lightning\nflashes it looked like deep blue water, with the sheen of moonlight on\nit; and the mottled part of the sky was like marble pavement, like the\nquay of some splendid seacoast city, doomed to destruction. Great warm\nsplashes of rain fell on our upturned faces. One black cloud, no bigger\nthan a little boat, drifted out into the clear space unattended, and\nkept moving westward. All about us we could hear the felty beat of the\nraindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard. Grandmother came to the door\nand said it was late, and we would get wet out there.\n\n‘In a minute we come,’ Antonia called back to her. ‘I like your\ngrandmother, and all things here,’ she sighed. ‘I wish my papa live to\nsee this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.’\n\n‘It will be summer a long while yet,’ I reassured her. ‘Why aren’t you\nalways nice like this, Tony?’\n\n‘How nice?’\n\n‘Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be\nlike Ambrosch?’\n\nShe put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. ‘If\nI live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you.\nBut they will be hard for us.’\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK II. The Hired Girls\n\n\n\n\nI\n\n\nI HAD BEEN LIVING with my grandfather for nearly three years when he\ndecided to move to Black Hawk. He and grandmother were getting old for\nthe heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought\nto be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to ‘that\ngood woman, the Widow Steavens,’ and her bachelor brother, and we bought\nPreacher White’s house, at the north end of Black Hawk. This was the\nfirst town house one passed driving in from the farm, a landmark which\ntold country people their long ride was over.\n\nWe were to move to Black Hawk in March, and as soon as grandfather had\nfixed the date he let Jake and Otto know of his intention. Otto said he\nwould not be likely to find another place that suited him so well; that\nhe was tired of farming and thought he would go back to what he called\nthe ‘wild West.’ Jake Marpole, lured by Otto’s stories of adventure,\ndecided to go with him. We did our best to dissuade Jake. He was so\nhandicapped by illiteracy and by his trusting disposition that he\nwould be an easy prey to sharpers. Grandmother begged him to stay among\nkindly, Christian people, where he was known; but there was no reasoning\nwith him. He wanted to be a prospector. He thought a silver mine was\nwaiting for him in Colorado.\n\nJake and Otto served us to the last. They moved us into town, put\ndown the carpets in our new house, made shelves and cupboards for\ngrandmother’s kitchen, and seemed loath to leave us. But at last they\nwent, without warning. Those two fellows had been faithful to us through\nsun and storm, had given us things that cannot be bought in any market\nin the world. With me they had been like older brothers; had restrained\ntheir speech and manners out of care for me, and given me so much good\ncomradeship. Now they got on the westbound train one morning, in their\nSunday clothes, with their oilcloth valises--and I never saw them again.\nMonths afterward we got a card from Otto, saying that Jake had been down\nwith mountain fever, but now they were both working in the Yankee Girl\nMine, and were doing well. I wrote to them at that address, but my\nletter was returned to me, ‘Unclaimed.’ After that we never heard from\nthem.\n\nBlack Hawk, the new world in which we had come to live, was a clean,\nwell-planted little prairie town, with white fences and good green\nyards about the dwellings, wide, dusty streets, and shapely little trees\ngrowing along the wooden sidewalks. In the centre of the town there\nwere two rows of new brick ‘store’ buildings, a brick schoolhouse, the\ncourt-house, and four white churches. Our own house looked down over the\ntown, and from our upstairs windows we could see the winding line of\nthe river bluffs, two miles south of us. That river was to be my\ncompensation for the lost freedom of the farming country.\n\nWe came to Black Hawk in March, and by the end of April we felt like\ntown people. Grandfather was a deacon in the new Baptist Church,\ngrandmother was busy with church suppers and missionary societies, and I\nwas quite another boy, or thought I was. Suddenly put down among boys of\nmy own age, I found I had a great deal to learn. Before the spring term\nof school was over, I could fight, play ‘keeps,’ tease the little girls,\nand use forbidden words as well as any boy in my class. I was restrained\nfrom utter savagery only by the fact that Mrs. Harling, our nearest\nneighbour, kept an eye on me, and if my behaviour went beyond certain\nbounds I was not permitted to come into her yard or to play with her\njolly children.\n\nWe saw more of our country neighbours now than when we lived on the\nfarm. Our house was a convenient stopping-place for them. We had a big\nbarn where the farmers could put up their teams, and their womenfolk\nmore often accompanied them, now that they could stay with us for\ndinner, and rest and set their bonnets right before they went shopping.\nThe more our house was like a country hotel, the better I liked it.\nI was glad, when I came home from school at noon, to see a farm-wagon\nstanding in the back yard, and I was always ready to run downtown to\nget beefsteak or baker’s bread for unexpected company. All through that\nfirst spring and summer I kept hoping that Ambrosch would bring Antonia\nand Yulka to see our new house. I wanted to show them our red plush\nfurniture, and the trumpet-blowing cherubs the German paperhanger had\nput on our parlour ceiling.\n\nWhen Ambrosch came to town, however, he came alone, and though he put\nhis horses in our barn, he would never stay for dinner, or tell us\nanything about his mother and sisters. If we ran out and questioned him\nas he was slipping through the yard, he would merely work his shoulders\nabout in his coat and say, ‘They all right, I guess.’\n\nMrs. Steavens, who now lived on our farm, grew as fond of Antonia as\nwe had been, and always brought us news of her. All through the wheat\nseason, she told us, Ambrosch hired his sister out like a man, and she\nwent from farm to farm, binding sheaves or working with the threshers.\nThe farmers liked her and were kind to her; said they would rather have\nher for a hand than Ambrosch. When fall came she was to husk corn for\nthe neighbours until Christmas, as she had done the year before; but\ngrandmother saved her from this by getting her a place to work with our\nneighbours, the Harlings.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nGRANDMOTHER OFTEN SAID THAT if she had to live in town, she thanked\nGod she lived next the Harlings. They had been farming people, like\nourselves, and their place was like a little farm, with a big barn and\na garden, and an orchard and grazing lots--even a windmill. The Harlings\nwere Norwegians, and Mrs. Harling had lived in Christiania until she\nwas ten years old. Her husband was born in Minnesota. He was a grain\nmerchant and cattle-buyer, and was generally considered the most\nenterprising business man in our county. He controlled a line of grain\nelevators in the little towns along the railroad to the west of us, and\nwas away from home a great deal. In his absence his wife was the head of\nthe household.\n\nMrs. Harling was short and square and sturdy-looking, like her house.\nEvery inch of her was charged with an energy that made itself felt the\nmoment she entered a room. Her face was rosy and solid, with bright,\ntwinkling eyes and a stubborn little chin. She was quick to anger, quick\nto laughter, and jolly from the depths of her soul. How well I remember\nher laugh; it had in it the same sudden recognition that flashed into\nher eyes, was a burst of humour, short and intelligent. Her rapid\nfootsteps shook her own floors, and she routed lassitude and\nindifference wherever she came. She could not be negative or perfunctory\nabout anything. Her enthusiasm, and her violent likes and dislikes,\nasserted themselves in all the everyday occupations of life. Wash-day\nwas interesting, never dreary, at the Harlings’. Preserving-time was a\nprolonged festival, and house-cleaning was like a revolution. When\nMrs. Harling made garden that spring, we could feel the stir of her\nundertaking through the willow hedge that separated our place from hers.\n\nThree of the Harling children were near me in age. Charley, the only\nson--they had lost an older boy--was sixteen; Julia, who was known as\nthe musical one, was fourteen when I was; and Sally, the tomboy with\nshort hair, was a year younger. She was nearly as strong as I, and\nuncannily clever at all boys’ sports. Sally was a wild thing, with\nsunburned yellow hair, bobbed about her ears, and a brown skin, for she\nnever wore a hat. She raced all over town on one roller skate, often\ncheated at ‘keeps,’ but was such a quick shot one couldn’t catch her at\nit.\n\nThe grown-up daughter, Frances, was a very important person in our\nworld. She was her father’s chief clerk, and virtually managed his\nBlack Hawk office during his frequent absences. Because of her unusual\nbusiness ability, he was stern and exacting with her. He paid her a\ngood salary, but she had few holidays and never got away from her\nresponsibilities. Even on Sundays she went to the office to open the\nmail and read the markets. With Charley, who was not interested in\nbusiness, but was already preparing for Annapolis, Mr. Harling was very\nindulgent; bought him guns and tools and electric batteries, and never\nasked what he did with them.\n\nFrances was dark, like her father, and quite as tall. In winter she\nwore a sealskin coat and cap, and she and Mr. Harling used to walk home\ntogether in the evening, talking about grain-cars and cattle, like two\nmen. Sometimes she came over to see grandfather after supper, and her\nvisits flattered him. More than once they put their wits together to\nrescue some unfortunate farmer from the clutches of Wick Cutter, the\nBlack Hawk money-lender. Grandfather said Frances Harling was as good a\njudge of credits as any banker in the county. The two or three men who\nhad tried to take advantage of her in a deal acquired celebrity by their\ndefeat. She knew every farmer for miles about: how much land he had\nunder cultivation, how many cattle he was feeding, what his liabilities\nwere. Her interest in these people was more than a business interest.\nShe carried them all in her mind as if they were characters in a book or\na play.\n\nWhen Frances drove out into the country on business, she would go miles\nout of her way to call on some of the old people, or to see the women\nwho seldom got to town. She was quick at understanding the grandmothers\nwho spoke no English, and the most reticent and distrustful of them\nwould tell her their story without realizing they were doing so. She\nwent to country funerals and weddings in all weathers. A farmer’s\ndaughter who was to be married could count on a wedding present from\nFrances Harling.\n\nIn August the Harlings’ Danish cook had to leave them. Grandmother\nentreated them to try Antonia. She cornered Ambrosch the next time he\ncame to town, and pointed out to him that any connection with Christian\nHarling would strengthen his credit and be of advantage to him. One\nSunday Mrs. Harling took the long ride out to the Shimerdas’ with\nFrances. She said she wanted to see ‘what the girl came from’ and to\nhave a clear understanding with her mother. I was in our yard when they\ncame driving home, just before sunset. They laughed and waved to me\nas they passed, and I could see they were in great good humour. After\nsupper, when grandfather set off to church, grandmother and I took my\nshort cut through the willow hedge and went over to hear about the visit\nto the Shimerdas’.\n\nWe found Mrs. Harling with Charley and Sally on the front porch,\nresting after her hard drive. Julia was in the hammock--she was fond\nof repose--and Frances was at the piano, playing without a light and\ntalking to her mother through the open window.\n\nMrs. Harling laughed when she saw us coming. ‘I expect you left your\ndishes on the table tonight, Mrs. Burden,’ she called. Frances shut the\npiano and came out to join us.\n\nThey had liked Antonia from their first glimpse of her; felt they knew\nexactly what kind of girl she was. As for Mrs. Shimerda, they found her\nvery amusing. Mrs. Harling chuckled whenever she spoke of her. ‘I expect\nI am more at home with that sort of bird than you are, Mrs. Burden.\nThey’re a pair, Ambrosch and that old woman!’\n\nThey had had a long argument with Ambrosch about Antonia’s allowance\nfor clothes and pocket-money. It was his plan that every cent of his\nsister’s wages should be paid over to him each month, and he would\nprovide her with such clothing as he thought necessary. When Mrs.\nHarling told him firmly that she would keep fifty dollars a year for\nAntonia’s own use, he declared they wanted to take his sister to town\nand dress her up and make a fool of her. Mrs. Harling gave us a lively\naccount of Ambrosch’s behaviour throughout the interview; how he kept\njumping up and putting on his cap as if he were through with the whole\nbusiness, and how his mother tweaked his coat-tail and prompted him in\nBohemian. Mrs. Harling finally agreed to pay three dollars a week for\nAntonia’s services--good wages in those days--and to keep her in shoes.\nThere had been hot dispute about the shoes, Mrs. Shimerda finally saying\npersuasively that she would send Mrs. Harling three fat geese every year\nto ‘make even.’ Ambrosch was to bring his sister to town next Saturday.\n\n‘She’ll be awkward and rough at first, like enough,’ grandmother said\nanxiously, ‘but unless she’s been spoiled by the hard life she’s led,\nshe has it in her to be a real helpful girl.’\n\nMrs. Harling laughed her quick, decided laugh. ‘Oh, I’m not worrying,\nMrs. Burden! I can bring something out of that girl. She’s barely\nseventeen, not too old to learn new ways. She’s good-looking, too!’ she\nadded warmly.\n\n\nFrances turned to grandmother. ‘Oh, yes, Mrs. Burden, you didn’t tell\nus that! She was working in the garden when we got there, barefoot and\nragged. But she has such fine brown legs and arms, and splendid colour\nin her cheeks--like those big dark red plums.’\n\nWe were pleased at this praise. Grandmother spoke feelingly. ‘When she\nfirst came to this country, Frances, and had that genteel old man to\nwatch over her, she was as pretty a girl as ever I saw. But, dear me,\nwhat a life she’s led, out in the fields with those rough threshers!\nThings would have been very different with poor Antonia if her father\nhad lived.’\n\nThe Harlings begged us to tell them about Mr. Shimerda’s death and the\nbig snowstorm. By the time we saw grandfather coming home from church,\nwe had told them pretty much all we knew of the Shimerdas.\n\n‘The girl will be happy here, and she’ll forget those things,’ said Mrs.\nHarling confidently, as we rose to take our leave.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nON SATURDAY AMBROSCH drove up to the back gate, and Antonia jumped down\nfrom the wagon and ran into our kitchen just as she used to do. She was\nwearing shoes and stockings, and was breathless and excited. She gave me\na playful shake by the shoulders. ‘You ain’t forget about me, Jim?’\n\nGrandmother kissed her. ‘God bless you, child! Now you’ve come, you must\ntry to do right and be a credit to us.’\n\nAntonia looked eagerly about the house and admired everything. ‘Maybe I\nbe the kind of girl you like better; now I come to town,’ she suggested\nhopefully.\n\nHow good it was to have Antonia near us again; to see her every day and\nalmost every night! Her greatest fault, Mrs. Harling found, was that\nshe so often stopped her work and fell to playing with the children. She\nwould race about the orchard with us, or take sides in our hay-fights\nin the barn, or be the old bear that came down from the mountain and\ncarried off Nina. Tony learned English so quickly that by the time\nschool began she could speak as well as any of us.\n\nI was jealous of Tony’s admiration for Charley Harling. Because he was\nalways first in his classes at school, and could mend the water-pipes\nor the doorbell and take the clock to pieces, she seemed to think him\na sort of prince. Nothing that Charley wanted was too much trouble for\nher. She loved to put up lunches for him when he went hunting, to mend\nhis ball-gloves and sew buttons on his shooting-coat, baked the kind of\nnut-cake he liked, and fed his setter dog when he was away on trips with\nhis father. Antonia had made herself cloth working-slippers out of Mr.\nHarling’s old coats, and in these she went padding about after Charley,\nfairly panting with eagerness to please him.\n\nNext to Charley, I think she loved Nina best. Nina was only six, and she\nwas rather more complex than the other children. She was fanciful,\nhad all sorts of unspoken preferences, and was easily offended. At the\nslightest disappointment or displeasure, her velvety brown eyes filled\nwith tears, and she would lift her chin and walk silently away. If we\nran after her and tried to appease her, it did no good. She walked on\nunmollified. I used to think that no eyes in the world could grow\nso large or hold so many tears as Nina’s. Mrs. Harling and Antonia\ninvariably took her part. We were never given a chance to explain. The\ncharge was simply: ‘You have made Nina cry. Now, Jimmy can go home, and\nSally must get her arithmetic.’ I liked Nina, too; she was so quaint and\nunexpected, and her eyes were lovely; but I often wanted to shake her.\n\nWe had jolly evenings at the Harlings’ when the father was away. If he\nwas at home, the children had to go to bed early, or they came over\nto my house to play. Mr. Harling not only demanded a quiet house, he\ndemanded all his wife’s attention. He used to take her away to their\nroom in the west ell, and talk over his business with her all evening.\nThough we did not realize it then, Mrs. Harling was our audience when we\nplayed, and we always looked to her for suggestions. Nothing flattered\none like her quick laugh.\n\nMr. Harling had a desk in his bedroom, and his own easy-chair by the\nwindow, in which no one else ever sat. On the nights when he was at\nhome, I could see his shadow on the blind, and it seemed to me an\narrogant shadow. Mrs. Harling paid no heed to anyone else if he was\nthere. Before he went to bed she always got him a lunch of smoked salmon\nor anchovies and beer. He kept an alcohol lamp in his room, and a French\ncoffee-pot, and his wife made coffee for him at any hour of the night he\nhappened to want it.\n\nMost Black Hawk fathers had no personal habits outside their domestic\nones; they paid the bills, pushed the baby-carriage after office hours,\nmoved the sprinkler about over the lawn, and took the family driving on\nSunday. Mr. Harling, therefore, seemed to me autocratic and imperial in\nhis ways. He walked, talked, put on his gloves, shook hands, like a man\nwho felt that he had power. He was not tall, but he carried his head so\nhaughtily that he looked a commanding figure, and there was something\ndaring and challenging in his eyes. I used to imagine that the ‘nobles’\nof whom Antonia was always talking probably looked very much like\nChristian Harling, wore caped overcoats like his, and just such a\nglittering diamond upon the little finger.\n\nExcept when the father was at home, the Harling house was never quiet.\nMrs. Harling and Nina and Antonia made as much noise as a houseful of\nchildren, and there was usually somebody at the piano. Julia was the\nonly one who was held down to regular hours of practising, but they\nall played. When Frances came home at noon, she played until dinner was\nready. When Sally got back from school, she sat down in her hat and coat\nand drummed the plantation melodies that Negro minstrel troupes brought\nto town. Even Nina played the Swedish Wedding March.\n\nMrs. Harling had studied the piano under a good teacher, and somehow she\nmanaged to practise every day. I soon learned that if I were sent over\non an errand and found Mrs. Harling at the piano, I must sit down and\nwait quietly until she turned to me. I can see her at this moment: her\nshort, square person planted firmly on the stool, her little fat hands\nmoving quickly and neatly over the keys, her eyes fixed on the music\nwith intelligent concentration.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n     ‘I won’t have none of your weevily wheat,\n      and I won’t have none of your barley,\n     But I’ll take a measure of fine white\n      flour, to make a cake for Charley.’\n\nWE WERE SINGING rhymes to tease Antonia while she was beating up one of\nCharley’s favourite cakes in her big mixing-bowl.\n\nIt was a crisp autumn evening, just cold enough to make one glad to quit\nplaying tag in the yard, and retreat into the kitchen. We had begun to\nroll popcorn balls with syrup when we heard a knock at the back door,\nand Tony dropped her spoon and went to open it.\n\nA plump, fair-skinned girl was standing in the doorway. She looked\ndemure and pretty, and made a graceful picture in her blue cashmere\ndress and little blue hat, with a plaid shawl drawn neatly about her\nshoulders and a clumsy pocket-book in her hand.\n\n‘Hello, Tony. Don’t you know me?’ she asked in a smooth, low voice,\nlooking in at us archly.\n\nAntonia gasped and stepped back.\n\n‘Why, it’s Lena! Of course I didn’t know you, so dressed up!’\n\nLena Lingard laughed, as if this pleased her. I had not recognized her\nfor a moment, either. I had never seen her before with a hat on her\nhead--or with shoes and stockings on her feet, for that matter. And here\nshe was, brushed and smoothed and dressed like a town girl, smiling at\nus with perfect composure.\n\n‘Hello, Jim,’ she said carelessly as she walked into the kitchen and\nlooked about her. ‘I’ve come to town to work, too, Tony.’\n\n‘Have you, now? Well, ain’t that funny!’ Antonia stood ill at ease, and\ndidn’t seem to know just what to do with her visitor.\n\nThe door was open into the dining-room, where Mrs. Harling sat\ncrocheting and Frances was reading. Frances asked Lena to come in and\njoin them.\n\n‘You are Lena Lingard, aren’t you? I’ve been to see your mother, but you\nwere off herding cattle that day. Mama, this is Chris Lingard’s oldest\ngirl.’\n\nMrs. Harling dropped her worsted and examined the visitor with quick,\nkeen eyes. Lena was not at all disconcerted. She sat down in the chair\nFrances pointed out, carefully arranging her pocket-book and grey\ncotton gloves on her lap. We followed with our popcorn, but Antonia hung\nback--said she had to get her cake into the oven.\n\n‘So you have come to town,’ said Mrs. Harling, her eyes still fixed on\nLena. ‘Where are you working?’\n\n‘For Mrs. Thomas, the dressmaker. She is going to teach me to sew. She\nsays I have quite a knack. I’m through with the farm. There ain’t any\nend to the work on a farm, and always so much trouble happens. I’m going\nto be a dressmaker.’\n\n‘Well, there have to be dressmakers. It’s a good trade. But I wouldn’t\nrun down the farm, if I were you,’ said Mrs. Harling rather severely.\n‘How is your mother?’\n\n‘Oh, mother’s never very well; she has too much to do. She’d get away\nfrom the farm, too, if she could. She was willing for me to come. After\nI learn to do sewing, I can make money and help her.’\n\n‘See that you don’t forget to,’ said Mrs. Harling sceptically, as she\ntook up her crocheting again and sent the hook in and out with nimble\nfingers.\n\n\n‘No, ‘m, I won’t,’ said Lena blandly. She took a few grains of the\npopcorn we pressed upon her, eating them discreetly and taking care not\nto get her fingers sticky.\n\nFrances drew her chair up nearer to the visitor. ‘I thought you were\ngoing to be married, Lena,’ she said teasingly. ‘Didn’t I hear that Nick\nSvendsen was rushing you pretty hard?’\n\nLena looked up with her curiously innocent smile. ‘He did go with me\nquite a while. But his father made a fuss about it and said he wouldn’t\ngive Nick any land if he married me, so he’s going to marry Annie\nIverson. I wouldn’t like to be her; Nick’s awful sullen, and he’ll take\nit out on her. He ain’t spoke to his father since he promised.’\n\nFrances laughed. ‘And how do you feel about it?’\n\n‘I don’t want to marry Nick, or any other man,’ Lena murmured. ‘I’ve\nseen a good deal of married life, and I don’t care for it. I want to be\nso I can help my mother and the children at home, and not have to ask\nlief of anybody.’\n\n‘That’s right,’ said Frances. ‘And Mrs. Thomas thinks you can learn\ndressmaking?’\n\n‘Yes, ‘m. I’ve always liked to sew, but I never had much to do with.\nMrs. Thomas makes lovely things for all the town ladies. Did you know\nMrs. Gardener is having a purple velvet made? The velvet came from\nOmaha. My, but it’s lovely!’ Lena sighed softly and stroked her cashmere\nfolds. ‘Tony knows I never did like out-of-door work,’ she added.\n\nMrs. Harling glanced at her. ‘I expect you’ll learn to sew all right,\nLena, if you’ll only keep your head and not go gadding about to dances\nall the time and neglect your work, the way some country girls do.’\n\n‘Yes, ‘m. Tiny Soderball is coming to town, too. She’s going to work\nat the Boys’ Home Hotel. She’ll see lots of strangers,’ Lena added\nwistfully.\n\n\n‘Too many, like enough,’ said Mrs. Harling. ‘I don’t think a hotel is a\ngood place for a girl; though I guess Mrs. Gardener keeps an eye on her\nwaitresses.’\n\nLena’s candid eyes, that always looked a little sleepy under their long\nlashes, kept straying about the cheerful rooms with naive admiration.\nPresently she drew on her cotton gloves. ‘I guess I must be leaving,’\nshe said irresolutely.\n\nFrances told her to come again, whenever she was lonesome or wanted\nadvice about anything. Lena replied that she didn’t believe she would\never get lonesome in Black Hawk.\n\nShe lingered at the kitchen door and begged Antonia to come and see her\noften. ‘I’ve got a room of my own at Mrs. Thomas’s, with a carpet.’\n\nTony shuffled uneasily in her cloth slippers. ‘I’ll come sometime, but\nMrs. Harling don’t like to have me run much,’ she said evasively.\n\n‘You can do what you please when you go out, can’t you?’ Lena asked in\na guarded whisper. ‘Ain’t you crazy about town, Tony? I don’t care\nwhat anybody says, I’m done with the farm!’ She glanced back over her\nshoulder toward the dining-room, where Mrs. Harling sat.\n\nWhen Lena was gone, Frances asked Antonia why she hadn’t been a little\nmore cordial to her.\n\n‘I didn’t know if your mother would like her coming here,’ said Antonia,\nlooking troubled. ‘She was kind of talked about, out there.’\n\n‘Yes, I know. But mother won’t hold it against her if she behaves well\nhere. You needn’t say anything about that to the children. I guess Jim\nhas heard all that gossip?’\n\nWhen I nodded, she pulled my hair and told me I knew too much, anyhow.\nWe were good friends, Frances and I.\n\nI ran home to tell grandmother that Lena Lingard had come to town. We\nwere glad of it, for she had a hard life on the farm.\n\nLena lived in the Norwegian settlement west of Squaw Creek, and she used\nto herd her father’s cattle in the open country between his place and\nthe Shimerdas’. Whenever we rode over in that direction we saw her\nout among her cattle, bareheaded and barefooted, scantily dressed in\ntattered clothing, always knitting as she watched her herd. Before I\nknew Lena, I thought of her as something wild, that always lived on the\nprairie, because I had never seen her under a roof. Her yellow hair was\nburned to a ruddy thatch on her head; but her legs and arms, curiously\nenough, in spite of constant exposure to the sun, kept a miraculous\nwhiteness which somehow made her seem more undressed than other girls\nwho went scantily clad. The first time I stopped to talk to her, I was\nastonished at her soft voice and easy, gentle ways. The girls out there\nusually got rough and mannish after they went to herding. But Lena asked\nJake and me to get off our horses and stay awhile, and behaved exactly\nas if she were in a house and were accustomed to having visitors. She\nwas not embarrassed by her ragged clothes, and treated us as if we were\nold acquaintances. Even then I noticed the unusual colour of her eyes--a\nshade of deep violet--and their soft, confiding expression.\n\nChris Lingard was not a very successful farmer, and he had a large\nfamily. Lena was always knitting stockings for little brothers and\nsisters, and even the Norwegian women, who disapproved of her, admitted\nthat she was a good daughter to her mother. As Tony said, she had been\ntalked about. She was accused of making Ole Benson lose the little sense\nhe had--and that at an age when she should still have been in pinafores.\n\nOle lived in a leaky dugout somewhere at the edge of the settlement. He\nwas fat and lazy and discouraged, and bad luck had become a habit with\nhim. After he had had every other kind of misfortune, his wife, ‘Crazy\nMary,’ tried to set a neighbour’s barn on fire, and was sent to the\nasylum at Lincoln. She was kept there for a few months, then escaped and\nwalked all the way home, nearly two hundred miles, travelling by night\nand hiding in barns and haystacks by day. When she got back to the\nNorwegian settlement, her poor feet were as hard as hoofs. She promised\nto be good, and was allowed to stay at home--though everyone realized\nshe was as crazy as ever, and she still ran about barefooted through the\nsnow, telling her domestic troubles to her neighbours.\n\nNot long after Mary came back from the asylum, I heard a young Dane, who\nwas helping us to thresh, tell Jake and Otto that Chris Lingard’s oldest\ngirl had put Ole Benson out of his head, until he had no more sense than\nhis crazy wife. When Ole was cultivating his corn that summer, he used\nto get discouraged in the field, tie up his team, and wander off to\nwherever Lena Lingard was herding. There he would sit down on the\ndrawside and help her watch her cattle. All the settlement was talking\nabout it. The Norwegian preacher’s wife went to Lena and told her she\nought not to allow this; she begged Lena to come to church on Sundays.\nLena said she hadn’t a dress in the world any less ragged than the one\non her back. Then the minister’s wife went through her old trunks and\nfound some things she had worn before her marriage.\n\nThe next Sunday Lena appeared at church, a little late, with her hair\ndone up neatly on her head, like a young woman, wearing shoes and\nstockings, and the new dress, which she had made over for herself\nvery becomingly. The congregation stared at her. Until that morning no\none--unless it were Ole--had realized how pretty she was, or that she\nwas growing up. The swelling lines of her figure had been hidden under\nthe shapeless rags she wore in the fields. After the last hymn had\nbeen sung, and the congregation was dismissed, Ole slipped out to the\nhitch-bar and lifted Lena on her horse. That, in itself, was shocking;\na married man was not expected to do such things. But it was nothing to\nthe scene that followed. Crazy Mary darted out from the group of women\nat the church door, and ran down the road after Lena, shouting horrible\nthreats.\n\n‘Look out, you Lena Lingard, look out! I’ll come over with a corn-knife\none day and trim some of that shape off you. Then you won’t sail round\nso fine, making eyes at the men!...’\n\nThe Norwegian women didn’t know where to look. They were formal\nhousewives, most of them, with a severe sense of decorum. But Lena\nLingard only laughed her lazy, good-natured laugh and rode on, gazing\nback over her shoulder at Ole’s infuriated wife.\n\nThe time came, however, when Lena didn’t laugh. More than once Crazy\nMary chased her across the prairie and round and round the Shimerdas’\ncornfield. Lena never told her father; perhaps she was ashamed; perhaps\nshe was more afraid of his anger than of the corn-knife. I was at the\nShimerdas’ one afternoon when Lena came bounding through the red grass\nas fast as her white legs could carry her. She ran straight into the\nhouse and hid in Antonia’s feather-bed. Mary was not far behind: she\ncame right up to the door and made us feel how sharp her blade was,\nshowing us very graphically just what she meant to do to Lena. Mrs.\nShimerda, leaning out of the window, enjoyed the situation keenly,\nand was sorry when Antonia sent Mary away, mollified by an apronful of\nbottle-tomatoes. Lena came out from Tony’s room behind the kitchen,\nvery pink from the heat of the feathers, but otherwise calm. She begged\nAntonia and me to go with her, and help get her cattle together; they\nwere scattered and might be gorging themselves in somebody’s cornfield.\n\n‘Maybe you lose a steer and learn not to make somethings with your eyes\nat married men,’ Mrs. Shimerda told her hectoringly.\n\nLena only smiled her sleepy smile. ‘I never made anything to him with my\neyes. I can’t help it if he hangs around, and I can’t order him off. It\nain’t my prairie.’\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nAFTER LENA CAME To Black Hawk, I often met her downtown, where she\nwould be matching sewing silk or buying ‘findings’ for Mrs. Thomas. If\nI happened to walk home with her, she told me all about the dresses she\nwas helping to make, or about what she saw and heard when she was with\nTiny Soderball at the hotel on Saturday nights.\n\nThe Boys’ Home was the best hotel on our branch of the Burlington, and\nall the commercial travellers in that territory tried to get into Black\nHawk for Sunday. They used to assemble in the parlour after supper on\nSaturday nights. Marshall Field’s man, Anson Kirkpatrick, played the\npiano and sang all the latest sentimental songs. After Tiny had helped\nthe cook wash the dishes, she and Lena sat on the other side of the\ndouble doors between the parlour and the dining-room, listening to the\nmusic and giggling at the jokes and stories. Lena often said she hoped\nI would be a travelling man when I grew up. They had a gay life of it;\nnothing to do but ride about on trains all day and go to theatres\nwhen they were in big cities. Behind the hotel there was an old store\nbuilding, where the salesmen opened their big trunks and spread out\ntheir samples on the counters. The Black Hawk merchants went to look at\nthese things and order goods, and Mrs. Thomas, though she was ‘retail\ntrade,’ was permitted to see them and to ‘get ideas.’ They were all\ngenerous, these travelling men; they gave Tiny Soderball handkerchiefs\nand gloves and ribbons and striped stockings, and so many bottles of\nperfume and cakes of scented soap that she bestowed some of them on\nLena.\n\nOne afternoon in the week before Christmas, I came upon Lena and\nher funny, square-headed little brother Chris, standing before the\ndrugstore, gazing in at the wax dolls and blocks and Noah’s Arks\narranged in the frosty show window. The boy had come to town with a\nneighbour to do his Christmas shopping, for he had money of his own this\nyear. He was only twelve, but that winter he had got the job of sweeping\nout the Norwegian church and making the fire in it every Sunday morning.\nA cold job it must have been, too!\n\nWe went into Duckford’s dry-goods store, and Chris unwrapped all his\npresents and showed them to me -- something for each of the six younger\nthan himself, even a rubber pig for the baby. Lena had given him one of\nTiny Soderball’s bottles of perfume for his mother, and he thought he\nwould get some handkerchiefs to go with it. They were cheap, and he\nhadn’t much money left. We found a tableful of handkerchiefs spread out\nfor view at Duckford’s. Chris wanted those with initial letters in the\ncorner, because he had never seen any before. He studied them seriously,\nwhile Lena looked over his shoulder, telling him she thought the red\nletters would hold their colour best. He seemed so perplexed that I\nthought perhaps he hadn’t enough money, after all. Presently he said\ngravely:\n\n‘Sister, you know mother’s name is Berthe. I don’t know if I ought to\nget B for Berthe, or M for Mother.’\n\nLena patted his bristly head. ‘I’d get the B, Chrissy. It will please\nher for you to think about her name. Nobody ever calls her by it now.’\n\nThat satisfied him. His face cleared at once, and he took three reds\nand three blues. When the neighbour came in to say that it was time to\nstart, Lena wound Chris’s comforter about his neck and turned up his\njacket collar--he had no overcoat--and we watched him climb into the\nwagon and start on his long, cold drive. As we walked together up the\nwindy street, Lena wiped her eyes with the back of her woollen glove. ‘I\nget awful homesick for them, all the same,’ she murmured, as if she were\nanswering some remembered reproach.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nWINTER COMES DOWN SAVAGELY over a little town on the prairie. The wind\nthat sweeps in from the open country strips away all the leafy screens\nthat hide one yard from another in summer, and the houses seem to draw\ncloser together. The roofs, that looked so far away across the green\ntree-tops, now stare you in the face, and they are so much uglier than\nwhen their angles were softened by vines and shrubs.\n\nIn the morning, when I was fighting my way to school against the wind,\nI couldn’t see anything but the road in front of me; but in the late\nafternoon, when I was coming home, the town looked bleak and desolate to\nme. The pale, cold light of the winter sunset did not beautify--it was\nlike the light of truth itself. When the smoky clouds hung low in the\nwest and the red sun went down behind them, leaving a pink flush on the\nsnowy roofs and the blue drifts, then the wind sprang up afresh, with a\nkind of bitter song, as if it said: ‘This is reality, whether you like\nit or not. All those frivolities of summer, the light and shadow, the\nliving mask of green that trembled over everything, they were lies, and\nthis is what was underneath. This is the truth.’ It was as if we were\nbeing punished for loving the loveliness of summer.\n\nIf I loitered on the playground after school, or went to the post-office\nfor the mail and lingered to hear the gossip about the cigar-stand, it\nwould be growing dark by the time I came home. The sun was gone; the\nfrozen streets stretched long and blue before me; the lights were\nshining pale in kitchen windows, and I could smell the suppers cooking\nas I passed. Few people were abroad, and each one of them was hurrying\ntoward a fire. The glowing stoves in the houses were like magnets. When\none passed an old man, one could see nothing of his face but a red nose\nsticking out between a frosted beard and a long plush cap. The young men\ncapered along with their hands in their pockets, and sometimes tried\na slide on the icy sidewalk. The children, in their bright hoods and\ncomforters, never walked, but always ran from the moment they left their\ndoor, beating their mittens against their sides. When I got as far as\nthe Methodist Church, I was about halfway home. I can remember how glad\nI was when there happened to be a light in the church, and the painted\nglass window shone out at us as we came along the frozen street. In\nthe winter bleakness a hunger for colour came over people, like the\nLaplander’s craving for fats and sugar. Without knowing why, we used to\nlinger on the sidewalk outside the church when the lamps were lighted\nearly for choir practice or prayer-meeting, shivering and talking until\nour feet were like lumps of ice. The crude reds and greens and blues of\nthat coloured glass held us there.\n\nOn winter nights, the lights in the Harlings’ windows drew me like the\npainted glass. Inside that warm, roomy house there was colour, too.\nAfter supper I used to catch up my cap, stick my hands in my pockets,\nand dive through the willow hedge as if witches were after me. Of\ncourse, if Mr. Harling was at home, if his shadow stood out on the blind\nof the west room, I did not go in, but turned and walked home by the\nlong way, through the street, wondering what book I should read as I sat\ndown with the two old people.\n\nSuch disappointments only gave greater zest to the nights when we acted\ncharades, or had a costume ball in the back parlour, with Sally always\ndressed like a boy. Frances taught us to dance that winter, and she\nsaid, from the first lesson, that Antonia would make the best dancer\namong us. On Saturday nights, Mrs. Harling used to play the old operas\nfor us--‘Martha,’ ‘Norma,’ ‘Rigoletto’--telling us the story while she\nplayed. Every Saturday night was like a party. The parlour, the back\nparlour, and the dining-room were warm and brightly lighted, with\ncomfortable chairs and sofas, and gay pictures on the walls. One always\nfelt at ease there. Antonia brought her sewing and sat with us--she was\nalready beginning to make pretty clothes for herself. After the long\nwinter evenings on the prairie, with Ambrosch’s sullen silences and\nher mother’s complaints, the Harlings’ house seemed, as she said, ‘like\nHeaven’ to her. She was never too tired to make taffy or chocolate\ncookies for us. If Sally whispered in her ear, or Charley gave her three\nwinks, Tony would rush into the kitchen and build a fire in the range on\nwhich she had already cooked three meals that day.\n\nWhile we sat in the kitchen waiting for the cookies to bake or the taffy\nto cool, Nina used to coax Antonia to tell her stories--about the calf\nthat broke its leg, or how Yulka saved her little turkeys from drowning\nin the freshet, or about old Christmases and weddings in Bohemia. Nina\ninterpreted the stories about the creche fancifully, and in spite of our\nderision she cherished a belief that Christ was born in Bohemia a\nshort time before the Shimerdas left that country. We all liked Tony’s\nstories. Her voice had a peculiarly engaging quality; it was deep,\na little husky, and one always heard the breath vibrating behind it.\nEverything she said seemed to come right out of her heart.\n\nOne evening when we were picking out kernels for walnut taffy, Tony told\nus a new story.\n\n‘Mrs. Harling, did you ever hear about what happened up in the\nNorwegian settlement last summer, when I was threshing there? We were at\nIversons’, and I was driving one of the grain-wagons.’\n\nMrs. Harling came out and sat down among us. ‘Could you throw the wheat\ninto the bin yourself, Tony?’ She knew what heavy work it was.\n\n‘Yes, ma’m, I did. I could shovel just as fast as that fat Andern boy\nthat drove the other wagon. One day it was just awful hot. When we got\nback to the field from dinner, we took things kind of easy. The men put\nin the horses and got the machine going, and Ole Iverson was up on the\ndeck, cutting bands. I was sitting against a straw-stack, trying to get\nsome shade. My wagon wasn’t going out first, and somehow I felt the heat\nawful that day. The sun was so hot like it was going to burn the world\nup. After a while I see a man coming across the stubble, and when he\ngot close I see it was a tramp. His toes stuck out of his shoes, and\nhe hadn’t shaved for a long while, and his eyes was awful red and wild,\nlike he had some sickness. He comes right up and begins to talk like he\nknows me already. He says: ‘The ponds in this country is done got so low\na man couldn’t drownd himself in one of ‘em.’\n\n‘I told him nobody wanted to drownd themselves, but if we didn’t have\nrain soon we’d have to pump water for the cattle.\n\n‘“Oh, cattle,” he says, “you’ll all take care of your cattle! Ain’t you\ngot no beer here?” I told him he’d have to go to the Bohemians for beer;\nthe Norwegians didn’t have none when they threshed. “My God!” he says,\n“so it’s Norwegians now, is it? I thought this was Americy.”\n\n‘Then he goes up to the machine and yells out to Ole Iverson, “Hello,\npartner, let me up there. I can cut bands, and I’m tired of trampin’. I\nwon’t go no farther.”\n\n‘I tried to make signs to Ole, ‘cause I thought that man was crazy and\nmight get the machine stopped up. But Ole, he was glad to get down out\nof the sun and chaff--it gets down your neck and sticks to you something\nawful when it’s hot like that. So Ole jumped down and crawled under one\nof the wagons for shade, and the tramp got on the machine. He cut bands\nall right for a few minutes, and then, Mrs. Harling, he waved his hand\nto me and jumped head-first right into the threshing machine after the\nwheat.\n\n‘I begun to scream, and the men run to stop the horses, but the belt had\nsucked him down, and by the time they got her stopped, he was all beat\nand cut to pieces. He was wedged in so tight it was a hard job to get\nhim out, and the machine ain’t never worked right since.’\n\n‘Was he clear dead, Tony?’ we cried.\n\n‘Was he dead? Well, I guess so! There, now, Nina’s all upset. We won’t\ntalk about it. Don’t you cry, Nina. No old tramp won’t get you while\nTony’s here.’\n\nMrs. Harling spoke up sternly. ‘Stop crying, Nina, or I’ll always send\nyou upstairs when Antonia tells us about the country. Did they never\nfind out where he came from, Antonia?’\n\n‘Never, ma’m. He hadn’t been seen nowhere except in a little town they\ncall Conway. He tried to get beer there, but there wasn’t any saloon.\nMaybe he came in on a freight, but the brakeman hadn’t seen him. They\ncouldn’t find no letters nor nothing on him; nothing but an old penknife\nin his pocket and the wishbone of a chicken wrapped up in a piece of\npaper, and some poetry.’\n\n‘Some poetry?’ we exclaimed.\n\n‘I remember,’ said Frances. ‘It was “The Old Oaken Bucket,” cut out of\na newspaper and nearly worn out. Ole Iverson brought it into the office\nand showed it to me.’\n\n‘Now, wasn’t that strange, Miss Frances?’ Tony asked thoughtfully. ‘What\nwould anybody want to kill themselves in summer for? In threshing time,\ntoo! It’s nice everywhere then.’\n\n‘So it is, Antonia,’ said Mrs. Harling heartily. ‘Maybe I’ll go home and\nhelp you thresh next summer. Isn’t that taffy nearly ready to eat? I’ve\nbeen smelling it a long while.’\n\nThere was a basic harmony between Antonia and her mistress. They had\nstrong, independent natures, both of them. They knew what they liked,\nand were not always trying to imitate other people. They loved children\nand animals and music, and rough play and digging in the earth. They\nliked to prepare rich, hearty food and to see people eat it; to make\nup soft white beds and to see youngsters asleep in them. They ridiculed\nconceited people and were quick to help unfortunate ones. Deep down in\neach of them there was a kind of hearty joviality, a relish of life, not\nover-delicate, but very invigorating. I never tried to define it, but I\nwas distinctly conscious of it. I could not imagine Antonia’s living for\na week in any other house in Black Hawk than the Harlings’.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nWINTER LIES TOO LONG in country towns; hangs on until it is stale and\nshabby, old and sullen. On the farm the weather was the great fact, and\nmen’s affairs went on underneath it, as the streams creep under the ice.\nBut in Black Hawk the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and\npinched, frozen down to the bare stalk.\n\nThrough January and February I went to the river with the Harlings on\nclear nights, and we skated up to the big island and made bonfires on\nthe frozen sand. But by March the ice was rough and choppy, and the\nsnow on the river bluffs was grey and mournful-looking. I was tired of\nschool, tired of winter clothes, of the rutted streets, of the dirty\ndrifts and the piles of cinders that had lain in the yards so long.\nThere was only one break in the dreary monotony of that month: when\nBlind d’Arnault, the Negro pianist, came to town. He gave a concert at\nthe Opera House on Monday night, and he and his manager spent Saturday\nand Sunday at our comfortable hotel. Mrs. Harling had known d’Arnault\nfor years. She told Antonia she had better go to see Tiny that Saturday\nevening, as there would certainly be music at the Boys’ Home.\n\nSaturday night after supper I ran downtown to the hotel and slipped\nquietly into the parlour. The chairs and sofas were already occupied,\nand the air smelled pleasantly of cigar smoke. The parlour had once been\ntwo rooms, and the floor was swaybacked where the partition had been cut\naway. The wind from without made waves in the long carpet. A coal stove\nglowed at either end of the room, and the grand piano in the middle\nstood open.\n\nThere was an atmosphere of unusual freedom about the house that night,\nfor Mrs. Gardener had gone to Omaha for a week. Johnnie had been having\ndrinks with the guests until he was rather absent-minded. It was Mrs.\nGardener who ran the business and looked after everything. Her husband\nstood at the desk and welcomed incoming travellers. He was a popular\nfellow, but no manager.\n\nMrs. Gardener was admittedly the best-dressed woman in Black Hawk, drove\nthe best horse, and had a smart trap and a little white-and-gold sleigh.\nShe seemed indifferent to her possessions, was not half so solicitous\nabout them as her friends were. She was tall, dark, severe, with\nsomething Indian-like in the rigid immobility of her face. Her manner\nwas cold, and she talked little. Guests felt that they were receiving,\nnot conferring, a favour when they stayed at her house. Even the\nsmartest travelling men were flattered when Mrs. Gardener stopped to\nchat with them for a moment. The patrons of the hotel were divided into\ntwo classes: those who had seen Mrs. Gardener’s diamonds, and those who\nhad not.\n\nWhen I stole into the parlour, Anson Kirkpatrick, Marshall Field’s man,\nwas at the piano, playing airs from a musical comedy then running in\nChicago. He was a dapper little Irishman, very vain, homely as a monkey,\nwith friends everywhere, and a sweetheart in every port, like a sailor.\nI did not know all the men who were sitting about, but I recognized a\nfurniture salesman from Kansas City, a drug man, and Willy O’Reilly, who\ntravelled for a jewellery house and sold musical instruments. The talk\nwas all about good and bad hotels, actors and actresses and musical\nprodigies. I learned that Mrs. Gardener had gone to Omaha to hear Booth\nand Barrett, who were to play there next week, and that Mary Anderson\nwas having a great success in ‘A Winter’s Tale,’ in London.\n\nThe door from the office opened, and Johnnie Gardener came in, directing\nBlind d’Arnault--he would never consent to be led. He was a heavy, bulky\nmulatto, on short legs, and he came tapping the floor in front of him\nwith his gold-headed cane. His yellow face was lifted in the light, with\na show of white teeth, all grinning, and his shrunken, papery eyelids\nlay motionless over his blind eyes.\n\n‘Good evening, gentlemen. No ladies here? Good evening, gentlemen. We\ngoing to have a little music? Some of you gentlemen going to play for\nme this evening?’ It was the soft, amiable Negro voice, like those I\nremembered from early childhood, with the note of docile subservience\nin it. He had the Negro head, too; almost no head at all; nothing behind\nthe ears but folds of neck under close-clipped wool. He would have\nbeen repulsive if his face had not been so kindly and happy. It was the\nhappiest face I had seen since I left Virginia.\n\nHe felt his way directly to the piano. The moment he sat down, I noticed\nthe nervous infirmity of which Mrs. Harling had told me. When he was\nsitting, or standing still, he swayed back and forth incessantly, like\na rocking toy. At the piano, he swayed in time to the music, and when\nhe was not playing, his body kept up this motion, like an empty mill\ngrinding on. He found the pedals and tried them, ran his yellow hands up\nand down the keys a few times, tinkling off scales, then turned to the\ncompany.\n\n‘She seems all right, gentlemen. Nothing happened to her since the\nlast time I was here. Mrs. Gardener, she always has this piano tuned\nup before I come. Now gentlemen, I expect you’ve all got grand voices.\nSeems like we might have some good old plantation songs tonight.’\n\nThe men gathered round him, as he began to play ‘My Old Kentucky Home.’\nThey sang one Negro melody after another, while the mulatto sat rocking\nhimself, his head thrown back, his yellow face lifted, his shrivelled\neyelids never fluttering.\n\nHe was born in the Far South, on the d’Arnault plantation, where the\nspirit if not the fact of slavery persisted. When he was three weeks\nold, he had an illness which left him totally blind. As soon as he was\nold enough to sit up alone and toddle about, another affliction, the\nnervous motion of his body, became apparent. His mother, a buxom young\nNegro wench who was laundress for the d’Arnaults, concluded that her\nblind baby was ‘not right’ in his head, and she was ashamed of him. She\nloved him devotedly, but he was so ugly, with his sunken eyes and his\n‘fidgets,’ that she hid him away from people. All the dainties she\nbrought down from the Big House were for the blind child, and she beat\nand cuffed her other children whenever she found them teasing him or\ntrying to get his chicken-bone away from him. He began to talk early,\nremembered everything he heard, and his mammy said he ‘wasn’t all\nwrong.’ She named him Samson, because he was blind, but on the\nplantation he was known as ‘yellow Martha’s simple child.’ He was docile\nand obedient, but when he was six years old he began to run away from\nhome, always taking the same direction. He felt his way through the\nlilacs, along the boxwood hedge, up to the south wing of the Big House,\nwhere Miss Nellie d’Arnault practised the piano every morning. This\nangered his mother more than anything else he could have done; she was\nso ashamed of his ugliness that she couldn’t bear to have white folks\nsee him. Whenever she caught him slipping away from the cabin, she\nwhipped him unmercifully, and told him what dreadful things old Mr.\nd’Arnault would do to him if he ever found him near the Big House. But\nthe next time Samson had a chance, he ran away again. If Miss d’Arnault\nstopped practising for a moment and went toward the window, she saw this\nhideous little pickaninny, dressed in an old piece of sacking,\nstanding in the open space between the hollyhock rows, his body\nrocking automatically, his blind face lifted to the sun and wearing an\nexpression of idiotic rapture. Often she was tempted to tell Martha that\nthe child must be kept at home, but somehow the memory of his foolish,\nhappy face deterred her. She remembered that his sense of hearing was\nnearly all he had--though it did not occur to her that he might have\nmore of it than other children.\n\nOne day Samson was standing thus while Miss Nellie was playing her\nlesson to her music-teacher. The windows were open. He heard them get up\nfrom the piano, talk a little while, and then leave the room. He heard\nthe door close after them. He crept up to the front windows and stuck\nhis head in: there was no one there. He could always detect the presence\nof anyone in a room. He put one foot over the window-sill and straddled\nit.\n\nHis mother had told him over and over how his master would give him to\nthe big mastiff if he ever found him ‘meddling.’ Samson had got too near\nthe mastiff’s kennel once, and had felt his terrible breath in his face.\nHe thought about that, but he pulled in his other foot.\n\nThrough the dark he found his way to the Thing, to its mouth. He touched\nit softly, and it answered softly, kindly. He shivered and stood\nstill. Then he began to feel it all over, ran his finger-tips along the\nslippery sides, embraced the carved legs, tried to get some conception\nof its shape and size, of the space it occupied in primeval night. It\nwas cold and hard, and like nothing else in his black universe. He went\nback to its mouth, began at one end of the keyboard and felt his way\ndown into the mellow thunder, as far as he could go. He seemed to know\nthat it must be done with the fingers, not with the fists or the feet.\nHe approached this highly artificial instrument through a mere instinct,\nand coupled himself to it, as if he knew it was to piece him out and\nmake a whole creature of him. After he had tried over all the sounds,\nhe began to finger out passages from things Miss Nellie had been\npractising, passages that were already his, that lay under the bone of\nhis pinched, conical little skull, definite as animal desires.\n\nThe door opened; Miss Nellie and her music-master stood behind it, but\nblind Samson, who was so sensitive to presences, did not know they were\nthere. He was feeling out the pattern that lay all ready-made on the\nbig and little keys. When he paused for a moment, because the sound was\nwrong and he wanted another, Miss Nellie spoke softly. He whirled about\nin a spasm of terror, leaped forward in the dark, struck his head on the\nopen window, and fell screaming and bleeding to the floor. He had what\nhis mother called a fit. The doctor came and gave him opium.\n\nWhen Samson was well again, his young mistress led him back to the\npiano. Several teachers experimented with him. They found he had\nabsolute pitch, and a remarkable memory. As a very young child he could\nrepeat, after a fashion, any composition that was played for him. No\nmatter how many wrong notes he struck, he never lost the intention of\na passage, he brought the substance of it across by irregular and\nastonishing means. He wore his teachers out. He could never learn like\nother people, never acquired any finish. He was always a Negro prodigy\nwho played barbarously and wonderfully. As piano-playing, it was perhaps\nabominable, but as music it was something real, vitalized by a sense of\nrhythm that was stronger than his other physical senses--that not only\nfilled his dark mind, but worried his body incessantly. To hear him, to\nwatch him, was to see a Negro enjoying himself as only a Negro can. It\nwas as if all the agreeable sensations possible to creatures of flesh\nand blood were heaped up on those black-and-white keys, and he were\ngloating over them and trickling them through his yellow fingers.\n\nIn the middle of a crashing waltz, d’Arnault suddenly began to play\nsoftly, and, turning to one of the men who stood behind him, whispered,\n‘Somebody dancing in there.’ He jerked his bullet-head toward the\ndining-room. ‘I hear little feet--girls, I spect.’\n\nAnson Kirkpatrick mounted a chair and peeped over the transom. Springing\ndown, he wrenched open the doors and ran out into the dining-room. Tiny\nand Lena, Antonia and Mary Dusak, were waltzing in the middle of the\nfloor. They separated and fled toward the kitchen, giggling.\n\nKirkpatrick caught Tiny by the elbows. ‘What’s the matter with you\ngirls? Dancing out here by yourselves, when there’s a roomful of\nlonesome men on the other side of the partition! Introduce me to your\nfriends, Tiny.’\n\nThe girls, still laughing, were trying to escape. Tiny looked alarmed.\n‘Mrs. Gardener wouldn’t like it,’ she protested. ‘She’d be awful mad if\nyou was to come out here and dance with us.’\n\n‘Mrs. Gardener’s in Omaha, girl. Now, you’re Lena, are you?--and you’re\nTony and you’re Mary. Have I got you all straight?’\n\nO’Reilly and the others began to pile the chairs on the tables. Johnnie\nGardener ran in from the office.\n\n‘Easy, boys, easy!’ he entreated them. ‘You’ll wake the cook, and\nthere’ll be the devil to pay for me. She won’t hear the music, but\nshe’ll be down the minute anything’s moved in the dining-room.’\n\n‘Oh, what do you care, Johnnie? Fire the cook and wire Molly to bring\nanother. Come along, nobody’ll tell tales.’\n\nJohnnie shook his head. ‘’S a fact, boys,’ he said confidentially. ‘If I\ntake a drink in Black Hawk, Molly knows it in Omaha!’\n\nHis guests laughed and slapped him on the shoulder. ‘Oh, we’ll make it\nall right with Molly. Get your back up, Johnnie.’\n\nMolly was Mrs. Gardener’s name, of course. ‘Molly Bawn’ was painted\nin large blue letters on the glossy white sides of the hotel bus,\nand ‘Molly’ was engraved inside Johnnie’s ring and on his\nwatch-case--doubtless on his heart, too. He was an affectionate little\nman, and he thought his wife a wonderful woman; he knew that without her\nhe would hardly be more than a clerk in some other man’s hotel.\n\nAt a word from Kirkpatrick, d’Arnault spread himself out over the piano,\nand began to draw the dance music out of it, while the perspiration\nshone on his short wool and on his uplifted face. He looked like some\nglistening African god of pleasure, full of strong, savage blood.\nWhenever the dancers paused to change partners or to catch breath, he\nwould boom out softly, ‘Who’s that goin’ back on me? One of these city\ngentlemen, I bet! Now, you girls, you ain’t goin’ to let that floor get\ncold?’\n\nAntonia seemed frightened at first, and kept looking questioningly at\nLena and Tiny over Willy O’Reilly’s shoulder. Tiny Soderball was trim\nand slender, with lively little feet and pretty ankles--she wore her\ndresses very short. She was quicker in speech, lighter in movement\nand manner than the other girls. Mary Dusak was broad and brown of\ncountenance, slightly marked by smallpox, but handsome for all that.\nShe had beautiful chestnut hair, coils of it; her forehead was low and\nsmooth, and her commanding dark eyes regarded the world indifferently\nand fearlessly. She looked bold and resourceful and unscrupulous, and\nshe was all of these. They were handsome girls, had the fresh colour\nof their country upbringing, and in their eyes that brilliancy which is\ncalled--by no metaphor, alas!--‘the light of youth.’\n\nD’Arnault played until his manager came and shut the piano. Before he\nleft us, he showed us his gold watch which struck the hours, and a\ntopaz ring, given him by some Russian nobleman who delighted in Negro\nmelodies, and had heard d’Arnault play in New Orleans. At last he tapped\nhis way upstairs, after bowing to everybody, docile and happy. I walked\nhome with Antonia. We were so excited that we dreaded to go to bed.\nWe lingered a long while at the Harlings’ gate, whispering in the cold\nuntil the restlessness was slowly chilled out of us.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nTHE HARLING CHILDREN and I were never happier, never felt more contented\nand secure, than in the weeks of spring which broke that long winter.\nWe were out all day in the thin sunshine, helping Mrs. Harling and Tony\nbreak the ground and plant the garden, dig around the orchard trees, tie\nup vines and clip the hedges. Every morning, before I was up, I could\nhear Tony singing in the garden rows. After the apple and cherry trees\nbroke into bloom, we ran about under them, hunting for the new nests\nthe birds were building, throwing clods at each other, and playing\nhide-and-seek with Nina. Yet the summer which was to change everything\nwas coming nearer every day. When boys and girls are growing up, life\ncan’t stand still, not even in the quietest of country towns; and they\nhave to grow up, whether they will or no. That is what their elders are\nalways forgetting.\n\nIt must have been in June, for Mrs. Harling and Antonia were preserving\ncherries, when I stopped one morning to tell them that a dancing\npavilion had come to town. I had seen two drays hauling the canvas and\npainted poles up from the depot.\n\nThat afternoon three cheerful-looking Italians strolled about Black\nHawk, looking at everything, and with them was a dark, stout woman who\nwore a long gold watch-chain about her neck and carried a black lace\nparasol. They seemed especially interested in children and vacant lots.\nWhen I overtook them and stopped to say a word, I found them affable and\nconfiding. They told me they worked in Kansas City in the winter, and in\nsummer they went out among the farming towns with their tent and taught\ndancing. When business fell off in one place, they moved on to another.\n\nThe dancing pavilion was put up near the Danish laundry, on a vacant\nlot surrounded by tall, arched cottonwood trees. It was very much like\na merry-go-round tent, with open sides and gay flags flying from the\npoles. Before the week was over, all the ambitious mothers were sending\ntheir children to the afternoon dancing class. At three o’clock one\nmet little girls in white dresses and little boys in the round-collared\nshirts of the time, hurrying along the sidewalk on their way to the\ntent. Mrs. Vanni received them at the entrance, always dressed in\nlavender with a great deal of black lace, her important watch-chain\nlying on her bosom. She wore her hair on the top of her head, built up\nin a black tower, with red coral combs. When she smiled, she showed two\nrows of strong, crooked yellow teeth. She taught the little children\nherself, and her husband, the harpist, taught the older ones.\n\nOften the mothers brought their fancywork and sat on the shady side\nof the tent during the lesson. The popcorn man wheeled his glass wagon\nunder the big cottonwood by the door, and lounged in the sun, sure of a\ngood trade when the dancing was over. Mr. Jensen, the Danish laundryman,\nused to bring a chair from his porch and sit out in the grass plot. Some\nragged little boys from the depot sold pop and iced lemonade under a\nwhite umbrella at the corner, and made faces at the spruce youngsters\nwho came to dance. That vacant lot soon became the most cheerful place\nin town. Even on the hottest afternoons the cottonwoods made a rustling\nshade, and the air smelled of popcorn and melted butter, and Bouncing\nBets wilting in the sun. Those hardy flowers had run away from the\nlaundryman’s garden, and the grass in the middle of the lot was pink\nwith them.\n\nThe Vannis kept exemplary order, and closed every evening at the hour\nsuggested by the city council. When Mrs. Vanni gave the signal, and\nthe harp struck up ‘Home, Sweet Home,’ all Black Hawk knew it was ten\no’clock. You could set your watch by that tune as confidently as by the\nroundhouse whistle.\n\nAt last there was something to do in those long, empty summer evenings,\nwhen the married people sat like images on their front porches, and the\nboys and girls tramped and tramped the board sidewalks--northward to\nthe edge of the open prairie, south to the depot, then back again to the\npost-office, the ice-cream parlour, the butcher shop. Now there was a\nplace where the girls could wear their new dresses, and where one could\nlaugh aloud without being reproved by the ensuing silence. That silence\nseemed to ooze out of the ground, to hang under the foliage of the black\nmaple trees with the bats and shadows. Now it was broken by lighthearted\nsounds. First the deep purring of Mr. Vanni’s harp came in silvery\nripples through the blackness of the dusty-smelling night; then the\nviolins fell in--one of them was almost like a flute. They called\nso archly, so seductively, that our feet hurried toward the tent of\nthemselves. Why hadn’t we had a tent before?\n\nDancing became popular now, just as roller skating had been the summer\nbefore. The Progressive Euchre Club arranged with the Vannis for the\nexclusive use of the floor on Tuesday and Friday nights. At other times\nanyone could dance who paid his money and was orderly; the railroad men,\nthe roundhouse mechanics, the delivery boys, the iceman, the farm-hands\nwho lived near enough to ride into town after their day’s work was over.\n\nI never missed a Saturday night dance. The tent was open until midnight\nthen. The country boys came in from farms eight and ten miles away, and\nall the country girls were on the floor--Antonia and Lena and Tiny, and\nthe Danish laundry girls and their friends. I was not the only boy who\nfound these dances gayer than the others. The young men who belonged to\nthe Progressive Euchre Club used to drop in late and risk a tiff with\ntheir sweethearts and general condemnation for a waltz with ‘the hired\ngirls.’\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nTHERE WAS A CURIOUS social situation in Black Hawk. All the young men\nfelt the attraction of the fine, well-set-up country girls who had come\nto town to earn a living, and, in nearly every case, to help the father\nstruggle out of debt, or to make it possible for the younger children of\nthe family to go to school.\n\nThose girls had grown up in the first bitter-hard times, and had got\nlittle schooling themselves. But the younger brothers and sisters, for\nwhom they made such sacrifices and who have had ‘advantages,’ never seem\nto me, when I meet them now, half as interesting or as well educated.\nThe older girls, who helped to break up the wild sod, learned so much\nfrom life, from poverty, from their mothers and grandmothers; they had\nall, like Antonia, been early awakened and made observant by coming at a\ntender age from an old country to a new.\n\nI can remember a score of these country girls who were in service\nin Black Hawk during the few years I lived there, and I can remember\nsomething unusual and engaging about each of them. Physically they were\nalmost a race apart, and out-of-door work had given them a vigour which,\nwhen they got over their first shyness on coming to town, developed into\na positive carriage and freedom of movement, and made them conspicuous\namong Black Hawk women.\n\nThat was before the day of high-school athletics. Girls who had to\nwalk more than half a mile to school were pitied. There was not a\ntennis-court in the town; physical exercise was thought rather inelegant\nfor the daughters of well-to-do families. Some of the high-school girls\nwere jolly and pretty, but they stayed indoors in winter because of\nthe cold, and in summer because of the heat. When one danced with them,\ntheir bodies never moved inside their clothes; their muscles seemed to\nask but one thing--not to be disturbed. I remember those girls merely\nas faces in the schoolroom, gay and rosy, or listless and dull, cut off\nbelow the shoulders, like cherubs, by the ink-smeared tops of the\nhigh desks that were surely put there to make us round-shouldered and\nhollow-chested.\n\nThe daughters of Black Hawk merchants had a confident, unenquiring\nbelief that they were ‘refined,’ and that the country girls, who\n‘worked out,’ were not. The American farmers in our county were quite\nas hard-pressed as their neighbours from other countries. All alike had\ncome to Nebraska with little capital and no knowledge of the soil they\nmust subdue. All had borrowed money on their land. But no matter in what\nstraits the Pennsylvanian or Virginian found himself, he would not\nlet his daughters go out into service. Unless his girls could teach a\ncountry school, they sat at home in poverty.\n\nThe Bohemian and Scandinavian girls could not get positions as teachers,\nbecause they had had no opportunity to learn the language. Determined\nto help in the struggle to clear the homestead from debt, they had no\nalternative but to go into service. Some of them, after they came to\ntown, remained as serious and as discreet in behaviour as they had been\nwhen they ploughed and herded on their father’s farm. Others, like the\nthree Bohemian Marys, tried to make up for the years of youth they had\nlost. But every one of them did what she had set out to do, and sent\nhome those hard-earned dollars. The girls I knew were always helping to\npay for ploughs and reapers, brood-sows, or steers to fatten.\n\nOne result of this family solidarity was that the foreign farmers in our\ncounty were the first to become prosperous. After the fathers were out\nof debt, the daughters married the sons of neighbours--usually of like\nnationality--and the girls who once worked in Black Hawk kitchens are\nto-day managing big farms and fine families of their own; their children\nare better off than the children of the town women they used to serve.\n\nI thought the attitude of the town people toward these girls very\nstupid. If I told my schoolmates that Lena Lingard’s grandfather was a\nclergyman, and much respected in Norway, they looked at me blankly. What\ndid it matter? All foreigners were ignorant people who couldn’t speak\nEnglish. There was not a man in Black Hawk who had the intelligence or\ncultivation, much less the personal distinction, of Antonia’s father.\nYet people saw no difference between her and the three Marys; they were\nall Bohemians, all ‘hired girls.’\n\nI always knew I should live long enough to see my country girls come\ninto their own, and I have. To-day the best that a harassed Black Hawk\nmerchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and\nautomobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian\nand Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses.\n\nThe Black Hawk boys looked forward to marrying Black Hawk girls, and\nliving in a brand-new little house with best chairs that must not be\nsat upon, and hand-painted china that must not be used. But sometimes a\nyoung fellow would look up from his ledger, or out through the grating\nof his father’s bank, and let his eyes follow Lena Lingard, as she\npassed the window with her slow, undulating walk, or Tiny Soderball,\ntripping by in her short skirt and striped stockings.\n\nThe country girls were considered a menace to the social order. Their\nbeauty shone out too boldly against a conventional background. But\nanxious mothers need have felt no alarm. They mistook the mettle of\ntheir sons. The respect for respectability was stronger than any desire\nin Black Hawk youth.\n\nOur young man of position was like the son of a royal house; the boy who\nswept out his office or drove his delivery wagon might frolic with the\njolly country girls, but he himself must sit all evening in a plush\nparlour where conversation dragged so perceptibly that the father often\ncame in and made blundering efforts to warm up the atmosphere. On his\nway home from his dull call, he would perhaps meet Tony and Lena, coming\nalong the sidewalk whispering to each other, or the three Bohemian Marys\nin their long plush coats and caps, comporting themselves with a dignity\nthat only made their eventful histories the more piquant. If he went to\nthe hotel to see a travelling man on business, there was Tiny, arching\nher shoulders at him like a kitten. If he went into the laundry to get\nhis collars, there were the four Danish girls, smiling up from their\nironing-boards, with their white throats and their pink cheeks.\n\nThe three Marys were the heroines of a cycle of scandalous stories,\nwhich the old men were fond of relating as they sat about the\ncigar-stand in the drugstore. Mary Dusak had been housekeeper for a\nbachelor rancher from Boston, and after several years in his service\nshe was forced to retire from the world for a short time. Later she\ncame back to town to take the place of her friend, Mary Svoboda, who was\nsimilarly embarrassed. The three Marys were considered as dangerous as\nhigh explosives to have about the kitchen, yet they were such good cooks\nand such admirable housekeepers that they never had to look for a place.\n\nThe Vannis’ tent brought the town boys and the country girls together on\nneutral ground. Sylvester Lovett, who was cashier in his father’s bank,\nalways found his way to the tent on Saturday night. He took all the\ndances Lena Lingard would give him, and even grew bold enough to walk\nhome with her. If his sisters or their friends happened to be among the\nonlookers on ‘popular nights,’ Sylvester stood back in the shadow\nunder the cottonwood trees, smoking and watching Lena with a harassed\nexpression. Several times I stumbled upon him there in the dark, and I\nfelt rather sorry for him. He reminded me of Ole Benson, who used to\nsit on the drawside and watch Lena herd her cattle. Later in the summer,\nwhen Lena went home for a week to visit her mother, I heard from Antonia\nthat young Lovett drove all the way out there to see her, and took her\nbuggy-riding. In my ingenuousness I hoped that Sylvester would marry\nLena, and thus give all the country girls a better position in the town.\n\nSylvester dallied about Lena until he began to make mistakes in his\nwork; had to stay at the bank until after dark to make his books\nbalance. He was daft about her, and everyone knew it. To escape from his\npredicament he ran away with a widow six years older than himself, who\nowned a half-section. This remedy worked, apparently. He never looked at\nLena again, nor lifted his eyes as he ceremoniously tipped his hat when\nhe happened to meet her on the sidewalk.\n\nSo that was what they were like, I thought, these white-handed,\nhigh-collared clerks and bookkeepers! I used to glare at young Lovett\nfrom a distance and only wished I had some way of showing my contempt\nfor him.\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nIT WAS AT THE Vannis’ tent that Antonia was discovered. Hitherto she\nhad been looked upon more as a ward of the Harlings than as one of the\n‘hired girls.’ She had lived in their house and yard and garden; her\nthoughts never seemed to stray outside that little kingdom. But after\nthe tent came to town she began to go about with Tiny and Lena and their\nfriends. The Vannis often said that Antonia was the best dancer of them\nall. I sometimes heard murmurs in the crowd outside the pavilion that\nMrs. Harling would soon have her hands full with that girl. The young\nmen began to joke with each other about ‘the Harlings’ Tony’ as they did\nabout ‘the Marshalls’ Anna’ or ‘the Gardeners’ Tiny.’\n\nAntonia talked and thought of nothing but the tent. She hummed the\ndance tunes all day. When supper was late, she hurried with her dishes,\ndropped and smashed them in her excitement. At the first call of the\nmusic, she became irresponsible. If she hadn’t time to dress, she merely\nflung off her apron and shot out of the kitchen door. Sometimes I went\nwith her; the moment the lighted tent came into view she would break\ninto a run, like a boy. There were always partners waiting for her; she\nbegan to dance before she got her breath.\n\nAntonia’s success at the tent had its consequences. The iceman\nlingered too long now, when he came into the covered porch to fill the\nrefrigerator. The delivery boys hung about the kitchen when they brought\nthe groceries. Young farmers who were in town for Saturday came tramping\nthrough the yard to the back door to engage dances, or to invite Tony to\nparties and picnics. Lena and Norwegian Anna dropped in to help her with\nher work, so that she could get away early. The boys who brought her\nhome after the dances sometimes laughed at the back gate and wakened Mr.\nHarling from his first sleep. A crisis was inevitable.\n\nOne Saturday night Mr. Harling had gone down to the cellar for beer. As\nhe came up the stairs in the dark, he heard scuffling on the back porch,\nand then the sound of a vigorous slap. He looked out through the side\ndoor in time to see a pair of long legs vaulting over the picket fence.\nAntonia was standing there, angry and excited. Young Harry Paine, who\nwas to marry his employer’s daughter on Monday, had come to the tent\nwith a crowd of friends and danced all evening. Afterward, he begged\nAntonia to let him walk home with her. She said she supposed he was a\nnice young man, as he was one of Miss Frances’s friends, and she\ndidn’t mind. On the back porch he tried to kiss her, and when she\nprotested--because he was going to be married on Monday--he caught her\nand kissed her until she got one hand free and slapped him.\n\nMr. Harling put his beer-bottles down on the table. ‘This is what\nI’ve been expecting, Antonia. You’ve been going with girls who have\na reputation for being free and easy, and now you’ve got the same\nreputation. I won’t have this and that fellow tramping about my back\nyard all the time. This is the end of it, tonight. It stops, short. You\ncan quit going to these dances, or you can hunt another place. Think it\nover.’\n\nThe next morning when Mrs. Harling and Frances tried to reason with\nAntonia, they found her agitated but determined. ‘Stop going to the\ntent?’ she panted. ‘I wouldn’t think of it for a minute! My own father\ncouldn’t make me stop! Mr. Harling ain’t my boss outside my work. I\nwon’t give up my friends, either. The boys I go with are nice fellows.\nI thought Mr. Paine was all right, too, because he used to come here. I\nguess I gave him a red face for his wedding, all right!’ she blazed out\nindignantly.\n\n‘You’ll have to do one thing or the other, Antonia,’ Mrs. Harling told\nher decidedly. ‘I can’t go back on what Mr. Harling has said. This is\nhis house.’\n\n‘Then I’ll just leave, Mrs. Harling. Lena’s been wanting me to get a\nplace closer to her for a long while. Mary Svoboda’s going away from the\nCutters’ to work at the hotel, and I can have her place.’\n\nMrs. Harling rose from her chair. ‘Antonia, if you go to the Cutters’ to\nwork, you cannot come back to this house again. You know what that man\nis. It will be the ruin of you.’\n\nTony snatched up the teakettle and began to pour boiling water over the\nglasses, laughing excitedly. ‘Oh, I can take care of myself! I’m a lot\nstronger than Cutter is. They pay four dollars there, and there’s no\nchildren. The work’s nothing; I can have every evening, and be out a lot\nin the afternoons.’\n\n‘I thought you liked children. Tony, what’s come over you?’\n\n‘I don’t know, something has.’ Antonia tossed her head and set her jaw.\n‘A girl like me has got to take her good times when she can. Maybe there\nwon’t be any tent next year. I guess I want to have my fling, like the\nother girls.’\n\nMrs. Harling gave a short, harsh laugh. ‘If you go to work for the\nCutters, you’re likely to have a fling that you won’t get up from in a\nhurry.’\n\nFrances said, when she told grandmother and me about this scene, that\nevery pan and plate and cup on the shelves trembled when her mother\nwalked out of the kitchen. Mrs. Harling declared bitterly that she\nwished she had never let herself get fond of Antonia.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nWICK CUTTER WAS the money-lender who had fleeced poor Russian Peter.\nWhen a farmer once got into the habit of going to Cutter, it was like\ngambling or the lottery; in an hour of discouragement he went back.\n\nCutter’s first name was Wycliffe, and he liked to talk about his pious\nbringing-up. He contributed regularly to the Protestant churches, ‘for\nsentiment’s sake,’ as he said with a flourish of the hand. He came from\na town in Iowa where there were a great many Swedes, and could speak\na little Swedish, which gave him a great advantage with the early\nScandinavian settlers.\n\nIn every frontier settlement there are men who have come there to escape\nrestraint. Cutter was one of the ‘fast set’ of Black Hawk business men.\nHe was an inveterate gambler, though a poor loser. When we saw a light\nburning in his office late at night, we knew that a game of poker was\ngoing on. Cutter boasted that he never drank anything stronger than\nsherry, and he said he got his start in life by saving the money that\nother young men spent for cigars. He was full of moral maxims for\nboys. When he came to our house on business, he quoted ‘Poor Richard’s\nAlmanack’ to me, and told me he was delighted to find a town boy who\ncould milk a cow. He was particularly affable to grandmother, and\nwhenever they met he would begin at once to talk about ‘the good old\ntimes’ and simple living. I detested his pink, bald head, and his yellow\nwhiskers, always soft and glistening. It was said he brushed them every\nnight, as a woman does her hair. His white teeth looked factory-made.\nHis skin was red and rough, as if from perpetual sunburn; he often went\naway to hot springs to take mud baths. He was notoriously dissolute with\nwomen. Two Swedish girls who had lived in his house were the worse for\nthe experience. One of them he had taken to Omaha and established in the\nbusiness for which he had fitted her. He still visited her.\n\nCutter lived in a state of perpetual warfare with his wife, and yet,\napparently, they never thought of separating. They dwelt in a fussy,\nscroll-work house, painted white and buried in thick evergreens, with\na fussy white fence and barn. Cutter thought he knew a great deal about\nhorses, and usually had a colt which he was training for the track.\nOn Sunday mornings one could see him out at the fair grounds, speeding\naround the race-course in his trotting-buggy, wearing yellow gloves and\na black-and-white-check travelling cap, his whiskers blowing back in the\nbreeze. If there were any boys about, Cutter would offer one of them\na quarter to hold the stop-watch, and then drive off, saying he had no\nchange and would ‘fix it up next time.’ No one could cut his lawn or\nwash his buggy to suit him. He was so fastidious and prim about his\nplace that a boy would go to a good deal of trouble to throw a dead cat\ninto his back yard, or to dump a sackful of tin cans in his alley. It\nwas a peculiar combination of old-maidishness and licentiousness that\nmade Cutter seem so despicable.\n\nHe had certainly met his match when he married Mrs. Cutter. She was a\nterrifying-looking person; almost a giantess in height, raw-boned, with\niron-grey hair, a face always flushed, and prominent, hysterical eyes.\nWhen she meant to be entertaining and agreeable, she nodded her head\nincessantly and snapped her eyes at one. Her teeth were long and curved,\nlike a horse’s; people said babies always cried if she smiled at them.\nHer face had a kind of fascination for me: it was the very colour and\nshape of anger. There was a gleam of something akin to insanity in\nher full, intense eyes. She was formal in manner, and made calls\nin rustling, steel-grey brocades and a tall bonnet with bristling\naigrettes.\n\nMrs. Cutter painted china so assiduously that even her wash-bowls and\npitchers, and her husband’s shaving-mug, were covered with violets and\nlilies. Once, when Cutter was exhibiting some of his wife’s china to a\ncaller, he dropped a piece. Mrs. Cutter put her handkerchief to her lips\nas if she were going to faint and said grandly: ‘Mr. Cutter, you have\nbroken all the Commandments--spare the finger-bowls!’\n\nThey quarrelled from the moment Cutter came into the house until they\nwent to bed at night, and their hired girls reported these scenes to\nthe town at large. Mrs. Cutter had several times cut paragraphs about\nunfaithful husbands out of the newspapers and mailed them to Cutter in\na disguised handwriting. Cutter would come home at noon, find the\nmutilated journal in the paper-rack, and triumphantly fit the clipping\ninto the space from which it had been cut. Those two could quarrel\nall morning about whether he ought to put on his heavy or his light\nunderwear, and all evening about whether he had taken cold or not.\n\nThe Cutters had major as well as minor subjects for dispute. The chief\nof these was the question of inheritance: Mrs. Cutter told her husband\nit was plainly his fault they had no children. He insisted that Mrs.\nCutter had purposely remained childless, with the determination to\noutlive him and to share his property with her ‘people,’ whom he\ndetested. To this she would reply that unless he changed his mode\nof life, she would certainly outlive him. After listening to her\ninsinuations about his physical soundness, Cutter would resume his\ndumb-bell practice for a month, or rise daily at the hour when his wife\nmost liked to sleep, dress noisily, and drive out to the track with his\ntrotting-horse.\n\nOnce when they had quarrelled about household expenses, Mrs. Cutter\nput on her brocade and went among their friends soliciting orders for\npainted china, saying that Mr. Cutter had compelled her ‘to live by her\nbrush.’ Cutter wasn’t shamed as she had expected; he was delighted!\n\nCutter often threatened to chop down the cedar trees which half-buried\nthe house. His wife declared she would leave him if she were stripped\nof the I privacy’ which she felt these trees afforded her. That was his\nopportunity, surely; but he never cut down the trees. The Cutters seemed\nto find their relations to each other interesting and stimulating, and\ncertainly the rest of us found them so. Wick Cutter was different from\nany other rascal I have ever known, but I have found Mrs. Cutters\nall over the world; sometimes founding new religions, sometimes being\nforcibly fed--easily recognizable, even when superficially tamed.\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nAFTER ANTONIA WENT TO live with the Cutters, she seemed to care about\nnothing but picnics and parties and having a good time. When she was\nnot going to a dance, she sewed until midnight. Her new clothes were\nthe subject of caustic comment. Under Lena’s direction she copied\nMrs. Gardener’s new party dress and Mrs. Smith’s street costume so\ningeniously in cheap materials that those ladies were greatly annoyed,\nand Mrs. Cutter, who was jealous of them, was secretly pleased.\n\nTony wore gloves now, and high-heeled shoes and feathered bonnets, and\nshe went downtown nearly every afternoon with Tiny and Lena and the\nMarshalls’ Norwegian Anna. We high-school boys used to linger on the\nplayground at the afternoon recess to watch them as they came tripping\ndown the hill along the board sidewalk, two and two. They were growing\nprettier every day, but as they passed us, I used to think with pride\nthat Antonia, like Snow-White in the fairy tale, was still ‘fairest of\nthem all.’\n\nBeing a senior now, I got away from school early. Sometimes I overtook\nthe girls downtown and coaxed them into the ice-cream parlour, where\nthey would sit chattering and laughing, telling me all the news from the\ncountry.\n\nI remember how angry Tiny Soderball made me one afternoon. She declared\nshe had heard grandmother was going to make a Baptist preacher of me. ‘I\nguess you’ll have to stop dancing and wear a white necktie then. Won’t\nhe look funny, girls?’\n\nLena laughed. ‘You’ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you’re going to be a\npreacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and\nthen baptize the babies.’\n\nNorwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly.\n\n‘Baptists don’t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?’\n\nI told her I didn’t know what they believed, and didn’t care, and that I\ncertainly wasn’t going to be a preacher.\n\n‘That’s too bad,’ Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. ‘You’d make\nsuch a good one. You’re so studious. Maybe you’d like to be a professor.\nYou used to teach Tony, didn’t you?’\n\nAntonia broke in. ‘I’ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You’d be\ngood with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother’s trained you up so nice.\nMy papa always said you were an awful smart boy.’\n\nI said I was going to be whatever I pleased. ‘Won’t you be surprised,\nMiss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?’\n\nThey laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the\nhigh-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to\nbuy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was\na sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who\nshowed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively\nenough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys.\n\n\nThe enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at\nonce die out. After the tent left town, the Euchre Club became the Owl\nClub, and gave dances in the Masonic Hall once a week. I was invited to\njoin, but declined. I was moody and restless that winter, and tired of\nthe people I saw every day. Charley Harling was already at Annapolis,\nwhile I was still sitting in Black Hawk, answering to my name at\nroll-call every morning, rising from my desk at the sound of a bell and\nmarching out like the grammar-school children. Mrs. Harling was a little\ncool toward me, because I continued to champion Antonia. What was there\nfor me to do after supper? Usually I had learned next day’s lessons by\nthe time I left the school building, and I couldn’t sit still and read\nforever.\n\nIn the evening I used to prowl about, hunting for diversion. There lay\nthe familiar streets, frozen with snow or liquid with mud. They led to\nthe houses of good people who were putting the babies to bed, or simply\nsitting still before the parlour stove, digesting their supper. Black\nHawk had two saloons. One of them was admitted, even by the church\npeople, to be as respectable as a saloon could be. Handsome Anton\nJelinek, who had rented his homestead and come to town, was the\nproprietor. In his saloon there were long tables where the Bohemian and\nGerman farmers could eat the lunches they brought from home while they\ndrank their beer. Jelinek kept rye bread on hand and smoked fish and\nstrong imported cheeses to please the foreign palate. I liked to drop\ninto his bar-room and listen to the talk. But one day he overtook me on\nthe street and clapped me on the shoulder.\n\n‘Jim,’ he said, ‘I am good friends with you and I always like to see\nyou. But you know how the church people think about saloons. Your\ngrandpa has always treated me fine, and I don’t like to have you come\ninto my place, because I know he don’t like it, and it puts me in bad\nwith him.’\n\nSo I was shut out of that.\n\nOne could hang about the drugstore; and listen to the old men who sat\nthere every evening, talking politics and telling raw stories. One could\ngo to the cigar factory and chat with the old German who raised canaries\nfor sale, and look at his stuffed birds. But whatever you began with\nhim, the talk went back to taxidermy. There was the depot, of course; I\noften went down to see the night train come in, and afterward sat\nawhile with the disconsolate telegrapher who was always hoping to be\ntransferred to Omaha or Denver, ‘where there was some life.’ He was sure\nto bring out his pictures of actresses and dancers. He got them with\ncigarette coupons, and nearly smoked himself to death to possess these\ndesired forms and faces. For a change, one could talk to the station\nagent; but he was another malcontent; spent all his spare time writing\nletters to officials requesting a transfer. He wanted to get back to\nWyoming where he could go trout-fishing on Sundays. He used to say\n‘there was nothing in life for him but trout streams, ever since he’d\nlost his twins.’\n\nThese were the distractions I had to choose from. There were no other\nlights burning downtown after nine o’clock. On starlight nights I used\nto pace up and down those long, cold streets, scowling at the little,\nsleeping houses on either side, with their storm-windows and covered\nback porches. They were flimsy shelters, most of them poorly built\nof light wood, with spindle porch-posts horribly mutilated by the\nturning-lathe. Yet for all their frailness, how much jealousy and envy\nand unhappiness some of them managed to contain! The life that went on\nin them seemed to me made up of evasions and negations; shifts to save\ncooking, to save washing and cleaning, devices to propitiate the tongue\nof gossip. This guarded mode of existence was like living under a\ntyranny. People’s speech, their voices, their very glances, became\nfurtive and repressed. Every individual taste, every natural appetite,\nwas bridled by caution. The people asleep in those houses, I thought,\ntried to live like the mice in their own kitchens; to make no noise,\nto leave no trace, to slip over the surface of things in the dark.\nThe growing piles of ashes and cinders in the back yards were the only\nevidence that the wasteful, consuming process of life went on at all. On\nTuesday nights the Owl Club danced; then there was a little stir in\nthe streets, and here and there one could see a lighted window until\nmidnight. But the next night all was dark again.\n\nAfter I refused to join ‘the Owls,’ as they were called, I made a bold\nresolve to go to the Saturday night dances at Firemen’s Hall. I knew it\nwould be useless to acquaint my elders with any such plan. Grandfather\ndidn’t approve of dancing, anyway; he would only say that if I wanted to\ndance I could go to the Masonic Hall, among ‘the people we knew.’ It was\njust my point that I saw altogether too much of the people we knew.\n\nMy bedroom was on the ground floor, and as I studied there, I had a\nstove in it. I used to retire to my room early on Saturday night, change\nmy shirt and collar and put on my Sunday coat. I waited until all was\nquiet and the old people were asleep, then raised my window, climbed\nout, and went softly through the yard. The first time I deceived my\ngrandparents I felt rather shabby, perhaps even the second time, but I\nsoon ceased to think about it.\n\nThe dance at the Firemen’s Hall was the one thing I looked forward to\nall the week. There I met the same people I used to see at the Vannis’\ntent. Sometimes there were Bohemians from Wilber, or German boys who\ncame down on the afternoon freight from Bismarck. Tony and Lena and Tiny\nwere always there, and the three Bohemian Marys, and the Danish laundry\ngirls.\n\nThe four Danish girls lived with the laundryman and his wife in their\nhouse behind the laundry, with a big garden where the clothes were hung\nout to dry. The laundryman was a kind, wise old fellow, who paid his\ngirls well, looked out for them, and gave them a good home. He told me\nonce that his own daughter died just as she was getting old enough to\nhelp her mother, and that he had been ‘trying to make up for it ever\nsince.’ On summer afternoons he used to sit for hours on the sidewalk\nin front of his laundry, his newspaper lying on his knee, watching\nhis girls through the big open window while they ironed and talked in\nDanish. The clouds of white dust that blew up the street, the gusts of\nhot wind that withered his vegetable garden, never disturbed his calm.\nHis droll expression seemed to say that he had found the secret of\ncontentment. Morning and evening he drove about in his spring wagon,\ndistributing freshly ironed clothes, and collecting bags of linen that\ncried out for his suds and sunny drying-lines. His girls never looked so\npretty at the dances as they did standing by the ironing-board, or over\nthe tubs, washing the fine pieces, their white arms and throats bare,\ntheir cheeks bright as the brightest wild roses, their gold hair moist\nwith the steam or the heat and curling in little damp spirals about\ntheir ears. They had not learned much English, and were not so ambitious\nas Tony or Lena; but they were kind, simple girls and they were always\nhappy. When one danced with them, one smelled their clean, freshly\nironed clothes that had been put away with rosemary leaves from Mr.\nJensen’s garden.\n\nThere were never girls enough to go round at those dances, but everyone\nwanted a turn with Tony and Lena.\n\nLena moved without exertion, rather indolently, and her hand often\naccented the rhythm softly on her partner’s shoulder. She smiled if one\nspoke to her, but seldom answered. The music seemed to put her into a\nsoft, waking dream, and her violet-coloured eyes looked sleepily and\nconfidingly at one from under her long lashes. When she sighed she\nexhaled a heavy perfume of sachet powder. To dance ‘Home, Sweet Home,’\nwith Lena was like coming in with the tide. She danced every dance like\na waltz, and it was always the same waltz--the waltz of coming home to\nsomething, of inevitable, fated return. After a while one got restless\nunder it, as one does under the heat of a soft, sultry summer day.\n\nWhen you spun out into the floor with Tony, you didn’t return to\nanything. You set out every time upon a new adventure. I liked to\nschottische with her; she had so much spring and variety, and was always\nputting in new steps and slides. She taught me to dance against and\naround the hard-and-fast beat of the music. If, instead of going to the\nend of the railroad, old Mr. Shimerda had stayed in New York and picked\nup a living with his fiddle, how different Antonia’s life might have\nbeen!\n\nAntonia often went to the dances with Larry Donovan, a passenger\nconductor who was a kind of professional ladies’ man, as we said. I\nremember how admiringly all the boys looked at her the night she first\nwore her velveteen dress, made like Mrs. Gardener’s black velvet. She\nwas lovely to see, with her eyes shining, and her lips always a little\nparted when she danced. That constant, dark colour in her cheeks never\nchanged.\n\nOne evening when Donovan was out on his run, Antonia came to the hall\nwith Norwegian Anna and her young man, and that night I took her home.\nWhen we were in the Cutters’ yard, sheltered by the evergreens, I told\nher she must kiss me good night.\n\n‘Why, sure, Jim.’ A moment later she drew her face away and whispered\nindignantly, ‘Why, Jim! You know you ain’t right to kiss me like that.\nI’ll tell your grandmother on you!’\n\n‘Lena Lingard lets me kiss her,’ I retorted, ‘and I’m not half as fond\nof her as I am of you.’\n\n‘Lena does?’ Tony gasped. ‘If she’s up to any of her nonsense with you,\nI’ll scratch her eyes out!’ She took my arm again and we walked out of\nthe gate and up and down the sidewalk. ‘Now, don’t you go and be a fool\nlike some of these town boys. You’re not going to sit around here and\nwhittle store-boxes and tell stories all your life. You are going away\nto school and make something of yourself. I’m just awful proud of you.\nYou won’t go and get mixed up with the Swedes, will you?’\n\n‘I don’t care anything about any of them but you,’ I said. ‘And you’ll\nalways treat me like a kid, suppose.’\n\nShe laughed and threw her arms around me. ‘I expect I will, but you’re a\nkid I’m awful fond of, anyhow! You can like me all you want to, but if\nI see you hanging round with Lena much, I’ll go to your grandmother, as\nsure as your name’s Jim Burden! Lena’s all right, only--well, you know\nyourself she’s soft that way. She can’t help it. It’s natural to her.’\n\nIf she was proud of me, I was so proud of her that I carried my head\nhigh as I emerged from the dark cedars and shut the Cutters’ gate softly\nbehind me. Her warm, sweet face, her kind arms, and the true heart in\nher; she was, oh, she was still my Antonia! I looked with contempt at\nthe dark, silent little houses about me as I walked home, and thought of\nthe stupid young men who were asleep in some of them. I knew where the\nreal women were, though I was only a boy; and I would not be afraid of\nthem, either!\n\n\nI hated to enter the still house when I went home from the dances, and\nit was long before I could get to sleep. Toward morning I used to have\npleasant dreams: sometimes Tony and I were out in the country, sliding\ndown straw-stacks as we used to do; climbing up the yellow mountains\nover and over, and slipping down the smooth sides into soft piles of\nchaff.\n\nOne dream I dreamed a great many times, and it was always the same. I\nwas in a harvest-field full of shocks, and I was lying against one of\nthem. Lena Lingard came across the stubble barefoot, in a short skirt,\nwith a curved reaping-hook in her hand, and she was flushed like the\ndawn, with a kind of luminous rosiness all about her. She sat down\nbeside me, turned to me with a soft sigh and said, ‘Now they are all\ngone, and I can kiss you as much as I like.’\n\nI used to wish I could have this flattering dream about Antonia, but I\nnever did.\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nI NOTICED ONE AFTERNOON that grandmother had been crying. Her feet\nseemed to drag as she moved about the house, and I got up from the table\nwhere I was studying and went to her, asking if she didn’t feel well,\nand if I couldn’t help her with her work.\n\n‘No, thank you, Jim. I’m troubled, but I guess I’m well enough. Getting\na little rusty in the bones, maybe,’ she added bitterly.\n\nI stood hesitating. ‘What are you fretting about, grandmother? Has\ngrandfather lost any money?’\n\n‘No, it ain’t money. I wish it was. But I’ve heard things. You must ‘a’\nknown it would come back to me sometime.’ She dropped into a chair, and,\ncovering her face with her apron, began to cry. ‘Jim,’ she said, ‘I was\nnever one that claimed old folks could bring up their grandchildren. But\nit came about so; there wasn’t any other way for you, it seemed like.’\n\nI put my arms around her. I couldn’t bear to see her cry.\n\n‘What is it, grandmother? Is it the Firemen’s dances?’\n\nShe nodded.\n\n‘I’m sorry I sneaked off like that. But there’s nothing wrong about\nthe dances, and I haven’t done anything wrong. I like all those country\ngirls, and I like to dance with them. That’s all there is to it.’\n\n‘But it ain’t right to deceive us, son, and it brings blame on us.\nPeople say you are growing up to be a bad boy, and that ain’t just to\nus.’\n\n‘I don’t care what they say about me, but if it hurts you, that settles\nit. I won’t go to the Firemen’s Hall again.’\n\nI kept my promise, of course, but I found the spring months dull enough.\nI sat at home with the old people in the evenings now, reading Latin\nthat was not in our high-school course. I had made up my mind to do a\nlot of college requirement work in the summer, and to enter the freshman\nclass at the university without conditions in the fall. I wanted to get\naway as soon as possible.\n\nDisapprobation hurt me, I found--even that of people whom I did not\nadmire. As the spring came on, I grew more and more lonely, and fell\nback on the telegrapher and the cigar-maker and his canaries for\ncompanionship. I remember I took a melancholy pleasure in hanging a\nMay-basket for Nina Harling that spring. I bought the flowers from an\nold German woman who always had more window plants than anyone else, and\nspent an afternoon trimming a little workbasket. When dusk came on, and\nthe new moon hung in the sky, I went quietly to the Harlings’ front door\nwith my offering, rang the bell, and then ran away as was the custom.\nThrough the willow hedge I could hear Nina’s cries of delight, and I\nfelt comforted.\n\nOn those warm, soft spring evenings I often lingered downtown to walk\nhome with Frances, and talked to her about my plans and about the\nreading I was doing. One evening she said she thought Mrs. Harling was\nnot seriously offended with me.\n\n‘Mama is as broad-minded as mothers ever are, I guess. But you know she\nwas hurt about Antonia, and she can’t understand why you like to be with\nTiny and Lena better than with the girls of your own set.’\n\n‘Can you?’ I asked bluntly.\n\nFrances laughed. ‘Yes, I think I can. You knew them in the country, and\nyou like to take sides. In some ways you’re older than boys of your age.\nIt will be all right with mama after you pass your college examinations\nand she sees you’re in earnest.’\n\n‘If you were a boy,’ I persisted, ‘you wouldn’t belong to the Owl Club,\neither. You’d be just like me.’\n\nShe shook her head. ‘I would and I wouldn’t. I expect I know the country\ngirls better than you do. You always put a kind of glamour over them.\nThe trouble with you, Jim, is that you’re romantic. Mama’s going to your\nCommencement. She asked me the other day if I knew what your oration is\nto be about. She wants you to do well.’\n\nI thought my oration very good. It stated with fervour a great many\nthings I had lately discovered. Mrs. Harling came to the Opera House to\nhear the Commencement exercises, and I looked at her most of the time\nwhile I made my speech. Her keen, intelligent eyes never left my face.\nAfterward she came back to the dressing-room where we stood, with\nour diplomas in our hands, walked up to me, and said heartily: ‘You\nsurprised me, Jim. I didn’t believe you could do as well as that. You\ndidn’t get that speech out of books.’ Among my graduation presents there\nwas a silk umbrella from Mrs. Harling, with my name on the handle.\n\nI walked home from the Opera House alone. As I passed the Methodist\nChurch, I saw three white figures ahead of me, pacing up and down under\nthe arching maple trees, where the moonlight filtered through the lush\nJune foliage. They hurried toward me; they were waiting for me--Lena and\nTony and Anna Hansen.\n\n‘Oh, Jim, it was splendid!’ Tony was breathing hard, as she always did\nwhen her feelings outran her language. ‘There ain’t a lawyer in Black\nHawk could make a speech like that. I just stopped your grandpa and\nsaid so to him. He won’t tell you, but he told us he was awful surprised\nhimself, didn’t he, girls?’\n\nLena sidled up to me and said teasingly, ‘What made you so solemn? I\nthought you were scared. I was sure you’d forget.’\n\nAnna spoke wistfully.\n\n‘It must make you very happy, Jim, to have fine thoughts like that\nin your mind all the time, and to have words to put them in. I always\nwanted to go to school, you know.’\n\n‘Oh, I just sat there and wished my papa could hear you! Jim’--Antonia\ntook hold of my coat lapels--‘there was something in your speech that\nmade me think so about my papa!’\n\n‘I thought about your papa when I wrote my speech, Tony,’ I said. ‘I\ndedicated it to him.’\n\nShe threw her arms around me, and her dear face was all wet with tears.\n\nI stood watching their white dresses glimmer smaller and smaller down\nthe sidewalk as they went away. I have had no other success that pulled\nat my heartstrings like that one.\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nTHE DAY AFTER COMMENCEMENT I moved my books and desk upstairs, to an\nempty room where I should be undisturbed, and I fell to studying in\nearnest. I worked off a year’s trigonometry that summer, and began\nVirgil alone. Morning after morning I used to pace up and down my sunny\nlittle room, looking off at the distant river bluffs and the roll of the\nblond pastures between, scanning the ‘Aeneid’ aloud and committing long\npassages to memory. Sometimes in the evening Mrs. Harling called to me\nas I passed her gate, and asked me to come in and let her play for me.\nShe was lonely for Charley, she said, and liked to have a boy about.\nWhenever my grandparents had misgivings, and began to wonder whether I\nwas not too young to go off to college alone, Mrs. Harling took up my\ncause vigorously. Grandfather had such respect for her judgment that I\nknew he would not go against her.\n\n\nI had only one holiday that summer. It was in July. I met Antonia\ndowntown on Saturday afternoon, and learned that she and Tiny and Lena\nwere going to the river next day with Anna Hansen--the elder was all in\nbloom now, and Anna wanted to make elderblow wine.\n\n‘Anna’s to drive us down in the Marshalls’ delivery wagon, and we’ll\ntake a nice lunch and have a picnic. Just us; nobody else. Couldn’t you\nhappen along, Jim? It would be like old times.’\n\nI considered a moment. ‘Maybe I can, if I won’t be in the way.’\n\nOn Sunday morning I rose early and got out of Black Hawk while the dew\nwas still heavy on the long meadow grasses. It was the high season for\nsummer flowers. The pink bee-bush stood tall along the sandy roadsides,\nand the cone-flowers and rose mallow grew everywhere. Across the wire\nfence, in the long grass, I saw a clump of flaming orange-coloured\nmilkweed, rare in that part of the state. I left the road and went\naround through a stretch of pasture that was always cropped short in\nsummer, where the gaillardia came up year after year and matted over\nthe ground with the deep, velvety red that is in Bokhara carpets. The\ncountry was empty and solitary except for the larks that Sunday morning,\nand it seemed to lift itself up to me and to come very close.\n\nThe river was running strong for midsummer; heavy rains to the west of\nus had kept it full. I crossed the bridge and went upstream along\nthe wooded shore to a pleasant dressing-room I knew among the dogwood\nbushes, all overgrown with wild grapevines. I began to undress for a\nswim. The girls would not be along yet. For the first time it occurred\nto me that I should be homesick for that river after I left it. The\nsandbars, with their clean white beaches and their little groves of\nwillows and cottonwood seedlings, were a sort of No Man’s Land, little\nnewly created worlds that belonged to the Black Hawk boys. Charley\nHarling and I had hunted through these woods, fished from the fallen\nlogs, until I knew every inch of the river shores and had a friendly\nfeeling for every bar and shallow.\n\nAfter my swim, while I was playing about indolently in the water, I\nheard the sound of hoofs and wheels on the bridge. I struck downstream\nand shouted, as the open spring wagon came into view on the middle span.\nThey stopped the horse, and the two girls in the bottom of the cart\nstood up, steadying themselves by the shoulders of the two in front,\nso that they could see me better. They were charming up there, huddled\ntogether in the cart and peering down at me like curious deer when they\ncome out of the thicket to drink. I found bottom near the bridge and\nstood up, waving to them.\n\n‘How pretty you look!’ I called.\n\n‘So do you!’ they shouted altogether, and broke into peals of laughter.\nAnna Hansen shook the reins and they drove on, while I zigzagged back to\nmy inlet and clambered up behind an overhanging elm. I dried myself in\nthe sun, and dressed slowly, reluctant to leave that green enclosure\nwhere the sunlight flickered so bright through the grapevine leaves and\nthe woodpecker hammered away in the crooked elm that trailed out over\nthe water. As I went along the road back to the bridge, I kept picking\noff little pieces of scaly chalk from the dried water gullies, and\nbreaking them up in my hands.\n\nWhen I came upon the Marshalls’ delivery horse, tied in the shade, the\ngirls had already taken their baskets and gone down the east road which\nwound through the sand and scrub. I could hear them calling to each\nother. The elder bushes did not grow back in the shady ravines between\nthe bluffs, but in the hot, sandy bottoms along the stream, where their\nroots were always in moisture and their tops in the sun. The blossoms\nwere unusually luxuriant and beautiful that summer.\n\nI followed a cattle path through the thick under-brush until I came to a\nslope that fell away abruptly to the water’s edge. A great chunk of\nthe shore had been bitten out by some spring freshet, and the scar was\nmasked by elder bushes, growing down to the water in flowery terraces. I\ndid not touch them. I was overcome by content and drowsiness and by the\nwarm silence about me. There was no sound but the high, singsong buzz\nof wild bees and the sunny gurgle of the water underneath. I peeped over\nthe edge of the bank to see the little stream that made the noise; it\nflowed along perfectly clear over the sand and gravel, cut off from the\nmuddy main current by a long sandbar. Down there, on the lower shelf of\nthe bank, I saw Antonia, seated alone under the pagoda-like elders. She\nlooked up when she heard me, and smiled, but I saw that she had been\ncrying. I slid down into the soft sand beside her and asked her what was\nthe matter.\n\n‘It makes me homesick, Jimmy, this flower, this smell,’ she said softly.\n‘We have this flower very much at home, in the old country. It always\ngrew in our yard and my papa had a green bench and a table under the\nbushes. In summer, when they were in bloom, he used to sit there with\nhis friend that played the trombone. When I was little I used to go down\nthere to hear them talk--beautiful talk, like what I never hear in this\ncountry.’\n\n‘What did they talk about?’ I asked her.\n\nShe sighed and shook her head. ‘Oh, I don’t know! About music, and\nthe woods, and about God, and when they were young.’ She turned to\nme suddenly and looked into my eyes. ‘You think, Jimmy, that maybe my\nfather’s spirit can go back to those old places?’\n\nI told her about the feeling of her father’s presence I had on that\nwinter day when my grandparents had gone over to see his dead body and I\nwas left alone in the house. I said I felt sure then that he was on his\nway back to his own country, and that even now, when I passed his grave,\nI always thought of him as being among the woods and fields that were so\ndear to him.\n\nAntonia had the most trusting, responsive eyes in the world; love and\ncredulousness seemed to look out of them with open faces.\n\n‘Why didn’t you ever tell me that before? It makes me feel more sure for\nhim.’ After a while she said: ‘You know, Jim, my father was different\nfrom my mother. He did not have to marry my mother, and all his brothers\nquarrelled with him because he did. I used to hear the old people at\nhome whisper about it. They said he could have paid my mother money, and\nnot married her. But he was older than she was, and he was too kind to\ntreat her like that. He lived in his mother’s house, and she was a poor\ngirl come in to do the work. After my father married her, my grandmother\nnever let my mother come into her house again. When I went to my\ngrandmother’s funeral was the only time I was ever in my grandmother’s\nhouse. Don’t that seem strange?’\n\nWhile she talked, I lay back in the hot sand and looked up at the blue\nsky between the flat bouquets of elder. I could hear the bees humming\nand singing, but they stayed up in the sun above the flowers and did not\ncome down into the shadow of the leaves. Antonia seemed to me that day\nexactly like the little girl who used to come to our house with Mr.\nShimerda.\n\n‘Some day, Tony, I am going over to your country, and I am going to the\nlittle town where you lived. Do you remember all about it?’\n\n‘Jim,’ she said earnestly, ‘if I was put down there in the middle of\nthe night, I could find my way all over that little town; and along the\nriver to the next town, where my grandmother lived. My feet remember all\nthe little paths through the woods, and where the big roots stick out to\ntrip you. I ain’t never forgot my own country.’\n\nThere was a crackling in the branches above us, and Lena Lingard peered\ndown over the edge of the bank.\n\n‘You lazy things!’ she cried. ‘All this elder, and you two lying there!\nDidn’t you hear us calling you?’ Almost as flushed as she had been in\nmy dream, she leaned over the edge of the bank and began to demolish our\nflowery pagoda. I had never seen her so energetic; she was panting with\nzeal, and the perspiration stood in drops on her short, yielding upper\nlip. I sprang to my feet and ran up the bank.\n\nIt was noon now, and so hot that the dogwoods and scrub-oaks began\nto turn up the silvery underside of their leaves, and all the foliage\nlooked soft and wilted. I carried the lunch-basket to the top of one\nof the chalk bluffs, where even on the calmest days there was always a\nbreeze. The flat-topped, twisted little oaks threw light shadows on the\ngrass. Below us we could see the windings of the river, and Black Hawk,\ngrouped among its trees, and, beyond, the rolling country, swelling\ngently until it met the sky. We could recognize familiar farm-houses and\nwindmills. Each of the girls pointed out to me the direction in which\nher father’s farm lay, and told me how many acres were in wheat that\nyear and how many in corn.\n\n‘My old folks,’ said Tiny Soderball, ‘have put in twenty acres of rye.\nThey get it ground at the mill, and it makes nice bread. It seems like\nmy mother ain’t been so homesick, ever since father’s raised rye flour\nfor her.’\n\n‘It must have been a trial for our mothers,’ said Lena, ‘coming out here\nand having to do everything different. My mother had always lived in\ntown. She says she started behind in farm-work, and never has caught\nup.’\n\n‘Yes, a new country’s hard on the old ones, sometimes,’ said Anna\nthoughtfully. ‘My grandmother’s getting feeble now, and her mind\nwanders. She’s forgot about this country, and thinks she’s at home in\nNorway. She keeps asking mother to take her down to the waterside and\nthe fish market. She craves fish all the time. Whenever I go home I take\nher canned salmon and mackerel.’\n\n‘Mercy, it’s hot!’ Lena yawned. She was supine under a little oak,\nresting after the fury of her elder-hunting, and had taken off the\nhigh-heeled slippers she had been silly enough to wear. ‘Come here, Jim.\nYou never got the sand out of your hair.’ She began to draw her fingers\nslowly through my hair.\n\nAntonia pushed her away. ‘You’ll never get it out like that,’ she said\nsharply. She gave my head a rough touzling and finished me off with\nsomething like a box on the ear. ‘Lena, you oughtn’t to try to wear\nthose slippers any more. They’re too small for your feet. You’d better\ngive them to me for Yulka.’\n\n‘All right,’ said Lena good-naturedly, tucking her white stockings under\nher skirt. ‘You get all Yulka’s things, don’t you? I wish father didn’t\nhave such bad luck with his farm machinery; then I could buy more things\nfor my sisters. I’m going to get Mary a new coat this fall, if the sulky\nplough’s never paid for!’\n\nTiny asked her why she didn’t wait until after Christmas, when coats\nwould be cheaper. ‘What do you think of poor me?’ she added; ‘with six\nat home, younger than I am? And they all think I’m rich, because when I\ngo back to the country I’m dressed so fine!’ She shrugged her shoulders.\n‘But, you know, my weakness is playthings. I like to buy them playthings\nbetter than what they need.’\n\n‘I know how that is,’ said Anna. ‘When we first came here, and I was\nlittle, we were too poor to buy toys. I never got over the loss of a\ndoll somebody gave me before we left Norway. A boy on the boat broke her\nand I still hate him for it.’\n\n‘I guess after you got here you had plenty of live dolls to nurse, like\nme!’ Lena remarked cynically.\n\n‘Yes, the babies came along pretty fast, to be sure. But I never minded.\nI was fond of them all. The youngest one, that we didn’t any of us want,\nis the one we love best now.’\n\nLena sighed. ‘Oh, the babies are all right; if only they don’t come in\nwinter. Ours nearly always did. I don’t see how mother stood it. I tell\nyou what, girls’--she sat up with sudden energy--‘I’m going to get my\nmother out of that old sod house where she’s lived so many years. The\nmen will never do it. Johnnie, that’s my oldest brother, he’s wanting to\nget married now, and build a house for his girl instead of his mother.\nMrs. Thomas says she thinks I can move to some other town pretty soon,\nand go into business for myself. If I don’t get into business, I’ll\nmaybe marry a rich gambler.’\n\n‘That would be a poor way to get on,’ said Anna sarcastically. ‘I wish\nI could teach school, like Selma Kronn. Just think! She’ll be the first\nScandinavian girl to get a position in the high school. We ought to be\nproud of her.’\n\nSelma was a studious girl, who had not much tolerance for giddy things\nlike Tiny and Lena; but they always spoke of her with admiration.\n\nTiny moved about restlessly, fanning herself with her straw hat. ‘If I\nwas smart like her, I’d be at my books day and night. But she was born\nsmart--and look how her father’s trained her! He was something high up\nin the old country.’\n\n‘So was my mother’s father,’ murmured Lena, ‘but that’s all the good it\ndoes us! My father’s father was smart, too, but he was wild. He married\na Lapp. I guess that’s what’s the matter with me; they say Lapp blood\nwill out.’\n\n‘A real Lapp, Lena?’ I exclaimed. ‘The kind that wear skins?’\n\n‘I don’t know if she wore skins, but she was a Lapps all right, and his\nfolks felt dreadful about it. He was sent up North on some government\njob he had, and fell in with her. He would marry her.’\n\n‘But I thought Lapland women were fat and ugly, and had squint eyes,\nlike Chinese?’ I objected.\n\n‘I don’t know, maybe. There must be something mighty taking about the\nLapp girls, though; mother says the Norwegians up North are always\nafraid their boys will run after them.’\n\nIn the afternoon, when the heat was less oppressive, we had a lively\ngame of ‘Pussy Wants a Corner,’ on the flat bluff-top, with the little\ntrees for bases. Lena was Pussy so often that she finally said she\nwouldn’t play any more. We threw ourselves down on the grass, out of\nbreath.\n\n‘Jim,’ Antonia said dreamily, ‘I want you to tell the girls about how\nthe Spanish first came here, like you and Charley Harling used to talk\nabout. I’ve tried to tell them, but I leave out so much.’\n\nThey sat under a little oak, Tony resting against the trunk and the\nother girls leaning against her and each other, and listened to the\nlittle I was able to tell them about Coronado and his search for the\nSeven Golden Cities. At school we were taught that he had not got so far\nnorth as Nebraska, but had given up his quest and turned back somewhere\nin Kansas. But Charley Harling and I had a strong belief that he had\nbeen along this very river. A farmer in the county north of ours, when\nhe was breaking sod, had turned up a metal stirrup of fine workmanship,\nand a sword with a Spanish inscription on the blade. He lent these\nrelics to Mr. Harling, who brought them home with him. Charley and I\nscoured them, and they were on exhibition in the Harling office all\nsummer. Father Kelly, the priest, had found the name of the Spanish\nmaker on the sword and an abbreviation that stood for the city of\nCordova.\n\n‘And that I saw with my own eyes,’ Antonia put in triumphantly. ‘So Jim\nand Charley were right, and the teachers were wrong!’\n\nThe girls began to wonder among themselves. Why had the Spaniards come\nso far? What must this country have been like, then? Why had Coronado\nnever gone back to Spain, to his riches and his castles and his king?\nI couldn’t tell them. I only knew the schoolbooks said he ‘died in the\nwilderness, of a broken heart.’\n\n‘More than him has done that,’ said Antonia sadly, and the girls\nmurmured assent.\n\nWe sat looking off across the country, watching the sun go down. The\ncurly grass about us was on fire now. The bark of the oaks turned red\nas copper. There was a shimmer of gold on the brown river. Out in the\nstream the sandbars glittered like glass, and the light trembled in the\nwillow thickets as if little flames were leaping among them. The breeze\nsank to stillness. In the ravine a ringdove mourned plaintively, and\nsomewhere off in the bushes an owl hooted. The girls sat listless,\nleaning against each other. The long fingers of the sun touched their\nforeheads.\n\nPresently we saw a curious thing: There were no clouds, the sun was\ngoing down in a limpid, gold-washed sky. Just as the lower edge of the\nred disk rested on the high fields against the horizon, a great black\nfigure suddenly appeared on the face of the sun. We sprang to our feet,\nstraining our eyes toward it. In a moment we realized what it was. On\nsome upland farm, a plough had been left standing in the field. The\nsun was sinking just behind it. Magnified across the distance by the\nhorizontal light, it stood out against the sun, was exactly contained\nwithin the circle of the disk; the handles, the tongue, the share--black\nagainst the molten red. There it was, heroic in size, a picture writing\non the sun.\n\nEven while we whispered about it, our vision disappeared; the ball\ndropped and dropped until the red tip went beneath the earth. The fields\nbelow us were dark, the sky was growing pale, and that forgotten plough\nhad sunk back to its own littleness somewhere on the prairie.\n\n\n\n\nXV\n\nLATE IN AUGUST the Cutters went to Omaha for a few days, leaving Antonia\nin charge of the house. Since the scandal about the Swedish girl, Wick\nCutter could never get his wife to stir out of Black Hawk without him.\n\nThe day after the Cutters left, Antonia came over to see us. Grandmother\nnoticed that she seemed troubled and distracted. ‘You’ve got something\non your mind, Antonia,’ she said anxiously.\n\n‘Yes, Mrs. Burden. I couldn’t sleep much last night.’ She hesitated, and\nthen told us how strangely Mr. Cutter had behaved before he went away.\nHe put all the silver in a basket and placed it under her bed, and with\nit a box of papers which he told her were valuable. He made her promise\nthat she would not sleep away from the house, or be out late in the\nevening, while he was gone. He strictly forbade her to ask any of the\ngirls she knew to stay with her at night. She would be perfectly safe,\nhe said, as he had just put a new Yale lock on the front door.\n\nCutter had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she\nfelt uncomfortable about staying there alone. She hadn’t liked the way\nhe kept coming into the kitchen to instruct her, or the way he looked at\nher. ‘I feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again, and is going to\ntry to scare me, somehow.’\n\nGrandmother was apprehensive at once. ‘I don’t think it’s right for you\nto stay there, feeling that way. I suppose it wouldn’t be right for\nyou to leave the place alone, either, after giving your word. Maybe Jim\nwould be willing to go over there and sleep, and you could come here\nnights. I’d feel safer, knowing you were under my own roof. I guess\nJim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you\ncould.’\n\nAntonia turned to me eagerly. ‘Oh, would you, Jim? I’d make up my bed\nnice and fresh for you. It’s a real cool room, and the bed’s right next\nthe window. I was afraid to leave the window open last night.’\n\nI liked my own room, and I didn’t like the Cutters’ house under any\ncircumstances; but Tony looked so troubled that I consented to try this\narrangement. I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I\ngot home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me. After\nprayers she sat down at the table with us, and it was like old times in\nthe country.\n\nThe third night I spent at the Cutters’, I awoke suddenly with the\nimpression that I had heard a door open and shut. Everything was still,\nhowever, and I must have gone to sleep again immediately.\n\nThe next thing I knew, I felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed.\nI was only half awake, but I decided that he might take the Cutters’\nsilver, whoever he was. Perhaps if I did not move, he would find it and\nget out without troubling me. I held my breath and lay absolutely still.\nA hand closed softly on my shoulder, and at the same moment I felt\nsomething hairy and cologne-scented brushing my face. If the room had\nsuddenly been flooded with electric light, I couldn’t have seen more\nclearly the detestable bearded countenance that I knew was bending over\nme. I caught a handful of whiskers and pulled, shouting something. The\nhand that held my shoulder was instantly at my throat. The man became\ninsane; he stood over me, choking me with one fist and beating me in the\nface with the other, hissing and chuckling and letting out a flood of\nabuse.\n\n‘So this is what she’s up to when I’m away, is it? Where is she, you\nnasty whelp, where is she? Under the bed, are you, hussy? I know your\ntricks! Wait till I get at you! I’ll fix this rat you’ve got in here.\nHe’s caught, all right!’\n\nSo long as Cutter had me by the throat, there was no chance for me at\nall. I got hold of his thumb and bent it back, until he let go with a\nyell. In a bound, I was on my feet, and easily sent him sprawling to the\nfloor. Then I made a dive for the open window, struck the wire screen,\nknocked it out, and tumbled after it into the yard.\n\nSuddenly I found myself running across the north end of Black Hawk in\nmy night-shirt, just as one sometimes finds one’s self behaving in\nbad dreams. When I got home, I climbed in at the kitchen window. I\nwas covered with blood from my nose and lip, but I was too sick to do\nanything about it. I found a shawl and an overcoat on the hat-rack, lay\ndown on the parlour sofa, and in spite of my hurts, went to sleep.\n\nGrandmother found me there in the morning. Her cry of fright awakened\nme. Truly, I was a battered object. As she helped me to my room, I\ncaught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My lip was cut and stood\nout like a snout. My nose looked like a big blue plum, and one eye was\nswollen shut and hideously discoloured. Grandmother said we must have\nthe doctor at once, but I implored her, as I had never begged for\nanything before, not to send for him. I could stand anything, I told\nher, so long as nobody saw me or knew what had happened to me. I\nentreated her not to let grandfather, even, come into my room. She\nseemed to understand, though I was too faint and miserable to go into\nexplanations. When she took off my night-shirt, she found such bruises\non my chest and shoulders that she began to cry. She spent the whole\nmorning bathing and poulticing me, and rubbing me with arnica. I heard\nAntonia sobbing outside my door, but I asked grandmother to send her\naway. I felt that I never wanted to see her again. I hated her almost as\nmuch as I hated Cutter. She had let me in for all this disgustingness.\nGrandmother kept saying how thankful we ought to be that I had been\nthere instead of Antonia. But I lay with my disfigured face to the wall\nand felt no particular gratitude. My one concern was that grandmother\nshould keep everyone away from me. If the story once got abroad, I would\nnever hear the last of it. I could well imagine what the old men down at\nthe drugstore would do with such a theme.\n\nWhile grandmother was trying to make me comfortable, grandfather went\nto the depot and learned that Wick Cutter had come home on the night\nexpress from the east, and had left again on the six o’clock train\nfor Denver that morning. The agent said his face was striped with\ncourt-plaster, and he carried his left hand in a sling. He looked so\nused up, that the agent asked him what had happened to him since ten\no’clock the night before; whereat Cutter began to swear at him and said\nhe would have him discharged for incivility.\n\nThat afternoon, while I was asleep, Antonia took grandmother with her,\nand went over to the Cutters’ to pack her trunk. They found the place\nlocked up, and they had to break the window to get into Antonia’s\nbedroom. There everything was in shocking disorder. Her clothes had\nbeen taken out of her closet, thrown into the middle of the room, and\ntrampled and torn. My own garments had been treated so badly that I\nnever saw them again; grandmother burned them in the Cutters’ kitchen\nrange.\n\nWhile Antonia was packing her trunk and putting her room in order,\nto leave it, the front doorbell rang violently. There stood Mrs.\nCutter--locked out, for she had no key to the new lock--her head\ntrembling with rage. ‘I advised her to control herself, or she would\nhave a stroke,’ grandmother said afterward.\n\nGrandmother would not let her see Antonia at all, but made her sit down\nin the parlour while she related to her just what had occurred the night\nbefore. Antonia was frightened, and was going home to stay for a while,\nshe told Mrs. Cutter; it would be useless to interrogate the girl, for\nshe knew nothing of what had happened.\n\nThen Mrs. Cutter told her story. She and her husband had started home\nfrom Omaha together the morning before. They had to stop over several\nhours at Waymore Junction to catch the Black Hawk train. During the\nwait, Cutter left her at the depot and went to the Waymore bank to\nattend to some business. When he returned, he told her that he would\nhave to stay overnight there, but she could go on home. He bought her\nticket and put her on the train. She saw him slip a twenty-dollar bill\ninto her handbag with her ticket. That bill, she said, should have\naroused her suspicions at once--but did not.\n\nThe trains are never called at little junction towns; everybody knows\nwhen they come in. Mr. Cutter showed his wife’s ticket to the conductor,\nand settled her in her seat before the train moved off. It was not until\nnearly nightfall that she discovered she was on the express bound for\nKansas City, that her ticket was made out to that point, and that Cutter\nmust have planned it so. The conductor told her the Black Hawk train was\ndue at Waymore twelve minutes after the Kansas City train left. She saw\nat once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to\nBlack Hawk without her. She had no choice but to go on to Kansas City\nand take the first fast train for home.\n\nCutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a\ndozen simpler devices; he could have left her in the Omaha hotel, and\nsaid he was going on to Chicago for a few days. But apparently it was\npart of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible.\n\n‘Mr. Cutter will pay for this, Mrs. Burden. He will pay!’ Mrs. Cutter\navouched, nodding her horse-like head and rolling her eyes.\n\nGrandmother said she hadn’t a doubt of it.\n\nCertainly Cutter liked to have his wife think him a devil. In some\nway he depended upon the excitement He could arouse in her hysterical\nnature. Perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wife’s\nrage and amazement than from any experiences of his own. His zest\nin debauchery might wane, but never Mrs. Cutter’s belief in it. The\nreckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he\ncounted on--like the last powerful liqueur after a long dinner. The\none excitement he really couldn’t do without was quarrelling with Mrs.\nCutter!\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK III. Lena Lingard\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nAT THE UNIVERSITY I had the good fortune to come immediately under the\ninfluence of a brilliant and inspiring young scholar. Gaston Cleric had\narrived in Lincoln only a few weeks earlier than I, to begin his work\nas head of the Latin Department. He came West at the suggestion of his\nphysicians, his health having been enfeebled by a long illness in Italy.\nWhen I took my entrance examinations, he was my examiner, and my course\nwas arranged under his supervision.\n\nI did not go home for my first summer vacation, but stayed in Lincoln,\nworking off a year’s Greek, which had been my only condition on entering\nthe freshman class. Cleric’s doctor advised against his going back to\nNew England, and, except for a few weeks in Colorado, he, too, was in\nLincoln all that summer. We played tennis, read, and took long walks\ntogether. I shall always look back on that time of mental awakening as\none of the happiest in my life. Gaston Cleric introduced me to the world\nof ideas; when one first enters that world everything else fades for\na time, and all that went before is as if it had not been. Yet I found\ncurious survivals; some of the figures of my old life seemed to be\nwaiting for me in the new.\n\n\nIn those days there were many serious young men among the students\nwho had come up to the university from the farms and the little towns\nscattered over the thinly settled state. Some of those boys came\nstraight from the cornfields with only a summer’s wages in their\npockets, hung on through the four years, shabby and underfed, and\ncompleted the course by really heroic self-sacrifice. Our instructors\nwere oddly assorted; wandering pioneer school-teachers, stranded\nministers of the Gospel, a few enthusiastic young men just out of\ngraduate schools. There was an atmosphere of endeavour, of expectancy\nand bright hopefulness about the young college that had lifted its head\nfrom the prairie only a few years before.\n\nOur personal life was as free as that of our instructors. There were\nno college dormitories; we lived where we could and as we could. I took\nrooms with an old couple, early settlers in Lincoln, who had married off\ntheir children and now lived quietly in their house at the edge of\ntown, near the open country. The house was inconveniently situated for\nstudents, and on that account I got two rooms for the price of one. My\nbedroom, originally a linen-closet, was unheated and was barely large\nenough to contain my cot-bed, but it enabled me to call the other room\nmy study. The dresser, and the great walnut wardrobe which held all\nmy clothes, even my hats and shoes, I had pushed out of the way, and I\nconsidered them non-existent, as children eliminate incongruous objects\nwhen they are playing house. I worked at a commodious green-topped table\nplaced directly in front of the west window which looked out over the\nprairie. In the corner at my right were all my books, in shelves I\nhad made and painted myself. On the blank wall at my left the dark,\nold-fashioned wall-paper was covered by a large map of ancient Rome, the\nwork of some German scholar. Cleric had ordered it for me when he was\nsending for books from abroad. Over the bookcase hung a photograph\nof the Tragic Theatre at Pompeii, which he had given me from his\ncollection.\n\nWhen I sat at work I half-faced a deep, upholstered chair which stood\nat the end of my table, its high back against the wall. I had bought it\nwith great care. My instructor sometimes looked in upon me when he\nwas out for an evening tramp, and I noticed that he was more likely to\nlinger and become talkative if I had a comfortable chair for him to sit\nin, and if he found a bottle of Benedictine and plenty of the kind\nof cigarettes he liked, at his elbow. He was, I had discovered,\nparsimonious about small expenditures--a trait absolutely inconsistent\nwith his general character. Sometimes when he came he was silent and\nmoody, and after a few sarcastic remarks went away again, to tramp the\nstreets of Lincoln, which were almost as quiet and oppressively domestic\nas those of Black Hawk. Again, he would sit until nearly midnight,\ntalking about Latin and English poetry, or telling me about his long\nstay in Italy.\n\nI can give no idea of the peculiar charm and vividness of his talk. In\na crowd he was nearly always silent. Even for his classroom he had no\nplatitudes, no stock of professorial anecdotes. When he was tired, his\nlectures were clouded, obscure, elliptical; but when he was interested\nthey were wonderful. I believe that Gaston Cleric narrowly missed\nbeing a great poet, and I have sometimes thought that his bursts of\nimaginative talk were fatal to his poetic gift. He squandered too much\nin the heat of personal communication. How often I have seen him draw\nhis dark brows together, fix his eyes upon some object on the wall or a\nfigure in the carpet, and then flash into the lamplight the very image\nthat was in his brain. He could bring the drama of antique life before\none out of the shadows--white figures against blue backgrounds. I shall\nnever forget his face as it looked one night when he told me about the\nsolitary day he spent among the sea temples at Paestum: the soft wind\nblowing through the roofless columns, the birds flying low over the\nflowering marsh grasses, the changing lights on the silver, cloud-hung\nmountains. He had wilfully stayed the short summer night there, wrapped\nin his coat and rug, watching the constellations on their path down\nthe sky until ‘the bride of old Tithonus’ rose out of the sea, and the\nmountains stood sharp in the dawn. It was there he caught the fever\nwhich held him back on the eve of his departure for Greece and of which\nhe lay ill so long in Naples. He was still, indeed, doing penance for\nit.\n\nI remember vividly another evening, when something led us to talk of\nDante’s veneration for Virgil. Cleric went through canto after canto\nof the ‘Commedia,’ repeating the discourse between Dante and his ‘sweet\nteacher,’ while his cigarette burned itself out unheeded between\nhis long fingers. I can hear him now, speaking the lines of the poet\nStatius, who spoke for Dante: ‘I was famous on earth with the name which\nendures longest and honours most. The seeds of my ardour were the sparks\nfrom that divine flame whereby more than a thousand have kindled; I\nspeak of the “Aeneid,” mother to me and nurse to me in poetry.’\n\nAlthough I admired scholarship so much in Cleric, I was not deceived\nabout myself; I knew that I should never be a scholar. I could never\nlose myself for long among impersonal things. Mental excitement was\napt to send me with a rush back to my own naked land and the figures\nscattered upon it. While I was in the very act of yearning toward the\nnew forms that Cleric brought up before me, my mind plunged away from\nme, and I suddenly found myself thinking of the places and people of my\nown infinitesimal past. They stood out strengthened and simplified now,\nlike the image of the plough against the sun. They were all I had for\nan answer to the new appeal. I begrudged the room that Jake and Otto and\nRussian Peter took up in my memory, which I wanted to crowd with other\nthings. But whenever my consciousness was quickened, all those\nearly friends were quickened within it, and in some strange way they\naccompanied me through all my new experiences. They were so much alive\nin me that I scarcely stopped to wonder whether they were alive anywhere\nelse, or how.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nONE MARCH EVENING in my sophomore year I was sitting alone in my room\nafter supper. There had been a warm thaw all day, with mushy yards and\nlittle streams of dark water gurgling cheerfully into the streets out of\nold snow-banks. My window was open, and the earthy wind blowing through\nmade me indolent. On the edge of the prairie, where the sun had gone\ndown, the sky was turquoise blue, like a lake, with gold light throbbing\nin it. Higher up, in the utter clarity of the western slope, the evening\nstar hung like a lamp suspended by silver chains--like the lamp engraved\nupon the title-page of old Latin texts, which is always appearing in new\nheavens, and waking new desires in men. It reminded me, at any rate, to\nshut my window and light my wick in answer. I did so regretfully, and\nthe dim objects in the room emerged from the shadows and took their\nplace about me with the helpfulness which custom breeds.\n\nI propped my book open and stared listlessly at the page of the\n‘Georgics’ where tomorrow’s lesson began. It opened with the melancholy\nreflection that, in the lives of mortals the best days are the first to\nflee. ‘Optima dies... prima fugit.’ I turned back to the beginning of\nthe third book, which we had read in class that morning. ‘Primus ego in\npatriam mecum... deducam Musas’; ‘for I shall be the first, if I live,\nto bring the Muse into my country.’ Cleric had explained to us that\n‘patria’ here meant, not a nation or even a province, but the little\nrural neighbourhood on the Mincio where the poet was born. This was not\na boast, but a hope, at once bold and devoutly humble, that he might\nbring the Muse (but lately come to Italy from her cloudy Grecian\nmountains), not to the capital, the palatia Romana, but to his own\nlittle I country’; to his father’s fields, ‘sloping down to the river\nand to the old beech trees with broken tops.’\n\nCleric said he thought Virgil, when he was dying at Brindisi, must have\nremembered that passage. After he had faced the bitter fact that he was\nto leave the ‘Aeneid’ unfinished, and had decreed that the great canvas,\ncrowded with figures of gods and men, should be burned rather than\nsurvive him unperfected, then his mind must have gone back to the\nperfect utterance of the ‘Georgics,’ where the pen was fitted to the\nmatter as the plough is to the furrow; and he must have said to himself,\nwith the thankfulness of a good man, ‘I was the first to bring the Muse\ninto my country.’\n\nWe left the classroom quietly, conscious that we had been brushed by the\nwing of a great feeling, though perhaps I alone knew Cleric intimately\nenough to guess what that feeling was. In the evening, as I sat staring\nat my book, the fervour of his voice stirred through the quantities on\nthe page before me. I was wondering whether that particular rocky strip\nof New England coast about which he had so often told me was Cleric’s\npatria. Before I had got far with my reading, I was disturbed by a\nknock. I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing\nin the dark hall.\n\n‘I expect you hardly know me, Jim.’\n\nThe voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped\ninto the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so\nquietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her\non the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure\nsmoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat\ndemurely on her yellow hair.\n\nI led her toward Cleric’s chair, the only comfortable one I had,\nquestioning her confusedly.\n\nShe was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with\nthe naive curiosity I remembered so well. ‘You are quite comfortable\nhere, aren’t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I’m in business for\nmyself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street.\nI’ve made a real good start.’\n\n‘But, Lena, when did you come?’\n\n‘Oh, I’ve been here all winter. Didn’t your grandmother ever write you?\nI’ve thought about looking you up lots of times. But we’ve all heard\nwhat a studious young man you’ve got to be, and I felt bashful. I didn’t\nknow whether you’d be glad to see me.’ She laughed her mellow, easy\nlaugh, that was either very artless or very comprehending, one never\nquite knew which. ‘You seem the same, though--except you’re a young man,\nnow, of course. Do you think I’ve changed?’\n\n‘Maybe you’re prettier--though you were always pretty enough. Perhaps\nit’s your clothes that make a difference.’\n\n‘You like my new suit? I have to dress pretty well in my business.’\n\nShe took off her jacket and sat more at ease in her blouse, of some\nsoft, flimsy silk. She was already at home in my place, had slipped\nquietly into it, as she did into everything. She told me her business\nwas going well, and she had saved a little money.\n\n‘This summer I’m going to build the house for mother I’ve talked about\nso long. I won’t be able to pay up on it at first, but I want her to\nhave it before she is too old to enjoy it. Next summer I’ll take her\ndown new furniture and carpets, so she’ll have something to look forward\nto all winter.’\n\nI watched Lena sitting there so smooth and sunny and well-cared-for, and\nthought of how she used to run barefoot over the prairie until after\nthe snow began to fly, and how Crazy Mary chased her round and round\nthe cornfields. It seemed to me wonderful that she should have got on so\nwell in the world. Certainly she had no one but herself to thank for it.\n\n‘You must feel proud of yourself, Lena,’ I said heartily. ‘Look at me;\nI’ve never earned a dollar, and I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to.’\n\n‘Tony says you’re going to be richer than Mr. Harling some day. She’s\nalways bragging about you, you know.’\n\n‘Tell me, how IS Tony?’\n\n‘She’s fine. She works for Mrs. Gardener at the hotel now. She’s\nhousekeeper. Mrs. Gardener’s health isn’t what it was, and she can’t\nsee after everything like she used to. She has great confidence in Tony.\nTony’s made it up with the Harlings, too. Little Nina is so fond of her\nthat Mrs. Harling kind of overlooked things.’\n\n‘Is she still going with Larry Donovan?’\n\n‘Oh, that’s on, worse than ever! I guess they’re engaged. Tony talks\nabout him like he was president of the railroad. Everybody laughs about\nit, because she was never a girl to be soft. She won’t hear a word\nagainst him. She’s so sort of innocent.’\n\nI said I didn’t like Larry, and never would.\n\nLena’s face dimpled. ‘Some of us could tell her things, but it wouldn’t\ndo any good. She’d always believe him. That’s Antonia’s failing, you\nknow; if she once likes people, she won’t hear anything against them.’\n\n‘I think I’d better go home and look after Antonia,’ I said.\n\n‘I think you had.’ Lena looked up at me in frank amusement. ‘It’s a good\nthing the Harlings are friendly with her again. Larry’s afraid of them.\nThey ship so much grain, they have influence with the railroad people.\nWhat are you studying?’ She leaned her elbows on the table and drew my\nbook toward her. I caught a faint odour of violet sachet. ‘So that’s\nLatin, is it? It looks hard. You do go to the theatre sometimes, though,\nfor I’ve seen you there. Don’t you just love a good play, Jim? I can’t\nstay at home in the evening if there’s one in town. I’d be willing to\nwork like a slave, it seems to me, to live in a place where there are\ntheatres.’\n\n‘Let’s go to a show together sometime. You are going to let me come to\nsee you, aren’t you?’\n\n‘Would you like to? I’d be ever so pleased. I’m never busy after six\no’clock, and I let my sewing girls go at half-past five. I board, to\nsave time, but sometimes I cook a chop for myself, and I’d be glad to\ncook one for you. Well’--she began to put on her white gloves--‘it’s\nbeen awful good to see you, Jim.’\n\n‘You needn’t hurry, need you? You’ve hardly told me anything yet.’\n\n‘We can talk when you come to see me. I expect you don’t often have lady\nvisitors. The old woman downstairs didn’t want to let me come up very\nmuch. I told her I was from your home town, and had promised your\ngrandmother to come and see you. How surprised Mrs. Burden would be!’\nLena laughed softly as she rose.\n\nWhen I caught up my hat, she shook her head. ‘No, I don’t want you to go\nwith me. I’m to meet some Swedes at the drugstore. You wouldn’t care for\nthem. I wanted to see your room so I could write Tony all about it, but\nI must tell her how I left you right here with your books. She’s always\nso afraid someone will run off with you!’ Lena slipped her silk sleeves\ninto the jacket I held for her, smoothed it over her person, and\nbuttoned it slowly. I walked with her to the door. ‘Come and see me\nsometimes when you’re lonesome. But maybe you have all the friends\nyou want. Have you?’ She turned her soft cheek to me. ‘Have you?’ she\nwhispered teasingly in my ear. In a moment I watched her fade down the\ndusky stairway.\n\nWhen I turned back to my room the place seemed much pleasanter than\nbefore. Lena had left something warm and friendly in the lamplight.\nHow I loved to hear her laugh again! It was so soft and unexcited and\nappreciative gave a favourable interpretation to everything. When I\nclosed my eyes I could hear them all laughing--the Danish laundry girls\nand the three Bohemian Marys. Lena had brought them all back to me. It\ncame over me, as it had never done before, the relation between girls\nlike those and the poetry of Virgil. If there were no girls like them in\nthe world, there would be no poetry. I understood that clearly, for the\nfirst time. This revelation seemed to me inestimably precious. I clung\nto it as if it might suddenly vanish.\n\nAs I sat down to my book at last, my old dream about Lena coming across\nthe harvest-field in her short skirt seemed to me like the memory of an\nactual experience. It floated before me on the page like a picture, and\nunderneath it stood the mournful line: ‘Optima dies... prima fugit.’\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nIN LINCOLN THE BEST part of the theatrical season came late, when the\ngood companies stopped off there for one-night stands, after their\nlong runs in New York and Chicago. That spring Lena went with me to\nsee Joseph Jefferson in ‘Rip Van Winkle,’ and to a war play called\n‘Shenandoah.’ She was inflexible about paying for her own seat; said\nshe was in business now, and she wouldn’t have a schoolboy spending\nhis money on her. I liked to watch a play with Lena; everything was\nwonderful to her, and everything was true. It was like going to revival\nmeetings with someone who was always being converted. She handed her\nfeelings over to the actors with a kind of fatalistic resignation.\nAccessories of costume and scene meant much more to her than to me.\nShe sat entranced through ‘Robin Hood’ and hung upon the lips of the\ncontralto who sang, ‘Oh, Promise Me!’\n\nToward the end of April, the billboards, which I watched anxiously in\nthose days, bloomed out one morning with gleaming white posters on which\ntwo names were impressively printed in blue Gothic letters: the name of\nan actress of whom I had often heard, and the name ‘Camille.’\n\nI called at the Raleigh Block for Lena on Saturday evening, and we\nwalked down to the theatre. The weather was warm and sultry and put us\nboth in a holiday humour. We arrived early, because Lena liked to watch\nthe people come in. There was a note on the programme, saying that the\n‘incidental music’ would be from the opera ‘Traviata,’ which was made\nfrom the same story as the play. We had neither of us read the play, and\nwe did not know what it was about--though I seemed to remember having\nheard it was a piece in which great actresses shone. ‘The Count of Monte\nCristo,’ which I had seen James O’Neill play that winter, was by the\nonly Alexandre Dumas I knew. This play, I saw, was by his son, and I\nexpected a family resemblance. A couple of jack-rabbits, run in off the\nprairie, could not have been more innocent of what awaited them than\nwere Lena and I.\n\nOur excitement began with the rise of the curtain, when the moody\nVarville, seated before the fire, interrogated Nanine. Decidedly, there\nwas a new tang about this dialogue. I had never heard in the theatre\nlines that were alive, that presupposed and took for granted, like those\nwhich passed between Varville and Marguerite in the brief encounter\nbefore her friends entered. This introduced the most brilliant, worldly,\nthe most enchantingly gay scene I had ever looked upon. I had never seen\nchampagne bottles opened on the stage before--indeed, I had never seen\nthem opened anywhere. The memory of that supper makes me hungry now;\nthe sight of it then, when I had only a students’ boarding-house dinner\nbehind me, was delicate torment. I seem to remember gilded chairs and\ntables (arranged hurriedly by footmen in white gloves and stockings),\nlinen of dazzling whiteness, glittering glass, silver dishes, a great\nbowl of fruit, and the reddest of roses. The room was invaded by\nbeautiful women and dashing young men, laughing and talking together.\nThe men were dressed more or less after the period in which the play was\nwritten; the women were not. I saw no inconsistency. Their talk seemed\nto open to one the brilliant world in which they lived; every sentence\nmade one older and wiser, every pleasantry enlarged one’s horizon.\nOne could experience excess and satiety without the inconvenience\nof learning what to do with one’s hands in a drawing-room! When the\ncharacters all spoke at once and I missed some of the phrases they\nflashed at each other, I was in misery. I strained my ears and eyes to\ncatch every exclamation.\n\nThe actress who played Marguerite was even then old-fashioned, though\nhistoric. She had been a member of Daly’s famous New York company, and\nafterward a ‘star’ under his direction. She was a woman who could not be\ntaught, it is said, though she had a crude natural force which carried\nwith people whose feelings were accessible and whose taste was not\nsqueamish. She was already old, with a ravaged countenance and a\nphysique curiously hard and stiff. She moved with difficulty--I think\nshe was lame--I seem to remember some story about a malady of the spine.\nHer Armand was disproportionately young and slight, a handsome youth,\nperplexed in the extreme. But what did it matter? I believed devoutly in\nher power to fascinate him, in her dazzling loveliness. I believed her\nyoung, ardent, reckless, disillusioned, under sentence, feverish, avid\nof pleasure. I wanted to cross the footlights and help the slim-waisted\nArmand in the frilled shirt to convince her that there was still loyalty\nand devotion in the world. Her sudden illness, when the gaiety was at\nits height, her pallor, the handkerchief she crushed against her lips,\nthe cough she smothered under the laughter while Gaston kept playing the\npiano lightly--it all wrung my heart. But not so much as her cynicism\nin the long dialogue with her lover which followed. How far was I from\nquestioning her unbelief! While the charmingly sincere young man pleaded\nwith her--accompanied by the orchestra in the old ‘Traviata’ duet,\n‘misterioso, misterios’ altero!’--she maintained her bitter scepticism,\nand the curtain fell on her dancing recklessly with the others, after\nArmand had been sent away with his flower.\n\nBetween the acts we had no time to forget. The orchestra kept sawing\naway at the ‘Traviata’ music, so joyous and sad, so thin and far-away,\nso clap-trap and yet so heart-breaking. After the second act I left Lena\nin tearful contemplation of the ceiling, and went out into the lobby\nto smoke. As I walked about there I congratulated myself that I had\nnot brought some Lincoln girl who would talk during the waits about the\njunior dances, or whether the cadets would camp at Plattsmouth. Lena was\nat least a woman, and I was a man.\n\nThrough the scene between Marguerite and the elder Duval, Lena wept\nunceasingly, and I sat helpless to prevent the closing of that chapter\nof idyllic love, dreading the return of the young man whose ineffable\nhappiness was only to be the measure of his fall.\n\nI suppose no woman could have been further in person, voice, and\ntemperament from Dumas’ appealing heroine than the veteran actress who\nfirst acquainted me with her. Her conception of the character was as\nheavy and uncompromising as her diction; she bore hard on the idea\nand on the consonants. At all times she was highly tragic, devoured by\nremorse. Lightness of stress or behaviour was far from her. Her voice\nwas heavy and deep: ‘Ar-r-r-mond!’ she would begin, as if she were\nsummoning him to the bar of Judgment. But the lines were enough. She had\nonly to utter them. They created the character in spite of her.\n\nThe heartless world which Marguerite re-entered with Varville had never\nbeen so glittering and reckless as on the night when it gathered in\nOlympe’s salon for the fourth act. There were chandeliers hung from the\nceiling, I remember, many servants in livery, gaming-tables where the\nmen played with piles of gold, and a staircase down which the guests\nmade their entrance. After all the others had gathered round the\ncard-tables and young Duval had been warned by Prudence, Marguerite\ndescended the staircase with Varville; such a cloak, such a fan, such\njewels--and her face! One knew at a glance how it was with her. When\nArmand, with the terrible words, ‘Look, all of you, I owe this woman\nnothing!’ flung the gold and bank-notes at the half-swooning Marguerite,\nLena cowered beside me and covered her face with her hands.\n\nThe curtain rose on the bedroom scene. By this time there wasn’t a nerve\nin me that hadn’t been twisted. Nanine alone could have made me cry. I\nloved Nanine tenderly; and Gaston, how one clung to that good fellow!\nThe New Year’s presents were not too much; nothing could be too much\nnow. I wept unrestrainedly. Even the handkerchief in my breast-pocket,\nworn for elegance and not at all for use, was wet through by the time\nthat moribund woman sank for the last time into the arms of her lover.\n\nWhen we reached the door of the theatre, the streets were shining with\nrain. I had prudently brought along Mrs. Harling’s useful Commencement\npresent, and I took Lena home under its shelter. After leaving her, I\nwalked slowly out into the country part of the town where I lived. The\nlilacs were all blooming in the yards, and the smell of them after the\nrain, of the new leaves and the blossoms together, blew into my face\nwith a sort of bitter sweetness. I tramped through the puddles and under\nthe showery trees, mourning for Marguerite Gauthier as if she had died\nonly yesterday, sighing with the spirit of 1840, which had sighed so\nmuch, and which had reached me only that night, across long years and\nseveral languages, through the person of an infirm old actress. The idea\nis one that no circumstances can frustrate. Wherever and whenever that\npiece is put on, it is April.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nHOW WELL I REMEMBER the stiff little parlour where I used to wait for\nLena: the hard horsehair furniture, bought at some auction sale, the\nlong mirror, the fashion-plates on the wall. If I sat down even for a\nmoment, I was sure to find threads and bits of coloured silk clinging\nto my clothes after I went away. Lena’s success puzzled me. She was so\neasygoing; had none of the push and self-assertiveness that get people\nahead in business. She had come to Lincoln, a country girl, with no\nintroductions except to some cousins of Mrs. Thomas who lived there, and\nshe was already making clothes for the women of ‘the young married set.’\nEvidently she had great natural aptitude for her work. She knew, as\nshe said, ‘what people looked well in.’ She never tired of poring over\nfashion-books. Sometimes in the evening I would find her alone in\nher work-room, draping folds of satin on a wire figure, with a quite\nblissful expression of countenance. I couldn’t help thinking that the\nyears when Lena literally hadn’t enough clothes to cover herself might\nhave something to do with her untiring interest in dressing the human\nfigure. Her clients said that Lena ‘had style,’ and overlooked her\nhabitual inaccuracies. She never, I discovered, finished anything by the\ntime she had promised, and she frequently spent more money on materials\nthan her customer had authorized. Once, when I arrived at six o’clock,\nLena was ushering out a fidgety mother and her awkward, overgrown\ndaughter. The woman detained Lena at the door to say apologetically:\n\n‘You’ll try to keep it under fifty for me, won’t you, Miss Lingard? You\nsee, she’s really too young to come to an expensive dressmaker, but I\nknew you could do more with her than anybody else.’\n\n‘Oh, that will be all right, Mrs. Herron. I think we’ll manage to get a\ngood effect,’ Lena replied blandly.\n\nI thought her manner with her customers very good, and wondered where\nshe had learned such self-possession.\n\nSometimes after my morning classes were over, I used to encounter Lena\ndowntown, in her velvet suit and a little black hat, with a veil tied\nsmoothly over her face, looking as fresh as the spring morning. Maybe\nshe would be carrying home a bunch of jonquils or a hyacinth plant. When\nwe passed a candy store her footsteps would hesitate and linger. ‘Don’t\nlet me go in,’ she would murmur. ‘Get me by if you can.’ She was very\nfond of sweets, and was afraid of growing too plump.\n\nWe had delightful Sunday breakfasts together at Lena’s. At the back of\nher long work-room was a bay-window, large enough to hold a box-couch\nand a reading-table. We breakfasted in this recess, after drawing the\ncurtains that shut out the long room, with cutting-tables and wire women\nand sheet-draped garments on the walls. The sunlight poured in, making\neverything on the table shine and glitter and the flame of the alcohol\nlamp disappear altogether. Lena’s curly black water-spaniel, Prince,\nbreakfasted with us. He sat beside her on the couch and behaved very\nwell until the Polish violin-teacher across the hall began to practise,\nwhen Prince would growl and sniff the air with disgust. Lena’s landlord,\nold Colonel Raleigh, had given her the dog, and at first she was not at\nall pleased. She had spent too much of her life taking care of animals\nto have much sentiment about them. But Prince was a knowing little\nbeast, and she grew fond of him. After breakfast I made him do his\nlessons; play dead dog, shake hands, stand up like a soldier. We used\nto put my cadet cap on his head--I had to take military drill at the\nuniversity--and give him a yard-measure to hold with his front leg. His\ngravity made us laugh immoderately.\n\nLena’s talk always amused me. Antonia had never talked like the people\nabout her. Even after she learned to speak English readily, there was\nalways something impulsive and foreign in her speech. But Lena had\npicked up all the conventional expressions she heard at Mrs. Thomas’s\ndressmaking shop. Those formal phrases, the very flower of small-town\nproprieties, and the flat commonplaces, nearly all hypocritical in their\norigin, became very funny, very engaging, when they were uttered in\nLena’s soft voice, with her caressing intonation and arch naivete.\nNothing could be more diverting than to hear Lena, who was almost as\ncandid as Nature, call a leg a ‘limb’ or a house a ‘home.’\n\nWe used to linger a long while over our coffee in that sunny corner.\nLena was never so pretty as in the morning; she wakened fresh with the\nworld every day, and her eyes had a deeper colour then, like the blue\nflowers that are never so blue as when they first open. I could sit idle\nall through a Sunday morning and look at her. Ole Benson’s behaviour was\nnow no mystery to me.\n\n‘There was never any harm in Ole,’ she said once. ‘People needn’t have\ntroubled themselves. He just liked to come over and sit on the drawside\nand forget about his bad luck. I liked to have him. Any company’s\nwelcome when you’re off with cattle all the time.’\n\n‘But wasn’t he always glum?’ I asked. ‘People said he never talked at\nall.’\n\n‘Sure he talked, in Norwegian. He’d been a sailor on an English boat and\nhad seen lots of queer places. He had wonderful tattoos. We used to sit\nand look at them for hours; there wasn’t much to look at out there. He\nwas like a picture book. He had a ship and a strawberry girl on one arm,\nand on the other a girl standing before a little house, with a fence and\ngate and all, waiting for her sweetheart. Farther up his arm, her sailor\nhad come back and was kissing her. “The Sailor’s Return,” he called it.’\n\nI admitted it was no wonder Ole liked to look at a pretty girl once in a\nwhile, with such a fright at home.\n\n‘You know,’ Lena said confidentially, ‘he married Mary because he\nthought she was strong-minded and would keep him straight. He never\ncould keep straight on shore. The last time he landed in Liverpool he’d\nbeen out on a two years’ voyage. He was paid off one morning, and by the\nnext he hadn’t a cent left, and his watch and compass were gone. He’d\ngot with some women, and they’d taken everything. He worked his way to\nthis country on a little passenger boat. Mary was a stewardess, and she\ntried to convert him on the way over. He thought she was just the one to\nkeep him steady. Poor Ole! He used to bring me candy from town, hidden\nin his feed-bag. He couldn’t refuse anything to a girl. He’d have given\naway his tattoos long ago, if he could. He’s one of the people I’m\nsorriest for.’\n\nIf I happened to spend an evening with Lena and stayed late, the Polish\nviolin-teacher across the hall used to come out and watch me descend the\nstairs, muttering so threateningly that it would have been easy to fall\ninto a quarrel with him. Lena had told him once that she liked to hear\nhim practise, so he always left his door open, and watched who came and\nwent.\n\n\nThere was a coolness between the Pole and Lena’s landlord on her\naccount. Old Colonel Raleigh had come to Lincoln from Kentucky and\ninvested an inherited fortune in real estate, at the time of inflated\nprices. Now he sat day after day in his office in the Raleigh Block,\ntrying to discover where his money had gone and how he could get some of\nit back. He was a widower, and found very little congenial companionship\nin this casual Western city. Lena’s good looks and gentle manners\nappealed to him. He said her voice reminded him of Southern voices, and\nhe found as many opportunities of hearing it as possible. He painted and\npapered her rooms for her that spring, and put in a porcelain bathtub in\nplace of the tin one that had satisfied the former tenant. While these\nrepairs were being made, the old gentleman often dropped in to consult\nLena’s preferences. She told me with amusement how Ordinsky, the Pole,\nhad presented himself at her door one evening, and said that if the\nlandlord was annoying her by his attentions, he would promptly put a\nstop to it.\n\n‘I don’t exactly know what to do about him,’ she said, shaking her head,\n‘he’s so sort of wild all the time. I wouldn’t like to have him say\nanything rough to that nice old man. The colonel is long-winded, but\nthen I expect he’s lonesome. I don’t think he cares much for Ordinsky,\neither. He said once that if I had any complaints to make of my\nneighbours, I mustn’t hesitate.’\n\nOne Saturday evening when I was having supper with Lena, we heard a\nknock at her parlour door, and there stood the Pole, coatless, in a\ndress shirt and collar. Prince dropped on his paws and began to growl\nlike a mastiff, while the visitor apologized, saying that he could\nnot possibly come in thus attired, but he begged Lena to lend him some\nsafety pins.\n\n‘Oh, you’ll have to come in, Mr. Ordinsky, and let me see what’s the\nmatter.’ She closed the door behind him. ‘Jim, won’t you make Prince\nbehave?’\n\nI rapped Prince on the nose, while Ordinsky explained that he had not\nhad his dress clothes on for a long time, and tonight, when he was going\nto play for a concert, his waistcoat had split down the back. He thought\nhe could pin it together until he got it to a tailor.\n\nLena took him by the elbow and turned him round. She laughed when she\nsaw the long gap in the satin. ‘You could never pin that, Mr. Ordinsky.\nYou’ve kept it folded too long, and the goods is all gone along the\ncrease. Take it off. I can put a new piece of lining-silk in there for\nyou in ten minutes.’ She disappeared into her work-room with the vest,\nleaving me to confront the Pole, who stood against the door like a\nwooden figure. He folded his arms and glared at me with his excitable,\nslanting brown eyes. His head was the shape of a chocolate drop, and was\ncovered with dry, straw-coloured hair that fuzzed up about his pointed\ncrown. He had never done more than mutter at me as I passed him, and\nI was surprised when he now addressed me. ‘Miss Lingard,’ he said\nhaughtily, ‘is a young woman for whom I have the utmost, the utmost\nrespect.’\n\n‘So have I,’ I said coldly.\n\nHe paid no heed to my remark, but began to do rapid finger-exercises on\nhis shirt-sleeves, as he stood with tightly folded arms.\n\n‘Kindness of heart,’ he went on, staring at the ceiling, ‘sentiment,\nare not understood in a place like this. The noblest qualities are\nridiculed. Grinning college boys, ignorant and conceited, what do they\nknow of delicacy!’\n\nI controlled my features and tried to speak seriously.\n\n‘If you mean me, Mr. Ordinsky, I have known Miss Lingard a long time,\nand I think I appreciate her kindness. We come from the same town, and\nwe grew up together.’\n\nHis gaze travelled slowly down from the ceiling and rested on me. ‘Am I\nto understand that you have this young woman’s interests at heart? That\nyou do not wish to compromise her?’\n\n‘That’s a word we don’t use much here, Mr. Ordinsky. A girl who makes\nher own living can ask a college boy to supper without being talked\nabout. We take some things for granted.’\n\n‘Then I have misjudged you, and I ask your pardon’--he bowed gravely.\n‘Miss Lingard,’ he went on, ‘is an absolutely trustful heart. She\nhas not learned the hard lessons of life. As for you and me, noblesse\noblige’--he watched me narrowly.\n\nLena returned with the vest. ‘Come in and let us look at you as you go\nout, Mr. Ordinsky. I’ve never seen you in your dress suit,’ she said as\nshe opened the door for him.\n\nA few moments later he reappeared with his violin-case a heavy muffler\nabout his neck and thick woollen gloves on his bony hands. Lena\nspoke encouragingly to him, and he went off with such an important\nprofessional air that we fell to laughing as soon as we had shut the\ndoor. ‘Poor fellow,’ Lena said indulgently, ‘he takes everything so\nhard.’\n\nAfter that Ordinsky was friendly to me, and behaved as if there\nwere some deep understanding between us. He wrote a furious article,\nattacking the musical taste of the town, and asked me to do him a great\nservice by taking it to the editor of the morning paper. If the editor\nrefused to print it, I was to tell him that he would be answerable to\nOrdinsky ‘in person.’ He declared that he would never retract one word,\nand that he was quite prepared to lose all his pupils. In spite of\nthe fact that nobody ever mentioned his article to him after it\nappeared--full of typographical errors which he thought intentional--he\ngot a certain satisfaction from believing that the citizens of Lincoln\nhad meekly accepted the epithet ‘coarse barbarians.’ ‘You see how\nit is,’ he said to me, ‘where there is no chivalry, there is no\namour-propre.’ When I met him on his rounds now, I thought he carried\nhis head more disdainfully than ever, and strode up the steps of front\nporches and rang doorbells with more assurance. He told Lena he would\nnever forget how I had stood by him when he was ‘under fire.’\n\nAll this time, of course, I was drifting. Lena had broken up my serious\nmood. I wasn’t interested in my classes. I played with Lena and Prince,\nI played with the Pole, I went buggy-riding with the old colonel, who\nhad taken a fancy to me and used to talk to me about Lena and the ‘great\nbeauties’ he had known in his youth. We were all three in love with\nLena.\n\n\nBefore the first of June, Gaston Cleric was offered an instructorship at\nHarvard College, and accepted it. He suggested that I should follow him\nin the fall, and complete my course at Harvard. He had found out about\nLena--not from me--and he talked to me seriously.\n\n‘You won’t do anything here now. You should either quit school and go\nto work, or change your college and begin again in earnest. You\nwon’t recover yourself while you are playing about with this handsome\nNorwegian. Yes, I’ve seen her with you at the theatre. She’s very\npretty, and perfectly irresponsible, I should judge.’\n\nCleric wrote my grandfather that he would like to take me East with him.\nTo my astonishment, grandfather replied that I might go if I wished. I\nwas both glad and sorry on the day when the letter came. I stayed in\nmy room all evening and thought things over. I even tried to persuade\nmyself that I was standing in Lena’s way--it is so necessary to be\na little noble!--and that if she had not me to play with, she would\nprobably marry and secure her future.\n\nThe next evening I went to call on Lena. I found her propped up on the\ncouch in her bay-window, with her foot in a big slipper. An awkward\nlittle Russian girl whom she had taken into her work-room had dropped a\nflat-iron on Lena’s toe. On the table beside her there was a basket\nof early summer flowers which the Pole had left after he heard of the\naccident. He always managed to know what went on in Lena’s apartment.\n\nLena was telling me some amusing piece of gossip about one of her\nclients, when I interrupted her and picked up the flower basket.\n\n‘This old chap will be proposing to you some day, Lena.’\n\n‘Oh, he has--often!’ she murmured.\n\n‘What! After you’ve refused him?’\n\n‘He doesn’t mind that. It seems to cheer him to mention the subject.\nOld men are like that, you know. It makes them feel important to think\nthey’re in love with somebody.’\n\n‘The colonel would marry you in a minute. I hope you won’t marry some\nold fellow; not even a rich one.’ Lena shifted her pillows and looked up\nat me in surprise.\n\n‘Why, I’m not going to marry anybody. Didn’t you know that?’\n\n‘Nonsense, Lena. That’s what girls say, but you know better. Every\nhandsome girl like you marries, of course.’\n\nShe shook her head. ‘Not me.’\n\n‘But why not? What makes you say that?’ I persisted.\n\nLena laughed.\n\n‘Well, it’s mainly because I don’t want a husband. Men are all right\nfor friends, but as soon as you marry them they turn into cranky old\nfathers, even the wild ones. They begin to tell you what’s sensible and\nwhat’s foolish, and want you to stick at home all the time. I prefer to\nbe foolish when I feel like it, and be accountable to nobody.’\n\n‘But you’ll be lonesome. You’ll get tired of this sort of life, and\nyou’ll want a family.’\n\n‘Not me. I like to be lonesome. When I went to work for Mrs. Thomas I\nwas nineteen years old, and I had never slept a night in my life when\nthere weren’t three in the bed. I never had a minute to myself except\nwhen I was off with the cattle.’\n\nUsually, when Lena referred to her life in the country at all, she\ndismissed it with a single remark, humorous or mildly cynical. But\ntonight her mind seemed to dwell on those early years. She told me she\ncouldn’t remember a time when she was so little that she wasn’t lugging\na heavy baby about, helping to wash for babies, trying to keep their\nlittle chapped hands and faces clean. She remembered home as a place\nwhere there were always too many children, a cross man and work piling\nup around a sick woman.\n\n‘It wasn’t mother’s fault. She would have made us comfortable if she\ncould. But that was no life for a girl! After I began to herd and milk,\nI could never get the smell of the cattle off me. The few underclothes I\nhad I kept in a cracker-box. On Saturday nights, after everybody was in\nbed, then I could take a bath if I wasn’t too tired. I could make two\ntrips to the windmill to carry water, and heat it in the wash-boiler on\nthe stove. While the water was heating, I could bring in a washtub out\nof the cave, and take my bath in the kitchen. Then I could put on a\nclean night-gown and get into bed with two others, who likely hadn’t\nhad a bath unless I’d given it to them. You can’t tell me anything about\nfamily life. I’ve had plenty to last me.’\n\n‘But it’s not all like that,’ I objected.\n\n‘Near enough. It’s all being under somebody’s thumb. What’s on your\nmind, Jim? Are you afraid I’ll want you to marry me some day?’\n\nThen I told her I was going away.\n\n‘What makes you want to go away, Jim? Haven’t I been nice to you?’\n\n‘You’ve been just awfully good to me, Lena,’ I blurted. ‘I don’t think\nabout much else. I never shall think about much else while I’m with you.\nI’ll never settle down and grind if I stay here. You know that.’\n\nI dropped down beside her and sat looking at the floor. I seemed to have\nforgotten all my reasonable explanations.\n\nLena drew close to me, and the little hesitation in her voice that had\nhurt me was not there when she spoke again.\n\n‘I oughtn’t to have begun it, ought I?’ she murmured. ‘I oughtn’t to\nhave gone to see you that first time. But I did want to. I guess I’ve\nalways been a little foolish about you. I don’t know what first put it\ninto my head, unless it was Antonia, always telling me I mustn’t be\nup to any of my nonsense with you. I let you alone for a long while,\nthough, didn’t I?’\n\nShe was a sweet creature to those she loved, that Lena Lingard!\n\nAt last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss.\n\n‘You aren’t sorry I came to see you that time?’ she whispered. ‘It\nseemed so natural. I used to think I’d like to be your first sweetheart.\nYou were such a funny kid!’\n\nShe always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away\nforever.\n\nWe said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to\nhinder me or hold me back. ‘You are going, but you haven’t gone yet,\nhave you?’ she used to say.\n\nMy Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a\nfew weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined\nCleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman’s Story\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at\nHarvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer\nvacation. On the night of my arrival, Mrs. Harling and Frances and\nSally came over to greet me. Everything seemed just as it used to be. My\ngrandparents looked very little older. Frances Harling was married now,\nand she and her husband managed the Harling interests in Black Hawk.\nWhen we gathered in grandmother’s parlour, I could hardly believe that I\nhad been away at all. One subject, however, we avoided all evening.\n\nWhen I was walking home with Frances, after we had left Mrs. Harling at\nher gate, she said simply, ‘You know, of course, about poor Antonia.’\n\nPoor Antonia! Everyone would be saying that now, I thought bitterly. I\nreplied that grandmother had written me how Antonia went away to marry\nLarry Donovan at some place where he was working; that he had deserted\nher, and that there was now a baby. This was all I knew.\n\n‘He never married her,’ Frances said. ‘I haven’t seen her since she came\nback. She lives at home, on the farm, and almost never comes to town.\nShe brought the baby in to show it to mama once. I’m afraid she’s\nsettled down to be Ambrosch’s drudge for good.’\n\nI tried to shut Antonia out of my mind. I was bitterly disappointed in\nher. I could not forgive her for becoming an object of pity, while\nLena Lingard, for whom people had always foretold trouble, was now the\nleading dressmaker of Lincoln, much respected in Black Hawk. Lena gave\nher heart away when she felt like it, but she kept her head for her\nbusiness and had got on in the world.\n\nJust then it was the fashion to speak indulgently of Lena and severely\nof Tiny Soderball, who had quietly gone West to try her fortune the year\nbefore. A Black Hawk boy, just back from Seattle, brought the news that\nTiny had not gone to the coast on a venture, as she had allowed people\nto think, but with very definite plans. One of the roving promoters\nthat used to stop at Mrs. Gardener’s hotel owned idle property along the\nwaterfront in Seattle, and he had offered to set Tiny up in business\nin one of his empty buildings. She was now conducting a sailors’\nlodging-house. This, everyone said, would be the end of Tiny. Even if\nshe had begun by running a decent place, she couldn’t keep it up; all\nsailors’ boarding-houses were alike.\n\nWhen I thought about it, I discovered that I had never known Tiny as\nwell as I knew the other girls. I remembered her tripping briskly about\nthe dining-room on her high heels, carrying a big trayful of dishes,\nglancing rather pertly at the spruce travelling men, and contemptuously\nat the scrubby ones--who were so afraid of her that they didn’t dare\nto ask for two kinds of pie. Now it occurred to me that perhaps the\nsailors, too, might be afraid of Tiny. How astonished we should have\nbeen, as we sat talking about her on Frances Harling’s front porch, if\nwe could have known what her future was really to be! Of all the girls\nand boys who grew up together in Black Hawk, Tiny Soderball was to lead\nthe most adventurous life and to achieve the most solid worldly success.\n\nThis is what actually happened to Tiny: While she was running her\nlodging-house in Seattle, gold was discovered in Alaska. Miners and\nsailors came back from the North with wonderful stories and pouches of\ngold. Tiny saw it and weighed it in her hands. That daring, which nobody\nhad ever suspected in her, awoke. She sold her business and set out\nfor Circle City, in company with a carpenter and his wife whom she had\npersuaded to go along with her. They reached Skaguay in a snowstorm,\nwent in dog-sledges over the Chilkoot Pass, and shot the Yukon in\nflatboats. They reached Circle City on the very day when some Siwash\nIndians came into the settlement with the report that there had been a\nrich gold strike farther up the river, on a certain Klondike Creek.\nTwo days later Tiny and her friends, and nearly everyone else in Circle\nCity, started for the Klondike fields on the last steamer that went\nup the Yukon before it froze for the winter. That boatload of people\nfounded Dawson City. Within a few weeks there were fifteen hundred\nhomeless men in camp. Tiny and the carpenter’s wife began to cook for\nthem, in a tent. The miners gave her a building lot, and the carpenter\nput up a log hotel for her. There she sometimes fed a hundred and fifty\nmen a day. Miners came in on snowshoes from their placer claims twenty\nmiles away to buy fresh bread from her, and paid for it in gold.\n\nThat winter Tiny kept in her hotel a Swede whose legs had been frozen\none night in a storm when he was trying to find his way back to his\ncabin. The poor fellow thought it great good fortune to be cared for by\na woman, and a woman who spoke his own tongue. When he was told that\nhis feet must be amputated, he said he hoped he would not get well; what\ncould a working-man do in this hard world without feet? He did, in fact,\ndie from the operation, but not before he had deeded Tiny Soderball his\nclaim on Hunker Creek. Tiny sold her hotel, invested half her money in\nDawson building lots, and with the rest she developed her claim. She\nwent off into the wilds and lived on the claim. She bought other claims\nfrom discouraged miners, traded or sold them on percentages.\n\nAfter nearly ten years in the Klondike, Tiny returned, with a\nconsiderable fortune, to live in San Francisco. I met her in Salt Lake\nCity in 1908. She was a thin, hard-faced woman, very well-dressed, very\nreserved in manner. Curiously enough, she reminded me of Mrs. Gardener,\nfor whom she had worked in Black Hawk so long ago. She told me about\nsome of the desperate chances she had taken in the gold country, but the\nthrill of them was quite gone. She said frankly that nothing interested\nher much now but making money. The only two human beings of whom she\nspoke with any feeling were the Swede, Johnson, who had given her his\nclaim, and Lena Lingard. She had persuaded Lena to come to San Francisco\nand go into business there.\n\n\n‘Lincoln was never any place for her,’ Tiny remarked. ‘In a town of that\nsize Lena would always be gossiped about. Frisco’s the right field\nfor her. She has a fine class of trade. Oh, she’s just the same as\nshe always was! She’s careless, but she’s level-headed. She’s the only\nperson I know who never gets any older. It’s fine for me to have her\nthere; somebody who enjoys things like that. She keeps an eye on me and\nwon’t let me be shabby. When she thinks I need a new dress, she makes it\nand sends it home with a bill that’s long enough, I can tell you!’\n\nTiny limped slightly when she walked. The claim on Hunker Creek took\ntoll from its possessors. Tiny had been caught in a sudden turn of\nweather, like poor Johnson. She lost three toes from one of those pretty\nlittle feet that used to trip about Black Hawk in pointed slippers and\nstriped stockings. Tiny mentioned this mutilation quite casually--didn’t\nseem sensitive about it. She was satisfied with her success, but not\nelated. She was like someone in whom the faculty of becoming interested\nis worn out.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nSOON AFTER I GOT home that summer, I persuaded my grandparents to have\ntheir photographs taken, and one morning I went into the photographer’s\nshop to arrange for sittings. While I was waiting for him to come out of\nhis developing-room, I walked about trying to recognize the likenesses\non his walls: girls in Commencement dresses, country brides and grooms\nholding hands, family groups of three generations. I noticed, in a\nheavy frame, one of those depressing ‘crayon enlargements’ often seen\nin farm-house parlours, the subject being a round-eyed baby in short\ndresses. The photographer came out and gave a constrained, apologetic\nlaugh.\n\n‘That’s Tony Shimerda’s baby. You remember her; she used to be the\nHarlings’ Tony. Too bad! She seems proud of the baby, though; wouldn’t\nhear to a cheap frame for the picture. I expect her brother will be in\nfor it Saturday.’\n\nI went away feeling that I must see Antonia again. Another girl would\nhave kept her baby out of sight, but Tony, of course, must have its\npicture on exhibition at the town photographer’s, in a great gilt frame.\nHow like her! I could forgive her, I told myself, if she hadn’t thrown\nherself away on such a cheap sort of fellow.\n\nLarry Donovan was a passenger conductor, one of those train-crew\naristocrats who are always afraid that someone may ask them to put up\na car-window, and who, if requested to perform such a menial service,\nsilently point to the button that calls the porter. Larry wore this\nair of official aloofness even on the street, where there were no\ncar-windows to compromise his dignity. At the end of his run he stepped\nindifferently from the train along with the passengers, his street\nhat on his head and his conductor’s cap in an alligator-skin bag, went\ndirectly into the station and changed his clothes. It was a matter of\nthe utmost importance to him never to be seen in his blue trousers away\nfrom his train. He was usually cold and distant with men, but with\nall women he had a silent, grave familiarity, a special handshake,\naccompanied by a significant, deliberate look. He took women, married or\nsingle, into his confidence; walked them up and down in the moonlight,\ntelling them what a mistake he had made by not entering the office\nbranch of the service, and how much better fitted he was to fill the\npost of General Passenger Agent in Denver than the rough-shod man who\nthen bore that title. His unappreciated worth was the tender secret\nLarry shared with his sweethearts, and he was always able to make some\nfoolish heart ache over it.\n\nAs I drew near home that morning, I saw Mrs. Harling out in her yard,\ndigging round her mountain-ash tree. It was a dry summer, and she had\nnow no boy to help her. Charley was off in his battleship, cruising\nsomewhere on the Caribbean sea. I turned in at the gate it was with a\nfeeling of pleasure that I opened and shut that gate in those days;\nI liked the feel of it under my hand. I took the spade away from Mrs.\nHarling, and while I loosened the earth around the tree, she sat down\non the steps and talked about the oriole family that had a nest in its\nbranches.\n\n‘Mrs. Harling,’ I said presently, ‘I wish I could find out exactly how\nAntonia’s marriage fell through.’\n\n‘Why don’t you go out and see your grandfather’s tenant, the Widow\nSteavens? She knows more about it than anybody else. She helped Antonia\nget ready to be married, and she was there when Antonia came back. She\ntook care of her when the baby was born. She could tell you everything.\nBesides, the Widow Steavens is a good talker, and she has a remarkable\nmemory.’\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nON THE FIRST OR second day of August I got a horse and cart and set out\nfor the high country, to visit the Widow Steavens. The wheat harvest was\nover, and here and there along the horizon I could see black puffs of\nsmoke from the steam threshing-machines. The old pasture land was now\nbeing broken up into wheatfields and cornfields, the red grass was\ndisappearing, and the whole face of the country was changing. There\nwere wooden houses where the old sod dwellings used to be, and little\norchards, and big red barns; all this meant happy children, contented\nwomen, and men who saw their lives coming to a fortunate issue. The\nwindy springs and the blazing summers, one after another, had enriched\nand mellowed that flat tableland; all the human effort that had gone\ninto it was coming back in long, sweeping lines of fertility. The\nchanges seemed beautiful and harmonious to me; it was like watching the\ngrowth of a great man or of a great idea. I recognized every tree and\nsandbank and rugged draw. I found that I remembered the conformation of\nthe land as one remembers the modelling of human faces.\n\nWhen I drew up to our old windmill, the Widow Steavens came out to meet\nme. She was brown as an Indian woman, tall, and very strong. When I was\nlittle, her massive head had always seemed to me like a Roman senator’s.\nI told her at once why I had come.\n\n‘You’ll stay the night with us, Jimmy? I’ll talk to you after supper. I\ncan take more interest when my work is off my mind. You’ve no prejudice\nagainst hot biscuit for supper? Some have, these days.’\n\nWhile I was putting my horse away, I heard a rooster squawking. I looked\nat my watch and sighed; it was three o’clock, and I knew that I must eat\nhim at six.\n\nAfter supper Mrs. Steavens and I went upstairs to the old sitting-room,\nwhile her grave, silent brother remained in the basement to read his\nfarm papers. All the windows were open. The white summer moon was\nshining outside, the windmill was pumping lazily in the light breeze. My\nhostess put the lamp on a stand in the corner, and turned it low because\nof the heat. She sat down in her favourite rocking-chair and settled\na little stool comfortably under her tired feet. ‘I’m troubled with\ncalluses, Jim; getting old,’ she sighed cheerfully. She crossed her\nhands in her lap and sat as if she were at a meeting of some kind.\n\n‘Now, it’s about that dear Antonia you want to know? Well, you’ve come\nto the right person. I’ve watched her like she’d been my own daughter.\n\n‘When she came home to do her sewing that summer before she was to\nbe married, she was over here about every day. They’ve never had a\nsewing-machine at the Shimerdas’, and she made all her things here. I\ntaught her hemstitching, and I helped her to cut and fit. She used\nto sit there at that machine by the window, pedalling the life out of\nit--she was so strong--and always singing them queer Bohemian songs,\nlike she was the happiest thing in the world.\n\n‘“Antonia,” I used to say, “don’t run that machine so fast. You won’t\nhasten the day none that way.”\n\n‘Then she’d laugh and slow down for a little, but she’d soon forget and\nbegin to pedal and sing again. I never saw a girl work harder to go to\nhousekeeping right and well-prepared. Lovely table-linen the Harlings\nhad given her, and Lena Lingard had sent her nice things from Lincoln.\nWe hemstitched all the tablecloths and pillow-cases, and some of\nthe sheets. Old Mrs. Shimerda knit yards and yards of lace for her\nunderclothes. Tony told me just how she meant to have everything in her\nhouse. She’d even bought silver spoons and forks, and kept them in her\ntrunk. She was always coaxing brother to go to the post-office. Her\nyoung man did write her real often, from the different towns along his\nrun.\n\n‘The first thing that troubled her was when he wrote that his run had\nbeen changed, and they would likely have to live in Denver. “I’m a\ncountry girl,” she said, “and I doubt if I’ll be able to manage so well\nfor him in a city. I was counting on keeping chickens, and maybe a cow.”\n She soon cheered up, though.\n\n‘At last she got the letter telling her when to come. She was shaken by\nit; she broke the seal and read it in this room. I suspected then that\nshe’d begun to get faint-hearted, waiting; though she’d never let me see\nit.\n\n‘Then there was a great time of packing. It was in March, if I remember\nrightly, and a terrible muddy, raw spell, with the roads bad for hauling\nher things to town. And here let me say, Ambrosch did the right thing.\nHe went to Black Hawk and bought her a set of plated silver in a purple\nvelvet box, good enough for her station. He gave her three hundred\ndollars in money; I saw the cheque. He’d collected her wages all those\nfirst years she worked out, and it was but right. I shook him by the\nhand in this room. “You’re behaving like a man, Ambrosch,” I said, “and\nI’m glad to see it, son.”\n\n‘’Twas a cold, raw day he drove her and her three trunks into Black Hawk\nto take the night train for Denver--the boxes had been shipped before.\nHe stopped the wagon here, and she ran in to tell me good-bye. She threw\nher arms around me and kissed me, and thanked me for all I’d done for\nher. She was so happy she was crying and laughing at the same time, and\nher red cheeks was all wet with rain.\n\n‘“You’re surely handsome enough for any man,” I said, looking her over.\n\n‘She laughed kind of flighty like, and whispered, “Good-bye, dear\nhouse!” and then ran out to the wagon. I expect she meant that for you\nand your grandmother, as much as for me, so I’m particular to tell you.\nThis house had always been a refuge to her.\n\n‘Well, in a few days we had a letter saying she got to Denver safe, and\nhe was there to meet her. They were to be married in a few days. He was\ntrying to get his promotion before he married, she said. I didn’t like\nthat, but I said nothing. The next week Yulka got a postal card, saying\nshe was “well and happy.” After that we heard nothing. A month went by,\nand old Mrs. Shimerda began to get fretful. Ambrosch was as sulky with\nme as if I’d picked out the man and arranged the match.\n\n‘One night brother William came in and said that on his way back from\nthe fields he had passed a livery team from town, driving fast out the\nwest road. There was a trunk on the front seat with the driver, and\nanother behind. In the back seat there was a woman all bundled up;\nbut for all her veils, he thought ‘twas Antonia Shimerda, or Antonia\nDonovan, as her name ought now to be.\n\n‘The next morning I got brother to drive me over. I can walk still, but\nmy feet ain’t what they used to be, and I try to save myself. The lines\noutside the Shimerdas’ house was full of washing, though it was the\nmiddle of the week. As we got nearer, I saw a sight that made my\nheart sink--all those underclothes we’d put so much work on, out there\nswinging in the wind. Yulka came bringing a dishpanful of wrung clothes,\nbut she darted back into the house like she was loath to see us. When\nI went in, Antonia was standing over the tubs, just finishing up a big\nwashing. Mrs. Shimerda was going about her work, talking and scolding\nto herself. She didn’t so much as raise her eyes. Tony wiped her hand on\nher apron and held it out to me, looking at me steady but mournful. When\nI took her in my arms she drew away. “Don’t, Mrs. Steavens,” she says,\n“you’ll make me cry, and I don’t want to.”\n\n‘I whispered and asked her to come out-of-doors with me. I knew she\ncouldn’t talk free before her mother. She went out with me, bareheaded,\nand we walked up toward the garden.\n\n‘“I’m not married, Mrs. Steavens,” she says to me very quiet and\nnatural-like, “and I ought to be.”\n\n‘“Oh, my child,” says I, “what’s happened to you? Don’t be afraid to\ntell me!”\n\n‘She sat down on the drawside, out of sight of the house. “He’s run away\nfrom me,” she said. “I don’t know if he ever meant to marry me.”\n\n‘“You mean he’s thrown up his job and quit the country?” says I.\n\n‘“He didn’t have any job. He’d been fired; blacklisted for knocking down\nfares. I didn’t know. I thought he hadn’t been treated right. He was\nsick when I got there. He’d just come out of the hospital. He lived with\nme till my money gave out, and afterward I found he hadn’t really been\nhunting work at all. Then he just didn’t come back. One nice fellow at\nthe station told me, when I kept going to look for him, to give it up.\nHe said he was afraid Larry’d gone bad and wouldn’t come back any more.\nI guess he’s gone to Old Mexico. The conductors get rich down there,\ncollecting half-fares off the natives and robbing the company. He was\nalways talking about fellows who had got ahead that way.”\n\n‘I asked her, of course, why she didn’t insist on a civil marriage at\nonce--that would have given her some hold on him. She leaned her head\non her hands, poor child, and said, “I just don’t know, Mrs. Steavens. I\nguess my patience was wore out, waiting so long. I thought if he saw how\nwell I could do for him, he’d want to stay with me.”\n\n‘Jimmy, I sat right down on that bank beside her and made lament.\nI cried like a young thing. I couldn’t help it. I was just about\nheart-broke. It was one of them lovely warm May days, and the wind was\nblowing and the colts jumping around in the pastures; but I felt bowed\nwith despair. My Antonia, that had so much good in her, had come home\ndisgraced. And that Lena Lingard, that was always a bad one, say what\nyou will, had turned out so well, and was coming home here every summer\nin her silks and her satins, and doing so much for her mother. I give\ncredit where credit is due, but you know well enough, Jim Burden, there\nis a great difference in the principles of those two girls. And here it\nwas the good one that had come to grief! I was poor comfort to her. I\nmarvelled at her calm. As we went back to the house, she stopped to feel\nof her clothes to see if they was drying well, and seemed to take pride\nin their whiteness--she said she’d been living in a brick block, where\nshe didn’t have proper conveniences to wash them.\n\n‘The next time I saw Antonia, she was out in the fields ploughing corn.\nAll that spring and summer she did the work of a man on the farm; it\nseemed to be an understood thing. Ambrosch didn’t get any other hand\nto help him. Poor Marek had got violent and been sent away to an\ninstitution a good while back. We never even saw any of Tony’s pretty\ndresses. She didn’t take them out of her trunks. She was quiet and\nsteady. Folks respected her industry and tried to treat her as if\nnothing had happened. They talked, to be sure; but not like they would\nif she’d put on airs. She was so crushed and quiet that nobody seemed to\nwant to humble her. She never went anywhere. All that summer she never\nonce came to see me. At first I was hurt, but I got to feel that it was\nbecause this house reminded her of too much. I went over there when I\ncould, but the times when she was in from the fields were the times when\nI was busiest here. She talked about the grain and the weather as if\nshe’d never had another interest, and if I went over at night she always\nlooked dead weary. She was afflicted with toothache; one tooth after\nanother ulcerated, and she went about with her face swollen half the\ntime. She wouldn’t go to Black Hawk to a dentist for fear of meeting\npeople she knew. Ambrosch had got over his good spell long ago, and was\nalways surly. Once I told him he ought not to let Antonia work so hard\nand pull herself down. He said, “If you put that in her head, you better\nstay home.” And after that I did.\n\n‘Antonia worked on through harvest and threshing, though she was too\nmodest to go out threshing for the neighbours, like when she was young\nand free. I didn’t see much of her until late that fall when she begun\nto herd Ambrosch’s cattle in the open ground north of here, up toward\nthe big dog-town. Sometimes she used to bring them over the west hill,\nthere, and I would run to meet her and walk north a piece with her. She\nhad thirty cattle in her bunch; it had been dry, and the pasture was\nshort, or she wouldn’t have brought them so far.\n\n‘It was a fine open fall, and she liked to be alone. While the steers\ngrazed, she used to sit on them grassy banks along the draws and sun\nherself for hours. Sometimes I slipped up to visit with her, when she\nhadn’t gone too far.\n\n‘“It does seem like I ought to make lace, or knit like Lena used to,”\n she said one day, “but if I start to work, I look around and forget\nto go on. It seems such a little while ago when Jim Burden and I was\nplaying all over this country. Up here I can pick out the very places\nwhere my father used to stand. Sometimes I feel like I’m not going to\nlive very long, so I’m just enjoying every day of this fall.”\n\n‘After the winter begun she wore a man’s long overcoat and boots, and a\nman’s felt hat with a wide brim. I used to watch her coming and\ngoing, and I could see that her steps were getting heavier. One day in\nDecember, the snow began to fall. Late in the afternoon I saw Antonia\ndriving her cattle homeward across the hill. The snow was flying round\nher and she bent to face it, looking more lonesome-like to me than\nusual. “Deary me,” I says to myself, “the girl’s stayed out too late.\nIt’ll be dark before she gets them cattle put into the corral.” I seemed\nto sense she’d been feeling too miserable to get up and drive them.\n\n‘That very night, it happened. She got her cattle home, turned them into\nthe corral, and went into the house, into her room behind the kitchen,\nand shut the door. There, without calling to anybody, without a groan,\nshe lay down on the bed and bore her child.\n\n‘I was lifting supper when old Mrs. Shimerda came running down the\nbasement stairs, out of breath and screeching:\n\n‘“Baby come, baby come!” she says. “Ambrosch much like devil!”\n\n‘Brother William is surely a patient man. He was just ready to sit down\nto a hot supper after a long day in the fields. Without a word he rose\nand went down to the barn and hooked up his team. He got us over there\nas quick as it was humanly possible. I went right in, and began to do\nfor Antonia; but she laid there with her eyes shut and took no account\nof me. The old woman got a tubful of warm water to wash the baby. I\noverlooked what she was doing and I said out loud: “Mrs. Shimerda,\ndon’t you put that strong yellow soap near that baby. You’ll blister its\nlittle skin.” I was indignant.\n\n‘“Mrs. Steavens,” Antonia said from the bed, “if you’ll look in the top\ntray of my trunk, you’ll see some fine soap.” That was the first word\nshe spoke.\n\n‘After I’d dressed the baby, I took it out to show it to Ambrosch. He\nwas muttering behind the stove and wouldn’t look at it.\n\n‘“You’d better put it out in the rain-barrel,” he says.\n\n‘“Now, see here, Ambrosch,” says I, “there’s a law in this land, don’t\nforget that. I stand here a witness that this baby has come into the\nworld sound and strong, and I intend to keep an eye on what befalls it.”\n I pride myself I cowed him.\n\n‘Well I expect you’re not much interested in babies, but Antonia’s got\non fine. She loved it from the first as dearly as if she’d had a ring\non her finger, and was never ashamed of it. It’s a year and eight\nmonths old now, and no baby was ever better cared-for. Antonia is a\nnatural-born mother. I wish she could marry and raise a family, but I\ndon’t know as there’s much chance now.’\n\n\nI slept that night in the room I used to have when I was a little boy,\nwith the summer wind blowing in at the windows, bringing the smell of\nthe ripe fields. I lay awake and watched the moonlight shining over the\nbarn and the stacks and the pond, and the windmill making its old dark\nshadow against the blue sky.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nTHE NEXT AFTERNOON I walked over to the Shimerdas’. Yulka showed me\nthe baby and told me that Antonia was shocking wheat on the southwest\nquarter. I went down across the fields, and Tony saw me from a long way\noff. She stood still by her shocks, leaning on her pitchfork, watching\nme as I came. We met like the people in the old song, in silence, if not\nin tears. Her warm hand clasped mine.\n\n‘I thought you’d come, Jim. I heard you were at Mrs. Steavens’s last\nnight. I’ve been looking for you all day.’\n\nShe was thinner than I had ever seen her, and looked as Mrs. Steavens\nsaid, ‘worked down,’ but there was a new kind of strength in the gravity\nof her face, and her colour still gave her that look of deep-seated\nhealth and ardour. Still? Why, it flashed across me that though so much\nhad happened in her life and in mine, she was barely twenty-four years\nold.\n\nAntonia stuck her fork in the ground, and instinctively we walked toward\nthat unploughed patch at the crossing of the roads as the fittest place\nto talk to each other. We sat down outside the sagging wire fence that\nshut Mr. Shimerda’s plot off from the rest of the world. The tall red\ngrass had never been cut there. It had died down in winter and come up\nagain in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical\ngarden-grass. I found myself telling her everything: why I had decided\nto study law and to go into the law office of one of my mother’s\nrelatives in New York City; about Gaston Cleric’s death from pneumonia\nlast winter, and the difference it had made in my life. She wanted to\nknow about my friends, and my way of living, and my dearest hopes.\n\n‘Of course it means you are going away from us for good,’ she said with\na sigh. ‘But that don’t mean I’ll lose you. Look at my papa here; he’s\nbeen dead all these years, and yet he is more real to me than almost\nanybody else. He never goes out of my life. I talk to him and consult\nhim all the time. The older I grow, the better I know him and the more I\nunderstand him.’\n\nShe asked me whether I had learned to like big cities. ‘I’d always be\nmiserable in a city. I’d die of lonesomeness. I like to be where I know\nevery stack and tree, and where all the ground is friendly. I want to\nlive and die here. Father Kelly says everybody’s put into this world\nfor something, and I know what I’ve got to do. I’m going to see that my\nlittle girl has a better chance than ever I had. I’m going to take care\nof that girl, Jim.’\n\nI told her I knew she would. ‘Do you know, Antonia, since I’ve been\naway, I think of you more often than of anyone else in this part of the\nworld. I’d have liked to have you for a sweetheart, or a wife, or my\nmother or my sister--anything that a woman can be to a man. The idea of\nyou is a part of my mind; you influence my likes and dislikes, all my\ntastes, hundreds of times when I don’t realize it. You really are a part\nof me.’\n\nShe turned her bright, believing eyes to me, and the tears came up in\nthem slowly, ‘How can it be like that, when you know so many people, and\nwhen I’ve disappointed you so? Ain’t it wonderful, Jim, how much people\ncan mean to each other? I’m so glad we had each other when we were\nlittle. I can’t wait till my little girl’s old enough to tell her about\nall the things we used to do. You’ll always remember me when you think\nabout old times, won’t you? And I guess everybody thinks about old\ntimes, even the happiest people.’\n\nAs we walked homeward across the fields, the sun dropped and lay like a\ngreat golden globe in the low west. While it hung there, the moon rose\nin the east, as big as a cart-wheel, pale silver and streaked with rose\ncolour, thin as a bubble or a ghost-moon. For five, perhaps ten minutes,\nthe two luminaries confronted each other across the level land, resting\non opposite edges of the world.\n\nIn that singular light every little tree and shock of wheat, every\nsunflower stalk and clump of snow-on-the-mountain, drew itself up high\nand pointed; the very clods and furrows in the fields seemed to stand up\nsharply. I felt the old pull of the earth, the solemn magic that comes\nout of those fields at nightfall. I wished I could be a little boy\nagain, and that my way could end there.\n\nWe reached the edge of the field, where our ways parted. I took her\nhands and held them against my breast, feeling once more how strong and\nwarm and good they were, those brown hands, and remembering how many\nkind things they had done for me. I held them now a long while, over my\nheart. About us it was growing darker and darker, and I had to look hard\nto see her face, which I meant always to carry with me; the closest,\nrealest face, under all the shadows of women’s faces, at the very bottom\nof my memory.\n\n‘I’ll come back,’ I said earnestly, through the soft, intrusive\ndarkness.\n\n\n‘Perhaps you will’--I felt rather than saw her smile. ‘But even if you\ndon’t, you’re here, like my father. So I won’t be lonesome.’\n\nAs I went back alone over that familiar road, I could almost believe\nthat a boy and girl ran along beside me, as our shadows used to do,\nlaughing and whispering to each other in the grass.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK V. Cuzak’s Boys\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nI TOLD ANTONIA I would come back, but life intervened, and it was twenty\nyears before I kept my promise. I heard of her from time to time; that\nshe married, very soon after I last saw her, a young Bohemian, a cousin\nof Anton Jelinek; that they were poor, and had a large family. Once when\nI was abroad I went into Bohemia, and from Prague I sent Antonia some\nphotographs of her native village. Months afterward came a letter from\nher, telling me the names and ages of her many children, but little\nelse; signed, ‘Your old friend, Antonia Cuzak.’ When I met Tiny\nSoderball in Salt Lake, she told me that Antonia had not ‘done very\nwell’; that her husband was not a man of much force, and she had had\na hard life. Perhaps it was cowardice that kept me away so long. My\nbusiness took me West several times every year, and it was always in\nthe back of my mind that I would stop in Nebraska some day and go to see\nAntonia. But I kept putting it off until the next trip. I did not want\nto find her aged and broken; I really dreaded it. In the course of\ntwenty crowded years one parts with many illusions. I did not wish to\nlose the early ones. Some memories are realities, and are better than\nanything that can ever happen to one again.\n\n\nI owe it to Lena Lingard that I went to see Antonia at last. I was in\nSan Francisco two summers ago when both Lena and Tiny Soderball were\nin town. Tiny lives in a house of her own, and Lena’s shop is in an\napartment house just around the corner. It interested me, after so\nmany years, to see the two women together. Tiny audits Lena’s accounts\noccasionally, and invests her money for her; and Lena, apparently, takes\ncare that Tiny doesn’t grow too miserly. ‘If there’s anything I can’t\nstand,’ she said to me in Tiny’s presence, ‘it’s a shabby rich woman.’\nTiny smiled grimly and assured me that Lena would never be either shabby\nor rich. ‘And I don’t want to be,’ the other agreed complacently.\n\nLena gave me a cheerful account of Antonia and urged me to make her a\nvisit.\n\n‘You really ought to go, Jim. It would be such a satisfaction to her.\nNever mind what Tiny says. There’s nothing the matter with Cuzak. You’d\nlike him. He isn’t a hustler, but a rough man would never have suited\nTony. Tony has nice children--ten or eleven of them by this time, I\nguess. I shouldn’t care for a family of that size myself, but somehow\nit’s just right for Tony. She’d love to show them to you.’\n\nOn my way East I broke my journey at Hastings, in Nebraska, and set off\nwith an open buggy and a fairly good livery team to find the Cuzak farm.\nAt a little past midday, I knew I must be nearing my destination. Set\nback on a swell of land at my right, I saw a wide farm-house, with a red\nbarn and an ash grove, and cattle-yards in front that sloped down to the\nhighroad. I drew up my horses and was wondering whether I should drive\nin here, when I heard low voices. Ahead of me, in a plum thicket beside\nthe road, I saw two boys bending over a dead dog. The little one, not\nmore than four or five, was on his knees, his hands folded, and his\nclose-clipped, bare head drooping forward in deep dejection. The other\nstood beside him, a hand on his shoulder, and was comforting him in\na language I had not heard for a long while. When I stopped my horses\nopposite them, the older boy took his brother by the hand and came\ntoward me. He, too, looked grave. This was evidently a sad afternoon for\nthem.\n\n\n‘Are you Mrs. Cuzak’s boys?’ I asked.\n\nThe younger one did not look up; he was submerged in his own feelings,\nbut his brother met me with intelligent grey eyes. ‘Yes, sir.’\n\n‘Does she live up there on the hill? I am going to see her. Get in and\nride up with me.’\n\nHe glanced at his reluctant little brother. ‘I guess we’d better walk.\nBut we’ll open the gate for you.’\n\nI drove along the side-road and they followed slowly behind. When I\npulled up at the windmill, another boy, barefooted and curly-headed, ran\nout of the barn to tie my team for me. He was a handsome one, this chap,\nfair-skinned and freckled, with red cheeks and a ruddy pelt as thick as\na lamb’s wool, growing down on his neck in little tufts. He tied my team\nwith two flourishes of his hands, and nodded when I asked him if his\nmother was at home. As he glanced at me, his face dimpled with a seizure\nof irrelevant merriment, and he shot up the windmill tower with a\nlightness that struck me as disdainful. I knew he was peering down at me\nas I walked toward the house.\n\nDucks and geese ran quacking across my path. White cats were sunning\nthemselves among yellow pumpkins on the porch steps. I looked through\nthe wire screen into a big, light kitchen with a white floor. I saw a\nlong table, rows of wooden chairs against the wall, and a shining range\nin one corner. Two girls were washing dishes at the sink, laughing\nand chattering, and a little one, in a short pinafore, sat on a stool\nplaying with a rag baby. When I asked for their mother, one of the girls\ndropped her towel, ran across the floor with noiseless bare feet, and\ndisappeared. The older one, who wore shoes and stockings, came to the\ndoor to admit me. She was a buxom girl with dark hair and eyes, calm and\nself-possessed.\n\n‘Won’t you come in? Mother will be here in a minute.’\n\nBefore I could sit down in the chair she offered me, the miracle\nhappened; one of those quiet moments that clutch the heart, and take\nmore courage than the noisy, excited passages in life. Antonia came in\nand stood before me; a stalwart, brown woman, flat-chested, her curly\nbrown hair a little grizzled. It was a shock, of course. It always is,\nto meet people after long years, especially if they have lived as much\nand as hard as this woman had. We stood looking at each other. The eyes\nthat peered anxiously at me were--simply Antonia’s eyes. I had seen no\nothers like them since I looked into them last, though I had looked at\nso many thousands of human faces. As I confronted her, the changes grew\nless apparent to me, her identity stronger. She was there, in the full\nvigour of her personality, battered but not diminished, looking at me,\nspeaking to me in the husky, breathy voice I remembered so well.\n\n‘My husband’s not at home, sir. Can I do anything?’\n\n‘Don’t you remember me, Antonia? Have I changed so much?’\n\nShe frowned into the slanting sunlight that made her brown hair look\nredder than it was. Suddenly her eyes widened, her whole face seemed to\ngrow broader. She caught her breath and put out two hard-worked hands.\n\n‘Why, it’s Jim! Anna, Yulka, it’s Jim Burden!’ She had no sooner caught\nmy hands than she looked alarmed. ‘What’s happened? Is anybody dead?’\n\nI patted her arm.\n\n‘No. I didn’t come to a funeral this time. I got off the train at\nHastings and drove down to see you and your family.’\n\nShe dropped my hand and began rushing about. ‘Anton, Yulka, Nina, where\nare you all? Run, Anna, and hunt for the boys. They’re off looking for\nthat dog, somewhere. And call Leo. Where is that Leo!’ She pulled them\nout of corners and came bringing them like a mother cat bringing in her\nkittens. ‘You don’t have to go right off, Jim? My oldest boy’s not here.\nHe’s gone with papa to the street fair at Wilber. I won’t let you go!\nYou’ve got to stay and see Rudolph and our papa.’ She looked at me\nimploringly, panting with excitement.\n\nWhile I reassured her and told her there would be plenty of time,\nthe barefooted boys from outside were slipping into the kitchen and\ngathering about her.\n\n‘Now, tell me their names, and how old they are.’\n\nAs she told them off in turn, she made several mistakes about ages, and\nthey roared with laughter. When she came to my light-footed friend of\nthe windmill, she said, ‘This is Leo, and he’s old enough to be better\nthan he is.’\n\nHe ran up to her and butted her playfully with his curly head, like\na little ram, but his voice was quite desperate. ‘You’ve forgot! You\nalways forget mine. It’s mean! Please tell him, mother!’ He clenched his\nfists in vexation and looked up at her impetuously.\n\nShe wound her forefinger in his yellow fleece and pulled it, watching\nhim. ‘Well, how old are you?’\n\n‘I’m twelve,’ he panted, looking not at me but at her; ‘I’m twelve years\nold, and I was born on Easter Day!’\n\nShe nodded to me. ‘It’s true. He was an Easter baby.’\n\nThe children all looked at me, as if they expected me to exhibit\nastonishment or delight at this information. Clearly, they were proud\nof each other, and of being so many. When they had all been introduced,\nAnna, the eldest daughter, who had met me at the door, scattered\nthem gently, and came bringing a white apron which she tied round her\nmother’s waist.\n\n‘Now, mother, sit down and talk to Mr. Burden. We’ll finish the dishes\nquietly and not disturb you.’\n\nAntonia looked about, quite distracted. ‘Yes, child, but why don’t\nwe take him into the parlour, now that we’ve got a nice parlour for\ncompany?’\n\nThe daughter laughed indulgently, and took my hat from me. ‘Well, you’re\nhere, now, mother, and if you talk here, Yulka and I can listen, too.\nYou can show him the parlour after while.’ She smiled at me, and went\nback to the dishes, with her sister. The little girl with the rag doll\nfound a place on the bottom step of an enclosed back stairway, and sat\nwith her toes curled up, looking out at us expectantly.\n\n‘She’s Nina, after Nina Harling,’ Antonia explained. ‘Ain’t her eyes\nlike Nina’s? I declare, Jim, I loved you children almost as much as I\nlove my own. These children know all about you and Charley and Sally,\nlike as if they’d grown up with you. I can’t think of what I want to\nsay, you’ve got me so stirred up. And then, I’ve forgot my English so.\nI don’t often talk it any more. I tell the children I used to speak\nreal well.’ She said they always spoke Bohemian at home. The little\nones could not speak English at all--didn’t learn it until they went to\nschool.\n\n‘I can’t believe it’s you, sitting here, in my own kitchen. You wouldn’t\nhave known me, would you, Jim? You’ve kept so young, yourself. But it’s\neasier for a man. I can’t see how my Anton looks any older than the day\nI married him. His teeth have kept so nice. I haven’t got many left.\nBut I feel just as young as I used to, and I can do as much work. Oh,\nwe don’t have to work so hard now! We’ve got plenty to help us, papa and\nme. And how many have you got, Jim?’\n\nWhen I told her I had no children, she seemed embarrassed. ‘Oh, ain’t\nthat too bad! Maybe you could take one of my bad ones, now? That Leo;\nhe’s the worst of all.’ She leaned toward me with a smile. ‘And I love\nhim the best,’ she whispered.\n\n‘Mother!’ the two girls murmured reproachfully from the dishes.\n\nAntonia threw up her head and laughed. ‘I can’t help it. You know I do.\nMaybe it’s because he came on Easter Day, I don’t know. And he’s never\nout of mischief one minute!’\n\nI was thinking, as I watched her, how little it mattered--about her\nteeth, for instance. I know so many women who have kept all the things\nthat she had lost, but whose inner glow has faded. Whatever else was\ngone, Antonia had not lost the fire of life. Her skin, so brown and\nhardened, had not that look of flabbiness, as if the sap beneath it had\nbeen secretly drawn away.\n\nWhile we were talking, the little boy whom they called Jan came in and\nsat down on the step beside Nina, under the hood of the stairway. He\nwore a funny long gingham apron, like a smock, over his trousers, and\nhis hair was clipped so short that his head looked white and naked. He\nwatched us out of his big, sorrowful grey eyes.\n\n‘He wants to tell you about the dog, mother. They found it dead,’ Anna\nsaid, as she passed us on her way to the cupboard.\n\nAntonia beckoned the boy to her. He stood by her chair, leaning his\nelbows on her knees and twisting her apron strings in his slender\nfingers, while he told her his story softly in Bohemian, and the tears\nbrimmed over and hung on his long lashes. His mother listened, spoke\nsoothingly to him and in a whisper promised him something that made him\ngive her a quick, teary smile. He slipped away and whispered his secret\nto Nina, sitting close to her and talking behind his hand.\n\nWhen Anna finished her work and had washed her hands, she came and stood\nbehind her mother’s chair. ‘Why don’t we show Mr. Burden our new fruit\ncave?’ she asked.\n\nWe started off across the yard with the children at our heels. The boys\nwere standing by the windmill, talking about the dog; some of them ran\nahead to open the cellar door. When we descended, they all came down\nafter us, and seemed quite as proud of the cave as the girls were.\n\nAmbrosch, the thoughtful-looking one who had directed me down by the\nplum bushes, called my attention to the stout brick walls and the cement\nfloor. ‘Yes, it is a good way from the house,’ he admitted. ‘But, you\nsee, in winter there are nearly always some of us around to come out and\nget things.’\n\nAnna and Yulka showed me three small barrels; one full of dill pickles,\none full of chopped pickles, and one full of pickled watermelon rinds.\n\n‘You wouldn’t believe, Jim, what it takes to feed them all!’ their\nmother exclaimed. ‘You ought to see the bread we bake on Wednesdays and\nSaturdays! It’s no wonder their poor papa can’t get rich, he has to buy\nso much sugar for us to preserve with. We have our own wheat ground for\nflour--but then there’s that much less to sell.’\n\nNina and Jan, and a little girl named Lucie, kept shyly pointing out to\nme the shelves of glass jars. They said nothing, but, glancing at me,\ntraced on the glass with their finger-tips the outline of the cherries\nand strawberries and crabapples within, trying by a blissful expression\nof countenance to give me some idea of their deliciousness.\n\n‘Show him the spiced plums, mother. Americans don’t have those,’ said\none of the older boys. ‘Mother uses them to make kolaches,’ he added.\n\nLeo, in a low voice, tossed off some scornful remark in Bohemian.\n\nI turned to him. ‘You think I don’t know what kolaches are, eh? You’re\nmistaken, young man. I’ve eaten your mother’s kolaches long before that\nEaster Day when you were born.’\n\n‘Always too fresh, Leo,’ Ambrosch remarked with a shrug.\n\nLeo dived behind his mother and grinned out at me.\n\nWe turned to leave the cave; Antonia and I went up the stairs first,\nand the children waited. We were standing outside talking, when they all\ncame running up the steps together, big and little, tow heads and gold\nheads and brown, and flashing little naked legs; a veritable explosion\nof life out of the dark cave into the sunlight. It made me dizzy for a\nmoment.\n\nThe boys escorted us to the front of the house, which I hadn’t yet seen;\nin farm-houses, somehow, life comes and goes by the back door. The\nroof was so steep that the eaves were not much above the forest of tall\nhollyhocks, now brown and in seed. Through July, Antonia said, the\nhouse was buried in them; the Bohemians, I remembered, always planted\nhollyhocks. The front yard was enclosed by a thorny locust hedge, and\nat the gate grew two silvery, moth-like trees of the mimosa family. From\nhere one looked down over the cattle-yards, with their two long ponds,\nand over a wide stretch of stubble which they told me was a ryefield in\nsummer.\n\nAt some distance behind the house were an ash grove and two orchards: a\ncherry orchard, with gooseberry and currant bushes between the rows,\nand an apple orchard, sheltered by a high hedge from the hot winds. The\nolder children turned back when we reached the hedge, but Jan and Nina\nand Lucie crept through it by a hole known only to themselves and hid\nunder the low-branching mulberry bushes.\n\nAs we walked through the apple orchard, grown up in tall bluegrass,\nAntonia kept stopping to tell me about one tree and another. ‘I love\nthem as if they were people,’ she said, rubbing her hand over the bark.\n‘There wasn’t a tree here when we first came. We planted every one, and\nused to carry water for them, too--after we’d been working in the fields\nall day. Anton, he was a city man, and he used to get discouraged. But I\ncouldn’t feel so tired that I wouldn’t fret about these trees when there\nwas a dry time. They were on my mind like children. Many a night after\nhe was asleep I’ve got up and come out and carried water to the poor\nthings. And now, you see, we have the good of them. My man worked in the\norange groves in Florida, and he knows all about grafting. There ain’t\none of our neighbours has an orchard that bears like ours.’\n\nIn the middle of the orchard we came upon a grape arbour, with seats\nbuilt along the sides and a warped plank table. The three children\nwere waiting for us there. They looked up at me bashfully and made some\nrequest of their mother.\n\n‘They want me to tell you how the teacher has the school picnic here\nevery year. These don’t go to school yet, so they think it’s all like\nthe picnic.’\n\nAfter I had admired the arbour sufficiently, the youngsters ran away\nto an open place where there was a rough jungle of French pinks, and\nsquatted down among them, crawling about and measuring with a string.\n\n‘Jan wants to bury his dog there,’ Antonia explained. ‘I had to tell him\nhe could. He’s kind of like Nina Harling; you remember how hard she used\nto take little things? He has funny notions, like her.’\n\nWe sat down and watched them. Antonia leaned her elbows on the table.\nThere was the deepest peace in that orchard. It was surrounded by a\ntriple enclosure; the wire fence, then the hedge of thorny locusts, then\nthe mulberry hedge which kept out the hot winds of summer and held fast\nto the protecting snows of winter. The hedges were so tall that we could\nsee nothing but the blue sky above them, neither the barn roof nor the\nwindmill. The afternoon sun poured down on us through the drying grape\nleaves. The orchard seemed full of sun, like a cup, and we could smell\nthe ripe apples on the trees. The crabs hung on the branches as thick as\nbeads on a string, purple-red, with a thin silvery glaze over them.\nSome hens and ducks had crept through the hedge and were pecking at\nthe fallen apples. The drakes were handsome fellows, with pinkish grey\nbodies, their heads and necks covered with iridescent green feathers\nwhich grew close and full, changing to blue like a peacock’s neck.\nAntonia said they always reminded her of soldiers--some uniform she had\nseen in the old country, when she was a child.\n\n‘Are there any quail left now?’ I asked. I reminded her how she used to\ngo hunting with me the last summer before we moved to town. ‘You weren’t\na bad shot, Tony. Do you remember how you used to want to run away and\ngo for ducks with Charley Harling and me?’\n\n‘I know, but I’m afraid to look at a gun now.’ She picked up one of the\ndrakes and ruffled his green capote with her fingers. ‘Ever since I’ve\nhad children, I don’t like to kill anything. It makes me kind of faint\nto wring an old goose’s neck. Ain’t that strange, Jim?’\n\n‘I don’t know. The young Queen of Italy said the same thing once, to a\nfriend of mine. She used to be a great huntswoman, but now she feels as\nyou do, and only shoots clay pigeons.’\n\n‘Then I’m sure she’s a good mother,’ Antonia said warmly.\n\nShe told me how she and her husband had come out to this new country\nwhen the farm-land was cheap and could be had on easy payments. The\nfirst ten years were a hard struggle. Her husband knew very little about\nfarming and often grew discouraged. ‘We’d never have got through if I\nhadn’t been so strong. I’ve always had good health, thank God, and I\nwas able to help him in the fields until right up to the time before\nmy babies came. Our children were good about taking care of each other.\nMartha, the one you saw when she was a baby, was such a help to me, and\nshe trained Anna to be just like her. My Martha’s married now, and has a\nbaby of her own. Think of that, Jim!\n\n‘No, I never got down-hearted. Anton’s a good man, and I loved my\nchildren and always believed they would turn out well. I belong on a\nfarm. I’m never lonesome here like I used to be in town. You remember\nwhat sad spells I used to have, when I didn’t know what was the matter\nwith me? I’ve never had them out here. And I don’t mind work a bit, if I\ndon’t have to put up with sadness.’ She leaned her chin on her hand and\nlooked down through the orchard, where the sunlight was growing more and\nmore golden.\n\n\n‘You ought never to have gone to town, Tony,’ I said, wondering at her.\n\nShe turned to me eagerly.\n\n‘Oh, I’m glad I went! I’d never have known anything about cooking or\nhousekeeping if I hadn’t. I learned nice ways at the Harlings’, and I’ve\nbeen able to bring my children up so much better. Don’t you think they\nare pretty well-behaved for country children? If it hadn’t been for\nwhat Mrs. Harling taught me, I expect I’d have brought them up like wild\nrabbits. No, I’m glad I had a chance to learn; but I’m thankful none of\nmy daughters will ever have to work out. The trouble with me was, Jim, I\nnever could believe harm of anybody I loved.’\n\nWhile we were talking, Antonia assured me that she could keep me for the\nnight. ‘We’ve plenty of room. Two of the boys sleep in the haymow till\ncold weather comes, but there’s no need for it. Leo always begs to sleep\nthere, and Ambrosch goes along to look after him.’\n\nI told her I would like to sleep in the haymow, with the boys.\n\n‘You can do just as you want to. The chest is full of clean blankets,\nput away for winter. Now I must go, or my girls will be doing all the\nwork, and I want to cook your supper myself.’\n\nAs we went toward the house, we met Ambrosch and Anton, starting off\nwith their milking-pails to hunt the cows. I joined them, and Leo\naccompanied us at some distance, running ahead and starting up at us\nout of clumps of ironweed, calling, ‘I’m a jack rabbit,’ or, ‘I’m a big\nbull-snake.’\n\nI walked between the two older boys--straight, well-made fellows, with\ngood heads and clear eyes. They talked about their school and the new\nteacher, told me about the crops and the harvest, and how many steers\nthey would feed that winter. They were easy and confidential with me,\nas if I were an old friend of the family--and not too old. I felt like\na boy in their company, and all manner of forgotten interests revived in\nme. It seemed, after all, so natural to be walking along a barbed-wire\nfence beside the sunset, toward a red pond, and to see my shadow moving\nalong at my right, over the close-cropped grass.\n\n‘Has mother shown you the pictures you sent her from the old country?’\nAmbrosch asked. ‘We’ve had them framed and they’re hung up in the\nparlour. She was so glad to get them. I don’t believe I ever saw her\nso pleased about anything.’ There was a note of simple gratitude in his\nvoice that made me wish I had given more occasion for it.\n\nI put my hand on his shoulder. ‘Your mother, you know, was very much\nloved by all of us. She was a beautiful girl.’\n\n‘Oh, we know!’ They both spoke together; seemed a little surprised\nthat I should think it necessary to mention this. ‘Everybody liked\nher, didn’t they? The Harlings and your grandmother, and all the town\npeople.’\n\n‘Sometimes,’ I ventured, ‘it doesn’t occur to boys that their mother was\never young and pretty.’\n\n‘Oh, we know!’ they said again, warmly. ‘She’s not very old now,’\nAmbrosch added. ‘Not much older than you.’\n\n‘Well,’ I said, ‘if you weren’t nice to her, I think I’d take a club\nand go for the whole lot of you. I couldn’t stand it if you boys were\ninconsiderate, or thought of her as if she were just somebody who looked\nafter you. You see I was very much in love with your mother once, and I\nknow there’s nobody like her.’\n\nThe boys laughed and seemed pleased and embarrassed.\n\n‘She never told us that,’ said Anton. ‘But she’s always talked lots\nabout you, and about what good times you used to have. She has a picture\nof you that she cut out of the Chicago paper once, and Leo says he\nrecognized you when you drove up to the windmill. You can’t tell about\nLeo, though; sometimes he likes to be smart.’\n\nWe brought the cows home to the corner nearest the barn, and the boys\nmilked them while night came on. Everything was as it should be: the\nstrong smell of sunflowers and ironweed in the dew, the clear blue and\ngold of the sky, the evening star, the purr of the milk into the pails,\nthe grunts and squeals of the pigs fighting over their supper. I began\nto feel the loneliness of the farm-boy at evening, when the chores seem\neverlastingly the same, and the world so far away.\n\nWhat a tableful we were at supper: two long rows of restless heads in\nthe lamplight, and so many eyes fastened excitedly upon Antonia as she\nsat at the head of the table, filling the plates and starting the dishes\non their way. The children were seated according to a system; a little\none next an older one, who was to watch over his behaviour and to see\nthat he got his food. Anna and Yulka left their chairs from time to time\nto bring fresh plates of kolaches and pitchers of milk.\n\nAfter supper we went into the parlour, so that Yulka and Leo could play\nfor me. Antonia went first, carrying the lamp. There were not nearly\nchairs enough to go round, so the younger children sat down on the\nbare floor. Little Lucie whispered to me that they were going to have\na parlour carpet if they got ninety cents for their wheat. Leo, with\na good deal of fussing, got out his violin. It was old Mr. Shimerda’s\ninstrument, which Antonia had always kept, and it was too big for him.\nBut he played very well for a self-taught boy. Poor Yulka’s efforts were\nnot so successful. While they were playing, little Nina got up from her\ncorner, came out into the middle of the floor, and began to do a pretty\nlittle dance on the boards with her bare feet. No one paid the least\nattention to her, and when she was through she stole back and sat down\nby her brother.\n\nAntonia spoke to Leo in Bohemian. He frowned and wrinkled up his face.\nHe seemed to be trying to pout, but his attempt only brought out dimples\nin unusual places. After twisting and screwing the keys, he played some\nBohemian airs, without the organ to hold him back, and that went better.\nThe boy was so restless that I had not had a chance to look at his\nface before. My first impression was right; he really was faun-like. He\nhadn’t much head behind his ears, and his tawny fleece grew down thick\nto the back of his neck. His eyes were not frank and wide apart like\nthose of the other boys, but were deep-set, gold-green in colour, and\nseemed sensitive to the light. His mother said he got hurt oftener than\nall the others put together. He was always trying to ride the colts\nbefore they were broken, teasing the turkey gobbler, seeing just how\nmuch red the bull would stand for, or how sharp the new axe was.\n\nAfter the concert was over, Antonia brought out a big boxful of\nphotographs: she and Anton in their wedding clothes, holding hands; her\nbrother Ambrosch and his very fat wife, who had a farm of her own, and\nwho bossed her husband, I was delighted to hear; the three Bohemian\nMarys and their large families.\n\n‘You wouldn’t believe how steady those girls have turned out,’ Antonia\nremarked. ‘Mary Svoboda’s the best butter-maker in all this country, and\na fine manager. Her children will have a grand chance.’\n\nAs Antonia turned over the pictures the young Cuzaks stood behind her\nchair, looking over her shoulder with interested faces. Nina and Jan,\nafter trying to see round the taller ones, quietly brought a chair,\nclimbed up on it, and stood close together, looking. The little boy\nforgot his shyness and grinned delightedly when familiar faces came into\nview. In the group about Antonia I was conscious of a kind of physical\nharmony. They leaned this way and that, and were not afraid to touch\neach other. They contemplated the photographs with pleased recognition;\nlooked at some admiringly, as if these characters in their mother’s\ngirlhood had been remarkable people. The little children, who could\nnot speak English, murmured comments to each other in their rich old\nlanguage.\n\nAntonia held out a photograph of Lena that had come from San Francisco\nlast Christmas. ‘Does she still look like that? She hasn’t been home\nfor six years now.’ Yes, it was exactly like Lena, I told her; a comely\nwoman, a trifle too plump, in a hat a trifle too large, but with the\nold lazy eyes, and the old dimpled ingenuousness still lurking at the\ncorners of her mouth.\n\nThere was a picture of Frances Harling in a befrogged riding costume\nthat I remembered well. ‘Isn’t she fine!’ the girls murmured. They all\nassented. One could see that Frances had come down as a heroine in the\nfamily legend. Only Leo was unmoved.\n\n‘And there’s Mr. Harling, in his grand fur coat. He was awfully rich,\nwasn’t he, mother?’\n\n‘He wasn’t any Rockefeller,’ put in Master Leo, in a very low tone,\nwhich reminded me of the way in which Mrs. Shimerda had once said that\nmy grandfather ‘wasn’t Jesus.’ His habitual scepticism was like a direct\ninheritance from that old woman.\n\n‘None of your smart speeches,’ said Ambrosch severely.\n\nLeo poked out a supple red tongue at him, but a moment later broke\ninto a giggle at a tintype of two men, uncomfortably seated, with an\nawkward-looking boy in baggy clothes standing between them: Jake and\nOtto and I! We had it taken, I remembered, when we went to Black Hawk on\nthe first Fourth of July I spent in Nebraska. I was glad to see Jake’s\ngrin again, and Otto’s ferocious moustaches. The young Cuzaks knew all\nabout them. ‘He made grandfather’s coffin, didn’t he?’ Anton asked.\n\n‘Wasn’t they good fellows, Jim?’ Antonia’s eyes filled. ‘To this day\nI’m ashamed because I quarrelled with Jake that way. I was saucy and\nimpertinent to him, Leo, like you are with people sometimes, and I wish\nsomebody had made me behave.’\n\n‘We aren’t through with you, yet,’ they warned me. They produced a\nphotograph taken just before I went away to college: a tall youth in\nstriped trousers and a straw hat, trying to look easy and jaunty.\n\n‘Tell us, Mr. Burden,’ said Charley, ‘about the rattler you killed\nat the dog-town. How long was he? Sometimes mother says six feet and\nsometimes she says five.’\n\nThese children seemed to be upon very much the same terms with Antonia\nas the Harling children had been so many years before. They seemed\nto feel the same pride in her, and to look to her for stories and\nentertainment as we used to do.\n\nIt was eleven o’clock when I at last took my bag and some blankets and\nstarted for the barn with the boys. Their mother came to the door with\nus, and we tarried for a moment to look out at the white slope of the\ncorral and the two ponds asleep in the moonlight, and the long sweep of\nthe pasture under the star-sprinkled sky.\n\nThe boys told me to choose my own place in the haymow, and I lay down\nbefore a big window, left open in warm weather, that looked out into the\nstars. Ambrosch and Leo cuddled up in a hay-cave, back under the eaves,\nand lay giggling and whispering. They tickled each other and tossed and\ntumbled in the hay; and then, all at once, as if they had been shot,\nthey were still. There was hardly a minute between giggles and bland\nslumber.\n\n\nI lay awake for a long while, until the slow-moving moon passed my\nwindow on its way up the heavens. I was thinking about Antonia and her\nchildren; about Anna’s solicitude for her, Ambrosch’s grave affection,\nLeo’s jealous, animal little love. That moment, when they all came\ntumbling out of the cave into the light, was a sight any man might have\ncome far to see. Antonia had always been one to leave images in the mind\nthat did not fade--that grew stronger with time. In my memory there\nwas a succession of such pictures, fixed there like the old woodcuts of\none’s first primer: Antonia kicking her bare legs against the sides\nof my pony when we came home in triumph with our snake; Antonia in\nher black shawl and fur cap, as she stood by her father’s grave in\nthe snowstorm; Antonia coming in with her work-team along the evening\nsky-line. She lent herself to immemorial human attitudes which we\nrecognize by instinct as universal and true. I had not been mistaken.\nShe was a battered woman now, not a lovely girl; but she still had that\nsomething which fires the imagination, could still stop one’s breath\nfor a moment by a look or gesture that somehow revealed the meaning in\ncommon things. She had only to stand in the orchard, to put her hand\non a little crab tree and look up at the apples, to make you feel the\ngoodness of planting and tending and harvesting at last. All the strong\nthings of her heart came out in her body, that had been so tireless in\nserving generous emotions.\n\nIt was no wonder that her sons stood tall and straight. She was a rich\nmine of life, like the founders of early races.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nWHEN I AWOKE IN THE morning, long bands of sunshine were coming in at\nthe window and reaching back under the eaves where the two boys lay.\nLeo was wide awake and was tickling his brother’s leg with a dried\ncone-flower he had pulled out of the hay. Ambrosch kicked at him and\nturned over. I closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep. Leo lay on\nhis back, elevated one foot, and began exercising his toes. He picked up\ndried flowers with his toes and brandished them in the belt of sunlight.\nAfter he had amused himself thus for some time, he rose on one elbow and\nbegan to look at me, cautiously, then critically, blinking his eyes in\nthe light. His expression was droll; it dismissed me lightly. ‘This old\nfellow is no different from other people. He doesn’t know my secret.’\nHe seemed conscious of possessing a keener power of enjoyment than\nother people; his quick recognitions made him frantically impatient of\ndeliberate judgments. He always knew what he wanted without thinking.\n\nAfter dressing in the hay, I washed my face in cold water at the\nwindmill. Breakfast was ready when I entered the kitchen, and Yulka was\nbaking griddle-cakes. The three older boys set off for the fields early.\nLeo and Yulka were to drive to town to meet their father, who would\nreturn from Wilber on the noon train.\n\n‘We’ll only have a lunch at noon,’ Antonia said, and cook the geese for\nsupper, when our papa will be here. I wish my Martha could come down to\nsee you. They have a Ford car now, and she don’t seem so far away from\nme as she used to. But her husband’s crazy about his farm and about\nhaving everything just right, and they almost never get away except on\nSundays. He’s a handsome boy, and he’ll be rich some day. Everything\nhe takes hold of turns out well. When they bring that baby in here, and\nunwrap him, he looks like a little prince; Martha takes care of him so\nbeautiful. I’m reconciled to her being away from me now, but at first I\ncried like I was putting her into her coffin.’\n\nWe were alone in the kitchen, except for Anna, who was pouring cream\ninto the churn. She looked up at me. ‘Yes, she did. We were just ashamed\nof mother. She went round crying, when Martha was so happy, and the rest\nof us were all glad. Joe certainly was patient with you, mother.’\n\nAntonia nodded and smiled at herself. ‘I know it was silly, but I\ncouldn’t help it. I wanted her right here. She’d never been away from me\na night since she was born. If Anton had made trouble about her when she\nwas a baby, or wanted me to leave her with my mother, I wouldn’t have\nmarried him. I couldn’t. But he always loved her like she was his own.’\n\n‘I didn’t even know Martha wasn’t my full sister until after she was\nengaged to Joe,’ Anna told me.\n\nToward the middle of the afternoon, the wagon drove in, with the father\nand the eldest son. I was smoking in the orchard, and as I went out to\nmeet them, Antonia came running down from the house and hugged the two\nmen as if they had been away for months.\n\n‘Papa,’ interested me, from my first glimpse of him. He was shorter than\nhis older sons; a crumpled little man, with run-over boot-heels, and he\ncarried one shoulder higher than the other. But he moved very quickly,\nand there was an air of jaunty liveliness about him. He had a strong,\nruddy colour, thick black hair, a little grizzled, a curly moustache,\nand red lips. His smile showed the strong teeth of which his wife was so\nproud, and as he saw me his lively, quizzical eyes told me that he knew\nall about me. He looked like a humorous philosopher who had hitched up\none shoulder under the burdens of life, and gone on his way having a\ngood time when he could. He advanced to meet me and gave me a hard hand,\nburned red on the back and heavily coated with hair. He wore his Sunday\nclothes, very thick and hot for the weather, an unstarched white shirt,\nand a blue necktie with big white dots, like a little boy’s, tied in\na flowing bow. Cuzak began at once to talk about his holiday--from\npoliteness he spoke in English.\n\n‘Mama, I wish you had see the lady dance on the slack-wire in the street\nat night. They throw a bright light on her and she float through the air\nsomething beautiful, like a bird! They have a dancing bear, like in the\nold country, and two-three merry-go-around, and people in balloons, and\nwhat you call the big wheel, Rudolph?’\n\n‘A Ferris wheel,’ Rudolph entered the conversation in a deep baritone\nvoice. He was six foot two, and had a chest like a young blacksmith. ‘We\nwent to the big dance in the hall behind the saloon last night, mother,\nand I danced with all the girls, and so did father. I never saw so many\npretty girls. It was a Bohunk crowd, for sure. We didn’t hear a word of\nEnglish on the street, except from the show people, did we, papa?’\n\nCuzak nodded. ‘And very many send word to you, Antonia. You will\nexcuse’--turning to me--‘if I tell her.’ While we walked toward the\nhouse he related incidents and delivered messages in the tongue he spoke\nfluently, and I dropped a little behind, curious to know what their\nrelations had become--or remained. The two seemed to be on terms of easy\nfriendliness, touched with humour. Clearly, she was the impulse, and\nhe the corrective. As they went up the hill he kept glancing at her\nsidewise, to see whether she got his point, or how she received it. I\nnoticed later that he always looked at people sidewise, as a work-horse\ndoes at its yokemate. Even when he sat opposite me in the kitchen,\ntalking, he would turn his head a little toward the clock or the stove\nand look at me from the side, but with frankness and good nature. This\ntrick did not suggest duplicity or secretiveness, but merely long habit,\nas with the horse.\n\nHe had brought a tintype of himself and Rudolph for Antonia’s\ncollection, and several paper bags of candy for the children. He looked\na little disappointed when his wife showed him a big box of candy I had\ngot in Denver--she hadn’t let the children touch it the night before. He\nput his candy away in the cupboard, ‘for when she rains,’ and glanced\nat the box, chuckling. ‘I guess you must have hear about how my family\nain’t so small,’ he said.\n\nCuzak sat down behind the stove and watched his womenfolk and the little\nchildren with equal amusement. He thought they were nice, and he thought\nthey were funny, evidently. He had been off dancing with the girls\nand forgetting that he was an old fellow, and now his family rather\nsurprised him; he seemed to think it a joke that all these children\nshould belong to him. As the younger ones slipped up to him in his\nretreat, he kept taking things out of his pockets; penny dolls, a wooden\nclown, a balloon pig that was inflated by a whistle. He beckoned to the\nlittle boy they called Jan, whispered to him, and presented him with a\npaper snake, gently, so as not to startle him. Looking over the boy’s\nhead he said to me, ‘This one is bashful. He gets left.’\n\nCuzak had brought home with him a roll of illustrated Bohemian papers.\nHe opened them and began to tell his wife the news, much of which seemed\nto relate to one person. I heard the name Vasakova, Vasakova, repeated\nseveral times with lively interest, and presently I asked him whether he\nwere talking about the singer, Maria Vasak.\n\n‘You know? You have heard, maybe?’ he asked incredulously. When I\nassured him that I had heard her, he pointed out her picture and told me\nthat Vasak had broken her leg, climbing in the Austrian Alps, and would\nnot be able to fill her engagements. He seemed delighted to find that I\nhad heard her sing in London and in Vienna; got out his pipe and lit\nit to enjoy our talk the better. She came from his part of Prague. His\nfather used to mend her shoes for her when she was a student. Cuzak\nquestioned me about her looks, her popularity, her voice; but he\nparticularly wanted to know whether I had noticed her tiny feet, and\nwhether I thought she had saved much money. She was extravagant, of\ncourse, but he hoped she wouldn’t squander everything, and have nothing\nleft when she was old. As a young man, working in Wienn, he had seen a\ngood many artists who were old and poor, making one glass of beer last\nall evening, and ‘it was not very nice, that.’\n\nWhen the boys came in from milking and feeding, the long table was laid,\nand two brown geese, stuffed with apples, were put down sizzling before\nAntonia. She began to carve, and Rudolph, who sat next his mother,\nstarted the plates on their way. When everybody was served, he looked\nacross the table at me.\n\n‘Have you been to Black Hawk lately, Mr. Burden? Then I wonder if you’ve\nheard about the Cutters?’\n\nNo, I had heard nothing at all about them.\n\n‘Then you must tell him, son, though it’s a terrible thing to talk about\nat supper. Now, all you children be quiet, Rudolph is going to tell\nabout the murder.’\n\n‘Hurrah! The murder!’ the children murmured, looking pleased and\ninterested.\n\nRudolph told his story in great detail, with occasional promptings from\nhis mother or father.\n\nWick Cutter and his wife had gone on living in the house that Antonia\nand I knew so well, and in the way we knew so well. They grew to be\nvery old people. He shrivelled up, Antonia said, until he looked like\na little old yellow monkey, for his beard and his fringe of hair never\nchanged colour. Mrs. Cutter remained flushed and wild-eyed as we had\nknown her, but as the years passed she became afflicted with a shaking\npalsy which made her nervous nod continuous instead of occasional. Her\nhands were so uncertain that she could no longer disfigure china, poor\nwoman! As the couple grew older, they quarrelled more and more often\nabout the ultimate disposition of their ‘property.’ A new law was passed\nin the state, securing the surviving wife a third of her husband’s\nestate under all conditions. Cutter was tormented by the fear that Mrs.\nCutter would live longer than he, and that eventually her ‘people,’ whom\nhe had always hated so violently, would inherit. Their quarrels on this\nsubject passed the boundary of the close-growing cedars, and were heard\nin the street by whoever wished to loiter and listen.\n\nOne morning, two years ago, Cutter went into the hardware store and\nbought a pistol, saying he was going to shoot a dog, and adding that\nhe ‘thought he would take a shot at an old cat while he was about\nit.’ (Here the children interrupted Rudolph’s narrative by smothered\ngiggles.)\n\nCutter went out behind the hardware store, put up a target, practised\nfor an hour or so, and then went home. At six o’clock that evening, when\nseveral men were passing the Cutter house on their way home to supper,\nthey heard a pistol shot. They paused and were looking doubtfully at\none another, when another shot came crashing through an upstairs window.\nThey ran into the house and found Wick Cutter lying on a sofa in his\nupstairs bedroom, with his throat torn open, bleeding on a roll of\nsheets he had placed beside his head.\n\n‘Walk in, gentlemen,’ he said weakly. ‘I am alive, you see, and\ncompetent. You are witnesses that I have survived my wife. You will find\nher in her own room. Please make your examination at once, so that there\nwill be no mistake.’\n\nOne of the neighbours telephoned for a doctor, while the others went\ninto Mrs. Cutter’s room. She was lying on her bed, in her night-gown and\nwrapper, shot through the heart. Her husband must have come in while she\nwas taking her afternoon nap and shot her, holding the revolver near her\nbreast. Her night-gown was burned from the powder.\n\nThe horrified neighbours rushed back to Cutter. He opened his eyes\nand said distinctly, ‘Mrs. Cutter is quite dead, gentlemen, and I am\nconscious. My affairs are in order.’ Then, Rudolph said, ‘he let go and\ndied.’\n\nOn his desk the coroner found a letter, dated at five o’clock that\nafternoon. It stated that he had just shot his wife; that any will she\nmight secretly have made would be invalid, as he survived her. He meant\nto shoot himself at six o’clock and would, if he had strength, fire a\nshot through the window in the hope that passersby might come in and see\nhim ‘before life was extinct,’ as he wrote.\n\n‘Now, would you have thought that man had such a cruel heart?’ Antonia\nturned to me after the story was told. ‘To go and do that poor woman out\nof any comfort she might have from his money after he was gone!’\n\n‘Did you ever hear of anybody else that killed himself for spite, Mr.\nBurden?’ asked Rudolph.\n\nI admitted that I hadn’t. Every lawyer learns over and over how strong\na motive hate can be, but in my collection of legal anecdotes I had\nnothing to match this one. When I asked how much the estate amounted to,\nRudolph said it was a little over a hundred thousand dollars.\n\nCuzak gave me a twinkling, sidelong glance. ‘The lawyers, they got a\ngood deal of it, sure,’ he said merrily.\n\nA hundred thousand dollars; so that was the fortune that had been\nscraped together by such hard dealing, and that Cutter himself had died\nfor in the end!\n\nAfter supper Cuzak and I took a stroll in the orchard and sat down by\nthe windmill to smoke. He told me his story as if it were my business to\nknow it.\n\nHis father was a shoemaker, his uncle a furrier, and he, being a younger\nson, was apprenticed to the latter’s trade. You never got anywhere\nworking for your relatives, he said, so when he was a journeyman he went\nto Vienna and worked in a big fur shop, earning good money. But a young\nfellow who liked a good time didn’t save anything in Vienna; there were\ntoo many pleasant ways of spending every night what he’d made in the\nday. After three years there, he came to New York. He was badly advised\nand went to work on furs during a strike, when the factories were\noffering big wages. The strikers won, and Cuzak was blacklisted. As he\nhad a few hundred dollars ahead, he decided to go to Florida and raise\noranges. He had always thought he would like to raise oranges! The\nsecond year a hard frost killed his young grove, and he fell ill with\nmalaria. He came to Nebraska to visit his cousin, Anton Jelinek, and\nto look about. When he began to look about, he saw Antonia, and she\nwas exactly the kind of girl he had always been hunting for. They were\nmarried at once, though he had to borrow money from his cousin to buy\nthe wedding ring.\n\n‘It was a pretty hard job, breaking up this place and making the first\ncrops grow,’ he said, pushing back his hat and scratching his grizzled\nhair. ‘Sometimes I git awful sore on this place and want to quit, but my\nwife she always say we better stick it out. The babies come along pretty\nfast, so it look like it be hard to move, anyhow. I guess she was right,\nall right. We got this place clear now. We pay only twenty dollars an\nacre then, and I been offered a hundred. We bought another quarter ten\nyears ago, and we got it most paid for. We got plenty boys; we can work\na lot of land. Yes, she is a good wife for a poor man. She ain’t always\nso strict with me, neither. Sometimes maybe I drink a little too much\nbeer in town, and when I come home she don’t say nothing. She don’t ask\nme no questions. We always get along fine, her and me, like at first.\nThe children don’t make trouble between us, like sometimes happens.’ He\nlit another pipe and pulled on it contentedly.\n\nI found Cuzak a most companionable fellow. He asked me a great\nmany questions about my trip through Bohemia, about Vienna and the\nRingstrasse and the theatres.\n\n‘Gee! I like to go back there once, when the boys is big enough to farm\nthe place. Sometimes when I read the papers from the old country, I\npretty near run away,’ he confessed with a little laugh. ‘I never did\nthink how I would be a settled man like this.’\n\nHe was still, as Antonia said, a city man. He liked theatres and lighted\nstreets and music and a game of dominoes after the day’s work was over.\nHis sociability was stronger than his acquisitive instinct. He liked\nto live day by day and night by night, sharing in the excitement of the\ncrowd.--Yet his wife had managed to hold him here on a farm, in one of\nthe loneliest countries in the world.\n\nI could see the little chap, sitting here every evening by the windmill,\nnursing his pipe and listening to the silence; the wheeze of the pump,\nthe grunting of the pigs, an occasional squawking when the hens were\ndisturbed by a rat. It did rather seem to me that Cuzak had been made\nthe instrument of Antonia’s special mission. This was a fine life,\ncertainly, but it wasn’t the kind of life he had wanted to live. I\nwondered whether the life that was right for one was ever right for two!\n\nI asked Cuzak if he didn’t find it hard to do without the gay company\nhe had always been used to. He knocked out his pipe against an upright,\nsighed, and dropped it into his pocket.\n\n‘At first I near go crazy with lonesomeness,’ he said frankly, ‘but my\nwoman is got such a warm heart. She always make it as good for me as she\ncould. Now it ain’t so bad; I can begin to have some fun with my boys,\nalready!’\n\nAs we walked toward the house, Cuzak cocked his hat jauntily over one\near and looked up at the moon. ‘Gee!’ he said in a hushed voice, as\nif he had just wakened up, ‘it don’t seem like I am away from there\ntwenty-six year!’\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nAFTER DINNER THE NEXT day I said good-bye and drove back to Hastings to\ntake the train for Black Hawk. Antonia and her children gathered round\nmy buggy before I started, and even the little ones looked up at me with\nfriendly faces. Leo and Ambrosch ran ahead to open the lane gate. When\nI reached the bottom of the hill, I glanced back. The group was still\nthere by the windmill. Antonia was waving her apron.\n\nAt the gate Ambrosch lingered beside my buggy, resting his arm on the\nwheel-rim. Leo slipped through the fence and ran off into the pasture.\n\n‘That’s like him,’ his brother said with a shrug. ‘He’s a crazy kid.\nMaybe he’s sorry to have you go, and maybe he’s jealous. He’s jealous of\nanybody mother makes a fuss over, even the priest.’\n\nI found I hated to leave this boy, with his pleasant voice and his fine\nhead and eyes. He looked very manly as he stood there without a hat, the\nwind rippling his shirt about his brown neck and shoulders.\n\n‘Don’t forget that you and Rudolph are going hunting with me up on the\nNiobrara next summer,’ I said. ‘Your father’s agreed to let you off\nafter harvest.’\n\nHe smiled. ‘I won’t likely forget. I’ve never had such a nice thing\noffered to me before. I don’t know what makes you so nice to us boys,’\nhe added, blushing.\n\n‘Oh, yes, you do!’ I said, gathering up my reins.\n\nHe made no answer to this, except to smile at me with unabashed pleasure\nand affection as I drove away.\n\nMy day in Black Hawk was disappointing. Most of my old friends were\ndead or had moved away. Strange children, who meant nothing to me, were\nplaying in the Harlings’ big yard when I passed; the mountain ash had\nbeen cut down, and only a sprouting stump was left of the tall Lombardy\npoplar that used to guard the gate. I hurried on. The rest of the\nmorning I spent with Anton Jelinek, under a shady cottonwood tree in\nthe yard behind his saloon. While I was having my midday dinner at the\nhotel, I met one of the old lawyers who was still in practice, and he\ntook me up to his office and talked over the Cutter case with me. After\nthat, I scarcely knew how to put in the time until the night express was\ndue.\n\nI took a long walk north of the town, out into the pastures where the\nland was so rough that it had never been ploughed up, and the long red\ngrass of early times still grew shaggy over the draws and hillocks. Out\nthere I felt at home again. Overhead the sky was that indescribable blue\nof autumn; bright and shadowless, hard as enamel. To the south I could\nsee the dun-shaded river bluffs that used to look so big to me, and all\nabout stretched drying cornfields, of the pale-gold colour, I remembered\nso well. Russian thistles were blowing across the uplands and piling\nagainst the wire fences like barricades. Along the cattle-paths the\nplumes of goldenrod were already fading into sun-warmed velvet, grey\nwith gold threads in it. I had escaped from the curious depression that\nhangs over little towns, and my mind was full of pleasant things; trips\nI meant to take with the Cuzak boys, in the Bad Lands and up on the\nStinking Water. There were enough Cuzaks to play with for a long while\nyet. Even after the boys grew up, there would always be Cuzak himself! I\nmeant to tramp along a few miles of lighted streets with Cuzak.\n\nAs I wandered over those rough pastures, I had the good luck to stumble\nupon a bit of the first road that went from Black Hawk out to the north\ncountry; to my grandfather’s farm, then on to the Shimerdas’ and to the\nNorwegian settlement. Everywhere else it had been ploughed under when\nthe highways were surveyed; this half-mile or so within the pasture\nfence was all that was left of that old road which used to run like\na wild thing across the open prairie, clinging to the high places and\ncircling and doubling like a rabbit before the hounds.\n\nOn the level land the tracks had almost disappeared--were mere shadings\nin the grass, and a stranger would not have noticed them. But wherever\nthe road had crossed a draw, it was easy to find. The rains had made\nchannels of the wheel-ruts and washed them so deeply that the sod had\nnever healed over them. They looked like gashes torn by a grizzly’s\nclaws, on the slopes where the farm-wagons used to lurch up out of the\nhollows with a pull that brought curling muscles on the smooth hips\nof the horses. I sat down and watched the haystacks turn rosy in the\nslanting sunlight.\n\nThis was the road over which Antonia and I came on that night when\nwe got off the train at Black Hawk and were bedded down in the straw,\nwondering children, being taken we knew not whither. I had only to close\nmy eyes to hear the rumbling of the wagons in the dark, and to be again\novercome by that obliterating strangeness. The feelings of that night\nwere so near that I could reach out and touch them with my hand. I\nhad the sense of coming home to myself, and of having found out what a\nlittle circle man’s experience is. For Antonia and for me, this had been\nthe road of Destiny; had taken us to those early accidents of fortune\nwhich predetermined for us all that we can ever be. Now I understood\nthat the same road was to bring us together again. Whatever we had\nmissed, we possessed together the precious, the incommunicable past.",
