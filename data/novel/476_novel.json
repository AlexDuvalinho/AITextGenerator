 "text": "James Nasmyth: Engineer, An Autobiography.\n\nEdited by Samuel Smiles, LL.D.\n\n(this Etext is taken from the popular edition, pub. John Murray 1897)\n\n\nPREFACE\n\nI have had much pleasure in editing the following Memoir of my friend\nMr. Nasmyth.  Some twenty years since (in April 1863), when I applied\nto him for information respecting his mechanical inventions, he\nreplied:  \"My life presents no striking or remarkable incidents,\nand would, I fear, prove but a tame narrative.  The sphere to which my\nendeavours have been confined has been of a comparatively quiet order;\nbut, vanity apart, I hope I have been able to leave a few marks of my\nexistence behind me in the shape of useful contrivances, which are in\nmany ways helping on great works of industry.\"\n\nMr. Nasmyth, nevertheless, kindly furnished me with information\nrespecting himself, as well as his former master and instructor,\nHenry Maudslay, of London, for the purpose of being inserted in\nIndustrial Biography, or Ironworkers and Toolmakers, which was\npublished at the end of 1863.  He was of opinion that the outline of\nhis life there presented was sufficiently descriptive of his career as\na mechanic and inventor.\n\nDuring the years that have elapsed since then, Mr. Nasmyth has been\nprevailed upon by some of his friends more especially by Sir John\nAnderson, late of Woolwich Arsenal--to note down the reminiscences of\nhis life, with an account of his inventions, and to publish them for\nthe benefit of others.  He has accordingly spent some of his well\nearned leisure during the last two years in writing out his\nrecollections.  Having consulted me on the subject, I recommended that\nthey should be published in the form of an Autobiography, and he has\nwillingly given his consent.\n\nMr. Nasmyth has furnished me with abundant notes of his busy life,\nand he has requested me, in preparing them for publication, to\n\"make use of the pruning-knife.\"  I hope, however, that in editing the\nbook I have not omitted anything that is likely to be interesting or\ninstructive.  I must add that everything has been submitted to his\ncorrection and received his final approval.\n\nThe narrative abundantly illustrates Mr. Nasmyth's own definition of\nengineering; namely, common sense applied to the use of materials.\nIn his case, common sense has been more especially applied to\nfacilitating and perfecting work by means of Machine Tools.\nCivilisation began with tools; and every step in advance has been\naccomplished through their improvement.  Handicraft labour, in bone,\nstone, or wood, was the first stage in the development of man's power;\nand tools or machines, in iron or steel, are the last and most\nefficient method of economising it, and enabling him to intelligently\ndirect the active and inert forces of nature.\n\nIt will be observed that Mr. Nasmyth, on his first start in life,\nowed much to the influence of his father, who was not only an admirable\nartist--\"the founder,\" as Sir David Wilkie termed him, \"of the\nlandscape painting school of Scotland\"--but an excellent mechanic.\nHis \"bow-and-string\" roofs and bridges show his original merits as a\ndesigner; and are sufficient to establish his ability as a mechanical\nengineer.  Indeed, one of Mr. Nasmyth's principal objects in preparing\nthe notes of the following work, has been to introduce a Memorial to\nthe memory of his father, to whom he owed so much, and to whom he was\nso greatly attached through life. Hence the numerous references to him,\nand the illustrations from his works of art, of architecture,\nas well as of mechanics, given in the early part of the book.\n\nI might point out that Mr. Nasmyth's narrative has a strong bearing\nupon popular education; not only as regards economical use of time,\ncareful observation, close attention to details, but as respects the\nuses of Drawing.  The observations which he makes as to the accurate\nknowledge of this art are very important.  In this matter he concurs\nwith Mr. Herbert Spencer in his work on Education.  \"It is very strange,\"\nMr. Nasmyth said some years ago, \"that amidst all our vaunted\nimprovements in education, the faculty of comparison by sight, or what\nmay be commonly called the correctness of eye, has been so little\nattended to\" He accordingly urges the teaching of rudimentary drawing in\nall public schools.  \"Drawing is,\" he says, \"the Education of the Eye.\nIt is more interesting than words.  It is graphic language.\"\n\nThe illustrations given in the course of the following book will serve\nto show his own mastery of drawing whether as respects Mechanical\ndetails, the Moon's surface, or the fairyland of Landscape.\nIt is perhaps not saying too much to aver that had he not devoted his\nbusiness life to Mechanics, he would, like his father, his brother\nPatrick, and his sisters, have taken a high position as an artist.\nIn the following Memoir we have only been able to introduce a few\nspecimens of his drawings; but \"The Fairies,\" \"The Antiquary,\"\nand others, will give the reader a good idea of Mr. Nasmyth's artistic\nability.  Since his retirement from business life, at the age of\nforty-eight, Mr. Nasmyth's principal pursuit has been Astronomy.\nHis Monograph on \"The Moon,\" published in 1874, exhibits his ardent and\nphilosophic love for science in one of its sublimest aspects.\nHis splendid astronomical instruments, for the most part made entirely\nby his own hands, have enabled him to detect the \"willow leaf-shaped\"\nobjects which form the structural element of the Sun's luminous\nsurface.  The discovery was shortly after verified by Sir John Herschel\nand other astronomers, and is now a received fact in astronomical\nscience.\n\nA Chronological List of some of Mr. Nasmyth's contrivances and\ninventions is given at the end of the volume, which shows, so far,\nwhat he has been enabled to accomplish during his mechanical career.\nThese begin at a very early age, and were continued for about thirty\nyears of a busy and active life.  Very few of them were patented;\nmany of them, though widely adopted, are unacknowledged as his\ninvention. They, nevertheless, did much to advance the mechanical arts,\nand still continue to do excellent service in the engineering world.\n\nThe chapter relating to the origin of the Cuneiform Character,\nand of the Pyramid or Sun-worship in its relation to Egyptian\nArchitecture, is placed at the end, so as not to interrupt the personal\nnarrative. That chapter, it is believed, will be found very\ninteresting, illustrated, as it is, by Mr. Nasmyth's drawings.\n\nS.S.\n\nLONDON, October 1885.\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\nPreface\n\nList of Illustrations

My Ancestry\n\nOur history begins before we are born.  We represent the hereditary\ninfluences of our race, and our ancestors virtually live in us.\nThe sentiment of ancestry seems to be inherent in human nature,\nespecially in the more civilised races.  At all events, we cannot help\nhaving a due regard for the history of our forefathers.  Our curiosity\nis stimulated by their immediate or indirect influence upon ourselves.\nIt may be a generous enthusiasm, or, as some might say, a harmless\nvanity, to take pride in the honour of their name.  The gifts of nature,\nhowever, are more valuable than those of fortune; and no line of\nancestry, however honourable, can absolve us from the duty of diligent\napplication and perseverance, or from the practice of the virtues of\nself-control and self-help.\n\nSir Bernard Burke, in his Peerage and Baronetage Ed 1879 Pp 885-6,\ngives a faithful account of the ancestors from whom I am lineally\ndescended.  \"The family of Naesymth, he says, \"is one of remote\nantiquity in Tweeddale, and has possessed lands there since the 13th\ncentury.\"  They fought in the wars of Bruce and Baliol, which ended in\nthe independence of Scotland.\n\nThe following is the family legend of the origin of the name of\nNaesymth: --\n\nIn the troublous times which prevailed in Scotland before the union of\nthe Crowns, the feuds between the King and the Barons were almost\nconstant.  In the reign of James III. the House of Douglas was the\nmost prominent and ambitious.  The Earl not only resisted his liege\nlord, but entered into a combination with the King of England, from\nwhom he received a pension.  He was declared a rebel, and his estates\nwere confiscated.  He determined to resist the royal power, and crossed\nthe Border with his followers.  He was met by the Earl of Angus, the\nMaxwells, the Johnstons, and the Scotts.  In one of the engagements\nwhich ensued the Douglases appeared to have gained the day, when an\nancestor of the Naesmyths, who fought under the royal standard, took\nrefuge in the smithy of a neighbouring village.  The smith offered him\nprotection, disguised him as a hammerman, with a leather apron in\nfront, and asked him to lend a hand at his work.\n\nWhile thus engaged a party of the Douglas partisans entered the smithy.\nThey looked with suspicion on the disguised hammerman, who, in his\nagitation, struck a false blow with the sledge hammer, which broke the\nshaft in two.  Upon this, one of the pursuers rushed at him, calling\nout, \"Ye're nae smyth!\"  The stalwart hammerman turned upon his\nassailant, and, wrenching a dagger from him, speedily overpowered him.\nThe smith himself, armed with a big hammer, effectually aided in\noverpowering and driving out the Douglas men.  A party of the royal\nforces made their appearance, when Naesmyth rallied them, led them\nagainst the rebels, and converted what had been a temporary defeat into\na victory.  A grant of lands was bestowed upon him for his service.\nHis armorial bearings consisted of a hand dexter with a dagger, between\ntwo broken hammer-shafts, and there they remain to this day.  The motto\nwas, Non arte sect marte, \"Not by art but by war\" In my time I have\nreversed the motto (Non marte sed arte); and instead of the broken\nhammer-shafts, I have adopted, not as my \"arms\" but as a device,\nthe most potent form of mechanical art--the Steam Hammer.\n\n[Image] Origin of the Name.  By James Nasmyth.\n\nSir Michael Naesmyth, Chamberlain of the Archbishop of St. Andrews,\nobtained the lands of Posso and Glenarth in 1544, by right of his wife,\nElizabeth, daughter and heiress of John Baird of Posso.  The Bairds\nhave ever been a loyal and gallant family.  Sir Gilbert, father of John\nBaird, fell at Flodden in 1513, in defence of his king.\n\nThe royal eyrie of Posso Crag is on the family estate;\nand the Lure worn by Queen Mary, and presented by her son James VI. to\nJames Naesmyth, the Royal Falconer, is still preserved as a family\nheirloom.\n\nDuring the intestine troubles in Scotland, in the reign of Mary,\nSir Michael Naesmyth espoused the cause of the unfortunate Queen.\nHe fought under her banner at Langside in 1568.  He was banished,\nand his estates were seized by the Regent Moray.  But after the\nrestoration of peace, the Naesmyths regained their property.\nSir Michael died at an advanced age.\n\nHe had many sons.  The eldest, James, married Joana, daughter of\nWilliam Veitch or Le Veitch of Dawick.  By this marriage the lands of\nDawick came into the family.  He predeceased his father, and was\nsucceeded by his son James, the Royal Falconer above referred to.\nSir Michael's second son, John, was chief chirurgeon to James VI. of\nScotland, afterwards James I. of England, and to Henry, Prince of\nWales.  He died in London in 1613, and in his testament he leaves\n\"his herb to his young master, the Prince's grace.\"  Charles I.,\nin his instructions to the President of the Court of Session, enjoins\n\"that you take special notice of the children of John Naesmyth, so\noften recommended by our late dear father and us.\"  Two of Sir Michael's\nother sons were killed at Edinburgh in 1588, in a deadly feud between\nthe Scotts and the Naesmyths.  In those days a sort of Corsican\nvendetta was carried on between families from one generation to\nanother.\n\nSir Michael Naesmyth, son of the Royal Falconer, succeeded to the\nproperty.  His eldest son James was appointed to serve in Claverhouse's\ntroop of horse in 1684.  Among the other notable members of the family\nwas James Naesmyth, a very clever lawyer.  He was supposed to be so\ndeep that he was generally known as the \"Deil o' Dawyk\".   His eldest\nson was long a member of Parliament for the county of Peebles; he was,\nbesides, a famous botanist, having studied under Linnaeus, Among the\ninter-marriages of the family were those with the Bruces of Lethen, the\nStewarts of Traquhair, the Murrays of Stanhope, the Pringles of Clifton,\nthe Murrays of Philiphaugh, the Keiths (of the Earl Marischal's family),\nthe Andersons of St. Germains, the Marjoribanks of Lees, and others.\n\nIn the fourteenth century a branch of the Naesmyths of Posso settled at\nNetherton, near Hamilton.  They bought an estate and built a residence.\nThe lands adjoined part of the Duke of Hamilton's estate, and the house\nwas not far from the palace.  There the Naesmyths remained until the\nreign of Charles II. The King, or his advisers, determined to\nintroduce Episcopacy, or, as some thought, Roman Catholicism, into the\ncountry, and to enforce it at the point of the sword.\n\nThe Naesmyths had always been loyal until now.  But to be cleft by\nsword and pricked by spear into a religion which they disbelieved, was\nutterly hateful to the Netherton Naesmyths.  Being Presbyterians, they\nheld to their own faith.  They were prevented from using their\nchurches,*\n [footnote...\nIn the reign of James II. of England and James VII. of Scotland a law\nwas enacted, \"that whoever should preach in a conventicle under a roof,\nor should attend, either as a preacher or as a hearer, a conventicle in\nthe open air, should be punished with death and confiscation of\nproperty.\"\n ...]\nand they accordingly met on the moors, or in unfrequented places for\nworship.  The dissenting Presbyterians assumed the name of Covenanters.\nHamilton was almost the centre of the movement.  The Covenanters met,\nand the King's forces were ordered to disperse them.  Hence the\ninternecine war that followed.  There were Naesmyths on both sides--\nNaesmyths for the King, and Naesmyths for the Covenant.\n\nIn an early engagement at Drumclog, the Covenanters were victorious.\nThey beat back Claverhouse and his dragoons.  A general rising took\nplace in the West Country.  About 6000 men assembled at Hamilton,\nmostly raw and undisciplined countrymen.  The King's forces assembled\nto meet them, -- 10,000 well-disciplined troops, with a complete train\nof field artillery.  What chance had the Covenanters against such a\nforce?  Nevertheless, they met at Bothwell Bridge, a few miles west of\nHamilton. It is unnecessary to describe the action.*\n [footnote...\nSee the account of a Covenanting Officer in the Appendix to the Scots\nWorthies.  See also Sir Waiter Scott's Old Mortality, where the battle\nof Bothwell Brig is described.\n ...]\n\nThe Covenanters, notwithstanding their inferior force, resisted the\ncannonade and musketry of the enemy with great courage.  They defended\nthe bridge until their ammunition failed.  When the English Guards and\nthe artillery crossed the bridge, the battle was lost.  The Covenanters\ngave way, and fled in all directions; Claverhouse, burning with revenge\nfor his defeat at Drumclog, made a terrible slaughter of the\nunresisting fugitives.  One of my ancestors brought from the\nbattlefield the remnant of the standard; a formidable musquet--\n\"Gun Bothwell\" we afterwards called it; an Andrea Ferrara; and a\npowder-horn.  I still preserve these remnants of the civil war.\n\nMy ancestor was condemned to death in his absence, and his property at\nNetherton was confiscated.  What became of him during the remainder of\nCharles II.'s reign, and the reign of that still greater tormentor,\nJames II., I do not know.  He was probably, like many others, wandering\nabout from place to place, hiding \"in wildernesses or caves, destitute,\nafflicted, and tormented.\"  The arrival of William III. restored\nreligious liberty to the country, and Scotland was again left in\ncomparative peace.\n\nMy ancestor took refuge in Edinburgh, but he never recovered his\nproperty at Netherton.  The Duke of Hamilton, one of the trimmers of\nthe time, had long coveted the possession of the lands, as Ahab had\ncoveted Naboth's vineyard.  He took advantage of the conscription of\nthe men engaged in the Bothwell Brig conflict, and had the lands\nforfeited in his favour.  I remember my father telling me that, on one\noccasion when he visited the Duke of Hamilton in reference to some\nimprovement of the grounds adjoining the palace, he pointed out to the\nDuke the ruined remains of the old residence of the Naesmyths.  As the\nfirst French Revolution was then in full progress, when ideas of\nsociety and property seemed to have lost their bearings, the Duke\ngood-humouredly observed, \"Well, well, Naesmyth, there's no saying but\nwhat, some of these days, your ancestors' lands may come into your\npossession again!\"\n\nBefore I quit the persecutions of \"the good old times,\" I must refer to\nthe burning of witches.  One of my ancient kinswomen, Elspeth Naesmyth,\nwho lived at Hamilton, was denounced as a witch.  The chief evidence\nbrought against her was that she kept four black cats, and read her\nBible with two pairs of spectacles!  a practice which shows that she\npossessed the spirit of an experimental philosopher.\n\nIn doing this she adopted a mode of supplementing the power of\nspectacles in restoring the receding power of the eyes.  She was in all\nrespects scientifically correct.  She increased the magnifying power of\nthe glasses; a practice which is preferable to using single glasses of\nthe same power, and which I myself often follow.  Notwithstanding this\nimproved method of reading her Bible, and her four black cats, she was\ncondemned to be burned alive!  She was about the last victim in\nScotland to the disgraceful superstition of witchcraft.\n\nThe Naesmyths of Netherton having lost their ancestral property, had to\nbegin the world again.  They had to begin at the beginning.\nBut they had plenty of pluck and energy.  I go back to my\ngreat-great-grandfather, Michael Naesmyth, who was born in 1652.\nHe occupied a house in the Grassmarket, Edinburgh, which was afterwards\nrebuilt, in 1696.  His business was that of a builder and architect.\nHis chief employment was in designing and erecting new mansions,\nprincipally for the landed gentry and nobility.  Their old castellated\nhouses or towers were found too dark and dreary for modern uses.\nThe drawbridges were taken down, and the moats were filled up.\nSometimes they built the new mansions as an addition to the old.\nBut oftener they left the old castles to go to ruin; or, what was\nworse, they made use of the stone and other materials of the old\nromantic buildings for the construction of their new residences.\n\nMichael Naesmyth acquired a high reputation for the substantiality of\nhis work.  His masonry was excellent, as well as his woodwork.\nThe greater part of the latter was executed in his own workshops at the\nback of his house in the Grassmarket.  His large yard was situated\nbetween the back of the house and the high wall that bounded the\nGreyfriars Churchyard,to the east of the flight of steps which forms\nthe main approach to George Heriot's Hospital.\n\n[Image] Michael Naesmyth's House, Grassmarket.The lower building at the\n        right hand corner of the engraving, with the three projecting\n        gable ends\n\nThe last work that Michael Naesmyth was engaged in cost him his life.\nHe had contracted with the Government to build a fort at Inversnaid,\nat the northern end of Loch Lomond.  It was intended to guard the\nLowlands, and keep Rob Roy and his caterans within the Highland Border.\nA promise was given by the Government that during the progress of the\nwork a suitable force of soldiers should be quartered close at hand to\nprotect the builder and his workmen.\n\n[Image] Inversnaid Fort.  After a drawing by Alexander Nasmyth\n\nNotwithstanding many whispered warnings as to the danger of undertaking\nsuch a hazardous work, Michael Naesmyth and his men encamped upon the\nspot, though without the protection of the Government force.  Having\nerected a temporary residence for their accommodation, he proceeded\nwith the building of the fort.  The work was well advanced by the end\nof 1703, although the Government had treated all Naesmyth's appeals for\nprotection with evasion or contempt.\n\nWinter set in with its usual force in those northern regions.\nOne dark and snowy night, when Michael and his men had retired to rest,\na loud knocking was heard at the door.  \"Who's there?\"  asked Michael.\nA man outside replied, \"A benighted traveller overt aken by the storm\"\nHe proceeded to implore help, and begged for God's sake that he might\nhave shelter for the night.  Naesmyth, in the full belief that the\ntraveller's tale was true, unbolted and unbarred the door, when in\nrushed Rob Roy and his desperate gang.  The men, with the dirks of the\nMacgregors at their throats, begged hard for their lives.  This was\ngranted on condition that they should instantly depart, and take an\noath that they should never venture within the Highland border again.\n\nMichael Naesmyth and his men had no alternative but to submit, and they\nat once left the bothy with such scanty clothing as the Macgregors\nwould allow them to carry away.  They were marched under an armed\nescort through the snowstorm to the Highland border, and were there\nleft with the murderous threat that, if they ever returned to the fort,\nthey would meet with certain death.\n\nAnother attempt was made to build the fort at Inversnaid.  But Rob Roy\nagain surprised the small party of soldiers who were in charge.\nThey were disarmed and sent about their business.  Finally, the fort\nwas rebuilt, and placed under the command of Captain (afterwards\nGeneral) Wolfe.  When peace fell upon the Highlands and Rob Roy's\ncountry became the scene of picnics, the fort was abandoned and allowed\nto go to ruin.\n\nPoor Michael never recovered from the cold which he caught during his\nforced retreat from Inversnaid.  The effects of this, together with the\nloss and distress of mind which he experienced from the Government's\nrefusal to pay for his work--notwithstanding their promise to protect\nhim and his workmen from the Highland freebooters--so preyed upon his\nmind that he was never again able to devote himself to business.\nOne evening, whilst sitting at his fireside with his grandchild on his\nknee, a death-like faintness came over him; he set the child down\ncarefully by the side of his chair, and then fell forward dead on his\nhearthstone.\n\nThus ended the life of Michael Naesmyth in 1705, at the age of\nfifty-three.  He was buried by the side of his ancestors in the old\nfamily tomb in the Greyfriars Churchyard.\n\n[Image] The Naesmyth Tomb in Greyfriars Churchyard\n\nThis old tomb, dated 1614, though much defaced, is one of the most\nremarkable of the many which surround the walls of that ancient and\nmemorable burying-place.\n\nGreyfriars Churchyard is one of the most interesting places in\nEdinburgh.  The National Covenant was signed there by the Protestant\nnobles and gentry of Scotland in 1638.  The prisoners taken at the\nbattle of Bothwell Brig were shut up there in 1679, and, after enduring\ngreat privations, a portion of the survivors were sent off to\nBarbadoes.  When I first saw the tombstone, an ash tree was growing out\nof the top of the main body of it, though that has since been removed.\nIn growing, the roots had pushed out the centre stone, which has not\nbeen replaced.  The tablet over it contains the arms of the family,\nthe broken hammer-shafts, and the motto \"Non arte sed marte.\"  There are\nthe remains of a very impressive figure, apparently rising from her\ncerements.  The body and extremities remain, but the head has been\nbroken away.  There is also a remarkable motto on the tablet above the\ntombstone--\"Ars mihi vim contra Fortunce; which I take to be,\n\"Art is my strength in contending against Fortune,\"--a motto which is\nappropriate to my ancestors as well as to myself.\n\nThe business was afterwards carried on by Michael's son, my\ngreat-grandfather.  He was twenty-seven years old at the time of his\nfather's death, and lived to the age of seventy-three.  He was a man of\nmuch ability and of large experience.\n\nOne of his great advantages in carrying on his business was the support\nof a staff of able and trustworthy foremen and workmen.  The times were\nvery different then from what they are now.  Masters and men lived\ntogether in mutual harmony.  There was a kind of loyal family\nattachment among them, which extended through many generations.\nWorkmen had neither the desire nor the means to shift about from place\nto place.  On the contrary, they settled down with their wives and\nfamilies in houses of their own, close to the workshops of their\nemployers.  Work was found for them in the dull seasons when trade was\nslack, and in summer they sometimes removed to jobs at a distance from\nheadquarters.  Much of this feeling of attachment and loyalty between\nworkmen and their employers has now expired.  Men rapidly remove from\nplace to place.  Character is of little consequence.  The mutual\nfeeling of goodwill and zealous attention to work seems to have passed\naway.\n\nMy grandfather, Michael Naesmyth, succeeded to the business in 1751.\nHe more than maintained the reputation of his predecessors.\nThe collection of first-class works on architecture which he possessed,\nsuch as the folio editions of Vitruvius and Palladio, which were at\nthat time both rare and dear, showed the regard he had for impressing\ninto his designs the best standards of taste.  The buildings he\ndesigned and erected for the Scotch nobility and gentry were well\narranged, carefully executed, and thoroughly substantial.  He was also\na large builder in Edinburgh.  Amongst the houses he erected in the\nOld Town were the principal number of those in George Square.  In one\nof these, No. 25, Sir Walter Scott spent his boyhood and youth.\nThey still exist, and exhibit the care which he took in the elegance\nand substantiality of his works.\n\nI remember my father pointing out to me the extreme care and attention\nwith which he finished his buildings.  He inserted small fragments of\nbasalt into the mortar of the external joints of the stones, at close\nand regular distances, in order to protect the mortar from the adverse\naction of the weather.  And to this day they give proof of their\nefficiency.  The basalt protects the joints, and at the same time gives\na neat and pleasing effect to what would otherwise have been merely the\nmonotonous line of mason-work.\n\nA great change was about to take place in the residences of the\nprincipal people of Edinburgh.  The cry was for more light and more\nair. The extension of the city to the south and west was not\nsufficient. There was a great plateau of ground on the north side of\nthe city, beyond the North Loch.  But it was very difficult to reach;\nbeing alike steep on both sides of the Loch.  At length, in 1767,\nan Act was obtained to extend the royalty of the city over the northern\nfields, and powers were obtained to erect a bridge to connect them with\nthe Old Town.\n\nThe magistrates had the greatest difficulty in inducing the inhabitants\nto build dwellings on the northern side of the city.  A premium was\noffered to the person who should build the first house; and #20 was\nawarded to Mr. John Young on account of a mansion erected by him close\nto George Street.  Exemption from burghal taxes was also granted to a\ngentleman who built the first house in Princes Street.  My grandfather\nbuilt the first house in the south-west corner of St. Andrew Square,\nfor the occupation of David Hume the historian, as well as the two most\nimportant houses in the centre of the north side of the same square.\nOne of these last was occupied by the venerable Dr. Hamilton, a very\nconspicuous character in Edinburgh.  He continued to wear the cocked\nhat, the powdered pigtail, tights, and large shoe buckles, for about\nsixty years after this costume had become obsolete.  All these houses\nare still in perfect condition, after resisting the ordinary tear and\nwear of upwards of a hundred and ten northern winters.  The opposition\nto building houses across the North Loch soon ceased; and the New Town\narose, growing from day to day, until Edinburgh became one of the most\nhandsome and picturesque cities in Europe.\n\nThere is one other thing that I must again refer to the highly-finished\ncharacter of my grandfather's work.  Nothing merely moderate would do.\nThe work must be of the very best.  He took special pride in the sound\nquality of the woodwork and its careful workmanship.  He chose the best\nDantzic timber because of its being of purer grain and freer from knots\nthan other wood.  In those days the lower part of the walls of the\napartments were wainscoted--that is, covered by timber framed in\nlarge panels.  They were from three to four feet wide, and from six to\neight feet high.  To fit these in properly required the most careful\njoiner-work.\n\nIt was always a holiday treat to my father, when a boy, to be permitted\nto go down to Leith to see the ships discharge their cargoes of timber.\nMy grandfather had a Wood-yard at Leith, where the timber selected by\nhim was piled up to he seasoned and shrunk, before being worked into\nits appropriate uses.  He was particularly careful in his selection of\nboards or stripes for floors, which must be perfectly level, so as to\navoid the destruction of the carpets placed over them.  The hanging of\nhis doors was a matter that he took great pride in--so as to prevent\nany uneasy action in opening or closing.  His own chamber doors were so\nwell hung that they were capable of being opened and closed by the\nslight puff of a hand-bellows.\n\nThe excellence of my grandfather's workmanship was a thing that my own\nfather always impressed upon me when a boy.  It stimulated in me the\ndesire to aim at excellence in everything that I undertook; and in all\npractical matters to arrive at the highest degree of good workmanship.\nI believe that these early lessons had a great influence upon my future\ncareer.\n\nI have little to record of my grandmother.  From all accounts she was\neverything that a wife and mother should be.  My father often referred\nto her as an example of the affection and love of a wife to her\nhusband, and of a mother to her children.  The only relic I possess of\nher handiwork is a sampler, dated 1743, the needlework of which is so\ndelicate and neat, that to me it seems to excel everything of the kind\nthat I have seen.\n\nI am fain to think that her delicate manipulation in some respects\ndescended to her grandchildren, as all of them have been more or less\ndistinguished for the delicate use of their fingers--which has so\nmuch to do with the effective transmission of the artistic faculty into\nvisible forms.  The power of transmitting to paper or canvas the\nartistic conceptions of the brain through the fingers, and out at the\nend of the needle, the pencil, the pen, the brush, or even the\nmodelling tool or chisel, is that which, in practical fact, constitutes\nthe true artist.\n\nThis may appear a digression; though I cannot look at my grandmother's\nsampler without thinking that she had much to do with originating the\nNaesmyth love of the Fine Arts, and their hereditary adroitness in the\npractice of landscape and portrait painting, and other branches of the\nprofession.\n\nMy grandfather died in 1803, at the age of eighty-four, and was buried\nby his father's side in the Naesmyth ancestral tomb in Greyfriars\nChurchyard.  His wife, Mary Anderson, who died before him, was buried\nin the same place.\n\nMichael Naesmyth left two sons--Michael and Alexander.  The eldest\nwas born in 1754.  It was intended that he should have succeeded to the\nbusiness; and, indeed, as soon as he reached manhood he was his\nfather's right-hand man.  He was a skilful workman, especially in the\nfiner parts of joiner-work.  He was also an excellent accountant and\nbookkeeper.  But having acquired a taste for reading books about\nvoyages and travels, of which his father's library was well supplied,\nhis mind became disturbed, and he determined to see something of the\nworld.  He was encouraged by one of his old companions, who had been to\nsea, and realised some substantial results by his voyages to foreign\nparts. Accordingly Michael, notwithstanding the earnest remonstrances\nof his father, accompanied his friend on the next occasion when he went\nto sea.\n\nAfter several voyages to the West Indies and other parts of the world,\nwhich both gratified and stimulated his natural taste for adventures,\nand also proved financially successful, his trading ventures at last\nmet with a sad reverse, and he resolved to abandon commerce, and enter\nthe service of the Royal Navy.  He was made purser, and in this\nposition he entered upon a new series of adventures.  He was present at\nmany naval engagements.  But he lost neither life nor limb.  At last he\nwas pensioned, and became a resident at Greenwich Hospital.\nHe furnished his apartments with all manner of curiosities, such as his\nroving naval life had enabled him to collect.  His original skill as a\nworker in wood came to life again.  The taste of the workman and the\nhandiness of the seaman enabled him to furnish his rooms at the\nHospital in a most quaint and amusing manner.\n\nMy father had a most affectionate regard for Michael, and usually spent\nsome days with him when he had occasion to visit London.  One bright\nsummer day they went to have a stroll together on Blackheath; and while\nmy uncle was enjoying a nap on a grassy knoll, my father made a sketch\nof him, which I still preserve.  Being of a most cheerful disposition,\nand having a great knack of detailing the incidents of his adventurous\nlife, he became a great favourite with the resident officers of the\nHospital; and was always regarded by them as real good company.\nHe ended his days there in peace and comfort, in 1819, at the age of\nsixty-four.\n\n\nCHAPTER 2.   Alexander Nasmyth\n\nMy father, Alexander Nasmyth, was the second son of Michael Nasmyth.\nHe was born in his father's house in the Grassmarket on the 9th of\nSeptember 1758.  The Grassmarket was then a lively place.  On certain\ndays of the week it was busy with sheep and cattle fairs.  It was the\ncentre of Edinburgh traffic.  Most of the inns were situated there,\nor in the street leading up to the Greyfriars Church gate.\n\nThe view from my grandfather's house was very grand.  Standing up,\nright opposite, was the steep Castle rock, with its crown buildings and\ncircular battery towering high overhead.  They seemed almost to hang\nover the verge of the rock.  The houses on the opposite side of the\nGrassmarket were crowded under the esplanade of the Castle Hill.\n\nThere was an inn opposite the house where my father was born, from\nwhich the first coach started from Edinburgh to Newcastle.  The public\nnotice stated that \"The Coach would set out from the Grass Market ilka\nTuesday at Twa o'clock in the day, GOD WULLIN', but whether or no on\nWednesday.\"  The \"whether or no\" was meant, I presume, as a precaution to\npassengers, in case all the places on the coach might be taken, or not,\non Wednesday,\n\n[Image]  Plan of the Grassmarket\n\nThe Grassmarket was also the place for public executions.  The gibbet\nstone was at the east end of the Market.  It consisted of a mass of\nsolid sandstone, with a quadrangular hole in the middle, which served\nas a socket for the gallows.  Most of the Covenanters who were executed\nfor conscience' sake in the reigns of Charles II. and James II.\nbreathed their last at this spot.  The Porteous mob, in 1736, had its\nculmination here.  When Captain Porteous was dragged out of the\nTolbooth in the High Street and hurried down the West Bow, the gallows\nwas not in its place; but the leaders of the mob hanged him from a\ndyer's pole, nearly opposite the gallows stone, on the south side of\nthe street, not far from my grandfather's door*\n [footnote...\nSee Heart of Midlothian\n ...]\n\nI have not much to say about my father's education.  For the most part,\nhe was his own schoolmaster.  I have heard him say that his mother\ntaught him his A B C; and that he afterwards learned to read at Mammy\nSmith's.  This old lady kept a school for boys and girls at the top of\na house in the Grassmarket.  There my father was taught to rear his\nBible, and to repeat his Carritch.*\n [footnote...\nThe Shorter Catechism.\n ...]\n\nAs it was only the bigger boys who could read the Bible, the strongest\nof them consummated the feat by climbing up the Castle rock, and\nreaching what they called \"The Bibler's Seat.\"  It must have been a\nbreak-neck adventure to get up to the place.  The seat was almost\nimmediately under the window of the room in which James VI was born.\nMy father often pointed it out to me as one of the most dangerous bits\nof climbing in which he had been engaged in his younger years.\n\n[Image]  The Bibler's seat\n\nThe annexed illustration is from his own slight sepia drawing;\nthe Bibler's Seat is marked + Not so daring, but much more mischievous,\nwas a trick which he played with some of his companions on the tops of\nthe houses on the north side of the Grassmarket.  The boys took a\nbarrel to the Castlehill, filled it with small stones, and then shot it\ndown towards the roofs of the houses in the Grassmarket.  The barrel\nleapt from rock to rock, burst, and scattered a shower of stones far\nand wide.  The fun was to see the \"boddies\" look out of their garret\nwindows with their lighted lamps or candles, peer into the dark,\nand try to see what was the cause of the mischief.\n\nSir David Baird, the hero of Seringapatam, played a trick of the same\nkind before he went to India.\n\nAmong my father's favourite companions were the two sons of Dr. John\nErskine, minister of Old Greyfriars, in conjunction with the equally\ncelebrated Dr. Robertson.  Dr. Erskine*\n [footnote...\nDr. Erskine is well described by Scott in Guy Mannering, on the\noccasion when Pleydell and Mannering went to hear him preach a famous\nsermon.\n ...]\nwas a man of great influence in his day, well known for his literary\nand theological works, as well as for his piety and practical\nbenevolence.  On one occasion, when my father was at play with his\nsons, one of them threw a stone, which smashed a neighbour's window.\nA servant of the house ran out, and seeing the culprit, called out,\n\"Very wee!, Maister Erskine, I'll tell yeer faither wha broke the\nwindae!\"  On which the boy, to throw her off the scent, said to his\nbrother loudly, \"Eh, keist! she thinks we're the boddy Erskine's sons.\"\n\nThe boddy Erskine!  Who ever heard of such an irreverent nickname\napplied to that good and great man?  \"The laddies couldna be his sons,\"\nthought the woman.  She made no further inquiry, and the boys escaped\nscot free.  The culprit afterwards entered the service of the East\nIndia Company.  \"The boy was father to the man.\"  He acquired great\nreputation at the siege of Seringapatam, where he led the forlorn hope.\nErskine was promoted, until in course of time he returned to his native\ncity a full-blown general.  To return to my father's education.\nAfter he left \"Mammy Smith's, he went for a short time to the original\nHigh School.  It was an old establishment, founded by James VI. before\nhe succeeded to the English throne, It was afterwards demolished to\nmake room for the University buildings; and the new High School was\nerected a little below the old Royal Infirmary.  After leaving the High\nSchool, Alexander Nasmyth was taught by his father, first arithmetic\nand mensuration, next geometry and mathematics, so far as the first\nthree books of Euclid were concerned.  After that, his own innate\nskill, ability, and industry enabled him to complete the rest of his\neducation.\n\nAt a very early period my father exhibited a decided natural taste for\nart.  He used his pencil freely in sketching from nature; and in course\nof time he showed equal skill in the use of oil colour.  At his own\nearnest request he was bound apprentice to Mr. Crighton, then the\nchief coachbuilder in Edinburgh.  He was employed in that special\ndepartment where artistic taste was necessary--that is, in decorating\nthe panels of the highest class of carriages, and painting upon them\ncoats of arms, with their crests and supporters.  He took great\npleasure in this kind of work.  It introduced him to the practical\ndetails of heraldry, and gave him command over his materials.\n\nStill further to improve himself in the art of drawing, my father\ndevoted his evenings to attending the Edinburgh Drawing Academy.\nThis institution, termed \"The Trustees' Academy of Fine Art,\" had been\nformed and supported by the funds arising from the estates confiscated\nafter the rebellions of 1715 and 1745.  Part of these funds was set\napart by Government for the encouragement of drawing, and also for the\nestablishment of the arts of linen weaving, carpet manufacture,\nand other industrial occupations.\n\nThese arts were introduced into Scotland by the French Protestants,\nwho had been persecuted for conscience' sake out of their own country,\nand settled in England, Ireland, and Scotland, where they prosecuted\ntheir industrial callings.  The Corporation was anxious to afford an\nasylum for these skilled and able workmen.  The emigrants settled down\nwith their families, and pursued their occupations of damask, linen,\nand carpet weaving.  They were also required to take Scotch apprentices,\nand teach them the various branches of their trade.  The Magistrates\ncaused cottages and workshops to be erected on a piece of unoccupied\nland near Edinburgh, where the street appropriately called Picardy\nPlace now stands,--the greater number of the weavers having come from\nPicardy in France.\n\nIn connection with the establishment of these industrial artisans,\nit was necessary to teach the young Scotch apprentices drawing, for the\npurpose of designing new patterns suitable for the market.  Hence the\nestablishment by the Trustees of the Forfeited Estate Funds of\n\"The Academy of Fine Art.\"  From the designing of patterns, the\ninstitution advanced to the improvement of the fine arts generally.\nYoung men who had given proofs of their natural taste for drawing were\ninvited to enter the school and participate in its benefits.\n\nAt the time that my father was apprenticed to the coach painter,\nthe Trustees' Academy was managed by Alexander Runciman.  He had\noriginally been a house painter, from which business he proceeded to\nlandscape painting.  \"Other artists,\" said one who knew him, \"talked\nmeat and drink; but Runciman talked landscape.\"  He went to Rome and\nstudied art there.  He returned to Edinburgh, and devoted himself to\nhistorical painting.  He was also promoted to the office of master of\nthe Trustees' Academy.  When my father called upon him with his\ndrawings from nature, Runciman found them so satisfactory that he was\nat once admitted as a student.  After his admission he began to study\nwith intense eagerness.  The young men who had been occupied at their\nbusiness during the day could only attend in the evening.  And thus the\nevenings were fixed for studying drawing and design.  The Trustees'\nAcademy made its mark upon the art of Scotland: it turned out many\nartists of great note -- such as Raeburn, Wilkie, my father, and many\nmore.\n\nAt the time when my father entered as a student, the stock of casts\nfrom the antique, and the number of drawings from the old masters,\nwere very small; so much so, indeed, that Runciman was under the\nnecessity of setting the students to copy them again and again.\nThis became rather irksome to the more ardent pupils.  My father had\ncompleted his sixth copy of a fine chalk drawing of \"The Laocoon.\"\nIt was then set for him to copy again.  He begged Mr. Runciman for\nanother subject.  The quick-tempered man at once said,\"l'll give you\nanother subject.\"  And turning the group of the Laocoon upside down, he\nadded, \"Now, then, copy that!\"  The patient youth set to work, and in a\nfew evenings completed a perfect copy.  It was a most severe test; but\nRunciman was so proud of the skill of his pupil that he had the drawing\nmounted and framed, with a note of the circumstances under which it had\nbeen produced.  It continued to hang there for many years, and the\nstory of its achievement became traditional in the school.\n\nDuring all this time my father remained in the employment of Crighton\nthe carriage builder.  He improved in his painting day by day.  But at\nlength an important change took place in his career.  Allan Ramsay,\nson of the author of The Gentle Shepherd, and then court painter to\nGeorge III., called upon his old friend Crighton one day, to look over\nhis works.  There he found young Nasmyth painting a coat of arms on the\npanel of a carriage.  He was so much surprised with the lad's artistic\nworkmanship--for he was then only sixteen--that he formed a strong\ndesire to take him into his service.  After much persuasion, backed by\nthe offer of a considerable sum of money, the coachbuilder was at\nlength induced to transfer my father's indentures to Allan Ramsay.\n\nIt was, of course, a great delight to my father to be removed to London\nunder such favourable auspices.  Ramsay had a large connection as a\nportrait painter.  His object in employing my father was that he should\nassist him in the execution of the subordinate parts, or dress\nportions, of portraits of courtiers, or of diplomatic personages.\nNo more favourable opportunity for advancement could have presented\nitself.  But all this was entirely due to my father's perseverance and\nadvancing skill as an artist--the results of his steady application\nand labour.\n\nRamsay possessed a very fine collection of drawings by the old masters,\nall of which were free for my father to study.  Ramsay was exceedingly\nkind to his young pupil.  He was present at all the discussions in the\nstudio, even when the sitters were present. Fellow-artists visited\nRamsay from time to time.  Among them was his intimate friend Philip\nReinagle--an agreeable companion, and an excellent artist.  Reinagle\nwas one day so much struck with my father's earnestness in filling up\nsome work, that he then and there got up a canvas and made a capital\nsketch-portrait of him in oil.  It only came into my father's\npossession some years after Ramsay's death, and is now in my possession.\n\n[Image]  Alexander Nasmyth.  After Reinagle's Portrait\n\nAmong the many amusing recollections of my father's life in London,\nthere is one that I cannot resist narrating, because it shows his\nfaculty of resourcefulness--a faculty which served him very usefully\nduring his course through life.  He had made an engagement with a\nsweetheart to take her to Ranelagh, one of the most fashionable places\nof public amusement in London.  Everybody went in full dress, and the\nbucks and swells wore long striped silk stockings.  My father, on\nsearching, found that he had only one pair of silk stockings left.\nHe washed them himself in his lodging-room, and hung them up before the\nfire to dry.  When he went to look at them, they were so singed and\nburnt that he could not put them on. They were totally useless.\nIn this sad dilemma his resourcefulness came to his aid.  The happy\nidea occurred to him of painting his legs so as to resemble stockings.\nHe went to his water-colour box, and dexterously painted them with\nblack and white stripes.  When the paint dried, which it soon did,\nhe completed his toilet, met his sweetheart and went to Ranelagh.\nNo one observed the difference, except, indeed, that he was\ncomplimented on the perfection of the fit, and was asked \"where he\nbought his stockings?\"  Of course he evaded the question, and left the\ngardens without any one discovering his artistic trick.\n\nMy father remained in Allan Ramsay's service until the end of 1778,\nwhen he returned to Edinburgh to practise on his own behalf the\nprofession of portrait painter.  He took with him the kindest\ngood-wishes of his master, whose friendship he retained to the end of\nRamsay's life.  The artistic style of my father's portraits, and the\nexcellent likenesses of his sitters, soon obtained for him ample\nemployment.  His portraits were for the most part full-lengths, but of\na small or cabinet size.  They generally consisted of family groups,\nwith the figures about twelve to fourteen inches high.  The groups were\ngenerally treated and arranged as if the personages were engaged in\nconversation with their children; and sometimes a favourite servant was\nintroduced, so as to remove any formal aspect in the composition of the\npicture.  In order to enliven the background, some favourite view from\nthe garden or grounds, or a landscape, was given; which was painted\nwith as much care as if it was the main feature of the picture.\nMany of these paintings are still to be found in the houses of the\ngentry in Scotland.  Good examples of his art are to be seen at Minto\nHouse, the seat of the Earl of Minto, and at Dalmeny Park, the seat of\nthe Earl of Rosebery.\n\nAmong my father's early employers was Patrick Miller, Esq., of\nDalswinton, in Dumfriesshire.  He painted Mr. Miller's portrait as\nwell as those of several members of his family.  This intercourse\neventually led to the establishment of a very warm personal friendship\nbetween them.  Miller had made a large fortune in Edinburgh as a\nbanker; and after he had partially retired from business, he devoted\nmuch of his spare time to useful purposes.  He was a man of great\nenergy of character, and was never idle.  At first he applied himself\nto the improvement of agriculture, which he did with great success on\nhis estate of Dalswinton.  Being one of the largest shareholders in the\nCarron Ironworks near Stirling, he also devoted much of his time to the\nimprovement of guns for the Royal Navy.  He was the inventor of that\nfamous gun the Carronade.  The handiness of these short and effective\nguns, which were capable of being loaded and fired nearly twice as\nquickly as the long small-bore guns, gave England the victory in many a\nnaval battle, where the firing was close and quick, yardarm to yardarm.\n\nBut Mr. Miller's greatest claim to fame arises from his endeavours to\nintroduce steam-power as an agent in the propulsion of ships at sea.\nMr. Clerk of Eldin had already invented the system of \"breaking the\nline\" in naval engagements--a system that was first practised with\ncomplete success by Lord Rodney in his engagement off Martinico in\n1780.  The subject interested Mr. Miller so much that he set himself\nto work to contrive some mechanical method by means of which ships of\nwar might be set in motion, independently of wind, tide, or calms, so\nthat Clerk's system of breaking the line might be carried into effect\nunder all circumstances.\n\nIt was about this time that my father was often with Miller; and the\nmechanical devices by means of which the method of breaking the line\ncould be best accomplished was the subject of many of their\nconversations.  Miller found that my father's taste for mechanical\ncontrivances, and his ready skill as a draughtsman, were likely to be\nof much use to him, and he constantly visited the studio.  My father\nreduced Miller's ideas to a definite form, and prepared a series of\ndrawings, which were afterwards engraved and published.  Miller's\nfavourite design was, to divide the vessel into twin or triple hulls,\nwith paddles between them, to be worked by the crew.  The principal\nexperiment was made in the Firth of Forth on the 2d of June 1787.\nThe vessel was double-hulled, and was worked by a capstan of five bars.\nThe experiment was on the whole successful.  But the chief difficulty\nwas in the propulsive power.  After a spurt of an hour or so, the men\nbecame tired with their laborious work.  Mr. Taylor, student of\ndivinity, and tutor of Mr. Miller's sons, was on board, and seeing the\nexhausted state of the men at the capstan, suggested the employment of\nsteam-power.  Mr. Miller was pleased with the idea, and resolved to\nmake inquiry upon the subject.\n\nAt that time William Symington, a young engineer from Wanlockhead,\nwas exhibiting a road locomotive in Edinburgh.  He was a friend of\nTaylor's, and Mr. Miller went to see the Symington model.  In the\ncourse of his conversation with the inventor, he informed the latter of\nhis own project, and described the difficulty he had experienced in\ngetting his paddle-wheels turned round.  On which Symington immediately\nasked, \"Why don't you use the steam-engine?\" The model which Symington\nexhibited, produced rotary motion by the employment of ratchet-wheels.\nThe rectilinear motion of the piston-rod was thus converted into rotary\nmotion.  Mr. Miller was pleased with the action of the ratchet-wheel\ncontrivance, and gave Symington an order to make a pair of engines of\nthat construction.  They were to be used on a small pleasure-boat on\nDalswinton Lake.\n\nThe boat was constructed on the double-hull or twin plan, so that the\npaddle should be used in the space between the hulls.*\n [footnote...\n This steam twin boat was in fact the progenitor of the Castalia,\nconstructed about a hundred years later for the conveyance of\npassengers between Calais and Dover.\n ...]\n\nAfter much vexatious delay, arising from the entire novelty of the\nexperiment, the boat and engines were at length completed, and removed\nto Dalswinton Lake.  This, the first steamer that ever \"trod the waters\nlike a thing of life,\" the herald of a new and mighty power, was tried\non the 14th of October 1788.  The vessel steamed delightfully, at the\nrate of from four to five miles an hour, though this was not her\nextreme rate of speed.  I give, on the next page, a copy of a sketch\nmade by my father of this the first actual steamboat, with her\nremarkable crew.\n\n[Image]  The first steamboat.  By Alexander Nasmyth*\n [footnote...\nThe original drawing of the steamer was done by my father, and lent by\nme to Mr. Woodcroft, Who inserted it in his Origin and Progress of\nSteam Navigation.  He omitted my father's name, and inserted only that\nof the lithographer, although it is a document of almost national\nimportance in the history of Steam Navigation.\n\nP.S.-- since the above paragraph was written for the first edition,\nI have been enabled to find the drawing, with another remarkable pencil\nsketch of my father's, in the Gallery of the Museum of Naval\nArchitecture at South Kensington.  It will henceforward belong to that\ninteresting collection.\n\nThe remarkable pencil sketch to which I have referred, is that of a\nscrew propeller, drawn by my father, dated 1819.  It was the result of\nmany discussions as to the proper mode of propelling a vessel.  First,\nhe had drawn Watt's idea of a \"spiral oar\"; then, underneath, he has\ndrawn his own idea, of a disk of six.  blades, like a screw-jack,\nimmediately behind the rudder.  There is a crank shown on the screw\nshaft, by which the propeller was driven direct, showing that he was\nthe first to indicate that method of propulsion of steamboats.\n ...]\n\nThe persons on board consisted of Patrick Miller, William Symington,\nSir William Monteith, Robert Burns (the poet, then a tenant of\nMr. Miller's), William Taylor, and Alexander Nasmyth.  There were also\nthree of Mr. Miller's servants, who acted as assistants.  On the edge\nof the lake was a young gentleman, then on a visit to Dalswinton.\nHe was no less a person than Henry Brougham, afterwards Lord Chancellor\nof England.  The assemblage of so many remarkable men was well worthy\nof the occasion.\n\nTaking into account the extraordinary results which have issued from\nthis first trial of an actual steamboat, it may well be considered that\nthis was one of the most important circumstances which ever occurred in\nthe history of navigation.  It ought, at the same time, to be\nremembered that all that was afterwards done by Symington, Fulton, and\nBell, followed long after the performance of this ever-memorable\nachievement.\n\nI may also mention, as worthy of special record, that the hull of this\nfirst steamboat was of iron.  It was constructed of tinned iron plate.\nIt was therefore the first iron steamboat, if not the first iron ship,\nthat had ever been made.  I may also add that the engines, constructed\nby Symington, which propelled this first iron steamboat are now\ncarefully preserved at the Patent Museum at South Kensington, where\nthey may be seen by everybody.*\n [footnote...\n The original engines of the boat, with the ratchet-wheel contrivance\nof Symington, are there: the very engine that propelled the first\nsteamer on Dalswinton Lake. It may be added that Mr. Miller expended\nabout #30,000 on naval improvements, and, as is often the case, he was\nwholly neglected by the Government.\n ...]\n\nTo return to my father's profession as a portrait painter.  He had\ngiven so much assistance to Mr. Miller, while acting as his chief\ndraughtsman in connection with the triple and twin ships, and also\nwhile attending him at Leith and elsewhere, that it had considerably\ninterfered with his practice; though everything was done by him con\namore, in the best sense of the term.  In return for this, however,\nMr. Miller made my father the generous offer of a loan to enable him to\nvisit Italy, and pursue his studies there.  It was the most graceful\nmode in which Mr. Miller could express his obligations.  It was an\noffer pure and simple, without security, and as such was thankfully\naccepted by my father.\n\nIn those days an artist was scarcely considered to have completed his\neducation until he had studied the works of the great masters at\nFlorence and Rome.  My father left England for Italy on the 30th of\nDecember 1782.  He reached Rome in safety, and earnestly devoted\nhimself to the study of art.  He remained in Italy for the greater part\nof two years.  He visited Florence, Bologna, Padua, and other cities\nwhere the finest artistic works were to be found.  He made studies and\ndrawings of the best of them, besides making sketches from nature of\nthe most remarkable places he had visited.  He returned to Edinburgh at\nthe end of 1784, and immediately resumed his profession of a portrait\npainter.  He was so successful that in a short time he was enabled to\nrepay his excellent friend Miller the #500 which he had so generously\nlent him a few years before.\n\nThe satisfactory results of his zealous practice, and of his skill and\nindustry in his profession, together with the prospect of increasing\nartistic work, enabled him to bring to a happy conclusion an engagement\nhe had entered into before leaving Edinburgh for Italy. I mean his\nmarriage to my mother--one of the greatest events of his life which\ntook place on the 3rd of January 1786.  Barbara Foulis was a distant\nrelation of his own.  She was the daughter of William Foulis, Esq., of\nWoodhall and Colinton, near Edinburgh.  Her brother, the late Sir James\nFoulis, my uncle, succeeded to the ancient baronetcy of the family.\nSee Burkes's Peerage and Baronetage*\n [footnote...\nIn Burke's Peerage and Baronetage an account is given of the Foulis\nfamily.  They are of Norman origin.  A branch settled in Scotland in\nthe reign of Malcolm Canmore.  By various intermarriages, the Foulises\nare connected with the Hopetoun, Bute, and Rosebery families.\nThe present holder of the title represents the houses of Colinton,\nWoodhall, and Ravelstone.\n ...]\n\nMy mother did not bring with her any fortune, so to speak, in the way\nof gold or acres; but she brought something far better into my father's\nhome,--a sweetness of disposition, and a large measure of common\nsense, which made her, in all respects, the devoted helpmate of her\nhusband.  Her happy cheerful temperament, and her constant industry and\nattention, shed an influence upon all around her.  By her example she\ninbred in her children the love of truth, excellence, and goodness.\nThat was indeed the best fortune she could bring into a good man's\nhome.\n\nDuring the first year of my father's married life, when he lived in\nSt. James's Square, he painted the well-known portrait of Robert Burns\nthe poet.  Burns had been introduced to him by Mr. Miller at\nDalswinton.  An intimate friendship sprang up between the artist and\nthe poet.  The love of nature and of natural objects was common to\nboth.  They also warmly sympathised in their political views.\nWhen Burns visited Edinburgh my father often met him.  Burns had a\nstrange aversion to sit for his portrait, though often urgently\nrequested to do so.  But when at my father's studio, Burns at last\nconsented, and his portrait was rapidly painted.  It was done in the\ncourse of a few hours, and my father made a present of it to\nMrs. Burns.\n\nA mezzotint engraving of it was afterwards published by William Walker,\nson-in-law of the famous Samuel Reynolds.  When the first proof\nimpression was submitted to my father, he said to Mr. Walker:\n\"I cannot better express to you my opinion of your admirable engraving,\nthan by telling you that it conveys to me a more true and lively\nremembrance of Burns than my own picture of him does; it so perfectly\nrenders the spirit of his expression, as well as the details of his\nevery feature.\"\n\nWhile Burns was in Edinburgh, my father had many interesting walks with\nhim in the neighbourhood of the city.  The Calton Hill, Arthur's Seat,\nSalisbury Crags.  Habbie's How, and the nooks in the Pentlands, were\nalways full of interest; and Burns, with his brilliant and humorous\nconversation, made the miles very short as they strode along.  Lockhart\nsays, in his Life of Burns, that \"the magnificent scenery of the\nScottish capital filled the poet with extraordinary delight.  In the\nspring mornings he walked very often to the top of Arthur's Seat, and,\nlying prostrate on the turf, surveyed the rising of the sun out of the\nsea in silent admiration; his chosen companion on such occasions being\nthat learned artist and ardent lover of nature, Alexander Nasmyth.\"\n\nA visit which the two paid to Roslin Castle is worthy of commemoration.\nOn one occasion my father and a few choice spirits had been spending a\n\"nicht wi' Burns.\"  The place of resort was a tavern in the High Street,\nEdinburgh.  As Burns was a brilliant talker, full of spirit and humour,\ntime fled until the \"wee sma' hours ayont the twal'\" arrived.\nThe party broke up about three o'clock.  At that time of the year\n(the 13th of June) the night is very short, and morning comes early.\nBurns, on reaching the street, looked up to the sky.  It was perfectly\nclear, and the rising sun was beginning to brighten the mural crown of\nSt. Giles's Cathedral.\n\nBurns was so much struck with the beauty of the morning that he put his\nhand on my father's arm and said, \"It'll never do to go to bed in such\na lovely morning as this!  Let's awa' to Roslin Castle.\"  No sooner said\nthan done.  The poet and the painter set out.  Nature lay bright and\nlovely before them in that delicious summer morning.  After an\neight-miles walk they reached the castle at Roslin.  Burns went down\nunder the great Norman arch, where he stood rapt in speechless\nadmiration of the scene.  The thought of the eternal renewal of youth\nand freshness of nature, contrasted with the crumbling decay of man's\nefforts to perpetuate his work, even when founded upon a rock, as\nRoslin Castle is, seemed greatly to affect him.\n\nMy father was so much impressed with the scene that, while Burns was\nstanding under the arch, he took out his pencil and a scrap of paper\nand made a hasty sketch of the subject.  This sketch was highly\ntreasured by my father, in remembrance of what must have been one of\nthe most memorable days of his life.\n\nTalking of clubs reminds me that there was a good deal of club life in\nEdinburgh in those days.  The most notable were those in which the\nmembers were drawn together by occupations, habits, or tastes.  They\nmet in the evenings, and conversed upon congenial subjects.  The clubs\nwere generally held in one or other of the taverns situated in or near\nthe High Street.  Every one will remember the Lawyers' Club, held in an\nEdinburgh close, presided over by Pleydell, so well described by Scott\nin Guy Mannering.\n\nIn my father's early days he was a member of a very jovial club, called\nthe Poker Club.  It was so-called because the first chairman,\nimmediately on his election, in a spirit of drollery, laid hold of the\npoker at the fireplace, and adopted it as his insignia of office. He\nmade a humorous address from the chair, or \"the throne,\" as he called\nit, with sceptre or poker in hand; and the club was thereupon styled by\nacclamation \"The Poker Club.\"  I have seen my father's diploma of\nmembership; it was tastefully drawn on parchment, with the poker duly\nemblazoned on it as the regalia of the club.\n\nIn my own time, the club that he was most connected with was the\nDilettanti Club.  Its meetings were held every fortnight, on Thursday\nevenings, in a commodious tavern in the High Street.  The members were\nchiefly artists, or men known for their love of art.  Among then were\nHenry Raeburn, Hugh Williams (the Grecian), Andrew Geddes,\nWilliam Thomson, John Shetkay, William Nicholson, William Allan,\nAlexander Nasmyth, the Rev. John Thomson of Duddingston,\nGeorge Thomson, Sir Walter Scott, John Lockhart, Dr. Brewster,\nDavid Wilkie, Henry Cockburn, Francis Jeffrey, John A. Murray,\nProfessor Wilson, John Ballantyne, James Ballantyne, James Hogg (the\nEttrick Shepherd), and David Bridges, the secretary.*\n [footnote...\nDavie Bridges was a character.  In my early days he was a cloth\nmerchant in the High Street.  His shop was very near that gigantic\nlounge, the old Parliament House, and was often resorted to by\nnon-business visitors.  Bridges had a good taste for pictures.  He had\na small but choice collection by the Old Masters, which he kept\narranged in the warehouse under his shop.  He took great pride in\nexhibiting them to his visitors, and expatiating upon their excellence.\nI remember being present in his warehouse with my father when a very\nbeautiful small picture by Richard Wilson was under review.  Davie\nburst out emphatically with, \"Eh, man, did ye ever see such glorious\nbuttery touches as on these clouds!\"  His joking friends clubbed him\n\"Director-General of the Fine Arts for Scotland,\" a title which he\ncomplacently accepted.  Besides showing off his pictures, Davie was an\nart critic, and wrote articles for the newspapers and magazines.\nUnfortunately, however, his attention to pictures prevented him from\nattending to his shop, and his customers (who were not artists) forsook\nhim, and bought their clothes elsewhere.  He accordingly shut up his\nshop, and devoted himself to art criticism, in which, for a time, he\npossessed a monopoly.\n ...]\n\nThe drinks were restricted to Edinburgh ale and whisky toddy.\n\nAn admirable picture of the club in full meeting was painted by William\nAllan, in which characteristic portraits of all the leading members\nwere introduced in full social converse.  Among the more prominent\nportraits is one of my father, who is represented as illustrating some\nsubject he is describing, by drawing it on the part of the table before\nhim, with his finger dipped in toddy.  Other marked and well-known\ncharacteristics of the members are skilfully introduced in the picture.\nThe artist afterwards sold it to Mr. Horrocks of Preston, in Lancashire.\n\nBesides portrait painting, my father was much employed in assisting the\nnoblemen and landed gentry of Scotland in improving the landscape\nappearance of their estates, especially when seen from their mansion\nwindows.  His fine taste, and his love of natural scenery, gave him\ngreat advantages in this respect.  He selected the finest sites for the\nnew mansions, when they were erected in lieu of the old towers and\ncrenellated castles.  Or, he designed alterations of the old buildings\nso as to preserve their romantic features, and at the same time to fit\nthem for the requirements of modern domestic life.\n\nIn those early days of art-knowledge, there scarcely existed any\nartistic feeling for the landscape beauty of nature.  There was an\nutter want of appreciation of the dignified beauty of the old castles\nand mansions, the remnants of which were in too many instances carted\naway as material for now buildings.  There was also at that time an\nutter ignorance of the beauty and majesty of old trees.  A forest of\nvenerable oaks or beeches was a thing to be done away with.  They were\nmerely cut down as useless timber; even when they so finely embellished\nthe landscape.  My father exerted himself successfully to preserve\nthese grand old forest trees.  His fine sketches served to open the\neyes of their possessors to the priceless treasures they were about to\ndestroy; and he thus preserved the existence of many a picturesque old\ntree.  He even took the pains in many cases to model the part of the\nestate he was dealing with; and he also modelled the old trees he\nwished to preserve.  Thus, by a judicious clearing out of the\nintercepting young timber, he opened out distant views of the\nlandscape, and at the same time preserved many a monarch of the\nforest.*\n [footnote...\nIt is even now to be deeply deplored that those who inherit or come\ninto possession of landed estates do not feel sufficiently impressed\nwith the possession of such grand memorials of the past.  Alas! how\noften have we to lament the want of taste that leads to the sacrifice\nof these venerable treasures.  Would that the young men at our\nuniversities especially those likely to inherit estates--were\nimpressed with the importance of preserving them. They would thus\nconfer an inestimable benefit to thousands.  About forty years ago Lord\nCockburn published a pamphlet on How to Destroy the Beauty of\nEdinburgh!  He enforced the charm of green foliage in combination with\nstreet architecture.  The burgesses were then cutting down trees.\nHis lordship went so far as to say \"that he would as soon cut down a\nburgess as a tree!\"  Since then the growth of trees in Edinburgh,\nespecially in what was once the North Loch, has been greatly improved;\nand might be still further improved if that famous tree, \"The London\nplane,\" were employed.\n ...]\n\n[Image]  The Family Tree\n\nMy father modelled old castles, old trees, and such like objects as he\nwished to introduce into his landscapes.  The above illustration, may\nperhaps give a slight idea of his artistic skill as a modeller.\nI specially refer to this, which he called \"The Family Tree,\" as he\nrequired each member of his family to assist in its production.\nWe each made a twig or small branch, which he cleverly fixed into its\nplace as a part of the whole.  The model tree in question was\nconstructed of wire slightly twisted together, so as to form the main\nbody of a branch.  It was then subdivided into branchlets, and finally\ninto individual twigs.  All these, combined together by his dexterous\nhand, resulted in the model of an old leafless tree, so true and\ncorrect, that any one would have thought that it had been modelled\ndirect from nature.\n\nThe Duke of Athol consulted my father as to the improvements which he\ndesired to make in his woodland scenery near Dunkeld.  The Duke was\ndesirous that a rocky crag, called Craigybarns, should be planted with\ntrees, to relieve the grim barrenness of its appearance.  But it was\nimpossible for any man to climb the crag in order to set seeds or\nplants in the clefts of the rocks.  A happy idea struck my father.\nHaving observed in front of the castle a pair of small cannon used for\nfiring salutes, it occurred to him to turn them to account.  His object\nwas to deposit the seeds of the various trees amongst the soil in the\nclefts of the crag.  A tinsmith in the village was ordered to make a\nnumber of canisters with covers.  The canisters were filled with all\nsorts of suitable tree seeds.  A cannon was loaded, and the canisters\nwere fired up against the high face of the rock.  They burst and\nscattered the seed in all directions.  Some years after, when my father\nrevisited the place, he was delighted to find that his scheme of\nplanting by artillery had proved completely successful; for the trees\nwere flourishing luxuriantly in all the recesses of the cliff. This was\nanother instance of my father's happy faculty of resourcefulness.\n\nCertain circumstances about this time compelled my father almost\nentirely to give up portrait painting and betake himself to another\nbranch of the fine arts.  The earnest and lively interest which he took\nin the state of public affairs, and the necessity which then existed\nfor reforming the glaring abuses of the State, led him to speak out his\nmind freely on the subject.  Edinburgh was then under the reign of the\nDundases; and scarcely anybody dared to mutter his objections to\nanything perpetrated by the \"powers that be.\"  The city was then a much\nsmaller place than it is now.  There was more gossip, and perhaps more\nespionage, among the better classes, who were few in number.  At all\nevents, my father's frank opinions on political subjects began to be\nknown.  He attended Fox dinners.  He was intimate with men of known\nreforming views.  All this was made the subject of general talk.\nAccordingly, my father received many hints from aristocratic and\nwealthy personages, that \"if this went on any longer they would\nwithdraw from him their employment.\"  My father did not alter his\ncourse; it was right and honest.  But he suffered nevertheless.\nHis income from portrait painting fell off rapidly.\n\nAt length he devoted himself to landscape painting.  It was a freer and\nmore enjoyable life.  Instead of painting the faces of those who were\nperhaps without character or attractiveness, he painted the fresh and\never-beautiful face of nature.  The field of his employment in this\nrespect was almost inexhaustible.  His artistic talent in this\ndelightful branch of art was in the highest sense congenial to his mind\nand feelings; and in course of time the results of his new field of\noccupation proved thoroughly satisfactory.  In fact, men of the highest\nrank with justice entitled him the \"Father of landscape painting in\nScotland.\"\n\n[Image]  No.  47 York Place, Edinburgh\n\nAt the same time, when changing his branch of art, he opened a class in\nhis own house forgiving practical instruction in the art of landscape\npainting.  He removed his house and studio from St. James's Square to\nNo. 47 York Place.  There was at the upper part of this house a noble\nand commodious room.  There he held his class.  The house was his own,\nand was built after his own designs.  A splendid prospect was seen from\nthe upper windows; and especially from the Belvidere, which he had\nconstructed on the summit of the roof.  The view extended from Stirling\nin the west to the Bass Rock in the east.  In fine summer evenings the\nsun was often seen setting behind Ben Lomond and the more conspicuous\nof the Perthshire mountains.\n\nMy father did not confine himself to landscape painting, or to the\ninstruction of his classes.  He was an all-round man.  He had something\nof the Universal about him.  He was a painter, an architect, and a\nmechanic.  Above all, he possessed a powerful store of common sense.\nOf course, I am naturally a partial judge of my father's character; but\nthis I may say, that during my experience of over seventy years I have\nnever known a more incessantly industrious man.  His hand and mind were\nalways at work from morn till night.  During the time that he was\nlosing his business in portrait painting, he set to work and painted\nscenery for the theatres.  The late David Roberts--himself a scene\npainter of the highest character--said that his style was founded\nupon that of Nasmyth.*\n [footnote...\nDavid Roberts, R,A., in his Autobiography, gives the following\nrecollections of Alexander Nasmyth: -- \"In 1819 I commenced my career as\nprincipal scene painter in the Theatre Royal, Glasgow.  This theatre\nwas immense in its size and appointments--in magnitude exceeding\nDrury Lane and Covent Garden. The stock scenery had been painted by\nAlexander Nasmyth, and consisted of a series of pictures far surpassing\nanything of the kind I had ever seen.  These included chambers,\npalaces, streets, landscapes, and forest scenery.  One, I remember\nparticularly, was the outside of a Norman castle, and another of a\ncottage charmingly painted, and of which I have a sketch.  But the act\nscene, which was a view on the Clyde looking towards the Highland\nmountains with Dumbarton Castle in the middle distance, was such a\ncombination of magnificent scenery, so wonderfully painted, that it\nexcited universal admiration.  These productions I studied incessantly;\nand on them my style, if I have any, was originally founded.\"\n ...]\n\nStanfield was another of his friends.  On one occasion Stanfield showed\nhim his sketch-book, observing that he wished to form a style of his\nown.  \"Young man,\" said Nasmyth, \"there's but one style an artist\nshould endeavour to attain, and that is the style of nature; the nearer\nyou can get to that the better.\"\n\nMy father was greatly interested in the architectural beauty of his\nnative city, and he was professionally consulted by the authorities\nabout the laying out of the streets of the New Town.  The subject\noccupied much of his time and thought, especially when resting from the\nmental fatigue arising from a long sitting at the easel.  It was his\nregular practice to stroll about where the building work was in\nprogress, or where new roads were being laid out, and carefully watch\nthe proceedings.  This was probably due to the taste which he had\ninherited from his forebears--more especially from his father, who\nhad begun the buildings of the New Town.  My father took pleasure in\nmodelling any improvement that occurred to him; and in discussing the\nsubject with the architects and builders who were professionally\nengaged in the works.  His admirable knack of modelling the contour of\nthe natural surface of the ground, and applying it to the proposed new\nroads or new buildings, was striking and characteristic.  His efforts\nin this direction were so thoroughly disinterested that those in office\nwere all the more anxious to carry out his views.  He sought for no\nreward; but his excellent advice was not unrecognised.  In testimony of\nthe regard which the Magistrates of Edinburgh had for his counsel and\nservices, they presented him in 1815 with a sum of #200, together with\na most complimentary letter acknowledging the value of his\ndisinterested advice.  It was addressed to him under cover, directed to\n\"Alexander Nasmyth, Architect.\"\n\nHe was, indeed, not unworthy of the name.  He was the architect of the\nDean Bridge, which spans the deep valley of the Water of Leith,\nnorth-west of the New Town.  Sir John Nesbit, the owner of the property\nnorth of the stream, employed my father to make a design for the\nextension of the city to his estate.  The result was the construction\nof the Dean Bridge, and the roads approaching it from both sides.\nThe Dean Estate was thus rendered as easy and convenient to reach as\nany of the level streets of Edinburgh.  The construction of the bridge\nwas superintended by the late James Jardine, C.E. Mr Telford was\nafterwards called upon to widen the bridge.  He threw out parapets on\neach side, but they did not improve the original design.\n\n[Image]  St Bernard's Well\n\nFrom the Dean Bridge another of my father's architectural buildings may\nbe seen, at St. Bernard's Well.  It was constructed at the instance of\nhis friend Lord Gardenstone.  The design consists of a graceful\ncircular temple, built over a spring of mineral water, which issues\nfrom the rock below.  It was dedicated to Hygeia, the Goddess of\nHealth.  The whole of the details are beautifully finished, and the\nbasement of the design will be admired by every true artist.  It is\nregarded as a great ornament, and is thoroughly in keeping with the\nbeauty of the surrounding scenery.\n\nShortly after the death of Lord Nelson it was proposed to erect a\nmonument to his memory on the Calton Hill.  My father supplied a\ndesign, which was laid before the Monument Committee.  It was so much\napproved that the required sum was rapidly subscribed.  But as the\nestimated cost of this erection was found slightly to exceed the amount\nsubscribed, a nominally cheaper design was privately adopted. It was\nliterally a job.  The vulgar, churn-like monument was thus thrust on\nthe public and actually erected; and there it stands to this day, a\npiteous sight to beholders.  It was eventually found greatly to exceed\nin cost the amount of the estimate for my father's design.  I give a\nsketch of my father's memorial; and I am led to do this because it is\nerroneously alleged that he was the architect of the present inverted\nspy glass, called \"Nelson's Monument\"\n\n[Image]  Nelson's Monument as it should have been.\n\nThen, with respect to my father's powers as a mechanic.  This was an\ninherited faculty, and I leave my readers to infer from the following\npages whether I have not had my fair share of this inheritance. Besides\nhis painting room, my father had a workroom fitted up with all sorts of\nmechanical tools.  It was one of his greatest pleasures to occupy\nhimself there as a relief from sitting at the easel, or while within\ndoors from the inclemency of the weather.  The walls and shelves of his\nworkroom were crowded with a multitude of artistic and ingenious\nmechanical objects, nearly all of which were the production of his own\nhands.  Many of them were associated with the most eventful incidents\nin his life.  He only admitted his most intimate friends, or such as\ncould understand and appreciate the variety of objects connected with\nart and mechanism, to his workroom.  His natural taste for neatness and\narrangement gave it a very orderly aspect, however crowded its walls\nand shelves might be.  Everything was in its place, and there was a\nplace for everything.  It was in this workroom that I first began to\nhandle mechanical tools.  It was my primary technical school--the\nvery foreground of my life.\n\n[Image]  Bow-and-string Roofs and Bridges\n\nI may mention one or two of my father's mechanical efforts, or rather\nhis inventions in applied science.  One of the most important was the\n\"bow-and-string bridge,\" as he first called it, to which he early\ndirected his attention.  He invented this important method of\nconstruction about the year 1794.  The first bow-and-string bridge was\nerected in the island of St. Helena over a deep ravine.\n\nMany considered, from its apparent slightness, that it was not fitted\nto sustain any considerable load.  A remarkable and convincing proof\nwas, however, given of its stability by the passage over it of a herd\nof wild oxen, that rushed across without the slightest damage to its\nstructure.  After so severe a test it was for many succeeding years\nemployed as a most valuable addition to the accessibility of an\nimportant portion of the island.  The bow-and-string bridge has since\nbeen largely employed in spanning wide spaces over which suburban and\nother railways pass, and in roofing over such stations as those at\nBirmingham, Charing Cross, and other Great Metropolitan centres, as\nwell as in bow-and-string bridges over rivers.  I give the fac-simile\nof his original drawings*\n [footnote...\n The original drawings of these bow-and-string bridges, of various\nspans, are now deposited at the Gallery of the Museum of Naval\nArchitecture at South Kensington, and are signed \"Alexander Nasmyth\n1796.\"\n ...]\nfor the purpose of showing our great railway engineers the originator\nof the graceful and economical method of spanning wide spaces, now\npractised in every part of the civilised world.\n\nAnother of his inventions was the method of riveting by compression\ninstead of by blows of the hammer.  It originated in a slight\ncircumstance.  One wet, wintry Sunday morning he went into his\nworkroom.  There were some slight mechanical repairs to be performed\nupon a beautiful little stove of his own construction.  To repair it,\niron rivets were necessary to make it serviceable.  But as the\nhammering of the hot rivets would annoy his neighbours by the unwelcome\nsound of the hammer, he solved the difficulty by using the jaws of his\nbench vice to squeeze in the hot rivets when put into their places.\nThe stove was thus quickly repaired in the most perfect silence.\n\nThis was, perhaps, the first occasion on which a squeeze or compressive\naction was substituted for the percussive action of the hammer,\nin closing red-hot rivets, for combining together pieces of stout sheet\nor plate iron.  This system of riveting was long afterwards patented by\nSmith of Deanston in combination with William Fairbairn of Manchester;\nand it was employed in riveting the plates used in the construction of\nthe bridges over the River Conway and the Menai Straits.\n\nIt is also universally used in boiler and girder making, and in all\nother wrought-iron structures in which thorough sound riveting is\nabsolutely essential; and by the employment of hydraulic power in a\nportable form a considerable portion of iron shipbuilding is effected\nby the silent squeeze  system in place of hammers, much to the\nadvantage of the soundness of the work.  My father frequently,\nin aftertimes, practised this mode of riveting by compression in place\nof using the blow of a hammer; and in remembrance of the special\ncircumstances under which he contrived this silent and most effective\nmethod of riveting, he named it \"The Sunday Rivet.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER 3.   An Artist's Family.\n\nAlthough Alexander Nasmyth had to a considerable extent lost his\naristocratic connection as a portrait painter, yet many kind and\ngenerous friends gathered round him.  During his sojourn in Italy,\nin 1783, he had the good fortune to make the acquaintance of Sir James\nHall of Dunglass, Haddingtonshire.  The acquaintance afterwards ripened\ninto a deeply-rooted friendship.\n\nDuring the winter season Sir James resided with his family in his town\nhouse in George Street.  He was passionately attached to the pursuit of\nart and science.  He practised the art of painting in my father's room,\nand was greatly helped by him in the requisite manipulative skill.\nSir James was at that time engaged in writing his well-known essay\n\"On the Origin of Gothic Architecture,\" and in this my father was of\nimportant use to him.  He executed the greater number of the\nillustrations for this beautiful work.  The book when published had a\nconsiderable influence in restoring the taste of architects to a style\nwhich they had heretofore either neglected or degraded.\n\nBesides his enthusiasm in art and architecture, Sir James devoted a\ngreat deal of time to the study of geology.  The science was then in\nits infancy.  Being an acute observer, Hall's attention was first\nattracted to the subject by the singular geological features of the\nsea-coast near his mansion at Dunglass.  The neighbourhood of Edinburgh\nalso excited his interest.  The upheaval of the rocks by volcanic heat\n--as seen in the Castle Hill, the Calton Hill, and Arthur's Seat--\nformed in a great measure the foundation of the picturesque beauty of\nthe city.  Those were the days of the Wernerian and Huttonian\ncontroversy as to the origin of the changes on the surface of the\nearth.  Sir James Ball was President of the Edinburgh Royal Society,\nand necessarily took an anxious interest in the discussions.\nHe observed and experimented, and established the true volcanic nature\nof the composition and formation of the rocks and mountains which\nsurround Edinburgh.\n\nI have been led to speak of this subject, because when a boy I was\noften present at the discussions of these great principles.\nMy father, Sir James Hall, Professors Playfair and Leslie, took their\naccustomed walks round Edinburgh, and I clung eagerly to their words.\nThough unable to understand everything that was said, these walks had a\ngreat influence upon my education.  Indeed, what education can compare\nwith that of listening attentively to the conversation and interchange\nof thought of men of the highest intelligence?  It is on such occasions\nthat ideas, not mere words, take hold of the memory, and abide there\nuntil the close of life.\n\nBesides mixing in the society of scientific men, my father enjoyed a\nfriendly intercourse with the artists of his day.  He was often able to\ngive substantial help and assistance to young students; and he was most\nliberal in giving them valuable practical instruction, and in assisting\nthem over the manipulative difficulties which lay in their way.  He was\nespecially assiduous when he saw them inspired by the true spirit of\nart, and full of application and industry,--without which nothing can\nbe accomplished.  Amongst these young men were David Wilkie, Francis\nGrant, David Roberts, Clarkson Stanfield, William Allan, Andrew Geddes,\n\"Grecian\" Williams, Lizars the engraver, and the Rev. John Thomson of\nDuddingston.\n\nHenry Raeburn was one of his most intimate friends and companions.\nHe considered Raeburn's broad and masterly style of portrait painting\nas an era in Scottish art.  Raeburn, with innate tact, discerned the\ncharacter of his sitters, and he imparted so much of their\nindividuality into his portraits as to make them admirable likenesses\nin the highest sense.  In connection with Raeburn, I may mention that\nwhen he was knighted by George IV. in 1822, my father, who was then at\nthe head of his profession in Scotland, was appointed chairman at the\ndinner held to do honour to the great Scottish portrait painter.\n\nRaeburn often joined my father in his afternoon walks round Edinburgh\n--a relaxation so very desirable after hours of close attention to\nartistic work.  They took delight in the wonderful variety of\npicturesque scenery by which the city is surrounded.  The walks about\nArthur's Seat were the most enjoyable of all.  When a boy I had often\nthe pleasure of accompanying them, and of listening to their\nconversation.  I thus picked up many an idea that served me well in\nafter life.  Indeed, I may say, after a long experience, that there is\nno class of men whose company I more delight in than that of artists.\nTheir innate and highly-cultivated power of observation, not only as\nregards the ever-varying aspects of nature, but also as regards the\nquaint, droll, and humorous varieties of character, concur in rendering\ntheir conversation most delightful.  I look back on these walks as\namong the brightest points in my existence.  I have been led to digress\non this subject.  Although more correctly belonging to my father's\nlife, yet it is so amalgamated with my own that it almost forms part of\nit, and it is difficult for me to separate the one from the other.\n\nAnd then there were the pleasant evenings at home.  When the day's work\nwas over, friends looked in to have a fireside crack--sometimes\nscientific men, sometimes artists, often both.  They were all made\nwelcome.  There was no formality about their visits.  Had they been\nformal, there would have been comparatively little pleasure.\nThe visitor came in with his \"Good e'en\", and seated himself.\nThe family went on with their work as before.  The girls were usually\nbusy with their needles, and others with pen and pencil.  My father\nwould go on with the artistic work he had in hand, for his industry was\nincessant.  He would model a castle or a tree, or proceed with some\nproposed improvement of the streets or approaches of the rapidly\nexpanding city.  Among the most agreeable visitors were Professor\nLeslie, James Jardine, C.E., and Dr. Brewster.  Their conversation was\nspecially interesting.  They brought up the last new thing in science,\nin discovery, in history, or in campaigning, for the war was then\nraging throughout Europe.\n\nThe artists were a most welcome addition to the family group.\nMany a time did they set the table in a roar with their quaint and\ndroll delineations of character.  These unostentatious gatherings of\nfriends about our fireside were a delightful social institution.\nThe remembrance of them lights up my recollection of the happiest\nperiod of a generally happy life.  Could I have been able to set forth\nthe brightness and cheerfulness of these happy evenings at my father's\nhouse, I am fain to think that my description might have been well\nworth reading.  But all the record of them that remains is a most\ncherished recollection of their genial tone and harmony, which makes me\nthink that, although in these days of rapid transit over earth and\nocean, and surrounded as we are with the results of applied scientific\nknowledge, we are not a bit more happy than when all the vaunted\ntriumphs of science and so-called education were in embryo.\n\nThe supper usually followed, for my father would not allow his visitors\nto go away supperless.  The meal did not amount to much.  Rizard or\nFinnan harddies, or a dish of oysters, with a glass of Edinburgh ale,\nand a rummer of toddy, concluded these friendly evenings.  The cry of\n\"Caller Aou\" was constantly heard in the streets below of an evening.\nWhen the letter r was in the name of the month, the supply of oysters\nwas abundant.  The freshest oysters, of the most glorious quality, were\nto be had at 2s. 6d. the hundred!  And what could be more refreshing\nfood for my father's guests?  These unostentatious and inexpensive\ngatherings of friends were a most delightful social institution among\nthe best middle-class people of Edinburgh some sixty or seventy years\nago.  What they are now I cannot tell.  But I fear they have\ndisappeared in the more showy and costly tastes that have sprung up in\nthe progress of what is called \"modern society.\"\n\nNo part of my father's character was more admirable than his utter\nunselfishness.  He denied himself many things, that he might give the\ngreater pleasure to his wife and children.  He would scarcely take part\nin any enjoyment, unless they could have their fair share of it. In all\nthis he was faithfully followed by my mother.  The admirable example of\nwell-sustained industry that was always before her, sustained her in\nher efforts for the good of her family.  She was intelligently\ninterested in all that related to her husband's business and interests,\nas well as in his recreative enjoyments.  The household affairs were\nunder her skilful guidance.  She conducted them with economy, and yet\nwith generous liberality, free from the least taint of ostentation or\nextravagance.  The home fireside was a scene of cheerfulness.\nAnd most of our family have been blest with this sunny gift.  Indeed,\na merrier family circle I have never seen.  There were twelve persons\nround the table to be provided for, besides two servants.\nThis required, on my mother's part, a great deal of management,\nas every housekeeper will know.  Yet everything was provided and paid\nfor within the year's income.\n\nThe family result of my father and mother's happy marriage was four\nsons and seven daughters.  Patrick, the eldest, was born in 1787.\nHe was called after my father's dear and constant friend, Patrick\nMiller of Dalswinton.  I will speak by and by of his artistic\nreputation.  Then followed a long succession of daughters--\nJane, the eldest', was born in 1788; Barbara 1790; Margaret in 1791;\nElizabeth in 1793; Anne in 1798; Charlotte in 1804.\nThen came a succession of three sons--Alexander, George,and James.\nThere followed another daughter, Mary; but as she only lived for about\neighteen months, I remained the youngest of the family.\n\nMy sisters all possessed, in a greater or less degree, an innate love\nof art, and by their diligent application they acquired the practice of\npainting landscape in oils.  My father's admirable system and method of\nteaching rendered them expert in making accurate sketches from nature,\nwhich, as will afterwards be seen, they turned to good account.\nMy eldest sister, Jane, was in all respects a most estimable character,\nand a great help to my mother in the upbringing of the children.\nJane was full of sound common sense; her judgment seemed to be beyond\nher years.  Because of this the younger members of the family jokingly\nnicknamed her \"Old Solid\"!--Even my father consulted her in every\ncase of importance in reference to domestic and financial affairs.\nI had the great good fortune, when a child, to be placed under her\nspecial protection, and I have reason to be thankful for the\naffectionate care which she took of me during the first six years of\nmy life.\n\nBesides their early education in art, my mother was equally earnest in\nher desire to give her daughters a thorough practical knowledge in\nevery department and detail of household management.  When they had\nattained a suitable age they were in succession put in charge of all\nthe household duties for two weeks at a time.  The keys were given over\nto them, together with the household books, and at the end of their\ntime their books were balanced to a farthing.  They were then passed on\nto the next in succession.  One of the most important branches of\nfemale education--the management of the domestic affairs of a family,\nthe superintendence of the cooking so as to avoid waste of food, the\nregularity of the meals, and the general cleaning up of the rooms--\nwas thus thoroughly attained in its best and most practical forms.\nAnd under the admirable superintendence of my mother everything in our\nfamily went on like clockwork.\n\nMy father's object was to render each and all of his children--\nwhether boys or girls--independent on their arrival at mature years.\nAccordingly, he sedulously kept up the attention of his daughters to\nfine art.  By this means he enabled them to assist in the maintenance\nof the family while at home, and afterwards to maintain themselves by\nthe exercise of their own abilities and industry after they had left.\nTo accomplish this object, as already described, he set on foot drawing\nclasses, which were managed by his six daughters, superintended by\nhimself.\n\nEdinburgh was at that time the resort of many county families.\nThe war which raged abroad prevented their going to the Continent.\nThey therefore remained at home, and the Scotch families for the most\npart took up their residence in Edinburgh.  There were many young\nladies desiring to complete their accomplishments, and hence the\nestablishment of my sisters' art class.  It was held in the large\npainting-room in the upper part of the house.  It soon became one of\nthe most successful institutions in Edinburgh.  When not engaged in\ndrawing and oil painting, the young ladies were occupied in sketching\nfrom nature, under the superintendence of my sisters, in the outskirts\nof Edinburgh.  This was one of the most delightful exercises in which\nthey could be engaged; and it also formed the foundation for many\nfriendships which only terminated with life.\n\nMy father increased the interest of the classes by giving little art\nlectures.  They were familiar but practical.  He never gave lectures as\nsuch, but rather demonstrations.  It was only when a pupil encountered\nsome technical difficulty, or was adopting some wrong method of\nproceeding, that he undertook to guide them by his words and practical\nillustrations.  His object was to embue the minds of the pupils with\nhigh principles of art.  He would take up their brushes and show by his\ndexterous and effective touches how to bring out, with marvellous ease,\nthe right effects of the landscape.  The other pupils would come and\nstand behind him, to see and hear his clear instructions carried into\nactual practice on the work before him.  He often illustrated his\nlittle special lessons by his stores of instructive and interesting\nanecdotes, which no doubt helped to rivet his practice all the deeper\ninto their minds.  Thus the Nasmyth classes soon became the fashion.\nIn many cases both mothers and daughters might be seen at work together\nin that delightful painting-room.  I have occasionally met with some of\nthem in after years, who referred to those pleasant hours as among the\nmost delightful they had ever spent.\n\nThese classes were continued for many years.  In the meantime my\nsisters' diligence and constant practice enabled them in course of time\nto exhibit their works in the fine art exhibitions of Edinburgh.\nEach had her own individuality of style and manner, by which their\nseveral works were easily distinguished from each other.  Indeed,\nwhoever works after Nature will have a style of their own.  They all\ncontinued the practice of oil painting until an advanced age.\nThe average duration of their lives was about seventy-eight.\n\nThere was one point which my father diligently impressed upon his\npupils, and that was the felicity and the happiness attendant upon\npencil drawing.  He was a master of the pencil, and in his off-hand\nsketches communicated his ideas to others in a way that mere words\ncould never have done.  It was his Graphic Language.  A few strokes of\nthe pencil can convey ideas which quires of writing would fail to\nimpart.  This is one of the most valuable gifts which a man who has to\ndo with practical subjects can possess.  \"The language of the pencil\"\nis a truly universal one, especially in communicating ideas which have\nreference to material forms.  And yet it is in a great measure\nneglected in our modern system of education.\n\nThe language of the tongue is often used to disguise our thoughts,\nwhereas the language of the pencil is clear and explicit.  Who that\npossesses this language can fail to look back with pleasure on the\ncourse of a journey illustrated by pencil drawings?  They bring back to\nyou the landscapes you have seen, the old streets, the pointed gables,\nthe entrances to the old churches, even the bits of tracery, with a\nvividness of association such as mere words could never convey.\nThus, looking at an old sketch-book brings back to you the recollection\nof a tour, however varied, and you virtually make the journey over\nagain with its picturesque and beautiful associations.  On many a fine\nsummer's day did my sisters make a picnic excursion into the\nneighbourhood of Edinburgh.  They were accompanied by their pupils,\nsketch-book and pencil in hand.  As I have already said, there is no\nsuch scenery near any city that I know of.  Arthur's Seat and Salisbury\nCrags, Duddingston Loch, the Braid Hills, Craigmillar Castle,\nHawthornden, Roslin, Habbie's How, and the many valleys and rifts in\nthe Pentlands, with Edinburgh and its Castle in the distance; or the\nscenery by the sea-shore, all round the coast from Newhaven to Gullane\nand North Berwick Law.\n\nThe excursionists came home laden with sketches.  I have still by me a\nmultitude of these graphic records made by my sisters.  Each sketch,\nhowever slight, strikes the keynote, as it were, to many happy\nrecollections of the circumstances, and the persons who were present at\nthe time it was made.  I know not of any such effective stimulant to\nthe recollection of past events as these graphic memoranda.\nWritten words may be forgotten, but these slight pencil recollections\nimprint themselves on the mind with a force that can never be effaced.\nEverything that occurred at the time rises up as fresh in the memory as\nif hours and not years had passed since then.  They bring to the mind's\neye many dear ones who have passed away, and remind us that we too must\nfollow them.\n\nIt is much to be regretted that this valuable art of graphic memoranda\nis not more generally practised.  It is not merely a most valuable help\nto the memory, but it educates the eye and the hand, and enables us to\ncultivate the faculty of definite observation.  This is one of the most\nvaluable accomplishments that I know of, being the means of storing up\nideas, and not mere words, in the mental recollection of both men and\nwomen.\n\nBefore I proceed to record the recollections of my own life, I wish to\nsay something about my eldest brother Patrick, the well-known landscape\npainter.  He was twenty-one years older than myself!  My father was his\nbest and almost his only instructor.  At a very early age he manifested\na decided taste for drawing and painting.  His bent was landscape.\nThis gave my father great pleasure, as it was his own favourite branch\nof art.  The boy acquired great skill in sketching trees, clouds,\nplants, and foregrounds.  He studied with wonderful assiduity and\nsuccess.  I possess many of his graphic memoranda, which show the care\nand industry with which he educated his eye and hand in rendering with\ntruth and fidelity the intimate details of his art.  The wild plants\nwhich he introduced into the foregrounds of his pictures were his\nfavourite objects of study.  But of all portions of landscape nature,\nthe Sky was the one that most delighted him.  He studied the form and\ncharacter of clouds--resting cloud, the driving cloud, and the rain\ncloud--and the sky portions of his paintings were thus rendered so\nbeautifully attractive.\n\nHe was so earnest in his devotion to the study of landscape that in\nsome respects he neglected the ordinary routine of school education.\nHe successfully accomplished the three R.'s, but after that his school\nwas the fields, in the face of Nature.  He was by no means a Romantic\npainter.  His taste was essentially for Home subjects.  In his\nlandscapes he introduced picturesque farm-houses and cottages,\nwith their rural surroundings; and his advancement and success were\ncommensurate with his devotion to this fine branch of art.  The perfect\ntruth with which he represented English scenery, associated as it is\nwith so many home-loving feelings, forms the special attractiveness of\nhis works.  This has caused them to be eagerly sought after,\nand purchased at high prices.\n\nPatrick had a keen sense of humour, though in other respects he was\nsimple and unpretending.  He was a great reader of old-fashioned\nnovels, which indeed in those days were the only works of the kind to\nbe met with.  The Arabian Nights, Robinson crusoe, The Mysteries of\nUdolpho, and such like, were his favourites, and gave a healthy filip\nto his imagination.  He had also a keen relish for music, and used to\nwhistle melodies and overtures as he went along with his work.\nHe acquired a fair skill in violin playing.  While tired with sitting\nor standing he would take up his violin, play a few passages, and then\ngo to work again.\n\nPatrick removed to London in 1808, and exhibited at the Royal Academy\nin the following year.  He made excursions to various parts of England,\nwhere he found subjects congenial to his ideas of rural beauty.\nThe immediate neighbourhood of London, however, a bounded with the most\ncharming and appropriate subjects for his pencil.  These consisted of\nrural \"bits\" of the most picturesque but homely description--decayed\npollard trees and old moss-grown orchards, combined with cottages and\nfarm-houses in the most paintable state of decay, with tangled hedges\nand neglected fences, overrun with vegetation clinging to them with all\n\"the careless grace of Nature.\"  However neglected these might be by the\nfarmer, they were always tit-bits for Patrick.  When sketching such\nsubjects he was in his glory, and he returned to his easel loaded with\nsketch-book treasures, which when painted form the gems of many a\ncollection.\n\nIn some of these charming subjects glimpses of the distant capital may\nbe observed, with the dome of St. Paul's in the distance; but they are\nintroduced with such skill and correctness as in no way to interfere\nwith the rural character of his subject.  When he went farther afield\n--to Windsor Forest, Hampshire, the New Forest, or the Isle of Wight\n--he was equally diligent with his pencil, and came home laden with\nsketches of the old monarchs of the forest.  When in a state of partial\ndecay his skilful touch brought them to life again, laden with branches\nand lichen, with leaves and twigs and bark, and with every feature that\ngives such a charm to these important elements in true English\nlandscape scenery.  On my brother's first visit to London, accompanied\nby my father, he visited many collections where the old Dutch masters\nwere to be seen, and he doubtless derived much advantage from his\ncareful studies, more particularly from the works of Hobbema, Ruysdael,\nand Wynants.  These came home to him as representations of Nature as\nshe is.  They were more free from the traditional modes of representing\nher.  The works of Claude Lorraine and Richard Wilson were also the\nobjects of his admiration, though the influence of the time for\nclassicality of treatment to a certain extent vitiated these noble\nworks.  When a glorious sunset was observed, the usual expression among\nthe lovers of art was, \"What a magnificent Claudish effect!\"  thus\nsetting up the result of man's feeble attempt at representation as the\nstandard of comparison, in place of the far grander original!\n\nMy brother carefully studied Nature herself.  His works, following\nthose of my father, led back the public taste to a more healthy and\ntrue condition, and by the aid of a noble army of modern British\nlandscape painters, this department of art has been elevated to a very\nhigh standard of truth and excellence.\n\nI find some letters from Patrick to my father, after his settlement as\nan artist in London.  My father seems to have supplied him with money\nduring the early part of his career, and afterwards until he had\nreceived the amount of his commissions for pictures.  In one of his\nletters he says: \"That was an unlucky business, the loss of that order\nwhich you were so good as send me on my account.\"  It turned out that\nthe order had dropt out of the letter enclosing it, and was not\nrecovered.  In fact, Patrick was very careless about all money\ntransactions.\n\nIn 1814 he made the acquaintance of Mr. Barnes, and accompanied him to\nBure Cottage, Ringwood, near Southampton, where he remained for some\ntime.  He went into the New Forest, and brought home \"lots of sketches.\"\nIn 1815 he exhibited his works at the Royal Academy. He writes to his\nfather that \"the prices of my pictures in the Gallery are--\ntwo at fourteen guineas each (small views in Hampshire), one at\ntwelve guineas, and two at fourteen guineas.  They are all sold but\none.  These pictures would now fetch in the open market from two to\nthree hundred guineas each.  But in those days good work was little\nknown, and landscapes especially were very little sought after.\n\nPatrick Nasmyth's admirable rendering of the finer portions of\nlandscape nature attracted the attention of collectors, and he received\nmany commissions from them at very low prices.  There was at that time\na wretched system of delaying the payment for pictures painted on\ncommission, as well as considerable loss of time by the constant\napplications made for the settlement of the balance.  My brother was\naccordingly under the necessity of painting his pictures for the\nDealers, who gave him at once the price which he required for his\nworks.  The influence of this system was not always satisfactory.\nThe Middlemen or Dealers, who stood between the artist and the final\npossessor of the works, were not generous.  They higgled about prices,\nand the sums which they gave were almost infinitesimal compared with\nthe value of Patrick Nasmyth's pictures at the present time.\n\nThe Dealers were frequent visitors at his little painting-room in his\nlodgings.  They took undue advantage of my brother's simplicity and\ninnate modesty in regard to the commercial value of his works.  When he\nhad sketched in a beautiful subject, and when it was clear that in its\nhighest state of development it must prove a fine work, the Dealer\nwould pile up before him a row of guineas, or sovereigns, and say,\n\"Now, Peter, that picture's to be mine!\", The real presence of cash\nproved too much for him.  He never was a practical man.  He agreed to\nthe proposal, and thus he parted with his pictures for much less than\nthey were worth.  He was often remonstrated with by his brother artists\nfor letting them slip out of his hands in that way--works that he\nwould not surrender until he had completed them, and brought them up to\nthe highest point of his fastidious taste and standard of excellence.\nAmong his dearest friends were David Roberts and Clarkson Stanfield.\nHe usually replied to their friendly remonstrances by laughingly\npointing to his bursting portfolios of sketches, and saying,\n\"There's lots of money in these banks to draw from.\"  He thus warded off\ntheir earnest and often-repeated remonstrances.  Being a single man,\nand his habits and style of living of the most simple kind, he had very\nlittle regard for money except as it ministered to his immediate\nnecessities.  His evenings were generally spent at a club of brother\nartists \"over the water;\" and in their company he enjoyed many a\npleasant hour.  His days were spent at his easel.  They were\noccasionally varied by long walks into the country near London,\nfor the purpose of refilling his sketch-book.\n\nIt was on one of such occasions--when he was sketching the details of\nsome picturesque pollard old willows up the Thames, and standing all\nthe time in wet ground--that he caught a severe cold which confined\nhim to the house.  He rapidly became worse.  Two of his sisters,\nwho happened to be in London at the time, nursed him with devoted\nattention.  But it was too late.  The disease had taken fatal hold of\nhim.  On the evening of the l7th August 1831 there was a violent\nthunderstorm.  At length the peals of thunder ceased, the rain passed\naway, and the clouds dispersed.  The setting sun burst forth in a\ngolden glow.  The patient turned round on his couch and asked that the\ncurtains might be drawn.  It was done.  A blaze of sunset lit up his\nweary and worn-out face.  \"How glorious it is!\" he said.  Then, as the\nglow vanished he fell into a deep and tranquil sleep, from which he\nnever awoke.  Such was the peaceful end of my brother Patrick, at the\ncomparatively early age of forty-four years.\n\n\nCHAPTER 4.  My Early Years.\n\nI WAS born on the morning of the 19th of August 1808, at my father's\nhouse No. 47 York Place, Edinburgh.  I was named James Hall after my\nfather's dear friend, Sir James Hall of Dunglass.  My mother afterwards\ntold me that I must have been \"a very noticin'  bairn,\" as she observed\nme, when I was only a few days old, following with my little eyes any\none who happened to be in the room, as if I had been thinking to my\nlittle self, \"Who are you?\"\n\nAfter a suitable time I was put under the care of a nursemaid.\nI remember her well--Mary Peterkin--a truly Scandinavian name.\nShe came from Haddingtonshire, where most of the people are of\nScandinavian origin.  Her hair was of a bright yellow tint.\nShe was a cheerful young woman, and sang to me like a nightingale.\nShe could not only sing old Scotch songs, but had a wonderful memory\nfor fairy tales. When under the influence of a merry laugh,\nyou could scarcely see her eyes; their twinkle was hidden by her\neyelids and lashes.  She was a willing worker, and was always ready\nto lend a helping hand at everything about the house, she took great\npride in me, calling me her \"laddie.\"\n\nWhen I was toddling about the house, another sister was born, the last\nof the family.  Little Mary was very delicate; and to improve her\nhealth she was sent to a small farm-house at Braid Hills, about four\nmiles south of Edinburgh.  It was one of the most rural and beautiful\nsurroundings of the city at that time.  One of my earliest\nrecollections is that of being taken to see poor little Mary at the\nfarmer's house.  While my nursemaid was occupied in inquiring after my\nsister, I was attracted by the bright red poppies in a neighbouring\nfield.  When they made search for me I could not be found.  I was lost\nfor more than an hour.  At last, seeing a slight local disturbance\namong the stalks of corn, they rushed to they spot, and brought me out\nwith an armful of brilliant red poppies.  To this day poppies continue\nto be my greatest favourites.\n\nWhen I was about four or five years old, I was observed to give a\ndecided preference to the use of my left hand.  Everything was done to\nprevent my using it in preference to the right.  My mother thought that\nit arose from my being carried on the wrong arm by my nurse while an\ninfant.  The right hand was thus confined, and the left hand was used.\nI was constantly corrected, but \"on the sly\" I always used it,\nespecially in drawing my first little sketches.  At last my father,\nafter viewing with pleasure one of my artistic efforts, done with the\nforbidden hand, granted it liberty and independence for all time\ncoming.  \"Well,\" he said, \"you may go on in your own way in the use of\nyour left hand, but I fear you will be an awkward fellow in everything\nthat requires handiness in life.  I used my right hand in all that was\nnecessary, and my left in all sorts of practical manipulative affairs.\nMy left hand has accordingly been my most willing and obedient servant\nin transmitting my will through my fingers into material or visible\nforms.  In this way I became ambidexter.\n\nWhen I was about four years old, I often followed my father into his\nworkshop when he had occasion to show to his visitors some of his\nmechanical contrivances or artistic models.  The persons present\nusually expressed their admiration in warm terms of what was shown to\nthem.  On one occasion I gently pulled the coat-tail of one of the\nlisteners and confidentially said to him, as if I knew all about it,\n\"My papa's a kevie Fellae!\"  My father was so greatly amused by this\nremark that he often referred to it as \"the last good thing\" from that\nold-fashioned creature little Jamie.\n\nOne of my earliest recollections is the annual celebration of my\nbrother Patrick's birthday.  Being the eldest of the family, his\nbirthday was held in special honour.  My father invited about twenty of\nhis most intimate friends to dinner.  My mother brought her culinary\npowers into full operation.  The younger members of the family also\ntook a lively interest in all that was going on, with certain\nreversionary views as to \"the day after the feast.\"  We took a great\ninterest in the Trifle, which was no trifle in reality, in so far as\nregarded the care and anxiety involved in its preparation.\nIn connection with this celebration, it was all established institution\nthat a large hamper always arrived in good time from the farm attached\nto my mother's old home at Woodhall, near Edinburgh.  It contained many\nsubstantial elements for the entertainment--a fine turkey, fowls,\nduck, and suchlike; with two magnums of the richest cream.  There never\nwas such cream!  It established a standard of cream in my memory;\nand since then I have always been hypercritical about the article.\n\nOn one of these occasions, when I was about four years old, and being\nthe youngest of the family, I was taken into the company after the\ndinner was over, and held up by my sister Jane to sing a verse from a\nlittle song which my nurse Mary Peterkin had taught me, and Which ran\nthus:\n\n \"I'll no bide till Saturday,\n But I'll awa' tile morn,\n An' follow Donald Hielandman,\n An' carry his poother-horn.\"\n\nThis was my first and last vocal performance.  It was received with\ngreat applause.  In fact, it was encored.  The word \"poother,\"\nwhich I pronounced \"pootle\", excited the enthusiasm of the audience.\nI was then sent to bed with a bit of plum-cake, and was doubtless\nawakened early next morning by the irritation of the dried crumbs of\nthe previous night's feast.\n\nI am reminded, by reading over a letter of my brother Patrick's, of an\nawkward circumstance that happened to me when I was six years old.\nIn his letter to my father, dated London, 22d September 1814, he says:\n\"I did get a surprise when Margaret's letter informed me of my little\nbrother Jamie's fall.  It was a wonderful escape.  For God's sake keep\nan eye upon him!\"  Like other strong and healthy boys, I had a turn for\namusing myself in my own way.  When sliding down the railing of the\nstairs I lost my grip and fell suddenly over.  The steps were of stone.\nFortunately, the servants were just coming up laden with carpets which\nthey had been beating.  I fell into their midst and knocked them out of\ntheir hands.  I was thus saved from cracking my poor little skull.\nBut for that there might have been no steam hammer--at least of my\ncontrivance!\n\nEverything connected with war and warlike exploits is interesting to a\nboy.  The war with France was then in full progress.  Troops and bands\nparaded the streets.  Recruits were sent away as fast as they could be\ndrilled.  The whole air was filled with war.  Everybody was full of\nexcitement about the progress of events in Spain.  When the great guns\nboomed forth from the Castle, the people were first startled.\nThen they were surprised and anxious.  There had been a battle and a\nvictory!  \"Who had fallen?\" was the first thought in many minds.\nWhere had the battle been, and what was the victory?  Business was\nsuspended.  People rushed about the streets to ascertain the facts.\nIt might have been at Salamanca, Talavera, or Vittoria.  But a long\ntime elapsed before the details could be received; and during that time\nsad suspense and anxiety prevailed in almost every household.\nThere was no telegraph then.  It was only after the Gazette had been\npublished that people knew who had fallen and who had survived.\n\nThe war proceeded.  The volunteering which went on at the time gave\nquite a military aspect to the city.  I remember how odd it appeared to\nme to see some well-known faces and figures metamorphosed into soldiers\nIt was considered a test of loyalty as well as of patriotism, to give\ntime, money, and leisure to take up the arms of defence, and to\npractise daily in military uniform in the Meadows or on Bruntsfield\nLinks.  Windows were thrown up to hear the bands playing at the head of\nthe troops, and crowds of boys, full of military ardour, went, as usual,\nhand to hand in front of the drums and fifes.  The most interesting\npart of the procession to my mind was the pioneers in front, with their\nleather aprons, their axes and saws, and their big hairy caps and\nbeards.  They were to me so suggestive of clearing the way through\nhedges and forests, and of what war was in its actual progress.\n\nEvery victory was followed by the importation of large numbers of\nFrench prisoners.  Many of them were sent to Edinburgh Castle.\nThey were permitted to relieve the tedium of their confinement by\nmanufacturing and selling toys; workboxes, brooches, and carved work of\ndifferent kinds.  In the construction of these they exhibited great\nskill, taste, and judgment.  They carved them out of bits of bone and\nwood.  The patterns were most beautiful; and they were ingeniously and\ntastefully ornamented.  The articles were to be had for a mere trifle,\nalthough fit to be placed with the most choice objects of artistic\nskill.\n\nThese poor prisoners of war were allowed to work at their tasteful\nhandicrafts in small sheds or temporary workshops at the Castle, behind\nthe palisades which separated them from their free customers outside.\nThere was just room between the bars of the palisades for them to hand\nthrough their exquisite works, and to receive in return the modest\nprices which they charged.  The front of these palisades became a\nfavourite resort for the inhabitants of Edinburgh; and especially for\nthe young folks.  I well remember being impressed with the contrast\nbetween the almost savage aspect of these dark-haired foreigners,\nand the neat and delicate produce of their skilful fingers.\n\nAt the peace of 1814, which followed the siege of Paris, great\nrejoicings and illuminations took place, in the belief that the war was\nat an end.  The French prisoners were sent back to their own country,\nalas! to appear again before us at Waterloo.  The liberation of those\nconfined in Edinburgh Castle was accompanied by an extraordinary scene.\nThe French prisoners marched down to the transport ships at Leith by\ntorchlight.  All the town was out to see them.  They passed in military\nprocession through the principal streets, singing as they marched along\ntheir revolutionary airs, \"Ca lra\" and \"The Marseillaise.\"  The wild\nenthusiasm of these haggard-looking men, lit up by torchlight and\naccompanied by the cheers of the dense crowd which lined the streets\nand filled the windows, made an impression on my mind that I can never\nforget.\n\nA year passed.  Napoleon returned from Elba, and was rejoined by nearly\nall his old fighting-men.  I well remember, young as I was, an assembly\nof the inhabitants of Edinburgh in Charlotte Square, to bid farewell to\nthe troops and officers then in garrison.  It was a fine summer\nevening when this sad meeting took place.  The bands were playing as\ntheir last performance, \"Go where glory waits thee!\"  The air brought\ntears to many eyes; for many who were in the ranks might never return.\nAfter many a hand-shaking, the troops marched to the Castle, previous\nto their early embarkation for the Low Countries on the following\nmorning.\n\nThen came Waterloo and the victory!  The Castle guns boomed forth again;\nand the streets were filled with people anxious to hear the news.\nAt last came the Gazette filled with the details of the killed and\nwounded.  Many a heart was broken, many a fireside was made desolate.\nIt was indeed a sad time.  The terrible anxiety that pervaded so many\nfamilies; the dreadful sacrifice of lives on so many battlefields; and\nthe enormously increased taxation, which caused so many families to\nstint themselves to even the barest necessaries of life;--such was\nthe inglorious side of war.\n\nBut there was also the glory, which almost compensated for the sorrow.\nI cannot resist narrating the entry of the Forty-second Regiment into\nEdinburgh shortly after the battle of Waterloo.  The old \"Black Watch\"\nis a regiment dear to every Scottish heart.  It has fought and\nstruggled when resistance was almost certain death.  At Quatre Bras two\nflank companies were cut to pieces by Pire's cavalry.  The rest of the\nregiment was assailed by Reille's furious cannonade, and suffered\nseverely.  The French were beaten back, and the remnant of the\nForty-second retired to Waterloo, where they formed part of the brigade\nunder Major-General Pack.  At the first grand charge of the French,\nPicton fell and many were killed.  Then the charge of the Greys took\nplace, and the Highland regiments rushed forward, with cries of\n\"Scotland for ever!\"  Only a remnant of the Forty-second survived.\nThey were however recruited, and marched into France with the rest of\nthe army.\n\nTowards the end of the year the Forty-Second returned to England,\nand in the beginning of 1816 they set out on their march towards\nEdinburgh.  They were everywhere welcomed with enthusiasm.  Crowds\nturned out to meet them and cheer them.  When the first division of the\nregiment approached Edinburgh, almost the entire population turned out\nto welcome them.  At Musselburgh, six miles off; the road was thronged\nwith people.  When the soldiers reached Piershill, two miles off, the\nroad was so crowded that it took them two hours to reach the Castle.\nI was on a balcony in the upper part of the High Street, and my father,\nmother, and sisters were with me.  We had waited very long; but at last\nwe heard the distant sound of the cheers, which came on and on, louder\nand louder.\n\nThe High Street was wedged with people excited and anxious.\nThere seemed scarcely room for a regiment to march through them.\nThe house-tops and windows were crowded with spectators.  It was a\ngrand sight.  The high-gabled houses reaching as far as the eye could\nsee, St. Giles' with its mural crown, the Tron Kirk in the distance,\nand the picturesque details of the buildings, all added to the\neffectiveness of the scene.\n\nAt last the head of the gallant band appeared.  The red coats gradually\nwedged their way through the crowd, amidst the ringing of bells and the\ncheers of the spectators.  Every window was in a wave of gladness,\nand every house-top was in a fever of excitement.  As the red line\npassed our balcony, with Colonel Dick at its head, we saw a sight that\ncan never be forgotten.  The red-and-white plumes, the tattered colours\nriddled with bullets, the glittering bayonets, were seen amidst the\ncrowd that thronged round the gallant heroes, amidst tears and cheers\nand hand-shakings and shouts of excitement.  The mass of men appeared\nlike a solid body moving slowly along; the soldiers being almost hidden\namongst the crowd.  At last they passed, the pipers and drums playing a\nHighland march; and the Forty-Second slowly entered the Castle.  It was\nperhaps the most extraordinary scene ever witnessed in Edinburgh.\n\nOne of my greatest enjoyments when a child was in going out with the\nservants to the Calton, and wait while the \"claes\" bleached in the sun\non the grassy slopes of the hill.  The air was bright and fresh and\npure.  The lasses regarded these occasions as a sort of holiday.\nOne or two of the children usually accompanied them.  They sat\ntogether, and the servants told us their auld-warld stories; common\nenough in those days, but which have now, in a measure, been forgotten.\n\"Steam\" and \"progress\" have made the world much less youthful and\njoyous than it was then.\n\nThe women brought their work and their needles with them, and when they\nhad told their stories, the children ran about the hill making bunches\nof wild flowers--including harebells and wild thyme.  They ran after\nthe butterflies and the bumbees, and made acquaintance in a small way\nwith the beauties of nature.  Then the servants opened their baskets of\nprovisions, and we had a delightful picnic.  Though I am now writing\nabout seventy years after the date of these events, I can almost\nbelieve that I am enjoying the delightful perfume of the wild thyme and\nthe fragrant plants and flowers, wafted around me by the warm breezes\nof the Calton hillside.\n\nIn the days I refer to, there was always a most cheerful and intimate\nintercourse kept up between the children and the servants.  They were\nmembers of the same family, and were treated as such.  The servants\nwere for the most part country-bred--daughters of farm servants or\nsmall farmers.  They were fairly educated at their parish schools;\nthey could read and write, and had an abundant store of old\nrecollections.  Many a pleasant crack we had with them as to their\nnative places, their families, and all that was connected with them.\nThey became lastingly attached to their masters and mistresses, as well\nas to the children.  All this led to true attachment; and when they\nleft; us, for the most part to be married we continued to keep up a\ncorrespondence with them, which lasted for many years.\n\nWhile enjoying these delightful holidays, before my school-days began,\nmy practical education was in progress, especially in the way of\nacquaintance with the habits of nature in a vast variety of its phases,\nalways so attractive to the minds of healthy children.  It happened\nthat close to the Calton Hill, in the valley at its northern side,\nthere were many workshops where interesting trades were carried on;\nthere were coppersmiths, tinsmiths, brass-founders, goldbeaters, and\nblacksmiths.  Their shops were all arranged in a busy group at the foot\nof the hill, in a place called Greenside.  The workshops were open to\nthe inspection of passers-by.  Little boys looked in and saw the men at\nwork amidst the blaze of fires and the beatings of hammers.\n\nAmongst others, I was an ardent admirer.  I may almost say that this\nrow of busy workshops was my first school of practical education.\nI observed the mechanical manipulation of the men, their dexterous use\nof the hammer, the chisel, and the file; and I imbibed many lessons\nwhich afterwards proved of use to me.  Then I had tools at home in my\nfather's workshop.  I tried to follow their methods; I became greatly\ninterested in the use of tools and their appliances; I could make\nthings for myself.  In short, I became so skilled that the people about\nthe house called me \"a little Jack-of-all-trades.\"\n\nWhile sitting on the grassy slopes of the Calton Hill I would often\nhear the chimes sounding from the grand old tower of St.Giles.\nThe cathedral lay on the other side of the valley which divides the\nOld Town from the New.  The sounds came over the murmur of the traffic\nin the streets below.\n\nThe chime-bells were played every day from twelve till one--the\nold-fashioned dinner-hour of the citizens.  The practice had been in\nexistence for more than a hundred and fifty years.  The pleasing effect\nof the merry airs, which came wafted tome by the warm summer breezes,\nmade me long to see them as well as hear them.\n\n[Image]  Mural crown of St Giles', Edinburgh\n\nMy father was always anxious to give pleasure to his children.\nAccordingly, he took me one day, as a special treat, to the top of the\ngrand old tower, to see the chimes played.  As we passed up the tower,\na strong vaulted room was pointed out to me, where the witches used to\nbe imprisoned.  I was told that the poor old women were often taken\ndown from this dark vault to be burnt alive!  Such terrible tales\nenveloped the tower with a horrible fascination to my young mind.\nWhat a fearful contrast to the merry sound of the chimes issuing from\nits roof on a bright summer day.\n\nOn my way up to the top flat, where the chimes were played, I had to\npass through the vault in which the great pendulum was slowly swinging\nin its ghostly-like tick-tack, tick-tack; while the great ancient clock\nwas keeping time with its sudden and startling movement.  The whole\nscene was almost as uncanny as the witches' cell underneath.  There was\nalso a wild rumbling thumping sound overhead.  I soon discovered the\ncause of this, when I entered the flat where the musician was at work.\nHe was seen in violent action, beating or hammering on the keys of a\ngigantic pianoforte-like apparatus.  The instruments he used were two\ngreat leather-faced mallets, one of which he held in each hand.\nEach key was connected by iron rods with the chime-bells above.\nThe frantic and mad-like movements of the musician, as he energetically\nrushed from one key to another, often widely apart gave me the idea\nthat the man was daft--especially as the noise of the mallets was\nsuch that I heard no music emitted from the chimes so far overhead.\nIt was only when I had climbed up the stair of the tower to where the\nbells were rung that I understood the performance, and comprehended the\nbeating of the chimes which gave me so much pleasure when I heard them\nat a distance.\n\nAnother source of enjoyment in my early days was to accompany my mother\nto the market.  As I have said before, my mother, though generous in\nher hospitality, was necessarily thrifty and economical in the\nmanagement of her household.  There were no less than fourteen persons\nin the house to be fed, and this required a good deal of marketing.\nAt the time I refer to, (about 1816, it was the practice of every lady\nwho took pride in managing economically the home department of her\nhusband's affairs, to go to market in person.  The principal markets in\nEdinburgh were then situated in the valley between the Old and New Towns,\nin what used to be called the Nor Loch.\n\nDealers in fish and vegetables had their stalls there: the market for\nbutcher meat was near at hand: each being in their several locations.\nIt was a very lively and bustling sight to see the marketing going on.\nWhen a lady was observed approaching, likely to be a customer, she was\nat once surrounded by the \"caddies.\"  They were a set of sturdy\nhard-working women, each with a creel on her back.  Their competition\nfor the employer sometimes took a rather energetic form.  The rival\ncandidates pointed to her with violent exclamations; \"She's my ledie!\nshe's my ledie!\" ejaculated one and all.  To dispel the disorder,\na selection of one of the caddies would be made, and then all was quiet\nagain until another customer appeared.\n\nThere was a regular order in which the purchases were deposited in the\ncreel.  First, there came the fish, which were carefully deposited in\nthe lowest part, with a clean deal board over them.  The fishwives were\na most sturdy and independent class, both in manners and language.\nWhen at home, at Newhaven or Fisherrow, they made and mended their\nhusbands' nets, put their fishing tackle to rights, and when the\nfishing boats came in they took the fish to market at Edinburgh.\nTo see the groups of these hard-working women trudging along with their\nheavy creels on their backs, clothed in their remarkable costume,\nwith their striped petticoats kilted up and showing their sturdy legs,\nwas indeed a remarkable sight.  They were cheerful and good-natured,\nbut very outspoken.  Their skins were clear and ruddy, and many of the\nyoung fishwives were handsome and pretty.  They were, in fact, the\nincarnation of robust health.  In dealing with them at the Fish Market\nthere was a good deal of higgling.  They often asked two or three times\nmore than the fish were worth--at least, according to the then market\nprice.  After a stormy night, during which the husbands and sons had\ntoiled to catch the fish, on the usual question being asked,\n\"Weel, Janet, hoo's haddies the day!\" \"Haddies, mem?  Ou, haddies is\nmen's lives the day!\"  which was often true, as haddocks were often\ncaught at the risk of their husbands' lives.  After the usual amount of\nhiggling, the haddies were brought down to their proper market price,\n--sometimes a penny for a good haddock, or, when herrings were rife,\na dozen herrings for twopence, crabs for a penny, and lobsters for\nthreepence.  For there were no railways then to convey the fish to\nEngland, and thus equalise the price for all classes of the community.\n\nLet me mention here a controversy between a fishwife and a buyer called\nThomson.  the buyer offered a price so ridiculously small for a parcel\nof fish that the seller became quite indignant, and she terminated at\nonce all further higgling.  Looking up to him, she said, \"Lord help yer\ne'e-sight, Maister Tamson!\" \"Lord help my e'e-sight, woman!  What has\nthat to do with it?\" \"Ou,\" said she, \"because ye ha'e nae nose to put\nspectacles on!\"  As it happened, poor Mr. Thomson had, by some accident\nor disease, so little of a nose left, if any at all, that the bridge of\nthe nose for holding up the spectacles was almost entirely wanting.\nAnd thus did the fishwife retaliate on her niggardly customer.\n\nWhen my mother had got her fish laid at the bottom of the creel, she\nnext went to the \"flesher\" for her butcher-meat.  There was no higgling\nhere, for the meat was sold at the ordinary market price. Then came the\npoultry stratum; then the vegetables, or fruits in their season;\nand, finally, there was \"the floore\"--a bunch of flowers;\nnot a costly bouquet, but a, large assortment of wallflowers, daffodils\n(with their early spring fragrance), polyanthuses, lilacs, gilly-flowers,\nand the glorious old-fashioned cabbage rose, as well as the even more\ngloriously fragrant moss rose. The caddy's creel was then topped up,\nand the marketing was completed.  The lady was followed home; the\ncontents were placed in the larder; and the flowers distributed all\nover the house.\n\nI have many curious traditional evidences of the great fondness for\ncats which distinguished the Nasmyth family for several generations.\nMy father had always one or two of such domestic favourites, who were,\nin the best sense, his \"familiars.\"  Their quiet, companionable habits\nrendered them very acceptable company when engaged in his artistic\nwork.  I know of no sound so pleasantly tranquillising as the purring\nof a cat, or of anything more worthy of admiration in animal habit as\nthe neat, compact, and elegant manner in which the cat adjusts itself\nat the fireside, or in a snug, cosy place, when it settles down for a\nlong quiet sleep.  Every spare moment that a cat has before lying down\nto rest is occupied in carefully cleaning itself, even under adverse\ncircumstances.  The cat is the true original inventor of a sanitary\nprocess, which has lately been patented and paraded before the public\nas a sanitary novelty; and yet it has been in practice ever since cats\nwere created.  Would that men and women were more alive to habitual\ncleanliness--even the cleanliness of cats.  The kindly and gentle\nanimal gives us all a lesson in these respects.\n\nThen, nothing can be more beautiful in animal action than the\nexquisitely precise and graceful manner in which the cat exerts the\nexact amount of effort requisite to land it at the height and spot it\nwishes to reach at one bound.  The neat and delicately precise manner\nin which cats use their paws when playing with those who habitually\ntreat them with gentle kindness is truly admirable.  In these respects\ncats are entitled to the most kindly regard.  There are, unfortunately,\nmany who entertain a strong prejudice against this most perfect and\nbeautiful member of the animal creation, and who abuse them because\nthey resist ill-treatment, occasioned by their innate feeling of\nindependence.  Cats have no doubt less personal attachment than dogs,\nbut when kindly treated they become in many respects attached and\naffectionate animals.\n\nMy father, when a boy, made occasional visits to Hamilton, in the West\nof Scotland, where the descendants of his Covenanting ancestors still\nlived.  One of them was an old bachelor--a recluse sort of man;\nand yet he had the Nasmyth love of cats.  Being of pious pedigree and\nhabits, he always ended the day by a long and audible prayer.\nMy father and his companions used to go to the door of his house to\nlisten to him, but especially to hear his culminating finale.\nHe prayed that the Lord would help him to forgive his enemies and all\nthose who had done him injury; and then, with a loud burst, he\nconcluded, \"Except John Anderson o' the Toonhead, for he killed my cat,\nand him I'll ne'er forgie!  In conclusion, I may again refer to Elspeth\nNasmyth, who was burnt alive for witchcraft, because she had four black\ncats, and read her Bible through two Pairs of spectacles!\n\n\nCHAPTER 5.  My School-days.\n\nBefore I went to school it was my good fortune to be placed under the\nspecial care of my eldest sister, Jane.  She was twenty years older\nthan myself, and had acquired much practical experience in the\nmanagement of the younger members of the family.  I could not have\nhad a more careful teacher.  She initiated me into the difficulties of\nA B C, and by learning me to read she gave me a key to the thoughts of\nthe greatest thinkers who have ever lived.\n\nBut all this was accomplished at first in a humdrum and tentative way.\nAbout seventy years ago children's books were very uninteresting.\nIn the little stories manufactured for children, the good boy ended in\na Coach-and-four, and the bad boy in a ride to Tyburn.  The good boys\nmust have been a set of little snobs and prigs, and I could scarcely\nimagine that they could ever have lived as they were represented in\nthese goody books.  If so, they must have been the most tiresome and\nuninteresting vermin that can possibly be imagined. After my sister had\ndone what she could for me, I was sent to school to learn \"English.\"\nI was placed under the tuition of a leading teacher called Knight,\nwhose school-room was in the upper storey of a house in George Street.\nHere I learned to read with ease.  But my primitive habit of spelling\nby ear, in accordance with the simple sound of the letters of the\nalphabet (phonetically, so to speak) brought me into collision with my\nteacher.  I got many a cuff on the side of the head, and many a\n\"palmy\" on my hands with a thick strap of hard leather, which did not\ngive me very inviting views as to the pleasures of learning.\nThe master was vicious and vindictive.  I think it a cowardly way to\ndeal with a little boy in so cruel a manner, and to send him home with\nhis back and fingers tingling and sometimes bleeding, because he cannot\nlearn so quickly as his fellows.\n\nOn one occasion Knight got out of temper with my stupidity or dulness\nin not comprehending something about 'a preter-pluperfect tense,' or\nsome mystery of that sort.  He seized me by the ears, and beat my head\nagainst the wall behind me with such savage violence that when he let\nme go, stunned and unable to stand, I fell forward on the floor\nbleeding violently at the nose, and with a terrific headache.\nThe wretch might have ruined my brain for life.  I was carried home and\nput to bed, where I lay helpless for more than a week.  My father\nthreatened to summon the teacher before the magistrates for what might\nhave been a fatal assault on poor little me; but on making a humble\napology for his brutal usage he was let off.  Of course I was not sent\nback to his school.  I have ever since entertained a hatred against\ngrammatical rules.\n\nThere was at that time an excellent system of teaching young folks the\nvalue of thrift.  This consisted in saving for some purpose or another\nthe Saturdays penny--one penny being our weekly allowance of\npocket-money.  The feats we could perform in the way of procuring toys,\npicture-books, or the materials for constructing flying kites, would\namaze the youngsters of the present day, who are generally spoiled by\nextravagance.  And yet we obtained far more pleasure from our\npurchases.  We had in my time \"penny pigs,\" or thrift boxes.\nThey were made in a vase form, of brown glazed earthenware, the only\nentrance to which was a slit--enough to give entrance to a penny.\nWhen the Saturday's penny was not required for any immediate purposes,\nit was dropped through the slit, and remained there until the box was\nfull.  The maximum of pennies it could contain was about forty-eight.\nWhen that was accomplished, the penny pig was broken with a hammer,\nand its rich contents flowed forth.  The breaking of the pig was quite\nan event.  The fine fat old George the Third penny pieces looked\nthoroughly substantial in our eyes.  And then there was the spending of\nthe money,--for some long-looked-for toy, or pencils, or book,\nor painting materials.\n\nOne of the ways in which I used my Saturday pennies was in going with\nsome of my companions into the country to have a picnic.  We used to\nlight a fire behind a hedge or a dyke, or in the corner of some ruin,\nand there roast our potatoes, or broil a red herring on an extempore\ngridiron we contrived for the purpose.  We lit the fire by means of a\nflint and steel and a tinder-box, which in those days every boy used to\npossess.  The bramble-berries gave us our dessert.  We thoroughly\nenjoyed these glorious Saturday afternoons.  It gave us quite a\nRobinson Crusoe sort of feeling to be thus secluded from the world.\nThen the beauty of the scenery amidst which we took our repast was such\nas I cannot attempt to describe.  A walk of an hour or so would bring\nus into the presence of an old castle, or amongst the rocky furze and\nheather-clad hills, amidst clear rapid streams, so that, but for the\ndistant peeps of the city, one might think that he was far from the\nbusy haunts of men and boys.\n\nTo return to my school-days.  Shortly after I left the school in\nGeorge Street, where the schoolmaster had almost split my skull in\nbattering it upon the wall behind me, I was entered as a pupil at the\nEdinburgh High School, in October 1817.  The school was situated near\nthe old Infirmary.  Professor Pillans was the rector, and under him\nwere four masters.  I was set to study Latin under Mr. Irvine.  He was\na mere schoolmaster in the narrowest sense of the term.  He was not\nendowed with the best of tempers, and it was often put to the\nbreaking strain by the tricks and negligence of the lower-form\nportion of his class.  It consisted of nearly two hundred boys;\nthe other three masters had about the same number of scholars.\nThey each had a separate class-room.\n\nI began to learn the elementary rudiments of Latin grammar.  But not\nhaving any natural aptitude for aquiring classic learning so called,\nI fear I made but little progress during the three years that I\nremained at the High School.  Had the master explained to us how\nnearly allied many of the Latin and Greek roots were to our familiar\nEnglish words, I feel assured that so interesting and valuable a\ndepartment of instruction would not have been neglected.  But our\nmemories were strained by being made to say off \"by heart,\" as it was\nabsurdly called, whole batches of grammatical rules, with all the\nbotheration of irregular verbs and suchlike.  So far as I was\nconcerned, I derived little benefit from my High School teaching,\nexcept that I derived one lesson which is of great use in after life.\nI mean as regards the performance of duty.  I did my tasks punctually\nand cheerfully, though they were far from agreeable.  This is an\nexercise in early life that is very useful in later years.\n\nIn my walks to and from the High School, the usual way was along the\nNorth and South Bridges,--the first over the Nor' Loch, now the\nrailway station, and the second over the Cowgate.  That was the main\nstreet between the Old Town and the New.  But there were numerous\nwynds and closes (as the narrow streets are called) which led down\nfrom the High Street and the upper part of the Canongate to the High\nSchool, through which I often preferred to wander.  So long as Old\nEdinburgh was confined within its walls the nobles lived in those\nnarrow streets; and the Old houses are full of historical incident.\nMy father often pointed out these houses to me, and I loved to keep\nup my recollections.  I must have had a little of the antiquarian\nspirit even then.  I got to know the most remarkable of those ancient\nhouses--many of which were distinguished by the inscriptions on the\nlintel of the entrance, as well as the arms of the former possessors.\nSome had mottoes such as this: \"BLESIT BE GOD AND HYS GIFTIS. 1584.\"\nThere was often a tower-shaped projection from the main front of the\nhouse, up which a spiral stair proceeded.\n\nThis is usually a feature in old Scotch buildings.  But in these closes\nthe entrance to the houses was through a ponderous door, studded with\ngreat broad-headed nails, with loopholes at each side of the door,\nas if to present the strongest possible resistance to any attempt at\nforcible entrance.  Indeed, in the old times before the Union the\nnobles were often as strong as the King, and many a time the High Street\nwas reddened by the blood of the noblest and bravest of the land.\nIn 1588 there was a cry of \"A Naesmyth,\" \"A Scott,\" in the High Street.\nIt was followed by a clash of arms, and two of Sir Michael Naesmyth's\nsons were killed in that bloody feud.  Edinburgh was often the scene of\nsuch disasters.  Hence the strengthening of their houses, so as to\nresist the inroads of feudal enemies.\n\n[Image]  Doorhead, from an old mansion\n\nThe mason-work of the doors was executed with great care and dexterity.\nIt was chamfered at the edges in a bold manner, and ornamented with an\nO.G. bordering, which had a fine effect while it rendered the entrance\nmore pleasant by the absence of sharp angles.  The same style of\nornamentation was generally found round the edges of the stone-work of\nthe windows, most commonly by chamfering off the square angle of the\nstone-work.  This not only added a grim grace to the appearance of the\nwindows, but allowed a more free entrance of light into the apartments,\nwhile it permitted the inmates to have a better ranged view up and down\nthe Close.  These gloomy-looking mansions were grim in a terrible\nsense, and they reminded one of the fearful transactions of\n\"the good old times!\"\n\nOn many occasions, when I was taking a daunder through these historic\nhouses in the wynds and closes of the Old Town, I have met Sir Walter\nScott showing them to his visitors, and listened to his deep, earnest\nvoice while narrating to them some terrible incident in regard to their\nformer inhabitants.  On other occasions I have frequently met Sir Walter\nsturdily limping along over the North Bridge, while on his way from the\nCourt of Session (where he acted as Clerk of the Records) to his house\nin Castle Street.  In the same way I saw most of the public characters\nconnected with the Law Courts or the University.  Sir Waiter was easily\ndistinguished by his height, as well as his limp or halt in his walk.\nMy father was intimate with most, if not all, of the remarkable\nEdinburgh characters, and when I had the pleasure of accompanying him\nin his afternoon walks I could look at them and hear them in the\nconversations that took place.\n\nI remember, when I was with my father in one of his walks, that a\nyoung English artist accompanied us.  He had come across the Border to\nbe married at Gretna Green, and he brought his bride onward to\nEdinburgh.  My father wished to show him some of the most remarkable\nold buildings of the town.  It was about the end of 1817, when one of\nthe most interesting buildings in Edinburgh was about to be\ndemolished.  This was no less a place than the Old Tolbooth in the\nHigh Street,--a grand but gloomy old building.  It had been\noriginally used as the city palace of the Scottish kings.  There they\nheld their councils and dispensed justice.  But in course of time the\nKing and Court abandoned the place, and it had sunk into a gaol or\nprison for the most abandoned of malefactors.  After their trial the\nprisoners were kept there waiting for execution, and they were hanged\non a flat-roofed portion of the building at its west end.\n\n[Image]  The Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh.  By Alexander Nasmyth.\n         From the drawing in the possession of lord Inglis,\n         Lord Justice-General.\n\nAt one of the strongest parts of the building a strong oak chest,\niron-plated, had been built in, held fast by a thick wall of stone and\nmortar on each side.  The iron chest measured about nine feet square,\nand was closed by a strong iron door with heavy bolts and locks.  This\nwas the Heart of Midlothian, the condemned cell of the Tolbooth.*\n [footnote...\nLong after the condemned cell had been pulled down, an English Chartist\nwent down to Edinburgh to address a large meeting of his brother\npoliticians.  He began by addressing them as \"Men of the Heart of\nMidlothian!\"  There was a loud guffaw throughout the audience.\nHe addressed them as if they were a body of condemned malefactors.\n ...]\n\nThe iron chest was so heavy that the large body of workmen could not,\nwith all their might, pull it out.  After stripping it of its masonry,\nthey endeavoured by strong levers to tumble it down into the street.\nAt last, with a \"Yo! heave ho!\" it fell down with a mighty crash.\n\nThe iron chest was so strong that it held together, and only the narrow\niron door, with its locks, bolts, and bars, was burst open, and jerked\noff amongst the bystanders.\n\nIt was quite a scene.  A large crowd had assembled, and amongst them\nwas Sir Walter Scott.  Recognising my father, he stood by him,\nwhile both awaited the ponderous crash.  Sir Walter was still the Great\nUnknown.  When his Heart of Midlothian was published in the course of\nthe following year, it was pretty well known that he was the author of\nthat fascinating novel.  Sir Waiter got the door and the key, as\nrelics, for his house at Abbotsford.\n\nThere was a rush of people towards the iron chest to look into the dark\ninterior of that veritable chamber of horrors.  My father's artist\nfriend went forward with the rest, and endeavoured to pick up some\nremnant of the demolished structure.  As soon as the clouds of dust had\nbeen dispersed, he observed, under the place where the iron box had\nstood, a number of skeletons of rats, as dry as mummies.  He selected\none of these,*\n [footnote...\nI was so much impressed with the events of the day, and also with the\nfact of the young artist having taken with him so repulsive a memento\nas a rat's skeleton, that I never forgot it.  More than half century\nlater, when I was at a private view of the Royal Academy, I saw sitting\non one of the sofas a remarkable and venerable-looking old gentleman.\nOn inquiring of my friend Thomas Webster who he was, he answered,\n\"Why, that's old Linnell!\"  I then took the liberty of sitting down\nbeside him, and, apologising for my intrusion on his notice, I said it\nwas just fifty-seven years since I had last seen him!  I mentioned the\ncircumstance of the rat-skeleton which he had put in his pocket at\nEdinburgh.  He was pleased and astonished to have the facts so vividly\nrecalled to his mind.  At last he said, \"Well, I have that mummy rat,\nthe relic of the Heart of Midlothian, safe in a cabinet of curiosities\nin my house at Redhill to this day.\"\n ...]\nwrapped it in a newspaper and put it in his pocket as a recollection\nof his first day in Edinburgh, and of the final destruction of the\n\"Heart of Midlothian.\"  This artist was no other than John Linnell,\nthe afterwards famous landscape painter.  He was then a young and\nunknown man.  He brought a letter of introduction to my father.\nHe also brought a landscape as a specimen of his young efforts, and it\nwas so splendidly done that my father augured a brilliant career for\nthis admirable artist.\n\nI had the pleasure of seeing Sir Waiter Scott on another and, to me, a\nvery memorable occasion.  From an early period of my schoolboy days I\nhad a great regard for every object that had reference to bygone times.\nThey influenced my imagination, and conjured up in my mind dreamy\nvisions of the people of olden days.  It did not matter whether it was\nan old coin or an old castle.  took pleasure in rambling about the old\ncastles near Edinburgh, many of them connected with the times of Mary\nQueen of Scots.  Craigmillar Castle was within a few miles of the city;\nthere was also Crighton Castle, and above all Borthwick Castle.\nThis grand massive old ruin left a deep impression on my mind.\nThe sight of its gloomy interior, with the great hall lighted up only\nby stray glints of sunshine, as if struggling for access through the\nsmall deep-seated windows in its massive walls, together with its\nconnection with the life and times of Queen Mary, had a far greater\ninfluence upon my mind than I experienced while standing amidst the\nColiseum at Rome.\n\nLike many earnest-minded boys, I had a severe attack at the right time\nof life, say from 12 to 15, of what I would call \"the collecting period.\"\nThis consisted, in my case, of accumulating old coins, perhaps one of\nthe most salutary forms of this youthful passion.  I made exchanges\nwith my school companions.  Sometimes my father's friends, seeing my\nanxiety to improve my collection gave me choice specimens of bronze and\nother coins of the Roman emperors, usually duplicates from their own\ncollection.\n\nThese coins had the effect of promoting my knowledge of Roman history.\nI read up in order to find out the acts and deeds of the old rulers of\nthe civilised world.  Besides collecting the coins, I used to make\ncareful drawings of the obverse and reverse faces of each in an\nillustrated catalogue which I kept in my little coin cabinet.\n\nI remember one day, when sitting beside my father making a very careful\ndrawing of a fine bronze coin of Augustus, that Sir Walter Scott\nentered the room.  He frequently called upon my father in order to\nconsult him with respect to his architectural arrangements.  Sir Walter\ncaught sight of me, and came forward to look over the work I was\nengaged in.  At his request I had the pleasure of showing him my little\nstore of coin treasures, after which he took out of his waistcoat\npocket a beautiful silver coin of the reign of Mary Queen of Scots,\nand gave it to me as being his \"young brother antiquarian.\"  I shall\nnever forget the kind fatherly way in which he presented it.\nI considered it a great honour to be spoken to in so friendly a way by\nsuch a man; besides, it vastly enriched my little collection of coins\nand medals.\n\nIt was in the year 1817 that I had the pleasure, never to be forgotten,\nof seeing the great engineer, James Watt.  He was then close upon his\neighty-second year.  His visit to Edinburgh was welcomed by the most\ndistinguished scientific and literary men of the city.  My father had\nthe honour of meeting him at a dinner given by the Earl of Buchan,\nat his residence in George Street.  There were present, Sir James Hall,\nPresident of the Royal Society; Francis Jeffrey, Editor of the\nEdinburgh Review; Walter Scott, still the Great Unknown; and many other\ndistinguished notabilities.  The cheerful old man delighted them with\nhis kindly talk, as well as astonished them with the extent and\nprofundity of his information.\n\nOn the following day Mr. Watt paid my father a visit he carefully\nexamined his artistic and other works.  Having inspected with great\npleasure some landscape paintings of various scenes in Scotland\nexecuted by my sisters, who were then highly efficient artists,\nhe purchased a specimen of each, as well as three landscapes painted by\nmy father, as a record of his pleasant visit to the capital of his\nnative country.  I well remember the sight I then got of the Great\nEngineer.  I had just returned from the High School when he was leaving\nmy father's house.  It was but a glimpse I had of him.  But his\nbenevolent countenance and his tall but bent figure made an impression\non my mind that I can never forget.  It was even something to have seen\nfor a few seconds so truly great and noble a man.\n\nI did not long continue my passion for the collection of coins, I felt\na greater interest in mechanical pursuits.  I have a most cherished and\ngrateful remembrance of the happy hours and days that I spent in my\nfather's workroom.  When the weather was cold or wet ,he took refuge\nwith his lathe and tools, and there I followed and watched him.\nHe took the greatest pleasure in instructing me.  Even in the most\nhumble mechanical job he was sure to direct my attention to the action\nof the tools and to the construction of the work he had in hand,\nand pointed out the manipulative processes requisite for its being\neffectually carried out.  My hearty zeal in assisting him was well\nrewarded by his implanting in my mind the great fundamental principles\non which the practice of engineering in its grandest forms is based.\nBut I did not learn this all at once.  It came only gradually, and by\ndint of constant repetition and inculcation.  In the meantime I made a\nbeginning by doing some little mechanical work on my own account.\n\nWhile attending the High School, from 1817 to 1820, there was the usual\nrage amongst boys for spinning-tops, \"peeries,\" and \"young cannon.\"\nBy means of my father's excellent foot-lathe I turned out the\nspinning-tops in capital style, so much so that I be came quite noted\namongst my school companions.  They all wanted to have specimens of my\nproductions.  They would give any price for them.  The peeries were\nturned with perfect accuracy, and the steel shod, or spinning pivot,\nwas centred so as to correspond exactly with the axis of the top.\nThey could spin twice as long as the bought peeries.  When at full\nspeed they would \"sleep,\" that is, revolve without the slightest\nwaving.  This was considered high art as regarded top-spinning.\n\nFlying-kites and tissue paper balloons were articles that I was\nsomewhat famed for producing.  There was a good deal of special skill\nrequired for the production of a flying-kite.  It must be perfectly\nstill and steady when at its highest flight in the air.\nPaper messengers were sent up to it along the string which held it to\nthe ground.  The top of the Calton Hill was the most favourite place\nfor enjoying this pleasant amusement.\n\nAnother article for which I became equally famous was the manufacture\nof small brass cannon.  These I cast and bored, and mounted on their\nappropriate gun-carriages.  They proved very effective, especially in\nthe loudness of the report when fired.  I also converted large\ncellar-keys into a sort of hand-cannon.  A touch-hole was bored into\nthe barrel of the key, with a sliding brass collar that allowed the\nkey-guns to be loaded and primed and ready for firing.  The principal\noccasion on which the brass cannon and hand-guns were used was on the\n4th of June--King George the Thirds birthday.  This was always\ncelebrated with exuberant and noisy loyalty.  The guns of the Castle\nwere fired at noon, and the number of shots corresponded with the\nnumber of years that the king had reigned.  The grand old Castle was\nenveloped in smoke, and the discharges reverberated along the streets\nand among the surrounding hills.  Everything was in holiday order.\nThe coaches were hung with garlands, the shops were ornamented,\nthe troops were reviewed on Bruntsfield Links, and the citizens drank\nthe king's health at the Gross, throwing the glasses over their\nshoulders.  The boys fired off gunpowder, or threw squibs or crackers\nfrom morning till night.  It was one of the greatest schoolboy events\nof the year.  My little brass cannon and hand-guns were very busy\nduring that day.  They were fired until they became quite hot.\nThese were the pre-lucifer days.  The fire to light the powder at the\ntouch-hole was obtained by the use of a flint, a steel, and a tinder-box.\nThe flint was struck sharply on the steel; a spark of fire fell into\nthe tinderbox, and the match of hemp string, soaked in saltpetre,\nwas readily lit, and fired off the little guns.\n\nI carried on quite a trade in forging beautiful little steels.\nI forged them out of old files, which proved excellent material for the\npurpose.  I filed them up into neat and correct forms, and then\nhardened and tempered them, secundum artem, at the little furnace stove\nin my father's workroom, where of course there were also a suitable\nanvil, hammer, and tongs.  I often made potent use of these steels in\nescaping from the ordeal of some severe task imposed upon me at school.\nThe schoolmaster often deputed his authority to the monitors to hear us\nsay our lessons.  But when I slyly exhibited a beautiful steel the\nmonitor could not maintain his grim sense of duty, and he often let me\nescape the ordeal of repeating some passage from a Latin school-book by\nobtaining possession of the article.  I thus bought myself off.\nThis system of bribery and corruption was no doubt shockingly improper,\nbut as I was not naturally endowed with the taste for learning Latin\nand Greek, I continued my little diplomatic tricks until I left school.\n\nAs I have said, I did not learn much at the High School.  My mind was\nnever opened up by what was taught me there.  It was a mere matter of\nrote and cram.  I learnt by heart a number of Latin rules and phrases,\nbut what I learnt soon slipped from my memory.  My young mind was\ntormented by the tasks set before me.  At the same time my hungry mind\nthirsted for knowledge of another kind.\n\nThere was one thing, however, that I did learn at the High School. That\nwas the blessings and advantages of friendship.  There were several of\nmy schoolfellows of a like disposition with myself, with whom I formed\nattachments which ended only with life.  I may mention two of them in\nparticular--Jemmy Patterson and Tom Smith.  The former was the son of\none of the largest iron founders in Edinburgh. He was kind, good, and\nintelligent.  He and I were great cronies.  He took me to his father's\nworkshops.  Nothing could have been more agreeable to my tastes.\nFor there I saw how iron castings were made. Mill-work and\nsteam-engines were repaired there, and I could see the way in which\npower was produced and communicated.  To me it was a most instructive\nschool of practical mechanics.  Although I was only about thirteen at\nthe time, I used to \"lend a hand,\" in which hearty zeal made up for\nwant of strength.  I look back to these days, especially to the\nSaturday afternoons spent in the workshops of this admirably conducted\niron foundry, as a most important part of my education as a mechanical\nengineer.  I did not read about such things; for words were of little\nuse.  But I saw and handled, and thus all the ideas in connection with\nthem became permanently rooted in my mind.\n\nEach department of the iron foundry was superintended by an able and\nintelligent man, who was distinguished not only by his ability but\nfor his steadiness and sobriety.  The men were for the most part\npromoted to their fore-manship from the ranks, and had been brought\nup in the workshop from their boyhood.  They possessed a strong\nindividuality of character, and served their employer faithfully and\nloyally.  One of these excellent men, with whom I was frequently\nbrought into contact, was William Watson.  He took special charge of\nall that related to the construction and repairs of steam-engines,\nwater-wheels, and mill-work generally.  He was a skilful designer and\ndraughtsman, and an excellent pattern maker.  His designs were drawn\nin a bold and distinct style, on large deal boards, and were passed\ninto the hands of the mechanics to be translated by them into actual\nwork.  It was no small privilege to me to stand by, and now and then\nhold the end of the long straight edge, or by some humble but zealous\ngenuine help of mine contribute to the progress of these substantial\nand most effective mechanical drawings.  Watson explained to me,\nin the most common-sense manner, his reasons for the various forms,\narrangements, and proportions of the details of his designs.  He was\nan enthusiast on the subject of Euclid; and to see the beautiful\nproblems applied by him in working out his excellent drawings was to me\na lesson beyond all price.\n\nWatson was effectively assisted by his two sons, who carried out their\nfather's designs in constructing the wood patterns after which the\nfoundry-men or moulders reproduced their forms in cast iron, while the\nsmiths by their craft realised the wrought-iron portions. Those sons of\nMr. Watson were of that special class of workmen called millwrights--\na class now almost extinct, though many of the best known engineers\noriginally belonged to them.  They could work with equal effectiveness\nin wood or iron.\n\nAnother foreman in Mr. Patterson's foundry was called Lewis.  He had\nspecial charge of the iron castings designed for architectural and\nornamental purposes.  He was a man of great taste and artistic\nfeeling, and I was able even at that time to appreciate the beauty of\nhis designs.  One of the most original characters about the foundry,\nhowever, was Johnie Syme.  He took charge of the old Boulton and Watt\nsteam-engine, which gave motion to the machinery of the works.\nIt also produced the blast for the Cupolas, in which the pig and cast\niron scrap was daily melted and cast into the various objects produced\nin the foundry.  Johnie was a complete incarnation of technical\nknowledge.  He was the Jack-of-all-trades of the establishment;\nand the standing counsel in every out-of-the-way case of managing and\novercoming mechanical difficulties.  He was the superintendent of the\nboring machines.  In those days the boring of a steam-engine cylinder\nwas considered high art in excelsis!  Patterson's firm was celebrated\nfor the accuracy of its boring.\n\nI owe Johnie Syme a special debt of gratitude, as it was he who first\ninitiated me into that most important of all technical processes in\npractical mechanism--the art of hardening and temperinq steel.\nIt is, perhaps, not saying too much to assert that the successful\npractice of the mechanical arts, by means of which man rises from the\nsavage to the civilised state, is due to that wonderful change.\nMan began with wood, and stone, and bone; he proceeded to bronze and\niron; but it was only by means of hardened steel that he could\naccomplish anything in arms, in agriculture, or in architecture.\nThe instant hardening which occurs on plunging a red-hot piece of steel\ninto cold water may well be described as mysterious.  Even in these\ndays, when science has defined the causes of so many phenomena,\nthe reason of steel becoming hard on suddenly cooling it down from a\nred-heat, is a fact that no one has yet explained.  The steel may be\ntempered by modifying the degree of heat to which it is afterwards\nsubjected.  It may thus be toughened by slightly reheating the hardened\nsteel; the resoftening course is indicated by certain prismatic tints,\nwhich appear in a peculiar order of succession on its surface.\nThe skilful artisan thus knows by experience the exact point at which\nit is necessary again to plunge it into cold water in order to secure\nthe requisite combination of toughness and hardness to the steel\nrequired for his purposes.\n\nIn all these matters, my early instructor, Johnie Syme, gave me such\ninformation as proved of the greatest use to me in the after progress\nof my mechanical career.  Johnie Syme was also the very incarnation of\nquaint sly humour; and when communicating some of his most valued\narcana of practical mechanical knowledge he always reminded me of some\nof Ostade's Dutchmen, by an almost indescribable sly humorous twinkle\nof the eye, which in that droll way stamped his information on my\nmemory.\n\nTom Smith was another of my attached cronies.  Our friendship began at\nthe High School in 1818.  Our similarity of disposition bound us\ntogether.  Smith was the son of an enterprising general merchant at\nLeith.  His father had a special genius for practical chemistry.\nHe had established an extensive colour manufactory at Portobello, near\nEdinburgh, where he produced white lead, red lead, and a great variety\nof colours--in the preparation of which he required a thorough\nknowledge of chemistry.Tom Smith inherited his father's tastes, and\nadmitted me to share in his experiments, which were carried on in a\nchemical laboratory situated behind his father's house at the bottom of\nLeith Walk.\n\nWe had a special means of communication.  When anything particular was\ngoing on at the laboratory, Tom hoisted a white flag on the top of a\nhigh pole in his father's garden.  Though I was more than a mile apart,\nI kept a look-out in the direction of the laboratory with a spy-glass.\nMy father's house was at the top of Leith Walk, and Smith's house was\nat the bottom of it.  When the flag was hoisted I could clearly see the\ninvitation to me to \"come down.\"  I was only too glad to run down the\nWalk and join my chum, and take part with him in some interesting\nchemical process.  Mr. Smith, the father, made me heartily welcome.\nHe was pleased to see his son so much attached to me, and he perhaps\nbelieved that I was worthy of his friendship.  We took zealous part in\nall the chemical proceedings, and in that way Tom was fitting himself\nfor the business of his life.\n\nMr. Smith was a most genial tempered man.  He was shrewd and\nquick-witted, like a native of York, as he was.  I received the\ngreatest kindness from him as well as from his family.  His house was\nlike a museum.  It was full of cabinets, in which were placed choice\nand interesting objects in natural history, geology, mineralogy, and\nmetallurgy.  All were represented.  Many of these specimens had been\nbrought to him from abroad by his ship captains who transported his\ncolour manufactures and other commodities to foreign parts.\n\nMy friend Tom Smith and I made it a rule--and in this we were\nencouraged by his father--that, so far as was possible, we ourselves\nshould actually make the acids and other substances used in our\nexperiments.  We were not to buy them ready made, as this would have\ntaken the zest out of our enjoyment.  We should have lost the pleasure\nand instruction of producing them by aid of our own wits and energies.\nTo encounter and overcome a difficulty is the most interesting of all\nthings.  Hence, though often baffled, we eventually produced perfect\nspecimens of nitrous, nitric, and muriatic acids.  We distilled alcohol\nfrom duly fermented sugar and water, and rectified the resultant spirit\nfrom fusel oil by passing the alcoholic vapour through animal charcoal\nbefore it entered the worm of the still.  We converted part of the\nalcohol into sulphuric ether.  We produced phosphorus from bones,\nand elaborated many of the mysteries of chemistry.\n\nThe amount of practical information which we obtained by this system of\nmaking our own chemical agents was such as to reward us, in many\nrespects, for the labour we underwent.  To outsiders it might appear a\nvery troublesome and roundabout way of getting at the finally desired\nresult.  But I feel certain that there is no better method of rooting\nchemical or any other instruction, deeply in our minds.  Indeed, I\nregret that the same system is not pursued by young men of the present\nday.  They are seldom, if ever, called upon to exert their own wits and\nindustry to obtain the requisites for their instruction.  A great deal\nis now said about \"technical education\"; but how little there is of\ntechnical handiness or head work!  Everything is bought ready made to\ntheir hands; and hence there is no call for individual ingenuity.\n\nI often observe, in shop-windows, every detail of model ships and model\nsteam-engines, supplied ready made for those who are \"said to be\" of an\ningenious and mechanical turn.  Thus the vital uses of resourcefulness\nare done away with, and a sham exhibition of mechanical genius is\nparaded before you by the young impostors--the result, for the most\npart, of too free a supply of pocket money.  I have known too many\ninstances of parents, led by such false evidence of constructive skill,\napprenticing their sons to some engineering firm; and, after paying\nvast sums, finding out that the pretender comes out of the engineering\nshop with no other practical accomplishment than that of cigar-smoking!\n\nThe truth is that the eyes and the fingers--the bare fingers--are\nthe two principal inlets to sound practical instruction.  They are the\nchief sources of trustworthy knowledge as to all the materials and\noperations which the engineer has to deal with, No book knowledge can\navail for that purpose.  The nature and properties of the materials\nmust come in through the finger ends.  Hence, I have no faith in young\nengineers who are addicted to wearing gloves.  Gloves, especially kid\ngloves, are perfect non-conductors of technical knowledge.\nThis has really more to do with the efficiency of young aspirants for\nengineering success than most people are aware of!\n\n\nCHAPTER 6.   Mechanical Beginnings.\n\nI left the High School at the end of 1820.  I carried with me a small\namount of Latin, and no Greek.  I do not think I was much the better\nfor my small acquaintance with the dead languages.  I wanted something\nmore living and quickening.  I continued my studies at private classes.\nArithmetic and geometry were my favourite branches.The three first\nbooks of Euclid were to me a new intellectual life.  They brought out\nmy power of reasoning.  They trained me mentally.  They enabled me to\narrive at correct conclusions, and to acquire a knowledge of absolute\ntruths.  It is because of this that I have ever since held the\nbeautifully perfect method of reasoning, as exhibited in the exact\nmethod of arriving at Q.E.D., to be one of the most satisfactory\nefforts and exercises of the human intellect.\n\nBesides visiting and taking part in the works at Patterson's foundry,\nand joining in the chemical experiments at Smith's laboratory, my\nfather gave me every opportunity for practising the art of drawing.\nHe taught me to sketch with exactness every object, whether natural or\nartificial, so as to enable the hand to accurately reproduce what the\neye had seen.  In order to acquire this almost invaluable art, which\ncan serve so many valuable purposes in life, he was careful to educate\nmy eye, so that I might perceive the relative proportions of the\nobjects placed before me.  He would throw down at random a number of\nbricks, or pieces of wood representing them, and set me to copy their\nforms, their proportions, their lights and shadows respectively.\n\nI have often heard him say that any one who could make a correct\ndrawing in regard to outline, and also indicate by a few effective\ntouches the variation of lights and shadows of such a group of model\nobject's, might not despair of making a good and correct sketch of the\nexterior of York Minster!\n\nMy father was an enthusiast in praise of this graphic language,\nand I have followed his example.  In fact, it formed a principal part\nof my own education.  It gave me the power of recording observations\nwith a few graphic strokes of the pencil, which far surpassed in\nexpression any number of mere words.  This graphic eloquence is one\nof the highest gifts in conveying clear and correct ideas as to the\nforms of objects--whether they be those of a simple and familiar\nkind, or of some form of mechanical construction, or of the details of\nfine building, or the characteristic features of a wide-stretching\nlandscape.  This accomplishment of accurate drawing, which I achieved\nfor the most part in my father's work-room, served me many a good turn\nin future years with reference to the engineering work which became the\nbusiness of my life.\n\nI was constantly busy.  Mind, hands, and body were kept in a state of\ndelightful and instructive activity.  When not drawing, I occupied\nmyself in my father's workshop at the lathe, the furnace, or the bench.\nI gradually became initiated into every variety of mechanical and\nchemical manipulation.  I made my own tools and constructed my chemical\napparatus, as far as lay in my power.  With respect to the latter,\nI constructed a very handy and effective blowpipe apparatus, consisting\nof a small air force-pump, connected with a cylindrical vessel of tin\nplate.  By means of an occasional use of the handy pump, it yielded\nsuch a fine steady blowpipe blast, as enabled me to bend glass tubes\nand blow bulbs for thermometers, to analyse metals or mineral substances,\nor to do any other work for which intense heat was necessary.\nMy natural aptitude for manipulation, whether in mechanical or chemical\noperations, proved very serviceable to myself as well as to others;\nand (as will be shown hereafter) it gained for me the friendship of\nmany distinguished scientific men.\n\nBut I did not devote myself altogether to experiments.  Exercise is\nas necessary for the body as the mind.  Without full health a man\ncannot enjoy comfort, nor can he possess endurance.  I therefore took\nplenty of exercise out of doors.  I accompanied my father in his walks\nround Edinburgh.  My intellect was kept alive during these delightful\nexcursions.  For sometimes my father was accompanied by brother-artists,\nwhose conversation is always so attractive; and sometimes by scientific\nmen, such as Sir James Hall, Professor Leslie, Dr. Brewster, and others.\nWhatever may have been my opportunities for education so-called,\nnothing could have better served the purpose of real education\n(the evolution of the mental faculties) than the opportunities I\nenjoyed while accompanying and listening to the conversation of men\ndistinguished for their originality of thought and their high\nintellectual capacity.  This was a mental culture of the best kind.\n\nThe volcanic origin of the beautiful scenery round Edinburgh was often\nthe subject of their conversation.  Probably few visitors are aware\nthat all those remarkable eminences, which give to the city and its\nsurroundings so peculiar and romantic an aspect, are the results of the\noperation, during inconceivably remote ages, of volcanic force\npenetrating the earth's crust by disruptive power, and pouring forth\nstreams of molten lava, now shrunk and cooled into volcanic rock.\nThe observant eye, opened by the light of Science, can see unmistakable\nevidences of a condition of things which were in action at periods so\nremote as, in comparison, to shrink up the oldest of human records into\nevents of yesterday.\n\nI had often the privilege of standing by and hearing the philosophic\nLeslie, Brewster, and Hall, discussing these volcanic remains in their\nactual presence; sometimes at Arthur's Seat or on the Calton Hill,\nor at the rock on which Edinburgh Castle stands, Their observations\nsank indelibly into my memory, and gave me the key to the origin of\nthis grand class of terrestrial phenomena.  When standing at the\n\"Giant's Ribs,\" on the south side of Arthur's Seat, I felt as if one\nof the grandest pages of the earth's history lay open before me.\nThe evidences of similar volcanic action abound in many other places\nnear Edinburgh; and they may be traced right across Scotland from the\nBass Rock to Fingal's Cave, the Giant's Causeway in Antrim, and Slievh\nLeague on the south-west coast of Donegal in Ireland.\n\nVolcanic action, in some inconceivably remote period of the earth's\ncrust history, has been the Plough, and after denudation by water,\nhas been the Harrow, by which the originally deep-seated mineral\ntreasures of the globe have been brought within the reach of man's\nindustrial efforts.  It has thus yielded him inexhaustible mineral\nharvests, and helped him to some of the most important material\nelements in his progress towards civilisation.  It is from this\nconsideration that, while enjoying the results of these grand\nfundamental actions of the Creator's mighty agencies in their\npicturesque aspect, the knowledge of their useful results to man adds\nvastly to the grandeur of the contemplation of their aspect and nature.\nThis great subject caused me, even at this early period of my life, to\nbehold with special interest the first peep at the structure of the\nmoon's surface, as revealed to me by an excellent Ramsden \"spy-glass,\"\nwhich my father possessed, and thus planted the seed of that earnest\ndesire to scrutinise more minutely the moon's wonderful surface, which\nin after years I pursued by means of the powerful reflecting telescopes\nconstructed by myself.\n\nTo turn to another subject.  In 1822 the loyalty of Scotland was\ngreatly excited when George the Fourth paid his well-known visit to\nEdinburgh.  It was then the second greatest city in the kingdom,\nand had not been visited by royalty for about 170 years.  The civic\nauthorities, and the inhabitants generally, exerted themselves to the\nutmost to give the king a cordial welcome, in spite of a certain\nfeeling of dissatisfaction as to his personal character.  The recent\ntrial and death of Queen Caroline had not been forgotten, yet all such\nrecollections were suppressed in the earnest desire to show every\nrespect to the royal visitor.  Edinburgh was crowded with people from\nall parts of the country; heather was arrayed on every bonnet and hat;\nand the reception was on the whole magnificent.  Perhaps the most\nimpressive spectacle was the orderliness of the multitude, all arrayed\nin their Sunday clothes.  The streets, windows; and house-tops were\ncrowded; and the Calton Hill, Salisbury Crags, and even Arthur's Seat\nit self, were covered with people.  On the night before the arrival a\ngigantic bonfire on Arthur's Seat lit up with a tremendous blaze the\nwhole city, as well as the surrounding country.  It formed a\nmagnificent and picturesque sight, illuminating the adjacent mountains\nas well as the prominent features of the city.  It made one imagine\nthat the grand old volcanic mountain had once more, after a rest of\nsome hundreds of thousands of years, burst out again in its former\nvehemence of eruptive activity.\n\nThere were, of course, many very distinguished men who took part in the\npageant of the king's entry into Edinburgh, but none of them had their\npresence more cordially acknowledged than Sir Walter Scott, who never\nfelt more proud of \"his own romantic town\" than he did upon this\noccasion.  It is unnecessary to mention the many interesting features\nof the royal reception.  The king's visit lasted for seven or eight\ndays, and everything passed off loyally, orderly, happily,\nand successfully.\n\nShortly after this time there was a great deal of distress among the\nlabouring classes.  All the manufacturing towns were short of\nemployment, and the weavers and factory workers were thrown upon the\npublic.  Many of the workmen thought that politics were the causes of\ntheir suffering.  Radical clubs were formed, and the Glasgow weavers\nbegan to drill at nights in the hopes of setting things to rights by\nmeans of physical force.  A large number of the starving weavers came\nto Edinburgh.  A committee was formed, and contributions were\ncollected, for the purpose of giving them temporary employment.\nThey were set to work to make roads and walks round the Calton Hill and\nCrags.  The fine walk immediately under the precipitous crags, which\nopens out such perfect panoramic views of Edinburgh, was made by these\npoor fellows.  It was hard work for their delicate hands and fingers,\nwhich before had been accustomed only to deal with threads and soft\nfabrics.  They were very badly suited for handling the mattock, shovel,\nand hand-barrow.  The result of their labours, however, proved of great\nadvantage to Edinburgh in opening up the beauties of its scenery.\nThe road round the crags is still called \"The Radical Road.\"\n\nLet me here mention one of the most memorable incidents of the year\n1824.  I refer to the destructive fire which took place in the old town\nof Edinburgh.  It broke out in an apartment situated in one of the\nhighest piles of houses in the High Street.  In spite of every effort\nof the firemen the entire pile was gutted and destroyed.  The fire was\nthought to be effectually arrested; but towards the afternoon of the\nnext day smoke was observed issuing from the upper part of the steeple\nof the Tron Church.  The  steeple was built of timber, covered with\nlead.  There is never smoke but there is fire; and at last the flames\nburst forth.  The height of the spire was so lofty that all attempts to\nextinguish the fire were hopeless.  The lead was soon melted, and\nrushed in streams into the street below.  At length the whole steeple\nfell down with a frightful crash.\n\nI happened to see the first outbreak of this extraordinary fire, and I\nwatched its progress to its close.  Burning embers were carried by the\nwind and communicated the fire to neighbouring houses.  The last\noutburst took place one night about ten.  All the fire-engines of\nEdinburgh and the neighbourhood were collected round the buildings,\nand played water upon the flames, but without effect.  Whole ranges of\nlofty old houses were roaring with fire.  In the course of two or three\nhours, several acres, covered by the loftiest and most densely crowded\nhouses in the High Street, were in a blaze.  Some of them were of\nthirteen stories.  Floor after floor came crashing down, throwing out a\nblaze of embers.  The walls of each house acted as an enormous chimney\n--the windows acting as draught-holes.  The walls, under the intense\nheat, were fluxed and melted into a sort of glass.  The only method of\nstopping the progress of the fire was to pull down the neighbouring\nhouses, so as to isolate the remaining parts of the High Street.\n\nAs the parapet of the grand old tower of the High Church, St. Giles,\nwas near the site of the fire,--so near as to enable one to look down\ninto it,--my father obtained permission to ascend, and I with him.\nWhen we emerged from the long dark spiral stairs on to the platform on\nthe top of the tower, we found a select party of the most distinguished\ninhabitants looking down into the vast area of fire; and prominent\namong them was Sir Walter Scott.  At last, after three days of\ntremendous efforts, the fire was subdued; but not till after a terrible\ndestruction of property.  The great height of the ruined remains of the\npiles of houses rendered it impossible to have them removed by the\nordinary means.  After several fruitless attempts with chains and\nropes, worked by capstans, to pull them down, gunpowder was at last\nresorted to.  Mines were dug under each vast pile; one or two barrels\nof gunpowder were placed into them and fired; and then the before solid\nmasses came tumbling down amidst clouds of dust.  The management of\nthis hazardous but eventually safe process was conducted by Captain\nBasil Ball.  He ordered a crew of sailors to be brought up from the\nman-of-war guardship in the Firth of Forth; and by their united efforts\nthe destruction of the ruined walls was at last successfully\naccomplished.\n\nIn the autumn of 1823, when I was fifteen years old, I had a most\ndelightful journey with my father.  It was the first occasion on which\nI had been a considerable distance from home.  And yet the journey was\nonly to Stirling.  My father had received a commission to paint a view\nof the castle as seen from the ruins of Cambuskenneth Abbey, situated a\nfew miles from the town.  We started from Newhaven by a small steamboat,\npassing, on our way up the Firth, Queensferry, Culross, and Alloa.\nWe then entered the windings of the river, from which I saw the Ochils,\na noble range of bright green mountains.  The passage of the steamer\nthrough the turns and windings of the Forth was most interesting.\n\nWe arrived at Stirling, and at once proceeded to Cambuskenneth Abbey,\nwhere there was a noble old Gothic tower.  This formed the foreground\nof my father's careful sketch, with Stirling Castle in the background,\nand Ben Lomond with many other of the Highland mountains in the\ndistance.  As my father wished to make a model of the Gothic tower,\nhe desired me to draw it carefully, and to take the dimensions of all\nthe chief parts as well as to make detailed sketches of its minor\narchitectural features.  It was a delightful autumn afternoon, and,\nbefore the day had closed, our work at the abbey was done.  We returned\nto Stirling and took a walk round the castle to see the effect of the\nsun setting behind the Highland mountains.\n\nNext morning we visited the castle.  I was much interested with the\ninterior, especially with a beautifully decorated Gothic oratory or\nprivate chapel, used by the Scottish kings when they resided at\nStirling.  The oratory had been converted with great taste into an\nante-drawingroom of the governor's house.  The exquisite decorations of\nthis chapel*\n [footnote...\nThis exquisite specimen of a carved oak Gothic apartment had a terrible\nincident in Scottish history connected with it.  It was in this place\nthat The Douglas intruded his presence on James the Third.  He urged\nhis demands in a violent and threatening manner, and afterwards laid\nhands upon the king.  The latter, in defending himself with his dagger,\nwounded the Douglas mortally; and to get rid of the body the king cast\nit out of the window of the chapel, where it fell down the precipitous\nrock underneath.  The chapel has since been destroyed by fire.\n ...]\nwere the first specimens of Gothic carving in oak that I had ever seen,\nand they seemed to put our modern carvings to shame.  The Great Hall,\nwhere the Scottish Parliament used to meet, was also very interesting\nas connected with the ancient history of the country.\n\nFrom Stirling we walked to Alloa, passing the picturesque cascades\nrushing down the cleft's of the Ochils.  We put up for the night at\nClackmannan, a very decayed and melancholy-looking village, though it\npossessed a fine specimen of the Scottish castellated tower.  It is\nsaid that Robert Bruce slept here before the Battle of Bannockburn.\nBut the most interesting thing that I saw during the journey was the\nDevon Ironworks.  I had read and heard about the processes carried on\nthere in smelting iron ore and running it into pig-iron.  The origin of\nthe familiar trade term \"pig-iron\" is derived from the result of the\narrangement most suitable for distributing the molten iron as it rushes\nforth from the opening made at the bottom part of the blast-furnace;\nwhen, after its reduction from the ore, it collects in a fluid mass of\nseveral tons weight.  Previous to \"tapping\" the furnace a great central\nchannel is made in the sand-covered floor of the forge; this central\nchannel is then subdivided into many lateral branches or canals, into\nwhich the molten iron flows, and eventually hardens.\n\nThe great steam-engine that worked the blast furnace was the largest I\nhad ever seen.  A singular expedient was employed at these works, of\nusing a vast vault hewn in the solid rock of the hillside for the\npurpose of storing up the blast produced by the engines, and so\nequalising the pressure; thus turning a mountain side into a reservoir\nfor the use of a blast-furnace.  This seemed to me a daring and\nwonderful engineering feat.\n\nWe waited at the works until the usual time had arrived for letting out\nthe molten iron which had been accumulating at the lower part of the\nblast-furnace.  It was a fine sight to see the stream of white-hot iron\nflowing like water into the large gutter immediately before the\nopening.  From this the molten iron flowed on until it filled the\nmoulds of sand which branched off from the central gutter.  The iron\nleft in the centre, when cooled and broken up, was called sow metal,\nwhile that in the branches was called pig iron; the terms being derived\nfrom the appearance of a sow engaged in its maternal duties.\nThe pig-iron is thus cast in handy-sized pieces for the purpose of\nbeing transported to other iron foundries; while the clumsy sow metal\nis broken up and passes through another process of melting, or is\nreserved for foundry uses at the works where it is produced.\nAfter inspecting with great pleasure the machinery connected with the\nfoundry, we took our leave and returned to Edinburgh by steamer from\nAlloa.\n\nShortly after, I had the good fortune to make the acquaintance of\nRobert Bald, the well-known mining engineer.  He was one of the most\nkind-hearted men I have ever known.  He was always ready to communicate\nhis knowledge to young and old.  His sound judgment and long practical\nexperience in regard to coal-mining and the various machinery connected\nwith it, rendered him a man of great importance in the northern\ncounties, where his advice was eagerly sought for. Besides his special\nknowledge, he had a large acquaintance with literature and science.\nHe was bright, lively, and energetic.  He was a living record of good\nstories, and in every circle in which he moved he was the focus of\ncheerfulness.  In fact, there was no greater social favourite in\nEdinburgh than Robert Bald.\n\nBald was very fond of young people, and he became much attached to me.\nHe used to come to my father's house, and often came in to see what I\nwas about in the work-room.  He was rejoiced to see the earnest and\nindustrious manner in which I was employed, in preparing myself for my\nproposed business as an engineer.  He looked over my tools, mostly of\nmy own making, and gave me every encouragement.  When he had any\nvisitors he usually brought them and introduced them to me.  In this\nway I had the happiness to make the acquaintance of Robert Napier,\nNelson, and Cook, of Glasgow; and in after life I continued to enjoy\ntheir friendship.  It would be difficult for me to detail the acts of\ntrue disinterested kindness which I continued to receive from this\nadmirable man.\n\nOn several occasions he wished me to accompany him on his business\njourneys, in order that I might see some works that would supply me\nwith valuable information.  He had designed a powerful pumping engine\nto drain more effectually a large colliery district situated near\nBannockburn--close to the site of the great battle in the time of\nRobert the Bruce.  He invited me to join him.  It was with the greatest\npleasure that I accepted his invitation; for there would be not only\nthe pleasure of seeing a noble piece of steam machinery brought into\naction for the first time, but also the enjoyment of visiting the\ncelebrated Carron Ironworks.\n\nThe Carron Ironworks are classic ground to engineers.  They are\nassociated with the memory of Roebuck, Watt, and Miller of Dalswinton.\nFor there Roebuck and Watt began the first working steam-engine; Miller\napplied the steam-engine to the purposes of navigation, and invented\nthe Carronade gun.  The works existed at an early period in the history\nof British iron manufacture.  Much of the machinery continued to be of\nwood.  Although effective in a general way it was monstrously cumbrous.\nIt gave the idea of vast power and capability of resistance, while it\nwas far from being so in reality. It was, however, truly imposing and\nimpressive in its effect upon strangers.  When seen partially lit up by\nthe glowing masses of white-hot iron, with only the rays of bright\nsunshine gleaming through a few holes in the roof, and the dark, black,\nsmoky vaults in which the cumbrous machinery was heard rumbling away in\nthe distance--while the moving parts were dimly seen through the\nmurky atmosphere, mixed with the sounds of escaping steam and rushes of\nwater; with the half-naked men darting about with masses of red-hot\niron and ladles full of molten cast-iron--it made a powerful\nimpression upon the mind.\n\nI was afterwards greatly interested by a collection of old armour, dug\nup from the field of the Battle of Bannockburn close at hand. They were\narranged on the walls of the house of the manager of the Carron\nIronworks.  There were swords, daggers, lances, battle-axes, shields,\nand coats of chain-armour.  Some of the latter were whole, others in\nfragmentary portions.  I was particularly interested with the admirable\nworkmanship of the coats of mail.  The iron links extended from the\ncovering of the head to the end of the arms, and from the shoulders\ndown to the hips, in one linked iron fabric.  The beauty and exactness\nwith which this chain-armour had been forged and built up were truly\nwonderful.  There must have been \"giants in those days.\"  This grand\nstyle of armour was in use from the time of the Conquest, and was most\neffective in the way of protection, as it was fitted by its flexibility\nto give full play to the energetic action of the wearer.  It was\ninfinitely superior to the senseless plate-armour that was used, at a\nsubsequent period, to encase soldiers like lobsters.  The chain-armour\nI saw at Carron left a deep impression on my mind.  I never see a bit\nof it, or of its representation in the figures on our grand tombs of\nthe thirteenth century, but I think of my first sight of it at Carron\nand of the tremendous conflict at Bannockburn.\n\nRemembering, also, the impressive sight of the picturesque fire-lit\nhalls, and the terrible-looking, cumbrous machinery which I first\nbeheld on a grand scale at Carron, I have often regretted that some of\nour artists do not follow up the example set them by that admirable\npainter, Wright of Derby, and treat us to the pictures of some of our\ngreat ironworks.  They not only abound with the elements of the\npicturesque in its highest sense, but also set forth the glory of the\nuseful arts in such a way as would worthily call forth the highest\npower of our artists.\n\nTo return to my life at Edinburgh.  I was now seventeen years old.\nI had acquired a considerable amount of practical knowledge as to the\nuse and handling of mechanical tools, and I desired to turn it to some\naccount.  I was able to construct working models of steam-engines and\nother apparatus required for the illustration of mechanical subjects.\nI began with making a small working steam engine for the purpose of\ngrinding the oil-colours used by my father in his artistic work.\nThe result was quite satisfactory.  Many persons came to see my active\nlittle steam-engine at work, and they were so pleased with it that I\nreceived several orders for small workshop engines, and also for some\nmodels of steam-engines to illustrate the subjects taught at Mechanics'\nInstitutions.\n\n[Image]  Sectional model of condensing steam-engine.  By James Nasmyth\n\nI contrived a sectional model of a complete condensing steam-engine of\nthe beam and parallel motion construction.  The model, as seen from one\nside, exhibited every external detail in full and due action when the\nflywheel was moved round by hand; while, on the other or sectional\nside, every detail of the interior was seen, with the steam-valves and\nair-pump, as well as the motion of the piston in the cylinder, with the\nconstruction of the piston and the stuffing box, together with the\nslide-valve and steam passages, all in due position and relative\nmovement.\n\nThe first of these sectional models of the steam-engine was made for\nthe Edinburgh School of Arts, where its uses in instructing mechanics\nand others in the application of steam were highly appreciated.\nThe second was made for Professor Leslie, of the Edinburgh University,\nfor use in his lectures on Natural Philosophy.  The professor had,\nat his own private cost, provided a complete and excellent set of\napparatus, which, for excellent workmanship and admirable utility,\nhad never, I believe, been provided for the service of any university.\nHe was so pleased with my addition to his class-room apparatus, that,\nbesides expressing his great thanks for my services, he most handsomely\npresented me with a free ticket to his Natural Philosophy class as a\nregular student, so long as it suited me to make use of his instruction.\nBut far beyond this, as a reward for my earnest endeavours to satisfy\nthis truly great philosopher, was the kindly manner in which he on all\noccasions communicated to me conversationally his original and masterly\nviews on the great fundamental principles of Natural Philosophy--\nespecially as regarded the principles of Dynamics and the Philosophy of\nMechanics. The clear views which he communicated in his conversation,\nas well as in his admirable lectures, vividly illustrated by the\nexperiments which he had originated, proved of great advantage to me;\nand I had every reason to consider his friendship and his teaching as\namongst the most important elements in my future success as a practical\nengineer.\n\nHaving referred to the Edinburgh School of Arts, I feel it necessary to\nsay something about the origin of that excellent institution.\nA committee of the most distinguished citizens of Edinburgh was formed\nfor the purpose of instituting a college in which working men and\nmechanics might possess the advantages of instruction in the principles\non which their various occupations were conducted.  Among the committee\nwere Leonard Horner, Francis Jeffrey, Henry Cockburn, John Murray of\nHenderland, Alexander Bryson, James Mline, John Miller, the Lord Provost,\nand various members of the Council.  Their efforts succeeded, and the\ninstitution was founded.  The classes were opened in 1821, in which\nyear I became a student.\n\nIn order to supply the students, who were chiefly young men of the\nworking class, with sound instruction in the various branches of\nscience, the lectures were delivered and the classes were superintended\nby men of established ability in their several departments.\nThis course was regularly pursued from its fundamental and elementary\nprinciples to the highest point of scientific instruction.\nThe consecutive lectures and examinations extended, as in the\nUniversity, from October to May in each year's session.  It was, in\nfact, our first technical college.  In these later days when so many of\nour so-called Mechanics' Institutes are merely cheap reading-clubs for\nthe middle classes, and the lectures are delivered for the most part\nmerely for a pleasant evening' s amusement, it seems to me that we have\ngreatly departed from the original design with which Mechanics'\nInstitutions were founded.\n\nAs the Edinburgh School of Arts was intended for the benefit of\nmechanics, the lectures and classes were held in the evening after the\nday's work was over.  The lectures on chemistry were given by Dr. Fyfe\n--an excellent man.  His clearness of style, his successful\nexperiments, and the careful and graphic method by which he carried his\nstudents from the first fundamental principles to the highest points of\nchemical science, attracted a crowded and attentive audience.  Not less\ninteresting were the lectures on Mechanical Philosophy, which in my\ntime were delivered by Dr. Lees and Mr.Buchanan.  The class of\nGeometry and Mathematics was equally well conducted, though the\nattendance was not so great.\n\nThe building which the directors had secured for the lecture-hall and\nclass-rooms of the institution was situated at the lower end of Niddry\nStreet, nearly under the great arch of the South Bridge.  It had been\nbuilt about a hundred years before, and was formerly used by an\nassociation of amateur musicians, who gave periodical concerts of vocal\nand instrumental music.  The orchestra was now converted into a noble\nlecture table, with accommodation for any amount of apparatus that\nmight be required for the purposes of illustration.  The seats were\narranged in the body of the hall in concentric segments, with the\nlecture table as their centre.  In an alcove fight opposite the\nlecturer might often be seen the directors of the institution--\nJeffrey, Horner, Murray, and others--who took every opportunity of\ndignifying by their presence this noble gathering of earnest and\nintelligent working men.\n\nA library of scientific books was soon added to the institution, by\npurchases or by gifts.  Such was the eagerness to have a chance of\ngetting the book you wanted that I remember standing on many occasions\nfor some time amidst a number of applicants awaiting the opening of the\ndoor on an evening library night.  It was as crowded as if I had been\nstanding at the gallery door of the theatre on a night when some\ndistinguished star from London was about to make his appearance.\nThere was the same eagerness to get a good place in the lecture-room,\nas near to the lecture table as possible, especially on the chemistry\nnights.\n\nI continued my regular attendance at this admirable institution from\n1821 to 1826.  I am glad to find that it still continues in active\noperation.  In November 1880 the number of students attending the\nEdinburgh School of Arts amounted to two thousand five hundred!  I have\nbeen led to this prolix account of the beginning of the institution by\nthe feeling that I owe a deep debt of gratitude to it, and because of\nthe instructive and intellectually enjoyable evenings which I spent\nthere, in fitting myself for entering upon the practical work of my\nlife.\n\nThe successful establishment of the Edinburgh School of Arts had a\nconsiderable effect throughout the country.  Similar institutions were\nestablished, lectures were delivered, and the necessary illustrations\nwere acquired--above all, the working models of the steam-engine.\nThere was quite a run upon me for supplying them.  My third working\nmodel was made to the order of Robert Bald, for the purpose of being\npresented to the Alloa Mechanics' Institute; the fourth was\nmanufactured for Mr. G. Buchanan, who lectured on mechanical subjects\nthroughout the country; and the fifth was supplied to a Mr. Offley, an\nEnglish gentleman who took a fancy for the model when he came to\npurchase some of my father's works.\n\nThe price I charged for my models was #10; and with the pecuniary\nresults I made over one-third to my father, as a sort of help to\nremunerate him for my \"keep,\" and with the rest I purchased tickets of\nadmission to certain classes in the University.  I attended the\nChemistry course under Dr. Hope; the Geometry and Mathematical course\nunder Professor Wallace; and the Natural Philosophy course under my\nvalued friend and patron Professor Leslie.  What with my attendance\nupon the classes, and my workshop and drawing occupations, my time did\nnot hang at all heavy on my hands.\n\nI got up early in the mornings to work at my father's lathe, and I sat\nup late at night to do the brass castings in my bedroom.  Some of this,\nhowever, I did during the day-time, when not attending the University\nclasses.  The way in which I converted my bedroom into a brass foundry\nwas as follows:  I took up the carpet so that there might be nothing\nbut the bare boards to be injured by the heat.  My furnace in the grate\nwas made of four plates of stout sheet-iron, lined with fire-brick,\ncorner to corner.  To get the requisite sharp draught I bricked up with\nsingle bricks the front of the fireplace, leaving a hole at the back of\nthe furnace for the short pipe just to fit into.  The fuel was\ngenerally gas coke and cinders saved from the kitchen.  The heat I\nraised was superb--a white heat, sufficient to melt in a crucible six\nor eight pounds of brass.\n\nThen I had a box of moulding sand, where the moulds were gently rammed\nin around the pattern previous to the casting.  But how did I get my\nbrass?  All the old brassworks in my father's workshop drawers and boxes\nwere laid under contribution.  This brass being for the most part soft\nand yellow, I made it extra hard by the addition of a due proportion of\ntin.  It was then capable of retaining a fine edge.  When I had\nexhausted the stock of old brass, I had to buy old copper, or new,\nin the form of ingot or tile copper, and when melted I added to it\none-eighth of its weight of pure tin, which yielded the strongest alloy\nof the two metals.  When cast into any required form this was a treat\nto work, so sound and close was the grain, and so durable in resisting\nwear and tear.  This is the true bronze or gun metal.\n\nWhen melted, the liquid brass was let into the openings, until the\nwhole of the moulds were filled.  After the metal cooled it was taken\nout; and when the room was sorted up no one could have known that my\nfoundry operations had been carried on in my bedroom.  My brass foundry\nwas right over my father's bedroom.  He had forbidden me to work late\nat night, as I did occasionally on the sly.  Sometimes when I ought to\nhave been asleep I was detected by the sound of the ramming in of the\nsand of the moulding boxes.  On such occasions my father let me know\nthat I was disobeying his orders by rapping on the ceiling of his\nbedroom with a slight wooden rod of ten feet that he kept for measuring\npurposes.  But I got over that difficulty by placing a bit of old\ncarpet under my moulding boxes as a non-conductor of sound, so that no\nramming could afterwards be heard. My dear mother also was afraid that\nI should damage my health by working so continuously.  She would come\ninto the workroom late in the evening, when I was working at the lathe\nor the vice, and say, \"Ye'll kill yerself, laddie, by working so hard\nand so late\".  Yet she took a great pride in seeing me so busy and so\nhappy.\n\nNearly the whole of my steam-engine models were made in my father's\nworkroom.  His foot-lathe and stove, together with my brass casting\narrangements in my bedroom, answered all my purposes in the way of\nmodel making.  But I had at times to avail myself of the smithy and\nfoundry that my kind and worthy friend, George Douglass, had\nestablished in the neighbourhood.  He had begun business as \"a jobbing\nsmith,\" but being a most intelligent and energetic workman, he shot\nahead and laid the foundations of a large trade in steam-engines.\nWhen I had any part of a job in hand that was beyond the capabilities\nof my father's lathe, or my bedroom casting apparatus, I immediately\nwent to Douglass's smithy, where every opportunity was afforded me for\ncarrying on my larger class of work.\n\nHis place was only about five minutes' walk from my father's house.\nI had the use of his large turning-lathe, which was much more suitable\nfor big or heavy work than the lathe at home.  When any considerable\nbit of steel or iron forging had to be done, a forge fire and anvil\nwere always placed at my service.  In making my flywheels for the\nsectional models of steam-engines I had a rather neat and handy way of\nconstructing them.  The boss of the wheel of brass was nicely bored;\nthe arm-holes were carefully drilled and taped, so as to allow the arms\nwhich I had turned to be screwed in and appear like neat columns of\nround wrought iron or steel screwed into the boss of the flywheel.\n\nIn return for the great kindness of George Douglass in allowing me to\nhave the use of his foundry, I resolved to present him with a specimen\nof my handiwork.  I desired to try my powers in making a more powerful\nsteam-engine than I had as yet attempted to construct, in order to\ndrive the large turning-lathe and the other tools and machinery of his\nsmall foundry.  I accordingly set to work and constructed a\ndirect-acting, high-pressure steam-engine, with a cylinder four inches\nin diameter.  I use the term direct acting, because I dispensed with\nthe beam and parallel motion, which was generally considered the\ncorrect mode of transferring the action of the piston to the crank.\n\nThe result of my labours was a very efficient steam-engine, which set\nall the lathes and mechanical tools in brisk activity of movement.\nIt had such an enlivening effect upon the workmen that George Douglass\nafterwards told me that the busy hum of the wheels, and the active,\nsmooth, rhythmic sound of the merry little engine had, through some\nsympathetic agency, so quickened the stroke of every hammer, chisel,\nand file in his workmen's hands, that it nearly doubled the output of\nwork for the same wages!\n\nThe sympathy of activity acting upon the workmen's hands cannot be\nbetter illustrated than by a story told me by my father.  A master\ntailor in a country town employed a number of workmen.  They had been\nto see some tragic melodrama performed by some players in a booth at\nthe fair.  A very slow, doleful, but catching air was played, which so\nlaid hold of the tailors' fancy that for some time after they were\nfound slowly whistling or humming the doleful ditty, the movement of\ntheir needles keeping time to it; the result was that the clothing that\nshould have been sent home on Saturday was not finished until the\nWednesday following.  The music had done it!  The master tailor, being\nsomething of a philosopher, sent his men to the play again; but he\narranged that they should be treated with lively merry airs.\nThe result was that the lively airs displaced the doleful ditty;\nand the tailors' needles again reverted to even more than their\naccustomed quickness.\n\nHowever true the story may be, it touches an important principle in\nregard to the stimulation of activity by the rapid movements or sounds\nof machinery, which influence every workman within their sight or\nhearing.  We all know the influence of a quick merry air, played by\nfife and drum, upon the step and marching of a regiment of soldiers.\nIt is the same with the quick movements of a steam-engine upon the\nactivity of workmen.\n\nI may add that my worthy friend, George Douglass, derived other\nadvantages from the construction of my steam-engine.  Being of an\nenterprising disposition he added another iron foundry to his smaller\nshops; he obtained many good engineering tools, and in course of time\nhe began to make steam-engines for agricultural purposes.  These were\nused in lieu of horse power for thrashing corn, and performing several\noperations that used to be done by hand labour in the farmyards.\nOrders came in rapidly, and before long the chimneys of Douglass's\nsteam-engines were as familiar in the country round Edinburgh as corn\nstacks.  All the large farms, especially in Midlothian and\nEast Lothian, were supplied with his steam-engines. The business of\nGeorge Douglass became very large; and in course of time he was enabled\nto retire with a considerable fortune.\n\nIn addition to the steam-engine which I presented to Douglass,\nI received an order to make another from a manufacturer of braiding.\nHis machines had before been driven by hand labour; but as his business\nextended, the manufacturer employed me to furnish him with all engine\nof two-horse power, which was duly constructed and set to work,\nand gave him the highest satisfaction.\n\n[Image]  James Nasmyth's Expansometer, 1826.\n\nI may here mention that one of my earliest attempts at original\ncontrivance was an Expansometer--an instrument for measuring in bulk\nall metals and solid substances.  The object to be experimented on was\nintroduced into a tube of brass, with as much water round it as to fill\nthe tube.  The apparatus was then plunged into a vessel of boiling\nwater, or heated to boiling point; when the total expansion of the bar\nwas measured by a graduated scale, as seen in the annexed engraving.\nBy this simple means the expansion of any material might be ascertained\nunder various increments of heat, say from 60deg to 2l2deg.\nIt was simply a thermometer, the mass marking its own expansion.\nDr. Brewster was so much pleased with the apparatus that he described\nit and figured it in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, of which he\nwas then editor.\n\n[Image]  The road steam-carriage.  By James Nasmyth.\n\nAbout the year 1827, when I was nineteen years old, the subject of\nsteam carriages to run upon common roads occupied considerable\nattention.  Several engineers and mechanical schemers had tried their\nhands, but as yet no substantial results had come of their attempts to\nsolve the problem.  Like others, I tried my hand.  Having made a small\nworking model of a steam-carriage, I exhibited it before the members of\nthe Scottish Society of Arts.  The performance of this active little\nmachine was so gratifying to the Society that they requested me to\nconstruct one of such power as to enable four or six persons to be\nconveyed along the ordinary roads.  The members of the Society, in\ntheir individual capacity, subscribed #60, which they placed in my\nhands as the means for carrying out their project.\n\nI accordingly set to work at once.  I had the heavy parts of the engine\nand carriage done at Anderson's foundry at Leith.  There was in\nAnderson's employment a most able general mechanic named Robert\nMaclaughlan, who had served his time at Carmichaels' of Dundee.\nAnderson possessed some excellent tools, which enabled me to proceed\nrapidly with the work.  Besides, he was most friendly, and took much\ndelight in being concerned in my enterprise.  This \"big job\" was\nexecuted in about four months.  The steam-carriage was completed and\nexhibited before the members of the Society of Arts.  Many successful\ntrials were made with it on the queensferry Road, near Edinburgh.\nThe runs were generally of four or five miles, with a load of eight\npassengers sitting on benches about three feet from the ground.\n\nThe experiments were continued for nearly three months, to the great\nsatisfaction of the members.  I may mention that in my steam-carriage\nI employed the waste steam to create a blast or draught by discharging\nit into the short chimney of the boiler at its lowest part, and found\nit most effective.  I was not at that time aware that George Stephenson\nand others had adopted the same method; but it was afterwards\ngratifying to me to find that I had been correct as regards the\nimportant uses of the steam blast in the chimney.  In fact, it is to\nthis use of the waste steam that we owe the practical success of the\nlocomotive-engine as a tractive power on railways, especially at high\nspeeds.\n\nThe Society of Arts did not attach any commercial value to my steam\nroad-carriage.  It was merely as a matter of experiment that they had\ninvited me to construct it.  When it proved successful they made me a\npresent of the entire apparatus.  As I was anxious to get on with my\nstudies, and to prepare for the work of practical engineering,\nI proceeded no further.  I broke up the steam-carriage and sold the two\nsmall high-pressure engines, provided with a compact and strong boiler,\nfor #67, a sum which more than defrayed all the expenses of the\nconstruction and working of the machine.\n\nI still continued to make investigations as to the powers and\ncapabilities of the steam-engine.  There were numerous breweries,\ndistilleries, and other establishments, near Edinburgh, where such\nengines were at work.  As they were made by different engineers, I was\ndesirous of seeing them and making sketches of them, especially when\nthere was any special peculiarity in their construction.  I found this\na most favourite and instructive occupation.  The engine tenters became\nvery friendly with me, and they we re always glad to see me interested\nin them and their engines.  They were especially delighted to see me\nmake \"drafts,\" as they called my sketches, of the engines under their\ncharge.\n\nMy father sometimes feared that my too close and zealous application to\nengineering work might have a bad effect upon my health.  My bedroom\nwork at brass casting, my foundry work at the making of steam-engines,\nand my studies at the University classes, were perhaps too much for a\nlad of my age, just when I was in the hobbledehoy state--between a\nboy and a man.  Whether his apprehensions were warranted or not, it did\nso happen that I was attacked with typhus fever in 1828, a disease that\nwas then prevalent in Edinburgh.  I had a narrow escape from its fatal\ninfluence.  But thanks to my good constitution, and to careful nursing,\nI succeeded in throwing off the fever, and after due time recovered my\nusual health and strength.\n\nIn the course of my inspection of the engines made by different makers,\nI was impressed with the superiority of those made by the Carmichaels\nof Dundee.  They were excellent both in design and in execution.\nI afterwards found that the Carmichaels were among the first of the\nScottish engine makers who gave due attention to the employment of\nimproved mechanical tools, with the object of producing accurate work\nwith greater ease, rapidity, and economy, than could possibly be\neffected by the hand labour of even the most skilful workmen.  I was\ntold that the cause of the excellence of the Carmichaels' work was not\nonly in the ability of the heads of the firm, but in their employment\nof the best engineers' tools.  Some of their leading men had worked at\nMaudslay's machine shop in London, the fame of which had already\nreached Dundee; and Maudslay's system of employing machine tools had\nbeen imported into the northern steam factory.\n\nI had on many occasions, when visiting the works where steam-engines\nwere employed, heard of the name and fame of Maudslay.  I was told that\nhis works were the very centre and climax of all that was excellent in\nmechanical workmanship.  These reports built up in my mind, at this\nearly period of my aspirations, an earnest and hopeful desire that\nI might some day get a sight of Maudslay's celebrated works in London.\nIn course of time it developed into a passion.  I will now proceed to\nshow how my inmost desires were satisfied.\n\n\nCHAPTER 7.  Henry Maudslay, London\n\nThe chief object of my ambition was now to be taken on at Henry\nMaudslay's works in London.  I had heard so much of his engineering\nwork, of his assortment of machine-making tools, and of the admirable\norganisation of his manufactory, that I longed to obtain employment\nthere.  I was willing to labour, in however humble a capacity, in that\nfar-famed workshop.\n\nI was aware that my father had not the means of paying the large\npremium required for placing me as an apprentice at Maudslay's works.\nI was also informed that Maudslay had ceased to take pupils.\nAfter experience, he found that the premium apprentices caused him much\nannoyance and irritation.  They came in \"gloves;\" their attendance was\nirregular; they spread a bad example amongst the regular apprentices\nand workmen; and on the whole they were found to be very disturbing\nelements in the work of the factory.\n\nIt therefore occurred to me that, by showing some specimens of my work\nand drawings, I might be able to satisfy Mr. Maudslay that I was not an\namateur, but a regular working engineer.  With this object I set to\nwork, and made with special care a most complete working model of a\nhigh-pressure engine.  The cylinder was 2 inches diameter, and the\nstroke 6 inches.  Every part of the engine, including the patterns,\nthe castings, the forgings, were the results of my own individual\nhandiwork.  I turned out this sample of my ability as an engineer\nworkman in such a style as even now I should be proud to own.\n\nIn like manner I executed several specimens of my ability as a\nmechanical draughtsman; for I knew that Maudslay would thoroughly\nunderstand my ability to work after a plan.  Mechanical drawing is the\nalphabet of the engineer.  Without this the workman is merely a \"hand.\"\nWith it he indicates the possession of \"a head\" I also made some\nsamples of my skill in hand-sketching of machines, and parts of\nmachines, in perspective--that is, as such objects really appear when\nset before us in their natural aspect.  I was the more desirous of\nexhibiting the ability which I possessed in mechanical draughtsmanship,\nas I knew it to be a somewhat rare and much-valued acquirement.\nIt was a branch of delineative art that my father had carefully taught me.\nThroughout my professional life I have found this art to be of the\nutmost practical value.\n\nHaving thus provided myself with such visible and tangible evidences\nof my capabilities as a young engineer, I carefully packed up my\nworking model and drawings, and prepared to start for London.\nOn the 19th of May 1829, accompanied by my father, I set sail by the\nLeith smack Edinburgh Castle, Captain Orr, master.  After a pleasant\nvoyage of four days we reached the mouth of the Thames.  We sailed up\nfrom the Nore on Saturday afternoon, lifted up, as it were, by the tide,\nfor it was almost a dead calm the whole way.\n\nThe sight of the banks of the famous river, with the Kent orchards in\nfull blossom, and the frequent passages of steamers with bands of music\nand their decks crowded with pleasure-seekers, together with the sight\nof numbers of noble merchant ships in the river, formed a most glorious\nand exciting scene.  It was also enhanced by the thought that I was\nnearing the great metropolis, around which so many bright but anxious\nhopes were centred, as the scene of my first important step into the\nanxious business of life, The tide, which had carried us up the river\nas far as Woolwich suddenly turned; and we remained there during the\nnight.  Early next morning the tide rose, and we sailed away again.\nIt was a bright mild morning.  The sun came \"dancing up the east\"\nas we floated past wharfs and woodyards and old houses on the banks,\npast wherries and coal boats and merchant ships on the river,\nuntil we reached our destination at the Irongate Wharf, near the\nTower of London.  I heard St. Paul's clock strike six just as we\nreached our mooring ground.\n\nCaptain Orr was kind enough to allow us to make the ship our hotel\nduring the Sunday, as it was by no means convenient for us to remove\nour luggage on that day.  My father took me ashore and we walked to\nRegent's Park.  One of my sisters, who was visiting a friend in London,\nwas residing in that neighbourhood.  My father so planned his route as\nto include many of the most remarkable streets and buildings and sights\nof London.  He pointed out the principal objects, and gave me much\ninformation about their origin and history.\n\nI was much struck with the beautiful freshness and luxuriant growth of\nthe trees and shrubs in the squares; for spring was then in its first\nbeauty.  The loveliness of Regent's Park surprised me.  The extent of\nthe space, the brilliancy of the fresh-leaved trees, and the handsome\nbuildings by which the park was surrounded, made it seem to me more\nsplendid than a picture from the Arabian Nights.  Under the happy\naspect of a brilliant May forenoon, this first long walk through\nLondon, with all its happy attendant circumstances, rendered it one of\nthe most vividly remembered incidents in my life.  After visiting my\nsister and giving her all the details of the last news from home, she\njoined us in our walk down to Westminster Abbey.  The first view of the\ninterior stands out in my memory as one of the most impressive sights I\never beheld.  I had before read, over and over again, the beautiful\ndescription of the Abbey given by Washington Irving in the Sketch Book,\none of the most masterly pieces of writing that I know of I now found\none of my day-dreams realised.\n\nWe next proceeded over Westminster Bridge to call upon my brother\nPatrick.  We found him surrounded by paintings from his beautiful\nsketches from Nature.  Some of them were more or less advanced in the\nform of exquisite pictures, which now hang on many walls, and will long\ncommemorate his artistic life.  We closed this ever memorable day by\ndining at a tavern at the Surrey end of Waterloo Bridge.  We sat at an\nupper window which commanded a long stretch of the river, and from\nwhich we could see the many remarkable buildings, from St. Paul's to\nWestminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, which lay on the other\nside of the Thames.\n\nOn the following day my father and I set out in search of lodgings,\nhotels being at that time beyond our economical method of living.\nWe succeeded in securing a tidy lodging at No.  14 Agues Place,\nWaterloo Road.  The locality had a special attraction for me, as it was\nnot far from that focus of interest--Maudslay's factory.  Our luggage\nwas removed from the ship to the lodgings, and my ponderous cases,\ncontaining the examples of my skill as an engineer workman,\nwere deposited in a carpenter's workshop close at hand.\n\nI was now anxious for the interview with Maudslay.  My father had been\nintroduced to him by a mutual friend some two or three years before,\nand that was enough.  On the morning of May the 26th we set out\ntogether, and reached his house in Westminster Road, Lambeth.\nIt adjoined his factory.  My father knocked at the door.  My own heart\nbeat fast.  Would he be at home?  Would he receive us?  Yes!  he was at\nhome; and we were invited to enter.\n\nMr. Maudslay received us in the most kind and frank manner.  After a\nlittle conversation my father explained the object of his visit.\n\"My son,\" he said, pointing to me, \"is very anxious to have the\nopportunity of acquiring a thorough practical knowledge of mechanical\nengineering, by serving as an apprentice in some such establishment as\nyours\" \"Well,\" replied Maudslay, \"I must frankly confess to you that my\nexperience of pupil apprentices has been so unsatisfactory that my\npartner and myself have determined to discontinue to receive them--no\nmatter at what premium.  This was a very painful blow to myself; for it\nseemed to put an end to my sanguine expectations.\n\nMr. Maudslay knew that my father was interested in all matters relating\nto mechanical engineering, and he courteously invited him to go round\nthe works.  Of course I accompanied them.  The sight of the workshops\nastonished me.  They excelled all that I had anticipated. The beautiful\nmachine tools, the silent smooth whirl of the machinery, the active\nmovements of the men, the excellent quality of the work in progress,\nand the admirable order and management that pervaded the whole\nestablishment, rendered me more tremblingly anxious than ever to obtain\nsome employment there, in however humble a capacity.\n\nMr. Maudslay observed the earnest interest which I and my father took\nin everything going on, and explained the movements of the machinery\nand the rationale of the proceedings in the most lively and kindly\nmanner.  It was while we were passing from one part of the factory to\nanother that I observed the beautiful steam-engine which gave motion to\nthe tools and machinery of the workshops.  The man who attended it was\nengaged in cleaning out the ashes from under the boiler furnace,\nin order to wheel them away to their place outside.  On the spur of the\nmoment I said to Mr. Maudslay, \"If you would only permit me to do such\na job as that in your service, I should consider myself most fortunate!\"\nI shall never forget the keen but kindly look that he gave me.  \"So ,\"\nsaid he, \"you are one of that sort, are you?\" I was inwardly delighted\nat his words.\n\nWhen our round of the works was concluded, I ventured to say to\nMr. Maudslay that \"I had brought up with me from Edinburgh some\nworking models of steam-engines and mechanical drawings, and I should\nfeel truly obliged if he would allow me to show them to him?\"\n\"By all means,\" said he; \"bring them to me tomorrow at twelve o'clock.\"\nI need not say how much pleased I was at this permission to exhibit my\nhandiwork, and how anxious I felt as to the result of Mr. Maudslay's\ninspection of it.\n\nI carefully unpacked my working model of the steam-engine at the\ncarpenter's shop, and had it conveyed, together with my drawings,\non a hand-cart to Mr. Maudslay's next morning at the appointed hour.\nI was allowed to place my work for his inspection in a room next his\noffice and counting-house.  I then called at his residence close by,\nwhere he kindly received me in his library.  He asked me to wait until\nhe and his partner, Joshua Field, had inspected my handiwork.\n\nI waited anxiously.  Twenty long minutes passed.  At last he entered\nthe room, and from a lively expression in his countenance I observed in\na moment that the great object of my long cherished ambition had been\nattained!  He expressed, in good round terms, his satisfaction at my\npractical ability as a workman engineer and mechanical draughtsman.\nThen, opening the door which led from his library into his beautiful\nprivate workshop, he said, \"This is where I wish you to work, beside\nme, as my assistant workman.  From what I have seen there is no need of\nan apprenticeship in your case.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to show me the collection of exquisite tools of all\nsorts with which his private workshop was stored.  They mostly bore the\nimpress of his own clearheadedness and common-sense.  They were very\nsimple, and quite free from mere traditional forms and arrangements.\nAt the same time they were perfect for the special purposes for which\nthey had been designed.  The workshop was surrounded with cabinets and\ndrawers, filled with evidences of the master's skill and industry.\nEvery tool had a purpose.  It had been invented for some special\nreason.  Sometimes it struck the keynote, as it were, to many of the\nimportant contrivances which enable man to obtain a complete mastery\nover materials.\n\nThere were also hung upon the walls, or placed upon shelves, many\ntreasured relics of the first embodiments of his constructive genius.\nThere were many models explaining, step by step, the gradual progress\nof his teeming inventions and contrivances.  The workshop was thus\nquite a historical museum of mechanism.  It exhibited his\ncharacteristic qualities in construction.  I afterwards found out that\nmany of the contrivances preserved in his private workshop were\ntreasured as suggestive of some interesting early passage in his useful\nand active life.  They were kept as relics of his progress towards\nmechanical perfection.  When he brought them out from time to time,\nto serve for the execution of some job in hand, he was sure to dilate\nupon the occasion that led to their production, as well as upon the\nhappy results which had followed their general employment in mechanical\nengineering.\n\nIt was one of his favourite maxims, \"First, get a clear notion of what\nyou desire to accomplish, and then in all probability you will succeed\nin doing it.\"  Another was \"Keep a sharp look-out upon your materials;\nget rid of every pound of material you can do without; put to yourself\nthe question, 'What business has it to be there? avoid complexities,\nand make everything as simple as possible.\"  Mr. Maudslay was full of\nquaint maxims and remarks, the result of much shrewdness, keen\nobservation, and great experience.  They were well worthy of being\nstored up in the mind, like a set of proverbs, full of the life and\nexperience of men.  His thoughts became compressed into pithy\nexpressions exhibiting his force of character and intellect.\nHis quaint remarks on my first visit to his workshop, and on subsequent\noccasions, proved to me invaluable guides to \"right thinking\" in regard\nto all matters connected with mechanical structure.\n\nMr. Maudslay seemed at once to take me into his confidence.  He treated\nme in the most kindly manner--not as a workman or an apprentice,\nbut as a friend.  I was an anxious listener to everything that he said;\nand it gave him pleasure to observe that I understood and valued his\nconversation.  The greatest treat of all was in store for me.\nHe showed me his exquisite collection of taps and dies and screw-tackle,\nwhich he had made with the utmost care for his own service.\nThey rested in a succession of drawers near to the bench where he worked.\nThere was a place for every one, and every one was in its place.\nThere was a look of tidiness about the collection which was very\ncharacteristic of the man.  Order was one of the rules which he\nrigidly observed, and he endeavoured to enforce it upon all who were in\nhis employment.\n\nHe proceeded to dilate upon the importance of the uniformity of screws.\nSome may call it an improvement, but it might almost be called a\nrevolution in mechanical engineering which Mr. Maudslay introduced.\nBefore his time no system had been followed in proportioning the number\nof threads of screws to their diameter. Every bolt and nut was thus a\nspeciality in itself, and neither possessed nor admitted of any\ncommunity with its neighbours.  To such an extent had this practice\nbeen carried that all bolts and their corresponding nuts had to be\nspecially marked as belonging to each other.  Any intermixture that\noccurred between them led to endless trouble and expense, as well as\ninefficiency and confusion,--especially when parts of complex\nmachines had to be taken to pieces for repairs.\n\nNone but those who lived in the comparatively early days of machine\nmanufacture can form an adequate idea of the annoyance, delay, and cost\nof this utter want of system, or can appreciate the vast services\nrendered to mechanical engineering by Mr. Maudslay, who was the first\nto introduce the practical measures necessary for its remedy.  In his\nsystem of screw-cutting machinery, and in his taps and dies, and\nscrew-tackle generally, he set the example, and in fact laid the\nfoundation, of all that has since been done in this most essential\nbranch of machine construction.  Those who have had the good fortune to\nwork under him, and have experienced the benefits of his practice, have\neagerly and ably followed him; and thus his admirable system has become\nestablished throughout the entire mechanical world.\n\nMr. Maudslay kept me with him for about three hours, initiating me into\nhis system.  It was with the greatest delight that I listened to his\nwise instruction.  The sight of his excellent tools, which he showed me\none by one, filled me with an almost painful feeling of earnest hope\nthat I might be able in any degree to practically express how thankful\nI was to be admitted to so invaluable a privilege as to be in close\ncommunication with this great master in all that was most perfect in\npractical mechanics.\n\nWhen he concluded his exposition, he told me in the most kindly manner\nthat it would be well for me to take advantage of my father's presence\nin London to obtain some general knowledge of the metropolis, to see\nthe most remarkable buildings, and to obtain an introduction to some of\nmy father's friends.  He gave me a week for this purpose, and said he\nshould be glad to see me at his workshop on the following Monday week.\n\nIt singularly happened that on the first day my father went out with\nme, he encountered an old friend.  He had first known him at\nMr. Miller's of Dalswinton, when the first steamboat was tried, and\nafterwards at Edinburgh while he was walking the courts as an advocate,\nor writing articles for the Edinburgh Review.  This was no other than\nHenry Brougham.  He was descending the steps leading into St. James's\nPark, from the place where the Duke of York's monument now stands.\nBrougham immediately recognised my father.  There was a hearty shaking\nof hands, and many inquiries on either side.  \"And what brings you to\nLondon now?\" asked Brougham.  My father told him that it was about his\nson here, who had obtained an important position at Maudslay's the\nengineer.\n\n\"If I can do anything for you,\" said Brougham, addressing me, \"let me\nknow.  It will afford me much pleasure to give you introductions to men\nof science in London.\"  I ventured to say that \"Of all the men of\nscience in London that I most wished to see, was Mr. Faraday of the\nRoyal Institution.\"  \" Well,\" said Brougham, \"I will send you a letter\nof introduction.  We then parted.\n\nMy father availed himself of the opportunity of introducing me to\nseveral of his brother artists.  We first went to the house of\nDavid Wilkie, in Church Street, Kensington.  We found him at home,\nand he received us most kindly.  We next visited Clarkson Stanfield,\nDavid Roberts, and some other artists.  They were much attached to\nmy father, and had, in the early part of their career, received much\nkindness from him while living in Edinburgh.  They all expressed the\ndesire that I should visit them frequently.  I had thus the privilege\nof entree to a number of pleasant and happy homes, and my visits to\nthem while in London was one of my principal sources of enjoyment.\n\nOn returning home to our lodgings that evening we found a note from\nBrougham, enclosing letters of introduction to Faraday and other\nscientific men; and stating that if at any time he could be of service\nto me he hoped that I would at once make use of him.  My father was\ntruly gratified with the substantial evidence of Brougham's kindly\nremembrance of him; and I? how could I be grateful enough? not only for\nmy father's never-failing attention to my growth in knowledge and\nwisdom, but to his ever-willing readiness to help me onward in the path\nof scientific working and mechanical engineering. And now I was\nfortunate in another respect, in being admitted to the school,\nand I may say the friendship, of the admirable Henry Maudslay.\nEverything now depended upon myself, and whether I was worthy of all\nthese advantages or not.\n\nOne of the days of this most interesting and memorable week was devoted\nto accompanying Mr. Maudslay in a visit to Somerset House.  In the\nAdmiralty Museum, then occupying a portion of the building, was a\ncomplete set of the working models of the celebrated block-making\nmachinery.  Most of these were the result of Maudslay's own skilful\nhandiwork.  He also designed, for the most part, this wonderful and\ncomplete series of machines.  Sir Samuel Bentham and Mr. Brunel had\ngiven the idea, and Maudslay realised it in all its mechanical details.\nThese working models contained the prototypes of nearly all the modern\nengineer tools which have given us so complete mastery over materials,\nand done so much for the age we live in.\n\nIt added no little to the enjoyment of this visit to hear Mr. Maudslay\nnarrate, in his quaint and graphic language, the difficulties he had to\nencounter in solving so many mechanical problems.  It occupied him\nnearly six years to design and complete these working models.\nThey were forty-four in number--all masterly pieces of workmanship.\nTo describe them was to him like living over again the most interesting\nand eventful part of his life.  And no doubt the experience which he\nhad thus obtained formed the foundation of his engineering fortunes.\n\nMr. Maudslay next conducted us to the Royal Mint on Tower Hill.\nHere we saw many of his admirable machines at work.  He had a happy\nknack, in his contrivances and inventions, of making \"short cuts\" to\nthe object in view.  He avoided complexities, did away with roundabout\nprocesses, however ingenious, and went direct to his point.\n\"Simplicity\" was his maxim in every mechanical contrivance.\nHis mastermind enabled him to see through and attain the end he sought\nby the simplest possible means.  The reputation which he had acquired\nby his minting machinery enabled him to supply it in its improved form\nto the principal Governments of the world.\n\nSome of the other days of the week were occupied by my father in\nattending to his own professional affairs, more particularly in\nconnection with the Earl of Cassilis--whose noble mansion in London,\nand whose castle at Colzean, on the coast of Ayrshire, contain some of\nmy father's finest works.  The last day was most enjoyable.\nMr. Maudslay invited my father, my brother Patrick, and myself,\nto accompany him in his beautiful small steam yacht, the Endeavour,\nfrom Westminster to Richmond Bridge, and afterwards to dine with him at\nthe Star and Garter.  I must first, however, say something of the\norigin of the Endeavour.\n\nMr. Maudslay's son, Joseph, inherited much of his father's constructive\ngenius.  He had made a beautiful arrangement of William Murdoch's\noriginal invention of the vibrating cylinder steam-engine, and adapted\nit for the working of paddle-wheel steamers.  He first tried the action\nof the arrangement in a large working model, and its use was found to\nbe in every respect satisfactory.  Mr. Maudslay resolved to give his\nson's design a full-sized trial.  He had a combined pair of vibrating\nengines constructed, of upwards of 20 horse-power, which were placed in\na beautiful small steam vessel, appropriately named the Endeavour.\nThe result was perfectly successful.  The steamer became a universal\nfavourite.  It was used to convey passengers and pleasure parties from\nBlackfriars Bridge to Richmond.  Eventually it became the pioneer of a\nvast progeny of vessels propelled by similar engines, which still crowd\nthe Thames.  All these are the legitimate descendants of the bright and\nactive little Endeavour.\n\nTo return to my trip to Richmond.  We got on board the boat on the\nforenoon of May the 29th.  It was one of the most beautiful days of the\nyear.  The spring was at its loveliest.  The bright fresh green of the\ntrees was delightful.  I shall never forget the pleasure with which I\nbeheld, for the first time, the beautiful banks of the Thames.\nThere was at that time a noble avenue of elm trees extending along the\nsouthern bank of the river, from Westminster Bridge to Lambeth Palace;\nwhile, on the northern side, many equally fine trees added picturesque\ngrace to the then Houses of Parliament, while behind them were seen the\ngreat roof of Westminster Hall and the noble towers of Westminster\nAbbey.  As we sped along we admired the ancient cedars, which gave\ndignity to the Bishop's grounds, on the one side, and the elms,\nlaburnums, and lilacs, then in full bloom, which partially shaded the\nquaint old mansions of Cheyne Row, on the other.  Alas! the march of\nimprovement and the inevitable extension of the metropolis is rapidly\ndestroying these vestiges of the olden time.\n\nThe beautiful views that came into sight, as we glided up the river,\nkept my father and my brother in a state of constant excitement.\nThere were so many truly picturesque and paintable objects.\nPatrick's deft pencil was constantly at work, taking graphic notes of\n\"glorious bits\" Dilapidated farm-buildings, old windmills, pollarded\nwillows, were rapidly noted, to be afterwards revisited and made\nimmortal by his brush.  There were also the fine mansions and cosy\nvillas, partially shrouded by glorious trees, with their bright velvety\nlawns sloping down towards the river; not forgetting the delicate\nstreams of thin blue smoke rising lazily through the trees in the\ntranquil summer air, and reminding one of the hospitable preparations\nthen in progress.\n\nWe landed at Richmond Bridge, and walked up past the quaint\nold-fashioned mansions which gave so distinct a character to Richmond\nat that time.  We then passed on to the celebrated Richmond Terrace,\nat the top of the hill, from which so glorious a view of the windings\nof the Thames is seen, with the luxuriant happy-looking landscape\naround.  The enjoyment of this glorious day now reached its climax.\nWe dined in the great dining-room, from the large windows of which we\nobserved a view almost unmatched in the world, with the great tower of\nWindsor in the distance.  I need not speak of the entertainment, which\nwas everything that the kindest and most genial hospitality could\noffer.  After a pleasant stroll in the Park, amidst the noble and\nvenerable oak trees, which give such a dignity to the place, and after\nanother visit to the Terrace, where we saw the sun set in a blaze of\nglory beyond the distant scenery, we strolled down the hill to the\nsteamer, and descended the Thames in the cool of the summer evening.\n\nI must not, however, omit to mention the lodgings taken for me by my\nfather before he left London.  It was necessary that they should be\nnear Maudslay's works for the convenience of going and coming.\nWe therefore looked about in the neighbourhood of Waterloo Road.\nOne of the houses we visited was situated immediately behind the Surrey\ntheatre.  It seemed a very nice tidy house, and my father seemed to\nhave taken a liking for it.  But when we were introduced into the room\nwhere I was to sleep, he observed an ultra-gay bonnet lying on the bed,\nwith flashy bright ribbons hanging from it.  This sight seemed to alter\nhis ideas, and he did not take the lodgings; but took another where\nthere was no such bonnet.\n\nI have no doubt about what passed through his mind at the time.\nWe were in the neighbourhood of the theatre.  There was evidently some\ngay young woman about the house.  He thought the position might be\ndangerous for his son.  I afterwards asked him why we had not taken\nthat nice lodging.  \"Well,\" he said, \"did not you see that ultra-gay\nbonnet lying on the bed?  I think that looks rather suspicious!\"\nAfterwards he added, \"At all events, James, you will find that though\nthere are many dirty roads in life, if you use your judgment you may\nalways be able to find a clean crossing!\" And so the good man left me.\nAfter an affectionate parting he returned to Edinburgh, and I remained\nin London to work out the plan of my life.\n\n\nCHAPTER 8.  Maudslay's Private Assistant\n\nOn the morning of Monday, the 30th of May 1829, I commenced my regular\nattendance at Mr. Maudslay's workshop.  My first job was to assist him\nin making some modifications in the details of a machine which he had\ncontrived some years before for generating original screws.  I use the\nword \"generating\" as being most appropriate to express the objects and\nresults of one of Mr. Maudslay's most original inventions.\n\nIt consisted in the employment of a knife-edged hardened steel\ninstrument, so arranged as to be set at any required angle, and its\nedge caused to penetrate the surface of a cylindrical bar of soft steel\nor brass.  This bar being revolved under the incisive action of the\nangularly placed knife-edged instrument, it thus received a continuous\nspiral groove cut into its surface.  It was then in the condition of a\nrudimentary screw; the pitch, or interval between the threads, being\ndetermined by the greater or less angle of obliquity at which the\nknife-edged instrument was set with respect to the axis of the\ncylindrical bars revolving under its incisive action.\n\nThe spiral groove, thus generated, was deepened to the required extent\nby a suitable and pointed hard steel tool firmly held in the jaws of an\nadjustable slide made for the purpose, as part and parcel of the bed of\nthe machine.  In the case of square-threaded screws being required,\na square-pointed tool was employed in place of the V or angle-threaded\ntool.  And in order to generate or produce right hand or left hand\nscrews, all that was necessary was to set the knife-edged instrument to\na right or left hand inclination in respect to the axis of the\ncylindrical bar at the outset of the operation.\n\nThis beautiful and truly original contrivance became, in the hands of\nits inventor, the parent of a vast progeny of perfect screws, whose\ndescendants, whether legitimate or not, are to be found in every\nworkshop throughout the world, wherever first-class machinery is\nconstructed.  The production of perfect screws was one of Maudslay's\nhighest ambitions and his principal technical achievement.  It was a\ntype of his invaluable faculty of solving the most difficult problems\nby the most direct and simple methods.\n\nIt was by the same method that he produced the Guide screw.\nHis screw-cutting lathe was moved by combination wheels, and by its\nmeans he could, by the one Guide screw, obtain screws of every variety\nof pitch and diameter.  As an illustration of its complete accuracy\nI may mention that by its means a screw of five feet in length and two\ninches in diameter was cut with fifty threads to the inch; the Nut to\nfit on to it being twelve inches long, and containing six hundred\nthreads!  This screw was principally used for dividing scales for\nastronomical and other metrical purposes of the highest class.\nBy its means divisions were produced with such minuteness that they\ncould only be made visual by a microscope.\n\nThis screw was sent for exhibition to the Society of Arts.  It is still\npreserved with the utmost care at the Lambeth Works amongst the many\nadmirable specimens of Henry Maudslay's inventive genius and delicate\nhandiwork.  Every skilled mechanic must thoroughly enjoy the sight of\nit, especially when he knows that it was not produced by an exceptional\ntool, but by the machine that was daily employed in the ordinary work\nof the factory.\n\nI must not, however, omit to say that I took an early opportunity of\npresenting Brougham's letter of introduction to Faraday at the Royal\nInstitution.  I was received most cordially by that noble-minded man,\nwhose face beamed with goodness and kindness.  After some pleasant\nconversation he said he would call upon me at Maudslay's, whom he knew\nvery well.  Not long after Faraday called, and found me working beside\nMaudslay in his beautiful little workshop.  A vice had been fitted up\nfor me at the bench where he himself daily worked.  Faraday expressed\nhimself as delighted to find me in so enviable a position.\nHe congratulated me on my special good fortune in having the\ninestimable advantage of being associated as assistant workman with one\nof the greatest mechanical engineers of the day.\n\nMr. Maudslay offered to conduct Faraday through his workshops, and I\nwas permitted to accompany them.  I was much impressed with the\nintelligent conversation of Faraday, as well as with the quickness he\nexhibited in appreciating not only the general excellence of the design\nand execution of the works in progress, but his capacity for entering\ninto the technical details of the composite tools and machinery which\nhe saw during his progress through the place.  This most pleasant and\nmemorable meeting with the great philosopher initiated a friendship\nwhich I had the good fortune to continue until the close of his life.\n\nIt was, of course, an immense advantage for me to be so intimately\nassociated with Mr. Maudslay in carrying on his experimental work.\nI was not, however, his apprentice, but his assistant workman.\nIt was necessary, therefore, in his opinion, that I should receive some\nremuneration for my services.  Accordingly, at the conclusion of my\nfirst week in his service, he desired me to go to his chief cashier and\narrange with him for receiving whatever amount of weekly wages I might\nconsider satisfactory.  I went to the counting-house and had an\ninterview with Mr. Young the cashier, a most worthy man*\n [footnote...\nI may mention that he was brother to Dr. Thomas Young, the celebrated\nnatural philosopher.\n ...]\nKnowing as I did the great advantages of my situation, and having a\nvery modest notion of my own worthiness to occupy it, I said, in answer\nto Mr. Young's question as to the amount of wages I desired, that\n\"if he did not think ten shillings a week too much I could do well\nenough with that.\"  \"Very well\" said he,\"let it be so\" And he handed me\nover half a sovereign!\n\nI had determined, after I obtained a situation, not to cost my father\nanother shilling.  I knew how many calls he had upon him, at a time\nwhen he had his own numerous household to maintain.  I therefore\nresolved, now that I had begun life on my own resources, to maintain\nmyself, and to help him rather than be helped any longer.  Thus the\nfirst half-sovereign I received from Mr. Young was a great event in my\nlife.  It was the first wages, as such, that I had ever received.\nI well remember the high satisfaction I felt as I carried it home to my\nlodgings; and all the more so as I was quite certain that I could,\nby strict economy and good management, contrive to make this weekly sum\nof ten shillings meet all my current expenses.\n\nI had already saved the sum of #20, which I placed in the bank as a\ndeposit account.  It was the residue of the sale of some of my model\nsteam-engines at Edinburgh.  My readers will remember that I brought\nwith me a model steam-engine to show to Mr. Maudslay as a specimen of\nmy handiwork.  It had gained for me the situation that I desired, and I\nwas now willing to dispose of it.  I found a purchaser in Mr. Watkins,\noptician at Charing Cross, who supplied such apparatus to lecturers at\nMechanics' Institutions.  He gave me #35 for the model, and I added the\nsum to my deposit account.  This little fund was quite sufficient to\nmeet any expenses beyond those of a current weekly nature.\n\n[Image]  My cooking stove*\n [footnote...\nI have this handy apparatus by me still; and to prove its possession of\nits full original efficiency I recently set it in action after its rest\nof fifty years, and found that it yielded results quite equal to my\ngrateful remembrance of its past services.\n ...]\n\nBut I was resolved that my wages alone should maintain me in food and\nlodging.  I therefore directed my attention to economical living.\nI found that a moderate dinner at an eating-house would cost move than\nI could afford to spend.  In order to keep within my weekly income I\nbought the raw materials and cooked them in my own way and to my own\ntaste.  I set to and made a drawing of a very simple, compact, and\nhandy cooking apparatus.  I took the drawing to a tinsmith near at\nhand, and in two days I had it in full operation.  The apparatus cost\nten shillings, including the lamp.  As it contributed in no small\ndegree to enable me to carry out my resolution, and as it may serve as\na lesson to others who have an earnest desire to live economically,\nI think it may be useful to give a drawing and a description of my\ncooking stove.  The cooking or meat pan rested on the upper rim of the\nexternal cylindrical case, and was easily removable in order to be\nplaced handy for service.  The requisite heat was supplied by an oil\nlamp with three small single wicks, though I found that one wick was\nenough.  I put the meat in the pot, with the other comestibles,\nat nine o'clock in the morning.  It simmered away all day, until\nhalf-past six in the evening, when I came home with a healthy appetite\nto enjoy my dinner.  I well remember the first day that I set the\napparatus to work. I ran to my lodging, at about four P.M., to see how\nit was going on.  When I lifted the cover it was simmering beautifully,\nand such a savoury gusto came forth that I was almost tempted to fall\nto and discuss the contents.  But the time had not yet come, and I ran\nback to my work.\n\nThe meat I generally cooked in it was leg of beef, with sliced potato,\nbits of onion chopped down, and a modicum of white pepper and salt,\nWith just enough of water to cover \"the elements.\"  When stewed slowly\nthe meat became very tender; and the whole yielded a capital dish,\nsuch as a very Soyer might envy.  It was partaken of with a zest that,\nno doubt, was a very important element in its savouriness.  The whole\ncost of this capital dinner was about 4 1/2d. I sometimes varied the\nmeat with rice boiled with a few raisins and a pennyworth of milk.\nMy breakfast and tea, with bread, cost me about fourpence each.\nMy lodgings cost 3s. 6d. a week.  A little multiplication will\nsatisfy any one how it was that I contrived to live economically and\ncomfortably on my ten shillings a week.  In the following year my\nwages were raised to fifteen shillings a week, and then I began to take\nbutter to my bread.\n\nTo return to my employment under Mr. Maudslay.  One of the first jobs\nthat I undertook was in assisting him to make a beautiful small model\nof a pair of 200 horsepower marine steam-engines.  The engines were\nthen in course of construction in the factory.  They were considered a\nbold advance on the marine engines then in use, not only in regard to\ntheir great power, but in carrying out many specialities in their\ndetails and general structure.  Mr. Maudslay had embodied so much of\nhis thought in the design that he desired to have an exact model of\nthem placed in his library, so as to keep a visible record of his ideas\nconstantly before him.  In fact, these engines might be regarded as the\nculmination of his constructive abilities.\n\nIn preparing the model it was necessary that everything should be made\nin exact conformity with the original.  There were about three hundred\nminute bolts and nuts to be reduced to the proportional size.\nI esteemed it a great compliment to be entrusted with their execution.\nThey were all to be made of cast-steel, and the nuts had to be cut to\nexact hexagonal form.  Many of them had collars.  To produce them by\nthe use of the file in the ordinary mode would not only have been\ndifficult and tedious, but in some cases practically impossible.\n\n[Image]  Collar-nut cutting machine.\n\nTo get rid of the difficulty I suggested to Mr. Maudslay a contrivance\nof my own by means of which the most rigid exactness in size as well as\nform could be given to these hexagonal nuts.  He readily granted his\npermission.  I constructed a special apparatus, consisting of a hard\nsteel circular cutter to act as a circular file. When brought into\noperation in the production of these minute six-sided collared nuts,\nheld firm in the spindle of a small dividing plate and attached to the\nslide-rest, each side was brought in succession under the action of the\ncircular file or cutter with the most exact precision in regard to the\ndivision of the six sides.  The result was absolutely perfect as\nrespects the exactness of the six equal sides of the hexagonal nut, as\nwell as their precise position in regard to the collar that was of one\nsolid piece with it.  There was no great amount of ingenuity required\nin contriving this special tool, or in adapting it to the slide-rest of\nthe lathe, to whose spindle end the file or cutter /\\ was fixed.\nBut the result was so satisfactory, both as regards the accuracy and\nrapidity of execution in comparison with the usual process of hand\nfiling, that Mr. Maudslay was greatly pleased with the arrangement as\nwell as with my zeal in contriving and executing this clever little\ntool.  An enlarged edition of this collar-nut cutting machine was soon\nafter introduced into the factory.\n\n[Image]  Arrangement of the machine\n\nIt was one of the specialities that I adopted in my own workshop when I\ncommenced business for myself, and it was eagerly adopted by mechanical\nengineers, whom we abundantly supplied with this special machine.\nIt was an inestimable advantage to me to be so intimately associated\nwith this Great Mechanic.  He was so invariably kind, pleasant, and\ncongenial.  He communicated an infinite number of what he humorously\ncalled \"Wrinkles\" which afterwards proved of great use to me.\nMy working hours usually terminated at six in the evening.  But as many\nof the departments of the factory were often in full operation during\nbusy times until eight o'clock, I went through them to observe the work\nwhile in progress.  On these occasions I often met \"the guvnor, as the\nworkmen called Mr. Maudslay.  He was going his round of inspection,\nand when there was any special work in hand he would call me up to him\nto and explain point in connection with it that was worthy of\nparticular notice.  I found this valuable privilege most instructive,\nas I obtained from the cheif mechanic himself a full insight into the\nmethods, means, and processes by which the skilful workman advanced\nthe various classes of work.  I was also permitted to take notes and\nmake rapid sketches of any object that specially interested me.\nThe entire establishment thus became to me a school of practical\nengineering of the most instructive kind.\n\nMr. Maudslay took pleasure in showing me the right system and method of\ntreating all manner of materials employed in mechanical structures.\nHe showed how they might be made to obey your will, by changing them\ninto the desired forms with the least expenditure of time and labour.\nThis in fact is the true philosophy of construction. When clear ideas\nhave been acquired upon the subject, after careful observation and\npractice, the comparative ease and certainty with which complete\nmastery over the most obdurate materials is obtained, opens up the most\ndirect road to the attainment of commercial as well as of professional\nsuccess.\n\nTo be permitted to stand by and observe the systematic way in which\nMr. Maudslay would first mark or line out his work, and the masterly\nmanner in which he would deal with his materials, and cause them to\nassume the desired forms, was a treat beyond all expression.\nEvery stroke of the hammer, chisel, or file, told as an effective step\ntowards the intended result.  It was a never-to-be-forgotten practical\nlesson in workmanship, in the most exalted sense of the term.\nIn conformity with his often repeated maxim, \"that there is a right way\nand a wrong way of doing everything,\" he took the shortest and most\ndirect cuts to accomplish his objects.  He illustrated this by telling\nme, in his own humorous style, \" When you want to go from London to\nGreenwich, don't go round by Inverness.\"  Another of his droll sayings\nwas that he \"considered no man a thorough mechanic unless he could cut\na plank with a gimlet, and bore a hole with a saw!\"\n\nThe grand result of thoughtful practice is what we call experience:\nit is the power or faculty of seeing clearly before you begin, what to\navoid and what to select--or rather what to do and what not to do.\nHigh-class workmanship, or technical knowledge, was in his hands quite\na science.  Every piece of work was made subject to the soundest\nphilosophical principles, as applied to the use and treatment of\nmaterials.  It was this that gave such a charm of enjoyment to his\ndealing with tools and materials.  He loved this sort of work for its\nown sake, far more than for its pecuniary results.  At the same time he\nwas not without regard for the substantial evidence of his supremacy in\nall that regarded first-class tools, admirable management, and thorough\norganisation of his factory.\n\nThe innate love of truth and accuracy which distinguished Mr. Maudslay,\nled him to value highly that class of technical dexterity in\nengineering workmen which enabled them to produce those details of\nmechanical structures in which perfect flat or true plane surfaces were\nrequired.  This was an essential condition for the effective and\ndurable performance of their functions.  Sometimes this was effected\nby the aid of the turning-lathe and slide-rest.  But in most cases\nthe object was attained by the dexterous use of the file, so that\n\"flat filing\" then was, as it still is, one of the highest qualities\nof the skilled workman.  No one that I ever met with could go beyond\nHenry Maudslay himself in his dexterous use of the file.  By a few\nmasterly strokes he could produce plane surfaces so true that when\ntheir accuracy was tested by a standard plane surface of absolute\ntruth, they were never found defective; neither convex, nor concave,\nnor \"cross-winding,\"--that is, twisted.\n\nThe importance of having such Standard Planes caused him to have many\nof them placed on the benches beside his workmen, by means of which\nthey might at once conveniently test their work.  Three of each were\nmade at a time, so that by the mutual rubbing of each on each the\nprojecting surfaces were effaced.  When the surfaces approached very\nnear to the true plane, the still projecting minute points were\ncarefully reduced by hard steel scrapers, until at last the standard\nplane surface was secured.  When placed over each other they would\nfloat upon the thin stratum of air between them until dislodged by time\nand pressure.  When they adhered closely to each other, they could only\nbe separated by sliding each off each.  This art of producing\nabsolutely plane surfaces is, I believe, a very old mechanical \"dodge.\"\nBut, as employed by Maudslay's men, it greatly contributed to the\nimprovement of the work turned out.  It was used for the surfaces of\nslide valves, or wherever absolute true plane surfaces were essential\nto the attainment of the best results, not only in the machinery turned\nout, but in educating the taste of his men towards first-class\nworkmanship.\n\nMaudslay's love of accuracy also led him to distrust the verdicts given\nby the employment of the ordinary callipers and compasses in\ndetermining the absolute or relative dimensions of the refined\nmechanism which he delighted to construct with his own hands.\nSo much depended upon the manner in which the ordinary measuring\ninstruments were handled and applied that they sometimes failed to give\nthe required verdict as to accuracy.  In order, therefore, to get rid\nof all difficulties in this respect, he designed and constructed a very\ncompact and handy instrument which he always had on his bench beside\nhis vice.  He could thus, in a most accurate and rapid manner, obtain\nthe most reliable evidence as to the relative dimensions, in length,\nwidth, or diameter, of any work which he had in hand.  In consequence\nof the absolute truth of the verdicts of the instrument, he considered\nit as a Court of Final Appeal, and humorously called it\n\"The Lord Chancellor.\"\n\n[Image]  Maudslay's \"Lord Chancellor\"\n\nThis trustworthy \"Companion of the Bench\" consisted of a very\nsubstantial and inflexible bed or base of hard brass.  At one end of it\nwas a perfectly hardened steel surface plate, having an absolutely true\nflat or plane face, against which one end or side of the object to be\nmeasured was placed; whilst a similar absolutely true plane surface of\nhardened steel was advanced by means of a suitable fine thread screw,\nuntil the object to be measured was just delicately in contact with it.\nThe object was, as it were, between the jaws of a vice, but without any\nsqueeze--being just free, which could be easily ascertained by\nfeeling.  These two absolutely plane surfaces, between which the object\nlay, had their distances apart easily read off from the scale engraved\non the bed of the instrument, in inches and tenth parts of an inch,\nwhile the disk-head or handle of the screw was divided on its edge rim\ninto hundredth or thousandth parts, as these bore an exact metrical\nrelation to the pitch of the screw that moved the parallel steel faces\nof the measuring vice (as I may term it) nearer or farther apart.\n\nNot only absolute measure could be obtained by this means, but also the\namount of minute differences could be ascertained with a degree of\nexactness that went quite beyond all the requirements of engineering\nmechanism; such, for instance, as the thousandth part of an inch!\nIt might also have been divided so far as a millionth part of an inch,\nbut these infinitesimal fractions have really nothing to do with the\neffective machinery*\n [footnote...\nI may mention another saying of Mr. Maudslay's.  Besides his\nobservation that \"in going from London to Greenwich we must not go\nround by Inverness,\" he said, \"We must not become too complicated with\nour machinery.  Remember the get-at-ability of parts.  If we go on as\nsome mechanics are doing, we shall soon be boiling our eggs with a\nchronometer!\"\n ...]\nthat comes forth from our workshops, and merely show the mastery we\npossess over materials and mechanical forms.  The original of this\nmeasuring machine of Maudslay's was exhibited at the Loan Collection at\nSouth Kensington in 1878.  It is now treasured up, with other relics of\nhis handiwork, in a cabinet at the Lambeth works.  While writing upon\nthis subject it may be worthy of remark, that the employment of a screw\nas the means of adjusting the points or reference marks of a measuring\ninstrument, for the ascertainment of minute distances between objects,\nwas first effected by William Gascoigne, about the year 1648.\nThere can be no doubt that he was the inventor of the Micrometer--an\ninstrument that, when applied (as he first did so) to the eye-piece of\nthe Telescope, has been the means of advancing the science of astronomy\nto its present high position (See Grant's History of Astronomy, p. 453)\n\nI had abundant occupation for my leisure time after my regular\nattendance at the factory was over.  I had not only the opportunity of\nstudying mechanics, but of studying men.  It is a great thing to know\nthe character of those who are over you as well as those who are under\nyou.  It is also well to know the character of those who are associated\nwith you in your daily work.  I became intimate with the foremen and\nwith many of the skilled workmen.  From them I learnt a great deal.\nLet me first speak of the men of science who occasionally frequented\nMaudslay's private workshop.  They often came to consult him on\nsubjects with which he was specially acquainted.\n\nAmong Mr. Maudslay's most frequent visitors were General Sir Samuel\nBentham, Mr. Barton, director of the Royal Mint, Mr. Bryan Donkin,\nMr. Faraday, and Mr. Chantrey, the sculptor.  As Mr. Maudslay wished me\nto be at hand to give him any necessary assistance, I had the\nopportunity of listening to the conversation between him and these\ndistinguished visitors.  Sir Samuel Bentham called very often.\nHe had been associated with Maudslay during the contrivance and\nconstruction of the block machinery.  He was brother of the celebrated\nJeremy Bentham, and he applied the same clear common-sense to\nmechanical subjects which the other had done to legal, social,\nand political questions.  It was in the highest degree interesting and\ninstructive to hear these two great pioneers in the history and\napplication of mechanics discussing the events connected with the\nblock-making machinery.  In fact, Maudslay's connection with the\nsubject had led to the development of most of our modern engineering\ntools.  They may since have been somewhat altered in arrangement,\nbut not in principle.  Scarcely a week passed without a visit from the\nGeneral. He sat in the beautiful workshop, where he always seemed so\nhappy.  It was a great treat to hear him and Maudslay \"fight their\nbattles o'er again,\" in recounting the difficulties, both official and\nmechanical, over which they had so gloriously triumphed.\n\nAt the time when I listened to their conversation, the great work in\nhand was the organisation of a systematic series of experiments on the\nhulls of steamships, with the view of determining the laws of\nresistance on their being propelled through the sea by a power other\nthan those of winds and sails.  The subject was as complex as it was\ninteresting and important.  But it had to be put to the test of actual\nexperiment.  This was done in the first place by large models of hulls,\nso as to ascertain at what point the curves of least resistance could\nbe applied.  Their practical correctness was tested by careful\nexperiment in passing them through water at various velocities,\nto record which conditions special instruments were contrived and\nexecuted.  These, as well as the preparation of large models of hulls,\nembodying the various improved \"lines,\" occupied a considerable portion\nof the time that I had the good fortune to spend in Mr. Maudslay's\nprivate workshop.\n\nMr. Barton of the Royal Mint was quite a \"crony\" of Maudslay's.\nHe called upon him often with respect to the improvements for stamping\nthe current coin of the realm.  Bryan Donkin was also associated with\nMaudslay and Barton on the subject of the national standard of the yard\nmeasure.  But perhaps Mr. Chantrey was the most attractive visitor at\nthe private workshop.  He had many a long interview with Maudslay with\nrespect to the planning and arranging of a small foundry at his studio,\nby means of which he might cast his bronze statues under his own\nsuperintendence.  Mr. Maudslay entered con amore into the subject,\nand placed his skill and experience entirely at Chantrey's service.\nHe constructed the requisite furnaces, cranes, and other apparatus,\nat Chantrey's studio; and it may be enough to state that, when brought\ninto operation, they yielded the most satisfactory results.\n\nAmong my most intelligent private friends in London were George Cundell\nand his two brothers.  They resided near my lodgings, and I often\nvisited them on Saturday evenings.  They were most kind, gentle,\nand genial.  The eldest brother was in Sir William Forbes's bank.\nGeorge was agent for Mr. Patrick Maxwell Stuart in connection with his\nWest India estates, and the third brother was his assistant.\nThe elder brother was an admirable performer on the violoncello, and he\ntreated us during these Saturday evenings with noble music from\nBeethoven and Mozart.  My special friend George was known amongst us as\n\"the worthy master.\"  He was thoroughly versed in general science,\nand was moreover a keen politician.  He had the most happy faculty of\ntreating complex subjects, both in science and politics, in a\nthoroughly common-sense manner.  His two brothers had a fine feeling\nfor art, and, indeed, possessed no small skill as practical artists.\nWith companions such as these, gifted with a variety of tastes, I spent\nmany of my Saturday evenings most pleasantly and profitably. They were\ngenerally concluded with a glass of beer of \"the worthy master's\" own\nbrewing.\n\nWhen the season of the year and the state of the weather were suitable\nI often joined this happy fraternity in long and delightful Sunday\nwalks to various interesting places round London.  Our walks included\nWaltham Abbey, Waltham Cross, Eltham Palace, Hampton Court, Epping\nForest, and many other interesting places of resort.  When the weather\nwas unfavourable my principal resort was Westminster Abbey, where,\nbesides the beautifully-conducted service and the noble anthems,\nI could admire the glory of the architecture, and the venerable tombs,\nunder which lay the best and bravest.  I used generally to sit at a\npoint from which I could see the grand tomb of Aylmer de Vallance with\nits magnificent surroundings of quaint and glorious architecture.\nIt was solemn, and serious also, to think of the many generations who\nhad filled the abbey, and of the numbers of the dead who lay beneath\nour feet.\n\nI was so great an admirer of Norman and Gothic architecture that there\nwas scarcely a specimen of it in London which I did not frequently\nvisit.  One of the most interesting examples I found in the Norman\nportion of St. Saviours Church, near London Bridge, through some of\nit has since been destroyed by the so-called \"restoration\" in 1831.\nThe new work has been executed in the worst taste and feeling.\nI also greatly admired the Norman chapel of the Tower, and some Norman\nportions of the Church of St. Bartholomew the Less, near Smithfield.\n\nNo style of architecture that I have ever seen has so impressed me with\nits intrinsic gravity, and I may say solemnity, as that of the Norman.\nThere is a serious earnestness in its grave simplicity that has a\npeculiar influence upon the mind; and I have little doubt that this was\nfelt, and understood by those true architects who designed and built\nthe noble cathedrals at Durham and elsewhere.  But there, as elsewhere,\nsome of our modern so-called \"Architects\" have made sad havoc with the\nearliest and most impressive portions of those grand and truly\ninteresting remains, by their \"Restorations\", as they term it--but\nwhich I call Defamations.\n\n\nCHAPTER 9.  Holiday in the Manufacturing Districts.\n\nIn the autumn of 1830 Mr. Maudslay went to Berlin for the purpose of\nsuperintending the erection of machinery at the Royal Mint there.\nHe intended to be absent from London for about a month; and he kindly\npermitted me to take my holiday during that period.\n\nI had been greatly interested by the descriptions in the newspapers of\nthe locomotive competition at Rainhill, near Liverpool.  I was,\ntherefore, exceedingly anxious to see Stephenson's \"Rocket,\" the engine\nthat had won the prize.  Taking with me letters of introduction from\nMr. Maudslay to persons of influence at Liverpool, I left London for\nthe north on the afternoon of Saturday the 9th of September 1830.\nI took my place on the outside of the Liverpool coach, which set out\nfrom \"The Swan with Two Necks,\" in Lad Lane, City, one of the most\ncelebrated coach-offices in those days\n\nThe first part of the journey to Liverpool was very dismal.\nThe night was wet.  The rain came pouring down, and no sort of\nwrappings could keep it out.  The outside passengers became thoroughly\nsoaked.  On we went, however, as fast as four horses could carry us.\nNext morning we reached Coventry, when the clouds cleared away,\nand the sun at last burst forth.  I could now enjoy this charming part\nof old England. Although I had only a hasty glimpse in passing of the\nquaint streets and ancient buildings of the town I was perfectly\ndelighted with the specimens of ancient domestic architecture which\nI saw.  At that time Coventry was quite a museum of that interesting\nclass of buildings. The greater part of them have since been swept away\nin the so-called improvement of modern builders, none of whose works\ncan ever so attract an artistic eye.\n\nDuring the rest of the day the journey was delightful.  Though the\ninside passengers had had the best of it during the night, the outside\npassengers had the best of it now.  To go scampering across the country\non the top of the coach, passing old villages, gentlemen's parks, under\nold trees, along hedges tinged with autumn tints, up hill and down\ndale, sometimes getting off the coach to lighten the load, and walking\nalong through the fields by a short cut to meet it farther on; all this\nwas most enjoyable.  It gave me a new interest in the happier aspects\nof English scenery, and of rural and domestic life in the pretty\nold-fashioned farm buildings that we passed on our way.  Indeed, there\nwas everything to delight the eye of the lover of the picturesque\nduring the course of that bright autumnal day.\n\nThe coach reached Liverpool on Sunday night.  I took up my quarters at\na commercial inn in Dale Street, where I found every comfort which\nI desired at moderate charges.  Next morning, without loss of time,\nI made my way to the then terminus of the Liverpool and Manchester\nRailway; and there, for the first time, I saw the famous \"Rocket\"\nThe interest with which I beheld this distinguished and celebrated\nengine was much enhanced by seeing it make several short trial trips\nunder the personal management of George Stephenson, who acted as\nengineman, while his son Robert acted as stoker.  During their trips of\nfour or five miles along the line the \"Rocket\" attained the speed of\nthirty miles an hour--a speed then thought almost incredible!  It was\nto me a most memorable and interesting sight, especially to see the\nfather and son so appropriately engaged in working the engine that was\nto effect so great a change in the communications of the civilised\nworld.  I spent the entire day in watching the trial trips,\nin examining the railway works, and such portions of of their details\nas I could obtain access to.  About mid-day the \"Rocket\" was at rest\nfor about an hour near where I stood; and I eagerly availed myself of\nthe opportunity of making a careful sketch of the engine, which I still\npreserve.\n\nThe line was opened on the 15th of September, when the famous \"Rocket\"\nled the way in conducting the first train of passengers from Liverpool\nto Manchester.  There were present on that occasion thousands of\nspectators, many of whom had come from distant parts of the kingdom to\nwitness this greatest of all events in the history of railway locomotion.\n\nDuring my stay in Liverpool I visited the vast range of magnificent\ndocks which extend along the north bank of the Mersey, all of which\nwere crowded with noble merchant ships, some taking in cargoes of\nBritish manufactures, and others discharging immense stores of cotton,\nsugar, tobacco, and foreign produce.  The sight was most interesting,\nand gave me an impressive idea of the mighty functions of a\nmanufacturing nation--energy and intelligence, working through\nmachinery, increasing the value of raw materials and enabling them to\nbe transported for use to all parts of the civilised world.\n\nMr. Maudslay having given me a letter of introduction to his old friend\nWilliam Fawcett, head of the firm of Fawcett, Preston, and Company,\nengineers, I went over their factory.  They were engaged in producing\nsugar mills for the West Indies, and also in manufacturing the\nsteam-engines for working them.  The firm had acquired great reputation\nfor their workmanship; and their shops were crowded with excellent\nspecimens of their skill.  Everything was in good order;\ntheir assortment of machine tools was admirable.  Mr. Fawcett, who\naccompanied me, was full in his praises of my master, whom he regarded\nas the greatest pioneer in the substitution of the unerring accuracy of\nmachine tools for the often untrustworthy results of mere manual\nlabour.\n\nI cannot resist referring to the personal appearance and manner of this\nexcellent gentleman, William Fawcett.  His peculiar courteous manner,\nboth in speech and action, reminded me of the \"grand old Style\"\nWhich I had observed in some of my father's oldest noble employers,\nand the representations given of them by some of our best actors.\nThere was also a dignified kindliness about his manner that was quite\npeculiar to himself; and when he conducted me through his busy\nworkshops, the courtly yet kindly manner in which he addressed his\nvarious foremen and others, was especially cheering.  When I first\npresented my letter of introduction from Henry Maudslay, he was sitting\nat a beautiful inlaid escritoire table with his letters arrayed before\nhim in the most neat and perfect order.  The writing table stood on a\nsmall Turkey carpet apart from the clerks' desks in the room, but so\nnear to them that he could readily communicate with them.  His neat\nold-fashioned style of dress quite harmonised with his advanced age,\nand the kindly yet dignified grace of his manner left a lasting\nimpression on me as a most interesting specimen of \"the fine old\nEnglish gentleman, quite of the olden time.\"\n\nI spent another day in crossing the Mersey to Birkenhead--then a very\nsmall collection of buildings--wandered about the neighbourhood.\nI had my sketch-book with me, and made a drawing of Liverpool from the\nother side of the river.  Close to Birkenhead were some excellent bits\nof scenery, old and picturesque farmhouses, overshadowed with venerable\noaks, with juttings-out of the New Red Sandstone rocks, covered with\nheather, furze, and broom, with pools of water edged with all manner of\neffective water plants.  They formed capital subjects for the artistic\npencil, especially when distant peeps of the Welsh hills came into the\nprospect.  I made several sketches, and they kept company with my\ngraphic memoranda of architectural and mechanical objects.  I may here\nmention that on my return to London I showed them to my brother\nPatrick, and some of them so much met his fancy that he borrowed my\nsketch-book and painted some pictures from them, which at this day are\nhanging on the walls of some of his admirers.\n\nWith the desire of seeing as much as possible of all that was\ninteresting in the mechanical, architectural and picturesque line,\non my return journey to London, I determined to walk, halting here and\nthere by the way.  The season of the year and the state of the weather\nwere favourable for my purpose.  I accordingly commenced my pedestrian\ntour on Saturday morning, the 17th September.  I set out for Manchester.\nIt was a long but pleasant walk.  I well remember, when nearing\nManchester, that I sat down to rest for a time on Patricroft Bridge.\nI was attracted by the rural aspect of the country, and the antique\ncottages of the neighbourhood.  The Bridgewater Canal lay before me,\nand as I was told that it was the first mile of the waterway that the\ngreat Duke had made, it became quite classic ground in my eyes.\nI little thought at the time that I was so close to a piece of ground\nthat should afterwards become my own, and where I should for twenty\nyears carry on the most active and interesting business of my life.\n\nI reached Manchester at seven in the evening, and took up my quarters\nat the King's Arms Inn, Deansgate.  Next day was Sunday.  I attended\nservice in the Cathedral, then called the Old Church.  I was much\ninterested by the service, as well as by the architecture of the\nbuilding.  Some of the details were well worthy of attention, being\nvery original, and yet the whole was not of the best period of Gothic\narchitecture.  Some of the old buildings about the Cathedral were very\ninteresting.  They were of a most quaint character, yet bold and\neffective.  Much finely carved oak timber work was introduced into\nthem; and on the whole they gave a very striking illustration of the\nstyle of domestic architecture which prevailed in England some three or\nfour centuries ago.\n\nOn the following day I called upon Mr. Edward Tootal, of York Street.\nHe was a well-known man in Manchester.\n\nI had the happiness of meeting him in London a few months before.\nHe then kindly invited me to call upon him should I ever visit\nManchester, when he would endeavour to obtain for me sight of some of\nthe most remarkable manufacturing establishments.  Mr. Tootal was as\ngood as his word.  He received me most cordially, and at once proceeded\nto take me to the extensive machine factory of Messrs. Sharp, Roberts,\nand Co.  I found to my delight that a considerable portion of the\nestablishment was devoted to the production of machine tools,\na department of mechanical business then rising into the highest\nimportance.  Mr. Roberts, an admirable mechanic as well as inventor,\nhad derived many of his ideas on the subject while working with\nMr. Maudslay in London, and he had carried them out with many additions\nand improvements of his own contrivance.  Indeed, Roberts was one of\nthe most capable men of his time, and is entitled to be regarded as one\nof the true pioneers of modern mechanical mechanism.\n\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Tootal I had also the opportunity of\nvisiting and inspecting some of the most extensive cotton mills in\nManchester.  I was greatly pleased with the beautiful contrivances\ndisplayed in the machinery.  They were perfect examples of the highest\norder of ingenuity, combined with that kind of common-sense which casts\naside all mere traditional forms and arrangements of parts, such as do\nnot essentially contribute to the efficiency of the machine in the\nperformance of its special and required purpose.  I found much to\nadmire in the design as well as in the execution of the details of the\nmachines.\n\nThe arrangement and management of the manufactories were admirable.\nThe whole of the buildings, howsoever extensive and apparently\ncomplicated, worked like one grand and perfectly constructed machine.\n\nI was also much impressed by the keen interest which the proprietors of\nthese vast establishments took in the minute details of their\nmachinery, as well as by their intelligent and practical acquaintance\nwith the technical minutiae of their business.  Although many of them\nwere men of fortune, they continued to take as deep an interest in such\nmatters as if they were beginning life and had their fortunes still to\nmake.  Their chief ambition was to be at the head of a thoroughly\nwell-managed and prosperous establishment.  No detail, be it ever so\nsmall, was beneath their care and attention.  To a young man like\nmyself, then about to enter upon a similar career of industry, these\nlessons were very important.  They were encouraging examples of\ncarefully thought out designs, carried into admirable results by close\nattention to details, ever watchful carefulness, and indomitable\nperseverance.  I brooded over these circumstances, They filled my mind\nwith hope.  They encouraged me to go on in the path which I had\nselected; and I believed that at some time or other I might be enabled\nto imitate the examples of zeal and industry which I had witnessed\nduring my stay in Manchester.  It was then that I bethought me of\nsettling down in this busy neighbourhood; and as I plodded my way back\nto London this thought continually occupied me. It took root in my mind\nand grew, and at length the idea became a reality.\n\nI did not take the shortest route on my return journey to London.\nI desired to pass through the most interesting and picturesque places\nwithout unduly diverging from the right direction.  I wished to see the\nvenerable buildings and cathedrals of the olden time, as well as the\nengineering establishments of the new.  Notwithstanding my love for\nmechanics I still retained a spice of the antiquarian feeling.\nIt enabled me to look back to the remote past, into the material\nrecords of man's efforts hundreds of years ago, and contrast them with\nthe modern progress of arts and sciences.  I was especially interested\nin the architecture of bygone ages; but here, alas! arts and sciences\nhave done nothing.  Modern Gothic architecture is merely an imitation\nof the old, and often a very bad imitation.  Even ancient domestic\narchitecture is much superior to the modern.  We can now only imitate\nit; and often spoil when imitating.\n\nI left Manchester and turned my steps in the direction of Coalbrookdale.\nI passed through a highly picturesque country, in which I enjoyed the\nsight of many old timber houses, most attractive subjects for my pencil.\nMy route lay through Whitchurch, Wem, and Wellington; then past the\nWrekin to Coalbrookdale.  Before arriving there I saw the first iron\nbridge constructed in England, an object of historical interest in that\nclass of structures.  It was because of the superb quality of the\ncastings produced at Coalbrookdale that the ironmasters there were able\nto accomplish the building of a bridge of that material, which before\nhad baffled all projectors both at home and abroad\n\nI possessed a letter of introduction to the manager, and was received\nby him most cordially.  He permitted me to examine the works.\nI was greatly interested at the sight of the processes of casting.\nMany beautiful objects were turned out for architectural, domestic,\nand other purposes.  I saw nothing particularly novel, however, in the\nmethods and processes of moulding and casting.\n\nThe excellence of the work depended for the most part upon the great\ncare and skill exercised by the workmen of the foundry.  They seemed to\nvie with each other in turning out the best castings, and their models\nor patterns were made with the utmost care.  I was particularly\nimpressed with the cheerful zeal and activity of the workmen and\nforemen of this justly celebrated establishment.\n\nOn leaving Coalbrookdale I trudged my way towards Wolverhampton.\nI rested at Shiffnal for the night.  Next day I was in the middle of\nthe Black Country.  I had no letters of introduction to employers in\nWolverhampton; so that, without stopping there, I proceeded at once to\nDudley.  The Black Country is anything but picturesque.  The earth\nseems to have been turned inside out.  Its entrails are strewn about;\nnearly the entire surface of the ground is covered with cinder-heaps\nand mounds of scoriae.  The coal which has been drawn from below ground\nis blazing on the surface.  The district is crowded with iron furnaces,\npuddling furnaces, and coal-pit engine furnaces.  By day and by night\nthe country is glowing with fire, and the smoke of the ironworks hovers\nover it.  There is a rumbling and clanking of iron forges and rolling\nmills.  Workmen covered with smut, and with fierce white eyes, are seen\nmoving about amongst the glowing iron and the dull thud of forge-hammers.\nAmidst these flaming, smoky, clanging works, I beheld the remains of\nwhat had once been happy farmhouses, now ruined and deserted.\nThe ground underneath them had sunk by the working out of the coal,\nand they were falling to pieces.  They had in former times been\nsurrounded by clumps of trees; but only the skeletons of them remained,\ndead, black, and leafless.  The grass had been parched and killed by\nthe vapours of sulphurous acid thrown out by the chimneys; and every\nherbaceous object was of a ghastly gray--the emblem of vegetable\ndeath in its saddest aspect.  Vulcan had driven out Ceres.  In some\nplaces I heard a sort of chirruping sound, as of some forlorn bird\nhaunting the ruins of the old farmsteads.  But no! the chirrup was a\nvile delusion.  It proceeded from the shrill creaking of the\ncoal-winding chains, which were placed in small tunnels beneath the\nhedgeless road.\n\nI went into some of the forges to see the workmen at their labours.\nThere was no need of introduction; the works were open to all, for they\nwere unsurrounded by walls.  I saw the white-hot iron run out from the\nfurnace; I saw it spun, as it were, into bars and iron ribbands, with\nan ease and rapidity which seemed marvellous.  There were also the\nponderous hammers and clanking rolling-mills.  I wandered from one to\nanother without restraint.  I lingered among the blast furnaces, seeing\nthe flood of molten iron run out from time to time, and remained there\nuntil it was late.  When it became dark the scene was still more\nimpressive.  The workmen within seemed to be running about amidst the\nflames as in a pandemonium; while around and outside the horizon was a\nglowing belt of fire, making even the stars look pale and feeble.\nAt last I came away with reluctance, and made my way towards Dudley.\nI reached the town at a late hour.  I was exhausted in mind and body,\nyet the day had been most interesting and exciting.  A sound sleep\nrefreshed me, and I was up in the morning early, to recommence my\njourney of inquiry,\n\nI made my way to the impressive ruins of Dudley Castle, the remnant of\na very ancient stronghold, originally built by Dud, the Saxon.\nThe castle is situated on a finely wooded hill; it is so extensive that\nit more resembles the ruins of a town than of a single building.\nYou enter through a treble gateway, and see the remnants of the moat,\nthe court, and the keep.  Here are the central hall, the guard, rooms,\nand the chapel.  It must have been a magnificent structure.  In the\nMidlands it was known as the \"Castle of the Woods\" Now it is abandoned\nby its owners, and surrounded by the Black Country.  It is undermined\nby collieries, and even penetrated by a canal.  The castle walls\nsometimes tremble when a blast occurs in the bowels of the mountain\nbeneath.  The town of Dudley lies quite close to the castle, and was\ndoubtless protected by it in ancient times.\n\nThe architectural remains are of various degrees of antiquity, and are\nwell worthy of study, as embodying the successive periods which they\nrepresent.  Their melancholy grandeur is rendered all the more\nimpressive by the coal and iron works with which they are surrounded--\nthe olden type of buildings confronting the modern.  The venerable\ntrees struggle for existence under the destroying influence of\nsulphurous acid; while the grass is withered and the vegetation\neverywhere blighted.  I sat down on an elevated part of the ruins,\nand looked down upon the extensive district, with its roaring and\nblazing furnaces, the smoke of which blackened the country as far as\nthe eye could reach; and as I watched the decaying trees I thought of\nthe price we had to pay for our vaunted supremacy in the manufacture of\niron.  We may fill our purses, but we pay a heavy price for it in the\nloss of picturesqueness and beauty.  I left the castle with reluctance,\nand proceeded to inspect the limestone quarries in the neighbourhood.\nThe limestone has long been worked out from underneath the castle;\nbut not far from it is Wren's Nest Hill, a mountain of limestone.\nThe wrens have left, but the quarries are there.  The walk to the hill\nis along green lanes and over quiet fields.  I entered one of the\nquarries opened out in the sloping precipice, and penetrated as far as\nthe glimmer of sunlight enabled me to see my way.  But the sound of the\ndripping of water from the root of the cave warned me that I was\napproaching some deep pool, into which a false step might plunge me.\nI therefore kept within the light of day.  An occasional ray of the sun\nlit up the enormous rock pillars which the quarrymen had left to\nsupport the roof.  It was a most impressive sight.\n\nHaving emerged from the subterranean cave, I proceeded on my way to\nBirmingham.  I reached the town in the evening, and found most\ncomfortable quarters.  On the following day I visited some of the\nfactories where processes were carried on in connection with the\nBirmingham trade.  I saw the mills where sheet brass and copper were\nrolled for the purpose of being plated with silver.  There was nothing\nin these processes of novel interest, though I picked up many practical\nhints.  I could not fail to be attracted by the dexterous and rapid\nmanipulation of the work in hand, even by boys and girls whose quick\nsight and nimble fingers were educated to a high degree of perfection.\nI could have spent a month profitably among the vast variety of small\ntraders in metal, of which Birmingham is the headquarters.\nEven in what is called \"the toy trade,\" I found a vast amount of skill\ndisplayed in the production of goldsmith work, in earrings, brooches,\ngold chains, rings, beads, and glass eyes for stuffed birds, dolls, and\nmen.\n\nI was especially attracted by Soho, once the famous manufacturing\nestablishment of Boulton and Watt.  Although this was not the\nbirthplace*\n[footnote...\nThe birthplace of the condensing engine of Watt was the workshop in the\nGlasgow University, where he first contrived and used a separate\ncondenser--the true and vital element in Watt's invention.\nThe condenser afterwards attained its true effective manhood at Soho\nThe Newcomen engine was in fact a condensing engine, but as the\ncondensation was effected inside the steam cylinder it was a very\ncostly source of power in respect to steam.  Watt's happy idea of\ncondensing in a separate vessel removed the defect.  This was first\ndone in his experimental engine in the Glasgow University workshop,\nand before he had made the one at Kinniel for Dr. Roebuck.\n ...]\nof the condensing steam-engine it was the place where it attained its\nfull manhood of efficiency, and became the source and origin of English\nmanufacturing power.  Watt's engine has had a greater influence on the\nproductive arts of mankind than any other that can be named.  Boulton\nalso was a thorough man of business, without whom, perhaps, Watt could\nnever have made his way against the world, or perfected his magnificent\ninvention.  Not less interesting to my mind was the memory of that\nincomparable mechanic,  William Murdoch, a man of indomitable energy,\nand Watt's right-hand man in the highest practical sense.  Murdoch was\nthe inventor of the first model locomotive, and the inventor of gas for\nlighting purposes; and yet he always kept himself in the background,\nfor he was excessively modest. He was happiest when he could best\npromote the welfare of the great house of Boulton and Watt.  Indeed he\nwas a man whose memory ought to be held in the highest regard by all\ntrue engineers and mechanics.\n\nThe sight which I obtained of the vast series of workshops of this\ncelebrated establishment--filled with evidences of the mechanical\ngenius of these master minds--made me feel that I was indeed on\nclassic ground in regard to everything connected with steam-engine\nmachinery.  Some of the engines designed by Watt--the prototypes of\nthe powerful condensing engines of the present day--were still\nperforming their daily quota of work.  There was \"Old Bess,\"\na sort of experimental engine, upon which Watt had tried many\nadaptations and alterations, for the purpose of suiting it for pumping\nwater from coal mines.  There was also the engine with the\nsun-and-planet motion, an invention of William Murdoch's.\nBoth of these engines were still at work.\n\nI went through the workshops, where I was specially interested by\nseeing the action of the machine tools.  There I observed Murdoch's\nadmirable system of transmitting power from one central engine to other\nsmall vacuum engines attached to the individual machines they were set\nto work.  The power was communicated by pipes led from the central air\nor exhaust pump to small vacuum or atmospheric engines devoted to the\ndriving of each separate machine, thus doing away with all shafting and\nleather belts, the required speed being kept up or modified at pleasure\nwithout in any way interfering with the other machines. --This vacuum\nmethod of transmitting power dates from the time of Papin; but until it\nreceived the masterly touch of Murdoch it remained a dead contrivance\nfor more than a century.\n\nI concluded my visits to the workshops of Birmingham by calling upon a\nlittle known but very ingenious man, whose work I had seen before\nI left Edinburgh, in a beautifully constructed foot turning-lathe made\nby John Drain.  I was so much impressed with the exquisite design,\nexecution, and completeness of the lathe, that I made it one of my\nchief objects to find out John Drain's workshop.  It was with some\ndifficulty that I found him.  He was little known in Birmingham.\nHis workshops were very small; they consisted of only one or two rooms.\nHis exquisite lathes were not much in demand.  They found their way\nchiefly to distant parts of the country, where they were highly\nesteemed.\n\nI found that he had some exquisitely finished lathes completed and in\nhand for engraving the steel plates for printing bank notes.  They were\nprovided with the means of producing such intricate ornamental patterns\nas to defy the utmost skill of the forger.  Perkins had done a good\ndeal in the same way; but Drain's exquisite mechanism enabled his\nengraving lathes to surpass anything that had before been attempted in\nthe same line.  I believe that Drain's earnest attention to his work,\nin which he had little or no assistance, undermined his health,\nand arrested the career of one who, had he lived, would have attained\nthe highest position in his profession.  I shall never forget the rare\ntreat which his fine mechanism afforded me.  Its prominent quality was\nabsolute truth and accuracy in every part.\n\nHaving now had enough of the Black Country and of Birmingham workshops,\nI proceeded towards London.  There were no more manufacturing districts\nto be visited.  Everything now was to be green lanes, majestic trees,\nold mansions, venerable castles, and picturesque scenery.  There is no\nway of seeing a country properly except on foot.  By railway you whiz\npast and see nothing.  Even by coach the best parts of the scenery are\nunseen.  \"Shank's naig\" is the best of all methods, provided you have\ntime.  I had still some days to spare before the conclusion of my\nholiday.  I therefore desired to see some of the beautiful scenery and\nobjects of antiquarian interest before returning to work.\n\nI made my way across country to Kenilworth.  The weather was fine,\nand the walk was perfect.  The wayside was bordered by grassy sward.\nWide and irregular margins extended on each side of the road, and noble\ntrees and untrinnned hedges, in their glowing autumnal tint, extended\nfar and wide.  Everything was in the most gloriously neglected and\ntherefore highly picturesque condition.  Here and there old farmhouses\nand labourers' cottages peeped up from amidst the trees and hedges--\nworthy of the landscape painter's highest skill.\n\nI reached Kenilworth about half an hour before sunset.  I made my way\ndirect to the castle, glorious in its decay.  The fine mellow glow of\nthe setting sun lit up the grand and extensive ruins.  The massive\nNorman keep stood up with melancholy dignity, and attracted my\nattention more than any other part of the ruined building.  To me there\nis an impressiveness in the simple massive dignity of the Norman\ncastles and cathedrals, which no other buildings possess. There is an\nexpression of terrible earnestness about them.  The last look I had of\nthe Norman keep was grand.  The elevated part was richly tinted with\nthe last glow of the setting sun, while the outline of the buildings\nbeneath was shaded by a dark purply gray.  It was indeed a sight never\nto be forgotten.  I waited until the sun had descended beneath the\nhorizon, still leaving its glimmer of pink and crimson and gray,\nand then I betook me to the little inn in the village, where I obtained\ncomfortable quarters for the night.  I visited the ruins again in the\nmorning.  Although the glory of the previous evening had departed,\nI was much interested in observing the various styles of architecture\nadopted in different parts of the buildings--some old, some\ncomparatively new.  I found the older more grand and massive, and the\nnewer, of the sixteenth century, wanting in dignity of design, and the\nworkmanship very inferior.  The reign of Shoddy had already begun\nbefore Cromwell laid the castle in ruins.\n\nIn the course of the day I proceeded to Warwick.  I passed along the\nsame delightful grass-bordered roads, shaded by noble trees.  I reached\nthe grand old town, with its antique buildings and its noble castle--\nso famous in English history.  Leaving the place with reluctance,\nI left it late in the afternoon to trudge on to Oxford. But soon after\nI started the rain began to fall.  It was the first interruption to my\nwalking journey which I had encountered during my three weeks' absence\nfrom London.  As it appeared from the dark clouds overhead that a wet\nnight had set in, I took shelter in a wayside inn at a place called\nSteeple Aston.  My clothes were dripping wet; and after a glass of very\nhot rum and water I went to bed, and had a sound sleep.  Next morning\nit was fair and bright.  After a substantial homely breakfast I set out\nagain.  Nature was refreshed by the steady rain of the previous night,\nand the day was beautiful.  I reached Deddington and stayed there for\nthe night, and early next morning I set out for Oxford.\n\nI was greatly excited by the first sight I had of the crowd of towers\nand spires of that learned and illustrious city.  Nor were my\nexpectations at all disappointed by a nearer approach to the colleges\nof Oxford.  After a most interesting visit to the best of the\nbuildings, I took in a, fair idea of the admirable details of this\nnoble city, and left in the afternoon of next day.  I visited, on my\nway to Thame, the old church of Iffley.  I was attracted to it by the\nfine old Norman work it contains, which I found most quaint and\npicturesque.\n\nI slept at Thame for the night, and next day walked to Windsor.\nI arrived there at sunset, and had a fine view of the exterior of the\ncastle and the surrounding buildings.  I was, however, much\ndisappointed on examining the architectural details.  In sight of the\nnoble trees about the castle, and the magnificent prospect from the\nterrace, I saw much that tended to make up for the disgust I felt at\nthe way in which all that was so appropriate and characteristic in so\nhistoric a place as Windsor Castle should have been tampered with and\nrubbed out by the wretched conceit of the worst architects of our worst\narchitectural period.\n\nI left Windsor next morning, and walked direct for London.  My time was\nup, but not my money.  I had taken eight sovereigns on setting out from\nLondon to Liverpool by coach, and I brought one sovereign back with me.\nRather than break into it I walked all the way from Windsor to London\nwithout halting for refreshment my entire expenditure during my three\nweeks' journey was thus seven pounds.\n\nWhen I look back upon that tour, I feel that I was amply rewarded.\nIt was throughout delightful and instructive.  The remembrance of it is\nas clear in my mind now as if I had performed the journey last year\ninstead of fifty years ago.  There are thousands of details that pass\nbefore my mind's eye that would take a volume to enunerate.  I brought\nback a book full of sketches; for graphic memoranda are much better\nfitted than written words to bring up a host of pleasant recollections\nand associations.  I came back refreshed for work, and possessed by an\nanxious desire to press forward in the career of industry which I had\nset before me to accomplish.\n\n\nCHAPTER 10.   Begin Business at Manchester\n\nMr. Maudslay arrived from Berlin two days after my return to London.\nHe, too, had enjoyed his holiday.  During his stay in Berlin he had\nmade the friendship of the distinguished Humboldt.  Shenkel,\nthe architect, had been very kind to him, and presented him with a set\nof drawings and engravings of his great architectural works, which\nMr. Maudslay exhibited to me with much delight.  What he most admired\nin Shenkel was the great range of his talent in all matters of design,\nhis minute attention to detail, and his fine artistic feeling.\n\nSoon after Mr. Maudslay's return, a very interesting job was brought to\nhim, in which he took even more than his usual interest.  It was a\nmachine which his friend Mr. Barton, of the Royal Mint, had obtained\nfrom France.  It was intended to cut or engrave the steel dies used for\nstamping coin.  It was a remarkable and interesting specimen of\ninventive ingenuity.  It copied any object in relief which had been\ncast in plaster of Paris or brass from the artist's original wax model.\nThe minutest detail was transferred to soft steel dies with absolute\naccuracy.  This remarkable machine could copy and cut steel dies either\nin intaglio or in cameo of any size, and, in short, enabled the\nmechanic who managed it to transfer the most minute and characteristic\ntouches of the original model to the steel dies for any variety of size\nof coin.  Nevertheless, the execution of some of the details of the\nmachine were so defective, that after giving the most tempting proof of\nits capabilities at the Royal Mint, Mr. Barton found it absolutely\nnecessary to place it in Maudslay's hands, in order to have its details\nthoroughly overhauled, and made as mechanically perfect as its design\nand intention merited.\n\nThis interesting machine was accordingly brought to the private\nworkshop, and placed in the hands of the leading mechanic, whom I had\nthe pleasure of being associated with, James Sherriff, one of our most\nskilled workmen.  We were both put to our mettle.  It was a job quite\nto my taste, and being associated with so skilled a workman as\nSherriff, and in constant communication with Mr. Maudslay, I had every\nopportunity of bringing my best manipulative ability into action and\nuse while perfecting this beautiful machine.  It is sufficient to say\nthat by our united efforts, by the technical details suggested by\nMr. Maudslay and carried out by us, and by the practical trials made\nunder the superintendence of Mr. Wyon of the Mint, the apparatus was at\nlength made perfect and performed its duty to the satisfaction of every\none concerned.\n\nMr. Maudslay had next a pair of 200 horse-power marine engines put in\nhand.  His sons and partners were rather opposed to so expensive a\npiece of work being undertaken without an order.  At that time such a\npower as 200 horse nominal was scarcely thought of; and the Admiralty\nBoard were very cautious in ordering marine engines of any sort.\nNevertheless, the engines were proceeded with and perfected.\nThey formed a noble object in the great erecting shop.  They embodied\nin every detail all Mr. Maudslay's latest improvements.  In fact the\nwork was the sum total of the great master's inventions and adaptations\nin marine engines.  The Admiralty at last secured them for the purpose\nof being placed in a very fine vessel, the Dee, then in course of\nconstruction.  Mr. Maudslay was so much pleased with the result that\nhe had a very beautiful model made of the engines; and finding that\nI had some artistic skill as a draughtsman, he set me to work to make a\ncomplete perspective drawing of their great engines as they stood all\nperfect in the erecting-shop.  This was a work entirely to my taste.\nIn due time I completed a graphic portrait of these noble engines,\ntreated, I hope, in an artistic spirit.  Indeed, such a class of\ndrawing was rarely to be had from any engineering draughtsman.\nMere geometrical drawing could not give a proper idea, as a whole,\nof so grand a piece of mechanism.  It required something of the\nartistic spirit to fairly represent it.  At all events my performance\nwon the entire approval of my master.\n\nMr. Maudslay was a man of a wide range of mechanical abilities.\nHe was always ready to enter upon any new work requiring the exercise\nof special skill.  It did not matter whether it was machine tools,\nengraving dies, block machinery, or astronomical instruments.  While at\nBerlin he went to see the Royal Observatory.  He was naturally much\ninterested by the fine instruments there--the works of Repsoldt and\nHertz, the pioneers of improved astronomical workmanship.\nThe continental instrument makers were then far in advance of those of\nEngland.  Mr. Maudslay was greatly impressed with the sight of the fine\ninstruments in the Berlin Observatory.  He was permitted to observe\nsome of the most striking and remarkable of the heavenly bodies--\nJupiter, Saturn, and the Moon.  It was almost a new revelation to him;\nfor the subject was entirely novel.  To be able to make such\ninstruments seemed to him to be a glorious achievement of refined\nmechanism and manipulative skill.  He returned home full of the\nwonderful sights he had seen.  It was a constant source of pleasure to\nhim to dwell upon the splendour and magnificence of the heavenly bodies.\n\nHe became anxious to possess a powerful telescope of his own.\nHis principal difficulty was in procuring a lens of considerable\ndiameter, possessed of high perfection of defining power.  I suggested\nto him the employment of a reflecting telescope, by means of which the\ndifficulties connected with the employment of glass could be avoided.\nThis suggestion was based upon some knowledge I had acquired respecting\nthis department of refined mechanical art.  I knew that the elder\nHerschel had by this means vastly advanced our knowledge of the\nheavenly bodies, indeed to an extent far beyond what had been achieved\nby the most perfect of glass lens instruments.  Mr. Maudslay was\ninterested in the idea I suggested; and he requested me to show him\nwhat I knew of the art of compounding the alloy called speculum metal.\nHe wished to know how so brittle a material could be cast and ground\nand polished, and kept free from flaws or defects of every kind.\n\nI accordingly cast for him a speculum of 8 inches diameter.  I ground\nand polished it, and had it fitted up in a temporary manner to exhibit\nits optical capabilities, which were really of no mean order. But, as\nhis ambition was to have a grand and powerful instrument of not less\nthan 24 inches diameter, the preparation for such a speculum became a\nsubject to him of the highest interest.  He began to look out for a\nproper position for his projected observatory.  He made inquiry about a\nresidence at Norwood, where he thought his instrument might have fair\nplay.  It would there be free from the smoke and disturbing elements of\nsuch a place as Lambeth.   His mind was full of this idea when he was\ncalled away by the claims of affection to visit a dear old friend at\nBoulogne.  He remained there for more than a week, until assured of his\nfriend's convalescence.  But on his return voyage across the Channel he\ncaught a severe cold.  On reaching London he took to his bed and never\nleft it alive.  After three or four weeks' suffering he died on the\n14th of February 1831.\n\nIt was a very sad thing for me to lose my dear old master.  He was so\ngood and so kind to me in all ways.  He treated me like a friend and\ncompanion.  He was always generous, manly, and upright in his dealings\nwith everybody.  How his workmen loved him; how his friends lamented\nhim!  He directed, before his death, that he should be buried in\nWoolwich Churchyard, where a cast iron tomb, made to his own design,\nwas erected over his remains.  He had ever a warm heart for Woolwich,\nwhere he had been born and brought up.  He began his life as a mechanic\nthere, and worked his way steadily upwards until he reached the highest\npoint of his profession.  He often returned to Woolwich after he had\nleft it; sometimes to pay a share of his week's wages to his mother,\nwhile she lived; sometimes to revisit the scenery of his youth.\nHe liked the green common, with the soldiers about it; Shooter's Hill,\nwith its wide look-out over Kent and down the valley of the Thames;\nthe river busy with shipping; the Dockyard wharf, with the royal craft\nloading and unloading their armaments.  He liked the clangour of the\narsenal smithy, where he had first learned his art; and all the busy\nindustry of the place.  It was natural, therefore, that being so proud\nof his early connection with Woolwich he should wish his remains to be\nlaid there; and Woolwich, on its part, has equal reason to be proud of\nHenry Maudslay.\n\nAfter the death of my master I passed over to the service of his worthy\npartner, Joshua Field.  I had an equal pleasure in working under him.\nHis kindness in some degree mitigated the sad loss I had sustained by\nthe death of my lamented friend and employer.  The first work I had to\nperform for Mr. Field was to assist him in making the working drawings\nof a 200 horse-power condensing steam-engine, ordered by the Lambeth\nWaterworks Company.  The practical acquaintance which I had by this\ntime acquired of the mechanism of steam-engines enabled me to serve\nMr. Field in a satisfactory manner.  I drew out in full practical\ndetail the rough but excellent hand sketches with which he supplied me.\nThey were handed out for execution in the various parts of the factory;\nand I communicated with the foremen as to the details and workmanship.\n\nWhile I was occupied beside Mr. Field in making these working drawings,\nhe gave me many most valuable hints as to the designing of machinery in\ngeneral.  In after years I had many opportunities of making good use of\nthem.  One point he often impressed upon me.  It was, he said, most\nimportant to bear in mind the get-at-ability of parts--that is, when\nany part of a machine was out of repair, it was requisite to get at it\neasily without taking the machine to pieces.  This may appear a very\nsimple remark, but the neglect of such an arrangement occasions a vast\namount of trouble, delay, and expense.  None but those who have had to\ndo with the repair of worn-out or damaged parts of machinery can\nadequately value the importance of this subject.\n\nI found Mr. Field to be a most systematic man in all business affairs.\nI may specially name one of his arrangements which I was quick to take\nup and appreciate.  I carried it out with great advantage in my after\nlife.  It was, to record subjects of conversation by means of \"graphic\"\nmemoranda.  Almost daily, persons of note came to consult with him\nabout machinery.  On these occasions the consultations took place\neither with reference to proposed new work, or as to the progress of\norders then in hand.  Occasionally some novel scheme of applying power\nwas under discussion, or some new method of employing mechanism:\nOn ordinary occasions rough and rapid sketches are made on any stray\npieces of waste paper that were about, and after the conversation is\nover the papers are swept away into the waste basket and destroyed.\nAnd yet some of these rapid drawings involve matters of great interest\nand importance for after consultations.\n\nTo avoid such losses, Mr. Field had always placed upon his table a\n\"talking book\" or \"graphic diary.\"  When his visitors called and entered\ninto conversation with him about mechanical matters, he made rapid\nsketches on the successive pages of the book, and entered the brief\nparticulars and date of the conversation, together with the name and\naddress of the visitor.  So that a conversation, once begun, might\nagain be referred to, and, when the visitor called, the graphic\nmemoranda might be recalled without loss of time, and the consultation\nagain proceeded.  The pages of Mr. Field's \"talking books\" were in many\nways most interesting.  They contained data that, in future years,\nsupplied valuable evidence in respect to first suggestions of\nmechanical contrivances, and which sometimes were developed into very\nimportant results.  I may add that Mr. Field kept these \"talking books\"\non a shelf in front of his drawing table.  The back of each volume was\nmarked with the year to which the entries referred, and an index was\nappended to each.  A general index book was also placed at the end of\nthe goodly range of these graphic records of his professional life.\n\nThe completion of the working drawings of the Lambeth pumping engines\noccupied me until August 1831.  I had then arrived at my twenty-third\nyear.  I had no intention of proceeding further as an assistant or a\njourneyman.  I intended to begin business for my self.  Of course I\ncould only begin in a very small way.  I informed Mr. Field of my\nintention, and he was gratified with my decision.  Not only so; but he\nkindly permitted me to obtain castings of one of the best\nturning-lathes in the workshops.  I knew th at when I had fitted it up\nit would become the parent of a vast progeny of descendants--not only\nin the direct line, but in planing machines, screw-cutting lathes,\nand many other minor tools.\n\nAt the end of the month, after taking a grateful farewell of Mr. Field\nand his partners, I set sail for Leith with my stock of castings,\nand reached Edinburgh in due time.  In order to proceed with the\nconstruction of my machine tools, I rented a small piece of land at Old\nBroughton.  It was at the rear of my worthy friend George Douglass's\nsmall foundry, and was only about five minutes' walk from my father's\nhouse.  I erected a temporary workshop 24 feet long by 16 feet wide.\n\nI removed thither my father's foot-lathe, to which I had previously\nadded an excellent slide-rest of my own making.  I also added a\n\"slow motion,\" which enabled me to turn cast-iron and cast-steel\nportions of my great Maudslay lathe.  I soon had the latter complete\nand in action.  Its first child was a planing machine capable of\nexecuting surfaces in the most perfect style--of 3 feet long by\n1 foot 8 inches wide.  Armed with these two most important and\ngenerally useful tools, and by some special additions, such as boring\nmachines and drilling machines, I soon had a progeny of legitimate\ndescendants crowded about my little workshop, so that I often did not\nknow which way to turn.\n\n[Image]  My temporary workshop at Edinburgh\n\nI had one labourer to drive the wheel which gave motion to my big\nlathe; but I was very much in want of some one else to help me.\nOne day a young hearty fellow called upon me.  He had come from the\nShotts Iron Company's Works in Edinburgh.  Having heard of what I was\nabout, he offered his services.  When he told me that he had been bred\nas a millwright, and that he could handle the plane and the saw as well\nas the chisel and the file, I closed with him at once.  He was to have\nfifteen shillings a week.  I liked the young man very much--he was so\nhearty and cheerful.  His name was Archibald Torry, or \" Archie,\" as he\nwas generally called during the twenty years that he remained in my\nservice I obtained another assistant in the person of a young man whose\nfather wished him to get an insight into practical engineering.  I was\noffered a premium of #50 for twelve months' experience in my workshop.\nI arranged to take the young man, and to initiate him in the general\nprinciples and practice of engineering. The #50 premium was a very\nuseful help to me, especially as I had engaged the millwright.\nIt enabled me to pay Torry's wages during the time that he remained\nwith me in Edinburgh.  I found it necessary, however, to take in some\nwork in the regular way of business, in order to supply me with the\nmeans of completing my proper supply of tools.\n\nThe chief of these extraneous and, I may say, disturbing jobs, was that\nof constructing a rotary steam-engine.  Mr. Robert Steen had contrived\nand patented an engine of this sort.  He was a dangerously enthusiastic\nman, and entertained the most visionary ideas as to steam power.\nHe was of opinion that his own contrivance was more compact and simple,\nand possessed of more capability of producing power from the\nconsumption of a given quantity of fuel, than the best steam-engines\nthen in use.  I warned him of his error; but nothing but an actual\nproof would satisfy him.  He urgently requested me to execute his\norder.He made me a liberal and tempting offer of weekly payments for my\nwork during the progress of his engine.  He only required that I should\ngive his invention the benefit of my careful workmanship.\nHe considered that this would be sufficient to substantiate all his\nenthusiastic expectations.  I was thus seduced to accept his order.\n\nI made the requisite drawings, and proceeded with the work.  At the\nsame time my own machine tools were in progress, though at a retarded\npace.  The weekly payments we're regularly made, and I was kept in a\nsort of financial ease.  After three months the rotary engine was\nfinished to the inventor's complete satisfaction.  But when the power\nit gave out was compared with that of a good ordinary steam-engine,\nthe verdict as to consumption of fuel was against the new rotary\nengine.  Nevertheless, the enthusiastic projector, \"tho' vanquished he\nwould argue still,\" insisted that the merits of his contrivance would\nsooner or later cause it to be a most formidable rival to the crank\nsteam-engines.  As he was pleased with its performances, I had no\nreason to be dissatisfied.  I had done my part in the matter, and\nMr. Steen had done his.  His punctual weekly payments had assisted me\nin the completion of my tools; and after a few months more labour I had\neverything ready for starting business on my own account.\n\nMy choice lay between Liverpool and Manchester.  I had seen both of\nthese cities while on my visit to Lancashire to witness the opening of\nthe Liverpool and Manchester Railway.  I now proceeded to visit them\nagain.  I was fortified with valuable introductions to leading men in\nboth places.  I was received by them with great kindness and\nhospitality.  I have heard a great deal about the ingratitude and\nselfishness of the world.  It may have been my good fortune, but I have\nnever experienced either of those unfeeling conditions.  On the whole I\nhave found a great deal of unselfish kindness among my fellow-beings.\nThey have often turned out of their way to do me a service; and I can\nnever be too grateful for the unwearied kindness, civility, and\ngenerosity of the friends I met with during my stay in Lancashire.\n\nIt was a question which would be the best place to settle in--\nLiverpool or Manchester.  I had seen striking evidences of the natural\naptitude of Lancashire workmen for every sort of mechanical employment,\nand had observed their unsparing energy while at work.  I compared them\nwith the workmen whom I had seen in London, and found them superior.\nThey were men of greater energy of character; their minds were more\ncapacious; their ingenuity was more inventive.  I felt assured that in\neither Liverpool or Manchester--the centres of commercial and\nmanipulative energy--I could settle down with my limited capital and\ntools, and in course of time contrive to get on, helped by energy,\nself-reliance, and determination.  I also found that the demand for\nmachine-making tools was considerable, and that their production would\nsoon become an important department of business.  It might be carried\non with little expenditure of capital, as the risks were small and the\nreturns were quick.  I resolved to cultivate that moderate and safe\nclass of mechanical business, at all events at the outset.\n\nI first went to Liverpool.  I presented my letter of introduction to\nMr. Roscoe, head of the Mersey Steel and Iron Company.  He received me\nwith great kindness, and gave me much good advice.  I called upon\nEdward Berry, engineer, and also upon William Fawcett, who had received\nme with so much kindness on my former visit.  I cannot omit mentioning\nalso the friendly reception which I received from Dr. Sillar.\nHe had been a medical student at Edinburgh, and had during that time\nmet with some kindness from my father.  He expressed his remembrance of\nit with grateful effusion; and added his personal introduction, with\nthat of my letters, to some of the leading men in Liverpool.  I may\nmention that Dr. Sillar was the son of Burns's \"Brother Poet\" Davie,\nto whom the well-known \"Epistle\" was addressed.\n\nAmong the other well-known men to whom I was introduced at Liverpool\nwas John Cragg, an intelligent and enterprising ironfounder.  He was an\nextensive manufacturer of the large sugar-boiling pans used in the West\nIndies.  He had also given his attention to the introduction of iron\ninto buildings of different sorts.  Being a man of artistic taste he\nhad even introduced cast-iron into Gothic architecture.  In order to\nexhibit, in an impressive form, the uses of his favourite metal,\nhe erected at his own cost a very elegant church in the northern part\nof Liverpool.*\n [footnote...\nSo far as I can recollect, the name of the church was St. James's.\nIt exhibited a very early introduction of iron as an important element\nin architectural construction.  Iron was afterwards largely introduced\ninto mills, mill gearing, and buildings generally.\n ...]\n\nCast-iron was introduced, not only in the material parts of the\nstructure, but into the Gothic columns and Gothic tracery of the\nwindows, as well as into the lofty and elegant spire.  Iron was also\nemployed in the external ornamental details, where delicate yet\neffective decoration was desirable.  The famous architect,\nEdward Blore, was the designer of the church; and the whole details of\nthe building--of which cast-iron formed the principal material--\nwere executed to his entire satisfaction*\n [footnote...\nSo far as I can recollect, the name of the church was St. James's.\nIt exhibited a very early introduction of iron as an important element\nin architectural construction.  Iron was afterwards largely introduced\ninto mills, mill gearing, and buildings generally.\n ...]\n\nMy introduction to Mr. Cragg led to an acquaintance, and then to a\nfriendship.  When the ice was broken which was very soon--he told me\nthat he was desirous of retiring from the more active part of his\nbusiness.  Whether he liked my looks or not I do not know; but, quite\nunexpectedly, he made me a very tempting offer to enter his works as\nhis successor.  He had already amassed a fortune, and I might do the\nsame.  I could only thank him most sincerely for his kindness.\nBut, on carefully thinking the matter over, I declined the proposal.\nMy principal reason was, that the special nature of his foundry work\ndid not quite harmonise with my desire to follow the more strictly\nmechanical part of the iron business.  Besides, I thought I had a\nbrighter prospect of success before me; though I knew that I had many\ndifficulties to contend against.  Did I throw away my chances in\ndeclining the liberal proposal of Mr. Cragg?  The reader will be able\nto judge from the following pages.  But to the last*\n [footnote...\nMr. Cragg died in 1853, aged 84.\n ...]\nI continued a most friendly intercourse with my intended patron, while\nhe on his part took an almost paternal interest in my progress.\n\nAfter my visit to Liverpool I passed on to Manchester.\nI was fortunate in having introductions to some of the leading men\nthere,--to John Kennedy, William Fairbairn, the Grant Brothers, and\nlastly, to that most admirable man, Benjamin Hick, engineer, Bolton.\nTo narrate in detail all the instances of warm and hospitable\nkindnesses which I received from men in Lancashire, even from the\noutset of my career there, would fill a volume.\n\nI first went to see my friend Edward Tootal, who had given me so kind\na reception in 1830.  I was again cordially received; he now promised\nto befriend me, which he did most effectually.  I next visited John\nChippendale, of the firm of Thomson, Chippendale, and Company, calico\nprinters.  I had met him at a friend's house in London, where he had\noffered, if I ever visited Manchester, to introduce me to some of the\nbest men there.  I accordingly called upon him at his counting-house.\nIt happened to be Tuesday, the market day, when all the heads of\nmanufacturing establishments in and round Manchester met together at\nthe Exchange between 12 and 1; and thus all were brought to a focus in\na very convenient manner.\n\nMr. Chippendale first introduced me to Mr. John Kennedy, one of\nthe most distinguished men in Manchester.  I had a special letter\nof introduction to him from Buchanan of Catrine, and his partner\nSmith of Deanstone.  I explained to him the object of my visit to\nManchester, and he cordially entered into my views.  He left his\noccupation at the time, and went with me to see a place which he\nthought might be suitable for my workshop.  The building was new at\nhand--in Dale Street, Piccadilly.  It had been used as a cotton mill,\nbut was abandoned by the owner in favour of more suitable and extensive\npremises.  It was now let out in flats for manufacturing purposes.\nPower was supplied to each flat from a shaft connected with a large\nmill up the street, the owner of which had power to spare. The flat\nshown to me was 130 feet long by 27 feet wide, and the rent was only\n#50 a year.  I thought the premises very suitable, but I took a night\nto sleep over it.  I thanked Mr. Kennedy very much for his kindness,\nand for the trouble which he had taken on behalf of an unknown\nstranger.\n\nOn this memorable day I had another introduction, through the kindness\nof Mr. Chippendale, which proved of great service to me.  It was to the\nMessrs. Grant, the famous \"Brothers Cheeryble\" of Dickens. I was taken\nto their counting-house in Cannon Street, where I was introduced to\nDaniel Grant.  Although business was at its full height, he gave me a\ncordial reception.  But, to save time, he invited me to come after the\nExchange was over and take \"tiffin\" with him at his hospitable mansion\nin Mosely Street.\n\nThere, he said, I should meet some of the most enterprising men in\nLancashire.  I was most happy, of course, to avail myself of his\ninvitation.  I went thither accordingly, and the first thing that\nDaniel did was to present me in the most cordial manner to \"his noble\nbrother William,\" as he always affectionately called him.  William was\nthe head of the firm, and he, too, gave me a warm and hearty welcome.\nHe asked me to sit beside him at the head of the table.\n\nDuring dinner--for indeed it was such, being the survival of the\nold-fashioned one o'clock dinner of a departing age--William entered\ninto conversation with me.  He took occasion to inquire into the object\nof my visit to Manchester.  I told him, as briefly as I could,\nthat I intended to begin the business of a mechanical engineer on a\nvery moderate scale, and that I had been looking out for premises\nwherein to commence operations.  He seemed interested, and asked more\nquestions.  I related to him my little history, and told him of my\ndesires, hopes, and aspirations.  What was my age?  \"Twenty-six.\"\n\"That is a very young age at which to begin business on your own account\"\n\"Yes; but I have plenty of work in me, and I am very economical.\"\nThen he pressed his questions home.  \"But what is your capital?\"\nI told him that my capital in cash was #63.  \"What!\" he said,\n\"that will do very little for you when Saturday nights come round.\"\n\"That's true,\" I answered; \"but as there will be only myself and Archy\nTorry to provide for, I think I can manage to get along very well until\nprofitable work comes in.\"\n\nHe whispered to me, \"Keep your heart up!\"  With such views, he said,\nI was sure to do well.  And if, he added, on any Saturday night I\nwanted money to pay wages or other expenses, I would find a credit for\n#500 at 3 per cent at his office in Cannon Street, \"and no security.\"\nThese were his very words.  What could have been more generous?\nI could only whisper my earnest thanks for his warm-hearted kindness.\nHe gave me a kindly squeeze of the hand in return, which set me in a\nglow of gladness.  He also gave me a sort of wink that I shall never\nforget--a most knowing wink.  In looking at me he seemed to turn his\neye round and brought his eyebrows down upon it in a sudden and\nextraordinary manner.  I thought it was a mere confirmation of his kind\nadvice to \"keep my heart up!\"  It was not until two years after that\nI found, from a mutual friend, that the eye in question was made of\nglass!  Sometimes the glass eye got slightly out of its place, and\nMr. Grant had to force it in again by this odd contortion of his\neyebrows, which I had translated into all manner of kind intentions.\nAs soon as the party broke up I went to Wren and Bennett, the agents\nfor the flat of the old mill which I had seen in Dale Street.\nI inspected it again, and found that it was in all respects suitable\nfor my purpose.  I may mention in passing that the flat below mine was\nin the occupation of a glass-cutter, whose glass-cutting lathes and\ngrindstones were supplied with power from the same upright shaft that\nwas to serve me in the same manner on the flat above, Encouraged by the\nsupport of William Grant, I immediately entered into a contract for the\npremises as a yearly tenant.  Nothing could have been more happily\narranged for my entering into business as a mechanical engineer and\nmachine tool maker.  The situation of the premises was excellent, being\nin the heart of Manchester There was a powerful crab crane, or hoisting\napparatus, in the upper story, and the main chains came down in front\nof the wide door of my workshop, so that heavy castings or cases of\nmachinery might be lifted up or let down with the utmost case and\nconvenience.  At the same time I was relieved from looking after the\nmoving power and its natural accompaniment of trouble and expense in\nthe way of fuel and attendance.\n\n[Image]  My factory flat at Manchester\n\nWhen I had settled the contract for taking the place, I wrote down to\nEdinburgh by that night's post to tell my father of the happy results\nof my visit to Manchester, and also to inform my right hand man, Archy\nTorry, that I should soon be with him.  He was to prepare for packing\nup my lathes, planing machines, drilling machines, and other smaller\ntools, not forgetting my father's foot lathe, of which I had made such\neffective use.*\n [footnote...\nI have still this foot-lathe in full and perfect and almost daily\naction.  I continue to work with it now, after sixty-three years of\nalmost constant use.  It is a lathe that I duly prize and venerate, not\nonly because it was my father's, but also because it was, in practical\nfact, the progenitor, more or less directly, of all the mechanical\nproductions of my long and active life.\n ...]\n\nI soon followed up my letter.  I was in Edinburgh in a few days' time,\nand had all my tools packed up.  In the course of about ten days\nI returned to Manchester, and was followed by Archy Torry and the\nponderous cases of machinery and engineer's tools.  They were all duly\ndelivered, hoisted to my flat, and put in their proper places.\nI was then ready for work.\n\nThe very first order I received was from my friend Edward Tootal.\nIt was a new metallic piston for the small steam-engine that gave\nmotion to his silk-winding machinery.  It was necessary that it should\nbe done over night, in order that his factory should be at work as\nusual in the morning.\n\nMy faithful Archy and I set to work accordingly.  We removed the old\ndefective piston, and replaced it by a new and improved one, made\naccording to my own ideas of how so important a part of a steam-engine\nshould be constructed.  We conveyed it to Mr. Tootal's factory over\nnight, and by five o'clock in the morning gave it a preliminary trial\nto see that everything was in order.  The \"hands\" came in at six,\nand the machine was set to work.  It was no doubt a very small order,\nbut the piston was executed perfectly and satisfactorily.  The result\nof its easier action, through reduced friction, was soon observable in\nthe smaller consumption of coal.  Mr. Tootal and his brother were\nhighly pleased at my prompt and careful attention to their little\norder, and it was the forerunner of better things to come.\n\nOrders soon came in.  My planing machine was soon fully occupied.\nWhen not engaged in executing other work it was employed in planing the\nflat cast-iron inking tables for printing machines.  These were made in\nconsiderable numbers by Messrs.  Wren and Bennett (my landlords) under\nthe personal superintendence of Ebenezer Cowper, brother of the\ninventor, who, in conjunction with Mr. Applegath, was the first to\nproduce a really effective newspaper printing machine.  I had many\nsmall subsidiary jobs sent to me to execute.  They not only served to\nkeep my machine tools properly employed, but tended in the most\neffective way to make my work known to some of the best firms in\nManchester, who in course of time became my employers.\n\nIn order to keep pace with the influx of work I had to take on fresh\nhands.  I established a smithy down in the cellar flat of the old mill\nin Dale Street, so that all forge work in iron and steel might be\npromptly and economically produced on the premises.  There was a small\niron foundry belonging to a Mr. Heath, about three minutes walk from my\nworkshop, where I had all my castings of iron and brass done with\npromptness, and of excellent quality.  Mr. Heath very much wanted a\nmore powerful steam-engine to drive his cupola blowing fan.  I had made\na steam-engine in Edinburgh and brought it with me.  There it lay in my\nworkshop, where it remained unused, for I was sufficiently supplied\nwith power from the rotating shaft.  Mr. Heath offered to buy it.\nThe engine was accordingly removed to his iron foundry, and I received\nmy full quota of value in castings.\n\nWeek by week my orders grew, and the flat of the old mill soon assumed\na very busy aspect.  By occasionally adding to the number of my lathes,\ndrilling machines, and other engineers' tools, I attracted the\nattention of employers.  When seen in action they not only facilitated\nand economised the production of my own work, but became my best\nadvertisements.  Each new tool that I constructed had some feature of\nnovelty about it.  I always endeavoured after greater simplicity and\nperfectness of workmanship.  I was punctual in all my engagements.\nThe business proved safe and profitable.  The returns were quick.\nSometimes one-third of the money was paid in advance on receipt of the\norder, and the balance was paid on delivery at my own premises.\nAll risk of bad debts was avoided.  Thus I was enabled to carry on my\nbusiness with a very moderate amount of capital.\n\nMy crowded workshop and the active scene it presented, together with\nthe satisfaction my work gave to my employers, induced several persons\nto offer to enter into partnership with me.  Sometimes it was on their\nown account, or for a son or relation for whom they desired an opening.\nBut I fought shy of such proposals.  It was a very riskful affair to\nadmit as partners young men whose character for ability might be very\ndoubtful.  I was therefore satisfied to go on as before. Besides, I had\nthe kind and disinterested offer of the Brothers Grant, which was\nalways available, though, indeed, I did not need to make use of it.\nI had also the good fortune to be honoured by the friendship of Edward\nLloyd, the head of the firm of Jones, Lloyd, and Co.  I had some\nmoderate financial transactions with the bank.  Mr. Lloyd had,\nno doubt, heard something of my industry and economy.  I never asked\nhim for any accommodation; but on one occasion he invited me into his\nparlour, not to sweat me, but to give me some most kindly hints and\nadvice as to the conduct of my financial affairs.  He volunteered an\noffer which I could not but feel proud of.  He said that I should have\na credit of #1000 at my service, at the usual bank rate.  He added,\n\"As soon as you can, lay by a little capital of your own, and baste it\nwith its own gravy!\"  A receipt which I have carefully followed through\nlife, and I am thankful to say with satisfactory results.\n\nBefore I conclude this chapter, let me add something more about my kind\nfriends the Brothers Grant.  It is well that their history should be\nremembered, as the men who personally knew them will soon be all dead.\nThe three brothers, William, Daniel, and John Grant, were the sons of a\nherdsman or cattle-dealer, whose occupation consisted in driving cattle\nfrom the far north of Scotland to the rich pastures of Cheshire and\nLancashire.  The father was generally accompanied by his three sons,\nwho marched barefoot, as was the custom of the north country lads in\nthose days.  Being shrewd fellows, they observed with interest the\nthriving looks and well-fed condition of the Lancashire folks.\nThey were attracted by the print works and cotton mills which lay by\nthe Irwell, as it crept along in its bright and rural valley towards\nManchester.  When passing the works of Sir Robert Peel at Nuttal, near\nBury, they admired the beauty of the situation.  The thought possessed\nthem that they would like to obtain some employment in the neighbourhood.\nThey went together in search of a situation.  It is said that when they\nreached the crown of the hill near Walmsley, from which a beautiful\nprospect is to be seen, they were in doubt as to the line of road which\nthey should pursue.  To decide their course, a stick was put up,\nand they agreed to follow the direction in which it should fall.\nThe stick fell in the direction of Ramsbottom, then a little village in\nthe bottom of the valley, on the river Irwell.  There they went,\nand found employment.\n\nThey were thrifty, economical, and hard-working; and they soon saved\nmoney.  Their savings became capital, and they invested it in a little\nprint work.  Their capital grew, and they went on investing it in print\nworks and cotton mills.\n\nThey became great capitalists and manufacturers; and by their industry,\nability, and integrity, were regarded as among the best men in\nLancashire.  As a memorial of the event which enabled them to take up\ntheir happy home at Ramsbottom, they caused to be erected at the top of\nWalmsley Hill a lofty tower, overlooking the valley, as a kind of\npublic thank-offering for the prosperity and success which they had\nachieved in their new home.  Their well-directed diligence made the\nvalley teem with industry, activity, health, joy, and opulence.\nThey never forgot the working class from which they had sprung, and as\ntheir labours had contributed to their wealth, they spared no expense\nin providing for the moral, intellectual, and physical interests of\ntheir work-people.  Whenever a worthy object was to be achieved,\nthe Brothers Grant were always ready with their hearty and substantial\nhelp. They contributed to found schools, churches, and public buildings,\nand many a deserving man did they aid with their magnanimous bounty.\n\nI may also mention that they never forgot their first impression of the\nsplendid position of the first Sir Robert Peel's works at Nuttal.\nIn course of time Sir Robert had, by his skill and enterprise, acquired\na large fortune, and desired to retire from business.  By this time the\nGrant Brothers had succeeded so well that they were enabled to purchase\nthe whole of his works and property in the neighbourhood.\nThey proceeded to introduce every improvement in the way of machinery\nand calico printing, and thus greatly added to the quality of their\nproductions.  Their name became associated with everything that was\nadmirable.  They abounded in hospitality and generosity.\nIn the course of many long years of industry, enterprise, and benevolence,\nthey earned the goodwill of thousands, the gratitude of many, and the\nrespect of all who knew them.  I was only one of many who had cause to\nremember them with gratefulness.  How could I acknowledge their\nkindness?  There was one way; it was a very small way, but I will\nrelate it.   Soon after my introduction to the Grants, and before I had\nbrought my tools to Manchester, William invited me to join a gathering\nof his friends at Ramsbottom.  The church built at his cost had just\nbeen finished, and it was to be opened with great eclat on the\nfollowing Sunday.  He asked me to be his guest, and I accepted his\ninvitation with pleasure.  As it was a very fine day at the end of May,\nI walked out to Ramsbottom, and enjoyed the scenery of the district.\nHere was the scene of the Grant Brothers' industry and prosperity.\nI met many enterprising and intelligent men, to whom William Grant\nintroduced me.  I was greatly pleased with the ceremonies connected\nwith the opening of the church.\n\nOn the Monday morning William Grant, having seen some specimens of my\nfather's artistic skill as a landscape painter, requested me to convey\nto him his desire that he should paint two pictures--one of Castle\nGrant, the residence of the chief of the Clan Grant, and the other of\nElgin Cathedral.  These places were intimately associated with his\nearly recollections, The brothers had been born in the village\nadjoining Castle Grant; and Elgin Cathedral was one of the principal\nold buildings of the north.  My father replied, saying that he would be\ndelighted to execute the pictures for a gentleman who had given me so\nkindly a reception, but that he had no authentic data--no drawings,\nno engravings--from which to paint them; and that he was now too old\nto visit the places.  I therefore resolved to do what I could to help\nhim to paint the pictures.\n\nAs it was necessary that I should go to London before returning to\nEdinburgh to pack up my machine tools there, I went thither, and after\ndoing my business, I embarked for Dundee by the usual steamer.\nI made my way from there, via Perth and Dunkeld, to Inverness, and from\nthence I proceeded to Elgin.  I made most careful drawings of the\nremains of that noble cathedral.  I endeavoured to include all that was\nmost beautiful in the building and its surrounding scenery.\nI then went on to Castle Grant, through a picturesque and romantic\ncountry.  I found the castle amidst its deep forests of pine, larch,\nelm, and chestnut.  The building consists of a high quadrangular pile\nof many stories, projecting backwards at each end, and pierced with\nwindows of all shapes and sizes.  I did my best to carry away a graphic\nsketch of the old castle and its surroundings:  and then, with my stock\nof drawings, I prepared to return to Inverness on foot.  The scenery\nwas grand and beautiful.  The weather was fine, although after mid-day\nit became very hot.  A thunder storm was evidently approaching.\nThe sun was obscured by a thunder-cloud; the sky flashed with\nlightning, and the rain began to pour down.  I was then high up on a\nwild looking moor, covered with heather and vast boulders.\n\n[Image]  An extemporised shower-bath\n\nThere was no shelter to be had, for not a house was in sight.\nI did not so much mind for my clothes, but I feared very much for my\nsketches.  Taking advantage of the solitude, I stripped myself, put my\nsketches under my clothes, and thrust them into a hollow underneath a\nhuge boulder.  I sat myself down on the top of it, and there I had a\nmagnificent shower-bath of warm rain.  I never enjoyed a bath under\nsuch romantic circumstances.  The thunder-clouds soon passed over my\nhead, and the sun broke out again  cheerily.  When the rain had ceased\nI took out my clothes and drawings from the hollow, and found them\nperfectly dry.  I set out again on my long walk to Inverness;\nand reached it just in time to catch the Caledonian Canal steamer.\nWhile passing down Loch Ness I visited the romantic Fail of Foyers;\nthen through Loch Lochy, past Ben Nevis to Loch Linnhe, Oban, and the\nKyles of Bute, to Glasgow, and from thence to Edinburgh.\n\nI had the pleasure of placing in my father's hands the sketches I had\nmade.  He was greatly delighted with them.  They enabled him to set to\nwork with his usual zeal, and in the course of a short time he was able\nto execute, con amore, the commission of the Brothers Grant.  So soon\nas I had completed my sketches I wrote to Daniel Grant and informed him\nof the result of my journey.  He afterwards expressed himself most\nwarmly as to my prompt zeal in obtaining for him authentic pictures of\nplaces so dear to the brothers, and so much associated with their\nearliest and most cherished recollections.\n\nI have already referred to the Brothers Cowper.  They were among my\nmost attached friends at Manchester.  Many of my most pleasant\nassociations are connected with them.  Edward Cowper was one of the\nmost successful mechanics in bringing the printing machine to a state\nof practical utility.  He was afterwards connected with Mr. Applegath\nof London, the mechanical engineer of the Times newspaper*\n [footnote...\nMr. Koeig's machines, first used at the Times office, were patented in\n1814.  They were too complicated and expensive, and the inking was too\nimperfect for general adoption.  They were superseded by Mr. Edward\nCowper's machine, which he invented and patented in 1816.\nHe afterwards added the inking roller and table to the common press.\nThe effect of Mr. Cowper's invention was to improve the quality and\nspeed of printing, and to render literature accessible to millions of\nreaders.\n ...]\nhe invented for the proprietors a machine that threw off from 4500 to\n5000 impressions in the hour.\n\nIn course of time the Brothers Cowper removed the manufacture of their\nprinting machines from London ,to Manchester.  There they found skilled\nand energetic workmen, ready to carry their plans into effect.\nThey secured excellent premises, supplied with the best modern machine\ntools, in the buildings of Wren and Bennett, about two minutes' walk\nfrom my workshop, which I rented from the same landlords.\n\nI had much friendly intercourse with the Cowpers, especially with\nEbenezer the younger brother, who took up his residence at Manchester\nfor the purpose of specially superintending the manufacture of printing\nmachines.  These were soon in large demand, not only for the printing\nof books but of newspapers.  One of the first booksellers who availed\nhimself of the benefits of the machine was Mr. Charles Knight,\nwho projected the Penny Magazine of 1832, and sold it to the extent of\nabout 180,000 copies weekly.  It was also adopted by the Messrs.\nChambers of Edinburgh, and the proprietors of the Magasin Pittoresque\nof Paris.  The Universities of Oxford and Cambridge also used Cowper's\nmachine in printing vast numbers of bibles and prayer-books, thereby\nreducing their price to one-third of the former cost.  There was\nscarcely a newspaper of any importance in the country that was not\nprinted with a Cowper's machine.\n\nAs I possessed some self-acting tools that were specially suited to\nexecute some of the most refined and important parts of the printing\nmachine, the Messrs.  Cowper transferred their execution to me.  This\nwas a great advantage to both.  They were relieved of the technical\nworkmanship; while I kept my men and machine tools fully employed at\ntimes when they might otherwise have been standing idle.\nBesides, I derived another advantage from my connection with the\nBrothers Cowper, by having frequent orders to supply my small\nsteam-engines, which were found to be so suitable for giving motion to\nthe printing machines.  At first the machines were turned by hand, and\nvery exhausting work it was; but the small steam-engine soon relieved\nthe labourer from his heavy work.\n\nEdward frequently visited Manchester to arrange with his brother as to\nthe increasing manufacture of the printing machines, and also to\nintroduce such improvements in the minor details as the experience and\nspecial requirements of the printing trade suggested.  It was on these\noccasions that I had the happy opportunity of becoming intimately\nacquainted with him; and this resulted in a firm friendship which\ncontinued until the close of his admirable life.  The clear and\nmasterly way in which, by some happy special faculty, he could catch up\nthe essential principles and details of any mechanical combination,\nhowever novel the subject might be, was remarkable; and the quaint and\nhumorous manner in which he treated all such subjects, in no small\ndegree caused his shrewd and intelligent remarks to take a lasting hold\nof the memory.\n\nOn many occasions Edward Cowper gave Friday evening lectures on\ntechnical subjects at the Royal Institution, London.  Next to Faraday,\nno one held the attention of a delighted audience in so charming a\nmanner as he did.  Like Faraday, he possessed the power of clearly\nunveiling his subject, and stripping it of all its complicated\nperplexities.  His illustrations were simple, clear, and understandable.\nTechnical words were avoided as much as possible.  He threw the\nordinary run of lecturers far into the shade.  Intelligent boys and\ngirls could understand him.  Next to Faraday, no one filled the theatre\nof the Institution with such eager and crowded audiences as he did.\nHis choice of subjects, as well as his masterly treatment, always\nrendered his lectures instructive and attractive.  He was one of the\nmost kind-hearted of men, and the cheerful way in which he laid aside\nhis ordinary business to give instruction and pleasure to others\nendeared him to a very wide circle of devoted friends.\n\n\nCHAPTER 11.  Bridgewater Foundry--Partnership.\n\nMy business went on prosperously.  I had plenty of orders, and did my\nbest to execute them satisfactorily.  Shortly after the opening of the\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway there was a largely increased demand\nfor machine-making tools.  The success of that line led to the\nconstruction of other lines, concentrating in Manchester;\nand every branch of manufacture shared in the prosperity of the time.\n\nThere was a great demand for skilled, and even for unskilled labour.\nThe demand was greater than the supply.  Employers were subjected to\nexorbitant demands for increased rates of wages.  The workmen struck,\nand their wages were raised.  But the results were not always\nsatisfactory.  Except in the cases of the old skilled hands, the work\nwas executed more carelessly than before.  The workmen attended less\nregularly; and sometimes, when they ought to have been at work on\nMonday mornings, they did not appear until Wednesday.\nTheir higher wages had been of no use to them, but the reverse.\nTheir time had been spent for the most part in two days' extra drinking.\n\nThe irregularity and carelessness of the workmen naturally proved very\nannoying to the employers.  But it gave an increased stimulus to the\ndemand for self-acting machine tools by which the untrustworthy efforts\nof hand labour might be avoided.  The machines never got drunk;\ntheir hands never shook from excess; they were never absent from work;\nthey did not strike for wages; they were unfailing in their accuracy\nand regularity, while producing the most delicate or ponderous portions\nof mechanical structures.\n\nIt so happened that the demand for machine tools, consequent upon the\nincreasing difficulties with the workmen, took place at the time that I\nbegan business in Manchester, and I had my fair share of the increased\ndemand.  Most of my own machine tools were self-acting--planing\nmachines, slide lathes, drilling, boring, slotting machines, and so on.\nWhen set up in my workshop they distinguished themselves by their\nrespective merits and efficiency.  They were, in fact, their own best\nadvertisements.  The consequence was that orders for similar machines\npoured in upon me, and the floor of my flat became completely loaded\nwith the work in hand.\n\nThe tenant below me, it will be remembered, was a glass-cutter.\nHe observed, with alarm, the bits of plaster from the roof coming down\namong his cut glasses and decanters.  He thought that the rafters\noverhead were giving way, and that the whole of my machinery and\nengines would come tumbling down upon him some day and involve him in\nruin.  He probably exaggerated the danger; still there was some cause\nfor fear.\n\nWhen the massive castings on my floor were moved about from one part to\nanother, the floor quivered and trembled under the pressure.\nThe glass-cutter complained to the landlord, and the landlord\nexpostulated with me.  I did all that I could to equalise the pressure,\nand prevent vibration as much as possible.  But at length, in spite of\nall my care, an accident occurred which compelled me to take measures\nto remove my machinery to other premises.  As this removal was followed\nby consequences of much importance to myself, I must endeavour to state\nthe circumstances under which it occurred.\n\nMy kind friend, John Kennedy, continued to take the greatest interest\nin my welfare.  He called in upon me occasionally.  He admired the\nquality of my work, and the beauty of my self-acting machinery.\nMore than that, he recommended me to his friends.  It was through his\ninfluence that I obtained an order for a high-pressure steam-engine of\ntwenty horse-power to drive the machinery connected with a distillery\nat Londonderry, in Ireland.  I was afraid at first that I could not\nundertake the job.  The size of the engine was somewhat above the\nheight of my flat, and it would probably occupy too much space in my\nalready overcrowded workshop.  At the same time I was most anxious not\nto let such an order pass me.  I wished to please my friend Mr. Kennedy;\nbesides, the execution of the engine might lead to further business.\n\nAt length, after consideration, I undertook to execute the order.\nInstead of constructing the engine perpendicularly, I constructed it\nlying upon its side.  There was a little extra difficulty, but I\nmanaged to complete it in the best style.  It had next to be taken to\npieces for the purpose of being conveyed to Londonderry.  It was then\nthat the accident happened.  My men had the misfortune to allow the end\nof the engine beam to crash through the floor!  There was a terrible\nscattering of lath and plaster and dust.  The glass-cutter was in a\ndreadful state.  He rushed forthwith to the landlord, and called upon\nhim to come at once and judge for himself!\n\nMr. Wren did come, and did judge for himself.  He looked in at the\nglass shop, and saw the damage that had been done amongst the tumblers\nand decanters.  There was the hole in the roof, through which the end\nof the engine beam had come and scattered the lath and plaster.\nThe landlord then came to me.  The whole flat was filled with\nmachinery, including the steam-engine on its side, now being taken to\npieces for the purpose of shipment to Ireland.  Mr. Wren, in the\nkindest manner, begged me to remove from the premises as soon as I\ncould, otherwise the whole building might be brought to the ground with\nthe weight of my machinery.  \"Besides,\" he argued, \"you must have more\nconvenient premises for your rapidly extending business.\"  It was quite\ntrue.  I must leave the place and establish myself elsewhere.\n\nThe reader may remember that while on my journey on foot from Liverpool\nto Manchester in 1830, I had rested myself for a little on the parapet\nof the bridge overlooking the canal near Patricroft, and gazed\nlongingly upon a plot of land situated along the canal side.\nOn the afternoon of the day on which the engine beam crashed through\nthe glass-cutter's roof, I went out again to look at that favourite\npiece of land.  There it was, unoccupied, just as I had seen it some\nyears before.  I went to it and took note of its dimensions.\nIt consisted of about six acres.  It was covered with turf,\nand as flat and neat as a bowling-green.  It was bounded on one side by\nthe Bridgewater Canal, edged by a neat stone margin 1050 feet long,\non another side by the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, while on a\nthird side it was bounded by a good road, accessible from all sides.\nThe plot was splendidly situated.  I wondered that it had not been\nsecured before. It was evidently waiting for me!\n\nI did not allow the grass to grow beneath my feet.  That very night I\nascertained that the proprietor of this most beautiful plot was squire\nTrafford, one of the largest landed proprietors in the district.\nNext morning I proceeded to Trafford Hall for the purpose of\ninterviewing the Squire.  He received me most cordially.  After I had\nstated my object in calling upon him, he said he would be exceedingly\npleased to have me for one of his tenants.  He gave me a letter of\nintroduction to his agent, Mr. Thomas Lee, of Princes Street, Manchester,\nwith whom I was to arrange as to the terms.  I was offered a lease of\nthe six acre plot for 999 years, at an annual rent of 1 3/4d per square\nyard.  This proposal was most favourable, as I obtained the advantage\nof a fee-simple purchase without having to sink capital in the land.\nAll that I had to provide for was the annual rent.\n\nMy next step in this important affair was to submit the proposal to the\njudgment of my excellent friend Edward Lloyd, the banker.  He advised\nme to close the matter as soon as possible, for he considered the terms\nmost favourable.  He personally took me to his solicitors, Dennison,\nHumphreys, and Cunliffe, and introduced me to them.  Mr. Humphreys took\nthe matter in hand.  We went together to Mr.Lee, and within a few days\nthe lease was signed and I was put into possession of the land upon\nwhich the Bridgewater Foundry was afterwards erected.*\n [footnote...\nI called the place the Bridgewater Foundry as an appropriate and humble\ntribute to the memory of the first great canal maker in Britain the\nnoble Duke of Bridgewater.  My ground was on the first mile of the\nBridgewater Canal which the Duke had constructed under the\nsuperintendence of Brindley, so that it might well be considered,\nin an Engineering sense, \"classic ground.\"\n ...]\n\nI may mention briefly the advantages of the site.  The Bridgewater Canal,\nwhich lay along one side of the foundry communicated with every\nwaterway and port in England whilst the railway alongside enabled a\ncommunication to be kept up by rail with every part of the country.\nThe Worsley coal-boats came alongside the wharf, and a cheap and\nabundant supply of fuel was thus insured.  The railway station was near\nat hand, and afforded every opportunity for travelling to and from the\nworks, while I was at the same time placed within twenty minutes of\nManchester.\n\nAnother important point has to be mentioned.  A fine bed of brick-clay\nlay below the surface of the ground, which supplied the material for\nbricks.  Thus the entire works may be truly said to have \"risen out of\nthe ground;\" for the whole of the buildings rested upon the land from\nwhich the clay below was dug and burned into bricks.  Then, below the\nclay lay a bed of New Red Sandstone rock, which yielded a solid\nfoundation for any superstructure, however lofty or ponderous.\n\nAs soon as the preliminary arrangements for the lease of the six acre\nplot had been made, I proceeded to make working drawings of a temporary\ntimber workshop; as I was anxious to unload the floor of my flat in\nDale Street, and to get as much of my machinery as possible speedily\nremoved to Patricroft.  For the purpose of providing the temporary\naccommodation, I went to Liverpool and purchased a number of logs of\nNew Brunswick pine.  The logs were cut up into planks, battens, and\nroof-timbers, and were delivered in a few days at the canal wharf in\nfront of my plot.  The building of the workshops rapidly proceeded.\nBy the aid of some handy active carpenters, superintended by my\nenergetic foreman, Archy Torry, several convenient well-lighted\nworkshops were soon ready for the reception of my machinery.\nI had a four horsepower engine, which I had made at Edinburgh,\nready to be placed in position, together with the boiler.\nThis was the first power I employed in starting my new works.\n\nI must return for a moment to the twenty horse-power engine, which had\nbeen the proximate cause of my removal from Dale Street.  It was taken\nto pieces, packed, and sent off to Londonderry.  When I was informed\nthat it was erected and ready for work I proceeded to Ireland to see it\nbegin it's operations.\n\nI may briefly say that the engine gave every satisfaction,\nand I believe that it continues working to this day.  I had the\npleasure of bringing back with me an order for a condensing engine of\nforty horse-power, required by Mr. John Munn for giving motion to his\nnew flax mill, then under construction.  I mention this order because\nthe engine was the first important piece of work executed at the\nBridgewater Foundry.\n\nThis was my first visit to Ireland.  Being so near the Giant's Causeway,\nI took the opportunity, on my way homewards, of visiting that object of\nhigh geologic interest, together with the magnificent basaltic\npromontory of Fairhead.  I spent a day in clambering up the\nterrible-looking crags.  In a stratum of red hematite clay, underneath\na solid basaltic crag of some sixty feet or more in thickness, I found\nthe charred branches of trees--the remains of some forest that had,\nat some inconceivably remote period, been destroyed by a vast\nout-belching flow of molten lava from a deep-seated volcanic store\nunderneath.\n\nI returned to Patricroft, and found the wooden workshops nearly\nfinished.  The machine tools were, for the most part, fixed and ready\nfor use.  In August 1836 the Bridgewater foundry was in complete and\nefficient action.  The engine ordered at Londonderry was at once put in\nhand, and the concern was fairly started in its long career of\nprosperity.  The wooden workshops had been erected upon the grass.\nBut the sward soon disappeared.  The hum of the driving belts,\nthe whirl of the machinery, the sound of the hammer upon the anvil,\ngave the place an air of busy activity.  As work increased, workmen\nincreased. The workshops were enlarged.  Wood gave place to brick.\nCottages for the accommodation of the work-people sprang up in the\nneighbourhood; and what had once been quiet grassy fields became the\ncentre of a busy population.\n\n[Image] Bridgewater Foundry.  From a sketch by Alexander Nasmyth.\n\nIt was a source of vast enjoyment to me, while engaged in the anxious\nbusiness connected with the establishment of the foundry, to be\nsurrounded with so many objects of rural beauty.  The site of the works\nbeing on the west side of Manchester, we had the benefit of breathing\npure air during the greater part of the year.  The scenery round about\nwas very attractive.  Exercise was a source of health to the mind as\nwell as the body.   As it was necessary that I should reside as near as\npossible to the works, I had plenty of opportunities for enjoying the\nrural scenery of the neighbourhood.  I had the good fortune to become\nthe tenant of a small cottage in the ancient village of Barton,\nin Cheshire, at the very moderate rental of #15 a year.  The cottage\nwas situated on the banks of the river Irwell, and was only about\nsix minutes' walk from the works at Patricroft.  It suited my moderate\ndomestic arrangements admirably.\n\nThe village was surrounded by apple orchards and gardens, and situated\nin the midst of tranquil rural scenery.  It was a great treat to me,\nafter a long and busy day at the foundry, especially in summer time,\nto take my leisure walks through the green lanes, and pass the many\npicturesque old farmhouses and cottages which at that time presented\nsubjects of the most tempting kind for the pencil.  Such quiet summer\nevening strolls afforded me the opportunity for tranquil thought.\nEach day's transactions furnished abundant subjects for consideration.\nIt was a happy period in my life.  I was hopeful for the future,\nas everything had so far prospered with me.\n\nWhen I had got comfortably settled in my cosy little cottage, my dear\nsister Margaret came from Edinburgh to take charge of my domestic\narrangements.  By her bright and cheerful disposition she made the\ncottage a very happy home.  Although I had neither the means nor the\ndisposition to see much company, I frequently had visits from some of\nmy kind friends in Manchester.  I valued them all the more for my\nsister's sake, inasmuch as she had come from a bright household in\nEdinburgh, full of cheerfulness, part of which she transferred to my\ncottage.\n\nAt the same time, it becomes me to say a word or two about the great\nkindness which I received from my friends and well-wishers at\nManchester and the neighbourhood.  Amongst these were the three\nbrothers Grant, Benjamin Hick of Bolton, Edward Lloyd the banker,\nJohn Kennedy, and William Fairbairn.  I had not much leisure during the\nweek days, but occasionally on Sunday afternoons my sister and myself\nenjoyed their cordial hospitality.  In this way I was brought into\nfriendly intercourse with the most intelligent and cultivated persons\nin Lancashire.  The remembrance of the delightful evenings I spent in\ntheir society will ever continue one of the most cherished\nrecollections of my early days in Manchester.\n\nI may mention that one of the principal advantages of the site of my\nworks was its connection with the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,\nas well as with the Bridgewater Canal.  There was a stone-edged roadway\nalong the latter, where the canal barges might receive and deliver\ntraffic in the most convenient manner.  As the wharfage boundary was\nthe property of the trustees of the Bridgewater Canal, it was necessary\nto agree with them as to the rates to be charged for the requisite\naccommodation.  Their agent deferred naming the rent until I had finally\nsettled with Squire Trafford as to the lease of his land, and then,\nafter he supposed he had got me into a cleft stick, he proposed so\nextravagant a rate that I refused to use the wharf upon his terms.\n\nIt happened, fortunately for me, that this agent had involved himself\nin a Chancery suit with the trustees, which eventually led to his\nretirement.  The property then merged into the hands of Lord Francis\nEgerton, heir to the Bridgewater Estates.  The canal was placed under\nthe management of that excellent gentleman, James Loch, M.P.\nLord Francis Egerton, on his next visit to Worsley Hall, called upon me\nat the foundry.  He expressed his great pleasure at having us as his\nnear neighbours, and as likely to prove such excellent customers of the\ncanal trustees.  Because of this latter circumstance, he offered me the\nuse of the wharf free of rent.  This was quite in accordance with his\ngenerous disposition in all matters.  But as I desired the agreement to\nbe put in a regular business-like form, I arranged with Mr. Loch to pay\n5s. per annum as a formal acknowledgment, and an agreement to this\neffect was accordingly drawn up and signed by both parties.\n\nLord Francis Egerton was soon after created Earl of Ellesmere.\nHe became one of the most constant visitors at the foundry, in which he\nalways took a lively interest.  He delighted to go through the workshops,\nand enjoy the sight of the active machinery and the work in progress.\nWhen he had any specially intelligent visitors at Worsley Hall, which\nwas frequently the case, he was sure to bring them down to the foundry\nin his beautiful private barge, and lead them through the various\ndepartments of the establishment.  One of his favourite sights was the\npouring out of the molten iron into the moulds for the larger class of\ncastings; when some twelve or sixteen tons, by the aid of my screw\nsafety ladle, were decanted with as much neatness and exactness as the\npouring out of a glass of wine from a decanter.  When this work was\nperformed towards dark, Lord Ellesmere's poetic fancy and artistic eye\nenabled him to enjoy the sight exceedingly.*\n [footnote...\nI had the happiness to receive the kindest and most hospitable\nattention from Lord Ellesmere and his family.  His death, which\noccurred in 1857, at the early age of fifty-seven, deprived me of one\nof my warmest friends.  The Countess of Ellesmere continued the\nfriendship until her death, which occurred several years later.\nThe same kindly feelings still exist in the children of the lamented\npair, all of whom evince the admirable qualities which so peculiarly\ndistinguished their parents, and made them universally beloved by all\nclasses, rich and poor.\n ...]\n\nI must here say a few words as to my Screw Safety Ladle.\nI had observed the great danger occasioned to workmen by the method of\nemptying the molten iron into the casting moulds.  The white-hot fluid\nwas run from the melting furnace into a large ladle with one or two\ncross handles and levers, worked by a dozen or fifteen men.  The ladle\ncontained many tons of molten iron, and was transferred by a crane to\nthe moulds.  To do this required the greatest caution and steadiness.\nIf a stumble took place, and the ladle was in the slightest degree\nupset, there was a splash of hot metal on the floor, which, in the\nrecoil, flew against the men's clothes, set them on fire, or occasioned\nfrightful scalds and burns.\n\n[Image]  Old foundry ladle\n\nTo prevent these accidents I invented my Safety Foundry Ladle.\nI applied a screw wheel, keyed to the trunnion of the ladle, which was\nacted on by an endless screw attached to the sling of the ladle;\nand by this means one man could move the largest ladle on its axis,\nand pour out its molten contents with the most perfect ease and safety.\nNot only was all risk of accident thus removed, but the perfection of\nthe casting was secured by the steady continuous flow of the white-hot\nmetal into the mould.  The nervous anxiety and confusion that usually\nattended the pouring of the metal required for the larger class of\ncastings was thus entirely avoided.\n\n[Image]  Safety foundry ladle\n\nAt the same time I introduced another improvement in connection with\nthese foundry ladles which, although of minor importance, has in no\nsmall degree contributed to the perfection of large castings.\nThis consisted in hanging \"the skimmer\" to the edge of the ladle,\nso as to keep back the scorae that invariably float on the surface of\nthe melted metal.  This was formerly done by hand, and many accidents\nwere the consequence.  But now the clear flow of pure metal into the\nmoulds was secured, while the scoriae were mechanically held back.\nAll that the attendant has to do is to regulate the inclination of the\nSkimmer so as to keep its lower edge sufficiently under the surface of\nthe outflowing metal.  The preceding illustrations will enable the\nreader to understand these simple but important technical improvements.\n\nThese inventions were made in 1838.  I might have patented them,\nbut preferred to make them over to the public.  I sent drawings and\ndescriptions of the Safety Foundry Ladle to all the principal founders\nboth at home and abroad; and I was soon after much gratified by their\ncordial expression of its practical value.  The ladle is now\nuniversally adopted.  The Society of Arts of Scotland, to whom I sent\ndrawings and descriptions, did me the honour to present me with their\nlarge silver medal in acknowledgment of the invention.\n\nIn order to carry on my business with effectiveness it was necessary\nthat I should have some special personal assistance.  I could carry on\nthe whole \"mechanical\" department as regards organisation, designing,\nand construction; but there was the \"financial\" business to be attended\nto,--the counting-house, the correspondence, and the arrangement of\nmoney affairs.  I wanted some help with respect to these outer matters.\n\nWhen I proceeded to take my plot of land at Patricroft some of my\nfriends thought it a very bold stroke, especially for a young man who\nhad been only about three years in business.  Nevertheless, there were\nothers who watched my progress with special interest, and were willing\nto join in my adventure--though adventure it was not. They were ready\nto take a financial interest in my affairs. They did me the compliment\nof thinking me a good investment, by offering to place their capital\nin my concern as sleeping partners.  But I was already beyond the\n\"sleeping partner\" state of affairs.  Whoever joined me must work as\nenergetically as I did, and must give the faculties of his mind to the\nprosperity of the concern.  I communicated the offers I had received to\nmy highly judicious friend Edward Lloyd.  He was always willing to\nadvise me, though I took care never to encroach upon his kindness.\nHe concurred with my views, and advised me to fight shy of\nsleeping partners.  I therefore continued to look out for a working\npartner.  In the end I was fortunate.  My friend, Mr. Thomas Jeavons,\nof Liverpool, having been informed of my desire, made inquiries,\nand found the man likely to suit me.  He furnished him with a letter\nof introduction to me, which he presented one day at the works.\n\nThe young man became my worthy partner, Holbrook Gaskell.\nHe had served his time with Yates and Cox, iron merchants, of Liverpool.\nHaving obtained considerable experience in the commercial details of\nthat business, and being possessed of a moderate amount of capital,\nhe was desirous of joining me, and embarking his fortune with mine.\nHe was to take charge of the counting-house department, and conduct\nsuch portion of the correspondence as did not require any special\ntechnical knowledge of mechanical engineering.  The latter must\nnecessarily remain in my hands, because I found that the \"off-hand\"\nsketches which I introduced in my letters as explanatory of mechanical\ndesigns and suggestions were much more intelligible than any amount of\nwritten words.\n\nI was much pleased with the frank and friendly manner of Mr. Gaskell,\nand I believe that the feeling between us was mutual.  With the usual\nstraight forwardness that prevails in Lancashire, the articles of\npartnership were at once drawn up and signed, and the firm of Nasmyth\nand Gaskell began.  We continued working together with hearty zeal for\na period of sixteen successive years; and I believe Mr. Gaskell had no\nreason to regret his connection with the Bridgewater Foundry.\n\nThe reason of Mr. Gaskell leaving the concern was the state of his\nhealth.  After his long partnership with me, he was attacked by a\nserious illness, when his medical adviser earnestly recommended him to\nretire from all business affairs.  This was the cause of his reluctant\nretirement.  In course of time the alarming symptoms departed,\nand he recovered his former health.  He then embarked in an extensive\nsoda manufactory, in conjunction with one of our pupils, whose taste\nfor chemistry was more attractive to him than engine-making.\nA prosperous business was established, and at the time I write these\nlines Mr. Gaskell continues a hale and healthy man, the possessor of a\nlarge fortune, accumulated by the skilful manner in which he has\nconducted his extensive affairs.\n\n\nCHAPTER 12. Free Trade in Ability--The Strike--Death of my Father\n\nI had no difficulty in obtaining abundance of skilled workmen in South\nLancashire and Cheshire.  I was in the neighbourhood of Manchester,\nwhich forms the centre of a population gifted with mechanical instinct.\nFrom an early period the finest sort of mechanical work has been turned\nout in that part of England.  Much of the talent is inherited.\nIt descends from father to son, and develops itself from generation to\ngeneration.  I may mention one curious circumstance connected with the\npedigree of Manchester:  that much of the mechanical excellence of its\nworkmen descends from the Norman smiths and armourers introduced into\nthe neighbourhood at the Norman Conquest by Hugo de Lupus, the chief\narmourer of William the Conqueror, after the battle of Hastings, in 1066.\n\nI was first informed of this circumstance by William Stubbs of\nWarrington, then maker of the celebrated \"Lancashire files.\"\nThe \"P. S.,\" or Peter Stubbs's files, were so vastly superior to\nother files, both in the superiority of the steel and in the perfection\nof the cutting, which long retained its efficiency, that every workman\ngloried in the possession and use of such durable tools.\nBeing naturally interested in everything connected with tools and\nmechanics, I was exceedingly anxious to visit the factory where these\nadmirable files were made.  I obtained an introduction to William Stubbs,\nthen head of the firm, and was received by him with much cordiality\nwhen I asked him if I might be favoured with a sight of his factory,\nhe replied that he had no factory, as such; and that all he had to do\nin supplying his large warehouse was to serve out the requisite quantities\nof pure cast steel as rods and bars to the workmen; and that they,\non their part, forged the metal into files of every description at\ntheir own cottage workshops, principally situated in the neighbouring\ncounties of Cheshire and Lancashire.\n\nThis information surprised as well as pleased me.  Mr. Stubbs proceeded\nto give me an account of the origin of this peculiar system of cottage\nmanufacture in his neighbourhood.  It appears that Hugo de Lupus,\nWilliam the Conqueror's Master of Arms, the first Earl of Chester,\nsettled in North Cheshire shortly after the Conquest.  He occupied\nHalton Castle, and his workmen resided in Warrington and the adjacent\nvillages of Appleton, Widnes, Prescot, and Cuerdley.\nThere they produced coats of steel, mail armour, and steel and\niron weapons, under the direct superintendence of their chief.\n\nThe manufacture thus founded continued for many centuries.\nAlthough the use of armour was discontinued, the workers in steel and\niron still continued famous.  The skill that had formerly been employed\nin forging chain armour and war instruments was devoted to more\npeaceful purposes.  The cottage workmen made the best of files and\nsteel tools of other kinds.  Their talents became hereditary, and the\nmanufacture of wire in all its forms is almost peculiar to Warrington\nand the neighbourhood.  Mr. Stubbs also informed me that most of the\nworkmen's peculiar names for tools and implements were traceable to old\nNorman-French words.  He also stated that at Prescot a peculiar class\nof workmen has long been established, celebrated for their great skill\nin clock and watchmaking; and that, in his opinion, they were the\ndirect descendants of a swarm of workmen from Hugo de Lupus's original\nNorman hive of refined metal-workers, dating from the time of the\nConquest.  To return to my narrative.  In the midst of such a\nhabitually industrious population, it will be obvious that there was no\ndifficulty in finding a sufficient supply of able workmen.  It was for\nthe most part the most steady, respectable, and well-conducted classes\nof mechanics who sought my employment--not only for the good wages\nthey received, but for the sake of their own health and that of their\nfamilies; for it will be remembered that the foundry and the workmen's\ndwellings were surrounded by the fresh, free, open country.\nIn the course of a few years the locality became a thriving colony of\nskilled mechanics.  In order to add to the accommodation of the\nincreasing numbers, an additional portion of land, amounting to eight\nacres, was leased from Squire Trafford on the same terms as before.\nOn this land suitable houses and cottages for the foremen and workmen\nwere erected.  At the same time substantial brick workshops were built\nin accordance with my original general plan, to meet the requirements\nof our rapidly expanding business, until at length a large and\ncommodious factory was erected, as shown in the annexed engraving.\n\n[Image]  Bridgewater Foundry Patricroft.\n         From a painting by Alexander Nasmyth.\n\nThe village of Worsley, the headquarters of the Bridgewater Canal,\nsupplied us with a valuable set of workmen.  They were, in the first\nplace, labourers; but, like all Lancashire men, they were naturally\npossessed of a quick aptitude for mechanical occupations connected with\nmachinery.  Our chief employment of these so-called labourers was in\ntransporting heavy castings and parts of machinery from one place to\nanother.  To do this properly required great care and judgment,\nin order that the parts might not be disturbed, and that the mechanics\nmight proceed towards their completion without any unnecessary delay.\nNone but those who have had practical acquaintance with the importance\nof having skilful labourers to perform these apparently humble,\nbut in reality very important functions, can form an adequate idea of\nthe value of such services.\n\nAll the requisite qualities we required were found in the Worsley\nlabourers.  They had been accustomed to the heaviest class of work in\nconnection with the Bridgewater Canal.  They had been thoroughly\ntrained in the handling of all manner of ponderous objects.\nThey performed their work with energy and willingness.  It was quite a\ntreat to me to look on and observe their rapid and skilful operations\nin lifting and transporting ponderous portions of machinery, in which a\nvast amount of costly work had been embodied.  After the machines or\nengines had been finished, it was the business of the same workmen to\nremove them from the workshops to the railway-siding alongside the\nfoundry, or to the boats at the canal wharf.  In all these matters the\nWorsley men could be thoroughly depended upon.\n\nWhere they showed the possession, in any special degree, of a true\nmechanical faculty, I was enabled to select from the working labourers\nthe most effective men to take charge of the largest and most powerful\nmachine tools--such as planing machines, lathes, and boring machines.\nThe ease and rapidity with which they caught up all the technical arts\nand manipulations connected with the effective working of these\nmachines was extraordinary.  The results were entirely satisfactory to\nmyself, as well as to the men themselves, by the substantial rise in\ntheir wages which followed their advancement to higher grades of\nlabour.  Thus I had no difficulty in manning my machine tools by\ndrawing my recruits from this zealous and energetic class of Worsley\nlabourers.   It is by this \"selection of the fittest\" that the true\nsource of the prosperity of every large manufacturing establishment\ndepends.  I believe that Free Trade in Ability has a much closer\nrelation to national prosperity than even Free Trade in Commodities.\n\nBut here I came into collision with another class of workmen--those\nwho are of opinion that employers should select for promotion, not\nthose who are the fittest and most skilful, but those who have served a\nseven years' apprenticeship and are members of a Trades' Union.\nIt seemed to me that this interference with the free selection and\npromotion of the fittest was at variance with free choice of the best\nmen, and that it was calculated, if carried out, to strike at the root\nof the chief source of our prosperity.  If every workman of the same\nclass went in the same rut, and were paid the same uniform rate of\nwages, irrespective of his natural or acquired ability, such a system\nwould destroy the emulative spirit which forms the chief basis of\nmanipulative efficiency and practical skill, and on which, in my\nopinion, the prosperity of our manufacturing establishments mainly\ndepends.  But before I proceed to refer to the strike of Unionists,\nwhich for a time threatened to destroy, or at all events to impede the\nspirit of enterprise and the free choice of skilful workmen, in which I\ndesired to conduct the Bridgewater Foundry, I desire to say a few words\nabout those excellent helpers, the foremen engineers, who zealously\nhelped me in my undertaking from beginning to end.\n\nI must place my most worthy, zealous, and faithful Archy Torry at the\ntop of the list.  He rose from being my only workman when I first\nstarted in Manchester, to be my chief general foreman.  The energy and\ndevotion which he brought to bear upon my interests set a high example\nto all in my employment.  Although he was in some respects deficient in\nhis knowledge of the higher principles of engineering and mechanical\nconstruction, I was always ready to supply that defect.  His hearty\nzeal and cheerful temper, and his energetic movement when among the\nmen, had a sympathetic influence upon all about him.  His voice had the\nsame sort of influence upon them as the drum and fife on a soldier's\nmarch:  it quickened their movements.  We were often called in by our\nneighbour manufacturers to repair a breakdown of their engines.\nThat was always a sad disaster, as all hands were idle until the repair\nwas effected.  Archy was in his glory on such occasions.  By his ready\nzeal and energy he soon got over the difficulty, repaired the engines,\nand set the people to work again. He became quite famous in these cases\nof extreme urgency.  He never spared himself, and his example had an\nexcellent effect upon every workman under him.\n\nAnother of my favourite workshop lieutenants was James Hutton.\nHe had been leading foreman to my worthy friend George Douglass,\nof Old Broughton, Edinburgh.  He was fully ten years my senior,\nand when working at Douglass's I looked up to him as a man of\nauthority.  I had obtained from him many a valuable wrinkle in\nmechanical and technical construction.  After I left Edinburgh he had\nemigrated to the United States for the purpose of bettering his\ncondition.  But he promised me that if disappointed in his hopes of\nsettling there, he should be glad to come into my service if I was ever\nin a position to give him employment.  Shortly after my removal to\nPatricroft, and when everything had been got into full working order,\nI received a letter from him in which he said that he was anxious to\nreturn to England, and asking if there was any vacancy in our\nestablishment that he might be employed to fill up.  It so happened\nthat the foremanship of turners was then vacant.  I informed Hutton of\nthe post; and on his return to England he was duly enrolled in our\nstaff.\n\nThe situation was a very important one, and Hutton filled it admirably.\nHe was a sound practical man, and thoroughly knew every department of\nengineering mechanism.  As I had provided small separate rooms or\noffices for every department of the establishment for the use of the\nforemen, where they kept their memoranda and special tools, I had often\nthe pleasure of conferring with Hutton as to some point of interest, or\nwhen I wished to pass my ideas and designs through the ordeal of his\njudgment, in order that I might find out any lurking defect in some\nproposed mechanical arrangement.  Before he gave an opinion, Hutton\nalways took a pinch of snuff to stimulate his intellect, or rather to\ngive him a little time for consideration.  He would turn the subject\nover in his mind.  But I knew that I could trust his keenness of\ninsight.  He would give his verdict carefully, shrewdly, and truthfully.\nHutton remained a faithful and valued servant in the concern for nearly\nthirty years, and died at a ripe old age.  Notwithstanding his\nmechanical intelligence, Hutton was of too cautious a temperament to\nhave acted as a general foreman or manager, otherwise he would have\nbeen elevated to that position.  A man may be admirable in details,\nbut be wanting in width, breadth, and largeness of temperament and\nintellect.  The man who possesses the latter gifts becomes great in\norganisation; he soon ceases to be a \"hand,\" and becomes a \"head,\"\nand such men generally rise from the employed to be the employer.\n\nAnother of my excellent assistants was John Clerk.  He had been for a\nlong time in the service of Fairbairn and Lillie; but having had a\nserious difference with one of the foremen, he left their service with\nexcellent recommendations.  I soon after engaged him as foreman of the\npattern-making department.  He was a most able man in some of the more\nimportant branches of mechanical engineering.  He had, besides,\nan excellent knowledge of building operations.  I found him of great\nuse in superintending the erection of the additional workshops which\nwere required in proportion as our business extended. He made out\nfull-sized chalk-line drawings from my original pencil sketches,\non the large floor of the pattern store, and from these were formed the\nworking drawings for the new buildings.  He had a wonderful power of\nrapidity and clearness in apprehending new subjects, and the way in\nwhich he depicted them in large drawings was quite masterly.\nJohn Clerk and I spent many an hour on our knees together on the\npattern store floor, and the result of our deliberations usually was\nsome substantial addition to the workshops of the foundry, or some\nextra large and powerful machine tool.  This worthy man left our\nservice to become a partner in an engineering concern in Ireland;\nand though he richly deserved his promotion, he left us to our very\ngreat regret.\n\nThe last of our foremen to whom I shall refer was worthy Thomas\nCrewdson.  He entered our service as a smith, in which pursuit he\ndisplayed great skill.  We soon noted the high order of his natural\nability; promoted him from the ranks, and made him foreman of the\nsmith's and forge-work department.  In this he displayed every quality\nof excellence, not only in seeing to the turning out of the forge work\nin the highest state of perfection, but in managing the men under his\ncharge with such kind discretion as to maintain the most perfect\nharmony in the workshops.  This is always a matter of great importance\n--that the foreman should inspire the workmen with his own spirit,\nand keep up their harmony and activity to the most productive point.\nCrewdson was so systematic in his use of time that we found that he was\nable also to undertake the foremanship of the boiler-making department,\nin addition to that of the smith work; and to this he was afterwards\nappointed, with highly satisfactory results to all concerned.\n\nSo strongly and clearly impressed is my mind with the recollection of\nthe valuable assistance which I received during my engineering life\nfrom those vicegerents of practical management at Patricroft,\nthat I feel that I cannot proceed further in my narrative without thus\nplacing the merits of these worthy men upon record.  It was a source of\ngreat good fortune to me to be associated with them, and I consider\nthem to have been among the most important elements in the prosperity\nof the Bridgewater Foundry.  There were many others, in comparatively\nhumble positions, whom I have also reason to remember with gratitude.\nIn all well-conducted concerns the law of \"selection of the fittest\"\nsooner or later comes into happy action, when a loyal and attached set\nof men work together harmoniously for their own advantage as well as\nfor that of their employers.\n\nIt was not, however, without some difficulty that we were allowed to\ncarry out our views as to Free Trade in Ability.  As the buildings were\nincreased, more men were taken on--from Manchester, Bolton, Liverpool,\nas well as from more distant places.  We were soon made to feel that\nour idea of promoting workmen according to their merits, and advancing\nthem to improved positions and higher wages in proportion to their\nskill, ability, industry, and natural intelligence, was quite contrary\nto the views of many of our new employees.  They took advantage of a\nlarge access of orders for machinery, which they knew had come into the\nfoundry, to wait upon us suddenly, and to lay down their Trade Union\nlaw for our observance.\n\nThe men who waited upon us were deputed by the Engineer Mechanics'\nTrades' Union to inform us that there were men in our employment who\nwere not, as they termed it, \"legally entitled to the trade;\" that is,\nthey had never served a regular seven years' apprenticeship.\n\"These men,\" said the delegates, \"are filling up the places,\nand keeping out of work, the legal hands.\"  We were accordingly\nrequested to discharge the workmen whom we had promoted, in order to\nmake room for members of the Trades' Union.\n\nTo have complied with this request would have altered the whole\nprinciples and practice on which we desired to conduct our business.\nI wished, and my partner agreed with me, to stimulate men to steadfast\nand skilful work by the hope of promotion.  It was thus that I had\ntaken several of the Worsley men from the rank of labourers, and raised\nthem to the class mechanics with correspondingly higher wages.\nWe were perfectly satisfied with the conduct of these workmen, and with\nthe productive results of their labour.  We thought it fair to them as\nwell as to ourselves to resist the order to discharge them, and we\nconsequently firmly refused to submit to the dictation of the\nUnionists.\n\nThe delegates left us with a distinct intimation that if we continued\nto retain the illegal men in our employment they would call out the\nUnion men, and strike until \"the grievance \" was redressed.\nThe Unionists, no doubt, fixed upon the right time to place their case\nbefore us.  We wanted more workmen to execute the advantageous orders\nwhich had come in; and they thought that the strike would put an entire\nstop to our operations.  On engaging the workmen we had never up to\nthis time concerned ourselves with the question of whether they\nbelonged to the Trades' Union or not.  The only proof we required of a\nman was Ability.  If, after a week's experience, he proved himself an\nefficient workman, we engaged him.\n\nThe strike took place.  All the Union men were \"called out,\" and left\nthe works.  Many of them expressed their great regret at leaving us,\nas they were perfectly satisfied with their employment as well as with\ntheir remuneration.  But they were nevertheless compelled to obey the\nmandate of the Council.  The result was that more than half of our men\nleft us.  Those who remained were very zealous.  Nothing could exceed\ntheir activity and workfulness.  We appealed to our employers.\nThey were most considerate in not pressing us for the speedy execution\nof the work we had in hand.  We made applications in the neighbourhood\nfor other mechanics in lieu of those who had left us. But the men on\nstrike, under orders from the Union, established pickets round the\nworks, who were only too efficient in preventing those desirous of\nobtaining employment from getting access to the foundry.\n\nOur position for a time seemed to be hopeless.  We could not find\nworkmen enough to fill our shops or to execute our orders.\nWhat were we to do under the circumstances?  We could not find mechanics\nin the neighbourhood; but might they not, be found elsewhere?\nWhy not bring them from a distance?  We determined to try.\nAdvertisements were inserted in the Scotch newspapers, announcing our\nwant of mechanics, smiths, and foundrymen.  We appointed an agent in\nEdinburgh, to whom applications were to be made.  We were soon in\nreceipt of the welcome intelligence that numbers of the best class of\nmechanics had applied, and that our agent's principal difficulty\nconsisted in making the proper selection from amongst them.\n\nA selection was, however, made of over sixty men, who appeared in every\nrespect likely to suit us.  With true Scotch caution they deputed two\nof their number to visit our works and satisfy themselves as to the\nreal state of the case.  We had great pleasure in receiving these two\nclear-headed cautious pioneers.  We showed them over the workshops,\nand pointed out the habitations in the neighbourhood with their\nattractive surroundings.  The men returned to their constituents,\nand gave such a glowing account of their mission that we had no\ndifficulty in obtaining the men we required.  Indeed, we might easily\nhave obtained three times the number of efficient mechanics.\nSixty-four of the most likely men were eventually selected, men in the\nzenith of their physical powers.  We made arrangements for their\nconveyance to Glasgow, from whence they started for Liverpool by\nsteamer.  They landed in a body at the latter port, many of them\naccompanied by their wives and children, and eight-day clocks!\nA special train was engaged for the conveyance of the whole--men,\nwomen, and children, bag and baggage--from Liverpool to Patricroft,\nwhere suitable accommodation had been provided for them.\n\nThe arrival of so powerful a body of men made a great sensation in the\nneighbourhood.  The men were strong, respectable looking, and well\ndressed.  The pickets were \"dumfoundered.\"  They were brushed to one\nside by the fresh arrivals.  They felt that their game was up, and they\nsuddenly departed.  The men were taken over the workshops, with which\nthey appeared quite delighted.  They were told to be ready to start\nnext morning at six, after which they departed to their lodgings.\nThe morning arrived and the gallant sixty-four were all present.\nAfter allotting to each his special work, they gave three hearty\ncheers, and dispersed throughout the workshops.\n\nWe had no reason to regret the results which were effected through the\nstrike ordered by the Trades' Union.  The new men worked with a will.\nThey were energetic, zealous, and skilful.  They soon gave evidence of\ntheir general handiness and efficiency in all the departments of work\nin which they were engaged.  We were thus enabled to carry out our\npractice of Free Trade in Ability in our own way, and we were no longer\ninterfered with in our promotion of workmen who served us best.\nIn short, we had scotched the strike; we conquered the Union in their\nwily attempt to get us under their withering control; and the\nBridgewater Foundry resumed its wonted activity in every department.\n\nIt was afterwards a great source of happiness to me to walk through the\nvarious workshops and observe the cheerful and intelligent countenances\nof the new men, and to note the energetic skill with which they used\ntheir tools in the advancement of their work.  General handiness is one\nof the many valuable results that issues from the practice of handling\nthe variety of materials which are more or less employed in mechanical\nstructures.  At the time that I refer to, the skilful workmen employed\nin the engineering establishments of Scotland (which were then\ncomparatively small in size) were accustomed to use all manner of\nmechanical tools.  They could handle with equally good effect the saw,\nthe plane, the file, and the chisel; and, as occasion required, they\ncould exhibit their skill at the smith's forge with the hammer and the\nanvil.  This was the kind of workmen with which I had reinforced the\nfoundry.  The men had been bred to various branches of mechanics.\nSome had been blacksmiths, others carpenters, stone masons, brass or\niron founders; but all of them were handy men.  They merely adopted the\noccupation of machine and steam-engine makers because it offered a\nwider field for the exercise of their skill and energy.\n\nI may here be allowed to remark that we owe the greatest advances in\nmechanical invention to Free Trade in Ability.  If we look carefully\ninto the narratives of the lives of the most remarkable engineers,\nwe shall find that they owed very little to the seven years' rut in\nwhich they were trained.  They owed everything to innate industry,\nenergy, skill, and opportunity.  Thus, Brindley advanced from the\nposition of a millwright to that of a canal engineer; Smeaton and Watt,\nfrom being mathematical instrument makers, advanced to higher\npositions,--the one to be the inventor of the modern lighthouse,\nthe other to be the inventor of the condensing steam-engine.\nSome of the most celebrated mechanical and civil engineers--such as\nRennie, Cubitt, and Fairbairn--were originally millwrights.\nAll these men were many-handed.  They had many sides to their intellect.\nThey were resourceful men.  They afford the best illustrations of the\nresult of Free Trade in Ability.\n\nThe persistent aim at an indolent equality which Union men aim at,\nis one of the greatest hindrances to industrial progress.\nWhen the Union Delegates called upon me to insist that none but men who\nhad served seven years' apprenticeship should be employed in the works,\nI told them that I preferred employing a man who had acquired the\nrequisite mechanical skill in two years rather than another who was so\nstupid as to require seven years' teaching.  The delegates regarded\nthis statement as preposterous and heretical.  In fact, it was utter\nhigh treason.  But in the long run we carried our point.\n\nIt is true, we had some indenture-bound apprentices.  These were pupils\nwho paid premiums.  In certain cases we could not very well refuse to\ntake them.  Some of them caused a great deal of annoyance and\ndisturbance.  They were irregular in their attendance, consequently\nthey could not be depended upon for the regular operations of the\nfoundry.  They were careless in their work, and set a bad example to\nthe others.  We endeavoured to check this disturbing element by\nstipulating that the premium should be payable in six months' portions,\nand that each party should be free to terminate the connection at the\nend of each succeeding six months.  By this system we secured more care\nand regularity on the part of the pupil apprentices; as, while it\nchecked inattention and irregularity, it offered a direct and\nsubstantial encouragement to zeal and industry.\n\nBut the arrangement which we greatly preferred was to employ\nintelligent well-conducted young lads, the sons of labourers or\nmechanics, and advance them by degrees according to their merits.\nThey took charge of the smaller machine tools, by which the minor\ndetails of the machines in progress were brought into exact form\nwithout having recourse to the untrustworthy and costly process of\nchipping and filing.  A spirit of emulation was excited amongst the\nlads.  They vied with each other in executing their work with\nprecision.  Those who excelled were paid an extra weekly wage.\nIn course of time they took pride, not only in the quantity but in the\nquality of their work; and in the long run they became skilful\nmechanics.  We were always most prompt to recognise their progress in a\nsubstantial manner.  There was the most perfect freedom between\nemployer and employed.  Every one of these lads was at liberty to leave\nat the end of each day's work.  This arrangement acted as an\never-present check upon master and apprentice.  The only bond of union\nbetween us was mutual interest.  The best of the lads remained in our\nservice because they knew our work and were pleased with the\nsurroundings; while we on our part were always desirous of retaining\nthe men we had trained, because we knew we could depend upon them.\nNothing could have been more satisfactory than the manner in which this\nsystem worked.\n\nIn May 1835 I had the great happiness of receiving a visit from my dear\nfather.  I was then in Dale Street, Manchester, where my floor was\noverloaded with the work in progress.  My father continued to take a\ngreat interest in mechanical undertakings, and he was pleased with the\nprosperity which had followed my settlement in this great manufacturing\ncentre.  He could still see his own lathe, driven by steam power,\nin full operation for the benefit of his son.  His fame as an artist\nwas well known in Manchester, for many of his works were possessed by\nthe best men of the town.  I had the pleasure of introducing him to the\nBrothers Grant, John Kennedy, Edward Lloyd, George Murray, James Frazer,\nWilliam Fairbairn, and Hugh and Joseph Birley, all of whom gave him a\nmost cordial welcome, and invited him to enjoy their hospitality.\n\n[Image]  Alexander Nasmyth.  After a cameo by Samuel Joseph\n\nIn 1838 he visited me again.  I had removed to Patricroft, and\nthe Bridgewater Foundry was in full operation.  My father was then in\nhis eightieth year.  He was still full of life and intellect.\nHe was vastly delighted in witnessing the rapid progress which I had\nmade since his first visit.  He took his daily walk through the\nworkshops, where many processes were going on which greatly interested\nhim.  He was sufficiently acquainted with the technical details of\nmechanical work to enjoy the sight, especially when self-acting tools\nwere employed.  It was a great source of pleasure to him to have\n\"a crack\" with the most intelligent foremen and mechanics.  These,\non their part, treated him with the most kind and respectful attention.\nThe Scotch workmen regarded him with special veneration.  They knew\nthat he had been an intimate friend of Robert Burns, their own\nbest-beloved poet, whose verses shed a charm upon their homes, and were\nrecited by the fireside, in the fields, or at the workman's bench.\n\nThey also knew that he had painted the only authentic portrait of their\nnational bard.  This fact invested my father with additional interest\nin their eyes.  Their respect for him culminated in a rather\nextraordinary demonstration.  On the last day of his visit the leading\nScotch workmen procured \"on the sly\" an arm-chair, which they fastened\nto two strong bearing poles.  When my father left the works at the\nbell-ringing at mid-day, he was approached by the workmen,\nand respectfully requested to \"take the chair.\"  He refused; but it was\nof no use.  He was led to the chair, and took it.  He was then raised\nand carried in triumph to my house.  He was carefully set down at the\nlittle garden-gate, where the men affectionately took leave of him,\nand ended their cordial good wishes for his safe return home with three\nhearty cheers.  I need scarcely say that my father was greatly affected\nby this kind demonstration on the part of the workmen.\n\nHis life was fast drawing to a close.  He had borne the heat and burden\nof the day; and was about to be taken home like a shock of corn in full\nseason.  After a long and happy life, blessed and cheered by a most\naffectionate wife, he laid down his brushes and went to rest.\nIn his later years he rejoiced in the prosperity of his children,\nwhich was all the more agreeable as it was the result of the example of\nindustry and perseverance which he had ever set before them.\nMy father untiringly continued his professional occupations until 1840,\nwhen he had attained the age of eighty-two.  His later works may be\nfound wanting in that degree of minute finish which characterised his\nearlier productions; but in regard to their quality there was no\nfalling off, even to the last picture which he painted. The delicate\nfinish was amply compensated by the increase in general breadth and\neffectiveness, so that his later works were even more esteemed by his\nbrother-artists.   The last picture he painted was finished eight days\nbefore his death.  It was a small work.  The subject was a landscape\nwith an autumnal evening effect.  There was a picturesque cottage in\nthe middle distance, a rustic bridge over a brook in the foreground,\nand an old labouring man, followed by his dog, wearily passing over it\non his way towards his home.  From the chimney of his cottage a thin\nstreak of blue smoke passed upward through the tranquil evening air.\nAll these incidents suggested the idea, which no doubt he desired to\nconvey, of the tranquil conclusion of his own long and active life,\nwhich was then, too evidently, drawing to a close.\nThe shades of evening had come on when he could no longer see to work,\nand he was obliged to lay down his pencil.  My mother was at work with\nher needle close by him; and when he had finished he asked her what he\nshould call the picture.  Not being ready with an answer, he leant back\nin his chair, feeling rather faint, and said, \"Well, I think I had\nbetter call it Going Home.\"  And so it was called.\n\nNext morning his strength had so failed him that he could not get up.\nHe remained there for eight days, and then he painlessly and tranquilly\npassed away.  While on his deathbed he expressed the desire that his\nremains should be placed beside those of a favourite son who had died\nin early youth.  \"Let me lie,\" he said, \"beside my dear Alick.\"\nHis desire was gratified.  He was buried beside his son in St. Cuthbert's\nchurchyard, under the grandest portion of the great basaltic rock on\nwhich Edinburgh Castle stands.  His grave is marked by a fine Runic Cross,\nadmirably sculptured by Rhind of Edinburgh.\n\n[Image]  Monument to Alexander Nasmyth\n\nOne of the kindest letters my mother received after her great loss was\none from Sir David Wilkie.  It was dated 18th April 1840.  \"I hasten,\"\nhe said, \"to assure you of my most sincere condolence on your severe\naffliction, feeling that I can sympathise in the privation you suffer\nfrom losing one who was my earliest professional friend, whose art I at\nall times admired, and whose society and conversation was perhaps the\nmost agreeable that I ever met with.  \" He was the founder of the\nLandscape Painting School of Scotland, and by his taste and talent has\nfor many years taken a lead in the patriotic aim of enriching his\nnative land with the representations of her romantic scenery; and,\nas the friend and contemporary of Ramsay, of Gavin Hamilton, and the\nRuncimans, may be said to have been the last remaining link that unites\nthe present with the early dawn of the Scottish School of Art.\"\nI may add that my mother died six years later, in 1846, at the same age\nas my father, namely eighty-two.\n\n\nCHAPTER 13. My Marriage--The Steam Hammer\n\nBefore I proceed to narrate the later events of my industrial life,\nit is necessary to mention, incidentally, an important subject.\nAs it has been the source of my greatest happiness in life,\nI cannot avoid referring to it.\n\nI may first mention that my earnest and unremitting pursuit of all\nsubjects and occupations, such as I conceived were essential to the\nacquirement of a sound practical knowledge of my profession, rendered\nme averse to mixing much in general society.  I had accordingly few\nopportunities of enjoying the society of young ladies.  Nevertheless,\noccasions now and then occurred when bright beings passed before me\nlike meteors.  They left impressions on my memory, which in no small\ndegree increased the earnestness of my exertions to press forward in my\nendeavours to establish myself in business, and thereby acquire the\nmeans of forming a Home of my own.\n\nMany circumstances, however, conspired to delay the ardently longed for\ncondition of my means, such as should induce me to solicit some dear\none to complete my existence by her sweet companionship, and enter with\nme into the most sacred of all the partnerships of life. In course of\ntime I was rewarded with that success which, for the most part,\nensues upon all honourable and unremitting business efforts.\nThis cheered me on; although there were still many causes for anxiety,\nwhich made me feel that I must not yet solicit some dear heart to\nforsake the comforts of an affluent home to share with me what I knew\nmust for some years to come be an anxious and trying struggle for\ncomfort and comparative independence.  I had reached my thirtieth year\nbefore I could venture to think that I had securely entered upon such a\ncourse of prosperity as would justify me in taking this the most\nimportant step in life.\n\nIt may be a trite but not the less true remark that some of the most\nimportant events originate in apparently chance occurrences and\ncircumstances, which lead up to results that materially influence and\neven determine the subsequent course of our lives.  I had occasion to\nmake a business journey to Sheffield on the 2d of March 1838, and also\nto attend to some affairs of a similar character at York.  As soon as I\nhad completed my engagement at Sheffield, I had to wait for more than\ntwo dreary hours in momentary expectation of the arrival of the coach\nthat was to take me on to York.  The coach had been delayed by a deep\nfall of snow, and was consequently late.  When it arrived, I found that\nthere was only one outside place vacant; so I mounted to my seat.\nIt was a very dreary afternoon, and the snow was constantly falling.\n\nAs we approached Barnsley I observed, in the remaining murky light of\nthe evening, the blaze of some ironwork furnaces near at hand.\nOn inquiring whose works they were, I was informed that they belonged\nto Earl Fitzwilliam, and that they were under the management of a\nMr. Hartop.  The mention of this name, coupled with the sight of the\nironworks, brought to my recollection a kind invitation which\nMr. Hartop had given me while visiting my workshop in Manchester to\norder some machine tools, that it I ever happened to be in his\nneighbourhood, he would be most happy to show me anything that was\ninteresting about the ironworks and colliery machinery under his\nmanagement.\n\nI at once decided to terminate my dreary ride on the top of the coach.\nI descended, and with my small valise in hand I trudged over some\ntrackless snow-covered fields, and made my way by the shortest cut\ntowards the blazing iron furnaces.  On reaching them I was informed\nthat Mr. Hartop had just gone to his house, which was about a mile\ndistant.  I accordingly made my way thither the best that I could\nthrough the deep snow.  I met with a cordial welcome, and with the\nhospitable request that I should take up my quarters there for the\nnight, and have a round of the ironworks and the machinery on the\nfollowing day.  I cheerfully acceded to the kind invitation.\nI was then introduced to his wife and daughter in a cosy room, where I\nspent a most pleasant evening.  As Mr. Hartop was an enthusiast in all\nmatters relating to mechanism and mechanical engineering subjects\ngenerally, we found plenty to converse about; while his wife and daughter,\nat their needlework, listened to our discussions with earnest and\nintelligent attention.\n\nOn the following day I was taken a round of the ironworks,\nand inspected their machinery, as well as that of the collieries,\nin the details of which Mr. Hartop had introduced many common-sense and\nmost effective improvements.  All of these interested me, and gave me\nmuch pleasure.  In the evening we resumed our \"cracks\" on many subjects\nof mutual interest.  The daughter joined in our conversation with the\nmost intelligent remarks; for, although only in her twenty-first year,\nshe had evidently made good use of her time, aided by her clear natural\nfaculties of shrewd observation.  Mr. Hartop having met with some\nserious reverse of fortune, owing to the very unsatisfactory conduct of\na partner, had in a manner to begin business life again on his own\naccount; and although he had to reduce his domestic establishment\nconsiderably in consequence, there was in all its arrangements a degree\nof neatness and perfect systematic order, combined with many evidences\nof elegant taste and good sense which pervaded the whole, that enhanced\nin no small degree the attractiveness of the household.  The chief of\nthese, however, was to me their daughter Anne!  I soon perceived in her,\nmost happily and attractively combined, all the conditions that I could\nhope for and desire to meet with in the dear partner of my existence.\n\nAs I had soon to proceed on my journey, I took the opportunity of\ntelling her what I felt and thought, and so ardently desired in regard\nto our future intercourse.  What little I did say was to this great\npurpose; and, so far as I could judge, all that I said was received in\nthe best spirit that I could desire.  I then communicated my hopes and\nwishes to the parents.  I explained to them my circumstances, which\nhappily were then beginning to assume an encouraging prospect,\nand realising, in a substantial form, a return for the earnest\nexertions that I had made towards establishing a home of my own.\nThey expressed their concurrence in the kindest manner; and it was\narranged that if business continued to progress as favourably as I\nhoped, our union should take place in about two years from that time.\n\nEverything went on hopefully and prosperously.  The two years that\nintervened looked very long in some respects, and very short in others;\nfor I was always fully occupied, and labour shortens time.  At length\nthe two years came to an end.  My betrothed and myself continued of the\nsame mind.  The happy \"chance\" event of our meeting on the evening of\nthe 2d of March 1838 culminated in our marriage at the village church\nof Wentworth on the 16th of June 1840--a day of happy memory!\nFrom that day to this the course of our united hearts and lives has\ncontinued to run on with steady uninterrupted harmony and mutual\nhappiness.  Forty-two years of our married life finds us the same\naffectionate and devoted \"cronies\" that we were at the beginning;\nand there is every prospect that, under God's blessing, we shall\ncontinue to be so to the end.\n\nI was present at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,\non the 15th of September 1830.  Every one knows the success of the\nundertaking.  Railways became the rage.  They were projected in every\npossible direction.  They were first made between all the large towns,\nafter which branches were constructed to place the whole country in\nconnection with the main lines.  Coaches were driven off the road,\nand everything appeared to be thrown into a state of confusion.\nPeople wondered greatly at the new conditions of travelling;\nand they flocked from all quarters to see the railway at work.\n\nWhen the line was opened from Edinburgh to Glasgow, a shepherd and his\nwife came from beyond the Pentlands to see the train pass.\nOn it came, and flashed out of sight in a minute.\n\"How wonderful are the works o' man!\" exclaimed the shepherd.\n\"But what's a' the hurry for?\", rejoined his wife.\nStill more marvellous, however, was the first adventure by train of an\nold woman from Newtyle to Dundee.  In those days the train was let down\npart of the railway by a rope.  The woman was on her way down hill,\nwith a basket of eggs by her side.  Suddenly the rope broke, and the\ntrain dashed into the Dundee Station, scattering the carriages,\nand throwing out the old woman and her basket of broken eggs.\nA porter ran to her help, when, gathering herself together,\nshe exclaimed, \"Odd sake, sirs, d'ye aye whummil*\n [footnote...\nWhummil, to turn upside down.--Jamieson's Scottish Dictionary.\n ...]\nus oot this way?\"  She thought it was only the ordinary way of\ndelivering railway passengers.\n\nRopes, however, were merely exceptional methods of working railway\ntrains.  Eventually locomotives were invariably adopted.  When railways\nwere extended in so many directions, more and more locomotives were\nrequired to work them.\n\nWhen George Stephenson was engaged in building his first locomotive at\nKillingworth, he was greatly hampered, not only by the want of handy\nmechanics, but by the want of efficient tools.  But he did the best\nthat he could.  His genius overcame difficulties.  It was immensely to\nhis credit that he should have so successfully completed his engines\nfor the Stockton and Darlington, and afterwards for the Liverpool and\nManchester Railway.\n\nOnly a few years had passed, and self-acting tools were now enabled to\ncomplete, with precision and uniformity, machines that before had been\ndeemed almost impracticable.\n\nIn proportion to the rapid extension of railways the demand for\nlocomotives became very great.  As our machine tools were peculiarly\nadapted for turning out a large amount of first-class work, we directed\nour attention to this class of business.  In the course of about ten\nyears after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,\nwe executed considerable orders for locomotives for the London and\nSouthampton, the Manchester and Leeds, and the Gloucester railway\ncompanies.\n\nThe Great Western Railway Company invited us to tender for twenty of\ntheir very ponderous engines.  They proposed a very tempting condition\nof the contract.  It was, that if, after a month's trial of the\nlocomotives, their working proved satisfactory, a premium of #100 was\nto be added to the price of each engine and tender.  The locomotives\nwere made and delivered; they ran the stipulated number of test miles\nbetween London and Bristol in a perfectly satisfactory manner;\nand we not only received the premium, but, what was much more\nencouraging, we received a special letter from the Board of Directors,\nstating their entire satisfaction with the performance of our engines,\nand desiring us to refer other contractors to them with respect to the\nexcellence of our workmanship.  This testimonial was altogether\nspontaneous, and proved extremely valuable in other quarters.\n\nI may mention that, in order to effect the prompt and perfect execution\nof this order, I contrived several special machine tools, which\nassisted us most materially.  These tools for the most part rendered us\nmore independent of mere manual strength and dexterity, while at the\nsame time they increased the accuracy and perfection of the work.\nThey afterwards assisted us in the means of perfecting the production\nof other classes of work.  At the same time they had the important\neffect of diminishing the cost of production, as was made sufficiently\napparent by the balance-sheet prepared at the end of each year.\nMy connection with the Great Western Company shortly led to a most\nimportant event in connection with my own personal history. It appears\nthat their famous steam-ship the Great Western  had been very\nsuccessful in her voyages between Bristol and New York; so much so,\nindeed, that the directors of the Company ordered the construction of\nanother vessel of much greater magnitude--the Great Britain.\nMr. Francis Humphries, their engineer, came to Patricroft to consult\nwith me as to the machine tools, of unusual size and power, which were\nrequired for the construction of the immense engines of the proposed\nship, which were to be made on the vertical trunk principle.\nVery complete works were erected at Bristol for the accommodation of\nthe requisite machinery.  The tools were made according to Mr. Humphries'\norder; they were delivered and fitted to his entire approval, and the\nconstruction of the gigantic engines was soon in full progress.\n\nAn unexpected difficulty, however, was encountered with respect to the\nenormous wrought-iron intermediate paddleshaft.  It was required to be\nof a size and diameter the like of which had never been forged.\nMr. Humphries applied to the largest forges throughout the country for\ntenders of the price at which they would execute this important part of\nthe work, but to his surprise and dismay he found that not one of them\ncould undertake so large a forging.  In this dilemma he wrote a letter\nto me, which I received on the 24th of November 1839, informing me of\nthe unlooked-for difficulty.  \"I find,\" he said, \"that there is not a\nforge hammer in England or Scotland powerful enough to forge the\nintermediate paddle-shaft of the engines for the Great Britain!\nWhat am I to do?  Do you think I might dare to use cast-iron?\n\nThis letter immediately set me a-thinking.  How was it that the\nexisting hammers were incapable of forging a wrought-iron shaft of\nthirty inches diameter?  Simply because of their want of compass, of\nrange and fall, as well as of their want of power of blow.\nA few moment's rapid thought satisfied me that it was by our rigidly\nadhering to the old traditional form of a smith's hand hammer--\nof which the forge and tilt hammer, although driven by water or steam\npower, were merely enlarged modifications--that the difficulty had\narisen; as, whenever the largest forge hammer was tilted up to its full\nheight, its range was so small that when a piece of work of considerable\nsize was placed on the anvil, the hammer became \"gagged;\" so that,\nwhen the forging required the most powerful blow, it received next to\nno blow at all, as the clear space for the fall of the hammer was\nalmost entirely occupied by the work on the anvil.\n\nThe obvious remedy was to contrive some method by which a ponderous\nblock of iron should be lifted to a sufficient height above the object\non which it was desired to strike a blow, and then to let the block\nfull down upon the forging, guiding it in its descent by such simple\nmeans as should give the required precision in the percussive action of\nthe falling mass following up this idea, I got out my \"Scheme Book,\"\non the pages of which I generally thought out, with the aid of pen and\npencil, such mechanical adaptations as I had conceived in my mind,\nand was thereby enabled to render them visible. I then rapidly sketched\nout my Steam Hammer, having it all clearly before me in my mind's eye.\nIn little more than half an hour after receiving Mr. Humphries' letter\nnarrating his unlooked-for difficulty, I had the whole contrivance in\nall its executant details, before me in a page of my Scheme Book,\na reduced photographed copy of which I append to this description.\nThe date of this first drawing was the 24th November, 1839.\n\n[Image]  First drawing of steam hammer, 24th Nov.  1839\n\nMy Steam Hammer as thus first sketched, consisted of, first, a massive\nanvil on which to rest the work; second, a block of iron constituting\nthe hammer or blow-giving portion; and, third, an inverted steam\ncylinder to whose piston-rod the hammer-block was attached.\nAll that was then required to produce a most effective hammer was\nsimply to admit steam of sufficient pressure into the cylinder,\nso as to act on the under-side of the piston, and thus to raise the\nhammer-block attached to the end of the piston rod.  By a very simple\narrangement of a slide valve, under the control of all attendant,\nthe steam was allowed to escape and thus permit the massive block of\niron rapidly to descend by its own gravity upon the work then upon the\nanvil.\n\nThus, by the more or less rapid manner in which the attendant allowed\nthe steam to enter or escape from the cylinder, any required number or\nany intensity of blows could be delivered.  Their succession might be\nmodified in an instant.  The hammer might be arrested and suspended\naccording to the requirements of the work.  The workman might thus,\nas it were, think in blows.  He might deal them out on to the ponderous\nglowing mass, and mould or knead it into the desired form as if it were\na lump of clay; or pat it with gentle taps according to his will,\nor at the desire of the forgeman.\n\nRude and rapidly sketched out as it was, this, my first delineation of\nthe steam hammer, will be found to comprise all the essential elements\nof the invention.  Every detail of the drawing retains to this day the\nform and arrangement which I gave to it forty-three years ago.\nI believed that the steam hammer would prove practically successful;\nand I looked forward to its general employment in the forging of heavy\nmasses of iron.  It is no small gratification to me now, when I look\nover my rude and hasty first sketch, to find that I hit the mark so\nexactly, not only in the general structure but in the details;\nand that the invention as I then conceived it and put it into shape,\nstill retains its form and arrangements intact in the thousands of\nsteam hammers that are now doing good service in the mechanical arts\nthroughout the civilised world.\n\nBut to return to my correspondence with the Great Western Steamship\nCompany.  I wrote at once to Mr. Humphries, and sent him a sketch of my\nproposed steam hammer.  I told him that I felt assured he would now be\nable to overcome his difficulty, and that the paddle-shaft of the Great\nBritain might now be forged.  Mr. Humphries was delighted with my\ndesign.  He submitted it to Mr. Brunel, engineer-in-chief of the\nsteamship:  to Mr. Guppy, the managing director; and to other persons\ninterested in the undertaking,--by all of whom it was heartily\napproved.  I accordingly gave the Company permission to communicate my\ndesign to such forge proprietors as might feel disposed to erect the\nsteam hammer, the only condition that I made being, that in the event\nof its being adopted I was to be allowed to supply it in accordance\nwith my design.\n\nBut the paddle-shaft of the Great Britain was never forged.  About that\ntime the substitution of the Screw for the paddle-wheel as a means of\npropulsion was attracting much attention.  The performances of the\nArchimedes, as arranged by Mr. Francis P. Smith, were so satisfactory\nthat Mr. Brunel, after he had made an excursion in that vessel,\nrecommended the directors to adopt the new propelling power. After much\ndiscussion, they yielded to his strongly-urged advice.  The consequence\nwas, that the great engines which Mr. Humphries had so elaborately\ndesigned, and which were far advanced in construction, were given up,\nto his inexpressible regret and mortification, as he had pinned his\nhighest hopes as a practical engineer on the results of their\nperformance.  And, to crown his distress, he was ordered to produce\nfresh designs of engines specially suited for screw propulsion.\nMr. Humphries was a man of the most sensitive and sanguine constitution\nof mind.  The labour and the anxiety which he had already undergone,\nand perhaps the disappointment of his hopes, proved too much for him;\nand a brain fever carried him off after a few days' illness.\nThere was thus, for a time, an end of the steam hammer required for\nforging the paddle-shaft of the Great Britain.\n\nVery bad times for the iron-trade, and for all mechanical undertakings,\nset in about this time.  A wide-spread depression affected all\nconditions of industry Although I wrote to the heads of all the great\nfirms, urging the importance of my invention, and forwarding designs of\nmy steam hammer, I was unable to obtain a single order.  It is true,\nthey cordially approved of my plan, and were greatly struck by its\nsimplicity, unity, and apparent power.*\n [footnote...\nAmong the heads of firms who sent me cordial congratulations on my\ndesign, were Benjamin Hick, of the Soho Ironworks, Bolton, a man,\nwhose judgment in all matters connected with engineering and mechanical\nconstruction was held in the very highest regard;\nMessrs. Rushton and Eckersley, Bolton Ironworks;\nMessrs. Howard and Ravenhill, Rotherhithe Ironworks, London;\nMessrs. Hawkes, Crashaw, and Company, Newcastle-upon-Tyne;\nGeorge Thorneycroft, Wolverhampton; and others.\n ...]\n\n\nBut the substance of their replies was, that they had not sufficient\norders to keep the forge hammers they already possessed in work.\nThey promised, however, that in the event of trade recovering from its\ndepression, they would probably adopt the new power.\n\nIn the meantime my invention was taken up in an entirely new and\nunexpected quarter.  I had for some years been supplying foreign\ncustomers with self-acting machine tools.  The principals of\ncontinental manufacturing establishments were accustomed to make\nfrequent visits to England for the purpose of purchasing various\nmachine tools required for the production of the ponderous as well as\nthe lighter parts of their machinery.  We gave our foreign visitors\nevery facility and opportunity for seeing our own tools at work,\nand they were often so much pleased that, when they came to order one\nspecial tool, they ended by ordering many,--the machine tools in full\nactivity thus acting as their most effective advertisements.\nIn like manner I freely opened my Scheme Book to any foreign visitors.*\n [footnote...\nSome establishments in the same line of business were jealous of the\nvisit of foreigners; but to our views, restriction in the communication\nof new ideas on mechanical subjects to foreigners of intelligence and\nenterprising spirit served no good purpose, as the foreign engineer was\ncertain to obtain all the information he was in quest of from the\ndrawings in the Patent Office, or from the admirable engravings\ncontained in the engineering publications of the day.  It was better to\nderive the advantage of supplying them with the machines they were in\nquest of, than to wait until the demand was supplied by foreigners\nthemselves.\n ...]\n\nThere I let them see the mechanical thoughts that were passing through\nmy mind, reduced to pen and ink drawings.  I did not hesitate to\nadvocate the advantage of my steam hammer over every other method of\nforging heavy masses of iron; and I pointed out the drawing in my\nScheme Book in confirmation of my views.  The book was kept in the\noffice to be handy for such occasions; and in many cases it was the\nmeans of suggesting ideas of machine tools to our customers, and thus\nled to orders which might not have been obtained without this effective\nmethod of prompting them.  Amongst our foreign visitors was M. Schneider,\nproprietor of the great ironworks at Creuzot, in France.\nWe had supplied him with various machine tools, and he was so pleased\nwith their action that the next time he came to England he called at\nour office at Patricroft.  M. Bourdon, his mechanical manager,\naccompanied him.\n\nI happened to be absent on a journey at the time; but my partner,\nMr. Gaskell, was present.  After showing them over the works, as an act\nof courtesy he brought them my Scheme Book and allowed them to examine\nit.  He pointed out the drawing of my steam hammer, and told them the\npurpose for which it was intended.  They were impressed with its\nsimplicity and apparent practical utility,--so much so, that M. Bourdon\ntook careful notes and sketches of the constructive details of the hammer.\n\nI was informed on my return of the visit of MM.Schneider and Bourdon,\nbut the circumstance of their having inspected the designs in my Scheme\nBook, and especially my original design of the steam hammer, was\nregarded by my partner as too ordinary and trivial an incident of their\nvisit to be mentioned to me.  The exhibition of my mechanical designs\nto visitors at the Foundry was a matter of almost daily occurrence.\nI was, therefore, in entire ignorance of the fact that these foreign\nvisitors had taken with them to France a copy of the plan and details\nof my steam hammer.\n\nIt was not until my visit to France in April 1842 that the upshot of\ntheir visit was brought under my notice in an extraordinary manner.\nI was requested by M. Bouchier, Minister of Marine, to visit the\nFrench dockyards and arsenals for the purpose of conferring with the\ndirector of each with reference to the supply of various machine tools\nfor the proper equipment of the marine engine factories in connection\nwith the Royal Dockyards.  In order to render this journey more\neffective and instructive, I visited most of the French engineering\nestablishments which had been supplied with machine tools by our firm.\nAmongst these was of course the famous firm of Schneider, whose works at\nCreuzot lay not far out of the way of my return journey accordingly\nmade my way thither, and found M. Bourdon at his post, though M. Schneider\nwas absent.\n\nM. Bourdon received me with much cordiality.  As he spoke English with\nfluency I was fortunate in finding him present, in order to show me\nover the works; on entering which, one of the things that particularly\nstruck me was the excellence of a large wrought-iron marine engine\nsingle crank, forged with a remarkable degree of exactness in its\ngeneral form.  I observed also that the large eye of the crank had been\npunched and drifted with extraordinary smoothness and truth.\nI inquired of M. Bourdon \"how that crank had been forged?\"\nHis immediate reply was, \"It was forged by your steam hammer!\"\n\nGreat was my surprise and pleasure at hearing this statement.\nI asked him how he had come to be acquainted with my steam hammer?\nHe then narrated the circumstance of his visit to the Bridgewater\nFoundry during my absence.  He told me of my partner having exhibited\nto him the original design, and how much he was struck by its\nsimplicity and probable efficiency; that he had taken careful note and\nsketches on the spot; that among the first things he did after his\nreturn to Creuzot was to put in hand the necessary work for the\nerection of a steam hammer; and that the results had in all respects\nrealised the high expectations he had formed of it.\n\nM. Bourdon conducted me to the forge department of the works,\nthat I might, as he said, \"see my own child;\" and there it was,\nin truth--a thumping child of my brain.  Until then it had only\nexisted in my scheme book; and yet it had often and often been before\nmy mind's eye in full action.  On inspecting the steam hammer I found\nthat Bourdon had omitted some important details, which had led to a few\nmishaps, especially with respect to the frequent breaking of the\npiston-rod at its junction with the hammer block.  He had effected this,\nin the usual way, by means of a cutter wedge through the rod;\nbut he told me that it often broke through the severe jar during the\naction of the hammer.  I sketched for him, then and there, in full size\non a board,the elastic packing under the end of the piston-rod,\nwhich acted, as I told him, like the cartilage between the bones of the\nvertebrae, preventing the destructive effects of violent jars.\nI also communicated to him a few other important details, which he had\nmissed in his hasty inspection of my design.  Indeed, I felt great\npleasure in doing so, as I found Bourdon to be a most intelligent\nmechanic, and thoroughly able to appreciate the practical value of the\ninformation I communicated to him.  He expressed his obligation to me\nin the warmest terms, and the alterations which he shortly afterwards\neffected in the steam hammer, in accordance with my plans, enabled it\nto accomplish everything that he could desire.\n\nI had not yet taken out a patent for the steam hammer.  The reason was\nthis.  The cost of a patent at the time I invented it was little short\nof #500, all expenses included.  My partner was unwilling to lay out so\nlarge a sum upon an invention for which there seemed to be so little\ndemand at that time; and I myself had the whole of my capital embarked\nin the concern.  Besides, the general depression still continued in the\niron trade; and we had use for every farthing of money we possessed.\nI had been warned of the risk I ran by freely exhibiting my original\ndesign, as well as by sending drawings of it to those who I thought\nwere most likely to bring the invention into use.  But nothing had as\nyet been done in England.  It was left for France, as I have described,\nto embody my invention in an actual steam hammer.  I now became\nalarmed, and feared lest I should lose the benefits of  my invention.\nAs my partner declined to help me, I applied to my brother-in-law,\nWilliam Bennett.  He was a practical engineer, and had expressed\nhimself as highly satisfied with its value.  He had also many times\ncautioned me against \"publishing\" its advantages so widely, without\nhaving first protected it by a patent. He was therefore quite ready to\ncome to my assistance.  He helped me with the necessary money, and the\ninvention was placed in a position of safety so far as my interests\nwere concerned.  In return for his kindness I stipulated that the\nreimbursement of his loan should be a first charge upon any profits\narising from the manufacture of the steam hammer; and also that he\nshould have a share in the profits during the period of the patent\nrights.  Mr. Bennett lived for many years, rejoicing in the results of\nhis kindness to me in the time of my difficulty.  I may add that the\npatent was secured in June 1842, or less than two months after my\nreturn from France.\n\nSoon after this, the iron trade recovered from its depression.\nThe tide of financial prosperity of the Bridgewater Foundry soon set\nin, and my partner's sanguine confidence in my ability to raise it to\nthe condition of a thriving and prosperous concern was justified in a\nmost substantial manner.  In order to make the most effective\ndemonstration of the powers and capabilities of my steam hammer,\nI constructed one of 30cwt.  of hammer block, with a clear four feet\nrange of fall.  I soon had it set to work; and its energetic services\nhelped us greatly in our smith and forge work.  It was admired by all\nobservers.  People came from a distance to see it.  Mechanics and\nironfounders wondered at the new power which had been born.\nThe precision and beauty of its action seemed marvellous.\nThe attendant could, by means of the steam slide-valve lever in his\nhand, transmit his will to the action of the hammer, and thus think in\nblows.  The machine combined great power with gentleness.  The hammer\ncould be made to give so gentle a blow as to crack the end of an egg\nplaced in a wine glass on the anvil; whilst the next blow would shake\nthe parish or be instantly arrested in its descent midway.*\n [footnote...\nThis is no mere figure of speech.  I have heard the tea-cups rattle in\nthe cupboard in my house a quarter of a mile from the place where the\nhammer was at work.  I was afterwards informed that the blows of my\ngreat steam hammer at Woolwich Arsenal were sensibly felt at Greenwich\nObservatory, about two miles distant.\n ...]\n\nHand-gear was the original system introduced in working the hammer.\nA method of self-acting was afterwards added.  In 1843, I admitted\nsteam above the piston, to aid gravitation.  This was an important\nimprovement.  The self-acting arrangement was eventually done away\nwith, and hand-gear again became all but universal.  Sir John Anderson,\nin his admirable Report on the Vienna Exhibition of 1873, says:\nThe most remarkable features of the Nasmyth hammers were the almost\nentire abandonment of the old self-acting motion of the early hammers\nand the substitution of new devices, and in the use of hand-gear only\nin all attempts to show off the working.  There is no real saving,\nas a general rule, by the self-acting arrangement, because one\nattendant is required in either case, and on the other hand there is\nfrequently a positive loss in the effect of the blow. By hand-working,\nwith steam on top of piston, the full force can be more readily\nmaintained until the blow is fully delivered; it is thus more of a dead\nblow than was formerly the case with the other system.\"\n\nThere was no want of orders when the valuable qualities of the steam\nhammer came to be seen and experienced.  The first Order came from\nRushton and Eckersley of Bolton, who, by the way, had seen the first\ncopy of my original design a few years before.  The steam hammer I made\nfor them was more powerful than my own.  The hammer block was of five\ntons weight, and had a clear fall of five feet.  It gave every\nsatisfaction, and the fame of its performances went abroad amongst the\nironworkers.  The Lowmoor Ironworks Company followed suit with an order\nfor one of the same size and power; and another came from Hawkes and Co.,\nof Newcastle-upon-Tyne.\n\nOne of the most important uses of the steam hammer was in forging\nanchors.  Under the old system, anchors upon the soundness of which the\nsafety of ships so often depends--were forged upon the \"bit by bit\"\nsystem.  The various pieces of an anchor were welded together,\nbut at the parts where the different pieces of iron were welded\ntogether, flaws often occurred; the parts would break off--blades\nfrom the stock, or flukes from the blades--and leave the vessel,\nwhich relied upon the security of its anchor, at the risk of the winds\nand the waves.  By means of the steam hammer these risks were averted.\nThe slag was driven out during the hammering process.  The anchor was\nsound throughout because it was welded as a whole.\n\nThose who are technically acquainted with smith work as it used to be\npractised, by what I term the \"bit by bit\" system--that is,\nof building up from many separate parts of iron, afterwards welded\ntogether into the required form--can appreciate the vast practical\nvalue of the Die method brought into general use by the controllable\nbut immense power of the steam hammer.  At a very early period of my\nemployment of the steam hammer, I introduced the system of stamping\nmasses of welding hot iron as if it had been clay, and forcing it into\nsuitable moulds or dies placed upon the anvil.  This practice had been\nin use on a small scale in the Birmingham gun trade, The ironwork of\nfirearms was thus stamped into exact form.  But, until we possessed the\nwide range and perfectly controllable powers of the steam hammer,\nthe stamping system was confined to comparatively small portions of\nforge work.  The new power enabled the die and stamp system to be\napplied to the largest class of forge work; and another era in the\nworking of ponderous masses of smith and forge work commenced, and has\nrapidly extended until the present time.  Without entering into further\ndetails, the steam hammer has advanced the mechanical arts, especially\nwith relation to machinery of the larger class, to an extent that is of\nincalculable importance.\n\nSoon after my steam hammer had exhibited its merits as a powerful and\ndocile agent in percussive force, and shown its applicability to some\nof the most important branches of iron manufacture, I had the\nopportunity of securing a patent for it in the United States.\nThis was through the kind agency of my excellent friend and solicitor,\nthe late George Humphries of Manchester.  Mr. Humphries was a native of\nPhiladelphia, and the intimate friend of Samuel Vaughan Merrick,\nfounder of the eminent engineering firm of that city.  Through his\ninstrumentality I forwarded to Mr. Merrick all the requisite documents\nto enable a patent to be secured at the United States Patent Office at\nWashington.  I transferred the patent to Mr. Merrick in order that it\nmight be worked to our mutual advantage.  My invention was thus\nintroduced into America under the most favourable auspices.\nThe steam hammer soon found its way into the principal ironworks of the\ncountry.  The admirable straightforward manner in which our American\nagent conducted the business from first to last will ever command my\ngrateful remembrance.\n\n\nCHAPTER 14.  Travels in France and Italy.\n\nI have already referred to my visit to Creuzot, in France.\nI must explain how it was that I was induced to travel abroad.\nThe French Government had ordered from our firm some powerful machine\ntools, which were manufactured, delivered, and found to give every\nsatisfaction.  Shortly after, I received a letter from M. Bouchier,\nthe Minister of Marine, inviting me to make a personal visit to the\nFrench naval arsenals for the purpose of conferring with the directing\nofficials as to the mechanical equipments of their respective\nworkshops.\n\nI accordingly proceeded to Paris, and was received most cordially by\nthe Minister of Marine.  After conferring with him, I was furnished\nwith letters of introduction to the directing officers at Cherbourg,\nBrest, Rochefort, Indret, and Toulon.  While in Paris I visited some\nof the principal manufacturing establishments, the proprietors of\nwhich had done business with our firm.  I also visited Arago at the\nObservatory, and saw his fine array of astronomical instruments.\nThe magnificent collections of antiquities at the Louvre and Hotel\nCluny occupied two days out of the four I spent in Paris; after which\nI proceeded on my mission.  Rouen lay in my way, and I could not fail\nto stay there and indulge my love for Gothic architecture.\nI visited the magnificent Cathedral and the Church of St. Ouen,\nso exquisite in its beauty, together with the refined Gothic\narchitectural remains scattered about in that interesting and\npicturesque city.  I was delighted beyond measure with all that I saw.\nWith an eye to business, however, I paid a visit to the works which had\nbeen established by the late Joseph Locke in the neighbourhood of Rouen\nfor the supply of locomotives to the Havre, Rouen, and Paris Railway.\nThe works were then under the direction of Mr. Buddicom.\nI went onward through Caen to Bayeux.  There I rested for a few hours\nfor the purpose of visiting the superb Norman Cathedral, and also to\ninspect the celebrated Bayeux tapestry.  I saw the needlework of Queen\nMatilda and her handmaidens, which so graphically commemorates the\nhistory of the Norman Conquest.  In the evening I reached Cherbourg.\nI was cordially received by the directing officer of the dockyard,\nwhich is of very large extent and surrounded by fortifications.\nMy business was with the smithy or atelier des forges,\nand the workshops or ateliers des machiness.  There I recognised many\nof the machine-tools manufactured at the Bridgewater Foundry, doing\nexcellent work.\n\nMy next visit was to Brest, the chief naval arsenal of France.\nIt combines a dockyard, arsenal, and fortress of the first class.\nEverything has been done to make the place impregnable.  The harbour is\nsituated on the north side of one of the finest havens in the world,\nand is almost land-locked.  Around the harbour run quays of great\nextent, alongside of which the largest ships can lie--five artificial\nbasins being excavated out of the solid rock.  The whole of the harbour\nis defended by tier above tier of batteries.  Foreigners are not\npermitted to enter the dockyard without special permission; but as I\nwas armed with my letter of introduction from the Minister of Marine,\nI was admitted and cordially received, as at Cherbourg.  I went through\nthe Government foundry and steam-factory, for which I had supplied many\nof my machine tools.  I found the establishment to be the largest and\nmost complete that I had seen.  From Brest I went to Rochefort,\nan excellent naval arsenal, though much smaller than those at Cherbourg\nand Brest.  Next to Indret on the Loire.  Here is the large factory\nwhere marine engines are made for the royal steamers.\nThe works were superintended by M. Rosine, a most able man.*\n [footnote...\nThe only man I ever met, to whom I might compare Rosine, was my\nlamented friend Francis Humphries, engineer of the Great Western\nSteamship Company.  Both were men of the same type, though Rosine was\nseveral octaves-higher in the compass and vividness of his intellect.\n ...]\n\nI was so much pleased with him that I spent two days in his society.\nI have rarely met with a more perfect union of the sound practical\nmechanic, of strong common-sense, and yet with a vivid imagination,\nwhich threw a light upon every subject that he touched.\nIt was delightful to see the perfect manner in which he had arranged\nall the details of the engine factory under his superintendence,\nand to observe the pride which he took in the accuracy of the work\nturned out by his excellent machinery.  It was a treat to see the\nmagnificent and intricate iron castings produced there.\n\nAs M. Rosine spoke English fluently, we had discussions on a vast\nvariety of topics, not only relating to technical subjects, but on\nother matters relating to art and mechanical drawing.  He was one of\nthe few men I have met who had in perfection the happy accomplishment\nof sketching with true artistic spirit any object that he desired to\nbring before you.  His pencil far outstripped language in conveying\ndistinct ideas on constructive and material objects.  The time that I\nspent in the company of this most interesting man will ever remain\nvivid in my memory.  It grieved me greatly to hear of his premature\ndeath about two years after the date of my visit.  He must have been a\nsad loss to his deeply attached friends, as well as to the nation\nwhom he so faith fully served.\n\nOn my way to Toulon I passed through Bordeaux, and by Avignon to\nNismes.  At the latter city I was delighted with the sight of the\nexquisite Roman temple, the Maison Carree.  It is almost perfect.\nBut the most interesting of the Roman remains at Nismes is the\nmagnificent Amphitheatre.  In viewing this grand specimen of\narchitecture, as well as the old temples, cathedrals, and castles,\nI felt that we moderns are comparative pigmies.  Our architecture wants\nbreadth, grandeur, sublimity.\n\nIt appears to me that one of the chief causes of the inferiority and\ndefects of Modern Architecture is, that our designers are so anxious\nto display their taste in ornamentation.  They first design the\nexterior, and then fit into it the interior of their building.\nThe purpose of the building is thus regarded as a secondary\nconsideration.  In short, they utilise ornament instead of ornamenting\nutility--total inversion, as it appears to me, of the fundamental\nprinciple which ought to govern all classes of architectural structures.\nThis is, unfortunately, too evident in most of our public buildings.\nSee, for instance, our new Law Courts.\n\nOne thing I was especially struck with at Nismes--the ease with\nwhich some thousands of people might issue, without hindrance, from\nthe Amphitheatre.  The wedge-shaped passages radiate from the centre,\nand, widening outwards, would facilitate the egress of an immense\ncrowd.  Contrast this with the difficulty of getting out of any modern\ntheatre or church in case of alarm or fire.  Another thing is\nremarkable--the care with which the huge blocks of magnesian limestone*\n [footnote...\nI believe Dolomite is the proper geological term. This fine material\nabounds in this part of France, and has materially contributed to the\ndurability of the Roman mason work.\n ...]\nhave been selected.  Some of the stone slabs are eighteen feet long;\nthey roof over the corridors; yet they still retain the marks of the\nRoman chisel.  Every individual chip is as crisp as on the day on which\nit was made; even the delicate \"scribe\" marks, by which the mason some\n1900 years ago lined out his work on the blocks of stone he was about\nto chip into its required form, are still perfectly distinct.\n\nThis wonderfully durable stone is of the same material as that\nemployed by lithographers.  Though magnesian, it is of a different\nquality from that employed in building our Houses of Parliament.\nAs this was carefully selected, the latter was carelessly unselected.\nIt was quarried at random, in the most ignorant way; some of it proved\nlittle better than chalk; and though all sorts of nostrums have been\ntried, nothing will cure the radical defect.  This, however, is a wide\ndigression from my subject of the admirable mason work,\nand the wonderful skill and forethought employed in erecting that\nsuperb arena and the other Roman buildings at Nismes.\n\nI proceeded to Marseilles, where I had some business to transact with\nPhilip Taylor and Company, the engineering firm.  They were most kind\nand attentive to me while there, and greatly added to the enjoyment\nof my visit to that remarkable city.  From Marseilles I proceeded to\nToulon, the last of the marine dockyards I had to visit.  There was no\nrailway between the places at that time, and it was accordingly\nnecessary that I should drive along the usual road.  In the course of\nmy journey to Toulon I went through the Pass of Col d'Ollioulles.\nIt was awfully impressive.  The Pass appeared to consist of a mighty\ncleft between two mountains; the result of some convulsion of Nature.\nThere was only room for the carriage road to pass between the cliffs.\nThe ruins of a Saracenic castle stood on the heights to guard the\npassage.  It was certainly the most romantic scene I had ever beheld.\n\nLooking down into the deep cleft below me, at the bottom of which ran\na turbulent stream, I saw the narrow road along which our carriage\nwas to pass.  And then suddenly I emerged in full sight of the\nMediterranean, with the calm blue heavens resting over the deep blue\nsea.  There were palms, cactuses, and orange trees, mixed with olive\ngroves.  The fields were full of tulips and narcissuses, and the rocks\nby the roadside were covered with boxwood and lavender.  Everything\ngave evidence of the sunny South.  I had got a glimpse of the\nMediterranean a few days before; but now I saw it in its glory.\n\nI arrived in due time at Toulon.  The town is not very striking in\nitself.  It is surrounded by an amphitheatre of mountains of hard\nmagnesian limestone.  These are almost devoid of vegetation.\nThis it is which gives so arid an aspect to this part of the coast.\nFacing the south, the sun's rays, reflected from the bare surface of\nthe rocks, place one at mid-day as if in the focus of a great burning\nmirror, and send every one in quest of shade.  This intense temperature\nhas its due effect upon the workers in the dockyard.  I found the place\nfar inferior to the others which I had visited.  The heat seemed to\nengender a sort of listlessness over the entire place. The people\nseemed to be falling asleep.  Though we complain of cold in our\nnorthern hemisphere, it is a great incentive to work.  Even our east\nwind is an invigorator; it braces us up, and strengthens our nerves and\nmuscles.\n\nIt is quite possible that the workmen of the Toulon dockyard might fire\nup and work with energy provided an occasion arose to call forth their\ndormant energy.  But without the aid of an almost universal\nintroduction of self-acting tools in this sleepy establishment,\nto break, with the busy hum of active working machinery, the spell of\nindolence that seemed to pervade it, there appeared to me no hope of\nanything like continuous and effective industry or useful results.\nThe docks looked like one vast knacker's yard of broken-down obsolete\nships and wretched old paraphernalia--unfortunately a characteristic\nof other establishments nearer home than Toulon.\n\nAfter transacting my business with the directing officers of this\nvast dockyard I returned to Marseilles.  There I found letters\nrequiring me to proceed to Naples, in order to complete some business\narrangements in that city.  I was exceedingly rejoiced to have an\nopportunity of visiting the south of Italy.  I set out at once.\nA fine new steamer of the Messageries Imperiales, the Ercolano, was\nready to sail from the harbour.  I took my place on board.\nI found that the engines had been made by Maudsley Sons and Field;\nthey were of their latest improved double-cylinder construction.\nWhen I went down into the engine-room I felt myself in a sense at home;\nfor the style of the engines brought to my mind many a pleasant\nremembrance of the days gone by.\n\nWe steamed out of the harbour, and passed in succession the beautiful\nlittle islands which gem the bay of Marseilles.  Amongst others,\nthe isle of If, crowned by its castle, once a State prison,\nand the Chateau d'If, immortalised by Dumas.  Then Pomegne, Ratoneau,\nand other islands.  We were now on the deep blue Mediterranean,\nwatching the graceful curves of the coast as we steamed along.\nSoon after, we came in sight of the snow-capped maritime Alps behind\nNice.  The evening was calm and clear, and a bright moon shone\noverhead.  Next morning I awoke in the harbour of Genoa, with a\nsplendid panoramic view of the city before me.  I shall never forget\nthe glorious sight of that clear bright morning as long as I live.\n\nAs the steamer was to remain in the harbour until two o'clock next\nday, I landed with the passengers and saw the wonders of the city.\nI felt as if I were in a new world.  On every side and all around me\nwere objects of art lighted up by glorious sunshine.  The picturesque\nnarrow streets, with the blue sky overhead and the bright sunshine\nlighting up the beautiful architecture of the palatial houses, relieved\nby masses of clear shade, together with the picturesque dresses of the\npeople, and the baskets of oranges and lemons with the leaves on the\nboughs on which they had been born and reared, the brilliant greenery\nof the inner courts into which you peeped while passing along the\nStrada Nuova, literally a street of palaces, threw me into a fervency\nof delight.  Here, indeed, was architecture to be proud of--grand,\nimposing, and massive--chastely yet gloriously ornamented.\nThere was nothing of the gingerbread order here!\n\nThe plan of these palaces is admirable.  They are open to the street,\nso that all the inner arrangements may be seen.  There is the court,\nsurrounded by arcades, the arches of which rest upon columns; the\nflights of marble steps on each side, leading to the great hall or\nthe principal apartments; and inside the court, the pink daphnes and\nTangerine orange frees, surrounded by greenery, with which the\nsplendour of the marble admirably contrasts;--the whole producing a\nmagnificent effect.  I remembered that Genoa la superba was one of my\nfather's pet subjects when talking of his first visit to Italy;\nand now I could confirm all that he had said about the splendour of its\npalaces.\n\nI do not know of anything more delightful than to grope one's way\nthrough a foreign city, especially such a city as Genoa, and come\nunexpectedly upon some building that one has heard of--that has\ndimly lived in the mind like a dream--and now to see it realised in\nfact.  It suddenly starts into life, as it were, surrounded by its\nnatural associations.  I hate your professional guides and their\nconstant chatter.  Much better to come with a mind prepared with some\nhistory to fall back upon, and thus be enabled to compare the present\nwith the past, the living with the dead.\n\nI climbed up some of the hills surrounding Genoa--for it is a city\nof ups and downs.  I wandered about the terraced palaces surrounded by\norange groves and surveyed the fortified heights by which the place\nis surrounded.  What exquisite bits of scenery there were to sketch;\nwhat a rich combination of nature and art!  And what a world of\ncolour, with the clear blue sea in the distance!  Altogether,\nthat one day at Genoa--though but a succession of glimpses formed a\nbright spot in my life, that neither time nor distance can dim or\ntarnish.\n\nI returned to the harbour two hours before the steamer was to leave.\nTo commemorate my visit, I mounted the top of the paddle-box, took out\nmy sketch book, and made a panoramic view of Genoa as seen from the\nharbour.  I did it in pencil at the time, and afterwards filled it up\nwith ink.  When the pages of the sketch book had been joined together\nthe panoramic view extended to about eight feet long.  The accuracy of\nthe detail, as well as the speed with which the drawing was done,\nwere perhaps rather creditable to the draughtsman--at least so my\nartistic friends were pleased to tell me.  Indeed, many years after,\na friend at court desired to submit it to the highest Lady in the land,\nand, being herself an artist, she expressed herself as highly gratified\nwith the performance.\n\n[Image]  A monk on board\n\nThe next station the steamer touched at was Leghorn.  As the vessel was\nnot to start until next day, there was sufficient time for me to run up\nto Pisa.  There I spent a delightful day principally in wandering about\nthat glorious group of buildings situated so near to each other--\nthe Cathedral, the Baptistery, the Campo Santo, and the Campanile or\nLeaning Tower.  What interested me most at the Cathedral was the two\nbronze lamps suspended at the end of the nave, which suggested to the\nmind of Galileo the invention of the pendulum. Thousands had seen the\nlamps swinging before them, but he alone would know \"the reason why.\"\nThe one swung at a different rate as compared with the other, being the\nresult of the chains being hung of different lengths.  Hence Galileo's\ndiscovery of the principle or Law of the Pendulum.  This paved the way\nfor Newton's law of gravitation--one of the grandest laws of the\nuniverse.\n\nSome of the finest works of Andrea del Sarto, son of the Tailor,\nare found here.  Indeed, the works of that great painter are little\nknown out of Pisa and Florence.  I was reluctant to tear myself away\nfrom Pisa; but the Ercolano could not wait, and I was back in good\ntime, and soon under weigh.\n\nThe next port we touched at was Civita Vecchia, one of the most dreary\nplaces that can be imagined, though at one time an Etruscan city,\nand afterwards the port of Trajan.  I did not land, as there were some\ndifficulties in the way of passports.  We steamed on; and next morning\nwhen I awoke we were passing the coast of Ischia.  We could scarcely\nsee the island for a thick mist had over-spread the sea. Naples was\nstill hidden from our sight, but over the mist I could observe the\nsummit of Vesuvius vomiting forth dense clouds of white smoke.\nThe black summit of the crater appeared floating in the clear blue sky.\nBut the heat of the sun shortly warmed the mist, and it floated away\nlike a curtain.\n\n[Image]  Distant view of Vesuvius\n\nA grand panorama then lay before us.  Naples looked bright and\nmagnificent under the sunlight.  The sea was so smooth that the\nbuildings and towers and convents and spires were reflected in the\nwater.  On our left lay the Bay of Baiae, with its castles and temples\nand baths, dating from the days of the Roman Republic.  To the right\nlay Castellamare, Sorrento, and the island of Capri.  But the most\nprominent object was Vesuvius in front, with its expanding cloud of\nwhite smoke over the landscape.  On landing, I took up my quarters at\nthe Hotel Victoria.  I sallied forth to take my first hasty view of the\nChiaia, the streets, and the principal buildings.  But, in accordance\nwith my motto of \"Duty first, pleasure second,\" I proceeded to attend\nto the business respecting which I had visited Naples.  That, however,\nwas soon disposed of.  In a few days I was able to attend to pleasure.\nI made my way to the Museo Borbonico, now called the National Museum.\nI found it a rich mine of precious treasures, consisting of Greek,\nEtruscan, and Roman antiquities of every description.\nNot the least interesting part of the Museum is the collection of marbles,\npictures, and articles of daily use, dug from the ruins of the buried\ncity of Pompeii.  Every spare hour that I could command was occupied in\nvisiting and revisiting this wonderful Museum.\n\nHerculaneum and Pompeii were also visited, but, more than all,\nthe crater of Vesuvius.  During my visit the mountain was in its normal\nstate.  I mounted the volcanic ashes with which it is strewn,\nand got to the top.  There I could look down into the pit from which\nthe clouds of steam are vomited forth.  I went down to the very edge of\nthe crater, stood close to its mouth, and watched the intermittent\nup-rushing of the blasts of vapour and sulphureous gases.\nTo keep clear of these I stood to the windward side, and was thus out\nof harm's way.\n\nWhat struck me most was the wonderfully brilliant colours of the rugged\nlava rocks forming the precipitous cliffs of the interior walls of the\ncrater.  These brilliant colours were the result of the sublimation and\ncondensation on their surfaces of the combinations of sulphur and\nchloride of iron, quite as bright as if they had been painted with\nbright red, chrome, and all the most brilliant tints. Columns of all\nmanner of chemical vapours ascended from the clefts and deep cracks,\nat the bottom of which I clearly saw the bright hot lava.\n\nI rolled as big a mass of cool lava as I could to the edge of the\ncrater and heaved it down; but I heard no sound.  Doubtless the depth\nwas vast, or it might probably have fallen into the molten lava,\nand thus made no noise.  On leaving this horrible pit edge, I tied the\ncard of the Bridgewater Foundry to a bit of lava and threw it in,\nas token of respectful civility to Vulcan, the head of our craft.\n\nI had considerably more difficulty in clambering up to the top edge\nof the crater than I had in coming down.  Once or twice, indeed,\nI was half choked by the swirls of sulphureous and muriatic acid vapour\nthat environed me before I could reach the upper edge.  I sat down in a\nnook, though it was a very hot one, and made a sketch or two of the\nappearance of the crater.  But I feel that it is quite beyond my power\neither by pen or pencil, to convey an idea of the weird unearthly\naspect which the funnel-shaped crater of Vesuvius presented at that\ntime.  An eruption of unusual violence had occurred shortly before I\nsaw it.  Great rounded blocks of lava had been thrown high into the air\nagain and again, and had fallen back into the terrible focus of\nvolcanic violence.  Vast portions of the rugged and precipitous sides\nof the crater had fallen in, and were left in a state of the wildest\nconfusion.  When I visited the place the eruption had comparatively\nsubsided.  The throat of the crater was a rugged opening of more than\nforty feet diameter, leading down to--Where?  Echo answers, \"Where?\"\nAnd yet there is no doubt but that the great mass of materials which\nlay around me as I made my sketches, had been shot up from\ninconceivable depths beneath the solid crust of the earth.\nThere still remains an enormous mass of molten materials that has been\nshut up beneath that crust since the surface of the globe assumed its\npresent condition.  The mineral matter that formed the globe had\nconverged towards its centre of gravity, and the arrestment of the\nmomentum of the coalescing particles resulted in intense heat.\nHence the molten condition of the globe in its primitive state.\nThe molten lava of volcanoes is the survival of that original cosmical\nheat.\n\nThis heat has played a great part in the physical history of the globe.\nVolcanic action has been, as it were, the universal plough!\nIt has given us mountains, hills, and valleys.  It has given us\npicturesque scenery, gorges, precipices, waterfalls.  The up heaving\nagent has displayed the mineral treasures of the earth, and enabled man,\nby intelligent industry, to use them as mines of material blessings.\nThis is indeed a great and sublime subject.\n\nI had remained near the mouth of the crater for about five hours.\nEvening was approaching.  My drawings were finished, and I prepared to\nleave.  My descent from the summit of the crater edge was comparatively\nrapid, though every footstep went down some fifteen inches through the\nvolcanic ashes.  I descended by the eastern side, and was soon at the\nbase of the great cone.  I made my way by tortuous walking round the\nerupted masses of lava, and also by portions of the lava streams,\nwhich, on losing their original fluidity, had become piled up and\ncontorted into gigantic masses.\n\nAt the extreme edges of the flow, where the lava had become viscid,\nthese folds and contortions were very remarkable.  They were piled fold\nover fold,--the result of the mighty pressure from behind.\nIt was sad to see so many olive gardens burnt and destroyed;\nthe trees were as black as charcoal.  It is singular to see the numbers\nof orange and olive growers who choose to live so near to the\n\"fiery element.\"  But the heat presses forward the growth of vegetation.\nTo be there is like living in a hothouse; and the soil is\nextraordinarily fertile.  Hence the number of vineyards quite close to\nthe base of Vesuvius.  The cultivators endeavour to enclose their\ngardens with hard masses of lava, so as to turn off the flow of the\nmolten streams in other directions; but the lava bursts through the\nwalls again and again, and the gardens are often utterly burnt up and\nruined.  Almost every field at the base of Vesuvius contains a neat\nlittle oratory, with a statue of the Virgin and Child, to which the\ncultivators repair in times of peril and calamity.  But chapel, statue,\nand gardens are alike swept away by the tremendous descent of the\nmolten lava.\n\nAs the night was growing dark, I made my way from these riskful farms\nto Rosina, a little village on the way back to Naples.  As I had had\nnothing to eat or drink during this thirst-producing journey, I went\ninto a wine shop and asked for some refreshment.  The wine shop was a\nsort of vault, with a door like that of a coach-house, but with a bench\nand narrow table.  The good woman brought me a great green glass bottle\nlike a vitriol carboy!  It contained more than six gallons of wine,\nand she left me with a big glass to satisfy my wants.  The wine was the\nveritable Lachryma, Christi--a delightful light claret--for\nproducing which the vineyards at the base of Vesuvius are famous.\nAfter some most glorious swigs from this generous and jovial carboy,\naccompanied with some delightful fresh made bread, I felt myself up to\nanything.  After washing down the dust that I had swallowed during the\nday, I settled with my liberal landlady (indeed she was mightily\npleased with only tenpence), and started for Naples.\n\nI had still an eight-mile walk before me, but that was nothing to my\nvigorous powers at that time.  The moon had risen during my stay in\nthe wine house, and it shone with a bright clear light.  After a few\nmiles' walking I felt a little tired, for the day's exercise had been\nrather toilsome.  A fine carriage passed me on the road with a most\ntempting platform behind.  I hailed the driver, and was allowed to\nmount.  I was soon bowling along the lava paved road, and in a short\ntime I arrived at Naples.  I made another excursion to the crater of\nVesuvius before I left, as well as visits to Herculaneum and Pompeii,\nwhich exceedingly interested me.  But these I need not attempt to\nrelate.  I refer my readers to Murray's Guide Book, where both are\nadmirably described.\n\nAfter completing my business affairs at Naples, and sowing the seeds\nof several orders, which afterwards bore substantial results,\nI left the city by the same line of steamers.  I passed again Civita\nVecchia, Leghorn, Genoa, and Marseilles.  On passing through the South\nof France I visited the works of several of our employers, and carried\nback with me many orders.  It was when at Creuzot that I saw the child\nof my brain, the steam hammer, in full and efficient work.\nBut this I have referred to in a previous chapter.\n\n\nCHAPTER 15.  Steam Hammer Pile-driver.\n\nIn 1840 I furnished Sir Edward Parry with a drawing of my steam hammer,\nin the hope that I might induce him to recommend its adoption in the\nRoyal Dockyards.  Sir Edward was at that time the head director of the\nsteam marine of England.  That was after the celebrity he had acquired\nthrough his Arctic voyages.  I was of opinion that the hammer might\nprove exceedingly useful in forging anchors and large iron work in\nthose great establishments.  Sir Edward appeared to be much struck with\nthe simplicity and probable efficiency of the invention.\nBut the Admiralty Board were very averse to introducing new methods of\nmanufacturing into the dockyards.  Accordingly, my interview with\nSir Edward Parry, notwithstanding his good opinion, proved fruitless.\n\nTime passed by.  I had furnished steam hammers to the principal\nfoundries in England.  I had sent them abroad, even to Russia.\nAt length it became known to the Lords of the Admiralty that a new\npower in forging had been introduced.  This was in 1843, three years\nafter I had submitted my design to Sir Edward Parry.  The result was\nthat my Lords appointed a deputation of intelligent officers to visit\nmy foundry at Patricroft to see the new invention.  It consisted of\nCaptain Benison (brother of the late Speaker), and Captain Burgman,\nResident Engineer at Devonport Dockyard.  They were well able to\nunderstand the powerful agency of the steam hammer for marine forge\nwork.  I gave them every opportunity for observing its action.\nThey were much pleased, and I may add astonished, at its range, power,\nand docility.\n\nBesides showing them my own steam hammer, I took the deputation to the\nextensive works of Messrs.  Rushton and Eckersley, where they saw one\nof my five-ton hammer-block steam hammers in full action.\nIt was hammering out some wrought-iron forgings of the largest class,\nas well as working upon smaller forgings.  By exhibiting the wide range\nof power of the steam hammer, these gentlemen were entirely satisfied\nof its fitness for all classes of forgings for the naval service.\nThey reported to the Admiralty accordingly, and in a few days we\nreceived an official letter, with an order for a steam hammer having\na 50 cwt.  hammer-block, together with the appropriate boiler,\ncrane, and forge furnace, so as to equip a complete forge shop at\nDevonport Dockyard.  This was my first order from the Government for\na steam hammer.\n\nWhen everything was ready, I set out for Devonport to see the hammer\nand the other portions of the machinery carefully erected.\nIn about a fortnight it was ready for its first stroke.  As good luck\nwould have it, the Lords of the Admiralty were making their annual\nvisit of inspection to the dockyard that day.  They arrived too late in\nthe afternoon for a general inspection of the establishment; but they\nasked the superintending admiral if there was anything of importance\nwhich they might see before the day closed.  The admiral told them that\nthe most interesting novelty in the dockyard was the starting of\nNasmyth's steam hammer.  \"Very well, they said, \"let us go and see that\".\n\nI was there, with the two mechanics I had brought with me from\nPatricroft to erect the steam hammer.  I took share and share alike in\nthe work.  The Lords were introduced to me, and I proceeded to show\nthem the hammer.  I passed it through its paces.  I made it break an\neggshell in a wine-glass without injuring the glass.  It was as neatly\neffected by the two-and-a-half ton hammer as if it had been done by an\negg-spoon.  Then I had a great mass of white-hot iron swung out of the\nfurnace by a crane and placed upon the anvil block.  Down came the\nhammer on it with ponderous blows.  My Lords scattered to the\nextremities of the workshop, for the splashes and sparks of hot metal\nflew about.  I went on with the hurtling blows of the hammer,\nand kneaded the mass of iron as if it had been clay into its devised\nforms.\n\nAfter finishing off the forging, my Lords gathered round the hammer\nagain, when I explained to them the rationale of its working,\nand the details of its construction.  They were greatly interested,\nespecially Mr. Sidney Herbert (afterwards Lord Herbert of Lea),\nthen Secretary to the Admiralty, and Sir George Cockburn,\na fine specimen of the old admiral.  Indeed, all the members of the\nBoard were more or less remarkable men.  They honoured me with their\ncareful attention, and expressed their admiration at the hammer's\nwonderful range of power and delicacy of touch, in this new application\nof the force of steam.\n\nThe afternoon was a most important one for me in more ways than one,\nalthough I cannot venture to trouble my readers with the details.\nIt was followed, however, by an order to supply all the Royal Dockyard\nforge departments with a complete equipment of steam hammers,\nand all the requisite accessories.  These were supplied in due time,\nand gave in every case the highest satisfaction.  The forgings were\nfound to be greatly better, and almost absurdly cheaper than those done\nby the old bit by bit building-up process.  The danger of flaws was\nentirely done away with; and, in the case of anchors, this was a\nconsideration of life and death to the seamen, who depend for their\nsafety upon the soundness of the forgings.\n\nBesides my introduction to that admirable man, Mr. Sidney Herbert,\nI had the happiness of being introduced to Captain Brandreth,\nDirector of Naval Works.  The whole of the buildings on shore,\nincluding the dockyards, were under his control.  One of the most\nimportant affairs that the Lords of the Admiralty had to attend to on\ntheir visit to Devonport was to conclude the contract for constructing\nthe great docks at Keyham.  This was a large extension of the Devonport\nDocks, intended for the accommodation of the great steamships of the\nRoyal Navy, as well as for an increase of the graving docks and\nworkshops for their repair.  An immense portion of the shore of the\nHamoaze had to be walled in so as to exclude the tide and enable the\nspace to be utilised for the above purposes.  To effect this a vast\namount of pile-driving was rendered necessary, in order to form a firm\nfoundation for the great outer dock wall, about a mile and a quarter in\nlength.\n\nMessrs. Baker and Sons were the contractors for this work.\nThey were present at the first start of my steam hammer at Devonport.\nThey were, like the others, much impressed by its vast power and\nmanageableness.  They had an interview with me as to its applicability\nfor driving piles for the immense dock, this being an important part of\ntheir contract.  Happily, I had already given some attention to this\napplication of the powers of the steam hammer.  In fact, I had secured\na patent for it.  I had the drawings for the steam hammer pile-driving\nmachine with me.  I submitted them to Mr. Baker, and he saw its\nimportance in a moment.  \"That,\" he 'said, \"is the very thing that I\nwant to enable me to complete my contract satisfactorily.\"  Thousands of\nenormous piles had to be driven down into the deep silt of the Shore;\nand to have driven them down by the old system of pile-driving would\nhave occupied a long time, and would also have been very expensive.\n\nThe drawings were of course submitted to Captain Brandreth.\nHe was delighted with my design.  The steam pile-driver would be,\nin his opinion, the prime agent for effecting the commencement of the\ngreat work originated by himself.  At first the feat of damming out\nsuch a high tide as that of the Hamoaze seemed very doubtful, because\nthe stiff slate silt was a treacherous and difficult material to\npenetrate.  But now, he thought, the driving would be rendered\ncomparatively easy.  With Captain Brandreth's consent the contractors\nordered of me two of my steam hammer pile-drivers.  They were to be\ncapable of driving 18-inch square piles of 70 feet in length into the\nsilt of the Hamoaze.\n\n[Image]  Space to be enclosed at the Hamoaze\n\nThis first order for my pile-driver was a source of great pleasure to me.\nI had long contemplated this application of the power of the steam\nhammer.  The machine had long been in full action in my \"mind's eye,\"\nand now I was to see it in actual reality.  I wrote down to my partner\nby that night's post informing him of the happy circumstance. The order\nwas for two grand steam hammer pile-drivers, each with four-ton\nhammer-blocks.The wrought-iron guide case and the steam cylinder were\nto weigh in all seven tons.  All this weight was to rest on the\nshoulders of the pile.  The blows were to be about eighty in the\nminute.  This, I thought, would prove thoroughly effective in rapidly\ndriving the piles down into the earth.\n\nI have said that the steam pile-driver was in my mind's eye long before\nI saw it in action.  It is one of the most delightful results of the\npossession of the constructive faculty, that one can build up in the\nmind mechanical structures and set them to work in imagination, and\nobserve beforehand the various details performing their respective\nfunctions, as if they were in absolute material form and action.\nUnless this happy faculty exists ab initio in the brain of the\nmechanical engineer, he will have a hard and disappointing life before\nhim.  It is the early cultivation of the imagination which gives the\nright flexibility to the thinking faculties.  Thus business, commerce,\nand mechanics are all the better for a little healthy imagination.\n\nSo soon as I had returned home, I set to work and prepared the working\ndrawings of the steam pile-drivers.  They were soon completed, conveyed\nto Devonport, and erected on the spot where they were to be used.\nThey were ready on the 3d of July 1845.  Some preliminary pile-driving\nhad been done in the usual way, in order to make a stage or elevated\nway for my pile-driver to travel along the space where the permanent\npiles were to be driven.  I arranged my machines so that they might\ntravel by their own locomotive powers along the whole length of the\ncoffer dam, and also that they should hoist up the great logs of Baltic\ntimber which formed the Piles into their proper places before being\ndriven.\n\nThe entire apparatus of the machine was erected on a strong timber\nplatform, and was placed on wheels, so that it might move along the\nrails laid down upon the timber way.  The same boiler that supplied the\nsteam hammer part of the apparatus served to work the small steam-engine\nfixed to the platform for its locomotion, and also to perform the duty\nof rearing the next pile which had to be driven.  The steam was\nconveyed to the hammer cylinder by the jointed pipe seen in the annexed\nengraving.  The pipe accommodated itself to any elevation or descent of\nthe hammer.  The whole weight of the cylinder, hammer-block, and guide\nbox, supported by the shoulders of the pile, amounting to seven tons in\nall, rested upon the shoulders of the pile as a \"persuader;\" and the\neighty blows per minute of the four-ton hammer came down with\ntremendous energy upon the top of the pile head.  No soil, that piles\ncould penetrate, could resist such effective agencies.\n\n[Image]  Diagram of the Steam Pile-Driver\n\nExplanation of the Diagram of the Steam Pile-Driver.--The chief\nfeature of novelty of this pile-driving machine consists in the\nemployment of the direct action of the Steam Hammer as the blow giving\nagent, and also in the manner in which the dead weight of the entire\napparatus, consisting of the hammer-block C, the steam cylinder A,\nand its guide-case B, is employed to importantly aid the effect of the\nrapid and energetic blows of the steam hammer.  These ponderous parts\nrest on the shoulders of the pile H all the while it is being driven,\nthe pile in this respect being the only support of the apparatus A B C.\nSo that, besides the eighty blows per minute that the four-ton steam\nhammer energetically deals out to the head of the pile from a four foot\nfall the dead weight of the apparatus constantly acts as a most\neffective \"predisposer\" to the sinking of the pile into the ground; the\nhoisting chain D being let slack the while, so as to allow A B C to\n\"follow down\" the pile H, while the eighty blows per minute are\nincessantly showered on its head.  The upward stroke of the piston,\nwith its attached hammer-block C, is arrested at the proper height not\nonly by allowing the steam that raised it to escape, but as soon as the\npiston passes the escape holes X X, the confined air above the piston\nat O rebounds, and so aids most effectively in increasing the energy of\nthe fall of the hammer-block C on the pile head.\n\nThere was a great deal of curiosity in the dockyard as to the action of\nthe new machine.  The pile-driving machine-men gave me a good-natured\nchallenge to vie with them in driving down a pile.  They adopted the\nold method, while I adopted the new one.  The resident managers sought\nout two great pile logs of equal size and length--70 feet long and\n18 inches square.  At a given signal we started together.\nI let in the steam, and the hammer at once began to work. The four-ton\nblock showered down blows at the rate of eighty a minute;\nand in the course of four and a half minutes my pile was driven down to\nthe required depth.  The men working at the ordinary machine had only\nbegun to drive.  It took them upwards of twelve hours to complete the\ndriving of their pile!\n\nSuch a saving of time in the performance of similar work--by steam\nversus  manual labour--had never before been witnessed.\nThe energetic action of the steam hammer, sitting on the shoulders of\nthe pile high up aloft, and following it suddenly down, the rapidly\nhammered blows keeping time with the flashing out of \"the waste steam\nat the end of each stroke, was indeed a remarkable sight.  When my pile\nwas driven, the hammer-block and guide case were speedily re-hoisted by\nthe small engine that did all the labouring and locomotive work of the\nmachine; the steam hammer portion of which was then lowered on to the\nshoulders of the next pile in succession. Again it set to work.\nAt this the spectators crowding about in boats, pronounced their\napproval in the usual British style of \"three cheers!\"\nMy new pile-driver was thus acknowledged as another triumphant proof of\nthe power of steam.\n\nThe whole of the piles for this great work were speedily driven in.\nThe wall was constructed, and the docks were completed in an unusually\nshort time.  The success of my pile-driver was followed by numerous\norders.  It was used for driving the immense piles required for the\nHigh Level Bridge at Newcastle, the great Border Bridge at\nBerwick-upon-tweed, the Docks at Tynemouth, the Docks at Birkenhead,\nthe Docks at Grimsby, the new Westminster Bridge, the great bridge at\nKief in Russia, the bridge at Petersburg, the forts at Cronstadt,\nthe Embarrage of the Nile, at Yokohama in Japan, and at other places.\nIt enabled a solid foundation to be laid for the enormous\nsuperstructures erected over them, and thus contributed to the\npermanence of many important undertakings.\n\nThe mechanical principles on which the efficiency of the steam\npile-driver chiefly depends are as simple as I believe they are\nentirely novel and original.  The shoulder of the pile acts as the sole\nsupporter of the ponderous mass of the hammer-block, cylinder,\nand guide-box.  This heavy weight acts as a predisposing agency to\nforce the pile down, while the momentum given by the repeated fall of\nthe hammer, at eighty blows the minute, brings the constant dead weight\ninto full action.  I am not aware of any other machine in which such a\ncombination of mechanical forces is employed.\n\nAnother very effective detail consisted in employing the waste steam in\nthe upper part of the cylinder for the purpose of acting as a buffer to\nresist any undue length of the upward stroke of the piston.\nBut for this the cylinder covers might have been knocked off.\nThe elastic buffer of waste steam also acted as a help to the downward\nblow of the hammer-block.  The simplicity and effectiveness of these\narrangements form--if I may be allowed to say so--a happy\nillustration of my \"Definition of Engineering,\" the application of\ncommon sense in the use of materials.\n\nThe folding-up steam pipe with which the steam was conveyed from the\nboiler to the cylinder at all heights, and the way in which the folding\njoints accommodated themselves to the varying height of the cylinder,\nwas another of my happy thoughts.  In fact, this invention, like most\nothers, was the result of a succession of happy thoughts.\nThe machine in its entirety was the result of a number of common-sense\ncontrivances, such as I generally delight in.  At all events, this most\neffective and novel machine was a special favourite with me.\n\nI may mention, before concluding this branch of my subject,\nthat pile-driving had before been conducted on what I might term the\nartillery or cannon-ball principle.  A small mass of iron was drawn\nslowly up, and suddenly let down on the head of the pile at a high\nvelocity.  This was destructive, not impulsive action.  Sometimes the\npile was shivered into splinters, without driving it into the soil;\nin many cases the head of the pile was shattered into matches, and this\nin spite of a hoop of iron about it to keep the layers of wood\ntogether.  Yet the whole was soon beat into a sort of brush.\nIndeed, a great portion of the men's time was consumed in \"reheading\"\nthe piles.  On the contrary, I employed great mass and moderate\nvelocity. The fall of the steam hammer-block was only three or four\nfeet, but it went on at eighty blows the minute, and the soil into\nwhich the pile was driven never had time to grip or thrust it up--\nan impediment well known to ordinary pile-drivers.  At the end of the\ndriving by my steam hammer, the top of the pile was always found neat\nand smooth, indeed more so than when the driving began.\n\nI may again revert to my interview with the Lords of the Admiralty on\nthe occasion of my first meeting them at Devonport.  I was residing at\nthe hotel where they usually took up their quarters while making their\nannual visitation of the dockyard.  I was honoured with an invitation\nto confer with Sir George Cockburn, Mr. Sidney Herbert, and Captain\nBrandreth on a subject of considerable importance; namely, the proving\nof chain cables and anchors required for the Royal Navy.  The question\nwas mooted as to whether or not some permanent injury was done to both\nby the test strains to which they were submitted before being put on\nboard ship.  This was a subject of vital importance.  The members of\nthe Board requested me to act as one of a committee to inquire into the\nsubject.  I felt much gratified by the invitation and gladly accepted\nit.\n\nOn discussing the subject with these gentlemen that evening, I found\nthat Sir George Cockburn entertained an ingenious theory in support of\nhis apprehensions as the effect of \"over-proof\" straining of cables and\nanchors.  It was that they were originally in the condition of a strong\nman who had to lift some heavy weight, requiring him to exert his\nmuscular strength to the utmost; and, although he might perform the\nfeat, it was at the cost of a permanent injury, and that he might never\nbe able to lift the same weight again.  This, however true it might be\nwith regard to flesh and bone structures, was scarcely true with\nrespect to mechanical agencies.  I proposed a simple experiment with\nchain cables, which, it occurred to me, would show quite a different\nresult--namely, that the capability of resisting the severest\nproof-strain would rise rather than fall at each successive proof of\nthe same chain cable.\n\nTo test the correctness of my supposition, we had a first-class chain\ncable put into the proof machine,and subjected it to such a strain as\nto break it again and again, until at last it was divided almost into\nsingle links.  As I expected, the proof or breaking strain kept rising\nand rising as each successive remaining portion of the cable was torn\nasunder, thus showing that no injury to the natural tenacity of the\nchain had resulted from the increased proofs to which it had been\nsubjected, and that the last broken links had been much more resisting\nthan the first.  The same class of demonstrative experiments was made\nwith anchors, and other wrought-iron work used in the service.\nThe Admiralty officers were much gratified with the result, as removing\na groundless but very natural apprehension, heightened, no doubt,\nby the suggestions that had been made to the Admiralty, that their\nstandard proof strain was not only too high in itself, but produced\npermanent damage to what at the outset was of the toughest iron.\nMy system of continued proof-straining was, in fact, another\nexemplification of the \"Survival of the Fittest\"!\n\nA very interesting truth came out in the course of our experiments.\nIt was that the chief cause of failure in the links of chain cables\narose, not so much from their want of tenacity, or from the quality of\nthe iron, but from some defective welding in the making of the links.\nTo get at this truth, many excellent cables as received from the\ncontractors, as well as veteran ones that had held great ships riding\nat anchor in terrible gales, were pulled asunder link by link by an\nintentional destructive strain by the proving machine.\nAn exact account was taken of the nature of the fracture of each.\nThe result was that in eight cases out of ten, the fracture was found\nto result from a defectively welded part of the chain-link.\nThe practically trained eye could see the scoria which indicates the\ndefective welding.  Though long unseen, it was betrayed at once when\nthe link was torn open by the proof strain.\n\nMy services on this committee proved a source of great enjoyment to me.\nI had frequent occasion to visit the dockyards and workshops,\naccompanied by Captain Brandreth, surveyor-general of the Admiralty\nlandworks,Mr. Thomas Lloyd, engineer-in-chief of the Admiralty, and\nMr. Jeremiah Owen, chief of the metal material required in the\nequipment of the navy I was requested to suggest any improvement in the\nworkshops that I thought would add to the efficiency of the department;\nand I trust that my recommendations proved of practical good to the\nservice.  At the same time, I have reason to know that many of the\nrecommendations of the committee, though cordially acknowledged by the\nhigher powers, were by a sort of passive resistance practically\nshelved.\n\nI was much amused, when I first went to Devonport dockyard, to notice\nthe punctilious observance of forms and ceremonies with respect to the\nvarious positions of officials--from the admiral-superintendent down\nthe official grades of dignity, to the foremen of departments,\nand so on.  I did not care for all this panjandrum of punctiliousness,\nbut was, I hope, civil and chatty with everybody.  I had a good word\nfor the man as well as for the foreman.  I received some kind and\ngood-natured hints as to the relative official superiority that\nprevailed in the departments, and made out a scale or list of the\nvarious strata accordingly.  This gamut of eminence was of use to me in\nmy dealings with dockyard officials.  I was enabled to mind my p's and\nq's in communicating with them.\n\nThe first Sunday that I spent at Devonport I went to the dockyard\nchurch--the church appointed for officials and men employed by the\nGovernment.  The seats were appointed in the order of rank,\nemployments, and rate of pay.  The rows of seats were all marked with\nthe class of employers that were expected to sit in them.  Labourers\nwere near the door.  The others were in successive rows forward,\nuntil the pew of the \"Admiral Superintendent,\" next the Altar rails,\nwas reached.  I took my seat among the \"artificers,\" being of that\norder. On coming out of church the master-attendant, next in dignity to\nthe admiral-superintendent, came up to me to say how distressed he was\nto see me \"among the artificers,\" and begged me in future to use his\nseat.  No doubt this was kindly intended, and I thanked him for his\ncourtesy.  Nevertheless I kept to my class of artificers.\nI did not like the \"breest o' the laft'\"*\n [footnote...\nThe breest o' the laft is the seat of dignity. The best places in\nchurches are occupied by \"superior\" people. In Scotland the chief men\n--the Provosts, Bailies, and Councillors--have a seat appropriated to\nthem in the front part of the gallery, generally opposite the minister.\nThat is \"the breest o' the laft.\"\nThe same principle pervades society generally.\n ...]\nprinciple.  No doubt the love of distinction, within reasonable limits,\nis a great social prime mover; but at Devonport, with the splitting up\ninto ranks, even amongst workmen, I found it simply amusing, especially\nwhen introduced into a church.\n\nI afterwards met with several veterans in the service of the Admiralty,\nwho are well served by such experienced and well-selected men.\nIt is the schemers and the satellites who haunt the contractors that\nare the vermin of dockyards.  I gave them all a very wide berth.\nBut worst of all are the men who get their employment through\nparliamentary influence.  They are a detestable set.  They always have\nsome \"grievance\" to pester people about.  I hope things are better now.\n\nI may add, with respect to the steam hammer pile-driving machines,\nthat I received an order for two of them from Mohammed Ali, the Pasha\nof Egypt.  These were required for driving the piles in that great work\n--the barrage of the Nile near Cairo.  The good services of these\nmachines so pleased the Pasha that he requested us to receive three\nselected Arab men into our works.  He asked that they should have the\nopportunity of observing the machinery processes and the system of\nmanagement of an English engineering factory.  The object of the Pasha\nwas that the men should return to Egypt and there establish an engine\nmanufactory, so as to render him in a measure independent of foreign\nhelp.  For British workmen, when imported into Egypt, had a great\ntendency to degenerate when removed from the wholesome stimulus to\nexertion in competition with their fellows.\n\nMy firm had no objection to the introduction of the Arab workmen.\nAccordingly, one day we received a visit from an excellent Egyptian\nofficer, Edim Bey, accompanied by his secretary Rushdi Effendi,\nwho spoke English fluently.  He thus made our interview with the Bey\neasy and agreeable.  He conveyed to us, in the most courteous manner,\nthe wishes of the Pasha; and the three workmen were at once received.\nEvery opportunity was given them to observe and understand the works\ngoing forward.  They were intelligent-looking young men, about\ntwenty-five years of age.  One of them was especially bright looking,\nquick in the expression of his eyes, and active in his manner,\nHis name was Affiffi Lalli; the names of the others I forget.\n\nThese young men were placed under charge of the foremen of the\ndepartments that each fancied to be most to his taste.  Affiffi was\nplaced in the fitting department, in which skilful manipulation was\nrequired.  He exhibited remarkable aptitude, and was soon able to hold\nhis own alongside of our best workmen.  Another was set to the turning\ndepartment, and did fairly well.  The third was placed in the foundry,\nwhere he soon became efficient in moulding and casting brass and iron\nwork.  He lent a hand all round, and picked up a real practical\nknowledge of the various work in his department.  During their sojourn\nin our works they became friendly with their colleagues; and in fact\nbecame quite favourites with the men, who were always willing to help\nthem.  But Affiffi Lalli was regarded as the genius of the trio.\nHe showed a marked and intelligent aptitude for acquiring technical\nskill in all the branches of our business.\n\nAfter remaining with us for about four years they were ready to return\nto Cairo, and show what they had learned in practical and technical\nmechanical knowledge during their stay in England.  The three Arab\nworkmen were placed in their suitable departments in the Pasha's work\nshops.  But such was the natural energy of Affiffi, that when he was\nset to work beside the slow, dilatory, and stupid native workmen,\nhe became greatly irritated.  The contrast between the active energetic\nmovements which he had seen at the Bridgewater Foundry and the\nineffective, blundering, and untechnical work of his fellows was such\nthat he could not stand it any longer.  So one fine day he disappeared\nfrom the works, took refuge on board a British steamer, and at the risk\nof his neck made his way back to the Bridgewater Foundry!\n\nAs we were reluctant to take back a man who had escaped from the\nPasha's employment--excellent workman though he was--we declined to\nemploy him.  But I gave Affiffi a note of introduction to Boulton and\nWatt of Soho, Birmingham, and there he was employed.  He afterwards\npassed into other firms, and having employed his skill in making some\nneedle machinery at Redditch, he settled down there.  He married a\nWarwickshire lass, and had a family--half Arab, half English--\nand has now a thriving foundry and engineer workshop of his own.\nThis little narrative shows that the Arab has still much of the\nwonderful energy and skill that once made the Moors masters of a large\npart of South-Western Europe.\n\nWe had many visitors at the foundry--from London,\nfrom the manufacturing districts, and from foreign countries.\nOne day a young gentleman presented a letter from Michael Faraday,\ndated \"Royal Institution, 29th May 1847,\" requesting me to pay him some\nattention and show him round the works.  I did so with all my heart,\nand wrote to Mr. Faraday intimating how much pleasure it gave me to\nserve him in any respect.  I cannot refrain from giving his answer.\nHe said:\n\n\"MY DEAR SIR--That you should both show kindness to the bearer of my\nletter, and prove that you did so with pleasure by writing me a letter\nin return, was indeed more than I ought or could have expected;\nbut it was very gratifying and pleasant to my mind.  I only wish that\nthe circumstances of my life were such as to enable me to take\nadvantage of such goodwill on your part, and to be more in your company\nand conversation than is at present possible.\n\n\"I could imagine great pleasure from such a condition of things;\nbut though our desires, and even our hopes at times spread out\nbeforehand over a large extent, it is wonderful how, as the future\nbecomes the present, the circumstances that surround us limit the\nsphere to which our real life is circumscribed If ever I come your way\nI hope to see your face; and the hope is pleasant, though the reality\nmay never arrive.\n\n\"You tell me of the glorious work of your pile-driver, and it must be\nindeed a great pleasure to witness the result.  Is it not Shakespeare\nwho says, 'The pleasure we delight in physics pain'?  In all your\nfatigue and labour you must have this pleasure in abundance, and a most\ndelightful and healthy enjoyment it is.  I shall rejoice to see some\nday a blow of the driver and a tap of the hammer.\n\n\"You speak of some experiments on hardening and tempering steel in\nwhich we can help you.  I hope when you do come to town you will let us\nhave the pleasure of doing so.  Our apparatus, such as it is, shall be\nentirely at your service.  I made, a long while ago, a few such\nexperiments on steel wire, but could eliminate no distinct or peculiar\nresults.  You will know how to look at things, and at your hand I\nshould expect much.\n\n\"Here we are just lecturing away, and I am too tired to attempt\nanything, much less to do anything just now; but the goodwill of such\nmen as you is a great stimulus, and will, I trust even with me,\nproduce something else praiseworthy.\n\nEver, my dear Nasmyth, yours most truly,   M. FARADAY.\"\n\n\nCHAPTER 16.  Nuremberg--St. Petersburg--Dannemora.\n\nIn the autumn of 1842 I had occasion to make a journey to Nuremberg in\ncompany with my partner Mr. Gaskell.  We had been invited to a\nconference with the directors of the Nuremberg and Munich Railroad as\nto the supply of locomotives for working their line.  As this was\nrather an important and extensive transaction, we thought it better not\nto trust to correspondence, but to see the directors on the spot.\nWe found that there were several riskful conditions attached to the\nproposed contract, which we considered it imprudent to agree to.\nWe had afterwards good reason to feel satisfied that we had not yielded\nto the very tempting commercial blandishments that were offered to us,\nbut that we refrained from undertaking an order that required so many\nimportant modifications.\n\nNevertheless, I was exceedingly delighted with the appearance of the\ncity of Nuremberg.  It carries one back to the mediaeval times!\nThe architecture, even of the ordinary houses, is excellent.\nSt. Lawrence, St. Sebald's, and the Frauenkirche, are splendid specimens\nof Gothic design.  The city is surrounded by old walls and turrets,\nby ramparts and bastions, enclosed by a ditch faced with masonry.\nVery few cities have so well escaped the storm of war and sieges in the\nMiddle Ages, and even in modern times.  Everything has been carefully\npreserved, and many of the best houses are still inhabited by the\nfamilies whose forefathers originally constructed them.  But \"progress\"\nis beginning to affect Nuremberg.  It is the centre of railways;\nbuildings are extending in all directions; tram-cars are running in the\nstreets; and before long, I fear, the ditch will be filled up,\nthe surrounding picturesque walls and towers demolished, and the city\nthrown open to the surrounding country.\n\nI visited the house of Albert Durer, one of the greatest artists who\never lived.  He was a man of universal genius--a painter, sculptor,\nengraver, mathematician, and engineer.  He was to Germany what Leonardo\nda Vinci was to Italy.  His house is wonderfully preserved.\nYou see his entrance hall, his exhibition room, his bedroom,\nhis studio, and the opening into which his wife--that veritable Xantippe\n--thrust the food that was to sustain him during his solitary hours of\nlabour.  I saw his grave, too, in the old churchyard beyond the\nThiergarten gate.  I saw the bronze plate commemorating the day of his\ndeath.  \"Emigravit 8 idus Aprilis 1528.\"  \"Emigravit\" only, for the true\nartist never dies.  Hans Sachs's grave is there too--the great\nReformation poet of Luther's time.\n\nAdam Krafft must have been a great sculptor, though his name is little\nknown out of Nuremberg.  Perhaps his finest work is in St. Lawrence\nCathedral--the Sacramentshauslein, or the repository for the sacred\nwafer--a graceful tapering stone spire of florid Gothic open work,\nmore than sixty feet high, which stands at the opening of the right\ntransept.  Its construction and decoration occupied the sculptor and\nhis two apprentices no less than five years; and all that he received\nfor his hard labour and skilful work was 770 gulden, or about #80\nsterling.  No wonder that he died in the deepest distress.\nSt. Sebald's and the Frauenkirche also contain numerous specimens of\nhis admirable work.\n\nIn the course of the following year (1843) it was necessary for me to\nmake a journey to St. Petersburg.  My object was to endeavour to\nobtain an order for a portion of the locomotives required for working\nthe line between that city and Moscow.  The railway had been\nconstructed under the engineership of Major Whistler, father of the\nwell-known artist; and it was shortly about to be opened.  It appeared\nthat the Emperor Nicholas was desirous of securing a home supply of\nlocomotives, and that, like a wise monarch, he wished to employ his own\nsubjects rather than foreigners in producing them.  No one could object\nto this.\n\nThe English locomotive manufacturers were not aware of the Emperor's\nintention.  When I arrived in the city I expected an order for\nlocomotives.  The representatives of the principal English firms were\nthere like myself; they, too, expected a share of the order.\nIt so happened that at the table d'hote dinner I sat near a very\nintelligent American, with whom I soon became intimate.  He told me\nthat he was very well acquainted with Major Whistler, and offered to\nintroduce me to him.  By all means!  There is no thing like friendly\nfeelings in matters of business.\n\nThe Major gave me a frank and cordial reception, and informed me of the\nposition of affairs.  The Emperor, he said, was desirous of training a\nclass of Russian mechanics to supply not only the locomotives but to\nkeep them constantly in repair.  He could not solely depend upon\nforeign artisans for the latter purpose.  The locomotives must be made\nin Russia.  The Emperor had given up the extensive premises of the\nImperial China Manufactory, which were to be devoted to the manufacture\nof engines.\n\nThe Major appointed Messrs.  Eastwick, Harrison, and Wynants, to supply\nthe entire mechanical plant of the railway.  I saw that it would be of\nno use to apply for any order for locomotives; but I offered to do all\nthat I could to supply the necessary details.  In the course of a few\ndays I was introduced to Joseph Harrison, the chief mechanic of the\nfirm; and I then entered into a friendship which proved long and\nlasting.  He gave me a large order for boilers, and for detail parts of\nthe Moscow engines--all of which helped him forward in the completion\nof the locomotives.  We also supplied many of our special machine tools,\nwithout which engines could not then be very satisfactorily made or\nkept in repair.  In this way I was in all respects highly remunerated\nfor my journey.\n\nThe enjoyment of my visit to St. Petersburg was much enhanced by\nfrequent visits to my much valued friend General Alexander Wilson.\nHe was a native of Edinburgh, and delighted to enjoy cracks with me\nupon subjects of mutual interest.  His sister, who kept house for him,\njoined in our conversation.  She had been married to the Emperor Paul's\nphysician, who was also a Scotsman, and was able to narrate many\nterrible events in relation to Russian Court affairs.  The General had\nworked his way upwards, like the rest of us.  During the principal part\nof his life he had superintended the great mechanical establishments at\nAlexandrosky and Colpenha, where about 3000 operatives were employed.\nThese establishments were originally founded by the Empress Catherine\nfor the purpose of creating a native manufacturing population capable\nof carrying on textile and mechanical works of all kinds.\nThe sail-cloth for the Russian navy was manufactured at Alexandrosky by\nexcellent machinery.  Cotton fabrics were also manufactured, as well as\nplaying cards, which were a Crown monopoly.  The great establishment at\nColpenha consisted of a foundry, a machine manufactory, and a mint--\nwhere the copper money of the empire was coined.  General Wilson was\nthe directing chief officer of all these establishments.\n\nThrough him I had the happiness of being introduced to General Greg,\nson of the great admiral who shed such honour on the Russian flag\nduring the reign of the Empress Catherine.  He was then well advanced\nin years, but full of keen intelligence and devoted to astronomical\npursuits.  He was in a great measure the founder of the Imperial\nObservatory at Pulkowa, situated on an appropriate eminence about eight\nmiles from St. Petersburg.  The observatory was furnished under his\ndirections with the most magnificent astronomical instruments.\nI had the honour to be introduced by him to the elder Struve, whose\nastronomical labours procured him a well-earned reputation throughout\nEurope.  I had the rare happiness of spending some nights with Struve,\nwhen he showed me the wonderful capabilities of his fine instruments.\nThe observatory is quite imperial in its arrangement and management,\nand was supported in the most liberal manner by the Emperor Nicholas.\nIndeed, it is a perfect example of what so noble an establishment\nshould be.\n\nStruve most kindly invited me to come whenever the state of the weather\npermitted him to show forth the wonderful perfection of his\ninstruments,--a rare chance, which I seized every opportunity of\nenjoying.  It was quite a picture to see the keen interest and intense\nenjoyment with which the profound astronomer would seat himself at his\ninstrument and pick out some exquisite test objects, such as the double\nstars in Virgo, Cygnus, or Ursa Major.  The beautiful order and\nneatness with which the instruments were kept in their magnificent\nappropriate apartments, each having its appropriate observer proceeding\nquietly with his allotted special work, with nothing to break the\nsilence but the \"tick, tack!\" of the sidereal clock--this was indeed\na most impressive sight!  And the kindly companionable manner of the\ngreat master of the establishment was in all respects in harmony with\nthe astronomical work which he conducted in this great Temple of the\nUniverse!\n\nThrough my friendship with General Wilson I was enabled to extend my\nacquaintance with many of my countrymen who had been long settled at\nSt. Petersburg in connection with commercial affairs.  I enjoyed their\nkind hospitality, and soon found myself quite at home amongst them.\nI remained in the city for about two months.  During that time I was\nconstantly about.  The shops, the streets, the houses, the museums,\nwere objects of great interest.  The view of the magnificent buildings\nalong the sides of the quay is very imposing.  Looking from the front\nof the statue of Peter the Great you observe the long facade of the\nAdmiralty, the column of Alexander, the Winter Palace, and other public\nbuildings.  The Neva flows in front of them in a massive volume of pure\nwater.  On an island opposite stands the citadel.  The whole presents a\ncoup d'oeil of unexampled architectural magnificence.\n\nI was much interested by the shops and their signboards. The latter\nwere fixed all over the fronts of the shops, and contained a\ndelineation of the goods sold within. There was no necessity for\nreading.  The pictorial portraits told their own tale.\nThey were admirable specimens of what is called still-life pictures;\nnot only as regards the drawing and colouring of each object, but with\nrespect to the grouping, which was in most cases artistic and natural.\nTwo reasons were given me for this style of artistic sign-painting:\none was that many of the people could not read the written words\ndefining the articles sold within; and the other was that the severe\nand long-continued frosts of the St. Petersburg winter rendered large\nshop windows impossible for the proper display of the goods.\nHence the small shop-windows to keep out the cold, and the large\npainted signboards to display the articles sold inside.\n\nI was also greatly pleased with the manner in which the Russians employ\nivy in screening their windows during summer.  Ivy is a beautiful\nplant, and is capable of forming a most elegant window-screen.\nNothing can be more beautiful than to look through green leaves.\nNearly every window of the ground flat of the houses in St. Petersburg\nis thus screened.  The neat manner in which the ivy plants are trained\nover ornamental forms of cane is quite a study in its way.  And though\nthe ivy is very common, yet a common thing, being a thing of beauty,\nmay be a \"joy for ever.\"  In the finer and most important mansions,\nthe sides of the flight of wide steps that lead up to the reception\nrooms were beautifully decorated by oleander plants, growing in great\nvigour, with their fine flowers as fresh as if in a carefully-kept\nconservatory.  Other plants of an ornamental kind were mixed with the\noleander, but the latter appeared to be the favourite.*\n [footnote...\nWhile passing through Lubeck on my way out to St. Petersburg I was much\nstruck with the taste for flower-plants displayed by the people of that\nold-world city.  The inner side of the lower house windows were all\nbeautifully decorated with flowers, which were evidently well cared\nfor.  Some of the windows were almost made up with flowers.\nPerhaps the long-continued winter of these parts has caused the people\nto study and practise within-door culture with such marked success.\nIt is a most elegant pursuit, and should be cultivated everywhere.\nIt is thoroughly in character with the exquisite cleanliness and\ntidiness of the houses at Lubeck.\n ...]\n\nAbout the end of my visit I was about to call upon one of my customers\nwith reference to my machine tools; for though I pursued pleasure at\noccasional times, I never lost sight of business.  It was a very dull\nday, and the streets about the Winter Palace were almost deserted.\nI was sitting in my drosky with my roll of drawings resting on my thigh\n--somewhat in the style of a commander-in-chief as represented in the\nold pictures--when I noticed a drosky coming out of the gates of the\nWinter Palace.  I observed that it contained a noble-looking officer in\na blue military cloak sitting behind his drosky driver.  My driver\ninstantly took off his hat, and I, quickly following his example,\ntook off my hat and bowed gracefully, keeping my extended hand on the\nlevel of my head--a real royal salute.  The person was no other than\nthe Emperor Nicholas!  He fixed his pecuniarily fine eyes upon me and\ngave me one of the grandest military salutes, accompanied, as I thought,\nwith a kindly smile from his magnificent eyes as he passed close by me.\n\nAs I had been lunching with a Dutch engineer about half an hour before,\nand had a glass or two of champagne, this may have had something to do\nwith my daring to give the Emperor, in his own capital, what I was\nafterwards told was not a bow but a brotherly recognition between\npotentates, and only by royal usage allowed to be so given,--namely,\nswaying off the hat at arm's length level with the head, so as to infer\nroyal equality, or something of that sort. When I narrated to some\nRussian friends what I had done, they told me that I need not be\nsurprised if I received a visit from the chief of police next morning\nfor my daring to salute the Emperor in such a style.  But the Emperor\nwas doubtless more amused than offended, and I never received the\nexpected visit.\n\nTo anticipate a little.  Soon afterwards the Emperor sent me a present\nof a magnificent diamond ring through his ambassador in England--\nBaron Brunnow.  It was also accompanied, as the Baron informed me,\nwith the Emperor's most gracious thanks for the manner in which my\nsteam hammer had driven the piles for his new forts at Cronstadt, which\nhe had seen in full action.  The steam-hammer pile-driver had also been\nused for driving the piles of the great bridge at Kieff.\nI next received an order for one of my largest steam hammers for the\nImperial Arsenal, and it was followed by many more.  It is a singular\nfact, as showing the readiness of the Russian and other foreign\nGovernments to adopt at an early date any mechanical improvement of\nascertained utility, that I supplied steam hammers to the Russian\nGovernment twelve months before our Admiralty availed themselves of its\nenergetic action.  The French were the first to adopt the invention;\nthanks to the insight of M. Bourdon, who had the opportunity of\nrecognising its importance.\n\nBefore I leave this part of my subject, I must not omit to mention my\nfriend Mr. Francis Baird, the zealous son of Sir Charles Baird.\nThe latter was among the first to establish iron foundries and engine\nworks at St. Petersburg.  At the time of my visit he was far advanced\nin years, and unable to attend personally to the very large business\nwhich he had established.  But he was nevertheless full of geniality.\nHe greatly enjoyed the long conversations which he had with me about\nhis friends in Scotland, many of whom I knew.   He also told me about\nthe persons in his employment.  He said that the workmen were all\nserfs, or the sons of serfs.  The Empress Catherine had given them to\nhim for the purpose of being trained in his engine foundry, and in his\nsugar refinery, which was another part of the business.  I had rarely\nseen a more faithful and zealous set of workmen than these Russian\nserfs.  They were able and skilful, and attached to their employers by\nsome deeper and stronger tie than that of mere money wages.\nIndeed, they were treated by Sir Charles Baird and his son with the\nkindest and most paternal care, and they duly repaid their attachment\nby their zeal in his service and the excellent quality of their work.\n\nThe most important business in hand at the time of my visit to the\nfoundry was the moulding and casting of the magnificent bronze capitals\nof the grand portico of the Izak Church.  This building is one of the\nfinest in St. Petersburg.  It is of grand proportions,--simple,\nnoble, and massive.  It is built upon a forest of piles.  The walls of\nthe interior are covered with marble.  The malachite columns for the\nscreen are fifty feet high, and exceed everything that has yet been\ndone in that beautiful mineral.  The great dome is of iron covered\nwith gilt copper.  This, as well as the Corinthian capitals of bronze,\nwas manufactured at the foundry of the Bairds.  The tympanum of the\nfour great porticos consisted of colossal groups of alto-relievo\nfigures, many of which were all but entirely detached from the\nbackground.  It was a kind of foundry work of the highest order,\nall the details and processes requiring the greatest care.\nTo my surprise every one engaged in this gigantic and refined metal\nwork was a serf.  The full-sized plaster models which they used in\nmoulding were executed by a resident French sculptor.  He was a true\nartist, and of the highest order.  But to see the skilful manner in\nwhich these native workmen, drawn from the staff of the Bairds'\nordinary foundry workers, performed their duties, was truly surprising.\nIt would make our best bronze statuary founders wince to be asked to\nexecute such work.  Judging from what I saw of the Russian workmen in\nthis instance, I should say that Russia has a grand future before it.\n\nHaving satisfactorily completed all my business arrangements in\nSt. Petersburg, I prepared to set out homewards.  But as I had some\nbusiness to transact at Stockholm and Copenhagen I resolved to visit\nthose cities.  I left St. Petersburg for Stockholm by a small steamer,\nwhich touched at Helsingfors and Abo, both in Finland.  The weather was\nbeautiful.  Clear blue shy and bright sunshine by day, and the light\nprolonged far into the night.  Even in September the duration of the\nsunshine is so great and the night so short that the air has scarcely\ntime to cool till it gets heated again by the bright morning rays.\nEven at twelve at night the sun dips but a little beneath the bright\nhorizon on the north.  The night is so bright in the Abo latitude that\none can read the smallest print.\n\nNothing can be more beautiful than the charming scenery we passed\nthrough in our tortuous voyage to Stockholm.  We threaded between the\ngranite islands which crowd the shores of the Baltic.  They are covered\nwith pines, which descend to the water's edge.  We swept them with our\npaddle-boxes, and dipped their bright green fronds into the perfectly\nclear sea.  For about two days our course lay through those beautiful\nsmall islands.  It seemed like a voyage through fairyland.\nAnd it continued in this exquisite tranquil way until we reached that\ncrowning feature of all--the magnificent city of Stockholm, sleeping,\nas it were, on the waters of the Malar Lake, and surrounded by noble\nmountains clad with pines.  With the exception of Edinburgh, Genoa,\nand Naples, I had never beheld so noble a city with such magnificent\nsurroundings.\n\nI spent but a short time in Stockholm, but quite sufficient to enable\nme to see much that was grandly beautiful in its neighbourhood.\nLakes, rocks, and noble trees abounded, and exquisite residences peeped\nout through the woods, giving evidences of high civilisation. Elegance\nof taste and perfect domestic arrangements supplied every form of\nrational comfort and enjoyment.  My old friend Sir John Ross, of Arctic\ncelebrity, was settled at Stockholm as chief consul for Her Majesty.\nHe introduced me to several of the leading English merchants, from whom\nI received much kind attention.  Mr. Erskine invited me to spend a day\nor two at his beautiful villa in the neighbourhood.  It was situated on\nthe side of a mountain, and overlooked a lake that reminded me very\nmuch of Loch Katrine.  Fine timber grew about, in almost inaccessible\nplaces, on the tops of precipices, and in shelves and clefts among the\nrocks.  The most important result of my visit was an introduction to\nBaron Tam, the proprietor and chief director of the great Dannemora\nIron Mine.\n\nI was at once diverted for a time from my voyage to Copenhagen.\nI was most desirous of seeing in person this celebrated mine.\nThe baron most willingly furnished me with several letters of\nintroduction to his managers, and I proceeded to Dannemora by way of\nUpsala.  I was much interested by this city, by its cathedral,\ncontaining the tomb of Gustavas Vasa, and by its many historical\nassociations.  But I was still more impressed by Old Upsala, about\nthree miles distant.  This is a place of great antiquity.  It is only a\nlittle hamlet now, though at one time it must have been the centre of a\nlarge population.  The old granite church was probably at one time a\npagan temple.  Outside, and apart from it, is a wooden bell-tower,\nerected in comparatively modem times.   In a wooden box inside the\nchurch is a wooden painted god, a most unlikely figure to worship.\nAnd yet the Swedes in remote parts of the country carefully preserve\ntheir antique wooden gods.\n\nThe great sacrifices to Odin were made at Old Upsala.\nOutside the church, in a row, are three great mounds of earth, erected\nin commemoration of Odin, Thor, and Freia--hence our Wednesday,\nThursday, and Friday.  These mounds, of about 60 feet high and 232 feet\nin diameter, were in former times used as burying-places for the great\nand valiant.  I went into a cottage near the tumuli, and drank a bumper\nof mead to the memory of Thor from a very antique wooden vessel.\nI made an especial reverential obeisance to Thor, because I had a great\nrespect for him as being the great Hammerman, and one of our craft,--\nthe Scandinavian Vulcan.\n\nI drove back to Upsala, and remained there for the night.\nIt is a sleepy silent place.  The only sound I heard was the voice of\nthe watchman calling out the small hours of the morning from his\nstation on the summit of the cathedral tower.  As the place is for the\nmost part built of wood, this precaution in the shape of a watchman who\ncan see all points of the city is a necessary one in case of fire.\n\nNext morning I hired a small sort of gig of a very primitive\nconstruction, with a boy for driver.  His duty was to carry me to the\nnext post-house, and there leave me to be carried forward by another\nsimilar conveyance.  But the pony No.  2 was about a mile off, occupied\nin drawing a plough, so that I had to wait until the job was over.\nIn about an hour or so I was again under weigh.  And so on da capo,\nuntil about six in the evening, when I found myself within sight of the\ngreat mine.  The post-house where I was set down was an inn, though\nwithout a signboard.  The landlady was a bright, cheery, jolly woman.\nShe could not speak a word of English, nor I a word of Dannemora\nSwedish.  I was very thirsty and hungry, and wanted something to eat.\nHow was I to communicate my wishes to the landlady?  I resorted,\nas I often did, to the universal language of the pencil.  I took out my\nsketch-book, and in a few seconds made a sketch of a table, with a dish\nof smoking meat upon it, a bottle and a glass, a knife and fork,\na loaf, a saltcellar, and a corkscrew.  She looked at the drawing and\ngave a hearty laugh.  She nodded pleasantly, showing that she clearly\nunderstood what I wanted.  She asked me for the sketch, and went into\nthe back garden to show it to her husband, who inspected it with great\ndelight.  I went out and looked about the place, which was very\npicturesque.  After a short time, the landlady came to the door and\nbeckoned me in, and I found spread out on the table everything that I\ndesired--a broiled chicken, smoking hot from the gridiron, a bottle\nof capital home-brewed ale, and all the et ceteras of an excellent\nrepast.  I made use of my pencil in many ways.  I always found that a\nsketch was more useful than a blundering sentence.  Besides,\nit generally created a sympathy between me and my entertainers.\n\n[Image]  The order for dinner\n\nMy visit to the Dannemora Mine at Osterby was one of peculiar interest.\nI may in the first place say that the immense collection of iron ore at\nthat point has been the result of the upheaval of a vast volume of\nmolten igneous ore, which has been injected into the rock, or deposited\nin masses under the crust of the earth.  In some cases the quarried ore\nyields from 50 to 70, and even as much as 90 per cent of iron.\nThe Dannemora Mine is a vast quarry open to the sky. When you come near\nit the place looks like a vast deep pit, with an unfathomable bottom.\nGhostlike, weird-looking pinnacles of rocks stand out from its profound\ndepths; but beyond these you see nothing but wreaths of smoke curling\nup from below.  The tortuous chasm in the earth, caused by the quarries\nbeneath, is about half a mile long, and about a thousand feet wide.\n\n[Image]  Dannemora iron mine.  After a drawing by James Nasmyth.\n\nThe first process of the workmen in the quarries below is devoted to\nbreaking into small fragments the great masses of ore scattered about\nby the previous night's explosions.  These are sent to the surface in\ngreat tubs attached to wire ropes, which are drawn up by gins worked by\nhorses.  Other miners are engaged in boring blast holes in the ore,\nwhich displays itself in great wide veins in the granite sides of the\nvast chasm.  These blast holes are charged with gunpowder, each with a\nmatch attached.  At the end of the day the greater number of the miners\nare drawn up in the cages or tubs, while a few are left below to light\nthe slow-burning matches attached to about a hundred charged bore\nholes.  The rest of the miners are drawn up, and then begins the\ntremendous bombardment.  I watched the progress of it from a stage\nprojecting over the wild-looking yawning gulph.  It was grand to hear\nthe succession of explosions that filled the bottom of the mine far\nbeneath me.  Then the volumes of smoke, through the surface of which\nmasses of rock were sometimes sent whirling up into the clear blue sky,\nand fell back again into the pit below.  Such an infernal cannonade I\nhave never witnessed.  In some respects it reminded me of the crater of\nVesuvius, from which such dense clouds of steam and smoke and fire are\nthrown up.  In the course of the night, the suffocating smoke and\nsulphureous gases has time to pass away, and next morning the workmen\nwere ready to begin their operations as before.\n\nThe ore extracted from this great mine is smelted in blast furnaces\nwith wood charcoal, and forged into bars.  The charcoal is, of course,\nentirely free from sulphur.  When sent to Sheffield the iron is placed\nin fire-brick troughs closely surrounded by powdered charcoal.\nAfter a few days' exposure to red heat, the iron is converted into\nsplendid steel, which has given such a reputation to that great\nmanufacturing town.  It is also the steel from which the firm of Stubbs\nand Company, of Warrington (to which I have already  referred),\nproduce their famous P.S.  files.\n\nAfter the explosions had ceased at the mine, I went with one of the\nmanagers to see the great Bar forge.  It was a picturesque sight to see\nthe forgemen at work with the tilt hammers under the glowing light of\nthe furnaces.  I inspected the machinery and forge works throughout,\nand had thus the opportunity of seeing the whole proceeding, from the\nblasting and quarrying of the ore in the mine, the forging and rolling\nof the worked iron into their proper lengths, down to the final stamp\nor \"mark\" driven in by the blow of the tilt hammer at the end of each\nbar.  Having now thoroughly examined everything connected with this\ncelebrated iron mine, I prepared to set out for Stockholm in the same\nway as I had come.  To prepare the landlord for my setting out,\nI again resorted to my pencil.  I made a drawing of the little gig and\npony, with the sun rising, and the hour at which I wished to start.\nHe understood it in a moment, and next morning the trap was at the door\nat the specified time.\n\nBefore I left Stockholm I made a careful and elaborate panoramic sketch\nof the city, as a companion to the one I had made of Genoa from the\nharbour a year before.  I made this one from the summit of the King's\nPark, which is the favourite pleasure-ground of the people.\nI was ferried across in a little paddle-wheel boat, worked by\nDalecarlian women in their peculiar costumes.  The King's Park,\nor Djurgard, is doubly beautiful, not only from its panoramic view of\nthe city, the Malar Lake, and the arm of the Baltic, which comes up to\nthe Skeppsbron Quay, but also from the magnificent oak trees with which\nit is studded.  These noble trees, as foreground objects, are perfect\npictures.  The masses of rock are grand, and the drives are beautifully\nkept.  No wonder that the Swedes are so proud of this beautiful park,\nfor it is the finest in Europe.\n\nI left Stockholm for Gottenburg by steamer.  This is one of the most\npicturesque routes in Sweden.  First, we passed through the Malar Lake\n--one of the most beautiful pieces of water in the world.  It contains\nno less than fourteen hundred islands, mostly covered with wood.\nOf course we did not see one twentieth part of the lake; we only\nsteamed along its eastern shore for about twenty miles on our way to\nSodertelye, where the Gotha Canal begins.  We then reached the small\nMaran Lake, and afterwards an arm of the Baltic.  We passed numberless\nislands and rocks and reached the Slatbacken Fiord, which we entered.\nBeautiful scenery surrounds the entrance to the fiord.  In the morning,\nafter rising up the locks between Mariehop and Wenneberga, and passing\nthrough Lakes Roxen and Boren, we found ourselves at Motala, near the\nentrance to the Wettern Lake.\n\nMotala is a place of great importance in the manufacturing industry of\nSweden.  When I visited it, the iron-foundry was in charge of\nMr. Caulson, a native of the country.  I had known him some years\nbefore in London, and had the highest opinion of his ability as a\nconstructive engineer.  He was surrounded at Motala with everything in\nthe way of excellently arranged workshops, good machine tools,\nas well as abundant employment for them.  Indeed, this is the largest\niron-foundry in Sweden, where iron steamers, steam-engines, and rolling\nmills are made.  From its central position it has a great future before it.\n\nThe steamer crosses the lake to Carlsborg, at the entrance to the fiord\nand canal that leads to Lakes Wiken and Wenern.  The latter is an\nimmense lake--in fact, an inland sea.  During a great part of the\ntime we were out of sight of land.  At length we reached Wenersborg,\nand passed down the Charles Canal.  A considerable time is required to\nenable the steamer to pass from lock to lock--nine locks in all--\ndown to the level of the Gotha River.  During that time an opportunity\nwas afforded us for seeing the famous Trollhatten Falls--a very fine\npiece of Nature's workmanship.\n\n[Image] Part of Trollhatten Falls\n\nBefore leaving the subject of Sweden, I feel that I must say a word or\ntwo about the Swedish people.  I admired them exceedingly.\nThey are tall, fair, good-looking.  They are among the most civil and\nobliging people that I have ever met.  I never encountered a rude word\nor a rude look from them.  In their homes they are simple and natural.\nI liked the pleasing softness of their voices, so sweet and musical--\n\"a most excellent thing in woman.\"  There was a natural gentleness in\ntheir deportment.  All classes, even the poorest, partook of it.\nTheir domestic habits are excellent.  They are fond of their homes;\nand, above all things, they are clean and tidy.  They strew the floors\nof their ground apartments with spruce pine twigs, which form a natural\ncarpet as well as give out a sweet balsamic perfume.  These are swept\naway every morning and replaced with fresh material.\n\nWith their many virtues, the Swedes are a most self-helping people.\nThey are hard-working and honest, true and straightforward.\nIn matters of commerce they are men of their word.  They are\nclear-headed, honest-minded, and keen in their desire for knowledge.\nTheir natural simple common sense enables them to clear away all\nparasitical and traditional rubbish from their minds, and to stand\nbefore us as men of the highest excellence.  All happiness and\nprosperity to dear old Sweden!\n\nI set out from Gottenburg to Helsingborg, along the shores of the\nKattegat.  From Helsingborg I crossed the Sound by a small steamer to\nElsinore, famous for its connection with Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.\nThe old dreary looking castle still stands there.  From Elsinore I went\nto Copenhagen, and occupied myself for a few days in visiting the\nwonderful museums.  There I saw, in the Northern Antiquities\nCollection, the unwritten history of civilisation in the stone, bronze,\nand iron tools which have brought the world to what it is now.\nThis museum is perfectly unrivalled.  I saw there the first section of\nkitchen-middens--that is, the refuse of oyster shells, fish-bones,\nand other stuff thrown out by the ancient inhabitants of the country\nafter their meals; together with accumulations of rude stone\nimplements, kelts, arrow-heads, and such like.\nThen there were the articles of the Bronze Age, with war trumpets;\nthe articles of the early Iron Age, which also contain some remarkable\ngolden war horns.  These are followed by the middle Iron Age,\nand then by the later Iron Age.  This part of the collection is superb.\nBut it is impossible for me to describe the wonders of the museum.\n\nI was greatly interested too by the collection of articles at the\nRosenburg Castle.  This is the only museum at Copenhagen which is not\nfree; but the price charged is very small.  It contains an extraordinary\ncollection of royal clothes (what would Sartor Resartus say?), armour,\nfurniture, drinking vessels, and all manner of personal antiquities\nconnected with the Kings of Denmark.\n\nI was especially interested by the collection of royal drinking\nvessels, from the earliest, made of wood, down to the latest,\ngrand gold and silver flagons.  What most amused me in respect to these\nboozing implements were the pegs that marked the depths down to which\nthe stalwart Dane was able to swig at a pull one enormous draught of\nwine.  In some cases the name and date of the achievement of the heavy\ndrinker was engraved on the flagon to record his feat.\n\"Take him a peg down\" was the ordinary saying, and the words have\nbecome a proverb amongst ourselves.  For we unquestionably have derived\na great deal of our drinking capabilities from our ancestors the Danes.\nThe whole of the museums at Copenhagen are excellent.\n\nBesides those I have mentioned, are the Ethnographic Museum--the best\nof its kind; the Museum of Coins, the most complete I have seen;\nthe Thorwaldsen Museum; the Mineralogical Museum; the Zoological\nMuseum, and many more.  The custodians are most kind and civil; and\nwhen they see any visitor interested in the collection, they take a\nspecial pleasure in going round with him and pointing out the beauty\nand rarity of the articles, imparting at the same time most interesting\ninformation.  I wish those melancholy taciturn \"staff-in-hand\"\nattendant custodians of our British Museums could or would follow their\nexample, and thus aid the chief object of these costly institutions.\n\nHolding the memory of Tycho Brahe in the highest regard as one of the\ngreat pioneers of astronomy, I was much interested by a contemporary\nportrait of him in the Town Hall; but still more so by the remains of\nhis observatory at the top of the great Round Tower, where he carried\non his careful observations by instruments of his own design and\nconstruction.  These, with many additions, he afterwards transported to\nthe island of Hveen, where the remains of his castle and observatory\nare still to be seen; While I was mounting the Round Tower I could not\nbut think of the footsteps of the great astronomer who has made it\nclassic ground.\n\nI left Copenhagen for Hamburg by coach.  After passing through the\nisland of Zealand, I was ferried across to the island of Fyen, and\nafter that I proceeded along the mainland of Sleswick and Holstein.\nI was much pleased with what I saw of the people of these provinces.\nTheir farmhouses and cottages were wonderfully clean and neat.\nThe women were all engaged in scrubbing and polishing.  I believe I saw\nmore brass in the shape of bright door-knockers during my journey than\nI had seen in all England.  Even the brass and iron hoops round the\nmilk pails, by constant scrubbing, looked like gold and silver.\nEvery window had its neat dimity curtains edged with snow-white\ntrimming.  The very flower-pots were painted red, to fetch up their\nbrightness to the general standard.  I never saw a more cheerful and\nhappy-looking people than those whom I observed between Copenhagen and\nHamburg.  They seemed to me to be very like the people of England--\nespecially in the northern and eastern parts--in their oval faces,\ntheir bright blue eyes, and their light and golden hair, as well as\ntheir active minds and bodies, which enable them to do their work with\nhearty cheerful energy.\n\nI went from Hamburg to Amsterdam by steamer; and after doing a few\ndays' business I went to take a peep at the fine collections of\npictures there, as well as at the Hague.  Then I proceeded to\nRotterdam, and took ship for England by the Batavian steamer.\nI reached home safely after my prolonged tour.  Everything was going on\nwell at the Bridgewater Foundry.  The seeds which I had sown in the\nnorthern countries of Europe were already springing up plentifully in\norders for machine tools; and the clang of the hammer and the whirl of\nthe lathes and planing machines were working cheerily on from morning\ntill night.\n\n\nCHAPTER 17.  More about Bridgewater Foundry--Woolwich Arsenal.\n\nThe rapid extension of railways and steam navigation, both at home and\nabroad, occasioned a largely increased demand for machinery of all\nkinds.  Our order-book was always full; and every mechanical workshop\nfelt the impulse of expanding trade.  There was an increased demand for\nskilled mechanical labour--a demand that was far in excess of the\nsupply.  Employers began to outbid each other, and wages rapidly rose.\nAt the same time the disposition to steady exertion on the part of the\nworkmen began to decline.\n\nThis state of affairs had its usual effect.  It increased the demand\nfor self-acting tools, by which the employers might increase the\nproductiveness of their factories without having resort to the costly\nand untrustworthy method of meeting the demand by increasing the number\nof their workmen.  Machine tools were found to be of much greater\nadvantage.  They displaced hand-dexterity and muscular force.\nThey were unfailing in their action.  They could not possibly go wrong\nin planing and turning, because they were regulated by perfect\nself-acting arrangements.  They were always ready for work, and never\nrequired a Holiday or a Saint Monday.\n\nAs the Bridgewater Foundry had been so fortunate as to earn for itself\na considerable reputation for mechanical contrivances, the workshops\nwere always busy.  They were crowded with machine tools in full action,\nand exhibited to all comers their effectiveness in the most\nsatisfactory manner, Every facility was afforded to those who desired\nto see them at work; and every machine and machine tool that was turned\nout became in the hands of its employers the progenitor of a numerous\nfamily.\n\nIndeed, on many occasions I had the gratification of seeing my\nmechanical notions adopted by rival or competitive machine\nconstructors, often without acknowledgment; though, notwithstanding\nthis point of honour, there was room enough for all.  Though the parent\nfeatures were easily recognisable, I esteemed such plagiarisms as a\nsort of left-handed compliment to their author.  I also regarded them\nas a proof that I had hit the mark in so arranging my mechanical\ncombinations as to cause their general adoption, and many of them\nremain unaltered to this day.\n\nThe machine tools when in action did not require a skilled workman to\nguide or watch them.  All that was necessary to superintend them was a\nwell-selected labourer.  The self-acting machine tools already\npossessed the requisite ability to plane, to turn, to polish, and to\nexecute the work when firmly placed in situ.  The work merely required\nto be shifted from time to time, and carefully fixed for another action\nof the machine.\n\nBesides selecting clever labourers, I made an extensive use of active\nhandy boys to superintend the smaller class of self-acting machine\ntools.  To do this required little exertion of muscular force,\nbut only observant attention.  The machine tools did all the working\n(for the thinking had been embodied in them beforehand), and they\nturned out all manner of geometrical forms with the utmost correctness.\nThis sort of training educated the faculties of the lads, and trained\ntheir ideas to the perception of exactness of form, at the same time\nthat it gave them an intimate acquaintance with the nature of the\nmaterials employed in mechanical structures.  The rapidity with which\nthey thus acquired the efficiency of thoroughly practical mechanics was\nsurprising.\n\nAs the lads grew in strength they were promoted to the higher classes\nof work.  We gave to the foreman of each department the right to\nrecommend to a special rise of wages any lad who showed an extra\nintelligent earnestness and assiduity in superintending his machine.\nThis produced an active spirit of emulation, which not only advanced\ntheir efficiency but relieved the foreman from a source of irritation\nin the discharge of his duties.  I have already referred to the subject\nin a former portion of this narrative; but it cannot be too strongly\nurged upon the attention of proprietors of mechanical works.\nBesides making first-rate workmen, this method prevents the lads from\ngetting into habits of workshop dishonesty, i.e.  \"skulking,\" and other\nannoyances.\n\nMy system of non-binding of apprentices was the \"perfect cure,\"\nif I may so speak.  All that existed between us was mutual satisfaction\nwith each other, and that alone proved from first to last in every\nrespect a perfect bond.\n\nSo completely were the workmen in attendance on self-acting machines\nrelieved from the necessity of labour, that many of the employers,\nto keep the men from falling asleep, allowed them to attend to other\nmachines within their powers of superintendence.  This kept them fully\nawake.  The workmen cheerfully acquiesced in this arrangement,\nas a relief from tedium, and especially when a shilling extra was added\nto their wages for each additional machine.  All went well for a time,\nfor men as well as masters.  But now came the difficulty.\nThe system was opposed to the rules of the Trades' Union.\nTheir committee held that setting one man to superintend more than one\nmachine was keeping out of employment some other man who ought to be\nemployed.  And yet, at the time that the objection was made, such\npersons were not to be had.  The increased demand for skilled labour\nhad employed every spare workman.\n\nNevertheless the system, in the eyes of the Union, \"must be put down.\"\nThe demand was made that every machine must have a Union man to\nsuperintend it, and that he must be paid the full Union regulation\nwages.  All labourers and lads were to be discharged, and Union men\nemployed in their places.  As the times were good, and the workshops\nwere full of orders, it was thought by the Union that the time had come\nto put the matter to the test.  The campaign was opened by the\norganisation of a powerful body, entitled \"The Amalgamated Society of\nMechanical Engineers.\"  It included every class of workmen employed in\nthe trade--ironfounders, turners, fitters, erectors, pattern-makers,\nand such like.  All were invited to make common cause against the\nemployers.\n\nIn order to make a conspicuous demonstration of their power,\nthe Council of the Union first attacked the extensive firm of\nPlatt Brothers, Oldham.  The Council sent them a mandate to discharge\nall their labourers or other \"illegal hands\" from their works--all who\nwere employed in superintending their vast assortment of machinery--\nand to fill their places with \"legal mechanics\" at the then regulation\nwages.  The plan of the Union was to attack the employers one by one--\nto call out the hands of one particular workshop until the employers\nwere subdued and obeyed the commands of the Union; and then to attack\nanother employer in the same way.  The sagacity of this policy very\nmuch resembled that of the ostrich, which hides its head in hole and\nthinks it is concealed.  The employers knew the drift of the policy,\nand took steps to circumvent it.\n\nA mutual defence association was formed, and a decree was issued that,\nunless the demand of the Council against Platt's factory was withdrawn\nby a certain day, every employer would at once close his concern.\nThe Union, nevertheless, stuck to their guns--but only for a time.\nA strike took place.  The works of some of the most extensive employers\nof labour were closed.  Everything was paralysed for a time;\nthe men went about with their hands in their pockets, while the women\nand children at home were wanting food.  After a few weeks the funds of\nthe Amalgamated Society became so reduced that the men gradually\nretired from the contest.  Meanwhile, such concerns as contrived to\nkeep their workmen in full employment--of whom we were one made use\nof the occasion to act on the healthy system of what I have termed\n\"Free trade in ability.\"  We added, so far as we could, to the number of\nintelligent labourers, advanced them to the places which the Unionist\nworkmen had left at the order of their Council, and thus  kept our men\non full wages until the strike was over.  This was the last contest I\nhad with Trades' Unions.  One of the results was that I largely\nincreased the number of self-acting machines, and gave a still greater\namount of employment to my unbound apprentices. I placed myself in an\nalmost impregnable position, and showed that I could conduct my\nbusiness with full activity and increasing prosperity, and at the same\ntime maintain good-feeling between employed and employer.\n\nAnother important point was this,--that I always took care to make my\nforemen comfortable, and consequently loyal.  A great part of a man's\nsuccess in business consists in his knowledge of character.\nIt is not so much what he himself does, as what he knows his heads of\ndepartments can do.  He must know them intimately, take cognisance of\nthe leading points of their character, pick and choose from them,\nand set them to the work which they can most satisfactorily\nsuperintend.  Edward Tootal, of Manchester, said to me long before,\n\"Never give your men cause to look over the hedge.\"  He meant that I\nshould never give them any reason for looking for work elsewhere.\nIt was a wise saying, and I long remembered it.  I always endeavoured\nto make my men and foremen as satisfied as possible with their work,\nas well as with their remuneration.\n\nI never had any cause to regret that I had struck out an independent\ncourse in managing the Bridgewater Foundry.  The works were always\nbusy.  A cheerful sort of contentment and activity pervaded the entire\nestablishment.  Our order-book continued to be filled with the most\nsatisfactory class of entries.  The railway trucks in the yard,\nand the canal barges at the wharf, presented a busy scene,--\nshowing the influx of raw material and the output of finished work.\nThis happy state of affairs went on in its regular course without any\nspecial incident worthy of being mentioned.  The full and steady influx\nof prosperity that had been the result of many years of interesting\ntoil and cheerful exertion, had caused the place to assume the aspect\nof a smoothly working self-acting machine.\n\nBeing blessed with a sound constitution, I was enabled to perform all\nmy duties with hearty active good-will.  And as I had occasional\njourneys to make in connection with our affairs and interests,\nthese formed a very interesting variety in the ordinary course of my\ndaily work.  The intimate and friendly intercourse which I was so\nfortunate as to cultivate with the heads of the principal engineering\nfirms of my time, kept me well posted up in all that was new and\nadvanced in the way of improvements in mechanical processes.  I had at\nthe same time many pleasant opportunities of making suggestions as to\nfurther improvements, some of which took root and yielded results of no\nsmall importance.  These visits to my friends were always acceptable,\nif I might judge from the hearty tone of welcome with which I was\ngenerally received.\n\nI do not know what may be the case in other classes of businesses or\nprofessions, but as regards engineer mechanists and metal workers\ngenerally, there is an earnest and frank intercommunication of ideas--\nan interchange of thoughts and suggestions--which has always been a\nsource of the highest pleasure to me, and which I have usually found\nthoroughly reciprocated.  The subjects with which engineers have to\ndeal are of a wide range, and jealousy in intercommunication is almost\nentirely shut out.  Many of my friends were special \"characters.\"\nFor the most part they had made their own way in the world,\nlike myself.  I found among them a great deal of quaint humour.\nTheir talk was quite unconventional; and yet their remarks were well\nworth being treasured up in the memory as things to be thought about\nand pondered over.  Sometimes they gave the key to the comprehension of\nsome of the grandest functions in Nature, and an insight into the\noperation of those invariable laws which regulate the universe.\nFor all Nature is, as it were, a grand workshop, ruled over by an ever\npresent Almighty Master,--of whose perfect designs and works we are\nas yet only permitted to obtain hasty and imperfect glimpses.\n\nTo return to my own humbler progress.  From an early period of my\nefforts as a mechanical engineer, I had been impressed with the great\nadvantages that would result from the employment of small high-pressure\nsteam-engines of a simple and compact construction. These, I thought,\nmight suit the limited means and accommodation of small factories and\nworkshops where motive power was required.  The highly satisfactory\nresults which followed the employment of steam-engines of this class,\nsuch as I supplied shortly after beginning business in Manchester,\nled to a constantly increasing demand for them.  They were used for\nhoisting in and out the weighty bales of goods from the lofty\nManchester warehouses.  They worked the \"lifts,\" and also the pumps of\nthe powerful hydraulic presses used in packing the bales.\n\nThese small engines were found of service in a variety of ways.\nWhen placed in the lower parts of the building the waste steam was\nutilised in warming the various apartments of the house. The steam was\nconveyed in iron pipes, and thus obviated the risk of fire which\nattended the use of stoves and open fire-grates. I remember being much\npleased with seeing a neat arrangement of a \"hot-closet\" heated by the\nwaste steam conveyed from the bottom of the building.  This was used\nfor holding the dinners and teas of the minor clerks and workpeople.\nAnother enclosed place, heated by waste steam, was used for drying wet\nclothes and jackets during rainy weather.  Much attention was paid by\nthe employers to their workpeople in these respects. The former\nexhibited a great deal of kindly thoughtfulness. But men and master\nwere alike.  It was a source of the greatest pleasure to me,\nwhen looking round the warehouses and factories, to see the intelligent\nsteady energy that pervaded every department, from the highest to the\nlowest.\n\nI never lost sight of the importance of extending the use of my small\nsteam-engine system.  It was the most convenient method of applying\nsteam power to individual machines.  Formerly, the power to drive a\nmachine was derived from a very complicated arrangement of shafting and\ngearing brought from a distant engine.  But by my system I conveyed the\npower to the machine by means of a steam pipe, which enabled the engine\nto which it was attached to be driven either fast or slow, or to be\nstopped or started, just as occasion required.  It might be run while\nall the other machines were at rest; or, in the event of a breakdown of\nthe main engine of the factory, the small engine might still be kept\ngoing or even assist in the repairs of the large one.\n\nAn important feature in this mode of conveying power by means of piping\n--in place of gearing and shifting belts and belt pulleys--was the ease\nwith which the steam could be conveyed into intricate parts of the\nbuilding.  The pipes which I used were of wrought-iron, similar to\nthose used in conveying gas.  They could be curved to suit any\npeculiarity of the situation; and when the pipes were lapped with felt,\nor enclosed in wooden troughs filled with sawdust, the loss of heat by\nradiation was reduced to a minimum.  The loss of power was certainly\nmuch less than in the friction of a long and perhaps tortuous line of\nshafting.  With steam of 50 lbs. to the inch, a pipe of one-inch bore\nwill convey sufficient steam to give forth five horse-power at a\ndistance of two or three hundred feet from the boiler.*\n [footnote...\nIn the case of rambling premises, such as iron shipbuilding yards,\nthe conveyance of steam by well-protected pipes put underground for the\npurpose of driving engines to work punching and plate-shearing machines\n(which have to be near at hand when the work is required), has very\ngreat practical advantages.\n ...]\n\nI adopted the same practice in working the refined and complex machines\nused in printing coloured patterns on calico.  A great variety of\ncolours has to be transferred by a combination of rollers--each carrying\nits proper colour; these are printed on the calico with the utmost\nexactness, and result in the complete pattern.  My system of having a\nseparate engine to give motion to these colour-printing machines was\nfound to be of great service, and its value was recognised by its\nspeedy and almost universal adoption. Every connection with the main\nshaft, with its gearing and belts and pulleys--by which colour-printing\nhad before been accomplished--was entirely done away with, because each\nmachine had its own special engine.  The former practice had led to\nmuch waste, and the printing was often confused and badly done.\nThe power was conveyed from a great central steam-engine; the printing\nmachines were ranged by the side of a long gallery, and by means of a\n\"clutch\" each machine was started at once into action.\n\nThe result of this was a considerable shock to the machine,\nand an interference with the relative adjustments of the six or\neight colour rollers, which were often jerked out of their exact\nrelative adjustment.  Then the machines had to be stopped and the\nrollers readjusted, and sometimes many yards of calico had been spoiled\nbefore this could be done.\n\nThese difficulties were now entirely removed.  When all was adjusted,\nthe attendant of the print-machine had only to open gradually the steam\nadmission valve of his engine, and allow it to work the machine gently\nat its first off-go; and when all was seen to be acting in perfect\nconcert, to open the valve further and allow the machine to go at full\nspeed.  The same practice was adopted in slowing off the machine,\nso as to allow the attendant to scrutinise the pattern and the position\nof the work, or in stopping the machine altogether.  So satisfactory\nwere the results of the application of this mode of driving calico\nprinting machines, that it was adopted for the like processes as\napplied to other textile fabrics; and it is now, I believe, universally\napplied at home as well as abroad.  I may also add that the waste\nsteam, as it issued from the engine after performing its mechanical\nduty there, was utilised in a most effective manner by heating a series\nof steam-tight cylinders, over which the printed cloth travelled as it\nissued from the printing machine, when it was speedily and effectively\ndried.  In these various improvements in calico printing I was most\nably seconded by Mr. Joseph Lese, of Manchester, whose practical\nacquaintance with all that related to that department of industry\nrendered him of the greatest service.  There was no \"Invention,\"\nso to speak, in this almost obvious application of the steam-engine to\ncalico-printing.  It required merely the faculty of observation, and\nthe application of means to ends.  The main feature of the system,\nit will be observed, was in enabling the superintendent of each machine\nto have perfect control over it,--to set it in motion and to regulate\nits speed without the slightest jerk or shock to its intricate\nmechanism.  In this sense the arrangement was of great commercial value.\n\nI had another opportunity of introducing my small engine system into\nthe Government Arsenal at Woolwich.  In 1847 the attention of the Board\nof Ordnance was, directed to the inadequacy of the equipment of the\nworkshops there.  The mechanical arrangements, the machine tools,\nand other appliances, were found insufficient for the economical\nproduction of the apparatus of modern warfare.  The Board did me the\nhonour to call upon me to advise with them, and also with the heads of\ndepartments at the arsenal.  Sir Thomas Hastings, then head of the\nOrdnance, requested me to accompany him at the first inspection.\nI made a careful survey of all the workshops, and although the\nmachinery was very interesting as examples of the old and primitive\nmethods of producing war material, I found that it was better fitted\nfor a Museum of Technical Antiquity than for practical use in these\ndays of rapid mechanical progress.  Everything was certainly far behind\nthe arrangements which I had observed in foreign arsenals.\nThe immediate result of my inspection of the workshops and the\nprocesses conducted within them was, that I recommended the\nintroduction of machine tools specially adapted to economise labour,\nas well as to perfect the rapid production of war material.\nIn this I was heartily supported by the heads of the various departments.\nAfter several conferences with them, as well as with Sir Thomas Hastings,\nit was arranged that a large extension of the workshop space should be\nprovided.  I was so fortunate as to make a happy suggestion on this\nhead.  It was, that by a very small comparative outlay nearly double\nthe workshop area might be provided--by covering in with light iron\nroofs the long wide roadway spaces that divided the parallel ranges of\nworkshops from each other.\n\nThis plan was at once adopted.  Messrs. Fox and Henderson,\nthe well-known railway roofing contractors, were entrusted with the\norder; and in a very short time the arsenal was provided with a noble\nset of light and airy workshops, giving ample accommodation for present\nrequirements, as well as surplus space for many years to come.\nIn order to supply steam power to each of these beautiful workshops,\nand for working the various machines placed within them, I reverted to\nmy favourite system of small separate steam-engines.  This was adopted,\nand the costly ranges of shafting that would otherwise have been\nnecessary were entirely dispensed with.\n\nA series of machine tools of the most improved modern construction,\nspecially adapted for the various classes of work carried on in the\narsenal, together with improved ranges of smiths' forge hearths,\nblown by an air blast supplied by fans of the best construction, and a\nsuitable supply of small hand steam hammers, completed the arrangements;\nand quite a new era in the forge work of the arsenal was begun.\nI showed the managers and the workmen the docile powers of the steam\nhammer, in producing in a few minutes, by the aid of dies, many forms\nin wrought-iron that had heretofore occupied hours of the most skilful\nsmiths, and that, too, in much more perfect truth and exactitude.\nBoth masters and men were delighted with the result:  and as such\nprecise and often complex forms of wrought-iron work were frequently\nrequired by hundreds at a time for the equipment of naval gun carriages\nand other purposes, it was seen that the steam hammer must henceforward\noperate as a powerful auxiliary in the productions of the arsenal.\n\nIn the introduction of all these improvements I received the frank and\ncordial encouragement of the chief officers of the Board of Ordnance\nand Admiralty.  My suggestions were zealously carried out by\nColonel J. N. Colquhoun, then head of the chief mechanical department\nof the Ordnance works at Woolwich.  He was one of the most clear-headed\nand intelligent men I have ever met with.  He had in a special degree\nthat happy power of inspiring his zeal and energy into all who worked\nunder his superintendence, whether foremen or workmen. A wonderfully\nsympathetic effect is produced when the directing head of the\nestablishment is possessed of the valuable faculty of cheerful and\nwell-directed energy.  It works like an electric thrill, and soon\npervades the whole department.  I may also mention General Dundas,\ndirector of the Royal Gun-Factory, and General Hardinge, head of the\nRoyal Laboratories.*\n [footnote...\nThe term \"Laboratory\" may appear an odd word to use in connection with\nmachinery and mechanical operations.  Yet its original signification\nwas quite appropriate, inasmuch as it related to the preparation of\nexplosive substances, such as shells, rockets, fusees, cartridges,\nand percussion caps, where chemistry was as much concerned as mechanism\nin producing the required results.\n ...]\n\nThis latter department included all processes connected with explosives.\nIt was superintended by Captain Boxer, an officer of the highest talent\nand energy, who brought everything under his control to the highest\npitch of excellence.  I must also add a most important person,\nmy old and much esteemed friend John Anderson, then general director of\nthe Machinery of the arsenal.  He was an admirable mechanic, a man of\nclear practical good sense and judgment, and he eventually raised\nhimself to the highest position in the public service.\n\nThe satisfactory performance of the machinery which had been supplied\nto the workshops of the royal dock yards and arsenals, led to further\ndemands for similar machinery for foreign Governments.  Foreign visitor\nwere allowed freely to inspect all that had been done whatever may be\nsaid of the wisdom of this proceeding it is certainly true that no\nmechanical improvement can long be kept secret nowadays. Everything is\npublished and illustrated in our engineering journals. And if the\nforeigners had not been allowed to obtain their new machines from\nEngland, they were provided with facilities enough for constructing\nthem for themselves.  At all events, one result of the improved working\nof the new machines at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, was the receipt\nof large orders for our firm for the supply of foreign Governments.\nFor instance, that of Spain employed us liberally, principally tor the\nequipment of the royal dockyards of Ferrol and Cartagena.\nThese orders came to us through Messrs. Zuluatta Brothers,\nwho conducted their proceedings with us in a prompt and business-like\nway for many years.  Through the same firm we obtained orders to\nfurnish machinery for the Spanish royal dockyard at Havana.\n\nIn 1849 we received an extensive order from the Russian Government.\nThis was transmitted to us through the Imperial Consulate in London.\nThe machinery was required for the equipment of a very extensive rope\nfactory at the naval arsenal of Nicolaiev, on the Black Sea This order\nincluded all the machinery requisite for the factory, from the heckling\nof the hemp to the twisting of the largest ropes and cables required in\nthe Russian naval service.  The design and organisation of this machinery\nin its minutest detail caused me to made a special study of the art of\nrope-making.  It was a comparatively new subject to me; but I found it\nfull of interest.  It was difficulty, and therefore to be overcome.\nAnd in this lies a great deal of the pleasure of contriving and\ninventing.\n\nDuring the progress of the work I had the advantage of the frequent\npresence of an able Russian officer, Captain Putchkraskey,\nwhose intelligent supervision was a source of much satisfaction.\nWe had also occasional visits from Admiral Kornileff, a man of the\nhighest order of intelligence.  He was not only able to appreciate our\nexertions to execute the order in first-rate style, but to enter into\nall the special details and contrivances of the work while in progress.\nI had often occasion to meet Russian officers while at the Bridgewater\nFoundry.  They were usually men of much ability, selected by the\nRussian Government to act as their agents abroad, in order to keep them\nwell posted up in all that had a bearing upon their own interests.\nThey certainly reflected the highest credit on their Government,\nas proving their careful selection of the best men to advance the\ninterests of Russia.\n\nDuring the visit of the Grand Duke Constantine to England about that\ntime, he resided for some days with the Earl of Ellesmere at\nWorsley Hall, about a mile and a half from Bridgewater Foundry.\nWe were favoured with several visits from the Grand Duke, accompanied\nby Baron Brunnow, Admiral Hoyden, and several other Russian officials.\nThey came by Lord Ellesmere's beautiful barge, which drew up alongside\nour wharf, where the party landed and entered the works. The Grand Duke\ncarefully inspected the whole place, and expressed himself as greatly\npleased with the complete mastery which man had obtained over obdurate\nmaterials, through the unfailing agency of mechanical substitutes for\nmanual dexterity and muscular force.\n\nI was invited to meet this distinguished party at Worsley Hall on more\nthan one occasion, and was much pleased with the frank and intelligent\nconversation of the Grand Duke, in his reference to what he had seen in\nhis visits to our works.  It was always a source of high pleasure to me\nto receive visits from Lord Ellesmere, as he was generally accompanied\nby men of distinction who were well able to appreciate the importance\nof what had been displayed before them.  The visits, for instance,\nof Rajah Brooke, the Earl of Elgin, the Duke of Argyll, Chevalier Bunsen,\nand Count Flahault, stand out bright in my memory.\n\nBut to return to my rope-making machinery.  It was finished to the\nsatisfaction of the Russian officers.  It was sent off by ship to the\nBlack Sea in July 1851, and fitted up at Nicolaiev shortly after.\nI received a kind and pressing invitation from Admiral Kornileff to\naccompany him on the first trip of a magnificent steamer which had been\nconstructed in England under his supervision.  His object was, not only\nthat I might have a pleasant voyage in his company, but that I might\nsee my machinery in full action at Nicolaiev, and also that I might\nmake a personal survey of the arsenal workshops at Sebastopol.\nIt would, no doubt, have been a delightful trip, but it was not to be.\nThe unfortunate disruption occurred between our Government and that of\nRussia, which culminated in the disastrous Crimean War.\nOne of the first victims was Admiral Kornileff.  He was killed by one\nof our first shots while engaged in placing some guns for the defence\nof the entrance to the harbour of Sebastopol.\n\n\nCHAPTER 18.  Astronomical pursuits.\n\nLet me turn for a time from the Foundry, the whirr of the self-acting\ntools, and the sound of the steam hammers, to my quieter pursuits at home.\nThere I had much tranquil enjoyment in the company of my dear wife.\nI had many hobbies.  Drawing was as familiar to me as language.\nIndeed, it was often my method of speaking.  It has always been the way\nin which I have illustrated my thoughts.  In the course of my journeys\nat home and abroad I made many drawings of places and objects, which\nwere always full of interest, to me at least; and they never ceased to\nbring up a store of happy remembrances.\n\nNow and then I drew upon my fancy, and with pen and ink I conjured up\n\"The Castle of Udolpho,\" \" A Bit of Old England,\" \"The Fairies are Out,\"\nand \"Everybody for Ever.\"  The last is crowded with thousands of figures\nand heads, so that it is almost impossible to condense the drawing into\na small compass.  To these I added \"The Alchemist,\" \"Old Mortality,\"\n\"Robinson Crusoe,\" and a bit of English scenery, which I called\n\"Gathering Sticks.\"  I need not say with how much pleasure I executed\nthese drawings in my evening hours.  They were not \"published,\" but I\ndrew them with lithographic ink, and had them printed by Mr. Maclure.\nI afterwards made presents of the series to some of my most intimate\nfriends.\n\n[Image]  The Antiquarian.  By James Nasmyth (Facsimile)\n\nIn remembrance of the great pleasure which I had derived from the\nperusal of Washington Irving's fascinating works, I sent him a copy of\nmy sketches.  His answer was charming and characteristic.\nHis letter was dated \" Sunnyside,\" Massachusetts, where he lived.\nHe said (17th January 1859):\n\nDEAR SIR--Accept my most sincere and hearty thanks for the exquisite\nfancy sketches which you have had the kindness to send me, and for the\nexpressions of esteem and regard in the letter which accompanied them.\nIt is indeed a heartfelt gratification to me to think that I have been\nable by any exercise of my pen to awaken such warm and delicate\nsympathies, and to call forth such testimonials of pleasure and\napprobation from a person of your cultivated taste and intellectual\nelevation.  With high respect and regard, I remain, nay dear sir,\nyour truly obliged friend, Washington Irving.\"\n\n[Image]  The Fairies.  By James Nasmyth.  (Facsimile)\n\nViscount Duncan, afterwards Earl Camperdown, also acknowledged receipt\nof the drawings in a characteristic letter.  He said: --\"We are quite\ndelighted with them, especially with 'The Fairies,' which a lady to\nwhom I showed them very nearly stole, as she declared that it quite\nrealised her dreams of fairyland.  I am only surprised that amidst your\nnumerous avocations you have found time to execute such detailed works\nof art; and I shall have much pleasure in being reminded as I look at\nthe drawings that the same hand and head that executed them invented\nthe steam hammer, and many other gigantic pieces of machinery which\nwill tend to immortalise the Anglo-saxon race.\"\n\nBut my most favourite pursuit, after my daily exertions at the Foundry,\nwas Astronomy.  There were frequently clear nights when the glorious\nobjects in the Heavens were seen in most attractive beauty and brilliancy.\n\nI cannot find words to express the thoughts which the impressive\ngrandeur of the Stars, seen in the silence of the night, suggested to\nme; especially when I directed my Telescope, even at random,\non any portion of the clear sky, and considered that each Star of the\nmultitude it revealed to me, was a SUN! the centre of a system!\nMyriads of such stars, invisible to the unassisted eye, were rendered\nperfectly distinct by the aid of the telescope.  The magnificence of\nthe sight was vastly increased when the telescope was directed to any\nportion of the Milky Way.  It revealed such countless multitudes of\nstars that I had only to sit before the eyepiece, and behold the\nendless procession of these glorious objects pass before me.\nThe motion of the earth assisted in changing this scene of\ninexpressible magnificence, which reached its climax when some object\nsuch as the \"Cluster in Hercules\" came into sight.  The component stars\nare so crowded together there as to give the cluster the appearance of\na gray spot; but when examined with a telescope of large aperture,\nit becomes resolved into such myriads of stars as to defy all attempts\nto count them.  Nothing can convey to the mind, in so awful and\nimpressive a manner, the magnificent and infinite extent of Creation,\nand the inconceivable power of its Creator!\n\nI had already a slight acquaintance with Astronomy.  My father had\nimplanted in me the first germs.  He was a great admirer of that\nsublimest of sciences.  I had obtained a sufficient amount of technical\nknowledge to construct in 1827 a small but very effective reflecting\ntelescope of six inches diameter.  Three years later I initiated\nMr. Maudslay into the art and mystery of making a reflecting telescope.\nI then made a speculum of ten inches diameter, and but for the unhappy\ncircumstance of his death in 1831, it would have been mounted in his\nproposed observatory at Norwood.  After I had settled down at Fireside,\nPatricroft, I desired to possess a telescope of considerable power in\norder to enjoy the tranquil pleasure of surveying the heavens in their\nimpressive grandeur at night.\n\nAs I had all the means and appliances for casting specula at the\nfactory, I soon had the felicity of embodying all my former\nself-acquired skill in this fine art by producing a very perfect\ncasting of a ten-inch diameter speculum.  The alloy consisted of\nfifteen parts of pure tin and thirty-two parts of pure copper,\nwith one part of arsenic.  It was cast with perfect soundness, and was\nground and polished by a machine which I contrived for the purpose.\nThe speculum was so brilliant that when my friend William Lassell saw it,\nhe said \"it made his mouth water.\"  It was about this time (1840) that I\nhad the great happiness of becoming acquainted with Mr. Lassell,*\n [footnote...\nMr. Lassell was a man of superb powers.  Like many others who have done\nso much for astronomy, he started as an amateur. He was first\napprenticed to a merchant at Liverpool.  He then began business as a\nbrewer.  Eventually he devoted himself to astronomy and astronomical\nmechanics.  When in his twenty-first year he began constructing\nreflecting telescopes for himself.  He proceeded to make a Newtonian of\nnine inches aperture, which he erected in an observatory at his\nresidence near Liverpool, happily named \"Starfield.\"\nWith this instrument he worked diligently, and detected the sixth star\nin the trapezium of Orion.  In 1844 he conceived the bold idea of\nconstructing a reflector of two feet aperture, and twenty feet focal\nlength, to be mounted equatorially.  Sir John Herschel, in mentioning\nMr. Lassell's work, did me the honour of saying \"that in Mr Nasmyth he\nwas fortunate to find a mechanist capable of executing in the highest\nperfection all his conceptions, and prepared by his own love of\nastronomy and practical acquaintance with astronomical observations,\nand with the construction of specula, to give them their full effect.\"\nWith this fine instrument Mr. Lassell discovered the satellite of\nNeptune.  He also discovered the eighth satellite of Saturn, of extreme\nminuteness, as well as two additional satellites of Uranus.\nBut perhaps his best work was done at Malta with a much larger\ntelescope, four feet in aperture, and thirty-seven feet focus, erected\nthere in 1861.  He remained at Malta for three years, and published a\ncatalogue of 600 new nebulae, which will be found in the Memoirs of the\nRoyal Astronomical Society.  One of his curious sayings was,\n\"I have had a great deal to do with opticians,\nsome of them--like Cooke of York--are really opticians;\nbut the greater number of them are merely shopticians!\"\n ...]\nand profiting by his devotion to astronomical pursuits and his profound\nknowledge of the subject.  He had acquired much technical skill in the\nconstruction of reflecting telescopes, and the companionship between us\nwas thus rendered very agreeable.  There was an intimate exchange of\nopinions on the subject, and my friendship with him continued during\nforty successive years.  I was perhaps a little ahead of him in certain\nrespects.  I had more practical knowledge of casting, for I had begun\nwhen a boy in my bedroom at Edinburgh.  In course of time I contrived\nmany practical \"dodges\" (if I may use such a word), and could nimbly\nvault over difficulties of a special kind which had hitherto formed a\nbarrier in the way of amateur speculum makers when fighting their way\nto a home-made telescope.  I may mention that I know of no mechanical\npursuit in connection with science, that offers such an opportunity for\npractising the technical arts, as that of constructing from first to\nlast a complete Newtonian or Gregorian Reflecting Telescope.\nSuch an enterprise brings before the amateur a succession of the most\ninteresting and instructive mechanical arts, and obliges the\nexperimenter to exercise the faculty of delicate manipulation.\nIf I were asked what course of practice was the best to instil a true\ntaste for refined mechanical work, I should say, set to and make for\nyourself from first to last a reflecting telescope with a metallic\nspeculum.  Buy nothing but the raw material, and work your way to the\npossession of a telescope by means of your own individual labour and\nskill.  If you do your work with the care, intelligence, and patience\nthat is necessary, you will find a glorious reward in the enhanced\nenjoyment of a night with the heavens--all the result of your own\ningenuity and handiwork.  It will prove a source of abundant pleasure\nand of infinite enjoyment for the rest of your life.\n\nI well remember the visit I received from my dear friend Warren de la Rue\nin the year 1840.  I was executing some work for him with respect to a\nnew process which he had contrived for the production of white lead.\nI was then busy with the casting of my thirteen-inch speculum.\nHe watched my proceedings with earnest interest and most careful\nattention.  He told me many years after, that it was the sight of my\nspecial process of casting a sound speculum that in a manner caused him\nto turn his thoughts to practical astronomy, a subject in which he has\nexhibited such noble devotion as well as masterly skill.  Soon after\nhis visit I had the honour of casting for him a thirteen-inch speculum,\nwhich he afterwards ground and polished by a method of his own.\nHe mounted it in an equatorial instrument of such surpassing excellence\nas enabled him, aided by his devotion and pure love of the subject,\nto record a series of observations and results which will hand his name\ndown to posterity as one of the most faithful and patient of\nastronomical observers.\n\n[Image]  Fireside, Patricroft.  After a drawing by James Nasmyth\n\nBut to return to my own little work at Patricroft.  I mounted my\nten-inch home-made reflecting telescope, and began my survey of the\nheavens.  Need I say with what exquisite delight the harmony of their\nsplendour filled me.  I began as a learner, and my learning grew with\nexperience.  There were the prominent stars, the planets, the Milky Way\n--with thousands of far-off suns--to be seen.  My observations were\nat first merely general; by degrees they became particular.\nI was not satisfied with enjoying these sights myself;\nI made my friends and neighbours sharers in my pleasure;\nand some of them enjoyed the wonders of the heavens as much as I did.\n\nIn my early use of the telescope I had fitted the speculum into a light\nsquare tube of deal to which the eye-piece was attached, so as to have\nall the essential parts of the telescope combined together in the most\nsimple and portable form.  I had often to remove it from place to place\nin my small garden at the side of the Bridgewater Canal, in order to\nget it clear of the trees and branches which intercepted some object in\nthe heavens which I wished to see.  How eager and enthusiastic I was in\nthose days!  Sometimes I got out of bed in the clear small hours of the\nmorning, and went down to the garden in my night-shirt.  I would take\nthe telescope in my arms and plant it in some suitable spot, where I\nmight get a peep at some special planet or star then above the horizon.\n\nIt became bruited about that a ghost was seen at Patricroft!\nA barge was silently gliding along the canal near midnight,\nwhen the boatman suddenly saw a figure in white.\n\"It moved among the trees with a coffin in its arms!\"\nThe apparition was so sudden and strange that he immediately concluded\nthat it was a ghost.  The weird sight was reported at the stations\nalong the canal, and also at Wolverhampton, which was the boatman's\nheadquarters.  He told the people at Patricroft on his return journey\nwhat he had seen, and great was the excitement produced.  The place was\nhaunted:  there was no doubt about it!  After all, the rumour was\nfounded on fact, for the ghost was merely myself in my night-shirt,\nand the coffin was my telescope, which I was quietly shifting from one\nplace to another in order to get a clearer sight of the heavens at\nmidnight.\n\nMy ambition expanded.  I now resolved to construct a reflecting\ntelescope of considerably greater power than that which I possessed.\nI made one of twenty inches diameter, and mounted it on a very simple\nplan, thus removing many of the inconveniences and even personal risks\nthat attend the use of such instruments.  (For illustration of the plan\nof mounting a large telescope, see p. 338) It had been necessary to\nmount steps or ladders to get at the eyepiece, especially when the\nobjects to be observed were at a high elevation above the horizon.\nI now prepared to do some special work with this instrument.\nIn 1842 I began my systematic researches upon the Moon.  I carefully\nand minutely scrutinised the marvellous details of its surface,\na pursuit which I continued for many years, and still continue with\nardour until this day.  My method was as follows: --\n\nI availed myself of every favourable opportunity for carrying on the\ninvestigation.  I made careful drawings with black and white chalk on\nlarge sheets of grey-tinted paper, of such selected portions of the\nMoon as embodied the most characteristic and instructive features of\nher wonderful surface.  I was thus enabled to graphically represent the\ndetails with due fidelity as to form, as well as with regard to the\nstriking effect of the original in its masses of light and shade.\nI thus educated my eye for the special object by systematic and careful\nobservation, and at the same time practised my hand in no less careful\ndelineation of all that was so distinctly presented to me by the\ntelescope--at the side of which my sheet of paper was handily fixed.\nI became in a manner familiar with the vast variety of those distinct\nmanifestations of volcanic action, which at some inconceivably remote\nperiod had produced these wonderful features and details of the moon's\nsurface.  So far as could be observed, there was an entire absence of\nany agency of change, so that their formation must have remained\nabsolutely intact since the original cosmical heat of the moon had\npassed rapidly into space.  The surface, with all its wondrous details,\npresents the same aspect as it did probably millions of ages ago.\n\nThis consideration vastly enhances the deep interest with which we look\nupon the moon and its volcanic details.  It is totally without an\natmosphere, or of a vapour envelope, such as the earth possesses,\nand which must have contributed to the conservation of the cosmical\nheat of the latter orb.  The moon is of relatively small mass,\nand is consequently inferior in heat-retaining power.  It must thus\nhave parted with its original stock of cosmical heat with such rapidity\nas to bring about the final termination of those surface changes which\ngive it so peculiar an aspect.  In the case of the earth the internal\nheat still continues in operation, though in a vastly reduced degree of\nactivity.  Again in the case of the moon, the total absence of water as\nwell as atmosphere has removed from it all those denudative activities\nwhich, in the earth, have acted so powerfully in effecting changes of\nits surfaces as well as in the distribution of its materials.\nHence the appearance of the wonderful details of the moon's surface\npresents us with objects of inconceivably remote antiquity.\n\n[Image]  General structure of Lunar craters.\n\nAnother striking characteristic of the moon's surface is the enormous\nmagnitude of its volcanic crater formations.  In comparison with these,\nthe greatest on the surface of the earth are reduced to insignificance.\nParadoxical as the statement may at first appear, the magnitude of the\nremains of the primitive volcanic energy in the moon is simply due to\nthe smallness of its mass.  Being only about one-eightieth part of the\nbulk of the earth, the force of gravity on the moon's surface is only\nabout one-sixth.  And as eruptive force is quite independent,\nas a force, of the law of gravitation, and as it acted with its full\nenergy on matter, which in the moon is little heavier than cork,\nit was dispersed in divergent flight from the vent of the volcanoes,\nfree from any atmospheric resistance, and thus secured an enormously\nwider dispersion of the ejected scoriae.  Hence the building up of\nthose enormous ring-formed craters which are seen in such vast numbers\non the moon's surface--some of them being no less than a hundred\nmiles in diameter, with which those of Etna and Vesuvius are the merest\nmolehills in comparison.\n\nI may mention, in passing, that the frequency of a central cone within\nthese ring-shaped lunar craters supplies us with one of the most\ndistinct and unquestionable evidences of the true nature and mode of\nthe formation of volcanoes.\n\nThey are the result of the expiring energy of the volcanic discharge,\nwhich, when near its termination, not having sufficient energy to eject\nthe matter far from its vent, becomes deposited around it, and thus\nbuilds up the central cone as a sort of monument to commemorate its\nexpiring efforts.  In this way it recalls the exact features of our own\nterrestrial craters, though the latter are infinitely smaller in\ncomparison.  When we consider how volcanoes are formed--\nby the ejection and exudation of material from beneath the solid crust--\nit will be seen how the lunar eminences are formed; that is, by the\nforcible projection of fluid molten matter through cracks or vents,\nthrough which it makes its way to the surface.\n\n[Image]  Pico, an isolated Lunar Mountain 8000 feet high.\n\nIt was in reference to this very interesting subject that I made a\ndrawing of the great isolated volcanic mountain Pico, about 8000 feet\nhigh.*\n [footnote...\nthis illustration exhibits a class of volcanic formations that may be\nseen on many portions of the moon's surface.  They are what I would\nterm exudative volcanic mountains, the results of a comparatively\ngentle discharge of volcanic matter, which has resulted in heaped up\neminences; a vast group of which were displayed in the illustration,\nsome of them being upwards of 20,000 feet high.\n ...]\n\nIt exhibits a very different appearance from that of our mountain\nranges, which are for the most part the result of a tangential action.\nIn the case of the earth, the hard stratified crust had to adapt itself\nto the shrunken diameter of the once much hotter globe. This tangential\naction is illustrated in our own persons, when age causes the body to\nshrink in bulk, while the skin, which does not shrink to the same\nextent, has to accommodate itself to the shrunken interior, and so\nforms wrinkles--the wrinkles of age.  This theory opens up a chapter\nin geology and physiology well worthy of consideration.  It may alike\nbe seen in the structure of the surface of the earth, in an old apple,\nand in an old hand.*\n [footnote...\nThe shrunken hand on the other side is that of Mr. Nasmyth,\nphotographed by himself.  According to The Psychonomy of the Hand,\nby R.  Beamish, F.R.S., author of The Life of Sir M. I. Brunel,\nit exhibits a thoroughly mechanical hand, as well as the hand of a\ndelicate manipulator; illustrating that remarkable expression in the\nBook of Job, that \"in the hand of all the sons of men God places marks,\nthat all the sons of men may know their own works.\"--ED.\n ...]\n\n[Image]  Shrunken Apple and Hand.*\n [footnote...\nThese illustrations serve to illustrate one of the most potent of\ngeological agencies which has given the earth's surface its grandest\ncharacteristics.  I mean the elevation of mountain ranges through the\ncontraction of the globe as a whole.  By the action of gravity the\nformer larger surface crushes down, as it were, the contracting\ninterior; and the superfluous matter, which belonged to a bigger globe,\narranges itself by tangential displacement, and accommodates itself to\nthe altered or decreased size of the globe. Hence our mountain ranges,\nwhich though apparently enormous when seen near at hand are merely the\nwrinkles on the face of the earth.\n ...]\n\nWhile earnestly studying the details of the moon's surface, it was a\nsource of great additional interest to me to endeavour to realise in\nthe mind's eye the possible landscape effect of its marvellous\nelevations and depressions.  Here my artisic faculty came into\noperation.  I endeavoured to illustrate the landscape.  scenery of the\nMoon, in like manner as we illustrate the landscape scenery of the\nEarth.  The telescope revealed to me distinctly the volcanic craters,\nthe cracks, and the ranges of mountains--by means of the light and\nshade on the moon's surface.  One of the most prominent conditions of\nthe awful grandeur of lunar scenery is the brilliant light of the sun,\nfar transcending that which we experience upon the earth--enhanced by\nthe contrast with the jet-black background of the lunar heavens,--\nthe result of the total absence of atmosphere.  One portion of the\nmoon, on which the sun is shining, is brilliantly illuminated,\nwhile all in shade is dark.\n\nWhile the disc of the sun appears a vast electric light of overpowering\nrayless brilliancy, every star and planet in the black vault of the\nlunar heavens is shining with steady brightness at all times;\nas, whether the Sun be present or absent during the long fourteen days'\nlength of the lunar day or night, no difference on the absolutely black\naspect of the lunar heavens can appear.  That aspect must be eternal\nthere.  No modification*\n [footnote...\na small degree of illumination is, however, given to some portions of\nthe Moon's surface by the Earth-shine, when the earth is in such a\nposition with regard to the Moon, as to reflect some light on to it,\nas the Moon does to the earth.\n ...]\nof the darkness of shadows in the Moon can result from the illuminative\neffect, as in our case in the earth, from light reflected into shadows\nby the blue sky of our earthly day The intensity of the contrast\nbetween light and shade must thus lend another awful aspect to the\nscenery of the Moon, while deprived of all those charming effects which\nartists term \"aerial perspective,\" by which relative distances are\nrendered cognisable with such tender and exquisite beauty.  The absence\nof atmosphere on the Moon causes the most distant objects to appear as\nclose as the nearest; while the comparatively rapid curvature of the\nmoon, owing to its being a globe only one-fourth the diameter of the\nearth, must necessarily limit very considerably the range of view.\n\n[Image]  Lunar Mountains and Extinct Volcanic Craters\n\nIt is the combination of all these circumstances, which we know with\nabsolute certainty must exist in the Moon, that gives to the\ncontemplation of her marvellous surface, as revealed by the aid of\npowerful telescopes,--one of the grandest and most deeply interesting\nsubjects that can occupy our thoughts; especially when we regard the\nphysical constitution and the peculiar structure of her surface,\nas that of our nearest planetary neighbour, and also as our serviceable\nattendant by night.\n\nThen there are the Tides, so useful to man, preserving the sanitary\ncondition of the river mouths and tide-swept shores.\nWe must be grateful for the Moon's existence on that account alone.\nShe is the grand scavenger and practical sanitary commissioner of the\nearth. Then consider the work she does!  She moves hundreds of ships and\nbarges, filled with valuable cargoes, up our tidal rivers,\nto the commercial cities on their banks.  She thus performs a vast\namount of daily and nightly mechanical drudgery.  She is the most\neffective of all Tugs; and now that we understand the convertibility\nand conservation of force, we may be able to use her Tide-producing\npowers through the agency of electricity for mechanical purposes.\nIt is even possible that the Tides may yet light our streets and\nhouses!*\n [footnote...\nIt is not quite a century since London was in part supplied with water\nby the Moon, through employing the tidal action by the waters at\nOld London Bridge, where the tide mills worked the water-supplying pumps.\n ...]\n\nIs the moon inhabited?  It seems to me that the entire absence of\natmosphere and water forbids the supposition--at least of any form of\nlife with which we are acquainted.  Add to this adverse condition,\nthe fact of the moon's day being equal to fourteen of our days;\nthe sun shining with much more brilliancy of effect in the moon than on\nthe earth, where atmosphere and moisture act as an important agent in\nmodifying its scorching rays; whilst no such agency exists in the moon.\nThe sun shines there without intermission for fourteen days and nights.\nDuring that time the heat must accumulate to almost the melting point\nof lead; while, on the other hand, the absence of the sun for an equal\nperiod must be followed by a period of intense cold, such as we have no\nexperience of, even in the Arctic regions.  The highest authorities\nstate that the cold during the Moon's long night must reach as low as\n250 degrees below the freezing point of water.  These considerations,\nI think, reasonably suggest that the existence of any form of life in\nthe Moon is in the highest degree improbable.\n\nThe first occasion on which I exhibited my series of drawings of the\nMoon, together with a map six feet in diameter of its entire visible\nsurface, was at the meeting of the British Association at Edinburgh in\n1850.  I always looked forward to these meetings with great pleasure,\nand attended them with supreme interest.  My dear wife always\naccompanied me.  It was our scientific holiday.  It was also our\nholiday of friendship.  We met many of our old friends, and made many\nnew friends.  Alas, how many of them have departed!  Herschel, Faraday,\nRobinson, Taylor, Phillips, Brewster, Rosse, Fairbairn, Lassell,\nand a host of minor stars, who, although perhaps wanting in the\nbrightness or magnitude of those I have named, made good amends by the\nwarmth of their cheerful rays.  We saw the younger lights emerging\nabove the horizon:  the men who still continue to shed their glory over\nthe meetings of the Association.\n\nHow delightful was our visit to Edinburgh in 1850. It was\n\"mine own romantic town.\"  I remembered its striking features so well.\nThere was the broad mass of the Old Town, with its endless diversity of\nlight and shade.  There was the grand old fortress, with its towers and\nturrets and black portholes.  Towards evening the distant glories of\nthe departing sun threw forward, in dark outline, the wooded hill of\nCorstorphine.  The rock and Castle assumed a new aspect every time I\nlooked at them.  The long-drawn gardens filling the valley between the\nOld Town and the New, and the thickly-wooded scars of the Castle rock,\nwere a charm of landscape and a charm of art.  Arthur's Seat, like a\nlion at rest, seemed perfect witchcraft.  And from the streets in the\nNew Town, or from Calton Hill, what singular glances of beauty were\nobserved in the distance--the gleaming waters of the Firth,\nand the blue shadows among the hills of Fife.\n\nI remembered it all, from the days in which I sat, as a child, beside\nthe lassies watching the \"claes\" on the Calton Hill and hearing the\nchimes of St. Giles's tinkling across the Nor' Loch from the Old Town;\nthe walks, when a boy, in the picturesque country round Edinburgh,\nwith my father and his scientific and artistic friends; my days at the\nHigh School, and then my evenings at the School of Arts; my castings of\nbrass in my bedroom, and the technical training I enjoyed in the\nworkshop of my old schoolfellow; my roadway locomotive and its success;\nand finally, the making of my tools and machines intended for Manchester,\nat the foundry of my dear old friend Douglass.  It all came back to me\nlike a dream.  And now, after some twenty years, I had returned to\nEdinburgh on a visit to the British Association.  Many things had been\nchanged--many relatives and friends had departed--but still Edinburgh\nremained to me as fascinating as ever.\n\nThe excursions formed our principal source of enjoyment during these\nscientific gatherings.  The season was then at its happiest.\nNature was in her most enjoyable condition, and the excursionists were\nusually in their holiday mood.  The meeting of the British Association\nat Edinburgh was presided over by Sir David Brewster.  The geologists\nvisited the remarkable displays of volcanic phenomena with which the\nneighbourhood of Edinburgh singularly abounds.  Indeed, Edinburgh owes\nmuch of its picturesque beauty to volcanoes and earthquake upheavings.\nOur excursions culminated in a visit to the Bass Rock. The excursion\nhad been carefully planned, and was successfully carried out.\nThe day was beautiful, and the party was of the choicest.\nAfter reaching the little cove of Canty Bay, overlooked by the gigantic\nruins of Tantallon Castle, we were ferried across to the Bass;\nthrough a few miles of that capricious sea, the Firth of Forth, near to\nwhere it joins the German Ocean.  We were piloted by that fine old\nBritish tar, Admiral Malcolm, while the commissariat was superintended\nby General Pasley.\n\nWe were safely landed on that magnificent sea-girt volcanic rock--\nthe Bass.  After inspecting the ruins of what was once a castellated\nState prison, where the Covenanters were immured for conscience' sake,\nwe wandered up the hill towards the summit.  There we were treated\nto a short lecture by Professor Owen on the Solan Goose,\nwhich was illustrated by the clouds of geese flying over us.\nThey freely exhibited their habits on land as well as in mid-air,\nand skimmed the dizzy crags with graceful and apparently effortless\nmotions. The vast variety of seafowl screamed their utmost,\nand gave a wonderfully illustrative chorus to the lecture.\nIt was a most impressive scene.  We were high above the deep blue sea of\nthe German Ocean, the waves of which leapt up as if they would sweep us\naway into the depths below.\n\nAnother of our delightful excursions was made under the guidance of my\nold and dear friend Robert Chambers.*\n [footnote...\nI cannot pass over the mention of Robert Chambers's name without adding\nthat I was on terms of the most friendly intimacy with him from a very\nearly period of his life to its termination in 1871.\nI remember when he made his first venture in business in Leith Walk.\nBy virtue of his industry, ability, and energy, he became a prosperous\nman.  I had the happiness of enjoying his delightful and instructive\nsociety on many occasions. We had rare cracks on all subjects, but\nespecially respecting old places and old characters whom we had known\nat Edinburgh.  His natural aptitude to catch up the salient and most\nhumorous points of character, with the quaint manner in which he could\ndescribe them, gave a vast charm to his company and conversation.\nAdded to which, the wide range and accuracy of his information,\nacquired by his own industry and quick-witted penetration, caused the\nhours spent in his society to remain among the brightest points in my\nmemory.\n ...]\n\nThe object of this excursion was to visit the remarkable series of\ngrooved and scratched rocks which had been discovered*\n [footnote...\nThey had been first seen, some twenty years before, by Sir James Hall,\none of the geologic lights of Edinburgh.\n ...]\non the western edge of the cliff-like boundary of Corstorphine Hill.\nThe glacial origin of these groovings on the rocks was then occupying\nthe attention of geologists.  It was a subject that Robert Chambers had\ncarefully studied, in the Lowlands, in the Highlands, in Rhine-land,\nin Switzerland, and in Norway.  He had also published his Ancient Sea\nMargins and his Tracings of the North of Europe in illustration of his\nviews.   He was now enabled to show us these groovings and scratchings\non the rocks near Edinburgh.  In order to render the records more\naccessible, he had the heather and mossy turf carefully removed--\nespecially from some of the most distinct evidences of glacial\nrock-grooving.  Thus no time was lost, and we immediately saw the\nunquestionable markings.  Such visits as these are a thousand times\nmore instructive and interesting than long papers read at scientific\nmeetings.  They afford the best opportunity for interchange of ideas,\nand directly produce an emphatic result; for one cannot cavil about\nwhat he has seen with his eyes and felt with his hands.\n\nWe returned to the city in time to be present at a most interesting\nlecture by Hugh Miller on the Boulder Clay.\nHe illustrated it by some scratched boulders which he had collected\nin the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.  He brought the subject before his\naudience in his own clear and admirable viva voce style.\nThe Duke of Argyll was in the chair, and a very animated discussion\ntook place on this novel and difficult subject.\nIt was humorously brought to a conclusion by the Rev. Dr. Fleming,\na shrewd and learned geologist.  Like many others, he had encountered\ngreat difficulties in arriving at definite conclusions on this\nmysterious subject.  He concluded his remarks upon it by describing the\ninfluence it had in preventing his sleeping at night.\nHe was so restless on one occasion that his wife became seriously alarmed.\n\"What's the matter wi' ye, John? are ye ill?\" \"On no,\" replied the doctor,\n\"it's only that confounded Bounder Clay!\"  This domestic anecdote\nbrought down the house, and the meeting terminated in a loud and hearty\nlaugh.\n\nI, too, contributed my little quota of information to the members of\nthe British Association.  I had brought with me from Lancashire a\nconsiderable number of my large graphic illustrations of the details of\nthe Moon's surface.  I gave a viva voce account of my lunar researches\nat a crowded meeting of the Physical Section A.  The novel and\ninteresting subject appeared to give so much satisfaction to the\naudience that the Council of the Association requested me to repeat the\naccount at one of the special evenings, when the members of all the\nvarious sections were generally present.  It was quite a new thing for\nme to appear as a public lecturer; but I consented.  The large hall of\nthe Assembly Rooms in George Street was crowded with an attentive\naudience.  The Duke of Argyll was in the chair.  It is a difficult\nthing to give a public lecture especially to a scientific audience.\nTo see a large number of faces turned up, waiting for the words of the\nlecturer, is a somewhat appalling sight.  But the novelty of the\nsubject and the graphic illustrations helped me very much.  I was quite\nfull of the Moon.  The words came almost unsought; and I believe the\nlecture went off very well, and terminated with \"great applause.\"\nAnd thus the meeting of the British Association at Edinburgh came to an\nend.\n\nThis, however, was not the end of our visit to Scotland.\nI was strongly urged by the Duke of Argyll to pay him a visit at his\ncastle at Inverary.  I had frequently before had the happiness of\nmeeting the Duke and Duchess at the Earl of Ellesmere's mansion at\nWorsley Hall He had made us promise that if we ever came to Scotland we\nwere not to fail to pay him a visit.  It was accordingly arranged at\nEdinburgh that we should carry out our promise, and spend some days\nwith him at Inverary before our return home.  We were most cordially\nwelcomed at the castle, and enjoyed our visit exceedingly.  We had the\npleasure of seeing the splendid scenery of the Western Highlands the\nmountains round the head of Loch Fyne, Loch Awe, and the magnificent\nhoary-headed Ben Cruachan, requiring a base of more than twenty miles\nto support him,--besides the beautiful and majestic scenery of the\nneighbourhood.\n\nBut my chief interest was in the specimens of high geological interest\nwhich the Duke showed me.  He had discovered them in the Island of Mull,\nin a bed of clay shale, under a volcanic basaltic cliff over eighty feet\nhigh, facing the Atlantic Ocean.  He found in this bed many beautifully\nperfect impressions of forest tree leaves, chiefly of the plane-tree\nclass.  They appeared to have been enveloped in the muddy bottom of a\nlake, which had been sealed up by the belching forth from the bowels of\nthe earth of molten volcanic basaltic lava, and which indeed formed the\nchief material of the Island of Mull.  This basaltic cliff now fronts\nthe Atlantic, and resists its waves like a rock of iron.  To see all\nthe delicate veins and stalklets, and exact forms of what had once been\nthe green fresh foliage of a remotely primeval forest, thus brought to\nlight again, as preserved in their clay envelope, after they had lain\nfor ages and ages under what must have been the molten outburst of some\ntremendous volcanic discharge, and which now formed the rock-bound\ncoast of Mull, filled one's mind with an idea of the inconceivable\nlength of time that must have passed since the production of these\nWonderful geological phenomena.\n\nI felt all the more special interest in these specimens, as I had many\nyears before, on my return visit from Londonderry, availed myself of\nthe nearness of the Giant's Causeway to make a careful examination of\nthe marvellous volcanic columns in that neighbourhood. Having scrambled\nup to a great height, I found a thick band of hematitic clay underneath\nthe upper bed of basalt, which was about sixty feet thick.  In this\nclay I detected a rich deposit of completely charred branches of what\nhad once been a forest tree.  The bed had been burst through by the\noutburst of molten basalt, and converted the branches into charcoal.\nI dug out some of the specimens, and afterwards distributed them\namongst my geological friends.  The Duke was interested by my account,\nwhich so clearly confirmed his own discovery.  On a subsequent occasion\nI revisited the Giant's Causeway in company with my dear wife.\nI again scrambled up to the hematitic bed of clay under the basaltic cliff,\nand dug out a sufficient quantity of the charred branches, which I sent\nto the Duke, in confirmation of his theory as to the origin of the\nleaf-beds at Mull.*\n [footnote...\n\nI received the following reply from the Duke of Argyll dated \"Inverary,\nNov. 19, 1850\": --\n\n\"MY DEAR SIR--Am I right in concluding, from the description which;\nyou were so kind as to send to me, that the lignite bed, with its\nsuperincumbent basalts, lies above those particular columnar basalts\nwhich form the far-famed Giant's Causeway?  I see from your sketch that\nbasalts of great thickness, and in some views beautifully columnar,\ndo underlie the lignite bed; but I am not quite sure that these\ncolumnar basalts are those precisely which are called the Causeway.\nI had never heard before that the Giant's Causeway rested on chalk,\nwhich all the basalts in your sketch do.\n\n[Image] The Astrologers Tower--A Day Dream.  By James Nasmyth.\n        (Facsimile.)\n\n\"I have been showing your drawing of 'Udolpho Castle' and\n'The Astrologer's Tower' to the Duchess of Sutherland, who is enchanted\nwith the beauty of the architectural details, and wishes she had seen\nthem before Dunrobin was finished; for hints might  have been taken\nfrom bits of your work. --Very truly yours,\n\nARGYLL.\"\n ...]\n\nIn the year following the meeting of the British Association at\nEdinburgh, the great Exhibition of all nations at London took place.\nThe Commissioners appointed for carrying out this noble enterprise had\nmade special visits to Manchester and the surrounding manufacturing\ndistricts for the purpose of organising local committees, so that the\nmachinery and productions of each might be adequately represented in\nthe World's Great Industrial Exhibition.  The Commissioners were met\nwith enthusiasm; and nearly every manufacturer was found ready to\ndisplay the results of his industry.  The local engineers and tool-makers\nwere put upon their mettle, and each endeavoured to do his best.  Like\nothers, our firm contributed specimens of our special machine tools,\nand a fair average specimen of the steam hammer, with a 30 cwt.\nhammer-block.\n\nI also sent one of my very simple and compact steam-engines, in the\ndesign of which I had embodied the form of my steam hammer--placing the\ncrank where the anvil of the hammer usually stands.  The simplicity and\ngrace of this arrangement of the steam-engine were much admired.\nIts merits were acknowledged in a way most gratifying to me,\nby its rapid adoption by engineers of every class, especially by marine\nengineers.  It has been adopted for driving the shafts of\nscrew-propelled steamships of the largest kind.  The comparatively\nsmall space it occupies, its compactness, its get-at-ability of parts,\nand the action of gravity on the piston, which, working vertically,\nand having no undue action in causing wearing of the cylinder on one\nside (which was the case with horizontal engines), has now brought my\nSteam Hammer Engine into almost universal use*\n [footnote...\nSir John Anderson, in his Report on the machine tools, textile, and\nother machinery exhibited at Vienna in 1873, makes the following\nobservations: --\"Perhaps the finest pair of marine engines yet produced\nby France, or any other country, were those exhibited by Schneider and\nCompany, the leading firm in France.  These engines were not large,\nbut were perfect in many respects; yet comparatively few of those who\nwere struck with admiration seemed to know that the original of this\nstyle of construction came from the same mind as the Steam Hammer.\nNasmyth's Infant Hercules was the forerunner of all the steam hammer\nengines that have yet been made from that type, which is now being so\nextensively employed for working the screw propeller of steam vessels.\"\n ...]\n\nThe Commissioners, acting on the special recommendation of the jury,\nawarded me a medal for the construction of this form of steam-engine*\n [footnote...\nThe Council of the Exhibition thus describe the engine in the awards: --\n\"Nasmyth, J., Patricroft, Manchester, a small portable direct-acting\nsteam-engine.  The cylinder is fixed, vertical and inverted, the crank\nbeing placed beneath it, and the piston working downwards.\nThe sides of the frame which support the cylinder serve as guides,\nand the bearings of the crank-shaft and fly-wheel are firmly fixed in\nthe bed-plate of the engine.  The arrangement is compact and economical,\nand the workmanship practically good and durable.\"\n(See illustration of the design, page 424.)\n ...]\nas it was merely a judicious arrangement of the parts, and not, in any\ncorrect sense of the term, an invention, I took out no patent for it,\nand left it free to work its own way into general adoption.\nIt has since been used for high as well as low-pressure steam--\nan arrangement which has come into much favour on account of the great\neconomy of fuel which results from using it.\n\nA Council Medal was also awarded to me for the Steam Hammer.\nBut perhaps what pleased me most was the Prize Medal which I received\nfor my special hobby--the drawings of the Moon's surface.  I sent a\ncollection of these, with a map, to the Exhibition.  They attracted\nconsiderable attention, not only because of their novelty, but because\nof the accurate and artistic style of their execution.  The Jurors, in\nmaking the award, gave the following description of them:  \"Mr. Nasmyth\nexhibits a well-delineated map of the Moon on a large scale, which is\ndrawn with great accuracy, the irregularities upon the surface being\nshown with much force and spirit; also separate and enlarged\nrepresentations of certain portions of the Moon as seen through a\npowerful telescope:  they are all good in detail, and very effective.\"\n\nMy drawings of the Moon attracted the special notice of the Prince\nConsort.  Shortly after the closing of the Exhibition, in October 1851,\nthe Queen and the Prince made a visit to Manchester and Liverpool,\nduring which time they were the guests of the Earl of Ellesmere at\nWorsley Hall.  Finding that I lived near at hand, the Prince expressed\nhis desire to the Earl that I should exhibit to Her Majesty some of my\ngraphic lunar studies.\n\nOn receiving a note to that effect from the Countess of Ellesmere,\nI sent a selection of my drawings to the Hall, and proceeded there in\nthe evening.  I had then the honour of showing them to the Queen and\nthe Prince, and explaining them in detail.  Her Majesty took a deep\ninterest in the subject, and was most earnest in her inquiries.\nThe Prince Consort' said that the drawings opened up quite a new\nsubject to him, which he had not before had the opportunity of\nconsidering.  It was as much as I could do to answer the numerous keen\nand incisive questions which he put to me.  They were all so distinct\nand cogent.  Their object was, of course, to draw from me the necessary\nexplanations on this rather recondite subject.  I believe, however,\nthat notwithstanding the presence of Royalty, I was enabled to place\nall the most striking and important features of the Moon's surface in a\nclear and satisfactory manner before Her Majesty and the Prince,\n\nI find that the Queen in her Diary alludes in the most gratifying\nmanner to the evening's interview.  In the Life of the Prince Consort\n(vol. ii. p. 398), Sir Theodore Martin thus mentions the subject: --\n\"The evening was enlivened by the presence of Mr. Nasmyth, the inventor\nof the steam hammer, who had extensive works at Patricroft.\nHe exhibited and explained the map and drawings in which he had\nembodied the results of his investigations of the conformations of the\nsurface of the Moon.  The Queen in her Diary dwells at considerable\nlength on the results of Mr. Nasmyth's inquiries.  The charm of his\nmanner, in which the simplicity, modesty, and enthusiasm of genius are\nall strikingly combined, are warmly dwelt upon.  Mr. Nasmyth belongs to\na family of painters, and would have won fame for himself as an artist\n--for his landscapes are as true to Nature as his compositions are\nfull of fancy and feeling--had not science and mechanical invention\nclaimed him for their own.  His drawings were submitted on this\noccasion.  and their beauty was generally admired.*\n [footnote...\nIn his lecture on the \"Geological Features of Edinburgh and its\nNeighbourhood,\" in the following year, Hugh Miller, speaking of the\nCastle Rock, observed: --\"The underlying strata, though geologically\nand in their original position several hundred feet higher than those\nwhich underlie the Castle esplanade, are now, with respect to the\nactual level, nearly 200 feet lower.  In a lecture on what may be\ntermed the geology of the Moon, delivered in the October of last year\nbefore Her Majesty and Prince Albert by Mr. Nasmyth, he referred to\ncertain appearances on the surface of that satellite that seemed to be\nthe results, in some very ancient time, of the sudden falling in of\nportions of an unsupported crust, or a retreating nucleus of molten\nmatter; and took occasion to suggest that some of the great slips and\nshifts on the surface of our own planet, with their huge downcasts, may\nhave had a similar origin.  The suggestion is at once bold and ingenious.\"\n ...]\n\nThe next time I visited Edinburgh was in the autumn of 1853.\nLord Cockburn, an old friend, having heard that I was sojourning in the\ncity, sent me the following letter, dated \"Bonally, 3rd September,\"\ninviting me to call a meeting of the Faithful:\n\n\"MY DEAR Sir--Instead of being sketching, as I thought, in Switzerland,\nI was told yesterday that you were in Auld Reekie.  Then why not come\nout here next Thursday, or Friday, or Saturday, and let us have a\nHill Day?  I suppose I need not write to summon the Faithful, because\nnot having been in Edinburgh except once for above a month, I don't\nknow where the Faithful are.  But you must know their haunts, and it\ncan't give you much trouble to speak to them.  I should like to see\nLauder here.  And don't forget the Gaberlunzie.--Ever,\n\nH.  COCKBURN\"*\n [footnote...\nJames Ballantine, author of The Gaberlunzie's Wallet.  In August 1865\nMr. Ballantine wrote to me saying:  \"If ever you are in Auld Reekie I\nshould feel proud of a call from you.  I have not forgotten the\ndelightful day we spent together many years ago at Bonny Bonally with\nthe eagle-eyed Henry Cockburn!\"\n ...]\n\nThe meeting came off.  I collected a number of special friends about\nme, and I took my wife to the meeting of the Faithful.  There were\npresent David Roberts, Clarkson Stanfield, Louis and Carl Haag,\nSir George Harvey, James Ballantine, and D. O. Hill--all artists.\nWe made our way to Bonny Bonally, a charming residence, situated at the\nfoot of the Pentland Hills.*\n [footnote...\nThe house was afterwards occupied by the lamented Professor Hodgson,\nthe well-known Political Economist.\n ...]\nThe day was perfect--in all respects \"equal to bespoke.\"  With that most\ngenial of men, Lord Cockburn, for our guide, we wandered far up the\nPentland Hills.  After a rather toilsome walk we reached a favourite\nspot.  It was a semicircular hollow in the hillside, scooped out by the\nsheep for shelter.  It was carpeted and cushioned with a deep bed of\nwild thyme, redolent of the very essence of rural fragrance.\n\nWe sat down in a semicircle, our guide in the middle.  He said in his\nquaint peculiar way, \"Here endeth the first lesson.\"  After gathering\nour breath, and settling ourselves to enjoy our well-earned rest,\nwe sat in silence for a time.  The gentle breeze blew past us, and we\ninhaled the fragrant air.  It was enough for a time to look on, for the\nglorious old city was before us, with its towers, and spires, and lofty\nbuildings between us and the distance.  On one side Arthur's Seat, and\non the other the Castle, the crown of the city.  The view extended far\nand wide--on to the waters of the Forth and the blue hills of Fife.\nThe view is splendidly described by \"Delta\": --\n\n \"Traced like a map, the landscape lies\n In cultured beauty, stretching wide:\n Here Pentland's green acclivities,--\n There ocean, with its swelling tide,--\n There Arthur's Seat and gleaming through\n Thy Southern wing, Dull Edin blue!\n While, in the Orient, Lammer's daughters,--\n A distant giant range, are seen;\n North Berwick Law, with cone of green,\n And Bass amid the waters.\"\n\nThen we began to crack, our host leading the way with his humorous\nobservations.  After taking our fill of rest and talk, we wended our\nway down again, with the \"wimplin' burn\" by our side, fresh from the\npure springs of the hill, whispering its welcome to us.\n\nWe had earned a good appetite for dinner, which was shortly laid before us.\nThe bill of fare was national, and included a haggis:\n\n \"Fair fa' your honest sonsie face,\n Great chieftain o' the puddin' race!\n Weel are ye wordy o'a grace\n As lang's my arm!\"\n\nThe haggis was admirably compounded and cooked, and was served forth by\nour genial host with all appropriate accompaniments.  But the most\nenjoyable was the conversation of Lord Cockburn, who was a master of\nthe art--quick ready, humorous, and full of wit.  At last, the day\ncame to a close, and we wended our way towards the city.\n\nLet me, however, before concluding, say a few words in reference to my\ndear departed friend David Oswald Hill.  His name calls up many\nrecollections of happy hours spent in his company.  He was, in all\nrespects, the incarnation of geniality.  His lively sense of humour,\ncombined with a romantic and poetic constitution of mind, and his fine\nsense of the beautiful in Nature and art, together with his kindly and\ngenial feeling, made him, all in all, a most agreeable friend and\ncompanion.  \"D. O. Hill,\" as he was generally called, was much attached\nto my father.  He was a very frequent visitor at our Edinburgh\nfireside, and was ever ready to join in our extemporised walks and\njaunts, when he would overflow with his kindly sympathy and humour.\nHe was a skilful draughtsman, and possessed a truly poetic feeling for\nart.  His designs for pictures were always attractive, from the fine\nfeeling exhibited in their composition and arrangement. But somehow,\nwhen he came to handle the brush, the result was not always\nsatisfactory--a defect not uncommon with artists.  Altogether,\nhe was a delightful companion and a staunch friend, and his death made\na sad blank in the artistic society of Edinburgh.\n\n\nCHAPTER 19.  More about Astronomy.\n\nAstronomy, instead of merely being an amusement, became my chief study.\nIt occupied many of my leisure hours.  Desirous of having the advantage\nof a Reflecting Telescope of large aperture, I constructed one of\ntwenty-inches diameter.  In order to avoid the personal risk and\ninconvenience of having to mount to the eye-piece by a ladder,\nI furnished the telescope tube with trunnions, like a cannon, with one\nof the trunnions hollow so as to admit of the eye-piece.  Opposite to\nit a plain diagonal mirror was placed, to transmit the image to the\neye.  The whole was mounted on a turn-table, having a seat opposite to\nthe eye-piece, as will be seen in the engraving on the other side.\n\n[Image]  \"Trunnion Vision\" Reflecting telescope of 20-inch diameter\n         mounted on a turn-table.\n\nThe observer, when seated, could direct the telescope to any part of\nthe heavens without moving from his seat.  Although this arrangement\noccasioned some loss of light, that objection was more than compensated\nby the great convenience which it afforded for the prosecution of the\nspecial class of observations in which I was engaged namely, that of\nthe Sun, Moon, and Planets.\n\nI wrote to my old friend Sir David Brewster, then living at St. Andrews,\nin 1849, about this improvement and he duly congratulated me upon my\ndevotion to astronomical science.  In his letter to me he brought to\nmind many precious memories.\n\n\"I recollect,\" he said, \"with much pleasure the many happy hours that I\nspent in your father's house; and ever since I first saw you in your\nlittle workshop at Edinburgh,--then laying the foundation of your\nfuture fortunes,--I have felt a deep interest in your success, and\nrejoiced at your progress to wealth and reputation.\n\n\"I have perused with much pleasure the account you have sent me of your\nplan of shortening and moving large telescopes, and I shall state to\nyou the opinion which I have formed of it.  If you will look into the\narticle 'Optics' in the Edinburgh Encyclopedia (vol. xv. p. 643),\nyou will find an account of what has been previously done to reduce by\none-half the length of reflecting telescopes.  The advantage of\nsubstituting, as you propose, a convex for a plane mirror arises from\ntwo causes that a spherical surface is more easily executed than a\nplane one; and that the spherical aberration of the larger speculum,\nif it be spherical, will be diminished by the opposite aberration of\nthe convex one.  This advantage, however, will disappear if the plane\nmirror of the old construction is accurately plane; and in your case,\nif the large speculum is parabolic and the small one elliptical in\ntheir curvature.\n\n\"The only objection to your construction is the loss of light;\nfirst of one-fourth of the whole incident light by obstruction, and\nthen one-half of the remainder by reflection from the convex mirror,\nthus reducing 100 rays of incident light to 37 1/2 before the pencil is\nthrown out of the tube by a prism or a third reflector.  This loss of\nlight, it is true, may be compensated by an additional inch or two to\nthe margin of the large speculum; but still it is the best part of the\nlarge speculum that is made unproductive by the eclipse of it by the\nconvex speculum.  \"With regard to the mechanical contrivance which you\npropose for working the instrument, I think it is singularly ingenious\nand beautiful, and will compensate for any imperfection in the optical\narrangements which are rendered necessary for its adoption.\nThe application of the railway turn-table is very happy, and not less\nso is the extraction of the image through the hollow trunnions.\n\n\"I am much obliged to you for the beautiful drawing of the apparatus\nfor grinding and polishing specula, invented by Mr. Lassell and\nconstructed by yourself.  I shall be glad to hear of your further\nprogress in the construction of your telescope; and I trust that I\nshall have the pleasure of meeting you and Mr. Lassell at the\nBirmingham meeting of the British Association.\n\nIn the course of the same year (1849) I sent a model of my Trunnion\nturn-table telescope for exhibition at a lecture at the Royal\nInstitution, given by my old friend Edward Cowper.  In the model I had\nplaced a neat little figure of the observer, but the head had\nunfortunately been broken off during its carriage to London.\nMrs. Nasmyth had made the wearing apparel; but Edward Cowper wrote to\nher, before the lecture, that he had put \"Sir Fireside Brick\" all to\nrights in respect of his garb.  His letter after the lecture was quite\ncharacteristic.\n\n\"The lecture,\" he said, \"went off very well last night.\nAll the models performed their duty, and were duly applauded for doing so.\nMy new equatorial was approved of by astronomers and by instrument-makers.\nThe last gun I fired was a howitzer, but mounted swivel-gun fashion;\non a sort of revolving platform, or something like a turn-table proper\n--the gunner at the side of the carriage.  Do you know anything of the\nkind?  Bang!  Invented by one Nasmyth.  Bang!  The observer is sitting at\nease; the stars are brought down to you instead of your creeping up a\nscaffolding after the stars.  Well, the folks came to the table after\nthe lecture, and 'The Nasmyth Telescope' kept banging away for a\nquarter of an hour, and was admired by everybody.  The loss of light\nwas not much insisted on, but it was said that you ran the risk of\nerror of form in three surfaces instead of two.  I see that Sir J. South\nstates that Lord Rosse would increase the light of his telescope from\nfive to seven by adopting Herschel's plan.\n\n\"De La Rue was quite delighted.  He said, 'Well, I congratulate you on\na most splendid lecture--I cannot call it anything else.' My father,\nwho takes very little interest in these things, said, 'Well, Edward has\nmade me understand more about telescopes than I ever did in my life.'\nThe theatre was full, gallery and all.  They were very attentive,\nand I never felt more comfortable in a lecture.  I am happy to say that,\nhaving administered a dose of cement to Mrs. Nasmyth's friend,\nSir Fireside Brick of Green Lanes, he is now in a convalescent state.\nThe lecture is to be repeated in another fortnight.  With many thanks\nfor your kind assistance, yours very sincerely,\n\n\"EDWARD COWPER.\"\n\nIn the course of my astronomical inquiries I had occasion to consider\nthe causes of the sun's light.  I observed the remarkable phenomena of\nthe variable and some times transitory brightness of the stars.  In\nconnection with geology, there was the evidence of an arctic or glacial\nclimate in regions where such cannot now naturally exist; thus giving\nevidence of the existence of a condition of climate, for the\nexplanation of which we look in vain for any at present known cause.\nI wrote a paper on the subject, which I sent to the Astronomical\nSociety.  It was read in May 1851.  In that paper I wrote as follows:\n\n\"A course of observations on the solar spots, and on the remarkable\nfeatures which from time to time appear on the sun's surface, which I\nhave examined with considerable assiduity for several years, had in the\nfirst place led me to entertain the following conclusion:  namely, that\nwhatever be the nature of solar light, its main source appears to\nresult from an action induced on the exterior surface of solar\nsphere,-- a conclusion in which I doubt not all who have attentively\npursued observations on the structure of the sun's surface will agree.\n\n\"Impressed with the correctness of this conclusion, I was led to\nconsider whether we might not reasonably consider the true source of\nthe latent element of light to reside, not in the solar orb, but in\nspace itself; and that the grand function and duty of the sun was to\nact as an agent for bringing forth into vivid existence its due portion\nof the illuminating or luciferous element, which element I suppose to\nbe diffused throughout the boundless regions of space, and which in\nthat case must be exhaustless.\n\nAssuming, therefore, that the sun's light is the result of some\npeculiar action by which it brings forth into visible existence the\nelement of light, which I conceive to be latent in, and diffused\nthroughout space, we have but to imagine the existence of a very\nprobable condition, namely, the unequal diffusion of this\nlight-yielding element, to catch a glimpse of a reason why our sun may,\nin common with his solar brotherhood, in some portions of his vast\nstellar orbit, have passed, and may yet have to pass, through regions\nof space, in which the light-yielding element may either abound or be\ndeficient, and so cause him to beam forth with increased splendour,\nor fade in brilliancy, just in proportion to the richness or poverty of\nthis supposed light-yielding element as may occur in those regions of\nspace through which our sun, in common with every stellar orb,\nhas passed, is now passing, or is destined to pass, in following up\ntheir mighty orbits.\n\n\"Once admit that this light-yielding element resides in space, and that\nit is not equally diffused, we may then catch a glimpse of the cause of\nthe variable and transitory brightness of stars,and more especially of\nthose which have been known to beam forth with such extraordinary\nsplendour, and have again so mysteriously faded away; many instances of\nwhich abound in historical record.\n\n\"Finally, in reference to such a state of change having come over our\nsun, as indicated by the existence of a glacial period, as is now\nplaced beyond doubt by geological research, it appears to me no very\nwild stretch of analogy to suppose that in such former periods of the\nearth's history our sun may have passed through portions of his stellar\norbit in which the light-yielding element was deficient, and in which\ncase his brilliancy would have suffered the while, and an arctic\nclimate in consequence spread from the poles towards the equator,\nand thus leave the record of such a condition in glacial handwriting on\nthe everlasting walls of our mountain ravines, of which there is such\nabundant and unquestionable evidence.  As before said, it is the\nexistence of such facts as we have in stars of transitory brightness,\nand the above named evidence of an arctic climate existing in what are\nnow genial climates, that renders some adequate cause to be looked for.\nI have accordingly hazarded the preceding remarks as suggestive of a\ncause, in the hope that the subject may receive that attention which\nits deep interest entitles it to obtain.\n\n\"This view of the source of light, as respects the existence of the\nluciferous element throughout space, accords with the Mosaic account of\ncreation, in so far as that light is described as having been created\nin the first instance before the sun was called forth.\"\nDr Siemens read a paper before the Royal Society in March 1882,\non \"A New Theory of the Sun\".  His views in many respects coincided\nwith mine.*\n [footnote...\nInterstellar space, according to Dr. Siemens, is filled with\nattenuated matter, consisting of highly rarefied gaseous bodies--\nincluding hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, and aqueous vapour;\nthat these gaseous compounds are capable of being dissociated by\nradiant solar energy while in a state of extreme attenuation; and that\nthe vapours so dissociated are drawn towards the sun in consequence of\nsolar rotation, are flashed into flame in the photosphere, and rendered\nback into space in the condition of products of combustion.\nWith respect to the influence of the sun's light on geology, Dr. Siemens\nsays: \"The effect of this continuous outpour of solar materials could\nnot be without very important influences as regards the geological\nconditions of our earth.  Geologists have long acknowledged the\ndifficulty of accounting for the amount of carbonic acid that must have\nbeen in our atmosphere at one time or another in order to form with\nlime those enormous beds of dolomite and limestone of which the crust\nof our earth is in great measure composed.  It has been calculated that\nif this carbonic acid had been at one and the same time in our\natmosphere it would have caused an elastic pressure fifty times that of\nour present atmosphere; and if we add the carbonic acid that must have\nbeen absorbed in vegetation in order to form our coal-beds we should\nprobably have to double that pressure.  Animal life, of which we had\nabundant traces in these 'measures,' could not have existed under such\nconditions, we are almost forced to the conclusion that the carbonic\nacid must have been derived from an external source.\"\n ...]\n\nSoon after my paper was read, Lord Murray of Henderland, an old friend,\nthen a Judge on the Scottish Bench, wrote to me as follows: --\"I shall\nbe much obliged to you for a copy, if you have a spare one, of your\nprinted note on Light.  It is expressed with great clearness and\nbrevity.  If you wish to have a quotation for it, you may have recourse\nto the blind Milton, who has expressed your views in his address to\nLight: --\n\n \"'Hail, holy Light! offspring of heaven first-born\n Or of the Eternal co-eternal beam\n May I express thee unblamed? since God is light,\n And never but in unapproached light\n Dwelt from eternity--dwelt then in thee,\n Bright effluence of bright essence increate!\"'\n\nAbout the same time Sir Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor General of Australia,\ncommunicated his notions on the subject.  \"My dear Sir,\" he wrote,\n\"Your kind and valuable communications are as welcome to me as the\nsun's light, and I now thank you most gratefully for the last, with its\ntwo enclosures.  These, and especially your views as to the source of\nlight, afford me new scope for satisfactory thinking--a sort of\ntreasure one can always carry about, and, unlike other treasures,\nis most valuable in the solitude of a desert.  The beauty of your\ntheory as to the nature of the source of light is, that it rather\nsupports all preconceived notions respecting the soul, heaven, and an\nimmortal state.\"\n\nI still continued the study of astronomy.  The sun, moon, and planets\nyielded to me an inexhaustible source of delight.  I gazed at them with\nincreasing wonder and awe.  Among the glorious objects which the\ntelescope reveals, the most impressive is that of the starry heavens in\na clear dark night.  When I directed my 20-inch reflecting telescope\nalmost at random to any part of the firmament, especially to any\nportion of the Milky Way, the sight of myriads of stars brought into\nview within the field of the eye-piece was overpoweringly sublime.\n\nWhen it is considered that every one of these stars which so\nbewilderingly crowd the field of vision is, according to rational\nprobability, and, I might even say, absolute certainty, are Suns as\nvast in magnitude as that which gives light to our globe, and yet\nsituated so inconceivably deep in the abyss of space as to appear\nminute points of light even to the most powerful telescope, it will be\nfelt what a sublime subject appears before us.  Turn the telescope to\nany part of the heavens, it is the same.\n\nLet us suppose ourselves perched upon the farthest star which we are\nenabled to see by the aid of the most powerful telescope.  There, too,\nwe should see countless myriads of Suns, rolling along in their\nappointed orbits, and thus on and on throughout eternity.  What an idea\nof the limitless extent of Creative Power--filling up infinite space\nwith the evidences of His Almighty Presence!  The human mind feels its\nutter impotency in endeavouring to grasp such a subject.\n\nI also turned my attention to the microscope.  In 1851 I examined, by\nthe aid of this instrument, the infusoria in the Bridgewater Canal.\nI found twenty-seven of them, of the most varied form, colour,\nand movements.  This was almost as remarkable a revelation as the\nmighty phenomena of the heavens.  I found these living things moving\nabout in the minutest drop of water.  The sight of the wonderful range\nof creative power--from the myriads of suns revealed by the\ntelescope, to the myriads of moving organisms revealed by the\nmicroscope--filled me with unutterably devout wonder and awe.\n\nMoreover, it seemed to me to confer a glory even upon the instruments\nof human skill, which elevated man to the Unseen and the Divine.\nWhen we examine the most minute organisms, we find clear evidence in\ntheir voluntary powers of motion that these creatures possess a will,\nand that such Will must be conveyed by a nervous system of an\ninfinitesimally minute description.  When we follow out such a train of\nthought, and contrast the myriads of suns and planets at one extreme,\nwith the myriads of minute organised atoms at the other, we cannot but\nfeel inexpressible wonder at the transcendent range of Creative Power.\n\nShortly after, I sent to the Royal Astronomical Society a paper on\nanother equally wonderful subject, \"The Rotatory Movements of the\nCelestial Bodies.  As the paper is not very long, and as I endeavoured\nto illustrate my ideas in a familiar manner, I may here give it entire:\n\n\"What first set me thinking on this subject was the endeavour to get at\nthe reason of why water in a basin acquires a rotatory motion when a\nportion of it is allowed to escape through a hole in the bottom.\nEvery well-trained philosophical judgment is accustomed to observe\nillustrations of the most sublime phenomena of creation in the most\nminute and familiar operations of the Creator's laws, one of the most\ncharacteristic features of which consists in the absolute and wonderful\nintegrity maintained in their action whatsoever be the range as to\nmagnitude or distance of the objects on which they operate.\n\n\"For instance, the minute particles of dew which whiten the grass-blade\nin early morn are moulded into spheres by the identical law which gives\nto the mighty sun its globular form!\n\n\"Let us pass from the rotation of water in a basin to the consideration\nof the particles of a nebulous mass just summoned into existence by the\nfiat of the Creator--the law of gravitation coexisting.  \"The first\nmoment of the existence of such a nebulous mass would be inaugurated by\nthe election of a centre of gravity, and, instantly after, every\nparticle throughout the entire mass of such nebulae would tend to and\nconverge towards that centre of gravity.\n\n\"Now let us consider what would be the result of this.  It appears to\nme that the inevitable consequence of the convergence of the particles\ntowards the centre of gravity of such a nebulous mass would not only\nresult in the formation of nucleus, but by reason of the physical\nimpossibility that all the converging particles should arrive at the\nfocus of convergence in directions perfectly radial and diametrically\nopposite to each other, however slight the degree of deviation from the\nabsolute diametrically opposite direction in which the converging\nparticles coalesce at the focus of attraction, a twisting action would\nresult, and Rotation ensue, which, once engendered, be its intensity\never so slight, from that instant forward the nucleus would continue to\nrevolve, and all the particles which its attraction would subsequently\ncause to coalesce with it, would do so in directions tangential to its\nsurface, and not diametrically towards its centre.\n\n\"In due course of time the entire of the remaining nebulous mass would\nbecome affected with rotation from the more rapidly moving centre, and\nwould assume what appears to me to be their inherent normal condition,\nnamely, spirality, as the prevailing character of their structure;\nand as that is actually the aspect which may be said to characterise the\nmajority of those marvellous nebulae, as revealed to us by Lord Rosse's\nmagnificent telescope, I am strongly impressed with the conviction that\nsuch reasons as I have assigned have been the cause of their spiral\naspect and arrangement.\n\n\"And by following up the same train of reasoning, it appears to me that\nwe may catch a glimpse of the primeval cause of the rotation of every\nbody throughout the regions of space, whether they be nebulae, stars,\ndouble stars, or planetary systems.\n\n\"The primary cause of rotation which I have endeavoured to describe in\nthe preceding remarks is essentially cosmical, and is the direct and\nimmediate offspring of the action of gravitation on matter in a\ndiffused, nebulous, and, as such, highly mobile condition.\n\n\"It will be obvious that in the case of a nebulous mass, whose matter\nis unequally distributed, that in such a case several sub-centres of\ngravity would be elected, that is to say, each patch of nebulous matter\nwould have its own centre of gravity; but these in their turn\nsubordinate to that of the common centre of gravity of the whole\nsystem, about which all such outlaying parts would revolve.\nEach of the portions above alluded to would either be attracted by the\nsuperior mass, and pass in towards it as a wisp of nebulous matter,\nor else establish perfect individual and distinct rotation within\nitself, and finally revolve about the great common centre of gravity of\nthe whole.\n\n\"Bearing this in mind, and referring to some of the figures of the\nmarvellous spiral nebulae which Lord Rosse's telescope has revealed to\nus, I shall now bring these suggestions to a conclusion.\nI have avoided expanding them to the extent I feel the subject to be\nworthy and capable of; but I trust such as I have offered will be\nsufficient to convey a pretty clear idea of my views on this sublime\nsubject, which I trust may receive the careful consideration its nature\nentitles it to.  Let any one carefully reflect on the reason why water\nassumes a rotatory motion when a portion of it is permitted to escape\nfrom an aperture in the bottom of the circular vessel containing it;\nif they will do so in the right spirit, I am fain to think they will\narrive at the same conclusion as the contemplation of this familiar\nphenomenon has brought me to.\n\n\" BRIDGEWATER FOUNDARY, June 7, 1855.\"\n\nI was present at a meeting of the Geological Society at Manchester in\n1853, in the discussions of which I took part.\n\nI was much impressed by an address of the Rev. Dr. Vaughan\n(then Principal of the Independent College at Manchester), which is as\ninteresting now as it was then.  After referring to the influence which\ngeological changes had produced upon the condition of nations, and the\nmoral results which oceans, mountains, islands, and continents have had\nupon the social history of man, he went on to say:  \"Is not this island\nof ours indebted to these great causes?  Oh, that blessed geological\naccident that broke up a strait between Calais and Dover!  It looks but\na little thing; it was a matter to take place; but how mighty the moral\nresults upon the condition and history of this country, and, through\nthis country's influence, upon humanity!  Bridge over the space between,\nand you have directly the huge continental barrack-yard system all over\nEngland.  And once get into the condition of a great continental\nmilitary power, and you get the arbitrary power; you cramp down the\npeople, and you unfit them from being what they ought to be--FREE And\nall the good influences together at work in this country could not have\nsecured us against this, but for that blessed separation between this\nIsle and the Continent.\"\n\nIn 1853 I was appointed a member of the Small Arms Committee for the\npurpose of re-modelling and, in fact, re-establishing the Small Arms\nFactory at Enfield.  The wonderful success of the needle gun in the war\nbetween Prussia and Denmark in 1848 occasioned some alarm amongst our\nmilitary authorities as to the state of affairs at home.  The Duke of\nWellington to the last proclaimed the sufficiency of \"Brown Bess\" as a\nweapon of offence and defence; but matters could no longer be deferred.\nThe United States Government, though possessing only a very small\nstanding army, had established at Springfield a small arms factory,\nwhere, by the use of machine tools specially designed to execute with\nthe most unerring precision all the details of muskets and rifles,\nthey were enabled to dispense with mere manual dexterity, and to\nproduce arms to any amount.  It was finally determined to improve the\nmusketry and rifle systems of the English army.  The Government\nresolved to introduce the American system, by which Arms might be\nproduced much more perfectly, and at a great diminution of cost.\nIt was under such circumstances that the Small Arms Committee was\nappointed.\n\nColonel Colt had brought to England some striking examples of the\nadmirable machine tools used at Springfield, and he established a\nmanufactory at Pimlico for the production of his well-known revolvers.\nThe committee resolved to make a personal visit to the United States\nFactory at Springfield.  My own business engagements at home prevented\nme accompanying the members who were selected; but as my friend John\nAnderson (now Sir John), acted as their guide, the committee had in him\na most able and effective helper.  He directed their attention to the\nmost important and available details of that admirable establishment.\nThe United States Government acted most liberally in allowing the\ncommittee to obtain every information on the subject; and the heads of\nthe various departments, who were intelligent and zealous, rendered\nthem every attention and civility.\n\nThe members of the mission returned home enthusiastically delighted\nwith the results of their inquiry.The committee immediately proceeded\nwith the entire re-modelling of the Small Arms Factory at Enfield.\nThe workshops were equipped with a complete series of special machine\ntools, chiefly obtained from the Springfield factory.\nThe United States Government also permitted several of their best and\nworkman and superintendents to take service under the English Government.\nSuch was the origin of the Enfield rifle.  The weapon came as near to\nabsolute perfection as possible, It was perfect in action, durable and\nexcellent in every respect even in it's conversion to the breechloader\nit is still one of the best weapons.  It is impossible to give too much\npraise to Sir John Anderson and Colonel Dixon for the untiring and\nintelligent zeal with which they carried out the plans, as well as for\nthe numerous improvements which they introduced.  These have rendered\nthe Enfield Small Arms Factory one of the most perfect and best\nregulated establishments in the kingdom.\n\n\nCHAPTER 20.  Retirement from Business.\n\nI had been for some time contemplating the possibility of retiring\naltogether from business.  I had got enough of the world's goods, and\nwas willing to make way for younger men.  But I found it difficult to\nbreak loose from old associations.  Like the retired tallow-chandler,\nI might wish to go back \"on melting days.\"  I had some correspondence\nwith my old friend David Roberts, Royal Academician, on the subject.\nHe wrote to me on the 2d June 1853, and said:\n\n\"I rejoice to learn, from the healthy tone that breathes throughout\nyour epistle, that you are as happy as every one who knows you wishes\nyou to be, and as prosperous as you deserve.  Knowing, also, as I do,\nyour feeling for art and all that tends to raise and dignify man,\nI most sincerely congratulate you on the prospect of your being able to\nretire, in the full vigour of manhood, to follow out that sublime\npursuit, in comparison with which the painter's art is but a faint\nglimmering.  'The Landscape of other worlds' you alone have sketched\nfor us, and enlightened us on that with which the ancient world but\ngazed upon and worshipped in the symbol of Astarte, Isis, and Diana.\nWe are matter-of-fact now, and have outlived childhood.  What say you\nto a photograph of those wonderful drawings?  It may come to that.\"*\n [footnote...\nIt did indeed \"come to that,\" for I shortly after learned the art of\nphotography, chiefly for this special purpose.\n ...]\n\nBut I had something else yet to do in my special vocation.\nIn 1854 I took out a patent for puddling iron by means of steam.\nMany of my readers may not know that cast-iron is converted into\nmalleable iron by the process called puddling.  The iron, while in a\nmolten state, is violently stirred and agitated by a stiff iron rod,\nhaving its end bent like a hoe or flattened hook, by which every\nportion of the molten metal is exposed to the oxygen of the air,\nand the supercharge of carbon which the cast iron contains is\nthus \"burnt out.\"  When this is effectually done the iron becomes\nmalleable and weldable.\n\nThis state of the iron is indicated by a general loss of fluidity,\naccompanied by a tendency to gather together in globular masses.\nThe puddler, by his dexterous use of the end of the rabbling bar,\nputs the masses together, and, in fact, welds the new-born particles of\nmalleable iron into puddle-balls of about three-quarters of a\nhundredweight each.  These are successively removed from the pool of\nthe puddling furnace, and subjected to the energetic blows of the steam\nhammer, which drives out all the scoriae lurking within the spongy\npuddle-balls, and thus welds them into compact masses of malleable iron.\nWhen reheated to a welding heat, they are rolled out into flat bars or\nround rods, in a variety of sizes, so as to be suitable for the consumer.\n\nThe manual and physical labour of the puddler is tedious, fatiguing,\nand unhealthy.  The process of puddling occupies about an hour's\nviolent labour, and only robust young men can stand the fatigue and\nviolent heat.  I had frequent opportunities of observing the labour and\nunhealthiness of the process, as well as the great loss of time\nrequired to bring it to a conclusion.  It occurred to me that much of\nthis could be avoided by employing some other means for getting rid of\nthe superfluous carbon, and bringing the molten cast-iron into a\nmalleable condition.\n\nThe method that occurred to me was the substitution of a small steam\npipe in the place of the puddler's rabbling bar.  By having the end of\nthis steam pipe bent downwards so as to reach the bottom of the pool,\nand then to discharge a current of steam beneath the surface of the\nmolten cast iron, I thought that I should by this simple means supply a\nmost effective carbon-oxidating agent, at the same time that I produced\na powerful agitating action within the pool.  Thus the steam would be\ndecomposed and supply oxygen to the carbon of the cast-iron, while the\nmechanical action of the rush of steam upwards would cause so violent a\ncommotion throughout the pool of melted iron as to exceed the utmost\nefforts of the labour of the puddler.  All the gases would pass up the\nchimney of the puddling furnace, and the puddler would not be subject\nto their influence.  Such was the method specified in my patent of\nl854*\n [footnote...\nSpecification of James Nasmyth--Employment of steam in the process of\npuddling iron.  May 4, 1854; No. 1001.\n ...]\n\nMy friend, Thomas Lever Rushton, proprietor of the Bolton Ironworks,\nwas so much impressed with the soundness of the principle, as well as\nwith the great simplicity of carrying the invention into practical\neffect, that he urged me to secure the patent, and he soon after gave\nme the opportunity of trying the process at his works.  The results\nwere most encouraging.  There was a great saving of labour and time\ncompared with the old puddling process; and the malleable iron\nproduced was found to be of the highest order as regarded strength,\ntoughness, and purity.  My process was soon after adopted by several\niron manufacturers with equally favourable results.  Such, however,\nwas the energy of the steam, that unless the workmen were most careful\nto regulate its force and the duration of its action, the waste of iron\nby undue oxidation was such as in a great measure to neutralise its\ncommercial gain as regarded the superior value of the malleable iron\nthus produced.\n\nBefore I had time or opportunity to remove this commercial difficulty,\nMr. Bessemer had secured his patent of the l7th of October, 1855.\nBy this patent he employed a blast of air to do the same work as I had\nproposed to accomplish by means of a blast of steam, forced up beneath\nthe surface of the molten cast iron.  He added some other improvements,\nwith that happy fertility of invention which has always characterised\nhim.  The results were so magnificently successful as to totally\neclipse my process, and to cast it comparatively into the shade.\nAt the same time I may say that I was in a measure the pioneer of his\ninvention, that I initiated a new system, and led to one of the most\nimportant improvements in the manufacture of iron and steel that has\never been given to the world.\n\nMr. Bessemer brought the subject of his invention before the meeting of\nthe British Association at Cheltenham in the autumn of 1856.  There he\nread his paper \"On the Manufacture of Iron into Steel without Fuel.\"*\n [footnote...\nOn the morning of the day on which the paper was to be read,\nMr. Bessemer was sitting at breakfast at his hotel, when an ironmaster\n(to whom he was unknown) said, laughing, to a friend within his\nhearing, \"Do you know that there is somebody come down from London to\nread us a paper on making steel from cast iron without fuel?  Did you\never hear of such nonsense?\" The title of the paper was perhaps a\nmisnomer, but the correctness of the principles on which the pig iron\nwas converted into malleable iron, as explained by the inventor,\nwas generally recognised, and there seemed every reason to anticipate\nthat the process would before long come into general use.\n ...]\n\nI was present on the occasion, and listened  to his statement with\nmingled feelings of regret and enthusiasm--of regret, because I had\nbeen so clearly superseded and excelled in my performances; and of\nenthusiasm--because I could not but admire and honour the genius who\nhad given so great an  invention to the mechanical world.\nI immediately took the opportunity of giving my assent to the\nprinciples which he had propounded.  My words were not reported at the\ntime, nor was Mr. Bessemer's paper printed by the Association, perhaps\nbecause it was thought of so little importance but, on applying to\nMr. (now Sir Henry) Bessemer, he was so kind as to give me the following\nas his recollection of the words which I used on the occasion.\n\n\"I shall ever feel grateful,\" says Sir Henry, \"for the noble way in\nwhich you spoke at the meeting at Cheltenham of my invention.\nIf I remember rightly, you held up a piece of my malleable iron, saying\nwords to this effect:  'Here is a true British nugget!  Here is a new\nprocess that promises to put an end to all puddling; and I may mention\nthat at this moment there are puddling furnaces in successful operation\nwhere my patent hollow steam Rabbler is at work, producing iron of\nsuperior quality by the introduction of jets of steam in the puddling\nprocess.  I do not, however, lay any claim to this invention of\nMr. Bessemer; but I may fairly be entitled to say that I have advanced\nalong the road on which he has travelled so many miles, and has\neffected such unexpected results that I do not hesitate to say that I\nmay go home from this meeting and tear up my patent, for my process of\npuddling is assuredly superseded.'\"\n\nAfter giving an account of the true origin of his process, in which he\nhad met with failures as well as successes, but at last recognised the\ndecarburation of pig iron by atmospheric air, Sir Henry proceeds to\nsay:\n\n\"I prepared to try another experiment, in a crucible having no hole the\nthe bottom, but which was provided with an iron pipe put through a hole\nin the cover, and passing down nearly to the bottom of the crucible.\nThe small lumps and grains of iron were packed around fit, so as nearly\nto fill the crucible.  A blast of air was to be forced down the pipe so\nas to rise up among the pieces of granular iron and partially\ndecarburise them.  The pipe could then be withdrawn, and the fire urged\nuntil the metal with its coat of oxyde was fused, and cast steel\nthereby produced.\n\n\"While the blowing apparatus for this experiment was being fitted up,\nI was taken with one of those short but painful illnesses to which I\nwas subject at that time.  I was confined to my bed, and it was then\nthat my mind, dwelling for hours together on the experiment about to be\nmade, suggested that instead of trying to decarburise the granulated\nmetal by forcing the air down the vertical pipe among the pieces of\niron, the air would act much more energetically and more rapidly if I\nfirst melted the iron in the crucible, and forced the air down the pipe\nbelow the surface of the fluid metal, and thus burn out the carbon and\nsilicum which it contained.\n\n\"This appeared so feasible, and in every way so great an improvement,\nthat the experiment on the granular pieces was at once abandoned, and,\nas soon as I was well enough, I proceeded to try the experiment of\nforcing the air under the fluid metal.  The result was marvellous.\nComplete decarburation was effected in half an hour.  The heat produced\nwas immense, but, unfortunately more than half the metal was blown out\nof the pot.  This led to the use of pots with large hollow perforated\ncovers, which effectually prevented the loss of metal.\nThese experiments continued from January to October 1855.  I have by me\non the mantelpiece at this moment, a small piece of rolled bar iron\nwhich was rolled at Woolwich arsenal, and exhibited a year later at\nCheltenham.\n\n\"I then applied for a patent, but before preparing my provisional\nspecification (dated October 17, 1855), I searched for other patents to\nascertain whether anything of the sort had been done before.\nI then found your patent for puddling with the steam rabble, and also\nMartin's patent for the use of steam in gutters while molten iron was\nbeing conveyed from the blast furnace to a finery, there to be refined\nin the ordinary way prior to puddling.\n\n\"I then tried steam in my cast steel process, alone, and also mixed\nwith air.  I found that it cooled the metal very much, and of itself\ncould not be used, as it always produced solidification.\nI was nevertheless advised to claim the use of steam as well as air in\nmy particular process (lest it might be used against me), at the same\ntime disclaiming its employment for any purpose except in the\nproduction of fluid malleable iron or steel.  And I have no doubt it is\nto this fact that I referred when speaking to you on the occasion you\nmention.  I have deemed it best that the exact truth--so far as a\nshort history can give it--should be given at once to you, who are so\ntrue and candid.  Had it not been for you and Martin I should probably\nnever have proposed the use of steam in my process, but the use of air\ncame by degrees, just in the way I have described.\"\n\nIt was thoroughly consistent with Mr. Bessemer's kindly feelings\ntowards me, that, after our meeting at Cheltenham, he made me an offer\nof one-third share of the value of his patent.  This would have been\nanother fortune to me.  But I had already made money enough.\nI was just then taking down my signboard and leaving business.\nI did not need to plunge into any such tempting enterprise,\nand I therefore thankfully declined the offer.\n\nMany long years of pleasant toil and exertion had done their work.\nA full momentum of prosperity had been given to my engineering business\nat Patricroft.  My share in the financial results accumulated with\naccelerated rapidity to an amount far beyond my most sanguine hopes.\nBut finding, from long continued and incessant mental efforts, that my\nnervous system was beginning to become shaken, especially in regard to\nan affection of the eyes, which in some respects damaged my sight,\nI thought the time had arrived for me to retire from commercial life.\n\nSome of my friends advised me to \"slack off,\" and not to retire\nentirely from Bridgewater Foundry.  But to do so was not in my nature.\nI could not be indifferent to any concern in which I was engaged.\nI must give my mind and heart to it as before.  I could not give half\nto leisure, and half to business.  I therefore concluded that a final\ndecision was necessary.  Fortunately I possessed an abundant and\nvarious stock of hobbies.  I held all these in reserve to fall back\nupon.  They would furnish me with an almost inexhaustible source of\nhealthy employment.  They might give me occupation for mind and body as\nlong as I lived.  I bethought me of the lines of Burns:\n\n \"Wi' steady aim some Fortune chase;\n Keen hope does ev'ry sinew brace;\n Thro' fair, thro' foul, they urge the race,\n And seize the prey:\n Then cannie, in some cosy place,\n They close the day.\"\n\nIt was no doubt a great sorrow for me and my dear wife to leave the\nHome in which we had been so happy and prosperous for so many years.\nIt was a cosy little cottage at Patricroft.  We had named it \"Fireside.\"\nIt was small, but suitable for our requirements.\nWe never needed to enlarge it, for we had no children to accommodate.\nIt was within five minutes' walk of the Foundry, and I was scarcely\never out of reach of the Fireside, where we were both so happy.\nIt had been sanctified by our united love for thirteen years.\nIt was surrounded by a nice garden, planted with trees and shrubs.\nThough close to the Bridgewater Canal, and a busy manufacturing\npopulation was not far off, the cottage was perfectly quiet.\nIt was in this garden, when I was arranging the telescope at night,\nthat I had been detected by the passing boatman as \"The Patricroft Ghost\"\n\nWhen we were about to leave Patricroft, the Countess of Ellesmere,\nwho, as well as the Earl, had always been our attached friends,\nwrote to my wife as follows:  \"I can well understand Mr. Nasmyth's\nsatisfaction at the emancipation he looks forward to in December next.\nBut I hope you do not expect us to share it! for what is so much\nnatural pleasure to you is a sad loss and privation to us.\nI really don't know how we shall get on at Worsley without you.\nYou have nevertheless my most sincere and hearty good wishes that the\nchange may be as grateful to you both as anything in this world can be.\"\n\nYet we had to tear ourselves away from this abode of peace and\nhappiness.  I had given notice to my partner*\n [footnote...\nThe \"Partner\" here referred to, was my excellent friend Henry Garnett,\nEsq., of Wyre Side, near Lancaster.  He had been my sleeping partner or\n\"Co.\" for nearly twenty years, and the most perfect harmony always\nexisted between us.\n ...]\nthat it was my intention to retire from business at the end of 1856.\nThe necessary arrangements were accordingly made for carrying on the\nbusiness after my retirement.  All was pleasantly and satisfactorily\nsettled several months before I finally left; and the character and\nprosperity of the Bridgewater Foundry have been continued to the\npresent day.\n\nBut where was I to turn to for a settled home?  Many years before I had\nseen a charming picture by my brother Patrick of \"A Cottage in Kent\"\nIt took such a hold of my memory and imagination that I never ceased to\nentertain the longing and ambition to possess such a cottage as a cosy\nplace of refuge for the rest of my life. Accordingly, about six months\nbefore my final retirement, I accompanied my wife in a visit to the\nsouth.  In the first place we made a careful selection from the\nadvertisements in the Times of \"desirable residences\" in Kent.\nOne in particular appeared very tempting.  We set out to view it.\nIt seemed to embody all the conditions that we had pictured in our\nimagination as necessary to fulfil the idea of our \"Cottage in Kent.\"\nIt had been the property of F. R. Lee, the Royal Academician.\nWith a few alterations and additions it would entirely answer our\npurpose.  So we bought the property.\n\nI may mention that when I retired from business, and took out of it the\nfortune that had accumulated during my twenty-two years of assiduous\nattention and labour, I invested the bulk of it in Three per cent\nConsols.  The rate of interest was not high, but it was nevertheless\nsecure.  High interest, as every one knows, means riskful security.\nI desired to have no anxiety about the source of my income, such as\nmight hinder my enjoying the rest of my days in the active leisure\nwhich I desired.  I had for some time before my retirement been\ninvesting in consols, which my dear wife termed \"the true antibilious\nstock,\" and I have ever since had good reason to be satisfied with that\nsafe and tranquillising investment.  All who value the health-conserving\ninfluence of the absence of financial worry will agree with me that\nthis antibilious stock is about the best.\n\nThe \"Cottage in Kent\" was beautiful, especially in its rural\nsurroundings.  The view from it was charming, and embodied all the\nattractive elements of happy-looking English scenery.  The noble old\nforest trees of Penshurst Park were close alongside, and the grand old\nhistoric mansion of Penshurst Place was within a quarter of a mile's\ndistance from our house.  There were many other beautiful parks and\ncountry residences in our neighbourhood; the railway station, which was\nwithin thirty-five minutes' pleasant walk, enabling us to be within\nreach of London, with its innumerable attractions, in little more than\nan hour and a quarter.  Six acres of garden-ground at first surrounded\nour cottage, but these were afterwards expanded to sixteen; and the\nwhole was made beautiful by the planting of trees and shrubs over the\ngrounds.  In all this my wife and myself took the greatest delight.\n\n[Image]  Hammerfield, Penshurst.\n\nFrom my hereditary regard for hammers--two broken hammer-shafts being\nthe crest of our family for hundreds of years--I named the place\nHammerfield; and so it remains to this day.   The improvements and\nadditions to the house and the grounds were considerable.  A greenhouse\nwas built, 120 feet long by 32 feet wide.  Roomy apartments were added\nto the house.  The trees and shrubs planted about the grounds were\ncarefully selected.  The coniferae class were my special favourites.\nI arranged them so that their natural variety of tints should form the\nmost pleasing contrasts.  In this respect I introduced the beech-tree\nwith the happiest effect.  It is bright green in spring, and in the\nautumn it retains its beautiful ruddy-tinted leaves until the end of\nwinter, when they are again replaced by the new growth.\n\nThe warm tint of the beech contrasts beautifully with the bright green\nof the coniferae, especially of the Lawsoniania and the Douglassi--\nthe latter being one of the finest accessions to our list of conifers.\nIt is graceful in form, and perfectly hardy.  I also interspersed with\nthese several birch-trees, whose slender and graceful habit of growth\nforms so fine a contrast to the dense foliage of the conifers.\nTo thus paint, as it were, with trees, is a high source of pleasure in\ngardening.  Among my various enjoyments this has been about the greatest.\n\nDuring the time that the alterations and enlargements were in progress\nwe rented a house for six months at Sydenham, close to the beautiful\ngrounds of the Crystal Palace.  This was a most happy episode in our\nlives, for, besides the great attractions of the place, both inside and\nout, there were the admirable orchestral daily concerts, at which we\nwere constant attendants.  We had the pleasure of listening to the\nnoble compositions of the great masters of music, the perfectly trained\nband being led by Herr Manns, who throws so much of his fine natural\ntaste and enthusiastic spirit into the productions as to give them\nevery possible charm.\n\nFrom a very early period of my life I have derived the highest\nenjoyment from listening to music, especially to melody, which is to me\nthe most pleasing form of composition.  When I have the opportunity of\nlistening to such kind of music, it yields me enjoyment that transcends\nall others.  It suggests ideas, and brings vividly before the mind's\neye scenes that move the imagination.  This is, to me, the highest\norder of excellence in musical composition.  I used long ago, and still\ncontinue, to whistle a bit, especially when engaged in some pleasant\noccupation.  I can draw from my mental repository a vast number of airs\nand certain bits of compositions that I had once heard.  I possess that\nimportant qualification for a musician--\"a good ear;\" and I always\nworked most successfully at a mechanical drawing when I was engaged in\nwhistling some favourite air.  The dual occupation of the brain had\nalways the best results in the quick development of the constructive\nfaculty.  And even in circumstances where whistling is not allowed I\ncan think airs, and enjoy them almost as much as when they are\ndistinctly audible.  This power of the brain, I am fain to believe,\nindicates the natural existence of the true musical faculty.  But I had\nbeen so busy during the course of my life that I had never any\nopportunity of learning the practical use of any musical instrument.\nAnd here I must leave this interesting subject.\n\nSo soon as I was in due possession of my house, I had speedily\ntransported thither all my art treasures--my telescopes, my home\nstock of tools, the instruments of my own construction, made from the\nvery beginning of my career as a mechanic, and associated with the most\ninteresting and active parts of my life.  I lovingly treasured them,\nand gave them an honoured place in the workshop which I added to my\nresidence.  There they are now, and I often spend a busy and delightful\nhour in handling my tools.  It is curious how the mere sight of such\nobjects brings back to the memory bygone incidents and recollections.\nFriends long dead seem to start up while looking at them.  You almost\nfeel as if you could converse with the departed.  I do not know of\nanything so touchingly powerful in vividly bringing back the treasured\nincidents and memories of one's life as the sight of such humble\nobjects.  Every one has, no doubt, a treasured store of such material\nrecords of a well-remembered portion of his past life. These strike,\nas it were, the keynote to thoughts that bring back in vivid form the\nmost cherished remembrances of our lives.  On many occasions I have\nseen at sale rooms long treasured hoards of such objects thrown\ntogether in a heap as mere rubbish.  And yet these had been to some the\nsources of many pleasant thoughts and recollections, But the last final\nbreak-up has come, and the personal belongings of some departed kind\nheart are scattered far and wide.  These touching relics of a long\nlife, which had almost become part of himself, are \"knocked down\" to\nthe lowest class of bidders.  It is a sad sight to witness the uncared\nfor dispersion of such objects--objects that had been lovingly stored\nup as the most valued of personal treasures. I could have wished that,\nas was the practice in remote antiquity, such touching relics were\nburied with the dead, as their most fitting repository.  Then they\nmight have left some record, instead of being desecrated by the harpies\nwho wait at sales for such \"job lots.\"\n\nBehold us, then, settled down at Hammerfield for life.  We had plenty\nto do.  My workshop was fully equipped.  My hobbies were there,\nand I could work them to my heart's content.  The walls of our various\nrooms were soon hung with pictures, and other works of art, suggestive\nof many pleasant associations of former days.  Our library book-case\nwas crowded with old friends, in the shape of books that had been read\nand re-read many times, until they had become almost part of ourselves.\nOld Lancashire friends made their way to us when \"up in town,\"\nand expressed themselves delighted with our pleasant house and its\nbeautiful surroundings.\n\nThe continuous planting of the shrubs and trees gave us great pleasure.\nThose already planted had grown luxuriantly, fed by the fertile soil\nand the pure air.  Indeed, in course of time they required the\njudicious use of the axe in order to allow the fittest to survive and\ngrow at their own free will.  Trees contrive to manage their own\naffairs without the necessity of much labour or interference.\nThe \"survival of the fittest\" prevails here as elsewhere.  It is always\na pleasure to watch them.  There are many ordinary old-fashioned\nroadside flowering plants which I esteem for their vigorous beauty,\nand I enjoy seeing them assume the careless grace of Nature.\n\nThe greenhouse is also a source of pleasure, especially to my dear\nwife.  It is full of flowers of all kinds, of which she is devotedly\nfond.  They supply her with subjects for her brush or her needle.\nShe both paints them and works them by her needle in beautiful forms\nand groups.  This is one of her many favourite hobbies.  All this is\nsuitable to our fireside employments, and makes the days and the\nevenings pass pleasantly away.\n\n\nCHAPTER 21.  Active leisure.\n\nWhen James Watt retired from business towards the close of his useful\nand admirable life, he spoke to his friends of occupying himself with\n\"ingenious trifles,\" and of turning \"some of his idle thoughts\" upon\nthe invention of an arithmetical machine and a machine for copying\nsculpture.  These and other useful works occupied his attention for\nmany years.\n\nIt was the same with myself.  I had good health (which Watt had not)\nand abundant energy.  When I retired from business I was only\nforty-eight years old, which may be considered the prime of life.\nBut I had plenty of hobbies, perhaps the chief of which was Astronomy.\nNo sooner had I settled at Hammerfield than I had my telescopes brought\nout and mounted.  The fine clear skies with which we were favoured,\nfurnished me with abundant opportunities for the use of my instruments.\nI began again my investigations on the Sun and the Moon, and made some\noriginal discoveries, of which more anon.\n\nEarly in the year 1858 I received a pressing invitation from the\nCouncil of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society to give a lecture before\ntheir members on the Structure of the Lunar Surface.  As the subject\nwas a favourite one with me, and as I had continued my investigations\nand increased my store of drawings since I had last appeared before an\nEdinburgh audience, I cheerfully complied with their request.\nI accordingly gave my lecture before a crowded meeting in the\nQueen Street Lecture Hall.\n\nThe audience appeared to be so earnestly interested by the subject that\nI offered to appear before them on two successive evenings and give any\nviva voce explanations about the drawings which those present might\ndesire.  This deviation from the formality of a regular lecture was\nattended with the happiest results.  Edinburgh always supplies a\nhighly-intelligent audience, and the cleverest and brightest were ready\nwith their questions.  I was thus enabled to elucidate the lecture and\nto expand many of the most interesting points connected with the moon's\nsurface, such as might formerly have appeared obscure.  These questioning\nlectures gave the highest satisfaction.  They satisfied myself as well\nas the audience, who went away filled with the most graphic information\nI could give them on the subject.\n\nBut not the least interesting part of my visit to Edinburgh on this\noccasion was the renewed intercourse which I enjoyed with many of my\nold friends.  Among these were my venerable friend Professor Pillans,\nCharles Maclaren (editor of the Scotsman), and Robert Chambers.\nWe had a long  dander together through the Old Town, our talk being in\nbroad Scotch.  Pillans was one of the fine old Edinburgh Liberals,\nwho stuck to his principles through good report and through evil.\nIn his position as Rector of the High School, he had given rare\nevidence of his excellence as a classical scholar.  He was afterwards\npromoted to be a Professor in the University.  He had as his pupils\nsome of the most excellent men of my time.  Amongst his intimate\nfriends were Sydney Smith, Brougham, Jeffrey, Cockburn--men who gave\nso special a character to the Edinburgh society of that time.\n\nWe had a delightful stroll through some of the most remarkable parts of\nthe Old Town, with Robert Chambers as our guide.  We next mounted\nArthur's Seat to observe some of the manifestations of volcanic action,\nwhich had given such a remarkable structure to the mountain.\nOn this subject, Charles Maclaren was one of the best living expounders.\nHe was an admirable geologist, and had closely observed the features of\nvolcanic action round his native city.  Robert Chambers then took us to\nsee the glacial grooved rocks on another part of the mountain.\nOn this subject he was a master.  It was a vast treat to me to see\nthose distinct evidences of actions so remotely separated in point of\ngeological time--in respect to which even a million of years is a\nhumble approximate unit*\n [footnote...\n\"It is to our ever-dropping climate, with its hundred and fifty-two days\nof annual rain, that we owe our vegetable mould with its rich and\nbeauteous mantle of sward and foliage.  And next, stripping from off\nthe landscape its sands and gravels, we see its underlying boulder-clays,\ndingy and gray, and here presenting their vast ice-borne stones,\nand there its iceberg pavements.  And these clays in turn stripped away,\nthe bare rocks appear, various in colour and uneven in surface,\nbut everywhere grooved and polished, from the sea level and beneath it,\nto the height of more than a thousand feet, by evidently the same agent\nthat careered along the pavements and transported the great stones.\n\nHUGH MILLER'S Geological Features of Edinburgh and its Neighbourhood.\n ...]\n\nWhat a fine subject for a picture the group would have made! with the\ngreat volcanic summit of the mountain behind, the noble romantic city\nin the near distance, and the animated intelligent countenaces of the\ndemonstrators, with the venerable Pillans eagerly listening--for the\nProfessor was then in his eighty-eighth year.  I had the happiness of\nreceiving a visit from him at Hammerfield in the following year.\nHe was still hale and active; and although I was comparatively a boy to\nhim, he was as bright and clear-headed as he had been forty years before.\n\nIn the course of the same year I accompanied my wife and my sister\nCharlotte on a visit to the Continent.  It was their first sojourn in\nforeign parts.  I was able, in some respects, to act as their guide.\nOur visit to Paris was most agreeable.  During the three weeks we were\nthere, we visited the Louvre, the Luxembourg, Versailles, and the parts\nround about.  We made many visits to the Hotel Cluny, and inspected its\nmost interesting contents, as well as the Roman baths and that part of\nthe building devoted to Roman antiquities.  We were especially\ndelighted with the apartments of the Archbishop of Paris, now hung with\nfine old tapestry and provided with authentic specimens of mediaeval\nfurniture.  The quaint old cabinets were beautiful studies; and many\nartists were at work painting them in oil. Everything was in harmony.\nWhen the sun shone in through the windows in long beams of coloured\nlight, illuminating portions of the antique furniture, the pictures\nwere perfect.  We were much interested also by the chapel in which\nMary Queen of Scots was married to the Dauphin. It is still in complete\npreservation.  The Gothic details of the chapel are quite a study;\nand the whole of these and the contents of this interesting Museum form\na school of art of the best kind.\n\nFrom Paris we paid a visit to Chartres, which contains one of the most\nmagnificent cathedrals in France.  Its dimensions are vast,\nits proportions are elegant, and its painted glass is unequalled.\nNothing can be more beautiful than its three rose-windows.  But I am\nnot writing a guide-book, and I must forbear.  After a few days more at\nParis we proceeded south, and visited Lyons, Avignon, and Nismes, on\nour way to Marseilles.  I have already described Nismes in my previous\nvisit to France.  I revisited the Roman amphitheatre, the Maison Quarree,\nthat perfect Roman temple, which, standing as it does in an open\nsquare, is seen to full advantage.  We also went to see the magnificent\nRoman aqueduct at Pont du Gard.  The sight of the noble structure well\nrepays a visit.  It consists of three tiers of arches.  Its magnitude,\nthe skilful fitting of its enormous blocks, makes a powerful impression\non the mind.  It has stood there, in that solitary wooded valley,\nfor upwards of sixteen centuries; and it is still as well fitted for\nconveying its aqueduct of water as ever.  I have seen nothing to\ncompare with it, even at Rome.  It throws all our architectural buildings\ninto the shade.  On our way back from Marseilles to Paris we visited\nGrenoble and its surrounding beautiful Alpine scenery.\nThen to Chambery, and afterwards to Chamounix, where we obtained a\nsplendid view of Mont Blanc.  We returned home by way of Geneva and\nParis, vastly delighted with our most enjoyable journey.\n\nI return to another of my hobbies.  I had an earnest desire to acquire\nthe art and mystery of practical photography.  I bought the necessary\napparatus, together with the chemicals; and before long I became an\nexpert in the use of the positive and negative collodion process,\nincluding the printing from negatives, in all the details of that\nwonderful and delightful art.  To any one who has some artistic taste,\nphotography, both in its interesting processes and glorious results,\nbecomes a most attractive and almost engrossing pursuit.  It is a\ndelightful means of educating the eye for artistic feeling, as well as\nof educating the hands in delicate manipulation.  I know of nothing\nequal to photography as a means of advancing one's knowledge in these\nrespects.  I had long meditated a work \"On the Moon,\" and it was for\nthis purpose more especially that I was earnest in endeavouring to\nacquire the necessary practical skill.  I was soon enabled to obtain\nphotographic copies of the elaborate models of parts of the moon's,\nsurface, which I had long before prepared.  These copies were hailed by\nthe highest authorities in this special department of astronomical\nresearch as the best examples of the moon's surface which had yet been\nproduced.\n\nIn reference to this subject, as well as to my researches into the\nstructure of the sun's surface, I had the inestimable happiness of\nsecuring the friendship of that noble philosopher, Sir John Herschel.\nHis visits to me, and my visits to him, have left in my memory the most\ncherished and happy recollections.  Of all the scientific men I have\nhad the happiness of meeting, Sir John stands supremely at the head of\nthe list.  He combined profound knowledge with perfect humility.\nHe was simple, earnest, and companionable, He was entirely free from\nassumptions of superiority, and, still learning, would listen\nattentively to the humblest student.  He was ready to counsel and\ninstruct, as well as to receive information.  He would sit down in my\nworkshop, and see me go through the various technical processes of\ncasting, grinding, and polishing specula for reflecting telescopes.\nThat was a pleasure to him, and a vast treat to me.\n\nI had been busily occupied for some time in making careful investigations\ninto the dark spots upon the Sun's surface.  These spots are of\nextraordinary dimensions, sometimes more than 10,000 miles in diameter.\nOur world might be dropped into them.  I observed that the spots were\nsometimes bridged over by a streak of light, formed of\nwillow-leaf-shaped objects.  They were apparently possessed of\nvoluntary motion, and moved from one side of the spot to the other.\nThese flakes were evidently the immediate sources of the solar light\nand heat.  I wrote a paper on the subject, which I sent to the Literary\nand Philosophical Society of Manchester.*\n [footnote...\nMemoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester,\n3d series, vol. i. p. 407.  My first discovery of the \"Willow-leaf\"\nobjects on the Sun's surface was made in June 1860.I afterwards\nobtained several glimpses of them from time to time.But the occasions\nare very rare when the bright sun can be seen in a tranquil atmosphere\nfree from vibrations, and when the delicate objects on its surface can\nbe clearly defined.  It was not until the 5th of June 1864 that I\nobtained the finest sight of the Sun's spots and the Willow-leaf objects;\nit was then that I made a careful drawing of them, from which the\nannexed faithful engraving has been produced.  Indeed I never had a\nbetter sight of this extraordinary aspect of the Sun than on that day.\n ...]\n\nThe results of my observations were of so novel a character that\nastronomers for some time hesitated to accept them as facts.\nYet Sir John Herschel, the chief of astronomers, declared them to be\n\"a most wonderful discovery\"\n\n[Image]  Group of sun spots as seen by James Nasmyth, 5th June 1864.\n\nI received a letter from Sir John, dated Collingwood, 2lst of May 1861,\nin which he said:\n\n\"I am very much obliged to you for your note, and by the sight of your\ndrawings, which Mr. Maclaren was so kind as to bring over here the\nother day.  I suppose there can be no doubt as to the reality of the\nwillow-leaved flakes, and in that case they certainly are the most\nmarvellous phenomena that have yet turned up--had almost said in all\nNature--certainly in all Astronomy.\n\n\"What can they be?  Are they huge phosphorised fishes?  If so, what\nmonsters!  Or are they crystals? a kind of igneous snow-flakes?\nfloating in a fluid of their own, or very nearly their own, specific\ngravity?  Some kind of solidity or coherence they must have, or they\nwould not retain their shape in the violent movements of the atmosphere\nwhich the change of the spots indicate.\n\n\"I observe that in the bridges all their axes have an approximate\nparallelism, and that in the penumbra they are dispersed, radiating\nfrom the inside and the outside of the spot, giving rise to that\nstriated appearance which is familiar to all observers of the spots.\n\n\"I am very glad that you have pitched your tent in this part of the\nworld, and I only wish it were a little nearer.  You will anyhow have\nthe advantage at Penshurst of a much clearer atmosphere than in the\nnorth; but here, nearer the coast, I think we are still better off.\n\"Mr. Maclaren holds out the prospect of our meeting you at Pachley at\nno distant period, and I hope you will find your way ere long to\nCollingwood.  I have no instruments or astronomical apparatus to show\nyou, but a remarkably pretty country, which is beginning to put on\n(rather late) its gala dress of spring?'\n\nSir John afterwards requested my permission to insert in his\nOutlines of Astronomy, of which a new edition was about to appear, a\nrepresentation of \"the willow-leaved structure of the Sun's surface,\"\n--which had been published in the Manchester transactions,--to which\nI gladly gave my assent.  Sir John thus expresses himself on the\nsubject: --\"The curious appearance of the 'pores' of the Sun's surface\nhas lately received a most singular and unexpected interpretation from\nthe remarkable discovery of Mr. J. Nasmyth, who, from a series of\nobservations made with a reflecting telescope of his own construction\nunder very high magnifying powers, and under exceptional circumstances\nof tranquillity and definition, has come to the conclusion that these\npores are the polygonal interstices between certain luminous objects of\nan exceedingly definite shape and general uniformity of size,\nwhose form (at least as seen in projection in the central portions of\nthe disc) is that of the oblong leaves of a willow tree.  These cover\nthe whole disc of the Sun (except in the space occupied by spots) in\ncountless millions, and lie crossing each other in every imaginable\ndirection....  This most astonishing revelation has been confirmed to a\ncertain considerable extent, and with some modifications as to the form\nof the objects, their exact uniformity of size and resemblance of\nfigure, by Messrs.  De la Rue, Pritchard and Stone in England,\nand M. Secchi in Rome.\"\n\nOn the 25th of February 1864, I received a communication from\nMr. E. J. Stone, first assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.\n\nThe Astronomer-Royal, he said, \"has placed in my hands your letter of\nFebruary 20.  Your discovery of the 'willow leaves' on the Solar\nphotosphere having been brought forward at one of the late meetings of\nthe Royal Astronomical Society, my attention was attracted to the\nsubject.  At my request, the Astronomer-Royal ordered of Mr. J. Simms a\nreflecting eye-piece for our great equatorial.  The eye-piece was\ncompleted about the end of January last, and at the first good\nopportunity I turned the telescope on the Sun.\n\n\"I may state that my impression was, and it appears to have been the\nimpression of several of the assistants here, that the willow leaves\nstand out dark against the luminous photosphere.  On looking at the\nSun, I was at once struck with the apparent resolvability of its\nmottled appearance.  The whole disc of the Sun, so far as I examined\nit, appeared to be covered over with relatively bright rice-like\nparticles, and the mottled appearance seemed to be produced by the\ninterlacing of these particles.\n\n\"I could not observe any particular arrangement of the particles, but\nthey appeared to be more numerous in some parts than in others.\nI have used the word 'rice-like' merely to convey a rough impression of\ntheir form.  I have seen them on two occasions since, but not so well\nas on the first day, when the definition was exceedingly good.\n\n\"on the first day that I saw them I called Mr Dunkin's attention to\nthem.  He appears to have seen them.  He says, however, that he should\nnot have noticed them if his attention had not been called to them.\"\n\nThe Astronomer Royal, in his report to the Admiralty on my discovery,\nsaid:\n\n\"an examination of the Sun's surface with the South-East Equatorial,\nunder favourable circumstances, has convinced me of the accuracy of the\ndescription, which compares it with interlacing willow leaves or rice\ngrains.\"\n\nIn March 1864 I received a letter from my friend De la Rue, dated from\nhis observatory at Cranford, Middlesex, in which he said:  \"I like good\nhonest doubting.  Before I had seen with my own eyes your willow\nleaves, I doubted their real existence, but I did not doubt your having\nseen what you had drawn.  But when I actually saw them for the first\ntime, I could not restrain the exclamation, ' Why, here are Nasmyth's\nwillow leaves! ' It requires a very fine state of the atmosphere to\npermit of their being seen, as I have seen them on three or four\noccasions, when their substantial reality can no longer be doubted.\"*\n [footnote...\nLet me give another letter from my friend, dated the Observatory,\nCranford, Middlesex, October 26, 1864.  He said:-\n\"I am quite pleased to learn that you like the large photograph.\nThe first given to my friend was destined for and sent to you.\nNo one has so great a claim on the fruit of my labours; for you\ninoculated me with the love of star-gazing, and gave me invaluable aid\nand advice in figuring specula.  I daresay you may remember the first\noccasion on which I saw a reflecting telescope, which was then being\ntried on the sun in a pattern loft at Patricroft.  You may also recall\nthe volumes you wrote in answer to my troublesome questions.\nYours very sincerely WARREN DE LA RUE.\"\n ...]\n\nSir John Herschel confirmed this information in a letter which I\nreceived from him in the following May.  He said \"that Mr. De la Rue\nand a foreign gentleman, Hugo Muller, had been very successful in\nseeing and delineating the 'willow leaves' They are represented by\nMr. M. as packed together on the edge of a spot, and appear rather like\na bunch of bristles or thorns.  In other respects the individual forms\nagree very well with your delineations.\"  Another observer had\ndiscovered a marvellous resemblance between the solar spots and the\nhollows left by the breaking and subsidence of bubbles, which rise when\noil varnish, which has moisture in it, is boiled, and the streaky\nchannels are left by the retiring liquid.  \"I cannot help,\" adds\nSir John, \"fancying a bare possibility of some upward outbreak,\nfollowed by a retreat of some gaseous matter, or some dilated portion\nof the general atmosphere struggling upwards, and at the same time\nexpanding outwards.  I can conceive of an up-surge of some highly\ncompressed matter, which relieved of pressure, will dilate laterally\nand upwards to an enormous extent (as Poullett Scrope supposes of his\nlavas full of compressed gases and steam), producing the spots, and,\nin that case, the furrows might equally well arise in the origination\nas in the closing in of a spot.\"\n\nI had the honour and happiness of receiving a visit from Sir John\nHerschel at my house at Hammerfield in the summer of 1864.\nHe was accompanied by his daughter.  They spent several days with us.\nThe weather was most enjoyable.  I had much conversation with Sir John\nas to the Sun spots and willow-leaf-shaped objects on the Sun's\nsurface, as well as about my drawings of the Moon.  I exhibited to him\nmy apparatus for obtaining sound castings of specula for reflecting\ntelescopes.  I compounded the alloy, melted it, and cast a 10-inch\nspeculum on my peculiar common-sense system.  I introduced the molten\nalloy, chilled it in a metal mould, by which every chance of flaws and\nimperfections is obviated.  I also showed him the action and results of\nmy machine, by which I obtained the most exquisite polish and figure\nfor the speculum.  Sir John was in the highest degree cognisant of the\nimportance of these details, as contributing to the final excellent\nresult.  It was therefore with great pleasure that I could exhibit\nthese practical details before so competent a judge.\n\nWe had a great set-to one day in blowing iridescent soap bubbles from a\nmixture of soap and glycerine.  Some of the bubbles were of about\nfifteen inches diameter.  By carefully covering them with a bell glass,\nwe kept them for about thirty-six hours, while they went through their\nchanges of brilliant colour, ending in deep blue.  I contrived this\nmethod of preserving them by placing a dish of water below, within the\ncovering bell glass, by means of which the dampness of the air\nprevented evaporation of the bubble.  This dodge of mine vastly\ndelighted Sir John, as it allowed him to watch the exquisite series of\niridescent tints at his tranquil leisure.\n\n[Image]  From a photograph of the Moon, exhibiting the bright radial\n         lines.\n\n[Image]  Glass globe cracked by internal pressure, in illustration of\n         the cause of the bright radial lines seen on the moon.\n\nI had also the pleasure of showing him my experiment of cracking a\nglass globe filled with water and hermetically sealed.  The water was\nthen slightly expanded, on which the glass cracked.  This was my method\nof explaining the nature of the action which, at some previous period\nof the cosmical history of the Moon, had produced those bright\nradiating lines that diverge from the lunar volcanic craters.\nSir John expressed his delight at witnessing my practical illustration\nof this hitherto unexplained subject, and he considered it quite\nconclusive.   I also produced my enlarged drawings of the Moon's\nsurface, which I had made at the side of my telescope.  These greatly\npleased him and he earnestly urged me to publish them, accompanied with\na descriptive account of the conclusions I had arrived at.\nI then determined to proceed with the preparations which I had already\nmade for my long contemplated work.\n\nAmong the many things that I showed Sir John while at Hammerfield, was\na piece of white calico on which I had got printed  one million spots.\n [footnote...\nAt a recent meeting of the Metropolitan Railway Company\nI exhibited one million of letters, in order to show the number of\npassengers (thirty-seven millions) that had been conveyed during the\nprevious twelve months.  This number was so vast that my method only\nhelped the meeting to understand what had been done in the way of\nconveyance.  Mr. Macdonald of the Times, supplied me with one million\ntype impressions, contained in sixty average columns of the Times\nnewspaper.\n ...]\n\nThis was for the purpose of exhibiting one million in visible form.\nIn astronomical subjects a million is a sort of unit, and it occurred\nto me to show what a million really is.  Sir John was delighted and\nastonished at the sight.  He went carefully over the outstretched piece\nwith his rule, measured its length and breath, and verified its\ncorrectness.\n\nI also exhibited to him a diagram, which I had distributed amongst the\ngeologists at the meeting of the British Association at Ipswich in\n1851, showing a portion of the earth's curve, to the scale of one-tenth\nof an inch to a mile.  I set out the height of Mont Blanc, Etna, and\nalso the depth of the deepest mine, as showing the almost incredible\nminimum of knowledge we possess about even the merest surface of the\nglobe.  This diagram was hailed by many as of much value, as conveying\na correct idea of the relative magnitude of geological phenomena in\ncomparison with that of the earth itself:\n\nOn this subject Sir Thomas Mitchell, Surveyor-General of Australia,\nwrote to me at the time:  \"I will not obtrude upon you my crude notions\nof my own, but merely say that you could not have sent the 'Geological\nStandard Scale' to one who better deserved it, if the claim in such\nfavour is, as I suppose, to be estimated by the amount of the time of\none whole life, applied to the survey of great mountain ranges, and\ncoasts, rivers, etc.  By this long practice of mine, you may know how\nappreciable this satisfactory standard scale is to your humble servant.\n\nIn the winter of 1865 I visited Italy.  While at Rome, in April, I had\nthe pleasure of meeting Otto W. von Struve, the celebrated Russian\nastronomer.  He invited me to accompany him on a visit to Father Secchi\nat his fine observatory of the Collegio Romano.  I accepted the\ninvitation with pleasure.  We duly reached the Observatory when Struve\nintroduced me to the Father.  Secchi gave me a most cordial and\nunlooked-for welcome.  \"This,\" he said, \"is a most extraordinary\ninterview; as I am at this moment making a representation of your\nwillow-leaf-shaped constituents of the Solar surface!\"  He then pointed\nto a large black board, which he had daubed over with glue and was\nsprinkling over ( when we came in) with rice grains \"That,\" said he,\n\"is what I feel to be a most excellent representation of your discovery\nas I see it, verified by the aid of my telescope.\"  It appeared to\nFather Secchi so singular a circumstance that I should come upon him in\nthis sudden manner, while he was for the first time engaged in\nrepresenting what I had (on the spur of the moment when first seeing\nthem) described as willow-leaf-shaped objects.  I thought that his\nrepresentation of them, by scattering rice grains over his glue-covered\nblack board, was apt and admirable; and so did Otto Struve.\nThis chance meeting with these two admirable astronomers was one of the\nlittle bits of romance in my life.\n\nI returned to England shortly after.  Among our visitors at Hammerfield\nwas Lord Lyndhurst.  He was in his ninetieth year when he paid a visit\nto Tunbridge Wells.  Charles Greville, Secretary to the Privy Council,\nwrote to me, saying that his Lordship complained much of the want of\nsociety, and asked me to call upon him.  I did so, and found him\ncheerful and happy.\n\nI afterwards sent him a present of some of my drawings.  He answered:\n\"A thousand thanks for the charming etchings.  I am especially\ninterested in Robinson Crusoe.  He looks very comfortable, but I can't\nsee his bed, which troubles me.  The election ('Everybody for ever!')\nis wonderful.  I should not like to be there.  I hope we shall go to\nyou again one of these days, and have another peep into that wonderful\ntelescope.\"\n\nTo return to Sir John Herschel, We returned his visit at his house at\nCollingwood, near Hawkhurst.  I found him in the garden, down upon his\nknees, collecting crocus bulbs for next year's planting.  Like myself,\nhe loved gardening, and was never tired of it.  I mention this as an\ninstance of his simple zeal in entering practically into all that\ninterested him.  At home he was the happy father and lover of his\nfamily.  One of his favourite pastimes, when surrounded by his children\nin the evening, was telling them stories.  He was most happy and\nentertaining in this tranquil occupation.  His masterly intellect could\ngrasp the world and all its visible contents, and yet descend to\nentertain his children with extemporised tales.  He possessed\ninformation of the most varied kind, which he communicated with perfect\nsimplicity and artlessness!  His profound astronomical knowledge was\ncombined with a rich store of mechanical and manipulative faculty,\nwhich enabled him to take a keen interest in all the technical arts\nwhich so materially aid in the progress of science.  I shall never\nforget the happy days that he spent with me in my workshop.  His visits\nhave left in my mind the most cherished recollections.  Our friendly\nintercourse continued unbroken to the day of his death.  The following\nis the last letter I received from him:\n\nCOLLINGWOOD, March 10, 1871.\n\"MY DEAR SIR--A great many thanks for the opportunity of seeing your\nmost exquisite photographs from models of lunar mountains.  I hope you\nwill publish them.  They will create quite an electric sensation.\nWould not one or two specimens of the apparently nonvolcanic mountain\nranges, bordering on the great plains, add to the interest?   Excuse my\nwriting more, as I pen this lying on my back in bed, to which a fierce\nattack of bronchitis condemns me.  With best regards to Mrs. Nasmyth,\nbelieve me yours very truly,\n\n\" J. F. W. HERSCHEL.\"\n\nScientific knowledge seems to travel slowly, It was not until the year\n1875, more than fourteen years after my discovery of the willow-leaved\nbridges over the Sun's spots that I understood they had been accepted\nin America.  I learned this from my dear friend William Lassell.\nHis letter was as follows: --\"I see the Americans are appreciating\nyour solar observations.  A communication I have lately received from\nthe Alleghany Observatory remarks 'that he (Mr. Nasmyth) appears to\nhave been the first to distinctly call attention to the singular\nindividuality of the minute components of the photosphere; and this\nseems in fairness to entitle him to the credit of an important\ndiscovery, with which his name should remain associated.'\"\n\nI proceeded to do that which Sir John Herschel had so earnestly\nrecommended, that is, to write out my observations on the Moon.\nIt was a very serious matter, for I had never written a book before.\nIt occupied me many years, though I had the kind assistance of my\nfriend James Carpenter, then of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.\nThe volcanoes and craters, and general landscape scenery of the Moon,\nhad to be photographed and engraved, and this caused great labour.\n\nAt length the book, entitled The Moon, considered as a Planet, a World,\nand a Satellite, appeared in November 1874.  It was received with much\nfavour and passed into a second edition.  A courteous and kind review\nof the book appeared in the Edinburgh; and the notices in other\nperiodicals were equally favourable.  I dedicated the volume to the\nDuke of Argyll, because I had been so long associated with him in\ngeological affairs, and also because of the deep friendship which I\nentertained for his Grace.  I presented the volume to him as well as to\nmany other of my astronomical friends.  I might quote their answers at\ngreat length, from the Astronomer-Royal downwards.  But I will quote\ntwo--one from a Royal Academician and another from a Cardinal.\nThe first was from Philip H. Calderon.  He said:\n\n\"Let me thank you many times for your kind letter, and for your\nglorious book.  It arrived at twelve to-day, and there has been no\npainting since.  Once having taken it up, attracted by the\nillustrations, I could not put it down again.  I forgot everything;\nand, indeed, I have been up in the Moon.  As soon as these few words of\nthanks are given, I am going up into the Moon again.  What a comfort it\nis to read a scientific work which is quite clear, and what a gift it\nis to write thus!\n\n\"The photographs took my breath away.  I could not understand how you\ndid them, and your explanation of how you built the models from your\ndrawings only changed the wonder into admiration.  Only an artist could\nhave said what you say about the education of the eye and of the hand.\nYou may well understand how it went home to me.  Ever gratefully yours,\n\nPHILIP H.  CALDERON.\"\n\nI now proceed to the Cardinal.  I was present at one of the receptions\nof the President of the Royal Society at Burlington House, when I was\nintroduced to Cardinal Manning as \"The Steam Hammer!\"  After a cordial\nreception he suddenly said, \"But are you not also the Man in the Moon?\"\nYes, your Eminence.  I have written a book about the Moon, and I shall\nbe glad if you will accept a copy of it?\"  \"By all means,\" he said,\n\"and I thank you for the offer very much.\"  I accordingly sent the copy,\nand received the following answer:\n\n\"MY DEAR MR.NASMYTH--When I asked you to send me your book on the\nMoon, I had no idea of its bulk and value, and I feel ashamed of my\nimportunity, yet more than half delighted at my sturdy begging.\n\n\"I thank you for it very sincerely.  My life is one of endless work,\nleaving me few moments for reading.  But such books as yours refresh me\nlike a clover field.\n\n\"I hope I may have an opportunity of renewing our conversation.\nBelieve me always truly yours, HENRY, CARDINAL MANNING.\"\n\nI may also mention that I received a charming letter from Miss Herschel,\nthe daughter of the late Astronomer.\n\n\"Is it possible,\" she said, \"that this beautiful book is destined by\nyou as a gift to my most unworthy self?  I do not know, indeed, how\n sufficiently to thank you, or even to express my delight in being\npossessed of so exquisite and valuable a work, made so valuable, too,\nby the most kind inscription on the first page!  I fear I shall be very\nvery far from understanding the theories developed in the book, though\nwe have been endeavouring to gather some faint notion of them from the\nreviews we have seen; but it will be of the greatest interest for us to\ntry and follow them under your guidance, and with the help of these\nperfectly enchanting photographs, which, I think, one could never be\ntired of looking at.\n\n\"How well I remember the original photographs, and the oil painting\nwhich you sent for dear papa's inspection, and which he did so enjoy!\nand also the experiment with the glass globe, in which he was so\ninterested, at your own house.  We cannot but think how he would have\nappreciated your researches, and what pleasure this lovely book would\nhave given him.  Indeed, I shall treasure it especially as a\nremembrance of that visit, which is so completely connected in my\nthoughts with him, as well as with your cordial kindness, as a precious\nsouvenir, of which let me once more offer you my heartfelt thanks.\nI remain, my dear sir, yours very truly and gratefully,\n\n\"ISABELLA HERSCHEL.\"\n\nI cannot refrain from adding the communication I received from my dear\nold friend William Lassell.  \"I do not know,\" he said,\n\"how sufficiently to thank you for your most kind letter, and the\nsuperb present which almost immediately followed it.  My pleasure was\ngreatly enhanced by the consideration of how far this splendid work\nmust add to your fame and gratify the scientific world.\nThe illustrations are magnificent, and I am persuaded that no book has\never been published before which gives so faithful, accurate,\nand comprehensive a picture of the surface of the Moon.  The work must\nhave cost you much time, thought, and labour, and I doubt not you will\nnow receive a gratifying, if not an adequate reward.\"\n\nAfter reading the book Mr. Lassell again wrote to me.  \"I am indebted\nto your beautiful book, \"he said, \"for a deeper interest in the Moon\nthan I ever felt before....  I see many of your pictures have been\ntaken when the Moon was waning, which tells me of many a shivering\nexposure you must have had in the early mornings,...  I was sorry to\nfind from your letter that you had a severe cold, which made you very\nunwell.  I hope you have ere this perfectly recovered.  I suppose\nmaladies of this kind must be expected to take rather severe hold of us\nnow, as we are both past the meridian of life.  I am, however,\nvery thankful for the measure of health I enjoy, and the pleasure\nmechanical pursuits give me.  I fully sympathise with you in the\ncontempt (shall I say?) which you feel for the taste of so many people\nwho find their chief pleasure in 'killing something,' and how often\ntheir pleasures are fatal!  Two distinguished men killed only the other\nday in hunting.  For my part I would rather take to the bicycle and do\nmy seventeen miles within the hour.\"\n\nHe proceeds:  \"I have no doubt your windmill is very nicely contrived,\nand has afforded you much pleasure in constructing it.\nThe only drawback to it is, that in this variable climate it is apt to\nstrike work, and in the midst of a job of polishing I fear no increase\nof wages would induce it to complete its task!  If water were plentiful,\nyou might make it pump up a quantity when the wind served, to be used\nas a motive power when you chose.\"\n\nThis reference alludes to a windmill which I erected on the top of my\nworkshop, to drive the apparatus below.  It was the mirror of a\nreflecting telescope which was in progress.  The windmill went on night\nand day, and polished the speculum while I slept.  In the small hours\nof the morning I keeked through the corner of the window blinds and saw\nit hard at work.  I prefer, however, a small steam-engine, which works\nmuch more regularly.\n\nIt is time to come to an end of my Recollections.  I have endeavoured\nto give a brief resume of my life and labours.  I hope they may prove\ninteresting as well as useful to others.  Thanks to a good constitution\nand a frame invigorated by work, I continue to lead, with my dear wife,\na happy life.  I still take a deep interest in mechanics, in astronomy,\nand in art.  It is a pleasure to me to run up to London and enjoy the\ncollections at the National Gallery, South Kensington, and the Royal\nAcademy.  The Crystal Palace continues to attract a share of my\nattention, though, since the fire, it has been greatly altered.\nI miss, too, many of the dear accustomed faces of the old friends we\nused to meet there.  Still we visit it, and leave to memory the filling\nup of what is gone.  All things change, and we with them.\nThe following Dial of Life gives a brief summary of my career.\nIt shows the brevity of life, and indicates the tale that is soon told.\nThe first part of the semicircle includes the passage from infancy to\nboyhood and manhood.  While that period lasts, time seems to pass very\nslowly.  We long to be men, and doing men's work.  What I have called\nThe Tableland of Life is then reached.  Ordinary observation shows that\nbetween thirty and fifty the full strength of body and mind is reached;\nand at that period we energise our faculties to the utmost.\n\n[Image]  The Dial of Life\n\nThose who are blessed with good health and a sound constitution may\nprolong the period of energy to sixty or even seventy; but Nature's\nlaws must be obeyed, and the period of decline begins, and goes on with\naccelerated rapidity.  Then comes Old Age; and as we descend the\nsemicircle towards eighty, we find that the remnant of life becomes\nvague and cloudy.  By shading off, as I have done, the portion of the\narea of the diagram according to the individual age, every one may see\nhow much of life is consumed, and what is left--D.V..

A mode of applying Steam Power for the Traction of Canal Barges,\n      without injury to the Canal Banks.\n\nA CANAL having been formed to connect Edinburgh with the Forth and\nClyde Canal, and so to give a direct waterway communication between\nEdinburgh and Glasgow, I heard much talk about the desirableness of\nsubstituting Steam for Horse power as the means of moving the boats and\nbarges along the canal.  But, as the action of paddle wheels had been\nfound destructive to the canal banks, no scheme of that nature could be\nentertained.  Although a tyro in such matters, I made an attempt to\nsolve the problem, and accordingly prepared drawings, with a\ndescription of my design, for employing Steam power as the tractive\nagency for trains of canal barges, in such a manner as to obviate all\nrisk of injury to the banks.\n\n[Image]\n\nThe scheme consisted in laying a chain along the bottom of the canal,\nand of passing any part of its length between three grooved and notched\npulleys or rollers, made to revolve with suitable velocity by means of\na small steam-engine placed in a tug-boat, to the stern of which a\ntrain of barges was attached.*\n [footnote...\nHad this simple means of \"tugging\" vessels through water-ways been\nemployed in our late attempts to ascend the rapids of the Nile, some\nvery important results might have issued from its adoption.\n ...]\nThe steam-engine could thus warp its way along the chain, taking it up\nbetween the rollers of the bow of the tug-boat, and dropping it into\nthe water at the stern, so as to leave the chain at the service of the\nnext following tug-boat with its attached train of barges.  By this\nsimple mode of employing the power of a steam-engine for canal boat\ntraction, all risk of injury to the banks would be avoided, as the\nchain and not the water of the canal was the fulcrum or resistance\nwhich the steam-engine on the tug-boat operated upon in thus warping\nits way along the chain; and thus effectually, without slip or other\nwaste of power, dragging along the train of barges attached to the\nstern of the steam-tug.  I had arranged for two separate chains,\nso as to allow trains of barges to be conveyed along the canal in\nopposite directions, without interfering with each other.\n\nI submitted a complete set of drawings, and a full description of my\ndesign in all its details, to the directors of the Canal Company;\nand I received a complimentary acknowledgment of them in writing.  But\nsuch was the prejudice that existed, in consequence of the injury to\nthe canal banks resulting from the use of paddle Wheels, that it\nextended to the use of steam power in any form, as a substitute for\nordinary horse traction; and although I had taken every care to point\nout the essential difference of my system (as above indicated) by which\nall such objections were obviated, my design was at length courteously\ndeclined, and the old system of horse traction continued.\n\nIn 1845 I had the pleasure to see this simple mode of moving vessels\nalong a definite course in most successful action at the ferry across\nthe Hamoaze at Devonport, in which my system of employing the power of\na steam-engine on board the ferry boat, to warp its way along a\nsubmerged chain lying along the bottom of the channel from side to side\nof the ferry, was most ably carried out by my late excellent friend,\nJames Rendell, Esq., C.E., and is still, I believe, in daily action,\ngiving every satisfaction.\n\n\n1826. An Instrument for Measuring the Total and Comparative Expansion\n      of all Solid Bodies.\n\nMy kind friend and patron, Professor Leslie, being engaged in some\ninvestigations in which it was essential to know the exact comparative\ntotal expansion in bulk of metals and other solid bodies, under the\nsame number of degrees of heat, mentioned the subject in the course of\nconversation.  The instrument at that time in use was defective in\nprinciple as well as in construction, and the results of its\napplication were untrustworthy.  As the Professor had done me the honour\nto request me to assist him in his experiments, I had the happiness to\nsuggest an arrangement of apparatus which I thought might obviate the\nsources of error; and, with his approval, I proceeded to put it in\noperation.\n\nMy contrivance consisted of an arrangement by means of which the metal\nbar or other solid substance, whose total expansion under a given\nnumber of degrees of heat had to be measured, was in a manner itself\nconverted into a thermometer.  Absolutely equal bulks of each solid were\nplaced inside a metal tube or vessel, and surrounded with an exact\nequal quantity of water at one and the same normal temperature.\nA cap or cover, having a suitable length of thermometer tube attached\nto it, was then screwed down, and the water of the index tube was\nadjusted to the zero point of the scale attached to it, the whole being\nat say 50deg of heat, as the normal temperature in each case.  The\napparatus was then heated up to say 200deg by immersion in water at\nthat temperature.  The expansion of the enclosed bar of metal or other\nsolid substance under experiment caused the water to rise above the\nzero, and it was accordingly so indicated on the scale attached to the\ncap tube.  In this way we had a thermometer whose bulb was for the time\nbeing filled with the solid under investigation,--the water surrounding\nit imply acting as the means by which the expansion of each solid under\ntrial was rendered visible, and its amount capable of being ascertained\nand recorded with the utmost exactness, as the expansion of the water\nwas in every case the same, and also that of the instrument itself\nwhich was \"a constant quantity.\"\n\nIn this way we obtained the correct relative amount of expansion in\nbulk of all the solid substances experimented upon.  That each bar of\nmetal or other solid substance was of absolutely equal bulk, was\nreadily ascertained by finding that each, when weighed in water,\nlost the exact same weight.\n\n[Image]  James Nasmyth's Expansometer, 1826.\n\nMy friend, Sir David Brewster, was so much pleased with the instrument\nthat he published a drawing and description of it in the Edinburgh\nPhilosophical Journal, of which he was then editor.\n\n\n1827. A Method of increasing the Effectiveness of Steam by\n      super-heating it on its Passage from the Boiler to the Engine.\n\nOne or the earliest mechanical contrivances which I made was for\npreventing water, in a liquid form, from passing along with the steam\nfrom the boiler to the cylinder of the steam-engine.\nThe first steam-engine I made was employed in grinding oil colours for\nmy father's use in his paintings.  When I set this engine to work for\nthe first time I was annoyed by slight jerks which now and then\ndisturbed the otherwise smooth and regular action of the machine.\nAfter careful examination I found that these jerks were caused by the\nsmall quantities of water that were occasionally carried along with the\ncurrent of the steam, and deposited in the cylinder, where it\naccumulated above and below the piston, and thus produced the jerks.\n\nIn order to remove the cause of these irregularities, I placed a\nconsiderable portion of the length of the pipe which conveyed the steam\nfrom the boiler to the engine within the highly heated side flue of the\nboiler, so that any portion of water in the liquid form which might\nchance to pass along with the steam, might, ere it reached the\ncylinder, traverse this highly-heated steam pipe, and, in doing so,\nbe converted into perfectly dry steam, and in that condition enter the\ncylinder.  On carrying this simple arrangement into practice, I found\nthe result to be in every way satisfactory.  The active little\nsteam-engine thence-forward performed its work in the most smooth and\nregular manner.\n\nSo far as I am aware, this early effort of mine at mechanical\ncontrivance was the first introduction of what has since been termed\n\"super-heated steam\"--a system now extensively employed, and yielding\nimportant results, especially in the case of marine steam-engines.\nWithout such means of supplying dry steam to the engines, the latter\nare specially liable to \"break-downs,\" resulting from water,\nin the liquid form, passing into the cylinders along with the steam.\n\n\n1828. A Method of \"chucking\" delicate Metal-work, in order that it may\n      be turned with perfect truth\n\nIn fixing portions of work in the turning-lathe, one of the most\nimportant points to attend to is, that while they are held with\nsufficient firmness in order to be turned to the required form, they\nshould be free from any strain which might in any way distort them.\nIn strong and ponderous objects this can be easily accomplished by due\ncare on the part of an intelligent workman.  It is in operating by the\nlathe on delicate and flexible objects that the utmost care is\nrequisite in the process of chucking, as they are easily strained out\nof shape by fastening them by screws and bolts, or suchlike ordinary\nmeans.  This is especially the case with disc-like objects.  As I had on\nseveral occasions to operate in the lathe with this class of work I\ncontrived a method of chucking or holding them firm while receiving the\nrequired turning process, which has in all cases proved most handy and\nsatisfactory.\n\nThis method consisted of tinning three, or, if need be, more parts of\nthe work, and laying them down on a tinned face-plate or chuck,\nwhich had been heated so as just to cause the solder to flow.  As soon\nas the solder is cooled and set, the chuck with its attached work may\nthen be put in the lathe, and the work proceeded with until it is\ncompleted.  By again heating the chuck, by laying upon it a piece of\nred-hot iron, the work, however delicate, can be simply lifted off,\nand will be found perfectly free from all distortion.\n\nI have been the more particular in naming the use of three points of\nattachment to the chuck or face-plate, as that number is naturally free\nfrom any risk of distortion.  I have on so many occasions found the\ngreat value of this simple yet most secure mode of fixing delicate work\nin the lathe, that I feel sure that any one able to appreciate its\npractical value will be highly pleased with the results of its\nemployment.\n\nThe same means can, in many cases, be employed in fixing delicate work\nin the planing-machine.  All that is requisite is to have a clean-planed\nwrought-iron or brass fixing-plate, to which the work in hand can be\nattached at a few suitable parts with soft solder, as in the case of\nthe turning lathe above described.\n\n\n1828. A Method of casting Specula for Reflecting Telescopes, so as to\n      ensure perfect Freeness from Defects, at the same time enhancing\n      the Brilliancy of the Alloy.\n\nMy father possessed a very excellent achromatic spy-glass of 2 inches\ndiameter.  The object-glass was made by the celebrated Ramsden.\nWhen I was about fifteen I used it to gaze at the moon, planets, and\nsun-spots.  Although this instrument revealed to me the general\ncharacteristic details of these grand objects, my father gave me a\nwonderful account of what he had seen of the moon's surface by means of\na powerful reflecting telescope of 12 inches diameter, made by Short--\nthat justly celebrated pioneer of telescope making.  It had been erected\nin a temporary observatory on the Calton Hill, Edinburgh.  These\ndescriptions of my father's so fired me with the desire to obtain a\nsight of the glorious objects in the heavens through a more powerful\ninstrument than the spy-glass, that I determined to try and make a\nreflecting telescope which I hoped might in some degree satisfy my\nardent desires.\n\nI accordingly searched for the requisite practical instruction in the\npages of the Encyclopedia Britannica, and in other books that professed\nto give the necessary technical information on the subject.  I found,\nhowever, that the information given in books--at least in the books\nto which I had access was meagre and unsatisfactory.  Nevertheless I set\nto work with all earnestness, and began by compounding the requisite\nalloy for casting a speculum of 8 inches diameter.  This alloy consisted\nof 32 parts of copper, 15 parts of grain tin, and 1 part of white arsenic.\nThese ingredients, when melted together, yielded a compound metal which\npossessed a high degree of brilliancy.  Having made a wooden pattern for\nmy intended 8-inch diameter speculum, and moulded it in sand,\nI cast this my first reflecting telescope speculum according to the\nbest book instructions.  I allowed my casting to cool in the mould in\nthe slowest possible manner; for such is the excessive brittleness of\nthis alloy (though composed of two of the toughest of metals) that in\nany sudden change of temperature, or want of due delicacy in handling\nit, it is very apt to give way, and a fracture more or less serious is\nsure to result.  Even glass, brittle though it be, is strong in\ncomparison with speculum metal of the above proportions, though,\nas I have said, it yields the most brilliant composition.\n\nNotwithstanding the observance of all due care in respect of the\nannealing of the casting by slow cooling, and the utmost care and\ndelicate handling of it in the process of grinding the surface into the\nrequisite curve and smoothness suitable to receive the final polish,--\nI was on more than one occasion inexpressibly mortified by the sudden\ndisruption and breaking up of my speculum.  Thus many hours of anxious\ncare and labour proved of no avail.  I had to begin again and proceed\nda capo.  I observed, however, that the surplus alloy that was left in\nthe crucible, after I had cast my speculum, when again melted and\npoured out into a metal ingot mould, yielded a cake that, brittle\nthough it might be, was yet strong in comparison with that of the\nspeculum cast in the sand mould; and that it was also, judging from the\nfragments chipped from it, possessed of even a higher degree of\nbrilliancy.\n\nThe happy thought occurred to me of substituting an open metal mould\nfor the closed sand one.  I soon had the metal mould ready for casting.\nIt consisted of a base plate of cast iron, on the surface of which I\nplaced a ring or hoop of iron turned to fully the diameter of the\nintended speculum, so as to anticipate the contraction of the alloy.\nThe result of the very first trial of this simple metal mould was most\nsatisfactory.  It yielded me a very perfect casting: and it passed\nsuccessively through the ordeal of the first rough grinding, and\neventually through the processes of polishing, until in the end it\nexhibited a brilliancy that far exceeded that of the sand mould\ncastings.\n\nThe only remaining difficulty that I had to surmount was the risk of\ndefects in the surface of the speculum.  These sometimes result from the\nfirst splash  of the melted metal as it is poured into the ring mould.\nThe globules sometimes got oxidised before they became incorporated\nwith the main body of the inflowing molten alloy: and dingy spots in\nthe otherwise brilliant alloy were thus produced.  I soon mastered this,\nthe only remaining source of defect, by a very simple arrangement.\nIn place of pouring the melted alloy direct into the ring mould, I\nattached to the side of it what I termed a \"pouring pocket;\"\nwhich communicated with an opening at the lower edge of the ring,\nand by a self-acting arrangement by which the mould plate was slightly\ntilted up, the influx of the molten alloy advanced in one unbroken\ntide.  As soon as the entire surface of the mould plate was covered by\nthe alloy, its weight overcame that of my up-tilting counterpoise,\nand allowed the entire apparatus to resume its exact level.  The\nresulting speculum was, by these simple arrangements, absolutely\nperfect in soundness.  It was a perfect casting, in all respects worthy\nof the care and labour which I invested in its future grinding and\npolishing, and enabled it to perform its glorious duties as the grand\nessential part of a noble reflecting telescope!\n\n[Image]\n\nA.

D.\nCounterpoise, By which the chill plate is tilted up The largest figure\nin the engraving is the annealing tub of cast iron filled with sawdust,\nwhere the speculum is placed to cool as slowly as possible.\n\nThe rationale of the strength of specula cast in this metal mould\nsystem, as compared with the treacherous brittleness of those cast in\nsand moulds, arises simply from the consolidation of the molten metal\npool taking place first at the lower surface, next the metal base of\nthe mould--the yet fluid alloy above satisfying the contractile\nrequirements of that immediately beneath it; and so on in succession,\nuntil the last to consolidate is the top or upper stratum.\nThus all risk of contractile tension, which is so dangerously eminent\nand inherent in the case of sand-mould castings, made of so exceedingly\nbrittle an alloy as that of speculum metal, is entirely avoided.\nBy the employment of these simple and effective improvements in the art\nof casting the specula for reflecting telescopes, and also by the\ncontrivance and employment of mechanical means for grinding and\npolishing them, I at length completed my first 8-inch diameter\nspeculum, and mounted it according to the Newtonian plan.  I was most\namply rewarded for all the anxious labour I had gone through in\npreparing it, by the glorious views it yielded me of the wonderful\nobjects in the heavens at night.  My enjoyment was in no small degree\nenhanced by the pleasure it gave to my father, and to many intimate\nfriends.  Amongst these was Sir David Brewster, who took a most lively\nand special interest in all my labours on this subject.\n\nIn later years I resumed my telescope making enjoyments, as a\ndelightful and congenial relaxation from the ordinary run of my\nbusiness occupations.  I constructed several reflecting telescopes,\nof sizes from 10-inch to 20-inch diameter specula.  I had also the\npleasure of assisting other astronomical friends, by casting and\ngrinding specula for them.  Among these I may mention my late dear\nfriend William Lassell, and my excellent friend Warren de la Rue,\nboth of whom have indelibly recorded their names in the annals of\nastronomical science.  I know of no subject connected with the pursuit\nof science which so abounds with exciting and delightful interest as\nthat of constructing reflecting telescopes.  It brings into play every\nprinciple of constructive art, with the inexpressibly glorious reward\nof a more intimate acquaintance with the sublime wonders of the\nheavens, I communicated in full detail all my improvements in the art\nof casting, grinding, and polishing the specula of reflecting\ntelescopes, to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester,\nillustrating my paper with many drawings.  But as my paper was of\nconsiderable length, and as the illustrations would prove costly to\nengrave, it was not published in the Society's Transactions.  They are\nstill, however, kept in the library for reference by those who take a\nspecial interest in the subject.\n\n\n1829. A Mode of transmitting Rotary Motion by means of a Flexible\n      Shaft, formed of a Coiled Spiral Wire or Rod of Steel.\n\nWhile assisting Mr. Maudslay in the execution of a special piece of\nmachinery, in which it became necessary to have some holes drilled in\nrather inaccessible portions of the work in hand, and where the\nemployment of the ordinary drill was impossible, it occurred to me that\na flexible shaft, formed of a closely coiled spiral of steel wire,\nmight enable us to transmit the requisite rotary motion to a drill\nattached to the end of this spiral shaft.  Mr. Maudslay was much pleased\nwith the notion, and I speedily put it in action by a close coiled\nspiral wire of about two feet in length.\n\nThis was found to transmit the requisite rotary motion to the drill at\nthe end of the spiral with perfect and faithful efficiency.\nThe difficulty was got over, to Mr. Maudslay's great satisfaction.\n\nSo far as I am aware, such a mode of transmitting rotary motion was new\nand original.  The device was useful, and proved of essential service in\nother important applications.  By a suitably close coiled spiral steel\nwire I have conveyed rotary motion quite round an obstacle, such as is\nindicated in the annexed figure.\n\n[Image]\n\nIt has acted with perfect faithfulness from the winch handle at A to\nthe drill at B.  Any ingenious mechanic will be able to appreciate the\nvalue of such a flexible shaft in many applications.  Four years ago I\nsaw the same arrangement in action at a dentist's operating-room, when\na drill was worked in the mouth of a patient to enable a decayed tooth\nto be stopped.  It was said to be the last thing out in \"Yankee notions.\"\nIt was merely a replica of my flexible drill of 1829.\n\n1829. A Mode of cutting Square or Hexgonal Collares Nuts or Bolt-Heads\n      by means of a Revolving File or Cutter.\n\nThis method is refrered to, and drawings given, in the text,\npp.  141, 142.\n\n\n1829. A Investigation into the Origin and Mode of writing the Cuneiform\n      Character\n\nThis will be found described in the next and final chapter\n\n\n1836. A Machine for cutting the Key-Grooves in Metal Wheels and Belt\n      Pulleys, of ANY Diameter.\n\nThe fastening of wheels and belt pulleys to shafts, so as to enable\nthem to transmit rotary motion, is one of the most frequently-recurring\nprocesses in the construction of machinery.  This is best effected by\ndriving a slightly tapered iron or steel wedge, or \"key\" as it is\ntechnically termed, into a corresponding recess, or flat part of the\nshaft, so that the wheel and shaft thus become in effect one solid\nstructure.\n\nThe old mode of cutting such key-grooves in the eyes of wheels was\naccomplished by the laborious and costly process of chipping and\nfiling.  Maudslay's mortising machine, which he contrived for the Block\nmachinery, although intended originally to operate upon wood, contained\nall the essential principles and details required for acting on metals.\nMr. Richard Roberts, by some excellent modifications, enabled it to\nmortise or cut out the key-grooves in metal wheels, and this method\nsoon came into general use.  This machine consisted of a vertical slide\nbar, to the lower end of which was attached the steel mortising tool,\nwhich received its requisite up and down motion from an adjustable\ncrank, through a suitable arrangement of the gearing.  The wheel to be\noperated upon was fixed to a slide-table, and gradually advanced,\nso as to cause the mortising tool to take successive cuts through the\ndepth of the eye of the wheel, until the mortise or key-groove had\nattained its required depth.\n\nThe only drawback to this admirable machine was that its service was\nlimited in respect to admitting wheels whose half diameter did not\nexceed the distance from the back of the jaw of the machine to the face\nof the mortise tool; so that to give to this machine the requisite\nrigidity and strength to resist the strain on the jaw, due to the\nmortising of the key-grooves, in wheels of say 6 feet diameter,\na more massive and cumbrous frame work was required, which was most\ncostly in space as well as in money.\n\nIn order to obviate this inconvenience, I designed an arrangement of a\nkey-groove mortising machine.  It was capable of operating upon wheels\nof any diameter, having no limit to it capacity in that respect.\nIt was, at the same time, possessed in respect of the principle on\nwhich it was arranged, of the power of taking a much deeper cut,\nthere being an entire absence of any source of springing or elasticity\nin its structure.  This not only enabled the machine to perform its work\nwith more rapidity, but also with more precision.  Besides, it occupied\nmuch less space in the workshop, and did not cost above one-third of\nthe machines formerly in use.  It gave the highest satisfaction to those\nwho availed themselves of its effective Services.\n\n[Image]\n\nA comparison of Fig. 1--which represents the general arrangement of\nthe machine in use previous to the introduction of mine--with that of\nFig. 2, may serve to convey some idea of their relative sizes.  Fig. 1\nshows a limit to the admission of wheels exceeding 6 feet diameter,\nFig. 2 shows an unlimited capability in that respect.\n\n\n1836. An Instrument for finding and marking the Centres of Cylindrical\n      Rods or Bolts about to be turned on the Lathe.\n\nOne of the most numerous details in the structure of all classes of\nmachines is the bolts which serve to hold the various parts together.\nAs it is most important that each bolt fits perfectly the hole it\nbelongs to, it is requisite that each bolt should, by the process of\nturning, be made perfectly cylindrical.  In preparing such bolts,\nas they come from the forge, in order to undergo the process of\nturning, they have to be \"centred;\" that is, each end has to receive a\nhollow conical indent, which must agree with the axis of the bolt.\nTo find this in the usual mode, by trial and frequent error, is a most\ntedious process, and consumes much valuable time of the workman as well\nas his lathe.\n\n[Image]\n\nIn order to obviate the necessity for this costly process, I devised\nthe simple instrument, a drawing of which is annexed.  The use of this\nenabled any boy to find and mark with absolute exactness and rapidity\nthe centres of each end of bolts, or suchlike  objects.  All that was\nrequired was to place the body of the bolt in the V-shaped supports,\nand to gently cause it to revolve, pressing it longitudinally against\nthe steel-pointed marker, which scratched a neat small circle in the\ntrue centre or axis of the bolt.  This small circle had its centre\neasily marked by the indent of a punch, and the work was thus ready for\nthe lathe.  This humble but really important process was accomplished\nwith ease, rapidity, and great economy.\n\n\n1836. Improvement in Steam-Engine Pistons, and in Water and Air-Pump\n      Buckets, so as to lessen Friction and dispense with Packing.\n\nThe desire to make the pistons of steam-engines and air-pump buckets of\ncondensing engines perfectly steam and water tight has led to the\ncontrivance of many complex and costly constructions for the purpose of\npacking them.  When we take a commonsense view of the subject, we find\nthat in most cases the loss of power resulting from the extra friction\nneutralises the expected saving.  This is especially the case with the\nair-pump bucket of a condensing steam-engine, as it is in reality much\nmore a water than an air pump.  But when it is constructed with a deep\nwell-fitted bucket, entirely without packing, the loss sustained by\nsuch an insignificant amount of leakage as may occur from the want of\npacking is more than compensated by the saving of power resulting from\nthe total absence of friction.\n\nThe first condensing steam-engine to which I applied an air-pump\nbucket, entirely without packing, was the forty horsepower engine,\nwhich I constructed for the Bridgewater Foundry.  It answered its\npurpose so well that, after twenty years' constant working,\nthe air-pump cover was taken off, out of curiosity, to examine the\nbucket, when it was found in perfect order.  This system, in which I\ndispensed with the packing for air-pump buckets of condensing\nsteam-engines, I have also applied to the pistons of the steam\ncylinders, especially those of high-pressure engines of the smaller\nvertical construction, the stroke of which is generally short and\nrapid.  Provided the cylinder is bored true, and the piston is carefully\nfitted, and of a considerable depth in proportion to its diameter,\nsuch pistons will be found to perform perfectly all their functions,\nand with a total absence of friction as a direct result of the absence\nof packing.  By the aid of our improved machine tools, cylinders can now\nbe bored with such perfect accuracy, and the pistons be fitted to them\nwith such absolute exactness, that the small quantity of water which\nthe steam always deposits on the upper side of the piston, not only\nserves as a frictionless packing, but also serves as a lubricant of the\nmost appropriate kind.  I have applied the same kind of piston to\nordinary water-pumps, with similar excellent results.  In most cases of\nright packed pistons we spend a shilling--to save sixpence--\na not unfrequent result of \"so-called\" refined improvements.\n\n\n1836. An instantaneous Mode of producing graceful Curves, suitable for\n      designing Vases and other graceful objects in Pottery and Glass.\n\nThe mode referred to consists in giving a rapid \"switch\" motion to a\npencil upon a piece of paper, or a cardboard, or a smooth metal plate;\nand then cutting out the curve so produced, and employing it as a\npattern or \"template,\" to enable copies to be traced from it.\nWhen placed at equal distances, and at equal angles on each side of a\ncentral line, so as to secure perfect symmetry of form according to the\nnature of the required design, the beauty of these \"instantaneous\"\ncurves, as I term them, arises from the entire absence of any sudden\nvariation in their course.  This is due to the momentum of the hand when\n\"switching\" the pencil at a high velocity over the paper.\nBy such simple means was the beautiful curve produced, which is given\non the following page.  It was produced \"in a twinkling,\" if I may use\nthe term to express the rapidity with which it was \"switched.\"\nThe chief source of the gracefulness of these curves consists in the\nalmost imperceptible manner in which they pass in their course from one\ndegree of curvature into another.  I have had the pleasure of showing\nthis simple mode of producing graceful curves to several potters,\nwho have turned the idea to good account.  The illustrative figures on\nthe next page have all been drawn from \"templates\" whose curves were\n\"switched\" in the manner of Fig. A.\n\n[Image]\n\n\n1836. A Machine for planing the smaller or detail parts of Machinery,\n      whether Flat or Cylindrical.\n\nAlthough the introduction of the planing machine into the workshops of\nmechanical engineers yielded results of the highest importance in\nperfecting and economising the production of machinery generally, yet,\nas the employment of these valuable machine tools was chiefly intended\nto assist in the execution of the larger parts of machine manufacture,\na very considerable proportion of the detail parts still continued to\nbe executed by hand labour, in which the chisel and the file were the\nchief instruments employed.  The results were consequently very\nunsatisfactory, both as regards inaccuracy and costliness.\n\n[image]\n\nWith the desire of rendering the valuable services of the Planing\nMachine applicable to the smallest detail parts of machine manufacture,\nI designed a simple and compact modification of it, such as should\nenable any attentive lad to execute all the detail parts of the\nmachines in so unerring and perfect a manner as not only to rival the\nhand work of the most skilful mechanic, but also at such a reduced cost\nas to place the most active hand workman far into the background.\nThe contrivance I refer to is usually known as \"Nasmyth's Steam Arm.\"\nNone but those who have had ample opportunities of watching the process\nof executing the detail parts of machines, can form a correct idea of\nthe great amount of time that is practically wasted and unproductive,\neven when highly-skilled and careful workmen are employed.  They have so\nfrequently to stop working, in order to examine the work in hand,\nto use the straight edge, the square, or the calipers, to ascertain\nwhether they are \"working correctly.\"  During that interval, the work is\nmaking no progress: and the loss of time on this account is not less\nthan one-sixth of the working hours, and sometimes much more;\nthough all this lost time is fully paid for in wages.\n\n[Image]  Apparatus for enabling the machine to execute segmented work\n\nBut by the employment of such a machine as I describe, even when placed\nunder the superintendence of well-selected intelligent lads, in whom\nthe faculty of good sight and nicety of handling is naturally in a high\nstate of perfection, any deficiency in their physical strength is amply\ncompensated by these self-acting machines.  The factory engine supplies\nthe labour or the element of Force, while the machines perform their\nwork with practical perfection.  The details of machinery are thus\nturned out with geometrical accuracy, and are in the highest sense\nfitted to perform their intended purposes.\n\n\n1837.

Method of reversing the action of Slide Lathes.\n\nIn the employment of Slide Turning Lathes, it is of great advantage to\nbe able to reverse the motion of the Slide so as to enable the turning\ntool to cut towards the Head of the Lathe or away from it, and also to\nbe able to arrest the motion of the Slide altogether, while all the\nother functions of the lathe are continued in action.  All these objects\nare attained by the simple contrivance represented in the annexed\nillustration.\n\n[Image]\n\nIt consists of a lever E, moving on a stud-pin S, attached to the back\nof the head stock of the lathe T.  This lever carries two wheels of\nequal diameter marked B and G.  These wheels can pitch into a\ncorresponding wheel A, fixed on the back end of the lay spindle.\nWhen the handle of the lever E is depressed (as seen in the drawing)\nthe wheel B is in gear with wheel A.  while C is in gear with the\nslidescrew wheel D, and so moves the slide (say from the Head Stock of\nthe lathe).  On the other hand, when the lever E is elevated in position\nE\", wheel B is taken out of gear with A, while G is put in gear with A,\nand B is put in gear with D; and thus the Slide is caused to move\ntowards the Head Stock of the lathe.  Again, where it is desired to\narrest the motion of the Slide altogether, or for a time, as occasion\nmay require, the lever handle is put into the intermediate position E',\nwhich entirely severs the communication between A and D, and so arrests\nthe motion of the slide.  This simple contrivance effectually served all\nits purposes, and was adopted by many machine tool-makers and\nengineers.\n\n\n1838. Self-adjusting Bearings for the Shafts of Machinery\n\nA frequent cause of undue friction and heating of rapidly rotating\nmachinery arises from some inaccuracy or want of due parallelism\nbetween the rotating shaft or spindle and its bearing.  This is\noccasioned in most cases by some accidental change in the level of the\nsupports of the bearings.  Many of the bearings are situated in dark\nplaces, and cannot be seen.  There are others that are difficult of\naccess--as in the case of bearings of screw-propeller shafts.\nSerious mischief may result before the heating of the bearing proclaims\nits dangerous condition.  In some cases the timber work is set on fire,\nwhich may result in serious consequences.\n\nIn order to remove the cause of such serious mischief, I designed an\narrangement of bearing, which enabled it, and the shaft working in it,\nto mutually accommodate themselves to each other under all\ncircumstances, and thus to avoid the danger of a want of due and mutual\nparallelism in their respective axes.  This arrangement consisted in\ngiving to the exterior of the bearing a spherical form, so as, within\nmoderate limits, to allow it to accommodate itself to any such changes\nin regard to mutual parallelism, as above referred to.  In other cases,\nI employed what I may call Rocking centres, on which the Pedestal or\n\"Plumber Block\" rested; and thus supplied a self-adjusting means for\nobviating the evils resulting from any accidental change in the proper\nrelative position of the shaft and its bearing.  In all cases in which I\nintroduced this arrangement, the results were most satisfactory.\n\nIn the case of the bearings of Blowing Fans, in which the rate of\nrotation is naturally excessive, a spherical resting-place for the\nbearings enabled them to keep perfectly cool at the highest speed.\nThis was also the case in the driving apparatus for machine tools,\nwhich is generally fixed at a considerable height above the machine.\nThese spherical or self-adjusting bearings were found of great service.\nThe apparatus, being generally out of convenient reach, is apt to get\nout of order unless duly attended to.  But, whether or not, the saving\nof friction is in itself a reason for the adoption of such bearings.\nThis may appear a trifling technical matter of detail; but its great\npractical value must be my excuse for mentioning it.\n\n\n1838. Invention of Safety Foundry Ladle.\n\nThe safety ladle is described in the text, p.  202.\n\n\n1838. Invention of the Steam Ram\n\nMy invention was made at this early date, long before the attack by the\nsteam-ram Merrimac upon the Cumberland, and other ships, in Hampton Roads,\nUnited States.  I brought my plans and drawings under the notice of the\nAdmiralty in 1845; but nothing was done for many years.  Much had been\naccomplished in rendering our ships shot-proof by the application of\niron plates; but it appeared to me that not one of them could exist\nabove water after receiving on its side a single blow from an\niron-plated steam-ram of 2000 tons.  I said, in a letter to the Times,\n\"As the grand object of naval warfare is the destruction by the most\nspeedy mode of the ships of the enemy, why should we continue to\nattempt to attain this object by making small holes in the hull of the\nenemy when, by one single masterly crashing blow from a steam ram,\nwe can crush in the side of any armour-plated ship, and let the water\nrush in through a hole, 'not perhaps as wide as a church door or as\ndeep as a well, but 'twill serve'; and be certain to send her below\nwater in a few minutes.*\n [footnote...\nIn these days of armour-clad warships, when plates of enormous\nthickness are relied on as invulnerable, our Naval Constructors appear\nto forget that the actual structural strength of such ships depends on\nthe backing of the plates, which, be it ever so thick, would yield to\nthe cramming blow of a moderate-sized Ram.\n ...]\n\nI published my description of the steam ram and its apparatus in the\nTimes  of January 1853, and again addressed the Editor on the subject\nin April 1862.  General Sir John Burgoyne took up the subject,\nand addressed me in the note at the foot of this page.*\n [footnote...\nThe following is the letter of General Sir John Burgoyne:\n\nWAR OFFICE, PALL MALL, LONDON, 8th April 1862.\n\n\"General Sir John Burgoyne presents his compliments to Mr. Nasmyth,\nand was much pleased to find, by Mr. Nasmyth's letter in the Times of\nthis day, certain impressions that he has held for some time confirmed\nby so good an authority.  \"A difficulty seems to be anticipated by many\nthat a steamer used as a ram with high velocity, if impelled upon a\nheavy ship, would, by the revulsion of the sudden shock, be liable to\nhave much of her gear thrown entirely out of order, parts displaced,\nand perhaps the boilers burst.  Some judgment, however, may be formed on\nthis point by a knowledge of whether such circumstances have occurred\non ships suddenly grounding; and even so, it may be a question whether\nso great a velocity is necessary.  \"An accident occurred some twenty\nyears ago, within Sir John Burgoyne's immediate cognisance, that has\nled him particularly to consider the great power of a ship acting as a\nram.  A somewhat heavy steamer went, by accident or mismanagement, end\non to a very substantial wharf wall in Kingstown Harbour, Dublin Bay.\nThough the force of the blow was greatly checked through the measures\ntaken for that purpose, and indeed so much so that the vessel itself\nsuffered no very material injury, yet several of the massive granite\nstones of the facing were driven some inches in, showing the enormous\nforce used upon them.  \"Superior speed will be very essential to the\nsuccessful action of the ram; but by the above circumstance we may\nassume that even a moderate speed would enable great effects to be\nproduced, at least on any comparatively weak point of even ironclad\nships, such as the rudder.\"\n ...]\n\nIn June 1870, I received a letter from Sir E. J. Reed, containing the\nfollowing extracts: --\"I was aware previously that plans had been\nproposed for constructing unarmoured steam rams, but I was not\nacquainted with the fact that you had put forward so well-maturerd a\nscheme at so early a date; and it has given me much pleasure to find\nthat such is the case.  It has been a cause both of pleasure and\nsurprise to me to find that so long ago you incorporated into a design\nalmost all the features which we now regard as essential to ramming\nefficiency--twin screws and moderate dimensions for handiness,\nnumerous water-tight divisions for safety, and special strengthenings\nat the bow.  Facts such as these deserve to be put on record....\nMeanwhile accept my congratulations on the great skill and foresight\nwhich your ram-design displays.\"\n\nCollisions at sea unhappily afford ample evidence of the fatal\nefficiency of the ramming principle.  Even ironclad ships have not been\nable to withstand the destructive effect.  The Vanguard and the Kurfurst\n now lie at the bottom of the sea in consequence of an accidental\n\"end-on\" ram from a heavy ship going at a moderate velocity.  High speed\nin a Steam Ram is only desirable when the attempt is made to overtake\nan enemy's ship; but not necessary for doing its destructive work.\nA crash on the thick plates of the strongest Ironclad, from a Ram of\n2000 tons at the speed of four miles an hour, would drive them inwards\nwith the most fatal results.\n\n\n1839.

A Double-faced Wedge-shaped Sluice-Valve for Main Street\n      Water-pipes.\n\nThe late Mr. Wicksteed, engineer of the East London Water Company,\nhaving stated to me the inconvenience which had been experienced from\nthe defects in respect of water-tightness, as well as the difficulty of\nopening and closing the valves of the main water-pipes in the streets,\nI turned my attention to the subject.  The result was my contrivance of\na double-faced wedge-shaped sluice-valve, which combined the desirable\nproperty of perfect water-tightness with ease of opening and closing\nthe valve.\n\nThis was effected by a screw which raised the valve from its bearings\nat the first partial turn of the screw, after which there was no\nfurther resistance or friction, except the trifling friction of the\nscrew in its nut on the upper part of the sluice-valve.  When screwed\ndown again, it closed simultaneously the end of the entrance pipe and\nthat of the exit pipe attached to the valve case in the most effective\nmanner.\n\n[image]\n\nMr. Wicksteed was so much pleased with the simplicity and efficiency of\nthis valve that he had it applied to all the main pipes of his Company.\nWhen its advantages became known, I received many orders from other\nwater companies, and the valves have since come into general use.\nThe prefixed figure will convey a clear idea of the construction.\nThe wedge form of the double-faced valve is conspicuous as the\ncharacteristic feature of the arrangement.*\n [footnote...\nAt a meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers, May 23, 1883,\nwhen various papers were read on Waterworks, Mr. H. I. Marten observed\nin the course of the discussion: --\"It has been stated in Mr. Gamble's\npaper (on the waterworks of Port Elizabeth) that the sluice valves are\nof the usual pattern.  The usual patterns of the present day are in\nwonderful advance of those of thirty or forty years since.  The great\nimprovement originated with the introduction of 'the double-faced\nsluice-cock.' This sluice-cock, which had now superseded every other\ndescription, was the creation of Mr. James Nasmyth's inventive genius.\nMr. Marten said he well remembered the first reception of this useful\ninvention, as he happened at that time to be a pupil of Mr. Thomas\nWicksteed.  He was present when Mr. Wicksteed explained to Mr. Nasmyth\nthe want he had experienced of a sluice-cock for Waterworks purposes,\nwhich should shut and remain perfectly tight against a pressure coming\nfrom either side.  Mr. Marten had a lively recollection of the\ninstantaneous rapidity with which Mr. Nasmyth not only grasped but\nprovided for the requirement; so that almost by the time Mr. Wicksteed\nhad completed the statement of his want, Mr. Nasmyth had drawn upon the\nback of an old letter a rough sketch of the first double-faced\nsluice-cock; and in less than an hour had converted this rough sketch\ninto a full-sized working drawing; in the preparation of which it fell\nto Mr. Marten's lot to have the honour to assist.  In his\n'Autobiography' Mr. Nasmyth referred to the conversation with\nMr. Wicksteed, and introduced a print of the drawing made upon the\noccasion.  The invention has been of the greatest use to the Waterworks\nEngineer, especially in connection with the constant supply system, in\nwhich it frequently happened that the pressure was sometimes against\none face of the sluice-cock, and sometimes against the other.\"--\nSee Proceedings and Discussions of the Institution of Civil Engineers,\n1883, pp. 88, 89.\n ...]\n\n\n1839. A Hydraulic Mattress Press, capable of exerting a pressure of\n      Twenty thousand tons.\n\nBeing under the impression that there are many processes in the\nmanufacturing arts, in which a perfectly controllable compressing power\nof vast potency might be serviceable, I many years ago prepared a\ndesign of an apparatus of a very simple and easily executed kind,\nwhich would supply such a desideratum.  It was possessed of a range of\ncompressing or squeezing  power, which far surpassed anything of the\nkind that had been invented.  As above said, it was perfectly\ncontrollable; so as either to yield the most gentle pressure, or to\npossess the power of compressing to upwards of twenty thousand tons;\nthe only limit to its power being in the materials employed in its\nconstruction.\n\nThe principle of this enormously powerful compressing machine is\nsimilar to that of the Hydraulic Press; the difference consisting\nprincipally in the substitution of what I term a Hydraulic Mattress in\nplace of the cylinder and ram of the ordinary hydraulic press.\nThe Hydraulic Mattress consists of a square or circular water-tight\nvessel or flat bag formed of 1/2-inch thick iron or steel plates\nsecurely riveted together; its dimensions being, say 15 feet square by\n3 feet deep, and having semicircular sides, which form enables the\nupper flat part of the Mattress to rise say to the extent of 6 inches,\nwithout any injury to the riveted joints, as such a rise or alteration\nof the normal form of the semicircular sides would be perfectly\nharmless, and not exceed their capability of returning to their normal\ncurve when the 6-inch rise was no longer necessary, and the elevating\npressure removed.\n\n[image]\n\nThe action of this gigantic press is as follows.  The Mattress A A\nhaving been filled with water, an additional quantity is supplied by a\nforce pump, capable of forcing in water with a pressure of one ton to\nthe square inch; thus acting on an available surface of at least 144\nsquare feet surface--namely, that of the upper flat surface of the\nMattress.  It will be forced up by no less a pressure than twenty\nthousand tons, and transfer that enormous pressure to any article that\nis placed between the rising table of the press and the upper table.\nWhen any object less thick than the normal space is required to receive\nthe pressure, the spare space must be filled with a suitable set of\niron flat blocks, so as to subject the article to be pressed to the\nrequisite power.\n\nAs before stated, there may be many processes in the manufacturing arts\nin which such an enormous pressure may be useful; and this can be\naccomplished with perfect ease and certainty.  I trust that this account\nof the principles and construction of such a machine may suggest some\nemployment worthy of its powers.  In the general use of the Mattress\npress, it would be best to supply the pressure water from an\naccumulator, which should be kept constantly full by the action of\nsuitable pumps worked by a small steam-engine.  The great press would\nrequire the high-pressure water only now and then; so that it would not\nbe necessary to wait for the small pump to supply the pressure water\nwhen the Mattress was required to be in action.\n\n\n1840.

A Mode of turning Segmental Work in the Ordinary Lathe\n\nIn executing an order for twenty locomotive engines for the Great\nWestern Railway Company, there was necessarily a repetition of detail\nparts.  Many of them required the labour of the most skilful workmen,\nas the parts referred to did not admit of their being executed by the\nlathe or planing-machine in their ordinary mode of application.\nBut the cost of their execution by hand labour was so great, and the\nrisk of inaccuracy was so common (where extreme accuracy was essential),\nthat I had recourse to the aid of special mechanical contrivances and\nmachine tools for the purpose of getting over the difficulty.\nThe annexed illustration has reference to only one class of objects in\nwhich I effected great saving in the production, as well as great\naccuracy in the work.  It refers to a contrivance for producing by the\nturning-lathe the eighty bands of the eccentrics for these twenty\nengines.  Being of a segmental form, but with a projection at each\nextremity, which rendered their production and finish impossible by the\nordinary lathe, I bethought me of applying what is termed the mangle\nmotion to the rim of a face plate of the lay, with so many pins in it\nas to give the required course of segmental motion for the turning tool\nto operate upon, between the projections C C in the illustration.\n\n[image]\n\nI availed myself of the limited to-and-fro horizontal motion of the\nshaft of the mangle motion wheel, as it, at each end of the row of pegs\n--in the face plate (when it passes from the exterior to the interior\nrange of them) in giving the feed motion to the tool in; the slide\nrest, \"turned\" the segmental exterior of the eccentric hoops.\nThis it did perfectly, as the change of position of the small shaft\noccurred at the exact time when the cut was at its termination,--that\nbeing the correct moment to give the tool \"the feed, or advance for the\ntaking of the next cut.  The saving, in respect to time, was 10 to 1 in\ncomparison with the same amount of work done by hand labour; while the\n\"truth\" or correctness of the work done by this handy little\napplication of the turning-lathe was absolutely perfect I have been the\nmore particular in my allusion to this contrivance, as it is applicable\nto any lathe, and can perform work which no lathe without it can\naccomplish.  The unceasing industry of such machines is no small\naddition to their attractions, in respect to the production of\nunquestionably accurate work.\n\n\n1843.

An Improvement in Blowing Fans and their Bearings.\n\nThe principle on which Blowing Fans act, and to which they owe their\nefficiency, consists in their communicating Centrifugal action to the\nair within them.\n\nIn order to obtain the maximum force of blast, with the minimum\nexpenditure of power, it is requisite so to form the outside rim of the\nFan-case as that each compartment formed by the space between the ends\nof the blades of the Fan shall in its course of rotation possess an\nequal facility of exit for the passage of the air it is discharging.\nThus, in a Fan with six blades, the space between the top of the blades\nand the case of the Fan should increase in area in the progressive\nratios of 1-2-3-4-5-6.\n\n[Image]\n\nIf a Fan be constructed on this common-sense principle, we shall secure\nthe maximum of blast from the minimum of driving power.  And not only so;\nbut the humming sound--so disagreeable an accompaniment to the action\nof the Fans (being caused by the successive sudden escape of the air\nfrom each compartment as it comes opposite the space where it can\ndischarge its confined block of air)--will be avoided.  When the outer\ncase of a Fan is formed on the expanding or spiral principle,\nas above described, all these important advantages will attend its use.\nAs the inward current of air rushes in at the circular openings on each\nside of the Fan-case, and would thus oppose each other if there was a\nfree communication between them, this is effectually obviated by\nforming the rotating portion of the fan by a disc of iron plate,\nwhich prevents the opposite in-rushing currents from interfering with\neach other, and at the same time supplies a most substantial means of\nfastening the blades, as they are conveniently riveted to this central\ndisc.  On the whole, this arrangement of machinery supplies a most\neffective \"Noiseless Blowing Fan.\"\n\n\n1845. A direct Action \"Suction\" Fan for the Ventilation of Coal-Mines.\n\nThe frequency of disastrous colliery explosions induced me to give my\nattention to an improved method for ventilating coal mines.\nThe practice then was to employ a furnace, placed at the bottom of the\nupcast shaft of the coal-pit, to produce the necessary ventilation.\nThis practice was highly riskful.  It was dangerous as well as\nineffective.  It was also liable to total destruction when an explosion\noccurred, and the means of ventilation were thus lost when it was most\nurgently required.  The ventilation of mines by a current of air forced\nby a Fan into the workings, had been proposed by a German named George\nAgricola, as far back as 1621.  The arrangement is found figured in his\nwork entitled De Re Metalicat, p. 162.  But in all cases in which this\nsystem of forcing air through the workings and passages of a mine has\nbeen tried, it has invariably been found unsuccessful as a means of\nventilation.\n\nAs all rotative Blowing Fans draw in the air at their centres,\nand expel it at their circumference, it occurred to me that if we were\nto make a communication between the upcast shaft of the mine and the\ncentre or suctional part of the Fan closing the top of the upcast\nshaft, a Fan so arranged would draw out the foul air from the mine,\nand allow the fresh air to descend by the downcast shaft,\nand so traverse the workings.  And as a Suction Fan so placed would be\non the surface of the ground, and quite out of the way of any risk of\ninjury--being open to view and inspection at all times--we should\nthus have an effective and trustworthy means for thorough ventilation.\n\n[Image]\n\nHaving communicated the design for my Direct Action Suction Fan for\ncoal-pit ventilation to the Earl Fitzwilliam, through his agent\nMr. Hartop, in 1850, his lordship was so much pleased with it that I\nreceived an order for one of 14 feet diameter, for the purpose of\nventilating; one of his largest coalpits.  I arranged the steam-engine\nwhich gave motion to the large Fan, so as to be a part of it;\nand by placing the crank of the engine on the end of the Fan-shaft,\nthe engine transferred its power to it in the most simple and direct\nmanner.  The high satisfaction which this Ventilating Fan gave to the\nEarl and to all connected with his coal-mines, led to my receiving\norders for several of them.\n\nI took out no patent for the invention, but sent drawings and\ndescriptions to all whom I knew to be interested in coalmine ventilation.\nI read a paper on the subject, and exhibited the necessary drawings, at\nthe meeting of the British Association at Ipswich in 1851.  These were\nafterwards published in the Mining Journal.  The consequence is that\nmany of my Suction Ventilating Fans are now in successful action at\nhome and abroad.\n\n\n1845. An improvement in the Links of Chain Cables.\n\n\n\n1845. An Improved Method of Welding Iron.\n\nOne of the most important processes in connection with the production\nof the details of machinery, and other purposes in which malleable iron\nis employed, is that termed welding, namely, when more or less complex\nforms are, so to speak, \"built up\" by the union of suitable portions of\nmalleable iron united and incorporated with each other in the process\nof welding.  This consists in heating the parts which we desire to unite\nto a white heat in a smith's forge fire, or in an air furnace, by means\nof which that peculiar adhesive \"wax-like\" capability; of sticking\ntogether is induced,--so that when the several parts are forcibly\npressed into close contact by blows of a hammer, their union is\nrendered perfect.\n\nBut as the intense degree of heat which is requisite to induce this\nadhesive quality is accompanied by the production of a molten oxide of\niron that clings tenaciously to the white-hot surfaces of the iron,\nthe union will not be complete unless every particle of the adhesing\nmolten scoriae is thoroughly discharged and driven out from between the\nsurfaces we desire to unite by welding.  If by any want of due care on\nthe part of the smith, the surfaces be concave or have hollows in them,\nthe scoriae will be sure to lurk in the recesses, and result in a\ndefective welding of a most treacherous nature.  Though the exterior may\ndisplay no evidence of the existence of this fertile cause of failure,\nyet some undue or unexpected strain will rend and disclose the shut-up\nscoriae, and probably end in some fatal break-down.  The annexed figures\nwill perhaps serve to render my remarks on this truly important subject\nmore clear to the reader.\n\n[Image]\n\nFig.1 represents an imperfectly prepared surface of two pieces of\nmalleable iron about to be welded.  The result of their concavity of\nform is that the scoriae are almost certain to be shut up in the hollow\npart,--as the pieces will unite first at the edges and thus include\nthe scoriae, which no amount of subsequent hammering will ever\ndislodge.  They will remain lurking between, as seen in Fig.2.  Happily,\nthe means of obviating all such treacherous risks are as simple as they\nare thoroughly effective.  All that has to be done to render their\noccurrence next to impossible is to give to the surfaces we desire to\nunite by welding a convex form as represented in Fig. 3; the result of\nwhich is that we thus provide an open door for the scoriae to escape\nfrom between the surfaces,--as these unite first in the centre, as\ndue to the convex form, and then the union proceeds outwards, until\nevery particle of scoriae is expelled, and the union is perfectly\ncompleted under the blows of the hammer or other compressing agency.\nFig. 4 represents the final and perfect completion of the welding,\nwhich is effected by this common-sense and simple means,--that is,\nby giving the surfaces a convex form instead of a concave one.\n\nWhen I was called by the Lords of the Admiralty in 1846 to serve on a\nCommittee, the object of which was to investigate the causes of failure\nin the wrought-iron smith work of the navy, many sad instances came\nbefore us of accidents which had been caused by defective welding,\nespecially in the vitally important articles of Anchors and Chain Cables.\nIn the case of the occasional failure of chain cables, the cause was\ngenerally assigned to defective material; but circumstances led me to\nthe conclusion that it was a question of workmanship or maltreatment of\nwhat I knew to be of excellent material.  I therefore instituted a\nseries of experiments which yielded conclusive evidence upon the\nsubject; and which proved that defective welding was the main and chief\ncause of failure.  In order to prove this, several apparently excellent\ncables were, by the aid of \"the proving machine,\" pulled to pieces,\nlink by link, and a careful record was kept of the nature of the\nfracture.  The result was, that out of every 100 links pulled asunder\n80 cases clearly exhibited defective welding; while only 20 were broken\nthrough the clear sound metal.  This yielded a very important lesson to\nthose specially concerned.\n\n\n1845. Introduction of the V Anvil.\n\nIn connection with my Steam Hammer, when employed in forging great\ncylindrical shafts, I introduced what I termed my V anvil.\nIts employment has most importantly contributed to secure perfect\nsoundness in such class of forgings.\n\nIn the old system of forging cylindrical shafts, the bar was placed\nupon a flat-faced anvil.  The effect of each blow of the hammer upon the\nwork was to knock the shaft into an oval form (see Fig. 1); and the\ninevitable result of a succession of such blows was destruction of the\nsoundness of the centre or axis of the shaft.\n\n[image]\n\nIn order to remedy this grave defect, arising from the employment of a\nflat-faced anvil, I introduced my V anvil face (see Fig. 2), the effect\nof which was, that the dispersive action of the blow of the hammer was\nchanged into a converging action, which ensured the perfect soundness\nof the work; while the V or fork-like form of the angle face kept the\nwork steadily under the centre of the hammer, allowing the scale or\nscoriae to fall into the apex or bottom of the V, which thus passed\naway, leaving the faces of the angle quite clear.\n\nThis simple and common-sense improvement was eagerly and generally\nadopted, and has been productive of most satisfactory and important\nresults.\n\n\n1847. A Spherical-seated Direct-weighted Safety Valve.\n\nHaving been on several occasions called to investigate the causes of\nsteam boiler explosions, my attention was naturally directed to the\ncondition of the Safety Valve.  I found the construction of them in many\ncases to be defective in principle as well as in mechanical details;\nresulting chiefly from the employment of a conical form in the valve,\nwhich necessitated the use of a guide spindle to enable it to keep in\ncorrect relative position to its corresponding conical seat, as seen at\nA in Fig. 1.  As this guide spindle is always liable to be clogged with\nthe muddy deposit from the boiling water, which yields a very adhesive\nencrustation, the result is a very riskful tendency to impede the free\naction of the Safety Valve, and thereby prevent its serving its\npurpose.\n\n[image]\n\nWith a view to remove all such causes of uncertainty in the action of\nthis vitally important part of a steam boiler I designed a Safety Valve,\nhaving a spherical valve and corresponding seat, as seen in B C,\nFig. 2.  This form of Safety Valve had the important property of fitting\nto its bearing-seat in all positions, requiring no other guide than its\nown spherical seat to effect that essential purpose.  And as the weight\nrequired to keep the valve closed until the exact desired maximum\npressure of steam has been attained, is directly attached to the under\nside of the valve by the rod, the weight, by being inside the boiler,\nis placed out of reach from any attempt to tamper with it.\n\nThe entire arrangement of this Safety Valve is quite simple.  It is free\nfrom all Lever Joints and other parts which might become clogged;\nand as there is always a slight pendulous motion in the weight by the\naction of the water in the boiler, the spherical surfaces of the valve\nand its seat are thus ever kept in perfect order.  As soon as the\ndesired pressure of steam has been reached, and the gravity of the\nweight overcome, the valve rises from its seat, and gives perfectly\nfree egress to any farther accumulation of steam.  It is really quite a\ntreat, in its way, to observe this truly simple and effective Safety\nValve in action.  After I had contrived and introduced this Safety\nValve, its valuable properties were speedily acknowledged, and.  its\nemployment has now become very general.\n\n\n1847. A Machine for cutting out Cottar Slots and Key-Groove Recesses in\n      Parts of Machinery by a Traversing Drill.\n\nOne of the most tedious and costly processes in the execution of the\ndetail parts of machinery is the cutting out of Cottar Slots in piston\nrods, connecting rods, and key recesses in shafts.  This operation used\nto be performed by drilling a row of holes through the solid body of\nthe object, and then chipping away the intermediate metal between the\nholes, and filing the rude slot, so produced, into its required form.\nThe whole operation, as thus conducted, was one of the most tedious and\nirksome jobs that an engineer workman could be set to, and could only\nbe performed by those possessed of the highest skill.\n\nWhat with broken chisels and files, and the tedious nature of the work,\nit was a most severe task to the very best men, not to speak of the\nheavy cost in wages.\n\nIn order to obviate all these disadvantages, I contrived an arrangement\nof a drilling machine, with a specially formed drill, which at once\nreduced the process to one of the easiest conducted in an engineer's\nworkshop.\n\n[Image]\n\nThe.  \"special\" form of the Drill consisted in the removal of the centre\nportion of its flat cutting face by making it with a notch O.\nThis enabled it to cut sideways, as well as downwards, and thus to cut\na slit or oblong hole.  No labour, as such, was required; but only the\nintelligent superintendence of a lad to place the work in the machine,\nand remove it for the next piece in its turn.  The machine did the\nlabour, and by its self-action did the work in the most perfect manner.\n\nI may further mention that the arrangement of the machine consisted in\ncausing the object to traverse to and fro in a straight line, of any\nrequired length, under the action of the drill.  The traversing action\nwas obtained by the employment of an adjustable crank, which gave the\nrequisite motion to a slide table, on which the work was fastened.\nThe \"feed\" downwards of the drill was effected by the crank at the\nmoment of its reversing the slide, as the drill reached the end of the\ntraverse; and, as there is a slight pause of the traverse at each end\nof it, the \"feed\" for the next cutting taking place at that time,\nthe drill has the opportunity given to perfect its cut ere it commences\nthe next cutting traverse in succession.  This action continues in\nregular course until the drill makes its way right through the piece of\nwork under its action; or can be arrested at any required depth\naccording to the requirements of the work.  Soap and water as a\nlubricator continues to drop into the recess of the slot, and is always\nin its right place to assist the cutting of the drill.\n\nAs before said, the entire function of this most effective machine tool\nis self-acting.  It only required an intelligent lad or labourer to\nattend to it; and, as there was ample time to spare, the\nsuperintendence of two of these machines was quite within his ability.\nThe rates of the productive powers of this machine, as compared with\nthe former employment of hand labour, was at least ten to one;\nto say nothing of the superior quality of the work executed.\n\nSuch were the manifold advantages of this machine, that its merits soon\nbecame known and appreciated; and although I had taken out no patent\nfor it, we always had an abundance of orders, as it was its own best\nadvertisement.\n\n\n1848. A Steam Hammer Form of Steam-Engine.\n\n[Image]\n\nThis engine is of great simplicity and get-at-ability of parts.\nIt is specially adapted for screw-propelled steamships, and many other\npurposes.  It is now in very general use.  The outline is given above.\n\n\n1848. Application of Hydraulic Power to the Punching of Large Holes in\n      Iron Bars, and Plates of Great Thickness.\n\nDr. Faraday having applied to me to furnish him, for one of his\nlectures at the Royal Institution, with some striking example of the\nPower of Machinery in overcoming the resistance to penetration in the\ncase of some such material as cold malleable iron, it occurred to me to\napply the tranquil but vast power of a hydraulic press to punch out a\nlarge hole in a thick cake of malleable iron.  Knowing that my excellent\nfriend John Rick had in his works at Bolton one of the most powerful\nhydraulic presses then existing, contrived and constructed by his\ningenious father, the late Benjamin Hick, I proceeded to Bolton, and\nexplained Dr. Faraday's requirement, when, with his usual liberal zeal,\nMr. Hick at once placed the use of his great hydraulic press at my\nservice.\n\nHaving had a suitable cake of steam-hammered malleable iron given to me\nfor the purpose in question, by my valued friend Thomas Lever Rushton\nof the Bolton Ironworks, we soon had the cake of iron placed in the\ngreat press.  It was 5 inches thick,18 inches long, and 15 inches wide.\nPlacing a cylindrical coupling box of cast-iron on the table of the\npress, and then placing the thick cake of iron on it, and a short\ncylindrical mass of iron (somewhat of the size and form of a Stilton\nCheese) on the iron cake, the coupling box acting as the Bolster of the\nextemporised punching machine,--the press was then set to work.\nWe soon saw the Stilton Cheese-like punch begin to sink slowly and\nquietly through the 5-inch thick cake of iron, as if it had been stiff\nclay.  The only sound heard was when the punched-out mass dropped into\nthe recess of the coupling below.  Such a demonstration of tranquil but\nalmost resistless power of a hydraulic press had never, so far as we\nwere aware, been seen before.  The punched of iron, together with the\npunched-out disc, were then packed off to Faraday; and great was his\ndelight in having his request so promptly complied with.  Great also was\nthe wonder of his audience when the punched plate was placed upon the\nlecture table.  This feat of Benjamin Hick's great hydraulic press set\nme a-thinking.  I conceived the idea that the application of hydraulic\npress power might serve many similar purposes in dealing with ultra\nthick plates or bar iron,--such as the punching out of holes,\nand cutting thick bars and plates into definite shapes, as might be\nrequired.  I suggested the subject to my friend Charles Fox, head of the\nfirm of Fox, Henderson, and Co. He had taken a large contract for a\nchain bridge, the links of which were to be of thick flat iron bars,\nwith the ends broadened out for the link-pins to pass through.\nHe had described to me the trouble and cost they had occasioned him in\ndrilling the holes, and in cropping the rude-shaped ends of the bars\ninto the required form.  I advised him to try the use of the hydraulic\npress as a punching-machine, and also as a cutting-machine to dress the\nends of the great links.  He did so in due time, and found the\nsuggestion of great service and value to him in this, and in other\ncases of a similar kind.  The saving of cost was very great,\nand the work was much more perfect than under the former system.\n\n\n1848. An Alternately-pegged \"Shive\" or Pulley for Rope Band Power\n      Transmission.\n\n\n1848. A Turn-table \"Trunnion Vision\" Reflecting Telescope.\n\nThis is so arranged that the observer can direct the Telescope and view\nan object in any part of the heavens without moving from his seat,\nwhich is attached to the turn-table.  For explanations, see text, p. 337.\n\n\n\n1850. A Double or Ambidexter Self-acting Turning-Lathe,\n      with \"Dead Gutters,\" specially adapted for turning Bolts and\n      suchlike detail Parts of Machinery.\n\n[Image]\n\n[Image]\n\n      This is a very valuable tool.  It requires only one attendant.\nIt is especially useful as regards efficiency and economy.  It will be\nsufficiently understood by mechanical engineers from the annexed\ndrawings.\n\n\n1852. A Solid-bar \"Link-Valve Motion,\" especially valuable for the\n      larger class of Marine Steam-Engines.\n\n\n1854. Steam Puddling Patent.\n\nThis was the \"pioneer\" of the Bessemer process.  See Bessemer\ncorrespondence, p. 354\n\n\n1854. A Reversible Rolling Mill without Fly-wheel.\n\nThis Rolling Mill consists of two combined steam-engines, acting on\ncranks at right angles, the reversing of the rolls being effected by\nthe link motion.  The requisite rolling power is obtained by suitable\nwheel and pinion gear, so as to be entirely independent of the momentum\nof a fly-wheel, which is entirely dispensed with.\n\nI did not patent the invention.  As usual in such cases, I made no\nsecret of it, but sent sketches explanatory of the arrangement to many\nprofessional friends interested in mechanical improvements.\nIt was adopted by many, especially for rolling long and heavy bars and\nplates.  It enabled the workmen to \"see-saw\" these ponderous objects,\nand pass them to and fro through the rolls with the utmost case,--\nto the great saving of heat, time, and labour.  The invention was first\nbrought into use by Mr. Ramsbotham at the Crewe works of the London and\nNorth-Western Railway.  On the 4th December 1866 I received the\nfollowing letter from him:\n\n\"DEAR SIR--I must crave your forgiveness for my great delay in\nacknowledging the receipt of your kind letter of the 29th August,\nin which you refer to the successful carrying out at these works of\nyour idea of a 'Reversible Rolling Mill without a Fly-wheel.'\nIt has long been to me a matter of astonishment that your idea has not\nbeen reduced to practice years ago, particularly when it is considered\nhow well the arrangement is adapted to the rolling of Armour Plates, or\nother work requiring a sustained effort, whilst it is at the same time\nmore effective than the ordinary mill arrangement for very light work.\nSo much is this latter true, that the men who are left to their own\nchoice in the matter, will reverse the mill rather than pass a light\nsheet of 8 or 10 lbs.  weight over the upper roll.  This country is much\nindebted to you for so valuable a suggestion; and now that it has been\nbrought to a successful issue, I have no doubt but it will be widely\nacted upon.  I need not add that it will afford me much pleasure to show\nyou the mill, and also what we are doing generally, if you should at\nany time visit Crewe.--\nBelieve me very faithfully yours, \" J. RAMSBOTHAM.\"\n\nI also communicated the invention to Mr. Thomas Gillott of the Farnley\nIronworks, Yorkshire, and received from him the following letter, dated\nthe 2d January 1877:\n\n\" DEAR SIR--I was much gratified to see by your letter in Engineering\n the interest you have shown with respect to the large Reversing Plate\nMill erected by me at these works, and drawn on the plan suggested by\nyou.  Allow me to thank you for the complimentary manner in which you\nhave mentioned my work.  Since the notice appeared, we have done a deal\nof heavy work in this mill; and a plate large enough to shear 11' 0\"\nand 10' 2\" and 1/2\" thick has been rolled in five minutes.  The slab\nwent through the roll 17 times before being rolled to the width and\nturned round, and 18 times after turning and of the full width;\nmaking a total of 35 passes--the turning occupying 20 seconds.\nWhen it is remembered how rapidly a thin plate cools, this performance\nwill sufficiently indicate the severe work this mill is capable of\ndoing; notwithstanding the many predictions that such large plates\ncould not be rolled without a fly-wheel.  As to repairs, none have been\nrequired; so I cannot compare this with the Clutch systems.  In respect\nof steam used, the direct acting engines compare favourably with an\nexpansion beam condensing engine doing similar but lighter work.\nShould it ever be your wish to see this mill at work, I should be much\npleased to have the opportunity of showing it to you.--\nI am, dear sir, your obedient servant,\n\n\"THOMAS GILLOTT.\"\n\n\n1854. Drilling Tunnels through Hard Rock.\n\nBesides these contrivances and methods of accomplishing mechanical\nobjects, I have on several occasions read papers, prepared drawings,\nand given suggestions, out of which have come so-called \"inventions\"\nmade by others.  For instance, at the meeting of the British Association\nin Liverpool in 1854, I read a paper and exhibited drawings before the\nMechanical Science Section, on my method of drilling tunnels through\nhard rock.  The paper and drawings excited considerable interest among\nthe railway engineers who were present.  I afterwards met Mr. George\nNewmann, C.E., who consulted me on the same subject.  Several years\nafter (21st April 1863) I received the following letter from him:\n\n\"DEAR Sir--Some few years ago, I had the pleasure of spending an\nevening in your company at my relative's (Mr. G. Withington) house at\nPendleton.  As I was then Engineer to the Victor Emmanuel Railway, and\nhad made a survey of the Mout Cenis for the purpose of the Tunnel,\nI consulted you as to the application of the machinery for that work.\nYou suggested the driving of drills in a manner similar to a piston-rod,\nwith other details.  On my return to Savoy, I communicated these ideas\nto Mr. Bartlett, the contractor's agent, and I recommended him to get a\nsmall trial machine made.  This he had done in a few months, and then he\nclaimed the whole idea as his own.  The system has since been carried\nout (see Times, 4th April 1863) by compressed air instead of steam.\nI call your attention to this, as you may contradict, if you think\nproper, the assertion in the article above mentioned, that the idea\noriginated with Bartlett.\"\n\nI did not, however, contradict the assertion.  I am glad that my\ndescription and drawings proved in any way useful towards the\ncompletion of that magnificent work, the seven-mile tunnel under\nMont Cenis.\n\n1862.  Chilled Cast-iron Shot.\n\nIn like manner, I proposed the use of Chilled Cast-Iron Shot at a\nmeeting of the Mechanical Science Section of the British Association,\nheld at Cambridge in October 1862.  Up to that time hardened steel shot\nhad been used to penetrate thick iron plates, but the cost was\nexcessive, about #30 a ton.  I proposed that Chilled Cast-Iron should be\nsubstituted; it was more simple and inexpensive.  Considerable\ndiscussion took place on the subject; and Sir William Fairbairn,\nwho was President of the Section, said that \"he would have experiments\nmade, and he hoped that before the next meeting of the Association, the\nmatter would be proved experimentally.  A brief report of the discussion\nis given in the Times of the 7th October, and in the Athenaeum of the\n18th October, 1862.  Before, however, the matter could be put to the\ntest of experiment, Major Palliser had taken out his Patent for the\ninvention of Chilled Cast-Iron Shot, in May 1863, for which he was\nafterwards handsomely rewarded.\n\nI do not wish to \"grasp\" at any man's inventions, but it is right to\nclaim my own, and to state the facts.  The discussion above mentioned\ntook place upon a paper read by J. Aston, Esq., Q.C., who thus refers\nto the subject in his letter to me, dated the 7th January 1867:\n\n\"I perfectly remember the discussion which took place at the meeting of\nthe British Association at Cambridge in 1862, upon the material proper\nto be used as projectiles.  The discussion arose after a paper had been\nread by me in the Mechanical Section upon 'Rifled guns and projectiles\nadapted for attacking armour plates.' The paper was, I think, printed\nby the Association in their Report for 1862.  You spoke, I believe,\nat some length on the occasion; and I recollect that you surprised and\nmuch interested all who were present, by strenuously urging the use of\nChilled Cast-iron for shot and shell, intended for penetrating armour\nplates.\n\n\"Having embraced all opportunities, and I had many at that time,\nof ascertaining all that was done in the way of improving rifled\nprojectiles, I entertained a very strong opinion that experiments had\nshown that ordinary cast-iron was, as compared with steel, of very\nlittle value for shot and shell to be used against iron plates.\nFor that reason, I remember I took an opportunity, after the\ntermination of the discussion, in which you held your own against all\ncomers in favour of chilled cast-iron, of questioning you closely on\nthe subject, and you gave me, I admitted, good reason for the opinion\nyou expressed.  You also urged me to cause a trial to be made of chilled\ncast-iron for shell, such as I had shown to the section, and which (in\nhardened steel shot) had been fired by Mr. Whitworth through thick iron\nplates.  This I had not an opportunity of doing.  Term began soon after,\nand Temple occupations then took up all my time.  \"There can be no doubt\nwhatever that any one who may claim to have been before you in teaching\nthe public the use of Chilled Cast Iron for projectiles intended to\npenetrate iron plates, must give proof of having so done prior to your\nvigorous advocacy of that material at the Cambridge Meeting in 1862.--\nYours very sincerely, \"J.Aston.\"\n\nIn another letter Mr. Aston says--\"It is quite right of you to assert\nyour claim to that which in fact belongs to you.\"  I did not, however,\nassert my claim; and, with these observations and extracts, I leave the\nmatter, stating again the fact that my public communication of the\ninvention was made in October 1862; and that the patent for the\ninvention was taken out by Major Palliser in May 1863.\n\n\nMr Nasmyth's final comments on his inventions and contrivances.\n\nI have only mentioned the more prominent of my inventions and\ncontrivances.  Had I described them fully I should have required another\nvolume.  I have the satisfaction to know that many of them have greatly\nadvanced the progress of the mechanical arts, though they may not be\nacknowledged as mine.  I patented very few of my inventions.  The others\nI sowed broadcast over the world of practical mechanics.  My reward is\nin the knowledge that these \"children of my brain\" are doing, and will\ncontinue to do, good service in time present and in time to come.\n\nIn mechanical structures and contrivances, I have always endeavoured to\nattain the desired purpose by the employment of the Fewest Parts,\ncasting aside every detail not absolutely necessary, and guarding\ncarefully against the intrusion of mere traditional forms and\narrangements.  The latter are apt to insinuate themselves,\nand to interfere with that simplicity and directness of action\nwhich is in all cases so desirable a quality in mechanical structures.\nPLAIN COMMON SENSE should be apparent in the general design,\nas in the form and arrangement of the details; and a general character\nof severe utility pervade the whole, accompanied with as much attention\nto gracefulness of form as is consistent with the nature and purpose of\nthe structure.\n\n\nTHE SUN-RAY ORIGIN OF THE PYRAMIDS AND CUNEIFORM  CHARACTER.\n\nBefore I take my leave of the public, I wish to put on record my\nspeculations as to the origin of two subjects of remote antiquity, viz.\nthe Sun-ray origin of the Pyramids, and the origin of the Arrow-head\nor Cuneiform Character.\n\nFirst, with respect to the Sun-ray origin of the Egyptian Pyramids.\n\nIn pursuing a very favourite subject of inquiry, namely the origin of\nforms, no portion of it appears to me to be invested with so deep an\ninterest as that of the Worship of the Sun, one of the most primitive\nand sacred foundations of adorative religion,--affecting as it has\ndone, architectural structures and numerous habits and customs which\nhave come clown to us from remote antiquity, and which owe their origin\nto its influence.\n\nOn many occasions, while beholding the sublime effects of the Sun's\nRays streaming down on the earth through openings in the clouds near\nthe horizon, I have been forcibly impressed with the analogy they\nappear to suggest as to the form of the Pyramid, while the single\nvertical ray suggests that of the Obelisk.\n\nIn following up this subject, I was fortunate enough to find what\nappears to me a strong confirmation of my views, namely, that the\nPyramid, as such, was a sacred form.  I met with many examples of this\nin the Egyptian Collection at the Louvre at Paris; especially in small\npyramids, which were probably the objects of household worship.\nIn one case I found a small pyramid, on the upper part of which\nappeared the disc of the Sun, with pyramidal rays descending from it on\nto figures in the Egyptian attitude of adoration.  This consists in the\nhands held up before the eyes--an attitude expressive of the brightness\nof the object adored.  It is associated with the brightness of the Sun,\nand it still survives in the Salaam, which expresses profound reverence\nand respect among Eastern nations.  It also survives in the disc of the\nSun, which has for ages been placed like a halo behind the heads of\nsacred and exalted personages, as may be seen in Eastern and early\npaintings, as well as in church windows at the present day.\n\nThis is also intimately connected with lighted lamps and candles, which\nlatter may often be met with in Continental churches, as well as in\nEnglish Ritualist Churches at the present day.  In Romish Continental\nchurches they are stuck on to pyramidal stands, and placed before\npictures and images of sacred personages.  All such lighted lamps or\ncandles are survivals of that most ancient form of worship,--\nthat of THE SUN!\n\nThe accompanying illustrations will serve in some degree to confirm the\ncorrectness of my views as to this very.  interesting subject.\n\n[Image]  Fig. 1 is from a \"rubbing\" of one of the many small or\n         \"Household\" pyramids in the Louvre Collection at Paris;\n\n[Image] while Fig. 2 is an attempt to illustrate in a graphic manner\n        the derivation of the form of the Pyramid and Obelisk from the\n        Sun's Rays.\n\nIn connection with the worship of the Sun and other heavenly bodies, as\npractised in ancient times by Eastern nations, it may be mentioned that\ntheir want of knowledge of the vast distances that separate them from\nthe earth led them to the belief that these bodies were so near as to\nexert a direct influence upon man and his affairs.  Hence the origin of\nAstrology, with all its accompanying mystifications; this was practised\nunder the impression that the Sun, Moon, and planets were near to the\nearth.  The summits of mountains and \"High Places\" thus became \"sacred,\"\nand were for this reason resorted to for the performance of the most\nimportant religious ceremonies.\n\nAs the \"High Places\" could not be transported to the Temples,\nthe cone-bearing trees, which were naturally associated with these\nelevated places, in a manner partook of their sacred character, and the\nfruit of the trees became in a like manner sacred.  Hence the Fir Cone\nbecame a portable emblem of their sacredness; and, accordingly in the\nAssyrian Worship, so clearly represented to us in the Assyrian\nSculptures in our Museums, we find the Fir Cone being presented by the\npriests towards the head of their kings as a high function of\nBeatification.  So sacred was the Fir Cone, as the fruit of the sacred\ntree, that the priest who presents it has a reticule-shaped bag in\nwhich, no doubt, the sacred emblem was reverently deposited when not in\nuse for the performance of these high religious ceremonies.\n\nThe same emblem \"survived\" in the Greek worship.  I annex a tracing\nfrom a wood engraving in Fellows's Researches in Asia Minor, 1852\n(p. 175), showing the Fir Cone as the finial to the staff of office of\nthe Wine-god Bacchus.\n\n[Image]\n\nTo this day it is employed to stir the juice of the grape previous to\nfermentation, and so sanctifying it by contact with the fruit of the\nSacred Tree.  This is still practised by the Greeks in Asia Minor and\nin Greece, though introduced in times of remote antiquity.\nThe Fir Cone communicates to most of the Greek wines that peculiar\nturpentine or resinous flavour which is found in them.  Although the\nsanctification motive has departed, the resinous flavour is all that\nsurvives of a once most sacred ceremony, as having so close a relation\nto the worship of the Sun and the heavenly bodies.\n\nIn like manner, it appears to me highly probable that \"The Christmas Tree\"\nwith its lighted tapers, which is introduced at that sacred season for\nthe entertainment of our young people, is \"a survival\" of the worship\nof the sacred tree and of the Sun.  The toys which are hung on the twigs\nof the tree may also be \"survivals\" of the offerings which were usually\nmade to the Sun and the heavenly bodies.  If I am correct in my\nconjecture on this subject, it throws a very interesting light on\nwhat is considered as a mere agent for the amusement of children.\n\n\n\nNext, with respect to the Cuneiform Character.  When I first went to\nreside in London, in 1829, I often visited the British Museum.\nIt was the most instructive and interesting of all the public\ninstitutions which I had yet seen.  I eagerly seized every opportunity\nI could spare to spend as many hours as possible in wandering through\nits extensive galleries, especially those which contained the Assyrian,\nEgyptian, and Greek antiquities.  By careful and repeated examination\nof the objects arranged in them, I acquired many ideas that afforded me\nsubjects for thought and reflection.\n\nAmongst these objects, I was specially impressed and interested with\nthe so-called \"Arrow-head\" or \"Cuneiform Inscriptions\" in the Assyrian\nDepartment.  These remarkable inscriptions were on large tablets of\nburnt clay.  They formed the chief portion of the then comparatively\nlimited collection of Assyrian antiquities in the British Museum.\n\n[Image] Fig 1.\n\nI was particularly impressed with the precision and simple beauty of\nthese cuneiform inscriptions,--especially with the strikingly\ndistinctive nature of what I may term the fundamental or elementary\nwedge-like form, of which the vast variety of letters or words of these\ninscriptions were composed.  The triangular or three-sided indentation\nwill be observed in the above engraving (Fig. 1).  This elementary\nform, placed in various positions with respect to each other, appeared\nto be capable of yielding an infinite variety of letters and words,\nas seen in Fig. 2.\n\n[Image] Fig 2.\n\nI may here mention that I entered upon this interesting subject with no\npretensions as a linguist, nor with any idea of investigating the\nmeaning of these remarkable inscriptions; but only as a Mechanic, to\nascertain the manner in which the striking characters were produced, so\nas to convey words and ideas through their variety of combinations.\nI soon perceived that the simple but distinctive characters shown in\nthe above representations were essentially connected with the\nemployment of plastic clay; this being the material most suitable for\ntheir impression, by means of a three-sided instrument or stylus.\nThe angular extremity of this instrument, when depressed into the\nsurface of a tablet of plastic clay in different positions and\ndirections, would leave these cuneiform impressions in all their\nbeautifully distinct and characteristic forms.  And thus, after the\ntablets had been subjected to fire and made into hard brick,\nthe impressions have come down to us, after the lapse of thousands of\nyears, as fresh and distinct as if they had been produced but\nyesterday!\n\nI was so fortunate as to have my conjectures confirmed with respect to\nthe exact form of the instrument by which these remarkable characters\nare produced, observing, in what appeared to be a hastily-formed\ninscription on the edge of a large brick, that the inscriber had\napparently used rather more pressure on his stylus than was requisite.\nIn consequence of which, the end of it had been so deeply depressed\ninto the soft clay as to leave an exact counterpart of its size and\nform.  I secured a cast of this over-deep impression of the stylus,\nfrom which Fig. 3 is taken, after a photograph.\n\n[Image]  Fig 3.\n\nIn order further to illustrate the simple mode of producing\ninscriptions on tablets of clay, I give in Fig. 4 a tablet inscription\nproduced by means of the stylus which is seen laid over the tablet.\n\n[Image]  Fig 4.\n\nThe next illustration (Fig.5) is intended to convey an idea of the\nmanner in which the stylus was held and applied to the surface of the\nclay when a cuneiform inscription was being produced.  The upper, flat,\nor third side of the stylus enabled the inscriber to keep it in correct\nrelative position in respect to the tablet, yielding at the same time a\nconvenient flat surface upon which to rest the end of his finger when\nindenting the angular end into the clay.\n\n[Image]  Fig 5.\n\nRefer back to Fig. 2, and it will be found that any variety in the\nsize of the cuneiform inscriptions may be produced by the same stylus,\nby simply depressing the angular end of it to a greater or less depth\ninto the surface of the clay.  In many of the most elaborate\ninscriptions, a certain lob-sidedness of the cuneiform character may be\nobserved.  This is due to the inscriber having held his stylus somewhat\naskew, as we do a pen in ordinary writing.  Referring to my remark that\nthe distinctive shape of the cuneiform character was essentially due to\nthe use of plastic clay as the most suitable material for its\nproduction, I think it highly probable that the origin of these\ninscriptions took its rise not only from the facility with which the\ncharacters could be indented on the material, but from the abundance of\nplastic mud which forms the natural soil of the lands adjoining the\ngreat Assyrian rivers.  This when made into bricks, became the chief\nbuilding material of the energetic people of Babylon and the other\ngreat cities of the Tigris and Euphrates valleys.  The laborious work\nof brickmaking was generally assigned to captives as taskwork, and it\nappears to me highly probable that \"the tale\" of the brickmaker or his\ntaskmaster might be most readily marked by simply indenting the side of\nthe soft tale brick with the corner angle of a dry one; and that thus\nthe strikingly peculiar character of the cuneiform character was\nproduced (see Fig. 6).\n\n[Image] Fig 6.\n\nIn course of time the elementary form was expanded into this most\nbeautifully simple mode of communicating ideas through the agency of\nconventional signs or letters; being also especially suited for making\nhistorical or other records on tablets of moist clay, which, when\n\"fired\", became absolutely indestructible, so far as time is concerned.\n\nThis is abundantly proved by those marvellously perfect burnt clay\ntablets, covered with exquisitely minute and perfect inscriptions,\nwhich, after having remained hid in mounds of rubbish for thousands of\nyears, among the ruins of the Assyrian cities, are brought to light as\nfresh and perfect as on the day on which they were executed.\nThese tablets now excite the wonder and admiration of all who are able\nto appreciate the beauty of the inscriptions, as well as of those who\nare speculatively curious as to the origin of written language.\nThis attempt to explain the probable origin of the cuneiform character\nmay to some appear fanciful.  But whether or not, it is certain that\nthis simple and impressive character can be readily produced by the\nprimitive means which I have ventured to suggest.  I give a cuneiform\ninscription (Fig. 7), which I have produced by simply employing the\ncorner angle of an ordinary brick as the stylus for indenting the\ninscription on the tablet of soft clay.  This might have been extended\nto any length, in longer as well as minuter impressions.\n\n[Image]  Fig 7.\n\nAs soon as the capability of the cuneiform impression was adopted as\nthe Assyrian character, it was in due time employed for inscriptions on\nstone or other materials, such as marble or alabaster.  The chisel was\nthen substituted for the stylus; but the characters remained in a great\nmeasure the same.  In some cases a slight modification was observable,\nbeing naturally due to the change of material and the method of carving\nit; but in most respects the departure from the clay prototype is very\nslight, and the original is adhered to with remarkable integrity.\n\nWhen examining some early Greek inscriptions in marble, in the British\nMuseum, in the year 1837, I was much interested to observe the\nappearance of a cuneiform element in the limbs of several Greek\nletters, especially in the terminals, as illustrated in Fig. 8,\neach limb of the letter being in itself a perfect cuneiform;\nand as such the terminal of each limb is at right angles to the axis,\nand not as now (in our modern capital letters) parallel to the line of\ninscription.\n\n[Image]  Fig 8.\n\nThis apparent presence of the cuneiform element in these early Greek\ninscriptions suggests some very interesting historic causes which led\nto their introduction, and so passed from the Greek into the Roman,\nand eventually into the capital letters of our own alphabet.  To give\none instance,--though many might be cited,--take the capital letter T,\nand it will be found that it went from the Cuneiform into the Greek,\nthen into the Roman, and lastly into our own letter, thus presenting a\nremarkable instance of the survival of a form from remote antiquity\ndown to the present day.\n\n[Image]  Fig 9.\n\nThe letters A K H I K M N Y X have the distinct remains of their\nBabylonian origin in the top and bottom stroke, which is nothing more\nnor less than a corruption of the original or primitive arrow-headed\nimpression of the stylus in the moist clay, begun thousands of years\nago.\n\nIn a lecture which I gave at the Royal Institution in London, in 1839,\nand in another at the British Association at Cheltenham, in 1856,\nI referred to this presence of the cuneiform element in the Greek\nletters, illustrating the subject by actual casts from the inscriptions\nthemselves.  At Cheltenham the question gave rise to a most animated\nand interesting discussion, in which Dr. Whewell and Sir Thomas\nPhillips (the great antiquarian) took a prominent part.  I understood\nthat Sir Thomas Phillips assigned that the intermixture of cuneiform\nwith the Greek alphabet proceeded from the Samaritans, who were\noriginally an Assyrian colony.  I find that many Greek inscriptions\nexhibit the cuneiform element in nearly all the letters composing them.\nThis is a subject well worthy of the attention of our antiquarian Greek\nscholars, as pointing to an intimate intercourse with the Assyrians at\nsome remote age.  The distinctive character of the cuneiform in the\nGreek inscriptional letters could not have arisen from chance.\nSome intercommunication with the Assyrians must have taken place.\n\nThis subject is all the more interesting, as the cuneiform element\nappears to have passed from the Greek inscriptional letters into those\nof the Romans, and from thence into our own capital letters.\nThis affords a very remarkable instance of the \"survival\" of a form,\nwhich, however naturally due to the plastic material in connection with\nwhich it originated, nevertheless led to its use for ages after the\ncircumstances which led to its adoption had passed away.  This tendency\nin mankind to cling to shapes and forms through mere traditional\ninfluences is widely observable, especially in connection with\narchitectural forms, arrangements, and decorative details.  It offers a\nsubject of great interest to those who have a natural aptitude to\ninvestigate what I may term the etymology of form, a subject of the\nmost attractive nature, especially to those who enjoy thinking and\nreflecting upon what they have specially observed.\n\n[Image]  Assyrian roller-seal.\n\nBefore concluding this subject I may mention that the Assyrians\nemployed a cylindrical roller-seal in order to produce impressions in a\nwholesale way.  This is exemplified in the above engraving.\nThe mechanical principles inherent in this beautifully simple form of\nroller-seal, indicate a high order of ingenuity, well worthy of the\noriginators of the arrow-headed character.  In fact it is the prototype\nnot only of the modern system of calico-printing but of the Waiter\nPrinting Press, by which the Times and many other newspapers are now\nprinted--a remarkable instance of the survival or restoration of a\nvery old method of impression.\n\n[Image]  His Autograph and Thumb Mark.",
