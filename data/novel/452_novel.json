SULLIVAN\n\nWITH AN INTRODUCTION BY AUGUSTINE\nBIRRELL, Q.C., M.P.\n\nLondon\nMACMILLAN AND CO., LIMITED\nNEW YORK: THE MACMILLAN COMPANY\n1900\n\n_All rights reserved_\n\n_First published in_ \"_Macmillan's Illustrated Standard Novel_,\" 1896\n_Reprinted_ 1900\n\n{picture:George Borrow: page0.jpg}\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe author of _Lavengro_, _the Scholar_, _the Gypsy_, _and the Priest_\nhas after his fitful hour come into his own, and there abides securely.\nBorrow's books,--carelessly written, impatient, petulant, in parts\nrepellant,--have been found so full of the elixir of life, of the charm\nof existence, of the glory of motion, so instinct with character, and\nmood, and wayward fancy, that their very names are sounds of enchantment,\nwhilst the fleeting scenes they depict and the deeds they describe have\nbecome the properties and the pastimes for all the years that are still\nto be of a considerable fraction of the English-speaking race.\n\nAnd yet I suppose it would be considered ridiculous in these fine days to\ncall Borrow a great artist.  His fascination, his hold upon his reader,\nis not the fascination or the hold of the lords of human smiles and\ntears.  They enthrall us; Borrow only bewitches.  Isopel Berners, hastily\nlimned though she be, need fear comparison with no damsel that ever lent\nsweetness to the stage, relish to rhyme, or life to novel.  She can hold\nup her head and take her own part amidst all the Rosalinds, Beatrices,\nand Lucys that genius has created and memory can muster.  But how she\ncame into existence puzzles us not a little.  Was she summoned out of\nnothingness by the creative fancy of Lavengro, or did he really first set\neyes upon her in the dingle whither she came with the Flaming Tinman,\nwhose look Lavengro did not like at all?  Reality and romance, though\nBorrow made them wear double harness, are not meant to be driven\ntogether.  It is hard to weep aright over Isopel Berners.  The reader is\ntortured by a sense of duty towards her.  This distraction prevents our\ngiving ourselves away to Borrow.  Perhaps after all he did meet the tall\ngirl in the dingle, in which case he was a fool for all his pains, losing\na gift the gods could not restore.\n\nQuite apart from this particular doubt, the reader of Borrow feels that\ngood luck, happy chance, plays a larger part in the charm of the\ncomposition than is quite befitting were Borrow to be reckoned an artist.\nBut nobody surely will quarrel with this ingredient.  It can turn no\nstomach.  Happy are the lucky writers!  Write as they will, they are\nalmost certain to please.  There is such a thing as 'sweet\nunreasonableness.'\n\nBut no sooner is this said than the necessity for instant and substantial\nqualification becomes urgent, for though Borrow's personal vanity would\nhave been wounded had he been ranked with the literary gentlemen who do\nbusiness in words, his anger would have been justly aroused had he been\ntold he did not know how to write.  He did know how to write, and he\nacquired the art in the usual way, by taking pains.  He might with\nadvantage have taken more pains, and then he would have done better; but\ntake pains he did.  In all his books he aims at producing a certain\nimpression on the minds of his readers, and in order to produce that\nimpression he was content to make sacrifices; hence his whimsicality, his\nout-of-the-wayness, at once his charm and his snare, never grows into\nwantonness and seldom into gross improbability.  He studied effects, as\nhis frequent and impressive liturgical repetitions pleasingly\ndemonstrate.  He had theories about most things, and may, for all I know,\nhave had a theory of cadences.  For words he had no great feeling except\nas a philologist, and is capable of strange abominations.  'Individual'\npursues one through all his pages, where too are 'equine species,' 'finny\ntribe'; but finding them where we do even these vile phrases, and others\nnearly as bad, have a certain humour.\n\nThis chance remark brings me to the real point.  Borrow's charm is that\nhe has behind his books a character of his own, which belongs to his\nbooks as much as to himself; something which bears you up and along as\ndoes the mystery of the salt sea the swimmer.  And this something lives\nand stirs in almost every page of Borrow, whose restless, puzzling,\nteasing personality pervades and animates the whole.\n\nHe is the true adventurer who leads his life, not on the Stock Exchange\namidst the bulls and bears, or in the House of Commons waiting to clutch\nthe golden keys, or in South Africa with the pioneers and promoters, but\nwith himself and his own vagrant moods and fancies.  There was no need\nfor Borrow to travel far afield in search of adventures.  Mumpers' Dell\nwas for him as good an environment as Mexico; a village in Spain or\nPortugal served his turn as well as both the Indies; he was as likely to\nmeet adventures in Pall Mall as in the far Soudan.  Strange things happen\nto him wherever he goes; odd figures step from out the hedgerow and\nengage him in wild converse; beggar-women read _Moll Flanders_ on London\nBridge; Armenian merchants cuff deaf and dumb clerks in London counting-\nhouses; prize-fighters, dog-fanciers, Methodist preachers, Romany ryes\nand their rawnees move on and off.  Why should not strange things happen\nto Lavengro?  Why should not strange folk suddenly make their appearance\nbefore him and as suddenly take their departure?  Is he not strange\nhimself?  Did he not puzzle Mr. Petulengro, excite the admiration of Mrs.\nPetulengro, the murderous hate of Mrs. Herne, and drive Isopel Berners\nhalf distracted?\n\nNobody has, so far, attempted to write the life of George Borrow.  Nor\ncan we wonder.  How could any one dare to follow in the phosphorescent\ntrack of _Lavengro_ and _The Romany Rye_, or add a line or a hue to the\nportraits there contained of Borrow's father and mother--the gallant\nsoldier who had no chance, and whose most famous engagement took place,\nnot in Flanders, or in Egypt, or on the banks of the Indus or Oxus, but\nin Hyde Park, his foe being Big Ben Brain; and the dame of the oval face,\nolive complexion, and Grecian forehead, sitting in the dusky parlour in\nthe solitary house at the end of the retired court shaded by lofty\npoplars?  I pity 'the individual' whose task it should be to travel along\nthe enchanted wake either of Lavengro in England or Don Jorge in Spain.\nPoor would be his part; no better than that of Arthur in 'The Bothie':--\n\n   And it was told, the Piper narrating and Arthur correcting,\n   Colouring he, dilating, magniloquent, glorying in picture,\n   He to a matter-of-fact still softening, paring, abating,\n   He to the great might-have-been upsoaring, sublime and ideal,\n   He to the merest it-was restricting, diminishing, dwarfing,\n   River to streamlet reducing, and fall to slope subduing:\n   So it was told, the Piper narrating, corrected of Arthur.\n\nGeorge Borrow, like many another great man, was born in Norfolk, at East\nDereham, in 1803, and at an early age began those rambles he has made\nfamous, being carried about by his father, Captain Borrow, who was\nchiefly employed as a recruiting officer.  The reader of _Lavengro_ may\nsafely be left to make out his own itinerary.  Whilst in Edinburgh Borrow\nattended the High School, and acquired the Scottish accent.  It is not\ntoo much to say that he has managed to make even Edinburgh more romantic\nsimply by abiding there for a season.  From Scotland he went to Ireland,\nand learnt to ride, as well as to talk the Irish tongue, and to seek\netymologies wherever they were or were not to be found.  But for a famous\nIrish cob, whose hoofs still sound in our ears, Borrow, so he says, might\nhave become a mere philologist.  From Ireland he returned with his\nparents to Norwich, and resumed studies, which must have been, from a\nschoolmaster's point of view, grievously interrupted, under the Rev.\nEdward Valpy at King Edward's School.  Here he seems to have been for two\nor three years.  Dr. Jessopp has told us the story of Borrow's dyeing his\nface with walnut juice, and Valpy gravely inquiring of him, 'Borrow, are\nyou suffering from jaundice, or is it only dirt?'   The Rajah of Sarawak,\nSir Archdale Wilson, and the Rev. James Martineau were at school with\n'Lavengro.'  Dr. Jessopp, who in 1859 became headmaster of King Edward's\nSchool, and who has been a Borrovian from the beginning, found the school\ntradition to be that Borrow, who never reached the sixth form, was\nindolent and even stupid.  In 1819,--the reader will be glad of a\ndate,--Borrow left school, and was articled to a solicitor in Norwich,\nand sat for some eight hours every day behind a lofty deal desk copying\ndeeds and, it may be presumed, making abstracts of title,--a harmless\npursuit which a year or two later entirely failed to engage the attention\nof young Mr. Benjamin Disraeli in Montague Place.  Neither of these\ndistinguished men can honestly be said ever to have acquired what is\ncalled the legal mind, a mental equipment which the younger of them had\nonce the effrontery to define as a talent for explaining the\nself-evident, illustrating the obvious and expatiating on the\ncommonplace.  'By adopting the law,' says Borrow, 'I had not ceased to be\nLavengro.'  He learnt Welsh when he should have been reading Blackstone.\nHe studied German under the direction of the once famous William Taylor\nof Norwich, who in 1821 wrote to Southey: 'A Norwich young man is\nconstruing with me Schiller's _William Tell_, with a view of translating\nit for the press.  His name is George Henry Borrow, and he has learnt\nGerman with extraordinary rapidity.  Indeed, he has the gift of tongues,\nand though not yet eighteen, understands twelve languages--English,\nWelsh, Erse, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, German, Danish, French, Italian,\nSpanish, and Portuguese.  He would like to get into the office for\nForeign Affairs, but does not know how.'\n\nIt only takes five years to make an attorney, and Borrow ought therefore,\nhad he served out his time, to have become a gentleman by Act of\nParliament in 1824 or 1825.  He did not do so, though he appears to have\nremained in Norwich until after 1826.  In that year appeared his\n_Romantic Ballads from the Danish_, printed by Simon Wilkins of Norwich\nby subscription.  Dr. Jessopp opines that the _Romantic Ballads_ must\nhave brought their translator 'a very respectable sum after paying all\nthe expenses of publication.'  I hope it was so, but, as Dr. Johnson once\nsaid about the immortality of the soul, I should like more evidence of\nit.  When Borrow left Norwich for London, it is hard to say.  It was\nafter the death of his father, and was not likely to have been later than\n1828.  His only introduction appears to have been one from William Taylor\nto Sir Richard Phillips, 'the publisher' known to all readers of\n_Lavengro_.  Sir Richard was one of the sheriffs of London and Middlesex,\nand in addition to sundry treatises on the duties of juries, was the\nauthor of two lucubrations, respectively entitled _The Phaenomena called\nby the name of Gravitation proved to be Proximate Effects of the\nOrbicular and Rotary Motions of the Earth and On the New Theory of the\nSystem of the Universe_.  In Watt's _Bibliotheca Britannica_, 1824, Sir\nRichard is thus contemptuously referred to: 'This personage is the editor\nof _The Monthly Magazine_, in which many of his effusions may be found\nwith the signature of \"Common Sense.\"'  It is not too much to say that\nbut for Borrow this nefarious man would be utterly forgotten; as it is,\nhe lives for ever in the pages of _Lavengro_, a hissing and a reproach.\nAuthors have an ugly trick of getting the better of their publishers in\nthe long run.  After leaving London Borrow began the wanderings described\nin _Lavengro_ and _The Romany Rye_.  Those concluded, probably in 1829 or\n1830, he crossed the British Channel, and like another Goldsmith,\nwandered on foot over the Continent of Europe, visiting France, Italy,\nAustria, and Russia.  Of his adventures in these countries there is\nunhappily no record.  In St. Petersburg he must have made a long stay,\nfor there he superintended the translation of the Bible into Mandschu-\nTartar, and published in 1835 his _Targum_; _or Metrical Translations\nfrom Thirty Languages and Dialects_.  In 1835 Borrow returned to London,\nand being already known to the Bible Society for his biblical labours in\nRussia, was offered, and accepted, the task of circulating the Scriptures\nin the Spanish Peninsula.  As for his labours in this field, which\noccupied him so agreeably for four or five years, are they not narrated\nin _The Bible in Spain_, a book first published by 'Glorious John Murray'\nin three volumes in 1843?  This is the book which made Borrow famous,\nthough his earlier work, _The Zincali_; _or an Account of the Gypsies of\nSpain_ (two vols. 1841), had attracted a good deal of notice.  But _The\nBible in Spain_ took readers by storm, and no wonder!  Sir Robert Peel\nnamed it in the House of Commons; its perusal imparted a new sensation,\nthe sensation of literature, to many a pious subscriber to the Bible\nSociety.  The book, wherever it went,--and it went where such like books\ndo not often go,--carried joy and rapture with it.  Young people hailed\nit tumultuously and cherished it tenderly.  There were four editions in\nthree volumes in the year of publication.  What was thought of the book\nby the Bible Society I do not know.  Perhaps 'he of the countenance of a\nlion,' of whom we read in the forty-fifth chapter of _Lavengro_, scarcely\nknew what to say about it; but the precise-looking man with the\nill-natured countenance, no doubt, forbade his family to read _The Bible\nin Spain_.\n\nIn 1840 Borrow married the widow of a naval officer and settled in\nNorfolk, where his aged mother was still living.  His house was in Oulton\nBroad; and here he became a notable, the hero of many stories, and the\nfriend of man, provided he was neither literary nor genteel.  Here also\nhe finished _Lavengro_ (1851), and wrote _The Romany Rye_ (1857), _Wild\nWales_ (1862), and _Romano Lavo-Lil_: _the Word-Book of the Romany_\n(1874).  For a time Borrow had a house in London in Hereford Square,\nwhere his wife died in 1869.  He died himself at Oulton in August 1881,\nleaving behind him, so it is frequently asserted, many manuscript\nvolumes, including treatises on Celtic poetry, on Welsh and Cornish and\nManx literature, as well as translations from the Norse and Russ and the\njest-books of Turkey.  Some, at all events, of these works were\nadvertised as 'ready for the press' in 1858.\n\n_The Bible in Spain_ was a popular book, and in 1843, the year of its\npublication, its author, a man of striking appearance, was much feted and\nregarded by the lion-hunters of the period.  Borrow did not take kindly\nto the den.  He was full of inbred suspicions and, perhaps, of\nunreasonable demands.  He resented the confinement of the dinner-table,\nthe impalement of the ball-room, the imprisonment of the pew.  Like the\nlion in Browning's poem, 'The Glove'--\n\n   You saw by the flash on his forehead,\n   By the hope in those eyes wide and steady,\n   He was leagues in the desert already,\n   Driving the flocks up the mountain.\n\nHe began to write _Lavengro_ in London in 1843.  His thoughts went back\nto his old friend Petulengro, who pronounced life to be sweet: 'There's\nnight and day, brother, both sweet things; sun, moon, and stars, brother,\nall sweet things.  There's likewise a wind on the heath.  Life is very\nsweet, brother; who would wish to die?'  Yes, or to live cribbed,\ncabined, and confined in a London square!  No wonder 'Lavengro' felt\ncross and uncomfortable.  Nor did he take much pleasure in the society of\nthe other lions of the hour, least of all of such a lion as Sir John\nBowring, M.P.  Was not Bowring 'Lavengro' as much as Borrow himself?  Had\nhe not--for there was no end to his impudence--travelled in Spain, and\nactually published a pamphlet in the vernacular?  Was he not meditating\ntranslations from a score of languages he said he knew?  Was he not,\nfurthermore, an old Radical and Republican turned genteel?  Were not his\nwife and daughters more than half suspected of being Jacobites, followers\nof the Reverend Mr. Platitude, and addicted to 'Charley o'er the\nWaterism'?  Borrow did not get on with Bowring.\n\nWhen Borrow shook the dust of London off his feet, and returned into\nNorfolk with _Lavengro_ barely begun on his hands, he carried away with\nhim into his retreat the antipathies and prejudices, the whimsical\ndislikes and the half-real, half-sham disappointments and chagrins which\nLondon, that fertile mother of megrims, had bred in him, and dropped them\nall into the ink with which he wrote his famous book.  Gentility he\nforswore.  Whatever else Lavengro might turn out, genteel he was not to\nbe; and sure enough, when Lavengro made his appearance in 1851 genteel he\nmost certainly was not.\n\nThere was not the same public to welcome the Gypsy as had hailed the\nColporteur.  The pious phrases which had garnished so plentifully the\nearlier book had now almost wholly disappeared.  There is no evidence\nthat Lavengro ever offered Petulengro a Bible.  Even the denunciations of\nPopery have a dubious sound.  What is sometimes called 'the religious\nworld' were no longer buyers of Borrow.  Nor was 'the polite world' much\nbetter pleased.  The polite reader was both puzzled and annoyed.  First\nof all: Was the book true--autobiography or romance?  A polite reader\nobjects to be made a fool of.  One De Foe in a couple of centuries is\nenough for a polite reader.  Then the glorification of ale and of gypsies\nand prize-fighters--would it not be better at once to dub the book\nvulgar, and so have done with it for ever?  An ill-regulated book, a\nstrange book, a mad book, a book which condemns the world's way.  If I\nmay judge from the reviews, this is how _Lavengro_ struck many, but by no\nmeans all.  The book had its passionate admirers, its lovers from the\nfirst.  Men, women, and boys took it to their hearts.  Happy day when\n_Lavengro_ first fell into boyish hands.  It brought adventure and the\nspirit of adventure to your doorstep.  No need painfully to walk to Hull,\nand there take shipping with Robinson Crusoe; no need to sail round the\nworld with Captain Cook, or even to shoot lions in Bechuanaland with that\nprince of missionaries, Mr. Robert Moffat; for were there not gypsies on\nthe common half a mile from one's homestead, and a dingle at the end of\nthe lane?  But the general verdict was, '\"Lavengro\" has gone too far.'\n\nBorrow was not the man to whistle and let the world go by.  His advice to\nhis country men and women was: 'To be courteous to everybody as Lavengro\nwas, but always independent like him, and if people meddle with them, to\ngive them as good as they bring, even as he and Isopel Berners were in\nthe habit of doing; and it will be as well for him to observe that he by\nno means advises women to be too womanly, but, bearing the conduct of\nIsopel Berners in mind, to take their own parts, and if anybody strikes\nthem to strike again.'\n\nThis is not the spirit which is patient under reproof.  Borrow was not\ngoing to be sentenced by the gentility party.  He would fulfil his\ndukkeripen.  _Lavengro_ having ended abruptly enough, Borrow took .up the\ntale where he had left it off; and though he kept his admirers on the\ntenter-hooks for six years, did at last in 1857 give to the world _The\nRomany Rye_, to which he added an Appendix.  Ah! that Appendix!  It is\nBorrow's Apologia, and therefore must be read.  It is interesting and\namusing, and is therefore easily read.  But it is a cruel and outrageous\nbit of writing all the same, proving, were proof needed, that it is every\nwhit as easy to be spiteful and envious in dells as in drawing-rooms, and\nas vain and egotistical on a Norfolk Broad as in Grosvenor Square.  In\nthis Appendix Borrow defends 'Lavengro,' both the book and the man, at\nsome length, and with enormous spirit.  At gentility in all its\nmanifestations he runs amuck.  The Stuarts have a chapter to themselves.\nJacobites, old and new; Papists, old and new; and, alas! Sir Walter Scott\nas the father of 'Charley o'er the Waterism,' all fall by turn under the\nlash of Lavengro.  The attack on the memory of Sir Walter is brutal.  Not\nso, we may be sure, did Pearce, and Cribb, and Spring, and Big Ben Brain,\nand Broughton, heroes of renown, win name and fame in the brave days of\nold.  They never struck a man when he was down, or gloated over a rival's\nfall.  However, it will not do to get angry with George Borrow.  One\ncould never keep it up.  Still, the Appendix is a pity.\n\nNext to Borrow's vagabondage, which, though I tremble to say it, has a\ndecidedly literary flavour, and his delightful _camaraderie_ or\nwillingness to hob-a-nob with everybody, I rank his eloquence.  Great is\nplot, though Borrow has but little, and that little mechanical;\ndelightful is incident, and Borrow is full of incident--e.g. the\npoisoning scene in Chapter LXXI., where will you match it, unless it be\nthe very differently-treated scene of the robbers' cave in _The Heart of\nMidlothian_? and glorious, too, is motion, and Borrow never stagnates,\nnever gathers moss or mould.  But great also is eloquence.  'If a book be\neloquent,' says Mr. Stevenson, that most distinguished writer, 'its words\nrun thenceforward in our ears like the noise of breakers.'  Eloquence is\na little unfashionable just now.  We are not allowed very much of it in\nour romances and travels.  What are called 'situations' grow stronger\nevery day, and language is strong too, but outbursts, apostrophes,\nrhapsodies no longer abound.  Perhaps they are forbidden by Art.  Nobody\nis ever eloquent in real life.  A man's friends would not put up with it.\nBut a really eloquent book is a great possession.  Plots explode, and\nincidents, however varied and delightful, unless lit up by the occasional\nlightning-flash of true eloquence, must after a while lose their\nfreshness.  Borrow was not afraid to be eloquent, nor were other writers\nof his time.  The first Lord Lytton is now a somewhat disparaged author,\nnor had Borrow any affection for him, considering him to belong to the\nkid-glove school; but Lytton's eloquence, though often playing him shabby\ntricks, now dashing his head against the rocks of bathos, now casting him\nto sprawl unbecomingly amongst the oozy weeds of sentiment, will keep him\nalive for many a long day.  As I write, a passage in _The Caxtons_ comes\nto my mind, and as it illustrates my meaning, I will take down _The\nCaxtons_ and transcribe the passage, and let those laugh who may.  I will\nlikewise christen it 'By the Fireside':--\n\n   O young reader, whoever thou art, or reader at least who has been\n   young, canst thou not remember some time when, with thy wild troubles\n   and sorrows as yet borne in secret, thou hast come back from that\n   hard, stern world, which opens on thee when thou puttest thy foot out\n   of the threshold of home, come back to the four quiet walls, wherein\n   thine elders sit in peace, and seen with a sort of sad amaze how calm\n   and undisturbed all is there?  That generation which has gone before\n   thee in the path of passion, the generation of thy parents (not so\n   many years, perchance, remote from thine own), how immovably far off,\n   in its still repose, it seems from thy turbulent youth.  It has in it\n   a stillness as of a classic age, antique as the statues of the Greeks,\n   that tranquil monotony of routine into which those lives that preceded\n   thee have merged, the occupations that they have found sufficing for\n   their happiness by the fireside--in the arm-chair and corner\n   appropriated to each--how strangely they contrast thy own feverish\n   excitement!  And they make room for thee, and bid thee welcome, and\n   then resettle to their hushed pursuits as if nothing had happened!\n   Nothing had happened! while in thy heart, perhaps, the whole world\n   seems to have shot from its axis, all the elements to be at war!  And\n   you sit down, crushed by that quiet happiness which you can share no\n   more, and smile mechanically, and look into the fire; and, ten to one,\n   you say nothing till the time comes for bed, and you take up your\n   candle, and creep miserably to your lonely room.\n\nThis is not the eloquence of Borrow, though the thought might have been\nhis; it may not be in that grand style of which we hear so much and read\nso little, but--and this is the substance of the matter--it is\ninteresting, it is moving, and worth pages of choppy dialogue.  You read\nit, first of all, it may be in your youth, when your heart burnt within\nyou as you wondered what was going to happen, but you can return to it in\nsober age and read it over again with a smile it has taken a lifetime to\nmanufacture.  And then Miss Bronte's books! what rhetoric is there!  And\n_Eothen_!  Why has not _Eothen_ gone the way of all other traces of\nEastern travel?  It has humour--delightful humour, no doubt, but it is\nits eloquence, that picture of the burning, beating sun following the\ntraveller by day, which keeps _Eothen_ alive.\n\nBorrow's eloquence is splendid, manly, and desperately courageous.  What\nan apostrophe is that to old Crome at the end of the twenty-first\nchapter!  _Lavengro_ is full of riches.  As for his courage, who else\ncould begin a passage 'O England,' and emerge triumphantly a page and a\nhalf lower down as Borrow does in _The Bible in Spain_?\n\n   O England! long, long may it be ere the sun of thy glory sink beneath\n   the wave of darkness!  Though gloomy and portentous clouds are now\n   gathering rapidly round thee, still, still may it please the Almighty\n   to disperse them, and to grant thee a futurity longer in duration and\n   still brighter in renown than thy past!  Or if thy doom be at hand,\n   may that doom be a noble one, and worthy of her who has been styled\n   the Old Queen of the water!  May thou sink, if thou dost sink, amidst\n   blood and flame, with a mighty noise, causing more than one nation to\n   participate in thy downfall!  Of all fates, may it please the Lord to\n   preserve thee from a disgraceful and a slow decay; becoming ere\n   extinct a scorn and a mockery for those self-same foes who now, though\n   they envy and abhor thee, still fear thee, nay, even against their\n   will, honour and respect thee!\n\n   Arouse thee, whilst yet there is time, and prepare thee for the combat\n   of life and death!  Cast from thee the foul scurf which now encrusts\n   thy robust limbs, which deadens their force, and makes them heavy and\n   powerless!  Cast from thee thy false philosophers, who would fain\n   decry what, next to the love of God, has hitherto been deemed most\n   sacred, the love of the mother land!  Cast from thee thy false\n   patriots, who, under the pretext of redressing the wrongs of the poor\n   and weak, seek to promote internal discord, so that thou mayest become\n   only terrible to thyself!  And remove from thee the false prophets who\n   have seen vanity and divined lies; who have daubed thy wall with\n   untempered mortar, that it may fall; who have strengthened the hands\n   of the wicked, and made the hearts of the righteous sad.  O, do this,\n   and fear not the result, for either shall thy end be a majestic and an\n   enviable one, or God shall perpetuate thy reign upon the waters, thou\n   old Queen!\n\nGeorge Borrow,--and this is the last of his virtues with which I shall\nweary you,--had a true English heart.  He could make friends with anybody\nand be at home anywhere, but though he had a mighty thirst he had never,\nin the words of the elder Pitt, 'drunk of the potion described in poetic\nfictions which makes men forget their country.'\n\nI have the permission of the Rev. A. W. Upcher to reprint the following\nletter addressed by him some time ago to the Athenaeum .--\n\n   One summer day during the Crimean War we had a call from George\n   Borrow, who had not enjoyed a visit to Anna Gurney so much as he had\n   expected.  In a walking tour round Norfolk he had given her a short\n   notice of his intended call, and she was ready to receive him.  When,\n   according to his account, he had been but a very short time in her\n   presence, she wheeled her chair round and reached her hand to one of\n   her bookshelves and took down an Arabic grammar, and put it into his\n   hand, asking for explanation of some difficult point, which he tried\n   to decipher; but meanwhile she talked to him continuously; when, said\n   he, 'I could not study the Arabic grammar and listen to her at the\n   same time, so I threw down the book and ran out of the room.'  He\n   seems not to have stopped running till he reached Old Tucker's Inn at\n   Cromer, where he renewed his strength, or calmed his temper, with five\n   excellent sausages, and then came on to Sheringham.  He told us there\n   were three personages in the world whom he always had a desire to see;\n   two of these had slipped through his fingers, so he was determined to\n   see the third.  'Pray, Mr. Borrow, who were they?'  He held up three\n   fingers of his left hand and pointed them off with the forefinger of\n   the right: the first, Daniel O'Connell; the second, Lamplighter (the\n   sire of Phosphorus, Lord Berners's winner of the Derby); the third,\n   Anna Gurney.  The first two were dead and he had not seen them; now he\n   had come to see Anna Gurney, and this was the end of his visit.  I\n   took him up to the Hall, he talking of many persons and occasionally\n   doubling his fist, and giving a sort of warning like that of his\n   Isopel Berners (in _Lavengro_) to give the Flaming Tinman 'Long\n   Melford' with his right hand.  As soon as we reached the Hall a battle-\n   piece by Wouvermans was the first thing that caught his eye and\n   greatly interested him.  He told me of a descendant of Wouvermans--an\n   officer in the Austrian army--whom he knew.  Then entering the drawing-\n   room and looking out of the bay-window through the oak wood on the\n   deep blue sea beyond, he seemed for some time quite entranced by the\n   lovely, peaceful view, till at last I felt I must arouse him, and\n   said, 'A charming view, Mr. Borrow!'  With a deep sigh he slowly\n   answered, 'Yes!--please God the Russians don't come here.'\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE\n\n\nIn the following pages I have endeavoured to describe a dream, partly of\nstudy, partly of adventure, in which will be found copious notices of\nbooks, and many descriptions of life and manners, some in a very unusual\nform.\n\nThe scenes of action lie in the British Islands;--pray be not displeased,\ngentle reader, if perchance thou hast imagined that I was about to\nconduct thee to distant lands, and didst promise thyself much instruction\nand entertainment from what I might tell thee of them.  I do assure thee\nthat thou hast no reason to be displeased, inasmuch as there are no\ncountries in the world less known by the British than these selfsame\nBritish Islands, or where more strange things are every day occurring,\nwhether in road or street, house or dingle.\n\nThe time embraces nearly the first quarter of the present century: this\ninformation again may, perhaps, be anything but agreeable to thee; it is\na long time to revert to, but fret not thyself, many matters which at\npresent much occupy the public mind originated in some degree towards the\nlatter end of that period, and some of them will be treated of.\n\nThe principal actors in this dream, or drama, are, as you will have\ngathered from the title-page, a Scholar, a Gypsy, and a Priest.  Should\nyou imagine that these three form one, permit me to assure you that you\nare very much mistaken.  Should there be something of the Gypsy manifest\nin the Scholar, there is certainly nothing of the Priest.  With respect\nto the Gypsy--decidedly the most entertaining character of the\nthree--there is certainly nothing of the Scholar or the Priest in him;\nand as for the Priest, though there may be something in him both of\nscholarship and gypsyism, neither the Scholar nor the Gypsy would feel at\nall flattered by being confounded with him.\n\nMany characters which may be called subordinate will be found, and it is\nprobable that some of these characters will afford much more interest to\nthe reader than those styled the principal.  The favourites with the\nwriter are a brave old soldier and his helpmate, an ancient gentlewoman\nwho sold apples, and a strange kind of wandering man and his wife.\n\nAmongst the many things attempted in this book is the encouragement of\ncharity, and free and genial manners, and the exposure of humbug, of\nwhich there are various kinds, but of which the most perfidious, the most\ndebasing, and the most cruel, is the humbug of the Priest.\n\nYet let no one think that irreligion is advocated in this book.  With\nrespect to religious tenets I wish to observe that I am a member of the\nChurch of England, into whose communion I was baptized, and to which my\nforefathers belonged.  Its being the religion in which I was baptized,\nand of my forefathers, would be a strong inducement to me to cling to it;\nfor I do not happen to be one of those choice spirits 'who turn from\ntheir banner when the battle bears strongly against it, and go over to\nthe enemy,' and who receive at first a hug and a 'viva,' and in the\nsequel contempt and spittle in the face; but my chief reason for\nbelonging to it is, because, of all churches calling themselves Christian\nones, I believe there is none so good, so well founded upon Scripture, or\nwhose ministers are, upon the whole, so exemplary in their lives and\nconversation, so well read in the book from which they preach, or so\nversed in general learning, so useful in their immediate neighbourhoods,\nor so unwilling to persecute people of other denominations for matters of\ndoctrine.\n\nIn the communion of this Church, and with the religious consolation of\nits ministers, I wish and hope to live and die, and in its and their\ndefence will at all times be ready, if required, to speak, though humbly,\nand to fight, though feebly, against enemies, whether carnal or\nspiritual.\n\nAnd is there no priestcraft in the Church of England?  There is\ncertainly, or rather there was, a modicum of priestcraft in the Church of\nEngland, but I have generally found that those who are most vehement\nagainst the Church of England are chiefly dissatisfied with her because\nthere is only a modicum of that article in her--were she stuffed to the\nvery cupola with it, like a certain other Church, they would have much\nless to say against the Church of England.\n\nBy the other Church, I mean Rome.  Its system was once prevalent in\nEngland, and, during the period that it prevailed there, was more\nprolific of debasement and crime than all other causes united.  The\npeople and the government at last becoming enlightened by means of the\nScripture spurned it from the island with disgust and horror, the land\ninstantly after its disappearance becoming a fair field, in which arts,\nsciences, and all the amiable virtues flourished, instead of being a\npestilent marsh where swine-like ignorance wallowed, and artful\nhypocrites, like so many Wills-o'-the-wisp, played antic gambols about,\naround, and above debased humanity.\n\nBut Popery still wished to play her old part, to regain her lost\ndominion, to reconvert the smiling land into the pestilential morass,\nwhere she could play again her old antics.  From the period of the\nReformation in England up to the present time, she has kept her\nemissaries here, individuals contemptible in intellect, it is true, but\ncat-like and gliding, who, at her bidding, have endeavoured, as much as\nin their power has lain, to damp and stifle every genial, honest, loyal,\nand independent thought, and to reduce minds to such a state of dotage as\nwould enable their old Popish mother to do what she pleased with them.\n\nAnd in every country, however enlightened, there are always minds\ninclined to grovelling superstition--minds fond of eating dust and\nswallowing clay--minds never at rest, save when prostrate before some\nfellow in a surplice; and these Popish emissaries found always some weak\nenough to bow down before them, astounded by their dreadful denunciations\nof eternal woe and damnation to any who should refuse to believe their\nRomania; but they played a poor game--the law protected the servants of\nScripture, and the priest with his beads seldom ventured to approach any\nbut the remnant of those of the eikonolatry--representatives of\nworm-eaten houses, their debased dependants, and a few poor crazy\ncreatures amongst the middle classes--he played a poor game, and the\nlabour was about to prove almost entirely in vain, when the English\nlegislature, in compassion or contempt, or, yet more probably, influenced\nby that spirit of toleration and kindness which is so mixed up with\nProtestantism, removed almost entirely the disabilities under which\nPopery laboured, and enabled it to raise its head and to speak out almost\nwithout fear.\n\nAnd it did raise its head, and, though it spoke with some little fear at\nfirst, soon discarded every relic of it; went about the land uttering its\ndamnation cry, gathering around it--and for doing so many thanks to\nit--the favourers of priestcraft who lurked within the walls of the\nChurch of England; frightening with the loudness of its voice the weak,\nthe timid, and the ailing; perpetrating, whenever it had an opportunity,\nthat species of crime to which it has ever been most partial--_Deathbed\nrobbery_; for as it is cruel, so is it dastardly.  Yes, it went on\nenlisting, plundering, and uttering its terrible threats till--till it\nbecame, as it always does when left to itself, a fool, a very fool.  Its\nplunderings might have been overlooked, and so might its insolence, had\nit been common insolence, but it--, and then the roar of indignation\nwhich arose from outraged England against the viper, the frozen viper,\nwhich it had permitted to warm itself upon its bosom.\n\nBut thanks, Popery, you have done all that the friends of enlightenment\nand religious liberty could wish; but if ever there were a set of foolish\nones to be found under heaven, surely it is the priestly rabble who came\nover from Rome to direct the grand movement--so long in its getting up.\n\nBut now again the damnation cry is withdrawn, there is a subdued meekness\nin your demeanour, you are now once more harmless as a lamb.  Well, we\nshall see how the trick--'the old trick'--will serve you.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\nBirth--My father--Tamerlane--Ben Brain--French Protestants--East\nAnglia--Sorrow and troubles--True peace--A beautiful child--Foreign\ngrave--Mirrors--Alpine country--Emblems--Slow of speech--The Jew--Strange\ngestures.\n\nOn an evening of July, in the year 18--, at East D---, a beautiful little\ntown in a certain district of East Anglia, I first saw the light.\n\nMy father was a Cornish man, the youngest, as I have heard him say, of\nseven brothers.  He sprang from a family of gentlemen, or, as some people\nwould call them, gentillatres, for they were not very wealthy; they had a\ncoat of arms, however, and lived on their own property at a place called\nTredinnock, which being interpreted means _the house on the hill_, which\nhouse and the neighbouring acres had been from time immemorial in their\npossession.  I mention these particulars that the reader may see at once\nthat I am not altogether of low and plebeian origin; the present age is\nhighly aristocratic, and I am convinced that the public will read my\npages with more zest from being told that I am a gentillatre by birth\nwith Cornish blood {5} in my veins, of a family who lived on their own\nproperty at a place bearing a Celtic name, signifying the house on the\nhill, or more strictly the house on the _hillock_.\n\nMy father was what is generally termed a posthumous child--in other\nwords, the gentillatre who begot him never had the satisfaction of\ninvoking the blessing of the Father of All upon his head; having departed\nthis life some months before the birth of his youngest son.  The boy,\ntherefore, never knew a father's care; he was, however, well tended by\nhis mother, whose favourite he was; so much so, indeed, that his\nbrethren, the youngest of whom was considerably older than himself, were\nrather jealous of him.  I never heard, however, that they treated him\nwith any marked unkindness, and it will be as well to observe here that I\nam by no means well acquainted with his early history, of which, indeed,\nas I am not writing his life, it is not necessary to say much.  Shortly\nafter his mother's death, which occurred when he was eighteen, he adopted\nthe profession of arms, which he followed during the remainder of his\nlife, and in which, had circumstances permitted, he would probably have\nshone amongst the best.  By nature he was cool and collected, slow to\nanger, though perfectly fearless, patient of control, of great strength;\nand, to crown all, a proper man with his hands.\n\nWith far inferior qualifications many a man has become a field-marshal or\ngeneral; similar ones made Tamerlane, who was not a gentillatre, but the\nson of a blacksmith, emperor of one-third of the world; but the race is\nnot always for the swift, nor the battle for the strong, indeed I ought\nrather to say very seldom; certain it is, that my father, with all his\nhigh military qualifications, never became emperor, field-marshal, or\neven general: indeed, he had never an opportunity of distinguishing\nhimself save in one battle, and that took place neither in Flanders,\nEgypt, nor on the banks of the Indus or Oxus, but in Hyde Park.\n\nSmile not, gentle reader, many a battle has been fought in Hyde Park, in\nwhich as much skill, science, and bravery have been displayed as ever\nachieved a victory in Flanders or by the Indus.  In such a combat as that\nto which I allude, I opine that even Wellington or Napoleon would have\nbeen heartily glad to cry for quarter ere the lapse of five minutes, and\neven the Blacksmith Tartar would, perhaps, have shrunk from the opponent\nwith whom, after having had a dispute with him, my father engaged in\nsingle combat for one hour, at the end of which time the champions shook\nhands and retired, each having experienced quite enough of the other's\nprowess.  The name of my father's antagonist was Brain.\n\nWhat! still a smile? did you never hear that name before?  I cannot help\nit!  Honour to Brain, who four months after the event which I have now\nnarrated was champion of England, having conquered the heroic Johnson.\nHonour to Brain, who, at the end of other four months, worn out by the\ndreadful blows which he had received in his manly combats, expired in the\narms of my father, who read the Bible to him in his latter moments--Big\nBen Brain.\n\nYou no longer smile, even _you_ have heard of Big Ben.\n\nI have already hinted that my father never rose to any very exalted rank\nin his profession, notwithstanding his prowess and other qualifications.\nAfter serving for many years in the line, he at last entered as captain\nin the militia regiment of the Earl of ---, at that period just raised,\nand to which he was sent by the Duke of York to instruct the young levies\nin military manoeuvres and discipline; and in this mission I believe he\nperfectly succeeded, competent judges having assured me that the regiment\nin question soon came by his means to be considered as one of the most\nbrilliant in the service, and inferior to no regiment of the line in\nappearance or discipline.\n\nAs the headquarters of this corps were at D--- the duties of my father\nnot unfrequently carried him to that place, and it was on one of these\noccasions that he became acquainted with a young person of the\nneighbourhood, for whom he formed an attachment, which was returned; and\nthis young person was my mother.\n\nShe was descended from a family of French Protestants, natives of Caen,\nwho were obliged to leave their native country when old Louis, at the\ninstigation of the Pope, thought fit to revoke the Edict of Nantes: their\nname was Petrement, and I have reason for believing that they were people\nof some consideration; that they were noble hearts, and good Christians,\nthey gave sufficient proof in scorning to bow the knee to the tyranny of\nRome.  So they left beautiful Normandy for their faith's sake, and with a\nfew louis d'ors in their purse, a Bible in the vulgar tongue, and a\ncouple of old swords, which, if report be true, had done service in the\nHuguenot wars, they crossed the sea to the isle of civil peace and\nreligious liberty, and established themselves in East Anglia.\n\nAnd many other Huguenot families bent their steps thither, and devoted\nthemselves to agriculture or the mechanical arts; and in the venerable\nold city, the capital of the province, in the northern shadow of the\nCastle of De Burgh, the exiles built for themselves a church where they\npraised God in the French tongue, and to which, at particular seasons of\nthe year, they were in the habit of flocking from country and from town\nto sing--\n\n'Thou hast provided for us a goodly earth; thou waterest her furrows,\nthou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof, thou makest it soft\nwith the drops of rain, and blessest the increase of it.'\n\nI have been told that in her younger days my mother was strikingly\nhandsome; this I can easily believe: I never knew her in her youth, for\nthough she was very young when she married my father (who was her senior\nby many years), she had attained the middle age before I was born, no\nchildren having been vouchsafed to my parents in the early stages of\ntheir union.  Yet even at the present day, now that years threescore and\nten have passed over her head, attended with sorrow and troubles\nmanifold, poorly chequered with scanty joys, can I look on that\ncountenance and doubt that at one time beauty decked it as with a\nglorious garment?  Hail to thee, my parent! as thou sittest there, in thy\nwidow's weeds, in the dusky parlour in the house overgrown with the\nlustrous ivy of the sister isle, the solitary house at the end of the\nretired court shaded by lofty poplars.  Hail to thee, dame of the oval\nface, olive complexion, and Grecian forehead; by thy table seated with\nthe mighty volume of the good Bishop Hopkins spread out before thee;\nthere is peace in thy countenance, my mother; it is not worldly peace,\nhowever, not the deceitful peace which lulls to bewitching slumbers, and\nfrom which, let us pray, humbly pray, that every sinner may be roused in\ntime to implore mercy not in vain!  Thine is the peace of the righteous,\nmy mother, of those to whom no sin can be imputed, the score of whose\nmisdeeds has been long since washed away by the blood of atonement, which\nimputeth righteousness to those who trust in it.  It was not always thus,\nmy mother; a time was, when the cares, pomps, and vanities of this world\nagitated thee too much; but that time is gone by, another and a better\nhas succeeded; there is peace now on thy countenance, the true peace;\npeace around thee, too, in thy solitary dwelling, sounds of peace, the\ncheerful hum of the kettle and the purring of the immense angola, which\nstares up at thee from its settle with its almost human eyes.\n\nNo more earthly cares and affections now, my mother!  Yes, one.  Why dost\nthou suddenly raise thy dark and still brilliant eye from the volume with\na somewhat startled glance?  What noise is that in the distant street?\nMerely the noise of a hoof; a sound common enough: it draws nearer,\nnearer, and now it stops before thy gate.  Singular!  And now there is a\npause, a long pause.  Ha! thou hearest something--a footstep; a swift but\nheavy footstep! thou risest, thou tremblest, there is a hand on the pin\nof the outer door, there is some one in the vestibule, and now the door\nof thy apartment opens, there is a reflection on the mirror behind thee,\na travelling hat, a gray head and sunburnt face.  My dearest Son!--My\ndarling Mother!\n\nYes, mother, thou didst recognise in the distant street the hoof-tramp of\nthe wanderer's horse.\n\nI was not the only child of my parents; I had a brother some three years\nolder than myself.  He was a beautiful child; one of those occasionally\nseen in England, and in England alone; a rosy, angelic face, blue eyes,\nand light chestnut hair; it was not exactly an Anglo-Saxon countenance,\nin which, by the bye, there is generally a cast of loutishness and\nstupidity; it partook, to a certain extent, of the Celtic character,\nparticularly in the fire and vivacity which illumined it; his face was\nthe mirror of his mind; perhaps no disposition more amiable was ever\nfound amongst the children of Adam, united, however, with no\ninconsiderable portion of high and dauntless spirit.  So great was his\nbeauty in infancy, that people, especially those of the poorer classes,\nwould follow the nurse who carried him about in order to look at and\nbless his lovely face.  At the age of three months an attempt was made to\nsnatch him from his mother's arms in the streets of London, at the moment\nshe was about to enter a coach; indeed, his appearance seemed to operate\nso powerfully upon every person who beheld him, that my parents were\nunder continual apprehension of losing him; his beauty, however, was\nperhaps surpassed by the quickness of his parts.  He mastered his letters\nin a few hours, and in a day or two could decipher the names of people on\nthe doors of houses and over the shop-windows.\n\nAs he grew up, his personal appearance became less prepossessing, his\nquickness and cleverness, however, rather increased; and I may say of\nhim, that with respect to everything which he took in hand he did it\nbetter and more speedily than any other person.  Perhaps it will be asked\nhere, what became of him?  Alas! alas! his was an early and a foreign\ngrave.  As I have said before, the race is not always for the swift, nor\nthe battle for the strong.\n\nAnd now, doubtless, after the above portrait of my brother, painted in\nthe very best style of Rubens, the reader will conceive himself justified\nin expecting a full-length one of myself, as a child, for as to my\npresent appearance, I suppose he will be tolerably content with that\nflitting glimpse in the mirror.  But he must excuse me; I have no\nintention of drawing a portrait of myself in childhood; indeed it would\nbe difficult, for at that time I never looked into mirrors.  No attempts,\nhowever, were ever made to steal me in my infancy, and I never heard that\nmy parents entertained the slightest apprehension of losing me by the\nhands of kidnappers, though I remember perfectly well that people were in\nthe habit of standing still to look at me, ay, more than at my brother;\nfrom which premisses the reader may form any conclusion with respect to\nmy appearance which seemeth good unto him and reasonable.  Should he,\nbeing a good-natured person, and always inclined to adopt the charitable\nside in any doubtful point, be willing to suppose that I, too, was\neminently endowed by nature with personal graces, I tell him frankly that\nI have no objection whatever to his entertaining that idea; moreover,\nthat I heartily thank him, and shall at all times be disposed, under\nsimilar circumstances, to exercise the same species of charity towards\nhimself.\n\nWith respect to my mind and its qualities I shall be more explicit; for,\nwere I to maintain much reserve on this point, many things which appear\nin these memoirs would be highly mysterious to the reader, indeed\nincomprehensible.  Perhaps no two individuals were ever more unlike in\nmind and disposition than my brother and myself: as light is opposed to\ndarkness, so was that happy, brilliant, cheerful child to the sad and\nmelancholy being who sprang from the same stock as himself, and was\nnurtured by the same milk.\n\nOnce, when travelling in an Alpine country, I arrived at a considerable\nelevation; I saw in the distance, far below, a beautiful stream hastening\nto the ocean, its rapid waters here sparkling in the sunshine, and there\ntumbling merrily in cascades.  On its banks were vineyards and cheerful\nvillages; close to where I stood, in a granite basin with steep and\nprecipitous sides, slumbered a deep, dark lagoon, shaded by black pines,\ncypresses, and yews.  It was a wild, savage spot, strange and singular;\nravens hovered above the pines, filling the air with their uncouth notes,\npies chattered, and I heard the cry of an eagle from a neighbouring peak;\nthere lay the lake, the dark, solitary, and almost inaccessible lake;\ngloomy shadows were upon it, which, strangely modified, as gusts of wind\nagitated the surface, occasionally assumed the shape of monsters.  So I\nstood on the Alpine elevation, and looked now on the gay distant river,\nand now at the dark granite-encircled lake close beside me in the lone\nsolitude, and I thought of my brother and myself.  I am no moraliser; but\nthe gay and rapid river, and the dark and silent lake, were, of a verity,\nno had emblems of us two.\n\nSo far from being quick and clever like my brother, and able to rival the\nliterary feat which I have recorded of him, many years elapsed before I\nwas able to understand the nature of letters, or to connect them.  A\nlover of nooks and retired corners, I was as a child in the habit of\nfleeing from society, and of sitting for hours together with my head on\nmy breast.  What I was thinking about, it would be difficult to say at\nthis distance of time; I remember perfectly well, however, being ever\nconscious of a peculiar heaviness within me, and at times of a strange\nsensation of fear, which occasionally amounted to horror, and for which I\ncould assign no real cause whatever.\n\nBy nature slow of speech, I took no pleasure in conversation, nor in\nhearing the voices of my fellow-creatures.  When people addressed me, I\nnot unfrequently, especially if they were strangers, turned away my head\nfrom them, and if they persisted in their notice burst into tears, which\nsingularity of behaviour by no means tended to dispose people in my\nfavour.  I was as much disliked as my brother was deservedly beloved and\nadmired.  My parents, it is true, were always kind to me; and my brother,\nwho was good nature itself, was continually lavishing upon me every mark\nof affection.\n\nThere was, however, one individual who, in the days of my childhood, was\ndisposed to form a favourable opinion of me.  One day, a Jew--I have\nquite forgotten the circumstance, but I was long subsequently informed of\nit--one day a travelling Jew knocked at the door of a farmhouse in which\nwe had taken apartments; I was near at hand sitting in the bright\nsunshine, drawing strange lines on the dust with my fingers, an ape and\ndog were my companions; the Jew looked at me and asked me some questions,\nto which, though I was quite able to speak, I returned no answer.  On the\ndoor being opened, the Jew, after a few words, probably relating to\npedlery, demanded who the child was, sitting in the sun; the maid replied\nthat I was her mistress's youngest son, a child weak _here_, pointing to\nher forehead.  The Jew looked at me again, and then said: ''Pon my\nconscience, my dear, I believe that you must be troubled there yourself\nto tell me any such thing.  It is not my habit to speak to children,\ninasmuch as I hate them, because they often follow me and fling stones\nafter me; but I no sooner looked at that child than I was forced to speak\nto it--his not answering me shows his sense, for it has never been the\ncustom of the wise to fling away their words in indifferent talk and\nconversation; the child is a sweet child, and has all the look of one of\nour people's children.  Fool, indeed! did I not see his eyes sparkle just\nnow when the monkey seized the dog by the ear?--they shone like my own\ndiamonds--does your good lady want any--real and fine?  Were it not for\nwhat you tell me, I should say it was a prophet's child.  Fool, indeed!\nhe can write already, or I'll forfeit the box which I carry on my back,\nand for which I should be loth to take two hundred pounds!'  He then\nleaned forward to inspect the lines which I had traced.  All of a sudden\nhe started back, and grew white as a sheet; then, taking off his hat, he\nmade some strange gestures to me, cringing, chattering, and showing his\nteeth, and shortly departed, muttering something about 'holy letters,'\nand talking to himself in a strange tongue.  The words of the Jew were in\ndue course of time reported to my mother, who treasured them in her\nheart, and from that moment began to entertain brighter hopes of her\nyoungest born than she had ever before ventured to foster.\n\n{picture:All of a sudden he started back, and grew white as a sheet:\npage13.jpg}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\nBarracks and lodgings--A camp--The viper--A delicate child--Blackberry\ntime--_Meun_ and _tuum_--Hythe--The Golgotha--Daneman's skull--Superhuman\nstature--Stirring times--The sea-bord.\n\nI have been a wanderer the greater part of my life; indeed I remember\nonly two periods, and these by no means lengthy, when I was, strictly\nspeaking, stationary.  I was a soldier's son, and as the means of my\nfather were by no means sufficient to support two establishments, his\nfamily invariably attended him wherever he went, so that from my infancy\nI was accustomed to travelling and wandering, and looked upon a monthly\nchange of scene and residence as a matter of course.  Sometimes we lived\nin barracks, sometimes in lodgings, but generally in the former, always\neschewing the latter from motives of economy, save when the barracks were\ninconvenient and uncomfortable; and they must have been highly so indeed,\nto have discouraged us from entering them; for though we were gentry\n(pray bear that in mind, gentle reader), gentry by birth, and\nincontestably so by my father's bearing the commission of good old George\nthe Third, we were not _fine gentry_, but people who could put up with as\nmuch as any genteel Scotch family who find it convenient to live on a\nthird floor in London, or on a sixth at Edinburgh or Glasgow.  It was not\na little that could discourage us: we once lived within the canvas walls\nof a camp, at a place called Pett, in Sussex; and I believe it was at\nthis place that occurred the first circumstance, or adventure, call it\nwhich you will, that I can remember in connection with myself: it was a\nstrange one, and I will relate it.\n\nIt happened that my brother and myself were playing one evening in a\nsandy lane, in the neighbourhood of this Pett camp; our mother was at a\nslight distance.  All of a sudden, a bright yellow, and, to my infantine\neye, beautiful and glorious, object made its appearance at the top of the\nbank from between the thick quickset, and, gliding down, began to move\nacross the lane to the other side, like a line of golden light.  Uttering\na cry of pleasure, I sprang forward, and seized it nearly by the middle.\nA strange sensation of numbing coldness seemed to pervade my whole arm,\nwhich surprised me the more, as the object to the eye appeared so warm\nand sunlike.  I did not drop it, however, but, holding it up, looked at\nit intently, as its head dangled about a foot from my hand.  It made no\nresistance; I felt not even the slightest struggle; but now my brother\nbegan to scream and shriek like one possessed.  'O mother, mother!' said\nhe, 'the viper!--my brother has a viper in his hand!'  He then, like one\nfrantic, made an effort to snatch the creature away from me.  The viper\nnow hissed amain, and raised its head, in which were eyes like hot coals,\nmenacing, not myself, but my brother.  I dropped my captive, for I saw my\nmother running towards me; and the reptile, after standing for a moment\nnearly erect, and still hissing furiously, made off, and disappeared.  The\nwhole scene is now before me, as vividly as if it occurred yesterday--the\ngorgeous viper, my poor dear frantic brother, my agitated parent, and a\nfrightened hen clucking under the bushes--and yet I was not three years\nold.\n\nIt is my firm belief that certain individuals possess an inherent power,\nor fascination, over certain creatures, otherwise I should be unable to\naccount for many feats which I have witnessed, and, indeed, borne a share\nin, connected with the taming of brutes and reptiles.  I have known a\nsavage and vicious mare, whose stall it was dangerous to approach, even\nwhen bearing provender, welcome, nevertheless, with every appearance of\npleasure, an uncouth, wiry-headed man, with a frightfully seamed face,\nand an iron hook supplying the place of his right hand, one whom the\nanimal had never seen before, playfully bite his hair, and cover his face\nwith gentle and endearing kisses; and I have already stated how a viper\nwould permit, without resentment, one child to take it up in his hand,\nwhilst it showed its dislike to the approach of another by the fiercest\nhissings.  Philosophy can explain many strange things, but there are some\nwhich are a far pitch above her, and this is one.\n\nI should scarcely relate another circumstance which occurred about this\ntime but for a singular effect which it produced upon my constitution.  Up\nto this period I had been rather a delicate child; whereas, almost\nimmediately after the occurrence to which I allude, I became both hale\nand vigorous, to the great astonishment of my parents, who naturally\nenough expected that it would produce quite a contrary effect.\n\nIt happened that my brother and myself were disporting ourselves in\ncertain fields near the good town of Canterbury.  A female servant had\nattended us, in order to take care that we came to no mischief: she,\nhowever, it seems, had matters of her own to attend to, and, allowing us\nto go where we listed, remained in one corner of a field, in earnest\nconversation with a red-coated dragoon.  Now it chanced to be blackberry\ntime, and the two children wandered under the hedges, peering anxiously\namong them in quest of that trash so grateful to urchins of their degree.\nWe did not find much of it, however, and were soon separated in the\npursuit.  All at once I stood still, and could scarcely believe my eyes.\nI had come to a spot where, almost covering the hedge, hung clusters of\nwhat seemed fruit--deliciously-tempting fruit--something resembling\ngrapes of various colours, green, red, and purple.  Dear me, thought I,\nhow fortunate! yet have I a right to gather it? is it mine? for the\nobservance of the law of _meum_ and _tuum_ had early been impressed upon\nmy mind, and I entertained, even at that tender age, the utmost horror\nfor theft; so I stood staring at the variegated clusters, in doubt as to\nwhat I should do.  I know not how I argued the matter in my mind; the\ntemptation, however, was at last too strong for me, so I stretched forth\nmy hand and ate.  I remember, perfectly well, that the taste of this\nstrange fruit was by no means so pleasant as the appearance; but the idea\nof eating fruit was sufficient for a child, and, after all, the flavour\nwas much superior to that of sour apples, so I ate voraciously.  How long\nI continued eating I scarcely know.  One thing is certain, that I never\nleft the field as I entered it, being carried home in the arms of the\ndragoon in strong convulsions, in which I continued for several hours.\nAbout midnight I awoke, as if from a troubled sleep, and beheld my\nparents bending over my couch, whilst the regimental surgeon, with a\ncandle in his hand, stood nigh, the light feebly reflected on the\nwhitewashed walls of the barrack-room.\n\nAnother circumstance connected with my infancy, and I have done.  I need\noffer no apology for relating it, as it subsequently exercised\nconsiderable influence over my pursuits.  We were, if I remember right,\nin the vicinity of a place called Hythe, in Kent.  One sweet evening, in\nthe latter part of summer, our mother took her two little boys by the\nhand, for a wander about the fields.  In the course of our stroll we came\nto the village church; an old, gray-headed sexton stood in the porch,\nwho, perceiving that we were strangers, invited us to enter.  We were\npresently in the interior, wandering about the aisles, looking on the\nwalls, and inspecting the monuments of the notable dead.  I can scarcely\nstate what we saw; how should I?  I was a child not yet four years old,\nand yet I think I remember the evening sun streaming in through a stained\nwindow upon the dingy mahogany pulpit, and flinging a rich lustre upon\nthe faded tints of an ancient banner.  And now once more we were outside\nthe building, where, against the wall, stood a low-eaved pent-house, into\nwhich we looked.  It was half filled with substances of some kind, which\nat first looked like large gray stones.  The greater part were lying in\nlayers; some, however, were seen in confused and mouldering heaps, and\ntwo or three, which had perhaps rolled down from the rest, lay separately\non the floor.  'Skulls, madam,' said the sexton; 'skulls of the old\nDanes!  Long ago they came pirating into these parts; and then there\nchanced a mighty shipwreck, for God was angry with them, and He sunk\nthem; and their skulls, as they came ashore, were placed here as a\nmemorial.  There were many more when I was young, but now they are fast\ndisappearing.  Some of them must have belonged to strange fellows, madam.\nOnly see that one; why, the two young gentry can scarcely lift it!'  And,\nindeed, my brother and myself had entered the Golgotha, and commenced\nhandling these grim relics of mortality.  One enormous skull, lying in a\ncorner, had fixed our attention, and we had drawn it forth.  Spirit of\neld, what a skull was yon!\n\n{picture:'Skulls, madam,' said the sexton; 'skulls of the old Danes.':\npage18.jpg}\n\nI still seem to see it, the huge grim thing; many of the others were\nlarge, strikingly so, and appeared fully to justify the old man's\nconclusion that their owners must have been strange fellows; but,\ncompared with this mighty mass of bone, they looked small and diminutive\nlike those of pigmies; it must have belonged to a giant, one of those red-\nhaired warriors of whose strength and stature such wondrous tales are\ntold in the ancient chronicles of the north, and whose grave-hills, when\nransacked, occasionally reveal secrets which fill the minds of puny\nmoderns with astonishment and awe.  Reader, have you ever pored days and\nnights over the pages of Snorro?--probably not, for he wrote in a\nlanguage which few of the present day understand, and few would be\ntempted to read him tamed down by Latin dragomans.  A brave old book is\nthat of Snorro, containing the histories and adventures of old northern\nkings and champions, who seemed to have been quite different men, if we\nmay judge from the feats which they performed, from those of these days;\none of the best of his histories is that which describes the life of\nHarald Haardraade, who, after manifold adventures by land and sea, now a\npirate, now a mercenary of the Greek emperor, became king of Norway, and\neventually perished at the battle of Stamford Bridge, whilst engaged in a\ngallant onslaught upon England.  Now, I have often thought that the old\nKemp, whose mouldering skull in the Golgotha of Hythe my brother and\nmyself could scarcely lift, must have resembled in one respect at least\nthis Harald, whom Snorro describes as a great and wise ruler and a\ndetermined leader, dangerous in battle, of fair presence and measuring in\nheight just _five ells_, {19} neither more nor less.\n\nI never forgot the Daneman's skull; like the apparition of the viper in\nthe sandy lane, it dwelt in the mind of the boy, affording copious food\nfor the exercise of imagination.  From that moment with the name of Dane\nwere associated strange ideas of strength, daring, and superhuman\nstature; and an undefinable curiosity for all that is connected with the\nDanish race began to pervade me; and if, long after, when I became a\nstudent I devoted myself with peculiar zest to Danish lore and the\nacquirement of the old Norse tongue and its dialects, I can only explain\nthe matter by the early impression received at Hythe from the tale of the\nold sexton, beneath the pent-house, and the sight of the Danish skull.\n\nAnd thus we went on straying from place to place, at Hythe to-day, and\nperhaps within a week looking out from our hostel-window upon the streets\nof old Winchester, our motions ever in accordance with the 'route' of the\nregiment, so habituated to change of scene that it had become almost\nnecessary to our existence.  Pleasant were these days of my early\nboyhood; and a melancholy pleasure steals over me as I recall them.  Those\nwere stirring times of which I am speaking, and there was much passing\naround me calculated to captivate the imagination.  The dreadful struggle\nwhich so long convulsed Europe, and in which England bore so prominent a\npart, was then at its hottest; we were at war, and determination and\nenthusiasm shone in every face; man, woman, and child were eager to fight\nthe Frank, the hereditary, but, thank God, never dreaded enemy of the\nAnglo-Saxon race.  'Love your country and beat the French, and then never\nmind what happens,' was the cry of entire England.  Oh, those were days\nof power, gallant days, bustling days, worth the bravest days of chivalry\nat least; tall battalions of native warriors were marching through the\nland; there was the glitter of the bayonet and the gleam of the sabre;\nthe shrill squeak of the fife and loud rattling of the drum were heard in\nthe streets of country towns, and the loyal shouts of the inhabitants\ngreeted the soldiery on their arrival, or cheered them at their\ndeparture.  And now let us leave the upland, and descend to the sea-bord;\nthere is a sight for you upon the billows!  A dozen men-of-war are\ngliding majestically out of port, their long buntings streaming from the\ntop-gallant masts, calling on the skulking Frenchman to come forth from\nhis bights and bays; and what looms upon us yonder from the fog-bank in\nthe east? a gallant frigate towing behind her the long low hull of a\ncrippled privateer, which but three short days ago had left Dieppe to\nskim the sea, and whose crew of ferocious hearts are now cursing their\nimprudence in an English hold.  Stirring times those, which I love to\nrecall, for they were days of gallantry and enthusiasm, and were moreover\nthe days of my boyhood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\n\nPretty D-----The venerable church--The stricken heart--Dormant\nenergies--The small packet--Nerves--The books--A picture--Mountain-like\nbillows--The footprint--Spirit of De Foe--Reasoning powers--Terrors of\nGod--Heads of the dragons--High-Church clerk--A journey--The drowned\ncountry.\n\nAnd when I was between six and seven years of age we were once more at\nD---, the place of my birth, whither my father had been despatched on the\nrecruiting service.  I have already said that it was a beautiful little\ntown--at least it was at the time of which I am speaking--what it is at\npresent I know not, for thirty years and more have elapsed since I last\ntrod its streets.  It will scarcely have improved, for how could it be\nbetter than it then was?  I love to think on thee, pretty quiet D---,\nthou pattern of an English country town, with thy clean but narrow\nstreets branching out from thy modest market-place, with thine\nold-fashioned houses, with here and there a roof of venerable thatch,\nwith thy one half-aristocratic mansion, where resided thy Lady\nBountiful--she, the generous and kind, who loved to visit the sick,\nleaning on her gold-headed cane, whilst the sleek old footman walked at a\nrespectful distance behind.  Pretty quiet D---, with thy venerable\nchurch, in which moulder the mortal remains of England's sweetest and\nmost pious bard.\n\nYes, pretty D---, I could always love thee, were it but for the sake of\nhim who sleeps beneath the marble slab in yonder quiet chancel.  It was\nwithin thee that the long-oppressed bosom heaved its last sigh, and the\ncrushed and gentle spirit escaped from a world in which it had known\nnought but sorrow.  Sorrow! do I say?  How faint a word to express the\nmisery of that bruised reed; misery so dark that a blind worm like myself\nis occasionally tempted to exclaim, Better had the world never been\ncreated than that one so kind, so harmless, and so mild, should have\nundergone such intolerable woe!  But it is over now, for, as there is an\nend of joy, so has affliction its termination.  Doubtless the All-wise\ndid not afflict him without a cause: who knows but within that unhappy\nframe lurked vicious seeds which the sunbeams of joy and prosperity might\nhave called into life and vigour?  Perhaps the withering blasts of misery\nnipped that which otherwise might have terminated in fruit noxious and\nlamentable.  But peace to the unhappy one, he is gone to his rest; the\ndeath-like face is no longer occasionally seen timidly and mournfully\nlooking for a moment through the window-pane upon thy market-place, quiet\nand pretty D-; the hind in thy neighbourhood no longer at evening-fall\nviews, and starts as he views, the dark lathy figure moving beneath the\nhazels and alders of shadowy lanes, or by the side of murmuring trout\nstreams, and no longer at early dawn does the sexton of the old church\nreverently doff his hat, as, supported by some kind friend, the death-\nstricken creature totters along the church-path to that mouldering\nedifice with the low roof, inclosing a spring of sanatory waters, built\nand devoted to some saint, if the legend over the door be true, by the\ndaughter of an East Anglian king.\n\nBut to return to my own history.  I had now attained the age of six:\nshall I state what intellectual progress I had been making up to this\nperiod?  Alas! upon this point I have little to say calculated to afford\neither pleasure or edification; I had increased rapidly in size and in\nstrength: the growth of the mind, however, had by no means corresponded\nwith that of the body.  It is true, I had acquired my letters, and was by\nthis time able to read imperfectly; but this was all: and even this poor\ntriumph over absolute ignorance would never have been effected but for\nthe unremitting attention of my parents, who, sometimes by threats,\nsometimes by entreaties, endeavoured to rouse the dormant energies of my\nnature, and to bend my wishes to the acquisition of the rudiments of\nknowledge; but in influencing the wish lay the difficulty.  Let but the\nwill of a human being be turned to any particular object, and it is ten\nto one that sooner or later he achieves it.  At this time I may safely\nsay that I harboured neither wishes nor hopes; I had as yet seen no\nobject calculated to call them forth, and yet I took pleasure in many\nthings which perhaps unfortunately were all within my sphere of\nenjoyment.  I loved to look upon the heavens, and to bask in the rays of\nthe sun, or to sit beneath hedgerows and listen to the chirping of the\nbirds, indulging the while in musing and meditation as far as my very\nlimited circle of ideas would permit; but, unlike my brother, who was at\nthis time at school, and whose rapid progress in every branch of\ninstruction astonished and delighted his preceptors, I took no pleasure\nin books, whose use, indeed, I could scarcely comprehend, and bade fair\nto be as arrant a dunce as ever brought the blush of shame into the\ncheeks of anxious and affectionate parents.\n\nBut the time was now at hand when the ice which had hitherto bound the\nmind of the child with its benumbing power was to be thawed, and a world\nof sensations and ideas awakened to which it had hitherto been an entire\nstranger.  One day a young lady, an intimate acquaintance of our family,\nand godmother to my brother, drove up to the house in which we dwelt; she\nstayed some time conversing with my mother, and on rising to depart, she\nput down on the table a small packet, exclaiming, 'I have brought a\nlittle present for each of the boys: the one is a History of England,\nwhich I intend for my godson when he returns from school, the other is .\n. .'--and here she said something which escaped my ear, as I sat at some\ndistance, moping in a corner,--'I intend it for the youngster yonder,'\npointing to myself; she then departed, and, my mother going out shortly\nafter, I was left alone.\n\nI remember for some time sitting motionless in my corner, with my eyes\nbent upon the ground; at last I lifted my head and looked upon the packet\nas it lay on the table.  All at once a strange sensation came over me,\nsuch as I had never experienced before--a singular blending of curiosity,\nawe, and pleasure, the remembrance of which, even at this distance of\ntime, produces a remarkable effect upon my nervous system.  What strange\nthings are the nerves--I mean those more secret and mysterious ones in\nwhich I have some notion that the mind or soul, call it which you will,\nhas its habitation; how they occasionally tingle and vibrate before any\ncoming event closely connected with the future weal or woe of the human\nbeing.  Such a feeling was now within me, certainly independent of what\nthe eye had seen or the ear had heard.  A book of some description had\nbeen brought for me, a present by no means calculated to interest me;\nwhat cared I for books?  I had already many into which I never looked but\nfrom compulsion; friends, moreover, had presented me with similar things\nbefore, which I had entirely disregarded, and what was there in this\nparticular book, whose very title I did not know, calculated to attract\nme more than the rest? yet something within told me that my fate was\nconnected with the book which had been last brought; so, after looking on\nthe packet from my corner for a considerable time, I got up and went to\nthe table.\n\nThe packet was lying where it had been left--I took it up; had the\nenvelope, which consisted of whitish brown paper, been secured by a\nstring or a seal, I should not have opened it, as I should have\nconsidered such an act almost in the light of a crime; the books,\nhowever, had been merely folded up, and I therefore considered that there\ncould be no possible harm in inspecting them, more especially as I had\nreceived no injunction to the contrary.  Perhaps there was something\nunsound in this reasoning, something sophistical; but a child is\nsometimes as ready as a grown-up person in finding excuses for doing that\nwhich he is inclined to.  But whether the action was right or wrong, and\nI am afraid it was not altogether right, I undid the packet: it contained\nthree books; two from their similarity seemed to be separate parts of one\nand the same work; they were handsomely bound, and to them I first turned\nmy attention.  I opened them successively, and endeavoured to make out\ntheir meaning; their contents, however, as far as I was able to\nunderstand them, were by no means interesting: whoever pleases may read\nthese books for me, and keep them, too, into the bargain, said I to\nmyself.\n\nI now took up the third book: it did not resemble the others, being\nlonger and considerably thicker; the binding was of dingy calf-skin.  I\nopened it, and as I did so another strange thrill of pleasure shot\nthrough my frame.  The first object on which my eyes rested was a\npicture; it was exceedingly well executed, at least the scene which it\nrepresented made a vivid impression upon me, which would hardly have been\nthe case had the artist not been faithful to nature.  A wild scene it\nwas--a heavy sea and rocky shore, with mountains in the background, above\nwhich the moon was peering.  Not far from the shore, upon the water, was\na boat with two figures in it, one of which stood at the bow, pointing\nwith what I knew to be a gun at a dreadful shape in the water; fire was\nflashing from the muzzle of the gun, and the monster appeared to be\ntransfixed.  I almost thought I heard its cry.  I remained motionless,\ngazing upon the picture, scarcely daring to draw my breath, lest the new\nand wondrous world should vanish of which I had now obtained a glimpse.\n'Who are those people, and what could have brought them into that strange\nsituation?' I asked of myself; and now the seed of curiosity, which had\nso long lain dormant, began to expand, and I vowed to myself to become\nspeedily acquainted with the whole history of the people in the boat.\nAfter looking on the picture till every mark and line in it were familiar\nto me, I turned over various leaves till I came to another engraving; a\nnew source of wonder--a low sandy beach on which the furious sea was\nbreaking in mountain-like billows; cloud and rack deformed the firmament,\nwhich wore a dull and leaden-like hue; gulls and other aquatic fowls were\ntoppling upon the blast, or skimming over the tops of the maddening\nwaves--'Mercy upon him! he must be drowned!'  I exclaimed, as my eyes\nfell upon a poor wretch who appeared to be striving to reach the shore;\nhe was upon his legs, but was evidently half smothered with the brine;\nhigh above his head curled a horrible billow, as if to engulf him for\never.  'He must be drowned! he must be drowned!'  I almost shrieked, and\ndropped the book.  I soon snatched it up again, and now my eye lighted on\na third picture: again a shore, but what a sweet and lovely one, and how\nI wished to be treading it; there were beautiful shells lying on the\nsmooth white sand, some were empty like those I had occasionally seen on\nmarble mantelpieces, but out of others peered the heads and bodies of\nwondrous crayfish, a wood of thick green trees skirted the beach and\npartly shaded it from the rays of the sun, which shone hot above, while\nblue waves slightly crested with foam were gently curling against it;\nthere was a human figure upon the beach, wild and uncouth, clad in the\nskins of animals, with a huge cap on his head, a hatchet at his girdle,\nand in his hand a gun; his feet and legs were bare; he stood in an\nattitude of horror and surprise; his body was bent far back, and his\neyes, which seemed starting out of his head, were fixed upon a mark on\nthe sand--a large distinct mark--a human footprint. . . .\n\nReader, is it necessary to name the book which now stood open in my hand,\nand whose very prints, feeble expounders of its wondrous lines, had\nproduced within me emotions strange and novel?  Scarcely--for it was a\nbook which has exerted over the minds of Englishmen an influence\ncertainly greater than any other of modern times--which has been in most\npeople's hands, and with the contents of which even those who cannot read\nare to a certain extent acquainted--a book from which the most luxuriant\nand fertile of our modern prose writers have drunk inspiration--a book,\nmoreover, to which, from the hardy deeds which it narrates, and the\nspirit of strange and romantic enterprise which it tends to awaken,\nEngland owes many of her astonishing discoveries both by sea and land,\nand no inconsiderable part of her naval glory.\n\nHail to thee, spirit of De Foe!  What does not my own poor self owe to\nthee?  England has better bards than either Greece or Rome, yet I could\nspare them easier far than De Foe, 'unabashed De Foe,' as the hunchbacked\nrhymer styled him.\n\nThe true chord had now been touched; a raging curiosity with respect to\nthe contents of the volume, whose engravings had fascinated my eye,\nburned within me, and I never rested until I had fully satisfied it;\nweeks succeeded weeks, months followed months, and the wondrous volume\nwas my only study and principal source of amusement.  For hours together\nI would sit poring over a page till I had become acquainted with the\nimport of every line.  My progress, slow enough at first, became by\ndegrees more rapid, till at last, under 'a shoulder of mutton sail,' I\nfound myself cantering before a steady breeze over an ocean of\nenchantment, so well pleased with my voyage that I cared not how long it\nmight be ere it reached its termination.\n\nAnd it was in this manner that I first took to the paths of knowledge.\n\nAbout this time I began to be somewhat impressed with religious feelings.\nMy parents were, to a certain extent, religious people; but, though they\nhad done their best to afford me instruction on religious points, I had\neither paid no attention to what they endeavoured to communicate, or had\nlistened with an ear far too obtuse to derive any benefit.  But my mind\nhad now become awakened from the drowsy torpor in which it had lain so\nlong, and the reasoning powers which I possessed were no longer inactive.\nHitherto I had entertained no conception whatever of the nature and\nproperties of God, and with the most perfect indifference had heard the\ndivine name proceeding from the mouths of people--frequently, alas! on\noccasions when it ought not to be employed; but I now never heard it\nwithout a tremor, for I now knew that God was an awful and inscrutable\nBeing, the Maker of all things; that we were His children, and that we,\nby our sins, had justly offended Him; that we were in very great peril\nfrom His anger, not so much in this life as in another and far stranger\nstate of being yet to come; that we had a Saviour withal to whom it was\nnecessary to look for help: upon this point, however, I was yet very much\nin the dark, as, indeed, were most of those with whom I was connected.\nThe power and terrors of God were uppermost in my thoughts; they\nfascinated though they astounded me.  Twice every Sunday I was regularly\ntaken to the church, where, from a corner of the large spacious pew,\nlined with black leather, I would fix my eyes on the dignified\nHigh-Church rector, and the dignified High-Church clerk, and watch the\nmovement of their lips, from which, as they read their respective\nportions of the venerable liturgy, would roll many a portentous word\ndescriptive of the wondrous works of the Most High.\n\n_Rector_.  Thou didst divide the sea, through thy power: thou brakest the\nheads of the dragons in the waters.\n\n_Philoh_.  Thou smotest the heads of Leviathan in pieces: and gavest him\nto be meat for the people in the wilderness.\n\n_Rector_.  Thou broughtest out fountains, and waters out of the hard\nrocks: thou driedst up mighty waters.\n\n_Philoh_.  The day is thine, and the night is thine: thou hast prepared\nthe light and the sun.\n\nPeace to your memories, dignified rector, and yet more dignified\nclerk!--by this time ye are probably gone to your long homes, and your\nvoices are no longer heard sounding down the aisles of the venerable\nchurch--nay, doubtless, this has already long since been the fate of him\nof the sonorous 'Amen!'--the one of the two who, with all due respect to\nthe rector, principally engrossed my boyish admiration--he, at least, is\nscarcely now among the living! Living! why, I have heard say that he blew\na fife--for he was a musical as well as a Christian professor--a bold\nfife, to cheer the Guards and the brave Marines, as they marched with\nmeasured step, obeying an insane command, up Bunker's height, whilst the\nrifles of the sturdy Yankees were sending the leaden hail sharp and thick\namidst the red-coated ranks; for Philoh had not always been a man of\npeace, nor an exhorter to turn the other cheek to the smiter, but had\neven arrived at the dignity of a halberd in his country's service before\nhis six-foot form required rest, and the gray-haired veteran retired,\nafter a long peregrination, to his native town, to enjoy ease and\nrespectability on a pension of 'eighteenpence a day'; and well did his\nfellow-townsmen act, when, to increase that ease and respectability, and\nwith a thoughtful regard for the dignity of the good church service, they\nmade him clerk and precentor--the man of the tall form and of the audible\nvoice, which sounded loud and clear as his own Bunker fife.  Well, peace\nto thee, thou fine old chap, despiser of dissenters, and hater of\npapists, as became a dignified and High-Church clerk; if thou art in thy\ngrave, the better for thee; thou wert fitted to adorn a bygone time, when\nloyalty was in vogue, and smiling content lay like a sunbeam upon the\nland, but thou wouldst be sadly out of place in these days of cold\nphilosophic latitudinarian doctrine, universal tolerism, and\nhalf-concealed rebellion--rare times, no doubt, for papists and\ndissenters, but which would assuredly have broken the heart of the loyal\nsoldier of George the Third, and the dignified High-Church clerk of\npretty D---.\n\nWe passed many months at this place: nothing, however, occurred requiring\nany particular notice, relating to myself, beyond what I have already\nstated, and I am not writing the history of others.  At length my father\nwas recalled to his regiment, which at that time was stationed at a place\ncalled Norman Cross, in Lincolnshire, or rather Huntingdonshire, at some\ndistance from the old town of Peterborough.  For this place he departed,\nleaving my mother and myself to follow in a few days.  Our journey was a\nsingular one.  On the second day we reached a marshy and fenny country,\nwhich, owing to immense quantities of rain which had lately fallen, was\ncompletely submerged.  At a large town we got on board a kind of passage-\nboat, crowded with people; it had neither sails nor oars, and those were\nnot the days of steam-vessels; it was a treck-schuyt, and was drawn by\nhorses.  Young as I was, there was much connected with this journey which\nhighly surprised me, and which brought to my remembrance particular\nscenes described in the book which I now generally carried in my bosom.\nThe country was, as I have already said, submerged--entirely drowned--no\nland was visible; the trees were growing bolt upright in the flood,\nwhilst farmhouses and cottages were standing insulated; the horses which\ndrew us were up to the knees in water, and, on coming to blind pools and\n'greedy depths,' were not unfrequently swimming, in which case, the boys\nor urchins who mounted them sometimes stood, sometimes knelt, upon the\nsaddle and pillions.  No accident, however, occurred either to the\nquadrupeds or bipeds, who appeared respectively to be quite _au fait_ in\ntheir business, and extricated themselves with the greatest ease from\nplaces in which Pharaoh and all his host would have gone to the bottom.\nNightfall brought us to Peterborough, and from thence we were not slow in\nreaching the place of our destination.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\n\nNorman Cross--Wide expanse--_Vive l'Empereur_--Unpruned woods--Man with\nthe bag--Froth and conceit--I beg your pardon--Growing timid--About three\no'clock--Taking one's ease--Cheek on the ground--King of the\nvipers--French king--Frenchmen and water.\n\nAnd a strange place it was, this Norman Cross, and, at the time of which\nI am speaking, a sad cross to many a Norman, being what was then styled a\nFrench prison, that is, a receptacle for captives made in the French war.\nIt consisted, if I remember right, of some five or six casernes, very\nlong, and immensely high; each standing isolated from the rest, upon a\nspot of ground which might average ten acres, and which was fenced round\nwith lofty palisades, the whole being compassed about by a towering wall,\nbeneath which, at intervals, on both sides, sentinels were stationed,\nwhilst outside, upon the field, stood commodious wooden barracks, capable\nof containing two regiments of infantry, intended to serve as guards upon\nthe captives.  Such was the station or prison at Norman Cross, where some\nsix thousand French and other foreigners, followers of the grand\nCorsican, were now immured.\n\nWhat a strange appearance had those mighty casernes, with their blank\nblind walls, without windows or grating, and their slanting roofs, out of\nwhich, through orifices where the tiles had been removed, would be\nprotruded dozens of grim heads, feasting their prison-sick eyes on the\nwide expanse of country unfolded from that airy height.  Ah! there was\nmuch misery in those casernes; and from those roofs, doubtless, many a\nwistful look was turned in the direction of lovely France.  Much had the\npoor inmates to endure, and much to complain of, to the disgrace of\nEngland be it said--of England, in general so kind and bountiful.  Rations\nof carrion meat, and bread from which I have seen the very hounds\noccasionally turn away, were unworthy entertainment even for the most\nruffian enemy, when helpless and a captive; and such, alas! was the fare\nin those casernes.  And then, those visits, or rather ruthless inroads,\ncalled in the slang of the place 'strawplait-hunts,' when in pursuit of a\ncontraband article, which the prisoners, in order to procure themselves a\nfew of the necessaries and comforts of existence, were in the habit of\nmaking, red-coated battalions were marched into the prisons, who, with\nthe bayonet's point, carried havoc and ruin into every poor convenience\nwhich ingenious wretchedness had been endeavouring to raise around it;\nand then the triumphant exit with the miserable booty; and, worst of all,\nthe accursed bonfire, on the barrack parade, of the plait contraband,\nbeneath the view of the glaring eyeballs from those lofty roofs, amidst\nthe hurrahs of the troops, frequently drowned in the curses poured down\nfrom above like a tempest-shower or in the terrific warw-hoop of '_Vive\nl'Empereur_!'\n\nIt was midsummer when we arrived at this place, and the weather, which\nhad for a long time been wet and gloomy, now became bright and glorious;\nI was subjected to but little control, and passed my time pleasantly\nenough, principally in wandering about the neighbouring country.  It was\nflat and somewhat fenny, a district more of pasture than agriculture, and\nnot very thickly inhabited.  I soon became well acquainted with it.  At\nthe distance of two miles from the station was a large lake, styled in\nthe dialect of the country 'a mere,' about whose borders tall reeds were\ngrowing in abundance, this was a frequent haunt of mine; but my favourite\nplace of resort was a wild sequestered spot at a somewhat greater\ndistance.  Here, surrounded with woods and thick groves, was the seat of\nsome ancient family, deserted by the proprietor, and only inhabited by a\nrustic servant or two.  A place more solitary and wild could scarcely be\nimagined; the garden and walks were overgrown with weeds and briers, and\nthe unpruned woods were so tangled as to be almost impervious.  About\nthis domain I would wander till overtaken by fatigue, and then I would\nsit down with my back against some beech, elm, or stately alder tree,\nand, taking out my book, would pass hours in a state of unmixed\nenjoyment, my eyes now fixed on the wondrous pages, now glancing at the\nsylvan scene around; and sometimes I would drop the book and listen to\nthe voice of the rooks and wild pigeons, and not unfrequently to the\ncroaking of multitudes of frogs from the neighbouring swamps and fens.\n\n{picture:I frequently passed a tall elderly individual, dressed in rather\na quaint fashion: page31.jpg}\n\nIn going to and from this place I frequently passed a tall elderly\nindividual, dressed in rather a quaint fashion, with a skin cap on his\nhead and stout gaiters on his legs; on his shoulders hung a moderate\nsized leathern sack; he seemed fond of loitering near sunny banks, and of\ngroping amidst furze and low scrubby bramble bushes, of which there were\nplenty in the neighbourhood of Norman Cross.  Once I saw him standing in\nthe middle of a dusty road, looking intently at a large mark which seemed\nto have been drawn across it, as if by a walking stick.  'He must have\nbeen a large one,' the old man muttered half to himself, 'or he would not\nhave left such a trail, I wonder if he is near; he seems to have moved\nthis way.'  He then went behind some bushes which grew on the right side\nof the road, and appeared to be in quest of something, moving behind the\nbushes with his head downwards, and occasionally striking their roots\nwith his foot: at length he exclaimed, 'Here he is!' and forthwith I saw\nhim dart amongst the bushes.  There was a kind of scuffling noise, the\nrustling of branches, and the crackling of dry sticks.  'I have him!'\nsaid the man at last; 'I have got him!' and presently he made his\nappearance about twenty yards down the road, holding a large viper in his\nhand.  'What do you think of that, my boy?' said he, as I went up to\nhim--'what do you think of catching such a thing as that with the naked\nhand?'  'What do I think?' said I.  'Why, that I could do as much\nmyself.'  'You do,' said the man, 'do you?  Lord! how the young people in\nthese days are given to conceit; it did not use to be so in my time: when\nI was a child, childer knew how to behave themselves; but the childer of\nthese days are full of conceit, full of froth, like the mouth of this\nviper'; and with his forefinger and thumb he squeezed a considerable\nquantity of foam from the jaws of the viper down upon the road.  'The\nchilder of these days are a generation of--God forgive me, what was I\nabout to say?' said the old man; and opening his bag he thrust the\nreptile into it, which appeared far from empty.  I passed on.  As I was\nreturning, towards the evening, I overtook the old man, who was wending\nin the same direction.  'Good evening to you, sir,' said I, taking off a\ncap which I wore on my head.  'Good evening,' said the old man; and then,\nlooking at me, 'How's this?' said he, 'you aren't, sure, the child I met\nin the morning?'  'Yes,' said I, 'I am; what makes you doubt it?'  'Why,\nyou were then all froth and conceit,' said the old man, 'and now you take\noff your cap to me.'  'I beg your pardon,' said I, 'if I was frothy and\nconceited; it ill becomes a child like me to be so.'  'That's true,\ndear,' said the old man; 'well, as you have begged my pardon, I truly\nforgive you.'  'Thank you,' said I; 'have you caught any more of those\nthings?'  'Only four or five,' said the old man; 'they are getting\nscarce, though this used to be a great neighbourhood for them.'  'And\nwhat do you do with them?' said I; 'do you carry them home and play with\nthem?'  'I sometimes play with one or two that I tame,' said the old man;\n'but I hunt them mostly for the fat which they contain, out of which I\nmake unguents which are good for various sore troubles, especially for\nthe rheumatism.'  'And do you get your living by hunting these\ncreatures?' I demanded.  'Not altogether,' said the old man; 'besides\nbeing a viper-hunter, I am what they call a herbalist, one who knows the\nvirtue of particular herbs; I gather them at the proper season, to make\nmedicines with for the sick.'  'And do you live in the neighbourhood?' I\ndemanded.  'You seem very fond of asking questions, child.  No, I do not\nlive in this neighbourhood in particular, I travel about; I have not been\nin this neighbourhood till lately for some years.'\n\nFrom this time the old man and myself formed an acquaintance; I often\naccompanied him in his wanderings about the neighbourhood, and, on two or\nthree occasions, assisted him in catching the reptiles which he hunted.\nHe generally carried a viper with him which he had made quite tame, and\nfrom which he had extracted the poisonous fangs; it would dance and\nperform various kinds of tricks.  He was fond of telling me anecdotes\nconnected with his adventures with the reptile species.  'But,' said he\none day, sighing, 'I must shortly give up this business, I am no longer\nthe man I was, I am become timid, and when a person is timid in viper-\nhunting, he had better leave off, as it is quite clear his virtue is\nleaving him.  I got a fright some years ago, which I am quite sure I\nshall never get the better of; my hand has been shaky more or less ever\nsince.'  'What frightened you?' said I.  'I had better not tell you,'\nsaid the old man, 'or you may be frightened too, lose your virtue, and be\nno longer good for the business.'  'I don't care,' said I; 'I don't\nintend to follow the business: I daresay I shall be an officer, like my\nfather.'  'Well,' said the old man, 'I once saw the king of the vipers,\nand since then--'  'The king of the vipers!' said I, interrupting him;\n'have the vipers a king?'  'As sure as we have,' said the old man--'as\nsure as we have King George to rule over us, have these reptiles a king\nto rule over them.'  'And where did you see him?' said I.  'I will tell\nyou,' said the old man, 'though I don't like talking about the matter.  It\nmay be about seven years ago that I happened to be far down yonder to the\nwest, on the other side of England, nearly two hundred miles from here,\nfollowing my business.  It was a very sultry day, I remember, and I had\nbeen out several hours catching creatures.  It might be about three\no'clock in the afternoon, when I found myself on some heathy land near\nthe sea, on the ridge of a hill, the side of which, nearly as far down as\nthe sea, was heath; but on the top there was arable ground, which had\nbeen planted, and from which the harvest had been gathered--oats or\nbarley, I know not which--but I remember that the ground was covered with\nstubble.  Well, about three o'clock, as I told you before, what with the\nheat of the day and from having walked about for hours in a lazy way, I\nfelt very tired; so I determined to have a sleep, and I laid myself down,\nmy head just on the ridge of the hill, towards the field, and my body\nover the side down amongst the heath; my bag, which was nearly filled\nwith creatures, lay at a little distance from my face; the creatures were\nstruggling in it, I remember, and I thought to myself, how much more\ncomfortably off I was than they; I was taking my ease on the nice open\nhill, cooled with the breezes, whilst they were in the nasty close bag,\ncoiling about one another, and breaking their very hearts, all to no\npurpose: and I felt quite comfortable and happy in the thought, and\nlittle by little closed my eyes, and fell into the sweetest snooze that\never I was in in all my life; and there I lay over the hill's side, with\nmy head half in the field, I don't know how long, all dead asleep.  At\nlast it seemed to me that I heard a noise in my sleep, something like a\nthing moving, very faint, however, far away; then it died, and then it\ncame again upon my ear as I slept, and now it appeared almost as if I\nheard crackle, crackle; then it died again, or I became yet more dead\nasleep than before, I know not which, but I certainly lay some time\nwithout hearing it.  All of a sudden I became awake, and there was I, on\nthe ridge of the hill, with my cheek on the ground towards the stubble,\nwith a noise in my ear like that of something moving towards me amongst\nthe stubble of the field; well, I lay a moment or two listening to the\nnoise, and then I became frightened, for I did not like the noise at all,\nit sounded so odd; so I rolled myself on my belly, and looked towards the\nstubble.  Mercy upon us! there was a huge snake, or rather a dreadful\nviper, for it was all yellow and gold, moving towards me, bearing its\nhead about a foot and a half above the ground, the dry stubble crackling\nbeneath its outrageous belly.  It might be about five yards off when I\nfirst saw it, making straight towards me, child, as if it would devour\nme.  I lay quite still, for I was stupefied with horror, whilst the\ncreature came still nearer; and now it was nearly upon me, when it\nsuddenly drew back a little, and then--what do you think?--it lifted its\nhead and chest high in the air, and high over my face as I looked up,\nflickering at me with its tongue as if it would fly at my face.  Child,\nwhat I felt at that moment I can scarcely say, but it was a sufficient\npunishment for all the sins I ever committed; and there we two were, I\nlooking up at the viper, and the viper looking down upon me, flickering\nat me with its tongue.  It was only the kindness of God that saved me:\nall at once there was a loud noise, the report of a gun, for a fowler was\nshooting at a covey of birds, a little way off in the stubble.  Whereupon\nthe viper sunk its head, and immediately made off over the ridge of the\nhill, down in the direction of the sea.  As it passed by me, however--and\nit passed close by me--it hesitated a moment, as if it was doubtful\nwhether it should not seize me; it did not, however, but made off down\nthe hill.  It has often struck me that he was angry with me, and came\nupon me unawares for presuming to meddle with his people, as I have\nalways been in the habit of doing.'\n\n'But,' said I, 'how do you know that it was the king of the vipers?'\n\n'How do I know!' said the old man, 'who else should it be?  There was as\nmuch difference between it and other reptiles as between King George and\nother people.'\n\n'Is King George, then, different from other people?' I demanded.\n\n'Of course,' said the old man; 'I have never seen him myself, but I have\nheard people say that he is a ten times greater man than other folks;\nindeed, it stands to reason that he must be different from the rest, else\npeople would not be so eager to see him.  Do you think, child, that\npeople would be fools enough to run a matter of twenty or thirty miles to\nsee the king, provided King George--'\n\n'Haven't the French a king?' I demanded.\n\n'Yes,' said the old man, 'or something much the same, and a queer one he\nis; not quite so big as King George, they say, but quite as terrible a\nfellow.  What of him?'\n\n'Suppose he should come to Norman Cross!'\n\n'What should he do at Norman Cross, child?'\n\n'Why, you were talking about the vipers in your bag breaking their\nhearts, and so on, and their king coming to help them.  Now, suppose the\nFrench king should hear of his people being in trouble at Norman Cross,\nand--'\n\n'He can't come, child,' said the old man, rubbing his hands, 'the water\nlies between.  The French don't like the water; neither vipers nor\nFrenchmen take kindly to the water, child.'\n\n{picture:'There we two were, I looking up at the viper, and the viper\nlooking down upon me, flickering at me with its tongue.': page36.jpg}\n\nWhen the old man left the country, which he did a few days after the\nconversation which I have just related, he left me the reptile which he\nhad tamed and rendered quite harmless by removing the fangs.  I was in\nthe habit of feeding it with milk, and frequently carried it abroad with\nme in my walks.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\nThe tent--Man and woman--Dark and swarthy--Manner of speaking--Bad\nmoney--Transfixed--Faltering tone--Little basket--High opinion--Plenty of\ngood--Keeping guard--Tilted cart--Rubricals--Jasper--The right sort--The\nhorseman of the lane--John Newton--The alarm--Gentle brothers.\n\nOne day it happened that, being on my rambles, I entered a green lane\nwhich I had never seen before; at first it was rather narrow, but as I\nadvanced it became considerably wider; in the middle was a driftway with\ndeep ruts, but right and left was a space carpeted with a sward of\ntrefoil and clover; there was no lack of trees, chiefly ancient oaks,\nwhich, flinging out their arms from either side, nearly formed a canopy,\nand afforded a pleasing shelter from the rays of the sun, which was\nburning fiercely above.  Suddenly a group of objects attracted my\nattention.  Beneath one of the largest of the trees, upon the grass, was\na kind of low tent or booth, from the top of which a thin smoke was\ncurling; beside it stood a couple of light carts, whilst two or three\nlean horses or ponies were cropping the herbage which was growing nigh.\nWondering to whom this odd tent could belong, I advanced till I was close\nbefore it, when I found that it consisted of two tilts, like those of\nwaggons, placed upon the ground and fronting each other, connected behind\nby a sail or large piece of canvas which was but partially drawn across\nthe top; upon the ground, in the intervening space, was a fire, over\nwhich, supported by a kind of iron crowbar, hung a caldron; my advance\nhad been so noiseless as not to alarm the inmates, who consisted of a man\nand woman, who sat apart, one on each side of the fire; they were both\nbusily employed--the man was carding plaited straw, whilst the woman\nseemed to be rubbing something with a white powder, some of which lay on\na plate beside her; suddenly the man looked up, and, perceiving me,\nuttered a strange kind of cry, and the next moment both the woman and\nhimself were on their feet and rushing out upon me.\n\nI retreated a few steps, yet without turning to flee.  I was not,\nhowever, without apprehension, which, indeed, the appearance of these two\npeople was well calculated to inspire: the woman was a stout figure,\nseemingly between thirty and forty; she wore no cap, and her long hair\nfell on either side of her head like horse-tails half-way down her waist;\nher skin was dark and swarthy, like that of a toad, and the expression of\nher countenance was particularly evil; her arms were bare, and her bosom\nwas but half concealed by a slight bodice, below which she wore a coarse\npetticoat, her only other article of dress.  The man was somewhat\nyounger, but of a figure equally wild; his frame was long and lathy, but\nhis arms were remarkably short, his neck was rather bent, he squinted\nslightly, and his mouth was much awry; his complexion was dark, but,\nunlike that of the woman, was more ruddy than livid; there was a deep\nscar on his cheek, something like the impression of a halfpenny.  The\ndress was quite in keeping with the figure: in his hat, which was\nslightly peaked, was stuck a peacock's feather; over a waistcoat of hide,\nuntanned and with the hair upon it, he wore a rough jerkin of russet hue;\nsmallclothes of leather, which had probably once belonged to a soldier,\nbut with which pipeclay did not seem to have come in contact for many a\nyear, protected his lower man as far as the knee; his legs were cased in\nlong stockings of blue worsted, and on his shoes he wore immense\nold-fashioned buckles.\n\nSuch were the two beings who now came rushing upon me; the man was rather\nin advance, brandishing a ladle in his hand.\n\n'So I have caught you at last,' said he; 'I'll teach ye, you young\nhighwayman, to come skulking about my properties!'\n\nYoung as I was, I remarked that his manner of speaking was different from\nthat of any people with whom I had been in the habit of associating.  It\nwas quite as strange as his appearance, and yet it nothing resembled the\nforeign English which I had been in the habit of hearing through the\npalisades of the prison; he could scarcely be a foreigner.\n\n'Your properties!' said I; 'I am in the King's Lane.  Why did you put\nthem there, if you did not wish them to be seen?'\n\n'On the spy,' said the woman, 'hey?  I'll drown him in the sludge in the\ntoad-pond over the hedge.'\n\n'So we will,' said the man, 'drown him anon in the mud!'\n\n'Drown me, will you?' said I; 'I should like to see you!  What's all this\nabout?  Was it because I saw you with your hands full of straw plait, and\nmy mother there--'\n\n'Yes,' said the woman; 'what was I about?'\n\n_Myself_.  How should I know?  Making bad money, perhaps!\n\nAnd it will be as well here to observe, that at this time there was much\nbad money in circulation in the neighbourhood, generally supposed to be\nfabricated by the prisoners, so that this false coin and straw plait\nformed the standard subjects of conversation at Norman Cross.\n\n'I'll strangle thee,' said the beldame, dashing at me.  'Bad money, is\nit?'\n\n'Leave him to me, wifelkin,' said the man, interposing; 'you shall now\nsee how I'll baste him down the lane.'\n\n_Myself_.  I tell you what, my chap, you had better put down that thing\nof yours; my father lies concealed within my tepid breast, and if to me\nyou offer any harm or wrong, I'll call him forth to help me with his\nforked tongue.\n\n_Man_.  What do you mean, ye Bengui's bantling?  I never heard such\ndiscourse in all my life: playman's speech or Frenchman's talk--which, I\nwonder?  Your father!  Tell the mumping villain that if he comes near my\nfire I'll serve him out as I will you.  Take that-- Tiny Jesus! what have\nwe got here?  Oh, delicate Jesus! what is the matter with the child?\n\n{picture:'Tiny Jesus! what have we got here?  Oh, delicate Jesus! what is\nthe matter with the child?': page40.jpg}\n\nI had made a motion which the viper understood; and now, partly\ndisengaging itself from my bosom, where it had lain perdu, it raised its\nhead to a level with my face, and stared upon my enemy with its\nglittering eyes.\n\nThe man stood like one transfixed, and the ladle, with which he had aimed\na blow at me, now hung in the air like the hand which held it; his mouth\nwas extended, and his cheeks became of a pale yellow, save alone that\nplace which bore the mark which I have already described, and this shone\nnow portentously, like fire.  He stood in this manner for some time; at\nlast the ladle fell from his hand, and its falling appeared to rouse him\nfrom his stupor.\n\n'I say, wifelkin,' said he, in a faltering tone, 'did you ever see the\nlike of this here?'\n\nBut the woman had retreated to the tent, from the entrance of which her\nloathly face was now thrust, with an expression partly of terror and\npartly of curiosity.  After gazing some time longer at the viper and\nmyself, the man stooped down and took up the ladle; then, as if somewhat\nmore assured, he moved to the tent, where he entered into conversation\nwith the beldame in a low voice.  Of their discourse, though I could hear\nthe greater part of it, I understood not a single word; and I wondered\nwhat it could be, for I knew by the sound that it was not French.  At\nlast the man, in a somewhat louder tone, appeared to put a question to\nthe woman, who nodded her head affirmatively, and in a moment or two\nproduced a small stool, which she delivered to him.  He placed it on the\nground, close by the door of the tent, first rubbing it with his sleeve,\nas if for the purpose of polishing its surface.\n\n_Man_.  Now, my precious little gentleman, do sit down here by the poor\npeople's tent; we wish to be civil in our slight way.  Don't be angry,\nand say no; but look kindly upon us, and satisfied, my precious little\nGod Almighty.\n\n_Woman_.  Yes, my gorgeous angel, sit down by the poor bodies' fire, and\neat a sweetmeat.  We want to ask you a question or two; only first put\nthat serpent away.\n\n_Myself_.  I can sit down, and bid the serpent go to sleep, that's easy\nenough; but as for eating a sweetmeat, how can I do that?  I have not got\none, and where am I to get it?\n\n_Woman_.  Never fear, my tiny tawny, we can give you one, such as you\nnever ate, I daresay, however far you may have come from.\n\nThe serpent sank into its usual resting-place, and I sat down on the\nstool.  The woman opened a box, and took out a strange little basket or\nhamper, not much larger than a man's fist, and formed of a delicate kind\nof matting.  It was sewed at the top; but, ripping it open with a knife,\nshe held it to me, and I saw, to my surprise, that it contained candied\nfruits of a dark green hue, tempting enough to one of my age.  'There, my\ntiny,' said she; 'taste, and tell me how you like them.'\n\n'Very much,' said I; 'where did you get them?'\n\nThe beldame leered upon me for a moment, then, nodding her head thrice,\nwith a knowing look, said, 'Who knows better than yourself, my tawny?'\n\nNow, I knew nothing about the matter; but I saw that these strange people\nhad conceived a very high opinion of the abilities of their visitor,\nwhich I was nothing loth to encourage.  I therefore answered boldly, 'Ah!\nwho indeed!'\n\n'Certainly,' said the man; 'who should know better than yourself, or so\nwell?  And now, my tiny one, let me ask you one thing--you didn't come to\ndo us any harm?'\n\n'No,' said I, 'I had no dislike to you; though, if you were to meddle\nwith me--'\n\n_Man_.  Of course, my gorgeous, of course you would; and quite right too.\nMeddle with you!--what right have we?  I should say, it would not be\nquite safe.  I see how it is; you are one of them there;--and he bent his\nhead towards his left shoulder.\n\n_Myself_.  Yes, I am one of them--for I thought he was alluding to the\nsoldiers,--you had best mind what you are about, I can tell you.\n\n_Man_.  Don't doubt we will for our own sake; Lord bless you, wifelkin,\nonly think that we should see one of them there when we least thought\nabout it.  Well, I have heard of such things, though I never thought to\nsee one; however, seeing is believing.  Well! now you are come, and are\nnot going to do us any mischief, I hope you will stay; you can do us\nplenty of good if you will.\n\n_Myself_.  What good could I do you?\n\n_Man_.  What good? plenty!  Would you not bring us luck?  I have heard\nsay that one of them there always does, if it will but settle down.  Stay\nwith us, you shall have a tilted cart all to yourself if you like.  We'll\nmake you our little God Almighty, and say our prayers to you every\nmorning!\n\n_Myself_.  That would be nice; and, if you were to give me plenty of\nthese things, I should have no objection.  But what would my father say?\nI think he would hardly let me.\n\n_Man_.  Why not? he would be with you; and kindly would we treat him.\nIndeed, without your father you would be nothing at all.\n\n_Myself_.  That's true; but I do not think he could be spared from his\nregiment.  I have heard him say that they could do nothing without him.\n\n_Man_.  His regiment!  What are you talking about?--what does the child\nmean?\n\n_Myself_.  What do I mean!--why, that my father is an officer-man at the\nbarracks yonder, keeping guard over the French prisoners.\n\n_Man_.  Oh! then that sap is not your father?\n\n_Myself_.  What, the snake?  Why, no!  Did you think he was?\n\n_Man_.  To be sure we did.  Didn't you tell me so?\n\n_Myself_.  Why, yes; but who would have thought you would have believed\nit?  It is a tame one.  I hunt vipers, and tame them.\n\n_Man_.  O-h!\n\n'O-h!' grunted the woman, 'that's it, is it?'\n\nThe man and woman, who during this conversation had resumed their former\npositions within the tent, looked at each other with a queer look of\nsurprise, as if somewhat disconcerted at what they now heard.  They then\nentered into discourse with each other in the same strange tongue which\nhad already puzzled me.  At length the man looked me in the face, and\nsaid, somewhat hesitatingly, 'So you are not one of them there after\nall?'\n\n_Myself_.  One of them there?  I don't know what you mean.\n\n_Man_.  Why, we have been thinking you were a goblin--a devilkin!\nHowever, I see how it is: you are a sap-engro, a chap who catches snakes,\nand plays tricks with them!  Well, it comes very nearly to the same\nthing; and if you please to list with us, and bear us pleasant company,\nwe shall be glad of you.  I'd take my oath upon it, that we might make a\nmort of money by you and that sap, and the tricks it could do; and, as\nyou seem fly to everything, I shouldn't wonder if you would make a prime\nhand at telling fortunes.\n\n'I shouldn't wonder,' said I.\n\n_Man_.  Of course.  And you might still be our God Almighty, or at any\nrate our clergyman, so you should live in a tilted cart by yourself, and\nsay prayers to us night and morning--to wifelkin here, and all our\nfamily; there's plenty of us when we are all together: as I said before,\nyou seem fly, I shouldn't wonder if you could read?\n\n'Oh yes!' said I, 'I can read'; and, eager to display my accomplishments,\nI took my book out of my pocket, and, opening it at random, proceeded to\nread how a certain man, whilst wandering about a certain solitary island,\nentered a cave, the mouth of which was overgrown with brushwood, and how\nhe was nearly frightened to death in that cave by something which he saw.\n\n'That will do,' said the man; 'that's the kind of prayers for me and my\nfamily, aren't they, wifelkin?  I never heard more delicate prayers in\nall my life!  Why, they beat the rubricals hollow!--and here comes my son\nJasper.  I say, Jasper, here's a young sap-engro that can read, and is\nmore fly than yourself.  Shake hands with him; I wish ye to be two\nbrothers.'\n\nWith a swift but stealthy pace Jasper came towards us from the farther\npart of the lane; on reaching the tent he stood still, and looked fixedly\nupon me as I sat upon the stool; I looked fixedly upon him.  A queer look\nhad Jasper; he was a lad of some twelve or thirteen years, with long\narms, unlike the singular being who called himself his father; his\ncomplexion was ruddy, but his face was seamed, though it did not bear the\npeculiar scar which disfigured the countenance of the other; nor, though\nroguish enough, a certain evil expression which that of the other bore,\nand which the face of the woman possessed in a yet more remarkable\ndegree.  For the rest, he wore drab breeches, with certain strings at the\nknee, a rather gay waistcoat, and tolerably white shirt; under his arm he\nbore a mighty whip of whalebone with a brass knob, and upon his head was\na hat without either top or brim.\n\n'There, Jasper! shake hands with the sap-engro.'\n\n'Can he box, father?' said Jasper, surveying me rather contemptuously.  'I\nshould think not, he looks so puny and small.'\n\n'Hold your peace, fool!' said the man; 'he can do more than that--I tell\nyou he's fly: he carries a sap about, which would sting a ninny like you\nto dead.'\n\n'What, a sap-engro!' said the boy, with a singular whine, and, stooping\ndown, he leered curiously in my face, kindly, however, and then patted me\non the head.  'A sap-engro,' he ejaculated; 'lor!'\n\n'Yes, and one of the right sort,' said the man; 'I am glad we have met\nwith him, he is going to list with us, and be our clergyman and God\nAlmighty, ain't you, my tawny?'\n\n'I don't know,' said I; 'I must see what my father will say.'\n\n'Your father; bah!'--but here he stopped, for a sound was heard like the\nrapid galloping of a horse, not loud and distinct as on a road, but dull\nand heavy as if upon a grass sward; nearer and nearer it came, and the\nman, starting up, rushed out of the tent, and looked around anxiously.  I\narose from the stool upon which I had been seated, and just at that\nmoment, amidst a crashing of boughs and sticks, a man on horseback\nbounded over the hedge into the lane at a few yards' distance from where\nwe were: from the impetus of the leap the horse was nearly down on his\nknees; the rider, however, by dint of vigorous handling of the reins,\nprevented him from falling, and then rode up to the tent.  ''Tis Nat,'\nsaid the man; 'what brings him here?'  The new-comer was a stout burly\nfellow, about the middle age; he had a savage determined look, and his\nface was nearly covered over with carbuncles; he wore a broad slouching\nhat, and was dressed in a gray coat, cut in a fashion which I afterwards\nlearnt to be the genuine Newmarket cut, the skirts being exceedingly\nshort; his waistcoat was of red plush, and he wore broad corduroy\nbreeches and white top-boots.  The steed which carried him was of iron\ngray, spirited and powerful, but covered with sweat and foam.  The fellow\nglanced fiercely and suspiciously around, and said something to the man\nof the tent in a harsh and rapid voice.  A short and hurried conversation\nensued in the strange tongue.  I could not take my eyes off this\nnew-comer.  Oh, that half-jockey, half-bruiser countenance, I never\nforgot it!  More than fifteen years afterwards I found myself amidst a\ncrowd before Newgate; a gallows was erected, and beneath it stood a\ncriminal, a notorious malefactor.  I recognised him at once; the horseman\nof the lane is now beneath the fatal tree, but nothing altered; still the\nsame man; jerking his head to the right and left with the same fierce and\nunder glance, just as if the affairs of this world had the same kind of\ninterest to the last; gray coat of Newmarket cut, plush waistcoat,\ncorduroys, and boots, nothing altered; but the head, alas! is bare, and\nso is the neck.  Oh, crime and virtue, virtue and crime!--it was old John\nNewton, I think, who, when he saw a man going to be hanged, said, 'There\ngoes John Newton, but for the grace of God!'\n\nBut the lane, the lane, all was now in confusion in the lane; the man and\nwoman were employed in striking the tents and in making hurried\npreparations for departure; the boy Jasper was putting the harness upon\nthe ponies and attaching them to the carts; and, to increase the\nsingularity of the scene, two or three wild-looking women and girls, in\nred cloaks and immense black beaver bonnets, came from I know not what\ndirection, and, after exchanging a few words with the others, commenced\nwith fierce and agitated gestures to assist them in their occupation.  The\nrider meanwhile sat upon his horse, but evidently in a state of great\nimpatience; he muttered curses between his teeth, spurred the animal\nfuriously, and then reined it in, causing it to rear itself up nearly\nperpendicular.  At last he said, 'Curse ye for Romans, how slow ye are!\nwell, it is no business of mine, stay here all day if you like; I have\ngiven ye warning, I am off to the big north road.  However, before I go,\nyou had better give me all you have of that.'\n\n'Truly spoken, Nat, my pal,' said the man; 'give it him, mother.  There\nit is; now be off as soon as you please, and rid us of evil company.'\n\nThe woman had handed him two bags formed of stocking, half full of\nsomething heavy, which looked through them for all the world like money\nof some kind.  The fellow, on receiving them, thrust them without\nceremony into the pockets of his coat, and then, without a word of\nfarewell salutation, departed at a tremendous rate, the hoofs of his\nhorse thundering for a long time on the hard soil of the neighbouring\nroad, till the sound finally died away in the distance.  The strange\npeople were not slow in completing their preparations, and then, flogging\ntheir animals terrifically, hurried away seemingly in the same direction.\n\nThe boy Jasper was last of the band.  As he was following the rest, he\nstopped suddenly, and looked on the ground appearing to muse; then,\nturning round, he came up to me where I was standing, leered in my face,\nand then, thrusting out his hand, he said, 'Good-bye, Sap, I daresay we\nshall meet again, remember we are brothers; two gentle brothers.'\n\nThen whining forth, 'What a sap-engro, lor!' he gave me a parting leer,\nand hastened away.\n\nI remained standing in the lane gazing after the retreating company.  'A\nstrange set of people,' said I at last; 'wonder who they can be?'\n\n{picture:Then whining forth, 'What a sap-engro, lor!' he gave me a\nparting leer, and hastened away: page47.jpg}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\nThree years--Lilly's grammar--Proficiency--Ignorant of figures--The\nschool bell--Order of succession--Persecution--What are we to\ndo?--Northward--A goodly scene--Haunted ground--Feats of\nchivalry--Rivers--Over the brig.\n\nYears passed on, even three years; during this period I had increased\nconsiderably in stature and in strength, and, let us hope, improved in\nmind; for I had entered on the study of the Latin language.  The very\nfirst person to whose care I was intrusted for the acquisition of Latin\nwas an old friend of my fathers, a clergyman who kept a seminary at a\ntown the very next we visited after our departure from 'the Cross.'  Under\nhis instruction, however, I continued only a few weeks, as we speedily\nleft the place.  'Captain,' said this divine, when my father came to take\nleave of him on the eve of our departure, 'I have a friendship for you,\nand therefore wish to give you a piece of advice concerning this son of\nyours.  You are now removing him from my care; you do wrong, but we will\nlet that pass.  Listen to me: there is but one good school-book in the\nworld--the one I use in my seminary--Lilly's Latin grammar, in which your\nson has already made some progress.  If you are anxious for the success\nof your son in life, for the correctness of his conduct and the soundness\nof his principles, keep him to Lilly's grammar.  If you can by any means,\neither fair or foul, induce him to get by heart Lilly's Latin grammar,\nyou may set your heart at rest with respect to him; I, myself, will be\nhis warrant.  I never yet knew a boy that was induced, either by fair\nmeans or foul, to learn Lilly's Latin grammar by heart, who did not turn\nout a man, provided he lived long enough.'\n\nMy father, who did not understand the classical languages, received with\nrespect the advice of his old friend, and from that moment conceived the\nhighest opinion of Lilly's Latin grammar.  During three years I studied\nLilly's Latin grammar under the tuition of various schoolmasters, for I\ntravelled with the regiment, and in every town in which we were\nstationary I was invariably (God bless my father!) sent to the classical\nacademy of the place.  It chanced, by good fortune, that in the\ngenerality of these schools the grammar of Lilly was in use; when,\nhowever, that was not the case, it made no difference in my educational\ncourse, my father always stipulating with the masters that I should be\ndaily examined in Lilly.  At the end of the three years I had the whole\nby heart; you had only to repeat the first two or three words of any\nsentence in any part of the book, and forthwith I would open cry,\ncommencing without blundering and hesitation, and continue till you were\nglad to beg me to leave off, with many expressions of admiration at my\nproficiency in the Latin language.  Sometimes, however, to convince you\nhow well I merited these encomiums, I would follow you to the bottom of\nthe stair, and even into the street, repeating in a kind of sing-song\nmeasure the sonorous lines of the golden schoolmaster.  If I am here\nasked whether I understood anything of what I had got by heart, I\nreply--'Never mind, I understand it all now, and believe that no one ever\nyet got Lilly's Latin grammar by heart when young, who repented of the\nfeat at a mature age.'\n\nAnd, when my father saw that I had accomplished my task, he opened his\nmouth, and said, 'Truly, this is more than I expected.  I did not think\nthat there had been so much in you, either of application or capacity;\nyou have now learnt all that is necessary, if my friend Dr. B---'s\nopinion was sterling, as I have no doubt it was.  You are still a child,\nhowever, and must yet go to school, in order that you may be kept out of\nevil company.  Perhaps you may still contrive, now you have exhausted the\nbarn, to pick up a grain or two in the barn-yard.  You are still ignorant\nof figures, I believe, not that I would mention figures in the same day\nwith Lilly's grammar.'\n\nThese words were uttered in a place called ---, in the north, or in the\nroad to the north, to which, for some time past, our corps had been\nslowly advancing.  I was sent to the school of the place, which chanced\nto be a day school.  It was a somewhat extraordinary one, and a somewhat\nextraordinary event occurred to me within its walls.\n\nIt occupied part of the farther end of a small plain, or square, at the\noutskirts of the town, close to some extensive bleaching fields.  It was\na long low building of one room, with no upper story; on the top was a\nkind of wooden box, or sconce, which I at first mistook for a\npigeon-house, but which in reality contained a bell, to which was\nattached a rope, which, passing through the ceiling, hung dangling in the\nmiddle of the school-room.  I am the more particular in mentioning this\nappurtenance, as I had soon occasion to scrape acquaintance with it in a\nmanner not very agreeable to my feelings.  The master was very proud of\nhis bell, if I might judge from the fact of his eyes being frequently\nturned to that part of the ceiling from which the rope depended.  Twice\nevery day, namely, after the morning and evening tasks had been gone\nthrough, were the boys rung out of school by the monotonous jingle of\nthis bell.  This ringing out was rather a lengthy affair, for, as the\nmaster was a man of order and method, the boys were only permitted to go\nout of the room one by one; and as they were rather numerous, amounting,\nat least, to one hundred, and were taught to move at a pace of suitable\ndecorum, at least a quarter of an hour elapsed from the commencement of\nthe march before the last boy could make his exit.  The office of bell-\nringer was performed by every boy successively; and it so happened that,\nthe very first day of my attendance at the school, the turn to ring the\nbell had, by order of succession, arrived at the place which had been\nallotted to me; for the master, as I have already observed, was a man of\nmethod and order, and every boy had a particular seat, to which he became\na fixture as long as he continued at the school.\n\nSo, upon this day, when the tasks were done and completed, and the boys\nsat with their hats and caps in their hands, anxiously expecting the\nmoment of dismissal, it was suddenly notified to me, by the urchins who\nsat nearest to me, that I must get up and ring the bell.  Now, as this\nwas the first time that I had been at the school, I was totally\nunacquainted with the process, which I had never seen, and, indeed, had\nnever heard of till that moment.  I therefore sat still, not imagining it\npossible that any such duty could be required of me.  But now, with not a\nlittle confusion, I perceived that the eyes of all the boys in the school\nwere fixed upon me.  Presently there were nods and winks in the direction\nof the bell-rope; and, as these produced no effect, uncouth visages were\nmade, like those of monkeys when enraged; teeth were gnashed, tongues\nthrust out, and even fists were bent at me.  The master, who stood at the\nend of the room, with a huge ferule under his arm, bent full upon me a\nlook of stern appeal; and the ushers, of whom there were four, glared\nupon me, each from his own particular corner, as I vainly turned, in one\ndirection and another, in search of one reassuring look.\n\nBut now, probably in obedience to a sign from the master, the boys in my\nimmediate neighbourhood began to maltreat me. Some pinched me with their\nfingers, some buffeted me, whilst others pricked me with pins, or the\npoints of compasses.  These arguments were not without effect.  I sprang\nfrom my seat, and endeavoured to escape along a double line of benches,\nthronged with boys of all ages, from the urchin of six or seven to the\nnondescript of sixteen or seventeen.  It was like running the gauntlet;\nevery one, great or small, pinching, kicking, or otherwise maltreating\nme, as I passed by.\n\nGoaded on in this manner, I at length reached the middle of the room,\nwhere dangled the bell-rope, the cause of all my sufferings.  I should\nhave passed it--for my confusion was so great that I was quite at a loss\nto comprehend what all this could mean, and almost believed myself under\nthe influence of an ugly dream--but now the boys, who were seated in\nadvance in the row, arose with one accord, and barred my farther\nprogress; and one, doubtless more sensible than the rest, seizing the\nrope, thrust it into my hand.  I now began to perceive that the dismissal\nof the school, and my own release from torment, depended upon this\nselfsame rope.  I therefore, in a fit of desperation, pulled it once or\ntwice, and then left off, naturally supposing that I had done quite\nenough.  The boys who sat next the door no sooner heard the bell, than,\nrising from their seats, they moved out at the door.  The bell, however,\nhad no sooner ceased to jingle, than they stopped short, and, turning\nround, stared at the master, as much as to say, 'What are we to do now?'\nThis was too much for the patience of the man of method, which my\nprevious stupidity had already nearly exhausted.  Dashing forward into\nthe middle of the room, he struck me violently on the shoulders with his\nferule, and, snatching the rope out of my hand, exclaimed, with a\nstentorian voice, and genuine Yorkshire accent, 'Prodigy of ignorance!\ndost not even know how to ring a bell?  Must I myself instruct thee?'  He\nthen commenced pulling at the bell with such violence that long before\nhalf the school was dismissed the rope broke, and the rest of the boys\nhad to depart without their accustomed music.\n\nBut I must not linger here, though I could say much about the school and\nthe pedagogue highly amusing and diverting, which, however, I suppress,\nin order to make way for matters of yet greater interest.  On we went,\nnorthward, northward! and, as we advanced, I saw that the country was\nbecoming widely different from those parts of merry England in which we\nhad previously travelled.  It was wilder, and less cultivated, and more\nbroken with hills and hillocks.  The people, too, of these regions\nappeared to partake of something of the character of their country.  They\nwere coarsely dressed; tall and sturdy of frame; their voices were deep\nand guttural; and the half of the dialect which they spoke was\nunintelligible to my ears.\n\nI often wondered where we could be going, for I was at this time about as\nignorant of geography as I was of most other things.  However, I held my\npeace, asked no questions, and patiently awaited the issue.\n\nNorthward, northward, still!  And it came to pass that, one morning, I\nfound myself extended on the bank of a river.  It was a beautiful morning\nof early spring; small white clouds were floating in the heaven,\noccasionally veiling the countenance of the sun, whose light, as they\nretired, would again burst forth, coursing like a race-horse over the\nscene--and a goodly scene it was!  Before me, across the water, on an\neminence, stood a white old city, surrounded with lofty walls, above\nwhich rose the tops of tall houses, with here and there a church or\nsteeple.  To my right hand was a long and massive bridge, with many\narches, and of antique architecture, which traversed the river.  The\nriver was a noble one; the broadest that I had hitherto seen.  Its\nwaters, of a greenish tinge, poured with impetuosity beneath the narrow\narches to meet the sea, close at hand, as the boom of the billows\nbreaking distinctly upon a beach declared.  There were songs upon the\nriver from the fisher-barks; and occasionally a chorus, plaintive and\nwild, such as I had never heard before, the words of which I did not\nunderstand, but which, at the present time, down the long avenue of\nyears, seem in memory's ear to sound like 'Horam, coram, dago.'  Several\nrobust fellows were near me, some knee-deep in water, employed in hauling\nthe seine upon the strand.  Huge fish were struggling amidst the\nmeshes--princely salmon,--their brilliant mail of blue and silver\nflashing in the morning beam; so goodly and gay a scene, in truth, had\nnever greeted my boyish eye.\n\nAnd, as I gazed upon the prospect, my bosom began to heave, and my tears\nto trickle.  Was it the beauty of the scene which gave rise to these\nemotions?  Possibly; for though a poor ignorant child--a half-wild\ncreature--I was not insensible to the loveliness of nature, and took\npleasure in the happiness and handiworks of my fellow-creatures.  Yet,\nperhaps, in something more deep and mysterious the feelings which then\npervaded me might originate.  Who can lie down on Elvir Hill without\nexperiencing something of the sorcery of the place?  Flee from Elvir\nHill, young swain, or the maids of Elle will have power over you, and you\nwill go elf-wild!--so say the Danes.  I had unconsciously laid myself\ndown upon haunted ground; and I am willing to imagine that what I then\nexperienced was rather connected with the world of spirits and dreams\nthan with what I actually saw and heard around me.  Surely the elves and\ngenii of the place were conversing, by some inscrutable means, with the\nprinciple of intelligence lurking within the poor uncultivated clod!\nPerhaps to that ethereal principle the wonders of the past, as connected\nwith that stream, the glories of the present, and even the history of the\nfuture, were at that moment being revealed!  Of how many feats of\nchivalry had those old walls been witness, when hostile kings contended\nfor their possession!--how many an army from the south and from the north\nhad trod that old bridge!--what red and noble blood had crimsoned those\nrushing waters!-what strains had been sung, ay, were yet being sung, on\nits banks!--some soft as Doric reed; some fierce and sharp as those of\nNorwegian Skaldaglam; some as replete with wild and wizard force as\nFinland's runes, singing of Kalevala's moors, and the deeds of\nWoinomoinen!  Honour to thee, thou island stream!  Onward may thou ever\nroll, fresh and green, rejoicing in thy bright past, thy glorious\npresent, and in vivid hope of a triumphant future!  Flow on, beautiful\none!--which of the world's streams canst thou envy, with thy beauty and\nrenown?  Stately is the Danube, rolling in its might through lands\nromantic with the wild exploits of Turk, Polak, and Magyar!  Lovely is\nthe Rhine! on its shelvy banks grows the racy grape; and strange old\nkeeps of robber-knights of yore are reflected in its waters, from\npicturesque crags and airy headlands!--yet neither the stately Danube nor\nthe beauteous Rhine, with all their fame, though abundant, needst thou\nenvy, thou pure island stream!--and far less yon turbid river of old, not\nmodern renown, gurgling beneath the walls of what was once proud Rome,\ntowering Rome, Jupiter's town, but now vile Rome, crumbling Rome,\nBatuscha's town, far less needst thou envy the turbid Tiber of bygone\nfame, creeping sadly to the sea, surcharged with the abominations of\nmodern Rome--how unlike to thee, thou pure island stream!\n\nAnd, as I lay on the bank and wept, there drew nigh to me a man in the\nhabiliments of a fisher.  He was bare-legged, of a weather-beaten\ncountenance, and of stature approaching to the gigantic.  'What is the\ncallant greeting for?' said he, as he stopped and surveyed me.  'Has\nonybody wrought ye ony harm?'\n\n'Not that I know of,' I replied, rather guessing at than understanding\nhis question; 'I was crying because I could not help it!  I say, old one,\nwhat is the name of this river?'\n\n'Hout!  I now see what you was greeting at--at your ain ignorance, nae\ndoubt--'tis very great!  Weel, I will na fash you with reproaches, but\neven enlighten ye, since you seem a decent man's bairn, and you speir a\ncivil question.  Yon river is called the Tweed; and yonder, over the\nbrig, is Scotland.  Did ye never hear of the Tweed, my bonny man?'\n\n'No,' said I, as I rose from the grass, and proceeded to cross the bridge\nto the town at which we had arrived the preceding night; 'I never heard\nof it; but now I have seen it, I shall not soon forget it!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\nThe Castle--A father's inquiries--Scotch language--A determination--Bui\nhin Digri--Good Scotchman--Difference of races--Ne'er a haggis--Pugnacious\npeople--Wha are ye, man?--The Nor Loch--Gestures wild--The bicker--New\nTown champion--Wild-looking figure--Headlong.\n\nIt was not long before we found ourselves at Edinburgh, or rather in the\nCastle, into which the regiment marched with drums beating, colours\nflying, and a long train of baggage-waggons behind.  The Castle was, as I\nsuppose it is now, a garrison for soldiers.  Two other regiments were\nalready there; the one an Irish, if I remember right, the other a small\nHighland corps.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to say much about this Castle, which everybody has\nseen; on which account, doubtless, nobody has ever yet thought fit to\ndescribe it--at least that I am aware.  Be this as it may, I have no\nintention of describing it, and shall content myself with observing that\nwe took up our abode in that immense building, or caserne, of modern\nerection, which occupies the entire eastern side of the bold rock on\nwhich the Castle stands.  A gallant caserne it was--the best and roomiest\nthat I had hitherto seen--rather cold and windy, it is true, especially\nin the winter, but commanding a noble prospect of a range of distant\nhills, which I was told were 'the hieland hills,' and of a broad arm of\nthe sea, which I heard somebody say was the Firth of Forth.\n\nMy brother, who, for some years past, had been receiving his education in\na certain celebrated school in England, was now with us; and it came to\npass, that one day my father, as he sat at table, looked steadfastly on\nmy brother and myself, and then addressed my mother:--'During my journey\ndown hither, I have lost no opportunity of making inquiries about these\npeople, the Scotch, amongst whom we now are, and since I have been here I\nhave observed them attentively.  From what I have heard and seen, I\nshould say that upon the whole they are a very decent set of people; they\nseem acute and intelligent, and I am told that their system of education\nis so excellent that every person is learned--more or less acquainted\nwith Greek and Latin.  There is one thing, however, connected with them,\nwhich is a great drawback--the horrid jargon which they speak.  However\nlearned they may be in Greek and Latin, their English is execrable; and\nyet I'm told it is not so bad as it was.  I was in company, the other\nday, with an Englishman who has resided here many years.  We were talking\nabout the country and the people.  \"I should like both very well,\" said\nI, \"were it not for the language.  I wish sincerely our Parliament, which\nis passing so many foolish acts every year, would pass one to force these\nScotch to speak English.\"  \"I wish so, too,\" said he.  \"The language is a\ndisgrace to the British Government; but, if you had heard it twenty years\nago, captain!--if you had heard it as it was spoken when I first came to\nEdinburgh!\"'\n\n'Only custom,' said my mother.  'I daresay the language is now what it\nwas then.'\n\n'I don't know,' said my father; 'though I daresay you are right; it could\nnever have been worse than it is at present.  But now to the point.  Were\nit not for the language, which, if the boys were to pick it up, might\nruin their prospects in life,--were it not for that, I should very much\nlike to send them to a school there is in this place, which everybody\ntalks about--the High School I think they call it.  'Tis said to be the\nbest school in the whole island; but the idea of one's children speaking\nScotch--broad Scotch!  I must think the matter over.'\n\nAnd he did think the matter over; and the result of his deliberation was\na determination to send us to the school.  Let me call thee up before my\nmind's eye, High School, to which, every morning, the two English\nbrothers took their way from the proud old Castle through the lofty\nstreets of the Old Town.  High School!--called so, I scarcely know why;\nneither lofty in thyself nor by position, being situated in a flat\nbottom; oblong structure of tawny stone, with many windows fenced with\niron netting--with thy long hall below, and thy five chambers above, for\nthe reception of the five classes, into which the eight hundred urchins\nwho styled thee instructress were divided.  Thy learned rector and his\nfour subordinate dominies; thy strange old porter of the tall form and\ngrizzled hair, hight Boee, and doubtless of Norse ancestry, as his name\ndeclares; perhaps of the blood of Bui hin Digri, the hero of northern\nsong--the Jomsborg Viking who clove Thorsteinn Midlangr asunder in the\ndread sea battle of Horunga Vog, and who, when the fight was lost and his\nown two hands smitten off, seized two chests of gold with his bloody\nstumps, and, springing with them into the sea, cried to the scanty relics\nof his crew, 'Overboard now, all Bui's lads!'  Yes, I remember all about\nthee, and how at eight of every morn we were all gathered together with\none accord in the long hall, from which, after the litanies had been read\n(for so I will call them, being an Episcopalian), the five classes from\nthe five sets of benches trotted off in long files, one boy after the\nother, up the five spiral staircases of stone, each class to its\ndestination; and well do I remember how we of the third sat hushed and\nstill, watched by the eye of the dux, until the door opened, and in\nwalked that model of a good Scotchman, the shrewd, intelligent, but warm-\nhearted and kind dominie, the respectable Carson.\n\nAnd in this school I began to construe the Latin language, which I had\nnever done before, notwithstanding my long and diligent study of Lilly,\nwhich illustrious grammar was not used at Edinburgh, nor indeed known.\nGreek was only taught in the fifth or highest class, in which my brother\nwas; as for myself, I never got beyond the third during the two years\nthat I remained at this seminary.  I certainly acquired here a\nconsiderable insight in the Latin tongue; and, to the scandal of my\nfather and horror of my mother, a thorough proficiency in the Scotch,\nwhich, in less than two months, usurped the place of the English, and so\nobstinately maintained its ground, that I still can occasionally detect\nits lingering remains.  I did not spend my time unpleasantly at this\nschool, though, first of all, I had to pass through an ordeal.\n\n'Scotland is a better country than England,' said an ugly, blear-eyed\nlad, about a head and shoulders taller than myself, the leader of a gang\nof varlets who surrounded me in the playground, on the first day, as soon\nas the morning lesson was over.  'Scotland is a far better country than\nEngland, in every respect.'\n\n'Is it?' said I.  'Then you ought to be very thankful for not having been\nborn in England.'\n\n'That's just what I am, ye loon; and every morning, when I say my\nprayers, I thank God for not being an Englishman.  The Scotch are a much\nbetter and braver people than the English.'\n\n'It may be so,' said I, 'for what I know--indeed, till I came here, I\nnever heard a word either about the Scotch or their country.'\n\n'Are ye making fun of us, ye English puppy?' said the blear-eyed lad;\n'take that!' and I was presently beaten black and blue.  And thus did I\nfirst become aware of the difference of races and their antipathy to each\nother.\n\n'Bow to the storm, and it shall pass over you.'  I held my peace, and\nsilently submitted to the superiority of the Scotch--_in numbers_.  This\nwas enough; from an object of persecution I soon became one of patronage,\nespecially amongst the champions of the class.  'The English,' said the\nblear-eyed lad, 'though a wee bit behind the Scotch in strength and\nfortitude, are nae to be sneezed at, being far ahead of the Irish, to say\nnothing of the French, a pack of cowardly scoundrels.  And with regard to\nthe English country, it is na Scotland, it is true, but it has its gude\nproperties; and, though there is ne'er a haggis in a' the land, there's\nan unco deal o' gowd and siller.  I respect England, for I have an auntie\nmarried there.'\n\nThe Scotch are certainly a most pugnacious people; their whole history\nproves it.  Witness their incessant wars with the English in the olden\ntime, and their internal feuds, highland and lowland, clan with clan,\nfamily with family, Saxon with Gael.  In my time, the schoolboys, for\nwant, perhaps, of English urchins to contend with, were continually\nfighting with each other; every noon there was at least one pugilistic\nencounter, and sometimes three.  In one month I witnessed more of these\nencounters than I had ever previously seen under similar circumstances in\nEngland.  After all, there was not much harm done.  Harm! what harm could\nresult from short chopping blows, a hug, and a tumble?  I was witness to\nmany a sounding whack, some blood shed, 'a blue ee' now and then, but\nnothing more.  In England, on the contrary, where the lads were\ncomparatively mild, gentle, and pacific, I had been present at more than\none death caused by blows in boyish combats, in which the oldest of the\nvictors had scarcely reached thirteen years; but these blows were in the\njugular, given with the full force of the arm shot out horizontally from\nthe shoulder.\n\nBut the Scotch--though by no means proficients in boxing (and how should\nthey box, seeing that they have never had a teacher?)--are, I repeat, a\nmost pugnacious people; at least they were in my time.  Anything served\nthem, that is, the urchins, as a pretence for a fray, or, Dorically\nspeaking, a _bicker_; every street and close was at feud with its\nneighbour; the lads of the school were at feud with the young men of the\ncollege, whom they pelted in winter with snow, and in summer with stones;\nand then the feud between the old and new town!\n\nOne day I was standing on the ramparts of the Castle on the south-western\nside which overhangs the green brae, where it slopes down into what was\nin those days the green swamp or morass, called by the natives of Auld\nReekie the Nor Loch; it was a dark gloomy day, and a thin veil of mist\nwas beginning to settle down upon the brae and the morass.  I could\nperceive, however, that there was a skirmish taking place in the latter\nspot.  I had an indistinct view of two parties--apparently of urchins--and\nI heard whoops and shrill cries: eager to know the cause of this\ndisturbance, I left the Castle, and descending the brae reached the\nborders of the morass, where were a runnel of water and the remains of an\nold wall, on the other side of which a narrow path led across the swamp:\nupon this path at a little distance before me there was 'a bicker.'  I\npushed forward, but had scarcely crossed the ruined wall and runnel, when\nthe party nearest to me gave way, and in great confusion came running in\nmy direction.  As they drew nigh, one of them shouted to me, 'Wha are ye,\nman? are ye o' the Auld Toon?'  I made no answer.  'Ha! ye are o' the New\nToon; De'il tak ye, we'll moorder ye'; and the next moment a huge stone\nsung past my head.  'Let me be, ye fule bodies,' said I, 'I'm no of\neither of ye, I live yonder aboon in the Castle.'  'Ah! ye live in the\nCastle; then ye're an auld tooner; come gie us your help, man, and dinna\nstand there staring like a dunnot, we want help sair eneugh.  Here are\nstanes.'\n\nFor my own part I wished for nothing better, and, rushing forward, I\nplaced myself at the head of my new associates, and commenced flinging\nstones fast and desperately.  The other party now gave way in their turn,\nclosely followed by ourselves; I was in the van, and about to stretch out\nmy hand to seize the hindermost boy of the enemy, when, not being\nacquainted with the miry and difficult paths of the Nor Loch, and in my\neagerness taking no heed of my footing, I plunged into a quagmire, into\nwhich I sank as far as my shoulders.  Our adversaries no sooner perceived\nthis disaster, than, setting up a shout, they wheeled round and attacked\nus most vehemently.  Had my comrades now deserted me, my life had not\nbeen worth a straw's purchase, I should either have been smothered in the\nquag, or, what is more probable, had my brains beaten out with stones;\nbut they behaved like true Scots, and fought stoutly around their\ncomrade, until I was extricated, whereupon both parties retired, the\nnight being near at hand.\n\n'Ye are na a bad hand at flinging stanes,' said the lad who first\naddressed me, as we now returned up the brae; 'your aim is right\ndangerous, mon, I saw how ye skelpit them, ye maun help us agin thae New\nToon blackguards at our next bicker.'\n\nSo to the next bicker I went, and to many more, which speedily followed\nas the summer advanced; the party to which I had given my help on the\nfirst occasion consisted merely of outlyers, posted about half-way up the\nhill, for the purpose of overlooking the movements of the enemy.\n\nDid the latter draw nigh in any considerable force, messengers were\nforthwith despatched to the 'Auld Toon,' especially to the filthy alleys\nand closes of the High Street, which forthwith would disgorge swarms of\nbare-headed and bare-footed 'callants,' who, with gestures wild and\n'eldrich screech and hollo,' might frequently be seen pouring down the\nsides of the hill.  I have seen upwards of a thousand engaged on either\nside in these frays, which I have no doubt were full as desperate as the\nfights described in the _Iliad_, and which were certainly much more\nbloody than the combats of modern Greece in the war of independence: the\ncallants not only employed their hands in hurling stones, but not\nunfrequently slings; at the use of which they were very expert, and which\noccasionally dislodged teeth, shattered jaws, or knocked out an eye.  Our\nopponents certainly laboured under considerable disadvantage, being\ncompelled not only to wade across a deceitful bog, but likewise to\nclamber up part of a steep hill, before they could attack us;\nnevertheless, their determination was such, and such their impetuosity,\nthat we had sometimes difficulty enough to maintain our own.  I shall\nnever forget one bicker, the last indeed which occurred at that time, as\nthe authorities of the town, alarmed by the desperation of its character,\nstationed forthwith a body of police on the hill-side, to prevent, in\nfuture, any such breaches of the peace.\n\nIt was a beautiful Sunday evening, the rays of the descending sun were\nreflected redly from the gray walls of the Castle, and from the black\nrocks on which it was founded.  The bicker had long since commenced,\nstones from sling and hand were flying; but the callants of the New Town\nwere now carrying everything before them.\n\nA full-grown baker's apprentice was at their head; he was foaming with\nrage, and had taken the field, as I was told, in order to avenge his\nbrother, whose eye had been knocked out in one of the late bickers.  He\nwas no slinger or flinger, but brandished in his right hand the spoke of\na cart-wheel, like my countryman Tom Hickathrift of old in his encounter\nwith the giant of the Lincolnshire fen.  Protected by a piece of wicker-\nwork attached to his left arm, he rushed on to the fray, disregarding the\nstones which were showered against him, and was ably seconded by his\nfollowers.  Our own party was chased half-way up the hill, where I was\nstruck to the ground by the baker, after having been foiled in an attempt\nwhich I had made to fling a handful of earth into his eyes.  All now\nappeared lost, the Auld Toon was in full retreat.  I myself lay at the\nbaker's feet, who had just raised his spoke, probably to give me the\n_coup de grace_,--it was an awful moment.  Just then I heard a shout and\na rushing sound; a wild-looking figure is descending the hill with\nterrible bounds; it is a lad of some fifteen years; he is bare-headed,\nand his red uncombed hair stands on end like hedgehogs' bristles: his\nframe is lithy, like that of an antelope, but he has prodigious breadth\nof chest; he wears a military undress, that of the regiment, even of a\ndrummer, for it is wild Davy, whom a month before I had seen enlisted on\nLeith Links to serve King George with drum and drumstick as long as his\nservices might be required, and who, ere a week had elapsed, had smitten\nwith his fist Drum-Major Elzigood, who, incensed at his inaptitude, had\nthreatened him with his cane; he has been in confinement for weeks, this\nis the first day of his liberation, and he is now descending the hill\nwith horrid bounds and shoutings; he is now about five yards distant, and\nthe baker, who apprehends that something dangerous is at hand, prepares\nhimself for the encounter; but what avails the strength of a baker, even\nfull grown?--what avails the defence of a wicker shield?--what avails the\nwheel-spoke, should there be an opportunity of using it, against the\nimpetus of an avalanche or a cannon-ball?--for to either of these might\nthat wild figure be compared, which, at the distance of five yards,\nsprang at once with head, hands, feet and body, all together, upon the\nchampion of the New Town, tumbling him to the earth amain.  And now it\nwas the turn of the Old Town to triumph.  Our late discomfited host,\nreturning on its steps, overwhelmed the fallen champion with blows of\nevery kind, and then, led on by his vanquisher, who had assumed his arms,\nnamely, the wheel-spoke and wicker shield, fairly cleared the brae of\ntheir adversaries, whom they drove down headlong into the morass.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\nExpert climbers--The crags--Something red--The horrible edge--David\nHaggart--Fine materials--The greatest victory--Extraordinary robber--The\nruling passion.\n\nMeanwhile I had become a daring cragsman, a character to which an English\nlad has seldom opportunities of aspiring; for in England there are\nneither crags nor mountains.  Of these, however, as is well known, there\nis no lack in Scotland, and the habits of individuals are invariably in\nharmony with the country in which they dwell.  The Scotch are expert\nclimbers, and I was now a Scot in most things, particularly in language.\nThe Castle in which I dwelt stood upon a rock, a bold and craggy one,\nwhich, at first sight, would seem to bid defiance to any feet save those\nof goats and chamois; but patience and perseverance generally enable\nmankind to overcome things which, at first sight, appear impossible.\nIndeed, what is there above man's exertions?  Unwearied determination\nwill enable him to run with the horse, to swim with the fish, and\nassuredly to compete with the chamois and the goat in agility and\nsureness of foot.  To scale the rock was merely child's play for the\nEdinbro' callants.  It was my own favourite diversion.  I soon found that\nthe rock contained all manner of strange crypts, crannies, and recesses,\nwhere owls nestled, and the weasel brought forth her young; here and\nthere were small natural platforms, overgrown with long grass and various\nkinds of plants, where the climber, if so disposed, could stretch\nhimself, and either give his eyes to sleep or his mind to thought; for\ncapital places were these same platforms either for repose or meditation.\nThe boldest features of the rock are descried on the northern side,\nwhere, after shelving down gently from the wall for some distance, it\nterminates abruptly in a precipice, black and horrible, of some three\nhundred feet at least, as if the axe of nature had been here employed\ncutting sheer down, and leaving behind neither excrescence nor spur--a\ndizzy precipice it is, assimilating much to those so frequent in the\nflinty hills of Northern Africa, and exhibiting some distant resemblance\nto that of Gibraltar, towering in its horridness above the Neutral\nGround.\n\nIt was now holiday time, and having nothing particular wherewith to\noccupy myself, I not unfrequently passed the greater part of the day upon\nthe rocks.  Once, after scaling the western crags, and creeping round a\nsharp angle of the wall, overhung by a kind of watch-tower, I found\nmyself on the northern side.  Still keeping close to the wall, I was\nproceeding onward, for I was bent upon a long excursion which should\nembrace half the circuit of the Castle, when suddenly my eye was\nattracted by the appearance of something red, far below me; I stopped\nshort, and, looking fixedly upon it, perceived that it was a human being\nin a kind of red jacket, seated on the extreme verge of the precipice\nwhich I have already made a faint attempt to describe.  Wondering who it\ncould be, I shouted; but it took not the slightest notice, remaining as\nimmovable as the rock on which it sat.  'I should never have thought of\ngoing near that edge,' said I to myself; 'however, as you have done it,\nwhy should not I?  And I should like to know who you are.'  So I\ncommenced the descent of the rock, but with great care, for I had as yet\nnever been in a situation so dangerous; a slight moisture exuded from the\npalms of my hands, my nerves were tingling, and my brain was somewhat\ndizzy--and now I had arrived within a few yards of the figure, and had\nrecognised it: it was the wild drummer who had turned the tide of battle\nin the bicker on the Castle Brae.  A small stone which I dislodged now\nrolled down the rock, and tumbled into the abyss close beside him.  He\nturned his head, and after looking at me for a moment somewhat vacantly,\nhe resumed his former attitude.  I drew yet nearer to the horrible edge\nnot close, however, for fear was on me.\n\n'What are you thinking of, David?' said I, as I sat behind him and\ntrembled, for I repeat that I was afraid.\n\n_David Haggart_.  I was thinking of Willie Wallace.\n\n_Myself_.  You had better be thinking of yourself, man.  A strange place\nthis to come to and think of William Wallace.\n\n_David Haggart_.  Why so?  Is not his tower just beneath our feet?\n\n_Myself_.  You mean the auld ruin by the side of the Nor Loch--the ugly\nstane bulk, from the foot of which flows the spring into the dyke where\nthe watercresses grow?\n\n_David Haggart_.  Just sae, Geordie.\n\n_Myself_.  And why were ye thinking of him?  The English hanged him long\nsince, as I have heard say.\n\n_David Haggart_.  I was thinking that I should wish to be like him.\n\n_Myself_.  Do ye mean that ye would wish to be hanged?\n\n_David Haggart_.  I wadna flinch from that, Geordie, if I might be a\ngreat man first.\n\n_Myself_.  And wha kens, Davie, how great you may be, even without\nhanging?  Are ye not in the high road of preferment?  Are ye not a bauld\ndrummer already?  Wha kens how high ye may rise? perhaps to be general,\nor drum-major.\n\n_David Haggart_.  I hae nae wish to be drum-major; it were nae great\nthings to be like the doited carle, Else-than-gude, as they call him;\nand, troth, he has nae his name for naething.  But I should have nae\nobjection to be a general, and to fight the French and Americans, and win\nmyself a name and a fame like Willie Wallace, and do brave deeds, such as\nI have been reading about in his story book.\n\n_Myself_.  Ye are a fule, Davie; the story book is full of lies.  Wallace,\nindeed! the wuddie rebel!  I have heard my father say that the Duke of\nCumberland was worth twenty of Willie Wallace.\n\n_David Haggart_.  Ye had better sae naething agin Willie Wallace,\nGeordie, for, if ye do, De'il hae me, if I dinna tumble ye doon the\ncraig.\n\nFine materials in that lad for a hero, you will say.  Yes, indeed, for a\nhero, or for what he afterwards became.  In other times, and under other\ncircumstances, he might have made what is generally termed a great man, a\npatriot, or a conqueror.  As it was, the very qualities which might then\nhave pushed him on to fortune and renown were the cause of his ruin.  The\nwar over, he fell into evil courses; for his wild heart and ambitious\nspirit could not brook the sober and quiet pursuits of honest industry.\n\n'Can an Arabian steed submit to be a vile drudge?' I cries the fatalist.\nNonsense!  A man is not an irrational creature, but a reasoning being,\nand has something within him beyond mere brutal instinct.  The greatest\nvictory which a man can achieve is over himself, by which is meant those\nunruly passions which are not convenient to the time and place.  David\ndid not do this; he gave the reins to his wild heart, instead of curbing\nit, and became a robber, and, alas! alas! he shed blood--under peculiar\ncircumstances, it is true, and without _malice prepense_--and for that\nblood he eventually died, and justly; for it was that of the warden of a\nprison from which he was escaping, and whom he slew with one blow of his\nstalwart arm.\n\nTamerlane and Haggart!  Haggart and Tamerlane!  Both these men were\nrobbers, and of low birth, yet one perished on an ignoble scaffold, and\nthe other died emperor of the world.  Is this justice?  The ends of the\ntwo men were widely dissimilar--yet what is the intrinsic difference\nbetween them?  Very great indeed; the one acted according to his lights\nand his country, not so the other.  Tamerlane was a heathen, and acted\naccording to his lights; he was a robber where all around were robbers,\nbut he became the avenger of God--God's scourge on unjust kings, on the\ncruel Bajazet, who had plucked out his own brothers' eyes; he became to a\ncertain extent the purifier of the East, its regenerator; his equal never\nwas before, nor has it since been seen.  Here the wild heart was\nprofitably employed, the wild strength, the teeming brain.  Onward, Lame\none!  Onward, Tamur--lank!  Haggart . . . .\n\nBut peace to thee, poor David! why should a mortal worm be sitting in\njudgment over thee?  The Mighty and Just One has already judged thee, and\nperhaps above thou hast received pardon for thy crimes, which could not\nbe pardoned here below; and now that thy feverish existence has closed,\nand thy once active form become inanimate dust, thy very memory all but\nforgotten, I will say a few words about thee, a few words soon also to be\nforgotten.  Thou wast the most extraordinary robber that ever lived\nwithin the belt of Britain; Scotland rang with thy exploits, and England,\ntoo, north of the Humber; strange deeds also didst thou achieve when,\nfleeing from justice, thou didst find thyself in the Sister Isle; busy\nwast thou there in town and on curragh, at fair and race-course, and also\nin the solitary place.  Ireland thought thee her child, for who spoke her\nbrogue better than thyself?--she felt proud of thee, and said, 'Sure,\nO'Hanlon is come again.'  What might not have been thy fate in the far\nwest in America, whither thou hadst turned thine eye, saying, 'I will go\nthere, and become an honest man!'  But thou wast not to go there,\nDavid--the blood which thou hadst shed in Scotland was to be required of\nthee; the avenger was at hand, the avenger of blood.  Seized, manacled,\nbrought back to thy native land, condemned to die, thou wast left in thy\nnarrow cell, and told to make the most of thy time, for it was short: and\nthere, in thy narrow cell, and thy time so short, thou didst put the\ncrowning stone to thy strange deeds, by that strange history of thyself,\npenned by thy own hand in the robber tongue.  Thou mightest have been\nbetter employed, David!--but the ruling passion was strong with thee,\neven in the jaws of death.  Thou mightest have been better employed!--but\npeace be with thee, I repeat, and the Almighty's grace and pardon.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\n\nNapoleon--The storm--The cove--Up the country--The trembling\nhand--Irish--Tough battle--Tipperary hills--Elegant lodgings--A\nspeech--Fair specimen--Orangemen.\n\nOnward, onward! and after we had sojourned in Scotland nearly two years,\nthe long continental war had been brought to an end, Napoleon was humbled\nfor a time, and the Bourbons restored to a land which could well have\ndispensed with them; we returned to England, where the corps was\ndisbanded, and my parents with their family retired to private life.  I\nshall pass over in silence the events of a year, which offer little of\ninterest as far as connected with me and mine.  Suddenly, however, the\nsound of war was heard again, Napoleon had broken forth from Elba, and\neverything was in confusion.  Vast military preparations were again made,\nour own corps was levied anew, and my brother became an officer in it;\nbut the danger was soon over, Napoleon was once more quelled, and chained\nfor ever, like Prometheus, to his rock.  As the corps, however, though so\nrecently levied, had already become a very fine one, thanks to my\nfather's energetic drilling, the Government very properly determined to\nturn it to some account, and, as disturbances were apprehended in Ireland\nabout this period, it occurred to them that they could do no better than\ndespatch it to that country.\n\nIn the autumn of the year 1815 we set sail from a port in Essex; we were\nsome eight hundred strong, and were embarked in two ships, very large,\nbut old and crazy; a storm overtook us when off Beachy Head, in which we\nhad nearly foundered.  I was awakened early in the morning by the howling\nof the wind and the uproar on deck.  I kept myself close, however, as is\nstill my constant practice on similar occasions, and waited the result\nwith that apathy and indifference which violent sea-sickness is sure to\nproduce.  We shipped several seas, and once the vessel missing\nstays--which, to do it justice, it generally did at every third or fourth\ntack--we escaped almost by a miracle from being dashed upon the foreland.\nOn the eighth day of our voyage we were in sight of Ireland.  The weather\nwas now calm and serene, the sun shone brightly on the sea and on certain\ngreen hills in the distance, on which I descried what at first sight I\nbelieved to be two ladies gathering flowers, which, however, on our\nnearer approach, proved to be two tall white towers, doubtless built for\nsome purpose or other, though I did not learn for what.\n\nWe entered a kind of bay, or cove, by a narrow inlet; it was a beautiful\nand romantic place this cove, very spacious, and, being nearly\nland-locked, was sheltered from every wind.  A small island, every inch\nof which was covered with fortifications, appeared to swim upon the\nwaters, whose dark blue denoted their immense depth; tall green hills,\nwhich ascended gradually from the shore, formed the background to the\nwest; they were carpeted to the top with turf of the most vivid green,\nand studded here and there with woods, seemingly of oak; there was a\nstrange old castle half-way up the ascent, a village on a crag--but the\nmists of morning were half veiling the scene when I surveyed it, and the\nmists of time are now hanging densely between it and my no longer\nyouthful eye; I may not describe it;--nor will I try.\n\nLeaving the ship in the cove, we passed up a wide river in boats till we\ncame to a city, where we disembarked.  It was a large city, as large as\nEdinburgh to my eyes; there were plenty of fine houses, but little\nneatness; the streets were full of impurities; handsome equipages rolled\nalong, but the greater part of the population were in rags; beggars\nabounded; there was no lack of merriment, however; boisterous shouts of\nlaughter were heard on every side.  It appeared a city of contradictions.\nAfter a few days' rest we marched from this place in two divisions.  My\nfather commanded the second, I walked by his side.\n\nOur route lay up the country; the country at first offered no very\nremarkable feature, it was pretty, but tame.  On the second day, however,\nits appearance had altered, it had become more wild; a range of distant\nmountains bounded the horizon.  We passed through several villages, as I\nsuppose I may term them, of low huts, the walls formed of rough stones\nwithout mortar, the roof of flags laid over wattles and wicker-work; they\nseemed to be inhabited solely by women and children; the latter were\nnaked, the former, in general, blear-eyed beldames, who sat beside the\ndoors on low stools, spinning.  We saw, however, both men and women\nworking at a distance in the fields.\n\nI was thirsty; and going up to an ancient crone, employed in the manner\nwhich I have described, I asked her for water; she looked me in the face,\nappeared to consider a moment, then tottering into her hut, presently\nreappeared with a small pipkin of milk, which she offered to me with a\ntrembling hand.  I drank the milk; it was sour, but I found it highly\nrefreshing.  I then took out a penny and offered it to her, whereupon she\nshook her head, smiled, and, patting my face with her skinny hand,\nmurmured some words in a tongue which I had never heard before.\n\nI walked on by my father's side, holding the stirrup-leather of his\nhorse; presently several low uncouth cars passed by, drawn by starved\ncattle: the drivers were tall fellows, with dark features and athletic\nframes--they wore long loose blue cloaks with sleeves, which last,\nhowever, dangled unoccupied: these cloaks appeared in tolerably good\ncondition, not so their under garments.  On their heads were broad\nslouching hats: the generality of them were bare-footed.  As they passed,\nthe soldiers jested with them in the patois of East Anglia, whereupon the\nfellows laughed, and appeared to jest with the soldiers; but what they\nsaid who knows, it being in a rough guttural language, strange and wild.\nThe soldiers stared at each other, and were silent.\n\n'A strange language that!' said a young officer to my father, 'I don't\nunderstand a word of it; what can it be?'\n\n'Irish!' said my father, with a loud voice, 'and a bad language it is, I\nhave known it of old, that is, I have often heard it spoken when I was a\nguardsman in London.  There's one part of London where all the Irish\nlive--at least all the worst of them--and there they hatch their\nvillainies and speak this tongue; it is that which keeps them together\nand makes them dangerous: I was once sent there to seize a couple of\ndeserters--Irish--who had taken refuge amongst their companions; we found\nthem in what was in my time called a ken, that is a house where only\nthieves and desperadoes are to be found.  Knowing on what kind of\nbusiness I was bound, I had taken with me a sergeant's party; it was well\nI did so.  We found the deserters in a large room, with at least thirty\nruffians, horrid-looking fellows, seated about a long table, drinking,\nswearing, and talking Irish.  Ah! we had a tough battle, I remember; the\ntwo fellows did nothing, but sat still, thinking it best to be quiet; but\nthe rest, with an ubbubboo like the blowing up of a powder-magazine,\nsprang up, brandishing their sticks; for these fellows always carry\nsticks with them even to bed, and not unfrequently spring up in their\nsleep, striking left and right.'\n\n'And did you take the deserters?' said the officer.\n\n'Yes,' said my father; 'for we formed at the end of the room, and charged\nwith fixed bayonets, which compelled the others to yield notwithstanding\ntheir numbers; but the worst was when we got out into the street; the\nwhole district had become alarmed, and hundreds came pouring down upon\nus--men, women, and children.  Women, did I say!--they looked fiends,\nhalf naked, with their hair hanging down over their bosoms; they tore up\nthe very pavement to hurl at us, sticks rang about our ears, stones, and\nIrish--I liked the Irish worst of all, it sounded so horrid, especially\nas I did not understand it.  It's a bad language.'\n\n'A queer tongue,' said I; 'I wonder if I could learn it.'\n\n'Learn it!' said my father; 'what should you learn it for?--however, I am\nnot afraid of that.  It is not like Scotch, no person can learn it, save\nthose who are born to it, and even in Ireland the respectable people do\nnot speak it, only the wilder sort, like those we have passed.'\n\nWithin a day or two we had reached a tall range of mountains running\nnorth and south, which I was told were those of Tipperary; along the\nskirts of these we proceeded till we came to a town, the principal one of\nthese regions.  It was on the bank of a beautiful river, which separated\nit from the mountains.  It was rather an ancient place, and might contain\nsome ten thousand inhabitants--I found that it was our destination; there\nwere extensive barracks at the farther end, in which the corps took up\nits quarters; with respect to ourselves, we took lodgings in a house\nwhich stood in the principal street.\n\n'You never saw more elegant lodgings than these, captain,' said the\nmaster of the house, a tall, handsome, and athletic man, who came up\nwhilst our little family were seated at dinner late in the afternoon of\nthe day of our arrival; 'they beat anything in this town of Clonmel.  I\ndo not let them for the sake of interest, and to none but gentlemen in\nthe army, in order that myself and my wife, who is from Londonderry, may\nhave the advantage of pleasant company, genteel company; ay, and\nProtestant company, captain.  It did my heart good when I saw your honour\nride in at the head of all those fine fellows, real Protestants, I'll\nengage, not a Papist among them, they are too good-looking and honest-\nlooking for that.  So I no sooner saw your honour at the head of your\narmy, with that handsome young gentleman holding by your stirrup, than I\nsaid to my wife, Mistress Hyne, who is from Londonderry, \"God bless me,\"\nsaid I, \"what a truly Protestant countenance, what a noble bearing, and\nwhat a sweet young gentleman.  By the silver hairs of his honour\"--and\nsure enough I never saw hairs more regally silver than those of your\nhonour--\"by his honour's gray silver hairs, and by my own soul, which is\nnot worthy to be mentioned in the same day with one of them--it would be\nno more than decent and civil to run out and welcome such a father and\nson coming in at the head of such a Protestant military.\"  And then my\nwife, who is from Londonderry, Mistress Hyne, looking me in the face like\na fairy as she is, \"You may say that,\" says she.  \"It would be but decent\nand civil, honey.\"  And your honour knows how I ran out of my own door\nand welcomed your honour riding in company with your son, who was\nwalking; how I welcomed ye both at the head of your royal regiment, and\nhow I shook your honour by the hand, saying, I am glad to see your\nhonour, and your honour's son, and your honour's royal military\nProtestant regiment.  And now I have you in the house, and right proud I\nam to have ye one and all; one, two, three, four, true Protestants every\none, no Papists here; and I have made bold to bring up a bottle of claret\nwhich is now waiting behind the door; and, when your honour and your\nfamily have dined, I will make bold too to bring up Mistress Hyne, from\nLondonderry, to introduce to your honour's lady, and then we'll drink to\nthe health of King George, God bless him; to the \"glorious and\nimmortal\"--to Boyne water--to your honour's speedy promotion to be Lord\nLieutenant, and to the speedy downfall of the Pope and Saint Anthony of\nPadua.'\n\nSuch was the speech of the Irish Protestant addressed to my father in the\nlong lofty dining-room with three windows, looking upon the high street\nof the good town of Clonmel, as he sat at meat with his family, after\nsaying grace like a true-hearted respectable soldier as he was.\n\n'A bigot and an Orangeman!'  Oh yes!  It is easier to apply epithets of\nopprobrium to people than to make yourself acquainted with their history\nand position.  He was a specimen, and a fair specimen, of a most\nremarkable body of men, who during two centuries have fought a good fight\nin Ireland in the cause of civilisation and religious truth; they were\nsent as colonists, few in number, into a barbarous and unhappy country,\nwhere ever since, though surrounded with difficulties of every kind, they\nhave maintained their ground; theirs has been no easy life, nor have\ntheir lines fallen upon very pleasant places; amidst darkness they have\nheld up a lamp, and it would be well for Ireland were all her children\nlike these her adopted ones.  'But they are fierce and sanguinary,' it is\nsaid.  Ay, ay! they have not unfrequently opposed the keen sword to the\nsavage pike.  'But they are bigoted and narrow-minded.'  Ay, ay! they do\nnot like idolatry, and will not bow the knee before a stone!  'But their\nlanguage is frequently indecorous.'  Go to, my dainty one, did ye ever\nlisten to the voice of Papist cursing?\n\nThe Irish Protestants have faults, numerous ones; but the greater number\nof these may be traced to the peculiar circumstances of their position:\nbut they have virtues, numerous ones; and their virtues are their own,\ntheir industry, their energy, and their undaunted resolution are their\nown.  They have been vilified and traduced--but what would Ireland be\nwithout them?  I repeat, that it would be well for her were all her sons\nno worse than these much-calumniated children of her adoption.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\nProtestant young gentlemen--The Greek letters--Open chimney--Murtagh--Paris\nand Salamanca--Nothing to do--To whit, to whoo!--The pack of cards--Before\nChristmas.\n\nWe continued at this place for some months, during which time the\nsoldiers performed their duties, whatever they were; and I, having no\nduties to perform, was sent to school.  I had been to English schools,\nand to the celebrated one of Edinburgh; but my education, at the present\nday, would not be what it is--perfect, had I never had the honour of\nbeing _alumnus_ in an Irish seminary.\n\n'Captain,' said our kind host, 'you would, no doubt, wish that the young\ngentleman should enjoy every advantage which the town may afford towards\nhelping him on in the path of genteel learning.  It's a great pity that\nhe should waste his time in idleness--doing nothing else than what he\nsays he has been doing for the last fortnight--fishing in the river for\ntrouts which he never catches; and wandering up the glen in the mountain,\nin search of the hips that grow there.  Now, we have a school here, where\nhe can learn the most elegant Latin, and get an insight into the Greek\nletters, which is desirable; and where, moreover, he will have an\nopportunity of making acquaintance with all the Protestant young\ngentlemen of the place, the handsome well-dressed young persons whom your\nhonour sees in the church on the Sundays, when your honour goes there in\nthe morning, with the rest of the Protestant military; for it is no\nPapist school, though there may be a Papist or two there--a few poor\nfarmers' sons from the country, with whom there is no necessity for your\nhonour's child to form any acquaintance at all, at all!'\n\nAnd to the school I went, where I read the Latin tongue and the Greek\nletters, with a nice old clergyman, who sat behind a black oaken desk,\nwith a huge Elzevir Flaccus before him, in a long gloomy kind of hall,\nwith a broken stone floor, the roof festooned with cobwebs, the walls\nconsiderably dilapidated, and covered over with strange figures and\nhieroglyphics, evidently produced by the application of burnt stick; and\nthere I made acquaintance with the Protestant young gentlemen of the\nplace, who, with whatever _eclat_ they might appear at church on a\nSunday, did assuredly not exhibit to much advantage in the schoolroom on\nthe week days, either with respect to clothes or looks.  And there I was\nin the habit of sitting on a large stone, before the roaring fire in the\nhuge open chimney, and entertaining certain of the Protestant young\ngentlemen of my own age, seated on similar stones, with extraordinary\naccounts of my own adventures, and those of the corps, with an occasional\nanecdote extracted from the story-books of Hickathrift and Wight Wallace,\npretending to be conning the lesson all the while.\n\nAnd there I made acquaintance, notwithstanding the hint of the landlord,\nwith the Papist 'gossoons,' as they were called, the farmers' sons from\nthe country; and of these gossoons, of whom there were three, two might\nbe reckoned as nothing at all; in the third, however, I soon discovered\nthat there was something extraordinary.\n\nHe was about sixteen years old, and above six feet high, dressed in a\ngray suit; the coat, from its size, appeared to have been made for him\nsome ten years before.  He was remarkably narrow-chested and\nround-shouldered, owing, perhaps as much to the tightness of his garment\nas to the hand of nature.  His face was long, and his complexion swarthy,\nrelieved, however, by certain freckles, with which the skin was\nplentifully studded.  He had strange wandering eyes, gray, and somewhat\nunequal in size; they seldom rested on the book, but were generally\nwandering about the room, from one object to another.  Sometimes he would\nfix them intently on the wall, and then suddenly starting, as if from a\nreverie, he would commence making certain mysterious movements with his\nthumbs and forefingers, as if he were shuffling something from him.\n\nOne morning, as he sat by himself on a bench, engaged in this manner, I\nwent up to him, and said, 'Good-day, Murtagh; you do not seem to have\nmuch to do?'\n\n'Faith, you may say that, Shorsha dear!--it is seldom much to do that I\nhave.'\n\n'And what are you doing with your hands?'\n\n'Faith, then, if I must tell you, I was e'en dealing with the cards.'\n\n'Do you play much at cards?'\n\n'Sorra a game, Shorsha, have I played with the cards since my uncle\nPhelim, the thief, stole away the ould pack, when he went to settle in\nthe county Waterford!'\n\n'But you have other things to do?'\n\n'Sorra anything else has Murtagh to do that he cares about and that makes\nme dread so going home at nights.'\n\n'I should like to know all about you; where do you live, joy?'\n\n'Faith, then, ye shall know all about me, and where I live.  It is at a\nplace called the Wilderness that I live, and they call it so, because it\nis a fearful wild place, without any house near it but my father's own;\nand that's where I live when at home.'\n\n'And your father is a farmer, I suppose?'\n\n'You may say that; and it is a farmer I should have been, like my brother\nDenis, had not my uncle Phelim, the thief, tould my father to send me to\nschool, to learn Greek letters, that I might be made a saggart of, and\nsent to Paris and Salamanca.'\n\n'And you would rather be a farmer than a priest?'\n\n'You may say that!--for, were I a farmer, like the rest, I should have\nsomething to do, like the rest--something that I cared for--and I should\ncome home tired at night, and fall asleep, as the rest do, before the\nfire; but when I comes home at night I am not tired, for I have been\ndoing nothing all day that I care for; and then I sits down and stares\nabout me, and at the fire, till I become frighted; and then I shouts to\nmy brother Denis, or to the gossoons, \"Get up, I say, and let's be doing\nsomething; tell us the tale of Finn-ma-Coul, and how he lay down in the\nShannon's bed, and let the river flow down his jaws!\"  Arrah, Shorsha!  I\nwish you would come and stay with us, and tell us some o' your sweet\nstories of your own self and the snake ye carried about wid ye.  Faith,\nShorsha dear! that snake bates anything about Finn-ma-Coul or Brian\nBoroo, the thieves two, bad luck to them!'\n\n'And do they get up and tell you stories?'\n\n'Sometimes they does, but oftenmost they curses me, and bids me be quiet!\nBut I can't be quiet, either before the fire or abed; so I runs out of\nthe house, and stares at the rocks, at the trees, and sometimes at the\nclouds, as they run a race across the bright moon; and, the more I\nstares, the more frighted I grows, till I screeches and holloas.  And\nlast night I went into the barn, and hid my face in the straw; and there,\nas I lay and shivered in the straw, I heard a voice above my head singing\nout \"To whit, to whoo!\" and then up I starts, and runs into the house,\nand falls over my brother Denis, as he lies at the fire.  \"What's that\nfor?\" says he.  \"Get up, you thief!\" says I, \"and be helping me.  I have\nbeen out into the barn, and an owl has crow'd at me!\"'\n\n'And what has this to do with playing cards?'\n\n'Little enough, Shorsha dear!--If there were card-playing, I should not\nbe frighted.'\n\n'And why do you not play at cards?'\n\n'Did I not tell you that the thief, my uncle Phelim, stole away the pack?\nIf we had the pack, my brother Denis and the gossoons would be ready\nenough to get up from their sleep before the fire, and play cards with me\nfor ha'pence, or eggs, or nothing at all; but the pack is gone--bad luck\nto the thief who took it!'\n\n'And why don't you buy another?'\n\n'Is it of buying you are speaking?  And where am I to get the money?'\n\n'Ah! that's another thing!'\n\n'Faith it is, honey!--And now the Christmas holidays is coming, when I\nshall be at home by day as well as night, and then what am I to do?  Since\nI have been a saggarting, I have been good for nothing at all--neither\nfor work nor Greek--only to play cards!  Faith, it's going mad I will\nbe!'\n\n'I say, Murtagh!'\n\n'Yes, Shorsha dear!'\n\n'I have a pack of cards.'\n\n'You don't say so, Shorsha ma vourneen?--you don't say that you have\ncards fifty-two?'\n\n'I do, though; and they are quite new--never been once used.'\n\n'And you'll be lending them to me, I warrant?'\n\n'Don't think it!--But I'll sell them to you, joy, if you like.'\n\n'Hanam mon Dioul! am I not after telling you that I have no money at\nall!'\n\n'But you have as good as money, to me, at least; and I'll take it in\nexchange.'\n\n'What's that, Shorsha dear?'\n\n'Irish!'\n\n'Irish?'\n\n'Yes, you speak Irish; I heard you talking it the other day to the\ncripple.  You shall teach me Irish.'\n\n'And is it a language-master you'd be making of me?'\n\n'To be sure!--what better can you do?--it would help you to pass your\ntime at school.  You can't learn Greek, so you must teach Irish!'\n\nBefore Christmas, Murtagh was playing at cards with his brother Denis,\nand I could speak a considerable quantity of broken Irish.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nTemplemore--Devil's Mountain--No companion--Force of circumstance--Way of\nthe world--Ruined castle--Grim and desolate--The donjon--Old woman--My\nown house.\n\nWhen Christmas was over, and the new year commenced, we broke up our\nquarters, and marched away to Templemore.  This was a large military\nstation, situated in a wild and thinly inhabited country.  Extensive bogs\nwere in the neighbourhood, connected with the huge bog of Allen, the\nPalus Maeotis of Ireland.  Here and there was seen a ruined castle\nlooming through the mists of winter; whilst, at the distance of seven\nmiles, rose a singular mountain, exhibiting in its brow a chasm, or\nvacuum, just, for all the world, as if a piece had been bitten out; a\nfeat which, according to the tradition of the country, had actually been\nperformed by his Satanic majesty, who, after flying for some leagues with\nthe morsel in his mouth, becoming weary, dropped it in the vicinity of\nCashel, where it may now be seen in the shape of a bold bluff hill,\ncrowned with the ruins of a stately edifice, probably built by some\nancient Irish king.\n\nWe had been here only a few days, when my brother, who, as I have before\nobserved, had become one of his Majesty's officers, was sent on\ndetachment to a village at about ten miles' distance.  He was not\nsixteen, and, though three years older than myself, scarcely my equal in\nstature, for I had become tall and large-limbed for my age; but there was\na spirit in him which would not have disgraced a general; and, nothing\ndaunted at the considerable responsibility which he was about to incur,\nhe marched sturdily out of the barrack-yard at the head of his party,\nconsisting of twenty light-infantry men, and a tall grenadier sergeant,\nselected expressly by my father, for the soldier-like qualities which he\npossessed, to accompany his son on this his first expedition.  So out of\nthe barrack-yard, with something of an air, marched my dear brother, his\nsingle drum and fife playing the inspiring old melody,\n\n   Marlbrouk is gone to the wars,\n   He'll never return no more!\n\nI soon missed my brother, for I was now alone, with no being, at all\nassimilating in age, with whom I could exchange a word.  Of late years,\nfrom being almost constantly at school, I had cast aside, in a great\ndegree, my unsocial habits and natural reserve, but in the desolate\nregion in which we now were there was no school; and I felt doubly the\nloss of my brother, whom, moreover, I tenderly loved for his own sake.\nBooks I had none, at least such 'as I cared about'; and with respect to\nthe old volume, the wonders of which had first beguiled me into common\nreading, I had so frequently pored over its pages, that I had almost got\nits contents by heart.  I was therefore in danger of falling into the\nsame predicament as Murtagh, becoming 'frighted' from having nothing to\ndo!  Nay, I had not even his resources; I cared not for cards, even if I\npossessed them and could find people disposed to play with them.  However,\nI made the most of circumstances, and roamed about the desolate fields\nand bogs in the neighbourhood, sometimes entering the cabins of the\npeasantry, with a 'God's blessing upon you, good people!' where I would\ntake my seat on the 'stranger's stone' at the corner of the hearth, and,\nlooking them full in the face, would listen to the carles and carlines\ntalking Irish.\n\nAh, that Irish!  How frequently do circumstances, at first sight the most\ntrivial and unimportant, exercise a mighty and permanent influence on our\nhabits and pursuits!--how frequently is a stream turned aside from its\nnatural course by some little rock or knoll, causing it to make an abrupt\nturn!  On a wild road in Ireland I had heard Irish spoken for the first\ntime; and I was seized with a desire to learn Irish, the acquisition of\nwhich, in my case, became the stepping-stone to other languages.  I had\npreviously learnt Latin, or rather Lilly; but neither Latin nor Lilly\nmade me a philologist.  I had frequently heard French and other\nlanguages, but had felt little desire to become acquainted with them; and\nwhat, it may be asked, was there connected with the Irish calculated to\nrecommend it to my attention?\n\nFirst of all, and principally, I believe, the strangeness and singularity\nof its tones; then there was something mysterious and uncommon associated\nwith its use.  It was not a school language, to acquire which was\nconsidered an imperative duty; no, no; nor was it a drawing-room\nlanguage, drawled out occasionally, in shreds and patches, by the ladies\nof generals and other great dignitaries, to the ineffable dismay of poor\nofficers' wives.  Nothing of the kind; but a speech spoken in out-of-the-\nway desolate places, and in cut-throat kens, where thirty ruffians, at\nthe sight of the king's minions, would spring up with brandished sticks\nand an 'ubbubboo like the blowing up of a powder-magazine.'  Such were\nthe points connected with the Irish, which first awakened in my mind the\ndesire of acquiring it; and by acquiring it I became, as I have already\nsaid, enamoured of languages.  Having learnt one by choice, I speedily,\nas the reader will perceive, learnt others, some of which were widely\ndifferent from Irish.\n\nAh, that Irish!  I am much indebted to it in more ways than one.  But I\nam afraid I have followed the way of the world, which is very much wont\nto neglect original friends and benefactors.  I frequently find myself,\nat present, turning up my nose at Irish when I hear it in the street; yet\nI have still a kind of regard for it, the fine old language:\n\n   A labhair Padruic n'insefail nan riogh.\n\nOne of the most peculiar features of this part of Ireland is the ruined\ncastles, which are so thick and numerous that the face of the country\nappears studded with them, it being difficult to choose any situation\nfrom which one, at least, may not be descried.  They are of various ages\nand styles of architecture, some of great antiquity, like the stately\nremains which crown the Crag of Cashel; others built by the early English\nconquerors; others, and probably the greater part, erections of the times\nof Elizabeth and Cromwell.  The whole speaking monuments of the troubled\nand insecure state of the country, from the most remote periods to a\ncomparatively modern time.\n\nFrom the windows of the room where I slept I had a view of one of these\nold places--an indistinct one, it is true, the distance being too great\nto permit me to distinguish more than the general outline.  I had an\nanxious desire to explore it.  It stood to the south-east; in which\ndirection, however, a black bog intervened, which had more than once\nbaffled all my attempts to cross it.  One morning, however, when the sun\nshone brightly upon the old building, it appeared so near, that I felt\nashamed at not being able to accomplish a feat seemingly so easy; I\ndetermined, therefore, upon another trial.  I reached the bog, and was\nabout to venture upon its black surface, and to pick my way amongst its\ninnumerable holes, yawning horribly, and half filled with water black as\nsoot, when it suddenly occurred to me that there was a road to the south,\nby following which I might find a more convenient route to the object of\nmy wishes.  The event justified my expectations, for, after following the\nroad for some three miles, seemingly in the direction of the Devil's\nMountain, I suddenly beheld the castle on my left.\n\nI diverged from the road, and, crossing two or three fields, came to a\nsmall grassy plain, in the midst of which stood the castle.  About a gun-\nshot to the south was a small village, which had, probably, in ancient\ndays, sprung up beneath its protection.  A kind of awe came over me as I\napproached the old building.  The sun no longer shone upon it, and it\nlooked so grim, so desolate and solitary; and here was I, in that wild\ncountry, alone with that grim building before me.  The village was within\nsight, it is true; but it might be a village of the dead for what I knew;\nno sound issued from it, no smoke was rising from its roofs, neither man\nnor beast was visible, no life, no motion--it looked as desolate as the\ncastle itself.  Yet I was bent on the adventure, and moved on towards the\ncastle across the green plain, occasionally casting a startled glance\naround me; and now I was close to it.\n\nIt was surrounded by a quadrangular wall, about ten feet in height, with\na square tower at each corner.  At first I could discover no entrance;\nwalking round, however, to the northern side, I found a wide and lofty\ngateway with a tower above it, similar to those at the angles of the\nwall; on this side the ground sloped gently down towards the bog, which\nwas here skirted by an abundant growth of copse-wood and a few evergreen\noaks.  I passed through the gateway, and found myself within a square\ninclosure of about two acres.  On one side rose a round and lofty keep,\nor donjon, with a conical roof, part of which had fallen down, strewing\nthe square with its ruins.  Close to the keep, on the other side, stood\nthe remains of an oblong house, built something in the modern style, with\nvarious window-holes; nothing remained but the bare walls and a few\nprojecting stumps of beams, which seemed to have been half burnt.  The\ninterior of the walls was blackened, as if by fire; fire also appeared at\none time to have raged out of the window-holes, for the outside about\nthem was black, portentously so.  'I wonder what has been going on here?'\nI exclaimed.\n\nThere were echoes among the walls as I walked about the court.  I entered\nthe keep by a low and frowning doorway: the lower floor consisted of a\nlarge dungeon-like room, with a vaulted roof; on the left hand was a\nwinding staircase in the thickness of the wall; it looked anything but\ninviting; yet I stole softly up, my heart beating.  On the top of the\nfirst flight of stairs was an arched doorway, to the left was a dark\npassage, to the right, stairs leading still higher.  I stepped under the\narch and found myself in an apartment somewhat similar to the one below,\nbut higher.  There was an object at the farther end.\n\nAn old woman, at least eighty, was seated on a stone, cowering over a few\nsticks burning feebly on what had once been a right noble and cheerful\nhearth; her side-glance was towards the doorway as I entered, for she had\nheard my foot-steps.  I stood suddenly still, and her haggard glance\nrested on my face.\n\n'Is this your house, mother?' I at length demanded, in the language which\nI thought she would best understand.\n\n'Yes, my house, my own house; the house of the broken-hearted.'\n\n'Any other person's house?' I demanded.\n\n'My own house, the beggar's house--the accursed house of Cromwell!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\n\nA visit--Figure of a man--The dog of peace--The raw wound--The\nguardroom--Boy soldier--Person in authority--Never solitary--Clergyman\nand family--Still-hunting--Fairy man--Near sunset--Bagg--Left-handed\nhitter--Irish and supernatural--At Swanton Morley.\n\nOne morning I set out, designing to pay a visit to my brother at the\nplace where he was detached; the distance was rather considerable, yet I\nhoped to be back by evening fall, for I was now a shrewd walker, thanks\nto constant practice.  I set out early, and, directing my course towards\nthe north, I had in less than two hours accomplished considerably more\nthan half of the journey.  The weather had at first been propitious: a\nslight frost had rendered the ground firm to the tread, and the skies\nwere clear; but now a change came over the scene, the skies darkened, and\na heavy snowstorm came on; the road then lay straight through a bog, and\nwas bounded by a deep trench on both sides; I was making the best of my\nway, keeping as nearly as I could in the middle of the road, lest,\nblinded by the snow which was frequently borne into my eyes by the wind,\nI might fall into the dyke, when all at once I heard a shout to windward,\nand turning my eyes I saw the figure of a man, and what appeared to be an\nanimal of some kind, coming across the bog with great speed, in the\ndirection of myself; the nature of the ground seemed to offer but little\nimpediment to these beings, both clearing the holes and abysses which lay\nin their way with surprising agility; the animal was, however, some\nslight way in advance, and, bounding over the dyke, appeared on the road\njust before me.  It was a dog, of what species I cannot tell, never\nhaving seen the like before or since; the head was large and round; the\nears so tiny as scarcely to be discernible; the eyes of a fiery red: in\nsize it was rather small than large; and the coat, which was remarkably\nsmooth, as white as the falling flakes.  It placed itself directly in my\npath, and showing its teeth, and bristling its coat, appeared determined\nto prevent my progress.  I had an ashen stick in my hand, with which I\nthreatened it; this, however, only served to increase its fury; it rushed\nupon me, and I had the utmost difficulty to preserve myself from its\nfangs.\n\n'What are you doing with the dog, the fairy dog?' said a man, who at this\ntime likewise cleared the dyke at a bound.\n\nHe was a very tall man, rather well dressed as it should seem; his\ngarments, however, were, like my own, so covered with snow that I could\nscarcely discern their quality.\n\n'What are ye doing with the dog of peace?'\n\n'I wish he would show himself one,' said I; 'I said nothing to him, but\nhe placed himself in my road, and would not let me pass.'\n\n'Of course he would not be letting you till he knew where ye were going.'\n\n'He's not much of a fairy,' said I, 'or he would know that without\nasking; tell him that I am going to see my brother.'\n\n'And who is your brother, little Sas?'\n\n'What my father is, a royal soldier.'\n\n'Oh, ye are going then to the detachment at--; by my shoul, I have a good\nmind to be spoiling your journey.'\n\n'You are doing that already,' said I, 'keeping me here talking about dogs\nand fairies; you had better go home and get some salve to cure that place\nover your eye; it's catching cold you'll be, in so much snow.'\n\nOn one side of the man's forehead there was a raw and staring wound, as\nif from a recent and terrible blow.\n\n'Faith, then I'll be going, but it's taking you wid me I will be.'\n\n'And where will you take me?'\n\n'Why, then, to Ryan's Castle, little Sas.'\n\n'You do not speak the language very correctly,' said I; 'it is not Sas\nyou should call me--'tis Sassannach,' and forthwith I accompanied the\nword with a speech full of flowers of Irish rhetoric.\n\nThe man looked upon me for a moment, fixedly, then, bending his head\ntowards his breast, he appeared to be undergoing a kind of convulsion,\nwhich was accompanied by a sound something resembling laughter; presently\nhe looked at me, and there was a broad grin on his features.\n\n'By my shoul, it's a thing of peace I'm thinking ye.'\n\nBut now with a whisking sound came running down the road a hare; it was\nnearly upon us before it perceived us; suddenly stopping short, however,\nit sprang into the bog on the right-hand side; after it amain bounded the\ndog of peace, followed by the man, but not until he had nodded to me a\nfarewell salutation.  In a few moments I lost sight of him amidst the\nsnowflakes.\n\nThe weather was again clear and fine before I reached the place of\ndetachment.  It was a little wooden barrack, surrounded by a wall of the\nsame material; a sentinel stood at the gate, I passed by him, and,\nentering the building, found myself in a rude kind of guardroom; several\nsoldiers were lying asleep on a wooden couch at one end, others lounged\non benches by the side of a turf fire.  The tall sergeant stood before\nthe fire, holding a cooking utensil in his left hand; on seeing me, he\nmade the military salutation.\n\n'Is my brother here?' said I, rather timidly, dreading to hear that he\nwas out, perhaps for the day.\n\n'The ensign is in his room, sir,' said Bagg, 'I am now preparing his\nmeal, which will presently be ready; you will find the ensign above\nstairs,' and he pointed to a broken ladder which led to some place above.\n\nAnd there I found him--the boy soldier--in a kind of upper loft, so low\nthat I could touch with my hands the sooty rafters; the floor was of\nrough boards, through the joints of which you could see the gleam of the\nsoldiers' fire, and occasionally discern their figures as they moved\nabout; in one corner was a camp bedstead, by the side of which hung the\nchild's sword, gorget, and sash; a deal table stood in the proximity of\nthe rusty grate, where smoked and smouldered a pile of black turf from\nthe bog,--a deal table without a piece of baize to cover it, yet fraught\nwith things not devoid of interest: a Bible, given by a mother; the\n_Odyssey_, the Greek _Odyssey_; a flute, with broad silver keys; crayons,\nmoreover, and water-colours; and a sketch of a wild prospect near, which,\nthough but half finished, afforded ample proof of the excellence and\nskill of the boyish hand now occupied upon it.\n\nAh! he was a sweet being, that boy soldier, a plant of early promise,\nbidding fair to become in after time all that is great, good, and\nadmirable.  I have read of a remarkable Welshman, of whom it was said,\nwhen the grave closed over him, that he could frame a harp, and play it;\nbuild a ship, and sail it; compose an ode, and set it to music.  A brave\nfellow that son of Wales--but I had once a brother who could do more and\nbetter than this, but the grave has closed over him, as over the gallant\nWelshman of yore; there are now but two that remember him--the one who\nbore him, and the being who was nurtured at the same breast.  He was\ntaken, and I was left!--Truly, the ways of Providence are inscrutable.\n\n'You seem to be very comfortable, John,' said I, looking around the room\nand at the various objects which I have described above: 'you have a good\nroof over your head, and have all your things about you.'\n\n'Yes, I am very comfortable, George, in many respects; I am, moreover,\nindependent, and feel myself a man for the first time in my\nlife--independent did I say?--that's not the word, I am something much\nhigher than that; here am I, not sixteen yet, a person in authority, like\nthe centurion in the book there, with twenty Englishmen under me, worth a\nwhole legion of his men, and that fine fellow Bagg to wait upon me, and\ntake my orders.  Oh! these last six weeks have passed like hours of\nheaven.'\n\n'But your time must frequently hang heavy on your hands; this is a\nstrange wild place, and you must be very solitary?'\n\n'I am never solitary; I have, as you see, all my things about me, and\nthere is plenty of company below stairs.  Not that I mix with the\nsoldiers; if I did, good-bye to my authority; but when I am alone I can\nhear all their discourse through the planks, and I often laugh to myself\nat the funny things they say.'\n\n'And have you any acquaintance here?'\n\n'The very best; much better than the Colonel and the rest, at their grand\nTemplemore; I had never so many in my whole life before.  One has just\nleft me, a gentleman who lives at a distance across the bog; he comes to\ntalk with me about Greek, and the _Odyssey_, for he is a very learned\nman, and understands the old Irish, and various other strange languages.\nHe has had a dispute with Bagg.  On hearing his name, he called him to\nhim, and, after looking at him for some time with great curiosity, said\nthat he was sure he was a Dane.  Bagg, however, took the compliment in\ndudgeon, and said that he was no more a Dane than himself, but a true-\nborn Englishman, and a sergeant of six years' standing.'\n\n'And what other acquaintance have you?'\n\n'All kinds; the whole neighbourhood can't make enough of me.  Amongst\nothers there's the clergyman of the parish and his family; such a\nvenerable old man, such fine sons and daughters!  I am treated by them\nlike a son and a brother--I might be always with them if I pleased;\nthere's one drawback, however, in going to see them; there's a horrible\ncreature in the house, a kind of tutor, whom they keep more from charity\nthan anything else; he is a Papist and, they say, a priest; you should\nsee him scowl sometimes at my red coat, for he hates the king, and not\nunfrequently, when the king's health is drunk, curses him between his\nteeth.  I once got up to strike him; but the youngest of the sisters, who\nis the handsomest, caught my arm and pointed to her forehead.'\n\n'And what does your duty consist of?  Have you nothing else to do than\npay visits and receive them?'\n\n'We do what is required of us, we guard this edifice, perform our\nevolutions, and help the excise; I am frequently called up in the dead of\nnight to go to some wild place or other in quest of an illicit still;\nthis last part of our duty is poor mean work, I don't like it, nor more\ndoes Bagg; though without it we should not see much active service, for\nthe neighbourhood is quiet; save the poor creatures with their stills,\nnot a soul is stirring.  'Tis true there's Jerry Grant.'\n\n'And who is Jerry Grant?'\n\n'Did you never hear of him? that's strange, the whole country is talking\nabout him; he is a kind of outlaw, rebel, or robber, all three I daresay;\nthere's a hundred pounds offered for his head.'\n\n'And where does he live?'\n\n'His proper home, they say, is in the Queen's County, where he has a\nband, but he is a strange fellow, fond of wandering about by himself\namidst the bogs and mountains, and living in the old castles;\noccasionally he quarters himself in the peasants' houses, who let him do\njust what he pleases; he is free of his money, and often does them good\nturns, and can be good-humoured enough, so they don't dislike him.  Then\nhe is what they call a fairy man, a person in league with fairies and\nspirits, and able to work much harm by supernatural means, on which\naccount they hold him in great awe; he is, moreover, a mighty strong and\ntall fellow.  Bagg has seen him.'\n\n'Has he?'\n\n'Yes! and felt him; he too is a strange one.  A few days ago he was told\nthat Grant had been seen hovering about an old castle some two miles off\nin the bog; so one afternoon what does he do but, without saying a word\nto me--for which, by the bye, I ought to put him under arrest, though\nwhat I should do without Bagg I have no idea whatever--what does he do\nbut walk off to the castle, intending, as I suppose, to pay a visit to\nJerry.  He had some difficulty in getting there on account of the turf-\nholes in the bog, which he was not accustomed to; however, thither at\nlast he got and went in.  It was a strange lonesome place, he says, and\nhe did not much like the look of it; however, in he went, and searched\nabout from the bottom to the top and down again, but could find no one;\nhe shouted and hallooed, but nobody answered, save the rooks and choughs,\nwhich started up in great numbers.  \"I have lost my trouble,\" said Bagg,\nand left the castle.  It was now late in the afternoon, near sunset, when\nabout half-way over the bog he met a man--'\n\n'And that man was--'\n\n'Jerry Grant! there's no doubt of it.  Bagg says it was the most sudden\nthing in the world.  He was moving along, making the best of his way,\nthinking of nothing at all save a public-house at Swanton Morley, which\nhe intends to take when he gets home, and the regiment is\ndisbanded--though I hope that will not be for some time yet: he had just\nleaped a turf-hole, and was moving on, when, at the distance of about six\nyards before him, he saw a fellow coming straight towards him.  Bagg says\nthat he stopped short, as suddenly as if he had heard the word halt, when\nmarching at double quick time.  It was quite a surprise, he says, and he\ncan't imagine how the fellow was so close upon him before he was aware.\nHe was an immense tall fellow--Bagg thinks at least two inches taller\nthan himself--very well dressed in a blue coat and buff breeches, for all\nthe world like a squire when going out hunting.  Bagg, however, saw at\nonce that he had a roguish air, and he was on his guard in a moment.\n\"Good-evening to ye, sodger,\" says the fellow, stepping close up to Bagg,\nand staring him in the face.  \"Good-evening to you, sir!  I hope you are\nwell,\" says Bagg.  \"You are looking after some one?\" says the fellow.\n\"Just so, sir,\" says Bagg, and forthwith seized him by the collar; the\nman laughed, Bagg says it was such a strange awkward laugh.  \"Do you know\nwhom you have got hold of, sodger?\" said he.  \"I believe I do, sir,\" said\nBagg, \"and in that belief will hold you fast in the name of King George\nand the quarter sessions\"; the next moment he was sprawling with his\nheels in the air.  Bagg says there was nothing remarkable in that; he was\nonly flung by a kind of wrestling trick, which he could easily have\nbaffled had he been aware of it.  \"You will not do that again, sir,\" said\nhe, as he got up and put himself on his guard.  The fellow laughed again\nmore strangely and awkwardly than before; then, bending his body and\nmoving his head from one side to the other as a cat does before she\nsprings, and crying out, \"Here's for ye, sodger!\" he made a dart at Bagg,\nrushing in with his head foremost.  \"That will do, sir,\" says Bagg, and,\ndrawing himself back, he put in a left-handed blow with all the force of\nhis body and arm, just over the fellow's right eye--Bagg is a left-handed\nhitter, you must know--and it was a blow of that kind which won him his\nfamous battle at Edinburgh with the big Highland sergeant.  Bagg says\nthat he was quite satisfied with the blow, more especially when he saw\nthe fellow reel, fling out his arms, and fall to the ground.  \"And now,\nsir,\" said he, \"I'll make bold to hand you over to the quarter sessions,\nand, if there is a hundred pounds for taking you, who has more right to\nit than myself?\"  So he went forward, but ere he could lay hold of his\nman the other was again on his legs, and was prepared to renew the\ncombat.  They grappled each other--Bagg says he had not much fear of the\nresult, as he now felt himself the best man, the other seeming\nhalf-stunned with the blow--but just then there came on a blast, a\nhorrible roaring wind bearing night upon its wings, snow, and sleet, and\nhail.  Bagg says he had the fellow by the throat quite fast, as he\nthought, but suddenly he became bewildered, and knew not where he was;\nand the man seemed to melt away from his grasp, and the wind howled more\nand more, and the night poured down darker and darker; the snow and the\nsleet thicker and more blinding.  \"Lord have mercy upon us!\" said Bagg.'\n\n_Myself_.  A strange adventure that; it is well that Bagg got home alive.\n\n_John_.  He says that the fight was a fair fight, and that the fling he\ngot was a fair fling, the result of a common enough wrestling trick.  But\nwith respect to the storm, which rose up just in time to save the fellow,\nhe is of opinion that it was not fair, but something Irish and\nsupernatural.\n\n_Myself_.  I daresay he's right.  I have read of witchcraft in the Bible.\n\n_John_.  He wishes much to have one more encounter with the fellow; he\nsays that on fair ground, and in fine weather, he has no doubt that he\ncould master him, and hand him over to the quarter sessions.  He says\nthat a hundred pounds would be no bad thing to be disbanded upon; for he\nwishes to take an inn at Swanton Morley, keep a cock-pit, and live\nrespectably.\n\n_Myself_.  He is quite right; and now kiss me, my darling brother, for I\nmust go back through the bog to Templemore.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\n\nGroom and cob--Strength and symmetry--Where's the saddle?--The first\nride--No more fatigue--Love for horses--Pursuit of words--Philologist and\nPegasus--The smith--What more, agrah?--Sassannach tenpence.\n\nAnd it came to pass that, as I was standing by the door of the barrack\nstable, one of the grooms came out to me, saying, 'I say, young\ngentleman, I wish you would give the cob a breathing this fine morning.'\n\n'Why do you wish me to mount him?' said I; 'you know he is dangerous.  I\nsaw him fling you off his back only a few days ago.'\n\n'Why, that's the very thing, master.  I'd rather see anybody on his back\nthan myself; he does not like me; but, to them he does, he can be as\ngentle as a lamb.'\n\n'But suppose,' said I, 'that he should not like me?'\n\n'We shall soon see that, master,' said the groom; 'and, if so be he shows\ntemper, I will be the first to tell you to get down.  But there's no fear\nof that; you have never angered or insulted him, and to such as you, I\nsay again, he'll be as gentle as a lamb.'\n\n'And how came you to insult him,' said I, 'knowing his temper as you do?'\n\n'Merely through forgetfulness, master: I was riding him about a month\nago, and having a stick in my hand, I struck him, thinking I was on\nanother horse, or rather thinking of nothing at all.  He has never\nforgiven me, though before that time he was the only friend I had in the\nworld; I should like to see you on him, master.'\n\n'I should soon be off him; I can't ride.'\n\n'Then you are all right, master; there's no fear.  Trust him for not\nhurting a young gentleman, an officer's son, who can't ride.  If you were\na blackguard dragoon, indeed, with long spurs, 'twere another thing; as\nit is, he'll treat you as if he were the elder brother that loves you.\nRide!  He'll soon teach you to ride if you leave the matter with him.\nHe's the best riding-master in all Ireland, and the gentlest.'\n\nThe cob was led forth; what a tremendous creature!  I had frequently seen\nhim before, and wondered at him; he was barely fifteen hands, but he had\nthe girth of a metropolitan dray-horse; his head was small in comparison\nwith his immense neck, which curved down nobly to his wide back: his\nchest was broad and fine, and his shoulders models of symmetry and\nstrength; he stood well and powerfully upon his legs, which were somewhat\nshort.  In a word, he was a gallant specimen of the genuine Irish cob, a\nspecies at one time not uncommon, but at the present day nearly extinct.\n\n'There!' said the groom, as he looked at him, half admiringly, half\nsorrowfully, 'with sixteen stone on his back, he'll trot fourteen miles\nin one hour, with your nine stone, some two and a half more ay, and clear\na six-foot wall at the end of it.'\n\n'I'm half afraid,' said I; 'I had rather you would ride him.'\n\n'I'd rather so, too, if he would let me; but he remembers the blow.  Now,\ndon't be afraid, young master, he's longing to go out himself.  He's been\ntrampling with his feet these three days, and I know what that means;\nhe'll let anybody ride him but myself, and thank them; but to me he says,\n\"No! you struck me.\"'\n\n'But,' said I, 'where's the saddle?'\n\n'Never mind the saddle; if you are ever to be a frank rider, you must\nbegin without a saddle; besides, if he felt a saddle, he would think you\ndon't trust him, and leave you to yourself.  Now, before you mount, make\nhis acquaintance--see there, how he kisses you and licks your face, and\nsee how he lifts his foot, that's to shake hands.  You may trust him--now\nyou are on his back at last; mind how you hold the bridle--gently,\ngently!  It's not four pair of hands like yours can hold him if he wishes\nto be off.  Mind what I tell you--leave it all to him.'\n\nOff went the cob at a slow and gentle trot, too fast and rough, however,\nfor so inexperienced a rider.  I soon felt myself sliding off, the animal\nperceived it too, and instantly stood stone still till I had righted\nmyself; and now the groom came up: 'When you feel yourself going,' said\nhe, 'don't lay hold of the mane, that's no use; mane never yet saved man\nfrom falling, no more than straw from drowning; it's his sides you must\ncling to with your calves and feet, till you learn to balance yourself.\nThat's it, now abroad with you; I'll bet my comrade a pot of beer that\nyou'll be a regular rough-rider by the time you come back.'\n\nAnd so it proved; I followed the directions of the groom, and the cob\ngave me every assistance.  How easy is riding, after the first timidity\nis got over, to supple and youthful limbs; and there is no second fear.\nThe creature soon found that the nerves of his rider were in proper tone.\nTurning his head half round, he made a kind of whining noise, flung out a\nlittle foam, and set off.\n\nIn less than two hours I had made the circuit of the Devil's Mountain,\nand was returning along the road, bathed with perspiration, but screaming\nwith delight; the cob laughing in his equine way, scattering foam and\npebbles to the left and right, and trotting at the rate of sixteen miles\nan hour.\n\nOh, that ride! that first ride!--most truly it was an epoch in my\nexistence; and I still look back to it with feelings of longing and\nregret.  People may talk of first love--it is a very agreeable event, I\ndaresay--but give me the flush, and triumph, and glorious sweat of a\nfirst ride, like mine on the mighty cob!  My whole frame was shaken, it\nis true; and during one long week I could hardly move foot or hand; but\nwhat of that?  By that one trial I had become free, as I may say, of the\nwhole equine species.  No more fatigue, no more stiffness of joints,\nafter that first ride round the Devil's Hill on the cob.\n\nOh, that cob! that Irish cob!--may the sod lie lightly over the bones of\nthe strongest, speediest, and most gallant of its kind!  Oh! the days\nwhen, issuing from the barrack-gate of Templemore, we commenced our hurry-\nskurry just as inclination led--now across the fields--direct over stone\nwalls and running brooks--mere pastime for the cob!--sometimes along the\nroad to Thurles and Holy Cross, even to distant Cahir!--what was distance\nto the cob?\n\nIt was thus that the passion for the equine race was first awakened\nwithin me--a passion which, up to the present time, has been rather on\nthe increase than diminishing.  It is no blind passion; the horse being a\nnoble and generous creature, intended by the All-Wise to be the helper\nand friend of man, to whom he stands next in the order of creation.  On\nmany occasions of my life I have been much indebted to the horse, and\nhave found in him a friend and coadjutor, when human help and sympathy\nwere not to be obtained.  It is therefore natural enough that I should\nlove the horse; but the love which I entertain for him has always been\nblended with respect; for I soon perceived that, though disposed to be\nthe friend and helper of man, he is by no means inclined to be his slave;\nin which respect he differs from the dog, who will crouch when beaten;\nwhereas the horse spurns, for he is aware of his own worth and that he\ncarries death within the horn of his heel.  If, therefore, I found it\neasy to love the horse, I found it equally natural to respect him.\n\nI much question whether philology, or the passion for languages, requires\nso little of an apology as the love for horses.  It has been said, I\nbelieve, that the more languages a man speaks, the more a man is he;\nwhich is very true, provided he acquires languages as a medium for\nbecoming acquainted with the thoughts and feelings of the various\nsections into which the human race is divided; but, in that case, he\nshould rather be termed a philosopher than a philologist--between which\ntwo the difference is wide indeed!  An individual may speak and read a\ndozen languages, and yet be an exceedingly poor creature, scarcely half a\nman; and the pursuit of tongues for their own sake, and the mere\nsatisfaction of acquiring them, surely argues an intellect of a very low\norder; a mind disposed to be satisfied with mean and grovelling things;\ntaking more pleasure in the trumpery casket than in the precious treasure\nwhich it contains; in the pursuit of words, than in the acquisition of\nideas.\n\nI cannot help thinking that it was fortunate for myself, who am, to a\ncertain extent, a philologist, that with me the pursuit of languages has\nbeen always modified by the love of horses; for scarcely had I turned my\nmind to the former, when I also mounted the wild cob, and hurried forth\nin the direction of the Devil's Hill, scattering dust and flint-stones on\nevery side; that ride, amongst other things, taught me that a lad with\nthews and sinews was intended by nature for something better than mere\nword-culling; and if I have accomplished anything in after life worthy of\nmentioning, I believe it may partly be attributed to the ideas which that\nride, by setting my blood in a glow, infused into my brain.  I might,\notherwise, have become a mere philologist; one of those beings who toil\nnight and day in culling useless words for some _opus magnum_ which\nMurray will never publish, and nobody ever read; beings without\nenthusiasm, who, having never mounted a generous steed, cannot detect a\ngood point in Pegasus himself; like a certain philologist, who, though\nacquainted with the exact value of every word in the Greek and Latin\nlanguages, could observe no particular beauty in one of the most glorious\nof Homer's rhapsodies.  What knew he of Pegasus? he had never mounted a\ngenerous steed; the merest jockey, had the strain been interpreted to\nhim, would have called it a brave song!--I return to the brave cob.\n\nOn a certain day I had been out on an excursion.  In a cross-road, at\nsome distance from the Satanic hill, the animal which I rode cast a shoe.\nBy good luck a small village was at hand, at the entrance of which was a\nlarge shed, from which proceeded a most furious noise of hammering.\nLeading the cob by the bridle, I entered boldly.  'Shoe this horse, and\ndo it quickly, a gough,' said I to a wild grimy figure of a man, whom I\nfound alone, fashioning a piece of iron.\n\n'Arrigod yuit?' said the fellow, desisting from his work, and staring at\nme.\n\n'Oh yes, I have money,' said I, 'and of the best'; and I pulled out an\nEnglish shilling.\n\n'Tabhair chugam?' said the smith, stretching out his grimy hand.\n\n'No, I shan't,' said I; 'some people are glad to get their money when\ntheir work is done.'\n\nThe fellow hammered a little longer, and then proceeded to shoe the cob,\nafter having first surveyed it with attention.  He performed his job\nrather roughly, and more than once appeared to give the animal\nunnecessary pain, frequently making use of loud and boisterous words.  By\nthe time the work was done, the creature was in a state of high\nexcitement, and plunged and tore.  The smith stood at a short distance,\nseeming to enjoy the irritation of the animal, and showing, in a\nremarkable manner, a huge fang, which projected from the under jaw of a\nvery wry mouth.\n\n'You deserve better handling,' said I, as I went up to the cob and\nfondled it; whereupon it whinnied, and attempted to touch my face with\nits nose.\n\n{picture:'Arrigod yuit?' said the fellow, desisting from his work, and\nstaring at me: page94.jpg}\n\n'Are ye not afraid of that beast?' said the smith, showing his fang.\n'Arrah, it's vicious that he looks!'\n\n'It's at you, then!--I don't fear him'; and thereupon I passed under the\nhorse, between its hind legs.\n\n'And is that all you can do, agrah?' said the smith.\n\n'No,' said I, 'I can ride him.'\n\n'Ye can ride him, and what else, agrah?'\n\n'I can leap him over a six-foot wall,' said I.\n\n'Over a wall, and what more, agrah?'\n\n'Nothing more,' said I; 'what more would you have?'\n\n'Can you do this, agrah?' said the smith; and he uttered a word which I\nhad never heard before, in a sharp pungent tone.  The effect upon myself\nwas somewhat extraordinary, a strange thrill ran through me; but with\nregard to the cob it was terrible; the animal forthwith became like one\nmad, and reared and kicked with the utmost desperation.\n\n'Can you do that, agrah?' said the smith.\n\n'What is it?' said I, retreating, 'I never saw the horse so before.'\n\n'Go between his legs, agrah,' said the smith, 'his hinder legs'; and he\nagain showed his fang.\n\n'I dare not,' said I, 'he would kill me.'\n\n'He would kill ye! and how do ye know that, agrah?'\n\n'I feel he would,' said I, 'something tells me so.'\n\n'And it tells ye truth, agrah; but it's a fine beast, and it's a pity to\nsee him in such a state: Is agam an't leigeas'--and here he uttered\nanother word in a voice singularly modified, but sweet and almost\nplaintive; the effect of it was as instantaneous as that of the other,\nbut how different!--the animal lost all its fury, and became at once calm\nand gentle.  The smith went up to it, coaxed and patted it, making use of\nvarious sounds of equine endearment; then turning to me, and holding out\nonce more the grimy hand, he said, 'And now ye will be giving me the\nSassannach tenpence, agrah?'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\nA fine old city--Norman master-work--Lollards' Hole--Good blood--The\nSpaniard's sword--Old retired officer--Writing to a duke--God help the\nchild--Nothing like Jacob--Irish brigades--Old Sergeant Meredith--I have\nbeen young--Idleness--Only course open--The bookstall--A portrait--A\nbanished priest.\n\nFrom the wild scenes which I have attempted to describe in the latter\npages I must now transport the reader to others of a widely different\ncharacter.  He must suppose himself no longer in Ireland, but in the\neastern corner of merry England.  Bogs, ruins, and mountains have\ndisappeared amidst the vapours of the west: I have nothing more to say of\nthem; the region in which we are now is not famous for objects of that\nkind: perhaps it flatters itself that it can produce fairer and better\nthings, of some of which let me speak; there is a fine old city before\nus, and first of that let me speak.\n\nA fine old city, truly, is that, view it from whatever side you will; but\nit shows best from the east, where the ground, bold and elevated,\noverlooks the fair and fertile valley in which it stands.  Gazing from\nthose heights, the eye beholds a scene which cannot fail to awaken, even\nin the least sensitive bosom, feelings of pleasure and admiration.  At\nthe foot of the heights flows a narrow and deep river, with an antique\nbridge communicating with a long and narrow suburb, flanked on either\nside by rich meadows of the brightest green, beyond which spreads the\ncity; the fine old city, perhaps the most curious specimen at present\nextant of the genuine old English town.  Yes, there it spreads from north\nto south, with its venerable houses, its numerous gardens, its thrice\ntwelve churches, its mighty mound, which, if tradition speaks true, was\nraised by human hands to serve as the grave-heap of an old heathen king,\nwho sits deep within it, with his sword in his hand, and his gold and\nsilver treasures about him.  There is a gray old castle upon the top of\nthat mighty mound; and yonder, rising three hundred feet above the soil,\nfrom among those noble forest trees, behold that old Norman master-work,\nthat cloud-encircled cathedral spire, around which a garrulous army of\nrooks and choughs continually wheel their flight.  Now, who can wonder\nthat the children of that fine old city are proud of her, and offer up\nprayers for her prosperity?  I, myself, who was not born within her\nwalls, offer up prayers for her prosperity, that want may never visit her\ncottages, vice her palaces, and that the abomination of idolatry may\nnever pollute her temples.  Ha, idolatry! the reign of idolatry has been\nover there for many a long year, never more, let us hope, to return;\nbrave hearts in that old town have borne witness against it, and sealed\ntheir testimony with their hearts' blood--most precious to the Lord is\nthe blood of His saints! we are not far from hallowed ground.  Observe ye\nnot yon chalky precipice, to the right of the Norman bridge?  On this\nside of the stream, upon its brow, is a piece of ruined wall, the last\nrelic of what was of old a stately pile, whilst at its foot is a place\ncalled the Lollards' Hole; and with good reason, for many a saint of God\nhas breathed his last beneath that white precipice, bearing witness\nagainst popish idolatry, midst flame and pitch; many a grisly procession\nhas advanced along that suburb, across the old bridge, towards the\nLollards' Hole: furious priests in front, a calm pale martyr in the\nmidst, a pitying multitude behind.  It has had its martyrs, the venerable\nold town!\n\nAh! there is good blood in that old city, and in the whole circumjacent\nregion of which it is the capital.  The Angles possessed the land at an\nearly period, which, however, they were eventually compelled to share\nwith hordes of Danes and Northmen, who flocked thither across the sea to\nfound hearthsteads on its fertile soil.  The present race, a mixture of\nAngles and Danes, still preserve much which speaks strongly of their\nnorthern ancestry; amongst them ye will find the light-brown hair of the\nnorth, the strong and burly forms of the north, many a wild superstition,\nay, and many a wild name connected with the ancient history of the north\nand its sublime mythology; the warm heart and the strong heart of the old\nDanes and Saxons still beats in those regions, and there ye will find, if\nanywhere, old northern hospitality and kindness of manner, united with\nenergy, perseverance, and dauntless intrepidity; better soldiers or\nmariners never bled in their country's battles than those nurtured in\nthose regions, and within those old walls.  It was yonder, to the west,\nthat the great naval hero of Britain first saw the light; he who\nannihilated the sea pride of Spain, and dragged the humbled banner of\nFrance in triumph at his stem.  He was born yonder, towards the west, and\nof him there is a glorious relic in that old town; in its dark flint\nguildhouse, the roof of which you can just descry rising above that maze\nof buildings, in the upper hall of justice, is a species of glass shrine,\nin which the relic is to be seen; a sword of curious workmanship, the\nblade is of keen Toledan steel, the heft of ivory and mother-of-pearl.\n'Tis the sword of Cordova, won in bloodiest fray off Saint Vincent's\npromontory, and presented by Nelson to the old capital of the much-loved\nland of his birth.  Yes, the proud Spaniard's sword is to be seen in\nyonder guildhouse, in the glass case affixed to the wall: many other\nrelics has the good old town, but none prouder than the Spaniard's sword.\n\nSuch was the place to which, when the war was over, my father retired: it\nwas here that the old tired soldier set himself down with his little\nfamily.  He had passed the greater part of his life in meritorious\nexertion, in the service of his country, and his chief wish now was to\nspend the remainder of his days in quiet and respectability; his means,\nit is true, were not very ample; fortunate it was that his desires\ncorresponded with them; with a small fortune of his own, and with his\nhalf-pay as a royal soldier, he had no fears for himself or for his\nfaithful partner and helpmate; but then his children! how was he to\nprovide for them? how launch them upon the wide ocean of the world?  This\nwas, perhaps, the only thought which gave him uneasiness, and I believe\nthat many an old retired officer at that time, and under similar\ncircumstances, experienced similar anxiety; had the war continued, their\nchildren would have been, of course, provided for in the army, but peace\nnow reigned, and the military career was closed to all save the scions of\nthe aristocracy, or those who were in some degree connected with that\nprivileged order, an advantage which few of these old officers could\nboast of; they had slight influence with the great, who gave themselves\nvery little trouble either about them or their families.\n\n'I have been writing to the Duke,' said my father one day to my excellent\nmother, after we had been at home somewhat better than a year.  'I have\nbeen writing to the Duke of York about a commission for that eldest boy\nof ours.  He, however, affords me no hopes; he says that his list is\ncrammed with names, and that the greater number of the candidates have\nbetter claims than my son.'\n\n'I do not see how that can be,' said my mother.\n\n'Nor do I,' replied my father.  'I see the sons of bankers and merchants\ngazetted every month, and I do not see what claims they have to urge,\nunless they be golden ones.  However, I have not served my king fifty\nyears to turn grumbler at this time of life.  I suppose that the people\nat the head of affairs know what is most proper and convenient; perhaps\nwhen the lad sees how difficult, nay, how impossible it is that he should\nenter the army, he will turn his mind to some other profession; I wish he\nmay!'\n\n'I think he has already,' said my mother; 'you see how fond he is of the\narts, of drawing and painting, and, as far as I can judge, what he has\nalready done is very respectable; his mind seems quite turned that way,\nand I heard him say the other day that he would sooner be a Michael\nAngelo than a general officer.  But you are always talking of him; what\ndo you think of doing with the other child?'\n\n'What, indeed!' said my father; 'that is a consideration which gives me\nno little uneasiness.  I am afraid it will be much more difficult to\nsettle him in life than his brother.  What is he fitted for, even were it\nin my power to provide for him?  God help the child!  I bear him no ill\nwill, on the contrary, all love and affection; but I cannot shut my eyes;\nthere is something so strange about him!  How he behaved in Ireland!  I\nsent him to school to learn Greek, and he picked up Irish!'\n\n'And Greek as well,' said my mother.  'I heard him say the other day that\nhe could read St. John in the original tongue.'\n\n'You will find excuses for him, I know,' said my father.  'You tell me I\nam always talking of my first-born; I might retort by saying you are\nalways thinking of the other: but it is the way of women always to side\nwith the second-born.  There's what's her name in the Bible, by whose\nwiles the old blind man was induced to give to his second son the\nblessing which was the birthright of the other.  I wish I had been in his\nplace!  I should not have been so easily deceived! no disguise would ever\nhave caused me to mistake an impostor for my first-born.  Though I must\nsay for this boy that he is nothing like Jacob; he is neither smooth nor\nsleek, and, though my second-born, is already taller and larger than his\nbrother.'\n\n'Just so,' said my mother; 'his brother would make a far better Jacob\nthan he.'\n\n'I will hear nothing against my first-born,' said my father, 'even in the\nway of insinuation: he is my joy and pride; the very image of myself in\nmy youthful days, long before I fought Big Ben; though perhaps not quite\nso tall or strong built.  As for the other, God bless the child!  I love\nhim, I'm sure; but I must be blind not to see the difference between him\nand his brother.  Why, he has neither my hair nor my eyes; and then his\ncountenance! why, 'tis absolutely swarthy, God forgive me!  I had almost\nsaid like that of a gypsy, but I have nothing to say against that; the\nboy is not to be blamed for the colour of his face, nor for his hair and\neyes; but, then, his ways and manners!--I confess I do not like them, and\nthat they give me no little uneasiness--I know that he kept very strange\ncompany when he was in Ireland; people of evil report, of whom terrible\nthings were said--horse-witches and the like.  I questioned him once or\ntwice upon the matter, and even threatened him, but it was of no use; he\nput on a look as if he did not understand me, a regular Irish look, just\nsuch a one as those rascals assume when they wish to appear all innocence\nand simplicity, and they full of malice and deceit all the time.  I don't\nlike them; they are no friends to old England, or its old king, God bless\nhim!  They are not good subjects, and never were; always in league with\nforeign enemies.  When I was in the Coldstream, long before the\nRevolution, I used to hear enough about the Irish brigades kept by the\nFrench kings, to be a thorn in the side of the English whenever\nopportunity served.  Old Sergeant Meredith once told me that in the time\nof the Pretender there were always, in London alone, a dozen of fellows\nconnected with these brigades, with the view of seducing the king's\nsoldiers from their allegiance, and persuading them to desert to France\nto join the honest Irish, as they were called.  One of these traitors\nonce accosted him and proposed the matter to him, offering handfuls of\ngold if he could induce any of his comrades to go over.  Meredith\nappeared to consent, but secretly gave information to his colonel; the\nfellow was seized, and certain traitorous papers found upon him; he was\nhanged before Newgate, and died exulting in his treason.  His name was\nMichael Nowlan.  That ever son of mine should have been intimate with the\nPapist Irish, and have learnt their language!'\n\n'But he thinks of other things now,' said my mother.\n\n'Other languages, you mean,' said my father.  'It is strange that he has\nconceived such a zest for the study of languages; no sooner did he come\nhome than he persuaded me to send him to that old priest to learn French\nand Italian, and, if I remember right, you abetted him; but, as I said\nbefore, it is in the nature of women invariably to take the part of the\nsecond-born.  Well, there is no harm in learning French and Italian,\nperhaps much good in his case, as they may drive the other tongue out of\nhis head.  Irish! why, he might go to the university but for that; but\nhow would he look when, on being examined with respect to his\nattainments, it was discovered that he understood Irish?  How did you\nlearn it? they would ask him; how did you become acquainted with the\nlanguage of Papists and rebels?  The boy would be sent away in disgrace.'\n\n'Be under no apprehension, I have no doubt that he has long since\nforgotten it.'\n\n'I am glad to hear it,' said my father; 'for, between ourselves, I love\nthe poor child; ay, quite as well as my first-born.  I trust they will do\nwell, and that God will be their shield and guide; I have no doubt He\nwill, for I have read something in the Bible to that effect.  What is\nthat text about the young ravens being fed?'\n\n'I know a better than that,' said my mother; 'one of David's own words,\n\"I have been young and now am grown old, yet never have I seen the\nrighteous man forsaken, or his seed begging their bread.\"'\n\nI have heard talk of the pleasures of idleness, yet it is my own firm\nbelief that no one ever yet took pleasure in it.  Mere idleness is the\nmost disagreeable state of existence, and both mind and body are\ncontinually making efforts to escape from it.  It has been said that\nidleness is the parent of mischief, which is very true; but mischief\nitself is merely an attempt to escape from the dreary vacuum of idleness.\nThere are many tasks and occupations which a man is unwilling to perform,\nbut let no one think that he is therefore in love with idleness; he turns\nto something which is more agreeable to his inclination, and doubtless\nmore suited to his nature; but he is not in love with idleness.  A boy\nmay play the truant from school because he dislikes books and study; but,\ndepend upon it, he intends doing something the while--to go fishing, or\nperhaps to take a walk; and who knows but that from such excursions both\nhis mind and body may derive more benefit than from books and school?\nMany people go to sleep to escape from idleness; the Spaniards do; and,\naccording to the French account, John Bull, the 'squire, hangs himself in\nthe month of November; but the French, who are a very sensible people,\nattribute the action _a une grande envie de se desennuyer_; he wishes to\nbe doing something, say they, and having nothing better to do, he has\nrecourse to the cord.\n\nIt was for want of something better to do that, shortly after my return\nhome, I applied myself to the study of languages.  By the acquisition of\nIrish, with the first elements of which I had become acquainted under the\ntuition of Murtagh, I had contracted a certain zest and inclination for\nthe pursuit.  Yet it is probable that had I been launched about this time\ninto some agreeable career, that of arms for example, for which, being\nthe son of a soldier, I had, as was natural, a sort of penchant, I might\nhave thought nothing more of the acquisition of tongues of any kind; but,\nhaving nothing to do, I followed the only course suited to my genius\nwhich appeared open to me.\n\nSo it came to pass that one day, whilst wandering listlessly about the\nstreets of the old town, I came to a small book-stall, and stopping,\ncommenced turning over the books; I took up at least a dozen, and almost\ninstantly flung them down.  What were they to me?  At last, coming to a\nthick volume, I opened it, and after inspecting its contents for a few\nminutes, I paid for it what was demanded, and forthwith carried it home.\n\nIt was a tessaraglot grammar; a strange old book, printed somewhere in\nHolland, which pretended to be an easy guide to the acquirement of the\nFrench, Italian, Low Dutch, and English tongues, by means of which any\none conversant in any one of these languages could make himself master of\nthe other three.  I turned my attention to the French and Italian.  The\nold book was not of much value; I derived some benefit from it, however,\nand, conning it intensely, at the end of a few weeks obtained some\ninsight into the structure of these two languages.  At length I had\nlearnt all that the book was capable of informing me, yet was still far\nfrom the goal to which it had promised to conduct me.  'I wish I had a\nmaster!' I exclaimed; and the master was at hand.  In an old court of the\nold town lived a certain elderly personage, perhaps sixty, or\nthereabouts; he was rather tall, and something of a robust make, with a\ncountenance in which bluffness was singularly blended with vivacity and\ngrimace; and with a complexion which would have been ruddy, but for a\nyellow hue which rather predominated.  His dress consisted of a snuff-\ncoloured coat and drab pantaloons, the former evidently seldom subjected\nto the annoyance of a brush, and the latter exhibiting here and there\nspots of something which, if not grease, bore a strong resemblance to it;\nadd to these articles an immense frill, seldom of the purest white, but\ninvariably of the finest French cambric, and you have some idea of his\ndress.  He had rather a remarkable stoop, but his step was rapid and\nvigorous, and as he hurried along the streets, he would glance to the\nright and left with a pair of big eyes like plums, and on recognising any\none would exalt a pair of grizzled eyebrows, and slightly kiss a tawny\nand ungloved hand.  At certain hours of the day be might be seen entering\nthe doors of female boarding-schools, generally with a book in his hand,\nand perhaps another just peering from the orifice of a capacious back\npocket; and at a certain season of the year he might be seen, dressed in\nwhite, before the altar of a certain small popish chapel, chanting from\nthe breviary in very intelligible Latin, or perhaps reading from the desk\nin utterly unintelligible English.  Such was my preceptor in the French\nand Italian tongues.  'Exul sacerdos; vone banished priest.  I came into\nEngland twenty-five year ago, \"my dear.\"'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\nMonsieur Dante--Condemned musket--Sporting--Sweet rivulet--The Earl's\nHome--The pool--The sonorous voice--What dost thou read?--Man of\npeace--Zohar and Mishna--Money-changers.\n\nSo I studied French and Italian under the tuition of the banished priest,\nto whose house I went regularly every evening to receive instruction.  I\nmade considerable progress in the acquisition of the two languages.  I\nfound the French by far the most difficult, chiefly on account of the\naccent, which my master himself possessed in no great purity, being a\nNorman by birth.  The Italian was my favourite.\n\n'Vous serez un jour un grand philologue, mon cher,' said the old man, on\nour arriving at the conclusion of Dante's Hell.\n\n'I hope I shall be something better,' said I, 'before I die, or I shall\nhave lived to little purpose.'\n\n'That's true, my dear! philologist--one small poor dog.  What would you\nwish to be?'\n\n'Many things sooner than that; for example, I would rather be like him\nwho wrote this book.'\n\n'Quoi, Monsieur Dante?  He was a vagabond, my dear, forced to fly from\nhis country.  No, my dear, if you would be like one poet, be like\nMonsieur Boileau; he is the poet.'\n\n'I don't think so.'\n\n'How, not think so?  He wrote very respectable verses; lived and died\nmuch respected by everybody.  T'other, one bad dog, forced to fly from\nhis country--died with not enough to pay his undertaker.'\n\n'Were you not forced to flee from your country?'\n\n'That very true; but there is much difference between me and this Dante.\nHe fled from country because he had one bad tongue which he shook at his\nbetters.  I fly because benefice gone, and head going; not on account of\nthe badness of my tongue.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'you can return now; the Bourbons are restored.'\n\n'I find myself very well here; not bad country.  Il est vrai que la\nFrance sera toujours la France; but all are dead there who knew me.  I\nfind myself very well here.  Preach in popish chapel, teach schismatic,\nthat is Protestant, child tongues and literature.  I find myself very\nwell; and why?  Because I know how to govern my tongue; never call people\nhard names.  Ma foi, il y a beaucoup de difference entre moi et ce sacre\nde Dante.'\n\nUnder this old man, who was well versed in the southern languages,\nbesides studying French and Italian, I acquired some knowledge of\nSpanish.  But I did not devote my time entirely to philology; I had other\npursuits.  I had not forgotten the roving life I had led in former days,\nnor its delights; neither was I formed by Nature to be a pallid indoor\nstudent.  No, no!  I was fond of other and, I say it boldly, better\nthings than study.  I had an attachment to the angle, ay, and to the gun\nlikewise.  In our house was a condemned musket, bearing somewhere on its\nlock, in rather antique characters, 'Tower, 1746'; with this weapon I had\nalready, in Ireland, performed some execution among the rooks and\nchoughs, and it was now again destined to be a source of solace and\namusement to me, in the winter season, especially on occasions of severe\nfrost when birds abounded.  Sallying forth with it at these times, far\ninto the country, I seldom returned at night without a string of\nbullfinches, blackbirds, and linnets hanging in triumph round my neck.\nWhen I reflect on the immense quantity of powder and shot which I crammed\ndown the muzzle of my uncouth fowling-piece, I am less surprised at the\nnumber of birds which I slaughtered than that I never blew my hands,\nface, and old honeycombed gun, it one and the same time, to pieces.\n\nBut the winter, alas! (I speak as a fowler) seldom lasts in England more\nthan three or four months; so, during the rest of the year, when not\noccupied with my philological studies, I had to seek for other\ndiversions.  I have already given a hint that I was also addicted to the\nangle.  Of course there is no comparison between the two pursuits, the\nrod and line seeming but very poor trumpery to one who has had the honour\nof carrying a noble firelock.  There is a time, however, for all things;\nand we return to any favourite amusement with the greater zest, from\nbeing compelled to relinquish it for a season.  So, if I shot birds in\nwinter with my firelock, I caught fish in summer, or attempted so to do,\nwith my angle.  I was not quite so successful, it is true, with the\nlatter as with the former; possibly because it afforded me less pleasure.\nIt was, indeed, too much of a listless pastime to inspire me with any\ngreat interest.  I not unfrequently fell into a doze, whilst sitting on\nthe bank, and more than once let my rod drop from my hands into the\nwater.\n\nAt some distance from the city, behind a range of hilly ground which\nrises towards the south-west, is a small river, the waters of which,\nafter many meanderings, eventually enter the principal river of the\ndistrict, and assist to swell the tide which it rolls down to the ocean.\nIt is a sweet rivulet, and pleasant is it to trace its course from its\nspring-head, high up in the remote regions of Eastern Anglia, till it\narrives in the valley behind yon rising ground; and pleasant is that\nvalley, truly a goodly spot, but most lovely where yonder bridge crosses\nthe little stream.  Beneath its arch the waters rush garrulously into a\nblue pool, and are there stilled, for a time, for the pool is deep, and\nthey appear to have sunk to sleep.  Farther on, however, you hear their\nvoice again, where they ripple gaily over yon gravelly shallow.  On the\nleft, the hill slopes gently down to the margin of the stream.  On the\nright is a green level, a smiling meadow, grass of the richest decks the\nside of the slope; mighty trees also adorn it, giant elms, the nearest of\nwhich, when the sun is nigh its meridian, fling a broad shadow upon the\nface of the pool; through yon vista you catch a glimpse of the ancient\nbrick of an old English hall.  It has a stately look, that old building,\nindistinctly seen, as it is, among those umbrageous trees; you might\nalmost suppose it an earl's home; and such it was, or rather upon its\nsite stood an earl's home, in days of old, for there some old Kemp, some\nSigurd or Thorkild, roaming in quest of a hearthstead, settled down in\nthe gray old time, when Thor and Freya were yet gods, and Odin was a\nportentous name.  Yon old hall is still called the Earl's Home, though\nthe hearth of Sigurd is now no more, and the bones of the old Kemp, and\nof Sigrith his dame, have been mouldering for a thousand years in some\nneighbouring knoll; perhaps yonder, where those tall Norwegian pines\nshoot up so boldly into the air.  It is said that the old earl's galley\nwas once moored where is now that blue pool, for the waters of that\nvalley were not always sweet; yon valley was once an arm of the sea, a\nsalt lagoon, to which the war-barks of 'Sigurd, in search of a home,'\nfound their way.\n\nI was in the habit of spending many an hour on the banks of that rivulet,\nwith my rod in my hand, and, when tired with angling, would stretch\nmyself on the grass, and gaze upon the waters as they glided past, and\nnot unfrequently, divesting myself of my dress, I would plunge into the\ndeep pool which I have already mentioned, for I had long since learned to\nswim.  And it came to pass that on one hot summer's day, after bathing in\nthe pool, I passed along the meadow till I came to a shallow part, and,\nwading over to the opposite side, I adjusted my dress, and commenced\nfishing in another pool, beside which was a small clump of hazels.\n\nAnd there I sat upon the bank, at the bottom of the hill which slopes\ndown from 'the Earl's home'; my float was on the waters, and my back was\ntowards the old hall.  I drew up many fish, small and great, which I took\nfrom off the hook mechanically, and flung upon the bank, for I was almost\nunconscious of what I was about, for my mind was not with my fish.  I was\nthinking of my earlier years--of the Scottish crags and the heaths of\nIreland--and sometimes my mind would dwell on my studies--on the sonorous\nstanzas of Dante, rising and falling like the waves of the sea--or would\nstrive to remember a couplet or two of poor Monsieur Boileau.\n\n'Canst thou answer to thy conscience for pulling all those fish out of\nthe water, and leaving them to gasp in the sun?' said a voice, clear and\nsonorous as a bell.\n\nI started, and looked round.  Close behind me stood the tall figure of a\nman, dressed in raiment of quaint and singular fashion, but of goodly\nmaterials.  He was in the prime and vigour of manhood; his features\nhandsome and noble, but full of calmness and benevolence; at least I\nthought so, though they were somewhat shaded by a hat of finest beaver,\nwith broad drooping eaves.\n\n'Surely that is a very cruel diversion in which thou indulgest, my young\nfriend?' he continued.\n\n'I am sorry for it, if it be, sir,' said I, rising; 'but I do not think\nit cruel to fish.'\n\n'What are thy reasons for not thinking so?'\n\n'Fishing is mentioned frequently in Scripture.  Simon Peter was a\nfisherman.'\n\n'True; and Andrew and his brother.  But thou forgettest: they did not\nfollow fishing as a diversion, as I fear thou doest.--Thou readest the\nScriptures?'\n\n'Sometimes.'\n\n'Sometimes?--not daily?--that is to be regretted.  What profession dost\nthou make?--I mean to what religious denomination dost thou belong, my\nyoung friend.'\n\n'Church?'\n\n'It is a very good profession--there is much of Scripture contained in\nits liturgy.  Dost thou read aught besides the Scriptures?'\n\n'Sometimes.'\n\n'What dost thou read besides?'\n\n'Greek, and Dante.'\n\n'Indeed! then thou hast the advantage over myself; I can only read the\nformer.  Well, I am rejoiced to find that thou hast other pursuits beside\nthy fishing.  Dost thou know Hebrew?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Thou shouldst study it.  Why dost thou not undertake the study?'\n\n'I have no books.'\n\n'I will lend thee books, if thou wish to undertake the study.  I live\nyonder at the hall, as perhaps thou knowest.  I have a library there, in\nwhich are many curious books, both in Greek and Hebrew, which I will show\nto thee, whenever thou mayest find it convenient to come and see me.\nFarewell!  I am glad to find that thou hast pursuits more satisfactory\nthan thy cruel fishing.'\n\nAnd the man of peace departed, and left me on the bank of the stream.\nWhether from the effect of his words, or from want of inclination to the\nsport, I know not, but from that day I became less and less a\npractitioner of that 'cruel fishing.'  I rarely flung line and angle into\nthe water, but I not unfrequently wandered by the banks of the pleasant\nrivulet.  It seems singular to me, on reflection, that I never availed\nmyself of his kind invitation.  I say singular, for the extraordinary,\nunder whatever form, had long had no slight interest for me; and I had\ndiscernment enough to perceive that yon was no common man.  Yet I went\nnot near him, certainly not from bashfulness or timidity, feelings to\nwhich I had long been an entire stranger.  Am I to regret this? perhaps,\nfor I might have learned both wisdom and righteousness from those calm,\nquiet lips, and my after-course might have been widely different.  As it\nwas, I fell in with other guess companions, from whom I received widely\ndifferent impressions than those I might have derived from him.  When\nmany years had rolled on, long after I had attained manhood, and had seen\nand suffered much, and when our first interview had long since been\neffaced from the mind of the man of peace, I visited him in his venerable\nhall, and partook of the hospitality of his hearth.  And there I saw his\ngentle partner and his fair children, and on the morrow he showed me the\nbooks of which he had spoken years before by the side of the stream.  In\nthe low quiet chamber, whose one window, shaded by a gigantic elm, looks\ndown the slope towards the pleasant stream, he took from the shelf his\nlearned books, Zohar and Mishna, Toldoth Jesu and Abarbenel.  'I am fond\nof these studies,' said he, 'which, perhaps, is not to be wondered at,\nseeing that our people have been compared to the Jews.  In one respect I\nconfess we are similar to them; we are fond of getting money.  I do not\nlike this last author, this Abarbenel, the worse for having been a money-\nchanger.  I am a banker myself, as thou knowest.'\n\nAnd would there were many like him, amidst the money-changers of princes!\nThe hall of many an earl lacks the bounty, the palace of many a prelate\nthe piety and learning, which adorn the quiet quaker's home!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\nFair of horses--Looks of respect--The fast trotter--Pair of eyes--Strange\nmen--Jasper, your pal--Force of blood--Young lady with diamonds--Not\nquite so beautiful.\n\nI was standing on the castle hill in the midst of a fair of horses.\n\nI have already had occasion to mention this castle.  It is the remains of\nwhat was once a Norman stronghold, and is perched upon a round mound or\nmonticle, in the midst of the old city.  Steep is this mound and scarped,\nevidently by the hand of man; a deep gorge over which is flung a bridge,\nseparates it, on the south, from a broad swell of open ground called 'the\nhill'; of old the scene of many a tournament and feat of Norman chivalry,\nbut now much used as a show-place for cattle, where those who buy and\nsell beeves and other beasts resort at stated periods.\n\nSo it came to pass that I stood upon this hill, observing a fair of\nhorses.\n\nThe reader is already aware that I had long since conceived a passion for\nthe equine race; a passion in which circumstances had of late not\npermitted me to indulge.  I had no horses to ride, but I took pleasure in\nlooking at them; and I had already attended more than one of these fairs:\nthe present was lively enough, indeed horse fairs are seldom dull.  There\nwas shouting and whooping, neighing and braying; there was galloping and\ntrotting; fellows with highlows and white stockings, and with many a\nstring dangling from the knees of their tight breeches, were running\ndesperately, holding horses by the halter, and in some cases dragging\nthem along; there were long-tailed steeds and dock-tailed steeds of every\ndegree and breed; there were droves of wild ponies, and long rows of\nsober cart horses; there were donkeys, and even mules: the last rare\nthings to be seen in damp, misty England, for the mule pines in mud and\nrain, and thrives best with a hot sun above and a burning sand below.\nThere were--oh, the gallant creatures!  I hear their neigh upon the wind;\nthere were--goodliest sight of all--certain enormous quadrupeds only seen\nto perfection in our native isle, led about by dapper grooms, their manes\nribanded and their tails curiously clubbed and balled.  Ha! ha!--how\ndistinctly do they say, ha! ha!\n\nAn old man draws nigh, he is mounted on a lean pony, and he leads by the\nbridle one of these animals; nothing very remarkable about that creature,\nunless in being smaller than the rest and gentle, which they are not; he\nis not of the sightliest look; he is almost dun, and over one eye a thick\nfilm has gathered.  But stay! there _is_ something remarkable about that\nhorse, there is something in his action in which he differs from all the\nrest: as he advances, the clamour is hushed! all eyes are turned upon\nhim--what looks of interest--of respect--and, what is this? people are\ntaking off their hats--surely not to that steed!  Yes, verily! men,\nespecially old men, are taking off their hats to that one-eyed steed, and\nI hear more than one deep-drawn ah!\n\n'What horse is that?' said I to a very old fellow, the counterpart of the\nold man on the pony, save that the last wore a faded suit of velveteen,\nand this one was dressed in a white frock.\n\n'The best in mother England,' said the very old man, taking a knobbed\nstick from his mouth, and looking me in the face, at first carelessly,\nbut presently with something like interest; 'he is old like myself, but\ncan still trot his twenty miles an hour.  You won't live long, my swain;\ntall and over-grown ones like thee never does; yet, if you should chance\nto reach my years, you may boast to thy great-grand-boys thou hast seen\nMarshland Shales.'\n\nAmain I did for the horse what I would neither do for earl nor baron,\ndoffed my hat; yes! I doffed my hat to the wondrous horse, the fast\ntrotter, the best in mother England; and I too drew a deep ah! and\nrepeated the words of the old fellows around.  'Such a horse as this we\nshall never see again; a pity that he is so old.'\n\nNow during all this time I had a kind of consciousness that I had been\nthe object of some person's observation; that eyes were fastened upon me\nfrom somewhere in the crowd.  Sometimes I thought myself watched from\nbefore, sometimes from behind; and occasionally methought that, if I just\nturned my head to the right or left, I should meet a peering and\ninquiring glance; and indeed once or twice I did turn, expecting to see\nsomebody whom I knew, yet always without success; though it appeared to\nme that I was but a moment too late, and that some one had just slipped\naway from the direction to which I turned, like the figure in a magic\nlanthorn.  Once I was quite sure that there were a pair of eyes glaring\nover my right shoulder; my attention, however, was so fully occupied with\nthe objects which I have attempted to describe, that I thought very\nlittle of this coming and going, this flitting and dodging of I knew not\nwhom or what.  It was, after all, a matter of sheer indifference to me\nwho was looking at me.  I could only wish whomsoever it might be to be\nmore profitably employed; so I continued enjoying what I saw; and now\nthere was a change in the scene, the wondrous old horse departed with his\naged guardian; other objects of interest are at hand; two or three men on\nhorseback are hurrying through the crowd, they are widely different in\ntheir appearance from the other people of the fair; not so much in dress,\nfor they are clad something after the fashion of rustic jockeys, but in\ntheir look--no light-brown hair have they, no ruddy cheeks, no blue quiet\nglances belong to them; their features are dark, their locks long, black,\nand shining, and their eyes are wild; they are admirable horsemen, but\nthey do not sit the saddle in the manner of common jockeys, they seem to\nfloat or hover upon it, like gulls upon the waves; two of them are mere\nstriplings, but the third is a very tall man with a countenance\nheroically beautiful, but wild, wild, wild.  As they rush along, the\ncrowd give way on all sides, and now a kind of ring or circus is formed,\nwithin which the strange men exhibit their horsemanship, rushing past\neach other, in and out, after the manner of a reel, the tall man\noccasionally balancing himself upon the saddle, and standing erect on one\nfoot.  He had just regained his seat after the latter feat, and was about\nto push his horse to a gallop, when a figure started forward close from\nbeside me, and laying his hand on his neck, and pulling him gently\ndownward, appeared to whisper something into his ear; presently the tall\nman raised his head, and, scanning the crowd for a moment in the\ndirection in which I was standing, fixed his eyes full upon me, and anon\nthe countenance of the whisperer was turned, but only in part, and the\nside-glance of another pair of wild eyes was directed towards my face,\nbut the entire visage of the big black man, half stooping as he was, was\nturned full upon mine.\n\n{picture:A kind of ring or circus is formed, within which the strange men\nexhibit their horsemanship: page112.jpg}\n\nBut now, with a nod to the figure who had stopped him, and with another\ninquiring glance at myself, the big man once more put his steed into\nmotion, and, after riding round the ring a few more times, darted through\na lane in the crowd, and followed by his two companions disappeared,\nwhereupon the figure who had whispered to him, and had subsequently\nremained in the middle of the space, came towards me, and, cracking a\nwhip which he held in his hand so loudly that the report was nearly equal\nto that of a pocket pistol, he cried in a strange tone:\n\n'What! the sap-engro?  Lor! the sap-engro upon the hill!'\n\n'I remember that word,' said I, 'and I almost think I remember you.  You\ncan't be--'\n\n'Jasper, your pal!  Truth, and no lie, brother.'\n\n'It is strange that you should have known me,' said I.  'I am certain,\nbut for the word you used, I should never have recognised you.'\n\n'Not so strange as you may think, brother; there is something in your\nface which would prevent people from forgetting you, even though they\nmight wish it; and your face is not much altered since the time you wot\nof, though you are so much grown.  I thought it was you, but to make sure\nI dodged about, inspecting you.  I believe you felt me, though I never\ntouched you; a sign, brother, that we are akin, that we are dui palor--two\nrelations.  Your blood beat when mine was near, as mine always does at\nthe coming of a brother; and we became brothers in that lane.'\n\n'And where are you staying?' said I; 'in this town?'\n\n'Not in the town; the like of us don't find it exactly wholesome to stay\nin towns, we keep abroad.  But I have little to do here--come with me,\nand I'll show you where we stay.'\n\nWe descended the hill in the direction of the north, and passing along\nthe suburb reached the old Norman bridge, which we crossed; the chalk\nprecipice, with the ruin on its top, was now before us; but turning to\nthe left we walked swiftly along, and presently came to some rising\nground, which ascending, we found ourselves upon a wild moor or heath.\n\n'You are one of them,' said I, 'whom people call--'\n\n'Just so,' said Jasper; 'but never mind what people call us.'\n\n'And that tall handsome man on the hill, whom you whispered?  I suppose\nhe's one of ye.  What is his name?'\n\n'Tawno Chikno,' said Jasper, 'which means the small one; we call him such\nbecause he is the biggest man of all our nation.  You say he is handsome,\nthat is not the word, brother; he's the beauty of the world.  Women run\nwild at the sight of Tawno.  An earl's daughter, near London--a fine\nyoung lady with diamonds round her neck--fell in love with Tawno.  I have\nseen that lass on a heath, as this may be, kneel down to Tawno, clasp his\nfeet, begging to be his wife--or anything else--if she might go with him.\nBut Tawno would have nothing to do with her: \"I have a wife of my own,\"\nsaid he, \"a lawful rommany wife, whom I love better than the whole world,\njealous though she sometimes be.\"'\n\n'And is she very beautiful?' said I.\n\n'Why, you know, brother, beauty is frequently a matter of taste; however,\nas you ask my opinion, I should say not quite so beautiful as himself.'\n\n{picture:'There 'ere woman is Tawno Chikno's wife!': page115.jpg}\n\nWe had now arrived at a small valley between two hills, or downs, the\nsides of which were covered with furze; in the midst of this valley were\nvarious carts and low tents forming a rude kind of encampment; several\ndark children were playing about, who took no manner of notice of us.  As\nwe passed one of the tents, however, a canvas screen was lifted up, and a\nwoman supported upon a crutch hobbled out.  She was about the middle age,\nand, besides being lame, was bitterly ugly; she was very slovenly\ndressed, and on her swarthy features ill nature was most visibly stamped.\nShe did not deign me a look, but, addressing Jasper in a tongue which I\ndid not understand, appeared to put some eager questions to him.\n\n'He's coming,' said Jasper, and passed on.  'Poor fellow,' said he to me,\n'he has scarcely been gone an hour, and she's jealous already.  Well,' he\ncontinued, 'what do you think of her? you have seen her now, and can\njudge for yourself--that 'ere woman is Tawno Chikno's wife!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\n\nThe tent--Pleasant discourse--I am Pharaoh--Shifting for one's self\n--Horse-shoes--This is wonderful--Bless your wisdom--A pretty\nmanoeuvre--Ill day to the Romans--My name is Herne--Singular people--An\noriginal speech--Word-master--Speaking Romanly.\n\nWe went to the farthest of the tents, which stood at a slight distance\nfrom the rest, and which exactly resembled the one which I have described\non a former occasion; we went in and sat down one on each side of a small\nfire, which was smouldering on the ground, there was no one else in the\ntent but a tall tawny woman of middle age, who was busily knitting.\n'Brother,' said Jasper, 'I wish to hold some pleasant discourse with\nyou.'\n\n'As much as you please,' said I, 'provided you can find anything pleasant\nto talk about.'\n\n'Never fear,' said Jasper; 'and first of all we will talk of yourself.\nWhere have you been all this long time?'\n\n'Here and there,' said I, 'and far and near, going about with the\nsoldiers; but there is no soldiering now, so we have sat down, father and\nfamily, in the town there.'\n\n'And do you still hunt snakes?' said Jasper.\n\n'No,' said I, 'I have given up that long ago; I do better now: read books\nand learn languages.'\n\n'Well, I am sorry you have given up your snake-hunting, many's the\nstrange talk I have had with our people about your snake and yourself,\nand how you frightened my father and mother in the lane.'\n\n'And where are your father and mother?'\n\n'Where I shall never see them, brother; at least, I hope so.'\n\n'Not dead?'\n\n'No, not dead; they are bitchadey pawdel.'\n\n'What's that?'\n\n'Sent across--banished.'\n\n'Ah! I understand; I am sorry for them.  And so you are here alone?'\n\n'Not quite alone, brother.'\n\n'No, not alone; but with the rest--Tawno Chikno takes care of you.'\n\n'Takes care of me, brother!'\n\n'Yes, stands to you in the place of a father--keeps you out of harm's\nway.'\n\n'What do you take me for, brother?'\n\n'For about three years older than myself.'\n\n'Perhaps; but you are of the Gorgios, and I am a Rommany Chal.  Tawno\nChikno take care of Jasper Petulengro!'\n\n'Is that your name?'\n\n'Don't you like it?'\n\n'Very much, I never heard a sweeter; it is something like what you call\nme.'\n\n'The horse-shoe master and the snake-fellow, I am the first.'\n\n'Who gave you that name?'\n\n'Ask Pharaoh.'\n\n'I would, if he were here, but I do not see him.'\n\n'I am Pharaoh.'\n\n'Then you are a king.'\n\n'Chachipen Pal.'\n\n'I do not understand you.'\n\n'Where are your languages?  You want two things, brother: mother sense,\nand gentle Rommany.'\n\n'What makes you think that I want sense?'\n\n'That, being so old, you can't yet guide yourself!'\n\n'I can read Dante, Jasper.'\n\n'Anan, brother.'\n\n'I can charm snakes, Jasper.'\n\n'I know you can, brother.'\n\n'Yes, and horses too; bring me the most vicious in the land, if I whisper\nhe'll be tame.'\n\n'Then the more shame for you--a snake-fellow--a horse-witch--and a lil-\nreader--yet you can't shift for yourself.  I laugh at you, brother!'\n\n'Then you can shift for yourself?'\n\n'For myself and for others, brother.'\n\n'And what does Chikno?'\n\n'Sells me horses, when I bid him.  Those horses on the chong were mine.'\n\n'And has he none of his own?'\n\n'Sometimes he has; but he is not so well off as myself.  When my father\nand mother were bitchadey pawdel, which, to tell you the truth, they were\nfor chiving wafodo dloovu, they left me all they had, which was not a\nlittle, and I became the head of our family, which was not a small one.  I\nwas not older than you when that happened; yet our people said they had\nnever a better krallis to contrive and plan for them, and to keep them in\norder.  And this is so well known that many Rommany Chals, not of our\nfamily, come and join themselves to us, living with us for a time, in\norder to better themselves, more especially those of the poorer sort, who\nhave little of their own.  Tawno is one of these.'\n\n'Is that fine fellow poor?'\n\n'One of the poorest, brother.  Handsome as he is, he has not a horse of\nhis own to ride on.  Perhaps we may put it down to his wife, who cannot\nmove about, being a cripple, as you saw.'\n\n'And you are what is called a Gypsy King?'\n\n'Ay, ay; a Rommany Kral.'\n\n'Are there other kings?'\n\n'Those who call themselves so; but the true Pharaoh is Petulengro.'\n\n'Did Pharaoh make horse-shoes?'\n\n'The first who ever did, brother.'\n\n'Pharaoh lived in Egypt.'\n\n'So did we once, brother.'\n\n'And you left it?'\n\n'My fathers did, brother.'\n\n'And why did they come here?'\n\n'They had their reasons, brother.'\n\n'And you are not English?'\n\n'We are not gorgios.'\n\n'And you have a language of your own?'\n\n'Avali.'\n\n'This is wonderful.'\n\n'Ha, ha!' cried the woman, who had hitherto sat knitting, at the farther\nend of the tent, without saying a word, though not inattentive to our\nconversation, as I could perceive by certain glances which she\noccasionally cast upon us both.  'Ha, ha!' she screamed, fixing upon me\ntwo eyes, which shone like burning coals, and which were filled with an\nexpression both of scorn and malignity, 'It is wonderful, is it, that we\nshould have a language of our own?  What, you grudge the poor people the\nspeech they talk among themselves?  That's just like you gorgios; you\nwould have everybody stupid, single-tongued idiots, like yourselves.  We\nare taken before the Poknees of the gav, myself and sister, to give an\naccount of ourselves.  So I says to my sister's little boy, speaking\nRommany, I says to the little boy who is with us, Run to my son Jasper,\nand the rest, and tell them to be off, there are hawks abroad.  So the\nPoknees questions us, and lets us go, not being able to make anything of\nus; but, as we are going, he calls us back.  \"Good woman,\" says the\nPoknees, \"what was that I heard you say just now to the little boy?\"  \"I\nwas telling him, your worship, to go and see the time of day, and to save\ntrouble, I said it in our language.\"  \"Where did you get that language?\"\nsays the Poknees.  \"'Tis our own language, sir,\" I tells him, \"we did not\nsteal it.\"  \"Shall I tell you what it is, my good woman?\" says the\nPoknees.  \"I would thank you, sir,\" says I, \"for 'tis often we are asked\nabout it.\"  \"Well, then,\" says the Poknees, \"it is no language at all,\nmerely a made-up gibberish.\"  \"Oh, bless your wisdom,\" says I, with a\ncurtsey, \"you can tell us what our language is, without understanding\nit!\"  Another time we meet a parson.  \"Good woman,\" says he, \"what's that\nyou are talking?  Is it broken language?\"  \"Of course, your reverence,\"\nsays I, \"we are broken people; give a shilling, your reverence, to the\npoor broken woman.\"  Oh, these gorgios! they grudge us our very\nlanguage!'\n\n'She called you her son, Jasper?'\n\n'I am her son, brother.'\n\n'I thought you said your parents were--'\n\n'Bitchadey pawdel; you thought right, brother.  This is my wife's\nmother.'\n\n'Then you are married, Jasper?'\n\n'Ay, truly; I am husband and father.  You will see wife and chabo anon.'\n\n'Where are they now?'\n\n'In the gav, penning dukkerin.'\n\n'We were talking of language, Jasper?'\n\n'True, brother.'\n\n'Yours must be a rum one?'\n\n''Tis called Rommany.'\n\n'I would gladly know it.'\n\n'You need it sorely.'\n\n'Would you teach it me?'\n\n'None sooner.'\n\n'Suppose we begin now?'\n\n'Suppose we do, brother.'\n\n'Not whilst I am here,' said the woman, flinging her knitting down, and\nstarting upon her feet; 'not whilst I am here shall this gorgio learn\nRommany.  A pretty manoeuvre, truly; and what would be the end of it?  I\ngoes to the farming ker with my sister, to tell a fortune, and earn a few\nsixpences for the chabes.  I sees a jolly pig in the yard, and I says to\nmy sister, speaking Rommany, \"Do so and so,\" says I; which the farming\nman hearing, asks what we are talking about. \"Nothing at all, master,\"\nsays I; \"something about the weather\"; when who should start up from\nbehind a pale, where he has been listening, but this ugly gorgio, crying\nout, \"They are after poisoning your pigs, neighbour!\" so that we are glad\nto run, I and my sister, with perhaps the farm-engro shouting after us.\nSays my sister to me, when we have got fairly off, \"How came that ugly\none to know what you said to me?\"  Whereupon I answers, \"It all comes of\nmy son Jasper, who brings the gorgio to our fire, and must needs be\nteaching him.\"  \"Who was fool there?\" says my sister.  \"Who, indeed, but\nmy son Jasper,\" I answers.  And here should I be a greater fool to sit\nstill and suffer it; which I will not do.  I do not like the look of him;\nhe looks over-gorgeous.  An ill day to the Romans when he masters\nRommany; and, when I says that, I pens a true dukkerin.'\n\n'What do you call God, Jasper?'\n\n'You had better be jawing,' said the woman, raising her voice to a\nterrible scream; 'you had better be moving off, my gorgio; hang you for a\nkeen one, sitting there by the fire, and stealing my language before my\nface.  Do you know whom you have to deal with?  Do you know that I am\ndangerous?  My name is Herne, and I comes of the hairy ones!'\n\nAnd a hairy one she looked!  She wore her hair clubbed upon her head,\nfastened with many strings and ligatures; but now, tearing these off, her\nlocks, originally jet black, but now partially grizzled with age, fell\ndown on every side of her, covering her face and back as far down as her\nknees.  No she-bear of Lapland ever looked more fierce and hairy than did\nthat woman, as standing in the open part of the tent, with her head bent\ndown, and her shoulders drawn up, seemingly about to precipitate herself\nupon me, she repeated, again and again,--\n\n'My name is Herne, and I comes of the hairy ones!--'\n\n'I call God Duvel, brother.'\n\n'It sounds very like Devil.'\n\n'It doth, brother, it doth.'\n\n'And what do you call divine, I mean godly?'\n\n'Oh!  I call that duvelskoe.'\n\n'I am thinking of something, Jasper.'\n\n'What are you thinking of, brother?'\n\n'Would it not be a rum thing if divine and devilish were originally one\nand the same word?'\n\n'It would, brother, it would--'\n\n. . .\n\nFrom this time I had frequent interviews with Jasper, sometimes in his\ntent, sometimes on the heath, about which we would roam for hours,\ndiscoursing on various matters.  Sometimes, mounted on one of his horses,\nof which he had several, I would accompany him to various fairs and\nmarkets in the neighbourhood, to which he went on his own affairs, or\nthose of his tribe.  I soon found that I had become acquainted with a\nmost singular people, whose habits and pursuits awakened within me the\nhighest interest.  Of all connected with them, however, their language\nwas doubtless that which exercised the greatest influence over my\nimagination.  I had at first some suspicion that it would prove a mere\nmade-up gibberish; but I was soon undeceived.  Broken, corrupted, and\nhalf in ruins as it was, it was not long before I found that it was an\noriginal speech, far more so, indeed, than one or two others of high name\nand celebrity, which, up to that time, I had been in the habit of\nregarding with respect and veneration.  Indeed many obscure points\nconnected with the vocabulary of these languages, and to which neither\nclassic nor modern lore afforded any clue, I thought I could now clear up\nby means of this strange broken tongue, spoken by people who dwelt\namongst thickets and furze bushes, in tents as tawny as their faces, and\nwhom the generality of mankind designated, and with much semblance of\njustice, as thieves and vagabonds.  But where did this speech come from,\nand who were they who spoke it?  These were questions which I could not\nsolve, and which Jasper himself, when pressed, confessed his inability to\nanswer.  'But, whoever we be, brother,' said he, 'we are an old people,\nand not what folks in general imagine, broken gorgios; and, if we are not\nEgyptians, we are at any rate Rommany Chals!'\n\n{picture:'My name is Herne, and I comes of the hairy ones!': page122.jpg}\n\n'Rommany Chals!  I should not wonder after all,' said I, 'that these\npeople had something to do with the founding of Rome.  Rome, it is said,\nwas built by vagabonds, who knows but that some tribe of the kind settled\ndown thereabouts, and called the town which they built after their name;\nbut whence did they come originally? ah! there is the difficulty.'\n\nBut abandoning these questions, which at that time were far too profound\nfor me, I went on studying the language, and at the same time the\ncharacters and manners of these strange people.  My rapid progress in the\nformer astonished, while it delighted, Jasper.  'We'll no longer call you\nSap-engro, brother,' said he; but rather Lav-engro, which in the language\nof the gorgios meaneth Word-master.'  'Nay, brother,' said Tawno Chikno,\nwith whom I had become very intimate, 'you had better call him\nCooro-mengro, I have put on _the gloves_ with him, and find him a pure\nfist-master; I like him for that, for I am a Cooro-mengro myself, and was\nborn at Brummagem.'\n\n'I likes him for his modesty,' said Mrs. Chikno; 'I never hears any ill\nwords come from his mouth, but, on the contrary, much sweet language.  His\ntalk is golden, and he has taught my eldest to say his prayers in\nRommany, which my rover had never the grace to do.'  'He is the pal of my\nrom,' said Mrs. Petulengro, who was a very handsome woman, 'and therefore\nI likes him, and not the less for his being a rye; folks calls me high-\nminded, and perhaps I have reason to be so; before I married Pharaoh I\nhad an offer from a lord--I likes the young rye, and, if he chooses to\nfollow us, he shall have my sister.  What say you, mother? should not the\nyoung rye have my sister Ursula?'\n\n{picture:'To gain a bad brother, ye have lost a good mother.':\npage124.jpg}\n\n'I am going to my people,' said Mrs. Herne, placing a bundle upon a\ndonkey, which was her own peculiar property; 'I am going to Yorkshire,\nfor I can stand this no longer.  You say you like him: in that we\ndiffers; I hates the gorgio, and would like, speaking Romanly, to mix a\nlittle poison with his waters.  And now go to Lundra, my children, I goes\nto Yorkshire.  Take my blessing with ye, and a little bit of a gillie to\ncheer your hearts with when ye are weary.  In all kinds of weather have\nwe lived together; but now we are parted.  I goes broken-hearted--I can't\nkeep you company; ye are no longer Rommany.  To gain a bad brother, ye\nhave lost a good mother.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\n\nWhat profession?--Not fitted for a Churchman--Erratic course--The bitter\ndraught--Principle of woe--Thou wouldst be joyous--What ails you?--Poor\nchild of clay.\n\nSo the gypsies departed; Mrs. Herne to Yorkshire, and the rest to London:\nas for myself, I continued in the house of my parents, passing my time in\nmuch the same manner as I have already described, principally in\nphilological pursuits; but I was now sixteen, and it was highly necessary\nthat I should adopt some profession, unless I intended to fritter away my\nexistence, and to be a useless burden to those who had given me birth;\nbut what profession was I to choose? there being none in the wide world\nperhaps for which I was suited; nor was there any one for which I felt\nany decided inclination, though perhaps there existed within me a lurking\npenchant for the profession of arms, which was natural enough, as, from\nmy earliest infancy, I had been accustomed to military sights and sounds;\nbut this profession was then closed, as I have already hinted, and, as I\nbelieve, it has since continued, to those who, like myself, had no better\nclaims to urge than the services of a father.\n\nMy father, who, for certain reasons of his own, had no very high opinion\nof the advantages resulting from this career, would have gladly seen me\nenter the Church.  His desire was, however, considerably abated by one or\ntwo passages of my life, which occurred to his recollection.  He\nparticularly dwelt on the unheard-of manner in which I had picked up the\nIrish language, and drew from thence the conclusion that I was not fitted\nby nature to cut a respectable figure at an English university.  'He will\nfly off in a tangent,' said he, 'and, when called upon to exhibit his\nskill in Greek, will be found proficient in Irish; I have observed the\npoor lad attentively, and really do not know what to make of him; but I\nam afraid he will never make a churchman!'  And I have no doubt that my\nexcellent father was right, both in his premisses and the conclusion at\nwhich he arrived.  I had undoubtedly, at one period of my life, forsaken\nGreek for Irish, and the instructions of a learned Protestant divine for\nthose of a Papist gossoon, the card-fancying Murtagh; and of late, though\nI kept it a strict secret, I had abandoned in a great measure the study\nof the beautiful Italian, and the recitation of the sonorous terzets of\nthe Divine Comedy, in which at one time I took the greatest delight, in\norder to become acquainted with the broken speech, and yet more broken\nsongs, of certain houseless wanderers whom I had met at a horse fair.\nSuch an erratic course was certainly by no means in consonance with the\nsober and unvarying routine of college study.  And my father, who was a\nman of excellent common sense, displayed it in not pressing me to adopt a\nprofession which required qualities of mind which he saw I did not\npossess.\n\nOther professions were talked of, amongst which the law; but now an event\noccurred which had nearly stopped my career, and merged all minor points\nof solicitude in anxiety for my life.  My strength and appetite suddenly\ndeserted me, and I began to pine and droop.  Some said that I had\novergrown myself, and that these were the symptoms of a rapid decline; I\ngrew worse and worse, and was soon stretched upon my bed, from which it\nseemed scarcely probable that I should ever more rise, the physicians\nthemselves giving but slight hopes of my recovery: as for myself, I made\nup my mind to die, and felt quite resigned.  I was sadly ignorant at that\ntime, and, when I thought of death, it appeared to me little else than a\npleasant sleep, and I wished for sleep, of which I got but little.  It\nwas well that I did not die that time, for I repeat that I was sadly\nignorant of many important things.  I did not die, for somebody coming\ngave me a strange, bitter draught; a decoction, I believe, of a bitter\nroot which grows on commons and desolate places: and the person who gave\nit me was an ancient female, a kind of doctress, who had been my nurse in\nmy infancy, and who, hearing of my state, had come to see me; so I drank\nthe draught, and became a little better, and I continued taking draughts\nmade from the bitter root till I manifested symptoms of convalescence.\n\nBut how much more quickly does strength desert the human frame than\nreturn to it!  I had become convalescent, it is true, but my state of\nfeebleness was truly pitiable.  I believe it is in that state that the\nmost remarkable feature of human physiology frequently exhibits itself.\nOh, how dare I mention the dark feeling of mysterious dread which comes\nover the mind, and which the lamp of reason, though burning bright the\nwhile, is unable to dispel!  Art thou, as leeches say, the concomitant of\ndisease--the result of shattered nerves?  Nay, rather the principle of\nwoe itself, the fountain-head of all sorrow coexistent with man, whose\ninfluence he feels when yet unborn, and whose workings he testifies with\nhis earliest cries, when, 'drowned in tears,' he first beholds the light;\nfor, as the sparks fly upward, so is man born to trouble, and woe doth he\nbring with him into the world, even thyself, dark one, terrible one,\ncauseless, unbegotten, without a father.  Oh, how unfrequently dost thou\nbreak down the barriers which divide thee from the poor soul of man, and\novercast its sunshine with thy gloomy shadow.  In the brightest days of\nprosperity--in the midst of health and wealth--how sentient is the poor\nhuman creature of thy neighbourhood! how instinctively aware that the\nflood-gates of horror may be cast open, and the dark stream engulf him\nfor ever and ever!  Then is it not lawful for man to exclaim, 'Better\nthat I had never been born!'  Fool, for thyself thou wast not born, but\nto fulfil the inscrutable decrees of thy Creator; and how dost thou know\nthat this dark principle is not, after all, thy best friend; that it is\nnot that which tempers the whole mass of thy corruption?  It may be, for\nwhat thou knowest, the mother of wisdom, and of great works: it is the\ndread of the horror of the night that makes the pilgrim hasten on his\nway.  When thou feelest it nigh, let thy safety word be 'Onward'; if thou\ntarry, thou art overwhelmed.  Courage! build great works--'tis urging\nthee--it is ever nearest the favourites of God--the fool knows little of\nit.  Thou wouldst be joyous, wouldst thou? then be a fool.  What great\nwork was ever the result of joy, the puny one?  Who have been the wise\nones, the mighty ones, the conquering ones of this earth? the joyous?  I\nbelieve not.  The fool is happy, or comparatively so--certainly the least\nsorrowful, but he is still a fool: and whose notes are sweetest, those of\nthe nightingale, or of the silly lark?\n\n'What ails you, my child?' said a mother to her son, as he lay on a couch\nunder the influence of the dreadful one; 'what ails you? you seem\nafraid!'\n\n_Boy_.  And so I am; a dreadful fear is upon me.\n\n_Mother_.  But of what?  There is no one can harm you; of what are you\napprehensive?\n\n_Boy_.  Of nothing that I can express; I know not what I am afraid of,\nbut afraid I am.\n\n_Mother_.  Perhaps you see sights and visions; I knew a lady once who was\ncontinually thinking that she saw an armed man threaten her, but it was\nonly an imagination, a phantom of the brain.\n\n_Boy_.  No armed man threatens me; and 'tis not a thing like that would\ncause me any fear.  Did an armed man threaten me, I would get up and\nfight him; weak as I am, I would wish for nothing better, for then,\nperhaps, I should lose this fear; mine is a dread of I know not what, and\nthere the horror lies.\n\n_Mother_.  Your forehead is cool, and your speech collected.  Do you know\nwhere you are?\n\n_Boy_.  I know where I am, and I see things just as they are; you are\nbeside me, and upon the table there is a book which was written by a\nFlorentine; all this I see, and that there is no ground for being afraid.\nI am, moreover, quite cool, and feel no pain--but, but--\n\nAnd then there was a burst of 'gemiti, sospiri ed alti guai.'  Alas,\nalas, poor child of clay! as the sparks fly upward, so wast thou born to\nsorrow--Onward!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\n\nAgreeable delusions--Youth--A profession--Ab Gwilym--Glorious English\nlaw--There they pass--My dear old master--The deal desk--Language of the\ntents--Where is Morfydd?--Go to--only once.\n\nIt has been said by this or that writer, I scarcely know by whom, that,\nin proportion as we grow old, and our time becomes short, the swifter\ndoes it pass, until at last, as we approach the borders of the grave, it\nassumes all the speed and impetuosity of a river about to precipitate\nitself into an abyss; this is doubtless the case, provided we can carry\nto the grave those pleasant thoughts and delusions, which alone render\nlife agreeable, and to which even to the very last we would gladly cling;\nbut what becomes of the swiftness of time, when the mind sees the vanity\nof human pursuits? which is sure to be the case when its fondest, dearest\nhopes have been blighted at the very moment when the harvest was deemed\nsecure.  What becomes from that moment, I repeat, of the shortness of\ntime?  I put not the question to those who have never known that trial,\nthey are satisfied with themselves and all around them, with what they\nhave done, and yet hope to do; some carry their delusions with them to\nthe borders of the grave, ay, to the very moment when they fall into it;\na beautiful golden cloud surrounds them to the last, and such talk of the\nshortness of time: through the medium of that cloud the world has ever\nbeen a pleasant world to them; their only regret is that they are so soon\nto quit it; but oh, ye dear deluded hearts, it is not every one who is so\nfortunate!\n\nTo the generality of mankind there is no period like youth.  The\ngenerality are far from fortunate; but the period of youth, even to the\nleast so, offers moments of considerable happiness, for they are not only\ndisposed but able to enjoy most things within their reach.  With what\ntrifles at that period are we content; the things from which in after-\nlife we should turn away in disdain please us then, for we are in the\nmidst of a golden cloud, and everything seems decked with a golden hue.\nNever during any portion of my life did time flow on more speedily than\nduring the two or three years immediately succeeding the period to which\nwe arrived in the preceding chapter: since then it has flagged often\nenough; sometimes it has seemed to stand entirely still; and the reader\nmay easily judge how it fares at the present, from the circumstance of my\ntaking pen in hand, and endeavouring to write down the passages of my\nlife--a last resource with most people.  But at the period to which I\nallude I was just, as I may say, entering upon life; I had adopted a\nprofession, and, to keep up my character, simultaneously with that\nprofession--the study of a new language.  I speedily became a proficient\nin the one, but ever remained a novice in the other: a novice in the law,\nbut a perfect master in the Welsh tongue.\n\nYes; very pleasant times were those, when within the womb of a lofty deal\ndesk, behind which I sat for some eight hours every day, transcribing\n(when I imagined eyes were upon me) documents of every description in\nevery possible hand, Blackstone kept company with Ab Gwilym--the polished\nEnglish lawyer of the last century, who wrote long and prosy chapters on\nthe rights of things--with a certain wild Welshman, who some four hundred\nyears before that time indited immortal cowydds and odes to the wives of\nCambrian chieftains--more particularly to one Morfydd, the wife of a\ncertain hunchbacked dignitary called by the poet facetiously Bwa\nBach--generally terminating with the modest request of a little private\nparlance beneath the greenwood bough, with no other witness than the eos,\nor nightingale, a request which, if the poet himself may be believed,\nrather a doubtful point, was seldom, very seldom, denied.  And by what\nstrange chance had Ab Gwilym and Blackstone, two personages so\nexceedingly different, been thus brought together?  From what the reader\nalready knows of me, he may be quite prepared to find me reading the\nformer; but what could have induced me to take up Blackstone, or rather\nthe law?\n\nI have ever loved to be as explicit as possible; on which account,\nperhaps, I never attained to any proficiency in the law, the essence of\nwhich is said to be ambiguity; most questions may be answered in a few\nwords, and this among the rest, though connected with the law.  My\nparents deemed it necessary that I should adopt some profession, they\nnamed the law; the law was as agreeable to me as any other profession\nwithin my reach, so I adopted the law, and the consequence was, that\nBlackstone, probably for the first time, found himself in company with Ab\nGwilym.  By adopting the law I had not ceased to be Lavengro.\n\nSo I sat behind a desk many hours in the day, ostensibly engaged in\ntranscribing documents of various kinds; the scene of my labours was a\nstrange old house, occupying one side of a long and narrow court, into\nwhich, however, the greater number of the windows looked not, but into an\nextensive garden, filled with fruit trees, in the rear of a large,\nhandsome house, belonging to a highly respectable gentleman, who,\nmoyennant un douceur considerable, had consented to instruct my father's\nyoungest son in the mysteries of glorious English law.  Ah! would that I\ncould describe the good gentleman in the manner which he deserves; he has\nlong since sunk to his place in a respectable vault, in the aisle of a\nvery respectable church, whilst an exceedingly respectable marble slab\nagainst the neighbouring wall tells on a Sunday some eye wandering from\nits prayer-book that his dust lies below; to secure such respectabilities\nin death, he passed a most respectable life.  Let no one sneer, he\naccomplished much; his life was peaceful, so was his death.  Are these\ntrifles?  I wish I could describe him, for I loved the man, and with\nreason, for he was ever kind to me, to whom kindness has not always been\nshown; and he was, moreover, a choice specimen of a class which no longer\nexists--a gentleman lawyer of the old school.  I would fain describe him,\nbut figures with which he has nought to do press forward and keep him\nfrom my mind's eye; there they pass, Spaniard and Moor, Gypsy, Turk, and\nlivid Jew.  But who is that? what that thick pursy man in the loose,\nsnuff-coloured greatcoat, with the white stockings, drab breeches, and\nsilver buckles on his shoes; that man with the bull neck, and singular\nhead, immense in the lower part, especially about the jaws, but tapering\nupward like a pear; the man with the bushy brows, small gray eyes replete\nwith catlike expression, whose grizzled hair is cut close, and whose ear-\nlobes are pierced with small golden rings?  Oh! that is not my dear old\nmaster, but a widely different personage.  Bon jour, Monsieur Vidocq!\nexpressions de ma part a Monsieur Le Baron Taylor.  But here he comes at\nlast, my veritable old master!\n\nA more respectable-looking individual was never seen; he really looked\nwhat he was, a gentleman of the law--there was nothing of the pettifogger\nabout him: somewhat under the middle size, and somewhat rotund in person,\nhe was always dressed in a full suit of black, never worn long enough to\nbecome threadbare.  His face was rubicund, and not without keenness; but\nthe most remarkable thing about him was the crown of his head, which was\nbald, and shone like polished ivory, nothing more white, smooth, and\nlustrous.  Some people have said that he wore false calves, probably\nbecause his black silk stockings never exhibited a wrinkle; they might\njust as well have said that he waddled, because his shoes creaked; for\nthese last, which were always without a speck, and polished as his crown,\nthough of a different hue, did creak, as he walked rather slowly.  I\ncannot say that I ever saw him walk fast.\n\nHe had a handsome practice, and might have died a very rich man, much\nricher than he did, had he not been in the habit of giving rather\nexpensive dinners to certain great people, who gave him nothing in return\nexcept their company; I could never discover his reasons for doing so, as\nhe always appeared to me a remarkably quiet man, by nature averse to\nnoise and bustle; but in all dispositions there are anomalies: I have\nalready said that he lived in a handsome house, and I may as well here\nadd that he had a very handsome wife, who both dressed and talked\nexceedingly well.\n\nSo I sat behind the deal desk, engaged in copying documents of various\nkinds; and in the apartment in which I sat, and in the adjoining ones,\nthere were others, some of whom likewise copied documents, while some\nwere engaged in the yet more difficult task of drawing them up; and some\nof these, sons of nobody, were paid for the work they did, whilst others,\nlike myself, sons of somebody, paid for being permitted to work, which,\nas our principal observed, was but reasonable, forasmuch as we not\nunfrequently utterly spoiled the greater part of the work intrusted to\nour hands.\n\nThere was one part of the day when I generally found myself quite alone,\nI mean at the hour when the rest went home to their principal meal; I,\nbeing the youngest, was left to take care of the premises, to answer the\nbell, and so forth, till relieved, which was seldom before the expiration\nof an hour and a half, when I myself went home; this period, however, was\nanything but disagreeable to me, for it was then that I did what best\npleased me, and, leaving off copying the documents, I sometimes indulged\nin a fit of musing, my chin resting on both my hands, and my elbows\nplanted on the desk; or, opening the desk aforesaid, I would take out one\nof the books contained within it, and the book which I took out was\nalmost invariably, not Blackstone, but Ab Gwilym.\n\nAh, that Ab Gwilym!  I am much indebted to him, and it were ungrateful on\nmy part not to devote a few lines to him and his songs in this my\nhistory.  Start not, reader, I am not going to trouble you with a\npoetical dissertation; no, no; I know my duty too well to introduce\nanything of the kind; but I, who imagine I know several things, and\namongst others the workings of your mind at this moment, have an idea\nthat you are anxious to learn a little, a very little, more about Ab\nGwilym than I have hitherto told you, the two or three words that I have\ndropped having awakened within you a languid kind of curiosity.  I have\nno hesitation in saying that he makes one of the some half-dozen really\ngreat poets whose verses, in whatever language they wrote, exist at the\npresent day, and are more or less known.  It matters little how I first\nbecame acquainted with the writings of this man, and how the short thick\nvolume, stuffed full with his immortal imaginings, first came into my\nhands.  I was studying Welsh, and I fell in with Ab Gwilym by no very\nstrange chance.  But, before I say more about Ab Gwilym, I must be\npermitted--I really must--to say a word or two about the language in\nwhich he wrote, that same 'Sweet Welsh.'  If I remember right, I found\nthe language a difficult one; in mastering it, however, I derived\nunexpected assistance from what of Irish remained in my head, and I soon\nfound that they were cognate dialects, springing from some old tongue\nwhich itself, perhaps, had sprung from one much older.  And here I cannot\nhelp observing cursorily that I every now and then, whilst studying this\nWelsh, generally supposed to be the original tongue of Britain,\nencountered words which, according to the lexicographers, were venerable\nwords highly expressive, showing the wonderful power and originality of\nthe Welsh, in which, however, they were no longer used in common\ndiscourse, but were relics, precious relics, of the first speech of\nBritain, perhaps of the world; with which words, however, I was already\nwell acquainted, and which I had picked up, not in learned books, classic\nbooks, and in tongues of old renown, but whilst listening to Mr.\nPetulengro and Tawno Chikno talking over their everyday affairs in the\nlanguage of the tents; which circumstance did not fail to give rise to\ndeep reflection in those moments when, planting my elbows on the deal\ndesk, I rested my chin upon my hands.  But it is probable that I should\nhave abandoned the pursuit of the Welsh language, after obtaining a very\nsuperficial acquaintance with it, had it not been for Ab Gwilym.\n\nA strange songster was that who, pretending to be captivated by every\nwoman he saw, was, in reality, in love with nature alone--wild,\nbeautiful, solitary nature--her mountains and cascades, her forests and\nstreams, her birds, fishes, and wild animals.  Go to, Ab Gwilym, with thy\npseudo-amatory odes, to Morfydd, or this or that other lady, fair or\nugly; little didst thou care for any of them, Dame Nature was thy love,\nhowever thou mayest seek to disguise the truth.  Yes, yes, send thy love-\nmessage to Morfydd, the fair wanton.  By whom dost thou send it, I would\nknow? by the salmon forsooth, which haunts the rushing stream! the\nglorious salmon which bounds and gambols in the flashing water, and whose\nways and circumstances thou so well describest--see, there he hurries\nupwards through the flashing water.  Halloo! what a glimpse of glory--but\nwhere is Morfydd the while?  What, another message to the wife of Bwa\nBach?  Ay, truly; and by whom?--the wind! the swift wind, the rider of\nthe world, whose course is not to be stayed; who gallops o'er the\nmountain, and, when he comes to broadest river, asks neither for boat nor\nferry; who has described the wind so well--his speed and power?  But\nwhere is Morfydd?  And now thou art awaiting Morfydd, the wanton, the\nwife of the Bwa Bach; thou art awaiting her beneath the tall trees,\namidst the underwood; but she comes not; no Morfydd is there.  Quite\nright, Ab Gwilym; what wantest thou with Morfydd? But another form is\nnigh at hand, that of red Reynard, who, seated upon his chine at the\nmouth of his cave, looks very composedly at thee; thou startest, bendest\nthy bow, thy cross-bow, intending to hit Reynard with the bolt just about\nthe jaw; but the bow breaks, Reynard barks and disappears into his cave,\nwhich by thine own account reaches hell--and then thou ravest at the\nmisfortune of thy bow, and the non-appearance of Morfydd, and abusest\nReynard.  Go to, thou carest neither for thy bow nor for Morfydd, thou\nmerely seekest an opportunity to speak of Reynard; and who has described\nhim like thee? the brute with the sharp shrill cry, the black reverse of\nmelody, whose face sometimes wears a smile like the devil's in the\nEvangile.  But now thou art actually with Morfydd; yes, she has stolen\nfrom the dwelling of the Bwa Bach and has met thee beneath those\nrocks--she is actually with thee, Ab Gwilym; but she is not long with\nthee, for a storm comes on, and thunder shatters the rocks--Morfydd\nflees!  Quite right, Ab Gwilym; thou hadst no need of her, a better theme\nfor song is the voice of the Lord--the rock-shatterer--than the frail\nwife of the Bwa Bach.  Go to, Ab Gwilym, thou wast a wiser and a better\nman than thou wouldst fain have had people believe.\n\nBut enough of thee and thy songs!  Those times passed rapidly; with Ab\nGwilym in my hand, I was in the midst of enchanted ground, in which I\nexperienced sensations akin to those I had felt of yore whilst spelling\nmy way through the wonderful book--the delight of my childhood.  I say\nakin, for perhaps only once in our lives do we experience unmixed wonder\nand delight; and these I had already known.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\n\nSilver gray--Good word for everybody--A remarkable youth--Clients--Grades\nin society--The archdeacon--Reading the Bible.\n\n'I am afraid that I have not acted very wisely in putting this boy of\nours to the law,' said my father to my mother, as they sat together one\nsummer evening in their little garden, beneath the shade of some tall\npoplars.\n\nYes, there sat my father in the garden chair which leaned against the\nwall of his quiet home, the haven in which he had sought rest, and,\npraise be to God, found it, after many a year of poorly-requited toil;\nthere he sat, with locks of silver gray which set off so nobly his fine\nbold but benevolent face, his faithful consort at his side, and his\ntrusty dog at his feet--an eccentric animal of the genuine regimental\nbreed, who, born amongst red coats, had not yet become reconciled to\nthose of any other hue, barking and tearing at them when they drew near\nthe door, but testifying his fond reminiscence of the former by\nhospitable waggings of the tail whenever a uniform made its appearance--at\npresent a very unfrequent occurrence.\n\n'I am afraid I have not done right in putting him to the law,' said my\nfather, resting his chin upon his gold-headed bamboo cane.\n\n'Why, what makes you think so?' said my mother.\n\n'I have been taking my usual evening walk up the road, with the animal\nhere,' said my father; 'and, as I walked along, I overtook the boy's\nmaster, Mr. S---.  We shook hands, and, after walking a little way\nfarther, we turned back together, talking about this and that; the state\nof the country, the weather, and the dog, which he greatly admired; for\nhe is a good-natured man, and has a good word for everybody, though the\ndog all but bit him when he attempted to coax his head; after the dog, we\nbegan talking about the boy; it was myself who introduced that subject: I\nthought it was a good opportunity to learn how he was getting on, so I\nasked what he thought of my son; he hesitated at first, seeming scarcely\nto know what to say; at length he came out with \"Oh, a very extraordinary\nyouth, a most remarkable youth indeed, captain!\"  \"Indeed,\" said I, \"I am\nglad to hear it, but I hope you find him steady?\"  \"Steady, steady,\" said\nhe, \"why, yes, he's steady, I cannot say that he is not steady.\"  \"Come,\ncome,\" said I, beginning to be rather uneasy, \"I see plainly that you are\nnot altogether satisfied with him; I was afraid you would not be, for,\nthough he is my own son, I am anything but blind to his imperfections;\nbut do tell me what particular fault you have to find with him; and I\nwill do my best to make him alter his conduct.\"  \"No fault to find with\nhim, captain, I assure you, no fault whatever; the youth is a remarkable\nyouth, an extraordinary youth, only--\"  As I told you before, Mr. S--- is\nthe best-natured man in the world, and it was only with the greatest\ndifficulty that I could get him to say a single word to the disadvantage\nof the boy, for whom he seems to entertain a very great regard.  At last\nI forced the truth from him, and grieved I was to hear it; though I must\nconfess that I was somewhat prepared for it.  It appears that the lad has\na total want of discrimination.'\n\n'I don't understand you,' said my mother.\n\n'You can understand nothing that would seem for a moment to impugn the\nconduct of that child.  I am not, however, so blind; want of\ndiscrimination was the word, and it both sounds well, and is expressive.\nIt appears that, since he has been placed where is, he has been guilty of\nthe grossest blunders; only the other day, Mr. S--- told me, as he was\nengaged in close conversation with one of his principal clients, the boy\ncame to tell him that a person wanted particularly to speak with him;\nand, on going out, he found a lamentable figure with one eye, who came to\nask for charity; whom, nevertheless, the lad had ushered into a private\nroom, and installed in an arm-chair, like a justice of the peace, instead\nof telling him to go about his business--now what did that show, but a\ntotal want of discrimination?'\n\n'I wish we may never have anything worse to reproach him with,' said my\nmother.\n\n'I don't know what worse we could reproach him with,' said my father; 'I\nmean of course as far as his profession is concerned; discrimination is\nthe very keystone; if he treated all people alike, he would soon become a\nbeggar himself; there are grades in society as well as in the army; and\naccording to those grades we should fashion our behaviour, else there\nwould instantly be an end of all order and discipline.  I am afraid that\nthe child is too condescending to his inferiors, whilst to his superiors\nhe is apt to be unbending enough; I don't believe that would do in the\nworld; I am sure it would not in the army.  He told me another anecdote\nwith respect to his behaviour, which shocked me more than the other had\ndone.  It appears that his wife, who by the bye, is a very fine woman,\nand highly fashionable, gave him permission to ask the boy to tea one\nevening, for she is herself rather partial to the lad; there had been a\ngreat dinner party there that day, and there were a great many\nfashionable people, so the boy went and behaved very well and modestly\nfor some time, and was rather noticed, till, unluckily, a very great\ngentleman, an archdeacon I think, put some questions to him, and, finding\nthat he understood the languages, began talking to him about the\nclassics.  What do you think? the boy had the impertinence to say that\nthe classics were much overvalued, and amongst other things that some\nhorrid fellow or other, some Welshman I think (thank God it was not an\nIrishman), was a better poet than Ovid; the company were of course\nhorrified; the archdeacon, who is seventy years of age, and has seven\nthousand a year, took snuff and turned away.  Mrs. S--- turned up her\neyes, Mr. S---, however, told me with his usual good-nature (I suppose to\nspare my feelings) that he rather enjoyed the thing, and thought it a\ncapital joke.'\n\n'I think so too,' said my mother.\n\n'I do not,' said my father; 'that a boy of his years should entertain an\nopinion of his own--I mean one which militates against all established\nauthority--is astounding; as well might a raw recruit pretend to offer an\nunfavourable opinion on the manual and platoon exercise; the idea is\npreposterous; the lad is too independent by half.  I never yet knew one\nof an independent spirit get on in the army, the secret of success in the\narmy is the spirit of subordination.'\n\n'Which is a poor spirit after all,' said my mother; 'but the child is not\nin the army.'\n\n'And it is well for him that he is not,' said my father; 'but you do not\ntalk wisely, the world is a field of battle, and he who leaves the ranks,\nwhat can he expect but to be cut down?  I call his present behaviour\nleaving the ranks, and going vapouring about without orders; his only\nchance lies in falling in again as quick as possible; does he think he\ncan carry the day by himself? an opinion of his own at these years--I\nconfess I am exceedingly uneasy about the lad.'\n\n'You make me uneasy too,' said my mother; 'but I really think you are too\nhard upon the child; he is not a bad child, after all, though not,\nperhaps, all you could wish him; he is always ready to read the Bible.\nLet us go in; he is in the room above us; at least he was two hours ago,\nI left him there bending over his books; I wonder what he has been doing\nall this time, it is now getting late; let us go in, and he shall read to\nus.'\n\n'I am getting old,' said my father; 'and I love to hear the Bible read to\nme, for my own sight is something dim; yet I do not wish the child to\nread to me this night, I cannot so soon forget what I have heard; but I\nhear my eldest son's voice, he is now entering the gate; he shall read\nthe Bible to us this night.  What say you?'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\n\nThe eldest son--Saying of wild Finland--The critical time--Vaunting\npolls--One thing wanted--A father's blessing--Miracle of art--The Pope's\nhouse--Young enthusiast--Pictures of England--Persist and wrestle--The\nlittle dark man.\n\nThe eldest son!  The regard and affection which my father entertained for\nhis first-born were natural enough, and appeared to none more so than\nmyself, who cherished the same feelings towards him.  What he was as a\nboy the reader already knows, for the reader has seen him as a boy; fain\nwould I describe him at the time of which I am now speaking, when he had\nattained the verge of manhood, but the pen fails me, and I attempt not\nthe task; and yet it ought to be an easy one, for how frequently does his\nform visit my mind's eye in slumber and in wakefulness, in the light of\nday and in the night watches; but last night I saw him in his beauty and\nhis strength; he was about to speak, and my ear was on the stretch, when\nat once I awoke, and there was I alone, and the night storm was howling\namidst the branches of the pines which surround my lonely dwelling:\n'Listen to the moaning of the pine, at whose root thy hut is fastened,'--a\nsaying that, of wild Finland, in which there is wisdom; I listened and\nthought of life and death. . . . Of all human beings that I have ever\nknown, that elder brother was the most frank and generous, ay, and the\nquickest and readiest, and the best adapted to do a great thing needful\nat the critical time, when the delay of a moment would be fatal.  I have\nknown him dash from a steep bank into a stream in his full dress, and\npull out a man who was drowning; yet there were twenty others bathing in\nthe water, who might have saved him by putting out a hand, without\ninconvenience to themselves, which, however, they did not do, but stared\nwith stupid surprise at the drowning one's struggles.  Yes, whilst some\nshouted from the bank to those in the water to save the drowning one, and\nthose in the water did nothing, my brother neither shouted nor stood\nstill, but dashed from the bank and did the one thing needful, which,\nunder such circumstances, not one man in a million would have done.  Now,\nwho can wonder that a brave old man should love a son like this, and\nprefer him to any other?\n\n'My boy, my own boy, you are the very image of myself, the day I took off\nmy coat in the park to fight Big Ben,' said my father, on meeting his son\nwet and dripping, immediately after his bold feat.  And who cannot excuse\nthe honest pride of the old man--the stout old man?\n\nAy, old man, that son was worthy of thee, and thou wast worthy of such a\nson; a noble specimen wast thou of those strong single-minded Englishmen,\nwho, without making a parade either of religion or loyalty, feared God\nand honoured their king, and were not particularly friendly to the\nFrench, whose vaunting polls they occasionally broke, as at Minden and at\nMalplaquet, to the confusion vast of the eternal foes of the English\nland.  I, who was so little like thee that thou understoodst me not, and\nin whom with justice thou didst feel so little pride, had yet perception\nenough to see all thy worth, and to feel it an honour to be able to call\nmyself thy son; and if at some no distant time, when the foreign enemy\nventures to insult our shore, I be permitted to break some vaunting poll,\nit will be a triumph to me to think that, if thou hadst lived, thou\nwouldst have hailed the deed, and mightest yet discover some distant\nresemblance to thyself, the day when thou didst all but vanquish the\nmighty Brain.\n\nI have already spoken of my brother's taste for painting, and the\nprogress he had made in that beautiful art.  It is probable that, if\ncircumstances had not eventually diverted his mind from the pursuit, he\nwould have attained excellence, and left behind him some enduring\nmonument of his powers, for he had an imagination to conceive, and that\nyet rarer endowment, a hand capable of giving life, body, and reality to\nthe conceptions of his mind; perhaps he wanted one thing, the want of\nwhich is but too often fatal to the sons of genius, and without which\ngenius is little more than a splendid toy in the hands of the\npossessor--perseverance, dogged perseverance, in his proper calling;\notherwise, though the grave had closed over him, he might still be living\nin the admiration of his fellow-creatures.  O ye gifted ones, follow your\ncalling, for, however various your talents may be, ye can have but one\ncalling capable of leading ye to eminence and renown; follow resolutely\nthe one straight path before you, it is that of your good angel, let\nneither obstacles nor temptations induce ye to leave it; bound along if\nyou can; if not, on hands and knees follow it, perish in it, if needful;\nbut ye need not fear that; no one ever yet died in the true path of his\ncalling before he had attained the pinnacle.  Turn into other paths, and\nfor a momentary advantage or gratification ye have sold your inheritance,\nyour immortality.  Ye will never be heard of after death.\n\n'My father has given me a hundred and fifty pounds,' said my brother to\nme one morning, 'and something which is better--his blessing.  I am going\nto leave you.'\n\n'And where are you going?'\n\n'Where? to the great city; to London, to be sure.'\n\n'I should like to go with you.'\n\n'Pooh,' said my brother, 'what should you do there?  But don't be\ndiscouraged, I daresay a time will come when you too will go to London.'\n\nAnd, sure enough, so it did, and all but too soon.\n\n'And what do you purpose doing there?' I demanded.\n\n'Oh, I go to improve myself in art, to place myself under some master of\nhigh name, at least I hope to do so eventually.  I have, however, a plan\nin my head, which I should wish first to execute; indeed, I do not think\nI can rest till I have done so; every one talks so much about Italy, and\nthe wondrous artists which it has produced, and the wondrous pictures\nwhich are to be found there; now I wish to see Italy, or rather Rome, the\ngreat city, for I am told that in a certain room there is contained the\ngrand miracle of art.'\n\n'And what do you call it?'\n\n'The Transfiguration, painted by one Rafael, and it is said to be the\ngreatest work of the greatest painter whom the world has ever known.  I\nsuppose it is because everybody says so, that I have such a strange\ndesire to see it.  I have already made myself well acquainted with its\nlocality, and think that I could almost find my way to it blindfold.  When\nI have crossed the Tiber, which, as you are aware, runs through Rome, I\nmust presently turn to the right, up a rather shabby street, which\ncommunicates with a large square, the farther end of which is entirely\noccupied by the front of an immense church, with a dome which ascends\nalmost to the clouds, and this church they call St. Peter's.'\n\n'Ay, ay,' said I, 'I have read about that in Keysler's Travels.'\n\n'Before the church, in the square, are two fountains, one on either side,\ncasting up water in showers; between them, in the midst, is an obelisk,\nbrought from Egypt, and covered with mysterious writing; on your right\nrises an edifice, not beautiful nor grand, but huge and bulky, where\nlives a strange kind of priest whom men call the Pope, a very horrible\nold individual, who would fain keep Christ in leading strings, calls the\nVirgin Mary the Queen of Heaven, and himself God's Lieutenant-General\nupon earth.'\n\n'Ay, ay,' said I, 'I have read of him in Foxe's _Book of Martyrs_.'\n\n'Well, I do not go straight forward up the flight of steps conducting\ninto the church, but I turn to the right, and, passing under the piazza,\nfind myself in a court of the huge bulky house; and then ascend various\nstaircases, and pass along various corridors and galleries, all of which\nI could describe to you, though I have never seen them; at last a door is\nunlocked, and we enter a room rather high, but not particularly large,\ncommunicating with another room, into which, however, I do not go, though\nthere are noble things in that second room--immortal things, by immortal\nartists; amongst others, a grand piece of Correggio; I do not enter it,\nfor the grand picture of the world is not there; but I stand still\nimmediately on entering the first room, and I look straight before me,\nneither to the right nor left, though there are noble things both on the\nright and left, for immediately before me at the farther end, hanging\nagainst the wall, is a picture which arrests me, and I can see nothing\nelse, for that picture at the farther end hanging against the wall is the\npicture of the world. . . .'\n\nYes, go thy way, young enthusiast, and, whether to London town or to old\nRome, may success attend thee; yet strange fears assail me and misgivings\non thy account.  Thou canst not rest, thou say'st, till thou hast seen\nthe picture in the chamber at old Rome hanging over against the wall; ay,\nand thus thou dust exemplify thy weakness--thy strength too, it may\nbe--for the one idea, fantastic yet lovely, which now possesses thee,\ncould only have originated in a genial and fervent brain.  Well, go, if\nthou must go; yet it perhaps were better for thee to bide in thy native\nland, and there, with fear and trembling, with groanings, with straining\neyeballs, toil, drudge, slave, till thou hast made excellence thine own;\nthou wilt scarcely acquire it by staring at the picture over against the\ndoor in the high chamber of old Rome.  Seekest thou inspiration? thou\nneedest it not, thou hast it already; and it was never yet found by\ncrossing the sea.  What hast thou to do with old Rome, and thou an\nEnglishman?  'Did thy blood never glow at the mention of thy native\nland?' as an artist merely?  Yes, I trow, and with reason, for thy native\nland need not grudge old Rome her 'pictures of the world'; she has\npictures of her own, 'pictures of England'; and is it a new thing to toss\nup caps and shout--England against the world?  Yes, against the world in\nall, in all; in science and in arms, in minstrel strain, and not less in\nthe art 'which enables the hand to deceive the intoxicated soul by means\nof pictures.' {143}  Seek'st models? to Gainsborough and Hogarth turn,\nnot names of the world, maybe, but English names--and England against the\nworld!  A living master? why, there he comes! thou hast had him long, he\nhas long guided thy young hand towards the excellence which is yet far\nfrom thee, but which thou canst attain if thou shouldst persist and\nwrestle, even as he has done, 'midst gloom and despondency--ay, and even\ncontempt; he who now comes up the creaking stair to thy little studio in\nthe second floor to inspect thy last effort before thou departest, the\nlittle stout man whose face is very dark, and whose eye is vivacious;\nthat man has attained excellence, destined some day to be acknowledged,\nthough not till he is cold, and his mortal part returned to its kindred\nclay.  He has painted, not pictures of the world, but English pictures,\nsuch as Gainsborough himself might have done; beautiful rural pieces,\nwith trees which might well tempt the wild birds to perch upon them, thou\nneedest not run to Rome, brother, where lives the old Mariolater, after\npictures of the world, whilst at home there are pictures of England; nor\nneedest thou even go to London, the big city, in search of a master, for\nthou hast one at home in the old East Anglian town who can instruct thee\nwhilst thou needest instruction: better stay at home, brother, at least\nfor a season, and toil and strive 'midst groanings and despondency till\nthou hast attained excellence even as he has done--the little dark man\nwith the brown coat and the top-boots, whose name will one day be\nconsidered the chief ornament of the old town, and whose works will at no\ndistant period rank amongst the proudest pictures of England--and England\nagainst the world!--thy master, my brother, thy, at present, all too\nlittle considered master--Crome.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\n\nDesire for novelty--Lives of the lawless--Countenances--Old yeoman and\ndame--We live near the sea--Uncouth-looking volume--The other\ncondition--Draoitheac--A dilemma--The Antinomian--Lodowick\nMuggleton--Almost blind--Anders Vedel.\n\nBut to proceed with my own story: I now ceased all at once to take much\npleasure in the pursuits which formerly interested me, I yawned over Ab\nGwilym, even as I now in my mind's eye perceive the reader yawning over\nthe present pages.  What was the cause of this? Constitutional lassitude,\nor a desire for novelty?  Both it is probable had some influence in the\nmatter, but I rather think that the latter feeling was predominant.  The\nparting words of my brother had sunk into my mind.  He had talked of\ntravelling in strange regions and seeing strange and wonderful objects,\nand my imagination fell to work, and drew pictures of adventures wild and\nfantastic, and I thought what a fine thing it must be to travel, and I\nwished that my father would give me his blessing, and the same sum that\nhe had given my brother, and bid me go forth into the world; always\nforgetting that I had neither talents nor energies at this period which\nwould enable me to make any successful figure on its stage.\n\nAnd then I again sought up the book which had so captivated me in my\ninfancy, and I read it through; and I sought up others of a similar\ncharacter, and in seeking for them I met books also of adventure, but by\nno means of a harmless description, lives of wicked and lawless men,\nMurray and Latroon--books of singular power, but of coarse and prurient\nimagination--books at one time highly in vogue; now deservedly forgotten,\nand most difficult to be found.\n\nAnd when I had gone through these books, what was my state of mind?  I\nhad derived entertainment from their perusal, but they left me more\nlistless and unsettled than before, and really knew not what to do to\npass my time.  My philological studies had become distasteful, and I had\nnever taken any pleasure in the duties of my profession.  I sat behind my\ndesk in a state of torpor, my mind almost as blank as the paper before\nme, on which I rarely traced a line.  It was always a relief to hear the\nbell ring, as it afforded me an opportunity of doing something which I\nwas yet capable of doing, to rise and open the door and stare in the\ncountenances of the visitors.  All of a sudden I fell to studying\ncountenances, and soon flattered myself that I had made considerable\nprogress in the science.\n\n'There is no faith in countenances,' said some Roman of old; 'trust\nanything but a person's countenance.'  'Not trust a man's countenance?'\nsay some moderns, 'why, it is the only thing in many people that we can\ntrust; on which account they keep it most assiduously out of the way.\nTrust not a man's words if you please, or you may come to very erroneous\nconclusions; but at all times place implicit confidence in a man's\ncountenance, in which there is no deceit; and of necessity there can be\nnone.  If people would but look each other more in the face, we should\nhave less cause to complain of the deception of the world; nothing so\neasy as physiognomy nor so useful.'  Somewhat in this latter strain I\nthought at the time of which I am speaking.  I am now older, and, let us\nhope, less presumptuous.  It is true that in the course of my life I have\nscarcely ever had occasion to repent placing confidence in individuals\nwhose countenances have prepossessed me in their favour; though to how\nmany I may have been unjust, from whose countenances I may have drawn\nunfavourable conclusions, is another matter.\n\nBut it had been decreed by that Fate which governs our every action that\nI was soon to return to my old pursuits.  It was written that I should\nnot yet cease to be Lav-engro, though I had become, in my own opinion, a\nkind of Lavater.  It is singular enough that my renewed ardour for\nphilology seems to have been brought about indirectly by my\nphysiognomical researches, in which had I not indulged, the event which I\nam about to relate, as far as connected with myself, might never have\noccurred.  Amongst the various countenances which I admitted during the\nperiod of my answering the bell, there were two which particularly\npleased me, and which belonged to an elderly yeoman and his wife, whom\nsome little business had brought to our law sanctuary.  I believe they\nexperienced from me some kindness and attention, which won the old\npeople's hearts.  So, one day, when their little business had been\nbrought to a conclusion, and they chanced to be alone with me, who was\nseated as usual behind the deal desk in the outer room, the old man with\nsome confusion began to tell me how grateful himself and dame felt for\nthe many attentions I had shown them, and how desirous they were to make\nme some remuneration.  'Of course,' said the old man, 'we must be\ncautious what we offer to so fine a young gentleman as yourself; we have,\nhowever, something we think will just suit the occasion, a strange kind\nof thing which people say is a book, though no one that my dame or myself\nhave shown it to can make anything out of it; so as we are told that you\nare a fine young gentleman, who can read all the tongues of the earth and\nstars, as the Bible says, we thought, I and my dame, that it would be\njust the thing you would like and my dame has it now at the bottom of her\nbasket.'\n\n'A book!' said I, 'how did you come by it?'\n\n'We live near the sea,' said the old man; 'so near that sometimes our\nthatch is wet with the spray; and it may now be a year ago that there was\na fearful storm, and a ship was driven ashore during the night, and ere\nthe morn was a complete wreck.  When we got up at daylight, there were\nthe poor shivering crew at our door; they were foreigners, red-haired\nmen, whose speech we did not understand; but we took them in, and warmed\nthem, and they remained with us three days; and when they went away they\nleft behind them this thing, here it is, part of the contents of a box\nwhich was washed ashore.'\n\n'And did you learn who they were?'\n\n'Why, yes; they made us understand that they were Danes.'\n\nDanes! thought I, Danes! and instantaneously, huge and grisly, appeared\nto rise up before my vision the skull of the old pirate Dane, even as I\nhad seen it of yore in the pent-house of the ancient church to which,\nwith my mother and my brother, I had wandered on the memorable summer\neve.\n\nAnd now the old man handed me the book; a strange and uncouth-looking\nvolume enough.  It was not very large, but instead of the usual covering\nwas bound in wood, and was compressed with strong iron clasps.  It was a\nprinted book, but the pages were not of paper, but vellum, and the\ncharacters were black, and resembled those generally termed Gothic.\n\n'It is certainly a curious book,' said I; 'and I should like to have it,\nbut I can't think of taking it as a gift, I must give you an equivalent,\nI never take presents from anybody.'\n\nThe old man whispered with his dame and chuckled, and then turned his\nface to me, and said, with another chuckle, 'Well, we have agreed about\nthe price, but, maybe, you will not consent.'\n\n'I don't know,' said I; 'what do you demand?'\n\n'Why, that you shake me by the hand, and hold out your cheek to my old\ndame, she has taken an affection to you.'\n\n'I shall be very glad to shake you by the hand,' said I, 'but as for the\nother condition, it requires consideration.'\n\n'No consideration at all,' said the old man, with something like a sigh;\n'she thinks you like her son, our only child, that was lost twenty years\nago in the waves of the North Sea.'\n\n'Oh, that alters the case altogether,' said I, 'and of course I can have\nno objection.'\n\nAnd now at once I shook off my listlessness, to enable me to do which\nnothing could have happened more opportune than the above event.  The\nDanes, the Danes!  And was I at last to become acquainted, and in so\nsingular a manner, with the speech of a people which had as far back as I\ncould remember exercised the strongest influence over my imagination, as\nhow should they not!--in infancy there was the summer-eve adventure, to\nwhich I often looked back, and always with a kind of strange interest\nwith respect to those to whom such gigantic and wondrous bones could\nbelong as I had seen on that occasion; and, more than this, I had been in\nIreland, and there, under peculiar circumstances, this same interest was\nincreased tenfold.  I had mingled much whilst there with the genuine\nIrish--a wild but kind-hearted race, whose conversation was deeply imbued\nwith traditionary lore, connected with the early history of their own\nromantic land, and from them I heard enough of the Danes, but nothing\ncommonplace, for they never mentioned them but in terms which tallied\nwell with my own preconceived ideas.  For at an early period the Danes\nhad invaded Ireland, and had subdued it, and, though eventually driven\nout, had left behind them an enduring remembrance in the minds of the\npeople, who loved to speak of their strength and their stature, in\nevidence of which they would point to the ancient raths or mounds where\nthe old Danes were buried, and where bones of extraordinary size were\noccasionally exhumed.  And as the Danes surpassed other people in\nstrength, so, according to my narrators, they also excelled all others in\nwisdom, or rather in Draoitheac, or magic, for they were powerful\nsorcerers, they said, compared with whom the fairy men of the present day\nknew nothing at all, at all; and, amongst other wonderful things, they\nknew how to make strong beer from the heather that grows upon the bogs.\nLittle wonder if the interest, the mysterious interest, which I had early\nfelt about the Danes, was increased tenfold by my sojourn in Ireland.\n\nAnd now I had in my possession a Danish book, which, from its appearance,\nmight be supposed to have belonged to the very old Danes indeed; but how\nwas I to turn it to any account?  I had the book, it is true, but I did\nnot understand the language, and how was I to overcome that difficulty?\nhardly by poring over the book; yet I did pore over the book, daily and\nnightly, till my eyes were dim, and it appeared to me that every now and\nthen I encountered words which I understood--English words, though\nstrangely disguised; and I said to myself, Courage!  English and Danish\nare cognate dialects, a time will come when I shall understand this\nDanish; and then I pored over the book again, but with all my poring I\ncould not understand it; and then I became angry, and I bit my lips till\nthe blood came; and I occasionally tore a handful from my hair, and flung\nit upon the floor, but that did not mend the matter, for still I did not\nunderstand the book, which, however, I began to see was written in\nrhyme--a circumstance rather difficult to discover at first, the\narrangement of the lines not differing from that which is employed in\nprose; and its being written in rhyme made me only the more eager to\nunderstand it.\n\nBut I toiled in vain, for I had neither grammar nor dictionary of the\nlanguage; and when I sought for them could procure neither; and I was\nmuch dispirited, till suddenly a bright thought came into my head, and I\nsaid, although I cannot obtain a dictionary or grammar, I can perhaps\nobtain a Bible in this language, and if I can procure a Bible, I can\nlearn the language, for the Bible in every tongue contains the same\nthing, and I have only to compare the words of the Danish Bible with\nthose of the English, and, if I persevere, I shall in time acquire the\nlanguage of the Danes; and I was pleased with the thought, which I\nconsidered to be a bright one, and I no longer bit my lips, or tore my\nhair, but I took my hat, and, going forth, I flung my hat into the air.\n\nAnd when my hat came down, I put it on my head and commenced running,\ndirecting my course to the house of the Antinomian preacher, who sold\nbooks, and whom I knew to have Bibles in various tongues amongst the\nnumber, and I arrived out of breath, and I found the Antinomian in his\nlittle library, dusting his books; and the Antinomian clergyman was a\ntall man of about seventy, who wore a hat with a broad brim and a shallow\ncrown, and whose manner of speaking was exceedingly nasal; and when I saw\nhim, I cried, out of breath, 'Have you a Danish Bible?' and he replied,\n'What do you want it for, friend?' and I answered, 'To learn Danish by';\n'And maybe to learn thy duty,' replied the Antinomian preacher.  'Truly,\nI have it not, but, as you are a customer of mine, I will endeavour to\nprocure you one, and I will write to that laudable society which men call\nthe Bible Society, an unworthy member of which I am, and I hope by next\nweek to procure what you desire.'\n\nAnd when I heard these words of the old man, I was very glad, and my\nheart yearned towards him, and I would fain enter into conversation with\nhim; and I said, 'Why are you an Antinomian?  For my part I would rather\nbe a dog than belong to such a religion.'  'Nay, friend,' said the\nAntinomian, 'thou forejudgest us; know that those who call us Antinomians\ncall us so despitefully, we do not acknowledge the designation.'  'Then\nyou do not set all law at nought?' said I.  'Far be it from us,' said the\nold man, 'we only hope that, being sanctified by the Spirit from above,\nwe have no need of the law to keep us in order.  Did you ever hear tell\nof Lodowick Muggleton?'  'Not I.'  'That is strange; know then that he\nwas the founder of our poor society, and after him we are frequently,\nthough opprobriously, termed Muggletonians, for we are Christians.  Here\nis his book, which, perhaps, you can do no better than purchase, you are\nfond of rare books, and this is both curious and rare; I will sell it\ncheap.  Thank you, and now be gone, I will do all I can to procure the\nBible.'\n\nAnd in this manner I procured the Danish Bible, and I commenced my task;\nfirst of all, however, I locked up in a closet the volume which had\nexcited my curiosity, saying, 'Out of this closet thou comest not till I\ndeem myself competent to read thee,' and then I sat down in right\nearnest, comparing every line in the one version with the corresponding\none in the other; and I passed entire nights in this manner, till I was\nalmost blind, and the task was tedious enough at first, but I quailed\nnot, and soon began to make progress: and at first I had a misgiving that\nthe old book might not prove a Danish book, but was soon reassured by\nreading many words in the Bible which I remembered to have seen in the\nbook; and then I went on right merrily, and I found that the language\nwhich I was studying was by no means a difficult one, and in less than a\nmonth I deemed myself able to read the book.\n\nAnon, I took the book from the closet, and proceeded to make myself\nmaster of its contents; I had some difficulty, for the language of the\nbook, though in the main the same as the language of the Bible, differed\nfrom it in some points, being apparently a more ancient dialect; by\ndegrees, however, I overcame this difficulty, and I understood the\ncontents of the book, and well did they correspond with all those ideas\nin which I had indulged connected with the Danes.  For the book was a\nbook of ballads, about the deeds of knights and champions, and men of\nhuge stature; ballads which from time immemorial had been sung in the\nNorth, and which some two centuries before the time of which I am\nspeaking had been collected by one Anders Vedel, who lived with a certain\nTycho Brahe, and assisted him in making observations upon the heavenly\nbodies, at a place called Uranias Castle, on the little island of Hveen,\nin the Cattegat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\n\nThe two individuals--The long pipe--The Germans--Werther--The female\nQuaker--Suicide--Gibbon--Jesus of Bethlehem--Fill your\nglass--Shakespeare--English at Minden--Melancholy Swayne Vonved--The\nfifth dinner--Strange doctrines--Are you happy?--Improve yourself in\nGerman.\n\nIt might be some six months after the events last recorded, that two\nindividuals were seated together in a certain room, in a certain street\nof the old town which I have so frequently had occasion to mention in the\npreceding pages; one of them was an elderly, and the other a very young\nman, and they sat on either side of a fireplace, beside a table on which\nwere fruit and wine; the room was a small one, and in its furniture\nexhibited nothing remarkable.  Over the mantelpiece, however, hung a\nsmall picture with naked figures in the foreground, and with much foliage\nbehind.  It might not have struck every beholder, for it looked old and\nsmoke-dried; but a connoisseur, on inspecting it closely, would have\npronounced it to be a judgment of Paris, and a masterpiece of the Flemish\nschool.\n\nThe forehead of the elder individual was high, and perhaps appeared more\nso than it really was, from the hair being carefully brushed back, as if\nfor the purpose of displaying to the best advantage that part of the\ncranium; his eyes were large and full, and of a light brown, and might\nhave been called heavy and dull, had they not been occasionally lighted\nup by a sudden gleam--not so brilliant however as that which at every\ninhalation shone from the bowl of the long clay pipe which he was\nsmoking, but which, from a certain sucking sound which about this time\nbegan to be heard from the bottom, appeared to be giving notice that it\nwould soon require replenishment from a certain canister, which, together\nwith a lighted taper, stood upon the table beside him.\n\n'You do not smoke?' said he, at length, laying down his pipe, and\ndirecting his glance to his companion.\n\nNow there was at least one thing singular connected with this last,\nnamely, the colour of his hair, which, notwithstanding his extreme youth,\nappeared to be rapidly becoming gray.  He had very long limbs, and was\napparently tall of stature, in which he differed from his elderly\ncompanion, who must have been somewhat below the usual height.\n\n'No, I can't smoke,' said the youth, in reply to the observation of the\nother; 'I have often tried, but could never succeed to my satisfaction.'\n\n'Is it possible to become a good German without smoking?' said the\nsenior, half speaking to himself.\n\n'I daresay not,' said the youth; 'but I shan't break my heart on that\naccount.'\n\n'As for breaking your heart, of course you would never think of such a\nthing; he is a fool who breaks his heart on any account; but it is good\nto be a German, the Germans are the most philosophic people in the world,\nand the greatest smokers: now I trace their philosophy to their smoking.'\n\n'I have heard say their philosophy is all smoke--is that your opinion?'\n\n'Why, no; but smoking has a sedative effect upon the nerves, and enables\na man to bear the sorrows of this life (of which every one has his share)\nnot only decently, but dignifiedly.  Suicide is not a national habit in\nGermany as it is in England.'\n\n'But that poor creature, Werther, who committed suicide, was a German.'\n\n'Werther is a fictitious character, and by no means a felicitous one; I\nam no admirer either of Werther or his author.  But I should say that, if\nthere ever was a Werther in Germany, he did not smoke.  Werther, as you\nvery justly observe, was a poor creature.'\n\n'And a very sinful one; I have heard my parents say that suicide is a\ngreat crime.'\n\n'Broadly, and without qualification, to say that suicide is a crime, is\nspeaking somewhat unphilosophically.  No doubt suicide, under many\ncircumstances, is a crime, a very heinous one.  When the father of a\nfamily, for example, to escape from certain difficulties, commits\nsuicide, he commits a crime; there are those around him who look to him\nfor support, by the law of nature, and he has no right to withdraw\nhimself from those who have a claim upon his exertions; he is a person\nwho decamps with other people's goods as well as his own.  Indeed, there\ncan be no crime which is not founded upon the depriving others of\nsomething which belongs to them.  A man is hanged for setting fire to his\nhouse in a crowded city, for he burns at the same time or damages those\nof other people; but if a man who has a house on a heath sets fire to it,\nhe is not hanged, for he has not damaged or endangered any other\nindividual's property, and the principle of revenge, upon which all\npunishment is founded, has not been aroused.  Similar to such a case is\nthat of the man who, without any family ties, commits suicide; for\nexample, were I to do the thing this evening, who would have a right to\ncall me to account?  I am alone in the world, have no family to support,\nand, so far from damaging any one, should even benefit my heir by my\naccelerated death.  However, I am no advocate for suicide under any\ncircumstances; there is something undignified in it, unheroic,\nun-Germanic.  But if you must commit suicide--and there is no knowing to\nwhat people may be brought--always contrive to do it as decorously as\npossible; the decencies, whether of life or of death, should never be\nlost sight of.  I remember a female Quaker who committed suicide by\ncutting her throat, but she did it decorously and decently: kneeling down\nover a pail, so that not one drop fell upon the floor; thus exhibiting in\nher last act that nice sense of neatness for which Quakers are\ndistinguished.  I have always had a respect for that woman's memory.'\n\nAnd here, filling his pipe from the canister, and lighting it at the\ntaper, he recommenced smoking calmly and sedately.\n\n'But is not suicide forbidden in the Bible?' the youth demanded.\n\n'Why, no; but what though it were!--the Bible is a respectable book, but\nI should hardly call it one whose philosophy is of the soundest.  I have\nsaid that it is a respectable book; I mean respectable from its\nantiquity, and from containing, as Herder says, \"the earliest records of\nthe human race,\" though those records are far from being dispassionately\nwritten, on which account they are of less value than they otherwise\nmight have been.  There is too much passion in the Bible, too much\nviolence; now, to come to all truth, especially historic truth, requires\ncool dispassionate investigation, for which the Jews do not appear to\nhave ever been famous.  We are ourselves not famous for it, for we are a\npassionate people; the Germans are not--they are not a passionate\npeople--a people celebrated for their oaths; we are.  The Germans have\nmany excellent historic writers, we . . . 'tis true we have Gibbon . . .\nYou have been reading Gibbon--what do you think of him?'\n\n'I think him a very wonderful writer.'\n\n'He is a wonderful writer--one _sui generis_--uniting the perspicuity of\nthe English--for we are perspicuous--with the cool dispassionate\nreasoning of the Germans.  Gibbon sought after the truth, found it, and\nmade it clear.'\n\n'Then you think Gibbon a truthful writer?'\n\n'Why, yes; who shall convict Gibbon of falsehood?  Many people have\nendeavoured to convict Gibbon of falsehood; they have followed him in his\nresearches, and have never found him once tripping.  Oh, he is a\nwonderful writer! his power of condensation is admirable; the lore of the\nwhole world is to be found in his pages.  Sometimes in a single note he\nhas given us the result of the study of years; or, to speak\nmetaphorically, \"he has ransacked a thousand Gulistans, and has condensed\nall his fragrant booty into a single drop of otto.\"'\n\n'But was not Gibbon an enemy to the Christian faith?'\n\n'Why, no; he was rather an enemy to priestcraft, so am I; and when I say\nthe philosophy of the Bible is in many respects unsound, I always wish to\nmake an exception in favour of that part of it which contains the life\nand sayings of Jesus of Bethlehem, to which I must always concede my\nunqualified admiration--of Jesus, mind you; for with his followers and\ntheir dogmas I have nothing to do.  Of all historic characters Jesus is\nthe most beautiful and the most heroic.  I have always been a friend to\nhero-worship, it is the only rational one, and has always been in use\namongst civilised people--the worship of spirits is synonymous with\nbarbarism--it is mere fetish; the savages of West Africa are all spirit-\nworshippers.  But there is something philosophic in the worship of the\nheroes of the human race, and the true hero is the benefactor.  Brahma,\nJupiter, Bacchus, were all benefactors, and, therefore, entitled to the\nworship of their respective peoples.  The Celts worshipped Hesus, who\ntaught them to plough, a highly useful art.  We, who have attained a much\nhigher state of civilisation than the Celts ever did, worship Jesus, the\nfirst who endeavoured to teach men to behave decently and decorously\nunder all circumstances; who was the foe of vengeance, in which there is\nsomething highly indecorous; who had first the courage to lift his voice\nagainst that violent dogma, \"an eye for an eye\"; who shouted conquer, but\nconquer with kindness; who said put up the sword, a violent unphilosophic\nweapon; and who finally died calmly and decorously in defence of his\nphilosophy.  He must be a savage who denies worship to the hero of\nGolgotha.'\n\n'But he was something more than a hero; he was the Son of God, wasn't\nhe?'\n\nThe elderly individual made no immediate answer; but, after a few more\nwhiffs from his pipe, exclaimed, 'Come, fill your glass!  How do you\nadvance with your translation of _Tell_'?\n\n'It is nearly finished; but I do not think I shall proceed with it; I\nbegin to think the original somewhat dull.'\n\n'There you are wrong; it is the masterpiece of Schiller, the first of\nGerman poets.'\n\n'It may be so,' said the youth.  'But, pray excuse me, I do not think\nvery highly of German poetry.  I have lately been reading Shakespeare;\nand, when I turn from him to the Germans--even the best of them--they\nappear mere pigmies.  You will pardon the liberty I perhaps take in\nsaying so.'\n\n'I like that every one should have an opinion of his own,' said the\nelderly individual; 'and, what is more, declare it.  Nothing displeases\nme more than to see people assenting to everything that they hear said; I\nat once come to the conclusion that they are either hypocrites, or there\nis nothing in them.  But, with respect to Shakespeare, whom I have not\nread for thirty years, is he not rather given to bombast, \"crackling\nbombast,\" as I think I have said in one of my essays?'\n\n'I daresay he is,' said the youth; 'but I can't help thinking him the\ngreatest of all poets, not even excepting Homer.  I would sooner have\nwritten that series of plays, founded on the fortunes of the House of\nLancaster, than the _Iliad_ itself.  The events described are as lofty as\nthose sung by Homer in his great work, and the characters brought upon\nthe stage still more interesting.  I think Hotspur as much of a hero as\nHector, and young Henry more of a man than Achilles; and then there is\nthe fat knight, the quintessence of fun, wit, and rascality.  Falstaff is\na creation beyond the genius even of Homer.'\n\n'You almost tempt me to read Shakespeare again--but the Germans?'\n\n'I don't admire the Germans,' said the youth, somewhat excited.  'I don't\nadmire them in any point of view.  I have heard my father say that,\nthough good sharpshooters, they can't be much depended upon as soldiers;\nand that old Sergeant Meredith told him that Minden would never have been\nwon but for the two English regiments, who charged the French with fixed\nbayonets, and sent them to the right-about in double-quick time.  With\nrespect to poetry, setting Shakespeare and the English altogether aside,\nI think there is another Gothic nation, at least, entitled to dispute\nwith them the palm.  Indeed, to my mind, there is more genuine poetry\ncontained in the old Danish book which I came so strangely by, than has\nbeen produced in Germany from the period of the Niebelungen lay to the\npresent.'\n\n'Ah, the Koempe Viser?' said the elderly individual, breathing forth an\nimmense volume of smoke, which he had been collecting during the\ndeclamation of his young companion.  'There are singular things in that\nbook, I must confess; and I thank you for showing it to me, or rather\nyour attempt at translation.  I was struck with that ballad of Orm\nUngarswayne, who goes by night to the grave-hill of his father to seek\nfor counsel.  And then, again, that strange melancholy Swayne Vonved, who\nroams about the world propounding people riddles; slaying those who\ncannot answer, and rewarding those who can with golden bracelets.  Were\nit not for the violence, I should say that ballad has a philosophic\ntendency.  I thank you for making me acquainted with the book, and I\nthank the Jew Mousha for making me acquainted with you.'\n\n'That Mousha was a strange customer,' said the youth, collecting himself.\n\n'He _was_ a strange customer,' said the elder individual, breathing forth\na gentle cloud.  'I love to exercise hospitality to wandering strangers,\nespecially foreigners; and when he came to this place, pretending to\nteach German and Hebrew, I asked him to dinner.  After the first dinner,\nhe asked me to lend him five pounds; I _did_ lend him five pounds.  After\nthe fifth dinner, he asked me to lend him fifty pounds; I did _not_ lend\nhim the fifty pounds.'\n\n'He was as ignorant of German as of Hebrew,' said the youth; 'on which\naccount he was soon glad, I suppose, to transfer his pupil to some one\nelse.'\n\n'He told me,' said the elder individual, 'that he intended to leave a\ntown where he did not find sufficient encouragement; and, at the same\ntime, expressed regret at being obliged to abandon a certain\nextraordinary pupil, for whom he had a particular regard.  Now I, who\nhave taught many people German from the love which I bear to it, and the\ndesire which I feel that it should be generally diffused, instantly said\nthat I should be happy to take his pupil off his hands, and afford him\nwhat instruction I could in German, for, as to Hebrew, I have never taken\nmuch interest in it.  Such was the origin of our acquaintance.  You have\nbeen an apt scholar.  Of late, however, I have seen little of you--what\nis the reason?'\n\nThe youth made no answer.\n\n'You think, probably, that you have learned all I can teach you?  Well,\nperhaps you are right.'\n\n'Not so, not so,' said the young man eagerly; 'before I knew you I knew\nnothing, and am still very ignorant; but of late my father's health has\nbeen very much broken, and he requires attention; his spirits also have\nbecome low, which, to tell you the truth, he attributes to my misconduct.\nHe says that I have imbibed all kinds of strange notions and doctrines,\nwhich will, in all probability, prove my ruin, both here and hereafter;\nwhich--which--'\n\n'Ah!  I understand,' said the elder, with another calm whiff.  'I have\nalways had a kind of respect for your father, for there is something\nremarkable in his appearance, something heroic, and I would fain have\ncultivated his acquaintance; the feeling, however, has not been\nreciprocated.  I met him, the other day, up the road, with his cane and\ndog, and saluted him; he did not return my salutation.'\n\n'He has certain opinions of his own,' said the youth, 'which are widely\ndifferent from those which he has heard that you profess.'\n\n'I respect a man for entertaining an opinion of his own,' said the\nelderly individual.  'I hold certain opinions; but I should not respect\nan individual the more for adopting them.  All I wish for is tolerance,\nwhich I myself endeavour to practise.  I have always loved the truth, and\nsought it; if I have not found it, the greater my misfortune.'\n\n'Are you happy?' said the young man.\n\n'Why, no!  And, between ourselves, it is that which induces me to doubt\nsometimes the truth of my opinions.  My life, upon the whole, I consider\na failure; on which account, I would not counsel you, or any one, to\nfollow my example too closely.  It is getting late, and you had better be\ngoing, especially as your father, you say, is anxious about you.  But, as\nwe may never meet again, I think there are three things which I may\nsafely venture to press upon you.  The first is, that the decencies and\ngentlenesses should never be lost sight of, as the practice of the\ndecencies and gentlenesses is at all times compatible with independence\nof thought and action.  The second thing which I would wish to impress\nupon you is, that there is always some eye upon us; and that it is\nimpossible to keep anything we do from the world, as it will assuredly be\ndivulged by somebody as soon as it is his interest to do so.  The third\nthing which I would wish to press upon you--'\n\n'Yes,' said the youth, eagerly bending forward.\n\n'Is--' and here the elderly individual laid down his pipe upon the\ntable--'that it will be as well to go on improving yourself in German!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\n\nThe alehouse-keeper--Compassion for the rich--Old English gentleman--How\nis this?--Madeira--The Greek Parr--Twenty languages--Whiter's\nhealth--About the fight--A sporting gentleman--The flattened nose--Lend\nus that pightle--The surly nod.\n\n'Holloa, master! can you tell us where the fight is likely to be?'\n\nSuch were the words shouted out to me by a short thick fellow, in brown\ntop-boots, and bareheaded, who stood, with his hands in his pockets, at\nthe door of a country alehouse as I was passing by.\n\nNow, as I knew nothing about the fight, and as the appearance of the man\ndid not tempt me greatly to enter into conversation with him, I merely\nanswered in the negative, and continued my way.\n\nIt was a fine lovely morning in May, the sun shone bright above, and the\nbirds were carolling in the hedgerows.  I was wont to be cheerful at such\nseasons, for, from my earliest recollection, sunshine and the song of\nbirds have been dear to me; yet, about that period, I was not cheerful,\nmy mind was not at rest; I was debating within myself, and the debate was\ndreary and unsatisfactory enough.  I sighed, and turning my eyes upward,\nI ejaculated, 'What is truth?'\n\nBut suddenly, by a violent effort breaking away from my meditations, I\nhastened forward; one mile, two miles, three miles were speedily left\nbehind; and now I came to a grove of birch and other trees, and opening a\ngate I passed up a kind of avenue, and soon arriving before a large brick\nhouse, of rather antique appearance, knocked at the door.\n\nIn this house there lived a gentleman with whom I had business.  He was\nsaid to be a genuine old English gentleman, and a man of considerable\nproperty; at this time, however, he wanted a thousand pounds, as\ngentlemen of considerable property every now and then do.  I had brought\nhim a thousand pounds in my pocket, for it is astonishing how many eager\nhelpers the rich find, and with what compassion people look upon their\ndistresses.  He was said to have good wine in his cellar.\n\n'Is your master at home?' said I, to a servant who appeared at the door.\n\n'His worship is at home, young man,' said the servant, as he looked at my\nshoes, which bore evidence that I had come walking.  'I beg your pardon,\nsir,' he added, as he looked me in the face.\n\n'Ay, ay, servants,' thought I, as I followed the man into the house,\n'always look people in the face when you open the door, and do so before\nyou look at their shoes, or you may mistake the heir of a Prime Minister\nfor a shopkeeper's son.'\n\nI found his worship a jolly, red-faced gentleman, of about fifty-five; he\nwas dressed in a green coat, white corduroy breeches, and drab gaiters,\nand sat on an old-fashioned leather sofa, with two small, thoroughbred,\nblack English terriers, one on each side of him.  He had all the\nappearance of a genuine old English gentleman who kept good wine in his\ncellar.\n\n'Sir,' said I, 'I have brought you a thousand pounds'; and I said this\nafter the servant had retired, and the two terriers had ceased the\nbarking which is natural to all such dogs at the sight of a stranger.\n\nAnd when the magistrate had received the money, and signed and returned a\ncertain paper which I handed to him, he rubbed his hands, and looking\nvery benignantly at me, exclaimed--\n\n'And now, young gentleman, that our business is over, perhaps you can\ntell me where the fight is to take place?'\n\n'I am sorry, sir,' said I, 'that I can't inform you, but everybody seems\nto be anxious about it'; and then I told him what had occurred to me on\nthe road with the alehouse-keeper.\n\n'I know him,' said his worship; 'he's a tenant of mine, and a good\nfellow, somewhat too much in my debt though.  But how is this, young\ngentleman, you look as if you had been walking; you did not come on\nfoot?'\n\n'Yes, sir, I came on foot.'\n\n'On foot! why it is sixteen miles.'\n\n'I shan't be tired when I have walked back.'\n\n'You can't ride, I suppose?'\n\n'Better than I can walk.'\n\n'Then why do you walk?'\n\n'I have frequently to make journeys connected with my profession;\nsometimes I walk, sometimes I ride, just as the whim takes me.'\n\n'Will you take a glass of wine?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'That's right; what shall it be?'\n\n'Madeira!'\n\nThe magistrate gave a violent slap on his knee; 'I like your taste,' said\nhe, 'I am fond of a glass of Madeira myself, and can give you such a one\nas you will not drink every day; sit down, young gentleman, you shall\nhave a glass of Madeira, and the best I have.'\n\nThereupon he got up, and, followed by his two terriers, walked slowly out\nof the room.\n\nI looked round the room, and, seeing nothing which promised me much\namusement, I sat down, and fell again into my former train of thought.\n'What is truth?' said I.\n\n'Here it is,' said the magistrate, returning at the end of a quarter of\nan hour, followed by the servant with a tray; 'here's the true thing, or\nI am no judge, far less a justice.  It has been thirty years in my cellar\nlast Christmas.  There,' said he to the servant, 'put it down, and leave\nmy young friend and me to ourselves.  Now, what do you think of it?'\n\n'It is very good,' said I.\n\n'Did you ever taste better Madeira?'\n\n'I never before tasted Madeira.'\n\n'Then you ask for a wine without knowing what it is?'\n\n'I ask for it, sir, that I may know what it is.'\n\n'Well, there is logic in that, as Parr would say; you have heard of\nParr?'\n\n'Old Parr?'\n\n'Yes, old Parr, but not that Parr; you mean the English, I the Greek\nParr, as people call him.'\n\n'I don't know him.'\n\n'Perhaps not--rather too young for that, but were you of my age, you\nmight have cause to know him, coming from where you do.  He kept school\nthere, I was his first scholar; he flogged Greek into me till I loved\nhim--and he loved me: he came to see me last year, and sat in that chair;\nI honour Parr--he knows much, and is a sound man.'\n\n'Does he know the truth?'\n\n'Know the truth! he knows what's good, from an oyster to an ostrich--he's\nnot only sound, but round.'\n\n'Suppose we drink his health?'\n\n'Thank you, boy: here's Parr's health, and Whiter's.'\n\n'Who is Whiter?'\n\n'Don't you know Whiter?  I thought everybody knew Reverend Whiter the\nphilologist, though I suppose you scarcely know what that means.  A man\nfond of tongues and languages, quite out of your way--he understands some\ntwenty; what do you say to that?'\n\n'Is he a sound man?'\n\n'Why, as to that, I scarcely know what to say: he has got queer notions\nin his head--wrote a book to prove that all words came originally from\nthe earth--who knows?  Words have roots, and roots live in the earth;\nbut, upon the whole, I should not call him altogether a sound man, though\nhe can talk Greek nearly as fast as Parr.'\n\n'Is he a round man?'\n\n'Ay, boy, rounder than Parr; I'll sing you a song, if you like, which\nwill let you into his character:--\n\n   'Give me the haunch of a buck to eat, and to drink Madeira old,\n   And a gentle wife to rest with, and in my arms to fold,\n   An Arabic book to study, a Norfolk cob to ride,\n   And a house to live in shaded with trees, and near to a river side;\n   With such good things around me, and blessed with good health withal,\n   Though I should live for a hundred years, for death I would not call.\n\nHere's to Whiter's health--so you know nothing about the fight?'\n\n'No, sir; the truth is, that of late I have been very much occupied with\nvarious matters, otherwise I should, perhaps, have been able to afford\nyou some information--boxing is a noble art.'\n\n'Can you box?'\n\n'A little.'\n\n'I tell you what, my boy; I honour you, and provided your education had\nbeen a little less limited, I should have been glad to see you here in\ncompany with Parr and Whiter; both can box.  Boxing is, as you say, a\nnoble art--a truly English art; may I never see the day when Englishmen\nshall feel ashamed of it, or blacklegs and blackguards bring it into\ndisgrace.  I am a magistrate, and, of course, cannot patronise the thing\nvery openly, yet I sometimes see a prize fight: I saw the Game Chicken\nbeat Gulley.'\n\n'Did you ever see Big Ben?'\n\n'No; why do you ask?'  But here we heard a noise, like that of a gig\ndriving up to the door, which was immediately succeeded by a violent\nknocking and ringing, and after a little time the servant who had\nadmitted me made his appearance in the room.  'Sir,' said he, with a\ncertain eagerness of manner, 'here are two gentlemen waiting to speak to\nyou.'\n\n'Gentlemen waiting to speak to me! who are they?'\n\n'I don't know, sir,' said the servant; 'but they look like sporting\ngentlemen, and--and'--here he hesitated; 'from a word or two they\ndropped, I almost think that they come about the fight.'\n\n'About the fight!' said the magistrate.  'No; that can hardly be;\nhowever, you had better show them in.'\n\nHeavy steps were now heard ascending the stairs, and the servant ushered\ntwo men into the apartment.  Again there was a barking, but louder than\nthat which had been directed against myself, for here were two intruders;\nboth of them were remarkable-looking men, but to the foremost of them the\nmost particular notice may well be accorded: he was a man somewhat under\nthirty, and nearly six feet in height.  He was dressed in a blue coat,\nwhite corduroy breeches, fastened below the knee with small golden\nbuttons; on his legs he wore white lamb's-wool stockings, and on his feet\nshoes reaching to the ankles; round his neck was a handkerchief of the\nblue and bird's eye pattern; he wore neither whiskers nor moustaches, and\nappeared not to delight in hair, that of his head, which was of a light\nbrown, being closely cropped; the forehead was rather high, but somewhat\nnarrow; the face neither broad nor sharp, perhaps rather sharp than\nbroad; the nose was almost delicate; the eyes were gray, with an\nexpression in which there was sternness blended with something\napproaching to feline; his complexion was exceedingly pale, relieved,\nhowever, by certain pock-marks, which here and there studded his\ncountenance; his form was athletic, but lean; his arms long.  In the\nwhole appearance of the man there was a blending of the bluff and the\nsharp.  You might have supposed him a bruiser; his dress was that of one\nin all its minutiae; something was wanting, however, in his manner--the\nquietness of the professional man; he rather looked like one performing\nthe part--well--very well--but still performing a part.  His\ncompanion!--there, indeed, was the bruiser--no mistake about him: a tall\nmassive man, with a broad countenance and a flattened nose; dressed like\na bruiser, but not like a bruiser going into the ring; he wore\nwhite-topped boots, and a loose brown jockey coat.\n\nAs the first advanced towards the table, behind which the magistrate sat,\nhe doffed a white castor from his head, and made rather a genteel bow;\nlooking at me, who sat somewhat on one side, he gave a kind of nod of\nrecognition.\n\n'May I request to know who you are, gentlemen?' said the magistrate.\n\n'Sir,' said the man in a deep, but not unpleasant voice, 'allow me to\nintroduce to you my friend, Mr. ---, the celebrated pugilist'; and he\nmotioned with his hand towards the massive man with the flattened nose.\n\n'And your own name, sir?' said the magistrate.\n\n'My name is no matter,' said the man; 'were I to mention it to you, it\nwould awaken within you no feeling of interest.  It is neither Kean nor\nBelcher, and I have as yet done nothing to distinguish myself like either\nof those individuals, or even like my friend here.  However, a time may\ncome--we are not yet buried; and whensoever my hour arrives, I hope I\nshall prove myself equal to my destiny, however high--\n\n   'Like bird that's bred amongst the Helicons.'\n\nAnd here a smile half theatrical passed over his features.\n\n'In what can I oblige you, sir?' said the magistrate.\n\n'Well, sir; the soul of wit is brevity; we want a place for an\napproaching combat between my friend here and a brave from town.  Passing\nby your broad acres this fine morning we saw a pightle, which we deemed\nwould suit.  Lend us that pightle, and receive our thanks; 'twould be a\nfavour, though not much to grant: we neither ask for Stonehenge nor for\nTempe.'\n\nMy friend looked somewhat perplexed; after a moment, however, he said,\nwith a firm but gentlemanly air, 'Sir, I am sorry that I cannot comply\nwith your request.'\n\n'Not comply!' said the man, his brow becoming dark as midnight; and with\na hoarse and savage tone, 'Not comply! why not?'\n\n'It is impossible, sir; utterly impossible!'\n\n'Why so?'\n\n'I am not compelled to give my reasons to you, sir, nor to any man.'\n\n'Let me beg of you to alter your decision,' said the man, in a tone of\nprofound respect.\n\n'Utterly impossible, sir; I am a magistrate.'\n\n'Magistrate! then fare ye well, for a green-coated buffer and a\nHarmanbeck.'\n\n'Sir!' said the magistrate, springing up with a face fiery with wrath.\n\nBut, with a surly nod to me, the man left the apartment; and in a moment\nmore the heavy footsteps of himself and his companion were heard\ndescending the staircase.\n\n'Who is that man?' said my friend, turning towards me.\n\n'A sporting gentleman, well known in the place from which I come.'\n\n'He appeared to know you.'\n\n'I have occasionally put on the gloves with him.'\n\n'What is his name?'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\n\nDoubts--Wise king of Jerusalem--Let me see--A thousand years--Nothing\nnew--The crowd--The hymn--Faith--Charles Wesley--There he stood--Farewell,\nbrother--Death--Sun, moon, and stars--Wind on the heath.\n\nThere was one question which I was continually asking myself at this\nperiod, and which has more than once met the eyes of the reader who has\nfollowed me through the last chapter: 'What is truth?'  I had involved\nmyself imperceptibly in a dreary labyrinth of doubt, and, whichever way I\nturned, no reasonable prospect of extricating myself appeared.  The means\nby which I had brought myself into this situation may be very briefly\ntold; I had inquired into many matters, in order that I might become\nwise, and I had read and pondered over the words of the wise, so called,\ntill I had made myself master of the sum of human wisdom; namely, that\neverything is enigmatical and that man is an enigma to himself; thence\nthe cry of 'What is truth?'  I had ceased to believe in the truth of that\nin which I had hitherto trusted, and yet could find nothing in which I\ncould put any fixed or deliberate belief--I was, indeed, in a labyrinth!\nIn what did I not doubt?  With respect to crime and virtue I was in\ndoubt; I doubted that the one was blamable and the other praiseworthy.\nAre not all things subjected to the law of necessity?  Assuredly time and\nchance govern all things: Yet how can this be? alas!\n\nThen there was myself; for what was I born?  Are not all things born to\nbe forgotten?  That's incomprehensible: yet is it not so?  Those\nbutterflies fall and are forgotten.  In what is man better than a\nbutterfly?  All then is born to be forgotten.  Ah! that was a pang\nindeed; 'tis at such a moment that a man wishes to die.  The wise king of\nJerusalem, who sat in his shady arbours beside his sunny fish-pools,\nsaying so many fine things, wished to die, when he saw that not only all\nwas vanity, but that he himself was vanity.  Will a time come when all\nwill be forgotten that now is beneath the sun?  If so, of what profit is\nlife?\n\nIn truth it was a sore vexation of spirit to me when I saw, as the wise\nman saw of old, that whatever I could hope to perform must necessarily be\nof very temporary duration; and if so, why do it?  I said to myself,\nwhatever name I can acquire, will it endure for eternity? scarcely so.  A\nthousand years?  Let me see! what have I done already?  I have learnt\nWelsh, and have translated the songs of Ab Gwilym, some ten thousand\nlines, into English rhyme; I have also learnt Danish, and have rendered\nthe old book of ballads cast by the tempest upon the beach into\ncorresponding English metre.  Good! have I done enough already to secure\nmyself a reputation of a thousand years?  No, no! certainly not; I have\nnot the slightest ground for hoping that my translations from the Welsh\nand Danish will be read at the end of a thousand years.  Well, but I am\nonly eighteen, and I have not stated all that I have done; I have learnt\nmany other tongues, and have acquired some knowledge even of Hebrew and\nArabic.  Should I go on in this way till I am forty, I must then be very\nlearned; and perhaps, among other things, may have translated the Talmud,\nand some of the great works of the Arabians.  Pooh! all this is mere\nlearning and translation, and such will never secure immortality.\nTranslation is at best an echo, and it must be a wonderful echo to be\nheard after the lapse of a thousand years.  No! all I have already done,\nand all I may yet do in the same way, I may reckon as nothing--mere\npastime; something else must be done.  I must either write some grand\noriginal work, or conquer an empire; the one just as easy as the other.\nBut am I competent to do either?  Yes, I think I am, under favourable\ncircumstances.  Yes, I think I may promise myself a reputation of a\nthousand years, if I do but give myself the necessary trouble.  Well! but\nwhat's a thousand years after all, or twice a thousand years?  Woe is me!\nI may just as well sit still.\n\n'Would I had never been born!' I said to myself; and a thought would\noccasionally intrude: But was I ever born?  Is not all that I see a lie--a\ndeceitful phantom?  Is there a world, and earth, and sky?  Berkeley's\ndoctrine--Spinoza's doctrine!  Dear reader, I had at that time never read\neither Berkeley or Spinoza.  I have still never read them; who are they,\nmen of yesterday?  'All is a lie--all a deceitful phantom,' are old\ncries; they come naturally from the mouths of those who, casting aside\nthat choicest shield against madness, simplicity, would fain be wise as\nGod, and can only know that they are naked.  This doubting in the\n'universal all' is almost coeval with the human race: wisdom, so called,\nwas early sought after.  All is a lie--a deceitful phantom--was said when\nthe world was yet young; its surface, save a scanty portion, yet\nuntrodden by human foot, and when the great tortoise yet crawled about.\nAll is a lie, was the doctrine of Buddh; and Buddh lived thirty centuries\nbefore the wise king of Jerusalem, who sat in his arbours, beside his\nsunny fish-pools, saying many fine things, and, amongst others, 'There is\nnothing new under the sun!'\n\n* * * * *\n\nOne day, whilst I bent my way to the heath of which I have spoken on a\nformer occasion, at the foot of the hills which formed it I came to a\nplace where a wagon was standing, but without horses, the shafts resting\non the ground; there was a crowd about it, which extended half-way up the\nside of the neighbouring hill.  The wagon was occupied by some half a\ndozen men; some sitting, others standing--they were dressed in\nsober-coloured habiliments of black or brown, cut in a plain and rather\nuncouth fashion, and partially white with dust; their hair was short, and\nseemed to have been smoothed down by the application of the hand; all\nwere bareheaded--sitting or standing, all were bareheaded.  One of them,\na tall man, was speaking as I arrived; ere, however, I could distinguish\nwhat he was saying, he left off, and then there was a cry for a hymn 'to\nthe glory of God'--that was the word.  It was a strange-sounding hymn, as\nwell it might be, for everybody joined in it: there were voices of all\nkinds, of men, of women, and of children--of those who could sing and of\nthose who could not--a thousand voices all joined, and all joined\nheartily; no voice of all the multitude was silent save mine.  The crowd\nconsisted entirely of the lower classes, labourers and mechanics, and\ntheir wives and children--dusty people, unwashed people, people of no\naccount whatever, and yet they did not look a mob.  And when that hymn\nwas over--and here let me observe that, strange as it sounded, I have\nrecalled that hymn to mind, and it has seemed to tingle in my ears on\noccasions when all that pomp and art could do to enhance religious\nsolemnity was being done--in the Sistine Chapel, what time the papal band\nwas in full play, and the choicest choristers of Italy poured forth their\nmellowest tones in presence of Batuschca and his cardinals--on the ice of\nthe Neva, what time the long train of stately priests, with their noble\nbeards and their flowing robes of crimson and gold, with their ebony and\nivory staves, stalked along, chanting their Sclavonian litanies in\nadvance of the mighty Emperor of the North and his Priberjensky guard of\ngiants, towards the orifice through which the river, running below in its\nswiftness, is to receive the baptismal lymph:--when the hymn was over,\nanother man in the wagon proceeded to address the people; he was a much\nyounger man than the last speaker; somewhat square built and about the\nmiddle height; his face was rather broad, but expressive of much\nintelligence, and with a peculiar calm and serious look; the accent in\nwhich he spoke indicated that he was not of these parts, but from some\ndistant district.  The subject of his address was faith, and how it could\nremove mountains.  It was a plain address, without any attempt at\nornament, and delivered in a tone which was neither loud nor vehement.\nThe speaker was evidently not a practised one--once or twice he hesitated\nas if for words to express his meaning, but still he held on, talking of\nfaith, and how it could remove mountains: 'It is the only thing we want,\nbrethren, in this world; if we have that, we are indeed rich, as it will\nenable us to do our duty under all circumstances, and to bear our lot,\nhowever hard it may be--and the lot of all mankind is hard--the lot of\nthe poor is hard, brethren--and who knows more of the poor than I?--a\npoor man myself, and the son of a poor man: but are the rich better off?\nnot so, brethren, for God is just.  The rich have their trials too: I am\nnot rich myself, but I have seen the rich with careworn countenances; I\nhave also seen them in madhouses; from which you may learn, brethren,\nthat the lot of all mankind is hard; that is, till we lay hold of faith,\nwhich makes us comfortable under all circumstances; whether we ride in\ngilded chariots or walk barefooted in quest of bread; whether we be\nignorant, whether we be wise--for riches and poverty, ignorance and\nwisdom, brethren, each brings with it its peculiar temptations.  Well,\nunder all these troubles, the thing which I would recommend you to seek\nis one and the same--faith; faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, who made us\nand allotted to each his station.  Each has something to do, brethren.  Do\nit, therefore, but always in faith; without faith we shall find ourselves\nsometimes at fault; but with faith never--for faith can remove the\ndifficulty.  It will teach us to love life, brethren, when life is\nbecoming bitter, and to prize the blessings around us; for as every man\nhas his cares, brethren, so has each man his blessings.  It will likewise\nteach us not to love life over much, seeing that we must one day part\nwith it.  It will teach us to face death with resignation, and will\npreserve us from sinking amidst the swelling of the river Jordan.'\n\nAnd when he had concluded his address, he said, 'Let us sing a hymn, one\ncomposed by Master Charles Wesley--he was my countryman, brethren.\n\n   'Jesus, I cast my soul on Thee,\n   Mighty and merciful to save;\n   Thou shalt to death go down with me,\n   And lay me gently in the grave.\n   This body then shall rest in hope,\n   This body which the worms destroy;\n   For Thou shalt surely raise me up\n   To glorious life and endless joy.'\n\nFarewell, preacher with the plain coat and the calm serious look!  I saw\nthee once again, and that was lately--only the other day.  It was near a\nfishing hamlet, by the sea-side, that I saw the preacher again.  He stood\non the top of a steep monticle, used by pilots as a look-out for vessels\napproaching that coast, a dangerous one, abounding in rocks and quick-\nsands.  There he stood on the monticle, preaching to weather-worn\nfishermen and mariners gathered below upon the sand.  'Who is he?' said I\nto an old fisherman who stood beside me with a book of hymns in his hand;\nbut the old man put his hand to his lips, and that was the only answer I\nreceived.  Not a sound was heard but the voice of the preacher and the\nroaring of the waves; but the voice was heard loud above the roaring of\nthe sea, for the preacher now spoke with power, and his voice was not\nthat of one who hesitates.  There he stood--no longer a young man, for\nhis black locks were become gray, even like my own; but there was the\nintelligent face, and the calm serious look which had struck me of yore.\nThere stood the preacher, one of those men--and, thank God, their number\nis not few--who, animated by the spirit of Christ, amidst much poverty,\nand, alas! much contempt, persist in carrying the light of the Gospel\namidst the dark parishes of what, but for their instrumentality, would\nscarcely be Christian England.  I would have waited till he had\nconcluded, in order that I might speak to him, and endeavour to bring\nback the ancient scene to his recollection, but suddenly a man came\nhurrying towards the monticle, mounted on a speedy horse, and holding by\nthe bridle one yet more speedy, and he whispered to me, 'Why loiterest\nthou here?--knowest thou not all that is to be done before midnight?' and\nhe flung me the bridle; and I mounted on the horse of great speed, and I\nfollowed the other, who had already galloped off.  And as I departed, I\nwaved my hand to him on the monticle, and I shouted, 'Farewell, brother!\nthe seed came up at last, after a long period!' and then I gave the\nspeedy horse his way, and leaning over the shoulder of the galloping\nhorse, I said, 'Would that my life had been like his--even like that\nman's!'\n\nI now wandered along the heath, till I came to a place where, beside a\nthick furze, sat a man, his eyes fixed intently on the red ball of the\nsetting sun.\n\n'That's not you, Jasper?'\n\n'Indeed, brother!'\n\n'I've not seen you for years.'\n\n'How should you, brother?'\n\n'What brings you here?'\n\n'The fight, brother.'\n\n'Where are the tents?'\n\n'On the old spot, brother.'\n\n'Any news since we parted?'\n\n'Two deaths, brother.'\n\n'Who are dead, Jasper?'\n\n'Father and mother, brother.'\n\n'Where did they die?'\n\n'Where they were sent, brother.'\n\n'And Mrs. Herne?'\n\n'She's alive, brother.'\n\n'Where is she now?'\n\n'In Yorkshire, brother.'\n\n'What is your opinion of death, Mr. Petulengro?' said I, as I sat down\nbeside him.\n\n'My opinion of death, brother, is much the same as that in the old song\nof Pharaoh, which I have heard my grandam sing--\n\n   Cana marel o manus chivios ande puv,\n   Ta rovel pa leste o chavo ta romi.\n\nWhen a man dies, he is cast into the earth, and his wife and child sorrow\nover him.  If he has neither wife nor child, then his father and mother,\nI suppose; and if he is quite alone in the world, why, then, he is cast\ninto the earth, and there is an end of the matter.'\n\n{picture:'There's the wind on the heath, brother; if I could only feel\nthat, I would gladly live for ever.': page171.jpg}\n\n'And do you think that is the end of a man?'\n\n'There's an end of him, brother, more's the pity.'\n\n'Why do you say so?'\n\n'Life is sweet, brother.'\n\n'Do you think so?'\n\n'Think so!--There's night and day, brother, both sweet things; sun, moon,\nand stars, brother, all sweet things; there's likewise a wind on the\nheath.  Life is very sweet, brother; who would wish to die?'\n\n'I would wish to die--'\n\n'You talk like a gorgio--which is the same as talking like a fool--were\nyou a Rommany Chal you would talk wiser.  Wish to die, indeed!--A Rommany\nChal would wish to live for ever!'\n\n'In sickness, Jasper?'\n\n'There's the sun and stars, brother.'\n\n'In blindness, Jasper?'\n\n'There's the wind on the heath, brother; if I could only feel that, I\nwould gladly live for ever.  Dosta, we'll now go to the tents and put on\nthe gloves; and I'll try to make you feel what a sweet thing it is to be\nalive, brother!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\n\nThe flower of the grass--Days of pugilism--The rendezvous--Jews--Bruisers\nof England--Winter, spring--Well-earned bays--The fight--Huge black\ncloud--Frame of adamant--The storm--Dukkeripens--The barouche--The rain-\ngushes.\n\nHow for everything there is a time and a season, and then how does the\nglory of a thing pass from it, even like the flower of the grass.  This\nis a truism, but it is one of those which are continually forcing\nthemselves upon the mind.  Many years have not passed over my head, yet,\nduring those which I can recall to remembrance, how many things have I\nseen flourish, pass away, and become forgotten, except by myself, who, in\nspite of all my endeavours, never can forget anything.  I have known the\ntime when a pugilistic encounter between two noted champions was almost\nconsidered in the light of a national affair; when tens of thousands of\nindividuals, high and low, meditated and brooded upon it, the first thing\nin the morning and the last at night, until the great event was decided.\nBut the time is past, and many people will say, thank God that it is; all\nI have to say is, that the French still live on the other side of the\nwater, and are still casting their eyes hitherward--and that in the days\nof pugilism it was no vain blast to say that one Englishman was a match\nfor two of t'other race; at present it would be a vain boast to say so,\nfor these are not the days of pugilism.\n\nBut those to which the course of my narrative has carried me were the\ndays of pugilism; it was then at its height, and consequently near its\ndecline, for corruption had crept into the ring; and how many things,\nstates and sects among the rest, owe their decline to this cause!  But\nwhat a bold and vigorous aspect pugilism wore at that time! and the great\nbattle was just then coming off: the day had been decided upon, and the\nspot--a convenient distance from the old town; and to the old town were\nnow flocking the bruisers of England, men of tremendous renown.  Let no\none sneer at the bruisers of England--what were the gladiators of Rome,\nor the bull-fighters of Spain, in its palmiest days, compared to\nEngland's bruisers?  Pity that ever corruption should have crept in\namongst them--but of that I wish not to talk; let us still hope that a\nspark of the old religion, of which they were the priests, still lingers\nin the breasts of Englishmen.  There they come, the bruisers, from far\nLondon, or from wherever else they might chance to be at the time, to the\ngreat rendezvous in the old city; some came one way, some another: some\nof tip-top reputation came with peers in their chariots, for glory and\nfame are such fair things that even peers are proud to have those\ninvested therewith by their sides; others came in their own gigs, driving\ntheir own bits of blood, and I heard one say: 'I have driven through at a\nheat the whole hundred and eleven miles, and only stopped to bait twice.'\nOh, the blood-horses of old England! but they, too, have had their\nday--for everything beneath the sun there is a season and a time.  But\nthe greater number come just as they can contrive; on the tops of\ncoaches, for example; and amongst these there are fellows with dark\nsallow faces and sharp shining eyes; and it is these that have planted\nrottenness in the core of pugilism, for they are Jews, and, true to their\nkind, have only base lucre in view.\n\nIt was fierce old Cobbett, I think, who first said that the Jews first\nintroduced bad faith amongst pugilists.  He did not always speak the\ntruth, but at any rate he spoke it when he made that observation.  Strange\npeople the Jews--endowed with every gift but one, and that the highest,\ngenius divine--genius which can alone make of men demigods, and elevate\nthem above earth and what is earthy and grovelling; without which a\nclever nation--and, who more clever than the Jews?--may have Rambams in\nplenty, but never a Fielding nor a Shakespeare.  A Rothschild and a\nMendoza, yes--but never a Kean nor a Belcher.\n\nSo the bruisers of England are come to be present at the grand fight\nspeedily coming off; there they are met in the precincts of the old town,\nnear the field of the chapel, planted with tender saplings at the\nrestoration of sporting Charles, which are now become venerable elms, as\nhigh as many a steeple; there they are met at a fitting rendezvous, where\na retired coachman, with one leg, keeps an hotel and a bowling-green.  I\nthink I now see them upon the bowling-green, the men of renown, amidst\nhundreds of people with no renown at all, who gaze upon them with timid\nwonder.  Fame, after all, is a glorious thing, though it lasts only for a\nday.  There's Cribb, the champion of England, and perhaps the best man in\nEngland; there he is, with his huge massive figure, and face wonderfully\nlike that of a lion.  There is Belcher, the younger, not the mighty one,\nwho is gone to his place, but the Teucer Belcher, the most scientific\npugilist that ever entered a ring, only wanting strength to be, I won't\nsay what.  He appears to walk before me now, as he did that evening, with\nhis white hat, white greatcoat, thin genteel figure, springy step, and\nkeen, determined eye.  Crosses him, what a contrast! grim, savage\nShelton, who has a civil word for nobody, and a hard blow for\nanybody--hard! one blow, given with the proper play of his athletic arm,\nwill unsense a giant.  Yonder individual, who strolls about with his\nhands behind him, supporting his brown coat lappets, under-sized, and who\nlooks anything but what he is, is the king of the light weights, so\ncalled--Randall! the terrible Randall, who has Irish blood in his veins;\nnot the better for that, nor the worse; and not far from him is his last\nantagonist, Ned Turner, who, though beaten by him, still thinks himself\nas good a man, in which he is, perhaps, right, for it was a near thing;\nand 'a better shentleman,' in which he is quite right, for he is a\nWelshman.  But how shall I name them all? they were there by dozens, and\nall tremendous in their way.  There was Bulldog Hudson, and fearless\nScroggins, who beat the conqueror of Sam the Jew.  There was Black\nRichmond--no, he was not there, but I knew him well; he was the most\ndangerous of blacks, even with a broken thigh.  There was Purcell, who\ncould never conquer till all seemed over with him.  There was--what!\nshall I name thee last? ay, why not?  I believe that thou art the last of\nall that strong family still above the sod, where mayst thou long\ncontinue--true piece of English stuff, Tom of Bedford--sharp as Winter,\nkind as Spring.\n\nHail to thee, Tom of Bedford, or by whatever name it may please thee to\nbe called, Spring or Winter.  Hail to thee, six-foot Englishman of the\nbrown eye, worthy to have carried a six-foot bow at Flodden, where\nEngland's yeomen triumphed over Scotland's king, his clans and chivalry.\nHail to thee, last of England's bruisers, after all the many victories\nwhich thou hast achieved--true English victories, unbought by yellow\ngold; need I recount them? nay, nay! they are already well known to\nfame--sufficient to say that Bristol's Bull and Ireland's Champion were\nvanquished by thee, and one mightier still, gold itself, thou didst\novercome; for gold itself strove in vain to deaden the power of thy arm;\nand thus thou didst proceed till men left off challenging thee, the\nunvanquishable, the incorruptible.  'Tis a treat to see thee, Tom of\nBedford, in thy 'public' in Holborn way, whither thou hast retired with\nthy well-earned bays.  'Tis Friday night, and nine by Holborn clock.\nThere sits the yeoman at the end of his long room, surrounded by his\nfriends; glasses are filled, and a song is the cry, and a song is sung\nwell suited to the place; it finds an echo in every heart--fists are\nclenched, arms are waved, and the portraits of the mighty fighting men of\nyore, Broughton, and Slack, and Ben, which adorn the walls, appear to\nsmile grim approbation, whilst many a manly voice joins in the bold\nchorus:\n\n   Here's a health to old honest John Bull,\n   When he's gone we shan't find such another,\n   And with hearts and with glasses brim full,\n   We will drink to old England, his mother.\n\nBut the fight! with respect to the fight, what shall I say?  Little can\nbe said about it--it was soon over; some said that the brave from town,\nwho was reputed the best man of the two, and whose form was a perfect\nmodel of athletic beauty, allowed himself, for lucre vile, to be\nvanquished by the massive champion with the flattened nose.  One thing is\ncertain, that the former was suddenly seen to sink to the earth before a\nblow of by no means extraordinary power.  Time, time! was called; but\nthere he lay upon the ground apparently senseless, and from thence he did\nnot lift his head till several seconds after the umpires had declared his\nadversary victor.\n\nThere were shouts; indeed there's never a lack of shouts to celebrate a\nvictory, however acquired; but there was also much grinding of teeth,\nespecially amongst the fighting men from town.  'Tom has sold us,' said\nthey, 'sold us to the yokels; who would have thought it?'  Then there was\nfresh grinding of teeth, and scowling brows were turned to the heaven;\nbut what is this? is it possible, does the heaven scowl too? why, only a\nquarter of an hour ago . . . but what may not happen in a quarter of an\nhour?  For many weeks the weather had been of the most glorious\ndescription, the eventful day, too, had dawned gloriously, and so it had\ncontinued till some two hours after noon; the fight was then over; and\nabout that time I looked up--what a glorious sky of deep blue, and what a\nbig fierce sun swimming high above in the midst of that blue; not a\ncloud--there had not been one for weeks--not a cloud to be seen, only in\nthe far west, just on the horizon, something like the extremity of a\nblack wing; that was only a quarter of an hour ago, and now the whole\nnorthern side of the heaven is occupied by a huge black cloud, and the\nsun is only occasionally seen amidst masses of driving vapour; what a\nchange! but another fight is at hand, and the pugilists are clearing the\nouter ring;--how their huge whips come crashing upon the heads of the\nyokels; blood flows, more blood than in the fight; those blows are given\nwith right good-will, those are not sham blows, whether of whip or fist;\nit is with fist that grim Shelton strikes down the big yokel; he is\nalways dangerous, grim Shelton, but now particularly so, for he has lost\nten pounds betted on the brave who sold himself to the yokels; but the\nouter ring is cleared: and now the second fight commences; it is between\ntwo champions of less renown than the others, but is perhaps not the\nworse on that account.  A tall thin boy is fighting in the ring with a\nman somewhat under the middle size, with a frame of adamant; that's a\ngallant boy! he's a yokel, but he comes from Brummagem, and he does\ncredit to his extraction; but his adversary has a frame of adamant: in\nwhat a strange light they fight, but who can wonder, on looking at that\nfrightful cloud usurping now one-half of heaven, and at the sun\nstruggling with sulphurous vapour; the face of the boy, which is turned\ntowards me, looks horrible in that light, but he is a brave boy, he\nstrikes his foe on the forehead, and the report of the blow is like the\nsound of a hammer against a rock; but there is a rush and a roar\noverhead, a wild commotion, the tempest is beginning to break loose;\nthere's wind and dust, a crash, rain and hail; is it possible to fight\namidst such a commotion? yes! the fight goes on; again the boy strikes\nthe man full on the brow, but it is of no use striking that man, his\nframe is of adamant.  'Boy, thy strength is beginning to give way, and\nthou art becoming confused'; the man now goes to work, amidst rain and\nhail.  'Boy, thou wilt not hold out ten minutes longer against rain,\nhail, and the blows of such an antagonist.'\n\nAnd now the storm was at its height; the black thunder-cloud had broken\ninto many, which assumed the wildest shapes and the strangest colours,\nsome of them unspeakably glorious; the rain poured in a deluge, and more\nthan one waterspout was seen at no great distance: an immense rabble is\nhurrying in one direction; a multitude of men of all ranks, peers and\nyokels, prize-fighters and Jews, and the last came to plunder, and are\nnow plundering amidst that wild confusion of hail and rain, men and\nhorses, carts and carriages.  But all hurry in one direction, through mud\nand mire; there's a town only three miles distant, which is soon reached,\nand soon filled, it will not contain one-third of that mighty rabble; but\nthere's another town farther on--the good old city is farther on, only\ntwelve miles; what's that! who will stay here? onward to the old town.\n\nHurry-skurry, a mixed multitude of men and horses, carts and carriages,\nall in the direction of the old town; and, in the midst of all that mad\nthrong, at a moment when the rain-gushes were coming down with particular\nfury, and the artillery of the sky was pealing as I had never heard it\npeal before, I felt some one seize me by the arm--I turned round, and\nbeheld Mr. Petulengro.\n\n'I can't hear you, Mr. Petulengro,' said I; for the thunder drowned the\nwords which he appeared to be uttering.\n\n'Dearginni,' I heard Mr. Petulengro say, 'it thundreth.  I was asking,\nbrother, whether you believe in dukkeripens?'\n\n'I do not, Mr. Petulengro; but this is strange weather to be asking me\nwhether I believe in fortunes.'\n\n'Grondinni,' said Mr. Petulengro, 'it haileth.  I believe in dukkeripens,\nbrother.'\n\n'And who has more right,' said I; 'seeing that you live by them?  But\nthis tempest is truly horrible.'\n\n'Dearginni, grondinni ta villaminni!  It thundreth, it haileth, and also\nflameth,' said Mr. Petulengro.  'Look up there, brother!'\n\nI looked up.  Connected with this tempest there was one feature to which\nI have already alluded--the wonderful colours of the clouds.  Some were\nof vivid green; others of the brightest orange; others as black as pitch.\nThe gypsy's finger was pointed to a particular part of the sky.\n\n'What do you see there, brother?'\n\n'A strange kind of cloud.'\n\n'What does it look like, brother?'\n\n'Something like a stream of blood.'\n\n'That cloud foreshoweth a bloody dukkeripen.'\n\n'A bloody fortune!' said I.  'And whom may it betide?'\n\n'Who knows!' said the gypsy.\n\nDown the way, dashing and splashing, and scattering man, horse, and cart\nto the left and right, came an open barouche, drawn by four smoking\nsteeds, with postilions in scarlet jackets and leather skull-caps.  Two\nforms were conspicuous in it; that of the successful bruiser, and of his\nfriend and backer, the sporting gentleman of my acquaintance.\n\n'His!' said the gypsy, pointing to the latter, whose stern features wore\na smile of triumph, as, probably recognising me in the crowd, he nodded\nin the direction of where I stood, as the barouche hurried by.\n\nThere went the barouche, dashing through the rain-gushes, and in it one\nwhose boast it was that he was equal to 'either fortune.'  Many have\nheard of that man--many may be desirous of knowing yet more of him.  I\nhave nothing to do with that man's after life--he fulfilled his\ndukkeripen.  'A bad, violent man!'  Softly, friend; when thou wouldst\nspeak harshly of the dead, remember that thou hast not yet fulfilled thy\nown dukkeripen!\n\n{picture:'That cloud foreshoweth a bloody dukkeripen.': page179.jpg}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\n\nMy father--Premature decay--The easy-chair--A few questions--So you told\nme--A difficult language--They can it Haik--Misused\nopportunities--Saul--Want of candour--Don't weep--Heaven forgive me--Dated\nfrom Paris--I wish he were here--A father's reminiscences--Farewell to\nvanities.\n\nMy father, as I have already informed the reader, had been endowed by\nnature with great corporeal strength; indeed, I have been assured that,\nat the period of his prime, his figure had denoted the possession of\nalmost Herculean powers.  The strongest forms, however, do not always\nendure the longest, the very excess of the noble and generous juices\nwhich they contain being the cause of their premature decay.  But, be\nthat as it may, the health of my father, some few years after his\nretirement from the service to the quiet of domestic life, underwent a\nconsiderable change; his constitution appeared to be breaking up; and he\nwas subject to severe attacks from various disorders, with which, till\nthen, he had been utterly unacquainted.  He was, however, wont to rally,\nmore or less, after his illnesses, and might still occasionally be seen\ntaking his walk, with his cane in his hand, and accompanied by his dog,\nwho sympathised entirely with him, pining as he pined, improving as he\nimproved, and never leaving the house save in his company; and in this\nmanner matters went on for a considerable time, no very great\napprehension with respect to my father's state being raised either in my\nmother's breast or my own.  But, about six months after the period at\nwhich I have arrived in my last chapter, it came to pass that my father\nexperienced a severer attack than on any previous occasion.\n\nHe had the best medical advice; but it was easy to see, from the looks of\nhis doctors, that they entertained but slight hopes of his recovery.  His\nsufferings were great, yet he invariably bore them with unshaken\nfortitude.  There was one thing remarkable connected with his illness;\nnotwithstanding its severity, it never confined him to his bed.  He was\nwont to sit in his little parlour, in his easy-chair, dressed in a faded\nregimental coat, his dog at his feet, who would occasionally lift his\nhead from the hearth-rug on which he lay, and look his master wistfully\nin the face.  And thus my father spent the greater part of his time,\nsometimes in prayer, sometimes in meditation, and sometimes in reading\nthe Scriptures.  I frequently sat with him, though, as I entertained a\ngreat awe for my father, I used to feel rather ill at ease, when, as\nsometimes happened, I found myself alone with him.\n\n'I wish to ask you a few questions,' said he to me one day, after my\nmother had left the room.\n\n'I will answer anything you may please to ask me, my dear father.'\n\n'What have you been about lately?'\n\n'I have been occupied as usual, attending at the office at the appointed\nhours.'\n\n'And what do you there?'\n\n'Whatever I am ordered.'\n\n'And nothing else?'\n\n'Oh yes! sometimes I read a book.'\n\n'Connected with your profession?'\n\n'Not always; I have been lately reading Armenian--'\n\n'What's that?'\n\n'The language of a people whose country is a region on the other side of\nAsia Minor.'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'A region abounding with mountains.'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'Amongst which is Mount Ararat.'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'Upon which, as the Bible informs us, the ark rested.'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'It is the language of the people of those regions--'\n\n'So you told me.'\n\n'And I have been reading the Bible in their language.'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'Or rather, I should say, in the ancient language of these people; from\nwhich I am told the modem Armenian differs considerably.'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'As much as the Italian from the Latin.'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'So I have been reading the Bible in ancient Armenian.'\n\n'You told me so before.'\n\n'I found it a highly difficult language.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Differing widely from the languages in general with which I am\nacquainted.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Exhibiting, however, some features in common with them.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'And sometimes agreeing remarkably in words with a certain strange wild\nspeech with which I became acquainted--'\n\n'Irish?'\n\n'No, father, not Irish--with which I became acquainted by the greatest\nchance in the world.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'But of which I need say nothing farther at present, and which I should\nnot have mentioned but for that fact.'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'Which I consider remarkable.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'The Armenian is copious.'\n\n'Is it?'\n\n'With an alphabet of thirty-nine letters, but it is harsh and guttural.'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Like the language of most mountainous people--the Armenians call it\nHaik.'\n\n'Do they?'\n\n'And themselves, Haik, also; they are a remarkable people, and, though\ntheir original habitation is the Mountain of Ararat, they are to be\nfound, like the Jews, all over the world.'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'Well, father, that's all I can tell you about the Haiks, or Armenians.'\n\n'And what does it all amount to?'\n\n'Very little, father; indeed, there is very little known about the\nArmenians; their early history, in particular, is involved in\nconsiderable mystery.'\n\n'And, if you knew all that it was possible to know about them, to what\nwould it amount? to what earthly purpose could you turn it? have you\nacquired any knowledge of your profession?'\n\n'Very little, father.'\n\n'Very little!  Have you acquired all in your power?'\n\n'I can't say that I have, father.'\n\n'And yet it was your duty to have done so.  But I see how it is, you have\nshamefully misused your opportunities; you are like one who, sent into\nthe field to labour, passes his time in flinging stones at the birds of\nheaven.'\n\n'I would scorn to fling a stone at a bird, father.'\n\n'You know what I mean, and all too well, and this attempt to evade\ndeserved reproof by feigned simplicity is quite in character with your\ngeneral behaviour.  I have ever observed about you a want of frankness,\nwhich has distressed me; you never speak of what you are about, your\nhopes, or your projects, but cover yourself with mystery.  I never knew\ntill the present moment that you were acquainted with Armenian.'\n\n'Because you never asked me, father; there's nothing to conceal in the\nmatter--I will tell you in a moment how I came to learn Armenian.  A lady\nwhom I met at one of Mrs. ---'s parties took a fancy to me, and has done\nme the honour to allow me to go and see her sometimes.  She is the widow\nof a rich clergyman, and on her husband's death came to this place to\nlive, bringing her husband's library with her: I soon found my way to it,\nand examined every book.  Her husband must have been a learned man, for\namongst much Greek and Hebrew I found several volumes in Armenian, or\nrelating to the language.'\n\n'And why did you not tell me of this before?'\n\n'Because you never questioned me; but, I repeat, there is nothing to\nconceal in the matter.  The lady took a fancy to me, and, being fond of\nthe arts, drew my portrait; she said the expression of my countenance put\nher in mind of Alfieri's Saul.'\n\n'And do you still visit her?'\n\n'No, she soon grew tired of me, and told people that she found me very\nstupid; she gave me the Armenian books, however.'\n\n'Saul,' said my father, musingly, 'Saul.  I am afraid she was only too\nright there; he disobeyed the commands of his master, and brought down on\nhis head the vengeance of Heaven--he became a maniac, prophesied, and\nflung weapons about him.'\n\n'He was, indeed, an awful character--I hope I shan't turn out like him.'\n\n'God forbid!' said my father, solemnly; 'but in many respects you are\nheadstrong and disobedient like him.  I placed you in a profession, and\nbesought you to make yourself master of it by giving it your undivided\nattention.  This, however, you did not do, you know nothing of it, but\ntell me that you are acquainted with Armenian; but what I dislike most is\nyour want of candour--you are my son, but I know little of your real\nhistory, you may know fifty things for what I am aware: you may know how\nto shoe a horse for what I am aware.'\n\n'Not only to shoe a horse, father, but to make horse-shoes.'\n\n'Perhaps so,' said my father; 'and it only serves to prove what I was\njust saying, that I know little about you.'\n\n'But you easily may, my dear father; I will tell you anything that you\nmay wish to know--shall I inform you how I learnt to make horse-shoes?'\n\n'No,' said my father; 'as you kept it a secret so long, it may as well\ncontinue so still.  Had you been a frank, open-hearted boy, like one I\ncould name, you would have told me all about it of your own accord.  But\nI now wish to ask you a serious question--what do you propose to do?'\n\n'To do, father?'\n\n'Yes! the time for which you were articled to your profession will soon\nbe expired, and I shall be no more.'\n\n'Do not talk so, my dear father; I have no doubt that you will soon be\nbetter.'\n\n'Do not flatter yourself; I feel that my days are numbered, I am soon\ngoing to my rest, and I have need of rest, for I am weary.  There, there,\ndon't weep!  Tears will help me as little as they will you; you have not\nyet answered my question.  Tell me what you intend to do?'\n\n'I really do not know what I shall do.'\n\n'The military pension which I enjoy will cease with my life.  The\nproperty which I shall leave behind me will be barely sufficient for the\nmaintenance of your mother respectably.  I again ask you what you intend\nto do.  Do you think you can support yourself by your Armenian or your\nother acquirements?'\n\n'Alas!  I think little at all about it; but I suppose I must push into\nthe world, and make a good fight, as becomes the son of him who fought\nBig Ben; if I can't succeed, and am driven to the worst, it is but\ndying--'\n\n'What do you mean by dying?'\n\n'Leaving the world; my loss would scarcely be felt.  I have never held\nlife in much value, and every one has a right to dispose as he thinks\nbest of that which is his own.'\n\n'Ah! now I understand you; and well I know how and where you imbibed that\nhorrible doctrine, and many similar ones which I have heard from your\nmouth; but I wish not to reproach you--I view in your conduct a\npunishment for my own sins, and I bow to the will of God.  Few and evil\nhave been my days upon the earth; little have I done to which I can look\nback with satisfaction.  It is true I have served my king fifty years,\nand I have fought with--Heaven forgive me, what was I about to say!--but\nyou mentioned the man's name, and our minds willingly recall our ancient\nfollies.  Few and evil have been my days upon earth, I may say with Jacob\nof old, though I do not mean to say that my case is so hard as his; he\nhad many undutiful children, whilst I have only ---; but I will not\nreproach you.  I have also like him a son to whom I can look with hope,\nwho may yet preserve my name when I am gone, so let me be thankful;\nperhaps, after all, I have not lived in vain.  Boy, when I am gone, look\nup to your brother, and may God bless you both!  There, don't weep; but\ntake the Bible, and read me something about the old man and his\nchildren.'\n\nMy brother had now been absent for the space of three years.  At first\nhis letters had been frequent, and from them it appeared that he was\nfollowing his profession in London with industry; they then became rather\nrare, and my father did not always communicate their contents.  His last\nletter, however, had filled him and our whole little family with joy; it\nwas dated from Paris, and the writer was evidently in high spirits.  After\ndescribing in eloquent terms the beauties and gaieties of the French\ncapital, he informed us how he had plenty of money, having copied a\ncelebrated picture of one of the Italian masters for a Hungarian\nnobleman, for which he had received a large sum.  'He wishes me to go\nwith him to Italy,' added he, 'but I am fond of independence; and, if\never I visit old Rome, I will have no patrons near me to distract my\nattention.'  But six months had now elapsed from the date of this letter,\nand we had heard no further intelligence of my brother.  My father's\ncomplaint increased; the gout, his principal enemy, occasionally mounted\nhigh up in his system, and we had considerable difficulty in keeping it\nfrom the stomach, where it generally proves fatal.  I now devoted almost\nthe whole of my time to my father, on whom his faithful partner also\nlavished every attention and care.  I read the Bible to him, which was\nhis chief delight; and also occasionally such other books as I thought\nmight prove entertaining to him.  His spirits were generally rather\ndepressed.  The absence of my brother appeared to prey upon his mind.  'I\nwish he were here,' he would frequently exclaim; 'I can't imagine what\ncan have become of him; I trust, however, he will arrive in time.'  He\nstill sometimes rallied, and I took advantage of those moments of\ncomparative ease to question him upon the events of his early life.  My\nattentions to him had not passed unnoticed, and he was kind, fatherly,\nand unreserved.  I had never known my father so entertaining as at these\nmoments, when his life was but too evidently drawing to a close.  I had\nno idea that he knew and had seen so much; my respect for him increased,\nand I looked upon him almost with admiration.  His anecdotes were in\ngeneral highly curious; some of them related to people in the highest\nstations, and to men whose names were closely connected with some of the\nbrightest glories of our native land.  He had frequently conversed--almost\non terms of familiarity--with good old George.  He had known the\nconqueror of Tippoo Saib; and was the friend of Townshend, who, when\nWolfe fell, led the British grenadiers against the shrinking regiments of\nMontcalm.  'Pity,' he added, 'that when old--old as I am now--he should\nhave driven his own son mad by robbing him of his plighted bride; but so\nit was; he married his son's bride.  I saw him lead her to the altar; if\never there was an angelic countenance, it was that girl's; she was almost\ntoo fair to be one of the daughters of women.  Is there anything, boy,\nthat you would wish to ask me? now is the time.'\n\n'Yes, father; there is one about whom I would fain question you.'\n\n'Who is it? shall I tell you about Elliot?'\n\n'No, father, not about Elliot; but pray don't be angry; I should like to\nknow something about Big Ben.'\n\n'You are a strange lad,' said my father; 'and, though of late I have\nbegun to entertain a more favourable opinion than heretofore, there is\nstill much about you that I do not understand.  Why do you bring up that\nname?  Don't you know that it is one of my temptations: you wish to know\nsomething about him.  Well!  I will oblige you this once, and then\nfarewell to such vanities--something about him.  I will tell you--his--skin\nwhen he flung off his clothes--and he had a particular knack in doing\nso--his skin, when he bared his mighty chest and back for combat; and\nwhen he fought he stood, so . . . . if I remember right--his skin, I say,\nwas brown and dusky as that of a toad.  Oh me!  I wish my elder son was\nhere.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\n\nMy brother's arrival--The interview--Night--A dying father--Christ.\n\nAt last my brother arrived; he looked pale and unwell; I met him at the\ndoor.  'You have been long absent,' said I.\n\n'Yes,' said he, 'perhaps too long; but how is my father?'\n\n'Very poorly,' said I, 'he has had a fresh attack; but where have you\nbeen of late?'\n\n'Far and wide,' said my brother; 'but I can't tell you anything now, I\nmust go to my father.  It was only by chance that I heard of his\nillness.'\n\n'Stay a moment,' said I.  'Is the world such a fine place as you supposed\nit to be before you went away?'\n\n'Not quite,' said my brother, 'not quite; indeed I wish--but ask me no\nquestions now, I must hasten to my father.'  There was another question\non my tongue, but I forbore; for the eyes of the young man were full of\ntears.  I pointed with my finger, and the young man hastened past me to\nthe arms of his father.\n\nI forbore to ask my brother whether he had been to old Rome.\n\nWhat passed between my father and brother I do not know; the interview,\nno doubt, was tender enough, for they tenderly loved each other; but my\nbrother's arrival did not produce the beneficial effect upon my father\nwhich I at first hoped it would; it did not even appear to have raised\nhis spirits.  He was composed enough, however: 'I ought to be grateful,'\nsaid he; 'I wished to see my son, and God has granted me my wish; what\nmore have I to do now than to bless my little family and go?'\n\nMy father's end was evidently at hand.\n\nAnd did I shed no tears? did I breathe no sighs? did I never wring my\nhands at this period? the reader will perhaps be asking.  Whatever I did\nand thought is best known to God and myself; but it will be as well to\nobserve, that it is possible to feel deeply, and yet make no outward\nsign.\n\nAnd now for the closing scene.\n\nAt the dead hour of night, it might be about two, I was awakened from\nsleep by a cry which sounded from the room immediately below that in\nwhich I slept.  I knew the cry, it was the cry of my mother; and I also\nknew its import, yet I made no effort to rise, for I was for the moment\nparalysed.  Again the cry sounded, yet still I lay motionless--the\nstupidity of horror was upon me.  A third time, and it was then that, by\na violent effort, bursting the spell which appeared to bind me, I sprang\nfrom the bed and rushed downstairs.  My mother was running wildly about\nthe room; she had awoke, and found my father senseless in the bed by her\nside.  I essayed to raise him, and after a few efforts supported him in\nthe bed in a sitting posture.  My brother now rushed in, and, snatching\nup a light that was burning, he held it to my father's face.  'The\nsurgeon, the surgeon!' he cried; then, dropping the light, he ran out of\nthe room followed by my mother; I remained alone, supporting the\nsenseless form of my father; the light had been extinguished by the fall,\nand an almost total darkness reigned in the room.  The form pressed\nheavily against my bosom--at last methought it moved.  Yes, I was right,\nthere was a heaving of the breast, and then a gasping.  Were those words\nwhich I heard?  Yes, they were words, low and indistinct at first, and\nthen audible.  The mind of the dying man was reverting to former scenes.\nI heard him mention names which I had often heard him mention before.  It\nwas an awful moment; I felt stupefied, but I still contrived to support\nmy dying father.  There was a pause, again my father spoke: I heard him\nspeak of Minden, and of Meredith, the old Minden sergeant, and then he\nuttered another name, which at one period of his life was much in his\nlips, the name of . . . but this is a solemn moment!  There was a deep\ngasp: I shook, and thought all was over; but I was mistaken--my father\nmoved, and revived for a moment; he supported himself in bed without my\nassistance.  I make no doubt that for a moment he was perfectly sensible,\nand it was then that, clasping his hands, he uttered another name\nclearly, distinctly--it was the name of Christ.  With that name upon his\nlips, the brave old soldier sank back upon my bosom, and, with his hands\nstill clasped, yielded up his soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\n\nThe greeting--Queer figure--Cheer up--The cheerful fire--It will do--The\nsally forth--Trepidation--Let him come in.\n\n'One-and-ninepence, sir, or the things which you have brought with you\nwill be taken away from you!'\n\nSuch were the first words which greeted my ears, one damp misty morning\nin March, as I dismounted from the top of a coach in the yard of a London\ninn.\n\nI turned round, for I felt that the words were addressed to myself.\nPlenty of people were in the yard--porters, passengers, coachmen,\nhostlers, and others, who appeared to be intent on anything but myself,\nwith the exception of one individual, whose business appeared to lie with\nme, and who now confronted me at the distance of about two yards.\n\nI looked hard at the man--and a queer kind of individual he was to look\nat--a rakish figure, about thirty, and of the middle size, dressed in a\ncoat smartly cut, but threadbare, very tight pantaloons of blue stuff,\ntied at the ankles, dirty white stockings and thin shoes, like those of a\ndancing-master; his features were not ugly, but rather haggard, and he\nappeared to owe his complexion less to nature than carmine; in fact, in\nevery respect, a very queer figure.\n\n'One-and-ninepence, sir, or your things will be taken away from you!' he\nsaid, in a kind of lisping tone, coming yet nearer to me.\n\nI still remained staring fixedly at him, but never a word answered.  Our\neyes met; whereupon he suddenly lost the easy impudent air which he\nbefore wore.  He glanced, for a moment, at my fist, which I had by this\ntime clenched, and his features became yet more haggard; he faltered; a\nfresh 'one-and-ninepence,' which he was about to utter, died on his lips;\nhe shrank back, disappeared behind a coach, and I saw no more of him.\n\n'One-and-ninepence, or my things will be taken away from me!' said I to\nmyself, musingly, as I followed the porter to whom I had delivered my\nscanty baggage; 'am I to expect many of these greetings in the big world?\nWell, never mind!  I think I know the counter-sign!'  And I clenched my\nfist yet harder than before.\n\nSo I followed the porter, through the streets of London, to a lodging\nwhich had been prepared for me by an acquaintance.  The morning, as I\nhave before said, was gloomy, and the streets through which I passed were\ndank and filthy; the people, also, looked dank and filthy; and so,\nprobably, did I, for the night had been rainy, and I had come upwards of\na hundred miles on the top of a coach; my heart had sunk within me, by\nthe time we reached a dark narrow street, in which was the lodging.\n\n'Cheer up, young man,' said the porter, 'we shall have a fine afternoon!'\n\nAnd presently I found myself in the lodging which had been prepared for\nme.  It consisted of a small room, up two pair of stairs, in which I was\nto sit, and another still smaller above it, in which I was to sleep.  I\nremember that I sat down, and looked disconsolate about me--everything\nseemed so cold and dingy.  Yet how little is required to make a\nsituation--however cheerless at first sight--cheerful and comfortable.\nThe people of the house, who looked kindly upon me, lighted a fire in the\ndingy grate; and, then, what a change!--the dingy room seemed dingy no\nmore!  Oh the luxury of a cheerful fire after a chill night's journey!  I\ndrew near to the blazing grate, rubbed my hands, and felt glad.\n\nAnd, when I had warmed myself, I turned to the table, on which, by this\ntime, the people of the house had placed my breakfast; and I ate and I\ndrank; and, as I ate and drank, I mused within myself, and my eyes were\nfrequently directed to a small green box, which constituted part of my\nluggage, and which, with the rest of my things, stood in one corner of\nthe room, till at last, leaving my breakfast unfinished, I rose, and,\ngoing to the box, unlocked it, and took out two or three bundles of\npapers tied with red tape, and, placing them on the table, I resumed my\nseat and my breakfast, my eyes intently fixed upon the bundles of papers\nall the time.\n\nAnd when I had drained the last cup of tea out of a dingy teapot, and ate\nthe last slice of the dingy loaf, I untied one of the bundles, and\nproceeded to look over the papers, which were closely written over in a\nsingular hand, and I read for some time, till at last I said to myself,\n'It will do.'  And then I looked at the other bundle for some time\nwithout untying it; and at last I said, 'It will do also.'  And then I\nturned to the fire, and, putting my feet against the sides of the grate,\nI leaned back on my chair, and, with my eyes upon the fire, fell into\ndeep thought.\n\nAnd there I continued in thought before the fire, until my eyes closed,\nand I fell asleep; which was not to be wondered at, after the fatigue and\ncold which I had lately undergone on the coach-top; and, in my sleep, I\nimagined myself still there, amidst darkness and rain, hurrying now over\nwild heaths, and now along roads overhung with thick and umbrageous\ntrees, and sometimes methought I heard the horn of the guard, and\nsometimes the voice of the coachman, now chiding, now encouraging his\nhorses, as they toiled through the deep and miry ways.  At length a\ntremendous crack of a whip saluted the tympanum of my ear, and I started\nup broad awake, nearly oversetting the chair on which I reclined--and lo!\nI was in the dingy room before the fire, which was by this time half\nextinguished.  In my dream I had confounded the noise of the street with\nthose of my night journey; the crack which had aroused me I soon found\nproceeded from the whip of a carter, who, with many oaths, was flogging\nhis team below the window.\n\nLooking at a clock which stood upon the mantelpiece, I perceived that it\nwas past eleven; whereupon I said to myself, 'I am wasting my time\nfoolishly and unprofitably, forgetting that I am now in the big world,\nwithout anything to depend upon save my own exertions'; and then I\nadjusted my dress, and, locking up the bundle of papers which I had not\nread, I tied up the other, and, taking it under my arm, I went\ndownstairs; and, after asking a question or two of the people of the\nhouse, I sallied forth into the street with a determined look, though at\nheart I felt somewhat timorous at the idea of venturing out alone into\nthe mazes of the mighty city, of which I had heard much, but of which, of\nmy own knowledge, I knew nothing.\n\n{picture:I sprang up the steps, and gave a loud rap: page192.jpg}\n\nI had, however, no great cause for anxiety in the present instance; I\neasily found my way to the place which I was in quest of--one of the many\nnew squares on the northern side of the metropolis, and which was\nscarcely ten minutes' walk from the street in which I had taken up my\nabode.  Arriving before the door of a tolerably large house which bore a\ncertain number, I stood still for a moment in a kind of trepidation,\nlooking anxiously at the door; I then slowly passed on till I came to the\nend of the square, where I stood still, and pondered for a while.\nSuddenly, however, like one who has formed a resolution, I clenched my\nright hand, flinging my hat somewhat on one side, and, turning back with\nhaste to the door before which I had stopped, I sprang up the steps, and\ngave a loud rap, ringing at the same time the bell of the area.  After\nthe lapse of a minute the door was opened by a maid-servant of no very\ncleanly or prepossessing appearance, of whom I demanded, in a tone of\nsome hauteur, whether the master of the house was at home.  Glancing for\na moment at the white paper bundle beneath my arm, the handmaid made no\nreply in words, but, with a kind of toss of her head, flung the door\nopen, standing on one side as if to let me enter.  I did enter; and the\nhand-maid, having opened another door on the right hand, went in, and\nsaid something which I could not hear: after a considerable pause,\nhowever, I heard the voice of a man say, 'Let him come in'; whereupon the\nhandmaid, coming out, motioned me to enter, and, on my obeying, instantly\nclosed the door behind me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\n\nThe sinister glance--Excellent correspondent--Quite original--My system--A\nlosing trade--Merit--Starting a Review--What have you\ngot?--Stop!--_Dairyman's Daughter_--Oxford principles--More\nconversation--How is this?\n\nThere were two individuals in the room in which I now found myself; it\nwas a small study, surrounded with bookcases, the window looking out upon\nthe square.  Of these individuals he who appeared to be the principal\nstood with his back to the fireplace.  He was a tall stout man, about\nsixty, dressed in a loose morning gown.  The expression of his\ncountenance would have been bluff but for a certain sinister glance, and\nhis complexion might have been called rubicund but for a considerable\ntinge of bilious yellow.  He eyed me askance as I entered.  The other, a\npale, shrivelled-looking person, sat at a table apparently engaged with\nan account-book; he took no manner of notice of me, never once lifting\nhis eyes from the page before him.\n\n'Well, sir, what is your pleasure?' said the big man, in a rough tone, as\nI stood there, looking at him wistfully--as well I might--for upon that\nman, at the time of which I am speaking, my principal, I may say my only,\nhopes rested.\n\n'Sir,' said I, 'my name is so-and-so, and I am the bearer of a letter to\nyou from Mr. so-and-so, an old friend and correspondent of yours.'\n\nThe countenance of the big man instantly lost the suspicious and lowering\nexpression which it had hitherto exhibited; he strode forward, and,\nseizing me by the hand, gave me a violent squeeze.\n\n'My dear sir,' said he, 'I am rejoiced to see you in London.  I have been\nlong anxious for the pleasure--we are old friends, though we have never\nbefore met.  Taggart,' said he to the man who sat at the desk, 'this is\nour excellent correspondent, the friend and pupil of our other excellent\ncorrespondent.'\n\nThe pale, shrivelled-looking man slowly and deliberately raised his head\nfrom the account-book, and surveyed me for a moment or two; not the\nslightest emotion was observable in his countenance.  It appeared to me,\nhowever, that I could detect a droll twinkle in his eye: his curiosity,\nif he had any, was soon gratified; he made me a kind of bow, pulled out a\nsnuff-box, took a pinch of snuff, and again bent his head over the page.\n\n'And now, my dear sir,' said the big man, 'pray sit down, and tell me the\ncause of your visit.  I hope you intend to remain here a day or two.'\n\n'More than that,' said I, 'I am come to take up my abode in London.'\n\n'Glad to hear it; and what have you been about of late? got anything\nwhich will suit me?  Sir, I admire your style of writing, and your manner\nof thinking; and I am much obliged to my good friend and correspondent\nfor sending me some of your productions.  I inserted them all, and wished\nthere had been more of them--quite original, sir, quite: took with the\npublic, especially the essay about the non-existence of anything.  I\ndon't exactly agree with you though; I have my own peculiar ideas about\nmatter--as you know, of course, from the book I have published.\nNevertheless, a very pretty piece of speculative philosophy--no such\nthing as matter--impossible that there should be--_ex nihilo_--what is\nthe Greek?  I have forgot--very pretty indeed; very original.'\n\n'I am afraid, sir, it was very wrong to write such trash, and yet more to\nallow it to be published.'\n\n'Trash! not at all; a very pretty piece of speculative philosophy; of\ncourse you were wrong in saying there is no world.  The world must exist,\nto have the shape of a pear; and that the world is shaped like a pear,\nand not like an apple, as the fools of Oxford say, I have satisfactorily\nproved in my book.  Now, if there were no world, what would become of my\nsystem?  But what do you propose to do in London?'\n\n'Here is the letter, sir,' said I, 'of our good friend, which I have not\nyet given to you; I believe it will explain to you the circumstances\nunder which I come.'\n\nHe took the letter, and perused it with attention.  'Hem!' said he, with\na somewhat altered manner, 'my friend tells me that you are come up to\nLondon with the view of turning your literary talents to account, and\ndesires me to assist you in my capacity of publisher in bringing forth\ntwo or three works which you have prepared.  My good friend is perhaps\nnot aware that for some time past I have given up publishing--was obliged\nto do so--had many severe losses--do nothing at present in that line,\nsave sending out the Magazine once a month; and, between ourselves, am\nthinking of disposing of that--wish to retire--high time at my age--so\nyou see--'\n\n'I am very sorry, sir, to hear that you cannot assist me' (and I remember\nthat I felt very nervous); 'I had hoped--'\n\n'A losing trade, I assure you, sir; literature is a drug.  Taggart, what\no'clock is?'\n\n'Well, sir!' said I, rising, 'as you cannot assist me, I will now take my\nleave; I thank you sincerely for your kind reception, and will trouble\nyou no longer.'\n\n'Oh, don't go.  I wish to have some further conversation with you; and\nperhaps I may hit upon some plan to benefit you.  I honour merit, and\nalways make a point to encourage it when I can; but--Taggart, go to the\nbank, and tell them to dishonour the bill twelve months after date for\nthirty pounds which becomes due to-morrow.  I am dissatisfied with that\nfellow who wrote the fairy tales, and intend to give him all the trouble\nin my power.  Make haste.'\n\nTaggart did not appear to be in any particular haste.  First of all, he\ntook a pinch of snuff, then, rising from his chair, slowly and\ndeliberately drew his wig, for he wore a wig of a brown colour, rather\nmore over his forehead than it had previously been, buttoned his coat,\nand, taking his hat, and an umbrella which stood in a corner, made me a\nlow bow, and quitted the room.\n\n'Well, sir, where were we?  Oh, I remember, we were talking about merit.\nSir, I always wish to encourage merit, especially when it comes so highly\nrecommended as in the present instance.  Sir, my good friend and\ncorrespondent speaks of you in the highest terms.  Sir, I honour my good\nfriend, and have the highest respect for his opinion in all matters\nconnected with literature--rather eccentric though.  Sir, my good friend\nhas done my periodical more good and more harm than all the rest of my\ncorrespondents.  Sir, I shall never forget the sensation caused by the\nappearance of his article about a certain personage whom he proved--and I\nthink satisfactorily--to have been a legionary soldier--rather startling,\nwas it not?  The S--- of the world a common soldier, in a marching\nregiment--original, but startling; sir, I honour my good friend.'\n\n'So you have renounced publishing, sir,' said I, 'with the exception of\nthe Magazine?'\n\n'Why, yes; except now and then, under the rose; the old coachman, you\nknow, likes to hear the whip.  Indeed, at the present moment, I am\nthinking of starting a Review on an entirely new and original principle;\nand it just struck me that you might be of high utility in the\nundertaking--what do you think of the matter?'\n\n'I should be happy, sir, to render you any assistance, but I am afraid\nthe employment you propose requires other qualifications than I possess;\nhowever, I can make the essay.  My chief intention in coming to London\nwas to lay before the world what I had prepared; and I had hoped by your\nassistance--'\n\n'Ah!  I see, ambition!  Ambition is a very pretty thing; but, sir, we\nmust walk before we run, according to the old saying--what is that you\nhave got under your arm?'\n\n'One of the works to which I was alluding; the one, indeed, which I am\nmost anxious to lay before the world, as I hope to derive from it both\nprofit and reputation.'\n\n'Indeed! what do you call it?'\n\n'Ancient songs of Denmark, heroic and romantic, translated by myself;\nwith notes philological, critical, and historical.'\n\n'Then, sir, I assure you that your time and labour have been entirely\nflung away; nobody would read your ballads, if you were to give them to\nthe world to-morrow.'\n\n'I am sure, sir, that you would say otherwise if you would permit me to\nread one to you'; and, without waiting for the answer of the big man, nor\nindeed so much as looking at him, to see whether he was inclined or not\nto hear me, I undid my manuscript, and, with a voice trembling with\neagerness, I read to the following effect:--\n\n   Buckshank bold and Elfinstone,\n   And more than I can mention here,\n   They caused to be built so stout a ship,\n   And unto Iceland they would steer.\n\n   They launched the ship upon the main,\n   Which bellowed like a wrathful bear;\n   Down to the bottom the vessel sank,\n   A laidly Trold has dragged it there.\n\n   Down to the bottom sank young Roland,\n   And round about he groped awhile;\n   Until he found the path which led\n   Unto the bower of Ellenlyle.\n\n'Stop!' said the publisher; 'very pretty indeed, and very original; beats\nScott hollow, and Percy too: but, sir, the day for these things is gone\nby; nobody at present cares for Percy, nor for Scott either, save as a\nnovelist; sorry to discourage merit, sir, but what can I do!  What else\nhave you got?'\n\n'The songs of Ab Gwilym, the Welsh bard, also translated by myself, with\nnotes critical, philological, and historical.'\n\n'Pass on--what else?'\n\n'Nothing else,' said I, folding up my manuscript with a sigh, 'unless it\nbe a romance in the German style; on which, I confess, I set very little\nvalue.'\n\n'Wild?'\n\n'Yes, sir, very wild.'\n\n'Like the Miller of the Black Valley?'\n\n'Yes, sir, very much like the Miller of the Black Valley.'\n\n'Well, that's better,' said the publisher; 'and yet, I don't know, I\nquestion whether any one at present cares for the miller himself.  No,\nsir, the time for those things is also gone by; German, at present, is a\ndrug; and, between ourselves, nobody has contributed to make it so more\nthan my good friend and correspondent;--but, sir, I see you are a young\ngentleman of infinite merit, and I always wish to encourage merit.  Don't\nyou think you could write a series of evangelical tales?'\n\n'Evangelical tales, sir?'\n\n'Yes, sir, evangelical novels.'\n\n'Something in the style of Herder?'\n\n'Herder is a drug, sir; nobody cares for Herder--thanks to my good\nfriend.  Sir, I have in yon drawer a hundred pages about Herder, which I\ndare not insert in my periodical; it would sink it, sir.  No, sir,\nsomething in the style of the _Dairyman's Daughter_.'\n\n'I never heard of the work till the present moment.'\n\n'Then, sir, procure it by all means.  Sir, I could afford as much as ten\npounds for a well-written tale in the style of the _Dairyman's Daughter_;\nthat is the kind of literature, sir, that sells at the present day!  It\nis not the Miller of the Black Valley--no, sir, nor Herder either, that\nwill suit the present taste; the evangelical body is becoming very\nstrong, sir; the canting scoundrels--'\n\n'But, sir, surely you would not pander to a scoundrelly taste?'\n\n'Then, sir, I must give up business altogether.  Sir, I have a great\nrespect for the goddess Reason--an infinite respect, sir; indeed, in my\ntime, I have made a great many sacrifices for her; but, sir, I cannot\naltogether ruin myself for the goddess Reason.  Sir, I am a friend to\nLiberty, as is well known; but I must also be a friend to my own family.\nIt is with the view of providing for a son of mine that I am about to\nstart the Review of which I was speaking.  He has taken into his head to\nmarry, sir, and I must do something for him, for he can do but little for\nhimself.  Well, sir, I am a friend to Liberty, as I said before, and\nlikewise a friend to Reason; but I tell you frankly that the Review which\nI intend to get up under the rose, and present him with when it is\nestablished, will be conducted on Oxford principles.'\n\n'Orthodox principles, I suppose you mean, sir?'\n\n'I do, sir; I am no linguist, but I believe the words are synonymous.'\n\nMuch more conversation passed between us, and it was agreed that I should\nbecome a contributor to the Oxford Review.  I stipulated, however, that,\nas I knew little of politics, and cared less, no other articles should be\nrequired from me than such as were connected with belles-lettres and\nphilology; to this the big man readily assented.  'Nothing will be\nrequired from you,' said he, 'but what you mention; and now and then,\nperhaps, a paper on metaphysics.  You understand German, and perhaps it\nwould be desirable that you should review Kant; and in a review of Kant,\nsir, you could introduce to advantage your peculiar notions about _ex\nnihilo_.'  He then reverted to the subject of the _Dairyman's Daughter_,\nwhich I promised to take into consideration.  As I was going away, he\ninvited me to dine with him on the ensuing Sunday.\n\n'That's a strange man!' said I to myself, after I had left the house; 'he\nis evidently very clever; but I cannot say that I like him much, with his\nOxford Reviews and Dairyman's Daughters.  But what can I do?  I am almost\nwithout a friend in the world.  I wish I could find some one who would\npublish my ballads, or my songs of Ab Gwilym.  In spite of what the big\nman says, I am convinced that, once published, they would bring me much\nfame and profit.  But how is this?--what a beautiful sun!--the porter was\nright in saying that the day would clear up--I will now go to my dingy\nlodging, lock up my manuscripts, and then take a stroll about the big\ncity.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\n\nThe walk--London's Cheape--Street of the Lombards--Strange bridge--Main\narch--The roaring gulf--The boat--Cly-faking--A comfort--The book--The\nblessed woman--No trap.\n\nSo I set out on my walk to see the wonders of the big city, and, as\nchance would have it, I directed my course to the east.  The day, as I\nhave already said, had become very fine, so that I saw the great city to\nadvantage, and the wonders thereof: and much I admired all I saw; and,\namongst other things, the huge cathedral, standing so proudly on the most\ncommanding ground in the big city; and I looked up to the mighty dome,\nsurmounted by a golden cross, and I said within myself, 'That dome must\nneeds be the finest in the world'; and I gazed upon it till my eyes\nreeled, and my brain became dizzy, and I thought that the dome would fall\nand crush me; and I shrank within myself, and struck yet deeper into the\nheart of the big city.\n\n'O Cheapside! Cheapside!' said I, as I advanced up that mighty\nthoroughfare, 'truly thou art a wonderful place for hurry, noise, and\nriches!  Men talk of the bazaars of the East--I have never seen them--but\nI daresay that, compared with thee, they are poor places, silent places,\nabounding with empty boxes, O thou pride of London's east!--mighty mart\nof old renown!--for thou art not a place of yesterday:--long before the\nRoses red and white battled in fair England, thou didst exist--a place of\nthrong and bustle--place of gold and silver, perfumes and fine linen.\nCenturies ago thou couldst extort the praises even of the fiercest foes\nof England.  Fierce bards of Wales, sworn foes of England, sang thy\npraises centuries ago; and even the fiercest of them all, Red Julius\nhimself, wild Glendower's bard, had a word of praise for London's\n'Cheape,' for so the bards of Wales styled thee in their flowing odes.\nThen, if those who were not English, and hated England, and all connected\ntherewith, had yet much to say in thy praise, when thou wast far inferior\nto what thou art now, why should true-born Englishmen, or those who call\nthemselves so, turn up their noses at thee, and scoff thee at the present\nday, as I believe they do?  But, let others do as they will, I, at least,\nwho am not only an Englishman, but an East Englishman, will not turn up\nmy nose at thee, but will praise and extol thee, calling thee mart of the\nworld--a place of wonder and astonishment!--and, were it right and\nfitting to wish that anything should endure for ever, I would say\nprosperity to Cheapside, throughout all ages--may it be the world's\nresort for merchandise, world without end.\n\nAnd when I had passed through the Cheape I entered another street, which\nled up a kind of ascent, and which proved to be the street of the\nLombards, called so from the name of its first founders; and I walked\nrapidly up the street of the Lombards, neither looking to the right nor\nleft, for it had no interest for me, though I had a kind of consciousness\nthat mighty things were being transacted behind its walls: but it wanted\nthe throng, bustle, and outward magnificence of the Cheape, and it had\nnever been spoken of by 'ruddy bards'!  And, when I had got to the end of\nthe street of the Lombards, I stood still for some time, deliberating\nwithin myself whether I should turn to the right or the left, or go\nstraight forward, and at last I turned to the right, down a street of\nrapid descent, and presently found myself upon a bridge which traversed\nthe river which runs by the big city.\n\nA strange kind of bridge it was; huge and massive, and seemingly of great\nantiquity.  It had an arched back, like that of a hog, a high balustrade,\nand at either side, at intervals, were stone bowers bulking over the\nriver, but open on the other side, and furnished with a semicircular\nbench.  Though the bridge was wide--very wide--it was all too narrow for\nthe concourse upon it.  Thousands of human beings were pouring over the\nbridge.  But what chiefly struck my attention was a double row of carts\nand wagons, the generality drawn by horses as large as elephants, each\nrow striving hard in a different direction, and not unfrequently brought\nto a stand-still.  Oh the cracking of whips, the shouts and oaths of the\ncarters, and the grating of wheels upon the enormous stones that formed\nthe pavement!  In fact, there was a wild burly-burly upon the bridge,\nwhich nearly deafened me.  But, if upon the bridge there was a confusion,\nbelow it there was a confusion ten times confounded.  The tide, which was\nfast ebbing, obstructed by the immense piers of the old bridge, poured\nbeneath the arches with a fall of several feet, forming in the river\nbelow as many whirlpools as there were arches.  Truly tremendous was the\nroar of the descending waters, and the bellow of the tremendous gulfs,\nwhich swallowed them for a time, and then cast them forth, foaming and\nfrothing from their horrid wombs.  Slowly advancing along the bridge, I\ncame to the highest point, and there I stood still, close beside one of\nthe stone bowers, in which, beside a fruit-stall, sat an old woman, with\na pan of charcoal at her feet, and a book in her hand, in which she\nappeared to be reading intently.  There I stood, just above the principal\narch, looking through the balustrade at the scene that presented\nitself--and such a scene!  Towards the left bank of the river, a forest\nof masts, thick and close, as far as the eye could reach; spacious\nwharfs, surmounted with gigantic edifices; and, far away, Caesar's\nCastle, with its White Tower.  To the right, another forest of masts, and\na maze of buildings, from which, here and there, shot up to the sky\nchimneys taller than Cleopatra's Needle, vomiting forth huge wreaths of\nthat black smoke which forms the canopy--occasionally a gorgeous one--of\nthe more than Babel city.  Stretching before me, the troubled breast of\nthe mighty river, and, immediately below, the main whirlpool of the\nThames--the Maelstrom of the bulwarks of the middle arch--a grisly pool,\nwhich, with its superabundance of horror, fascinated me.  Who knows but I\nshould have leapt into its depths?--I have heard of such things--but for\na rather startling occurrence which broke the spell.  As I stood upon the\nbridge, gazing into the jaws of the pool, a small boat shot suddenly\nthrough the arch beneath my feet.  There were three persons in it; an\noarsman in the middle, whilst a man and woman sat at the stern.  I shall\nnever forget the thrill of horror which went through me at this sudden\napparition.  What!--a boat--a small boat--passing beneath that arch into\nyonder roaring gulf!  Yes, yes, down through that awful water-way, with\nmore than the swiftness of an arrow, shot the boat, or skiff, right into\nthe jaws of the pool.  A monstrous breaker curls over the prow--there is\nno hope; the boat is swamped, and all drowned in that strangling vortex.\nNo! the boat, which appeared to have the buoyancy of a feather, skipped\nover the threatening horror, and, the next moment, was out of danger, the\nboatman--a true boatman of Cockaigne that--elevating one of his sculls in\nsign of triumph, the man hallooing, and the woman, a true Englishwoman\nthat--of a certain class--waving her shawl.  Whether any one observed\nthem save myself, or whether the feat was a common one, I know not; but\nnobody appeared to take any notice of them.  As for myself, I was so\nexcited that I strove to clamber up the balustrade of the bridge, in\norder to obtain a better view of the daring adventurers.  Before I could\naccomplish my design, however, I felt myself seized by the body, and,\nturning my head, perceived the old fruit-woman, who was clinging to me.\n\n{picture:Beside a fruit-stall sat an old woman, with a pan of charcoal at\nher feet, and a book in her hand: page203.jpg}\n\n'Nay, dear! don't--don't!' said she.  'Don't fling yourself over--perhaps\nyou may have better luck next time!'\n\n'I was not going to fling myself over,' said I, dropping from the\nbalustrade; 'how came you to think of such a thing?'\n\n'Why, seeing you clamber up so fiercely, I thought you might have had ill\nluck, and that you wished to make away with yourself.'\n\n'Ill luck,' said I, going into the stone bower, and sitting down.  'What\ndo you mean? ill luck in what?'\n\n'Why, no great harm, dear! cly-faking perhaps.'\n\n'Are you coming over me with dialects,' said I, 'speaking unto me in\nfashions I wot nothing of?'\n\n'Nay, dear! don't look so strange with those eyes of your'n, nor talk so\nstrangely; I don't understand you.'\n\n'Nor I you; what do you mean by cly-faking?'\n\n'Lor, dear! no harm; only taking a handkerchief now and then.'\n\n'Do you take me for a thief?\n\n'Nay, dear! don't make use of bad language; we never calls them thieves\nhere, but prigs and fakers: to tell you the truth, dear, seeing you\nspring at that railing put me in mind of my own dear son, who is now at\nBot'ny: when he had bad luck, he always used to talk of flinging himself\nover the bridge; and, sure enough, when the traps were after him, he did\nfling himself into the river, but that was off the bank; nevertheless,\nthe traps pulled him out, and he is now suffering his sentence; so you\nsee you may speak out, if you have done anything in the harmless line,\nfor I am my son's own mother, I assure you.'\n\n'So you think there's no harm in stealing?'\n\n'No harm in the world, dear!  Do you think my own child would have been\ntransported for it, if there had been any harm in it? and, what's more,\nwould the blessed woman in the book here have written her life as she has\ndone, and given it to the world, if there had been any harm in faking?\nShe, too, was what they call a thief and a cut-purse; ay, and was\ntransported for it, like my dear son; and do you think she would have\ntold the world so, if there had been any harm in the thing?  Oh, it is a\ncomfort to me that the blessed woman was transported, and came back--for\ncome back she did, and rich too--for it is an assurance to me that my\ndear son, who was transported too, will come back like her.'\n\n'What was her name?'\n\n'Her name, blessed Mary Flanders.'\n\n'Will you let me look at the book?'\n\n'Yes, dear, that I will, if you promise me not to run away with it.'\n\nI took the book from her hand; a short thick volume, at least a century\nold, bound with greasy black leather.  I turned the yellow and\ndog's-eared pages, reading here and there a sentence.  Yes, and no\nmistake!  _His_ pen, his style, his spirit might be observed in every\nline of the uncouth-looking old volume--the air, the style, the spirit of\nthe writer of the book which first taught me to read.  I covered my face\nwith my hand, and thought of my childhood. . . .\n\n'This is a singular book,' said I at last; 'but it does not appear to\nhave been written to prove that thieving is no harm, but rather to show\nthe terrible consequences of crime: it contains a deep moral.'\n\n'A deep what, dear?'\n\n'A--but no matter, I will give you a crown for this volume.'\n\n'No, dear, I will not sell the volume for a crown.'\n\n'I am poor,' said I; 'but I will give you two silver crowns for your\nvolume.'\n\n'No, dear, I will not sell my volume for two silver crowns; no, nor for\nthe golden one in the king's tower down there; without my book I should\nmope and pine, and perhaps fling myself into the river; but I am glad you\nlike it, which shows that I was right about you, after all; you are one\nof our party, and you have a flash about that eye of yours which puts me\njust in mind of my dear son.  No, dear, I won't sell you my book; but, if\nyou like, you may have a peep into it whenever you come this way.  I\nshall be glad to see you; you are one of the right sort, for, if you had\nbeen a common one, you would have run away with the thing; but you scorn\nsuch behaviour, and, as you are so flash of your money, though you say\nyou are poor, you may give me a tanner to buy a little baccy with; I love\nbaccy, dear, more by token that it comes from the plantations to which\nthe blessed woman was sent.'\n\n'What's a tanner?' said I.\n\n'Lor! don't you know, dear?  Why, a tanner is sixpence; and, as you were\ntalking just now about crowns, it will be as well to tell you that those\nof our trade never calls them crowns, but bulls; but I am talking\nnonsense, just as if you did not know all that already, as well as\nmyself; you are only shamming--I'm no trap, dear, nor more was the\nblessed woman in the book.  Thank you, dear--thank you for the tanner; if\nI don't spend it, I'll keep it in remembrance of your sweet face.  What,\nyou are going?--well, first let me whisper a word to you.  If you have\nany clies to sell at any time, I'll buy them of you; all safe with me; I\nnever peach, and scores a trap; so now, dear, God bless you! and give you\ngood luck.  Thank you for your pleasant company, and thank you for the\ntanner.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\n\nThe tanner--The hotel--Drinking claret--London journal--New\nfield--Commonplaceness--The three individuals--Botheration--Frank and\nardent.\n\n'Tanner!' said I musingly, as I left the bridge; 'Tanner! what can the\nman who cures raw skins by means of a preparation of oak bark and other\nmaterials have to do with the name which these fakers, as they call\nthemselves, bestow on the smallest silver coin in these dominions?\nTanner!  I can't trace the connection between the man of bark and the\nsilver coin, unless journeymen tanners are in the habit of working for\nsixpence a day.  But I have it,' I continued, flourishing my hat over my\nhead, 'tanner, in this instance, is not an English word.'  Is it not\nsurprising that the language of Mr. Petulengro and of Tawno Chikno is\ncontinually coming to my assistance whenever I appear to be at a nonplus\nwith respect to the derivation of crabbed words?  I have made out crabbed\nwords in AEschylus by means of the speech of Chikno and Petulengro, and\neven in my Biblical researches I have derived no slight assistance from\nit.  It appears to be a kind of picklock, an open sesame, Tanner--Tawno!\nthe one is but a modification of the other; they were originally\nidentical, and have still much the same signification.  Tanner, in the\nlanguage of the apple-woman, meaneth the smallest of English silver\ncoins; and Tawno, in the language of the Petulengres, though bestowed\nupon the biggest of the Romans, according to strict interpretation\nsignifieth a little child.\n\nSo I left the bridge, retracing my steps for a considerable way, as I\nthought I had seen enough in the direction in which I had hitherto been\nwandering; I should say that I scarcely walked less than thirty miles\nabout the big city on the day of my first arrival.  Night came on, but\nstill I was walking about, my eyes wide open, and admiring everything\nthat presented itself to them.  Everything was new to me, for everything\nis different in London from what it is elsewhere--the people, their\nlanguage, the horses, the _tout ensemble_--even the stones of London are\ndifferent from others--at least it appeared to me that I had never walked\nwith the same case and facility on the flagstones of a country town as on\nthose of London; so I continued roving about till night came on, and then\nthe splendour of some of the shops particularly struck me.  'A regular\nArabian Nights entertainment!' said I, as I looked into one on Cornhill,\ngorgeous with precious merchandise, and lighted up with lustres, the rays\nof which were reflected from a hundred mirrors.\n\nBut, notwithstanding the excellence of the London pavement, I began about\nnine o'clock to feel myself thoroughly tired; painfully and slowly did I\ndrag my feet along.  I also felt very much in want of some refreshment,\nand I remembered that since breakfast I had taken nothing.  I was now in\nthe Strand, and, glancing about, I perceived that I was close by an\nhotel, which bore over the door the somewhat remarkable name of Holy\nLands.  Without a moment's hesitation I entered a well-lighted passage,\nand, turning to the left, I found myself in a well-lighted coffee-room,\nwith a well-dressed and frizzled waiter before me, 'Bring me some\nclaret,' said I, for I was rather faint than hungry, and I felt ashamed\nto give a humbler order to so well-dressed an individual.  The waiter\nlooked at me for a moment; then, making a low bow, he bustled off, and I\nsat myself down in the box nearest to the window.  Presently the waiter\nreturned, bearing beneath his left arm a long bottle, and between the\nfingers of his right hand two large purple glasses; placing the latter on\nthe table, he produced a corkscrew, drew the cork in a twinkling, set the\nbottle down before me with a bang, and then, standing still, appeared to\nwatch my movements.  You think I don't know how to drink a glass of\nclaret, thought I to myself.  I'll soon show you how we drink claret\nwhere I come from; and, filling one of the glasses to the brim, I\nflickered it for a moment between my eyes and the lustre, and then held\nit to my nose; having given that organ full time to test the bouquet of\nthe wine, I applied the glass to my lips, taking a large mouthful of the\nwine, which I swallowed slowly and by degrees, that the palate might\nlikewise have an opportunity of performing its functions.  A second\nmouthful I disposed of more summarily; then, placing the empty glass upon\nthe table, I fixed my eyes upon the bottle, and said--nothing; whereupon\nthe waiter, who had been observing the whole process with considerable\nattention, made me a bow yet more low than before, and, turning on his\nheel, retired with a smart chuck of his head, as much as to say, It is\nall right: the young man is used to claret.\n\n{picture:The young man is used to claret: page209.jpg}\n\nAnd when the waiter had retired I took a second glass of the wine, which\nI found excellent; and, observing a newspaper lying near me, I took it up\nand began perusing it.  It has been observed somewhere that people who\nare in the habit of reading newspapers every day are not unfrequently\nstruck with the excellence of style and general talent which they\ndisplay.  Now, if that be the case, how must I have been surprised, who\nwas reading a newspaper for the first time, and that one of the best of\nthe London journals!  Yes, strange as it may seem, it was nevertheless\ntrue that, up to the moment of which I am speaking, I had never read a\nnewspaper of any description.  I of course had frequently seen journals,\nand even handled them; but, as for reading them, what were they to me?  I\ncared not for news.  But here I was now with my claret before me,\nperusing, perhaps, the best of all the London journals; it was not the ---\n, and I was astonished: an entirely new field of literature appeared to\nbe opened to my view.  It was a discovery, but I confess rather an\nunpleasant one; for I said to myself, If literary talent is so very\ncommon in London, that the journals, things which, as their very name\ndenotes, are ephemeral, are written in a style like the article I have\nbeen perusing, how can I hope to distinguish myself in this big town,\nwhen, for the life of me, I don't think I could write anything half so\nclever as what I have been reading?  And then I laid down the paper, and\nfell into deep musing; rousing myself from which, I took a glass of wine,\nand, pouring out another, began musing again.  What I have been reading,\nthought I, is certainly very clever and very talented; but talent and\ncleverness I think I have heard some one say are very commonplace things,\nonly fitted for everyday occasions.  I question whether the man who wrote\nthe book I saw this day on the bridge was a clever man; but, after all,\nwas he not something much better? I don't think he could have written\nthis article, but then he wrote the book which I saw on the bridge.  Then,\nif he could not have written the article on which I now hold my\nforefinger--and I do not believe he could--why should I feel discouraged\nat the consciousness that I, too, could not write it?  I certainly could\nno more have written the article than he could; but then, like him,\nthough I would not compare myself to the man who wrote the book I saw\nupon the bridge, I think I could--and here I emptied the glass of\nclaret--write something better.\n\nThereupon I resumed the newspaper; and, as I was before struck with the\nfluency of style and the general talent which it displayed, I was now\nequally so with its commonplaceness and want of originality on every\nsubject; and it was evident to me that, whatever advantage these\nnewspaper-writers might have over me in some points, they had never\nstudied the Welsh bards, translated Kaempe Viser, or been under the\npupilage of Mr. Petulengro and Tawno Chikno.\n\nAnd as I sat conning the newspaper three individuals entered the room,\nand seated themselves in the box at the farther end of which I was.  They\nwere all three very well dressed; two of them elderly gentlemen, the\nthird a young man about my own age, or perhaps a year or two older: they\ncalled for coffee; and, after two or three observations, the two eldest\ncommenced a conversation in French, which, however, though they spoke it\nfluently enough, I perceived at once was not their native language; the\nyoung man, however, took no part in their conversation, and when they\naddressed a portion to him, which indeed was but rarely, merely replied\nby a monosyllable.  I have never been a listener, and I paid but little\nheed to their discourse, nor indeed to themselves; as I occasionally\nlooked up, however, I could perceive that the features of the young man,\nwho chanced to be seated exactly opposite to me, wore an air of\nconstraint and vexation.  This circumstance caused me to observe him more\nparticularly than I otherwise should have done: his features were\nhandsome and prepossessing; he had dark brown hair and a high-arched\nforehead.  After the lapse of half an hour, the two elder individuals,\nhaving finished their coffee, called for the waiter, and then rose as if\nto depart, the young man, however, still remaining seated in the box.  The\nothers, having reached the door, turned round, and, finding that the\nyouth did not follow them, one of them called to him with a tone of some\nauthority; whereupon the young man rose, and, pronouncing half audibly\nthe word 'botheration,' rose and followed them.  I now observed that he\nwas remarkably tall.  All three left the house.  In about ten minutes,\nfinding nothing more worth reading in the newspaper, I laid it down, and\nthough the claret was not yet exhausted, I was thinking of betaking\nmyself to my lodgings, and was about to call the waiter, when I heard a\nstep in the passage, and in another moment the tall young man entered the\nroom, advanced to the same box, and, sitting down nearly opposite to me,\nagain pronounced to himself, but more audibly than before, the same word.\n\n'A troublesome world this, sir,' said I, looking at him.\n\n'Yes,' said the young man, looking fixedly at me; 'but I am afraid we\nbring most of our troubles on our own heads--at least I can say so of\nmyself,' he added, laughing.  Then, after a pause, 'I beg pardon,' he\nsaid, 'but am I not addressing one of my own country?'\n\n'Of what country are you?' said I.\n\n'Ireland.'\n\n'I am not of your country, sir; but I have an infinite veneration for\nyour country, as Strap said to the French soldier.  Will you take a glass\nof wine?'\n\n'Ah, de tout mon coeur, as the parasite said to Gil Blas,' cried the\nyoung man, laughing.  'Here's to our better acquaintance!'\n\nAnd better acquainted we soon became; and I found that, in making the\nacquaintance of the young man, I had indeed made a valuable acquisition;\nhe was accomplished, highly connected, and bore the name of Francis\nArdry.  Frank and ardent he was, and in a very little time had told me\nmuch that related to himself, and in return I communicated a general\noutline of my own history; he listened with profound attention, but\nlaughed heartily when I told him some particulars of my visit in the\nmorning to the publisher, whom he had frequently heard of.\n\nWe left the house together.\n\n'We shall soon see each other again,' said he, as we separated at the\ndoor of my lodging.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\n\nDine with the publisher--Religions--No animal food--Unprofitable\ndiscussions--Principles of criticism--The book market--Newgate\nlives--Goethe a drug--German acquirements--Moral dignity.\n\nOn the Sunday I was punctual to my appointment to dine with the\npublisher.  As I hurried along the square in which his house stood, my\nthoughts were fixed so intently on the great man, that I passed by him\nwithout seeing him.  He had observed me, however, and joined me just as I\nwas about to knock at the door.  'Let us take a turn in the square,' said\nhe, 'we shall not dine for half an hour.'\n\n'Well,' said he, as we were walking in the square, 'what have you been\ndoing since I last saw you?'\n\n'I have been looking about London,' said I, 'and I have bought the\n_Dairyman's Daughter_; here it is.'\n\n'Pray put it up,' said the publisher; 'I don't want to look at such\ntrash.  Well, do you think you could write anything like it?'\n\n'I do not,' said I.\n\n'How is that?' said the publisher, looking at me.\n\n'Because,' said I, 'the man who wrote it seems to be perfectly well\nacquainted with his subject; and, moreover, to write from the heart.'\n\n'By the subject you mean--'\n\n'Religion.'\n\n'And ain't you acquainted with religion?'\n\n'Very little.'\n\n'I am sorry for that,' said the publisher seriously, 'for he who sets up\nfor an author ought to be acquainted not only with religion, but\nreligions, and indeed with all subjects, like my good friend in the\ncountry.  It is well that I have changed my mind about the _Dairyman's\nDaughter_, or I really don't know whom I could apply to on the subject at\nthe present moment, unless to himself; and after all I question whether\nhis style is exactly suited for an evangelical novel.'\n\n'Then you do not wish for an imitation of the _Dairyman's Daughter_?'\n\n'I do not, sir; I have changed my mind, as I told you before; I wish to\nemploy you in another line, but will communicate to you my intentions\nafter dinner.'\n\nAt dinner, beside the publisher and myself, were present his wife and son\nwith his newly-married bride; the wife appeared a quiet respectable\nwoman, and the young people looked very happy and good-natured; not so\nthe publisher, who occasionally eyed both with contempt and dislike.\nConnected with this dinner there was one thing remarkable; the publisher\ntook no animal food, but contented himself with feeding voraciously on\nrice and vegetables prepared in various ways.\n\n'You eat no animal food, sir?' said I.\n\n'I do not, sir,' said he; 'I have forsworn it upwards of twenty years.  In\none respect, sir, I am a Brahmin.  I abhor taking away life--the brutes\nhave as much right to live as ourselves.'\n\n'But,' said I, 'if the brutes were not killed, there would be such a\nsuperabundance of them, that the land would be overrun with them.'\n\n'I do not think so, sir; few are killed in India, and yet there is plenty\nof room.'\n\n'But,' said I, 'Nature intended that they should be destroyed, and the\nbrutes themselves prey upon one another, and it is well for themselves\nand the world that they do so.  What would be the state of things if\nevery insect, bird, and worm were left to perish of old age?'\n\n'We will change the subject,' said the publisher; 'I have never been a\nfriend of unprofitable discussions.'\n\nI looked at the publisher with some surprise, I had not been accustomed\nto be spoken to so magisterially; his countenance was dressed in a\nportentous frown, and his eye looked more sinister than ever; at that\nmoment he put me in mind of some of those despots of whom I had read in\nthe history of Morocco, whose word was law.  He merely wants power,\nthought I to myself, to be a regular Muley Mehemet; and then I sighed,\nfor I remembered how very much I was in the power of that man.\n\nThe dinner over, the publisher nodded to his wife, who departed, followed\nby her daughter-in-law.  The son looked as if he would willingly have\nattended them; he, however, remained seated; and, a small decanter of\nwine being placed on the table, the publisher filled two glasses, one of\nwhich he handed to myself, and the other to his son; saying, 'Suppose you\ntwo drink to the success of the Review.  I would join you,' said he,\naddressing himself to me, 'but I drink no wine; if I am a Brahmin with\nrespect to meat, I am a Mahometan with respect to wine.'\n\nSo the son and I drank success to the Review, and then the young man\nasked me various questions; for example--How I liked London?--Whether I\ndid not think it a very fine place?--Whether I was at the play the night\nbefore?--and whether I was in the park that afternoon?  He seemed\npreparing to ask me some more questions; but, receiving a furious look\nfrom his father, he became silent, filled himself a glass of wine, drank\nit off, looked at the table for about a minute, then got up, pushed back\nhis chair, made me a bow, and left the room.\n\n'Is that young gentleman, sir,' said I, 'well versed in the principles of\ncriticism?'\n\n'He is not, sir,' said the publisher; 'and, if I place him at the head of\nthe Review ostensibly, I do it merely in the hope of procuring him a\nmaintenance; of the principle of a thing he knows nothing, except that\nthe principle of bread is wheat, and that the principle of that wine is\ngrape.  Will you take another glass?'\n\nI looked at the decanter; but, not feeling altogether so sure as the\npublisher's son with respect to the principle of what it contained, I\ndeclined taking any more.\n\n'No, sir,' said the publisher, adjusting himself in his chair, 'he knows\nnothing about criticism, and will have nothing more to do with the\nreviewals than carrying about the books to those who have to review them;\nthe real conductor of the Review will be a widely different person, to\nwhom I will, when convenient, introduce you.  And now we will talk of the\nmatter which we touched upon before dinner: I told you then that I had\nchanged my mind with respect to you; I have been considering the state of\nthe market, sir, the book market, and I have come to the conclusion that,\nthough you might be profitably employed upon evangelical novels, you\ncould earn more money for me, sir, and consequently for yourself, by a\ncompilation of Newgate lives and trials.'\n\n'Newgate lives and trials!'\n\n'Yes, sir,' said the publisher, 'Newgate lives and trials; and now, sir,\nI will briefly state to you the services which I expect you to perform,\nand the terms which I am willing to grant.  I expect you, sir, to compile\nsix volumes of Newgate lives and trials, each volume to contain by no\nmanner of means less than one thousand pages; the remuneration which you\nwill receive when the work is completed will be fifty pounds, which is\nlikewise intended to cover any expenses you may incur in procuring books,\npapers, and manuscripts necessary for the compilation.  Such will be one\nof your employments, sir,--such the terms.  In the second place, you will\nbe expected to make yourself useful in the Review--generally useful,\nsir--doing whatever is required of you; for it is not customary, at least\nwith me, to permit writers, especially young writers, to choose their\nsubjects.  In these two departments, sir, namely compilation and\nreviewing, I had yesterday, after due consideration, determined upon\nemploying you.  I had intended to employ you no farther, sir--at least\nfor the present; but, sir, this morning I received a letter from my\nvalued friend in the country, in which he speaks in terms of strong\nadmiration (I don't overstate) of your German acquirements.  Sir, he says\nthat it would be a thousand pities if your knowledge of the German\nlanguage should be lost to the world, or even permitted to sleep, and he\nentreats me to think of some plan by which it may be turned to account.\nSir, I am at all times willing, if possible, to oblige my worthy friend,\nand likewise to encourage merit and talent; I have, therefore, determined\nto employ you in German.'\n\n'Sir,' said I, rubbing my hands, 'you are very kind, and so is our mutual\nfriend; I shall be happy to make myself useful in German; and if you\nthink a good translation from Goethe--his _Sorrows_ for example, or more\nparticularly his _Faust_--'\n\n'Sir,' said the publisher, 'Goethe is a drug; his _Sorrows_ are a drug,\nso is his _Faustus_, more especially the last, since that fool--rendered\nhim into English.  No, sir, I do not want you to translate Goethe or\nanything belonging to him; nor do I want you to translate anything from\nthe German; what I want you to do, is to translate into German.  I am\nwilling to encourage merit, sir; and, as my good friend in his last\nletter has spoken very highly of your German acquirements, I have\ndetermined that you shall translate my book of philosophy into German.'\n\n'Your book of philosophy into German, sir?'\n\n'Yes, sir; my book of philosophy into German.  I am not a drug, sir, in\nGermany as Goethe is here, no more is my book.  I intend to print the\ntranslation at Leipzig, sir; and if it turns out a profitable\nspeculation, as I make no doubt it will, provided the translation be well\nexecuted, I will make you some remuneration.  Sir, your remuneration will\nbe determined by the success of your translation.'\n\n'But, sir--'\n\n'Sir,' said the publisher, interrupting me, 'you have heard my\nintentions; I consider that you ought to feel yourself highly gratified\nby my intentions towards you; it is not frequently that I deal with a\nwriter, especially a young writer, as I have done with you.  And now,\nsir, permit me to inform you that I wish to be alone.  This is Sunday\nafternoon, sir; I never go to church, but I am in the habit of spending\npart of every Sunday afternoon alone--profitably I hope, sir--in musing\non the magnificence of nature and the moral dignity of man.'\n\n{picture:'I am in the habit of spending part of every Sunday afternoon\nalone, in musing on the magnificence of nature and the moral dignity of\nman.': page217.jpg}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\nThe two volumes--A young author--Intended editor--Quintilian--Loose\nmoney.\n\n'What can't be cured must be endured,' and 'it is hard to kick against\nthe pricks.'\n\nAt the period to which I have brought my history, I bethought me of the\nproverbs with which I have headed this chapter, and determined to act up\nto their spirit.  I determined not to fly in the face of the publisher,\nand to bear--what I could not cure--his arrogance and vanity.  At\npresent, at the conclusion of nearly a quarter of a century, I am glad\nthat I came to that determination, which I did my best to carry into\neffect.\n\nTwo or three days after our last interview, the publisher made his\nappearance in my apartment; he bore two tattered volumes under his arm,\nwhich he placed on the table.  'I have brought you two volumes of lives,\nsir,' said he, 'which I yesterday found in my garret; you will find them\nof service for your compilation.  As I always wish to behave liberally\nand encourage talent, especially youthful talent, I shall make no charge\nfor them, though I should be justified in so doing, as you are aware\nthat, by our agreement, you are to provide any books and materials which\nmay be necessary.  Have you been in quest of any?'\n\n'No,' said I, 'not yet.'\n\n'Then, sir, I would advise you to lose no time in doing so; you must\nvisit all the bookstalls, sir, especially those in the by-streets and\nblind alleys.  It is in such places that you will find the description of\nliterature you are in want of.  You must be up and doing, sir; it will\nnot do for an author, especially a young author, to be idle in this town.\nTo-night you will receive my book of philosophy, and likewise books for\nthe Review.  And, by the bye, sir, it will be as well for you to review\nmy book of philosophy for the Review; the other reviews not having\nnoticed it.  Sir, before translating it, I wish you to review my book of\nphilosophy for the Review.'\n\n'I shall be happy to do my best, sir.'\n\n'Very good, sir; I should be unreasonable to expect anything beyond a\nperson's best.  And now, sir, if you please, I will conduct you to the\nfuture editor of the Review.  As you are to co-operate, sir, I deem it\nright to make you acquainted.'\n\nThe intended editor was a little old man, who sat in a kind of wooden\npavilion in a small garden behind a house in one of the purlieus of the\ncity, composing tunes upon a piano.  The walls of the pavilion were\ncovered with fiddles of various sizes and appearances, and a considerable\nportion of the floor occupied by a pile of books all of one size.  The\npublisher introduced him to me as a gentleman scarcely less eminent in\nliterature than in music, and me to him as an aspirant critic--a young\ngentleman scarcely less eminent in philosophy than in philology.  The\nconversation consisted entirely of compliments till just before we\nseparated, when the future editor inquired of me whether I had ever read\nQuintilian; and, on my replying in the negative, expressed his surprise\nthat any gentleman should aspire to become a critic who had never read\nQuintilian, with the comfortable information, however, that he could\nsupply me with a Quintilian at half-price, that is, a translation made by\nhimself some years previously, of which he had, pointing to the heap on\nthe floor, still a few copies remaining unsold.  For some reason or\nother, perhaps a poor one, I did not purchase the editor's translation of\nQuintilian.\n\n'Sir,' said the publisher, as we were returning from our visit to the\neditor, 'you did right in not purchasing a drug.  I am not prepared, sir,\nto say that Quintilian is a drug, never having seen him; but I am\nprepared to say that man's translation is a drug, judging from the heap\nof rubbish on the floor; besides, sir, you will want any loose money you\nmay have to purchase the description of literature which is required for\nyour compilation.'\n\nThe publisher presently paused before the entrance of a very\nforlorn-looking street.  'Sir,' said he, after looking down it with\nattention, 'I should not wonder if in that street you find works\nconnected with the description of literature which is required for your\ncompilation.  It is in streets of this description, sir, and blind\nalleys, where such works are to be found.  You had better search that\nstreet, sir, whilst I continue my way.'\n\nI searched the street to which the publisher had pointed, and, in the\ncourse of the three succeeding days, many others of a similar kind.  I\ndid not find the description of literature alluded to by the publisher to\nbe a drug, but, on the contrary, both scarce and dear.  I had expended\nmuch more than my loose money long before I could procure materials even\nfor the first volume of my compilation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\n\nFrancis Ardry--Certain sharpers--Brave and eloquent--Opposites--Flinging\nthe bones--Strange places--Dog-fighting--Learning and letters--Batch of\ndogs--Redoubled application.\n\nOne evening I was visited by the tall young gentleman, Francis Ardry,\nwhose acquaintance I had formed at the coffee-house.  As it is necessary\nthat the reader should know something more about this young man, who will\nfrequently appear in the course of these pages, I will state in a few\nwords who and what he was.  He was born of an ancient Roman Catholic\nfamily in Ireland; his parents, whose only child he was, had long been\ndead.  His father, who had survived his mother several years, had been a\nspendthrift, and at his death had left the family property considerably\nembarrassed.  Happily, however, the son and the estate fell into the\nhands of careful guardians, near relations of the family, by whom the\nproperty was managed to the best advantage, and every means taken to\neducate the young man in a manner suitable to his expectations.  At the\nage of sixteen he was taken from a celebrated school in England at which\nhe had been placed, and sent to a small French university, in order that\nhe might form an intimate and accurate acquaintance with the grand\nlanguage of the continent.  There he continued three years, at the end of\nwhich he went under the care of a French abbe to Germany and Italy.  It\nwas in this latter country that he first began to cause his guardians\nserious uneasiness.  He was in the heyday of youth when he visited Italy,\nand he entered wildly into the various delights of that fascinating\nregion, and, what was worse, falling into the hands of certain sharpers,\nnot Italian, but English, he was fleeced of considerable sums of money.\nThe abbe, who, it seems, was an excellent individual of the old French\nschool, remonstrated with his pupil on his dissipation and extravagance;\nbut, finding his remonstrances vain, very properly informed the guardians\nof the manner of life of his charge.  They were not slow in commanding\nFrancis Ardry home; and, as he was entirely in their power, he was forced\nto comply.  He had been about three months in London when I met him in\nthe coffee-room, and the two elderly gentlemen in his company were his\nguardians.  At this time they were very solicitous that he should choose\nfor himself a profession, offering to his choice either the army or\nlaw--he was calculated to shine in either of these professions--for, like\nmany others of his countrymen, he was brave and eloquent; but he did not\nwish to shackle himself with a profession.  As, however, his minority did\nnot terminate till he was three-and-twenty, of which age he wanted nearly\ntwo years, during which he would be entirely dependent on his guardians,\nhe deemed it expedient to conceal, to a certain degree, his sentiments,\ntemporising with the old gentlemen, with whom, notwithstanding his many\nirregularities, he was a great favourite, and at whose death he expected\nto come into a yet greater property than that which he inherited from his\nparents.\n\nSuch is a brief account of Francis Ardry--of my friend Francis Ardry; for\nthe acquaintance, commenced in the singular manner with which the reader\nis acquainted, speedily ripened into a friendship which endured through\nmany long years of separation, and which still endures certainly on my\npart, and on his--if he lives; but it is many years since I have heard\nfrom Francis Ardry.\n\nAnd yet many people would have thought it impossible for our friendship\nto have lasted a week--for in many respects no two people could be more\ndissimilar.  He was an Irishman--I, an Englishman;--he, fiery,\nenthusiastic, and open-hearted; I, neither fiery, enthusiastic, nor open-\nhearted;--he, fond of pleasure and dissipation; I, of study and\nreflection.  Yet it is of such dissimilar elements that the most lasting\nfriendships are formed: we do not like counterparts of ourselves.  'Two\ngreat talkers will not travel far together,' is a Spanish saying; I will\nadd, 'Nor two silent people'; we naturally love our opposites.\n\nSo Francis Ardry came to see me, and right glad I was to see him, for I\nhad just flung my books and papers aside, and was wishing for a little\nsocial converse; and when we had conversed for some little time together,\nFrancis Ardry proposed that we should go to the play to see Kean; so we\nwent to the play, and saw--not Kean, who at that time was ashamed to show\nhimself, but--a man who was not ashamed to show himself, and who people\nsaid was a much better man than Kean--as I have no doubt he was--though\nwhether he was a better actor I cannot say, for I never saw Kean.\n\nTwo or three evenings after Francis Ardry came to see me again, and again\nwe went out together, and Francis Ardry took me to--shall I say?--why\nnot?--a gaming-house, where I saw people playing, and where I saw Francis\nArdry play and lose five guineas, and where I lost nothing, because I did\nnot play, though I felt somewhat inclined; for a man with a white hat and\na sparkling eye held up a box which contained something which rattled,\nand asked me to fling the bones.  'There is nothing like flinging the\nbones!' said he, and then I thought I should like to know what kind of\nthing flinging the bones was; I, however, restrained myself.  'There is\nnothing like flinging the bones!' shouted the man, as my friend and\nmyself left the room.\n\nLong life and prosperity to Francis Ardry! but for him I should not have\nobtained knowledge which I did of the strange and eccentric places of\nLondon.  Some of the places to which he took me were very strange places\nindeed; but, however strange the places were, I observed that the\ninhabitants thought there were no places like their several places, and\nno occupations like their several occupations; and among other strange\nplaces to which Francis Ardry conducted me was a place not far from the\nabbey church of Westminster.\n\n{picture:'There is nothing like flinging the bones!': page223.jpg}\n\nBefore we entered this place our ears were greeted by a confused hubbub\nof human voices, squealing of rats, barking of dogs, and the cries of\nvarious other animals.  Here we beheld a kind of cock-pit, around which a\ngreat many people, seeming of all ranks, but chiefly of the lower, were\ngathered, and in it we saw a dog destroy a great many rats in a very\nsmall period; and when the dog had destroyed the rats, we saw a fight\nbetween a dog and a bear, then a fight between two dogs, then . . . .\n\nAfter the diversions of the day were over, my friend introduced me to the\ngenius of the place, a small man of about five feet high, with a very\nsharp countenance, and dressed in a brown jockey coat and top boots.\n'Joey,' said he, 'this is a friend of mine.'  Joey nodded to me with a\npatronising air.  'Glad to see you, sir!--want a dog?'\n\n'No,' said I.\n\n'You have got one, then--want to match him?'\n\n'We have a dog at home,' said I, 'in the country; but I can't say I\nshould like to match him.  Indeed, I do not like dog-fighting.'\n\n'Not like dog-fighting!' said the man, staring.\n\n'The truth is, Joe, that he is just come to town.'\n\n'So I should think; he looks rather green--not like dog-fighting!'\n\n'Nothing like it, is there, Joey?'\n\n'I should think not; what is like it?  A time will come, and that\nspeedily, when folks will give up everything else, and follow\ndog-fighting.'\n\n'Do you think so?' said I.\n\n'Think so?  Let me ask what there is that a man wouldn't give up for it?'\n\n'Why,' said I, modestly, 'there's religion.'\n\n'Religion!  How you talk.  Why, there's myself bred and born an\nIndependent, and intended to be a preacher, didn't I give up religion for\ndog-fighting?  Religion, indeed!  If it were not for the rascally law, my\npit would fill better on Sundays than any other time.  Who would go to\nchurch when they could come to my pit?  Religion! why, the parsons\nthemselves come to my pit; and I have now a letter in my pocket from one\nof them, asking me to send him a dog.'\n\n'Well, then, politics,' said I.\n\n'Politics!  Why, the gemmen in the House would leave Pitt himself, if he\nwere alive, to come to my pit.  There were three of the best of them here\nto-night, all great horators.--Get on with you, what comes next?'\n\n'Why, there's learning and letters.'\n\n'Pretty things, truly, to keep people from dog-fighting.  Why, there's\nthe young gentlemen from the Abbey School comes here in shoals, leaving\nbooks, and letters, and masters too.  To tell you the truth, I rather\nwish they would mind their letters, for a more precious set of young\nblackguards I never seed.  It was only the other day I was thinking of\ncalling in a constable for my own protection, for I thought my pit would\nhave been torn down by them.'\n\nScarcely knowing what to say, I made an observation at random.  'You\nshow, by your own conduct,' said I, 'that there are other things worth\nfollowing besides dog-fighting.  You practise rat-catching and badger-\nbaiting as well.'\n\nThe dog-fancier eyed me with supreme contempt.\n\n'Your friend here,' said he, 'might well call you a new one.  When I\ntalks of dog-fighting, I of course means rat-catching, and\nbadger-baiting, ay, and bull-baiting too, just as when I speaks\nreligiously, when I says one I means not one but three.  And talking of\nreligion puts me in mind that I have something else to do besides\nchaffing here, having a batch of dogs to send off by this night's packet\nto the Pope of Rome.'\n\nBut at last I had seen enough of what London had to show, whether strange\nor commonplace, so at least I thought, and I ceased to accompany my\nfriend in his rambles about town, and to partake of his adventures.  Our\nfriendship, however, still continued unabated, though I saw, in\nconsequence, less of him.  I reflected that time was passing on--that the\nlittle money I had brought to town was fast consuming, and that I had\nnothing to depend upon but my own exertions for a fresh supply; and I\nreturned with redoubled application to my pursuits.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\nOccupations--Traduttore traditore--Ode to the Mist--Apple and\npear--Reviewing--Current literature--Oxford-like manner--A plain\nstory--Ill-regulated mind--Unsnuffed candle--Strange dreams.\n\nI compiled the Chronicles of Newgate; I reviewed books for the Review\nestablished on an entirely new principle; and I occasionally tried my\nbest to translate into German portions of the publisher's philosophy.  In\nthis last task I experienced more than one difficulty.  I was a tolerable\nGerman scholar, it is true, and I had long been able to translate from\nGerman into English with considerable facility; but to translate from a\nforeign language into your own is a widely different thing from\ntranslating from your own into a foreign language; and, in my first\nattempt to render the publisher into German, I was conscious of making\nmiserable failures, from pure ignorance of German grammar; however, by\nthe assistance of grammars and dictionaries, and by extreme perseverance,\nI at length overcame all the difficulties connected with the German\nlanguage.  But, alas! another difficulty remained, far greater than any\nconnected with German--a difficulty connected with the language of the\npublisher--the language which the great man employed in his writings was\nvery hard to understand; I say in his writings--for his colloquial\nEnglish was plain enough.  Though not professing to be a scholar, he was\nmuch addicted, when writing, to the use of Greek and Latin terms, not as\nother people used them, but in a manner of his own, which set the\nauthority of dictionaries at defiance; the consequence was that I was\nsometimes utterly at a loss to understand the meaning of the publisher.\nMany a quarter of an hour did I pass at this period, staring at periods\nof the publisher, and wondering what he could mean, but in vain, till at\nlast, with a shake of the head, I would snatch up the pen, and render the\npublisher literally into German.  Sometimes I was almost tempted to\nsubstitute something of my own for what the publisher had written, but my\nconscience interposed; the awful words, Traduttore traditore, commenced\nringing in my ears, and I asked myself whether I should be acting\nhonourably towards the publisher, who had committed to me the delicate\ntask of translating him into German; should I be acting honourably\ntowards him, in making him speak in German in a manner different from\nthat in which he expressed himself in English?  No, I could not reconcile\nsuch conduct with any principle of honour; by substituting something of\nmy own in lieu of these mysterious passages of the publisher, I might be\ngiving a fatal blow to his whole system of philosophy.  Besides, when\ntranslating into English, had I treated foreign authors in this manner?\nHad I treated the minstrels of the Kaempe Viser in this manner?--No.  Had\nI treated Ab Gwilym in this manner?  Even when translating his Ode to the\nMist, in which he is misty enough, had I attempted to make Ab Gwilym less\nmisty?  No; on referring to my translation, I found that Ab Gwilym in my\nhands was quite as misty as in his own.  Then, seeing that I had not\nventured to take liberties with people who had never put themselves into\nmy hands for the purpose of being rendered, how could I venture to\nsubstitute my own thoughts and ideas for the publisher's, who had put\nhimself into my hands for that purpose?  Forbid it every proper\nfeeling!--so I told the Germans, in the publisher's own way, the\npublisher's tale of an apple and a pear.\n\nI at first felt much inclined to be of the publisher's opinion with\nrespect to the theory of the pear.  After all, why should the earth be\nshaped like an apple, and not like a pear?--it would certainly gain in\nappearance by being shaped like a pear.  A pear being a handsomer fruit\nthan an apple, the publisher is probably right, thought I, and I will say\nthat he is right on this point in the notice which I am about to write of\nhis publication for the Review.  And yet I don't know--said I, after a\nlong fit of musing--I don't know but what there is more to be said for\nthe Oxford theory.  The world may be shaped like a pear, but I don't know\nthat it is; but one thing I know, which is, that it does not taste like a\npear; I have always liked pears, but I don't like the world.  The world\nto me tastes much more like an apple, and I have never liked apples.  I\nwill uphold the Oxford theory--besides, I am writing in an Oxford Review,\nand am in duty bound to uphold the Oxford theory.  So in my notice I\nasserted that the world was round; I quoted Scripture, and endeavoured to\nprove that the world was typified by the apple in Scripture, both as to\nshape and properties.  'An apple is round,' said I, 'and the world is\nround--the apple is a sour, disagreeable fruit; and who has tasted much\nof the world without having his teeth set on edge?'  I, however, treated\nthe publisher, upon the whole, in the most urbane and Oxford-like manner;\ncomplimenting him upon his style, acknowledging the general soundness of\nhis views, and only differing with him in the affair of the apple and\npear.\n\n{picture:I did not like reviewing at all--it was not to my taste:\npage228.jpg}\n\nI did not like reviewing at all--it was not to my taste; it was not in my\nway; I liked it far less than translating the publisher's philosophy, for\nthat was something in the line of one whom a competent judge had surnamed\nLavengro.  I never could understand why reviews were instituted; works of\nmerit do not require to be reviewed, they can speak for themselves, and\nrequire no praising; works of no merit at all will die of themselves,\nthey require no killing.  The Review to which I was attached was, as has\nbeen already intimated, established on an entirely new plan; it professed\nto review all new publications, which certainly no Review had ever\nprofessed to do before, other Reviews never pretending to review more\nthan one-tenth of the current literature of the day.  When I say it\nprofessed to review all new publications, I should add, which should be\nsent to it; for, of course, the Review would not acknowledge the\nexistence of publications, the authors of which did not acknowledge the\nexistence of the Review.  I don't think, however, that the Review had\nmuch cause to complain of being neglected; I have reason to believe that\nat least nine-tenths of the publications of the day were sent to the\nReview, and in due time reviewed.  I had good opportunity of judging--I\nwas connected with several departments of the Review, though more\nparticularly with the poetical and philosophic ones.  An English\ntranslation of Kant's philosophy made its appearance on my table the day\nbefore its publication.  In my notice of this work I said that the\nEnglish shortly hoped to give the Germans a _quid pro quo_.  I believe at\nthat time authors were much in the habit of publishing at their own\nexpense.  All the poetry which I reviewed appeared to be published at the\nexpense of the authors.  If I am asked how I comported myself, under all\ncircumstances, as a reviewer--I answer,--I did not forget that I was\nconnected with a Review established on Oxford principles, the editor of\nwhich had translated Quintilian.  All the publications which fell under\nmy notice I treated in a gentlemanly and Oxford-like manner, no\npersonalities--no vituperation--no shabby insinuations; decorum, decorum\nwas the order of the day.  Occasionally a word of admonition, but gently\nexpressed, as an Oxford undergraduate might have expressed it, or master\nof arts.  How the authors whose publications were consigned to my\ncolleagues were treated by them I know not; I suppose they were treated\nin an urbane and Oxford-like manner, but I cannot say; I did not read the\nreviewals of my colleagues, I did not read my own after they were\nprinted.  I did not like reviewing.\n\nOf all my occupations at this period I am free to confess I liked that of\ncompiling the _Newgate Lives and Trials_ the best; that is, after I had\nsurmounted a kind of prejudice which I originally entertained.  The\ntrials were entertaining enough; but the lives--how full were they of\nwild and racy adventures, and in what racy, genuine language were they\ntold!  What struck me most with respect to these lives was the art which\nthe writers, whoever they were, possessed of telling a plain story.  It\nis no easy thing to tell a story plainly and distinctly by mouth; but to\ntell one on paper is difficult indeed, so many snares lie in the way.\nPeople are afraid to put down what is common on paper, they seek to\nembellish their narratives, as they think, by philosophic speculations\nand reflections; they are anxious to shine, and people who are anxious to\nshine can never tell a plain story.  'So I went with them to a music\nbooth, where they made me almost drunk with gin, and began to talk their\nflash language, which I did not understand,' says, or is made to say,\nHenry Simms, executed at Tyburn some seventy years before the time of\nwhich I am speaking.  I have always looked upon this sentence as a\nmasterpiece of the narrative style, it is so concise and yet so very\nclear.  As I gazed on passages like this, and there were many nearly as\ngood in the Newgate lives, I often sighed that it was not my fortune to\nhave to render these lives into German rather than the publisher's\nphilosophy--his tale of an apple and pear.\n\nMine was an ill-regulated mind at this period.  As I read over the lives\nof these robbers and pickpockets, strange doubts began to arise in my\nmind about virtue and crime.  Years before, when quite a boy, as in one\nof the early chapters I have hinted, I had been a necessitarian; I had\neven written an essay on crime (I have it now before me, penned in a\nround boyish hand), in which I attempted to prove that there is no such\nthing as crime or virtue, all our actions being the result of\ncircumstances or necessity.  These doubts were now again reviving in my\nmind; I could not, for the life of me, imagine how, taking all\ncircumstances into consideration, these highwaymen, these pickpockets,\nshould have been anything else than highwaymen and pickpockets; any more\nthan how, taking all circumstances into consideration, Bishop Latimer\n(the reader is aware that I had read Foxe's _Book of Martyrs_) should\nhave been anything else than Bishop Latimer.  I had a very ill-regulated\nmind at that period.\n\nMy own peculiar ideas with respect to everything being a lying dream\nbegan also to revive.  Sometimes at midnight, after having toiled for\nhours at my occupations, I would fling myself back on my chair, look\nabout the poor apartment, dimly lighted by an unsnuffed candle, or upon\nthe heaps of books and papers before me, and exclaim,--'Do I exist?  Do\nthese things, which I think I see about me, exist, or do they not?  Is\nnot everything a dream--a deceitful dream?  Is not this apartment a\ndream--the furniture a dream?  The publisher a dream--his philosophy a\ndream?  Am I not myself a dream--dreaming about translating a dream?  I\ncan't see why all should not be a dream; what's the use of the reality?'\nAnd then I would pinch myself, and snuff the burdened smoky light.  'I\ncan't see, for the life of me, the use of all this; therefore why should\nI think that it exists?  If there was a chance, a probability, of all\nthis tending to anything, I might believe; but--' and then I would stare\nand think, and after some time shake my head and return again to my\noccupations for an hour or two; and then I would perhaps shake, and\nshiver, and yawn, and look wistfully in the direction of my sleeping\napartment; and then, but not wistfully, at the papers and books before\nme; and sometimes I would return to my papers and books; but oftener I\nwould arise, and, after another yawn and shiver, take my light, and\nproceed to my sleeping chamber.\n\nThey say that light fare begets light dreams; my fare at that time was\nlight enough; but I had anything but light dreams, for at that period I\nhad all kind of strange and extravagant dreams, and amongst other things\nI dreamt that the whole world had taken to dog-fighting; and that I,\nmyself, had taken to dog-fighting, and that in a vast circus I backed an\nEnglish bulldog against the bloodhound of the Pope of Rome.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\n\nMy brother--Fits of crying--Mayor-elect--The committee--The Norman arch--A\nword of Greek--Church and State--At my own expense--If you please.\n\nOne morning I arose somewhat later than usual, having been occupied\nduring the greater part of the night with my literary toil.  On\ndescending from my chamber into the sitting-room I found a person seated\nby the fire, whose glance was directed sideways to the table, on which\nwere the usual preparations for my morning's meal.  Forthwith I gave a\ncry, and sprang forward to embrace the person; for the person by the\nfire, whose glance was directed to the table, was no one else than my\nbrother.\n\n'And how are things going on at home?' said I to my brother, after we had\nkissed and embraced.  'How is my mother, and how is the dog?'\n\n'My mother, thank God, is tolerably well,' said my brother, 'but very\nmuch given to fits of crying.  As for the dog, he is not so well; but we\nwill talk more of these matters anon,' said my brother, again glancing at\nthe breakfast things: 'I am very hungry, as you may suppose, after having\ntravelled all night.'\n\nThereupon I exerted myself to the best of my ability to perform the\nduties of hospitality, and I made my brother welcome--I may say more than\nwelcome; and, when the rage of my brother's hunger was somewhat abated,\nwe recommenced talking about the matters of our little family, and my\nbrother told me much about my mother; he spoke of her fits of crying, but\nsaid that of late the said fits of crying had much diminished, and she\nappeared to be taking comfort; and, if I am not much mistaken, my brother\ntold me that my mother had of late the Prayer-book frequently in her\nhand, and yet oftener the Bible.\n\nWe were silent for a time--at last I opened my mouth and mentioned the\ndog.\n\n'The dog,' said my brother, 'is, I am afraid, in a very poor way; ever\nsince the death he has done nothing but pine and take on.  A few months\nago, you remember, he was as plump and fine as any dog in the town; but\nat present he is little more than skin and bone.  Once we lost him for\ntwo days, and never expected to see him again, imagining that some\nmischance had befallen him; at length I found him--where do you think?\nChancing to pass by the churchyard, I found him seated on the grave!'\n\n'Very strange,' said I; 'but let us talk of something else.  It was very\nkind of you to come and see me.'\n\n'Oh, as for that matter, I did not come up to see you, though of course I\nam very glad to see you, having been rather anxious about you, like my\nmother, who has received only one letter from you since your departure.\nNo, I did not come up on purpose to see you; but on quite a different\naccount.  You must know that the corporation of our town have lately\nelected a new mayor, a person of many qualifications--big and portly,\nwith a voice like Boanerges; a religious man, the possessor of an immense\npew; loyal, so much so that I once heard him say that he would at any\ntime go three miles to hear any one sing \"God save the King\"; moreover, a\ngiver of excellent dinners.  Such is our present mayor; who, owing to his\nloyalty, his religion, and a little, perhaps, to his dinners, is a mighty\nfavourite; so much so that the town is anxious to have his portrait\npainted in a superior style, so that remote posterity may know what kind\nof man he was, the colour of his hair, his air and gait.  So a committee\nwas formed some time ago, which is still sitting; that is, they dine with\nthe mayor every day to talk over the subject.  A few days since, to my\ngreat surprise, they made their appearance in my poor studio, and desired\nto be favoured with a sight of some of my paintings; well, I showed them\nsome, and, after looking at them with great attention, they went aside\nand whispered.  \"He'll do,\" I heard one say; \"Yes, he'll do,\" said\nanother; and then they came to me, and one of them, a little man with a\nhump on his back, who is a watchmaker, assumed the office of spokesman,\nand made a long speech--(the old town has been always celebrated for\norators)--in which he told me how much they had been pleased with my\nproductions--(the old town has been always celebrated for its artistic\ntaste)--and, what do you think? offered me the painting of the mayor's\nportrait, and a hundred pounds for my trouble.  Well, of course I was\nmuch surprised, and for a minute or two could scarcely speak; recovering\nmyself, however, I made a speech, not so eloquent as that of the\nwatchmaker of course, being not so accustomed to speaking; but not so bad\neither, taking everything into consideration, telling them how flattered\nI felt by the honour which they had conferred in proposing to me such an\nundertaking; expressing, however, my fears that I was not competent to\nthe task, and concluding by saying what a pity it was that Crome was\ndead.  \"Crome,\" said the little man, \"Crome; yes, he was a clever man, a\nvery clever man in his way; he was good at painting landscapes and farm-\nhouses, but he would not do in the present instance were he alive.  He\nhad no conception of the heroic, sir.  We want some person capable of\nrepresenting our mayor striding under the Norman arch out of the\ncathedral.\"  At the mention of the heroic an idea came at once into my\nhead.  \"Oh,\" said I, \"if you are in quest of the heroic, I am glad that\nyou came to me; don't mistake me,\" I continued, \"I do not mean to say\nthat I could do justice to your subject, though I am fond of the heroic;\nbut I can introduce you to a great master of the heroic, fully competent\nto do justice to your mayor.  Not to me, therefore, be the painting of\nthe picture given, but to a friend of mine, the great master of the\nheroic, to the best, the strongest, [Greek text]\" I added, for, being\namongst orators, I thought a word of Greek would tell.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'and what did the orators say?'\n\n'They gazed dubiously at me and at one another,' said my brother; 'at\nlast the watchmaker asked me who this Mr. Christo was; adding, that he\nhad never heard of such a person; that, from my recommendation of him, he\nhad no doubt that he was a very clever man; but that they should like to\nknow something more about him before giving the commission to him.  That\nhe had heard of Christie the great auctioneer, who was considered to be\nan excellent judge of pictures; but he supposed that I\nscarcely--Whereupon, interrupting the watchmaker, I told him that I\nalluded neither to Christo nor to Christie; but to the painter of Lazarus\nrising from the grave, a painter under whom I had myself studied during\nsome months that I had spent in London, and to whom I was indebted for\nmuch connected with the heroic.\n\n'\"I have heard of him,\" said the watchmaker, \"and his paintings too; but\nI am afraid that he is not exactly the gentleman by whom our mayor would\nwish to be painted.  I have heard say that he is not a very good friend\nto Church and State.  Come, young man,\" he added, \"it appears to me that\nyou are too modest; I like your style of painting, so do we all, and--why\nshould I mince the matter?--the money is to be collected in the town, why\nshould it go into a stranger's pocket, and be spent in London?\"\n\n'Thereupon I made them a speech, in which I said that art had nothing to\ndo with Church and State, at least with English Church and State, which\nhad never encouraged it; and that, though Church and State were doubtless\nvery fine things, a man might be a very good artist who cared not a straw\nfor either.  I then made use of some more Greek words, and told them how\npainting was one of the Nine Muses, and one of the most independent\ncreatures alive, inspiring whom she pleased, and asking leave of nobody;\nthat I should be quite unworthy of the favours of the Muse if, on the\npresent occasion, I did not recommend them a man whom I considered to be\na much greater master of the heroic than myself; and that, with regard to\nthe money being spent in the city, I had no doubt that they would not\nweigh for a moment such a consideration against the chance of getting a\ntrue heroic picture for the city.  I never talked so well in my life, and\nsaid so many flattering things to the hunchback and his friends, that at\nlast they said that I should have my own way; and that if I pleased to go\nup to London, and bring down the painter of Lazarus to paint the mayor, I\nmight; so they then bade me farewell, and I have come up to London.'\n\n'To put a hundred pounds into the hands of--'\n\n'A better man than myself,' said my brother, 'of course.'\n\n'And have you come up at your own expense?'\n\n'Yes,' said my brother, 'I have come up at my own expense.'\n\nI made no answer, but looked in my brother's face.  We then returned to\nthe former subjects of conversation, talking of the dead, my mother, and\nthe dog.\n\nAfter some time my brother said, 'I will now go to the painter, and\ncommunicate to him the business which has brought me to town; and, if you\nplease, I will take you with me and introduce you to him.'  Having\nexpressed my willingness, we descended into the street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\n\nPainter of the heroic--I'll go!--A modest peep--Who is this?--A capital\nPharaoh--Disproportionably short--Imaginary picture--English figures.\n\nThe painter of the heroic resided a great way off, at the western end of\nthe town.  We had some difficulty in obtaining admission to him; a maid-\nservant, who opened the door, eyeing us somewhat suspiciously: it was not\nuntil my brother had said that he was a friend of the painter that we\nwere permitted to pass the threshold.  At length we were shown into the\nstudio, where we found the painter, with an easel and brush, standing\nbefore a huge piece of canvas, on which he had lately commenced painting\na heroic picture.  The painter might be about thirty-five years old; he\nhad a clever, intelligent countenance, with a sharp gray eye--his hair\nwas dark brown, and cut a-la-Rafael, as I was subsequently told, that is,\nthere was little before and much behind--he did not wear a neck-cloth;\nbut, in its stead, a black riband, so that his neck, which was rather\nfine, was somewhat exposed--he had a broad, muscular breast, and I make\nno doubt that he would have been a very fine figure, but unfortunately\nhis legs and thighs were somewhat short.  He recognised my brother, and\nappeared glad to see him.\n\n'What brings you to London?' said he.\n\nWhereupon my brother gave him a brief account of his commission.  At the\nmention of the hundred pounds, I observed the eyes of the painter\nglisten.  'Really,' said he, when my brother had concluded, 'it was very\nkind to think of me.  I am not very fond of painting portraits; but a\nmayor is a mayor, and there is something grand in that idea of the Norman\narch.  I'll go; moreover, I am just at this moment confoundedly in need\nof money, and when you knocked at the door, I don't mind telling you, I\nthought it was some dun.  I don't know how it is, but in the capital they\nhave no taste for the heroic, they will scarce look at a heroic picture;\nI am glad to hear that they have better taste in the provinces.  I'll go;\nwhen shall we set off?'\n\nThereupon it was arranged between the painter and my brother that they\nshould depart the next day but one; they then began to talk of art.  'I'll\nstick to the heroic,' said the painter; 'I now and then dabble in the\ncomic, but what I do gives me no pleasure, the comic is so low; there is\nnothing like the heroic.  I am engaged here on a heroic picture,' said\nhe, pointing to the canvas; 'the subject is \"Pharaoh dismissing Moses\nfrom Egypt,\" after the last plague--the death of the first-born; it is\nnot far advanced--that finished figure is Moses': they both looked at the\ncanvas, and I, standing behind, took a modest peep.  The picture, as the\npainter said, was not far advanced, the Pharaoh was merely in outline; my\neye was, of course, attracted by the finished figure, or rather what the\npainter had called the finished figure; but, as I gazed upon it, it\nappeared to me that there was something defective--something\nunsatisfactory in the figure.  I concluded, however, that the painter,\nnotwithstanding what he had said, had omitted to give it the finishing\ntouch.  'I intend this to be my best picture,' said the painter; 'what I\nwant now is a face for Pharaoh; I have long been meditating on a face for\nPharaoh.'  Here, chancing to cast his eye upon my countenance, of whom he\nhad scarcely taken any manner of notice, he remained with his mouth open\nfor some time.  'Who is this?' said he at last.  'Oh, this is my brother,\nI forgot to introduce him.' . . .\n\nWe presently afterwards departed; my brother talked much about the\npainter.  'He is a noble fellow,' said my brother; 'but, like many other\nnoble fellows, has a great many enemies; he is hated by his brethren of\nthe brush--all the land and water scape painters hate him--but, above\nall, the race of portrait-painters, who are ten times more numerous than\nthe other two sorts, detest him for his heroic tendencies.  It will be a\nkind of triumph to the last, I fear, when they hear he has condescended\nto paint a portrait; however, that Norman arch will enable him to escape\nfrom their malice--that is a capital idea of the watchmaker, that Norman\narch.'\n\nI spent a happy day with my brother.  On the morrow he went again to the\npainter, with whom he dined; I did not go with him.  On his return he\nsaid, 'The painter has been asking a great many questions about you, and\nexpressed a wish that you would sit to him as Pharaoh; he thinks you\nwould make a capital Pharaoh.'  'I have no wish to appear on canvas,'\nsaid I; 'moreover he can find much better Pharaohs than myself; and, if\nhe wants a real Pharaoh, there is a certain Mr. Petulengro.'\n'Petulengro?' said my brother; 'a strange kind of fellow came up to me\nsome time ago in our town, and asked me about you; when I inquired his\nname, he told me Petulengro.  No, he will not do, he is too short; by the\nbye, do you not think that figure of Moses is somewhat short?'  And then\nit appeared to me that I had thought the figure of Moses somewhat short,\nand I told my brother so.  'Ah!' said my brother.\n\nOn the morrow my brother departed with the painter for the old town, and\nthere the painter painted the mayor.  I did not see the picture for a\ngreat many years, when, chancing to be at the old town, I beheld it.\n\nThe original mayor was a mighty, portly man, with a bull's head, black\nhair, body like that of a dray horse, and legs and thighs corresponding;\na man six foot high at the least.  To his bull's head, black hair, and\nbody the painter had done justice; there was one point, however, in which\nthe portrait did not correspond with the original--the legs were\ndisproportionably short, the painter having substituted his own legs for\nthose of the mayor, which when I perceived I rejoiced that I had not\nconsented to be painted as Pharaoh, for, if I had, the chances are that\nhe would have served me in exactly a similar way as he had served Moses\nand the mayor.\n\nShort legs in a heroic picture will never do; and, upon the whole, I\nthink the painter's attempt at the heroic in painting the mayor of the\nold town a decided failure.  If I am now asked whether the picture would\nhave been a heroic one provided the painter had not substituted his own\nlegs for those of the mayor--I must say, I am afraid not.  I have no idea\nof making heroic pictures out of English mayors, even with the assistance\nof Norman arches; yet I am sure that capital pictures might be made out\nof English mayors, not issuing from Norman arches, but rather from the\ndoor of the 'Checquers' or the 'Brewers Three.'  The painter in question\nhad great comic power, which he scarcely ever cultivated; he would fain\nbe a Rafael, which he never could be, when he might have been something\nquite as good--another Hogarth; the only comic piece which he ever\npresented to the world being something little inferior to the best of\nthat illustrious master.  I have often thought what a capital picture\nmight have been made by my brother's friend, if, instead of making the\nmayor issue out of the Norman arch, he had painted him moving under the\nsign of the 'Checquers,' or the 'Three Brewers,' with mace--yes, with\nmace,--the mace appears in the picture issuing out of the Norman arch\nbehind the mayor,--but likewise with Snap, and with whiffler, quart pot,\nand frying-pan, Billy Blind and Owlenglass, Mr. Petulengro and\nPakomovna;--then, had he clapped his own legs upon the mayor, or any one\nelse in the concourse, what matter?  But I repeat that I have no hope of\nmaking heroic pictures out of English mayors, or, indeed, out of English\nfigures in general.  England may be a land of heroic hearts, but it is\nnot, properly, a land of heroic figures, or heroic posture-making.  Italy\n. . . what was I going to say about Italy?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\n\nNo authority whatever--Interference--Wondrous farrago--Brandt and\nStruensee--What a life!--The hearse--Mortal relics--Great poet--Fashion\nand fame--What a difference--Oh, beautiful--Good for nothing.\n\nAnd now once more to my pursuits, to my Lives and Trials.  However\npartial at first I might be to these lives and trials, it was not long\nbefore they became regular trials to me, owing to the whims and caprices\nof the publisher.  I had not been long connected with him before I\ndiscovered that he was wonderfully fond of interfering with other\npeople's business--at least with the business of those who were under his\ncontrol.  What a life did his unfortunate authors lead!  He had many in\nhis employ toiling at all kinds of subjects--I call them authors because\nthere is something respectable in the term author, though they had little\nauthorship in, and no authority whatever over, the works on which they\nwere engaged.  It is true the publisher interfered with some colour of\nreason, the plan of all and every of the works alluded to having\noriginated with himself; and, be it observed, many of his plans were\nhighly clever and promising, for, as I have already had occasion to say,\nthe publisher in many points was a highly clever and sagacious person;\nbut he ought to have been contented with planning the works originally,\nand have left to other people the task of executing them, instead of\nwhich he marred everything by his rage for interference.  If a book of\nfairy tales was being compiled, he was sure to introduce some of his\nphilosophy, explaining the fairy tale by some theory of his own.  Was a\nbook of anecdotes on hand, it was sure to be half filled with sayings and\ndoings of himself during the time that he was common councilman of the\nCity of London.  Now, however fond the public might be of fairy tales, it\nby no means relished them in conjunction with the publisher's philosophy;\nand however fond of anecdotes in general, or even of the publisher in\nparticular--for indeed there were a great many anecdotes in circulation\nabout him which the public both read and listened to very readily--it\ntook no pleasure in such anecdotes as he was disposed to relate about\nhimself.  In the compilation of my Lives and Trials I was exposed to\nincredible mortification, and ceaseless trouble, from this same rage for\ninterference.  It is true he could not introduce his philosophy into the\nwork, nor was it possible for him to introduce anecdotes of himself,\nhaving never had the good or evil fortune to be tried at the bar; but he\nwas continually introducing--what, under a less apathetic government than\nthe one then being, would have infallibly subjected him, and perhaps\nmyself, to a trial,--his politics; not his Oxford or pseudo politics, but\nthe politics which he really entertained, and which were of the most\nrepublican and violent kind.  But this was not all; when about a moiety\nof the first volume had been printed, he materially altered the plan of\nthe work; it was no longer to be a collection of mere Newgate lives and\ntrials, but of lives and trials of criminals in general, foreign as well\nas domestic.  In a little time the work became a wondrous farrago, in\nwhich Konigsmark the robber figured by the side of Sam Lynn, and the\nMarchioness de Brinvilliers was placed in contact with a Chinese outlaw.\nWhat gave me the most trouble and annoyance was the publisher's\nremembering some life or trial, foreign or domestic, which he wished to\nbe inserted, and which I was forthwith to go in quest of and purchase at\nmy own expense: some of those lives and trials were by no means easy to\nfind.  'Where is Brandt and Struensee?' cries the publisher; 'I am sure I\ndon't know,' I replied; whereupon the publisher falls to squealing like\none of Joey's rats.  'Find me up Brandt and Struensee by next morning,\nor--'  'Have you found Brandt and Struensee?' cried the publisher, on my\nappearing before him next morning.  'No,' I reply, 'I can hear nothing\nabout them'; whereupon the publisher falls to bellowing like Joey's bull.\nBy dint of incredible diligence, I at length discover the dingy volume\ncontaining the lives and trials of the celebrated two who had brooded\ntreason dangerous to the state of Denmark.  I purchase the dingy volume,\nand bring it in triumph to the publisher, the perspiration running down\nmy brow.  The publisher takes the dingy volume in his hand, he examines\nit attentively, then puts it down; his countenance is calm for a moment,\nalmost benign.  Another moment and there is a gleam in the publisher's\nsinister eye; he snatches up the paper containing the names of the\nworthies which I have intended shall figure in the forthcoming volumes--he\nglances rapidly over it, and his countenance once more assumes a terrific\nexpression.  'How is this?' he exclaims; 'I can scarcely believe my\neyes--the most important life and trial omitted to be found in the whole\ncriminal record--what gross, what utter negligence!  Where's the life of\nFarmer Patch? where's the trial of Yeoman Patch?'\n\n'What a life! what a dog's life!' I would frequently exclaim, after\nescaping from the presence of the publisher.\n\nOne day, after a scene with the publisher similar to that which I have\ndescribed above, I found myself about noon at the bottom of Oxford\nStreet, where it forms a right angle with the road which leads or did\nlead to Tottenham Court.  Happening to cast my eyes around, it suddenly\noccurred to me that something uncommon was expected; people were standing\nin groups on the pavement--the upstair windows of the houses were\nthronged with faces, especially those of women, and many of the shops\nwere partly, and not a few entirely, closed.  What could be the reason of\nall this?  All at once I bethought me that this street of Oxford was no\nother than the far-famed Tyburn way.  Oh, oh, thought I, an execution;\nsome handsome young robber is about to be executed at the farther end;\njust so, see how earnestly the women are peering; perhaps another Harry\nSimms--Gentleman Harry as they called him--is about to be carted along\nthis street to Tyburn tree; but then I remembered that Tyburn tree had\nlong since been cut down, and that criminals, whether young or old, good-\nlooking or ugly, were executed before the big stone gaol, which I had\nlooked at with a kind of shudder during my short rambles in the City.\nWhat could be the matter? just then I heard various voices cry, 'There it\ncomes!' and all heads were turned up Oxford Street, down which a hearse\nwas slowly coming: nearer and nearer it drew; presently it was just\nopposite the place where I was standing, when, turning to the left, it\nproceeded slowly along Tottenham Road; immediately behind the hearse were\nthree or four mourning coaches, full of people, some of whom, from the\npartial glimpse which I caught of them, appeared to be foreigners; behind\nthese came a very long train of splendid carriages, all of which, without\none exception, were empty.\n\n'Whose body is in that hearse?' said I to a dapper-looking individual,\nseemingly a shopkeeper, who stood beside me on the pavement, looking at\nthe procession.\n\n'The mortal relics of Lord Byron,' said the dapper-looking individual,\nmouthing his words and smirking--'the illustrious poet, which have been\njust brought from Greece, and are being conveyed to the family vault in\n---shire.'\n\n'An illustrious poet, was he?' said I.\n\n'Beyond all criticism,' said the dapper man; 'all we of the rising\ngeneration are under incalculable obligation to Byron; I myself, in\nparticular, have reason to say so; in all my correspondence my style is\nformed on the Byronic model.'\n\nI looked at the individual for a moment, who smiled and smirked to\nhimself applause, and then I turned my eyes upon the hearse proceeding\nslowly up the almost endless street.  This man, this Byron, had for many\nyears past been the demigod of England, and his verses the daily food of\nthose who read, from the peer to the draper's assistant; all were\nadmirers, or rather worshippers, of Byron, and all doated on his verses;\nand then I thought of those who, with genius as high as his, or higher,\nhad lived and died neglected.  I thought of Milton abandoned to poverty\nand blindness; of witty and ingenious Butler consigned to the tender\nmercies of bailiffs; and starving Otway: they had lived neglected and\ndespised, and, when they died, a few poor mourners only had followed them\nto the grave; but this Byron had been made a half god of when living, and\nnow that he was dead he was followed by worshipping crowds, and the very\nsun seemed to come out on purpose to grace his funeral.  And, indeed, the\nsun, which for many days past had hidden its face in clouds, shone out\nthat morn with wonderful brilliancy, flaming upon the black hearse and\nits tall ostrich plumes, the mourning coaches, and the long train of\naristocratic carriages which followed behind.\n\n'Great poet, sir,' said the dapper-looking man, 'great poet, but\nunhappy.'\n\nUnhappy? yes, I had heard that he had been unhappy; that he had roamed\nabout a fevered, distempered man, taking pleasure in nothing--that I had\nheard; but was it true? was he really unhappy? was not this unhappiness\nassumed, with the view of increasing the interest which the world took in\nhim? and yet who could say?  He might be unhappy, and with reason.  Was\nhe a real poet after all? might he not doubt himself? might he not have a\nlurking consciousness that he was undeserving of the homage which he was\nreceiving? that it could not last? that he was rather at the top of\nfashion than of fame?  He was a lordling, a glittering, gorgeous\nlordling: and he might have had a consciousness that he owed much of his\ncelebrity to being so; he might have felt that he was rather at the top\nof fashion than of fame.  Fashion soon changes, thought I, eagerly to\nmyself--a time will come, and that speedily, when he will be no longer in\nthe fashion; when this idiotic admirer of his, who is still grinning at\nmy side, shall have ceased to mould his style on Byron's; and this\naristocracy, squirearchy, and what not, who now send their empty\ncarriages to pay respect to the fashionable corpse, shall have\ntransferred their empty worship to some other animate or inanimate thing.\nWell, perhaps after all it was better to have been mighty Milton in his\npoverty and blindness--witty and ingenious Butler consigned to the tender\nmercies of bailiffs, and starving Otway; they might enjoy more real\npleasure than this lordling; they must have been aware that the world\nwould one day do them justice--fame after death is better than the top of\nfashion in life.  They have left a fame behind them which shall never\ndie, whilst this lordling--a time will come when he will be out of\nfashion and forgotten.  And yet I don't know; didn't he write Childe\nHarold and that ode?  Yes, he wrote Childe Harold and that ode.  Then a\ntime will scarcely come when he will be forgotten.  Lords, squires, and\ncockneys may pass away, but a time will scarcely come when Childe Harold\nand that ode will be forgotten.  He was a poet, after all, and he must\nhave known it; a real poet, equal to--to--what a destiny!  Rank, beauty,\nfashion, immortality,--he could not be unhappy; what a difference in the\nfate of men--I wish I could think he was unhappy . . . .\n\nI turned away.\n\n'Great poet, sir,' said the dapper man, turning away too, 'but\nunhappy--fate of genius, sir; I, too, am frequently unhappy.'\n\nHurrying down a street to the right, I encountered Francis Ardry.\n\n'What means the multitude yonder?' he demanded.\n\n'They are looking after the hearse which is carrying the remains of Byron\nup Tottenham Road.'\n\n'I have seen the man,' said my friend, as he turned back the way he had\ncome, 'so I can dispense with seeing the hearse--I saw the living man at\nVenice--ah, a great poet.'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'a great poet, it must be so, everybody says so--what a\ndestiny!  What a difference in the fate of men; but 'tis said he was\nunhappy; you have seen him, how did he look?'\n\n'Oh, beautiful!'\n\n'But did he look happy?'\n\n'Why, I can't say he looked very unhappy; I saw him with two . . . very\nfair ladies; but what is it to you whether the man was unhappy or not?\nCome, where shall we go--to Joey's?  His hugest bear--'\n\n'Oh, I have had enough of bears, I have just been worried by one.'\n\n'The publisher?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Then come to Joey's, three dogs are to be launched at his bear: as they\npin him, imagine him to be the publisher.'\n\n'No,' said I, 'I am good for nothing; I think I shall stroll to London\nBridge.'\n\n'That's too far for me--farewell.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\n\nLondon Bridge--Why not?--Every heart has its bitters--Wicked boys--Give\nme my book--Such a fright--Honour bright.\n\nSo I went to London Bridge, and again took my station on the spot by the\nbooth where I had stood on the former occasion.  The booth, however, was\nempty; neither the apple-woman nor her stall was to be seen.  I looked\nover the balustrade upon the river; the tide was now, as before, rolling\nbeneath the arch with frightful impetuosity.  As I gazed upon the eddies\nof the whirlpool, I thought within myself how soon human life would\nbecome extinct there; a plunge, a convulsive flounder, and all would be\nover.  When I last stood over that abyss I had felt a kind of impulse--a\nfascination; I had resisted it--I did not plunge into it.  At present I\nfelt a kind of impulse to plunge; but the impulse was of a different\nkind; it proceeded from a loathing of life, I looked wistfully at the\neddies--what had I to live for?--what, indeed!  I thought of Brandt and\nStruensee, and Yeoman Patch--should I yield to the impulse--why not?  My\neyes were fixed on the eddies.  All of a sudden I shuddered; I thought I\nsaw heads in the pool; human bodies wallowing confusedly; eyes turned up\nto heaven with hopeless horror; was that water or--?  Where was the\nimpulse now?  I raised my eyes from the pool, I looked no more upon it--I\nlooked forward, far down the stream in the far distance.  'Ha! what is\nthat?  I thought I saw a kind of Fata Morgana, green meadows, waving\ngroves, a rustic home; but in the far distance--I stared--I stared--a\nFata Morgana--it was gone. . . . '\n\nI left the balustrade and walked to the farther end of the bridge, where\nI stood for some time contemplating the crowd; I then passed over to the\nother side with an intention of returning home; just half-way over the\nbridge, in a booth immediately opposite to the one in which I had\nformerly beheld her, sat my friend, the old apple-woman, huddled up\nbehind her stall.\n\n'Well, mother,' said I, 'how are you?'  The old woman lifted her head\nwith a startled look.\n\n'Don't you know me?' said I.\n\n'Yes, I think I do.  Ah, yes,' said she, as her features beamed with\nrecollection, 'I know you, dear; you are the young lad that gave me the\ntanner.  Well, child, got anything to sell?'\n\n'Nothing at all,' said I.\n\n'Bad luck?'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'bad enough, and ill usage.'\n\n'Ah, I suppose they caught ye; well, child, never mind, better luck next\ntime; I am glad to see you.'\n\n'Thank you,' said I, sitting down on the stone bench; 'I thought you had\nleft the bridge--why have you changed your side?'\n\nThe old woman shook.\n\n'What is the matter with you,' said I; 'are you ill?'\n\n'No, child, no; only--'\n\n'Only what?  Any bad news of your son?'\n\n'No, child, no; nothing about my son.  Only low, child--every heart has\nits bitters.'\n\n'That's true,' said I; 'well, I don't want to know your sorrows; come,\nwhere's the book?'\n\nThe apple-woman shook more violently than before, bent herself down, and\ndrew her cloak more closely about her than before.  'Book, child, what\nbook?'\n\n'Why, blessed Mary, to be sure.'\n\n'Oh, that; I ha'n't got it, child--I have lost it, have left it at home.'\n\n'Lost it,' said I; 'left it at home--what do you mean?  Come, let me have\nit.'\n\n'I ha'n't got it, child.'\n\n'I believe you have got it under your cloak.'\n\n'Don't tell any one, dear; don't--don't,' and the apple-woman burst into\ntears.\n\n'What's the matter with you?' said I, staring at her.\n\n'You want to take my book from me?'\n\n'Not I, I care nothing about it; keep it, if you like, only tell me\nwhat's the matter?'\n\n'Why, all about that book.'\n\n'The book?'\n\n'Yes, they wanted to take it from me.'\n\n'Who did?'\n\n'Why, some wicked boys.  I'll tell you all about it.  Eight or ten days\nago, I sat behind my stall, reading my book; all of a sudden I felt it\nsnatched from my hand, up I started, and see three rascals of boys\ngrinning at me; one of them held the book in his hand.  \"What book is\nthis?\" said he, grinning at it.  \"What do you want with my book?\" said I,\nclutching at it over my stall; \"give me my book.\"  \"What do you want a\nbook for?\" said he, holding it back; \"I have a good mind to fling it into\nthe Thames.\"  \"Give me my book,\" I shrieked; and, snatching at it, I fell\nover my stall, and all my fruit was scattered about.  Off ran the\nboys--off ran the rascal with my book.  Oh dear, I thought I should have\ndied; up I got, however, and ran after them as well as I could; I thought\nof my fruit, but I thought more of my book.  I left my fruit and ran\nafter my book.  \"My book! my book!\" I shrieked, \"murder! theft! robbery!\"\nI was near being crushed under the wheels of a cart; but I didn't care--I\nfollowed the rascals.  \"Stop them! stop them!\"  I ran nearly as fast as\nthey--they couldn't run very fast on account of the crowd.  At last some\none stopped the rascal, whereupon he turned round, and flinging the book\nat me, it fell into the mud; well, I picked it up and kissed it, all\nmuddy as it was.  \"Has he robbed you?\" said the man.  \"Robbed me, indeed;\nwhy he had got my book.\"  \"Oh, your book,\" said the man, and laughed, and\nlet the rascal go.  Ah, he might laugh, but--'\n\n'Well, go on.'\n\n'My heart beats so.  Well, I went back to my booth and picked up my stall\nand my fruits, what I could find of them.  I couldn't keep my stall for\ntwo days I got such a fright, and when I got round I couldn't bide the\nbooth where the thing had happened, so I came over to the other side.  Oh,\nthe rascals, if I could but see them hanged.'\n\n'For what?'\n\n'Why, for stealing my book.'\n\n'I thought you didn't dislike stealing,--that you were ready to buy\nthings--there was your son, you know--'\n\n'Yes, to be sure.'\n\n'He took things.'\n\n'To be sure he did.'\n\n'But you don't like a thing of yours to be taken.'\n\n'No, that's quite a different thing; what's stealing handkerchiefs, and\nthat kind of thing, to do with taking my book? there's a wide\ndifference--don't you see?'\n\n'Yes, I see.'\n\n'Do you, dear? well, bless your heart, I'm glad you do.  Would you like\nto look at the book?'\n\n'Well, I think I should.'\n\n'Honour bright?' said the apple-woman, looking me in the eyes.\n\n'Honour bright,' said I, looking the apple-woman in the eyes.\n\n'Well then, dear, here it is,' said she, taking it from under her cloak;\n'read it as long as you like, only get a little farther into the booth--\nDon't sit so near the edge--you might--'\n\nI went deep into the booth, and the apple-woman, bringing her chair\nround, almost confronted me.  I commenced reading the book, and was soon\nengrossed by it; hours passed away, once or twice I lifted up my eyes,\nthe apple-woman was still confronting me: at last my eyes began to ache,\nwhereupon I returned the book to the apple-woman, and, giving her another\ntanner, walked away.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\n\nDecease of the Review--Homer himself--Bread and cheese--Finger and\nthumb--Impossible to find--Something grand--Universal mixture--Some other\npublisher.\n\nTime passed away, and with it the Review, which, contrary to the\npublisher's expectation, did not prove a successful speculation.  About\nfour months after the period of its birth it expired, as all Reviews must\nfor which there is no demand.  Authors had ceased to send their\npublications to it, and, consequently, to purchase it; for I have already\nhinted that it was almost entirely supported by authors of a particular\nclass, who expected to see their publications foredoomed to immortality\nin its pages.  The behaviour of these authors towards this unfortunate\npublication I can attribute to no other cause than to a report which was\nindustriously circulated, namely, that the Review was low, and that to be\nreviewed in it was an infallible sign that one was a low person, who\ncould be reviewed nowhere else.  So authors took fright; and no wonder,\nfor it will never do for an author to be considered low.  Homer himself\nhas never yet entirely recovered from the injury he received by Lord\nChesterfield's remark that the speeches of his heroes were frequently\nexceedingly low.\n\nSo the Review ceased, and the reviewing corps no longer existed as such;\nthey forthwith returned to their proper avocations--the editor to compose\ntunes on his piano, and to the task of disposing of the remaining copies\nof his Quintilian--the inferior members to working for the publisher,\nbeing to a man dependants of his; one, to composing fairy tales; another,\nto collecting miracles of Popish saints; and a third, Newgate lives and\ntrials.  Owing to the bad success of the Review, the publisher became\nmore furious than ever.  My money was growing short, and I one day asked\nhim to pay me for my labours in the deceased publication.\n\n'Sir,' said the publisher, 'what do you want the money for?'\n\n'Merely to live on,' I replied; 'it is very difficult to live in this\ntown without money.'\n\n'How much money did you bring with you to town?' demanded the publisher.\n\n'Some twenty or thirty pounds,' I replied.\n\n'And you have spent it already?'\n\n'No,' said I, 'not entirely; but it is fast disappearing.'\n\n'Sir,' said the publisher, 'I believe you to be extravagant; yes, sir,\nextravagant!'\n\n'On what grounds do you suppose me to be so?'\n\n'Sir,' said the publisher, 'you eat meat.'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'I eat meat sometimes; what should I eat?'\n\n'Bread, sir,' said the publisher; 'bread and cheese.'\n\n'So I do, sir, when I am disposed to indulge; but I cannot often afford\nit--it is very expensive to dine on bread and cheese, especially when one\nis fond of cheese, as I am.  My last bread and cheese dinner cost me\nfourteenpence.  There is drink, sir; with bread and cheese one must drink\nporter, sir.'\n\n'Then, sir, eat bread--bread alone.  As good men as yourself have eaten\nbread alone; they have been glad to get it, sir.  If with bread and\ncheese you must drink porter, sir, with bread alone you can, perhaps,\ndrink water, sir.'\n\nHowever, I got paid at last for my writings in the Review, not, it is\ntrue, in the current coin of the realm, but in certain bills; there were\ntwo of them, one payable at twelve, and the other at eighteen months\nafter date.  It was a long time before I could turn these bills to any\naccount; at last I found a person who, at a discount of only thirty per\ncent, consented to cash them; not, however, without sundry grimaces, and,\nwhat was still more galling, holding, more than once, the unfortunate\npapers high in air between his forefinger and thumb.  So ill, indeed, did\nI like this last action, that I felt much inclined to snatch them away.  I\nrestrained myself, however, for I remembered that it was very difficult\nto live without money, and that, if the present person did not discount\nthe bills, I should probably find no one else that would.\n\nBut if the treatment which I had experienced from the publisher, previous\nto making this demand upon him, was difficult to bear, that which I\nsubsequently underwent was far more so: his great delight seemed to\nconsist in causing me misery and mortification; if, on former occasions,\nhe was continually sending me in quest of lives and trials difficult to\nfind, he now was continually demanding lives and trials which it was\nimpossible to find; the personages whom he mentioned never having lived,\nnor consequently been tried.  Moreover, some of my best lives and trials\nwhich I had corrected and edited with particular care, and on which I\nprided myself no little, he caused to be cancelled after they had passed\nthrough the press.  Amongst these was the life of 'Gentleman Harry.'\n'They are drugs, sir,' said the publisher, 'drugs; that life of Harry\nSimms has long been the greatest drug in the calendar--has it not,\nTaggart?'\n\nTaggart made no answer save by taking a pinch of snuff.  The reader, has,\nI hope, not forgotten Taggart, whom I mentioned whilst giving an account\nof my first morning's visit to the publisher.  I beg Taggart's pardon for\nhaving been so long silent about him; but he was a very silent man--yet\nthere was much in Taggart--and Taggart had always been civil and kind to\nme in his peculiar way.\n\n'Well, young gentleman,' said Taggart to me one morning, when we chanced\nto be alone a few days after the affair of the cancelling, 'how do you\nlike authorship?'\n\n'I scarcely call authorship the drudgery I am engaged in,' said I.\n\n'What do you call authorship?' said Taggart.\n\n'I scarcely know,' said I; 'that is, I can scarcely express what I think\nit.'\n\n'Shall I help you out?' said Taggart, turning round his chair, and\nlooking at me.\n\n'If you like,' said I.\n\n'To write something grand,' said Taggart, taking snuff; 'to be stared\nat--lifted on people's shoulders--'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'that is something like it.'\n\nTaggart took snuff.  'Well,' said he, 'why don't you write something\ngrand?'\n\n'I have,' said I.\n\n'What?' said Taggart.\n\n'Why,' said I, 'there are those ballads.'\n\nTaggart took snuff.\n\n'And those wonderful versions from Ab Gwilym.'\n\nTaggart took snuff again.\n\n'You seem to be very fond of snuff,' said I, looking at him angrily.\n\nTaggart tapped his box.\n\n'Have you taken it long?'\n\n'Three-and-twenty years.'\n\n'What snuff do you take?'\n\n'Universal mixture.'\n\n'And you find it of use?\n\nTaggart tapped his box.\n\n'In what respect?' said I.\n\n'In many--there is nothing like it to get a man through; but for snuff I\nshould scarcely be where I am now.'\n\n'Have you been long here?'\n\n'Three-and-twenty years.'\n\n'Dear me,' said I; 'and snuff brought you through?  Give me a pinch--pah,\nI don't like it,' and I sneezed.\n\n'Take another pinch,' said Taggart.\n\n'No,' said I, 'I don't like snuff.'\n\n'Then you will never do for authorship; at least for this kind.'\n\n'So I begin to think--what shall I do?'\n\nTaggart took snuff.\n\n'You were talking of a great work--what shall it be?'\n\nTaggart took snuff.\n\n'Do you think I could write one?'\n\nTaggart uplifted his two forefingers as if to tap, he did not however.\n\n'It would require time,' said I, with a half sigh.\n\nTaggart tapped his box.\n\n'A great deal of time; I really think that my ballads--'\n\nTaggart took snuff.\n\n'If published, would do me credit.  I'll make an effort, and offer them\nto some other publisher.'\n\nTaggart took a double quantity of snuff.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\n\nFrancis Ardry--That won't do, sir--Observe my gestures--I think you\nimprove--Better than politics--Delightful young Frenchwoman--A burning\nshame--Magnificent impudence--Paunch--Voltaire--Lump of sugar.\n\nOccasionally I called on Francis Ardry.  This young gentleman resided in\nhandsome apartments in the neighbourhood of a fashionable square, kept a\nlivery servant, and, upon the whole, lived in very good style.  Going to\nsee him one day, between one and two, I was informed by the servant that\nhis master was engaged for the moment, but that, if I pleased to wait a\nfew minutes, I should find him at liberty.  Having told the man that I\nhad no objection, he conducted me into a small apartment which served as\nantechamber to a drawing-room; the door of this last being half open, I\ncould see Francis Ardry at the farther end, speechifying and\ngesticulating in a very impressive manner.  The servant, in some\nconfusion, was hastening to close the door; but, ere he could effect his\npurpose, Francis Ardry, who had caught a glimpse of me, exclaimed, 'Come\nin--come in by all means'; and then proceeded, as before, speechifying\nand gesticulating.  Filled with some surprise, I obeyed his summons.\n\nOn entering the room I perceived another individual, to whom Francis\nArdry appeared to be addressing himself; this other was a short spare man\nof about sixty; his hair was of badger gray, and his face was covered\nwith wrinkles--without vouchsafing me a look, he kept his eye, which was\nblack and lustrous, fixed full on Francis Ardry, as if paying the deepest\nattention to his discourse.  All of a sudden, however, he cried with a\nsharp, cracked voice, 'That won't do, sir; that won't do--more\nvehemence--your argument is at present particularly weak; therefore, more\nvehemence--you must confuse them, stun them, stultify them, sir'; and, at\neach of these injunctions, he struck the back of his right hand sharply\nagainst the palm of the left.  'Good, sir--good!' he occasionally\nuttered, in the same sharp, cracked tone, as the voice of Francis Ardry\nbecame more and more vehement.  'Infinitely good!' he exclaimed, as\nFrancis Ardry raised his voice to the highest pitch; 'and now, sir,\nabate; let the tempest of vehemence decline--gradually, sir; not too\nfast.  Good, sir--very good!' as the voice of Francis Ardry declined\ngradually in vehemence.  'And now a little pathos, sir--try them with a\nlittle pathos.  That won't do, sir--that won't do,'--as Francis Ardry\nmade an attempt to become pathetic,--'that will never pass for\npathos--with tones and gesture of that description you will never redress\nthe wrongs of your country.  Now, sir, observe my gestures, and pay\nattention to the tone of my voice, sir.'\n\nThereupon, making use of nearly the same terms which Francis Ardry had\nemployed, the individual in black uttered several sentences in tones and\nwith gestures which were intended to express a considerable degree of\npathos, though it is possible that some people would have thought both\nthe one and the other highly ludicrous.  After a pause, Francis Ardry\nrecommenced imitating the tones and the gestures of his monitor in the\nmost admirable manner.  Before he had proceeded far, however, he burst\ninto a fit of laughter, in which I should, perhaps, have joined, provided\nit were ever my wont to laugh.  'Ha, ha!' said the other,\ngood-humouredly, 'you are laughing at me.  Well, well, I merely wished to\ngive you a hint; but you saw very well what I meant; upon the whole I\nthink you improve.  But I must now go, having two other pupils to visit\nbefore four.'\n\nThen taking from the table a kind of three-cornered hat, and a cane\nheaded with amber, he shook Francis Ardry by the hand; and, after\nglancing at me for a moment, made me a half bow, attended with a strange\ngrimace, and departed.\n\n'Who is that gentleman?' said I to Francis Ardry, as soon as were alone.\n\n'Oh, that is--' said Frank, smiling, 'the gentleman who gives me lessons\nin elocution.'\n\n'And what need have you of elocution?'\n\n'Oh, I merely obey the commands of my guardians,' said Francis, 'who\ninsist that I should, with the assistance of ---, qualify myself for\nParliament; for which they do me the honour to suppose that I have some\nnatural talent.  I dare not disobey them; for, at the present moment, I\nhave particular reasons for wishing to keep on good terms with them.'\n\n'But,' said I, 'you are a Roman Catholic; and I thought that persons of\nyour religion were excluded from Parliament?'\n\n'Why, upon that very thing the whole matter hinges; people of our\nreligion are determined to be no longer excluded from Parliament, but to\nhave a share in the government of the nation.  Not that I care anything\nabout the matter; I merely obey the will of my guardians; my thoughts are\nfixed on something better than politics.'\n\n'I understand you,' said I; 'dog-fighting--well, I can easily conceive\nthat to some minds dog-fighting--'\n\n'I was not thinking of dog-fighting,' said Francis Ardry, interrupting\nme.\n\n'Not thinking of dog-fighting!' I ejaculated.\n\n'No,' said Francis Ardry, 'something higher and much more rational than\ndog-fighting at present occupies my thoughts.'\n\n'Dear me,' said I, 'I thought I had heard you say that there was nothing\nlike it!'\n\n'Like what?' said Francis Ardry.\n\n'Dog-fighting, to be sure,' said I.\n\n'Pooh,' said Francis Ardry; 'who but the gross and unrefined care\nanything for dog-fighting?  That which at present engages my waking and\nsleeping thoughts is love--divine love--there is nothing like _that_.\nListen to me, I have a secret to confide to you.'\n\nAnd then Francis Ardry proceeded to make me his confidant.  It appeared\nthat he had had the good fortune to make the acquaintance of the most\ndelightful young Frenchwoman imaginable, Annette La Noire by name, who\nhad just arrived from her native country with the intention of obtaining\nthe situation of governess in some English family; a position which, on\naccount of her many accomplishments, she was eminently qualified to fill.\nFrancis Ardry had, however, persuaded her to relinquish her intention for\nthe present, on the ground that, until she had become acclimated in\nEngland, her health would probably suffer from the confinement\ninseparable from the occupation in which she was desirous of engaging; he\nhad, moreover--for it appeared that she was the most frank and confiding\ncreature in the world--succeeded in persuading her to permit him to hire\nfor her a very handsome first floor in his own neighbourhood, and to\naccept a few inconsiderable presents in money and jewellery.  'I am\nlooking out for a handsome gig and horse,' said Francis Ardry, at the\nconclusion of his narration; 'it were a burning shame that so divine a\ncreature should have to go about a place like London on foot, or in a\npaltry hackney coach.'\n\n'But,' said I, 'will not the pursuit of politics prevent your devoting\nmuch time to this fair lady?'\n\n'It will prevent me devoting all my time,' said Francis Ardry, 'as I\ngladly would; but what can I do?  My guardians wish me to qualify myself\nfor a political orator, and I dare not offend them by a refusal.  If I\noffend my guardians, I should find it impossible--unless I have recourse\nto Jews and money-lenders--to support Annette; present her with articles\nof dress and jewellery, and purchase a horse and cabriolet worthy of\nconveying her angelic person through the streets of London.'\n\nAfter a pause, in which Francis Ardry appeared lost in thought, his mind\nbeing probably occupied with the subject of Annette, I broke silence by\nobserving, 'So your fellow-religionists are really going to make a\nserious attempt to procure their emancipation?'\n\n'Yes,' said Francis Ardry, starting from his reverie; 'everything has\nbeen arranged; even a leader has been chosen, at least for us of Ireland,\nupon the whole the most suitable man in the world for the occasion--a\nbarrister of considerable talent, mighty voice, and magnificent\nimpudence.  With emancipation, liberty, and redress for the wrongs of\nIreland in his mouth, he is to force his way into the British House of\nCommons, dragging myself and others behind him--he will succeed, and when\nhe is in he will cut a figure; I have heard--himself, who has heard him\nspeak, say that he will cut a figure.'\n\n'And is--competent to judge?' I demanded.\n\n'Who but he?' said Francis Ardry; 'no one questions his judgment\nconcerning what relates to elocution.  His fame on that point is so well\nestablished, that the greatest orators do not disdain occasionally to\nconsult him; C--- himself, as I have been told, when anxious to produce\nany particular effect in the House, is in the habit of calling in--for a\nconsultation.'\n\n'As to matter, or manner?' said I.\n\n'Chiefly the latter,' said Francis Ardry, 'though he is competent to give\nadvice as to both, for he has been an orator in his day, and a leader of\nthe people; though he confessed to me that he was not exactly qualified\nto play the latter part--\"I want paunch,\" said he.'\n\n'It is not always indispensable,' said I; 'there is an orator in my town,\na hunchback and watchmaker, without it, who not only leads the people,\nbut the mayor too; perhaps he has a succedaneum in his hunch: but, tell\nme, is the leader of your movement in possession of that which--wants?'\n\n'No more deficient in it than in brass,' said Francis Ardry.\n\n'Well,' said I, 'whatever his qualifications may be, I wish him success\nin the cause which he has taken up--I love religious liberty.'\n\n'We shall succeed,' said Francis Ardry; 'John Bull upon the whole is\nrather indifferent on the subject, and then we are sure to be backed by\nthe Radical party, who, to gratify their political prejudices, would join\nwith Satan himself.'\n\n'There is one thing,' said I, 'connected with this matter which surprises\nme--your own lukewarmness.  Yes, making every allowance for your natural\npredilection for dog-fighting, and your present enamoured state of mind,\nyour apathy at the commencement of such a movement is to me\nunaccountable.'\n\n'You would not have cause to complain of my indifference,' said Frank,\n'provided I thought my country would be benefited by this movement; but I\nhappen to know the origin of it.  The priests are the originators, 'and\nwhat country was ever benefited by a movement which owed its origin to\nthem?' so says Voltaire, a page of whom I occasionally read.  By the\npresent move they hope to increase their influence, and to further\ncertain designs which they entertain both with regard to this country and\nIreland.  I do not speak rashly or unadvisedly.  A strange fellow--a half-\nItalian, half-English priest,--who was recommended to me by my guardians,\npartly as a spiritual, partly as a temporal guide, has let me into a\nsecret or two; he is fond of a glass of gin and water--and over a glass\nof gin and water cold, with a lump of sugar in it, he has been more\ncommunicative, perhaps, than was altogether prudent.  Were I my own\nmaster, I would kick him, politics, and religious movements, to a\nconsiderable distance.  And now, if you are going away, do so quickly; I\nhave an appointment with Annette, and must make myself fit to appear\nbefore her.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\n\nProgress--Glorious John--Utterly unintelligible--What a difference.\n\nBy the month of October I had, in spite of all difficulties and\nobstacles, accomplished about two-thirds of the principal task which I\nhad undertaken, the compiling of the Newgate lives; I had also made some\nprogress in translating the publisher's philosophy into German.  But\nabout this time I began to see very clearly that it was impossible that\nour connection should prove of long duration; yet, in the event of my\nleaving the big man, what other resource had I--another publisher?  But\nwhat had I to offer?  There were my ballads, my Ab Gwilym, but then I\nthought of Taggart and his snuff, his pinch of snuff.  However, I\ndetermined to see what could be done, so I took my ballads under my arm,\nand went to various publishers; some took snuff, others did not, but none\ntook my ballads or Ab Gwilym, they would not even look at them.  One\nasked me if I had anything else--he was a snuff-taker--I said yes; and\ngoing home, returned with my translation of the German novel, to which I\nhave before alluded.  After keeping it for a fortnight, he returned it to\nme on my visiting him, and, taking a pinch of snuff, told me it would not\ndo.  There were marks of snuff on the outside of the manuscript, which\nwas a roll of paper bound with red tape, but there were no marks of snuff\non the interior of the manuscript, from which I concluded that he had\nnever opened it.\n\nI had often heard of one Glorious John, who lived at the western end of\nthe town; on consulting Taggart, he told me that it was possible that\nGlorious John would publish my ballads and Ab Gwilym, that is, said he,\ntaking a pinch of snuff, provided you can see him; so I went to the house\nwhere Glorious John resided, and a glorious house it was, but I could not\nsee Glorious John--I called a dozen times, but I never could see Glorious\nJohn.  Twenty years after, by the greatest chance in the world, I saw\nGlorious John, and sure enough Glorious John published my books, but they\nwere different books from the first; I never offered my ballads or Ab\nGwilym to Glorious John.  Glorious John was no snuff-taker.  He asked me\nto dinner, and treated me with superb Rhenish wine.  Glorious John is now\ngone to his rest, but I--what was I going to say?--the world will never\nforget Glorious John.\n\nSo I returned to my last resource for the time then being--to the\npublisher, persevering doggedly in my labour.  One day, on visiting the\npublisher, I found him stamping with fury upon certain fragments of\npaper.  'Sir,' said he, 'you know nothing of German; I have shown your\ntranslation of the first chapter of my Philosophy to several Germans: it\nis utterly unintelligible to them.'  'Did they see the Philosophy?' I\nreplied.  'They did, sir, but they did not profess to understand\nEnglish.'  'No more do I,'  I replied, 'if that Philosophy be English.'\n\nThe publisher was furious--I was silent.  For want of a pinch of snuff, I\nhad recourse to something which is no bad substitute for a pinch of\nsnuff, to those who can't take it, silent contempt; at first it made the\npublisher more furious, as perhaps a pinch of snuff would; it, however,\neventually calmed him, and he ordered me back to my occupations, in other\nwords, the compilation.  To be brief, the compilation was completed, I\ngot paid in the usual manner, and forthwith left him.\n\nHe was a clever man, but what a difference in clever men!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\n\nThe old spot--A long history--Thou shalt not steal--No\nharm--Education--Necessity--Foam on your lip--Apples and pears--What will\nyou read?--Metaphor--The fur cap--I don't know him.\n\nIt was past midwinter, and I sat on London Bridge, in company with the\nold apple-woman: she had just returned to the other side of the bridge,\nto her place in the booth where I had originally found her.  This she had\ndone after frequent conversations with me; 'she liked the old place\nbest,' she said, which she would never have left but for the terror which\nshe experienced when the boys ran away with her book.  So I sat with her\nat the old spot, one afternoon past midwinter, reading the book, of which\nI had by this time come to the last pages.  I had observed that the old\nwoman for some time past had shown much less anxiety about the book than\nshe had been in the habit of doing.  I was, however, not quite prepared\nfor her offering to make me a present of it, which she did that\nafternoon; when, having finished it, I returned it to her, with many\nthanks for the pleasure and instruction I had derived from its perusal.\n'You may keep it, dear,' said the old woman, with a sigh; 'you may carry\nit to your lodging, and keep it for your own.'\n\nLooking at the old woman with surprise, I exclaimed, 'Is it possible that\nyou are willing to part with the book which has been your source of\ncomfort so long?'\n\nWhereupon the old woman entered into a long history, from which I\ngathered that the book had become distasteful to her; she hardly ever\nopened it of late, she said, or if she did, it was only to shut it again;\nalso, that other things which she had been fond of, though of a widely\ndifferent kind, were now distasteful to her.  Porter and beef-steaks were\nno longer grateful to her palate, her present diet chiefly consisting of\ntea, and bread and butter.\n\n'Ah,' said I, 'you have been ill, and when people are ill, they seldom\nlike the things which give them pleasure when they are in health.'  I\nlearned, moreover, that she slept little at night, and had all kinds of\nstrange thoughts; that as she lay awake many things connected with her\nyouth, which she had quite forgotten, came into her mind.  There were\ncertain words that came into her mind the night before the last, which\nwere continually humming in her ears: I found that the words were, 'Thou\nshalt not steal.'\n\nOn inquiring where she had first heard these words, I learned that she\nhad read them at school, in a book called the primer; to this school she\nhad been sent by her mother, who was a poor widow, and followed the trade\nof apple-selling in the very spot where her daughter followed it now.  It\nseems that the mother was a very good kind of woman, but quite ignorant\nof letters, the benefit of which she was willing to procure for her\nchild; and at the school the daughter learned to read, and subsequently\nexperienced the pleasure and benefit of letters, in being able to read\nthe book which she found in an obscure closet of her mother's house, and\nwhich had been her principal companion and comfort for many years of her\nlife.\n\nBut, as I have said before, she was now dissatisfied with the book, and\nwith most other things in which she had taken pleasure; she dwelt much on\nthe words, 'Thou shalt not steal'; she had never stolen things herself,\nbut then she had bought things which other people had stolen, and which\nshe knew had been stolen; and her dear son had been a thief, which he\nperhaps would not have been but for the example which she set him in\nbuying things from characters, as she called them, who associated with\nher.\n\nOn inquiring how she had become acquainted with these characters, I\nlearned that times had gone hard with her; that she had married, but her\nhusband had died after a long sickness, which had reduced them to great\ndistress; that her fruit trade was not a profitable one, and that she had\nbought and sold things which had been stolen to support herself and her\nson.  That for a long time she supposed there was no harm in doing so, as\nher book was full of entertaining tales of stealing; but she now thought\nthat the book was a bad book, and that learning to read was a bad thing;\nher mother had never been able to read, but had died in peace, though\npoor.\n\nSo here was a woman who attributed the vices and follies of her life to\nbeing able to read; her mother, she said, who could not read, lived\nrespectably, and died in peace; and what was the essential difference\nbetween the mother and daughter, save that the latter could read?  But\nfor her literature she might in all probability have lived respectably\nand honestly, like her mother, and might eventually have died in peace,\nwhich at present she could scarcely hope to do.  Education had failed to\nproduce any good in this poor woman; on the contrary, there could be\nlittle doubt that she had been injured by it.  Then was education a bad\nthing?  Rousseau was of opinion that it was; but Rousseau was a\nFrenchman, at least wrote in French, and I cared not the snap of my\nfingers for Rousseau.  But education has certainly been of benefit in\nsome instances; well, what did that prove, but that partiality existed in\nthe management of the affairs of the world--if education was a benefit to\nsome, why was it not a benefit to others?  Could some avoid abusing it,\nany more than others could avoid turning it to a profitable account?  I\ndid not see how they could; this poor simple woman found a book in her\nmother's closet; a book, which was a capital book for those who could\nturn it to the account for which it was intended; a book, from the\nperusal of which I felt myself wiser and better, but which was by no\nmeans suited to the intellect of this poor simple woman, who thought that\nit was written in praise of thieving; yet she found it, she read it,\nand--and--I felt myself getting into a maze; what is right, thought I?\nwhat is wrong?  Do I exist?  Does the world exist? if it does, every\naction is bound up with necessity.\n\n'Necessity!' I exclaimed, and cracked my finger-joints.\n\n'Ah, it is a bad thing,' said the old woman.\n\n'What is a bad thing?' said I.\n\n'Why to be poor, dear.'\n\n'You talk like a fool,' said I, 'riches and poverty are only different\nforms of necessity.'\n\n'You should not call me a fool, dear; you should not call your own mother\na fool.'\n\n'You are not my mother,' said I.\n\n'Not your mother, dear?--no, no more I am; but your calling me fool put\nme in mind of my dear son, who often used to call me fool--and you just\nnow looked as he sometimes did, with a blob of foam on your lip.'\n\n'After all, I don't know that you are not my mother.'\n\n'Don't you, dear?  I'm glad of it; I wish you would make it out.'\n\n'How should I make it out? who can speak from his own knowledge as to the\ncircumstances of his birth?  Besides, before attempting to establish our\nrelationship, it would be necessary to prove that such people exist.'\n\n'What people, dear?'\n\n'You and I.'\n\n'Lord, child, you are mad; that book has made you so.'\n\n'Don't abuse it,' said I; 'the book is an excellent one, that is,\nprovided it exists.'\n\n'I wish it did not,' said the old woman; 'but it shan't long; I'll burn\nit, or fling it into the river--the voices at night tell me to do so.'\n\n'Tell the voices,' said I, 'that they talk nonsense; the book, if it\nexists, is a good book, it contains a deep moral; have you read it all?'\n\n'All the funny parts, dear; all about taking things, and the manner it\nwas done; as for the rest, I could not exactly make it out.'\n\n'Then the book is not to blame; I repeat that the book is a good book,\nand contains deep morality, always supposing that there is such a thing\nas morality, which is the same thing as supposing that there is anything\nat all.'\n\n'Anything at all!  Why ain't we here on this bridge, in my booth, with my\nstall and my--'\n\n'Apples and pears, baked hot, you would say--I don't know; all is a\nmystery, a deep question.  It is a question, and probably always will be,\nwhether there is a world, and consequently apples and pears; and,\nprovided there be a world, whether that world be like an apple or a\npear.'\n\n'Don't talk so, dear.'\n\n'I won't; we will suppose that we all exist--world, ourselves, apples,\nand pears: so you wish to get rid of the book?'\n\n'Yes, dear, I wish you would take it.'\n\n'I have read it, and have no farther use for it; I do not need books: in\na little time, perhaps, I shall not have a place wherein to deposit\nmyself, far less books.'\n\n'Then I will fling it into the river.'\n\n'Don't do that; here, give it me.  Now what shall I do with it? you were\nso fond of it.'\n\n'I am so no longer.'\n\n'But how will you pass your time; what will you read?'\n\n'I wish I had never learned to read, or, if I had, that I had only read\nthe books I saw at school: the primer or the other.'\n\n'What was the other?'\n\n'I think they called it the Bible: all about God, and Job, and Jesus.'\n\n'Ah, I know it.'\n\n'You have read it; is it a nice book--all true?'\n\n'True, true--I don't know what to say; but if the world be true, and not\nall a lie, a fiction, I don't see why the Bible, as they call it, should\nnot be true.  By the bye, what do you call Bible in your tongue, or,\nindeed, book of any kind? as Bible merely means a book.'\n\n'What do I call the Bible in my language, dear?'\n\n'Yes, the language of those who bring you things.'\n\n'The language of those who _did_, dear; they bring them now no longer.\nThey call me fool, as you did, dear, just now; they call kissing the\nBible, which means taking a false oath, smacking calf-skin.'\n\n'That's metaphor,' said I; 'English, but metaphorical; what an odd\nlanguage!  So you would like to have a Bible,--shall I buy you one?'\n\n'I am poor, dear--no money since I left off the other trade.'\n\n'Well, then, I'll buy you one.'\n\n'No, dear, no; you are poor, and may soon want the money; but if you can\ntake me one conveniently on the sly, you know--I think you may, for, as\nit is a good book, I suppose there can be no harm in taking it.'\n\n'That will never do,' said I, 'more especially as I should be sure to be\ncaught, not having made taking of things my trade; but I'll tell you what\nI'll do--try and exchange this book of yours for a Bible; who knows for\nwhat great things this same book of yours may serve?'\n\n'Well, dear,' said the old woman, 'do as you please; I should like to see\nthe--what do you call it?--Bible, and to read it, as you seem to think it\ntrue.'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'seem; that is the way to express yourself in this maze of\ndoubt--I seem to think--these apples and pears seem to be--and here seems\nto be a gentleman who wants to purchase either one or the other.'\n\nA person had stopped before the apple-woman's stall, and was glancing now\nat the fruit, now at the old woman and myself; he wore a blue mantle, and\nhad a kind of fur cap on his head; he was somewhat above the middle\nstature; his features were keen, but rather hard; there was a slight\nobliquity in his vision.  Selecting a small apple, he gave the old woman\na penny; then, after looking at me scrutinisingly for a moment, he moved\nfrom the booth in the direction of Southwark.\n\n'Do you know who that man is?' said I to the old woman.\n\n'No,' said she, 'except that he is one of my best customers: he\nfrequently stops, takes an apple, and gives me a penny; his is the only\npiece of money I have taken this blessed day.  I don't know him, but he\nhas once or twice sat down in the booth with two strange-looking\nmen--Mulattos, or Lascars, I think they call them.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\n\nBought and exchanged--Quite empty--A new firm--Bibles--Countenance of a\nlion--Clap of thunder--A truce with this--I have lost it--Clearly a\nright--Goddess of the Mint.\n\nIn pursuance of my promise to the old woman, I set about procuring her a\nBible with all convenient speed, placing the book which she had intrusted\nto me for the purpose of exchange in my pocket.  I went to several shops,\nand asked if Bibles were to be had: I found that there were plenty.  When,\nhowever, I informed the people that I came to barter, they looked blank,\nand declined treating with me; saying that they did not do business in\nthat way.  At last I went into a shop over the window of which I saw\nwritten, 'Books bought and exchanged': there was a smartish young fellow\nin the shop, with black hair and whiskers; 'You exchange?' said I.  'Yes,'\nsaid he, 'sometimes, but we prefer selling; what book do you want?'  'A\nBible,' said I.  'Ah,' said he, 'there's a great demand for Bibles just\nnow; all kinds of people are become very pious of late,' he added,\ngrinning at me; 'I am afraid I can't do business with you, more\nespecially as the master is not at home.  What book have you brought?'\nTaking the book out of my pocket, I placed it on the counter: the young\nfellow opened the book, and inspecting the title-page, burst into a loud\nlaugh.  'What do you laugh for?' said I, angrily, and half clenching my\nfist.  'Laugh!' said the young fellow; 'laugh! who could help laughing?'\n'I could,' said I; 'I see nothing to laugh at; I want to exchange this\nbook for a Bible.'  'You do?' said the young fellow; 'well, I daresay\nthere are plenty who would be willing to exchange, that is, if they\ndared.  I wish master were at home; but that would never do, either.\nMaster's a family man, the Bibles are not mine, and master being a family\nman, is sharp, and knows all his stock; I'd buy it of you, but, to tell\nyou the truth, I am quite empty here,' said he, pointing to his pocket,\n'so I am afraid we can't deal.'\n\nWhereupon, looking anxiously at the young man, 'What am I to do?' said I;\n'I really want a Bible.'\n\n'Can't you buy one?' said the young man; 'have you no money?'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'I have some, but I am merely the agent of another; I came\nto exchange, not to buy; what am I to do?'\n\n'I don't know,' said the young man, thoughtfully laying down the book on\nthe counter; 'I don't know what you can do; I think you will find some\ndifficulty in this bartering job, the trade are rather precise.'  All at\nonce he laughed louder than before; suddenly stopping, however, he put on\na very grave look.  'Take my advice,' said he; 'there is a firm\nestablished in this neighbourhood which scarcely sells any books but\nBibles; they are very rich, and pride themselves on selling their books\nat the lowest possible price; apply to them, who knows but what they will\nexchange with you?'\n\nThereupon I demanded with some eagerness of the young man the direction\nto the place where he thought it possible that I might effect the\nexchange--which direction the young fellow cheerfully gave me, and, as I\nturned away, had the civility to wish me success.\n\nI had no difficulty in finding the house to which the young fellow\ndirected me; it was a very large house, situated in a square; and upon\nthe side of the house was written in large letters, 'Bibles, and other\nreligious books.'\n\nAt the door of the house were two or three tumbrils, in the act of being\nloaded with chests, very much resembling tea-chests; one of the chests\nfalling down, burst, and out flew, not tea, but various books, in a neat,\nsmall size, and in neat leather covers; Bibles, said I,--Bibles,\ndoubtless.  I was not quite right, nor quite wrong; picking up one of the\nbooks, I looked at it for a moment, and found it to be the New Testament.\n'Come, young lad,' said a man who stood by, in the dress of a porter,\n'put that book down, it is none of yours; if you want a book, go in and\ndeal for one.'\n\nDeal, thought I, deal,--the man seems to know what I am coming about,--and\ngoing in, I presently found myself in a very large room.  Behind a\ncounter two men stood with their backs to a splendid fire, warming\nthemselves, for the weather was cold.\n\nOf these men one was dressed in brown, and the other was dressed in\nblack; both were tall men--he who was dressed in brown was thin, and had\na particularly ill-natured countenance; the man dressed in black was\nbulky, his features were noble, but they were those of a lion.\n\n'What is your business, young man?' said the precise personage, as I\nstood staring at him and his companion.\n\n'I want a Bible,' said I.\n\n'What price, what size?' said the precise-looking man.\n\n'As to size,' said I, 'I should like to have a large one--that is, if you\ncan afford me one--I do not come to buy.'\n\n'Oh, friend,' said the precise-looking man, 'if you come here expecting\nto have a Bible for nothing, you are mistaken--we--'\n\n'I would scorn to have a Bible for nothing,' said I, 'or anything else; I\ncame not to beg, but to barter; there is no shame in that, especially in\na country like this, where all folks barter.'\n\n'Oh, we don't barter,' said the precise man, 'at least Bibles; you had\nbetter depart.'\n\n'Stay, brother,' said the man with the countenance of a lion, 'let us ask\na few questions; this may be a very important case; perhaps the young man\nhas had convictions.'\n\n'Not I,' I exclaimed, 'I am convinced of nothing, and with regard to the\nBible--I don't believe--'\n\n'Hey!' said the man with the lion countenance, and there he stopped.  But\nwith that 'Hey' the walls of the house seemed to shake, the windows\nrattled, and the porter whom I had seen in front of the house came\nrunning up the steps, and looked into the apartment through the glass of\nthe door.\n\nThere was silence for about a minute--the same kind of silence which\nsucceeds a clap of thunder.\n\nAt last the man with the lion countenance, who had kept his eyes fixed\nupon me, said calmly, 'Were you about to say that you don't believe in\nthe Bible, young man?'\n\n'No more than in anything else,' said I; 'you were talking of\nconvictions--I have no convictions.  It is not easy to believe in the\nBible till one is convinced that there is a Bible.'\n\n'He seems to be insane,' said the prim-looking man; 'we had better order\nthe porter to turn him out.'\n\n'I am by no means certain,' said I, 'that the porter could turn me out;\nalways provided there is a porter, and this system of ours be not a lie,\nand a dream.'\n\n'Come,' said the lion-looking man, impatiently, 'a truce with this\nnonsense.  If the porter cannot turn you out, perhaps some other person\ncan; but to the point--you want a Bible?'\n\n'I do,' said I, 'but not for myself; I was sent by another person to\noffer something in exchange for one.'\n\n'And who is that person?'\n\n'A poor old woman, who has had what you call convictions,--heard voices,\nor thought she heard them--I forgot to ask her whether they were loud\nones.'\n\n'What has she sent to offer in exchange?' said the man, without taking\nany notice of the concluding part of my speech.\n\n'A book,' said I.\n\n'Let me see it.'\n\n'Nay, brother,' said the precise man, 'this will never do; if we once\nadopt the system of barter, we shall have all the holders of useless\nrubbish in the town applying to us.'\n\n'I wish to see what he has brought,' said the other; 'perhaps Baxter, or\nJewell's _Apology_, either of which would make a valuable addition to our\ncollection.  Well, young man, what's the matter with you?'\n\nI stood like one petrified; I had put my hand into my pocket--the book\nwas gone.\n\n'What's the matter?' repeated the man with the lion countenance, in a\nvoice very much resembling thunder.\n\n'I have it not--I have lost it!'\n\n'A pretty story, truly,' said the precise-looking man, 'lost it!  You had\nbetter retire,' said the other.\n\n'How shall I appear before the party who intrusted me with the book?  She\nwill certainly think that I have purloined it, notwithstanding all I can\nsay; nor, indeed, can I blame her,--appearances are certainly against\nme.'\n\n'They are so--you had better retire.'\n\nI moved towards the door.  'Stay, young man, one word more; there is only\none way of proceeding which would induce me to believe that you are\nsincere.'\n\n'What is that?' said I, stopping and looking at him anxiously.\n\n'The purchase of a Bible.'\n\n'Purchase!' said I, 'purchase!  I came not to purchase, but to barter;\nsuch was my instruction, and how can I barter if I have lost the book?'\n\nThe other made no answer, and turning away I made for the door; all of a\nsudden I started, and turning round, 'Dear me,' said I, 'it has just come\ninto my head, that if the book was lost by my negligence, as it must have\nbeen, I have clearly a right to make it good.'\n\nNo answer.\n\n'Yes,' I repeated, 'I have clearly a right to make it good; how glad I\nam! see the effect of a little reflection.  I will purchase a Bible\ninstantly, that is, if I have not lost--' and with considerable agitation\nI felt in my pocket.\n\nThe prim-looking man smiled: 'I suppose,' said he, 'that he has lost his\nmoney as well as book.'\n\n'No,' said I, 'I have not'; and pulling out my hand I displayed no less a\nsum than three half-crowns.\n\n'Oh, noble goddess of the Mint!' as Dame Charlotta Nordenflycht, the\nSwede, said a hundred and fifty years ago, 'great is thy power; how\nenergetically the possession of thee speaks in favour of man's\ncharacter!'\n\n'Only half-a-crown for this Bible?' said I, putting down the money, 'it\nis worth three'; and bowing to the man of the noble features, I departed\nwith my purchase.\n\n'Queer customer,' said the prim-looking man, as I was about to close the\ndoor--'don't like him.'\n\n'Why, as to that, I scarcely know what to say,' said he of the\ncountenance of a lion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\n\nThe pickpocket--Strange rencounter--Drag him along--A great\nservice--Things of importance--Philological matters--Mother of\nlanguages--Zhats!\n\nA few days after the occurrence of what is recorded in the last chapter,\nas I was wandering in the City, chance directed my footsteps to an alley\nleading from one narrow street to another in the neighbourhood of\nCheapside.  Just before I reached the mouth of the alley, a man in a\ngreatcoat, closely followed by another, passed it; and, at the moment in\nwhich they were passing, I observed the man behind snatch something from\nthe pocket of the other; whereupon, darting into the street, I seized the\nhindermost man by the collar, crying at the same time to the other, 'My\ngood friend, this person has just picked your pocket.'\n\nThe individual whom I addressed, turning round with a start, glanced at\nme, and then at the person whom I held.  London is the place for strange\nrencounters.  It appeared to me that I recognised both individuals--the\nman whose pocket had been picked and the other; the latter now began to\nstruggle violently; 'I have picked no one's pocket,' said he.  'Rascal,'\nsaid the other, 'you have got my pocket-book in your bosom.'  'No, I have\nnot,' said the other; and, struggling more violently than before, the\npocket-book dropped from his bosom upon the ground.\n\nThe other was now about to lay hands upon the fellow, who was still\nstruggling.  'You had better take up your book,' said I; 'I can hold\nhim.'  He followed my advice; and, taking up his pocket-book, surveyed my\nprisoner with a ferocious look, occasionally glaring at me.  Yes, I had\nseen him before--it was the stranger whom I had observed on London\nBridge, by the stall of the old apple-woman, with the cap and cloak; but,\ninstead of these, he now wore a hat and greatcoat.  'Well,' said I, at\nlast, 'what am I to do with this gentleman of ours?' nodding to the\nprisoner, who had now left off struggling.  'Shall I let him go?'\n\n'Go!' said the other; 'go!  The knave--the rascal; let him go, indeed!\nNot so, he shall go before the Lord Mayor.  Bring him along.'\n\n'Oh, let me go,' said the other: 'let me go; this is the first offence, I\nassure ye--the first time I ever thought to do anything wrong.'\n\n'Hold your tongue,' said I, 'or I shall be angry with you.  If I am not\nvery much mistaken, you once attempted to cheat me.'\n\n'I never saw you before in all my life,' said the fellow, though his\ncountenance seemed to belie his words.\n\n'That is not true,' said I; 'you are the man who attempted to cheat me of\none-and-ninepence in the coach-yard, on the first morning of my arrival\nin London.'\n\n'I don't doubt it,' said the other; 'a confirmed thief'; and here his\ntones became peculiarly sharp; 'I would fain see him hanged--crucified.\nDrag him along.'\n\n'I am no constable,' said I; 'you have got your pocket-book,--I would\nrather you would bid me let him go.'\n\n'Bid you let him go!' said the other almost furiously, 'I command--stay,\nwhat was I going to say?  I was forgetting myself,' he observed more\ngently; 'but he stole my pocket-book;--if you did but know what it\ncontained.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'if it contains anything valuable, be the more thankful\nthat you have recovered it; as for the man, I will help you to take him\nwhere you please; but I wish you would let him go.'\n\nThe stranger hesitated, and there was an extraordinary play of emotion in\nhis features: he looked ferociously at the pickpocket, and, more than\nonce, somewhat suspiciously at myself; at last his countenance cleared,\nand, with a good grace, he said, 'Well, you have done me a great service,\nand you have my consent to let him go; but the rascal shall not escape\nwith impunity,' he exclaimed suddenly, as I let the man go, and starting\nforward, before the fellow could escape, he struck him a violent blow on\nthe face.  The man staggered, and had nearly fallen; recovering himself,\nhowever, he said, 'I tell you what, my fellow; if I ever meet you in this\nstreet in a dark night, and I have a knife about me, it shall be the\nworse for you; as for you, young man,' said he to me; but, observing that\nthe other was making towards him, he left whatever he was about to say\nunfinished, and, taking to his heels, was out of sight in a moment.\n\nThe stranger and myself walked in the direction of Cheapside, the way in\nwhich he had been originally proceeding; he was silent for a few moments,\nat length he said, 'You have really done me a great service, and I should\nbe ungrateful not to acknowledge it.  I am a merchant; and a merchant's\npocket-book, as you perhaps know, contains many things of importance;\nbut, young man,' he exclaimed, 'I think I have seen you before; I thought\nso at first, but where I cannot exactly say: where was it?'  I mentioned\nLondon Bridge and the old apple-woman.  'Oh,' said he, and smiled, and\nthere was something peculiar in his smile, 'I remember now.  Do you\nfrequently sit on London Bridge?'  'Occasionally,' said I; 'that old\nwoman is an old friend of mine.'  'Friend?' said the stranger, 'I am glad\nof it, for I shall know where to find you.  At present I am going to\n'Change; time, you know, is precious to a merchant.'  We were by this\ntime close to Cheapside.  'Farewell,' said he, 'I shall not forget this\nservice.  I trust we shall soon meet again.'  He then shook me by the\nhand and went his way.\n\nThe next day, as I was seated beside the old woman in the booth, the\nstranger again made his appearance, and, after a word or two, sat down\nbeside me; the old woman was sometimes reading the Bible, which she had\nalready had two or three days in her possession, and sometimes\ndiscoursing with me.  Our discourse rolled chiefly on philological\nmatters.\n\n'What do you call bread in your language?' said I.\n\n'You mean the language of those who bring me things to buy, or who did;\nfor, as I told you before, I shan't buy any more; it's no language of\nmine, dear--they call bread pannam in their language.'\n\n'Pannam!' said I, 'pannam! evidently connected with, if not derived from,\nthe Latin panis; even as the word tanner, which signifieth a sixpence, is\nconnected with, if not derived from, the Latin tener, which is itself\nconnected with, if not derived from, tawno or tawner, which, in the\nlanguage of Mr. Petulengro, signifieth a sucking child.  Let me see, what\nis the term for bread in the language of Mr. Petulengro?  Morro, or\nmanro, as I have sometimes heard it called; is there not some connection\nbetween these words and panis?  Yes, I think there is; and I should not\nwonder if morro, manro, and panis were connected, perhaps derived from,\nthe same root; but what is that root?  I don't know--I wish I did;\nthough, perhaps, I should not be the happier.  Morro--manro!  I rather\nthink morro is the oldest form; it is easier to say morro than manro.\nMorro!  Irish, aran; Welsh, bara; English, bread.  I can see a\nresemblance between all the words, and pannam too; and I rather think\nthat the Petulengrian word is the elder.  How odd it would be if the\nlanguage of Mr. Petulengro should eventually turn out to be the mother of\nall the languages in the world; yet it is certain that there are some\nlanguages in which the terms for bread have no connection with the word\nused by Mr. Petulengro, notwithstanding that those languages, in many\nother points, exhibit a close affinity to the language of the horse-shoe\nmaster: for example, bread, in Hebrew, is Laham, which assuredly exhibits\nlittle similitude to the word used by the aforesaid Petulengro.  In\nArmenian it is--'\n\n'Zhats!' said the stranger, starting up.  'By the Patriarch and the Three\nHoly Churches, this is wonderful!  How came you to know aught of\nArmenian?'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\n\nNew acquaintance--Wired cases--Bread and wine--Armenian colonies--Learning\nwithout money--What a language--The tide--Your foible--Learning of the\nHaiks--Old proverb--Pressing invitation.\n\nJust as I was about to reply to the interrogation of my new-formed\nacquaintance, a man with a dusky countenance, probably one of the\nLascars, or Mulattos, of whom the old woman had spoken, came up and\nwhispered to him, and with this man he presently departed, not however\nbefore he had told me the place of his abode, and requested me to visit\nhim.\n\nAfter the lapse of a few days, I called at the house which he had\nindicated.  It was situated in a dark and narrow street, in the heart of\nthe City, at no great distance from the Bank.  I entered a counting-room,\nin which a solitary clerk, with a foreign look, was writing.  The\nstranger was not at home; returning the next day, however, I met him at\nthe door as he was about to enter; he shook me warmly by the hand.  'I am\nglad to see you,' said he, 'follow me, I was just thinking of you.'  He\nled me through the counting-room, to an apartment up a flight of stairs;\nbefore ascending, however, he looked into the book in which the foreign-\nvisaged clerk was writing, and, seemingly not satisfied with the manner\nin which he was executing his task, he gave him two or three cuffs,\ntelling him at the same time that he deserved crucifixion.\n\nThe apartment above stairs, to which he led me, was large, with three\nwindows, which opened upon the street.  The walls were hung with wired\ncases, apparently containing books.  There was a table and two or three\nchairs; but the principal article of furniture was a long sofa, extending\nfrom the door by which we entered to the farther end of the apartment.\nSeating himself upon the sofa, my new acquaintance motioned to me to sit\nbeside him, and then, looking me full in the face, repeated his former\ninquiry.  'In the name of all that is wonderful, how came you to know\naught of my language?'\n\n'There is nothing wonderful in that,' said I; 'we are at the commencement\nof a philological age, every one studies languages; that is, every one\nwho is fit for nothing else; philology being the last resource of dulness\nand ennui, I have got a little in advance of the throng, by mastering the\nArmenian alphabet; but I foresee the time when every unmarriageable miss,\nand desperate blockhead, will likewise have acquired the letters of\nMesroub, and will know the term for bread, in Armenian, and perhaps that\nfor wine.'\n\n'Kini,' said my companion; and that and the other word put me in mind of\nthe duties of hospitality.  'Will you eat bread and drink wine with me?'\n\n'Willingly,' said I.  Whereupon my companion, unlocking a closet,\nproduced, on a silver salver, a loaf of bread, with a silver-handled\nknife, and wine in a silver flask, with cups of the same metal.  ' I hope\nyou like my fare,' said he, after we had both eaten and drunk.\n\n'I like your bread,' said I, 'for it is stale; I like not your wine, it\nis sweet, and I hate sweet wine.'\n\n'It is wine of Cyprus,' said my entertainer; and, when I found that it\nwas wine of Cyprus, I tasted it again, and the second taste pleased me\nmuch better than the first, notwithstanding that I still thought it\nsomewhat sweet.  'So,' said I, after a pause, looking at my companion,\n'you are an Armenian.'\n\n'Yes,' said he, 'an Armenian born in London, but not less an Armenian on\nthat account.  My father was a native of Ispahan, one of the celebrated\nArmenian colony which was established there shortly after the time of the\ndreadful hunger, which drove the children of Haik in swarms from their\noriginal country, and scattered them over most parts of the eastern and\nwestern world.  In Ispahan he passed the greater portion of his life,\nfollowing mercantile pursuits with considerable success.  Certain\nenemies, however, having accused him to the despot of the place, of using\nseditious language, he was compelled to flee, leaving most of his\nproperty behind.  Travelling in the direction of the west, he came at\nlast to London, where he established himself, and where he eventually\ndied, leaving behind a large property and myself, his only child, the\nfruit of a marriage with an Armenian Englishwoman, who did not survive my\nbirth more than three months.'\n\nThe Armenian then proceeded to tell me that he had carried on the\nbusiness of his father, which seemed to embrace most matters, from buying\nsilks of Lascars, to speculating in the funds, and that he had\nconsiderably increased the property which his father had left him.  He\ncandidly confessed that he was wonderfully fond of gold, and said there\nwas nothing like it for giving a person respectability and consideration\nin the world: to which assertion I made no answer, being not exactly\nprepared to contradict it.\n\nAnd, when he had related to me his history, he expressed a desire to know\nsomething more of myself, whereupon I gave him the outline of my history,\nconcluding with saying, 'I am now a poor author, or rather philologist,\nupon the streets of London, possessed of many tongues, which I find of no\nuse in the world.'\n\n'Learning without money is anything but desirable,' said the Armenian,\n'as it unfits a man for humble occupations.  It is true that it may\noccasionally beget him friends; I confess to you that your understanding\nsomething of my language weighs more with me than the service you\nrendered me in rescuing my pocket-book the other day from the claws of\nthat scoundrel whom I yet hope to see hanged, if not crucified,\nnotwithstanding there were in that pocket-book papers and documents of\nconsiderable value.  Yes, that circumstance makes my heart warm towards\nyou, for I am proud of my language--as I indeed well may be--what a\nlanguage, noble and energetic! quite original, differing from all others\nboth in words and structure.'\n\n'You are mistaken,' said I; 'many languages resemble the Armenian both in\nstructure and words.'\n\n'For example?' said the Armenian.\n\n'For example,' said I, 'the English.'\n\n'The English!' said the Armenian; 'show me one word in which the English\nresembles the Armenian.'\n\n'You walk on London Bridge,' said I.\n\n'Yes,' said the Armenian.\n\n'I saw you look over the balustrade the other morning.'\n\n'True,' said the Armenian.\n\n'Well, what did you see rushing up through the arches with noise and\nfoam?'\n\n'What was it?' said the Armenian.  'What was it?--you don't mean the\n_tide_?'\n\n'Do I not?' said I.\n\n'Well, what has the tide to do with the matter?'\n\n'Much,' said I; 'what is the tide?'\n\n'The ebb and flow of the sea,' said the Armenian.\n\n'The sea itself; what is the Haik word for sea?'\n\nThe Armenian gave a strong gasp; then, nodding his head thrice, 'You are\nright,' said he, 'the English word tide is the Armenian for sea; and now\nI begin to perceive that there are many English words which are Armenian;\nthere is --- and ---; and there again in French, there is --- and ---\nderived from the Armenian.  How strange, how singular--I thank you.  It\nis a proud thing to see that the language of my race has had so much\ninfluence over the languages of the world.'\n\nI saw that all that related to his race was the weak point of the\nArmenian.  I did not flatter the Armenian with respect to his race or\nlanguage.  'An inconsiderable people,' said I, 'shrewd and industrious,\nbut still an inconsiderable people.  A language bold and expressive, and\nof some antiquity, derived, though perhaps not immediately, from some\nmuch older tongue.  I do not think that the Armenian has had any\ninfluence over the formation of the languages of the world, I am not much\nindebted to the Armenian for the solution of any doubts; whereas to the\nlanguage of Mr. Petulengro--'\n\n'I have heard you mention that name before,' said the Armenian; 'who is\nMr. Petulengro?'\n\nAnd then I told the Armenian who Mr. Petulengro was.  The Armenian spoke\ncontemptuously of Mr. Petulengro and his race.  'Don't speak\ncontemptuously of Mr. Petulengro,' said I, 'nor of anything belonging to\nhim.  He is a dark mysterious personage; all connected with him is a\nmystery, especially his language; but I believe that his language is\ndoomed to solve a great philological problem--Mr. Petulengo--'\n\n'You appear agitated,' said the Armenian; 'take another glass of wine;\nyou possess a great deal of philological knowledge, but it appears to me\nthat the language of this Petulengro is your foible: but let us change\nthe subject; I feel much interested in you, and would fain be of service\nto you.  Can you cast accounts?'\n\nI shook my head.\n\n'Keep books?'\n\n'I have an idea that I could write books,' said I; 'but, as to keeping\nthem--' and here again I shook my head.\n\nThe Armenian was silent some time; all at once, glancing at one of the\nwire cases, with which, as I have already said, the walls of the room\nwere hung, he asked me if I was well acquainted with the learning of the\nHaiks.  'The books in these cases,' said he, 'contain the masterpieces of\nHaik learning.'\n\n'No,' said I; 'all I know of the learning of the Haiks is their\ntranslation of the Bible.'\n\n'You have never read Z---?'\n\n'No,' said I, 'I have never read Z---.'\n\n'I have a plan,' said the Armenian; 'I think I can employ you agreeably\nand profitably; I should like to see Z--- in an English dress; you shall\ntranslate Z---  If you can read the Scriptures in Armenian, you can\ntranslate Z---.  He is our Esop, the most acute and clever of all our\nmoral writers--his philosophy--'\n\n'I will have nothing to do with him,' said I.\n\n'Wherefore?' said the Armenian.\n\n'There is an old proverb,' said I, '\"that a burnt child avoids the fire.\"\nI have burnt my hands sufficiently with attempting to translate\nphilosophy, to make me cautious of venturing upon it again'; and then I\ntold the Armenian how I had been persuaded by the publisher to translate\nhis philosophy into German, and what sorry thanks I had received; 'And\nwho knows,' said I, 'but the attempt to translate Armenian philosophy\ninto English might he attended with yet more disagreeable consequences?'\n\nThe Armenian smiled.  'You would find me very different from the\npublisher.'\n\n'In many points I have no doubt I should,' I replied; 'but at the present\nmoment I feel like a bird which has escaped from a cage, and, though\nhungry, feels no disposition to return.  Of what nation is the dark man\nbelow stairs, whom I saw writing at the desk?'\n\n'He is a Moldave,' said the Armenian; 'the dog (and here his eyes\nsparkled) deserves to be crucified, he is continually making mistakes.'\n\nThe Armenian again renewed his proposition about Z---, which I again\nrefused, as I felt but little inclination to place myself beneath the\njurisdiction of a person who was in the habit of cuffing those whom he\nemployed, when they made mistakes.  I presently took my departure; not,\nhowever, before I had received from the Armenian a pressing invitation to\ncall upon him whenever I should feel disposed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\n\nWhat to do--Strong enough--Fame and profit--Alliterative\neuphony--Excellent fellow--Listen to me--A plan--Bagnigge Wells.\n\nAnxious thoughts frequently disturbed me at this time with respect to\nwhat I was to do, and how support myself in the Great City.  My future\nprospects were gloomy enough, and I looked forward and feared; sometimes\nI felt half disposed to accept the offer of the Armenian, and to commence\nforthwith, under his superintendence, the translation of the Haik Esop;\nbut the remembrance of the cuffs which I had seen him bestow upon the\nMoldavian, when glancing over his shoulder into the ledger or whatever it\nwas on which he was employed, immediately drove the inclination from my\nmind.  I could not support the idea of the possibility of his staring\nover my shoulder upon my translation of the Haik Esop, and, dissatisfied\nwith my attempts, treating me as he had treated the Moldavian clerk;\nplacing myself in a position which exposed me to such treatment would\nindeed be plunging into the fire after escaping from the frying-pan.  The\npublisher, insolent and overbearing as he was, whatever he might have\nwished or thought, had never lifted his hand against me, or told me that\nI merited crucifixion.\n\nWhat was I to do? turn porter?  I was strong; but there was something\nbesides strength required to ply the trade of a porter--a mind of a\nparticularly phlegmatic temperament, which I did not possess.  What\nshould I do? enlist as a soldier? I was tall enough; but something\nbesides height is required to make a man play with credit the part of\nsoldier, I mean a private one--a spirit, if spirit it can be called,\nwhich will not only enable a man to submit with patience to insolence and\nabuse, and even to cuffs and kicks, but occasionally to the lash.  I felt\nthat I was not qualified to be a soldier, at least a private one; far\nbetter be a drudge to the most ferocious of publishers, editing Newgate\nlives, and writing in eighteenpenny reviews--better to translate the Haik\nEsop, under the superintendence of ten Armenians, than be a private\nsoldier in the English service; I did not decide rashly--I knew something\nof soldiering.  What should I do?  I thought that I would make a last and\ndesperate attempt to dispose of the ballads and of Ab Gwilym.\n\nI had still an idea that, provided I could persuade any spirited\npublisher to give these translations to the world, I should acquire both\nconsiderable fame and profit; not, perhaps, a world-embracing fame such\nas Byron's; but a fame not to be sneered at, which would last me a\nconsiderable time, and would keep my heart from breaking;--profit, not\nequal to that which Scott had made by his wondrous novels, but which\nwould prevent me from starving, and enable me to achieve some other\nliterary enterprise.  I read and re-read my ballads, and the more I read\nthem the more I was convinced that the public, in the event of their\nbeing published, would freely purchase, and hail them with the merited\napplause.  Were not the deeds and adventures wonderful and\nheart-stirring--from which it is true I could claim no merit, being but\nthe translator; but had I not rendered them into English, with all their\noriginal fire?  Yes, I was confident I had; and I had no doubt that the\npublic would say so.  And then, with respect to Ab Gwilym, had I not done\nas much justice to him as to the Danish ballads; not only rendering\nfaithfully his thoughts, imagery, and phraseology, but even preserving in\nmy translation the alliterative euphony which constitutes one of the most\nremarkable features of Welsh prosody?  Yes, I had accomplished all this;\nand I doubted not that the public would receive my translations from Ab\nGwilym with quite as much eagerness as my version of the Danish ballads.\nBut I found the publishers as intractable as ever, and to this day the\npublic has never had an opportunity of doing justice to the glowing fire\nof my ballad versification, and the alliterative euphony of my imitations\nof Ab Gwilym.\n\nI had not seen Francis Ardry since the day I had seen him taking lessons\nin elocution.  One afternoon as I was seated at my table, my head resting\non my hands, he entered my apartment; sitting down, he inquired of me why\nI had not been to see him.\n\n'I might ask the same question of you,' I replied.  'Wherefore have you\nnot been to see me?'  Whereupon Francis Ardry told me that he had been\nmuch engaged in his oratorical exercises, also in escorting the young\nFrenchwoman about to places of public amusement; he then again questioned\nme as to the reason of my not having been to see him.\n\nI returned an evasive answer.  The truth was, that for some time past my\nappearance, owing to the state of my finances, had been rather shabby;\nand I did not wish to expose a fashionable young man like Francis Ardry,\nwho lived in a fashionable neighbourhood, to the imputation of having a\nshabby acquaintance.  I was aware that Francis Ardry was an excellent\nfellow; but, on that very account, I felt, under existing circumstances,\na delicacy in visiting him.\n\nIt is very possible that he had an inkling of how matters stood, as he\npresently began to talk of my affairs and prospects.  I told him of my\nlate ill success with the booksellers, and inveighed against their\nblindness to their own interest in refusing to publish my translations.\n'The last that I addressed myself to,' said I, 'told me not to trouble\nhim again unless I could bring him a decent novel or a tale.'\n\n'Well,' said Frank, 'and why did you not carry him a decent novel or a\ntale?'\n\n'Because I have neither,' said I; 'and to write them is, I believe, above\nmy capacity.  At present I feel divested of all energy--heartless, and\nalmost hopeless.'\n\n'I see how it is,' said Francis Ardry, 'you have overworked yourself,\nand, worst of all, to no purpose.  Take my advice; cast all care aside,\nand only think of diverting yourself for a month at least.'\n\n'Divert myself!' said I; 'and where am I to find the means?'\n\n'Be that care on my shoulders,' said Francis Ardry.  'Listen to me--my\nuncles have been so delighted with the favourable accounts which they\nhave lately received from T--- of my progress in oratory, that, in the\nwarmth of their hearts, they made me a present yesterday of two hundred\npounds.  This is more money than I want, at least for the present; do me\nthe favour to take half of it as a loan--hear me,' said he, observing\nthat I was about to interrupt him; 'I have a plan in my head--one of the\nprettiest in the world.  The sister of my charmer is just arrived from\nFrance; she cannot speak a word of English; and, as Annette and myself\nare much engaged in our own matters, we cannot pay her the attention\nwhich we should wish, and which she deserves, for she is a truly\nfascinating creature, although somewhat differing from my charmer, having\nblue eyes and flaxen hair; whilst, Annette, on the contrary--But I hope\nyou will shortly see Annette.  Now, my plan is this--Take the money,\ndress yourself fashionably, and conduct Annette's sister to Bagnigge\nWells.'\n\n'And what should we do at Bagnigge Wells?'\n\n'Do!' said Francis Ardry.  'Dance!'\n\n'But,' said I, 'I scarcely know anything of dancing.'\n\n'Then here's an excellent opportunity of improving yourself.  Like most\nFrenchwomen, she dances divinely; however, if you object to Bagnigge\nWells and dancing, go to Brighton, and remain there a month or two, at\nthe end of which time you can return with your mind refreshed and\ninvigorated, and materials, perhaps, for a tale or novel.'\n\n'I never heard a more foolish, plan,' said I, 'or one less likely to\nterminate profitably or satisfactorily.  I thank you, however, for your\noffer, which is, I daresay, well meant.  If I am to escape from my cares\nand troubles, and find my mind refreshed and invigorated, I must adopt\nother means than conducting a French demoiselle to Brighton or Bagnigge\nWells, defraying the expense by borrowing from a friend.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\n\nSingular personage--A large sum--Papa of Rome--We are\nChristians--Degenerate Armenians--Roots of Ararat--Regular features.\n\nThe Armenian!  I frequently saw this individual, availing myself of the\npermission which he had given me to call upon him.  A truly singular\npersonage was he, with his love of amassing money, and his nationality so\nstrong as to be akin to poetry.  Many an Armenian I have subsequently\nknown fond of money-getting, and not destitute of national spirit; but\nnever another, who, in the midst of his schemes of lucre, was at all\ntimes willing to enter into a conversation on the structure of the Haik\nlanguage, or who ever offered me money to render into English the fables\nof Z--- in the hope of astonishing the stock-jobbers of the Exchange with\nthe wisdom of the Haik Esop.\n\nBut he was fond of money, very fond.  Within a little time I had won his\nconfidence to such a degree that he informed me that the grand wish of\nhis heart was to be possessed of two hundred thousand pounds.\n\n'I think you might satisfy yourself with the half,' said I.  'One hundred\nthousand pounds is a large sum.'\n\n'You are mistaken,' said the Armenian, 'a hundred thousand pounds is\nnothing.  My father left me that or more at his death.  No, I shall never\nbe satisfied with less than two.'\n\n'And what will you do with your riches,' said I, 'when you have obtained\nthem?  Will you sit down and muse upon them, or will you deposit them in\na cellar, and go down once a day to stare at them?  I have heard say that\nthe fulfilment of one's wishes is invariably the precursor of extreme\nmisery, and forsooth I can scarcely conceive a more horrible state of\nexistence than to be without a hope or wish.'\n\n'It is bad enough, I daresay,' said the Armenian; 'it will, however, be\ntime enough to think of disposing of the money when I have procured it.  I\nstill fall short by a vast sum of the two hundred thousand pounds.'\n\nI had occasionally much conversation with him on the state and prospects\nof his nation, especially of that part of it which still continued in the\noriginal country of the Haiks--Ararat and its confines, which, it\nappeared, he had frequently visited.  He informed me that since the death\nof the last Haik monarch, which occurred in the eleventh century, Armenia\nhad been governed both temporally and spiritually by certain personages\ncalled patriarchs; their temporal authority, however, was much\ncircumscribed by the Persian and Turk, especially the former, of whom the\nArmenian spoke with much hatred, whilst their spiritual authority had at\nvarious times been considerably undermined by the emissaries of the Papa\nof Rome, as the Armenian called him.\n\n'The Papa of Rome sent his emissaries at an early period amongst us,'\nsaid the Armenian, 'seducing the minds of weak-headed people, persuading\nthem that the hillocks of Rome are higher than the ridges of Ararat; that\nthe Roman Papa has more to say in heaven than the Armenian patriarch, and\nthat puny Latin is a better language than nervous and sonorous Haik.'\n\n'They are both dialects,' said I, 'of the language of Mr. Petulengro, one\nof whose race I believe to have been the original founder of Rome; but,\nwith respect to religion, what are the chief points of your faith? you\nare Christians, I believe.'\n\n'Yes,' said the Armenian, 'we are Christians in our way; we believe in\nGod, the Holy Spirit, and Saviour, though we are not prepared to admit\nthat the last personage is not only himself, but the other two.  We\nbelieve . . .' and then the Armenian told me of several things which the\nHaiks believed or disbelieved.  'But what we find most hard of all to\nbelieve,' said he, 'is that the man of the mole-hills is entitled to our\nallegiance, he not being a Haik, or understanding the Haik language.'\n\n'But, by your own confession,' said I, 'he has introduced a schism in\nyour nation, and has amongst you many that believe in him.'\n\n'It is true,' said the Armenian, I that even on the confines of Ararat\nthere are a great number who consider that mountain to be lower than the\nhillocks of Rome; but the greater number of degenerate Armenians are to\nbe found amongst those who have wandered to the west; most of the Haik\nchurches of the west consider Rome to be higher than Ararat--most of the\nArmenians of this place hold that dogma; I, however, have always stood\nfirm in the contrary opinion.\n\n'Ha! ha!'--here the Armenian laughed in his peculiar manner--'talking of\nthis matter puts me in mind of an adventure which lately befell me, with\none of the emissaries of the Papa of Rome, for the Papa of Rome has at\npresent many emissaries in this country, in order to seduce the people\nfrom their own quiet religion to the savage heresy of Rome; this fellow\ncame to me partly in the hope of converting me, but principally to extort\nmoney for the purpose of furthering the designs of Rome in this country.\nI humoured the fellow at first, keeping him in play for nearly a month,\ndeceiving and laughing at him.  At last he discovered that he could make\nnothing of me, and departed with the scowl of Caiaphas, whilst I cried\nafter him, 'The roots of Ararat are _deeper_ than those of Rome.'\n\nThe Armenian had occasionally reverted to the subject of the translation\nof the Haik Esop, which he had still a lurking desire that I should\nexecute; but I had invariably declined the undertaking, without, however,\nstating my reasons.  On one occasion, when we had been conversing on the\nsubject, the Armenian, who had been observing my countenance for some\ntime with much attention, remarked, 'Perhaps, after all, you are right,\nand you might employ your time to better advantage.  Literature is a fine\nthing, especially Haik literature, but neither that nor any other would\nbe likely to serve as a foundation to a man's fortune: and to make a\nfortune should be the principal aim of every one's life; therefore listen\nto me.  Accept a seat at the desk opposite to my Moldavian clerk, and\nreceive the rudiments of a merchant's education.  You shall be instructed\nin the Armenian way of doing business--I think you would make an\nexcellent merchant.'\n\n'Why do you think so?'\n\n'Because you have something of the Armenian look.'\n\n'I understand you,' said I; 'you mean to say that I squint!'\n\n'Not exactly,' said the Armenian, 'but there is certainly a kind of\nirregularity in your features.  One eye appears to me larger than the\nother--never mind, but rather rejoice; in that irregularity consists your\nstrength.  All people with regular features are fools; it is very hard\nfor them, you'll say, but there is no help: all we can do, who are not in\nsuch a predicament, is to pity those who are.  Well! will you accept my\noffer?  No! you are a singular individual; but I must not forget my own\nconcerns.  I must now go forth, having an appointment by which I hope to\nmake money.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\n\nWish fulfilled--Extraordinary figure--Bueno--Noah--The two faces--I don't\nblame him--Too fond of money--Were I an Armenian.\n\nThe fulfilment of the Armenian's grand wish was nearer at hand than\neither he or I had anticipated.  Partly owing to the success of a bold\nspeculation, in which he had some time previously engaged, and partly\nowing to the bequest of a large sum of money by one of his nation who\ndied at this period in Paris, he found himself in the possession of a\nfortune somewhat exceeding two hundred thousand pounds; this fact he\ncommunicated to me one evening about an hour after the close of 'Change;\nthe hour at which I generally called, and at which I mostly found him at\nhome.\n\n'Well,' said I, 'and what do you intend to do next?'\n\n'I scarcely know,' said the Armenian.  'I was thinking of that when you\ncame in.  I don't see anything that I can do, save going on in my former\ncourse.  After all, I was perhaps too moderate in making the possession\nof two hundred thousand pounds the summit of my ambition; there are many\nindividuals in this town who possess three times that sum, and are not\nyet satisfied.  No, I think I can do no better than pursue the old\ncareer; who knows but I may make the two hundred thousand three or\nfour?--there is already a surplus, which is an encouragement; however, we\nwill consider the matter over a goblet of wine; I have observed of late\nthat you have become partial to my Cyprus.'\n\nAnd it came to pass that, as we were seated over the Cyprus wine, we\nheard a knock at the door.  'Adelante!' cried the Armenian; whereupon the\ndoor opened, and in walked a somewhat extraordinary figure--a man in a\nlong loose tunic of a stuff striped with black and yellow; breeches of\nplush velvet, silk stockings, and shoes with silver buckles.  On his head\nhe wore a high-peaked hat; he was tall, had a hooked nose, and in age was\nabout fifty.\n\n'Welcome, Rabbi Manasseh,' said the Armenian.  'I know your knock--you\nare welcome; sit down.'\n\n'I am welcome,' said Manasseh, sitting down; 'he--he--he! you know my\nknock--I bring you money--_bueno_!'\n\nThere was something very peculiar in the sound of that bueno--I never\nforgot it.\n\nThereupon a conversation ensued between Rabbi Manasseh and the Armenian,\nin a language which I knew to be Spanish, though a peculiar dialect.  It\nrelated to a mercantile transaction.  The Rabbi sighed heavily as he\ndelivered to the other a considerable sum of money.\n\n'It is right,' said the Armenian, handing a receipt.  'It is right; and I\nam quite satisfied.'\n\n'You are satisfied--you have taken money.  _Bueno_, I have nothing to say\nagainst your being satisfied.'\n\n'Come, Rabbi,' said the Armenian, 'do not despond; it may be your turn\nnext to take money; in the meantime, can't you be persuaded to taste my\nCyprus?'\n\n'He--he--he! senor, you know I do not love wine.  I love Noah when he is\nhimself; but, as Janus, I love him not.  But you are merry; _bueno_, you\nhave a right to be so.'\n\n'Excuse me,' said I; 'but does Noah ever appear as Janus?'\n\n'He--he--he!' said the Rabbi, 'he only appeared as Janus once--una vez\nquando estuvo borracho; which means--'\n\n'I understand,' said I; 'when he was . . .' and I drew the side of my\nright hand sharply across my left wrist.\n\n'Are you one of our people?' said the Rabbi.\n\n'No,' said I, 'I am one of the Goyim; but I am only half enlightened.  Why\nshould Noah be Janus when he was in that state?'\n\n'He--he--he! you must know that in Lasan akhades wine is janin.'\n\n'In Armenian, kini,' said I; 'in Welsh, gwin; Latin, vinum; but do you\nthink that Janus and janin are one?'\n\n'Do I think?  Don't the commentators say so?  Does not Master Leo\nAbarbenel say so in his _Dialogues of Divine Love_'?\n\n'But,' said I, 'I always thought that Janus was a god of the ancient\nRomans, who stood in a temple open in time of war, and shut in time of\npeace; he was represented with two faces, which--which--'\n\n'He--he--he!' said the Rabbi, rising from his seat; 'he had two faces,\nhad he?  And what did those two faces typify?  You do not know; no, nor\ndid the Romans who carved him with two faces know why they did so; for\nthey were only half enlightened, like you and the rest of the Goyim.  Yet\nthey were right in carving him with two faces looking from each\nother--they were right, though they knew not why; there was a tradition\namong them that the Janinoso had two faces, but they knew not that one\nwas for the world which was gone and the other for the world before\nhim--for the drowned world and for the present, as Master Leo Abarbenel\nsays in his _Dialogues of Divine Love_.  He--he--he!' continued the\nRabbi, who had by this time advanced to the door, and, turning round,\nwaved the two forefingers of his right hand in our faces; 'the Goyims and\nEpicouraiyim are clever men, they know how to make money better than we\nof Israel.  My good friend there is a clever man, I bring him money, he\nnever brought me any; _bueno_, I do not blame him, he knows much, very\nmuch; but one thing there is my friend does not know, nor any of the\nEpicureans, he does not know the sacred thing--he has never received the\ngift of interpretation which God alone gives to the seed--he has his\ngift, I have mine--he is satisfied, I don't blame him, _bueno_.'\n\nAnd, with this last word in his mouth, he departed.\n\n'Is that man a native of Spain?' I demanded.\n\n'Not a native of Spain,' said the Armenian, 'though he is one of those\nwho call themselves Spanish Jews, and who are to be found scattered\nthroughout Europe, speaking the Spanish language transmitted to them by\ntheir ancestors, who were expelled from Spain in the time of Ferdinand\nand Isabella.'\n\n'The Jews are a singular people,' said I.\n\n'A race of cowards and dastards,' said the Armenian, 'without a home or\ncountry; servants to servants; persecuted and despised by all.'\n\n'And what are the Haiks?' I demanded.\n\n'Very different from the Jews,' replied the Armenian; 'the Haiks have a\nhome--a country, and can occasionally use a good sword; though it is true\nthey are not what they might be.'\n\n'Then it is a shame that they do not become so,' said I; 'but they are\ntoo fond of money.  There is yourself, with two hundred thousand pounds\nin your pocket, craving for more, whilst you might be turning your wealth\nto the service of your country.'\n\n'In what manner?' said the Armenian.\n\n'I have heard you say that the grand oppressor of your country is the\nPersian; why not attempt to free your country from his oppression--you\nhave two hundred thousand pounds, and money is the sinew of war?'\n\n'Would you, then, have me attack the Persian?'\n\n'I scarcely know what to say; fighting is a rough trade, and I am by no\nmeans certain that you are calculated for the scratch.  It is not every\none who has been brought up in the school of Mr. Petulengro and Tawno\nChikno.  All I can say is, that if I were an Armenian, and had two\nhundred thousand pounds to back me, I would attack the Persian.'\n\n'Hem!' said the Armenian.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\n\nThe one half-crown--Merit in patience--Cementer of friendship--Dreadful\nperplexity--The usual guttural--Armenian letters--Much indebted to\nyou--Pure helplessness--Dumb people.\n\nOne morning on getting up I discovered that my whole worldly wealth was\nreduced to one half-crown--throughout that day I walked about in\nconsiderable distress of mind; it was now requisite that I should come to\na speedy decision with respect to what I was to do; I had not many\nalternatives, and, before I had retired to rest on the night of the day\nin question, I had determined that I could do no better than accept the\nfirst proposal of the Armenian, and translate under his superintendence\nthe Haik Esop into English.\n\nI reflected, for I made a virtue of necessity, that, after all, such an\nemployment would be an honest and honourable one; honest, inasmuch as by\nengaging in it I should do harm to nobody; honourable, inasmuch as it was\na literary task, which not every one was capable of executing. it was not\nevery one of the booksellers' writers of London who was competent to\ntranslate the Haik Esop.  I determined to accept the offer of the\nArmenian.\n\nOnce or twice the thought of what I might have to undergo in the\ntranslation from certain peculiarities of the Armenian's temper almost\nunsettled me; but a mechanical diving of my hand into my pocket, and the\nfeeling of the solitary half-crown, confirmed me; after all, this was a\nlife of trial and tribulation, and I had read somewhere or other that\nthere was much merit in patience, so I determined to hold fast in my\nresolution of accepting the offer of the Armenian.\n\nBut all of a sudden I remembered that the Armenian appeared to have\naltered his intentions towards me: he appeared no longer desirous that I\nshould render the Haik Esop into English for the benefit of the stock-\njobbers on Exchange, but rather that I should acquire the rudiments of\ndoing business in the Armenian fashion, and accumulate a fortune, which\nwould enable me to make a figure upon 'Change with the best of the stock-\njobbers.  'Well,' thought I, withdrawing my hand from my pocket, whither\nit had again mechanically dived, 'after all, what would the world, what\nwould this city, be without commerce?  I believe the world, and\nparticularly this city, would cut a very poor figure without commerce;\nand then there is something poetical in the idea of doing business after\nthe Armenian fashion, dealing with dark-faced Lascars and Rabbins of the\nSephardim.  Yes, should the Armenian insist upon it, I will accept a seat\nat the desk, opposite the Moldavian clerk.  I do not like the idea of\ncuffs similar to those the Armenian bestowed upon the Moldavian clerk;\nwhatever merit there may be in patience, I do not think that my\nestimation of the merit of patience would be sufficient to induce me to\nremain quietly sitting under the infliction of cuffs.  I think I should,\nin the event of his cuffing me, knock the Armenian down.  Well, I think I\nhave heard it said somewhere, that a knock-down blow is a great cementer\nof friendship; I think I have heard of two people being better friends\nthan ever after the one had received from the other a knock-down blow.'\n\nThat night I dreamed I had acquired a colossal fortune, some four hundred\nthousand pounds, by the Armenian way of doing business, but suddenly\nawoke in dreadful perplexity as to how I should dispose of it.\n\nAbout nine o'clock next morning I set off to the house of the Armenian; I\nhad never called upon him so early before, and certainly never with a\nheart beating with so much eagerness; but the situation of my affairs had\nbecome very critical, and I thought that I ought to lose no time in\ninforming the Armenian that I was at length perfectly willing either to\ntranslate the Haik Esop under his superintendence, or to accept a seat at\nthe desk opposite to the Moldavian clerk, and acquire the secrets of\nArmenian commerce.  With a quick step I entered the counting-room, where,\nnotwithstanding the earliness of the hour, I found the clerk, busied as\nusual at his desk.\n\nHe had always appeared to me a singular being, this same Moldavian clerk.\nA person of fewer words could scarcely be conceived: provided his master\nwere at home, he would, on my inquiring, nod his head; and, provided he\nwere not, he would invariably reply with the monosyllable No, delivered\nin a strange guttural tone.  On the present occasion, being full of\neagerness and impatience, I was about to pass by him to the apartment\nabove, without my usual inquiry, when he lifted his head from the ledger\nin which he was writing, and, laying down his pen, motioned to me with\nhis forefinger, as if to arrest my progress; whereupon I stopped, and,\nwith a palpitating heart, demanded whether the master of the house was at\nhome.  The Moldavian clerk replied with his usual guttural, and, opening\nhis desk, ensconced his head therein.\n\n'It does not much matter,' said I; 'I suppose I shall find him at home\nafter 'Change; it does not much matter, I can return.'\n\nI was turning away with the intention of leaving the room; at this\nmoment, however, the head of the Moldavian clerk became visible, and I\nobserved a letter in his hand, which he had inserted in the desk at the\nsame time with his head; this he extended towards me, making at the same\ntime a sidelong motion with his head, as much as to say that it contained\nsomething which interested me.\n\nI took the letter, and the Moldavian clerk forthwith resumed his\noccupation.  The back of the letter bore my name, written in Armenian\ncharacters; with a trembling hand I broke the seal, and, unfolding the\nletter, I beheld several lines also written in the letters of Mesroub,\nthe Cadmus of the Armenians.\n\nI stared at the lines, and at first could not make out a syllable of\ntheir meaning; at last, however, by continued staring, I discovered that,\nthough the letters were Armenian, the words were English; in about ten\nminutes I had contrived to decipher the sense of the letter; it ran\nsomewhat in this style:--\n\n   'MY DEAR FRIEND--The words which you uttered in our last conversation\n   have made a profound impression upon me; I have thought them over day\n   and night, and have come to the conclusion that it is my bounden duty\n   to attack the Persians.  When these lines are delivered to you, I\n   shall be on the route to Ararat.  A mercantile speculation will be to\n   the world the ostensible motive of my journey, and it is singular\n   enough that one which offers considerable prospect of advantage has\n   just presented itself on the confines of Persia.  Think not, however,\n   that motives of lucre would have been sufficiently powerful to tempt\n   me to the East at the present moment.  I may speculate, it is true,\n   but I should scarcely have undertaken the journey but for your pungent\n   words inciting me to attack the Persians.  Doubt not that I will\n   attack them on the first opportunity.  I thank you heartily for\n   putting me in mind of my duty.  I have hitherto, to use your own\n   words, been too fond of money-getting, like all my countrymen.  I am\n   much indebted to you; farewell! and may every prosperity await you.'\n\nFor some time after I had deciphered the epistle, I stood as if rooted to\nthe floor.  I felt stunned--my last hope was gone; presently a feeling\narose in my mind--a feeling of self-reproach.  Whom had I to blame but\nmyself for the departure of the Armenian?  Would he have ever thought of\nattacking the Persians had I not put the idea into his head? he had told\nme in his epistle that he was indebted to me for the idea.  But for that,\nhe might at the present moment have been in London, increasing his\nfortune by his usual methods, and I might be commencing under his\nauspices the translation of the Haik Esop, with the promise, no doubt, of\na considerable remuneration for my trouble; or I might be taking a seat\nopposite the Moldavian clerk, and imbibing the first rudiments of doing\nbusiness after the Armenian fashion, with the comfortable hope of\nrealising, in a short time, a fortune of three or four hundred thousand\npounds; but the Armenian was now gone, and farewell to the fine hopes I\nhad founded upon him the day before.  What was I to do?  I looked wildly\naround, till my eyes rested on the Moldavian clerk, who was writing away\nin his ledger with particular vehemence.  Not knowing well what to do or\nto say, I thought I might as well ask the Moldavian clerk when the\nArmenian had departed, and when he thought that he would return.  It is\ntrue it mattered little to me when he departed, seeing that he was gone,\nand it was evident that he would not be back soon; but I knew not what to\ndo, and in pure helplessness thought I might as well ask; so I went up to\nthe Moldavian clerk, and asked him when the Armenian had departed, and\nwhether he had been gone two days or three.  Whereupon the Moldavian\nclerk, looking up from his ledger, made certain signs, which I could by\nno means understand.  I stood astonished, but, presently recovering\nmyself, inquired when he considered it probable that the master would\nreturn, and whether he thought it would be two months or--my tongue\nfaltered--two years; whereupon the Moldavian clerk made more signs than\nbefore, and yet more unintelligible; as I persisted, however, he flung\ndown his pen, and, putting his thumb into his mouth, moved it rapidly,\ncausing the nail to sound against the lower jaw; whereupon I saw that he\nwas dumb, and hurried away, for I had always entertained a horror of dumb\npeople, having once heard my another say, when I was a child, that dumb\npeople were half demoniacs, or little better.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\n\nKind of stupor--Peace of God--Divine hand--Farewell, child--The\nfair--Massive edifice--Battered tars--Lost! lost!--Good-day, gentlemen.\n\nLeaving the house of the Armenian, I strolled about for some time; almost\nmechanically my feet conducted me to London Bridge, to the booth in which\nstood the stall of the old apple-woman; the sound of her voice aroused\nme, as I sat in a kind of stupor on the stone bench beside her; she was\ninquiring what was the matter with me.\n\nAt first, I believe, I answered her very incoherently, for I observed\nalarm beginning to depict itself upon her countenance.  Rousing myself,\nhowever, I in my turn put a few questions to her upon her present\ncondition and prospects.  The old woman's countenance cleared up\ninstantly; she informed me that she had never been more comfortable in\nher life; that her trade, her _honest_ trade--laying an emphasis on the\nword honest--had increased of late wonderfully; that her health was\nbetter, and, above all, that she felt no fear and horror 'here,' laying\nher hand on her breast.\n\nOn my asking her whether she still heard voices in the night, she told me\nthat she frequently did; but that the present were mild voices, sweet\nvoices, encouraging voices, very different from the former ones; that a\nvoice, only the night previous, had cried out about 'the peace of God,'\nin particularly sweet accents; a sentence which she remembered to have\nread in her early youth in the primer, but which she had clean forgotten\ntill the voice the night before brought it to her recollection.\n\nAfter a pause, the old woman said to me, 'I believe, dear, that it is the\nblessed book you brought me which has wrought this goodly change.  How\nglad I am now that I can read; but oh what a difference between the book\nyou brought to me and the one you took away!  I believe the one you\nbrought is written by the finger of God, and the other by--'\n\n'Don't abuse the book,' said I, 'it is an excellent book for those who\ncan understand it; it was not exactly suited to you, and perhaps it had\nbeen better that you had never read it--and yet, who knows?  Peradventure,\nif you had not read that book, you would not have been fitted for the\nperusal of the one which you say is written by the finger of God'; and,\npressing my hand to my head, I fell into a deep fit of musing.  'What,\nafter all,' thought I, 'if there should be more order and system in the\nworking of the moral world than I have thought?  Does there not seem in\nthe present instance to be something like the working of a Divine hand?  I\ncould not conceive why this woman, better educated than her mother,\nshould have been, as she certainly was, a worse character than her\nmother.  Yet perhaps this woman may be better and happier than her mother\never was; perhaps she is so already--perhaps this world is not a wild,\nlying dream, as I have occasionally supposed it to be.'\n\nBut the thought of my own situation did not permit me to abandon myself\nmuch longer to these musings.  I started up.  'Where are you going,\nchild?' said the woman, anxiously.  'I scarcely know,' said I;\n'anywhere.'  'Then stay here, child,' said she; 'I have much to say to\nyou.'  'No,' said I, 'I shall be better moving about'; and I was moving\naway, when it suddenly occurred to me that I might never see this woman\nagain; and turning round I offered her my hand, and bade her good-bye.\n'Farewell, child,' said the old woman, 'and God bless you!'  I then moved\nalong the bridge until I reached the Southwark side, and, still holding\non my course, my mind again became quickly abstracted from all\nsurrounding objects.\n\nAt length I found myself in a street or road, with terraces on either\nside, and seemingly of interminable length, leading, as it would appear,\nto the south-east.  I was walking at a great rate--there were likewise a\ngreat number of people, also walking at a great rate; also carts and\ncarriages driving at a great rate; and all--men, carts, and\ncarriages--going in the selfsame direction, namely to the south-east.  I\nstopped for a moment and deliberated whether or not I should proceed.\nWhat business had I in that direction?  I could not say that I had any\nparticular business in that direction, but what could I do were I to turn\nback? only walk about well-known streets; and, if I must walk, why not\ncontinue in the direction in which I was to see whither the road and its\nterraces led?  I was ere in a _terra incognita_, and an unknown place had\nalways some interest for me; moreover, I had a desire to know whither all\nthis crowd was going, and for what purpose.  I thought they could not be\ngoing far, as crowds seldom go far, especially at such a rate; so I\nwalked on more lustily than before, passing group after group of the\ncrowd, and almost vying in speed with some of the carriages, especially\nthe hackney-coaches; and, by dint of walking at this rate, the terraces\nand houses becoming somewhat less frequent as I advanced, I reached in\nabout three-quarters of an hour a kind of low dingy town, in the\nneighbourhood of the river; the streets were swarming with people, and I\nconcluded, from the number of wild-beast shows, caravans, gingerbread\nstalls, and the like, that a fair was being held.  Now, as I had always\nbeen partial to fairs, I felt glad that I had fallen in with the crowd\nwhich had conducted me to the present one, and, casting away as much as I\nwas able all gloomy thoughts, I did my best to enter into the diversions\nof the fair; staring at the wonderful representations of animals on\ncanvas hung up before the shows of wild beasts, which, by the bye, are\nfrequently found much more worthy of admiration than the real beasts\nthemselves; listening to the jokes of the merry-andrews from the\nplatforms in front of the temporary theatres, or admiring the splendid\ntinsel dresses of the performers who thronged the stages in the intervals\nof the entertainments; and in this manner, occasionally gazing and\noccasionally listening, I passed through the town till I came in front of\na large edifice looking full upon the majestic bosom of the Thames.\n\nIt was a massive stone edifice, built in an antique style, and black with\nage, with a broad esplanade between it and the river, on which, mixed\nwith a few people from the fair, I observed moving about a great many\nindividuals in quaint dresses of blue, with strange three-cornered hats\non their heads; most of them were mutilated; this had a wooden leg--this\nwanted an arm; some had but one eye; and as I gazed upon the edifice, and\nthe singular-looking individuals who moved before it, I guessed where I\nwas.  'I am at--' said I; 'these individuals are battered tars of Old\nEngland, and this edifice, once the favourite abode of Glorious\nElizabeth, is the refuge which a grateful country has allotted to them.\nHere they can rest their weary bodies; at their ease talk over the\nactions in which they have been injured; and, with the tear of enthusiasm\nflowing from their eyes, boast how they have trod the deck of fame with\nRodney, or Nelson, or others whose names stand emblazoned in the naval\nannals of their country.'\n\nTurning to the right, I entered a park or wood consisting of enormous\ntrees, occupying the foot, sides, and top of a hill which rose behind the\ntown; there were multitudes of people among the trees, diverting\nthemselves in various ways.  Coming to the top of the hill, I was\npresent' y stopped by a lofty wall, along which I walked, till, coming to\na small gate, I passed through, and found myself on an extensive green\nplain, on one side bounded in part by the wall of the park, and on the\nothers, in the distance, by extensive ranges of houses; to the south-east\nwas a lofty eminence, partially clothed with wood.  The plain exhibited\nan animated scene, a kind of continuation of the fair below; there were\nmultitudes of people upon it, many tents, and shows; there was also horse-\nracing, and much noise and shouting, the sun shining brightly overhead.\nAfter gazing at the horse-racing for a little time, feeling myself\nsomewhat tired, I went up to one of the tents, and laid myself down on\nthe grass.  There was much noise in the tent.  'Who will stand me?' said\na voice with a slight tendency to lisp.  'Will you, my lord?'  'Yes,'\nsaid another voice.  Then there was a sound as of a piece of money\nbanging on a table.  'Lost! lost! lost!' cried several voices; and then\nthe banging down of the money, and the 'lost! lost! lost!' were\nfrequently repeated; at last the second voice exclaimed, 'I will try no\nmore; you have cheated me.'  'Never cheated any one in my life, my\nlord--all fair--all chance.  Them that finds, wins--them that can't\nfinds, loses.  Anyone else try?  Who'll try?  Will you, my lord?' and\nthen it appeared that some other lord tried, for I heard more money flung\ndown.  Then again the cry of 'lost! lost!'--then again the sound of\nmoney, and so on.  Once or twice, but not more, I heard 'Won! won!' but\nthe predominant cry was 'Lost! lost!'  At last there was a considerable\nhubbub, and the words 'Cheat!' 'Rogue!' and 'You filched away the pea!'\nwere used freely by more voices than one, to which the voice with the\ntendency to lisp replied, 'Never filched a pea in my life; would scorn\nit.  Always glad when folks wins; but, as those here don't appear to be\ncivil, not to wish to play any more, I shall take myself off with my\ntable; so, good-day, gentlemen.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\n\nSingular table--No money--Out of employ--My bonnet--We of the\nthimble--Good wages--Wisely resolved--Strangest way in the world--Fat\ngentleman--Not such another--First edition--Not very easy--Won't\nclose--Avella gorgio--Alarmed look.\n\nPresently a man emerged from the tent, bearing before him a rather\nsingular table; it appeared to be of white deal, was exceedingly small at\nthe top, and with very long legs.  At a few yards from the entrance he\npaused, and looked round, as if to decide on the direction which he\nshould take; presently, his eye glancing on me as I lay upon the ground,\nhe started, and appeared for a moment inclined to make off as quick as\npossible, table and all.  In a moment, however, he seemed to recover\nassurance, and, coming up to the place where I was, the long legs of the\ntable projecting before him, he cried, 'Glad to see you here, my lord.'\n\n'Thank you,' said I, 'it's a fine day.'\n\n'Very fine, my lord; will your lordship play?  Them that finds, wins--them\nthat don't finds, loses.'\n\n'Play at what?' said I.\n\n'Only at the thimble and pea, my lord.'\n\n'I never heard of such a game.'\n\n'Didn't you?  Well, I'll soon teach you,' said he, placing the table\ndown.  'All you have to do is to put a sovereign down on my table, and to\nfind the pea, which I put under one of my thimbles.  If you find it,--and\nit is easy enough to find it,--I give you a sovereign besides your own:\nfor them that finds, wins.'\n\n'And them that don't finds, loses,' said I; 'no, I don't wish to play.'\n\n'Why not, my lord?'\n\n'Why, in the first place, I have no money.'\n\n'Oh, you have no money, that of course alters the case.  If you have no\nmoney, you can't play.  Well, I suppose I must be seeing after my\ncustomers,' said he, glancing over the plain.\n\n'Good-day,' said I.\n\n'Good-day,' said the man slowly, but without moving, and as if in\nreflection.  After a moment or two, looking at me inquiringly, he added,\n'Out of employ?'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'out of employ.'\n\nThe man measured me with his eye as I lay on the ground.  At length he\nsaid, 'May I speak a word or two to you, my lord?'\n\n'As many as you please,' said I.\n\n'Then just come a little out of hearing, a little farther on the grass,\nif you please, my lord.'\n\n'Why do you call me my lord?' said I, as I arose and followed him.\n\n'We of the thimble always calls our customers lords,' said the man; 'but\nI won't call you such a foolish name any more; come along.'\n\nThe man walked along the plain till he came to the side of a dry pit,\nwhen, looking round to see that no one was nigh, he laid his table on the\ngrass, and, sitting down with his legs over the side of the pit, he\nmotioned me to do the same.  'So you are in want of employ?' said he,\nafter I had sat down beside him.\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'I am very much in want of employ.'\n\n'I think I can find you some.'\n\n'What kind?' said I.\n\n'Why,' said the man, 'I think you would do to be my bonnet.'\n\n'Bonnet!' said I, 'what is that?'\n\n'Don't you know?  However, no wonder, as you had never heard of the\nthimble and pea game, but I will tell you.  We of the game are very much\nexposed; folks when they have lost their money, as those who play with us\nmostly do, sometimes uses rough language, calls us cheats, and sometimes\nknocks our hats over our eyes; and what's more, with a kick under our\ntable, cause the top deals to fly off; this is the third table I have\nused this day, the other two being broken by uncivil customers: so we of\nthe game generally like to have gentlemen go about with us to take our\npart, and encourage us, though pretending to know nothing about us; for\nexample, when the customer says, \"I'm cheated,\" the bonnet must say, \"No,\nyou ain't, it is all right\"; or, when my hat is knocked over my eyes, the\nbonnet must square, and say, \"I never saw the man before in all my life,\nbut I won't see him ill-used\"; and so, when they kicks at the table, the\nbonnet must say, \"I won't see the table ill-used, such a nice table, too;\nbesides, I want to play myself\"; and then I would say to the bonnet,\n\"Thank you, my lord, them that finds, wins\"; and then the bonnet plays,\nand I lets the bonnet win.'\n\n'In a word,' said I, 'the bonnet means the man who covers you, even as\nthe real bonnet covers the head.'\n\n'I just so,' said the man; 'I see you are awake, and would soon make a\nfirst-rate bonnet.'\n\n'Bonnet,' said I, musingly; 'bonnet; it is metaphorical.'\n\n'Is it?' said the man.\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'like the cant words--'\n\n'Bonnet is cant,' said the man; 'we of the thimble, as well as all cly-\nfakers and the like, understand cant, as, of course, must every bonnet;\nso, if you are employed by me, you had better learn it as soon as you\ncan, that we may discourse together without being understood by every\none.  Besides covering his principal, a bonnet must have his eyes about\nhim, for the trade of the pea, though a strictly honest one, is not\naltogether lawful; so it is the duty of the bonnet, if he sees the\nconstable coming, to say, The gorgio's welling.'\n\n'That is not cant,' said I, 'that is the language of the Rommany Chals.'\n\n'Do you know those people?' said the man.\n\n'Perfectly,' said I, 'and their language too.'\n\n'I wish I did,' said the man; 'I would give ten pounds and more to know\nthe language of the Rommany Chals.  There's some of it in the language of\nthe pea and thimble; how it came there I don't know, but so it is.  I\nwish I knew it, but it is difficult.  You'll make a capital bonnet; shall\nwe close?'\n\n'What would the wages be?' I demanded.\n\n'Why, to a first-rate bonnet, as I think you would prove, I could afford\nto give from forty to fifty shillings a week.'\n\n'Is it possible?' said I.\n\n'Good wages, ain't they?' said the man.\n\n'First-rate,' said I; 'bonneting is more profitable than reviewing.'\n\n'Anan?' said the man.\n\n'Or translating; I don't think the Armenian would have paid me at that\nrate for translating his Esop.'\n\n'Who is he?' said the man.\n\n'Esop?'\n\n'No, I know what that is, Esop's cant for a hunchback; but t'other?'\n\n'You should know,' said I.\n\n'Never saw the man in all my life.'\n\n'Yes, you have,' said I, 'and felt him too; don't you remember the\nindividual from whom you took the pocket-book?'\n\n'Oh, that was he; well, the less said about that matter the better; I\nhave left off that trade, and taken to this, which is a much better.\nBetween ourselves, I am not sorry that I did not carry off that pocket-\nbook; if I had, it might have encouraged me in the trade, in which had I\nremained, I might have been lagged, sent abroad, as I had been already\nimprisoned; so I determined to leave it off at all hazards, though I was\nhard up, not having a penny in the world.'\n\n'And wisely resolved,' said I; 'it was a bad and dangerous trade, I\nwonder you should ever have embraced it.'\n\n'It is all very well talking,' said the man, 'but there is a reason for\neverything; I am the son of a Jewess, by a military officer'--and then\nthe man told me his story.  I shall not repeat the man's story, it was a\npoor one, a vile one; at last he observed, 'So that affair which you know\nof determined me to leave the filching trade, and take up with a more\nhonest and safe one; so at last I thought of the pea and thimble, but I\nwanted funds, especially to pay for lessons at the hands of a master, for\nI knew little about it.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'how did you get over that difficulty?'\n\n'Why,' said the man, 'I thought I should never have got over it.  What\nfunds could I raise?  I had nothing to sell; the few clothes I had I\nwanted, for we of the thimble must always appear decent, or nobody would\ncome near us.  I was at my wits' ends; at last I got over my difficulty\nin the strangest way in the world.'\n\n'What was that?'\n\n'By an old thing which I had picked up some time before--a book.'\n\n'A book?' said I.\n\n'Yes, which I had taken out of your lordship's pocket one day as you were\nwalking the streets in a great hurry.  I thought it was a pocket-book at\nfirst, full of bank-notes, perhaps,' continued he, laughing.  'It was\nwell for me, however, that it was not, for I should have soon spent the\nnotes; as it was, I had flung the old thing down with an oath, as soon as\nI brought it home.  When I was so hard up, however, after the affair with\nthat friend of yours, I took it up one day, and thought I might make\nsomething by it to support myself a day with.  Chance or something else\nled me into a grand shop; there was a man there who seemed to be the\nmaster, talking to a jolly, portly old gentleman, who seemed to be a\ncountry squire.  Well, I went up to the first, and offered it for sale;\nhe took the book, opened it at the title-page, and then all of a sudden\nhis eyes glistened, and he showed it to the fat, jolly gentleman, and his\neyes glistened too, and I heard him say \"How singular!\" and then the two\ntalked together in a speech I didn't understand--I rather thought it was\nFrench, at any rate it wasn't cant; and presently the first asked me what\nI would take for the book.  Now I am not altogether a fool, nor am I\nblind, and I had narrowly marked all that passed, and it came into my\nhead that now was the time for making a man of myself, at any rate I\ncould lose nothing by a little confidence; so I looked the man boldly in\nthe face, and said, \"I will have five guineas for that book, there ain't\nsuch another in the whole world.\"  \"Nonsense,\" said the first man, \"there\nare plenty of them, there have been nearly fifty editions, to my\nknowledge; I will give you five shillings.\"  \"No,\" said I, \"I'll not take\nit, for I don't like to be cheated, so give me my book again\"; and I\nattempted to take it away from the fat gentleman's hand.  \"Stop,\" said\nthe younger man; \"are you sure that you won't take less?\"  \"Not a\nfarthing,\" said I; which was not altogether true, but I said so.  \"Well,\"\nsaid the fat gentleman, \"I will give you what you ask\"; and sure enough\nhe presently gave me the money; so I made a bow, and was leaving the\nshop, when it came into my head that there was something odd in all this,\nand, as I had the money in my pocket, I turned back, and, making another\nbow, said, \"May I be so bold as to ask why you gave me all this money for\nthat 'ere dirty book?  When I came into the shop, I should have been glad\nto get a shilling for it; but I saw you wanted it, and asked five\nguineas.\"  Then they looked at one another, and smiled, and shrugged up\ntheir shoulders.  Then the first man, looking at me, said, \"Friend, you\nhave been a little too sharp for us; however, we can afford to forgive\nyou, as my friend here has long been in quest of this particular book;\nthere are plenty of editions, as I told you, and a common copy is not\nworth five shillings; but this is a first edition, and a copy of the\nfirst edition is worth its weight in gold.\"'\n\n'So, after all, they outwitted you,' I observed.\n\n'Clearly,' said the man; 'I might have got double the price, had I known\nthe value; but I don't care, much good may it do them, it has done me\nplenty.  By means of it I have got into an honest, respectable trade, in\nwhich there's little danger and plenty of profit, and got out of one\nwhich would have got me lagged, sooner or later.'\n\n'But,' said I, 'you ought to remember that the thing was not yours; you\ntook it from me, who had been requested by a poor old apple-woman to\nexchange it for a Bible.'\n\n'Well,' said the man, 'did she ever get her Bible?'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'she got her Bible.'\n\n'Then she has no cause to complain; and, as for you, chance or something\nelse has sent you to me, that I may make you reasonable amends for any\nloss you may have had.  Here am I ready to make you my bonnet, with forty\nor fifty shillings a week, which you say yourself are capital wages.'\n\n'I find no fault with the wages,' said I, 'but I don't like the employ.'\n\n'Not like bonneting,' said the man; 'ah, I see, you would like to be\nprincipal; well, a time may come--those long white fingers of yours would\njust serve for the business.'\n\n'Is it a difficult one?' I demanded.\n\n'Why, it is not very easy: two things are needful--natural talent, and\nconstant practice; but I'll show you a point or two connected with the\ngame'; and, placing his table between his knees as he sat over the side\nof the pit, he produced three thimbles, and a small brown pellet,\nsomething resembling a pea.  He moved the thimble and pellet about, now\nplacing it to all appearance under one, and now under another; 'Under\nwhich is it now?' he said at last.  'Under that,' said I, pointing to the\nlowermost of the thimbles, which, as they stood, formed a kind of\ntriangle.  'No,' said he, 'it is not, but lift it up'; and, when I lifted\nup the thimble, the pellet, in truth, was not under it.  'It was under\nnone of them,' said he, 'it was pressed by my little finger against my\npalm'; and then he showed me how he did the trick, and asked me if the\ngame was not a funny one; and, on my answering in the affirmative, he\nsaid, 'I am glad you like it; come along and let us win some money.'\n\nThereupon, getting up, he placed the table before him, and was moving\naway; observing, however, that I did not stir, he asked me what I was\nstaying for.  'Merely for my own pleasure,' said I; 'I like sitting here\nvery well.'  'Then you won't close?' said the man.  'By no means,' I\nreplied; 'your proposal does not suit me.'  'You may be principal in\ntime,' said the man.  'That makes no difference,' said I; and, sitting\nwith my legs over the pit, I forthwith began to decline an Armenian noun.\n'That ain't cant,' said the man; 'no, nor gypsy either.  Well, if you\nwon't close, another will, I can't lose any more time,' and forthwith he\ndeparted.\n\nAnd after I had declined four Armenian nouns, of different declensions, I\nrose from the side of the pit, and wandered about amongst the various\ngroups of people scattered over the green.  Presently I came to where the\nman of the thimbles was standing, with the table before him, and many\npeople about him.  'Them who finds, wins, and them who can't find,\nloses,' he cried.  Various individuals tried to find the pellet, but all\nwere unsuccessful, till at last considerable dissatisfaction was\nexpressed, and the terms rogue and cheat were lavished upon him.  'Never\ncheated anybody in all my life,' he cried; and, observing me at hand,\n'didn't I play fair, my lord?' he inquired.  But I made no answer.\nPresently some more played, and he permitted one or two to win, and the\neagerness to play with him became greater.  After I had looked on for\nsome time, I was moving away: just then I perceived a short, thick\npersonage, with a staff in his hand, advancing in a great hurry;\nwhereupon, with a sudden impulse, I exclaimed--\n\n   Shoon thimble-engro;\n   Avella gorgio.\n\nThe man, who was in the midst of his pea-and-thimble process, no sooner\nheard the last word of the distich than he turned an alarmed look in the\ndirection of where I stood; then, glancing around, and perceiving the\nconstable, he slipped forthwith his pellet and thimbles into his pocket,\nand, lifting up his table, he cried to the people about him, 'Make way!'\nand with a motion with his head to me, as if to follow him, he darted off\nwith a swiftness which the short, pursy constable could by no means\nrival; and whither he went, or what became of him, I know not, inasmuch\nas I turned away in another direction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\n\nMr. Petulengro--Rommany Rye--Lil-writers--One's own horn--Lawfully-earnt\nmoney--The wooded hill--A great favourite--The shop window--Much wanted.\n\nAnd, as I wandered along the green, I drew near to a place where several\nmen, with a cask beside them, sat carousing in the neighbourhood of a\nsmall tent.  'Here he comes,' said one of them, as I advanced, and\nstanding up he raised his voice and sang:--\n\n   'Here the Gypsy gemman see,\n   With his Roman jib and his rome and dree--\n   Rome and dree, rum and dry\n   Rally round the Rommany Rye.'\n\nIt was Mr. Petulengro, who was here diverting himself with several of his\ncomrades; they all received me with considerable frankness.  'Sit down,\nbrother,' said Mr. Petulengro, 'and take a cup of good ale.'\n\nI sat down.  'Your health, gentlemen,' said I, as I took the cup which\nMr. Petulengro handed to me.\n\n'Aukko tu pios adrey Rommanis.  Here is your health in Rommany, brother,'\nsaid Mr. Petulengro; who, having refilled the cup, now emptied it at a\ndraught.\n\n'Your health in Rommany, brother,' said Tawno Chikno, to whom the cup\ncame next.\n\n'The Rommany Rye,' said a third.\n\n'The Gypsy gentleman,' exclaimed a fourth, drinking.\n\nAnd then they all sang in chorus:--\n\n   'Here the Gypsy gemman see,\n   With his Roman jib and his rome and dree--\n   Rome and dree, rum and dry\n   Rally round the Rommany Rye.'\n\n{picture:'Here the Gipsy gemman see.': page304.jpg}\n\n'And now, brother,' said Mr. Petulengro, 'seeing that you have drunk and\nbeen drunken, you will perhaps tell us where you have been, and what\nabout?'\n\n'I have been in the Big City,' said I, 'writing lils.'\n\n'How much money have you got in your pocket, brother?' said Mr.\nPetulengro.\n\n'Eighteenpence,' said I; 'all I have in the world.'\n\n'I have been in the Big City, too,' said Mr. Petulengro; 'but I have not\nwritten lils--I have fought in the ring--I have fifty pounds in my\npocket--I have much more in the world.  Brother, there is considerable\ndifference between us.\n\n'I would rather be the lil-writer, after all,' said the tall, handsome,\nblack man; 'indeed, I would wish for nothing better.'\n\n'Why so?' said Mr. Petulengro.\n\n'Because they have so much to say for themselves,' said the black man,\n'even when dead and gone.  When they are laid in the churchyard, it is\ntheir own fault if people ain't talking of them.  Who will know, after I\nam dead, or bitchadey pawdel, that I was once the beauty of the world, or\nthat you Jasper were--'\n\n'The best man in England of my inches.  That's true, Tawno--however,\nhere's our brother will perhaps let the world know something about us.'\n\n'Not he,' said the other, with a sigh; 'he'll have quite enough to do in\nwriting his own lils, and telling the world how handsome and clever he\nwas; and who can blame him?  Not I.  If I could write lils, every word\nshould be about myself and my own tacho Rommanis--my own lawful wedded\nwife, which is the same thing.  I tell you what, brother, I once heard a\nwise man say in Brummagem, that \"there is nothing like blowing one's own\nhorn,\" which I conceive to be much the same thing as writing one's own\nlil.'\n\nAfter a little more conversation, Mr. Petulengro arose, and motioned me\nto follow him.  'Only eighteenpence in the world, brother?' said he, as\nwe walked together.\n\n'Nothing more, I assure you.  How came you to ask me how much money I\nhad?'\n\n'Because there was something in your look, brother, something very much\nresembling that which a person showeth who does not carry much money in\nhis pocket.  I was looking at my own face this morning in my wife's\nlooking-glass--I did not look as you do, brother.'\n\n'I believe your sole motive for inquiring,' said I, 'was to have an\nopportunity of venting a foolish boast, and to let me know that you were\nin possession of fifty pounds.'\n\n'What is the use of having money unless you let people know you have it?'\nsaid Mr. Petulengro.  'It is not every one can read faces, brother; and,\nunless you knew I had money, how could you ask me to lend you any?'\n\n'I am not going to ask you to lend me any.'\n\n'Then you may have it without asking; as I said before, I have fifty\npounds, all lawfully-earnt money, got by fighting in the ring--I will\nlend you that, brother.'\n\n'You are very kind,' said I; 'but I will not take it.'\n\n'Then the half of it?'\n\n'Nor the half of it; but it is getting towards evening, I must go back to\nthe Great City.'\n\n'And what will you do in the Boro Foros?'\n\n'I know not,' said I.\n\n'Earn money?\n\n'If I can.'\n\n'And if you can't?'\n\n'Starve!'\n\n'You look ill, brother,' said Mr. Petulengro.\n\n'I do not feel well; the Great City does not agree with me.  Should I be\nso fortunate as to earn some money, I would leave the Big City, and take\nto the woods and fields.'\n\n'You may do that, brother,' said Mr. Petulengro, 'whether you have money\nor not.  Our tents and horses are on the other side of yonder wooded\nhill, come and stay with us; we shall all be glad of your company, but\nmore especially myself and my wife Pakomovna.'\n\n'What hill is that?' I demanded.\n\nAnd then Mr. Petulengro told me the name of the hill.  'We shall stay on\nt'other side of the hill a fortnight,' he continued; 'and, as you are\nfond of lil-writing, you may employ yourself profitably whilst there.  You\ncan write the lil of him whose dock gallops down that hill every night,\neven as the living man was wont to do long ago.'\n\n'Who was he?' I demanded.\n\n'Jemmy Abershaw,' said Mr. Petulengro; 'one of those whom we call Boro\ndrom engroes, and the gorgios highway-men.  I once heard a rye say that\nthe life of that man would fetch much money; so come to the other side of\nthe hill, and write the lil in the tent of Jasper and his wife\nPakomovna.'\n\n{picture:'Even as the living man was wont to do long ago.': page307.jpg}\n\nAt first I felt inclined to accept the invitation of Mr. Petulengro; a\nlittle consideration, however, determined me to decline it.  I had always\nbeen on excellent terms with Mr. Petulengro, but I reflected that people\nmight be excellent friends when they met occasionally in the street, or\non the heath, or in the wood; but that these very people when living\ntogether in a house, to say nothing of a tent, might quarrel.  I\nreflected, moreover, that Mr. Petulengro had a wife.  I had always, it is\ntrue, been a great favourite with Mrs. Petulengro, who had frequently\nbeen loud in her commendation of the young rye, as she called me, and his\nturn of conversation; but this was at a time when I stood in need of\nnothing, lived under my parents' roof, and only visited at the tents to\ndivert and to be diverted.  The times were altered, and I was by no means\ncertain that Mrs. Petulengro, when she should discover that I was in need\nboth of shelter and subsistence, might not alter her opinion both with\nrespect to the individual and what he said--stigmatising my conversation\nas saucy discourse, and myself as a scurvy companion; and that she might\nbring over her husband to her own way of thinking, provided, indeed, he\nshould need any conducting.  I therefore, though without declaring my\nreasons, declined the offer of Mr. Petulengro, and presently, after\nshaking him by the hand, bent again my course towards the Great City.\n\nI crossed the river at a bridge considerably above that hight of London;\nfor, not being acquainted with the way, I missed the turning which should\nhave brought me to the latter.  Suddenly I found myself in a street of\nwhich I had some recollection, and mechanically stopped before the window\nof a shop at which various publications were exposed; it was that of the\nbookseller to whom I had last applied in the hope of selling my ballads\nor Ab Gwilym, and who had given me hopes that, in the event of my writing\na decent novel, or a tale, he would prove a purchaser.  As I stood\nlistlessly looking at the window, and the publications which it\ncontained, I observed a paper affixed to the glass by wafers with\nsomething written upon it.  I drew yet nearer for the purpose of\ninspecting it; the writing was in a fair round hand--'A Novel or Tale is\nmuch wanted,' was what was written.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\n\nBread and water--Pair play--Fashion--Colonel B-----Joseph Sell--The\nkindly glow--Easiest manner imaginable.\n\n'I must do something,' said I, as I sat that night in my lonely\napartment, with some bread and a pitcher of water before me.\n\nThereupon taking some of the bread, and eating it, I considered what I\nwas to do.  'I have no idea what I am to do,' said I, as I stretched my\nhand towards the pitcher, 'unless (and here I took a considerable\ndraught) I write a tale or a novel--That bookseller,' I continued,\nspeaking to myself, 'is certainly much in need of a tale or a novel,\notherwise he would not advertise for one.  Suppose I write one, I appear\nto have no other chance of extricating myself from my present\ndifficulties; surely it was Fate that conducted me to his window.\n\n'I will do it,' said I, as I struck my hand against the table; 'I will do\nit.'  Suddenly a heavy cloud of despondency came over me.  Could I do it?\nHad I the imagination requisite to write a tale or a novel?  'Yes, yes,'\nsaid I, as I struck my hand again against the table, 'I can manage it;\ngive me fair play, and I can accomplish anything.'\n\nBut should I have fair play?  I must have something to maintain myself\nwith whilst I wrote my tale, and I had but eighteenpence in the world.\nWould that maintain me whilst I wrote my tale?  Yes, I thought it would,\nprovided I ate bread, which did not cost much, and drank water, which\ncost nothing; it was poor diet, it was true, but better men than myself\nhad written on bread and water; had not the big man told me so? or\nsomething to that effect, months before?\n\nIt was true there was my lodging to pay for; but up to the present time I\nowed nothing, and perhaps, by the time that the people of the house asked\nme for money, I should have written a tale or a novel, which would bring\nme in money; I had paper, pens, and ink, and, let me not forget them, I\nhad candles in my closet, all paid for, to light me during my night work.\nEnough, I would go doggedly to work upon my tale or novel.\n\nBut what was the tale or novel to be about?  Was it to be a tale of\nfashionable life, about Sir Harry Somebody, and the Countess something?\nBut I knew nothing about fashionable people, and cared less; therefore\nhow should I attempt to describe fashionable life? What should the tale\nconsist of?  The life and adventures of some one.  Good--but of whom?  Did\nnot Mr. Petulengro mention one Jemmy Abershaw?  Yes.  Did he not tell me\nthat the life and adventures of Jemmy Abershaw would bring in much money\nto the writer?  Yes, but I knew nothing of that worthy.  I heard, it is\ntrue, from Mr. Petulengro, that when alive he committed robberies on the\nhill, on the side of which Mr. Petulengro had pitched his tents, and that\nhis ghost still haunted the hill at midnight; but those were scant\nmaterials out of which to write the man's life.  It is probable indeed,\nthat Mr. Petulengro would be able to supply me with further materials if\nI should apply to him, but I was in a hurry, and could not afford the\ntime which it would be necessary to spend in passing to and from Mr.\nPetulengro, and consulting him.  Moreover, my pride revolted at the idea\nof being beholden to Mr. Petulengro for the materials of the history.  No,\nI would not write the history of Abershaw.  Whose then--Harry Simms?\nAlas, the life of Harry Simms had been already much better written by\nhimself than I could hope to do it; and, after all, Harry Simms, like\nJemmy Abershaw, was merely a robber.  Both, though bold and extraordinary\nmen, were merely highwaymen.  I questioned whether I could compose a tale\nlikely to excite any particular interest out of the exploits of a mere\nrobber.  I want a character for my hero, thought I, something higher than\na mere robber; some one like--like Colonel B---.  By the way, why should\nI not write the life and adventures of Colonel B---, of Londonderry in\nIreland?\n\nA truly singular man was this same Colonel B---, of Londonderry in\nIreland; a personage of most strange and incredible feats and daring, who\nhad been a partizan soldier, a bravo--who, assisted by certain\ndiscontented troopers, nearly succeeded in stealing the crown and regalia\nfrom the Tower of London; who attempted to hang the Duke of Ormond at\nTyburn; and whose strange, eventful career did not terminate even with\nhis life, his dead body, on the circulation of an unfounded report that\nhe did not come to his death by fair means, having been exhumed by the\nmob of his native place, where he had retired to die, and carried in the\ncoffin through the streets.\n\nOf his life I had inserted an account in the _Newgate Lives and Trials_;\nit was bare and meagre, and written in the stiff, awkward style of the\nseventeenth century; it had, however, strongly captivated my imagination,\nand I now thought that out of it something better could be made; that, if\nI added to the adventures, and purified the style, I might fashion out of\nit a very decent tale or novel.  On a sudden, however, the proverb of\nmending old garments with new cloth occurred to me.  'I am afraid,' said\nI, 'any new adventures which I can invent will not fadge well with the\nold tale; one will but spoil the other.'  I had better have nothing to do\nwith Colonel B---, thought I, but boldly and independently sit down and\nwrite the life of Joseph Sell.\n\nThis Joseph Sell, dear reader, was a fictitious personage who had just\ncome into my head.  I had never even heard of the name, but just at that\nmoment it happened to come into my head; I would write an entirely\nfictitious narrative, called the _Life and Adventures of Joseph Sell_,\nthe great traveller.\n\nI had better begin at once, thought I; and removing the bread and the\njug, which latter was now empty, I seized pen and paper, and forthwith\nessayed to write the life of Joseph Sell, but soon discovered that it is\nmuch easier to resolve upon a thing than to achieve it, or even to\ncommence it; for the life of me I did not know how to begin, and, after\ntrying in vain to write a line, I thought it would be as well to go to\nbed, and defer my projected undertaking till the morrow.\n\nSo I went to bed, but not to sleep.  During the greater part of the night\nI lay awake, musing upon the work which I had determined to execute.  For\na long time my brain was dry and unproductive; I could form no plan which\nappeared feasible.  At length I felt within my brain a kindly glow; it\nwas the commencement of inspiration; in a few minutes I had formed my\nplan; I then began to imagine the scenes and the incidents.  Scenes and\nincidents flitted before my mind's eye so plentifully, that I knew not\nhow to dispose of them; I was in a regular embarrassment.  At length I\ngot out of the difficulty in the easiest manner imaginable, namely, by\nconsigning to the depths of oblivion all the feebler and less stimulant\nscenes and incidents, and retaining the better and more impressive ones.\nBefore morning I had sketched the whole work on the tablets of my mind,\nand then resigned myself to sleep in the pleasing conviction that the\nmost difficult part of my undertaking was achieved.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\n\nConsiderably sobered--Power of writing--The tempter--Hungry talent--Work\nconcluded.\n\nRather late in the morning I awoke; for a few minutes I lay still,\nperfectly still; my imagination was considerably sobered; the scenes and\nsituations which had pleased me so much over night appeared to me in a\nfar less captivating guise that morning.  I felt languid and almost\nhopeless--the thought, however, of my situation soon roused me--I must\nmake an effort to improve the posture of my affairs; there was no time to\nbe lost; so I sprang out of bed, breakfasted on bread and water, and then\nsat down doggedly to write the life of Joseph Sell.\n\nIt was a great thing to have formed my plan, and to have arranged the\nscenes in my head, as I had done on the preceding night.  The chief thing\nrequisite at present was the mere mechanical act of committing them to\npaper.  This I did not find at first so easy as I could wish--I wanted\nmechanical skill; but I persevered, and before evening I had written ten\npages.  I partook of some bread and water; and before I went to bed that\nnight, I had completed fifteen pages of my life of Joseph Sell.\n\nThe next day I resumed my task--I found my power of writing considerably\nincreased; my pen hurried rapidly over the paper--my brain was in a\nwonderfully teeming state; many scenes and visions which I had not\nthought of before were evolved, and, as fast as evolved, written down;\nthey seemed to be more pat to my purpose, and more natural to my history,\nthan many others which I had imagined before, and which I made now give\nplace to these newer creations: by about midnight I had added thirty\nfresh pages to my _Life and Adventures of Joseph Sell_.\n\nThe third day arose--it was dark and dreary out of doors, and I passed it\ndrearily enough within; my brain appeared to have lost much of its former\nglow, and my pen much of its power; I, however, toiled on, but at\nmidnight had only added seven pages to my history of Joseph Sell.\n\nOn the fourth day the sun shone brightly--I arose, and, having\nbreakfasted as usual, I fell to work.  My brain was this day wonderfully\nprolific, and my pen never before or since glided so rapidly over the\npaper; towards night I began to feel strangely about the back part of my\nhead, and my whole system was extraordinarily affected.  I likewise\noccasionally saw double--a tempter now seemed to be at work within me.\n\n'You had better leave off now for a short space,' said the tempter, 'and\ngo out and drink a pint of beer; you have still one shilling left--if you\ngo on at this rate, you will go mad--go out and spend sixpence, you can\nafford it, more than half your work is done.'  I was about to obey the\nsuggestion of the tempter, when the idea struck me that, if I did not\ncomplete the work whilst the fit was on me, I should never complete it;\nso I held on. I am almost afraid to state how many pages I wrote that day\nof the life of Joseph Sell.\n\nFrom this time I proceeded in a somewhat more leisurely manner; but, as I\ndrew nearer and nearer to the completion of my task, dreadful fears and\ndespondencies came over me.--It will be too late, thought I; by the time\nI have finished the work, the bookseller will have been supplied with a\ntale or a novel.  Is it probable that, in a town like this, where talent\nis so abundant--hungry talent too--a bookseller can advertise for a tale\nor a novel, without being supplied with half a dozen in twenty-four\nhours?  I may as well fling down my pen--I am writing to no purpose.  And\nthese thoughts came over my mind so often, that at last, in utter\ndespair, I flung down the pen.  Whereupon the tempter within me\nsaid--'And, now you have flung down the pen, you may as well fling\nyourself out of the window; what remains for you to do?'  Why, to take it\nup again, thought I to myself, for I did not like the latter suggestion\nat all--and then forthwith I resumed the pen, and wrote with greater\nvigour than before, from about six o'clock in the evening until I could\nhardly see, when I rested for a while, when the tempter within me again\nsaid, or appeared to say--'All you have been writing is stuff, it will\nnever do--a drug--a mere drug'; and methought these last words were\nuttered in the gruff tones of the big publisher.  'A thing merely to be\nsneezed at,' a voice like that of Taggart added; and then I seemed to\nhear a sternutation,--as I probably did, for, recovering from a kind of\nswoon, I found myself shivering with cold.  The next day I brought my\nwork to a conclusion.\n\nBut the task of revision still remained; for an hour or two I shrank from\nit, and remained gazing stupidly at the pile of paper which I had written\nover.  I was all but exhausted, and I dreaded, on inspecting the sheets,\nto find them full of absurdities which I had paid no regard to in the\nfuror of composition.  But the task, however trying to my nerves, must be\ngot over; at last, in a kind of desperation, I entered upon it.  It was\nfar from an easy one; there were, however, fewer errors and absurdities\nthan I had anticipated.  About twelve o'clock at night I had got over the\ntask of revision.  'To-morrow for the bookseller,' said I, as my head\nsank on the pillow.  'Oh me!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\n\nNervous look--The bookseller's wife--The last stake--Terms--God\nforbid!--Will you come to tea?--A light heart.\n\nOn arriving at the bookseller's shop, I cast a nervous look at the\nwindow, for the purpose of observing whether the paper had been removed\nor not.  To my great delight the paper was in its place; with a beating\nheart I entered, there was nobody in the shop; as I stood at the counter,\nhowever, deliberating whether or not I should call out, the door of what\nseemed to be a back-parlour opened, and out came a well-dressed lady-like\nfemale, of about thirty, with a good-looking and intelligent countenance.\n'What is your business, young man?' said she to me, after I had made her\na polite bow.  'I wish to speak to the gentleman of the house,' said I.\n'My husband is not within at present,' she replied; 'what is your\nbusiness?'  'I have merely brought something to show him,' said I, 'but I\nwill call again.'  'If you are the young gentleman who has been here\nbefore,' said the lady, 'with poems and ballads, as, indeed, I know you\nare,' she added, smiling, 'for I have seen you through the glass door, I\nam afraid it will be useless; that is,' she added with another smile, 'if\nyou bring us nothing else.'  'I have not brought you poems and ballads\nnow,' said I, 'but something widely different; I saw your advertisement\nfor a tale or a novel, and have written something which I think will\nsuit; and here it is,' I added, showing the roll of paper which I held in\nmy hand.  'Well,' said the bookseller's wife, 'you may leave it, though I\ncannot promise you much chance of its being accepted.  My husband has\nalready had several offered to him; however, you may leave it; give it\nme.  Are you afraid to intrust it to me?' she demanded somewhat hastily,\nobserving that I hesitated.  'Excuse me,' said I, 'but it is all I have\nto depend upon in the world; I am chiefly apprehensive that it will not\nbe read.'  'On that point I can reassure you,' said the good lady,\nsmiling, and there was now something sweet in her smile.  'I give you my\nword that it shall be read; come again to-morrow morning at eleven, when,\nif not approved, it shall be returned to you.'\n\nI returned to my lodging, and forthwith betook myself to bed,\nnotwithstanding the earliness of the hour.  I felt tolerably tranquil; I\nhad now cast my last stake, and was prepared to abide by the result.\nWhatever that result might be, I could have nothing to reproach myself\nwith; I had strained all the energies which nature had given me in order\nto rescue myself from the difficulties which surrounded me.  I presently\nsank into a sleep, which endured during the remainder of the day, and the\nwhole of the succeeding night.  I awoke about nine on the morrow, and\nspent my last threepence on a breakfast somewhat more luxurious than the\nimmediately preceding ones, for one penny of the sum was expended on the\npurchase of milk.\n\nAt the appointed hour I repaired to the house of the bookseller; the\nbookseller was in his shop.  'Ah,' said he, as soon as I entered, 'I am\nglad to see you.'  There was an unwonted heartiness in the bookseller's\ntones, an unwonted benignity in his face.  'So,' said he, after a pause,\n'you have taken my advice, written a book of adventure; nothing like\ntaking the advice, young man, of your superiors in age.  Well, I think\nyour book will do, and so does my wife, for whose judgment I have a great\nregard; as well I may, as she is the daughter of a first-rate novelist,\ndeceased.  I think I shall venture on sending your book to the press.'\n'But,' said I, 'we have not yet agreed upon terms.'  'Terms, terms,' said\nthe bookseller; 'ahem! well, there is nothing like coming to terms at\nonce.  I will print the book, and give you half the profit when the\nedition is sold.'  'That will not do,' said I; 'I intend shortly to leave\nLondon: I must have something at once.'  'Ah, I see,' said the\nbookseller, 'in distress; frequently the case with authors, especially\nyoung ones.  Well, I don't care if I purchase it of you, but you must be\nmoderate; the public are very fastidious, and the speculation may prove a\nlosing one after all.  Let me see, will five--hem--' he stopped.  I\nlooked the bookseller in the face; there was something peculiar in it.\nSuddenly it appeared to me as if the voice of him of the thimble sounded\nin my ear, 'Now is your time, ask enough, never such another chance of\nestablishing yourself; respectable trade, pea and thimble.'  'Well,' said\nI at last, 'I have no objection to take the offer which you were about to\nmake, though I really think five-and-twenty guineas to be scarcely\nenough, everything considered.'  'Five-and-twenty guineas!' said the\nbookseller; 'are you--what was I going to say--I never meant to offer\nhalf as much--I mean a quarter; I was going to say five guineas--I mean\npounds; I will, however, make it up guineas.'  'That will not do,' said\nI; 'but, as I find we shall not deal, return me my manuscript, that I may\ncarry it to some one else.'  The bookseller looked blank.  'Dear me,'\nsaid he, 'I should never have supposed that you would have made any\nobjection to such an offer; I am quite sure that you would have been glad\nto take five pounds for either of the two huge manuscripts of songs and\nballads that you brought me on a former occasion.'  'Well,' said I, 'if\nyou will engage to publish either of those two manuscripts, you shall\nhave the present one for five pounds.'  'God forbid that I should make\nany such bargain!' said the bookseller; 'I would publish neither on any\naccount; but, with respect to this last book, I have really an\ninclination to print it, both for your sake and mine; suppose we say ten\npounds.'  'No,' said I, 'ten pounds will not do; pray restore me my\nmanuscript.'  'Stay,' said the bookseller, 'my wife is in the next room,\nI will go and consult her.'  Thereupon he went into his back room, where\nI heard him conversing with his wife in a low tone; in about ten minutes\nhe returned.  'Young gentleman,' said he, 'perhaps you will take tea with\nus this evening, when we will talk further over the matter.'\n\nThat evening I went and took tea with the bookseller and his wife, both\nof whom, particularly the latter, overwhelmed me with civility.  It was\nnot long before I learned that the work had been already sent to the\npress, and was intended to stand at the head of a series of entertaining\nnarratives, from which my friends promised themselves considerable\nprofit.  The subject of terms was again brought forward.  I stood firm to\nmy first demand for a long time; when, however, the bookseller's wife\ncomplimented me on my production in the highest terms, and said that she\ndiscovered therein the germs of genius, which she made no doubt would\nsome day prove ornamental to my native land, I consented to drop my\ndemand to twenty pounds, stipulating, however, that I should not be\ntroubled with the correction of the work.\n\nBefore I departed, I received the twenty pounds, and departed with a\nlight heart to my lodgings.\n\nReader, amidst the difficulties and dangers of this life, should you ever\nbe tempted to despair, call to mind these latter chapters of the life of\nLavengro.  There are few positions, however difficult, from which dogged\nresolution and perseverance may not liberate you.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII\n\n\nIndisposition--A resolution--Poor equivalents--The piece of gold--Flashing\neyes--How beautiful--Bon jour, Monsieur.\n\nI had long ago determined to leave London as soon as the means should be\nin my power, and, now that they were, I determined to leave the Great\nCity; yet I felt some reluctance to go.  I would fain have pursued the\ncareer of original authorship which had just opened itself to me, and\nhave written other tales of adventure.  The bookseller had given me\nencouragement enough to do so; he had assured me that he should be always\nhappy to deal with me for an article (that was the word) similar to the\none I had brought him, provided my terms were moderate; and the\nbookseller's wife, by her complimentary language, had given me yet more\nencouragement.  But for some months past I had been far from well, and my\noriginal indisposition, brought on partly by the peculiar atmosphere of\nthe Big City, partly by anxiety of mind, had been much increased by the\nexertions which I had been compelled to make during the last few days.  I\nfelt that, were I to remain where I was, I should die, or become a\nconfirmed valetudinarian.  I would go forth into the country, travelling\non foot, and, by exercise and inhaling pure air, endeavour to recover my\nhealth, leaving my subsequent movements to be determined by Providence.\n\nBut whither should I bend my course?  Once or twice I thought of walking\nhome to the old town, stay some time with my mother and my brother, and\nenjoy the pleasant walks in the neighbourhood; but, though I wished very\nmuch to see my mother and my brother, and felt much disposed to enjoy the\nsaid pleasant walks, the old town was not exactly the place to which I\nwished to go at this present juncture.  I was afraid that people would\nask, Where are your Northern Ballads?  Where are your alliterative\ntranslations from Ab Gwilym--of which you were always talking, and with\nwhich you promised to astonish the world?  Now, in the event of such\ninterrogations, what could I answer?  It is true I had compiled _Newgate\nLives and Trials_, and had written the life of Joseph Sell, but I was\nafraid that the people of the old town would scarcely consider these as\nequivalents for the Northern Ballads and the songs of Ab Gwilym.  I would\ngo forth and wander in any direction but that of the old town.\n\nBut how one's sensibility on any particular point diminishes with time;\nat present I enter the old town perfectly indifferent as to what the\npeople may be thinking on the subject of the songs and ballads.  With\nrespect to the people themselves, whether, like my sensibility, their\ncuriosity has altogether evaporated, whether, which is at least equally\nprobable, they never entertained any, one thing is certain, that never in\na single instance have they troubled me with any remarks on the subject\nof the songs and ballads.\n\nAs it was my intention to travel on foot, with a bundle and a stick, I\ndespatched my trunk containing some few clothes and books to the old\ntown.  My preparations were soon made; in about three days I was in\nreadiness to start.\n\nBefore departing, however, I bethought me of my old friend the\napple-woman of London Bridge.  Apprehensive that she might be labouring\nunder the difficulties of poverty, I sent her a piece of gold by the\nhands of a young maiden in the house in which I lived.  The latter\npunctually executed her commission, but brought me back the piece of\ngold.  The old woman would not take it; she did not want it, she said.\n'Tell the poor thin lad,' she added, 'to keep it for himself, he wants it\nmore than I.'\n\nRather late one afternoon I departed from my lodging, with my stick in\none hand and a small bundle in the other, shaping my course to the south-\nwest: when I first arrived, somewhat more than a year before, I had\nentered the city by the north-east.  As I was not going home, I\ndetermined to take my departure in the direction the very opposite to\nhome.\n\nJust as I was about to cross the street called the Haymarket, at the\nlower part, a cabriolet, drawn by a magnificent animal, came dashing\nalong at a furious rate; it stopped close by the curb-stone where I was,\na sudden pull of the reins nearly bringing the spirited animal upon its\nhaunches.  The Jehu who had accomplished this feat was Francis Ardry.  A\nsmall beautiful female, with flashing eyes, dressed in the extremity of\nfashion, sat beside him.\n\n'Holloa, friend,' said Francis Ardry, 'whither bound?'\n\n'I do not know,' said I; 'all I can say is, that I am about to leave\nLondon.'\n\n'And the means?' said Francis Ardry.\n\n'I have them,' said I, with a cheerful smile.\n\n'Qui est celui-ci?' demanded the small female, impatiently.\n\n'C'est--mon ami le plus intime; so you were about to leave London,\nwithout telling me a word,' said Francis Ardry, somewhat angrily.\n\n'I intended to have written to you,' said I: 'what a splendid mare that\nis.'\n\n'Is she not?' said Francis Ardry, who was holding in the mare with\ndifficulty; 'she cost a hundred guineas.'\n\n'Qu'est ce qu'il dit?' demanded his companion.\n\n'Il dit que le jument est bien beau.'\n\n'Allons, mon ami, il est tard,' said the beauty, with a scornful toss of\nher head; 'allons!'\n\n'Encore un moment,' said Francis Ardry; 'and when shall I see you again?'\n\n'I scarcely know,' I replied: 'I never saw a more splendid turn out.'\n\n'Qu'est ce qu'il dit?' I said the lady again.\n\n'Il dit que tout l'equipage est en assez bon gout.'\n\n'Allons, c'est un ours,' said the lady; 'le cheval meme en a peur,' added\nshe, as the mare reared up on high.\n\n'Can you find nothing else to admire but the mare and the equipage?' said\nFrancis Ardry, reproachfully, after he had with some difficulty brought\nthe mare to order.\n\nLifting my hand, in which I held my stick, I took off my hat.  'How\nbeautiful!' said I, looking the lady full in the face.\n\n'Comment?' said the lady, inquiringly.\n\n'Il dit que vous etes belle comme un ange,' said Francis Ardry,\nemphatically.\n\n'Mais, a la bonne heure! arretez, mon ami,' said the lady to Francis\nArdry, who was about to drive off; 'je voudrais bien causer un moment\navec lui; arretez, il est delicieux.--Est-ce bien ainsi que vous traitez\nvos amis?' said she passionately, as Francis Ardry lifted up his whip.\n'Bon jour, Monsieur, bon jour,' said she, thrusting her head from the\nside and looking back, as Francis Ardry drove off at the rate of thirteen\nmiles an hour.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX\n\n\nThe milestone--The meditation--Want to get up?--The off-hand\nleader--Sixteen shillings--The near-hand wheeler--All right.\n\nIn about two hours I had cleared the Great City, and got beyond the\nsuburban villages, or rather towns, in the direction in which I was\ntravelling; I was in a broad and excellent road, leading I knew not\nwhither.  I now slackened my pace, which had hitherto been great.\nPresently, coming to a milestone on which was graven nine miles, I rested\nagainst it, and looking round towards the vast city, which had long\nceased to be visible, I fell into a train of meditation.\n\n{picture:Presently, coming to a milestone, I rested against it, and,\nlooking round towards the vast city, I fell into a train of meditation:\npage321.jpg}\n\nI thought of all my ways and doings since the day of my first arrival in\nthat vast city--I had worked and toiled, and, though I had accomplished\nnothing at all commensurate with the hopes which I had entertained\nprevious to my arrival, I had achieved my own living, preserved my\nindependence, and become indebted to no one.  I was now quitting it, poor\nin purse, it is true, but not wholly empty; rather ailing it may be, but\nnot broken in health; and, with hope within my bosom, had I not cause\nupon the whole to be thankful?  Perhaps there were some who, arriving at\nthe same time under not more favourable circumstances, had accomplished\nmuch more, and whose future was far more hopeful--Good!  But there might\nbe others who, in spite of all their efforts, had been either trodden\ndown in the press, never more to be heard of, or were quitting that\nmighty town broken in purse, broken in health, and, oh! with not one dear\nhope to cheer them.  Had I not, upon the whole, abundant cause to be\ngrateful?  Truly, yes!\n\nMy meditation over, I left the milestone and proceeded on my way in the\nsame direction as before until the night began to close in.  I had always\nbeen a good pedestrian; but now, whether owing to indisposition or to not\nhaving for some time past been much in the habit of taking such lengthy\nwalks, I began to feel not a little weary.  Just as I was thinking of\nputting up for the night at the next inn or public-house I should arrive\nat, I heard what sounded like a coach coming up rapidly behind me.\nInduced, perhaps, by the weariness which I felt, I stopped and looked\nwistfully in the direction of the sound; presently up came a coach,\nseemingly a mail, drawn by four bounding horses--there was no one upon it\nbut the coachman and the guard; when nearly parallel with me it stopped.\n'Want to get up?' sounded a voice, in the true coachman-like tone--half\nquerulous, half authoritative.  I hesitated; I was tired, it is true, but\nI had left London bound on a pedestrian excursion, and I did not much\nlike the idea of having recourse to a coach after accomplishing so very\ninconsiderable a distance.  'Come, we can't be staying here all night,'\nsaid the voice, more sharply than before.  'I can ride a little way, and\nget down whenever I like,' thought I; and springing forward I clambered\nup the coach, and was going to sit down upon the box, next the coachman.\n'No, no,' said the coachman, who was a man about thirty, with a hooked\nnose and red face, dressed in a fashionably-cut greatcoat, with a\nfashionable black castor on his head.  'No, no, keep behind--the box\nain't for the like of you,' said he, as he drove off; 'the box is for\nlords, or gentlemen at least.'  I made no answer.  'D--- that off-hand\nleader,' said the coachman, as the right-hand front horse made a\ndesperate start at something he saw in the road; and, half rising, he\nwith great dexterity hit with his long whip the off-hand leader a cut on\nthe off cheek.  'These seem to be fine horses,' said I.  The coachman\nmade no answer.  'Nearly thoroughbred,' I continued; the coachman drew\nhis breath, with a kind of hissing sound, through his teeth.  'Come,\nyoung fellow, none of your chaff.  Don't you think, because you ride on\nmy mail, I'm going to talk to you about 'orses.  I talk to nobody about\n'orses except lords.'  'Well,' said I, 'I have been called a lord in my\ntime.'  'It must have been by a thimble-rigger, then,' said the coachman,\nbending back, and half turning his face round with a broad leer.  'You\nhave hit the mark wonderfully,' said I.  'You coachmen, whatever else you\nmay be, are certainly no fools.'  'We ain't, ain't we?' said the\ncoachman.  'There you are right; and, to show you that you are, I'll now\ntrouble you for your fare.  If you have been amongst the thimble-riggers\nyou must be tolerably well cleared out.  Where are you going?--to--?  I\nthink I have seen you there.  The fare is sixteen shillings.  Come, tip\nus the blunt; them that has no money can't ride on my mail.'\n\nSixteen shillings was a large sum, and to pay it would make a\nconsiderable inroad on my slender finances; I thought, at first, that I\nwould say I did not want to go so far; but then the fellow would ask at\nonce where I wanted to go, and I was ashamed to acknowledge my utter\nignorance of the road.  I determined, therefore, to pay the fare, with a\ntacit determination not to mount a coach in future without knowing\nwhither I was going.  So I paid the man the money, who, turning round,\nshouted to the guard--'All right, Jem; got fare to--'; and forthwith\nwhipped on his horses, especially the off hand leader, for whom he seemed\nto entertain a particular spite, to greater speed than before--the horses\nflew.\n\nA young moon gave a feeble light, partially illuminating a line of road\nwhich, appearing by no means interesting, I the less regretted having\npaid my money for the privilege of being hurried along it in the flying\nvehicle.  We frequently changed horses; and at last my friend the\ncoachman was replaced by another, the very image of himself--hawk nose,\nred face, with narrow-rimmed hat and fashionable benjamin.  After he had\ndriven about fifty yards, the new coachman fell to whipping one of the\nhorses.  'D--- this near-hand wheeler,' said he, 'the brute has got a\ncorn.'  'Whipping him won't cure him of his corn,' said I.  'Who told you\nto speak?' said the driver, with an oath; 'mind your own business;\n'tisn't from the like of you I am to learn to drive 'orses.'  Presently I\nfell into a broken kind of slumber.  In an hour or two I was aroused by a\nrough voice--'Got to ---, young man; get down if you please.'  I opened\nmy eyes--there was a dim and indistinct light, like that which precedes\ndawn; the coach was standing still in something like a street; just below\nme stood the guard.  'Do you mean to get down,' said he, 'or will you\nkeep us here till morning? other fares want to get up.'  Scarcely knowing\nwhat I did, I took my bundle and stick and descended, whilst two people\nmounted.  'All right, John,' said the guard to the coachman, springing up\nbehind; whereupon off whisked the coach, one or two individuals who were\nstanding by disappeared, and I was left alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX\n\n\nThe still hour--A thrill--The wondrous circle--The shepherd--Heaps and\nbarrows--What do you mean?--Milk of the plains--Hengist spared it--No\npresents.\n\nAfter standing still a minute or two, considering what I should do, I\nmoved down what appeared to be the street of a small straggling town;\npresently I passed by a church, which rose indistinctly on my right hand;\nanon there was the rustling of foliage and the rushing of waters.  I\nreached a bridge, beneath which a small stream was running in the\ndirection of the south.  I stopped and leaned over the parapet, for I\nhave always loved to look upon streams, especially at the still hours.\n'What stream is this, I wonder?' said I, as I looked down from the\nparapet into the water, which whirled and gurgled below.\n\nLeaving the bridge, I ascended a gentle acclivity, and presently reached\nwhat appeared to be a tract of moory undulating ground.  It was now\ntolerably light, but there was a mist or haze abroad which prevented my\nseeing objects with much precision.  I felt chill in the damp air of the\nearly morn, and walked rapidly forward.  In about half an hour I arrived\nwhere the road divided into two, at an angle or tongue of dark green\nsward.  'To the right or the left?' said I, and forthwith took, without\nknowing why, the left-hand road, along which I proceeded about a hundred\nyards, when, in the midst of the tongue of sward formed by the two roads,\ncollaterally with myself, I perceived what I at first conceived to be a\nsmall grove of blighted trunks of oaks, barked and gray.  I stood still\nfor a moment, and then, turning off the road, advanced slowly towards it\nover the sward; as I drew nearer, I perceived that the objects which had\nattracted my curiosity, and which formed a kind of circle, were not\ntrees, but immense upright stones.  A thrill pervaded my system; just\nbefore me were two, the mightiest of the whole, tall as the stems of\nproud oaks, supporting on their tops a huge transverse stone, and forming\na wonderful doorway.  I knew now where I was, and, laying down my stick\nand bundle, and taking off my hat, I advanced slowly, and cast myself--it\nwas folly, perhaps, but I could not help what I did--cast myself, with my\nface on the dewy earth, in the middle of the portal of giants, beneath\nthe transverse stone.\n\n{picture:I cast myself with my face on the dewy earth.  The spirit of\nStonehenge was strong upon me!: page326.jpg}\n\nThe spirit of Stonehenge was strong upon me!\n\nAnd after I had remained with my face on the ground for some time, I\narose, placed my hat on my head, and, taking up my stick and bundle,\nwandered round the wondrous circle, examining each individual stone, from\nthe greatest to the least; and then, entering by the great door, seated\nmyself upon an immense broad stone, one side of which was supported by\nseveral small ones, and the other slanted upon the earth; and there, in\ndeep meditation, I sat for an hour or two, till the sun shone in my face\nabove the tall stones of the eastern side.\n\nAnd as I still sat there, I heard the noise of bells, and presently a\nlarge number of sheep came browsing past the circle of stones; two or\nthree entered, and grazed upon what they could find, and soon a man also\nentered the circle at the northern side.\n\n'Early here, sir,' said the man, who was tall, and dressed in a dark\ngreen slop, and had all the appearance of a shepherd; 'a traveller, I\nsuppose?'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'I am a traveller; are these sheep yours?'\n\n'They are, sir; that is, they are my master's.  A strange place this,\nsir,' said he, looking at the stones; 'ever here before?'\n\n'Never in body, frequently in mind.'\n\n'Heard of the stones, I suppose; no wonder--all the people of the plain\ntalk of them.'\n\n'What do the people of the plain say of them?'\n\n'Why, they say--How did they ever come here?'\n\n'Do they not suppose them to have been brought?'\n\n'Who should have brought them?'\n\n'I have read that they were brought by many thousand men.'\n\n'Where from?'\n\n'Ireland.'\n\n'How did they bring them?'\n\n'I don't know.'\n\n'And what did they bring them for?'\n\n'To form a temple, perhaps.'\n\n'What is that?'\n\n'A place to worship God in.'\n\n'A strange place to worship God in.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'It has no roof.'\n\n'Yes, it has.'\n\n'Where?' said the man, looking up.\n\n'What do you see above you?'\n\n'The sky.'\n\n'Well?'\n\n'Well!'\n\n'Have you anything to say?'\n\n'How did these stones come here?'\n\n'Are there other stones like these on the plains?' said I.\n\n'None; and yet there are plenty of strange things on these downs.'\n\n'What are they?'\n\n'Strange heaps, and barrows, and great walls of earth built on the tops\nof hills.'\n\n'Do the people of the plain wonder how they came there?'\n\n'They do not.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'They were raised by hands.'\n\n'And these stones?'\n\n'How did they ever come here?'\n\n'I wonder whether they are here?' said I.\n\n'These stones?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'So sure as the world,' said the man; 'and, as the world, they will stand\nas long.'\n\n'I wonder whether there is a world.'\n\n'What do you mean?'\n\n'An earth, and sea, moon and stars, sheep and men.'\n\n'Do you doubt it?'\n\n'Sometimes.'\n\n'I never heard it doubted before.'\n\n'It is impossible there should be a world.'\n\n'It ain't possible there shouldn't be a world.'\n\n'Just so.'  At this moment a fine ewe, attended by a lamb, rushed into\nthe circle and fondled the knees of the shepherd.  'I suppose you would\nnot care to have some milk,' said the man.\n\n'Why do you suppose so?'\n\n'Because, so be there be no sheep, no milk, you know; and what there\nben't is not worth having.'\n\n'You could not have argued better,' said I; 'that is, supposing you have\nargued; with respect to the milk you may do as you please.'\n\n'Be still, Nanny,' said the man; and producing a tin vessel from his\nscrip, he milked the ewe into it.  'Here is milk of the plains, master,'\nsaid the man, as he handed the vessel to me.\n\n'Where are those barrows and great walls of earth you were speaking of?'\nsaid I, after I had drunk some of the milk; 'are there any near where we\nare?'\n\n'Not within many miles; the nearest is yonder away,' said the shepherd,\npointing to the south-east.  'It's a grand place, that, but not like\nthis; quite different, and from it you have a sight of the finest spire\nin the world.'\n\n{picture:'The nearest is yonder away,' said the shepherd, pointing to the\nsouth-east: page329.jpg}\n\n'I must go to it,' said I, and I drank the remainder of the milk;\n'yonder, you say.'\n\n'Yes, yonder; but you cannot get to it in that direction, the river lies\nbetween.'\n\n'What river?'\n\n'The Avon.'\n\n'Avon is British,' said I.\n\n'Yes,' said the man, 'we are all British here.'\n\n'No, we are not,' said I.\n\n'What are we then?'\n\n'English.'\n\n'Ain't they one?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Who were the British?'\n\n'The men who are supposed to have worshipped God in this place, and who\nraised these stones.'\n\n'Where are they now?'\n\n'Our forefathers slaughtered them, spilled their blood all about,\nespecially in this neighbourhood, destroyed their pleasant places, and\nleft not, to use their own words, one stone upon another.'\n\n'Yes, they did,' said the shepherd, looking aloft at the transverse\nstone.\n\n'And it is well for them they did; whenever that stone, which English\nhands never raised, is by English hands thrown down, woe, woe, woe to the\nEnglish race; spare it, English! Hengist spared it!--Here is sixpence.'\n\n'I won't have it,' said the man.\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'You talk so prettily about these stones; you seem to know all about\nthem.'\n\n'I never receive presents; with respect to the stones, I say with\nyourself, How did they ever come here?'\n\n'How did they ever come here?' said the shepherd.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI\n\n\nThe river--Arid downs--A prospect.\n\nLeaving the shepherd, I bent my way in the direction pointed out by him\nas that in which the most remarkable of the strange remains of which he\nhad spoken lay.  I proceeded rapidly, making my way over the downs\ncovered with coarse grass and fern; with respect to the river of which he\nhad spoken, I reflected that, either by wading or swimming, I could\neasily transfer myself and what I bore to the opposite side.  On arriving\nat its banks, I found it a beautiful stream, but shallow, with here and\nthere a deep place where the water ran dark and still.\n\nAlways fond of the pure lymph, I undressed, and plunged into one of these\ngulfs, from which I emerged, my whole frame in a glow, and tingling with\ndelicious sensations.  After conveying my clothes and scanty baggage to\nthe farther side, I dressed, and then with hurried steps bent my course\nin the direction of some lofty ground; I at length found myself on a high-\nroad, leading over wide and arid downs; following the road for some miles\nwithout seeing anything remarkable, I supposed at length that I had taken\nthe wrong path, and wended on slowly and disconsolately for some time,\ntill, having nearly surmounted a steep hill, I knew at once, from certain\nappearances, that I was near the object of my search.  Turning to the\nright near the brow of the hill, I proceeded along a path which brought\nme to a causeway leading over a deep ravine, and connecting the hill with\nanother which had once formed part of it, for the ravine was evidently\nthe work of art.  I passed over the causeway, and found myself in a kind\nof gateway which admitted me into a square space of many acres,\nsurrounded on all sides by mounds or ramparts of earth.  Though I had\nnever been in such a place before, I knew that I stood within the\nprecincts of what had been a Roman encampment, and one probably of the\nlargest size, for many thousand warriors might have found room to perform\ntheir evolutions in that space, in which corn was now growing, the green\nears waving in the morning wind.\n\nAfter I had gazed about the space for a time, standing in the gateway\nformed by the mounds, I clambered up the mound to the left hand, and on\nthe top of that mound I found myself at a great altitude; beneath, at the\ndistance of a mile, was a fair old city, situated amongst verdant\nmeadows, watered with streams, and from the heart of that old city, from\namidst mighty trees, I beheld towering to the sky the finest spire in the\nworld.\n\nAnd after I had looked from the Roman rampart for a long time, I hurried\naway, and, retracing my steps along the cause-way, regained the road,\nand, passing over the brow of the hill, descended to the city of the\nspire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII\n\n\nThe hostelry--Life uncertain--Open countenance--The grand point--Thank\nyou, master--A hard mother--Poor dear!--Considerable odds--The better\ncountry--English fashion--Landlord-looking person.\n\nAnd in the old city I remained two days, passing my time as I best\ncould--inspecting the curiosities of the place, eating and drinking when\nI felt so disposed, which I frequently did, the digestive organs having\nassumed a tone to which for many months they had been strangers--enjoying\nat night balmy sleep in a large bed in a dusky room, at the end of a\ncorridor, in a certain hostelry in which I had taken up my\nquarters--receiving from the people of the hostelry such civility and\ncondescension as people who travel on foot with bundle and stick, but who\nnevertheless are perceived to be not altogether destitute of coin, are in\nthe habit of receiving.  On the third day, on a fine sunny afternoon, I\ndeparted from the city of the spire.\n\nAs I was passing through one of the suburbs, I saw, all on a sudden, a\nrespectable-looking female fall down in a fit; several persons hastened\nto her assistance.  'She is dead,' said one.  'No, she is not,' said\nanother.  'I am afraid she is,' said a third.  'Life is very uncertain,'\nsaid a fourth.  'It is Mrs. ---,' said a fifth; 'let us carry her to her\nown house.'  Not being able to render any assistance, I left the poor\nfemale in the hands of her townsfolk, and proceeded on my way.  I had\nchosen a road in the direction of the north-west, it led over downs where\ncorn was growing, but where neither tree nor hedge was to be seen; two or\nthree hours' walking brought me to a beautiful valley, abounding with\ntrees of various kinds, with a delightful village at its farthest\nextremity; passing through it, I ascended a lofty acclivity, on the top\nof which I sat down on a bank, and, taking off my hat, permitted a\nbreeze, which swept coolly and refreshingly over the downs, to dry my\nhair, dripping from the effects of exercise and the heat of the day.\n\nAnd as I sat there, gazing now at the blue heavens, now at the downs\nbefore me, a man came along the road in the direction in which I had\nhitherto been proceeding: just opposite to me he stopped, and, looking at\nme, cried--'Am I right for London, master?'\n\nHe was dressed like a sailor, and appeared to be between twenty-five and\nthirty years of age--he had an open manly countenance, and there was a\nbold and fearless expression in his eye.\n\n'Yes,' said I, in reply to his question; 'this is one of the ways to\nLondon.  Do you come from far?'\n\n'From ---,' said the man, naming a well-known seaport.\n\n'Is this the direct road to London from that place?' I demanded.\n\n'No,' said the man; 'but I had to visit two or three other places on\ncertain commissions I was intrusted with; amongst others to ---, where I\nhad to take a small sum of money.  I am rather tired, master; and, if you\nplease, I will sit down beside you.'\n\n'You have as much right to sit down here as I have,' said I; 'the road is\nfree for every one; as for sitting down beside me, you have the look of\nan honest man, and I have no objection to your company.'\n\n'Why, as for being honest, master,' said the man, laughing and sitting\ndown by me, 'I haven't much to say--many is the wild thing I have done\nwhen I was younger; however, what is done, is done.  To learn, one must\nlive, master; and I have lived long enough to learn the grand point of\nwisdom.'\n\n'What is that?' said I.\n\n'That honesty is the best policy, master.'\n\n'You appear to be a sailor,' said I, looking at his dress.\n\n'I was not bred a sailor,' said the man, 'though, when my foot is on the\nsalt water, I can play the part--and play it well too.  I am now from a\nlong voyage.'\n\n'From America?' said I.\n\n'Farther than that,' said the man.\n\n'Have you any objection to tell me?' said I.\n\n'From New South Wales,' said the man, looking me full in the face.\n\n'Dear me,' said I.\n\n'Why do you say \"Dear me\"?' said the man.\n\n'It is a very long way off,' said I.\n\n'Was that your reason for saying so?' said the man.\n\n'Not exactly,' said I.\n\n'No,' said the man, with something of a bitter smile; 'it was something\nelse that made you say so; you were thinking of the convicts.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'what then--you are no convict.'\n\n'How do you know?'\n\n'You do not look like one.'\n\n'Thank you, master,' said the man cheerfully; 'and, to a certain extent,\nyou are right--bygones are bygones--I am no longer what I was, nor ever\nwill be again; the truth, however, is the truth--a convict I have been--a\nconvict at Sydney Cove.'\n\n'And you have served out the period for which you were sentenced, and are\nnow returned?'\n\n'As to serving out my sentence,' replied the man, 'I can't say that I\ndid; I was sentenced for fourteen years, and I was in Sydney Cove little\nmore than half that time.  The truth is that I did the Government a\nservice.  There was a conspiracy amongst some of the convicts to murder\nand destroy--I overheard and informed the Government; mind one thing,\nhowever, I was not concerned in it; those who got it up were no comrades\nof mine, but a bloody gang of villains.  Well, the Government, in\nconsideration of the service I had done them, remitted the remainder of\nmy sentence; and some kind gentlemen interested themselves about me, gave\nme good books and good advice, and, being satisfied with my conduct,\nprocured me employ in an exploring expedition, by which I earned money.\nIn fact, the being sent to Sydney was the best thing that ever happened\nto me in all my life.'\n\n'And you have now returned to your native country.  Longing to see home\nbrought you from New South Wales.'\n\n'There you are mistaken,' said the man.  'Wish to see England again would\nnever have brought me so far; for, to tell you the truth, master, England\nwas a hard mother to me, as she has proved to many.  No, a wish to see\nanother kind of mother--a poor old woman, whose son I am--has brought me\nback.'\n\n'You have a mother, then?' said I.  'Does she reside in London?'\n\n'She used to live in London,' said the man; 'but I am afraid she is long\nsince dead.'\n\n'How did she support herself?' said I.\n\n'Support herself! with difficulty enough; she used to keep a small stall\non London Bridge, where she sold fruit; I am afraid she is dead, and that\nshe died perhaps in misery.  She was a poor sinful creature; but I loved\nher, and she loved me.  I came all the way back merely for the chance of\nseeing her.'\n\n'Did you ever write to her,' said I, 'or cause others to write to her?'\n\n'I wrote to her myself,' said the man, 'about two years ago; but I never\nreceived an answer.  I learned to write very tolerably over there, by the\nassistance of the good people I spoke of.  As for reading, I could do\nthat very well before I went--my poor mother taught me to read, out of a\nbook that she was very fond of; a strange book it was, I remember.  Poor\ndear!--what I would give only to know that she is alive.'\n\n'Life is very uncertain,' said I.\n\n'That is true,' said the man, with a sigh.\n\n'We are here one moment, and gone the next,' I continued.  'As I passed\nthrough the streets of a neighbouring town, I saw a respectable woman\ndrop down, and people said she was dead.  Who knows but that she too had\na son coming to see her from a distance, at that very time?'\n\n'Who knows, indeed?' said the man.  'Ah, I am afraid my mother is dead.\nWell, God's will be done.'\n\n'However,' said I, 'I should not wonder at your finding your mother\nalive.'\n\n'You wouldn't?' said the man, looking at me wistfully.\n\n'I should not wonder at all,' said I; 'indeed, something within me seems\nto tell me you will; I should not much mind betting five shillings to\nfivepence that you will see your mother within a week.  Now, friend, five\nshillings to fivepence--'\n\n'Is very considerable odds,' said the man, rubbing his hands; 'sure you\nmust have good reason to hope, when you are willing to give such odds.'\n\n'After all,' said I, 'it not unfrequently happens that those who lay the\nlong odds lose.  Let us hope, however.  What do you mean to do in the\nevent of finding your mother alive?'\n\n'I scarcely know,' said the man; 'I have frequently thought that if I\nfound my mother alive I would attempt to persuade her to accompany me to\nthe country which I have left--it is a better country for a man--that is,\na free man--to live in than this; however, let me first find my mother--if\nI could only find my mother--'\n\n'Farewell,' said I, rising.  'Go your way, and God go with you--I will go\nmine.'  'I have but one thing to ask you,' said the man.  'What is that?'\nI inquired.  'That you would drink with me before we part--you have done\nme so much good.'  'How should we drink?' said I; 'we are on the top of a\nhill where there is nothing to drink.'  'But there is a village below,'\nsaid the man; 'do let us drink before we part.'  'I have been through\nthat village already,' said I, 'and I do not like turning back.'  'Ah,'\nsaid the man, sorrowfully, 'you will not drink with me because I told you\nI was--'  'You are quite mistaken,' said I, 'I would as soon drink with a\nconvict as with a judge.  I am by no means certain that, under the same\ncircumstances, the judge would be one whit better than the convict.  Come\nalong!  I will go back to oblige you.  I have an odd sixpence in my\npocket, which I will change that I may drink with you.'  So we went down\nthe hill together to the village through which I had already passed,\nwhere, finding a public-house, we drank together in true English fashion,\nafter which we parted, the sailor-looking man going his way and I mine.\n\nAfter walking about a dozen miles, I came to a town, where I rested for\nthe night.  The next morning I set out again in the direction of the\nnorth-west.  I continued journeying for four days, my daily journeys\nvarying from twenty to twenty-five miles.  During this time nothing\noccurred to me worthy of any especial notice.  The weather was brilliant,\nand I rapidly improved both in strength and spirits.  On the fifth day,\nabout two o'clock, I arrived at a small town.  Feeling hungry, I entered\na decent-looking inn--within a kind of bar I saw a huge, fat, landlord-\nlooking person, with a very pretty, smartly-dressed maiden.  Addressing\nmyself to the fat man, 'House!' said I, 'house!  Can I have dinner,\nhouse?'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII\n\n\nPrimitive habits--Rosy-faced damsel--A pleasant moment--Suit of black--The\nfurtive glance--The mighty round--Degenerate times--The newspaper--The\nevil chance--I congratulate you.\n\n'Young gentleman,' said the huge fat landlord, 'you are come at the right\ntime; dinner will be taken up in a few minutes, and such a dinner,' he\ncontinued, rubbing his hands, 'as you will not see every day in these\ntimes.'\n\n'I am hot and dusty,' said I, 'and should wish to cool my hands and\nface.'\n\n'Jenny!' said the huge landlord, with the utmost gravity, 'show the\ngentleman into number seven, that he may wash his hands and face.'\n\n'By no means,' said I, 'I am a person of primitive habits, and there is\nnothing like the pump in weather like this.'\n\n'Jenny,' said the landlord, with the same gravity as before, 'go with the\nyoung gentleman to the pump in the back kitchen, and take a clean towel\nalong with you.'\n\nThereupon the rosy-faced clean-looking damsel went to a drawer, and\nproducing a large, thick, but snowy white towel, she nodded to me to\nfollow her; whereupon I followed Jenny through a long passage into the\nback kitchen.\n\nAnd at the end of the back kitchen there stood a pump; and going to it I\nplaced my hands beneath the spout, and said, 'Pump, Jenny'; and Jenny\nincontinently, without laying down the towel, pumped with one hand, and I\nwashed and cooled my heated hands.\n\nAnd, when my hands were washed and cooled, I took off my neckcloth, and,\nunbuttoning my shirt collar, I placed my head beneath the spout of the\npump, and I said unto Jenny, 'Now, Jenny, lay down the towel, and pump\nfor your life.'\n\n{picture:'Now, Jenny, lay down the towel and pump for your life.':\npage338.jpg}\n\nThereupon Jenny, placing the towel on a linen-horse, took the handle of\nthe pump with both hands and pumped over my head as handmaid had never\npumped before; so that the water poured in torrents from my head, my\nface, and my hair down upon the brick floor.\n\nAnd, after the lapse of somewhat more than a minute, I called out with a\nhalf-strangled voice, 'Hold, Jenny!' and Jenny desisted.  I stood for a\nfew moments to recover my breath, then taking the towel which Jenny\nproffered, I dried composedly my hands and head, my face and hair; then,\nreturning the towel to Jenny, I gave a deep sigh and said, 'Surely this\nis one of the pleasant moments of life.'\n\nThen, having set my dress to rights, and combed my hair with a pocket\ncomb, I followed Jenny, who conducted me back through the long passage,\nand showed me into a neat sanded parlour on the ground-floor.\n\nI sat down by a window which looked out upon the dusty street; presently\nin came the handmaid, and commenced laying the table-cloth.  'Shall I\nspread the table for one, sir,' said she, 'or do you expect anybody to\ndine with you?'  'I can't say that I expect anybody,' said I, laughing\ninwardly to myself; 'however, if you please you can lay for two, so that\nif any acquaintance of mine should chance to step in, he may find a knife\nand fork ready for him.'\n\nSo I sat by the window, sometimes looking out upon the dusty street, and\nnow glancing at certain old-fashioned prints which adorned the wall over\nagainst me.  I fell into a kind of doze, from which I was almost\ninstantly awakened by the opening of the door.  Dinner, thought I; and I\nsat upright in my chair.  No; a man of the middle age, and rather above\nthe middle height, dressed in a plain suit of black, made his appearance,\nand sat down in a chair at some distance from me, but near to the table,\nand appeared to be lost in thought.\n\n'The weather is very warm, sir,' said I.\n\n'Very,' said the stranger, laconically, looking at me for the first time.\n\n'Would you like to see the newspaper?' said I, taking up one which lay\nupon the window seat.\n\n'I never read newspapers,' said the stranger, 'nor, indeed,--'  Whatever\nit might be that he had intended to say he left unfinished.  Suddenly he\nwalked to the mantelpiece at the farther end of the room, before which he\nplaced himself with his back towards me.  There he remained motionless\nfor some time; at length, raising his hand, he touched the corner of the\nmantelpiece with his finger, advanced towards the chair which he had\nleft, and again seated himself.\n\n'Have you come far?' said he, suddenly looking towards me, and speaking\nin a frank and open manner, which denoted a wish to enter into\nconversation.  'You do not seem to be of this place.'\n\n'I come from some distance,' said I; 'indeed, I am walking for exercise,\nwhich I find as necessary to the mind as the body.  I believe that by\nexercise people would escape much mental misery.'\n\nScarcely had I uttered these words when the stranger laid his hand, with\nseeming carelessness, upon the table, near one of the glasses; after a\nmoment or two he touched the glass with his finger as if inadvertently,\nthen, glancing furtively at me, he withdrew his hand and looked towards\nthe window.\n\n'Are you from these parts?' said I at last, with apparent carelessness.\n\n'From this vicinity,' replied the stranger.  'You think, then, that it is\nas easy to walk off the bad humours of the mind as of the body?'\n\n'I, at least, am walking in that hope,' said I.\n\n'I wish you may be successful,' said the stranger; and here he touched\none of the forks which lay on the table near him.\n\nHere the door, which was slightly ajar, was suddenly pushed open with\nsome fracas, and in came the stout landlord, supporting with some\ndifficulty an immense dish, in which was a mighty round mass of smoking\nmeat garnished all round with vegetables; so high was the mass that it\nprobably obstructed his view, for it was not until he had placed it upon\nthe table that he appeared to observe the stranger; he almost started,\nand quite out of breath exclaimed, 'God bless me, your honour; is your\nhonour the acquaintance that the young gentleman was expecting?'\n\n'Is the young gentleman expecting an acquaintance?' said the stranger.\n\nThere is nothing like putting a good face upon these matters, thought I\nto myself; and, getting up, I bowed to the unknown.  'Sir,' said I, 'when\nI told Jenny that she might lay the table-cloth for two, so that in the\nevent of any acquaintance dropping in he might find a knife and fork\nready for him, I was merely jocular, being an entire stranger in these\nparts, and expecting no one.  Fortune, however, it would seem, has been\nunexpectedly kind to me; I flatter myself, sir, that since you have been\nin this room I have had the honour of making your acquaintance; and in\nthe strength of that hope I humbly entreat you to honour me with your\ncompany to dinner, provided you have not already dined.'\n\nThe stranger laughed outright.\n\n'Sir,' I continued, 'the round of beef is a noble one, and seems\nexceedingly well boiled, and the landlord was just right when he said I\nshould have such a dinner as is not seen every day.  A round of beef, at\nany rate such a round of beef as this, is seldom seen smoking upon the\ntable in these degenerate times.  Allow me, sir,' said I, observing that\nthe stranger was about to speak, 'allow me another remark.  I think I saw\nyou just now touch the fork; I venture to hail it as an omen that you\nwill presently seize it, and apply it to its proper purpose, and its\ncompanion the knife also.'\n\nThe stranger changed colour, and gazed upon me in silence.\n\n'Do, sir,' here put in the landlord; 'do, sir, accept the young\ngentleman's invitation.  Your honour has of late been looking poorly, and\nthe young gentleman is a funny young gentleman, and a clever young\ngentleman; and I think it will do your honour good to have a dinner's\nchat with the young gentleman.'\n\n'It is not my dinner hour,' said the stranger; 'I dine considerably\nlater; taking anything now would only discompose me; I shall, however, be\nmost happy to sit down with the young gentleman; reach me that paper,\nand, when the young gentleman has satisfied his appetite, we may perhaps\nhave a little chat together.'\n\nThe landlord handed the stranger the newspaper, and, bowing, retired with\nhis maid Jenny.  I helped myself to a portion of the smoking round, and\ncommenced eating with no little appetite.  The stranger appeared to be\nsoon engrossed with the newspaper.  We continued thus a considerable\ntime--the one reading and the other dining.  Chancing suddenly to cast my\neyes upon the stranger, I saw his brow contract; he gave a slight stamp\nwith his foot, and flung the newspaper to the ground, then stooping down\nhe picked it up, first moving his forefinger along the floor, seemingly\nslightly scratching it with his nail.\n\n'Do you hope, sir,' said I, 'by that ceremony with the finger to preserve\nyourself from the evil chance?'\n\nThe stranger started; then, after looking at me for some time in silence,\nhe said, 'Is it possible that you--?'\n\n'Ay, ay,' said I, helping myself to some more of the round; 'I have\ntouched myself in my younger days, both for the evil chance and the good.\nCan't say, though, that I ever trusted much in the ceremony.'\n\nThe stranger made no reply, but appeared to be in deep thought; nothing\nfarther passed between us until I had concluded the dinner, when I said\nto him, 'I shall now be most happy, sir, to have the pleasure of your\nconversation over a pint of wine.'\n\nThe stranger rose; 'No, my young friend,' said he, smiling, 'that would\nscarce be fair.  It is my turn now--pray do me the favour to go home with\nme, and accept what hospitality my poor roof can offer; to tell you the\ntruth, I wish to have some particular discourse with you which would\nhardly be possible in this place.  As for wine, I can give you some much\nbetter than you can get here: the landlord is an excellent fellow, but he\nis an innkeeper after all.  I am going out for a moment, and will send\nhim in, so that you may settle your account; I trust you will not refuse\nme, I only live about two miles from here.'\n\nI looked in the face of the stranger--it was a fine intelligent face,\nwith a cast of melancholy in it.  'Sir,' said I, 'I would go with you\nthough you lived four miles instead of two.'\n\n'Who is that gentleman?' said I to the landlord, after I had settled his\nbill; 'I am going home with him.'\n\n'I wish I were going too,' said the fat landlord, laying his hand upon\nhis stomach.  'Young gentleman, I shall be a loser by his honour's taking\nyou away; but, after all, the truth is the truth--there are few gentlemen\nin these parts like his honour, either for learning or welcoming his\nfriends.  Young gentleman, I congratulate you.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV\n\n\nNew acquaintance--Old French style--The portrait--Taciturnity--The\nevergreen tree--The dark hour--The flash--Ancestors--A fortunate man--A\nposthumous child--Antagonist ideas--The hawks--Flaws--The\npony--Irresistible impulse--Favourable crisis--The topmost branch--Twenty\nfeet--Heartily ashamed.\n\nI found the stranger awaiting me at the door of the inn.  'Like yourself,\nI am fond of walking,' said he, 'and when any little business calls me to\nthis place I generally come on foot.'\n\nWe were soon out of the town, and in a very beautiful country.  After\nproceeding some distance on the high-road, we turned off, and were\npresently in one of those mazes of lanes for which England is famous; the\nstranger at first seemed inclined to be taciturn; a few observations,\nhowever, which I made appeared to rouse him, and he soon exhibited not\nonly considerable powers of conversation, but stores of information which\nsurprised me.  So pleased did I become with my new acquaintance that I\nsoon ceased to pay the slightest attention either to place or distance.\nAt length the stranger was silent, and I perceived that we had arrived at\na handsome iron gate and a lodge; the stranger having rung a bell, the\ngate was opened by an old man, and we proceeded along a gravel path,\nwhich in about five minutes brought us to a large brick house, built\nsomething in the old French style, having a spacious lawn before it, and\nimmediately in front a pond in which were golden fish, and in the middle\na stone swan discharging quantities of water from its bill.  We ascended\na spacious flight of steps to the door, which was at once flung open, and\ntwo servants with powdered hair and in livery of blue plush came out and\nstood one on either side as we passed the threshold.  We entered a large\nhall, and the stranger, taking me by the hand, welcomed me to his poor\nhome, as he called it, and then gave orders to another servant, but out\nof livery, to show me to an apartment, and give me whatever assistance I\nmight require in my toilet.  Notwithstanding the plea as to primitive\nhabits which I had lately made to my other host in the town, I offered no\nobjection to this arrangement, but followed the bowing domestic to a\nspacious and airy chamber, where he rendered me all those little nameless\noffices which the somewhat neglected state of my dress required.  When\neverything had been completed to my perfect satisfaction, he told me that\nif I pleased he would conduct me to the library, where dinner would be\nspeedily served.\n\nIn the library I found a table laid for two; my host was not there,\nhaving as I supposed not been quite so speedy with his toilet as his\nguest.  Left alone, I looked round the apartment with inquiring eyes; it\nwas long and tolerably lofty, the walls from the top to the bottom were\nlined with cases containing books of all sizes and bindings; there was a\nglobe or two, a couch, and an easy-chair.  Statues and busts there were\nnone, and only one painting, a portrait, that of my host, but not him of\nthe mansion.  Over the mantelpiece, the features staringly like, but so\nridiculously exaggerated that they scarcely resembled those of a human\nbeing, daubed evidently by the hand of the commonest sign-artist, hung a\nhalf-length portrait of him of round of beef celebrity--my sturdy host of\nthe town.\n\nI had been in the library about ten minutes, amusing myself as I best\ncould, when my friend entered; he seemed to have resumed his\ntaciturnity--scarce a word escaped his lips till dinner was served, when\nhe said, smiling, 'I suppose it would be merely a compliment to ask you\nto partake?'\n\n'I don't know,' said I, seating myself; 'your first course consists of\ntroutlets, I am fond of troutlets, and I always like to be\ncompanionable.'\n\nThe dinner was excellent, though I did but little justice to it from the\ncircumstance of having already dined; the stranger also, though without\nmy excuse, partook but slightly of the good cheer; he still continued\ntaciturn, and appeared lost in thought, and every attempt which I made to\ninduce him to converse was signally unsuccessful.\n\nAnd now dinner was removed, and we sat over our wine, and I remember that\nthe wine was good, and fully justified the encomiums of my host of the\ntown.  Over the wine I made sure that my entertainer would have loosened\nthe chain which seemed to tie his tongue--but no!  I endeavoured to tempt\nhim by various topics, and talked of geometry and the use of the globes,\nof the heavenly sphere, and the star Jupiter, which I said I had heard\nwas a very large star, also of the evergreen tree, which, according to\nOlaus, stood of old before the heathen temple of Upsal, and which I\naffirmed was a yew--but no, nothing that I said could induce my\nentertainer to relax his taciturnity.\n\nIt grew dark, and I became uncomfortable.  'I must presently be going,' I\nat last exclaimed.\n\nAt these words he gave a sudden start; 'Going,' said he, 'are you not my\nguest, and an honoured one?'\n\n'You know best,' said I; 'but I was apprehensive I was an intruder; to\nseveral of my questions you have returned no answer.'\n\n'Ten thousand pardons!' he exclaimed, seizing me by the hand; 'but you\ncannot go now, I have much to talk to you about--there is one thing in\nparticular--'\n\n'If it be the evergreen tree at Upsal,' said I, interrupting him, 'I hold\nit to have been a yew--what else?  The evergreens of the south, as the\nold bishop observes, will not grow in the north, and a pine was unfitted\nfor such a locality, being a vulgar tree.  What else could it have been\nbut the yew--the sacred yew which our ancestors were in the habit of\nplanting in their churchyards?  Moreover, I affirm it to have been the\nyew for the honour of the tree; for I love the yew, and had I home and\nland, I would have one growing before my front windows.'\n\n'You would do right, the yew is indeed a venerable tree, but it is not\nabout the yew.'\n\n'The star Jupiter, perhaps?'\n\n'Nor the star Jupiter, nor its moons; an observation which escaped you at\nthe inn has made a considerable impression upon me.'\n\n'But I really must take my departure,' said I; 'the dark hour is at\nhand.'\n\nAnd as I uttered these latter words the stranger touched rapidly\nsomething which lay near him--I forget what it was.  It was the first\naction of the kind which I had observed on his part since we sat down to\ntable.\n\n'You allude to the evil chance,' said I; 'but it is getting both dark and\nlate.'\n\n'I believe we are going to have a storm,' said my friend, 'but I really\nhope that you will give me your company for a day or two; I have, as I\nsaid before, much to talk to you about.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'I shall be most happy to be your guest for this night; I\nam ignorant of the country, and it is not pleasant to travel unknown\npaths by night--dear me, what a flash of lightning.'\n\nIt had become very dark; suddenly a blaze of sheet lightning illumed the\nroom.  By the momentary light I distinctly saw my host touch another\nobject upon the table.\n\n'Will you allow me to ask you a question or two?' said he at last.\n\n'As many as you please,' said I; 'but shall we not have lights?'\n\n'Not unless you particularly wish it,' said my entertainer; 'I rather\nlike the dark, and though a storm is evidently at hand, neither thunder\nnor lightning has any terrors for me.  It is other things I quake at--I\nshould rather say ideas.  Now permit me to ask you--'\n\nAnd then my entertainer asked me various questions, to all of which I\nanswered unreservedly; he was then silent for some time, at last he\nexclaimed, 'I should wish to tell you the history of my life--though not\nan adventurous one, I think it contains some things which will interest\nyou.'\n\nWithout waiting for my reply he began.  Amidst darkness and gloom,\noccasionally broken by flashes of lightning, the stranger related to me,\nas we sat at table in the library, his truly touching history.\n\n'Before proceeding to relate the events of my life, it will not be amiss\nto give you some account of my ancestors.  My great-grandfather on the\nmale side was a silk mercer, in Cheapside, who, when he died, left his\nson, who was his only child, a fortune of one hundred thousand pounds and\na splendid business; the son, however, had no inclination for trade, the\nsummit of his ambition was to be a country gentleman, to found a family,\nand to pass the remainder of his days in rural ease and dignity, and all\nthis he managed to accomplish; he disposed of his business, purchased a\nbeautiful and extensive estate for fourscore thousand pounds, built upon\nit the mansion to which I had the honour of welcoming you to-day, married\nthe daughter of a neighbouring squire, who brought him a fortune of five\nthousand pounds, became a magistrate, and only wanted a son and heir to\nmake him completely happy; this blessing, it is true, was for a long time\ndenied him; it came, however, at last, as is usual, when least expected.\nHis lady was brought to bed of my father, and then who so happy a man as\nmy grandsire; he gave away two thousand pounds in charities, and in the\njoy of his heart made a speech at the next quarter sessions; the rest of\nhis life was spent in ease, tranquillity, and rural dignity; he died of\napoplexy on the day that my father came of age; perhaps it would be\ndifficult to mention a man who in all respects was so fortunate as my\ngrandfather: his death was sudden it is true, but I am not one of those\nwho pray to be delivered from a sudden death.\n\n'I should not call my father a fortunate man; it is true that he had the\nadvantage of a first-rate education; that he made the grand tour with a\nprivate tutor, as was the fashion at that time; that he came to a\nsplendid fortune on the very day that he came of age; that for many years\nhe tasted all the diversions of the capital that, at last determined to\nsettle, he married the sister of a baronet, an amiable and accomplished\nlady, with a large fortune; that he had the best stud of hunters in the\ncounty, on which, during the season, he followed the fox gallantly; had\nhe been a fortunate man he would never have cursed his fate, as he was\nfrequently known to do; ten months after his marriage his horse fell upon\nhim, and so injured him, that he expired in a few days in great agony.  My\ngrandfather was, indeed, a fortunate man; when he died he was followed to\nthe grave by the tears of the poor--my father was not.\n\n'Two remarkable circumstances are connected with my birth--I am a\nposthumous child, and came into the world some weeks before the usual\ntime, the shock which my mother experienced at my father's death having\nbrought on the pangs of premature labour; both my mother's life and my\nown were at first despaired of; we both, however, survived the crisis.  My\nmother loved me with the most passionate fondness, and I was brought up\nin this house under her own eye--I was never sent to school.\n\n'I have already told you that mine is not a tale of adventure; my life\nhas not been one of action, but of wild imaginings and strange\nsensations; I was born with excessive sensibility, and that has been my\nbane.  I have not been a fortunate man.\n\n'No one is fortunate unless he is happy, and it is impossible for a being\nconstructed like myself to be happy for an hour, or even enjoy peace and\ntranquillity; most of our pleasures and pains are the effects of\nimagination, and wherever the sensibility is great, the imagination is\ngreat also.  No sooner has my imagination raised up an image of pleasure,\nthan it is sure to conjure up one of distress and gloom; these two\nantagonist ideas instantly commence a struggle in my mind, and the gloomy\none generally, I may say invariably, prevails.  How is it possible that I\nshould be a happy man?\n\n'It has invariably been so with me from the earliest period that I can\nremember; the first playthings that were given me caused me for a few\nminutes excessive pleasure: they were pretty and glittering; presently,\nhowever, I became anxious and perplexed, I wished to know their history,\nhow they were made, and what of--were the materials precious?  I was not\nsatisfied with their outward appearance.  In less than an hour I had\nbroken the playthings in an attempt to discover what they were made of.\n\n'When I was eight years of age my uncle the baronet, who was also my\ngodfather, sent me a pair of Norway hawks, with directions for managing\nthem; he was a great fowler.  Oh, how rejoiced was I with the present\nwhich had been made me, my joy lasted for at least five minutes; I would\nlet them breed, I would have a house of hawks; yes, that I would--but--and\nhere came the unpleasant idea--suppose they were to flyaway, how very\nannoying!  Ah, but, said hope, there's little fear of that; feed them\nwell and they will never fly away, or if they do they will come back, my\nuncle says so; so sunshine triumphed for a little time.  Then the\nstrangest of all doubts came into my head; I doubted the legality of my\ntenure of these hawks; how did I come by them? why, my uncle gave them to\nme, but how did they come into his possession? what right had he to them?\nafter all, they might not be his to give.  I passed a sleepless night.\nThe next morning I found that the man who brought the hawks had not\ndeparted.  \"How came my uncle by these hawks?\" I anxiously inquired.\n\"They were sent to him from Norway, master, with another pair.\"  \"And who\nsent them?\"  \"That I don't know, master, but I suppose his honour can\ntell you.\"  I was even thinking of scrawling a letter to my uncle to make\ninquiry on this point, but shame restrained me, and I likewise reflected\nthat it would be impossible for him to give my mind entire satisfaction;\nit is true he could tell who sent him the hawks, but how was he to know\nhow the hawks came into the possession of those who sent them to him, and\nby what right they possessed them or the parents of the hawks?  In a\nword, I wanted a clear valid title, as lawyers would say, to my hawks,\nand I believe no title would have satisfied me that did not extend up to\nthe time of the first hawk, that is, prior to Adam; and, could I have\nobtained such a title, I make no doubt that, young as I was, I should\nhave suspected that it was full of flaws.\n\n'I was now disgusted with the hawks, and no wonder, seeing all the\ndisquietude they had caused me; I soon totally neglected the poor birds,\nand they would have starved had not some of the servants taken compassion\nupon them and fed them.  My uncle, soon hearing of my neglect, was angry,\nand took the birds away; he was a very good-natured man, however, and\nsoon sent me a fine pony; at first I was charmed with the pony, soon,\nhowever, the same kind of thoughts arose which had disgusted me on a\nformer occasion.  How did my uncle become possessed of the pony?  This\nquestion I asked him the first time I saw him.  Oh, he had bought it of a\ngypsy, that I might learn to ride upon it.  A gypsy; I had heard that\ngypsies were great thieves, and I instantly began to fear that the gypsy\nhad stolen the pony, and it is probable that for this apprehension I had\nbetter grounds than for many others.  I instantly ceased to set any value\nupon the pony, but for that reason, perhaps, I turned it to some account;\nI mounted it and rode it about, which I don't think I should have done\nhad I looked upon it as a secure possession.  Had I looked upon my title\nas secure, I should have prized it so much, that I should scarcely have\nmounted it for fear of injuring the animal; but now, caring not a straw\nfor it, I rode it most unmercifully, and soon became a capital rider.\nThis was very selfish in me, and I tell the fact with shame.  I was\npunished, however, as I deserved; the pony had a spirit of its own, and,\nmoreover, it had belonged to gypsies; once, as I was riding it furiously\nover the lawn, applying both whip and spur, it suddenly lifted up its\nheels, and flung me at least five yards over its head.  I received some\ndesperate contusions, and was taken up for dead; it was many months\nbefore I perfectly recovered.\n\n'But it is time for me to come to the touching part of my story.  There\nwas one thing that I loved better than the choicest gift which could be\nbestowed upon me, better than life itself--my mother;--at length she\nbecame unwell, and the thought that I might possibly lose her now rushed\ninto my mind for the first time; it was terrible, and caused me\nunspeakable misery, I may say horror.  My mother became worse, and I was\nnot allowed to enter her apartment, lest by my frantic exclamations of\ngrief I might aggravate her disorder.  I rested neither day nor night,\nbut roamed about the house like one distracted.  Suddenly I found myself\ndoing that which even at the time struck me as being highly singular; I\nfound myself touching particular objects that were near me, and to which\nmy fingers seemed to be attracted by an irresistible impulse.  It was now\nthe table or the chair that I was compelled to touch; now the bell-rope;\nnow the handle of the door; now I would touch the wall, and the next\nmoment, stooping down, I would place the point of my finger upon the\nfloor: and so I continued to do day after day; frequently I would\nstruggle to resist the impulse, but invariably in vain.  I have even\nrushed away from the object, but I was sure to return, the impulse was\ntoo strong to be resisted: I quickly hurried back, compelled by the\nfeeling within me to touch the object.  Now I need not tell you that what\nimpelled me to these actions was the desire to prevent my mother's death;\nwhenever I touched any particular object, it was with the view of\nbaffling the evil chance, as you would call it--in this instance my\nmother's death.\n\n'A favourable crisis occurred in my mother's complaint, and she\nrecovered; this crisis took place about six o'clock in the morning;\nalmost simultaneously with it there happened to myself a rather\nremarkable circumstance connected with the nervous feeling which was\nrioting in my system.  I was lying in bed in a kind of uneasy doze, the\nonly kind of rest which my anxiety on account of my mother permitted me\nat this time to take, when all at once I sprang up as if electrified; the\nmysterious impulse was upon me, and it urged me to go without delay, and\nclimb a stately elm behind the house, and touch the topmost branch;\notherwise--you know the rest--the evil chance would prevail.  Accustomed\nfor some time as I had been, under this impulse, to perform extravagant\nactions, I confess to you that the difficulty and peril of such a feat\nstartled me; I reasoned against the feeling, and strove more strenuously\nthan I had ever done before; I even made a solemn vow not to give way to\nthe temptation, but I believe nothing less than chains, and those strong\nones, could have restrained me.  The demoniac influence, for I can call\nit nothing else, at length prevailed; it compelled me to rise, to dress\nmyself, to descend the stairs, to unbolt the door, and to go forth; it\ndrove me to the foot of the tree, and it compelled me to climb the trunk;\nthis was a tremendous task, and I only accomplished it after repeated\nfalls and trials.  When I had got amongst the branches, I rested for a\ntime, and then set about accomplishing the remainder of the ascent; this\nfor some time was not so difficult, for I was now amongst the branches;\nas I approached the top, however, the difficulty became greater, and\nlikewise the danger; but I was a light boy, and almost as nimble as a\nsquirrel, and, moreover, the nervous feeling was within me, impelling me\nupward.  It was only by means of a spring, however, that I was enabled to\ntouch the top of the tree; I sprang, touched the top of the tree, and\nfell a distance of at least twenty feet, amongst the branches; had I\nfallen to the bottom I must have been killed, but I fell into the middle\nof the tree, and presently found myself astride upon one of the boughs;\nscratched and bruised all over, I reached the ground, and regained my\nchamber unobserved; I flung myself on my bed quite exhausted; presently\nthey came to tell me that my mother was better--they found me in the\nstate which I have described, and in a fever besides.  The favourable\ncrisis must have occurred just about the time that I performed the magic\ntouch; it certainly was a curious coincidence, yet I was not weak enough,\neven though a child, to suppose that I had baffled the evil chance by my\ndaring feat.\n\n'Indeed, all the time that I was performing these strange feats, I knew\nthem to be highly absurd, yet the impulse to perform them was\nirresistible--a mysterious dread hanging over me till I had given way to\nit; even at that early period I frequently used to reason within myself\nas to what could be the cause of my propensity to touch, but of course I\ncould come to no satisfactory conclusion respecting it; being heartily\nashamed of the practice, I never spoke of it to any one, and was at all\ntimes highly solicitous that no one should observe my weakness.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV\n\n\nMaternal anxiety--The baronet--Little zest--Country life--Mr.\nSpeaker!--The craving--Spirited address--An author.\n\nAfter a short pause my host resumed his narration.  'Though I was never\nsent to school, my education was not neglected on that account; I had\ntutors in various branches of knowledge, under whom I made a tolerable\nprogress; by the time I was eighteen I was able to read most of the Greek\nand Latin authors with facility; I was likewise, to a certain degree, a\nmathematician.  I cannot say that I took much pleasure in my studies; my\nchief aim in endeavouring to accomplish my tasks was to give pleasure to\nmy beloved parent, who watched my progress with anxiety truly maternal.\nMy life at this period may be summed up in a few words: I pursued my\nstudies, roamed about the woods, walked the green lanes occasionally,\ncast my fly in a trout stream, and sometimes, but not often, rode\na-hunting with my uncle.  A considerable part of my time was devoted to\nmy mother, conversing with her and reading to her; youthful companions I\nhad none, and as to my mother, she lived in the greatest retirement,\ndevoting herself to the superintendence of my education, and the practice\nof acts of charity; nothing could be more innocent than this mode of\nlife, and some people say that in innocence there is happiness, yet I\ncan't say that I was happy.  A continual dread overshadowed my mind, it\nwas the dread of my mother's death.  Her constitution had never been\nstrong, and it had been considerably shaken by her last illness; this I\nknew, and this I saw--for the eyes of fear are marvellously keen.  Well,\nthings went on in this way till I had come of age; my tutors were then\ndismissed, and my uncle the baronet took me in hand, telling my mother\nthat it was high time for him to exert his authority; that I must see\nsomething of the world, for that, if I remained much longer with her, I\nshould be ruined.  \"You must consign him to me,\" said he, \"and I will\nintroduce him to the world.\"  My mother sighed and consented; so my uncle\nthe baronet introduced me to the world, took me to horse-races and to\nLondon, and endeavoured to make a man of me according to his idea of the\nterm, and in part succeeded.  I became moderately dissipated--I say\nmoderately, for dissipation had but little zest for me.\n\n'In this manner four years passed over.  It happened that I was in London\nin the height of the season with my uncle, at his house; one morning he\nsummoned me into the parlour, he was standing before the fire, and looked\nvery serious.  \"I have had a letter,\" said he; \"your mother is very ill.\"\nI staggered, and touched the nearest object to me; nothing was said for\ntwo or three minutes, and then my uncle put his lips to my ear and\nwhispered something.  I fell down senseless.  My mother was . . . I\nremember nothing for a long time--for two years I was out of my mind; at\nthe end of this time I recovered, or partly so.  My uncle the baronet was\nvery kind to me; he advised me to travel, he offered to go with me.  I\ntold him he was very kind, but I would rather go by myself.  So I went\nabroad, and saw, amongst other things, Rome and the Pyramids.  By\nfrequent change of scene my mind became not happy, but tolerably\ntranquil.  I continued abroad some years, when, becoming tired of\ntravelling, I came home, found my uncle the baronet alive, hearty, and\nunmarried, as he still is.  He received me very kindly, took me to\nNewmarket, and said that he hoped by this time I was become quite a man\nof the world; by his advice I took a house in town, in which I lived\nduring the season.  In summer I strolled from one watering-place to\nanother; and, in order to pass the time, I became very dissipated.\n\n'At last I became as tired of dissipation as I had previously been of\ntravelling, and I determined to retire to the country, and live on my\npaternal estate; this resolution I was not slow in putting into effect; I\nsold my house in town, repaired and refurnished my country house, and,\nfor at least ten years, lived a regular country life; I gave dinner\nparties, prosecuted poachers, was charitable to the poor, and now and\nthen went into my library; during this time I was seldom or never visited\nby the magic impulse, the reason being that there was nothing in the wide\nworld for which I cared sufficiently to move a finger to preserve it.\nWhen the ten years, however, were nearly ended, I started out of bed one\nmorning in a fit of horror, exclaiming, \"Mercy, mercy! what will become\nof me?  I am afraid I shall go mad.  I have lived thirty-five years and\nupwards without doing anything; shall I pass through life in this manner?\nHorror!\"  And then in rapid succession I touched three different objects.\n\n'I dressed myself and went down, determining to set about something; but\nwhat was I to do?--there was the difficulty.  I ate no breakfast, but\nwalked about the room in a state of distraction; at last I thought that\nthe easiest way to do something was to get into Parliament, there would\nbe no difficulty in that.  I had plenty of money, and could buy a seat;\nbut what was I to do in Parliament?  Speak, of course--but could I speak?\n\"I'll try at once,\" said I, and forthwith I rushed into the largest\ndining-room, and, locking the door, I commenced speaking: \"Mr. Speaker,\"\nsaid I, and then I went on speaking for about ten minutes as I best\ncould, and then I left off, for I was talking nonsense.  No, I was not\nformed for Parliament; I could do nothing there.  What--what was I to do?\n\n'Many, many times I thought this question over, but was unable to solve\nit; a fear now stole over me that I was unfit for anything in the world,\nsave the lazy life of vegetation which I had for many years been leading;\nyet, if that were the case, thought I, why the craving within me to\ndistinguish myself?  Surely it does not occur fortuitously, but is\nintended to rouse and call into exercise certain latent powers that I\npossess? and then with infinite eagerness I set about attempting to\ndiscover these latent powers.  I tried an infinity of pursuits, botany\nand geology amongst the rest, but in vain; I was fitted for none of them.\nI became very sorrowful and despondent, and at one time I had almost\nresolved to plunge again into the whirlpool of dissipation; it was a\ndreadful resource, it was true, but what better could I do?\n\n'But I was not doomed to return to the dissipation of the world.  One\nmorning a young nobleman, who had for some time past showed a wish to\ncultivate my acquaintance, came to me in a considerable hurry.  \"I am\ncome to beg an important favour of you,\" said he; \"one of the county\nmemberships is vacant--I intend to become a candidate; what I want\nimmediately is a spirited address to the electors.  I have been\nendeavouring to frame one all the morning, but in vain; I have,\ntherefore, recourse to you as a person of infinite genius; pray, my dear\nfriend, concoct me one by the morning!\"  \"What you require of me,\" I\nreplied, \"is impossible; I have not the gift of words; did I possess it I\nwould stand for the county myself, but I can't speak.  Only the other day\nI attempted to make a speech, but left off suddenly, utterly ashamed,\nalthough I was quite alone, of the nonsense I was uttering.\"  \"It is not\na speech that I want,\" said my friend; \"I can talk for three hours\nwithout hesitating, but I want an address to circulate through the\ncounty, and I find myself utterly incompetent to put one together; do\noblige me by writing one for me, I know you can; and, if at any time you\nwant a person to speak for you, you may command me not for three but for\nsix hours.  Good-morning; to-morrow I will breakfast with you.\"  In the\nmorning he came again.  \"Well,\" said he, \"what success?\"  \"Very poor,\"\nsaid I; \"but judge for yourself\"; and I put into his hand a manuscript of\nseveral pages.  My friend read it through with considerable attention.  \"I\ncongratulate you,\" said he, \"and likewise myself; I was not mistaken in\nmy opinion of you; the address is too long by at least two-thirds, or I\nshould rather say, that it is longer by two-thirds than addresses\ngenerally are; but it will do--I will not curtail it of a word.  I shall\nwin my election.\"  And in truth he did win his election; and it was not\nonly his own but the general opinion that he owed it to the address.\n\n'But, however that might be, I had, by writing the address, at last\ndiscovered what had so long eluded my search--what I was able to do.  I,\nwho had neither the nerve nor the command of speech necessary to\nconstitute the orator--who had not the power of patient research required\nby those who would investigate the secrets of nature, had, nevertheless,\na ready pen and teeming imagination.  This discovery decided my fate--from\nthat moment I became an author.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI\n\n\nTrepidations--Subtle principle--Perverse imagination--Are they\nmine?--Another book--How hard!--Agricultural dinner--Incomprehensible\nactions--Inmost bosom--Give it up--Chance resemblance--Rascally\nnewspaper.\n\n'An author,' said I, addressing my host; 'is it possible that I am under\nthe roof of an author?'\n\n'Yes,' said my host, sighing, 'my name is so and so, and I am the author\nof so and so; it is more than probable that you have heard both of my\nname and works.  I will not detain you much longer with my history; the\nnight is advancing, and the storm appears to be upon the increase.  My\nlife since the period of my becoming an author may be summed briefly as\nan almost uninterrupted series of doubts, anxieties, and trepidations.  I\nsee clearly that it is not good to love anything immoderately in this\nworld, but it has been my misfortune to love immoderately everything on\nwhich I have set my heart.  This is not good, I repeat--but where is the\nremedy?  The ancients were always in the habit of saying, \"Practise\nmoderation,\" but the ancients appear to have considered only one portion\nof the subject.  It is very possible to practise moderation in some\nthings, in drink and the like--to restrain the appetites--but can a man\nrestrain the affections of his mind, and tell them, so far you shall go,\nand no farther?  Alas, no! for the mind is a subtle principle, and cannot\nbe confined.  The winds may be imprisoned; Homer says that Odysseus\ncarried certain winds in his ship, confined in leathern bags, but Homer\nnever speaks of confining the affections.  It were but right that those\nwho exhort us against inordinate affections, and setting our hearts too\nmuch upon the world and its vanities, would tell us how to avoid doing\nso.\n\n'I need scarcely tell you that no sooner did I become an author than I\ngave myself up immoderately to my vocation.  It became my idol, and, as a\nnecessary consequence, it has proved a source of misery and disquietude\nto me, instead of pleasure and blessing.  I had trouble enough in writing\nmy first work, and I was not long in discovering that it was one thing to\nwrite a stirring and spirited address to a set of county electors, and\nanother widely different to produce a work at all calculated to make an\nimpression upon the great world.  I felt, however, that I was in my\nproper sphere, and by dint of unwearied diligence and exertion I\nsucceeded in evolving from the depths of my agitated breast a work which,\nthough it did not exactly please me, I thought would serve to make an\nexperiment upon the public; so I laid it before the public, and the\nreception which it met with was far beyond my wildest expectations.  The\npublic were delighted with it, but what were my feelings?  Anything,\nalas! but those of delight.  No sooner did the public express its\nsatisfaction at the result of my endeavours, than my perverse imagination\nbegan to conceive a thousand chimerical doubts; forthwith I sat down to\nanalyse it; and my worst enemy, and all people have their enemies,\nespecially authors--my worst enemy could not have discovered or sought to\ndiscover a tenth part of the faults which I, the author and creator of\nthe unfortunate production, found or sought to find in it.  It has been\nsaid that love makes us blind to the faults of the loved object--common\nlove does, perhaps--the love of a father to his child, or that of a lover\nto his mistress, but not the inordinate love of an author to his works,\nat least not the love which one like myself bears to his works: to be\nbrief, I discovered a thousand faults in my work, which neither public\nnor critics discovered.  However, I was beginning to get over this\nmisery, and to forgive my work all its imperfections, when--and I shake\nwhen I mention it--the same kind of idea which perplexed me with regard\nto the hawks and the gypsy pony rushed into my mind, and I forthwith\ncommenced touching the objects around me, in order to baffle the evil\nchance, as you call it; it was neither more nor less than a doubt of the\nlegality of my claim to the thoughts, expressions, and situations\ncontained in the book; that is, to all that constituted the book.  How\ndid I get them?  How did they come into my mind?  Did I invent them?  Did\nthey originate with myself?  Are they my own, or are they some other\nbody's?  You see into what difficulty I had got; I won't trouble you by\nrelating all that I endured at that time, but will merely say that after\neating my own heart, as the Italians say, and touching every object that\ncame in my way for six months, I at length flung my book, I mean the copy\nof it which I possessed, into the fire, and began another.\n\n'But it was all in vain; I laboured at this other, finished it, and gave\nit to the world; and no sooner had I done so, than the same thought was\nbusy in my brain, poisoning all the pleasure which I should otherwise\nhave derived from my work.  How did I get all the matter which composed\nit?  Out of my own mind, unquestionably; but how did it come there--was\nit the indigenous growth of the mind?  And then I would sit down and\nponder over the various scenes and adventures in my book, endeavouring to\nascertain how I came originally to devise them, and by dint of reflecting\nI remembered that to a single word in conversation, or some simple\naccident in a street or on a road, I was indebted for some of the\nhappiest portions of my work; they were but tiny seeds, it is true, which\nin the soil of my imagination had subsequently become stately trees, but\nI reflected that without them no stately trees would have been produced,\nand that, consequently, only a part in the merit of these compositions\nwhich charmed the world--for the did charm the world--was due to myself.\nThus, a dead fly was in my phial, poisoning all the pleasure which I\nshould otherwise have derived from the result of my brain-sweat.  \"How\nhard!\" I would exclaim, looking up to the sky, \"how hard!  I am like\nVirgil's sheep, bearing fleeces not for themselves.\"  But, not to tire\nyou, it fared with my second work as it did with my first; I flung it\naside, and, in order to forget it, I began a third, on which I am now\noccupied; but the difficulty of writing it is immense, my extreme desire\nto be original sadly cramping the powers of my mind; my fastidiousness\nbeing so great that I invariably reject whatever ideas I do not think to\nbe legitimately my own.  But there is one circumstance to which I cannot\nhelp alluding here, as it serves to show what miseries this love of\noriginality must needs bring upon an author.  I am constantly discovering\nthat, however original I may wish to be, I am continually producing the\nsame things which other people say or write.  Whenever, after producing\nsomething which gives me perfect satisfaction, and which has cost me\nperhaps days and nights of brooding, I chance to take up a book for the\nsake of a little relaxation, a book which I never saw before, I am sure\nto find in it something more or less resembling some part of what I have\nbeen just composing.  You will easily conceive the distress which then\ncomes over me; 'tis then that I am almost tempted to execrate the chance\nwhich, by discovering my latent powers, induced me to adopt a profession\nof such anxiety and misery.\n\n'For some time past I have given up reading almost entirely, owing to the\ndread which I entertain of lighting upon something similar to what I\nmyself have written.  I scarcely ever transgress without having almost\ninstant reason to repent.  To-day, when I took up the newspaper, I saw in\na speech of the Duke of Rhododendron, at an agricultural dinner, the very\nsame ideas, and almost the same expressions which I had put into the\nmouth of an imaginary personage of mine, on a widely different occasion;\nyou saw how I dashed the newspaper down--you saw how I touched the floor;\nthe touch was to baffle the evil chance, to prevent the critics detecting\nany similarity between the speech of the Duke of Rhododendron at the\nagricultural dinner and the speech of my personage.  My sensibility on\nthe subject of my writings is so great that sometimes a chance word is\nsufficient to unman me, I apply it to them in a superstitious sense; for\nexample, when you said some time ago that the dark hour was coming on, I\napplied it to my works--it appeared to bode them evil fortune; you saw\nhow I touched, it was to baffle the evil chance; but I do not confine\nmyself to touching when the fear of the evil chance is upon me.  To\nbaffle it I occasionally perform actions which must appear highly\nincomprehensible; I have been known, when riding in company with other\npeople, to leave the direct road, and make a long circuit by a miry lane\nto the place to which we were going.  I have also been seen attempting to\nride across a morass, where I had no business whatever, and in which my\nhorse finally sank up to its saddle-girths, and was only extricated by\nthe help of a multitude of hands.  I have, of course, frequently been\nasked the reason of such conduct, to which I have invariably returned no\nanswer, for I scorn duplicity; whereupon people have looked mysteriously,\nand sometimes put their fingers to their foreheads.  \"And yet it can't\nbe,\" I once heard an old gentleman say; \"don't we know what he is capable\nof?\" and the old man was right; I merely did these things to avoid the\nevil chance, impelled by the strange feeling within me; and this evil\nchance is invariably connected with my writings, the only things at\npresent which render life valuable to me.  If I touch various objects,\nand ride into miry places, it is to baffle any mischance befalling me as\nan author, to prevent my books getting into disrepute; in nine cases out\nof ten to prevent any expressions, thoughts, or situations in any work\nwhich I am writing from resembling the thoughts, expressions, and\nsituations of other authors, for my great wish, as I told you before, is\nto be original.\n\n'I have now related my history, and have revealed to you the secrets of\nmy inmost bosom.  I should certainly not have spoken so unreservedly as I\nhave done, had I not discovered in you a kindred spirit.  I have long\nwished for an opportunity of discoursing on the point which forms the\npeculiar feature of my history with a being who could understand me; and\ntruly it was a lucky chance which brought you to these parts; you who\nseem to be acquainted with all things strange and singular, and who are\nas well acquainted with the subject of the magic touch as with all that\nrelates to the star Jupiter or the mysterious tree at Upsal.'\n\nSuch was the story which my host related to me in the library, amidst the\ndarkness, occasionally broken by flashes of lightning.  Both of us\nremained silent for some time after it was concluded.\n\n'It is a singular story,' said I, at last, 'though I confess that I was\nprepared for some part of it.  Will you permit me to ask you a question?'\n\n'Certainly,' said my host.\n\n'Did you never speak in public?' said I.\n\n'Never.'\n\n'And when you made this speech of yours in the dining-room, commencing\nwith Mr. Speaker, no one was present?'\n\n'None in the world, I double-locked the door; what do you mean?'\n\n'An idea came into my head--dear me how the rain is pouring--but, with\nrespect to your present troubles and anxieties, would it not be wise,\nseeing that authorship causes you so much trouble and anxiety, to give it\nup altogether?'\n\n'Were you an author yourself,' replied my host, 'you would not talk in\nthis manner; once an author, ever an author--besides, what could I do?\nreturn to my former state of vegetation? no, much as I endure, I do not\nwish that; besides, every now and then my reason tells me that these\ntroubles and anxieties of mine are utterly without; foundation that\nwhatever I write is the legitimate growth of my own mind, and that it is\nthe height of folly to afflict myself at any chance resemblance between\nmy own thoughts and those of other writers, such resemblance being\ninevitable from the fact of our common human origin.  In short--'\n\n'I understand you,' said I; 'notwithstanding your troubles and anxieties\nyou find life very tolerable; has your originality ever been called in\nquestion?'\n\n'On the contrary, every one declares that originality constitutes the\nmost remarkable feature of my writings; the man has some faults, they\nsay, but want of originality is certainly not one of them.  He is quite\ndifferent from others--a certain newspaper, it is true, the--I think,\nonce insinuated that in a certain work of mine I had taken a hint or two\nfrom the writings of a couple of authors which it mentioned; it happened,\nhowever, that I had never even read one syllable of the writings of\neither, and of one of them had never even heard the name; so much for the\ndiscrimination of the ---.  By the bye, what a rascally newspaper that\nis!'\n\n'A very rascally newspaper,' said I.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII\n\n\nDisturbed slumbers--The bed-post--Two wizards--What can I do?--Real\nlibrary--The Rev. Mr. Platitude--Toleration to Dissenters--Paradox--Sword\nof St. Peter--Enemy to humbug--High principles--False concord--The\ndamsel--What religion?--Further conversation--That would never do!--May\nyou prosper.\n\nDuring the greater part of that night my slumbers were disturbed by\nstrange dreams.  Amongst other things, I fancied that I was my host; my\nhead appeared to be teeming with wild thoughts and imaginations, out of\nwhich I was endeavouring to frame a book.  And now the book was finished\nand given to the world, and the world shouted; and all eyes were turned\nupon me, and I shrank from the eyes of the world.  And, when I got into\nretired places, I touched various objects in order to baffle the evil\nchance.  In short, during the whole night, I was acting over the story\nwhich I had heard before I went to bed.\n\nAt about eight o'clock I awoke.  The storm had long since passed away,\nand the morning was bright and shining; my couch was so soft and\nluxurious that I felt loth to quit it, so I lay some time, my eyes\nwandering about the magnificent room to which fortune had conducted me in\nso singular a manner; at last I heaved a sigh; I was thinking of my own\nhomeless condition, and imagining where I should find myself on the\nfollowing morning.  Unwilling, however, to indulge in melancholy\nthoughts, I sprang out of bed and proceeded to dress myself, and, whilst\ndressing, I felt an irresistible inclination to touch the bed-post.\n\nI finished dressing and left the room, feeling compelled, however, as I\nleft it, to touch the lintel of the door.  Is it possible, thought I,\nthat from what I have lately heard the long-forgotten influence should\nhave possessed me again? but I will not give way to it; so I hurried\ndownstairs, resisting as I went a certain inclination which I\noccasionally felt to touch the rail of the banister.  I was presently\nupon the gravel walk before the house: it was indeed a glorious morning.\nI stood for some time observing the golden fish disporting in the waters\nof the pond, and then strolled about amongst the noble trees of the park;\nthe beauty and freshness of the morning--for the air had been\nconsiderably cooled by the late storm--soon enabled me to cast away the\ngloomy ideas which had previously taken possession of my mind, and, after\na stroll of about half an hour, I returned towards the house in high\nspirits.  It is true that once I felt very much inclined to go and touch\nthe leaves of a flowery shrub which I saw at some distance, and had even\nmoved two or three paces towards it; but, bethinking myself, I manfully\nresisted the temptation.  'Begone!' I exclaimed, 'ye sorceries, in which\nI formerly trusted--begone for ever vagaries which I had almost\nforgotten; good luck is not to be obtained, or bad averted, by magic\ntouches; besides, two wizards in one parish would be too much, in all\nconscience.'\n\nI returned to the house, and entered the library; breakfast was laid on\nthe table, and my friend was standing before the portrait which I have\nalready said hung above the mantelpiece; so intently was he occupied in\ngazing at it that he did not hear me enter, nor was aware of my presence\ntill I advanced close to him and spoke, when he turned round and shook me\nby the hand.\n\n'What can possibly have induced you to hang up that portrait in your\nlibrary? it is a staring likeness, it is true, but it appears to me a\nwretched daub.'\n\n'Daub as you call it,' said my friend, smiling, 'I would not part with it\nfor the best piece of Rafael.  For many a happy thought I am indebted to\nthat picture--it is my principal source of inspiration; when my\nimagination flags, as of course it occasionally does, I stare upon those\nfeatures, and forthwith strange ideas of fun and drollery begin to flow\ninto my mind; these I round, amplify, or combine into goodly creations,\nand bring forth as I find an opportunity.  It is true that I am\noccasionally tormented by the thought that, by doing this, I am\ncommitting plagiarism; though, in that case, all thoughts must be\nplagiarisms, all that we think being the result of what we hear, see, or\nfeel.  What can I do?  I must derive my thoughts from some source or\nother; and, after all, it is better to plagiarise from the features of my\nlandlord than from the works of Butler and Cervantes.  My works, as you\nare aware, are of a serio-comic character.  My neighbours are of opinion\nthat I am a great reader, and so I am, but only of those features--my\nreal library is that picture.'\n\n'But how did you obtain it?' said I.\n\n'Some years ago a travelling painter came into this neighbourhood, and my\njolly host, at the request of his wife, consented to sit for his\nportrait; she highly admired the picture, but she soon died, and then my\nfat friend, who is of an affectionate disposition, said he could not bear\nthe sight of it, as it put him in mind of his poor wife.  I purchased it\nof him for five pounds--I would not take five thousand for it; when you\ncalled that picture a daub, you did not see all the poetry of it.'\n\nWe sat down to breakfast; my entertainer appeared to be in much better\nspirits than on the preceding day; I did not observe him touch once; ere\nbreakfast was over a servant entered--'The Reverend Mr. Platitude, sir,'\nsaid he.\n\nA shade of dissatisfaction came over the countenance of my host.  'What\ndoes the silly pestilent fellow mean by coming here?' said he, half to\nhimself; 'let him come in,' said he to the servant.\n\nThe servant went out, and in a moment reappeared, introducing the\nReverend Mr. Platitude.  The Reverend Mr. Platitude, having what is\nvulgarly called a game leg, came shambling into the room; he was about\nthirty years of age, and about five feet three inches high; his face was\nof the colour of pepper, and nearly as rugged as a nutmeg-grater; his\nhair was black; with his eyes he squinted, and grinned with his lips,\nwhich were very much apart, disclosing two very irregular rows of teeth;\nhe was dressed in the true Levitical fashion, in a suit of spotless\nblack, and a neckerchief of spotless white.\n\nThe Reverend Mr. Platitude advanced winking and grinning to my\nentertainer, who received him politely but with evident coldness; nothing\ndaunted, however, the Reverend Mr. Platitude took a seat by the table,\nand, being asked to take a cup of coffee, winked, grinned, and consented.\n\nIn company I am occasionally subject to fits of what is generally called\nabsence; my mind takes flight and returns to former scenes, or presses\nforward into the future.  One of these fits of absence came over me at\nthis time--I looked at the Reverend Mr. Platitude for a moment, heard a\nword or two that proceeded from his mouth, and saying to myself, 'You are\nno man for me,' fell into a fit of musing--into the same train of thought\nas in the morning, no very pleasant one--I was thinking of the future.\n\nI continued in my reverie for some time, and probably should have\ncontinued longer, had I not been suddenly aroused by the voice of Mr.\nPlatitude raised to a very high key.  'Yes, my dear sir,' said he, 'it is\nbut too true; I have it on good authority--a gone church--a lost church--a\nruined church--a demolished church is the Church of England.  Toleration\nto Dissenters!--oh, monstrous!'\n\n'I suppose,' said my host, 'that the repeal of the Test Acts will be\nmerely a precursor of the emancipation of the Papists?'\n\n'Of the Catholics,' said the Reverend Mr. Platitude.  'Ahem.  There was a\ntime, as I believe you are aware, my dear sir, when I was as much opposed\nto the emancipation of the Catholics as it was possible for any one to\nbe; but I was prejudiced, my dear sir, labouring under a cloud of most\nunfortunate prejudice; but I thank my Maker I am so no longer.  I have\ntravelled, as you are aware.  It is only by travelling that one can rub\noff prejudices; I think you will agree with me there.  I am speaking to a\ntraveller.  I left behind all my prejudices in Italy.  The Catholics are\nat least our fellow-Christians.  I thank Heaven that I am no longer an\nenemy to Catholic emancipation.'\n\n'And yet you would not tolerate Dissenters?'\n\n'Dissenters, my dear sir; I hope you would not class such a set as the\nDissenters with Catholics?'\n\n'Perhaps it would be unjust,' said my host, 'though to which of the two\nparties is another thing; but permit me to ask you a question: Does it\nnot smack somewhat of paradox to talk of Catholics, whilst you admit\nthere are Dissenters?  If there are Dissenters, how should there be\nCatholics?'\n\n'It is not my fault that there are Dissenters,' said the Reverend Mr.\nPlatitude; 'if I had my will I would neither admit there were any, nor\npermit any to be.'\n\n'Of course you would admit there were such as long as they existed; but\nhow would you get rid of them?'\n\n'I would have the Church exert its authority.'\n\n'What do you mean by exerting its authority?'\n\n'I would not have the Church bear the sword in vain.'\n\n'What, the sword of St. Peter?  You remember what the founder of the\nreligion which you profess said about the sword, \"He who striketh with it\n. . . \"  I think those who have called themselves the Church have had\nenough of the sword.  Two can play with the sword, Mr. Platitude.  The\nChurch of Rome tried the sword with the Lutherans: how did it fare with\nthe Church of Rome?  The Church of England tried the sword, Mr.\nPlatitude, with the Puritans: how did it fare with Laud and Charles?'\n\n'Oh, as for the Church of England,' said Mr. Platitude, 'I have little to\nsay.  Thank God, I left all my Church of England prejudices in Italy.  Had\nthe Church of England known its true interests, it would long ago have\nsought a reconciliation with its illustrious mother.  If the Church of\nEngland had not been in some degree a schismatic church, it would not\nhave fared so ill at the time of which you are speaking; the rest of the\nChurch would have come to its assistance.  The Irish would have helped\nit, so would the French, so would the Portuguese.  Disunion has always\nbeen the bane of the Church.'\n\nOnce more I fell into a reverie.  My mind now reverted to the past;\nmethought I was in a small comfortable room wainscoted with oak; I was\nseated on one side of a fireplace, close by a table on which were wine\nand fruit; on the other side of the fire sat a man in a plain suit of\nbrown, with the hair combed back from his somewhat high forehead; he had\na pipe in his mouth, which for some time he smoked gravely and placidly,\nwithout saying a word; at length, after drawing at the pipe for some time\nrather vigorously, he removed it from his mouth, and, emitting an\naccumulated cloud of smoke, he exclaimed in a slow and measured tone, 'As\nI was telling you just now, my good chap, I have always been an enemy to\nhumbug.'\n\nWhen I awoke from my reverie the Reverend Mr. Platitude was quitting the\napartment.\n\n'Who is that person?' said I to my entertainer, as the door closed behind\nhim.\n\n'Who is he?' said my host; 'why, the Reverend Mr. Platitude.'\n\n'Does he reside in this neighbourhood?'\n\n'He holds a living about three miles from here; his history, as far as I\nam acquainted with it, is as follows.  His father was a respectable\ntanner in the neighbouring town, who, wishing to make his son a\ngentleman, sent him to college.  Having never been at college myself, I\ncannot say whether he took the wisest course; I believe it is more easy\nto unmake than to make a gentleman; I have known many gentlemanly youths\ngo to college, and return anything but what they went.  Young Mr.\nPlatitude did not go to college a gentleman, but neither did he return\none: he went to college an ass, and returned a prig; to his original\nfolly was superadded a vast quantity of conceit.  He told his father that\nhe had adopted high principles, and was determined to discountenance\neverything low and mean; advised him to eschew trade, and to purchase him\na living.  The old man retired from business, purchased his son a living,\nand shortly after died, leaving him what remained of his fortune.  The\nfirst thing the Reverend Mr. Platitude did, after his father's decease,\nwas to send his mother and sister into Wales to live upon a small\nannuity, assigning as a reason that he was averse to anything low, and\nthat they talked ungrammatically.  Wishing to shine in the pulpit, he now\npreached high sermons, as he called them, interspersed with scraps of\nlearning.  His sermons did not, however, procure him much popularity; on\nthe contrary, his church soon became nearly deserted, the greater part of\nhis flock going over to certain dissenting preachers, who had shortly\nbefore made their appearance in the neighbourhood.  Mr. Platitude was\nfilled with wrath, and abused Dissenters in most unmeasured terms.  Coming\nin contact with some of the preachers at a public meeting, he was rash\nenough to enter into argument with them.  Poor Platitude! he had better\nhave been quiet, he appeared like a child, a very infant, in their grasp;\nhe attempted to take shelter under his college learning, but found, to\nhis dismay, that his opponents knew more Greek and Latin than himself.\nThese illiterate boors, as he had supposed them, caught him at once in a\nfalse concord, and Mr. Platitude had to slink home overwhelmed with\nshame.  To avenge himself he applied to the ecclesiastical court, but was\ntold that the Dissenters could not be put down by the present\necclesiastical law.  He found the Church of England, to use his own\nexpression, a poor, powerless, restricted Church.  He now thought to\nimprove his consequence by marriage, and made up to a rich and beautiful\nyoung lady in the neighbourhood; the damsel measured him from head to\nfoot with a pair of very sharp eyes, dropped a curtsey, and refused him.\nMr. Platitude, finding England a very stupid place, determined to travel;\nhe went to Italy; how he passed his time there he knows best, to other\npeople it is a matter of little importance.  At the end of two years he\nreturned with a real or assumed contempt for everything English, and\nespecially for the Church to which he belongs, and out of which he is\nsupported.  He forthwith gave out that he had left behind him all his\nChurch of England prejudices, and, as a proof thereof, spoke against\nsacerdotal wedlock and the toleration of schismatics.  In an evil hour\nfor myself he was introduced to me by a clergyman of my acquaintance, and\nfrom that time I have been pestered, as I was this morning, at least once\na week.  I seldom enter into any discussion with him, but fix my eyes on\nthe portrait over the mantelpiece, and endeavour to conjure up some comic\nidea or situation, whilst he goes on talking tomfoolery by the hour about\nChurch authority, schismatics, and the unlawfulness of sacerdotal\nwedlock; occasionally he brings with him a strange kind of being, whose\nacquaintance he says he made in Italy; I believe he is some sharking\npriest who has come over to proselytise and plunder.  This being has some\npowers of conversation and some learning, but carries the countenance of\nan arch villain; Platitude is evidently his tool.'\n\n'Of what religion are you?' said I to my host.\n\n'That of the Vicar of Wakefield--good, quiet, Church of England, which\nwould live and let live, practises charity, and rails at no one; where\nthe priest is the husband of one wife, takes care of his family and his\nparish--such is the religion for me, though I confess I have hitherto\nthought too little of religious matters.  When, however, I have completed\nthis plaguy work on which I am engaged, I hope to be able to devote more\nattention to them.'\n\nAfter some further conversation, the subjects being, if I remember right,\ncollege education, priggism, church authority, tomfoolery, and the like,\nI rose and said to my host, 'I must now leave you.'\n\n'Whither are you going?'\n\n'I do not know.'\n\n'Stay here, then--you shall be welcome as many days, months, and years as\nyou please to stay.'\n\n'Do you think I would hang upon another man?  No, not if he were Emperor\nof all the Chinas.  I will now make my preparations, and then bid you\nfarewell.'\n\nI retired to my apartment and collected the handful of things which I\ncarried with me on my travels.\n\n'I will walk a little way with you,' said my friend on my return.\n\nHe walked with me to the park gate; neither of us said anything by the\nway.  When we had come upon the road, I said, 'Farewell now; I will not\npermit you to give yourself any further trouble on my account.  Receive\nmy best thanks for your kindness; before we part, however, I should wish\nto ask you a question.  Do you think you shall ever grow tired of\nauthorship?'\n\n'I have my fears,' said my friend, advancing his hand to one of the iron\nbars of the gate.\n\n'Don't touch,' said I, 'it is a bad habit.  I have but one word to add:\nshould you ever grow tired of authorship follow your first idea of\ngetting into Parliament; you have words enough at command; perhaps you\nwant manner and method; but, in that case, you must apply to a teacher,\nyou must take lessons of a master of elocution.'\n\n'That would never do!' said my host; 'I know myself too well to think of\napplying for assistance to any one.  Were I to become a parliamentary\norator, I should wish to be an original one, even if not above\nmediocrity.  What pleasure should I take in any speech I might make,\nhowever original as to thought, provided the gestures I employed and the\nvery modulation of my voice were not my own?  Take lessons, indeed! why,\nthe fellow who taught me, the professor, might be standing in the gallery\nwhilst I spoke; and, at the best parts of my speech, might say to\nhimself, \"That gesture is mine--that modulation is mine.\"  I could not\nbear the thought of such a thing.'\n\n'Farewell,' said I, 'and may you prosper.  I have nothing more to say.'\n\nI departed.  At the distance of twenty yards I turned round suddenly; my\nfriend was just withdrawing his finger from the bar of the gate.\n\n{picture:My friend was just withdrawing his finger from the bar of the\ngate: page369.jpg}\n\n'He has been touching,' said I, as I proceeded on my way; 'I wonder what\nwas the evil chance he wished to baffle.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII\n\n\nElastic step--Disconsolate party--Not the season--Mend your draught--Good\nale--Crotchet--Hammer and tongs--Schoolmaster--True Eden life--Flaming\nTinman--Twice my size--Hard at work--My poor wife--Grey Moll--A\nBible--Half-and-half--What to do--Half inclined--In no time--On one\ncondition--Don't stare--Like the wind.\n\nAfter walking some time, I found myself on the great road, at the same\nspot where I had turned aside the day before with my new-made\nacquaintance, in the direction of his house.  I now continued my journey\nas before, towards the north.  The weather, though beautiful, was much\ncooler than it had been for some time past; I walked at a great rate,\nwith a springing and elastic step.  In about two hours I came to where a\nkind of cottage stood a little way back from the road, with a huge oak\nbefore it, under the shade of which stood a little pony and a cart, which\nseemed to contain various articles.  I was going past--when I saw\nscrawled over the door of the cottage, 'Good beer sold here'; upon which,\nfeeling myself all of a sudden very thirsty, I determined to go in and\ntaste the beverage.\n\n{picture:I was going past--when I saw scrawled over the door of the\ncottage, 'Good beer sold here.': page371.jpg}\n\nI entered a well-sanded kitchen, and seated myself on a bench, on one\nside of a long white table; the other side, which was nearest to the\nwall, was occupied by a party, or rather family, consisting of a grimy-\nlooking man, somewhat under the middle size, dressed in faded velveteens,\nand wearing a leather apron--a rather pretty-looking woman, but\nsun-burnt, and meanly dressed, and two ragged children, a boy and girl,\nabout four or five years old.  The man sat with his eyes fixed upon the\ntable, supporting his chin with both his hands; the woman, who was next\nhim, sat quite still, save that occasionally she turned a glance upon her\nhusband with eyes that appeared to have been lately crying.  The children\nhad none of the vivacity so general at their age.  A more disconsolate\nfamily I had never seen; a mug, which, when filled, might contain half a\npint, stood empty before them; a very disconsolate party indeed.\n\n'House!' said I; 'House!' and then, as nobody appeared, I cried again as\nloud as I could, 'House! do you hear me, House!'\n\n'What's your pleasure, young man?' said an elderly woman, who now made\nher appearance from a side apartment.\n\n'To taste your ale,' said I.\n\n'How much?' said the woman, stretching out her hand towards the empty mug\nupon the table.\n\n'The largest measure-full in your house,' said I, putting back her hand\ngently.  'This is not the season for half-pint mugs.'\n\n'As you will, young man,' said the landlady; and presently brought in an\nearthen pitcher which might contain about three pints, and which foamed\nand frothed withal.\n\n'Will this pay for it?' said I, putting down sixpence.\n\n{picture:'Will this pay for it?' said I, putting down sixpence:\npage373.jpg}\n\n'I have to return you a penny,' said the landlady, putting her hand into\nher pocket.\n\n'I want no change,' said I, flourishing my hand with an air.\n\n'As you please, young gentleman,' said the landlady, and then, making a\nkind of curtsey, she again retired to the side apartment.\n\n'Here is your health, sir,' said I to the grimy-looking man, as I raised\nthe pitcher to my lips.\n\nThe tinker, for such I supposed him to be, without altering his posture,\nraised his eyes, looked at me for a moment, gave a slight nod, and then\nonce more fixed his eyes upon the table.  I took a draught of the ale,\nwhich I found excellent; 'Won't you drink?' said I, holding the pitcher\nto the tinker.\n\nThe man again lifted up his eyes, looked at me, and then at the pitcher,\nand then at me again.  I thought at one time that he was about to shake\nhis head in sign of refusal; but no, he looked once more at the pitcher,\nand the temptation was too strong.  Slowly removing his head from his\narms, he took the pitcher, sighed, nodded, and drank a tolerable\nquantity, and then set the pitcher down before me upon the table.\n\n'You had better mend your draught,' said I to the tinker; 'it is a sad\nheart that never rejoices.'\n\n'That's true,' said the tinker, and again raising the pitcher to his\nlips, he mended his draught as I had bidden him, drinking a larger\nquantity than before.\n\n'Pass it to your wife,' said I.\n\nThe poor woman took the pitcher from the man's hand; before, however,\nraising it to her lips, she looked at the children.  True mother's heart,\nthought I to myself, and taking the half-pint mug, I made her fill it,\nand then held it to the children, causing each to take a draught.  The\nwoman wiped her eyes with the corner of her gown, before she raised the\npitcher and drank to my health.\n\nIn about five minutes none of the family looked half so disconsolate as\nbefore, and the tinker and I were in deep discourse.\n\nOh, genial and gladdening is the power of good ale, the true and proper\ndrink of Englishmen.  He is not deserving of the name of Englishman who\nspeaketh against ale, that is good ale, like that which has just made\nmerry the hearts of this poor family; and yet there are beings, calling\nthemselves Englishmen, who say that it is a sin to drink a cup of ale,\nand who, on coming to this passage will be tempted to fling down the book\nand exclaim, 'The man is evidently a bad man, for behold, by his own\nconfession, he is not only fond of ale himself, but is in the habit of\ntempting other people with it.'  Alas! alas! what a number of silly\nindividuals there are in this world; I wonder what they would have had me\ndo in this instance--given the afflicted family a cup of cold water? go\nto!  They could have found water in the road, for there was a pellucid\nspring only a few yards distant from the house, as they were well\naware--but they wanted not water; what should I have given them? meat and\nbread? go to!  They were not hungry; there was stifled sobbing in their\nbosoms, and the first mouthful of strong meat would have choked them.\nWhat should I have given them?  Money! what right had I to insult them by\noffering them money?  Advice! words, words, words; friends, there is a\ntime for everything; there is a time for a cup of cold water; there is a\ntime for strong meat and bread; there is a time for advice, and there is\na time for ale; and I have generally found that the time for advice is\nafter a cup of ale.  I do not say many cups; the tongue then speaketh\nmore smoothly, and the ear listeneth more benignantly; but why do I\nattempt to reason with you? do I not know you for conceited creatures,\nwith one idea--and that a foolish one;--a crotchet, for the sake of which\nye would sacrifice anything, religion if required--country?  There, fling\ndown my book, I do not wish ye to walk any farther in my company, unless\nyou cast your nonsense away, which ye will never do, for it is the breath\nof your nostrils; fling down my book, it was not written to support a\ncrotchet, for know one thing, my good people, I have invariably been an\nenemy to humbug.\n\n'Well,' said the tinker, after we had discoursed some time, 'little\nthought, when I first saw you, that you were of my own trade.'\n\n_Myself_.  Nor am I, at least not exactly.  There is not much difference,\n'tis true, between a tinker and a smith.\n\n_Tinker_.  You are a whitesmith then?\n\n_Myself_.  Not I, I'd scorn to be anything so mean; no, friend, black's\nthe colour; I am a brother of the horse-shoe.  Success to the hammer and\ntongs.\n\n_Tinker_.  Well, I shouldn't have thought you had been a blacksmith by\nyour hands.\n\n_Myself_.  I have seen them, however, as black as yours.  The truth is, I\nhave not worked for many a day.\n\n_Tinker_.  Where did you serve first?\n\n_Myself_.  In Ireland.\n\n_Tinker_. That's a good way off, isn't it?\n\n_Myself_.  Not very far; over those mountains to the left, and the run of\nsalt water that lies behind them, there's Ireland.\n\n_Tinker_.  It's a fine thing to be a scholar.\n\n_Myself_.  Not half so fine as to be a tinker.\n\n_Tinker_.  How you talk!\n\n_Myself_.  Nothing but the truth; what can be better than to be one's own\nmaster?  Now a tinker is his own master, a scholar is not.  Let us\nsuppose the best of scholars, a schoolmaster for example, for I suppose\nyou will admit that no one can be higher in scholarship than a\nschoolmaster; do you call his a pleasant life?  I don't; we should call\nhim a school-slave, rather than a schoolmaster.  Only conceive him in\nblessed weather like this, in his close school, teaching children to\nwrite in copy-books, 'Evil communication corrupts good manners,' or 'You\ncannot touch pitch without defilement,' or to spell out of Abedariums, or\nto read out of Jack Smith, or Sandford and Merton.  Only conceive him, I\nsay, drudging in such guise from morning till night, without any rational\nenjoyment but to beat the children.  Would you compare such a dog's life\nas that with your own--the happiest under heaven--true Eden life, as the\nGermans would say,--pitching your tent under the pleasant hedgerows,\nlistening to the song of the feathered tribes, collecting all the leaky\nkettles in the neighbourhood, soldering and joining, earning your honest\nbread by the wholesome sweat of your brow--making ten holes--hey, what's\nthis? what's the man crying for?\n\nSuddenly the tinker had covered his face with his hands, and begun to sob\nand moan like a man in the deepest distress; the breast of his wife was\nheaved with emotion; even the children were agitated, the youngest began\nto roar.\n\n_Myself_.  What's the matter with you; what are you all crying about?\n\n_Tinker_ (uncovering his face).  Lord, why to hear you talk; isn't that\nenough to make anybody cry--even the poor babes?  Yes, you said right,\n'tis life in the garden of Eden--the tinker's; I see so now that I'm\nabout to give it up.\n\n_Myself_.  Give it up! you must not think of such a thing.\n\n_Tinker_.  No, I can't bear to think of it, and yet I must; what's to be\ndone?  How hard to be frightened to death, to be driven off the roads.\n\n_Myself_.  Who has driven you off the roads?\n\n_Tinker_.  Who! the Flaming Tinman.\n\n_Myself_.  Who is he?\n\n_Tinker_.  The biggest rogue in England, and the cruellest, or he\nwouldn't have served me as he has done--I'll tell you all about it.  I\nwas born upon the roads, and so was my father before me, and my mother\ntoo; and I worked with them as long as they lived, as a dutiful child,\nfor I have nothing to reproach myself with on their account; and when my\nfather died I took up the business, and went his beat, and supported my\nmother for the little time she lived; and when she died I married this\nyoung woman, who was not born upon the roads, but was a small tradesman's\ndaughter, at Gloster.  She had a kindness for me, and, notwithstanding\nher friends were against the match, she married the poor tinker, and came\nto live with him upon the roads.  Well, young man, for six or seven years\nI--as the happiest fellow breathing, living just the life you described\njust now--respected by everybody in this beat; when in an evil hour comes\nthis Black Jack, this flaming tinman, into these parts, driven as they\nsay out of Yorkshire--for no good you may be sure.  Now there is no beat\nwill support two tinkers, as you doubtless know; mine was a good one, but\nit would not support the flying tinker and myself, though if it would\nhave supported twenty it would have been all the same to the flying\nvillain, who'll brook no one but himself; so he presently finds me out,\nand offers to fight me for the beat.  Now, being bred upon the roads, I\ncan fight a little, that is with anything like my match, but I was not\ngoing to fight him, who happens to be twice my size, and so I told him;\nwhereupon he knocks me down, and would have done me farther mischief had\nnot some men been nigh and prevented him; so he threatened to cut my\nthroat, and went his way.  Well, I did not like such usage at all, and\nwas woundily frightened, and tried to keep as much out of his way as\npossible, going anywhere but where I thought I was likely to meet him;\nand sure enough for several months I contrived to keep out of his way.  At\nlast somebody told me that he was gone back to Yorkshire, whereupon I was\nglad at heart, and ventured to show myself, going here and there as I did\nbefore.  Well, young man, it was yesterday that I and mine set ourselves\ndown in a lane, about five miles from here, and lighted our fire, and had\nour dinner, and after dinner I sat down to mend three kettles and a\nfrying pan which the people in the neighbourhood had given me to\nmend--for, as I told you before, I have a good connection, owing to my\nhonesty.  Well, as I sat there hard at work, happy as the day's long, and\nthinking of anything but what was to happen, who should come up but this\nBlack Jack, this king of the tinkers, rattling along in his cart, with\nhis wife, that they call Grey Moll, by his side--for the villain has got\na wife, and a maid-servant too; the last I never saw, but they that has,\nsays that she is as big as a house, and young, and well to look at, which\ncan't be all said of Moll, who, though she's big enough in all\nconscience, is neither young nor handsome.  Well, no sooner does he see\nme and mine, than, giving the reins to Grey Moll, he springs out of his\ncart, and comes straight at me; not a word did he say, but on he comes\nstraight at me like a wild bull.  I am a quiet man, young fellow, but I\nsaw now that quietness would be of no use, so I sprang up upon my legs,\nand being bred upon the roads, and able to fight a little, I squared as\nhe came running in upon me, and had a round or two with him.  Lord bless\nyou, young man, it was like a fly fighting with an elephant--one of those\nbig beasts the show-folks carry about.  I had not a chance with the\nfellow, he knocked me here, he knocked me there, knocked me into the\nhedge, and knocked me out again.  I was at my last shifts, and my poor\nwife saw it.  Now my poor wife, though she is as gentle as a pigeon, has\nyet a spirit of her own, and though she wasn't bred upon the roads, can\nscratch a little; so when she saw me at my last shifts, she flew at the\nvillain--she couldn't bear to see her partner murdered--and scratched the\nvillain's face.  Lord bless you, young man, she had better have been\nquiet: Grey Moll no sooner saw what she was about, than, springing out of\nthe cart, where she had sat all along perfectly quiet, save a little\nwhooping and screeching to encourage her blade:--Grey Moll, I say (my\nflesh creeps when I think of it--for I am a kind husband, and love my\npoor wife) . . .\n\n_Myself_.  Take another draught of the ale; you look frightened, and it\nwill do you good.  Stout liquor makes stout heart, as the man says in the\nplay.\n\n_Tinker_.  That's true, young man; here's to you--where was I?  Grey Moll\nno sooner saw what my wife was about, than, springing out of the cart,\nshe flew at my poor wife, clawed off her bonnet in a moment, and seized\nhold of her hair.  Lord bless you, young man, my poor wife, in the hands\nof Grey Moll, was nothing better than a pigeon in the claws of a buzzard\nhawk, or I in the hands of the Flaming Tinman, which when I saw, my heart\nwas fit to burst, and I determined to give up everything--everything to\nsave my poor wife out of Grey Moll's claws.  'Hold!' I shouted.  'Hold,\nboth of you--Jack, Moll.  Hold, both of you, for God's sake, and I'll do\nwhat you will: give up trade, and business, connection, bread, and\neverything, never more travel the roads, and go down on my knees to you\nin the bargain.'  Well, this had some effect; Moll let go my wife, and\nthe Blazing Tinman stopped for a moment; it was only for a moment,\nhowever, that he left off--all of a sudden he hit me a blow which sent me\nagainst a tree; and what did the villain then? why the flying villain\nseized me by the throat, and almost throttled me, roaring--what do you\nthink, young man, that the flaming villain roared out?\n\n_Myself_.  I really don't know--something horrible, I suppose.\n\n_Tinker_.  Horrible, indeed; you may well say horrible, young man;\nneither more nor less than the Bible--'A Bible, a Bible!' roared the\nBlazing Tinman; and he pressed my throat so hard against the tree that my\nsenses began to dwaul away--a Bible, a Bible, still ringing in my ears.\nNow, young man, my poor wife is a Christian woman, and, though she\ntravels the roads, carries a Bible with her at the bottom of her sack,\nwith which sometimes she teaches the children to read--it was the only\nthing she brought with her from the place of her kith and kin, save her\nown body and the clothes on her back; so my poor wife, half distracted,\nruns to her sack, pulls out the Bible, and puts it into the hand of the\nBlazing Tinman, who then thrusts the end of it into my mouth with such\nfury that it made my lips bleed, and broke short one of my teeth which\nhappened to be decayed.  'Swear,' said he, 'swear, you mumping villain,\ntake your Bible oath that you will quit and give up the beat altogether,\nor I'll--and then the hard-hearted villain made me swear by the Bible,\nand my own damnation, half-throttled as I was, to--to--I can't go on--\n\n_Myself_.  Take another draught--stout liquor--\n\n_Tinker_.  I can't, young man, my heart's too full, and what's more, the\npitcher is empty.\n\n_Myself_.  And so he swore you, I suppose, on the Bible, to quit the\nroads?\n\n_Tinker_.  You are right, he did so, the gypsy villain.\n\n_Myself_.  Gypsy!  Is he a gypsy?\n\n_Tinker_.  Not exactly; what they call a half-and-half.  His father was a\ngypsy, and his mother, like mine, one who walked the roads.\n\n_Myself_.  Is he of the Smiths--the Petulengres?\n\n_Tinker_.  I say, young man, you know a thing or two; one would think, to\nhear you talk, you had been bred upon the roads.  I thought none but\nthose bred upon the roads knew anything of that name--Petulengres!  No,\nnot he, he fights the Petulengres whenever he meets them; he likes nobody\nbut himself, and wants to be king of the roads.  I believe he is a Boss,\nor a--at any rate he's a bad one, as I know to my cost.\n\n_Myself_.  And what are you going to do?\n\n_Tinker_.  Do! you may well ask that; I don't know what to do.  My poor\nwife and I have been talking of that all the morning, over that half-pint\nmug of beer; we can't determine on what's to be done.  All we know is,\nthat we must quit the roads.  The villain swore that the next time he saw\nus on the roads he'd cut all our throats, and seize our horse and bit of\na cart that are now standing out there under the tree.\n\n_Myself_.  And what do you mean to do with your horse and cart?\n\n_Tinker_.  Another question!  What shall we do with our cart and pony?\nthey are of no use to us now.  Stay on the roads I will not, both for my\noath's sake and my own.  If we had a trifle of money, we were thinking of\ngoing to Bristol, where I might get up a little business, but we have\nnone; our last three farthings we spent about the mug of beer.\n\n_Myself_.  But why don't you sell your horse and cart?\n\n_Tinker_.  Sell them! and who would buy them, unless some one who wished\nto set up in my line; but there's no beat, and what's the use of the\nhorse and cart and the few tools without the beat?\n\n_Myself_.  I'm half inclined to buy your cart and pony, and your beat\ntoo.\n\n_Tinker_.  You!  How came you to think of such a thing?\n\n_Myself_.  Why, like yourself, I hardly know what to do.  I want a home\nand work.  As for a home, I suppose I can contrive to make a home out of\nyour tent and cart; and as for work, I must learn to be a tinker, it\nwould not be hard for one of my trade to learn to tinker; what better can\nI do?  Would you have me go to Chester and work there now?  I don't like\nthe thoughts of it.  If I go to Chester and work there, I can't be my own\nman; I must work under a master, and perhaps he and I should quarrel, and\nwhen I quarrel I am apt to hit folks, and those that hit folks are\nsometimes sent to prison; I don't like the thought either of going to\nChester or to Chester prison.  What do you think I could earn at Chester?\n\n_Tinker_.  A matter of eleven shillings a week, if anybody would employ\nyou, which I don't think they would with those hands of yours.  But\nwhether they would or not, if you are of a quarrelsome nature you must\nnot go to Chester; you would be in the castle in no time.  I don't know\nhow to advise you.  As for selling you my stock, I'd see you farther\nfirst, for your own sake.\n\n_Myself_.  Why?\n\n_Tinker_.  Why! you would get your head knocked off.  Suppose you were to\nmeet him?\n\n_Myself_.  Pooh, don't be afraid on my account; if I were to meet him I\ncould easily manage him one way or other.  I know all kinds of strange\nwords and names, and, as I told you before, I sometimes hit people when\nthey put me out.\n\nHere the tinker's wife, who for some minutes past had been listening\nattentively to our discourse, interposed, saying, in a low soft tone: 'I\nreally don't see, John, why you shouldn't sell the young man the things,\nseeing that he wishes for them, and is so confident; you have told him\nplainly how matters stand, and if anything ill should befall him, people\ncouldn't lay the blame on you; but I don't think any ill will befall him,\nand who knows but God has sent him to our assistance in time of need?'\n\n'I'll hear of no such thing,' said the tinker; 'I have drunk at the young\nman's expense, and though he says he's quarrelsome, I would not wish to\nsit in pleasanter company.  A pretty fellow I should be, now, if I were\nto let him follow his own will.  If he once sets up on my beat, he's a\nlost man, his ribs will be stove in, and his head knocked off his\nshoulders.  There, you are crying, but you shan't have your will though;\nI won't be the young man's destruction . . . If, indeed, I thought he\ncould manage the tinker--but he never can; he says he can hit, but it's\nno use hitting the tinker,--crying still! you are enough to drive one\nmad.  I say, young man, I believe you understand a thing or two, just now\nyou were talking of knowing hard words and names--I don't wish to send\nyou to your mischief--you say you know hard words and names; let us see.\nOnly on one condition I'll sell you the pony and things; as for the beat\nit's gone, isn't mine--sworn away by my own mouth.  Tell me what's my\nname; if you can't, may I--'\n\n_Myself_.  Don't swear, it's a bad habit, neither pleasant nor\nprofitable.  Your name is Slingsby--Jack Slingsby.  There, don't stare,\nthere's nothing in my telling you your name: I've been in these parts\nbefore, at least not very far from here.  Ten years ago, when I was\nlittle more than a child, I was about twenty miles from here in a post-\nchaise, at the door of an inn, and as I looked from the window of the\nchaise, I saw you standing by a gutter, with a big tin ladle in your\nhand, and somebody called you Jack Slingsby.  I never forget anything I\nhear or see; I can't, I wish I could.  So there's nothing strange in my\nknowing your name; indeed, there's nothing strange in anything, provided\nyou examine it to the bottom.  Now what am I to give you for the things?\n\nI paid Slingsby five pounds ten shillings for his stock in trade, cart,\nand pony--purchased sundry provisions of the landlady, also a wagoner's\nfrock, which had belonged to a certain son of hers, deceased, gave my\nlittle animal a feed of corn, and prepared to depart.\n\n'God bless you, young man,' said Slingsby, shaking me by the hand; 'you\nare the best friend I've had for many a day: I have but one thing to tell\nyou, Don't cross that fellow's path if you can help it; and stay--should\nthe pony refuse to go, just touch him so, and he'll fly like the wind.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX\n\n\nEffects of corn--One night longer--The hoofs--A stumble--Are you\nhurt?--What a difference--Drowsy--Maze of bushes--Housekeeping--Sticks\nand furze--The driftway--Account of stock--Anvil and bellows--Twenty\nyears.\n\nIt was two or three hours past noon when I took my departure from the\nplace of the last adventure, walking by the side of my little cart; the\npony, invigorated by the corn, to which he was probably not much\naccustomed, proceeded right gallantly; so far from having to hasten him\nforward by the particular application which the tinker had pointed out to\nme, I had rather to repress his eagerness, being, though an excellent\npedestrian, not unfrequently left behind.  The country through which I\npassed was beautiful and interesting, but solitary; few habitations\nappeared.  As it was quite a matter of indifference to me in what\ndirection I went, the whole world being before me, I allowed the pony to\ndecide upon the matter; it was not long before he left the high-road,\nbeing probably no friend to public places.  I followed him I knew not\nwhither, but, from subsequent observation, have reason to suppose that\nour course was in a north-west direction.  At length night came upon us,\nand a cold wind sprang up, which was succeeded by a drizzling rain.\n\nI had originally intended to pass the night in the cart, or to pitch my\nlittle tent on some convenient spot by the road's side; but, owing to the\nalteration in the weather, I thought that it would be advisable to take\nup my quarters in any hedge alehouse at which I might arrive.  To tell\nthe truth, I was not very sorry to have an excuse to pass the night once\nmore beneath a roof.  I had determined to live quite independent, but I\nhad never before passed a night by myself abroad, and felt a little\napprehensive at the idea; I hoped, however, on the morrow, to be a little\nmore prepared for the step, so I determined for one night--only for one\nnight longer--to sleep like a Christian; but human determinations are not\nalways put into effect, such a thing as opportunity is frequently\nwanting, such was the case here.  I went on for a considerable time, in\nexpectation of coming to some rustic hostelry, but nothing of the kind\npresented itself to my eyes; the country in which I now was seemed almost\nuninhabited, not a house of any kind was to be seen--at least I saw\nnone--though it is true houses might be near without my seeing them,\nowing to the darkness of the night, for neither moon nor star was abroad.\nI heard, occasionally, the bark of dogs; but the sound appeared to come\nfrom an immense distance.  The rain still fell, and the ground beneath my\nfeet was wet and miry; in short, it was a night in which even a tramper\nby profession would feel more comfortable in being housed than abroad.  I\nfollowed in the rear of the cart, the pony still proceeding at a sturdy\npace, till methought I heard other hoofs than those of my own nag; I\nlistened for a moment, and distinctly heard the sound of hoofs\napproaching at a great rate, and evidently from the quarter towards which\nI and my little caravan were moving.  We were in a dark lane--so dark\nthat it was impossible for me to see my own hand.  Apprehensive that some\naccident might occur, I ran forward, and, seizing the pony by the bridle,\ndrew him as near as I could to the hedge.  On came the hoofs--trot, trot,\ntrot; and evidently more than those of one horse; their speed as they\nadvanced appeared to slacken--it was only, however, for a moment.  I\nheard a voice cry, 'Push on,--this is a desperate robbing place,--never\nmind the dark'; and the hoofs came on quicker than before.  'Stop!' said\nI, at the top of my voice; 'stop! or--'  Before I could finish what I was\nabout to say there was a stumble, a heavy fall, a cry, and a groan, and\nputting out my foot I felt what I conjectured to be the head of a horse\nstretched upon the road.  'Lord have mercy upon us! what's the matter?'\nexclaimed a voice.  'Spare my life,' cried another voice, apparently from\nthe ground; 'only spare my life, and take all I have.'  'Where are you,\nMaster Wise?' cried the other voice.  'Help! here, Master Bat,' cried the\nvoice from the ground; 'help me up or I shall be murdered.'  'Why, what's\nthe matter?' said Bat.  'Some one has knocked me down, and is robbing\nme,' said the voice from the ground.  'Help! murder!' cried Bat; and,\nregardless of the entreaties of the man on the ground that he would stay\nand help him up, he urged his horse forward and galloped away as fast as\nhe could.  I remained for some time quiet, listening to various groans\nand exclamations uttered by the person on the ground; at length I said,\n'Holloa! are you hurt?'  'Spare my life, and take all I have!' said the\nvoice from the ground.  'Have they not done robbing you yet?' said I;\n'when they have finished let me know, and I will come and help you.'  'Who\nis that?' said the voice; 'pray come and help me, and do me no mischief.'\n'You were saying that some one was robbing you,' said I; 'don't think I\nshall come till he is gone away.'  'Then you ben't he?' said the voice.\n'Aren't you robbed?' said I.  'Can't say I be,' said the voice; 'not yet\nat any rate; but who are you?  I don't know you.'  'A traveller whom you\nand your partner were going to run over in this dark lane; you almost\nfrightened me out of my senses.'  'Frightened!' said the voice, in a\nlouder tone; 'frightened! oh!' and thereupon I heard somebody getting\nupon his legs.  This accomplished, the individual proceeded to attend to\nhis horse, and with a little difficulty raised him upon his legs also.\n'Aren't you hurt?' said I.  'Hurt!' said the voice; 'not I; don't think\nit, whatever the horse may be.  I tell you what, my fellow, I thought you\nwere a robber, and now I find you are not; I have a good mind--'  'To do\nwhat?'  'To serve you out; aren't you ashamed--?'  'At what?' said I;\n'not to have robbed you?  Shall I set about it now?'  'Ha, ha!' said the\nman, dropping the bullying tone which he had assumed; 'you are\njoking--robbing! who talks of robbing?  I wonder how my horse's knees\nare; not much hurt, I think--only mired.'  The man, whoever he was, then\ngot upon his horse; and, after moving him about a little, said, 'Good\nnight, friend; where are you?'  'Here I am,' said I, 'just behind you.'\n'You are, are you?  Take that.'  I know not what he did, but probably\npricking his horse with the spur the animal kicked out violently; one of\nhis heels struck me on the shoulder, but luckily missed my face; I fell\nback with the violence of the blow, whilst the fellow scampered off at a\ngreat rate.  Stopping at some distance, he loaded me with abuse, and\nthen, continuing his way at a rapid trot, I heard no more of him.\n\n'What a difference!' said I, getting up; 'last night I was feted in the\nhall of a rich genius, and to-night I am knocked down and mired in a dark\nlane by the heel of Master Wise's horse--I wonder who gave him that name?\nAnd yet he was wise enough to wreak his revenge upon me, and I was not\nwise enough to keep out of his way.  Well, I am not much hurt, so it is\nof little consequence.'\n\nI now bethought me that, as I had a carriage of my own, I might as well\nmake use of it; I therefore got into the cart, and, taking the reins in\nmy hand, gave an encouraging cry to the pony, whereupon the sturdy little\nanimal started again at as brisk a pace as if he had not already come\nmany a long mile.  I lay half reclining in the cart, holding the reins\nlazily, and allowing the animal to go just where he pleased, often\nwondering where he would conduct me.  At length I felt drowsy, and my\nhead sank upon my breast; I soon aroused myself, but it was only to doze\nagain; this occurred several times.  Opening my eyes after a doze\nsomewhat longer than the others, I found that the drizzling rain had\nceased, a corner of the moon was apparent in the heavens, casting a faint\nlight; I looked around for a moment or two, but my eyes and brain were\nheavy with slumber, and I could scarcely distinguish where we were.  I\nhad a kind of dim consciousness that we were traversing an uninclosed\ncountry--perhaps a heath; I thought, however, that I saw certain large\nblack objects looming in the distance, which I had a confused idea might\nbe woods or plantations; the pony still moved at his usual pace.  I did\nnot find the jolting of the cart at all disagreeable, on the contrary, it\nhad quite a somniferous effect upon me.  Again my eyes closed; I opened\nthem once more, but with less perception in them than before, looked\nforward, and, muttering something about woodlands, I placed myself in an\neasier posture than I had hitherto done, and fairly fell asleep.\n\nHow long I continued in that state I am unable to say, but I believe for\na considerable time; I was suddenly awakened by the ceasing of the\njolting to which I had become accustomed, and of which I was perfectly\nsensible in my sleep.  I started up and looked around me, the moon was\nstill shining, and the face of the heaven was studded with stars; I found\nmyself amidst a maze of bushes of various kinds, but principally hazel\nand holly, through which was a path or driftway with grass growing on\neither side, upon which the pony was already diligently browsing.  I\nconjectured that this place had been one of the haunts of his former\nmaster, and, on dismounting and looking about, was strengthened in that\nopinion by finding a spot under an ash tree which, from its burnt and\nblackened appearance, seemed to have been frequently used as a fireplace.\nI will take up my quarters here, thought I; it is an excellent spot for\nme to commence my new profession in; I was quite right to trust myself to\nthe guidance of the pony.  Unharnessing the animal without delay, I\npermitted him to browse at free will on the grass, convinced that he\nwould not wander far from a place to which he was so much attached; I\nthen pitched the little tent close beside the ash tree to which I have\nalluded, and conveyed two or three articles into it, and instantly felt\nthat I had commenced housekeeping for the first time in my life.\nHousekeeping, however, without a fire is a very sorry affair, something\nlike the housekeeping of children in their toy houses; of this I was the\nmore sensible from feeling very cold and shivering, owing to my late\nexposure to the rain, and sleeping in the night air.  Collecting,\ntherefore, all the dry sticks and furze I could find, I placed them upon\nthe fireplace, adding certain chips and a billet which I found in the\ncart, it having apparently been the habit of Slingsby to carry with him a\nsmall store of fuel.  Having then struck a spark in a tinder-box and\nlighted a match, I set fire to the combustible heap, and was not slow in\nraising a cheerful blaze; I then drew my cart near the fire, and, seating\nmyself on one of the shafts, hung over the warmth with feelings of\nintense pleasure and satisfaction.  Having continued in this posture for\na considerable time, I turned my eyes to the heaven in the direction of a\nparticular star; I, however, could not find the star, nor indeed many of\nthe starry train, the greater number having fled, from which\ncircumstance, and from the appearance of the sky, I concluded that\nmorning was nigh.  About this time I again began to feel drowsy; I\ntherefore arose, and having prepared for myself a kind of couch in the\ntent, I flung myself upon it and went to sleep.\n\nI will not say that I was awakened in the morning by the carolling of\nbirds, as I perhaps might if I were writing a novel; I awoke because, to\nuse vulgar language, I had slept my sleep out, not because the birds were\ncarolling around me in numbers, as they had probably been for hours\nwithout my hearing them.  I got up and left my tent; the morning was yet\nmore bright than that of the preceding day.  Impelled by curiosity, I\nwalked about endeavouring to ascertain to what place chance, or rather\nthe pony, had brought me; following the driftway for some time, amidst\nbushes and stunted trees, I came to a grove of dark pines, through which\nit appeared to lead; I tracked it a few hundred yards, but seeing nothing\nbut trees, and the way being wet and sloughy, owing to the recent rain, I\nreturned on my steps, and, pursuing the path in another direction, came\nto a sandy road leading over a common, doubtless the one I had traversed\nthe preceding night.  My curiosity satisfied, I returned to my little\nencampment, and on the way beheld a small footpath on the left winding\nthrough the bushes, which had before escaped my observation.  Having\nreached my tent and cart, I breakfasted on some of the provisions which I\nhad procured the day before, and then proceeded to take a regular account\nof the stock formerly possessed by Slingsby the tinker, but now become my\nown by right of lawful purchase.\n\nBesides the pony, the cart, and the tent, I found I was possessed of a\nmattress stuffed with straw on which to lie, and a blanket to cover me,\nthe last quite clean and nearly new; then there was a frying-pan and a\nkettle, the first for cooking any food which required cooking, and the\nsecond for heating any water which I might wish to heat.  I likewise\nfound an earthen teapot and two or three cups; of the first I should\nrather say I found the remains, it being broken in three parts, no doubt\nsince it came into my possession, which would have precluded the\npossibility of my asking anybody to tea for the present, should anybody\nvisit me, even supposing I had tea and sugar, which was not the case.  I\nthen overhauled what might more strictly be called the stock in trade;\nthis consisted of various tools, an iron ladle, a chafing-pan and small\nbellows, sundry pans and kettles, the latter being of tin, with the\nexception of one which was of copper, all in a state of considerable\ndilapidation--if I may use the term; of these first Slingsby had spoken\nin particular, advising me to mend them as soon as possible, and to\nendeavour to sell them, in order that I might have the satisfaction of\nreceiving some return upon the outlay which I had made.  There was\nlikewise a small quantity of block tin, sheet tin, and solder.  'This\nSlingsby,' said I, 'is certainly a very honest man, he has sold me more\nthan my money's worth; I believe, however, there is something more in the\ncart.'  Thereupon I rummaged the farther end of the cart, and, amidst a\nquantity of straw, I found a small anvil and bellows of that kind which\nare used in forges, and two hammers such as smiths use, one great, and\nthe other small.\n\nThe sight of these last articles caused me no little surprise, as no word\nwhich had escaped from the mouth of Slingsby had given me reason to\nsuppose that he had ever followed the occupation of a smith; yet, if he\nhad not, how did he come by them?  I sat down upon the shaft, and\npondered the question deliberately in my mind; at length I concluded that\nhe had come by them by one of those numerous casualties which occur upon\nthe roads, of which I, being a young hand upon the roads, must have a\nvery imperfect conception; honestly, of course--for I scouted the idea\nthat Slingsby would have stolen this blacksmith's gear--for I had the\nhighest opinion of his honesty, which opinion I still retain at the\npresent day, which is upwards of twenty years from the time of which I am\nspeaking, during the whole of which period I have neither seen the poor\nfellow nor received any intelligence of him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX\n\n\nNew profession--Beautiful night--Jupiter--Sharp and shrill--The Rommany\nchi--All alone--Three-and-sixpence--What is Rommany?  Be civil--Parraco\ntute--Slight start--She will be grateful--The rustling.\n\nI passed the greater part of the day in endeavouring to teach myself the\nmysteries of my new profession.  I cannot say that I was very successful,\nbut the time passed agreeably, and was therefore not ill spent.  Towards\nevening I flung my work aside, took some refreshment, and afterwards a\nwalk.\n\nThis time I turned up the small footpath of which I have already spoken.\nIt led in a zigzag manner through thickets of hazel, elder, and sweet-\nbrier; after following its windings for somewhat better than a furlong, I\nheard a gentle sound of water, and presently came to a small rill, which\nran directly across the path.  I was rejoiced at the sight, for I had\nalready experienced the want of water, which I yet knew must be nigh at\nhand, as I was in a place to all appearance occasionally frequented by\nwandering people, who I was aware never take up their quarters in places\nwhere water is difficult to be obtained.  Forthwith I stretched myself on\nthe ground, and took a long and delicious draught of the crystal stream,\nand then, seating myself in a bush, I continued for some time gazing on\nthe water as it purled tinkling away in its channel through an opening in\nthe hazels, and should have probably continued much longer had not the\nthought that I had left my property unprotected compelled me to rise and\nreturn to my encampment.\n\nNight came on, and a beautiful night it was; up rose the moon, and\ninnumerable stars decked the firmament of heaven.  I sat on the shaft, my\neyes turned upwards.  I had found it: there it was twinkling millions of\nmiles above me, mightiest star of the system to which we belong: of all\nstars the one which has most interest for me--the star Jupiter.\n\nWhy have I always taken an interest in thee, O Jupiter?  I know nothing\nabout thee, save what every child knows, that thou art a big star, whose\nonly light is derived from moons.  And is not that knowledge enough to\nmake me feel an interest in thee?  Ay, truly; I never look at thee\nwithout wondering what is going on in thee; what is life in Jupiter?  That\nthere is life in Jupiter who can doubt?  There is life in our own little\nstar, therefore there must be life in Jupiter, which is not a little\nstar.  But how different must life be in Jupiter from what it is in our\nown little star!  Life here is life beneath the dear sun--life in Jupiter\nis life beneath moons--four moons--no single moon is able to illumine\nthat vast bulk.  All know what life is in our own little star; it is\nanything but a routine of happiness here, where the dear sun rises to us\nevery day: then how sad and moping must life be in mighty Jupiter, on\nwhich no sun ever shines, and which is never lighted save by pale\nmoonbeams!  The thought that there is more sadness and melancholy in\nJupiter than in this world of ours, where, alas! there is but too much,\nhas always made me take a melancholy interest in that huge distant star.\n\nTwo or three days passed by in much the same manner as the first.  During\nthe morning I worked upon my kettles, and employed the remaining part of\nthe day as I best could.  The whole of this time I only saw two\nindividuals, rustics, who passed by my encampment without vouchsafing me\na glance; they probably considered themselves my superiors, as perhaps\nthey were.\n\nOne very brilliant morning, as I sat at work in very good spirits, for by\nthis time I had actually mended in a very creditable way, as I imagined,\ntwo kettles and a frying-pan, I heard a voice which seemed to proceed\nfrom the path leading to the rivulet; at first it sounded from a\nconsiderable distance, but drew nearer by degrees.  I soon remarked that\nthe tones were exceedingly sharp and shrill, with yet something of\nchildhood in them.  Once or twice I distinguished certain words in the\nsong which the voice was singing; the words were--but no, I thought again\nI was probably mistaken--and then the voice ceased for a time; presently\nI heard it again, close to the entrance of the footpath; in another\nmoment I heard it in the lane or glade in which stood my tent, where it\nabruptly stopped, but not before I had heard the very words which I at\nfirst thought I had distinguished.\n\nI turned my head; at the entrance of the footpath, which might be about\nthirty yards from the place where I was sitting, I perceived the figure\nof a young girl; her face was turned towards me, and she appeared to be\nscanning me and my encampment; after a little time she looked in the\nother direction, only for a moment, however; probably observing nothing\nin that quarter, she again looked towards me, and almost immediately\nstepped forward; and, as she advanced, sang the song which I had heard in\nthe wood, the first words of which were those which I have already\nalluded to.\n\n   'The Rommany chi\n   And the Rommany chal\n   Shall jaw tasaulor\n   To drab the bawlor,\n   And dook the gry\n   Of the farming rye.'\n\n{picture:'The Rommany chi.': page393.jpg}\n\nA very pretty song, thought I, falling again hard to work upon my kettle;\na very pretty song, which bodes the farmers much good.  Let them look to\ntheir cattle.\n\n'All alone here, brother?' said a voice close by me, in sharp but not\ndisagreeable tones.\n\nI made no answer, but continued my work, click, click, with the gravity\nwhich became one of my profession.  I allowed at least half a minute to\nelapse before I even lifted up my eyes.\n\nA girl of about thirteen was standing before me; her features were very\npretty, but with a peculiar expression; her complexion was a clear olive,\nand her jet black hair hung back upon her shoulders.  She was rather\nscantily dressed, and her arms and feet were bare; round her neck,\nhowever, was a handsome string of corals, with ornaments of gold; in her\nhand she held a bulrush.\n\n'All alone here, brother?' said the girl, as I looked up; 'all alone\nhere, in the lane; where are your wife and children?'\n\n'Why do you call me brother?' said I; 'am no brother of yours.  Do you\ntake me for one of your people?  I am no gypsy; not I, indeed!'\n\n'Don't be afraid, brother, you are no Roman--Roman indeed, you are not\nhandsome enough to be a Roman; not black enough, tinker though you be.  If\nI called you brother, it was because I didn't know what else to call you.\nMarry, come up, brother, I should be sorry to have you for a brother.'\n\n'Then you don't like me?'\n\n'Neither like you nor dislike you, brother; what will you have for that\nkekaubi?'\n\n'What's the use of talking to me in that unchristian way; what do you\nmean, young gentlewoman?'\n\n'Lord, brother, what a fool you are; every tinker knows what a kekaubi\nis.  I was asking you what you would have for that kettle.'\n\n'Three-and-sixpence, young gentlewoman; isn't it well mended?'\n\n'Well mended!  I could have done it better myself; three-and-sixpence!\nit's only fit to be played at football with.'\n\n'I will take no less for it, young gentlewoman; it has caused me a world\nof trouble.'\n\n'I never saw a worse mended kettle.  I say, brother, your hair is white.'\n\n''Tis nature; your hair is black; nature, nothing but nature.'\n\n'I am young, brother; my hair is black--that's nature: you are young,\nbrother; your hair is white--that's not nature.'\n\n'I can't help it if it be not, but it is nature after all; did you never\nsee gray hair on the young?'\n\n'Never!  I have heard it is true of a gray lad, and a bad one he was.  Oh,\nso bad.'\n\n'Sit down on the grass, and tell me all about it, sister; do, to oblige\nme, pretty sister.'\n\n'Hey, brother, you don't speak as you did--you don't speak like a gorgio,\nyou speak like one of us, you call me sister.'\n\n'As you call me brother; I am not an uncivil person after all, sister.'\n\n'I say, brother, tell me one thing, and look me in the face--there--do\nyou speak Rommany?'\n\n'Rommany!  Rommany! what is Rommany?'\n\n'What is Rommany? our language to be sure; tell me, brother, only one\nthing, you don't speak Rommany?'\n\n'You say it.'\n\n'I don't say it, I wish to know.  Do you speak Rommany?'\n\n'Do you mean thieves' slang--cant? no, I don't speak cant, don't like it,\nI only know a few words; they call a sixpence a tanner, don't they?'\n\n'I don't know,' said the girl, sitting down on the ground, 'I was almost\nthinking--well, never mind, you don't know Rommany.  I say, brother, I\nthink I should like to have the kekaubi.'\n\n'I thought you said it was badly mended?'\n\n'Yes, yes, brother, but--'\n\n'I thought you said it was only fit to be played at football with?'\n\n'Yes, yes, brother, but--'\n\n'What will you give for it?'\n\n'Brother, I am the poor person's child, I will give you sixpence for the\nkekaubi.'\n\n'Poor person's child; how came you by that necklace?'\n\n'Be civil, brother; am I to have the kekaubi?'\n\n'Not for sixpence; isn't the kettle nicely mended?'\n\n'I never saw a nicer mended kettle, brother; am I to have the kekaubi,\nbrother?'\n\n'You like me then?'\n\n'I don't dislike you--I dislike no one; there's only one, and him I don't\ndislike, him I hate.'\n\n'Who is he?'\n\n'I scarcely know, I never saw him, but 'tis no affair of yours, you don't\nspeak Rommany; you will let me have the kekaubi, pretty brother?'\n\n'You may have it, but not for sixpence; I'll give it to you.'\n\n'Parraco tute, that is, I thank you, brother; the rikkeni kekaubi is now\nmine.  O, rare!  I thank you kindly, brother.'\n\nStarting up, she flung the bulrush aside which she had hitherto held in\nher hand, and, seizing the kettle, she looked at it for a moment, and\nthen began a kind of dance, flourishing the kettle over her head the\nwhile, and singing--\n\n   'The Rommany chi\n   And the Rommany chal\n   Shall jaw tasaulor\n   To drab the bawlor,\n   And dook the gry\n   Of the farming rye.\n\nGood-bye, brother, I must be going.'\n\n'Good-bye, sister; why do you sing that wicked song?'\n\n'Wicked song, hey, brother! you don't understand the song!'\n\n'Ha, ha! gypsy daughter,' said I, starting up and clapping my hands, 'I\ndon't understand Rommany, don't I?  You shall see; here's the answer to\nyour gillie--\n\n   'The Rommany chi\n   And the Rommany chal,\n   Love Luripen\n   And dukkeripen,\n   And hokkeripen,\n   And every pen\n   But Lachipen\n   And tatchipen.'\n\nThe girl, who had given a slight start when I began, remained for some\ntime after I had concluded the song standing motionless as a statue, with\nthe kettle in her hand.  At length she came towards me, and stared me\nfull in the face.  'Gray, tall, and talks Rommany,' said she to herself.\nIn her countenance there was an expression which I had not seen before--an\nexpression which struck me as being composed of fear, curiosity, and the\ndeepest hate.  It was momentary, however, and was succeeded by one\nsmiling, frank, and open.  'Ha, ha, brother,' said she, 'well, I like you\nall the better for talking Rommany; it is a sweet language, isn't it?\nespecially as you sing it.  How did you pick it up?  But you picked it up\nupon the roads, no doubt?  Ha, it was funny in you to pretend not to know\nit, and you so flush with it all the time; it was not kind in you,\nhowever, to frighten the poor person's child so by screaming out, but it\nwas kind in you to give the rikkeni kekaubi to the child of the poor\nperson.  She will be grateful to you; she will bring you her little dog\nto show you, her pretty juggal; the poor person's child will come and see\nyou again; you are not going away to-day, I hope, or to-morrow, pretty\nbrother, gray-haired brother--you are not going away to-morrow, I hope?'\n\n'Nor the next day,' said I, 'only to take a stroll to see if I can sell a\nkettle; good-bye, little sister, Rommany sister, dingy sister.'\n\n'Good-bye, tall brother,' said the girl, as she departed, singing\n\n   'The Rommany chi,' etc.\n\n'There's something about that girl that I don't understand,' said I to\nmyself; 'something mysterious.  However, it is nothing to me, she knows\nnot who I am, and if she did, what then?'\n\nLate that evening as I sat on the shaft of my cart in deep meditation,\nwith my arms folded, I thought I heard a rustling in the bushes over\nagainst me.  I turned my eyes in that direction, but saw nothing.  'Some\nbird,' said I; 'an owl, perhaps'; and once more I fell into meditation;\nmy mind wandered from one thing to another--musing now on the structure\nof the Roman tongue--now on the rise and fall of the Persian power--and\nnow on the powers vested in recorders at quarter-sessions.  I was\nthinking what a fine thing it must be to be a recorder of the peace,\nwhen, lifting up my eyes, I saw right opposite, not a culprit at the bar,\nbut, staring at me through a gap in the bush, a face wild and strange,\nhalf covered with gray hair; I only saw it a moment, the next it had\ndisappeared.\n\n{picture:I saw, staring at me through a gap in the bush, a face wild and\nstrange, half covered with gray hair: page396.jpg}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI\n\n\nFriend of Slingsby--All quiet--Danger--The two cakes--Children in the\nwood--Don't be angry--In deep thought--Temples throbbing--Deadly\nsick--Another blow--No answer--How old are you?--Play and sacrament--Heavy\nheart--Song of poison--Drow of gypsies--The dog--Ely's church--Get up,\nbebee--The vehicle--Can you speak?--The oil.\n\nThe next day, at an early hour, I harnessed my little pony, and, putting\nmy things in my cart, I went on my projected stroll.  Crossing the moor,\nI arrived in about an hour at a small village, from which, after a short\nstay, I proceeded to another, and from thence to a third.  I found that\nthe name of Slingsby was well known in these parts.\n\n'If you are a friend of Slingsby you must be an honest lad,' said an\nancient crone; 'you shall never want for work whilst I can give it you.\nHere, take my kettle, the bottom came out this morning, and lend me that\nof yours till you bring it back.  I'm not afraid to trust you--not I.\nDon't hurry yourself, young man, if you don't come back for a fortnight I\nshan't have the worse opinion of you.'\n\nI returned to my quarters at evening, tired, but rejoiced at heart; I had\nwork before me for several days, having collected various kekaubies which\nrequired mending, in place of those which I left behind--those which I\nhad been employed upon during the last few days.  I found all quiet in\nthe lane or glade, and, unharnessing my little horse, I once more pitched\nmy tent in the old spot beneath the ash, lighted my fire, ate my frugal\nmeal, and then, after looking for some time at the heavenly bodies, and\nmore particularly at the star Jupiter, I entered my tent, lay down upon\nmy pallet, and went to sleep.\n\nNothing occurred on the following day which requires any particular\nnotice, nor indeed on the one succeeding that.  It was about noon on the\nthird day that I sat beneath the shade of the ash tree; I was not at\nwork, for the weather was particularly hot, and I felt but little\ninclination to make any exertion.  Leaning my back against the tree, I\nwas not long in falling into a slumber; I particularly remember that\nslumber of mine beneath the ash tree, for it was about the sweetest\nslumber that I ever enjoyed; how long I continued in it I do not know; I\ncould almost have wished that it had lasted to the present time.  All of\na sudden it appeared to me that a voice cried in my ear, 'Danger! danger!\ndanger!'  Nothing seemingly could be more distinct than the words which I\nheard; then an uneasy sensation came over me, which I strove to get rid\nof, and at last succeeded, for I awoke.  The gypsy girl was standing just\nopposite to me, with her eyes fixed upon my countenance; a singular kind\nof little dog stood beside her.\n\n'Ha!' said I, 'was it you that cried danger?  What danger is there?'\n\n'Danger, brother, there is no danger; what danger should there be?  I\ncalled to my little dog, but that was in the wood; my little dog's name\nis not danger, but Stranger; what danger should there be, brother?'\n\n'What, indeed, except in sleeping beneath a tree; what is that you have\ngot in your hand?'\n\n'Something for you,' said the girl, sitting down and proceeding to untie\na white napkin; 'a pretty manricli, so sweet, so nice; when I went home\nto my people I told my grandbebee how kind you had been to the poor\nperson's child, and when my grandbebee saw the kekaubi, she said, \"Hir mi\ndevlis, it won't do for the poor people to be ungrateful; by my God, I\nwill bake a cake for the young harko mescro.\"'\n\n'But there are two cakes.'\n\n'Yes, brother, two cakes, both for you; my grandbebee meant them both for\nyou--but list, brother, I will have one of them for bringing them.  I\nknow you will give me one, pretty brother, gray-haired brother--which\nshall I have, brother?'\n\nIn the napkin were two round cakes, seemingly made of rich and costly\ncompounds, and precisely similar in form, each weighing about half a\npound.\n\n'Which shall I have, brother?' said the gypsy girl.\n\n'Whichever you please.'\n\n'No, brother, no, the cakes are yours, not mine.  It is for you to say.'\n\n'Well, then, give me the one nearest you, and take the other.'\n\n'Yes, brother, yes,' said the girl; and taking the cakes, she flung them\ninto the air two or three times, catching them as they fell, and singing\nthe while.  'Pretty brother, gray-haired brother--here, brother,' said\nshe, 'here is your cake, this other is mine.'\n\n'Are you sure,' said I, taking the cake, 'that this is the one I chose?'\n\n'Quite sure, brother; but if you like you can have mine; there's no\ndifference, however--shall I eat?'\n\n'Yes, sister, eat.'\n\n'See, brother, I do; now, brother, eat, pretty brother, gray-haired\nbrother.'\n\n'I am not hungry.'\n\n'Not hungry! well, what then--what has being hungry to do with the\nmatter?  It is my grandbebee's cake which was sent because you were kind\nto the poor person's child; eat, brother, eat, and we shall be like the\nchildren in the wood that the gorgios speak of.'\n\n'The children in the wood had nothing to eat.'\n\n'Yes, they had hips and haws; we have better.  Eat, brother.'\n\n'See, sister, I do,' and I ate a piece of the cake.\n\n'Well, brother, how do you like it?' said the girl, looking fixedly at\nme.\n\n'It is very rich and sweet, and yet there is something strange about it;\nI don't think I shall eat any more.'\n\n'Fie, brother, fie, to find fault with the poor person's cake; see, I\nhave nearly eaten mine.'\n\n'That's a pretty little dog.'\n\n'Is it not, brother? that's my juggal, my little sister, as I call her.'\n\n'Come here, juggal,' said I to the animal.\n\n'What do you want with my juggal?' said the girl.\n\n'Only to give her a piece of cake,' said I, offering the dog a piece\nwhich I had just broken off.\n\n'What do you mean?' said the girl, snatching the dog away; 'my\ngrandbebee's cake is not for dogs.'\n\n'Why, I just now saw you give the animal a piece of yours.'\n\n'You lie, brother, you saw no such thing; but I see how it is, you wish\nto affront the poor person's child.  I shall go to my house.'\n\n'Keep still, and don't be angry; see, I have eaten the piece which I\noffered the dog.  I meant no offence.  It is a sweet cake after all.'\n\n'Isn't it, brother?  I am glad you like it.  Offence, brother, no offence\nat all!  I am so glad you like my grandbebee's cake, but she will be\nwanting me at home.  Eat one piece more of grandbebee's cake, and I will\ngo.'\n\n'I am not hungry, I will put the rest by.'\n\n'One piece more before I go, handsome brother, gray-haired brother.'\n\n'I will not eat any more, I have already eaten more than I wished to\noblige you; if you must go, good-day to you.'\n\nThe girl rose upon her feet, looked hard at me, then at the remainder of\nthe cake which I held in my hand, and then at me again, and then stood\nfor a moment or two, as if in deep thought; presently an air of\nsatisfaction came over her countenance, she smiled and said, 'Well,\nbrother, well, do as you please, I merely wished you to eat because you\nhave been so kind to the poor person's child.  She loves you so, that she\ncould have wished to have seen you eat it all; good-bye, brother, I\ndaresay when I am gone you will eat some more of it, and if you don't, I\ndaresay you have eaten enough to--to--show your love for us.  After all\nit was a poor person's cake, a Rommany manricli, and all you gorgios are\nsomewhat gorgious.  Farewell, brother, pretty brother, gray-haired\nbrother.  Come, juggal.'\n\nI remained under the ash tree seated on the grass for a minute or two,\nand endeavoured to resume the occupation in which I had been engaged\nbefore I fell asleep, but I felt no inclination for labour.  I then\nthought I would sleep again, and once more reclined against the tree, and\nslumbered for some little time, but my sleep was more agitated than\nbefore.  Something appeared to bear heavy on my breast, I struggled in my\nsleep, fell on the grass, and awoke; my temples were throbbing, there was\na burning in my eyes, and my mouth felt parched; the oppression about the\nchest which I had felt in my sleep still continued.  'I must shake off\nthese feelings,' said I, 'and get upon my legs.'  I walked rapidly up and\ndown upon the green sward; at length, feeling my thirst increase, I\ndirected my steps down the narrow path to the spring which ran amidst the\nbushes; arriving there, I knelt down and drank of the water, but on\nlifting up my head I felt thirstier than before; again I drank, but with\nthe like result; I was about to drink for the third time, when I felt a\ndreadful qualm which instantly robbed me of nearly all my strength.  What\ncan be the matter with me? thought I; but I suppose I have made myself\nill by drinking cold water.  I got up and made the best of my way back to\nmy tent; before I reached it the qualm had seized me again, and I was\ndeadly sick.  I flung myself on my pallet, qualm succeeded qualm, but in\nthe intervals my mouth was dry and burning, and I felt a frantic desire\nto drink, but no water was at hand, and to reach the spring once more was\nimpossible; the qualms continued, deadly pains shot through my whole\nframe; I could bear my agonies no longer, and I fell into a trance or\nswoon.  How long I continued therein I know not; on recovering, however,\nI felt somewhat better, and attempted to lift my head off my couch; the\nnext moment, however, the qualms and pains returned, if possible, with\ngreater violence than before.  I am dying, thought I, like a dog, without\nany help; and then methought I heard a sound at a distance like people\nsinging, and then once more I relapsed into my swoon.\n\nI revived just as a heavy blow sounded upon the canvas of the tent.  I\nstarted, but my condition did not permit me to rise; again the same kind\nof blow sounded upon the canvas; I thought for a moment of crying out and\nrequesting assistance, but an inexplicable something chained my tongue,\nand now I heard a whisper on the outside of the tent.  'He does not move,\nbebee,' said a voice which I knew.  'I should not wonder if it has done\nfor him already; however, strike again with your ran'; and then there was\nanother blow, after which another voice cried aloud in a strange tone,\n'Is the gentleman of the house asleep, or is he taking his dinner?'  I\nremained quite silent and motionless, and in another moment the voice\ncontinued, 'What, no answer? what can the gentleman of the house be about\nthat he makes no answer? perhaps the gentleman of the house may be\ndarning his stockings?'  Thereupon a face peered into the door of the\ntent, at the farther extremity of which I was stretched.  It was that of\na woman, but owing to the posture in which she stood, with her back to\nthe light, and partly owing to a large straw bonnet, I could distinguish\nbut very little of the features of her countenance.  I had, however,\nrecognised her voice; it was that of my old acquaintance, Mrs. Herne.\n'Ho, ho, sir!' said she, 'here you are.  Come here, Leonora,' said she to\nthe gypsy girl, who pressed in at the other side of the door; 'here is\nthe gentleman, not asleep, but only stretched out after dinner.  Sit down\non your ham, child, at the door, I shall do the same.  There--you have\nseen me before, sir, have you not?'\n\n'The gentleman makes no answer, bebee; perhaps he does not know you.'\n\n'I have known him of old, Leonora,' said Mrs. Herne; 'and, to tell you\nthe truth, though I spoke to him just now, I expected no answer.'\n\n'It's a way he has, bebee, I suppose?'\n\n'Yes, child, it's a way he has.'\n\n'Take off your bonnet, bebee, perhaps he cannot see your face.'\n\n'I do not think that will be of much use, child; however, I will take off\nmy bonnet--there--and shake out my hair--there--you have seen this hair\nbefore, sir, and this face--'\n\n'No answer, bebee.'\n\n'Though the one was not quite so gray, nor the other so wrinkled.'\n\n'How came they so, bebee?'\n\n'All along of this gorgio, child.'\n\n'The gentleman in the house, you mean, bebee?'\n\n'Yes, child, the gentleman in the house.  God grant that I may preserve\nmy temper.  Do you know, sir, my name?  My name is Herne, which signifies\na hairy individual, though neither gray-haired nor wrinkled.  It is not\nthe nature of the Hernes to be gray or wrinkled, even when they are old,\nand I am not old.'\n\n'How old are you, bebee?'\n\n'Sixty-five years, child--an inconsiderable number.  My mother was a\nhundred and one--a considerable age--when she died, yet she had not one\ngray hair, and not more than six wrinkles--an inconsiderable number.'\n\n'She had no griefs, bebee?'\n\n'Plenty, child, but not like mine.'\n\n'Not quite so hard to bear, bebee?'\n\n'No, child; my head wanders when I think of them.  After the death of my\nhusband, who came to his end untimeously, I went to live with a daughter\nof mine, married out among certain Romans who walk about the eastern\ncounties, and with whom for some time I found a home and pleasant\nsociety, for they lived right Romanly, which gave my heart considerable\nsatisfaction, who am a Roman born, and hope to die so.  When I say right\nRomanly, I mean that they kept to themselves, and were not much given to\nblabbing about their private matters in promiscuous company.  Well,\nthings went on in this way for some time, when one day my son-in-law\nbrings home a young gorgio of singular and outrageous ugliness, and,\nwithout much preamble, says to me and mine, \"This is my pal, ain't he a\nbeauty? fall down and worship him.\"  \"Hold,\" said I, \"I for one will\nnever consent to such foolishness.\"'\n\n'That was right, bebee, I think I should have done the same.'\n\n'I think you would, child; but what was the profit of it?  The whole\nparty makes an almighty of this gorgio, lets him into their ways, says\nprayers of his making, till things come to such a pass that my own\ndaughter says to me, \"I shall buy myself a veil and fan, and treat myself\nto a play and sacrament.\"  \"Don't,\" says I; says she, \"I should like for\nonce in my life to be courtesied to as a Christian gentlewoman.\"'\n\n'Very foolish of her, bebee.'\n\n'Wasn't it, child?  Where was I?  At the fan and sacrament; with a heavy\nheart I put seven score miles between us, came back to the hairy ones,\nand found them over-given to gorgious companions; said I, \"Foolish\nmanners is catching; all this comes of that there gorgio.\"  Answers the\nchild Leonora, \"Take comfort, bebee; I hate the gorgios as much as you\ndo.\"'\n\n'And I say so again, bebee, as much or more.'\n\n'Time flows on, I engage in many matters, in most miscarry.  Am sent to\nprison; says I to myself, I am become foolish.  Am turned out of prison,\nand go back to the hairy ones, who receive me not over courteously; says\nI, for their unkindness, and my own foolishness, all the thanks to that\ngorgio.  Answers to me the child, \"I wish I could set eyes upon him,\nbebee.\"'\n\n'I did so, bebee; go on.'\n\n'\"How shall I know him, bebee?\" says the child.  \"Young and gray, tall,\nand speaks Romanly.\"  Runs to me the child, and says, \"I've found him,\nbebee.\"  \"Where, child?\" says I.  \"Come with me, bebee,\" says the child.\n\"That's he,\" says I, as I looked at my gentleman through the hedge.'\n\n'Ha, ha! bebee, and here he lies, poisoned like a hog.'\n\n'You have taken drows, sir,' said Mrs. Herne; 'do you hear, sir? drows;\ntip him a stave, child, of the song of poison.'\n\nAnd thereupon the girl clapped her hands, and sang--\n\n   'The Rommany churl\n   And the Rommany girl\n   To-morrow shall hie\n   To poison the sty,\n   And bewitch on the mead\n   The farmer's steed.'\n\n'Do you hear that, sir?' said Mrs. Herne; 'the child has tipped you a\nstave of the song of poison: that is, she has sung it Christianly, though\nperhaps you would like to hear it Romanly; you were always fond of what\nwas Roman.  Tip it him Romanly, child.'\n\n'He has heard it Romanly already, bebee; 'twas by that I found him out,\nas I told you.'\n\n'Halloo, sir, are you sleeping? you have taken drows; the gentleman makes\nno answer.  God give me patience!'\n\n'And what if he doesn't, bebee; isn't he poisoned like a hog?  Gentleman,\nindeed! why call him gentleman? if he ever was one he's broke, and is now\na tinker, a worker of blue metal.'\n\n'That's his way, child, to-day a tinker, to-morrow something else; and as\nfor being drabbed, I don't know what to say about it.'\n\n'Not drabbed! what do you mean, bebee? but look there, bebee; ha, ha,\nlook at the gentleman's motions.'\n\n'He is sick, child, sure enough.  Ho, ho! sir, you have taken drows;\nwhat, another throe! writhe, sir, writhe; the hog died by the drow of\ngypsies; I saw him stretched at evening.  That's yourself, sir.  There is\nno hope, sir, no help, you have taken drow; shall I tell you your\nfortune, sir, your dukkerin?  God bless you, pretty gentleman, much\ntrouble will you have to suffer, and much water to cross; but never mind,\npretty gentleman, you shall be fortunate at the end, and those who hate\nshall take off their hats to you.'\n\n'Hey, bebee!' cried the girl; 'what is this? what do you mean? you have\nblessed the gorgio!'\n\n'Blessed him! no, sure; what did I say?  Oh, I remember, I'm mad; well, I\ncan't help it, I said what the dukkerin dook told me; woe's me, he'll get\nup yet.'\n\n'Nonsense, bebee!  Look at his motions, he's drabbed, spite of dukkerin.'\n\n'Don't say so, child; he's sick, 'tis true, but don't laugh at dukkerin,\nonly folks do that that know no better.  I, for one, will never laugh at\nthe dukkerin dook.  Sick again; I wish he was gone.'\n\n'He'll soon be gone, bebee; let's leave him.  He's as good as gone; look\nthere, he's dead.'\n\n'No, he's not, he'll get up--I feel it; can't we hasten him?'\n\n'Hasten him! yes, to be sure; set the dog upon him.  Here, juggal, look\nin there, my dog.'\n\nThe dog made its appearance at the door of the tent, and began to bark\nand tear up the ground.\n\n'At him, juggal, at him; he wished to poison, to drab you.  Halloo!'\n\nThe dog barked violently, and seemed about to spring at my face, but\nretreated.\n\n'The dog won't fly at him, child; he flashed at the dog with his eye, and\nscared him.  He'll get up.'\n\n'Nonsense, bebee! you make me angry; how should he get up?'\n\n'The dook tells me so, and, what's more, I had a dream.  I thought I was\nat York, standing amidst a crowd to see a man hung, and the crowd\nshouted, \"There he comes!\" and I looked, and, lo! it was the tinker;\nbefore I could cry with joy I was whisked away, and I found myself in\nEly's big church, which was chock full of people to hear the dean preach,\nand all eyes were turned to the big pulpit; and presently I heard them\nsay, \"There he mounts!\" and I looked up to the big pulpit, and, lo! the\ntinker was in the pulpit, and he raised his arm and began to preach.\nAnon, I found myself at York again, just as the drop fell, and I looked\nup, and I saw not the tinker, but my own self hanging in the air.'\n\n'You are going mad, bebee; if you want to hasten him, take your stick and\npoke him in the eye.'\n\n'That will be of no use, child, the dukkerin tells me so; but I will try\nwhat I can do.  Halloo, tinker! you must introduce yourself into a quiet\nfamily, and raise confusion--must you?  You must steal its language, and,\nwhat was never done before, write it down Christianly--must you?  Take\nthat--and that'; and she stabbed violently with her stick towards the end\nof the tent.\n\n'That's right, bebee, you struck his face; now once more, and let it be\nin the eye.  Stay, what's that? get up, bebee.'\n\n'What's the matter, child?'\n\n'Some one is coming, come away.'\n\n'Let me make sure of him, child; he'll be up yet.'  And thereupon Mrs.\nHerne, rising, leaned forward into the tent, and, supporting herself\nagainst the pole, took aim in the direction of the farther end.  'I will\nthrust out his eye,' said she; and, lunging with her stick, she would\nprobably have accomplished her purpose had not at that moment the pole of\nthe tent given way, whereupon she fell to the ground, the canvas falling\nupon her and her intended victim.\n\n'Here's a pretty affair, bebee,' screamed the girl.\n\n'He'll get up, yet,' said Mrs. Herne, from beneath the canvas.\n\n'Get up!--get up yourself; where are you? where is your--Here, there,\nbebee, here's the door; there, make haste, they are coming.'\n\n'He'll get up yet,' said Mrs. Herne, recovering her breath; 'the dock\ntells me so.'\n\n'Never mind him or the dook; he is drabbed; come away, or we shall be\ngrabbed--both of us.'\n\n'One more blow, I know where his head lies.'\n\n'You are mad, bebee; leave the fellow--gorgio avella.'\n\nAnd thereupon the females hurried away.\n\nA vehicle of some kind was evidently drawing nigh; in a little time it\ncame alongside of the place where lay the fallen tent, and stopped\nsuddenly.  There was a silence for a moment, and then a parley ensued\nbetween two voices, one of which was that of a woman.  It was not in\nEnglish, but in a deep guttural tongue.\n\n'Peth yw hono sydd yn gorwedd yna ar y ddaear?' said a masculine voice.\n\n'Yn wirionedd--I do not know what it can be,' said the female voice, in\nthe same tongue.\n\n'Here is a cart, and there are tools; but what is that on the ground?'\n\n'Something moves beneath it; and what was that--a groan?'\n\n'Shall I get down?'\n\n'Of course, Peter, some one may want your help?\n\n'Then I will get down, though I do not like this place; it is frequented\nby Egyptians, and I do not like their yellow faces, nor their clibberty\nclabber, as Master Ellis Wyn says.  Now I am down.  It is a tent,\nWinifred, and see, here is a boy beneath it.  Merciful father! what a\nface.'\n\nA middle-aged man, with a strongly marked and serious countenance,\ndressed in sober-coloured habiliments, had lifted up the stifling folds\nof the tent, and was bending over me.  'Can you speak, my lad?' said he\nin English; 'what is the matter with you? if you could but tell me, I\ncould perhaps help you--'  'What is that you say?  I can't hear you.  I\nwill kneel down'; and he flung himself on the ground, and placed his ear\nclose to my mouth.  'Now speak if you can.  Hey! what! no, sure, God\nforbid!' then starting up, he cried to a female who sat in the cart,\nanxiously looking on--'Gwenwyn! gwenwyn! yw y gwas wedi ei gwenwynaw.  The\noil!  Winifred, the oil!'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII\n\n\nDesired effect--The three oaks--Winifred--Things of time--With God's\nwill--The preacher--Creature comforts--Croesaw--Welsh and English--Mayor\nof Chester.\n\nThe oil, which the strangers compelled me to take, produced the desired\neffect, though, during at least two hours, it was very doubtful whether\nor not my life would be saved.  At the end of that period the man said\nthat with the blessing of God he would answer for my life.  He then\ndemanded whether I thought I could bear to be removed from the place in\nwhich we were; 'for I like it not,' he continued, 'as something within me\ntells me that it is not good for any of us to be here.'  I told him, as\nwell as I was able, that I, too, should be glad to leave the place;\nwhereupon, after collecting my things, he harnessed my pony, and, with\nthe assistance of the woman, he contrived to place me in the cart; he\nthen gave me a draught out of a small phial, and we set forward at a slow\npace, the man walking by the side of the cart in which I lay.  It is\nprobable that the draught consisted of a strong opiate, for after\nswallowing it I fell into a deep slumber; on my awaking, I found that the\nshadows of night had enveloped the earth--we were still moving on.\nShortly, however, after descending a declivity, we turned into a lane, at\nthe entrance of which was a gate.  This lane conducted to a meadow,\nthrough the middle of which ran a small brook; it stood between two\nrising grounds; that on the left, which was on the farther side of the\nwater, was covered with wood, whilst the one on the right, which was not\nso high, was crowned with the white walls of what appeared to be a\nfarmhouse.\n\nAdvancing along the meadow, we presently came to a place where grew three\nimmense oaks, almost on the side of the brook, over which they flung\ntheir arms, so as to shade it as with a canopy; the ground beneath was\nbare of grass, and nearly as hard and smooth as the floor of a barn.\nHaving led his own cart on one side of the midmost tree, and my own on\nthe other, the stranger said to me, 'This is the spot where my wife and\nmyself generally tarry in the summer season, when we come into these\nparts.  We are about to pass the night here.  I suppose you will have no\nobjection to do the same?  Indeed, I do not see what else you could do\nunder present circumstances.'  After receiving my answer, in which I, of\ncourse, expressed my readiness to assent to his proposal, he proceeded to\nunharness his horse, and, feeling myself much better, I got down, and\nbegan to make the necessary preparations for passing the night beneath\nthe oak.\n\nWhilst thus engaged, I felt myself touched on the shoulder, and, looking\nround, perceived the woman, whom the stranger called Winifred, standing\nclose to me.  The moon was shining brightly upon her, and I observed that\nshe was very good-looking, with a composed yet cheerful expression of\ncountenance; her dress was plain and primitive, very much resembling that\nof a Quaker.  She held a straw bonnet in her hand.  'I am glad to see\nthee moving about, young man,' said she, in a soft, placid tone; 'I could\nscarcely have expected it.  Thou must be wondrous strong; many, after\nwhat thou hast suffered, would not have stood on their feet for weeks and\nmonths.  What do I say?--Peter, my husband, who is skilled in medicine,\njust now told me that not one in five hundred would have survived what\nthou hast this day undergone; but allow me to ask thee one thing, Hast\nthou returned thanks to God for thy deliverance?'  I made no answer, and\nthe woman, after a pause, said, 'Excuse me, young man, but do you know\nanything of God?'  'Very little,' I replied, 'but I should say He must be\na wondrous strong person, if He made all those big bright things up above\nthere, to say nothing of the ground on which we stand, which bears beings\nlike these oaks, each of which is fifty times as strong as myself, and\nwill live twenty times as long.'  The woman was silent for some moments,\nand then said, 'I scarcely know in what spirit thy words are uttered.  If\nthou art serious, however, I would caution thee against supposing that\nthe power of God is more manifested in these trees, or even in those\nbright stars above us, than in thyself--they are things of time, but thou\nart a being destined to an eternity; it depends upon thyself whether thy\neternity shall be one of joy or sorrow.'\n\nHere she was interrupted by the man, who exclaimed from the other side of\nthe tree, 'Winifred, it is getting late, you had better go up to the\nhouse on the hill to inform our friends of our arrival, or they will have\nretired for the night.'  'True,' said Winifred, and forthwith wended her\nway to the house in question, returning shortly with another woman, whom\nthe man, speaking in the same language which I had heard him first use,\ngreeted by the name of Mary; the woman replied in the same tongue, but\nalmost immediately said, in English, 'We hoped to have heard you speak to-\nnight, Peter, but we cannot expect that now, seeing that it is so late,\nowing to your having been detained by the way, as Winifred tells me;\nnothing remains for you to do now but to sup--to-morrow, with God's will,\nwe shall hear you.'  'And to-night, also, with God's will, provided you\nbe so disposed.  Let those of your family come hither.'  'They will be\nhither presently,' said Mary, 'for knowing that thou art arrived, they\nwill, of course, come and bid thee welcome.'  And scarcely had she spoke,\nwhen I beheld a party of people descending the moonlit side of the hill.\nThey soon arrived at the place where we were; they might amount in all to\ntwelve individuals.  The principal person was a tall, athletic man, of\nabout forty, dressed like a plain country farmer; this was, I soon found,\nthe husband of Mary; the rest of the group consisted of the children of\nthese two, and their domestic servants.  One after another they all shook\nPeter by the hand, men and women, boys and girls, and expressed their joy\nat seeing him.  After which he said, 'Now, friends, if you please, I will\nspeak a few words to you.'  A stool was then brought him from the cart,\nwhich he stepped on, and the people arranging themselves round him, some\nstanding, some seated on the ground, he forthwith began to address them\nin a clear, distinct voice; and the subject of his discourse was the\nnecessity, in all human beings, of a change of heart.\n\nThe preacher was better than his promise, for, instead of speaking a few\nwords, he preached for at least three-quarters of an hour; none of the\naudience, however, showed the slightest symptom of weariness; on the\ncontrary, the hope of each individual appeared to hang upon the words\nwhich proceeded from his mouth.  At the conclusion of the sermon or\ndiscourse the whole assembly again shook Peter by the hand, and returned\nto their house, the mistress of the family saying, as she departed, 'I\nshall soon be back, Peter; I go but to make arrangements for the supper\nof thyself and company'; and, in effect, she presently returned, attended\nby a young woman, who bore a tray in her hands.  'Set it down, Jessy,'\nsaid the mistress to the girl, 'and then betake thyself to thy rest, I\nshall remain here for a little time to talk with my friends.'  The girl\ndeparted, and the preacher and the two females placed themselves on the\nground about the tray.  The man gave thanks, and himself and his wife\nappeared to be about to eat, when the latter suddenly placed her hand\nupon his arm, and said something to him in a low voice, whereupon he\nexclaimed, 'Ay, truly, we were both forgetful'; and then getting up, he\ncame towards me, who stood a little way off, leaning against the wheel of\nmy cart; and, taking me by the hand, he said, 'Pardon us, young man, we\nwere both so engaged in our own creature-comforts, that we forgot thee,\nbut it is not too late to repair our fault; wilt thou not join us, and\ntaste our bread and milk?'  'I cannot eat,' I replied, 'but I think I\ncould drink a little milk'; whereupon he led me to the rest, and seating\nme by his side, he poured some milk into a horn cup, saying, '\"Croesaw.\"\nThat,' added he, with a smile, 'is Welsh for welcome.'\n\nThe fare upon the tray was of the simplest description, consisting of\nbread, cheese, milk, and curds.  My two friends partook with a good\nappetite.  'Mary,' said the preacher, addressing himself to the woman of\nthe house, 'every time I come to visit thee, I find thee less inclined to\nspeak Welsh.  I suppose, in a little time, thou wilt entirely have\nforgotten it; hast thou taught it to any of thy children?'  'The two\neldest understand a few words,' said the woman, 'but my husband does not\nwish them to learn it; he says sometimes, jocularly, that though it\npleased him to marry a Welsh wife, it does not please him to have Welsh\nchildren.  Who, I have heard him say, would be a Welshman, if he could be\nan Englishman?'  'I for one,' said the preacher, somewhat hastily; 'not\nto be king of all England would I give up my birthright as a Welshman.\nYour husband is an excellent person, Mary, but I am afraid he is somewhat\nprejudiced.'  'You do him justice, Peter, in saying that he is an\nexcellent person,' sail the woman; 'as to being prejudiced, I scarcely\nknow what to say, but he thinks that two languages in the same kingdom\nare almost as bad as two kings.'  'That's no bad observation,' said the\npreacher, 'and it is generally the case; yet, thank God, the Welsh and\nEnglish go on very well, side by side, and I hope will do so till the\nAlmighty calls all men to their long account.'  'They jog on very well\nnow,' said the woman; 'but I have heard my husband say that it was not\nalways so, and that the Welsh, in old times, were a violent and ferocious\npeople, for that once they hanged the mayor of Chester.'  'Ha, ha!' said\nthe preacher, and his eyes flashed in the moonlight; 'he told you that,\ndid he?'  'Yes,' said Mary; 'once, when the mayor of Chester, with some\nof his people, was present at one of the fairs over the border, a quarrel\narose between the Welsh and the English, and the Welsh beat the English,\nand hanged the mayor.'  'Your husband is a clever man,' said Peter, 'and\nknows a great deal; did he tell you the name of the leader of the Welsh?\nNo! then I will: the leader of the Welsh on that occasion was ---.  He\nwas a powerful chieftain, and there was an old feud between him and the\nmen of Chester.  Afterwards, when two hundred of the men of Chester\ninvaded his country to take revenge for their mayor, he enticed them into\na tower, set fire to it, and burnt them all.  That--was a very fine,\nnoble--God forgive me, what was I about to say--a very bad, violent man;\nbut, Mary, this is very carnal and unprofitable conversation, and in\nholding it we set a very bad example to the young man here--let us change\nthe subject.'\n\nThey then began to talk on religious matters.  At length Mary departed to\nher abode, and the preacher and his wife retired to their tilted cart.\n\n'Poor fellow, he seems to be almost brutally ignorant,' said Peter,\naddressing his wife in their native language, after they had bidden me\nfarewell for the night.\n\n'I am afraid he is,' said Winifred, 'yet my heart warms to the poor lad,\nhe seems so forlorn.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII\n\n\nMorning hymn--Much alone--John Bunyan--Beholden to\nnobody--Sixty-five--Sober greeting--Early Sabbaths--Finny brood--The\nporch--No fortune-telling--The master's niece--Doing good--Two or three\nthings--Groans and voices--Pechod Ysprydd Glan.\n\nI slept soundly during that night, partly owing to the influence of the\nopiate.  Early in the morning I was awakened by the voices of Peter and\nhis wife, who were singing a morning hymn in their own language.  Both\nsubsequently prayed long and fervently.  I lay still till their devotions\nwere completed, and then left my tent.  'Good morning,' said Peter, 'how\ndost thou feel?'  'Much better,' said I, 'than I could have expected.'  'I\nam glad of it,' said Peter.  'Art thou hungry? yonder comes our\nbreakfast,' pointing to the same young woman I had seen the preceding\nnight, who was again descending the hill bearing the tray upon her head.\n\n'What dust thou intend to do, young man, this day?' said Peter, when we\nhad about half finished breakfast.  'Do,' said I; 'as I do other days,\nwhat I can.'  'And dost thou pass this day as thou dost other days?' said\nPeter.  'Why not?' said I; 'what is there in this day different from the\nrest? it seems to be of the same colour as yesterday.'  'Art thou aware,'\nsaid the wife, interposing, 'what day it is? that it is Sabbath? that it\nis Sunday?'  'No,' said I, 'I did not know that it was Sunday.'  'And how\ndid that happen?' said Winifred, with a sigh.  'To tell you the truth,'\nsaid I, 'I live very much alone, and pay very little heed to the passing\nof time.'  'And yet of what infinite importance is time,' said Winifred.\n'Art thou not aware that every year brings thee nearer to thy end?'  'I\ndo not think,' said I, 'that I am so near my end as I was yesterday.'\n'Yes, thou art,' said the woman; 'thou wast not doomed to die yesterday;\nan invisible hand was watching over thee yesterday; but thy day will\ncome, therefore improve the time; be grateful that thou wast saved\nyesterday; and, oh! reflect on one thing; if thou hadst died yesterday,\nwhere wouldst thou have been now?'  'Cast into the earth, perhaps,' said\nI.  'I have heard Mr. Petulengro say that to be cast into the earth is\nthe natural end of man.'  'Who is Mr. Petulengro?' said Peter,\ninterrupting his wife, as she was about to speak.  'Master of the horse-\nshoe,' said I; 'and, according to his own account, king of Egypt.'  'I\nunderstand,' said Peter, 'head of some family of wandering Egyptians--they\nare a race utterly godless.  Art thou of them?--but no, thou art not,\nthou hast not their yellow blood.  I suppose thou belongest to the family\nof wandering artisans called ---.  I do not like you the worse for\nbelonging to them.  A mighty speaker of old sprang up from amidst that\nfamily.'  'Who was he?' said I.  'John Bunyan,' replied Peter,\nreverently, 'and the mention of his name reminds me that I have to preach\nthis day; wilt thou go and hear? the distance is not great, only half a\nmile.'  'No,' said I, 'I will not go and hear.'  'Wherefore?' said Peter.\n'I belong to the church,' said I, 'and not to the congregations.'  'Oh!\nthe pride of that church,' said Peter, addressing his wife in their own\ntongue, 'exemplified even in the lowest and most ignorant of its members.\nThen thou, doubtless, meanest to go to church,' said Peter, again\naddressing me; 'there is a church on the other side of that wooded hill.'\n'No,' said I, 'I do not mean to go to church.'  'May I ask thee\nwherefore?' said Peter.  'Because,' said I, 'I prefer remaining beneath\nthe shade of these trees, listening to the sound of the leaves and the\ntinkling of the waters.'\n\n'Then thou intendest to remain here?' said Peter, looking fixedly at me.\n'If I do not intrude,' said I; 'but if I do, I will wander away; I wish\nto be beholden to nobody--perhaps you wish me to go?'  'On the contrary,'\nsaid Peter, 'I wish you to stay.  I begin to see something in thee which\nhas much interest for me; but we must now bid thee farewell for the rest\nof the day, the time is drawing nigh for us to repair to the place of\npreaching; before we leave thee alone, however, I should wish to ask thee\na question--Didst thou seek thy own destruction yesterday, and didst thou\nwilfully take that poison?'  'No,' said I; 'had I known there had been\npoison in the cake I certainly should not have taken it.'  'And who gave\nit thee?' said Peter.  'An enemy of mine,' I replied.  'Who is thy\nenemy?'  'An Egyptian sorceress and poison-monger.'  'Thy enemy is a\nfemale.  I fear thou hadst given her cause to hate thee--of what did she\ncomplain?'  'That I had stolen the tongue out of her head.'  'I do not\nunderstand thee--is she young?'  'About sixty-five.'\n\nHere Winifred interposed.  'Thou didst call her just now by hard names,\nyoung man,' said she; 'I trust thou dost bear no malice against her.'\n'No,' said I, 'I bear no malice against her.'  'Thou art not wishing to\ndeliver her into the hand of what is called justice?'  'By no means,'\nsaid I; 'I have lived long enough upon the roads not to cry out for the\nconstable when my finger is broken.  I consider this poisoning as an\naccident of the roads; one of those to which those who travel are\noccasionally subject.'  'In short, thou forgivest thine adversary?'  'Both\nnow and for ever,' said I.  'Truly,' said Winifred, 'the spirit which the\nyoung man displayeth pleases me much; I should be loth that he left us\nyet.  I have no doubt that, with the blessing of God, and a little of thy\nexhortation, he will turn out a true Christian before he leaveth us.'  'My\nexhortation!' said Peter, and a dark shade passed over his countenance;\n'thou forgettest what I am--I--I--but I am forgetting myself; the Lord's\nwill be done; and now put away the things, for I perceive that our\nfriends are coming to attend us to the place of meeting.'\n\nAgain the family which I had seen the night before descended the hill\nfrom their abode.  They were now dressed in their Sunday's best.  The\nmaster of the house led the way.  They presently joined us, when a quiet\nsober greeting ensued on each side.  After a little time Peter shook me\nby the hand and bade me farewell till the evening; Winifred did the same,\nadding that she hoped I should be visited by sweet and holy thoughts.  The\nwhole party then moved off in the direction by which we had come the\npreceding night, Peter and the master leading the way, followed by\nWinifred and the mistress of the family.  As I gazed on their departing\nforms, I felt almost inclined to follow them to their place of worship.  I\ndid not stir, however, but remained leaning against my oak with my hands\nbehind me.\n\nAnd after a time I sat me down at the foot of the oak with my face turned\ntowards the water, and, folding my hands, I fell into deep meditation.  I\nthought on the early Sabbaths of my life, and the manner in which I was\nwont to pass them.  How carefully I said my prayers when I got up on the\nSabbath morn, and how carefully I combed my hair and brushed my clothes\nin order that I might do credit to the Sabbath day.  I thought of the old\nchurch at pretty D---, the dignified rector, and yet more dignified\nclerk.  I though of England's grand Liturgy, and Tate and Brady's\nsonorous minstrelsy.  I thought of the Holy Book, portions of which I was\nin the habit of reading between service.  I thought, too, of the evening\nwalk which I sometimes took in fine weather like the present, with my\nmother and brother--a quiet sober walk, during which I would not break\ninto a run, even to chase a butterfly, or yet more a honey-bee, being\nfully convinced of the dread importance of the day which God had\nhallowed.  And how glad I was when I had got over the Sabbath day without\nhaving done anything to profane it.  And how soundly I slept on the\nSabbath night after the toil of being very good throughout the day.\n\nAnd when I had mused on those times a long while, I sighed and said to\nmyself, I am much altered since then; am I altered for the better?  And\nthen I looked at my hands and my apparel, and sighed again.  I was not\nwont of yore to appear thus on the Sabbath day.\n\nFor a long time I continued in a state of deep meditation, till at last I\nlifted up my eyes to the sun, which, as usual during that glorious\nsummer, was shining in unclouded majesty; and then I lowered them to the\nsparkling water, in which hundreds of the finny brood were disporting\nthemselves, and then I thought what a fine thing it was to be a fish on\nsuch a fine summer day, and I wished myself a fish, or at least amongst\nthe fishes; and then I looked at my hands again, and then, bending over\nthe water, I looked at my face in the crystal mirror, and started when I\nsaw it, for it looked squalid and miserable.\n\nForthwith I started up, and said to myself, I should like to bathe and\ncleanse myself from the squalor produced by my late hard life and by Mrs.\nHerne's drow.  I wonder if there is any harm in bathing on the Sabbath\nday.  I will ask Winifred when she comes home; in the meantime I will\nbathe, provided I can find a fitting place.\n\nBut the brook, though a very delightful place for fish to disport in, was\nshallow, and by no means adapted for the recreation of so large a being\nas myself; it was, moreover, exposed, though I saw nobody at hand, nor\nheard a single human voice or sound.  Following the winding of the brook,\nI left the meadow, and, passing through two or three thickets, came to a\nplace where between lofty banks the water ran deep and dark, and there I\nbathed, imbibing new tone and vigour into my languid and exhausted frame.\n\nHaving put on my clothes, I returned by the way I had come to my vehicle\nbeneath the oak tree.  From thence, for want of something better to do, I\nstrolled up the hill, on the top of which stood the farm-house; it was a\nlarge and commodious building built principally of stone, and seeming of\nsome antiquity, with a porch, on either side of which was an oaken bench.\nOn the right was seated a young woman with a book in her hand, the same\nwho had brought the tray to my friends and myself.\n\n'Good-day,' said I, 'pretty damsel, sitting in the farm porch.'\n\n'Good-day,' said the girl, looking at me for a moment, and then fixing\nher eyes on her book.\n\n'That's a nice book you are reading,' said I.\n\nThe girl looked at me with surprise.  'How do you know what book it is?'\nsaid she.\n\n'How do I know--never mind; but a nice book it is--no love, no fortune-\ntelling in it.'\n\nThe girl looked at me half offended.  'Fortune-telling!' said she, 'I\nshould think not.  But you know nothing about it'; and she bent her head\nonce more over the book.\n\n'I tell you what, young person,' said I, 'I know all about that book;\nwhat will you wager that I do not?'\n\n'I never wager,' said the girl.\n\n'Shall I tell you the name of it,' said I, 'O daughter of the dairy? '\n\nThe girl half started.  'I should never have thought,' said she, half\ntimidly, 'that you could have guessed it.'\n\n'I did not guess it,' said I, 'I knew it; and meet and proper it is that\nyou should read it.'\n\n'Why so?' said the girl.\n\n'Can the daughter of the dairy read a more fitting book than the\n_Dairyman's Daughter_?'\n\n'Where do you come from?' said the girl.\n\n'Out of the water,' said I.  'Don't start, I have been bathing; are you\nfond of the water?'\n\n'No,' said the girl, heaving a sigh; 'I am not fond of the water, that\nis, of the sea'; and here she sighed again.\n\n'The sea is a wide gulf,' said I, 'and frequently separates hearts.'\n\nThe girl sobbed.\n\n'Why are you alone here?' said I.\n\n'I take my turn with the rest,' said the girl, 'to keep at home on\nSunday.'\n\n'And you are--' said I.\n\n'The master's niece!' said the girl.  'How came you to know it?  But why\ndid you not go with the rest and with your friends?'\n\n'Who are those you call my friends?' said I.\n\n'Peter and his wife.'\n\n'And who are they?' said I.\n\n'Do you not know?' said the girl; 'you came with them.'\n\n'They found me ill by the way,' said I; 'and they relieved me: I know\nnothing about them.'\n\n'I thought you knew everything,' said the girl.\n\n'There are two or three things which I do not know, and this is one of\nthem.  Who are they?'\n\n'Did you never hear of the great Welsh preacher, Peter Williams?'\n\n'Never,' said I.\n\n'Well,' said the girl, 'this is he, and Winifred is his wife, and a nice\nperson she is.  Some people say, indeed, that she is as good a preacher\nas her husband, though of that matter I can say nothing, having never\nheard her preach.  So these two wander over all Wales and the greater\npart of England, comforting the hearts of the people with their doctrine,\nand doing all the good they can.  They frequently come here, for the\nmistress is a Welsh woman, and an old friend of both, and then they take\nup their abode in the cart beneath the old oaks down there by the\nstream.'\n\n'And what is their reason for doing so?' said I; 'would it not be more\ncomfortable to sleep beneath a roof?'\n\n'I know not their reasons,' said the girl, 'but so it is; they never\nsleep beneath a roof unless the weather is very severe.  I once heard the\nmistress say that Peter had something heavy upon his mind; perhaps that\nis the cause.  If he is unhappy, all I can say is, that I wish him\notherwise, for he is a good man and a kind--'\n\n'Thank you,' said I, 'I will now depart.'\n\n'Hem!' said the girl, 'I was wishing--'\n\n'What? to ask me a question?'\n\n'Not exactly; but you seem to know everything; you mentioned, I think,\nfortune-telling.'\n\n'Do you wish me to tell your fortune?'\n\n'By no means; but I have a friend at a distance at sea, and I should wish\nto know--'\n\n'When he will come back?  I have told you already there are two or three\nthings which I do not know--this is another of them.  However, I should\nnot be surprised if he were to come back some of these days; I would if I\nwere in his place.  In the meantime be patient, attend to the dairy, and\nread the _Dairyman's Daughter_ when you have nothing better to do.'\n\nIt was late in the evening when the party of the morning returned.  The\nfarmer and his family repaired at once to their abode, and my two friends\njoined me beneath the tree.  Peter sat down at the foot of the oak, and\nsaid nothing.  Supper was brought by a servant, not the damsel of the\nporch.  We sat round the tray, Peter said grace, but scarcely anything\nelse; he appeared sad and dejected, his wife looked anxiously upon him.  I\nwas as silent as my friends; after a little time we retired to our\nseparate places of rest.\n\nAbout midnight I was awakened by a noise; I started up and listened; it\nappeared to me that I heard voices and groans.  In a moment I had issued\nfrom my tent--all was silent--but the next moment I again heard groans\nand voices; they proceeded from the tilted cart where Peter and his wife\nlay; I drew near, again there was a pause, and then I heard the voice of\nPeter, in an accent of extreme anguish, exclaim, 'Pechod Ysprydd Glan--O\npechod Ysprydd Glan!' and then he uttered a deep groan.  Anon, I heard\nthe voice of Winifred, and never shall I forget the sweetness and\ngentleness of the tones of her voice in the stillness of that night.  I\ndid not understand all she said--she spoke in her native language, and I\nwas some way apart; she appeared to endeavour to console her husband, but\nhe seemed to refuse all comfort, and, with many groans, repeated--'Pechod\nYsprydd Glan--O pechod Ysprydd Glan!'  I felt I had no right to pry into\ntheir afflictions, and retired.\n\nNow 'pechod Ysprydd Glan,' interpreted, is the sin against the Holy\nGhost.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV\n\n\nThe following day--Pride--Thriving trade--Tylwyth Teg--Ellis Wyn--Sleeping\nhard--Incalculable good--Fearful agony--The tale.\n\nPeter and his wife did not proceed on any expedition during the following\nday.  The former strolled gloomily about the fields, and the latter\npassed many hours in the farmhouse.  Towards evening, without saying a\nword to either, I departed with my vehicle, and finding my way to a small\ntown at some distance, I laid in a store of various articles, with which\nI returned.  It was night, and my two friends were seated beneath the\noak; they had just completed their frugal supper.  'We waited for thee\nsome time,' said Winifred, 'but, finding that thou didst not come, we\nbegan without thee; but sit down, I pray thee, there is still enough for\nthee.'  'I will sit down,' said I, 'but I require no supper, for I have\neaten where I have been': nothing more particular occurred at the time.\nNext morning the kind pair invited me to share their breakfast.  'I will\nnot share your breakfast,' said I.  'Wherefore not?' said Winifred,\nanxiously.  'Because,' said I, 'it is not proper that I be beholden to\nyou for meat and drink.'  'But we are beholden to other people,' said\nWinifred.  'Yes,' said I, 'but you preach to them, and give them ghostly\nadvice, which considerably alters the matter; not that I would receive\nanything from them, if I preached to them six times a day.'  'Thou art\nnot fond of receiving favours, then, young man,' said Winifred.  'I am\nnot,' said I.  'And of conferring favours?'  'Nothing affords me greater\npleasure,' said I, 'than to confer favours.'  'What a disposition,' said\nWinifred, holding up her hands; 'and this is pride, genuine pride--that\nfeeling which the world agrees to call so noble.  Oh, how mean a thing is\npride! never before did I see all the meanness of what is called pride!'\n\n'But how wilt thou live, friend,' said Peter; 'dost thou not intend to\neat?'  'When I went out last night,' said I, 'I laid in a provision.'\n'Thou hast laid in a provision!' said Peter, 'pray let us see it.  Really,\nfriend,' said he, after I had produced it, 'thou must drive a thriving\ntrade; here are provisions enough to last three people for several days.\nHere are butter and eggs, here is tea, here is sugar, and there is a\nflitch.  I hope thou wilt let us partake of some of thy fare.'  'I should\nbe very happy if you would,' said I.  'Doubt not but we shall,' said\nPeter; 'Winifred shall have some of thy flitch cooked for dinner.  In the\nmeantime, sit down, young man, and breakfast at our expense--we will dine\nat thine.'\n\nOn the evening of that day, Peter and myself sat alone beneath the oak.\nWe fell into conversation; Peter was at first melancholy, but he soon\nbecame more cheerful, fluent, and entertaining.  I spoke but little; but\nI observed that sometimes what I said surprised the good Methodist.  We\nhad been silent some time.  At length, lifting up my eyes to the broad\nand leafy canopy of the trees, I said, having nothing better to remark,\n'What a noble tree!  I wonder if the fairies ever dance beneath it.'\n\n'Fairies!' said Peter, 'fairies! how came you, young man, to know\nanything about the fair family?'\n\n'I am an Englishman,' said I, 'and of course know something about\nfairies; England was once a famous place for them.'\n\n'Was once, I grant you,' said Peter, 'but is so no longer.  I have\ntravelled for years about England, and never heard them mentioned before;\nthe belief in them has died away, and even their name seems to be\nforgotten.  If you had said you were a Welshman, I should not have been\nsurprised.  The Welsh have much to say of the Tylwyth Teg, or fair\nfamily, and many believe in them.'\n\n'And do you believe in them?' said I.\n\n'I scarcely know what to say.  Wise and good men have been of opinion\nthat they are nothing but devils, who, under the form of pretty and\namiable spirits, would fain allure poor human beings; I see nothing\nirrational in the supposition.'\n\n'Do you believe in devils, then?'\n\n'Do I believe in devils, young man?' said Peter, and his frame was shaken\nas if by convulsions.  'If I do not believe in devils, why am I here at\nthe present moment?'\n\n'You know best,' said I; 'but I don't believe that fairies are devils,\nand I don't wish to hear them insulted.  What learned men have said they\nare devils?'\n\n'Many have said it, young man, and, amongst others, Master Ellis Wyn, in\nthat wonderful book of his, the _Bardd Cwsg_.'\n\n'The _Bardd Cwsg_,' said I; 'what kind of book is that?  I have never\nheard of that book before.'\n\n'Heard of it before; I suppose not; how should you have heard of it\nbefore?  By the bye, can you read?'\n\n'Very tolerably,' said I; 'so there are fairies in this book.  What do\nyou call it--the _Bardd Cwsg_?'\n\n'Yes, the _Bardd Cwsg_.  You pronounce Welsh very fairly; have you ever\nbeen in Wales?'\n\n'Never,' said I.\n\n'Not been in Wales; then, of course, you don't understand Welsh; but we\nwere talking of the _Bardd Cwsg_--yes, there are fairies in the _Bardd\nCwsg_,--the author of it, Master Ellis Wyn, was carried away in his sleep\nby them over mountains and valleys, rivers and great waters, incurring\nmighty perils at their hands, till he was rescued from them by an angel\nof the Most High, who subsequently showed him many wonderful things.'\n\n'I beg your pardon,' said I, 'but what were those wonderful things?'\n\n'I see, young man,' said Peter, smiling, 'that you are not without\ncuriosity; but I can easily pardon any one for being curious about the\nwonders contained in the book of Master Ellis Wyn.  The angel showed him\nthe course of this world, its pomps and vanities, its cruelty and its\npride, its crimes and deceits.  On another occasion, the angel showed him\nDeath in his nether palace, surrounded by his grisly ministers, and by\nthose who are continually falling victims to his power.  And, on a third\noccasion, the state of the condemned in their place of everlasting\ntorment.'\n\n'But this was all in his sleep,' said I, 'was it not?'\n\n'Yes,' said Peter, 'in his sleep; and on that account the book is called\n_Gweledigaethau y Bardd Cwsg_, or, _Visions of the Sleeping Bard_.'\n\n'I do not care for wonders which occur in sleep,' said I.  'I prefer real\nones; and perhaps, notwithstanding what he says, the man had no visions\nat all--they are probably of his own invention.'\n\n'They are substantially true, young man,' said Peter; 'like the dreams of\nBunyan, they are founded on three tremendous facts, Sin, Death, and Hell;\nand like his they have done incalculable good, at least in my own\ncountry, in the language of which they are written.  Many a guilty\nconscience has the _Bardd Cwsg_ aroused with its dreadful sights, its\nstrong sighs, its puffs of smoke from the pit, and its showers of sparks\nfrom the mouth of the yet lower gulf of--Unknown--were it not for the\n_Bardd Cwsg_ perhaps I might not be here.'\n\n'I would sooner hear your own tale,' said I, 'than all the visions of the\n_Bardd Cwsg_.'\n\nPeter shook, bent his form nearly double, and covered his face with his\nhands.  I sat still and motionless, with my eyes fixed upon him.\nPresently Winifred descended the hill, and joined us.  'What is the\nmatter?' said she, looking at her husband, who still remained in the\nposture I have described.  He made no answer; whereupon, laying her hand\ngently on his shoulder, she said, in the peculiar soft and tender tone\nwhich I had heard her use on a former occasion, 'Take comfort, Peter;\nwhat has happened now to afflict thee?'  Peter removed his hand from his\nface.  'The old pain, the old pain,' said he; 'I was talking with this\nyoung man, and he would fain know what brought me here, he would fain\nhear my tale, Winifred--my sin: O pechod Ysprydd Glan!  O pechod Ysprydd\nGlan!' and the poor man fell into a more fearful agony than before.  Tears\ntrickled down Winifred's face, I saw them trickling by the moonlight, as\nshe gazed upon the writhing form of her afflicted husband.  I arose from\nmy seat.  'I am the cause of all this,' said I, 'by my folly and\nimprudence, and it is thus I have returned your kindness and hospitality;\nI will depart from you and wander my way.'  I was retiring, but Peter\nsprang up and detained me.  'Go not,' said he, 'you were not in fault; if\nthere be any fault in the case it was mine; if I suffer, I am but paying\nthe penalty of my own iniquity'; he then paused, and appeared to be\nconsidering: at length he said, 'Many things which thou hast seen and\nheard connected with me require explanation; thou wishest to know my\ntale, I will tell it thee, but not now, not to-night; I am too much\nshaken.'\n\nTwo evenings later, when we were again seated beneath the oak, Peter took\nthe hand of his wife in his own, and then, in tones broken and almost\ninarticulate, commenced telling me his tale--the tale of the Pechod\nYsprydd Glan.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV\n\n\nTaking a cup--Getting to heaven--After breakfast-- Wooden\ngallery--Mechanical habit--Reserved and gloomy--Last words--A long\ntime--From the clouds--Ray of hope--Momentary chill--Pleasing\nanticipation.\n\n'I was born in the heart of North Wales, the son of a respectable farmer,\nand am the youngest of seven brothers.\n\n'My father was a member of the Church of England, and was what is\ngenerally called a serious man.  He went to church regularly, and read\nthe Bible every Sunday evening; in his moments of leisure he was fond of\nholding religious discourse both with his family and his neighbours.\n\n'One autumn afternoon, on a week day, my father sat with one of his\nneighbours taking a cup of ale by the oak table in our stone kitchen.  I\nsat near them, and listened to their discourse.  I was at that time seven\nyears of age.  They were talking of religious matters.  \"It is a hard\nmatter to get to heaven,\" said my father.  \"Exceedingly so,\" said the\nother.  \"However, I don't despond; none need despair of getting to\nheaven, save those who have committed the sin against the Holy Ghost.\"\n\n'\"Ah!\" said my father, \"thank God I never committed that--how awful must\nbe the state of a person who has committed the sin against the Holy\nGhost.  I can scarcely think of it without my hair standing on end\"; and\nthen my father and his friend began talking of the nature of the sin\nagainst the Holy Ghost, and I heard them say what it was, as I sat with\ngreedy ears listening to their discourse.\n\n'I lay awake the greater part of the night musing upon what I had heard.\nI kept wondering to myself what must be the state of a person who had\ncommitted the sin against the Holy Ghost, and how he must feel.  Once or\ntwice I felt a strong inclination to commit it, a strange kind of fear,\nhowever, prevented me; at last I determined not to commit it, and, having\nsaid my prayers, I fell asleep.\n\n'When I awoke in the morning the first thing I thought of was the\nmysterious sin, and a voice within me seemed to say, \"Commit it\"; and I\nfelt a strong temptation to do so, even stronger than in the night.  I\nwas just about to yield, when the same dread, of which I have already\nspoken, came over me, and, springing out of bed, I went down on my knees.\nI slept in a small room alone, to which I ascended by a wooden stair,\nopen to the sky.  I have often thought since that it is not a good thing\nfor children to sleep alone.\n\n'After breakfast I went to school, and endeavoured to employ myself upon\nmy tasks, but all in vain; I could think of nothing but the sin against\nthe Holy Ghost; my eyes, instead of being fixed upon my book, wandered in\nvacancy.  My master observed my inattention, and chid me.  The time came\nfor saying my task, and I had not acquired it.  My master reproached me,\nand, yet more, he beat me; I felt shame and anger, and I went home with a\nfull determination to commit the sin against the Holy Ghost.\n\n'But when I got home my father ordered me to do something connected with\nthe farm, so that I was compelled to exert myself; I was occupied till\nnight, and was so busy that I almost forgot the sin and my late\nresolution.  My work completed, I took my supper, and went to my room; I\nbegan my prayers, and, when they were ended, I thought of the sin, but\nthe temptation was slight, I felt very tired, and was presently asleep.\n\n'Thus, you see, I had plenty of time allotted me by a gracious and kind\nGod to reflect on what I was about to do.  He did not permit the enemy of\nsouls to take me by surprise, and to hurry me at once into the commission\nof that which was to be my ruin here and hereafter.  Whatever I did was\nof my own free will, after I had had time to reflect.  Thus God is\njustified; He had no hand in my destruction, but, on the contrary, He did\nall that was compatible with justice to prevent it.  I hasten to the\nfatal moment.  Awaking in the night, I determined that nothing should\nprevent my committing the sin.  Arising from my bed, I went out upon the\nwooden gallery; and having stood for a few moments looking at the stars,\nwith which the heavens were thickly strewn, I laid myself down, and\nsupporting my face with my hand, I murmured out words of horror, words\nnot to be repeated, and in this manner I committed the sin against the\nHoly Ghost.\n\n'When the words were uttered I sat up upon the topmost step of the\ngallery; for some time I felt stunned in somewhat the same manner as I\nonce subsequently felt after being stung by an adder.  I soon arose,\nhowever, and retired to my bed, where, notwithstanding what I had done, I\nwas not slow in falling asleep.\n\n'I awoke several times during the night, each time with the dim idea that\nsomething strange and monstrous had occurred, but I presently fell asleep\nagain; in the morning I awoke with the same vague feeling, but presently\nrecollection returned, and I remembered that I had committed the sin\nagainst the Holy Ghost.  I lay musing for some time on what I had done,\nand I felt rather stunned, as before; at last I arose and got out of bed,\ndressed myself, and then went down on my knees, and was about to pray\nfrom the force of mechanical habit; before I said a word, however, I\nrecollected myself, and got up again.  What was the use of praying?  I\nthought; I had committed the sin against the Holy Ghost.\n\n'I went to school, but sat stupefied.  I was again chidden, again beaten,\nby my master.  I felt no anger this time, and scarcely heeded the\nstrokes.  I looked, however, at my master's face, and thought to myself,\nyou are beating me for being idle, as you suppose; poor man, what would\nyou do if you knew I had committed the sin against the Holy Ghost?\n\n'Days and weeks passed by.  I had once been cheerful, and fond of the\nsociety of children of my own age; but I was now reserved and gloomy.  It\nseemed to me that a gulf separated me from all my fellow-creatures.  I\nused to look at my brothers and schoolfellows, and think how different I\nwas from them; they had not done what I had.  I seemed, in my own eyes, a\nlone monstrous being, and yet, strange to say, I felt a kind of pride in\nbeing so.  I was unhappy, but I frequently thought to myself, I have done\nwhat no one else would dare to do; there was something grand in the idea;\nI had yet to learn the horror of my condition.\n\n'Time passed on, and I began to think less of what I had done; I began\nonce more to take pleasure in my childish sports; I was active, and\nexcelled at football and the like all the lads of my age.  I likewise\nbegan, what I had never done before, to take pleasure in the exercises of\nthe school.  I made great progress in Welsh and English grammar, and\nlearnt to construe Latin.  My master no longer chid or beat me, but one\nday told my father that he had no doubt that one day I should be an\nhonour to Wales.\n\n'Shortly after this my father fell sick; the progress of the disorder was\nrapid; feeling his end approaching, he called his children before him.\nAfter tenderly embracing us, he said \"God bless you, my children, I am\ngoing from you, but take comfort, I trust that we shall all meet again in\nheaven.\"\n\n'As he uttered these last words, horror took entire possession of me.\nMeet my father in heaven,--how could I ever hope to meet him there?  I\nlooked wildly at my brethren and at my mother; they were all bathed in\ntears, but how I envied them.  They might hope to meet my father in\nheaven, but how different were they from me, they had never committed the\nunpardonable sin.\n\n'In a few days my father died; he left his family in comfortable\ncircumstances, at least such as would be considered so in Wales, where\nthe wants of the people are few.  My elder brother carried on the farm\nfor the benefit of my mother and us all.  In course of time my brothers\nwere put out to various trades.  I still remained at school, but without\nbeing a source of expense to my relations, as I was by this time able to\nassist my master in the business of the school.\n\n'I was diligent both in self-improvement and in the instruction of\nothers; nevertheless, a horrible weight pressed upon my breast; I knew I\nwas a lost being; that for me there was no hope; that, though all others\nmight be saved, I must of necessity be lost; I had committed the\nunpardonable sin, for which I was doomed to eternal punishment, in the\nflaming gulf, as soon as life was over!--and how long could I hope to\nlive? perhaps fifty years; at the end of which I must go to my place; and\nthen I would count the months and the days, nay, even the hours, which\nyet intervened between me and my doom.  Sometimes I would comfort myself\nwith the idea that a long time would elapse before my time would be out;\nbut then again I thought that, however long the term might be, it must be\nout at last; and then I would fall into an agony, during which I would\nalmost wish that the term were out, and that I were in my place; the\nhorrors of which I thought could scarcely be worse than what I then\nendured.\n\n'There was one thought about this time which caused me unutterable grief\nand shame, perhaps more shame than grief.  It was that my father, who was\ngone to heaven, and was there daily holding communion with his God, was\nby this time aware of my crime.  I imagined him looking down from the\nclouds upon his wretched son, with a countenance of inexpressible horror.\nWhen this idea was upon me, I would often rush to some secret place to\nhide myself; to some thicket, where I would cast myself on the ground,\nand thrust my head into a thick bush, in order to escape from the horror-\nstruck glance of my father above in the clouds; and there I would\ncontinue groaning till the agony had, in some degree, passed away.\n\n'The wretchedness of my state increasing daily, it at last became\napparent to the master of the school, who questioned me earnestly and\naffectionately.  I, however, gave him no satisfactory answer, being\napprehensive that, if I unbosomed myself, I should become as much an\nobject of horror to him as I had long been to myself.  At length he\nsuspected that I was unsettled in my intellects; and, fearing probably\nthe ill effect of my presence upon his scholars, he advised me to go\nhome; which I was glad to do, as I felt myself every day becoming less\nqualified for the duties of the office which I had undertaken.\n\n'So I returned home to my mother and my brother, who received me with the\ngreatest kindness and affection.  I now determined to devote myself to\nhusbandry, and assist my brother in the business of the farm.  I was\nstill, however, very much distressed.  One fine morning, however, as I\nwas at work in the field, and the birds were carolling around me, a ray\nof hope began to break upon my poor dark soul.  I looked at the earth and\nlooked at the sky, and felt as I had not done for many a year; presently\na delicious feeling stole over me.  I was beginning to enjoy existence.  I\nshall never forget that hour.  I flung myself on the soil, and kissed it;\nthen, springing up with a sudden impulse, I rushed into the depths of a\nneighbouring wood, and, falling upon my knees, did what I had not done\nfor a long, long time--prayed to God.\n\n'A change, an entire change, seemed to have come over me.  I was no\nlonger gloomy and despairing, but gay and happy.  My slumbers were light\nand easy; not disturbed, as before, by frightful dreams.  I arose with\nthe lark, and like him uttered a cheerful song of praise to God,\nfrequently and earnestly, and was particularly cautious not to do\nanything which I considered might cause His displeasure.\n\n'At church I was constant, and when there listened with deepest attention\nto every word which proceeded from the mouth of the minister.  In a\nlittle time it appeared to me that I had become a good, very good, young\nman.  At times the recollection of the sin would return, and I would feel\na momentary chill; but the thought quickly vanished, and I again felt\nhappy and secure.\n\n'One Sunday morning, after I had said my prayers, I felt particularly\njoyous.  I thought of the innocent and virtuous life I was leading; and\nwhen the recollection of the sin intruded for a moment, said, \"I am sure\nGod will never utterly cast away so good a creature as myself.\"  I went\nto church, and was as usual attentive.  The subject of the sermon was on\nthe duty of searching the Scriptures: all I knew of them was from the\nliturgy.  I now, however, determined to read them, and perfect the good\nwork which I had begun.  My father's Bible was upon the shelf, and on\nthat evening I took it with me to my chamber.  I placed it on the table,\nand sat down.  My heart was filled with pleasing anticipation.  I opened\nthe book at random, and began to read; the first passage on which my eyes\nlighted was the following:--\n\n'\"He who committeth the sin against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven,\neither in this world or the next.\"'\n\nHere Peter was seized with convulsive tremors.  Winifred sobbed\nviolently.  I got up, and went away.  Returning in about a quarter of an\nhour, I found him more calm; he motioned me to sit down; and, after a\nshort pause, continued his narration.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI\n\n\nHasty farewell--Lofty rock--Wrestlings of Jacob--No rest--Ways of\nProvidence--Two females--Foot of the Cross--Enemy of\nsouls--Perplexed--Lucky hour--Valetudinarian--Methodists--Fervent in\nprayer--You Saxons--Weak creatures--Very agreeable--Almost happy--Kindness\nand solicitude.\n\n'Where was I, young man?  Oh, I remember, at the fatal passage which\nremoved all hope.  I will not dwell on what I felt.  I closed my eyes,\nand wished that I might be dreaming; but it was no dream, but a terrific\nreality: I will not dwell on that period, I should only shock you.  I\ncould not bear my feelings; so, bidding my friends a hasty farewell, I\nabandoned myself to horror and despair, and ran wild through Wales,\nclimbing mountains and wading streams.\n\n'Climbing mountains and wading streams, I ran wild about, I was burnt by\nthe sun, drenched by the rain, and had frequently at night no other\ncovering than the sky, or the humid roof of some cave; but nothing seemed\nto affect my constitution; probably the fire which burned within me\ncounteracted what I suffered from without.  During the space of three\nyears I scarcely knew what befell me; my life was a dream--a wild,\nhorrible dream; more than once I believe I was in the hands of robbers,\nand once in the hands of gypsies.  I liked the last description of people\nleast of all; I could not abide their yellow faces, or their ceaseless\nclabber.  Escaping from these beings, whose countenances and godless\ndiscourse brought to my mind the demons of the deep Unknown, I still ran\nwild through Wales, I know not how long.  On one occasion, coming in some\ndegree to my recollection, I felt myself quite unable to bear the horrors\nof my situation; looking round I found myself near the sea; instantly the\nidea came into my head that I would cast myself into it, and thus\nanticipate my final doom.  I hesitated a moment, but a voice within me\nseemed to tell me that I could do no better; the sea was near, and I\ncould not swim, so I determined to fling myself into the sea.  As I was\nrunning along at great speed, in the direction of a lofty rock, which\nbeetled over the waters, I suddenly felt myself seized by the coat.  I\nstrove to tear myself away, but in vain; looking round, I perceived a\nvenerable hale old man, who had hold of me.  \"Let me go!\" said I,\nfiercely.  \"I will not let thee go,\" said the old man, and now, instead\nof with one, he grappled me with both hands.  \"In whose name dost thou\ndetain me?\" said I, scarcely knowing what I said.  \"In the name of my\nMaster, who made thee and yonder sea; and has said to the sea, So far\nshalt thou come, and no farther, and to thee, Thou shalt do no murder.\"\n\"Has not a man a right to do what he pleases with his own?\" said I.  \"He\nhas,\" said the old man, \"but thy life is not thy own; thou art\naccountable for it to thy God.  Nay, I will not let thee go,\" he\ncontinued, as I again struggled; \"if thou struggle with me the whole day\nI will not let thee go, as Charles Wesley says, in his 'Wrestlings of\nJacob'; and see, it is of no use struggling, for I am, in the strength of\nmy Master, stronger than thou\"; and indeed, all of a sudden I had become\nvery weak and exhausted; whereupon the old man, beholding my situation,\ntook me by the arm and led me gently to a neighbouring town, which stood\nbehind a hill, and which I had not before observed; presently he opened\nthe door of a respectable-looking house, which stood beside a large\nbuilding having the appearance of a chapel, and conducted me into a small\nroom, with a great many books in it.  Having caused me to sit down, he\nstood looking at me for some time, occasionally heaving a sigh.  I was,\nindeed, haggard and forlorn.  \"Who art thou?\" he said at last.  \"A\nmiserable man,\" I replied.  \"What makes thee miserable?\" said the old\nman.  \"A hideous crime,\" I replied.  \"I can find no rest; like Cain I\nwander here and there.\"  The old man turned pale.  \"Hast thou taken\nanother's life?\" said he; \"if so, I advise thee to surrender thyself to\nthe magistrate; thou canst do no better; thy doing so will be the best\nproof of thy repentance; and though there be no hope for thee in this\nworld there may be much in the next.\"  \"No,\" said I, \"I have never taken\nanother's life.\"  \"What then, another's goods?  If so, restore them\nsevenfold, if possible: or, if it be not in thy power, and thy conscience\naccuse thee, surrender thyself to the magistrate, and make the only\nsatisfaction thou art able.\"  \"I have taken no one's goods,\" said I.  \"Of\nwhat art thou guilty, then?\" said he.  \"Art thou a drunkard? a\nprofligate?\"  \"Alas, no,\" said I; \"I am neither of these; would that I\nwere no worse.\"\n\n'Thereupon the old man looked steadfastly at me for some time; then,\nafter appearing to reflect, he said, \"Young man, I have a great desire to\nknow your name.\"  \"What matters it to you what is my name?\" said I; \"you\nknow nothing of me.\"  \"Perhaps you are mistaken,\" said the old man,\nlooking kindly at me; \"but at all events tell me your name.\"  I hesitated\na moment, and then told him who I was, whereupon he exclaimed with much\nemotion, \"I thought so; how wonderful are the ways of Providence.  I have\nheard of thee, young man, and know thy mother well.  Only a month ago,\nwhen upon a journey, I experienced much kindness from her.  She was\nspeaking to me of her lost child, with tears; she told me that you were\none of the best of sons, but that some strange idea appeared to have\noccupied your mind.  Despair not, my son.  If thou hast been afflicted, I\ndoubt not but that thy affliction will eventually turn out to thy\nbenefit; I doubt not but that thou wilt be preserved, as an example of\nthe great mercy of God.  I will now kneel down and pray for thee, my\nson.\"\n\n'He knelt down, and prayed long and fervently.  I remained standing for\nsome time; at length I knelt down likewise.  I scarcely knew what he was\nsaying, but when he concluded I said \"Amen.\"\n\n'And when we had risen from our knees, the old man left me for a short\ntime, and on his return led me into another room, where were two females;\none was an elderly person, the wife of the old man,--the other was a\nyoung woman of very prepossessing appearance (hang not down thy head,\nWinifred), who I soon found was a distant relation of the old man,--both\nreceived me with great kindness, the old man having doubtless previously\ntold them who I was.\n\n'I stayed several days in the good man's house.  I had still the greater\nportion of a small sum which I happened to have about me when I departed\non my dolorous wandering, and with this I purchased clothes, and altered\nmy appearance considerably.  On the evening of the second day my friend\nsaid, \"I am going to preach, perhaps you will come and hear me.\"  I\nconsented, and we all went, not to a church, but to the large building\nnext the house; for the old man, though a clergyman, was not of the\nestablished persuasion, and there the old man mounted a pulpit, and began\nto preach.  \"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,\" etc.\netc., was his text.  His sermon was long, but I still bear the greater\nportion of it in my mind.\n\n'The substance of it was that Jesus was at all times ready to take upon\nHimself the burden of our sins, provided we came to Him with a humble and\ncontrite spirit, and begged His help.  This doctrine was new to me; I had\noften been at church, but had never heard it preached before, at least so\ndistinctly.  When he said that all men might be saved, I shook, for I\nexpected he would add, all except those who had committed the mysterious\nsin; but no, all men were to be saved who with a humble and contrite\nspirit would come to Jesus, cast themselves at the foot of His cross, and\naccept pardon through the merits of His blood-shedding alone.  \"Therefore,\nmy friends,\" said he, in conclusion, \"despair not--however guilty you may\nbe, despair not--however desperate your condition may seem,\" said he,\nfixing his eyes upon me, \"despair not.  There is nothing more foolish and\nmore wicked than despair; over-weening confidence is not more foolish\nthan despair; both are the favourite weapons of the enemy of souls.\"\n\n'This discourse gave rise in my mind to no slight perplexity.  I had read\nin the Scriptures that he who committeth a certain sin shall never be\nforgiven, and that there is no hope for him either in this world or the\nnext.  And here was a man, a good man certainly, and one who, of\nnecessity, was thoroughly acquainted with the Scriptures, who told me\nthat any one might be forgiven, however wicked, who would only trust in\nChrist and in the merits of His blood-shedding.  Did I believe in Christ?\nAy, truly.  Was I willing to be saved by Christ?  Ay, truly.  Did I trust\nin Christ?  I trusted that Christ would save every one but myself.  And\nwhy not myself? simply because the Scriptures had told me that he who has\ncommitted the sin against the Holy Ghost can never be saved, and I had\ncommitted the sin against the Holy Ghost,--perhaps the only one who ever\nhad committed it.  How could I hope?  The Scriptures could not lie, and\nyet here was this good old man, profoundly versed in the Scriptures, who\nbade me hope; would he lie?  No.  But did the old man know my case?  Ah,\nno, he did not know my case! but yet he had bid me hope, whatever I had\ndone, provided I would go to Jesus.  But how could I think of going to\nJesus, when the Scriptures told me plainly that all would be useless?  I\nwas perplexed, and yet a ray of hope began to dawn in my soul.  I thought\nof consulting the good man, but I was afraid he would drive away the\nsmall glimmer.  I was afraid he would say, \"Oh yes, every one is to be\nsaved, except a wretch like you; I was not aware before that there was\nanything so horrible,--begone!\"  Once or twice the old man questioned me\non the subject of my misery, but I evaded him; once, indeed, when he\nlooked particularly benevolent, I think I should have unbosomed myself to\nhim, but we were interrupted.  He never pressed me much; perhaps he was\ndelicate in probing my mind, as we were then of different persuasions.\nHence he advised me to seek the advice of some powerful minister in my\nown church; there were many such in it, he said.\n\n'I stayed several days in the family, during which time I more than once\nheard my venerable friend preach; each time he preached, he exhorted his\nhearers not to despair.  The whole family were kind to me; his wife\nfrequently discoursed with me, and also the young person to whom I have\nalready alluded.  It appeared to me that the latter took a peculiar\ninterest in my fate.\n\n'At last my friend said to me, \"It is now time thou shouldest return to\nthy mother and thy brother.\"  So I arose, and departed to my mother and\nmy brother; and at my departure my old friend gave me his blessing, and\nhis wife and the young person shed tears, the last especially.  And when\nmy mother saw me, she shed tears, and fell on my neck and kissed me, and\nmy brother took me by the hand and bade me welcome; and when our first\nemotions were subsided, my mother said, \"I trust thou art come in a lucky\nhour.  A few weeks ago my cousin (whose favourite thou always wast) died\nand left thee his heir--left thee the goodly farm in which he lived.  I\ntrust, my son, that thou wilt now settle, and be a comfort to me in my\nold days.\"  And I answered, \"I will, if so please the Lord\"; and I said\nto myself, \"God grant that this bequest be a token of the Lord's favour.\"\n\n'And in a few days I departed to take possession of my farm; it was about\ntwenty miles from my mother's house, in a beautiful but rather wild\ndistrict; I arrived at the fall of the leaf.  All day long I busied\nmyself with my farm, and thus kept my mind employed.  At night, however,\nI felt rather solitary, and I frequently wished for a companion.  Each\nnight and morning I prayed fervently unto the Lord; for His hand had been\nvery heavy upon me, and I feared Him.\n\n'There was one thing connected with my new abode which gave me\nconsiderable uneasiness--the want of spiritual instruction.  There was a\nchurch, indeed, close at hand, in which service was occasionally\nperformed, but in so hurried and heartless a manner that I derived little\nbenefit from it.  The clergyman to whom the benefice belonged was a\nvaletudinarian, who passed his time in London, or at some watering-place,\nentrusting the care of his flock to the curate of a distant parish, who\ngave himself very little trouble about the matter.  Now I wanted every\nSunday to hear from the pulpit words of consolation and encouragement,\nsimilar to those which I had heard uttered from the pulpit by my good and\nvenerable friend, but I was debarred from this privilege.  At length, one\nday being in conversation with one of my labourers, a staid and serious\nman, I spoke to him of the matter which lay heavy upon my mind;\nwhereupon, looking me wistfully in the face, he said, \"Master, the want\nof religious instruction in my church was what drove me to the\nMethodists.\"  \"The Methodists,\" said I, \"are there any in these parts?\"\n\"There is a chapel,\" said he, \"only half a mile distant, at which there\nare two services every Sunday, and other two during the week.\"  Now it\nhappened that my venerable friend was of the Methodist persuasion, and\nwhen I heard the poor man talk in this manner, I said to him, \"May I go\nwith you next Sunday?\"  \"Why not?\" said he; so I went with the labourer\non the ensuing Sabbath to the meeting of the Methodists.\n\n'I liked the preaching which I heard at the chapel very well, though it\nwas not quite so comfortable as that of my old friend, the preacher being\nin some respects a different kind of man.  It, however, did me good, and\nI went again, and continued to do so, though I did not become a regular\nmember of the body at that time.\n\n'I had now the benefit of religious instruction, and also to a certain\nextent of religious fellowship, for the preacher and various members of\nhis flock frequently came to see me.  They were honest plain men, not\nexactly of the description which I wished for, but still good sort of\npeople, and I was glad to see them.  Once on a time, when some of them\nwere with me, one of them inquired whether I was fervent in prayer.  \"Very\nfervent,\" said I.  \"And do you read the Scriptures often?\" said he.  \"No,\"\nsaid I.  \"Why not?\" said he.  \"Because I am afraid to see there my own\ncondemnation.\"  They looked at each other, and said nothing at the time.\nOn leaving me, however, they all advised me to read the Scriptures with\nfervency and prayer.\n\n'As I had told these honest people, I shrank from searching the\nScriptures; the remembrance of the fatal passage was still too vivid in\nmy mind to permit me.  I did not wish to see my condemnation repeated,\nbut I was very fervent in prayer, and almost hoped that God would yet\nforgive me by virtue of the blood-shedding of the Lamb.  Time passed on,\nmy affairs prospered, and I enjoyed a certain portion of tranquillity.\nOccasionally, when I had nothing else to do, I renewed my studies.  Many\nis the book I read, especially in my native language, for I was always\nfond of my native language, and proud of being a Welshman.  Amongst the\nbooks I read were the odes of the great Ab Gwilym, whom thou, friend,\nhast never heard of; no, nor any of thy countrymen, for you are an\nignorant race, you Saxons, at least with respect to all that relates to\nWales and Welshmen.  I likewise read the book of Master Ellis Wyn.  The\nlatter work possessed a singular fascination for me, on account of its\nwonderful delineations of the torments of the nether world.\n\n'But man does not love to be alone; indeed, the Scripture says that it is\nnot good for man to be alone.  I occupied my body with the pursuits of\nhusbandry, and I improved my mind with the perusal of good and wise\nbooks; but, as I have already said, I frequently sighed for a companion\nwith whom I could exchange ideas, and who could take an interest in my\npursuits; the want of such a one I more particularly felt in the long\nwinter evenings.  It was then that the image of the young person whom I\nhad seen in the house of the preacher frequently rose up distinctly\nbefore my mind's eye, decked with quiet graces--hang not down your head,\nWinifred--and I thought that of all the women in the world I should wish\nher to be my partner, and then I considered whether it would be possible\nto obtain her.  I am ready to acknowledge, friend, that it was both\nselfish and wicked in me to wish to fetter any human being to a lost\ncreature like myself, conscious of having committed a crime for which the\nScriptures told me there is no pardon.  I had, indeed, a long struggle as\nto whether I should make the attempt or not--selfishness however\nprevailed.  I will not detain your attention with relating all that\noccurred at this period--suffice it to say that I made my suit and was\nsuccessful; it is true that the old man, who was her guardian, hesitated,\nand asked several questions respecting my state of mind.  I am afraid\nthat I partly deceived him, perhaps he partly deceived himself; he was\npleased that I had adopted his profession--we are all weak creatures.\nWith respect to the young person, she did not ask many questions; and I\nsoon found that I had won her heart.  To be brief, I married her; and\nhere she is, the truest wife that ever man had, and the kindest.  Kind I\nmay well call her, seeing that she shrinks not from me, who so cruelly\ndeceived her, in not telling her at first what I was.  I married her,\nfriend; and brought her home to my little possession, where we passed our\ntime very agreeably.  Our affairs prospered, our garners were full, and\nthere was coin in our purse.  I worked in the field; Winifred busied\nherself with the dairy.  At night I frequently read books to her, books\nof my own country, friend; I likewise read to her songs of my own, holy\nsongs and carols which she admired, and which yourself would perhaps\nadmire, could you understand them; but I repeat, you Saxons are an\nignorant people with respect to us, and a perverse, inasmuch as you\ndespise Welsh without understanding it.  Every night I prayed fervently,\nand my wife admired my gift of prayer.\n\n'One night, after I had been reading to my wife a portion of Ellis Wyn,\nmy wife said, \"This is a wonderful book, and containing much true and\npleasant doctrine; but how is it that you, who are so fond of good books,\nand good things in general, never read the Bible?  You read me the book\nof Master Ellis Wyn, you read me sweet songs of your own composition, you\nedify me with your gift of prayer, but yet you never read the Bible.\"  And\nwhen I heard her mention the Bible I shook, for I thought of my own\ncondemnation.  However, I dearly loved my wife, and as she pressed me, I\ncommenced on that very night reading the Bible.  All went on smoothly for\na long time; for months and months I did not find the fatal passage, so\nthat I almost thought that I had imagined it.  My affairs prospered much\nthe while, so that I was almost happy,--taking pleasure in everything\naround me,--in my wife, in my farm, my books and compositions, and the\nWelsh language; till one night, as I was reading the Bible, feeling\nparticularly comfortable, a thought having just come into my head that I\nwould print some of my compositions, and purchase a particular field of a\nneighbour--O God--God!  I came to the fatal passage.\n\n'Friend, friend, what shall I say?  I rushed out.  My wife followed me,\nasking me what was the matter.  I could only answer with groans--for\nthree days and three nights I did little else than groan.  Oh the\nkindness and solicitude of my wife!  \"What is the matter husband, dear\nhusband?\" she was continually saying.  I became at last more calm.  My\nwife still persisted in asking me the cause of my late paroxysm.  It is\nhard to keep a secret from a wife, especially such a wife as mine, so I\ntold my wife the tale, as we sat one night--it was a mid-winter\nnight--over the dying brands of our hearth, after the family had retired\nto rest, her hand locked in mine, even as it is now.\n\n'I thought she would have shrunk from me with horror; but she did not;\nher hand, it is true, trembled once or twice; but that was all.  At last\nshe gave mine a gentle pressure; and, looking up in my face, she\nsaid--what do you think my wife said, young man?'\n\n'It is impossible for me to guess,' said I.\n\n\"Let us go to rest, my love; your fears are all groundless.\"'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII\n\n\nGetting late--Seven years old--Chastening--Go forth--London Bridge--Same\neyes--Common occurrence--Very sleepy.\n\n'And so I still say,' said Winifred, sobbing.  'Let us retire to rest,\ndear husband; your fears are groundless.  I had hoped long since that\nyour affliction would have passed away, and I still hope that it\neventually will; so take heart, Peter, and let us retire to rest, for it\nis getting late.'\n\n'Rest!' said Peter; 'there is no rest for the wicked!'\n\n'We are all wicked,' said Winifred; 'but you are afraid of a shadow.  How\noften have I told you that the sin of your heart is not the sin against\nthe Holy Ghost: the sin of your heart is its natural pride, of which you\nare scarcely aware, to keep down which God in His mercy permitted you to\nbe terrified with the idea of having committed a sin which you never\ncommitted.'\n\n'Then you will still maintain,' said Peter, 'that I never committed the\nsin against the Holy Spirit?'\n\n'I will,' said Winifred; 'you never committed it.  How should a child\nseven years old commit a sin like that?'\n\n'Have I not read my own condemnation?' said Peter.  'Did not the first\nwords which I read in the Holy Scripture condemn me?  \"He who committeth\nthe sin against the Holy Ghost shall never enter into the kingdom of\nGod.\"'\n\n'You never committed it,' said Winifred.\n\n'But the words! the words! the words!' said Peter.\n\n'The words are true words,' said Winifred, sobbing; 'but they were not\nmeant for you, but for those who have broken their profession, who,\nhaving embraced the cross, have receded from their Master.'\n\n'And what sayst thou to the effect which the words produced upon me?'\nsaid Peter.  'Did they not cause me to run wild through Wales for years,\nlike Merddin Wyllt of yore; thinkest thou that I opened the book at that\nparticular passage by chance?'\n\n'No,' said Winifred, 'not by chance; it was the hand of God directed you,\ndoubtless for some wise purpose.  You had become satisfied with yourself.\nThe Lord wished to rouse thee from thy state of carnal security, and\ntherefore directed your eyes to that fearful passage.'\n\n'Does the Lord then carry out His designs by means of guile?' said Peter\nwith a groan.  'Is not the Lord true?  Would the Lord impress upon me\nthat I had committed a sin of which I am guiltless?  Hush, Winifred!\nhush! thou knowest that I have committed the sin.'\n\n'Thou hast not committed it,' said Winifred, sobbing yet more violently.\n'Were they my last words, I would persist that thou hast not committed\nit, though, perhaps, thou wouldst, but for this chastening; it was not to\nconvince thee that thou hast committed the sin, but rather to prevent\nthee from committing it, that the Lord brought that passage before thy\neyes.  He is not to blame, if thou art wilfully blind to the truth and\nwisdom of His ways.'\n\n'I see thou wouldst comfort me,' said Peter, 'as thou hast often before\nattempted to do.  I would fain ask the young man his opinion.'\n\n'I have not yet heard the whole of your history,' said I.\n\n'My story is nearly told,' said Peter; 'a few words will complete it.  My\nwife endeavoured to console and reassure me, using the arguments which\nyou have just heard her use, and many others, but in vain.  Peace nor\ncomfort came to my breast.  I was rapidly falling into the depths of\ndespair; when one day Winifred said to me, \"I see thou wilt be lost, if\nwe remain here.  One resource only remains.  Thou must go forth, my\nhusband, into the wide world, and to comfort thee I will go with thee.\"\n\"And what can I do in the wide world?\" said I, despondingly.  \"Much,\"\nreplied Winifred, \"if you will but exert yourself; much good canst thou\ndo with the blessing of God.\"  Many things of the same kind she said to\nme; and at last I arose from the earth to which God had smitten me, and\ndisposed of my property in the best way I could, and went into the world.\nWe did all the good we were able, visiting the sick, ministering to the\nsick, and praying with the sick.  At last I became celebrated as the\npossessor of a great gift of prayer.  And people urged me to preach, and\nWinifred urged me too, and at last I consented, and I preached.\nI--I--outcast Peter, became the preacher Peter Williams.  I, the lost\none, attempted to show others the right road.  And in this way I have\ngone on for thirteen years, preaching and teaching, visiting the sick,\nand ministering to them, with Winifred by my side heartening me on.\nOccasionally I am visited with fits of indescribable agony, generally on\nthe night before the Sabbath; for I then ask myself, how dare I, the\noutcast, attempt to preach the word of God?  Young man, my tale is told;\nyou seem in thought!'\n\n'I am thinking of London Bridge,' said I.\n\n'Of London Bridge!' said Peter and his wife.\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'of London Bridge.  I am indebted for much wisdom to\nLondon Bridge; it was there that I completed my studies.  But to the\npoint.  I was once reading on London Bridge a book which an ancient\ngentlewoman, who kept the bridge, was in the habit of lending me; and\nthere I found written, \"Each one carries in his breast the recollection\nof some sin which presses heavy upon him.  Oh, if men could but look into\neach other's hearts, what blackness would they find there!\"'\n\n'That's true,' said Peter.  'What is the name of the book?'\n\n'_The Life of Blessed Mary Flanders_.'\n\n'Some popish saint, I suppose,' said Peter.\n\n'As much of a saint, I daresay,' said I, 'as most popish ones; but you\ninterrupted me.  One part of your narrative brought the passage which I\nhave quoted into my mind.  You said that after you had committed this\nsame sin of yours you were in the habit, at school, of looking upon your\nschoolfellows with a kind of gloomy superiority, considering yourself a\nlone monstrous being who had committed a sin far above the daring of any\nof them.  Are you sure that many others of your schoolfellows were not\nlooking upon you and the others with much the same eyes with which you\nwere looking upon them?'\n\n'How!' said Peter, 'dost thou think that they had divined my secret?'\n\n'Not they,' said I, 'they were, I daresay, thinking too much of\nthemselves and of their own concerns to have divined any secrets of\nyours.  All I mean to say is, they had probably secrets of their own, and\nwho knows that the secret sin of more than one of them was not the very\nsin which caused you so much misery?'\n\n'Dost thou then imagine,' said Peter, 'the sin against the Holy Ghost to\nbe so common an occurrence?'\n\n'As you have described it,' said I, 'of very common occurrence,\nespecially amongst children, who are, indeed, the only beings likely to\ncommit it.'\n\n'Truly,' said Winifred, 'the young man talks wisely.'\n\nPeter was silent for some moments, and appeared to be reflecting; at\nlast, suddenly raising his head, he looked me full in the face, and,\ngrasping my hand with vehemence, he said, 'Tell me, young man, only one\nthing, hast thou, too, committed the sin against the Holy Ghost?'\n\n'I am neither Papist nor Methodist,' said I, 'but of the Church, and,\nbeing so, confess myself to no one, but keep my own counsel; I will tell\nthee, however, had I committed, at the same age, twenty such sins as that\nwhich you committed, I should feel no uneasiness at these years--but I am\nsleepy, and must go to rest.'\n\n'God bless thee, young man,' said Winifred.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVIII\n\n\nLow and calm--Much better--Blessed effect--No answer--Such a sermon.\n\nBefore I sank to rest I heard Winifred and her husband conversing in the\nplace where I had left them; both their voices were low and calm.  I soon\nfell asleep, and slumbered for some time.  On my awakening I again heard\nthem conversing, but they were now in their cart; still the voices of\nboth were calm.  I heard no passionate bursts of wild despair on the part\nof the man.  Methought I occasionally heard the word Pechod proceeding\nfrom the lips of each, but with no particular emphasis.  I supposed they\nwere talking of the innate sin of both their hearts.\n\n'I wish that man were happy,' said I to myself, 'were it only for his\nwife's sake, and yet he deserves to be happy for his own.'\n\nThe next day Peter was very cheerful, more cheerful than I had ever seen\nhim.  At breakfast his conversation was animated, and he smiled\nrepeatedly.  I looked at him with the greatest interest, and the eyes of\nhis wife were almost constantly fixed upon him.  A shade of gloom would\noccasionally come over his countenance, but it almost instantly\ndisappeared; perhaps it proceeded more from habit than anything else.\nAfter breakfast he took his Welsh Bible and sat down beneath a tree.  His\neyes were soon fixed intently on the volume; now and then he would call\nhis wife, show her some passage, and appeared to consult with her.  The\nday passed quickly and comfortably.\n\n'Your husband seems much better,' said I, at evening fall, to Winifred,\nas we chanced to be alone.\n\n'He does,' said Winifred; 'and that on the day of the week when he was\nwont to appear most melancholy, for to-morrow is the Sabbath.  He now no\nlonger looks forward to the Sabbath with dread, but appears to reckon on\nit.  What a happy change! and to think that this change should have been\nproduced by a few words, seemingly careless ones, proceeding from the\nmouth of one who is almost a stranger to him.  Truly, it is wonderful.'\n\n'To whom do you allude,' said I; 'and to what words?'\n\n'To yourself, and to the words which came from your lips last night,\nafter you had heard my poor husband's history.  Those strange words,\ndrawn out with so much seeming indifference, have produced in my husband\nthe blessed effect which you have observed.  They have altered the\ncurrent of his ideas.  He no longer thinks himself the only being in the\nworld doomed to destruction,--the only being capable of committing the\nnever-to-be-forgiven sin.  Your supposition that that which harrowed his\nsoul is of frequent occurrence amongst children has tranquillised him;\nthe mist which hung over his mind has cleared away, and he begins to see\nthe groundlessness of his apprehensions.  The Lord has permitted him to\nbe chastened for a season, but his lamp will only burn the brighter for\nwhat he has undergone.'\n\nSunday came, fine and glorious as the last.  Again my friends and myself\nbreakfasted together--again the good family of the house on the hill\nabove, headed by the respectable master, descended to the meadow.  Peter\nand his wife were ready to receive them.  Again Peter placed himself at\nthe side of the honest farmer, and Winifred by the side of her friend.\n'Wilt thou not come?' said Peter, looking towards me with a face in which\nthere was much emotion.  'Wilt thou not come?' said Winifred, with a face\nbeaming with kindness.  But I made no answer, and presently the party\nmoved away, in the same manner in which it had moved on the preceding\nSabbath, and I was again left alone.\n\nThe hours of the Sabbath passed slowly away.  I sat gazing at the sky,\nthe trees, and the water.  At last I strolled up to the house and sat\ndown in the porch.  It was empty; there was no modest maiden there, as on\nthe preceding Sabbath.  The damsel of the book had accompanied the rest.\nI had seen her in the procession, and the house appeared quite deserted.\nThe owners had probably left it to my custody, so I sat down in the\nporch, quite alone.  The hours of the Sabbath passed heavily away.\n\nAt last evening came, and with it the party of the morning.  I was now at\nmy place beneath the oak.  I went forward to meet them.  Peter and his\nwife received me with a calm and quiet greeting, and passed forward.  The\nrest of the party had broken into groups.  There was a kind of excitement\namongst them, and much eager whispering.  I went to one of the groups;\nthe young girl of whom I have spoken more than once was speaking: 'Such a\nsermon,' said she, 'it has never been our lot to hear; Peter never before\nspoke as he has done this day--he was always a powerful preacher, but oh,\nthe unction of the discourse of this morning, and yet more of that of the\nafternoon, which was the continuation of it!'  'What was the subject?'\nsaid I, interrupting her.  'Ah! you should have been there, young man, to\nhave heard it; it would have made a lasting impression upon you.  I was\nbathed in tears all the time; those who heard it will never forget the\npreaching of the good Peter Williams on the Power, Providence, and\nGoodness of God.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIX\n\n\nDeep interest--Goodly country--Two mansions--Welshman's Candle--Beautiful\nuniverse--Godly discourse--Fine church--Points of doctrine--Strange\nadventures--Paltry cause--Roman pontiff--Evil spirit.\n\nOn the morrow I said to my friends, 'I am about to depart; farewell!'\n'Depart!' said Peter and his wife, simultaneously; 'whither wouldst thou\ngo?'  'I can't stay here all my days,' I replied.  'Of course not,' said\nPeter; 'but we had no idea of losing thee so soon: we had almost hoped\nthat thou wouldst join us, become one of us.  We are under infinite\nobligations to thee.'  'You mean I am under infinite obligations to you,'\nsaid I.  'Did you not save my life?'  'Perhaps so, under God,' said\nPeter; 'and what hast thou not done for me?  Art thou aware that, under\nGod, thou hast preserved my soul from despair?  But, independent of that,\nwe like thy company, and feel a deep interest in thee, and would fain\nteach thee the way that is right.  Hearken, to-morrow we go into Wales;\ngo with us.'  'I have no wish to go into Wales,' said I.  'Why not?' said\nPeter, with animation.  'Wales is a goodly country; as the Scripture\nsays--a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths, that spring out\nof valleys and hills, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose\nhills thou mayest dig lead.'\n\n'I daresay it is a very fine country,' said I, 'but I have no wish to go\nthere just now; my destiny seems to point in another direction, to say\nnothing of my trade.'  'Thou dost right to say nothing of thy trade,'\nsaid Peter, smiling, 'for thou seemest to care nothing about it; which\nhas led Winifred and myself to suspect that thou art not altogether what\nthou seemest; but, setting that aside, we should be most happy if thou\nwouldst go with us into Wales.'  'I cannot promise to go with you into\nWales,' said I; 'but, as you depart to-morrow, I will stay with you\nthrough the day, and on the morrow accompany you part of the way.'  'Do,'\nsaid Peter: 'I have many people to see to-day, and so has Winifred; but\nwe will both endeavour to have some serious discourse with thee, which,\nperhaps, will turn to thy profit in the end.'\n\nIn the course of the day the good Peter came to me, as I was seated\nbeneath the oak, and, placing himself by me, commenced addressing me in\nthe following manner:--\n\n'I have no doubt, my young friend, that you are willing to admit that the\nmost important thing which a human being possesses is his soul; it is of\ninfinitely more importance than the body, which is a frail substance, and\ncannot last for many years; but not so the soul, which, by its nature, is\nimperishable.  To one of two mansions the soul is destined to depart,\nafter its separation from the body, to heaven or hell; to the halls of\neternal bliss, where God and His holy angels dwell, or to the place of\nendless misery, inhabited by Satan and his grisly companions.  My friend,\nif the joys of heaven are great, unutterably great, so are the torments\nof hell unutterably so.  I wish not to speak of them, I wish not to\nterrify your imagination with the torments of hell: indeed, I like not to\nthink of them; but it is necessary to speak of them sometimes, and to\nthink of them sometimes, lest you should sink into a state of carnal\nsecurity.  Authors, friend, and learned men, are not altogether agreed as\nto the particulars of hell.  They all agree, however, in considering it a\nplace of exceeding horror.  Master Ellis Wyn, who by the bye was a\nchurchman, calls it, amongst other things, a place of strong sighs, and\nof flaming sparks.  Master Rees Pritchard, who was not only a churchman,\nbut Vicar of Llandovery, and flourished about two hundred years ago--I\nwish many like him flourished now--speaking of hell, in his collection of\nsweet hymns called the \"Welshman's Candle,\" observes,\n\n'\"The pool is continually blazing; it is very deep, without any known\nbottom, and the walls are so high, that there is neither hope nor\npossibility of escaping over them.\"\n\n'But, as I told you just now, I have no great pleasure in talking of\nhell.  No, friend, no; I would sooner talk of the other place, and of the\ngoodness and hospitality of God amongst His saints above.'\n\nAnd then the excellent man began to dilate upon the joys of heaven, and\nthe goodness and hospitality of God in the mansions above; explaining to\nme, in the clearest way, how I might get there.\n\nAnd when he had finished what he had to say, he left me, whereupon\nWinifred drew nigh, and sitting down by me began to address me.  'I do\nnot think,' said she, 'from what I have observed of thee, that thou\nwouldst wish to be ungrateful, and yet, is not thy whole life a series of\ningratitude, and to whom?--to thy Maker.  Has He not endowed thee with a\ngoodly and healthy form; and senses which enable thee to enjoy the\ndelights of His beautiful universe--the work of His hands?  Canst thou\nnot enjoy, even to rapture, the brightness of the sun, the perfume of the\nmeads, and the song of the dear birds which inhabit among the trees?  Yes,\nthou canst; for I have seen thee, and observed thee doing so.  Yet,\nduring the whole time that I have known thee, I have not heard proceed\nfrom thy lips one single word of praise or thanksgiving to . . .'\n\nAnd in this manner the admirable woman proceeded for a considerable time,\nand to all her discourse I listened with attention; and when she had\nconcluded, I took her hand and said, 'I thank you,' and that was all.\n\nOn the next day everything was ready for our departure.  The good family\nof the house came to bid us farewell.  There were shaking of hands, and\nkisses, as on the night of our arrival.\n\nAnd as I stood somewhat apart, the young girl of whom I have spoken so\noften came up to me, and holding out her hand, said, 'Farewell, young\nman, wherever thou goest.'  Then, after looking around her, she said, 'It\nwas all true you told me.  Yesterday I received a letter from him thou\nwottest of; he is coming soon.  God bless you, young man; who would have\nthought thou knewest so much!'\n\nSo, after we had taken our farewell of the good family, we departed,\nproceeding in the direction of Wales.  Peter was very cheerful, and\nenlivened the way with godly discourse and spiritual hymns, some of which\nwere in the Welsh language.  At length I said, 'It is a pity that you did\nnot continue in the Church; you have a turn for Psalmody, and I have\nheard of a man becoming a bishop by means of a less qualification.'\n\n'Very probably,' said Peter; 'more the pity.  But I have told you the\nreason of my forsaking it.  Frequently, when I went to the church door, I\nfound it barred, and the priest absent; what was I to do?  My heart was\nbursting for want of some religious help and comfort; what could I do? as\ngood Master Rees Pritchard observes in his \"Candle for Welshmen\":--\n\n'\"It is a doleful thing to see little children burning on the hot coals\nfor want of help; but yet more doleful to see a flock of souls falling\ninto the burning lake for want of a priest.\"'\n\n'The Church of England is a fine church,' said I; 'I would not advise any\none to speak ill of the Church of England before me.'\n\n'I have nothing to say against the church,' said Peter; 'all I wish is\nthat it would fling itself a little more open, and that its priests would\na little more bestir themselves; in a word, that it would shoulder the\ncross and become a missionary church.'\n\n'It is too proud for that,' said Winifred.\n\n'You are much more of a Methodist,' said I, 'than your husband.  But tell\nme,' said I, addressing myself to Peter, 'do you not differ from the\nchurch in some points of doctrine?  I, of course, as a true member of the\nchurch, am quite ignorant of the peculiar opinions of wandering\nsectaries.'\n\n'Oh the pride of that church!' said Winifred, half to herself; 'wandering\nsectaries!'\n\n'We differ in no points of doctrine,' said Peter; 'we believe all the\nchurch believes, though we are not so fond of vain and superfluous\nceremonies, snow-white neckcloths and surplices, as the church is.  We\nlikewise think that there is no harm in a sermon by the road-side, or in\nholding free discourse with a beggar beneath a hedge, or a tinker,' he\nadded, smiling; 'it was those superfluous ceremonies, those surplices and\nwhite neckcloths, and, above all, the necessity of strictly regulating\nhis words and conversation, which drove John Wesley out of the church,\nand sent him wandering up and down as you see me, poor Welsh Peter, do.'\n\nNothing farther passed for some time; we were now drawing near the hills:\nat last I said, 'You must have met with a great many strange adventures\nsince you took up this course of life?'\n\n'Many,' said Peter, 'it has been my lot to meet with; but none more\nstrange than one which occurred to me only a few weeks ago.  You were\nasking me, not long since, whether I believed in devils?  Ay, truly,\nyoung man; and I believe that the abyss and the yet deeper unknown do not\ncontain them all; some walk about upon the green earth.  So it happened,\nsome weeks ago, that I was exercising my ministry about forty miles from\nhere.  I was alone, Winifred being slightly indisposed, staying for a few\ndays at the house of an acquaintance; I had finished afternoon's\nworship--the people had dispersed, and I was sitting solitary by my cart\nunder some green trees in a quiet retired place; suddenly a voice said to\nme, \"Good-evening, Pastor\"; I looked up, and before me stood a man, at\nleast the appearance of a man, dressed in a black suit of rather a\nsingular fashion.  He was about my own age, or somewhat older.  As I\nlooked upon him, it appeared to me that I had seen him twice before\nwhilst preaching.  I replied to his salutation, and perceiving that he\nlooked somewhat fatigued, I took out a stool from the cart, and asked him\nto sit down.  We began to discourse; I at first supposed that he might be\none of ourselves, some wandering minister; but I was soon undeceived.\nNeither his language nor his ideas were those of any one of our body.  He\nspoke on all kinds of matters with much fluency; till at last he\nmentioned my preaching, complimenting me on my powers.  I replied, as\nwell I might, that I could claim no merit of my own, and that if I spoke\nwith any effect, it was only by the grace of God.  As I uttered these\nlast words, a horrible kind of sneer came over his countenance, which\nmade me shudder, for there was something diabolical in it.  I said little\nmore, but listened attentively to his discourse.  At last he said that I\nwas engaged in a paltry cause, quite unworthy of one of my powers.  \"How\ncan that be,\" said I, \"even if I possessed all the powers in the world,\nseeing that I am engaged in the cause of our Lord Jesus?\"\n\n'The same kind of sneer again came on his countenance, but he almost\ninstantly observed, that if I chose to forsake this same miserable cause,\nfrom which nothing but contempt and privation was to be expected, he\nwould enlist me into another, from which I might expect both profit and\nrenown.  An idea now came into my head, and I told him firmly that if he\nwished me to forsake my present profession and become a member of the\nChurch of England, I must absolutely decline; that I had no ill-will\nagainst that church, but I thought I could do most good in my present\nposition, which I would not forsake to be Archbishop of Canterbury.\nThereupon he burst into a strange laughter, and went away, repeating to\nhimself, \"Church of England!  Archbishop of Canterbury!\"  A few days\nafter, when I was once more in a solitary place, he again appeared before\nme, and asked me whether I had thought over his words, and whether I was\nwilling to enlist under the banners of his master, adding that he was\neager to secure me, as he conceived that I might be highly useful to the\ncause.  I then asked him who his master was; he hesitated for a moment,\nand then answered, \"The Roman Pontiff.\"  \"If it be he,\" said I, \"I can\nhave nothing to do with him; I will serve no one who is an enemy of\nChrist.\"  Thereupon he drew near to me, and told me not to talk so much\nlike a simpleton; that as for Christ, it was probable that no such person\never existed, but that if He ever did, He was the greatest impostor the\nworld ever saw.  How long he continued in this way I know not, for I now\nconsidered that an evil spirit was before me, and shrank within myself,\nshivering in every limb; when I recovered myself and looked about me, he\nwas gone.  Two days after, he again stood before me, in the same place,\nand about the same hour, renewing his propositions, and speaking more\nhorribly than before.  I made him no answer; whereupon he continued; but\nsuddenly hearing a noise behind him, he looked round and beheld Winifred,\nwho had returned to me on the morning of that day.  \"Who are you?\" said\nhe, fiercely.  \"This man's wife,\" said she, calmly fixing her eyes upon\nhim.  \"Begone from him, unhappy one, thou temptest him in vain.\"  He made\nno answer, but stood as if transfixed: at length, recovering himself, he\ndeparted, muttering \"Wife! wife!  If the fool has a wife, he will never\ndo for us.\"'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXX\n\n\nThe border--Thank you both--Pipe and fiddle--Taliesin.\n\nWe were now drawing very near the hills, and Peter said, 'If you are to\ngo into Wales, you must presently decide, for we are close upon the\nborder.'\n\n'Which is the border?' said I.\n\n'Yon small brook,' said Peter, 'into which the man on horseback who is\ncoming towards us is now entering.'\n\n'I see it,' said I, 'and the man; he stops in the middle of it, as if to\nwater his steed.'\n\nWe proceeded till we had nearly reached the brook.  'Well,' said Peter,\n'will you go into Wales?'\n\n'What should I do in Wales?' I demanded.\n\n'Do!' said Peter, smiling, 'learn Welsh.'\n\nI stopped my little pony.  'Then I need not go into Wales; I already know\nWelsh.'\n\n'Know Welsh!' said Peter, staring at me.\n\n'Know Welsh!' said Winifred, stopping her cart.\n\n'How and when did you learn it?' said Peter.\n\n'From books, in my boyhood.'\n\n'Read Welsh!' said Peter; 'is it possible?'\n\n'Read Welsh!' said Winifred; 'is it possible?'\n\n'Well, I hope you will come with us,' said Peter.\n\n'Come with us, young man,' said Winifred; 'let me, on the other side of\nthe brook, welcome you into Wales.'\n\n'Thank you both,' said I, 'but I will not come.'\n\n'Wherefore?' exclaimed both, simultaneously.\n\n'Because it is neither fit nor proper that I cross into Wales at this\ntime, and in this manner.  When I go into Wales, I should wish to go in a\nnew suit of superfine black, with hat and beaver, mounted on a powerful\nsteed, black and glossy, like that which bore Greduv to the fight of\nCatraeth.  I should wish, moreover, to see the Welshmen assembled on the\nborder ready to welcome me with pipe and fiddle, and much whooping and\nshouting, and to attend me to Wrexham, or even as far as Machynllaith,\nwhere I should wish to be invited to a dinner at which all the bards\nshould be present, and to be seated at the right hand of the president,\nwho, when the cloth was removed, should arise, and, amidst cries of\nsilence, exclaim--\"Brethren and Welshmen, allow me to propose the health\nof my most respectable friend the translator of the odes of the great Ab\nGwilym, the pride and glory of Wales.\"'\n\n'How!' said Peter, 'hast thou translated the works of the mighty Dafydd?'\n\n'With notes critical, historical, and explanatory.'\n\n'Come with us, friend,' said Peter.  'I cannot promise such a dinner as\nthou wishest, but neither pipe nor fiddle shall be wanting.'\n\n'Come with us, young man,' said Winifred, 'even as thou art, and the\ndaughters of Wales shall bid thee welcome.'\n\n'I will not go with you,' said I.  'Dost thou see that man in the ford?'\n\n'Who is staring at us so, and whose horse has not yet done drinking?  Of\ncourse I see him.'\n\n'I shall turn back with him.  God bless you.'\n\n'Go back with him not,' said Peter; 'he is one of those whom I like not,\none of the clibberty-clabber, as Master Ellis Wyn observes--turn not with\nthat man.'\n\n'Go not back with him,' said Winifred.  'If thou goest with that man,\nthou wilt soon forget all our profitable counsels; come with us.'\n\n'I cannot; I have much to say to him.  Kosko Divvus, Mr. Petulengro.'\n\n'Kosko Divvus, Pal,' said Mr. Petulengro, riding through the water; 'are\nyou turning back?'\n\nI turned back with Mr. Petulengro.\n\nPeter came running after me: 'One moment, young man,--who and what are\nyou?'\n\n'I must answer in the words of Taliesin,' said I: 'none can say with\npositiveness whether I be fish or flesh, least of all myself.  God bless\nyou both!'\n\n'Take this,' said Peter, and he thrust his Welsh Bible into my hand.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXI\n\n\nAt a funeral--Two days ago--Very coolly--Roman woman--Well and\nhearty--Somewhat dreary--Plum pudding--Roman fashion--Quite different--The\ndark lane--Beyond the time--Fine fellow--Such a struggle--Like a wild\ncat--Fair Play--Pleasant enough spot--No gloves.\n\nSo I turned back with Mr. Petulengro.  We travelled for some time in\nsilence; at last we fell into discourse.  'You have been in Wales, Mr.\nPetulengro?'\n\n'Ay, truly, brother.'\n\n'What have you been doing there?'\n\n'Assisting at a funeral.'\n\n'At whose funeral?'\n\n'Mrs. Herne's, brother.'\n\n'Is she dead, then?'\n\n'As a nail, brother.'\n\n'How did she die?'\n\n'By hanging, brother.'\n\n'I am lost in astonishment,' said I; whereupon Mr. Petulengro, lifting\nhis sinister leg over the neck of his steed, and adjusting himself\nsideways in the saddle, replied, with great deliberation, 'Two days ago I\nhappened to be at a fair not very far from here; I was all alone by\nmyself, for our party were upwards of forty miles off, when who should\ncome up but a chap that I knew, a relation, or rather a connection, of\nmine--one of those Hernes.  \"Aren't you going to the funeral?\" said he;\nand then, brother, there passed between him and me, in the way of\nquestioning and answering, much the same as has just now passed between\nme and you; but when he mentioned hanging, I thought I could do no less\nthan ask who hanged her, which you forgot to do.  \"Who hanged her?\" said\nI; and then the man told me that she had done it herself; been her own\nhinjiri; and then I thought to myself what a sin and shame it would be if\nI did not go to the funeral, seeing that she was my own mother-in-law.  I\nwould have brought my wife, and, indeed, the whole of our party, but\nthere was no time for that; they were too far off, and the dead was to be\nburied early the next morning; so I went with the man, and he led me into\nWales, where his party had lately retired, and when there, through many\nwild and desolate places to their encampment, and there I found the\nHernes, and the dead body--the last laid out on a mattress, in a tent,\ndressed Romaneskoenaes in a red cloak, and big bonnet of black beaver.  I\nmust say for the Hernes that they took the matter very coolly; some were\neating, others drinking, and some were talking about their small affairs;\nthere was one, however, who did not take the matter so coolly, but took\non enough for the whole family, sitting beside the dead woman, tearing\nher hair, and refusing to take either meat or drink; it was the child\nLeonora.  I arrived at night-fall, and the burying was not to take place\ntill the morning, which I was rather sorry for, as I am not very fond of\nthem Hernes, who are not very fond of anybody.  They never asked me to\neat or drink, notwithstanding I had married into the family; one of them,\nhowever, came up and offered to fight me for five shillings; had it not\nbeen for them I should have come back as empty as I went--he didn't stand\nup five minutes.  Brother, I passed the night as well as I could, beneath\na tree, for the tents were full, and not over clean; I slept little, and\nhad my eyes about me, for I knew the kind of people I was among.\n\n'Early in the morning the funeral took place.  The body was placed not in\na coffin but on a bier, and carried not to a churchyard but to a deep\ndell close by; and there it was buried beneath a rock, dressed just as I\nhave told you; and this was done by the bidding of Leonora, who had heard\nher bebee say that she wished to be buried, not in gorgious fashion, but\nlike a Roman woman of the old blood, the kosko puro rati, brother.  When\nit was over, and we had got back to the encampment, I prepared to be\ngoing.  Before mounting my gry, however, I bethought me to ask what could\nhave induced the dead woman to make away with herself--a thing so\nuncommon amongst Romanies; whereupon one squinted with his eyes, a second\nspirted saliver into the air, and a third said that he neither knew nor\ncared; she was a good riddance, having more than once been nearly the\nruin of them all, from the quantity of brimstone she carried about her.\nOne, however, I suppose rather ashamed of the way in which they had\ntreated me, said at last that if I wanted to know all about the matter\nnone could tell me better than the child, who was in all her secrets, and\nwas not a little like her; so I looked about for the child, but could\nfind her nowhere.  At last the same man told me that he shouldn't wonder\nif I found her at the grave; so I went back to the grave, and sure enough\nthere I found the child Leonora, seated on the ground above the body,\ncrying and taking on; so I spoke kindly to her, and said, \"How came all\nthis, Leonora? tell me all about it.\"  It was a long time before I could\nget any answer; at last she opened her mouth and spoke, and these were\nthe words she said, \"It was all along of your Pal\"; and then she told me\nall about the matter--how Mrs. Herne could not abide you, which I knew\nbefore; and that she had sworn your destruction, which I did not know\nbefore.  And then she told me how she found you living in the wood by\nyourself, and how you were enticed to eat a poisoned cake; and she told\nme many other things that you wot of, and she told me what perhaps you\ndon't wot, namely, that finding you had been removed, she, the child, had\ntracked you a long way, and found you at last well and hearty, and no\nways affected by the poison, and heard you, as she stood concealed,\ndisputing about religion with a Welsh Methody.  Well, brother, she told\nme all this; and, moreover, that when Mrs. Herne heard of it, she said\nthat a dream of hers had come to pass.  I don't know what it was, but\nsomething about herself, a tinker, and a dean; and then she added that it\nwas all up with her, and that she must take a long journey.  Well,\nbrother, that same night Leonora, waking from her sleep in the tent where\nMrs. Herne and she were wont to sleep, missed her bebee, and, becoming\nalarmed, went in search of her, and at last found her hanging from a\nbranch; and when the child had got so far, she took on violently, and I\ncould not get another word from her; so I left her, and here I am.'\n\n{picture:'Sure enough there I found the child Leonora, seated on the\nground above the body, crying and taking on.': page454.jpg}\n\n'And I am glad to see you, Mr. Petulengro; but this is sad news which you\ntell me about Mrs. Herne.'\n\n{picture:'Leonora, waking from her sleep, missed her bebee, and, becoming\nalarmed, went in search of her, and at last found her hanging from a\nbranch.': page456.jpg}\n\n'Somewhat dreary, brother; yet, perhaps, after all, it is a good thing\nthat she is removed; she carried so much Devil's tinder about with her,\nas the man said.'\n\n'I am sorry for her,' said I; 'more especially as I am the cause of her\ndeath--though the innocent one.'\n\n'She could not bide you, brother, that's certain; but that is no\nreason'--said Mr. Petulengro, balancing himself upon the saddle--'that is\nno reason why she should prepare drow to take away your essence of life;\nand, when disappointed, to hang herself upon a tree: if she was\ndissatisfied with you, she might have flown at you, and scratched your\nface; or, if she did not judge herself your match, she might have put\ndown five shillings for a turn-up between you and some one she thought\ncould beat you--myself, for example--and so the matter might have ended\ncomfortably; but she was always too fond of covert ways, drows, and\nbrimstones.  This is not the first poisoning affair she has been engaged\nin.'\n\n'You allude to drabbing bawlor.'\n\n'Bah!' said Mr. Petulengro; 'there's no harm in that.  No, no! she has\ncast drows in her time for other guess things than bawlor; both Gorgios\nand Romans have tasted of them, and died.  Did you never hear of the\npoisoned plum pudding?'\n\n'Never.'\n\n'Then I will tell you about it.  It happened about six years ago, a few\nmonths after she had quitted us--she had gone first amongst her own\npeople, as she called them; but there was another small party of Romans,\nwith whom she soon became very intimate.  It so happened that this small\nparty got into trouble; whether it was about a horse or an ass, or\npassing bad money, no matter to you and me, who had no hand in the\nbusiness; three or four of them were taken and lodged in--Castle, and\namongst them was a woman; but the sherengro, or principal man of the\nparty, and who it seems had most hand in the affair, was still at large.\nAll of a sudden a rumour was spread abroad that the woman was about to\nplay false, and to 'peach the rest.  Said the principal man, when he\nheard it, \"If she does, I am nashkado.\"  Mrs. Herne was then on a visit\nto the party, and when she heard the principal man take on so, she said,\n\"But I suppose you know what to do?\"  \"I do not,\" said he.  \"Then hir mi\ndevlis,\" said she, \"you are a fool.  But leave the matter to me, I know\nhow to dispose of her in Roman fashion.\"  Why she wanted to interfere in\nthe matter, brother, I don't know, unless it was from pure brimstoneness\nof disposition--she had no hand in the matter which had brought the party\ninto trouble--she was only on a visit, and it had happened before she\ncame; but she was always ready to give dangerous advice.  Well, brother,\nthe principal man listened to what she had to say, and let her do what\nshe would; and she made a pudding, a very nice one, no doubt--for,\nbesides plums, she put in drows and all the Roman condiments that she\nknew of; and she gave it to the principal man, and the principal put it\ninto a basket and directed it to the woman in--Castle, and the woman in\nthe castle took it and--'\n\n'Ate of it,' said I; 'just like my case!'\n\n'Quite different, brother; she took it, it is true, but instead of giving\nway to her appetite, as you might have done, she put it before the rest\nwhom she was going to impeach; perhaps she wished to see how they liked\nit before she tasted it herself; and all the rest were poisoned, and one\ndied, and there was a precious outcry, and the woman cried loudest of\nall; and she said, \"It was my death was sought for; I know the man, and\nI'll be revenged.\"  And then the Poknees spoke to her and said, \"Where\ncan we find him?\" and she said, \"I am awake to his motions; three weeks\nfrom hence, the night before the full moon, at such and such an hour, he\nwill pass down such a lane with such a man.\"'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'and what did the Poknees do?'\n\n'Do, brother! sent for a plastramengro from Bow Street, quite secretly,\nand told him what the woman had said; and the night before the full moon,\nthe plastramengro went to the place which the juwa had pointed out, all\nalone, brother; and in order that he might not be too late, he went two\nhours before his time.  I know the place well, brother, where the\nplastramengro placed himself behind a thick holly tree, at the end of a\nlane, where a gate leads into various fields, through which there is a\npath for carts and horses.  The lane is called the dark lane by the\nGorgios, being much shaded by trees.  So the plastramengro placed himself\nin the dark lane behind the holly tree; it was a cold February night,\ndreary though; the wind blew in gusts, and the moon had not yet risen,\nand the plastramengro waited behind the tree till he was tired, and\nthought he might as well sit down; so he sat down, and was not long in\nfalling to sleep, and there he slept for some hours; and when he awoke\nthe moon had risen, and was shining bright, so that there was a kind of\nmoonlight even in the dark lane; and the plastramengro pulled out his\nwatch, and contrived to make out that it was just two hours beyond the\ntime when the men should have passed by.  Brother, I do not know what the\nplastramengro thought of himself, but I know, brother, what I should have\nthought of myself in his situation.  I should have thought, brother, that\nI was a drowsy scoppelo, and that I had let the fellow pass by whilst I\nwas sleeping behind a bush.  As it turned out, however, his going to\nsleep did no harm, but quite the contrary: just as he was going away, he\nheard a gate slam in the direction of the fields, and then he heard the\nlow stumping of horses, as if on soft ground, for the path in those\nfields is generally soft, and at that time it had been lately ploughed\nup.  Well, brother, presently he saw two men on horseback coming towards\nthe lane through the field behind the gate; the man who rode foremost was\na tall big fellow, the very man he was in quest of; the other was a\nsmaller chap, not so small either, but a light, wiry fellow, and a proper\nmaster of his hands when he sees occasion for using them.  Well, brother,\nthe foremost man came to the gate, reached at the hank, undid it, and\nrode through, holding it open for the other.  Before, however, the other\ncould follow into the lane, out bolted the plastramengro from behind the\ntree, kicked the gate to with his foot, and, seizing the big man on horse-\nback, \"You are my prisoner,\" said he.  I am of opinion, brother, that the\nplastramengro, notwithstanding he went to sleep, must have been a regular\nfine fellow.'\n\n'I am entirely of your opinion,' said I; 'but what happened then?'\n\n'Why, brother, the Rommany chal, after he had somewhat recovered from his\nsurprise, for it is rather uncomfortable to be laid hold of at\nnight-time, and told you are a prisoner; more especially when you happen\nto have two or three things on your mind which, if proved against you,\nwould carry you to the nashky,--the Rommany chal, I say, clubbed his\nwhip, and aimed a blow at the plastramengro, which, if it had hit him on\nthe skull, as was intended, would very likely have cracked it.  The\nplastramengro, however, received it partly on his staff, so that it did\nhim no particular damage.  Whereupon, seeing what kind of customer he had\nto deal with, he dropped his staff and seized the chal with both his\nhands, who forthwith spurred his horse, hoping, by doing so, either to\nbreak away from him or fling him down; but it would not do--the\nplastramengro held on like a bull-dog, so that the Rommany chal, to\nescape being hauled to the ground, suddenly flung himself off the saddle,\nand then happened in that lane, close by the gate, such a struggle\nbetween those two--the chal and the runner--as I suppose will never\nhappen again.  But you must have heard of it; every one has heard of it;\nevery one has heard of the fight between the Bow Street engro and the\nRommany chal.'\n\n'I never heard of it till now.'\n\n'All England rung of it, brother.  There never was a better match than\nbetween those two.  The runner was somewhat the stronger of the two--all\nthose engroes are strong fellows--and a great deal cooler, for all of\nthat sort are wondrous cool people--he had, however, to do with one who\nknew full well how to take his own part.  The chal fought the engro,\nbrother, in the old Roman fashion.  He bit, he kicked, and screamed like\na wild cat of Benygant; casting foam from his mouth and fire from his\neyes.  Sometimes he was beneath the engro's legs, and sometimes he was\nupon his shoulders.  What the engro found the most difficult was to get a\nfirm hold of the chal, for no sooner did he seize the chal by any part of\nhis wearing apparel, than the chal either tore himself away, or contrived\nto slip out of it; so that in a little time the chal was three parts\nnaked; and as for holding him by the body, it was out of the question,\nfor he was as slippery as an eel.  At last the engro seized the chal by\nthe Belcher's handkerchief, which he wore in a knot round his neck, and\ndo whatever the chal could, he could not free himself; and when the engro\nsaw that, it gave him fresh heart, no doubt: \"It's of no use,\" said he;\n\"you had better give in; hold out your hands for the darbies, or I will\nthrottle you.\"\n\n'And what did the other fellow do, who came with the chal?' said I.\n\n'I sat still on my horse, brother.'\n\n'You!' said I.  'Were you the man?'\n\n'I was he, brother.'\n\n'And why did you not help your comrade?'\n\n'I have fought in the ring, brother.'\n\n'And what had fighting in the ring to do with fighting in the lane?'\n\n'You mean not fighting.  A great deal, brother; it taught me to prize\nfair play.  When I fought Staffordshire Dick, t'other side of London, I\nwas alone, brother.  Not a Rommany chal to back me, and he had all his\nbrother pals about him; but they gave me fair play, brother; and I beat\nStaffordshire Dick, which I couldn't have done had they put one finger on\nhis side the scale; for he was as good a man as myself, or nearly so.\nNow, brother, had I but bent a finger in favour of the Rommany chal, the\nplastramengro would never have come alive out of the lane; but I did not,\nfor I thought to myself fair play is a precious stone; so you see,\nbrother--'\n\n'That you are quite right, Mr. Petulengro, I see that clearly; and now,\npray proceed with your narration; it is both moral and entertaining.'\n\nBut Mr. Petulengro did not proceed with his narration, neither did he\nproceed upon his way; he had stopped his horse, and his eyes were\nintently fixed on a broad strip of grass beneath some lofty trees, on the\nleft side of the road.  It was a pleasant enough spot, and seemed to\ninvite wayfaring people, such as we were, to rest from the fatigues of\nthe road, and the heat and vehemence of the sun.  After examining it for\na considerable time, Mr. Petulengro said, 'I say, brother, that would be\na nice place for a tussle!'\n\n'I daresay it would,' said I, 'if two people were inclined to fight.'\n\n'The ground is smooth,' said Mr. Petulengro; 'without holes or ruts, and\nthe trees cast much shade.  I don't think, brother, that we could find a\nbetter place,' said Mr. Petulengro, springing from his horse.\n\n'But you and I don't want to fight!'\n\n'Speak for yourself, brother,' said Mr. Petulengro.  'However, I will\ntell you how the matter stands.  There is a point at present between us.\nThere can be no doubt that you are the cause of Mrs. Herne's death,\ninnocently, you will say, but still the cause.  Now, I shouldn't like it\nto be known that I went up and down the country with a pal who was the\ncause of my mother-in-law's death, that's to say, unless he gave me\nsatisfaction.  Now, if I and my pal have a tussle, he gives me\nsatisfaction; and, if he knocks my eyes out, which I know you can't do,\nit makes no difference at all, he gives me satisfaction; and he who says\nto the contrary knows nothing of gypsy law, and is a dinelo into the\nbargain.'\n\n'But we have no gloves!'\n\n'Gloves!' said Mr. Petulengro, contemptuously, 'gloves!  I tell you what,\nbrother, I always thought you were a better hand at the gloves than the\nnaked fist; and, to tell you the truth, besides taking satisfaction for\nMrs. Herne's death, I wish to see what you can do with your mawleys; so\nnow is your time, brother, and this is your place, grass and shade, no\nruts or holes; come on, brother, or I shall think you what I should not\nlike to call you.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXII\n\n\nOffence and defence--I'm satisfied--Fond of solitude--Possession of\nproperty--Chal Devlehi--Winding path.\n\nAnd when I heard Mr. Petulengro talk in this manner, which I had never\nheard him do before, and which I can only account for by his being\nfasting and ill-tempered, I had of course no other alternative than to\naccept his challenge; so I put myself into a posture which I deemed the\nbest both for offence and defence, and the tussle commenced; and when it\nhad endured for about half an hour, Mr. Petulengro said, 'Brother, there\nis much blood on your face; you had better wipe it off'; and when I had\nwiped it off, and again resumed my former attitude, Mr. Petulengro said,\n'I think enough has been done, brother, in the affair of the old woman; I\nhave, moreover, tried what you are able to do, and find you, as I\nthought, less apt with the naked mawleys than the stuffed gloves; nay,\nbrother, put your hands down, I'm satisfied; blood has been shed, which\nis all that can be reasonably expected for an old woman who carried so\nmuch brimstone about her as Mrs. Herne.'\n\nSo the struggle ended, and we resumed our route, Mr. Petulengro sitting\nsideways upon his horse as before, and I driving my little pony-cart; and\nwhen we had proceeded about three miles, we came to a small public-house,\nwhich bore the sign of the Silent Woman, where we stopped to refresh our\ncattle and ourselves; and as we sat over our bread and ale, it came to\npass that Mr. Petulengro asked me various questions, and amongst others,\nhow I intended to dispose of myself; I told him that I did not know;\nwhereupon, with considerable frankness, he invited me to his camp, and\ntold me that if I chose to settle down amongst them, and become a Rommany\nchal, I should have his wife's sister Ursula, who was still unmarried,\nand occasionally talked of me.\n\n{picture:We came to a small public-house, which bore the sign of the\nSilent Woman, where we stopped to refresh our cattle and ourselves:\npage463.jpg}\n\nI declined his offer, assigning as a reason the recent death of Mrs.\nHerne, of which I was the cause, although innocent.  'A pretty life I\nshould lead with those two,' said I, 'when they came to know it.'  'Pooh,'\nsaid Mr. Petulengro, 'they will never know it.  I shan't blab, and as for\nLeonora, that girl has a head on her shoulders.'  'Unlike the woman in\nthe sign,' said I, 'whose head is cut off.  You speak nonsense, Mr.\nPetulengro; as long as a woman has a head on her shoulders she'll\ntalk,--but, leaving women out of the case, it is impossible to keep\nanything a secret; an old master of mine told me so long ago.  I have\nmoreover another reason for declining your offer.  I am at present not\ndisposed for society.  I am become fond of solitude.  I wish I could find\nsome quiet place to which I could retire to hold communion with my own\nthoughts, and practise, if I thought fit, either of my trades.'  'What\ntrades?' said Mr. Petulengro.  'Why, the one which I have lately been\nengaged in, or my original one, which I confess I should like better,\nthat of a kaulo-mescro.'  'Ah, I have frequently heard you talk of making\nhorse-shoes,' said Mr. Petulengro; 'I, however, never saw you make one,\nand no one else that I am aware; I don't believe--come, brother, don't be\nangry, it's quite possible that you may have done things which neither I\nnor any one else has seen you do, and that such things may some day or\nother come to light, as you say nothing can be kept secret.  Be that,\nhowever, as it may, pay the reckoning and let us be going; I think I can\nadvise you to just such a kind of place as you seem to want.'\n\n'And how do you know that I have got wherewithal to pay the reckoning?' I\ndemanded.  'Brother,' said Mr. Petulengro, 'I was just now looking in\nyour face, which exhibited the very look of a person conscious of the\npossession of property; there was nothing hungry or sneaking in it.  Pay\nthe reckoning, brother.'\n\nAnd when we were once more upon the road, Mr. Petulengro began to talk of\nthe place which he conceived would serve me as a retreat under present\ncircumstances.  'I tell you frankly, brother, that it is a queer kind of\nplace, and I am not very fond of pitching my tent in it, it is so\nsurprisingly dreary.  It is a deep dingle in the midst of a large field,\non an estate about which there has been a lawsuit for some years past.  I\ndaresay you will be quiet enough, for the nearest town is five miles\ndistant, and there are only a few huts and hedge public-houses in the\nneighbourhood.  Brother, I am fond of solitude myself, but not that kind\nof solitude; I like a quiet heath, where I can pitch my house, but I\nalways like to have a gay stirring place not far off, where the women can\npen dukkerin, and I myself can sell or buy a horse, if needful--such a\nplace as the Chong Gav.  I never feel so merry as when there, brother, or\non the heath above it, where I taught you Rommany.'\n\nShortly after this discourse we reached a milestone, and a few yards from\nthe milestone, on the left hand, was a crossroad.  Thereupon Mr.\nPetulengro said, 'Brother, my path lies to the left if you choose to go\nwith me to my camp, good; if not, Chal Devlehi.'  But I again refused Mr.\nPetulengro's invitation, and, shaking him by the hand, proceeded forward\nalone; and about ten miles farther on I reached the town of which he had\nspoken, and, following certain directions which he had given, discovered,\nthough not without some difficulty, the dingle which he had mentioned.  It\nwas a deep hollow in the midst of a wide field; the shelving sides were\novergrown with trees and bushes, a belt of sallows surrounded it on the\ntop, a steep winding path led down into the depths, practicable, however,\nfor a light cart, like mine; at the bottom was an open space, and there I\npitched my tent, and there I contrived to put up my forge.  'I will here\nply the trade of kaulomescro,' said I.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIII\n\n\nHighly poetical--Volundr--Grecian mythology--Making a petul--Tongues of\nflame--Hammering--Spite of dukkerin--Heaviness.\n\nIt has always struck me that there is something highly poetical about a\nforge.  I am not singular in this opinion: various individuals have\nassured me that they can never pass by one, even in the midst of a\ncrowded town, without experiencing sensations which they can scarcely\ndefine, but which are highly pleasurable.  I have a decided penchant for\nforges, especially rural ones, placed in some quaint quiet spot--a\ndingle, for example, which is a poetical place, or at a meeting of four\nroads, which is still more so; for how many a superstition--and\nsuperstition is the soul of poetry--is connected with these cross roads!\nI love to light upon such a one, especially after nightfall, as\neverything about a forge tells to most advantage at night; the hammer\nsounds more solemnly in the stillness; the glowing particles scattered by\nthe strokes sparkle with more effect in the darkness, whilst the sooty\nvisage of the sastramescro, half in shadow and half illumed by the red\nand partial blaze of the forge, looks more mysterious and strange.  On\nsuch occasions I draw in my horse's rein, and, seated in the saddle,\nendeavour to associate with the picture before me--in itself a picture of\nromance--whatever of the wild and wonderful I have read of in books, or\nhave seen with my own eyes in connection with forges.\n\nI believe the life of any blacksmith, especially a rural one, would\nafford materials for a highly poetical history.  I do not speak\nunadvisedly, having the honour to be free of the forge, and therefore\nfully competent to give an opinion as to what might be made out of the\nforge by some dexterous hand.  Certainly, the strangest and most\nentertaining life ever written is that of a blacksmith of the olden\nnorth, a certain Volundr, or Velint, who lived in woods and thickets,\nmade keen swords--so keen, indeed, that if placed in a running stream\nthey would fairly divide an object, however slight, which was borne\nagainst them by the water, and who eventually married a king's daughter,\nby whom he had a son, who was as bold a knight as his father was a\ncunning blacksmith.  I never see a forge at night, when seated on the\nback of my horse, at the bottom of a dark lane, but I somehow or other\nassociate it with the exploits of this extraordinary fellow, with many\nother extraordinary things, amongst which, as I have hinted before, are\nparticular passages of my own life, one or two of which I shall perhaps\nrelate to the reader.\n\nI never associate Vulcan and his Cyclops with the idea of a forge.  These\ngentry would be the very last people in the world to flit across my mind\nwhilst gazing at the forge from the bottom of the dark lane.  The truth\nis, they are highly unpoetical fellows, as well they may be, connected as\nthey are with the Grecian mythology.  At the very mention of their names\nthe forge burns dull and dim, as if snowballs had been suddenly flung\ninto it; the only remedy is to ply the bellows, an operation which I now\nhasten to perform.\n\nI am in the dingle making a horse-shoe.  Having no other horses on whose\nhoofs I could exercise my art, I made my first essay on those of my own\nhorse, if that could be called horse which horse was none, being only a\npony.  Perhaps, if I had sought all England, I should scarcely have found\nan animal more in need of the kind offices of the smith.  On three of his\nfeet there were no shoes at all, and on the fourth only a remnant of one,\non which account his hoofs were sadly broken and lacerated by his late\njourneys over the hard and flinty roads.  'You belonged to a tinker\nbefore,' said I, addressing the animal, 'but now you belong to a smith.\nIt is said that the household of the shoemaker invariably go worse shod\nthan that of any other craft.  That may be the case of those who make\nshoes of leather, but it shan't be said of the household of him who makes\nshoes of iron; at any rate it shan't be said of mine.  I tell you what,\nmy gry, whilst you continue with me, you shall both be better shod and\nbetter fed than you were with your last master.'\n\nI am in the dingle making a petul; and I must here observe that whilst I\nam making a horse-shoe the reader need not be surprised if I speak\noccasionally in the language of the lord of the horse-shoe--Mr.\nPetulengro.  I have for some time past been plying the peshota, or\nbellows, endeavouring to raise up the yag, or fire, in my primitive\nforge.  The angar, or coals, are now burning fiercely, casting forth\nsparks and long vagescoe chipes, or tongues of flame; a small bar of\nsastra, or iron, is lying in the fire, to the length of ten or twelve\ninches, and so far it is hot, very hot, exceeding hot, brother.  And now\nyou see me prala, snatch the bar of iron, and place the heated end of it\nupon the covantza, or anvil, and forthwith I commence cooring the sastra\nas hard as if I had been just engaged by a master at the rate of dui\ncaulor, or two shillings, a day, brother; and when I have beaten the iron\ntill it is nearly cool, and my arm tired, I place it again in the angar,\nand begin again to rouse the fire with the pudamengro, which signifies\nthe blowing thing, and is another and more common word for bellows; and\nwhilst thus employed I sing a gypsy song, the sound of which is\nwonderfully in unison with the hoarse moaning of the pudamengro, and ere\nthe song is finished, the iron is again hot and malleable.  Behold, I\nplace it once more on the covantza, and recommence hammering; and now I\nam somewhat at fault; I am in want of assistance; I want you, brother, or\nsome one else, to take the bar out of my hand and support it upon the\ncovantza, whilst I, applying a chinomescro, or kind of chisel, to the\nheated iron, cut off with a lusty stroke or two of the shukaro baro, or\nbig hammer, as much as is required for the petul.  But having no one to\nhelp me, I go on hammering till I have fairly knocked off as much as I\nwant, and then I place the piece in the fire, and again apply the\nbellows, and take up the song where I left it off; and when I have\nfinished the song, I take out the iron, but this time with my plaistra,\nor pincers, and then I recommence hammering, turning the iron round and\nround with my pincers: and now I bend the iron and, lo and behold! it has\nassumed something of the outline of a petul.\n\nI am not going to enter into farther details with respect to the\nprocess--it was rather a wearisome one.  I had to contend with various\ndisadvantages; my forge was a rude one, my tools might have been better;\nI was in want of one or two highly necessary implements, but, above all,\nmanual dexterity.  Though free of the forge, I had not practised the\nalbeytarian art for very many years, never since--but stay, it is not my\nintention to tell the reader, at least in this place, how and when I\nbecame a blacksmith.  There was one thing, however, which stood me in\ngood stead in my labour, the same thing which through life has ever been\nof incalculable utility to me, and has not unfrequently supplied the\nplace of friends, money, and many other things of almost equal\nimportance--iron perseverance, without which all the advantages of time\nand circumstance are of very little avail in any undertaking.  I was\ndetermined to make a horse-shoe, and a good one, in spite of every\nobstacle--ay, in spite of dukkerin.  At the end of four days, during\nwhich I had fashioned and refashioned the thing at least fifty times, I\nhad made a petul such as no master of the craft need have been ashamed\nof; with the second shoe I had less difficulty, and, by the time I had\nmade the fourth, I would have scorned to take off my hat to the best\nsmith in Cheshire.\n\nBut I had not yet shod my little gry: this I proceeded now to do.  After\nhaving first well pared the hoofs with my churi, I applied each petul\nhot, glowing hot, to the pindro.  Oh, how the hoofs hissed! and, oh, the\npleasant pungent odour which diffused itself through the dingle!--an\nodour good for an ailing spirit.\n\nI shod the little horse bravely--merely pricked him once, slightly, with\na cafi, for doing which, I remember, he kicked me down; I was not\ndisconcerted, however, but, getting up, promised to be more cautious in\nfuture; and having finished the operation, I filed the hoof well with the\nrin baro, then dismissed him to graze amongst the trees, and, putting my\nsmaller tools into the muchtar, I sat down on my stone, and, supporting\nmy arm upon my knee, leaned my head upon my hand.  Heaviness had come\nover me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIV\n\n\nSeveral causes--Frogs and eftes--Gloom and twilight--What should I\ndo?--'Our Father'--Fellow-men--What a mercy!--Almost calm--Fresh\nstore--History of Saul--Pitch dark.\n\nHeaviness had suddenly come over me, heaviness of heart, and of body\nalso.  I had accomplished the task which I had imposed upon myself, and\nnow that nothing more remained to do, my energies suddenly deserted me,\nand I felt without strength, and without hope.  Several causes, perhaps,\nco-operated to bring about the state in which I then felt myself.  It is\nnot improbable that my energies had been overstrained during the work the\nprogress of which I have attempted to describe; and every one is aware\nthat the results of overstrained energies are feebleness and\nlassitude--want of nourishment might likewise have something to do with\nit.  During my sojourn in the dingle, my food had been of the simplest\nand most unsatisfying description, by no means calculated to support the\nexertion which the labour I had been engaged upon required; it had\nconsisted of coarse oaten cakes and hard cheese, and for beverage I had\nbeen indebted to a neighbouring pit, in which, in the heat of the day, I\nfrequently saw, not golden or silver fish, but frogs and eftes swimming\nabout.  I am, however, inclined to believe that Mrs. Herne's cake had\nquite as much to do with the matter as insufficient nourishment.  I had\nnever entirely recovered from the effects of its poison, but had\noccasionally, especially at night, been visited by a grinding pain in the\nstomach, and my whole body had been suffused with cold sweat; and indeed\nthese memorials of the drow have never entirely disappeared--even at the\npresent time they display themselves in my system, especially after much\nfatigue of body and excitement of mind.  So there I sat in the dingle\nupon my stone, nerveless and hopeless, by whatever cause or causes that\nstate had been produced--there I sat with my head leaning upon my hand,\nand so I continued a long, long time.  At last I lifted my head from my\nhand, and began to cast anxious, unquiet looks about the dingle--the\nentire hollow was now enveloped in deep shade--I cast my eyes up; there\nwas a golden gleam on the tops of the trees which grew towards the upper\nparts of the dingle; but lower down all was gloom and twilight--yet, when\nI first sat down on my stone, the sun was right above the dingle,\nilluminating all its depths by the rays which it cast perpendicularly\ndown--so I must have sat a long, long time upon my stone.  And now, once\nmore, I rested my head upon my hand, but almost instantly lifted it again\nin a kind of fear, and began looking at the objects before me--the forge,\nthe tools, the branches of the trees, endeavouring to follow their rows,\ntill they were lost in the darkness of the dingle; and now I found my\nright hand grasping convulsively the three fore-fingers of the left,\nfirst collectively, and then successively, wringing them till the joints\ncracked; then I became quiet, but not for long.\n\nSuddenly I started up, and could scarcely repress the shriek which was\nrising to my lips.  Was it possible?  Yes, all too certain; the evil one\nwas upon me; the inscrutable horror which I had felt in my boyhood had\nonce more taken possession of me.  I had thought that it had forsaken\nme--that it would never visit me again; that I had outgrown it; that I\nmight almost bid defiance to it; and I had even begun to think of it\nwithout horror, as we are in the habit of doing of horrors of which we\nconceive we run no danger; and lo! when least thought of, it had seized\nme again.  Every moment I felt it gathering force, and making me more\nwholly its own.  What should I do?--resist, of course; and I did resist.\nI grasped, I tore, and strove to fling it from me; but of what avail were\nmy efforts?  I could only have got rid of it by getting rid of myself: it\nwas a part of myself, or rather it was all myself.  I rushed amongst the\ntrees, and struck at them with my bare fists, and dashed my head against\nthem, but I felt no pain.  How could I feel pain with that horror upon\nme?  And then I flung myself on the ground, gnawed the earth, and\nswallowed it; and then I looked round; it was almost total darkness in\nthe dingle, and the darkness added to my horror.  I could no longer stay\nthere; up I rose from the ground, and attempted to escape.  At the bottom\nof the winding path which led up the acclivity I fell over something\nwhich was lying on the ground; the something moved, and gave a kind of\nwhine.  It was my little horse, which had made that place its lair; my\nlittle horse; my only companion and friend in that now awful solitude.  I\nreached the mouth of the dingle; the sun was just sinking in the far west\nbehind me, the fields were flooded with his last gleams.  How beautiful\neverything looked in the last gleams of the sun!  I felt relieved for a\nmoment; I was no longer in the horrid dingle.  In another minute the sun\nwas gone, and a big cloud occupied the place where he had been: in a\nlittle time it was almost as dark as it had previously been in the open\npart of the dingle.  My horror increased; what was I to do?--it was of no\nuse fighting against the horror--that I saw; the more I fought against\nit, the stronger it became.  What should I do: say my prayers?  Ah! why\nnot?  So I knelt down under the hedge, and said, 'Our Father'; but that\nwas of no use; and now I could no longer repress cries--the horror was\ntoo great to be borne.  What should I do? run to the nearest town or\nvillage, and request the assistance of my fellow-men?  No! that I was\nashamed to do; notwithstanding the horror was upon me, I was ashamed to\ndo that.  I knew they would consider me a maniac, if I went screaming\namongst them; and I did not wish to be considered a maniac.  Moreover, I\nknew that I was not a maniac, for I possessed all my reasoning powers,\nonly the horror was upon me--the screaming horror!  But how were\nindifferent people to distinguish between madness and the screaming\nhorror?  So I thought and reasoned; and at last I determined not to go\namongst my fellow-men, whatever the result might be.  I went to the mouth\nof the dingle, and there, placing myself on my knees, I again said the\nLord's Prayer; but it was of no use--praying seemed to have no effect\nover the horror; the unutterable fear appeared rather to increase than\ndiminish, and I again uttered wild cries, so loud that I was apprehensive\nthey would be heard by some chance passenger on the neighbouring road; I\ntherefore went deeper into the dingle.  I sat down with my back against a\nthorn bush; the thorns entered my flesh, and when I felt them, I pressed\nharder against the bush; I thought the pain of the flesh might in some\ndegree counteract the mental agony; presently I felt them no longer--the\npower of the mental horror was so great that it was impossible, with that\nupon me, to feel any pain from the thorns.  I continued in this posture a\nlong time, undergoing what I cannot describe, and would not attempt if I\nwere able.  Several times I was on the point of starting up and rushing\nanywhere; but I restrained myself, for I knew I could not escape from\nmyself, so why should I not remain in the dingle?  So I thought and said\nto myself, for my reasoning powers were still uninjured.  At last it\nappeared to me that the horror was not so strong, not quite so strong,\nupon me.  Was it possible that it was relaxing its grasp, releasing its\nprey?  Oh what a mercy! but it could not be; and yet--I looked up to\nheaven, and clasped my hands, and said, 'Our Father.'  I said no more--I\nwas too agitated; and now I was almost sure that the horror had done its\nworst.\n\n{picture:I knelt down under the hedge and said, 'Our Father'; but that\nwas of no use: page472.jpg}\n\nAfter a little time I arose, and staggered down yet farther into the\ndingle.  I again found my little horse on the same spot as before.  I put\nmy hand to his mouth--he licked my hand.  I flung myself down by him, and\nput my arms round his neck; the creature whinnied, and appeared to\nsympathise with me.  What a comfort to have any one, even a dumb brute,\nto sympathise with me at such a moment!  I clung to my little horse, as\nif for safety and protection.  I laid my head on his neck, and felt\nalmost calm.  Presently the fear returned, but not so wild as before; it\nsubsided, came again, again subsided; then drowsiness came over me, and\nat last I fell asleep, my head supported on the neck of the little horse.\nI awoke; it was dark, dark night--not a star was to be seen--but I felt\nno fear, the horror had left me.  I arose from the side of the little\nhorse, and went into my tent, lay down, and again went to sleep.\n\nI awoke in the morning weak and sore, and shuddering at the remembrance\nof what I had gone through on the preceding day; the sun was shining\nbrightly, but it had not yet risen high enough to show its head above the\ntrees which fenced the eastern side of the dingle, on which account the\ndingle was wet and dank from the dews of the night.  I kindled my fire,\nand, after sitting by it for some time to warm my frame, I took some of\nthe coarse food which I have already mentioned; notwithstanding my late\nstruggle, and the coarseness of the fare, I ate with appetite.  My\nprovisions had by this time been very much diminished, and I saw that it\nwould be speedily necessary, in the event of my continuing to reside in\nthe dingle, to lay in a fresh store.  After my meal, I went to the pit\nand filled a can with water, which I brought to the dingle, and then\nagain sat down on my stone.  I considered what I should next do: it was\nnecessary to do something, or my life in this solitude would be\ninsupportable.  What should I do? rouse up my forge and fashion a horse-\nshoe?  But I wanted nerve and heart for such an employment; moreover, I\nhad no motive for fatiguing myself in this manner; my own horse was shod,\nno other was at hand, and it is hard to work for the sake of working.\nWhat should I do? read?  Yes, but I had no other book than the Bible\nwhich the Welsh Methodist had given me.  Well, why not read the Bible? I\nwas once fond of reading the Bible; ay, but those days were long gone by.\nHowever, I did not see what else I could well do on the present\noccasion--so I determined to read the Bible--it was in Welsh; at any rate\nit might amuse me.  So I took the Bible out of the sack, in which it was\nlying in the cart, and began to read at the place where I chanced to open\nit.  I opened it at that part where the history of Saul commences.  At\nfirst I read with indifference, but after some time my attention was\nriveted, and no wonder, I had come to the visitations of Saul--those dark\nmoments of his, when he did and said such unaccountable things; it almost\nappeared to me that I was reading of myself; I, too, had my visitations,\ndark as ever his were.  Oh, how I sympathised with Saul, the tall dark\nman!  I had read his life before, but it had made no impression on me; it\nhad never occurred to me that I was like him; but I now sympathised with\nSaul, for my own dark hour was but recently passed, and, perhaps, would\nsoon return again; the dark hour came frequently on Saul.\n\nTime wore away; I finished the book of Saul, and, closing the volume,\nreturned it to its place.  I then returned to my seat on the stone, and\nthought of what I had read, and what I had lately undergone.  All at once\nI thought I felt well-known sensations, a cramping of the breast, and a\ntingling of the soles of the feet; they were what I had felt on the\npreceding day--they were the forerunners of the fear.  I sat motionless\non my stone, the sensations passed away, and the fear came not.  Darkness\nwas now coming again over the earth; the dingle was again in deep shade;\nI roused the fire with the breath of the bellows, and sat looking at the\ncheerful glow; it was cheering and comforting.  My little horse came now\nand lay down on the ground beside the forge; I was not quite deserted.  I\nagain ate some of the coarse food, and drank plentifully of the water\nwhich I had fetched in the morning.  I then put fresh fuel on the fire,\nand sat for a long time looking on the blaze; I then went into my tent.\n\nI awoke, on my own calculation, about midnight--it was pitch dark, and\nthere was much fear upon me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXV\n\n\nFree and independent--I don't see why--Oats--A noise--Unwelcome\nvisitors--What's the matter?--Good-day to ye--The tall\ngirl--Dovrefeld--Blow on the face--Civil enough--What's this?--Vulgar\nwoman--Hands off--Gasping for breath--Long Melford--A pretty manoeuvre--A\nlong draught--Signs of animation--It won't do--No malice--Bad people.\n\nTwo mornings after the period to which I have brought the reader in the\npreceding chapter, I sat by my fire at the bottom of the dingle; I had\njust breakfasted, and had finished the last morsel of food which I had\nbrought with me to that solitude.\n\n'What shall I now do?' said I to myself; 'shall I continue here, or\ndecamp?--this is a sad lonely spot--perhaps I had better quit it; but\nwhither shall I go? the wide world is before me, but what can I do\ntherein?  I have been in the world already without much success.  No, I\nhad better remain here; the place is lonely, it is true, but here I am\nfree and independent, and can do what I please; but I can't remain here\nwithout food.  Well, I will find my way to the nearest town, lay in a\nfresh supply of provision, and come back, turning my back upon the world,\nwhich has turned its back upon me.  I don't see why I should not write a\nlittle sometimes; I have pens and an ink-horn, and for a writing-desk I\ncan place the Bible on my knee.  I shouldn't wonder if I could write a\ncapital satire on the world on the back of that Bible; but, first of all,\nI must think of supplying myself with food.'\n\nI rose up from the stone on which I was seated, determining to go to the\nnearest town, with my little horse and cart, and procure what I wanted.\nThe nearest town, according to my best calculation, lay about five miles\ndistant; I had no doubt, however, that, by using ordinary diligence, I\nshould be back before evening.  In order to go lighter, I determined to\nleave my tent standing as it was, and all the things which I had\npurchased of the tinker, just as they were.  'I need not be apprehensive\non their account,' said I to myself; 'nobody will come here to meddle\nwith them--the great recommendation of this place is its perfect\nsolitude--I daresay that I could live here six months without seeing a\nsingle human visage.  I will now harness my little gry and be off to the\ntown.'\n\nAt a whistle which I gave, the little gry, which was feeding on the bank\nnear the uppermost part of the dingle, came running to me, for by this\ntime he had become so accustomed to me that he would obey my call, for\nall the world as if he had been one of the canine species.  'Now,' said I\nto him, 'we are going to the town to buy bread for myself and oats for\nyou--I am in a hurry to be back; therefore I pray you to do your best,\nand to draw me and the cart to the town with all possible speed, and to\nbring us back; if you do your best, I promise you oats on your return.\nYou know the meaning of oats, Ambrol?'  Ambrol whinnied as if to let me\nknow that he understood me perfectly well, as indeed he well might, as I\nhad never once fed him during the time that he had been in my possession\nwithout saying the word in question to him.  Now, Ambrol, in the gypsy\ntongue, signifieth a pear.\n\nSo I caparisoned Ambrol, and then, going to the cart, I removed two or\nthree things from it into the tent; I then lifted up the shafts, and was\njust going to call to the pony to come and be fastened to them, when I\nthought I heard a noise.\n\nI stood stock still, supporting the shaft of the little cart in my hand,\nand bending the right side of my face slightly towards the ground, but I\ncould hear nothing; the noise which I thought I had heard was not one of\nthose sounds which I was accustomed to hear in that solitude--the note of\na bird, or the rustling of a bough; it was--there I heard it again, a\nsound very much resembling the grating of a wheel amongst gravel.  Could\nit proceed from the road?  Oh no, the road was too far distant for me to\nhear the noise of anything moving along it. Again I listened, and now I\ndistinctly heard the sound of wheels, which seemed to be approaching the\ndingle; nearer and nearer they drew, and presently the sound of wheels\nwas blended with the murmur of voices.  Anon I heard a boisterous shout,\nwhich seemed to proceed from the entrance of the dingle.  'Here are folks\nat hand,' said I, letting the shaft of the cart fall to the ground; 'is\nit possible that they can be coming here?'  My doubts on that point, if I\nentertained any, were soon dispelled; the wheels, which had ceased moving\nfor a moment or two, were once again in motion, and were now evidently\nmoving down the winding path which led to my retreat.  Leaving my cart, I\ncame forward and placed myself near the entrance of the open space, with\nmy eyes fixed on the path down which my unexpected, and I may say\nunwelcome, visitors were coming.  Presently I heard a stamping or\nsliding, as if of a horse in some difficulty; then a loud curse, and the\nnext moment appeared a man and a horse and cart; the former holding the\nhead of the horse up to prevent him from falling, of which he was in\ndanger, owing to the precipitous nature of the path.  Whilst thus\noccupied, the head of the man was averted from me.  When, however, he had\nreached the bottom of the descent, he turned his head, and perceiving me,\nas I stood bareheaded, without either coat or waistcoat, about two yards\nfrom him, he gave a sudden start, so violent that the backward motion of\nhis hand had nearly flung the horse upon his haunches.\n\n'Why don't you move forward?' said a voice from behind, apparently that\nof a female; 'you are stopping up the way, and we shall be all down upon\none another'; and I saw the head of another horse overtopping the back of\nthe cart.\n\n'Why don't you move forward, Jack?' said another voice, also a female,\nyet higher up the path.\n\nThe man stirred not, but remained staring at me in the posture which he\nhad assumed on first perceiving me, his body very much drawn back, his\nleft foot far in advance of his right, and with his right hand still\ngrasping the halter of the horse, which gave way more and more, till it\nwas clean down on its haunches.\n\n'What's the matter?' said the voice which I had last heard.\n\n'Get back with you, Belle, Moll,' said the man, still staring at me;\n'here's something not over canny or comfortable.'\n\n'What is it?' said the same voice; 'let me pass, Moll, and I'll soon\nclear the way'; and I heard a kind of rushing down the path.\n\n'You need not be afraid,' said I, addressing myself to the man, 'I mean\nyou no harm; I am a wanderer like yourself--come here to seek for\nshelter--you need not be afraid; I am a Roman chabo by matriculation--one\nof the right sort, and no mistake--Good-day to ye, brother; I bid ye\nwelcome.'\n\nThe man eyed me suspiciously for a moment--then, turning to his horse\nwith a loud curse, he pulled him up from his haunches, and led him and\nthe cart farther down to one side of the dingle, muttering, as he passed\nme, 'Afraid!  Hm!'\n\nI do not remember ever to have seen a more ruffianly-looking fellow; he\nwas about six feet high, with an immensely athletic frame; his face was\nblack and bluff, and sported an immense pair of whiskers, but with here\nand there a gray hair, for his age could not be much under fifty.  He\nwore a faded blue frock-coat, corduroys, and highlows; on his black head\nwas a kind of red nightcap, round his bull neck a Barcelona\nhandkerchief--I did not like the look of the man at all.\n\n'Afraid!' growled the fellow, proceeding to unharness his horse; 'that\nwas the word, I think.'\n\nBut other figures were now already upon the scene.  Dashing past the\nother horse and cart, which by this time had reached the bottom of the\npass, appeared an exceedingly tall woman, or rather girl, for she could\nscarcely have been above eighteen; she was dressed in a tight bodice and\na blue stuff gown; hat, bonnet, or cap she had none, and her hair, which\nwas flaxen, hung down on her shoulders unconfined; her complexion was\nfair, and her features handsome, with a determined but open\nexpression--she was followed by another female, about forty, stout and\nvulgar-looking, at whom I scarcely glanced, my whole attention being\nabsorbed by the tall girl.\n\n'What's the matter, Jack?' said the latter, looking at the man.\n\n'Only afraid, that's all,' said the man, still proceeding with his work.\n\n'Afraid at what--at that lad? why, he looks like a ghost--I would engage\nto thrash him with one hand.'\n\n'You might beat me with no hands at all,' said I, 'fair damsel, only by\nlooking at me--I never saw such a face and figure, both regal--why, you\nlook like Ingeborg, Queen of Norway; she had twelve brothers, you know,\nand could lick them all, though they were heroes:--\n\n   On Dovrefeld in Norway\n   Were once together seen\n   The twelve heroic brothers\n   Of Ingeborg the queen.'\n\n'None of your chaffing, young fellow,' said the tall girl, 'or I will\ngive you what shall make you wipe your face; be civil, or you will rue\nit.'\n\n'Well, perhaps I was a peg too high,' said I; 'I ask your pardon--here's\nsomething a bit lower:--\n\n   As I was jawing to the gav yeck divvus\n   I met on the drom miro Rommany chi--'\n\nNone of your Rommany chies, young fellow,' said the tall girl, looking\nmore menacingly than before, and clenching her fist; 'you had better be\ncivil, I am none of your chies; and though I keep company with gypsies,\nor, to speak more proper, half-and-halfs, I would have you to know that I\ncome of Christian blood and parents, and was born in the great house of\nLong Melford.'\n\n'I have no doubt,' said I, 'that it was a great house; judging from your\nsize I shouldn't wonder if you were born in a church.'\n\n'Stay, Belle,' said the man, putting himself before the young virago, who\nwas about to rush upon me, 'my turn is first'--then, advancing to me in a\nmenacing attitude, he said, with a look of deep malignity, '\"Afraid,\" was\nthe word, wasn't it?'\n\n'It was,' said I, 'but I think I wronged you; I should have said, aghast;\nyou exhibited every symptom of one labouring under uncontrollable fear.'\n\nThe fellow stared at me with a look of stupid ferocity, and appeared to\nbe hesitating whether to strike or not: ere he could make up his mind,\nthe tall girl started forward, crying, 'He's chaffing; let me at him';\nand before I could put myself on my guard, she struck me a blow on the\nface which had nearly brought me to the ground.\n\n{picture:The fellow stared at me with a look of stupid ferocity, and\nappeared to be hesitating whether to strike or not: page480.jpg}\n\n'Enough,' said I, putting my hand to my cheek; 'you have now performed\nyour promise, and made me wipe my face: now be pacified, and tell me\nfairly the grounds of this quarrel.'\n\n'Grounds!' said the fellow; 'didn't you say I was afraid; and if you\nhadn't, who gave you leave to camp on my ground?'\n\n'Is it your ground?' said I.\n\n'A pretty question,' said the fellow; 'as if all the world didn't know\nthat.  Do you know who I am?'\n\n'I guess I do,' said I; 'unless I am much mistaken, you are he whom folks\ncall the \"Flaming Tinman.\"  To tell you the truth, I'm glad we have met,\nfor I wished to see you.  These are your two wives, I suppose; I greet\nthem.  There's no harm done--there's room enough here for all of us--we\nshall soon be good friends, I daresay; and when we are a little better\nacquainted, I'll tell you my history.'\n\n'Well, if that doesn't beat all!' said the fellow.\n\n'I don't think he's chaffing now,' said the girl, whose anger seemed to\nhave subsided on a sudden; 'the young man speaks civil enough.'\n\n'Civil!' said the fellow, with an oath; 'but that's just like you; with\nyou it is a blow, and all over.  Civil!  I suppose you would have him\nstay here, and get into all my secrets, and hear all I may have to say to\nmy two morts.'\n\n'Two morts!' said the girl, kindling up, 'where are they?  Speak for one,\nand no more.  I am no mort of yours, whatever some one else may be.  I\ntell you one thing, Black John, or Anselo,--for t'other ain't your\nname,--the same thing I told the young man here, be civil, or you will\nrue it.'\n\nThe fellow looked at the girl furiously, but his glance soon quailed\nbefore hers; he withdrew his eyes, and cast them on my little horse,\nwhich was feeding amongst the trees.  'What's this?' said he, rushing\nforward and seizing the animal.  'Why, as I am alive, this is the horse\nof that mumping villain Slingsby.'\n\n'It's his no longer; I bought it and paid for it.'\n\n'It's mine now,' said the fellow; 'I swore I would seize it the next time\nI found it on my beat; ay, and beat the master too.'\n\n'I am not Slingsby.'\n\n'All's one for that.'\n\n'You don't say you will beat me?'\n\n'Afraid was the word.'\n\n'I'm sick and feeble.'\n\n'Hold up your fists.'\n\n'Won't the horse satisfy you?'\n\n'Horse nor bellows either.'\n\n'No mercy, then?'\n\n'Here's at you.'\n\n'Mind your eyes, Jack.  There, you've got it.  I thought so,' shouted the\ngirl, as the fellow staggered back from a sharp blow in the eye; 'I\nthought he was chaffing at you all along.'\n\n'Never mind, Anselo.  You know what to do--go in,' said the vulgar woman,\nwho had hitherto not spoken a word, but who now came forward with all the\nlook of a fury; 'go inapopli; you'll smash ten like he.'\n\nThe Flaming Tinman took her advice, and came in bent on smashing, but\nstopped short on receiving a left-handed blow on the nose.\n\n'You'll never beat the Flaming Tinman in that way,' said the girl,\nlooking at me doubtfully.\n\nAnd so I began to think myself, when, in the twinkling of an eye, the\nFlaming Tinman, disengaging himself of his frock-coat, and dashing off\nhis red night-cap, came rushing in more desperately than ever.  To a\nflush hit which he received in the mouth he paid as little attention as a\nwild bull would have done; in a moment his arms were around me, and in\nanother he had hurled me down, falling heavily upon me.  The fellow's\nstrength appeared to be tremendous.\n\n'Pay him off now,' said the vulgar woman.  The Flaming Tinman made no\nreply, but, planting his knee on my breast, seized my throat with two\nhuge horny hands.  I gave myself up for dead, and probably should have\nbeen so in another minute but for the tall girl, who caught hold of the\nhandkerchief which the fellow wore round his neck, with a grasp nearly as\npowerful us that with which he pressed my throat.\n\n'Do you call that fair play?' said she.\n\n'Hands off, Belle,' said the other woman; 'do you call it fair play to\ninterfere? hands off, or I'll be down upon you myself.'\n\nBut Belle paid no heed to the injunction, and tugged so hard at the\nhandkerchief that the Flaming Tinman was nearly throttled; suddenly\nrelinquishing his hold of me, he started on his feet, and aimed a blow at\nmy fair preserver, who avoided it, but said coolly:--\n\n'Finish t'other business first, and then I'm your woman whenever you\nlike; but finish it fairly--no foul play when I'm by--I'll be the boy's\nsecond, and Moll can pick up you when he happens to knock you down.'\n\nThe battle during the next ten minutes raged with considerable fury, but\nit so happened that during this time I was never able to knock the\nFlaming Tinman down, but on the contrary received six knock-down blows\nmyself.  'I can never stand this,' said I, as I sat on the knee of Belle,\n'I am afraid I must give in; the Flaming Tinman hits very hard,' and I\nspat out a mouthful of blood.\n\n'Sure enough you'll never beat the Flaming Tinman in the way you\nfight--it's of no use flipping at the Flaming Tinman with your left hand;\nwhy don't you use your right?'\n\n'Because I'm not handy with it,' said I; and then getting up, I once more\nconfronted the Flaming Tinman, and struck him six blows for his one, but\nthey were all left-handed blows, and the blow which the Flaming Tinman\ngave me knocked me off my legs.\n\n'Now, will you use Long Melford?' said Belle, picking me up.\n\n'I don't know what you mean by Long Melford,' said I, gasping for breath.\n\n'Why, this long right of yours,' said Belle, feeling my right arm; 'if\nyou do, I shouldn't wonder if you yet stand a chance.'  And now the\nFlaming Tinman was once more ready, much more ready than myself.  I,\nhowever, rose from my second's knee as well as my weakness would permit\nme.  On he came, striking left and right, appearing almost as fresh as to\nwind and spirit as when he first commenced the combat, though his eyes\nwere considerably swelled, and his nether lip was cut in two; on he came,\nstriking left and right, and I did not like his blows at all, or even the\nwind of them, which was anything but agreeable, and I gave way before\nhim.  At last he aimed a blow which, had it taken full effect, would\ndoubtless have ended the battle, but owing to his slipping, the fist only\ngrazed my left shoulder, and came with terrific force against a tree,\nclose to which I had been driven; before the Tinman could recover\nhimself, I collected all my strength, and struck him beneath the ear, and\nthen fell to the ground completely exhausted; and it so happened that the\nblow which I struck the Tinker beneath the ear was a right-handed blow.\n\n{picture:His eyes were considerably swelled, and his nether lip was cut\nin two: page483.jpg}\n\n'Hurrah for Long Melford!' I heard Belle exclaim; 'there is nothing like\nLong Melford for shortness, all the world over.'  At these words I turned\nround my head as I lay, and perceived the Flaming Tinman stretched upon\nthe ground apparently senseless.  'He is dead,' said the vulgar woman, as\nshe vainly endeavoured to raise him up; 'he is dead; the best man in all\nthe north country, killed in this fashion, by a boy!'  Alarmed at these\nwords, I made shift to get on my feet; and, with the assistance of the\nwoman, placed my fallen adversary in a sitting posture.  I put my hand to\nhis heart, and felt a slight pulsation--'He's not dead,' said I, 'only\nstunned; if he were let blood, he would recover presently.'  I produced a\npenknife which I had in my pocket, and, baring the arm of the Tinman, was\nabout to make the necessary incision, when the woman gave me a violent\nblow, and, pushing me aside, exclaimed, 'I'll tear the eyes out of your\nhead if you offer to touch him.  Do you want to complete your work, and\nmurder him outright, now he's asleep? you have had enough of his blood\nalready.'  'You are mad,' said I, 'I only seek to do him service.  Well,\nif you won't let him be blooded, fetch some water and fling it in his\nface, you know where the pit is.'\n\n{picture:It so happened that the blow which I struck the Tinker beneath\nthe ear was a right-handed blow: page485.jpg}\n\n'A pretty manoeuvre!' said the woman; 'leave my husband in the hands of\nyou and that limmer, who has never been true to us--I should find him\nstrangled or his throat cut when I came back.'  'Do you go,' said I to\nthe tall girl; 'take the can and fetch some water from the pit.'  'You\nhad better go yourself,' said the girl, wiping a tear as she looked on\nthe yet senseless form of the Tinker; 'you had better go yourself, if you\nthink water will do him good.'  I had by this time somewhat recovered my\nexhausted powers, and, taking the can, I bent my steps as fast as I could\nto the pit; arriving there, I lay down on the brink, took a long draught,\nand then plunged my head into the water; after which I filled the can,\nand bent my way back to the dingle.  Before I could reach the path which\nled down into its depths, I had to pass some way along its side; I had\narrived at a part immediately over the scene of the last encounter, where\nthe bank, overgrown with trees, sloped precipitously down.  Here I heard\na loud sound of voices in the dingle; I stopped, and laying hold of a\ntree, leaned over the bank and listened.  The two women appeared to be in\nhot dispute in the dingle.  'It was all owing to you, you limmer,' said\nthe vulgar woman to the other; 'had you not interfered, the old man would\nsoon have settled the boy.'\n\n'I'm for fair play and Long Melford,' said the other.  'If your old man,\nas you call him, could have settled the boy fairly, he might for all I\nshould have cared, but no foul work for me, and as for sticking the boy\nwith our gulleys when he comes back, as you proposed, I am not so fond of\nyour old man or you that I should oblige you in it, to my soul's\ndestruction.'  'Hold your tongue, or I'll--'  I listened no farther, but\nhastened as fast as I could to the dingle.  My adversary had just begun\nto show signs of animation; the vulgar woman was still supporting him,\nand occasionally cast glances of anger at the tall girl, who was walking\nslowly up and down.  I lost no time in dashing the greater part of the\nwater into the Tinman's face, whereupon he sneezed, moved his hands, and\npresently looked round him.  At first his looks were dull and heavy, and\nwithout any intelligence at all; he soon, however, began to recollect\nhimself, and to be conscious of his situation; he cast a scowling glance\nat me, then one of the deepest malignity at the tall girl, who was still\nwalking about without taking much notice of what was going forward.  At\nlast he looked at his right hand, which had evidently suffered from the\nblow against the tree, and a half-stifled curse escaped his lips.  The\nvulgar woman now said something to him in a low tone, whereupon he looked\nat her for a moment, and then got upon his legs.  Again the vulgar woman\nsaid something to him; her looks were furious, and she appeared to be\nurging him on to attempt something.  I observed that she had a clasped\nknife in her hand.  The fellow remained standing for some time as if\nhesitating what to do; at last he looked at his hand, and, shaking his\nhead, said something to the woman which I did not understand.  The tall\ngirl, however, appeared to overhear him, and, probably repeating his\nwords, said, 'No, it won't do; you are right there; and now hear what I\nhave to say,--let bygones be bygones, and let us all shake hands, and\ncamp here, as the young man was saying just now.'  The man looked at her,\nand then, without any reply, went to his horse, which was lying down\namong the trees, and kicking it up, led it to the cart, to which he\nforthwith began to harness it.  The other cart and horse had remained\nstanding motionless during the whole affair which I have been recounting,\nat the bottom of the pass.  The woman now took the horse by the head, and\nleading it with the cart into the open part of the dingle, turned both\nround, and then led them back, till the horse and cart had mounted a\nlittle way up the ascent; she then stood still and appeared to be\nexpecting the man.  During this proceeding Belle had stood looking on\nwithout saying anything; at last, perceiving that the man had harnessed\nhis horse to the other cart, and that both he and the woman were about to\ntake their departure, she said, 'You are not going, are you?'  Receiving\nno answer, she continued: 'I tell you what, both of you, Black John, and\nyou Moll, his mort, this is not treating me over civilly,--however, I am\nready to put up with it, and to go with you if you like, for I bear no\nmalice.  I'm sorry for what has happened, but you have only yourselves to\nthank for it.  Now, shall I go with you, only tell me?'  The man made no\nmanner of reply, but flogged his horse.  The woman, however, whose\npassions were probably under less control, replied, with a screeching\ntone, 'Stay where you are, you jade, and may the curse of Judas cling to\nyou,--stay with the bit of a mullo whom you helped, and my only hope is\nthat he may gulley you before he comes to be . . . . Have you with us,\nindeed! after what's past! no, nor nothing belonging to you.  Fetch down\nyour mailia go-cart and live here with your chabo.'  She then whipped on\nthe horse, and ascended the pass, followed by the man.  The carts were\nlight, and they were not long in ascending the winding path.  I followed\nto see that they took their departure.  Arriving at the top, I found near\nthe entrance a small donkey-cart, which I concluded belonged to the girl.\nThe tinker and his mort were already at some distance; I stood looking\nafter them for a little time, then taking the donkey by the reins I led\nit with the cart to the bottom of the dingle.  Arrived there, I found\nBelle seated on the stone by the fireplace.  Her hair was all\ndishevelled, and she was in tears.\n\n'They were bad people,' said she, 'and I did not like them, but they were\nmy only acquaintance in the wide world.'\n\n{picture:The tinker and his mort were already at some distance; I stood\nlooking after them for a little time: page488.jpg}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVI\n\n\nAt tea--Vapours--Isopel Berners--Softly and kindly--Sweet pretty\ncreature--Bread and water--Two sailors--Truth and constancy--Very\nstrangely.\n\nIn the evening of that same day the tall girl and I sat at tea by the\nfire, at the bottom of the dingle; the girl on a small stool, and myself,\nas usual, upon my stone.\n\nThe water which served for the tea had been taken from a spring of\npellucid water in the neighbourhood, which I had not had the good fortune\nto discover, though it was well known to my companion, and to the\nwandering people who frequented the dingle.\n\n'This tea is very good,' said I, 'but I cannot enjoy it as much as if I\nwere well: I feel very sadly.'\n\n'How else should you feel,' said the girl, 'after fighting with the\nFlaming Tinman?  All I wonder at is that you can feel at all!  As for the\ntea, it ought to be good, seeing that it cost me ten shillings a pound.'\n\n'That's a great deal for a person in your station to pay.'\n\n'In my station!  I'd have you to know, young man--however, I haven't the\nheart to quarrel with you, you look so ill; and after all, it is a good\nsum for one to pay who travels the roads; but if I must have tea, I like\nto have the best; and tea I must have, for I am used to it, though I\ncan't help thinking that it sometimes fills my head with strange\nfancies--what some folks call vapours, making me weep and cry.'\n\n'Dear me,' said I, 'I should never have thought that one of your size and\nfierceness would weep and cry!'\n\n'My size and fierceness!  I tell you what, young man, you are not over\ncivil this evening; but you are ill, as I said before, and I shan't take\nmuch notice of your language, at least for the present; as for my size, I\nam not so much bigger than yourself; and as for being fierce, you should\nbe the last one to fling that at me.  It is well for you that I can be\nfierce sometimes.  If I hadn't taken your part against Blazing Bosville,\nyou wouldn't be now taking tea with me.'\n\n'It is true that you struck me in the face first; but we'll let that\npass.  So that man's name is Bosville; what's your own?'\n\n'Isopel Berners.'\n\n{picture:Isopel Berners: page491.jpg}\n\n'How did you get that name?'\n\n'I say, young man, you seem fond of asking questions: will you have\nanother cup of tea?'\n\n'I was just going to ask for another.'\n\n'Well, then, here it is, and much good may it do you; as for my name, I\ngot it from my mother.'\n\n'Your mother's name, then, was Isopel!'\n\n'Isopel Berners.'\n\n'But had you never a father?'\n\n'Yes, I had a father,' said the girl, sighing, 'but I don't bear his\nname.'\n\n'Is it the fashion, then, in your country for children to bear their\nmother's name?'\n\n'If you ask such questions, young man, I shall be angry with you.  I have\ntold you my name, and, whether my father's or mother's, I am not ashamed\nof it.'\n\n'It is a noble name.'\n\n'There you are right, young man.  The chaplain in the great house where I\nwas born told me it was a noble name; it was odd enough, he said, that\nthe only three noble names in the county were to be found in the great\nhouse; mine was one; the other two were Devereux and Bohun.'\n\n'What do you mean by the great house?'\n\n'The workhouse.'\n\n'Is it possible that you were born there?'\n\n'Yes, young man; and as you now speak softly and kindly, I will tell you\nmy whole tale.  My father was an officer of the sea, and was killed at\nsea as he was coming home to marry my mother, Isopel Berners.  He had\nbeen acquainted with her, and had left her; but after a few months he\nwrote her a letter, to say that he had no rest, and that he repented, and\nthat as soon as his ship came to port he would do her all the reparation\nin his power.  Well, young man, the very day before they reached port\nthey met the enemy, and there was a fight, and my father was killed,\nafter he had struck down six of the enemy's crew on their own deck; for\nmy father was a big man, as I have heard, and knew tolerably well how to\nuse his hands, And when my mother heard the news, she became half\ndistracted, and ran away into the fields and forests, totally neglecting\nher business, for she was a small milliner; and so she ran demented about\nthe meads and forests for a long time, now sitting under a tree, and now\nby the side of a river--at last she flung herself into some water, and\nwould have been drowned, had not some one been at hand and rescued her,\nwhereupon she was conveyed to the great house, lest she should attempt to\ndo herself farther mischief, for she had neither friends nor parents--and\nthere she died three months after, having first brought me into the\nworld.  She was a sweet pretty creature, I'm told, but hardly fit for\nthis world, being neither large, nor fierce, nor able to take her own\npart.  So I was born and bred in the great house, where I learnt to read\nand sew, to fear God, and to take my own part.  When I was fourteen I was\nput out to service to a small farmer and his wife, with whom, however, I\ndid not stay long, for I was half-starved, and otherwise ill treated,\nespecially by my mistress, who one day attempting to knock me down with a\nbesom, I knocked her down with my fist, and went back to the great\nhouse.'\n\n'And how did they receive you in the great house?'\n\n'Not very kindly, young man--on the contrary, I was put into a dark room,\nwhere I was kept a fortnight on bread and water; I did not much care,\nhowever, being glad to have got back to the great house at any rate--the\nplace where I was born, and where my poor mother died; and in the great\nhouse I continued two years longer, reading and sewing, fearing God, and\ntaking my own part when necessary.  At the end of the two years I was\nagain put out to service, but this time to a rich farmer and his wife,\nwith whom, however, I did not live long, less time, I believe, than with\nthe poor ones, being obliged to leave for--'\n\n'Knocking your mistress down?'\n\n'No, young man, knocking my master down, who conducted himself improperly\ntowards me.  This time I did not go back to the great house, having a\nmisgiving that they would not receive me; so I turned my back to the\ngreat house where I was born, and where my poor mother died, and wandered\nfor several days I know not whither, supporting myself on a few halfpence\nwhich I chanced to have in my pocket.  It happened one day, as I sat\nunder a hedge crying, having spent my last farthing, that a comfortable-\nlooking elderly woman came up in a cart, and seeing the state in which I\nwas, she stopped and asked what was the matter with me; I told her some\npart of my story, whereupon she said, 'Cheer up, my dear; if you like,\nyou shall go with me, and wait upon me.'  Of course I wanted little\npersuasion, so I got into the cart and went with her.  She took me to\nLondon and various other places, and I soon found that she was a\ntravelling woman, who went about the country with silks and linen.  I was\nof great use to her, more especially in those places where we met evil\ncompany.  Once, as we were coming from Dover, we were met by two sailors,\nwho stopped our cart, and would have robbed and stripped us.  'Let me get\ndown,' said I; so I got down, and fought with them both, till they turned\nround and ran away.  Two years I lived with the old gentlewoman, who was\nvery kind to me, almost as kind as a mother; at last she fell sick at a\nplace in Lincolnshire, and after a few days died, leaving me her cart and\nstock in trade, praying me only to see her decently buried--which I did,\ngiving her a funeral fit for a gentlewoman.  After which I travelled the\ncountry--melancholy enough for want of company, but so far fortunate,\nthat I could take my own part when anybody was uncivil to me.  At last,\npassing through the valley of Todmorden, I formed the acquaintance of\nBlazing Bosville and his wife, with whom I occasionally took journeys for\ncompany's sake, for it is melancholy to travel about alone, even when one\ncan take one's own part.  I soon found they were evil people; but, upon\nthe whole, they treated me civilly, and I sometimes lent them a little\nmoney, so that we got on tolerably well together.  He and I, it is true,\nhad once a dispute, and nearly came to blows; for once, when we were\nalone, he wanted me to marry him, promising, if I would, to turn off Grey\nMoll, or, if I liked it better, to make her wait upon me as a\nmaid-servant; I never liked him much, but from that hour less than ever.\nOf the two, I believe Grey Moll to be the best, for she is at any rate\ntrue and faithful to him, and I like truth and constancy--don't you,\nyoung man?'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'they are very nice things.  I feel very strangely.'\n\n'How do you feel, young man?\n\n'Very much afraid.'\n\n'Afraid, at what?  At the Flaming Tinman?  Don't be afraid of him.  He\nwon't come back, and if he did, he shouldn't touch you in this state, I'd\nfight him for you; but he won't come back, so you needn't be afraid of\nhim.'\n\n'I'm not afraid of the Flaming Tinman.'\n\n'What, then, are you afraid of?'\n\n'The evil one.'\n\n'The evil one!' said the girl, 'where is he?'\n\n'Coming upon me.'\n\n'Never heed,' said the girl, 'I'll stand by you.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVII\n\n\nHubbub of voices--No offence--Nodding--The guests.\n\nThe kitchen of the public-house was a large one, and many people were\ndrinking in it; there was a confused hubbub of voices.\n\nI sat down on a bench behind a deal table, of which there were three or\nfour in the kitchen; presently a bulky man, in a green coat of the\nNewmarket cut, and without a hat, entered, and observing me, came up, and\nin rather a gruff tone cried, 'Want anything, young fellow?'\n\n'Bring me a jug of ale,' said I, 'if you are the master, as I suppose you\nare, by that same coat of yours, and your having no hat on your head.'\n\n'Don't be saucy, young fellow,' said the landlord, for such he was;\n'don't be saucy, or--'  Whatever he intended to say he left unsaid, for\nfixing his eyes upon one of my hands, which I had placed by chance upon\nthe table, he became suddenly still.\n\nThis was my left hand, which was raw and swollen, from the blows dealt on\na certain hard skull in a recent combat.  'What do you mean by staring at\nmy hand so?' said I, withdrawing it from the table.\n\n'No offence, young man, no offence,' said the landlord, in a quite\naltered tone; 'but the sight of your hand--' then observing that our\nconversation began to attract the notice of the guests in the kitchen, he\ninterrupted himself, saying in an undertone, 'But mum's the word for the\npresent, I will go and fetch the ale.'\n\nIn about a minute he returned, with a jug of ale foaming high.  'Here's\nyour health,' said he, blowing off the foam, and drinking; but perceiving\nthat I looked rather dissatisfied, he murmured, 'All's right, I glory in\nyou; but mum's the word.'  Then, placing the jug on the table, he gave me\na confidential nod, and swaggered out of the room.\n\nWhat can the silly impertinent fellow mean? thought I; but the ale was\nnow before me, and I hastened to drink, for my weakness was great, and my\nmind was full of dark thoughts, the remains of the indescribable horror\nof the preceding night.  It may kill me, thought I, as I drank deep--but\nwho cares? anything is better than what I have suffered.  I drank deep,\nand then leaned back against the wall: it appeared as if a vapour was\nstealing up into my brain, gentle and benign, soothing and stifling the\nhorror and the fear; higher and higher it mounted, and I felt nearly\novercome; but the sensation was delicious, compared with that I had\nlately experienced, and now I felt myself nodding; and, bending down, I\nlaid my head on the table on my folded hands.\n\nAnd in that attitude I remained some time, perfectly unconscious.  At\nlength, by degrees, perception returned, and I lifted up my head.  I felt\nsomewhat dizzy and bewildered, but the dark shadow had withdrawn itself\nfrom me.  And now once more I drank of the jug; this second draught did\nnot produce an overpowering effect upon me--it revived and strengthened\nme--I felt a new man.\n\nI looked around me; the kitchen had been deserted by the greater part of\nthe guests; besides myself, only four remained; these were seated at the\nfarther end.  One was haranguing fiercely and eagerly; he was abusing\nEngland, and praising America.  At last he exclaimed, 'So when I gets to\nNew York, I will toss up my hat, and damn the King.'\n\nThat man must be a Radical, thought I.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII\n\n\nA Radical--Simple-looking man--Church of England--The\nPresident--Aristocracy--Gin and water--Mending the roads--Persecuting\nChurch--Simon de Montfort--Broken bells--Get up--Not for the Pope--Quay\nof New York--Mumpers' Dingle--No wish to fight--First draught--A poor\npipe--Half-a-crown broke.\n\nThe individual whom I supposed to be a Radical, after a short pause,\nagain uplifted his voice; he was rather a strong-built fellow of about\nthirty, with an ill-favoured countenance, a white hat on his head, a\nsnuff-coloured coat on his back, and when he was not speaking, a pipe in\nhis mouth.  'Who would live in such a country as England?' he shouted.\n\n'There is no country like America,' said his nearest neighbour, a man\nalso in a white hat, and of a very ill-favoured countenance--'there is no\ncountry like America,' said he, withdrawing a pipe from his mouth; 'I\nthink I shall--' and here he took a draught from a jug, the contents of\nwhich he appeared to have in common with the other,--'go to America one\nof these days myself.'\n\n'Poor old England is not such a bad country, after all,' said a third, a\nsimple-looking man in a labouring dress, who sat smoking a pipe without\nanything before him.  'If there was but a little more work to be got, I\nshould have nothing to say against her; I hope, however--'\n\n'You hope! who cares what you hope?' interrupted the first, in a savage\ntone; 'you are one of those sneaking hounds who are satisfied with dogs'\nwages--a bit of bread and a kick.  Work, indeed! who, with the spirit of\na man, would work for a country where there is neither liberty of speech\nnor of action? a land full of beggarly aristocracy, hungry\nborough-mongers, insolent parsons, and \"their . . . wives and daughters,\"\nas William Cobbett says, in his \"Register.\"'\n\n'Ah, the Church of England has been a source of incalculable mischief to\nthese realms,' said another.\n\nThe person who uttered these words sat rather aloof from the rest; he was\ndressed in a long black surtout.  I could not see much of his face,\npartly owing to his keeping it very much directed to the ground, and\npartly owing to a large slouched hat which he wore; I observed, however,\nthat his hair was of a reddish tinge.  On the table near him was a glass\nand spoon.\n\n'You are quite right,' said the first, alluding to what this last had\nsaid, 'the Church of England has done incalculable mischief here.  I\nvalue no religion three halfpence, for I believe in none; but the one\nthat I hate most is the Church of England; so when I get to New York,\nafter I have shown the fine fellows on the quay a spice of me, by . . .\nthe King, I'll toss up my hat again, and . . . the Church of England\ntoo.'\n\n'And suppose the people of New York should clap you in the stocks?' said\nI.\n\nThese words drew upon me the attention of the whole four.  The Radical\nand his companion stared at me ferociously; the man in black gave me a\npeculiar glance from under his slouched hat; the simple-looking man in\nthe labouring dress laughed.\n\n'What are you laughing at, you fool?' said the Radical, turning and\nlooking at the other, who appeared to be afraid of him; 'hold your noise;\nand a pretty fellow, you,' said he, looking at me, 'to come here, and\nspeak against the great American nation.'\n\n'I speak against the great American nation!' said I; 'I rather paid them\na compliment.'\n\n'By supposing they would put me in the stocks.  Well, I call it abusing\nthem, to suppose they would do any such thing--stocks, indeed!--there are\nno stocks in all the land.  Put me in the stocks! why, the President will\ncome down to the quay, and ask me to dinner, as soon as he hears what I\nhave said about the King and Church.'\n\n'I shouldn't wonder,' said I, 'if you go to America you will say of the\nPresident and country what now you say of the King and Church, and cry\nout for somebody to send you back to England.'\n\nThe Radical dashed his pipe to pieces against the table.  'I tell you\nwhat, young fellow, you are a spy of the aristocracy, sent here to kick\nup a disturbance.'\n\n'Kicking up a disturbance,' said I, 'is rather inconsistent with the\noffice of spy.  If I were a spy, I should hold my head down, and say\nnothing.'\n\nThe man in black partially raised his head, and gave me another peculiar\nglance.\n\n'Well, if you aren't sent to spy, you are sent to bully, to prevent\npeople speaking, and to run down the great American nation; but you\nshan't bully me.  I say, down with the aristocracy, the beggarly British\naristocracy.  Come, what have you to say to that?'\n\n'Nothing,' said I.\n\n'Nothing!' repeated the Radical.\n\n'No,' said I, 'down with them as soon as you can.'\n\n'As soon as I can!  I wish I could.  But I can down with a bully of\ntheirs.  Come, will you fight for them?'\n\n'No,' said I.\n\n'You won't?\n\n'No,' said I; 'though, from what I have seen of them, I should say they\nare tolerably able to fight for themselves.'\n\n'You won't fight for them,' said the Radical triumphantly; 'I thought so;\nall bullies, especially those of the aristocracy, are cowards.  Here,\nlandlord,' said he, raising his voice, and striking against the table\nwith the jug, 'some more ale--he won't fight for his friends.'\n\n'A white feather,' said his companion.\n\n'He! he!' tittered the man in black.\n\n'Landlord, landlord,' shouted the Radical, striking the table with the\njug louder than before.  'Who called?' said the landlord, coming in at\nlast.  'Fill this jug again,' said the other, 'and be quick about it.'\n'Does any one else want anything?' said the landlord.  'Yes,' said the\nman in black; 'you may bring me another glass of gin and water.'  'Cold?'\nsaid the landlord.  'Yes,' said the man in black, 'with a lump of sugar\nin it.'\n\n'Gin and water cold, with a lump of sugar in it,' said I, and struck the\ntable with my fist.\n\n'Take some?' said the landlord, inquiringly.\n\n'No,' said I, 'only something came into my head.'\n\n'He's mad,' said the man in black.\n\n'Not he,' said the Radical.  'He's only shamming; he knows his master is\nhere, and therefore has recourse to these manoeuvres, but it won't do.\nCome, landlord, what are you staring at?  Why don't you obey your orders?\nKeeping your customers waiting in this manner is not the way to increase\nyour business.'\n\nThe landlord looked at the Radical, and then at me.  At last, taking the\njug and glass, he left the apartment, and presently returned with each\nfilled with its respective liquor.  He placed the jug with beer before\nthe Radical, and the glass with the gin and water before the man in\nblack, and then, with a wink to me, he sauntered out.\n\n'Here is your health, sir,' said the man of the snuff-coloured coat,\naddressing himself to the one in black; 'I honour you for what you said\nabout the Church of England.  Every one who speaks against the Church of\nEngland has my warm heart.  Down with it, I say, and may the stones of it\nbe used for mending the roads, as my friend William says in his\nRegister.'\n\nThe man in black, with a courteous nod of his head, drank to the man in\nthe snuff-coloured coat.  'With respect to the steeples,' said he, 'I am\nnot altogether of your opinion; they might be turned to better account\nthan to serve to mend the roads; they might still be used as places of\nworship, but not for the worship of the Church of England.  I have no\nfault to find with the steeples, it is the Church itself which I am\ncompelled to arraign; but it will not stand long, the respectable part of\nits ministers are already leaving it.  It is a bad Church, a persecuting\nChurch.'\n\n'Whom does it persecute?' said I.\n\nThe man in black glanced at me slightly, and then replied slowly, 'The\nCatholics.'\n\n'And do those whom you call Catholics never persecute?' said I.\n\n'Never,' said the man in black.\n\n'Did you ever read Foxe's _Book of Martyrs_?' said I.\n\n'He! he!' tittered the man in black; 'there is not a word of truth in\nFoxe's _Book of Martyrs_.'\n\n'Ten times more than in the _Flos Sanctorum_,' said I.\n\nThe man in black looked at me, but made no answer.\n\n'And what say you to the Massacre of the Albigenses and the Vaudois,\n\"whose bones lie scattered on the cold Alp,\" or the Revocation of the\nEdict of Nantes?'\n\nThe man in black made no answer.\n\n'Go to,' said I; 'it is because the Church of England is not a\npersecuting church, that those whom you call the respectable part are\nleaving her; it is because they can't do with the poor Dissenters what\nSimon de Montfort did with the Albigenses, and the cruel Piedmontese with\nthe Vaudois, that they turn to bloody Rome; the Pope will no doubt\nwelcome them, for the Pope, do you see, being very much in want, will\nwelcome--'\n\n'Hollo!' said the Radical, interfering, 'what are you saying about the\nPope?  I say, hurrah for the Pope; I value no religion three halfpence,\nas I said before, but if I were to adopt any, it should be the Popish as\nit's called, because I conceives the Popish to be the grand enemy of the\nChurch of England, of the beggarly aristocracy, and the borough-monger\nsystem, so I won't hear the Pope abused while I am by.  Come, don't look\nfierce.  You won't fight, you know, I have proved it; but I will give you\nanother chance--I will fight for the Pope, will you fight against him?'\n\n'Oh dear me, yes,' said I, getting up and stepping forward.  'I am a\nquiet peaceable young man, and, being so, am always ready to fight\nagainst the Pope--the enemy of all peace and quiet; to refuse fighting\nfor the aristocracy is a widely different thing from refusing to fight\nagainst the Pope; so come on, if you are disposed to fight for him.  To\nthe Pope broken bells, to Saint James broken shells.  No Popish vile\noppression, but the Protestant succession. Confusion to the Groyne,\nhurrah for the Boyne, for the army at Clonmel, and the Protestant young\ngentlemen who live there as well.'\n\n'An Orangeman,' said the man in black.\n\n'Not a Platitude,' said I.\n\nThe man in black gave a slight start.\n\n'Amongst that family,' said I, 'no doubt, something may be done, but\namongst the Methodist preachers I should conceive that the success would\nnot be great.'\n\nThe man in black sat quite still.\n\n'Especially amongst those who have wives,' I added.\n\nThe man in black stretched his hand towards his gin and water.\n\n'However,' said I, 'we shall see what the grand movement will bring\nabout, and the results of the lessons in elocution.'\n\nThe man in black lifted the glass up to his mouth, and, in doing so, let\nthe spoon fall.\n\n'But what has this to do with the main question?' said I; 'I am waiting\nhere to fight against the Pope.'\n\n'Come, Hunter,' said the companion of the man in the snuff coloured coat,\n'get up, and fight for the Pope.'\n\n'I don't care for the young fellow,' said the man in the snuff-coloured\ncoat.\n\n'I know you don't,' said the other, 'so get up, and serve him out.'\n\n'I could serve out three like him,' said the man in the snuff-coloured\ncoat.\n\n'So much the better for you,' said the other, 'the present work will be\nall the easier for you, get up, and serve him out at once.'\n\nThe man in the snuff-coloured coat did not stir.\n\n'Who shows the white feather now?' said the simple-looking man.\n\n'He! he! he!' tittered the man in black.\n\n'Who told you to interfere?' said the Radical, turning ferociously\ntowards the simple-looking man; 'say another word and I'll--'  'And you!'\nsaid he, addressing himself to the man in black, 'a pretty fellow you to\nturn against me, after I had taken your part.  I tell you what, you may\nfight for yourself.  I'll see you and your Pope in the pit of Eldon\nbefore I fight for either of you, so make the most of it.'\n\n'Then you won't fight?' said I.\n\n'Not for the Pope,' said the Radical; 'I'll see the Pope--'\n\n'Dear me!' said I, 'not fight for the Pope, whose religion you would turn\nto, if you were inclined for any.  I see how it is, you are not fond of\nfighting; but I'll give you another chance--you were abusing the Church\nof England just now: I'll fight for it--will you fight against it?'\n\n'Come, Hunter,' said the other, 'get up, and fight against the Church of\nEngland.'\n\n'I have no particular quarrel against the Church of England,' said the\nman in the snuff-coloured coat, 'my quarrel is with the aristocracy.  If\nI said anything against the Church, it was merely for a bit of corollary,\nas Master William Cobbett would say; the quarrel with the Church belongs\nto this fellow in black, so let him carry it on.  However,' he continued\nsuddenly, 'I won't slink from the matter either; it shall never be said\nby the fine fellows on the quay of New York that I wouldn't fight against\nthe Church of England.  So down with the beggarly aristocracy, the\nChurch, and the Pope to the bottom of the pit of Eldon, and may the Pope\nfall first, and the others upon him.'\n\nThereupon, dashing his hat on the table, he placed himself in an attitude\nof offence and rushed forward.  He was, as I have said before, a powerful\nfellow, and might have proved a dangerous antagonist, more especially to\nmyself, who, after my recent encounter with the Flaming Tinman, and my\nwrestlings with the evil one, was in anything but fighting order.  Any\ncollision, however, was prevented by the landlord, who, suddenly\nappearing, thrust himself between us.  'There shall be no fighting here,'\nsaid he; 'no one shall fight in this house, except it be with myself; so\nif you two have anything to say to each other, you had better go into the\nfield behind the house.  But, you fool,' said he, pushing Hunter\nviolently on the breast, 'do you know whom you are going to tackle\nwith?--this is the young chap that beat Blazing Bosville, only as late as\nyesterday, in Mumpers' Dingle.  Grey Moll told me all about it last\nnight, when she came for some brandy for her husband, who, she said, had\nbeen half killed; and she described the young man to me so closely that I\nknew him at once, that is, as soon as I saw how his left hand was\nbruised, for she told me he was a left-hand hitter.  Aren't it all true,\nyoung man?  Aren't you he that beat Flaming Bosville, in Mumpers'\nDingle?'  'I never beat Flaming Bosville,' said I, 'he beat himself.  Had\nhe not struck his hand against a tree, I shouldn't be here at the present\nmoment.'  'Hear, hear!' said the landlord, 'now that's just as it should\nbe; I like a modest man, for, as the parson says, nothing sits better\nupon a young man than modesty.  I remember, when I was young, fighting\nwith Tom of Hopton, the best man that ever pulled off coat in England.  I\nremember, too, that I won the battle; for I happened to hit Tom of Hopton\nin the mark, as he was coming in, so that he lost his wind, and falling\nsquelch on the ground, do ye see, he lost the battle, though I am free to\nconfess that he was a better man than myself; indeed, the best man that\never fought in England; yet still, I won the battle, as every customer of\nmine, and everybody within twelve miles round, has heard over and over\nagain.  Now, Mr. Hunter, I have one thing to say, if you choose to go\ninto the field behind the house, and fight the young man, you can.  I'll\nback him for ten pounds; but no fighting in my kitchen--because why?  I\nkeeps a decent kind of an establishment.'\n\n'I have no wish to fight the young man,' said Hunter; 'more especially as\nhe has nothing to say for the aristocracy.  If he chose to fight for\nthem, indeed--but he won't, I know; for I see he's a decent, respectable\nyoung man; and, after all, fighting is a blackguard way of settling a\ndispute; so I have no wish to fight; however, there is one thing I'll\ndo,' said he, uplifting his fist, 'I'll fight this fellow in black here\nfor half a crown, or for nothing, if he pleases; it was he that got up\nthe last dispute between me and the young man, with his Pope and his\nnonsense; so I will fight him for anything he pleases, and perhaps the\nyoung man will be my second; whilst you--'\n\n'Come, Doctor,' said the landlord, 'or whatsoever you be, will you go\ninto the field with Hunter?  I'll second you, only you must back\nyourself.  I'll lay five pounds on Hunter, if you are inclined to back\nyourself; and will help you to win it as far, do you see, as a second\ncan; because why?  I always likes to do the fair thing.'\n\n'Oh, I have no wish to fight,' said the man in black, hastily; 'fighting\nis not my trade.  If I have given any offence, I beg anybody's pardon.'\n\n'Landlord,' said I, 'what have I to pay?\n\n'Nothing at all,' said the landlord; 'glad to see you.  This is the first\ntime that you have been at my house, and I never charge new customers, at\nleast customers such as you, anything for the first draught.  You'll come\nagain, I daresay; shall always be glad to see you.  I won't take it,'\nsaid he, as I put sixpence on the table; 'I won't take it.'\n\n'Yes, you shall,' said I; 'but not in payment for anything I have had\nmyself: it shall serve to pay for a jug of ale for that gentleman,' said\nI, pointing to the simple-looking individual; 'he is smoking a poor pipe.\nI do not mean to say that a pipe is a bad thing; but a pipe without ale,\ndo you see--'\n\n'Bravo!' said the landlord, 'that's just the conduct I like.'\n\n'Bravo!' said Hunter.  'I shall be happy to drink with the young man\nwhenever I meet him at New York, where, do you see, things are better\nmanaged than here.'\n\n'If I have given offence to anybody,' said the man in black, 'I repeat\nthat I ask pardon,--more especially to the young gentleman, who was\nperfectly right to stand up for his religion, just as I--not that I am of\nany particular religion, no more than this honest gentleman here,' bowing\nto Hunter; 'but I happen to know something of the Catholics--several\nexcellent friends of mine are Catholics--and of a surety the Catholic\nreligion is an ancient religion, and a widely-extended religion, though\nit certainly is not a universal religion, but it has of late made\nconsiderable progress, even amongst those nations who have been\nparticularly opposed to it--amongst the Prussians and the Dutch, for\nexample, to say nothing of the English; and then, in the East, amongst\nthe Persians, amongst the Armenians.'\n\n'The Armenians,' said I; 'oh dear me, the Armenians--'\n\n'Have you anything to say about those people, sir?' said the man in\nblack, lifting up his glass to his mouth.\n\n'I have nothing further to say,' said I, 'than that the roots of Ararat\nare occasionally found to be deeper than those of Rome.'\n\n'There's half-a-crown broke,' said the landlord, as the man in black let\nfall the glass, which was broken to pieces on the floor.  'You will pay\nme the damage, friend, before you leave this kitchen.  I like to see\npeople drink freely in my kitchen, but not too freely, and I hate\nbreakages; because why?  I keeps a decent kind of an establishment.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIX\n\n\nThe dingle--Give them ale--Not over complimentary--America--Many\npeople--Washington--Promiscuous company--Language of the roads--The old\nwomen--Numerals--The man in black.\n\nThe public-house where the scenes which I have attempted to describe in\nthe preceding chapters took place, was at the distance of about two miles\nfrom the dingle.  The sun was sinking in the west by the time I returned\nto the latter spot.  I found Belle seated by a fire, over which her\nkettle was suspended.  During my absence she had prepared herself a kind\nof tent, consisting of large hoops covered over with tarpaulins, quite\nimpenetrable to rain, however violent.  'I am glad you are returned,'\nsaid she, as soon as she perceived me; 'I began to be anxious about you.\nDid you take my advice?'\n\n'Yes,' said I; 'I went to the public-house and drank ale, as you advised\nme; it cheered, strengthened, and drove away the horror from my mind--I\nam much beholden to you.'\n\n'I knew it would do you good,' said Belle; 'I remembered that when the\npoor women in the great house were afflicted with hysterics, and fearful\nimaginings, the surgeon, who was a good kind man, used to say, \"Ale, give\nthem ale, and let it be strong.\"'\n\n'He was no advocate for tea, then?' said I.\n\n'He had no objection to tea; but he used to say, \"Everything in its\nseason.\"  Shall we take ours now?--I have waited for you.'\n\n'I have no objection,' said I; 'I feel rather heated, and at present\nshould prefer tea to ale--\"Everything in its season,\" as the surgeon\nsaid.'\n\nThereupon Belle prepared tea, and, as we were taking it, she said--'What\ndid you see and hear at the public-house?'\n\n'Really,' said I, 'you appear to have your full portion of curiosity;\nwhat matters it to you what I saw and heard at the public-house?'\n\n'It matters very little to me,' said Belle; 'I merely inquired of you,\nfor the sake of a little conversation--you were silent, and it is\nuncomfortable for two people to sit together without opening their\nlips--at least I think so.'\n\n'One only feels uncomfortable,' said I, 'in being silent, when one\nhappens to be thinking of the individual with whom one is in company.  To\ntell you the truth, I was not thinking of my companion, but of certain\ncompany with whom I had been at the public-house.'\n\n'Really, young man,' said Belle, 'you are not over complimentary; but who\nmay this wonderful company have been--some young--?' and here Belle\nstopped.\n\n'No,' said I, 'there was no young person--if person you were going to\nsay.  There was a big portly landlord, whom I daresay you have seen; a\nnoisy savage Radical, who wanted at first to fasten upon me a quarrel\nabout America, but who subsequently drew in his horns; then there was a\nstrange fellow, a prowling priest, I believe, whom I have frequently\nheard of, who at first seemed disposed to side with the Radical against\nme, and afterwards with me against the Radical.  There, you know my\ncompany, and what took place.'\n\n'Was there no one else?' said Belle.\n\n'You are mighty curious,' said I.  'No, none else, except a poor simple\nmechanic, and some common company, who soon went away.'\n\nBelle looked at me for a moment, and then appeared to be lost in\nthought--'America!' said she, musingly--'America!'\n\n'What of America?' said I.\n\n'I have heard that it is a mighty country.'\n\n'I daresay it is,' said I; 'I have heard my father say that the Americans\nare first-rate marksmen.'\n\n'I heard nothing about that,' said Belle; 'what I heard was, that it is a\ngreat and goodly land, where people can walk about without jostling, and\nwhere the industrious can always find bread; I have frequently thought of\ngoing thither.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'the Radical in the public-house will perhaps be glad of\nyour company thither; he is as great an admirer of America as yourself,\nthough I believe on different grounds.'\n\n'I shall go by myself,' said Belle, 'unless--unless that should happen\nwhich is not likely--I am not fond of Radicals no more than I am of\nscoffers and mockers.'\n\n'Do you mean to say that I am a scoffer and mocker?'\n\n'I don't wish to say you are,' said Belle; 'but some of your words sound\nstrangely like scoffing and mocking.  I have now one thing to beg, which\nis, that if you have anything to say against America, you would speak it\nout boldly.'\n\n'What should I have to say against America?  I never was there.'\n\n'Many people speak against America who never were there.'\n\n'Many people speak in praise of America who never were there; but with\nrespect to myself, I have not spoken for or against America.'\n\n'If you liked America you would speak in its praise.'\n\n'By the same rule, if I disliked America I should speak against it.'\n\n'I can't speak with you,' said Belle; 'but I see you dislike the\ncountry.'\n\n'The country!'\n\n'Well, the people--don't you?'\n\n'I do.'\n\n'Why do you dislike them?'\n\n'Why, I have heard my father say that the American marksmen, led on by a\nchap of the name of Washington, sent the English to the right-about in\ndouble-quick time.'\n\n'And that is your reason for disliking the Americans?'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'that is my reason for disliking them.'\n\n'Will you take another cup of tea?' said Belle.\n\nI took another cup; we were again silent.  'It is rather uncomfortable,'\nsaid I, at last, 'for people to sit together without having anything to\nsay.'\n\n'Were you thinking of your company?' said Belle.\n\n'What company?' said I.\n\n'The present company.'\n\n'The present company! oh, ah--I remember that I said one only feels\nuncomfortable in being silent with a companion, when one happens to be\nthinking of the companion.  Well, I had been thinking of you the last two\nor three minutes, and had just come to the conclusion that, to prevent us\nboth feeling occasionally uncomfortably towards each other, having\nnothing to say, it would be as well to have a standing subject on which\nto employ our tongues.  Belle, I have determined to give you lessons in\nArmenian.'\n\n'What is Armenian?'\n\n'Did you ever hear of Ararat?'\n\n'Yes, that was the place where the ark rested; I have heard the chaplain\nin the great house talk of it; besides, I have read of it in the Bible.'\n\n'Well, Armenian is the speech of people of that place, and I should like\nto teach it you.'\n\n'To prevent--'\n\n'Ay, ay, to prevent our occasionally feeling uncomfortable together.  Your\nacquiring it besides might prove of ulterior advantage to us both; for\nexample, suppose you and I were in promiscuous company, at Court, for\nexample, and you had something to communicate to me which you did not\nwish any one else to be acquainted with, how safely you might communicate\nit to me in Armenian.'\n\n'Would not the language of the roads do as well?' said Belle.\n\n'In some places it would,' said I, 'but not at Court, owing to its\nresemblance to thieves' slang.  There is Hebrew, again, which I was\nthinking of teaching you, till the idea of being presented at Court made\nme abandon it, from the probability of our being understood, in the event\nof our speaking it, by at least half a dozen people in our vicinity.\nThere is Latin, it is true, or Greek, which we might speak aloud at Court\nwith perfect confidence of safety, but upon the whole I should prefer\nteaching you Armenian, not because it would be a safer language to hold\ncommunication with at Court, but because, not being very well grounded in\nit myself, I am apprehensive that its words and forms may escape from my\nrecollection, unless I have sometimes occasion to call them forth.'\n\n'I am afraid we shall have to part company before I have learnt it,' said\nBelle; 'in the meantime, if I wish to say anything to you in private,\nsomebody being by, shall I speak in the language of the roads?'\n\n'If no roadster is nigh you may,' said I, 'and I will do my best to\nunderstand you.  Belle, I will now give you a lesson in Armenian.'\n\n'I suppose you mean no harm,' said Belle.\n\n'Not in the least; I merely propose the thing to prevent our occasionally\nfeeling uncomfortable together.  Let us begin.'\n\n'Stop till I have removed the tea things,' said Belle; and, getting up,\nshe removed them to her own encampment.\n\n'I am ready,' said Belle, returning, and taking her former seat, 'to join\nwith you in anything which will serve to pass away the time agreeably,\nprovided there is no harm in it.'\n\n'Belle,' said I, 'I have determined to commence the course of Armenian\nlessons by teaching you the numerals; but, before I do that, it will be\nas well to tell you that the Armenian language is called Haik.'\n\n'I am sure that word will hang upon my memory,' said Belle.\n\n'Why hang upon it?' said I.\n\n'Because the old women in the great house used to call so the chimney-\nhook, on which they hung the kettle; in like manner, on the hake of my\nmemory I will hang your hake.'\n\n'Good!' said I, 'you will make an apt scholar; but mind that I did not\nsay hake, but haik; the words are, however, very much alike; and, as you\nobserve, upon your hake you may hang my haik.  We will now proceed to the\nnumerals.'\n\n'What are numerals?' said Belle.\n\n'Numbers.  I will say the Haikan numbers up to ten.  There--have you\nheard them?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Well, try and repeat them.'\n\n'I only remember number one,' said Belle, 'and that because it is me.'\n\n' I will repeat them again,' said I, 'and pay greater attention.  Now,\ntry again.'\n\n'Me, jergo, earache.'\n\n'I neither said jergo nor earache.  I said yergou and yerek.  Belle, I am\nafraid I shall have some difficulty with you as a scholar.'\n\nBelle made no answer.  Her eyes were turned in the direction of the\nwinding path which led from the bottom of the hollow, where we were\nseated, to the plain above.  'Gorgio shunella,' she said at length, in a\nlow voice.\n\n'Pure Rommany,' said I; 'where?' I added, in a whisper.\n\n'Dovey odoi,' said Belle, nodding with her head towards the path.\n\n'I will soon see who it is,' said I; and starting up, I rushed towards\nthe pathway, intending to lay violent hands on any one I might find\nlurking in its windings.  Before, however, I had reached its\ncommencement, a man, somewhat above the middle height, advanced from it\ninto the dingle, in whom I recognised the man in black whom I had seen in\nthe public-house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XC\n\n\nBuona sera--Rather apprehensive--The steep bank--Lovely\nvirgin--Hospitality--Tory minister--Custom of the country--Sneering\nsmile--Wandering Zigan--Gypsies' cloaks--Certain faculty--Acute\nanswer--Various ways--Addio--Best Hollands.\n\nThe man in black and myself stood opposite to each other for a minute or\ntwo in silence; I will not say that we confronted each other that time,\nfor the man in black, after a furtive glance, did not look me in the\nface, but kept his eyes fixed apparently on the leaves of a bunch of\nground-nuts which were growing at my feet.  At length, looking around the\ndingle, he exclaimed, 'Buona sera, I hope I don't intrude.'\n\n'You have as much right here,' said I, 'as I or my companion; but you had\nno right to stand listening to our conversation.'\n\n'I was not listening,' said the man, 'I was hesitating whether to advance\nor retire; and if I heard some of your conversation, the fault was not\nmine.'\n\n'I do not see why you should have hesitated if your intentions were\ngood,' said I.\n\n'I think the kind of place in which I found myself might excuse some\nhesitation,' said the man in black, looking around; 'moreover, from what\nI had seen of your demeanour at the public-house, I was rather\napprehensive that the reception I might experience at your hands might be\nmore rough than agreeable.'\n\n'And what may have been your motive for coming to this place?' said I.\n\n'Per far visita a sua signoria, ecco il motivo.'\n\n'Why do you speak to me in that gibberish,' said I; 'do you think I\nunderstand it?'\n\n'It is not Armenian,' said the man in black; 'but it might serve, in a\nplace like this, for the breathing of a little secret communication, were\nany common roadster near at hand.  It would not do at Court, it is true,\nbeing the language of singing women, and the like; but we are not at\nCourt--when we are, I can perhaps summon up a little indifferent Latin,\nif I have anything private to communicate to the learned Professor.'\n\nAnd at the conclusion of this speech the man in black lifted up his head,\nand, for some moments, looked me in the face.  The muscles of his own\nseemed to be slightly convulsed, and his mouth opened in a singular\nmanner\n\n'I see,' said I, 'that for some time you were standing near me and my\ncompanion, in the mean act of listening.'\n\n'Not at all,' said the man in black; 'I heard from the steep bank above,\nthat to which I have now alluded, whilst I was puzzling myself to find\nthe path which leads to your retreat.  I made, indeed, nearly the compass\nof the whole thicket before I found it.'\n\n'And how did you know that I was here?' I demanded.\n\n'The landlord of the public-house, with whom I had some conversation\nconcerning you, informed me that he had no doubt I should find you in\nthis place, to which he gave me instructions not very clear.  But, now I\nam here, I crave permission to remain a little time, in order that I may\nhold some communion with you.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'since you are come, you are welcome; please to step this\nway.'\n\nThereupon I conducted the man in black to the fireplace, where Belle was\nstanding, who had risen from her stool on my springing up to go in quest\nof the stranger.  The man in black looked at her with evident curiosity,\nthen making her rather a graceful bow, 'Lovely virgin,' said he,\nstretching out his hand, 'allow me to salute your fingers.'\n\n'I am not in the habit of shaking hands with strangers,' said Belle.\n\n'I did not presume to request to shake hands with you,' said the man in\nblack, 'I merely wished to be permitted to salute with my lips the\nextremity of your two forefingers.'\n\n'I never permit anything of the kind,' said Belle; ' I do not approve of\nsuch unmanly ways, they are only befitting those who lurk in corners or\nbehind trees, listening to the conversation of people who would fain be\nprivate.'\n\n'Do you take me for a listener then?' said the man in black.\n\n'Ay, indeed I do,' said Belle; 'the young man may receive your excuses,\nand put confidence in them, if he please, but for my part I neither admit\nthem nor believe them;' and thereupon flinging her long hair back, which\nwas hanging over her cheeks, she seated herself on her stool.\n\n'Come, Belle,' said I, 'I have bidden the gentleman welcome, I beseech\nyou, therefore, to make him welcome; he is a stranger, where we are at\nhome, therefore, even did we wish him away, we are bound to treat him\nkindly.'\n\n'That's not English doctrine,' said the man in black.\n\n'I thought the English prided themselves on their hospitality,' said I.\n\n'They do so,' said the man in black; 'they are proud of showing\nhospitality to people above them, that is, to those who do not want it,\nbut of the hospitality which you were now describing, and which is\nArabian, they know nothing.  No Englishman will tolerate another in his\nhouse, from whom he does not expect advantage of some kind, and to those\nfrom whom he does he can be civil enough.  An Englishman thinks that,\nbecause he is in his own house, he has a right to be boorish and brutal\nto any one who is disagreeable to him, as all those are who are really in\nwant of assistance.  Should a hunted fugitive rush into an Englishman's\nhouse, beseeching protection, and appealing to the master's feelings of\nhospitality, the Englishman would knock him down in the passage.'\n\n'You are too general,' said I, 'in your strictures.  Lord ---, the\nunpopular Tory minister, was once chased through the streets of London by\na mob, and, being in danger of his life, took shelter in the shop of a\nWhig linen-draper, declaring his own unpopular name, and appealing to the\nlinen-draper's feelings of hospitality; whereupon the linen-draper,\nutterly forgetful of all party rancour, nobly responded to the appeal,\nand telling his wife to conduct his lordship upstairs, jumped over the\ncounter, with his ell in his hand, and placing himself with half-a-dozen\nof his assistants at the door of his boutique, manfully confronted the\nmob, telling them that he would allow himself to be torn to a thousand\npieces ere he would permit them to injure a hair of his lordship's head:\nwhat do you think of that?'\n\n'He! he! he!' tittered the man in black.\n\n'Well,' said I, 'I am afraid your own practice is not very different from\nthat which you have been just now describing; you sided with the Radical\nin the public-house against me, as long as you thought him the most\npowerful, and then turned against him when you saw he was cowed.  What\nhave you to say to that?'\n\n'Oh, when one is in Rome, I mean England, one must do as they do in\nEngland; I was merely conforming to the custom of the country, he! he!\nbut I beg your pardon here, as I did in the public-house.  I made a\nmistake.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'we will drop the matter, but pray seat yourself on that\nstone, and I will sit down on the grass near you.'\n\nThe man in black, after proffering two or three excuses for occupying\nwhat he supposed to be my seat, sat down upon the stone, and I squatted\ndown, gypsy-fashion, just opposite to him, Belle sitting on her stool at\na slight distance on my right.  After a time I addressed him thus: 'Am I\nto reckon this a mere visit of ceremony? should it prove so, it will be,\nI believe, the first visit of the kind ever paid me.'\n\n'Will you permit me to ask,' said the man in black--'the weather is very\nwarm,' said he, interrupting himself, and taking off his hat.\n\nI now observed that he was partly bald, his red hair having died away\nfrom the fore part of his crown--his forehead was high, his eyebrows\nscanty, his eyes gray and sly, with a downward tendency, his nose was\nslightly aquiline, his mouth rather large--a kind of sneering smile\nplayed continually on his lips, his complexion was somewhat rubicund.\n\n'A bad countenance,' said Belle, in the language of the roads, observing\nthat my eyes were fixed on his face.\n\n'Does not my countenance please you, fair damsel?' said the man in black,\nresuming his hat, and speaking in a peculiarly gentle voice.\n\n'How,' said I, 'do you understand the language of the roads?'\n\n'As little as I do Armenian,' said the man in black; 'but I understand\nlook and tone.'\n\n'So do I, perhaps,' retorted Belle; 'and, to tell you the truth, I like\nyour tone as little as your face.'\n\n'For shame,' said I; 'have you forgot what I was saying just now about\nthe duties of hospitality?  You have not yet answered my question,' said\nI, addressing myself to the man, 'with respect to your visit.'\n\n'Will you permit me to ask who you are?'\n\n'Do you see the place where I live?' said I.\n\n'I do,' said the man in black, looking around.\n\n'Do you know the name of this place?'\n\n'I was told it was Mumpers' or Gypsies' Dingle,' said the man in black.\n\n'Good,' said I; 'and this forge and tent, what do they look like?'\n\n'Like the forge and tent of a wandering Zigan; I have seen the like in\nItaly.'\n\n'Good,' said I; 'they belong to me.'\n\n'Are you, then, a gypsy?' said the man in black.\n\n'What else should I be?'\n\n'But you seem to have been acquainted with various individuals with whom\nI have likewise had acquaintance; and you have even alluded to matters,\nand even words, which have passed between me and them.'\n\n'Do you know how gypsies live?' said I.\n\n'By hammering old iron, I believe, and telling fortunes.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'there's my forge, and yonder is some iron, though not\nold, and by your own confession I am a soothsayer.'\n\n'But how did you come by your knowledge?'\n\n'Oh,' said I, 'if you want me to reveal the secrets of my trade, I have,\nof course, nothing further to say.  Go to the scarlet dyer, and ask him\nhow he dyes cloth.'\n\n'Why scarlet?' said the man in black.  'Is it because gypsies blush like\nscarlet?'\n\n'Gypsies never blush,' said I; 'but gypsies' cloaks are scarlet.'\n\n'I should almost take you for a gypsy,' said the man in black, 'but for--'\n\n'For what?' said I.\n\n'But for that same lesson in Armenian, and your general knowledge of\nlanguages; as for your manners and appearance I will say nothing,' said\nthe man in black, with a titter.\n\n'And why should not a gypsy possess a knowledge of languages?' said I.\n\n'Because the gypsy race is perfectly illiterate,' said the man in black;\n'they are possessed, it is true, of a knavish acuteness, and are\nparticularly noted for giving subtle and evasive answers--and in your\nanswers, I confess, you remind me of them; but that one of the race\nshould acquire a learned language like the Armenian, and have a general\nknowledge of literature, is a thing che io non credo afatto.'\n\n'What do you take me for?' said I.\n\n'Why,' said the man in black, 'I should consider you to be a philologist,\nwho, for some purpose, has taken up a gypsy life; but I confess to you\nthat your way of answering questions is far too acute for a philologist.'\n\n'And why should not a philologist be able to answer questions acutely?'\nsaid I.\n\n'Because the philological race is the most stupid under heaven,' said the\nman in black; 'they are possessed, it is true, of a certain faculty for\npicking up words, and a memory for retaining them; but that any one of\nthe sect should be able to give a rational answer, to say nothing of an\nacute one, on any subject--even though the subject were philology--is a\nthing of which I have no idea.'\n\n'But you found me giving a lesson in Armenian to this handmaid?'\n\n'I believe I did,' said the man in black.\n\n'And you heard me give what you are disposed to call acute answers to the\nquestions you asked me?'\n\n'I believe I did,' said the man in black.\n\n'And would any one but a philologist think of giving a lesson in Armenian\nto a handmaid in a dingle?\n\n'I should think not,' said the man in black.\n\n'Well, then, don't you see that it is possible for a philologist to give\nnot only a rational, but an acute answer?'\n\n'I really don't know,' said the man in black.\n\n'What's the matter with you?' said I.\n\n'Merely puzzled,' said the man in black.\n\n'Puzzled?\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Really puzzled?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Remain so.'\n\n'Well,' said the man in black, rising, 'puzzled or not, I will no longer\ntrespass upon your and this young lady's retirement; only allow me,\nbefore I go, to apologise for my intrusion.'\n\n'No apology is necessary,' said I; 'will you please to take anything\nbefore you go?  I think this young lady, at my request, would contrive to\nmake you a cup of tea.'\n\n'Tea!' said the man in black; 'he! he!  I don't drink tea; I don't like\nit--if, indeed, you had,' and here he stopped.\n\n'There's nothing like gin and water, is there?' said I, 'but I am sorry\nto say I have none.'\n\n'Gin and water,' said the man in black, 'how do you know that I am fond\nof gin and water?'\n\n'Did I not see you drinking some at the public-house?'\n\n'You did,' said the man in black, 'and I remember that, when I called for\nsome you repeated my words--permit me to ask, is gin and water an unusual\ndrink in England?'\n\n'It is not usually drunk cold, and with a lump of sugar,' said I.\n\n'And did you know who I was by my calling for it so?'\n\n'Gypsies have various ways of obtaining information,' said I.\n\n'With all your knowledge,' said the man in black, 'you do not appear to\nhave known that I was coming to visit you?'\n\n'Gypsies do not pretend to know anything which relates to themselves,'\nsaid I; 'but I advise you, if you ever come again, to come openly.'\n\n'Have I your permission to come again?' said the man in black.\n\n'Come when you please; this dingle is as free for you as me.'\n\n'I will visit you again,' said the man in black--'till then, addio.'\n\n'Belle,' said I, after the man in black had departed, 'we did not treat\nthat man very hospitably; he left us without having eaten or drunk at our\nexpense.'\n\n'You offered him some tea,' said Belle, 'which, as it is mine, I should\nhave grudged him, for I like him not.'\n\n'Our liking or disliking him had nothing to do with the matter, he was\nour visitor, and ought not to have been permitted to depart dry; living\nas we do in this desert, we ought always to be prepared to administer to\nthe wants of our visitors.  Belle, do you know where to procure any good\nHollands?'\n\n'I think I do,' said Belle, 'but--'\n\n'I will have no buts.  Belle, I expect that with as little delay as\npossible you procure, at my expense, the best Hollands you can find.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCI\n\n\nExcursions--Adventurous English--Opaque forests--The greatest patience.\n\nTime passed on, and Belle and I lived in the dingle; when I say lived,\nthe reader must not imagine that we were always there.  She went out upon\nher pursuits, and I went out where inclination led me; but my excursions\nwere very short ones, and hers occasionally occupied whole days and\nnights.  If I am asked how we passed the time when we were together in\nthe dingle, I would answer that we passed the time very tolerably, all\nthings considered; we conversed together, and when tired of conversing I\nwould sometimes give Belle a lesson in Armenian; her progress was not\nparticularly brilliant, but upon the whole satisfactory; in about a\nfortnight she had hung up one hundred Haikan numerals upon the hake of\nher memory.  I found her conversation highly entertaining; she had seen\nmuch of England and Wales, and had been acquainted with some of the most\nremarkable characters who travelled the roads at that period; and let me\nbe permitted to say that many remarkable characters have travelled the\nroads of England, of whom fame has never said a word.  I loved to hear\nher anecdotes of these people; some of whom I found had occasionally\nattempted to lay violent hands either upon her person or effects, and had\ninvariably been humbled by her without the assistance of either justice\nor constable.  I could clearly see, however, that she was rather tired of\nEngland, and wished for a change of scene; she was particularly fond of\ntalking of America, to which country her aspirations chiefly tended.  She\nhad heard much of America, which had excited her imagination; for at that\ntime America was much talked of, on roads and in homesteads--at least, so\nsaid Belle, who had good opportunities of knowing--and most people\nallowed that it was a good country for adventurous English.  The people\nwho chiefly spoke against it, as she informed me, were soldiers disbanded\nupon pensions, the sextons of village churches, and excisemen.  Belle had\na craving desire to visit that country, and to wander with cart and\nlittle animal amongst its forests; when I would occasionally object that\nshe would be exposed to danger from strange and perverse customers, she\nsaid that she had not wandered the roads of England so long and alone, to\nbe afraid of anything which might befall in America; and that she hoped,\nwith God's favour, to be able to take her own part, and to give to\nperverse customers as good as they might bring.  She had a dauntless\nheart, that same Belle.  Such was the staple of Belle's conversation.  As\nfor mine, I would endeavour to entertain her with strange dreams of\nadventure, in which I figured in opaque forests, strangling wild beasts,\nor discovering and plundering the hoards of dragons; and sometimes I\nwould narrate to her other things far more genuine--how I had tamed\nsavage mares, wrestled with Satan, and had dealings with ferocious\npublishers.  Belle had a kind heart, and would weep at the accounts I\ngave her of my early wrestlings with the dark Monarch.  She would sigh,\ntoo, as I recounted the many slights and degradations I had received at\nthe hands of ferocious publishers; but she had the curiosity of a woman;\nand once, when I talked to her of the triumphs which I had achieved over\nunbroken mares, she lifted up her head and questioned me as to the secret\nof the virtue which I possessed over the aforesaid animals; whereupon I\nsternly reprimanded, and forthwith commanded her to repeat the Armenian\nnumerals; and, on her demurring, I made use of words, to escape which she\nwas glad to comply, saying the Armenian numerals from one to a hundred,\nwhich numerals, as a punishment for her curiosity, I made her repeat\nthree times, loading her with the bitterest reproaches whenever she\ncommitted the slightest error, either in accent or pronunciation, which\nreproaches she appeared to bear with the greatest patience.  And now I\nhave given a very fair account of the manner in which Isopel Berners and\nmyself passed our time in the dingle.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCII\n\n\nThe landlord--Rather too old--Without a shilling--Reputation--A fortnight\nago--Liquids--The main chance--Respectability--Irrational\nbeings--Parliament cove--My brewer.\n\nAmongst other excursions, I went several times to the public-house to\nwhich I introduced the reader in a former chapter.  I had experienced\nsuch beneficial effects from the ale I had drunk on that occasion, that I\nwished to put its virtue to a frequent test; nor did the ale on\nsubsequent trials belie the good opinion which I had at first formed of\nit.  After each visit which I made to the public-house, I found my frame\nstronger and my mind more cheerful than they had previously been.  The\nlandlord appeared at all times glad to see me, and insisted that I should\nsit within the bar, where, leaving his other guests to be attended to by\na niece of his, who officiated as his housekeeper, he would sit beside me\nand talk of matters concerning 'the ring,' indulging himself with a cigar\nand a glass of sherry, which he told me was his favourite wine, whilst I\ndrank my ale.  'I loves the conversation of all you coves of the ring,'\nsaid he once, 'which is natural, seeing as how I have fought in a ring\nmyself.  Ah, there is nothing like the ring; I wish I was not rather too\nold to go again into it.  I often think I should like to have another\nrally--one more rally, and then--but there's a time for all things--youth\nwill be served, every dog has his day, and mine has been a fine one--let\nme be content.  After beating Tom of Hopton, there was not much more to\nbe done in the way of reputation; I have long sat in my bar the wonder\nand glory of this here neighbourhood.  I'm content, as far as reputation\ngoes; I only wish money would come in a little faster; however, the next\nmain of cocks will bring me in something handsome--comes off next\nWednesday, at ---; have ventured ten five-pound notes--shouldn't say\nventured either--run no risk at all, because why?  I knows my birds.'\nAbout ten days after this harangue I called again, at about three o'clock\none afternoon.  The landlord was seated on a bench by a table in the\ncommon room, which was entirely empty; he was neither smoking nor\ndrinking, but sat with his arms folded, and his head hanging down over\nhis breast.  At the sound of my step he looked up; 'Ah,' said he, 'I am\nglad you are come, I was just thinking about you.'  'Thank you,' said I;\n'it was very kind of you, especially at a time like this, when your mind\nmust be full of your good fortune.  Allow me to congratulate you on the\nsums of money you won by the main of cocks at ---.  I hope you brought it\nall safe home.'  'Safe home!' said the landlord; 'I brought myself safe\nhome, and that was all; came home without a shilling, regularly done,\ncleaned out.'  'I am sorry for that,' said I; 'but after you had won the\nmoney, you ought to have been satisfied, and not risked it again--how did\nyou lose it?  I hope not by the pea and thimble.'  'Pea and thimble,'\nsaid the landlord--'not I; those confounded cocks left me nothing to lose\nby the pea and thimble.'  'Dear me,' said I; 'I thought that you knew\nyour birds.'  'Well, so I did,' said the landlord; 'I knew the birds to\nbe good birds, and so they proved, and would have won if better birds had\nnot been brought against them, of which I knew nothing, and so do you see\nI am done, regularly done.'  'Well,' said I, 'don't be cast down; there\nis one thing of which the cocks by their misfortune cannot deprive\nyou--your reputation; make the most of that, give up cock-fighting, and\nbe content with the custom of your house, of which you will always have\nplenty, as long as you are the wonder and glory of the neighbourhood.'\n\nThe landlord struck the table before him violently with his fist.\n'Confound my reputation!' said he.  'No reputation that I have will be\nsatisfaction to my brewer for the seventy pounds I owe him.  Reputation\nwon't pass for the current coin of this here realm; and let me tell you,\nthat if it ain't backed by some of it, it ain't a bit better than rotten\ncabbage, as I have found.  Only three weeks since I was, as I told you,\nthe wonder and glory of the neighbourhood; and people used to come to\nlook at me, and worship me; but as soon as it began to be whispered about\nthat I owed money to the brewer, they presently left off all that kind of\nthing; and now, during the last three days, since the tale of my\nmisfortune with the cocks has got wind, almost everybody has left off\ncoming to the house, and the few who does, merely comes to insult and\nflout me.  It was only last night that fellow, Hunter, called me an old\nfool in my own kitchen here.  He wouldn't have called me a fool a\nfortnight ago; 'twas I called him fool then, and last night he called me\nold fool; what do you think of that?--the man that beat Tom of Hopton, to\nbe called, not only a fool, but an old fool; and I hadn't heart, with one\nblow of this here fist into his face, to send his head ringing against\nthe wall; for when a man's pocket is low, do you see, his heart ain't\nmuch higher; but it is of no use talking, something must be done.  I was\nthinking of you just as you came in, for you are just the person that can\nhelp me.'\n\n'If you mean,' said I, 'to ask me to lend you the money which you want,\nit will be to no purpose, as I have very little of my own, just enough\nfor my own occasions; it is true, if you desired it, I would be your\nintercessor with the person to whom you owe the money, though I should\nhardly imagine that anything I could say--'  'You are right there,' said\nthe landlord; 'much the brewer would care for anything you could say on\nmy behalf--your going would be the very way to do me up entirely.  A\npretty opinion he would have of the state of my affairs if I were to send\nhim such a 'cessor as you; and as for your lending me money, don't think\nI was ever fool enough to suppose either that you had any, or if you had\nthat you would be fool enough to lend me any.  No, no, the coves of the\nring knows better; I have been in the ring myself, and knows what a\nfighting cove is, and though I was fool enough to back those birds, I was\nnever quite fool enough to lend anybody money.  What I am about to\npropose is something very different from going to my landlord, or lending\nany capital; something which, though it will put money into my pocket,\nwill likewise put something handsome into your own.  I want to get up a\nfight in this here neighbourhood, which would be sure to bring plenty of\npeople to my house, for a week before and after it takes place; and as\npeople can't come without drinking, I think I could, during one\nfortnight, get off for the brewer all the sour and unsaleable liquids he\nnow has, which people wouldn't drink at any other time, and by that\nmeans, do you see, liquidate my debt; then, by means of betting, making\nfirst all right, do you see, I have no doubt that I could put something\nhandsome into my pocket and yours, for I should wish you to be the\nfighting man, as I think I can depend upon you.'  'You really must excuse\nme,' said I; 'I have no wish to figure as a pugilist; besides, there is\nsuch a difference in our ages; you may be the stronger man of the two,\nand perhaps the hardest hitter, but I am in much better condition, am\nmore active on my legs, so that I am almost sure I should have the\nadvantage, for, as you very properly observed, \"Youth will be served.\"'\n'Oh, I didn't mean to fight,' said the landlord; 'I think I could beat\nyou if I were to train a little; but in the fight I propose I looks more\nto the main chance than anything else.  I question whether half so many\npeople could be brought together if you were to fight with me as the\nperson I have in view, or whether there would be half such opportunities\nfor betting, for I am a man, do you see; the person I wants you to fight\nwith is not a man, but the young woman you keeps company with.'\n\n'The young woman I keep company with,' said I; 'pray what do you mean?'\n\n'We will go into the bar, and have something,' said the landlord, getting\nup.  'My niece is out, and there is no one in the house, so we can talk\nthe matter over quietly.'  Thereupon I followed him into the bar, where,\nhaving drawn me a jug of ale, helped himself as usual to a glass of\nsherry, and lighted a cigar, he proceeded to explain himself further.\n'What I wants is to get up a fight between a man and a woman; there never\nhas yet been such a thing in the ring, and the mere noise of the matter\nwould bring thousands of people together, quite enough to drink out, for\nthe thing should be close to my house, all the brewer's stock of liquids,\nboth good and bad.'  'But,' said I, 'you were the other day boasting of\nthe respectability of your house; do you think that a fight between a man\nand a woman close to your establishment would add to its respectability?'\n'Confound the respectability of my house,' said the landlord; 'will the\nrespectability of my house pay the brewer, or keep the roof over my head?\nNo, no! when respectability won't keep a man, do you see, the best thing\nis to let it go and wander.  Only let me have my own way, and both the\nbrewer, myself, and every one of us, will be satisfied.  And then the\nbetting--what a deal we may make by the betting--and that we shall have\nall to ourselves, you, I, and the young woman; the brewer will have no\nhand in that.  I can manage to raise ten pounds, and if by flashing that\nabout I don't manage to make a hundred, call me horse.'  'But suppose,'\nsaid I, 'the party should lose, on whom you sport your money, even as the\nbirds did?'  'We must first make all right,' said the landlord, 'as I\ntold you before; the birds were irrational beings, and therefore couldn't\ncome to an understanding with the others, as you and the young woman can.\nThe birds fought fair; but I intend that you and the young woman should\nfight cross.'  'What do you mean by cross?' said I.  'Come, come,' said\nthe landlord, 'don't attempt to gammon me; you in the ring, and pretend\nnot to know what fighting cross is!  That won't do, my fine fellow; but\nas no one is near us, I will speak out.  I intend that you and the young\nwoman should understand one another, and agree beforehand which should be\nbeat; and if you take my advice, you will determine between you that the\nyoung woman shall be beat, as I am sure that the odds will run high upon\nher, her character as a fist-woman being spread far and wide, so that all\nthe flats who think it will be all right will back her, as I myself\nwould, if I thought it would be a fair thing.'  'Then,' said I, 'you\nwould not have us fight fair?'  'By no means,' said the landlord,\n'because why?--I conceives that a cross is a certainty to those who are\nin it, whereas by the fair thing one may lose all he has.'  'But,' said\nI, 'you said the other day that you liked the fair thing.'  'That was by\nway of gammon,' said the landlord; 'just, do you see, as a Parliament\ncove might say, speechifying from a barrel to a set of flats, whom he\nmeans to sell.  Come, what do you think of the plan?'\n\n'It is a very ingenious one,' said I.\n\n'Ain't it?' said the landlord.  'The folks in this neighbourhood are\nbeginning to call me old fool; but if they don't call me something else,\nwhen they sees me friends with the brewer, and money in my pocket, my\nname is not Catchpole.  Come, drink your ale, and go home to the young\ngentlewoman.'\n\n'I am going,' said I, rising from my seat, after finishing the remainder\nof the ale.\n\n'Do you think she'll have any objection?' said the landlord.\n\n'To do what?' said I.\n\n'Why, to fight cross.'\n\n'Yes, I do,' said I.\n\n'But you will do your best to persuade her?'\n\n'No, I will not,' said I.\n\n'Are you fool enough to wish to fight fair?'\n\n'No,' said I, 'I am wise enough to wish not to fight at all.'\n\n'And how's my brewer to be paid?' said the landlord.\n\n'I really don't know,' said I.\n\n'I'll change my religion,' said the landlord.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIII\n\n\nAnother visit--A la Margutte--Clever man--Napoleon's estimate--Another\nstatue.\n\nOne evening Belle and myself received another visit from the man in\nblack.  After a little conversation of not much importance, I asked him\nwhether he would not take some refreshment, assuring him that I was now\nin possession of some very excellent Hollands, which, with a glass, a jug\nof water, and a lump of sugar, was heartily at his service; he accepted\nmy offer, and Belle going with a jug to the spring, from which she was in\nthe habit of procuring water for tea, speedily returned with it full of\nthe clear, delicious water of which I have already spoken.  Having placed\nthe jug by the side of the man in black, she brought him a glass and\nspoon, and a tea-cup, the latter containing various lumps of snowy-white\nsugar: in the meantime I had produced a bottle of the stronger liquid.\nThe man in black helped himself to some water, and likewise to some\nHollands, the proportion of water being about two-thirds; then adding a\nlump of sugar, he stirred the whole up, tasted it, and said that it was\ngood.\n\n'This is one of the good things of life,' he added, after a short pause.\n\n'What are the others?' I demanded.\n\n'There is Malvoisia sack,' said the man in black, 'and partridge, and\nbeccafico.'\n\n'And what do you say to high mass?' said I.\n\n'High mass!' said the man in black; 'however,' he continued, after a\npause, 'I will be frank with you; I came to be so; I may have heard high\nmass on a time, and said it too; but as for any predilection for it, I\nassure you I have no more than for a long High Church sermon.'\n\n'You speak a la Margutte,' said I.\n\n'Margutte!' said the man in black, musingly, 'Margutte!'\n\n'You have read Pulci, I suppose?' said I.\n\n'Yes, yes,' said the man in black, laughing; 'I remember.'\n\n'He might be rendered into English,' said I, 'something in this style:\n\n   'To which Margutte answered with a sneer,\n   I like the blue no better than the black,\n   My faith consists alone in savoury cheer,\n   In roasted capons, and in potent sack;\n   But above all, in famous gin and clear,\n   Which often lays the Briton on his back;\n   With lump of sugar, and with lymph from well,\n   I drink it, and defy the fiends of hell.'\n\n'He! he! he!' said the man in black; 'that is more than Mezzofante could\nhave done for a stanza of Byron.'\n\n'A clever man,' said I.\n\n'Who?' said the man in black.\n\n'Mezzofante di Bologna.'\n\n'He! he! he!' said the man in black; 'now I know that you are not a\ngypsy, at least a soothsayer; no soothsayer would have said that--'\n\n'Why,' said I, 'does he not understand five-and-twenty tongues?'\n\n'Oh yes,' said the man in black; 'and five-and-twenty added to them; but,\nhe! he! he! it was principally from him, who is certainly the greatest of\nPhilologists, that I formed my opinion of the sect.'\n\n'You ought to speak of him with more respect,' said I; 'I have heard say\nthat he has done good service to your See.'\n\n'Oh yes,' said the man in black; 'he has done good service to our See,\nthat is, in his way; when the neophytes of the Propaganda are to be\nexamined in the several tongues in which they are destined to preach, he\nis appointed to question them, the questions being first written down for\nhim, or else, he! he! he!--Of course you know Napoleon's estimate of\nMezzofante; he sent for the linguist from motives of curiosity, and after\nsome discourse with him, told him that he might depart; then turning to\nsome of his generals he observed, \"Nous avons eu ici un exemple qu'un\nhomme peut avoir beaucoup de paroles avec bien pen d'esprit.\"'\n\n'You are ungrateful to him,' said I; 'well, perhaps, when he is dead and\ngone you will do him justice.'\n\n'True,' said the man in black; 'when he is dead and gone, we intend to\nerect him a statue of wood, on the left-hand side of the door of the\nVatican library.'\n\n'Of wood?' said I.\n\n'He was the son of a carpenter, you know,' said the man in black; 'the\nfigure will be of wood for no other reason, I assure you; he! he!'\n\n'You should place another statue on the right.'\n\n'Perhaps we shall,' said the man in black; 'but we know of no one amongst\nthe philologists of Italy, nor, indeed, of the other countries inhabited\nby the faithful, worthy to sit parallel in effigy with our illustrissimo;\nwhen, indeed, we have conquered these regions of the perfidious by\nbringing the inhabitants thereof to the true faith, I have no doubt that\nwe shall be able to select one worthy to bear him company--one whose\nstatue shall be placed on the right hand of the library, in testimony of\nour joy at his conversion; for, as you know, \"There is more joy,\" etc.'\n\n'Wood?' said I.\n\n'I hope not,' said the man in black; 'no, if I be consulted as to the\nmaterial for the statue, I should strongly recommend bronze.'\n\nAnd when the man in black had said this, he emptied his second tumbler of\nits contents, and prepared himself another.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIV\n\n\nPrerogative--Feeling of gratitude--A long history--Alliterative\nstyle--Advantageous specimen--Jesuit benefice--Not sufficient--Queen\nStork's tragedy--Good sense--Grandeur and gentility--Ironmonger's\ndaughter--Clan Mac-Sycophant--Lickspittles--A curiosity--Newspaper\neditors--Charles the Simple--High-flying ditty--Dissenters--Lower\nclasses--Priestley's house--Saxon ancestors--Austin--Renovating\nglass--Money--Quite original.\n\n'So you hope to bring these regions again beneath the banner of the Roman\nSee?' said I, after the man in black had prepared the beverage, and\ntasted it.\n\n'Hope!' said the man in black; 'how can we fail?  Is not the Church of\nthese regions going to lose its prerogative?'\n\n'Its prerogative?'\n\n'Yes; those who should be the guardians of the religion of England are\nabout to grant Papists emancipation, and to remove the disabilities from\nDissenters, which will allow the Holy Father to play his own game in\nEngland.'\n\nOn my inquiring how the Holy Father intended to play his game, the man in\nblack gave me to understand that he intended for the present to cover the\nland with temples, in which the religion of Protestants would be\ncontinually scoffed at and reviled.\n\nOn my observing that such behaviour would savour strongly of ingratitude,\nthe man in black gave me to understand that if I entertained the idea\nthat the See of Rome was ever influenced in its actions by any feeling of\ngratitude I was much mistaken, assuring me that if the See of Rome in any\nencounter should chance to be disarmed, and its adversary, from a feeling\nof magnanimity, should restore the sword which had been knocked out of\nits hand, the See of Rome always endeavoured on the first opportunity to\nplunge the said sword into its adversary's bosom; conduct which the man\nin black seemed to think was very wise, and which he assured me had\nalready enabled it to get rid of a great many troublesome adversaries,\nand would, he had no doubt, enable it to get rid of a great many more.\n\nOn my attempting to argue against the propriety of such behaviour, the\nman in black cut the matter short by saying that if one party was a fool\nhe saw no reason why the other should imitate it in its folly.\n\nAfter musing a little while, I told him that emancipation had not yet\npassed through the legislature, and that perhaps it never would;\nreminding him that there was often many a slip between the cup and the\nlip; to which observation the man in black agreed, assuring me, however,\nthat there was no doubt that emancipation would be carried, inasmuch as\nthere was a very loud cry at present in the land--a cry of 'tolerance,'\nwhich had almost frightened the Government out of its wits; who, to get\nrid of the cry, was going to grant all that was asked in the way of\ntoleration, instead of telling the people to 'hold their nonsense,' and\ncutting them down provided they continued bawling longer.\n\nI questioned the man in black with respect to the origin of this cry; but\nhe said, to trace it to its origin would require a long history; that, at\nany rate, such a cry was in existence, the chief raisers of it being\ncertain of the nobility, called Whigs, who hoped by means of it to get\ninto power, and to turn out certain ancient adversaries of theirs called\nTories, who were for letting things remain _in statu quo_; that these\nWhigs were backed by a party amongst the people called Radicals, a\nspecimen of whom I had seen in the public-house; a set of fellows who\nwere always in the habit of bawling against those in place; 'and so,' he\nadded, 'by means of these parties, and the hubbub which the Papists and\nother smaller sects are making, a general emancipation will be carried,\nand the Church of England humbled, which is the principal thing which the\nSee of Rome cares for.'\n\nOn my telling the man in black that I believed that, even among the high\ndignitaries of the English Church, there were many who wished to grant\nperfect freedom to religions of all descriptions, he said he was aware\nthat such was the fact, and that such a wish was anything but wise,\ninasmuch as, if they had any regard for the religion they professed, they\nought to stand by it through thick and thin, proclaiming it to be the\nonly true one, and denouncing all others, in an alliterative style, as\ndangerous and damnable; whereas, by their present conduct, they were\nbringing their religion into contempt with the people at large, who would\nnever continue long attached to a Church the ministers of which did not\nstand up for it, and likewise cause their own brethren, who had a clearer\nnotion of things, to be ashamed of belonging to it.  'I speak advisedly,'\nsaid he, in continuation; 'there is one Platitude.'\n\n'And I hope there is only one,' said I; 'you surely would not adduce the\nlikes and dislikes of that poor silly fellow as the criterions of the\nopinions of any party?'\n\n'You know him,' said the man in black, 'nay, I heard you mention him in\nthe public-house; the fellow is not very wise, I admit, but he has sense\nenough to know that, unless a Church can make people hold their tongues\nwhen it thinks fit, it is scarcely deserving the name of a Church; no, I\nthink that the fellow is not such a very bad stick, and that upon the\nwhole he is, or rather was, an advantageous specimen of the High Church\nEnglish clergy, who, for the most part, so far from troubling their heads\nabout persecuting people, only think of securing their tithes, eating\ntheir heavy dinners, puffing out their cheeks with importance on country\njustice benches, and occasionally exhibiting their conceited wives,\nhoyden daughters, and gawky sons at country balls, whereas Platitude--'\n\n'Stop,' said I; 'you said in the public-house that the Church of England\nwas a persecuting Church, and here in the dingle you have confessed that\none section of it is willing to grant perfect freedom to the exercise of\nall religions, and the other only thinks of leading an easy life.'\n\n'Saying a thing in the public-house is a widely different thing from\nsaying it in the dingle,' said the man in black; 'had the Church of\nEngland been a persecuting Church, it would not stand in the position in\nwhich it stands at present; it might, with its opportunities, have spread\nitself over the greater part of the world.  I was about to observe that,\ninstead of practising the indolent habits of his High Church brethren,\nPlatitude would be working for his money, preaching the proper use of\nfire and faggot, or rather of the halter and the whipping-post,\nencouraging mobs to attack the houses of Dissenters, employing spies to\ncollect the scandal of neighbourhoods, in order that he might use it for\nsacerdotal purposes, and, in fact, endeavouring to turn an English parish\ninto something like a Jesuit benefice in the south of France.'\n\n'He tried that game,' said I, 'and the parish said \"Pooh, pooh,\" and, for\nthe most part, went over to the Dissenters.'\n\n'Very true,' said the man in black, taking a sip at his glass, 'but why\nwere the Dissenters allowed to preach? why were they not beaten on the\nlips till they spat out blood, with a dislodged tooth or two?  Why, but\nbecause the authority of the Church of England has, by its own fault,\nbecome so circumscribed that Mr. Platitude was not able to send a host of\nbeadles and sbirri to their chapel to bring them to reason, on which\naccount Mr. Platitude is very properly ashamed of his Church, and is\nthinking of uniting himself with one which possesses more vigour and\nauthority.'\n\n'It may have vigour and authority,' said I, 'in foreign lands, but in\nthese kingdoms the day for practising its atrocities is gone by.  It is\nat present almost below contempt, and is obliged to sue for grace _in\nforma pauperis_.'\n\n'Very true,' said the man in black; 'but let it once obtain emancipation,\nand it will cast its slough, put on its fine clothes, and make converts\nby thousands.  'What a fine Church!' they'll say; 'with what authority it\nspeaks! no doubts, no hesitation, no sticking at trifles.  What a\ncontrast to the sleepy English Church!  They'll go over to it by\nmillions, till it preponderates here over every other, when it will of\ncourse be voted the dominant one; and then--and then--' and here the man\nin black drank a considerable quantity of gin and water.\n\n'What then?' said I.\n\n'What then?' said the man in black, 'why she will be true to herself.  Let\nDissenters, whether they be Church of England, as perhaps they may still\ncall themselves, Methodist, or Presbyterian, presume to grumble, and\nthere shall be bruising of lips in pulpits, tying up to whipping-posts,\ncutting off ears and noses--he! he! the farce of King Log has been acted\nlong enough; the time for Queen Stork's tragedy is drawing nigh'; and the\nman in black sipped his gin and water in a very exulting manner.\n\n'And this is the Church which, according to your assertion in the public-\nhouse, never persecutes?'\n\n'I have already given you an answer,' said the man in black.  'With\nrespect to the matter of the public-house, it is one of the happy\nprivileges of those who belong to my Church to deny in the public-house\nwhat they admit in the dingle; we have high warranty for such double\nspeaking.  Did not the foundation stone of our Church, Saint Peter, deny\nin the public-house what he had previously professed in the valley?'\n\n'And do you think,' said I, 'that the people of England, who have shown\naversion to anything in the shape of intolerance, will permit such\nbarbarities as you have described?'\n\n'Let them become Papists,' said the man in black; 'only let the majority\nbecome Papists, and you will see.'\n\n'They will never become so,' said I; 'the good sense of the people of\nEngland will never permit them to commit such an absurdity.'\n\n'The good sense of the people of England!' said the man in black, filling\nhimself another glass.\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'the good sense of not only the upper, but the middle and\nlower classes.'\n\n'And of what description of people are the upper class?' said the man in\nblack, putting a lump of sugar into his gin and water.\n\n'Very fine people,' said I, 'monstrously fine people; so, at least, they\nare generally believed to be.'\n\n'He! he!' said the man in black; 'only those think them so who don't know\nthem.  The male part of the upper class are in youth a set of heartless\nprofligates; in old age, a parcel of poor, shaking, nervous paillards.\nThe female part, worthy to be the sisters and wives of such\nwretches--unmarried, full of cold vice, kept under by vanity and\nambition, but which, after marriage, they seek not to restrain; in old\nage, abandoned to vapours and horrors; do you think that such beings will\nafford any obstacle to the progress of the Church in these regions, as\nsoon as her movements are unfettered?'\n\n'I cannot give an opinion; I know nothing of them, except from a\ndistance.  But what think you of the middle classes?'\n\n'Their chief characteristic,' said the man in black, 'is a rage for\ngrandeur and gentility; and that same rage makes us quite sure of them in\nthe long run.  Everything that's lofty meets their unqualified\napprobation; whilst everything humble, or, as they call it, \"low,\" is\nscouted by them.  They begin to have a vague idea that the religion which\nthey have hitherto professed is low; at any rate, that it is not the\nreligion of the mighty ones of the earth, of the great kings and emperors\nwhose shoes they have a vast inclination to kiss, nor was used by the\ngrand personages of whom they have read in their novels and romances,\ntheir Ivanhoes, their Marmions, and their Ladies of the Lake.'\n\n'Do you think that the writings of Scott have had any influence in\nmodifying their religious opinions?'\n\n'Most certainly I do,' said the man in black.  'The writings of that man\nhave made them greater fools than they were before.  All their\nconversation now is about gallant knights, princesses, and cavaliers,\nwith which his pages are stuffed--all of whom were Papists, or very High\nChurch, which is nearly the same thing; and they are beginning to think\nthat the religion of such nice sweet-scented gentry must be something\nvery superfine.  Why, I know at Birmingham the daughter of an ironmonger,\nwho screeches to the piano the Lady of the Lake's hymn to the Virgin\nMary, always weeps when Mary Queen of Scots is mentioned, and fasts on\nthe anniversary of the death of that very wise martyr, Charles the First.\nWhy, I would engage to convert such an idiot to popery in a week, were it\nworth my trouble.  O Cavaliere Gualtiero, avete fatto molto in favore\ndella Santa Sede!'\n\n'If he has,' said I, 'he has done it unwittingly; I never heard before\nthat he was a favourer of the popish delusion.'\n\n'Only in theory,' said the man in black.  'Trust any of the clan\nMac-Sycophant for interfering openly and boldly in favour of any cause on\nwhich the sun does not shine benignantly.  Popery is at present, as you\nsay, suing for grace in these regions _in forma pauperis_; but let\nroyalty once take it up, let old gouty George once patronise it, and I\nwould consent to drink puddle-water if, the very next time the canny Scot\nwas admitted to the royal symposium, he did not say, \"By my faith, yere\nMajesty, I have always thought, at the bottom of my heart, that popery,\nas ill-scrapit tongues ca' it, was a very grand religion; I shall be\nproud to follow your Majesty's example in adopting it.\"'\n\n'I doubt not,' said I, 'that both gouty George and his devoted servant\nwill be mouldering in their tombs long before Royalty in England thinks\nabout adopting popery.'\n\n'We can wait,' said the man in black; 'in these days of rampant\ngentility, there will be no want of kings nor of Scots about them.'\n\n'But not Walters,' said I.\n\n'Our work has been already tolerably well done by one,' said the man in\nblack; 'but if we wanted literature, we should never lack in these\nregions hosts of literary men of some kind or other to eulogise us,\nprovided our religion were in the fashion, and our popish nobles\nchose--and they always do our bidding--to admit the canaille to their\ntables--their kitchen tables.  As for literature in general,' said he,\n'the Santa Sede is not particularly partial to it, it may be employed\nboth ways.  In Italy, in particular, it has discovered that literary men\nare not always disposed to be lickspittles.'\n\n'For example, Dante,' said I.\n\n'Yes,' said the man in black, 'a dangerous personage; that poem of his\ncuts both ways; and then there was Pulci, that _Morgante_ of his cuts\nboth ways, or rather one way, and that sheer against us; and then there\nwas Aretino, who dealt so hard with the _poveri frati_; all writers, at\nleast Italian ones, are not lickspittles.  And then in Spain,--'tis true,\nLope de Vega and Calderon were most inordinate lickspittles; the\n_Principe Constante_ of the last is a curiosity in its way; and then the\n_Mary Stuart_ of Lope; I think I shall recommend the perusal of that work\nto the Birmingham ironmonger's daughter--she has been lately thinking of\nadding \"a slight knowledge of the magneeficent language of the Peninsula\"\nto the rest of her accomplishments, he! he! he!  But then there was\nCervantes, starving, but straight; he deals us some hard knocks in that\nsecond part of his _Quixote_.  Then there were some of the writers of the\npicaresque novels.  No, all literary men are not lickspittles, whether in\nItaly or Spain, or, indeed, upon the Continent; it is only in England\nthat all--'\n\n'Come,' said I, 'Mind what you are about to say of English literary men.'\n\n'Why should I mind?' said the man in black, 'there are no literary men\nhere.  I have heard of literary men living in garrets, but not in\ndingles, whatever philologists may do; I may, therefore, speak out\nfreely.  It is only in England that literary men are invariably\nlickspittles; on which account, perhaps, they are so despised, even by\nthose who benefit by their dirty services.  Look at your fashionable\nnovel-writers, he! he!--and, above all, at your newspaper editors, ho!\nho!'\n\n'You will, of course, except the editors of the--from your censure of the\nlast class?' said I.\n\n'Them!' said the man in black; 'why, they might serve as models in the\ndirty trade to all the rest who practise it.  See how they bepraise their\npatrons, the grand Whig nobility, who hope, by raising the cry of\nliberalism and by putting themselves at the head of the populace, to come\ninto power shortly.  I don't wish to be hard, at present, upon those\nWhigs,' he continued, 'for they are playing our game; but a time will\ncome when, not wanting them, we will kick them to a considerable\ndistance: and then, when toleration is no longer the cry, and the Whigs\nare no longer backed by the populace, see whether the editors of the--will\nstand by them; they will prove themselves as expert lickspittles of\ndespotism as of liberalism.  Don't think they will always bespatter the\nTories and Austria.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'I am sorry to find that you entertain so low an opinion\nof the spirit of English literary men; we will now return, if you please,\nto the subject of the middle classes; I think your strictures upon them\nin general are rather too sweeping--they are not altogether the foolish\npeople which you have described.  Look, for example, at that very\npowerful and numerous body the Dissenters, the descendants of those\nsturdy Patriots who hurled Charles the Simple from his throne.'\n\n'There are some sturdy fellows amongst them, I do not deny,' said the man\nin black, 'especially amongst the preachers, clever withal--two or three\nof that class nearly drove Mr. Platitude mad, as perhaps you are aware,\nbut they are not very numerous; and the old sturdy sort of preachers are\nfast dropping off, and, as we observe with pleasure, are generally\nsucceeded by frothy coxcombs, whom it would not be very difficult to gain\nover.  But what we most rely upon as an instrument to bring the\nDissenters over to us is the mania for gentility, which amongst them has\nof late become as great, and more ridiculous than amongst the middle\nclasses belonging to the Church of England.  All the plain and simple\nfashions of their forefathers they are either about to abandon, or have\nalready done so.  Look at the most part of their chapels--no longer\nmodest brick edifices, situated in quiet and retired streets, but lunatic-\nlooking erections, in what the simpletons call the modern Gothic taste,\nof Portland stone, with a cross upon the top, and the site generally the\nmost conspicuous that can be found.  And look at the manner in which they\neducate their children--I mean those that are wealthy.  They do not even\nwish them to be Dissenters--\"the sweet dears shall enjoy the advantages\nof good society, of which their parents were debarred.\"  So the girls are\nsent to tip-top boarding-schools, where amongst other trash they read\n_Rokeby_, and are taught to sing snatches from that high-flying ditty,\nthe \"Cavalier\"--\n\n   'Would you match the base Skippon, and Massey, and Brown,\n   With the barons of England, who fight for the crown?--\n\nhe! he! their own names.  Whilst the lads are sent to those hotbeds of\npride and folly--colleges, whence they return with a greater contempt for\neverything \"low,\" and especially for their own pedigree, than they went\nwith.  I tell you, friend, the children of Dissenters, if not their\nparents, are going over to the Church, as you call it, and the Church is\ngoing over to Rome.'\n\n'I do not see the justice of that latter assertion at all,' said I; 'some\nof the Dissenters' children may be coming over to the Church of England,\nand yet the Church of England be very far from going over to Rome.'\n\n'In the high road for it, I assure you,' said the man in black; 'part of\nit is going to abandon, the rest to lose their prerogative, and when a\nChurch no longer retains its prerogative, it speedily loses its own\nrespect, and that of others.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'if the higher classes have all the vices and follies\nwhich you represent, on which point I can say nothing, as I have never\nmixed with them; and even supposing the middle classes are the foolish\nbeings you would fain make them, and which I do not believe them as a\nbody to be, you would still find some resistance amongst the lower\nclasses: I have a considerable respect for their good sense and\nindependence of character; but pray let me hear your opinion of them.'\n\n'As for the lower classes,' said the man in black, 'I believe them to be\nthe most brutal wretches in the world, the most addicted to foul feeding,\nfoul language, and foul vices of every kind; wretches who have neither\nlove for country, religion, nor anything save their own vile selves.  You\nsurely do not think that they would oppose a change of religion! why,\nthere is not one of them but would hurrah for the Pope, or Mahomet, for\nthe sake of a hearty gorge and a drunken bout, like those which they are\ntreated with at election contests.'\n\n'Has your church any followers amongst them?' said I.\n\n'Wherever there happens to be a Romish family of considerable\npossessions,' said the man in black, 'our church is sure to have\nfollowers of the lower class, who have come over in the hope of getting\nsomething in the shape of dole or donation.  As, however, the Romish is\nnot yet the dominant religion, and the clergy of the English\nestablishment have some patronage to bestow, the churches are not quite\ndeserted by the lower classes; yet, were the Romish to become the\nestablished religion, they would, to a certainty, all go over to it; you\ncan scarcely imagine what a self-interested set they are--for example,\nthe landlord of that public-house in which I first met you, having lost a\nsum of money upon a cock-fight, and his affairs in consequence being in a\nbad condition, is on the eve of coming over to us, in the hope that two\nold Popish females of property, whom I confess, will advance a sum of\nmoney to set him up again in the world.'\n\n'And what could have put such an idea into the poor fellow's head?' said\nI.\n\n'Oh, he and I have had some conversation upon the state of his affairs,'\nsaid the man in black; 'I think he might make a rather useful convert in\nthese parts, provided things take a certain turn, as they doubtless will.\nIt is no bad thing to have a fighting fellow, who keeps a public-house,\nbelonging to one's religion.  He has been occasionally employed as a\nbully at elections by the Tory party, and he may serve us in the same\ncapacity.  The fellow comes of a good stock; I heard him say that his\nfather headed the High Church mob who sacked and burnt Priestley's house\nat Birmingham, towards the end of the last century.'\n\n'A disgraceful affair,' said I.\n\n'What do you mean by a disgraceful affair?' said the man in black.  'I\nassure you that nothing has occurred for the last fifty years which has\ngiven the High Church party so much credit in the eyes of Rome as\nthat,--we did not imagine that the fellows had so much energy.  Had they\nfollowed up that affair by twenty others of a similar kind, they would by\nthis time have had everything in their own power; but they did not, and,\nas a necessary consequence, they are reduced to almost nothing.'\n\n'I suppose,' said I, 'that your Church would have acted very differently\nin its place.'\n\n'It has always done so,' said the man in black, coolly sipping.  'Our\nChurch has always armed the brute population against the genius and\nintellect of a country, provided that same intellect and genius were not\nwilling to become its instruments and eulogists; and provided we once\nobtain a firm hold here again, we would not fail to do so.  We would\noccasionally stuff the beastly rabble with horseflesh and bitter ale, and\nthen halloo them on against all those who were obnoxious to us.'\n\n'Horseflesh and bitter ale!' I replied.\n\n'Yes,' said the man in black; 'horseflesh and bitter ale--the favourite\ndelicacies of their Saxon ancestors, who were always ready to do our\nbidding after a liberal allowance of such cheer.  There is a tradition in\nour Church, that before the Northumbrian rabble, at the instigation of\nAustin, attacked and massacred the presbyterian monks of Bangor, they had\nbeen allowed a good gorge of horseflesh and bitter ale.  He! he! he!'\ncontinued the man in black, 'what a fine spectacle to see such a mob,\nheaded by a fellow like our friend the landlord, sack the house of\nanother Priestley!'\n\n'Then you don't deny that we have had a Priestley,' said I, 'and admit\nthe possibility of our having another?  You were lately observing that\nall English literary men were sycophants?'\n\n'Lickspittles,' said the man in black; 'yes, I admit that you have had a\nPriestley, but he was a Dissenter of the old class; you have had him, and\nperhaps may have another.'\n\n'Perhaps we may,' said I.  'But with respect to the lower classes, have\nyou mixed much with them?'\n\n'I have mixed with all classes,' said the man in black, 'and with the\nlower not less than the upper and middle; they are much as I have\ndescribed them; and of the three, the lower are the worst.  I never knew\none of them that possessed the slightest principle, no, not ---.  It is\ntrue, there was one fellow whom I once met, who--; but it is a long\nstory, and the affair happened abroad.--I ought to know something of the\nEnglish people,' he continued, after a moment's pause; 'I have been many\nyears amongst them, labouring in the cause of the Church.'\n\n'Your See must have had great confidence in your powers when it selected\nyou to labour for it in these parts,' said I.\n\n'They chose me,' said the man in black, 'principally because, being of\nBritish extraction and education, I could speak the English language and\nbear a glass of something strong.  It is the opinion of my See that it\nwould hardly do to send a missionary into a country like this who is not\nwell versed in English--a country where, they think, so far from\nunderstanding any language besides his own, scarcely one individual in\nten speaks his own intelligibly; or an ascetic person where, as they say,\nhigh and low, male and female, are, at some period of their lives, fond\nof a renovating glass, as it is styled--in other words, of tippling.'\n\n'Your See appears to entertain a very strange opinion of the English,'\nsaid I.\n\n'Not altogether an unjust one,' said the man in black, lifting the glass\nto his mouth.\n\n'Well,' said I, 'it is certainly very kind on its part to wish to bring\nback such a set of beings beneath its wing.'\n\n'Why, as to the kindness of my See,' said the man in black, 'I have not\nmuch to say; my See has generally in what it does a tolerably good\nmotive; these heretics possess in plenty what my See has a great\nhankering for, and can turn to a good account--money!'\n\n'The Founder of the Christian religion cared nothing for money,' said I.\n\n'What have we to do with what the Founder of the Christian religion cared\nfor?' said the man in black.  'How could our temples be built and our\npriests supported without money?  But you are unwise to reproach us with\na desire of obtaining money; you forget that your own Church, if the\nChurch of England be your own Church, as I suppose it is from the\nwillingness which you displayed in the public-house to fight for it, is\nequally avaricious; look at your greedy Bishops and your corpulent\nRectors--do they imitate Christ in His disregard for money?  You might as\nwell tell me that they imitate Christ in His meekness and humility.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'whatever their faults may be, you can't say that they go\nto Rome for money.'\n\nThe man in black made no direct answer, but appeared by the motion of his\nlips to be repeating something to himself.\n\n'I see your glass is again empty,' said I; 'perhaps you will replenish\nit.'\n\nThe man in black arose from his seat, adjusted his habiliments, which\nwere rather in disorder, and placed upon his head his hat, which he had\nlaid aside; then, looking at me, who was still lying on the ground, he\nsaid--'I might, perhaps, take another glass, though I believe I have had\nquite as much as I can well bear; but I do not wish to hear you utter\nanything more this evening, after that last observation of yours--it is\nquite original; I will meditate upon it on my pillow this night, after\nhaving said an ave and a pater--go to Rome for money!'  He then made\nBelle a low bow, slightly motioned to me with his hand as if bidding\nfarewell, and then left the dingle with rather uneven steps.\n\n'Go to Rome for money,' I heard him say as he ascended the winding path,\n'he! he! he!  Go to Rome for money, ho! ho! ho!'\n\n{picture:'Go to Rome for money,' I heard him say as he ascended the\nwinding path, 'he! he! he!  Go to Rome for money, ho! ho! ho!':\npage538.jpg}\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCV\n\n\nWooded retreat--Fresh shoes--Wood fire--Ash, when green--Queen of\nChina--Cleverest people--Declensions--Armenian--Thunder--Deep olive--What\ndo you mean?--Koul Adonai--The thick bushes--Wood pigeon--Old Gothe.\n\nNearly three days elapsed without anything of particular moment\noccurring.  Belle drove the little cart containing her merchandise about\nthe neighbourhood, returning to the dingle towards the evening.  As for\nmyself, I kept within my wooded retreat, working during the periods of\nher absence leisurely at my forge.  Having observed that the quadruped\nwhich my companion drove was as much in need of shoes as my own had been\nsome time previously, I had determined to provide it with a set, and\nduring the aforesaid periods occupied myself in preparing them.  As I was\nemployed three mornings and afternoons about them, I am sure that the\nreader will agree that I worked leisurely, or rather, lazily.  On the\nthird day Belle arrived somewhat later than usual; I was lying on my back\nat the bottom of the dingle, employed in tossing up the shoes which I had\nproduced, and catching them as they fell--some being always in the air\nmounting or descending, somewhat after the fashion of the waters of a\nfountain.\n\n{picture:I was lying on my back at the bottom of the dingle, employed in\ntossing up the shoes, and catching them as they fell: page540.jpg}\n\n'Why have you been absent so long?' said I to Belle; 'it must be long\npast four by the day.'\n\n'I have been almost killed by the heat,' said Belle; 'I was never out in\na more sultry day--the poor donkey, too, could scarcely move along.'\n\n'He shall have fresh shoes,' said I, continuing my exercise; 'here they\nare quite ready; to-morrow I will tack them on.'\n\n'And why are you playing with them in that manner?' said Belle.\n\n'Partly in triumph at having made them, and partly to show that I can do\nsomething besides making them; it is not every one who, after having made\na set of horse-shoes, can keep them going up and down in the air, without\nletting one fall--'\n\n'One has now fallen on your chin,' said Belle.\n\n'And another on my cheek,' said I, getting up; 'it is time to discontinue\nthe game, for the last shoe drew blood.'\n\nBelle went to her own little encampment; and as for myself, after having\nflung the donkey's shoes into my tent, I put some fresh wood on the fire,\nwhich was nearly out, and hung the kettle over it.  I then issued forth\nfrom the dingle, and strolled round the wood that surrounded it; for a\nlong time I was busied in meditation, looking at the ground, striking\nwith my foot, half unconsciously, the tufts of grass and thistles that I\nmet in my way.  After some time, I lifted up my eyes to the sky, at first\nvacantly, and then with more attention, turning my head in all directions\nfor a minute or two; after which I returned to the dingle.  Isopel was\nseated near the fire, over which the kettle was now hung; she had changed\nher dress--no signs of the dust and fatigue of her late excursion\nremained; she had just added to the fire a small billet of wood, two or\nthree of which I had left beside it; the fire cracked, and a sweet odour\nfilled the dingle.\n\n'I am fond of sitting by a wood fire,' said Belle, 'when abroad, whether\nit be hot or cold; I love to see the flames dart out of the wood; but\nwhat kind is this, and where did you get it?'\n\n'It is ash,' said I, 'green ash.  Somewhat less than a week ago, whilst I\nwas wandering along the road by the side of a wood, I came to a place\nwhere some peasants were engaged in cutting up and clearing away a\nconfused mass of fallen timber: a mighty aged oak had given way the night\nbefore, and in its fall had shivered some smaller trees; the upper part\nof the oak, and the fragments of the rest, lay across the road.  I\npurchased, for a trifle, a bundle or two, and the wood on the fire is\npart of it--ash, green ash.'\n\n'That makes good the old rhyme,' said Belle, 'which I have heard sung by\nthe old women in the great house:--\n\n   'Ash, when green,\n   Is fire for a queen.'\n\n{picture:'Ash, when green,\nIs fire for a queen.': page543.jpg}\n\n'And on fairer form of queen ash fire never shone,' said I, 'than on\nthine, O beauteous queen of the dingle.'\n\n'I am half disposed to be angry with you, young man,' said Belle.\n\n'And why not entirely?' said I.\n\nBelle made no reply.\n\n'Shall I tell you?' I demanded.  'You had no objection to the first part\nof the speech, but you did not like being called queen of the dingle.\nWell, if I had the power, I would make you queen of something better than\nthe dingle--Queen of China.  Come, let us have tea.'\n\n'Something less would content me,' said Belle, sighing, as she rose to\nprepare our evening meal.\n\nSo we took tea together, Belle and I.  'How delicious tea is after a hot\nsummer's day and a long walk,' said she.\n\n'I daresay it is most refreshing then,' said I; 'but I have heard people\nsay that they most enjoy it on a cold winter's night, when the kettle is\nhissing on the fire, and their children playing on the hearth.'\n\nBelle sighed.  'Where does tea come from?' she presently demanded.\n\n'From China,' said I; 'I just now mentioned it, and the mention of it put\nme in mind of tea.'\n\n'What kind of country is China?'\n\n'I know very little about it; all I know is, that it is a very large\ncountry far to the East, but scarcely large enough to contain its\ninhabitants, who are so numerous, that though China does not cover one-\nninth part of the world, its inhabitants amount to one-third of the\npopulation of the world.'\n\n'And do they talk as we do?'\n\n'Oh no!  I know nothing of their language; but I have heard that it is\nquite different from all others, and so difficult that none but the\ncleverest people amongst foreigners can master it, on which account,\nperhaps, only the French pretend to know anything about it.'\n\n'Are the French so very clever, then?' said Belle.\n\n'They say there are no people like them, at least in Europe.  But talking\nof Chinese reminds me that I have not for some time past given you a\nlesson in Armenian.  The word for tea in Armenian is--by the bye what is\nthe Armenian word for tea?'\n\n'That's your affair, not mine,' said Belle; 'it seems hard that the\nmaster should ask the scholar.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'whatever the word may be in Armenian, it is a noun; and\nas we have never yet declined an Armenian noun together, we may as well\ntake this opportunity of declining one.  Belle, there are ten declensions\nin Armenian!\n\n'What's a declension?'\n\n'The way of declining a noun.'\n\n'Then, in the civilest way imaginable, I decline the noun.  Is that a\ndeclension?'\n\n'You should never play on words; to do so is low, vulgar, smelling of the\npothouse, the workhouse.  Belle, I insist on your declining an Armenian\nnoun.'\n\n'I have done so already,' said Belle.\n\n'If you go on in this way,' said I, 'I shall decline taking any more tea\nwith you.  Will you decline an Armenian noun?'\n\n'I don't like the language,' said Belle.  'If you must teach me\nlanguages, why not teach me French or Chinese?'\n\n'I know nothing of Chinese; and as for French, none but a Frenchman is\nclever enough to speak it--to say nothing of teaching; no, we will stick\nto Armenian, unless, indeed, you would prefer Welsh!'\n\n'Welsh, I have heard, is vulgar,' said Belle; 'so, if I must learn one of\nthe two, I will prefer Armenian, which I never heard of till you\nmentioned it to me; though, of the two, I really think Welsh sounds\nbest.'\n\n'The Armenian noun,' said I, 'which I propose for your declension this\nnight, is ---, which signifieth Master.'\n\n'I neither like the word nor the sound,' said Belle.\n\n'I can't help that,' said I; 'it is the word I choose: Master, with all\nits variations, being the first noun the sound of which I would have you\nlearn from my lips.  Come, let us begin--\n\n'A master.  Of a master, etc.  Repeat--'\n\n'I am not much used to say the word,' said Belle, 'but to oblige you I\nwill decline it as you wish'; and thereupon Belle declined Master in\nArmenian.\n\n'You have declined the noun very well,' said I; 'that is in the singular\nnumber; we will now go to the plural.'\n\n'What is the plural?' said Belle.\n\n'That which implies more than one, for example, Masters; you shall now go\nthrough masters in Armenian.'\n\n'Never,' said Belle, 'never; it is bad to have one master, but more I\nwould never bear, whether in Armenian or English.'\n\n'You do not understand,' said I; 'I merely want you to decline Masters in\nArmenian.'\n\n'I do decline them; I will have nothing to do with them, nor with master\neither; I was wrong to--What sound is that?'\n\n'I did not hear it, but I daresay it is thunder; in Armenian--'\n\n'Never mind what it is in Armenian; but why do you think it is thunder?'\n\n'Ere I returned from my stroll, I looked up into the heavens, and by\ntheir appearance I judged that a storm was nigh at hand.'\n\n'And why did you not tell me so?'\n\n'You never asked me about the state of the atmosphere, and I am not in\nthe habit of giving my opinion to people on any subject, unless\nquestioned.  But, setting that aside, can you blame me for not troubling\nyou with forebodings about storm and tempest, which might have prevented\nthe pleasure you promised yourself in drinking tea, or perhaps a lesson\nin Armenian, though you pretend to dislike the latter?'\n\n'My dislike is not pretended,' said Belle; 'I hate the sound of it, but I\nlove my tea, and it was kind of you not to wish to cast a cloud over my\nlittle pleasures; the thunder came quite time enough to interrupt it\nwithout being anticipated--there is another peal--I will clear away, and\nsee that my tent is in a condition to resist the storm; and I think you\nhad better bestir yourself.'\n\nIsopel departed, and I remained seated on my stone, as nothing belonging\nto myself required any particular attention; in about a quarter of an\nhour she returned, and seated herself upon her stool.\n\n'How dark the place is become since I left you,' said she; 'just as if\nnight were just at hand.'\n\n'Look up at the sky,' said I; 'and you will not wonder; it is all of a\ndeep olive.  The wind is beginning to rise; hark how it moans among the\nbranches, and see how their tops are bending; it brings dust on its\nwings--I felt some fall on my face; and what is this, a drop of rain?'\n\n'We shall have plenty anon,' said Belle; 'do you hear? it already begins\nto hiss upon the embers; that fire of ours will soon be extinguished.'\n\n'It is not probable that we shall want it,' said I, 'but we had better\nseek shelter: let us go into my tent.'\n\n'Go in,' said Belle, 'but you go in alone; as for me, I will seek my\nown.'\n\n'You are right,' said I, 'to be afraid of me; I have taught you to\ndecline master in Armenian.'\n\n'You almost tempt me,' said Belle, 'to make you decline mistress in\nEnglish.'\n\n'To make matters short,' said I, 'I decline a mistress.'\n\n'What do you mean?' said Belle, angrily.\n\n'I have merely done what you wished me,' said I, 'and in your own style;\nthere is no other way of declining anything in English, for in English\nthere are no declensions.'\n\n'The rain is increasing,' said Belle.\n\n'It is so,' said I; 'I shall go to my tent; you may come if you please; I\ndo assure you I am not afraid of you.'\n\n'Nor I of you,' said Belle; 'so I will come.  Why should I be afraid?  I\ncan take my own part; that is--'\n\nWe went into the tent and sat down, and now the rain began to pour with\nvehemence.  'I hope we shall not be flooded in this hollow,' said I to\nBelle.  'There is no fear of that,' said Belle; 'the wandering people,\namongst other names, call it the dry hollow.  I believe there is a\npassage somewhere or other by which the wet is carried off.  There must\nbe a cloud right above us, it is so dark.  Oh! what a flash!'\n\n'And what a peal!' said I; 'that is what the Hebrews call Koul Adonai--the\nvoice of the Lord.  Are you afraid?'\n\n'No,' said Belle, 'I rather like to hear it.'\n\n'You are right,' said I, 'I am fond of the sound of thunder myself.  There\nis nothing like it; Koul Adonai behadar: the voice of the Lord is a\nglorious voice, as the prayer-book version hath it.'\n\n'There is something awful in it,' said Belle; 'and then the lightning--the\nwhole dingle is now in a blaze.'\n\n'\"The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the\nthick bushes.\"  As you say, there is something awful in thunder.'\n\n'There are all kinds of noises above us,' said Belle; 'surely I heard the\ncrashing of a tree?'\n\n'\"The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedar trees,\"' said I, 'but what you\nhear is caused by a convulsion of the air; during a thunder-storm there\nare occasionally all kinds of aerial noises.  Ab Gwilym, who, next to\nKing David, has best described a thunderstorm, speaks of these aerial\nnoises in the following manner:--\n\n   'Astonied now I stand at strains,\n   As of ten thousand clanking chains;\n   And once, methought that, overthrown,\n   The welkin's oaks came whelming down;\n   Upon my head up starts my hair:\n   Why hunt abroad the hounds of air?\n   What cursed hag is screeching high,\n   Whilst crash goes all her crockery?'\n\nYou would hardly believe, Belle, that though I offered at least ten\nthousand lines nearly as good as those to the booksellers in London, the\nsimpletons were so blind to their interest, as to refuse purchasing\nthem!'\n\n'I don't wonder at it,' said Belle, 'especially if such dreadful\nexpressions frequently occur as that towards the end;--surely that was\nthe crash of a tree?'\n\n'Ah!' said I, 'there falls the cedar tree--I mean the sallow; one of the\ntall trees on the outside of the dingle has been snapped short.'\n\n'What a pity,' said Belle, 'that the fine old oak, which you saw the\npeasants cutting up, gave way the other night, when scarcely a breath of\nair was stirring; how much better to have fallen in a storm like this,\nthe fiercest I remember.'\n\n'I don't think so,' said I; 'after braving a thousand tempests, it was\nmeeter for it to fall of itself than to be vanquished at last.  But to\nreturn to Ab Gwilym's poetry: he was above culling dainty words, and\nspoke boldly his mind on all subjects.  Enraged with the thunder for\nparting him and Morfydd, he says, at the conclusion of his ode,\n\n   'My curse, O Thunder, cling to thee,\n   For parting my dear pearl and me!'\n\n'You and I shall part, that is, I shall go to my tent, if you persist in\nrepeating from him.  The man must have been a savage.  A poor wood-pigeon\nhas fallen dead.'\n\n'Yes,' said I, 'there he lies, just outside the tent; often have I\nlistened to his note when alone in this wilderness.  So you do not like\nAb Gwilym; what say you to old Gothe?--\n\n   'Mist shrouds the night, and rack;\n   Hear, in the woods, what an awful crack!\n   Wildly the owls are flitting,\n   Hark to the pillars splitting\n   Of palaces verdant ever,\n   The branches quiver and sever,\n   The mighty stems are creaking,\n   The poor roots breaking and shrieking,\n   In wild mixt ruin down dashing,\n   O'er one another they're crashing;\n   Whilst 'midst the rocks so hoary\n   Whirlwinds hurry and worry.\n   Hear'st not, sister--'\n\n'Hark!' said Belle, 'hark!'\n\n   'Hear'st not, sister, a chorus\n   Of voices--?'\n\n'No,' said Belle, 'but I hear a voice.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVI\n\n\nA shout--A fireball--See to the horses--Passing away--Gap in the hedge--On\nthree wheels--Why do you stop?--No craven heart--The cordial--Across the\ncountry--Small bags.\n\nI listened attentively, but I could hear nothing but the loud clashing of\nbranches, the pattering of rain, and the muttered growl of thunder.  I\nwas about to tell Belle that she must have been mistaken, when I heard a\nshout--indistinct, it is true, owing to the noises aforesaid--from some\npart of the field above the dingle.  'I will soon see what's the matter,'\nsaid I to Belle, starting up.  'I will go too;' said the girl.  'Stay\nwhere you are,' said I; 'if I need you, I will call'; and, without\nwaiting for any answer, I hurried to the mouth of the dingle.  I was\nabout a few yards only from the top of the ascent, when I beheld a blaze\nof light, from whence I knew not; the next moment there was a loud crash,\nand I appeared involved in a cloud of sulphurous smoke.  'Lord have mercy\nupon us!' I heard a voice say, and methought I heard the plunging and\nstruggling of horses.  I had stopped short on hearing the crash, for I\nwas half stunned; but I now hurried forward, and in a moment stood upon\nthe plain.  Here I was instantly aware of the cause of the crash and the\nsmoke.  One of those balls, generally called fireballs, had fallen from\nthe clouds, and was burning on the plain at a short distance; and the\nvoice which I had heard, and the plunging, were as easily accounted for.\nNear the left-hand corner of the grove which surrounded the dingle, and\nabout ten yards from the fireball, I perceived a chaise, with a postilion\non the box, who was making efforts, apparently useless, to control his\nhorses, which were kicking and plunging in the highest degree of\nexcitement.  I instantly ran towards the chaise, in order to offer what\nhelp was in my power.  'Help me,' said the poor fellow, as I drew nigh;\nbut before I could reach the horses, they had turned rapidly round, one\nof the fore-wheels flew from its axle-tree, the chaise was overset, and\nthe postilion flung violently from his seat upon the field.  The horses\nnow became more furious than before, kicking desperately, and\nendeavouring to disengage themselves from the fallen chaise.  As I was\nhesitating whether to run to the assistance of the postilion or endeavour\nto disengage the animals, I heard the voice of Belle exclaiming, 'See to\nthe horses, I will look after the man.'  She had, it seems, been alarmed\nby the crash which accompanied the firebolt, and had hurried up to learn\nthe cause.  I forthwith seized the horses by the heads, and used all the\nmeans I possessed to soothe and pacify them, employing every gentle\nmodulation of which my voice was capable.  Belle, in the meantime, had\nraised up the man, who was much stunned by his fall; but, presently\nrecovering his recollection to a certain degree, he came limping to me,\nholding his hand to his right thigh.  'The first thing that must now be\ndone,' said I, 'is to free these horses from the traces; can you\nundertake to do so?'  ' I think I can,' said the man, looking at me\nsomewhat stupidly.  'I will help,' said Belle, and without loss of time\nlaid hold of one of the traces.  The man, after a short pause, also set\nto work, and in a few minutes the horses were extricated.  'Now,' said I\nto the man, 'what is next to be done?'  'I don't know,' said he; 'indeed,\nI scarcely know anything; I have been so frightened by this horrible\nstorm, and so shaken by my fall.'  'I think,' said I, 'that the storm is\npassing away, so cast your fears away too; and as for your fall, you must\nbear it as lightly as you can.  I will tie the horses amongst those\ntrees, and then we will all betake us to the hollow below.'  'And what's\nto become of my chaise?' said the postilion, looking ruefully on the\nfallen vehicle.  'Let us leave the chaise for the present,' said I; 'we\ncan be of no use to it.'  'I don't like to leave my chaise lying on the\nground in this weather,' said the man; 'I love my chaise, and him whom it\nbelongs to.'  'You are quite right to be fond of yourself,' said I, 'on\nwhich account I advise you to seek shelter from the rain as soon as\npossible.'  'I was not talking of myself,' said the man, 'but my master,\nto whom the chaise belongs.'  'I thought you called the chaise yours,'\nsaid I.  'That's my way of speaking,' said the man; 'but the chaise is my\nmaster's, and a better master does not live.  Don't you think we could\nmanage to raise up the chaise?'  'And what is to become of the horses?'\nsaid I.  'I love my horses well enough,' said the man; 'but they will\ntake less harm than the chaise.  We two can never lift up that chaise.'\n'But we three can,' said Belle; 'at least, I think so; and I know where\nto find two poles which will assist us.'  'You had better go to the\ntent,' said I, 'you will be wet through.'  'I care not for a little\nwetting,' said Belle; 'moreover, I have more gowns than one--see you\nafter the horses.'  Thereupon, I led the horses past the mouth of the\ndingle, to a place where a gap in the hedge afforded admission to the\ncopse or plantation on the southern side.  Forcing them through the gap,\nI led them to a spot amidst the trees which I deemed would afford them\nthe most convenient place for standing; then, darting down into the\ndingle, I brought up a rope, and also the halter of my own nag, and with\nthese fastened them each to a separate tree in the best manner I could.\nThis done, I returned to the chaise and the postilion.  In a minute or\ntwo Belle arrived with two poles which, it seems, had long been lying,\novergrown with brushwood, in a ditch or hollow behind the plantation.\nWith these both she and I set to work in endeavouring to raise the fallen\nchaise from the ground.\n\nWe experienced considerable difficulty in this undertaking; at length,\nwith the assistance of the postilion, we saw our efforts crowned with\nsuccess--the chaise was lifted up, and stood upright on three wheels.\n\n{picture:At length, with the assistance of the postilion, we saw our\nefforts crowned with success--the chaise was lifted up, and stood upright\non three wheels: page552.jpg}\n\n'We may leave it here in safety,' said I, 'for it will hardly move away\non three wheels, even supposing it could run by itself; I am afraid there\nis work here for a wheelwright, in which case I cannot assist you; if you\nwere in need of a blacksmith it would be otherwise.'  'I don't think\neither the wheel or the axle is hurt,' said the postilion, who had been\nhandling both; 'it is only the linch-pin having dropped out that caused\nthe wheel to fly off; if I could but find the linch-pin!--though,\nperhaps, it fell out a mile away.'  'Very likely,' said I; 'but never\nmind the linch-pin, I can make you one, or something that will serve: but\nI can't stay here any longer, I am going to my place below with this\nyoung gentlewoman, and you had better follow us.'  'I am ready,' said the\nman; and after lifting up the wheel and propping it against the chaise,\nhe went with us, slightly limping, and with his hand pressed to his\nthigh.\n\nAs we were descending the narrow path, Belle leading the way, and myself\nthe last of the party, the postilion suddenly stopped short, and looked\nabout him.  'Why do you stop?' said I.  'I don't wish to offend you,'\nsaid the man, 'but this seems to be a strange place you are leading me\ninto; I hope you and the young gentlewoman, as you call her, don't mean\nme any harm--you seemed in a great hurry to bring me here.'  'We wished\nto get you out of the rain,' said I, 'and ourselves too; that is, if we\ncan, which I rather doubt, for the canvas of a tent is slight shelter in\nsuch a rain; but what harm should we wish to do you?'  'You may think I\nhave money,' said the man, 'and I have some, but only thirty shillings,\nand for a sum like that it would be hardly worth while to--'  'Would it\nnot?' said I; 'thirty shillings, after all, are thirty shillings, and for\nwhat I know, half a dozen throats may have been cut in this place for\nthat sum at the rate of five shillings each; moreover, there are the\nhorses, which would serve to establish this young gentlewoman and myself\nin housekeeping, provided we were thinking of such a thing.'  'Then I\nsuppose I have fallen into pretty hands,' said the man, putting himself\nin a posture of defence; 'but I'll show no craven heart; and if you\nattempt to lay hands on me, I'll try to pay you in your own coin.  I'm\nrather lamed in the leg, but I can still use my fists; so come on, both\nof you, man and woman, if woman this be, though she looks more like a\ngrenadier.'\n\n'Let me hear no more of this nonsense,' said Belle; 'if you are afraid,\nyou can go back to your chaise--we only seek to do you a kindness.'\n\n'Why, he was just now talking of cutting throats,' said the man.  'You\nbrought it on yourself,' said Belle; 'you suspected us, and he wished to\npass a joke upon you; he would not hurt a hair of your head, were your\ncoach laden with gold, nor would I.'  'Well,' said the man, 'I was\nwrong--here's my hand to both of you,' shaking us by the hands; 'I'll go\nwith you where you please, but I thought this a strange lonesome place,\nthough I ought not much to mind strange lonesome places, having been in\nplenty of such when I was a servant in Italy, without coming to any\nharm--come, let us move on, for 'tis a shame to keep you two in the\nrain.'\n\nSo we descended the path which led into the depths of the dingle; at the\nbottom I conducted the postilion to my tent, which, though the rain\ndripped and trickled through it, afforded some shelter; there I bade him\nsit down on the log of wood, whilst I placed myself as usual on my stone.\nBelle in the meantime had repaired to her own place of abode.  After a\nlittle time, I produced a bottle of the cordial of which I have\npreviously had occasion to speak, and made my guest take a considerable\ndraught.  I then offered him some, bread and cheese, which he accepted\nwith thanks.  In about an hour the rain had much abated: 'What do you now\npropose to do?' said I.  'I scarcely know,' said the man; 'I suppose I\nmust endeavour to put on the wheel with your help.'  'How far are you\nfrom your home?' I demanded.  'Upwards of thirty miles,' said the man;\n'my master keeps an inn on the great north road, and from thence I\nstarted early this morning with a family, which I conveyed across the\ncountry to a hall at some distance from here.  On my return I was beset\nby the thunderstorm, which frightened the horses, who dragged the chaise\noff the road to the field above, and overset it as you saw.  I had\nproposed to pass the night at an inn about twelve miles from here on my\nway back, though how I am to get there to-night I scarcely know, even if\nwe can put on the wheel, for, to tell you the truth, I am shaken by my\nfall, and the smoulder and smoke of that fireball have rather bewildered\nmy head; I am, moreover, not much acquainted with the way.\n\n'The best thing you can do,' said I, 'is to pass the night here; I will\npresently light a fire, and endeavour to make you comfortable--in the\nmorning we will see to your wheel.'  'Well,' said the man, 'I shall be\nglad to pass the night here, provided I do not intrude, but I must see to\nthe horses.'  Thereupon I conducted the man to the place where the horses\nwere tied.  'The trees drip very much upon them,' said the man, 'and it\nwill not do for them to remain here all night; they will be better out on\nthe field picking the grass; but first of all they must have a good feed\nof corn.'  Thereupon he went to his chaise, from which he presently\nbrought two small bags, partly filled with corn--into them he inserted\nthe mouths of the horses, tying them over their heads.  'Here we will\nleave them for a time,' said the man; 'when I think they have had enough,\nI will come back, tie their fore-legs, and let them pick about.'\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVII\n\n\nFire of charcoal--The new-comer--No wonder!--Not a blacksmith--A love\naffair--Gretna Green--A cool thousand--Family estates--Borough\ninterest--Grand education--Let us hear--Already quarrelling--Honourable\nparents--Most heroically--Not common people--Fresh charcoal.\n\nIt might be about ten o'clock at night.  Belle, the postilion, and\nmyself, sat just within the tent, by a fire of charcoal which I had\nkindled in the chafing-pan.  The man had removed the harness from his\nhorses, and, after tethering their legs, had left them for the night in\nthe field above to regale themselves on what grass they could find.  The\nrain had long since entirely ceased, and the moon and stars shone bright\nin the firmament, up to which, putting aside the canvas, I occasionally\nlooked from the depths of the dingle.  Large drops of water, however,\nfalling now and then upon the tent from the neighbouring trees, would\nhave served, could we have forgotten it, to remind us of the recent\nstorm, and also a certain chilliness in the atmosphere, unusual to the\nseason, proceeding from the moisture with which the ground was saturated;\nyet these circumstances only served to make our party enjoy the charcoal\nfire the more.  There we sat bending over it: Belle, with her long\nbeautiful hair streaming over her magnificent shoulders; the postilion\nsmoking his pipe, in his shirt-sleeves and waistcoat, having flung aside\nhis greatcoat, which had sustained a thorough wetting; and I without my\nwagoner's slop, of which, it being in the same plight, I had also\ndivested myself.\n\nThe new-comer was a well-made fellow of about thirty, with an open and\nagreeable countenance.  I found him very well informed for a man in his\nstation, and with some pretensions to humour.  After we had discoursed\nfor some time on indifferent subjects, the postilion, who had exhausted\nhis pipe, took it from his mouth, and, knocking out the ashes upon the\nground, exclaimed, 'I little thought, when I got up in the morning, that\nI should spend the night in such agreeable company, and after such a\nfright.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'I am glad that your opinion of us has improved; it is\nnot long since you seemed to hold us in rather a suspicious light.'\n\n'And no wonder,' said the man, 'seeing the place you were taking me to!  I\nwas not a little, but very much afraid of ye both; and so I continued for\nsome time, though, not to show a craven heart, I pretended to be quite\nsatisfied; but I see I was altogether mistaken about ye.  I thought you\nvagrant gypsy folks and trampers; but now--'\n\n'Vagrant gypsy folks and trampers,' said I; 'and what are we but people\nof that stamp?'\n\n'Oh,' said the postilion, 'if you wish to be thought such, I am far too\ncivil a person to contradict you, especially after your kindness to me,\nbut--'\n\n'But!' said I; 'what do you mean by but?  I would have you to know that I\nam proud of being a travelling blacksmith; look at these donkey-shoes, I\nfinished them this day.'\n\nThe postilion took the shoes and examined them.  'So you made these\nshoes?' he cried at last.\n\n{picture:The postilion took the shoes and examined them.  'So you made\nthese shoes?' he cried at last: page557.jpg}\n\n'To be sure I did; do you doubt it?'\n\n'Not in the least,' said the man.\n\n'Ah! ah!' said I, 'I thought I should bring you back to your original\nopinion.  I am, then, a vagrant gypsy body, a tramper, a wandering\nblacksmith.'\n\n'Not a blacksmith, whatever else you may be,' said the postilion,\nlaughing.\n\n'Then how do you account for my making those shoes?'\n\n'By your not being a blacksmith,' said the postilion; 'no blacksmith\nwould have made shoes in that manner.  Besides, what did you mean just\nnow by saying you had finished these shoes to-day?  A real blacksmith\nwould have flung off three or four sets of donkey-shoes in one morning,\nbut you, I will be sworn, have been hammering at these for days, and they\ndo you credit--but why?--because you are no blacksmith; no, friend, your\nshoes may do for this young gentlewoman's animal, but I shouldn't like to\nhave my horses shod by you, unless at a great pinch indeed.'\n\n'Then,' said I, 'for what do you take me?'\n\n'Why, for some runaway young gentleman,' said the postilion.  'No\noffence, I hope?'\n\n'None at all; no one is offended at being taken or mistaken for a young\ngentleman, whether runaway or not; but from whence do you suppose I have\nrun away?'\n\n'Why, from college,' said the man: 'no offence?'\n\n'None whatever; and what induced me to run away from college?'\n\n'A love affair, I'll be sworn,' said the postilion.  'You had become\nacquainted with this young gentlewoman, so she and you--'\n\n'Mind how you get on, friend,' said Belle, in a deep serious tone.\n\n'Pray proceed,' said I; 'I daresay you mean no offence.'\n\n'None in the world,' said the postilion; 'all I was going to say was,\nthat you agreed to run away together, you from college, and she from\nboarding-school.  Well, there's nothing to be ashamed of in a matter like\nthat, such things are done every day by young folks in high life.'\n\n'Are you offended?' said I to Belle.\n\nBelle made no answer; but, placing her elbows on her knees, buried her\nface in her hands.\n\n'So we ran away together?' said I.\n\n'Ay, ay,' said the postilion, 'to Gretna Green, though I can't say that I\ndrove ye, though I have driven many a pair.'\n\n'And from Gretna Green we came here?'\n\n'I'll be bound you did,' said the man, 'till you could arrange matters at\nhome.'\n\n'And the horse-shoes?' said I.\n\n'The donkey-shoes you mean,' answered the postilion; 'why, I suppose you\npersuaded the blacksmith who married you to give you, before you left, a\nfew lessons in his trade.'\n\n'And we intend to stay here till we have arranged matters at home?'\n\n'Ay, ay,' said the postilion, 'till the old people are pacified, and they\nsend you letters directed to the next post town, to be left till called\nfor, beginning with \"Dear children,\" and enclosing you each a cheque for\none hundred pounds, when you will leave this place, and go home in a\ncoach like gentlefolks, to visit your governors; I should like nothing\nbetter than to have the driving of you: and then there will be a grand\nmeeting of the two families, and after a few reproaches, the old people\nwill agree to do something handsome for the poor thoughtless things; so\nyou will have a genteel house taken for you, and an annuity allowed you.\nYou won't get much the first year, five hundred at the most, in order\nthat the old folks may let you feel that they are not altogether\nsatisfied with you, and that you are yet entirely in their power; but the\nsecond, if you don't get a cool thousand, may I catch cold, especially\nshould young madam here present a son and heir for the old people to\nfondle, destined one day to become sole heir of the two illustrious\nhouses; and then all the grand folks in the neighbourhood, who have--bless\ntheir prudent hearts!--kept rather aloof from you till then, for fear you\nshould want anything from them--I say all the carriage people in the\nneighbourhood, when they see how swimmingly matters are going on, will\ncome in shoals to visit you.'\n\n'Really,' said I, 'you are getting on swimmingly.'\n\n'Oh,' said the postilion, 'I was not a gentleman's servant nine years\nwithout learning the ways of gentry, and being able to know gentry when I\nsee them.'\n\n'And what do you say to all this?' I demanded of Belle.\n\n'Stop a moment,' interposed the postilion, 'I have one more word to\nsay:--and when you are surrounded by your comforts, keeping your nice\nlittle barouche and pair, your coachman and livery servant, and visited\nby all the carriage people in the neighbourhood--to say nothing of the\ntime when you come to the family estates on the death of the old people--I\nshouldn't wonder if now and then you look back with longing and regret to\nthe days when you lived in the damp dripping dingle, had no better\nequipage than a pony or donkey cart, and saw no better company than a\ntramper or gypsy, except once, when a poor postilion was glad to seat\nhimself at your charcoal fire.'\n\n'Pray,' said I, 'did you ever take lessons in elocution?'\n\n'Not directly,' said the postilion; 'but my old master, who was in\nParliament, did, and so did his son, who was intended to be an orator.  A\ngreat professor used to come and give them lessons, and I used to stand\nand listen, by which means I picked up a considerable quantity of what is\ncalled rhetoric.  In what I last said, I was aiming at what I have heard\nhim frequently endeavouring to teach my governors as a thing\nindispensably necessary in all oratory, a graceful\npere--pere--peregrination.'\n\n'Peroration, perhaps?'\n\n'Just so,' said the postilion; 'and now I'm sure I am not mistaken about\nyou; you have taken lessons yourself, at first hand, in the college\nvacations, and a promising pupil you were, I make no doubt.  Well, your\nfriends will be all the happier to get you back.  Has your governor much\nborough interest?'\n\n'I ask you once more,' said I, addressing myself to Belle, 'what you\nthink of the history which this good man has made for us?'\n\n'What should I think of it,' said Belle, still keeping her face buried in\nher hands, 'but that it is mere nonsense?'\n\n'Nonsense!' said the postilion.\n\n'Yes,' said the girl, 'and you know it.'\n\n'May my leg always ache, if I do,' said the postilion, patting his leg\nwith his hand; 'will you persuade me that this young man has never been\nat college?'\n\n'I have never been at college, but--'\n\n'Ay, ay,' said the postilion, 'but--'\n\n'I have been to the best schools in Britain, to say nothing of a\ncelebrated one in Ireland.'\n\n'Well, then, it comes to the same thing,' said the postilion, 'or perhaps\nyou know more than if you had been at college--and your governor--'\n\n'My governor, as you call him,' said I, 'is dead.'\n\n'And his borough interest?'\n\n'My father had no borough interest,' said I; 'had he possessed any, he\nwould perhaps not have died, as he did, honourably poor.'\n\n'No, no,' said the postilion, 'if he had had borough interest, he\nwouldn't have been poor, nor honourable, though perhaps a right\nhonourable.  However, with your grand education and genteel manners, you\nmade all right at last by persuading this noble young gentlewoman to run\naway from boarding-school with you.'\n\n'I was never at boarding-school,' said Belle, 'unless you call--'\n\n'Ay, ay,' said the postilion, 'boarding-school is vulgar, I know: I beg\nyour pardon, I ought to have called it academy, or by some other much\nfiner name--you were in something much greater than a boarding-school.'\n\n'There you are right,' said Belle, lifting up her head and looking the\npostilion full in the face by the light of the charcoal fire, 'for I was\nbred in the workhouse.'\n\n'Wooh!' said the postilion.\n\n'It is true that I am of good--'\n\n'Ay, ay,' said the postilion, 'let us hear--'\n\n'Of good blood,' continued Belle; 'my name is Berners, Isopel Berners,\nthough my parents were unfortunate.  Indeed, with respect to blood, I\nbelieve I am of better blood than the young man.'\n\n'There you are mistaken,' said I; 'by my father's side I am of Cornish\nblood, and by my mother's of brave French Protestant extraction.  Now,\nwith respect to the blood of my father--and to be descended well on the\nfather's side is the principal thing--it is the best blood in the world,\nfor the Cornish blood, as the proverb says--'\n\n'I don't care what the proverb says,' said Belle; 'I say my blood is the\nbest--my name is Berners, Isopel Berners--it was my mother's name, and is\nbetter, I am sure, than any you bear, whatever that may be; and though\nyou say that the descent on the fathers side is the principal thing--and\nI know why you say so,' she added with some excitement--'I say that\ndescent on the mother's side is of most account, because the mother--'\n\n'Just come from Gretna Green, and already quarrelling!' said the\npostilion.\n\n'We do not come from Gretna Green,' said Belle.\n\n'Ah, I had forgot,' said the postilion; 'none but great people go to\nGretna Green.  Well, then, from church, and already quarrelling about\nfamily, just like two great people.'\n\n'We have never been to church,' said Belle; 'and to prevent any more\nguessing on your part, it will be as well for me to tell you, friend,\nthat I am nothing to the young man, and he, of course, nothing to me.  I\nam a poor travelling girl, born in a workhouse: journeying on my\noccasions with certain companions, I came to this hollow, where my\ncompany quarrelled with the young man, who had settled down here, as he\nhad a right to do if he pleased; and not being able to drive him out,\nthey went away after quarrelling with me, too, for not choosing to side\nwith them; so I stayed here along with the young man, there being room\nfor us both, and the place being as free to me as to him.'\n\n'And in order that you may be no longer puzzled with respect to myself,'\nsaid I; 'I will give you a brief outline of my history.  I am the son of\nhonourable parents, who gave me a first-rate education, as far as\nliterature and languages went, with which education I endeavoured, on the\ndeath of my father, to advance myself to wealth and reputation in the big\ncity; but failing in the attempt, I conceived a disgust for the busy\nworld, and determined to retire from it.  After wandering about for some\ntime, and meeting with various adventures, in one of which I contrived to\nobtain a pony, cart, and certain tools used by smiths and tinkers, I came\nto this place, where I amused myself with making horse-shoes, or rather\npony-shoes, having acquired the art of wielding the hammer and tongs from\na strange kind of smith--not him of Gretna Green--whom I knew in my\nchildhood.  And here I lived, doing harm to no one, quite lonely and\nsolitary, till one fine morning the premises were visited by this young\ngentlewoman and her companions.  She did herself anything but justice\nwhen she said that her companions quarrelled with her because she would\nnot side with them against me; they quarrelled with her because she came\nmost heroically to my assistance as I was on the point of being murdered;\nand she forgot to tell you that, after they had abandoned her, she stood\nby me in the--dark hour, comforting and cheering me, when unspeakable\ndread, to which I am occasionally subject, took possession of my mind.\nShe says she is nothing to me, even as I am nothing to her.  I am of\ncourse nothing to her, but she is mistaken in thinking she is nothing to\nme.  I entertain the highest regard and admiration for her, being\nconvinced that I might search the whole world in vain for a nature more\nheroic and devoted.'\n\n'And for my part,' said Belle, with a sob, 'a more quiet agreeable\npartner in a place like this I would not wish to have; it is true he has\nstrange ways, and frequently puts words into my mouth very difficult to\nutter, but--but--' and here she buried her face once more in her hands.\n\n'Well,' said the postilion, 'I have been mistaken about you; that is, not\naltogether, but in part.  You are not rich folks, it seems, but you are\nnot common people, and that I could have sworn.  What I call a shame is,\nthat some people I have known are not in your place and you in theirs,\nyou with their estates and borough interest, they in this dingle with\nthese carts and animals; but there is no help for these things.  Were I\nthe great Mumbo Jumbo above, I would endeavour to manage matters better;\nbut being a simple postilion, glad to earn three shillings a day, I can't\nbe expected to do much.'\n\n'Who is Mumbo Jumbo?' said I.\n\n'Ah!' said the postilion, 'I see there may be a thing or two I know\nbetter than yourself.  Mumbo Jumbo is a god of the black coast, to which\npeople go for ivory and gold.'\n\n'Were you ever there?' I demanded.\n\n'No,' said the postilion, 'but I heard plenty of Mumbo Jumbo when I was a\nboy.'\n\n'I wish you would tell us something about yourself.  I believe that your\nown real history would prove quite as entertaining, if not more, than\nthat which you imagined about us.'\n\n'I am rather tired,' said the postilion, 'and my leg is rather\ntroublesome.  I should be glad to try to sleep upon one of your blankets.\nHowever, as you wish to hear something about me, I shall be happy to\noblige you; but your fire is rather low, and this place is chilly.'\n\nThereupon I arose, and put fresh charcoal on the pan; then taking it\noutside the tent, with a kind of fan which I had fashioned, I fanned the\ncoals into a red glow, and continued doing so until the greater part of\nthe noxious gas, which the coals are in the habit of exhaling, was\nexhausted.  I then brought it into the tent and reseated myself,\nscattering over the coals a small portion of sugar.  'No bad smell,' said\nthe postilion; 'but upon the whole I think I like the smell of tobacco\nbetter; and with your permission I will once more light my pipe.'\n\nThereupon he relighted his pipe; and, after taking two or three whiffs,\nbegan in the following manner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVIII\n\n\nAn exordium--Fine ships--High Barbary captains--Free-born\nEnglishmen--Monstrous figure--Swashbuckler--The grand coaches--The\nfootmen--A travelling expedition--Black Jack--Nelson's cannon--Pharaoh's\nbutler--A diligence--Two passengers--Sharking priest--Virgilio--Lessons\nin Italian--Two opinions--Holy Mary--Priestly confederates--Methodist\nchapel--Veturini--Some of our party--Like a sepulchre--All for\nthemselves.\n\n'I am a poor postilion, as you see; yet, as I have seen a thing or two\nand heard a thing or two of what is going on in the world, perhaps what I\nhave to tell you connected with myself may not prove altogether\nuninteresting.  Now, my friends, this manner of opening a story is what\nthe man who taught rhetoric would call a hex--hex--'\n\n'Exordium,' said I.\n\n'Just so,' said the postilion; 'I treated you to a per--per--peroration\nsome time ago, so that I have contrived to put the cart before the horse,\nas the Irish orators frequently do in the honourable House, in whose\nspeeches, especially those who have taken lessons in rhetoric, the\nper--per--what's the word?--frequently goes before the exordium.\n\n'I was born in the neighbouring county; my father was land-steward to a\nsquire of about a thousand a year.  My father had two sons, of whom I am\nthe youngest by some years.  My elder brother was of a spirited roving\ndisposition, and for fear that he should turn out what is generally\ntermed ungain, my father determined to send him to sea: so once upon a\ntime, when my brother was about fifteen, he took him to the great seaport\nof the county, where he apprenticed him to a captain of one of the ships\nwhich trade to the high Barbary coast.  Fine ships they were, I have\nheard say, more than thirty in number, and all belonging to a wonderful\ngreat gentleman, who had once been a parish boy, but had contrived to\nmake an immense fortune by trading to that coast for gold-dust, ivory,\nand other strange articles; and for doing so, I mean for making a\nfortune, had been made a knight baronet.  So my brother went to the high\nBarbary shore, on board the fine vessel, and in about a year returned and\ncame to visit us; he repeated the voyage several times, always coming to\nsee his parents on his return.  Strange stories he used to tell us of\nwhat he had been witness to on the high Barbary coast, both off shore and\non.  He said that the fine vessel in which he sailed was nothing better\nthan a painted hell; that the captain was a veritable fiend, whose grand\ndelight was in tormenting his men, especially when they were sick, as\nthey frequently were, there being always fever on the high Barbary coast;\nand that though the captain was occasionally sick himself, his being so\nmade no difference, or rather it did make a difference, though for the\nworse, he being when sick always more inveterate and malignant than at\nother times.  He said that once, when he himself was sick, his captain\nhad pitched his face all over, which exploit was much applauded by the\nother high Barbary captains--all of whom, from what my brother said,\nappeared to be of much the same disposition as my brother's captain,\ntaking wonderful delight in tormenting the crews, and doing all manner of\nterrible things.  My brother frequently said that nothing whatever\nprevented him from running away from his ship, and never returning, but\nthe hope he entertained of one day being captain himself, and able to\ntorment people in his turn, which he solemnly vowed he would do, as a\nkind of compensation for what he himself had undergone.  And if things\nwere going on in a strange way off the high Barbary shore amongst those\nwho came there to trade, they were going on in a way yet stranger with\nthe people who lived upon it.\n\n'Oh the strange ways of the black men who lived on that shore, of which\nmy brother used to tell us at home--selling their sons, daughters, and\nservants for slaves, and the prisoners taken in battle, to the Spanish\ncaptains, to be carried to Havannah, and when there, sold at a profit,\nthe idea of which, my brother said, went to the hearts of our own\ncaptains, who used to say what a hard thing it was that free-born\nEnglishmen could not have a hand in the traffic, seeing that it was\nforbidden by the laws of their country; talking fondly of the good old\ntimes when their forefathers used to carry slaves to Jamaica and\nBarbadoes, realising immense profit, besides the pleasure of hearing\ntheir shrieks on the voyage; and then the superstitions of the blacks,\nwhich my brother used to talk of; their sharks' teeth, their wisps of\nfowls' feathers, their half-baked pots full of burnt bones, of which they\nused to make what they called fetish, and bow down to, and ask favours\nof, and then, perhaps, abuse and strike, provided the senseless rubbish\ndid not give them what they asked for; and then, above all, Mumbo Jumbo,\nthe grand fetish master, who lived somewhere in the woods, and who used\nto come out every now and then with his fetish companions; a monstrous\nfigure, all wound round with leaves and branches, so as to be quite\nindistinguishable, and, seating himself on the high seat in the villages,\nreceive homage from the people, and also gifts and offerings, the most\nvaluable of which were pretty damsels, and then betake himself back\nagain, with his followers, into the woods.  Oh the tales that my brother\nused to tell us of the high Barbary shore!  Poor fellow! what became of\nhim I can't say; the last time he came back from a voyage, he told us\nthat his captain, as soon as he had brought his vessel to port and\nsettled with his owner, drowned himself off the quay, in a fit of the\nhorrors, which it seems high Barbary captains, after a certain number of\nyears, are much subject to.  After staying about a month with us, he went\nto sea again, with another captain; and, bad as the old one had been, it\nappears the new one was worse, for, unable to bear his treatment, my\nbrother left his ship off the high Barbary shore, and ran away up the\ncountry.  Some of his comrades, whom we afterwards saw, said that there\nwere various reports about him on the shore; one that he had taken on\nwith Mumbo Jumbo, and was serving him in his house in the woods, in the\ncapacity of swashbuckler, or life-guardsman; another, that he was gone in\nquest of a mighty city in the heart of the negro country; another, that\nin swimming a stream he had been devoured by an alligator.  Now, these\ntwo last reports were bad enough; the idea of their flesh and blood being\nbit asunder by a ravenous fish was sad enough to my poor parents; and not\nvery comfortable was the thought of his sweltering over the hot sands in\nquest of the negro city; but the idea of their son, their eldest child,\nserving Mumbo Jumbo as swashbuckler was worst of all, and caused my poor\nparents to shed many a scalding tear.\n\n'I stayed at home with my parents until I was about eighteen, assisting\nmy father in various ways.  I then went to live at the Squire's, partly\nas groom, partly as footman.  After living in the country some time, I\nattended the family in a trip of six weeks which they made to London.\nWhilst there, happening to have some words with an old ill-tempered\ncoachman, who had been for a great many years in the family, my master\nadvised me to leave, offering to recommend me to a family of his\nacquaintance who were in need of a footman.  I was glad to accept his\noffer, and in a few days went to my new place.  My new master was one of\nthe great gentry, a baronet in Parliament, and possessed of an estate of\nabout twenty thousand a year; his family consisted of his lady, a son, a\nfine young man just coming of age, and two very sweet amiable daughters.\nI liked this place much better than my first, there was so much more\npleasant noise and bustle--so much more grand company, and so many more\nopportunities of improving myself.  Oh, how I liked to see the grand\ncoaches drive up to the door, with the grand company; and though, amidst\nthat company, there were some who did not look very grand, there were\nothers, and not a few, who did.  Some of the ladies quite captivated me;\nthere was the Marchioness of--in particular.  This young lady puts me\nmuch in mind of her; it is true, the Marchioness, as I saw her then, was\nabout fifteen years older than this young gentlewoman is now, and not so\ntall by some inches, but she had the very same hair, and much the same\nneck and shoulders--no offence, I hope?  And then some of the young\ngentlemen, with their cool, haughty, care-for-nothing looks, struck me as\nbeing very fine fellows.  There was one in particular, whom I frequently\nused to stare at, not altogether unlike some one I have seen\nhereabouts--he had a slight cast in his eye, and . . . but I won't enter\ninto every particular.  And then the footmen!  Oh, how those footmen\nhelped to improve me with their conversation.  Many of them could\nconverse much more glibly than their masters, and appeared to have much\nbetter taste.  At any rate, they seldom approved of what their masters\ndid.  I remember being once with one in the gallery of the play-house,\nwhen something of Shakspeare's was being performed: some one in the first\ntier of boxes was applauding very loudly.  \"That's my fool of a\ngovernor,\" said he; \"he is weak enough to like Shakspeare--I don't;--he's\nso confoundedly low, but he won't last long--going down.  Shakspeare\nculminated\"--I think that was the word--\"culminated some time ago.\"\n\n'And then the professor of elocution, of whom my governors used to take\nlessons, and of which lessons I had my share, by listening behind the\ndoor; but for that professor of elocution I should not be able to round\nmy periods--an expression of his--in the manner I do.\n\n'After I had been three years at this place my mistress died.  Her death,\nhowever, made no great alteration in my way of living, the family\nspending their winters in London, and their summers at their old seat in\nS--- as before.  At last, the young ladies, who had not yet got husbands,\nwhich was strange enough, seeing, as I told you before, they were very\namiable, proposed to our governor a travelling expedition abroad.  The\nold baronet consented, though young master was much against it, saying\nthey would all be much better at home.  As the girls persisted, however,\nhe at last withdrew his opposition, and even promised to follow them as\nsoon as his parliamentary duties would permit; for he was just got into\nParliament, and, like most other young members, thought that nothing\ncould be done in the House without him.  So the old gentleman and the two\nyoung ladies set off, taking me with them, and a couple of ladies' maids\nto wait upon them.  First of all, we went to Paris, where we continued\nthree months, the old baronet and the ladies going to see the various\nsights of the city and the neighbourhood, and I attending them.  They\nsoon got tired of sight-seeing, and of Paris too; and so did I.  However,\nthey still continued there, in order, I believe, that the young ladies\nmight lay in a store of French finery.  I should have passed my idle time\nat Paris, of which I had plenty after the sight-seeing was over, very\nunpleasantly, but for Black Jack.  Eh! did you never hear of Black Jack?\nAh! if you had ever been an English servant in Paris, you would have\nknown Black Jack; not an English gentleman's servant who has been at\nParis for this last ten years but knows Black Jack and his ordinary.  A\nstrange fellow he was--of what country no one could exactly say--for as\nfor judging from speech, that was impossible, Jack speaking all languages\nequally ill.  Some said he came direct from Satan's kitchen, and that\nwhen he gives up keeping ordinary, he will return there again, though the\ngenerally-received opinion at Paris was, that he was at one time butler\nto King Pharaoh; and that, after lying asleep for four thousand years in\na place called the Kattycombs, he was awaked by the sound of Nelson's\ncannon at the battle of the Nile, and going to the shore, took on with\nthe admiral, and became, in course of time, ship steward; and that after\nNelson's death he was captured by the French, on board one of whose\nvessels he served in a somewhat similar capacity till the peace, when he\ncame to Paris, and set up an ordinary for servants, sticking the name of\nKatcomb over the door, in allusion to the place where he had his long\nsleep.  But, whatever his origin was, Jack kept his own counsel, and\nappeared to care nothing for what people said about him, or called him.\nYes, I forgot, there was one name he would not be called, and that was\n\"Portuguese.\"  I once saw Black Jack knock down a coachman, six foot\nhigh, who called him black-faced Portuguese.  \"Any name but dat, you\nshab,\" said Black Jack, who was a little round fellow, of about five feet\ntwo; \"I would not stand to be called Portuguese by Nelson himself.\"  Jack\nwas rather fond of talking about Nelson, and hearing people talk about\nhim, so that it is not improbable that he may have sailed with him; and\nwith respect to his having been King Pharaoh's butler, all I have to say\nis, I am not disposed to give the downright lie to the report. Jack was\nalways ready to do a kind turn to a poor servant out of place, and has\noften been known to assist such as were in prison, which charitable\ndisposition he perhaps acquired from having lost a good place himself,\nhaving seen the inside of a prison, and known the want of a meal's\nvictuals, all which trials King Pharaoh's butler underwent, so he may\nhave been that butler; at any rate, I have known positive conclusions\ncome to on no better premisses, if indeed as good.  As for the story of\nhis coming direct from Satan's kitchen, I place no confidence in it at\nall, as Black Jack had nothing of Satan about him but blackness, on which\naccount he was called Black Jack.  Nor am I disposed to give credit to a\nreport that his hatred of the Portuguese arose from some ill treatment\nwhich he had once experienced when on shore, at Lisbon, from certain\ngentlewomen of the place, but rather conclude that it arose from an\nopinion he entertained that the Portuguese never paid their debts, one of\nthe ambassadors of that nation, whose house he had served, having left\nParis several thousand francs in his debt.  This is all that I have to\nsay about Black Jack, without whose funny jokes and good ordinary I\nshould have passed my time in Paris in a very disconsolate manner.\n\n'After we had been at Paris between two and three months, we left it in\nthe direction of Italy, which country the family had a great desire to\nsee.  After travelling a great many days in a thing which, though called\na diligence, did not exhibit much diligence, we came to a great big town,\nseated around a nasty salt-water bason, connected by a narrow passage\nwith the sea.  Here we were to embark; and so we did as soon as possible,\nglad enough to get away--at least I was, and so I make no doubt were the\nrest, for such a place for bad smells I never was in.  It seems all the\ndrains and sewers of the place run into that same salt bason, voiding\ninto it all their impurities, which, not being able to escape into the\nsea in any considerable quantity, owing to the narrowness of the\nentrance, there accumulate, filling the whole atmosphere with these same\noutrageous scents, on which account the town is a famous lodging-house of\nthe plague.  The ship in which we embarked was bound for a place in Italy\ncalled Naples, where we were to stay some time.  The voyage was rather a\nlazy one, the ship not being moved by steam; for at the time of which I\nam speaking, some five years ago, steam-ships were not so plentiful as\nnow.  There were only two passengers in the grand cabin, where my\ngovernor and his daughters were, an Italian lady and a priest.  Of the\nlady I have not much to say; she appeared to be a quiet respectable\nperson enough, and after our arrival at Naples I neither saw nor heard\nanything more of her; but of the priest I shall have a good deal to say\nin the sequel (that, by the bye, is a word I learnt from the professor of\nrhetoric), and it would have been well for our family had they never met\nhim.\n\n'On the third day of the voyage the priest came to me, who was rather\nunwell with sea-sickness, which he, of course, felt nothing of--that kind\nof people being never affected like others.  He was a finish-looking man\nof about forty-five, but had something strange in his eyes, which I have\nsince thought denoted that all was not right in a certain place called\nthe heart.  After a few words of condolence, in a broken kind of English,\nhe asked me various questions about our family; and I, won by his seeming\nkindness, told him all I knew about them--of which communicativeness I\nafterwards very much repented.  As soon as he had got out of me all he\ndesired, he left me; and I observed that during the rest of the voyage he\nwas wonderfully attentive to our governor, and yet more to the young\nladies.  Both, however, kept him rather at a distance; the young ladies\nwere reserved, and once or twice I heard our governor cursing him between\nhis teeth for a sharking priest.  The priest, however, was not\ndisconcerted, and continued his attentions, which in a little time\nproduced an effect, so that, by the time we landed at Naples, our great\nfolks had conceived a kind of liking for the man, and when they took\ntheir leave invited him to visit them, which he promised to do.  We hired\na grand house or palace at Naples; it belonged to a poor kind of prince,\nwho was glad enough to let it to our governor, and also his servants and\ncarriages; and glad enough were the poor servants, for they got from us\nwhat they never got from the prince--plenty of meat and money; and glad\nenough, I make no doubt, were the horses for the provender we gave them;\nand I daresay the coaches were not sorry to be cleaned and furbished up.\nWell, we went out and came in; going to see the sights, and returning.\nAmongst other things we saw was the burning mountain, and the tomb of a\ncertain sorcerer called Virgilio, who made witch rhymes, by which he\ncould raise the dead.  Plenty of people came to see us, both English and\nItalians, and amongst the rest the priest.  He did not come amongst the\nfirst, but allowed us to settle and become a little quiet before he\nshowed himself; and after a day or two he paid us another visit, then\nanother, till at last his visits were daily.\n\n'I did not like that Jack Priest; so I kept my eye upon all his motions.\nLord! how that Jack Priest did curry favour with our governor and the two\nyoung ladies; and he curried, and curried, till he had got himself into\nfavour with the governor, and more especially with the two young ladies,\nof whom their father was doatingly fond.  At last the ladies took lessons\nin Italian of the priest, a language in which he was said to be a grand\nproficient, and of which they had hitherto known but very little; and\nfrom that time his influence over them, and consequently over the old\ngovernor, increased, till the tables were turned, and he no longer\ncurried favour with them, but they with him--yes, as true as my leg\naches, the young ladies curried, and the old governor curried favour with\nthat same priest; when he was with them, they seemed almost to hang on\nhis lips, that is, the young ladies; and as for the old governor, he\nnever contradicted him, and when the fellow was absent, which, by the\nbye, was not often, it was, \"Father so-and-so said this,\" and \"Father so-\nand-so said that\"; \"Father so-and-so thinks we should do so-and-so, or\nthat we should not do so-and-so.\"  I at first thought that he must have\ngiven them something, some philtre or the like, but one of the English\nmaid-servants, who had a kind of respect for me, and who saw much more\nbehind the scenes than I did, informed me that he was continually\ninstilling strange notions into their heads, striving, by every possible\nmethod, to make them despise the religion of their own land, and take up\nthat of the foreign country in which they were.  And sure enough, in a\nlittle time, the girls had altogether left off going to an English\nchapel, and were continually visiting places of Italian worship.  The old\ngovernor, it is true, still went to his church, but he appeared to be\nhesitating between two opinions; and once, when he was at dinner, he said\nto two or three English friends that, since he had become better\nacquainted with it, he had conceived a much more favourable opinion of\nthe Catholic religion than he had previously entertained.  In a word, the\npriest ruled the house, and everything was done according to his will and\npleasure; by degrees he persuaded the young ladies to drop their English\nacquaintances, whose place he supplied with Italians, chiefly females.  My\npoor old governor would not have had a person to speak to--for he never\ncould learn the language--but for two or three Englishmen who used to\ncome occasionally and take a bottle with him in a summer-house, whose\ncompany he could not be persuaded to resign, notwithstanding the\nentreaties of his daughters, instigated by the priest, whose grand\nendeavour seemed to be to render the minds of all three foolish, for his\nown ends.  And if he was busy above stairs with the governor, there was\nanother busy below with us poor English servants, a kind of subordinate\npriest, a low Italian; as he could speak no language but his own, he was\ncontinually jabbering to us in that, and by hearing him the maids and\nmyself contrived to pick up a good deal of the language, so that we\nunderstood most that was said, and could speak it very fairly; and the\nthemes of his jabber were the beauty and virtues of one whom he called\nHoly Mary, and the power and grandeur of one whom he called the Holy\nFather; and he told us that we should shortly have an opportunity of\nseeing the Holy Father, who could do anything he liked with Holy Mary: in\nthe meantime we had plenty of opportunities of seeing Holy Mary, for in\nevery church, chapel, and convent to which we were taken, there was an\nimage of Holy Mary, who, if the images were dressed at all in her\nfashion, must have been very fond of short petticoats and tinsel, and\nwho, if those said figures at all resembled her in face, could scarcely\nhave been half as handsome as either of my two fellow-servants, not to\nspeak of the young ladies.\n\n'Now it happened that one of the female servants was much taken with what\nshe saw and heard, and gave herself up entirely to the will of the\nsubordinate, who had quite as much dominion over her as his superior had\nover the ladies; the other maid, however, the one who had a kind of\nrespect for me, was not so easily besotted; she used to laugh at what she\nsaw, and at what the fellow told her, and from her I learnt that amongst\nother things intended by these priestly confederates was robbery; she\nsaid that the poor old governor had already been persuaded by his\ndaughters to put more than a thousand pounds into the superior priest's\nhands for purposes of charity and religion, as was said, and that the\nsubordinate one had already inveigled her fellow-servant out of every\npenny which she had saved from her wages, and had endeavoured likewise to\nobtain what money she herself had, but in vain.  With respect to myself,\nthe fellow shortly after made an attempt towards obtaining a hundred\ncrowns, of which, by some means, he knew me to be in possession, telling\nme what a meritorious thing it was to give one's superfluities for the\npurposes of religion.  \"That is true,\" said I, \"and if, after my return\nto my native country, I find I have anything which I don't want myself, I\nwill employ it in helping to build a Methodist chapel.\"\n\n'By the time that the three months were expired for which we had hired\nthe palace of the needy Prince, the old governor began to talk of\nreturning to England, at least of leaving Italy.  I believe he had become\nfrightened at the calls which were continually being made upon him for\nmoney; for after all, you know, if there is a sensitive part of a man's\nwearing apparel, it is his breeches pocket; but the young ladies could\nnot think of leaving dear Italy and the dear priest; and then they had\nseen nothing of the country, they had only seen Naples; before leaving\ndear Italia they must see more of the country and the cities; above all,\nthey must see a place which they called the Eternal City, or some similar\nnonsensical name; and they persisted so that the poor governor permitted\nthem, as usual, to have their way; and it was decided what route they\nshould take--that is, the priest was kind enough to decide for them, and\nwas also kind enough to promise to go with them part of the route, as far\nas a place where there was a wonderful figure of Holy Mary, which the\npriest said it was highly necessary for them to see before visiting the\nEternal City: so we left Naples in hired carriages, driven by fellows\nthey call veturini, cheating, drunken dogs, I remember they were.  Besides\nour own family there was the priest and his subordinate, and a couple of\nhired lackeys.  We were several days upon the journey, travelling through\na very wild country, which the ladies pretended to be delighted with, and\nwhich the governor cursed on account of the badness of the roads; and\nwhen we came to any particularly wild spot we used to stop, in order to\nenjoy the scenery, as the ladies said; and then we would spread a horse-\ncloth on the ground, and eat bread and cheese, and drink wine of the\ncountry.  And some of the holes and corners in which we bivouacked, as\nthe ladies called it, were something like this place where we are now, so\nthat when I came down here it put me in mind of them.  At last we arrived\nat the place where was the holy image.\n\n'We went to the house or chapel in which the holy image was kept--a\nfrightful, ugly black figure of Holy Mary, dressed in her usual way; and\nafter we had stared at the figure, and some of our party had bowed down\nto it, we were shown a great many things which were called holy relics,\nwhich consisted of thumb-nails, and fore-nails, and toe-nails, and hair,\nand teeth, and a feather or two, and a mighty thigh-bone, but whether of\na man or a camel I can't say; all of which things, I was told, if\nproperly touched and handled, had mighty power to cure all kinds of\ndisorders.  And as we went from the holy house we saw a man in a state of\ngreat excitement: he was foaming at the mouth, and cursing the holy image\nand all its household, because, after he had worshipped it and made\nofferings to it, and besought it to assist him in a game of chance which\nhe was about to play, it had left him in the lurch, allowing him to lose\nall his money.  And when I thought of all the rubbish I had seen, and the\npurposes which it was applied to, in conjunction with the rage of the\nlosing gamester at the deaf and dumb image, I could not help comparing\nthe whole with what my poor brother used to tell me of the superstitious\npractices of the blacks on the high Barbary shore, and their occasional\nrage and fury at the things they worshipped; and I said to myself, If all\nthis here doesn't smell of fetish, may I smell fetid.\n\n'At this place the priest left us, returning to Naples with his\nsubordinate, on some particular business I suppose.  It was, however,\nagreed that he should visit us at the Holy City.  We did not go direct to\nthe Holy City, but bent our course to two or three other cities which the\nfamily were desirous of seeing; but as nothing occurred to us in these\nplaces of any particular interest, I shall take the liberty of passing\nthem by in silence.  At length we arrived at the Eternal City: an immense\ncity it was, looking as if it had stood for a long time, and would stand\nfor a long time still; compared with it, London would look like a mere\nassemblage of bee-skeps; however, give me the bee-skeps with their merry\nhum and bustle, and life and honey, rather than that huge town, which\nlooked like a sepulchre, where there was no life, no busy hum, no bees,\nbut a scanty sallow population, intermixed with black priests, white\npriests, gray priests; and though I don't say there was no honey in the\nplace, for I believe there was, I am ready to take my Bible oath that it\nwas not made there, and that the priests kept it all for themselves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIX\n\n\nA cloister--Half English--New acquaintance--Mixed liquors--Turning\nPapist--Purposes of charity--Foreign religion--Melancholy--Elbowing and\npushing--Outlandish sight--The figure--I don't care for\nyou--Merry-andrews--One good--Religion of my country--Fellow of spirit--A\ndispute--The next morning--Female doll--Proper dignity--Fetish country.\n\n'The day after our arrival,' continued the postilion, 'I was sent, under\nthe guidance of a lackey of the place, with a letter, which the priest,\nwhen he left, had given us for a friend of his in the Eternal City.  We\nwent to a large house, and on ringing were admitted by a porter into a\ncloister, where I saw some ill-looking, shabby young fellows walking\nabout, who spoke English to one another.  To one of these the porter\ndelivered the letter, and the young fellow, going away, presently\nreturned and told me to follow him; he led me into a large room where,\nbehind a table on which were various papers and a thing which they call,\nin that country, a crucifix, sat a man in a kind of priestly dress.  The\nlad having opened the door for me, shut it behind me, and went away.  The\nman behind the table was so engaged in reading the letter which I had\nbrought, that at first he took no notice of me; he had red hair, a kind\nof half-English countenance, and was seemingly about five-and-thirty.\nAfter a little time he laid the letter down, appeared to consider a\nmoment, and then opened his mouth with a strange laugh, not a loud laugh,\nfor I heard nothing but a kind of hissing deep down the throat; all of a\nsudden, however, perceiving me, he gave a slight start, but, instantly\nrecovering himself, he inquired in English concerning the health of the\nfamily, and where we lived: on my delivering him a card, he bade me\ninform my master and the ladies that in the course of the day he would do\nhimself the honour of waiting upon them.  He then arose and opened the\ndoor for me to depart.  The man was perfectly civil and courteous, but I\ndid not like that strange laugh of his after having read the letter.  He\nwas as good as his word, and that same day paid us a visit.  It was now\narranged that we should pass the winter in Rome--to my great annoyance,\nfor I wished to return to my native land, being heartily tired of\neverything connected with Italy.  I was not, however, without hope that\nour young master would shortly arrive, when I trusted that matters, as\nfar as the family were concerned, would be put on a better footing.  In a\nfew days our new acquaintance, who, it seems, was a mongrel Englishman,\nhad procured a house for our accommodation; it was large enough, but not\nnear so pleasant as that we had at Naples, which was light and airy, with\na large garden.  This was a dark gloomy structure in a narrow street,\nwith a frowning church beside it; it was not far from the place where our\nnew friend lived, and its being so was probably the reason why he\nselected it.  It was furnished partly with articles which we bought, and\npartly with those which we hired.  We lived something in the same way as\nat Naples; but though I did not much like Naples, I yet liked it better\nthan this place, which was so gloomy.  Our new acquaintance made himself\nas agreeable as he could, conducting the ladies to churches and convents,\nand frequently passing the afternoon drinking with the governor, who was\nfond of a glass of brandy and water and a cigar, as the new acquaintance\nalso was--no, I remember, he was fond of gin and water, and did not\nsmoke.  I don't think he had so much influence over the young ladies as\nthe other priest, which was, perhaps, owing to his not being so\ngood-looking; but I am sure he had more influence with the governor,\nowing, doubtless, to his bearing him company in drinking mixed liquors,\nwhich the other priest did not do.\n\n'He was a strange fellow, that same new acquaintance of ours, and unlike\nall the priests I saw in that country, and I saw plenty of various\nnations; they were always upon their guard, and had their features and\nvoice modulated; but this man was subject to fits of absence, during\nwhich he would frequently mutter to himself, then, though he was\nperfectly civil to everybody, as far as words went, I observed that he\nentertained a thorough contempt for most people, especially for those\nwhom he was making dupes.  I have observed him whilst drinking with our\ngovernor, when the old man's head was turned, look at him with an air\nwhich seemed to say, \"What a thundering old fool you are\"; and at our\nyoung ladies, when their backs were turned, with a glance which said\ndistinctly enough, \"You precious pair of ninnyhammers\"; and then his\nlaugh--he had two kinds of laughs--one which you could hear, and another\nwhich you could only see.  I have seen him laugh at our governor and the\nyoung ladies, when their heads were turned away, but I heard no sound.  My\nmother had a sandy cat, which sometimes used to open its mouth wide with\na mew which nobody could hear, and the silent laugh of that red-haired\npriest used to put me wonderfully in mind of the silent mew of my\nmother's sandy-red cat.  And then the other laugh, which you could hear;\nwhat a strange laugh that was, never loud, yes, I have heard it tolerably\nloud.  He once passed near me, after having taken leave of a silly\nEnglish fellow--a limping parson of the name of Platitude, who, they\nsaid, was thinking of turning Papist, and was much in his company; I was\nstanding behind the pillar of a piazza, and as he passed he was laughing\nheartily.  O he was a strange fellow, that same red-haired acquaintance\nof ours!\n\n'After we had been at Rome about six weeks our old friend the priest of\nNaples arrived, but without his subordinate, for whose services he now\nperhaps thought that he had no occasion.  I believe he found matters in\nour family wearing almost as favourable an aspect as he could desire:\nwith what he had previously taught them and shown them at Naples and\nelsewhere, and with what the red-haired confederate had taught them and\nshown them at Rome, the poor young ladies had become quite handmaids of\nsuperstition, so that they, especially the youngest, were prepared to bow\ndown to anything, and kiss anything, however vile and ugly, provided a\npriest commanded them; and as for the old governor, what with the\ninfluence which his daughters exerted, and what with the ascendency which\nthe red-haired man had obtained over him, he dared not say his purse, far\nless his soul, was his own.  Only think of an Englishman not being master\nof his own purse!  My acquaintance, the lady's maid, assured me that, to\nher certain knowledge, he had disbursed to the red-haired man, for\npurposes of charity, as it was said, at least one thousand pounds during\nthe five weeks we had been at Rome.  She also told me that things would\nshortly be brought to a conclusion--and so indeed they were, though in a\ndifferent manner from what she and I and some other people imagined; that\nthere was to be a grand festival, and a mass, at which we were to be\npresent, after which the family were to be presented to the Holy Father,\nfor so those two priestly sharks had managed it; and then . . . she said\nshe was certain that the two ladies, and perhaps the old governor, would\nforsake the religion of their native land, taking up with that of these\nforeign regions, for so my fellow-servant expressed it, and that perhaps\nattempts might be made to induce us poor English servants to take up with\nthe foreign religion, that is herself and me, for as for our\nfellow-servant, the other maid, she wanted no inducing, being disposed\nbody and soul to go over to it.  Whereupon I swore with an oath that\nnothing should induce me to take up with the foreign religion; and the\npoor maid, my fellow-servant, bursting into tears, said that for her part\nshe would die sooner than have anything to do with it; thereupon we shook\nhands and agreed to stand by and countenance one another: and moreover,\nprovided our governors were fools enough to go over to the religion of\nthese here foreigners, we would not wait to be asked to do the like, but\nleave them at once, and make the best of our way home, even if we were\nforced to beg on the road.\n\n'At last the day of the grand festival came, and we were all to go to the\nbig church to hear the mass.  Now it happened that for some time past I\nhad been much afflicted with melancholy, especially when I got up of a\nmorning, produced by the strange manner in which I saw things going on in\nour family; and to dispel it in some degree, I had been in the habit of\ntaking a dram before breakfast.  On the morning in question, feeling\nparticularly low spirited when I thought of the foolish step our governor\nwould probably take before evening, I took two drams before breakfast;\nand after breakfast, feeling my melancholy still continuing, I took\nanother, which produced a slight effect upon my head, though I am\nconvinced nobody observed it.\n\n'Away we drove to the big church; it was a dark misty day, I remember,\nand very cold, so that if anybody had noticed my being slightly in\nliquor, I could have excused myself by saying that I had merely taken a\nglass to fortify my constitution against the weather; and of one thing I\nam certain, which is, that such an excuse would have stood me in stead\nwith our governor, who looked, I thought, as if he had taken one too; but\nI may be mistaken, and why should I notice him, seeing that he took no\nnotice of me? so away we drove to the big church, to which all the\npopulation of the place appeared to be moving.\n\n'On arriving there we dismounted, and the two priests, who were with us,\nled the family in, whilst I followed at a little distance, but quickly\nlost them amidst the throng of people.  I made my way, however, though in\nwhat direction I knew not, except it was one in which everybody seemed\nstriving, and by dint of elbowing and pushing I at last got to a place\nwhich looked like the aisle of a cathedral, where the people stood in two\nrows, a space between being kept open by certain strangely-dressed men\nwho moved up and down with rods in their hands; all were looking to the\nupper end of this place or aisle; and at the upper end, separated from\nthe people by palings like those of an altar, sat in magnificent-looking\nstalls, on the right and the left, various wonderful-looking individuals\nin scarlet dresses.  At the farther end was what appeared to be an altar,\non the left hand was a pulpit, and on the right a stall higher than any\nof the rest, where was a figure whom I could scarcely see.\n\n'I can't pretend to describe what I saw exactly, for my head, which was\nat first rather flurried, had become more so from the efforts which I had\nmade to get through the crowd; also from certain singing, which proceeded\nfrom I know not where; and, above all, from the bursts of an organ, which\nwere occasionally so loud that I thought the roof, which was painted with\nwondrous colours, would come toppling down on those below.  So there\nstood I--a poor English servant--in that outlandish place, in the midst\nof that foreign crowd, looking at that outlandish sight, hearing those\noutlandish sounds, and occasionally glancing at our party, which, by this\ntime, I distinguished at the opposite side to where I stood, but much\nnearer the place where the red figures sat.  Yes, there stood our poor\ngovernor and the sweet young ladies, and I thought they never looked so\nhandsome before; and close by them were the sharking priests, and not far\nfrom them was that idiotical parson Platitude, winking and grinning, and\noccasionally lifting up his hands as if in ecstasy at what he saw and\nheard, so that he drew upon himself the notice of the congregation.\n\n'And now an individual mounted the pulpit, and began to preach in a\nlanguage which I did not understand, but which I believe to be Latin,\naddressing himself seemingly to the figure in the stall; and when he had\nceased, there was more singing, more organ-playing, and then two men in\nrobes brought forth two things which they held up; and then the people\nbowed their heads, and our poor governor bowed his head, and the sweet\nyoung ladies bowed their heads, and the sharking priests, whilst the\nidiotical parson Platitude tried to fling himself down; and then there\nwere various evolutions withinside the pale, and the scarlet figures got\nup and sat down; and this kind of thing continued for some time.  At\nlength the figure which I had seen in the principal stall came forth and\nadvanced towards the people; an awful figure he was, a huge old man with\na sugar-loaf hat, with a sulphur-coloured dress, and holding a crook in\nhis hand like that of a shepherd; and as he advanced the people fell on\ntheir knees, our poor old governor amongst them; the sweet young ladies,\nthe sharking priests, the idiotical parson Platitude, all fell on their\nknees, and somebody or other tried to pull me on my knees; but by this\ntime I had become outrageous; all that my poor brother used to tell me of\nthe superstitions of the high Barbary shore rushed into my mind, and I\nthought they were acting them over here; above all, the idea that the\nsweet young ladies, to say nothing of my poor old governor, were, after\nthe conclusion of all this mummery, going to deliver themselves up body\nand soul into the power of that horrid-looking old man, maddened me, and,\nrushing forward into the open space, I confronted the horrible-looking\nold figure with the sugar-loaf hat, the sulphur-coloured garments, and\nshepherd's crook, and shaking my fist at his nose, I bellowed out in\nEnglish--\n\n'\"I don't care for you, old Mumbo Jumbo, though you have fetish!\"\n\n'I can scarcely tell you what occurred for some time.  I have a dim\nrecollection that hands were laid upon me, and that I struck out\nviolently left and right.  On coming to myself, I was seated on a stone\nbench in a large room, something like a guard-room, in the custody of\ncertain fellows dressed like Merry-andrews; they were bluff,\ngood-looking, wholesome fellows, very different from the sallow Italians:\nthey were looking at me attentively, and occasionally talking to each\nother in a language which sounded very like the cracking of walnuts in\nthe mouth, very different from cooing Italian.  At last one of them asked\nme in Italian what had ailed me, to which I replied, in an incoherent\nmanner, something about Mumbo Jumbo; whereupon the fellow, one of the\nbluffest of the lot, a jovial rosy-faced rascal, lifted up his right\nhand, placing it in such a manner that the lips were between the fore-\nfinger and thumb, then lifting up his right foot and drawing back his\nhead, he sucked in his breath with a hissing sound, as if to imitate one\ndrinking a hearty draught, and then slapped me on the shoulder, saying\nsomething which sounded like goot wine, goot companion, whereupon they\nall laughed, exclaiming, ya, ya, goot companion.  And now hurried into\nthe room our poor old governor, with the red-haired priest.  The first\nasked what could have induced me to behave in such a manner in such a\nplace, to which I replied that I was not going to bow down to Mumbo\nJumbo, whatever other people might do.  Whereupon my master said he\nbelieved I was mad, and the priest said he believed I was drunk; to which\nI answered that I was neither so mad nor drunk but I could distinguish\nhow the wind lay.  Whereupon they left me, and in a little time I was\ntold by the bluff-looking Merry-andrews I was at liberty to depart.  I\nbelieve the priest, in order to please my governor, interceded for me in\nhigh quarters.\n\n'But one good resulted from this affair; there was no presentation of our\nfamily to the Holy Father, for old Mumbo was so frightened by my\noutrageous looks that he was laid up for a week, as I was afterwards\ninformed.\n\n'I went home, and had scarcely been there half an hour when I was sent\nfor by the governor, who again referred to the scene in church, said that\nhe could not tolerate such scandalous behaviour, and that unless I\npromised to be more circumspect in future, he should be compelled to\ndischarge me.  I said that if he was scandalised at my behaviour in the\nchurch, I was more scandalised at all I saw going on in the family, which\nwas governed by two rascally priests, who, not content with plundering\nhim, appeared bent on hurrying the souls of us all to destruction; and\nthat with respect to discharging me, he could do so that moment, as I\nwished to go.  I believe his own reason told him that I was right, for he\nmade no direct answer, but, after looking on the ground for some time, he\ntold me to leave him.  As he did not tell me to leave the house, I went\nto my room, intending to lie down for an hour or two; but scarcely was I\nthere when the door opened, and in came the red-haired priest.  He showed\nhimself, as he always did, perfectly civil, asked me how I was, took a\nchair and sat down.  After a hem or two he entered into a long\nconversation on the excellence of what he called the Catholic religion;\ntold me that he hoped I would not set myself against the light, and\nlikewise against my interest; for that the family were about to embrace\nthe Catholic religion, and would make it worth my while to follow their\nexample.  I told him that the family might do what they pleased, but that\nI would never forsake the religion of my country for any consideration\nwhatever; that I was nothing but a poor servant, but I was not to be\nbought by base gold.  \"I admire your honourable feelings,\" said he, \"you\nshall have no gold; and as I see you are a fellow of spirit, and do not\nlike being a servant, for which I commend you, I can promise you\nsomething better.  I have a good deal of influence in this place, and if\nyou will not set your face against the light, but embrace the Catholic\nreligion, I will undertake to make your fortune.  You remember those fine\nfellows to-day who took you into custody, they are the guards of his\nHoliness.  I have no doubt that I have interest enough to procure your\nenrolment amongst them.\"  \"What,\" said I, \"become swashbuckler to Mumbo\nJumbo up here!  May I . . .\"--and here I swore--\"if I do.  The mere\npossibility of one of their children being swashbuckler to Mumbo Jumbo on\nthe high Barbary shore has always been a source of heart-breaking to my\npoor parents.  What, then, would they not undergo, if they knew for\ncertain that their other child was swashbuckler to Mumbo Jumbo up here?\"\nThereupon he asked me, even as you did some time ago, what I meant by\nMumbo Jumbo.  And I told him all I had heard about the Mumbo Jumbo of the\nhigh Barbary shore; telling him that I had no doubt that the old fellow\nup here was his brother, or nearly related to him.  The man with the red\nhair listened with the greatest attention to all I said, and when I had\nconcluded, he got up, nodded to me, and moved to the door; ere he reached\nthe door I saw his shoulders shaking, and as he closed it behind him I\nheard him distinctly laughing, to the tune of--he! he! he!\n\n'But now matters began to mend.  That same evening my young master\nunexpectedly arrived.  I believe he soon perceived that something\nextraordinary had been going on in the family.  He was for some time\ncloseted with the governor, with whom, I believe, he had a dispute; for\nmy fellow-servant, the lady's maid, informed me that she heard high\nwords.\n\n'Rather late at night the young gentleman sent for me into his room, and\nasked me various questions with respect to what had been going on, and my\nbehaviour in the church, of which he had heard something.  I told him all\nI knew with respect to the intrigues of the two priests in the family,\nand gave him a circumstantial account of all that had occurred in the\nchurch; adding that, under similar circumstances, I was ready to play the\nsame part over again.  Instead of blaming me, he commended my behaviour,\ntold me I was a fine fellow, and said he hoped that, if he wanted my\nassistance, I would stand by him: this I promised to do.  Before I left\nhim, he entreated me to inform him the very next time I saw the priests\nentering the house.\n\n'The next morning, as I was in the courtyard, where I had placed myself\nto watch, I saw the two enter and make their way up a private stair to\nthe young ladies' apartment; they were attended by a man dressed\nsomething like a priest, who bore a large box; I instantly ran to relate\nwhat I had seen to my young master.  I found him shaving.  \"I will just\nfinish what I am about,\" said he, \"and then wait upon these gentlemen.\"\nHe finished what he was about with great deliberation; then taking a\nhorsewhip, and bidding me follow him, he proceeded at once to the door of\nhis sisters' apartment: finding it fastened, he burst it open at once\nwith his foot and entered, followed by myself.  There we beheld the two\nunfortunate young ladies down on their knees before a large female doll,\ndressed up, as usual, in rags and tinsel; the two priests were standing\nnear, one on either side, with their hands uplifted, whilst the fellow\nwho brought the trumpery stood a little way down the private stair, the\ndoor of which stood open; without a moment's hesitation, my young master\nrushed forward, gave the image a cut or two with his horsewhip--then\nflying at the priests, he gave them a sound flogging, kicked them down\nthe private stair, and spurned the man, box and image after them--then\nlocking the door, he gave his sisters a fine sermon, in which he\nrepresented to them their folly in worshipping a silly wooden graven\nimage, which, though it had eyes, could see not; though it had ears,\ncould hear not; though it had hands, could not help itself; and though it\nhad feet, could not move about unless it were carried.  Oh, it was a fine\nsermon that my young master preached, and sorry I am that the Father of\nthe Fetish, old Mumbo, did not hear it.  The elder sister looked ashamed,\nbut the youngest, who was very weak, did nothing but wring her hands,\nweep and bewail the injury which had been done to the dear image.  The\nyoung man, however, without paying much regard to either of them, went to\nhis father, with whom he had a long conversation, which terminated in the\nold governor giving orders for preparations to be made for the family's\nleaving Rome and returning to England.  I believe that the old governor\nwas glad of his son's arrival, and rejoiced at the idea of getting away\nfrom Italy, where he had been so plundered and imposed upon.  The\npriests, however, made another attempt upon the poor young ladies.  By\nthe connivance of the female servant who was in their interest they found\ntheir way once more into their apartment, bringing with them the fetish\nimage, whose body they partly stripped, exhibiting upon it certain\nsanguine marks which they had daubed upon it with red paint, but which\nthey said were the result of the lashes which it had received from the\nhorsewhip.  The youngest girl believed all they said, and kissed and\nembraced the dear image; but the eldest, whose eyes had been opened by\nher brother, to whom she was much attached, behaved with proper dignity;\nfor, going to the door, she called the female servant who had a respect\nfor me, and in her presence reproached the two deceivers for their\nvarious impudent cheats, and especially for this their last attempt at\nimposition; adding that if they did not forthwith withdraw and rid her\nsister and herself of their presence, she would send word by her maid to\nher brother, who would presently take effectual means to expel them.  They\ntook the hint and departed, and we saw no more of them.\n\n'At the end of three days we departed from Rome, but the maid whom the\npriests had cajoled remained behind, and it is probable that the youngest\nof our ladies would have done the same thing if she could have had her\nown will, for she was continually raving about her image, and saying she\nshould wish to live with it in a convent; but we watched the poor thing,\nand got her on board ship.  Oh, glad was I to leave that fetish country\nand old Mumbo behind me!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER C\n\n\nNothing but gloom--Sporting character--Gouty Tory--Servants'\nClub--Politics--Reformado footman--Peroration--Good-night.\n\n'We arrived in England, and went to our country seat, but the peace and\ntranquillity of the family had been marred, and I no longer found my\nplace the pleasant one which it had formerly been; there was nothing but\ngloom in the house, for the youngest daughter exhibited signs of lunacy,\nand was obliged to be kept under confinement.  The next season I attended\nmy master, his son, and eldest daughter to London, as I had previously\ndone.  There I left them, for hearing that a young baronet, an\nacquaintance of the family, wanted a servant, I applied for the place,\nwith the consent of my masters, both of whom gave me a strong\nrecommendation; and, being approved of, I went to live with him.\n\n'My new master was what is called a sporting character, very fond of the\nturf, upon which he was not very fortunate.  He was frequently very much\nin want of money, and my wages were anything but regularly paid;\nnevertheless, I liked him very much, for he treated me more like a friend\nthan a domestic, continually consulting me as to his affairs.  At length\nhe was brought nearly to his last shifts, by backing the favourite at the\nDerby, which favourite turned out a regular brute, being found nowhere at\nthe rush.  Whereupon, he and I had a solemn consultation over fourteen\nglasses of brandy and water, and as many cigars--I mean, between us--as\nto what was to be done.  He wished to start a coach, in which event he\nwas to be driver, and I guard.  He was quite competent to drive a coach,\nbeing a first-rate whip, and I daresay I should have made a first-rate\nguard; but, to start a coach requires money, and we neither of us\nbelieved that anybody would trust us with vehicles and horses, so that\nidea was laid aside.  We then debated as to whether or not he should go\ninto the Church; but to go into the Church--at any rate to become a dean\nor bishop, which would have been our aim--it is necessary for a man to\npossess some education; and my master, although he had been at the best\nschool in England, that is, the most expensive, and also at College, was\nalmost totally illiterate, so we let the Church scheme follow that of the\ncoach.  At last, bethinking me that he was tolerably glib at the tongue,\nas most people are who are addicted to the turf, also a great master of\nslang; remembering also that he had a crabbed old uncle, who had some\nborough interest, I proposed that he should get into the House, promising\nin one fortnight to qualify him to make a figure in it, by certain\nlessons which I would give him.  He consented; and during the next\nfortnight I did little else than give him lessons in elocution, following\nto a tittle the method of the great professor, which I had picked up,\nlistening behind the door.  At the end of that period we paid a visit to\nhis relation, an old gouty Tory, who at first received us very coolly.  My\nmaster, however, by flattering a predilection of his for Billy Pitt, soon\nwon his affections so much that he promised to bring him into Parliament;\nand in less than a month was as good as his word.  My master, partly by\nhis own qualifications, and partly by the assistance which he had\nderived, and still occasionally derived, from me, cut a wonderful figure\nin the House, and was speedily considered one of the most promising\nspeakers; he was always a good hand at promising--he is at present, I\nbelieve, a Cabinet minister.\n\n'But as he got up in the world he began to look down on me.  I believe he\nwas ashamed of the obligation under which he lay to me; and at last,\nrequiring no further hints as to oratory from a poor servant like me, he\ntook an opportunity of quarrelling with me and discharging me.  However,\nas he had still some grace, he recommended me to a gentleman with whom,\nsince he had attached himself to politics, he had formed an acquaintance,\nthe editor of a grand Tory Review.  I lost caste terribly amongst the\nservants for entering the service of a person connected with a profession\nso mean as literature; and it was proposed at the Servants' Club, in Park\nLane, to eject me from that society.  The proposition, however, was not\ncarried into effect, and I was permitted to show myself among them,\nthough few condescended to take much notice of me.  My master was one of\nthe best men in the world, but also one of the most sensitive.  On his\nveracity being impugned by the editor of a newspaper, he called him out,\nand shot him through the arm.  Though servants are seldom admirers of\ntheir masters, I was a great admirer of mine, and eager to follow his\nexample.  The day after the encounter, on my veracity being impugned by\nthe servant of Lord C--- in something I said in praise of my master, I\ndetermined to call him out; so I went into another room and wrote a\nchallenge.  But whom should I send it by?  Several servants to whom I\napplied refused to be the bearers of it; they said I had lost caste, and\nthey could not think of going out with me.  At length the servant of the\nDuke of B--- consented to take it; but he made me to understand that,\nthough he went out with me, he did so merely because he despised the\nWhiggish principles of Lord C---'s servant, and that if I thought he\nintended to associate with me I should be mistaken.  Politics, I must\ntell you, at that time ran as high amongst the servants as the gentlemen,\nthe servants, however, being almost invariably opposed to the politics of\ntheir respective masters, though both parties agreed in one point, the\nscouting of everything low and literary, though I think, of the two, the\nliberal or reform party were the most inveterate.  So he took my\nchallenge, which was accepted; we went out, Lord C---'s servant being\nseconded by a reformado footman from the palace.  We fired three times\nwithout effect; but this affair lost me my place; my master on hearing it\nforthwith discharged me; he was, as I have said before, very sensitive,\nand he said this duel of mine was a parody of his own.  Being, however,\none of the best men in the world, on his discharging me he made me a\ndonation of twenty pounds.\n\n'And it was well that he made me this present, for without it I should\nhave been penniless, having contracted rather expensive habits during the\ntime that I lived with the young baronet.  I now determined to visit my\nparents, whom I had not seen for years.  I found them in good health,\nand, after staying with them for two months, I returned again in the\ndirection of town, walking, in order to see the country.  On the second\nday of my journey, not being used to such fatigue, I fell ill at a great\ninn on the north road, and there I continued for some weeks till I\nrecovered, but by that time my money was entirely spent.  By living at\nthe inn I had contracted an acquaintance with the master and the people,\nand become accustomed to inn life.  As I thought that I might find some\ndifficulty in procuring any desirable situation in London, owing to my\nlate connection with literature, I determined to remain where I was,\nprovided my services would be accepted.  I offered them to the master,\nwho, finding I knew something of horses, engaged me as a postilion.  I\nhave remained there since.  You have now heard my story.\n\n'Stay, you shan't say that I told my tale without a per--peroration.  What\nshall it be?  Oh, I remember something which will serve for one.  As I\nwas driving my chaise some weeks ago, I saw standing at the gate of an\navenue, which led up to an old mansion, a figure which I thought I\nrecognised.  I looked at it attentively, and the figure, as I passed,\nlooked at me; whether it remembered me I do not know, but I recognised\nthe face it showed me full well.\n\n'If it was not the identical face of the red-haired priest whom I had\nseen at Rome, may I catch cold!\n\n'Young gentleman, I will now take a spell on your blanket--young lady,\ngood-night.'\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n{5}  'In Cornwall are the best gentlemen.'--_Corn.
