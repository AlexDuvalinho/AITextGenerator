STOCKTON\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n  THE MAGIC EGG\n  \"HIS WIFE'S DECEASED SISTER\"\n  THE WIDOW'S CRUISE\n  CAPTAIN ELI'S BEST EAR\n  LOVE BEFORE BREAKFAST\n  THE STAYING POWER OF SIR ROHAN\n  A PIECE OF RED CALICO\n  THE CHRISTMAS WRECK\n  MY WELL AND WHAT CAME OUT OF IT\n  MR. TOLMAN\n  MY UNWILLING NEIGHBOR\n  OUR ARCHERY CLUB\n\n\n\n\nTHE MAGIC EGG\n\nThe pretty little theatre attached to the building of the Unicorn Club\nhad been hired for a certain January afternoon by Mr. Herbert Loring,\nwho wished to give therein a somewhat novel performance, to which he\nhad invited a small audience consisting entirely of friends and\nacquaintances.\n\nLoring was a handsome fellow about thirty years old, who had travelled\nfar and studied much.  He had recently made a long sojourn in the far\nEast, and his friends had been invited to the theatre to see some of\nthe wonderful things he had brought from that country of wonders.  As\nLoring was a club-man, and belonged to a family of good social\nstanding, his circle of acquaintances was large, and in this circle a\ngood many unpleasant remarks had been made regarding the proposed\nentertainment--made, of course, by the people who had not been invited\nto be present.  Some of the gossip on the subject had reached Loring,\nwho did not hesitate to say that he could not talk to a crowd, and that\nhe did not care to show the curious things he had collected to people\nwho would not thoroughly appreciate them.  He had been very particular\nin regard to his invitations.\n\nAt three o'clock on the appointed afternoon nearly all the people who\nhad been invited to the Unicorn Theatre were in their seats.  No one\nhad stayed away except for some very good reason, for it was well known\nthat if Herbert Loring offered to show anything it was worth seeing.\n\nAbout forty people were present, who sat talking to one another, or\nadmiring the decoration of the theatre.  As Loring stood upon the\nstage--where he was entirely alone, his exhibition requiring no\nassistants--he gazed through a loophole in the curtain upon a very\ninteresting array of faces.  There were the faces of many men and women\nof society, of students, of workers in various fields of thought, and\neven of idlers in all fields of thought; but there was not one which\nindicated a frivolous or listless disposition.  The owners of those\nfaces had come to see something, and they wished to see it.\n\nFor a quarter of an hour after the time announced for the opening of\nthe exhibition Loring peered through the hole in the curtain, and then,\nalthough all the people he had expected had not arrived, he felt it\nwould not do for him to wait any longer.  The audience was composed of\nwell-bred and courteous men and women, but despite their polite\nself-restraint Loring could see that some of them were getting tired of\nwaiting.  So, very reluctantly, and feeling that further delay was\nimpossible, he raised the curtain and came forward on the stage.\n\nBriefly he announced that the exhibition would open with some fireworks\nhe had brought from Corea.  It was plain to see that the statement that\nfireworks were about to be set off on a theatre stage, by an amateur,\nhad rather startled some of the audience, and Loring hastened to\nexplain that these were not real fireworks, but that they were\ncontrivances made of colored glass, which were illuminated by the\npowerful lens of a lantern which was placed out of sight, and while the\napparent pyrotechnic display would resemble fireworks of strange and\ngrotesque designs, it would be absolutely without danger.  He brought\nout some little bunches of bits of colored glass, hung them at some\ndistance apart on a wire which was stretched across the stage just high\nenough for him to reach it, and then lighted his lantern, which he\nplaced in one of the wings, lowered all the lights in the theatre, and\nbegan his exhibition.\n\nAs Loring turned his lantern on one of the clusters of glass lenses,\nstrips, and points, and, unseen himself, caused them to move by means\nof long cords attached, the effects were beautiful and marvellous.\nLittle wheels of colored fire rapidly revolved, miniature rockets\nappeared to rise a few feet and to explode in the air, and while all\nthe ordinary forms of fireworks were produced on a diminutive scale,\nthere were some effects that were entirely novel to the audience.  As\nthe light was turned successively upon one and another of the clusters\nof glass, sometimes it would flash along the whole line so rapidly that\nall the various combinations of color and motion seemed to be combined\nin one, and then for a time each particular set of fireworks would\nblaze, sparkle, and coruscate by itself, scattering particles of\ncolored light as if they had been real sparks of fire.\n\nThis curious and beautiful exhibition of miniature pyrotechnics was\nextremely interesting to the audience, who gazed upward with rapt and\neager attention at the line of wheels, stars, and revolving spheres.\nSo far as interest gave evidence of satisfaction, there was never a\nbetter satisfied audience.  At first there had been some hushed murmurs\nof pleasure, but very soon the attention of every one seemed so\ncompletely engrossed by the dazzling display that they simply gazed in\nsilence.\n\nFor twenty minutes or longer the glittering show went on, and not a\nsign of weariness or inattention was made by any one of the assembled\ncompany.  Then gradually the colors of the little fireworks faded, the\nstars and wheels revolved more slowly, the lights in the body of the\ntheatre were gradually raised, and the stage curtain went softly down.\n\nAnxiously, and a little pale, Herbert Loring peered through the\nloophole in the curtain.  It was not easy to judge of the effects of\nhis exhibition, and he did not know whether or not it had been a\nsuccess.  There was no applause, but, on the other hand, there was no\nsigns that any one resented the exhibition as a childish display of\ncolored lights.  It was impossible to look upon that audience without\nbelieving that they had been thoroughly interested in what they had\nseen, and that they expected to see more.\n\nFor two or three minutes Loring gazed through his loophole, and then,\nstill with some doubt in his heart, but with a little more color in his\nchecks, he prepared for the second part of his performance.\n\nAt this moment there entered the theatre, at the very back of the\nhouse, a young lady.  She was handsome and well dressed, and as she\nopened the door--Loring had employed no ushers or other assistants in\nthis little social performance--she paused for a moment and looked into\nthe theatre, and then noiselessly stepped to a chair in the back row\nand sat down.\n\nThis was Edith Starr, who, a month before, had been betrothed to\nHerbert Loring.  Edith and her mother had been invited to this\nperformance, and front seats had been reserved for them, for each guest\nhad received a numbered card.  But Mrs. Starr had a headache, and could\nnot go out that afternoon, and for a time her daughter had thought that\nshe, too, must give up the pleasure Loring had promised her, and stay\nwith her mother.  But when the elder lady dropped into a quiet sleep,\nEdith thought that, late as it was, she would go by herself, and see\nwhat she could of the performance.\n\nShe was quite certain that if her presence were known to Loring he\nwould stop whatever he was doing until she had been provided with a\nseat which he thought suitable for her, for he had made a point of her\nbeing properly seated when he gave the invitations.  Therefore, being\nequally desirous of not disturbing the performance and of not being\nherself conspicuous, she sat behind two rather large men, where she\ncould see the stage perfectly well, but where she herself would not be\nlikely to be seen.\n\nIn a few moments the curtain rose, and Loring came forward, carrying a\nsmall, light table, which he placed near the front of the stage, and\nfor a moment stood quietly by it.  Edith noticed upon his face the\nexpression of uncertainty and anxiety which had not yet left it.\nStanding by the side of the table, and speaking very slowly, but so\nclearly that his words could be heard distinctly in all parts of the\nroom, he began some introductory remarks regarding the second part of\nhis performance.\n\n\"The extraordinary, and I may say marvellous, thing which I am about to\nshow you,\" he said, \"is known among East Indian magicians as the magic\negg.  The exhibition is a very uncommon one, and has seldom been seen\nby Americans or Europeans, and it was by a piece of rare good fortune\nthat I became possessed of the appliances necessary for this\nexhibition.  They are indeed very few and simple, but never before, to\nthe best of my knowledge and belief, have they been seen outside of\nIndia.\n\n\"I will now get the little box which contains the articles necessary\nfor this magical performance, and I will say that if I had time to tell\nyou of the strange and amazing adventure which resulted in my\npossession of this box, I am sure you would be as much interested in\nthat as I expect you to be in the contents of the box.  But in order\nthat none of you may think this is an ordinary trick, executed by means\nof concealed traps or doors, I wish you to take particular notice of\nthis table, which is, as you see, a plain, unpainted pine table, with\nnothing but a flat top, and four straight legs at the corners.  You can\nsee under and around it, and it gives no opportunity to conceal\nanything.\" Then, standing for a few moments as if he had something else\nto say, he turned and stepped toward one of the wings.\n\nEdith was troubled as she looked at her lover during these remarks.\nHer interest was great, greater, indeed, than that of the people about\nher, but it was not a pleasant interest.  As Loring stopped speaking,\nand looked about him, there was a momentary flush on his face.  She\nknew this was caused by excitement, and she was pale from the same\ncause.\n\nVery soon Loring came forward, and stood by the table.\n\n\"Here is the box,\" he said, \"of which I spoke, and as I hold it up I\nthink you all can see it.  It is not large, being certainly not more\nthan twelve inches in length and two deep, but it contains some very\nwonderful things.  The outside of this box is covered with delicate\nengraving and carving which you cannot see, and these marks and lines\nhave, I think, some magical meaning, but I do not know what it is.  I\nwill now open the box and show you what is inside.  The first thing I\ntake out is this little stick, not thicker than a lead-pencil, but\nsomewhat longer, as you see.  This is a magical wand, and is covered\nwith inscriptions of the same character as those on the outside of the\nbox.  The next thing is this little red bag, well filled, as you see,\nwhich I shall put on the table, for I shall not yet need it.\n\n\"Now I take out a piece of cloth which is folded into a very small\ncompass, but as I unfold it you will perceive that it is more than a\nfoot square, and is covered with embroidery.  All those strange lines\nand figures in gold and red, which you can plainly see on the cloth as\nI hold it up, are also characters in the same magic language as those\non the box and wand.  I will now spread the cloth on the table, and\nthen take out the only remaining thing in the box, and this is nothing\nin the world but an egg--a simple, ordinary hen's egg, as you all see\nas I hold it up.  It may be a trifle larger than an ordinary egg, but\nthen, after all, it is nothing but a common egg--that is, in\nappearance.  In reality it is a good deal more.\n\n\"Now I will begin the performance.\"  And as he stood by the back of the\ntable, over which he had been slightly bending, and threw his eyes over\nthe audience, his voice was stronger, and his face had lost all its\npallor.  He was evidently warming up with his subject.\n\n\"I now take up this wand,\" he said, \"which, while I hold it, gives me\npower to produce the phenomena which you are about to behold.  You may\nnot all believe that there is any magic whatever about this little\nperformance, and that it is all a bit of machinery; but whatever you\nmay think about it, you shall see what you shall see.\n\n\"Now with this wand I gently touch this egg which is lying on the\nsquare of cloth.  I do not believe you can see what has happened to\nthis egg, but I will tell you.  There is a little line, like a hair,\nentirely around it.  Now that line has become a crack.  Now you can see\nit, I know.  It grows wider and wider!  Look!  The shell of the egg is\nseparating in the middle.  The whole egg slightly moves.  Do you notice\nthat?  Now you can see something yellow showing itself between the two\nparts of the shell.  See!  It is moving a good deal, and the two halves\nof the shell are separating more and more.  And now out tumbles this\nqueer little object.  Do you see what it is?  It is a poor, weak,\nlittle chick, not able to stand, but alive--alive!  You can all\nperceive that it is alive.  Now you can see that it is standing on its\nfeet, feebly enough, but still standing.\n\n\"Behold, it takes a few steps!  You cannot doubt that it is alive, and\ncame out of that egg.  It is beginning to walk about over the cloth.\nDo you notice that it is picking the embroidery?  Now, little chick, I\nwill give you something to eat.  This little red bag contains grain, a\nmagical grain, with which I shall feed the chicken.  You must excuse my\nawkwardness in opening the bag, as I still hold the wand; but this\nlittle stick I must not drop.  See, little chick, there are some\ngrains!  They look like rice, but, in fact, I have no idea what they\nare.  But he knows, he knows!  Look at him!  See how he picks it up!\nThere!  He has swallowed one, two, three.  That will do, little chick,\nfor a first meal.\n\n\"The grain seems to have strengthened him already, for see how lively\nhe is, and how his yellow down stands out on him, so puffy and warm!\nYou are looking for some more grain, are you?  Well, you cannot have it\njust yet, and keep away from those pieces of eggshell, which, by the\nway, I will put back into the box.  Now, sir, try to avoid the edge of\nthe table, and, to quiet you, I will give you a little tap on the back\nwith my wand.  Now, then, please observe closely.  The down which just\nnow covered him has almost gone.  He is really a good deal bigger, and\never so much uglier.  See the little pin-feathers sticking out over\nhim!  Some spots here and there are almost bare, but he is ever so much\nmore active.  Ha!  Listen to that!  He is so strong that you can hear\nhis beak as he pecks at the table.  He is actually growing bigger and\nbigger before our very eyes!  See that funny little tail, how it begins\nto stick up, and quills are showing at the end of his wings.\n\n\"Another tap, and a few more grains.  Careful, sir!  Don't tear the\ncloth!  See how rapidly he grows!  He is fairly covered with feathers,\nred and black, with a tip of yellow in front.  You could hardly get\nthat fellow into an ostrich egg!  Now, then, what do you think of him?\nHe is big enough for a broiler, though I don't think any one would want\nto take him for that purpose.  Some more grain, and another tap from my\nwand.  See!  He does not mind the little stick, for he has been used to\nit from his very birth.  Now, then, he is what you would call a good\nhalf-grown chick.  Rather more than half grown, I should say.  Do you\nnotice his tail?  There is no mistaking him for a pullet.  The long\nfeathers are beginning to curl over already.  He must have a little\nmore grain.  Look out, sir, or you will be off the table!  Come back\nhere!  This table is too small for him, but if he were on the floor you\ncould not see him so well.\n\n\"Another tap.  Now see that comb on the top of his head; you scarcely\nnoticed it before, and now it is bright red.  And see his spurs\nbeginning to show--on good thick legs, too.  There is a fine young\nfellow for you!  Look how he jerks his head from side to side, like the\nyoung prince of a poultry-yard, as he well deserves to be!\"\n\nThe attentive interest which had at first characterized the audience\nnow changed to excited admiration and amazement.  Some leaned forward\nwith mouths wide open.  Others stood up so that they could see better.\nEjaculations of astonishment and wonder were heard on every side, and a\nmore thoroughly fascinated and absorbed audience was never seen.\n\n\"Now, my friends,\" Loring continued, \"I will give this handsome fowl\nanother tap.  Behold the result--a noble, full-grown cock!  Behold his\nspurs!  They are nearly an inch long!  See, there is a comb for you!\nAnd what a magnificent tail of green and black, contrasting so finely\nwith the deep red of the rest of his body!  Well, sir, you are truly\ntoo big for this table.  As I cannot give you more room, I will set you\nup higher.  Move over a little, and I will set this chair on the table.\nThere!  Upon the seat!  That's right, but don't stop.  There is the\nback, which is higher yet!  Up with you!  Ha!  There, he nearly upset\nthe chair, but I will hold it.  See!  He has turned around.  Now, then,\nlook at him.  See his wings as he flaps them!  He could fly with such\nwings.  Look at him!  See that swelling breast!  Ha, ha!  Listen!  Did\nyou ever hear a crow like that?  It fairly rings through the house.\nYes, I knew it!  There is another!\"\n\nAt this point the people in the house were in a state of wild\nexcitement.  Nearly all of them were on their feet, and they were in\nsuch a condition of frantic enthusiasm that Loring was afraid some of\nthem might make a run for the stage.\n\n\"Come, sir,\" cried Loring, now almost shouting, \"that will do.  You\nhave shown us the strength of your lungs.  Jump down on the seat of the\nchair; now on the table.  There, I will take away the chair, and you\ncan stand for a moment on the table and let our friends look at you;\nbut only for a moment.  Take that tap on your back.  Now do you see any\ndifference?  Perhaps you may not, but I do.  Yes, I believe you all do.\nHe is not the big fellow he was a minute ago.  He is really\nsmaller--only a fine cockerel.  A nice tail that, but with none of the\nnoble sweep that it had a minute ago.  No, don't try to get off the\ntable.  You can't escape my wand.  Another tap.  Behold a half-grown\nchicken, good to eat, but with not a crow in him.  Hungry, are you?\nBut you need not pick at the table that way.  You get no more grain,\nbut only this little tap.  Ha, ha!  What are you coming to?  There is a\nchicken barely feathered enough for us to tell what color he is going\nto be.\n\n\"Another tap will take still more of the conceit out of him.  Look at\nhim!  There are his pin-feathers, and his bare spots.  Don't try to get\naway; I can easily tap you again.  Now then.  Here is a lovely little\nchick, fluffy with yellow down.  He is active enough, but I shall quiet\nhim.  One tap, and now what do you see?  A poor, feeble chicken,\nscarcely able to stand, with his down all packed close to him as if he\nhad been out in the rain.  Ah, little chick, I will take the two halves\nof the egg-shell from which you came, and put them on each side of you.\nCome, now get in!  I close them up.  You are lost to view.  There is\nnothing to be seen but a crack around the shell!  Now it has gone!\nThere, my friends; as I hold it on high, behold the magic egg, exactly\nas it was when I first took it out of the box, into which I will place\nit again, with the cloth and the wand and the little red bag, and shut\nit up with a snap.  I will let you take one more look at this box\nbefore I put it away behind the scenes.  Are you satisfied with what I\nhave shown you?  Do you think it is really as wonderful as you supposed\nit would be?\"\n\nAt these words the whole audience burst into riotous applause, during\nwhich Loring disappeared, but he was back in a moment.\n\n\"Thank you!\" he cried, bowing low, and waving his arms before him in\nthe manner of an Eastern magician making a salaam.  From side to side\nhe turned, bowing and thanking, and then, with a hearty \"Good-by to\nyou; good-by to you all!\" he stepped back and let down the curtain.\n\nFor some moments the audience remained in their seats as if they were\nexpecting something more, and then they rose quietly and began to\ndisperse.  Most of them were acquainted with one another, and there was\na good deal of greeting and talking as they went out of the theatre.\n\nWhen Loring was sure the last person had departed, he turned down the\nlights, locked the door, and gave the key to the steward of the club.\n\nHe walked to his home a happy man.  His exhibition had been a perfect\nsuccess, with not a break or a flaw in it from beginning to end.\n\n\"I feel,\" thought the young man, as he strode along, \"as if I could fly\nto the top of that steeple, and flap and crow until all the world heard\nme.\"\n\nThat evening, as was his daily custom, Herbert Loring called upon Miss\nStarr.  He found the young lady in the library.\n\n\"I came in here,\" she said, \"because I have a good deal to talk to you\nabout, and I do not want interruptions.\"\n\nWith this arrangement the young man expressed his entire satisfaction,\nand immediately began to inquire the cause of her absence from his\nexhibition in the afternoon.\n\n\"But I was there,\" said Edith.  \"You did not see me, but I was there.\nMother had a headache, and I went by myself.\"\n\n\"You were there!\" exclaimed Loring, almost starting from his chair.  \"I\ndon't understand.  You were not in your seat.\"\n\n \"No,\" answered Edith.  \"I was on the very back row of seats.\nYou could not see me, and I did not wish you to see me.\"\n\n\"Edith!\" exclaimed Loring, rising to his feet and leaning over the\nlibrary table, which was between them.  \"When did you come?  How much\nof the performance did you see?\"\n\n\"I was late,\" she said.  \"I did not arrive until after the fireworks,\nor whatever they were.\"\n\nFor a moment Loring was silent, as if he did not understand the\nsituation.\n\n\"Fireworks!\" he said.  \"How did you know there had been fireworks?\"\n\n\"I heard the people talking of them as they left the theatre,\" she\nanswered.\n\n\"And what did they say?\" he inquired quickly.\n\n\"They seemed to like them very well,\" she replied, \"but I do not think\nthey were quite satisfied.  From what I heard some persons say, I\ninferred that they thought it was not very much of a show to which you\nhad invited them.\"\n\nAgain Loring stood in thought, looking down at the table.  But before\nhe could speak again, Edith sprang to her feet.\n\n\"Herbert Loring,\" she cried, \"what does all this mean?  I was there\nduring the whole of the exhibition of what you called the magic egg.  I\nsaw all those people wild with excitement at the wonderful sight of the\nchicken that came out of the egg, and grew to full size, and then\ndwindled down again, and went back into the egg, and, Herbert, there\nwas no egg, and there was no little box, and there was no wand, and no\nembroidered cloth, and there was no red bag, nor any little chick, and\nthere was no full-grown fowl, and there was no chair that you put on\nthe table!  There was nothing, absolutely nothing, but you and that\ntable!  Even the table was not what you said it was.  It was not an\nunpainted pine table with four straight legs.  It was a table of dark\npolished wood, and it stood on a single post with feet.  There was\nnothing there that you said was there.  Everything was a sham and a\ndelusion; every word you spoke was untrue.  And yet everybody in that\ntheatre, excepting you and me, saw all the things that you said were on\nthe stage.  I know they saw them all, for I was with the people, and\nheard them, and saw them, and at times I fairly felt the thrill of\nenthusiasm which possessed them as they glared at the miracles and\nwonders you said were happening.\"\n\nLoring smiled.  \"Sit down, my dear Edith,\" he said.  \"You are excited,\nand there is not the slightest cause for it.  I will explain the whole\naffair to you.  It is simple enough.  You know that study is the great\nobject of my life.  I study all sorts of things; and just now I am\ngreatly interested in hypnotism.  The subject has become fascinating to\nme.  I have made a great many successful trials of my power, and the\naffair of this afternoon was nothing but a trial of my powers on a more\nextensive scale than anything I have yet attempted.  I wanted to see if\nit were possible for me to hypnotize a considerable number of people\nwithout any one suspecting what I intended to do. The result was a\nsuccess.  I hypnotized all those people by means of the first part of\nmy performance, which consisted of some combinations of colored glass\nwith lights thrown upon them.  They revolved, and looked like\nfireworks, and were strung on a wire high up on the stage.\n\n\"I kept up the glittering and dazzling show--which was well worth\nseeing, I can assure you--until the people had been straining their\neyes upward for almost half an hour.  And this sort of thing--I will\ntell you if you do not know it--is one of the methods of producing\nhypnotic sleep.\n\n\"There was no one present who was not an impressionable subject, for I\nwas very careful in sending out my invitations, and when I became\nalmost certain that my audience was thoroughly hypnotized, I stopped\nthe show and began the real exhibition, which was not really for their\nbenefit, but for mine.\n\n\"Of course, I was dreadfully anxious for fear I had not succeeded\nentirely, and that there might be at least some one person who had not\nsuccumbed to the hypnotic influences, and so I tested the matter by\nbringing out that table and telling them it was something it was not.\nIf I had had any reason for supposing that some of the audience saw the\ntable as it really was, I had an explanation ready, and I could have\nretired from my position without any one supposing that I had intended\nmaking hypnotic experiments.  The rest of the exhibition would have\nbeen some things that any one could see, and as soon as possible I\nwould have released from their spell those who were hypnotized.  But\nwhen I became positively assured that every one saw a light pine table\nwith four straight legs, I confidently went on with the performances of\nthe magic egg.\"\n\nEdith Starr was still standing by the library table.  She had not\nheeded Loring's advice to sit down, and she was trembling with emotion.\n\n\"Herbert Loring,\" she said, \"you invited my mother and me to that\nexhibition.  You gave us tickets for front seats, where we would be\ncertain to be hypnotized if your experiment succeeded, and you would\nhave made us see that false show, which faded from those people's minds\nas soon as they recovered from the spell, for as they went away they\nwere talking only of the fireworks, and not one of them mentioned a\nmagic egg, or a chicken, or anything of the kind.  Answer me this: did\nyou not intend that I should come and be put under that spell?\"\n\nLoring smiled.  \"Yes,\" he said, \"of course I did.  But then your case\nwould have been different from that of the other spectators: I should\nhave explained the whole thing to you, and I am sure we would have had\na great deal of pleasure, and profit too, in discussing your\nexperiences.  The subject is extremely--\"\n\n\"Explain to me!\" she cried.  \"You would not have dared to do it!  I do\nnot know how brave you may be, but I know you would not have had the\ncourage to come here and tell me that you had taken away my reason and\nmy judgment, as you took them away from all those people, and that you\nhad made me a mere tool of your will--glaring and panting with\nexcitement at the wonderful things you told me to see where nothing\nexisted.  I have nothing to say about the others.  They can speak for\nthemselves if they ever come to know what you did to them.  I speak for\nmyself.  I stood up with the rest of the people.  I gazed with all my\npower, and over and over again I asked myself if it could be possible\nthat anything was the matter with my eyes or my brain, and if I could\nbe the only person there who could not see the marvellous spectacle\nthat you were describing.  But now I know that nothing was real, not\neven the little pine table--not even the man!\"\n\n\"Not even me!\" exclaimed Loring.  \"Surely I was real enough!\"\n\n\"On that stage, yes,\" she said.  \"But you there proved you were not the\nHerbert Loring to whom I promised myself.  He was an unreal being.  If\nhe had existed he would not have been a man who would have brought me\nto that public place, all ignorant of his intentions, to cloud my\nperceptions, to subject my intellect to his own, and make me believe a\nlie.  If a man should treat me in that way once he would treat me so at\nother times, and in other ways, if he had the chance.  You have treated\nme in the past as to-day you treated those people who glared at the\nmagic egg.  In the days gone by you made me see an unreal man, but you\nwill never do it again!  Good-by.\"\n\n\"Edith,\" cried Loring, \"you don't--\"\n\nBut she had disappeared through a side door, and he never spoke to her\nagain.\n\nWalking home through the dimly lighted streets, Loring involuntarily\nspoke aloud.\n\n\"And this,\" he said, \"is what came out of the magic egg!\"\n\n\n\n\n\"HIS WIFE'S DECEASED SISTER\"\n\nIt is now five years since an event occurred which so colored my life,\nor rather so changed some of its original colors, that I have thought\nit well to write an account of it, deeming that its lessons may be of\nadvantage to persons whose situations in life are similar to my own.\n\nWhen I was quite a young man I adopted literature as a profession, and\nhaving passed through the necessary preparatory grades, I found myself,\nafter a good many years of hard and often unremunerative work, in\npossession of what might be called a fair literary practice.  My\narticles, grave, gay, practical, or fanciful, had come to be considered\nwith a favor by the editors of the various periodicals for which I\nwrote, on which I found in time I could rely with a very comfortable\ncertainty.  My productions created no enthusiasm in the reading public;\nthey gave me no great reputation or very valuable pecuniary return; but\nthey were always accepted, and my receipts from them, at the time to\nwhich I have referred, were as regular and reliable as a salary, and\nquite sufficient to give me more than a comfortable support.\n\nIt was at this time I married.  I had been engaged for more than a\nyear, but had not been willing to assume the support of a wife until I\nfelt that my pecuniary position was so assured that I could do so with\nfull satisfaction to my own conscience.  There was now no doubt in\nregard to this position, either in my mind or in that of my wife.  I\nworked with great steadiness and regularity, I knew exactly where to\nplace the productions of my pen, and could calculate, with a fair\ndegree of accuracy, the sums I should receive for them.  We were by no\nmeans rich, but we had enough, and were thoroughly satisfied and\ncontent.\n\nThose of my readers who are married will have no difficulty in\nremembering the peculiar ecstasy of the first weeks of their wedded\nlife.  It is then that the flowers of this world bloom brightest; that\nits sun is the most genial; that its clouds are the scarcest; that its\nfruit is the most delicious; that the air is the most balmy; that its\ncigars are of the highest flavor; that the warmth and radiance of early\nmatrimonial felicity so rarefy the intellectual atmosphere that the\nsoul mounts higher, and enjoys a wider prospect, than ever before.\n\nThese experiences were mine.  The plain claret of my mind was changed\nto sparkling champagne, and at the very height of its effervescence I\nwrote a story.  The happy thought that then struck me for a tale was of\na very peculiar character, and it interested me so much that I went to\nwork at it with great delight and enthusiasm, and finished it in a\ncomparatively short time.  The title of the story was \"His Wife's\nDeceased Sister,\" and when I read it to Hypatia she was delighted with\nit, and at times was so affected by its pathos that her uncontrollable\nemotion caused a sympathetic dimness in my eyes which prevented my\nseeing the words I had written.  When the reading was ended and my wife\nhad dried her eyes, she turned to me and said, \"This story will make\nyour fortune.  There has been nothing so pathetic since Lamartine's\n`History of a Servant Girl.'\"\n\nAs soon as possible the next day I sent my story to the editor of the\nperiodical for which I wrote most frequently, and in which my best\nproductions generally appeared.  In a few days I had a letter from the\neditor, in which he praised my story as he had never before praised\nanything from my pen.  It had interested and charmed, he said, not only\nhimself, but all his associates in the office.  Even old Gibson, who\nnever cared to read anything until it was in proof, and who never\npraised anything which had not a joke in it, was induced by the example\nof the others to read this manuscript, and shed, as he asserted, the\nfirst tears that had come from his eyes since his final paternal\ncastigation some forty years before.  The story would appear, the\neditor assured me, as soon as he could possibly find room for it.\n\n If anything could make our skies more genial, our flowers\nbrighter, and the flavor of our fruit and cigars more delicious, it was\na letter like this.  And when, in a very short time, the story was\npublished, we found that the reading public was inclined to receive it\nwith as much sympathetic interest and favor as had been shown to it by\nthe editors.  My personal friends soon began to express enthusiastic\nopinions upon it.  It was highly praised in many of the leading\nnewspapers, and, altogether, it was a great literary success.  I am not\ninclined to be vain of my writings, and, in general, my wife tells me,\nI think too little of them.  But I did feel a good deal of pride and\nsatisfaction in the success of \"His Wife's Deceased Sister.\" If it did\nnot make my fortune, as my wife asserted it would, it certainly would\nhelp me very much in my literary career.\n\nIn less than a month from the writing of this story, something very\nunusual and unexpected happened to me.  A manuscript was returned by\nthe editor of the periodical in which \"His Wife's Deceased Sister\" had\nappeared.\n\n\n\"It is a good story,\" he wrote, \"but not equal to what you have just\ndone.  You have made a great hit, and it would not do to interfere with\nthe reputation you have gained by publishing anything inferior to `His\nWife's Deceased Sister,' which has had such a deserved success.\"\n\n\nI was so unaccustomed to having my work thrown back on my hands that I\nthink I must have turned a little pale when I read the letter.  I said\nnothing of the matter to my wife, for it would be foolish to drop such\ngrains of sand as this into the smoothly oiled machinery of our\ndomestic felicity, but I immediately sent the story to another editor.\nI am not able to express the astonishment I felt when, in the course of\na week, it was sent back to me.  The tone of the note accompanying it\nindicated a somewhat injured feeling on the part of the editor.\n\n\n\"I am reluctant,\" he said, \"to decline a manuscript from you; but you\nknow very well that if you sent me anything like `His Wife's Deceased\nSister' it would be most promptly accepted.\"\n\nI now felt obliged to speak of the affair to my wife, who was quite as\nmuch surprised, though, perhaps, not quite as much shocked, as I had\nbeen.\n\n\"Let us read the story again,\" she said, \"and see what is the matter\nwith it.\"  When we had finished its perusal, Hypatia remarked:  \"It is\nquite as good as many of the stories you have had printed, and I think\nit very interesting, although, of course, it is not equal to `His\nWife's Deceased Sister.'\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said I; \"that was an inspiration that I cannot expect\nevery day.  But there must be something wrong about this last story\nwhich we do not perceive.  Perhaps my recent success may have made me a\nlittle careless in writing it.\"\n\n\"I don't believe that,\" said Hypatia.\n\n\"At any rate,\" I continued, \"I will lay it aside, and will go to work\non a new one.\"\n\nIn due course of time I had another manuscript finished, and I sent it\nto my favorite periodical.  It was retained some weeks, and then came\nback to me.\n\n\"It will never do,\" the editor wrote, quite warmly, \"for you to go\nbackward.  The demand for the number containing `His Wife's Deceased\nSister' still continues, and we do not intend to let you disappoint\nthat great body of readers who would be so eager to see another number\ncontaining one of your stories.\"\n\n\nI sent this manuscript to four other periodicals, and from each of them\nit was returned with remarks to the effect that, although it was not a\nbad story in itself, it was not what they would expect from the author\nof \"His Wife's Deceased Sister.\"\n\nThe editor of a Western magazine wrote to me for a story to be\npublished in a special number which he would issue for the holidays.  I\nwrote him one of the character and length he desired, and sent it to\nhim.  By return mail it came back to me.\n\n\n\"I had hoped,\" the editor wrote, \"when I asked for a story from your\npen, to receive something like `His Wife's Deceased Sister,' and I must\nown that I am very much disappointed.\"\n\n\nI was so filled with anger when I read this note that I openly\nobjurgated \"His Wife's Deceased Sister.\"  \"You must excuse me,\" I said\nto my astonished wife, \"for expressing myself thus in your presence,\nbut that confounded story will be the ruin of me yet.  Until it is\nforgotten nobody will ever take anything I write.\"\n\n\"And you cannot expect it ever to be forgotten,\" said Hypatia, with\ntears in her eyes.\n\nIt is needless for me to detail my literary efforts in the course of\nthe next few months.  The ideas of the editors with whom my principal\nbusiness had been done, in regard to my literary ability, had been so\nraised by my unfortunate story of \"His Wife's Deceased Sister\" that I\nfound it was of no use to send them anything of lesser merit.  And as\nto the other journals which I tried, they evidently considered it an\ninsult for me to send them matter inferior to that by which my\nreputation had lately risen.  The fact was that my successful story had\nruined me.  My income was at an end, and want actually stared me in the\nface; and I must admit that I did not like the expression of its\ncountenance.  It was of no use for me to try to write another story\nlike \"His Wife's Deceased Sister.\"  I could not get married every time\nI began a new manuscript, and it was the exaltation of mind caused by\nmy wedded felicity which produced that story.\n\n\"It's perfectly dreadful!\" said my wife.  \"If I had had a sister, and\nshe had died, I would have thought it was my fault.\"\n\n\"It could not be your fault,\" I answered, \"and I do not think it was\nmine.  I had no intention of deceiving anybody into the belief that I\ncould do that sort of thing every time, and it ought not to be expected\nof me.  Suppose Raphael's patrons had tried to keep him screwed up to\nthe pitch of the Sistine Madonna, and had refused to buy anything which\nwas not as good as that.  In that case I think he would have occupied a\nmuch earlier and narrower grave than the one on which Mr. Morris Moore\nhangs his funeral decorations.\"\n\n\"But, my dear,\" said Hypatia, who was posted on such subjects, \"the\nSistine Madonna was one of his latest paintings.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said I.  \"But if he had married as I did, he would have\npainted it earlier.\"\n\nI was walking homeward one afternoon about this time, when I met\nBarbel, a man I had known well in my early literary career.  He was now\nabout fifty years of age, but looked older.  His hair and beard were\nquite gray, and his clothes, which were of the same general hue, gave\nme the idea that they, like his hair, had originally been black.  Age\nis very hard on a man's external appointments.  Barbel had an air of\nhaving been to let for a long time, and quite out of repair.  But there\nwas a kindly gleam in his eye, and he welcomed me cordially.\n\n\"Why, what is the matter, old fellow?\" said he.  \"I never saw you look\nso woe-begone.\"\n\nI had no reason to conceal anything from Barbel.  In my younger days he\nhad been of great use to me, and he had a right to know the state of my\naffairs.  I laid the whole case plainly before him.\n\n\"Look here,\" he said, when I had finished; \"come with me to my room; I\nhave something I would like to say to you there.\"\n\nI followed Barbel to his room.  It was at the top of a very dirty and\nwell-worn house, which stood in a narrow and lumpy street, into which\nfew vehicles ever penetrated, except the ash and garbage-carts, and the\nrickety wagons of the venders of stale vegetables.\n\n\"This is not exactly a fashionable promenade,\" said Barbel, as we\napproached the house, \"but in some respects it reminds me of the\nstreets in Italian towns, where the palaces lean over toward each other\nin such a friendly way.\"\n\nBarbel's room was, to my mind, rather more doleful than the street.  It\nwas dark, it was dusty, and cobwebs hung from every corner.  The few\nchairs upon the floor and the books upon a greasy table seemed to be\nafflicted with some dorsal epidemic, for their backs were either gone\nor broken.  A little bedstead in the corner was covered with a spread\nmade of New York \"Heralds\" with their edges pasted together.\n\n\"There is nothing better,\" said Barbel, noticing my glance toward this\nnovel counterpane, \"for a bed-covering than newspapers; they keep you\nas warm as a blanket, and are much lighter.  I used to use `Tribunes,'\nbut they rattled too much.\"\n\nThe only part of the room which was well lighted was one end near the\nsolitary window.  Here, upon a table with a spliced leg, stood a little\ngrindstone.\n\n\"At the other end of the room,\" said Barbel, \"is my cook-stove, which\nyou can't see unless I light the candle in the bottle which stands by\nit.  But if you don't care particularly to examine it, I won't go to\nthe expense of lighting up.  You might pick up a good many odd pieces\nof bric-a-brac, around here, if you chose to strike a match and\ninvestigate.  But I would not advise you to do so.  It would pay better\nto throw the things out of the window than to carry them down-stairs.\nThe particular piece of indoor decoration to which I wish to call your\nattention is this.\"  And he led me to a little wooden frame which hung\nagainst the wall near the window.  Behind a dusty piece of glass it\nheld what appeared to be a leaf from a small magazine or journal.\n\"There,\" said he, \"you see a page from the `Grasshopper,' a humorous\npaper which flourished in this city some half-dozen years ago.  I used\nto write regularly for that paper, as you may remember.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed!\" I exclaimed.  \"And I shall never forget your\n`Conundrum of the Anvil' which appeared in it.  How often have I\nlaughed at that most wonderful conceit, and how often have I put it to\nmy friends!\"\n\nBarbel gazed at me silently for a moment, and then he pointed to the\nframe.  \"That printed page,\" he said solemnly, \"contains the `Conundrum\nof the Anvil.'  I hang it there so that I can see it while I work.\nThat conundrum ruined me.  It was the last thing I wrote for the\n`Grasshopper.'  How I ever came to imagine it, I cannot tell.  It is\none of those things which occur to a man but once in a lifetime.  After\nthe wild shout of delight with which the public greeted that conundrum,\nmy subsequent efforts met with hoots of derision.  The `Grasshopper'\nturned its hind legs upon me.  I sank from bad to worse,--much\nworse,--until at last I found myself reduced to my present occupation,\nwhich is that of grinding points on pins.  By this I procure my bread,\ncoffee, and tobacco, and sometimes potatoes and meat.  One day while I\nwas hard at work, an organ-grinder came into the street below.  He\nplayed the serenade from `Trovatore' and the familiar notes brought\nback visions of old days and old delights, when the successful writer\nwore good clothes and sat at operas, when he looked into sweet eyes and\ntalked of Italian airs, when his future appeared all a succession of\nbright scenery and joyous acts, without any provision for a\ndrop-curtain.  And as my ear listened, and my mind wandered in this\nhappy retrospect, my every faculty seemed exalted, and, without any\nthought upon the matter, I ground points upon my pins so fine, so\nregular, and so smooth that they would have pierced with ease the\nleather of a boot, or slipped, without abrasion, among the finest\nthreads of rare old lace.  When the organ stopped, and I fell back into\nmy real world of cobwebs and mustiness, I gazed upon the pins I had\njust ground, and, without a moment's hesitation, I threw them into the\nstreet, and reported the lot as spoiled.  This cost me a little money,\nbut it saved me my livelihood.\"\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, Barbel resumed:\n\n\"I have no more to say to you, my young friend.  All I want you to do\nis to look upon that framed conundrum, then upon this grindstone, and\nthen to go home and reflect.  As for me, I have a gross of pins to\ngrind before the sun goes down.\"\n\nI cannot say that my depression of mind was at all relieved by what I\nhad seen and heard.  I had lost sight of Barbel for some years, and I\nhad supposed him still floating on the sun-sparkling stream of\nprosperity where I had last seen him.  It was a great shock to me to\nfind him in such a condition of poverty and squalor, and to see a man\nwho had originated the \"Conundrum of the Anvil\" reduced to the\nsoul-depressing occupation of grinding pin-points.  As I walked and\nthought, the dreadful picture of a totally eclipsed future arose before\nmy mind.  The moral of Barbel sank deep into my heart.\n\nWhen I reached home I told my wife the story of my friend Barbel.  She\nlistened with a sad and eager interest.\n\n\"I am afraid,\" she said, \"if our fortunes do not quickly mend, that we\nshall have to buy two little grindstones.  You know I could help you at\nthat sort of thing.\"\n\nFor a long time we sat together and talked, and devised many plans for\nthe future.  I did not think it necessary yet for me to look out for a\npin contract; but I must find some way of making money, or we should\nstarve to death.  Of course, the first thing that suggested itself was\nthe possibility of finding some other business.  But, apart from the\ndifficulty of immediately obtaining remunerative work in occupations to\nwhich I had not been trained, I felt a great and natural reluctance to\ngive up a profession for which I had carefully prepared myself, and\nwhich I had adopted as my life-work.  It would be very hard for me to\nlay down my pen forever, and to close the top of my inkstand upon all\nthe bright and happy fancies which I had seen mirrored in its tranquil\npool.  We talked and pondered the rest of that day and a good deal of\nthe night, but we came to no conclusion as to what it would be best for\nus to do.\n\nThe next day I determined to go and call upon the editor of the journal\nfor which, in happier days, before the blight of \"His Wife's Deceased\nSister\" rested upon me, I used most frequently to write, and, having\nfrankly explained my condition to him, to ask his advice.  The editor\nwas a good man, and had always been my friend.  He listened with great\nattention to what I told him, and evidently sympathized with me in my\ntrouble.\n\n\"As we have written to you,\" he said, \"the only reason why we did not\naccept the manuscripts you sent us was that they would have\ndisappointed the high hopes that the public had formed in regard to\nyou.  We have had letter after letter asking when we were going to\npublish another story like `His Wife's Deceased Sister.'  We felt, and\nwe still feel, that it would be wrong to allow you to destroy the fair\nfabric which you yourself have raised.  But,\" he added, with a kind\nsmile, \"I see very plainly that your well-deserved reputation will be\nof little advantage to you if you should starve at the moment that its\ngenial beams are, so to speak, lighting you up.\"\n\n\"Its beams are not genial,\" I answered.  \"They have scorched and\nwithered me.\"\n\n\"How would you like,\" said the editor, after a short reflection, \"to\nallow us to publish the stories you have recently written under some\nother name than your own?  That would satisfy us and the public, would\nput money in your pocket, and would not interfere with your reputation.\"\n\nJoyfully I seized the noble fellow by the hand, and instantly accepted\nhis proposition.  \"Of course,\" said I, \"a reputation is a very good\nthing; but no reputation can take the place of food, clothes, and a\nhouse to live in, and I gladly agree to sink my over-illumined name\ninto oblivion, and to appear before the public as a new and unknown\nwriter.\"\n\n\"I hope that need not be for long,\" he said, \"for I feel sure that you\nwill yet write stories as good as `His Wife's Deceased Sister.'\"\n\nAll the manuscripts I had on hand I now sent to my good friend the\neditor, and in due and proper order they appeared in his journal under\nthe name of John Darmstadt, which I had selected as a substitute for my\nown, permanently disabled.  I made a similar arrangement with other\neditors, and John Darmstadt received the credit of everything that\nproceeded from my pen.  Our circumstances now became very comfortable,\nand occasionally we even allowed ourselves to indulge in little dreams\nof prosperity.\n\nTime passed on very pleasantly.  One year, another, and then a little\nson was born to us.  It is often difficult, I believe, for thoughtful\npersons to decide whether the beginning of their conjugal career, or\nthe earliest weeks in the life of their first-born, be the happiest and\nproudest period of their existence.  For myself I can only say that the\nsame exaltation of mind, the same rarefication of idea and invention,\nwhich succeeded upon my wedding day came upon me now.  As then, my\necstatic emotions crystallized themselves into a motive for a story,\nand without delay I set myself to work upon it.  My boy was about six\nweeks old when the manuscript was finished, and one evening, as we sat\nbefore a comfortable fire in our sitting-room, with the curtains drawn,\nand the soft lamp lighted, and the baby sleeping soundly in the\nadjoining chamber, I read the story to my wife.\n\nWhen I had finished, my wife arose and threw herself into my arms.  \"I\nwas never so proud of you,\" she said, her glad eyes sparkling, \"as I am\nat this moment.  That is a wonderful story!  It is, indeed I am sure it\nis, just as good as `His Wife's Deceased Sister.'\"\n\nAs she spoke these words, a sudden and chilling sensation crept over us\nboth.  All her warmth and fervor, and the proud and happy glow\nengendered within me by this praise and appreciation from one I loved,\nvanished in an instant.  We stepped apart, and gazed upon each other\nwith pallid faces.  In the same moment the terrible truth had flashed\nupon us both.  This story WAS as good as \"His Wife's Deceased Sister\"!\n\nWe stood silent.  The exceptional lot of Barbel's super-pointed pins\nseemed to pierce our very souls.  A dreadful vision rose before me of\nan impending fall and crash, in which our domestic happiness should\nvanish, and our prospects for our boy be wrecked, just as we had began\nto build them up.\n\nMy wife approached me, and took my hand in hers, which was as cold as\nice.  \"Be strong and firm,\" she said.  \"A great danger threatens us,\nbut you must brace yourself against it.  Be strong and firm.\"\n\nI pressed her hand, and we said no more that night.\n\nThe next day I took the manuscript I had just written, and carefully\ninfolded it in stout wrapping-paper.  Then I went to a neighboring\ngrocery store and bought a small, strong, tin box, originally intended\nfor biscuit, with a cover that fitted tightly.  In this I placed my\nmanuscript, and then I took the box to a tinsmith and had the top\nfastened on with hard solder.  When I went home I ascended into the\ngarret and brought down to my study a ship's cash-box, which had once\nbelonged to one of my family who was a sea-captain.  This box was very\nheavy, and firmly bound with iron, and was secured by two massive\nlocks.  Calling my wife, I told her of the contents of the tin case,\nwhich I then placed in the box, and having shut down the heavy lid, I\ndoubly locked it.\n\n\"This key,\" said I, putting it in my pocket, \"I shall throw into the\nriver when I go out this afternoon.\"\n\nMy wife watched me eagerly, with a pallid and firm-set countenance, but\nupon which I could see the faint glimmer of returning happiness.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be well,\" she said, \"to secure it still further by\nsealing-wax and pieces of tape?\"\n\n\"No,\" said I.  \"I do not believe that any one will attempt to tamper\nwith our prosperity.  And now, my dear,\" I continued in an impressive\nvoice, \"no one but you, and, in the course of time, our son, shall know\nthat this manuscript exists.  When I am dead, those who survive me may,\nif they see fit, cause this box to be split open and the story\npublished.  The reputation it may give my name cannot harm me then.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE WIDOW'S CRUISE\n\nThe Widow Ducket lived in a small village about ten miles from the New\nJersey sea-coast.  In this village she was born, here she had married\nand buried her husband, and here she expected somebody to bury her; but\nshe was in no hurry for this, for she had scarcely reached middle age.\nShe was a tall woman with no apparent fat in her composition, and full\nof activity, both muscular and mental.\n\nShe rose at six o'clock in the morning, cooked breakfast, set the\ntable, washed the dishes when the meal was over, milked, churned,\nswept, washed, ironed, worked in her little garden, attended to the\nflowers in the front yard, and in the afternoon knitted and quilted and\nsewed, and after tea she either went to see her neighbors or had them\ncome to see her.  When it was really dark she lighted the lamp in her\nparlor and read for an hour, and if it happened to be one of Miss Mary\nWilkins's books that she read she expressed doubts as to the realism of\nthe characters therein described.\n\nThese doubts she expressed to Dorcas Networthy, who was a small, plump\nwoman, with a solemn face, who had lived with the widow for many years\nand who had become her devoted disciple.  Whatever the widow did, that\nalso did Dorcas--not so well, for her heart told her she could never\nexpect to do that, but with a yearning anxiety to do everything as well\nas she could.  She rose at five minutes past six, and in a subsidiary\nway she helped to get the breakfast, to eat it, to wash up the dishes,\nto work in the garden, to quilt, to sew, to visit and receive, and no\none could have tried harder than she did to keep awake when the widow\nread aloud in the evening.\n\nAll these things happened every day in the summertime, but in the\nwinter the widow and Dorcas cleared the snow from their little front\npath instead of attending to the flowers, and in the evening they\nlighted a fire as well as a lamp in the parlor.\n\nSometimes, however, something different happened, but this was not\noften, only a few times in the year.  One of the different things\noccurred when Mrs. Ducket and Dorcas were sitting on their little front\nporch one summer afternoon, one on the little bench on one side of the\ndoor, and the other on the little bench on the other side of the door,\neach waiting until she should hear the clock strike five, to prepare\ntea.  But it was not yet a quarter to five when a one-horse wagon\ncontaining four men came slowly down the street.  Dorcas first saw the\nwagon, and she instantly stopped knitting.\n\n\"Mercy on me!\" she exclaimed.  \"Whoever those people are, they are\nstrangers here, and they don't know where to stop, for they first go to\none side of the street and then to the other.\"\n\nThe widow looked around sharply.  \"Humph!\" said she.  \"Those men are\nsailormen.  You might see that in a twinklin' of an eye.  Sailormen\nalways drive that way, because that is the way they sail ships.  They\nfirst tack in one direction and then in another.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ducket didn't like the sea?\" remarked Dorcas, for about the three\nhundredth time.\n\n\"No, he didn't,\" answered the widow, for about the two hundred and\nfiftieth time, for there had been occasions when she thought Dorcas put\nthis question inopportunely.  \"He hated it, and he was drowned in it\nthrough trustin' a sailorman, which I never did nor shall.  Do you\nreally believe those men are comin' here?\"\n\n\"Upon my word I do!\" said Dorcas, and her opinion was correct.\n\nThe wagon drew up in front of Mrs. Ducket's little white house, and the\ntwo women sat rigidly, their hands in their laps, staring at the man\nwho drove.\n\nThis was an elderly personage with whitish hair, and under his chin a\nthin whitish beard, which waved in the gentle breeze and gave Dorcas\nthe idea that his head was filled with hair which was leaking out from\nbelow.\n\n\"Is this the Widow Ducket's?\" inquired this elderly man, in a strong,\npenetrating voice.\n\n\"That's my name,\" said the widow, and laying her knitting on the bench\nbeside her, she went to the gate.  Dorcas also laid her knitting on the\nbench beside her and went to the gate.\n\n\"I was told,\" said the elderly man, \"at a house we touched at about a\nquarter of a mile back, that the Widow Ducket's was the only house in\nthis village where there was any chance of me and my mates getting a\nmeal.  We are four sailors, and we are making from the bay over to\nCuppertown, and that's eight miles ahead yet, and we are all pretty\nsharp set for something to eat.\"\n\n\"This is the place,\" said the widow, \"and I do give meals if there is\nenough in the house and everything comes handy.\"\n\n\"Does everything come handy to-day?\" said he.\n\n\"It does,\" said she, \"and you can hitch your horse and come in; but I\nhaven't got anything for him.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" said the man, \"we brought along stores for him,\nso we'll just make fast and then come in.\"\n\nThe two women hurried into the house in a state of bustling\npreparation, for the furnishing of this meal meant one dollar in cash.\n\nThe four mariners, all elderly men, descended from the wagon, each one\nscrambling with alacrity over a different wheel.\n\nA box of broken ship-biscuit was brought out and put on the ground in\nfront of the horse, who immediately set himself to eating with great\nsatisfaction.\n\nTea was a little late that day, because there were six persons to\nprovide for instead of two, but it was a good meal, and after the four\nseamen had washed their hands and faces at the pump in the back yard\nand had wiped them on two towels furnished by Dorcas, they all came in\nand sat down.  Mrs. Ducket seated herself at the head of the table with\nthe dignity proper to the mistress of the house, and Dorcas seated\nherself at the other end with the dignity proper to the disciple of the\nmistress.  No service was necessary, for everything that was to be\neaten or drunk was on the table.\n\nWhen each of the elderly mariners had had as much bread and butter,\nquickly baked soda-biscuit, dried beef, cold ham, cold tongue, and\npreserved fruit of every variety known, as his storage capacity would\npermit, the mariner in command, Captain Bird, pushed back his chair,\nwhereupon the other mariners pushed back their chairs.\n\n\"Madam,\" said Captain Bird, \"we have all made a good meal, which didn't\nneed to be no better nor more of it, and we're satisfied; but that\nhorse out there has not had time to rest himself enough to go the eight\nmiles that lies ahead of us, so, if it's all the same to you and this\ngood lady, we'd like to sit on that front porch awhile and smoke our\npipes.  I was a-looking at that porch when I came in, and I bethought\nto myself what a rare good place it was to smoke a pipe in.\"\n\n\"There's pipes been smoked there,\" said the widow, rising, \"and it can\nbe done again.  Inside the house I don't allow tobacco, but on the\nporch neither of us minds.\"\n\n So the four captains betook themselves to the porch, two of\nthem seating themselves on the little bench on one side of the door,\nand two of them on the little bench on the other side of the door, and\nlighted their pipes.\n\n\"Shall we clear off the table and wash up the dishes,\" said Dorcas, \"or\nwait until they are gone?\"\n\n\"We will wait until they are gone,\" said the widow, \"for now that they\nare here we might as well have a bit of a chat with them.  When a\nsailorman lights his pipe he is generally willin' to talk, but when he\nis eatin' you can't get a word out of him.\"\n\nWithout thinking it necessary to ask permission, for the house belonged\nto her, the Widow Ducket brought a chair and put it in the hall close\nto the open front door, and Dorcas brought another chair and seated\nherself by the side of the widow.\n\n\"Do all you sailormen belong down there at the bay?\" asked Mrs. Ducket;\nthus the conversation began, and in a few minutes it had reached a\npoint at which Captain Bird thought it proper to say that a great many\nstrange things happen to seamen sailing on the sea which lands-people\nnever dream of.\n\n\"Such as anything in particular?\" asked the widow, at which remark\nDorcas clasped her hands in expectancy.\n\nAt this question each of the mariners took his pipe from his mouth and\ngazed upon the floor in thought.\n\n\"There's a good many strange things happened to me and my mates at sea.\nWould you and that other lady like to hear any of them?\" asked Captain\nBird.\n\n\"We would like to hear them if they are true,\" said the widow.\n\n\"There's nothing happened to me and my mates that isn't true,\" said\nCaptain Bird, \"and here is something that once happened to me:  I was\non a whaling v'yage when a big sperm-whale, just as mad as a fiery\nbull, came at us, head on, and struck the ship at the stern with such\ntremendous force that his head crashed right through her timbers and he\nwent nearly half his length into her hull.  The hold was mostly filled\nwith empty barrels, for we was just beginning our v'yage, and when he\nhad made kindling-wood of these there was room enough for him.  We all\nexpected that it wouldn't take five minutes for the vessel to fill and\ngo to the bottom, and we made ready to take to the boats; but it turned\nout we didn't need to take to no boats, for as fast as the water rushed\ninto the hold of the ship, that whale drank it and squirted it up\nthrough the two blow-holes in the top of his head, and as there was an\nopen hatchway just over his head, the water all went into the sea\nagain, and that whale kept working day and night pumping the water out\nuntil we beached the vessel on the island of Trinidad--the whale\nhelping us wonderful on our way over by the powerful working of his\ntail, which, being outside in the water, acted like a propeller.  I\ndon't believe any thing stranger than that ever happened to a whaling\nship.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the widow, \"I don't believe anything ever did.\"\n\nCaptain Bird now looked at Captain Sanderson, and the latter took his\npipe out of his mouth and said that in all his sailing around the world\nhe had never known anything queerer than what happened to a big\nsteamship he chanced to be on, which ran into an island in a fog.\nEverybody on board thought the ship was wrecked, but it had twin\nscrews, and was going at such a tremendous speed that it turned the\nisland entirely upside down and sailed over it, and he had heard tell\nthat even now people sailing over the spot could look down into the\nwater and see the roots of the trees and the cellars of the houses.\n\nCaptain Sanderson now put his pipe back into his mouth, and Captain\nBurress took out his pipe.\n\n\"I was once in an obelisk-ship,\" said he, \"that used to trade regular\nbetween Egypt and New York, carrying obelisks.  We had a big obelisk on\nboard.  The way they ship obelisks is to make a hole in the stern of\nthe ship, and run the obelisk in, p'inted end foremost; and this\nobelisk filled up nearly the whole of that ship from stern to bow.  We\nwas about ten days out, and sailing afore a northeast gale with the\nengines at full speed, when suddenly we spied breakers ahead, and our\nCaptain saw we was about to run on a bank.  Now if we hadn't had an\nobelisk on board we might have sailed over that bank, but the captain\nknew that with an obelisk on board we drew too much water for this, and\nthat we'd be wrecked in about fifty-five seconds if something wasn't\ndone quick.  So he had to do something quick, and this is what he did:\nHe ordered all steam on, and drove slam-bang on that bank.  Just as he\nexpected, we stopped so suddint that that big obelisk bounced for'ard,\nits p'inted end foremost, and went clean through the bow and shot out\ninto the sea.  The minute it did that the vessel was so lightened that\nit rose in the water and we easily steamed over the bank.  There was\none man knocked overboard by the shock when we struck, but as soon as\nwe missed him we went back after him and we got him all right.  You\nsee, when that obelisk went overboard, its butt-end, which was\nheaviest, went down first, and when it touched the bottom it just stood\nthere, and as it was such a big obelisk there was about five and a half\nfeet of it stuck out of the water.  The man who was knocked overboard\nhe just swum for that obelisk and he climbed up the hiryglyphics.  It\nwas a mighty fine obelisk, and the Egyptians had cut their hiryglyphics\ngood and deep, so that the man could get hand and foot-hold; and when\nwe got to him and took him off, he was sitting high and dry on the\np'inted end of that obelisk.  It was a great pity about the obelisk,\nfor it was a good obelisk, but as I never heard the company tried to\nraise it, I expect it is standing there yet.\"\n\nCaptain Burress now put his pipe back into his mouth and looked at\nCaptain Jenkinson, who removed his pipe and said:\n\n\"The queerest thing that ever happened to me was about a shark.  We was\noff the Banks, and the time of year was July, and the ice was coming\ndown, and we got in among a lot of it.  Not far away, off our weather\nbow, there was a little iceberg which had such a queerness about it\nthat the captain and three men went in a boat to look at it.  The ice\nwas mighty clear ice, and you could see almost through it, and right\ninside of it, not more than three feet above the waterline, and about\ntwo feet, or maybe twenty inches, inside the ice, was a whopping big\nshark, about fourteen feet long,--a regular man-eater,--frozen in there\nhard and fast.  `Bless my soul,' said the captain, `this is a wonderful\ncuriosity, and I'm going to git him out.'  Just then one of the men\nsaid he saw that shark wink, but the captain wouldn't believe him, for\nhe said that shark was frozen stiff and hard and couldn't wink.  You\nsee, the captain had his own idees about things, and he knew that\nwhales was warm-blooded and would freeze if they was shut up in ice,\nbut he forgot that sharks was not whales and that they're cold-blooded\njust like toads.  And there is toads that has been shut up in rocks for\nthousands of years, and they stayed alive, no matter how cold the place\nwas, because they was cold-blooded, and when the rocks was split, out\nhopped the frog.  But, as I said before, the captain forgot sharks was\ncold-blooded, and he determined to git that one out.\n\n\"Now you both know, being housekeepers, that if you take a needle and\ndrive it into a hunk of ice you can split it.  The captain had a\nsail-needle with him, and so he drove it into the iceberg right\nalongside of the shark and split it.  Now the minute he did it he knew\nthat the man was right when he said he saw the shark wink, for it\nflopped out of that iceberg quicker nor a flash of lightning.\"\n\n\"What a happy fish he must have been!\" ejaculated Dorcas, forgetful of\nprecedent, so great was her emotion.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Captain Jenkinson, \"it was a happy fish enough, but it\nwasn't a happy captain.  You see, that shark hadn't had anything to\neat, perhaps for a thousand years, until the captain came along with\nhis sail-needle.\"\n\n\"Surely you sailormen do see strange things,\" now said the widow, \"and\nthe strangest thing about them is that they are true.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Dorcas, \"that is the most wonderful thing.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't suppose,\" said the Widow Ducket, glancing from one bench\nof mariners to the other, \"that I have a sea-story to tell, but I have,\nand if you like I will tell it to you.\"\n\nCaptain Bird looked up a little surprised.\n\n\"We would like to hear it--indeed, we would, madam,\" said he.\n\n\"Ay, ay!\" said Captain Burress, and the two other mariners nodded.\n\n\"It was a good while ago,\" she said, \"when I was living on the shore\nnear the head of the bay, that my husband was away and I was left alone\nin the house.  One mornin' my sister-in-law, who lived on the other\nside of the bay, sent me word by a boy on a horse that she hadn't any\noil in the house to fill the lamp that she always put in the window to\nlight her husband home, who was a fisherman, and if I would send her\nsome by the boy she would pay me back as soon as they bought oil.  The\nboy said he would stop on his way home and take the oil to her, but he\nnever did stop, or perhaps he never went back, and about five o'clock I\nbegan to get dreadfully worried, for I knew if that lamp wasn't in my\nsister-in-law's window by dark she might be a widow before midnight.\nSo I said to myself, `I've got to get that oil to her, no matter what\nhappens or how it's done.'  Of course I couldn't tell what might\nhappen, but there was only one way it could be done, and that was for\nme to get into the boat that was tied to the post down by the water,\nand take it to her, for it was too far for me to walk around by the\nhead of the bay.  Now, the trouble was, I didn't know no more about a\nboat and the managin' of it than any one of you sailormen knows about\nclear starchin'.  But there wasn't no use of thinkin' what I knew and\nwhat I didn't know, for I had to take it to her, and there was no way\nof doin' it except in that boat.  So I filled a gallon can, for I\nthought I might as well take enough while I was about it, and I went\ndown to the water and I unhitched that boat and I put the oil-can into\nher, and then I got in, and off I started, and when I was about a\nquarter of a mile from the shore--\"\n\n\"Madam,\" interrupted Captain Bird, \"did you row or--or was there a sail\nto the boat?\"\n\nThe widow looked at the questioner for a moment.  \"No,\" said she, \"I\ndidn't row.  I forgot to bring the oars from the house; but it didn't\nmatter, for I didn't know how to use them, and if there had been a sail\nI couldn't have put it up, for I didn't know how to use it, either.  I\nused the rudder to make the boat go.  The rudder was the only thing I\nknew anything about.  I'd held a rudder when I was a little girl, and I\nknew how to work it.  So I just took hold of the handle of the rudder\nand turned it round and round, and that made the boat go ahead, you\nknow, and--\"\n\n\"Madam!\" exclaimed Captain Bird, and the other elderly mariners took\ntheir pipes from their mouths.\n\n\"Yes, that is the way I did it,\" continued the widow, briskly.  \"Big\nsteamships are made to go by a propeller turning round and round at\ntheir back ends, and I made the rudder work in the same way, and I got\nalong very well, too, until suddenly, when I was about a quarter of a\nmile from the shore, a most terrible and awful storm arose.  There must\nhave been a typhoon or a cyclone out at sea, for the waves came up the\nbay bigger than houses, and when they got to the head of the bay they\nturned around and tried to get out to sea again.  So in this way they\ncontinually met, and made the most awful and roarin' pilin' up of waves\nthat ever was known.\n\n\"My little boat was pitched about as if it had been a feather in a\nbreeze, and when the front part of it was cleavin' itself down into the\nwater the hind part was stickin' up until the rudder whizzed around\nlike a patent churn with no milk in it.  The thunder began to roar and\nthe lightnin' flashed, and three seagulls, so nearly frightened to\ndeath that they began to turn up the whites of their eyes, flew down\nand sat on one of the seats of the boat, forgettin' in that awful\nmoment that man was their nat'ral enemy.  I had a couple of biscuits in\nmy pocket, because I had thought I might want a bite in crossing, and I\ncrumbled up one of these and fed the poor creatures.  Then I began to\nwonder what I was goin' to do, for things were gettin' awfuller and\nawfuller every instant, and the little boat was a-heavin' and\na-pitchin' and a-rollin' and h'istin' itself up, first on one end and\nthen on the other, to such an extent that if I hadn't kept tight hold\nof the rudder-handle I'd slipped off the seat I was sittin' on.\n\n\"All of a sudden I remembered that oil in the can; but just as I was\nputtin' my fingers on the cork my conscience smote me.  `Am I goin' to\nuse this oil,' I said to myself, `and let my sister-in-law's husband be\nwrecked for want of it?'  And then I thought that he wouldn't want it\nall that night, and perhaps they would buy oil the next day, and so I\npoured out about a tumblerful of it on the water, and I can just tell\nyou sailormen that you never saw anything act as prompt as that did.\nIn three seconds, or perhaps five, the water all around me, for the\ndistance of a small front yard, was just as flat as a table and as\nsmooth as glass, and so invitin' in appearance that the three gulls\njumped out of the boat and began to swim about on it, primin' their\nfeathers and lookin' at themselves in the transparent depths, though I\nmust say that one of them made an awful face as he dipped his bill into\nthe water and tasted kerosene.\n\n\"Now I had time to sit quiet in the midst of the placid space I had\nmade for myself, and rest from workin' of the rudder.  Truly it was a\nwonderful and marvellous thing to look at.  The waves was roarin' and\nleapin' up all around me higher than the roof of this house, and\nsometimes their tops would reach over so that they nearly met and shut\nout all view of the stormy sky, which seemed as if it was bein' torn to\npieces by blazin' lightnin', while the thunder pealed so tremendous\nthat it almost drowned the roar of the waves.  Not only above and all\naround me was every thing terrific and fearful, but even under me it\nwas the same, for there was a big crack in the bottom of the boat as\nwide as my hand, and through this I could see down into the water\nbeneath, and there was--\"\n\n\"Madam!\" ejaculated Captain Bird, the hand which had been holding his\npipe a few inches from his mouth now dropping to his knee; and at this\nmotion the hands which held the pipes of the three other mariners\ndropped to their knees.\n\n\"Of course it sounds strange,\" continued the widow, \"but I know that\npeople can see down into clear water, and the water under me was clear,\nand the crack was wide enough for me to see through, and down under me\nwas sharks and swordfishes and other horrible water creatures, which I\nhad never seen before, all driven into the bay, I haven't a doubt, by\nthe violence of the storm out at sea.  The thought of my bein' upset\nand fallin' in among those monsters made my very blood run cold, and\ninvoluntary-like I began to turn the handle of the rudder, and in a\nmoment I shot into a wall of ragin' sea-water that was towerin' around\nme.  For a second I was fairly blinded and stunned, but I had the cork\nout of that oil-can in no time, and very soon--you'd scarcely believe\nit if I told you how soon--I had another placid mill-pond surroundin'\nof me.  I sat there a-pantin' and fannin' with my straw hat, for you'd\nbetter believe I was flustered, and then I began to think how long it\nwould take me to make a line of mill-ponds clean across the head of the\nbay, and how much oil it would need, and whether I had enough.  So I\nsat and calculated that if a tumblerful of oil would make a smooth\nplace about seven yards across, which I should say was the width of the\none I was in,--which I calculated by a measure of my eye as to how many\nbreadths of carpet it would take to cover it,--and if the bay was two\nmiles across betwixt our house and my sister-in-law's, and, although I\ncouldn't get the thing down to exact figures, I saw pretty soon that I\nwouldn't have oil enough to make a level cuttin' through all those\nmountainous billows, and besides, even if I had enough to take me\nacross, what would be the good of goin' if there wasn't any oil left to\nfill my sister-in-law's lamp?\n\n\"While I was thinkin' and calculatin' a perfectly dreadful thing\nhappened, which made me think if I didn't get out of this pretty soon\nI'd find myself in a mighty risky predicament.  The oil-can, which I\nhad forgotten to put the cork in, toppled over, and before I could grab\nit every drop of the oil ran into the hind part of the boat, where it\nwas soaked up by a lot of dry dust that was there.  No wonder my heart\nsank when I saw this.  Glancin' wildly around me, as people will do\nwhen they are scared, I saw the smooth place I was in gettin' smaller\nand smaller, for the kerosene was evaporatin', as it will do even off\nwoollen clothes if you give it time enough.  The first pond I had come\nout of seemed to be covered up, and the great, towerin', throbbin'\nprecipice of sea-water was a-closin' around me.\n\n\"Castin' down my eyes in despair, I happened to look through the crack\nin the bottom of the boat, and oh, what a blessed relief it was! for\ndown there everything was smooth and still, and I could see the sand on\nthe bottom, as level and hard, no doubt, as it was on the beach.\nSuddenly the thought struck me that that bottom would give me the only\nchance I had of gettin' out of the frightful fix I was in.  If I could\nfill that oil-can with air, and then puttin' it under my arm and takin'\na long breath if I could drop down on that smooth bottom, I might run\nalong toward shore, as far as I could, and then, when I felt my breath\nwas givin' out, I could take a pull at the oil-can and take another\nrun, and then take another pull and another run, and perhaps the can\nwould hold air enough for me until I got near enough to shore to wade\nto dry land.  To be sure, the sharks and other monsters were down\nthere, but then they must have been awfully frightened, and perhaps\nthey might not remember that man was their nat'ral enemy.  Anyway, I\nthought it would be better to try the smooth water passage down there\nthan stay and be swallowed up by the ragin' waves on top.\n\n\"So I blew the can full of air and corked it, and then I tore up some\nof the boards from the bottom of the boat so as to make a hole big\nenough for me to get through,--and you sailormen needn't wriggle so\nwhen I say that, for you all know a divin'-bell hasn't any bottom at\nall and the water never comes in,--and so when I got the hole big\nenough I took the oil-can under my arm, and was just about to slip down\nthrough it when I saw an awful turtle a-walkin' through the sand at the\nbottom.  Now, I might trust sharks and swordfishes and sea-serpents to\nbe frightened and forget about their nat'ral enemies, but I never could\ntrust a gray turtle as big as a cart, with a black neck a yard long,\nwith yellow bags to its jaws, to forget anything or to remember\nanything.  I'd as lieve get into a bath-tub with a live crab as to go\ndown there.  It wasn't of no use even so much as thinkin' of it, so I\ngave up that plan and didn't once look through that hole again.\"\n\n\"And what did you do, madam?\" asked Captain Bird, who was regarding her\nwith a face of stone.\n\n\"I used electricity,\" she said.  \"Now don't start as if you had a shock\nof it.  That's what I used.  When I was younger than I was then, and\nsometimes visited friends in the city, we often amused ourselves by\nrubbing our feet on the carpet until we got ourselves so full of\nelectricity that we could put up our fingers and light the gas.  So I\nsaid to myself that if I could get full of electricity for the purpose\nof lightin' the gas I could get full of it for other purposes, and so,\nwithout losin' a moment, I set to work.  I stood up on one of the\nseats, which was dry, and I rubbed the bottoms of my shoes backward and\nforward on it with such violence and swiftness that they pretty soon\ngot warm and I began fillin' with electricity, and when I was fully\ncharged with it from my toes to the top of my head, I just sprang into\nthe water and swam ashore.  Of course I couldn't sink, bein' full of\nelectricity.\"\n\nCaptain Bird heaved a long sigh and rose to his feet, whereupon the\nother mariners rose to their feet \"Madam,\" said Captain Bird, \"what's\nto pay for the supper and--the rest of the entertainment?\"\n\n\"The supper is twenty-five cents apiece,\" said the Widow Ducket, \"and\neverything else is free, gratis.\"\n\nWhereupon each mariner put his hand into his trousers pocket, pulled\nout a silver quarter, and handed it to the widow.  Then, with four\nsolemn \"Good evenin's,\" they went out to the front gate.\n\n\"Cast off, Captain Jenkinson,\" said Captain Bird, \"and you, Captain\nBurress, clew him up for'ard.  You can stay in the bow, Captain\nSanderson, and take the sheet-lines.  I'll go aft.\"\n\nAll being ready, each of the elderly mariners clambered over a wheel,\nand having seated themselves, they prepared to lay their course for\nCuppertown.\n\nBut just as they were about to start, Captain Jenkinson asked that they\nlay to a bit, and clambering down over his wheel, he reentered the\nfront gate and went up to the door of the house, where the widow and\nDorcas were still standing.\n\n\"Madam,\" said he, \"I just came back to ask what became of your\nbrother-in-law through his wife's not bein' able to put no light in the\nwindow?\"\n\n\"The storm drove him ashore on our side of the bay,\" said she, \"and the\nnext mornin' he came up to our house, and I told him all that had\nhappened to me.  And when he took our boat and went home and told that\nstory to his wife, she just packed up and went out West, and got\ndivorced from him.  And it served him right, too.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Captain Jenkinson, and going out of the gate,\nhe clambered up over the wheel, and the wagon cleared for Cuppertown.\n\nWhen the elderly mariners were gone, the Widow Ducket, still standing\nin the door, turned to Dorcas.\n\n\"Think of it!\" she said.  \"To tell all that to me, in my own house!\nAnd after I had opened my one jar of brandied peaches, that I'd been\nkeepin' for special company!\"\n\n\"In your own house!\" ejaculated Dorcas.  \"And not one of them brandied\npeaches left!\"\n\nThe widow jingled the four quarters in her hand before she slipped them\ninto her pocket.\n\n\"Anyway, Dorcas,\" she remarked, \"I think we can now say we are square\nwith all the world, and so let's go in and wash the dishes.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Dorcas, \"we're square.\"\n\n\n\n\nCAPTAIN ELI'S BEST EAR\n\nThe little seaside village of Sponkannis lies so quietly upon a\nprotected spot on our Atlantic coast that it makes no more stir in the\nworld than would a pebble which, held between one's finger and thumb,\nshould be dipped below the surface of a millpond and then dropped.\nAbout the post-office and the store--both under the same roof--the\ngreater number of the houses cluster, as if they had come for their\nweek's groceries, or were waiting for the mail, while toward the west\nthe dwellings become fewer and fewer, until at last the village blends\ninto a long stretch of sandy coast and scrubby pine-woods.  Eastward\nthe village ends abruptly at the foot of a windswept bluff, on which no\none cares to build.\n\nAmong the last houses in the western end of the village stood two neat,\nsubstantial dwellings, one belonging to Captain Eli Bunker, and the\nother to Captain Cephas Dyer.  These householders were two very\nrespectable retired mariners, the first a widower about fifty, and the\nother a bachelor of perhaps the same age, a few years more or less\nmaking but little difference in this region of weather-beaten youth and\nseasoned age.\n\nEach of these good captains lived alone, and each took entire charge of\nhis own domestic affairs, not because he was poor, but because it\npleased him to do so.  When Captain Eli retired from the sea he was the\nowner of a good vessel, which he sold at a fair profit; and Captain\nCephas had made money in many a voyage before he built his house in\nSponkannis and settled there.\n\nWhen Captain Eli's wife was living she was his household manager.  But\nCaptain Cephas had never had a woman in his house, except during the\nfirst few months of his occupancy, when certain female neighbors came\nin occasionally to attend to little matters of cleaning which,\naccording to popular notions, properly belong to the sphere of woman.\n\nBut Captain Cephas soon put an end to this sort of thing.  He did not\nlike a woman's ways, especially her ways of attending to domestic\naffairs.  He liked to live in sailor fashion, and to keep house in\nsailor fashion.  In his establishment everything was shipshape, and\neverything which could be stowed away was stowed away, and, if\npossible, in a bunker.  The floors were holystoned nearly every day,\nand the whole house was repainted about twice a year, a little at a\ntime, when the weather was suitable for this marine recreation.  Things\nnot in frequent use were lashed securely to the walls, or perhaps put\nout of the way by being hauled up to the ceiling by means of blocks and\ntackle.  His cooking was done sailor fashion, like everything else, and\nhe never failed to have plum-duff on Sunday.  His well was near his\nhouse, and every morning he dropped into it a lead and line, and noted\ndown the depth of water.  Three times a day he entered in a little\nnote-book the state of the weather, the height of the mercury in\nbarometer and thermometer, the direction of the wind, and special\nweather points when necessary.\n\nCaptain Eli managed his domestic affairs in an entirely different way.\nHe kept house woman fashion--not, however, in the manner of an ordinary\nwoman, but after the manner of his late wife, Miranda Bunker, now dead\nsome seven years.  Like his friend, Captain Cephas, he had had the\nassistance of his female neighbors during the earlier days of his\nwidowerhood.  But he soon found that these women did not do things as\nMiranda used to do them, and, although he frequently suggested that\nthey should endeavor to imitate the methods of his late consort, they\ndid not even try to do things as she used to do them, preferring their\nown ways.  Therefore it was that Captain Eli determined to keep house\nby himself, and to do it, as nearly as his nature would allow, as\nMiranda used to do it.  He swept his doors and he shook his door-mats;\nhe washed his paint with soap and hot water; he dusted his furniture\nwith a soft cloth, which he afterwards stuck behind a chest of drawers.\nHe made his bed very neatly, turning down the sheet at the top, and\nsetting the pillow upon edge, smoothing it carefully after he had done\nso.  His cooking was based on the methods of the late Miranda.  He had\nnever been able to make bread rise properly, but he had always liked\nship-biscuit, and he now greatly preferred them to the risen bread made\nby his neighbors.  And as to coffee and the plainer articles of food\nwith which he furnished his table, even Miranda herself would not have\nobjected to them had she been alive and very hungry.\n\nThe houses of the two captains were not very far apart, and they were\ngood neighbors, often smoking their pipes together and talking of the\nsea.  But this was always on the little porch in front of Captain\nCephas's house, or by his kitchen fire in the winter.  Captain Eli did\nnot like the smell of tobacco smoke in his house, or even in front of\nit in summer-time, when the doors were open.  He had no objection\nhimself to the odor of tobacco, but it was contrary to the principles\nof woman housekeeping that rooms should smell of it, and he was always\ntrue to those principles.\n\nIt was late in a certain December, and through the village there was a\npleasant little flutter of Christmas preparations.  Captain Eli had\nbeen up to the store, and he had stayed there a good while, warming\nhimself by the stove, and watching the women coming in to buy things\nfor Christmas.  It was strange how many things they bought for presents\nor for holiday use--fancy soap and candy, handkerchiefs and little\nwoollen shawls for old people, and a lot of pretty little things which\nhe knew the use of, but which Captain Cephas would never have\nunderstood at all had he been there.\n\nAs Captain Eli came out of the store he saw a cart in which were two\ngood-sized Christmas trees, which had been cut in the woods, and were\ngoing, one to Captain Holmes's house, and the other to Mother Nelson's.\nCaptain Holmes had grandchildren, and Mother Nelson, with never a child\nof her own, good old soul, had three little orphan nieces who never\nwanted for anything needful at Christmas-time or any other time.\n\nCaptain Eli walked home very slowly, taking observations in his mind.\nIt was more than seven years since he had had anything to do with\nChristmas, except that on that day he had always made himself a\nmince-pie, the construction and the consumption of which were equally\ndifficult.  It is true that neighbors had invited him, and they had\ninvited Captain Cephas, to their Christmas dinners, but neither of\nthese worthy seamen had ever accepted any of these invitations.  Even\nholiday food, when not cooked in sailor fashion, did not agree with\nCaptain Cephas, and it would have pained the good heart of Captain Eli\nif he had been forced to make believe to enjoy a Christmas dinner so\nvery inferior to those which Miranda used to set before him.\n\nBut now the heart of Captain Eli was gently moved by a Christmas\nflutter.  It had been foolish, perhaps, for him to go up to the store\nat such a time as this, but the mischief had been done.  Old feelings\nhad come back to him, and he would be glad to celebrate Christmas this\nyear if he could think of any good way to do it.  And the result of his\nmental observations was that he went over to Captain Cephas's house to\ntalk to him about it.\n\nCaptain Cephas was in his kitchen, smoking his third morning pipe.\nCaptain Eli filled his pipe, lighted it, and sat down by the fire.\n\n\"Cap'n,\" said he, \"what do you say to our keepin Christmas this year?\nA Christmas dinner is no good if it's got to be eat alone, and you and\nme might eat ourn together.  It might be in my house, or it might be in\nyour house--it won't make no great difference to me which.  Of course,\nI like woman housekeepin', as is laid down in the rules of service fer\nmy house.  But next best to that I like sailor housekeepin', so I don't\nmind which house the dinner is in, Cap'n Cephas, so it suits you.\"\n\nCaptain Cephas took his pipe from his mouth.  \"You're pretty late\nthinkin' about it,\" said he, \"fer day after to-morrow's Christmas.\"\n\n\"That don't make no difference,\" said Captain Eli.  \"What things we\nwant that are not in my house or your house we can easily get either up\nat the store or else in the woods.\"\n\n\"In the woods!\" exclaimed Captain Cephas.  \"What in the name of thunder\ndo you expect to get in the woods for Christmas?\"\n\n\"A Christmas tree,\" said Captain Eli.  \"I thought it might be a nice\nthing to have a Christmas tree fer Christmas.  Cap'n Holmes has got\none, and Mother Nelson's got another.  I guess nearly everybody's got\none.  It won't cost anything--I can go and cut it.\"\n\nCaptain Cephas grinned a grin, as if a great leak had been sprung in\nthe side of a vessel, stretching nearly from stem to stern.\n\n\"A Christmas tree!\" he exclaimed.  \"Well, I am blessed!  But look here,\nCap'n Eli.  You don't know what a Christmas tree's fer.  It's fer\nchildren, and not fer grown-ups.  Nobody ever does have a Christmas\ntree in any house where there ain't no children.\"\n\nCaptain Eli rose and stood with his back to the fire.  \"I didn't think\nof that,\" he said, \"but I guess it's so.  And when I come to think of\nit, a Christmas isn't much of a Christmas, anyway, without children.\"\n\n\"You never had none,\" said Captain Cephas, \"and you've kept Christmas.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Captain Eli, reflectively, \"we did do it, but there was\nalways a lackment--Miranda has said so, and I have said so.\"\n\n\"You didn't have no Christmas tree,\" said Captain Cephas.\n\n\"No, we didn't.  But I don't think that folks was as much set on\nChristmas trees then as they 'pear to be now.  I wonder,\" he continued,\nthoughtfully gazing at the ceiling, \"if we was to fix up a Christmas\ntree--and you and me's got a lot of pretty things that we've picked up\nall over the world, that would go miles ahead of anything that could be\nbought at the store fer Christmas trees--if we was to fix up a tree\nreal nice, if we couldn't get some child or other that wasn't likely to\nhave a tree to come in and look at it, and stay awhile, and make\nChristmas more like Christmas.  And then, when it went away, it could\ntake along the things that was hangin' on the tree, and keep 'em fer\nits own.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't work,\" said Captain Cephas.  \"If you get a child into\nthis business, you must let it hang up its stockin' before it goes to\nbed, and find it full in the mornin', and then tell it an all-fired lie\nabout Santa Claus if it asks any questions.  Most children think more\nof stockin's than they do of trees--so I've heard, at least.\"\n\n\"I've got no objections to stockin's,\" said Captain Eli.  \"If it wanted\nto hang one up, it could hang one up either here or in my house,\nwherever we kept Christmas.\"\n\n\"You couldn't keep a child all night,\" sardonically remarked Captain\nCephas, \"and no more could I.  Fer if it was to get up a croup in the\nnight, it would be as if we was on a lee shore with anchors draggin'\nand a gale a-blowin'.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Captain Eli.  \"You've put it fair.  I suppose if we\ndid keep a child all night, we'd have to have some sort of a woman\nwithin hail in case of a sudden blow.\"\n\nCaptain Cephas sniffed.  \"What's the good of talkin'?\" said he.  \"There\nain't no child, and there ain't no woman that you could hire to sit all\nnight on my front step or on your front step, a-waitin' to be piped on\ndeck in case of croup.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Captain Eli.  \"I don't suppose there's any child in this\nvillage that ain't goin' to be provided with a Christmas tree or a\nChristmas stockin', or perhaps both--except, now I come to think of it,\nthat little gal that was brought down here with her mother last summer,\nand has been kept by Mrs. Crumley sence her mother died.\"\n\n\"And won't be kept much longer,\" said Captain Cephas, \"fer I've hearn\nMrs. Crumley say she couldn't afford it.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Captain Eli.  \"If she can't afford to keep the little\ngal, she can't afford to give no Christmas trees nor stockin's, and so\nit seems to me, cap'n, that that little gal would be a pretty good\nchild to help us keep Christmas.\"\n\n\"You're all the time forgettin',\" said the other, \"that nuther of us\ncan keep a child all night.\"\n\nCaptain Eli seated himself, and looked ponderingly into the fire.\n\"You're right, cap'n,\" said he.  \"We'd have to ship some woman to take\ncare of her.  Of course, it wouldn't be no use to ask Mrs. Crumley?\"\n\nCaptain Cephas laughed.  \"I should say not.\"\n\n\"And there doesn't seem to be anybody else,\" said his companion.  \"Can\nyou think of anybody, cap'n?\"\n\n\"There ain't anybody to think of,\" replied Captain Cephas, \"unless it\nmight be Eliza Trimmer.  She's generally ready enough to do anything\nthat turns up.  But she wouldn't be no good--her house is too far away\nfor either you or me to hail her in case a croup came up suddint.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Captain Eli.  \"She does live a long way off.\"\n\n\"So that settles the whole business,\" said Captain Cephas.  \"She's too\nfar away to come if wanted, and nuther of us couldn't keep no child\nwithout somebody to come if they was wanted, and it's no use to have a\nChristmas tree without a child.  A Christmas without a Christmas tree\ndon't seem agreeable to you, cap'n, so I guess we'd better get along\njust the same as we've been in the habit of doin', and eat our\nChristmas dinner, as we do our other meals in our own houses.\"\n\nCaptain Eli looked into the fire.  \"I don't like to give up things if I\ncan help it.  That was always my way.  If wind and tide's ag'in' me, I\ncan wait till one or the other, or both of them, serve.\"\n\n \"Yes,\" said Captain Cephas, \"you was always that kind of a\nman.\"\n\n\"That's so.  But it does 'pear to me as if I'd have to give up this\ntime, though it's a pity to do it, on account of the little gal, fer\nshe ain't likely to have any Christmas this year.  She's a nice little\ngal, and takes as natural to navigation as if she'd been born at sea.\nI've given her two or three things because she's so pretty, but there's\nnothing she likes so much as a little ship I gave her.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she was born at sea,\" remarked Captain Cephas.\n\n\"Perhaps she was,\" said the other; \"and that makes it the bigger pity.\"\n\nFor a few moments nothing was said.  Then Captain Eli suddenly\nexclaimed, \"I'll tell you what we might do, cap'n!  We might ask Mrs.\nTrimmer to lend a hand in givin' the little gal a Christmas.  She ain't\ngot nobody in her house but herself, and I guess she'd be glad enough\nto help give that little gal a regular Christmas.  She could go and get\nthe child, and bring her to your house or to my house, or wherever\nwe're goin' to keep Christmas, and--\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Captain Cephas, with an air of scrutinizing inquiry,\n\"what?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied the other, a little hesitatingly, \"so far as I'm\nconcerned,--that is, I don't mind one way or the other,--she might take\nher Christmas dinner along with us and the little gal, and then she\ncould fix her stockin' to be hung up, and help with the Christmas tree,\nand--\"\n\n\"Well,\" demanded Captain Cephas, \"what?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Captain Eli, \"she could--that is, it doesn't make any\ndifference to me one way or the other--she might stay all night at\nwhatever house we kept Christmas in, and then you and me might spend\nthe night in the other house, and then she could be ready there to help\nthe child in the mornin', when she came to look at her stockin'.\"\n\nCaptain Cephas fixed upon his friend an earnest glare.  \"That's pretty\nconsiderable of an idea to come upon you so suddint,\" said he.  \"But I\ncan tell you one thing: there ain't a-goin' to be any such doin's in my\nhouse.  If you choose to come over here to sleep, and give up your\nhouse to any woman you can find to take care of the little gal, all\nright.  But the thing can't be done here.\"\n\nThere was a certain severity in these remarks, but they appeared to\naffect Captain Eli very pleasantly.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"if you're satisfied, I am.  I'll agree to any plan\nyou choose to make.  It doesn't matter to me which house it's in, and\nif you say my house, I say my house.  All I want is to make the\nbusiness agreeable to all concerned.  Now it's time fer me to go to my\ndinner, and this afternoon we'd better go and try to get things\nstraightened out, because the little gal, and whatever woman comes with\nher, ought to be at my house to-morrow before dark.  S'posin' we divide\nup this business: I'll go and see Mrs. Crumley about the little gal,\nand you can go and see Mrs. Trimmer.\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" promptly replied Captain Cephas, \"I don't go to see no Mrs.\nTrimmer.  You can see both of them just the same as you can see\none--they're all along the same way.  I'll go cut the Christmas tree.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Captain Eli.  \"It don't make no difference to me\nwhich does which.  But if I was you, cap'n, I'd cut a good big tree,\nbecause we might as well have a good one while we're about it.\"\n\nWhen he had eaten his dinner, and washed up his dishes, and had put\neverything away in neat, housewifely order, Captain Eli went to Mrs.\nCrumley's house, and very soon finished his business there.  Mrs.\nCrumley kept the only house which might be considered a boarding-house\nin the village of Sponkannis; and when she had consented to take charge\nof the little girl who had been left on her hands she had hoped it\nwould not be very long before she would hear from some of her relatives\nin regard to her maintenance.  But she had heard nothing, and had now\nceased to expect to hear anything, and in consequence had frequently\nremarked that she must dispose of the child some way or other, for she\ncouldn't afford to keep her any longer.  Even an absence of a day or\ntwo at the house of the good captain would be some relief, and Mrs.\nCrumley readily consented to the Christmas scheme.  As to the little\ngirl, she was delighted.  She already looked upon Captain Eli as her\nbest friend in the world.\n\nIt was not so easy to go to Mrs. Trimmer's house and put the business\nbefore her.  \"It ought to be plain sailin' enough,\" Captain Eli said to\nhimself, over and over again, \"but, fer all that, it don't seem to be\nplain sailin'.\"\n\nBut he was not a man to be deterred by difficult navigation, and he\nwalked straight to Eliza Trimmer's house.\n\nMrs. Trimmer was a comely woman about thirty-five, who had come to the\nvillage a year before, and had maintained herself, or at least had\ntried to, by dressmaking and plain sewing.  She had lived at Stetford,\na seaport about twenty miles away, and from there, three years before,\nher husband, Captain Trimmer, had sailed away in a good-sized schooner,\nand had never returned.  She had come to Sponkannis because she thought\nthat there she could live cheaper and get more work than in her former\nhome.  She had found the first quite possible, but her success in\nregard to the work had not been very great.\n\nWhen Captain Eli entered Mrs. Trimmer's little room, he found her busy\nmending a sail.  Here fortune favored him.  \"You turn your hand to\n'most anything, Mrs. Trimmer,\" said he, after he had greeted her.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she answered, with a smile, \"I am obliged to do that.\nMending sails is pretty heavy work, but it's better than nothing.\"\n\n\"I had a notion,\" said he, \"that you was ready to turn your hand to any\ngood kind of business, so I thought I would step in and ask you if\nyou'd turn your hand to a little bit of business I've got on the\nstocks.\"\n\nShe stopped sewing on the sail, and listened while Captain Eli laid his\nplan before her.  \"It's very kind in you and Captain Cephas to think of\nall that,\" said she.  \"I have often noticed that poor little girl, and\npitied her.  Certainly I'll come, and you needn't say anything about\npaying me for it.  I wouldn't think of asking to be paid for doing a\nthing like that.  And besides,\"--she smiled again as she spoke,--\"if\nyou are going to give me a Christmas dinner, as you say, that will make\nthings more than square.\"\n\nCaptain Eli did not exactly agree with her, but he was in very good\nhumor, and she was in good humor, and the matter was soon settled, and\nMrs. Trimmer promised to come to the captain's house in the morning and\nhelp about the Christmas tree, and in the afternoon to go to get the\nlittle girl from Mrs. Crumley's and bring her to the house.\n\nCaptain Eli was delighted with the arrangements.  \"Things now seem to\nbe goin' along before a spankin' breeze,\" said he.  \"But I don't know\nabout the dinner.  I guess you will have to leave that to me.  I don't\nbelieve Captain Cephas could eat a woman-cooked dinner.  He's\naccustomed to livin sailor fashion, you know, and he has declared over\nand over again to me that woman-cookin' doesn't agree with him.\"\n\n\"But I can cook sailor fashion,\" said Mrs. Trimmer,--\"just as much\nsailor fashion as you or Captain Cephas, and if he don't believe it,\nI'll prove it to him; so you needn't worry about that.\"\n\nWhen the captain had gone, Mrs. Trimmer gayly put away the sail.  There\nwas no need to finish it in a hurry, and no knowing when she would get\nher money for it when it was done.  No one had asked her to a Christmas\ndinner that year, and she had expected to have a lonely time of it.\nBut it would be very pleasant to spend Christmas with the little girl\nand the two good captains.  Instead of sewing any more on the sail, she\ngot out some of her own clothes to see if they needed anything done to\nthem.\n\nThe next morning Mrs. Trimmer went to Captain Eli's house, and finding\nCaptain Cephas there, they all set to work at the Christmas tree, which\nwas a very fine one, and had been planted in a box.  Captain Cephas had\nbrought over a bundle of things from his house, and Captain Eli kept\nrunning here and there, bringing, each time that he returned, some new\nobject, wonderful or pretty, which he had brought from China or Japan\nor Corea, or some spicy island of the Eastern seas; and nearly every\ntime he came with these treasures Mrs. Trimmer declared that such\nthings were too good to put upon a Christmas tree, even for such a nice\nlittle girl as the one for which that tree was intended.  The presents\nwhich Captain Cephas brought were much more suitable for the purpose;\nthey were odd and funny, and some of them pretty, but not expensive, as\nwere the fans and bits of shellwork and carved ivories which Captain\nEli wished to tie upon the twigs of the tree.\n\nThere was a good deal of talk about all this, but Captain Eli had his\nown way.\n\n\"I don't suppose, after all,\" said he, \"that the little gal ought to\nhave all the things.  This is such a big tree that it's more like a\nfamily tree.  Cap'n Cephas can take some of my things, and I can take\nsome of his things, and, Mrs. Trimmer, if there's anything you like,\nyou can call it your present and take it for your own, so that will be\nfair and comfortable all round.  What I want is to make everybody\nsatisfied.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I think they ought to be,\" said Mrs. Trimmer, looking very\nkindly at Captain Eli.\n\nMrs. Trimmer went home to her own house to dinner, and in the afternoon\nshe brought the little girl.  She had said there ought to be an early\nsupper, so that the child would have time to enjoy the Christmas tree\nbefore she became sleepy.\n\nThis meal was prepared entirely by Captain Eli, and in sailor fashion,\nnot woman fashion, so that Captain Cephas could make no excuse for\neating his supper at home.  Of course they all ought to be together the\nwhole of that Christmas eve.  As for the big dinner on the morrow, that\nwas another affair, for Mrs. Trimmer undertook to make Captain Cephas\nunderstand that she had always cooked for Captain Trimmer in sailor\nfashion, and if he objected to her plum-duff, or if anybody else\nobjected to her mince-pie, she was going to be very much surprised.\n\nCaptain Cephas ate his supper with a good relish, and was still eating\nwhen the rest had finished.  As to the Christmas tree, it was the most\nvaluable, if not the most beautiful, that had ever been set up in that\nregion.  It had no candles upon it, but was lighted by three lamps and\na ship's lantern placed in the four corners of the room, and the little\ngirl was as happy as if the tree were decorated with little dolls and\nglass balls.  Mrs. Trimmer was intensely pleased and interested to see\nthe child so happy, and Captain Eli was much pleased and interested to\nsee the child and Mrs. Trimmer so happy, and Captain Cephas was\ninterested, and perhaps a little amused in a superior fashion, to see\nCaptain Eli and Mrs. Trimmer and the little child so happy.\n\nThen the distribution of the presents began.  Captain Eli asked Captain\nCephas if he might have the wooden pipe that the latter had brought for\nhis present.  Captain Cephas said he might take it, for all he cared,\nand be welcome to it.  Then Captain Eli gave Captain Cephas a red\nbandanna handkerchief of a very curious pattern, and Captain Cephas\nthanked him kindly.  After which Captain Eli bestowed upon Mrs. Trimmer\na most beautiful tortoise-shell comb, carved and cut and polished in a\nwonderful way, and with it he gave a tortoise-shell fan, carved in the\nsame fashion, because he said the two things seemed to belong to each\nother and ought to go together; and he would not listen to one word of\nwhat Mrs. Trimmer said about the gifts being too good for her, and that\nshe was not likely ever to use them.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Captain Cephas, \"that you might be giving\nsomething to the little gal.\"\n\nThen Captain Eli remembered that the child ought not to be forgotten,\nand her soul was lifted into ecstasy by many gifts, some of which Mrs.\nTrimmer declared were too good for any child in this wide, wide world.\nBut Captain Eli answered that they could be taken care of by somebody\nuntil the little girl was old enough to know their value.\n\nThen it was discovered that, unbeknown to anybody else, Mrs. Trimmer\nhad put some presents on the tree, which were things which had been\nbrought by Captain Trimmer from somewhere in the far East or the\ndistant West.  These she bestowed upon Captain Cephas and Captain Eli.\nAnd the end of all this was that in the whole of Sponkannis, from the\nfoot of the bluff to the east, to the very last house on the shore to\nthe west, there was not one Christmas eve party so happy as this one.\n\nCaptain Cephas was not quite so happy as the three others were, but he\nwas very much interested.  About nine o'clock the party broke up, and\nthe two captains put on their caps and buttoned up their pea-jackets,\nand started for Captain Cephas's house, but not before Captain Eli had\ncarefully fastened every window and every door except the front door,\nand had told Mrs. Trimmer how to fasten that when they had gone, and\nhad given her a boatswain's whistle, which she might blow out of the\nwindow if there should be a sudden croup and it should be necessary for\nany one to go anywhere.  He was sure he could hear it, for the wind was\nexactly right for him to hear a whistle from his house.  When they had\ngone Mrs. Trimmer put the little girl to bed, and was delighted to find\nin what a wonderfully neat and womanlike fashion that house was kept.\n\nIt was nearly twelve o'clock that night when Captain Eli, sleeping in\nhis bunk opposite that of Captain Cephas, was aroused by hearing a\nsound.  He had been lying with his best ear uppermost, so that he\nshould hear anything if there happened to be anything to hear.  He did\nhear something, but it was not a boatswain's whistle; it was a\nprolonged cry, and it seemed to come from the sea.\n\nIn a moment Captain Eli was sitting on the side of his bunk, listening\nintently.  Again came the cry.  The window toward the sea was slightly\nopen, and he heard it plainly.\n\n\"Cap'n!\" said he, and at the word Captain Cephas was sitting on the\nside of his bunk, listening.  He knew from his companion's attitude,\nplainly visible in the light of a lantern which hung on a hook at the\nother end of the room, that he had been awakened to listen.  Again came\nthe cry.\n\n\"That's distress at sea,\" said Captain Cephas.  \"Harken!\"\n\nThey listened again for nearly a minute, when the cry was repeated.\n\n\"Bounce on deck, boys!\" said Captain Cephas, getting out on the floor.\n\"There's some one in distress off shore.\"\n\nCaptain Eli jumped to the floor, and began to dress quickly.\n\n\"It couldn't be a call from land?\" he asked hurriedly.  \"It don't sound\na bit to you like a boatswain's whistle, does it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Captain Cephas, disdainfully.  \"It's a call from sea.\" Then,\nseizing a lantern, he rushed down the companionway.\n\nAs soon as he was convinced that it was a call from sea, Captain Eli\nwas one in feeling and action with Captain Cephas.  The latter hastily\nopened the draughts of the kitchen stove, and put on some wood, and by\nthe time this was done Captain Eli had the kettle filled and on the\nstove.  Then they clapped on their caps and their pea-jackets, each\ntook an oar from a corner in the back hall, and together they ran down\nto the beach.\n\nThe night was dark, but not very cold, and Captain Cephas had been to\nthe store that morning in his boat.\n\nWhenever he went to the store, and the weather permitted, he rowed\nthere in his boat rather than walk.  At the bow of the boat, which was\nnow drawn up on the sand, the two men stood and listened.  Again came\nthe cry from the sea.\n\n\"It's something ashore on the Turtle-back Shoal,\" said Captain Cephas.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Captain Eli, \"and it's some small craft, fer that cry is\ndown pretty nigh to the water.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Captain Cephas.  \"And there's only one man aboard, or else\nthey'd take turns a-hollerin'.\"\n\n\"He's a stranger,\" said Captain Eli, \"or he wouldn't have tried, even\nwith a cat-boat, to get in over that shoal on ebb-tide.\"\n\nAs they spoke they ran the boat out into the water and jumped in, each\nwith an oar.  Then they pulled for the Turtle-back Shoal.\n\nAlthough these two captains were men of fifty or thereabout, they were\nas strong and tough as any young fellows in the village, and they\npulled with steady strokes, and sent the heavy boat skimming over the\nwater, not in a straight line toward the Turtle-back Shoal, but now a\nfew points in the darkness this way, and now a few points in the\ndarkness that way, then with a great curve to the south through the\ndark night, keeping always near the middle of the only good channel out\nof the bay when the tide was ebbing.\n\nNow the cries from seaward had ceased, but the two captains were not\ndiscouraged.\n\n\"He's heard the thumpin' of our oars,\" said Captain Cephas.\n\n\"He's listenin', and he'll sing out again if he thinks we're goin'\nwrong,\" said Captain Eli.  \"Of course he doesn't know anything about\nthat.\"\n\nAnd so when they made the sweep to the south the cry came again, and\nCaptain Eli grinned.  \"We needn't to spend no breath hollerin',\" said\nhe.  \"He'll hear us makin' fer him in a minute.\"\n\nWhen they came to head for the shoal they lay on their oars for a\nmoment, while Captain Cephas turned the lantern in the bow, so that its\nlight shone out ahead.  He had not wanted the shipwrecked person to see\nthe light when it would seem as if the boat were rowing away from him.\nHe had heard of castaway people who became so wild when they imagined\nthat a ship or boat was going away from them that they jumped overboard.\n\nWhen the two captains reached the shoal, they found there a cat-boat\naground, with one man aboard.  His tale was quickly told.  He had\nexpected to run into the little bay that afternoon, but the wind had\nfallen, and in trying to get in after dark, and being a stranger, he\nhad run aground.  If he had not been so cold, he said, he would have\nbeen willing to stay there till the tide rose; but he was getting\nchilled, and seeing a light not far away, he concluded to call for help\nas long as his voice held out.\n\nThe two captains did not ask many questions.  They helped anchor the\ncat-boat, and then they took the man on their boat and rowed him to\nshore.  He was getting chilled sitting out there doing nothing, and so\nwhen they reached the house they made him some hot grog, and promised\nin the morning, when the tide rose, they would go out and help him\nbring his boat in.  Then Captain Cephas showed the stranger to a bunk,\nand they all went to bed.  Such experiences had not enough of novelty\nto the good captains to keep them awake five minutes.\n\nIn the morning they were all up very early, and the stranger, who\nproved to be a seafaring man with bright blue eyes, said that, as his\ncat-boat seemed to be riding all right at its anchorage, he did not\ncare to go out after her just yet.  Any time during flood-tide would do\nfor him, and he had some business that he wanted to attend to as soon\nas possible.\n\nThis suited the two captains very well, for they wished to be on hand\nwhen the little girl discovered her stocking.\n\n\"Can you tell me,\" said the stranger, as he put on his cap, \"where I\ncan find a Mrs. Trimmer, who lives in this village?\"\n\nAt these words all the sturdy stiffness which, from his youth up, had\ncharacterized the legs of Captain Eli entirely went out of them, and he\nsat suddenly upon a bench.  For a few moments there was silence.\n\nThen Captain Cephas, who thought some answer should be made to the\nquestion, nodded his head.\n\n\"I want to see her as soon as I can,\" said the stranger.  \"I have come\nto see her on particular business that will be a surprise to her.  I\nwanted to be here before Christmas began, and that's the reason I took\nthat cat-boat from Stetford, because I thought I'd come quicker that\nway than by land.  But the wind fell, as I told you.  If either one of\nyou would be good enough to pilot me to where Mrs. Trimmer lives, or to\nany point where I can get a sight of the place, I'd be obliged.\"\n\nCaptain Eli rose and with hurried but unsteady steps went into the\nhouse (for they had been upon the little piazza), and beckoned to his\nfriend to follow.  The two men stood in the kitchen and looked at each\nother.  The face of Captain Eli was of the hue of a clam-shell.\n\n\"Go with him, cap'n,\" he said in a hoarse whisper.  \"I can't do it.\"\n\n\"To your house?\" inquired the other.\n\n\"Of course.  Take him to my house.  There ain't no other place where\nshe is.  Take him along.\"\n\nCaptain Cephas's countenance wore an air of the deepest concern, but he\nthought that the best thing to do was to get the stranger away.\n\n As they walked rapidly toward Captain Eli's house there was\nvery little said by either Captain Cephas or the stranger.  The latter\nseemed anxious to give Mrs. Trimmer a surprise, and not to say anything\nwhich might enable another person to interfere with his project.\n\nThe two men had scarcely stepped upon the piazza when Mrs. Trimmer, who\nhad been expecting early visitors, opened the door.  She was about to\ncall out \"Merry Christmas!\" but, her eyes falling upon a stranger, the\nwords stopped at her lips.  First she turned red, then she turned pale,\nand Captain Cephas thought she was about to fall.  But before she could\ndo this the stranger had her in his arms.  She opened her eyes, which\nfor a moment she had closed, and, gazing into his face, she put her\narms around his neck.  Then Captain Cephas came away, without thinking\nof the little girl and the pleasure she would have in discovering her\nChristmas stocking.\n\nWhen he had been left alone, Captain Eli sat down near the kitchen\nstove, close to the very kettle which he had filled with water to heat\nfor the benefit of the man he had helped bring in from the sea, and,\nwith his elbows on his knees and his fingers in his hair, he darkly\npondered.\n\n\"If I'd only slept with my hard-o'-hearin' ear up,\" he said to himself,\n\"I'd never have heard it.\"\n\nIn a few moments his better nature condemned this thought.\n\n\"That's next to murder,\" he muttered, \"fer he couldn't have kept\nhimself from fallin' asleep out there in the cold, and when the tide\nriz held have been blowed out to sea with this wind.  If I hadn't heard\nhim, Captain Cephas never would, fer he wasn't primed up to wake, as I\nwas.\"\n\nBut, notwithstanding his better nature, Captain Eli was again saying to\nhimself, when his friend returned, \"If I'd only slept with my other ear\nup!\"\n\nLike the honest, straightforward mariner he was, Captain Cephas made an\nexact report of the facts.  \"They was huggin' when I left them,\" he\nsaid, \"and I expect they went indoors pretty soon, fer it was too cold\noutside.  It's an all-fired shame she happened to be in your house,\ncap'n, that's all I've got to say about it. It's a thunderin' shame.\"\n\nCaptain Eli made no answer.  He still sat with his elbows on his knees\nand his hands in his hair.\n\n\"A better course than you laid down fer these Christmas times was never\ndotted on a chart,\" continued Captain Cephas.  \"From port of sailin' to\nport of entry you laid it down clear and fine.  But it seems there was\nrocks that wasn't marked on the chart.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" groaned Captain Eli, \"there was rocks.\"\n\nCaptain Cephas made no attempt to comfort his friend, but went to work\nto get breakfast.\n\nWhen that meal--a rather silent one--was over, Captain Eli felt better.\n\"There was rocks,\" he said, \"and not a breaker to show where they lay,\nand I struck 'em bow on.  So that's the end of that voyage.  But I've\ntuk to my boats, cap'n, I've tuk to my boats.\"\n\n\"I'm glad to hear you've tuk to your boats,\" said Captain Cephas, with\nan approving glance upon his friend.\n\nAbout ten minutes afterwards Captain Eli said, \"I'm goin' up to my\nhouse.\"\n\n\"By yourself?\" said the other.\n\n\"Yes, by myself.  I'd rather go alone.  I don't intend to mind\nanything, and I'm goin' to tell her that she can stay there and spend\nChristmas,--the place she lives in ain't no place to spend\nChristmas,--and she can make the little gal have a good time, and go\n'long just as we intended to go 'long--plum-duff and mince-pie all the\nsame.  I can stay here, and you and me can have our Christmas dinner\ntogether, if we choose to give it that name.  And if she ain't ready to\ngo to-morrow, she can stay a day or two longer.  It's all the same to\nme, if it's the same to you, cap'n.\"\n\nCaptain Cephas having said that it was the same to him, Captain Eli put\non his cap and buttoned up his pea-jacket, declaring that the sooner he\ngot to his house the better, as she might be thinking that she would\nhave to move out of it now that things were different.\n\nBefore Captain Eli reached his house he saw something which pleased\nhim.  He saw the sea-going stranger, with his back toward him, walking\nrapidly in the direction of the village store.\n\nCaptain Eli quickly entered his house, and in the doorway of the room\nwhere the tree was he met Mrs. Trimmer, beaming brighter than any\nmorning sun that ever rose.\n\n\"Merry Christmas!\" she exclaimed, holding out both her hands.  \"I've\nbeen wondering and wondering when you'd come to bid me `Merry\nChristmas'--the merriest Christmas I've ever had.\"\n\nCaptain Eli took her hands and bid her \"Merry Christmas\" very gravely.\n\nShe looked a little surprised.  \"What's the matter, Captain Eli?\" she\nexclaimed.  \"You don't seem to say that as if you meant it.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I do,\" he answered.  \"This must be an all-fired--I mean a\nthunderin' happy Christmas fer you, Mrs. Trimmer.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, her face beaming again.  \"And to think that it should\nhappen on Christmas day--that this blessed morning, before anything\nelse happened, my Bob, my only brother, should--\"\n\n\"Your what!\" roared Captain Eli, as if he had been shouting orders in a\nraging storm.\n\nMrs. Trimmer stepped back almost frightened.  \"My brother,\" said she.\n\"Didn't he tell you he was my brother--my brother Bob, who sailed away\na year before I was married, and who has been in Africa and China and I\ndon't know where?  It's so long since I heard that he'd gone into\ntrading at Singapore that I'd given him up as married and settled in\nforeign parts.  And here he has come to me as if he'd tumbled from the\nsky on this blessed Christmas morning.\"\n\nCaptain Eli made a step forward, his face very much flushed.\n\n\"Your brother, Mrs. Trimmer--did you really say it was your brother?\"\n\n\"Of course it is,\" said she.  \"Who else could it be?\"  Then she paused\nfor a moment and looked steadfastly at the captain.\n\n\"You don't mean to say, Captain Eli,\" she asked, \"that you thought it\nwas--\"\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" said Captain Eli, promptly.\n\nMrs. Trimmer looked straight in the captain's eyes, then she looked on\nthe ground.  Then she changed color and changed back again.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said hesitatingly, \"why--I mean what\ndifference it made.\"\n\n\"Difference!\" exclaimed Captain Eli.  \"It was all the difference\nbetween a man on deck and a man overboard--that's the difference it was\nto me.  I didn't expect to be talkin' to you so early this Christmas\nmornin', but things has been sprung on me, and I can't help it I just\nwant to ask you one thing:  Did you think I was gettin' up this\nChristmas tree and the Christmas dinner and the whole business fer the\ngood of the little gal, and fer the good of you, and fer the good of\nCaptain Cephas?\"\n\nMrs. Trimmer had now recovered a very fair possession of herself.  \"Of\ncourse I did,\" she answered, looking up at him as she spoke.  \"Who else\ncould it have been for!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"you were mistaken.  It wasn't fer any one of you.  It\nwas all fer me--fer my own self.\"\n\n\"You yourself?\" said she.  \"I don't see how.\"\n\n\"But I see how,\" he answered.  \"It's been a long time since I wanted to\nspeak my mind to you, Mrs. Trimmer, but I didn't ever have no chance.\nAnd all these Christmas doin's was got up to give me the chance not\nonly of speakin' to you, but of showin' my colors better than I could\nshow them in any other way.  Everything went on a-skimmin' till this\nmornin', when that stranger that we brought in from the shoal piped up\nand asked fer you.  Then I went overboard--at least, I thought I\ndid--and sunk down, down, clean out of soundin's.\"\n\n\"That was too bad, captain,\" said she, speaking very gently, \"after all\nyour trouble and kindness.\"\n\n\"But I don't know now,\" he continued, \"whether I went overboard or\nwhether I am on deck.  Can you tell me, Mrs. Trimmer?\"\n\nShe looked up at him.  Her eyes were very soft, and her lips trembled\njust a little.  \"It seems to me, captain,\" she said, \"that you are on\ndeck--if you want to be.\"\n\nThe captain stepped closer to her.  \"Mrs. Trimmer,\" said he, \"is that\nbrother of yours comin' back?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered, surprised at the sudden question.  \"He's just gone\nup to the store to buy a shirt and some things.  He got himself\nsplashed trying to push his boat off last night.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Captain Eli, \"would you mind tellin' him when he\ncomes back that you and me's engaged to be married?  I don't know\nwhether I've made a mistake in the lights or not, but would you mind\ntellin' him that?\"\n\nMrs. Trimmer looked at him.  Her eyes were not so soft as they had\nbeen, but they were brighter.  \"I'd rather you'd tell him that\nyourself,\" said she.\n\nThe little girl sat on the floor near the Christmas tree, just\nfinishing a large piece of red-and-white candy which she had taken out\nof her stocking.  \"People do hug a lot at Christmas-time,\" said she to\nherself.  Then she drew out a piece of blue-and-white candy and began\non that.\n\nCaptain Cephas waited a long time for his friend to return, and at last\nhe thought it would be well to go and look for him.  When he entered\nthe house he found Mrs. Trimmer sitting on the sofa in the parlor, with\nCaptain Eli on one side of her and her brother on the other, and each\nof them holding one of her hands.\n\n\"It looks as if I was in port, don't it?\" said Captain Eli to his\nastonished friend.  \"Well, here I am, and here's my fust mate,\"\ninclining his head toward Mrs. Trimmer.  \"And she's in port too, safe\nand sound.  And that strange captain on the other side of her, he's her\nbrother Bob, who's been away for years and years, and is just home from\nMadagascar.\"\n\n\"Singapore,\" amended Brother Bob.\n\nCaptain Cephas looked from one to the other of the three occupants of\nthe sofa, but made no immediate remark.  Presently a smile of genial\nmaliciousness stole over his face, and he asked, \"How about the poor\nlittle gal?  Have you sent her back to Mrs. Crumley's?\"\n\nThe little girl came out from behind the Christmas tree, her stocking,\nnow but half filled, in her hand.  \"Here I am,\" she said.  \"Don't you\nwant to give me a Christmas hug, Captain Cephas?  You and me's the only\nones that hasn't had any.\"\n\nThe Christmas dinner was as truly and perfectly a sailor-cooked meal as\never was served on board a ship or off it.  Captain Cephas had said\nthat, and when he had so spoken there was no need of further words.\n\nIt was nearly dark that afternoon, and they were all sitting around the\nkitchen fire, the three seafaring men smoking, and Mrs. Trimmer greatly\nenjoying it.  There could be no objection to the smell of tobacco in\nthis house so long as its future mistress enjoyed it.  The little girl\nsat on the floor nursing a Chinese idol which had been one of her\npresents.\n\n\"After all,\" said Captain Eli, meditatively, \"this whole business come\nout of my sleepin' with my best ear up.  Fer if I'd slept with my\nhard-o'-hearin' ear up--\"  Mrs. Trimmer put one finger on his lips.\n\"All right,\" said Captain Eli, \"I won't say no more.  But it would have\nbeen different.\"\n\nEven now, several years after that Christmas, when there is no Mrs.\nTrimmer, and the little girl, who has been regularly adopted by Captain\nEli and his wife, is studying geography, and knows more about latitude\nand longitude than her teacher at school, Captain Eli has still a\nslight superstitious dread of sleeping with his best ear uppermost.\n\n\"Of course it's the most all-fired nonsense,\" he says to himself over\nand over again.  Nevertheless, he feels safer when it is his\n\"hard-o'-hearin' ear\" that is not upon the pillow.\n\n\n\n\nLOVE BEFORE BREAKFAST\n\nI was still a young man when I came into the possession of an excellent\nestate.  This consisted of a large country house, surrounded by lawns,\ngroves, and gardens, and situated not far from the flourishing little\ntown of Boynton.  Being an orphan with no brothers or sisters, I set up\nhere a bachelor's hall, in which, for two years, I lived with great\nsatisfaction and comfort, improving my grounds and furnishing my house.\nWhen I had made all the improvements which were really needed, and\nfeeling that I now had a most delightful home to come back to, I\nthought it would be an excellent thing to take a trip to Europe, give\nmy mind a run in fresh fields, and pick up a lot of bric-a-brac and\nideas for the adornment and advantage of my house and mind.\n\nIt was the custom of the residents in my neighborhood who owned houses\nand travelled in the summer to let their houses during their absence,\nand my business agent and myself agreed that this would be an excellent\nthing for me to do.  If the house were let to a suitable family it\nwould yield me a considerable income, and the place would not present\non my return that air of retrogression and desolation which I might\nexpect if it were left unoccupied and in charge of a caretaker.\n\nMy agent assured me that I would have no trouble whatever in letting my\nplace, for it offered many advantages and I expected but a reasonable\nrent.  I desired to leave everything just as it stood, house,\nfurniture, books, horses, cows, and poultry, taking with me only my\nclothes and personal requisites, and I desired tenants who would come\nin bringing only their clothes and personal requisites, which they\ncould quietly take away with them when their lease should expire and I\nshould return home.\n\nIn spite, however, of the assurances of the agent, it was not easy to\nlet my place.  The house was too large for some people, too small for\nothers, and while some applicants had more horses than I had stalls in\nmy stable, others did not want even the horses I would leave.  I had\nengaged my steamer passage, and the day for my departure drew near, and\nyet no suitable tenants had presented themselves.  I had almost come to\nthe conclusion that the whole matter would have to be left in the hands\nof my agent, for I had no intention whatever of giving up my projected\ntravels, when early one afternoon some people came to look at the\nhouse.  Fortunately I was at home, and I gave myself the pleasure of\npersonally conducting them about the premises.  It was a pleasure,\nbecause as soon as I comprehended the fact that these applicants\ndesired to rent my house I wished them to have it.\n\nThe family consisted of an elderly gentleman and his wife, with a\ndaughter of twenty or thereabout.  This was a family that suited me\nexactly.  Three in number, no children, people of intelligence and\nposition, fond of the country, and anxious for just such a place as I\noffered them--what could be better?\n\nThe more I walked about and talked with these good people and showed\nthem my possessions, the more I desired that the young lady should take\nmy house.  Of course her parents were included in this wish, but it was\nfor her ears that all my remarks were intended, although sometimes\naddressed to the others, and she was the tenant I labored to obtain.  I\nsay \"labored\" advisedly, because I racked my brain to think of\ninducements which might bring them to a speedy and favorable decision.\n\nApart from the obvious advantages of the arrangement, it would be a\npositive delight to me during my summer wanderings in Europe to think\nthat that beautiful girl would be strolling through my grounds,\nenjoying my flowers, and sitting with her book in the shady nooks I had\nmade so pleasant, lying in my hammocks, spending her evening hours in\nmy study, reading my books, writing at my desk, and perhaps musing in\nmy easy-chair.  Before these applicants appeared it had sometimes\npained me to imagine strangers in my home; but no such thought crossed\nmy mind in regard to this young lady, who, if charming in the house and\non the lawn, grew positively entrancing when she saw my Jersey cows and\nmy two horses, regarding them with an admiration which even surpassed\nmy own.\n\nLong before we had completed the tour of inspection I had made up my\nmind that this young lady should come to live in my house.  If\nobstacles should show themselves they should be removed.  I would tear\ndown, I would build, I would paper and paint, I would put in all sorts\nof electric bells, I would reduce the rent until it suited their\nnotions exactly, I would have my horses' tails banged if she liked that\nkind of tails better than long ones--I would do anything to make them\ndefinitely decide to take the place before they left me.  I trembled to\nthink of her going elsewhere and giving other householders a chance to\ntempt her.  She had looked at a good many country houses, but it was\nquite plain that none of them had pleased her so well as mine.\n\nI left them in my library to talk the matter over by themselves, and in\nless than ten minutes the young lady herself came out on the lawn to\ntell me that her father and mother had decided to take the place and\nwould like to speak with me.\n\n\"I am so glad,\" she said as we went in.  \"I am sure I shall enjoy every\nhour of our stay here.  It is so different from anything we have yet\nseen.\"\n\nWhen everything had been settled I wanted to take them again over the\nplace and point out a lot of things I had omitted.  I particularly\nwanted to show them some lovely walks in the woods.  But there was no\ntime, for they had to catch a train.\n\nHer name was Vincent--Cora Vincent, as I discovered from her mother's\nremarks.\n\nAs soon as they departed I had my mare saddled and rode into town to\nsee my agent.  I went into his office exultant.\n\n\"I've let my house,\" I said, \"and I want you to make out the lease and\nhave everything fixed and settled as soon as possible.  This is the\naddress of my tenants.\"\n\nThe agent asked me a good many questions, being particularly anxious to\nknow what rent had been agreed upon.\n\n\"Heavens!\" he exclaimed, when I mentioned the sum, \"that is ever so\nmuch less than I told you you could get.  I am in communication now\nwith a party whom I know would pay you considerably more than these\npeople.  Have you definitely settled with them?  Perhaps it is not too\nlate to withdraw.\"\n\n\"Withdraw!\" I cried.  \"Never!  They are the only tenants I want.  I was\ndetermined to get them, and I think I must have lowered the rent four\nor five times in the course of the afternoon.  I took a big slice out\nof it before I mentioned the sum at all.  You see,\" said I, very\nimpressively, \"these Vincents exactly suit me.\"  And then I went on to\nstate fully the advantages of the arrangement, omitting, however, any\nreferences to my visions of Miss Vincent swinging in my hammocks or\nmusing in my study-chair.\n\nIt was now May 15, and my steamer would sail on the twenty-first.  The\nintervening days I employed, not in preparing for my travels, but in\nmaking every possible arrangement for the comfort and convenience of my\nincoming tenants.  The Vincents did not wish to take possession until\nJune 1, and I was sorry they had not applied before I had engaged my\npassage, for in that case I would have selected a later date.  A very\ngood steamer sailed on June 3, and it would have suited me just as well.\n\nHappening to be in New York one day, I went to the Vincents' city\nresidence to consult with them in regard to some awnings which I\nproposed putting up at the back of the house.  I found no one at home\nbut the old gentleman, and it made no difference to him whether the\nawnings were black and brown or red and yellow.  I cordially invited\nhim to come out before I left, and bring his family, that they might\nlook about the place to see if there was anything they would like to\nhave done which had not already been attended to.  It was so much\nbetter, I told him, to talk over these matters personally with the\nowner than with an agent in his absence.  Agents were often very\nunwilling to make changes.  Mr. Vincent was a very quiet and\nexceedingly pleasant elderly gentleman, and thanked me very much for my\ninvitation, but said he did not see how he could find the time to get\nout to my house before I sailed.  I did not like to say that it was not\nat all necessary for him to neglect his affairs in order to accompany\nhis family to my place, but I assured him that if any of them wished to\ngo out at any time before they took possession they must feel at\nperfect liberty to do so.\n\nI mentioned this matter to my agent, suggesting that if he happened to\nbe in New York he might call on the Vincents and repeat my invitation.\nIt was not likely that the old gentleman would remember to mention it\nto his wife and daughter, and it was really important that everything\nshould be made satisfactory before I left.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" he said, smiling a little grimly, \"that the Vincents\nhad better be kept away from your house until you have gone.  If you do\nanything more to it you may find out that it would have been more\nprofitable to have shut it up while you are away.\"\n\nHe did call, however, partly because I wished him to and partly because\nhe was curious to see the people  I was so anxious to install in my\nhome, and to whom he was to be my legal representative.  He reported\nthe next day that he had found no one at home but Miss Vincent, and\nthat she had said that she and her mother would be very glad to come\nout the next week and go over the place before they took possession.\n\n\"Next week!\" I exclaimed.  \"I shall be gone then!\"\n\n\"But I shall be here,\" said Mr. Barker, \"and I'll show them about and\ntake their suggestions.\"\n\nThis did not suit me at all.  It annoyed me very much to think of\nBarker showing Miss Vincent about my place.  He was a good-looking\nyoung man and not at all backward in his manners.\n\n\"After all,\" said I, \"I suppose that everything that ought to be done\nhas been done.  I hope you told her that.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said he.  \"That would have been running dead against\nyour orders.  Besides, it's my business to show people about places.  I\ndon't mind it.\"\n\nThis gave me an unpleasant and uneasy feeling.  I wondered if Mr.\nBarker were the agent I ought to have, and if a middle-aged man with a\nfamily and more experience might not be better able to manage my\naffairs.\n\n\"Barker,\" said I, a little later, \"there will be no use of your going\nevery month to the Vincents to collect their rent.  I shall write to\nMr. Vincent to pay as he pleases.  He can send a check monthly or at\nthe end of the season, as it may be convenient.  He is perfectly\nresponsible, and I would much prefer to have the money in a lump when I\ncome back.\"\n\nBarker grinned.  \"All right,\" said he, \"but that's not the way to do\nbusiness, you know.\"\n\nI may have been mistaken, but I fancied that I saw in my agent's face\nan expression which indicated that he intended to call on the first day\nof each month, on the pretext of telling Vincent that it was not\nnecessary to pay the rent at any particular time, and that he also\nproposed to make many other intervening visits to inquire if repairs\nwere needed.  This might have been a good deal to get out of his\nexpression, but I think I could have got more if I had thought longer.\n\nOn the day before that on which I was to sail, my mind was in such a\ndisturbed condition that I could not attend to my packing or anything\nelse.  It almost enraged me to think that I was deliberately leaving\nthe country ten days before my tenants would come to my house.  There\nwas no reason why I should do this.  There were many reasons why I\nshould not.  There was Barker.  I was now of the opinion that he would\npersonally superintend the removal of the Vincents and their\nestablishment to my home.  I remembered that the only suggestion he had\nmade about the improvement of the place had been the construction of a\ntennis-court.  I knew that he was a champion player.  Confound it!\nWhat a dreadful mistake I had made in selecting such a man for my\nhouse-agent.  With my mind's eye I could already see Miss Vincent and\nBarker selecting a spot for tennis and planning the arrangements of the\ncourt.\n\nI took the first train to New York and went directly to the steamboat\noffice.  It is astonishing how many obstacles can be removed from a\nman's path if he will make up his mind to give them a good kick.  I\nfound that my steamer was crowded.  The applications for passage\nexceeded the accommodations, and the agent was delighted to transfer me\nto the steamer that sailed on June 3.  I went home exultant.  Barker\ndrove over in the evening to take his last instructions, and a blank\nlook came over his face when I told him that business had delayed my\ndeparture, and that I should not sail the next day.  If I had told him\nthat part of that business was the laying out of a tennis-court he\nmight have looked blanker.\n\nOf course the date of my departure did not concern the Vincents,\nprovided the house was vacated by June 1, and I did not inform them of\nthe change in my plans, but when the mother and daughter came out the\nnext week they were much surprised to find me waiting to receive them\ninstead of Barker.  I hope that they were also pleased, and I am sure\nthat they had every reason to be so.  Mrs. Vincent, having discovered\nthat I was a most complacent landlord, accommodated herself easily to\nmy disposition and made a number of minor requirements, all of which I\ngranted without the slightest hesitation.  I was delighted at last to\nput her into the charge of my housekeeper, and when the two had betaken\nthemselves to the bedrooms I invited Miss Vincent to come out with me\nto select a spot for a tennis-court.  The invitation was accepted with\nalacrity, for tennis, she declared, was a passion with her.\n\nThe selection of that tennis-court took nearly an hour, for there were\nseveral good places for one and it was hard to make a selection;\nbesides, I could not lose the opportunity of taking Miss Vincent into\nthe woods and showing her the walks I had made and the rustic seats I\nhad placed in pleasant nooks.  Of course she would have discovered\nthese, but it was a great deal better for her to know all about them\nbefore she came.  At last Mrs. Vincent sent a maid to tell her daughter\nthat it was time to go for the train, and the court had not been\ndefinitely planned.\n\nThe next day I went to Miss Vincent's house with a plan of the grounds,\nand she and I talked it over until the matter was settled.  It was\nnecessary to be prompt about this, I explained, as there would be a\ngreat deal of levelling and rolling to be done.\n\nI also had a talk with the old gentleman about books.  There were\nseveral large boxes of my books in New York which I had never sent out\nto my country house.  Many of these I thought might be interesting to\nhim, and I offered to have them taken out and left at his disposal.\nWhen he heard the titles of some of the books in the collection he was\nmuch interested, but insisted that before he made use of them they\nshould be catalogued, as were the rest of my effects.  I hesitated a\nmoment, wondering if I could induce Barker to come to New York and\ncatalogue four big boxes of books, when, to my surprise, Miss Vincent\nincidentally remarked that if they were in any place where she could\nget at them she would be pleased to help catalogue them; that sort of\nthing was a great pleasure to her.  Instantly I proposed that I should\nsend the books to the Vincent house, that they should there be taken\nout so that Mr. Vincent could select those he might care to read during\nthe summer, that I would make a list of these, and if Vincent would\nassist me I would be grateful for the kindness, and those that were not\ndesired could be returned to the storehouse.\n\nWhat a grand idea was this!  I had been internally groaning because I\ncould think of no possible pretence, for further interviews with Miss\nVincent, and here was something better than I could have imagined.  Her\nfather declared that he could not put me to so much trouble, but I\nwould listen to none of his words, and the next morning my books were\nspread over his library floor.\n\nThe selection and cataloguing of the volumes desired occupied the\nmornings of three days.  The old gentleman's part was soon done, but\nthere were many things in the books which were far more interesting to\nme than their titles, and to which I desired to draw Miss Vincent's\nattention.  All this greatly protracted our labors.  She was not only a\nbeautiful girl, but her intelligence and intellectual grasp were\nwonderful.  I could not help telling her what a great pleasure it would\nbe to me to think, while wandering in foreign lands, that such an\nappreciative family would be enjoying my books and my place.\n\n\"You are so fond of your house and everything you have,\" said she,\n\"that we shall almost feel as if we were depriving you of your rights.\nBut I suppose that Italian lakes and the Alps will make you forget for\na time even your beautiful home.\"\n\n\"Not if you are in it,\" I longed to say, but I restrained myself.  I\ndid not believe that it was possible for me to be more in love with\nthis girl than I was at that moment, but, of course, it would be the\nrankest stupidity to tell her so.  To her I was simply her father's\nlandlord.\n\nI went to that house the next day to see that the boxes were\nproperly repacked, and I actually went the next day to see if the right\nboxes had gone into the country, and the others back to the storehouse.\nThe first day I saw only the father.  The second day it was the mother\nwho assured me that everything had been properly attended to.  I began\nto feel that if I did not wish a decided rebuff I would better not make\nany more pretences of business at the Vincent house.\n\nThere were affairs of my own which should have been attended to, and I\nought to have gone home and attended to them, but I could not bear to\ndo so.  There was no reason to suppose she would go out there before\nthe first of June.\n\nThinking over the matter many times, I came to the conclusion that if I\ncould see her once more I would be satisfied.  Then I would go away,\nand carry her image with me into every art-gallery, over every glacier,\nand under every lovely sky that I should enjoy abroad, hoping all the\ntime that, taking my place, as it were, in my home, and making my\npossessions, in a measure, her own, she would indirectly become so well\nacquainted with me that when I returned I might speak to her without\nshocking her.\n\nTo obtain this final interview there was but one way.  I had left my\nhouse on Saturday, the Vincents would come on the following Monday, and\nI would sail on Wednesday.  I would go on Tuesday to inquire if they\nfound everything to their satisfaction.  This would be a very proper\nattention from a landlord about to leave the country.\n\nWhen I reached Boynton I determined to walk to my house, for I did not\nwish to encumber myself with a hired vehicle.  I might be asked to stay\nto luncheon.  A very strange feeling came over me as I entered my\ngrounds.  They were not mine.  For the time being they belonged to\nsomebody else.  I was merely a visitor or a trespasser if the Vincents\nthought proper so to consider me.  If they did not like people to walk\non the grass I had no right to do it.\n\nNone of my servants had been left on the place, and the maid who came\nto the door informed me that Mr. Vincent had gone to New York that\nmorning, and that Mrs. Vincent and her daughter were out driving.  I\nventured to ask if she thought they would soon return, and she answered\nthat she did not think they would, as they had gone to Rock Lake,\nwhich, from the way they talked about it, must be a long way off.\n\nRock Lake!  When I had driven over there with my friends, we had taken\nluncheon at the inn and returned in the afternoon.  And what did they\nknow of Rock Lake?  Who had told them of it?  That officious Barker, of\ncourse.\n\n\"Will you leave a message, sir?\" said the maid, who, of course, did not\nknow me.\n\n\"No,\" said I, and as I still stood gazing at the piazza floor, she\nremarked that if I wished to call again she would go out and speak to\nthe coachman and ask him if anything had been said to him about the\ntime of the party's return.\n\nWorse and worse!  Their coachman had not driven them!  Some one who\nknew the country had been their companion.  They were not acquainted in\nthe neighborhood, and there could not be a shadow of a doubt that it\nwas that obtrusive Barker who had indecently thrust himself upon them\non the very next day after their arrival, and had thus snatched from me\nthis last interview upon which I had counted so earnestly.\n\nI had no right to ask any more questions.  I left no message nor any\nname, and I had no excuse for saying I would call again.\n\nI got back to my hotel without having met any one whom I knew, and that\nnight I received a note from Barker, stating that he had fully intended\ncoming to the steamer to see me off, but that an engagement would\nprevent him.  He sent, however, his best good wishes for my safe\npassage, and assured me that he would keep me fully informed of the\nstate of my affairs on this side.\n\n\"Engagement!\" I exclaimed.  \"Is he going to drive with her again\nto-morrow?\"\n\nMy steamer sailed at two o'clock the next day, and after an early\nbreakfast I went to the company's office to see if I could dispose of\nmy ticket.  It had become impossible, I told the agent, for me to leave\nAmerica at present.  He said it was a very late hour to sell my ticket,\nbut that he would do what he could, and if an applicant turned up he\nwould give him my room and refund the money.  He wanted me to change to\nanother date, but I declined to do this.  I was not able to say when I\nshould sail.\n\nI now had no plan of action.  All I knew was that I could not leave\nAmerica without finding out something definite about this Barker\nbusiness.  That is to say, if it should be made known to me that\ninstead of attending to my business, sending a carpenter to make\nrepairs, if such were necessary, or going personally to the plumber to\nmake sure that that erratic personage would give his attention to any\npipes in regard to which Mr. Vincent might have written, Barker should\nmingle in sociable relations with my tenants, and drive or play tennis\nwith the young lady of the house, then would I immediately have done\nwith him.  I would withdraw my business from his hands and place it in\nthose of old Mr. Poindexter.  More than that, it might be my duty to\nwarn Miss Vincent's parents against Barker.  I did not doubt that he\nwas a very good house and land-agent, but in selecting him as such I\nhad no idea of introducing him to the Vincents in a social way.  In\nfact, the more I thought about it the more I became convinced that if\never I mentioned Barker to my tenants it would be to warn them against\nhim.  From certain points of view he was actually a dangerous man.\n\nThis, however, I would not do until I found my agent was really\nculpable.  To discover what Barker had done, what he was doing, and\nwhat he intended to do, was now my only business in life.  Until I had\nsatisfied myself on these points I could not think of starting out upon\nmy travels.\n\nNow that I had determined I would not start for Europe until I had\nsatisfied myself that Mr. Barker was contenting himself with attending\nto my business, and not endeavoring to force himself into social\nrelations with my tenants, I was anxious that the postponement of my\njourney should be unknown to my friends and acquaintances, and I was,\ntherefore, very glad to see in a newspaper, published on the afternoon\nof the day of my intended departure, my name among the list of\npassengers who had sailed upon the Mnemonic.  For the first time I\ncommended the super-enterprise of a reporter who gave more attention to\nthe timeliness of his news than to its accuracy.\n\nI was stopping at a New York hotel, but I did not wish to stay there.\nUntil I felt myself ready to start on my travels the neighborhood of\nBoynton would suit me better than anywhere else.  I did not wish to go\nto the town itself, for Barker lived there, and I knew many of the\ntownspeople; but there were farmhouses not far away where I might spend\na week.  After considering the matter, I thought of something that\nmight suit me.  About three miles from my house, on an unfrequented\nroad, was a mill which stood at the end of an extensive sheet of water,\nin reality a mill-pond, but commonly called a lake.  The miller, an old\nman, had recently died, and his house near by was occupied by a\nnewcomer whom I had never seen.  If I could get accommodations there it\nwould suit me exactly.  I left the train two stations below Boynton and\nwalked over to the mill.\n\nThe country-folk in my neighborhood are always pleased to take summer\nboarders if they can get them, and the miller and his wife were glad to\ngive me a room, not imagining that I was the owner of a good house not\nfar away.  The place suited my requirements very well.  It was near\nher, and I might live here for a time unnoticed, but what I was going\nto do with my opportunity I did not know.  Several times the conviction\nforced itself upon me that I should get up at once and go to Europe by\nthe first steamer, and so show myself that I was a man of sense.\n\nThis conviction was banished on the second afternoon of my stay at the\nmill.  I was sitting under a tree in the orchard near the house,\nthinking and smoking my pipe, when along the road which ran by the side\nof the lake came Mr. Vincent on my black horse General and his daughter\non my mare Sappho.  Instinctively I pulled my straw hat over my eyes,\nbut this precaution was not necessary.  They were looking at the\nbeautiful lake, with its hills and overhanging trees, and saw me not!\n\nWhen the very tip of Sappho's tail had melted into the foliage of the\nroad, I arose to my feet and took a deep breath of the happy air.  I\nhad seen her, and it was with her father she was riding.\n\nI do not believe I slept a minute that night through thinking of her,\nand feeling glad that I was near her, and that she had been riding with\nher father.\n\nWhen the early dawn began to break an idea brighter than the dawn broke\nupon me: I would get up and go nearer to her.  It is amazing how much\nwe lose by not getting up early on the long summer days.  How beautiful\nthe morning might be on this earth I never knew until I found myself\nwandering by the edge of my woods and over my lawn with the tender\ngray-blue sky above me and all the freshness of the grass and flowers\nand trees about me, the birds singing among the branches, and she\nsleeping sweetly somewhere within that house with its softly defined\nlights and shadows.  How I wished I knew what room she occupied!\n\nThe beauties and joys of that hour were lost to every person on the\nplace, who were all, no doubt, in their soundest sleep.  I did not even\nsee a dog.  Quietly and stealthily stepping from bush to hedge, I went\naround the house, and as I drew near the barn I fancied I could hear\nfrom a little room adjoining it the snores of the coachman.  The lazy\nrascal would probably not awaken for two or three hours yet, but I\nwould ran no risks, and in half an hour I had sped away.\n\nNow I knew exactly why I was staying at the house of the miller.  I was\ndoing so in order that I might go early in the mornings to my own home,\nin which the girl I loved lay dreaming, and that for the rest of the\nday and much of the night I might think of her.\n\n\"What place in Europe,\" I said to myself, \"could be so beautiful, so\ncharming, and so helpful to reflection as this sequestered lake, these\nnoble trees, these stretches of undulating meadow?\"\n\nEven if I should care to go abroad, a month or two later would answer\nall my purposes.  Why had I ever thought of spending five months away?\n\nThere was a pretty stream which ran from the lake and wended its way\nthrough a green and shaded valley, and here, with a rod, I wandered and\nfished and thought.  The miller had boats, and in one of these I rowed\nfar up the lake where it narrowed into a creek, and between the high\nhills which shut me out from the world I would float and think.\n\nEvery morning, soon after break of day, I went to my home and wandered\nabout my grounds.  If it rained I did not mind that.  I like a summer\nrain.\n\nDay by day I grew bolder.  Nobody in that household thought of getting\nup until seven o'clock.  For two hours, at least, I could ramble\nundisturbed through my grounds, and much as I had once enjoyed these\ngrounds, they never afforded me the pleasure they gave me now.  In\nthese happy mornings I felt all the life and spirits of a boy.  I went\ninto my little field and stroked the sleek sides of my cows as they\nnibbled the dewy grass.  I even peeped through the barred window of\nSappho's box and fed her, as I had been used to doing, with bunches of\nclover.  I saw that the young chickens were flourishing.  I went into\nthe garden and noted the growth of the vegetables, feeling glad that\nshe would have so many fine strawberries and tender peas.\n\nI had not the slightest doubt that she was fond of flowers, and for her\nsake now, as I used to do for my own sake, I visited the flower beds\nand borders.  Not far from the house there was a cluster of\nold-fashioned pinks which I was sure were not doing very well.  They\nhad been there too long, perhaps, and they looked stunted and weak.  In\nthe miller's garden I had noticed great beds of these pinks, and I\nasked his wife if I might have some, and she, considering them as mere\nwild flowers, said I might have as many as I liked.  She might have\nthought I wanted simply the blossoms, but the next morning I went over\nto my house with a basket filled with great matted masses of the plants\ntaken up with the roots and plenty of earth around them, and after\ntwenty minutes' work in my own bed of pinks, I had taken out all the\nold plants and filled their places with fresh, luxuriant masses of buds\nand leaves and blossoms.  How glad she would be when she saw the fresh\nlife that had come to that flower-bed!  With light footsteps I went\naway, not feeling the weight of the basket filled with the old plants\nand roots.\n\nThe summer grew and strengthened, and the sun rose earlier, but as that\nhad no effect upon the rising of the present inhabitants of my place,\nit gave me more time for my morning pursuits.  Gradually I constituted\nmyself the regular flower-gardener of the premises.  How delightful the\nwork was, and how foolish I thought I had been never to think of doing\nthis thing for myself! but no doubt it was because I was doing it for\nher that I found it so pleasant.\n\nOnce again I had seen Miss Vincent.  It was in the afternoon, and I had\nrowed myself to the upper part of the lake, where, with the high hills\nand the trees on each side of me, I felt as if I were alone in the\nworld.  Floating, idly along, with my thoughts about three miles away,\nI heard the sound of oars, and looking out on the open part of the\nlake, I saw a boat approaching.  The miller was rowing, and in the\nstern sat an elderly gentleman and a young lady.  I knew them in an\ninstant: they were Mr. and Miss Vincent.\n\nWith a few vigorous strokes I shot myself into the shadows, and rowed\nup the stream into the narrow stretches among the lily-pads, under a\nbridge, and around a little wooded point, where I ran the boat ashore\nand sprang upon the grassy bank.  Although I did not believe the miller\nwould bring them as far as this, I went up to a higher spot and watched\nfor half an hour; but I did not see them again.  How relieved I was!\nIt would have been terribly embarrassing had they discovered me.  And\nhow disappointed I was that the miller turned back so soon!\n\nI now extended the supervision of my grounds.  I walked through the\nwoods, and saw how beautiful they were in the early dawn.  I threw\naside the fallen twigs and cut away encroaching saplings, which were\nbeginning to encumber the paths I had made, and if I found a bough\nwhich hung too low I cut it off.  There was a great beech-tree, between\nwhich and a dogwood I had the year before suspended a hammock.  In\npassing this, one morning, I was amazed to see a hammock swinging from\nthe hooks I had put in the two trees.  This was a retreat which I had\nsupposed no one else would fancy or even think of!  In the hammock was\na fan--a common Japanese fan.  For fifteen minutes I stood looking at\nthat hammock, every nerve a-tingle.  Then I glanced around.  The spot\nhad been almost unfrequented since last summer.  Little bushes, weeds,\nand vines had sprung up here and there between the two trees.  There\nwere dead twigs and limbs lying about, and the short path to the main\nwalk was much overgrown.\n\nI looked at my watch.  It was a quarter to six.  I had yet a good hour\nfor work, and with nothing but my pocket-knife and my hands I began to\nclear away the space about that hammock.  When I left it, it looked as\nit used to look when it was my pleasure to lie there and swing and read\nand reflect.\n\nTo approach this spot it was not necessary to go through my grounds,\nfor my bit of woods adjoined a considerable stretch of forest-land, and\nin my morning walks from the mill I often used a path through these\nwoods.  The next morning when I took this path I was late because I had\nunfortunately overslept myself.  When I reached the hammock it wanted\nfifteen minutes to seven o'clock.  It was too late for me to do\nanything, but I was glad to be able to stay there even for a few\nminutes, to breathe that air, to stand on that ground, to touch that\nhammock.  I did more than that.  Why shouldn't I?  I got into it.  It\nwas a better one than that I had hung there.  It was delightfully\ncomfortable.  At this moment, gently swinging in that woodland\nsolitude, with the sweet odors of the morning all about me, I felt\nmyself nearer to her than I had ever been before.\n\nBut I knew I must not revel in this place too long.  I was on the point\nof rising to leave when I heard approaching footsteps.  My breath\nstopped.  Was I at last to be discovered?  This was what came of my\nreckless security.  But perhaps the person, some workman most likely,\nwould pass without noticing me.  To remain quiet seemed the best\ncourse, and I lay motionless.\n\nBut the person approaching turned into the little pathway.  The\nfootsteps came nearer.  I sprang from the hammock.  Before me was Miss\nVincent!\n\nWhat was my aspect I know not, but I have no doubt I turned fiery red.\nShe stopped suddenly, but she did not turn red.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Ripley,\" she exclaimed, \"good morning!  You must excuse me.  I\ndid not know--\"\n\nThat she should have had sufficient self-possession to say good morning\namazed me.  Her whole appearance, in fact, amazed me.  There seemed to\nbe something wanting in her manner.  I endeavored to get myself into\ncondition.\n\n\"You must be surprised,\" I said, \"to see me here.  You supposed I was\nin Europe, but--\"\n\nAs I spoke I made a couple of steps toward her, but suddenly stopped.\nOne of my coat buttons had caught in the meshes of the hammock.  It was\nconfoundedly awkward.  I tried to loosen the button, but it was badly\nentangled.  Then I desperately pulled at it to tear it off.\n\n\"Oh, don't do that,\" she said.  \"Let me unfasten it for you.\" And\ntaking the threads of the hammock in one of her little hands and the\nbutton in the other, she quickly separated them.  \"I should think\nbuttons would be very inconvenient things--at least, in hammocks,\" she\nsaid smiling.  \"You see, girls don't have any such trouble.\"\n\nI could not understand her manner.  She seemed to take my being there\nas a matter of course.\n\n\"I must beg a thousand pardons for this--this trespass,\" I said.\n\n\"Trespass!\" said she, with a smile.  \"People don't trespass on their\nown land--\"\n\n\"But it is not my land,\" said I.  \"It is your father's for the time\nbeing.  I have no right here whatever.  I do not know how to explain,\nbut you must think it very strange to find me here when you supposed I\nhad started for Europe.\"\n\n\"Oh!  I knew you had not started for Europe,\" said she, \"because I have\nseen you working in the grounds--\"\n\n\"Seen me!\" I interrupted.  \"Is it possible?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said she.  \"I don't know how long you had been coming when I\nfirst saw you, but when I found that fresh bed of pinks all\ntransplanted from somewhere, and just as lovely as they could be,\ninstead of the old ones, I spoke to the man; but he did not know\nanything about it, and said he had not had time to do anything to the\nflowers, whereas I had been giving him credit for ever so much weeding\nand cleaning up.  Then I supposed that Mr. Barker, who is just as kind\nand attentive as he can be, had done it; but I could hardly believe he\nwas the sort of man to come early in the morning and work out of\ndoors,\"--(\"Oh, how I wish he had come!\" I thought.  \"If I had caught\nhim here working among the flowers!\"),--\"and when he came that\nafternoon to play tennis I found that he had been away for two days,\nand could not have planted the pinks.  So I simply got up early one\nmorning and looked out, and there I saw you, with your coat off,\nworking just as hard as ever you could.\"\n\nI stepped back, my mind for a moment a perfect blank.\n\n\"What could you have thought of me?\" I exclaimed presently.\n\n\"Really, at first I did not know what to think,\" said she.  \"Of course\nI did not know what had detained you in this country, but I remembered\nthat I had heard that you were a very particular person about your\nflowers and shrubs and grounds, and that most likely you thought they\nwould be better taken care of if you kept an eye on them, and that when\nyou found there was so much to do you just went to work and did it.  I\ndid not speak of this to anybody, because if you did not wish it to be\nknown that you were taking care of the grounds it was not my business\nto tell people about it.  But yesterday, when I found this place where\nI had hung my hammock so beautifully cleared up and made so nice and\nclean and pleasant in every way, I thought I must come down to tell you\nhow much obliged I am, and also that you ought not to take so much\ntrouble for us.  If you think the grounds need more attention, I will\npersuade my father to hire another man, now and then, to work about the\nplace.  Really, Mr. Ripley, you ought not to have to--\"\n\nI was humbled, abashed.  She had seen me at my morning devotions, and\nthis was the way she interpreted them.  She considered me an overnice\nfellow who was so desperately afraid his place would be injured that he\ncame sneaking around every morning to see if any damage had been done\nand to put things to rights.\n\nShe stood for a moment as if expecting me to speak, brushed a buzzing\nfly from her sleeve, and then, looking at me with a gentle smile, she\nturned a little as if she were about to leave.\n\nI could not let her go without telling her something.  Her present\nopinion of me must not rest in her mind another minute.  And yet, what\nstory could I devise?  How, indeed, could I devise anything with which\nto deceive a girl who spoke and looked at me as this girl did?  I could\nnot do it.  I must rush away speechless and never see her again, or I\nmust tell her all.  I came a little nearer to her.\n\n\"Miss Vincent,\" said I, \"you do not understand at all why I am\nhere--why I have been here so much--why I did not go to Europe.  The\ntruth is, I could not leave.  I do not wish to be away; I want to come\nhere and live here always--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" she interrupted, \"of course it is natural that you should\nnot want to tear yourself away from your lovely home.  It would be very\nhard for us to go away now, especially for father and me, for we have\ngrown to love this place so much.  But if you want us to leave, I dare\nsay--\"\n\n\"I want you to leave!\" I exclaimed.  \"Never!  When I say that I want to\nlive here myself, that my heart will not let me go anywhere else, I\nmean that I want you to live here too--you, your mother and\nfather--that I want--\"\n\n \"Oh, that would be perfectly splendid!\" she said.  \"I have\never so often thought that it was a shame that you should be deprived\nof the pleasures you so much enjoy, which I see you can find here and\nnowhere else.  Now, I have a plan which I think will work splendidly.\nWe are a very small family.  Why shouldn't you come here and live with\nus?  There is plenty of room, and I know father and mother would be\nvery glad, and you can pay your board, if that would please you better.\nYou can have the room at the top of the tower for your study and your\nsmoking den, and the room under it can be your bedroom, so you can be\njust as independent as you please of the rest of us, and you can be\nliving on your own place without interfering with us in the least.  In\nfact, it would be ever so nice, especially as I am in the habit of\ngoing away to the sea-shore with my aunt every summer for six weeks,\nand I was thinking how lonely it would be this year for father and\nmother to stay here all by themselves.\"\n\nThe tower and the room under it!  For me!  What a contemptibly\nlittle-minded and insignificant person she must think me.  The words\nwith which I strove to tell her that I wished to live here as lord,\nwith her as my queen, would not come.  She looked at me for a moment as\nI stood on the brink of saying something but not saying it, and then\nshe turned suddenly toward the hammock.\n\n\"Did you see anything of a fan I left here?\" she said.  \"I know I left\nit here, but when I came yesterday it was gone.  Perhaps you may have\nnoticed it somewhere--\"\n\nNow, the morning before, I had taken that fan home with me.  It was an\nawkward thing to carry, but I had concealed it under my coat.  It was a\ncontemptible trick, but the fan had her initials on it, and as it was\nthe only thing belonging to her of which I could possess myself, the\ntemptation had been too great to resist.  As she stood waiting for my\nanswer there was a light in her eye which illuminated my perceptions.\n\n\"Did you see me take that fan?\" I asked.\n\n\"I did,\" said she.\n\n\"Then you know,\" I exclaimed, stepping nearer to her, \"why it is I did\nnot leave this country as I intended, why it was impossible for me to\ntear myself away from this house, why it is that I have been here every\nmorning, hovering around and doing the things I have been doing?\"\n\nShe looked up at me, and with her eyes she said, \"How could I help\nknowing?\"  She might have intended to say something with her lips, but\nI took my answer from her eyes, and with the quick impulse of a lover I\nstopped her speech.\n\n\"You have strange ways,\" she said presently, blushing and gently\npressing back my arm.  \"I haven't told you a thing.\"\n\n\"Let us tell each other everything now,\" I cried, and we seated\nourselves in the hammock.\n\nIt was a quarter of an hour later and we were still sitting together in\nthe hammock.\n\n\"You may think,\" said she, \"that, knowing what I did, it was very queer\nfor me to come out to you this morning, but I could not help it.  You\nwere getting dreadfully careless, and were staying so late and doing\nthings which people would have been bound to notice, especially as\nfather is always talking about our enjoying the fresh hours of the\nmorning, that I felt I could not let you go on any longer.  And when it\ncame to that fan business I saw plainly that you must either\nimmediately start for Europe or--\"\n\n\"Or what?\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Or go to my father and regularly engage yourself as a--\"\n\nI do not know whether she was going to say \"gardener\" or not, but it\ndid not matter.  I stopped her.\n\nIt was perhaps twenty minutes later, and we were standing together at\nthe edge of the woods.  She wanted me to come to the house to take\nbreakfast with them.\n\n\"Oh, I could not do that!\" I said.  \"They would be so surprised.  I\nshould have so much to explain before I could even begin to state my\ncase.\"\n\n\"Well, then, explain,\" said she.  \"You will find father on the front\npiazza.  He is always there before breakfast, and there is plenty of\ntime.  After all that has been said here, I cannot go to breakfast and\nlook commonplace while you run away.\"\n\n\"But suppose your father objects?\" said I.\n\n\"Well, then you will have to go back and take breakfast with your\nmiller,\" said she.\n\nI never saw a family so little affected by surprises as those Vincents.\nWhen I appeared on the front piazza the old gentleman did not jump.  He\nshook hands with me and asked me to sit down, and when I told him\neverything he did not even ejaculate, but simply folded his hands\ntogether and looked out over the railing.\n\n\"It seemed strange to Mrs. Vincent and myself,\" he said, \"when we first\nnoticed your extraordinary attachment for our daughter, but, after all,\nit was natural enough.\"\n\n\"Noticed it!\" I exclaimed.  \"When did you do that?\"\n\n\"Very soon,\" he said.  \"When you and Cora were cataloguing the books at\nmy house in town I noticed it and spoke to Mrs. Vincent, but she said\nit was nothing new to her, for it was plain enough on the day when we\nfirst met you here that you were letting the house to Cora, and that\nshe had not spoken of it to me because she was afraid I might think it\nwrong to accept the favorable and unusual arrangements you were making\nwith us if I suspected the reason for them.  We talked over the matter,\nbut, of course, we could do nothing, because there was nothing to do,\nand Mrs. Vincent was quite sure you would write to us from Europe.  But\nwhen my man Ambrose told me he had seen some one working about the\nplace in the very early morning, and that, as it was a gentleman, he\nsupposed it must be the landlord, for nobody else would be doing such\nthings, Mrs. Vincent and I looked out of the window the next day, and\nwhen we found it was indeed you who were coming here every day, we felt\nthat the matter was serious and were a good deal troubled.  We found,\nhowever, that you were conducting affairs in a very honorable\nway,--that you were not endeavoring to see Cora, and that you did not\ntry to have any secret correspondence with her,--and as we had no right\nto prevent you from coming on your grounds, we concluded to remain\nquiet until you should take some step which we would be authorized to\nnotice.  Later, when Mr. Barker came and told me that you had not gone\nto Europe, and were living with a miller not far from here--\"\n\n\"Barker!\" I cried.  \"The scoundrel!\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, sir,\" said Mr. Vincent.  \"He spoke with the greatest\nkindness of you, and said that as it was evident you had your own\nreasons for wishing to stay in the neighborhood, and did not wish the\nfact to be known, he had spoken of it to no one but me, and he would\nnot have done this had he not thought it would prevent embarrassment in\ncase we should meet.\"\n\nWould that everlasting Barker ever cease meddling in my affairs?\n\n\"Do you suppose,\" I asked, \"that he imagined the reason for my staying\nhere?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" said the old gentleman, \"but after the questions I put\nto him I have no doubt he suspected it.  I made many inquiries of him\nregarding you, your family, habits, and disposition, for this was a\nvery vital matter to me, sir, and I am happy to inform you that he said\nnothing of you that was not good, so I urged him to keep the matter to\nhimself.  I determined, however, that if you continued your morning\nvisits I should take an early opportunity of accosting you and asking\nan explanation.\"\n\n\"And you never mentioned anything of this to your daughter?\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he answered.  \"We carefully kept everything from her.\"\n\n\"But, my dear sir,\" said I, rising, \"you have given me no answer.  You\nhave not told me whether or not you will accept me as a son-in-law.\"\n\nHe smiled.  \"Truly,\" he said, \"I have not answered you; but the fact\nis, Mrs. Vincent and I have considered the matter so long, and having\ncome to the conclusion that if you made an honorable and\nstraightforward proposition, and if Cora were willing to accept you, we\ncould see no reason to object to--\"\n\nAt this moment the front door opened and Cora appeared.\n\n\"Are you going to stay to breakfast?\" she asked.  \"Because, if you are,\nit is ready.\"\n\nI stayed to breakfast.\n\nI am now living in my own house, not in the two tower rooms, but in the\nwhole mansion, of which my former tenant, Cora, is now mistress\nsupreme.  Mr. and Mrs. Vincent expect to spend the next summer here and\ntake care of the house while we are travelling.\n\nMr. Barker, an excellent fellow and a most thorough business man, still\nmanages my affairs, and there is nothing on the place that flourishes\nso vigorously as the bed of pinks which I got from the miller's wife.\n\nBy the way, when I went back to my lodging on that eventful day, the\nmiller's wife met me at the door.\n\n\"I kept your breakfast waitin' for you for a good while,\" said she,\n\"but as you didn't come, I supposed you were takin' breakfast in your\nown house, and I cleared it away.\"\n\n\"Do you know who I am?\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir,\" she said.  \"We did not at first, but when everybody\nbegan to talk about it we couldn't help knowin' it.\"\n\n\"Everybody!\" I gasped.  \"And may I ask what you and everybody said\nabout me?\"\n\n\"I think it was the general opinion, sir,\" said she, \"that you were\nsuspicious of them tenants of yours, and nobody wondered at it, for\nwhen city people gets into the country and on other people's property,\nthere's no trustin' them out of your sight for a minute.\"\n\nI could not let the good woman hold this opinion of my tenants, and I\nbriefly told her the truth.  She looked at me with moist admiration in\nher eyes.\n\n\"I am glad to hear that, sir,\" said she.  \"I like it very much.  But if\nI was you I wouldn't be in a hurry to tell my husband and the people in\nthe neighborhood about it.  They might be a little disappointed at\nfirst, for they had a mighty high opinion of you when they thought that\nyou was layin' low here to keep an eye on them tenants of yours.\"\n\n\n\n\nTHE STAYING POWER OF SIR ROHAN\n\nDuring the winter in which I reached my twenty fifth year I lived with\nmy mother's brother, Dr. Alfred Morris, in Warburton, a small country\ntown, and I was there beginning the practice of medicine.  I had been\ngraduated in the spring, and my uncle earnestly advised me to come to\nhim and act as his assistant, which advice, considering the fact that\nhe was an elderly man, and that I might hope to succeed him in his\nexcellent practice, was considered good advice by myself and my family.\n\nAt this time I practised very little, but learned a great deal, for as\nI often accompanied my uncle on his professional visits, I could not\nhave taken a better postgraduate course.\n\nI had an invitation to spend the Christmas of that year with the\nCollingwoods, who had opened their country house, about twelve miles\nfrom Warburton, for the entertainment of a holiday house party.  I had\ngladly accepted the invitation, and on the day before Christmas I went\nto the livery stable in the village to hire a horse and sleigh for the\ntrip.  At the stable I met Uncle Beamish, who had also come to hire a\nconveyance.\n\n\"Uncle Beamish,\" as he was generally called in the village, although I\nam sure he had no nephews or nieces in the place, was an elderly man\nwho had retired from some business, I know not what, and was apparently\nquite able to live upon whatever income he had.  He was a good man,\nrather illiterate, but very shrewd.  Generous in good works, I do not\nthink he was fond of giving away money, but his services were at the\ncall of all who needed them.\n\nI liked Uncle Beamish very much, for he was not only a good\nstory-teller, but he was willing to listen to my stories, and when I\nfound he wanted to hire a horse and sleigh to go to the house of his\nmarried sister, with whom he intended to spend Christmas, and that his\nsister lived on Upper Hill turnpike, on which road the Collingwood\nhouse was situated, I proposed that we should hire a sleigh together.\n\n\"That will suit me,\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"There couldn't have been a\nbetter fit if I had been measured for it.  Less than half a mile after\nyou turn into the turnpike, you pass my sister's house.  Then you can\ndrop me and go on to the Collingwoods', which I should say isn't more\nthan three miles further.\"\n\nThe arrangement was made, a horse and sleigh ordered, and early in the\nafternoon we started from Warburton.\n\nThe sleighing was good, but the same could not be said of the horse.\nHe was a big roan, powerful and steady, but entirely too deliberate in\naction.  Uncle Beamish, however, was quite satisfied with him.\n\n\"What you want when you are goin' to take a journey with a horse,\" said\nhe, \"is stayin' power.  Your fast trotter is all very well for a mile\nor two, but if I have got to go into the country in winter, give me a\nhorse like this.\"\n\nI did not agree with him, but we jogged along quite pleasantly until\nthe afternoon grew prematurely dark and it began to snow.\n\n\"Now,\" said I, giving the roan a useless cut, \"what we ought to have is\na fast horse, so that we may get there before there is a storm.\"\n\n\"No, doctor, you're wrong,\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"What we want is a\nstrong horse that will take us there whether it storms or not, and we\nhave got him.  And who cares for a little snow that won't hurt nobody?\"\n\nI did not care for snow, and we turned up our collars and went as\nmerrily as people can go to the music of slowly jingling sleigh-bells.\n\nThe snow began to fall rapidly, and, what was worse, the wind blew\ndirectly in our faces, so that sometimes my eyes were so plastered up\nwith snowflakes that I could scarcely see how to drive.  I never knew\nsnow to fall with such violence.  The roadway in front of us, as far as\nI could see it, was soon one unbroken stretch of white from fence to\nfence.\n\n\"This is the big storm of the season,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"and it is a\ngood thing we started in time, for if the wind keeps blowin', this road\nwill be pretty hard to travel in a couple of hours.\"\n\nIn about half an hour the wind lulled a little and I could get a better\nview of our surroundings, although I could not see very far through the\nswiftly descending snow.\n\n\"I was thinkin',\" said Uncle Beamish, \"that it might be a good idee,\nwhen we get to Crocker's place, to stop a little, and let you warm your\nfingers and nose.  Crocker's is ruther more than half-way to the pike.\"\n\n\"Oh, I do not want to stop anywhere,\" I replied quickly.  \"I am all\nright.\"\n\nNothing was said for some time, and then Uncle Beamish remarked:\n\n\"I don't want to stop any more than you do, but it does seem strange\nthat we ain't passed Crocker's yit.  We could hardly miss his house, it\nis so close to the road.  This horse is slow, but I tell you one thing,\ndoctor, he's improvin'.  He is goin' better than he did.  That's the\nway with this kind.  It takes them a good while to get warmed up, but\nthey keep on gettin' fresher instead of tireder.\"\n\nThe big roan was going better, but still we did not reach Crocker's,\nwhich disappointed Uncle Beamish, who wanted to be assured that the\ngreater part of his journey was over.\n\n\"We must have passed it,\" he said, \"when the snow was so blindin'.\"\n\nI did not wish to discourage him by saying that I did not think we had\nyet reached Crocker's, but I believed I had a much better appreciation\nof our horse's slowness than he had.\n\nAgain the wind began to blow in our faces, and the snow fell faster,\nbut the violence of the storm seemed to encourage our horse, for his\npace was now greatly increased.\n\n\"That's the sort of beast to have,\" exclaimed Uncle Beamish,\nspluttering as the snow blew in his mouth.  \"He is gettin' his spirits\nup just when they are most wanted.  We must have passed Crocker's a\ngood while ago, and it can't be long before we get to the pike.  And\nit's time we was there, for it's darkenin'.\"\n\nOn and on we went, but still we did not reach the pike.  We had lost a\ngreat deal of time during the first part of the journey, and although\nthe horse was travelling so much better now, his pace was below the\naverage of good roadsters.\n\n\"When we get to the pike,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"you can't miss it, for\nthis road doesn't cross it.  All you've got to do is to turn to the\nleft, and in ten minutes you will see the lights in my sister's house.\nAnd I'll tell you, doctor, if you would like to stop there for the\nnight, she'd be mighty glad to have you.\"\n\n\"Much obliged,\" replied I, \"but I shall go on.  It's not late yet, and\nI can reach the Collingwoods' in good time.\"\n\nWe now drove on in silence, our horse actually arching his neck as he\nthumped through the snow.  Drifts had begun to form across the road,\nbut through these he bravely plunged.\n\n\"Stayin' power is what we want, doctor!\" exclaimed Uncle Beamish.\n\"Where would your fast trotter be in drifts like these, I'd like to\nknow?  We got the right horse when we got this one, but I wish we had\nbeen goin' this fast all the time.\"\n\nIt grew darker and darker, but at last we saw, not far in front of us,\na light.\n\n\"That beats me,\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"I don't remember no other house\nso near the road.  It can't be we ain't passed Crocker's yit!  If we\nain't got no further than that, I'm in favor of stoppin'.  I'm not\nafraid of a snow-storm, but I ain't a fool nuther, and if we haven't\ngot further than Crocker's it will be foolhardy to try to push on\nthrough the dark and these big drifts, which will be gettin' bigger.\"\n\nI did not give it up so easily.  I greatly wished to` reach my\ndestination that night.  But there were three wills in the party, and\none of them belonged to the horse.  Before I had any idea of such a\nthing, the animal made a sudden turn,--too sudden for safety,--passed\nthrough a wide gateway, and after a few rapid bounds which, to my\nsurprise, I could not restrain, he stopped suddenly.\n\n\"Hello!\" exclaimed Uncle Beamish, peering forward, \"here's a barn\ndoor.\"  And he immediately began to throw off the far robe that covered\nour knees.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"I'm goin' to open the barn door and let the horse go in,\" said he.\n\"He seems to want to.  I don't know whether this is Crocker's barn or\nnot.  It don't look like it, but I may be mistaken.  Anyway, we will\nlet the horse in, and then go to the house.  This ain't no night to be\ntravellin' any further, doctor, and that is the long and the short of\nit.  If the people here ain't Crockers, I guess they are Christians!\"\n\nI had not much time to consider the situation, for while he had been\nspeaking, Uncle Beamish had waded through the snow, and finding the\nbarn door unfastened, had slid it to one side.  Instantly the horse\nentered the dark barn, fortunately finding nothing in his way.\n\n\"Now,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"if we can get somethin' to tie him with, so\nthat he don't do no mischief, we can leave him here and go up to the\nhouse.\"  I carried a pocket lantern, and quickly lighted it.  \"By\nGeorge!\" said Uncle Beamish, as I held up the lantern, \"this ain't much\nof a barn--it's no more than a wagon-house.  It ain't Crocker's--but no\nmatter; we'll go up to the house.  Here is a hitchin'-rope.\"\n\nWe fastened the horse, threw a robe over him, shut the barn door behind\nus, and slowly made our way to the back of the house, in which there\nwas a lighted window.  Mounting a little portico, we reached a door,\nand were about to knock when it was opened for us.  A woman, plainly a\nservant, stood in a kitchen, light and warm.\n\n\"Come right in,\" she said.  \"I heard your bells.  Did you put your\nhorse in the barn?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"and now we would like to see--\"\n\n\"All right,\" interrupted the woman, moving toward an inner door.  \"Just\nwait here for a minute.  I'm going up to tell her.\"\n\n\"I don't know this place,\" said Uncle Beamish, as we stood by the\nkitchen stove, \"but I expect it belongs to a widow woman.\"\n\n\"What makes you think that?\" I asked.\n\n\"'Cause she said she was goin' to tell HER.  If there had been a man in\nthe house, she would have gone to tell HIM.\"\n\nIn a few moments the woman returned.\n\n\"She says you are to take off your wet things and then go into the\nsitting-room.  She'll be down in a minute.\"\n\nI looked at Uncle Beamish, thinking it was his right to make\nexplanations, but, giving me a little wink, he began to take off his\novercoat.  It was plain to perceive that Uncle Beamish desired to\nassume that a place of refuge would be offered us.\n\n\"It's an awful bad night,\" he said to the woman, as he sat down to take\noff his arctic overshoes.\n\n\"It's all that,\" said she.  \"You may hang your coats over them chairs.\nIt won't matter if they do drip on this bare floor.  Now, then, come\nright into the sitting-room.\"\n\nIn spite of my disappointment, I was glad to be in a warm house, and\nhoped we might be able to stay there.  I could hear the storm beating\nfuriously against the window-panes behind the drawn shades.  There was\na stove in the sitting-room, and a large lamp.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said the woman.  \"She will be here in a minute.\"\n\n\"It strikes me,\" said Uncle Beamish, when we were left alone, \"that\nsomebody is expected in this house, most likely to spend Christmas, and\nthat we are mistook for them, whoever they are.\"\n\n\"I have the same idea,\" I replied, \"and we must explain as soon as\npossible.\"\n\n\"Of course we will do that,\" said he, \"but I can tell you one thing:\nwhoever is expected ain't comin', for he can't get here.  But we've got\nto stay here tonight, no matter who comes or doesn't come, and we've\ngot to be keerful in speakin' to the woman of the house.  If she is one\nkind of a person, we can offer to pay for lodgin's and horse-feed; but\nif she is another kind, we must steer clear of mentionin' pay, for it\nwill make her angry.  You had better leave the explainin' business to\nme.\"\n\nI was about to reply that I was more than willing to do so when the\ndoor opened and a person entered--evidently the mistress of the house.\nShe was tall and thin, past middle age, and plainly dressed.  Her pale\ncountenance wore a defiant look, and behind her spectacles blazed a\npair of dark eyes, which, after an instant's survey of her visitors,\nwere fixed steadily upon me.  She made but a step into the room, and\nstood holding the door.  We both rose from our chairs.\n\n\"You can sit down again,\" she said sharply to me.  \"I don't want you.\nNow, sir,\" she continued, turning to Uncle Beamish, \"please come with\nme.\"\n\nUncle Beamish gave a glance of surprise at me, but he immediately\nfollowed the old lady out of the room, and the door was closed behind\nthem.\n\nFor ten minutes, at least, I sat quietly waiting to see what would\nhappen next--very much surprised at the remark that had been made to\nme, and wondering at Uncle Beamish's protracted absence.  Suddenly he\nentered the room and closed the door.\n\n\"Here's a go!\" said he, slapping his leg, but very gently.  \"We're\nmistook the worst kind.  We're mistook for doctors.\" \"That is only half\na mistake,\" said I.  \"What is the matter, and what can I do?\"\n\n\"Nothin',\" said he, quickly,--\"that is, nothin' your own self.  Just\nthe minute she got me outside that door she began pitchin' into you.\n`I suppose that's young Dr. Glover,' said she.  I told her it was, and\nthen she went on to say, givin' me no chance to explain nothin', that\nshe didn't want to have anything to do with you; that she thought it\nwas a shame to turn people's houses into paupers' hospitals for the\npurpose of teachin' medical students; that she had heard of you, and\nwhat she had heard she hadn't liked.  All this time she kept goin'\nupstairs, and I follerin' her, and the fust thing I knowed she opened a\ndoor and went into a room, and I went in after her, and there, in a\nbed, was a patient of some kind.  I was took back dreadful, for the\nstate of the case came to me like a flash.  Your uncle had been sent\nfor, and I was mistook for him.  Now, what to say was a puzzle to me,\nand I began to think pretty fast.  It was an awkward business to have\nto explain things to that sharp-set old woman.  The fact is, I didn't\nknow how to begin, and was a good deal afraid, besides, but she didn't\ngive me no time for considerin'.  `I think it's her brain,' said she,\n`but perhaps you'll know better.  Catherine, uncover your head!'  And\nwith that the patient turned over a little and uncovered her head,\nwhich she had had the sheet over.  It was a young woman, and she gave\nme a good look, but she didn't say nothin'.  Now I WAS in a state of\nmind.\"\n\n\"Of course you must have been,\" I answered.  \"Why didn't you tell her\nthat you were not a doctor, but that I was.  It would have been easy\nenough to explain matters.  She might have thought my uncle could not\ncome and he had sent me, and that you had come along for company.  The\npatient ought to be attended to without delay.\"\n\n\"She's got to be-attended to,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"or else there will\nbe a row and we'll have to travel--storm or no storm.  But if you had\nheard what that old woman said about young doctors, and you in\nparticular, you would know that you wasn't goin' to have anything to do\nwith this case--at least, you wouldn't show in it.  But I've got no\nmore time for talkin'.  I came down here on business.  When the old\nlady said, `Catherine, hold out your hand!' and she held it out, I had\nnothin' to do but step up and feel her pulse.  I know how to do that,\nfor I have done a lot of nussin' in my life.  And then it seemed\nnat'ral to ask her to put out her tongue, and when she did it I gave a\nlook at it and nodded my head.  `Do you think it is her brain?' said\nthe old woman, half whisperin'.  `Can't say anything about that yit,'\nsaid I.  `I must go down-stairs and get the medicine-case.  The fust\nthing to do is to give her a draught, and I will bring it up to her as\nsoon as it is mixed.'  You have got a pocket medicine-case with you,\nhaven't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said I.  \"It is in my overcoat.\"\n\n\"I knowed it,\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"An old doctor might go visitin'\nwithout his medicine-case, but a young one would be sure to take it\nalong, no matter where he was goin'.  Now you get it, please, quick.\"\n\n\"My notion is,\" said he, when I returned from the kitchen with the\ncase, \"that you mix somethin' that might soothe her a little, if she\nhas got anything the matter with her brain, and which won't hurt her if\nshe hasn't.  And then, when I take it up to her, you tell me what\nsymptoms to look for.  I can do it--I have spent nights lookin' for\nsymptoms.  Then, when I come down and report, you might send her up\nsomethin' that would keep her from gettin' any wuss till the doctor can\ncome in the mornin', for he ain't comin' here to-night.\"\n\n\"A very good plan,\" said I.  \"Now, what can I give her?  What is the\npatient's age?\"\n\n\"Oh, her age don't matter much,\" said Uncle Beamish, impatiently.  \"She\nmay be twenty, more or less, and any mild stuff will do to begin with.\"\n\n\"I will give her some sweet spirits of nitre,\" said I, taking out a\nlittle vial.  \"Will you ask the servant for a glass of water and a\nteaspoon?\"\n\n\"Now,\" said I, when I had quickly prepared the mixture, \"she can have a\nteaspoonful of this, and another in ten minutes, and then we will see\nwhether we will go on with it or not.\"\n\n\"And what am I to look for?\" said he.\n\n\"In the first place,\" said I, producing a clinical thermometer, \"you\nmust take her temperature.  You know how to do that?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said he.  \"I have done it hundreds of times.  She must hold\nit in her mouth five minutes.\"\n\n\"Yes, and while you are waiting,\" I continued, \"you must try to find\nout, in the first place, if there are, or have been, any signs of\ndelirium.  You might ask the old lady, and besides, you may be able to\njudge for yourself.\"\n\n\"I can do that,\" said he.  \"I have seen lots of it.\"\n\n\"Then, again,\" said I, \"you must observe whether or not her pupils are\ndilated.  You might also inquire whether there had been any partial\nparalysis or numbness in any part of the body.  These things must be\nlooked for in brain trouble.  Then you can come down, ostensibly to\nprepare another prescription, and when you have reported, I have no\ndoubt I can give you something which will modify, or I should say--\"\n\n\"Hold her where she is till mornin',\" said Uncle Beamish. \"That's what\nyou mean.  Be quick.  Give me that thermometer and the tumbler, and\nwhen I come down again, I reckon you can fit her out with a\nprescription just as good as anybody.\"\n\nHe hurried away, and I sat down to consider.  I was full of ambition,\nfull of enthusiasm for the practice of my profession.  I would have\nbeen willing to pay largely for the privilege of undertaking an\nimportant case by myself, in which it would depend upon me whether or\nnot I should call in a consulting brother.  So far, in the cases I had\nundertaken, a consulting brother had always called himself in--that is,\nI had practised in hospitals or with my uncle.  Perhaps it might be\nfound necessary, notwithstanding all that had been said against me,\nthat I should go up to take charge of this case.  I wished I had not\nforgotten to ask the old man how he had found the tongue and pulse.\n\nIn less than a quarter of an hour Uncle Beamish returned.\n\n\"Well,\" said I, quickly, \"what are the symptoms?\"\n\n\"I'll give them to you,\" said he, taking his seat.  \"I'm not in such a\nhurry now, because I told the old woman I would like to wait a little\nand see how that fust medicine acted.  The patient spoke to me this\ntime.  When I took the thermometer out of her mouth she says, `You are\ncomin' up ag'in, doctor?' speakin' low and quickish, as if she wanted\nnobody but me to hear.\"\n\n\"But how about the symptoms?\" said I, impatiently.\n\n\"Well,\" he answered, \"in the fust place her temperature is ninety-eight\nand a half, and that's about nat'ral, I take it.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"but you didn't tell me about her tongue and pulse.\"\n\n\"There wasn't nothin' remarkable about them,\" said he.\n\n\"All of which means,\" I remarked, \"that there is no fever.  But that is\nnot at all a necessary accompaniment of brain derangements.  How about\nthe dilatation of her pupils?\"\n\n\"There isn't none,\" said Uncle Beamish; \"they are ruther squinched up,\nif anything.  And as to delirium, I couldn't see no signs of it, and\nwhen I asked the old lady about the numbness, she said she didn't\nbelieve there had been any.\"\n\n\"No tendency to shiver, no disposition to stretch?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the old man, \"no chance for quinine.\"\n\n\"The trouble is,\" said I, standing before the stove and fixing my mind\nupon the case with earnest intensity, \"that there are so few symptoms\nin brain derangement.  If I could only get hold of something tangible--\"\n\n\"If I was you,\" interrupted Uncle Beamish, \"I wouldn't try to get hold\nof nothin'.  I would just give her somethin' to keep her where she is\ntill mornin'.  If you can do that, I'll guarantee that any good doctor\ncan take her up and go on with her to-morrow.\"\n\nWithout noticing the implication contained in these remarks, I\ncontinued my consideration of the case.\n\n\"If I could get a drop of her blood,\" said I.\n\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed Uncle Beamish, \"I'm not goin' to do anything of\nthat sort.  What in the name of common sense would you do with her\nblood?\"\n\n\"I would examine it microscopically,\" I said.  \"I might find out all I\nwant to know.\"\n\nUncle Beamish did not sympathize with this method of diagnosis.\n\n\"If you did find out there was the wrong kind of germs, you couldn't do\nanything with them to-night, and it would just worry you,\" said the old\nman.  \"I believe that nature will get along fust-rate without any help,\nat least till mornin'.  But you've got to give her some medicine--not\nso much for her good as for our good.  If she's not treated we're\nbounced.  Can't you give her somethin' that would do anybody good, no\nmatter what's the matter with 'em?  If it was the spring of the year I\nwould say sarsaparilla.  If you could mix her up somethin' and put into\nit some of them benevolent microbes the doctors talk about, it would be\na good deed to do to anybody.\"\n\n\"The benign bacilli,\" said I.  \"Unfortunately I haven't any of them\nwith me.\"\n\n\"And if you had,\" he remarked, \"I'd be in favor of givin' 'em to the\nold woman.  I take it they would do, her more good than anybody else.\nCome along now, doctor; it is about time for me to go up-stairs and see\nhow the other stuff acted--not on the patient, I don't mean, but on the\nold woman.  The fact is, you know, it's her we're dosin'.\"\n\n\"Not at all,\" said I, speaking a little severely.  \"I am trying to do\nmy very best for the patient, but I fear I cannot do it without seeing\nher.  Don't you think that if you told the old lady how absolutely\nnecessary--\"\n\n\"Don't say anything more about that!\" exclaimed Uncle Beamish.  \"I\nhoped I wouldn't have to mention it, but she told me ag'in that she\nwould never have one of those unfledged medical students, just out of\nthe egg-shell, experimentin' on any of her family, and from what she\nsaid about you in particular, I should say she considered you as a\nmedical chick without even down on you.\"\n\n\"What can she know of me?\"  I asked indignantly.\n\n\"Give it up,\" said he.  \"Can't guess it.  But that ain't the p'int.\nThe p'int is, what are you goin' to give her?  When I was young the\ndoctors used to say, When you are in doubt, give calomel--as if you\nwere playin' trumps.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nonsense,\" said I, my eyes earnestly fixed upon my open\nmedical case.\n\n\"I suppose a mustard-plaster on the back of her neck--\"\n\n\"Wouldn't do at all,\" I interrupted.  \"Wait a minute, now--yes--I know\nwhat I will do: I will give her sodium bromide--ten grains.\"\n\n\"`Which will hit if it's a deer and miss if it's a calf' as the hunter\nsaid?\" inquired Uncle Beamish.\n\n\"It will certainly not injure her,\" said I, \"and I am quite sure it\nwill be a positive advantage.  If there has been cerebral disturbance,\nwhich has subsided temporarily, it will assist her to tide over the\ninterim before its recurrence.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"give it to me, and I'll be off.  It's\ntime I showed up ag'in.\"\n\nHe did not stay up-stairs very long this time.\n\n\"No symptoms yit, but the patient looked at me as if she wanted to say\nsomethin'; but she didn't git no chance, for the old lady set herself\ndown as if she was planted in a garden-bed and intended to stay there.\nBut the patient took the medicine as mild as a lamb.\"\n\n\"That is very good,\" said I.  \"It may be that she appreciates the\nseriousness of her ewe better than we do.\"\n\n\"I should say she wants to git well,\" he replied.  \"She looks like that\nsort of a person to me.  The old woman said she thought we would have\nto stay awhile till the storm slackened, and I said, yes, indeed, and\nthere wasn't any chance of its slackenin' to-night; besides, I wanted\nto see the patient before bedtime.\"\n\nAt this moment the door opened and the servant-woman came in.\n\n\"She says you are to have supper, and it will be ready in about half an\nhour.  One of you had better go out and attend to your horse, for the\nman is not coming back to-night.\"\n\n\"I will go to the barn,\" said I, rising.  Uncle Beamish also rose and\nsaid he would go with me.\n\n\"I guess you can find some hay and oats,\" said the woman, as we were\nputting on our coats and overshoes in the kitchen, \"and here's a\nlantern.  We don't keep no horse now, but there's feed left.\"\n\nAs we pushed through the deep snow into the barn, Uncle Beamish said:\n\n\"I've been tryin' my best to think where we are without askin' any\nquestions, and I'm dead beat.  I don't remember no such house as this\non the road.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we got off the road,\" said I.\n\n\"That may be,\" said he, as we entered the barn.  \"It's a straight road\nfrom Warburton to the pike near my sister's house, but there's two\nother roads that branch off to the right and strike the pike further\noff to the east.  Perhaps we got on one of them in all that darkness\nand perplexin' whiteness, when it wasn't easy to see whether we were\nkeepin' a straight road or not.\"\n\nThe horse neighed as we approached with a light.\n\n\"I would not be at all surprised,\" said I, \"if this horse had once\nbelonged here and that was the reason why, as soon as he got a chance,\nhe turned and made straight for his old home.\"\n\n\"That isn't unlikely,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"and that's the reason we\ndid not pass Crocker's.  But here we are, wherever it is, and here\nwe've got to stay till mornin'.\"\n\nWe found hay and oats and a pump in the corner of the wagon-house, and\nhaving put the horse in the stall and made him as comfortable as\npossible with some old blankets, we returned to the house, bringing our\nvalises with us.\n\nOur supper was served in the sitting-room because there was a good fire\nthere, and the servant told us we would have to eat by ourselves, as\n\"she\" was not coming down.\n\n\"We'll excuse her,\" said Uncle Beamish, with an alacrity of expression\nthat might have caused suspicion.\n\nWe had a good supper, and were then shown a room on the first floor on\nthe other side of the hall, where the servant said we were to sleep.\n\nWe sat by the stove awhile, waiting for developments, but as Uncle\nBeamish's bedtime was rapidly approaching, he sent word to the\nsick-chamber that he was coming up for his final visit.\n\nThis time he stayed up-stairs but a few minutes.\n\n\"She's fast asleep,\" said he, \"and the old woman says she'll call me if\nI'm needed in the night, and you'll have to jump up sharp and overhaul\nthat medicine-case if that happens.\"\n\nThe next morning, and very early in the morning, I was awaked by Uncle\nBeamish, who stood at my side.\n\n\"Look here,\" said he, \"I've been outside.  It's stopped snowin' and\nit's clearin' off.  I've been to the barn and I've fed the horse, and I\ntell you what I'm in favor of doin'.  There's nobody up yit, and I\ndon't want to stay here and make no explanations to that old woman.  I\ndon't fancy gittin' into rows on Christmas mornin'.  We've done all the\ngood we can here, and the best thing we can do now is to git away\nbefore anybody is up, and leave a note sayin' that we've got to go on\nwithout losin' time, and that we will send another doctor as soon as\npossible.  My sister's doctor don't live fur away from her, and I know\nshe will be willin' to send for him.  Then our duty will be done, and\nwhat the old woman thinks of us won't make no, difference to nobody.\"\n\n\"That plan suits me,\" said I, rising.  \"I don't want to stay here, and\nas I am not to be allowed to see the patient, there is no reason why I\nshould stay.  What we have done will more than pay for our supper and\nlodgings, so that our consciences are clear.\"\n\n\"But you must write a note,\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"Got any paper?\"\n\nI tore a leaf from my note-book, and went to the window, where it was\nbarely light enough for me to see how to write.\n\n\"Make it short,\" said the old man.  \"I'm awful fidgety to git off.\"\n\nI made it very short, and then, valises in hand, we quietly took our\nway to the kitchen.\n\n\"How this floor does creak!\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"Git on your overcoat\nand shoes as quick as you can, and we'll leave the note on this table.\"\n\nI had just shaken myself into my overcoat when Uncle Beamish gave a\nsubdued exclamation, and quickly turning, I saw entering the kitchen a\nfemale figure in winter wraps and carrying a hand-bag.\n\n\"By George!\" whispered the old man, \"it's the patient!\"\n\nThe figure advanced directly toward me.\n\n\"Oh, Dr. Glover!\" she whispered, \"I am so glad to get down before you\nwent away!\"\n\nI stared in amazement at the speaker, but even in the dim light I\nrecognized her.  This was the human being whose expected presence at\nthe Collingwood mansion was taking me there to spend Christmas.\n\n\"Kitty!\" I exclaimed--\"Miss Burroughs, I mean,--what is the meaning of\nthis?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me for any meanings now,\" she said.  \"I want you and your\nuncle to take me to the Collingwoods'.  I suppose you are on your way\nthere, for they wrote you were coming.  And oh!  let us be quick, for\nI'm afraid Jane will come down, and she will be sure to wake up aunty.\nI saw one of you go out to the barn, and knew you intended to leave, so\nI got ready just as fast as I could.  But I must leave some word for\naunty.\"\n\n\"I have written a note,\"  said I. \"But are you well enough to travel?\"\n\n\"Just let me add a line to it,\" said she.  \"I am as well as I ever was.\"\n\nI gave her a pencil, and she hurriedly wrote something on the paper\nwhich I had left on the kitchen table.  Then, quickly glancing around,\nshe picked up a large carving-fork, and sticking it through the paper\ninto the soft wood of the table, she left it standing there.\n\n\"Now it won't blow away when we open the door,\" she whispered.  \"Come\non.\"\n\n\"You cannot go out to the barn,\" I said; \"we will bring up the sleigh.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no, no,\" she answered, \"I must not wait here.  If I once get\nout of the house I shall feel safe.  Of course I shall go anyway, but I\ndon't want any quarrelling on this Christmas morning.\"\n\n\"I'm with you there,\" said Uncle Beamish, approvingly.  \"Doctor, we can\ntake her to the barn without her touching the snow.  Let her sit in\nthis arm-chair, and we can carry her between us.  She's no weight.\"\n\nIn half a minute the kitchen door was softly closed behind us, and we\nwere carrying Miss Burroughs to the barn.  My soul was in a wild\ntumult.  Dozens of questions were on my tongue, but I had no chance to\nask any of them.\n\nUncle Beamish and I returned to the porch for the valises, and then,\nclosing the back door, we rapidly began to make preparations for\nleaving.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Uncle Beamish, as we went into the stable, leaving\nMiss Burroughs in the wagon-house, \"that this business is all right?\nYou seem to know the young woman, and she is of age to act for herself.\"\n\n \"Whatever she wants to do,\" I answered, \"is perfectly right.\nYou may trust to that.  I do not understand the matter any more than\nyou do, but I know she is expected at the Collingwoods', and wants to\ngo there.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"We'll git away fust and ask\nexplanations afterwards.\"\n\n\"Dr. Glover,\" said Miss Burroughs, as we led the horse into the\nwagon-house, \"don't put the bells on him.  Stuff them gently under the\nseat--as softly as you can.  But how are we all to go away?  I have\nbeen looking at that sleigh, and it is intended only for two.\"\n\n\"It's rather late to think of that, miss,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"but\nthere's one thing that's certain.  We're both very polite to ladies,\nbut neither of us is willin' to be left behind on this trip.  But it's\na good-sized sleigh, and we'll all pack in, well enough.  You and me\ncan sit on the seat, and the doctor can stand up in front of us and\ndrive.  In old times it was considered the right thing for the driver\nof the sleigh to stand up and do his drivin'.\"\n\nThe baggage was carefully stowed away, and, after a look around the\ndimly lighted wagon-house, Miss Burroughs and Uncle Beamish got into\nthe sleigh, and I tucked the big fur robe around them.\n\n\"I hate to make a journey before breakfast,\" said Uncle Beamish, as I\nwas doing this, \"especially on Christmas mornin', but somehow or other\nthere seems to be somethin' jolly about this business, and we won't\nhave to wait so long for breakfast, nuther.  It can't be far from my\nsister's, and we'll all stop there and have breakfast.  Then you two\ncan leave me and go on.  She'll be as glad to see any friends of mine\nas if they were her own.  And she'll be pretty sure, on a mornin' like\nthis, to have buckwheat cakes and sausages.\"\n\nMiss Burroughs looked at the old man with a puzzled air, but she asked\nhim no questions.\n\n\"How are you going to keep yourself warm, Dr. Glover?\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, this long ulster will be enough for me,\" I replied, \"and as I\nshall stand up, I could not use a robe, if we had another.\"\n\nIn fact, the thought of being with Miss Burroughs and the anticipation\nof a sleigh-ride alone with her after we had left Uncle Beamish with\nhis sister, had put me into such a glow that I scarcely knew it was\ncold weather.\n\n\"You'd better be keerful, doctor,\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"You don't want\nto git rheumatism in your j'ints on this Christmas mornin'.  Here's\nthis horse-blanket that we are settin' on.  We don't need it, and you'd\nbetter wrap it round you, after you git in, to keep your legs warm.\"\n\n\"Oh, do!\" said Miss Burroughs.  \"It may look funny, but we will not\nmeet anybody so early as this.\"\n\n\"All right!\" said I, \"and now we are ready to start.\"\n\nI slid back the barn door and then led the horse outside.  Closing the\ndoor, and making as little noise as possible in doing it, I got into\nthe sleigh, finding plenty of room to stand up in front of my\ncompanions.  Now I wrapped the horse-blanket about the lower part of my\nbody, and as I had no belt with which to secure it, Miss Burroughs\nkindly offered to fasten it round my waist by means of a long pin which\nshe took from her hat.  It is impossible to describe the exhilaration\nthat pervaded me as she performed this kindly office.  After thanking\nher warmly, I took the reins and we started.\n\n\"It is so lucky,\" whispered Miss Burroughs, \"that I happened to think\nabout the bells.  We don't make any noise at all.\"\n\nThis was true.  The slowly uplifted hoofs of the horse descended\nquietly into the soft snow, and the sleigh-runners slipped along\nwithout a sound.\n\n\"Drive straight for the gate, doctor,\" whispered Uncle Beamish.  \"It\ndon't matter nothin' about goin' over flower-beds and grass-plats in\nsuch weather.\"\n\nI followed his advice, for no roadway could be seen.  But we had gone\nbut a short distance when the horse suddenly stopped.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Miss Burroughs, in a low voice.  \"Is it too\ndeep for him?\"\n\n\"We're in a drift,\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"But it's not too deep.  Make\nhim go ahead, doctor.\"\n\nI clicked gently and tapped the horse with the whip, but he did not\nmove.\n\n\"What a dreadful thing,\" whispered Miss Burroughs, leaning forward,\n\"for him to stop so near the house!  Dr. Glover, what does this mean?\"\nAnd, as she spoke, she half rose behind me.  \"Where did Sir Rohan come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"Who's he?\" asked Uncle Beamish, quickly.\n\n\"That horse,\" she answered.  \"That's my aunt's horse.  She sold him a\nfew days ago.\"\n\n\"By George!\" ejaculated Uncle Beamish, unconsciously raising his voice\na little.  \"Wilson bought him, and his bringin' us here is as plain as\nA B C.  And now he don't want to leave home.\"\n\n\"But he has got to do it,\" said I, jerking the horse's head to one side\nand giving him a cut with the whip.\n\n\"Don't whip him,\" whispered Miss Burroughs; \"it always makes him more\nstubborn.  How glad I am I thought of the bells!  The only way to get\nhim to go is to mollify him.\"\n\n\"But how is that to be done?\" I asked anxiously.\n\n\"You must give him sugar and pat his neck.  If I had some sugar and\ncould get out--\"\n\n\"But you haven't it, and you can't git out,\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"Try\nhim again doctor!\"\n\nI jerked the reins impatiently.  \"Go along!\" said I.  But he did not go\nalong.\n\n\"Haven't you got somethin' in your medicine-case you could mollify him\nwith?\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"Somethin' sweet that he might like?\"\n\nFor an instant I caught at this absurd suggestion, and my mind ran over\nthe contents of my little bottles.  If I had known his character, some\nsodium bromide in his morning feed might, by this time, have mollified\nhis obstinacy.\n\n\"If I could be free of this blanket,\" said I, fumbling at the pin\nbehind me, \"I would get out and lead him into the road.\"\n\n\"You could not do it,\" said Miss Burroughs.  \"You might pull his head\noff, but he wouldn't move.  I have seen him tried.\"\n\nAt this moment a window-sash in the second story of the house was\nraised, and there, not thirty feet from us, stood an elderly female,\nwrapped in a gray shawl, with piercing eyes shining through great\nspectacles.\n\n\"You seem to be stuck,\" said she, sarcastically.  \"You are worse stuck\nthan the fork was in my kitchen table.\"\n\nWe made no answer.  I do not know how Miss Burroughs looked or felt, or\nwhat was the appearance of Uncle Beamish, but I know I must have been\nvery red in the face.  I gave the horse a powerful crack and shouted to\nhim to go on.  There was no need for low speaking now.\n\n\"You needn't be cruel to dumb animals,\" said the old lady, \"and you\ncan't budge him.  He never did like snow, especially in going away from\nhome.  You cut a powerful queer figure, young man, with that\nhorse-blanket around you.  You don't look much like a practising\nphysician.\"\n\n\"Miss Burroughs,\" I exclaimed, \"please take that pin out of this\nblanket.  If I can get at his head I know I can pull him around and\nmake him go.\"\n\nBut she did not seem to hear me.  \"Aunty,\" she cried, \"it's a shame to\nstand there and make fun of us.  We have got a perfect right to go away\nif we want to, and we ought not to be laughed at.\"\n\nThe old lady paid no attention to this remark.\n\n\"And there's that false doctor,\" she said.  \"I wonder how he feels just\nnow.\"\n\n\"False doctor!\" exclaimed Miss Burroughs.  \"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"Young lady,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"I'm no false doctor.  I intended to\ntell you all about it as soon as I got a chance, but I haven't had one.\nAnd, old lady, I'd like you to know that I don't say I'm a doctor, but\nI do say I'm a nuss, and a good nuss, and you can't deny it.\"\n\nTo this challenge the figure at the window made no answer.\n\n\"Catherine,\" said she, \"I can't stand here and take cold, but I just\nwant to know one thing:  Have you positively made up your mind to marry\nthat young doctor in the horse-blanket?\"\n\nThis question fell like a bomb-shell into the middle of the stationary\nsleigh.\n\nI had never asked Kitty to marry me.  I loved her with all my heart and\nsoul, and I hoped, almost believed, that she loved me.  It had been my\nintention, when we should be left together in the sleigh this morning,\nafter dropping Uncle Beamish at his sister's house, to ask her to marry\nme.\n\nThe old woman's question pierced me as if it had been a flash of\nlightning coming through the frosty air of a winter morning.  I dropped\nthe useless reins and turned.  Kitty's face was ablaze.  She made a\nmovement as if she was about to jump out of the sleigh and flee.\n\n\"Oh, Kitty!\" said I, bending down toward her, \"tell her yes!  I beg I\nentreat, I implore you to tell her yes!  Oh, Kitty! if you don't say\nyes I shall never know another happy day.\"\n\nFor one moment Kitty looked up into my face, and then said she:\n\n\"It is my positive intention to marry him!\"\n\nWith the agility of a youth, Uncle Beamish threw the robe from him and\nsprang out into the deep snow.  Then, turning toward us, he took off\nhis hat.\n\n\"By George!\" said he, \"you're a pair of trumps.  I never did see any\nhuman bein's step up to the mark more prompt.  Madam,\" he cried,\naddressing the old lady, \"you ought to be the proudest woman in this\ncounty at seein' such a thing as this happen under your window of a\nChristmas mornin'.  And now the best thing that you can do is to invite\nus all in to have breakfast.\"\n\n\"You'll have to come in,\" said she, \"or else stay out there and freeze\nto death, for that horse isn't going to take you away.  And if my niece\nreally intends to marry the young man, and has gone so far as to start\nto run away with him,--and with a false doctor,--of course I've got no\nmore to say about it, and you can come in and have breakfast.\"  And\nwith that she shut down the window.\n\n\"That's talkin',\" said Uncle Beamish.  \"Sit still, doctor, and I'll\nlead him around to the back door.  I guess he'll move quick enough when\nyou want him to turn back.\"\n\nWithout the slightest objection Sir Rohan permitted himself to be\nturned back and led up to the kitchen porch.\n\n\"Now you two sparklin' angels get out,\" said Uncle Beamish, \"and go in.\nI'll attend to the horse.\"\n\nJane, with a broad grin on her face, opened the kitchen door.\n\n\"Merry Christmas to you both!\" said she.\n\n\"Merry Christmas!\" we cried, and each of us shook her by the hand.\n\n\"Go in the sitting-room and get warm,\" said Jane.  \"She'll be down\npretty soon.\"\n\nI do not know how long we were together in that sitting-room.  We had\nthousands of things to say, and we said most of them.  Among other\nthings, we managed to get in some explanations of the occurrences of\nthe previous night.  Kitty told her tale briefly.  She and her aunt, to\nwhom she was making a visit, and who wanted her to make her house her\nhome, had had a quarrel two days before.  Kitty was wild to go to the\nCollingwoods', and the old lady, who, for some reason, hated the\nfamily, was determined she should not go.  But Kitty was immovable, and\nnever gave up until she found that her aunt had gone so far as to\ndispose of her horse, thus making it impossible to travel in such\nweather, there being no public conveyances passing the house.  Kitty\nwas an orphan, and had a guardian who would have come to her aid, but\nshe could not write to him in time, and, in utter despair, she went to\nbed.  She would not eat or drink, she would not speak, and she covered\nup her head.\n\n\"After a day and a night,\" said Kitty, \"aunty got dreadfully frightened\nand thought something was the matter with my brain.  Her family are\nawfully anxious about their brains.  I knew she had sent for the doctor\nand I was glad of it, for I thought he would help me.  I must say I was\nsurprised when I first saw that Mr. Beamish, for I thought he was Dr.\nMorris.  Now tell me about your coming here.\"\n\n\"And so,\" she said, when I had finished, \"you had no idea that you were\nprescribing for me!  Please do tell me what were those medicines you\nsent up to me and which I took like a truly good girl.\"\n\n\"I didn't know it at the time,\" said I, \"but I sent you sixty drops of\nthe deepest, strongest love in a glass of water, and ten grains of\nperfect adoration.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Kitty, with a blush, and at that moment Uncle Beamish\nknocked at the door.\n\n\"I thought I'd just step in and tell you,\" said he, \"that breakfast\nwill be comin' along in a minute.  I found they were goin' to have\nbuckwheat cakes, anyway, and I prevailed on Jane to put sausages in the\nbill of fare.  Merry Christmas to you both!  I would like to say more,\nbut here comes the old lady and Jane.\"\n\nThe breakfast was a strange meal, but a very happy one.  The old lady\nwas very dignified.  She made no allusion to Christmas or to what had\nhappened, but talked to Uncle Beamish about people in Warburton.\n\nI have a practical mind, and, in spite of the present joy, I could not\nhelp feeling a little anxiety about what was to be done when breakfast\nwas over.  But just as we were about to rise from the table we were all\nstartled by a great jingle of sleigh-bells outside.  The old lady arose\nand stopped to the window.\n\n\"There!\" said she, turning toward us.  \"Here's a pretty kettle of fish!\nThere's a two-horse sleigh outside, with a man driving, and a gentleman\nin the back seat who I am sure is Dr. Morris, and he has come all the\nway on this bitter cold morning to see the patient I sent for him to\ncome to.  Now, who is going to tell him he has come on a fool's errand?\"\n\n\"Fool's errand!\" I cried.  \"Every one of you wait in here and I'll go\nout and tell him.\"\n\nWhen I dashed out of doors and stood by the side of my uncle's sleigh,\nhe was truly an amazed man.\n\n\"I will get in, uncle,\" said I, \"and if you will let John drive the\nhorses slowly around the yard, I will tell you how I happen to be here.\"\n\nThe story was a much longer one than I expected it to be, and John must\nhave driven those horses backward and forward for half an hour.\n\n\"Well,\" said my uncle, at last, \"I never saw your Kitty, but I knew her\nfather and her mother, and I will go in and take a look at her.  If I\nlike her, I will take you all on to the Collingwoods', and drop Uncle\nBeamish at his sister's house.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, young doctor,\" said Uncle Beamish, at\nparting, \"you ought to buy that big roan horse.  He has been a regular\nguardian angel to us this Christmas.\"\n\n\"Oh, that would never do at all,\" cried Kitty.  \"His patients would all\ndie before he got there.\"\n\n\"That is, if they had anything the matter with them,\" added my uncle.\n\n\n\n\nA PIECE OF RED CALICO\n\nBefore beginning the relation of the following incidents, I wish to\nstate that I am a young married man, doing business in a large city, in\nthe suburbs of which I live.\n\nI was going into town the other morning, when my wife handed me a\nlittle piece of red calico, and asked me if I would have time, during\nthe day, to buy her two yards and a half of calico like it.  I assured\nher that it would be no trouble at all, and putting the piece of calico\nin my pocket, I took the train for the city.\n\nAt lunch-time I stopped in at a large dry-goods store to attend to my\nwife's commission.  I saw a well-dressed man walking the floor between\nthe counters, where long lines of girls were waiting on much longer\nlines of customers, and asked him where I could see some red calico.\n\n\"This way, sir,\" and he led me up the store.  \"Miss Stone,\" said he to\na young lady, \"show this gentleman some red calico.\"\n\n\"What shade do you want!\" asked Miss Stone.\n\nI showed her the little piece of calico that my wife had given me.  She\nlooked at it and handed it back to me.  Then she took down a great roll\nof red calico and spread it out on the counter.\n\n\"Why, that isn't the shade!\" said I.\n\n\"No, not exactly,\" said she.  \"But it is prettier than your sample.\"\n\n\"That may be,\" said I.  \"But, you see, I want to match this piece.\nThere is something already in my house, made of this kind of calico,\nwhich needs to be made larger, or mended, or something.  I want some\ncalico of the same shade.\"\n\nThe girl made no answer, but took down another roll.\n\n\"That's the shade,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"but it's striped.\"\n\n\"Stripes are more worn than anything else in calicoes,\" said she.\n\n \"Yes.  But this isn't to be worn.  It's for furniture, I\nthink.  At any rate, I want perfectly plain stuff, to match something\nalready in use.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't think you can find it perfectly plain, unless you get\nTurkey red.\"\n\n\"What is Turkey red?\" I asked.\n\n\"Turkey red is perfectly plain in calicoes,\" she answered.\n\n\"Well, let me see some.\"\n\n\"We haven't any Turkey red calico left,\" she said, \"but we have some\nvery nice plain calicoes in other colors.\"\n\n\"I don't want any other color.  I want stuff to match this.\"\n\n\"It's hard to match cheap calico like that,\" she said, and so I left\nher.\n\nI next went into a store a few doors farther up Broadway.  When I\nentered I approached the \"floorwalker,\" and handing him my sample, said:\n\n\"Have you any calico like this?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said he.  \"Third counter to the right.\"  I went to the\nthird counter to the right, and showed my sample to the salesman in\nattendance there.  He looked at it on both sides.  Then he said:\n\n\"We haven't any of this.\"\n\n\"The floorwalker said you had,\" said I.\n\n\"We had it, but we're out of it now.  You'll get that goods at an\nupholsterers.\"\n\nI went across the street to an upholsterer's.\n\n\"Have you any stuff like this?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" said the salesman, \"we haven't.  Is it for furniture?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\n\n\"Then Turkey red is what you want.\"\n\n\"Is Turkey red just like this?\" I asked.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"but it's much better.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference to me,\" I replied.  \"I want something just\nlike this.\"\n\n\"But they don't use that for furniture,\" he said.\n\n\"I should think people could use anything they wanted for furniture,\" I\nremarked, somewhat sharply.\n\n\"They can, but they don't,\" he said quite calmly.  \"They don't use red\nlike that.  They use Turkey red.\"\n\nI said no more, but left.  The next place I visited was a very large\ndry-goods store.  Of the first salesman I saw I inquired if they kept\nred calico like my sample.\n\n\"You'll find that on the second story,\" said he.\n\nI went up-stairs.  There I asked a man:\n\n\"Where shall I find red calico?\"\n\n\"In the far room to the left,\" and he pointed to a distant corner.\n\nI walked through the crowds of purchasers and salespeople, around the\ncounters and tables filled with goods, to the far room to the left.\nWhen I got there I asked for red calico.\n\n\"The second counter down this side,\" said the man.  I went there and\nproduced my sample.  \"Calicoes down-stairs,\" said the man.\n\n\"They told me they were up here,\" I said.\n\n\"Not these plain goods.  You'll find them downstairs at the back of the\nstore, over on that side.\"\n\nI went down-stairs to the back of the store.\n\n\"Where can I find red calico like this?\" I asked.\n\n\"Next counter but one,\" said the man addressed, walking with me in the\ndirection pointed out.  \"Dunn, show red calicoes.\"\n\nMr. Dunn took my sample and looked at it.  \"We haven't this shade in\nthat quality of goods,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, have you it in any quality of goods?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes.  We've got it finer.\"  He took down a piece of calico, and\nunrolled a yard or two of it.\n\n\"That's not this shade,\" I said.\n\n\"No,\" said he.  \"The goods is finer and the color's better.\"\n\n\"I want it to match this,\" I said.\n\n\"I thought you weren't particular about the match,\" said the salesman.\n\"You said you didn't care for the quality of the goods, and you know\nyou can't match without you take into consideration quality and color\nboth.  If you want that quality of goods in red, you ought to get\nTurkey red.\"\n\nI did not think it necessary to answer this remark, but said:\n\n\"Then you've got nothing to match this?\"\n\n\"No, sir.  But perhaps they may have it in the upholstery department,\nin the sixth story.\"\n\nI got into the elevator and went up to the top of the house.\n\n\"Have you any red stuff like this?\" I said to a young man.\n\n\"Red stuff?  Upholstery department--other end of this floor.\"\n\nI went to the other end of the floor.\n\n\"I want some red calico,\" I said to a man.\n\n\"Furniture goods?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\n\"Fourth counter to the left.\"\n\nI went to the fourth counter to the left, and showed my sample to a\nsalesman.  He looked at it, and said:  \"You'll get this down on the\nfirst floor--calico department.\"\n\nI turned on my heel, descended in the elevator, and went out on\nBroadway.  I was thoroughly sick of red calico.  But I determined to\nmake one more trial.  My wife had bought her red calico not long\nbefore, and there must be some to be had somewhere.  I ought to have\nasked her where she bought it, but I thought a simple little thing like\nthat could be procured anywhere.\n\nI went into another large dry-goods store.  As I entered the door a\nsudden tremor seized me.  I could not bear to take out that piece of\nred calico.  If I had had any other kind of a rag about me--a pen-wiper\nor anything of the sort--I think I would have asked them if they could\nmatch that.\n\nBut I stepped up to a young woman and presented my sample, with the\nusual question.\n\n\"Back room, counter on the left,\" she said.\n\nI went there.\n\n\"Have you any red calico like this?\" I asked of the lady behind the\ncounter.\n\n\"No, sir,\" she said, \"but we have it in Turkey red.\"\n\nTurkey red again!  I surrendered.\n\n\"All right,\" I said.  \"Give me Turkey red.\"\n\n\"How much, sir?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't know--say five yards.\"\n\nThe lady looked at me rather strangely, but measured off five yards of\nTurkey red calico.  Then she rapped on the counter and called out,\n\"Cash!\"  A little girl, with yellow hair in two long plaits, came\nslowly up.  The lady wrote the number of yards; the name of the goods;\nher own number; the price; the amount of the bank-note I handed her;\nand some other matters--probably the color of my eyes and the direction\nand velocity of the wind--on a slip of paper.  She then copied all this\nin a little book which she kept by her.  Then she handed the slip of\npaper, the money, and the Turkey red to the yellow-haired girl.  This\nyoung girl copied the slip in a little book she carried, and then she\nwent away with the calico, the paper slip, and the money.\n\nAfter a very long time--during which the little girl probably took the\ngoods, the money, and the slip to some central desk, where the note was\nreceived, its amount and number entered in a book; change given to the\ngirl; a copy of the slip made and entered; girl's entry examined and\napproved; goods wrapped up; girl registered; plaits counted and entered\non a slip of paper and copied by the girl in her book; girl taken to a\nhydrant and washed; number of towel entered on a paper slip and copied\nby the girl in her book; value of my note and amount of change branded\nsomewhere on the child, and said process noted on a slip of paper and\ncopied in her book--the girl came to me, bringing my change and the\npackage of Turkey red calico.\n\nI had time for but very little work at the office that afternoon, and\nwhen I reached home I handed the package of calico to my wife.  She\nunrolled it and exclaimed:\n\n\"Why, this doesn't match the piece I gave you!\"\n\n\"Match it!\" I cried.  \"Oh no! it doesn't match it.  You didn't want\nthat matched.  You were mistaken.  What you wanted was Turkey\nred--third counter to the left.  I mean, Turkey red is what they use!\"\n\nMy wife looked at me in amazement, and then I detailed to her my\ntroubles.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"this Turkey red is a great deal prettier than what I\nhad, and you've bought so much of it that I needn't use the other at\nall.  I wish I had thought of Turkey red before.\"\n\n\"I wish from my heart you had!\" said I.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS WRECK\n\n\"Well, sir,\" said old Silas, as he gave a preliminary puff to the pipe\nhe had just lighted, and so satisfied himself that the draught was all\nright, \"the wind's a-comin', an' so's Christmas.  But it's no use bein'\nin a hurry fur either of 'em, fur sometimes they come afore you want\n'em, anyway.\"\n\nSilas was sitting in the stern of a small sailing-boat which he owned,\nand in which he sometimes took the Sandport visitors out for a sail,\nand at other times applied to its more legitimate but less profitable\nuse, that of fishing.  That afternoon he had taken young Mr. Nugent for\na brief excursion on that portion of the Atlantic Ocean which sends its\nbreakers up on the beach of Sandport.  But he had found it difficult,\nnay, impossible, just now, to bring him back, for the wind had\ngradually died away until there was not a breath of it left.  Mr.\nNugent, to whom nautical experiences were as new as the very nautical\nsuit of blue flannel which he wore, rather liked the calm.  It was such\na relief to the monotony of rolling waves.  He took out a cigar and\nlighted it, and then he remarked:\n\n\"I can easily imagine how a wind might come before you sailors might\nwant it, but I don't see how Christmas could come too soon.\"\n\n\"It come wunst on me when things couldn't `a' looked more onready fur\nit,\" said Silas.\n\n\"How was that?\" asked Mr. Nugent, settling himself a little more\ncomfortably on the hard thwart.  \"If it's a story, let's have it.  This\nis a good time to spin a yarn.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said old Silas.  \"I'll spin her.\"\n\nThe bare-legged boy whose duty it was to stay forward and mind the jib\ncame aft as soon as he smelt a story, and took a nautical position,\nwhich was duly studied by Mr. Nugent, on a bag of ballast in the bottom\nof the boat.\n\n\"It's nigh on to fifteen year ago,\" said Silas, \"that I was on the bark\nMary Auguster, bound for Sydney, New South Wales, with a cargo of\ncanned goods.  We was somewhere about longitood a hundred an' seventy,\nlatitood nothin', an' it was the twenty-second o' December, when we was\nketched by a reg'lar typhoon which blew straight along, end on, fur a\nday an' a half.  It blew away the storm-sails.  It blew away every\nyard, spar, shroud, an' every strand o' riggin', an' snapped the masts\noff close to the deck.  It blew away all the boats.  It blew away the\ncook's caboose, an' everythin' else on deck.  It blew off the hatches,\nan' sent 'em spinnin' in the air about a mile to leeward.  An' afore it\ngot through, it washed away the cap'n an' all the crew 'cept me an' two\nothers.  These was Tom Simmons, the second mate, an' Andy Boyle, a chap\nfrom the Adirondack Mount'ins, who'd never been to sea afore.  As he\nwas a landsman, he ought, by rights, to 'a' been swep' off by the wind\nan' water, consid'rin' that the cap'n an' sixteen good seamen had gone\na'ready.  But he had hands eleven inches long, an' that give him a grip\nwhich no typhoon could git the better of.  Andy had let out that his\nfather was a miller up there in York State, an' a story had got round\namong the crew that his granfather an' great-gran'father was millers,\ntoo; an' the way the fam'ly got such big hands come from their habit of\nscoopin' up a extry quart or two of meal or flour fur themselves when\nthey was levellin' off their customers' measures.  He was a\ngood-natered feller, though, an' never got riled when I'd tell him to\nclap his flour-scoops onter a halyard.\n\n\"We was all soaked, an' washed, an' beat, an' battered.  We held on\nsome way or other till the wind blowed itself out, an' then we got on\nour legs an' began to look about us to see how things stood.  The sea\nhad washed into the open hatches till the vessel was more'n half full\nof water, an' that had sunk her, so deep that she must 'a' looked like\na canal-boat loaded with gravel.  We hadn't had a thing to eat or drink\ndurin' that whole blow, an' we was pretty ravenous.  We found a keg of\nwater which was all right, and a box of biscuit which was what you\nmight call softtack, fur they was soaked through an' through with\nsea-water.  We eat a lot of them so, fur we couldn't wait, an' the rest\nwe spread on the deck to dry, fur the sun was now shinin' hot enough to\nbake bread.  We couldn't go below much, fur there was a pretty good\nswell on the sea, an' things was floatin' about so's to make it\ndangerous.  But we fished out a piece of canvas, which we rigged up\nag'in' the stump of the mainmast so that we could have somethin' that\nwe could sit down an' grumble under.  What struck us all the hardest\nwas that the bark was loaded with a whole cargo of jolly things to eat,\nwhich was just as good as ever they was, fur the water couldn't git\nthrough the tin cans in which they was all put up, an' here we was with\nnothin' to live on but them salted biscuit.  There wasn't no way of\ngittin' at any of the ship's stores, or any of the fancy prog, fur\neverythin' was stowed away tight under six or seven feet of water, an'\npretty nigh all the room that was left between decks was filled up with\nextry spars, lumber, boxes, an' other floatin' stuff.  All was\nshiftin', an' bumpin', an' bangin' every time the vessel rolled.\n\n\"As I said afore, Tom was second mate, an' I was bo's'n.  Says I to\nTom, `The thing we've got to do is to put up some kind of a spar with a\nrag on it fur a distress flag, so that we'll lose no time bein' took\noff.'  `There's no use a-slavin' at anythin' like that,' says Tom, `fur\nwe've been blowed off the track of traders, an' the more we work the\nhungrier we'll git, an' the sooner will them biscuit be gone.'\n\n\"Now when I heared Tom say this I sot still an' began to consider.\nBein' second mate, Tom was, by rights, in command of this craft.  But\nit was easy enough to see that if he commanded there'd never be nothin'\nfur Andy an' me to do.  All the grit he had in him he'd used up in\nholdin' on durin' that typhoon.  What he wanted to do now was to make\nhimself comfortable till the time come for him to go to Davy Jones's\nlocker--an' thinkin',  most likely, that Davy couldn't make it any\nhotter fur him than it was on that deck, still in latitood nothin' at\nall, fur we'd been blowed along the line pretty nigh due west.  So I\ncalls to Andy, who was busy turnin' over the biscuits on the deck.\n`Andy,' says I, when he had got under the canvas, `we's goin' to have a\n'lection fur skipper.  Tom, here, is about played out.  He's one\ncandydate, an' I'm another.  Now, who do you vote fur?  An' mind yer\neye, youngster, that you don't make no mistake.'  `I vote fur you' says\nAndy.  `Carried unanermous!' says I.  `An' I want you to take notice\nthat I'm cap'n of what's left of the Mary Auguster, an' you two has got\nto keep your minds on that, an' obey orders.'  If Davy Jones was to do\nall that Tom Simmons said when he heared this, the old chap would be\nkept busier than he ever was yit.  But I let him growl his growl out,\nknowin' he'd come round all right, fur there wasn't no help fur it,\nconsid'rin' Andy an' me was two to his one.  Pretty soon we all went to\nwork, an' got up a spar from below, which we rigged to the stump of the\nforemast, with Andy's shirt atop of it.\n\n\"Them sea-soaked, sun-dried biscuit was pretty mean prog, as you might\nthink, but we eat so many of 'em that afternoon, an' 'cordingly drank\nso much water, that I was obliged to put us all on short rations the\nnext day.  `This is the day afore Christmas,' says Andy Boyle, `an'\nto-night will be Christmas eve, an' it's pretty tough fur us to be\nsittin' here with not even so much hardtack as we want, an' all the\ntime thinkin' that the hold of this ship is packed full of the gayest\nkind of good things to eat.'  `Shut up about Christmas!' says Tom\nSimmons.  `Them two youngsters of mine, up in Bangor, is havin' their\ntoes and noses pretty nigh froze, I 'spect, but they'll hang up their\nstockin's all the same to-night, never thinkin' that their dad's bein'\ncooked alive on a empty stomach.'  `Of course they wouldn't hang 'em\nup,' says I, if they knowed what a fix you was in, but they don't know\nit, an' what's the use of grumblin' at 'em fur bein' a little jolly?'\n`Well,' says Andy `they couldn't be more jollier than I'd be if I could\ngit at some of them fancy fixin's down in the hold.  I worked well on\nto a week at 'Frisco puttin' in them boxes, an' the names of the things\nwas on the outside of most of 'em; an' I tell you what it is, mates, it\nmade my mouth water, even then, to read 'em, an' I wasn't hungry,\nnuther, havin' plenty to eat three times a day.  There was roast beef,\nan' roast mutton, an' duck, an' chicken, an' soup, an' peas, an' beans,\nan' termaters, an' plum-puddin', an' mince-pie--'  `Shut up with your\nmince-pie!' sung out Tom Simmons.  `Isn't it enough to have to gnaw on\nthese salt chips, without hearin' about mince-pie?'  `An' more'n that'\nsays Andy, `there was canned peaches, an' pears, an' plums, an'\ncherries.'\n\n\"Now these things did sound so cool an' good to me on that br'ilin'\ndeck that I couldn't stand it, an' I leans over to Andy, an' I says:\n`Now look-a here; if you don't shut up talkin' about them things what's\nstowed below, an' what we can't git at nohow, overboard you go!'  `That\nwould make you short-handed,' says Andy, with a grin.  `Which is more'n\nyou could say,' says I, `if you'd chuck Tom an' me over'--alludin' to\nhis eleven-inch grip.  Andy didn't say no more then, but after a while\nhe comes to me, as I was lookin' round to see if anything was in sight,\nan' says he, `I spose you ain't got nothin' to say ag'in' my divin'\ninto the hold just aft of the foremast, where there seems to be a bit\nof pretty clear water, an' see if I can't git up somethin'?' `You kin\ndo it, if you like,' says I, `but it's at your own risk.  You can't\ntake out no insurance at this office.'  `All right, then,' says Andy;\n`an' if I git stove in by floatin' boxes, you an' Tom'll have to eat\nthe rest of them salt crackers.'  `Now, boy,' says I,--an' he wasn't\nmuch more, bein' only nineteen year old,--`you'd better keep out o'\nthat hold.  You'll just git yourself smashed.  An' as to movin' any of\nthem there heavy boxes, which must be swelled up as tight as if they\nwas part of the ship, you might as well try to pull out one of the Mary\nAuguster's ribs.'  `I'll try it,' says Andy, `fur to-morrer is\nChristmas, an' if I kin help it I ain't goin' to be floatin' atop of a\nChristmas dinner without eatin' any on it.'  I let him go, fur he was a\ngood swimmer an' diver, an' I did hope he might root out somethin' or\nother, fur Christmas is about the worst day in the year fur men to be\nstarvin' on, an' that's what we was a-comin' to.\n\n\"Well, fur about two hours Andy swum, an' dove, an' come up blubberin',\nan' dodged all sorts of floatin' an' pitchin' stuff, fur the swell was\nstill on.  But he couldn't even be so much as sartin that he'd found\nthe canned vittles.  To dive down through hatchways, an' among broken\nbulkheads, to hunt fur any partiklar kind o' boxes under seven foot of\nsea-water, ain't no easy job.  An' though Andy said he got hold of the\nend of a box that felt to him like the big uns he'd noticed as havin'\nthe meat-pies in, he couldn't move it no more'n if it had been the\nstump of the foremast.  If we could have pumped the water out of the\nhold we could have got at any part of the cargo we wanted, but as it\nwas, we couldn't even reach the ship's stores, which, of course, must\nhave been mostly sp'iled anyway, whereas the canned vittles was just as\ngood as new.  The pumps was all smashed or stopped up, for we tried\n'em, but if they hadn't 'a' been we three couldn't never have pumped\nout that ship on three biscuit a day, an' only about two days' rations\nat that.\n\n\"So Andy he come up, so fagged out that it was as much as he could do\nto get his clothes on, though they wasn't much, an' then he stretched\nhimself out under the canvas an' went to sleep, an' it wasn't long\nafore he was talkin' about roast turkey an' cranberry sass, an'\npunkin-pie, an' sech stuff, most of which we knowed was under our feet\nthat present minnit.  Tom Simmons he just b'iled over, an' sung out:\n`Roll him out in the sun an' let him cook!  I can't stand no more of\nthis!'  But I wasn't goin' to have Andy treated no sech way as that,\nfur if it hadn't been fur Tom Simmons' wife an' young uns, Andy'd been\nworth two of him to anybody who was consid'rin' savin' life.  But I\ngive the boy a good punch in the ribs to stop his dreamin', fur I was\nas hungry as Tom was, an' couldn't stand no nonsense about Christmas\ndinners.\n\n\"It was a little arter noon when Andy woke up, an' he went outside to\nstretch himself.  In about a minute he give a yell that made Tom an' me\njump.  `A sail!' he hollered. `A sail!'  An' you may bet your life,\nyoung man, that 'twasn't more'n half a second afore us two had scuffled\nout from under that canvas, an' was standin' by Andy.  `There she is!'\nhe shouted, `not a mile to win'ard.'  I give one look, an' then I sings\nout:  `'Tain't a sail!  It's a flag of distress!  Can't you see, you\nland-lubber, that that's the Stars and Stripes upside down?'  `Why, so\nit is,' says Andy, with a couple of reefs in the joyfulness of his\nvoice. An' Tom he began to growl as if somebody had cheated him out of\nhalf a year's wages.\n\n\"The flag that we saw was on the hull of a steamer that had been\ndriftin' down on us while we was sittin' under our canvas.  It was\nplain to see she'd been caught in the typhoon, too, fur there wasn't a\nmast or a smoke-stack on her.  But her hull was high enough out of the\nwater to catch what wind there was, while we was so low sunk that we\ndidn't make no way at all.  There was people aboard, and they saw us,\nan' waved their hats an' arms, an' Andy an' me waved ours; but all we\ncould do was to wait till they drifted nearer, fur we hadn't no boats\nto go to 'em if we'd wanted to.\n\n\"`I'd like to know what good that old hulk is to us,' says Tom Simmons.\n`She can't take us off.'  It did look to me somethin' like the blind\nleadin' the blind.  But Andy he sings out:  `We'd be better off aboard\nof her, fur she ain't water-logged, an', more'n that, I don't s'pose\nher stores are all soaked up in salt water.'  There was some sense in\nthat, an' when the steamer had got to within half a mile of us, we was\nglad to see a boat put out from her with three men in it.  It was a\nqueer boat, very low an' flat, an' not like any ship's boat I ever see.\nBut the two fellers at the oars pulled stiddy, an' pretty soon the boat\nwas 'longside of us, an' the three men on our deck.  One of 'em was the\nfirst mate of the other wreck, an' when he found out what was the\nmatter with us, he spun his yarn, which was a longer one than ours.\nHis vessel was the Water Crescent, nine hundred tons, from 'Frisco to\nMelbourne, an' they had sailed about six weeks afore we did.  They was\nabout two weeks out when some of their machinery broke down, an' when\nthey got it patched up it broke ag'in, worse than afore, so that they\ncouldn't do nothin' with it.  They kep' along under sail for about a\nmonth, makin' mighty poor headway till the typhoon struck 'em, an' that\ncleaned their decks off about as slick as it did ours, but their\nhatches wasn't blowed off, an' they didn't ship no water wuth\nmentionin', an' the crew havin' kep' below, none of 'em was lost.  But\nnow they was clean out of provisions an' water, havin' been short when\nthe breakdown happened, fur they had sold all the stores they could\nspare to a French brig in distress that they overhauled when about a\nweek out.  When they sighted us they felt pretty sure they'd git some\nprovisions out of us.  But when I told the mate what a fix we was in\nhis jaw dropped till his face was as long as one of Andy's hands.\nHowsomdever, he said he'd send the boat back fur as many men as it\ncould bring over, an' see if they couldn't git up some of our stores.\nEven if they was soaked with salt water, they'd be better than nothin'.\nPart of the cargo of the Water Crescent was tools an' things fur some\nrailway contractors out in Australier, an' the mate told the men to\nbring over some of them irons that might be used to fish out the\nstores.  All their ship's boats had been blowed away, an' the one they\nhad was a kind of shore boat for fresh water, that had been shipped as\npart of the cargo, an' stowed below.  It couldn't stand no kind of a\nsea, but there wasn't nothin' but a swell on, an' when it come back it\nhad the cap'n in it, an' five men, besides a lot of chains an' tools.\n\n\"Them fellers an' us worked pretty nigh the rest of the day, an' we got\nout a couple of bar'ls of water, which was all right, havin' been tight\nbunged, an' a lot of sea-biscuit, all soaked an sloppy, but we only got\na half-bar'l of meat, though three or four of the men stripped an' dove\nfur more'n an hour.  We cut up some of the meat an' eat it raw, an' the\ncap'n sent some over to the other wreck, which had drifted past us to\nleeward, an' would have gone clean away from us if the cap'n hadn't had\na line got out an' made us fast to it while we was a-workin' at the\nstores.\n\n\"That night the cap'n took us three, as well as the provisions we'd got\nout, on board his hull, where the 'commodations was consid'able better\nthan they was on the half-sunk Mary Auguster.  An' afore we turned in\nhe took me aft an' had a talk with me as commandin' off'cer of my\nvessel.  `That wreck o' yourn,' says he, `has got a vallyble cargo in\nit, which isn't sp'iled by bein' under water.  Now, if you could get\nthat cargo into port it would put a lot of money in your pocket, fur\nthe owners couldn't git out of payin' you fur takin' charge of it an'\nhavin' it brung in.  Now I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll lie by you,\nan' I've got carpenters aboard that'll put your pumps in order, an'\nI'll set my men to work to pump out your vessel.  An' then, when she's\nafloat all right, I'll go to work ag'in at my vessel--which I didn't\ns'pose there was any use o' doin', but whilst I was huntin' round\namongst our cargo to-day I found that some of the machinery we carried\nmight be worked up so's to take the place of what is broke in our\nengine.  We've got a forge aboard, an' I believe we can make these\npieces of machinery fit, an' git goin' ag'in.  Then I'll tow you into\nSydney, an' we'll divide the salvage money.  I won't git nothin' fur\nsavin' my vessel, coz that's my business, but you wasn't cap'n o'\nyourn, an' took charge of her a-purpose to save her, which is another\nthing.'\n\n\"I wasn't at all sure that I didn't take charge of the Mary Auguster to\nsave myself an' not the vessel, but I didn't mention that, an' asked\nthe cap'n how he expected to live all this time.\n\n\"`Oh, we kin git at your stores easy enough,' says he, when the water's\npumped out.'  `They'll be mostly sp'iled,' says I.  `That don't matter'\nsays he.  `Men'll eat anything when they can't git nothin' else.'  An'\nwith that he left me to think it over.\n\n\"I must say, young man, an' you kin b'lieve me if you know anything\nabout sech things, that the idee of a pile of money was mighty temptin'\nto a feller like me, who had a girl at home ready to marry him, and who\nwould like nothin' better'n to have a little house of his own, an' a\nlittle vessel of his own, an' give up the other side of the world\naltogether.  But while I was goin' over all this in my mind, an'\nwonderin' if the cap'n ever could git us into port, along comes Andy\nBoyle, an' sits down beside me.  `It drives me pretty nigh crazy,' says\nhe, `to think that to-morrer's Christmas, an' we've got to feed on that\nsloppy stuff we fished out of our stores, an' not much of it, nuther,\nwhile there's all that roast turkey an' plum-puddin' an' mince-pie\na-floatin' out there just afore our eyes, an' we can't have none of\nit.'  `You hadn't oughter think so much about eatin', Andy,' says\nI,`but if I was talkin' about them things I wouldn't leave out canned\npeaches.  By George!  On a hot Christmas like this is goin' to be, I'd\nbe the jolliest Jack on the ocean if I could git at that canned fruit.'\n`Well, there's a way,' says Andy, `that we might git some of 'em.  A\npart of the cargo of this ship is stuff far blastin' rocks--ca'tridges,\n'lectric bat'ries, an' that sort of thing; an' there's a man aboard\nwho's goin' out to take charge of 'em.  I've been talkin' to this\nbat'ry man, an' I've made up my mind it'll be easy enough to lower a\nlittle ca'tridge down among our cargo an' blow out a part of it.' `What\n'u'd be the good of it,' says I, `blowed into chips?'  `It might smash\nsome,' says he, `but others would be only loosened, an' they'd float up\nto the top, where we could git 'em, specially them as was packed with\npies, which must be pretty light.'  `Git out, Andy,' says I, `with all\nthat stuff!'  An' he got out.\n\n\"But the idees he'd put into my head didn't git out, an' as I laid on\nmy back on the deck, lookin' up at the stars, they sometimes seemed to\nput themselves into the shape of a little house, with a little woman\ncookin' at the kitchin fire, an' a little schooner layin' at anchor\njust off shore.  An' then ag'in they'd hump themselves up till they\nlooked like a lot of new tin cans with their tops off, an' all kinds of\ngood things to eat inside, specially canned peaches--the big white\nkind, soft an' cool, each one split in half, with a holler in the\nmiddle filled with juice.  By George, sir! the very thought of a tin\ncan like that made me beat my heels ag'in the deck.  I'd been mighty\nhungry, an' had eat a lot of salt pork, wet an' raw, an' now the very\nidee of it, even cooked, turned my stomach.  I looked up to the stars\nag'in, an' the little house an' the little schooner was clean gone, an'\nthe whole sky was filled with nothin' but bright new tin cans.\n\n\"In the mornin' Andy he come to me ag'in.  `Have you made up your\nmind,' says he, `about gittin' some of them good things fur Christmas\ndinner?'  `Confound you!' says I, `you talk as if all we had to do was\nto go an' git 'em.'  `An' that's what I b'lieve we kin do,' says he,\n`with the help of that bat'ry man.' `Yes,' says I, `an' blow a lot of\nthe cargo into flinders, an' damage the Mary Auguster so's she couldn't\nnever be took into port.'  An' then I told him what the cap'n had said\nto me, an' what I was goin' to do with the money.  `A little\nca'tridge,' says Andy, `would do all we want, an' wouldn't hurt the\nvessel, nuther.  Besides that, I don't b'lieve what this cap'n says\nabout tinkerin' up his engine.  'Tain't likely he'll ever git her\nrunnin' ag'in, nor pump out the Mary Auguster, nuther.  If I was you\nI'd a durned sight ruther have a Christmas dinner in hand than a house\nan' wife in the bush.'  `I ain't thinkin' o' marryin' a girl in\nAustralier,' says I.  An' Andy he grinned, an' said I wouldn't marry\nnobody if I had to live on sp'iled vittles till I got her.\n\n\"A little arter that I went to the cap'n an' I told him about Andy's\nidee, but he was down on it.  `It's your vessel, an' not mine,' says\nhe, `an' if you want to try to git a dinner out of her I'll not stand\nin your way.  But it's my 'pinion you'll just damage the ship, an' do\nnothin'.'  Howsomdever, I talked to the bat'ry man about it, an' he\nthought it could be done, an' not hurt the ship, nuther.  The men was\nall in favor of it, fur none of 'em had forgot it was Christmas day.\nBut Tom Simmons he was ag'in' it strong, fur he was thinkin' he'd git\nsome of the money if we got the Mary Auguster into port.  He was a\nselfish-minded man, was Tom, but it was his nater, an' I s'pose he\ncouldn't help it.\n\n\"Well, it wasn't long afore I began to feel pretty empty an' mean, an'\nif I'd wanted any of the prog we got out the day afore, I couldn't have\nfound much, fur the men had eat it up nearly all in the night.  An' so\nI just made up my mind without any more foolin', an' me an' Andy Boyle\nan' the bat'ry man, with some ca'tridges an' a coil of wire, got into\nthe little shore boat, an' pulled over to the Mary Auguster.  There we\nlowered a small ca'tridge down the main hatchway, an' let it rest down\namong the cargo.  Then we rowed back to the steamer, uncoilin' the wire\nas we went.  The bat'ry man clumb up on deck, an' fixed his wire to a\n'lectric machine, which he'd got all ready afore we started.  Andy an'\nme didn't git out of the boat.  We had too much sense fur that, with\nall them hungry fellers waitin' to jump in her.  But we just pushed a\nlittle off, an' sot waitin', with our mouths awaterin', fur him to\ntouch her off.  He seemed to be a long time about it, but at last he\ndid it, an' that instant there was a bang on board the Mary Auguster\nthat made my heart jump.  Andy an' me pulled fur her like mad, the\nothers a-hollerin' arter us, an' we was on deck in no time.  The deck\nwas all covered with the water that had been throwed up.  But I tell\nyou, sir, that we poked an' fished about, an' Andy stripped an' went\ndown an' swum all round, an' we couldn't find one floatin' box of\ncanned goods.  There was a lot of splinters, but where they come from\nwe didn't know.  By this time my dander was up, an' I just pitched\naround savage.  That little ca'tridge wasn't no good, an' I didn't\nintend to stand any more foolin'.  We just rowed back to the other\nwreck, an' I called to the ba'try man to come down, an' bring some\nbigger ca'tridges with him, fur if we was goin' to do anything we might\nas well do it right.  So he got down with a package of bigger ones, an'\njumped into the boat.  The cap'n he called out to us to be keerful, an'\nTom Simmons leaned over the rail an' swored; but I didn't pay no\n'tention to nuther of 'em, an' we pulled away.\n\n\"When I got aboard the Mary Auguster, I says to the bat'ry man:  `We\ndon't want no nonsense this time, an' I want you to put in enough\nca'tridges to heave up somethin' that'll do fur a Christmas dinner.  I\ndon't know how the cargo is stored, but you kin put one big ca'tridge\n'midship, another for'ard, an' another aft, an' one or nuther of 'em\noughter fetch up somethin'.'  Well, we got the three ca'tridges into\nplace.  They was a good deal bigger than the one we fust used, an' we\nj'ined 'em all to one wire, an' then we rowed back, carryin' the long\nwire with us.  When we reached the steamer, me an' Andy was a-goin' to\nstay in the boat as we did afore, but the cap'n sung out that he\nwouldn't allow the bat'ry to be touched off till we come aboard.\n`Ther's got to be fair play,' says he.  `It's your vittles, but it's my\nside that's doin' the work.  After we've blasted her this time you two\ncan go in the boat an' see what there is to git hold of, but two of my\nmen must go along.'  So me an' Andy had to go on deck, an' two big\nfellers was detailed to go with us in the little boat when the time\ncome, an' then the bat'ry man he teched her off.\n\n\"Well, sir, the pop that followed that tech was somethin' to remember.\nIt shuck the water, it shuck the air, an' it shuck the hull we was on.\nA reg'lar cloud of smoke an' flyin' bits of things rose up out of the\nMary Auguster; an' when that smoke cleared away, an' the water was all\nb'ilin' with the splash of various-sized hunks that come rainin' down\nfrom the sky, what was left of the Mary Auguster was sprinkled over the\nsea like a wooden carpet fur water-birds to walk on.\n\n\"Some of the men sung out one thing, an' some another, an' I could hear\nTom Simmons swear; but Andy an' me said never a word, but scuttled down\ninto the boat, follered close by the two men who was to go with us.\nThen we rowed like devils fur the lot of stuff that was bobbin' about\non the water, out where the Mary Auguster had been.  In we went among\nthe floatin' spars and ship's timbers, I keepin' the things off with an\noar, the two men rowin', an' Andy in the bow.\n\n\"Suddenly Andy give a yell, an' then he reached himself for'ard with\nsech a bounce that I thought he'd go overboard.  But up he come in a\nminnit, his two 'leven-inch hands gripped round a box.  He sot down in\nthe bottom of the boat with the box on his lap an' his eyes screwed on\nsome letters that was stamped on one end.  `Pidjin-pies!' he sings out.\n`'Tain't turkeys, nor 'tain't cranberries but, by the Lord Harry, it's\nChristmas pies all the same!'  After that Andy didn't do no more work,\nbut sot holdin' that box as if it had been his fust baby.  But we kep'\npushin' on to see what else there was.  It's my 'pinion that the\nbiggest part of that bark's cargo was blowed into mince-meat, an' the\nmost of the rest of it was so heavy that it sunk.  But it wasn't all\nbusted up, an' it didn't all sink.  There was a big piece of wreck with\na lot of boxes stove into the timbers, and some of these had in 'em\nbeef ready b'iled an' packed into cans, an' there was other kinds of\nmeat, an' dif'rent sorts of vegetables, an' one box of turtle soup.  I\nlooked at every one of 'em as we took 'em in, an' when we got the\nlittle boat pretty well loaded I wanted to still keep on searchin'; but\nthe men they said that shore boat 'u'd sink if we took in any more\ncargo, an' so we put back, I feelin' glummer'n I oughter felt, fur I\nhad begun to be afeared that canned fruit, sech as peaches, was heavy,\nan' li'ble to sink.\n\n\"As soon as we had got our boxes aboard, four fresh men put out in the\nboat, an' after a while they come back with another load.  An' I was\nmighty keerful to read the names on all the boxes.  Some was meat-pies,\nan' some was salmon, an' some was potted herrin's, an' some was\nlobsters.  But nary a thing could I see that ever had growed on a tree.\n\n\"Well, sir, there was three loads brought in altogether, an' the\nChristmas dinner we had on the for'ard deck of that steamer's hull was\nabout the jolliest one that was ever seen of a hot day aboard of a\nwreck in the Pacific Ocean.  The cap'n kept good order, an' when all\nwas ready the tops was jerked off the boxes, and each man grabbed a can\nan' opened it with his knife.  When he had cleaned it out, he tuk\nanother without doin' much questionin' as to the bill of fare.  Whether\nanybody got pidjin-pie 'cept Andy, I can't say, but the way we piled in\nDelmoniker prog would 'a' made people open their eyes as was eatin'\ntheir Christmas dinners on shore that day.  Some of the things would\n'a' been better cooked a little more, or het up, but we was too fearful\nhungry to wait fur that, an' they was tiptop as they was.\n\n\"The cap'n went out afterwards, an' towed in a couple of bar'ls of\nflour that was only part soaked through, an' he got some other plain\nprog that would do fur future use.  But none of us give our minds to\nstuff like this arter the glorious Christmas dinner that we'd quarried\nout of the Mary Auguster.  Every man that wasn't on duty went below and\nturned in fur a snooze--all 'cept me, an' I didn't feel just altogether\nsatisfied.  To be sure, I'd had an A1 dinner, an', though a little\nmixed, I'd never eat a jollier one on any Christmas that I kin look\nback at.  But, fur all that, there was a hanker inside o' me.  I hadn't\ngot all I'd laid out to git when we teched off the Mary Auguster.  The\nday was blazin' hot, an' a lot of the things I'd eat was pretty\npeppery.  `Now,' thinks I, `if there had been just one can o' peaches\nsech as I seen shinin' in the stars last night!'  An' just then, as I\nwas walkin' aft, all by myself, I seed lodged on the stump of the\nmizzenmast a box with one corner druv down among the splinters.  It was\nhalf split open, an' I could see the tin cans shinin' through the\ncrack.  I give one jump at it, an' wrenched the side off.  On the top\nof the first can I seed was a picture of a big white peach with green\nleaves.  That box had been blowed up so high that if it had come down\nanywhere 'cept among them splinters it would 'a' smashed itself to\nflinders, or killed somebody.  So fur as I know, it was the only thing\nthat fell nigh us, an' by George, sir, I got it!  When I had finished a\ncan of 'em I hunted up Andy, an' then we went aft an' eat some more.\n`Well,' says Andy, as we was a-eatin', `how d'ye feel now about blowin'\nup your wife, an' your house, an' that little schooner you was goin' to\nown?'\n\n\"`Andy,' says I, `this is the joyfulest Christmas I've had yit, an' if\nI was to live till twenty hundred I don't b'lieve I'd have no joyfuler,\nwith things comin' in so pat; so don't you throw no shadders.'\n\n\"`Shadders!' says Andy.  `That ain't me.  I leave that sort of thing\nfur Tom Simmons.'\n\n\"`Shadders is cool,' says I, `an' I kin go to sleep under all he\nthrows.'\n\n\"Well, sir,\" continued old Silas, putting his hand on the tiller and\nturning his face seaward, \"if Tom Simmons had kept command of that\nwreck, we all would 'a' laid there an' waited an' waited till some of\nus was starved, an' the others got nothin' fur it, fur the cap'n never\nmended his engine, an' it wasn't more'n a week afore we was took off,\nan' then it was by a sailin' vessel, which left the hull of the Water\nCrescent behind her, just as she would 'a' had to leave the Mary\nAuguster if that jolly old Christmas wreck had been there.\n\n\"An' now, sir,\" said Silas, \"d'ye see that stretch o' little ripples\nover yander, lookin' as if it was a lot o' herrin' turnin' over to dry\ntheir sides?  Do you know what that is?  That's the supper wind.  That\nmeans coffee, an' hot cakes, an' a bit of br'iled fish, an' pertaters,\nan' p'r'aps, if the old woman feels in a partiklar good humor, some\ncanned peaches--big white uns, cut in half, with a holler place in the\nmiddle filled with cool, sweet juice.\"\n\n\n\n\nMY WELL AND WHAT CAME OUT OF IT\n\nEarly in my married life I bought a small country estate which my wife\nand I looked upon as a paradise.  After enjoying its delight for a\nlittle more than a year our souls were saddened by the discovery that\nour Eden contained a serpent.  This was an insufficient water-supply.\n\nIt had been a rainy season when we first went there, and for a long\ntime our cisterns gave us full aqueous satisfaction, but early this\nyear a drought had set in, and we were obliged to be exceedingly\ncareful of our water.\n\nIt was quite natural that the scarcity of water for domestic purposes\nshould affect my wife much more than it did me, and perceiving the\ndiscontent which was growing in her mind, I determined to dig a well.\nThe very next day I began to look for a well-digger.  Such an\nindividual was not easy to find, for in the region in which I lived\nwells had become unfashionable; but I determined to persevere in my\nsearch, and in about a week I found a well-digger.\n\nHe was a man of somewhat rough exterior, but of an ingratiating turn of\nmind.  It was easy to see that it was his earnest desire to serve me.\n\n\"And now, then,\" said he, when we had had a little conversation about\nterms, \"the first thing to do is to find out where there is water.\nHave you a peach-tree on the place?\"  We walked to such a tree, and he\ncut therefrom a forked twig.\n\n\"I thought,\" said I, \"that divining-rods were always of hazel wood.\"\n\n\"A peach twig will do quite as well,\" said he, and I have since found\nthat he was right.  Divining-rods of peach will turn and find water\nquite as well as those of hazel or any other kind of wood.\n\nHe took an end of the twig in each hand, and, with the point projecting\nin front of him, he slowly walked along over the grass in my little\norchard.  Presently the point of the twig seemed to bend itself\ndownward toward the ground.\n\n\"There,\" said he, stopping, \"you will find water here.\"\n\n\"I do not want a well here,\" said I.  \"This is at the bottom of a hill,\nand my barn-yard is at the top.  Besides, it is too far from the house.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said he.  \"We will try somewhere else.\"\n\nHis rod turned at several other places, but I had objections to all of\nthem.  A sanitary engineer had once visited me, and he had given me a\ngreat deal of advice about drainage, and I knew what to avoid.\n\nWe crossed the ridge of the hill into the low ground on the other side.\nHere were no buildings, nothing which would interfere with the purity\nof a well.  My well-digger walked slowly over the ground with his\ndivining-rod.  Very soon he exclaimed:  \"Here is water!\"  And picking\nup a stick, he sharpened one end of it and drove it into the ground.\nThen he took a string from his pocket, and making a loop in one end, he\nput it over the stick.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am going to make a circle four feet in diameter,\" he said.  \"We have\nto dig the well as wide as that, you know.\"\n\n\"But I do not want a well here,\" said I.  \"It's too close to the wall.\nI could not build a house over it.  It would not do at all.\"\n\nHe stood up and looked at me.  \"Well, sir,\" said he, \"will you tell me\nwhere you would like to have a well?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"I would like to have it over there in the corner of the\nhedge.  It would be near enough to the house; it would have a warm\nexposure, which will be desirable in winter; and the little house which\nI intend to build over it would look better there than anywhere else.\"\n\nHe took his divining-rod and went to the spot I had indicated.  \"Is\nthis the place?\" he asked wishing to be sure he had understood me.\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied.\n\nHe put his twig in position, and in a few seconds it turned in the\ndirection of the ground.  Then he drove down a stick, marked out a\ncircle, and the next day he came with two men and a derrick, and began\nto dig my well.\n\nWhen they had gone down twenty-five feet they found water, and when\nthey had progressed a few feet deeper they began to be afraid of\ndrowning.  I thought they ought to go deeper, but the well-digger said\nthat they could not dig without first taking out the water, and that\nthe water came in as fast as they bailed it out, and he asked me to put\nit to myself and tell him how they could dig it deeper.  I put the\nquestion to myself, but could find no answer.  I also laid the matter\nbefore some specialists, and it was generally agreed that if water came\nin as fast as it was taken out, nothing more could be desired.  The\nwell was, therefore, pronounced deep enough.  It was lined with great\ntiles, nearly a yard in diameter, and my well-digger, after\ncongratulating me on finding water so easily, bade me good-by and\ndeparted with his men and his derrick.\n\nOn the other side of the wall which bounded my grounds, and near which\nmy well had been dug, there ran a country lane, leading nowhere in\nparticular, which seemed to be there for the purpose of allowing people\nto pass my house, who might otherwise be obliged to stop.\n\nAlong this lane my neighbors would pass, and often strangers drove by,\nand as my well could easily be seen over the low stone wall, its\nconstruction had excited a great deal of interest.  Some of the people\nwho drove by were summer folks from the city, and I am sure, from\nremarks I overheard, that it was thought a very queer thing to dig for\nwater.  Of course they must have known that people used to do this in\nthe olden times, even as far back as the time of Jacob and Rebecca, but\nthe expressions of some of their faces indicated that they remembered\nthat this was the nineteenth century.\n\nMy neighbors, however, were all rural people, and much more intelligent\nin regard to water-supplies.  One of them, Phineas Colwell by name,\ntook a more lively interest in my operations than did any one else.  He\nwas a man of about fifty years of age, who had been a soldier.  This\nfact was kept alive in the minds of his associates by his dress, a part\nof which was always military.  If he did not wear an old fatigue-jacket\nwith brass buttons, he wore his blue trousers, or, perhaps, a waistcoat\nthat belonged to his uniform, and if he wore none of these, his\nmilitary hat would appear upon his head.  I think he must also have\nbeen a sailor, judging from the little gold rings in his ears.  But\nwhen I first knew him he was a carpenter, who did mason-work whenever\nany of the neighbors had any jobs of the sort.  He also worked in\ngardens by the day, and had told me that he understood the care of\nhorses and was a very good driver.  He sometimes worked on farms,\nespecially at harvest-time, and I know he could paint, for he once\nshowed me a fence which he said he had painted.  I frequently saw him,\nbecause he always seemed to be either going to his work or coming from\nit.  In fact, he appeared to consider actual labor in the light of a\nbad habit which he wished to conceal, and which he was continually\nendeavoring to reform.\n\nPhineas walked along our lane at least once a day, and whenever he saw\nme he told me something about the well.  He did not approve of the\nplace I had selected for it.  If he had been digging a well he would\nhave put it in a very different place.  When I had talked with him for\nsome time and explained why I had chosen this spot, he would say that\nperhaps I was right, and begin to talk of something else.  But the next\ntime I saw him he would again assert that if he had been digging that\nwell he would not have put it there.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile from my house, at a turn of the lane, lived\nMrs. Betty Perch.  She was a widow with about twelve children.  A few\nof these were her own, and the others she had inherited from two\nsisters who had married and died, and whose husbands, having proved\ntheir disloyalty by marrying again, were not allowed by the indignant\nMrs. Perch to resume possession of their offspring.  The casual\nobserver might have supposed the number of these children to be very\ngreat,--fifteen or perhaps even twenty,--for if he happened to see a\ngroup of them on the door-step, he would see a lot more if he looked\ninto the little garden; and under some cedar-trees at the back of the\nhouse there were always some of them on fine days.  But perhaps they\nsought to increase their apparent number, and ran from one place to\nanother to be ready to meet observation, like the famous clown\nGrimaldi, who used to go through his performances at one London\ntheatre, and then dash off in his paint and motley to another, so that\nperambulating theatre-going men might imagine that there were two\ngreatest clowns in the world.\n\nWhen Mrs. Perch had time she sewed for the neighbors, and, whether she\nhad time or not, she was always ready to supply them with news.  From\nthe moment she heard I was going to dig a well she took a vital\ninterest in it.  Her own water-supply was unsatisfactory, as she\ndepended upon a little spring which sometimes dried up in summer, and\nshould my well turn out to be a good one, she knew I would not object\nto her sending the children for pails of water on occasions.\n\n\"It will be fun for them,\" she said, \"and if your water really is good\nit will often come in very well for me.  Mr. Colwell tells me,\" she\ncontinued, \"that you put your well in the wrong place.  He is a\npractical man and knows all about wells, and I do hope that for your\nsake he may be wrong.\"\n\nMy neighbors were generally pessimists.  Country people are\nproverbially prudent, and pessimism is prudence.  We feel safe when we\ndoubt the success of another, because if he should succeed we can say\nwe were glad we were mistaken, and so step from a position of good\njudgment to one of generous disposition without feeling that we have\nchanged our plane of merit.  But the optimist often gets himself into\nterrible scrapes, for if he is wrong he cannot say he is glad of it.\n\nBut, whatever else he may be, a pessimist is depressing, and it was,\ntherefore, a great pleasure to me to have a friend who was an\nout-and-out optimist.  In fact, he might be called a working optimist.\nHe lived about six miles from my house, and had a hobby, which was\nnatural phenomena.  He was always on the lookout for that sort of\nthing, and when he found it he would study its nature and effect.  He\nwas a man in the maturity of youth, and if the estate on which he lived\nhad not belonged to his mother, he would have spent much time and money\nin investigating its natural phenomena.  He often drove over to see me,\nand always told me how glad he would be if he had an opportunity of\ndigging a well.\n\n\"I have the wildest desire,\" he said, \"to know what is in the earth\nunder our place, and if it should so happen in the course of time that\nthe limits of earthly existence should be reached by--I mean if the\nestate should come into my hands--I would go down, down, down, until I\nhad found out all that could be discovered.  To own a plug of earth\nfour thousand miles long and only to know what is on the surface of the\nupper end of it is unmanly.  We might as well be grazing beasts.\"\n\nHe was sorry that I was digging only for water, because water is a very\ncommonplace thing, but he was quite sure I would get it, and when my\nwell was finished he was one of the first to congratulate me.\n\n\"But if I had been in your place,\" said he, \"with full right to do as I\npleased, I would not have let those men go away.  I would have set them\nto work in some place where there would be no danger of getting\nwater,--at least, for a long time,--and then you would have found out\nwhat are the deeper treasures of your land.\"\n\nHaving finished my well, I now set about getting the water into my\nresidence near by.  I built a house over the well and put in it a\nlittle engine, and by means of a system of pipes, like the arteries and\nveins of the human body, I proposed to distribute the water to the\nvarious desirable points in my house.\n\nThe engine was the heart, which should start the circulation, which\nshould keep it going, and which should send throbbing through every\npipe the water which, if it were not our life, was very necessary to it.\n\nWhen all was ready we started the engine, and in a very short time we\ndiscovered that something was wrong.  For fifteen or twenty minutes\nwater flowed into the tank at the top of the house, with a sound that\nwas grander in the ears of my wife and myself than the roar of Niagara,\nand then it stopped.  Investigation proved that the flow had stopped\nbecause there was no more water in the well.\n\nIt is needless to detail the examinations, investigations, and the\nmultitude of counsels and opinions with which our minds were filled for\nthe next few days.  It was plain to see that although this well was\nfully able to meet the demands of a hand-pump or of bailing buckets,\nthe water did not flow into it as fast as it could be pumped out by an\nengine.  Therefore, for the purposes of supplying the circulation of my\ndomestic water system, the well was declared a failure.\n\nMy non-success was much talked about in the neighborhood, and we\nreceived a great deal of sympathy and condolence.  Phineas Colwell was\nnot surprised at the outcome of the affair.  He had said that the well\nhad been put in the wrong place.  Mrs. Betty was not only surprised,\nbut disgusted.\n\n\"It is all very well for you,\" she said, \"who could afford to buy water\nif it was necessary, but it is very different with the widow and the\norphan.  If I had not supposed you were going to have a real well, I\nwould have had my spring cleaned out and deepened.  I could have had it\ndone in the early summer, but it is of no use now.  The spring has\ndried up.\"\n\nShe told a neighbor that she believed the digging of my well had dried\nup her spring, and that that was the way of this world, where the widow\nand the orphan were sure to come out at the little end.\n\nOf course I did not submit to defeat--at least, not without a struggle.\nI had a well, and if anything could be done to make that well supply me\nwith water, I was going to do it.  I consulted specialists, and, after\ncareful consideration of the matter, they agreed that it would be\nunadvisable for me to attempt to deepen my present well, as there was\nreason to suppose there was very little water in the place where I had\ndug it, and that the very best thing I could do would be to try a\ndriven well.  As I had already excavated about thirty feet, that was so\nmuch gain to me, and if I should have a six-inch pipe put into my\npresent well and then driven down and down until it came to a place\nwhere there was plenty of water, I would have all I wanted.\n\nHow far down the pipe would have to be driven, of course they did not\nknow, but they all agreed that if I drove deep enough I would get all\nthe water I wanted.  This was the only kind of a well, they said, which\none could sink as deep as he pleased without being interfered with by\nthe water at the bottom.  My wife and I then considered the matter, and\nultimately decided that it would be a waste of the money which we had\nalready spent upon the engine, the pipes, and the little house, and, as\nthere was nothing else to be done but to drive a well, we would have a\nwell driven.\n\nOf course we were both very sorry that the work must be begun again,\nbut I was especially dissatisfied, for the weather was getting cold,\nthere was already snow upon the ground, and I was told that work could\nnot be carried on in winter weather.  I lost no time, however, in\nmaking a contract with a well-driver, who assured me that as soon as\nthe working season should open, which probably would be very early in\nthe spring, he would come to my place and begin to drive my well.\n\nThe season did open, and so did the pea-blossoms, and the pods actually\nbegan to fill before I saw that well-driver again.  I had had a good\ndeal of correspondence with him in the meantime, urging him to prompt\naction, but he always had some good reason for delay.  (I found out\nafterwards that he was busy fulfilling a contract made before mine, in\nwhich he promised to drive a well as soon as the season should open.)\n\nAt last--it was early in the summer--he came with his derricks, a\nsteam-engine, a trip-hammer, and a lot of men.  They took off the roof\nof my house, removed the engine, and set to work.\n\nFor many a long day, and I am sorry to say for many a longer night,\nthat trip-hammer hammered and banged.  On the next day after the\nnight-work began, one of my neighbors came to me to know what they did\nthat for.  I told him they were anxious to get through.\n\n\"Get through what?\" said he.  \"The earth?  If they do that, and your\nsix-inch pipe comes out in a Chinaman's back yard, he will sue you for\ndamages.\"\n\nWhen the pipe had been driven through the soft stratum under the old\nwell, and began to reach firmer ground, the pounding and shaking of the\nearth became worse and worse.  My wife was obliged to leave home with\nour child.\n\n\"If he is to do without both water and sleep,\" said she, \"he cannot\nlong survive.\"  And I agreed with her.\n\nShe departed for a pleasant summer resort where her married sister with\nher child was staying, and from week to week I received very pleasant\nletters from her, telling me of the charms of the place, and dwelling\nparticularly upon the abundance of cool spring water with which the\nhouse was supplied.\n\nWhile this terrible pounding was going on I heard various reports of\nits effect upon my neighbors.  One of them, an agriculturist, with whom\nI had always been on the best of terms, came with a clouded brow.\n\n\"When I first felt those shakes,\" he said, \"I thought they were the\neffects of seismic disturbances, and I did not mind, but when I found\nit was your well I thought I ought to come over to speak about it.  I\ndo not object to the shaking of my barn, because my man tells me the\ncontinual jolting is thrashing out the oats and wheat, but I do not\nlike to have all my apples and pears shaken off my trees.  And then,\"\nsaid he, \"I have a late brood of chickens, and they cannot walk,\nbecause every time they try to make a step they are jolted into the air\nabout a foot.  And again, we have had to give up having soup.  We like\nsoup, but we do not care to have it spout up like a fountain whenever\nthat hammer comes down.\"\n\nI was grieved to trouble this friend, and I asked him what I should do.\n\"Do you want me to stop the work on the well?\" said I.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said he, heartily.  \"Go on with the work.  You must have\nwater, and we will try to stand the bumping.  I dare say it is good for\ndyspepsia, and the cows are getting used to having the grass jammed up\nagainst their noses.  Go ahead; we can stand it in the daytime, but if\nyou could stop the night-work we would be very glad.  Some people may\nthink it a well-spring of pleasure to be bounced out of bed, but I\ndon't.\"\n\nMrs. Perch came to me with a face like a squeezed lemon, and asked me\nif I could lend her five nails.\n\n\"What sort?\" said I.\n\n\"The kind you nail clapboards on with,\" said she.  \"There is one of\nthem been shook entirely off my house by your well.  I am in hopes that\nbefore the rest are all shook off I shall get in some money that is\nowing me and can afford to buy nails for myself.\"\n\nI stopped the night-work, but this was all I could do for these\nneighbors.\n\nMy optimist friend was delighted when he heard of my driven well.  He\nlived so far away that he and his mother were not disturbed by the\njarring of the ground.  Now he was sure that some of the internal\nsecrets of the earth would be laid bare, and he rode or drove over\nevery day to see what we were getting out of the well.  I know that he\nwas afraid we would soon get water, but was too kind-hearted to say so.\n\nOne day the pipe refused to go deeper.  No matter how hard it was\nstruck, it bounced up again.  When some of the substance it had struck\nwas brought up it looked like French chalk, and my optimist eagerly\nexamined it.\n\n\"A French-chalk mine,\" said he, \"would not be a bad thing, but I hoped\nthat you had struck a bed of mineral gutta-percha.  That would be a\ngrand find.\"\n\nBut the chalk-bed was at last passed, and we began again to bring up\nnothing but common earth.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said my optimist to me, one morning, \"that you must soon\ncome to water, and if you do I hope it will be hot water.\"\n\n\"Hot water!\" I exclaimed.  \"I do not want that.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, you would, if you had thought about it as much as I have,\" he\nreplied.  \"I lay awake for hours last night, thinking what would happen\nif you struck hot water.  In the first place, it would be absolutely\npure, because, even if it were possible for germs and bacilli to get\ndown so deep, they would be boiled before you got them, and then you\ncould cool that water for drinking.  When fresh it would be already\nheated for cooking and hot baths.  And then--just think of it!--you\ncould introduce the hot-water system of heating into your house, and\nthere would be the hot water always ready.  But the great thing would\nbe your garden.  Think of the refuse hot water circulating in pipes up\nand down and under all your beds!  That garden would bloom in the\nwinter as others do in the summer; at least, you could begin to have\nLima-beans and tomatoes as soon as the frost was out of the air.\"\n\nI laughed.  \"It would take a lot of pumping,\" I said, \"to do all that\nwith the hot water.\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot to say,\" he cried, with sparkling eyes, \"that I do not\nbelieve you would ever have any more pumping to do.  You have now gone\ndown so far that I am sure whatever you find will force itself up.  It\nwill spout high into the air or through all your pipes, and run always.\"\n\nPhineas Colwell was by when this was said, and he must have gone down\nto Mrs. Betty Perch's house to talk it over with her, for in the\nafternoon she came to see me.\n\n\"I understand,\" said she, \"that you are trying to get hot water out of\nyour well, and that there is likely to be a lot more than you need, so\nthat it will run down by the side of the road.  I just want to say that\nif a stream of hot water comes down past my house some of the children\nwill be bound to get into it and be scalded to death, and I came to say\nthat if that well is going to squirt b'iling water I'd like to have\nnotice so that I can move, though where a widow with so many orphans is\ngoing to move to nobody knows.  Mr. Colwell says that if you had got\nhim to tell you where to put that well there would have been no danger\nof this sort of thing.\"\n\nThe next day the optimist came to me, his face fairly blazing with a\nnew idea.  \"I rode over on purpose to urge you,\" he cried, \"if you\nshould strike hot water, not to stop there.  Go on, and, by George! you\nmay strike fire.\"\n\n\"Heavens!\" I cried.\n\n\"Oh, quite the opposite,\" said he.  \"But do not let us joke.  I think\nthat would be the grandest thing of this age.  Think of a fire well,\nwith the flames shooting up perhaps a hundred feet into the air!\"\n\nI wish Phineas Colwell had not been there.  As it was, he turned pale\nand sat down on the wall.\n\n\"You look astonished!\" exclaimed the optimist, \"but listen to me.  You\nhave not thought of this thing as I have.  If you should strike fire\nyour fortune would be made.  By a system of reflectors you could light\nup the whole country.  By means of tiles and pipes this region could be\nmade tropical.  You could warm all the houses in the neighborhood with\nhot air.  And then the power you could generate--just think of it!\nHeat is power; the cost of power is the fuel.  You could furnish power\nto all who wanted it.  You could fill this region with industries.  My\ndear sir, you must excuse my agitation, but if you should strike fire\nthere is no limit to the possibilities of achievement.\"\n\n\"But I want water,\" said I.  \"Fire would not take the place of that.\"\n\n\"Oh, water is a trifle,\" said he.  \"You could have pipes laid from\ntown; it is only about two miles.  But fire!  Nobody has yet gone down\ndeep enough for that.  You have your future in your hands.\"\n\nAs I did not care to connect my future with fire, this idea did not\nstrike me very forcibly, but it struck Phineas Colwell.  He did not say\nanything to me, but after I had gone he went to the well-drivers.\n\n\"If you feel them pipes getting hot,\" he said to them, \"I warn you to\nstop.  I have been in countries where there are volcanoes, and I know\nwhat they are.  There's enough of them in this world, and there's no\nneed of making new ones.\"\n\nIn the afternoon a wagoner, who happened to be passing, brought me a\nnote from Mrs. Perch, very badly spelled, asking if I would let one of\nmy men bring her a pail of water, for she could not think of coming\nherself or letting any of the children come near my place if spouting\nfires were expected.\n\nThe well-driving had gone on and on, with intermissions on account of\nsickness in the families of the various workmen, until it had reached\nthe limit which I had fixed, and we had not found water in sufficient\nquantity, hot or cold, nor had we struck fire, or anything else worth\nhaving.\n\nThe well-drivers and some specialists were of the opinion that if I\nwere to go ten, twenty, or perhaps a hundred feet deeper, I would be\nvery likely to get all the water I wanted.  But, of course, they could\nnot tell how deep they must go, for some wells were over a thousand\nfeet deep.  I shook my head at this.  There seemed to be only one thing\ncertain about this drilling business, and that was the expense.  I\ndeclined to go any deeper.\n\n\"I think,\" a facetious neighbor said to me, \"it would be cheaper for\nyou to buy a lot of Apollinaris water,--at wholesale rates, of\ncourse,--and let your men open so many bottles a day and empty them\ninto your tank.  You would find that would pay better in the long run.\"\n\nPhineas Colwell told me that when he had informed Mrs. Perch that I was\ngoing to stop operations, she was in a dreadful state of mind.  After\nall she had undergone, she said, it was simply cruel to think of my\nstopping before I got water, and that after having dried up her spring!\n\nThis is what Phineas said she said, but when next I met her she told me\nthat he had declared that if I had put the well where he thought it\nought to be, I should have been having all the water I wanted before\nnow.\n\nMy optimist was dreadfully cast down when he heard that I would drive\nno deeper.\n\n\"I have been afraid of this,\" he said.  \"I have, been afraid of it.\nAnd if circumstances had so arranged themselves that I should have\ncommand of money, I should have been glad to assume the expense of\ndeeper explorations.  I have been thinking a great deal about the\nmatter, and I feel quite sure that even if you did not get water or\nanything else that might prove of value to you, it would be a great\nadvantage to have a pipe sunk into the earth to the depth of, say, one\nthousand feet.\"\n\n\"What possible advantage could that be?\" I asked.\n\n\"I will tell you,\" he said.  \"You would then have one of the grandest\nopportunities ever offered to man of constructing a gravity-engine.\nThis would be an engine which would be of no expense at all to run.  It\nwould need no fuel.  Gravity would be the power.  It would work a pump\nsplendidly.  You could start it when you liked and stop it when you\nliked.\"\n\n\"Pump!\" said I.  \"What is the good of a pump without water?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course you would have to have water,\" he answered.  \"But, no\nmatter how you get it, you will have to pump it up to your tank so as\nto make it circulate over your house.  Now, my gravity-pump would do\nthis beautifully.  You see, the pump would be arranged with cog-wheels\nand all that sort of thing, and the power would be supplied by a\nweight, which would be a cylinder of lead or iron, fastened to a rope\nand run down inside your pipe.  Just think of it!  It would run down a\nthousand feet, and where is there anything worked by weight that has\nsuch a fall as that?\"\n\nI laughed.  \"That is all very well,\" said I.  \"But how about the power\nrequired to wind that weight up again when it got to the bottom?  I\nshould have to have an engine to do that.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said he.  \"I have planned the thing better than that.  You\nsee, the greater the weight the greater the power and the velocity.\nNow, if you take a solid cylinder of lead about four inches in\ndiameter, so that it would slip easily down your pipe,--you might\ngrease it, for that matter,--and twenty feet in length, it would be an\nenormous weight, and in slowly descending for about an hour a day--for\nthat would be long enough for your pumping--and going down a thousand\nfeet, it would run your engine for a year.  Now, then, at the end of\nthe year you could not expect to haul that weight up again.  You would\nhave a trigger arrangement which would detach it from the rope when it\ngot to the bottom.  Then you would wind up your rope,--a man could do\nthat in a short time,--and you would attach another cylinder of lead,\nand that would run your engine for another year, minus a few days,\nbecause it would only go down nine hundred and eighty feet.  The next\nyear you would put on another cylinder, and so on.  I have not worked\nout the figures exactly, but I think that in this way your engine would\nrun for thirty years before the pipe became entirely filled with\ncylinders.  That would be probably as long as you would care to have\nwater forced into the house.\"\n\n\"Yes\"' said I, \"I think that is likely.\"\n\nHe saw that his scheme did not strike me favorably.  Suddenly a light\nflashed across his face.\n\n\"I tell you what you can do with your pipe,\" he said, \"just as it is.\nYou can set up a clock over it which would run for forty years without\nwinding.\"\n\nI smiled, and he turned sadly away to his horse; but he had not ridden\nten yards before he came back and called to me over the wall.\n\n\"If the earth at the bottom of your pipe should ever yield to pressure\nand give way, and if water or gas, or--anything, should be squirted out\nof it, I beg you will let me know as soon as possible.\"\n\nI promised to do so.\n\nWhen the pounding was at an end my wife and child came home.  But the\nseason continued dry, and even their presence could not counteract the\nfeeling of aridity which seemed to permeate everything which belonged\nto us, material or immaterial.  We had a great deal of commiseration\nfrom our neighbors.  I think even Mrs. Betty Perch began to pity us a\nlittle, for her spring had begun to trickle again in a small way, and\nshe sent word to me that if we were really in need of water she would\nbe willing to divide with us.  Phineas Colwell was sorry for us, of\ncourse, but he could not help feeling and saying that if I had\nconsulted him the misfortune would have been prevented.\n\nIt was late in the summer when my wife returned, and when she made her\nfirst visit of inspection to the grounds and gardens, her eyes, of\ncourse, fell upon the unfinished well.  She was shocked.\n\n\"I never saw such a scene of wreckage,\" she said.  \"It looks like a\nWestern town after a cyclone.  I think the best thing you can do is to\nhave this dreadful litter cleared up, the ground smoothed and raked,\nthe wall mended, and the roof put back on that little house, and then\nif we can make anybody believe it is an ice-house, so much the better.\"\n\nThis was good advice, and I sent for a man to put the vicinity of the\nwell in order and give it the air of neatness which characterizes the\nrest of our home.\n\nThe man who came was named Mr. Barnet.  He was a contemplative fellow\nwith a pipe in his mouth.  After having worked at the place for half a\nday he sent for me and said:\n\n\"I'll tell you what I would do if I was in your place.  I'd put that\npump-house in order, and I'd set up the engine, and put the pump down\ninto that thirty-foot well you first dug, and I'd pump water into my\nhouse.\"\n\nI looked at him in amazement.\n\n\"There's lots of water in that well,\" he continued, \"and if there's\nthat much now in this drought, you will surely have ever so much more\nwhen the weather isn't so dry.  I have measured the water, and I know.\"\n\nI could not understand him.  It seemed to me that he was talking\nwildly.  He filled his pipe and lighted it and sat upon the wall.\n\n\"Now,\" said he, after he had taken a few puffs, \"I'll tell you where\nthe trouble's been with your well.  People are always in too big a\nhurry in this world about all sorts of things as well as wells.  I am a\nwell-digger and I know all about them.  We know if there is any water\nin the ground it will always find its way to the deepest hole there is,\nand we dig a well so as to give it a deep hole to go to in the place\nwhere we want it.  But you can't expect the water to come to that hole\njust the very day it's finished.  Of course you will get some, because\nit's right there in the neighborhood, but there is always a lot more\nthat will come if you give it time.  It's got to make little channels\nand passages for itself, and of course it takes time to do that.  It's\nlike settling up a new country.  Only a few pioneers come at first, and\nyou have to wait for the population to flow in.  This being a dry\nseason, and the water in the ground a little sluggish on that account,\nit was a good while finding out where your well was.  If I had happened\nalong when you was talking about a well, I think I should have said to\nyou that I knew a proverb which would about fit your case, and that is:\n`Let well enough alone.'\"\n\nI felt like taking this good man by the hand, but I did not.  I only\ntold him to go ahead and do everything that was proper.\n\nThe next morning, as I was going to the well, I saw Phineas Colwell\ncoming down the lane and Mrs. Betty Perch coming up it.  I did not wish\nthem to question me, so I stepped behind some bushes.  When they met\nthey stopped.\n\n\"Upon my word!\" exclaimed Mrs. Betty, \"if he isn't going to work again\non that everlasting well!  If he's got so much money he don't know what\nto do with it, I could tell him that there's people in this world, and\nnot far away either, who would be the better for some of it.  It's a\nsin and a shame and an abomination.  Do you believe, Mr. Colwell, that\nthere is the least chance in the world of his ever getting water enough\nout of that well to shave himself with?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Perch,\" said Phineas, \"it ain't no use talking about that well.\nIt ain't no use, and it never can be no use, because it's in the wrong\nplace.  If he ever pumps water out of that well into his house I'll\ndo--\"\n\n\"What will you do?\" asked Mr. Barnet, who just then appeared from the\nrecesses of the engine-house.\n\n\"I'll do anything on this earth that you choose to name,\" said Phineas.\n\"I am safe, whatever it is.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Mr. Barnet, knocking the ashes from his pipe\npreparatory to filling it again, \"will you marry Mrs. Perch?\"\n\nPhineas laughed.  \"Yes,\" he said.  \"I promised I would do anything, and\nI'll promise that.\"\n\n\"A slim chance for me,\" said Mrs. Betty, \"even if I'd have you.\"  And\nshe marched on with her nose in the air.\n\nWhen Mr. Barnet got fairly to work with his derrick, his men, and his\nbuckets, he found that there was a good deal more to do than he had\nexpected.  The well-drivers had injured the original well by breaking\nsome of the tiles which lined it, and these had to be taken out and\nothers put in, and in the course of this work other improvements\nsuggested themselves and were made.  Several times operations were\ndelayed by sickness in the family of Mr. Barnet, and also in the\nfamilies of his workmen, but still the work went on in a very fair\nmanner, although much more slowly than had been supposed by any one.\nBut in the course of time--I will not say how much time--the work was\nfinished, the engine was in its place, and it pumped water into my\nhouse, and every day since then it has pumped all the water we need,\npure, cold, and delicious.\n\nKnowing the promise Phineas Colwell had made, and feeling desirous of\nhaving everything which concerned my well settled and finished, I went\nto look for him to remind him of his duty toward Mrs. Perch, but I\ncould not find that naval and military mechanical agriculturist.  He\nhad gone away to take a job or a contract,--I could not discover\nwhich,--and he has not since appeared in our neighborhood.  Mrs. Perch\nis very severe on me about this.\n\n\"There's plenty of bad things come out of that well,\" she said, \"but I\nnever thought anything bad enough would come out of it to make Mr.\nColwell go away and leave me to keep on being a widow with all them\norphans.\"\n\n\n\n\nMR. TOLMAN\n\nMr. Tolman was a gentleman whose apparent age was of a varying\ncharacter.  At times, when deep in thought on business matters or other\naffairs, one might have thought him fifty-five or fifty-seven, or even\nsixty.  Ordinarily, however, when things were running along in a\nsatisfactory and commonplace way, he appeared to be about fifty years\nold, while upon some extraordinary occasions, when the world assumed an\nunusually attractive aspect, his age seemed to run down to forty-five\nor less.\n\nHe was the head of a business firm.  In fact, he was the only member of\nit.  The firm was known as Pusey and Co.  But Pusey had long been dead\nand the \"Co.,\" of which Mr. Tolman had been a member, was dissolved.\nOur elderly hero, having bought out the business, firm-name and all,\nfor many years had carried it on with success and profit.  His\ncounting-house was a small and quiet place, but a great deal of money\nhad been made in it.  Mr. Tolman was rich--very rich indeed.\n\nAnd yet, as he sat in his counting-room one winter evening, he looked\nhis oldest.  He had on his hat and his overcoat, his gloves and his fur\ncollar.  Every one else in the establishment had gone home, and he,\nwith the keys in his hand, was ready to lock up and leave also.  He\noften stayed later than any one else, and left the keys with Mr.\nCanterfield, the head clerk, as he passed his house on his way home.\n\nMr. Tolman seemed in no hurry to go.  He simply sat and thought, and\nincreased his apparent age.  The truth was, he did not want to go home.\nHe was tired of going home.  This was not because his home was not a\npleasant one.  No single gentleman in the city had a handsomer or more\ncomfortable suite of rooms.  It was not because he felt lonely, or\nregretted that a wife and children did not brighten and enliven his\nhome.  He was perfectly satisfied to be a bachelor.  The conditions\nsuited him exactly.  But, in spite of all this, he was tired of going\nhome.\n\n\"I wish,\" said Mr. Tolman to himself, \"that I could feel some interest\nin going home.\"  Then he rose and took a turn or two up and down the\nroom.  But as that did not seem to give him any more interest in the\nmatter, he sat down again.  \"I wish it were necessary for me to go\nhome,\" said he, \"but it isn't.\"  So then he fell again to thinking.\n\"What I need,\" he said, after a while, \"is to depend more upon\nmyself--to feel that I am necessary to myself.  Just now I'm not.  I'll\nstop going home--at least, in this way.  Where's the sense in envying\nother men, when I can have all that they have just as well as not?  And\nI'll have it, too,\" said Mr. Tolman, as he went out and locked the\ndoors.  Once in the streets, and walking rapidly, his ideas shaped\nthemselves easily and readily into a plan which, by the time he reached\nthe house of his head clerk, was quite matured.  Mr. Canterfield was\njust going down to dinner as his employer rang the bell, so he opened\nthe door himself.  \"I will detain you but a minute or two,\" said Mr.\nTolman, handing the keys to Mr. Canterfield.  \"Shall we step into the\nparlor?\"\n\nWhen his employer had gone, and Mr. Canterfield had joined his family\nat the dinner-table, his wife immediately asked him what Mr. Tolman\nwanted.\n\n\"Only to say that he is going away to-morrow, and that I am to attend\nto the business, and send his personal letters to ----,\" naming a city\nnot a hundred miles away.\n\n\"How long is he going to stay?\"\n\n\"He didn't say,\" answered Mr. Canterfield.\n\n\"I'll tell you what he ought to do,\" said the lady.  \"He ought to make\nyou a partner in the firm, and then he could go away and stay as long\nas he pleased.\"\n\n\"He can do that now,\" returned her husband.  \"He has made a good many\ntrips since I have been with him, and things have gone on very much in\nthe same way as when he is here.  He knows that.\"\n\n\"But still you'd like to be a partner?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Mr. Canterfield.\n\n\"And common gratitude ought to prompt him to make you one,\" said his\nwife.\n\nMr. Tolman went home and wrote a will.  He left all his property, with\nthe exception of a few legacies, to the richest and most powerful\ncharitable organization in the country.\n\n\"People will think I am crazy,\" said he to himself, \"and if I should\ndie while I am carrying out my plan, I will leave the task of defending\nmy sanity to people who are able to make a good fight for me.\"  And\nbefore he went to bed his will was signed and witnessed.\n\nThe next day he packed a trunk and left for the neighboring city.  His\napartments were to be kept in readiness for his return at any time.  If\nyou had seen him walking over to the railroad depot, you would have\ntaken him for a man of forty-five.\n\nWhen he arrived at his destination, Mr. Tolman established himself\ntemporarily at a hotel, and spent the next three or four days in\nwalking about the city looking for what he wanted.  What he wanted was\nrather difficult to define, but the way in which he put the matter to\nhimself was something like this:\n\n\"I would like to find a snug little place where, I can live, and carry\non some business which I can attend to myself, and which will bring me\ninto contact with people of all sorts--people who will interest me.  It\nmust be a small business, because I don't want to have to work very\nhard, and it must be snug and comfortable, because I want to enjoy it.\nI would like a shop of some sort, because that brings a man face to\nface with his fellow-creatures.\"\n\nThe city in which he was walking about was one of the best places in\nthe country in which to find the place of business he desired.  It was\nfull of independent little shops.  But Mr. Tolman could not readily\nfind one which resembled his ideal.  A small dry-goods establishment\nseemed to presuppose a female proprietor.  A grocery store would give\nhim many interesting customers; but he did not know much about\ngroceries, and the business did not appear to him to possess any\naesthetic features.\n\nHe was much pleased by a small shop belonging to a taxidermist.  It was\nexceedingly cosey, and the business was probably not so great as to\noverwork any one.  He might send the birds and beasts which were\nbrought to be stuffed to some practical operator, and have him put them\nin proper condition for the customers.  He might--  But no.  It would\nbe very unsatisfactory to engage in a business of which he knew\nabsolutely nothing.  A taxidermist ought not to blush with ignorance\nwhen asked some simple question about a little dead bird or a defunct\nfish.  And so he tore himself from the window of this fascinating\nplace, where, he fancied, had his education been differently managed,\nhe could in time have shown the world the spectacle of a cheerful and\nunblighted Mr. Venus.\n\nThe shop which at last appeared to suit him best was one which he had\npassed and looked at several times before it struck him favorably.  It\nwas in a small brick house in a side street, but not far from one of\nthe main business avenues of the city.  The shop seemed devoted to\narticles of stationery and small notions of various kinds not easy to\nbe classified.  He had stopped to look at three penknives fastened to a\ncard, which was propped up in the little show-window, supported on one\nside by a chess-board with \"History of Asia\" in gilt letters on the\nback, and on the other by a small violin labelled \"1 dollar.\"  And as\nhe gazed past these articles into the interior of the shop, which was\nnow lighted up, it gradually dawned upon him that it was something like\nhis ideal of an attractive and interesting business place.  At any\nrate, he would go in and look at it.  He did not care for a violin,\neven at the low price marked on the one in the window, but a new\npocket-knife might be useful.  So he walked in and asked to look at\npocket-knives.\n\nThe shop was in charge of a very pleasant old lady of about sixty, who\nsat sewing behind the little counter.  While she went to the window and\nvery carefully reached over the articles displayed therein to get the\ncard of penknives, Mr. Tolman looked about him.  The shop was quite\nsmall, but there seemed to be a good deal in it.  There were shelves\nbehind the counter, and there were shelves on the opposite wall, and\nthey all seemed well filled with something or other.  In the corner\nnear the old lady's chair was a little coal stove with a bright fire in\nit, and at the back of the shop, at the top of two steps, was a glass\ndoor partly open, through which he saw a small room, with a red carpet\non the floor, and a little table apparently set for a meal.\n\nMr. Tolman looked at the knives when the old lady showed them to him,\nand after a good deal of consideration he selected one which he thought\nwould be a good knife to give to a boy.  Then he looked over some\nthings in the way of paper-cutters, whist-markers, and such small\nmatters, which were in a glass case on the counter.  And while he\nlooked at them he talked to the old lady.\n\nShe was a friendly, sociable body, very glad to have any one to talk\nto, and so it was not at all difficult for Mr. Tolman, by some general\nremarks, to draw from her a great many points about herself and her\nshop.  She was a widow, with a son who, from her remarks, must have\nbeen forty years old.  He was connected with a mercantile\nestablishment, and they had lived here for a long time.  While her son\nwas a salesman, and came home every evening, this was very pleasant.\nBut after he became a commercial traveller, and was away from the city\nfor months at a time, she did not like it at all.  It was very lonely\nfor her.\n\nMr. Tolman's heart rose within him, but he did not interrupt her.\n\n\"If I could do it,\" said she, \"I would give up this place, and go and\nlive with my sister in the country.  It would be better for both of us,\nand Henry could come there just as well as here when he gets back from\nhis trips.\"\n\n\"Why don't you sell out?\" asked Mr. Tolman, a little fearfully, for he\nbegan to think that all this was too easy sailing to be entirely safe.\n\n\"That would not be easy,\" said she, with a smile.  \"It might be a long\ntime before we could find any one who would want to take the place.  We\nhave a fair trade in the store, but it isn't what it used to be when\ntimes were better.  And the library is falling off, too.  Most of the\nbooks are getting pretty old, and it don't pay to spend much money for\nnew ones now.\"\n\n\"The library!\" said Mr. Tolman.  \"Have you a library?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied the old lady.  \"I've had a circulating library here\nfor nearly fifteen years.  There it is on those two upper shelves\nbehind you.\"\n\nMr. Tolman turned, and beheld two long rows of books in brown-paper\ncovers, with a short step-ladder, standing near the door of the inner\nroom, by which these shelves might be reached.  This pleased him\ngreatly.  He had had no idea that there was a library here.\n\n\"I declare!\" said he.  \"It must be very pleasant to manage a\ncirculating library--a small one like this, I mean.  I shouldn't mind\ngoing into a business of the kind myself.\"\n\nThe old lady looked up, surprised.  Did he wish to go into business?\nShe had not supposed that, just from looking at him.\n\nMr. Tolman explained his views to her.  He did not tell what he had\nbeen doing in the way of business, or what Mr. Canterfield was doing\nfor him now.  He merely stated his present wishes, and acknowledged to\nher that it was the attractiveness of her establishment that had led\nhim to come in.\n\n\"Then you do not want the penknife?\" she said quickly.\n\n\"Oh, yes, I do,\" said he.  \"And I really believe, if we can come to\nterms, that I would like the two other knives, together with the rest\nof your stock in trade.\"\n\nThe old lady laughed a little nervously.  She hoped very much indeed\nthat they could come to terms.  She brought a chair from the back room,\nand Mr. Tolman sat down with her by the stove to talk it over.  Few\ncustomers came in to interrupt them, and they talked the matter over\nvery thoroughly.  They both came to the conclusion that there would be\nno difficulty about terms, nor about Mr. Tolman's ability to carry on\nthe business after a very little instruction from the present\nproprietress.  When Mr. Tolman left, it was with the understanding that\nhe was to call again in a couple of days, when the son Henry would be\nat home, and matters could be definitely arranged.\n\nWhen the three met, the bargain was soon struck.  As each party was so\ndesirous of making it, few difficulties were interposed.  The old lady,\nindeed, was in favor of some delay in the transfer of the\nestablishment, as she would like to clean and dust every shelf and\ncorner and every article in the place.  But Mr. Tolman was in a hurry\nto take possession; and as the son Henry would have to start off on\nanother trip in a short time, he wanted to see his mother moved and\nsettled before he left.  There was not much to move but trunks and\nbandboxes, and some antiquated pieces of furniture of special value to\nthe old lady, for Mr. Tolman insisted on buying everything in the\nhouse, just as it stood.  The whole thing did not cost him, he said to\nhimself, as much as some of his acquaintances would pay for a horse.\nThe methodical son Henry took an account of stock, and Mr. Tolman took\nseveral lessons from the old lady, in which she explained to him how to\nfind out the selling prices of the various articles from the marks on\nthe little tags attached to them.  And she particularly instructed him\nin the management of the circulating library.  She informed him of the\ncharacter of the books, and, as far as possible, of the character of\nthe regular patrons.  She told him whom he might trust to take out a\nbook without paying for the one brought in, if they didn't happen to\nhave the change with them, and she indicated with little crosses\nopposite their names those persons who should be required to pay cash\ndown for what they had had, before receiving further benefits.\n\nIt was astonishing to see what interest Mr. Tolman took in all this.\nHe was really anxious to meet some of the people about whom the old\nlady discoursed.  He tried, too, to remember a few of the many things\nshe told him of her methods of buying and selling, and the general\nmanagement of her shop; and he probably did not forget more than three\nfourths of what she told him.\n\nFinally everything was settled to the satisfaction of the two male\nparties to the bargain,--although the old lady thought of a hundred\nthings she would yet like to do,--and one fine frosty afternoon a\ncart-load of furniture and baggage left the door, the old lady and her\nson took leave of the old place, and Mr. Tolman was left sitting behind\nthe little counter, the sole manager and proprietor of a circulating\nlibrary and a stationery and notion shop.  He laughed when he thought\nof it, but he rubbed his hands and felt very well satisfied.\n\n\"There is nothing really crazy about it,\" he said to himself.  \"If\nthere is a thing that I think I would like, and I can afford to have\nit, and there's no harm in it, why not have it?\"\n\nThere was nobody there to say anything against this, so Mr. Tolman\nrubbed his hands again before the fire, and rose to walk up and down\nhis shop, and wonder who would be his first customer.\n\nIn the course of twenty minutes a little boy opened the door and came\nin.  Mr. Tolman hastened behind the counter to receive his commands.\nThe little boy wanted two sheets of note-paper and an envelope.\n\n\"Any particular kind!\" asked Mr. Tolman.\n\nThe boy didn't know of any particular variety being desired.  He\nthought the same kind she always got would do.  And he looked very hard\nat Mr. Tolman, evidently wondering at the change in the shopkeeper, but\nasking no questions.\n\n\"You are a regular customer, I suppose,\" said Mr. Tolman, opening\nseveral boxes of paper which he had taken down from the shelves.  \"I\nhave just begun business here, and don't know what kind of paper you\nhave been in the habit of buying.  But I suppose this will do.\"  And he\ntook out a couple of sheets of the best, with an envelope to match.\nThese he carefully tied up in a piece of thin brown paper, and gave to\nthe boy, who handed him three cents.  Mr. Tolman took them, smiled, and\nthen, having made a rapid calculation, he called to the boy, who was\njust opening the door, and gave him back one cent.\n\n\"You have paid me too much,\" he said.\n\nThe boy took the cent, looked at Mr. Tolman, and then got out of the\nstore as quickly as he could.\n\n\"Such profits as that are enormous,\" said Mr. Tolman, \"but I suppose\nthe small sales balance them.\"  This Mr. Tolman subsequently found to\nbe the case.\n\nOne or two other customers came in in the course of the afternoon, and\nabout dark the people who took out books began to arrive.  These kept\nMr. Tolman very busy.  He not only had to do a good deal of entering\nand cancelling, but he had to answer a great many questions about the\nchange in proprietorship, and the probability of his getting in some\nnew books, with suggestions as to the quantity and character of these,\nmingled with a few dissatisfied remarks in regard to the volumes\nalready on hand.\n\nEvery one seemed sorry that the old lady had gone away.  But Mr. Tolman\nwas so pleasant and anxious to please, and took such an interest in\ntheir selection of books, that only one of the subscribers appeared to\ntake the change very much to heart.  This was a young man who was\nforty-three cents in arrears.  He was a long time selecting a book, and\nwhen at last he brought it to Mr. Tolman to be entered, he told him in\na low voice that he hoped there would be no objection to letting his\naccount run on for a little while longer.  On the first of the month he\nwould settle it, and then he hoped to be able to pay cash whenever he\nbrought in a book.\n\nMr. Tolman looked for his name on the old lady's list, and, finding no\ncross against it, told him that it was all right, and that the first of\nthe month would do very well.  The young man went away perfectly\nsatisfied with the new librarian.  Thus did Mr. Tolman begin to build\nup his popularity.  As the evening grew on he found himself becoming\nvery hungry.  But he did not like to shut up the shop, for every now\nand then some one dropped in, sometimes to ask what time it was, and\nsometimes to make a little purchase, while there were still some\nlibrary patrons coming in at intervals.\n\nHowever, taking courage during a short rest from customers, he put up\nthe shutters, locked the door, and hurried off to a hotel, where he\npartook of a meal such as few keepers of little shops ever think of\nindulging in.\n\nThe next morning Mr. Tolman got his own breakfast.  This was\ndelightful.  He had seen how cosily the old lady had spread her table\nin the little back room, where there was a stove suitable for any\ncooking he might wish to indulge in, and he longed for such a cosey\nmeal.  There were plenty of stock provisions in the house, which he had\npurchased with the rest of the goods, and he went out and bought\nhimself a fresh loaf of bread.  Then he broiled a piece of ham, made\nsome good strong tea, boiled some eggs, and had a breakfast on the\nlittle round table which, though plain enough, he enjoyed more than any\nbreakfast at his club which he could remember.  He had opened the shop,\nand sat facing the glass door, hoping, almost, that there would be some\ninterruption to his meal.  It would seem so much more proper in that\nsort of business if he had to get up and go attend to a customer.\n\nBefore the evening of that day Mr. Tolman became convinced that he\nwould soon be obliged to employ a boy or some one to attend to the\nestablishment during his absence.  After breakfast, a woman recommended\nby the old lady came to make his bed and clean up generally, but when\nshe had gone he was left alone with his shop.  He determined not to\nallow this responsibility to injure his health, and so at one o'clock\nboldly locked the shop door and went out to his lunch.  He hoped that\nno one would call during his absence, but when he returned he found a\nlittle girl with a pitcher standing at the door.  She came to borrow\nhalf a pint of milk.\n\n\"Milk!\" exclaimed Mr. Tolman, in surprise.  \"Why, my child, I have no\nmilk.  I don't even use it in my tea.\"\n\nThe little girl looked very much disappointed.  \"Is Mrs. Walker gone\naway for good?\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Tolman.  \"But I would be just as willing to lend you\nthe milk as she would be, if I had any.  Is there any place near here\nwhere you can buy milk?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said the girl.  \"You can get it round in the market-house.\"\n\n\"How much would half a pint cost?\" he asked.\n\n\"Three cents,\" replied the girl.\n\n\"Well, then,\" said Mr. Tolman, \"here are three cents.  You can go and\nbuy the milk for me, and then you can borrow it.  Will that suit?\"\n\nThe girl thought it would suit very well, and away she went.\n\nEven this little incident pleased Mr. Tolman.  It was so very novel.\nWhen he came back from his dinner in the evening, he found two\ncirculating library subscribers stamping their feet on the door-step,\nand he afterwards heard that several others had called and gone away.\nIt would certainly injure the library if he suspended business at\nmeal-times.  He could easily have his choice of a hundred boys if he\nchose to advertise for one, but he shrank from having a youngster in\nthe place.  It would interfere greatly with his cosiness and his\nexperiences.  He might possibly find a boy who went to school, and who\nwould be willing to come at noon and in the evening if he were paid\nenough.  But it would have to be a very steady and responsible boy.  He\nwould think it over before taking any steps.\n\nHe thought it over for a day or two, but he did not spend his whole\ntime in doing so.  When he had no customers, he sauntered about in the\nlittle parlor over the shop, with its odd old furniture, its quaint\nprints on the walls, and its absurd ornaments on the mantelpiece.  The\nother little rooms seemed almost as funny to him, and he was sorry when\nthe bell on the shop door called him down from their contemplation.  It\nwas pleasant to him to think that he owned all these odd things.  The\nownership of the varied goods in the shop also gave him an agreeable\nfeeling which none of his other possessions had ever afforded him.  It\nwas all so odd and novel.\n\nHe liked much to look over the books in the library.  Many of them were\nold novels, the names of which were familiar enough to him, but which\nhe had never read.  He determined to read some of them as soon as he\nfelt fixed and settled.\n\nIn looking over the book in which the names and accounts of the\nsubscribers were entered, he amused himself by wondering what sort of\npersons they were who had out certain books.  Who, for instance, wanted\nto read \"The Book of Cats,\" and who could possibly care for \"The\nMysteries of Udolpho\"?  But the unknown person in regard to whom Mr.\nTolman felt the greatest curiosity was the subscriber who now had in\nhis possession a volume entitled \"Dormstock's Logarithms of the\nDiapason.\"\n\n\"How on earth,\" exclaimed Mr. Tolman, \"did such a book get into this\nlibrary?  And where on earth did the person spring from who would want\nto take it out?  And not only want to take it,\" he continued, as he\nexamined the entry regarding the volume, \"but come and have it renewed\none, two, three, four--nine times!  He has had that book for eighteen\nweeks!\"\n\nWithout exactly making up his mind to do so, Mr. Tolman deferred taking\nsteps toward getting an assistant until P.  Glascow, the person in\nquestion, should make an appearance, and it was nearly time for the\nbook to be brought in again.\n\n\"If I get a boy now,\" thought Mr. Tolman, \"Glascow will be sure to come\nand bring the book while I am out.\"\n\nIn almost exactly two weeks from the date of the last renewal of the\nbook, P. Glascow came in.  It was the middle of the afternoon, and Mr.\nTolman was alone.  This investigator of musical philosophy was a quiet\nyoung man of about thirty, wearing a light-brown cloak, and carrying\nunder one arm a large book.\n\nP. Glascow was surprised when he heard of the change in the\nproprietorship of the library.  Still, he hoped that there would be no\nobjection to his renewing the book which he had with him, and which he\nhad taken out some time ago.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Mr. Tolman, \"none in the world.  In fact, I don't\nsuppose there are any other subscribers who would want it.  I have had\nthe curiosity to look to see if it had ever been taken out before, and\nI find it has not.\"\n\nThe young man smiled quietly.  \"No,\" said he, \"I suppose not.  It is\nnot every one who would care to study the higher mathematics of music,\nespecially when treated as Dormstock treats the subject.\"\n\n\"He seems to go into it pretty deeply,\" remarked Mr. Tolman, who had\ntaken up the book.  \"At least, I should think so, judging from all\nthese calculations, and problems, and squares, and cubes.\"\n\n\"Indeed he does,\" said Glascow.  \"And although I have had the book some\nmonths, and have more reading time at my disposal than most persons, I\nhave only reached the fifty-sixth page, and doubt if I shall not have\nto review some of that before I can feel that I thoroughly understand\nit.\"\n\n\"And there are three hundred and forty pages in all!\" said Mr. Tolman,\ncompassionately.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the other.  \"But I am quite sure that the matter will\ngrow easier as I proceed.  I have found that out from what I have\nalready done.\"\n\n\"You say you have a good deal of leisure?\" remarked Mr. Tolman.  \"Is\nthe musical business dull at present?\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not in the musical business,\" said Glascow.  \"I have a great\nlove for music, and wish to thoroughly understand it.  But my business\nis quite different.  I am a night druggist, and that is the reason I\nhave so much leisure for reading.\"\n\n\"A night druggist?\" repeated Mr. Tolman, inquiringly.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the other.  \"I am in a large downtown drug store which\nis kept open all night, and I go on duty after the day clerks leave.\"\n\n\"And does that give you more leisure?\" asked Mr. Tolman.\n\n\"It seems to,\" answered Glascow.  \"I sleep until about noon, and then I\nhave the rest of the day, until seven o'clock, to myself.  I think that\npeople who work at night can make a more satisfactory use of their own\ntime than those who work in the daytime.  In the summer I can take a\ntrip on the river, or go somewhere out of town, every day, if I like.\"\n\n\"Daylight is more available for many things, that is true,\" said Mr.\nTolman.  \"But is it not dreadfully lonely sitting in a drug store all\nnight?  There can't be many people to come to buy medicine at night.  I\nthought there was generally a night-bell to drug stores, by which a\nclerk could be awakened if anybody wanted anything.\"\n\n\"It's not very lonely in our store at night,\" said Glascow.  \"In fact,\nit's often more lively then than in the daytime.  You see, we are right\ndown among the newspaper offices, and there's always somebody coming in\nfor soda-water, or cigars, or something or other.  The store is a\nbright, warm place for the night editors and reporters to meet together\nand talk and drink hot soda, and there's always a knot of 'em around\nthe stove about the time the papers begin to go to press.  And they're\na lively set, I can tell you, sir.  I've heard some of the best stories\nI ever heard in my life told in our place after three o'clock in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"A strange life!\" said Mr. Tolman.  \"Do you know, I never thought that\npeople amused themselves in that way--and night after night, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, night after night, Sundays and all.\"\n\nThe night druggist now took up his book.\n\n\"Going home to read?\" asked Mr. Tolman.\n\n\"Well, no,\" said the other.  \"It's rather cold this afternoon to read.\nI think I'll take a brisk walk.\"\n\n\"Can't you leave your book until you return!\" asked Mr. Tolman.  \"That\nis, if you will come back this way.  It's an awkward book to carry\nabout.\"\n\n\"Thank you, I will,\" said Glascow.  \"I shall come back this way.\"\n\nWhen he had gone, Mr. Tolman took up the book, and began to look over\nit more carefully than he had done before.  But his examination did not\nlast long.\n\n\"How anybody of common sense can take any interest in this stuff is\nbeyond my comprehension,\" said Mr. Tolman, as he closed the book and\nput it on a little shelf behind the counter.\n\nWhen Glascow came back, Mr. Tolman asked him to stay and warm himself.\nAnd then, after they had talked for a short time, Mr. Tolman began to\nfeel hungry.  He had his winter appetite, and had lunched early.  So\nsaid he to the night druggist, who had opened his \"Dormstock,\"  \"How\nwould you like to sit here and read awhile, while I go and get my\ndinner?  I will light the gas, and you can be very comfortable here, if\nyou are not in a hurry.\"\n\nP. Glascow was in no hurry at all, and was very glad to have some quiet\nreading by a warm fire; and so Mr. Tolman left him, feeling perfectly\nconfident that a man who had been allowed by the old lady to renew a\nbook nine times must be perfectly trustworthy.\n\nWhen Mr. Tolman returned, the two had some further conversation in the\ncorner by the little stove.\n\n\"It must be rather annoying,\" said the night druggist, \"not to be able\nto go out to your meals without shutting up your shop.  If you like,\"\nsaid he, rather hesitatingly, \"I will stop in about this time in the\nafternoon, and stay here while you go to dinner.  I'll be glad to do\nthis until you get an assistant.  I can easily attend to most people\nwho come in, and others can wait.\"\n\nMr. Tolman jumped at this proposition.  It was exactly what he wanted.\n\nSo P. Glascow came every afternoon and read \"Dormstock\" while Mr.\nTolman went to dinner; and before long he came at lunch-time also.  It\nwas just as convenient as not, he said.  He had finished his breakfast,\nand would like to read awhile.  Mr. Tolman fancied that the night\ndruggist's lodgings were, perhaps, not very well warmed, which idea\nexplained the desire to walk rather than read on a cold afternoon.\nGlascow's name was entered on the free list, and he always took away\nthe \"Dormstock\" at night, because he might have a chance of looking\ninto it at the store, when custom began to grow slack in the latter\npart of the early morning.\n\nOne afternoon there came into the shop a young lady, who brought back\ntwo books which she had had for more than a month.  She made no excuses\nfor keeping the books longer than the prescribed time, but simply\nhanded them in and paid her fine.  Mr. Tolman did not like to take this\nmoney, for it was the first of the kind he had received; but the young\nlady looked as if she were well able to afford the luxury of keeping\nbooks over their time, and business was business.  So he gravely gave\nher her change.  Then she said she would like to take out \"Dormstock's\nLogarithms of the Diapason.\"\n\nMr. Tolman stared at her.  She was a bright, handsome young lady, and\nlooked as if she had very good sense.  He could not understand it.  But\nhe told her the book was out.\n\n\"Out!\" she said.  \"Why, it's always out.  It seems strange to me that\nthere should be such a demand for that book.  I have been trying to get\nit for ever so long.\"\n\n\"It IS strange,\" said Mr. Tolman, \"but it is certainly in demand.  Did\nMrs. Walker ever make you any promises about it?\"\n\n\"No,\" said she, \"but I thought my turn would come around some time.\nAnd I particularly want the book just now.\"\n\nMr. Tolman felt somewhat troubled.  He knew that the night druggist\nought not to monopolize the volume, and yet he did not wish to\ndisoblige one who was so useful to him, and who took such an earnest\ninterest in the book.  And he could not temporize with the young lady,\nand say that he thought the book would soon be in.  He knew it would\nnot.  There were three hundred and forty pages of it.  So he merely\nremarked that he was sorry.\n\n\"So am I,\" said the young lady, \"very sorry.  It so happens that just\nnow I have a peculiar opportunity for studying that book which may not\noccur again.\"\n\nThere was something in Mr. Tolman's sympathetic face which seemed to\ninvite her confidence, and she continued.\n\n\"I am a teacher,\" she said, \"and on account of certain circumstances I\nhave a holiday for a month, which I intended to give up almost entirely\nto the study of music, and I particularly wanted \"Dormstock.\"  Do you\nthink there is any chance of its early return, and will you reserve it\nfor me?\"\n\n\"Reserve it!\" said Mr. Tolman.  \"Most certainly I will.\"  And then he\nreflected a second or two.  \"If you will come here the day after\nto-morrow, I will be able to tell you something definite.\"\n\nShe said she would come.\n\nMr. Tolman was out a long time at lunch-time the next day.  He went to\nall the leading book-stores to see if he could buy a copy of\nDormstock's great work.  But he was unsuccessful.  The booksellers told\nhim that there was no probability that he could get a copy in the\ncountry, unless, indeed, he found it in the stock of some second-hand\ndealer, and that even if he sent to England for it, where it was\npublished, it was not likely he could get it, for it had been long out\nof print.  There was no demand at all for it.  The next day he went to\nseveral second-hand stores, but no \"Dormstock\" could he find.\n\nWhen he came back he spoke to Glascow on the subject.  He was sorry to\ndo so, but thought that simple justice compelled him to mention the\nmatter.  The night druggist was thrown into a perturbed state of mind\nby the information that some one wanted his beloved book.\n\n\"A woman!\" he exclaimed.  \"Why, she would not understand two pages out\nof the whole of it.  It is too bad.  I didn't suppose any one would\nwant this book.\"\n\n\"Do not disturb yourself too much,\" said Mr. Tolman.  \"I am not sure\nthat you ought to give it up.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to hear you say so,\" said Glascow.  \"I have no doubt it\nis only a passing fancy with her.  I dare say she would really rather\nhave a good new novel.\"  And then, having heard that the lady was\nexpected that afternoon, he went out to walk, with the \"Dormstock\"\nunder his arm.\n\nWhen the young lady arrived, an hour or so later, she was not at all\nsatisfied to take out a new novel, and was very sorry indeed not to\nfind the \"Logarithms of the Diapason\" waiting for her.  Mr. Tolman told\nher that he had tried to buy another copy of the work, and for this she\nexpressed herself gratefully.  He also found himself compelled to say\nthat the book was in the possession of a gentleman who had had it for\nsome time--all the time it had been out, in fact--and had not yet\nfinished it.\n\nAt this the young lady seemed somewhat nettled.\n\n\"Is it not against the rules for any person to keep one book out so\nlong?\" she asked.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Tolman.  \"I have looked into that.  Our rules are very\nsimple, and merely say that a book may be renewed by the payment of a\ncertain sum.\"\n\n\"Then I am never to have it?\" remarked the young lady.\n\n\"Oh, I wouldn't despair about it,\" said Mr. Tolman.  \"He has not had\ntime to reflect upon the matter.  He is a reasonable young man, and I\nbelieve that he will be willing to give up his study of the book for a\ntime and let you take it.\"\n\n\"No,\" said she, \"I don't wish that.  If he is studying, as you say he\nis, day and night, I do not wish to interrupt him.  I should want the\nbook at least a month, and that, I suppose, would upset his course of\nstudy entirely.  But I do not think any one should begin in a\ncirculating library to study a book that will take him a year to\nfinish; for, from what you say, it will take this gentleman at least\nthat time to finish Dormstock's book.\" So she went her way.\n\nWhen P. Glascow heard all this in the evening, he was very grave.  He\nhad evidently been reflecting.\n\n\"It is not fair,\" said he.  \"I ought not to keep the book so long.  I\nnow give it up for a while.  You may let her have it when she comes.\"\nAnd he put the \"Dormstock\" on the counter, and went and sat down by the\nstove.\n\nMr. Tolman was grieved.  He knew the night druggist had done right, but\nstill he was sorry for him.  \"What will you do?\" he asked.  \"Will you\nstop your studies?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Glascow, gazing solemnly into the stove.  \"I will take\nup some other books on the diapason which I have, and so will keep my\nideas fresh on the subject until this lady is done with the book.  I do\nnot really believe she will study it very long.\"  Then he added:  \"If\nit is all the same to you, I will come around here and read, as I have\nbeen doing, until you shall get a regular assistant.\"\n\nMr. Tolman would be delighted to have him come, he said.  He had\nentirely given up the idea of getting an assistant, but this he did not\nsay.\n\nIt was some time before the lady came back, and Mr. Tolman was afraid\nshe was not coming at all.  But she did come, and asked for Mrs.\nBurney's \"Evelina.\"  She smiled when she named the book, and said that\nshe believed she would have to take a novel, after all, and she had\nalways wanted to read that one.\n\n\"I wouldn't take a novel if I were you,\" said Mr. Tolman; and he\ntriumphantly took down the \"Dormstock\" and laid it before her.\n\nShe was evidently much pleased, but when he told her of Mr. Glascow's\ngentlemanly conduct in the matter, her countenance instantly changed.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said she, laying down the book.  \"I will not break up his\nstudy.  I will take the `Evelina' if you please.\"\n\nAnd as no persuasion from Mr. Tolman had any effect upon her, she went\naway with Mrs. Burney's novel in her muff.\n\n\"Now, then,\" said Mr. Tolman to Glascow, in the evening, \"you may as\nwell take the book along with you.  She won't have it.\"\n\nBut Glascow would do nothing of the kind.  \"No,\" he remarked, as he sat\nlooking into the stove.  \"When I said I would let her have it, I meant\nit.  She'll take it when she sees that it continues to remain in the\nlibrary.\"\n\nGlascow was mistaken: she did not take it, having the idea that he\nwould soon conclude that it would be wiser for him to read it than to\nlet it stand idly on the shelf.\n\n\"It would serve them both right,\" said Mr. Tolman to himself, \"if\nsomebody else should come and take it.\"  But there was no one else\namong his subscribers who would even think of such a thing.\n\nOne day, however, the young lady came in and asked to look at the book.\n\"Don't think that I am going to take it out,\" she said, noticing Mr.\nTolman's look of pleasure as he handed her the volume.  \"I only wish to\nsee what he says on a certain subject which I am studying now.\"  And so\nshe sat down by the stove on the chair which Mr. Tolman placed for her,\nand opened \"Dormstock.\"\n\nShe sat earnestly poring over the book for half an hour or more, and\nthen she looked up and said:  \"I really cannot make out what this part\nmeans.  Excuse my troubling you, but I would be very glad if you would\nexplain the latter part of this passage.\"\n\n\"Me!\" exclaimed Mr. Tolman.  \"Why, my good madam,--miss, I mean,--I\ncouldn't explain it to you if it were to save my life.  But what page\nis it?\" said he, looking at his watch.\n\n\"Page twenty-four,\" answered the young lady.\n\n\"Oh, well, then,\" said he, \"if you can wait ten or fifteen minutes, the\ngentleman who has had the book will be here, and I think he can explain\nanything in the first part of the work.\"\n\nThe young lady seemed to hesitate whether to wait or not; but as she\nhad a certain curiosity to see what sort of a person he was who had\nbeen so absorbed in the book, she concluded to sit a little longer and\nlook into some other parts of the volume.\n\nThe night druggist soon came in, and when Mr. Tolman introduced him to\nthe lady, he readily agreed to explain the passage to her if he could.\nSo Mr. Tolman got him a chair from the inner room, and he also sat down\nby the stove.\n\nThe explanation was difficult, but it was achieved at last, and then\nthe young lady broached the subject of leaving the book unused.  This\nwas discussed for some time, but came to nothing, although Mr. Tolman\nput down his afternoon paper and joined in the argument, urging, among\nother points, that as the matter now stood he was deprived by the\ndead-lock of all income from the book.  But even this strong argument\nproved of no avail.\n\n\"Then I will tell you what I wish you would do,\" said Mr. Tolman, as\nthe young lady rose to go: \"come here and look at the book whenever you\nwish to do so.  I would like to make this more of a reading-room,\nanyway.  It would give me more company.\"\n\nAfter this the young lady looked into \"Dormstock\" when she came in; and\nas her holidays had been extended by the continued absence of the\nfamily in which she taught, she had plenty of time for study, and came\nquite frequently.  She often met Glascow in the shop, and on such\noccasions they generally consulted \"Dormstock,\" and sometimes had quite\nlengthy talks on musical matters.  One afternoon they came in together,\nhaving met on their way to the library, and entered into a conversation\non diapasonic logarithms, which continued during the lady's stay in the\nshop.\n\n\"The proper thing,\" thought Mr. Tolman, \"would be for these two people\nto get married.  Then they could take the book and study it to their\nheart's content.  And they would certainly suit each other, for they\nare both greatly attached to musical mathematics and philosophy, and\nneither of them either plays or sings, as they have told me.  It would\nbe an admirable match.\"\n\nMr. Tolman thought over this matter a good deal, and at last determined\nto mention it to Glascow.  When he did so, the young man colored, and\nexpressed the opinion that it would be of no use to think of such a\nthing.  But it was evident from his manner and subsequent discourse\nthat he had thought of it.\n\nMr. Tolman gradually became quite anxious on the subject, especially as\nthe night druggist did not seem inclined to take any steps in the\nmatter.  The weather was now beginning to be warmer, and Mr. Tolman\nreflected that the little house and the little shop were probably much\nmore cosey and comfortable in winter than in summer.  There were higher\nbuildings all about the house, and even now he began to feel that the\ncirculation of air would be quite as agreeable as the circulation of\nbooks.  He thought a good deal about his airy rooms in the neighboring\ncity.\n\n\"Mr. Glascow,\" said he, one afternoon, \"I have made up my mind to sell\nout this business shortly.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the other.  \"Do you mean you will give it up and go\naway--leave the place altogether?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Mr. Tolman, \"I shall give up the place entirely, and\nleave the city.\"\n\nThe night druggist was shocked.  He had spent many happy hours in that\nshop, and his hours there were now becoming pleasanter than ever.  If\nMr. Tolman went away, all this must end.  Nothing of the kind could be\nexpected of any new proprietor.\n\n\"And considering this,\" continued Mr. Tolman, \"I think it would be well\nfor you to bring your love matters to a conclusion while I am here to\nhelp you.\"\n\n\"My love matters!\" exclaimed Mr. Glascow, with a flush.\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" said Mr. Tolman.  \"I have eyes, and I know all about\nit.  Now let me tell you what I think.  When a thing is to be done, it\nought to be done the first time there is a good chance.  That's the way\nI do business.  Now you might as well come around here to-morrow\nafternoon prepared to propose to Miss Edwards.  She is due to-morrow,\nfor she has been two days away.  If she doesn't come, we will postpone\nthe matter until the next day.  But you should be ready to-morrow.  I\ndon't believe you can see her much when you don't meet her here, for\nthat family is expected back very soon, and from what I infer from her\naccount of her employers, you won't care to visit her at their house.\"\n\nThe night druggist wanted to think about it.\n\n\"There is nothing to think,\" said Mr. Tolman.  \"We know all about the\nlady.\"  (He spoke truly, for he had informed himself about both parties\nto the affair.)  \"Take my advice, and be here to-morrow afternoon--and\ncome rather early.\"\n\nThe next morning Mr. Tolman went up to his parlor on the second floor,\nand brought down two blue stuffed chairs, the best he had, and put them\nin the little room back of the shop.  He also brought down one or two\nknickknacks and put them on the mantelpiece, and he dusted and\nbrightened up the room as well as he could.  He even covered the table\nwith a red cloth from the parlor.\n\nWhen the young lady arrived, he invited her to walk into the back room\nto look over some new books he had just got in.  If she had known he\nproposed to give up the business, she would have thought it rather\nstrange that he should be buying new books.  But she knew nothing of\nhis intentions.  When she was seated at the table whereon the new books\nwere spread, Mr. Tolman stepped outside of the shop door to watch for\nGlascow's approach.  He soon appeared.\n\n\"Walk right in,\" said Mr. Tolman.  \"She's in the back room looking over\nbooks.  I'll wait here, and keep out customers as far as possible.\nIt's pleasant, and I want a little fresh air.  I'll give you twenty\nminutes.\"\n\nGlascow was pale, but he went in without a word, and Mr. Tolman, with\nhis hands under his coat-tail, and his feet rather far apart,\nestablished a blockade on the doorstep.  He stood there for some time,\nlooking at the people outside, and wondering what the people inside\nwere doing.  The little girl who had borrowed the milk of him, and who\nhad never returned it, was about to pass the door; but seeing him\nstanding there, she crossed over to the other side of the street.  But\nhe did not notice her.  He was wondering if it was time to go in.  A\nboy came up to the door, and wanted to know if he kept Easter eggs.\nMr. Tolman was happy to say he did not.  When he had allowed the night\ndruggist a very liberal twenty minutes, he went in.  As he entered the\nshop door, giving the bell a very decided ring as he did so, P. Glascow\ncame down the two steps that led from the inner room.  His face showed\nthat it was all right with him.\n\nA few days after this Mr. Tolman sold out his stock, good will, and\nfixtures, together with the furniture and lease of the house.  And who\nshould he sell out to but to Mr. Glascow!  This piece of business was\none of the happiest points in the whole affair.  There was no reason\nwhy the happy couple should not be married very soon, and the young\nlady was charmed to give up her position as teacher and governess in a\nfamily, and come and take charge of that delightful little store and\nthat cunning little house, with almost everything in it that they\nwanted.\n\nOne thing in the establishment Mr. Tolman refused to sell.  That was\nDormstock's great work.  He made the couple a present of the volume,\nand between two of the earlier pages he placed a bank-note which in\nvalue was very much more than that of the ordinary wedding gift.\n\n\"What are YOU going to do?\" they asked of him, when all these things\nwere settled.  And then he told them how he was going back to his\nbusiness in the neighboring city, and he told them what it was, and how\nhe had come to manage a circulating library.  They did not think him\ncrazy.  People who studied the logarithms of the diapason would not be\napt to think a man crazy for such a little thing as that.\n\nWhen Mr. Tolman returned to the establishment of Pusey & Co., he found\neverything going on very satisfactorily.\n\n\"You look ten years younger, sir,\" said Mr. Canterfield.  \"You must\nhave had a very pleasant time.  I did not think there was enough to\ninterest you in ---- for so long a time.\"\n\n\"Interest me!\" exclaimed Mr. Tolman.  \"Why, objects of interest crowded\non me.  I never had a more enjoyable holiday in my life.\"\n\nWhen he went home that evening (and he found himself quite willing to\ngo), he tore up the will he had made.  He now felt that there was no\nnecessity for proving his sanity.\n\n\n\n\nMY UNWILLING NEIGHBOR\n\nI was about twenty-five years old when I began life as the owner of a\nvineyard in western Virginia.  I bought a large tract of land, the\ngreater part of which lay upon the sloping side of one of the\nfoot-hills of the Blue Ridge, the exposure being that most favorable to\nthe growth of the vine.  I am an enthusiastic lover of the country and\nof country life, and believed that I should derive more pleasure as\nwell as profit from the culture of my far-stretching vineyard than I\nwould from ordinary farm operations.\n\nI built myself a good house of moderate size upon a little plateau on\nthe higher part of my estate.  Sitting in my porch, smoking my pipe\nafter the labors of the day, I could look down over my vineyard into a\nbeautiful valley, with here and there a little curling smoke arising\nfrom some of the few dwellings which were scattered about among the\ngroves and spreading fields, and above this beauty I could imagine all\nmy hillside clothed in green and purple.\n\nMy family consisted of myself alone.  It is true that I expected some\nday that there would be others in my house besides myself, but I was\nnot ready for this yet.\n\nDuring the summer I found it very pleasant to live by myself.  It was a\nnovelty, and I could arrange and manage everything in my own fashion,\nwhich was a pleasure I had not enjoyed when I lived in my father's\nhouse.  But when winter came I found it very lonely.  Even my servants\nlived in a cabin at some little distance, and there were many dark and\nstormy evenings when the company even of a bore would have been welcome\nto me.  Sometimes I walked over to the town and visited my friends\nthere, but this was not feasible on stormy nights, and the winter\nseemed to me a very long one.\n\nBut spring came, outdoor operations began, and for a few weeks I felt\nagain that I was all-sufficient for my own pleasure and comfort.  Then\ncame a change.  One of those seasons of bad and stormy weather which so\nfrequently follow an early spring settled down upon my spirits and my\nhillside.  It rained, it was cold, fierce winds blew, and I became more\nanxious for somebody to talk to than I had been at any time during the\nwinter.\n\nOne night, when a very bad storm was raging, I went to bed early, and\nas I lay awake I revolved in my mind a scheme of which I had frequently\nthought before.  I would build a neat little house on my grounds, not\nvery far away from my house, but not too near, and I would ask Jack\nBrandiger to come there and live.  Jack was a friend of mine who was\nreading law in the town, and it seemed to me that it would be much more\npleasant, and even more profitable, to read law on a pretty hillside\noverlooking a charming valley, with woods and mountains behind and\nabove him, where he could ramble to his heart's content.\n\nI had thought of asking Jack to come and live with me, but this idea I\nsoon dismissed.  I am a very particular person, and Jack was not.  He\nleft his pipes about in all sorts of places--sometimes when they were\nstill lighted.  When he came to see me he was quite as likely to put\nhis hat over the inkstand as to put it anywhere else.  But if Jack\nlived at a little distance, and we could go backward and forward to see\neach other whenever we pleased, that would be quite another thing.  He\ncould do as he pleased in his own house, and I could do as I pleased in\nmine, and we might have many pleasant evenings together.  This was a\ncheering idea, and I was planning how we might arrange with the negro\nwoman who managed my household affairs to attend also to those of Jack\nwhen I fell asleep.\n\nI did not sleep long before I was awakened by the increased violence of\nthe storm.  My house shook with the fury of the wind.\n\nThe rain seemed to be pouring on its roof and northern side as if there\nwere a waterfall above us, and every now and then I could hear a shower\nof hailstones rattling against the shutters.  My bedroom was one of the\nrooms on the lower floor, and even there I could hear the pounding of\nthe deluge and the hailstones upon the roof.\n\nAll this was very doleful, and had a tendency to depress the spirits of\na man awake and alone in a good-sized house.  But I shook off this\ndepression.  It was, not agreeable to be up here by myself in such a\nterrible storm, but there was nothing to be afraid of, as my house was\nnew and very strongly built, being constructed of logs, weather-boarded\noutside and ceiled within.  It would require a hurricane to blow off\nthe roof, and I believed my shutters to be hail-proof.  So, as there\nwas no reason to stay awake, I turned over and went to sleep.\n\nI do not know how long it was before I was awakened again, this time\nnot by the noise of the storm, but by a curious movement of my\nbedstead.  I had once felt the slight shock of an earthquake, and it\nseemed to me that this must be something of the kind.  Certainly my bed\nmoved under me.  I sat up.  The room was pitchy dark.  In a moment I\nfelt another movement, but this time it did not seem to me to resemble\nan earthquake shock.  Such motion, I think, is generally in horizontal\ndirections, while that which I felt was more like the movement of a\nship upon the water.  The storm was at its height; the wind raged and\nroared, and the rain seemed to be pouring down as heavily as ever.\n\nI was about to get up and light the lamp, for even the faintest\ncandle-flame would be some sort of company at such a grewsome moment,\nwhen my bedstead gave another movement, more shiplike than before.  It\nactually lurched forward as if it were descending into the trough of\nthe sea, but, unlike a ship, it did not rise again, but remained in\nsuch a slanting position that I began to slide down toward the foot.  I\nbelieve that if it had not been a bedstead provided with a footboard, I\nshould have slipped out upon the floor.\n\nI did not jump out of bed.  I did not do anything.  I was trying to\nthink, to understand the situation, to find out whether I was asleep or\nawake, when I became aware of noises in the room and all over the house\nwhich even through the din of the storm made themselves noticed by\ntheir peculiarity.  Tables, everything in the room, seemed to be\ngrating and grinding on the floor, and in a moment there was a crash.\nI knew what that meant; my lamp had slipped off the table.  Any doubt\non that point would have been dispelled by the smell of kerosene which\nsoon filled the air of the room.\n\nThe motion of the bed, which I now believe must have been the motion of\nthe whole house, still continued; but the grating noises in the room\ngradually ceased, from which I inferred that the furniture had brought\nup against the front wall of the room.\n\nIt now was impossible for me to get up and strike a light, for to do so\nwith kerosene oil all over the floor and its vapor diffused through the\nroom would probably result in setting the house on fire.  So I must\nstay in darkness and wait.  I do not think I was very much\nfrightened--I was so astonished that there was no room in my mind for\nfear.  In fact, all my mental energies were occupied in trying to find\nout what had happened.  It required, however, only a few more minutes\nof reflection, and a few more minutes of the grating, bumping,\ntrembling of my house, to enable me to make up my mind what was\nhappening.  My house was sliding downhill!\n\nThe wind must have blown the building from its foundations, and upon\nthe slippery surface of the hillside, probably lashed into liquid mud\nby the pouring rain, it was making its way down toward the valley!  In\na flash my mind's eye ran over the whole surface of the country beneath\nme as far as I knew it.  I was almost positive that there was no\nprecipice, no terrible chasm into which my house might fall.  There was\nnothing but sloping hillside, and beneath that a wide stretch of fields.\n\nNow there was a new and sudden noise of heavy objects falling upon the\nroof, and I knew what that meant: my chimney had been wrenched from its\nfoundations, and the upper part of it had now toppled over.  I could\nhear, through the storm, the bricks banging and sliding upon the\nslanting roof.  Continuous sounds of cracking and snapping came to me\nthrough the closed front windows, and these were caused, I supposed, by\nthe destruction of the stakes of my vines as the heavy house moved over\nthem.\n\nOf course, when I thoroughly understood the state of the case, my first\nimpulse was to spring out of bed, and, as quickly as possible, to get\nout of that thumping and sliding house.  But I restrained myself.  The\nfloor might be covered with broken glass, I might not be able to find\nmy clothes in the darkness and in the jumble of furniture at the end of\nthe room, and even if I could dress myself, it would be folly to jump\nout in the midst of that raging storm into a probable mass of wreckage\nwhich I could not see.  It would be far better to remain dry and warm\nunder my roof.  There was no reason whatever to suppose that the house\nwould go to pieces, or that it would turn over.  It must stop some time\nor other, and, until it did so, I would be safer in my bed than\nanywhere else.  Therefore in my bed I stayed.\n\nSitting upright, with my feet pressed against the footboard, I listened\nand felt.  The noises of the storm, and the cracking and the snapping\nand grinding before me and under me, still continued, although I\nsometimes thought that the wind was moderating a little, and that the\nstrange motion was becoming more regular.  I believed the house was\nmoving faster than when it first began its strange career, but that it\nwas sliding over a smooth surface.  Now I noticed a succession of loud\ncracks and snaps at the front of the house, and, from the character of\nthe sounds, I concluded that my little front porch, which had been\nacting as a cutwater at the bow of my shiplike house, had yielded at\nlast to the rough contact with the ground, and would probably soon be\ntorn away.  This did not disturb me, for the house must still be firm.\n\nIt was not long before I perceived that the slanting of my bed was\nbecoming less and less, and also I was quite sure that the house was\nmoving more slowly.  Then the crackings and snappings before my front\nwall ceased altogether.  The bed resumed its ordinary horizontal\nposition, and although I did not know at what moment the house had\nceased sliding and had come to a standstill, I was sure that it had\ndone so.  It was now resting upon a level surface.  The room was still\nperfectly dark, and the storm continued.  It was useless for me to get\nup until daylight came,--I could not see what had happened,--so I lay\nback upon my pillow and tried to imagine upon what level portion of my\nfarm I had stranded.  While doing this I fell asleep.\n\nWhen I woke, a little light was stealing into the room through the\nblinds of my shutters.  I quickly slipped out of bed, opened a window,\nand looked out.  Day was just breaking, the rain and wind had ceased,\nand I could discern objects.  But it seemed as if I needed some light\nin my brain to enable me to comprehend what I saw.  My eyes fell upon\nnothing familiar.\n\nI did not stop to investigate, however, from my window.  I found my\nclothes huddled together with the furniture at the front end of the\nroom, and as soon as I was dressed I went into the hall and then to my\nfront door.  I quickly jerked this open and was about to step outside\nwhen, suddenly, I stopped.  I was positive that my front porch had been\ndestroyed.  But there I saw a porch a little lower than mine and a\ngreat deal wider, and on the other side of it, not more than eight feet\nfrom me, was a window--the window of a house, and on the other side of\nthe window was a face--the face of a young girl!  As I stood staring in\nblank amazement at the house which presented itself at my front door,\nthe face at the window disappeared, and I was left to contemplate the\nscene by myself.  I ran to my back door and threw it open.  There I\nsaw, stretching up the fields and far up the hillside, the wide path\nwhich my house had made as it came down from its elevated position to\nthe valley beneath, where it had ended its onward career by stopping up\nagainst another house.  As I looked from the back porch I saw that the\nground still continued to slope, so that if my house had not found in\nits path another building, it would probably have proceeded somewhat\nfarther on its course.  It was lighter, and I saw bushes and fences and\noutbuildings--I was in a back yard.\n\nAlmost breathless with amazement and consternation, I ran again to the\nfront door.  When I reached it I found a young woman standing on the\nporch of the house before me.  I was about to say something--I know not\nwhat--when she put her finger on her lips and stepped forward.\n\n\"Please don't speak loudly,\" she said.  \"I am afraid it will frighten\nmother.  She is asleep yet.  I suppose you and your house have been\nsliding downhill?\"\n\n\"That is what has happened,\" said I.  \"But I cannot understand it.  It\nseems to me the most amazing thing that ever took place on the face of\nthe earth.\"\n\n\"It is very queer,\" said she, \"but hurricanes do blow away houses, and\nthat must have been a hurricane we had last night, for the wind was\nstrong enough to loosen any house.  I have often wondered if that house\nwould ever slide downhill.\"\n\n\"My house?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.  \"Soon after it was built I began to think what a nice\nclean sweep it could make from the place where it seemed to be stuck to\nthe side of the mountain, right down here into the valley.\"\n\nI could not talk with a girl like this; at least, I could not meet her\non her own conversational grounds.  I was so agitated myself that it\nseemed unnatural that any one to whom I should speak should not also be\nagitated.\n\n\"Who are you?\" I asked rather brusquely.  \"At least, to whom does this\nhouse belong?\"\n\n\"This is my mother's house,\" said she.  \"My mother is Mrs. Carson.  We\nhappen just now to be living here by ourselves, so I cannot call on any\nman to help you do anything.  My brother has always lived with us, but\nlast week he went away.\"\n\n\"You don't seem to be a bit astonished at what has happened,\" said I.\n\nShe was rather a pretty girl, of a cheerful disposition, I should say,\nfor several times she had smiled as she spoke.\n\n\"Oh, I am astonished,\" she answered; \"or, at least, I was.  But I have\nhad time enough to get over some of it.  It was at least an hour ago\nwhen I was awakened by hearing something crack in the yard.  I went to\na window and looked out, and could just barely see that something like\na big building had grown up during the night.  Then I watched it, and\nwatched it, until I made out it was a whole house; and after that it\nwas not long before I guessed what had happened.  It seemed a simpler\nthing to me, you know, than it did to you, because I had often thought\nabout it, and probably you never had.\"\n\n\"You are right there,\" said I, earnestly.  \"It would have been\nimpossible for me to imagine such a thing.\"\n\n\"At first I thought there was nobody in the house,\" said she, \"but when\nI heard some one moving about, I came down to tell whoever had arrived\nnot to make a noise.  I see,\" she added, with another of her smiles,\n\"that you think I am a very strange person not to be more flurried by\nwhat has happened.  But really I cannot think of anything else just\nnow, except what mother will say and do when she comes down and finds\nyou and your house here at the back door.  I am very sure she will not\nlike it.\"\n\n\"Like it!\" I exclaimed.  \"Who on earth could like it?\"\n\n\"Please speak more gently,\" she said.  \"Mother is always a little\nirritable when her night's rest has been broken, and I would not like\nto have her wakened up suddenly now.  But really, Mr. Warren, I haven't\nthe least idea in the world how she will take this thing.  I must go in\nand be with her when she wakes, so that I can explain just what has\nhappened.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" I said.  \"You know my name.\"\n\n\"Of course I know your name,\" she answered.  \"Could that house be up\nthere on the hillside for more than a year without my knowing who lived\nin it?\"  With this she went indoors.\n\nI could not help smiling when I thought of the young lady regretting\nthat there was no man in the house who might help me do something.\nWhat could anybody do in a case like this?  I turned and went into my\nhouse.  I entered the various rooms on the lower floor, and saw no\nsigns of any particular damage, except that everything movable in each\nroom was jumbled together against the front wall.  But when I looked\nout of the back door I found that the porch there was a good deal\nwrecked, which I had not noticed before.\n\nI went up-stairs, and found everything very much as it was below.\nNothing seemed to have been injured except the chimney and the porches.\nI thanked my stars that I had used hard wood instead of mortar for the\nceilings of my rooms.\n\nI was about to go into my bedroom, when I heard a woman scream, and of\ncourse I hurried to the front.  There on the back porch of her house\nstood Mrs. Carson.  She was a woman of middle age, and, as I glanced at\nher, I saw where her daughter got her good looks.  But the placidity\nand cheerfulness of the younger face were entirely wanting in the\nmother.  Her eyes sparkled, her cheeks were red, her mouth was partly\nopened, and it seemed to me that I could almost see that her breath was\nhot.\n\n\"Is this your house?\" she cried, the moment her eyes fell upon me.\n\"And what is it doing here?\"  I did not immediately answer, I looked at\nthe angry woman, and behind her I saw, through the open door, the\ndaughter crossing the hallway.  It was plain that she had decided to\nlet me have it out with her mother without interference.  As briefly\nand as clearly as I could, I explained what had happened.\n\n\"What is all that to me?\" she screamed.  \"It doesn't matter to me how\nyour house got here.  There have been storms ever since the beginning\nof the world, and I never heard of any of them taking a house into a\nperson's back yard.  You ought not to have built your house where any\nsuch thing could happen.  But all this is nothing to me.  I don't\nunderstand now how your house did get here, and I don't want to\nunderstand it.  All I want is for you to take it away.\"\n\n\"I will do that, madam, just as soon as I can.  You may be very sure I\nwill do that.  But--\"\n\n\"Can you do it now?\" she asked.  \"Can you do it to-day?  I don't want a\nminute lost.  I have not been outside to see what damage has been done,\nbut the first thing to do is to take your house away.\"\n\n\"I am going to the town now, madam, to summon assistance.\"\n\nMrs. Carson made no answer, but she turned and walked to the end of her\nporch.  There she suddenly gave a scream which quickly brought her\ndaughter from the house.  \"Kitty!  Kitty!\" cried her mother.  \"Do you\nknow what he has done?  He has gone right over my round flower-garden.\nHis house is sitting on it this minute!\"\n\n\"But he could not help it, mother,\" said Kitty.\n\n\"Help it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Carson.  \"I didn't expect him to help it.\nWhat I want--\"  Suddenly she stopped.  Her eyes flashed brighter, her\nmouth opened wider, and she became more and more excited as she noticed\nthe absence of the sheds, fences, or vegetable-beds which had found\nthemselves in the course of my all-destroying dwelling.\n\nIt was now well on in the morning, and some of the neighbors had become\naware of the strange disaster which had happened to me, although if\nthey had heard the news from Mrs. Carson they might have supposed that\nit was a disaster which had happened only to her.  As they gazed at the\ntwo houses so closely jammed together, all of them wondered, some of\nthem even laughed, but not one offered a suggestion which afforded\nsatisfaction to Mrs. Carson or myself.  The general opinion was that,\nnow my house was there, it would have to stay there, for there were not\nenough horses in the State to pull it back up that mountainside.  To be\nsure, it might possibly be drawn off sidewise.  But whether it was\nmoved one way or the other, a lot of Mrs. Carson's trees would have to\nbe cut down to let it pass.\n\n\"Which shall never happen!\" cried that good lady.  \"If nothing else can\nbe done, it must be taken apart and hauled off in carts.  But no matter\nhow it is managed, it must be moved, and that immediately.\"  Miss\nCarson now prevailed upon her mother to go into the house, and I stayed\nand talked to the men and a few women who had gathered outside.\n\nWhen they had said all they had to say, and seen all there was to see,\nthese people went home to their breakfasts.  I entered my house, but\nnot by the front door, for to do that I would have been obliged to\ntrespass upon Mrs. Carson's back porch.  I got my hat, and was about to\nstart for the town, when I heard my name called.  Turning into the\nhall, I saw Miss Carson, who was standing at my front door.\n\n\"Mr. Warren,\" said she, \"you haven't any way of getting breakfast, have\nyou?\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said I.  \"My servants are up there in their cabin, and I\nsuppose they are too much scared to come down.  But I am going to town\nto see what can be done about my house, and will get my breakfast\nthere.\"\n\n\"It's a long way to go without anything to eat,\" she said, \"and we can\ngive you some breakfast.  But I want to ask you something.  I am in a\ngood deal of perplexity.  Our two servants are out at the front of the\nhouse, but they positively refuse to come in; they are afraid that your\nhouse may begin sliding again and crush them all, so, I shall have to\nget breakfast.  But what bothers me is trying to find our well.  I have\nbeen outside, and can see no signs of it.\"\n\n\"Where was your well?\" I gasped.\n\n\"It ought to be somewhere near the back of your house,\" she said.  \"May\nI go through your hall and look out?\"\n\n\"Of course you may,\" I cried, and I preceded her to my back door.\n\n\"Now, it seems to me,\" she said, after surveying the scene of\ndesolation immediately before, and looking from side to side toward\nobjects which had remained untouched, \"that your house has passed\ndirectly over our well, and must have carried away the little shed and\nthe pump and everything above ground.  I should not wonder a bit,\" she\ncontinued slowly, \"if it is under your porch.\"\n\nI jumped to the ground, for the steps were shattered, and began to\nsearch for the well, and it was not long before I discovered its round\ndark opening, which was, as Miss Carson had imagined, under one end of\nmy porch.\n\n\"What can we do?\" she asked.  \"We can't have breakfast or get along at\nall without water.\"  It was a terribly depressing thing to me to think\nthat I, or rather my house, had given these people so much trouble.\nBut I speedily, assured Miss Carson that if she could find a bucket and\na rope which I could lower into the well, I would provide her with\nwater.\n\nShe went into her house to see what she could find, and I tore away the\nbroken planks of the porch, so that I could get to the well.  And then,\nwhen she came with a tin pail and a clothes-line, I went to work to\nhaul up water and carry it to her back door.\n\n\"I don't want mother to find out what has happened to the well,\" she\nsaid, \"for she has enough on her mind already.\"\n\nMrs. Carson was a woman with some good points in her character.  After\na time she called to me herself, and told me to come in to breakfast.\nBut during the meal she talked very earnestly to me about the amazing\ntrespass I had committed, and about the means which should be taken to\nrepair the damages my house had done to her property.  I was as\noptimistic as I could be, and the young lady spoke very cheerfully and\nhopefully about the affair, so that we were beginning to get along\nsomewhat pleasantly, when, suddenly, Mrs. Carson sprang to her feet.\n\"Heavens and earth!\" she cried, \"this house is moving!\"\n\nShe was not mistaken.  I had felt beneath my feet a sudden sharp\nshock--not severe, but unmistakable.  I remembered that both houses\nstood upon slightly sloping ground.  My blood turned cold, my heart\nstood still; even Miss Carson was pale.\n\nWhen we had rushed out of doors to see what had happened, or what was\ngoing to happen, I soon found that we had been needlessly frightened.\nSome of the broken timbers on which my house had been partially resting\nhad given way, and the front part of the building had slightly\ndescended, jarring as it did so the other house against which it\nrested.  I endeavored to prove to Mrs. Carson that the result was\nencouraging rather than otherwise, for my house was now more firmly\nsettled than it had been.  But she did not value the opinion of a man\nwho did not know enough to put his house in a place where it would be\nlikely to stay, and she could eat no more breakfast, and was even\nafraid to stay under her own roof until experienced mechanics had been\nsummoned to look into the state of affairs.\n\nI hurried away to the town, and it was not long before several\ncarpenters and masons were on the spot.  After a thorough examination,\nthey assured Mrs. Carson that there was no danger, that my house would\ndo no farther damage to her premises, but, to make things certain, they\nwould bring some heavy beams and brace the front of my house against\nher cellar wall.  When that should be done it would be impossible for\nit to move any farther.\n\n\"But I don't want it braced!\" cried Mrs. Carson.  \"I want it taken\naway.  I want it out of my back yard!\"\n\nThe master carpenter was a man of imagination and expedients.  \"That is\nquite another thing, ma'am,\" said he.  \"We'll fix this gentleman's\nhouse so that you needn't be afraid of it, and then, when the time\ncomes to move it, there's several ways of doing that.  We might rig up\na powerful windlass at the top of the hill, and perhaps get a\nsteam-engine to turn it, and we could fasten cables to the house and\nhaul her back to where she belongs.\"\n\n\"And can you take your oaths,\" cried Mrs. Carson, \"that those ropes\nwon't break, and when that house gets half-way up the hill it won't\ncome sliding down ten times faster than it did, and crash into me and\nmine and everything I own on earth?  No, sir!  I'll have no house\nhauled up a hill back of me!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the carpenter, \"it would be a great deal easier to\nmove it on this ground, which is almost level--\"\n\n\"And cut down my trees to do it!  No, sir!\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said he, \"there is no way to do but to take it apart and\nhaul it off.\"\n\n\"Which would make an awful time at the back of my house while you were\ndoing it!\" exclaimed Mrs. Carson.\n\nI now put in a word.  \"There's only one thing to do that I can see!\" I\nexclaimed.  \"I will sell it to a match factory.  It is almost all wood,\nand it can be cut up in sections about two inches thick, and then split\ninto matches.\"\n\nKitty smiled.  \"I should like to see them,\" she said, \"taking away the\nlittle sticks in wheelbarrows!\"\n\n\"There is no need of trifling on the subject,\" said Mrs. Carson.  \"I\nhave had a great deal to bear, and I must bear it no longer than is\nnecessary.  I have just found out that in order to get water out of my\nown well, I must go to the back porch of a stranger.  Such things\ncannot be endured.  If my son George were here, he would tell me what I\nought to do.  I shall write to him, and see what he advises.  I do not\nmind waiting a little bit, now that I know that you can fix Mr.\nWarren's house so that it won't move any farther.\"\n\nThus the matter was left.  My house was braced that afternoon, and\ntoward evening I started to go to a hotel in the town to spend the\nnight.\n\n\"No, sir!\" said Mrs. Carson.  \"Do you suppose that I am going to stay\nhere all night with a great empty house jammed up against me, and\neverybody knowing that it is empty?  It will be the same as having\nthieves in my own house to have them in yours.  You have come down here\nin your property, and you can stay in it and take care of it!\"\n\n\"I don't object to that in the least,\" I said.  \"My two women are here,\nand I can tell them to attend to my meals.  I haven't any chimney, but\nI suppose they can make a fire some way or other.\"\n\n\"No, sir!\" said Mrs. Carson.  \"I am not going to have any strange\nservants on my place.  I have just been able to prevail upon my own\nwomen to go into the house, and I don't want any more trouble.  I have\nhad enough already!\"\n\n\"But, my dear madam,\" said I, \"you don't want me to go to the town, and\nyou won't allow me to have any cooking done here.  What am I to do?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"you can eat with us.  It may be two or three days\nbefore I can hear from my son George, and in the meantime you can lodge\nin your own house and I will take you to board.  That is the best way I\ncan see of managing the thing.  But I am very sure I am not going to be\nleft here alone in the dreadful predicament in which you have put me.\"\n\nWe had scarcely finished supper when Jack Brandiger came to see me.  He\nlaughed a good deal a about my sudden change of base, but thought, on\nthe whole, my house had made a very successful move.  It must be more\npleasant in the valley than up on that windy hill.  Jack was very much\ninterested in everything, and when Mrs. Carson and her daughter\nappeared, as we were walking about viewing the scene, I felt myself\nobliged to introduce him.\n\n\"I like those ladies,\" said he to me, afterwards.  \"I think you have\nchosen very agreeable neighbors.\"\n\n\"How do you know you like them?\" said I.  \"You had scarcely anything to\nsay to Mrs. Carson.\"\n\n\"No, to be sure,\" said he.  \"But I expect I should like her.  By the\nway, do you know how you used to talk to me about coming and living\nsomewhere near you?  How would you like me to take one of your rooms\nnow?  I might cheer you up.\"\n\n\"No,\" said I, firmly.  \"That cannot be done.  As things are now, I have\nas much as I can do to get along here by myself.\"\n\nMrs. Carson did not hear from her son for nearly a week, and then he\nwrote that he found it almost impossible to give her any advice.  He\nthought it was a very queer state of affairs.  He had never heard of\nanything like it.  But he would try and arrange his business so that he\ncould come home in a week or two and look into matters.\n\nAs I was thus compelled to force myself upon the close neighborhood of\nMrs. Carson and her daughter,  I endeavored to make things as pleasant\nas possible.  I brought some of my men down out of the vineyard, and\nset them to repairing fences, putting the garden in order, and doing\nall that I could to remedy the doleful condition of things which I had\nunwillingly brought into the back yard of this quiet family.  I rigged\nup a pump on my back porch by which the water of the well could be\nconveniently obtained, and in every way endeavored to repair damages.\n\nBut Mrs. Carson never ceased to talk about the unparalleled disaster\nwhich had come upon her, and she must have had a great deal of\ncorrespondence with her son George, because she gave me frequent\nmessages from him.  He could not come on to look into the state of\naffairs, but he seemed to be giving it a great deal of thought and\nattention.\n\nSpring weather had come again, and it was very pleasant to help the\nCarson ladies get their flower-garden in order--at least, as much as\nwas left of it, for my house was resting upon some of the most\nimportant beds.  As I was obliged to give up all present idea of doing\nanything in the way of getting my residence out of a place where it had\nno business to be, because Mrs. Carson would not consent to any plan\nwhich had been suggested, I felt that I was offering some little\ncompensation in beautifying what seemed to be, at that time, my own\ngrounds.\n\nMy labors in regard to vines, bushes, and all that sort of thing were\ngenerally carried on under direction of Mrs. Carson or her daughter,\nand as the elderly lady was a very busy housewife, the horticultural\nwork was generally left to Miss Kitty and me.\n\nI liked Miss Kitty.  She was a cheerful, whole-souled person, and I\nsometimes thought that she was not so unwilling to have me for a\nneighbor as the rest of the family seemed to be; for if I were to judge\nthe disposition of her brother George from what her mother told me\nabout his letters, both he and Mrs. Carson must be making a great many\nplans to get me off the premises.\n\nNearly a month had now passed since my house and I made that remarkable\nmorning call upon Mrs. Carson.  I was becoming accustomed to my present\nmode of living, and, so far as I was concerned, it satisfied me very\nwell.  I certainly lived a great deal better than when I was depending\nupon my old negro cook.  Miss Kitty seemed to be satisfied with things\nas they were, and so, in some respects, did her mother.  But the latter\nnever ceased to give me extracts from some of her son George's letters,\nand this was always annoying and worrying to me.  Evidently he was not\npleased with me as such a close neighbor to his mother, and it was\nastonishing how many expedients he proposed in order to rid her of my\nundesirable proximity.\n\n\"My son George,\" said Mrs. Carson, one morning, \"has been writing to me\nabout jack-screws.  He says that the greatest improvements have been\nmade in jack-screws.\"\n\n\"What do you do with them, mother?\" asked Miss Kitty.\n\n\"You lift houses with them,\" said she.  \"He says that in large cities\nthey lift whole blocks of houses with them and build stories\nunderneath.  He thinks that we can get rid of our trouble here if we\nuse jack-screws.\"\n\n\"But how does he propose to use them?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh, he has a good many plans,\" answered Mrs. Carson.  \"He said that he\nshould not wonder if jack-screws could be made large enough to lift\nyour house entirely over mine and set it out in the road, where it\ncould be carried away without interfering with anything, except, of\ncourse, vehicles which might be coming along.  But he has another\nplan--that is, to lift my house up and carry it out into the field on\nthe other side of the road, and then your house might be carried along\nright over the cellar until it got to the road.  In that way, he says,\nthe bushes and trees would not have to be interfered with.\"\n\n\"I think brother George is cracked!\" said Kitty.\n\nAll this sort of thing worried me very much.  My mind was eminently\ndisposed toward peace and tranquillity, but who could be peaceful and\ntranquil with a prospective jack-screw under the very base of his\ncomfort and happiness?  In fact, my house had never been such a happy\nhome as it was at that time.  The fact of its unwarranted position upon\nother people's grounds had ceased to trouble me.\n\nBut the coming son George, with his jack-screws, did trouble me very\nmuch, and that afternoon I deliberately went into Mrs. Carson's house\nto look for Kitty.  I knew her mother was not at home, for I had seen\nher go out.  When Kitty appeared I asked her to come out on her back\nporch.  \"Have you thought of any new plan of moving it?\" she said, with\na smile, as we sat down.\n\n\"No,\" said I, earnestly.  \"I have not, and I don't want to think of any\nplan of moving it.  I am tired of seeing it here, I am tired of\nthinking about moving it away, and I am tired of hearing people talk\nabout moving it.  I have not any right to be here, and I am never\nallowed to forget it.  What I want to do is to go entirely away, and\nleave everything behind me--except one thing.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" asked Kitty.\n\n\"You,\" I answered.\n\nShe turned a little pale and did not reply.\n\n\"You understand me, Kitty,\" I said.  \"There is nothing in the world\nthat I care for but you.  What have you to say to me?\"\n\nThen came back to her her little smile.  \"I think it would be very\nfoolish for us to go away,\" she said.\n\nIt was about a quarter of an hour after this when Kitty proposed that\nwe should go out to the front of the house; it would look queer if any\nof the servants should come by and see us sitting together like that.\nI had forgotten that there were other people in the world, but I went\nwith her.\n\nWe were standing on the front porch, close to each other, and I think\nwe were holding each other's hands, when Mrs. Carson came back.  As she\napproached she looked at us inquiringly, plainly wishing to know why we\nwere standing side by side before her door as if we had some special\nobject in so doing.\n\n\"Well?\" said she, as she came up the steps.  Of course it was right\nthat I should speak, and, in as few words as possible, I told her what\nKitty and I had been saying to each other.  I never saw Kitty's mother\nlook so cheerful and so handsome as when she came forward and kissed\nher daughter and shook hands with me.  She seemed so perfectly\nsatisfied that it amazed me.  After a little Kitty left us, and then\nMrs. Carson asked me to sit by her on a rustic bench.\n\n\"Now,\" said she, \"this will straighten out things in the very best way.\nWhen you are married, you and Kitty can live in the back\nbuilding,--for, of course, your house will now be the same thing as a\nback building,--and you can have the second floor.  We won't have any\nseparate tables, because it will be a great deal nicer for you and\nKitty to live with me, and it will simply be your paying board for two\npersons instead of one.  And you know you can manage your vineyard just\nas well from the bottom of the hill as from the top.  The lower rooms\nof what used to be your house can be made very pleasant and comfortable\nfor all of us.  I have been thinking about the room on the right that\nyou had planned for a parlor, and it will make a lovely sitting-room\nfor us, which is a thing we have never had, and the room on the other\nside is just what will suit beautifully for a guest-chamber.  The two\nhouses together, with the roof of my back porch properly joined to the\nfront of your house, will make a beautiful and spacious dwelling.  It\nwas fortunate, too, that you painted your house a light yellow.  I have\noften looked at the two together, and thought what a good thing it was\nthat one was not one color and the other another.  As to the pump, it\nwill be very easy now to put a pipe from what used to be your back\nporch to our kitchen, so that we can get water without being obliged to\ncarry it.  Between us we can make all sorts of improvements, and some\ntime I will tell you of a good many that I have thought of.\n\n\"What used to be your house,\" she continued, \"can be jack-screwed up a\nlittle bit and a good foundation put under it.  I have inquired about\nthat.  Of course it would not have been proper to let you know that I\nwas satisfied with the state of things, but I was satisfied, and there\nis no use of denying it.  As soon as I got over my first scare after\nthat house came down the hill, and had seen how everything might be\narranged to suit all parties, I said to myself, `What the Lord has\njoined together, let not man put asunder,' and so, according to my\nbelief, the strongest kind of jack-screws could not put these two\nhouses asunder, any more than they could put you and Kitty asunder, now\nthat you have agreed to take each other for each other's own.\"\n\nJack Brandiger came to call that evening, and when he had heard what\nhad happened he whistled a good deal.  \"You are a funny kind of a\nfellow,\" said he.  \"You go courting like a snail, with your house on\nyour back!\"\n\nI think my friend was a little discomfited.  \"Don't be discouraged,\nJack,\" said I. \"You will get a good wife some of these days--that is,\nif you don't try to slide uphill to find her!\"\n\n\n\n\nOUR ARCHERY CLUB\n\nWhen an archery club was formed in our village, I was among the first\nto join it.  But I should not, on this account, claim any extraordinary\nenthusiasm on the subject of archery, for nearly all the ladies and\ngentlemen of the place were also among the first to join.\n\nFew of us, I think, had a correct idea of the popularity of archery in\nour midst until the subject of a club was broached.  Then we all\nperceived what a strong interest we felt in the study and use of the\nbow and arrow.  The club was formed immediately, and our thirty members\nbegan to discuss the relative merits of lancewood, yew, and greenheart\nbows, and to survey yards and lawns for suitable spots for setting up\ntargets for home practice.\n\nOur weekly meetings, at which we came together to show in friendly\ncontest how much our home practice had taught us, were held upon the\nvillage green, or rather upon what had been intended to be the village\ngreen.  This pretty piece of ground, partly in smooth lawn and partly\nshaded by fine trees, was the property of a gentleman of the place, who\nhad presented it, under certain conditions, to the township.  But as\nthe township had never fulfilled any of the conditions, and had done\nnothing toward the improvement of the spot, further than to make it a\ngrazing-place for local cows and goats, the owner had withdrawn his\ngift, shut out the cows and goats by a picket fence, and, having locked\nthe gate, had hung up the key in his barn.  When our club was formed,\nthe green, as it was still called, was offered to us for our meetings,\nand, with proper gratitude, we elected its owner to be our president.\n\nThis gentleman was eminently qualified for the presidency of an archery\nclub.  In the first place, he did not shoot: this gave him time and\nopportunity to attend to the shooting of others.  He was a tall and\npleasant man, a little elderly.  This \"elderliness,\" if I may so put\nit, seemed, in his case, to resemble some mild disorder, like a gentle\nrheumatism, which, while it prevented him from indulging in all the\nwild hilarities of youth, gave him, in compensation, a position, as one\nentitled to a certain consideration, which was very agreeable to him.\nHis little disease was chronic, it is true, and it was growing upon\nhim; but it was, so far, a pleasant ailment.\n\nAnd so, with as much interest in bows and arrows and targets and\nsuccessful shots as any of us, he never fitted an arrow to a string,\nnor drew a bow.  But he attended every meeting, settling disputed\npoints (for he studied all the books on archery), encouraging the\ndisheartened, holding back the eager ones who would run to the targets\nas soon as they had shot, regardless of the fact that others were still\nshooting and that the human body is not arrow-proof, and shedding about\nhim that general aid and comfort which emanates from a good fellow, no\nmatter what he may say or do.\n\nThere were persons--outsiders--who said that archery clubs always\nselected ladies for their presiding officers, but we did not care to be\ntoo much bound down and trammelled by customs and traditions.  Another\nclub might not have among its members such a genial elderly gentleman\nwho owned a village green.\n\nI soon found myself greatly interested in archery, especially when I\nsucceeded in planting an arrow somewhere within the periphery of the\ntarget, but I never became such an enthusiast in bow-shooting as my\nfriend Pepton.\n\nIf Pepton could have arranged matters to suit himself, he would have\nbeen born an archer.  But as this did not happen to have been the case,\nhe employed every means in his power to rectify what he considered this\nserious error in his construction.  He gave his whole soul, and the\ngreater part of his spare time, to archery, and as he was a young man\nof energy, this helped him along wonderfully.\n\nHis equipments were perfect.  No one could excel him in, this respect.\nHis bow was snakewood, backed with hickory.  He carefully rubbed it\ndown every evening with oil and beeswax, and it took its repose in a\ngreen baize bag.  His arrows were Philip Highfield's best, his strings\nthe finest Flanders hemp.  He had shooting-gloves, and little leather\ntips that could be screwed fast on the ends of what he called his\nstring-fingers.  He had a quiver and a belt, and when equipped for the\nweekly meetings, he carried a fancy-colored wiping-tassel, and a little\nebony grease-pot hanging from his belt.  He wore, when shooting, a\npolished arm-guard or bracer, and if he had heard of anything else that\nan archer should have, he straightway would have procured it.\n\nPepton was a single man, and he lived with two good old maiden ladies,\nwho took as much care of him as if they had been his mothers.  And he\nwas such a good, kind fellow that he deserved all the attention they\ngave him.  They felt a great interest in his archery pursuits, and\nshared his anxious solicitude in the selection of a suitable place to\nhang his bow.\n\n\"You see,\" said he, \"a fine bow like this, when not in use, should\nalways be in a perfectly dry place.\"\n\n\"And when in use, too,\" said Miss Martha, \"for I am sure that you\noughtn't to be standing and shooting in any damp spot.  There's no\nsurer way of gettin' chilled.\"\n\nTo which sentiment Miss Maria agreed, and suggested wearing rubber\nshoes, or having a board to stand on, when the club met after a rain.\n\nPepton first hung his bow in the hall, but after he had arranged it\nsymmetrically upon two long nails (bound with green worsted, lest they\nshould scratch the bow through its woollen cover), he reflected that\nthe front door would frequently be open, and that damp drafts must\noften go through the hall.  He was sorry to give up this place for his\nbow, for it was convenient and appropriate, and for an instant he\nthought that it might remain, if the front door could be kept shut, and\nvisitors admitted through a little side door which the family generally\nused, and which was almost as convenient as the other--except, indeed,\non wash-days, when a wet sheet or some article of wearing apparel was\napt to be hung in front of it.  But although wash-day occurred but once\na week, and although it was comparatively easy, after a little\npractice, to bob under a high-propped sheet, Pepton's heart was too\nkind to allow his mind to dwell upon this plan.  So he drew the nails\nfrom the wall of the hall, and put them up in various places about the\nhouse.  His own room had to be aired a great deal in all weathers, and\nso that would not do at all.  The wall above the kitchen fireplace\nwould be a good location, for the chimney was nearly always warm.  But\nPepton could not bring himself to keep his bow in the kitchen.  There\nwould be nothing esthetic about such a disposition of it, and, besides,\nthe girl might be tempted to string and bend it.  The old ladies really\ndid not want it in the parlor, for its length and its green baize cover\nwould make it an encroaching and unbecoming neighbor to the little\nengravings and the big samplers, the picture-frames of acorns and\npine-cones, the fancifully patterned ornaments of clean wheat straw,\nand all the quaint adornments which had hung upon those walls for so\nmany years.  But they did not say so.  If it had been necessary, to\nmake room for the bow, they would have taken down the pencilled\nprofiles of their grandfather, their grandmother, and their father when\na little boy, which hung in a row over the mantelpiece.\n\nHowever, Pepton did not ask this sacrifice.  In the summer evenings the\nparlor windows must be open.  The dining-room was really very little\nused in the evening, except when Miss Maria had stockings to darn, and\nthen she always sat in that apartment, and of course she had the\nwindows open.  But Miss Maria was very willing to bring her work into\nthe parlor,--it was foolish, anyway, to have a feeling about darning\nstockings before chance company,--and then the dining-room could be\nkept shut up after tea.  So into the wall of that neat little room\nPepton drove his worsted-covered nails, and on them carefully laid his\nbow.  All the next day Miss Martha and Miss Maria went about the house,\ncovering the nail-holes he had made with bits of wallpaper, carefully\nsnipped out to fit the patterns, and pasted on so neatly that no one\nwould have suspected they were there.\n\nOne afternoon, as I was passing the old ladies' house, saw, or thought\nI saw, two men carrying in a coffin.  I was struck with alarm.\n\n\"What!\" I thought.  \"Can either of those good women--  Or can Pepton--\"\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, I rushed in behind the men.  There, at\nthe foot of the stairs, directing them, stood Pepton.  Then it was not\nhe!  I seized him sympathetically by the hand.\n\n\"Which?\" I faltered.  \"Which?  Who is that coffin for?\"\n\n\"Coffin!\" cried Pepton.  \"Why, my dear fellow, that is not a coffin.\nThat is my ascham.\"\n\n\"Ascham?\" I exclaimed.  \"What is that?\"\n\n\"Come and look at it,\" he said, when the men had set it on end against\nthe wall.  \"It is an upright closet or receptacle for an archer's\narmament.  Here is a place to stand the bow, here are supports for the\narrows and quivers, here are shelves and hooks, on which to lay or hang\neverything the merry man can need.  You see, moreover, that it is lined\nwith green plush, that the door fits tightly, so that it can stand\nanywhere, and there need be no fear of drafts or dampness affecting my\nbow.  Isn't it a perfect thing?  You ought to get one.\"\n\nI admitted the perfection, but agreed no further.  I had not the income\nof my good Pepton.\n\nPepton was, indeed, most wonderfully well equipped; and yet, little did\nthose dear old ladies think, when they carefully dusted and\nreverentially gazed at the bunches of arrows, the arm-bracers, the\ngloves, the grease-pots, and all the rest of the paraphernalia of\narchery, as it hung around Pepton's room, or when they afterwards\nallowed a particular friend to peep at it, all arranged so orderly\nwithin the ascham, or when they looked with sympathetic, loving\nadmiration on the beautiful polished bow, when it was taken out of its\nbag--little did they think, I say, that Pepton was the very poorest\nshot in the club.  In all the surface of the much-perforated targets of\nthe club, there was scarcely a hole that he could put his hand upon his\nheart and say he made.\n\nIndeed, I think it was the truth that Pepton was born not to be an\narcher.  There were young fellows in the club who shot with bows that\ncost no more than Pepton's tassels, but who could stand up and whang\narrows into the targets all the afternoon, if they could get a chance;\nand there were ladies who made hits five times out of six; and there\nwere also all the grades of archers common to any club.  But there was\nno one but himself in Pepton's grade.  He stood alone, and it was never\nany trouble to add up his score.\n\nYet he was not discouraged.  He practised every day except Sundays, and\nindeed he was the only person in the club who practised at night.  When\nhe told me about this, I was a little surprised.\n\n\"Why, it's easy enough,\" said he.  \"You see, I hung a lantern, with a\nreflector, before the target, just a little to one side.  It lighted up\nthe target beautifully, and I believe there was a better chance of\nhitting it than by daylight, for the only thing you could see was the\ntarget, and so your attention was not distracted.  To be sure,\" he\nsaid, in answer to a question, \"it was a good deal of trouble to find\nthe arrows, but that I always have.  When I get so expert that I can\nput all the arrows into the target, there will be no trouble of the\nkind, night or day.  However,\" he continued, \"I don't practise any more\nby night.  The other evening I sent an arrow slam-bang into the\nlantern, and broke it all to flinders.  Borrowed lantern, too.\nBesides, I found it made Miss Martha very nervous to have me shooting\nabout the house after dark.  She had a friend who had a little boy who\nwas hit in the leg by an arrow from a bow, which, she says,\naccidentally went off in the night, of its own accord.  She is\ncertainly a little mixed in her mind in regard to this matter, but I\nwish to respect her feelings, and so shall not use another lantern.\"\n\nAs I have said, there were many good archers among the ladies of our\nclub.  Some of them, after we had been organized for a month or two,\nmade scores that few of the gentlemen could excel.  But the lady who\nattracted the greatest attention when she shot was Miss Rosa.\n\nWhen this very pretty young lady stood up before the ladies'\ntarget--her left side well advanced, her bow firmly held out in her\nstrong left arm, which never quivered, her head a little bent to the\nright, her arrow drawn back by three well-gloved fingers to the tip of\nher little ear, her dark eyes steadily fixed upon the gold, and her\ndress, well fitted over her fine and vigorous figure, falling in\ngraceful folds about her feet, we all stopped shooting to look at her.\n\n\"There is something statuesque about her,\" said Pepton, who ardently\nadmired her, \"and yet there isn't.  A statue could never equal her\nunless we knew there was a probability of movement in it.  And the only\nstatues which have that are the Jarley wax-works, which she does not\nresemble in the least.  There is only one thing that that girl needs to\nmake her a perfect archer, and that is to be able to aim better.\"\n\nThis was true.  Miss Rosa did need to aim better.  Her arrows had a\ncurious habit of going on all sides of the target, and it was very\nseldom that one chanced to stick into it.  For if she did make a hit,\nwe all knew it was chance and that there was no probability of her\ndoing it again.  Once she put an arrow right into the centre of the\ngold,--one of the finest shots ever made on the ground,--but she didn't\nhit the target again for two weeks.  She was almost as bad a shot as\nPepton, and that is saying a good deal.\n\nOne evening I was sitting with Pepton on the little front porch of the\nold ladies' house, where we were taking our after-dinner smoke while\nMiss Martha and Miss Maria were washing, with their own white hands,\nthe china and glass in which they took so much pride.  I often used to\ngo over and spend an hour with Pepton.  He liked to have some one to\nwhom he could talk on the subjects which filled his soul, and I liked\nto hear him talk.\n\n\"I tell you,\" said he, as he leaned back in his chair, with his feet\ncarefully disposed on the railing so that they would not injure Miss\nMaria's Madeira-vine, \"I tell you, sir, that there are two things I\ncrave with all my power of craving--two goals I fain would reach, two\ndiadems I would wear upon my brow.  One of these is to kill an\neagle--or some large bird--with a shaft from my good bow.  I would then\nhave it stuffed and mounted, with the very arrow that killed it still\nsticking in its breast.  This trophy of my skill I would have fastened\nagainst the wall of my room or my hall, and I would feel proud to think\nthat my grandchildren could point to that bird--which I would carefully\nbequeath to my descendants--and say, `My grand'ther shot that bird, and\nwith that very arrow.'  Would it not stir your pulses if you could do a\nthing like that?\"\n\n\"I should have to stir them up a good deal before I could do it,\" I\nreplied.  \"It would be a hard thing to shoot an eagle with an arrow.\nIf you want a stuffed bird to bequeath, you'd better use a rifle.\"\n\n\"A rifle!\" exclaimed Pepton.  \"There would be no glory in that.  There\nare lots of birds shot with rifles--eagles, hawks, wild geese,\ntomtits--\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" I interrupted, \"not tomtits.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps they are too little for a rifle,\" said he. \"But what I\nmean to say is that I wouldn't care at all for an eagle I had shot with\na rifle.  You couldn't show the ball that killed him.  If it were put\nin properly, it would be inside, where it couldn't be seen.  No, sir.\nIt is ever so much more honorable, and far more difficult, too, to hit\nan eagle than to hit a target.\"\n\n\"That is very true,\" I answered, \"especially in these days, when there\nare so few eagles and so many targets.  But what is your other diadem?\"\n\n\"That,\" said Pepton, \"is to see Miss Rosa wear the badge.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said I.  And from that moment I began to understand Pepton's\nhopes in regard to the grandmother of those children who should point\nto the eagle.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he continued, \"I should be truly happy to see her win the\nbadge.  And she ought to win it.  No one shoots more correctly, and\nwith a better understanding of all the rules, than she does.  There\nmust truly be something the matter with her aiming.  I've half a mind\nto coach her a little.\"\n\nI turned aside to see who was coming down the road.  I would not have\nhad him know I smiled.\n\nThe most objectionable person in our club was O. J.  Hollingsworth.  He\nwas a good enough fellow in himself, but it was as an archer that we\nobjected to him.\n\nThere was, so far as I know, scarcely a rule of archery that he did not\nhabitually violate.  Our president and nearly all of us remonstrated\nwith him, and Pepton even went to see him on the subject, but it was\nall to no purpose.  With a quiet disregard of other people's ideas\nabout bow-shooting and other people's opinions about himself, he\npersevered in a style of shooting which appeared absolutely absurd to\nany one who knew anything of the rules and methods of archery.\n\nI used to like to look at him when his turn came around to shoot.  He\nwas not such a pleasing object of vision as Miss Rosa, but his style\nwas so entirely novel to me that it was interesting.  He held the bow\nhorizontally, instead of perpendicularly, like other archers, and he\nheld it well down--about opposite his waistband.  He did not draw his\narrow back to his ear, but he drew it back to the lower button of his\nvest.  Instead of standing upright, with his left side to the target,\nhe faced it full, and leaned forward over his arrow, in an attitude\nwhich reminded me of a Roman soldier about to fall upon his sword.\nWhen he had seized the nock of his arrow between his finger and thumb,\nhe languidly glanced at the target, raised his bow a little, and let\nfly.  The provoking thing about it was that he nearly always hit.  If\nhe had only known how to stand, and hold his bow, and draw back his\narrow, he would have been a very good archer.  But, as it was, we could\nnot help laughing at him, although our president always discountenanced\nanything of the kind.\n\nOur champion was a tall man, very cool and steady, who went to work at\narchery exactly as if he were paid a salary, and intended to earn his\nmoney honestly.  He did the best he could in every way.  He generally\nshot with one of the bows owned by the club, but if any one on the\nground had a better one, he would borrow it.  He used to shoot\nsometimes with Pepton's bow, which he declared to be a most capital\none.  But as Pepton was always very nervous when he saw his bow in the\nhands of another than himself, the champion soon ceased to borrow it.\n\nThere were two badges, one of green silk and gold for the ladies, and\none of green and red for the gentlemen, and these were shot for at each\nweekly meeting.  With the exception of a few times when the club was\nfirst formed, the champion had always worn the gentlemen's badge.  Many\nof us tried hard to win it from him, but we never could succeed; he\nshot too well.\n\nOn the morning of one of our meeting days, the champion told me, as I\nwas going to the city with him, that he would not be able to return at\nhis usual hour that afternoon.  He would be very busy, and would have\nto wait for the six-fifteen train, which would bring him home too late\nfor the archery meeting.  So he gave me the badge, asking me to hand it\nto the president, that he might bestow it on the successful competitor\nthat afternoon.\n\nWe were all rather glad that the champion was obliged to be absent.\nHere was a chance for some one of us to win the badge.  It was not,\nindeed, an opportunity for us to win a great deal of honor, for if the\nchampion were to be there we should have no chance at all.  But we were\nsatisfied with this much, having no reason--in the present, at\nleast--to expect anything more.\n\nSo we went to the targets with a new zeal, and most of us shot better\nthan we had ever shot before.  In this number was O. J. Hollingsworth.\nHe excelled himself, and, what was worse, he excelled all the rest of\nus.  He actually made a score of eighty-five in twenty-four shots,\nwhich at that time was remarkably good shooting, for our club.  This\nwas dreadful!  To have a fellow who didn't know how to shoot beat us\nall was too bad.  If any visitor who knew anything at all of archery\nshould see that the member who wore the champion's badge was a man who\nheld his bow as if he had the stomach-ache, it would ruin our character\nas a club.  It was not to be borne.\n\nPepton in particular felt greatly outraged.  We had met very promptly\nthat afternoon, and had finished our regular shooting much earlier than\nusual; and now a knot of us were gathered together, talking over this\nunfortunate occurrence.\n\n\"I don't intend to stand it,\" Pepton suddenly exclaimed.  \"I feel it as\na personal disgrace.  I'm going to have the champion here before dark.\nBy the rules, he has a right to shoot until the president declares it\nis too late.  Some of you fellows stay here, and I'll bring him.\"\n\nAnd away he ran, first giving me charge of his precious bow.  There was\nno need of his asking us to stay.  We were bound to see the fun out,\nand to fill up the time our president offered a special prize of a\nhandsome bouquet from his gardens, to be shot for by the ladies.\n\nPepton ran to the railroad station, and telegraphed to the champion.\nThis was his message:\n\n\n\"You are absolutely needed here.  If possible, take the five-thirty\ntrain for Ackford.  I will drive over for you.  Answer.\"\n\n\nThere was no train before the six-fifteen by which the champion could\ncome directly to our village; but Ackford, a small town about three\nmiles distant, was on another railroad, on which there were frequent\nafternoon trains.\n\nThe champion answered:\n\n\n\"All right.  Meet me.\"\n\n\nThen Pepton rushed to our livery stable, hired a horse and buggy, and\ndrove to Ackford.\n\nA little after half-past six, when several of us were beginning to\nthink that Pepton had failed in his plans, he drove rapidly into the\ngrounds, making a very short turn at the gate, and pulled up his\npanting horse just in time to avoid running over three ladies, who were\nseated on the grass.  The champion was by his side!\n\nThe latter lost no time in talking or salutations.  He knew what he had\nbeen brought there to do, and he immediately set about trying to do it.\nHe took Pepton's bow, which the latter urged upon him.  He stood up,\nstraight and firm on the line, at thirty-five yards from the\ngentlemen's target; he carefully selected his arrows, examining the\nfeathers and wiping away any bit of soil that might be adhering to the\npoints after some one had shot them into the turf; with vigorous arm he\ndrew each arrow to its head; he fixed his eyes and his whole mind on\nthe centre of the target; he shot his twenty-four arrows, handed to\nhim, one by one, by Pepton, and he made a score of ninety-one.\n\nThe whole club had been scoring the shots, as they were made, and when\nthe last arrow plumped into the red ring, a cheer arose from every\nmember excepting three: the champion, the president, and O. J.\nHollingsworth.  But Pepton cheered loudly enough to make up these\ndeficiencies.\n\n\"What in the mischief did they cheer him for?\" asked Hollingsworth of\nme.  \"They didn't cheer me when I beat everybody on the grounds an hour\nago.  And it's no new thing for him to win the badge; he does it every\ntime.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said I, frankly, \"I think the club, AS a club, objects to your\nwearing the badge, because you don't know how to shoot.\"\n\n\"Don't know how to shoot!\" he cried.  \"Why, I can hit the target better\nthan any of you.  Isn't that what you try to do when you shoot?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said I, \"of course that is what we try to do.  But we try to do\nit in the proper way.\"\n\n\"Proper grandmother!\" he exclaimed.  \"It doesn't seem to help you much.\nThe best thing you fellows can do is to learn to shoot my way, and then\nperhaps you may be able to hit oftener.\"\n\nWhen the champion had finished shooting he went home to his dinner, but\nmany of us stood about, talking over our great escape.\n\n\"I feel as if I had done that myself,\" said Pepton.  \"I am almost as\nproud as if I had shot--well, not an eagle, but a soaring lark.\"\n\n\"Why, that ought to make you prouder than the other,\" said I, \"for a\nlark, especially when it's soaring, must be a good deal harder to hit\nthan an eagle.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" said Pepton, reflectively.  \"But I'll stick to the lark.\nI'm proud.\"\n\nDuring the next month our style of archery improved very much, so much,\nindeed, that we increased our distance, for gentlemen, to forty yards,\nand that for ladies to thirty, and also had serious thoughts of\nchallenging the Ackford club to a match.  But as this was generally\nunderstood to be a crack club, we finally determined to defer our\nchallenge until the next season.\n\nWhen I say we improved, I do not mean all of us.  I do not mean Miss\nRosa.  Although her attitudes were as fine as ever, and every motion as\ntrue to rule as ever, she seldom made a hit.  Pepton actually did try\nto teach her how to aim, but the various methods of pointing the arrow\nwhich he suggested resulted in such wild shooting that the boys who\npicked up the arrows never dared to stick the points of their noses\nbeyond their boarded barricade during Miss Rosa's turns at the target.\nBut she was not discouraged, and Pepton often assured her that if she\nwould keep up a good heart, and practise regularly, she would get the\nbadge yet.  As a rule, Pepton was so honest and truthful that a little\nstatement of this kind, especially under the circumstances, might be\nforgiven him.\n\nOne day Pepton came to me and announced that he had made a discovery.\n\n\"It's about archery,\" he said, \"and I don't mind telling you, because I\nknow you will not go about telling everybody else, and also because I\nwant to see you succeed as an archer.\"\n\n \"I am very much obliged,\" I said, \"and what is the discovery?\"\n\n\"It's this,\" he answered.  \"When you draw your bow, bring the nock of\nyour arrow\"--he was always very particular about technical terms--\"well\nup to your ear.  Having done that, don't bother any more about your\nright hand.  It has nothing to do with the correct pointing of your\narrow, for it must be kept close to your right ear, just as if it were\nscrewed there.  Then with your left hand bring around the bow so that\nyour fist--with the arrow-head, which is resting on top of it--shall\npoint, as nearly as you can make it, directly at the centre of the\ntarget.  Then let fly, and ten to one you'll make a hit.  Now, what do\nyou think of that for a discovery?  I've thoroughly tested the plan,\nand it works splendidly.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said I, \"that you have discovered the way in which good\narchers shoot.  You have stated the correct method of managing a bow\nand arrow.\"\n\n\"Then you don't think it's an original method with me?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" I answered.\n\n\"But it's the correct way?\"\n\n\"There's no doubt of that,\" said I.\n\n\"Well,\" said Pepton, \"then I shall make it my way.\"\n\nHe did so, and the consequence was that one day, when the champion\nhappened to be away, Pepton won the badge.  When the result was\nannounced, we were all surprised, but none so much so as Pepton\nhimself.  He had been steadily improving since he had adopted a good\nstyle of shooting, but he had had no idea that he would that day be\nable to win the badge.\n\nWhen our president pinned the emblem of success upon the lapel of his\ncoat, Pepton turned pale, and then he flushed.  He thanked the\npresident, and was about to thank the ladies and gentlemen; but\nprobably recollecting that we had had nothing to do with it,--unless,\nindeed, we had shot badly on his behalf,--he refrained.  He said\nlittle, but I could see that he was very proud and very happy.  There\nwas but one drawback to his triumph:\n\nMiss Rosa was not there.  She was a very regular attendant, but for\nsome reason she was absent on this momentous afternoon.  I did not say\nanything to him on the subject, but I knew he felt this absence deeply.\n\nBut this cloud could not wholly overshadow his happiness.  He walked\nhome alone, his face beaming, his eyes sparkling, and his good bow\nunder his arm.\n\nThat evening I called on him, for I thought that when he had cooled\ndown a little he would like to talk over the affair.  But he was not\nin.  Miss Maria said that he had gone out as soon as he had finished\nhis dinner, which he had hurried through in a way which would certainly\ninjure his digestion if he kept up the practice; and dinner was late,\ntoo, for they waited for him, and the archery meeting lasted a long\ntime today; and it really was not right for him to stay out after the\ndew began to fall with only ordinary shoes on, for what's the good of\nknowing how to shoot a bow and arrow, if you're laid up in your bed\nwith rheumatism or disease of the lungs?  Good old lady!  She would\nhave kept Pepton in a green baize bag, had such a thing been possible.\n\nThe next morning, full two hours before church-time, Pepton called on\nme.  His face was still beaming.  I could not help smiling.\n\n\"Your happiness lasts well,\" I said.\n\n\"Lasts!\" he exclaimed.  \"Why shouldn't it last!\"\n\n\"There's no reason why it should not--at least, for a week,\" I said,\n\"and even longer, if you repeat your success.\"\n\nI did not feel so much like congratulating Pepton as I had on the\nprevious evening.  I thought he was making too much of his\nbadge-winning.\n\n\"Look here!\" said Pepton, seating himself, and drawing his chair close\nto me, \"you are shooting wild--very wild indeed.  You don't even see\nthe target.  Let me tell you something.  Last evening I went to see\nMiss Rosa.  She was delighted at my success.  I had not expected this.\nI thought she would be pleased, but not to such a degree.  Her\ncongratulations were so warm that they set me on fire.\"\n\n\"They must have been very warm indeed,\" I remarked.\n\n\"`Miss Rosa,' said I,\" continued Pepton, without regarding my\ninterruption, \"`it has been my fondest hope to see you wear the badge.'\n`But I never could get it, you know,' she said.  `You have got it,' I\nexclaimed.  `Take this.  I won it for you.  Make me happy by wearing\nit.'  `I can't do that,' she said.  `That is a gentleman's badge.'\n`Take it,' I cried, `gentleman and all!'\n\n \"I can't tell you all that happened after that,\" continued\nPepton.  \"You know, it wouldn't do.  It is enough to say that she wears\nthe badge.  And we are both her own--the badge and I!\"\n\nNow I congratulated him in good earnest.  There was a reason for it.\n\n\"I don't owe a snap now for shooting an eagle,\" said Pepton, springing\nto his feet and striding up and down the floor.  \"Let 'em all fly free\nfor me.  I have made the most glorious shot that man could make.  I\nhave hit the gold--hit it fair in the very centre!  And what's more,\nI've knocked it clean out of the target!  Nobody else can ever make\nsuch a shot.  The rest of you fellows will have to be content to hit\nthe red, the blue, the black, or the white.  The gold is mine!\"\n\nI called on the old ladies, some time after this, and found them alone.\nThey were generally alone in the evenings now.  We talked about\nPepton's engagement, and I found them resigned.  They were sorry to\nlose him, but they wanted him to be happy.\n\n\"We have always known,\" said Miss Martha, with a little sigh, \"that we\nmust die, and that he must get married.  But we don't intend to repine.\nThese things will come to people.\"  And her little sigh was followed by\na smile, still smaller.",
