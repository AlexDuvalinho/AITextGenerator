 "text": "\"Terminal Compromise\" by Winn Schwartau\n\nWho thanks you for your consideration.\n\n                    INTER.PACT Press\n                    11511 Pine St.\n                    Seminole, FL  34642\n\n     All contents are (C) 1991, 1992, 1993 Inter.Pact\n\n\n\n\n      THE WORLD'S FIRST NOVEL-ON-THE-NET (tm) SHAREWARE!!!\n                       By Inter.Pact Press\n\n                      \"TERMINAL COMPROMISE\"\n                        by Winn Schwartau\n\n     A high tech thriller that comes from today's headlines!\n\n\"The Tom Clancy of computer security.\"\n          Assoc. Prof. Dr. Karen Forcht, James Madison University\n\n\"Terminal  Compromise\" is a highly praised novel about the  inva-\nsion of the United States by computer terrorists.\n\nSince  it was first published in conventional print form,  (ISBN:\n0-962-87000-5)  it has sold extremely well world-wide,  but  then\nagain,  it never hit the New York Times Bestseller  List  either.\nBut that's OK, not many do.\n\nRecently,  someone we know very well came up with a  real  bright\nidea.   They suggested  that INTER.PACT Press take  the  unprece-\ndented,  and maybe slightly crazy, step to put \"Terminal  Compro-\nmise\" on the Global Network thus creating a new category for book\npublishers.   The  idea is to offer  \"Terminal  Compromise,\"  and\nperhaps  other titles at NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE(tm) rates  to\nmillions  of people who just don't spend a lot of time  in  book-\nstores.   After  discussions with dozens of people -  maybe  even\nmore than a hundred - we decided to do just that.   We know  that\nwe're  taking a chance, but we've been convinced by  hackers  and\nphreakers and corporate types and government representatives that\nputting \"Terminal Compromise\" on the net would be a fabulous step\nforward  into  the Electronic Age, (Cyberspace if you  will)  and\nwould encourage other publishers to take advantage of  electronic\ndistribution.   (It's still in the bookstores, though.)\n\nTo  the  best of our  knowledge,  no  semi-sorta-kinda-legitimate\n-publisher has ever put a complete pre-published 562 page book on\nthe  network  as a form of Shareware.  So, I guess  we're  making\nnews  as  well as providing a service to the  world's  electronic\ncommunity.   The recommended NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE fees  are\noutlined later (this is how we stay in business), so please  read\non.\n\nWE KEEP THE COPYRIGHTS!\n\n\"Terminal  Compromise\"  is  NOT  being  entered  into  the  public\ndomain.   It  is  being  distributed  electronically  so  hundreds\nof thousands more  people  can enjoy it and  understand just where\nwe are heading with  our  omnipresent  interconnectedness  and the\npotential dangers we face.  INTER.PACT Press  maintains  all copy-\nrights to \"Terminal Compromise\" and does not, either intentionally\nor  otherwise,  explicitly  or implicitly,  waive  any  rights  to\nthis  piece  of  work or  recourses  deemed  appropriate.

Homosoto  promises\nrevenge  against the United States before he dies.  His  passion-\nate, almost obsessive hatred of everything American finally comes\nto a head when he acts upon his desires.\n\nWith  unlimited resources, he comes up with the ultimate  way  to\nstrike back at the enemy. Miles  Foster, a brilliant 33 year old\nmathematician   apparently isn't  exactly  fond of America either.\nThe  National  Security  Agency wanted  his  skills, but his back-\nground and \"family\" connections kept him from advancing within the\nintelligence  community.  His  insatiable - borderline psychotic-\nsex drive  balances  the intensity  of waging war against his own\ncountry to  the  highest bidder.\n\nScott  Mason,  made  his fortune selling high tech  toys  to  the\nPentagon.   Now as a New York City Times reporter,  Mason  under-\nstands  both  the good and the evil of technology  and  discovers\npieces  of  the terrible plot which is designed  to  destroy  the\neconomy of the United States.\n\nTyrone  Duncan, a physically huge 50-ish black senior  FBI  agent\nwho suffered through the Hoover Age indignities, befriends  Scott\nMason.  Tyrone provides the inside government track and confusion\nfrom competing agencies to deal with the threats.  His altruistic\nand  somewhat pure innate view of the world finally makes him  do\nthe right thing.\n\nAs  Homosoto's  plan evolves, Arab zealots,  German  intelligence\nagents and a host of technical mercenaries find the weaknesses in\nour  techno-economic  infrastructure.   Victims  find  themselves\nunder  attack by unseen adversaries; Wall Street suffers  debili-\ntating  blows; Ford and Chrysler endure massive shut downs.   The\nU.S. economy suffers a series of crushing blows.\n\nFrom  the White House to the Pentagon to the CIA to the  National\nSecurity Agency and FBI, a complex weaving of fascinating politi-\ncal characters find themselves enmeshed a battle of the New World\nOrder.   Sex,  drugs, rock'n'roll: Tokyo,  Vienna,  Paris,  Iraq,\nIran.  It's all here.\n\nEnjoy reading \"Terminal Compromise.\"\n\n\n\n                     SHAREWARE - NOVEL FEES:\n\nWe hope that you enjoy \"Terminal Compromise\" as much as  everyone\nelse  has, and that you will send us a few shekels  according  to\nthe following guidelines.\n\nThe  NOVEL-ON-THE-NET SHAREWARE(tm)  fees for us as a  publishing\ncompany  are no different than the fees for software  application\nshareware publishers, and the intent is the same.

Maybe it doesn't matter and they're the  same\nafter all.  Other than a few well known names and incidents,  the\nevents in this book are fictional - to the best of my knowledge.\n\nAs  I wrote this tale, I was endlessly coming upon  new  methods,\nnew  tactics, new ways to wage computer warfare. I found that  if\nthis story was to be told, I had to accept the fact that it would\nalways be unfinished.  The battle of the computers is one without\nan end in sight.\n\nThis story is an attempt to merge the facts as they are with  the\npossibilities.   The  delineation  between fact  and  fiction  is\nclouded  because the fiction of yesterday is the fact, the  news,\nof  today.  I expect that distinction to become hazier  over  the\nnext few years.\n\nIt  is that incongruity that spawns a  conjectured  extrapolation\nindistinguishable from reality.\n\nThe  construction of the model that gave birth to this  tale  was\nthe culmination of many years of work, with a fictional narrative\nbeing  the last thing in my mind.  That was an accident  necessi-\ntated by a need to reach the largest possible audience.\n\nIn  fact, a lot of things have surprised me since \"Terminal  Com-\npromise\"  was  first published.  It seemed that we were  able  to\npredict a number of things including Polymorphics, Clipper Chips,\nnon-lethal  warfare . . . and you'll recognize a few other  prog-\nnostications we didn't expect to come to pass quite yet.\n\nThe reader will soon know why.\n\nThere  were many people who have been invaluable in the  prepara-\ntion  of  this  document, but I'll only mention a  few.   If  the\nreader  doesn't want to hear about my friends, please move on  to\nthe next chapter.\n\nMary C. Bell.  Hi, Mom.  Thanks for the flashlight.\n\nLazarus Cuttman.  The greatest editor a writer has ever had.   He\nkept me honest.\n\nMiles  Roban.  That's an alias.  He's the one who told  me  about\nthe real NSA.  I hope he doesn't get in trouble for what he said.\nI owe him a pound of M&Ms.  2 lbs. of them.  (NOTE: For over  two\nyears, according to 'high-up' sources, the NSA has been and still\nis  looking for 'Miles'.  They haven't found him yet, despite  an\nintensive internal NSA search.  We need more people like  'Miles'\nwho are willing to break down the conventional barriers of  secu-\nrity on issues that affect us all.)\n\nDad.  God rest.\n\nWinn Schwartau, July, 1993\n\n****************************************************************\n\n          \"Terminal Compromise\" is dedicated to:\n\nSherra\nThere is no adequate way to say thank you.

In all of his professional  political\nlife, not even his closest aids or his wife had ever seen him  so\ntotally  out  of character.  The placid  Southern  confidence  he\nnormally  exuded, part well designed media image, part real,  was\ncompletely shattered.\n\n\"Are  you  telling me that we spent almost $4  trillion  dollars,\nfour goddamn trillion dollars on defense, and we're not  prepared\nto  defend our computers?  You don't have a game plan?  What  the\nhell  have we been doing for the last 12 years?\"   The  President\nbellowed  as loudly as anyone could remember. No one in the  room\nanswered. The President  glared right through each of his  senior\naides.\n\n\"Damage Assessment Potential?\"  The President said abruptly as he\nforced a fork full of scrambled eggs into his mouth.\n\n\"The  Federal  Reserve and most Banking transactions  come  to  a\nvirtual standstill.  Airlines grounded save for emergency  opera-\ntions.    Telephone  communications  running at 30%  or  less  of\ncapacity.   No  Federal payments for weeks.  Do you  want  me  to\ncontinue?\"\n\n\"No, I get the picture.\"\n\nThe  President  wished to God he wouldn't be  remembered  as  the\nPresident who allowed the United States of America to slip  back-\nward 50 years.  He waited for the steam in his collar to  subside\nbefore saying anything he might regret.\n\n* * * * *\n\n  Monday, August 6, 1945.\n  Japan\n\nThe classroom was coming to order.  Shinzo Ito, the 12th graders'\ninstructor  was running a few minutes late and the students  were\nin a fervent discussion about the impending end to the war.   And\nof  course  it  was to be a Japanese victory  over  the  American\nMongrels.\n\nIto-san  was only 19 years old, and most of the senior class  was\nonly  a year or two younger than he. The war had deeply  affected\nall  of  them. The children of Japan were  well  acquainted  with\nsuffering and pain as families were wrenched apart - literally at\nthe seams, and expected to hold themselves together by the  honor\nthat their sacrifices represented.  They hardened, out of  neces-\nsity,  in order to survive and make it through the next day,  the\nnext week; and so they knew much about the war.  Since so many of\nthe men had gone to war, women and children ran the country.   10\nand 11 year old students from the schools worked as phone  opera-\ntors. It was an honorable cause, and everyone contributed; it was\nonly  fitting.  Their fathers and loved ones were fighting  self-\nlessly and winning the war.\n\nMany  of  the children's fathers had gone to war, valiantly,  and\nmany  had not come home.  Many came home in pieces, many  others,\nunrecognizable.  And when some fathers had gone off to war,  both\nthey and their families knew that would never return.  They  were\nmaking the Supreme Sacrifice for their country,  and more  impor-\ntantly, a contribution to their honorable way of life.\n\nThe sons and daughters of kamikazes were treated with near rever-\nence.   It  was  widely believed that their  father's  honor  was\nhanded down to their offspring as soon as word had been  received\nthe mission had been successful. Albeit a suicide mission.\n\nTaki Homosoto was one 17 year old boy so revered for his father's\nsacrifice.  Taki spoke confidently about such matters, about  the\nwar,  about American atrocities, and how Japan would soon  defeat\nthe round faced enemy.  Taki had understood, on his 17th birthday\nthat  his  father would leave . . .and assuredly die as  was  the\ngoal  of the kamikaze.  He pretended to understand that  it  made\nsense to him.\n\nIn the last 6 months since his father had left, Taki assumed,  at\nhis  father's  request,  the patriarchal role  in  the  immediate\nfamily.  The  personal  anguish  had  been  excruciating.   While\nfriends and family and officials praised Taki's father and  fami-\nly,  inside Taki did not accept that a man could willingly  leave\nhis family, his children, him . . .Taki, never to return.  Didn't\nhis father love him? Or his sister and brother?  Or his mother?\n\nTaki's  mother got a good job at one of the defense  plants  that\npermeated  Hiroshima, while Taki and his brother and sister  con-\ntinued  their schooling. But the praise, the respect didn't  make\nup for not having a father to talk to, to play with and to  study\nwith.  He loved his mother, but she wasn't a father.\n\nSo  Taki compensated and overcompensated and pretended  that  his\nfather's  sacrifice  was just, and good, and for  the  better  of\nsociety,  and  the war effort and his family.  Taki  spoke  as  a\njuvenile  expert on the war and the good of Japan and the bad  of\nthe  United  States and the filthy Americans  with  their  unholy\npractices  and  perverted  ways of life, and  how  they  tortured\nJapanese  prisoners.  Taki was an eloquent and convincing  orator\nto his piers and instructors alike.\n\nAt  8:15  A.M., the Hiroshima radio station, NHK,  rang  its  old\nschool  bell.   The bell was part of a warning  system  that  an-\nnounced impending attacks from the air, but it had been so  over-\nused  that it was mostly ignored.  The tolls from the  bell  were\nbarely  noticed  by the students or the teachers in  the  Honkawa\nSchool.   Taki  though,  looked out the window  toward  the  Aioi\nBridge. His ears perked and his eyes scanned the clear skies over\ndowntown  Hiroshima.   He was sure he heard something  .  .  .but\nno . . .\n\nThe  first sensation of motion in the steel  reinforced  building\ncame  long  seconds after the blinding light. Since  the  rolling\nearth  motions in 1923 devastated much of  Tokyo,  schoolchildren\nand  households nationwide practiced earthquake preparedness  and\nwere reasonably expectant of another major tremor at any time.\n\nBut  the combination of light from 10,000 suns and the  deafening\nroar  gave those who survived the blast reason to wish they  had-\nn't.   Blindness  was instant for those who saw the  sky  ignite.\nThe  classroom  was collapsing around them.  In the air  was  the\nnoise of a thousand trains at once...even louder.  In seconds the\nschoolhouse was in rubble.\n\nThe  United States  of American had just dropped the Atomic  Bomb\non Hiroshima, Japan.  This infamous event would soon be known  as\nayamachi -  the Great Mistake.\n\n* * * * *\n\n  Tuesday, August 7, 1945\n\nTaki  Homosoto opened his  eyes.   He knew he was laying  on  his\nback,  but  all else was a clutter of confusion.  He saw  a  dark\nceiling,  to what he didn't know and he hurt He turned  his  head\nand  saw  he was on a cot, maybe a bed, in a long  corridor  with\nmany  others  around him.   The room reeked of  human  waste  and\ndeath.\n\n\"Ah . . .you are awake.  It has been much time.\"  The voice  came\nfrom  behind  him.  He turned his head rapidly  and  realized  he\nshouldn't  have.  The pain speared him from his neck to the  base\nof  his spine.  Taki grimaced and made a feeble attempt at  whim-\npering.   He said nothing as he examined the figure in the  white\ncoat  who spoke again. \"You are a very lucky young man, not  many\nmade it.\"\n\nWhat was he talking about . . .made it?   Who?  His brain  wanted\nto speak but his mouth couldn't.  A slight gurgling noise ushered\nfrom  his  throat  but nothing else.  And the pain .  .  .it  was\neverywhere  at  once  . . .all over . . .he wanted  to  cry   for\nhelp  . . .but was unable.  The pain overtook Taki  Homosoto  and\nthe vision of the doctor blackened until there was no more.\n\nMuch later, Taki reawoke.   He assumed it was a long time  later,\nhe  been  awake  earlier  . . .or had that  been  a  dream.   The\ndoctor...no   he was in school and the earthquake . .  .yes,  the\nearthquake  .  . .why don't I remember?  I was knocked  out.   Of\ncourse.  As his eyes adjusted to the room, he saw and  remembered\nthat it wasn't a dream.  He saw the other cots, so many  of them,\nstretching in every direction amidst the cries of pain and  sighs\nof death.\n\nTaki  tried to cry out to a figure walking nearby but only a  low\npitched   moan   ushered  forth.   Then  he   noticed   something\nodd  .  .  .and  odd smell.  One he  didn't  recognize.   It  was\nfoul  . . .the stench of burned . . .burned what?  The odor  made\nhim sick and he tried to breathe through his mouth but the  awful\nodor  still  penetrated his glands.  Taki knew that he  was  very\nhurt and very sick and so were a lot of others.  It took him some\ntime,  and a lot of energy just to clear his thoughts.   Thinking\nhurt  -  it concentrated the aching in his head, but  the  effort\ntook  away  some of his other pain, or at least  it  successfully\ndistracted him focussing on it.\n\nThere  were  cries from all around.  Many  were  incomprehensible\nbabblings, obviously in agony.  Screams of \"Eraiyo!\", (\"the  pain\nis  unbearable!\") were constant.  Others begged to be put out  of\ntheir  misery.   Taki actually felt fortunate; he  couldn't  have\nscreamed if he had wanted to, but out of guilt he no longer  felt\nthe need to.\n\nFinally,  the same doctor, was it the same doctor? appeared  over\nhis  bed again.  \"I hope you'll stay with us for a few  minutes?\"\nThe  doctor  smiled.  Taki responded as best he  could.   With  a\ngrunt and the raising and lowering his eyelids.  \"Let me just say\nthat  you  are in very good condition . . .much better  than  the\nothers,\"  the doctor gestured across the room.  \"I don't mean  to\nsound cruel, but, we do need your bed, for those seriously hurt.\"\nThe doctor sounded truly distraught.  What had happened?\n\nA  terrified  look crossed Taki's face that ceded into  a  facial\nplead.    His   look   said,  \"I  can't  speak   so   answer   my\nquestions  .  . .you must know what they are. Where  am  I?  What\nhappened? Where is my class?\"\n\n\"I  understand  your name is Taki Homosoto?\"  the  doctor  asked.\n\"Your school identification papers . . .\"\n\nTaki blinked an affirmative as he tried to cough out a response.\n\n\"There is no easy way to tell this.  We must all be brave. Ameri-\nca  has used a terrible weapon upon the people of Japan.  A  spe-\ncial  new  bomb so terrible that Hiroshima is no  longer  even  a\nshadow of itself. A weapon where the sky turns to fire and build-\nings and our people melt . . .where the water sickens the  living\nand  those  who seem well drop in their steps from  an  invisible\nenemy. Almost half of the people of Hiroshima are dead or  dying.\nAs I said, you are a lucky one.\"\n\nTaki helped over the next days at the Communications Hospital  in\nwhat  was left of downtown Hiroshima.  When he wasn't tending  to\nthe dying, he moved the dead to the exits so the bodies could  be\ncremated, the one way  to insure eternal salvation.  The city got\nmuch of its light from pyres for weeks after the blasts.\n\nHe  helped distribute the kanpan and cold rice balls to the  very\nfew doctors and to survivors who were able to eat.  He walked the\nstreets  of Hiroshima looking for food, supplies,  anything  that\ncould help.  Walking through the rubble of what once was Hiroshi-\nma  fueled  his  hate and his loathing for  Americans.  They  had\nwrought  this  suffering by using their  pikadon,  or  flash-boom\nweapon, on civilians, women and children. He saw death, terrible,\nugly death, everywhere; from Hijiyama Hill to the bridges a cross\nthe wide Motoyas River.\n\nThe  Aioi  bridge spontaneously became an  impromptu  symbol  for\nvengeance  against the Americans.  Taki crossed the  remnants  of\nthe old stone bridge, which was to be the hypocenter of the blast\nif  the Enola Gay hadn't missed its target by 800 feet.   A  tall\nblond  man  in an American military uniform was tied to  a  stone\npost.   He  was an American POW, one of 23 in  Hiroshima.  A  few\ndozen  people, women in bloodstained kimonos and mompei and  near\nnaked  children  were hurling rocks and insults at  the  lifeless\nbody.  How appropriate thought Taki.  He found himself mindlessly\njoining in.  He threw rocks at the head, the body, the legs.   He\nthrew rocks and yelled.  He threw rocks and yelled at the remains\nof the dead serviceman until his arms and lungs ached.\n\nAnother 50,000 Japanese died from the effects of radiation within\ndays  while Taki continued to heal physically.   On August 17,  9\ndays after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki and 2 days after Emper-\nor  Hirohito's broadcast announcing Japan's surrender, a  typhoon\nswamped  Hiroshima  and killed thousands more.  Taki  blamed  the\nAmericans for the typhoon, too.\n\nTaki was alone for the first time in his life.  His family  dead,\neven  his  little sister.  Taki Homosoto was now a  hibakusha,  a\nsurvivor  of Hiroshima, an embarrassing and dishonorable fact  he\nwould desperately try to conceal for the rest of his life.\n\n* * * * *\n\n  Forty Years Later . . .\n  January, 1985, Gaithersburg,  Maryland.\n\nA pristine layer of thick soft snow covered the sprawling  office\nand laboratory filled campus where the National Bureau of  Stand-\nards sets standards for the country.  The NBS establishes exactly\nwhat  the time is, to the nearest millionth of a millionth  of  a\nsecond.   They make sure that we weigh things to the accuracy  of\nthe weight of an individual atom.  The NBS is a veritable techno-\nlogical  benchmark  to  which everyone agrees, if  for  no  other\nreason than convenience.\n\nIt  was  the NBS's turn to host the  National  Computer  Security\nConference  where the Federal government was ostensibly  supposed\nto  interface  with  academia and the business  world.   At  this\nexclusive  symposium,  only two years before, the  Department  of\nDefense  introduced a set of guidelines which  detailed  security\nspecifications to be used by the Federal agencies and recommended\nfor the private sector.\n\nA very dry group of techno-wizards and techno-managers and  tech-\nno-bureaucrats  assemble for several days, twice a year, to  dis-\ncuss  the latest developments in biometric identifications  tech-\nniques, neural based cryptographic analysis, exponential  factor-\ning  in  public key management, the subtleties  of  discretionary\naccess control and formalization of verification models.\n\nThe National Computer Security Center is a Department of  Defense\nworking group substantially managed by the super secret  National\nSecurity  Agency.   The NCSC's charter in life  is  to  establish\nstandards and procedures for securing the US Government's comput-\ners from compromise.\n\n1985's high point was an award banquet with slightly ribald\nspeeches.  Otherwise the conference was essentially a maze of\nhighly complex presentations, meaningless to anyone not well\nversed  in computers, security and government-speak.  An  attend-\nee's competence could be well gauged by his use of acronyms.  \"If\nthe  IRS  had DAC across its X.25 gateways,  it  could  integrate\nX9.17  management,  DES, MAC and X9.9 could be  used  throughout.\nSave the government a bunch!\"  \"Yeah, but the DoD had an RFI  for\nan RFQ that became a RFP, specced by NSA and based upon TD-80-81.\nIt  was  isolated, environmentally  speaking.\"   Boring,  thought\nMiles  Foster.   Incredibly boring, but it was his  job  to  sit,\nlisten and learn.\n\nMiles  Foster was a security and communications analyst with  the\nNational Security Agency at Fort Meade, Maryland.  It was part of\nthe regimen to attend such functions to stay on top of the latest\ndevelopments from elsewhere in the government and from university\nand private research programs.\n\nOut  of the 30 or so panels that Miles Foster had to attend,  pro\nforma, only one held any real interest for him.  It was a  mathe-\nmatical  presentation entitled, \"Propagation Tendencies  in  Self\nReplicating  Software\".   It was the one subject title  from  the\nconference guide about which he knew nothing.  He tried to figure\nout  what the talk was going to be about, but the answer  escaped\nhim until he heard what Dr. Les Brown had to say.\n\nMiles Foster wrote an encapsulated report of Dr. Brown's  presen-\ntation with the 23 other synopses he was required to generate for\nthe NSA.  Proof of Attendance.\n\nSUBJECT:\nDr. Les Brown - Professor of Computer Science, Sheffield  Univer-\nsity.  Dr. Brown presented an updated version of his PhD thesis.\n\nCONTENTS:\nDr. Brown spoke about unique characteristics of certain  software\nthat  can  be written to be self-replicating.   He  examined  the\nproperties of software code in terms of set theory and adequately\ndemonstrated  that software can be written with the sole  purpose\nof  disguising  its  true intents, and then  replicate  or  clone\nitself throughout a computer system without the knowledge of  the\ncomputer's operators.\n\nHe  further described classes of software that, if  designed  for\nspecific  purposes, would have undetectable characteristics.   In\nthe  self replicating class, some would have  crystalline  behav-\niors,  others  mutating behaviors, and others  random  behaviors.\nThe set theory presentations closely paralleled biological trans-\nmission characteristics and similar problems with disease  detec-\ntion and immunization.\n\nIt  became quite clear from the Dr. Brown's talk, that  surrepti-\ntiously  placed software with self-replicating  properties  could\nhave deleterious effects on the target computing system.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIt appears prudent to further examine this class of software  and\nthe  ramifications  of its use.  Dr. Brown  presented  convincing\nevidence  that such propagative effects can bypass existing  pro-\ntective  mechanisms  in sensitive data  processing  environments.\nThere  is indeed reason to believe that software of  this  nature\nmight  have  certain offensive military applications.  Dr.  Brown\nused the term 'Virus' to describe such classes of software.\n\nSigned, Miles Foster\nSenior Analyst\nY-Group/SF6-143G-1\n\nAfter he completed his observations of the conference as a whole,\nand the seminars in particular, Miles Foster decided to eliminate\nDr. Brown's findings from the final submission to his  superiors.\nHe wasn't sure why he left it out, it just seemed like the  right\nthing to do.\n\n****************************************************************\n\n\n                            Chapter 1\n     August, 4 Years Ago.\n     National Security Agency\n     Fort George S. Meade, Maryland.\n\nThousands  of  disk drives spun rapidly, at over 3600  rpm.   The\nmassive  computer  room, Computer Room C-12, gently  whirred  and\ndroned with a life of its own.  The sublime, light blue walls and\nspecially fitted blue tint light bulbs added a calming  influence\nto  the  constant urgency that drove the computer  operators  who\npushed  buttons, changed tapes and stared at the dozens of  amber\nscreens on the computers.\n\nRacks  upon  racks of foreboding electronic  equipment  rung  the\nwalls of Room C-12 with arrays of tape drives interspersed.  Rats\nnests  of wire and cable crept along the floor and in and out  of\nthe  control centers for the hundreds of millions of  dollars  of\nthe  most sophisticated computers in the world.  Only five  years\nago,  computing  power of this magnitude, now fit in a  room  the\nsize of an average house would have filled the Pentagon.  All  of\nthis, all of this power, for one man.\n\nMiles Foster was locked in a room without windows. It contained a\ntable,  4 chairs, and he was sure a couple of cameras and  micro-\nphones.  He had been held for a least six hours, maybe more; they\nhad taken his watch to distort his time perception.\n\nWithin 2 minutes of the time Miles Foster announced his  resigna-\ntions  as  a  communications expert with  the  National  Security\nAgency,  S Group, his office was sealed and guarded by  an  armed\nmarine.  His computer was disconnected, and he was escorted to  a\ndebriefing  room  where he had  sporadically  answered  questions\nasked by several different Internal Affairs Security Officers.\n\nWhile  Miles Foster was under virtual house arrest, not the  pre-\nferred term, but an accurate one, the Agency went to work.   From\nC-12,  a  group of IAS officers began to  accumulate  information\nabout  Miles Foster from a vast array of computer  memory  banks.\nThey  could dial up any major computer system within  the  United\nStates, and most around the world.  The  purpose, ostensibly,  of\nhaving  such  power  was to centralize and  make  more  efficient\nsecurity checks on government employees, defense contractors  and\nothers who might have an impact on the country's national securi-\nty.  But, it had other purposes, too.\n\nComputer  Room  C-12 is classified above Top  Secret,  it's  very\nexistence  denied by the NSA, the National Security  Agency,  and\nunknown to all but a very few of the nation's top policy  makers.\nCongress  knows  nothing of it and the President  was  only  told\nafter  it  had been completed, black funded by  a  non-line  item\naccountable   budget.   Computer  Room C-12 is one  of  only  two\nelectronic doors into the National Data Base - a digital  reposi-\ntory  containing the sum total knowledge and working profiles  of\nevery  man,  woman  and child in the United  States.   The  other\nsecret  door  that guards America's privacy is  deep  within  the\nbowels of the Pentagon.\n\nFrom  C-12,  IAS  accessed every bank record in  the  country  in\nMiles'  name, social security number or in that of his  immediate\nfamily.   Savings,  checking, CD's.  They had  printouts,  within\nseconds, of all of their last year's credit card activity.   They\npulled 3 years tax records from the IRS, medical records from the\nNational  Medical Data Base which connects hospitals  nationwide,\ntravel  records  from American carriers,  customs  checks,  video\nrental history, telephone records, stock purchases. Anything that\nany  computer  ever knew about Miles Foster was printed  and  put\ninto eleven 6\" thick files within 2 hours of the request from the\nDIRNSA, Director, National Security Agency.\n\nInternal Affairs was looking for some clue as to why a successful\nand  highly talented analyst like Miles Foster would so  abruptly\nresign  a  senior analyst position.  While Miles  was  more  than\nwilling  to tell them his feelings, and the real  reasons  behind\nhis  resignation, they wanted to make sure that there  weren't  a\nfew  little details he wasn't telling them.  Like,  perhaps  gam-\nbling  debts, women on the side, (he was single) or women on  the\nwrong side, overextended financial obligations, anything unusual.\nHad  he suddenly come into money and if he did, where did he  get\nit?  Blackmail was considered a very real possibility when  unex-\npected personnel changes occur.\n\nThe files vindicated Miles Foster of any obvious financial anoma-\nlies. Not that he knew he needed vindication.  He owned a Potomac\ncondominium in D.C., a 20 minutes against traffic commute to Fort\nMeade  where he had worked for years, almost his  entire  profes-\nsional life.  He traveled some, Caribbean cruises, nothing osten-\ntatious but in style, had a reasonable savings account, only used\n2 credit cards and he owed no one anything significant. There was\nnothing  unusual  about his file at all, unless  you  think  that\nliving  within ones means is odd.  Miles Foster knew how to  make\nthe most out of a dollar.  Miles Foster was clean.\n\nThe  walls  of his drab 12 foot square prison room were  a  dirty\nshade  of government gray.  There was an old map on the wall  and\nMiles  noticed  that the gray paint behind the it  was  7  shades\nlighter  than the surrounding paint. Two of the four  fluorescent\nbulbs were out, hiding some of the peeling paint on the  ceiling.\nAgainst one wall was a row of file cabinets with large iron  bars\nbehind  the  drawer handles, insuring that no one,  no  one,  was\ngetting into those file with permission.  Also prominent on  each\nfile cabinet was a tissue box sized padlock.\n\nMiles was alone, again.  When the IAS people questioned him, they\nwere  hard on him. Very hard. But most of the time he was  alone.\nMiles  paced the room during the prolonged waits. He  poked  here\nand there, under this, over that; he found the clean paint behind\nthe map and smirked.\n\nWhen the IAS men returned, they found Miles stretching and  exer-\ncising his svelte 5' 9\" physique to help relieve the boredom.\n\nHe  was 165 lbs. and in excellent for almost 40.  Miles wasn't  a\nfitness  nut,  but he enjoyed the results of staying in  shape  -\nwomen,  lots  of women.  He had a  lightly  tanned  Mediterranean\nskin, dark, almost black wavy hair on the longish side but immac-\nulately styled. His demeanor dripped elegance, even when he  wore\ntorn jeans, and he knew it.  It was merely another personal asset\nthat Miles had learned how to use to his best advantage.    Miles\nwas  regularly  proofed. He had a face that would permit  him  to\nassume any age from 20 to 40, but given his borderline arrogance,\nhe  called it aloofness, most considered him the younger.   None-\ntheless, women, of all ages went for it.\n\nOne peculiar trait made women and girls find Miles  irresistible.\nHe had an eerie but conscious muscular control over his  dimples.\nIf he were angry, a frown could mean any number of things depend-\ning  upon how he twitched his dimples.  A frown could mean,  \"I'm\nreal  angry, seriously\", or \"I'm just giving you shit\", or   \"You\nbore me, go away\", or more to Miles' purpose, \"You're gorgeous, I\nwanna  fuck  your brains out\".   His dimples could  pout  with  a\nsmile, grin with a sneer, emphasize a question; they could accent\nand augment his mood at will.\n\nBut now. he was severely bored.  Getting even more disgusted with\nthe  entire process.  The IAS wasn't going to find  anything.  He\nhad made sure of that.  After all, he was the computer expert.\n\nMiles heard the sole door to the room unlock.  It was a heavy, 'I\ndoubt  an ax could even get through this' door.  The  fourth  IAS\nman  to question Miles entered the room as the door was  relocked\nfrom the other side.\n\n\"So,  tell  us again, why did you quit?\"  The  IAS  man  abruptly\nblurted  out even before sitting in one of the old, World War  II\nvintage chairs by the wooden table.\n\n\"I've told you a hundred times and you have it on tape a  hundred\ntimes.\"   The disgust in his voice was obvious and intended.   \"I\nreally don't want to go through it again.\"\n\n\"Tough shit.  I want to hear it.  You haven't told me yet.\"  This\nguy was tougher, Miles thought.\n\n\"What  are you looking for?  For God's sake, what do you want  me\nto say?  You want a lie that you like better?  Tell me what it is\nand  I'll give it back to you, word for word.  Is that  what  you\nwant?\"   Miles  gave away something.  He showed, for  the   first\ntime,  real anger.  The intellect in Miles saw what  the  emotion\nwas  doing,  so his brain quickly secreted a  complex  string  of\namino  acids to call him down.  Miles decided that he  should  go\nback to the naive, 'what did I do?' image and stick to the plan.\n\nHe put his head in his hands and leaned forward for a second.  He\ngently  shook  and looked up sideways.  He was  very  convincing.\nThe IAS man thought that Miles might be weakening.\n\n\"I want the fucking truth,\" the IAS man bellowed.  \"And I want it\nnow!\"\n\nMiles  sighed.   He was tired and wanted a cigarette  so  bad  he\ncould shit, and that pleasure, too, he was being denied.  But  he\nhad prepared himself for this eventuality; serious interrogation.\n\n\"O.K.,  O.K.\" Miles feigned resignation.  He paused  for  another\nheavy  sigh.  \"I quit 'cause I got sick of the  shit.   Pure  and\nsimple.   I like my work, I don't like the bureaucracy that  goes\nwith  it.  That's it.  After over 10 years here, I expected  some\nsort  of  recognition other than a cost of living  increase  like\nevery other G12.  I want to go private where I'll be appreciated.\nMaybe even make some money.\"\n\nThe  IAS man didn't look convinced. \"What single event  made  you\nquit?  Why  this morning, and not yesterday or tomorrow,  or  the\nnext  day, or next week.  Why today?\"  The IAS man blew smoke  at\nMiles to annoy him and exaggerate the withdrawal symptoms.  Miles\nwas exhausted and edgy.\n\n\"Like I said, I got back another  'don't call us, we'll call you'\nresponse  on my Public-Private key scheme.  They said,  'Not  yet\npractical'  and set it up for another review in 18 months.   That\nwas  it.  Finis! The end, the proverbial straw that  you've  been\nlooking for.  Is that what you want?\"  Miles tried desperately to\nminimize any display of arrogance as he looked at the IAS man.\n\n\"What do you hope to do in the private sector?  Most of your work\nis classified.\"  The IAS man remained cool and unflustered.\n\n\"Plenty of defense guys who do crypto and need a good comm guy. I\nthink  the military call it the revolving door.\"  Miles'  dimpled\nsmugness did not sit well with IAS.\n\n\"Yeah,  you'll  probably  go  to work for  your  wop  friends  in\nSicily.\" The IAS man sarcastically accused.\n\n\"Hey   - you already know about that!\"  That royally  pissed  off\nMiles.   He  didn't appreciate any dispersion  on  his  heritage.\n\"They're relatives, that's  it.  Holidays, food, turkey, ham, and\na  bunch  of  booze.   And besides,\"  Miles  paused  and  smiled,\n\"there's no such thing as the Mafia.\"\n\nBy  early evening they let him relieve himself and  then  finally\nleave  the Fort. He was given 15 minutes to collect his  personal\nitems,  under  guard, and then escorted to the front  gate.   All\nidentification  was removed and his files were  transferred  into\nthe  'Monitor'  section, where they would sit for  at  least  one\nyear. The IAS people had finally satisfied themselves that  Miles\nFoster was a dissatisfied, underpaid government employee who  had\nhad enough of the immobility and rigidity of a giant bureaucratic\nmachine  that moves at a snails pace. Miles smiled at the end  of\nthe  interrogation.   Just like I said, he thought, just  like  I\nsaid.\n\nThere was no record in his psychological profiles, those from the\nAgency  shrinks, that suggested  Miles meant anything other  than\nwhat he claimed.  Let him go, they said.  Let him go.  Nowhere in\nthe  records  did it show how much he hated  his  stupid,  stupid\nbosses,  the bungling bureaucratic behemoths who didn't have  the\nfirst  idea  of  what he and his type did.   Nowhere  did  Miles'\nfrustration  and resultant build up of resentment and anger  show\nup  in  any file or on any chart or graph.   His  strong,  almost\noverbearing ego and over developed sense of worth and  importance\nwere  relegated  to  a personality quirk  common  to  superbright\nambitious engineering types.  It fit the profile.\n\nNowhere,  either,  was it mentioned that in years at  NSA,  Miles\nFoster had submitted over 30 unsolicited proposals for changes in\ncryptographic and communications techniques to improve the  secu-\nrity  of  the United States.  Nowhere did it say, they  were  all\nturned down, tabled, ignored.\n\nAt  one  point or another, Miles had to snap.  The  rejection  of\nproposal  number  thirty-four gave Miles the  perfect  reason  to\nquit.\n\n* * * * *\n\nMiles Foster looked 100% Italian despite the fact his father  was\na  pure Irishman.  \"Stupido, stupido\" his grandmother  would  say\nwhile  slamming the palm of her hand into forehead.  She was  not\nexactly fond of her daughter marrying outside family. But, it was\na good marriage, 3 great kids, or as good as kids get and  Grand-\nmama  tolerated  the relationship. Miles the oldest, was  only  7\nwhen  his father got killed as a bystander at a supermarket  rob-\nbery.\n\nMario  Dante, his homosexual uncle who worked in some  undefined,\nnever mentioned  capacity for a Vegas casino, assumed the  pater-\nnal role in raising Miles.  With 2 sisters, a mother, an aunt and\na  grandmother  all living under the same  roof with  Miles,  any\nmale  companionship,  role  model if you  will,  was  acceptable.\nMario  kept  the Family Honor, keeping  his  sexual  proclivities\nsecret  until  Miles turned 18.  Upon hearing,  Miles  commented,\n\"Yeah, so?  Everyone knows Uncle Mario's a fag.  Big deal.\"\n\nMario  was  a  big important guy, and he  did  business,  grownup\nbusiness.   That was all Miles was supposed to know.  When  Miles\nwas 13, Mario thought it would be a good idea for him  to  become\na  man.   Only 60 miles from Las Vegas lived the  country's  only\nlegal  brothels.  Very convenient.  Miles  wasn't going  to  fool\naround with any of that street  garbage.  Convention girls. Miles\nshould go first class the first time.\n\nPahrump, Nevada is home to the only legalized prostitution in the\nUnited States.  Mario drove fast, Miles figured about 130mph,  in\nhis  Red Ferrari on Highway 10, heading West from  Vegas.   Mario\nwas  drinking  Glen Fetitch, neat, and he steered with  only  one\nhand, hardly looking at the road.\n\nThe  inevitable  occurred.  Gaining on them, was a  Nevada  State\nTrooper.   The flashing lights and siren reminded Mario  to  slow\ndown  and  pull over.   He grinned, sipped his  drink  and  Miles\nworried.   Speeding  was against the law.  So  was  drinking  and\ndriving. The police officer walked over to the driver side of the\nFerrari.  Uncle Mario lowered the window to let the officer  lean\ninto  the  car.   As the trooper bent over  to  look  inside  the\nflashy  low slung import, Mario pulled out a handgun  from  under\nthe seat and stuck it into the cop's face.\n\nMario started yelling. \"Listen asshole, I wasn't speeding. Was I?\nI don't want nothing to go on my insurance.  I gotta good driving\nrecord, y'know?\"  Mario was crazy! Miles had several strong urges\nto severely contract his sphincter muscles.\n\n\"No  sir, I wanted to give you a good citizenship  citation,  for\nyour contributions to the public good.\"  The cop laughed in Uncle\nMario's face.\n\n\"Good  to see you still gotta sensa'humor.\"  Uncle Mario  laughed\nand  put  the gun back in his shoulder  holster.   Miles  stared,\ndumbfounded, still squeezing his butt cheeks tight.\n\n\"Eh,  Paysan! Where you going so fired up? You know  the  limit's\n110?\"  They both guffawed.\n\n\"Here!\"  Mario pointed at Miles. \"'Bout time the kid took a  ride\naround  the world, y'know what I mean?\"  Miles wasn't sure   what\nhe meant, but he was sure it had to do with where he was going to\nlose his virginity.\n\n\"Sheeeee-it!  Uptown! Hey kid, ask for Michelle and take  2  from\nColumn B, then do it once for me!\"  Even though they weren't,  to\na 13 year male Italian virgin, Mario and the cop were making  fun\nof  him. \"I remember my first time.  It was in a pick  up  truck,\nout  in the desert.   Went for fucking ever!  Know what  I  mean?\nThe  cop winked at Miles who was humiliated.  To  Miles'  relief,\nMario  finally  gave the cop an envelope, while  being  teasingly\nreprimanded.   \"Hey, Mario, take it a little easy out here,  will\nyah? At least on my watch, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah, sure. No problem.  Ciao.\"\n\n\"Ciao.\"\n\nThey  were off again, doing over 100mph in seconds.  The rest  of\nthe  evening went as planned.  Miles thanked his uncle in  a  way\nthat brought tears to Mario's eyes.  Miles said, \"You know, Uncle\nMario.  When I grow up, I want to be just like you.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"He's  just a boy, Mario! How could you!\"  Miles' mother did  not\nreact favorably to the news of her son's manhood.  She was trying\nto  protect him from the influence of her relatives.   Miles  was\ngauged near genius with a pronounced aptitude for mathematics and\nshe didn't want his life to go to waste.\n\nHis mother had married outside of the family, the organized crime\nculture, the life one inherits so easily.  She loved her  family,\nknew  that  they  dealt in gambling, some  drugs,  an  occasional\nrough-up  of an opponent, but preferred to ignore it.   She  mar-\nried  a man she loved, not one picked for he, but had lost him  6\nyears before. They _could not_ have her son.\n\nHer  wishes  were respected, in the memory of Miles  father,  and\nalso because it wasn't worth having a crazed Sicilian woman rant-\ning  and raving all about. But Miles was delectable bait  to  the\nFamily.  His mathematical wizardry could assist greatly in gaming\noperations, figure the odds, new angles, keep the dollars in  the\nhouse's favor despite all advertising claims to the contrary.\n\nBut, there was respect and honor in their promise to his  mother.\nHands  off was the rule that came all the way from the  top.   He\nwas  protected. Miles was titillated with the attention,  but  he\nstill  listened to his mother. She came before all others.   With\nno  father,  she became a little of both,  and  despite  anyone's\nattempts, Miles knew about Mario.\n\nMiles  was  such a subject of adoration by his mother,  aunt  and\ngrandmother,  siblings aside, that Miles came to expect the  same\ntreatment from everyone, especially women.  They praised him  so,\nhe  always got top honors, the best grades, that he came  to  re-\nquire the attention and approval.\n\nLiving with 5 women and a gay uncle for 11 years had its  effect.\nMiles  was incredibly heterosexual. Not anti-gay at all,  not  at\nall. But he had absolutely no interest in men.  He adored  women,\nlargely  because of his mother.  He put women on  pedestals,  and\ntreated  them  like queens. Even on a beer budget    Miles  could\nconvince  his  lady that they were sailing  the  Caribbean  while\nbaking  in  the desert suburbs of Las  Vegas.   Women  succumbed,\nwillingly, to Miles' slightest advance.  He craved the  approval,\nand worked long and hard to perfect his technique.  Miles  Foster\nwas  soon an expert.  His mother never openly  disapproved  which\nMiles took as approval.\n\nBy the time Miles went off to college study advanced  mathematics\nand  get a degree, he had shattered half of the  teen-age  hearts\nwithin  50 miles of Vegas. Plus, the admiration from  his  female\nfamily  had allowed him to convince himself that he was going  to\nchange  the world.  He was the single most important person  that\ncould  have  an effect on civilization.  Invincible.  Can  do  no\nwrong.  Miles  was the end-all to be-all.  If Miles said  it,  it\nmust  be so, and he bought into the program.  What his mother  or\ngirl  friends  called self confidence others called  conceit  and\narrogance.  Even obnoxious.\n\nHis  third love, after his mother and himself,  was  mathematics.\nHe  believed in mathematics as the answer to every problem.   All\nquestions can be reduced to formulas and symbols.  Then, once you\nhave  them on a piece of paper, or in a computer . . .the  answer\nwill appear.\n\nHis  master thesis was on that very subject.  It was a  brilliant\nsoliloquy on the reducibility of any multi-dimensional  condition\nto a defined set of measured properties.  He postulated that  all\nphenomenon  was  discrete  in nature and  none  were  continuous.\nGiven  that  arguable position, he was able to develop a  set  of\nmathematical tools that would permit dissection of a problem into\nmuch smaller pieces.  Once in manageable sizes, the problem would\nbe worked out piece by piece until the pieces were reassembled as\nthe  answer.   It was a tool that had very definite uses  in  the\ngovernment.\n\nHe  was recruited by the Government in 1976.  They wanted him  to\nput his ingenious techniques to good use.  The National  Security\nAgency  painted  an  idyllic picture of the ultimate  job  for  a\nmathematician  - the biggest, fastest and best computers  in  the\nworld at your fingertips.  Always the newest and the best.  What-\never  you  need,  it'll be there.  And that's  a  promise.  Super\nsecret important work - oh how his mother would be proud.   Miles\naccepted,  but they never told him the complete truth.  Not  that\nthey lied, of course.  However, they never bothered to tell  him,\nthat  because of his family background, guilt by  association  if\nyou wish, his career would be severely limited.\n\nMiles  made  it to senior analyst, and his family was proud,  but\nhe  never told them that over 40% of the staff in his  area  were\nsenior  analysts.  It was a high tech desk job that required  his\nparticular skills as a mathematician. The NSA got from Miles what\nthey wanted; his mathematical tools modified to work for  govern-\nment  security  projects.  For a couple of years,  Miles  happily\ncomplied  - then he got itchy to work on other  projects.   After\nall, he had come up with the idea in the first place, it was time\nhe came up with another.  Time to move on.\n\nIn typical bureaucratic manner, the only way to get something new\ndone  is to write a proposal; enlist support and try to  push  it\nthrough committee.  Everyone made proposals. You not only  needed\na good idea for a good project, good enough to justify the use of\n8 billion dollars worth of computers, but you needed the  connec-\ntions  and assistance of others.  You scratch mine, I'll  scratch\nyours.\n\nDuring  his tenure at NSA, Miles attempted to  institute  various\nprograms,  procedures, new mathematical modes that might be  use-\nful.   While  technically his concepts were superior,  his  arro-\ngance,  his better-than-everyone, my shit doesn't stink  attitude\nproved to be an insurmountable political obstacle.  He was unable\nto ever garner much support for his proposals.  Thus, not one  of\nthem was ever taken seriously.  Which compounded the problem  and\nreinforced Miles' increasingly sour attitude towards his  employ-\ner.  However, with dimples in command, Miles successfully  masked\nhis disdain.  To all appearance he acceded to the demands of  the\njob,  but  off the job, Miles Foster was a  completely  different\nperson.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe  telephone warbled on the desk of the IAS  Department  Chief.\nThe digital readout on the phone told him that it was an internal\ncall, not from outside the building, but he didn't recognize  the\nnumber.\n\n\"Investigations,\"  The chief answered.\n\n\"This is Jacobs.  We're checking up on Foster.\"\n\n\"Yessir?\"  DIRNSA?  Calling here?\n\n\"Is he gone?\"\n\n\"Yessir.\"\n\n\"Anything?\"\n\n\"No sir.\"\n\n\"Good. Close the file.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Close it.  Forever.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     September, 4 Years Ago\n     Georgetown, Washington, D.C.\n\nMiles  Foster set up shop in Washington D.C. as a  communications\nsecurity  consultant.   He  and half of those  who  lived  within\ndriving distance of the Capitol were known as Beltway Bandits,  a\nsimultaneously  endearing  and self-deprecating  title  given  to\nthose  who make their living selling products or services to  the\nFederal Government.  Miles was ex-NSA and that was always impres-\nsive to potential clients.  He let it be known that his  services\nwould now be available to the private sector, at the going rates.\n\nAs  part  of  the revolving door, from  Government  to  industry,\nMiles' value would decrease with time, so he needed to get a  few\nclients  quickly.  The day you leave public service all  of  your\nknowledge  is  current,  and therefore  valuable,  especially  to\ncompanies  who want to sell widgets to the government.    As  the\ndays  and months wear on, new policies, new people, new  arrange-\nments  and  confederacies are in place.   Washington's  transient\nnature  is  probably no more evident than through  the  political\ncircle  where  everyone is aware of whom is talking to  whom  and\nabout  what.  This Miles knew, so he stuck out his  tentacles  to\nmaximize his salability.\n\nHe  restructured  his dating habits.  Normally Miles  would  date\nwomen  whom he knew he could fuck.  He kept track of  their  men-\nstrual  cycles to make sure they wouldn't waste his time.  If  he\nthought a particular female had extraordinary oral sex skills, he\nwould make sure to seduce when she had her period. Increased  the\nodds of good blow job.\n\nNow  though, Miles restricted his dating, temporarily,  to  those\nwho could help start his career in the private sector.  \"Fuck the\nsecretary to get to the boss!\" he bragged unabashedly.\n\nMiles dragged himself to many of the social functions that grease\nthe  wheels  of motion in Washington.   The  elaborate   affairs,\noften  at  the expense of government contractors  and  lobbyists,\nwere a highly visible, yet totally legal way to shmooze and booze\nwith the influentia in the nation's capital.  The better parties,\nthe  ones  for generals, for movers and for shakers,  for  digni-\ntaries  and  others of immediate importance, are  graced  with  a\ngenerous sprinkling of strikingly beautiful women.  They are paid\nfor  by  the hosts, for the pleasure of the  their  guests.   The\nWashington  culture  requires that such services  are  discreetly\nhandled.  Expense reports and billings of that  nature  therefore\ncite  French Caterers, C.T. Temps, Formal Rentals  and  countless\nother  harmless,  inoffensive  and  misleading  sounding  company\nnames.\n\nMissile  Defense Systems, Inc. held one of the better parties  in\nan elegant old 2 story brick Georgetown home.  The building was a\nformer  embassy, which had been discarded long ago by its  owners\nin  favor of a neo-modern structure on Reservoir Road. The  house\nwas  appointed with a strikingly southern ante-bellum flair,  but\ntastefully done, not overly decorated.  The furniture was modern,\ncomfortable, meant to be and used enjoyed, yet well suited to the\nclassic formality.\n\nThe hot September night was punctuated with an occasional breeze.\nThe breaths of relief from Washington's muggy, swamp-like  summer\nair  were  welcomed by those braving the heat  in  the  manicured\ngardens  outside,  rather than the refreshing luxury of  the  air\nconditioned indoors.\n\nIt  was  a  straight cocktail party, a stand-up  affair,  with  a\nhundred  or so Pentagon types attending. It began at  seven,  and\nunless tradition was broken, it  would be over by 10 as the  last\nof  the girls finds her way into a waiting black  limousine  with\nher partner for the night.  Straight politics, Miles thought.\n\n9:30  neared, and Miles felt he had accomplished most of what  he\nhad  set out to do  - meet people, sell himself, play  the  game,\ntalk  the line, do the schtick.   He hadn't, though, yet  figured\nout how he was going to get laid tonight.\n\nAs  he sipped his third Glen Fetitch on the rocks, he  spotted  a\nwoman  whom  he  hadn't seen that evening.  Maybe  she  had  just\narrived, maybe she was leftovers.  Well, it was getting late, and\nhe shouldn't let a woman go to waste, so let's see what she looks\nlike  from  the front.  She looked aimlessly through  the  French\ndoors at the backyard flora.\n\nMiles  sauntered  over to her and introduced himself.   \"Hi,  I'm\nMiles  Foster.\" He grinned wide, dimples in force, as she  turned\ntoward  him.  She was gorgeous.  Stunning even.   About  an  inch\ntaller  than Miles, she wore her shimmering auburn hair  shoulder\nlength.   Angelic,  he thought.  Perfectly formed full  lips  and\nstatuesque  cheek  bones underscored her  sweetly  intense  brown\neyes. Miles went to work, and by 10P.M., he and Stephanie Perkins\nwere on their way to Deja Vu on 22nd. and M Street for drinks and\ndance.   By 10:30 he had nicknamed her Perky because her  breasts\nstood  at constant attention. By 11:30 they were on their way  to\nMiles' apartment.\n\nAt 2:00 AM Miles was quite satisfied with himself. So was  Perky.\nHis  technique was perfect. Never a complaint.  Growing up  in  a\nhouseful without men taught Miles what women wanted.  He  learned\nhow to give it to them, just the way they liked it.  The  weekend\ntogether  was  heaven  in bed; playing,  making  love,  giggling,\nordering in Chinese and pizza. Playing more, watching I Love Lucy\nreruns,  drinking  champagne,  and making  love.   Miles  bounced\nquarters on her taut stomach and cracked eggs on her  exquisitely\ntight  derriere. By Sunday morning, Miles found that he  actually\nliked Stephanie.  It wasn't that he didn't like his other  women,\nhe  did.  It was just, well this one was different.  He  'really'\nliked her.  A very strange feeling for Miles Foster.\n\n\"Miles?\" Stephanie asked during another period of blissful after-\nglow.  She snuggled up against him closer.\n\n\"Yeah?\"  He responded by squeezing her buttocks.  His  eyes  were\nstill closed.\n\n\"In  a  minute  stud, yes.\" She looked up  reassuringly  at  him.\n\"Miles, would you work for anyone?\"  She kissed his chest.\n\n\"What  do you mean?\" he asked in return.  He wasn't in  the  mood\nfor shop talk.\n\n\"Like, say, a foreigner, not an American company.  Would you work\nfor them?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"  Miles looked down inquisitively. \"Foreigner? I guess  so.\nWhy do you ask?\"  He sounded a tad concerned.\n\n\"Oh, no reason.\" She rubbed him between his legs. \"Just  curious.\nI thought you were a consultant, and consultants work for  anyone\nwho can pay.  That's all.\"\n\n\"I am, and I will, but so what?\"  He relaxed as Stephanie's hands\ngot the desired result.\n\n\"Well,\"  she stroked him rhythmically. \"I know some  people  that\ncould  use you. They're not American, that's all.  I didn't  know\nif you cared.\"\n\n\"No, I don't care,\" he sighed.  \"It's all the same to me.  Unless\nthey're  commies.  My former employer would definitely  frown  on\nthat.\"\n\n\"Would  you  mind  if I called them, and maybe you  two  can  get\ntogether?\" She didn't miss a beat.\n\n\"No go ahead, call them, anything you want, but can we talk about\nthis later?\"  Miles begged.\n\n* * * * *\n\nMiles  felt  very  much uninformed on his way  to  the  Baltimore\nWashington  Airport.   He knew that he was being flown  to  Tokyo\nJapan, first class, by a mystery man who had prepaid him  $10,000\nfor a 1 hour meeting.  Not a bad start, he thought.  His  reputa-\ntion obviously preceded him.  Stephanie was hired to recruit him,\nthat  was obvious.  And that bothered Miles. He was  being  used.\nWasn't  he?  Or had he seduced her and the trip was a bonus?   He\nstill  liked  Stephanie, just not as much as  before.   It  never\noccurred  to  Miles, not for a second, that Stephanie  might  not\nhave liked him.\n\nAt  JFK  in New York, Miles connected to the 20  hour  flight  to\nTokyo  through  Anchorage, Alaska.  He had a brief  concern  that\nthis  was  the same route that KAL Flight 007 had taken  in  1983\nbefore  it  was shot down by the Soviets, but he  was  flying  an\nAmerican  carrier  with a four digit flight number.   He  allowed\nthat thought to remove any traces of worry.\n\nThe flight was a couple of hours out of New York when one of  the\nflight attendants came up to him.  \"Mr. Foster?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"  He looked up from the New York City Times he was reading.\n\n\"I  believe you dropped this?\"  She handed Miles a  large  sealed\nenvelope. His name had been written across the front with a large\nblack marker.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Miles. He took it gratefully.\n\nWhen  she left, he opened the strange envelope.  It  wasn't  his.\nInside there was a single sheet of paper.  Miles read it.\n\nMR. FOSTER\nWELCOME TO JAPAN.\n\nYOU WILL BE MET AT THE NARITA AIRPORT BY MY DRIVER AND CAR.  THEY\nARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL.\n\nWE  WILL MEET IN MY OFFICE AT 8:00 AM, WEDNESDAY,  SEPTEMBER  23.\nALL ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR YOUR PLEASURES.\n\nRESPECTFULLY\n\nTAKI HOMOSOTO\n\nThe name meant nothing to him so he forgot about it.  He had more\nimportant things to do.  His membership in the Mile High Club was\nin jeopardy.  He had not yet made it with a female flight attend-\nant.\n\nThey landed, 18 hours and 1 day later in Tokyo.   Miles was now a\nmember in good standing.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Thursday, September 3\n     Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport\n\n\"DFW, this is American 1137, heading 125 at 3500.\"\n\n\"Roger American 1137, got you loud and green.  Maintain 125, full\ncircle 40 miles then 215 for 40.\"\n\n\"Traffic Dallas?\"\n\n\"Heavy.   Weather's been strong.  On again off again.   Piled  up\npretty good.\"\n\n\"Sheers?\"\n\n\"None so far.  Ah, you're a '37, you carry a sheer monitor.   You\ngot   it  made.  Have to baby sit some 0's and '27's.  May  be  a\nwhile.\"\n\n\"Roger Dallas.  125 40, 215 40. Maintaining 12 point 5.\"\n\n\"Roger 1137.\"\n\nThe  control  tower at DFW airport was busier than  normal.   The\ndozen or so large green radar screens glowed eerily and made  the\nair  traffic controllers appear pallid under the  haunting  light\nemitted  from  around  the consoles.   Severe  weather  patterns,\nafternoon  Texas  thunderstorms  had  intermittently  closed  the\nairport  forcing  a  planes to hold in a 120  mile  pattern  over\nDallas and Fort Worth.\n\nMany  of  the tower crew had been at their stations for  2  hours\npast their normal quitting time due to street traffic delays  and\nhighway pileups that had kept shift replacements from arriving on\ntime.    Planes were late coming in, late departing,  connections\nwere  being missed.  Tensions were high on the ground and in  the\nair by both the airline personnel and travelers alike.  It was  a\nchaotic day at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.\n\n\"Chad?  Cm'ere,\" said Paul Gatwick, the newest and youngest,  and\nleast burnt out of the day shift flight controllers.\n\nShift supervisor Chad Phillips came right over.  \"What you  got?\"\nHe asked looking at the radar screen.\n\n\"See  these three bogies?\"  Paul pointed at three spots with  his\nfinger.\n\n\"Bogies?  What are those symbols?\"\n\n\"They  just  appeared,  out of nowhere.  I  don't  think  they're\nthere.   And over here,\" he pointed, \"that was Delta  210.   It's\ngone.\"   Paul  spoke calmly, in the professional  manner  he  was\ntrained. He looked up at Chad, awaiting instructions.\n\n\"Mike,\" Chad said to the controller seated next to Paul.  \"Switch\nand  copy 14, please.  Fast.\"  Chad looked over to Mike's  screen\nand saw the same pattern.  \"Paul, run a level 2 diagnostic.  What\nwas the Delta pattern?\"\n\n\"Same as the others, circle.  He's at 45 doing a 90 round.\"\n\n\"Tell him to hold, and verify on board transponder.\"  Chad  spoke\nrapidly and his authority wasn't questioned.\n\n\"Mike,  see if we can get any visuals on the bogies.  They  might\nbe a bounce.\"\n\nChad  took charge and, especially in this weather, was  concerned\nwith  safety first and schedules last.  In less than a minute  he\nhad  verified that Delta 210 was not on any screen,  three  other\nghost  planes  meandered  through the airspace,  and  that  their\nequipment was functioning properly.\n\n\"Dallas,\"  the calm pilot voice said, \"American 1137,  requesting\nupdate.  It's getting a little tight up here.\"\n\n\"Roger,  1137,\"  Gatwick  said  nervously.   \"Give  me  a  second\nhere . . .\"\n\n\"Dallas, what's the problem?\"\n\n\"Just a check . . .\"\n\nChad immediately told the operator of the ETMS computer to notify\nthe FAA and Department of Transportation that a potential  situa-\ntion     was developing.  The Enhanced Traffic Management  System\nwas  designed  to  create a complete picture  of  every  airplane\nflying within domestic air space.\n\nAll  status  information, on every known flight in  progress  and\nevery commercial plane on the ground,  is transmitted from the 22\nARTCC's, (Air Route Traffic Control Centers) to an FAA  Technical\nCenter in Atlantic City and then sent by land and satellite to  a\nDoT  Systems Center.  There, an array of DEC VAX super mini  com-\nputers  process the constant influx of raw data and send back  an\nupdated map across the ETMS every five minutes.\n\nChad  zoomed  in on the picture of the country into the  DFW  ap-\nproach area and confirmed that the airplanes in question were not\nappearing  on  the National Airspace System data fields  or  dis-\nplays.  Something was drastically wrong.\n\n\"Chad, take a look here!\" Another controller urgently called out.\n\nHis radar monitor had more bogies than Paul's.  \"I lost a  Delta,\ntoo, 1258.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"37.\"\n\n\"Shit,\"  said Chad.  \"We gotta get these guys wide, they have  to\nknow  what's happening.\"  He called over to  another  controller.\n\"Get  on  the wire, divert all traffic.  Call  the  boss.   We're\nclosing  it  down.\"  The controllers had the power to  close  the\nairport,  and direct all flight operations from the tower.   Air-\nport  management  wasn't always fond of their autonomy,  but  the\ntower's concern was safety at all costs.\n\n\"Another one's gone,\" said Paul.  \"That's three 37's gone.   Have\nthey had a recall lately?\"\n\nThe ETMS operator asked the computer for a status on 737's  else-\nwhere.   \"Chad, we're not the only ones,\" she said.  \"O'Hare  and\nLAX have problems, too.\"\n\n\"OK, everybody, listen up,\" Chad said.  \"Stack 'em, pack 'em  and\nrack 'em.  Use those outer markers, people.  Tell them to believe\ntheir eyes.  Find the 37's.  Let 'em know their transponders  are\ngoing.  Then, bring 'em down one by one.\"\n\nThe  emergency  speaker  suddenly rang out.  \"Shit!  Dive!\"   The\ncaptain of American 1137 ordered his plane to accelerate  ground-\nward  for 10 seconds, descending 2500 feet, to avoid  hitting  an\noncoming, and lost, DC-9.\n\n\"Dallas,  Mayday, Mayday.  What the fuck's going on  down  there?\nThis is worse than the freeway . . .\"\n\nThe emergency procedure was one they had practiced over and over,\nbut  rarely was it necessary for a full scale test.  The FAA  was\ngoing to be all over DFW and a dozen other airports within hours,\nand Chad wanted to be prepared.  He ordered a formal notification\nto Boeing that they had identified a potentially serious malfunc-\ntion.  Please make your emergency technical support crews  avail-\nable immediately.\n\nOf  the 100 plus flights under DFW control all 17 of  the  Boeing\n737's  disappeared from the radar screen,  replaced by dozens  of\nbogies with meaningless signatures.\n\n\"Dallas,  American 1137 requests emergency landing . .  .we  have\nseveral injured passengers who require immediate medical  assist-\nance.\"\n\n\"Roger, 1137,\" Gatwick blurted back.  \"Copy, EP.  Radar status?\"\n\n\"Nominal,\" said the shaken American pilot.\n\n\"Good.  Runway 21B.  We'll be waiting.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nBy 5:00 PM, Pacific time, Boeing was notified by airports  across\nthe country that their 737's were having catastrophic transponder\nfailure.  Takeoffs were ordered stopped at major airports and the\nFAA  directed  that  every 737 be  immediately  grounded.   Chaos\nreigned in the airline terminals as delays of several hours to  a\nday were announced for most flights.  Police were needed to quell\nangry crowds who were stuck thousands of miles from home and were\ngoing  to miss critical business liaisons.  There is  nothing  we\ncan do, every airline explained to no avail.\n\nSlowly, the planes were brought down, pilots relying on VFR since\nthey  couldn't  count on any help from the ground.   At  airports\nwhere weather prohibited VFR landings, and the planes had  enough\nfuel,  they were redirected to nearby airports.  Nearly  a  dozen\nemergency landings in a two hours period set new records that the\nFAA  preferred  didn't exist.  A field day for the media,  and  a\ncertain  decrease  in future passenger activity until  the  shock\nwore off.\n\nThe  National  Transportation Safety  Board  had  representatives\nmonitoring the situation within an hour of the first reports from\nDallas,  San Francisco, Atlanta, and Tampa.  When all 737's  were\naccounted for,  the individual airports and the FAA lifted flight\nrestrictions  and left it to the airlines to straighten  out  the\nscheduling  mess.  One hundred thousand stranded  passengers  and\nalmost 30% of the domestic civilian air fleet was grounded.\n\nIt was a good thing their reservation computers hadn't gone down.\nDamn good thing.\n\n* * * * *\n\nDISASTER IN AIR CREATES PANIC ON GROUND\nby Scott Mason\n\n\"A  national  tragedy was avoided today by the  quick  and  brave\nactions of hundreds of air traffic controllers and pilots working\nin harmony,\" a spokesperson for The Department of  Transportation\nsaid,  commenting  on  yesterday's failure  of  the  computerized\ntransponder systems in Boeing 737 airplanes.\n\n\"In  the interest of safety for all concerned, 737's will not  be\npermitted  to  fly commercially until a  full  investigation  has\ntaken  place.\" the spokesperson continued.  \"That process  should\nbe complete within 30 days.\"\n\nIn  all, 114 people were sent to hospitals, 29 in serious  condi-\ntion,   as a result of injuries sustained while pilots  performed\ndangerous gut wrenching maneuvers to avoid mid-air collisions.\n\nNeither Boeing nor the Transportation Safety Board would  comment\non how computer errors could suddenly affect so many airplanes at\nonce, but some  computer experts have pointed out the possibility\nof sabotage.  According to Harold Greenwood, an aeronautic  elec-\ntronics  specialist with Air Systems Design in Alpharetta,  Geor-\ngia,  \"there  is a real and definite possibility that  there  has\nbeen  a  specific attack on the airline  computers.  Probably  by\nhackers.   Either that or the most devastating computer  program-\nming error in history.\"\n\nGovernment  officials  discounted Greenwood's theories  and  said\nthere is no place for wild speculation that could create panic in\nthe  minds of the public.   None the less,  flight  cancellations\nbusied the phones at most airlines and travel agencies, while the\ngargantuan  task  of rescheduling thousands of flights  with  30%\nless  planes  began.   Airline officials who didn't  want  to  be\nquoted estimated that it would take at least a week to bring  the\nsystem back together,\n\nAirline  fares will increase next Monday by at least 10%  and  as\nmuch as 40% on some routes that will not be restored fully.\n\nThe tone of the press conference held at the DoT was one of  both\nbitterness and shock as was that of sampled public opinion.\n\n\"I think I'll take the train.\"\n\n\"Computers?   They always blame the computers.  Who's  really  at\nfault?\"\n\n\n\"They're  just  as bad as the oil companies.   Something  goes  a\nlittle wrong and they jack up the prices.\"\n\nThe  National  Transportation  Safety Board said  it  would  also\ninstitute  a  series of preventative maintenance steps  on  other\nairplanes' computer systems to insure that such a global  failure\nis never repeated.\n\nMajor  domestic airlines announced they would try to lease  addi-\ntional planes from other countries, but could not guarantee prior\nservice  performance  for 3 to 6 months.   Preliminary  estimates\nplace  the  cost of this debacle at between $800 Million  and  $2\nBillion if the entire 737 fleet is grounded for only 2 weeks.\n\nThe  Stock Market reacted poorly to the news, and  transportation\nstocks dove an average of 27% in heavy trading.\n\nThe  White  House  issued a brief  statement  congratulating  the\nairline industry for its handling of the situation and wished its\nbest to all inconvenienced and injured travelers.\n\nClass  action suits will be filed next week against the  airlines\nand Boeing as a result of the computer malfunction. This is Scott\nMason, riding the train.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Doug,\"  pleaded 39 year old veteran reporter Scott Mason.   \"Not\nanother  computer virus story . . .\"   Scott childishly  shrugged\nhis shoulders in mock defeat.\n\n\"Stop your whining,\" Doug ordered in fun.  \"You are the  special-\nist,\" he chided.\n\nWhen the story first came across the wire, Scott was the  logical\nchoice.   In only seven years as a reporter Scott Mason  had  de-\nveloped quite a reputation for himself, and for the New York City\nTimes.   Doug  had had to eat his words from years  earlier  more\ntimes than he cared to remember, but Scott's head had not swelled\nto  the size of his fan club, which was the bane of so many  suc-\ncessful writers. He knew he was good, just like he had told Doug\n\n\"There is nothing sexy about viruses anymore,\" said Scott  trying\nto politely ignore his boss to the point he would just leave.\n\n\"Christ  Almighty,\" the chubby balding sixtyish editor  exploded.\nDoug's  periodic exclamatory outbursts at Scott's nonchalance  on\ncritical issues were legendary.  \"The man who puts Cold Fusion on\nthe  front  page of every paper in the country  doesn't  think  a\nvirus is sexy enough for the public.  Good night!\"\n\n\"That's not what I'm saying.\"  Scott had to defend this one.   \"I\nfinally  got someone to go on the record about the  solar  payoff\nscandals between Oil and Congress . . .\"\n\n\"Then the virus story will give you a little break,\" kidded Doug.\n\"You've been working too hard.\"\n\n\"Damn  it, Doug,\" Scott defied.  \"Viruses are a dime a dozen  and\nworse,  there's no one behind it, there's nobody there.   There's\nno story  . . .\"\n\n\"Then  find one.  That's what we pay you for.\"  Doug loudly  mut-\ntered  a few choice words that his paper wouldn't be caught  dead\nprinting.   \"Besides, you're the only one left.\"  As he  left  he\npatted Scott on the back saying, \"thanks.  Really.\"\n\n\"God, I hate this job.\"\n\nScott  Mason loved his job, after all it was his invention  seven\nyears  ago  when he first pitched it to Doug.   Scott's  original\nidea had worked.  Scott Mason alone, under the banner of the  New\nYork  City Times, virtually pioneered Scientific Journalism as  a\nmedia form in its own right.\n\nScott  Mason was still its most vocal proponent, just as  he  was\nwhen  he connived his way into a job with the Times, and  without\nany journalistic experience.  It was a childhood fantasy.\n\nDoug remembered the day clearly.  \"That's a new one on me,\"  Doug\nhad said with amusement when the mildly arrogant but very likable\nMason  had  gotten  cornered him,  somehow  bypassing  personnel.\nPoints  for aggressiveness, points for creativity and points  for\nbrass balls.  \"What is Scientific Journalism?\"\n\n\"Scientific Journalism is stripping away all of the long  techni-\ncal  terms that science hides behind, and bringing the  facts  to\nthe people at home.\"\n\n\"We   have   a  quite  adequate  Science  Section,   a   computer\ncolumn  . . .and we pick up the big stories.\"  Doug had tried  to\nbe polite.\n\n\"That's  not what I mean,\" Scott explained.  \"Everybody  and  his\ndead  brother can write about the machines and the computers  and\nthe software.  I'm talking about finding the people, the meaning,\nthe impact behind the technology.\"\n\n\"No one would be interested,\" objected Doug.\n\nDoug was wrong.\n\nScott  Mason immediately acclimated to the modus operandi of  the\nnews  business  and actually locked onto the collapse  of  Kaypro\nComputers and the odd founding family who rode serendipity  until\ncompetence  was  required for survival.   The antics of  the  Kay\nfamily  earned Mason a respectable following in his articles  and\ncontributions as well as several libel and slander suits from the\nKays.   Trouble was, it's not against the law to print the  truth\nor a third party speculations, as long as they're not  malicious.\nScott instinctively knew how to ride the fine edge between  false\naccusations and impersonal objectivity.\n\nCold  Fusion, the brief prayer for immediate, cheap energy  inde-\npendence made headlines, but Scott Mason dug deep and found  that\nsome  of  the advocates of Cold Fusion had  vested  interests  in\npalladium  and iridium mining concerns.  He also  discovered  how\nthe experiments had been staged well enough to fool most experts.\nScott  had located one expert who wasn't fooled and  could  prove\nit.   Scott  Mason rode the crest of the Cold  Fusion  story  for\nmonths before it became old news and the Hubble Telescope  fiasco\ntook its place.\n\nThe  fiasco  of  the Hubble Telescope was nothing  new  to  Scott\nMason's readers.  He had published months before its launch  that\nthe  mirrors were defective, but the government didn't  heed  the\nwhistle blower's advice.  The optical measurement computers which\ngrind  the mirrors of the telescope had a software  program  that\nwas  never tested before being used on the Hubble.  The  GSA  had\nbeen  tricked by the contractor's test results and Scott  discov-\nered the discrepencies.\n\nWhen  Gene-Tech  covered  up the accidental  release  of  mutated\nspores  into the atmosphere from their genetic engineering  labs,\nScott Mason was the one reporter who had established enough of  a\nreputation as both a fair reporter, and also one that  understood\nthe technology.  Thanks to Mason's early diagnosis and the Times'\nresponsible publishing, a potentially cataclysmic genetic  disas-\nter was averted.\n\nThe  software problems with Star Wars and Brilliant Pebbles,  the\npayoffs that allowed defective X-Ray lasers to be shipped to  the\ntesting ground outside of Las Vegas - Scott Mason was there.   He\ntraced  the  Libyan chemical weapons plant back to  West  Germany\nwhich triggered the subsequent destruction of the plant.\n\nScott's  outlook was simple.  \"It's a matter of  recognizing  the\npossibilities  and then the probabilities.  Therefore,  if  some-\nthing  is possible, someone, somewhere will do  it.   Guaranteed.\nSince someone's doing it, then it's only a matter of catching him\nin the act.\"\n\n\"Besides,\" he would tell anyone who would listen, \"computers  and\ntechnology and electronics represent  trillions of dollars  annu-\nally.   To believe that there isn't interesting,  human  interest\nand  profound news to be found, is pure blindness.  The  fear  of\nthe  unknown, the ignorance of what happens on the other side  of\nthe buttons we push, is an enemy wrapped in the shrouds of  time,\nwell disguised and easily avoided.\"\n\nScott  successfully opened the wounds of ignorance and  technical\napathy and made he and the Times the de facto standard in  Scien-\ntific Journalism.\n\nHis reputation as a expert in anything technical endeared him  to\nfellow Times' reporters.  Scott often became the technical  back-\nbone of articles that did not carry his name.  But that was good.\nThe journalists' barter system.  Scott Mason was not considered a\ncompetitor to the other reporters because of his areas of  inter-\nest  and  the skills he brought with him to the paper.   And,  he\ndidn't flaunt his knowledge.  To Scott's way of thinking, techni-\ncal  fluency  should be as required as are the ABC's, so  it  was\nwith the dedication of a teacher and the experience of  simplifi-\ncation  that Scott undertook it to openly help anyone who  wanted\nto learn.  His efforts were deeply appreciated.\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                            Chapter 2\n     Friday, September 4\n     San Francisco, California\n\nMr. Henson?\"\n\n\"Yes, Maggie?\"  Henson responded over the hands free phone on his\nhighly  polished black marble desk.  He never looked up from  the\npapers he was perusing.\n\n\"There's a John Fullmaster for you.\"\n\n\"Who?\" he asked absent mindedly.\n\n\"Ah, John Fullmaster.\"\n\n\"I don't know a Fullman do I?  Who is he?\"\n\n\"That's Fullmaster, sir, and he says its personal.\"\n\nRobert  Henson, chairman and CEO of Perris, Miller and  Stevenson\nleaned  back in the plush leather chair.  A brief perplexed  look\ncovered  his  face and then a sigh of resignation.   \"Very  well,\ntell him I'll take it in a minute.\"\n\nAs the young highly visible leader of one of the most  successful\nWall  Street investment banking firms during the merger mania  of\nthe 1980's, he had grown accustomed to cold calls from aggressive\nyoung  brokers  who wanted a chance to pitch him  on  sure  bets.\nMost  often he simply ignored the calls, or referred them to  his\ncapable and copious staff.  Upon occasion, though, he would amuse\nhimself with such calls by putting the caller through  salesmen's\nhell;  he would permit them to give their pitch,  actually  sound\ninterested, permit the naive to believe that their call to Robert\nHenson would lead them to a pot of gold, then only to bring  them\ndown  as harshly as he could.  It was the only seeming  diversion\nRobert Henson had from the daily grueling regimen of earning  fat\nfees  in the most somber of Wall Street activities.  He needed  a\nbreak anyway.\n\n\"Robert  Henson.  May I help you?\"  He said into the  phone.   It\nwas  as  much a command as a question.  From the 46th.  floor  SW\ncorner  office, Henson stared out over Lower New York  Bay  where\nthe Statue of Liberty reigned.\n\n\"Thank  you for taking my call Mr. Henson.\"  The caller's  proper\nCentral  London  accent was engaging and conveyed  assurance  and\npropriety. \"I am calling in reference to the proposed merger  you\nare  arranging between Second Boston Financial and Winston  Ellis\nServices.   I don't believe that the SEC will be  impressed  with\nthe  falsified figures you have generated to drive up your  fees.\nDon't you agree.\"\n\nHenson  bolted  upright in his chair and glared into  the  phone.\n\"Who the hell is this?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Merely a concerned citizen, sir.\"  The cheeky caller paused.  \"I\nasked, sir, don't you agree?\"\n\n\"Listen,\"  Henson shouted into the phone.  I don't know  who  the\nhell  you are, nor what you want, but all filings made  with  the\nSEC  are public and available to anyone.  Even the press  whom  I\nassume you represent . . .\"\n\n\"I am not with the press Mr. Henson,\" the voice calmly interrupt-\ned.  \"All  the same, I am sure that they would be quite interest-\ned  in  what I have to say.  Or, more precisely, what I  have  to\nshow them.\"\n\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\" Henson screamed.\n\n\"Specifically,  you inflated the earnings of Winston  Ellis  over\n40%  by burying certain write downs and deferred losses.   I  be-\nlieve  you are familiar with the numbers.  Didn't you  have  them\naltered yourself?\"\n\nHenson  paled  as the caller spoke to him matter of  factly.  His\neyes  darted  around his spacious and opulent  office  as  though\nsomeone  might be listening.  He shifted uneasily  in his  chair,\nleaned into the phone and spoke quietly.\n\n\"I don't know what you're taking about.\"\n\n\"I think you do, Mr. Henson.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"  Henson asked cautiously.\n\n\"Merely  your acknowledgment, to me, right now, that the  figures\nwere falsified, at your suggestion, and . . .\"\n\n\"I admit nothing.  Nothing.\"  Henson hung up the phone.\n\nShaken,  he dialed the phone, twice.  In his haste  he  misdialed\nthe first time.  \"Get me Brocker. Now. This is Henson.\"\n\n\"Brocker,\" the other end of the phone responded nonchalantly.\n\n\"Bill, Bob here.  We got troubles.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Senator  Rickfield?   I think you better take this  call.\"   Ken\nBoyers was earnest in his suggestion.  The aged Senator looked up\nand  recognized a certain urgency.  The youthful 50 year old  Ken\nBoyers  had  been with Senator Merrill Rickfield  since  the  mid\n1960's  as an aide de campe, a permanent fixture  in  Rickfield's\nnational  success.  Ken preferred the number two spot, to be  the\nman  in  the background rather the one in the public  light.   He\nfelt he could more effectively wield power  without the  constant\nsurveillance  of  the  press.  Only when events  and  deals  were\ncompletely  orchestrated were they made public, and then  Merrill\ncould take the  credit. The arrangement suited them both.\n\nRickfield  indicated that his secretary and the two  junior  aids\nshould leave the room.  \"What is it Ken?\"\n\n\"Just take the call, listen carefully, and then we'll talk.\"\n\n\"Who is  it, Ken. I don't talk to every. . .\"\n\n\"Merrill  .  . .pick up the phone.\" It was an  order.   They  had\nworked together long enough to afford Ken the luxury of  ordering\na U.S. Senator around.\n\n\"This  is  Senator Rickfield, may I help  you?\"   The  solicitous\ncampaign voice, smiling and inviting,  disguised the puzzled look\nhe  gave  his senior aide.  Within a few seconds  the  puzzlement\ngave  way  to open mouthed silent shock and  then,  only  moments\nlater  to  overt fear.  He stared with disbelief at  Ken  Boyers.\nAghast, he gently put the phone back in its cradle.\n\n\"Ken,\" Rickfield haltingly spoke. \"Who the hell was that and  how\nin  blazes did he know about the deal with Credite Suisse?   Only\nyou, me and General Young knew.\"  He rose slowly rose and  looked\naccusingly at Ken.\n\n\"C'mon Merrill, I have as much to lose as you.\"\n\n\"The  hell  you do.\"  He was growling. \"I'm  a  respected  United\nStates  Senator.  They can string me up from the highest  yardarm\njust  like they did Nixon and I'm not playing to lose.   Besides,\nI'm the one the public knows while you're invisible. It's my  ass\nand  you know it.  Now, and I mean now, tell me what the hell  is\ngoing on?  There were only three of us . . .\"\n\n\"And  the bank,\" Ken quickly interjected to deflect   the  verbal\nonslaught.\n\n\"Screw the bank.  They use numbers.  Numbers, Ken.  That was  the\nplan.   But this son  of a bitch knew the numbers.  Damn  it,  he\nknew the numbers Ken!\"\n\n\"Merrill, calm down.\"\n\n\"Calm down?  You have some nerve to tell me to calm down.  Do you\nknow  what  would happen if anyone, and I mean anyone  finds  out\nabout  .  .  .\"  Rickfield looked around and  thought  better  of\nfinishing the sentence.\n\n\"Yes I know.  As well as you do.  Jesus Christ, I helped set  the\nwhole thing up.  Remember?\"  He approached Merrill Rickfield  and\ntouched  the Senator's shoulder. \"Maybe it's a hoax?   Just  some\nlucky guess by some scum bag who . . .\"\n\n\"Bullshit.\" The senator turned abruptly.  \"I want a tee off  time\nas  soon  as  possible.  Even sooner.  And make  damn  sure  that\nbastard Young is there.  Alone.  It's a threesome.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nJohn  Faulkner was lazing at his estate  in the eminently  exclu-\nsive, obscenely expensive Bell Canyon, twenty miles north of  Los\nAngeles.   Even though it was Monday, he just wasn't up to  going\ninto   the  office.  As Executive Vice  President  of  California\nNational Bank, with over twenty billion in assets, he could  pick\nand choose his hours.  This Tuesday he chose  to read by the pool\nand  enjoy the warm and clear September California  morning.  The\nview  of  the San Gabriel mountains was so distracting  that  his\nnormal thirty minute scan of the Wall Street Journal took  nearly\ntwo hours.\n\nHis estate was the one place where Faulkner was guaranteed priva-\ncy  and anonymity.  High profile Los Angeles banking  required  a\nsocial  presence and his face, along with his wife's, graced  the\nsocial  pages  every  time an event of any  gossip-magnitude  oc-\ncurred.  He craved his private time.\n\nFaulkner's  standing instruction with his secretary was never  to\ncall  him  at home unless \"the bank is nuked, or  I  die\"   which\nwhen translated meant, \"Don't call me, I'll call you.\"  His  wife\nwas  the  only  other person with the  private  phone  number  he\nchanged every month to insure his solitude.\n\nThe  phone rang.  It never rang.  At least not in recent  memory.\nHe  used it to dial out; but it was never used to receive  calls.\nThe  warble  surprised him so, that he let it  ring  three  times\nbefore suspiciously picking it up.  Damn  it, he thought.  I just\ngot a new number last week. I'll have to  have it changed again.\n\n\"Hello?\" he asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Good  morning Mr. Faulkner. I just called to let you  know  that\nyour  secret is safe with me.\"  Faulkner itched to  identify  the\nvoice behind the well educated British accent, but that  fleeting\nthought dissipated at the import of the words being spoken.\n\n\"Who  is this? What secret?\"\n\n\"Oh,  dear me. I am sorry, where are my manners.  I am  referring\nto  the millions you have embezzled from your own bank  to  cover\nyour  gambling  losses last  year.  Don't worry. I won't  tell  a\nsoul.\"  The line went dead.\n\nSir George dialed the next number on his list after scanning  the\nprofile.   The phone was answered by a timid sounding  gentleman.\nSir George began his fourth pitch of the day.  \"Mr. Hugh Sidneys?\nI would like to talk to you about a small banking problem I think\nyou have . . .\"\n\nSir  George  Sterling made another thirty four  calls  that  day.\nEach  one alarmingly similar to the first three.  Not  that  they\nalarmed him.  They merely alarmed, often severely, the recipients\nof his calls.  In most cases he had never heard of the persons he\nwas calling, and the contents of his messages were often  cryptic\nto  him.  But it didn't take him long to realize that every  call\nwas  some form of veiled, or not so veiled threat.  But  his  in-\nstructions  had been clear.  Do not threaten.  Just pass  on  the\ncontents of the messages on his list to their designees.  Do  not\nleave  any  message unless he had confirmed, to the best  of  his\nability  that he was actually speaking to the party in  question.\nIf  he received any trouble in reaching his intended targets,  by\nsecretaries  or aides, he was only to pass on a preliminary  mes-\nsage.   These were especially cryptic, but in all cases,  perhaps\nwith a little prod, his call was put through.\n\nAt  the end of the first day of his assignment, Sir George  Ster-\nling  walked onto his balcony overlooking San Francisco  Bay  and\nreflected on his good fortune.  If he hadn't been stuck in Athens\nlast  year, wondering where his next score would come from.   How\nstrange the world works, he thought.  Damn lucky he became a Sir,\nand at the tender age of twenty nine at that.\n\nHis  title,  actually purchased from The  Royal  Title  Assurance\nCompany,  Ltd. in London in 1987 for a mere 5000 pounds had  per-\nmitted George Toft to leave the perennial industrial smog of  the\neternally drizzly commonness of Manchester, England and assume  a\nnew  identity.   It  was one of the few ways out  of  the  dismal\nexistence that generations before him had tolerated with a  stiff\nupper  lip.    As a petty thief he had done  'awright',  but  one\nscore had left him with more money than he had ever seen. That is\nwhen he became a Sir, albeit one purchased.\n\nHe spent several months impressing mostly himself as he  traveled\nEurope.  With the help of Eliza Doolittle,  Sir George  perfected\nhis  adapted upper crust London accent.  His natural  speech  was\nthat  of  a Liverpuddlian with a bag of marbles in  his  mouth  -\ntotally unintelligible when drunk.  But his royal speech was  now\nthat  of a Gentleman from the House of Lords.  Slow  and  precise\nwhen  appropriate  or a practiced articulateness   when  speaking\nrapidly.  It initially took some effort, but he could now correct\nhis  slips instantly. No one noticed anymore.  Second  nature  it\nbecame for George Sterling, n<130> Toft.\n\nAthens was the end of his tour and where he had spent the last of\nhis  money.  George, Sir George, sat sipping Metaxa  in  Sintigma\nSquare  next to the Royal Gardens and the imposing  Hotel  Grande\nBritagne  styled  in nineteenth century rococo  elegance.  As  he\nenjoyed the balmy spring Athens evening pondering his next  move,\nas  either  George Toft of Sir George Sterling,  a  well  dressed\ngentleman sat down at his tiny wrought iron table.\n\n\"Sir George?\"  The visitor offered his hand.\n\nGeorge  extended  his hand, not yet aware that his guest  had  no\nreason whatsoever to know who he was.\n\n\"Sir  George?  Do I have the Sir George Sterling  of  Briarshire,\nEssex?\"   The accent was trans European.  Internationally  cosmo-\npolitan.   German? Dutch? It didn't matter, Sir George  had  been\nrecognized.\n\nGeorge  rose  slightly.  \"Yes, yes. Of course. Excuse me,  I  was\nlost  in  thought, you know.  Sir George  Sterling.   Of  course.\nPlease do be seated.\"\n\nThe  stranger said, \"Sir George, would you be offended if  I  of-\nfered  you another drink, and perhaps took a few minutes of  your\nvaluable time?\"  The man smiled genuinely and sat himself  across\nfrom George before any reply.  He knew what the answer would be.\n\n\"Please  be seated.  Metaxa would it be for you, sir?\"   The  man\nnodded  yes.  \"Garcon?\"  George waved two fingers at one  of  the\nwhite-jacketed waiters who worked in the outdoor cafe.   \"Metaxa,\nparakalo!\"   Greek waiters are not known for their  graciousness,\nso  a  brief grunt and nod was an  acceptable  response.   George\nreturned his attention to his nocturnal visitor. \"I don't believe\nI've had the pleasure . . .\" he said in his most formal voice.\n\n\"Sir George, please just call me Alex.  Last names, are so, well,\nso unnecessary among men like us. Don't you agree?\"\n\nGeorge nodded assent.  \"Yes, quite. Alex then, it is.  How may  I\nassist you?\"\n\n\"Oh  no,  Sir George, it is I who may be able to assist  you.   I\nunderstand  that you would like to continue your, shall  we  say,\nextended  sabbatical.   Would  that be a  fair  appraisal?\"   The\nMetaxas arrived and Alex excused the waiter with two 1000 Drachma\nnotes.  The overtipping guaranteed privacy.\n\nGeorge looked closely at Alex. Very well dressed.  A Saville  was\nit? Perhaps.  Maybe Lubenstrasse.  He didn't care. This  stranger\nhad either keen insight into George's current plight or had heard\nof  his escapades across the Southern Mediterranean.  Royalty  on\nSabbatical was an unaccostable lie that regularly passed critical\nscrutiny.\n\n\"Fair.  Yes sir, quite fair.  What exactly can you do for me,  or\ncan we do for each other?\"\n\n\"An  even  more accurate portrayal my friend, yes,  do  for  each\nother.\"  Alex paused for effect and to sip his  Metaxa.   \"Simply\nput  Sir George, I have the need for a well spoken  gentleman  to\nrepresent me for a period of perhaps, three months, perhaps  more\nif all goes well.  Would that fit into your schedule?\"\n\n\"I  see no reason that  I mightn't be able to, take a  sabbatical\nfrom  my  sabbatical  if  .  .  .well  now,  how  should   I  put\nthis . . .\"\n\n\" . . .that you are adequately compensated to take time away from\nyour valuable projects?\"\n\n\"Yes,  yes  quite  so.  Not that I am ordinarily  for  hire,  you\nunderstand,   it's  just  that . . .\".  Alex  detected  a  slight\nstutter as Sir George spoke.\n\nAlex held up both hands in a gesture of understanding.   \"No need\nto  continue my dear Sir George.  I do thoroughly  recognize  the\nexorbitant  costs  associated  with your studies  and  would  not\nexpect your efforts, on my behalf of course, to go unrewarded.\"\n\nGeorge  Toft was negotiating with a man he had never met,  for  a\ntask as yet unstated.  The only reason he didn't feel the discom-\nfort  that  one  should in such a situation is that  he  was   in\ndesperate need of money.  And, this stranger did seem to know who\nhe was, and did need his particular type  of expertise,  whatever\nthat was.\n\n\"What exactly do you require of me, Alex.  That is, what form  of\nrepresentation have you in mind?\"  He might as well find out what\nhe was  supposed to do before naming a price.\n\nAlex  laughed. \"Merely to be my voice.  It is so simple,  really.\nIn  exchange for that, and some travel, first class and  all  ex-\npenses to which you are accustomed, you will be handsomely paid.\"\nAlex  looked for Sir George's reaction to the proposed  fees.  He\nwas pleased with what he saw in George's face.\n\n  Crikey, this is too good to be true.  What's the  catch<D>.\nAs George ruminated his good fortune and the Metaxa, Alex contin-\nued.\n\n\"The  job  is  quite simple, really, but  requires  a  particular\ndelicacy  with which you are well acquainted. Each day  you  will\nreceive  a list of names.  There will be instructions  with  each\nname.  Call them at the numbers provided. Say only what is  writ-\nten.   Keep  notes of each call you make and I will  provide  you\nwith the means to transmit them to me in the strictest of  confi-\ndence. You and I will have no further personal contact, either if\nyou  accept or do not accept my proposition.  If we are  able  to\nreach  mutually agreeable terms, monies will be wired to  a  bank\naccount in your name.\"  Alex opened his jacket and handed  George\nan  envelop.   \"This is an advance if you accept. It  is  $25,000\nAmerican.  There is a phone number to call when you arrive in San\nFrancisco.  Follow  the instructions explicitly.  If you do  not,\nthere  will be no lists for you, no additional monies and I  will\nwant  this  money  back.  Any questions Sir  George?\"   Alex  was\nsmiling warmly but as serious as a heart attack.\n\nAlex  scanned  the contents of the envelope.   America.   He  had\nalways wanted to see the States.\n\n\"Yes,  Alex,  I do have one question.  Is  this  legal?\"   George\npeered at Alex for a clue.\n\n\"Do you really care?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Off you go then.  And good luck.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nSir George Sterling arrived in San Francisco airport the  follow-\ning evening.  He flew first class and impressed returning  Ameri-\ncan tourists with his invented pedigree and his construed  impor-\ntance.  What fun.  After the virtually nonexistent customs check,\nhe  called  the number inside the envelop.  It rang  three  times\nbefore answering.  Damn, it was a machine, he thought.\n\n\"Welcome to the United States, Sir George.  I hope you had a good\nflight.\"  The  voice was American, female, and  flight  attendant\nfriendly.   \"Please check into the San Francisco Airport  Hilton.\nYou will receive a call at 11 AM tomorrow.  Good night.\"   A dial\ntone replaced the lovely voice.  He dialed the number again.\n\nA mechanical voice responded instead. \"The number you have called\nin  no  longer in service. Please check the number  or  call  the\noperator for assistance.  The number you have called is no longer\nin service...\"\n\nGeorge dialed the number twice more before he gave up in frustra-\ntion. He had over $20,000 in cash, knew no one in America and for\nthe  first time in years, he felt abandoned.  What kind  of  joke\nwas  this?  Fly half way around the world and be greeted with  an\nout  of service number.  But the first voice had known his  name.\nThe Hilton.  Why not?\n\nAt precisely 11AM, the phone in Sir George Sterling's suite rang.\nHe was still somewhat jet lagged from his 18 hours of flying  and\nthe span of 10 time zones.  The Eggs Benedict was exquisite,  but\nAmericans could learn something about tea.  The phone rang again.\nHe casually picked it up.\n\n\"Good  morning, Sir George.  Please get a pencil and paper.   You\nhave fifteen seconds and then I will continue.\"  It was the  same\nalluring voice from yesterday. The paper and pen were right there\nat  the phone so he waited through 14 seconds of  silence.  \"Very\ngood. Please check out of the hotel and pay cash.  Proceed to the\nSan Francisco airport and from a pay phone, call 5-5-5-3-4-5-6 at\n1 P.M.  Have a note book and two pens  with you.  Good Bye. \"\n\nThe annoying dial tone returned.   What a bloody waste  of time.\n\nAt  1P.M. he called the number as he was instructed.  He  figured\nthat  since he was to have a notebook and pens he might  need  to\nwrite for  a while, so he used one of the phone booths that  pro-\nvides a seat and large writing surface.\n\n\"Good  afternoon Sir George.  In ten seconds,  your  instructions\nwill  begin.\"   Again, that same voice, but  it  almost  appeared\ncondescending  to  him now.  Isn't that the way  when  you  can't\nrespond.   The  voice continued.  \"Catch the next flight  to  New\nYork  City.  Stay at the Grand Hyatt Hotel at Grand Central  Sta-\ntion on 42nd. Street and Park Avenue.  Not a suite this time, Sir\nGeorge, just a regular room.\"   Sir George was startled at Alex's\nattention to detail.\n\n\"You  will  stay there for fourteen days.  On  56th.  street  and\nMadison  avenue is a school called CTI, Computer Training  Insti-\ntute.  You are to go to CTI and enroll in the following  classes:\nDOS,  that's D-O-S for beginners, Intermediate DOS  and  Advanced\nDOS.  You will also take WordPerfect I and II.  Lastly, and  most\nimportantly  you will take all three classes  on  Tele-Communica-\ntions.  They call it TC-I,  TC-II and TC-III.  These eight class-\nes will  take you ten days to complete.  Do not forget to pay  in\ncash. I will now pause for ten seconds.\"  Alex was writing  furi-\nously.  Computers?  He was scared silly of them.  Not that he had\never  had the opportunity or the need or the desire to use  them,\njust  from lack of exposure and the corresponding ignorance.  But\nif this meant he could keep the $25,000 he would do it.  What the\nhell.\n\n\"After  you enroll, go to 45 West 47th street to a  store  called\nDiscount Computer Shoppe.  Buy the following equipment with cash.\nOne Pro-Start 486-80 computer with 8 Meg  RAM.  That's 8 M-E-G R-\nA-M and ask for a high resolution color monitor.  Also  purchase,\nand  have them install a high speed modem, M-O-D-E-M.  Do not,  I\nrepeat,  do not purchase a printer of any type.  No printers  Sir\nGeorge.   You are never to use a printer. Ever. Lastly, you  will\npurchase  a copy of Word Perfect and Crosstalk.  If you wish  any\ngames  for  your  amusement, that is up to you.   When  you  have\ncompleted  your studies you will call 212-555-6091.  Do not  call\nthat  number  before  you have completed your  studies.  This  is\nimperative.\"\n\nSir  George  was just writing, not comprehending a thing. It  was\nall gibberish to him.  Pure gibberish.\n\n\"Sir George.\"  The female voice got serious, very serious for the\nfirst time in their relationship. \"You are to speak to no one,  I\nrepeat,  no  one, of the nature of your business, the  manner  in\nwhich  you receive instructions,  or why computers have a  sudden\ninterest for you. Otherwise our deal is off and your advance will\nbe expected to be returned. Am I clear?\"\n\nGeorge  responded  quickly, \"Yes!\" before seeing  the  lunacy  of\nanswering a machine.\n\n\"Good,\"  the voice was friendly again.  \"Learn your lessons  well\nfor you will need the knowledge to perform your tasks.   Until we\nspeak  again, I thank  you, Sir George Sterling.\"  The line  went\ndead.\n\nGeorge Toft took his computer classes very seriously.  He had  in\nfact  bought  a few games to amuse himself and he  found  himself\nreally  enjoying  the work.  It was new, and exciting.  His  only\nsocial  distractions  were the sex shops on  Times  Square.   Red\nLight  Amsterdam or the Hamburg they weren't, so midnight  antics\nwith the Mario Brothers prevailed most evenings.  Besides,  there\nwas  a massive amount of homework.  Bloody hell, back to  school.\nHe excelled in his studies which pleased George a great deal.  In\nfact  most of the students in Sir George's computer  classes  ex-\ncelled.   The teachers were very pleased to have a group of  stu-\ndents  that actually progressed more rapidly than the  curriculum\ncalled  for. Pleasant change from the E Train Bimbos from Queens.\n\nThe  computer  teachers didn't know that a vast majority  of  the\nclass  members had good reason to study hard.  Most of  them  had\nreceived their own $25,000 scholarships.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Sunday, September 6\n     SDSU Campus, San Diego, California.\n\nWTFO\n\nthe computer screen displayed.

Hey, Lori's on the line. gotta go.\n\nTA\n\n     <<<<<< CONNECTION TERMINATED >>>>>>\n\nThe  screen of his communications program returned to a  list  of\nnames and phone numbers.  Lori said she'd be over in an hour  and\nSteven  Billings  was tempted to dial another couple  of  numbers\nbefore his date with Lori. But if he found something  interesting\nit might force him to be late, and Lori could not tolerate  play-\ning second fiddle to a computer.\n\nSteven  Billings, known as \"KIRK, where no man has gone  before\",\nby  fellow hackers, had finished his midterms at San Diego  State\nUniversity. The ritual labors were over and he looked forward  to\nsome relax time. Serious relax time.\n\nThe one recreation he craved, but downplayed to Lori, was  spend-\ning time with his computer.  She was jealous in some respects, in\nthat  it received as much attention from Steve as she  did.  Yet,\nshe also understood that computers were his first love, and  they\nwere part of his life long before she was. So, they came with the\nterritory.   Steve attended, upon occasion, classes at  SDSU,  La\nJolla. For a 21 year old transplant from Darien, Connecticut,  he\nlived in paradise.\n\nSteve's  single largest expense in life was his phone  bill,  and\ninstead  of working a regular job to earn spending  money,  Steve\ntutored  other  students in their computer courses.  Rather  than\nflaunt his skills to his teachers and risk extra assignments,  he\nwas more technically qualified than they were, he kept his  mouth\nshut,  sailed through classes, rarely studied and became  a  full\ntime  computer hacker.  He translated his every wish into a  com-\nmand that the computer obeyed.\n\nSteve  Billings did not fill the picture of a computer nerd.   He\nwas almost dashing with a firm golden tanned 175 pound body,  and\ndark  blond hair that caused the girls to turn their  heads.   He\nloved  the outdoors, the hot warmth of the summer to  the  cooler\nwarmth of the winter, surfing at the Cardiff Reef and betting  on\nfixed jai-alai games in Tijuana.  He played soccer and OTL, a San\nDiego  specific  version  of gloveless and  topless  co-ed  beach\nsoftball.  In short, he was a guy. A regular guy.\n\nThe  spotlessly groomed image of Steve Billings in  white  tennis\nshorts  and a \"Save the Whales\" tank-top eclectically  co-existed\nwith  the  sterile  surroundings of the  mammoth  super  computer\ncenter.   The  Cray Y-MP is about as big and bad  a  computer  as\nmoney can buy, and despite Steve's well known skills, the head of\nthe  Super  Computing Department couldn't help  but  cringe  when\nSteve  leaned  his surf board against the  helium  cooled  memory\nbanks of the twelve million dollar computer.\n\nHe  ran his shift at the computer lab so efficiently and  effort-\nlessly  that over time he spent more and more of his hours  there\nperusing through other people's computers. Now there was a  feel-\ning.   Hacking  through somebody else's  computer  without  their\nknowledge. The ultimate challenge, an infinity of  possibilities,\nan infinity of answers.\n\nThe  San Diego Union was an awful paper, Steve thought,  and  the\nevening  paper was even worse.  So he got copies of the New  York\nCity  Times when possible, either at a newsstand,  borrowed  from\nyesterday's Times reader or from the library.  Nice to get a real\nperspective on the world.  This Sunday he spent the $4.00 to  get\nhis own new, uncrumpled and unread copy of his revered paper, all\nthirty four pounds of it.  Alone.  Peace.\n\nReading  by  the  condo pool an article caught  his  eye.   Steve\nremembered  a story he had heard about a hacker who  had  invaded\nand  single  handedly stopped INTERNET, a computer  network  that\nconnected  together  tens of thousands of  computers  around  the\ncountry.\n\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Government Defense Network Halted by Hacker\n     by Scott Mason, New York City Times\n\nVaughn  Chase, a 17 year old high school student  Galbraith  High\nSchool in Ann Arbor, Michigan was indicted today on charges  that\nhe  infected  the  nationwide INTERNET network  with  a  computer\nvirus.   This  latest attack upon INTERNET is  reminiscent  of  a\nsimilar incident launched by Robert Morris of Cornell  University\nin November, 1988.\n\nAccording to the Computer Emergency Response Team, a DARPA  spon-\nsored  group,  if Mr. Chase had not left his name in  the  source\ncode of his virus, there would have been no way to track down the\nculprit.\n\nA computer virus is a small software program that is secretly put\ninto  a  computer, generally designed to cause  damage.  A  virus\nattaches  itself to other computer programs secretively. At  some\ntime after the parasite virus program is 'glued' into the comput-\ner,  it is reawakened on a specific date or by a  particular  se-\nquence of events.\n\nChase, though, actually infected INTERNET with a Worm.  A Worm is\na  program  that copies itself, over and over  and  over,  either\nfilling  the  computer's memory to capacity or slowing  down  its\noperation  to  a snail's pace.  In either case, the  results  are\ndevastating - effectively, the computer stops working.\n\nChase,  a  math wizard according to his  high  school  officials,\nreleased the Worm into Internet in early August with a detonation\ndate  of September 1, which brought thousands of computers  to  a\ngrinding halt.\n\nINTERNET  ties together tens of thousands of computers  from  the\nGovernment,  private industry, universities and defense  contrac-\ntors  all over the country.  Chase said he learned how to  access\nthe  unclassified computer network from passwords and  keys  dis-\ntributed on computer Bulletin Boards.\n\nComputer security experts worked for 3 days hours to first deter-\nmine  the cause of the network slowdown and then to  restore  the\nnetwork  to normal operation.  It has been estimated that  almost\n$100 Million in damage was caused by Mr. Chase's Worm.  Mr. Chase\nsaid  the  Worm was experimental, and was  accidentally  released\ninto  INTERNET when a piece of software he had  written  malfunc-\ntioned.  He apologized for any inconvenience he caused.\n\nThe  Attorney General of the State of Michigan is  examining  the\nlegal aspects of the case and it is expected that Mr. Chase  will\nbe  tried within in a year.  Mr. Chase was released  on  his  own\nrecognizance.\n\nThis  is  Scott Mason wondering why the  Pentagon  doesn't  shoot\nworms instead of bombs at enemy computers.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe  next day Steve Billings signed on to the SDSU/BBS  from  his\nsmall Mission Beach apartment. It was a local university Bulletin\nBoard  Service or BBS.  A BBS is like a library.  There  are  li-\nbraries of software which are free, and as a user you are  recip-\nrocally expected to donate software into the Public Domain.  Con-\nference  Halls or Conversation Pits on the BBS  are  free-for-all\ndiscussions where people at their keyboards can all have a 'live'\nconversation.  Anyone, using any computer, anywhere in the  world\ncan call up any BBS using regular phone lines.   No one cared  or\nknew  if  you  were skinny, fat, pimpled,  blind,  a  double  for\nChristy Brinkley or too chicken shit to talk to girls in  person.\nHere, everyone was equal.\n\n     Billings 234\n\n     XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\nThere was a brief pause.\n\nWELCOME TO THE SDSU/BBS.  STEVE BILLINGS, YOU ARE USER #109\n\nSteve Chose (12) for SERVICES:\n\nThe menu changed to a list of further options.  Each option would\npermit  the  user  to gain access to other  networks  around  the\ncountry.   From  one single entry point with  a  small  computer,\nanyone  could  'dial  up'  as it's called,  almost  any  of  over\n20,000,000 computers in the country tied into any of ten thousand\ndifferent networks.\n\n     SDSU/BBS WINDOW ON THE WORLD\n\n     NETWORK SERVICES MENU\n\nSteve  selected  CALNET, a network at Cal Tech  in  Los  Angeles.\nMany of the Universities have permanent connections between their\ncomputers.\n\n     LOGON: Billings014\n\n     PASSWORD: XXXXKIRKXXXX\n\nAgain,  there was a pause, this time a little longer.  Now,  from\nhis room, he was talking to a computer in Los Angeles.  There was\nanother  menu  of options, and a list of other  widely  dispersed\ncomputer  networks. He requested the SUNYNET computer, the  State\nUniversity of New York Network.  From there, he asked the comput-\ner  for a local phone line so he could dial into a very  private,\nvery secret computer called NEMO.\n\nIt  took Steve a grand total of 45 seconds to access NEMO in  New\nYork, all at the price of a local phone call.\n\nNEMO  was  a  private BBS that was restricted to  an  elite  few.\nThose who qualifications and reputations allowed them entry  into\nthe  exclusive domain of hacking.  NEMO was born into this  world\nby Steve and a few of his friends while they were in high  school\nin Darien.  NEMO was a private club, for a few close friends  who\nenjoyed their new hobby, computers.\n\nNEMO's Menu was designed for the professional hacker.\n\n     1. PASSWORDS\n     2. NEW NETS\n     3. DANGER ZONES\n     4. CRACKING TOOLS\n     5. WHO'S NEW?\n     6. PHREAKING\n     7. CRYPTO\n     8. WHO ELSE?\n     9. U.S. NETWORKS\n     10. INTERNATIONAL NETWORKS\n     11. FOR TRADE\n     12. FORTUNE 500 DOORKEYS\n\nHe selected (8), WHO ELSE?  Steve wanted to see who else was 'on-\nline' now.  He wanted to talk about this Chase guy who was giving\nhackers a bad name. The computer responded:\n\nCONVERSATION PIT: LA CREME,  RAMBO.   DO YOU WANT TO JOIN IN?\n\nThat  was  great! Two of the half dozen of NEMO's  founders  were\nthere.  La Creme de la Creme was KIRK's college roommate, but  he\nhad  not  yet returned to San Diego for the  fall  term.   RAMBO,\n'I'll  get through any door' was the same age as Kirk and  Creme,\nbut  chose  to study at Columbia in New York's  Harlem.   Hackers\npicked  alter-  ego monikers as CB'ers on the  highways  did;  to\nproject  the  desired image. Steve and his cohorts  picked  their\naliases when they were only fifteen, and kept them ever since.\n\nSteve typed in a 'Y' and the ENTER key.\n\n     WHO ARE YOU?\n\nNEMO was asking for an additional password.\n\nKirk\n\nSteve  typed.   A brief pause, and the computer  screen  came  to\nlife.\n\nWELCOME TO THE CONVERSATION PIT, KIRK.  HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?\n\nThat  was  his  invitation  to  interrupt  any  conversation   in\nprogress. Steve typed in,\n\nDudes!\n\nHOW'D EXAMS GO? <<LA CREME>>\n\nGreased'em.  Ready to come back?\n\nFAST  AS  THE PLANE WILL GO.  PICK ME UP?  7:20  ON  AMERICAN?<LA\nCREME>\n\nSure.  Hey, what's with the Morris copy cat?  Some phreak blowing\nit for the rest of us.\n\nSO YOU HEARD.  CHASE IS REALLY GONNA SCREW THINGS UP. <<RAMBO>>\n\nWhat  the hell really happened?  I read the Times.  Said that  he\nclaimed it was accident.\n\nACCIDENTAL ON PURPOSE MAYBE  <<LA CREME>>\n\nHOW  MANY WAYS ARE THERE INFECT A NATIONAL DEFENSE NETWORK?   ONE\nTHAT I KNOW OF.  YOU PUT THE VIRUS IN THERE.  THAT'S NO ACCIDENT.\n<<RAMBO>>\n\nTen-Four.   Seems like he don't wanna live by the code.  Must  be\nsome spoiled little brat getting too big for his britches . . .\n\nBEST GUESS IS THAT HE DID IT TO IMPRESS HIS OLD MAN.  HE  SUPPOS-\nEDLY  CREATED AN ANTIDOTE, TOO. HE WANTED TO SET OFF A BIG  VIRUS\nSCARE  AND  THEN  LOOK LIKE A HERO WITH A FAST  FIX.   THE  VIRUS\nWORKED ALL TOO WELL.  THE ANTIDOTE, IF THERE WAS ONE, SUCKED.  SO\nINTERNET HAD GAS SO BAD, COMPUTING CAME TO A HALT FOR A COUPLE OF\nDAYS TILL THEY CLEANED  OUT THE PROVERBIAL SEWERS.  <<LA CREME>>\n\nSURE SOUNDS LIKE A PUBLICITY GAG TO ME <<RAMBO>>\n\nJeez.  Anyone else been hit yet?\n\nNO, BUT WE'VE BEEN EXTRA CAREFUL SINCE.  A LOT OF DOORS HAVE BEEN\nCLOSED SO  IT'S BACK TO SQUARE ONE ON A BUNCH, BUT WE DIDN'T LOSE\nEVERYTHING.  THE DOORKEY DOWNLOAD WILL UPDATE YOU.  <<RAMBO>>\n\nOK, I'll be supersleuth.  Any word on CHAOS? Legion of Doom,  The\nCrusaders?\n\nIT'S  ONE BIG DEAL IN THE E-MAIL:  NEW CHAOS VIRUSES, EVERY  DICK\nAND JANE IS WRITING THEIR OWN VIRUSES.  COMPUTING WITH AIDS.\n\nFunny.  Why don't you put a rubber on your big 640K RAM?  Or your\nmouse?\n\nGOT  SOMETHING AGAINST SAFE COMPUTING?  IF HALF OF WHAT THEY  SAY\nIS TRUE, WE'RE ALL IN TROUBLE.  TAKE A LOOK AT THE PUBLIC  BBS'S.\nQUITE A CHAT.  <<LA CREME>>\n\nWill  do.  Any word on the new Central Census Data Base?   Every-\nthing about every American stored in one computer.  All of  their\npersonal  data,  ripe for the picking.  Sounds like the  kind  of\nlibrary that would do the bad guys a lot of good.\n\nCAN'T  FIND A DOOR FROM THE INTERNET GATE. THE JUSTICE  LINK  WAS\nSTILL GOOD YESTERDAY AND THE FBI STILL HASN'T CHANGED A PASSWORD,\nSO  THAT  SHOULD  BE AN EASY OPEN ONCE WE FIND  THE  FRONT  DOOR.\nGIMME A COUPLE OF DAYS AND WE SHOULD KNOW DAN QUAYLES' JOCK SIZE.\n<<RAMBO>>\n\nZero! Ha! Keep me in mind.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSteve copied several pages of names, phone numbers and  passwords\nfrom  NEMO's  data base into his computer 3000 miles  across  the\ncountry.  These were the most valuable and revered types of files\nin  the underground world of hackerdom.  They include all of  the\ninformation needed to enter and play havoc inside of hundreds  of\nsecret and private computers.\n\n          National Institute of Health        301-555-6761\n     USER: Fillstein          PASSWORD: Daddy1\n     USER: Miller9            PASSWORD: Secret\n               VMS 1.01\n               SUPERUSER: B645_DICKY\n\n          VTEK NAS, Pensacola, Fla            904-555-2113\n     USER: Major101       PASSWORD: Secret\n     USER: General22      PASSWORD: Secret1\n     USER: Forestall      PASSWORD: PDQS\n\n          IBM, Armonk, Advanced Research\u000f     914-555-0965\n     USER: Port1\u000f     PASSWORD: Scientist\n     USER: Port2      PASSWORD: Scientist\n     USER: Port3          PASSWORD: Scientist\n\nThere were seventeen pages of updated and illegal access codes to\ncomputer  systems across the country. Another reason NEMO was  so\nsecret.   Didn't  want just anybody climbing the walls  of  their\nprivate playground.  Can't trust everyone to live by the Code.\n\nSteve  finished  downloading the files from NEMO's  distant  data\nbase and proceeded to print them out for a hardcopy reference. He\nlaughed  to himself.  Big business and government  never  wizened\nup.   Predictable passwords, like 'secret' were about as  kinder-\ngarten as you could get.  And everyone wonders why folks like  us\nparade  around  their computers.  He had in his hand  a  list  of\nover 250 updated and verified private, government and educational\ninstitutions  who had left the keys to the front doors  of  their\ncomputers wide open.  And those were just the ones that NEMO knew\nabout today.\n\nThere is no accurate way to determine how many groups  of hackers\nlike  NEMO  existed.  But, even if only 1/100 of 1%  of  computer\nusers classified themselves as hackers, that's well over  100,000\npeople breaking into computers.  Enough reason to give Big  Busi-\nness cause for concern. Yet, no one did anything serious to  lock\nthe doors.\n\nSteve  spent the next several hours walking right  into  computer\nsystems all over the country.  Through the Bank of California  in\nSan Francisco, (Steve's first long distance call) he could  reach\nthe  computers of several corresponding banks.  He  read  through\nthe new loan files, saw that various developers had defaulted  on\ntheir  loans  and were in serious trouble.  Rates were  going  to\nstart rising.  Good enough for a warm up.\n\nSteve still wanted back into the NASA launch computers.  On  line\nlaunch information, results of analysis going back twenty  years,\nand  he  had  had a taste of it, once.  Then,  one  day,  someone\ninside  of NASA got smart and properly locked the front door.  He\nand  NEMO  were  ever on the search for a key  back  into  NASA's\ncomputers.\n\nHe figured that Livermore was still a good bet to get into  NASA.\nThat  only meant a local call, through the SDSU/BBS to Cal   Tech\nthen into Livermore.  From San Diego, to LA, to San Francisco for\na mere 25 cents.\n\nLivermore  researchers  kept the front doors of  their  computers\nalmost  completely open.  Most of the workers, the graduate  stu-\ndents,  preferred  a  free exchange of  information  between  all\nscientists,  so their computer security was extraordinarily  lax.\nFor  a weapons research laboratory, funded by the  Department  of\nEnergy, it was a most incongruous situation.\n\nMuch of the information in the Livermore computers was considered\nsensitive  but unclassified, whatever that meant  in  government-\nspeak, but for an undergraduate engineering major cum hacker,  it\nwas great reading.  The leading thinkers from the most technical-\nly  demanding areas in science today put down their thoughts  for\nthe  everyone  to  read.  The Livermore  scientists  believed  in\nfreedom of information, so nearly everyone who wanted in, got in.\nTo the obvious consternation and dismay of Livermore  management.\nAnd its funding agency.\n\nSteve  poked  around  the Livermore computers  for  a  while  and\nlearned  that SDI funding was in more serious jeopardy than  pub-\nlicly  acknowledged.  He discovered that the last  3  underground\nnuclear test explosions outside of Las Vegas were underyield, and\nno  one knew why.  Then he found some  super-technical  proposals\nthat sounded like pure science fiction:\n\nMoving  small asteroids from between Mars and Jupiter into  orbit\naround  the Earth would make lovely weapons to drop on your  ene-\nmies.  War mongers.\n\nAll  of this fascinating information, available to anyone with  a\ncomputer and a little chutzbah.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAlexander  Spiradon had picked Sir George and his other  subjects\ncarefully, as he had been trained to do.\n\nHe  had  spent the better part of twenty years working  for  West\nGerman   Military  Intelligence,  Reichenbunnestrad   Dunnernecht\nDeutchelande,  making less money than he required to live in  the\nstyle  he  desired.  To supplement his  income,  he  occasionally\nperformed extracurricular activities for special interest  groups\nthroughout  Europe.  A little information to the IRA in  Northern\nIreland,  a warning to the Red Brigade about an  impending  raid.\nEven the Hizballah, the Party of God for Lebanese terrorists  had\noccasion  to use Alex's Services.  Nothing that would  compromise\nhis  country, he rationalized, just a little help to the  various\npolitical factions that have become an annoyance to their respec-\ntive governments.\n\nAlex  suddenly  resigned  in 1984 when he  had  collected  enough\nfreelance fees to support his habits, but he was unaware that his\nown agency had had him under surveillance for years, waiting  for\nhim  to slip up.  He hadn't, and with predictable German  Govern-\nment  efficiency, upon his departure from the RDD, his  file  was\npromptly retired and his subsequent activities ignored.\n\nAlex  began  his full time free-lance  career as a  'Provider  of\nInformation'.  With fees of no less than 250,000 DM, Alex  didn't\nneed  to work much.  He could pick and choose his clients  as  he\nweighed  the  risks and benefits of  each  potential  assignment.\nWith his network of intelligence contacts from Scotland Yard,  Le\nSurite, and the Mossad, he had access to the kind of  information\nthat terrorists pay for dearly .\n\nIt was a good living.  No guns, no danger, just information.\n\nHis latest client guaranteed Alex three years of work for a  flat\nfee  in  the millions of Deutch Marks.  It was  the  intelligence\nassignment  of a lifetime, one that insured a peaceful and  pros-\nperous retirement for Alex.  He wasn't the perennial spy, politi-\ncally or dogmatically motivated.  Alex wanted the money.\n\nAfter  he  had completed his computer classes and  purchased  the\nequipment from the list, Sir George dialed the number he had been\ngiven.  He half expected a live person  to congratulate him,  but\nalso realized that that was a foolish wish.  There was no  reason\nto  expect  anything  other than the same  sexy  voice  dictating\norders to him.\n\n\"Ah, Sir George.  How good of you to call.  How were your  class-\nes?\"   George nearly answered the alluring telephone  personality\nagain, but he caught himself.\n\n\"Very good,\" the voice came back in anticipated response. \"Please\nget a pencil and paper. I have a message for you in 15  seconds.\"\nThat damned infernal patronization.  Of course I have a  bleeding\npen.  Not a pencil.  Idiot.\n\n\"Are  you ready?\"  she asked.  George made an obscene gesture  at\nthe phone.\n\n\"Catch a flight to San Francisco tonight.  Bring all of  the com-\nputer equipment you have purchased. Take a taxi to 14  Sutherland\nPlace on Knob Hill.  Under the mat to Apartment 12G you will find\ntwo keys.  They will let you into your new living quarters.  Make\nyourself  at home. It is yours, and the rent is taken care of  as\nis the phone bill.  Your new phone number is 4-1-5-5-5-5-6-3-6-1.\nWhen you get settled, dial the following number from your comput-\ner.   You should be well acquainted with how to do that  by  now.\nThe number is  4-1-5-5-5-5-0-0-1-5.  Your password is  A-G-O-R-A.\nUnder  the  mattress in the bedroom is a PRG,  Password  Response\nGenerator.   It looks like a credit card, but has an eight  digit\ndisplay.  Whenever you call Alex, he will ask you for a  response\nto  your password.  Quickly enter whatever the PRG says.  If  you\nlose  the PRG, you will be terminated.\"  The voice paused  for  a\nfew seconds to George's relief.\n\n\"You will receive full instructions at that point.  Good Bye.\"  A\ndial  tone replaced the voice he had come to both love and  hate.\nBloody hell, he thought.  I'm down to less than $5000 and now I'm\ngoing back to San Francisco? What kind of bleedin' game is this?\n\nApartment 12G was a lavish 2 bedroom condominium with a drop dead\nview of San Francisco and bodies of water water in 3  directions.\nFurnished in high tech modern, it offered every possible amenity;\nbar,  jacuzzi, telephone in the bathroom and full channel  cable.\nSome job.  But, he kept wondering to himself, when does the  free\nride end?  Maybe he's been strung along so far that he can't  let\ngo.  One more call, just to see how the next chapter begins.\n\nGeorge  installed his computer in the second bedroom on  a  table\nthat fit his equipment like a glove.\n\n          C:\\cd XTALK\n          C:\\XTALK\\xtalk\n\nHis  hard  disk  whirred for a few seconds.  He  chose  the  Dial\noption  and entered the phone number from the keyboard  and  then\nasked the computer to remember it for future use.  He omitted the\narea code.  Why had he been given an area code  if he was dialing\nfrom the same one?  George didn't pursue the question; if he  had\nhe would have realized he wasn't alone.\n\nThe modem dialed the number for him.  His screen went momentarily\nblank and then suddenly came to life again.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECT 2400 BAUD>>>>>>\n     DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO ALEX? (Y/N?)\n\nGeorge entered a \"Y\"\n\n     PASSWORD:\n\nGeorge  entered AGORA.   The letters did not echo to the  screen.\nHe hoped he had typed then correctly.  Apparently he did, for the\nscreen then prompted him for his RESPONSE.\n\nHe copied the 8 characters from the PRG into the computer.  There\nwas a pause and then the screen filled.\n\nSIR GEORGE,\n\nWELCOME TO ALEX. IT IS SO GOOD TO SPEAK  TO YOU AGAIN.\n\nOVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS YOU WILL BE GIVEN NAMES AND  NUMBERS\nTO CALL.  THERE ARE VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS AND STATEMENTS TO  BE\nMADE TO EACH PERSON YOU CALL.  THERE IS TO BE NO DEVIATION  WHAT-\nSOEVER.  I  REPEAT, NO DEVIATION WHATSOEVER.  IF THERE  IS,  YOUR\nSERVICES WILL BE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED. WE HOPE THAT WILL NOT BE\nNECESSARY.\n\nEACH  MORNING  YOU ARE TO DIAL ALEX AND REQUEST THE  FILE  CALLED\nSG.DAT.   DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT ATTEMPT TO ACCESS OR  DOWNLOAD\nANY OTHER FILES, OR YOU WILL BE TERMINATED AT ONCE.\n\nFOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS IN EACH FILE, EXACTLY.  KEEP AN EXACT LOG\nOF THE EVENTS AS THEY TRANSPIRE  ON EACH CALL.\n\n          <<PUSH SPACE BAR FOR MORE>>\n\nGeorge pushed the space bar.  The screen was again filled.\n\nALEX REQUIRES PRECISE INFORMATION.  WHATEVER YOU ARE TOLD BY  THE\nPEOPLE YOU CALL MUST BE RELAYED , TO THE LETTER.\n\nAT  THE  END  OF EACH DAY, YOU ARE TO UPLOAD  YOUR  FILE,  CALLED\nSG.TOD.   YOUR  COMPUTER WILL AUTOMATICALLY PUT A DATE  AND  TIME\nSTAMP ON IT.\n\nTHEN, USING NORTON UTILITY, ERASE THE SG.DAT FILE FROM THAT  DAY.\nIF  YOU  ARE UNABLE TO REACH ANYONE ON THE LISTS,  JUST  INDICATE\nTHAT  IN YOUR DAILY REPORTS. DO NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT  TRY TO  CALL\nTHE SAME PERSON THE NEXT DAY. IS THAT CLEAR?\n\nThe screen was awaiting a response.  George typed in \"Y\".\n\nGOOD.  THIS IS QUITE SIMPLE, IS IT NOT?\n\nY\n\nDO YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE THE JOB?\n\nY\n\nWHAT KIND OF PRINTER DO YOU HAVE?\n\nNone\n\nARE YOU SURE?\n\nY\n\nWILL YOU BUY ONE?\n\nN\n\nGOOD.  ARE YOU INTERESTED IN MONEY?\n\nFinally, thought Sir George, the reason for my existence.\n\nY\n\nAN  ACCOUNT HAS BEEN OPENED IN YOUR NAME AT THE BANK OF  AMERICA,\nREDMOND BRANCH 3 BLOCKS FROM YOU. THERE IS  $25,000 IN IT.   EACH\nMONTH  OF SUCCESSFUL WORK FOR ALEX WILL BE REWARDED WITH  ANOTHER\nPAYMENT.  U.S. TAXES ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.  IS THAT A PROBLEM?\n\nN\n\nWILL  YOU DISCUSS YOUR JOB OR ITS NATURE WITH ANYONE?  ANYONE  AT\nALL?\n\nN\n\nEVEN UNDER FORCE?\n\nForce,  what the hell does that mean?  I guess the answer is  No,\nthought George.\n\nN\n\nI  HOPE  SO,  FOR YOUR SAKE.  GOOD LUCK SIR  GEORGE.   YOU  START\nMONDAY.\n\n          <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\nSir  George was a little confused, maybe a lot confused.  He  was\nthe proud owner of a remote control job, a cushy one as far as he\ncould tell, but the tone of the conversation he just had with the\ncomputer  was worrisome. Was he being threatened?  What  was  the\ndifference between 'Services Terminated' and 'Terminated' anyway.\nMaybe he shouldn't ask.  Keep his mouth shut and do a good job.\n\nHey, he thought, dismissing the possible unpleasant  consequences\nof  failure.  This is San Francisco, and I have a three days  off\nin  a  new city.  Might as well find my way around the  town  to-\nnight.  According to the guide books I should start at Pier 39.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 3\n\n     Tuesday, September 8,\n     New York City\n\nBut they told me they wouldn't tell! They promised.\" Hugh Sidneys\npleaded into his side of the phone.  \"How did you find out?\"   At\nfirst, Scott thought the cartoon voice was a joke perpetrated  by\none  of  his friends, or more probably, his ex-wife.   Even  she,\nthough,  coudn't possibly think crank a phone call was a  twisted\nform of art.  No, it had to be real.\n\n\"I'm  sorry Mr. Sidneys.  We can't give out our sources.   That's\nconfidential.   But  are you saying that you confirm  the  story?\nThat it is true?\"\n\n\"Yes, no.  Well ,\" the pleading slid into near sobbing.  \"If this\ngets  out, I'm ruined.  Ruined.  Everything, my family .  .  .how\ncould  you have found out?  They promised!\"  The noise  from  the\nbusy  metro room at the New York City Times made it difficult  to\nhear Sidneys.\n\n\"Can  I  quote you, sir?  Are you confirming  the  story?\"  Scott\npressed  on for that last requisite piece of  every  journalistic\npuzzle  confirmation  of  a story that stood to  wreck  havoc  in\nportions  of the financial community.  And Washington. It  was  a\nstory  with  meat,  but Scott Mason needed  the  confirmation  to\ncomplete it.\n\n\"I don't know. . .if I tell what I know now, then maybe . . .that\nwould  mean  I  was  being helpful . .  .maybe  I  should  get  a\nlawyer  . . .\"  The call from Scott Mason to First State  Savings\nand Loan on Madison Avenue had been devastating. Hugh Sidneys was\njust doing what he was told to do.  Following orders.\n\n\"Maybe,  Hugh.  Maybe.\"  Scott softened toward Sidneys,  thinking\nthe first name approach might work.  \"But, is it true, Hugh?   Is\nthe story true?\"\n\n\"It  doesn't  matter anymore.  Do what you want.\"   Hugh  Sidneys\nhung up on Mason.  It was as close to a confirmation as he  need-\ned.  He wrote the story.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAt  39,  Scott Byron Mason was already into  his  second  career.\nDespite the objections of his overbearing father, he had  avoided\nthe  family  destiny of becoming a longshoreman.  \"If  it's  good\nenough for me, it's good enough for my kids.\"  Scott was an  only\nchild,  but his father had wanted more despite his mother's  ina-\nbility to carry another baby to full term.\n\nScott caught the resentment of his father and the doting  protec-\ntion of his mother.  Marie Elizabeth Mason wanted her son to have\nmore  of a future than to merely live another generation  in  the\nlower  middle  class doldrums of Sheepshead Bay,  Brooklyn.   Not\nthat Scott was aware of his predicament; he was a dreamer.\n\nHer son showed aptitude.  By the age of six Scott knew two  words\nhis father never learned - how and why.  His childhood  curiosity\nled to more than a few mishaps and spankings by the hot  tempered\nLouis Horace Mason.  Scott took apart everything in the house  in\nan  attempt  to  see what made it  tick.   Sometimes,  not  often\nenough, Scott could reassemble what he broken down to its  small-\nest  components.  Despite his failings and bruised  bottom  Scott\nwasn't satisfied with, \"that's just the way it is,\" as an  answer\nto anything.\n\nBehind  his  father's  back, Marie had Scott take  tests  and  be\naccepted to the elite Bronx High School of Science, an hour and a\nhalf train ride from Brooklyn.  To Scott it wasn't an escape from\nBrooklyn, it was a chance to learn why and how machines worked.\n\nHorace  gave Marie and Scott a three day silent  treatment  until\nhis  mother  finally put an end to it.  \"Horace  Stipton  Mason,\"\nEvelyn  Mason said with maternal command.  \"Our son has  a  gift,\nand  you  will  not, I repeat, you will not  interfere  with  his\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"Yes dear.\"\n\n\"The  boy  is thirteen and he has plenty of time to  decide  what\nhe's going to do with himself.  Is that clear?\"\n\n\"Yes dear.\"\n\n\"Good.\" She would say as she finished setting the table.  \"Dinner\nis ready.  Wash your hands boys.\"  And the subject was closed.\n\nBut throughout his four years at the best damn high school in the\ncountry,  Horace found ample opportunity to pressure Scott  about\nhow it was the right thing to follow in the family tradition, and\nwork at the docks, like the three generations before him.\n\nThe  issue  was never settled during Scott's  rebellious  teenage\nyears.   The War, demonstrating on the White House lawn,  getting\ngassed at George Washington, writing for the New York Free Press,\nScott was even arrested once or twice or three times for peaceful\ncivil  disobedience.  Scott Mason was seeing the world in  a  new\nway.   He  was rapidly growing up, as did much of  the  class  of\n1970.\n\nScott's grades weren't good enough for scholorships, but adequate\nto be accepted at several reasonable schools.\n\n\"I already paid for his education,\" screamed Horace upon  hearing\nthat  Scott chose City College to keep costs down. He would  live\nat home.  \"He broke every damn thing I ever bought, radios, TV's,\nwashers. He can go to work like a man.\"\n\nWith his mother's blessing and understanding, Scott moved out  of\nthe  house  and in with three roommates who  also  attended  City\nCollege,  where all New Yorkers can get a free education.   Scott\nplayed very hard, studied very little and let his left of  center\npolitics  guide  his  social life.   His  engineering  professors\nremarked  that  he was underutilizing his God-given  talents  and\nthat  he  spent more time protesting and  objecting  that  paying\nattention.   It  was an unpredictable piece of  luck  that  Scott\nMason would never have to make a living as an engineer.  He would\nbe able to remain the itinerate tinkerer; designing and  building\nthe most inane creations that regularly had little purpose beyond\nsatisfying technical creativity.\n\n\"Can we go with it?\" Scott asked City Editor Douglas McQuire  and\nJohn Higgins, the City Times' staff attorney whose job it was  to\nanswer just such questions.  McQuire and Mason had been asked  to\njoin Higgins and publisher Anne Manchester to review the  paper's\nposition on running Mason's story.  Scott was being lawyered, the\nrelatively  impersonal cross examination by a so-called  friendly\nin-house attorney.  It was the single biggest pain in the ass  of\nScott's job, and since he had a knack for finding sensitive  sub-\njects,  he was lawyered fairly frequently.  Not that it made  him\nfeel  any less like being called to the principal's office  every\ntime.\n\nScott's boyish enthusiasm for his work, and his youthful  appear-\nance  allowed some to underestimate his ability.  He looked  much\nyounger than his years, measuring a slender 6  foot tall and  shy\nof  160  pounds. His longish thin sandy hair and a  timeless  all\nabout  Beach Boy face made him a good catch on his  better  days-\nhe  was back in circulation at almost 40.  The round wire  rimmed\nglasses  he donned for an extreme case of myopia were  a  visible\nstylized reminder of his early rebel days, conveying a  sophisti-\ncated air of radicalism. Basically clean cut, he preferred  shav-\ning every two or three, or occasionally four days. He blamed  his\npoor  shaving habits on his transparent and sensitive skin  'just\nlike Dick Nixon's'.\n\nThe four sat in Higgins' comfortable dark paneled office. With  2\nwalls full of books and generous seating, the ample office resem-\nbled  an  elegant and subdued law library.  Higgins  chaired  the\nmeeting  from behind his leather trimmed desk.  Scott  brought  a\ntall  stack  of  files and put them on the  glass  topped  coffee\ntable.\n\n\"We need to go over every bit, from the beginning.  OK?\"  Higgins\nmade  it sound more like and order than responsible  journalistic\ndouble checking.  Higgins didn't interfere in the news end of the\nbusiness; he kept his opinions to himself. But it was his respon-\nsibility to insure that the City Times' was  kept out of the  re-\nceiving  end  of any litigation.   That meant that as long  as  a\nstory  was properly researched, sourced, and confirmed, the  con-\ntents were immaterial  to him.  That was  the Publisher's choice,\nnot his.\n\nMason had come to trust Higgins in his role as aggravating media-\ntor  between news and business. Scott might not like what he  had\nto  say, but he respected his opinion and didn't argue too  much.\nHiggins was never purposefully adversarial.  He merely wanted  to\nknow that both the writers and the newspaper had all  their ducks\nin  a  row.  Just in case.  Libel suits can be such a  pain,  and\nexpensive.\n\n\"Why don't you tell me, again, about how you found out about  the\nMcMillan  scams.\"  Higgins turned on a small  micro-cassette  re-\ncorder.  \"I hope you don't mind,\" he said as he tested it. \"Keeps\nbetter  notes than I do,\" he offhandedly said.  Nobody  objected.\nThere would have been no point in objecting even if anyone cared.\nIt  was an unspoken truism that Higgins and other good  attorneys\ntaped many of their unofficial depositions to protect  themselves\nin  case anything went terribly wrong.  With a newspaper as  your\nsole client, the First Amendment was always at stake.\n\n\"OK,\"  Scott began.  His reporter's notebook sat atop files  full\nof computer printouts.   \"A few days ago, on September 4,  that's\na Friday, I got an anonymous call.  The guy said, 'You want  some\ndirt on McMillan and First State S&L?'  I said sure, what do  you\nhave and who  is this?\"\n\n\"So  then you knew who Francis McMillan was?\" Higgins  looked  up\nsurprised.\n\n\"Of  course,\" Mason said. \"He's the squeaky clean bank  President\nfrom  White Plains.  Says he knows how to clean up the S&L  mess,\ngets  lots  of air time. Probably making a play  for  Washington.\nBig time political ambitions. Pretty well connected at  Treasury.\nI guess they listen to him.\"\n\n\"In a nutshell.\"  Higgins agreed. \"And . . .then?\"\n\nMason sped through a couple of pages of scribbled notes from  his\npad.  \"My  notes start here.  'Who I am don't matter but  what  I\ngotta  say does. You interested'.  Heavy Brooklyn accent,  docks,\nItalian,  who knows.  I said something like, 'I'm listening'  and\nhe  says  that McMillan is the dirtiest of them all.   He's  been\nsocking more money away than the rest and he's been doing it real\nsmart.   So  I go, 'so?' and he says he can prove it  and  I  say\n'how'  and  he  says 'read your morning  mail'.\"   Mason  stopped\nabruptly.\n\n\"That's it?\" Higgins asked.\n\n\"He hung up.  So  I forgot about it till the next morning.\"\n\n\"And  that's  when you got these?\" Higgins said pointing  at  the\nstack  of  computer printouts in front of Mason. \"How  were  they\ndelivered?\"\n\n\"By  messenger.  No receipt, nothing.  Just my name and  the  pa-\nper's.\" Mason showed Higgins the envelop in which the files came.\n\n\"Then you read them?\"\n\n\"Well not all of them, but enough.\" Scott glanced at his  editor.\n\"That's when I let Doug know what I had.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"  Higgins was keeping furious notes to back\nup the tape recording.\n\n\"'Holy  shit', as I remember.\"  Everyone laughed.  Ice  breakers,\ngood  for  the  soul, thought Mason.   People  are  too  uptight.\nHiggins indicated that Scott should continue.\n\n\"Then  he said 'we gotta go slow on this one,' then  he  whistled\nand Holy Shat some more.\"  Once the giggles died down, Mason  got\nserious.  \"I borrowed a bean counter from the basement, told  him\nI'd  put  his  name in the paper if anything came of  it,  and  I\npicked his brain.  Ran through the numbers on the printouts,  and\nran  through  them  again.  I really worked that  poor  guy,  but\nthat's the price of fame.  By the next morning we knew that there\nwere  two sets of books on First State.\"  Mason turned  a  couple\npages in his files.\n\n\"It  appears,\"  Scott said remembering that he  was  selling  the\nimportance  of  the  story to legal and the  publisher,  \"that  a\nsubstantial portion of the bank's assets are located in  numbered\nbank accounts all over the world.\"  Scott said with finality.\n\nHiggins interrupted here.  \"So what's wrong with that?\" he  chal-\nlenged.\n\n\"They've effectively stolen a sandbagged and inflated reserve ac-\ncount  with over $750 Million it.  Almost 10% of  stated  assets.\nIt  appears from these papers,\" Scott waved his hand  over  them,\n\"that the total of the reserve accounts will be taken, as a loss,\nin  their next SEC reporting.\"  Mason stopped and looked at  Hig-\ngins as though Higgins would understand everything.\n\nHiggins snorted as he made more notes.\n\n\"That  next  morning,\" Mason politely ignored Higgins, \"I  got  a\ncall again, from what sounded like the same guy.\"\n\n\"Why do you say that? How did you know?\"  Higgins inquired.\n\nMason sighed.  \"Cause he said, 'it's me remember?' and spoke like\nArchie  Bunker.  Good enough for you?\" Mason grinned wide.  Mason\nhad  the accent down to a tee.  Higgins gave in to another  round\nof snickers.\n\n\"He  said, 'you like, eh?'\" Mason spoke with an  exaggerated  New\nYork  accent and  used the appropriate Italian hand  gesture  for\n'eh!'.   \"I  said, 'I like, but so what?'  I still  wasn't   sure\nwhat he wanted.  He said, 'they never took a loss, yet.  Look for\nFriday.  This Friday. They're gonna lose a bunch.' I  said,  'how\nmuch' and he said, 'youse already know.'\"  Mason's imitation of a\nBrooklyn accent was good enough for a laugh.\n\n\"He  then  said, 'enjoy the next installment', and that  was  the\nlast  time  I spoke to him.  At any rate, the next  package  con-\ntained  a history of financial transactions, primarily  overseas;\nLuxembourg,  Lietchenstein,  Switzerland,  Austria,  Hong   Kong,\nSidney,  Macao,  Caymans and such.  They show a  history  of  bad\nloans and write downs on First State revenues.\n\n\"Well,  I grabbed the Beanie from the Basement and  said, help me\nwith  these now, and I got research to come up with the 10K's  on\nFirst State since 1980  when McMillan took over.  And the results\nwere  incredible.\"  Mason held out a couple of charts  and   some\ngraphs.\n\n\"We  compared both sets of books.  The bottom lines on  both  are\nthe  same.  First State has been doing very well.   McMillan  has\ngrown  the  company from $1 Billion to $12 Billion in  8   years.\nQuite  a  job, and the envy of hundreds of every other  S&L  knee\ndeep  in their own shit.\"  Higgins cringed. He thought  Ms.  Man-\nchester  should be shielded from such language.  \"The problem  is\nthat, according to one set of books, First State is losing  money\non some investments merely by wishing them away.  They  disappear\naltogether from one report to the next.  Not a lot of money,  but\na few million here and there.\"\n\n\"What have you got then?\" Higgins pressed.\n\n\"Nobody notices cause the losses are all within the limits of the\nloss  projections and reserve accounts. Sweet and  neat!  Million\ndollar embezzlement scam with the SEC's approval.\"\n\n\"How  much follow up did you do?\"  Higgins asked as his  pen  fly\nacross the legal pad.\n\n\"Due to superior reporting ability,\" Scott puffed up his chest in\njest,  \"I  found that a good many account numbers listed  in  the\npackage  I received are non-existent.  But, with a  little  prod-\nding,  I did get someone to admit that one of them  was  recently\nclosed and the funds moved elsewhere.\n\n\"Then,  this  is the clincher, as the caller promised,  today,  I\nlooked for the First State SEC reports, and damned if the numbers\ndidn't  jive.  The books with the overseas accounts are the  ones\nwith  the  real losses and where they occur.   The  'real'  books\ndon't.\"\n\n\"The bottom line, please.\"\n\n\"Someone  has been embezzling from First State, and when  they're\nthrough it'll be $3 Billion worth.\"  Scott was proud of  himself.\nIn only a few days he had penetrated a huge scam in the works.\n\n \"You can't prove it!\" Higgins declared.  \"Where's the proof? All\nyou have is some unsolicited papers where someone has been  play-\ning a very unusual and admittedly questionable game of 'what if'.\nYou have a voice on the end of a phone with no name, no  nothing,\nand  a so-called confirmation from some mid-level  accountant  at\nthe bank who dribbles on about 'having to do it' but never saying\nwhat 'it' is.  So what does that prove?\"\n\n\"It  proves that McMillan is a fraud, a rip-off,\" Scott  retorted\nconfidently.\n\n\"It does not!\"\n\n\"But  I have the papers to prove it,\" Scott shuffled through  the\nfolders.\n\n\"Let  me explain something, Scott.\" Higgins put down his pen  and\nadapted a friendlier tone.  \"There's a little legal issue  called\nright  to  privacy.  Let me ask you this.  If I came to  you  and\nsaid that Doug here was a crook, what would you do?\"\n\n\"Ask you to prove it,\" Scott said.\n\n\"Exactly.  It's the same here.\"\n\n\"But I have the papers to prove it,  it's in black and white.\"\n\n\"No Scott, you don't.  What you have is some papers with  accusa-\ntions.   They're  unsubstantiated.  They could have  easily  been\nphonied.  You know what computers can do better than I  do.   Now\nhere's the key point.  Everybody in this country is due  privacy.\nYou don't know where these came from, or how they were  obtained,\ndo you?\"\n\n\"No,\" Scott hesitantly admitted.\n\n\"So, someone's privacy has been compromised, in this case  McMil-\nlan's.    If, and I'm saying, if, these reports are  accurate,  I\nwould take the position that they are stolen, obtained illegally.\nIf  we publish with what we  have now, the paper could be on  the\nreceiving  end of a slander and libel suit that could put us  out\nof  business.   We even could be named as a co-conspirator  in  a\ncriminal suit.  I can't let that happen.  It's our obligation  to\nguarantee responsible journalism.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Scott didn't agree.\n\n\"Scott,  you're good, real good, but you have to see it from  the\npaper's  perspective.\" Higgins' tone was now conciliatory.  \"This\nis  hard stuff, and there's just not enough here, not to go  with\nit  yet.  Maybe in a few days when you can get a little  more  to\ntie it up.  Not now.  I'm sorry.\"\n\nCase closed.\n\nShit, shit shit, thought Scott.  Back to square one.\n\nHugh Sidneys was nondescript, not quite a nebbish, but close.  At\nfive  foot  five with wisps of brown scattered over  his  balding\npate,  he only lacked horn rimmed glasses to complete the  image.\nHis bargain basement suits almost fit him, and he scurried rather\nthan  walked down the hallways at First  State Savings  and  Loan\nwhere  he  had been employed since graduating from  SUNY  with  a\ndegree in accounting twenty four years ago.\n\nHis  large ears accentuated the oddish look, not entirely out  of\nplace on the subways at New York rush hour.  His loyalty to First\nState  was  known throughout the financial  departments;  he  was\nalmost  a fixture.  His accounting skills were extremely  strong,\neven remarkable if you will, but his personality and  appearance,\nand that preposterous cartoon voice, held him back from advancing\nup the official corporate ladder.\n\nNow, though, Hugh Sidneys was scared.\n\nHe needed to do something . . .and having never been in this kind\nof    predicament   before   .   .   .he   thought   about    the\nlawyer . . .hiring one like he told that reporter . . .but  could\nhe afford that . . .and he wasn't sure what to do . . .was he  in\ntrouble?  Yes, he was . . .he knew that.  That reporter .  .  .he\nsounded  like he understood . . .maybe he could help . . .he  was\njust asking questions . . .what was his name . . .?\n\n\"Ah,  Mr. Mason?\" Scott heard the timid man's Road  Runner  voice\nspoke gently over the phone. Scott had just returned to his  desk\nfrom  Higgins'  office.  It was after 6P.M. and time to  catch  a\ntrain back home to Westchester.\n\n\"This is Scott Mason.\"\n\n\"Do you remember me?\"\n\nScott recognized the voice immediately but said nothing.\n\n\"We     spoke    earlier    about    First    State,    and     I\njust  . . .ah . . .wanted to . . .ah . . .apologize . . .for  the\nway I acted.\"\n\nScott's confirmation.  Hugh Sidneys, the Pee Wee Herman  sounding\nbeancounter from First State. What did he want?\n\n\"Yes,  of course, Mr. Sidneys.  How can I help you?\"   He  opened\nhis notebook. He had just had his story nixed and he was ready to\ngo home.  But Sidneys . . .maybe . . .\n\n\"It's just that, well, I'm nervous about this . . .\"\n\n\"No  need  to apologize, Hugh.\" Scott smiled into  the  phone  to\nconvey  sincerity. \"I understand, it happens all the time.   What\ncan I do for you tonight?\"\n\n\"Well,  I,  ah, thought that we might, maybe you  could,  well  I\ndon't  know  about help, help, it's so much and I  didn't  really\nknow, no I shouldn't have called . . .I'm sorry . . .\" The  pitch\nof Sidneys' voice rose as rambled on.\n\n\"Wait! Don't hang up.  Mr. Sidneys.  Mr. Sidneys?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the whisper came over the earpiece.\n\n\"Is there something wrong . . .are you all right?\"  The fear, the\nsound  of fear that every good reporter is attuned to  came  over\nloud and clear.  This man was terrified.\n\n\"Yes, I'm OK, so far.\"\n\n\"Good.   Now,  tell me, what's wrong.  Slowly  and  calmly.\"   He\neased Sidneys off his panic perch.\n\nScott  heard Sidneys compose himself and gather up the  nerve  to\nspeak.\n\n\"Isn't there some sorta rule,\" he stuttered, \"a law, that says if\nI talk to you, you're a reporter, and if I say that I don't  want\nyou  to tell anybody, then you can't?\"  Sidneys was  scared,  but\nwanted to talk to someone.  Maybe this was the time for Scott  to\nback off a little.   He stretched out and put his feet up on  his\ndesk,  making  him feel and sound more relaxed,  less  pressured.\nAccording  to Scott, he generated more Alpha waves in  his  brain\nand  if  wanted  to convey calm on the phone, he  merely  had  to\nassume the position.\n\n\"That's called off the record, Hugh.  And it's not a law.\"  Scott\nwas  amused  at the naivete that Hugh Sidneys  showed.   \"It's  a\ngentleman's  agreement, a code of ethics in journalism.  You  can\nbe  off  the record, on the record, or for  background,  not  for\nattribution,  for  confirmation, there's a whole bunch  of  'em.\"\nScott  realized  that  Hugh knew nothing about the  press  so  he\nexplained the options slowly.  \"Which one would you like?\"  Scott\nwanted  it  to seem that Sidneys was in control  and  making  the\nrules.\n\n\"How  about  we  just  talk,  and  you  tell  me  what  I  should\ndo . . .what you think . . .and . . .I don't want anything in the\npaper.   You have one for that?\"  Hugh was feeling easier on  the\nphone with  Scott.\n\n\"Sure do.  We'll just call it off the record for now.  Everything\nyou  tell  me, I promise not to use it without  your  permission.\nWill that do?\" Scott smiled broadly.  If you speak loudly with  a\nbig  smile  on your face, people on the other end  of  the  phone\nthink  you're honest and that you mean what you say.  That's  how\ngame show hosts do it.\n\n\"OK.\"   Scott heard Sidneys inhale deeply. \"Those papers you  say\nyou have?  Remember?\"\n\n\"Sure  do.  Got them right here.\" Scott patted them on his  clut-\ntered desk.\n\n\"Well, you can't have them.  Or you shouldn't have them.  I  mean\nit's  impossible.\"   Hugh was getting nervous again.   His  voice\nnearly squeaked.\n\n\"Hugh,  I  do have them, and you all but confirmed  that  for  me\nyesterday.   A weak confirmation, but I think you know more  than\nyou let on . . .\"\n\n\"Mr. Mason . . .\"\n\n\"Please, call me Scott!\"\n\n\"OK . . .Scott.  What I'm trying to say is that what you say  you\nhave, you can't have cause it never existed.\"\n\n\"What  do you mean never existed?\"  Scott was confused,  terribly\nconfused  all  of sudden.  He raised his voice. \"Listen,  I  have\nreams  of  paper here that say someone at First State  is  a  big\ncrook.  Then you say, 'sure it's real' and now you don't.  What's\nyour  game, Mister?\"  Playing good-cop bad-cop alone  was  diffi-\ncult, but a little pressure may bring this guy down to reality.\n\n\"Obviously you have them, that's not the point.\"  Sidneys reacted\nsubmissively  to  Scott's ersatz domineering  personality.   \"The\nonly place that those figures ever existed was in my mind and  in\nmy  computer.  I never made a printout.  They were never  put  on\npaper.\"  Hugh said resolutely.\n\nScott's mind whirred.  Something is wrong with this picture.   He\nhas  papers that were never printed, or so says a guy whose  sta-\nbility  is  currently in question.  The contents would  have  far\nreaching  effects on the S&L issue.  A highly visible tip of  the\niceberg.   McMillan, involved in that kind of thing?  Never,  not\nMr. Clean.  What was Sidneys getting at?\n\n\"Mr.  Sidneys . . .Hugh . . .do you have time to have a  cup   of\ncoffee  somewhere.   It might be easier if we sat face  to  face.\nGet to know each other.\"\n\nRosie's Diner was one of the better Greasy Spoons near the Hudson\nRiver  docks on Manhattan's West Side.  The silver  interior  and\nexterior  was not a cliche when this diner was built. Rosie,  all\n280  pounds  of her, kept the UPS truckers coming back  for  over\nthirty  years.   A lot of the staff at the paper ate  here,  too.\nFor  the  best tasting cholesterol in New York,  saturated  fats,\nbacon  and  sausage  grease flavored starches,  Rosie's  was  the\nplace.  Once a month at Rosie's would guarantee a reading of over\n300.\n\nScott  recognized  Hugh from a distance.  No one  came  in  there\ndressed.   Had  to be an accountant.  Hugh hugged  his  briefcase\nwhile nervously looking around the diner. Scott called the  short\npale  man over to the faded white formica and dull chrome  booth.\nHugh ordered a glass of water, while Scott tried to make a  light\ndinner of it.\n\n\"So, Hugh,  please continue with what you were telling me on  the\nphone.\"  Scott tried to sound empathetic.\n\n\"It's  like I said, I don't know how you got them or  they  found\nout.   It's  impossible.\"  The voice was uncannily  like  Pebbles\nFlintstone in person.\n\n\"Who found out?  Does someone else know . . .?\"\n\n\"OK,\" Hugh sighed.  \"I work for First State, right? I work  right\nwith McMillan although nobody except a few people know it.   They\nthink  I do market analysis and research.  What I'm really  doing\nis helping shelter money in offshore investment accounts.   There\nare  some tax benefits, I'm not a tax accountant so I don't  know\nthe reasons, but I manage the offshore investments.\"\n\n\"Did you think that was illegal?\"\n\n\"Only a little.  Until recently that is.\"\n\n\"Sorry, continue.\"  Scott nibbled from the sandwich on his plate.\n\n\"Well  there  was  only one set of books to  track  the  offshore\ninvestments.   They  wanted them to be kept  secret  for  various\nreasons.  McMillan and the others made the deals, not me. I  just\nmoved the money for them.\" Again Hugh was feeling paranoid.\n\n\"Hugh,   you moved some money around illegally, maybe.  So  what?\nWhat's  the  big deal?\"  Scott gulped some hot  black  coffee  to\nchase the pastrami that almost went down the wrong pipe.\n\nSidneys  continued after sipping his water and wetting his  lips.\n\"Four  days  ago I got this call, from some  Englishman  who  I'd\nnever spoken to before.  He said he has all the same figures  and\nfacts  you said you have.  He starts reading enough to me  and  I\nknow  he's got what he says he got.  Then he says he wants me  to\ncooperate  or he'll go public with everything and blow  it  right\nout of the water.\"  Hugh was perspiring with tension.  His  fists\nwere clenched and knuckles white.\n\n\"And then, I called you and you came unglued. Right?\"  Scott  was\ntrying to emotionally console Hugh, at least enough to get  some-\nthing  more.  \"Do you think you were being blackmailed?  Did  he,\nthe  English guy, demand  anything? Money? Bribes?  Sex?\"   Scott\ngrinned.  Hugh obviously did not appreciate the attempt at  levi-\nty.\n\n\"No,  nothing.  He just said that I would hear from him  shortly.\nThat  was it. Then, nothing, until you called.  Then I figured  I\nmissed his call.\"  Hugh was working himself into another  nervous\nfrenzy.\n\n\"Did he threaten you?\"\n\n\"No. Not directly.  Just said  that it would be in my best inter-\nest to  cooperate.\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"What could I say?  I mumbled something about doing nothing wrong\nbut  he said that didn't matter and I would be blamed for  every-\nthing and that he could prove it.\"\n\n\"Could  he prove it?\" Hugh was scribbling furiously in his  note-\nbook.\n\n\"If  he had the files in my computer I guess I would look  pretty\nguilty,   but there's no way anyone could get in there.  I'm  the\nonly  one, other than McMillan who can get at that  stuff.   It's\nalways  been a big secret.  We don't even make any  printouts  of\nit.   It's never on paper, just in the computer.\" Hugh fell  back\nin  the thinly stuffed torn red Naugahyde bench seat  and  gulped\nfrom his water glass.\n\nScott shook his head as he scanned the notes he had been  making.\nThis  didn't make any sense at all.  Here was this  little  nerdy\nman,  with a convoluted tale of embezzlement and  blackmail,  off\nshore money and he was scared.  \"Hugh,\" Scott began slowly.  \"Let\nme  see  if I've got this right.  You were part of  a  scheme  to\nshift investments overseas, falsify reports, yet the  investments\nalways  made a reasonable return in investment.\"  Hugh nodded  in\nagreement silently.\n\n\"Then,  after  how many, eight years of this, creating  a  secret\nlittle world that only you and McMillan know about . . .\"\n\n\"A few others knew, I have the names, but only McMillan could get\nthe  information from the computer. No one else could.  I set  it\nup that way on purpose.\" Hugh interrupted.\n\n\"OK,  then you receive a call from some Englishman who says  he's\ngot  the numbers you say are so safe and then I get a copy.   And\nthe numbers agree with the results that First State reported.  Is\nthat about it?\" Scott asked, almost mocking the apparent  absurd-\nity.\n\n\"Yeah,  that's   it.  That's  what happened.\"  Hugh  Sidneys  was\nsuch a meek man.\n\n\"That  leaves me with a couple of possible conclusions. One,  you\ngot  yourself  in  over your head, finally decided  to  cut  your\nlosses  and  make up this incredible story.   Maybe make  a  deal\nwith  the cops or the Feds and try to be hero.  Maybe you're  the\nembezzler  and want out before  it's too late.  Born again  bean-\ncounter.  It's  a real possibility.\"  Hugh's face  grimaced;  no,\nthat's not what happened, it's just as I told you.\n\"Or,  two, McMillan is behind the disclosures and is  now  effec-\ntively sabotaging his own plans.  For what reasons I could hardly\nventure a guess now.  But,  if what you are saying is true,  it's\neither you or McMillan.\"  Scott liked the analysis. It was  sound\nand  took  into account all available information,  omitting  any\nspeculation.\n\n\"Then why would someone want to threaten me?\n\n\"Either you never got the call,\" the implication was obvious, \"or\nMcMillan is trying, quite effectively to spook you.\" Scott put  a\nfew dollars on the table next to the check.\n\n\"That's  it?   You won't say anything, will you?  You  promised!\"\nHugh leaned into Scott, very close.\n\nScott consoled Hugh with a pat on his wrinkled suit sleeve.  \"Not\nwithout  speaking  to you first. No, that  wouldn't  be  cricket.\nDon't worry, I'll call you in a couple of days.\"\n\nHis  editor,  Doug McGuire agreed that Scott should keep  on  it.\nThere might be a story there, somewhere.  Go find it.  But  don't\nforget about the viruses.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe  headline  of the National Expos\u001b\u0002\n, a  weekly  tabloid  caught\nScott's  attention on his way home that evening in Grand  Central\nStation.\n\n          EXCLUSIVE!  S&L RIP OFF EXPOSED!\n\nScott's  entire story, the one he wasn't permitted to  print  was\nbeing  read  by  millions of  mid-American  supermarket  shopping\nhousewives.  In its typically sensationalistic manner, the  arti-\ncle  claimed   that  the Expose was in  exclusive  possession  of\ndocuments that proved McMillan was stealing 10's of millions from\nFirst  State  S&L.  It even printed a fuzzy picture of  the  same\npapers that Scott had received.  How the hell?\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 4\n\n     Thursday, September 10\n     Houston, Texas.\n\nAngela Steinem dialed extension 4343, Network Administration  for\nMIS  at  the Treadline Oil Company in Houston,  Texas.   It  rang\nthree  times before Joan Appleby answered. Joan was  the  daytime\nnetwork administrator for Building 4.   Hundreds of IBM  personal\ncomputers were connected together so they could share information\nover a Novell local area network.\n\n\"Joan, I don't bug you much, right?\"  Angela said hesitantly.\n\n\"Angela, how about a good morning girl?\"  They were good  friends\noutside of work but had very little business contact.\n\n\"Sorry, mornin'.  Joan, I gotta problem.\"\n\n\"What's  troubling  ya hon.\"  Joan Texas spoke  with  a  distinct\nTexas twang.\n\n\"A little bird just ate my computer.\"\n\n\"Well, then I guess I'd be lookin' out for Big Bird's data dump.\"\nJoan laughed in appreciation of the comedy.\n\n\"No  really.  A little bird flew all over my computer and ate  up\nall the letters and words on the screen. Seriously.\"\n\n\"Y'all are putting me on, right?\"  Maggie's voice lilted.\n\n\"No.  No, I'm serious.  It was like a simple video game,  Pac-Man\nor something, ate up the screen.  I couldn't get it to come  back\nso I turned my computer off and now it won't do anything. All  it\nsays is COMMAND.COM cannot be found. Now, what the hell does that\nmean.\"\n\nJoan  Appleby  now took Angela seriously.  \"It may mean  that  we\nhave some mighty sick computers.  I'll be right there.\"\n\nBy the end of work, the Treadline Oil Company was essentially  at\na  standstill.   Over  4,000 of  their  internal  microcomputers,\nmainly  IBM and Compaq's were out of commission.  The  virus  had\nsuccessfully struck.\n\nAngela  Steinem  and her technicians shut down the more  than  50\nlocal  area  networks  and gateways that  connected  the  various\nbusiness  units.   They  contacted the  National  Computer  Virus\nAssociation  in San Mateo, California, NIST's  National  Computer\nCenter  Laboratories and a dozen or so other watchdog groups  who\nmonitor computer viruses.\n\nThis  was a new virus.  No one had seen it before.   Sorry,  they\nsaid.  If you can send us you hard disk, we may be able find  out\nwhat's going on . . .otherwise, your best bet is to dismantle the\nentire  computer system, all 4,000 plus of them, and  start  from\nscratch.\n\nAngela informed the Vice President of Information Systems that it\nwould  be at least a week, maybe ten days before Treadline  would\nbe fully operational again.\n\nMary  Wallstone,  secretary to Larry Gompers,  Junior  democratic\nrepresentative from South Carolina was stymied.\n\nEvery  morning  between 7:30 and 8:00 AM she  opened  her  boss's\noffice  and  made coffee.  Most mornings she brought  in  Dunkin'\nDonuts.   It was the only way she knew to insure that her  weight\nwould  never ebb below 200 pounds.  Her pleasant silken skin  did\nnot match the plumpness below.  At 28 she should have known  that\nmeeting  Washington's best and brightest required a more  slender\nphysique.\n\nThis morning she jovially sat down at her Apple Macintosh comput-\ner  with 3 creme filled donuts and a mug of black coffee  with  4\nsugars.   She turned on the power switch and waited as the  hour-\nglass icon indicated that the computer was booting. It was  going\nthrough  its  self  diagnostics as it did every  time  power  was\napplied.\n\nNormally, after a few seconds, the Mac  would come alive and  the\nscreen would display a wide range of options from which she could\nselect.  Mary would watch the procedure carefully each time - she\nwas an efficient secretary.\n\nThis  time, however, the screen displayed a new message, one  she\nhad  not  seen in the nine months she had worked  as  Congressman\nGompers' front line.\n\n     RAM OPTIMIZER TEST PROCEDURE....\n\n     INITIALIZING...\n\nTHIS  PROGRAM  IS DESIGNED TO TAKE MAXIMUM  ADVANTAGE  OF  SYSTEM\nSTORAGE CAPABILITIES.  THE TEST WILL ONLY TAKE A FEW SECONDS...\n\n     WAITING....\n\n     WARNING:  DO NOT TURN OFF COMPUTER DURING SELF TEST!\n\nAs she was trained, she heeded her computer's instructions.   She\nwatched  and  waited  as the computer's  hard  disk  whirred  and\nbuzzed.  She  wasn't familiar with the message,  but  it  sounded\nquite official, and after all, the computer is always right.\n\nAnd  she waited. Some few seconds, she thought, as she dove  into\nher  second  donut.  And she waited through the third  donut  and\nanother mug of too sweet coffee.\n\nShe  waited nearly a half an hour, trying to oblige the  instruc-\ntions  from the technocratic box on her desk.  The Mac  continued\nto  work, so she thought, but the screen didn't budge  from  it's\nwarning message.\n\nWhat  the  hell, this has taken long enough.  What  harm  can  it\ncause if . . .\n\nShe turned the power switch off and then back on.  Nothing.\n\nThe computer did absolutely nothing.  The power light was on, the\ndisk light was on, but the screen was as blank as a dead  televi-\nsion set.\n\nMary  called Violet Beecham, a co worker in another  office  down\nthe hall.\n\n\"'Morning Vi.  Mary.\"\n\nViolet sounded agitated.  \"Yeah, Mare, what is it?\"\n\n\"I'm being a dumb bunny and need a hand with my computer.  Got  a\nsec?\"  Mary's sweetness oozed over the phone.\n\n\"You,  too?  You're having trouble?  My computer's as dead  as  a\ndoornail.   Won't  do  anything.  I mean  nothing.\"   Violet  was\nfrustrated as all get out and the concern communicated to Mary.\n\n\"Dead? Vi, mine is dead too.  What happened to yours?\"\n\n\"Damned  if I know.  It was doing some self check  or  something,\nseemed to take forever and then . . .nothing.  What about yours?\"\n\n\"Same thing.  Have you called MIS yet?\"\n\n\"Not  yet,  but I'm getting ready to.  I never  did  trust  these\nthings.  Give me a typewriter any day.\"\n\n\"Sure Vi.  I'll call you right back.\"\n\nMary  looked up the number for MIS Services, the technical  magi-\ncians  in the basement who keep the 3100 Congressional  computers\nalive.\n\n\"Dave here,  can I help you?\"  The voice spoke quickly and indif-\nferently.\n\n\"Mary  Wallstone,  in Gompers  office.  My computer seems  to  be\nhaving  a little problem . . .\"  Mary tried to treat the  problem\nlightly.\n\n\"You and half of Congress.  Listen . . .is it Mary?  This morning\nis going to be a slow one.  My best guess is that over 2500  com-\nputers died a quick death.  And you know what that mean.\"\n\n\"No, I don't...\" Mary said hesitantly.\n\n\"It means a Big Mac Attack.\"\n\n\"A what?\"\n\n\"Big  Mac, it's a computer  virus.   We thought  that  Virus-Stop\nsoftware  would  stop it, but I guess there's a  new  strain  out\nthere.  Congress is going to be ordering a lot of typewriters and\nlegal pads for a while.\"\n\n\"You mean you can't fix it?  This virus?\"\n\n\"Listen, it's like getting the flu.  Once you got it, you got it.\nYou can't pretend you aren't sick.  Somebody took a good shot  at\nCongress  and  well  . . .they won.  We're gonna be  down  for  a\nwhile.   Couple of weeks at least.  Look, good luck, but I  gotta\ngo.\"  Dave hung up.\n\nMary ate the other three donuts intended for her boss as she  sat\nidle at her desk wondering if she would have a job now that there\nwere no more computers on Capitol Hill.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     CONGRESS CATCHES FLU - LOSES FAT IN PROCESS\n     by Scott Mason, New York City Times\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office announced late yesterday that  it\nwas requesting over $1 Million in emergency funding to counter  a\ndevastating failure of Congress's computers.\n\nMost  of the computers used by both Senators and  Representatives\nare Apple Macintosh, but Apple Computer issued a quick  statement\ndenying  any  connection  between the massive  failures  and  any\nproduction problems in their machines.\n\nThe CBO said that until the problems were corrected, estimates to\ntake up to four weeks, that certain normal Congressional  activi-\nties would be halted or severely curtailed.  Electronic mail,  E-\nMail  that has saved taxpayers millions, will be unavailable  for\ncommunications until October at a minimum.  Inter-office communi-\ncations,  those that address legislative issues, proposed  bills,\nand  amendments have been destroyed and will require \". .  .weeks\nand  weeks  and  weeks of data entry just to get  back  where  we\nstarted.  This is a disaster.\"\n\nThe  culprit  is, of course, a computer virus.  The  question  on\neveryone's mind is, was this virus directed at Congress, or  were\nthey merely an anonymous and unfortunate victim?\n\nI  have an IBM PC clone at home.  Technically it's an AT  with  a\nhard  disk, so I'm not sure if that's an XT, and AXT, an XAT,  an\nATX or . . .well whatever.  I use it to write a lot of my stories\nand  then  I can send the story to the computer at  work  for  an\noverdiligent editor to make it fit within my allotted space.\n\nIt never occurred to me that a computer could get sick.\n\nI  am,  as we all are, used to our 'TV going on  the  Fritz',  or\n'Blowing a Fuse'.  It seems like a lot of  things blow: a  gasket\nblows,  a light bulb blows, a tire blows or blows out,  the  wind\nblows.  I am sure that Thomas W. Crapper, the 19th century inven-\ntor of the flush toilet would not be pleased that in 1988 man has\ntoasters  and other cooking devices that 'crap out'.   The  Phone\nCompany 'screws up', the stock market 'goes to hell in a handbas-\nket'  and VCR's 'work for s__t'.\n\nIt never occurred to me that a computer could get sick.\n\nComputers  are supposed to 'crash'.  That means that either  Aunt\nTillie  can't  find the ON switch or her cat knocked  it  on  the\nfloor.  Computers have 'fatal errors' which obviously means  that\nthey died and deserve a proper burial.\n\nIt never occurred to me that a computer could get sick.\n\nIn  the  last few weeks there have been a lot  of  stories  about\ncomputers across the country getting ill.  Sick, having the  flu,\nbreathing  difficulty, getting rashes, itching, scratching  them-\nselves . . .otherwise having a miserable time.\n\nLet's  look at the medical analogy to the dreaded computer  virus\nthat  indiscriminately  attacks and destroys  any  computer  with\nwhich it comes in contact.\n\nSomewhere  in  the  depths of the countryside   of  the  People's\nRepublic of China, a naturally mutated submicroscopic microbe has\nthe nerve to be aerodynamically transferred to the smoggy air  of\nTaiwan.   Upon landing in Taipei, the microbe attaches itself  to\nan impoverished octogenarian who lives in an overpopulated 1 room\napartment over a fish store.\n\nThe  microbe works its way into this guy's blood  stream,  unbek-\nnownst  to him, and in a few days, he's sicker than a  dog.   But\nthis microbe is smart, real smart.  It has heard of  antibiotics,\nand in the spirit of true Darwinism, it replicates itself  before\nbeing  killed off  with a strengthened immunity. So, the  microbe\ncopies  itself and when Kimmy Chen shakes hands with his  custom-\ners, some of them are lucky enough to receive an exact duplicate,\nclone if you will, of his microbe.  Then they too, get ill.\n\nThe  microbe  thus propagates its species until the  entire  East\nCoast of the US has billions and trillions of identical  microbes\ncosting  our fragile economy untold millions of dollars  in  sick\npay.\n\nHowever,  the microbe is only so smart.  After a while,  the  mi-\ncrobe  mutates  itself into a benign chemical  compound  that  no\nlonger can copy itself and the influenza epidemic is over.  Until\nnext  year when Asian Flu B shows up and the process  begins  all\nover  again.  (The same group of extremists who believe that  the\nTri-Lateral  commission  runs the world and Queen  Elizabeth  and\nHenry  Kissinger are partners in the heroine trade think the  AMA\nis behind all modern flu epidemics. No comment.)\n\nThe point of all of this diatribe is that computers can get  sick\ntoo. With a virus.\n\nDon't  worry, mom.  Your computer can't give you the flu  anymore\nthan  your fish can get feline leukemia.\n\nIt all started years ago, before Wozniak and Apple and the PC.\n\nBefore personal computers there were mainframes; huge room  sized\ncomputers to crunch on numbers.  One day, years ago, Joe, (that's\nnot a real name, it's changed to protect him) decided it would be\ngreat fun to play a prank on Bill, another programmer who  worked\nat a big university.  Joe wrote a little program that he put into\nBill's big computer.  Every time Bill typed the word 'ME' on  his\nkeyboard,  the computer would take over.  His video screen  would\nfill up with the word 'YOU', repeating itself hundreds and  thou-\nsands of times.  Bill's computer would become useless.\n\nThat  was called a practical joke to computer  programmers.   Joe\nand Bill both got a laugh out of it, and no harm was done.   Then\nBill  decided  to get back at Joe.  He put a small  program  into\nJoe's big computer.  Every day at precisely 3:00 P.M., a  message\nappeared: 'Do Not Pass GO!'.\n\nIt  was all good fun and became a personal challenge to  Joe  and\nBill to see how they could annoy each other.\n\nWord  spread about the new game.  Other graduate students at  the\nuniversity got involved and soon computer folks at Cal Tech, MIT,\nCarnegie  Mellon, Stanford and elsewhere got onto the  bandwagon.\nThus was born the world's first computer disease, the virus.\n\nThis is Scott Mason. Using a typewriter.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     November, 3 Years Ago\n     Sunnyvale, California.\n\nWhen Data Graphics Inc. went public in 1987, President and found-\ner  Pierre  Troubleaux,  a nationalized American  born  in  Paris\nmomentarily  forgot  that  he had sold his soul  to  achieve  his\nsuccess.   The company, to the financial community known as  DGI,\nwas on the road to being in as much favor as Lotus or  Microsoft.\nAnnual sales of  $300 Million with a pre-tax bottom line of  over\n$55 Million were cause celebre on Wall Street.  The first  public\nissues  raised over $200 Million for less than 20% of the  common\nstock.   With a book value in excess of $1  Billion,  preparation\nfor a second offering began immediately after the first sold  out\nin 2 hours.\n\nThe  offering made Pierre Troubleaux, at 29, a rich man;  a  very\nrich man.  He netted almost $20 Million in cash and another  $100\nMillion in options over 5 years.  No one objected.  He had earned\nit.   DGI  was the pearl of the computer industry in  a  time  of\nshake  ups  and shake outs.  Raging profits,   unbridled  growth,\nphenomenal market penetration and superb management.\n\nPerhaps  the most  unique feature of DGI,  other than its  Presi-\ndent's deal with the devil, was that it was a one product  compa-\nny.   DGI was somewhat like Microsoft in that they both got  rich\nand famous on one product.  While Microsoft branched out from DOS\ninto  other  product areas, DGI elected to remain  a  1   product\ncompany  and  merely make flavors of its products  available  for\nother  companies which then private labeled them under their  own\nnames.\n\nTheir software product was dubbed dGraph, a marketing abbreviated\nterm for data-Graphics. Simply put, dGraph let users,  especially\nnovices,  run their computers with pictures and icons instead  of\ncomplex  commands  that  must be remembered  and  typed.   dGraph\ntheoretically  made IBM computers as easy to use as a  Macintosh.\nOr, the computer could be trained to follow instructions in plain\nEnglish.  It was a significant breakthrough for the industry.\n\nDGraph was so easy to use,  and so powerful in its abilities that\nit  was  virtually  an instant success.   Almost  every  computer\nmanufacturer  offered dGraph as part of its standard fare.   Just\nas  a  computer needed DOS to function, it was  viewed  that  you\nneeded dGraph before you even loaded the first program.   Operat-\ning  without  dGraph  was considered  archaic.  \"You  don't  have\ndGraph?\"   \"How  can you use your computer without  dGraph?\"   \"I\ncouldn't live without dGraph.\"  \"I'd be lost without dGraph.\"\n\nThe ubiquitous non-technical secretaries especially loved dGraph.\nDGraph  was taught at schools such as Katherine Gibbs and  Secre-\nTemps  who insisted that all its  girls  were fluent in  its  ad-\nvanced uses. You just can't run a office without it!\n\nAs  much  as anything in the computer industry is, dGraph  was  a\nstandard.   Pierre Troubleaux was unfortunately under the  misim-\npression that the success for DGI was his and his alone and  that\nhe too was a standard . . .a fixture.  The  press  and  computers\nexperts portrayed to the public that he was the company's  singu-\nlar genius, with remarkable technical aptitude to see \"beyond the\nproblem to the solution . . .\".\n\nThe  official  DGI  biography of Pierre  Troubleaux,  upon  close\nexamination,  reads  like that of an inflated resume by a  person\napplying  for a position totally outside his field of  expertise.\nCompletely   unsuited for the job.  But the media hype had  rele-\ngated that minor inconsistency to old news.\n\nIn  reality  Troubleaux was a musician.  He was  an  accomplished\npianist  who also played another twenty instruments,  very,  very\nwell.  By the age of ten he was considered something of a prodigy\nand  his parents decided that they would move from Paris  to  New\nYork, the United States, for proper schooling.  Pierre's scholar-\nships at Julliard made the decision even easier.\n\nOver the years Pierre excelled in performances and was critically\nacclaimed as having a magnificent future where he could call  the\nshots.  As a performer or composer.  But Pierre had other  ideas.\nHe  was  rapt  in the study of the theory of  music.   How  notes\nrelated  to each other.  How scales related to each other.   What\nmade  certain atonalities subjectively pleasing yet  others  com-\npletely offensive.  He explored the relationships between Eastern\npolyphonic  scales and the Western twelve note  scale.   Discord,\nharmony,  melody, emotional responses; these were the true  loves\nof Pierre Troubleaux.\n\nUpon   graduation from Julliard he announced,  that  contrary  to\nhis family's belief and desire, he would not seek advanced train-\ning. Rather, he would continue his study of musical relationships\nwhich by now had become an obsession. There was little  expertise\nin  this  specific area, so he pursued it alone.   He  wrote  and\narranged music only to provide him with enough funds to exist  in\nhis pallid Soho loft in downtown Manhattan.\n\nHe  believed  that there was an inherent underlying  Natural  Law\nthat  guided  music and musical appreciation.  If he  could  find\nthat  Law,  he would have the formula for  making  perfect  music\nevery  time.   With the Law at  the crux of all music,  and  with\ncontrol  over the Law, he ruminated, one could write  a   musical\npiece  to  suit the specific goals of the writer and  create  the\ndesired effect on the listener.  By formula.\n\nIn 1980 Pierre struggled to organize the unwieldy amount of  data\nhe  had  accumulated.  His collections  of  interpretive  musical\nanalysis  filled file cabinets and countless shelves.  He  relied\non  his  memory to find anything in the reams of paper,  and  the\nsituation was getting  out of control.  He needed a solution.\n\nMax  Jones was a casual acquaintance that Pierre had met  at  the\nLone  Star Cafe on the corner of 13th and 5th Avenue.   The  Lone\nStar was a New York fixture, capped with a 60 foot iguana on  the\nroof.  They both enjoyed the live country acts that played there.\nMax played the roll of an Urban Cowboy who had temporarily  given\nup  Acid  Rock in favor of shit kickin'  Southern  Rock.   Pierre\nfound the musical phenomenon of Country Crossover Music  intrigu-\ning,  so he rationalized that drinking and partying at  the  Lone\nStar  was  a worthwhile endeavor which contributed to  his  work.\nThat may have been partially true.\n\nMax  was  a  computer jock who worked for one of  the  Big  Eight\naccounting firms in midtown Manhattan. A complex mixture of  com-\nputer junkie, rock'n'roll aficionado and recreational drug  user,\nMax maintained the integrity of large and small computer  systems\nto pay the bills.\n\n\"That  means  they pretend to pay me and I pretend  to  work.   I\ndon't really do anything productive.\"\n\nMax was an \"ex-hippie who put on shoes to make a living\"  and   a\nsocial  anarchist at heart.  At 27, Max had the rugged look  that\nJohn  Travolta popularized in the 70's but on a rock  solid  trim\nsix foot five 240 pound frame. He dwarfed Pierre's mere five feet\nten inches.\n\nPierre's  classic  European good looks and  tailored  appearance,\neven  in  jeans  and a T-shirt were a strong  contrast  to  Max's\nruddiness.   Pierre's jet black hair was side parted and  covered\nmost of his ears as it gracefully tickled his shoulders.\n\nPiercing  black eyes stared over a prominent Roman nose and  thin\ncheeks which tapered in an almost feminine chin.  There was never\nany confusion, though; no one in their right mind would ever view\nPierre  as anything but a confirmed and  practiced  heterosexual.\nHis  years of romantic achievements proved  it.  The remnants  of\nhis French rearing created an  unidentifiable formal and educated\naccent;  one which held incredible sex appeal to American women.\n\nMax  and Pierre sipped at their beers while Max rambled on  about\nhow  wonderful  computers were.  They were going  to  change  the\nworld.\n\n\"In a few years every one on the planet will have his own comput-\ner  and  it will be connected to everyone else's  computer.   All\ninformation will be free and the planet will be a better place to\nlive and so on . . .\"  Max's technical sermons bordered on  reli-\ngious  preaching. He had bought into the beliefs of Steven  Jobs,\nthe young charismatic founder and spiritual guiding force  behind\nApple Computer.\n\nPierre  had heard it before, especially after Max had had a  few.\nHis  view of a future world with everyone sitting in front  of  a\npicture tube playing  with numbers and more numbers . . .and then\na thought hit him.\n\n\"Max . . .Max . . .\" Pierre was trying to break into another  one\nof Max's Apple pitches.\n\n\"Yeah  .  . .oh yeah, sorry Amigo.  What's that  you  say?\"   Max\nsipped deeply on a long neck Long Star beer.\n\n\"These computers you play with . . .\"\n\n\"Not  play,  work with.  Work with!\" He pointed  emphatically  at\nnothing in particular.\n\n\"OK, work with.  Can these computers play, er, work with music?\"\n\nMax looked quizzically at Pierre. \"Music, sure.  You just program\nit  in  and  out it comes.  In fact, the Apple II  is  the  ideal\ncomputer  to  play  music.   You  can  add  a  synthesizer   chip\nand . . .\"\n\n\"What if I don't know anything about computers?\"\n\n\"Well,   that  makes  it a little harder, but why doncha  let  me\nshow you what I mean.\"  Max smiled wide.  This was what he loved,\nplaying  with  computers and talking to people about  them.   The\nsubject was still a mystery to the majority of people in 1980.\n\nPierre winced. He realized that if he took up Max on his offer he\nwould be subjected to endless hours  of computer war stories  and\ntechnical esoterica he couldn't care less about.  That may be the\nprice though, he thought.  I can always stop.\n\nOver  the  following months they became fast  friends  as  Pierre\ntutored  under Max's guiding hand.  Pierre found that  the  Apple\nhad  the ability to handle large amounts of data.  With  the  new\nprogram  called Visi-Calc, he made large charts of his music  and\ntheir numbers and examined their relationships.\n\nAs Pierre learned more about applying computers to his studies in\nmusical  theory,  his questions of Max and demands of  the  Apple\nbecame increasingly complex. One night after several beers and  a\ncouple  of joints Pierre asked Max what he thought was  a  simple\nquestion.\n\n\"How can we program the Apple so that it knows what each piece of\ndata means?\" he inquired innocently.\n\n\"You  can't  do  that, man.\" Max snorted.  \"Computers,  yes  even\nApples  are stupid.  They're just a tool.  A shovel doesn't  know\nwhat  kind  of dirt it's digging, just that  it's  digging.\"   He\nlaughed out loud at the thought of a smart shovel.\n\nPierre found the analogy worth a prolonged fit of giggles through\nwhich he managed to ask, \"but what if you told the computer  what\nit  meant  and it learned from there.  On its own.  Can't a  com-\nputer learn?\"\n\nMax was seriously stoned.  \"Sure I guess so.  Sure.  In theory it\ncould learn to do your job or mine.  I remember a story I read by\nJohn Garth.  It was called Giles Goat Boy.  Yeah, Giles Goat Boy,\nwhat  a title.  Essentially  it's about this Goat, musta  been  a\nreal smart goat cause he talked and thunk and acted like a  kid.\"\nThey  both roared at the double entendre of kid.  That was  worth\nanother joint.\n\n\"At  any   rate,\" Max tried to control  his  spasmodic  chuckles.\n\"At  any  rate, there were these two computers who  competed  for\ncontrol of the world and this kid, I mean,\"  laughing too hard to\nbreath,  \"I  mean this goat named Giles went on search  of  these\ncomputers to tell them they weren't doing a very good job.\"\n\n\"So, what has that got to do with an Apple learning,\" Pierre said\nwiping the tears from his eyes.\n\n\"Not a damn thing!\"  They entered another spasm of laughter.  \"No\nreally.   Most people either think, or like to think that a  com-\nputer can think.  But they can't, at least not like you and me. \"\nMax had calmed down.\n\n\"So?\" Pierre thought there might still be a point to this conver-\nsation.\n\n\"So, in theory, yeah, but probably not for a while.  10 years  or\nso.\"\n\n\"In theory, what?\"  Pierre asked.  He was lost.\n\n\"In theory a machine could think.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"  Pierre was disappointed.\n\n\"But,  you might be able to emulate thinking. H'mmmm.\"   Max  re-\ntreated  into mental oblivion as Abbey Road played in  the  back-\nground.   Anything from Apple records was required  listening  by\nMax.\n\n\"Emulate.   Emulate?   What's that?  Hey, Max.   What's  emulate?\nHey Max, c'mon back to Earth.  Emulate what?\"\n\nMax  jolted  back  to reality. \"Oh, copy.  You  know,  act  like.\nEmulate.  Don't they teach you emulation during sex education  in\nFrance?\"   They  both thought  that that was the  funniest  thing\never said, in any language for all of written and pre-history.\n\nThe  substance of the evening's conversation went  downhill  from\nthere.\n\nA few days later Max came by Pierre's loft.  \"I been thinking.\"\n\n\"Scary  thought.   About what?\" Pierre didn't look  up  from  his\nApple.\n\n\"About  emulating thought.  You know what we were  talking  about\nthe other night.\"\n\n\"I can't remember this morning much less getting shit faced  with\nyou the other night.\"\n\n\"You were going on and on about machines thinking.  Remember?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Pierre lied.\n\n\"Well, I've been thinking about it.\" Max had a remarkable ability\nto  recover  from  an evening of  illicit  recreation.  He  could\nactually grasp the germ of a stoned idea and let a straight  mind\ndeal  with it the following day.  \"And, I maybe got a way  to  do\nwhat you want.\"\n\n\"What do I want?\" Pierre tried to remember.\n\n\"You  want to be able to label all of your music  so that to  all\nappearances each piece of music knows about every other piece  of\nmusic. Right?\"\n\n\"Kinda,  yeah,  but you said that was impossible .  .  .\"  Pierre\ntrailed off.\n\n\"In  the true sense, yes.  Remember emulation though?   Naw,  you\nwere  too stoned.  Here's  the basic idea.\"  Max ran over to  the\nfridge,  grabbed  a beer and leapt into a bean  bag  chair.   \"We\nassign  a value to every piece  of music.  For example, in  music\nwe might assign a value to each note.  Like, what note it is, the\nlength  of  the  note, the attack and decay  are  the  raw  data.\nThat's just a number.  But the groupings of the notes are  what's\nimportant.  The groupings.  Get it?\"\n\nPierre was intrigued.  He nodded. Maybe Max did understand  after\nall. Pierre leaned forward with anticipation and listened intent-\nly,  unlike in one ear out the other treatment he  normally  gave\nMax's sermons.\n\n\"So  what  we do  is program the Apple to recognize  patterns  of\nnotes;  groupings, in any size.  We do it in pictures instead  of\nwords. Maybe a bar, maybe a scale, maybe even an entire  symphony\norchestra.  All 80 pieces at once!\"  Max's enthusiasm was  conta-\ngious.  \"As the data is put in the computer, you decide what  you\nwant to call each grouping.  You name it anything you want.  Then\nwe  could have the computer look for similar groupings and  label\nthem.   They  could all be put on a curve, some graphic  of  some\nkind, and then show how they differ and by how much.  Over  time,\nthe  computer  could learn to recognize  rock'n'roll  from  Opera\nfrom radio jingles to Elevator Music.  It's all in the  patterns.\nIsn't that what you want?\"  Max beamed while speaking  excitedly.\nHe knew he had something here.\n\nMax  and  Pierre worked together and decided to switch  from  the\nApple II computer to the new IBM  PC for technical reasons beyond\nPierre's understanding.  As they labored, Max realized that if he\ngot his \"engine\" to run, then it would be useful for hundreds  of\nother  people  who needed to relate data to each  other  but  who\ndidn't know much about computers.\n\nIn  late 1982 Max's engine came to life on its own.   Pierre  was\nprogramming  in pictures and in pure English. He was getting back\nsome incredible results.  He was finding  that many of the  popu-\nlar rock guitarists were playing lead riffs that had a  genealogy\nwhich sprang from Indian polyphonic sitar strains.\n\nHe  found curious relationships between American  Indian  rhythms\nand  Baltic sea farer's music. All the while, as Pierre  searched\nthe  reaches of the musical unknown, Max convinced  himself  that\neveryone else in the world would want his graphical engine, too.\n\nThrough  a series of contacts within his Big Eight  company,  Max\nwas put in touch with Hambrecht Quist, the famed Venture  Capital\nfirm  that  assisted such high tech startups as Apple, Lotus  and\nother  shining stars in the early days of the computer  industry.\nMax  was looking for an investor to finance the marketing of  his\nengine that would change the world.  His didactic and circumlocu-\ntous preaching didn't get him far.   While everyone was polite at\nhis presentations, afterwards they had little idea of what he was\ntalking about.\n\n\"The  Smart Engine permits anyone to cross-relate  individual  or\nmatrices  of data with an underlying attribute structure that  is\ndefined by the user.  It's like creating a third dimension.  Data\nis conventionally viewed in a two dimensional viewing field,  yet\nis  really a one dimension stream.  In either source  dimensional\nview,  the  addition of a three dimensional  attribute  structure\nyields  interrelationships that are not inherently obvious.  Thus\nwe use graphical representations to simplify the entire process.\"\n\nAfter several weeks of pounding the high risk financial community\nof  the San Francisco Bay area, Max was despondent.  Damn it,  he\nthought.   Why  don't   they understand.  I  outline  the  entire\ntheory  and  they don't get it.  Jeez, it's so easy to  use.   So\neasy to use.  Then the light bulb lit in his mind.  Call  Pierre.\nI need Pierre.  Call Pierre in New York.\n\n\"Pierre, it's Max.\"  Max sounded quite excited.\n\n\"How's the Coast.\"\n\n\"Fine, Fine. You'll find out tomorrow. You're booked on  American\n#435 tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Max, I can't go to California. I have so much work to do.\"\n\n\"Bullshit.  You owe me.  Or have I forgotten to bill you for  the\nengine?\"  He was calling in a favor.\n\n\"Hey,  it  was my idea.  You didn't even understand  what  I  was\ntalking about until . . .\"\n\n\"That's  the whole point, Pierre.  I can't explain the engine  to\nthese Harvard MBA asswipes.   It was your idea and you got me  to\nunderstand.   I just need you to get some of these  investors  to\nunderstand  and  then we can have a company and make  some  money\nselling engines.\" Max's persistence was annoying, but Pierre knew\nthat he had to give in.  He owed it to Max.\n\nThe   new presentations Max and Pierre put on went so  well  that\nthey had three offers for start up financing within a week.  And,\nit was all due to Pierre.  His genial personality and ability  to\nconvey the subtleties of a complex piece of software using actual\ndemonstrations from his music were the touchy-feely the investors\nwanted.  It wasn't that he was technical; he really wasn't.   But\nPierre had an innate ability to recognize a problem, theoretical-\nly,  and reduce it to its most basic components.  And the  Engine\nwas so  easy to use.  All you had  to do was . . .\n\nIt worked.  The brainy unintelligible technical wizard and  char-\nismatic front man.  And the device, whatever it was, it seemed to\nwork.\n\nThe  investors installed their own marketing person to get  sales\ngoing and Pierre was asked to be President.  At first he said  he\ndidn't  want  to.   He didn't know how to run  a  company.   That\ndoesn't  matter, the investors said.  You are a salable item.   A\nperson  whom  the press and future investors can relate  to.   We\nwant you to be the image of the company.  Elegance, suave,  upper\nclass. All that European crap packaged for the media.  Steve Jobs\nall over again.\n\nPierre relented, as long as he could continue his music.\n\nMax's  engine was renamed dGraph by the marketing folks  and  the\ncompany was popularly known as DGI.  Using Byte, Personal Comput-\ning,  Popular Computing and the myriad computer magazines of  the\nearly  1980's,  dGraph was made famous and used  by  all  serious\ncomputer users.\n\nDGraph  could interface with the data from other programs,  dBase\nII,  123,  Wordstar and then relate it in  ways  never  fathomed.\nAutomatically. Users could assign  their own language of, at that\ntime,  several hundred words, to describe the third dimension  of\ndata.   Or, they could do it in pictures. While the data  on  the\nscreen  was being manipulated, the computer, unbeknownst  to  the\noperator,  was  constantly  forming  and  updating  relationships\nbetween the data.   Ready to be called upon at any time.\n\nAs the ads said, \"dGraph for dData.\"\n\nAs  success reigned, the demand upon Pierre's time  increased  so\nthat he had little time for his music.  By 1986 he lived a virtu-\nal fantasy.  He was on the road, speaking, meeting with  writers,\nhaving  press  conferences every time a new use for   dGraph  was\nannounced.  He was adored by the media.  He swam in the glory  of\nthe  attention  by  the women who found  his fame  and  image  an\nirresistible  adjunct to  his now almost legendary French  accent\nand captivating  eyes.\n\nPierre  and Max were the hottest young entrepreneurs  in  Silicon\nValley; the darlings of the VC community.  And the company  spar-\nkled  too.  It was being run by professionals and Max  headed  up\nthe engineering group.  As new computers appeared on the  market,\nlike  the IBM AT, additional power could be effectively put  into\nthe  Engine  and  Voila! a new version of dGraph  would  hit  the\nmarket to the resounding ring of an Instant Hit on Softsel's  Top\n40.\n\nMax,  too,  liked  his position.  He was making a great  deal  of\nmoney, ran his own show with the casualness of his former  hippie\ndays, yet could get on the road with Pierre any time he needed  a\nbreak.   Pierre  got into the act hook, line and sinker  and  Max\nacted  the  role of genius behind 'The Man'. That  gave  Max  the\nfreedom to avoid the microscope of the press yet take a twirl  in\nthe fast lane whenever he felt the urge.\n\nThe  third  round  of funding for DGI came  from  an   unexpected\nplace.   Normally  when a company is as successful  as  DGI,  the\noriginal  investors go along for the ride.  That's how  the  VC's\nwho  worked  with  Lotus, Compaq, Apple and  other  were  getting\nfilthy  stinking  rich.  The first two rounds went  as  they  had\nplanned, the third didn't.\n\n\"Mr. Troubleaux,\" Martin Fisk, Chairman of Underwood  Investments\nsaid  to Pierre in DGI's opulent offices. \"Pierre, there is  only\none way to say this. Our organization will no longer be  involved\nwith  DGI.  We have sold our interest to a Japanese firm who  has\nbeen trying to get into the American computer field.\"\n\n\"What  will that change? Anything?\"  Pierre was nonplused by  the\nannouncement.\n\n\"Not as far as you're concerned.  Oh, they will bring in a few of\ntheir  own people, satisfy their egos and protect  their  invest-\nment,  that's entirely normal.  But, they especially want you  to\ncontinue on as President of DGI.  No, no real changes.\"\n\n\"What about Max?\" Pierre had true concern for his friend.\n\n\"He'll  remain, in his present capacity.  Essentially the  finan-\ncial people will be reporting to new owners that's all.\"\n\n\"Are we still going to go public?  That's the only way I'm  gonna\nmake any real money.\"\n\nMartin was flabbergasted.  Pierre wasn't in the least  interested\nas  to  why the company changed hands.  He only  wanted  to  know\nabout  the money, how much money he would make and when.   Pierre\nnever  bothered to ask, nor was it offered, that Underwood  would\nprofit over 400 percent on their original investment.  The  Japa-\nnese buyer was paying more than the company was worth now.   They\nhad come in offering an amount of money way beyond what an  open-\ning offer should have been.  Underwood did a search on the  Japa-\nnese  company and its American subsidiary, Data Tech.  They  were\nreal,  like  $30  Billion real and did were  expanding  into  the\ninformation  processing field through acquisitions, primarily  in\nthe United States.\n\nUnderwood sold it's 17% stake in DGI for $350 Million, more  than\ntwice its true value. They sold quickly and quietly.  Even though\nPierre  and Max should have had some say in the transfer,  Under-\nwood  controlled  the board of directors and  technically  didn't\nneed  the founder's consensus.  Not that it overtly  appeared  to\nmattered to Pierre.  Max gave the paper transfer a cursory exami-\nnation, at least asked the questions that were meaningless to the\ntransformed Pierre, and gave the deal his irrelevant blessings.\n\nAfter  the meeting with the emissaries from DGI's new owner,  OSO\nIndustries,  Pierre  and Max were confident  that  nothing  would\nchange  for them.  They would each continue in  their  respective\nroles.   The day to day interference was expected to be  minimal,\nbut  the  planned  public offering would  be  accelerated.   That\nsuited Pierre just fine; he would make out like a bandit.\n\nSeveral  days before  the date of  issue, Pierre received a  call\nfrom Tokyo.\n\n\"Mr. Troubleaux?\" The thick  Japanese accent mangled his name  so\nbadly Pierre cringed.\n\n\"Yes, this is Pierre Troubleaux,\" he said exaggerating his French\naccent.   The  Japanese  spoke French as well  as  a  hair-lipped\nstutterer  could  recite \"Peter Piper picked a  peck  of  pickled\npeppers.\"\n\n\"I wish to inform you,  sir, that the Chairman of OSO is to visit\nyour city tomorrow and participate in your new successes.   Would\nthis be convenient?\"\n\nPierre had only one possible response to the command  performance\nhe  was  being   'invited' to.  Since OSO had  bought  into  DGI,\nPierre was constantly mystified by the ritualism associated  with\nJapanese  business.  They could say \"Yes!\" a hundred times  in  a\nmeeting, yet everyone present understood that the speakers really\nmeant \"No Way, Jose!\"  There of course was the need for a quality\ngift  for  any visitor from Japan. Johnny Walker  Black  was  the\nexpected  gift over which each recipient would feign  total  sur-\nprise. Pierre had received more pearl jewelry  from the  Japanese\nthan he could use for ten wives.  But the ritual was preserved.\n\n\"Of  course  it  will.  I would be most honored.  If   you  could\nprovide  me with details of his flight I will see to it  that  he\nreceives appropriate treatment.\"\n\n\"Very good Mr. Troubleaux.\" Pierre stifled a smirk at the mispro-\nnunciation. \"Your trouble  will not go unrewarded.\"\n\n\"Mr. Homosoto, it is so good of you to visit at this time.   Very\nauspicious, sir.\"  Pierre was kissing some ass.\n\n\"Troubleaux-San,\"  Homosoto's  English  had a  touch   of  Boston\nsnobbery in it, \"you have performed admirably, and we all look to\ncontinued  successes in the future.  I expect, as I am  sure  you\ndo, that the revenues raised from your public stock offering will\nprovide  your company with the resources to grow ten  fold.\"   It\nwas a statement that demanded an answer.  Another Japanese quirk.\n\n\"Yessir, of course.  As you know, Mr. Homosoto, I am not involved\nin the day to day operations and the forecasting.  My function is\nmore  to inspire the troops and carry the standard, so to  speak.\nI will have to rely  upon the expertise of others to give you the\nexact answers you seek.\"\n\n\"That  is  not necessary, I have all I need to  know  about  your\nbusiness and its needs.  Your offer is most kind.\"\n\n\"Why  do you call DGI my business?  Aren't we in  this  together?\nPartners?\"   Pierre clarified the idiom for the rotund  bespecta-\ncled Chairman of OSO Industries.\n\n\"Hai!   Of  course, my friend, we are partners, and you  will  be\nvery  wealthy in a few days.\"  That statement had the air  of  an\naccusation  more than good wishes.  \"There is  one little  thing,\nthough. It  is so small that I don't wish to mention it.\"\n\nWell then don't, thought Pierre.  \"Nothing is so small it should-\nn't  be  mentioned.   Please, proceed Homosoto-San.   How  may  I\nhelp?\"\n\n\"That's it exactly!\"  Homosoto beamed. \"I do need your help.  Not\ntoday, but in the future, perhaps a small favor.\"\n\n\"Anytime  at all, sir.  Whatever I can I will.\"  Pierre  was  re-\nlieved.  Just some more Japanese business practices that  escaped\nhim.\n\nHomosoto  leaned in towards Pierre. His demeanor had  shifted  to\none  of  a very serious man. \"Mr. Troubleaux, how can I  be  sure\nthat you won't disappoint me?  How can I be sure?\"\n\nThe  question  threw Pierre for a loop.  How can he be  sure?   I\ndon't know.  Maybe this was only an Oriental game of mumbley  peg\nor chicken.  \"Sir, what would I need to do to convince you of  my\nwillingness to comply?\"  When in doubt, ask.\n\nHomosoto relaxed again, leaned back in the plush office chair and\nsmiled.   \"In my country, Mr., Troubleaux, honor  is  everything.\nYou  have nothing, nothing without your honor.  Every child,  man\nand woman in Japan knows that.  We are raised  with the focus  of\ngrowth  being honor.  During  the war between our  countries,  so\nmany years ago, many found honor by making the supreme sacrifice.\nKamikaze pilots are of whom I am speaking of, Mr. Troubleaux.\"\n\nPierre's  face  must  have given away the  panic  that  instantly\nstruck him. Suicide?  This guy is truly nuts.\n\n\"Do  not worry, Mr. Troubleaux, I can see what you are  thinking.\nNo.   I  only  speak of kamikaze pilots to serve  as  example  of\nhonor.   The  kind  that brought honor to Japan in  the  face  of\ndefeat.  That is something Americans will never understand.   But\nthen again you're not American are  you?\"\n\n\"I was born a Frenchman, but I naturalized over twenty years ago,\nat the same time my parents did.\"\n\n\"Ah  yes.  I remember.  Then honor does mean more to you than  to\nmost  Americans.  That will be quite good.  Now, for  the  future\nfavor.  I require nothing of you today, other than the  guarantee\nof you honor. Is that agreeable to you, Mr. Troubleaux?\"  Homoso-\nto was pushing with the facade of friendliness.  Pierre's concern\nwas  not  alleviated.  All the same, he  reluctantly  nodded  his\nassent.\n\n\"Very  good.  Now for the favor.\"  Homosoto stood up and  reached\ninside  his size 48, ill fitting suit.  Pierre was amazed at  how\nmuch  money the Japanese had, yet were apparently unable to  ever\nwear clothes that fit properly.\n\nHomosoto  handed a 5 1/4\" floppy disk to Pierre.  Pierre took  it\ncarefully  from Homosoto and looked at the label.   The  diskette\nwas marked only with:\n\n     FILE1.EXE to FILE93.EXE\n\nHe  looked inquisitively at Homosoto, his eyes asking, Yeah,  so?\nWhat's this got to do with anything?\n\n\"I see now you are confused.  It is so simple, really.   Sometime\nin the future, you will  be instructed to add one of the files on\nthis  disk onto the dGraph programs you sell. That's it. So  sim-\nple.  So I have your word Mr. Troubleaux?  Honor among men.\"\n\nPierre's mind was racing.  Put a file onto a program?  What  does\nthat  do?  What's on it?  Does it help dGraph?  No that can't  be\nit.   What  is it?  Why so secret.  What's with  the  honor  bit?\nFrom  the  Chairman of OSO, not a technician?  One  floppy  disk?\nPierre smelled a fox in the chicken coup.\n\n\"Mr.  Homosoto, sir.  I mean no disrespect.  But, I  hardly  know\nwhat  to  think.  I don't even know what this disk is.   You  are\nasking  me to promise something I don't understand.  What  if   I\ndon't  agree.   At least until I know what I'm doing? I  need  to\nknow  what's going on here.\" he said holding the disk  up  promi-\nnently.\n\n\"I prefer to think, Mr. Troubleaux of what occurs as long as  you\ndo  agree to maintain the honor between us.  It is so  much  more\npleasant.\"    Homosoto  edged towards the doors  of  Troubleaux's\noffice as he spoke.\n\n\"When  you  agree to act honorably, perform for  me  this  small,\ninsignificant favor, Mr. Troubleaux, you will get to keep the $20\nMillion you make this Friday and you will be permitted to contin-\nue living. Good Afternoon.\"  Homosoto closed the door behind him.\n\n* * * * *\n\nAlexander  Spiradon  was pleased. His students were  doing  well.\nThe other students from the New York computer school had  already\nchecked  in;  they didn't have as far to travel  as  Sir  George.\nEverything was in place, not quite a year to the day since he and\nTaki  Homosoto had set their plans in action. Alex hadn't  spoken\nto Homosoto in a couple of months.  It was now time to report  to\nHomosoto  in  Tokyo.  It was 17 hours earlier  there  -  Homosoto\nwould probably be at his desk. The modem dialed a local Brookline\nnumber.   The phone in Brookline subsequently dialed a number  in\nDallas, Texas, which dialed another phone in Tacoma,  Washington.\nThe  Tacoma  phone had the luxury of  dialing  the  international\nnumber for Homosoto's private computer.\n\nCall forwarding services offered the ultimate in protection.  Any\ntelephone tracing would take weeks, requiring the cooperation  of\ncourts  from  every state where a forwarded  phone  was  located.\nThen,  the  State Department would have to coordinate   with  the\nJapanese  Embassy.  An almost impossible task, if anyone had  the\nresources.  It took about 45 seconds for the call to be  complet-\ned.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION>>>>>>\n     PASSWORD:\n\nAlex  entered  his password, GESUNDHEIT and his  forced  response\nfrom his own PRG card.  His computer terminal paused.  If he  was\non satellite to Japan, or to Dallas or anywhere else, his  signal\ncould travel a hundred thousand miles or more each time he sent a\ncharacter from his keyboard.\n\n     CRYPT KEY:\n\nAlex Spiradon chose 43.  Each communication he had with  Homosoto\nwas also protected with full encryption.  If someone was able  to\nisolate  their conversations, all they would get would  be  sheer\ngarbage,  a  screen  full of unintelligible  symbols  and  random\ncharacters. By choosing 43, Alex told his computer and Homosoto's\ncomputer  to use Crypt Key 43, one of over 100 secret  keys  that\nboth computers held in their memory.  This cryptographic  scheme,\nusing the U.S.'s Data Encryption Standard, DES, and ANSI standard\nX9.17  was the same one that the Treasury Department and  Federal\nReserve  used to protect the transmission of over $1 trillion  of\nfunds transfers daily.\n\n     <<<<<<TRANSMISSION ENCODED>>>>>>\n\nThat was the signal for Alex to send the first words to Homosoto.\n\nGood Morning, Homosoto-San.\n\nAND TO YOU MY ESTEEMED PARTNER.  YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT.\n\nYes. All is in place.\n\nPLEASE CLARIFY . . .MY MEMORY IS NOT WHAT IT WAS.\n\nOf course.  The last of the Operators are in place.  We call  him\nSir  George.  That makes 8 altogether. San Francisco,  (SF),  New\nYork, (NY), Los Angeles, (LA), Boston, (BM), Atlanta, (AG) Chica-\ngo, (CI), Washington, (DC) and Dallas, (DT).\n\nAND THEY CAN BE TRUSTED?\n\nThey are aware of the penalty.  If not, we have others that  will\nreplace them. Besides, you are rewarding them most handsomely for\ntheir efforts.\nSO I AM.  I EXPECT RESULTS. AND THE OTHERS?\n\nThe Mail Men are waiting as well. Four of them in NY, DC, LA  and\nDT.\n\nYOU SAY MAIL MEN.  WHAT IS THAT TERM?\n\nThey  will  deliver  our messages in writing to  those  who  need\nadditional proof of our sincerity.  They know nothing other  than\nthey get paid, very well, to make sure that the addressees are in\nreceipt of their packages.\n\nVERY GOOD. AND THEY TOO ARE RESPONSIBLE?\n\nYes.   Elimination  is a strong motivation.  Besides,  they  know\nnothing.\n\nWHAT IF THEY READ THE CONTENTS?\n\nThat can only help.  They do not know where the money comes from.\nMost  need the money more than their lives.  My contacts make  my\nchoices ideal.  Death is . . .so permanent.\n\nI AGREE.  IT MAKES MEN HONORABLE, DOES IT NOT?\n\nMost  of the time, yes.  There are always exceptions, and we  are\nprepared for that, too.\n\nTHE SEKIGUN-HA ARE AT YOUR DISPOSAL.\n\nThank you.  The Ground Hogs, the first are in place.\n\nHOW MANY AND WHERE.\n\nOver  50 so far.  I will keep recruiting. We have 11 in the  long\ndistance phone companies and at AT&T, 3 at IBM, 14 in  government\npositions, 12 in major banks, a couple of insurance companies,  3\nHospitals  are  compromised . . .and a list of others.   We  will\nkeep the channels full, I promise.\n\nHOW WILL THEY FUNCTION?\n\nThey  will  gain access to the information we need, and  when  we\ncall,  they  will perform.  I will add more as  we  proceed.   It\namazes me, these Americans.  Anything for a buck.\n\nDO NOT DISAPPOINT ME.\n\nI  will not.  That is my promise.  When will the  information  be\nready?\n\nSOON. TOMORROW THE FIRST READER INFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO  YOU.\nCALLS  MAY BEGIN IN DAYS.  YOU  ORGANIZE IT. THE GROUND HOGS  ARE\nNOT TO BE ACTIVATED FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. THEY ARE TO PERFORM  THEIR\nJOBS AS  IF NOTHING IS WRONG.  DO THEY UNDERSTAND?\n\nGround  Hogs receive 2 paychecks. They understand  their  obliga-\ntions.   We pay 10 times their salary for their allegiance.   The\nOperators and Mail Men will start soon.\n\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS ALLEGIANCE. DON'T YOU KNOW THAT YET?\n\nAmericans  pay homage to the almighty dollar, and  nothing  else.\nThey will be loyal.\n\nAS YOU ARE MOTIVATED MY FRIEND, I DO NOT FORGET THAT.  BUT OTHERS\nCAN OFFER MORE DOLLARS AND WE CAN BE FOUND.  I CANNOT RISK  THAT,\nUNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.  DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISK?\n\nCompletely.  I am responsible for my people.\n\nAND THEY ARE PREPARED FOR THEIR JOBS?\n\nYes.   That is my responsibility, to insure the security  of  our\ntask.  No one must know.  I know my job.\n\nDO IT WELL.  I WILL LEAVE YOU.\n\n     <<<<< CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 5\n\n     Monday, September 14\n     New York City\n\nDoug!  Doug!\"  Scott hollered across the city room.  As  in  most\nnewspaper  offices,  the constant scurry of people  bumping  into\neach other while reading and walking gave the impression of  more\nactivity than there really was.  Desks were not in any particular\npattern, but it wasn't totally chaotic either.  Every desk had at\nleast one computer on it.  Some two  or three.  Scott pushed back\ninto  place  those that he dislodged while running  to  McGuire's\ndesk.\n\nDoug  McGuire noticed the early  hour, 8:39 A.M. on the one  wall\nclock  that gave Daylight Savings Time for the East  Coast.   The\nother dozen or so clocks spanned the time zones of the globe.  It\nwasn't like Scott to be his energetic youthful self before noon.\n\n\"Doug, I need you.\" Scott shouted from 3 desks away. \"It'll  just\ntake a minute.\"\n\nScott nearly dragged the balding, overweight, sometimes harsh  60\nyear old Doug McGuire across the newsroom.  They abruptly  halted\nin front of Scott's desk.  Boxes full of files everywhere; on the\nfloor,  piled 3 or 4 high, on his desk. \"Will you look  at  this.\nJust  look at this!\" He stuck a single sheet of paper  too  close\ninto Doug's face.  Doug pushed it away  to read it out loud.\n\nMcGuire read from the page. \"A Message from a Fan.  Thanks.\" Doug\nlooked perplexed.  He motioned at the paper hurricane on  Scott's\ndesk. \"So, what is this mess?  Where did it come from?\"\n\nScott  spoke  excitedly. \"I got another delivery, about  an  hour\nago.   I  think  it's from the same guy  who  sent  the  McMillan\nstuff.\"  He perused the boxes.\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" Doug asked curiously.\n\n\"Because  of what's in here.  I haven't been able to  go  through\nmuch of it, obviously, but I scanned through a few of the  boxes.\nThere's dirt on almost every company in the Fortune 1000.  Copies\nof  memoranda, false figures, confidential  position  statements,\nthe  truth  behind  a  lot of PR scandals, it  goes  on  and  on.\nThere's  even a copy of some of the shredded Ollie North  papers.\nOr so they say they are.  Who knows.  But, God!  There are  notes\nabout  behind the scene plays on mergers, who's screwing  who  to\nget  deals done . . .it's all here.  A hundred years  of  stories\nright here . . .\".\n\n\"Let's see what we've got here.\"  Doug was immediately hooked  by\nthe  treasure  trove of potential in from of  them  coupled  with\nScott's enthusiasm.  The best stories come from the least  likely\nplaces.   No reporter ever forgets the 3rd rate burglary  at  the\nWatergate that brought down a President.\n\nBy  late afternoon, Scott and several of the paper's  researchers\nhad  set  up a preliminary filing system.  They  categorized  the\nhundred of files and documents and computer printouts by company,\nalphabetically.  The contents were amazing.  Over 150 of the  top\nAmerican corporations were represented directly, and thousands of\nother by reference.  In every case, there was a revelation of one\nor  more particularly embarrassing or illegal  activities.   Some\nwere documented accounts and histories of past events and  others\nthat  were in progress. Many of the papers were  prognostications\nof future events of questionable ethics or legality.  It reminded\nScott of Jeanne Dixon style predictions.\n\nFrom  Wall  Street's ivory tower deals where payoffs  are  called\nconsulting fees, and in banking circles where delaying  transfers\nof  funds can yield millions of dollars in interest  daily,  from\nindustrial  secrets  stolen  or purchased from such  and  such  a\nsource, the laundry list was long.  Plans to effect such a  busi-\nness plan and how to disguise its true purposes from the ITC  and\nSEC.   Internal, very upper level policies which never reach  the\ncompany's  Employee Handbook; policies of  discrimination,  atti-\ntude,  and protective corporate culture which not  only transcend\nthe  law but in many cases, morality.  The false books, the  jim-\nmied numbers . . .they were in the boxes too, but that was almost\naccepted  accounting practice as long as you didn't  get  caught.\nBut  the depth of some of the figures was amazing.  Like how  one\ncomputer  company brought in Toshiba parts and sold them  to  the\ngovernment despite the ban on Toshiba components because of their\nsale of precision lathes to the Soviets.\n\n\"Jesus,\"  said Scott after a lengthy silence of  intent  reading.\n\"This  nails everyone, even the Government.\"\n\nThere  were well documented dossiers on how the EPA  made  unique\nexclusions hundred of times over based upon the financial  lobby-\ning  clout  of the particular offender.  Or how  certain  elected\nofficials in Washington had pocketed funds from their PAC  monies\nor  how defense contractors were advised in advance of  the  con-\ntents of an upcoming billion dollar RFP.\n\nThe  cartons of files were absolute political dynamite.  And,  if\nreleased, could have massive repercussions in the world financial\ncommunity.\n\nThere  was  a fundamental problem, though.  Scott  Mason  was  in\npossession of unsupported, but not unreasonable accusations, they\nwere certainly believable.  All he really had was leads, a  thou-\nsand leads in ten thousand different directions, with no apparent\ncoherency or theme, received from an anonymous and dubious donor.\nAnd there was no way of immediately gauging the veracity of their\ncontents.  He clearly remembered what is was like to be lawyered.\nThat held no appeal at the moment.\n\nThe  next  obvious question was, who would have  the  ability  to\ngather  this amount of information, most of which  was  obviously\nmeant to be kept very, very private.  Papers meant not for anyone\nbut only for a select group of insiders.\n\nLastly,  and just as important to the reporter; why?  What  would\nsomeone  gain  from  telling all the nasty goings  on  inside  of\nCorporate  America.   There have been so many  stories  over  the\nyears  about this company or that screwing over the  little  guy.\nHow the IRS and the government operated substantially outside  of\nlegal  channels.  The kinds of things that the Secretary  of  the\nTreasury  would prefer were kept under wraps.  Sometimes  stories\nof this type made the news, maybe a trial or two, but not exactly\nnoteworthy in the big picture.  White collar crime wasn't as good\nas the Simpsons or Roseanne, so it went largely  ignored.\n\nScott Mason needed to figure out what to do with his powder  keg.\nSo,  as any good investigative reporter would do, he  decided  to\npick  a few key pieces and see if the old axiom was true.   Where\nthere's smoke, there's fire.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFire.  That's exactly what Franklin Dobbs didn't want that Monday\nmorning.   He  and 50 other Corporate CEO's  across  the  country\nreceived  their  own unsolicited packages by courier.   Each  CEO\nreceived  a  dossier on his own company. A very  private  dossier\ncontaining  information that technically didn't, or wasn't  offi-\ncially supposed to exist.  Each one read their personalized  file\ncover to cover in absolute privacy.  And shock set in.\n\nOnly  a few of the CEO's in the New York area had ever  heard  of\nScott  Mason  before, and little did they know that  he  had  the\ncomplete collection of dossiers in his possession at the New York\nCity  Times.  Regardless, boardrooms shook to  their  very  core.\nWall  Street trading was untypically low for a Monday, less  than\n50,000,000  shares.  But CNN and other financial   observers  at-\ntributed the anomaly to random factors unconnected to the  secret\npanic that was spreading through Corporate America.\n\nBy  6 P.M., CEO's and key aides from 7 major  corporations  head-\nquartered  in the metropolitan New York area had agreed to  meet.\nThroughout  the  day,  CEO's routinely talk  to  other  corporate\nleaders  as  friends, acquaintances, for brain  picking  and  G2,\nmarket  probing  in the course of business.  Today,  though,  the\nscurry of inter-Ivory-Tower calls was beyond routine.\n\nThrough  a  complicated ritual dance  of  non-committal  consent,\nquestions  never asked and answers never given, with a good  dose\nof  Zieglerisms, a few  of the CEO's communicated  to each  other\nduring the day that they were not happy with the morning mail.  A\nfew agreed to talk together.  Unofficially of course, just for  a\ncouple  of  drinks with friends, and there's  nothing  wrong,  we\nadmit nothing, of course not.\n\nThese  are  the rules strictly obeyed for  a  non-encounter  that\nisn't  happening.   So they didn't meet in a very  private  room,\nupstairs  at the Executive Club, where sensitive  meetings  often\nnever  took  place.  One's presence in that room is  as  good  as\nbeing on in a black hole. You just weren't there, no matter what.\nPerfect.\n\nThe  room that wasn't there was heavily furnished and dark.   The\nmustiness  lent to the feeling of intrigue and incredulity the  7\nCEO's felt. Massive brown leather couches and matching  oversized\nchairs  surrounded by stout mahogany tables were dimly lit by the\nassortment of low wattage lamp fixtures.  There was a huge  round\ndining  table  large  enough for all of  Camelot,  surrounded  by\nmammoth  chairs  in  a large ante-room.    The  brocade  curtains\ncovered  long  windows that stretched from the  floor  to  ornate\ncorner moldings of the 16 foot ceilings.\n\nOne tired old black waiter with short cropped white hair appeared\nand  disappeared skillfully and invisibly.  He was so  accustomed\nto working with such distinguished gentlemen, and knew how impor-\ntant  their conversations were, that he took great pride  in  re-\nfilling  a drink without being noticed. With his little game,  he\nmade sure that drinks for everyone were always full.  They  spoke\nopenly around Lambert.  Lambert had worked the room since he  was\n16 during World War II and he saw no reason to trade occupations;\nhe  was  treated decently, and he doubled as a  bookie  for  some\nmembers which added to his income.  There was mutual trust.\n\n\"I don't know about you gentlemen,\" said Porter Henry, the  ener-\ngetic  and feisty leader of Morse Technologies,  defense  subcon-\ntractor.  \"I personally call this blackmail.\"  A few nods.\n\n\"I'm  not about to admit to anything, but have you  been  threat-\nened?\" demanded Ogden Roberts, Chairman of National First  Inter-\nstate.\n\n\"No,  I don't believe any of us have, in so many words.  And  no,\nnone  of  us have done anything wrong.  We are merely  trying  to\nkeep  sensitive corporate strategies private. That's all. But,  I\ndo  take  the position that we are being  intimidated.   I  think\nPorter's right. This is tantamount to blackmail. Or the precursor\nat a minimum.\"\n\nThey discussed, in the most circumlocutous manner, possibilities.\nThe why, how, and who's.  Who would know so much, about so  many,\nsupposedly sacrosanct secrets.  Therefore there must have been  a\nlot  of  whos,  mustn't there?  They figured about  50  of  their\nkindred CEO's had received similar packages, so that meant a  lot\nof whos were behind the current crisis in privacy.  Or maybe just\none big who.  OK, that's narrowed down real far; either a lot  of\nwhos, one big who, or somewhere in between.\n\nWhy?   They  all  agreed that demands would be  coming,  so  they\nlooked  for synergy between their firms, any sort of  connections\nthat spanned at first the seven of those present, to predict what\nkinds  of  demands.  But it is difficult to  find  hard  business\nconnections  between  an  insurance company, a  bank,  2  defense\ncontractors, a conglomerate of every drug store product known  to\nman and a fast food company.  The thread wasn't there.\n\nHow?   That was the hardest.  They certainly hadn't come up  with\nany  answers on the other two questions, so this was  asking  the\nimpossible.  CEO's are notorious for not knowing how their compa-\nnies  work  on  a day to day basis. Thus, after 4  or  5  drinks,\nspurious and arcane ideas were seriously considered.  UFO's  were\nresponsible,  I once saw one . . .my secretary,  I  never  really\ntrusted   her   at   all    .  .   .the   Feds!   Must   be   the\nIRS  .  .  .(my/his/your)  competitor  is  doing  it  to  all  of\nus . . .the Moonies, maybe the Moonies . . .\n\n\"Why don't we just go to the Feds?\" asked Franklin Dobbs who  did\nnot participate in the conjecturing stream of consciousness  free\nfor all.  Silence cut through the room instantly.  Lambert looked\nup from his corner to make  sure they were all still alive.\n\n\"I'm  serious.  The FBI is perfect.  We all  operate  interstate,\nand internationally.  Would you prefer the NYPD?\"  he said  dero-\ngatorally waiting any voices of dissent.\n\n\"C'mon  Frank.  What are we going to tell them?\"   Ogden  Roberts\nthe banker asked belligerently.  The liquor was having an effect.\n\"Certainly  not the truth . . .\" he cut himself short,  realizing\nthat  he  came dangerously close to  admitting  some  indefinable\nwrong  he  had  committed.  \"You know what I  mean,\"  he  quickly\nadded.\n\n\"We  don't go into all of the detail. An abbreviated form of  the\ntruth,   all  true, but maybe not everything.  I am sure  we  all\nagree  that  we  want to keep this, ah, situation,  as  quiet  as\npossible.\"  Rapid assent came from all around.\n\n\"All we need to say is that we have been contacted,  in a threat-\nening  manner.  That no demands have been made  yet, but  we  are\nwilling  to cooperate with the authorities.  That would give   us\nall a little time, to re-organize our priorities, if you see what\nI mean?\"  Dobbs added. The seven CEO's were thoughtful.\n\n\"Now  this  doesn't  mean that we all have  to  agree  on  this,\"\nFranklin  Dobbs said.  \"But as for me, I have gone over this,  in\nlimited  detail,  with  my attorney, and he agrees with it  on  a\nstrategic level.  If someone's after you,  and you can't see 'em,\nget  the  guys with the White Hats on your side.   Then  do  some\nhousekeeping.  I am going to the FBI.  Anybody care to join me?\"\n\nIt was going to be a lonesome trip.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     September, 4 Years Ago\n     Tokyo, Japan.\n\nOSO Industries maintained its world headquarters in the OSO World\nBank Building which towered 71 stories over downtown Tokyo.  From\nthe executive offices on the 66th floor, on a clear day, the view\nreached  as far as the Pacific. It was from these  lofty  reaches\nthat Taki Homosoto commanded his $30 Billion empire which  spread\nacross 5 continents, 112 countries, and employed almost a quarter\nmillion people.\n\nOSO  Industries had diversified since it humble beginnings  as  a\nused tire junkstore.\n\nThe Korean conflict had been a windfall.   Taki Homosoto  started\na  tire  retreading business in 1946, during  the  occupation  of\nJapan.  The Americans were so smart, he thought.  Bring over  all\nof  your men, tanks, jeeps and doctors not telling us  the  truth\nabout radiation, and you forget spare tires.  Good move, Yankee.\n\nTaki  gouged the Military on pricing so badly, and the  Americans\ndidn't  seem  care, that the Pentagon didn't  think  twice  about\npaying  $700 for toilet seats decades later. Taki did give  great\nservice  -  after all his profits were so  staggeringly  high  he\ncould afford it.  Keep the American's happy, feed their ego,  and\nthey'll come back for more. No sense of pride.  Suckers.\n\nWhen  the Americans moved in for Korea, Tokyo was both a  command\npost  for the war effort and the first choice of R&R by  service-\nmen.  OSO Industries was in a perfect position to take  advantage\nof  the US Government's tire needs throughout the conflict.   OSO\nwas  already  in place, doing a good job; Taki  had  bought  some\nfriends  in the US military, and a few arrangements were made  to\nkeep business coming his way.\n\nTaki accumulated millions quickly.  Now he needed to diversify.\n\nRealizing  that the war would come to an end some  day,  Homosoto\nbegin making plans. OSO Radio sets appeared on the market  before\nthe end of the Korean Police Action.  Then, with the  application\nof  the  transistor,  the portable radio  market  exploded.   OSO\nIndustries  made more transistor radios than all  other  Japanese\nelectronics  firms combined.  Then came black and  white  televi-\nsions.  The  invention  of the single beam color  TV  tube  again\nbrought OSO billions in revenues every year.\n\nNow,  OSO was the model of a true global corporation.  OSO  owned\nbanks and investment companies. Their semiconductor and electron-\nics products were household words. They controlled a vast network\nof companies; electronic game manufacturers, microwave and appli-\nance  manufacturers,  and notably, acres and acres  of  Manhattan\nIsland, California and Hawaii.  They owned and operated  communi-\ncations companies, including their own geosynchronous  satellite.\nOSO  positioned  itself  as a holding company  with  hundreds  of\nsubsidiaries,  each  with their own  specialty,  operating  under\nthousands of names.  Taki Homosoto wove an incredibly complex web\nof corporate influence and intrigue.\n\nOSO was one of the 10 largest corporations in the world.   Reaga-\nnomics  had already assisted in making OSO and  Homosoto  himself\npolitically  important  to both Japan and the  US.   Exactly  how\nHomosoto  wanted  it.  American leaders,  Senators,  Congressmen,\nappointees,  lobbyists, in fact much of Washington coddled up  to\nHomosoto.   His empire planned years in advance.  The US  Govern-\nment,  unofficially  craved his insights, and  in  characteristic\nWashington style, wanted to be near someone important.   Homosoto\nrelished  it.   Ate  it up.  He was a  most  cordial,  unassuming\nhumble guest.  He played the game magnificently.\n\nAlmost  the entire 66th floor of the OSO Bank Building was  dedi-\ncated to Homosoto and his immediate staff.  Only a handful of the\nmore then 200,000 people that OSO Industries employed had  access\nto the pinnacle of the OSO tower which graced the Tokyo skyline.\n\nThe building was designed by Pei, and received international  ac-\nclaim  as  an architectural statement. The atrium  in  the  lobby\nvaulted  almost  700  feet skyward  precursoring  American  hotel\ndesign in the next decade.  Plants, trees over 100 feet tall  and\nwaterfalls graced the atria and the overhanging skylobbies.   The\nfirst floor lobby was designed around a miniature replica of  the\nGing  Sha forest, fashioned with thousands of Bonzai trees.   The\nmini  forest was built to be viewed from various  heights  within\nthe atrium to simulate a flight above the earth at distances from\n2 to 150 miles.\n\nThe lobby of OSO Industries was a veritable museum.  The Van Gogh\ncollection was not only the largest private or public  assemblage\nin  the  world, but also represented over $100 Million  spent  in\nSothby and Christies auctions worldwide since 1975.\n\nTo  get to the elevator to the 66th floor, a security  check  was\nperformed,  including a complete but unobtrusive electronic  scan\nof the entire person and his belongings.  To all appearances, the\nprocedure  was  no  more than airport security.  However  to  the\ninitiate  or the suspect, it was evident from the  accuracy  with\nwhich  the guards targeted specific contraband on a person or  in\nhis  belongings that they knew more than they were telling.   The\nOSO guards had the girth of Sumo wrestlers, and considering their\nsheer  mass,  they received little hassle.  Very  few  deemed  it\nprudent to cross them.\n\nThe lobby for all of its grandeur, ceilings of nearly 700   feet,\nwas  a fairly austere experience.  But, the elevator to the  66th\nfloor  altered  that  image at once.  It was  this  glass  walled\nelevator, the size of a small office, with appropriately comfort-\nable  furnishings, that Miles Foster rode.  From the  comfort  of\nthe living room setting in the elevator, he enjoyed a panorama of\nthe  atrium  as  it disappeared beneath him.  He  looked  at  the\nforest and imagined what astronauts saw when they catapulted into\norbit.   The executive elevator was much slower than the  others.\nEither  the residents in the penthouse relished the solitude  and\nview  or  they  had motion sickness.  Nonetheless,  it  was  most\nimpressive.\n\n\"Ah,  Mister Foster! Welcome to OSO.  Please to step  this  way.\"\nMiles  Foster  was  expected at the terminus of  the  lift  which\nopened  into  an obscenely large waiting room  that  contained  a\nvariety  of  severe and obviously uncomfortable  furniture.  Aha!\nMiles,  thought.  That's exactly what this is.  Another art  gal-\nlery,  albeit a private one for the eyes of his host and  no  one\nelse. White walls, white ceilings, polished parquet floors, track\nlighting,  recessed lights, indirect lights.  Miles noticed  that\nthe room as pure as the driven snow didn't have any windows.   He\ndidn't  recognize  much of the art, but given his host,  it  must\nhave represented a sizable investment.\n\nMiles  was ushered across the vast floor to  a set of  handsomely\ncarved,  too tall wooden doors with almost garish gold  hardware.\nHis slight Japanese host barely tapped on the door, almost  inau-\ndibly. He paused and stood at attention as he blurted an obedient\n\"Hai!\"\n\nThe  aide opened both doors from the middle, and in deference  to\nMr.  Foster,  moved to one side to let the  visitor  be  suitably\nimpressed.    Homosoto's office was a total contrast to his  gal-\nlery.   Miles first reaction was astonishment.  It  was  slightly\ndizzying.  The ceiling slanted to a height of over 25 feet at the\nouter walls, which were floor to ceiling glass. The immense  room\nprovided  not only a spectacular view of Tokyo and 50  miles  be-\nyond, but lent one the feeling of being outside.\n\nComing  from the U.S. Government, such private opulence  was  not\ncommon. It was to be expected in his family's places of business,\nthe  gaming parlors of Las Vegas, but not in normal commerce.  He\nhad been to Trump Tower in New York, but that was a public build-\ning, a place for tourists.  This office, he used the word  liber-\nally, was palatial.\n\nIt  was  decorated  in spartan fashion with  cherry  wood  walls.\nArtwork, statues, figurines, all Japanese in style, sat  wherever\nthere was an open surface.  A few gilt shelves and marble display\ntables  were randomly scattered around the room.  Not  chaoticly;\njust  the  opposite.   The scattering  was  exquisitely  planned.\nThere was a dining alcove, privatized by lavish rice paper panels\nfor  eating  in  <MI>suhutahksi<D>. Eating on the  floor  was  an\nhonored ritual.  There was a small pit under the table for  curl-\ning one's legs on the floor.\n\nA   conference  table with 12 elegant wooden chairs  sat  at  the\nopposite end of the cavernous office. In the center of the  room,\nat  the  corner  of the building, was Homosoto's  desk,  or  work\nsurface if you prefer.  It was large enough for four, yet Homoso-\nto,  as he stood to greet Foster, appeared to dwarf his  environ-\nment  and desk.  Not in size, but in confidence.   His  personage\nwas in total command. The desk and its equipment were on a  plat-\nform some 6\" above the rest of the room. The intended effect  was\nnot lost on Foster.\n\nThe sides of the glossy cherrywood desk were slightly elevated to\nmake  room for a range of video monitors, communications  facili-\nties,  and  computers which accessed Homosoto's empire.   A  vast\ntelephone  console  provided  tele-conferencing  to  OSO  offices\nworldwide.  Dow Jones, CNN, Nippon TV were constantly  displayed,\nvisible only to Homosoto.  This was Homosoto's Command Central as\nhe liked to call it.\n\nFoster  gawked  at the magnificent surroundings as  he  stood  in\nfront  of his assigned seat. A comfortable, plush, black  leather\nchair.  It was one of several arranged in a  sunken  conversation\npit.\n\nHomosoto acknowledged Foster's presence with the briefest of nods\nas  he  stepped down off of his aerie.  Homosoto  wore  expensive\nclothes.  A dark brown suit, matching solid tie and the omnipres-\nent  solid white starched shirt.  It didn't fit, like most  Japa-\nnese business uniforms.\n\nHe  was short, no more than five foot six, Miles  noticed,  after\nHomosoto got down to the same level as the rest of the room.   On\nthe heavy side, he walked slowly and deliberately.  Eyes  forward\nafter  the  obligatory nod. His large head was  sparsely  covered\nwith  little wisps of hair in nature's futile attempt  to  clothe\nthe  top of his freckled skull.  Even at 59 Homosoto's  hair  was\nstill  pitch  black.  Miles wasn't sure if  Grecian  Formula  was\navailable  in Japan.  The short crop accentuated  the  pronounced\nears.\n\nA rounded face was peppered with spots, dark freckles perhaps, or\nmaybe  carcinoma.   His deep set black eyes  stared  through  the\nobject  of  his attention.  Homosoto was not the  friendly  type,\nthought Miles.\n\nHomosoto stood in front of Miles, extended his hand and bowed the\nmost  perfunctory  of  bows.  Miles took his  hand,  expecting  a\nstrong  grip.  Instead he was greeted with a wet  fish  handshake\nwhich wriggled quickly from his grasp.  Homosoto didn't give  the\nslightest indication of a smile.  The crow's feet around his eyes\nwere  caused  by pudginess, not happiness. When he  sat  opposite\nFoster in a matching chair, he began without any pleasantries.\n\n\"I hear you are the best.\"  Homosoto stared at Foster.  It was  a\nstatement that required a response.\n\nFoster  shifted his weight a little in the chair.  What a way  to\nstart.   This guy must think he's hot shit.  Well, maybe  he  is.\nFirst  class, all expense paid trip to Tokyo,  plus  consultation\nfees.  In  advance.  Just for one conversation, he was  told,  we\njust  want some advice.  Then, last night, and the night  before,\nhe  was honored with sampling the finest Oriental women. His  hot\nbutton.   All expenses paid, of course.  Miles knew he was  being\nbuttered up, for what he didn't know, but he took advantage of it\nall.\n\n\"That's what's your people tell you.\"\n\nFoster took the challenge and glared, albeit with a smirk dimpled\nsmile, politely, right back at Homosoto.  Homosoto continued  his\nstare.  He didn't relax his intensity.\n\n\"Mr.  Foster,\"  Homosoto continued, his face  still  emotionless.\n\"Are you as good as they say?\"  he demanded.\n\nMiles Foster defiantly spat out the one word response. \"Better.\"\n\nHomosoto's  eyes squinted.  \"Mr. Foster, if that is true, we  can\ndo  business.  But first, I must be convinced.  I can assure  you\nwe know quite a bit about you already, otherwise you wouldn't  be\nhere.\"   Miles  noticed that Homosoto  spoke  excellent  English,\nclipped  in style, but Americanized.  He  occasionally  stretched\nhis vowels, to the brink of a drawl.\n\n\"Yeah,  so  what do you know.  Pulled up a few  data  bases?  Big\nDeal.\" Miles cocked his head at Homosoto's desk.  \"I would assume\nthat  with  that  equipment, you can probably  get  whatever  you\nwant.\"\n\nHomosoto let a shimmer of a smile appear at the corners  off  his\nmouth.   \"You are most perceptive, Mr. Foster.\"  Homosoto  paused\nand leaned back in the well stuffed chair.  \"Mr. Foster, tell  me\nabout your family.\"\n\nMiles  neck reddened. \"Listen! You called me, I didn't call  you.\nAll I ever knew about OSO was that you made ghetto blasters, TV's\nand  vibrators.  So therefore, you wanted me, not my family.   If\nyou  had  wanted  them you would have called  them.\"  Miles  said\nloudly.  \"So, keep my family the fuck out of it.\"\n\n\"I do not mean to offend,\" Homosoto said offensively. \"I just  am\nmost  curious  why you didn't go to work for your  family.   They\nhave money, power.  You would have been a very important man, and\na  very  rich  one.\" Homosoto said matter of  factly.   \"So,  the\nprudent man must wonder why you went to work for your Government?\nAren't  your  family  and your government, how shall  I  say,  on\nopposite sides?\"\n\n\"My  family's got nothing to do with this or you. Clear?\"   Miles\nwas  adamant.  \"But,  out of courtesy for getting  me  laid  last\nnight,  I might as well tell you.  I went to the feds cause  they\nhave  the  best  computers, the biggest equipment  and  the  most\ninteresting  work.   Not much money, but I have a backup  when  I\nneed it.  If I went to work for my family, as you put it, I would\nhave been a glorified beancounter. And that's not what I do.   It\nwould  have  been no challenge. Boring, boring,  boring!\"   Miles\nsmiled sarcastically at Homosoto. \"Happy now?\"\n\nHomosoto didn't flinch. \"Does that mean you do not disapprove  of\nyour family's activities?  How they make money?\"\n\n\"I don't give a fuck!\" Miles yelled.  \"How does that grab you?  I\ndon't give a flying fuck.  They were real good to me, paid a  lot\nof  my way.  I love my mother and she's not a hit man.  My  uncle\ndoes I don't know what or care.  They're family, that's it.   How\nmuch clearer do you want it?\" Miles continued shouting.\n\nHomosoto grinned and held up his hands. \"My apologies Mr. Foster.\nI mean no disrespect.  I just like to know who works for me.\"\n\n\"Hey, I don't work for you yet.\"\n\n\"Of course, a simple slip of the tongue.\"\n\n\"Right.\"  Miles snapped sarcastically.\n\nHomosoto ignored this last comment.  The insincere smile left his\nface,  replaced  with a more serious countenance.  \"Why  did  you\nleave your post with the National Security Agency, Mr. Foster?\"\n\nAnother inquisition, thought Miles.  What a crock.  Make it  good\nfor the gook.\n\n\"'Cause I was working for a bunch of bungling idiots who  insured\ntheir  longevity  by creating an invincible  bureaucracy.\"  Miles\ndecided  that a calm beginning might be more appropriate.   \"They\nhad  no real idea of what was going on.  Their heads were so  far\nup  their ass they had a tan line across their chests.   Whenever\nwe  had  a good idea, it was either too novel, too  expensive  or\nneeded additional study. Or, it was relegated to a committee that\nmight  react  in 2 years.  What a pile of bullshit,  a  waste  of\ntime.   We could have achieved a lot more without all the  inter-\nference.\"\n\n\"Mr.  Foster, you say, 'we'.  Who is 'we'?\"   Homosoto  pointedly\nasked Miles.\n\n\"The  analysts,  the people who did the real  work.   There  were\nhundreds of us on the front lines. The guys who sweated  weekends\nand  nights  to make our country safe from  the  Communists.  The\nmanagers just never got with the program.\"\n\n\"Mr. Foster, how many of the other analysts, in your opinion, are\ngood?\"\n\nMiles stepped back in his mind to think about this.  \"Oh, I guess\nI  knew  a half dozen guys, and one girl, who were  pretty  good.\nShe  was  probably the best, other than me,\"  he  bragged.  \"Some\nchicken.\"\n\n\"Excuse me? Chicken?\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry.\" Miles looked up in thought. \"Ah, chicks, fox,  look-\ner, sweet meat, gash, you know?\"\n\n\"Do you mean she's very pretty?\"\n\nMiles  suppressed an audible chuckle. \"Yeah, that's  right.  Real\npretty,  but  real smart, too.  Odd combination,  isn't  it?\"  he\nsmiled a wicked smile.\n\nHomosoto  ignored  the crudeness.  \"What are your  politics,  Mr.\nFoster?\"\n\n\"Huh?   My politics?  What the hell has that got to do with  any-\nthing?\"  Miles demanded.\n\n\"Just answer the question, please, Mr. Foster?\"  Homosoto quietly\nordered.\n\nMiles was getting incensed.  \"Republican, Democrat?  What do  you\nmean?  I vote who the fuck I want to vote for.  Other than  that,\nI don't play.\"\n\n\"Don't  play?\"   Homosoto briefly pondered the  idiom.  \"Ah,  so.\nDon't play.  Don't get involved.  Is that so?\"\n\n\"Right.   They're all fucked.  I vote for the stupidest  assholes\nrunning  for  office.  Any office.  With any luck he'll  win  and\nreally screw things up.\"  Homosoto hit one of Miles hot  buttons.\nPolitics.  He listened attentively to Miles as he carried on.\n\n\"That's  about  the only way to fix anything. First fuck  it  up.\nReal bad.  Create a crisis.  Since the Government ignores whoever\nor whatever isn't squeaking that's the only way to get any atten-\ntion.  Make noise.  Once you create a crisis, Jeez, just look  at\nGranada  and Panama and Iraq to justify Star Wars, you get a  lot\nof  people  on  for the ride. Just look at  the  national  energy\ndebate.  Great  idea,  30  years and  $5  trillion  late.   Then,\n'ooooh!',  they say.  'We got a big problem.  We better fix  it.'\nThen they all want to be heroes and every podunk politico  shoots\noff his mouth about the latest threat to humanity. \"\n\n\"That's your politics?\"\n\n\"Sure.   If you want to get something fixed, first fuck it up  so\nbad  that everyone notices and then they'll be crawling  up  your\nass trying to help you fix it.\"\n\n\"Very novel, Mr. Foster.  Very novel and very cynical.\"  Homosoto\nlooked mildly amused.\n\n\"Not meant to be.  Just true.\"\n\n\"It  seems  to me that you hold no particular  allegiance.  Would\nthat  be a fair observation?\"  Homosoto pressed the same line  of\nquestioning.\n\n\"To  me.  That's my allegiance.  And not much of anything  else.\"\nMiles sounded defensive.\n\n\"Then,  Mr. Foster, what does it take to make you a job offer.  I\nam  sure  money  isn't everything to a man  like  you.\"  Homosoto\nleaned  back. All 10 of his fingers met in mirror  image  fashion\nand performed push ups on each other.\n\nFoster  returned  Homosoto's dare with a  devastating  stare-down\nthat  looked  beyond  Homosoto's face. It looked right  into  his\nmind.   Foster used the knuckles from both hands for supports  as\nhe leaned on the table between them.  He began speaking  deliber-\nately and coherently.\n\n\"My greatest pleasure?  A challenge. A great challenge. Yes,  the\nmoney  is nice, don't get me wrong,  but the thrill is the  chal-\nlenge.  I spent years with people ignoring my advice, refusing to\nlisten  to  me.   And I was right so many times  when  they  were\nwrong.   Then they would start blaming everyone else and  another\ncommittee  is set up to find out what went wrong. Ecch!  I  would\nlove to teach them a lesson.\"\n\n\"How  unfortunate  for them that they failed  to  recognize  your\nabilities  and  let  your skills serve them.   Yes,  indeed,  how\nunfortunate.\"  Homosoto said somberly.\n\n\"So,\"  Miles  said arrogantly as he retreated back to  his  seat,\n\"you  seem to be asking a lot of questions, and getting a lot  of\nanswers.   It  is your dime, so I owe you  something.   But,  Mr.\nHomosoto, I would like to know what you're looking for.\"\n\nHomosoto  stood up erect. \"You, Mr. Foster. You. You are  what  I\nhave  been  looking  for.  And, if you do your job  right,  I  am\nmaking the assumption you will accept, you will become  wealthier\nthan you ever hoped.  Ever dreamed.  Mr. Foster, your  reputation\nprecedes  you.\" He sincerely extended his hand to Foster.  \"I  do\nbelieve  we can do business.\" Homosoto was beaming at Miles  Fos-\nter.\n\n\"OK,  ok, so if I accept, what do I do?\" said Miles as  he  again\nshook Homosoto's weak hand.\n\n\"You,  Mr.  Foster, are going to lead an invasion of  the  United\nStates of America.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                    Chapter 6\n\n     3 Years Ago\n     Sunnyvale, California.\n\nPierre Troubleaux was staggered beyond reason.  His life was just\nthreatened and he didn't know what to do about it.  What the hell\nwas  this disk anyway?  Military secrets?  Industrial  espionage?\nThen  why  put it on the dGraph disks and programs?  Did  I  just\nagree?   What did I say?  I don't remember what I said.  Maybe  I\nsaid maybe.\n\nPanic  yielded  to confusion.  What is so wrong?  This  was  just\nsome old Japanese guy who was making some veiled Oriental threat.\nNo,  it  was  another one of those  cultural  differences.   Like\ncalisthenics  before work at those Japanese companies that  satu-\nrate the West Coast.  Sure it sounded like a threat, but this  is\nOSO Industries we are talking about.  That would be like the head\nof  Sony using extortion to sell Walkmen.  Impossible.   All  the\nsame,  it was scary and he had no idea what was on the disk.   He\ncalled Max.\n\n\"Max!   What are you doing?\"  What he meant, and Max  understood,\nwas 'I need you.  Get your ass up here now.'\n\n\"On my way Amigo.\"\n\nThe  next few minutes waiting for Max proved to be  mentally  ex-\nhausting.  He thought of hundreds of balancing arguments for both\nsides of the coin.  Be concerned, this guy is nuts and meant  it,\nor I misunderstood something, or it got lost in the  translation.\nHe prayed for the latter.\n\n\"Yo, what gives?\"  Max walked into Pierre's office without knock-\ning.\n\n\"Tell  me  what's on this!\" Pierre thrust  the disk up  at  Max's\nlarge physique.\n\nMax  held  the disk to his forehead and gazed skyward.   \"A  good\nstart.  Yes, a good start.\" Max grinned.\n\nPierre  groaned, knowing full well  that the Kreskin routine  had\nto  be  completed  before anything serious  was  discussed.   Max\nbrought  the disk to his mouth and blew on it so the disk  holder\nbulged  in the middle.  Max pulled out the disk and pretended  to\nread  it.  \"What do you call 1000 lawyers at the  bottom  of  the\nocean.\"  Pierre chuckled a half a chuck.  He wasn't in the  mood,\nbut then he had no love for lawyers.\n\n\"Max!  Please.\"\n\n\"Hey, just trying new material....\"\n\n\" . . .that's 5  years old.\" Pierre interrupted.\n\n\"All  right already. Gimme a break. OK, let's have a look.\"  They\nwent   behind Pierre's desk and inserted the disk in his IBM  AT.\nMax asked the computer for a listing of the diskette's  contents.\nThe screen scrolled and stopped.\n\nC:\\a:\nA:\\dir\n\n     FILE84.EXE   01/01/80    704\n     FILE85.EXE       01/01/80    2013\n     FILE86.EXE       01/01/80    1900\n     FILE87.EXE       01/01/80    567\n     FILE88.EXE   01/01/80    2981\n     FILE89.EXE       01/01/80    4324\n     FILE90.EXE       01/01/80    1280\n     FILE91.EXE   01/01/80    1395\n     FILE92.EXE   01/01/80    2374\n     FILE93.EXE       01/01/80    3912\n\n     93 Files     1457 Bytes Remaining\nA:\\\n\n\"Just a bunch of small programs.  What are they?\"  Max's lack  of\nconcern was understandable, but it annoyed Pierre all the same.\n\n\"I  don't know, that's what I'm asking you. What are they?   What\nkind of programs?\"\n\n\"Jeez, Pierre, I don't know.  Games maybe? Small utilities?  Have\nyou used them yet?\"\n\n\"No, not yet, someone just gave them to me.  That's all.\"   Pier-\nre's nervousness betrayed him.\n\n\"Well  let's  try one, see what it does.\"  Max typed  in  FILE93.\nThat would run the program.\n\nA few seconds later the disk stopped and the computer returned to\nits  natural  state, that of  the C:\\.  \"That  one  didn't  work.\nLet's  try 92.  H'mmmm.   That's curious, it doesn't do  anything\neither.   Looks like a bunch of crap to me.  What are  they  sup-\nposed to do?\"  Max shrugged his shoulders.\n\nMax  kept trying a few more of the numbered programs.   \"I  don't\nknow, really.  Maybe it's just a joke.\"\n\n\"Some  joke,  I  don't get it.  Where's the  punch  line?   Damn,\nnothing.\" Max punched a few more keys. \"Let me have this. I wanna\ntake me a look a closer look,\" Max said as he pulled the diskette\nfrom the machine.\n\n\"Where are you going with that?\"\n\n\"To  my lab.  I'll disassemble it and see what's what.   Probably\nsome garbage shareware.  I'll call you later.\"\n\nAt 4PM Max came flying through Pierre's office door again. Pierre\nwas doing his magic . . .talking to the press on the phone.\n\n\"Where did you get this?\" bellowed Max as he strutted across  the\nplush carpet holding the diskette in his hand.\n\nPierre waved him silent and onto the couch. He put up one  finger\nto  indicate just a minute.  Pierre cut the reporter short on  an\nobviously  contrived weak excuse. He promised to call  back  real\nsoon.  He meant that part.  He would call back.\n\n\"Pierre, where did you get this?\" Max asked again.\n\n\"Nowhere. What's on it?\" he demanded.\n\n\"Viruses.  Lots of 'em.\"\n\n\"You mean it's sick?  Like contagious?\" Pierre was being genuine.\n\n\"No you Frog idiot. Computer viruses.\"\n\n\"What is a computer virus? A machine can't get sick.\"\n\n\"How  wrong you are ol' buddy.  You're in for a lesson now.   Sit\ndown.\" Pierre obliged.  This was Max's turf.\n\n\"Here  goes. If I lose you, just holler, ok, Amigo?\"  Pierre  had\ngrown  to hate being called Amigo, but he had never asked Max  to\nstop.  Besides, now wasn't the appropriate time to enlighten  Max\nas  to  the  ins and outs of nick name  niceties.  Pierre  nodded\nsilent agreement.\n\n\"Computers  basically use two type of information.  One  type  of\ninformation  is called data.  That's numbers, words, names  on  a\nlist, a letter, accounting records whatever.  The second type are\ncalled  programs, we tweaks call them  executables.   Executables\nare almost alive.  The instructions contained in the  executables\noperate  on  the  data.  Everything else  is  a  variation  on  a\ntheme.\"\n\n\"Yeah, so the computer needs a program to make it work.  Everyone\nknows that.  What about these?\"\n\n\"I'm getting there. Hold on.  There are several types of executa-\nbles, some are COM files, SYS and BAT files act like  executables\nand  so do some OVR and OVL files.  In IBM type computers  that's\nabout  it.  Apples and MACs and others have  similar  situations,\nbut  these  programs are for IBM's.  Now imagine  a  program,  an\nexecutable  which  is  designed  to  copy  itself  onto   another\nprogram.\"\n\n\"Yeah,  so.  That's how dGraph works.  We essentially  seam  our-\nselves into the application.\"\n\n\"Exactly,  but dGraph is benign.  These,\"  he holds up the  disk-\nette,  \"these are contaminated. They are viruses.  I only  looked\nat a couple of them, disassembly  takes a while.  Pierre, if only\none  of these programs were on your computer, 3 years  from  now,\nthe  entire  contents  of your hard disk would  be  destroyed  in\nseconds!\"    Pierre  was stunned.  It had never occurred  to  him\nthat a program could be harmful.\n\n\"That's  3 years from now?  So what?  I probably won't  have  the\nsame  programs on my computer then anyway.  There's always  some-\nthing new.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter.  The viruses I looked at here copy themselves\nonto other programs and hide themselves.  They do nothing,  noth-\ning at all except copy themselves onto other programs.  In a  few\ndays  every program on your computer, I mean every one  would  be\ninfected,  would be sick.  Every one would have the same  flu  if\nyou  wish.   And then, 3  years from now, any computer  that  was\ninfected  would destroy itself.  And, the virus itself  would  be\ndestroyed  as well.  Kind  of like Jap kamikazes from  World  War\nII.  They know exactly when they will  die and hope to take a lot\nof others with them. In this case the virus commits suicide in  3\nyears. Any data or program within spitting distance, so to speak,\ngoes too.\"\n\n\"So  why doesn't someone go looking for viruses and come up  with\nantidotes?\"\n\n\"It's  not that simple.  A well written virus will  disguise  it-\nself.   The ones you gave me, at least  the ones  I  disassembled\nnot only hide themselves, but they are dormant until  activation;\nin this case on a specific date.\"  Max continued the never ending\neducation of Pierre.  \"Besides, it's been proven that there is no\nway  to  have a universal piece of software  to  detect  viruses.\nCan't be done.\"\n\n\"Whew  . . .who comes up with this stuff?\"  Pierre was trying  to\ngrasp the importance of what he was hearing.\n\n\"Used  to be a UNIX type of practical joking; try writing a  pro-\ngram that would annoy fellow programmers.  Pretty harmless  fool-\ning around.  No real damage, just embarrassment that called for a\nsimilar revenge.  It was a game of one upmanship within universi-\nty  computer science labs. I saw a little of  it while  I  worked\nat  the school computer labs, but again it was harmless  shenani-\ngans.   These though.  Wow.  Deadly.  Where the hell did you  get\nthem?\"\n\nPierre was in a quandary. Tell or don't tell.  Do I or don't   I?\nHe trusted Max implicitly, but what about the threat.  Naw, I can\ntell Max.  Anything.\n\n\"Homosoto.\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Max incredulously.\n\n\"Homosoto.  He gave it to me.\"  Pierre was solemn.\n\n\"Why? What for?\"\n\n\"He said that I was to put it on the dGraph disks that we sell.\"\n\n\"He's  crazy.   That's absolutely nuts.  Do you know  what  would\nhappen?\"  Max  paced   the floor as he spoke  angrily.  \"We  sell\nthousands of dGraph's every month.  Tens of thousands.  And  half\nof the computer companies ship dGraph with their machines.  In  3\nyears time we may have over  a couple of million copies of dGraph\nin  the  field.  And who knows how many  millions  more  programs\nwould   be   infected,  too.   Tens  of  millions   of   infected\nprograms  .  . .my God! Do you know how many  machines  would  be\ndestroyed  . . . well maybe not all destroyed but it's about  the\nsame  thing.  The effects would be devastating.\"  Max stopped  to\nabsorb what he was saying.\n\n\"How  bad could it be?  Once they're discovered, can't  your  vi-\nruses  be destroyed?\" Pierre was curious about the newly  discov-\nered power.\n\n\"Well,  yes and no.  A virus that is dormant for that long  years\nis also called a Time Bomb and a Trojan Horse.  There would be no\nreason  to  suspect that a legitimate software company  would  be\nshipping a product that would damage computers.  The thought   is\nabsurd . . .it's madness.  But brilliant madness.  Even if a  few\nof  the  viruses accidentally go off prematurely, the  virus  de-\nstroys  itself   in the process. Poof! No smoking gun.   No  evi-\ndence.  Nobody would have clue until V-Day.\"\n\n\"V-Day?\"\n\n\"Virus Day.\"\n\n\"Max, what's in this for Homosoto? What's the angle?\"\n\n\"Shit,  I can't think of one.  If  it ever got out that our  pro-\ngrams  were infected it would be the end of DGI.  All  over.   On\nthe other hand, if no one finds out before V-Day, all the PC's in\nthe  country,  or Jesus, even the world, self destruct  at  once.\nIt's  then only a matter of time before DGI is caught in the act.\nAnd  then,  Amigo, it's really over.  For you, me and  DGI.  What\nexactly did Homosoto say?\"\n\nPierre  was teetering between  terror  and disbelief. How had  he\ngotten into this position?  His mind wandered back over the  last\nfew years since he  and Max had come up with the Engine. Life has\nbeen  real good.  Sure, I don't get much music in anymore, and  I\nhave  kinda  been seduced by the fast lane, but so what?   So,  I\ntake  a  little more credit than credit's due,  but  Max  doesn't\nmind. He really doesn't.\n\nThe  threat. Was it real?   Maybe.  He tried to convince  himself\nthat his mind was playing tricks on itself.  But the intellectual\nexercises  he performed at lightening speed,  cranial  neuro-syn-\napses  switching for all they were worth, did not  permit  Pierre\nthe luxury of a respite of calm.\n\n\"He  said he wanted me to put this on dGraph programs.   Sometime\nin the future.  That's about it.\"   There was no reason to  speak\nof the threats.  No, no reason at all.  His vision became sudden-\nly clear.  He was being boxed into a corner.\n\n\"Well  . . .?\" Max's eyes widened as he expected a response  from\nPierre.\n\n\"Well what?\"\n\n\"Well,  what are you going to tell him? Or, more like  where  are\nyou going to tell him to go? This is crazy.  Fucking crazy, man.\"\n\n\"Max,  let me handle it. \" Some quietude returned to  Pierre.   A\ndetermination  and resolve came from the confusion. \"Yeah,   I'll\ntake care of it.\"\n\n\"Mr.  Homosoto,  we need to speak.\"  Pierre showed  none  of  the\ninternational  politic that usually was second nature. He  called\nHomosoto at the San Jose Marriott later that afternoon.\n\n\"Of  course, Mr. Troubleaux.  I will see you shortly.\"   Homosoto\nhung up.\n\nWas  that a Japanese  yes for a yes, or a yes for  a no?   Pierre\nwasn't sure, but  he was sure  that he knew how to handle Homoso-\nto.  Homosoto didn't have the common courtesy to say he would not\nbe coming until the following morning.\n\nIn the plushness of Pierre's executive suite, Homosoto sat   with\nthe  same  shit  eating grin he had left  with  the  day  before.\nPierre hated that worse  than being called amigo.\n\n\"Mr.  Troubleaux, you asked to speak to me.  I assume  this  con-\ncerns  a matter of honor between two men.\"  Homosoto spoke  in  a\nmonotone as he sat stiffly.\n\n\"You're damned right it does.\" Pierre picked up the diskette from\nhis desk.  \"This disk, this disk . . .it's absolutely incredible.\nYou know  what's here, you know what kind of damage it can  cause\nand   you have the gall,  the nerve to come in here and  ask  me,\nno,  worse  yet, tell me to distribute these along  with  dGraph?\nYou're out of your mind, Mister.\"  Pierre was in a rage.  \"If you\nthink we're a bunch of pawns, to do your dirty little deeds,  you\nhave another thing coming.\"\n\nUnfazed, Homosoto rose slowly and started for the door.\n\n\"Where  do you think you're going? Hey, I asked you where  you're\ngoing?   I'm not finished with you yet.  Hey, fuck the deal.    I\ndon't want the goddamned money.  We'll stay private and wait  for\nsomeone  honest  to  come along.\"  Pierre was  speaking  just  as\nloudly with hand, arm and finger gestures.  While not all of  the\ngestures were obscene, there was no doubt about their meaning.\n\nHomosoto  spoke gently amidst Pierre's ranting. \"I will give  you\nsome  time to think about it.\"  With that, he left and  shut  the\ndoor in Pierre's bright red face.\n\nThree  days later DGI stock would be officially  unleashed   upon\nthe  public. Actually institutional buyers had already  committed\nto  vast  amounts of it, leaving precious little  for  the  small\ninvestor  before driving the price up.  That morning  Pierre  was\nlooking for Max.   They had a few last minute details to iron out\nfor   the  upcoming press conferences.  They had to  prepare  two\ntypes of statements.  One if the stock purchase went as expected,\nsold  out  almost instantly at or above the offering  price,  and\nanother  to explain the financial bloodbath if the  stock  didn't\nsell.   Unlikely, but their media advisors forced them  to  learn\nboth positions, just in case.\n\nHis  phone  rang.  \"Pierre, Mike Fields here.\" Fields  was  DGI's\nfinancial  media consultant.  He worked for the underwriters  and\nhad a strong vested interest in the outcome. He didn't sound like\na happy camper.\n\n\"Yes,  Mike.   All  ready for tomorrow? I'm so  excited  I  could\nburst,\"  Pierre pretended.\n\n\"Yes, so am I, but we have a problem.\"\n\nPierre immediately thought  of Homosoto.  \"What kind of  problem,\nMike?\" Pierre asked suspiciously.\n\n\"Uh, Max, Pierre, it's Max.\"\n\n\"What about Max?\"\n\n\"Pierre, Max is dead.  He died in a car crash last night.  I just\nfound out a few minutes ago. I gather you didn't know?\"\n\nOf  all  the possible pieces of bad news that Mike  Fields  could\nhave brought him, this was the farthest from his mind. Max  dead?\nNot possible.  Why, he was with him till after 10 last night.\n\n\"Max, dead?  No way.  What happened? I don't believe it.  This is\nsome kind of joke, right?\"\n\n\"Pierre,  I'm afraid I'm all too serious, unless CHiPs is  in  on\nit.  They found a car, pretty well burned up, at the bottom of  a\nravine  on I280.   Looks like he went through a barrier and  down\nthe, well . . .I . . .\"\n\n\"I get the idea, Mike. Who . . ?\" Pierre stuttered.\n\n\"It was an accident, Pierre. One of those dumb stupid  accidents.\nHe  may  have  had  a  blow out,  fallen  asleep  at  the  wheel,\noh  . . .it could be a million things.  Pierre, I am  sorry.   So\nsorry.   I  know what you guys meant to each other.  What  you've\nbeen through . . .\"\n\n\"Mike,  I have to go,\" Pierre whispered.  The tears were  welling\nup in his  eyes.\n\n\"Wait,  Pierre,\" Mike said gingerly. \"Of course we're  gonna  put\noff the offering until . . .\"\n\n\"No. Don't.\" Pierre said emphatically.\n\n\"Pierre,  your best friend and partner just died and you want  to\ngo through  with this . . .at least wait a week . . .Wall  Street\nwill be kind on this . . .\"\n\n\"I'll  call you later.  No changes.  None.\" Pierre hung  up.   He\nhung  his head on his desk, shattered with conflicting  emotions.\nHe was nothing without Max.  Sure, he gave great image. Knew  how\nto  do  the schtick.  Suck up to the press, tell a  few  stories,\nstretch  a few truths, all in the name of marketing,  of  course.\nBut  without Max, Max understood him.  Damn you Max  Jones.   You\ncan't do this to me.\n\nHis grief vacillated from anger to despair until the phone  rang.\nHe  ignored  the first 7 rings.  Maybe they would go  away.   The\ncaller persisted.\n\n\"Yes,\" he breathed  into the phone.\n\n\"Mr. Troubleaux,\" it was Homosoto.  Just what he needed now.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I  am  most sorry about your esteemed friend,  Max  Jones.   Our\nsympathies are  with you.     Is there anything I can do to  help\nyou  in this time of personal grief.\"   Classic Japanese  manners\noozed over the phone wire.\n\n\"Yeah.  Moral bankruptcy is a crime against nature, and you  have\nbeen  demonstrating an extreme talent for vivid androgynous  self\ngratification.\"  Pierre was rarely rude, but when he was, he aped\nRoyal British snobbery at their best.\n\n\"A physical impossibility, Mr. Troubleaux,\"  Homosoto said dryly.\n\"I  understand your feelings, and since it appears that I  cannot\nhelp  you,  perhaps we should conclude our  business.  Don't  you\nagree Mr. Troubleaux?\"  The condescension dripped from Homosoto's\nwords.   The previous empathy was gone as quickly as if  a  light\nhad been extinguished.\n\n\"Mr.  Homosoto, the offering will still go through,  tomorrow  as\nscheduled.  I assume that meets with your approval?\"  The  French\ncan be so caustic.  It makes them excellent taxi cab drivers.\n\n\"That  is  not the business to which I refer.   I  mean  business\nabout honor. I am  sure you remember our last conversation.\"\n\n\"Yes,   I remember, and the answer is still no.  No, no,  no.   I\nwon't do it.\"\n\n\"That  is  such  a  shame.   I hope  you  will  not  regret  your\ndecision.\"    There it was again, Pierre thought. Another  veiled\nthreat.\n\n\"Why should I?\"\n\n\"Simply,  and to the point as you Americans like it,  because  it\nwould  be  a terrible waste if the police obtained  evidence  you\nmurdered your partner for profit.\"\n\n\"Murdered?  What in hell's name are you talking about?\"   Crystal\nclear  visions  scorched  across Pierre's mind;  white  hot  fire\nspread  through  his cranium.  Was Homosoto right? Was  Max  mur-\ndered?  Searing heat etched patterns of pain in his brain.\n\n\"What  I mean, Mr. Troubleaux, is that there is  ample  evidence,\nenough  to convince any jury beyond a reasonable doubt, that  you\nmurdered  your partner as part of a grander scheme to make  your-\nself even richer than you will become tomorrow.  Do I make myself\nclear?\"\n\n\"You  bastard. Bastard,\" Pierre hissed into the phone.  Not  only\ndoes Homosoto kill Max, but he arranges to have Pierre look  like\nthe  guilty  party.   What choice did  he  have.  At  least  now.\nThere's no proof, is there? The police reports are apparently not\nready.  No autopsy.  Body burned? What could Homosoto do?\n\n\"Fuck you all  the way to Hell!\" Pierre screamed at the phone  in\nabject frustration and then slammed the receiver down so hard the\nimpact resistant plastic cracked.\n\nAt  that  same instant, Sheila Brandt, his  secretary,  carefully\nopened  the door his door. \"Pierre, I just heard. I am so  sorry.\nWhat  can I do?\" She genuinely felt for him.  The two had been  a\ngreat team, even if Pierre had become obsessed with himself.  Her\ndrawn  face with 40 years of intense sun worshiping  was  wracked\nwith emotional distress.\n\n\"Nothing   Sheil.    Thanks    though  .  .   .what   about   the\narrangements  . . .?\"  The helpless look on his face brought  out\nthe mother in her even though she was only a few years older.\n\n\"Being taken care of . . .do you want to . . .?\"\n\n\"No,  yes,  whatever  .  .  .that's  all  right,  just  keep   me\nadvised . . .\"\n\n\"Yessir.   Oh,  I hate to do this, but your  9AM  appointment  is\nwaiting.  Should I get rid  of him?\"\n\n\"Who is it?  Something I really care about  right now?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  He's from personnel.\"\n\n\"Personnel? Since when do I get involved in that?\"\n\n\"That's  all  I know. Don't worry I'll have him  come  back  next\nweek . . .\"   she said thinking she had just relieved her boss of\nan unnecessary burden that could wait.\n\n\"Sheil?  Send him in.  Maybe it'll get my mind off of this.\"\n\n\"If you're sure . . .\" Scott nodded at her affirmatively.  \"Sure,\nPierre, I'll send him in.\"\n\nAn elegantly dressed man, perhaps a dash over six feet, of  about\n30 entered.  He walked with absolute confidence.  If this guy was\napplying  for a job he was too well dressed for most of  DGI.  He\nlooked  more  like a tanned and rested Wall  Street  broker  than\na  . . .well whatever he was. The door closed behind him  and  he\ngrasped Pierre's hand.\n\n\"Good  morning Mr. Troubleaux.  My name is Thomas Hastings.   Why\ndon't  we  sit  for moment.\"  Their hands released  as  they  sat\nopposite  each other in matching chairs. Pierre sensed  that  Mr.\nHastings  was going to run the conversation.  So be it.  \"I am  a\nsoftware  engineer with 4 advanced degrees as well 2  PhD's  from\nCaltech  and  Polytechnique in Paris.  There are  34  US  patents\neither  in  my name alone or jointly along with  over  200  copy-\nrights.  I  have  an  MBA from  Harvard  and  speak  6  languages\nfluently . . .\"\n\nPierre  interrupted, \"I am impressed with your  credentials,  and\nyour clothes. What may I do for you.\"\n\n\"Oh  dear, I guess you don't know.  I am Max Jones'  replacement.\nMr. Homosoto sent me.  May I have the diskette please?\"\n\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe  financial  section of the New York City Times  included  two\npieces on the DGI offering.  One concerned the dollars and cents,\nand the was a related human interest story, with financial reper-\ncussions.  Max Jones, the co-founder of DGI, died in a car  acci-\ndent  2 days before the company was to go public.  It would  have\nearned him over $20 Million cash, with more to come.\n\nThe  article espoused the \"such a shame for the company\" tone  on\nthe loss of their technical wizard and co-founder.  It was a true\nloss  to the industry, as much as if Bill Gates had  died.   Max,\nthough, was more the Buddy Holly of software, while Gates was the\nArt  Garfunkle. The AP story, though, neglected to  mention  that\nthe San Jose police had not yet ruled out foul play.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Wednesday, September 1\n     New York City\n\nScott arrived in the City Room early to the surprise of Doug.  He\nwas a good reporter; he had the smarts, his writing was exemplary\nand he had developed a solid readership, but early hours were not\nhis strong point.\n\n\"I don't do mornings,\" Scott made clear to anyone who thought  he\nshould  function socially before noon.  If they didn't  take  the\nhint,  he behaved obnoxiously enough to convince anyone that  his\naversion to mornings should be taken seriously.\n\nDoug  noticed that Scott had a purpose in arriving so early.   It\nmust  be those damned files.  The pile of documents that  alleged\nAmerica was as crooked as the Mafia.  Good leads, admittedly, but\nproving  them  was going to be a bitch.  Christ, Scott  had  been\ngoing at them with a vengeance.  Let him have some rope.\n\nScott got down to business.  He first called  Robert Henson,  CEO\nof  Perris, Miller and Stevenson.  Scott's credentials as  a  re-\nporter  for  the New York City Times got him past  the  secretary\neasily.   Henson took the call; it was part of the job.\n\n\"Mr.  Henson?  This is Scott Mason from the Times.  I would  like\nto  get  a comment on the proposed Boston-Ellis  merger.\"   Scott\nsounded officious.\n\n\"Of  course, Mr. Mason.  How can I help?\"  Robert Henson  sounded\naccommodating.\n\n\"We  have  the press releases and stock quotes.   They  are  most\nuseful  and I am sure that they will be used.  But I  have  other\nquestions.\"  Scott hoped to mislead Henson into thinking he would\nask the pat questions he was expected to ask.\n\n\"Yes,  thank you.  My staff is very well prepared, and we try  to\ngive  the press adequate information. What do you  need?\"   Scott\ncould hear the smiling Henson ready to play the press game.\n\n\"Basically, Mr. Henson,  I have some documents that suggest  that\nyou  inflated the net earnings of Second Boston to such a  degree\nthat,  if, and I say, if, the deal goes through, your  firm  will\nearn  almost  one million dollars in extra  fees.   However,  the\nfigures I have do not agree at all with those filed with the SEC.\nWould you care to comment?\"  Scott tried not to sound accusatory,\nbut it was difficult not to play the adversary.\n\nHenson  didn't try to conceal the cough he suddenly developed  at\nthe  revelation.   \"Where,\" he choked,  \"where did you  get  that\ninformation?\"\n\n\"From a reliable source.  We are looking for a confirmation and a\ncomment.   We know  the data is correct.\"  Scott was playing  his\nKing, but he still held an Ace if he needed it.\n\n\"I  have no comment.  We have filed all required affidavits  with\nthe appropriate regulatory agencies.  If you need anything  else,\nthen I suggest you call them.\"  Henson was nervous and the  phone\nwires conveyed his agitation.\n\n\"I  assume, Mr. Henson, that you won't mind that I ask  them  why\nfiles  from your computer dispute figures you gave to  the  SEC?\"\nScott posed the question to give Henson an option.\n\n\"That's  not what I said,\" Henson said abruptly.  \"What  computer\nfigures?\"\n\n\"I  have a set of printouts that show that the  earnings  figures\nfor  Second Boston are substantially below those stated  in  your\nfilings.   Simple and dry.  Do you have a comment?\"  Scott  stuck\nwith the game plan.\n\n\"I . . .uh . . .am not familiar . . .with . . .the . . .ah . . .\"\nHenson  hesitated and then decided to go on the offensive.   \"You\nhave nothing.  Nothing.  It's a trap,\" Henson affirmed.\n\n\"Sir,  thank  you  for your time.\"  Scott hung  up  after  Henson\nrepeatedly denied any improprieties.\n\n\"This  is Scott Mason for Senator Rickfield.  I am with  the  New\nYork  City  Times.\"  Scott almost demanded  a  conversation  with\nWashington's  leading debunker of the Defense  Department's  over\nspending.\n\n\"May I tell the Senator what this is in reference to?\"  The  male\nsecretary matter of factly asked.\n\n\"Yes  of  course.\" Scott was overly polite.  \"General  Young  and\nCredit Suisse.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" the young aide asked innocently.\n\n\"That  will do.  I need a comment before I go to  print.\"   Scott\ncommanded an assurance that the aide was not used to hearing from\nthe press.\n\n\"Wait one moment please,\" the aide said.  A few seconds of  Muzak\non  hold bored Scott before Senator Merrill Rickfield  picked  up\nthe call.  He was belligerent.\n\n\"What the hell is this about?\" The senator demanded.\n\n\"Is that for the record?\"  Scott calmly asked.\n\n\"Is what for the record?  Who the hell is this?  You can't intim-\nidate me. I am a United States Senator.\"  The self assurance gave\naway nervousness.\n\n\"I mean no disrespect, Senator.  I am working on an article about\npolitical compromise.  Very simple.  I have information that  you\nand General Young, shall we say, have . . .an understanding.   As\na  member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, you  have  helped\npass  legislation  that gave you both what you  wanted.   General\nYoung got his weapons and you have a substantial bank account  in\nGeneva.  Comments, Senator?\"\n\nRickfield was beside himself but was forced to maintain a  formal\ncomposure.  \"Sir.  You have made some serious accusations,  slan-\nderous at least, criminal I suspect.  I hope you are prepared  to\nback  up these preposterous claims.\"  Scott heard desperation  in\nthe Senator's voice.\n\n\"Yessir,  I am.  I go to print, with or without  your  comments,\"\nScott  lied.  A prolonged pause followed.  The first  person  who\nspoke lost, so Scott busied himself with a crossword puzzle until\nRickfield spoke.\n\n\"If you  publish these absurdities, I will sue you and your paper\nright into bankruptcy.  Do you copy?\"\n\n\"I  copy  , Senator. Is that for attribution?\"  Scott  knew  that\nwould piss off Rickfield.  The line went dead.\n\nScott  made  similar  calls for a good part of the  day,  and  he\ncontinued to be amazed.\n\nFrom  call to call, the answers were the same.  \"How did you  get\nthat?\"  \"Where did you find out?\"  \"There's no way you could know\nthat.\"  \"I was the only one who had access to that . . .\"   \"That\nwas in my private files . . .\"\n\nBlue  Tower Nuclear Plant denied that Scott held  internal  memos\ninstructing safety engineers to withhold critical flaws from  the\nNuclear Regulatory Committee.   General Autos denied using  known\nfaulty  parts in Cruise Control mechanisms despite the fact  that\nScott held a copy of a SECRET internal memorandum.  He especially\nupset  the  Department of Defense when he asked them  how  Senors\nMendez and Rodriguez, CIA operatives, had set up Noriega.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control reacted with abject terror at  the\nthought  of seeing the name of thousands of AIDS victims  in  the\nnewspaper.  Never the less, the CDC refused to comfirm that their\nfiles  had  been  penetrated or any of the  names  on  the  list.\nUseless.\n\nEveryone he called gave him virtually the same story.  Above  and\nbeyond the official denial to any press; far from the  accusatory\nclaims  which were universally denied for a wide variety of  rea-\nsons, all of his contacts were, in his opinion, honestly  shocked\nthat he even had a hint of their alleged infractions.\n\nScott  Mason  began to feel he was part of a conspiracy,  one  in\nwhich everyone he called was a victim.  One in which he  received\nthe same formatted answer; more surprise than denial.\n\nScott  knew he was onto a story, but he had no idea what it  was.\nHe had in his possession damning data, from an anonymous  source,\nwith, thus far, no  way to get a confirmation.  Damn.  He  needed\nthat for the next time he got lawyered.\n\nWhen  he  presented his case to his editor, Scott's  worst  fears\nwere  confirmed. Doug McGuire decided that a bigger story was  in\nthe  making.  Therefore, we don't go.  Not yet. That's an  order.\nKeep digging.\n\n\"And while you're at it,\" Doug said with the pleasure of a father\nteasing  his son, \"follow this up, will you?  I need it by  dead-\nline.\"\n\nScott took the AP printout from Doug and read the item.\n\n\"No,\"  Scott gasped, \"not another virus!\"  He threw the paper  on\nhis desk.  \"I'm up to my ass in . . .\"\n\n\"Viruses,\" Doug said firmly, but grinning.\n\n\"Have a heart, these things are such bullshit.\"\n\n\"Then say so.  But say something.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 7\n     Thursday, September 17\n     New York City Times\n\n     Christopher Columbus Brings Disease to America\n     By Scott Mason\n\nHere's a story I can't resist, regardless of the absurdity of the\nheadline.

As for the last several years, that is  the  anticipated\ndate for a highly viral computer virus to 'explode'.  The history\nbehind the headline reads from an Ian Fleming novel.\n\nIn  late 1988, a group of West German hackers and  computer  pro-\ngrammers thought it would be great fun to build their own comput-\ner  virus.  As my regular readers recall, a computer virus is  an\nunsolicited  and unwanted computer program whose sole purpose  is\nto wreak havoc in computers. Either by destroying important files\nor otherwise damaging the system.\n\nWe  now know that that these Germans are part of  an  underground\ngroup  known  as CHAOS, an acronym for Computer  Hackers  Against\nOpen Systems, whatever the heck that means.  They work to promote\ncomputer systems disruption worldwide.\n\nIn  March  of 1989, Amsterdam, Holland, hosted  an  international\nconference of computer programmers.  Are you ready for the  name?\nIntergalactic Hackers Conference.  Some members were aware of the\nplanned  virus.   As a result of the negative  publicity  hackers\nhave  gotten  over the last few years, the  Conference  issued  a\nstatement  disavowing  the propagation and creation  of  computer\nviruses.   All  very honorable by a group of  people  whose  sole\npurpose in life is to invade the privacy of others.  But,  that's\nwhat they said.\n\nSomewhere, somehow, something went wrong, and the CHAOS virus got\nreleased at the Intergalactic Hackers meetings.  In other  words,\nfiles and programs, supposedly legitimate ones, got corrupted  by\nthis disreputable band, and the infections began spreading.\n\nThe  first outbreak of the Columbus Day Virus occurred  in  1989,\nand caused millions of dollars of down computer time, reconstruc-\ntion of data banks and system protection.\n\nAgain  we are warned, that the infection has continued to  spread\nand  that  some strains of the virus are programmed  to  detonate\nover a period of years.  The Columbus Day Virus is called by  its\ncreators,  the \"Data Crime Virus\", a name befitting its  purpose.\nWhen it strikes, it announces itself to the computer user, and by\nthat time, it's too late.  Your computer is kaput!\n\nWhat  makes this particular computer virus any  more  tantalizing\nthan the hundred or so that have preceded it?  The publicity  the\nmedia has given it, each and every year since 1989.\n\nThe Data Crime, aka Columbus Day Virus has, for some  inescapable\nreason attracted the attention of CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC and hundreds\nof newspapers including this one.  The Associated Press and other\nreputable  media have, perhaps due to slow news weeks, focused  a\ngreat  deal of attention on this anticipated technological  Arma-\ngeddon.\n\nOf course there are other experts who pooh-pooh the entire  Virus\nissue  and see it as an over-exploited media event  propelled  by\nVirus  Busters.  Sam Moscovitz of Computer Nook in Dallas,  Texas\ncommented,  \"I have never seen a virus in 20 years.   I've  heard\nabout  them  but really think they are a figment of  the  media's\nimagination.\"\n\nVirus  Busters  are people or firms who  specialize  in  fighting\nalleged computer viruses by creating and selling so-called  anti-\ndotes.   Virus  Busting Sean McCullough, President of  The  Virus\nInstitute  in San Jose, California thinks that most  viruses  are\nharmless and users and companies overreact.  \"There have been  no\nmore  that  a few dozen viral outbreaks in the  last  few  years.\nThey spread more by rumor than by infection.\"  When asked how  he\nmade  his  living, he responded, \"I sell  antidotes  to  computer\nviruses.\"  Does he make a good living?  \"I can't keep up with the\ndemand,\" he insists.\n\nThe  Federal Government, though, seems concerned, and  maybe  for\ngood  reason.  On October 13,  another NASA space shuttle  launch\nis planned.  Friday the 13th is another date that computer  virus\nmakers use as the intended date of destruction.  According to  an\nofficial spokesman, NASA has called in computer security  experts\nto  make sure that their systems are \" . . .clean and  free  from\ninfection.  It's a purely precautionary move, we are not worried.\nThe launch will continue as planned.\"\n\nViruses.  Are they real?  Most people believe they are real,  and\ndangerous, but that chances of infection are low.  As one  highly\nrespected computer specialist put it, \"The Columbus Day Virus  is\na  low risk high consequence possibility.  I don't recommend  any\npanic.\"  Does he protect his own computer agaist viruses?  \"Abso-\nlutely.  I can't risk losing my computers.\"\n\nCan  anybody?  Until October 12, this is Scott Mason,  hoping  my\ncomputer never needs Tylenol.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Scarsdale, New York.\n\nThe Conrail  trains were never on time.\n\nScott  Mason regularly tried to make it to the station  to   ride\nthe 7:23 from the wealthy Westchester town of Scarsdale, New York\ninto  Grand Central Station.  If he made it. It was a  32  minute\nride into the City on good days and over 2 hours  when the feder-\nally subsidized rail service was under Congressional scrutiny.\n\nThe  ritual  was simple.  He fell into his old  Porsche  911,  an\nupscale  version of a station car, and drove the 2 miles  to  the\nScarsdale train station.  He bought a large styrofoam cup full of\ndecent  black coffee and 3 morning papers from the blind  newsman\nbefore boarding the express train.  Non-stop to Harlem, and  then\non to 42nd St. and Park Avenue and wake up time.\n\nTyrone  Duncan followed a similar routine.  Except he  drove  his\nsilver  BMW  850i to the station.  The FBI provided  him  with  a\nperfectly  good  Ford Fairlane  with 78,000 miles on it  when  he\nneeded a car in New York.   He was one of the few black commuters\nfrom  the affluent bedroom community and his size made  him  more\nconspicuous than his color.\n\nScott  and Tyrone were train buddies.  Train buddies are  perhaps\nunique in the commuterdom of the New York suburbs. Every  morning\nyou  see the same group of drowsy, hung over executives on  their\nway  to the Big Apple.  The morning commute is a personal  solace\nfor  many.  Your train buddy knows if you got laid and  by  whom.\nIf  you tripped over your kids toys in the driveway,  your  train\nbuddy knew.  If work was a bitch, he knew before the wife.  Train\nbuddies  are  buddies to the death or the  bar,  whichever  comes\nfirst.\n\nWhile  Scott and Tyrone had been traveling the same  the  morning\nroute  since  Scott had joined the paper, they had  been  friends\nsince  their wives introduced them at the Scarsdale Country  Club\n10  years  ago.  Maggie Mason and Arlene Duncan  were  opoosites;\nMaggie,  a giggly, spacey and spontaneous girl of 24 and  Arlene,\nthe dedicated wife of a civil servant and mother of three  daugh-\nters  who  were going to toe the line, by  God.   The  attachment\nbetween the two was not immediately explainable, but it gave both\nScott and Ty a buddy with their wives' blessing.\n\nThe  physical  contrast  between the two was  comical  at  times.\nDuncan  was a 240 pound six foot four college linebacker who  had\nlet  his considerable bulk accumulate around the middle.   Scott,\nsmall and wiry was 10 years Ty's junior.  On weekends they played\non  a very amateur local basketball league where minimum age  was\nthirty  five,  but there, Scott consistently out  maneuvered  Ty-\nrone's bulk.\n\nDuring  the week, Tyrone dressed in impeccable Saville Row  suits\nhe  had made in London while Scott's uniform was jeans,  sneakers\nand  T-Shirt of choice.  His glowing skull, more dark brown  than\nebony, with fringes of graying short hair emphasized the  usually\njovial face that was described as a cross between rolly-polly and\nbulbous.  Scott on the other hand, always seemed to need a  hair-\ncut.\n\nCoffee  in hand, Tyrone plopped down opposite Scott as the  train\npulled out of the open air station.\n\n\"You must be in some mood,\" Tyrone said laughing.\n\nScott laid down his newspaper and vacantly asked why.\n\n\"That  shirt,\" Ty smirked.  \"A lesson in how to make friends  and\ninfluence people.\"\n\n\"Oh, this?\"  Scott looked down at the words on his chest:\n\n               I'm O.K.\n          You're A Shithead.\n\n\"It only offends them that oughta be offended.\"\n\n\"Shitheads?\"\n\n\"Shitheads.\"\n\n\"Gotcha,\" Ty said sarcastically. \"Right.\"\n\n\"My  mother,\"  groused Scott.  \"VCR lessons.\"  Ty  didn't  under-\nstand.\n\n\"I gave my mom a VCR last Christmas,\" Scott continued. \"She ooh'd\nand ah'd and I thought great, I got her a decent present. Well, a\ncouple  of weeks later I went over to her place and I  asked  how\nshe  liked the VCR.  She didn't answer, so I asked again and  she\nmumbled that she hadn't used it yet.  I fell down,\" Scott laughed\nout loud.\n\n\"'Why?'  I  asked her and she said she wanted to get used  to  it\nsitting  next  to her TV for a couple of months before  she  used\nit.\"  Tyrone caught a case of Scott's roaring laughter.\n\n\"Wheeee!\" exclaimed Tyrone.  \"And you an engineer?\"\n\n\"Hey,\"  Scott settled down, \"my mom calls 911 to change a  light-\nbulb.\"   They laughed until Scott could speak.  \"So last night  I\nwent over for her weekly VCR lesson.\"\n\n\"If it's anything like Arlene's mother,\" Tyrone giggled,  \"trust-\ning  a machine to do something right, when you're not  around  to\nmake sure it is right, is an absolutely terrifying thought.  They\ndon't believe it works.\"\n\n\"It's  a lot of fun actually,\" Scott said fondly.  \"It  tests  my\nability to reduce things to the basics.  The real basics.  Trying\nto teach a seventy year old widower about digital is like  trying\nto get a square ball bearing to roll.\"\n\nEven so, Scott looked forward to those evenings with his mom.  He\ncouldn't  imagine it, the inability to understand the  simplicity\nof  either 'on' or 'off'.  But he welcomed the tangent  conversa-\ntions  that invariably resulted when he tried to explain how  the\nVCR  could record one channel and yes mom, you can watch  another\nchannel at the same time.\n\nScott  never  found  out that his mother  deprogrammed  the  VCR,\ncleared  its  memory and 'Twelved' the clock an  hour  before  he\narrived to show her how to use it.  And after he left, she repro-\ngrammed it for her tastes only to erase it again before his  next\nvisit.  If he had ever discovered her ruse it would  have  ruined\nher  little game and the ritual starting point for their  private\ntalks.\n\n\"By  the  way,\" Scott said to Tyrone. \"What are  you  and  Arlene\ndoing Sunday night?\"\n\n\"Sunday?  Nothing, why?\"  Tyrone asked innocently.\n\n\"My mom is having a little get together and she'd love the two of\nyou . . .\"\n\n\"Is this another one of her seances?\" Tyrone asked pointedly.\n\n\"Well, not in so many words, but it's always possible . . .\"\n\n\"Forget  it.\"  Tyrone said stubbornly.  \"Not after what  happened\nlast  time.  I don't think I could get Arlene within 20 miles  of\nyour  mother.  She scared the living shit out of her . .  .and  I\nhave my doubts.\"\n\n\"Relax,\" Scott said calmly.  \"It's just her way of keeping  busy.\nSome people play bingo, others play bridge . . .\"\n\n\"And  your mother shakes the rafters trying to raise her  husband\nfrom the dead,\" said Scott with exaperation.  \"I don't care  what\nyou  say,  that's  not normal.  I like your  mother,  but,  well,\nArlene  has put her foot down.\"  Tyrone shuddered at the  thought\nof  that evening.  No one could explain how the  wooden  shutters\nblew  open or the table wobbled.  Tyrone preferred, just  as  his\nwife did, to pretend it never happened.\n\n\"Hey,\"  Tyrone said with his head back behind the newspaper.   \"I\nsee you're making a name for yourself elsewhere, too.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Scott asked.\n\n\"Don't give me that innocent shit.  I'm a trained  professional,\"\nTyrone  joked.    He held up the New York City  Times  turned  to\nScott's Christopher Columbus article. \"Your computer crime pieces\nhave  been raising a few eyebrows down at the office.  Seems  you\nhave better sources than we do.  Our Computer Fraud division  has\nbeen going nuts recently.\"\n\n\"Glad you can read.\"  Scott enjoyed the compliment.  \"Just a job,\nbut I gotta story much more interesting.  I can't publish it yet,\nthough.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Damn  lawyers want us to have our facts straight.  Can  you  be-\nlieve  it?\"  Scott teased Tyrone.  \"Besides, blackmail is so,  so\npersonal.\"\n\nTyrone  stopped in mid-sip of his hot coffee.  \"What  blackmail?\"\nThe  frozen visage caught Scott off guard.  They rarely spoke  of\ntheir  respective jobs in any detail, preferring to remain  at  a\nmeasured professional distance.  The years of dedication invested\nin their friendship, even after to everyones' surprise, Maggie up\nand  left for California were not to be put in jeoprady  unneces-\nsarily.  Thus far their interests had not sufficiently overlapped\nto be of concern.\n\n\"It's a story, that, well, doesn't have enough to go into  print,\nbut, it's there, I know it. Off the record, ok?\" Scott wanted  to\ntalk.\n\n\"Mums the word.\"\n\n\"A  few days ago I received some revealing documents papers on  a\ncertain company.  I can't say which one.\" He looked at Tyrone for\napproval.\n\n\"Whatever,\" Tyrone urged anxiously.\n\nScott told Tyrone about his nameless and faceless donor and  what\nHiggins had said about the McMillan situation and the legality of\nthe apparently purloined information.  Tyrone listened in  fasci-\nnation  as Scott outline a few inner sanctum secrets to which  he\nwas privy.\n\nTyrone got a shiver up his spine.  He tried to disguise it.\n\n\"Can I ask you a question?\"  Tyrone quietly asked.\n\n\"Sure. Go for it.\"\n\n\"Was one of the companies Amalgamated General?\"\n\nScott shot Tyrone a look they belied the answer.\n\n\"How did you know?\"  Scott asked suspiciously.\n\n\"And  would another be First Federated or State  National  Bank?\"\nTyrone tried to subdue his concern.  All he needed was the  press\non this.\n\nScott could not hide his surprise.  \"Yeah! And a bunch of others.\nHow'd you know?\"\n\nTyrone  retreated back into his professional FBI persona.  \"Lucky\nguess.\"\n\n\"Bullshit.  What's up?\" Scott's reporter mindset replaced that of\nthe lazy commuter.\n\n\"Nothing, just a coincidence.\"  Tyrone picked up a newspaper  and\nburied his face behind it.\n\n\"Hey, Ty.  Talk ol' buddy.\"\n\n\"I can't and you know it.\" Tyrone sounded adamant.\n\n\"As a friend?  I'll buy you a lollipop?\" Scott joked.\n\nTy  snickered. \"You know the rules, I can't talk about a case  in\nprogress.\"\n\n\"So there is a case? What is it?\" Scott probed.\n\n\"I didn't say that there was a case,\" Ty countered.\n\n\"Yes you did.  Case in progress were your words, not mine.  C'mon\nwhat's up?\"\n\n\"Shit,  you media types.\"  Tyrone gave himself a few  seconds  to\nthink.  \"I'll never know why you became a reporter.  You used  to\nbe  a  much  nicer pain in the ass before you  became  so  nosy.\"\nScott sat silently, enjoying Ty's awkwardness.\n\nTyrone hated to compromise the  sanctity of his position, but  he\nrealized  that he, too, needed some help.  Since he  hadn't  read\nany of this in the papers, there had to be journalistic responsi-\nbility from both Scott and the paper. \"Off, off, off the  record.\nClear?\"  He was serious.\n\n\"Done.\"\n\nThe train rumbled into the tunnel at the Northern tip of  Manhat-\ntan. They had to raise their voices to hear each other, but  that\nmeant they couldn't be heard either.\n\n\"As  near  as I can tell,\" Tyrone hesitantly began.   \"There's  a\nwell coordinated nationwide blackmail operation in progress.   As\nof yesterday, we have received almost a hundred cases of  alleged\nblackmail. From  Oshkosh, Baton Rouge, New York, Miami,  Atlanta,\nChicago,  LA,  the works.  Small towns to the  metros.   It's  an\nepidemic  and  the local and state cops  are  absolutely  buried.\nThey  can't handle it, and besides it's way out of their  league.\nSo  who do they all call? Us. Shit. I need this, right?   There's\nno  way we can handle this many cases at once.  No way.  Washing-\nton's going berserk.\"\n\n\"Who's  behind it?\"  Scott asked knowing he wouldn't get  a  real\nanswer.\n\n\"That's  the  rub.  Don't have a clue.  Not a clue.   There's  no\npattern, none at all.  We assumed it was organized crime, but our\ninformants  say they're baffled.  Not the mob, they swear.   They\nknew about it before we did.  Figures.\"  Tyrone's voice echoed  a\nprofessional frustration.\n\n\"Motives?\"\n\n\"None. We're stuck.\"\n\n\"Sounds like we're both on the same hunt.\"\n\nThe  train  slowed to a crawl and then a hesitant stop  at  Grand\nCentral.   Thousands  of commuters lunged at the  doors  to  make\ntheir  escape to the streets of New York above them.  Scott  won-\ndered if any of  them were part of Duncan's problems.\n\n\"Scott?\"  Tyrone queried on the escalator.\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Not a word, ok?\"\n\nScott  held  up  his right hand  with  three  fingers.   \"Scott's\nhonor!\" That was good enough for Tyrone.\n\nThey  walked up the stairs and past a newsstand that caught  both\nof their eyes instantly.  The National Expose had another  sensa-\ntionalistic  headline:\n\n     FBI POWERLESS IN NATIONAL BLACKMAIL SCHEME\n\nThey fought for who would pay the 75 cents for the scandal filled\ntabloid, bought two, and started reading right where they stood.\n\n\"Jesus,\"  Tyrone  said more breathing than  actually  saying  the\nword.   \"They're going to make a weekly event of  printing  every\ninnuendo.\"\n\n\"They have the papers, too,\" muttered Scott.  \"The whole  blasted\nlot.  And  they're  printing them.\"  Scott put  down  the  paper.\n\"This makes it a brand new ball game . . .\"\n\n\"Just what I need,\" Tyrone said with disgust.\n\n\"That's  the answer,\" exclaimed Scott.  \"The motive.  Who's  been\naffected so far?\"\n\n\"That's the mystery. No one seems to have been affected.   What's\nthe  answer?\" Tyrone demanded loud enough to  attract  attention.\n\"What's the answer?\" he whispered up close.\n\n\"It's you.\"  Scott noted.\n\nTyrone expressed surprise.  \"What do you mean, me.\"\n\n\"I mean, it seems that the FBI has been affected more than anyone\nelse.  You said you're overloaded, and that you can't pay  atten-\ntion to other crimes.\"\n\n\"You're  jumping to conclusions.\"  Tyrone didn't  follow  Scott's\nreasoning and cocked his head quizzically.\n\n\"What  if the entire aim of the blackmail was to so overwork  the\nFBI, so overload it with useless cases, and that the perpetrators\nreally  have other crimes in mind.  Maybe they have  already  hit\ntheir real targets.  Isn't it possible that the FBI is an unwill-\ning  dupe,  a decoy in a much larger scheme  that  isn't  obvious\nyet?\"   Scott  liked the sound of his thinking and  he  saw  that\nTyrone wasn't buying his argument.\n\n\"It's  possible, I guess . . .but . . .\" Tyrone didn't  have  the\nwords  to finish his foggy thoughts.  It was too far  left  field\nfor  his  linear  thinking.  \"No this is crazy as  the  time  you\nthough  that UFO's were invading Westchester in '85.  Then  there\nwas the time you said that Columbian drug dealers put cocaine  in\nthe water supply . . .\"\n\n\"That wasn't my fault . . .\"\n\n\"  . . .and the Trump Noriega connection and the other  500  wild\nass conspiracies you come up with.\"\n\nScott  dismissed  Tyrone's  friendly criticism  by  ignoring  the\nderisions.   \"As I see it,\" Scott continued, \"the only victim  is\nthe  FBI.   None of the alleged victims have been  harmed,  other\nthan ego and their paranoia levels. Maybe the FBI was the  target\nall  along.    Scott  suggested, \"it's as good a  theory  as  any\nother.\"\n\n\"With what goal?\"  Duncan accepted the logic for the moment.\n\n\"So  when  the  real thing hits, you guys are too  fucked  up  to\nreact.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation\n     Federal Square, Manhattan.\n\nThe flat white and glass square building, designed in the  '60's,\nbuilt shoddily by the lowest bidder in 1981, in no way echoed the\nlevel of technical sophistication hidden behind the drab  exteri-\nor.     The  building had no personality, no  character,  nothing\nmemorable  about  it, and that was exactly the way  the   tenants\nwanted it.\n\nThe 23 story building extended 6 full floors below the  congested\nstreets of Lower Manhattan. Throughout the entire structure  well\nguarded  mazes held the clues to the locations of  an  incredible\narray  of  computing power, some of the world's  best  analytical\ntools,  test equipment, forensic labs, communications  facilities\nand  a  staff  of experts in hundreds  of  technical  specialties\nrequired to investigate crimes that landed in their jurisdiction.\n\nThe  most sensitive work was performed underground, protected  by\nthe solid bedrock of Manhattan island.  Eavesdropping was  impos-\nsible, almost, and operational privacy was guaranteed.   Personal\nprivacy  was  another matter, though.  Most of the  office  staff\nworked  out  in an open office floorplan. The walls  between  the\nguard stations and banks of elevators consisted solely of bullet-\nproof floor to ceiling triple pane glass.  Unnerving at first, no\nprivacy.\n\nThere  was  a self-imposed class structure  between  the  \"bugs\",\nthose who worked in the subterranean chambers and the \"air-heads\"\nwho worked where the daylight shone.  There was near total  sepa-\nration  between the two groups out of necessity; maintain  isola-\ntion  between  those with differing need-to-know  criteria.   The\nmost  visible  form  of self-imposed  isolation,  and  unintended\ncompetitiveness was that each camp spent Happy Hour at  different\nbars.  A line that was rarely crossed.\n\nUnlike  the mechanism of the Corporate Ladder, where  the  higher\nfloors  are reserved for upper, top, elite management, the  power\nbrokers, at the FBI the farther down into the ground you  worked,\nthe more important you were.  To the \"airheads\", \"bugs\" tried  to\nsee  how low they could sink in their acquisition of power  while\nrising up on the Government pay scale.\n\nOn  level  5, descending from street level 1, Tyrone sat  on  the\nedge  of his large Government issue executive desk to answer  his\nringing  phone.  It was Washington, Bob Burnsen,  his  Washington\nbased  superior and family friend for years.\n\n\"No,  really. Thanks,\" Ty smiled.  \"Bob, we've been through  this\nbefore.  It's all very flattering, but no.  I'm afraid not.   And\nyou  know why.  We've been through this all . . .\"  He was  being\ncut off by his boss, so he shut up and listened.\n\n\"Bob  .  .  .Bob . . .Bob,\" Tyrone was laughing as  he  tried  to\ninterrupt  the other end of the conversation. \"OK, I'll  give  it\nsome more thought, but don't get your hopes up.  It's just not in\nmy cards.\"  He listened again.\n\n\"Bob,  I'll speak to Arlene again, but she feels the same  way  I\ndo.   We're  both  quite content and frankly, I  don't  need  the\nheadaches.\"  He looked around the room as he cocked the  earpiece\naway from his head. He was hearing the same argument again.\n\n\"Bob,  I said  I would.  I'll call  you next week.\"   He  paused.\n\"Right. If you don't hear from me, you'll call me. I  understand.\nRight.  OK, Bob. All right, you too. Goodbye.\"\n\nHe  hung  up the phone in disbelief.  They just  won't  leave  me\nalone.  Let  me be! He clasped his hands in mock  prayer  at  the\nceiling.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTyrone Duncan joined the FBI in 1968, immediately after  graduat-\ning  cum  laude from Harvard Law.  Statistically  the  odds  were\nagainst  him ever being accepted into the elite  National  Police\nForce.  The virtually autonomous empire that J. Edgar Hoover  had\ncreated  over 60 years and 12 presidents ago was very   selective\nabout whom it admitted.  Tyrone Duncan was black.\n\nHis  distinguished  pre-law training had him prepared  to  follow\ninto  his father's footsteps, as a partner with one  of  Boston's\nmost  prestigious law firms.  Tyrone was a member of one  of  the\nvery  few rich and influential black families in the North  East.\nHis  family was labeled \"Liberal\" when one wasn't ashamed of  the\nmoniker.\n\nThen  came  Selma.    At 19, he participated in  several  of  the\nmarches  in  the  South and it was then that he  first  hand  saw\nprejudice. But it was more than prejudice, though.  It was  hate,\nit  was ignorance and fear.  It was so much more than  prejudice.\nIt  was  one of the last vestiges left over from a  society  con-\nquered  over a century ago; one that wouldn't let go of its  mis-\nguided myopic traditions.\n\nFear  and hate are contagious. Fueled by the oppressive heat  and\nhumidity,  decades  of racial conflict, several 'Jew  Boy  Nigger\nLovers'  were  killed that summer in Alabama. The murder  of  the\ncivil  rights workers made front page news. The country was  out-\nraged, at the murders most assuredly, but national outrage turned\nquickly to divisional disgust when local residents dismissed  the\ncrime  as  a prank, or even congratulated  the  perpetrators  for\ntheir actions.\n\nThe  FBI was not called in to Alabama to solve murders,  per  se;\nmurder  is  not a federal crime.  They were to  solve  the  crime\nbecause  the  murderers had violated the victims'  civil  rights.\nTyrone  thought that that approach was real slick, a  nice  legal\nside  step  to get what you want. Put the lawyers  on  the  case.\nWhen  he asked the FBI if they could use a hand, the local  over-\nworked,  understaffed agents graciously accepted his  offer   and\nTyrone  spent the remainder of the summer filing papers and  per-\nforming other mundane tasks while learning a great deal.\n\nOn  the  plane  back to Boston, Tyrone Duncan  decided  that  his\ndespite  his father's urging, after law school he would join  the\nFBI.\n\nTyrone Duncan, graduate cum laude, GPA 3.87, Harvard Law  School,\npassed  the  Massachussettes  Bar on the  first  try  and  sailed\nthrough the written and physical tests for FBI admission. He  was\nover 100 pounds lighter than his current weight.  His  background\ncheck was unassailable except for his family's prominent  liberal\nbent.   He had every basic qualification needed to become an  FBI\nAgent.  He was turned down.\n\nThurman  Duncan, his prominent lawyer father was beside  himself,\nblaming it on Hoover personally.  But Tyrone decided to 'investi-\ngate'  and  determine  who or what was pulling  the  strings.  He\ncalled  FBI personnel and asked why he had been  rejected.   They\nmumbled something about 'experience base' and 'fitting the mold'.\nThat was when he realized that he was turned down solely  because\nhe  was black. Tyrone was not about to let a  racial issue  stand\nin his way.\n\nHe located a couple of the agents with whom he had worked  during\nthe  last summer.  After the pleasantries, Tyrone told them  that\nhe  was  applying for a position as an assistant  DA  in  Boston.\nWould  they mind writing a letter . . .\n\nTyrone Duncan was right on time at the office of the FBI  Person-\nnel Director.  Amazing, Tyrone thought, the resemblance to  Hoov-\ner.   The  four letters of recommendation, which read  more  like\nvotes for sainthood were a little overdone, but, they were on FBI\nstationary.   Tyrone asked the Personnel  Director if they  would\nreconsider  his  application,  and that if  necessary,  he  would\nwhitewash his skin.\n\nThe following day Tyrone received a call.  Oh, it was a big  mix-\nup.   We misfiled someone else's charts in your files and,  well,\nyou understand, I'm sure.  It happens all the time.  We're  sorry\nfor  any  inconvenience.  Would you be available to  come  in  on\nMonday? Welcome to the FBI.\n\nTyrone paid his dues early.  Got shot at some, chased long haired\nleft  wing hippie radicals who blew up gas stations in 17  states\nfor  some unfathomable reason, and then of course,  he  collected\ndirt  on imaginary enemies to feed the Hoover Nixon paranoia.  He\ntried,  fairly successfully to stay away from that last  kind  of\nwork.  In Tyrone's not so humble opinion, there were a whole  lot\nmore  better things for FBI agents to be doing than  worry  about\nGeorge McGovern's toilet habits or if some left wing high  school\nkids  and their radical newspaper were imaginarily linked to  the\nKremlin.  Ah, but that was politics.\n\nThree weeks after J. Edgar Hoover died, Tyrone Duncan was promot-\ned  to Section Chief in the New York City office.  A  prestigious\nposition.  This was his first promotion in 8 years at the bureau.\nIt  was one that leaped over 4 intermediate levels.   The  Hoover\nera  was gone.\n\nAfter  hanging up the phone with Bob Bernsen, Tyrone  sat  behind\nhis desk going over his morning reports.  No planes hijacked,  no\nnew counterfeiting rings and nary a kidnapping.  What dogged  him\nthough was the flurry of blackmail and extortion claims.  He  re-\nread the digested version put out by Washington headquarters that\nwas faxed to him in the early hours, ready for his A.M. perusal.\n\nThe apparent facts confounded his years of experience.  Over  100\npeople,  many of them highly placed leaders of American  industry\nhad called their respective regional FBI offices for help. A call\ninto  the FBI is handled in a procedural manner.   The agent  who\ntakes the call can identify the source of the call with a readout\non  his special phone;  a service that the FBI had had for  years\nbut was only recently becoming available to the public.  Thus, if\nthe  caller had significant information, but refused to  identify\nhimself, the agent had a reliable method to track down the  call-\ner.   Very  few people who called the FBI realized that  a  phone\ninquiry to an FBI office triggered a sequence of automatic events\nthat was complete before the call was over.\n\nThe phone call was of course monitored and taped.  And the  phone\nnumber of the caller was logged in the computer and displayed  to\nthe  agent. Then the number was crosschecked against  files  from\nthe  phone company.  What was the exact location of  the  caller?\nTo whom was the phone registered?  A calling and billing  history\nwas made instantly available if required.\n\nIf the call originated from a phone  registered to an individual,\nhis  social security number was retrieved and within  seconds  of\nthe receipt of the call, the agent knew a plethora of information\nabout  the caller.  Criminal activities, bad credit records;  the\ntype of data that would permit the agent to gauge the validity of\nthe call.  For business phones, a cross check determined any  and\nall dubious dealings that might be valuable in such a  determina-\ntion.\n\nThus,  the profile that emerged from the vast number  of  callers\nwho intimated blackmail activities created a ponderous situation.\nThey all, to a call, originated from the office or home of  major\ncorporate  movers  and shakers.  Top  American  businessmen  who,\nwhile not beyond the reach of the law, were from the FBI's  view,\nupstanding  citizens.   Not pristine, but certainly not  mad  men\nwith a record of making outlandish capricious claims.  It was not\nin their interest to bring attention to themselves.\n\nWhat  puzzled  Tyrone, and Washington, was the sudden  influx  of\nsuch calls.  Normally the Bureau handles a handful of diversified\ncases of blackmail, and a very small percentage of those pan  out\ninto  legitimate  and solvable cases.   Generally,  veiled  vague\nthreats do not materialize into prosecutable cases. Tyrone Duncan\nsat back thoughtfully.\n\nWhat is the common element here? Why today, and not a year ago or\non April Fools Day?  Do these guys all play golf together?  Is it\na joke?  Not likely, but a remote possibility.  What enemies have\nthey  made?   Undoubtedly they haven't befriended  everyone  with\nwhom they have had contact,  but what's the connection?  Tyrone's\nmind  reeled  through a maze of unlikelihoods.  Until,  the  only\ncommon  element  he could think of  stared at him  right  in  the\nface.  There was a single dimension of commonality between all of\nthe  callers.  They had, to a company, to a man, all  dealt  with\nthe same organization for years.  The U.S. Government.\n\nThe thought alone caused a spasm to his system.  His body  liter-\nally  leapt  from his chair for a split second as he  caught  his\nbreath.   The  government.  No way. Is it possible?   I  must  be\nmissing  something, surely.  This is crazy.  Or is  it?   Doesn't\nthe  IRS  have records on everyone?  Then the  ultimate  paranoid\nthought  hit him square in the cerebellum.  He playfully  pounded\nhis forehead for missing the connection.\n\nSomewhere, deep in the demented mind of some middle management G-\n9  bureaucrat, Duncan thought, an idea germinated that  he  could\nsell  to another overworked, underpaid civil servant;  his  boss.\nThe G-9 says, 'I got a way to make sure the tax evaders pay their\nshare,  and it won't cost Uncle Sam a dime!'.  His boss says,  'I\ngot  a  congressional hearing today, I'm too busy.  Do  some  re-\nsearch and let me see a report.'\n\nSo this overzealous tax collector prowls around other  government\ncomputers  and  determines  that the companies on  his  hit  list\naren't necessarily functioning on the up and up.  What better way\nto get them to pay their taxes than to let them know that we, the\nbig We, Big Brother know, and they'd better shape up.\n\nHe  calls a few of them, after all he knows where  the  skeletons\nand  the phone numbers are buried, and says something like,  'Big\nBrother is listening and he doesn't like what he hears.'   And he\nsays, 'we'll call you back soon, real soon, so get your ducks  in\na  row'  and that scares the shit out of the  corporate  muckity-\nmucks.\n\nTyrone smiled to himself.  What an outlandish theory.  Absurd, he\nadmitted,  but  it was the only one he could say fit  the  facts.\nStill,  is it possible?  The government was certainly capable  of\nsome  pretty bizarre things.  He recalled the Phoenix program  in\nViet  Nam where suspected Viet Cong and innocent  civilians  were\ntossed  out  of helicopters at 2000 feet to their deaths  in  the\ndistorted hope of making another one talk.\n\nWasn't  Daniel Ellsburg a government target?  And  the  Democrats\nwere  in  1972 targets of CREEP, the Committee  to  Re-Elect  the\nPresident.   And  the Aquarius project used  psychics  to  locate\nSoviet  Boomers  and UFO's.  Didn't we give LSD  to  unsuspecting\nsoldiers  to  see  if they could function  adequately  under  the\ninfluence? The horror stories swirled through his mind. And  they\nbecame more and more unbelievable, yet they were all true.  Maybe\nit  was  possible.   The United States  government  had  actually\ninstituted a program of anonymous blackmail in order to  increase\ntax revenues.  Christ, I hope I'm wrong. But, I'm probably not.\n\nThe  buzzer on the intercom of his phone jarred Tyrone  from  his\ndaydream speculations.\n\n\"Yes?\"  He answered into space.\n\n\"Mr. Duncan, a Franklin Dobbs is here for his 10 o'clock appoint-\nment.  Saunderson is out and so you're elected.\"  Duncan's secre-\ntary  was too damned efficient, he thought.  Why not give  it  to\nsomeone else.  He pushed his intercom button.\n\n\"Gimme a second, I gotta primp.\"  That was Tyrone's code that  he\nneeded  a few minutes to graduate from speculative forensics  and\nreturn  to  Earth  to deal with real life  problems.   As  usual,\nGloria obliged him.  In exactly 3 minutes, his door opened.\n\n\"Mr. Duncan, this is Franklin Dobbs, Chairman and CEO of National\nPulp.  Mr. Dobbs, Mr. Duncan, regional director.\"  She waited for\nthe  two men to acknowledge each other before she shut  the  door\nbehind her.\n\n\"Mr.  Duncan?\"  Dobbs held his hand out to the  huge  FBI  agent.\nDuncan accepted and pointed at a vacant chair.   Dobbs sat obedi-\nently.\n\n\"How can I help you, Mr. Dobbs?\"\n\n\"I am being blackmailed, and I need help.\"  Dobbs looked straight\ninto Duncan's coal black eyes.\n\nThe IRS, thought Duncan.  \"By whom?\" he asked casually.\n\n\"I don't know.\" Dobbs was firm.\n\n\"Then how do you know you are being blackmailed?\"  Duncan  wanted\nto conceal his interest.  Keep it low profile.\n\n\"Let me tell you what happened.\"\n\nGood  start, thought Duncan.  If only half of us would  start  in\nsuch a logical place.\n\n\"Two  days ago I received a package by messenger.   It  contained\nthe  most sensitive information my company has.  Strategic  posi-\ntions,  contingency  plans, competitive information  and  so  on.\nThere are only a half dozen people in my company that have access\nto  that kind of information.  And they all own enough  stock  to\nmake sure that they aren't the culprits.\"\n\n\"So who is?\" interjected Tyrone as he made notes.\n\n\"I don't know.  That's the problem.\"\n\n\"What  did  they ask for?\"  Duncan looked  directly  into  Dobbs'\neyes.  To both force an answer and look for signs of deceit.  All\nhe saw was honesty and real fear.\n\n\"Nothing.  Nothing at all.  All I got was the package and a brief\nmessage.\"\n\n\"What was the message?\" Tyrone asked.\n\n\"We'll be in touch.  That's it.\"\n\n\"So where's the threat?  The blackmail.  This hardly seems like a\ncase for the FBI.\"  Tyrone was baiting the hook.  See if the fish\nis real.\n\n\"None,  not  yet.  But that's not the point.  What they  sent  me\nwere copies, yet they looked more like the originals, of informa-\ntion  that would negatively affect my company.  It's the sort  of\ninformation that we would not want made public. If you know  what\nI mean.\"\n\nTyrone thought,  you bet I know.  You're up to and you want us to\nprotect you.  Fat chance. \"I know what you mean,\" he agreed.\n\n\"I need to stop it. Before it's too late?\"\n\n\"Too late?\" asked Duncan.\n\n\"Too late.  Before it gets out.\"\n\n\"What gets out, Mr. Dobbs?\"  Duncan stared right into and  beyond\nDobbs' eyes.\n\n\"Secrets.   Just  secrets.\"  Dobbs paused to  recompose  himself.\n\"Isn't there a law . . .?\"\n\n\"Yes,  there is Mr. Dobbs.  And if what you say is true, you  are\nentitled to protection.\" Duncan decided to bait Dobbs a bit more.\n\"Even  if  the information is illegal in nature.\"  Wait  for  the\nfish to bite.\n\n\"I grant you I'm no Mother Teresa. I'm a businessman, and I  have\nto make money for my investors.  But in the files that I received\nwere  exact copies of my personal files that no one, and  I  mean\nno one has access to.  They were my own notes, ideas in progress.\nNothing  concrete, just work in progress.  But  someone,  somehow\nhas gotten a hold of it all.  And, by my thinking, there's no way\nto have gotten it without first killing me, and I'm here. So  how\ndid  they  get it?  That's what I need to know.\"   Dobbs  paused.\n\"And then, I need to stop them.\" His soliloquy was over.\n\n\"Who  else is affected?\"  Duncan asked.  The question made  Dobbs\npause too obviously.  The answer was clear.  Dobbs wasn't alone.\n\n\"I  only  speak for myself.  No one else.\"  Dobbs rose  from  the\nchair.  \"It's eminently clear. There's not a damned thing you can\ndo. Good day.\"  Dobbs left the room abruptly leaving Tyrone  with\nplenty of time to think.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 8\n\n     Monday, September 21\n     New York\n\n     14 Dead As Hospital Computer Fails\n     by Scott Mason\n\nFourteen patients died as a result of a massive computer  failure\nthis weekend at the Golda Meier Medical Center on 5th. Avenue.\n\nAccording to hospital officials, the Meditrix Life Support  Moni-\ntors attached to many of the hospital's patients were accidental-\nly disconnected from the nurses stations and the hospital's  main\ncomputer.   Doctors  and nurses were unaware of  any  malfunction\nbecause all systems appeared to operating correctly.\n\nThe LSM's are connected to a hospital wide computer network  that\nconnects  all hospital functions in a central computer.   Medical\nrecords,  insurance filings and treatments as well  as  personnel\nand  operations are coordinated through the  Information  Systems\ndepartment.\n\nGolda Meier Medical Center leads the medical field in the used of\ntechnologically  advanced  techniques, and has been  applying  an\nartificial intelligence based Expert System to assist in  diagno-\nsis and treatment.  Much of the day to day treatment of  patients\nis  done  with  the LSM continually measuring  the  condition  of\npatient,  and  automatically updating his  records.   The  Expert\nSystem  then  determines  what type of  treatment  to  recommend.\nUnless there is a change in the patient's condition that warrants\nthe intervention of a doctor, drugs and medicines are  prescribed\nby the computer.\n\nAccording to computer experts who were called in to  investigate,\nthe Expert System began misprescribing medications and treatments\nearly  Saturday morning.  Doctors estimate that over  50%,  about\n300,   of the hospital's patients received  incorrect  treatment.\nOf those 14 died and another 28 are in critical condition.\n\nUntil  this weekend, the systems were considered foolproof.   The\nentire  computer  system of Golda Meier Medical Center  has  been\ndisconnected until a more intensive investigation is completed.\n\nIn response to the news, the Jewish Defense League is calling the\nincident,  \"an unconscionable attack against  civilized  behavior\nand the Jewish community in particular.\"  They have called for  a\nfull investigation into the episode.\n\nNo group or individuals have yet taken credit for the crime.  The\nAMA has petitioned the Drug and Food Administration to look  into\nthe matter.\n\nGerald  Steinmetz, chief counsel for the Center, said  in  inter-\nviews that he had already been contacted by attorney's represent-\ning the families of the some of the victims of this tragedy.   He\nanticipates extended legal entanglements until such time that the\ntrue  cause can be determined and blame can accurately  assigned.\nThe hospital denies any wrong doing on its or its staff's part.\n\nThis is Scott Mason, determined to stay healthy.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     December, 4 Years Ago\n     Tokyo, Japan\n\nMiles  Foster arrived at Narita Airport as another typhoon  shat-\ntered the coast of Japan.  It was the roughest plane ride he  had\never taken; and after 2 weeks of pure bliss.  Boy, that  Homosoto\nsure knows how to show a guy a good time.\n\nAfter  their first meeting at the OSO World Bank Building,  Miles\nhad  flown  to Tahiti and spent 18 delightful days at  the  outer\nresort  of  Moorea, courtesy of OSO Industries, with all  of  the\ntrimmings. He was provided with a private beach house  containing\nevery modern amenity one could want.  Including two  housekeepers\nand a cook.  Only one of the housekeepers knew how to keep house.\nThe other knew how to keep Miles satisfied.\n\nMarasee was a Pacific Islander who was well schooled in  advanced\nsexual techniques.  At barely 5 feet tall and 96 pounds, her long\nsilken  black  hair was as much as sexual tool as her  hands  and\nmouth.  Her pristine dark complexion and round face caused  Miles\nto  think  that  he was potentially guilty of  crimes  against  a\nminor,  but  after their first night together, he  relented  that\nMarasee knew her business very well.\n\n\"Mr.  Homosoto-San,\" she purred in delicately  accented  English,\n\"wants you to concentrate on your work.\"  She caressed his shoul-\nders  and  upper body as she spoke.  \"He knows that a  man  works\nbest when he has no worries.  It is my job to make sure that  you\nare relaxed.  Completely relaxed. Do you understand?\"\n\nHer  eyes longed for an affirmative answer from Miles.  At  first\nhe  was somewhat baffled.  Homosoto had indeed sent him  on  this\ntrip, vacation, to work, undisturbed.  But Miles thought that  he\nwould  have to fend for himself for his physical pleasures.    He\nwas used to finding ways to satisfy his needs.\n\n\"Homosoto-San  says that you must be relaxed to do  very  serious\nbusiness.  Whenever you need relaxation, I am here.\"\n\nThe  food was as exquisite as was Marasee.  He luxuriated in  the\neternally  perfect  weather,  the beach, the waves  and  he  even\nventured under water on a novice scuba dive.  But, as he knew, he\nwas  here  to concentrate on his assigned task, so  he  tried  to\nlimit his personal activities to sharing pleasure with Marasee.\n\nIn  just a few days, a relaxed Miles felt a peace, a solace  that\nhe  had  never  known before.  He found that his mind  was  at  a\ncreative  high.  His mind propelled through the problems  of  the\nwar  plans,  and  the solutions appeared.  His  brain  seemed  to\nfunction  independent  of effort.  As he established  goals,  the\nroads  to  meet them appeared magically before him,  in  absolute\nclarity.   He was free to explore each one in its entirety,  from\nbeginning to end, undisturbed.\n\nIf  a  problem confounded him, he found  that  merely  forgetting\nabout  it during an interlude with Marasee provided him with  the\nanswer.   The barriers were broken, the so-called 'walls  of  de-\nfense'  crumbled before as he created new methods of  penetration\nno one had ever thought of before.\n\nAs his plan coalesced into a singular whole, he began to  experi-\nence  a euphoria, a high that was neither drug nor  sexually  in-\nduced.  He could envision, all at once, the entire grand  strate-\ngy;  how the myriad pieces effortlessly fit together and  evolved\ninto  a picture perfect puzzle.  Miles became able to  manipulate\nthe  attack scenarios in his mind and make slight changes in  one\nthat  would have far reaching implications in another portion  of\nthe  puzzle.   He might change only one slight  aspect,  yet  see\nsynergistic  ramifications down a side road.  This  new  ability,\ngained  from total freedom to concentrate and his newfound  worry\nfree life, gave Miles new sources of pleasure and inspiration.\n\nAs  his plans came together, Miles yearned for something  outside\nof his idyllic environment.  His strategies grew into a  concrete\nreality,  one which he knew he could execute, if Homosoto  wasn't\nfeeding him a line of shit.  And, for the $100,000 Homosoto  gave\nhim to make plans, he was generally inclined to believe that this\nsuper  rich, slightly eccentric but obviously dangerous  man  was\ndeadly serious.\n\nAs  the days wore on, Miles realized that, more than anything  in\nhis life, even more than getting laid, he wanted to put his  plan\nto  the  test.  If he was right, of which he was sure, in  a  few\nshort years he would be recognized as the most brilliant computer\nscientist in the world.  In the whole damn world.\n\nHis  inner  peace,  the one which fed his  creativity,  soon  was\novertaken  by  the unbridled ego which was Miles  Foster's  inner\nself.   The prospect of success fostered new energies  and  Miles\nworked  even harder to complete the first phase of his task.   To\nthe  occasional  disappointment of Marasee, Miles  would  embroil\nhimself  in  the  computer Homosoto  provided  for  the  purpose.\nMarasee had been with many men, she was an expert, but Miles gave\nher as much pleasure as she to him.  As his work further absorbed\nhim, she rued the day her assignment would be over.\n\nMiles left Tahiti for Tokyo without even saying goodbye to  Mara-\nsee.\n\nThe  ritualistic  scanning and security checks before  Miles  got\nonto  the living room elevator at the OSO Building in Tokyo  evi-\ndenced that Homosoto had not told anyone else how important Miles\nwas.   Even  though he recognized the need for secrecy  in  their\nendeavors, Miles was irked by the patronizing, almost rude treat-\nment he received when he was forced to pass the Sumo scrutiny.\n\nThe  elevator  again opened into the grand white gallery  on  the\n66th floor.\n\n\"Ah  . . .so good to see you again Mr. Foster.   Homosoto-San  is\nanxious to see you.\"  A short Japanese manservant escorted  Miles\nto the doors of Homosoto's office.  The briefest of taps  invited\nthe bellow of \"Hai!\" from its inner sanctum.\n\nHomosoto  was  quick to rise from his  techo-throne  and  greeted\nMiles as if they were long lost friends.\n\n\"Mr.  Foster . . .it is so good to see you.  I assume  everything\nwas  satisfactory?   You  found the working  conditions  to  your\nliking?\"   Homosoto awkwardly searched for the  vain  compliment.\nHe  pointed at the leather seating area in which they  had  first\ndiscussed their plans.   They sat in the same chairs they had the\nlast time they met.\n\nMiles was taken aback by the warm reception, but since he was  so\nimportant  to  Homosoto, it was only fitting to be  treated  with\nrespect.\n\nMiles returned the courtesy with the minimum required bow of  the\nhead.  It was a profitable game worth playing. \"Very much so, Mr.\nHomosoto.  It was most relaxing . . .and I think you will be very\npleased with the results.\"   Miles smiled warmly, expecting to be\nheavily  complimented on his promise.  Instead, Homosoto  ignored\nthe business issue.\n\n\"I  understand  that Miss Marasee was most pleased . .  .was  she\nnot?\"  The implication was clear.  For the first time, Miles  saw\na glimmer of a dirty old man looking for the sordid details.\n\n\"I  guess so.  I was too busy working to pay  attention.\"   Miles\ntried to sluff off the comment.\n\n\"That  is what she says.  That you were too busy for her . .  .or\nto  say goodbye and thank her for her attentions.  Not an  auspi-\ncious beginning Mr. Foster.\"  Miles caught the derision in  Homo-\nsoto's voice and didn't appreciate it one little bit.\n\n\"Listen.   My  affairs  are my affairs.  I am  grateful  for  the\nservices, but I do like to keep my personal life just that.  Per-\nsonal.\"   Miles was polite, but firm.  Homosoto nodded in  under-\nstanding.\n\n\"Of  course, Mr. Foster, I understand completely.  It  is  merely\nfor  the sake of the young woman that I mention it. There  is  no\noffense   intended.   It  is  shall  we  say  .  .  .a   cultural\ndifference?\"\n\nMiles  didn't  believe  in the cultural difference  to  which  he\nreferred,  but he didn't press the point.  He merely nodded  that\nthe subject was closed.   A pregnant pause followed before  Homo-\nsoto interrupted the silence.\n\n\"So, Mr. Foster.  I really did not expect to see you for  another\nfew  weeks.   I must assume that you have made some  progress  in\nplanning  our  future  endeavors.\"  Homosoto wore  a  smile  that\nbelied little of his true thoughts.\n\n\"You  bet  your  ass, I did.\"  Homosoto winced  at  the  colorful\nlanguage.  It was Miles' way of maintaining some control over the\nsituation.   His  dimples  recessed even further  as  he  enjoyed\nwatching Homosoto's reaction.   \"It turned out to be simpler than\neven I had thought.\"\n\n\"Would you be so kind as to elaborate?\"\n\n\"Gotcha.\"  Miles opened his briefcase and brought out a sheath of\npapers  with charts and scribbles all over them.  \"Basically  the\ntechnology is pretty simple.  Here are the fundamental systems to\nuse  in  the attack, there are only four  of them.    After  all,\nthere are no defenses, so that's not a problem.\"\n\n\"Problem?\" Homosoto raised his eyes.\n\n\"Ok,  not  problem.  As you can see here, putting  the  technical\npieces together is not the issue.  The real issue is creating  an\neffective  deployment of the tools we create.\"  Miles was  matter\nof fact and for the first time Homosoto saw Miles as the  itiner-\nant professional he was capable of being.  The challenge. Just as\nMiles promised earlier, 'give me a challenge, the new, the undone\nand  I  will be the best.'  Miles was shining in his  own  excel-\nlence,  and his ego was gone, totally gone.  His  expertise  took\nover.\n\n\"I  have  labeled various groups that we will need to  pull  this\noff.\"\n\n\"Pull off? Excuse me . . .\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry.  Make it work? Have it happen?\"\n\n\"Ah yes,  So sorry.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"  Miles looked at Homosoto carefully.  Was  there  a\nmutual respect actually developing?\n\n\"As  I said, we will have to have several groups who  don't  even\nknow  about each other's existence.  At NSA we call  it  contain-\nment, or need to know.\"\n\nHomosoto  cursorily examined the printouts on the table in  front\nof  him,  but preferred to address Miles' comments.   \"Could  you\nexplain,  please?   I don't see how one can build a  car  if  you\ndon't  know what it's going to look like when you're  done.   You\nsuggest that each person or group functions without the knowledge\nof the others?  How can this be efficient?\"\n\nMiles smiled.  For the first time he felt a bit of compassion for\nHomosoto, as one would feel for the naive child asking why 1 plus\n1  equals  2.   Homosoto was used to  the  Japanese  work  ethic:\nHere's  a  beautiful picture of a car, and all 50,000 of  us  are\ngoing  to build it; you 5,000 build the engines, you 5,000  build\nthe  body and so on.  After a couple of years we'll have built  a\nfabulous automobile that we have all shared as a common vision.\n\nHomosoto had no idea of how to wage a war, although he apparently\nafford it. Miles realized he could be in control after all, if he\nonly sold Homosoto on his abilities, and he was well on the way.\n\n\"You see, Mr. Homosoto, what we are trying to do requires that no\none,  except a few key people like you and I, understand what  is\ngoing  on.  As we said  in World War II, loose lips sink  ships.\"\nHomosoto  immediately bristled at the mention of the war.   Miles\nhardly noticed as he continued.  \"The point is, as I have it laid\nout  here,  only  a handful of people need to know  what  we  are\ntrying  to achieve.  All of the rest have clearly defined  duties\nthat  they are expected to perform as we ask.   Each  effectively\nworks  in  a  vacuum.  Efficient, not exactly.   Secure,  yes.  I\nimagine you would like to keep this operation as secret as possi-\nble.\"\n\nHomosoto took immediate notice and bolted his response. \"Hai!  Of\ncourse,  secrecy is important, but how can we be sure of  compli-\nance by our . . .associates?\"\n\n\"Let me continue.\" Miles referred back to the papers in front  of\nhim.  \"The first group is called the readers, the second will  be\ndedicated  to research and development.\" Homosoto smiled  at  the\nR&D  reference. He could understand that.  \"Then there will be  a\npublic relations group, a communications group, a software compa-\nny  will  be needed, another group I call the  Mosquitoes  and  a\nlittle  manufacturing  which  I assume you  can  handle.\"   Miles\nlooked for Homosoto's reaction.\n\n\"Manufacturing, very easy.  I don't fully understand the  others,\nbut  I am most impressed with your outline.  You mentioned  prob-\nlem.  Can you explain?\"  Homosoto had become a different  person.\nOne  who showed adolescent enthusiasm.  He moved to the  edge  of\nhis seat.\n\n\"As  with  any  well designed plan,\" Miles  boasted,  \"there  are\ncertain  situations that need to be addressed.  In this  case,  I\nsee several.\"  Miles was trying to hook Homosoto onto the prover-\nbial deck.\n\n\"I asked for problem.\"  Homosoto insisted.\n\n\"To  properly effect this plan we will need two things  that  may\nmake it impossible.\"\n\nHomosoto met the challenge. \"What do you need?\"\n\nMiles  liked  the sound of it.  You. What do _you_  need.   \"This\noperation could cost as much as $50 million.  Is that a problem?\"\n\nHomosoto  looked  squarely at Miles.  \"No problem.  What  is  the\nsecond thing you need?\"\n\n\"We  will  need  an army.  Not an army with guns, but  a  lot  of\npeople  who will follow orders.  That may be more important  than\nthe money.\"\n\nHomosoto  took a momentary repose while he thought.  \"How big  an\narmy will you need?\"\n\n\"My guess?  Today?  I would say that for all groups we will  need\na minimum of 500 people.  Maybe as many as a thousand.\"\n\nHomosoto  suddenly  laughed out loud.  \"You call  that  an  army?\n1000  men?  An army?  That is a picnic my friend.\"  Homosoto  was\nenjoying his own personal joke.  \"When you said army, Mr.  Foster\nI  imagined  tens of thousands of people running all  around  the\nUnited States shooting their guns. A thousand people?  I can give\nyou  a  thousand dedicated people with a single phone  call.   Is\nthat all you need?\"  He continued his laughter.\n\nMiles was taken aback and had difficulty hiding his surprise.  He\nhad  already padded his needs by a factor of three.  \"With a  few\nminor specialties and exceptions, yes.  That's it.  If we  follow\nthis blue print.\"  He pointed at the papers spread before them.\n\nHomosoto  sat  back and closed his eyes in  apparent  meditation.\nMiles watched and waited for several minutes.  He looked out  the\nexpanse  of  windows over Tokyo patiently as Homosoto  seemed  to\nsleep in the chair across from him.  Homosoto spoke quietly  with\nhis eyes still closed.\n\n\"Mr. Foster?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"  Miles was ready.\n\n\"Do you love you country?\"  Homosoto's eyelids were still.\n\nMiles had not expected such a question.\n\n\"Mr. Foster?  Did you hear the question?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\" He paused. \"I'm thinking.\"\n\n\"If  you  need to think, sir, then the answer is clear.   As  you\nhave told me, you hold no allegiance.  Your country means nothing\nto you.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't quite put it that way . . .\" Miles said  defensively.\nHe couldn't let this opportunity escape.\n\n\"You  hold your personal comfort as your primary concern, do  you\nnot?   You want the luxuries that the United States  offers,  but\nyou  don't care where or how you get them? Is that not  so?   You\nwant your women, your wine, your freedom, but you will take it at\nany  expense.  I do not think I exaggerate.  Tell me Mr.  Foster,\nif I am wrong.\"\n\nMiles  realized  he was being asked to state his  personal  alle-\ngiances in mere seconds.  Not since he was in the lower floors of\nthe NSA being interrogated had he been asked to state his convic-\ntions.  He knew the right answer there, but here, he wasn't quite\nsure.   The wrong answer could blow it.  But, then again, he  was\n$110,000 ahead of the game for a few weeks work.\n\n\"I  need to ask you a question to answer yours.\"  Miles  did  not\nwant to be backed into a corner.  \"Mr. Homosoto.  Do you want  me\nto have allegiance to my country or to you?\"\n\nHomosoto was pleased. \"You debate well, young man.  It  is not so\nmuch that I care if you love America. I want, I need to know what\nyou  do love.  You see, for me, I love Japan and my family.   But\nmuch  of my family was taken from me in one terrible  instant,  a\nlong  time ago.  They are gone, but now I have my wife, my  chil-\ndren  and  their children.  I learned, that if there  is  nothing\nelse,  you must have family.  That must come  first, Mr.  Foster.\nUnder all conditions,  family is first.  All else is last.  So my\nallegiance  shifted, away from country, to my family and  my  be-\nliefs.   I don't always agree with my government, and  there  are\ntimes I will defy their will. I can assure you, that if we embark\nupon  this route, neither I nor you will endear ourselves to  our\nrespective governments.  Does that matter to you?\"\n\nMiles  snickered.  \"Matter?  After what they did to me?   Let  me\ntell you something.  I gave my country most of my adult life.   I\ncould have gone to work with my family . . .my associates . . .\"\n\n\"I am aware of your background Mr. Foster,\" Homosoto interrupted.\n\n\"I'm  sure you are.  But that's neither here nor there.  I  could\nhave been on easy street.  Plug a few numbers and make some bucks\nfor  the clan.\"  The colloquialism escaped Homosoto, but  he  got\nthe  gist  of  it.  \"But I said to  myself,  'hey,  you're  good.\nFixing  roulette wheels is beneath you.'  I needed, I still  need\nthe  diversion, the challenge, so I figured that the  Feds  would\ngive  me the edge I needed to make something of  myself.\"   Miles\nwas turning red around his neck.\n\n\"The  NSA had the gear, the toys  for me to play with,  and  they\npromised  me the world.  Create, they said, lead America's  tech-\nnology  into the 21st. century.  What a pile of shit. Working  at\nthe  NSA is like running for President.  You're always trying  to\nsell yourself, your ideas.  They don't give a shit about how good\nyour  ideas  are.  All they care is that you're  asshole  buddies\nwith the powers that be. To get something done there, you need  a\nhalf  dozen  committees  with their asses greased  from  here  to\neternity  for  them  to say maybe.  Do you  know  the  difference\nbetween ass kissing and having your head up your ass?\"\n\n\"If  I  understand your crudities, I assume this is  an  American\njoke, then, no Mr. Foster, I do not know the difference.\"\n\n\"Depth perception.\"  Miles looked for a reaction to his  anatomi-\ncal doublette.  There was none other than Homosoto's benign smile\nindicating no comprehension.  \"OK, never mind, I'll save it.   At\nany rate, enough was enough.  I gotta do something with my life.\"\nMiles had said his piece.\n\n\"In other words, money is your motivation?\"\n\n\"Money  doesn't  hurt, sure.  But, I need to do what  I  believe.\nNot that that means hurting my country, but if they don't  listen\nto  what makes sense, maybe it's best that they meet their  worst\nenemy to get them off of their keesters.\"  Miles was on a roll.\n\n\"Keesters?\"  Homosoto's naivete was amusing.\n\n\"Oops!\" Miles exclaimed comically.  \"Butts, asses, fannies?\"   He\npatted his own which finally communicated the intention.\n\n\"Ah  yes.\"  Homosoto agreed.  \"So you feel you could  best  serve\nyour country by attacking it?\"\n\nMiles  only thought for a few seconds. \"I guess you could put  it\nthat way.  Sure.\"\n\n\"Mr.  Foster, or should I say General Foster?\"  Miles  beamed  at\nthe reference.  \"We shall march to success.\"\n\n\"Mr. Homosoto,\" Miles broke the pagential silence.  \"I would like\nto ask you the same question.  Why?\"\n\n\"I was wondering when you were going to ask me that Mr.  Foster,\"\nHomosoto  said with his grin intact.  \"Because, Mr. Foster, I  am\nreturning the favor.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                    Chapter 9\n\n     September, 1982\n     South East Iraq\n\nAhmed  Shah lay in a pool of his own blood along with  pieces  of\nwhat was once another human being.\n\nThe pain was intolerable.  His mind exploded as the nerve endings\nfrom  the remains of his arms and legs shot liquid fire into  his\ncerebral  cortex.   His  mind screamed in sheer  agony  while  he\nstruggled  to stay conscious.  He wasn't sure why, but he had  to\nstay   awake    .  .  .can't  pass  out  .  .   .sleep,   blessed\nsleep  .  .  .release me from the pain . .  .Allah!  Oh  take  me\nAllah  .  .  .I  shall  be  a  martyr  fighting  for  your   holy\ncause . . .in your name . . . for the love of Islam . . .for  the\nAyatollah . . .take me into your arms and let me live for   eter-\nnity in your shadow . . .\n\nThe  battle for Abadan, a disputed piece of territory that was  a\nhub for Persian Gulf oil distribution had lasted days.  Both Iran\nand  Iraq threw waves of human fodder at each other in  what  was\nreferred  to  in the world press as \" . . .auto-genocide .  .  .\"\nNeither  side  reacted  to the monumental  casualties  that  they\nsustained.   The lines of reinforcements were steady.   The  dead\nbodies  were thick on the battlefield; there was no time to  col-\nlect  them  and provide a proper burial. New troops had  as  much\ndifficulty  wading  through the obstacle courses  made  of  human\ncorpses as staying alive.\n\nPublic  estimates  were  that  the  war  had  already  cost  over\n1,000,000 lives  for the adversaries.  Both governments  disputed\nthe figures.  The two agreed only 250,000 had died.  The  extrem-\nist  leaders of both countries believed that the  lower  casualty\nnumbers  would mollify world opinion.  It accomplished the  exact\nopposite.   Criticism  was rampant, in the world courts  and  the\npress.   Children were going to battle.  Or  more  appropriately,\nchildren were marching in the front lines, often without  weapons\nor  shoes, and used as cover for the advancing armed  infantrymen\nbehind  them.  The children were disposable receptacles for enemy\nbullets.  The supreme sacrifice would permit the dead pre-adoles-\ncents the honor of martyrdom and an eternal place with Allah.\n\nMothers  wailed and beat their breasts in the streets of  Teheran\nas word arrived of loved ones and friends who died in Allah's war\nagainst the Iraqi infidels.  Many were professional mourners  who\nwere  hired  by others to represent families to  make  them  look\nbigger and more  Holy. Expert wailing and flagellation came at  a\nprice.   The  bulk of the civilized world, even  Brezhnev's  evil\nSoviet  empire denounced the use of unarmed children  for  cannon\nfodder.\n\nThe war between Iran and Iraq was to continue, despite pleas from\nhumanity, for another 6 years.\n\nAhmed  Shah was a 19  year old engineering student at the  exclu-\nsive Teheran University when the War started.  He was reared as a\ndedicated  Muslim  by wealthy parents.  Somehow his  parents  had\nescaped the Ayatollah's scourge after the fall of the Shah. Ahmed\nwas never told the real reason, but a distribution of holy  rials\ncertainly  helped.  They were permitted to keep  their  beautiful\nhome  in the suburbs of Teheran and Ahmed's father kept his  pro-\nfessorship at Teheran University.  Ahmed was taught by his family\nthat the Shah's downfall was the only acceptable response to  the\nloss of faith under his regime.\n\n\"The  Shah  is a puppet  of the Americans.   Ptooh!\"  His  father\nwould  spit.  \"The Yanqis come over  here, tell us to change  our\nculture and our beliefs so we can make them money from our  oil!\"\nFor a professor he was outspoken, but viewed as mainstream by the\nextremist  camps.  Ahmed learned well.  For the most part of  his\nlife  all Ahmed knew was the Ayatollah Khomeini as his  country's\nspiritual  leader. News and opinion from the West  was  virtually\nnonexistent  so Ahmed developed as a devout Muslim, dedicated  to\nhis country and his religion.\n\nWhen  the War began he thought about enlisting  immediately,  but\nthe University counselors convinced him otherwise.\n\n\"Ahmed Shah, you are bright and can offer Iran great gifts  after\nyou  complete  your studies.  Why not wait, the War will  not  be\nforever,  and then you can serve Allah with your mind,  not  your\nbody.\"\n\nAhmed  took  the advice for his first year at  the  a  university\nstudent,  but  guilt overwhelmed him when he learned  about   how\nmany  other young people were dying in the cause.  From his  par-\nents  he  would hear of childhood friends who  had  been  killed.\nTeheran  University students and graduates were honored daily  in\nthe  Mosque  on campus.  The names were  copied  and  distributed\nthroughout the schools.  True martyrs.  Ahmed's guilt  compounded\nas  the months passed and so many died.  He had been too young to\nparticipate in the occupation of the American Embassy. How  jeal-\nous he was.\n\nWhy  should  I wait to serve Allah? He mused.  Today I can be  of\nservice,  where he needs me, but if I stay and study, I will  not\nbe able to bid his Will for years.  And what if Iraq wins?  There\nwould be no more studies anyway.  Ahmed anguished for weeks  over\nhow he could best serve  Iran, his Ayatollah and Allah.\n\nAfter  his freshman finals, on which he excelled, he  joined  the\nIrani  Army. Within 60 days he was sent to the front lines  as  a\ncommunications officer.\n\nThey had been in the field 3 days, and  Ahmed had only gotten  to\nknow a few of the 60 men in his company when the mortars came  in\nright  on top of them.  The open desert offers little  camouflage\nso  the  soldiers built fox holes behind the larger  sand  dunes.\nThey innaccurately thought they were hidden from view. More  than\nhalf  the company died instantly.  Pieces of bodies  were  strewn\nacross the sandy tented bivouac.\n\nAnother  20 were dying within 50 yards of where Ahmed writhed  in\nagony. Ahmed regained consciousness. Was it 5 minutes or 5  hours\nlater.   He had no way of knowing.  The left lower arm  where  he\nwore his wristwatch was gone.  A pulpy stump.  As were his  legs.\nMutilated  . . .the highest form  of insult and degradation.  Oh,\nAllah, I have served you, let me die and come to you now.  Let me\nsuffer no more.\n\nSuddenly his attention was grabbed by the sound of a jeep  cough-\ning its way to a stop.  He heard voices.\n\n\"This  one's  still alive.\"  Then a shot rang  out.   \"So's  this\none.\"  Another shot.  A few muted voices from the dying protested\nand  asked for mercy. \"Ha! I give Mercy to a dog before you.\"   A\nscream  and 2 shots.  They were Iraqi!  Killing off the  wounded.\nPigs!  Infidels!  Mother Whores!\n\n\"You,  foreskin  of a camel! Your mother lies with  dogs!\"  Ahmed\nscreamed  at the soldiers. It brought two results.  One, it  kept\nhim  a little more alert and less aware of his pain, and two,  it\nattracted the attention of the two soldiers from the jeep.\n\n\"Ola!  Who insults the memory of my mother  who sits with  Allah?\nWho?\"  One soldier spun around and tried to imagine which one  of\nthe pieces of bodies that surrounded him still had enough life to\nspeak.   He  scanned the sand nearby. Open eyes were not  a  sure\nsign of life nor was the presence of four limbs.  There needed to\nbe a head.\n\n\"Over  here camel dung.  Hussein fucks animals who give birth  to\nthe  likes   of  you.\"  Ahmed's viciousness was the  only  facial\nfeature  that  gave away he was alive.  The  soldiers  saw  their\ntormentor.\n\n\"Prepare to meet with your Allah, now,\" as  one soldier took  aim\nat Ahmed's head.\n\n\"Go ahead!  Shoot, pig shit.  I welcome death so I won't have  to\nsee your filth . . .\"  Ahmed defied the soldier and the automatic\nrifle aimed at him.\n\nThe  other soldier intervened. \"No, don't kill him.  That's   too\neasy and we would be honoring his last earthly request. No,  this\none doesn't beg for mercy.  At least he's a man. Let's just  make\nhim  suffer.\"  The second soldier raised his gun and  pointed  at\nthe  junction  of Ahmed's two stumps for legs.  Two  point  blank\nrange  shots  shattered  the three components  of  his  genitals.\nAhmed  let out a scream so primal, so anguished,  so  penetrating\nthat  the  soldiers  bolted to escape the sounds  of  death.  The\nscream  continued,  briefly interrupted by a pair of  shots  that\ncaught the two soldiers square in the middle of the back as  they\nran.  They dropped onto the hot desert  sand with matched thuds.\n\nAhmed  didn't  hear  the shots over the sounds  coming  from  his\nlarynx. He didn't hear anything after that for a very long time.\n\nUnfortunately for Ahmed Shah, he survived.\n\nHe woke up, or more accurately, regained semi-consciousness  more\nthan  a  week after he was picked up at the site  of  the  mortar\nattack.   He was wired  up to tubes and machines in an  obviously\nwell  equipped  hospital.  He thought, I must be back  in  Teher-\nan  .  .  .then  fog  .  . .a  blur .  .  .a  needle  .  .  .feel\nnothing . . .stay awake . . .move lips . . .talk . . .\n\n\"Doctor, the patient was awake.\" The nurse spoke to the physician\nwho was writing on Ahmed's medical chart.\n\n\"He'll  wish he wasn't.  Let him go.  Let him sleep. Hell  hasn't\nbegun for him yet.\"  The Doctor moved onto the chart on the  next\nbed in ward.\n\nOver the next few days while grasping at consciousness, and  with\nthe  caring  attention of the nurses, Ahmed pieced  together  the\nstrands of a story . . .what happened to him.\n\nThe Iraqis were killing the wounded, desperate in their  attempts\nto  survive the onslaught of Irani children.  All must die,  take\nno  prisoners were their marching orders. In the Iraqi  Army  you\neither did exactly as you were told,  with absolute obedience, or\nyou  were shot on sight as a traitor.  Some choice.  We  lost  at\nAbadan,  the Iraqi's thought, but there will be more  battles  to\nwin.\n\nAhmed  was the only survivor from his company, and there  was  no\nearthly reason that could explain why he lived. He was more  dead\nthan  alive.   His blood coagulated well in the hot  desert  sun,\notherwise the blood loss alone would have killed him.  The medics\nfound  many  of his missing pieces and packed them up  for  their\ntrip  to the hospital, but the doctors were unable  to  re-attach\nanything of significance.\n\nHe was a eunuch.  With no legs and only one good arm.\n\nWeeks  of  wishing himself dead proved to be the source  of  rest\nthat contributed to his recovery.  Was he man? Was he woman?  Was\nhe, God forbid, neither?  Why had he not just died along with the\nothers,  why  was  he spared! Spared, ha!  If I  had  truly  been\nspared  I would be living with Allah!  This is not being  spared.\nThis  is living hell and someone will pay. He cried to his   par-\nents about his torment and his mother wailed and beat her breast.\nHis  father  listened  to the anger, the  hate  and  the  growing\nstrength  within his son's being.  Hate could be the answer  that\nwould  make his son, his only son, whole again.  Whole in  spirit\nat least.\n\nThe debates within Ahmed's mind developed into long philosophical\narguments  about right, wrong, revenge, avenge,   purpose,  cause\nand  reason. He would take both sides of an issue, and see if  he\ncould beat himself with his alter rationales. The frustration  at\nknowing one's opponents' thoughts when developing your own  coun-\nter  argument  made him angry, too.  He finally  started  arguing\nwith  other patients.  He would take any position, on  any  issue\nand  debate  all night. Argumentative, contrary,  but  recovering\ncompletely described the patient.\n\nOver the months his strength returned and he appeared to come  to\ngrips with his infirmaries.  As much as anyone can come to  terms\nwith  such  physical mutilations.  He covered his  facial  wounds\nwith  a full black beard that melded into his full short  cropped\nkinky hair.\n\nAhmed  graduated  from Teheran University in 1984  with  a  cruel\nhatred  for anything Anti-Islam.  One major target of his  hatred\nwas President Reagan, the cowboy president, the Teflon president,\nthe  evil  Anti-Muslim  Zionist loving  American  president.   Of\ncourse there was plenty of room to hate others, but Reagan was so\neasy  to hate, so easy to blame, and rarely was there  any  disa-\ngreement.\n\nHe  thought  of grand strategies to strike back at  the  America.\nAfter  all, didn't they support the Iraqis?  And the  Iraqis  did\nthis  to  him.  It wasn't  the soldiers' fault.  They  were  just\nfollowing orders: Do or Die.  Any rational person would have done\nthe  same thing.  He understood that.  So he blamed  Reagan,  not\nHussein. And he blamed the American people  for their  stupidity,\ntheir isolationism, their indifference to the rest of the  world.\nThey  are  all so smug and caught up in their  own  little  petty\nlives, and there are causes, people are dying for causes, and the\nAmerican  fools  don't even care.   And Reagan  personified  them\nall.\n\nHow does a lousy movie actor from the 1950's get to be  President\nof  the United States?  Ahmed laughed to himself at  the  obvious\nanswer. He was the most qualified for  the job.\n\nHis commentaries and orations about the Imperialists, the  United\nStates,  England,  even the Soviet Union and  their  overwhelming\ninfluence in the Arab world made Ahmed Shah a popular man on  the\ncampus  of  Teheran University. His  highly  visible  infirmities\nassisted with his credibility.\n\nIn his sixth semester of study, Ahmed's counselor called him  for\na conference.  Beside his counselor was another man, Beni  Farja-\nni,  from the government. Beni was garbed in Arab robes and  tur-\nbans that always look filthy.  Still, he was the officious  type,\nformal and somber.  His long white hair snuck through the turban,\nand his face shoed ample wrinkles of wisdom.\n\nHe and  the Counselor sat alone, on one side  of a large   wooden\nconference  table  that  could easily  have  seated  20.    Ahmed\nstopped  his motorized wheel chair at the table,  Farjani  spoke,\nand curiously, the Counselor rose from his chair and slipped  out\nof the room.  Ahmed and the Government official were alone.\n\n\"My  name is Beni Farjani, Associate Director to the  Undersecre-\ntary of  Communications and Propaganda.  I trust you are well.\"\n\nAhmed  long  since gave up commenting on his well being  or  lack\nthereof.  \"It is good to meet you,  sir.\"  He waited for more.\n\n\"Ahmed  Shah,  you are important to the state and the  people  of\nIran.\"  Farjani said it as though his comment was already  common\nknowledge.   \"What I am here to ask you, Ahmed Shah, is, are  you\nwilling again to serve Allah?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course . . .?\"  He bowed his head in reverence.\n\n\"Good,  because  we think that you might be able to assist  on  a\nsmall  project we have been contemplating.  My son, you have  the\ngift  of  oration, speaking, moving crowds to  purpose.   I  only\nwish I had it!\"  Beni Farjani smiled solemnly at Ahmed.\n\n\"I  thank Allah for His gift.  I am only  the humble conduit  for\nhis Will.\"\n\n\"I  understand, but you have now, and will have much to proud of.\nI believe you graduate in 6 months.  Is that correct?\"\n\n\"Yes, and then I go to Graduate School . . .\"\n\n\"I am afraid that won't be possible Ahmed Shah.\" Farjani shook  a\nkindly  wrinkled finger at him.  \"As soon as you  graduate,  your\nGovernment,  at Allah's bidding, would like you to move   to  the\nUnited States.\"\n\n\"America?\"  Ahmed gaped in surprise.\n\n\"We fear that America may invade Iran, that we may go to war with\nthe  United  States.\"    The words stunned Ahmed.   Could  he  be\nserious?   Sure,  relations  were in pretty bad  shape,  but  was\nFarjani  saying  that Iran was truly preparing for  War?   Jihad?\nHoly War against the United States?\n\n\"We  need to protect ourselves,\" Farjani spoke calmly,  with  au-\nthority. \"America has weapons of mass destruction that can  reach\nour  land in minutes, while we have nothing to offer in  retalia-\ntion.   Nothing, and that is a very frightening reality that  the\npeople  of Iran must live with every day. A truly helpless  feel-\ning.\"   Ahmed was listening carefully, and so far what  he  heard\nwas making a great deal of sense.\n\n\"Both  the Soviets and the Americans can destroy each  other  and\nthe  rest  of the world with a button.  Their armies  will  never\nmeet.   A  few missiles and it's all  over.  A  30  minute  grand\nfinale to civilization.  They don't have to, nor  would we expect\neither  the Soviets or the Americans to ask the rest of the world\nif they mind. They just go ahead and pull the trigger and  every-\none else be damned.\n\n\"And  yes, there have been better times when our nation  has  had\nmore friends, when all Arabs thought and acted as one; especially\nagainst the Americans.  They have the most to gain and  the  most\nto lose from invading and crossing our borders.  They would  love\nnothing  more than to steal our land, our oil and even take  over\nOPEC.  All in the name of world stability.  They'll throw  around\nNational Security smoke screens and do what they want.\"   Farjani\nwas speaking quite excitedly.\n\nAhmed  was fascinated.  A man from the Government who was  nearly\nas  vitriolic as he was about America.  The only  difference  was\nAhmed wanted to attack, and  Farjani wanted to defend.  He didn't\nthink it opportune to interrupt.  Farjani continued.\n\n\"The  Russians  want us as a warm water port.  They  have  enough\noil,  gas  and resources, but they crave a port that  isn't  con-\ntrolled by the Americans such as in the Black Sea and through the\nHellespont.  So they too, are a potential enemy.  You  see  don't\nyou,  Ahmed, that Allah has so graced our country  everyone  else\nwants to take it away from us?\"  Ahmed nodded automatically.\n\n\"So  we need to create a defense against  outside aggressors.  We\ndo not  have weapons that can reach American shores, that is  so.\nBut we have something that the Americans will never have, because\nthey will never understand.  Do you know what that is?\"\n\nBefore Ahmed could answer, Farjani continued.\n\n\"Honor  and Faith to protect our heritage, our  systems, our  way\nof life.\"   Ahmed agreed.\n\n\"We want you, Ahmed Shah to build a network  of supporters,  just\nlike  you,  all across the United States that will  come  to  our\nservice  when  we  need them.  To the death.   Your  skills  will\ncapture the attention of those with kindred sentiments.  You will\ndraw them out, from the schools, from the universities.\n\n\"Ahmed  Shah, there are over 100,000 Irani and Arab  students  in\nthe  United States today.  Many, many of them are sympathetic  to\nour  causes.  Many of  them are attending American  Universities,\nside  by side  with their future enemies, learning  the  American\nway  so we may better fight it.  You will become one of them  and\nyou  will find others that can be trusted, counted  on,  depended\nupon when we call.\n\n\"Your obvious dedication and personal tragedies,\" Farjani pointed\nat  the obvious affliction, \"will be the glue to  provide  others\nwith  strength.  You will have no problems in  recruiting.   That\nwill be the easy part.\"\n\n\"If recruiting is so easy, then what will be the hard task?\"\n\n\"Holding  them back. You will find it most difficult to  restrain\nyour  private  army from striking.  Right  under  the  American's\nnoses,  you  will have to keep them from bursting  at  the  seams\nuntil the day comes when they are needed.  If could be weeks,  it\ncould  be years.  We don't know.  Maybe the day will never  come.\nBut  it   is your job to build this Army.  Grow it, feed  it  and\nkeep  our national spirit alive until such time that  it  becomes\nnecessary  to defend our nation, Allah and loyal  Muslims  every-\nwhere.   This  time, though, we will fight America  from  within,\ninside her borders.\n\n\"There  hasn't  been a foreign war on American soil  since  1812.\nAmericans  don't know what is like to have their country  ruined,\nravaged,  blown up before their eyes.  We need a defense  against\nAmerica,  and  when it is deeded by Allah, our army  will  strike\nback  at  America where is hurts most.  In the streets  of  their\ncities.   In  their homes, parks and schools. But first  we  must\nhave that army. In place, and willing to act.\n\n\"You  will find out all the details in good time, I  assure  you.\nYou  will  require  some training, though, and  that  will  begin\nshortly.  Everything you need to serve will be given you. Go with\nAllah.\n\nAhmed  trained  for several months with  the  infamous  terrorist\ngroup Abu Nidal.  He learned the basics that every modern terror-\nist needs to know to insure success against the Infidels.\n\nShah moved to New York City on December 25, 1986.  Christmas  was\na non issue.  He registered at Columbia as a graduate  researcher\nin the engineering department to legitimize his student visa  and\nwould commence classes on January 2.\n\nRecruitment was easy, just as  Farjani had said.\n\nAhmed built a team of 12 recruiters whom he could trust with  his\nlife.   Seven  professional terrorists, unknown to  the  American\nauthorities,  thoroughly sanitized,  came with him to the  United\nStates  under  assumed   visas and the other 5,  already  in  the\ncountry were personally recommended by Farjani.\n\nHis  disciples were located in strategic locations; New York  was\nhost  to Ahmed and another Arab fanatic trained in  Libya.   They\nboth  used Columbia University as their cover.   Washington  D.C.\nwas honored with a Syrian terrorist who had organized mass  anti-\nUS demonstrations in Damascus as the request of President  Assad.\nLos  Angeles and San Francisco were homes to 4  more  engineering\ntype  desert terrorist school graduates who were allowed to  move\nfreely and interact with the shakers and movers in high technolo-\ngy disciplines.  Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and Dallas were\nalso used as recruitment centers for developing Ahmed's  personal\narmy.\n\nIf the media had been aware of the group's activities they  would\nhave made note that Ahmed's inner circle were very highly skilled\nnot only in the use of C4 and Cemex, the Czechoslovakian  plastic\nexplosive  that was responsible for countless deaths of  innocent\nbystanders,  but  that were all very well educated.   Each  spoke\nEnglish like a native, fluent in colloquialisms and idioms unique\nto America.\n\nMuch  of his army had skills which enabled them to acquire  posi-\ntions  of importance within engineering departments of  companies\nsuch  as  IBM, Apple, Hughes Defense Systems,   Chase  Manhattan,\nPrudential  Life, Martin Marietta, Westinghouse, Compuserve,  MCI\nand  hundreds of similar organizations.  Every one of  their  em-\nployers would have attested to their skills, honor and loyalty to\ntheir  adapted country.  Ahmed's group was well versed in  decep-\ntion.  After all, they answered to a greater cause.\n\nWhat even a seasoned reporter might not find out though, was that\nall  12  of Ahmed's elite recruiters had to pass a  supreme  test\noften  required  by international political  terrorist  organiza-\ntions.   To guarantee their loyalty to the cause,  whatever  that\ncause might be, and to weed out potential external  infiltrators,\neach  member  had  to have killed at least one  member  of  their\nimmediate family.\n\nIt  requires extraordinary hardening, to say the least,  to  kill\nyour mother or father.  Or to blow up the school bus that carried\nyour pre-teen sister to school.  Or engage your brother in a mock\nfight  and then sever his head from his body.  The savagery  that\npermitted one access into this elite circle is beyond the compre-\nhension  of  most Western minds. Yet such acts were  expected  to\ndemonstrate one's loyalty to a supreme purpose or belief.\n\nThe events surrounding Solman Rushdie and the Satanic Verses were\na  case in point.  Each of those who volunteered  to  assassinate\nhim at the bequest of the Ayatollah Khomeini had in fact  already\nkilled  not  only innocent women and children in order  to  reach\ntheir  assigned  terrorist targets, but had brought the  head  of\ntheir family victim to the table of their superiors.  A deed  for\nwhich they were honored and revered.\n\nThese  were the men, all of them men, who pledged  allegiance  to\nAhmed  Shah and the unknown, undefined assignments they would  in\nthe future be asked to complete.  To the death if necessary,  and\nwithout fear.   These men were reminiscent of the infamous  moles\nthat  Stalin's  Soviet Empire had placed  throughout  the  United\nKingdom  and  the United States in the 1930's to be  awakened  at\nsome  future  date to carry out strikes against  the  enemy  from\nwithin.  The only difference with Ahmed's men was that they  were\ntrained  to die, not to survive.  And unlike their Mole  counter-\nparts, they were awake the entire time, focused on their mission.\nClearly  it was only a matter of time before they would be  asked\nto  follow orders with blind obedience.  Their only reward was  a\nplace in the Muslim heaven.\n\nMeanwhile,  while  awaiting  sainthood, their task  was  to  find\nothers with similar inclinations, or those who could be corralled\ninto their system of beliefs.  It was unrealistic, they knew,  to\nexpect to find an entire army of sympathizers who would fight  to\nthe death or perform suicide missions in the name of Allah.   But\nthey  found it was very easy to find many men, never  women,  who\nwould  follow  orders  and perform the tasks  of  an  underground\ninfantryman.\n\nThe mass influx of Arabs into the United States was another great\nmistake  of the Reagan '80's as it opened its doors to  a  future\nenemy.  The immigration policy of the U.S. was the most  open  in\nthe  entire world.  So, the Government allowed the entry of  some\nof  the world's most dangerous people into the country, and  then\ngave  them  total freedom, with its associated  anonymity.   Such\nthings  could never happen at home, Ahmed thought.  We  love  our\nland  too much to permit our enemies on our soil.  It is so  much\neasier to dispose of them before they can cause damage.\n\nSo  the  thinking went, and Ahmed and his cadre  platooned  them-\nselves often, in any of the thousands of American resort complex-\nes, unnoticed, to gauge the progress of their assignments.\n\nBy  early  1988, Ahmed's army consisted of  nearly  1000  fanatic\nMuslims  who would swallow a live grenade if the deed  guaranteed\ntheir place in martyrdom. And another several thousand who  could\nbe led into battle under the right conditions.  And more came and\njoined  as  the  ridiculous immigration  policies  continued  un-\nchecked.\n\nThey  were students, businessmen, flight attendants who were  now\nin the United States for prolonged periods of time.  All walks of\nlife  were included in his Army. Some were technicians  or  book-\nkeepers, delivery men, engineers, doctors; most disciplines  were\nrepresented.   Since Ahmed had no idea when, if ever, he and  his\narmy  would  be needed, nor for what purpose, recruiting  a  wide\nrange  of talents would provide Allah with the best odds if  they\nwere ever needed. They were all men.  Not one woman in this man's\narmy, Ahmed thought.\n\nThe  biggest  problem,  just as Farjani had  predicted,  was  the\ngrowing sense of unrest among the troops.  The inner 12 had  been\nprofessionally trained to be patient.  Wait for the right  moment\nto  strike.  Wait for orders.  Do nothing.  Do not disclose  your\nalliances or your allegiances to anyone.  No one can be  trusted.\nExcept your recruiter.  Lead a normal life.  Act like any  Ameri-\ncan  immigrant  who flourishes in his new home.  Do not,  at  all\ncosts, give yourself away.  That much was crucial.\n\nPeriodically,  the  inner 12 would  assign  mundane,  meaningless\ntasks to various of their respective recruits.  Americans  called\nit  busy  work.  But, it kept interest alive, the belief  in  the\neventual  victory  of the Arab Nation against the  American  mon-\ngrels.   It  kept  the life in their  organization  flowing,  not\ndulled  by the prolonged waiting for the ultimate call: Jihad,  a\nholy  war against America, waged from inside its own  unprotected\nborders.  It was their raison d'<130>tre.  The underlying gestalt\nfor their very existence.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     February 6, 1988\n     New York City\n\n\"It is time.\"   Ahmed could not believe the words - music to  his\nears.  It was not a long distance call; too clear.  It had to  be\nlocal.  The caller spoke in Ahmed's native tongue and conveyed an\nexcitement  that immediately consumed him. He sat in  his  wheel-\nchair  at a computer terminal in an engineering lab  at  Columbia\nUniversity's Broadway campus.  While he had hoped this day  would\ncome,  he  also knew that politicians, even  Iran's,  promised  a\nglory  that  often was buried in diplomacy  rather  than  action.\nPraise be Allah.\n\n\"We  are ready.  Always for Allah.\"  Ahmed was nearly  breathless\nwith  anticipation.  His mind wandered.  Were we at war?  No,  of\ncourse  not.   The spineless United States would never  have  the\nstrength nor will to wage war against a United Arab State.\n\n\"That is good.  For Allah.\"  The caller agreed with Ahmed.   \"But\nit is not the war you expect.\"\n\nAhmed was taken aback.  He had not known what to expect, exactly,\nbut,  over the months he had conjured many scenarios of  how  his\ntroops  would be used to perform Allah's Will.  His mind  reeled.\n\"For whom do you speak?\"  Ahmed asked pointedly. There was a hint\nof distrust in the question.\n\n\"Farjani  said you would ask.  He said, 'there hasn't been a  war\non U.S. soil since 1812'.  He said you would understand.\"\n\nAhmed understood. Only someone that was privy to their  conversa-\ntions would have known that.  His heart quickened with  anticipa-\ntion.  \"Yes, I understand.  With whom do I speak?\"   Ahmed  asked\nreverently.\n\n\"My  name  is of no consequence.  I am only a humble  servant  of\nAllah  with a message.  You are to follow  instructions  exactly,\nwithout reservation.\"\n\n\"Of  course.  I, too, am but a servant of God.  What are  my  in-\nstructions?\"   Ahmed  felt like standing at parade  attention  if\nonly he had legs.\n\n\"This  will not be our war.  It will be another's.  But our  pur-\nposes are the same.  You will act as his army, and are to  follow\nhis  every request.  As if Allah came to you and so ordered  him-\nself.\"\n\nAhmed beamed.  He glowed with perspiration.  Finally.  The chance\nto act.  He would and his army would perform admirably.  He  lis-\ntened  carefully  as the anonymous caller gave him  his  instruc-\ntions.  He  noted  the details as disbelief sank  in.    This  is\nJihad?   Yes, this is Jihad.  You are expected to comply.   I  am\nclear,  but  are you sure?  Yes, I am sure.  Then I  will  follow\norders. As ordered.  Will we speak again?  No, this is your task,\nyour  destiny.  The Arab Nation calls upon you now.  Do  you  an-\nswer?  Yes, I answer. I will perform. We, our army will perform.\n\n\"Insha'allah.\"\n\n\"Yes, God willing.\"\n\nAhmed  Shah put his teaching schedule on hold by asking  for  and\nreceiving  an  immediate sabbatical.  He then booked and  took  a\nflight to Tokyo three days later.\n\n\"I need an army, and I am told you can provide such services  for\nme.   Is that so?\"  Homosoto asked Ahmed Shah though  he  already\nknew the answer.\n\nAhmed Shah and Taki Homosoto were meeting in a private palace  in\nthe  outskirts  of  Tokyo.  Ahmed wasn't quite sure  to  whom  it\nbelonged,  but  he  was following orders and in no  way  felt  in\ndanger.  The grounds were impeccable, a Japanese Versailles.  The\nweather  was cool, but not uncomfortably so.  Both men sat  under\nan  arbor  that  would be graced with cherry blossoms  in  a  few\nmonths.  Each carried an air of confidence, an assurity not meant\nas  arrogance, but rather as an assertion of control, power  over\ntheir respective empires.\n\n\"How  large  is you army?\"  Homosoto knew the answer,  but  asked\nanyway.\n\n\"One  thousand  to the death.  Three thousand  to  extreme  pain,\nanother ten thousand functionaries.\"  Ahmed Shah said with pride.\n\nHomosoto laughed a convivial Japanese laugh, and lightly  slapped\nhis knees.  \"Ah, comrade.  To the death, so familiar, that is why\nyou  are here, but, I hope that will not be necessary.  You  see,\nthis war will be one without bullets.\"  Homosoto said waiting for\nthe volatile Arab's reaction.\n\nThis was exactly what Ahmed feared.  A spineless war.  How  could\none afford to wage a war against America and not expect,  indeed,\nplan  for, the death of some troops.  There was no Arab  transla-\ntion for pussy-wimp, but the thought was there.\n\n\"How may I be of service?\"\n\n\"The  task is simple.  I have need of information, much  informa-\ntion that will be of extreme embarrassment to the United  States.\nTheir Government operates illegally, their companies control  the\ncountry with virtual impunity from law.  It is time that they are\ntried for their crimes.\"  Homosoto tailored his words so that his\nguest would acquire an enthusiasm similar to his.\n\n\"Yes,\"  Ahmed  agreed.  \"They need to learn a lesson.   But,  Mr.\nHomosoto,  how  can that be done without weapons?  I  assume  you\nwant  to attack their planes, their businesses,  Washington  per-\nhaps?\"   Ahmed was hopeful for the opportunity to give his  loyal\ntroops the action they desired.\n\n\"In a manner of speaking, yes, my friend.  We shall strike  where\nthey  least  expect it, and in a way in which  they  are  totally\nunprepared.\"   Homosoto softened his speech to further his  pitch\nto  gain Ahmed Shah's trust and unity.  \"I am well aware  of  the\ntypes  of training that you  and your people have  gone  through.\nHowever,  you must be aware, that Japan is the  most  technically\nadvanced country in the world, and that we can accomplish  things\nis  a less violent manner, yet still achieve the same goals.   We\nshall  be much more subtle.  I assume you have been  informed  of\nthat by your superiors.\"  Homosoto waited for Ahmed's response.\n\n\"As  you say, we have been trained to expect, even welcome  death\nin the struggle against our adversaries.  Yet I recognize that  a\njoint  effort  may be more fruitful for all of us.  It may  be  a\ndisappointment to some of my people that they will not be permit-\nted  the  honor  of martyrdom, but they are  expected  to  follow\norders.   If they do not comply, they will die without the  honor\nthey crave.  They will perform as ordered.\"\n\n\"Excellent.   That  is as I hoped.\"  Homosoto beamed at  the  de-\nveloping understanding.  \"Let me explain.  My people will provide\nyou with the weapons of this new war, a type of war never  before\nfought.   These  are technological weapons that do not  kill  the\nenemy. Better, they expose him for what he is.  It will be up  to\nyour  army  to  use these weapons and allow us  to  launch  later\nattacks against the Americans.\n\n\"There  are  to be no independent actions  or  activities.   None\nwithout  my  and your direction and approval.  Can you  abide  by\nthese conditions?\"\n\n\"At  the request of my Government and Allah, I will be  happy  to\nserve  you  in  your war.  Both our goals will  be  met.\"   Ahmed\nglowed at the opportunity to finally let his people do  something\nafter so much waiting.\n\nHomosoto  arose and stood over Ahmed.  \"We will make  a  valuable\nalliance.   To  the destruction of America.\"  He held  his  water\nglass to Ahmed.\n\nAhmed responded by raising his glass.  \"To Allah, and the cause!\"\n\nThey  both drank deeply from the Perrier.  Homosoto had one  more\nquestion.\n\n\"If one or more off your men get caught, will they talk?\"\n\n\"They will not talk.\"\n\n\"How can you be so sure?\"  Homosoto inquired naively.\n\n\"Because, if they are caught, they will be dead.\"\n\n\"An excellent solution.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 10\n\n     Tuesday, October 13\n     New York\n\n     COMPUTER ASSAULT CLAIMS VICTIMS\n     by Scott Mason\n\nFor the last few weeks the general press and computer media  have\nbeen  foretelling  the destruction to be caused  by  this  year's\nversion  of the dreaded Columbus Day Virus.  AKA Data Crime,  the\nvirus began exploding yesterday and will continue today,  depend-\ning upon which version strikes your computer.\n\nWith  all of the folderall by the TV networks and news  channels,\nand the reports of anticipated doom for many computers, I expect-\ned  to wake up this morning and learn that this paper didn't  get\nprinted,  my train from the suburbs was rerouted to Calcutta  and\nManhattan's  traffic  lights were out of order.   No  such  luck.\nAmerica is up and running.\n\nThat  doesn't mean that no one got struck by computer  influenza,\nthough.   There are hundreds of reports of widespread  damage  to\nmicrocomputers everywhere.\n\nThe Bala Cynwyd, PA medical center lost several weeks of records.\nCredit  Card International was struck in Madrid, Spain and  can't\nfigure out which customers bought what from whom.  A few  schools\nin England don't know who their students are, and a University in\nupstate New York won't be holding computer classes for a while.\n\nWilliam  Murray of the Institute for Public Computing  Confidence\nin  Washington, D.C., downplayed the incident.  \"We have had  re-\nports  of several small outbreaks, but we have not heard  of  any\nparticularly  devastating  incidents.  It seems that only  a  few\nisolated sites were affected.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Bethan Fenster from Virus Stoppers in  McLean,\nVirginia,  maintains  that the virus damage was much  more  wide-\nspread.  She  says the outbreaks are worse than reported  in  the\npress.  \"I personally know of several Fortune 100 companies  that\nwill  be  spending the next several weeks putting  their  systems\nback in order.  Some financial institutions have been nearly shut\ndown  because  their computers are inoperable.   It's  the  worst\n(computer) virus outbreak I've ever seen.\"\n\nVery  few companies would confirm that they had been affected  by\nthe  Columbus Day Virus.  \"They won't talk to you,\"  Ms.  Fenster\nsaid.  \"If a major company announced publicly that their  comput-\ners were down due to criminal activity, there would be a  certain\nloss of confidence in that company.  I understand that they  feel\na fiduciary responsibility to their stockholders to minimize  the\neffects of this.\"\n\nDespite  Ms.  Fenster's position, Forsythe  Insurance,  NorthEast\nAirlines, Brocker Financial and the Internal Revenue Service  all\nadmitted that they have had a 'major' disruption in their comput-\ner  services  and expect to take two to six weeks to  repair  the\ndamage.  Nonetheless, several of those companies hit, feel lucky.\n\n\"We  only  lost about a thousand machines,\"  said  Ashley  Marie,\nsenior  network  manager at Edison Power.  \"Considering  that  we\nhave  no means of protecting our computers at all, we could  have\nbeen  totally  put out of business.\"  She said that  despite  the\ncost  to repair the systems, her management feels no need to  add\nsecurity  or  protective measures in the future.   \"They  believe\nthat  this  was a quirk, a one time deal.   They're  wrong,\"  Ms.\nMarie said.\n\nMany  small companies that said they have almost been put out  of\nbusiness  because  they were struck by the  Columbus  Day  Virus.\n\"Simply not true,\" commented Christopher Angel of the  Anti-Virus\nBrigade,  a vigilante group who professes to have access to  pri-\nvate information on computer viruses.  \"Of all of the reports  of\ndowned  computers  yesterday,  less than 10% are  from  the  Data\nCrime.   Anyone who had any sort of trouble is blaming it on  the\nvirus  rather than more common causes like  hardware  malfunction\nand  operator error.  It is a lot more glamorous to  admit  being\nhit  by  the virus that has created near hysteria over  the  last\nmonth.\"\n\nWhatever the truth, it seems to be well hidden under the guise of\npolitics.   There is mounting evidence and concern that  computer\nviruses and computer hackers are endangering the contents of  our\ncomputers.  While the effects of the Columbus Day Virus may  have\nbeen  mitigated by advance warnings and  precautionary  measures,\nand  the actual number of infection sites very limited,  computer\nprofessionals are paying increasing attention to the problem.\n\nThis is Scott Mason, safe, sound and uninfected.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Wednesday, October 14\n     J. Edgar Hoover Building, FBI Headquarters\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nThe sweltering October heat wave of the late Indian summer  pene-\ntrated the World War II government buildings that surrounded  the\nMall and the tourist attractions.  Window air conditioners didn't\nprovide the kind of relief that modern workers were used to.  So,\nshirtsleeves  were rolled up, the nylons came off, and ties  were\nloose if present at all.\n\nThe streets were worse.  The climatic changes that graced much of\nNorth  America were exaggerated in Washington. The heat was  hot-\nter,  the  humidity wetter.  Sweat was no longer  a  five  letter\nword, it was a way of life.\n\nUnion  Station,  the  grand old train station  near  the  Capitol\nBuilding provided little relief.  The immense volume of air to be\ncooled  was too much for the central air conditioners. They  were\nno match for mother nature's revenge on the planet for  unforgiv-\ning  hydrocarbon emissions.  As soon as Tyrone  Duncan  detrained\nfrom  the elegant Metroliner he had ridden this morning from  New\nYork's Penn Station, he was drenched in perspiration.  He discov-\nered, to his chagrin, that the cab he had hailed for his ride  to\nheadquarters  had no air conditioning.  The stench of  the  city,\nand the garbage and the traffic fumes reminded him of home.   New\nYork.\n\nTyrone showed his identification at the J. Edgar Hoover  Building\nwishing he had the constitution to wear a seersucker suit.  There\nis no way on God's earth a seersucker could show a few hours wear\nas desperately as his $1200 Louis Boston did, he thought.   Then,\nthere  was the accompanying exhaustion from his exposure  to  the\ndense Washington air. Duncan had not been pleased with the  panic\ncall  that forced him to Washington anyway. His reactions to  the\neffects of the temperature humidity index did not portend a  good\nmeeting with Bob Burnson.\n\nBob had called Tyrone night before, at home.  He said, we have  a\nsituation here, and it requires some immediate attention.   Would\nyou  mind being here in the morning?  Instead of a  question,  it\nwas  an  unissued order.  Rather than fool around with  hours  of\ndelays at La Guardia and National Airport, Tyrone elected to take\nthe train and arrive in the nation's capitol just after noon.  It\ntook, altogether just about the same amount of time, yet he could\ntravel  in  relative luxury and peace.  Burnson was  waiting  for\nhim.\n\nBob  Burnson held the title of National Coordinator for  Tactical\nResponse  for the FBI. He was a little younger that Duncan,  just\nover  40,  and appeared cool in his dark blue  suit  and  tightly\ncollared  shirt.  Burnson had an unlikely pair of qualities.   He\nwas both an extraordinarily well polished politician and a astute\ninvestigator.   Several years prior, though, he decided that  the\nbureaucratic life would suit him just fine, and at the expense of\nhis investigative skills, he attacked the political ladder with a\nvengeance.\n\nDespite the differences between them, Burnson a willing compatri-\not of the Washington machine and Duncan preferring the rigors  of\ninvestigation, they had developed a long distance friendship that\nsurvived  over the years.  Tyrone was most pleased that he had  a\nboss  who would at least give his arguments a fair listen  before\nbeing told that for this or that political reason, the Bureau had\nchosen a different line of reasoning.  So be it, thought  Duncan.\nI'm not a policy maker, just a cop.  Tyrone sank into one of  the\ngovernment  issue chairs in Burnson's modern, yet  modest  office\nringed with large windows that can't open.\n\n\"How  'bout that Arctic Chill?\"  Burnson's short lithe 150  pound\nframe showed no wear from the heat.  \"Glad you could make it.\"\n\n\"Shee  .  . .it man,\" Tyrone exhaled as he wiped  his  shiny  wet\nblack face and neck.  He was wringing wet.  \"Like I had a choice.\nIf  it  weren't for the company, I'd be at the  beach  getting  a\ntan.\"  He continued to wipe his neck and head with a  monogrammed\nhandkerchief.\n\n\"Lose  a few pounds, and it won't hurt so bad. You know, I  could\nmake an issue of it,\"  Bob poked fun.\n\n\"And I'm outta here so fast, Hoover'll cheer from his grave,\"  he\nsweated.   The reference to the FBI founder's  legendary  bigotry\nwas a common source of jokes in the modern bureau.\n\n\"No  doubt.  No doubt.\"  Burnson passed by the  innuendo.  \"Maybe\nwe'd balance the scales, too.\" He dug the knife deeper in  refer-\nence to Tyrone's weight.\n\n\"That's two,\" said Duncan.\n\n\"Ok, ok,\" said Burnson feigning surrender.  \"How's Arlene and the\nrest  of the sorority?\"  He referred to the house full  of  women\nwith whom Tyrone had spent a good deal of his life.\n\n\"Twenty degrees cooler.\"  He was half serious.\n\n\"Listen, since you're hear, up for a bite?\"  Bob tried.\n\n\"Listen,  how  'bout we do business then grab a  couple  of  cold\nones.   Iced  beer.   At Camelot?  That's my idea  of  a  quality\nafternoon.\"  Camelot was the famous downtown strip joint on  18th\nand M street that former Mayor Marion Berry had haunted and  been\n86'd from for unpublished reasons.  It was dark and frequented by\ngovernment  employees for lunch, noticeably the ones from  Treas-\nury.\n\n\"Deal.  If you accept.\"  Bob's demeanor shifted to the officious.\n\n\"Accept what?\" Tyrone asked suspiciously.\n\n\"My proposition.\"\n\n\"Is  this another one of your lame attempts to promote me  to  an\noffice job in Capitol City?\"\n\n\"Well,  yes and no.  You're being re-assigned.\"  No easy  way  to\nsay it.\n\n\"To what?\" exclaimed Tyrone angrily.\n\n\"To ECCO.\"\n\n\"What the hell is ECCO?\"\n\n\"All  in good time. To the point,\" Bob said calmly. \"How much  do\nyou know about this blackmail thing?\"\n\n\"Plenty.   I read the reports, and I have my own local  problems.\nNot to mention that the papers have picked it up.  If it  weren't\nfor  the  National Expos printing irresponsibly,  the  mainstream\npress  would  have  kept  it quiet  until  there  was  some  con-\nfirmation.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\"  said  Burnson.  \"They are being spoken to  right  now,\nabout  that very subject, and as I hear it, they will  have  more\nlawsuits on their doorstep than they can afford to defend.   They\nreally blew it this time.\"\n\n\"What else?\"  Bob was listening intently.\n\n\"Not much.  Loose, unfounded innuendo, with nothing to follow up.\nReminds me of high school antics or mass hysteria.  Just like UFO\nflaps.\"  Tyrone Duncan dismissed the coincidences and the thought\nof  Scott's conspiracy theory.  \"But it does make for a busy  day\nat the office.\"\n\n\"Agreed, however, you only saw the reports that went on the wire.\nNot the ones that didn't go through channels.\"\n\n\"What  do you mean by that?\"  Duncan voiced concern at being  out\nof the loop.\n\n\"What's  on the wire is only the tip of the iceberg.   There's  a\nlot more.\"\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"Senators  calling  the Director personally, asking  for  favors.\nTrying  to keep their secrets secret.  A junior  Midwest  senator\nhas some quirky sexual habits.  A Southern anti-pornography ball-\nbreaker happens to like little boys.  It goes on and one. They've\nall received calls saying that their secrets will be in the news-\npapers' hands within days.\"\n\n\"Unless?\"  Duncan awaited the resolved threat.\n\n\"No unless, which scares them all senseless.  It's the same story\neverywhere.   Highly  influential people who manage many  of  our\ncountries' strategic assets have called their senators, and asked\nthem to insure that their cases are solved in a quiet and expedi-\nent political manner.  Sound familiar?\"  Burnson asked Duncan.\n\n\"More than vaguely,\" Tyrone had to admit.  \"How many?\"\n\n\"As  of this morning we have 17 Senators asking the FBI  to  make\ndiscreet investigations into a number of situations.  17!  Not to\nmention  a  couple  hundred  executive  types  with  connections.\nWithin  days  of  each other.  They each, so  far,  believe  that\ntheirs is an isolated incident and that they are the sole  target\nof  such  .  . .threats is as good a word as  any.   Getting  the\npicture?\"\n\nTyrone whistled to himself.  \"They're all the same?\"\n\n\"Yes,  and there's something else.  To a man, each  claimed  that\nthere was no way the blackmailer could know what he knew.  Impos-\nsible.\"   Burnson  scratched  his head.   \"Strange.   Same  story\neverywhere.   That's what got the Director and his cronies in  on\nthis.   And  then me . . .and that's why you're  here,\"   Burnson\nsaid with finality.\n\n\"Why?\"  Tyrone  was getting frustrated with the  roundabout  dia-\ntribe.\n\n\"We're  pulling the blackmail thing to the national office and  a\nspecial task force will take over.  A lot of folks upstairs  want\nto  pull you in and stick you in charge of the  whole  operation,\nbut I told them that you weren't interested, that you like it the\nway it is.  So, I struck a deal.\"  Burnson sounded proud.\n\nDuncan  wasn't convinced.  \"Deal?  What deal?  Since when do  you\ntalk  for  me?\"  Tyrone didn't think to thank Bob for  the  front\nline pass interference.  Keep the politicos out of his hair.\n\n\"Have  you been following any of the computer madness  recently?\"\nBurnson spoke as though he expected Tyrone to know nothing of it.\n\n\"Can't  miss it.  From what I hear, a lot of people  are  getting\npretty spooked that they may be next.\"\n\n\"It  gets  more interesting than what the papers say,\"  Bob  said\nwhile  opening a desk drawer.  He pulled out a large  folder  and\nlay it across his desk.  \"We have experienced a few more computer\nincidents than is generally known, and in the last several  weeks\nthere has been a sudden increase in the number of attacks against\nGovernment computers.\"\n\n\"You  mean  the INTERNET stuff and Congress  losing  it's  mind?\"\nTyrone  laughed at the thought that Congress would now use  their\ndowned computers as an excuse for not doing anything.\n\n\"Those  are only the ones that have made it to the  press.   It's\nlot  worse.\"   Bob scanned a few pages of the  folder  and  para-\nphrased  while  reading.  \"Ah, yes, the NPRP,  National  Pretrial\nReporting  Program over at Justice . . .was hit with a series  of\ncomputer  viruses apparently intentionally placed in VMS  comput-\ners, whatever the hell those are.\"  Bob Burnson was not  computer\nfluent, but he knew what the Bureau's computer could do.\n\n\"The Army Supply Center at  Fort Stewart, Georgia had all of  its\nrequisitions  for the last year erased from the  computer.\"   Bob\nchuckled as he continued.  \"Says here that they have had to  pool\nthe  guys'  money  to go to Winn Dixie to buy  toilet  paper  and\nMcDonald's  has  offered a special GI discount until  the  system\ngets back up.\"\n\n\"Ty,\"  Bob said.  \" Some people on the hill have raised  a  stink\nsince their machines went down. Damn crybabies.  So ECCO is being\nactivated.\"\n\n\"What the hell is ECCO?\" Tyrone asked again.\n\n\"ECCO stands for Emergency Computer Crisis Organization.  It's  a\ncomputer crisis  team that responds to . . .well I guess, comput-\ner crises.\"  Bob opened the folder again.  \"It was formed  during\nthe, and I quote, ' . . .the panic that followed the first INTER-\nNET Worm in November of 1988.'\"\n\nTyrone's mouth hung open.  \"What panic?\"\n\n\"The one that was kept under absolute wraps,\" Bob said,  slightly\nlowering  his  voice.  \"At first no one knew  what  the  INTERNET\nevent was about.  Who was behind it.  Why and how it was  happen-\ning.   Imagine  10's of thousands of computers  stopping  all  at\nonce.   It scared the shit out of the National Security  Council,\nremember  we and the Russians weren't quite friends then, and  we\nthought that military secrets were being funneled straight to the\nKremlin.  You can't believe some of the contingency plans I heard\nabout.\"\n\n\"I had no idea . . .\"\n\n\"You  weren't  supposed to,\" Bob added.  \"Very few did.   At  any\nrate, right afterward DARPA established CERT, the Computer  Emer-\ngency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon, and DCA set up a Security\nCoordination Center at SRI International to investigate  problems\nin the Defense Data Network.  Livermore and the DOE got into  the\nact  with  Computer Incident Advisory  Capability.  Then  someone\ndecided that the bureaucracy was still too light and it  deserved\nat  least  a  fourth redundant, overlapping and  rival  group  to\ninvestigate on behalf of Law Enforcement Agencies.  So, there  we\nhave ECCO.\"\n\n\"So what's the deal?\" asked Tyrone.  \"What do I have to do?\"\n\n\"The  Director has asked ECCO to investigate the latest round  of\nviruses  and  the  infiltration of a dozen or  so  sensitive  and\nclassified  computers.\"  Bob watched for Ty's reaction,  but  saw\nnone yet. He wondered how he would take the news.  \"This time, we\nwould  like to be involved in the entire operation from start  to\nfinish.  Make sure the investigation is done right.  We'd like to\nstart nailing some of the bastards on the Federal level.  Besides\nyou  have the legal background and we are treading on  some  very\nnew and untested waters.\"\n\n\"I can imagine.  So what's our role?\"\n\n\"Your role,\" Bob emphasized 'your', \"will be to liaison with  the\nother interested agencies.\"\n\n\"Who else is playing?\" asked Tyrone with trepidation.\n\n\"Uh, that is the one negative,\" stammered Bob.  \"You've got  NSA,\nCIA,  NIST,  the NSC, the JCS and a bunch of  others  that  don't\nmatter.  The only rough spot is the NSA/NIST connection.   Every-\none else is there just to make sure they don't miss anything.\"\n\n\"What's their problem?\"\n\n\"Haven't heard, huh?\" laughed Bob.  \"The press hasn't been  kind.\nThey've  been in such a pissing match for so long  that  computer\nsecurity  work came to a virtual halt and I don't want  to  spoil\nthe surprise, ah, you'll see,\" he added chuckling.\n\nTyrone  sat  back in the chair as he was cool enough now  not  to\nstick to it, closed his eyes and rotated his head to work out the\nkinks.  Bob never had gotten used to Tyrone's peculiar method  of\ndeep thought; he found it most unnerving.\n\nBob's   intents were crystal clear, not that Tyrone  minded.   He\nhad no desire to move to D.C.; indeed he would have quit instead.\nHe  wanted  to stay with the Bureau and the action  but   in  his\ncomfortable New York existence.  Otherwise, no.  But, if he could\nget  Bob  off his back by this one favor.  Sure it might  not  be\nreal    action,    watching   computer    jockies    play    with\nthemselves . . .but it might be an interesting change in pace.\n\n\"Yes, under a couple of condition.\"  Tyrone was suddenly a little\ntoo agreeable and smug after his earlier hesitancy.\n\n\"Conditions? What conditions?\" Bob's suspicion was clear.\n\n\"One.  I do it my way, with no, and I mean, absolutely no  inter-\nference.\"  Duncan awaited a reply to his first demand.\n\n\"What else?\"\n\n\"I get to use who I want to use, inside or outside the Bureau.\"\n\n\"Outside?   Outside?  We can't let this outside.  The last  thing\nin the world we want is publicity.\"\n\n\"You're gonna get it anyway.  Let's do it right this time.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Bob asked somewhat defensively.\n\n\"What I mean is,\" Tyrone spoke up, sounding confident, \"that  the\npress  are already on this computer virus thing and  hackers  and\nall.   So,  let's not advertise it, but when it comes  up,  let's\ndeal with it honest.\"\n\n\"No way,\" blurted out Bob.  \"They'll make it worse than it is.\"\n\n\"I  have that covered.  A friend of my works for a paper, and  he\nis a potential asset.\"\n\n\"What's the trade?\"\n\n\"Not much.  Half day leads, as long as he keeps it fair.\"\n\n\"Anything else?\" Bob asked, not responding to Ty.\n\n\"One last thing,\" Tyrone said sitting up straighter.  \"After this\none,  you promise to let me alone and work my golden  years,  the\nway I want, where I want until my overdue retirement.\"\n\n\"I don't know if I can . . .\"\n\n\"Then forget it,\" interrupted Tyrone.  \"I'll just quit.\"  It  was\nthe penultimate threat and bluff and caught Bob off balance.\n\n\"Wait a minute. You can't hold me hostage . . .\"\n\n\"Isn't that what you're doing to me?\"  Touch<130>!\n\nBob sat back in thought.  To an event, Duncan had been right  on.\nHe had uncannily been able to solve, or direct the solution of  a\ncrime where all others had failed.  And, he always put the Bureau\nin  the best possible light.  If he didn't go with him now,  lose\nhim for sure.\n\n\"And, I may need some discretionary funds.\"  Duncan was making  a\nmental list of those things he thought he needed.  His sources of\ninformation  were the most valuable. Without them, it would be  a\nbad case of babysitting sissy assed bureaucrats staking out their\nground.\n\n\"Yes  to the money.  Ouch, but yes to hands off  your  promotion.\nMaybe, to the reporter.  It's my ass, too, you know.\"\n\n\"You called me,\" Tyrone said calmly.  \"Remember?\"\n\nI  can't win this one, thought Bob.  He's never screwed  up  yet.\nNot big time.  As they say, with enough rope you either bring  in\nthe  gang or hang yourself.    \"I want results.\"  That's all  Bob\nhad  to say.  \"Other than that, I don't give a good goddamn  what\nyou do,\"  Bob resigned.\n\n\"One more thing,\" Tyrone slipped in.\n\n\"What is it?\" Bob was getting exasperated.\n\n\"It happens out of New York, not here.\"\n\n\"But . . .\"\n\n\"No buts.  Period.\"\n\n\"Ok, New York, but you report here when I need you.  Agreed?\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said Tyrone agreeably.  \"Deal?\"\n\n\"Yes, except no with the press, this reporter of yours.  Agreed?\"\n\n\"Whatever,\" Tyrone told Bob.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFrom  his  hotel room, Tyrone Duncan called Scott  Mason  at  his\nhome.  It was after 11P.M. EST, and Ty was feeling no pain  after\nseveral  hours  of drinking and slipping $10  bills  into  garter\nbelts at Camelot.\n\n\"RCA, Russian Division,\"  Scott Mason answered his phone.\n\n\"Don't do that,\" Tyrone slurred.  \"That'll trigger the monitors.\"\n\n\"Oh,  sorry, I thought you wanted the plans for the Stealth  Bom-\nber . . .\"\n\n\"C'mon, man,\" Tyrone pleaded. \"It's not worth the paperwork.\"\n\nScott  choked through his laughter. \"I'm watching  a  Honeymooner\nrerun.  This better be good.\"\n\n\"We need to talk.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Thursday, October 15\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nThe  stunning view of the Potomac was complete with a cold  front\nthat brought a wave of crisp and clear air; a much needed  change\nfrom  the brutal Indian Summer.  His condo commanded a  vista  of\nlights  that reflected the power to manipulate the world.   Miles\nreveled  in it.  He and Perky lounged on his 8th. floor   balcony\nafter  a wonderfully satisfying romp in his waterbed.  For  every\naction there is an equal and opposite reaction.  Sex in a  water-\nbed  meant  the expenditure of the least energy for  the  maximum\npleasure. Ah, the beauty of applied mathematics.\n\nOver the last four years Perky and Miles had seen each other on a\nperiodically  regular basis.  She was a little more than  one  of\nMiles'  sexual release valves.  She was a  semi-sorta-kinda  girl\nfriend,  but wouldn't have been if Miles had known that  she  re-\nported their liaisons back to her boss.  Alex was not  interested\nin how she got her information.  He only wanted to know if  there\nwere any digressions in Miles mission.\n\nThey  sipped  Grande  Fine from oversized  brandy  glasses.   The\nafterglow was magnificent and  they saw no reason to detract from\nit  with meaningless conversation.  Her robe barely  covered  her\nfirm breasts and afforded no umbrage for the triangle between her\nlegs.   She wasn't ashamed of her nakedness, job or no  job.  She\nenjoyed  her time with Miles.  He asked for nothing from her  but\nthe obvious.  Unlike the others  who often asked her for  solici-\ntous introductions to others who wielded power that might further\ntheir own particular lobby.  Miles was honest, at least.  He even\nlet her spend the night upon occasion.\n\nAt  2  A.M., as they gazed over the reflections in  the  Potomac,\nMiles'  phone warbled.  He ignored the first 5 rings  to  Perky's\nannoyance.\n\n\"Aren't you going to answer?\"  Her unspoken thoughts said,<MI> do\nwhatever you have to do to make that infernal noise top.<D>\n\n\"Expecting a call?\"  Miles asked.  His eyes were closed,  convey-\ning his internal peace.  The phone rang again.\n\n\"Miles, at least get a machine.\"  The phone rang a seventh time.\n\n \"Fuck.\"  He stood and his thick terrycloth robe swept behind him\nas he walked into the elegantly simple modern living room through\nthe open glass doors.  He put down his glass and answered on  the\n8th ring.\n\n\"It's  late,\"  he answered.  His 'I don't give a  shit'  attitude\nwas evident.\n\n\"Mr.  Foster,  I am most displeased.\"  It  was  Homosoto.   Miles\ncurled  his lips in disgust as Perky looked in from  her  balcony\nvantage.\n\nMiles breathed heavily into the phone. \"What's wrong now?\"  Miles\nwas trying to verbally show his distaste for such a late call.\n\n\"Our plans were explicit.  Why have you deviated?\"  Homosoto  was\ncontrolled but forthright.\n\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\"  Miles sipped loudly  from\nthe brandy glass.\n\n\"I  have  read about the virus, the computer  virus.   The  whole\nworld in talking about it.  Mr. Foster, you are early.  I thought\nwe had an understanding.\"\n\n\"Hey!\"  Foster yelled into the phone. \"I don't know where you get\noff  calling me at 2 in the morning, but you've got your head  up\nyour ass.\"\n\n\"Excuse  me  Mr. Foster, I do not and could not  execute  such  a\nmotion.   However,  do  not forget we  did  have  an  agreement.\"\nHomosoto was insistent.\n\n\"What the fuck are you talking about?\"  Miles was adamant.\n\n\"Since  you insist on these games, Mr. Foster.  I have read  with\ngreat interest about the so called Columbus Day Virus.  I believe\nyou have made a great error in judgment.\"\n\nMiles had just had about enough of this. \"If you've got something\nto say, say it.\" he snorted into the phone.\n\n\"Mr.  Foster.  Did we not agree that the first major  strike  was\nnot to occur until next year?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Miles said offhandedly.  He saw  Perky open her eyes  and\nlook at him quizzically.  He made a fist with his right hand  and\nmade an obscene motion near his crotch.\n\n\"Then,  what is this premature event?\"  Homosoto persisted.\n\n\"Not mine.\"  Miles looked out the balcony.  Perky was  invitingly\nlicking her lips. Miles turned away to avoid distraction.\n\n\"Mr. Foster, I find it hard to believe that you are not responsi-\nble.\"\n\n\"Tough shit.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"  Homosoto was taken aback.\n\n\"Simple.  You are not the only person, and neither am I, the only\nperson  who has chosen to build viruses or  destructive  computer\nprograms.  We are merely taking a good idea and taking it to  its\nlogical  conclusion as a pure form of offensive weaponsry.   This\none's not mine nor yours.  It's someone elses.\"\n\nThe  phone was silent for a few seconds.  \"You are  saying  there\nare  others?\"   The  childlike naivete was  coming  through  over\n12,000 miles of phone wire.\n\n\"Of course there are.  This will probably help us.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"There  are a hundreds of viruses, but  none as effective as  the\nones  which  we use.  A lot of amateurs use them to  build  their\negos.  Jerusalem-B, Lehigh, Pakistani, Brain, Marijuana, they all\nhave names.  They have no purpose other than self aggrandizement.\nSo,  we  will be seeing more and more viruses  appear  that  have\nnothing  to  do with our efforts.  I do hope you  will  not  call\nevery time you hear of one.  You know our dates. \"\n\n\"Is there no chance for error?\"\n\n\"Oh  yes!  There is, but it will be very isolated if  it  occurs.\nMost  viruses do not receive as much attention as this  one,  and\nprobably  won't until we are ready.  And, as I recall we are  not\nready.\"   Miles  was  tired of the timing for  the  hand  holding\nsession.  Ms. Perkins was beckoning.\n\n\"I hope you are right.  My plans must not be interfered with.\"\n\n\"Our  plans,\" Miles corrected.  \"my ass is on the line,  too.   I\ndon't  need you freaking every time the press reports a  computer\ngoing on the fritz.  It's gonna happen a lot.\"\n\n\"What  will  happen, Mr. Foster?\"  Homosoto was  able  to  convey\ndisgust with a Japanese accent like no other.\n\n\"We've been through this before.\"\n\n\"Then go through it again,\" Homosoto ordered.\n\nMiles turned his back to Perky and sat on the couch inside  where\nhe  was  sure  he could speak in privacy.   \"Listen  here  Homo,\"\nMiles  scowled.  \"In the last couple of years viruses  have  been\nbecome techno-yuppie amusements.  The game has intensified as the\nstakes  have  increased.  Are you aware . . .no I'm  sure  you're\nnot,  that  the experts here say that, besides our  work,  almost\nevery local area network in the country is infected with a  virus\nof one type or another.  Did you know that?\"\n\n\"No,  Mr.  Foster,  I didn't.  How do you know  that?\"   Homosoto\nsounded unconvinced.\n\n\"It's my fucking job to know that. And you run an empire?\"\n\n\"Yes,  I know , and I hope you do, Mr. Foster, that you work  for\nme.\"   Condenscention was an executive Oriental trait that  Miles\nfound unsettling.\n\n\"For now, I do.\"\n\n\"You  do,  and  will until our job is over.  Is  that  clear  Mr.\nFoster?  You have much to lose.\"\n\nMiles  sank deep into the couch, smirking and puckering his  dim-\nples. He wanted to convey boredom.  \"I a job.  You an empire.\"\n\n\"Do not be concerned about me. Good night, Mr. Foster.\"\n\nHomosoto had quickly cut the line.  Just as well, thought  Miles.\nHe  had  enough of that  slant-eyed  slope-browed  rice-propelled\nmother-fucker for one night. He had bigger and better and  harder\nthings to concern him.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     October 31, 1989\n     Falls Church, Virginia.\n\n\"What do you mean gone?\"\n\n\"Gone. Gone.  It's just gone.\"  Fred Porter sounded panicked.\n\nLarry Ferguson, the Senior Vice President of First National  Bank\ndid  not  appreciate the news he was getting  from  the  Transfer\nDepartment  in New York.  \"Would you be kind enough to  explain?\"\nhe said with disdain.\n\n\"Yessir, of course.\" Porter took a deep breath.  \"We were running\na  balance, the same one we run every day.  And every  day,  they\nbalance.   The transfers, the receipts, the charges .  .  .every-\nthing.   When we ran them last night, they didn't add up.   We're\nmissing a quarter billion dollars.\"\n\n\"A quarter billion dollars? You better have one good explanation,\nson.\"\n\n\"I wish I did,\" Porter sighed.\n\n\"All  right,  let's go through it top to bottom.\"  Ferguson  knew\nthat  it was ultimately his ass if $250 Million was really  miss-\ning.\n\n\"It's just as I told you.\"\n\n\"Then tell me again!\" Ferguson bellowed.\n\n\"Yessir, sorry.  We maintain transfer accounts as you know.\"\n\n\"Of course I know.\"\n\n\"During the day we move our transfer funds into a single  account\nand  wait till the end of the day to move the money to  where  it\nbelongs.  We do that because . . .\"\n\n\"I  know why we do it.  Cause for every hundred million  we  hold\nfor  half a day we make $16,000 in interest we don't have to  pay\nout.\"\n\n\"Yessir, but that's not official . . .\"\n\n\"Of course it's not you idiot . . .\"\n\n\"I'm sorry sir.\"\n\n\"As  you  were saying . . .\" Ferguson was glad he had  moved  the\npsychological stress to his underling.\n\n\"When  we  got  to the account, about 9:00 A.M.,  it  was  empty.\nThat's it. Empty. All the money was gone.\"\n\n\"And, pray tell, where did it go?\" Templeton said sarcastically.\n\n\"We  don't  know.  It was supposed to have  been  transferred  to\nhundreds of accounts. Here and abroad.  There's no audit of  what\nhappened.\"\n\n\"Do  you know how long it will take you to pay for this screw  up\nPorter?\"  Templeton demanded.\n\n\"Yessir.\"\n\n\"How long?\"\n\n\"A hundred lifetimes,\" Porter said dejectedly.\n\n\"Longer. A lot longer.\"  Ferguson really knew that Porter  would-\nn't  pay  any price.  As long as the computer records  showed  he\nwasn't  at  fault,  he would continue to be  a  valued  employee.\nFerguson himself was bound to be the scape goat.\n\n\"What do you want me to do, sir?\"  Porter asked.\n\n\"You've  done  enough.   Just wire me the records.  I  need  them\nyesterday.   I have to talk to Weinhauser.\"  Ferguson hung up  in\ndisgust.  It was not going to be a good day.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n               Chapter 11\n\n     Wednesday, November 4\n     The Stock Exchange, New York\n\nWall Street becomes a ghost town by early evening with the  night\npopulation largely consisting of guards, cleaning and maintenance\npeople.   Tightly packed skyscrapers with their  lighted  windows\ncreate  random geometric patterns in the moonless  cityscape  and\nhover ominously over dimly lit streets.\n\nJoe Patchok and Tony Romano worked as private guards on the  four\nto  midnight  shift at the Stock Exchange on Cortland  Street  in\nlower Manhattan.  For a couple of young college guys this was the\nideal  job.   They could study in peace and quiet,  nothing  ever\nhappened, no one bothered them, and the pay was decent.\n\nThey were responsible for the 17th. and 18th. floors which had  a\nsole entrance and exit; controlled access.    This was where  the\ncentral computers for the Stock Exchange tried to maintain sanity\nin  the market.  The abuses of computer trading resulting in  the\nminicrash of 1987 forced a re-examination of the practice and the\nsubsequent  installation  of  computer brakes  to  dampen  severe\nmarket fluctuations.\n\nHundreds  of millions of shares exchanged every day are  recorded\nin  the computers as are the international, futures and  commodi-\nties trades.  The dossiers on thousands upon thousands of  compa-\nnies stored in the memory banks and extensive libraries were used\nto  track  investors, ownership, offerings, filings  and  provide\nrequired information to the government.\n\nTony  sat at the front guard desk while Joe made the next  hourly\ncheck through the offices and computer rooms.  Joe strolled  down\nthe  halls, brilliantly lit from recessed ceiling fixtures.   The\ncorridor  walls  were all solid glass, giving the  impression  of\nmore openness than was really provided by the windowless, climate\ncontrolled,  40%  sterile  environment.   There  was  no  privacy\nworking in the computer rooms.\n\nThe  temperature  and humidity were  optimized;  the  electricity\ncontent  of  air was neutralized both  electrostatically  and  by\nnuclear ionization, and the air cycled and purified once an hour.\nIn  the event of a catastrophic power failure, which is  not  un-\nknown  in  New York, almost 10,000 square feet was  dedicated  to\npower  redundancy  and  battery backup.  In case  of  fire,  heat\nsensors  trigger  the release of halon gas and suck  all  of  the\noxygen  from the room in seconds.  The Stock  Exchange  computers\nreceived the best care.\n\nJoe  tested the handle on the door of each darkened room  through\nthe  myriad  glass hallways.  Without the  computers  behind  the\nglass  walls, it might as well have been a House of Mirrors.   He\nnoticed  that the computer operators who work through  the  night\nwere  crowded  together  at the end of a hall next  to  the  only\ncomputer rooms with activity.  He heard them muttering about  the\ncleaning staff.\n\n\"Hey guys, problem?\" Joe asked.\n\n\"Nah,  we escaped,\" a young bearded man in a white lab coat  said\npointing  into the room. \"His vacuum cleaner made one  God  awful\nnoise, so we came out here til' he was done.\"\n\n\"New cleaning service,\" Joe said offhandedly.\n\nThe  dark complexioned cleaning man wore a starchy white  uniform\nwith  Mohammed's Cleaning Service emblazoned across the  back  in\nbold red letters.  They watched him, rather than clean the  room,\nfiddle with the large barrel sized vacuum cleaner.\n\n\"What's he doing?\"\n\n\"Fixing that noise, I hope.\"\n\n\"What's he doing now?\"\n\n\"He's looking at us and, saying something . . .\"\n\n\"It looks like he's praying . . .\"\n\n\"Why the hell would he . . .\"\n\nThe entire 46 story building instantly went dark and the force of\nthe  explosion  rocked Tony from his seat fifty yards  away.   He\nreached  for the flashlight on his belt and pressed a  series  of\nalarms  on the control panel even though the video monitors  were\nblack and the emergency power had not come on.  Nothing.  He  ran\ntowards the sound of the blast and yelled.\n\n\"Hello?  Hey?\" he yelled nervously into the darkness.\n\n\"Over here, hurry,\" a distant pained voice begged.\n\nTony slid into a wall and stopped. He pointed his flashlight down\none hall.  Nothing.\n\n\"Over here.\"\n\nHe  jumped sideways and pointed the beam onto a twisted  maze  of\nbodies,  some with blood geysering into the air from their  necks\nand arms and legs.  Tony saw that the explosion had shattered the\nglass  walls into thousands of high velocity razor sharp  projec-\ntiles.  The corpses had been pierced, stabbed, severed and  muti-\nlated by the deadly shards.  Tony felt nauseous; he was going  to\nbe sick right then.\n\n\"Tony.\"  A shrapnelled Joe squeaked from the mass of  torn  flesh\nahead of him.\n\n\"Holy shit . . .\"  Tony's legs to turned to jelly as he bent over\nand gagged.\n\n\"Help me!\"\n\nThe force of the blast had destroyed the glass partitions as  far\nas  his light beam would travel.  He pointed the light  into  the\nroom that exploded.  The computer equipment was in shambles,  and\nthen he saw what was left of the cleaning man.  His severed  head\nhad  no recognizable features and pieces of his body were  strewn\nabout.   Tony suddenly vomited onto the river of blood  that  was\nflowing his way down the hallway.\n\n\"I gotta go get help,\" Tony said choking.  He pushed against  the\nwall to give him the momentum to overcome the paralysis his  body\nfelt and ran.\n\n\"No, help me . . .\"\n\nHe ran down the halls with his flashlight waving madly.  The ele-\nvators.   They  were out, too.  Maybe the phone on  the  console.\nDead.   He  picked up the walkie-talkie and  pushed  the  button.\nNothing.  He banged the two way radio several times on the  coun-\nter in the futile hope that violence was an electronic  cure-all.\nDead. Tony panicked and threw it violently into the blackness.\n\nNeither the small TV, nor his portable radio worked.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"I  know  it's  almost midnight,\" Ben Shellhorne  said  into  the\ncellular phone.  He cupped his other ear to hear over the  commo-\ntion at the Stock Exchange building.\n\n\"Quit your bitching.  Look at it this way; you might see dawn for\nthe first time in your life.\"  Ben joked.  All time was equal  to\nBen  but  he knew that Scott said he didn't do  mornings.  \"Sure,\nI'll  wait,\" Ben said in disgust and waited with agitation  until\nScott came back to the phone.  \"Good.  But don't forget that beer\nisn't just for breakfast.\"\n\nHe craned his neck to see that the NYPD Bomb Squad had just  left\nand gave the forensics team the go ahead.  No danger.\n\n\"Listen,\"  Ben said hurriedly. \"I gotta make it quick, I'm  going\nin for some pictures.\"  He paused and then said, \"Yes, of  course\nafter  the bodies are gone.  God, you can be gross.\"   He  paused\nagain.  \"I'll meet you in the lobby.  One hour.\"\n\nBen  Shellhorn, a denizen of the streets, reported  stories  that\nsometimes didn't fit within the  all-the-news-that's-fit-to-print\nmaxim.   Many  barely bordered on the decent, but they  were  all\nwell  done.  For some reason, unknown even to Ben,  he  attracted\nnews  whose  repulsiveness made them that much more  magnetic  to\nreaders.  Gruesome lot we are, he thought.\n\nThat's  why one of his police contacts called him to say  that  a\nbunch  of computer nerds were sliced to death.  The Cheers  rerun\nwas  bringing him no pleasure, so sure, what the hell; it  was  a\nnice night for a mutilation.\n\n\"It's  getting mighty interesting, buddy boy,\" Ben  said  meeting\nScott  as  he stepped out of his filthy Red 911 in front  of  the\nStock  Exchange an hour later.  His press  credentials  performed\nwonders  at  times.   Like getting behind police  lines  and  not\nhaving to park ten blocks away.\n\nThe  police  had  brought in generators to power  huge  banks  of\nlights  to eerily light up the Stock Exchange building,  all  500\nfeet  of it.  Emergency vehicles filled the wide  street,  every-\nthing  from ambulances, fire engines, riot vehicles and New  York\nPower.   Then  there were the DA's office, lawyers  for  the  Ex-\nchange, insurance representatives and a ton of computer people.\n\n\"What the hell happened here?\" Scott asked looking at the  pande-\nmonium  on the cordoned off Cortland Street.  \"Where are all  the\nlights?\"   He turned and gazed at the darkened streets  and  tall\nbuildings.   \"Did you know a bunch of the street lights are  out,\ntoo?\"  Scott meandered in seeming awe of the chaos.\n\n\"This is one strange one,\" Ben said as they approached the build-\ning  entrance.  \"Let me ask you a question,  you're  the  techno-\nfreak.\"\n\nScott scowled at him for the reference but didn't comment.\n\n\"What kind of bomb stops electricity?\"\n\n\"Electricity?   You mean power?\"  Scott pointed at the  blackened\nbuildings  and streets and Ben nodded.  \"Did they blow the  block\ntransformers?\"\n\n\"No, just a small Cemex, plastic, bomb in one computer room.  Did\nsome damage, but left an awful lot standing.  But the death  toll\nwas  high.   Eleven dead and two probably not going to  make  it.\nPlus the perp.\"\n\nScott  gazed around the scene.  The dark sky was pierced  by  the\ntop  floors of the World Trade Center, and there were  lights  in\nthe  next  blocks.  So it's not a blackout.  And  it  wasn't  the\npower  grid that was hit.  A growing grin preceded Scott  shaking\nhis head side to side.\n\n\"What is it?\"  Ben asked.\n\n\"A nuke.\"\n\n\"A nuke?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's it, a nuke,\" Scott said excitedly.  \"A nuke  knocks\nout power. Of course.\"\n\n\"Right,\"  Ben  said mockingly.  \"I can hear it  now:  Portion  of\n17th.  Floor  of Exchange Devastated by Nuclear  Bomb.   News  at\nEleven.\"\n\n\"Never  mind,\" Scott brushed it off.  \"Can we get up there?\"   He\npointed at the ceiling.  \"See the place?\"\n\nBen pulled a few strings and spent a couple of hundred of Scott's\ndollars  but succeeded in getting to the corpse-less site of  the\nexplosion.  Scott visually poked around the debris and noticed  a\ncurved  porcelain remnant near his feet.  He wasn't  supposed  to\ntouch,  but, what was it?  And the ruby colored chunks of  glass?\nIn  the  few seconds they were left alone, they snapped  a  quick\nroll  of  film and made a polite but hasty departure. At  $200  a\nminute Scott hoped he would find what he was looking for.\n\n\"Ben, I need these photos blown up, to say, 11 X 17?  ASAP.\"\n\nThe  press conference at 4:15 in the morning was necessary.   The\nStock Exchange was not going to open Thursday.  The lobby of  the\nStock  Exchange was aflood with TV camera lights, police and  the\nmedia hoards.  Voices echoed loudly, between the marble walls and\nfloor and made hearing difficult.\n\n\"We  don't  want  to predict what will happen over  the  next  24\nhours,\"  the  exhausted stocky spokesman for the  Stock  Exchange\nsaid loudly, to make himself heard over the din.  \"We have  every\nreason  to expect that we can make a quick transition to  another\nsystem.\"\n\n\"How is that done?\"\n\n\"We have extensive tape vaults where we store everything from the\nExchange  computers daily.  We will either use one of our  backup\ncomputers, or move the center to a temporary location.  We  don't\nanticipate any delays.\"\n\n\"What  about the power problem?\" A  female reporter from a  local\nTV news station asked.\n\n\"Con  Ed is on the job,\" the spokesman said,  pleased  they  were\npicking on someone else.  \"I have every confidence they will have\nthings up and flying soon.\"\n\n\"What caused the power outage?\"\n\n\"We don't have the answer to that now.\"\n\nScott  edged to the front of the crowd to ask a question.   \"What\nif,\"  Scott asked the spokesman. \"if the tapes were destroyed?\"\n\n\"Thank God they weren't . . .\" he said haltingly.\n\n\"Isn't  it  true,\" Scott ventured accusingly, \"that in  fact  you\nalready know that every computer in this building is dead, all of\nthe emergency power backup systems and batteries failed and  that\nevery  computer  tape or disk has been completely  erased?\"   The\nother reporters stood open mouthed at the unexpected question.\n\nScott spoke confidently, knowing that he was being filmed by  the\nnetworks.   The spokesman nervously fumbled with some  papers  in\nhis hand.  The press pool waited for the answer that had silenced\nthe  spokesman.   He stammered, \"We have no . . .until  power  is\nrestored a full determination of the damage cannot be made . . .\"\n\nScott  pressed the point.  \"What would happen if the  tapes  were\nall erased?\"\n\n\"Uh,  I, well . . .\" he glanced from side to side.  On  his  left\nwere  two men dressed in matching dark blue suits,  white  shirts\nand sunglasses.  \"It is best not to speculate until we have  more\ninformation.\"\n\n\"Computer experts have said that if the tapes are erased it would\ntake  at least thirty days to recreate them and get the  Exchange\nopen  again.  Is that correct?\"    Scott exaggerated. He was  the\ncomputer expert to whom he referred.  Journalistic license.\n\n\"Under  the conditions,\" the spokesman said trying to maintain  a\ncredible  visage to front for his lies, \"I also have  heard  some\nwildly exaggerated estimates.  Let me assure you,\" the politician\nin  him came out here.  \"that the Exchange will in no way  renege\non its fiduciary responsibilities to the world financial communi-\nty.\"  He glanced at his watch.  \"I'm afraid that's all the time I\nhave  now.   We will meet here again at 9:00 A.M. for  a  further\nbriefing.  Thank you.\"  He quickly exited under the protection of\nNew  York's  finest  as the reporters  all  shouted   their  last\nquestions.  Scott didn't bother.  It never works.\n\nOne  of  the men in the blue suits leaned over to the  other  and\nspoke quietly in his ear. \"Who is that guy asking all those ques-\ntions?\"\n\n\"Isn't that the reporter the Director was talking about?\"\n\n\"Yeah.  He said we should keep an eye on him.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Thursday,   November 5\n     Tokyo, Japan\n\n     <<<<<<AUTOCRYPT MODE>>>>>>\n\nMR.

THEN MAKE MORE.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday, November 6\n     New York City\n\nThe Stock Exchange didn't open Friday either.\n\nScott  Mason  had made enough of a stink about the  erased  tapes\nthat  they could no longer hide under the cover of computer  mal-\nfunctions.   It  was finally admitted that yes,  the  tapes  were\nneeded to verify all transactions, especially the computer trans-\nactions,  and they had been destroyed along with the entire  con-\ntents  of  the  computer's memory and  hard  disks.   Wiped  out.\nTotally.\n\nThe  Exchange  didn't tell the press that the  National  Security\nAgency had been quietly called in to assist.  The NSA specializes\nin  information gathering, and over the years with tens  of  bil-\nlions  of dollars in secret appropriations, they  have  developed\nextraordinary  methods to extract usable information where  there\nis apparently none.\n\nThe  Exchange couriered a carton of computer tapes to NSA's  Fort\nMeade  where the most sophisticated listening and analysis  tools\nin the world live in acres upon acres of underground laboratories\nand  data processing centers.  What they found did not  make  the\nNSA  happy.  The tapes had in fact been totally erased.  A  total\nunidirectional magnetic pattern.\n\nMany  'erased'  tapes  and disks can be recovered.   One  of  the\npreferred  recovery methods is to use NMR Nuclear Magnetic  Reso-\nnance, to detect the faintest of organized magnetic orientations.\nEven tapes or disks with secret information that have been erased\nmany times can be 'read' after an MNR scan.\n\nThe  electromagnetic  signature left remnant on  the  tapes,  the\nmolecular  alignment of the ferrous and chromium oxide  particles\nin  this case were peculiarly characteristic.  There  was  little\ndoubt.   The NSA immediately called the Exchange and asked  them,\nalmost  ordered  them, to leave the remaining  tapes  where  they\nwere.\n\nIn less than two hours an army of NSA technicians showed up  with\ncrates and vehicles full of equipment.  The Department of  Energy\nwas  right behind with equipment suitable for radiation  measure-\nments and emergency responses.\n\nDOE  quickly  reached  no conclusion.   Not  enough  information.\nInitially  they  had expected to find that someone  had  stumbled\nupon a way to make highly miniaturized nuclear weapons.   The men\nfrom the NSA knew they were wrong.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt  took almost six weeks for the Stock Exchange to  function  at\nits previous levels.  Trading was reduced to paper and less  than\n10,000,000 shares daily for almost two weeks until the  temporary\nsystem was expanded with staff and runners.  Daily trading  never\nwas  able  to exceed 27,000,000 shares until the  computers  came\nback on line.\n\nThe SEC and the Government Accounting Office released preliminary\nfigures  indicating the shut down of the Exchange would cost  the\nAmerican  economy  almost  $50 Billion this  year.   Congress  is\npreparing legislation to provide emergency funding to those firms\nthat were adversely affected by the massive computer failure.\n\nThe  Stock  Exchange has said that it will  institute  additional\nphysical and computer security to insure that there is no  repeat\nof the unfortunate suicide assault.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Sunday, November 8\n     Scarsdale, New York\n\n\"You never cease to amaze me,\" Tyrone said as he entered  Scott's\nultra  modern house.  \"You and this freaking palace.   Just  from\nlooking  at you, I'd expect black lights, Woodstock  posters  and\nsleeping  bags.\"   He couldn't recall if he had ever  seen  Scott\nwear anything but jeans, t-shirts or sweat shirts and  spotlessly\nclean Reeboks.\n\nScott's  sprawling 8000 square foot free form geometric white  on\nwhite  home sat on 2 acres at the end of a long driveway  heavily\ntreed  with evergreens so that seclusion was maintained all  year\nlong.   Featured  in  Architectural Digest,  the  designers  made\ngenerous  use  of  glass brick inside and out.  The  indoor  pool\nboasted  sliding glass walls and a retractable  skylight  ceiling\nwhich gave the impression of outdoor living, even in the midst of\na harsh winter.\n\n\"They're  in the music room.\"  Scott proceeded to open a  set  of\nheavy oak double doors.  \"Soundproof, almost,\" he said  cheerily.\nA  72 inch video screen dominated one wall and next to it  sat  a\nlarge  control center with VCR's, switchers and satellite  tuner.\nScott's audio equipment was as complex as Ty had ever seen and an\narray of speaker systems flanked the huge television.\n\n\"Toys, you got the toys, don't you?\"  joked Tyrone.\n\n\"The only difference is that they cost more,\" agreed Scott.  \"You\nwanna see a toy and a half? I invented it myself.\"\n\n\"Not  another one?\" groaned Tyrone.  \"That idiot golf machine  of\nyours was  . . .\"\n\n\"Capable of driving 350 yards, straight as an arrow.\"\n\n\"And  as I remember, carving up the greens pretty  good.\"   Scott\nand  his  rolling  Golf Gopher had been  thrown  off  of  several\ncourses already.\n\n\"A few modifications, that's all,\"  laughed Scott.\n\nScott  led Tyrone through the immense  family-entertainment  room\ninto a deep navy blue, white accented Euro-streamlined  automated\nkitchen.   It  was like no other kitchen he had  ever  seen.   In\nfact, other than the sinks and the extensive counters, there  was\nno  indication  that this room was intended for  preparing  food.\nScott  flipped a switch and suddenly the deep blue cabinet  doors\nfaded into a transparent tint baring the contents of the shelves.\nThe  fronts  of the stoves, refrigerator and  freezer  and  other\nappliances exposed their function and controls.\n\n\"Holy Jeez . . .\" Ty said in amazement.  Last month this had been\na regular high tech kitchen of the 80's.  Now it was the Jetsons.\n\"That's incredible . . .you invented that?\"\n\n\"No,\"  dismissed Scott.  \"That's just a neat trick of LCD  panels\nbuilt  into  the  cabinets.  This was my idea.\"   He  pressed  an\ninvisible switch and 4 ten inch openings appeared on the  counter\ntop  near  the  sink.  \"Combination  trash  compacter  re-cycler.\nGlass,  plastic,  aluminum, metal and paper.  Comes  out  by  the\ngarbage, ready to go to the center.\"\n\n\"Lazy son of a bitch aren't you?\"  Tyrone laughed loudly.\n\n\"Sure,  I admit my idea of gardening is watching someone mow  the\nlawn.\"   Scott  feigned  offense.  \"But this is in  the  name  of\nGreen.   I bet if you had one, you'd use it and Arlene would  get\noff your ass.\"\n\n\"No way,\" Tyrone objected.  \"My marriage is too good to screw up.\nIt's  the only thing left we still fight about, and we both  like\nit just the way it is. Thanks, but no thanks. I'm old fashioned.\"\n\nScott  showed Tyrone how to use the kitchen and he found that  no\nmatter  what he wanted, there was button for it, a hidden  drawer\nor  a  disguised appliance.  \"I still buy dishwashers  at  Sears.\nHow the hell do you know how to use this stuff,\" Ty said fumbling\nwith the automatic bottle opener which automatically dropped  the\nremoved caps into the hole for the metal compactor.\n\nTyrone  had come over to Scott's house for a quiet  afternoon  of\nSunday football. An ideal time because Arlene had gone to  Boston\nfor the weekend with his daughters.  Freedom!\n\nThey  made it to the Music Room with their beers as  the  kickoff\nwas  midfield.   \"So  how's the promotion  going?\"   Scott  asked\nTyrone in half jest.  Over the last few weeks, Ty had spent  most\nof his time in Washington and what little time was left with  his\nfamily.\n\n\"Promotion my ass. It's the only way I can not get a  promotion.\"\nTyrone added somberly, \"and it may be my last case.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"  Scott asked.\n\n\"It's  gotten outta hand, totally out of hand. We have  to  spend\nmore  time protecting the rights of the goddamned criminals  than\nsolving  crimes.  That's not what it should be about.   At  least\nnot for me.\"\n\n\"You're serious about this,\" Scott said rhetorically.\n\n\"Hey, sooner or later I gotta call it quits,\" Ty replied soberly.\n\"But this computer thing's gonna make my decision easier.\"\n\n\"That's what I asked.  How's the promotion?\"\n\n\"Let's  just  say, more of the same but  different.   Except  the\ninteragency  crap  is amazing.  No one commits to  anything,  and\neverything needs study and nothing gets done.\"  Tyrone sighed.\n\nHe  had been in Washington working with NIST, NSA, DoD and  every\nother  agency that thought it had a vested interest in  computers\nand their protection.  Their coordination with CERT and ECCO  was\na joke, even by government standards.\n\nAt the end of the first quarter, the 49'ers were holding a  solid\n10 point lead.  Scott grabbed a couple more beers and began tell-\ning  Tyrone  about the incident at the Exchange.   The  New  York\nPolice  had taken over the case, declaring sovereignty over  Wall\nStreet and its enclaves.\n\n\"They don't know what they have, however,\" Scott said immodestly.\n\n\"The talk was a small scale nuke . . .\"\n\n\"The  DOE smashed that but fast,\" Scott interrupted.  \"What if  I\ntold you that it was only the computers that were attacked?  That\nthe deaths were merely incidental?\"\n\nTyrone groaned as the 49'ers fumbled the ball.  \"I'd listen,\"  he\nsaid noncommittally.\n\n\"It was a classified magnetic bomb.  NSA calls them EMP-T.\"\n\n\"Empty?  The empty bomb?\" Tyrone said skeptically.   \"Since  when\ndoes NSA design bombs?\"\n\n\"Listen,\"  said Scott trying to get Ty's attention away from  the\nTV. \"Have you ever heard of C-Cubed, or C3?\"\n\n\"No.\" He stared at the San Francisco defense being crushed.\n\n\"Command,  Control and Communications  It's a special  government\nprogram to deal with nuclear warfare.\"\n\n\"Pleasant thought,\" said Tyrone.\n\n\"Yeah, well, one result of a nuclear blast is a terrific  release\nof electromagnetic energy.  Enough to blow out communications and\npower lines for miles.  That's one reason that silos are hardened\n-  to keep the communications lines open to permit the  President\nor whoever's still alive to shoot back.\"\n\n\"Like I said,\" Tyrone shuddered, \"pleasant thought.\"  He  stopped\nsuddenly at turned to Scott.  \"So it was a baby nuke?\"\n\n\"No,  it  was  EMP-T,\"  Scott said in such a  way  to  annoy  Ty.\n\"Electro Magnetic Pulse Transformer.\"  The confusion on  Tyrone's\nface was clear.  \"Ok, it's actually pretty simple.  You know what\ninterference sounds like on the radio or looks like on a TV?\"\n\n\"Sure.  My cell phone snaps, crackles and pops all of the time.\"\n\n\"Exactly.  Noise is simply electromagnetic energy that interferes\nwith the signal. Right?\"  Scott waited for Tyrone to respond that\nhe understood so far.\n\n\"Good.   Imagine  a  magnetic pulse so strong that  it  not  only\ninterferes  with the signal, but overloads the electronics  them-\nselves.   Remember  that electricity and magnetism are  the  same\nforce taking different forms.\"\n\nTyrone shook his head and curled his mouth.  \"Right.  I knew that\nall the time.\"  Scott ignored him.\n\n\"The EMP-T bomb is an electromagnetic explosion, very very short,\nonly a few milliseconds, but incredibly intense.\"  Scott gestured\nto indicate the magnitude of the invisible explosion.  \"That  was\nthe bomb that went off at the Stock Exchange.\"\n\n\"How  can  you possibly know that?\" Tyrone asked with a  hint  of\nprofessional derision.  \"That requires a big leap of faith . . .\"\n\nScott leaned over to the side of the couch and picked up the  two\nitems he had retrieved from the Exchange.\n\n\"This,\" Scott said handing a piece of ceramic material to Ty, \"is\nsuperconducting material.  Real new.  It can superconduct at room\ntemperature.   And this,\" he handed Tyrone a piece of red  glass,\n\"is a piece of a high energy ruby laser.\"\n\nTyrone  turned the curios over and over in his hands.   \"So?\"  he\nasked.\n\n\"By  driving  the output of the laser into a High  Energy  Static\nCapacitive  Tank,  the energy can be discharged  into  the  super\ncoil.   The  instantaneous release of energy creates  a  magnetic\nfield  of millions of gauss.\"  Scott snapped his  fingers.   \"And\nthat's  more than enough to blow out computer and phone  circuits\nas well as erase anything magnetic within a thousand yards.\"\n\nTyrone was now ignoring the football action. He stared alternate-\nly at Scott and the curious glass and ceramic remnants.   \"You're\nbullshitting me, right?  Sounds like science fiction.\"\n\n\"But the fact is that the Stock Exchange still isn't open.  Their\nentire  tape library is gone. Poof!  Empty, thus the name  EMP-T.\nIt  empties computers.  Whoever did this has a real  bad  temper.\nPure  revenge.  They wanted to destroy the information,  and  not\nthe hardware itself.  Otherwise the conventional blast would have\nbeen stronger.  The Cemex was used to destroy the evidence of the\nEMP-T device.\"\n\n\"Where the hell do these bombs come from.\"\n\n\"EMP-T  technology  was  originally developed as part  of  a  Top\nSecret  DARPA project for the DoD with NSA guidance a  few  years\nback.\"\n\n\"Then how do you know about it?\"\n\n\"I did the documentation for the first manuals on EMP-T.  Nothing\nwe got from the manufacturer was marked classified and we  didn't\nknow or care.\"\n\n\"What was the Army going to do with them?\" asked Tyrone, now with\ngreat interest.\n\n\"You  know, I had forgotten all about this stuff until the  other\nnight,  and  then it all came back to me,\"  Scott  said  mentally\nreminiscing.    \"At the time we thought it was a  paranoid  joke.\nAnother  government folly.  The EMP-T was supposed to be shot  at\nthe  enemy  to screw up his battlefield computers and  radar  and\nelectronics  before  the ground troops or helo's went it.   As  I\nunderstand  it, EMP-T bombs are made for planes, and can also  be\nlaunched from Howitzers and tanks.  According to the  manufactur-\ner, they can't be detected and leave a similar signature to  that\nof  a conventional nuclear blast.  If there is such a thing as  a\nconventional nuke.\"\n\n\"Who else knows about this,\" Tyrone asked.  \"The police?\"\n\n\"You  think  the NYPD would know what to look  for?\"  Scott  said\nsnidely. \"Their bomb squad went home after the plastic  explosive\nwas found.\"\n\n\"Right.  Forget where I was.\"\n\n\"Think  about it,\" Scott mused out loud.  \"A bomb  that  destroys\nall of the computers and memory but leaves the walls standing.\"\n\n\"Didn't that asshole Carter want to build a nuke that would  only\nkill people but leave the city intact for the marauding invaders?\nNeutron bombs, weren't they?\"\n\n\"There's obviously nothing immoral about nuking computers,\" Scott\npontificated.  \"It was all part of Star Wars.  Reagan's Strategic\nDefense  included  attacking enemy satellites with  EMP-T  bombs.\nGet  all  of the benefits and none of the fallout  from  a  nuke.\nThere's no accompanying radiation.\"\n\n\"How easy is it to put one of the empty-things together?\"  Tyrone\nmissed another 49'er touchdown.\n\n\"Today?\"   Scott  whistled.   \"The ones I saw  were  big,  clumsy\naffairs  from  the 70's.   With new ceramics, and such,  I  would\nassume  they're  a lot smaller as the Stock Exchange  proves.   A\nwild guess?  I bet that EMP-T is a garage project for a couple of\nwhiz  kids,  or if the government orders them, a  couple  hundred\nthou  each.\"  Scott laughed at the absurdity of competitive  bid-\nding for government projects.   Everyone knew the government paid\nmore for everything.  They would do a lot better with a VISA card\nat K-Mart.\n\n\"I think I better take a look,\"  Tyrone hinted.\n\n\"I thought you would, buddy.  Thought you would.\"  Scott replied.\n\nThey  returned to the game 12 seconds before half time.  The  gun\nwent  off.   Perfect timing.  Scott hated  football.    The  only\nreason  in  his mind for the existence of the Super Bowl  was  to\ndrink beer with friends and watch the commercials.\n\n\"Shit,\" declared Tyrone. \"I missed the whole damned second  quar-\nter.\"  He grabbed another beer to comfort his disappointment.\n\n\"Hey,\" Scott called to Tyrone.  \"During the next half, I want  to\nask you something.\"\n\nTyrone  came back into the Music Room snickering. \"What the  hell\nis that in your bathroom?\"\n\n\"Isn't that great?\" asked the enthused Scott.  \"It's an automatic\ntoilet seat.\"\n\n\"Now just what the devil is an automatic toilet seat? It pulls it\nout  and dries it off for you?\"  He believed that Scott was  kid-\nding with some of his half baked inventions.  That Scott subject-\ned any of his guests to their intermittent functioning was  cruel\nand inhuman punishment according to Tyrone.\n\n\"You're  married  with girls.  Aren't they always  on  your  case\nabout the toilet seat?\"\n\n\"I've  been married 26 years,\" Tyrone said with pride.   \"I  con-\nquered toilet seats on our honeymoon.  She let me know right then\nthat she was boss and what the price of noncompliance was.\"\n\n\"Ouch, that's not fair,\" Scott said in sympathy. \"I  sleep-piss.\"\nHe  held  his hands out in front.  \"That's the only  side  effect\nfrom too much acid.  Sleep pissing.\"\n\nTyrone scrunched his face in disgust.\n\nScott spoke rapidly and loudly. \"So for those of us who forget to\nlower the seat after use, for those who forget to raise the seat;\nfor  those who forget to raise the lid, Auto-Shit.\" Ty had  tried\nto  ignore  him,  but Scott's imitation of  a  hyperactive  cable\nshopping  network host demanded that one at least hear  him  out.\nTy's eyes teared.\n\n\"Make that woman in your life happy today.  No more mess, fuss or\nor  morning arguments.  No more complaints from the neighbors  or\nthe  health department.  Auto-Shit.  The toilet that  knows  your\nneeds.   The  seat for the rest of us.  Available in  6  designer\ncolors.  Only  $49.95, Mastercard, VISA, No COD.   Operators  are\nstanding by.\"\n\nTyrone  fell  over on his side laughing.  \"You  are  crazy,  man.\nSleep pissing.  And, if you don't know it, no one, I mean no  one\nin  his right mind has five trash compactors.\"  Tyrone waved  his\nhand at Scott. \"Ask me what you were gonna ask me.\"\n\n\"Off  the  record, Ty,\" Scott started, \"how're the  feds  viewing\nthis mess?\"\n\nTyrone  hated the position he was in, but Scott had given  him  a\nltoe recently.  It was time to reciprocate.\n\n\"Off?\"\n\n\"So  far  off, so far off that if you turned the  light  \"On\"  it\nwould still be off.\"\n\n\"It's  a fucking mess,\" Tyrone said quickly.  He was relieved  to\nbe able to talk about it.  \"You can't believe it.  I'm down there\nto watch a crisis management team in action, but what do I find?\"\nHe  shook his head.  \"They're still trying to decide on the  size\nof  the  conference table.\"  The reference  caught  Scott's  ear.\n\"No, it's not that bad, but it might as well be.\"\n\n\"How is this ECCO thing put together?  Who's responsible?\"\n\n\"Responsible?  Ha! No one,\" Tyrone chuckled as he  recounted  the\nconstant  battles among the represented agencies.  \"This  is  the\nperfect  bureaucratic solution.  No one is responsible for  shit,\nno  one is accountable, but they all want to run the show.   And,\nno one agency clearly has authority.  It's a fucking disaster.\"\n\n\"No  one  runs security?  In the whole government,  no  one  runs\nsecurity?\"\n\n\"That's pushing it a little, but not too far off base.\"\n\n\"Oh,  I gotta hear this,\" Scott said reclining in the deep  plush\ncloth covered couch.\n\n\"Once  upon a time, a super secret agency, no one ever spoke  the\ninitials,  but it begins with the National Security  Agency,  got\nelected  by the Department of Defense to work out  communications\nsecurity during the Cold War. They took their job very seriously.\n\n\"Then along came NIST and IBM who developed DES.  The DOD  formed\nthe  Computer Security Initiative and then the Computer  Security\nEvaluation Center.  The DOD CSEC became the DOD Computer Security\nand then after NSA realized that everybody knew who they were, it\nbecame the NCSC. Following this?\"\n\nScott nodded only not to disrupt the flow.\n\n\"Ok,  in  1977, Carter signed a bill that said to NSA,  you  take\nover  the  classified national security stuff, but  he  gave  the\ndregs,  the unclassified stuff to the NTIA, a piece of  Commerce.\nBut  that  bill made a lot of people unhappy.   So,  along  comes\nReagan  who  says, no that's wrong, before we get  anything  con-\nstructive  done, let me issue a Directive, number 145,  and  give\neverything back to NSA.\n\n\"That  pissed off even more people and Congress then  passed  the\nComputer  Security Act of 1987, stripped NSA of what it  had  and\ngave  NIST the unclassified stuff.  As a result, NSA  closed  the\nNCSC, NIST is underbudgeted by a factor of 100 and in short, they\nall  want a piece of a very small pie.  That took over  4  years.\nAnd that's whose fault it is.\n\n\"Whose?\"\n\n\"Congress  of  course.  Congress passes the damn  laws  and  then\nwon't fund them.  Result? I get stuck in the middle of third tier\nrival  agency  technocrats fighting over their turf  or  shirking\nresponsibility, and well , you get the idea.  So I've got ECCO to\ntalk  to CERT to talk to NIST to talk to . . .and it goes  on  ad\nnauseum.\"\n\n\"Sorry I asked,\" joked Scott.\n\n\"In other words,\" Ty admitted, \"I don't have the first foggy idea\nwhat  we'll  do.   They all seem hell bent on  power  instead  of\nfixing the problem. And the scary part?\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"It looks like it can only get worse.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Tuesday, November 11\n     White House Press Room\n\n\"Mr.  President,\"  asked the White House correspondent  for  Time\nmagazine.   \"A  recent article in the City Times  said  that  the\nmilitary has been hiding a super weapon for years that is capable\nof  disabling enemy computers and electronics from a  great  dis-\ntance  without any physical destruction.  Is that true, sir,  and\nhas  the use of those weapons contributed to the military's  suc-\ncesses over the last few years?\"\n\n\"Ah,  well,\" the President hesitated briefly.  \"The Stealth  pro-\ngram  was certainly a boon to our air superiority.  There  is  no\nquestion  about  that, and it was kept secret for a  decade.\"  He\nstared to his left,  and the press pool saw him take a visual cue\nfrom  his National Security Director.  \"Isn't that right  Henry?\"\nHenry  Kennedy  nodded  aggressively.  \"We have  the  best  armed\nforces  in  the world, with all the advantages we  can  bring  to\nbear,  and I will not compromise them in any way.  But, if  there\nis  such  a classified program that I was aware  of,  I  couldn't\nspeak  of  it even if I didn't know it existed.\"   The  President\npicked another newsman.  \"Next, yes, Jim?\"\n\nDuring  the next question Henry Kennedy slipped off to the  ante-\nroom  and  called the Director of the National  Security  Agency.\n\"Marv,  how far have you gotten on this EMP-T thing?\"  He  waited\nfor a response.  \"The President is feeling embarrassed.\"  Another\npause.  \"So  the Exchange is cooperating?\"  Pause.   Wait.   \"How\nmany  pieces  are  missing?\"  Pause.  \"That's  not  what  Mason's\narticle said.\"  Longer pause.  \"Deal with it.\"\n\nImmediately  after  the  press conference,  the  President,  Phil\nMusgrave, his Chief of Staff, Henry Kennedy and Quinton  Chambers\nhis old time ally and Secretary of State had an impromptu meeting\nin the Oval Office.\n\nThey sat in the formal Queen Anne furniture as an elegant  silver\ncoffee  and tea service was brought in for the five  men.   Minus\nTreasury  Secreatry Martin Royce, this was the  President'  inner\ncircle, his personal advisory clique who assisted in making grand\nnational  policy.   Anything goes in one of these  sessions,  the\nPresident had made clear in the first days of his Administration.\nAnything.\n\nWe do not take things personally here, he would say.  We have  to\nexplore all options.  All options.  Even if they are distasteful.\nAnd in these meeting, treat me like one of the guys.  \"Yes,  sir,\nMr.  President.\"   The only formality of their caucuses  was  the\nPresident's  fundamental  need to mediate  the  sometimes  heated\ndialogues  between  his  most  trusted  aids.   They  were   real\nfree-for-alls.\n\n\"Henry,\"  the  President said.  \"Before we start,  who  was  that\nreporter?   Where  the hell did that question come up  about  the\nweapon stuff?\"\n\n\"Forget  him. The story started at the City Times.  Scott  Mason,\nsir.\"   Musgrave replied quickly. His huge football center  sized\nbody  overwhelmed the couch on which he sat.  \"He's  been  giving\nextensive coverage to computer crime.\"\n\n\"Well, do we have such a bomb?\" he asked with real curiosity.\n\n\"Ah, yessir,\" Henry Kennedy responded.  \"It's highly  classified.\nBut  the  object is simple.  Lob in a few of the EMP-T  bombs  as\nthey're  called, shut down their communications and control,  and\nmove in during the confusion.  Very effective, sir.\"\n\n\"Well,  let's see what we can do about keeping secrets  a  little\nbetter. O.K., boys?\"  The President's charismatic hold over  even\nhis  dear  friends and long time associates made him one  of  the\nmost  effective  leaders  in years.  If he was  given  the  right\ninformation.\n\nThe President scanned a few notes he had made on a legal pad.\n\n\"Can I forget about it?\"  the President closely scrutinized Henry\nfor any body language.\n\n\"Yessir.\"\n\nThe  President  gave Henry one more glance and  made  an  obvious\npoint of highlighting the item.  The subject would come up again.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                    Chapter 12\n\n     Thursday, November 14\n     NASA Control Center, Johnson Space Center\n\nThe voice of Mission Control spoke over the loudspeakers and into\nhundreds of headsets.\n\nTHE GROUND LAUNCH SEQUENCER HAS BEEN INITIATED.  WE'RE AT T-MINUS\n120 SECONDS AND COUNTING.\n\nThe  Space  Shuttle Columbia was on Launch Pad 3,  in  its  final\npreparation  for  another secret mission.  As was  expected,  the\nDepartment  of Defense issued a terse non-statement on  its  pur-\npose: \"The Columbia is carrying a classified payload will be used\nfor  a  series of experiments.  The flight is scheduled  to  last\nthree days.\"\n\nIn reality, and most everyone knew it, the Columbia was going  to\nrelease  another KH-5 spy satellite.  The KH-5 series  was  able,\nfrom  an altitude of 110 miles, to discern and transmit to  Earth\nphotos  so crisp, it could resolve the numbers on  an  automobile\nlicense  plate.   The photographic resolution of KH-5's  was  the\nenvy  of every government on the planet, and was one of the  most\nclosely guarded secrets that everyone knew about.\n\nT-MINUS 110 SECONDS AND COUNTING.\n\nMission control specialists at the Cape and in Houston  monitored\nevery  conceivable  instrument on the Shuttle itself and  on  the\nground equipment that made space flight possible.\n\nA  cavernous room full of technicians checked and double  checked\nand  triple checked fuel, temperature, guidance,  computers  sys-\ntems,  backup  systems, relays, switches,  communications  links,\ntelemetry,  gyros,  the  astronauts'  physiology,  life   support\nsystems,  power  supplies . . .everything had  a  remote  control\nmonitor.\n\n\"The liquid hydrogen replenish has been terminated, LSU pressuri-\nzation  to flight level now under way.

It showed the actual and  projected\ntrajectories  of the Shuttle.  Along both sides of the  map  were\nseveral  large rear projection video screens. They displayed  the\nvarious  camera  angles of the launch pad, the  interior  of  the\nShuttle's  cargo  hold, the cockpit itself and an  assortment  of\nother  shots that the scientists deemed important to the  success\nof each flight.\n\nT-MINUS 90 SECONDS AND COUNTING\n\n\"At the T-Minus one minute mark, the ground launch sequencer will\nverify that the main shuttle engines are ready to start.\"\n\nT-MINUS 80 SECONDS AND COUNTING\n\n\"Liquid hydrogen tanks now reported at flight pressure.\"\n\nThe  data  monitors scrolled charts and numbers.

Hundreds of voices give  their\nconsent  that their particular areas of responsibility are  ship-\nshape.  The word nominal sounds to laymen watching the world over\nas a classic understatement.  If things are great, then say 'Fuel\nis  Great!'  NASA prefers the word Nominal to indicate that  sys-\ntems  are performing as the design engineers predicted  in  their\nsimulation models.\n\nT-MINUS 50 SECONDS AND COUNTING.\n\nThe  hoses  that connect the Shuttle to the Launch Pad  began  to\nfall away.  Whirls of steam and smoke appeared around portions of\nthe boosters.  The tension was high.  45 seconds to go.\n\n\"SRB flight instrumentation recorders now going to record.\"\n\nEyes riveted to computer screens.  It takes hundreds of computers\nto make a successful launch.  Only the mission generalists  watch\nover  the big picture; the screens across the front of the  behe-\nmoth 80 foot high room.\n\nT-MINUS 40 SECONDS AND COUNTING\n\n\"External tank heaters now turned off in preparation for launch.\"\n\nScreens danced while minds focused on their jobs.

If NASA didn't want it going to the public\nit didn't get sent.\n\nCNN got the first interview with NASA officials.\n\n\"What caused today's flight to be aborted?\"\n\n\"We  detected a slight leak in the fuel tanks.  We  believe  that\nthe  sensors were faulty, that there was no leak, but we felt  in\nthe  interest  of safety it would be best to abort  the  mission.\nOrbital  alignment is not critical and we can attempt a  relaunch\nwithin 2 weeks.

Delays in  the  troubled\nshuttle program are nothing new.  It seems that just about every-\nthing  that can go wrong has gone wrong  in the last  few  years.\nWe watch fuel tanks leak, backup computers go bad, life   support\nsystems malfunction and suffer through a complete range of incom-\nprehensible defects in the multi-billion dollar space program.\n\nWe got to the moon in one piece, but the politics of the  Shuttle\nProgram is overwhelming.\n\nRemember what Senator John Glenn said during his historic 3 orbit\nmission in the early days of the Mercury Program.  \"It worries me\nsome.  To think that I'm flying around up here in a machine built\nby the lowest bidder.\"\n\nAt the time, when the space program had the support of the  coun-\ntry  from the guidance of the young Kennedy and from the fear  of\nthe  Soviet  lead,  Glenn's comment was meant  to  alleviate  the\ntension.   Successfully, at that.  But since the Apollo fire  and\nthe  Challenger disaster, and an all too wide array  of  constant\ntechnical  problems, political will is waning. The  entire  space\nprogram suffers as a result.\n\nYesterday's aborted launch echoes of further bungling.  While the\nmanagement  of NASA is undergoing critical review, and  executive\nreplacements seem imminent, the new breed will have to live  with\npast  mistakes for some time.  Unfortunately, most  Americans  no\nlonger watch space launches, and those that do tune out once  the\nastronauts  are out of camera range.  The Space  Program  suffers\nfrom external malaise as well as internal confusion.\n\nThat is, until yesterday.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, seconds after the countdown was halted,\nNASA  cut its feeds to the networks and all 4 channels were  left\nwith the omnipresent long lens view of the space shuttle  sitting\nidle on its launch pad.  In a prepared statement, NASA blamed the\naborted  flight  on yet another leak from the massive and  explo-\nsive  355,000  gallon fuel tanks.  In what  will  clearly  become\nanother  public  relations  fiasco, NASA lied to  us  again.   It\nappears that NASA's computers were invaded.\n\nCNN  cooped the other three networks by applying advanced digital\nreconstruction  to  a few frames of video.  Before NASA  cut  the\nfeed,  CNN was receiving pictures of the monitor walls from  Mis-\nsion  Control in Houston, Texas.  Normally those banks  of  video\nmonitors contain critical flight information, telemetry,  orbital\npaths and other data to insure the safety of the crew and machin-\nery.\n\nYesterday,  though, the video monitors carried a message  to  the\nnation:\n\nCHRISTA  MCAULIFFE  AND THE CHALLENGER WELCOME THE  CREW  OF  THE\nSPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA.\n\nThis  was  the  message that NASA tried  to  hide  from  America.\nDespite the hallucinations of fringe groups who are  prophesizing\nimminent contact with an alien civilization, this message was not\nfrom  a large black monolith on the Moon or from the Red Spot  on\nJupiter.  A Star Baby will not be born.\n\nThe  threatening  words came from a deranged  group  of  computer\nhackers who thought it would be great sport to endanger the lives\nof  our astronauts,  waste millions of taxpayer  dollars,  retard\nmilitary  space missions and make a mockery of NASA.  After  con-\nfronted  with the undisputed evidence that CNN presented to  NASA\nofficials  within  hours of the attempted launch,  the  following\nstatement was issued:\n\n\"The Space Shuttle Columbia flight performing a military mission,\nwas aborted 5 seconds prior to lift-off.  First reports indicated\nthat  the  reason was a minor leak in a  fuel  line.   Subsequent\nanalysis showed, though, that the Side Band Communications  Moni-\ntoring System displayed remote entry anomalies inconsistent  with\nprogram  launch sequence.  Automatic system  response  mechanisms\nput the count-down on hold until it was determined that intermit-\ntent  malfunctions could not be repaired without a launch  delay.\nThe launch date has been put back until November 29.\"\n\nPermit me to translate this piece of NASA-speak with the straight\nskinny.\n\nThe anomaly they speak of euphemistically was simple:  A computer\nhacker, or hackers, got into the NASA computers and caused  those\nnauseating  words to appear on the screen.  The  implication  was\nobvious.   Their sickening  message was a distinct threat to  the\nsafety of the mission and its crew.  So, rather than an  automat-\nic  systems shut-down, as the CNN tape so aptly  demonstrates,  a\nvigilant technician shouted, \"Look at the g_______ed monitor  for\nChrissakes! Just look!\"\n\nWhile  the  NASA computers failed to notice that  they  had  been\ninvaded  from an outside source, their able staff prevented  what\ncould have been another national tragedy.  Congratulations!\n\nIf computer hackers, those insidious little moles who secretively\npoke  through computer systems uninvited and unchecked,  are  the\nreal  culprits as well placed NASA sources suggest, they need  to\nbe  identified quickly, and be prosecuted to the  fullest  extent\npossible.   There are laws that have been broken.  Not  only  the\nlaws regarding computer privacy, but legal experts say that cases\ncan  be made for Conspiracy, Sedition, Blackmail,  Terrorism  and\nExtortion.\n\nBut, according to computer experts, the likelihood of ever  find-\ning  the interlopers is \" . . .somewhere between never and  none.\nUnless  they left a trail, which good hackers don't, they'll  get\naway with this Scott free.\"\n\nHackers have caused constant trouble to computer systems over the\nyears,  and  incidents have been increasing in  both  number  and\nseverity.  This computer assault needs to be addressed immediate-\nly.  America insists on it.  Not only must the hacker responsible\nfor this travesty be caught, but NASA must also explain how their\ncomputers  can be compromised so easily.  If a bunch of kids  can\nenter one NASA communications computer, then what stops them from\naltering flight computers, life support systems and other comput-\ner controlled activities that demand perfect operation?\n\nNASA, we expect an answer.\n\nThis  is Scott Mason, waiting for NASA to lift-off from its  duff\nand get down to business.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday, November 15\n     New York City.\n\nScott Mason picked up the phone on the first ring.\n\n\"Scott Mason,\" he said without thinking.\n\n\"Mr.  Mason?  This is Captain Kirk.\"  The voice was serious,  but\ndid  not resonate as did the distinctive voice that  belonged  to\nWilliam Shatner.  Scott laughed into the phone.\n\n\"Live long and prosper.\"  Mason replied in an emotionless voice.\n\n\"I need to talk to you,\"  the voice came right back.\n\n\"So  talk.\"  Scott was used to anonymous callers so he  kept  the\nrhythm of the conversation going.\n\n\"You have it all wrong.  Hackers aren't the ones.\" The voice  was\nearnest.\n\n\"What are you talking about?\"  Scott asked innocuously.\n\n\"Your articles keep saying that hackers cause all the trouble  on\ncomputers. You're wrong.\"\n\n\"Says who?\"  Scott decided to play along.\n\n\"Says me.  You obviously don't know about the Code.\"\n\n\"What code?\" This was getting nowhere fast.\n\n\"Listen, I know your phone is tapped,  so I only have another few\nseconds.  Do you want  to talk?\"\n\n\"Tapped?  What  is this all about?\"  The annoyance was  clear  in\nScott's voice.\n\n\"You keep blaming everything on hackers.  You're wrong.\"\n\n\"Prove it.\" Scott gave this phone call another 10 seconds.\n\n\"I've been inside the  NASA computers.\"\n\nThat  got  Scott to wake up from the droll papers  on  his  desk.\n\"Are  you telling me you wrote the message  . . .?\"  Scott  could\nnot contain his incredulity.\n\n\"God,  no.\"  Captain  Kirk was firm. \"Do you have  a  modem?   At\nhome?\"\n\n\"Yeah, so what.\"  Scott gave the caller only another 5 seconds.\n\n\"What's the number?\"\n\n\"Is this love or hate?\"  Time's up thought Scott.\n\n\"News.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"News.   Do I talk to you or the National Expos<130>?  I  figured\nyou might be a safer bet.\"  The voice who called himself  Captain\nKirk gave away nothing but the competitive threat was effective.\n\n\"No contest. If it's real. What have you got?\"  Scott paid atten-\ntion.\n\n\"What's the number?\" the voice demanded. \"Your modem.\"\n\n\"Ok!  914-555-2190.\" Scott gave his home modem number.\n\n\"Be on at midnight.\"  The line went dead.\n\nScott  briefly mentioned the matter to his editor, Doug,  who  in\nturn  gave  him a very hard time about it. \"I  thought  you  said\nvirus hacker connection was a big ho-hum.  As I recall, you  said\nthey weren't sexy enough?  What happened?\"\n\n\"Eating  crow can be considered a delicacy if the main course  is\nphenomonal.\"\n\n\"I see,\" laughed Doug.  Creative way out, he thought.\n\n\"He said he'd been plowing around NASA computers,\" Scott argued.\n\n\"Listen,  ask your buddy Ben how many crackpots admit  to  crimes\njust for the attention.  It's crap.\"  Doug was too jaded, thought\nScott.\n\n\"No,  no,  it's legit,\" Scott said defensively.  \"Sounds  like  a\nhacker conspiracy to me.\"\n\n\"Legit?   Legit?\" Doug laughed out loud.  \"Your last column  just\nabout  called for all computer junkies to be castrated and  drawn\nand  quartered  before they are hung at the stake.  And  now  you\nthink  an  anonymous caller who  claims to be a  hacker,  is  for\nreal?   C'mon, Scott.  You can't have  it both  ways.   Sometimes\nyour conspiracies are bit far fetched . . .\"\n\n\"And when we hit, it sells papers.\"  Scott reminded his boss that\nit was still a business.\n\nNonetheless,  Doug made a point that hit home with Scott.   Could\nhe  both  malign computer nerds as sub-human and then  expect  to\nderive a decent story from one of them?  There was an  inconsist-\nency  there.  Even  so, some pretty  despicable  characters  have\nturned  state's evidence and made decent witnesses against  their\nformer  cohorts.  Had Captain Kirk really been where no  man  had\nbeen before?\n\n\"You  don't care if I dig a little?\" Scott backed off and  played\nthe humble reporter.\n\n\"It's  your  life.\"  That was Doug's way of saying, \"I  told  you\nthere was a story here. Run!\"\n\n\"No  problem, chief.\"  Scott snapped to mock attention  and  left\nhis editor's desk before Doug changed his mind.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Midnight\n     Scarsdale, New York\n\nScott  went  into his study to watch Nightline after  grabbing  a\ncold  beer and turned on the light over his computer.  His  study\ncould by all standards be declared a disaster area, which his ex-\nwife Maggie often did.  In addition to the formal desk, 3 folding\ntables  were piled high with newspapers, loose clippings,  books,\nscattered notes, folders, magazines, and crumpled up paper  balls\non  the  floor.   The maid had refused to clean the  room  for  6\nmonths since he blamed her for disposing of important notes  that\nhe had filed on the floor.  They were back on good terms, he  had\napologized, but his study was a no-man's, or no maid's land.\n\nScott  battled  to  clear a place for his beer  as  his  computer\nbooted up.  Since he primarily used his computer for writing,  it\nwasn't  terribly  powerful by today's standards.   A  mere  386SX\nrunning  at  20 megahertz and comparatively  low  resolution  VGA\ncolor  graphics. It was all he needed.  He had a modem in  it  to\nconnect  to  the paper's computer. This way he  could  leave  the\noffice  early,  write his articles or columns at home  and  still\nhave  them in by deadline.  He also owned a GRiD 386 laptop  com-\nputer for when he traveled, but it was buried beneath a mound  of\ndiscarded  magazines  on  one of the built-in  floor  to  ceiling\nshelves that ringed the room.\n\nScott wondered if Kirk would really call.  He had seemed paranoid\nwhen he called this afternoon.  Phones tapped?  Where did he ever\nget  that idea? Preposterous.  Why wouldn't his phone at home  be\ntapped if the ones at  work were?  We'll see.\n\nScott  turned  the old 9\" color television on the corner  of  the\ndesk to Nightline. Enough to occupy him even if Kirk didn't call.\n\nHe  set  the ComPro communications program  to  Auto-Answer.   If\nKirk, or anyone else did call him, the program would automatical-\nly answer the phone and his computer would alert him that someone\nelse's computer had called his computer.\n\nHe noticed the clock chime midnight as Nightline went overtime to\nfurther  discuss the new Soviet Union.  Fascinating, he  thought.\nI  grow up in the 60's and 70's when we give serious  concern  to\nblowing up the world and today our allies of a half century  ago,\nturned Cold War enemy, are talking about joining NATO.\n\nAt  12:02,  Scott Mason's computer beeped at  him.   The  beeping\nstartled him.\n\nHe looked  at the computer screen as a first message appeared.\n\nWTFO\n\nScott  didn't  know what to make of it, so he  entered  a  simple\nresponse.\n\nHello.\n\nThe computer screen paused briefly then came alive again.\n\nARE YOU SCOTT MASON?\n\nScott entered 'Yes'.\n\nTHIS IS KIRK\n\nScott wondered what the proper answer was to a non-question by  a\ncomputer.  So he retyped in his earlier greeting.\n\nHello.   Again.\n\nIS THIS YOUR FIRST TIME?\n\nWhat a question! Scott answered quickly.\n\nPlease be gentle.\n\nNO . . .AT CHATTING ON COMPUTER . . .\n\nI call the computer at work.  First time with a stranger.  Is  it\nsafe?\n\nScott  had a gestalt realization.  This was fun.  He didn't  talk\nto the paper's computer.  He treated it as an electronic mailbox.\nBut this, there was an attractiveness to the anonymity behind the\ngame.   Even  if this Kirk was a flaming asshole, he  might  have\ndiscovered a new form of entertainment.\n\nVERY GOOD.  YOU'RE QUICK.\n\nNot too quick, sweetheart.\n\nIS THIS REALLY SCOTT MASON?\n\nYes.\n\nPROVE IT.\n\nKirk, or whoever this was, was comfortable with anonymity,  obvi-\nously.  And paranoid. Sure, play the game.\n\nYou screwed up the NASA launch.\n\nI DID NOT!!!!!!!!!!  OK, IT'S YOU.\n\nGlad to know it.\n\nYOU GOT IT ALL WRONG.\n\nWhat do I have wrong?\n\nABOUT HACKERS.  WE'RE NOT BAD.  ONLY A FEW BAD APPLES, JUST  LIKE\nCOPS AND REPORTERS.  I HOPE YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.\n\nYou called me, remember?\n\nSTILL, IT'S NOT LIKE YOU THINK.\n\nSure, I think.\n\nNO  NO  NO . . .HACKERS.  WE'RE BASICALLY A GOOD  LOT  WHO  ENJOY\nCOMPUTERS FOR COMPUTERS SAKE.\n\nThat's what I've been saying\n\nREALLY.  HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT A HACKER REALLY IS?\n\nA  guy who pokes his nose around where it's not wanted.  Like  in\nNASA computers.\n\nYEAH,  THAT'S WHAT THE PRESS SAYS AND SO THAT'S WHAT THE  COUNTRY\nTHINKS.  BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SO.\n\nSo, change my mind.\n\nLET  ME  GIVE YOU THE NAMES OF A FEW HACKERS.   BILL  GATES.   HE\nFOUNDED  MICROSOFT.   WORTH A COUPLE OF  BILLION.   MITCH  KAPOR.\nFOUNDED LOTUS.  STEVE WOZNIAK FOUNDED APPLE.  GET THE POINT?\n\nYou still haven't told me what you think a hacker is.\n\nA HACKER IS SOMEONE WHO HACKS WITH COMPUTERS.  SOMEONE WHO ENJOYS\nUSING  THEM, PROGRAMMING THEM, FIGURING OUT HOW THEY  WORK,  WHAT\nMAKES  THEM TICK.  PUSHING THEM TO THE LIMIT.   EXTRACTING  EVERY\nLAST  INCH OF POWER FROM THEM.  LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.   WHAT\nDO YOU CALL SOMEONE WHO PLAYS WITH AMATEUR RADIOS?\n\nA Ham.\n\nAND  WHAT DO YOU CALL SOMEONE WHO HAS A CALCULATOR IN  HIS  SHORT\nPOCKET WITH A DOZEN BALLPOINT PENS?\n\nIn my day it was a sliderule, and we called them propeller heads.\n\nTHAT  TRANSLATES.  GOOD.  AND WHAT DO YOU CALL SOMEONE WHO  FLIES\nAIRPLANES FOR FUN?\n\nA fly boy, space jockey.\n\nA CAR TINKERER?\n\nA grease monkey\n\nAND SOMEONE WHO JUMPS OUT OF PLANES?\n\nFucking crazy!!!!\n\nFAIR  ENOUGH.  BUT HERE'S THE POINT.  DIFFERENT STROKES FOR  DIF-\nFERENT  FOLKS.   AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT PEOPLE WHO  LIKE  TO\nPLAY  WITH COMPUTERS ARE CALLED HACKERS.  IT'S AN OLD  TERM  FROM\nTHE 60'S FROM THE COLLEGES, AND AT THAT TIME IT WASN'T  DEROGATO-\nRY.   IT DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS THAT IT  DOES\nTODAY THANKS TO YOU.  HACKERS ARE JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO PLAY\nWITH  COMPUTERS  INSTEAD  OF CARS, BOATS,  AIRPLANES,  SPORTS  OR\nWHATEVER.  THAT'S IT, PURE AND SIMPLE.\n\nOk,  let's  accept  that for now.  What about  those  stories  of\nhackers  running around inside of everybody else's computers  and\nmaking  computer viruses and all.  Morris and Chase were  hackers\nwho caused a bunch of damage.\n\nWHOA!  TWO SEPARATE ISSUES.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF HACKERS WHO DO\nGO PROBING AND LOOKING  AROUND  OTHER PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS.  AND  I\nAM PROUD TO ADMIT THAT I AM ONE OF THEM.\n\nWait  a minute.  You first say that hackers are the guys  in  the\nwhite hats and then you admit that you are one of those  criminal\ntypes who invades the privacy of others.\n\nTHERE  IS  A  BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOOKING  AROUND  A  COMPUTER\nREADING ITS FILES AND DESTROYING THEM.  I REMEMBER READING  ABOUT\nTHIS  GUY  WHO BROKE INTO PEOPLE'S HOUSES WHEN THEY WERE  OUT  OF\nTOWN.   HE  LIVED IN THEIR HOUSE UNTIL THEY CAME  BACK  AND  THEN\nLEFT.   HE USED THEIR FOOD, THEIR TV, THEIR SHOWER AND  ALL,  BUT\nNEVER STOLE ANYTHING OR DID ANY DAMAGE.  THAT'S KINDA WHAT  HACK-\nERS DO.\n\nWhy?  For the thrill?\n\nOH,  I  GUESS THAT MAY BE PART OF IT, BUT IT'S REALLY  MORE  THAN\nTHAT.  IT'S A THIRST, AT LEAST FOR ME, FOR KNOWLEDGE.\n\nThat's a line of crap.\n\nREALLY.  LET'S COMPARE.  LET'S SAY I WAS WORKING IN A GARAGE  AND\nI  WAS  CAR  ENTHUSIAST BUT I DIDN'T OWN AND  COULDN'T  AFFORD  A\nFERRARI.   SO,  DURING THE DAY WHEN MY CUSTOMERS ARE AT  WORK,  I\nTAKE  THEIR CARS OUT FOR A RIDE . . .AND I EVEN REPLACE THE  GAS.\nI  DO  IT FOR  THE THRILL OF THE RIDE, NOT FOR THE THRILL OF  THE\nCRIME.\n\nSo you admit hacking is a crime?\n\nNO  NO  NO NO.  AGREED, ENTERING SOME COMPUTERS IS  CONSIDERED  A\nCRIME  IN  SOME STATES, BUT IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, IF  YOU  LEAVE\nYOUR  COMPUTER PASSWORD TAPED TO THE BOTTOM OF YOUR  DESK  DRAWER\nYOU CAN GO TO JAIL.  I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.\n\nYou made that up.\n\nCHECK  IT  OUT.  I DON'T KNOW THE LEGAL JARGON,  BUT  IT'S  TRUE.\nTHE ISSUE IS, FOR THE GUY WHO DRIVES PEOPLE'S CARS WITHOUT  THEIR\nPERMISSION,  THAT  IS REALLY A CRIME.  I GUESS  A  GRAND  FELONY.\nRIGHT?   EVEN IF HE DOES NOTHING BUT DRIVE IT AROUND  THE  BLOCK.\nBUT WITH COMPUTERS IT'S DIFFERENT.\n\nHow is it different?\n\nFIRST THERE'S NO THEFT.\n\nWhat about theft of service?\n\nARGUABLE.\n\nBreaking and entering.\n\nNOT ACCORDING TO MY FRIEND. HIS FATHER IS A LAWYER.\n\nBut, you have to admit, you are doing it without permission.\n\nNO, NOT REALLY.\n\nAw, come on.\n\nLISTEN.  LET'S SAY THAT YOU LIVE IN A HOUSE.\n\nNice place to make a home.\n\nAND  LET'S  SAY THAT YOU AND YOUR NEIGHBORS DECIDE TO  LEAVE  THE\nKEYS  TO YOUR HOUSES ON THE CURB OF YOUR STREET EVERY DAY.   EVEN\nWHEN YOU'RE HOME.  SO THAT ANYONE WHO COMES ALONG CAN PICK UP THE\nKEYS AND WALK INTO YOUR HOUSE ANYTIME THEY WANT TO.\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nOF COURSE IT IS.  BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DID THAT AND  THEN\nYOUR HOUSE GOT BROKEN INTO AND YOU WERE ROBBED?\n\nI  guess  the police would figure me for a  blithering  idiot,  a\ncandidate for the funny farm, and my insurance company might have\nreason not to pay me after they canceled me.  So what?\n\nTHAT'S WHAT I DO.  AND THAT'S WHAT MY FRIENDS DO.  WE LOOK AROUND\nFOR PEOPLE WHO LEAVE THE KEYS TO THEIR COMPUTERS LYING AROUND FOR\nANYONE TO PICK UP.  WHEN WE FIND A SET OF KEYS, WE USE THEM.\n\nIt  can't be that simple.  No one would leave keys  lying  around\nfor hackers.\n\nWRONGO MEDIA BREATH.  IT'S ABSURDLY SIMPLE.  I DON'T KNOW OF VERY\nMANY COMPUTERS THAT I CAN'T GET INTO.  SOME PEOPLE CALL IT BREAK-\nING AND ENTERING. I CALL IT A WELCOME MAT.  IF YOU DON'T WANT  ME\nIN YOUR COMPUTER, THEN DON'T LEAVE THE FRONT DOOR OPEN.\n\nIf what you're saying is true . . .\n\nIT  IS.  COMPLETELY.  I HAVE THE KEYS TO  HUNDREDS  OF  COMPUTERS\nAROUND  THE  COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.  AND ONE WAY OR  ANOTHER  THE\nKEYS WERE ALL LEFT LYING IN THE STREET.  SO I USED THEM TO HAVE A\nLOOK AROUND.\n\nI  don't know if I buy this.  But, for now, I'll put that  aside.\nSo, where do these hacker horrors come from?\n\nAGAIN  LET'S  COMPARE.  IF YOU LEFT YOUR KEYS IN  FRONT  OF  YOUR\nHOUSE AND HALF OF YOUR TOWN KNEW IT AND 100 PEOPLE WENT INTO YOUR\nHOUSE TO LOOK AROUND, HOW MANY WOULD STAY HONEST AND JUST LOOK?\n\nNot many I guess.\n\nBUT  WITH HACKERS, THERE'S A CODE OF ETHICS THAT MOST OF US  LIVE\nBY.   BUT AS IN ANY GROUP OR SOCIETY THERE ARE A FEW  BAD  APPLES\nAND THEY GIVE THE REST OF  US A BAD NAME.  THEY GET A KICK OUT OF\nHURTING  OTHER PEOPLE, OR STEALING, OR WHATEVER.  HERE'S  ANOTHER\nSOMETHING  FOR YOUR FILE.  EVERY COMPUTER SYSTEM IN  THE  COUNTRY\nHAS BEEN ENTERED BY HACKERS.  EVERY SINGLE ONE.\n\nThat's impossible.\n\nTRY  ME.   I'VE BEEN INTO OVER A THOUSAND MYSELF  AND  THERE  ARE\nTHOUSANDS OF GUYS LIKE ME.  AT LEAST I'M HONEST.\n\nWhy should I believe that?\n\nWE'RE TALKING AREN'T WE.\n\nThrow me off the track.\n\nI COULD HAVE IGNORED YOU.  I'M UNTRACEABLE.\n\nBy the way, what's your name.\n\nCAPTAIN KIRK.\n\nNo, really.\n\nREALLY.  ON BBS THAT'S MY ONLY NAME.\n\nHow can I call you?\n\nYOU CAN'T.  WHAT'S YOUR HANDLE?\n\nHandle? Like CB?  Never had one.\n\nYOU NEED ONE DUDE.  WITHOUT IT YOU'RE A JUST A REPORTER NERD.\n\nBeen called worse.  How about Spook?  That's what I'm doing.\n\nCAN'T.  WE ALREADY GOT A SPOOK.  CAN'T HAVE TWO.  TRY AGAIN.\n\nWhat do you mean we?\n\nWE.   MY  GROUP.  YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD OF 401 AND CHAOS  AND  THE\nLEGION  OF DOOM.  WELL, I AM PART OF ANOTHER GROUP.  BUT I  CAN'T\nTELL YOU WHAT IT'S CALLED.  YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE INNER  CIRCLE.\nI KNOW WHAT I'LL CALL YOU.  REPO MAN.\n\nrepo man\n\nREPORTER MAN. SUSPICIOUS TOO.\n\nI  suspect that hackers are up to no good.\n\nOK,  SOME  ARE, BUT THEY'RE THE EXCEPTION.  HOW  MANY  MASS  GOOD\nSAMARITANS  OTHER THAN MOTHER TERESA DO YOU WRITE  ABOUT?   NONE.\nONLY IF THEY'RE KILLED IN ACTION.  BUT, MASS MURDERERS ARE  NEWS.\nSO  ALL YOU NEWS FIENDS MAKE HEADLINES ON DEATH AND  DESTRUCTION.\nTHE MEDIA SELLS THE HYPE AND YOU CAN'T DENY IT.\n\nGot me.  You're right, that's what the public buys.  But not  all\nnews is bad.\n\nEXACTLY.  SEE THE POINT?\n\nAt least we don't do the crime, just report it.  What about these\nviruses.  I suppose hackers are innocent of that too.\n\nBY AND LARGE YES.  PEOPLE THAT WRITE VIRUSES AND INFECT COMPUTERS\nARE THE COMPUTER EQUIVALENT TO SERIAL KILLERS.  OR HOW ABOUT  THE\nGUY  WITH AIDS, WHO KNOWS HE'S GOT IT AND SCREWS AS MANY   PEOPLE\nAS HE CAN TO SPREAD IT AROUND.  VIRUSES ARE DANGEROUS AND DEMENT-\nED.  NO HACKER OF THE CODE WOULD DO THAT.\n\nYou keep mentioning this code.  What is the code?\n\nIT'S A CODE OF ETHICS THAT MOST OF US LIVE BY.  AND IT'S  CRUCIAL\nTO  A STABLE UNDERGROUND CULTURE THAT SURVIVES BY ITS  WITS.   IT\nGOES LIKE THIS:  NEVER INTENTIONALLY DAMAGE ANOTHER COMPUTER.\n\nThat's it?\n\nPRETTY SIMPLE HUH?\n\nSo,  you said earlier that you poke around NASA  computers.   And\nNASA just had a pretty good glitch that rings of hackers.   Some-\none broke the code.\n\nEXACTLY.  BUT NO ONE'S TAKING CREDIT.\n\nWhy  would  they?  Isn't that a sure giveaway and a trip  up  the\nriver?\n\nYES AND NO.  MORRIS FOR EXAMPLE ADMITTED HIS MISTAKE.  HE SAID HE\nWAS  WRITING A VIRUS FOR THE EXERCISE AND IT GOT OUT OF  CONTROL.\nOOPS, HE SAID, AND I'M INCLINED TO BELIEVE  HIM BECAUSE HE DIDN'T\nCOVER HIS TRACKS.  IF HE WAS SERIOUS ABOUT SHUTTING DOWN INTERNET\nHE  WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN FOUND AND HE WOULDN'T HAVE ADMITTED IT  IF\nTHEY EVER CAUGHT HIM.  PROVING HE DID IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nSo?\n\nSO, HACKERS HAVE STRONG EGOS.  THEY LIKE TO GET CREDIT FOR  FIND-\nING THE KEYS TO COMPUTERS.  IT BUILDS THEM A REPUTATION THAT THEY\nFEED ON. VIRUS BUILDERS ARE THE SAME.  IF SOMEONE BUILDS A  VIRUS\nAND THEN FEEDS IT INTO THE SYSTEM, HE WANTS TO GET CREDIT FOR IT.\nSO HE TAKES CREDIT.\n\nAnd then gets caught, right?\n\nWRONGO AGAIN,  LET'S SAY I TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS ME THAT DID  THAT\nSTUFF AT NASA.\n\nSo it was you?\n\nNO NO.  I SAID, IF IT WAS ME, WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT IT?\n\nUh . . .\n\nWHAT?\n\nI'm thinking.\n\nWHO WOULD YOU TELL?\n\nThe police, NASA,\n\nWHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM?\n\nThat you did it.\n\nWHO AM I?\n\nGood point.  Who are you?\n\nI DIDN'T DO IT AND I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHO I AM.  YOU  SEE,\nMOST OF US DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER THAN OVER THE COMPUTER.  IT JUST\nDON'T MATTER WHO I AM.\n\nI don't know if I buy everything you say, but it is something  to\nthink about.  So what about the NASA thing.\n\nI DON'T KNOW.  NOBODY DOES.\n\nYou mean, I gather, nobody has owned up to it.\n\nEXACTLY\n\nHow can I describe you?  If I wanted to use you in an article.\n\nSTUDENT AT A MAJOR UNIVERSITY.\n\nSounds like a Letter to Penthouse Forum.\n\nTRY THE SEX BBS.\n\nIf you've done nothing wrong, why not come forward?\n\nNOT  EVERYONE BELIEVES WHAT WE DO IS HARMLESS.  NEITHER  DO  YOU.\nYET. MIGHT BE BAD FOR MY HEALTH.\n\nWhat time is  it?\n\nWON'T  WORK GUY. TIME ZONES I UNDERSTAND.  ONE THING.  IF  YOU'RE\nINTERESTED,  I  CAN ARRANGE A TRIP THOUGH THE  FIRST  TRUST  BANK\nCOMPUTERS,\n\nArrange a trip?  Travel agent on the side.\n\nIN  A  WAY WE ARE ALL TRAVEL AGENTS.  JUST THOUGHT YOU  MIGHT  BE\nINTERESTED.\n\nLet's say I am.\n\nJUST CALL 212-555-9796.  USE THE PASSWORD MONEYMAN AND THE ID  IS\n9796.  LOOK AROUND ALL YOU WANT.  USE F1 FOR HELP.  I'LL CALL YOU\nIN A COUPLE  OF DAYS.  LEAVE YOUR COMPUTER ON.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                    Chapter 13\n\n     Wednesday,  November 25\n\n     HACKERS HAMPER HOLIDAY HELLO'S\n     By Scott Mason\n\nAs  most of my readers know by now, I have an inherent  suspicion\nof  lame excuses for bureaucratic bungling.  If any of  you  were\nunable to make a long distance phone call yesterday, you  weren't\nalone.\n\nAT&T, the long distance carrier that provides the best  telephone\nservice  in  the world, handles in excess  of  100,000,000  calls\ndaily.   Yesterday, less than 25% got through.  Why?   There  are\ntwo  possible  answers:  AT&T's official  response  and  another,\nequally  plausible and certainly more sinister reason  that  many\nexperts claim to be the real culprit.\n\nAccording  to  an AT&T spokesperson from its Basking  Ridge,  New\nJersey  office,  \"In  my 20 years with AT&T, I have  not  seen  a\ncrisis  so dramatic that it nearly shut down  operations  nation-\nwide.\"   According  to insiders, AT&T came close to  declaring  a\nnational emergency and asking for Federal assistance.\n\nAirlines  and  hotel  reservation services  reported  that  phone\ntraffic was down between 65-90%! Telemarketing organizations said\nthat sales were off by over 80%.\n\nPerhaps  an understanding of what goes on behind the scenes of  a\nphone call is in order.\n\nWhen you pick up your phone, you hear a dial tone that is provid-\ned  by the Local Exchange Company, or as more commonly called,  a\nBaby Bell.  The LEC handles all local calls within certain  dial-\ning  ranges.  A long distance call is switched by the LEC to  the\n4ESS, a miracle of modern communications.  There are 114 Number 4\nand 5 Electronic Switching Systems used in all major AT&T switch-\ning  offices  across the country. (A few rural  areas  still  use\nrelays and mechanical switches over 40 years old.  When it rains,\nthe relays get sticky and so does the call.)\n\nNow  here's the invisible beauty.  There are 14  direct  connects\nbetween each of the 114 4ESS's and every other 4ESS, each capable\nof handling thousands of call at once. So, rarely do we ever  get\na  long distance busy signal.  The systems automatically  reroute\nthemselves.\n\nThe 4ESS then calls its own STP, Signal Transfer Point within  an\nSS7 network.  The SS7 network determines from which phone  number\nthe call originated and its destination. (More about that later!)\nIt sends out an  IAM, Initial Address Message, to the destination\n4ESS switch and determines if a line is available to complete the\ncall.   The  SS7 is so powerful it can actually create  up  to  7\nadditional virtual paths for the heaviest traffic.  800  numbers,\nDial  a Porn 900 numbers and other specially coded phone  numbers\nare translated through the NCP( Network Control Point) and routed\nseparately.  Whew! Had enough?  So have I.\n\n\nThe  point is, massive computer switches all across  our  nations\nautomatically  select  the routing for each call.   A  call  from\nMiami  to  New York could be sent through 4ESS's in  Dallas,  Los\nAngeles  and  Chicago before reaching its  ultimate  destination.\nBut what happened yesterday?\n\nIt seems that the switches got real stupid and slowed down.   For\nthose  readers who recall the Internet Worm in November  of  1988\nand  the  phone system slowdown in early 1990 and then  again  in\n1991, computers can be infected with errors, either  accidentally\nor otherwise, and forced to misbehave.\n\nAT&T's explanation is not satisfying for those who remember  that\nAT&T had said, \"it can never happen again.\"\n\nToday's official explanation is; \"A minor hardware problem in one\nof  our New York City 4ESS switches caused a cascading of similar\nhardware failures throughout the network.  From all  appearances,\na  faulty piece of software in the SS7 networks was the  culprit.\nOur  engineers  are studying the problem and  expect  a  solution\nshortly.   We are sorry for any inconvenience to our valued  cus-\ntomers.\"\n\nI agree with AT&T on one aspect: it was a software problem.\n\nAccording  to well placed sources who asked to remain  anonymous,\nthe  software problems were intentionally introduced into  AT&T's\nlong  distance computers, by person or persons yet to be  identi-\nfied.  They went on to say that internal investigation teams have\nbeen  assigned to find out who and how the \"bug\" was  introduced.\nRegardless of the outcome of the investigation, AT&T is expected,\nthey  say,  to maintain the cover of a hardware  failure  at  the\nrequest of the public relations Vice President.\n\nAT&T  did,  to their credit, get long distance  services  up  and\nrunning at 11:30 P.M. last night, only 9 hours after the  problem\nfirst  showed up.  They re-installed  an older SS7 software  ver-\nsion that is widely known to contain some \"operational anomalies\"\naccording  to  the company; but they still feel that it  is  more\nreliable than what is currently in use.\n\nIf,  in  fact the biggest busy signal in history  was  caused  by\nintruders  into the world's largest communications systems,  then\nwe  need to ask ourselves a few questions.  Was yesterday a  sym-\nbolic  choice of dates for disaster or mere  coincidence?   Would\nthe damage have been greater on a busier business day?  Could  it\naffect our defense systems and the government's ability to commu-\nnicate  in case of emergency?  How did someone,  or  some  group,\nget  into AT&T's computers and effect an entire nation's  ability\nto  do  business?   And then, was there  a  political  motivation\nsufficient to justify am attack om AT&T and not on Sprint or MCI?\n\nPerhaps  the most salient question we all are  asking  ourselves,\nis, When will it happen again?\n\nThis is Scott Mason, busy, busy, busy.  Tomorrow; is Big  Brother\nlistening?\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday, November 27\n     Times Square, New York\n\nThe  pre-winter overnight snow-storm in New York City  turned  to\nsleet  and ice as the temperature dropped.  That didn't stop  the\ntraffic though.  Hundreds of thousands of cars still crawled into\nManhattan  to  insure  downtown gridlock.  If  the  streets  were\ndrivable, the city wouldn't stop. Not for a mere ice storm.\n\nSteam  poured from subway grates and manhole covers as rush  hour\npedestrians  huddled  from the cold winds, tromping  through  the\ngrimy snow on the streets and sidewalks.\n\nThe  traffic  on  42nd street was at a near  standstill  and  the\nintersection  at Broadway and 7th Avenues where the Dow  Chemical\nBuilding  stood was unusually bad.  Taxis and busses  and  trucks\nand cars all fought for space to move.\n\nAs  the  southbound light on 7th turned green, a dark  blue  Ford\nEconoline  van screeched forward and cut off two taxis to make  a\nhighly illegal left turn.  It curved too quickly and too  sharply\nfor  the dangerously icy conditions and began to slide  sideways.\nThe driver turned the wheel hard to the left, against the  slide,\ncompensating  in the wrong direction and then he slammed  on  the\nbrakes.   The van continued to slide to the right as it  careened\ntoward the sidewalk. The van rotated and headed backwards at  the\nthrongs  of  pedestrians.  They didn't notice until  it  was  too\nlate.\n\nThe van spun around again and crashed through a McDonald's window\ninto  the dense breakfast crowds.  As it crushed several  patrons\ninto the counter, the van stopped, suddenly propelling the driver\nthrough the windshield into the side of the  yogurt machine.  His\nneck was broken instantly.\n\nGetting  emergency vehicles to Times Square during the A.M.  rush\nhour  is  in  itself a lesson in futility.  Given  that  17  were\npronounced dead on the scene and another 50 or more were injured,\nthe task this Monday morning was damned near impossible.\n\nCity-ites come together in a crisis, and until enough  paramedics\narrived, people from all walks of life  tended to the wounded and\nrespectfully  covered those beyond help.  Executives in  3  piece\nsuits  worked with 7th avenue delivery boys in  harmony.   Secre-\ntaries  lay their expensive furs on the slushy street as  pallets\nfor the victims.\n\nIt was over two hours before all the wounded were transferred  to\nlocal  hospitals and the morgue was close to finishing its  clean\nup  efforts.  Lt. Mel Kavitz, 53rd. Precinct, Midtown South  NYPD\nmade it to the scene as the more grisly pieces were put away.  He\nspoke  to a couple of officers who had interviewed witnesses  and\nsurvivors.   The  media were already there adding to  the  frigid\nchaos.   Two of the local New York TV stations were  broadcasting\nlive,  searching out sound-bytes for the evening news and  all  3\ndailies  had reporters looking for quotable quotes.  Out  of  the\nnecessity  created  by such disasters, the police  had  developed\nimmunity to the media circus.\n\n\"That's  it lieutenant.  Seems the van made a screwball turn  and\nlost  control.\"   The young clean-shaven patrolman  shrugged  his\nshoulders.  Only 27, he had still been on the streets long enough\nnot to let much bother him.\n\n\"Who's the driver?\"  Lt. Kavitz scanned the scene.\n\n\"It's a foreign national, one . . .ah . . .Jesef Mumballa. Second\nyear engineering student at Columbia.\"  The young cop looked down\nand spoke quietly. \"He didn't make it.\"\n\n\"I'm  not surprised.  Look at this mess.\" The Lieutenant took  it\nin  stride. \"Just what McDonalds needs.  Another  massacre.  Any-\nthing on him?\"  Kavitz asked half suspecting, half hoping.\n\n\"Clean. As clean as rag head can be.\"\n\n\"Ok, that's enough. What about the van?\"\n\n\"The van?\"\n\n\"The  van!\"  Kavitz said pointedly at the  patrolman.  \"The  van!\nWhat's in it? Has anybody looked?\"\n\n\"Uh  . . .no sir.  We've been working with the injured .  .  .I'm\nsure you . . .\"\n\n\"Of course.  I'm sorry.\" Kavitz waved off the explanation.  \"Must\nhave  been  pretty rough.\" He looked around and shook  his  head.\n\"Anything else officer?\"\n\n\"No  sir,  that's about it.  We still don't have an  exact  count\nthough.\"\n\n\"It'll  come soon enough.  Soon enough.\"  Kavitz left  the  young\npatrolman  and  walked into the bloodbath, pausing  only  briefly\nbefore opening the driver's side door. \"Let's see what's in  this\nthing.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"D'y'hear  about the mess over at Times Square?\"  Ben  Shellhorne\nwalked up to Scott Mason's desk at the City Times.\n\n\"Yeah,  pretty  gruesome.   The Exchange .  .  .McDonald's.   You\nreally  scrape the bottom, don't you?\"  Scott grinned  devilishly\nat Ben.\n\n\"Maybe some guys do, not me.\"  Ben sat down next to Scott's desk.\n\"But that's not the point. There's something else.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"  Scott turned to Ben.\n\n\"The van.\"\n\n\"The van?\" Scott asked.\n\n\"Yeah, the van.  The van that busted up the McBreakfast crowd.\"\n\n\"What about it?\"\n\nBen hurried. \"Well, it was some sort of high tech lab on  wheels.\nComputers and radios and stuff.  Pretty wild.\"\n\n\"Why's  that so unusual?  Phone company, computer  repair  place,\nEPA monitors, could be anything.\" Scott seemed disinterested.\n\n\"If  that were true, you're right.  But this was a  private  van,\nand there's no indication of what company it worked for. And  the\ndriver's  dead.   Personal ID only.  No company, no  numbers,  no\nnothing, except this.\"\n\nHe  handed  a  sheaf  of  computer  printouts  to  Scott.   \"Look\nfamiliar?\"\n\nScott took the papers and perused them.  They were the same  kind\nthat Scott had received from Vito, his unknown donor. These  were\nnew  documents as far as Scott could tell - he  didn't  recognize\nthem as part of his library.  They only contained some stock tips\nand  insider trading information from a leading Wall Street  bro-\nkerage house. Pretty tame stuff.\n\n\"These,\" Scott pointed at the papers, \"these were in the van?\"\n\n\"That's what I said,\"  Ben said triumphantly.\n\n\"How did you get them?\" Scott pushed.\n\n\"I have a few friends on the force and, well, this is my beat you\nknow.  Crime, disaster, murder, violence, crisis, death  and  de-\nstruction on the streets. Good promo stuff for the Big Apple.\"\n\n\"Are there any more?\" Scott ignored Ben's self pity.\n\n\"My  guy  said there were so many that a few  wouldn't  make  any\ndifference.\"\n\n\"Holy Christ!\" Scott said aloud as he sat back in thought.\n\n\"What is it? Scott?  Does this mean something?\"\n\n\"Can I have these, Ben?  Do you need them?\"\n\n\"Nah!  There's  no  blood on 'em?  Not my kinda  story.   I  just\nremembered  that secret papers and computers are your  thing,  so\nthey're yours.\"  Ben stood up. \"Just remember, next time you hear\nabout a serial killer, it's mine.\"\n\n\"Deal.  And, hey, thanks a lot.  Drinks on me.\"  Scott caught Ben\nbefore he left. \"Ben, one more thing.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"  Ben stopped.\n\n\"Can  you  get  me into that van.  Just to look  around?  Not  to\ntouch, just to look?\"  Scott would have given himself a vasectomy\nwith a weed eater to have a look.  This was his first solid  lead\non  the source of the mysterious and valuable documents  that  he\nhad  stymied  him  for so long.  He had been  unable  to  publish\nanything  significant  due to lack of confirming  evidence.   Any\nlead was good lead, he thought.\n\n\"It may cost another favor, but  sure what the fuck.  I'll set it\nup.   Call  you.\"  Ben waved as he walked off  leaving  Scott  to\nponder the latest developments.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe  interior of the dark blue Ford Econoline van was not in  bad\nshape  since the equipment was bolted into place.   The  exterior\nthough  was  thoroughly trashed, with too many blood  stains  for\nScott  to stomach.  It was a bad wreak, even for the  Police  Im-\npound.\n\nWhile  Ben kept his cooperative keeper of the peace occupied,  he\nsignaled  to Scott that he would only have a minute,  so  please,\nmake it quick.\n\nScott  entered the van with all his senses peaked.  He wanted  to\ntake  mental pictures and get as much detail as he  could.   Both\nsides  of  the  van contained steel shelving, with  an  array  of\nequipment  bolted firmly in place.  It was an odd  assortment  of\nelectronics, noticed Scott.  There were 2 IBM personal  computers\nwith  large WYSIWYG monitors. What You See Is What You Get  moni-\ntors were generally used for intensive word processing or desktop\npublishing.  In a van? Odd.\n\nA digital oscilloscope and waveform monitor were stacked over one\nof the computers.  Test equipment and no hand tools?  No  answer.\nOver  the other computer sat a small black and  white  television\nand a larger color television monitor.  Two cellular phones  were\nmounted  behind the drivers seat.  Strange combination.  Then  he\nnoticed what appeared to be a miniature satellite dish, only 8 or\nso  inches across.  He recognized it as a  parabolic  microphone.\nAha!  That's  it.  Some sort  of spy type  surveillance  vehicle.\nTracking  drug dealers and assorted low lifes.  But, a  privately\nregistered vehicle, no sign of any official affiliations to known\nenforcement agencies?\n\nScott felt his minute was gone in a only few seconds.\n\n\"Well,  you find what you're looking for?\" Ben asked Scott  after\nthey  had left the police garage grounds overlooking  the  Hudson\nRiver.\n\nScott  looked puzzled. \"It's more like by not finding anything  I\neliminated what it's not.\"\n\nBen  scowled. \"Hey riddle man, back to earth.  Was it a waste  or\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Far from it.\" Scott's far away glaze disappeared as his personal\nEureka! set in.  \"I think I may have stumbled, sorry, you,  stum-\nbled  onto to something that will begin to put several pieces  in\nplace  for  me. And if I'm right, even a little bit  right,  holy\nshit.  I mean, hoooolly shit.\"\n\n\"Clue  me  in, man.  What's the skinny. You got  Pulitzer  eyes.\"\nBen tried to keep up with Scott as their pace quickened.\n\n\"I gotta make one phone call, for a confirmation.  And, if it's a\nyes, then I got, I mean we got one fuckuva story.\"\n\n\"No, it's yours man, yours.  Just let me keep the blood and guts.\nBesides,  I don't even know what you're talking about, you  ain't\nsaid shit.  Keep it.  Just keep your promise on the drinks. Ok?\"\n\nScott arrived at Grand Central as the huge clock oppose the giant\nKodak  photograph  struck four o'clock.  He  proceeded  to  track\ntwenty two where the four-thirteen to Scarsdale and White  Plains\nwas  waiting.   He walked down to the third car and took  a  seat\nthat would only hold two.  He was saving it for Ty.\n\nTyrone Duncan hopped on the crowded train seconds before it  left\nthe station.  He dashed down the aisle of the crowded car.  There\nwas  only one empty seat.  Next to Scott Mason.   Scott's  rushed\ncall  gave Ty an excuse to leave work early.  It had been one  of\nthose days.  Ty collapsed in a sweat on the seat next to Scott.\n\n\"Didn't  your  mother  tell you it's not polite  to  keep  people\nwaiting?\" Scott made fun of Tyrone.\n\n\"Didn't your mama tell you not to irritate crazy overworked black\ndudes who carry a gun?\"\n\nScott  took  the  hint.  It was safest to  ignore  Ty's  diatribe\ncompletely.  \"I think I got it figured out.  Thought you might be\ninterested.\"  Scott teased Duncan.\n\nTyrone  turned his head away from Scott.  \"If you do,  I'll  kiss\nyour  bare  ass on Broadway.  We don't have  shit.\"   He  sounded\ndisgusted with the performance of his bureau.\n\nScott  puffed  up a bit before answering.  The pride did  not  go\nunnoticed by Duncan.  \"I figured out how these guys, these black-\nmailers, whoever they are, get their information.\"  Scott  paused\nfor effect which was not lost on Duncan.\n\n\"I don't care anymore.  I've been pulled from the case,\"   Tyrone\nsaid sounding exhausted.\n\n\"Well,\" Scott smirked.  \"I think you just might care, anyway.\"\n\nTyrone  felt himself Scott putting him into a trap.   \"What  have\nyou got?\"\n\nScott relished the moment.  The answer was so simple.  He saw the\nanticipation  in Tyrone's face, but they had become  friends  and\ndidn't feel right about prolonging the tension. \"Van Eck.\"\n\nDuncan  was expecting more than a two word answer that was  abso-\nlutely  meaningless  to him.  \"What?  What is Van Eck?   The  ex-\npressway?\"  He said referring to the New York Expressway that had\nbeen  a  14 mile line traffic jam since it opened some  40  years\nago.\n\n\"Not Van Wyck, Van Eck.  Van Eck Radiation.  That's how they  get\nthe information.\"\n\nDuncan was no engineer, and he knew that Scott was proficient  in\nthe discipline.  He was sure he had an education coming.  \"For us\nfeeble  minded  simpletons, would you mind  explaining?   I  know\nabout Van Allen radiation belts, nuclear radiation . . .but ok, I\ngive.  What's this Van Eck?\"\n\nScott had not meant to humble Tyrone that much.  \"Sorry.  It's  a\npretty  arcane branch of engineering, even for techy types.   How\nmuch do you know about computers? Electronics?\"\n\n\"Enough to get into trouble.  I can wire a stereo and I know  how\nto  use the computers at the Bureau, but that's about it.   Never\nbothered to get inside those monsters.  Consider me an idiot.\"\n\n\"Never,  just  a novice.  It's lecture time.  Computers,  I  mean\nPC's,  the kind on your desk and at home are electronic  devices,\nthat's  no  great revelation.  As you may know, radio  waves  are\ncaused  by the motion of electrons, current, down a  wire.   Ever\nheard or seen interference on your TV?\"\n\n\"Sure.  We've been down this road before, with your EMP-T bombs.\"\nTyrone  cringed at the lecture he had received on secret  defense\nprojects.\n\n\"Exactly.   Interference  is caused by other  electrical  devices\nthat  are running near the radio or TV.  Essentially,  everything\nthat runs on electricity emanates a field of energy, an  electro-\nmagnetic field.  Well, in TV and radio, an antenna is stuck up in\nthe air to pick up or 'hear' the radio waves.  You simply tune it\nin to the frequency you want to listen to.\"\n\n\"I know, like on my car radio.  Those are preset, though.\"\n\n\"Doesn't  matter.   They  still pick the frequency  you  want  to\nlisten to.  Can you just hold that thought and accept it at  face\nvalue?\"   Scott followed his old teaching techniques.  He  wanted\nto  make  sure that each and every step of  his  explanation  was\nclearly understood  before going on to the next.  Tyrone acknowl-\nedged  that  while he wasn't an electronic  engineer,  he  wasn't\nstupid either.\n\n\"Good.  Well computers are the same.  They radiate an electromag-\nnetic  field  when  they're in use.  If the  power  is  off  then\nthere's  no  radiation.  Inside the computer there  are  so  many\nradiated  fields  that it looks like garbage, pure  noise  to  an\nantenna.  Filtering out the information is a bitch. But, you  can\neasily tune into a monitor.\"\n\n\"Monitors.  You mean computer screens?\"  Tyrone wanted to clarify\nhis understanding.\n\n\"Monitors,  CRT's, screens, cathode ray tubes, whatever you  want\nto  call them.  The inside of most monitors is just like  televi-\nsion sets.  There is an electron beam that writes to the  surface\nof  the screen, the phosphor coated one.  That's what  makes  the\npicture.\"\n\n\"That's how a TV works? I always wondered.\" Duncan was only  half\nkidding.\n\n\"So,  the phosphor coating gets hit with a strong electron  beam,\nfull  of high voltage energy, and the phosphor glows, just for  a\nfew  milliseconds.  Then, the beam comes around again and  either\nturns it on or leaves it off, depending upon what the picture  is\nsupposed to show.  Make sense?\"\n\n\"That's why you can go frame to frame on a VCR, isn't it?   Every\nsecond there are actually lots of still pictures  that change  so\nquickly  that the eye is fooled into thinking it's  watching  mo-\ntion.   Really,  it's a whole set of photographed  being  flipped\nthrough  quickly.\"  Duncan picked up the essentials on the  first\npass.  Scott was visibly impressed.\n\n\"Bingo! So this beam is directed around the surface of the screen\nabout 60 times every second.\"\n\n\"What moves the beam?\"  Duncan was following closely.\n\n\"You are one perceptive pain in the butt, aren't you?  You nailed\nit  right on the head.\"  Scott enjoyed working with  bright  stu-\ndents.  Duncan's smile made his pudgy face appear larger than  it\nwas.   \"Inside the monitor are what is called  deflection  coils.\nDeflection  coils are magnets that tell the beam where to  strike\nthe  screen's  surface.  One magnet moves the  beam  horizontally\nacross  the screen from left to right, and the other magnet,  the\nvertical  one, moves the beam  from the top to the bottom.   Same\nway as in a TV.\"  Scott paused for a moment.  He had given  simi-\nlar  descriptions before, and he found it useful to let is  audi-\nence have time to create a mental image.\n\n\"Sure, that makes sense.  So what about this radiation?\"   Duncan\nimpatiently asked. He wanted to understand the full picture.\n\n\"Well,  magnets concentrate lots of electrical energy in a  small\nplace, so they create more intense, or stronger magnetic  fields.\nElectromagnetic radiation if you will.  In this case, the  radia-\ntion  from a computer monitor is called Van Eck radiation,  named\nafter the Dutch electrical engineer who described the phenomena.\"\nScott sounded pleased with his Radiation 101 course brief.\n\nTyrone  wasn't satisfied though.  \"So how does that  explain  the\nblackmail and the infamous papers you have?  And why do I care? I\ndon't get it.\"  The confused look on Tyrone's face told Scott  he\nhadn't successfully tutored his FBI friend.\n\n\"It's  just like a radio station.  A computer monitor puts out  a\ndistinctive  pattern  of  radio waves from the  coils  and  pixel\nradiations from the screen itself, at a comparatively high power.\nSo, with a little radio tuner, you can pick up the signals on the\ncomputer screen and read them for yourself.  It's the  equivalent\nof eavesdropping on a computer.\"\n\nThe stunned grimace on Duncan's face was all Scott needed to  see\nto realize that he now had communicated the gist of the technolo-\ngy to him.\n\n\"Are  you  telling me,\" Tyrone searched for the words  and  spoke\nslowly,  \"that a computer broadcasts what's going on  inside  it?\nThat anyone can read anyone else's computer?\"\n\n\"In a sense yes.\"\n\nTyrone looked out the window as they passed through Yonkers,  New\nYork.  He whistled quietly to himself.\n\n\"How  did  you  find out?  Where did you . .  .?\"  The  questions\nspewed forth.\n\n\"There  was a wreak, midtown, and there was a bunch of  equipment\nin  it.   Then I checked it out with a couple of  .  .  .engineer\nfriends who are more up on this than I am.  They confirmed it.\"\n\n\"This  stuff was in a van?  How far away does this  stuff  work?\"\nDuncan gave away his concern.\n\n\"According  to  my sources, with the proper gear,  two  or  three\nmiles  is  not unreasonable.  In New York, maybe only  a  half  a\nmile.  Interference and steel buildings and all.  Manhattan is  a\nmagnetic sewer, as they say.\"\n\n\"Shit,  this could explain a lot.\" The confident persona  of  the\nFBI  professional returned.  \"The marks all claim that there  was\nno way for the information to get out, yet it did.  Scott, is  it\npossible that . . .how could one person get all this stuff?  From\nso  many  companies?\"  The pointed question was  one  of  devil's\nadvocacy.\n\n\"That's  the scary part, if I'm right.  But this is where I  need\nyour  help.\"  Scott had given his part, now to complete the  tale\nhe  needed the cooperation of his friend.  The story was  improv-\ning.\n\n\"Jesus,\"  Duncan said quietly contemplating the implications.\n\n\"Most  people believe that their computers are private.  If  they\nknew  that their inner most secrets were really  being  broadcast\nfor  anyone  to hear, it might change their behavior  a  little.\"\nScott had had the time to think about the impact if this was made\npublic.\n\n\"No shit Sherlock.  It makes me wonder who's been listening in on\nour computers all these years.  Maybe that's why our jobs seem to\nget  tougher  every day.\"  Duncan snapped himself back  from  the\nmental digression.  \"Where do you go from here?\"\n\nScott  was prepared.  He had a final bombshell to lay  on  Duncan\nbefore specifying his request. \"There are a couple of things that\nmake  me think.  First, there is no way that only one  guy  could\nput  together the amount of information that I have.   I've  told\nyou how much there is.  From all over the country.  That suggests\na  lot  more than one person  involved.  I don't know  how  many,\nthat's your job.\n\n\"Two, these blackmail threats.  Obviously whoever is reading  the\ncomputers,  Van Ecking them is what I call it, has  been  sending\nthe  information  to someone else.  Then they, in turn,  call  up\ntheir targets and let them know that their secrets are no  longer\nso  secret.   Then  three, they have been  probably  sending  the\ninformation to other people, on paper.  Like me and the  National\nExpose.   I  have  no idea if any others  are  receiving  similar\npackages.   What  I see here, is a coordinated effort to .  .  .\"\nScott held Tyrone's complete attention.\n\n\"You  still haven't told me what you need. Lay it on  me,  buddy.\nThere can't be much more.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it make sense that if we had one van, and the  equipment\ninside, we could trace it down, and maybe see if there really are\nother  Van  Eck  vans out there?  For an  operation  that's  this\nlarge,  there  would have to be a back up, a contingency .  .  .\"\nThe excitement oozed from Scott as his voice got louder.\n\n\"Shhhh . . .\" Tyrone cautioned.  \"The trains have ears.  I  don't\ngo for conspiracy theories, I never have.  Right now all we  have\nis raw, uncorrelated data.  No proof.  Just circumstantial events\nthat may have nothing to do with each other . . .\"\n\n\"Bullshit.   Look  at this.\"  Scott opened up his  briefcase  and\nhanded a file folder to Tyrone.\n\n\"What  is  it?  Looks like a news story, that . . .uh  .  .  .you\nwrote  and, it's about some mergers.  Big deal.\"   Duncan  closed\nthe folder.  \"What does this have to do with anything?\"\n\n\"This.   Yes, I wrote the story.  Two  days ago.  It hasn't  been\nprinted yet.\"  Scott took the folder back.  \"I found this copy in\nthe van that was wrecked two days ago.  It was Van Eck'ed from my\ncomputer  the  day I wrote it.  They've been watching me  and  my\ncomputer.\"\n\n\"Now  wait a second.  There are a hundred possible answers.   You\ncould have lost a copy or someone got  it from your wastebasket.\"\nDuncan  wasn't convincing either to himself or to  Scott.   Scott\nsmirked as Tyrone tried to justify the unbelievable.\n\n\"You want to play?\"  Scott asked.\n\n\"I think I'd better.  If this is for real,  no one has any priva-\ncy anymore.\"\n\n\"I know I don't.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 14\n\n     Sunday, November 29\n     Columbia University, New York\n\nThe  New York City Times had put the story on the 7th  page.   In\ncontrast,  the New York Post, in Murdoch's infinite  wisdom,  had\nput  pictures of the dead and dying on the front page.  With  the\nMcDonalds' window prominent.\n\nAhmed Shah reacted with pure intellectual detachment to the deba-\ncle  on Seventh Avenue and 42nd Street.  Jesef was a  martyr,  as\nmuch of one as those who had sacrificed their lives in the  Great\nWar  against Iraq.  He had to make a report.  From his  home,  in\nthe Spanish Harlem district of the upper West Side of  Manhattan,\n3 blocks from his Columbia University office, he wheeled over  to\nhis computer that was always on.\n\nC:\\cd protalk\nC:\\PROTALK\\protalk\n\nHe dialed a local New York number that was stored in the  Protalk\ncommunications program.  He had it set for 7 bits, no parity,  no\nstop bits.\n\n     <<<<<<DIALING>>>>>>\n\nThe  local  phone  number he dialed  answered  automatically  and\nredialed  another  number, and then that one dialed  yet  another\nnumber  before a message was relayed back to Ahmed Shah.  He  was\naccustomed to the delay.  While waiting he lit up a Marlboro.  It\nwas the only American cigarette that came close to the vile taste\nof Turkish camel shit cigarettes that he had smoked before coming\nto  the  United States. A few seconds later, the screen  came  to\nlife and displayed\n\n     PASSWORD:\n\nAhmed entered his password and his PRG response.\n\n     CRYPT KEY:\n\nHe chose a random crypt key that would  be used to guarantee  the\nprivacy of his conversations.\n\n     <<<<<<TRANSMISSION ENCODED>>>>>>\n\nThat  told Ahmed to begin his message, and that someone would  be\nthere to answer.\n\nGood Morning.

He died in a\ncar crash.\n\nWILL THIS HURT US?\n\nNo.  In New York we have another 11 readers.   But\nwe have lost one vehicle.  The police must have it.\n\nTHAT IS NOT GOOD.

It  caused,  however,  a\ndeluge  of paperwork for the Sergeant whose job it was  to  guard\nthe  confiscated  vehicles.  Most of those cars  damaged  in  the\nfirestorm had been towed for parking infractions.  It would  cost\nthe city tens of thousands of dollars, but not at least for three\nor four months. The city would take as long as possible to  proc-\ness the claims. Jesef Mumballa's vehicle was completely destroyed\nas  per Homosoto's order. The explosion that had caused the  fire\nwas identified as coming from his van, but little importance  was\nplaced with that obscure fact.\n\nBen  Shellhorne noticed, though.  Wasn't that the van that  Scott\nMason had shown such interest in yesterday?  A car bombing,  even\nif  on police property was not a particularly interesting  story,\nat  least in New York.  But Ben wanted the drink that  Scott  had\npromised.  Maybe he could parlay it into two.\n\n\"Scott,  remember  that van?\"  Ben called Scott on  the  internal\noffice phones.\n\n\"Yeah, what about it?\"\n\n\"It's gone.\"\n\n\"What do you mean gone?\"\n\n\"Somebody blew it up.  Took half the cars in the impound with it.\nSounds like Cemex.  Just thought you might care.  You were pretty\nhot  about  seeing it .\"  Scott enjoyed  Ben's  nonchalance.   He\ndecided to play it cool.\n\n\"Yeah,  thanks  for the call. Looks like another  lead  down  the\ntubes.\"\n\n\"Know whatcha mean.\"\n\nScott called Tyrone at his office.\n\n\"4543.\"  Duncan answered obliquely.\n\n\"Just an anonymous call.\"  Scott didn't disguise his voice.   The\nmessage would be obvious.\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"A  certain  van in a certain police impound was just  blown  up.\nSeemed  le  Plastique was involved.  Thought you  might  want  to\nknow.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"  The phone went dead.\n\nWithin  30  minutes, 6 FBI agents arrived at the  police  impound\nstation.  It looked like a war zone.  Vehicles were strewn about,\nmany the victim of fire, many with substantial pieces missing.\n\nWith the signature of the New York District Chief on  appropriate\nforms, the FBI took possession of one Ford Econoline van, or what\nwas left of it.  The New York police were just as glad to be  rid\nof   it.   It was one less mess they had to worry  about.   Fine,\ntake  it.  It's yours. Just make sure that the  paperwork  covers\nours  asses.  Good, that seems to do it.  Now get out.   Frigging\nFeds.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTyrone Duncan took an evening Trump Shuttle down to  Washington's\nNational Airport.  The 7:30 flight was dubbed the Federal Express\nby the stewardesses because it was primarily congressmen,  diplo-\nmats  and other Washington denizens who took this  flight.   They\nwanted  to  get to D.C. before the cocktail  parties  began   and\nfound  the 2-drink flight an excellent means to tune up.   Duncan\nwas  met  out in front by a driver who held up a sign  that  read\n'Burnson'.\n\nHe  got into the car in silence and was driven to a residence  on\n\"P\"  Street  off Wisconsin in Georgetown.   The  brick  townhouse\nlooked  like  every  other million dollar home  in  the  affluent\nWashington  bedroom community. But this one was special.  It  not\nonly  served  as a home away from home for Bob  Burnson  when  he\nworked  late, but it was also a common neutral meeting place  far\nfrom prying eyes and ears.   This night was one such case.\n\nAn older, matronly lady answered the door.\n\n\"May  I  help you?\"  She went through the formality for  the  few\naccidental tourists who rang the bell.\n\n\"I'm  here to see Mr. Merriweather.  He's expecting me.\"   Merri-\nweather  was the nom-de-guerre of Bob Burnson,  at least at  this\nlocation.  Duncan was ushered into the elegant old sitting  room,\nwhere  the  butleress  closed the door behind  him.   He  double-\nchecked that she was gone and walked over to the fireplace.   The\nmarble  facade was worn in places, from overuse he  assumed,  but\nnonetheless,  traces of its 19th century elegance  remained.   He\nlooked up at the large full length standing portrait of a somber,\nformal man dressed in a three piece suit.  Undoubtedly this  vain\nportrait  was his only remaining legacy, whoever he  was.  Tyrone\npressed a small button built into the side of the picture frame.\n\nAn  adjoining  bookcase slipped  back into the wall,  exposing  a\ndark  entry.  Duncan squeezed his bulk through the  narrow  wedge\nprovided by the opened bookcase.\n\nThe  blank wall behind him closed and the lights in the  room  he\nentered slowly brightened.  Three people were seated at an  over-\nsized  table with black modern executive chairs around  it.   The\nroom  was large.  Too large to fit behind the 18 foot width of  a\nGeorgetown  brownstone.  The adjacent building must be an  ersatz\ncover for the privacy that this domicile required.  The room  was\nsimple,  but  formal.  Stark white walls  and  their  nondescript\nmodern paintings were illuminated by recessed lights.  The  black\ntrim  work was the only accent that the frugal decorator  permit-\nted.\n\nHis old friend and superior Bob Burnson was seated in the middle.\nThe  other two men were civil servants in their mid 40's as  near\nas  Duncan  could  determine.  Both wore  Government  issue  blue\nsuits,  white shirts and diagonally striped maroon  ties.   Their\nhair was regulation above the ears, immaculately kept.   Reminded\nDuncan  of  the junior clerks on Wall Street.   They  could  only\nafford suits from the discount racks, but still tried to make   a\ndecent  impression.  The attempt usually failed, but G-Men  stuck\nto  the tradition of poor dress. He had never seen either of  the\nmen  that flanked Burnson, which wasn't unusual.   He was  a  New\nYorker  who carefully avoided the cacophony of  Washington  poli-\ntics.  He played the political game once nearly 30 years  ago  to\nsecure his position, but he had studiously avoided it since.\n\n\"Thanks for making it on such short notice,\"  Burnson solicitous-\nly  greeted  Duncan.   He did it for the benefit  of  the  others\npresent.\n\n\"Yes  sir.  Glad to help.\"  Duncan groaned through the  lie.   He\nhad been ordered to this command performance.\n\n\"This  is,\" Burnson gestured to his right, \"Martin  Templer,  our\nCIA  liaison,  and,\"  pointing to his  left,  \"Charlie  Sorenson,\nassistant DIRNSA, from the Fort.\"  They all shook hands  perfunc-\ntorily.   \"Care  for  a drink?\"  Burnson asked.   \"We're  not  on\nGovernment time.\"\n\nDuncan looked and saw they were all drinking something other than\nCoke.   The bar behind them showed recent use.  \"Absolut  on  the\nrocks.   If  you  have it.\"  It was Duncan's  first  time  to  'P\nStreet' as this well disguised location was called. Burnson  rose\nand poured the vodka over perfectly formed ice cubes.  He  handed\nthe drink to Duncan and indicated he should take a seat.\n\nThey exchanged pleasantries, and Duncan spoke of the  improvement\nin the Northeast corridor Shuttle service; the flight was  almost\non time. Enough of the niceties.\n\n\"We don't want to hold you up more than necessary, but since  you\nwere  here in town we thought we could discuss a couple  of  mat-\nters.\"   Burnson  was the only one to speak. The  others  watched\nDuncan  too  closely for his taste.  What a white wash.   He  was\ncalled down here, pronto.  Since I'm here, my ass.\n\n\"No problem sir.\" He carried the charade forward.\n\n\"We need to know more about your report.  This morning's report.\"\nSorenson,  the NSA man spoke.  \"It was most intriguing.  Can  you\nfill  us in?\"  He sipped his drink while maintaining eye  contact\nwith Duncan.\n\n\"Well, there's not much to say beyond what I put in.\"   Suspicion\nwas evident in Duncan's voice.  \"I think that it's a real  possi-\nbility  that  there is a group who may be using  highly  advanced\ncomputer  equipment as weapons.  Or at least surveillance  tools.\nA massive operation is suspected.  I think I explained that in my\nreport.\"\n\n\"You  did  Tyrone,\"  Bob agreed.  \"It's just that  there  may  be\nadditional  considerations  that you're not aware of.   Things  I\nwasn't  even aware of.  Charlie, can you elaborate?\"  Bob  looked\nat the NSA man in deference.\n\n\"Thanks,  Bob,  be  glad to.\"  Charlie Sorenson  was  a  seasoned\nspook.  His casual manner was definitely practiced.   \"Basically,\nwe're following up on the matter of the van you reported, and the\nalleged  equipment it held.\"   He scanned the folder in front  of\nhim. \"It says here,\" he perused, \"that you discovered that  indi-\nviduals have learned how to read computer signals, unbeknownst to\nthe computer users.\"  He looked up  at Duncan for a confirmation.\nTyrone felt slightly uncomfortable. \"Is that right?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" Duncan replied. \"From the information we've received,\nit appears that a group has the ability to detect computer radia-\ntion  from  great distances.  This technique  allows  someone  to\ncompromise computer privacy . . .\"\n\n\"We know what it is Mr. Duncan.\"  The NSA man cut him off abrupt-\nly.  Duncan  looked at Burnson who avoided his stare.   \"What  we\nwant  to   know is, how do you know?  How do you  know  what  CMR\nradiation  is?\"  There was no smile or sense of warmth  from  the\ninquisitor.   Not  that  there had been  since  the  unpropitious\nbeginning of this evening.\n\n\"CMR?\" Tyrone wasn't familiar with the term.\n\n\"Coherent Monitor Radiation.  What do you know?\"\n\n\"There was a van that crashed in New York a couple of days  ago.\"\nDuncan was not sure what direction this conversation was going to\ntake.  \"I have reason to believe it contained computer  equipment\nthat was capable of reading computer screens from a distance.\"\n\n\"What  cases are you working on that relate to this?\"  Again  the\nNSA man sounded like he was prosecuting a case in court.\n\n\"I  have been working on a blackmail case,\"  Duncan  said.   \"Now\nI'm  the  agency liaison with ECCO and CERT.   Looking  into  the\nINTERNET problems.\"\n\nThe  two  G-men   looked at each other.   Templer  from  the  CIA\nshrugged at Sorenson.  Burnson was ignored.\n\n\"Are you aware that you are working in an area of extreme nation-\nal security?\"  Sorenson pointedly asked Duncan.\n\nTyrone  Duncan thought for a few seconds before  responding.   \"I\nwould imagine that if computers can be read from a distance  then\nthere  is a potential national security issue.  But I can  assure\nyou, it was brought to my attention through other means.\"  Duncan\ntried to sound confident of his position.\n\n\"Mr.  Duncan,\" Sorenson began, \"I will tell you something, and  I\nwill only tell you because you have been pre-cleared.\"  He waited\nfor a reaction, but Duncan did not give him the satisfaction of a\nsublimation.   Cleared  my ass.  Fucking spooks. Duncan  had  the\ncommon sense to censor himself effectively.\n\n\"CMR  radiation,  as it is called, is a major threat  facing  our\ncomputers  today.   Do you know what that means?\"   Sorenson  was\nbeing solicitous.  Tyrone had to play along.\n\n\"From  what  I gather, it means that our computers are  not  safe\nfrom eavesdropping. Anyone can listen in.\"  Tyrone spoke  coldly.\nOther than Bob, he was not with friends.\n\n\"Let me put  it succinctly,\"  Sorenson said.  \"CMR radiation  has\nbeen  classified for several years.  We don't even admit that  it\nexists.   If  we  did, there could be panic.  As far  as  we  are\nconcerned  with  the  public, CMR radiation is a  figment  of  an\ninventive imagination.  Do you follow?\"\n\n\"Yes,\"  Duncan agreed, \"but why?  It doesn't seem to be much of a\nsecret to too many people?\"\n\n\"That  poses two questions.  Have you ever heard of  the  Tempest\nProgram?\"\n\n\"Tempest? No. What is it?\" Duncan searched his mind.\n\n\"Tempest  is  a classified program managed by the  Department  of\nDefense and administered by the National Security Agency.  It has\nbeen in place for years.  The premise is  that computers  radiate\ninformation  that  our  enemies can pick  up  with  sophisticated\nequipment.   Computers broadcast signals that tell  what  they're\ndoing.   And they do it in two ways.  First they radiate  like  a\nradio station.  Anyone can pick it up.\"  This statement confirmed\nwhat  Scott  had been saying.  \"And,  computers  broadcast  their\nsignals  down  the  power lines.  If someone  tried,  they  could\nlisten to our AC lines and essentially know what was the computer\nwas  doing.  Read classified information.  I'm sure you  see  the\nproblem.\"  Sorenson was trying to be friendly, but he failed  the\ngeniality test.\n\nDuncan nodded in understanding.\n\n\"We are concerned because the Tempest  program is classified  and\nmore importantly, the Agency has been using CMR for years.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"The  NSA is chartered as the ears and eyes of  the intelligence\ncommunity.  We listen to other people for a living.\"\n\n\"You mean you spy on computers, too? Spying on civilians?   Isn't\nthat  illegal?\"  Tyrone remembered back when FBI and  CIA  abuses\nhad totally gotten out of hand.\n\n\"The  courts  have determined that eavesdropping in  on  cellular\nphone  conversations in not an invasion of privacy.  We take  the\nsame position on CMR.\"  Sorenson wanted to close the issue quick-\nly.\n\nDuncan  carefully prepared his answer amidst the outrage  he  was\nfeeling.  He sensed an arrogant Big Brother attitude at work.  He\nhated  the 'my shit doesn't stink' attitude of the NSA.   All  in\nthe  name  of National Security.  \"Until a couple of days  ago  I\nwould have thought this was pure science fiction.\"\n\n\"It  isn't  Mr. Duncan.  Tempest is a front line  of  defense  to\nprotect  American secrets.  We need to know what else  there  is;\nwhat you haven't put in your reports.\"  The NSA man pressed.\n\nDuncan  looked  at  Bob who had long ago ceased  to  control  the\nconversation.   He  got  no signs of support.  In  fact,  it  was\nalmost  the opposite.  He felt alone.  He had had little  contact\nwith  the Agency in his 30 years of service.  And when there  was\ncontact  it was relegated to briefings, policy shifts. .  .pretty\nbureaucratic stuff.\n\n\"As  I  said, it's all in the report.  When  there's  more,  I'll\nsubmit it.\"  Duncan maintained his composure.\n\n\"Mr.  Duncan, I don't think that will do.\"  Martin Templer  spoke\nup again.  \"We have been asked to assist the NSA in the matter.\"\n\n\"Whoah!   Wait a second.\"  Duncan's legal training had  not  been\nfor  naught.  He knew a thing or two about Federal  charters  and\ntask designations.  \"The NSA is just a listening post.  Your guys\ndo  the  international spook stuff, and we do  the  domestic  leg\nwork.  Since when is the Fort into investigations?\"\n\n\"Ty?   They're right.\"  The uneasiness in Bob's voice was  promi-\nnent.  \"The protection of classified information is their respon-\nsibility.   A  group was created to report on  computer  security\nproblems that might have an effect on national security.  On that\ncommittee  is  the Director of the NSA.  In  essence,  they  have\ncontrol.  Straight from 1600.  It's out of our hands.\"\n\nTyrone  was  never  the technical type, and  definitely  not  the\npolitician.  Besides, there was no way any one human being  could\nkeep  up with the plethora of regulations and rule  changes  that\npoured out of the three branches of government.  \"Are you telling\nme  that  the NSA can swoop down on our turf and take  the  cases\nthey want, when they want?\"  Duncan hoped he had heard wrong.\n\n\"Mr.  Duncan,  I  think you may be under  a  mistaken  impression\nhere.\"  Sorenson sipped his drink and turned in the swivel chair.\n\"We don't want anything to do with your current cases, especially\nthe  alleged  blackmail operation in place.   That  is  certainly\nwithin the domain of the FBI.  No.  All we want is the van.\"  The\nNSA  man realized he may have come on a little strong and  Duncan\nhad misunderstood.  This should clear everything up nicely.\n\nTyrone decided to extricate himself from any further  involvement\nwith these guys.  He would offer what he knew, selectively.\n\n\"Take the van, it's yours.  Or what's left of it.\"\n\n\"Who else knows about CMR?  How is works?\"  Sorenson wanted  more\nthan the van.\n\nDuncan  didn't  answer.  An arrogance, a defiance came  over  him\nthat  Bob  Burnson saw immediately.  \"Tell them where  you  found\nout, Ty.\"  He saw Duncan's negative facial reaction.  \"That's  an\norder.\"\n\nHow  could he minimize the importance of Scott's contribution  to\nhis  understanding  of CMR radiation?  How could  he  rationalize\ntheir  relationship?  He thought, and then realized it might  not\nmatter.  Scott had said he already had his story, and no one  had\ndone anything wrong.   Actually  they had only had a casual  con-\nversation on a train, as commuter buddies, what was the harm?  It\nreally exposed him more than Scott  if anything came of it.\n\n\"From  an  engineer  friend of mine.  He told  me  about  how  it\nworked.\"\n\nThe  reactions from the CIA and NSA G-Men were  poorly  concealed\nastonishment.  Both made rapid notes.  \"Where does he work?   For\na defense contractor?\"\n\n\"No, he's also a reporter.\"\n\n\"A reporter?\" Sorenson gasped.  \"For what paper?\"  He breathless-\nly  prayed that it was a local high school journal, but  his  gut\ntold him otherwise.\n\n\"The  New  York City Times,\"  Duncan said, confident  that  Scott\ncould  handle himself and that the First Amendment would help  if\nall else failed.\n\n\"Thank you very much Mr. Duncan.\"  Sorenson rapidly rose from his\nchair.  \"You've been most helpful.  Have a good flight back.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Tuesday.,  December 1\n     New York City\n\nThe morning commute into the City was agonizingly long for  Scott\nMason.  He nearly ran the 5 blocks from Grand Central Station  to\nthe  paper's  offices off Times Square.  The  elevator  wait  was\ninterminable.  He dashed into the City Room, bypassing his  desk,\nand ran directly toward editor Doug McQuire's desk.  Doug saw him\ncoming and was ready.\n\n\"Don't  stop here.  We're headed up to Higgins.\"  Doug  tried  to\ndeflect the verbal onslaught from Scott.\n\n\"What the hell is going on here, Doug?  I work on a great  story,\nyou  said you loved it, and then I finally get the missing  piece\nand  then   . . .this?\"  He pushed the morning  paper  in  Doug's\nface.  \"Where the fuck is my story? And don't give me any of this\n'we  didn't  have the room' shit.  You yourself thought  we  were\nonto something bigger . . .\"\n\nDoug  ignored Scott as best he could, but on the elevator to  the\n9th floor, Scott was still in his face.\n\n\"Doug, I am not a pimple faced cub reporter.  I never was, that's\nwhy you hired me. You've always been straight with me . . .\"\n\nScott  trailed  behind Doug as they walked down  the  hallway  to\nHiggins'  office.   He was still calling Doug every name  in  the\nbook  as they entered the room.  Higgins sat behind his desk,  no\ntie,  totally  un-Higgins-like.   Scott shot  out  another  nasty\nremark.\n\n\"Hey, you look like shit.\"\n\n\"Thanks to you,\" the bedraggled Higgins replied.\n\n\"What?   You  too?  I need this today.\" Scott's  anger  displayed\nconcern as well.\n\n\"Sit  down.   We got troubles.\"  Higgins could be  forceful  when\nnecessary.   Apparently he felt this was an appropriate  time  to\nuse  his drill sergeant voice.  It startled Scott so he sat -  on\nthe  edge  of his seat.  He wasn't through dishing  out  what  he\nthought about having a story pulled this way.\n\nHiggins waited for nearly half a minute.  Let some calm, normalcy\nreturn before he started.\n\n\"Scott,  I  pulled the story, Doug didn't. And, if it  makes  you\nfeel  any better, we've both been here all night.  And we've  had\noutside counsel lose sleep, too.  Congratulations.\"\n\nScott was confused.  Congratulations?  \"What are you . . .?\"\n\n\"Hear  me out.  In my 14 years at this paper, this is  the  first\ntime  I've  ever had a call from the  Attorney  General's  office\ntelling  me, ordering me, that I, we had better not run a  story.\nI  am as confused as you.\"  Higgins' sincerity was  real;  tired,\nbut real.\n\nScott  suddenly felt a twinge of guilt, but not enough to  remove\nthe anger he still felt.  \"What ever happened to the first amend-\nment?\" Irate confusion was  written all over his face.\n\n\"Here  me out before you pull the switch,\"  Higgins sounded  very\ntired.   \"About  10:30  last night I got a call  from  the  Print\nChief.  He said that the NYPD was at the plant with a restraining\norder  that  we not print a story you had written.   What  should\nthey do, he asked.  Needless to say I had to come down, so I told\nhim, hold the presses, for a half hour.  I called Ms.  Manchester\nand  she  met me here just after eleven.  The officer  had  court\norders, from Washington, signed by the Attorney General personal-\nly, informing us that if we published certain information, alleg-\nedly  written  by you, the paper could be found in  violation  of\nsome bullshit national security laws they made up on the spot.\n\n\"I called Doug, who was pleased to hear from me at midnight I can\nassure  you, and he agreed.  Pull it. Whatever was going on,  the\nstory  was so strong, that we can always print it in a  few  days\nonce  we sorted it out.  We had no choice.  But now, we  need  to\nknow, what is going on?\"  Higgins was clearly exhausted.\n\nScott  was at a loss for words.  \"I  . . .uh . . .  dunno.   What\ndid the court order say?\"\n\n\"That  the paper will, will is their word, refrain from  printing\nanything with regards to CMR.  And CMR was all over your article.\nNobody here knew much about it, other than what was in the  arti-\ncle, and we couldn't reach you, so we figured that we might  save\nourselves a bushel of trouble by waiting.  Just a day or two,\" he\nquickly added.\n\n\"How  the  hell did they find out ?\"   Scott's  mind  immediately\nblamed  Tyrone.   He had been betrayed.  Used.  Goddamn  it.   He\nknew  better than to trust a Fed.  Shit.  Tyrone must  have  gone\nupstairs   and  told  his  cronies  that  I  was  onto  a   story\nand . . .well one thing led to another.  But Jeez . . .the Attor-\nney General's office.\n\n\"Scott, what is going on here?\"  Higgins asked but Doug wanted to\nknow  as  well.  \"It looks like you've got a tiger by  the  tail.\nAnd  the  tiger is in Washington.  Seems like you've  pissed  off\nsome important people.  We need to know, the whole bit.  What are\nyou onto?\"\n\n\"It's  all in the story,\" Scott said, emotionally drained  before\n9:00  AM.  \"Whatever I know is there.  It's all  been  confirmed,\nDoug  saw  the  notes.\" Doug nodded, yes, the  reporting  was  as\naccurate as is expected in such cases.\n\n\"Well,\"   Higgins continued, \"it seems that our friends in  Wash-\nington  don't want any of this printed,  for their  own  reasons.\nIs any of this classified, Scott?\"\n\n\"If  it is, I don't know it,\" Scott lamely explained.  He felt up\nagainst an invisible wall.  \"I got my confirmations from a couple\nof  engineers  and a hacker type who is up on  computer  security\nstuff. This stuff is chicken feed compared to SDI and the Stealth\nBomber.\"\n\n\"So why do they care?\"\n\n\"I have an idea, but I can't prove it yet,\" offered Scott.\n\n\"Lay it on us, kid,\" said Doug approvingly.  He loved  controver-\nsial reporting, and this had the makings of . . .\n\n\"What  if  between this and the Exchange we fell  into  a  secret\nweapons program,\" Scott began.\n\n\"Too  simple.  Been done before without this kind  of  backlash,\"\nHiggins said dismissing the idea.\n\n\"Except,  these weapons can be built by any high school kid  with\nan  electronics lab and a PC,\" Scott retorted undaunted.   \"Maybe\nnot  as good, or as powerful, but nonetheless, effective. If  you\nwere the government, would you want every Tom, Dick and  Shithead\nto build home versions of cruise missiles?\"\n\n\"I  think you're exaggerating a little, Scott.\"  Higgins  pinched\nhis nose by the corners of his eyes. \"Doug?  What do you think?\"\n\nDoug  was amazingly collected. \"I think,\" he said  slowly,  \"that\nScott  is onto a once in a lifetime story.  My gut tells me  this\nis real.  And still, we only have a small piece of the puzzle.\"\n\n\"Scott?   Get  right back on it,\" Doug ordered. \"I want  to  know\nwhat  the big stink is.  Higgins will use outside counsel to  see\nif  they dig anything up, but I believe you'll have better  luck.\nIt  seems that you've stumbled on something that  the  Government\nwants kept secret.  Keep up the good work.\"\n\nScott  was  being congratulated on having a story  pulled,  which\naroused mixed emotions within him.  His boss thought it wonderful\nthat it was pulled.  It all depends what side of the fence you're\non, I guess.\n\n\"I have a couple  of calls to make.\"  Scott excused himself  from\nHiggins'  domain  to get back to his desk.   He  dialed  Duncan's\nprivate number.\n\n\"4543,\" Duncan answered gruffly.\n\n\"Fuck  you very much.\"  Scott enjoyed slamming down the phone  as\nhard as he could.\n\nScott's second call wouldn't be for hours.  He wished it could be\nsooner,  so the day passed excruciatingly slowly. But, it had  to\nwait.  Safety was a concern, not getting caught was paramount. He\nwas going to rob a bank.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Washington, D.C.\n\n\"I will call you in 5 minutes.\"\n\nMiles  Foster  heard the click of the phone in his ear.   It  was\nHomosoto. At midnight no less.  He had no choice.  It was  better\nto speak to Homosoto over the computer than in person.  He didn't\nhave to hear the condescension.  He turned his Compaq 486 back on\nand  initiated  the  auto-answer mode on the  modem  through  the\nProTalk software package.\n\nMiles was alone.  He had sent Perky home a few minutes before.\n\nHe  heard his modem ring, and saw the computer answer.  The  com-\nputer automatically set the communications parameters and matched\nthe  crypt  key as chosen by the  caller,  undoubtedly  Homosoto.\nMiles  set  his  PRG code to prove to the computer  that  it  was\nreally him and he waited for the first message.\n\nWE NEED TO TALK.\n\nThat was obvious, why state the obvious, thought Miles.\n\nI am listening.\n\nONE OF THE READERS IS DEAD.  HIS EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN CAPTURED.\n\nBy whom?\n\nTHE NEW YORK POLICE.  THERE WAS A CAR ACCIDENT.  THEN THE FBI GOT\nTHE  READER.  THEN THE NSA, STEPPED IN AND TOOK OVER.  THEY  EVEN\nHAVE INTERFERED WITH THE PRESS.  SCOTT MASON WROTE A STORY ON THE\nREADERS AND THE GOVERNMENT STOPPED HIM.\n\nHow?  We don't do that sort of stuff.\n\nOBVIOUSLY YOU DO, MR. FOSTER.  I HAVE MY SOURCES AS YOU DO.\n\nThey don't screw with the press, though.  That's frowned upon.\n\nMAYBE SO, BUT TRUE.  WE NEED TO GET THIS MASON BACK ON THE TRACK.\nHE IS WHAT WE NEED.\n\nWhy him?\n\nSIMPLE.   WE HAVE SENT READER INFORMATION TO SEVERAL  NEWSPAPERS.\nTHE ONLY ONE TO PRINT HAS BEEN YOUR NATIONAL EXPOSE.  THAT PAPER,\nI  BELIEVE  IS SOLD AT SUPERMARKETS AND READ BY WOMEN  WHO  WATCH\nSOAP  OPERAS.  MR. MASON IS AN ENGINEER WHO UNDERSTANDS. WE  NEED\nHIM  BACK.  HE IS VALUABLE TO OUR PLAN.  IN YOUR  COUNTRY  PEOPLE\nLISTEN TO THE PRESS.  BUT YOUR GOVERNMENT STOPPED HIM.  WE CANNOT\nLET HIM FAIL.\n\nHow much does he know?\n\nAS  MUCH  AS  WE WANT HIM TO.  NO MORE.  WE WANT TO  FEED  HIM  A\nLITTLE AT A TIME, AS WE PLANNED. I AM AFRAID HE WILL BE  DISCOUR-\nAGED  AND ABANDON THE HUNT.  YOU KNOW HOW CRITICAL THE PRESS  IS.\nTHEY ARE OUR MOUTHPIECE.\n\nYes, I agree.  I wish I knew how you find out these things.\n\nMANY PEOPLE OWE ME FAVORS.  WE MAY HAVE LOST AFTER PEARL  HARBOR,\nBUT  WE WON WITH THE TRANSISTOR RADIO AND VCRS.  THE WAR  IS  NOT\nOVER.\n\nWhat do you want me to do?\n\nMAKE  SURE  THAN MR. MASON IS KEPT INFORMED.  HE IS  BRIGHT.   HE\nUNDERSTANDS.  HIS VOICE  WILL BE HEARD.  HE MUST NOT BE  STOPPED.\nI WILL DO WHAT I CAN AS WELL.  PUT HIM BACK ON THE TRACK.\n\nI know how to do that.  That will not be a problem.  Do we  still\nhave readers?\n\nYES,  WE  LOST ONLY ONE, AND THAT IS NOT HURTING.  WE  HAVE  MANY\nMORE.\n\nHow many?\n\nMR. FOSTER, YOU WROTE THE PLAN. DID YOU FORGET?\n\nNo, I know.  Curiosity.\n\nKILLED THE CAT AS YOU SAY.\n\nIt is my plan.\n\nWHICH  I BOUGHT. I WANT THE PUBLICITY, AS PLANNED.  SEE  THAT  WE\nGET IT.\n\nSure.\n\nMR. FOSTER? ONE MORE THING.\n\nYes.\n\nI  DO  NOT  HAVE A SLOPED BROW NOR IS RICE MY  PRIMARY  MEANS  OF\nPROPULSION.\n\nJust an expression.\n\nKEEP IT TO YOURSELF.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION  TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Midnight, Wednesday,  December 2\n     Scarsdale, New York\n\nSince  he had met Kirk, Scott had developed a mild affection  for\nhis long distance modem-pal, and pretended informer.  Now, it was\ntime  to take advantage of his new asset.  Maybe  the  Government\ncarries weight with their spook shit, but a bank can't push  hard\nenough  to  pull a story, if it's true.  And Kirk,  whoever  that\nwas, offered Scott the ideal way to prove it.  Do it yourself.\n\nSo he prepared himself for a long night, and he would  definitely\nsleep  in tomorrow; no matter what! Scott so cherished his  sleep\ntime.   He  wormed  his way through the mess  of  the  downstairs\n\"study  in disaster,\" and made space by redistributing  the  mess\ninto other corners.\n\nHe  felt a commitment, an excitement that was beyond that of  de-\nveloping a great story. Scott was gripped with an intensity  that\nwas a result of the apprehension of invading a computer, and  the\nirony  of it all.  He was an engineer, turned writer, using  com-\nputers  as an active journalistic instrument other than for  word\nprocessing.   To Scott, the computer, being the news itself,  was\nbeing  used as a  tool to perform self examination as a  sentient\nbeing, as a separate entity.  Techno-psychoanalysis?\n\nIs  it  narcissistic for man's tools to use  themselves  as  both\nimages of the mirror of reflective analysis? They say man's brain\ncan never fully understand itself.  Is the same true with comput-\ners?   And since they grow in power so quickly compared to  man's\nsnail-like  millennia by millennia evolution, can they  catch  up\nwith themselves?\n\nBack to reality, Scott.  The Great American Techno-Philosophy and\nPulitzer  could  wait.   He had a bank to rob.   Scott  left  his\ncomputer  on  all the time since Kirk had first called.   If  the\nIntergalactic  Traveler called back, the computer  would  answer,\nand  Kirk could leave a message.  Scott checked the Mail  Box  in\nthe ProCom communications program.  No calls.  Not that his modem\nwas a popular number.  Only he, his office computer and Kirk knew\nit.  And the phone company, but everyone knows about them . . .\n\nJust as the clock struck midnight, Kirk jumped in his seat.   Not\nonly  was  the bell chiming an annoying 12  mini-gongs,  but  his\ncomputer  was beeping.  It took a couple of beeps from the  small\nspeaker  in  his computer for him to realize he was  receiving  a\ncall.  What do I do know?  The 14\" color screen came alive and it\nentered terminal mode from the auto-answer screen that Scott  had\nleft yesterday.\n\nWTFO\n\nThe screen rang out.  Scott knew the answer.\n\nnaft\n\nVERY GOOD! COULDN'T HAVE SAID IT BETTER MYSELF.\n\nWelcome pilgrim, what has brought thee to these shores?\n\nI  GUESS WRITERS HAVE AN ADVANTAGE ON COMM.  MAKE  YOURSELF  VERY\nCOLORFUL.  CREATE ANY PICTURE YOU WANT.\n\nSeems a bit more sporting that hiding behind techy-talk.\n\nYEAH, WELL, I'LL WORK ON IT.\n\nSo, as Maynard G. Crebbs asked, \"You Rang?\"\n\nAH! DOBIE GILLIS.  NICK AT NIGHT!\n\nNo, the originals.\n\nWHEN WAS THAT?\n\nYou've just dated yourself.  Thanks.\n\nTO-FUCKING-SHAY!   NOT  AS OLD AS YOU.  READY FOR A TRIP  TO  THE\nBANK?\n\nYou read my mind :-)\n\nI  FIGURED  YOU'D WIMP OUT ON A SOLO TRIP, FIRST  TIME  AND  ALL.\nTHOUGHT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP.  I MAKE A HELL OF A CHAUFFEUR.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nI MEAN I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE.\n\nYou're kidding.  Just like Superman carries Lois Lane?\n\nJUST  ABOUT.   FIRST  I'M GOING TO SEND YOU A  COPY  OF  'MIRAGE'\nSOFTWARE.\n\nWhen?\n\nRIGHT  NOW.   THEN,  YOU'LL USE MIRAGE.  ALL YOU HAVE  TO  DO  IS\nEXECUTE FROM THE COMMAND LINE AFTER I DOWN LOAD.\n\nEnglish kimosabe.\n\nOK, ITS SIMPLE.  WHEN I SAY SO, YOU ENTER ALT-F9.  THAT SETS  YOU\nUP  TO  RECEIVE.  NAME THE FILE MIRAGE.EXE.   THERE'S  ONLY  ONE.\nTHEN  WHEN IT SAYS ITS DONE, PRESS CTRL-ALT-R.  YOU WILL  HAVE  A\nDOS LINE APPEAR.  ENTER MIRAGE.EXE AND RETURN.\n\nStop! I'm writing . . .\n\nUSE PRTSCR\n\nWhat's that?\n\nIS YOUR PRINTER ON LINE?\n\nYes.\n\nWHENEVER  YOU  WANT TO PRINT WHAT'S ON THE SCREEN  ENTER  'SHIFT-\nPrtScr'.  LOOK FOR IT. HIT IT NOW.\n\nThanks!  Got it.\n\nOR  SAVE THE WHOLE THING TO A FILE. USE CTRL-ALT-S.  THEN PICK  A\nNEW FILE NAME.  MEANS MONGO EDITING THOUGH.\n\nDone!   I like Ctrl-Alt-S.  Suits me fine.  No memory needed.\n\nHIT ALT-F9.  MIRAGE IS COMING.\n\nScott did as instructed.  The entire procedure made sense  intel-\nlectually,  but inside, there was an inherent disbelief that  any\nof these simple procedures would produce anything meaningful.  It\nis inherently difficult to feel progress, a sense of  achievement\nwithout instantaneous feedback that all was well.\n\nLess than a minute later, the screen told Scott it was  finished.\nDid he want to Save the file? Yes.  Please name it.   Mirage.Exe.\nWould  you like to receive another? No.  Do you want to  exit  to\nCommand line?  Yes.  He entered Mirage.Exe as Kirk had  instruct-\ned,  hoping  that  he was still waiting at the  other  end.   The\nscreen  displayed various copyrights and Federal  warnings  about\nillegal  copying of software, the very crime Scott had just  com-\nmitted.\n\nThe  video  suddenly split into two windows.  The  bottom  window\nlooked just like the screen he used to talk to Kirk, except  much\nsmaller.   Only 10 out of a possible 25 lines. The upper half  of\nthe screen was new.  MIRAGE-Remote View (C)1988.\n\nKirk announced himself.\n\nWTFO\n\nYup!  I got something.  Two screens.\n\nGOOD.   THAT  MEANS EVERYTHING PROBABLY WORKED.  LET'S  TEST  IT.\nYOU  AND  I TALK JUST AS USUAL, ON THE SMALL WINDOW,  LIKE  WE'RE\nDOING  NOW.   ON  THE TOP WINDOW, YOU WILL SEE  WHAT  I'M  DOING.\nEXCEPT IN MINIATURE.  BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE 15 LINES TO SEE,  AND\nA NORMAL SCREEN IS 25 LINES, THE PROGRAM COMPRESSES THE SIGNAL TO\nDISPLAY IT IN FULL.  DO YOU HAVE A DECENT MONITOR?\n\nvga 14 inch\n\nGOOD.  YOU WON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.  REMEMBER, WHENEVER YOU  WANT\nA COPY OF THE SCREEN, HIT SHIFT-PRTSCR.\n\nCan't I save everything?\n\nCTRL-ALT-S, YEAH.\n\nDone.  Anything else?\n\nYOU CAN'T INTERFERE.  JUST ALONG FOR THE RIDE.\n\nA Sunday drive in the country . . .\n\nWITH ME DRIVING. HA!  FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS.\n\nScott  watched  with  his fingers sitting on  the  keyboard  with\nanticipation.   A phone number was displayed on top line  in  the\nUpper Window: 18005555500.\n\n     <<DIALING>>\n\nIn a few seconds the screen announced,\n\n     WELCOME TO USA-NET, THE COMPLETE DATA BASE.\n\nThe graphics got fancy but in black and white.\n\n     ARE YOU A FIRST TIME USER? NO\n\n     ID? XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n     PASSWORD? XXXXXXXX\n\nThe video monitor did not let Scott see the access codes.\n\n     Welcome to USA-NET, Kirk.\n     Time synchronizing:  0:04:57  December 18, 1990\n\n     DO YOU WANT THE MAIN MENU? Y\n\nScott's  large window began to scroll and fill with  lines  after\nline of options:\n\n     (A) Instructions\n     (B) Charges\n     (C) Updating\n     (D) OAG\n     (E) Shopping Menus\n     (F) Trading Menus\n     (G) Conversation Pits\n\nIn  all there were 54 choices displayed.  The lower  window  came\nalive.\n\nSEE HOW IT WORKS?\n\nFascinating.\n\nTHAT  WAS JUST A TEST.  NOW FOR THE REAL THING.  SURE  YOU  WANNA\nGO?\n\nScott had gone this far.  He would worry about the legalities  in\nthe morning.  Higgins would have his work cut out for him.\n\nAye, aye, Captain.\n\nENGAGE WARP ENGINES.\n\nThe upper window changed again.\n\n     QUIT?  Y\n     ARE YOU SURE?  Y\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\nAnother number flashed in the upper window.  12125559796.\n\n     <<DIALING>>\n\nAfter  less than 2 rings the screen announced that they  had  ar-\nrived  at the front doors to the computer system at  First  State\nBank,  in New York.  Another clue.  Kirk was not from  New  York.\nHe used an area code.\n\nScott  felt like looking back over his shoulders to see  who  was\nwatching  him.  His automatic flight-or-fight response  made  the\nexperience more exhilarating.  He tried to force his intellect to\nconvince  himself that he was far from view, unobservable,  unde-\ntectable.  Only partially successful, he remained tense realizing\nthat he was borderline legal.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION>>>>>>\n\nPORT  CONTROL  SECURITY, CENTRAL DATA  PROCESSING  CENTER,  FIRST\nSTATE BANK.

Here he was, riding shotgun on  a\ntrip through one of  New York's largest bank computers, and there\nwas no resistance.  He could not believe that he had more securi-\nty in his house than a bank with assets of over $10 Billion.  The\nbottom window showed Kirk's next message.\n\nWHAD'YA THINK?\n\nPretty stupid\n\nWHAT?\n\nThat the bank doesn't have better control\n\nVIVE LE HACKER!!!\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Wednesday, December 2\n     New York City\n\n\"Doug,\" Scott came into the office breathlessly, \"we have to  see\nHiggins.  I gotta great . . .\"\n\n\"Hey,  I thought you were gonna come in late today? Wire  in  the\ncopy?\"   He  looked at the New York clock on the  wall.   It  was\n9:15.   Scott  broke the promise he made to himself  to  come  in\nlate.\n\n\"Yeah,  well,  I  underslept.\"   He brandished a  thick  file  of\ncomputer printouts.  \"Before I write this one, I want Higgins and\nevery other lawyer God put on this green Earth to go over it.\"\n\n\"Since  when  did you get so concerned with pre-scrutiny.   As  I\nremember,  it  was  only yesterday that you  threatened  to  nuke\nHiggins'  house and everyone he ever met.\"  Doug pretended to  be\ncondescending.   Actually, the request was a great  leap  forward\nfor  Scott  and every other reporter.  Get pre-lawyered,  on  the\napproach, learn the guidelines, and maybe new rules before  plow-\ning ahead totally blind.\n\n\"Since  I broke into a bank last night!\"  Scott threw the  folder\ndown on Doug's desk.  \"Here.  I'm going to Rosie's for a  choles-\nterol fix.  Need a picker upper.\"\n\nWhen  Scott came back from a breakfast of deep fried fat and  pan\ngrilled  grease he grabbed his messages at the front  desk.  Only\none mattered:\n\n     Higgins.  11:00.  Be there.  Doug.\n\nStill the boss, thought Scott.\n\nHiggins' job was to approve controversial material, but it gener-\nally  didn't  surround only one reporter, on  so  many  different\nstories within such a short time span.\n\n\"Good to see you, Mason,\" snorted Higgins.\n\n\"Right.   Me too,\" he came back just as  sarcastically.   \"Doug.\"\nHe acknowledged his editor with only slightly more civility.\n\n\"John, the boy's been up all night,\" Doug conciliated to Higgins.\nHe  called all his reporters boys.  \"And Scott, lighten up.\"   He\nwas serious.\n\n\"Sure, Doug,\" he nodded.\n\nHiggins began. \"O.K., Scott, what is it this time?  Doug said you\nbroke  into a bank, and I haven't had time to go over these.\"  He\nheld   up the thick file of printouts.   \"In 25 words  or  less.\"\nThe legal succinctness annoyed Scott.\n\n\"Simple.   I tied in with a hacker last night,  'round  midnight.\nHe  had the passwords to get into the First State computers,  and\nwell, he showed me around.  Showed me how much damage can actual-\nly  be done by someone at a keyboard.  The tour lasted  almost  2\nhours.\"\n\n\"That's it?\" Asked Higgins.\n\n\"That's it?  Are you kidding?  Let me tell you a few things in 25\nwords  or more!\"  Scott was tired and the lack of sleep made  him\nirritable.\n\n\"I  did  a little checking before I went on this  excursion.  You\nbank at First, don't you, John?\"\n\nIt was a setup question.  \"Yes,\" Higgins said carefully.\n\n\"I thought so.  Here let me have that file.  Gimme a minute,\"  he\nsaid  flipping pages.  \"Here it is, and yes, correct me if I  say\nanything that you don't agree with.\"  His  curtness and accusato-\nry sound put both Higgins and Doug off.  Where was he going?\n\n\"John W. Higgins, social security number, 134-66-9241. Born Rock-\nville, Maryland, June 1, 1947.  You currently have $12,435.16  in\nyour checking account, $23,908.03 in savings . . .\"\n\nHiggins' jaw and pen dropped simultaneously.  Doug saw the  shock\non his face while Scott continued.\n\n\"Your  mortgage  at  115 Central Park West  is  $2,754.21.   Your\nportfolio  is split between, let's see, CD's, T-Bills,  the  bank\nacts  as  your broker, and you have three safety  deposit  boxes,\nonly  one to which your wife, Helen Beverly Simons,  has  access.\nYou make a deposit every two weeks . . .\"\n\n\"Stop!  How the hell do you know . . .\"\n\n\"Jeez you make that much? Can I be a lawyer too, huh? Please  Mr.\nHiggins?\"\n\nHiggins threw his chair back and stormed around his desk to  grab\nthe papers from Scott. Scott held them away.\n\n\"Let me see those!\" Higgins demanded.\n\n\"Say please. Say pretty please.\"\n\n\"Scott!\"  Doug  decided enough was enough.  Scott  had  made  his\npoint.  \"Cool it.  Let him have them.\"\n\n\"Sure,  boss!\"   He  grinned widely at Doug who  could  not,  for\nreasons of professional conduct, openly condone Scott's  perform-\nance, no matter how effective it was.\n\nHiggins looked at the top pages from where Scott was reading.  He\nread  them intently, looking from one to the other.   Slowly,  he\nwalked  back to his desk, and sat down, nearly missing the  chair\nbecause he was so engrossed.\n\nWithout  looking  up  he spoke softly.   \"This  is  unbelievable.\nUnbelievable.  I can't believe that you have this.\"  Suddenly  he\nspoke right to Scott.  \"You know this is privileged  information,\nyou  can't go telling anyone about my personal finances.  You  do\nknow that, right?\"  The concern was acute.\n\n\"Hey,  I don't really give a damn what you make, but I needed  to\nshake the tree.  This is serious shit.\"\n\n\"Scott,  you've  got  my total,  undivided  attention  now.   The\nfloor's yours.  You have up to 100 words.\"  Humor wasn't Higgins'\nstrong point, or his weak point, or any point, but Scott appreci-\nated  the gesture.  Doug could relax, too.  A peace  treaty,  for\nnow.\n\n\"Thanks,  John.\" Scott was sincere.  \"As you know I've been  run-\nning  a few stories on hackers, computer crimes, what have  you.\"\nHiggins rolled his eyes.  He remembered.  \"A few weeks ago I  got\na call from Captain Kirk.  He's a hacker.\"\n\n\"What  do you know about him?\"  Higgins was again  taking  notes.\nThe tape recorder was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Not much, yet, but I have a few ideas.  I would  hazard to guess\nthat he is younger.  Maybe in his late '20's, not from New  York,\nmaybe the Coast, and has a sense of responsibility.\"\n\n\"How do know this?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know, I guessed from our conversations.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you just ask?\"\n\n\"I  did.  But, he wants his anonymity.  It's the things he  says,\nthe  way he says them. The only reason I know he's a he   is  be-\ncause he called me on the phone first.\"\n\n\"When did you speak to him?\"  Higgins inquired.\n\n\"Only once.  After that it's been over computer.\"\n\n\"So it could be anyone really?\"\n\n\"Sure,  but  that doesn't matter.  It's what he did.   First,  we\nentered the computer . . .\"\n\n\"What do you mean we?\"  Higgins shot Scott a disapproving stare.\n\n\"We.  Like  him and me.  He tied my computer to his  so  I  could\nwatch what he was doing.  So, he gets into the computer . . .\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"With the passwords.  There were three.\"\n\n\"How did he get them?\"\n\n\"From  another hacker I assume. That's another story.\"  The  con-\nstant interruptions exasperated Scott. \"Let me finish, then grill\nme. O.K.?\"\n\nHiggins nodded.  Sure.\n\n\"So,  once we were in, he could do anything he wanted.  The  com-\nputer  thought he was the Systems Administrator, the head  honcho\nfor  all the bank's computer operations.  So we had  free  reign.\nThe first place we went was to Account Operations.  That's  where\nthe general account information on the bank's customers is  kept.\nI asked him for information on you.  Within seconds I knew a  lot\nabout  you.\"  Higgins frowned deeply. \"From there, he  asked  for\ndetailed information on your  files; credit cards, payment histo-\nry,  delinquencies,  loans  on cars, IRA's,  the  whole  shooting\nmatch.\"\n\n\"I have to interrupt here, Scott,\"  Higgins said edgily.   \"Could\nhe, or you have made changes, to, ah . . .my account?\"\n\n\"We did!\"\n\n\"You made changes?  What changes?\"  Higgins was aghast.\n\n\"We took all your savings and invested them in a new startup fast\nfood franchise called Press Rat and Wharthog Sandwiches, Inc.\"\n\n\"You have got be kidding.\"  Scott saw the sweat drops at Higgins'\nhairline.\n\n\"Yeah,  I am.  But he did show me how easy it is to make  adjust-\nments in account files.  Like pay off loans and have them  disap-\npear, invoke foreclosures, increase or decrease balances, whatev-\ner we wanted to do.\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ!\"\n\n\"That's not the half of it.  Not even a millionth of it.  See, we\nwent  through  lots  of accounts.  The bank  computer  must  hold\nhundreds  of thousands of account records, and we had  access  to\nthem all.  If we had wanted to, we could have erased them all, or\nzeroed them out, or made everyone rich overnight.\"\n\n\"Are  you  telling me,\"  Higgins spoke carefully, \"that  you  and\nthis  . . .hacker, illegally entered a bank computer and  changed\nrecords and . . .\"\n\n\"Whoah!\" Scott held up his hands to slow Higgins down.  \"We  left\neverything the way it was, no changes as far as I could tell.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"No,  I'm not.  I wasn't in the driver's seat.  I went along  for\nthe ride.\"\n\n\"What  else did you do last night, Scott?\"  Higgins  sounded  re-\nsigned  to more bad news. The legal implications must  have  been\ntoo much for him to handle.\n\n\"We  poked around transfer accounts, where they wire  money  from\none  bank  to another and through the Fed  Reserve.   Transaction\naccounts, reserves, statements, credit cards.  Use your  imagina-\ntion.  If a bank does it, we saw it.  The point is, John,  I need\nto know two things.\"\n\nJohn  Higgins sat back, apparently exhausted.  He knew  what  was\ncoming,  at least half of it.  His expression told Scott  to  ask\naway.  He could take it.\n\n\"First, did I do anything illegal, prosecutable?  You know what I\nmean.  And, can I run with it?  That's it.\"\n\nHiggins' head leaned back on the leather head rest as he began to\nspeak deliberately.  This was going to be a lawyer's  non-answer.\nScott was prepared for it.\n\n\"Did you commit a crime?\"  Higgins speculated.  \"My gut  reaction\nsays no, but I'm not up on the latest computer legislation.   Did\nyou, at any time, do anything to the bank's computers?\"\n\n\"No.  He had control.  I only had a window.\"\n\n\"Good, that helps.\"  The air thickened with anticipation as  Doug\nand Scott both waited for words of wisdom.  \"I could make a  good\nargument that you were a reporter, with appropriate  credentials,\ninterviewing an individual, who was, coincidentally, at the  same\ntime,  committing a crime.  That is, if what he did was a  crime.\nI don't know the answer to that yet.\n\n\"There  have been countless cases where a reporter has  witnessed\ncrimes and reported on them with total immunity.  Yes, the more I\nthink  about it, consider this.\"  Higgins seemed to have  renewed\nenergy.   The  law was his bible and Scott was listening  in  the\ncongregation. \"Reporters have often gone into hostage  situations\nwhere there is no doubt that a crime is in progress, to report on\nthe condition of the hostages.  That's O.K..  They have  followed\ndrug dealers into crack houses and filmed their activities.\"\n\nHiggins  thought  a  little more. \"Sure, that's  it.   The  arena\ndoesn't  change  the  rules.  You said you  couldn't  affect  the\ncomputers, right?\"  He wanted a confirmation.\n\n\"Right.   I  just  watched.  And . . .asked  him  to  do  certain\nthings.\"\n\n\"No you didn't!  Got that?  You watched, nothing else!\"   Higgins\ncracked sharply at Scott.  \"If anyone asks, you only watched.\"\n\n\"Gotcha.\"   Scott recognized the subtle difference.  He  did  not\nwant to be an aider or abettor of a crime.\n\n\"So, that makes it easy.  If you were in the hackers home, watch-\ning him over his shoulder, that would be no different from watch-\ning  him  over  a computer screen.\"  He  sounded  confident.   \"I\nguess.\"   He sounded less confident.  \"There is very little  case\nhistory on this stuff, so, if it came to it, we'd be in an inter-\nesting position to say the least.  But, to answer your  question,\nno, I don't think that you did anything illegal.\"\n\n\"Great.   So  I  can write the story and  . . .\"   Scott  made  a\nforgone conclusion without his lawyers advice.  There was no  way\nHiggins would let him get away with that.\n\n\"Hold your horses.  You say write a story, and based upon what  I\nknow so far, I think you can, but with some rules.\"\n\n\"What  kind  of rules?\"  Skepticism permeated  Scott's  slow  re-\nsponses.\n\n\"Simple  ones.   Are you planning on printing  the  passwords  to\ntheir computers?\"\n\n\"No, not at all. Why?\"\n\n\"Because,  that is illegal.  No doubt about it.  So,  good,  rule\none is easy.  Two, I want to read over this entire file and  have\na  review of everything before it goes to bed. Agreed?\"   Higgins\nlooked  at Doug who had not contributed much.  He merely  nodded,\nof course that would be fine.\n\n\"Three, no specifics.  No names of people you saw, nothing exact.\nWe do not want to be accused of violation of privacy in any  way,\nshape or form.\"\n\n\"That's  it?\"  Scott was pleasantly surprised. What  seemed  like\ncommon  sense to him was a legal spider web that Higgins was  re-\nquired to think through.\n\n\"Almost. Lastly, was this interview on the record?\"\n\nDamn good question, Scott thought.  \"I dunno.  I never asked,  it\ndidn't  seem  like a regular interview, and since  I  don't  know\nKirk's real name, he's not the story.  It was what he did that is\nthe story.  Does it matter?\"\n\n\"If the shit hits the fan it might, but I think we can get around\nit.  Just be careful what you say, so I don't have to redline 90%\nof it.  Fair enough?\"\n\nScott  was  pleased beyond control.  He stood to  thank  Higgins.\n\"Deal.  Thanks.\"  Scott began to turn.\n\n\"Scott?\"  Higgins called out.  \"One more thing.\"\n\nOh  no, he thought, the hammer was dropping.  He turned  back  to\nHiggins.  \"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Good  work.   You're  onto something.  Keep it up  and  keep  it\nclean.\"\n\n\"No problem.\"  Scott floated on air.  \"No, problem at all.\"\n\nBack at his desk, Scott called Hugh Sidneys.  He still worked  at\nState First, as far as he knew, and it was time to bring him  out\nof the closet, if possible.\n\n\"Hugh?\"   Scott said affably.  \"This is Scott Mason, over at  the\nTimes?\"\n\n\"Yeah?  Oh,  hello,\"  Sidneys said suspiciously.   \"What  do  you\nwant?\"\n\n\"Hugh, we need to talk.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"I think you know.  Would you like to talk here  on the phone, or\nprivately?\"  Sometimes leaving the mark only two options, neither\nparticularly  attractive,  would keep him  within  those  bounds.\nSidneys was an ideal person for this tact.\n\nThe  pregnant pause conveyed Sidney's consternation.   The  first\nperson to speak would lose, thought Scott.  Hugh spoke.\n\n\"Ah,   I  think  it  would  be  .  .  .ah  better  .  .  .if   we\nspoke . . .at . . .\"\n\n\"How about the same place?\" Scott offered.\n\n\"OK,\" Hugh was hesitant.  \"I guess so . . .when?\"\n\n\"Whenever you want.  No pressure.\"  Scott released the tension.\n\n\"I get off at 5, how about . . .?\"\n\n\"I'll be there.\"\n\n\"Yes ma'am.  This is Scott Mason.  I'm a reporter for the  Times.\nI  will  only take a few seconds of his time. Is he  in?\"   Scott\nused  his  kiss-the-secretary's-ass  voice.   Better  then  being\naggressive unless it was warranted.\n\n\"I'll  check,  Mr.  Mason,\" she said.  The phone  went  on  hold.\nAfter  a  very few seconds, the Muzak was replaced with  a  gruff\nmale voice.\n\n\"Mr.  Mason?  I'm Francis MacMillan.  How may I  help  you?\"   He\nconveyed self assuredness, vitality and defensiveness.\n\n\"I  won't take a moment, sir.\"  Scott actually took several  sec-\nonds  to make sure his question would be formed  accurately.   He\nprobably  only  had  one chance.  \"We have  been  researching  an\narticle on fraudulent investment practices on the part of various\nbanks;  some fall out from the S&L mess.\" He paused  for  effect.\n\"At  any  rate, we have received information that  accuses  First\nState  of  defrauding  it's investors.  In  particular,  we  have\nrecords  that show a complicated set of financial maneuvers  that\nare  designed to drain hundreds of millions of dollars  from  the\nassets of First State.  Do you have any comment?\"\n\nTotal silence.  The quality of fiber phone lines made the silence\nall the more deafening.\n\n\"If  you  would like some specifics, sir, I can provide  them  to\nyou,\"  Scott said adding salt to the wound. \"In many cases,  sir,\nyou are named as the person responsible for these activities.  We\nhave the documents and witnesses.  Again, we would like a comment\nbefore we go to print.\"\n\nAgain Scott was met with silence.  Last try.\n\n\"Lastly, Mr. MacMillan, we have evidence that your bank's comput-\ners  have  been invaded by hackers who can  alter  the  financial\nposture  of First State.  If I may say so, the evidence is  quite\ndamning.\"  Scott decided not to ask for a comment directly.   The\nquestion was no longer rhetorical, it was implicit.\n\nIf  feelings could be transmitted over phone wires,  Scott  heard\nMacMillan's  nerve  endings commence a primal scream.  The  phone\nexplosively hung up on Scott.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Thursday,  December 3\n     First State Bank, New York\n\nFrancis  MacMillan,  President of First State Savings  and  Loan,\nbellowed at the top of his lungs.  Three Vice Presidents were  in\nhis office before 7:00 A.M.\n\n\"Who the fuck's in charge of making sure the damned computers are\nsafe?\"\n\nThe  V.P.  of Data processing  replied.   \"It's  Jeanne  Fineman,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Fire him.\"\n\n\"Jeanne is a woman . . .\"\n\n\"Fire them both.  I want them out of here in 10 minutes.\"  McMil-\nlan's virulent intensity gave his aides no room for dissent.\n\n\"Sir, why, it's almost Christmas, and it wasn't her fault . . .\"\n\n\"And no bonus.  Make sure they never work near banks, or  comput-\ners ever again!  Got that?\"  Everyone nodded in shock.\n\n\"Al?\"   McMillan shouted.  \"Buy back our stock,   quietly.   When\nthe  market hears this we're in for a dump.  No one will  believe\nus  when  we  respond, and it will take us a day to  get  out  an\nanswer.\"\n\n\"How much?\" Al Shapiro asked.\n\n\"You figure it out.  Just keep it calm.\"  Shapiro noted it agree-\nably.\n\n\"Where the hell are the lawyers?  I want that pinko-faggot  news-\npaper stopped by tonight.\"  McMillan's rage presaged a very, very\nbad day at First State.\n\n\"And  someone, someone, find me that shit hole worm  Sidneys.   I\nwant  him in my office in 30 seconds.  Now,\" he violently  thrust\nhis  arms  in the air, \"get the hell out of here until  you  have\nsome good news.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday,  December 4\n\n     RUN ON FIRST STATE AS IT STALLS ON OWN BAILOUT\n     by Scott Mason\n\nSince yesterday afternoon, First State Savings and Loan has  been\nin asset-salvation mode.  Upon reports that computer hackers have\nhad access to First State's computers and records for some  time,\nand  can change their contents at will, the stock market  reacted\nnegatively  by  a sell-off. In the first 15 minutes  of  trading,\nFirst State's stock plummeted from 48 1/2 to 26 1/4, a  reduction\nof  one  half its value.  Subsequently, the stock moved  up  with\nblock  buying. At the noon bell, the stock had risen modestly  to\n31.  It is assumed that First State itself is repurchasing  their\nown stock in an attempt to bolster market confidence.\n\nHowever,  at 2:00PM, First State contacted banking  officials  in\nNew  York and Washington, as well as the SEC, to announce that  a\nrush of worried depositors had drained the bank of it's available\nhard  currency  reserves,  and would close  until  the  following\nmorning  when  cash transfers would permit the bank  to  continue\npayments.\n\nLast quarter cash holding were reported in excess of $3  Billion,\nand  First State has acknowledged that any and all monies   would\nbe available to those who desired it.  In a press release  issued\nby First State at 1:00 PM they said, \"A minor compromise  of  our\ncomputers has caused no discernible damage to the computers,  our\ncustomers  or the bank.  A thorough investigation has  determined\nthat  the  hacker was either a figment of the  imagination  of  a\nlocal  paper  or was based upon unfounded  hearsay.   The  bank's\nattorneys are reviewing their options.\"\n\nThe  combination of the two announcements only further  depressed\nFirst  State  stock.   It stood at 18 7/8 when  the  SEC  blocked\nfurther trading.\n\nThis  is Scott Mason, who reported the news as he saw it.   Accu-\nrately.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                    Chapter 15\n\n     Sunday,   December 6\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nMiles  Foster  was busy at one of the several  computers  in  his\nWashington,  D.C. condo.  It was necessary, on a daily basis,  to\nstay  in contact with a vast group of people who  were  executing\nportions of his master plan.  He thought it was going quite well,\nexceedingly  so  in  fact.  Spread over 3  continents  he  remote\ncontrolled  engineers  and programmers who  designed  methods  to\ncompromise computers.  With his guidance, though.  He broke  them\ninto  several groups, and none of them knew they were part  of  a\nmuch  larger  organization, nor did they have any idea  of  their\nultimate objective.\n\nEach of his computer criminals was recruited by Alex; that's  the\nonly  name that Miles knew. Alex.  Miles had drawn up a  list  of\nminimum  qualifications  for his 'staff'.  He forwarded  them  to\nHomosoto,  who, Miles guessed, passed them on to  the  ubiquitous\nyet  invisible  Alex.  That obviously wasn't his real  name,  but\nsuitable for conversation.\n\nMiles had developed a profile of the various talents he required.\nOne  group  needed to have excellent programming skills,  with  a\nbroad  range  of expertise in operating  systems.   An  operating\nsystem is much like English or any other language.  It is the O/S\nthat  allows  the computer to execute its commands.   Unless  the\ncomputer  understands  the  O/S, the computer is  deaf  dumb  and\nblind.   As a child learns to communicate, a computer  is  imbued\nwith  the basic knowledge to permit it to function.  It is  still\nessentially  stupid,  that is, it can't do anything  on  its  own\nwithout  instructions, but it can understand them when  they  are\ngiven.\n\nIn  order to violate a computer, a thorough understanding of  the\nO/S,  or  language of the computer is a must.   Good  programmers\nlearn  the  most efficient way to get a computer to  perform  the\ndesired  task. There are, as in any field, tricks of  the  trade.\nThrough  experience,  a  programmer will learn how  to  fool  the\ncomputer  into doing things  it might not be designed to do.   By\ntaking advantage of the features of the Operating System, many of\nthem unknown and therefore undocumented by the original designers\nof  the O/S, a computer programmer is able to extract  additional\nperformance from the equipment.\n\nSimilarly, though, such knowledge allows the motivated programmer\nto  bypass critical portions of the Operating System  to  perform\nspecific jobs and to circumvent any security measures that may be\npresent.   For example, in most of the 85,000,000 or so DOS  com-\nputers in the world, it is common knowledge that when you ERASE a\nfile,  you really don't erase it.  You merely erase the  NAME  of\nthe file.  If a secretary was told to dispose of document from  a\nfile  cabinet, and she only removed the name of each   file,  but\nleft  the contents remaining in the file drawers, she would  cer-\ntainly  have reason to worry for her job.  Such is an example  of\none of the countless security holes that permeate computer land.\n\nTo  take  advantage of such glaring omissions,  several  software\ncompanies  were  formed that allowed users to  retrieve  'erased'\nfiles.\n\nThese were among the skills that Miles wanted his people to have.\nHe  needed  them to be fluent in not only DOS, but  Unix,  Xenix,\nVMS,  Mac  and a host of other Operating Systems.   He  needed  a\ngroup  that knew the strengths and weaknesses of every major  O/S\nto  fulfill his mission.  They needed to be able to identify  and\nexploit  the trap doors and holes in all operating  and  security\nsystems.  From an engineering standpoint, Miles found it terrifi-\ncally  exciting.   Over the three years he had been  working  for\nHomosoto,  Miles  and his crew designed software  techniques  and\nhardware  tools that he didn't believe were even contemplated  by\nhis former employer, the NSA.\n\nThe  qualifications he sent to Homosoto were extensive,  detailed\nand  demanding.  Miles wasn't convinced that anyone but he  could\nfind the proper people.  The interview process alone was  crucial\nto  determining  an applicant's true abilities,  and  a  mediocre\nprogrammer could easily fool a non-technical person.  While Miles\nand Homosoto agreed that all programmers should be isolated  from\neach  other, Miles felt he should know them more than by a  coded\nname  over  modem lines.  Miles lost that battle with  one  swift\nword from Homosoto. No.\n\nTo Miles' surprise, within a few days of providing Homosoto  with\nis  recruitment lists, his 'staff' began calling him on his  com-\nputer.   To  call Miles, a computer needed his  number,  and  the\nproper  security codes.  To a man, or woman, they all did.   And,\nas  he  spoke to them over the public phone lines,  in  encrypted\nform  of  course,  he was amazed at their quality  and  level  of\ntechnical  sophistication.   Whoever Alex was, he knew how to  do\nhis job.\n\nOver  a period of a few months, Miles commanded the resources  of\nover  100 programmers.  But, Miles thought, there  was  something\nstrange  about  most of those with whom he  spoke.   They  seemed\nready  to  blindly follow instructions  without  questioning  the\nassigned tasks.  When a programmer takes a job or an  assignment,\nhe  usually knows that he will be designing a data base, or  word\nprocessor  or other application program.  However,  Miles'  staff\nwas to design programs intended to damage computers.\n\nHe  had  assembed the single largest virus software team  in  the\nworld,  and none of them questioned the nature or ethics  of  the\nwork.  Miles would have thought that while there  is considerable\ntechnical  talent around the world, finding people who  would  be\nwilling  to  work on projects to facilitate the  interruption  of\ncommunications and proper computer operations would have been the\nmost  difficult part of recruitment.  He realized he  was  wrong,\nalthough he did not know why.  Technical mercenaries perhaps?  He\nhad  never  seen an ad with that as a job title,  but,  what  the\nhell.   Money can buy anything.  Weapons designers  since  Oppen-\nheiner  have had to face similar moral dilemmas, and  with  wide-\nspread hatred of things American, recruitment couldn't have  been\nall that difficult.\n\nAs  he  sat in his apartment, he was receiving the  latest  virus\ndesigns  from one of his programmers who lived in the suburbs  of\nParis,  France.  While there was somewhat of a  language  barrier\nwhen they spoke, the computer language was a common  denominator,\nand  they all spoke that fluently.  It broke down  communications\nerrors.  Either it was in the code, or it wasn't.\n\nMiles  knew  this  designer only as Claude.  Claude's  virus  was\nsmall, less than 2K, or 2000 characters, but quite deadly.  Miles\nwent  over it and saw what it was designed to do.   Ooh,  clever,\nthought  Miles.  As many viruses do, this one attached itself  to\nthe  Command.Com file of the DOS Operating System.   Rather  than\nwait  for a specific future date, the next time the computer  was\nbooted, or turned on, Claude's virus in the O/S would play  havoc\nwith  the  chips  that permit a printer to be  connected  to  the\ncomputer.  In a matter of seconds, with no pre-warning, the  user\nwould  hear  a small fizzle, and smell the recognizable  odor  of\nelectronic burn.  During the time the user poked his nose  around\nthe  computer,  to see if the smell was real  or  imaginary,  the\nvirus would destroy the contents of the hard disk.\n\nAccording  to Claude, whose English was better than most  French-\nmen, there was a psychological advantage to this type of  double-\nduty  virus.  The victim would realize that his  computer  needed\nrepair  and  take it be fixed at his local computer  shop.   But,\nalas! Upon its return, the owner would find his hard disk trashed\nand attempt to blame the repairman.  Deviously clever.  Of course\nthis type of virus would be discovered before too long.  After  a\nfew  thousand  computers had their printer port  blown  up,  word\nwould  get around and the virus would be identified.  But,  mean-\nwhile, oh what fun.\n\nAs Miles prepared to send Claude's latest and greatest to another\nof  his staff for analysis and debugging, the computer  dedicated\nto  speaking to Homosoto beeped at him.  He glanced over at  Nip-\nCom.   He labeled all his computers with abbreviations.  In  this\ncase, Nippon Communications seemed appropriate.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION>>>>>>\n\nMR. FOSTER\n\nMiles  scooted his chair over to NipCom and entered his  PRG  re-\nsponse..\n\nHere Boss-san.  What's up\n\nYOU TELL ME.\n\nHuh?\n\nI READ THE PAPERS.  AGAIN YOU MOVE PRECIPITOUSLY.\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nFIRST STATE BANK.  YOUR INFECTORS ARE WITHOUT DISCIPLINE\n\nI still don't know what you mean\n\nTHE PAPERS HAVE SAID THAT FIRST STATE BANK WAS INVADED BY HACKERS\nAND THEIR STOCK DROPPED VERY MUCH.  IT IS STILL NOT TIME.\n\nOh, that.  Good bit of work.\n\nNO SO MR FOSTER.  I AM NOT PLEASED WITH YOU\n\nMe, why?  I didn't have anything to do with it\n\nEXPLAIN\n\nNothing  to explain.  My group doesn't do that, and even if  they\ndid, so what.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE VIRUSES?  I READ EVERY DAY OF NEW COMPUTER  VIRUS.\nTHEY MUST BE STOPPED.\n\nWhy?  It's all in good fun.  Let 'em release them all they want.\n\nTHEY WILL HURT OUR PLANS\n\nBull.  If anything, they help us.\n\nHOW IS THAT?\n\nGetting folks good and nervous.  They're beginning to  wonder who\nthey can trust. It sure as hell won't be the government.\n\nBUT IT IS IN THE PAPERS.\n\nSo?\n\nTHE  BANKS  WILL  PROTECT THEMSELVES.  THEY WILL  SEEN  WHAT  THE\nHACKERS DO AND MAKE OUR JOB MORE DIFFICULT.\n\nNot  a  chance.  Listen, there are hundreds, maybe  thousands  or\nmore  of  small time hackers who poke around  computers  all  the\ntime.   Sometimes they do some damage, but most of the time  they\nare  in  it  for the thrill.  The challenge.   They  are  loosely\norganized at best.  Maybe a few students at a university, or high\nschool  who  fancy themselves computer criminals.  Most  of  them\nwouldn't know what to do with the information if they took it.\n\nThe only reason this one hit the papers is because First is under\ninvestigation  anyway, some fraud stuff.  Literally thousands  of\ncomputers  are attacked every day, yet those don't appear in  the\npaper  or TV.  It's kind of like rape.  Companies don't  want  to\nadmit they've been violated.  And since damage has been  limited,\nat least as far as the scale upon which we function, it's a  non-\nissue.  I DO NOT SEE IT THAT WAY.\n\nWell,  that's the way it is.  There are maybe a half  dozen  well\ncoordinated hacking groups who care to cause damage.  The rest of\nthem, ignore them.  They're harmless.\n\nI WISH I BELIEVED THAT\n\nThere's not much we can do about it.\n\nWHY NOT STOP THEM\n\nWe  can't.   Look at our plans.  We have hundreds of  people  who\nhave a single purpose. We operate as a single entity.  The  hack-\ners  are only a small thorn.  Industry can't do much about  them,\nso they ignore them.  It is better that we ignore them, too.\n\nFIND THEM\n\nWho?\n\nTHE FIRST BANK ATTACKERS\n\nWhy?\n\nI WANT THEM STOPPED\n\nI told you, you can't do that. It's impossible.  Call the Arab.\n\nLOOK AT US, MR FOSTER.  NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE.\n\nWhat do you want me to do with them?\n\nTELL ME WHO THEY ARE.  I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT.\n\nI'll see what I can do.\n\nDO IT.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION  TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\nFuck, thought Miles.  Sometimes Homosoto can be such an  asshole.\nHe doesn't really understand this business.  I wonder how he  got\ninto it in the first place.\n\nHe remembered that he had to get Claude's virus properly analyzed\nand tested, so he sent it off to an American programmer who would\nperform  a  sanity-check on it.  If all went well he  would  then\nsend it out for distribution into America's computers through his\nBBS system set up just for that purpose.\n\nWith  Diet  Coke and Benson and Hedges Ultra Lights  in  hand  he\nfigured he might as well have someone look into Homosoto's  para-\nnoia.   With  some luck they could get a lead on  this  anonymous\nhacker and maybe Homosoto would leave him alone for a few  hours.\nThe  constant interruptions and micro-management was a  perpetual\npain in the ass.\n\nMiles  moved over to his BBS computer and told ProCom to dial  1-\n602-555-3490.   That  was the phone number of  the  Freedom  BBS,\nestablished  by Miles and several recruits that Alex had so  ably\nlocated.   It  was mid morning Arizona time.

Need some info.\n\nTHAT'S OUR MIDDLE NAME.  WHAT  DO YOU NEED?\n\nYou hear about the First Bank hacker?\n\nSURE!  I GOT A DOZEN PEOPLE TAKING CREDIT FOR IT.\n\nYou're kidding\n\nNO!  IT'S  A GOOD ONE.  BRING A BANK TO IT'S KNEES.   STOP  STOCK\nTRADING.  SEC INVESTIGATION.  A LOT OF OUR FOLKS WOULD HAVE  BEEN\nPROUD.\n\nWas it us?\n\nNO WAY.\n\nThen who, really?\n\nDAMNED IF I KNOW OR CARE.\n\nCare\n\nWHAT? SINCE WHEN DO WE CARE ABOUT THE AMATEURS?\n\nSince  now.  Things are heating up too soon.  I need to know  who\npulled the job.\n\nI CAN GET A LOT OF PEOPLE TO ADMIT IT, BUT I CAN'T VERIFY IT.\n\nWhoever did it is not likely to advertise it openly.  We may need\nto pull him into the open.\n\nGOTCHA\n\nHere's my thinking.  Assume the hack is just a kid.  He's getting\nno  credit and receives a shitty allowance.  So, we offer  a  re-\nward.   Whoever can prove that they are the one's who broke  into\nFirst Bank, we'll send them a new 386.  Whatever, use your imagi-\nnation.\n\nTHINK HE'LL BITE?\n\nIf  it's a pro, no.  But this doesn't ring of a pro.   The  news-\npapers know too much.\n\nAND IF WE FIND HIM?\n\nJust  get me his number and shipping address.  Make sure he  gets\nthe computer too.\n\nOK BOSS.  ANYTHING ELSE?\n\nKeep up the good work.  Oh, yeah.  I need the estimates.\n\nNO  PROBLEM.   THEY LOOK GREAT.  IN JUST OVER 2  YEARS,  WE  HAVE\nGIVEN  AWAY OVER 1,300,000 INFECTED PROGRAMS AND NONE  HAVE  GONE\nOFF YET.  ACCORDING TO PLAN.\n\nLove it.  Peace.\n\nBYE, YOU MF.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION  TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Monday, December 7\n     New York City\n\nThe phone on Scott Mason's desk had been unusually, but grateful-\nly quiet.  Higgins had been able to keep the First State  lawyers\nat  bay with the mounds of information the paper had  accumulated\non  MacMillan's doings.  The bank's stock was trading again,  but\nat a dilution of over 75%.  Most individual customers had  cashed\nout  their accounts, including Higgins, and only those long  term\nportfolios  remained.  Scott's stories on First Bank had won  him\nrecognition by his peers.  No awards, but an accolade at the  New\nYork Journalists Club dinner.  Not bad, he thought.\n\nNow the hard work continued for him.  The full background  analy-\nses, additional proof, more witnesses now that Sidneys was  under\nFederal  indictment and out of work.  MacMillan was  in  trouble,\nbut  it  was clear to Scott, that if the heat got turned  up  too\nmuch, there was a cache of millions offshore for the person  with\nthe right access codes.\n\nHis phone rang.\n\n\"Scott Mason.\"\n\n\"Hey, Scott this is Kirk.  We gotta talk, I'm in trouble.\"   Kirk\nsounded panicked.\n\n\"Damn Klingons,\" Scott cracked.\n\n\"Seriously, I'm in trouble.  You gotta help me out.\"\n\nScott realized this was no prank.  \"Sure, sure, calm down.   What\nhappened?\"\n\n\"They  found  me,  and they got into my  computer  and  now  it's\ngone . . .shit, I'm in trouble.  You gotta help me.\"\n\n\"Kirk!\"  Scott shouted.  \"Kirk, relax, ground  yourself.   You're\nnot making sense.  Take it from the beginning.\"\n\nKirk exhaled heavily in Scott's ear, taking several deep breaths.\n\"O.K., I'm O.K., but should we be talking on the phone?\"\n\n\"Hey, you called me . . .,\"  Scott said with irritation.\n\n\"Yeah, I know, but I'm not thinking so good.  You're right,  I'll\ncall you tonight.\"\n\nClick.\n\n* * * * *\n\nNightline  was  running  its closing credits  when  Scott's  home\ncomputer  beeped  at him.  Though Kirk had not told him  when  to\nexpect  a call, all other communications had begun  precisely  at\nmidnight, so Scott made  a reasonable deduction.\n\nThe  dormant  video  screen came to life as   the  first  message\nappeared.\n\nMASON\n\nThat was unlike Kirk to start a conversation that way.\n\nwtfo\n\nITS ME. KIRK.\n\nNow it was Scott's turn to be suspicious.\n\nProve it.\n\nAW CMON\n\nProve it.\n\nI CALLED YOU TODAY\n\nSo did half of the crack pots in New York\n\nI'M IN TROUBLE\n\nSo were the others.\n\nOK.  WE WENT THROUGH THE BANK AND HAD SOME FUN WITH  PRESSED  RAT\nAND WHARTHOG, INC.\n\nGood  enough.  You sound as scared here as you did on the  phone.\nI thought computers didn't have emotion.\n\nI DO.\n\nOK, what's up.\n\nTHEY FOUND ME\n\nWho?\n\nTHE PEOPLE FROM FIRST STATE BANK.\n\nHow? What?\n\nI RECEIVED A MESSAGE ON MY COMPUTER, E-MAIL.  IT SAID, STAY  AWAY\nFROM FIRST STATE BANK.  YOUR HACKING CAREER IS OVER. OR ELSE.\n\nWhat did you do?\n\nCALLED A FEW FRIENDS WHO THINK THEY'RE FUNNY.\n\nAnd?\n\nHONOR  AMONG THIEVES.  IT WASN'T THEM.  SO I FIGURED IT  WAS  FOR\nREAL.\n\nYou sure?\n\nAS  SURE AS I CAN BE.  MY ACTIVITIES ARE SUPPOSED TO  BE  SECRET.\nNO ONE KNOWS.  EXCEPT YOU.\n\nAnd you think I did something.\n\nTHE THOUGHT CROSSED MY MIND MORE THAN ONCE, I'LL TELL YOU. BUT, I\nTHINK I HAVE ELIMINATED YOU\n\nThanks, Why?\n\nNO MOTIVATION.  I'M MORE USE TO YOU ALIVE THAN DEAD.\n\nExcuse me?\n\nAS LONG AS MY IDENTITY AND ACTIVITIES REMAIN SECRET, I'M ALIVE AS\nA HACKER AND CAN CONTINUE TO DO WHAT I DO.  AS SOON AS I'M  FOUND\nOUT, IT'S OVER.  BUT THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.\n\nWhat is?\n\nI  CAME  HOME THIS MORNING AND FOUND THAT SOMEONE  BROKE  IN  AND\nTRASHED  EVERYTHING.   COMPUTERS, PRINTERS, MONITORS,  THE  WHOLE\nBALL OF WAX.  AND THERE WAS A NOTE.\n\nWhat did it say?\n\nWE KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE.  STAY OUT OF OUR COMPUTERS OR YOU  WILL\nBE SORRY.  IT WAS SIGNED FIRST STATE BANK.\n\nThat doesn't make sense.\n\nWHAT DOESN'T\n\nNobody except terrorists leave their calling card, and then  only\nwhen  they're sure they can't be caught.  I would bet dollars  to\ndonuts that First State had nothing to do with it.\n\nARE YOU SURE?\n\nNo,  I'm  not  sure, not 100%, but it  doesn't  add  up.   You've\nstepped  on somebody's toes, and it may or may not have  anything\nto do with First State.  They're just trying to scare you.\n\nAND DOING A DAMNED GOOD JOB OF IT\n\nHave you called the police.\n\nNO.  NOT YET.  I'M NOT IN THE LINE OF WORK THEY PROBABLY  APPROVE\nOF.\n\nSo I see.  Who else knew about your trips through the bank, other\nthan me. I will assume I'm not the guilty party.\n\nA COUPLE OF HACKER FRIENDS, MY GIRLFRIEND, THAT'S ABOUT IT.\n\nNo one else?\n\nNOT THAT I CAN THINK OF.\n\nLet me ask you.  If you wanted to find out who was hacking where,\nhow  would you find out?  Let's say you wanted to know what  your\nfriends were doing.  Is there a way?\n\nNOT WITHOUT A LOT OF EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT.  NO.  YOU WOULD HAVE TO\nTELL SOMEONE.\n\nAnd you told no one? No one?\n\nWELL, THERE WAS FREEDOM.\n\nWhat's Freedom?\n\nFREEDOM IS A NATIONAL BBS SYSTEM.  IT'S FAIRLY NEW.\n\nWhat do they do?\n\nLIKE MOST BBS'S, IT'S AN OPEN FORUM FOR EXCHANGE OF  INFORMATION,\nPROGRAMS,  ETC.  IT IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE  COUNTRY.   THEY\nHAVE  BBS AFFILIATES IN 50 OR 60 CITIES.  THEY ALSO RUN A  SHARE-\nWARE SERVICE.\n\nIs that significant?\n\nMOST  SHAREWARE COMPANIES SELL THEIR SOFTWARE ON  OTHER  PEOPLE'S\nBBS'S.  THE CONCEPT IS SIMPLE.  THEY GIVE AWAY THEIR SOFTWARE FOR\nFREE.  IF YOU LIKE IT, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SEND IN A FEW  DOLLARS\nAS A REGISTRATION, AND THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE MONEY.  IT'S PART  OF\nTHE  CULTURE,  DON'T BECOME RICH ON SOFTWARE.  FREEDOM  WRITES  A\nTREMENDOUS  AMOUNT  OF SOFTWARE AND THEY PUT IT ON THEIR  OWN  AS\nWELL AS OTHER BBS'S.  IT'S REAL SMART.  THEY BASICALLY HAVE THEIR\nOWN METHOD TO DISTRIBUTE THEIR SOFTWARE.\n\nDo they make money?\n\nWHO  KNOWS.  IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG OPERATION.  VERY  FEW  SHAREWARE\nPEOPLE MAKE MONEY, AND FREEDOM SAYS ITS NON-PROFIT.\n\nNon-Profit did you say? Are you sure?\n\nTHAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.\n\nWhat's their number?\n\nI ONLY HAVE THE LA NUMBER.\n\nSo you are from the Coast.\n\nSHIT.  YEAH.  I'M FROM THE COAST.\n\nThat was an accident.  I really don't care.\n\nI  KNOW.  IT MAY NOT MATTER.  I MAY GIVE IT UP. I DON'T  NEED  MY\nCOMPUTERS  BEING BLOWN TO SMITHERINES TO TELL ME I'M  BARKING  UP\nTHE WRONG TREE.\n\nMaybe it is the right tree.\n\nWHAT?\n\nNever mind. So, you said you told them?\n\nWELL,  KIND  OF.  YOU SEE, THEY ARE VERY  MUCH  AGAINST  HACKING.\nTHEY  ALWAYS  TALK  ABOUT PROSECUTING HACKERS, HOW  BAD  WE  ARE.\nAFTER THE FIRST STATE ARTICLES YOU WROTE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ON  THE\nCHAT LINE CLAIMED TO HAVE DONE THE JOB.  NOT THAT WE REALLY   DID\nANYTHING.   WE  JUST LOOKED AROUND.  ALL THESE GUYS  ADMITTED  TO\nHAVE  DONE  IT,  SO I ADDED MY TWO CENTS AND SAID I  DID  IT.   I\nTHOUGHT IT MIGHT ADD TO THE CONFUSION.\n\nApparently it did.\n\nWHAT DOES THAT MEAN?\n\nLet's say I had something to hide, and let's even say I was First\nState.\n\nSO\n\nSo, a bunch of people claim to have wrecked havoc on a  computer.\nWhat easier way to cover all the possible bases than to  threaten\nthem all.\n\nYOU MEAN EVERYONE WHO ADMITTED IT? OR CLAIMED IT?\n\nRight.  Get to them all.\n\nBUT HOW WOULD FIRST STATE KNOW ABOUT IT?\n\nI'm  not  saying  they did.  Do you know any of  the  others  who\nclaimed responsibility?\n\nNOT PERSONALLY.  ONLY ONE GUY NAMED DA VINCI I'VE TALKED TO.\n\nCan you call him?\n\nSURE, HE'S ON FREEDOM ALL THE TIME.\n\nDon't  use  Freedom. Is there any other way to contact  him?   On\nanother BBS?\n\nIT WOULDN'T BE HARD TO FIND OUT, BUT WHY NOT FREEDOM?\n\nLook.  This BBS may be the only link between the First State hack\nyou and I were in on,  by the way, did you use my name?\n\nDIDN'T NEED TO. YOU WROTE THE ARTICLE.  YOU'RE GETTING VERY  WELL\nKNOWN.\n\nThanks  for the warning. HA! At any rate, you check it  out  with\nthis  Da Vinci character and once you know, just call me  at  the\noffice,  and  say something like, the Mona  Lisa  frowned.   That\nmeans  he  got  a message similar to yours.   If  the  Mona  Lisa\nsmiles, then we can figure out something else. OK?\n\nSURE.  HEY, QUESTION.\n\nAnswer.\n\nSERIOUSLY.\n\nI'm serious.\n\nWHAT  DO YOU THINK'S GOING ON?  YOU BELIEVE IT'S  HACKERS,  DON'T\nYOU?\n\nbLet me ask you a question.  How many surrealistic painters  does\nit take to screw in a lightbulb?\n\nI GIVE. HOW MANY\n\nA fish.\n\nI DON'T UNDERSTAND\n\nThat's the point. Neither do I. Yet.  But you can help.   Accord-\ning  to  what  you're saying, there may be  some  weirdness  with\nFreedom.   What  do you recommend so I can dig a  little  deeper?\nInto  the whole cult of hacking.  And don't worry.  I don't  hang\nsources.  Besides, I think we may need each other.\n\nHOW DO YOU MEAN?\n\nI think you should talk to the authorities.\n\nNO WAY\n\nWait.   I have a friend, ex-friend, who knows about this kind  of\nthing, at least a little, and he might be of some help to you.  I\njust don't think it should go unreported.  Would you talk to him?\n\nLIVE OR MEMOREX?\n\nHe probably would want a face to face, but I can't say for sure.\n\nFORGET IT.  BUT I CAN HELP YOU WITH MORE SOURCES.  AT LEAST I CAN\nTELL YOU WHERE TO GO.\n\nSo can a lot of people.\n\nREALLY.  NEXT WEEK, THERE'S A CONVENTION OF SORTS FOR HACKERS.\n\nA convention?\n\nWELL, IT'S MORE LIKE AN UNDERGROUND MEETING, A LARGE ONE.   WHERE\nHACKERS  FROM  ALL OVER GET TOGETHER AND COMPARE NOTES.   IT'S  A\nGREAT  DEAL  OF  FUN, AND FOR YOU, MIGHT BE A  SOURCE  OF  LEADS.\nGENERALLY  SPEAKING  OF COURSE.  YOU CAN'T BE A BULL IN  A  CHINA\nSHOP.\n\nIn other words, reporters are taboo.\n\nKIND  OF.  YOU'LL NEED AN INVITATION, I CAN PROBABLY SWING  THAT.\nBEYOND THAT, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.  IT'S A VERY PRIVATE CLUB.\n\nWhere is this meeting?\n\nIN AMSTERDAM.\n\nHolland?\n\nYUP.\n\nWhy there?\n\nSIN  CITY IS AS GOOD FOR HACKERS AS IT IS FOR DRUGS AND SEX.   SO\nI'M TOLD.  HA HA.  THE POLICE DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT YOU DO.\n\nWhat goes on?\n\nBESIDES  THE USUAL AMSTERDAM ANTICS?  A COUPLE OF HUNDRED OF  THE\nBEST  HACKERS  IN THE WORLD SHOW UP TO OSTENSIBLY  SET  CODES  OF\nETHICS  FOR  THEMSELVES,  JUST LIKE FREEDOM  DOES.   IN  REALITY,\nTHOUGH,  WE  STROKE OUR EGOS AND PARADE AROUND  WITH  OUR  LATEST\nCLAIMS  TO FAME AND INVASIONS OF COMPUTERS.  WAR STORIES  OF  THE\nPREVIOUS  YEAR.  NEW CRACKING AND HACKING TECHNIQUES ARE  SHARED,\nPEOPLE LIE TO EACH OTHER ABOUT THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS AND TALK  ABOUT\nWHAT THEY WILL ACCOMPLISH IN THE NEXT YEAR.  PROGRAMASTERBATION.\n\nSome name.  Is that really what they call it?\n\nNAH, JUST A TERM WE USE.  I WENT LAST YEAR AND HAD A BALL, LITER-\nALLY.   IN  FACT, THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED HOW TO  GET  INTO  FIRST\nSTATE.  IT WAS SECOND RATE INFORMATION, FIRST STATE IS NOT EXACT-\nLY YOUR HIGH PROFILE BANK TO CRACK.\n\nUnderstood.  How do I get in, what's it called?\n\nIT'S  CALLED  THE INTERGALACTIC HACKERS  CONFERENCE,  I-HACK  FOR\nSHORT.  ONLY THE BEST GET TO GO.\n\nYou're kidding.  So what do you do to get me in?\n\nI CALL YOU AGAIN.  LEAVE YOUR BOX ON.  I'LL GET YOU AN INVITE.\n\nThat's great, I really appreciate that.  Will you be there?\n\nNOT THIS YEAR.  CAN'T SPARE THE TIME.  DON'T ACT LIKE A REPORTER.\nPARANOIA RUNS RAMPANT.\n\nWill anyone talk to me, as a reporter?\n\nTHAT'S UP TO YOU.  ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND SHOW SYMPATHY  FOR\nTHEIR  ACTIVITIES.  IF YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'LL MEET THE RIGHT  PERSON\nWHO CAN GIVE YOU A HANDS ON CRACKING LESSON.  FAIR ENOUGH?\n\nAgain,  thanks.  I'll expect your call.  And, I'll let  you  know\nwhat my Fed-Friend says about your problem.\n\nTA.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>><EIO>\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Tuesday,  December 8\n     Vienna, Austria\n\nVienna is not only the geographic center of Europe - for 45 years\nit has been the geopolitical center as well.   A neutral country,\nas  is Switzerland, it contains the highest concentration of  KGB\nand  CIA  operatives in the world.  Perhaps that  is  why  Martin\nTempler chose to meet Alex Spiradon there a week after his  meet-\ning with Tyrone Duncan at P Street.\n\nSituated by the Danube of Strauss fame, Vienna, Austria is an odd\nmixture  of the old, the very old and nouveau European high tech.\nDowntown  Vienna is small, a semi-circle  of cobblestone  streets\nand brash illuminated billboards at every juncture.\n\nTempler  contacted Alex through intermediaries stationed  in  Zu-\nrich.   The  agreed upon location was the third  bench  from  St.\nStephen's  Cathedral  on the Stephansplatz, where  Vienna's  main\nstreet,   Karntnerstrasse-Rotenturmstrasse  changes  names.    No\ntraffic is allowed on the square, on Kartnerstrasse or on Graben-\nstrasse,  so  it  is always packed with  shoppers,  tourists  and\nstreet musicians.  Ideal for a discreet meeting.\n\n\"Have  you ever seen Vienna from Old Steffel?\" A deep voice  came\nfrom  behind where Martin was seated.   He looked around and  saw\nit was Alex.\n\n\"Many  years  ago.  But I prefer the Prater.\"   He spoke  of  the\nfairgrounds  2  kilometers  from town where  the  world's  oldest\nFerris  Wheel offered an unparalleled view of the  Viennese  sur-\nrounds.   Templer smiled at his old ally from the  German  Bunde-\nposte.  Today though, Alex was an asset to the Agency, as he  had\nbeen  since he had gone freelance some years ago.   An  expensive\nasset, but always with quality information.\n\n\"Did  you know that St. Stephen's,\"  Alex gestured at the  pollu-\ntion  stained  church, \"is one of the finest examples  of  Gothic\narchitecture in Europe?  And Vienna's paradox?\"\n\nTempler had never been a history buff.  He shook his head.\n\n\"Most  of Vienna is Baroque, in fine fashion, but there are  iso-\nlated examples of Gothic.  Yet, they seem to coexist.  In peace.\"\nAlex's  poetic words rolled off of his well educated tongue.  The\nallegory  was not lost on Templer.  Western and Eastern  intelli-\ngence services used Vienna as a no-man's land, where  information\nand people were regularly exchanged.\n\n\"It is a new world,\" commented Templer.  \"The threats are differ-\nent.\"\n\nAlex took the hint.  \"Let us walk,\" he urged.\n\nThey slowly strolled up the Kartnerstrasse as the Austrian night-\nlife took on its own distinct flavor.\n\n\"How  long  has it been, my friend?\"  Alex  casually  asked.   He\ndisliked rushing into business, the way the Americans favored.\n\n\"Damned  if  I know.  4, 5, 6 years?  Too long.  We've  had  some\ngood times.\"\n\n\"'85, '86 was it?  So much travel blurs the senses.\"  Alex  wrin-\nkled  his  forehead in thought.  \"Wasn't it  the  Pelton  affair?\nYes,  that would be summer of '85.\"  He referred to  Ron  Pelton,\nthe  ex-NSA  analyst who sold American cryptographic  secrets  to\nthe Soviets.\n\n\"Yeah,\"   Templer laughed.  \"That poor jerk.  I'd  forgotten  all\nabout that.  Never would have caught on to the scam if it weren't\nfor  Slovnov.  The KGB should tell their own to stay out  of  the\nMoulin Rouge.  Not good for business.  Ivan had to trade  Slovnov\nfor  Pelton.   We  didn't find out for a year  that  they  wanted\nPelton out anyway.  He was too fucked up for them.\"\n\n\"And  now?   Who do you spy on since Sam and  Ivan  are  brothers\nagain?\"  Alex openly enjoyed speaking obliquely.\n\n\"Spy?  Ha!\"   Templer shook his head.  \"I  got  pushed  upstairs.\nInteragency  cooperation,  political  bullshit.  I  do  miss  the\nstreets though, and the friends  . . .on both sides.\"\n\n\"Don't  you  mean on all sides?\"  Cocktail  semantics  made  Alex\noccasionally annoying.\n\n\"No,  I mean both.  At least we had class; we knew the rules  and\nhow  to play.  Now every third rate country tries to stick  their\nnose in and they screw it up.  One big mess.\"  Templer had been a\nstaunch  anti-Communist  when there were Communists, but  he  re-\nspected  their  agents' highly professional  attitude,  and  yes,\nethics.\n\n\"Touch\u001b\u0002\n! I have missed our talks and our disagreements.  I  never\ncould  talk you into something you did not believe in, could  I?\"\nAlex slapped Templer lightly on his back.  Templer didn't answer.\n\"Ah, you look so serious.  You came  for business, not old  memo-\nries?\"\n\n\"No, Alex, I'd love to chat, and we will, but I do need to get  a\ncouple  of questions answered, and then, I can relax.  Perhaps  a\ntrip  to  Club 24?\"  Templer pointed at the bright  yellow  kiosk\nwith the silhouettes of naked women emblazoned on it.  For a mere\n$300, you can buy a bottle of Chevas Regal and share it with  one\nor  two  or more of the lovely skimpily clad ladies  who  adorned\nthe bar seats.  All else was negotiable in private.\n\n\"Done.   Let  us speak, now.  What can I do for you?\"   Alex  ap-\nproved of the plan.\n\n\"I need some information,\" Templer said seriously.\n\n\"That is my business, of course.\"\n\n\"We have a problem in the States . . .\"\n\n\"As usual,\" Alex interrupted.\n\n\"Yes,\"  Templer grinned, \"as usual.  But this one is  not  usual.\nSomeone, someone with connections, is apparently using  computers\nas a blackmail tool.  The FBI is investigating domestically, and,\nwell,  it's our job, to look outside.  So, I figure,  call  Alex.\nThat's why I'm here.\"\n\nAlex  disguised  his surprise.  How had they found him?   He  now\nneeded to find out what, if anything, they knew.\n\n\"Blackmail?  Computers?  That's not a lot to go on.\"  Alex  main-\ntained absolute composure.\n\n\"Here's what we know.  And it's not much.  There appears to be  a\nwholesale blackmail operation in place.  With the number of  com-\nplaints  we have gotten over the last few months, we could  guess\nthat  maybe 10, or 20 people, maybe more are  involved.   They're\nafter  the  big boys; the banks, some senators, folks  with  real\nmoney  and power.  And it's one professional job.  They  seem  to\nget  their  information from computers, from the  radiation  they\nemanate.  It's something we really want to keep quiet.\"\n\nAlex  listened  quietly.   If Templer was  being  straight,  they\ndidn't  know much, certainly not the scope of the  operation  nor\nAlex's  own involvement.  It was possible, though,  that  Templer\nwas  playing dumb, and trying to elicit clues from Alex.   If  he\nwas a suspect.\n\n\"What  sort of demands are being made?\"  Alex was going  to  play\nthe game to the hilt.\n\n\"None. Yet.\"\n\n\"After 2 months?  You say?  And no demands?  What kind of  black-\nmail   is  that?\"   Alex ineffectively stifled  a  laugh.   \"This\nsounds  like  some Washington paranoia.  \"You really  don't  know\nwhat to do without an adversary, so you create one,\" Alex  chuck-\nled.\n\n\"Alex,  c'mon.   No shit, we got some muckity  mucks  with  their\nheads  in  a tail spin and our asses in a sling.   I  don't  know\nwhat's  happening,  but, whatever it is, it's causing a  pile  of\nshit bigger than Congress and smellier.\"\n\n\"And  you  thought I might know something about it?\"   Alex  ven-\ntured.\n\n\"Well,  no, or yes, or maybe,\" Templer said coyly.  \"Who's got  a\ngrudge?   Against so many people?  And then, who's also  got  the\ntechnology  to  do it.  There must be a lot of smart  people  and\nmoney in on it.  You have the best ears in Europe.\"  The  compli-\nment might help.\n\n\"Thank you for the over-statement, but I have only a small  group\non  whom  I  can rely.  Certainly your own agency  can  find  out\nbefore I can.\"  Deniability and humility could raise the ante.\n\n\"We have our good days, but too many bad days.\" Templer was being\nsincere concluded Alex. \"Listen,  I need the streets.  If there's\nnothing,  then  there's nothing.  It could be  domestic,  but  it\nsmells of outside influence.  Can you help?\"\n\nAlex  stopped  to  light up a non-filtr  Gaulloise.   He  inhaled\ndeeply  as  his eyes scanned the clear sky.  He  wanted  to  have\nTempler think there might be something.\n\n\"How  much  is this information worth?\"   Alex  was  the  perfect\nmercenary, absolutely no allegiance to anyone other than himself.\n\n\"We have about fifty grand for good info.  But for that price, it\nhad better be good.\"\n\nAlex had to laugh to himself at the American's naivete.  Homosoto\nwas  paying him a hundred times that for one job.  Being a  free-\nlancer  means treating all customers as equals, and there was  no\nway he would jeopardize his planned retirement for a cause or for\na friend.  This would be easy.\n\n\"Phew!\"  Alex whistled.  \"Hot off the griddle, huh? I'll see  who\nknows what.  It may take a while, a week, ten days, but I'll  get\nback to you with anything I find.  No promises, though.\"\n\n\"I  know it's a long shot, but we have to look at all angles.   I\nreally  appreciate it.\"  Templer sounded relieved.  He  had  just\nrecruited,  for no money down, the best source of information  in\nEurope.  \"Let's go have a bottle of Chevas.  On me.\"  The  Ameri-\ncan  taxpayer was about to pay for the sexual relief of a  merce-\nnary enemy.\n\nAlex made it home at 4:00 A.M. after the romp in Club 24. Or  was\nit  Club  1?  He no longer knew, no cared.  Despite  his  intense\nintoxication, he had to talk to his employer.  Somehow he managed\nto  get his computer alive.  He dialed the number in  Tokyo,  not\nknowing whether Homosoto would be in the office.\n\n     ENTER PASSWORD\n     ENTER CRYPT KEY\n\nHe  responded  to both, nearly blinded from the Chevas,  yet  his\nprofessionalism demanded that he make immediate contact if possi-\nble.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION>>>>>>\n\nAlex  missed the message for several seconds before forcing  him-\nself  alert.   He quickly entered his opening  words  before  the\nconnection would shut down.\n\nI have been contacted.\n\nHomosoto  apparently  never went home. He got  an  immediate  re-\nsponse.\n\nBY WHOM\n\nThe CIA\n\nThe  screen  paused for several seconds.  Alex was too  drunk  to\nnotice.\n\nHOW?\n\nAn old frrrriend. He called for a meeeeeeting.\n\nWHAT DID HE WANT?\n\nHe asked about the US operations.\n\nHOW MUCH DOES HE KNOW?\n\nThey kkknnow about the blackmail.   But,  they're\nfishing\n\nFISH\n\nLooking for answers.  They know nothing.\n\nTELL ME MORE.  I AM NOT HAPPY.\n\nThe  FBI is looking for an answer, who is behind the  propaganda.\nThey think it is very important, take it seriously.  They brought\nin the CIA and, probably, the NSA.  The effect is beginning.   We\nshould be pleased.\n\nAND THE PRESS?  IS IT IN THE PAPERS?\n\nNo, it was suppressed.  The Government still controls the press.\n\nAND YOU.  WHY CONTACT YOU?\n\nThe same reason you did.  It  is pure coincidence.\n\nI AM NOT CONVINCED.\n\nAn  old friend, a colleague, called for a meeting.  He asked  for\nmy help.  He tried to hire me to find out if it was foreign.\n\nWHAT DID YOU SAY?\n\nI told him the streets, the rumors, know nothing.  That is  true.\nHe never suspected me.  I was surprised.  He offered me money  to\ngive him information.\n\nHOW MUCH MONEY?\n\n$50,000 US\n\nI PAY YOU A THOUSAND TIMES THAT\n\nNo, only 100 times.\n\nDOES IT MATTER?\n\nOnly if they equal your money.\n\nMAKE SURE THEY DO NOT.  IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR LIFE.\n\nThe  CIA does not have that kind of money.  That is why the  Rus-\nsians learned so much for so little.  The US does not think  they\nshould pay to keep their secrets.\n\nTHEY ARE WRONG.  WE CALL IT INSURANCE.\n\nThey call it blackmail.  They do not have the funds.\n\nWHAT WILL YOU TELL THEM?\n\nI  will tell them that it is not from here.  No, it must be  from\nthe  US.   They  will believe me.  I will charge  them  for  that\ninformation.\n\nAND THEY WILL BELIEVE YOU?\n\nIf I make them pay, yes.  If I give it for free, no.  That's  the\nAmerican  way.   They will believe what is  easiest  to  believe.\nThey do not know that this is my last job.  They cannot know.  If\nthey think  that, they will suspect me.  And then, you.\n\nWHY ME?\n\nThey will use drugs I cannot resist.  So, I must make sure I help\nthem.\n\nAND IF THEY OFFER MONEY.  AS MUCH AS I DO?\n\nThen we negotiate.\n\nTHEN YOU WILL DIE.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 16\n\n     Wednesday, December 9\n     New York\n\nThe  late afternoon pace of the City Room at the Times tended  to\nbe  chaotic.  As deadlines approached and the paper was laid  out\nfor  the printers, the flurry of activity was associated with  an\nincrease in the loudness of the room.   Scott Mason listened with\none  hand over his right ear and the phone so  awkwardly  pressed\nbetween  his left ear and shoulder that his glasses sat askew  on\nhis  face. Suddenly hanging up the phone, Scott sprung up  shout-\ning,  \"I  got  it.\"   Several people stopped and  stared  in  his\ndirection,  but  seeing nothing of concern or interest  to  them,\nthey returned to their own world.\n\nScott  ripped a page from a notebook and ran into and around  his\nco-workers.  \"Doug, I got it. Confirmed by the President.\"\n\n\"You're  kidding  me?\" Doug stopped his  red  pencil  mid-stroke.\n\"Give  it to me from the top.\"  He turned in his swivel chair  to\nface Scott more directly.\n\n\"It  goes like this.  A few weeks ago Sovereign Bank  in  Atlanta\nfound  that someone had entered their central  computers  without\npermission.\"  Scott perused his notes.  \"It didn't take long  for\nthem to find the intruder.  He left a calling card.  It said that\nthe  hackers  had found a hole to crawl through  undetected  into\ntheir  computers.  Was the bank interested in knowing how it  was\ndone?  They left a Compuserve Mail Box.\n\n\"As you can imagine the bank freaked out and told their  computer\npeople  to fix whatever it was.  They called in the  FBI,  that's\nfrom my contact, and went on an internal rampage.  Those good ol'\nboys don't trust nobody,\" Scott added sounding like a poor imita-\ntion of Andy from Mayberry.\n\n\"Anybody  that could spell computer was suspect and  they  turned\nthe place upside down.  Found grass, cocaine, ludes, a couple  of\nweapons  and  a lot of people got fired.  But no  state  secrets.\nYou  talk  about a dictatorship,\" commented Scott  on  the  side.\n\"There's  no privacy at all.  They scanned everyone's  electronic\nmail  boxes looking for clues and instead found them  staring  at\ninvasion  of  privacy suits from employees and  ex-employees  who\nwere fired because of the contents of their private mail.\n\n\"The  computer jocks unplugged the computers, turned them  inside\nout  and  screwed them back together.  Nothing. They found  nada.\nSo  they tighten the reins and give away less passwords, to  less\npeople.  That's all they figured they could do.\"\n\n\"This is where the fun starts.\"  Scott actively gestured with his\nhands as he shifted weight to his other foot.  \"A few days  later\nthey discover another message in their computer.  Says  something\nlike,  'sorry Charlie' or something to that effect.  The  hackers\nwere  back.  And this time they wanted to sell their services  to\nthe  bank.  For a nominal fee, say, a million bucks,  we'll  show\nyou how to sew up the holes.\"\n\n\"Well, what does that sound like to you?\" Scott asked Doug.\n\n\"Extortion.\"\n\n\"Exactly,  and ape-shit doesn't begin to describe what  the  bank\ndid.  Bottom  line?  They made a deal.  We'll pay you  a  million\nbucks as consultants for 10 years.  You agree to stay out of  the\nmachines  unless  we  need you.  Immunity unless  you  break  the\ndeal.\"\n\n\"What happened?\" Doug said with rapt attention.\n\n\"Sovereign bank now has three fourteen year old consultants at  a\nhundred  grand a year,\" Scott said choking with laughter  on  his\nwords.\n\n\"You're kidding,\" exclaimed Doug slapping his knees.\n\n\"No shit.  And everyone is pretty happy about it.  The kids  have\na way to pay for a good college, they're bright little snots, and\nthey get off.  The bank figures it's making an investment in  the\nfuture  and actually may have gotten off cheap.  It woke them  up\nto  the problems they could face if their computers did  go  down\nfor  a month.  Or if they lost all their records.  Or if  someone\nreally  wanted to do damage.  Thoughts like that trigger a  panic\nattack in any bank exec.  They'd rather deal with the kids.\n\n\"In  fact, they're turning it into a public relations coup.   Dig\nthis,\" Scott knew the story like the back of his hand.  \"The bank\nrealized that they could fix their security problems for a couple\nof million bucks.  Not much of an investment when you're guarding\nbillions.   So  they design a new ad  campaign:  Sovereign.   The\nSafest Your Money Can Be.\"\n\n\"Now  that's  a story,\" said Doug approvingly.  \"Important,  fun,\nhuman,  and everyone comes out a winner.  A story with  a  moral.\nConfirmed?\"\n\n\"Every  bit.  From the president.  They announce it all  tomorrow\nand we print tonight with their blessing. Exclusive.\"\n\n\"Why?  What did you have to do . . ?\"\n\n\"Nothing.   He  likes the work we've been doing on  the  computer\ncapers  and crime and all and thought that we would give it  fair\ncoverage.  I think they're handling it like absolute gentlemen.\"\n\n\"How fast do you type?\"\n\n\"Forty mistakes a minute.  Why?\"\n\n\"You got 40 minutes to deadline.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday, December 11\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nThroughout his years of Government service at the National  Secu-\nrity Agency, Miles Foster had become a nine to fiver.  Rarely did\nhe  work in the evening or on weekends. So the oddball  hours  he\nhad to work during his association with Homosoto were  irritating\nand  made him cranky. He could function well enough, and  cranki-\nness was difficult to convey over a computer terminal, but  work-\ning  nights  wasn't much to his liking.  It interfered  with  his\nsocial responsibilities to the women.\n\nThe master plan Miles had designed years ago for Homosoto was now\ncalling  for phase two to go into effect.  The beauty of it  all,\nthought Miles, was that it was unstoppable.  The pieces had  been\nput  into play by scores of people who worked\u000ffor him;  the  pro-\ngrammers,  the Freedom League BBS's and the infectors.  Too  much\nhad  already gone into play to abort the mission.  There  was  no\npulling back.\n\nOnly a few weeks were left before the first strike force  landed.\nThe  militaristic  thinking kept Miles focussed on  the  task  at\nhand, far away from any of the personalization that might surface\nif he got down to thinking about the kinds of damage he was going\nto be inflicting on millions of innocent targets. Inside, perhaps\ndeep  inside, Miles cared, but he seemed to only be aware of  the\ntechnical  results  of his efforts in distinction  to  the  human\nelement.   The human elements of frustration,  depression,  help-\nlessness - a social retreat of maybe fifty years, that was  going\nto be the real devastation above and beyond the machinery.   Just\nthe way Homosoto wanted it.  To hurt deep down.\n\nMiles had come to learn of the intense hatred that Homosoto  felt\ntoward the United States.  In his more callous moments, especial-\nly when he and Homosoto were at odds over any particular subject,\nMiles would resort to the basest of verbal tactics.\n\n\"You're  just  pissed off 'cause we nuked your family.\"   It  was\nmeant  to  sting  and Homosoto's  reactions  were  unpredictable.\nOften violent, he had once thrown priceless heirlooms across  his\noffice  shattering  in a thousand shards. A  three  hour  lecture\nensued  on one occasion, tutoring Miles about honorable  warfare.\nMiles listened and fell asleep during more than one sermon.\n\nBut at the bottom of it, Homosoto kept a level head and showed he\nknew  what he was doing.  The plans they formulated  were  coming\ntogether though Miles had no direct control over many pieces. The\nReaders  were  run by another group altogether; Miles  only  knew\nthey were fundamentalist fanatics.  He didn't really care as long\nas  the  job was getting done.  And the groundhogs;  he  designed\nthem, but they were managed by others.  Propaganda, yet  another,\njust as the plan called for.  Extreme compartmentalization,  even\nat the highest level.\n\nOnly  Homosoto knew all the players and therefore had the  unique\nluxury  of  viewing the grand game being  played.   Though  Miles\ndesigned  every nuance, down to the nth degree of how  to  effect\nthe invasion properly, he was not privileged to push the chessmen\naround the board.  His rationalization was that he was being paid\na great deal of money for the job, and he was working for a  more\nimportant  cause, one that would make it all worthwhile.  Perhaps\nin  another year or two when the final phases were complete,  and\nthe  United States was even more exposed and defenseless than  it\nwas right now, the job would be done.\n\nMiles' ruminating provided a calming influence during the  inter-\nminable months and years that distanced the cause and effect.  In\nthe  intelligence game, on the level that he had  operated  while\nwith  the  NSA, he would receive information,  process  it,  make\nrecommendation  and  determinations, and that  was  that.   Over.\nNext.\n\nNow  though, Miles had designed the big picture, and  that  meant\nlong  range planning.  No more instant gratification.  He was  in\ncontrol, only partially, as he was meant to be.  He was impressed\nwith  the operation. That nothing had gone awry so  far  consoled\nMiles despite the fact that Homosoto called him almost every  day\nto ask about another computer crime he had heard about.\n\nThis time is was Sovereign Bank.  Homosoto had heard rumors  that\nthey  were being held hostage by hackers and was  concerned  that\nsome of Miles' techies had gone out on their own.\n\nHomosoto  reacted  to the Sovereign issue as he had  many  others\nthat he seemed so concerned about.  Once Miles gave him an expla-\nnation, he let the matter drop.  Not without an appropriate warn-\ning to Miles, though,  that he had better be right.\n\nThe  number of computer crimes was increasing more  rapidly  than\nMiles  or anyone in the security field had predicted only  a  few\nyears  ago  and the legal issues were mounting  faster  than  the\nstate  or  federal legislatures could deal with  them.   But,  as\nMiles continually reassured Homosoto, they were small timers with\nno heinous motivation.  They were mostly kids who played  chicken\nwith  computers instead of chasing cars or smoking crack.  A  far\nbetter alternative, Miles offered.\n\nJust  kids having a little fun with the country's most  important\ncomputer systems.  No big deal.  Right?  How anyone can leave the\nfront door to their computer open, or with the keys lying around,\nwas beyond him. Fucking stupid.\n\nHis  stream of consciousness was broken when his NipCom  computer\nannounced that Homosoto was calling. Again. Shit. I bet some high\nschool  kids changed their school grades and Homosoto thinks  the\nRosenburgs are behind it.  Paranoid gook.\n\n     <<<<<<TRANSMISSION ENCRYPTED>>>>>>\n\nMR FOSTER\n\nThat's me.

The one week holiday had been good  for\nSir George.  Well earned, he thought.  In less than 3 months,  he\nhad called over 1,700 people on the phone and let them in on  his\nlittle secrets, as he came to call them.\n\nEvery month Alex had forwarded money, regular like clockwork, and\nSir George had diligently followed instructions.  To the  letter.\nNot  so much in deference to the implicit threats issued  him  by\nAlex,  over computer and untraceable of course, but by the  pros-\npect  of continued income.  He came to enjoy the work.  Since  he\nwas in America and his calls were to Americans, he had the oppor-\ntunity  to dazzle them with his proper and refined accent  before\nhe  let the hammer down with whatever tidbit of private  informa-\ntion he was told to share with them.\n\nIn  the beginning Sir George had little idea of what the  motiva-\ntion  behind his job was, and still, he wasn't  completely  sure.\nHe  realized  each call he made contained the undercurrent  of  a\nthreat.   But he never threatened anyone, his  instructions  were\nexplicit;  never  threaten.  So therefore, he reasoned,  he  must\nactually be making threats, no matter how veiled.\n\nHe  rather enjoyed it all.  Not hurting people, that  wasn't  his\nnature,  but he savored impressing people with his knowledge  and\nnoting their reactions for his daily reports back to Alex. In the\nevenings  Sir  George searched out  small  American  recreational\ncenters  inaccurately  referred to as pubs.  In  fact  they  were\ndisguised  bars with darts and warm beer, but it gave Sir  George\nthe chance to mingle and flash his assumed pedigree.  When  asked\nwhat he did for a living, he truthfully said, \"I talk to people.\"\nAbout what?  \"Whatever interests them.\"\n\nHe  became somewhat of a celebrated fixture at several 'pubs'  in\nMarin County where he found the atmosphere more to his liking;  a\nperfectly civilized provincial suburb of San Francisco where  his\npurchased  affectations  wore well on the  locals  who  endlessly\ncommuted  to their high tech jobs in Silicon Valley 40  miles  to\nthe south.\n\nHawaii  had been, as he said, \"Quite the experience.\"   Alex  had\ninformed  him  one day that he was to take a holiday  and  return\nready  for  a  new assignment, one to which now  he  was  ideally\nsuited.   Sir  George smiled to himself.  A job  well  done,  and\nadditional  rewards.  That was a first for George Toft of  dreary\nManchester, England.\n\nSince he did not have a printer, there was no way he would  jeop-\nardize his livelihood for a comfort so small, he read his  E-Mail\nby copying the messages into Word Perfect, and then reading  them\nat his leisure.  All E-Mail was encrypted with the Public Private\nRSA  algorithm, so he had to manually decrypt the  messages  with\nhis private key and save them unencrypted.  When he was done,  he\nerased the file completely, to keep anyone else from  discovering\nthe nature of his work.  Alex's first message was dated two  days\nbefore he returned from Hawaii.  It was actually cordial, as  far\nas Alex  could be considered cordial.  After their first  meeting\nin Athens, Alex had taken on a succinct if not terse tone in  all\ncommunications.\n\nSir George:\n\nWelcome  back.  I hope you had a most enjoyable holiday.  It  was\nwell deserved.\n\nWe now enter phase two of our operations.  We place much faith in\nyour ability and loyalty.  Please do not disrupt that confidence.\n\nAs in the past, you will be given daily lists  of\npeople to call.  They are some of the people whom you have called\nbefore.   As  before, identify yourself and the  nature  of  your\ncall.   I am sure your last call was so disturbing to them,  they\nwill take your call this time as well.\n\n Then, once you have confirmed  their  identity,\ngive  them the new information provided, and ask them  to  follow\nthe  instructions  given, to the letter.  Please  be  your  usual\npolite self.\n\nAlex\n\nThe second message was more Alex-like:\n\n     Sir George:\n\n     If  you have any problems with your new  assignment,  please\n     call me to arrange your termination.\n\n     Alex.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Hello?  Are you there?\" Sir George Sterling spoke with  as  much\nelegance he could muster.  \"This is John Fullmaster calling again\nfor  Robert Henson.\"  Sir George remembered the name but not  the\nspecifics.\n\n\"One moment please,\" Maggie said.  \"Mr. Henson?\"  She said  after\ndialing  his intercom extension. \"It's John Fullmaster  for  you.\nLine three\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Mr.  Fullmaster.  He called once several months ago.  Don't  you\nremember?\"   He thought.  Fullmaster.  Fullmaster.  Oh,  shit.  I\nthought  he  was a bad dream.  Goddamn  blackmailer.   Never  did\nfigure  how  he knew about the Winston Ellis  scam.   Good  thing\nthat's been put to bed and over.\n\n\"All  right,  I'll  take  it.\"  He punched  up  the  third  line.\n\"Yeah?\"  He said defiantly.\n\n\"Mr.  Henson?   This is John Fullmaster.  I believe  we  spoke  a\nwhile back about some of your dealings?  Do you recall?\"\n\n\"Yes, I recall you bastard, but you're too late.  The deal closed\nlast month.  So you can forget your threats.  Fuck off and  die.\"\nHenson used his best boardroom belligerence.\n\n\"Oh,  I  am sorry that you thought I was threatening you,  I  can\nassure you I wasn't.\"  Sir George oozed politeness.\n\n\"Bullshit.   I  don't know how the blazes  you  learned  anything\nabout my business, and I don't really care . . .\"\n\n\"I think you might care, sir, if you will allow me to speak for a\nmoment.\"  Sir George interjected.  The sudden interruption caught\nHenson off guard.  He stood his ground in silence.\n\n\"Thank  you.\"   Sir George waited for  an  acknowledgement  which\nnever  arrived, so he continued. \"Winston Ellis is old news,  Mr.\nHenson, very old news.  I read today, though, that Miller Pharma-\nceuticals is about to have its Anti-AIDS drug turned down by  the\nFDA.   Apparently it still has too many side effects and  may  be\ntoo  dangerous  for  humans.  I'm sure you've  read  the  reports\nyourself. Don't you think it would be wise to tell your investors\nbefore  they  sink another $300 Million into a  black  hole  from\nwhich  there  is  no escape?\"  The  aristocratic  British  accent\nsoftened  the  harshness of the words, but not the auger  of  the\nmeaning.\n\nHenson  seethed.  \"I don't know who you are,\" he hissed,  \"but  I\nwill  not  listen  to  this  kind  of  crap.   I  won't  take  it\nfrom . . .\"\n\n\"Sorry,\"  Sir George again interrupted, \"but I'm afraid you  will\nlisten.   The instructions are as follows.  I want $5 Million  in\nsmall  bills in a silver Samsonite case to be placed into  locker\nnumber  235 at Grand Central Station, first level.  You  have  48\nhours  to  comply. If you do not have the money  there,  we  will\nrelease  these  findings to the media and the SEC which  will  no\ndoubt  prompt an investigation into this and other of your  deal-\nings.  Don't you think?\"\n\nBlackmail was anathema to Robert Henson, although he should  have\nfelt  quite  comfortable in its milieu.  It was  effectively  the\nsame stunt he performed on many of his investors.  Nobody  treats\nRobert  Henson this way, nobody.  He needed time to  think.   The\nlast  time Fullmaster called it was a bluff, obviously, but  then\nthere were no demands.  This time, he wanted something.  But, how\ndid  he  know?  The FDA reports were still confidential,  and  he\nhoped  to  have completed raising the funds  before  the  reports\nbecame public, another few weeks at most.  He counted on  ineffi-\ncient  government bureaucracy and indifference to delay  any  an-\nnouncement.   Meanwhile though, he would pocket several  millions\nin banking fees.\n\n\"You got me.  I'll do it.  235. Right?\"\n\n\"Very good, Mr. Henson.  I'm glad you see it my way.  It has been\na  pleasure doing business with you.\"  Sir George sounded like  a\nused  car salesman. \"Oh, yes, I almost forgot.  Please, Mr.  Hen-\nson, no police.  In that case, our deal is off.\"\n\n\"Of  course,  no  police.  No problem.   Thanks  for  the  call.\"\nHenson hung up.  Fuck him.  No money, no way.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Mr. Faulkner, this is John Fullmaster.\"  Sir George was  sicken-\ningly sweet.  \"Do you recall our last conversation?\"\n\nHow  couldn't he?  This was the only call he had received on  his\nprivate line since that maniac had last called.  Faulkner had had\nthe  number  changed at least a half a dozen times  since,  as  a\nmatter  of  course, but still, Fullmaster, if that was  his  real\nname, reached him with apparent ease.\n\n\"Yes, I remember,\" he said tersely.  \"What do you want now?\"\n\n\"Just a piece of the action, Mr. Faulkner.\"\n\n\"What the hell does that mean?\"\n\n\"Well,  according  to my records, you have lost quite  a  sum  of\nmoney since our last conversation, and it would be such a  shame,\ndon't you agree, if California National Bank found out they  lost\nanother $2 million to your bad habits?\"  Sir George instinctively\nthought Faulkner was a California slime ball, never mind his  own\nactions, and he briefly thought that he might actually be   work-\ning for the side of good after all.\n\n\"You  have  a real doctor's bedside manner.  What do  you  want?\"\nFaulkner conveyed extreme nervousness.\n\n\"I  think,  under the circumstances that, shall we say,  oh,  one\nmillion would do it.  Yes, that sounds fair.\"\n\n\"One  million? One million dollars?\" Faulkner shrieked  from  his\npool side lounge chair.\n\n\"Yessir,  that sounds just about right.\"  Sir George  paused  for\neffect.   \"Now here is what I want you to do.  Go to  Las  Vegas,\nand  have your credit extended, and acquire small  bills.   Then,\nplace  the  money in a silver Samsonite case  at  Union  Station.\nLocker number 12.  Is that simple enough?\"  British humor at  its\nbest.\n\n\"Simple, yes. Possible, no,\" Faulkner whispered in terror.\n\n\"Oh,  yes, it is possible, as you well know.  You cleared up  the\n$2.4  Million you owed Caesar's only last week.  Your  credit  is\nexcellent.\"\n\n\"There's  no  way you can know that . . .\"  Then it  occurred  to\nhim.   The  mob.   He wasn't losing enough at  the  tables,  they\nwanted  more.   Losing money was one thing, his way, but  a  sore\nwinner is the worst possible enemy.  He had no choice.  There was\nonly one way out.\n\n\"All right, all right.  What locker number?\"\n\n\"Twelve.   Within 48 hours.  And, I probably needn't mention  it,\nbut no police.\"\n\n\"Of  course,\" Faulkner smiled to himself.  At last the  nightmare\nwould be over.\n\n\"Thank you so very much.  Have a nice day.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Merrill!  It's the blackmailer again. Merrill, do you hear  me?\"\nKen Boyers tried to get Senator Rickfield out from the centerfold\nof the newest Playboy.  \"Merrill!\"\n\n\"Oh  sorry,  Ken.  Just reading the articles.  Now what  is  it?\"\nRickfield  put  the magazine down, slowly, for one  last  lustful\ngaze.\n\n\"Merrill,  that Fullmaster fellow, the one who called  about  the\nCredite Suisse arrangements . . .\"\n\n\"Shut  up!   We don't talk about that in this  office,  you  know\nthat!\"  Rickfield admonished Ken.\n\n\"I know, but he doesn't,\" he said, pointing at the blinking light\non the Senator's desk phone.\n\n\"I thought he went away.  Nothing ever came of it, did it?\"\n\n\"No,  nothing,  after we got General Young onto it,\"  Boyers  ex-\nplained.  \"I  thought he took care of it, in his  own  way.   The\nproblem just disappeared like it was supposed  to.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Rickfield said scornfully, \"obviously it didn't.  Give me\nthe  goddamned phone.\"  He picked it up and pressed  the  lighted\nbutton.  His senatorial dignity was absent as he spoke.\n\n\"This is Rickfield.  Who is this?\"\n\n\"Ah, thank you for taking my call.  Yes, thank you.\"  Sir  George\nspoke  slowly, more slowly than necessary.  This call was  marked\ncritical.   That  meant,  don't screw it up.  \"My  name  is  John\nFullmaster  and  I believe we spoke about some  arrangements  you\nmade with General Young and Credite Suisse.\"\n\n\"I  remember.  So what?  That has nothing to do with me,\"   Rick-\nfield  retorted.  He grabbed a pen and wrote down the name,  John\nFullmaster.  Ken looked at the scribbled writing and shrugged his\nshoulders.\n\n\"Ah,  but  I'm afraid it does.  I see here that  Allied  Dynamics\nrecently made a significant contribution to a certain account  in\nCredite  Suisse.  There are only two signators on  the  passbook.\nIt also says here that they will be building two new factories in\nyour  state.  Quite an accomplishment.  I am sure your  constitu-\nents would be proud.\"\n\nThe  color drained from Rickfield's face.  He put his  hand  over\nthe  mouthpiece  to  speak privately to Ken.   \"Who  else  knows?\nDon't bullshit me, boy.  Who else have you told?\"\n\n\"No  one!\"  Boyers said in genuine shock.  \"I want to  enjoy  the\nmoney, not pay attorney's fees.\"\n\nRickfield  waved  Boyers away.  He appeared  satisfied  with  the\nresponse.   \"This  is  speculation.  You can't  prove  a  thing.\"\nRickfield took a shot to gauge his opponent.\n\n\"Believe  that if you wish, Senator, but I don't think it  is  in\neither  of  our best interests to play the other for  the  fool.\"\nSir  George  saw that Rickfield did not attain  his  position  as\nChairman  of  the Senate Committee on Space,  Transportation  and\nTechnology by caving in to idle demands or threats.  In fact,  in\n34  years of Senate service, Senator Merrill Rickfield  had  sur-\nvived  8 presidents, counseling most of them to  varying  degrees\ndepending upon the partisan attitude of the White House.\n\nAt  65,  much of the private sector would have  forced  him  into\nretirement,  but  elected Government service  permitted  him  the\ntenure  to continue as long as his constituents allowed.   Claude\nPepper  held  the record and Merrill Rickfield's  ego  wanted  to\nestablish new definitions of tenure.\n\nHis involvement with General Chester Oliver Young was recent,  in\npolitical terms; less than a decade.  During the Reagan  military\nbuildup,  nearly  3 trillion dollars worth,  defense  contractors\nexpanded  with the economy, to unprecedented levels and  profits.\nCongress was convinced that $300 Billion per year was about right\nto  defend  against a Cold War enemy that couldn't feed  its  own\npeople.   The overestimates of the CIA, with selective and  often\nspeculative  information provided by the  country's  intelligence\ngatherer, the NSA, helped define a decade of political and  tech-\nnological achievements:  Star Wars, Stealth, MX, B1, B2 and other\nassorted toys that had no practical use save all out war.\n\nWith that kind of spending occurring freely, and the Senate Over-\nsight  Committee in a perpetual state of the doldrums, there  was\nmoney  to  be made for anyone part of Washington's good  ol'  boy\nnetwork.  General Young was one such an opportunistic militarist.\nPromoted  to one star general in 1978, after two  lackluster  but\npolitically  well connected tours in Vietnam, it was deemed  pru-\ndent  by  the power brokers of that war to bring Young  into  the\ninner  rings of the Pentagon with the corresponding perks such  a\nposition brought.  But Young had bigger and better ideas.\n\nHe  saw countless ways to spend taxpayers money  protecting  them\nfrom the Communist threat of the Evil Empire, but had  difficulty\ngetting support from his two and three star superiors.  It didn't\ntake him long to realize that he had been token promoted to  keep\nhis  mouth  shut about certain prominent people's  roles  in  the\nVietnam  era.   Events  that were better left to  a  few  trusted\nmemories than to the history books.\n\nSo  Young decided to go out on his own and find support from  the\nlegislative  branch;  find  an influential proponent  for  a  few\nspecific  defense  programs by which he could profit.   Over  the\ncourse  of  a  few years, he and Senator  Rickfield  became  fast\nfriends, holding many of the same global views and fears, if  not\nparanoias.   When  Allied  Dynamics  began  losing  Congressional\nsupport  for  an advanced jet helicopter project, Young  went  to\nRickfield  for  help.   After all, Allied  was  headquartered  in\nRickfield's  home state, and wouldn't it be a great boon  to  the\neconomy?  The recession was coming to an end and that meant jobs.\n\nRickfield was unaware, initially, that Allied had an  arrangement\nwith General Young to donate certain moneys to certain charities,\nin certain Swiss bank accounts if certain spending programs  were\napproved.   Only when Rickfield offered some later resistance  to\nthe Allied projects did Young feel the need to share the  wealth.\nAfter  25  years in Congress, and very little money put  away  to\nshow for it, Rickfield was an easy target.\n\nRickfield's recruitment by Young, on Allied's behalf, had yielded\nthe Senator more than enough to retire comfortably on the  island\nparadise  of  his choice.  Yet, Rickfield found  an  uncontrolled\ndesire  for more; considerations was his word for it, just as  he\nhad  grown used to wielding power and influence in  the  nation's\ncapital.   Rickfield was hooked, and Credite Suisse was the  cer-\ntain  Swiss bank in question.  Ken Boyers was involved  as  well,\nalmost from the start.  They both had a lot to lose.\n\n\"No, I must assume that you are not a fool, and I know for a fact\nI  am  not  one, so on that one point we  do  agree.\"   Political\npausing  often allowed your opponent to hang himself  with  addi-\ntional oration.   Rickfield found the technique useful, especial-\nly on novices.  \"Please continue.\"\n\n\"Thank  you.\" Sir George said with a hint of patronization.   \"To\nbe  brief, Senator, I want you to keep your money, I  think  that\ndedicated civil servants like yourself are grossly underpaid  and\nunderappreciated.   No sir, I do not wish to deny you the  chance\nto  make  your golden years pleasant after such  a  distinguished\ncareer.\"\n\n\"Then  what is it.  What do you want from me?\"  The  Senator  was\ndoodling nervously while Ken paced the room trying to figure  out\nwhat was being said at the other end of the phone.\n\n\"I'm glad you asked,\" said Sir George.  \"Beginning next month you\nare  chairing  a  sub-committee that will  be  investigating  the\nweaknesses and potential threats to government computer  systems.\nAs  I  remember it is called the Senate Select  Sub-Committee  on\nPrivacy and Technology Containment.  Is that right?\"\n\n\"Yes, the dates aren't firm yet, and I haven't decided if I  will\nchair the hearings or assign it to another committee member.   So\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Well,  we  want you to drag down the  hearings.  Nothing  more.\"\nSire George stated his intention as a matter of fact rather  than\na request.\n\nRickfield's  face  contorted in confusion. \"Drag  down?   Exactly\nwhat does that mean, to you, that is?\"\n\n\"We  want you to downplay the importance of security for  govern-\nment  computers.   That there really is no threat  to  them,  and\nthat government has already met all of its obligations in balance\nwith  the  new world order, if you will.  The  threats  are  mere\nscare  tactics by various special interest groups and  government\nagencies who are striving for long term self preservation.\"   Sir\nGeorge  had practiced his soliloquy before calling Senator  Rick-\nfield.\n\n\"What  the  hell for?\"  Rickfield raised his  voice.   \"Security?\nBig deal!  What's it to you?\"\n\n\"I am not at liberty to discuss our reasons.   Suffice it to say,\nthat we would be most pleased if you see to it that the  hearings\nhave minimal substance and that no direct action items are deliv-\nered.   I  believe that term you Americans so eloquently  use  is\nstonewall, or perhaps filibuster?\"\n\n\"They're not the same things.\"\n\n\"Fine, but you do understand nonetheless.  We want these hearings\nto epitomize the rest of American politics with  procrastination,\nobfuscation  and  procedural  gerrymandering.\"   Sir  George  had\nlearned quite a bit about the political system since he had moved\nto the States.\n\n\"And  to what aim?\"  Rickfield's political sense was  waving  red\nflags.\n\n\"That's it.  Nothing more.\"\n\n\"And  in return?\"  The Senator had learned to be direct in   mat-\nters  of additional compensation since he had hooked up with  the\nearthy General.\n\n\"I  will  assure you that the details of your  arrangements  with\nAllied Dynamics will remain safe with me.\"\n\n\"Until the next time, right?  This is blackmail?\"\n\n\"No.  Yes.\"   Sir George answered.  \"Yes, it  is  blackmail,  but\nwithout the usual messiness.  And no, there will be no next time.\nFor, as soon as the hearings are over, it would be most advisable\nfor  you to take leave of your position and enjoy the  money  you\nhave earned outside of your paycheck.\"\n\n\"And,  if I don't agree to this?\"  Rickfield was looking  at  his\noptions which seemed to be somewhere between few and none.  Maybe\nhe only had one.\n\n\"That  would be so unfortunate.\" Sir George smiled as  he  spoke.\n\"The  media will receive  a two page letter, it is  already  pre-\npared I can assure you, detailing your illegal involvements  with\nAllied, General Young and Mr. Boyers.\"\n\n\"What's in it for you?  You don't want any money?\"  The confusion\nin Rickfield's mind was terribly obvious, and he was sliding on a\nlogical Mobius loop.\n\n\"No Senator, no money.  Merely a favor.\"\n\n\"I will let you know what I decide.  May I have your number?\"\n\n\"I do not need to contact you again.  Your answer will be evident\nwhen  the  hearings begin.  Whatever course you pursue,  we  will\nmake an appropriate response.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Scott!\"  A woman called across the noisy floor.  \"Is your  phone\noff the hook?\"\n\n\"Yeah,  why?\"  He looked up and couldn't match the voice  with  a\nperson.\n\n\"You gotta call.\"\n\n\"Who is it? I'm busy.\"\n\n\"Some  guy from Brooklyn sounds like.  Says he got a package  for\nyou?\"\n\nHoly  shit.  It's Vito!  Scott's anonymous caller.  The  one  who\nhad caused him so much work, so much research without being  able\nto print one damn thing.\n\nNot yet.\n\n\"Yeah,  OK.  It's back on.\"  The phone rang instantly  and  Scott\nrushed to pick it up on the first ring.\n\n\"Yeah, Scott Mason here.\"  He sounded hurried.\n\n\"Yo!   Scott.   It's  me, your friend, rememba?\"   No  one  could\nforget the accent that sounded more fake than real.  He had  been\nnicknamed Vito for reference purposes by Scott.\n\n\"Sure  do, fella,\" Scott said cheerily.  \"That bunch of shit  you\nsent me was worthless.  Garbage.\"\n\n\"Yeah,  well,  we may have fucked up a little  on  that.   Didn't\ncount on youse guys having much in the ethics department if youse\nknow what I mean.\"  Vito laughed at what he thought was a  pretty\ngood  joke. \"So, we all screw up, right?  Now and  again?   Never\nmind  that,  I got something real good,  something  youse  really\ngonna like.\"\n\n\"Sure you do.\"\n\n\"No, really, dig this.  I gotta list of names that . . . \"\n\n\"Great another list.  Just what I need.  Another list.\"\n\n\"Whad'ar'ya,  a  wise guy?  Youse wanna talk or  listen?\"   Scott\ndidn't  answer.   \"That's better, cause youse  gonna  like  this.\nSome  guy  named  Faulkner, big shit banker from La  La  Land  is\nborrowing  money from the mob to pay off a blackmailer.   Another\nguy, right here in New York Shitty, a Wall Street big shot called\nHenson, him too.  Another one named Dobbs, same thing.  All being\nblackballed by the same guys. Youse want more?\"\n\n\"I'm writing, quiet.  Faulkner, Henson and Dobbs, right?\"\n\n\"That's whad'I said, yeah.\"\n\n\"So how come you know so much?\"\n\n\"That's my job. I deal in information.  Pretty good, huh?\"\n\n\"Maybe. I gotta check it out.  That last stuff was . . .\"\n\n\"Hey!\"  Vito interrupted, \"I told youse 'bout that.  Eh,  paysan,\nwhat's a slip up among friends, right?\"\n\n\"I'll ignore that.  Gimme a couple of days, I'll call you.\"\n\n\"Like  hell  you will. I'll call you.  You'll see, this  is  good\nstuff.  No shit.  All right? Two days.\"\n\nClick.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Monday,  December 14\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nThe  FBI runs a little known counter intelligence operation  from\nthe  middle of a run down Washington, D.C. neighborhood  on  Half\nStreet.   Getting  in and out is an exercise in  evasive  not  to\nmention  defensive driving.  The South East quadrant of  Washing-\nton,  D.C. is vying for the drug capital of the nation, and  per-\nhaps  has  the dubious distinction of having the  highest  murder\nrate  per capita in the United States. Since the CI  division  of\nthe  FBI  is a well kept secret, its location  was  strategically\nchosen  to keep the casual passerby from stopping in for a  chat.\nBesides,  there was no identification on the front of the  build-\ning.\n\nMost  Americans think that the CIA takes care of  foreign  spies,\nbut their agents are limited to functioning on foreign land.   On\nthe domestic front the FBI Counter Intelligence Group is assigned\nto  locate and monitor alien intelligence activities.  For  exam-\nple,  CI-3 is assigned to focus on Soviet and East  Bloc  activi-\nties, and other groups focus on their specific target  countries.\nThus,  there  is a certain amount of competition, not all  of  it\nhealthy,  between the two agencies chartered to protect  our  na-\ntional  interests.  The CIA is under the impression that it  con-\ntrols all foreign investigations, even if they tread upon  United\nStates  territory.   This line of thinking has  been  a  constant\nsource  of irritation and inefficiency since the OSS  became  the\nCIA  during  the Truman administration.  Only during  the  Hoover\nreign  at the FBI days was there any sense  of peaceful  coexist-\nence.  Hoover did what he damn well pleased, and if anyone  stood\nin  his  way,  he simply called up the White House  and  had  the\nroadblock removed.  Kennedy era notwithstanding, Hoover held  his\nown for a 50 year reign.\n\nTyrone  Duncan  received  an additional  lesson  on  inter-agency\nrivalry when he was called down to Half Street.  His orders  were\nsimilar to those he had received from  the safe house in  George-\ntown  months before.  Stick to your hackers and viruses,  period,\nhe was told. If it smells of foreign influence, let the CI  fight\nit out with Langley.  Keep your butt clean.\n\nIn 25 years of service, Tyrone had never been so severely  admon-\nished for investigating a case that he perceived as being  domes-\ntic in nature.  The thought of foreign influences at work had not\noccurred to him, until CI brought it up.\n\nAs  far as he was concerned the quick trip from New York to  Half\nStreet  was  a bureaucratic waste of time  and  money.   However,\nduring the fifteen minute discussion he was told by his CI compa-\ntriots that both the blackmail and the ECCO investigations situa-\ntions had international repercussions and he should keep his nose\nout  of  it.  CI was doing just fine without  Tyrone's  help.\u000fThe\nmeeting, or warning as Tyrone Duncan took it, served to raise  an\ninternal flag.\n\nThere  was a bigger picture, something beyond a classical  black-\nmail operation and some hackers screwing with government  comput-\ners,  and he was being excluded.  That only meant one thing.   He\nwas  pushing  someone's button and he didn't know how,  where  or\nwhy.   The  Trump Shuttle flight back to La Guardia  gave  Tyrone\ntime  to  think  about it, and that only  incensed  him  further.\nAren't  we all on the same team?  If I stumbled  onto  something,\nand you want me to back off, O.K., but at least let me know  what\nI'm missing.\n\nTwenty  five  years and a return to Hoover paranoia.   He  under-\nstood,  and  advocated,  the need for secrecy,  privacy  and  the\ntrappings  of  confidentiality.   But,  compartmentalization   of\ninformation this extreme was beyond the normal course to which he\nwas accustomed.  The whole thing stunk.\n\nHe  arrived back at New York's Federal Square during lunch  hour.\nNormally there was a minimal staff at that hour, or hour and half\nor  two hours depending upon your rank.  When the elevator  doors\nopened on Level 5, seventy feet under lower Manhattan, he  walked\ninto  a  bustle of activity normally present only  when  visiting\nheads  of state need extraordinary security.  He was  immediately\naccosted  by  eager  subordinates.  The  onslaught  of  questions\noverwhelmed  him, so he ignored them and walked through the  maze\ndirectly to his office.\n\nHis  head ringing, he plopped himself down behind his  desk.   He\nstared  at the two agents who followed him all the way, plus  his\nsecretary  stood  in  the open  door,  watching  with  amusement.\nDuncan was not appreciative of panic situations.  His silence was\ncontagious.\n\n\"Who's first?\"  He asked quietly.\n\nThe  two agents looked at each other and one spoke. \"Uh,  sir,  I\nthink we have a lead in the blackmail operation.\"  Duncan  looked\nat the other, offering him a chance to speak.\n\n\"Yessir,  it  seems  to have broken all over  at  once.\"   Duncan\nopened his eyes wide in anticipation.  Well, he, thought, go on.\n\nThe first agent picked up the ball.  \"Demands.  The  blackmailers\nare making demands.  So far we have six individuals who said they\nwere  recontacted by the same person who had first called them  a\nyear ago.\"\n\nDuncan sat upright.  \"I want a complete report, here, in 1  hour.\nWe'll talk then.  Thank you gentlemen.\"   They took their cue  to\nexit  and  brushed by, Tyrone's secretary  on their way  out  the\ndoor.\n\n\"Yes, Gloria?\"  Duncan treated her kindly, not with the  adminis-\ntrative brusqueness he often found necessary to motivate some  of\nhis agents.\n\n\"Good  morning, or afternoon, sir.  Pleasant trip?\"  She knew  he\nhated sudden trips to D.C.  It was her way of teasing her boss.\n\n\"Wonderful!\" Tyrone beamed with artificial enthusiasm.  \"Book  me\non  the  same flights every day for a month.   Definite  E-ticket\nride.\"\n\n\"Do  you remember a Franklin Dobbs?  He was here some  time  ago,\nabout, I believe the same matter you were just discussing?\"   Her\ndemureness pampered Duncan.\n\n\"Dobbs? Yes, why?\"\n\n\"He's  been  waiting all morning.  Had to see you,  no  on  else.\nShall I show him in?\"\n\n\"Yes, by all means, thank you.\"\n\n\"Mr.  Dobbs, how good to see you again.  Please,\" Duncan  pointed\nat  a  chair in front of his desk.  \"Sit down.  How  may  I  help\nyou?\"\n\nDobbs  shuffled over to the chair and practically fell into   it.\nHe sighed heavily and looked down at his feet.  \"I guess it's all\nover.  All over.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?  My secretary, said you were being blackmailed\nagain.   I  think you should know I'm not working  on  that  case\nanymore.\"\n\n\"This  time it's different,\" Dobbs said, his eyes darting  about.\n\"They want money, a lot of money, more than we have.  Last time I\nreceived a call I was told some very private and specific  knowl-\nedge  about  our company that  we preferred  to  remain  private.\nThat  information contained all our pricing,  quotation  methods,\nprofit  figures, overhead . . .everything our  competitors  could\nuse.\"\n\n\"So  you  think  your competition is  blackmailing  you,\"  Duncan\noffered.\n\n\"I  don't know.  If they wanted the information, why call me  and\ntell me?  We haven't been able to figure it out.\"\n\n\"What  about  the others,\" Duncan thought out loud.  \"The  others\nwith access to the information?\"\n\n\"Everyone  is suspecting everyone else.  It's not healthy.   Now,\nafter this, I'm thinking of packing  it in.\"\n\n\"Why now? What's different?\"\n\n\"The demands.  I can't believe it's my competitors.  Sure, it's a\ncut throat business, but, no, it's hard to believe.\"\n\n\"Stranger  things have happened, Mr. Dobbs.\"  Duncan tried to  be\nsoothing.  \"The demands, what were they?\"\n\n\"They  want  three million dollars, cash.  If we don't  pay  they\nsaid  they'd give away our company secrets  to  our  competitors.\nWe don't have the cash.\"\n\nDuncan felt for the man.  Dobbs had been right.  There was  noth-\ning the FBI could have done to help.  No demands, no  recontacts,\nand no leads, just a lot of suspicion.  But, now, the Bureau  was\nin a position to help.\n\n\"Mr. Dobbs, rest assured, we will pursue this case  aggressively.\nWe  will  assign you two of our top agents, and,  in  cases  like\nthis,  we are quite successful.\"  Duncan's upbeat tone was  meant\nto lift Dobbs' spirits.  \"Was there anything else demanded?\"\n\n\"No, nothing, they just told me not to go to the police.\"\n\n\"You haven't told anyone, have you?\"  Duncan asked.\n\n\"No, not even my wife.\"\n\n\"Mr.  Dobbs,  let me ask you a couple more things,  then  I  will\nintroduce  you to some fine men who will help you.  Do  you  know\nanyone else who is in your position?  Other people who are  being\nblackmailed in similar ways?\"\n\nDobbs  shuffled his feet under the chair, and picked at the  edge\nof the chair.  Duncan hit a raw nerve.\n\n\"Mr.  Dobbs,  I don't want names, no specifics.  It's  a  general\nquestion.  Do you know others?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Dobbs said almost silently.\n\n\"Do  you  know how many?\"  Duncan needed details if  his  current\nline of thinking would pan out into a viable theory.\n\n\"No, not exactly.\"\n\n\"Is it five?  Ten?  More than Ten? Twenty-five? More than twenty-\nfive?\"  Dobbs nodded suddenly.\n\n\"Do  you mean that you know of 25 other companies that are  going\nthrough  what  you're going through?  Twenty five?\"   Tyrone  was\nincredulous at the prospects.  The manpower alone to  investigate\nthat many cases would totally overwhelm his staff.  There was  no\nway.  The ramifications staggered him.  Twenty five, all at once.\n\n\"Yeah. At least.\"\n\n\"I  know you can't tell me who they are . . .\" Duncan hoped  that\nDobbs might offer a few.\n\n\"No.  But,  look  at their stocks. They're not  doing  well.  Our\ncompetitors seem to be getting the best of the deal.\"\n\nTwenty  five cases in New York alone, and he knows of at least  6\nothers, so far.  The rekindled blackmail operation, after  months\nof  dead  ends.  Duncan wondered how big the monster  behind  the\nhead  could  get.  And how could the FBI handle  it  all.    Poor\nbastard.  Poor us.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Tuesday, December 15\n     New York\n\nIt was before 8:00 A.M. and Scott cursed himself for arriving  at\nhis office at this ungodly hour.  He had found the last piece  of\nthe  puzzle, didn't sleep very much, and was in high gear  before\n6:00.   Scott couldn't remember the last time he had  been  awake\nthis early, unless it was coming round the long way.  He scurried\npast security, shaking his ID card as he flew through the closing\ndoors on the express elevator. The office hadn't yet come to life\nso Doug McGuire was available without a wait or interruption.\n\n\"I need some expense money,\" Scott blurted out at Doug.\n\n\"Yeah,  so?\"   Doug  sounded exasperated  with  Scott's  constant\nrequests  for money.  He didn't even look up from his  impossibly\ndisorganized desk.\n\n\"I'm serious . . .,\" Scott came back.\n\n\"So am I.\"  Doug firmly laid down his pen on his desk and  looked\nat  Scott.   \"What the hell kind of expenses do  you  need  now?\"\nScott  spent more money than several reporters combined,  and  he\nnever  felt  bad about it.  While a great deal of  his  work  was\nperformed at the office or at home, his phone bills were extraor-\ndinary as were his expenses.\n\nScott  had developed a reputation as willing to go to almost  any\nlengths to get a story. Like the time he hired and the paper paid\nfor  a call girl to entertain Congressman Daley  from  Wisconsin.\nShe  was  supposed to confirm, in any way necessary,  that  LeMal\nChemical was buying votes to help bypass certain approval  cycles\nfor their new line of drugs.  She accidentally confirmed that  he\nwas  a homosexual, but not before he slipped and the lady of  the\nevening became the much needed confirmation.\n\nAs Scott put it, Daley's embarrassed resignation was  unavoidable\ncollateral  damage in stopping the approval of a drug  as  poten-\ntially dangerous as thalidomide.\n\nOr  then there was the time that Scott received an anonymous  tip\nthat the Oil Companies had suppressed critical  temperature-emis-\nsion  ratio calculations, and therefore the extent of the  green-\nhouse effect was being sorely underestimated.  As a result of his\nresearch and detective work, and the ability to verify and under-\nstand the physics involved, Scott's articles forced a re-examina-\ntion  of the dangers.  He received a New York Writer's Award  for\nthat series.\n\nWhen  Doug had hired Scott, as a thirty-something  cub  reporter,\nthey  both  thought that Scott would fit in, nice and  neat,  and\nwrite  cute,  introspective technical pieces.   Neither  expected\nScott  to  quickly  evolve into a innovative  journalist  on  the\noffensive who had the embryo of a cult following.\n\nBut  Scott  Mason also performed a lot of the more  mundane  work\nthat  most  writer's  suffer with until the  better  stories  can\njustify  their full time efforts. New products, whiz  bang  elec-\ntronic  toys for the kitchen, whiz bangs for the  bathroom.   New\ncomputer this, new software that.\n\nNow,  though,  he was on the track, due in part he  admitted,  to\nDoug coercing him into writing the computer virus bits.  Yes,  he\nwas wrong and Doug was right.  The pieces were falling in  place.\nSo, no matter what happened, it was Doug's fault.\n\n\"I'm going to Europe.\"\n\n\"No you're not!\"  thundered Doug.\n\n\"Yes I am. I gotta go . . .\"  Scott tried to plead his case.\n\n\"You  aren't  going anywhere, and that's final.\"   Doug  retorted\nwithout a pause.  He stared challengingly through Scott.\n\n\"Doug,\" Scott visibly calmed himself, \"will you at least hear  me\nout,  before  telling me no?  At least listen to me, and  if  I'm\nwrong, tell me why.  O.K.?\"  Same routine, different day, thought\nScott.   The calmer, sincere request elicited empathy from  Doug.\nMaybe he'd been too harsh.\n\n\"Sorry,  it's  automatic to say 'no'.  You know  that  they,\"  he\npointed  down  with  his thumb, \"have us  counting  paper  clips.\nSure, explain to me why I'm going to say 'no',\"  he joked. Doug's\novertly stern yet fatherlike geniality returned.\n\n\"O.K.\"  Scott  mentally organized his thoughts.  He  touched  his\nfingers  to his forehead and turned to sit on the edge of  Doug's\ndesk.  A traditional no-no. \"Without my notes . . .\"\n\n\"Screw the notes, what have you got? If you don't know the  mate-\nrial, the notes won't help. They're the details, not the  story.\"\nScott had heard this before.\n\n\"Sure,  sorry.\" He gained confidence and went straight  from  the\nhip.   \"Fact one.  The FBI is investigating a  massive  blackmail\ncampaign  that  nobody wants us to talk about, and  probably  for\ngood  reason from what I can see. As of now, there is no clue  at\nall to whom is behind the operation.\n\n\"Fact two. My story got pulled by CIA, NSA or someone that pushed\nthe AG's buttons.  And this Tempest thing gets heads turning  too\nfast  for my taste.\"  Doug nodded briefly.  Scott made  sense  so\nfar, both things were true.\n\n\"Three,\"  Scott  continued, \"First State has been the  target  of\nhackers, plus, we have Sidneys . . .\"\n\n\"Sort of.  McMillan hasn't caved in on that yet.\"\n\n\"Agreed,  but  it's still good.  You and I both know  it.\"   Doug\ngrudgingly nodded in agreement.\n\n\"Then we have all those papers that came from a van, or more than\none van I would guess, and not a damned thing we can do with them\naccording to Higgins.\"  Again, Doug nodded, but he wondered where\nall  of this was going.  \"Then the EMP-T bombs, NASA,  the  Phone\nCompany,  and all of these viruses.  What we have is a number  of\napparently  dissimilar events that have one  common  denominator:\ncomputers.\"\n\nScott  waited  for a reaction from Doug that didn't  come  so  he\ncontinued.   \"Don't you see, the van with the computer data,  the\nendless  files,  the Sidneys problems, pulling  my  stories,  the\nhackers?  Even the viruses.  They're starting to get a little out\nof hand.  It's all the same thing!\"\n\nDoug  rolled his head from side to side on his shoulder.   Rather\nthan boredom, Scott knew that Doug was carefully thinking through\nthe logic of it.  \"Aren't you acting the engineer instead of  the\nreporter here?  Miss the old line of work 'eh?\"\n\n\"Give  me a break!  You and your viruses are the ones who got  me\ninto this mess in the first place.\"  Scott knew it would come up,\nso  he had been ready and grabbed the opportunity Doug  had  just\ngiven  him.   \"That's exactly the point!\"  Scott leaped  off  the\ndesk to his feet.  \"All we have are technical threads, pieces  of\na  puzzle.  It's a classic engineering problem.\"  Although  Scott\nhad  never been a brilliant engineer, he could argue  the  issues\nfluently.\n\n\"Let me give you an example.  When I was in defense  electronics,\nwhenever  someone  built something we had  to  document,  without\nfailure,  it didn't work.  Radar, navigation, communications,  it\ndidn't matter. The engineers forever were releasing products that\nfailed  on  the first pass.\"  Doug stopped rolling his  head  and\nlooked at Scott with a blank stare.\n\n\"We had these terrifically advanced products meant to defend  our\ncountry  and they didn't work.  So, we had to tell the  engineers\nwhat  was wrong so they could figure it out.  Our  own  engineers\nand  I got involved more times than we liked because the response\ntime  from  the contractors was for shit.  They didn't  care  any\nmore.   Since we hadn't designed it, we only saw the pieces  that\nwere  on  the fritz, we had symptoms and had to figure  out  what\nthey  meant in order to diagnose the failure so we could get  the\ndesigners  to  come  up with a fix.  The point is,  we  only  had\nshreds  of  evidence, little bits of technical  information  from\nwhich  to try to understand the complete system.  That's  exactly\nwhat's going on here.\"\n\n\"So?\" Doug said dead panned.\n\n\"So,\" Scott avoided getting incensed. \"You're damn lucky you have\nme  around.   I see a pattern, a trail, that leads I  don't  know\nwhere, but I have to follow the trail.  That's my job.\"\n\n\"What has Europe got to do with it?\"  Doug was softening.\n\n\"Oops, thanks! I almost forgot.\"  Scott felt stupid for a second,\nbut  he  was without notes, he rationalized. \"Kirk is  my  hacker\ncontact who I've been talking to over my computer. Gives me  real\ngood stuff.  He says there's a conference of hackers in Amsterdam\nnext week.  It's a real private affair, and he got me an  invite.\nI think, no I know, there's something bigger going down;  somehow\nall of these pieces tie together and I need to find out how.\"\n\n\"That's it?\"  Scott looked disappointed at Doug's reaction.\n\n\"No, that's not it!  You know that the Expos\u001b\u0002\n has been publishing\nbits and pieces of the same stuff we haven't been publishing?\"\n\nScott didn't know which of his arguments made the case, but  Doug\ncertainly reacted to the competitive threat.  \"How much?\"\n\n\"How much what?\"  Scott wasn't ready for the question.\n\n\"For Europe?  How much play money will you need.  You know I have\nto sell this upstairs and they  . . .\"\n\n\"Airfare  and a couple of nights plus food.  That's it.   If  you\nwant,\"   Scott  readied the trump card he had never used  at  the\nTimes.  \"I'll  pay for it myself, and submit it all when  I  come\nback.  Then, you make the call. I'll trust you.\"\n\n\"You really think it's that important?\"  Doug said.\n\n\"Absolutely.   No  question.  Something's going  on  that  smells\nrotten,  bad, and it includes the Government, but I have no  idea\nhow.\"   Scott spoke as if he was on a soapbox.  He had  shot  his\nwad.  That was it.  Anything more was a rehash of the same  stuff\nand  it  would have been worthless to say more.  He shut  up  and\nwaited  for Doug who enjoyed making his better reporters  anxious\nwith anticipation.\n\n\"Have  a good trip,\"  Doug said nonchalantly.  He leaned  forward\nto  hunch  over  his desk, and ignoring Scott, he  went  back  to\nredlining another writer's story.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Tuesday, December 15\n     Scarsdale, New York\n\nKirk  delivered  on his word.  In his E-Mail  repository  at  the\nTimes,  Scott found a message from Kirk.  It was short,  but  all\nScott needed to hear.  Never mind how Kirk broke into the comput-\ners.\n\n     Tues.  12/15  00:02:14.1\n     << FREEDOM BBS >>\n\nRepo Man,\n\nWhen  you  arrive, call 602-356.  It's an Amsterdam  number.  Jon\nGruptmann is your contact.  I told him you were a reporter, but a\ngood one. I said you're working to preserve freedom of electronic\ninformation  and you were sick and tired of the police and  media\nbeating up on hackers.  He thinks you want to give the other side\nof the story to the public.\n\nJon is one of the best in Holland and  anywhere.\nHe  agreed to meet and talk with you himself.  He will  show  you\naround. Have a good trip.  Call me, oops, no can do.\n\nOh, Yes.  Mona Lisa frowned. I will call you.\n\nKirk\n\n     << TRANSMITTED BY THE FREEDOM BBS SERVICE >>\n\nWhen Scott got home from work he checked his E-mail and found the\nsame  message from Kirk, telling him to be on the  line  tonight.\nThe  Mona  Lisa frowned.  That meant to Scott  that  someone  was\ninterested enough in Kirk's activities, or alleged activities  at\nFirst State to break in and ruin his computers.  And Da  Vinci's.\nWho was so scared of hackers, or of what they knew to go to these\nlengths?  How many have had their computers ravaged?\n\nAs anticipated, midnight brought Kirk calling.\n\nWE'RE GOING AFTER THEM\n\nAfter who?\n\nFREEDOM.   NEMO AND SOME PHREAKS PHRIENDS ARE GOING TO  FIND  OUT\nWHAT'S GOING ON.\n\nWhat's wrong?\n\nDID  YOU EVER TALK TO ANYONE AND FEEL THAT THINGS  WEREN'T  QUITE\nRIGHT?\n\nSure.\n\nWELL  SO DO I.  DA VINCI IS A STRAIGHT WHITE HAT HACKER.   I  HAD\nHIM  CHECKED OUT BY PHRIENDS.  THEN I CALLED FREEDOM  AND  JOINED\nUP.  I GAVE THEM A BUNCH OF SOFTWARE AND I TOOK SOME.  I ASKED TO\nCHAT WITH THE SYSOP AND WE'VE BEEN  TALKING DAILY.  STRANGE GUY.\n\nStrange? Over a computer?\n\nYOU CAN TELL.  HE SPOKE WITH AN ACCENT.\n\nYou're putting me on.\n\nREALLY.   EVER  READ A VCR MANUAL TRANSLATED FROM  THE  JAPANESE?\nTHEY LEAVE OUT THE the's FROM EVERYTHING.  IT HAS AN ACCENT.  AND\nTHE WORD DUDE ESPECIALLY UPSET HIM.\n\nDude?  Good reason to be suspicious.\n\nTHEN I HACKED HIS SYSTEM WHEN I KNEW HE WASN'T ON LINE.  JUST  TO\nLOOK AROUND MIND YOU.\n\nHow can you do that?\n\nBBS'S  ONLY  COME  IN SO MANY FLAVORS.  THEY'RE  PRETTY  EASY  TO\nCRACK, ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE A COPY TO WORK ON.\n\nAh hah!\n\nI FOUND HUGE AREAS OF HIS COMPUTER NOT ASSIGNED TO THE BBS.\n\nSo?\n\nA BBS COMPUTER IS DEDICATED TO ONE FUNCTION, BBS'ING.  SO I POKED\nAROUND  AND FOUND ANOTHER COMPLETE BBS SYSTEM, NOT PART OF  FREE-\nDOM.   TOO  MUCH WAS ENCRYPTED, THOUGH, TO LEARN  MUCH.   BUT  WE\nWILL.\n\nDon't get yourself into hot water again . . .\n\nNOT TO WORRY.  I'LL BECOME ONE OF THEM.  PLAY THEIR GAMES.   IT'S\nEASY TO BE ANYONE YOU WANT.  I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND\nTHE SCENES.  SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday, December 18\n     New York\n\n     U.S. Army on Virus Vigil!\n     by Scott Mason\n\nIn July of 1990, the United States Army joined the inner  sanctum\nof the Computer Hacker.\n\nThe Pentagon had finally realized that the computer is as  essen-\ntial  to battlefield operations and communications as is the  gun\nand the radio.\n\nTherefore,  as  the logic goes, why shouldn't  the  computers  be\ndirectly attacked as are other military targets.  In keeping with\nthat  line  of  thinking, the Army said,  use  computer  viruses.\nViruses are those little gremlins which roam throughout a comput-\ner  system,  hiding  themselves in silicon  gulches,  waiting  to\nambush mountains of megabytes and erase deserts of data.  Perfect\nfor modern warfare.\n\nThe Army issued an RFP, (Request For Proposal) asking the private\nsector to study and design computer viruses and other methods  to\nbe  used offensively against enemy computers.  The  half  million\ndollar contract was awarded to a Beltway Bandit, a small  govern-\nment  sub-contractor so named for their proximity  to  Interstate\n495, which loops around Washington, D.C.\n\nSo, the Army is going into the hacking business, but this  brings\nup quite a few questions.\n\nQuestion  I.   How long has the Government  known  that  computer\nviruses and other maladies could be used in a strategic militari-\nly offensive fashion?  RFP's are always preceded by much internal\nresearch  and consultation with private industry. The  Government\ntypically will have issued RFI's, (Requests For Information)  and\nRFQ's  (Request For Quotes) and already have a darn good idea  of\nwhat's available and from whom.\n\nQuestion II.  Has the Government already sponsored such research?\nThe existence of the EMP-T Bomb has created quite a furor.\n\nQuestion  III.   What if the Army created  experimental  computer\nviruses and they get loose?  Who is responsible for silicon based\nbiological warfare on desktop computers?\n\nQuestion  IV.   Have any computer viral outbreaks  actually  been\nGovernment projects  gone out of control?\n\nQuestion  V.  If the Government knew that civilian  and  military\ncomputers  could  be systematically attacked and  destroyed,  why\nhaven't  we done anything to defend ourselves against  a  similar\nassault?\n\nLast  month's attack on the Stock Exchange by secret EMP-T  bombs\nprompted  an investigation into such military  capabilities,  and\nsome surprising answers were uncovered.\n\nIn  an  attempt to get specific answers from  various  Government\nagencies, I located a secretive group called OCTAG/0N. (Offensive\nComputer Technology Applications Group/Zero-November).   OCTAG/0N\nis a highly classified interagency project whose sole function is\nto  develop  methods to destroy or disable computers  from  great\ndistances.\n\nAccording  to  a highly placed source at the  Pentagon,  OCTAG/0N\nallegedly  developed computer viruses that will destroy the  ene-\nmy's hard disks.  Successful deployment, to use Pentagon-ese,  is\nthe  hard part.  \"If we can get at their computers,\" an  engineer\nwith  OCTAG/0N said requesting anonymity, \"we can stop  them  in-\nstantly.   Getting them there has been the problem.  But  now  we\nknow how to get at their computers from great distances.\"\n\nIn the battlefield, for example, advanced tactical communications\ngroups  explode  small  Magnetic Bombs (EMP-T)  which  emit  very\nstrong  electromagnetic  pulses at certain frequencies.   The  EM\npulses  destroy  nearby  computers, (RAM,  ROM,  EPROM,  Magnetic\nstorage).   Some  computer  systems  are  'hardened'  with  extra\nshielding  as in the Tempest program.  Other computers,  such  as\nthose in Air Force One, inside missile silos, or in the  Pentagon\nWar  Room are additionally protected by the secret  C3I  programs\nwhich 'super-hardens' the computers against the intense  magnetic\npulses associated with above ground nuclear explosions.\n\nIntensely focussed energy beams of low power can totally  disrupt\nan unshielded computer as far away as three miles.   Synchronized\nInterference Techniques provide double duty to both listen in  on\nand jam air borne computer traffic.  One of OCTAG/0N's pet tricks\nis to broadcast a computer virus  from a small antenna so that it\nis caught by a computers communicating on the same frequency.  So\nsimple, yet so devious.\n\nIn conversations with computer experts and the underground hacker\ncommunity,  the  existence of such high tech  weaponry  has  been\nconfirmed, although the Department of Defense is still issuing  a\npredictable 'no comment'.\n\nSo, I have to ask again.  Why hasn't our Government been  helping\nus  protect ourselves against an apparently  formidable  computer\nweapons  complement?   I  hope \"The Other Guys\"  aren't  so  well\narmed.\n\nThis is Scott Mason, adding a chastity belt to my modem.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n               Chapter 17\n\n     Monday, December 28\n\n     A/K/A Software\n     by Scott Mason\n\nThe Christmas Virus is upon is.  So is the anticipated New  Years\nEve and New Year's Day Virus.\n\nSeems  like wherever I look, someone is making a virus to  attack\nmy computer or celebrate a holiday.\n\nRather than another rash of warnings about the impending doom and\ngloom  faced  by your computers, my editor asked me to  find  the\nlighter  side of computer viruses.  I strongly objected,  stating\nthat I found nothing amusing about them.  They were a deadly  and\ncowardly  form of terrorism that should be rewarded with  behead-\ning.\n\nHowever, there is one thing . . .\n\nThe  geniuses  who come up with the names for  viral  infections;\nabout as believable and laughable as a Batman comic.\n\nI wonder what most of us would think if our doctor told us we had\nthe Ping Pong virus instead of strep throat.   Or in spring  time\nwe contracted the April Fool's Virus.\n\nIt is entirely within the realm of reason that America's  comput-\ners go unprotected because of the sheer absurdity of the names we\nattach to each one.  Comical names create a comical situation, so\nno one takes the issue seriously.\n\nThe Marijuana virus conjures up images of a stoned orgy, and  why\nwould  a computer care about that.  The Fu Manchu virus  conjures\nup the Red Chinese Army crossing the Mississippi, which is clear-\nly not the case, so it is ignored.\n\nViruses  know  no national boundary.  The  Pakistani  virus,  the\nIcelandic,  the Israeli, Jerusalem A, Jerusalem B,  Jerusalem  C,\nLehigh,  Alameda,  Vienna,  Czech, Rumanian - I  found  over  900\ncurrent  and active viruses that are identified by their  reputed\nplace of origin.\n\nThe  Brain virus sounds more sinister than the Stoned Virus,  and\nFriday the 13th viruses are as popular as the movie sequels.  The\nColumbus  Day  Virus was actually dubbed by its authors  as  Data\nCrime, and might have generated more concern if not for the nick-\nnom-de-plume it inherited.\n\nSo  to fulfill my editor's dream, I will list a few of  the  more\ncreative  virus  names.   Some were chosen  by  the  programmers,\nothers  by the Virus Busters and others yet by the  media.    See\nwhat  you think each virus would do to your computer, or when  it\nwill strike, merely from the name.\n\n     The Vatican Virus               The Popeye Virus\n     The Garlic Virus            The Scrooge Virus\n     Teenage Mutant Ninja Virus          The Ides Virus\n     The Quaalude Virus              The Amphetamine Virus\n     Super Virus             The Tick Tock Virus\n     The String Virus            The Black Hole Virus\n     The Stupid Virus            Stealth\n\nI have a few of my own suggestions for future virus builders.\n\nThe Jewish Sex Virus (Dials your mother-in-law during a  romantic\ninterlude.)\n\nThe  Ronald  Reagan Virus (Puts your computer to  sleep  only  in\nimportant meetings.)\n\nThe Pee Wee Herman Virus (Garbage In Garbage Out)\n\nThe  Donald Trump Virus (Makes all of your spread sheets go  into\nthe red.)\n\nTomorrow, Viruses from Hell on Geraldo.\n\nNamely, this is Scott Mason.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Tuesday, December 29\n     Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Why the hell do I have to find out what's going on in the  world\nfrom  the  goddamned papers and CNN instead of  from  the  finest\nintelligence  services  in  the world?\"   The  President  snapped\nsarcastically  while sipping black coffee over his daily  collec-\ntion of U.S. and foreign papers.\n\nThe early morning ritual of coffee, newspapers and a briefing  by\nChief  of  Staff  Phil Musgrave provided the day  with  a  smooth\nstart.  Usually.\n\n\"I've been asking for weeks about this computer craziness.  All I\nget is don't worry, Mr. President,\" he said mimicking the classic\nexcuses he was sick and tired of hearing.  \"We have it taken care\nof,  Mr. President.  No concern of yours, Mr. President, we  have\neverything under control.  We temporarily have our thumbs up  our\nasses, Mr. President.\"  Phil stifled a giggle behind his napkin.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Phil,\" the President continued, \"but it irritates the\nshit  out of me.   The damn media knowing more about what's  hap-\npening  than we do.  Where the hell is that report I  asked  for?\nThe  one  on the bank hostage I've been requesting for  a  week?\"\nThe President's mood portended a rough day for the inner circle.\n\n\"Sir, as I understand, it wasn't ready for your desk yet.\"\n\n\"Do  the goddamned missiles have to land on the White House  lawn\nbefore we verify it's not one of our own?\"\n\nPhil  knew better than to attempt any dissuasion when the  Presi-\ndent got into these moods.  He took notes, and with luck it would\nblow over in a couple of days.  Today was not Phil's lucky day.\n\n\"I want a briefing.  Two Hours.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" the President said from behind his desk in the  oval\noffice,  \"I'd like to read you something I had Brian put  togeth-\ner.\"   The efficiency of the White House Press Office  under  the\nleadership  of Brian Packard was well known.  The  President  had\nthe  best  rapport  with the press that any President  had  in  a\ngeneration.\n\nHe  slipped on his aviator style glasses and pulled the  lobe  of\nhis  left  ear while reading from his desk.  \"Let's  start  here.\nPhone  Company Invaded by Hackers; Stock Exchange Halted by  Gov-\nernment  Bomb; Computer Crime Costs Nation $12 Billion  Annually;\nViruses  Stop Network;   Banks Lose Millions to  Computer  Embez-\nzlers;  Trojan Horse Defeats Government Computers; NASA  Spending\nMillions  On Free Calls for Hackers.\"  He looked for  a  reaction\nfrom  his  four key associates: Phil,  Quinton  Chambers,  Martin\nRoyce and Henry Kennedy.  \"If you don't know, these are headlines\nfrom newspapers and magazines across the country.\"\n\nThe  President  read  further from his  notes.   \"Viruses  Infect\nTrans-Insurance  Payments; Secret Service Computers Invaded;  NSA\nand  NIST  in  Security Rift; FBI Wasting  Millions  on  Computer\nBlackmail  Scheme; First National Bank Held Hostage;  Sperm  Bank\nComputer  Records  Erased; IRS Returns of the Super  Rich.\"   The\nPresident removed his glasses wanting answers.\n\n\"What is going on here, gentlemen?\" the President asked directly.\n\"I  am baffled that everyone else but me seems to know there's  a\nproblem, and that pisses me off.  Answers?\"\n\nHe wondered who would be the first to speak up.  Surprisingly, it\nwas  Henry,  who normally waited to speak last.   \"Sir,  we  have\nactive programs in place to protect classified computer systems.\"\n\n\"Then  what  are these about?\"  He waved a couple  of  sheets  of\npaper in the air.\n\n\"Of course we haven't fully implemented security everywhere  yet,\nbut  it  is an ongoing concern.  According to NSA,  the  rash  of\nrecent  computer  events are a combination of anomalies  and  the\npress blowing it all out of proportion.\"\n\n\"Do  you  believe Henry,\" the President asked, \"that  if  there's\nsmoke, a reasonable man will assume that there is a fire nearby?\"\nHenry nodded obligingly.  \"And what would you think if there were\na hundred plumes of smoke rising?\"\n\nHenry  felt stumped.  \"Jacobs assured me that he  had  everything\nunder control and . . .\"\n\n\"As I recall Henry,\" the President interrupted, \"you told me that\na couple of months ago when the papers found out about the  EMP-T\nbombs.  Do you recall, Henry?\"\n\n\"Yessir,\" he answered meekly.\n\n\"Then what happened?\"\n\n\"We have to rely on available information, and as far as we know,\nas far as we're being told, these are very minor events that have\nbeen sensationalized by the media.\"\n\n\"It says here,\" the President again donned his glasses,  \"Defense\nContractors  Live  with  Hackers; Stealth  Program  Uncovered  in\nDefense Department Computers; Social Security Computers At  Risk.\nAre  those  minor events?\"  He pointed the question at  not  only\nHenry.\n\n\"There was no significant loss of information,\" Coletree  rapidly\nsaid.   \"We  sewed up the holes before we were  severely  compro-\nmised.\"\n\n\"Wonderful,\"  the President said sarcastically.  \"And  what  ever\nhappened to that bank in Atlanta?  Hiring Those kids?\"\n\n\"If I may, sir?\"  Phil Musgrave filled the silence.  \"That was  a\nprivate concern, and we had no place to interfere - as is true in\nmost of these cases.  We can only react if government property is\naffected.\"\n\n\"What is being done about it?  Now I mean.\"\n\n\"We  have  activated CERT and ECCO,  independent  computer  crime\nunits to study the problem further.\"  As usual, Phil was impecca-\nbly  informed.  \"Last years the Secret Service and  FBI  arrested\nover 70 people accused of computer crimes.  The state of Pennsyl-\nvania  over 500, California 300.  Remember, sir, computer  crimes\nare generally the states' problems.\"\n\n\"I'm  wondering if it shouldn't be our problem, too,\" the  Presi-\ndent pondered.\n\n\"There  are  steps  in that direction, as well.   Next  week  the\nSenate hearings on Privacy and Technology Containment begin,  and\nas I understand it, they will be focusing on exactly this issue.\"\n\n\"Who's running the show?\"  the President asked with interest.\n\n\"Ah,\" Phil said ripping through his notes, \"Rickfield, sir.\"\n\n\"That bigot?  Christ.  I guess it could be worse.  We could  have\nended up with Homer Simpson.\"    The easing of tension worked  to\nthe President's advantage, for a brief moment.  \"I want the whole\npicture,  the good and the bad, laid out for me.\" He scanned  his\nprivate  appointment book.  \"Two weeks.  Is that long  enough  to\nfind out why I'm always the last to know?\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Wednesday, December 30\n     New York\n\n\"Scott Mason,\" Scott said answering the phone with his mouth full\nof hot pastrami on rye with pickles and mayonnaise.\n\n\"Scott?   It's Tyrone.\"  Tyrone's voice was quiet, just  about  a\nwhisper.\n\n\"Oh,  hi.\"   Scott continued to chew.  Scott  was  unsuccessfully\ntrying not to sound angry.\n\nOther than following Scott's articles in the paper, they had  had\nno  contact  since that eventful phone call a month  ago.   Since\nthen, Scott had made sure that they rode on different cars during\ntheir  daily commute into the city.  It was painful for  both  of\nthem  since  they had been close friends, but Scott  was  morally\nobligated,  so  he thought, to cut off  their  association  after\nTyrone  broke  the cardinal rule of all  journalists;  keep  your\nsources protected.  And, Tyrone had broken that maxim. Scott  had\nnot  yet learned that the Bureau made their own rules,  and  that\nthe  gentleman's agreement of off-the-record didn't carry  weight\nin their venue.\n\n\"How  have you been?\"  Tyrone said cordially.  \"Good bit of  work\nyou been doing.\"\n\n\"Yeah, thanks, thanks,\"  Scott  said stiffly.\n\nTyrone  had  already determined that he needed Scott if  his  own\nagency wouldn't help him.  At least Scott wasn't bound by idiotic\ngovernmental  regulations  that stifled rather  than  helped  the\ncause.  Maybe there was hope for cooperation yet, if  his  little\nfaux pas could be forgiven.\n\n\"We need to talk.  I've been meaning to call you.\"  Though Tyrone\nmeant it, Scott thought it was a pile of warmed up FBI shit.\n\n\"Sure,  let's  talk.\"   Scott's  apparent  indifference  bothered\nTyrone.\n\n\"Scott,  I  mean it,\" he said sincerely.  \"I have an  apology  to\nmake, and I want to do it in person.  Also, I think that we  both\nneed  each  other . . .you'll understand when I tell  you  what's\nbeen  going on.\"  Tyrone's deep baritone voice  conveyed  honesty\nand a little bit of urgency.  If nothing else, he had never known\nor  had any reason to suspect Tyrone of purposely  misleading  or\nlying  to him.  And their friendship had been a good one.   Plus,\nthe tease of a secret further enticed Scott into agreeing.\n\n\"Yeah,  what the hell.  It's Christmas.\"  Scott's aloofness  came\nacross as phony, but Tyrone understood the awkwardness and let it\npass.\n\n\"How 'bout we meet at The Oyster Bar, Grand Central, and get shit\nfaced.  Merry Christmas from the Bureau.\"\n\nThe  Oyster Bar  resides on the second lower level of Grand  Cen-\ntral  Station, located eighty feet beneath Park Avenue and  42nd.\nStreet. It had become a fairly chic restaurant bar in the  '80's;\nthe seafood was fresh, and occasionally excellent. The  patronage\nof the bar ranged from the commuter who desperately quaffed  down\ntwo  or three martinis to those who enjoyed the  seafaring  ambi-\nence.   The  weathered hardwood walls were  decorated  with  huge\nstuffed crabs, swordfish, lifesavers and a pot pourri of  fishing\naccouterments.   The  ceilings were bathed in worn  fishing  nets\nthat occasionally dragged too low for anyone taller than 6 feet.\n\nAway  from the bar patrons could dine or drink in  privacy,  with\ndim  ten  watt lamps on each table to cut through  the  darkness.\nTyrone  was  sitting at such a table, drink in  hand  when  Scott\ncraned  his  neck from the door to find his  friend  through  the\ncrowd.  He ambled over, and Tyrone stood to greet him.  Scott was\ncool, but willing to give it a try.  As usual Tyrone was elegant-\nly  attired,  in a custom tailored dark gray pin stripe  suit,  a\nfitted designer shirt and a stylish silk tie of the proper width.\n\nScott  was  dressed just fine as far as he  was  concerned.   His\nsneakers were clean, his jeans didn't have holes and the  sweater\nwould  have gained him admission to the most private ski  parties\nin  Vermont. Maybe they were too different and  their  friendship\nhad been an unexplainable social aberration; an accident.\n\nScott's stomach tightened.  His body memory recalled the time the\nprincipal had suspended him from high school for spreading liquid\nbanana  peel on the hall floors and then ringing the  fire  drill\nalarm.   The picture of 3000 kids and 200 teachers  slipping  and\nsliding and crawling out of the school still made Scott smile.\n\n\"What'll  you  have?\" Tyrone gestured at a  waiter  while  asking\nScott for his preference.\n\n\"Corona, please.\"\n\nTyrone  took  charge. \"Waiter, another double and a  Corona.\"  He\nwaved  the  waiter  away. \"That's better.\"   Tyrone  was  already\nslightly  inebriated.  \"I guess you think I'm a real  shit  hole,\nhuh?\"\n\n\"Sort  of,\"  Scott agreed. \"I guess you could put it  that  way.\"\nScott was impressed with Ty's forthright manner.  \"I can think of\na bunch more words that fit the bill.\"  At least Tyrone  admitted\nit.  That was a step in the right direction.\n\nTy  laughed.  \"Yeah, I bet you could, and you  might  be  right.\"\nScott's  drink came.  He took a thirsty gulp from the  long  neck\nbottle.\"\n\n\"Ease  on  down the road!\"  Ty held his half empty drink  in  the\nair.   It was peace offering.  Scott slowly lifted his and  their\ndrinks  met  briefly.   They both sipped again,  and  an  awkward\nsilence followed.\n\n\"Well,  I guess it's up to me to explain, isn't it?\" Tyrone  ven-\ntured.\n\n\"You  don't have to explain anything. I understand,\"  Scott  said\ncaustically.\n\n\"I  don't think you do, my friend.  May I at least have  my  last\nwords before you shoot?\"  Tyrone's joviality was not as effective\nwhen nervous.\n\nScott  remembered that he used the same argument with  Doug  only\ndays before.  He eased up. \"Sure, ready and aimed, though.\"\n\n\"I'm  quitting.\"  Tyrone's face showed  disappointment,  resigna-\ntion.\n\nThe  beer bottle at Scott's lips was abruptly laid on the  table.\n\"Quitting?   The  FBI?\"  Tyrone nodded.  \"Why?   What  happened?\"\nFor one moment Scott completely forgot how angry he was.\n\nThe  din of the Oyster Bar made for excellent cover.  They  could\nspeak freely with minimal worry of being overheard.\n\n\"It's  a long story, but it began when they pulled your  article.\nGod,  I'm sorry, man,\" Tyrone said with empathy.  The furrows  on\nhis  forehead deepened as he searched for a reaction from  Scott.\nNothing.\n\nTy  finished  off his drink and started on the  refill.   \"Unlike\nwhat you probably believe, or want to believe, when you called me\nthat morning, I had no idea what you were talking about.  It  was\nseveral  hours before I realized what had happened. If I had  any\nidea . . .\"\n\nScott  stared  blankly  at Tyrone. You haven't  convinced  me  of\nanything, Scott thought.\n\n\"As  far as I knew, you were writing an article that had no  par-\nticular consequence . . .\"\n\n\"Thanks a shitload,\" Scott quipped.\n\n\"No,  I  mean, I had  no idea of the national  security  implica-\ntions, and besides, it was going to be in the paper the next  day\nanyway.\"  Tyrone  shrugged with his hands in the  air  for  added\nemphasis.  \"Tempest meant nothing to me. All I said was that  you\nand I had been talking.  I promise you, that's it.  As a  friend,\nthat  was  the extent of it.  They took it from  there.\"   Tyrone\nextended  his hands in an open gesture of conciliation.   \"All  I\nknew  was that what you'd said about CMR shook some people up  in\nD.C..   ECCO  has been quite educational.  Now I  know  why,  and\nthat's why I have to leave.\"\n\nThe  genuineness from Tyrone softened Scott's attitude some.   \"I\nthought you spooks stuck together.  Spy and die together.\"\n\nTyrone  contorted  his face to show disgust  with  that  thought.\n\"That'll  be the day. In fact it's the opposite.  A third of  our\nbudgets  are meant to keep other agencies in the dark about  what\nwe're doing.\"\n\n\"You're kidding!\"\n\n\"I wish I was.\"  Tyrone looked disheartened, betrayed.\n\n\"At any rate,\" Tyrone continued, \"I got spooked by the stunt with\nyour  paper and the Attorney General.  I just couldn't call  you,\nyou'll  see why.  The Agency is supposed to enforce the law,  not\nmake  it and they have absolutely no business screwing  with  the\npress. Uh-uh.\"  Tyrone took a healthy sip of his drink.  \"Reminds\nme of times that are supposed to be gone. Dead in the past.   Did\nyou know that I am a constitutional lawyer?\"\n\nScott ordered another beer and shook his head, no. Just a regular\nlawyer.  Will wonders never cease?\n\n\"Back  in  the  early 60's the South was not  a  good  place  for\nblacks.   Or Negroes as we were called back then.\"   Tyrone  said\nthe  word Negro with disdain.  He pulled his tie from  the  stiff\ncollar and opened a button.  \"I went on some marches in  Alabama,\nGod, that was a hot summer. A couple of civil rights workers were\nkilled.\"\n\nScott  remembered.  More from the movie Mississippi Burning  than\nfrom memory.\n\nCivil rights wasn't a black-white issue, Tyrone insisted. It  was\nabout  man's  peaceful  co-existence with  government.   A  legal\nissue.  \"I  thought that was an important  distinction  and  most\npeople were missing the point.  I thought I could make a  differ-\nence working from inside the system.  I was wrong, and I've  been\nblinded by it until now . . .you know.\n\n\"When I was in college the politicians screamed integration while\nthe  poor  blacks no more wanted to be bussed to the  rich  white\nneighborhood that the rich whites wanted the poor blacks in their\nschools.\"  Tyrone spoke from his heart, his soul, with a touch of\nresentment  that Scott had not seen before.  But then,  they  had\nnever  spoken of it before. This was one story that he  had  suc-\ncessfully  neglected  to share. \"Forced integration  was  govern-\nment's answer to a problem it has never understood.\n\n\"It's about dignity.  Dignity and respect, not government  inter-\nvention.   It's about a man's right to privacy and the  right  to\nlead his life the way he sees fit.  Civil rights is about how  to\nkeep  government from interfering with its citizens.   Regardless\nof color.\"  Tyrone was adamant.\n\n\"And  that's why you're gonna  quit?\"  Scott didn't see the  con-\nnection.\n\n\"No, goddamnit, no,\" Tyrone shouted.  \"Don't you get it?\"   Scott\nshook  his head.  \"They want to take them away.\"  He  spoke  with\nfinality and assumed Scott knew what he meant.  The liquor fogged\nhis brain to mouth speech connection.\n\n\"Who's  gonna take what away?\"  Scott asked, frustrated  by  Ty's\nramblings.\n\n\"I  know it's hokey, but the Founding Fathers had a plan, and  so\nfar it's survived two hundred years of scrutiny and division.   I\nwould  like  to think it can survive the computer  age.\"   Tyrone\nquieted  down some.  \"My father used to tell me, from the time  I\nwas  old enough to understand, that law was merely a  measure  of\nhow  much freedom a man was willing to sacrifice to  maintain  an\norderly society.\"\n\n\"My  father was a radical liberal among liberals,\" Tyrone  remem-\nbered.  \"Even today he'll pick a fight at the family barbecue for\nhis own entertainment.  And he'll hold his own.\"\n\nScott  enjoyed the image of a crotchety octogenarian stirring  up\nthe shit while his children isolated their kids from their  grand\nfather's intellectual lunacy.  What was this about?\n\nTyrone  caught  himself and realized that he wasn't  getting  his\npoint  across.  He took a deep  breath and slouched back  in  the\nchair that barely held him.\n\n\"From the beginning,\" he said.  \"I told you about ECCO, and  what\na  disaster it is.  No authority, no control, no  responsibility.\nAnd the chaos is unbelievable.\n\n\"I don't pretend to understand all of the computer jargon, but  I\ndo recognize when the NSA wants to control everything.  There's a\nphenomenal  amount  of  arrogance there.  The NSA  reps  in  ECCO\nbelieve  that  they  are the only ones who  know  anything  about\ncomputers  and  how to protect them.  I feel sorry for  the  guys\nfrom NIST.  They're totally underfunded, so they end up with both\nthe grunt work and the brunt of the jokes from the NSA.\n\n\"NSA  won't cooperate on anything.  If NIST says it's white,  NSA\nsays  it's black.  If NIST says there's room to  compromise,  NSA\ngets  more stubborn. And the academic types.  At long last I  now\nknow  what happened to the hippies:  they're all government  con-\nsultants  through   universities.   And all they want  to  do  is\nstudy,  study, study.  But they never come up with answers,  just\nmore questions to study.\n\n\"The  vendors try to sell their products and don't  contribute  a\ndamn  thing,\"  sighed  Tyrone.  \"A bunch of  industry  guys  from\ncomputer  companies  and the banks, and they're as baffled  as  I\nam.\"\n\n\"So why quit?  Can't you make a difference?\"\n\n\"Listen.  The FBI views computer crimes as inter-state in  nature\nand therefore under their domain.\"\n\nScott nodded in understanding.\n\n\"We  are  enforcement, only,\" Tyrone asserted.  \"We do  not,  nor\nshould  we make the laws.  Separation of power; Civics  101.   To\naccomplish anything, I have to be a private citizen.\"\n\n\"What do you want to accomplish?\"  asked Scott with great  inter-\nest.\n\n\"I want to stop the NSA.\"  Tyrone spoke bluntly and Scott sat too\nstunned to speak for long seconds.\n\n\"From what?\"  A sudden pit formed in Scott's stomach.\n\n\"I found out why they dumped on you about the CMR,\" Tyrone  said.\n\"I  haven't been able to tell you before, but it  doesn't  matter\nany  more.\"  Tyrone quickly shook off the veiling sadness.   \"NSA\nhas  a built-in contradiction.  On one hand they listen into  the\nworld  and spy for America.  This is supposed to be very  secret,\nespecially how they do it.  It turns out that CMR is one of their\n'secret' methods for spying on friends and foes alike.\n\n\"So, to keep our friends and foes from spying on us, they  create\nthe  secret Tempest program.  Except, they think it needs  to  be\nkept  a military secret, and the public sector be  damned.   They\nactually believe that opening the issue to the public will hamper\ntheir intelligence gathering capabilities because the enemy  will\nprotect against it, too.\"\n\nScott listened in fascination. What he was learning now more than\nmade up for the loss of one article.  He felt bad now that he had\noverreacted and taken it out on Tyrone.\n\n\"Same goes for the EMP-T bomb,\" Tyrone added.  \"Only they  didn't\nknow  that you were going to publish ahead of time like they  did\nwhen I opened up my fat trap.\"\n\nScott's eyes suddenly lit up. \"How much did you tell them?\"\n\n\"That I knew you and you were writing an article. That's it.\"\n\n\"Then how did they know what I had written?  It was pretty damned\nclose.  I assumed that you had . . .\"\n\n\"No way, man,\" Tyrone held his hands up.\n\n\"Then how did . . .Ty? What if they're using CMR on my computers?\nCould they . . .\"\n\nTyrone's  predicament was to decide whether or not to tell  Scott\nthat  he knew the NSA and others spied on Americans and  gathered\nintelligence  through  remote control means.  \"I  assume  they're\ncapable of anything.\"\n\n\"Shit!\"  Scott  exclaimed.  \"Privacy goes right out  the  window.\nDamn.\"   Scott rapidly spun in his chair and vacantly stared  off\nin space.  \"Is that legal?\"\n\n\"What?  CMR?  I looked into that briefly, and there's nothing  on\nthe  books  yet, but I did find out that tapping  cellular  phone\nconversations is legal.\"\n\n\"Phone tapping, legal?\"  Scott couldn't believe his ears.\n\n\"Cellular phones, yeah.  The FCC treats them like TV sets,  radi-\nos, satellites.  Anyone  can listen to any station.\"\n\n\"That's  incredible,\"  Scott said, mouth gaping.  \"I  wonder  how\nthey'll handle RF LAN's.\"\n\n\"RF LAN's,\" asked Ty.  \"What are those?\"\n\n\"A  bunch of computers tied together with radios.   They  replace\nthe  wires that connect computers now.  Can you imagine?\"   Scott\nsaw  the  irony in it.  \"Broadcasting your private  secrets  like\nthat?  Hah!  Or if you have your own RF network, all you have  to\ndo  is dial up another one and all the information ends up  right\nin  your  computer! Legal robbery.  Is this a  great  country  or\nwhat?\"\n\n\"Now  you know why I'm leaving.  The NSA cannot be  permitted  to\nkeep the public uninformed about vulnerabilities to their person-\nal  freedom.  And hiding under the umbrella of national  security\ngets old.  A handful of paranoid un-elected, un-budgeted, non-ac-\ncountable,  mid-level  bureaucrats  are deciding  the  future  of\nprivacy  and freedom in this country.  They are the ones who  are\nsaying, 'no, no problem,' when they know damn well it is a  prob-\nlem.  What they say privately is in diametric opposition to their\npublic statements and positions.\"\n\nScott stifled a nervous laugh.  Who wound Tyrone up?  A conspira-\ncy theory.  Tyrone was drunk.  \"Don't you think that maybe you're\ntaking  this a little far,\" he suggested. For the first  time  in\nyears the shoe was on the other foot.  Scott was tempering  some-\nbody elses extremes.\n\n\"Why the hell do you think there's so much confusion at ECCO  and\nCERT and the other computer SWAT teams?  NSA interferes at  every\nstep,\"  Tyrone responded.  \"And no, I am not taking this too far.\nI  haven't taken it far enough.  I sit with these guys  and  they\ntalk as though I'm not there.  I attend meetings where the  poli-\ncies and goals of ECCO are established.   Shit, I trust the dope-\nsmoking  hippies from Berkeley more than anyone from  the  Fort.\"\nThe  bitterness  came  through clearly, but Scott  could  see  it\nwasn't focussed on any one person or thing.\n\nBut  Scott  began to understand.  For over 20  years  Tyrone  had\ninsulated himself from the politics of the job and had seen  only\nwhat  he  wanted to see; a national Police  Force  enforcing  the\nlaws.  Tyrone loved the chase of the crime.  The bits and pieces,\nthe  endless  sifting of evidence, searching for clues  and  then\nbuilding a case from shreds.  The forensics of modern criminology\nhad  been so compelling for Tyrone Duncan that he had missed  the\nimpact  that the mass proliferation of technology would  have  on\nhis first love - The Constitution.\n\nThe sudden revelations and realizations of the last several weeks\nset his mind into high gear. Tyrone introspectively examined  his\nbeliefs;  he  tried  to review them from the  perspective  of  an\nidealistic  young man in his twenties.  What would he  have  done\nthen?  He realized the answer was easier found now that he was  a\nman of experience:  Do Something About It.\n\nFar  from a rebel looking for a cause, the cause jumped all  over\nTyrone with a vengeance and the tenacity of a barnacle.\n\nAll at once Scott knew that Tyrone was serious and that he  would\nbe a better friend if he congratulated instead of castigated.\n\n\"You know, I kind of understand a little.  Same thing with my ex-\nwife.\"\n\n\"Hey, that's not fair, man,\" Tyrone vigorously objected.  \"Maggie\nwas a dingbat . . .\"\n\n\"I know that and she knew that,\" Scott agreed, \"but that was what\nmade  her Maggie.\"  Tyrone nodded, remembering her antics.   \"And\nin  some ways we still love each other.  After ten years of  fun,\ngreat  fun, she wanted to get off of the planet more than I  did,\nso  she went to California.\"  The softness in Scott's voice  said\nhe still cared about Maggie, that she was a cherished part of his\nlife, that was and would remain in the past.\n\nScott shook off the melancholy and continued. \"It's the same  for\nyou.  You're married to the FBI, and while you still love it, you\nneed to let it go to move on with your life.\"\n\n\"Y'know, I don't know why everyone says you're so stupid,\" Tyrone\nsaid with respect.  \"UFO's aside, you can actually make sense.\"\n\n\"Maybe, maybe not. Doesn't really matter.  But I'm doing  exactly\nwhat  I  want to do.  And the day it stops being fun,  I'm  outta\nhere.\"\n\n\"Isn't that the arrogance of wealth speaking?\" Tyrone asked.\n\n\"And  you're any different?  The 22 room Tudor shack you live  in\nis  not exactly my vision of poverty.  As I see it, it's  one  of\nthe benefits,\" Scott said unembarrassed by his financial  securi-\nty.   \"Before  I made my money, I swore that when I got  rich,  I\nwould give something back.  You know, to the planet or society or\nsomething.    Do something useful and not for the  money.\"  Scott\nspoke  with  honest enthusiasm.  \"But I don't believe  there's  a\nrule  that  says I have to be miserable.  I love what I  do,  and\nwell,  I don't know.  The concept of career is different for  me.\nI  like  the  idea of doing a little bit of  everything  for  the\nexperience.  You know, I drove a cab for one night.  Glad I  did,\nbut never again.\"\n\n\"So?\" asked Tyrone.\n\n\"So, do what you want to do and enjoy it. Period.  As a friend of\na friend says, live long and prosper.\"\n\nScott  let  Tyrone  sit in contemplative silence  as  the  waiter\nbrought them two more.  They were doing a good job of sticking to\nthe plan of getting 'shiffaced'.\n\n\"You  know,\"  Tyrone opined,  \"INTERNET is only the  tip  of  the\niceberg. NASA is having ECCO and CERT look into over $12  Million\nin unaccounted-for telephone calls.   The Justice Department sold\nold  computers  containing  the names and other  details  of  the\nWitness  Protection  Program  to a junk dealer  in  Kentucky  and\nthey're suing him to get them back.  The Secret Service is  rede-\nsigning its protection techniques for the President since someone\ngot into their computers and copied the plans.  The computers  at\nMitre  have been used by hackers for years to get  at  classified\ninformation.    The  public hears less than 1%  of  the  computer\nproblems in the government.  And still, no one will do  anything.\nThere's  even talk that the missing Plutonium that  the  Israelis\ntheoretically stole in 1981 was actually a computer error.\"\n\n\"What do you want to do about it?\"  Scott was asking as a friend,\nnot a reporter.\n\n\"First,\" said a newly determined Tyrone,  \"I'm gonna nail me some\nof  these  mothers, and I'll do it with your help.   Then,  after\nthat?\"  Tyrone's old smile was suddenly back.  \"I think I'm gonna\nkick  myself some government ass.\"  Tyrone roared  with  laughter\nand  Scott joined the contagious behavior.  \"In the  meantime,  I\nwant  to  take  a look at some blackmail.  I  think  you  may  be\nright.\"\n\n\"About what?  I don't listen to what I tell you.\"\n\n\"Remember  you  said  that the  blackmail  scheme  wasn't  really\nblackmail.\"   Tyrone  shifted  his weight in  the  chair  and  he\nreached for the words through is fogged mind.  \"You said it might\nbe a way to make us too busy to see our own shadow.  That it  was\na cover up for another dissociated crime.\"\n\n\"Yeah? It might be,\" Scott said.\n\nTyrone's body heaved while he snickered. \"We finally have a lead.\nDemands have been made.\"\n\n\"What  kind? Who?  What do they want?\"  Scott's  journalist  mind\nclicked into gear.  \"What about the computer virus crap?\"\n\n\"I'm kind of looking into both, but this morning my interest  was\nrenewed.  A corporate type I met says not only he, but another 25\nor more of his corporate brethren are getting the same treatment.\nIf he's right, someone is demanding over $30 Million in ransoms.\"\n\n\"Jesus Christ! Is that confirmed?\"  Scott probed.\n\n\"Yes.  That's why I said you were right.\"\n\nThe  implications were tremendous, even to Scott's clouded  mind.\nWhile  the  legal  system might not be  convinced  that  computer\nradiation  was  responsible  for an  obviously  well  coordinated\ncriminal  venture,  he, as an engineer, realized  how  vulnerable\nanyone - everyone was.  The questions raced through his mind  all\nat once.\n\nOver  a  few dozen oysters and not as many drinks, Scott  and  Ty\nproceeded  to share their findings.  Scott had documents  up  the\nying-yang, documents he couldn't use in a journalistic sense, but\nmight  be valuable to the recent developments in Ty's  case.   He\nhad moved the files to his home; they were simply taking too much\nspace around his desk at the office.  They were an added  attrac-\ntion  to the disaster he called his study.  Scott agreed to  show\nTy  some  of them.  After the meeting with  Franklin  Dobbs,  and\nknowing there might be others in similar situations, Ty wanted an\ninformal look at Scott's cache.\n\n\"I've been holding back, Ty,\"  Scott said during a lull in  their\nconversation.\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"I  got  a call from a guy I had spoken to a few  months  ago;  I\nassume  he sent me those files, and he said that  key  executives\nthroughout the country were being blackmailed.  Some were borrow-\ning money from the mob to pay them off.\"\n\n\"Do you have names?  Who?\"  Tyrone's took an immediate interest.\n\n\"Let  me  see if I have'm here,\" he said as he  reached  for  his\nsmall  notebook in the sports jacket draped over the back of  his\nchair.   \"Yeah,  he  only gave me three, not much to  go  on.   A\nFaulkner,  some  banker  from L.A., a Wall  Street  tycoon  named\nHenson and another guy Dobbs, Franklin Dobbs.\"\n\n\"Dobbs!  How the hell do you know about Dobbs?\" Tyrone yelled  so\nloud  several remaining bar patrons looked over  to see what  the\nruckus was.\n\nScott  was taken aback by the outburst.  \"What're  you  hollering\nabout?\"\n\n\"Shit,  goddamned shit, I don't need this.\" Tyrone  finished  one\nand  ordered another drink.  He was keeping his promise; well  on\nthe  way to getting severely intoxicated.  \"Dobbs.  Dobbs is  the\npoor fucker that came into my office.\"\n\n\"You  saw  Dobbs?  He admitted it?\"  Scott's heart raced  at  the\nprospect of a connection.  Finally.\n\n\"Scott,\" Tyrone asked quietly, \"I have no right to ask you  this,\nbut  I will anyway. If you find anything, on Dobbs, can you  hold\nback? Just for a while?\"  A slight pleading on Tyrone's part.\n\n\"Why?\"  Was this part of the unofficial trade with Ty for earlier\ninformation?\n\nThe  waiter  returned with the credit card.   Tyrone  signed  the\nslip,  giving the waiter entirely too much of a tip.  \"I'll  tell\nyou on the train.  Let's go.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"To your house.  You have a computer, don't you?\"\n\n\"Yeah . . .\"\n\n\"Well, let's see if we can find out who the other 25 are.\"\n\nThey took a cab from the Scarsdale station to Scott's house.   No\npoint  in ending up in the clink for a DUI, even with  a  Federal\nAgent in tow.  Scott's study was in such disarray that he  liter-\nally  scraped off books and papers from the couch onto the  floor\nto  find Ty a place to sit and he piled up bigger piles of  files\nto make room for their beers on one of his desks.\n\nScott and Tyrone hadn't by any means sobered up on the train, but\ntheir thinking was still eminently clear.  During the hour  ride,\nthey reviewed what they knew.\n\nSeveral  prominent businessmen were being  actively  blackmailed.\nIn  addition,  the  blackmailer, or a  confederate,  was  feeding\ninformation  to the media.  At a minimum the Times, and  probably\nthe Expos\u001b\u0002\n.  Perhaps other media as well were in receipt of simi-\nlar information, but legitimate news organizations couldn't  have\nmuch to do with it in its current form.\n\nPresumably  then, like Scott, other reporters were calling  names\nin  the files.  Tyrone reasoned that such an exercise might be  a\nwell planned maneuver on the part of the perpetrators.\n\n\"Think  about it this way,\" he said.  \"Let's say you get  a  call\nfrom  someone  who says they know something about  you  that  you\ndon't want them to.  That'll shake you up pretty good, won't it?\"\nScott  rapidly agreed.  \"Good.  And the nature of the contact  is\nthreatening,  not directly, perhaps, but the undercurrent  leaves\nno doubt that the caller is not your best friend.  Follow?\"\n\n\"And  then,\" Scott picked up, \"a guy like me calls with the  same\ninformation.  The last person in the world he wants to know about\nhis  activities is a reporter, or to see it show up in the  news,\nso he really freaks.\"\n\n\"Exactly!\" Tyrone slapped his thigh.  \"And, if he gets more  than\none call, cardiac arrest is nearby. Imagine it.  Makes for a good\ncase of justifiable paranoia.\"\n\nTyrone nodded vigorously.  \"I've been in this game long enough to\nsee the side effects  of blackmail and extortion.  The psycholog-\nical effects can be devastating.  An inherent distrust of strang-\ners  is common.  Exaggerated delusions occur in many cases.   But\nthink  about this.  If we're right, you begin to distrust  every-\none, your closest friends, business associate, even your  family.\nSuddenly,  everyone is a suspect.  Distrust runs rampant and  you\nbegin  to  feel a sense of isolation, aloneness.  It  feels  like\nyou're  fighting  the entire world alone.  Solitude  can  be  the\nworst punishment.\"\n\nThe  analysis was sound.  The far ranging implications had  never\noccurred to Scott.  To him it had been a simple case of extortion\nor blackmail using some high tech wizardry.  Now, suddenly  there\nwas a human element.  The personal pain that made the crime  even\nthat much more sinister.\n\n\"Well, we, I mean the FBI, have seven stake outs.  It's a  fairly\nsimple operation. Money drops in public places, wait and pick  up\nthe  guy who picks up the money.\"  Tyrone made it sound so  easy.\nScott wondered.\n\n\"I bet it isn't that simple,\" Scott challenged.\n\n\"No shit, it ain't,\"  Tyrone came back.\n\n\"So whaddya do?\"\n\n\"Pay and have another beer.\"  Tyrone tempered the seriousness  of\ntheir conversation.\n\nAs  Scott  got up to go the kitchen he called out, \"Hey,  I  been\nthinking.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\" Tyrone yelled.\n\nHe  popped a Bud and handed it to Tyrone.  \"Listen, I  know  this\nmay be left field, but let's think it through.\"  Scott sat behind\nhis  desk and put his feet on top of some books on the desk.   He\nleaned  back  and put  his hands behind his  head.   \"We've  been\ntalking about the front end of this thing, the front lines  where\nthe  victims are actually being blackmailed.  The kind  of  stuff\nthat makes headlines.\"  Scott smiled devilishly at Ty who made  a\nsignificant  hand  gesture in return.  \"And  now  you're  talking\nabout  how to catch them when they pick up the money.   Have  you\nthought of the other side?\"\n\n\"What other side?\"  Tyrone was still confused by Scott's logic.\n\n\"Assume  for a moment that all this information is really  coming\nfrom computers.  The CMR. Ok?\"  Ty grudgingly shrugged his shoul-\nders.   \"Ok, you said that there are 7 cases across the  country.\nDobbs  said  he  knew of more here. Right?  Well,  who  gets  the\ninformation?\"\n\nConfusion showed on Tyrone's face. \"Gets the information?\"\n\n\"Yeah,  who runs around the country listening in  on  computers?\"\nThe question had been obvious to Scott.   All of sudden  Tyrone's\nface lit up.\n\n\"You mean the van?\"\n\n\"Right.   How  many  vans would it take to  generate  all  this?\"\nScott pointed at  several boxes next to the disorganized shelves.\n\n\"Damned if I know!\"\n\n\"Neither do I, but I'll make a wild guess and say that there  are\nquite  a few running around.  One blew up, or more  specifically,\nwas blown up.  You guys have the pieces.\"\n\n\"Not  any more,\" Ty said. \"They were taken away by CI .  Said  it\nwas  national security .  I was told to stay away from it.   Told\nyou about us Feds.\"\n\n\"Whatever,\" Scott waved away the sidebar.  \"The point is that  if\na  whole bunch of these vans were used, that's not  cheap.   They\nheld  a lot of very expensive equipment.   Why not look  for  the\nvans?   They  can't  be that hard to  find.   Maybe  you'll  find\nyour . . . \"\n\n\"Holy  Christ,  Mother Mary and Joseph, why didn't  I  think   of\nthat.\"   Tyrone stood up and aimlessly meandered amongst  Scott's\njunk heaps.  \"We've been looking in one direction only.  The  van\nceased to exist in our minds since CI took it. The Government can\nbe a royal pain in the ass.  The van, of course.\"\n\nJust as Scott was going to describe how to find villains  without\nwasting  hundreds  of  hours scouring data  banks,  his  computer\nbeeped  three times.  Scott was shaken from his  comfort.   \"What\nthe  .  .  .?\"  He looked at the clock.  It  was  just  midnight.\nKirk!  Kirk was calling and he totally had forgotten  to  mention\nthe computer ransacking to Ty.\n\n\"Great!  It's Kirk. I wanted you to meet him.\"  As  Scott  leaned\nover  the keyboard to answer the page, Tyrone looked  quizzically\nat him.\n\n\"Who's Kirk?\"\n\n\"This hacker, some kid on the West Coast.  He's taught me a  lot.\nGood  guy.  Hope to meet him someday.\" Scott pushed a  few  keys.\nThe screen came alive.\n\nWTFO\n\n\"Hey,\" said Tyrone, \"that's what we used to say in the Reserves.\"\n\nGotta Spook here.\n\nSPOOK? YOU KNOW SPOOK?\n\nWho's Spook?\n\nYOU SAID HE'S WITH YOU\n\nNot Spook, a spook.  FBI guy.\n\nFBI?  YOU PROMISED.\n\nDon't worry. Tell him yourself. Who is Spook, anyway?\n\nSPOOK IS A HACKER, ONE OF THE BEST.  BEEN ON THE SCENE FOR YEARS.\nA FEW PEOPLE CLAIM TO HAVE MET HIM, BUT IT'S ALWAYS A FRIEND OF A\nFRIEND OF A FRIEND. HE KEEPS A LOW PROFILE. THE WORD IS SPOOK  IS\nPLAYING SOME GOOD GAMES RECENTLY.  THE FBI?\n\nHe's a friend.  He doesn't know.\n\nTyrone  had come over to the crowded desk to watch the  exchange.\n\"Who is this guy?  What don't I know?\"\n\nKirk, can I tell him?  No one knows who you are?\n\nI GUESS SO.\n\nBe back . . .\n\nScott  proceeded  to  tell Tyrone about the  warnings  that  Kirk\nreceived  and  then how his computers were destroyed.   That  the\ncalling card warned Kirk to stay away from First State Bank.  And\nhow  another  hacker  calling himself Da Vinci on  a  BBS  called\nFreedom might be a link.  Then Scott admitted that he had been in\non  a  bank robbery, or at least breaking and entering  a  bank's\ncomputer.\n\nTyrone  had enough.  \"I'm not sure I want to hear  anymore.   You\nhave been busy.  So what can I do?\"\n\n\"Tell Kirk what he can do,\" Scott said.\n\n\"He could probably go to jail.  Bank computers, my God!  Is  that\nwhere you get your stories? You live them and then report them in\nthe third person? Stories for the inquiring mind.\"\n\n\"Are  you through! I mean, are you through?\"  Scott sounded  per-\nturbed.\n\n\"It's true. What does this guy want?\"\n\n\"Advice.  Talk to him.  Here.\"  Scott motioned for Tyrone to  sit\nat the keyboard.\n\n\"What do I do?\"\n\n\"Just type,\" Scott said with exasperation.  \"You're as bad as  my\nmother.  Type!\" Scott ordered.\n\nThis is Ty\n\nScott  pulled  Ty's  hands from the keyboard. \"A  handle,  use  a\nhandle, like on a CB!\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah, I forgot,\" Tyrone lied.\n\nThis is the FBI\n\nScott  looked on in shock. Tyrone laughed out loud.  \"He  already\nknows who  I am. So what? I've always liked saying that anyway.\"\n\nKIRK HERE, FBI, WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE\n\nSo I hear. Been to any good banks lately?\n\nREPO MAN, WHAT'S UP?\n\nCan't take a joke?\n\nYEAH.  NO PROBLEM.\n\nListen, I don't know you from Adam, and you don't have to talk to\nme, but I am curious.  Did your computers really get bashed?\n\nTOTALLY, DUDE.\n\nTyrone pointed his thumb at the computer.  \"Wise guy, eh?\"\n\n\"Give him a chance.  Generation gap.\"  Tyrone didn't take  kindly\nto references to his age. Sensitive area.\n\nWhy?\n\nCAUSE SOMEONE THINKS I KNOW SOMETHING THAT I DON'T\n\nThat's clear.\n\nTHANKS\n\nDo you want to make a formal complaint?\n\nWOULD IT DO ANY GOOD?\n\nNo.\n\nTHEN, NO\n\nYou think it was First State?\n\nYES.\n\nDon't you go around poking into other computers, too?\n\nSURE\n\nSo why not someone else?\n\nTHEY DIDN'T GET INTO BIG TROUBLE FROM REPO MAN'S ARTICLE?\n\n\"He knows who you are?\"  Tyrone asked.\n\n\"Sure.   He likes calling me Repo Man for some reason that  still\nescapes me.\n\nWhere else do you go?\n\nTHAT WOULD BE TELLING\n\nGotcha.  Well, I guess that's about it.\n\nPHEW!\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION\u000f     TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\n\"I guess you scared him off.\" Scott was amused.\n\n\"Sorry,\" Tyrone said.\n\n\"He'll call back,\" Scott waved off the apology.  \"When the  coast\nis clear.\"\n\n\"Fuck off.\"  Their friendship was returning to the level it  once\nhad been.\n\n\"Hey, it's getting beyond late,\" Scott ignored him.  \"What say we\nget together in a few days and sort through some of this.\"\n\n\"I  know, but one thing. Can you get into your computers, at  the\npaper?\"\n\n\"Yeah, why?\"\n\n\"Dobbs  said that the other victims had had their stock  go  down\npretty  dramatically.  Can you look up stock prices and  perform-\nances over the last few months?\"\n\n\"Yeah, do it all the time.\"\n\n\"Could you?  I want to see if there are any names I recognize.\"\n\n\"No  problem.\"  Scott dialed the Times' computer  and  identified\nhimself.   After  going into the bank computer with  Kirk,  every\ntime  he  dialed  up his office, he felt an  increased  sense  of\npower,  and an increased sense of responsibility.  He had  access\nto  massive amounts of information that if it got into the  wrong\nhands . . .\n\nHe shook the thought.  The computer offered the 'Stocks and Bonds\nMenu' and Scott set up a query in a modified SQL that was  simple\nenough for reporters to use:\n\n     ALL STOCKS LOSING 35% OR MORE OF VALUE IN LAST YEAR.\n\nThe  computer flashed a message. 'Working'.  Scott  leaned  back.\n\"Takes  a  few seconds.  Oh, as I was saying, when  I  get  back,\nI'll call and we'll see what we can screw together.\"\n\n\"Back from where?\"  Tyrone sounded accusatory but jealous.\n\n\"Europe.   Amsterdam.\" Scott checked the computer screen. It  was\nstill busy.\n\n\"Rough life.\"\n\n\"No,  it's only for a couple of days.  There's a hackers  confer-\nence.  I've been invited, by Kirk as a matter of fact.\"\n\n\"Hackers  conference, sounds like tons of fun.\"  Tyrone  was  not\nimpressed.\n\n\"The best hackers in the world are going to be there.  I hope  to\nget  some leads on the First State mess.  The Freedom BBS is  not\nall it seems.\"\n\n\"Please stay in touch,\" Tyrone implored.\n\n\"Sure.   Here we go.  It's ready.  Ah, let's see, there  are  267\ncompanies who meet that criterion.  I guess that narrows it  down\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Smart ass.  Ah, can you get those in New York only?\"\n\n\"The city? Sure.\"\n\n     SORT BY ZIP 100XX\n\n\"That'll give us . . .\"\n\n\"I  know what it means.\"  Tyrone shut Scott up in  mock  defense.\nIn  reality he didn't know much about computers, but some  things\nwere obvious even to the technically naive.\n\n\"That was fast,\" said Scott. \"Only 17. Help any?\"\n\n\"Might. Can I get that on paper?\"\n\nScott gave him the printout of the finances on the several unfor-\ntunate  companies  who had lost more than a third  of  their  net\nworth in the last year.  Tyrone folded it into his jacket pocket.\n\"Hey, call me a cab.  I'm too drunk to walk.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Wednesday, December 30\n     Lenox, Georgia\n\nA  faded blue Ford Econoline van sat in the Lenox Square  parking\nlot.   The  affluent Atlanta suburb had been  targeted  from  the\nbeginning.  Demographically ,it fit the bill to a tee.\n\nFrom  the  outside, the van looked like a thousand  other  parked\ncars; empty, with their owners shopping in the huge mall.  On the\ninside  though, two men were intently operating a vast  array  of\nelectronic equipment.\n\n\"Here  comes another one,\" said the first.  \"How many  does  that\nmake today?\"\n\n\"A  hundred  and  forty seven.  Let's do  it.\"   The  second  man\nwatched  the  enhanced color video image on a small  monitor.   A\nwell  dressed  lady walked up to the ATM machine, card  in  hand.\nThe  first man pressed a switch on another monitor and  the  snow\nfilled  picture  was transformed into an electronic copy  of  the\nATM's video display.\n\nPlease Insert Card\n\nThe screen in the van echoed the ATM screen.\n\n\"Can you tune it in a bit?\" asked the first man. \" It's a  little\nfuzzy.\"\n\n\"Yeah,  we must have settled.  Let me adjust the  antenna.\"   His\nhand  grabbed  a joystick on one of the tightly packed  racks  of\nequipment  and  gingerly moved it from left to right.   \"Is  that\nbetter?\"   A  small  disguised antenna on the  roof  of  the  van\naligned itself as the joystick commanded.\n\n\"Yeah . . .no . . .yeah, back again . . .\"\n\n\"I see it. There.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n     Enter Personal Identification Number:\n\nA  third monitor over the second man's cramped desk came to  life\nas the number 3435 appeared across his screen.\n\n\"Got it.  You, too?\"\n\n\"On disk and saved.\"\n\n\"I'll back it up.\"\n\n\"Better not.  Here comes another one.\"\n\n\"Busy day.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt was a very busy day.  Ahmed Shah saw to it that his  followers\nwere kept busy, six days a week.  As they had been for months.\n\nWhen  his army of a hundred plus Econoline vans were not  raiding\nthe  contents  of  unsuspecting computers during  the  day,  they\nbecame  electronic  ears which listened in on  the  conversations\nbetween the ATM's and their bank customers.\n\nAhmed's vans were used most efficiently.  On the road, doing  his\nbidding  twenty  four  hours a day, every day  but  the  Sabbath.\nAhmed  created cells of eight loyal  anti-American  sympathizers,\nregardless of nationality, to operate with each van.  Each  group\noperated as an independent entity with only one person from  each\nable to communicate privately with Ahmed over cellular modem.  No\ncell knew of any other cell.  If one group was apprehended,  they\ncouldn't tell what they didn't know.  Therefore, the rest of  the\ncells remain intact.\n\nAbsolute  loyalty was an unquestioned assumption for all  members\nof  Ahmed's  electronic  army.  It had to be that  way,  for  the\nbigger cause.\n\nAll  day  and night one of Ahmed Shah's computers in his  lab  at\nColumbia  received constant calls from his cell leaders.   During\nthe  day  it was the most interesting information that  they  had\ncaptured  from computer screens.  At night, it was the  passcodes\nto automatic bank tellers machines and credit card information.\n\nOnce  the  passcodes were in hand, making fake ATM  cards  was  a\ntrivial task.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                    Chapter 18\n\n     Wednesday, January 6\n     Amsterdam, Holland\n\nScott  Mason  had a theory.  It didn't matter than  no  one  else\nbelieved it, or that they thought him daffy.  It worked for him.\n\nHe  believed that jet lag was caused by the human body  traveling\nacross  mystical  magnetic force fields called  Ley  lines.   The\nphysics  of his theory made common sense to anyone but  a  scien-\ntist.   It  went like this: the body is  electric  and  therefore\nmagnetic  fields can influence it.  Wherever we live we are  sub-\nject  to  the  local influence of magnetic,  electrical  and  Ley\nlines.  If we move too quickly, as by plane, through  Ley  lines,\nthe  balance of our system is disturbed. The more Ley  lines  you\ntraverse, the more upsetting it is to the system.  Thus, jet lag.\n\nBut, Scott had a solution. Or more accurately, his mother had one\nwhich she had convinced him of years earlier. Scott carried  with\nhim  a  small box, the size of a pack of cigarettes, that  had  a\nswitch  and a blinking light.  It was called an  Earth  Resonance\nGenerator,  or  ERG.  The literature said the ERG  established  a\nnegative  gravity field through a magnetic Mobius  loop.   Inside\nthe box was a battery, a loop of wire, a light emitting diode and\nthe  back  side of the switch.  In short, nothing  of  electronic\nconsequence  or obvious function. There was no way in  hell  that\nthis  collection  of passive components could do  anything  other\nthan wear out batteries.  All for $79.95 plus $4 shipping.\n\nScott  first heard his mother proselytize about the magic of  the\nERG  when he was ten or twelve.  His father, the role  model  for\nArchie  Bunker ignored her completely and said her  rantings  in-\ncreased  with  certain lunar phases.  Since his  father  wouldn't\nlisten to her any longer, she endlessly lectured Scott about  the\nvirtues of the ERG whenever she returned from a trip.  His father\nrefused to travel, and had never even been on a plane.\n\nHis mother so persisted in her belief that she even tried experi-\nments.  On  one  of her trips to Rome,  she  somehow  talked  the\nstewardesses  into  handing  out  the  400  questionnaires  she'd\nbrought  with  her onto the plane.  It asked the  passengers  how\nthey  felt after the flight, and if they do anything  special  to\navoid  jet lag.  She claims more than 200 were returned and  that\nthey  overwhelmingly indicated that no one felt jet lag  on  that\ntrip.\n\nShe  attributed  this immense success to the  ERG  effects  which\npurportedly spread over one acre.  In other words, the ERG  takes\ncare of an entire 747 or L-1011 or DC-10.\n\nFor years Scott successfully used the ERG to avoid jet lag.  Some\npeople put brown paper bags in their shoes, others eat yogurt and\nbean  sprouts before a long flight.  Maybe his solution was  psy-\nchosomatic, Scott admitted to anyone who asked, but, so what?  It\nstill  works, doesn't it?  Scott was forever impressed that  air-\nport security had never, once, asked him what this little  blink-\ning black box was.  Scary thought.\n\nHe arrived completely refreshed via KLM at the Amsterdam Interna-\ntional  Airport  at 9:15 A.M.  While he had been to  Europe  many\ntimes,  he had thus far missed the Amsterdam experience.  He  had\nheard that pot was legal in Amsterdam.  In fact it was more  than\nlegal.  Every morning the marijuana prices were broadcast on  the\nlocal  radio stations and Scott had every intention  of  sampling\nthe  wares.   After 20 years of casual pot use, he  preferred  it\nimmensely  to  the effects of drinking, and he was not  going  to\nmiss out on the opportunity.\n\nIn  New  York no one harassed pot smokers,  but  technically,  it\nstill  wasn't  legal, while Amsterdam  represented  the  ultimate\ncounterculture.   This was the first time since Maggie  had  left\nfor the Coast three years ago that Scott felt an independence,  a\nfreedom reminiscent of his rebellious teen years.\n\nHe gave the taxi driver the address of the Eureka! hotel, on  the\nAmstel.   During the half hour fifty guilder ride into  downtown,\nthe  driver continuously chattered.  \"Amsterdam has  more  canals\nthan  Venice.  Many more.  Holland is mostly land reclaimed  from\nthe  sea. We have the biggest system of dikes in  Europe.   Don't\nforget to see our diamond centers.\"  He spoke endlessly with deep\npride about his native land.\n\nThe  Eureka! is a small four story townhouse with only  16  rooms\nthat  overlooked  the  Amstel, the largest  canal  in  Amsterdam,\nsimilar to the Grand Canal in Venice.    The Times had booked  it\nbecause  it was cheap, but Scott felt instantly at  home.   After\nsettling  in, Scott called the local number that Kirk  had  given\nhim.\n\n\"Hallo?\"  A thick Dutch accent answered the phone.\n\n\"Hello?  I'm looking for Jon Gruptmann? This is Scott Mason.\"\n\n\"Ya, this is Jon.\"\n\n\"A mutual friend, Kirk, said I should call you.\"\n\n\"Ah, ya, ya.  Repo Man, is it not?\"  The voice got friendly.\n\n\"That's what Kirk calls me.\"\n\n\"Ya,  ya.  He said you want to attend our meetings.  Ya? Is  that\nso?\"   Jon sounded enthusiastic.\n\n\"That's  why  I swam the Atlantic, all three thousand  miles.   I\nwould love to!\"  Jon didn't sound like Scott expected a  computer\nhacker to sound, whatever that was.\n\n\"Huh?\" Jon asked.  \"Ah, ya, a joke.  Goot. Let me tell you  where\nwe meet.  The place is small, so it may be very crowded.  I  hope\nyou do not mind.\"  Jon sounded concerned about Scott's comfort.\n\n\"Oh, no.  I'm used to inconvenience. I'm sure it will be fine.\"\n\n\"Ya,  ya.   I expect so.  The meetings don't really  begin  until\ntomorrow at 9AM.  Is that goot for you?\"\n\n\"Yes,  just fine, what's the address?\" Scott asked as he  readied\npaper and pen.\n\n\"Ya.   Go to the warehouse on the corner of Oude  Zidjs  Voorburg\nWal  and  Lange Niezel.  It's around from  the  Oude  Kerksplein.\nNumber 44.\"\n\n\"Hold it, I'm writing.\" Scott scribbled the address phonetically.\nA necessary trick reporters use when someone is speaking unintel-\nligibly.  \"And then what?\"\n\n\"Just say you're Repo Man.  There's a list.  And please remember,\nwe don't use our given names.\"\n\n\"No problem. Fine.  Thank you.\"\n\n\"Ya. What do you plan for tonight?\" Jon asked happily.\n\n\"I hadn't really thought about it,\" Scott lied.\n\n\"Ya, ya.  Well, I think you should see our city. Enjoy the unique\npleasures Amsterdam has to offer.\"\n\n\"I might take a walk . . . or something.\"\n\n\"Ya,  ya, or something. I understand.  I will see  you  tomorrow.\nYa?\"  Jon said laughing.\n\n\"Wouldn't miss it for the world.\"\n\n\"Do  one favor?\"  Jon asked.  \"Watch your wallet.  We  have  many\npickpockets.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the warning.  See you tomorrow.\"  Click. I grew up in\nNew York, Scott thought.  Pickpockets, big deal.\n\n* * * * *\n\nScott  took  a shower to remove the vestiges of the  eleven  hour\ntrip; an hour ride to Kennedy, an hour and a half at the airport,\na half hour on the tarmac, seven hours on the plane, and an  hour\ngetting into town.\n\nHe dressed casually in the American's travel uniform: jeans, jean\njacket  and warm sweater.  He laced his new Reeboks knowing  that\nAmsterdam  is  a  walking city. Driving would  be  pure  insanity\nunless  the goal is sitting in two hour traffic jams. The  single\nlane  streets straddle the miles of canals throughout  the  inner\ncity  which is arranged in a large semi-circular pattern.   Down-\ntown, or old Amsterdam, is a dense collection of charming  clean,\nalmost pristine 4 story buildings built over a period of  several\nhundred  years.  That's the word for Amsterdam;  charming.   From\nlate medieval religious structures to townhouses that are tightly\npacked  on almost every street, to the various Pleins  where  the\nyoung crowds congregate in the evenings, Amsterdam has  something\nfor  everyone.  Anne Frank's house to the Rembrandt Museum  to  a\nglass  roofed boat trip down the canals through the diamond  dis-\ntrict and out into the Zeider Zee.  Not to mention those  attrac-\ntions for the more prurient.\n\nHe  ran  down the two flights to the hotel lobby  and  found  the\nconcierge behind the Heineken bar which doubled as a registration\ndesk.  He wanted to know where to buy some pot.\n\n\"Not to find us selling that here,\" the Pakistani concierge  said\nin broken English.\n\n\"I  know.  But where . . .\"  It was an odd feeling to  ask  which\nstore sold drugs.\n\n\"You want Coffee Shop,\" he helpfully said.\n\n\"Coffee Shop?\"  Scott asked, skeptical of the translation.\n\n\"Across bridge, make right, make left.\"  The concierge  liberally\nused his hands to describe the route. \"Coffee shop.  Very good.\"\n\nScott  thanked him profusely and made a quick exit thinking  that\nin  parts of the U.S., Texas came to mind,  such  a  conversation\ncould  be construed as conspiracy.  He headed out into  the  cool\ndamp late morning weather.  The air was crisp, clean, a  pleasure\nto  breathe  deeply.   The Amstel canal, not  a  ripple  present,\nechoed the tranquility that one feels when walking throughout the\ncity.  There are only a half dozen or so 'main' streets or boule-\nvards in Amsterdam and they provide the familiar intense interna-\ntional  commercialism  found in any major European city.   It  is\nwhen one begins to explore the back streets, the countless alleys\nand  small  passageways; the darkened corridors  that  provide  a\nshort  cut to the bridge to the next islet; it is then  that  one\nfeels the essence of Amsterdam.\n\nScott  crossed  over the bridge that spans the wide  Amstel  con-\nscious  of the small high speed car and scooters that dart  about\nthe tiny streets. He turned right as instructed and looked at the\nstreet  names on the left.  While Scott spoke reasonable  French,\nDutch escaped him.  Bakkerstraat.  Was that the name? It was just\nan  alley,  but there a few feet down on the right  was  the  JPL\nCoffee  Shop.  JPL was the only retail establishment  on  Bakker-\nstraat,  and it was unassuming, some might call it  derelict,  in\nappearance.  From a distance greater than 10 meters, it  appeared\ndeserted.\n\nThrough the large dirty plate glass window Scott saw a handful of\npatrons  lazing on white wrought iron cafe chairs at small  round\ntables.   The  Coffee Shop was no larger than  a  small  bedroom.\nHere goes nothing, Scott thought as he opened the door to  enter.\nNo one paid scant attention to him as he crossed over and  leaned\non the edge of the bar which was reminiscent of a soda  fountain.\nA man in his young twenties came over and amiably introduced him-\nself  as Chris, the proprietor of the establishment. How could he\nbe of service?\n\n\"Ah . . . I heard I can buy marijuana here,\" Scott said.\n\n\"Ya, of course. What do you want?\" Chris asked.\n\n\"Well,  just  enough for a couple of days, I can't take  it  back\nwith me you know,\" Scott laughed nervously.\n\n\"Ya.  We also have cocaine, and if you need it, I can get you he-\nroin.\"  Chris  gave  the sales pitches verbally -  there  was  no\nprinted menu in this Coffee Shop.\n\n\"No!\"  Scott  shot back immediately, until he realized  that  all\ndrugs  were legal here, not just pot.  He didn't want to  offend.\n\"Thanks anyway.  Just some grass will do.\"\n\n\"How many grams do you want?\"\n\nGrams?  How  many grams? Scott mused that  the  metric  Europeans\nthought in grams and Americans still in ounces and pounds.  O.K.,\n28 grams to an ounce . . .\n\n\"Two  grams,\" Scott said.  \"By the way, how late are  you  open?\"\nScott pushed his rounded spectacles back up his nose.\n\n\"Ah, sometimes 8, sometimes 10, sometimes late,\" Chris said while\nbringing  a tissue box sized lock box to the top of the bar.   He\nopened  it  and inside were several bags of pot and  a  block  of\naluminum foil the size of a candy bar. \"You want hashish?\"  Chris\noffered.\n\nScott  shook his head, 'no,' so Chris opened one of the bags  in-\nstead of the candy bar.\n\n\"You  American?\"   A  voice came from one of  the  tables.  Scott\nlooked  around.  \"Here,\" the voice said.  \"Me too.\"  The man  got\nup  and approached Scott.  \"Listen, they got two types  of  ganja\nhere. Debilitating and Coma.  I've made the mistake.\"\n\n\"Ya, we have two kinds,\" Chris agreed laughing.  \"This will  only\nget you a little high,\" he said holding up a bag.  \"This one,\" he\nheld up another, \"will get you stoned.\"\n\n\"Bullshit,\"  the American said.  \"Their idea of a little high  is\ncatatonic  for  us.  Take my word for it.  The  Mexican  shit  we\nsmoke?  They'd give it to the dogs.\"\n\n\"You  sold  me,\" Scott said holding his hands  up  in  surrender.\n\"Just  a little high is fine by me.  Two grams, please,\" he  said\nto Chris pointing at the less potent bag.  \"Thanks for the  warn-\ning,\" he said to the American.  \"Where you from?\"  Scott asked.\n\n\"Oh, around.  I guess you could call Washington my home.\"\n\n\"D.C.?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the American nodded.  \"And you?\"  He leaned over the back\nof his chair to face Scott.\n\n\"Big Apple.  The 'burbs.\"\n\n\"What brings you here?\"\n\n\"To Europe?\" Scott asked.\n\n\"Amsterdam.  Sin City.  Diamonds?\"\n\n\"No, I wish,\" Scott laughed.  \"News. A story brought me here  for\na couple of days.\"\n\nChris  finished weighing Scott's purchase on a sensitive  digital\nscale that measured the goods down to the nearest hundredth of  a\ngram.   Scott handed Chris $10 in Guilders and pocketed the  pot.\n\"Um,  where can I get some papers?\"  Scott asked.  Chris  pointed\nto  a  glass  on the bar with a complete  selection  of  assorted\nparaphernalia.\n\n\"Hey, why don't you join me,\" the American asked.  \"I've been  to\nAmsterdam before.\"\n\n\"Is it all right to smoke in here?\" Scott asked looking around.\n\n\"Sure,  that's what coffee shops are.  The only other  thing  you\ncan buy in here is sodas.  No booze.\"  The American spoke  confi-\ndently as he lit up a joint and passed it to Scott.\n\n\"Thanks,\" Scott coughed as he handed it back.  \"Oh, I don't think\nI caught your name.\n\n\"Oh, just call me Spook.\"\n\nTHE Spook? thought Scott.  What incredible synchronicity.\n\nScott's body instantly tensed up and he felt the adrenaline  rush\nwith  an associated rise in pulse rate. Was this really the  leg-\nendary Spook?\n\nIs it possible that he fell into a chance meeting with the hacker\nthat  Kirk  and  his friends refer to as  the  king  of  hackers?\nSpook?  Gotta stay cool.  Could he be that lucky?  Was there more\nthan  one spook?   Scott momentarily daydreamed, remembering  how\nfifteen years before, in Athens, Greece he had opened a taxi door\nright into the face a lady who turned out to be an ex-high-school\ngirl friend.  It is a small world, Scott thought tritely.\n\n\"Spook?   Are you a spy?\" Scott comically asked, careful to  dis-\nguise his real interest.\n\n\"If  I answer that I'll have to kill you,\" the Spook laughed  out\nloud  in  the  quiet establishment. \"Spy?  Hardly.  It's  just  a\nhandle.\"  Spook said guardedly.  \"What's yours?\"\n\n\"Mine?  Oh,  my handle.  They call me Repo Man, but  it's  really\nScott Mason. Glad to meet you.  Spook,\" he added handing back the\nintoxicating cigarette.\n\nBINGO!  Scott Mason in hand without even a search.  Landing right\nin  his lap.  Keep your cool.  Dead pan poker face.   What  unbe-\nlievable luck.  Don't blow it, let's play this for all that  it's\nworth.   Your life just got very simple.  Give both Homosoto  and\nMason exactly what they want with no output of energy.\n\n\"You  said you're a reporter,\" Spook said inhaling deeply  again.\n\"What's the story?\"  At least he gets high, Spook thought.  Mason\ncould  have been a real dip-shit nerd.  Thank God for  small  fa-\nvors.\n\n\"There's  a hacker conference that I was invited to,\" Scott  said\nunabashedly.  \"I'm trying to show the hacker's side of the story.\nWhy they do what they do.  How they legitimize it to themselves.\"\nScott's  mouth was rapidly drying out so he ordered a Pepsi.   \"I\nassume you're a hacker, too,\" Scott broached the issue carefully.\n\nSpook smiled widely. \"Yup.  And proud of it.\"\n\n\"You don't care who knows?\" Scott asked looking around to see  if\nanyone  was paying attention to their conversation.  Instead  the\nother  patrons were engrossed in chess or  huddled  conversation.\nOnly Chris, the proprietor listened from behind the bar.\n\n\"The  Spook  is all anyone knows. I like to keep  it  that  way,\"\nSpook said as he laid the roach end of the joint in the  ashtray.\n\"Not bad, huh?\" He asked Scott.\n\n\"Christ, no.  Kinda hits you between the eyes.\" Scott rubbed them\nto clear off the invading fog.\n\n\"After  a  couple of days it won't get you so bad,\"  Spook  said.\n\"You said you wanted to do a fair story on hackers, right?\"\n\n\"Fair?   A fair story? I can only try.  If hackers act  and  talk\nlike  assholes then they'll come across like assholes, no  matter\nwhat I do.  However, if they make a decent case, hold a rational,\nalbeit arguable position, then maybe someone may listen.\"\n\n\"You sound like you don't approve of our activities.\"  The  Spook\ngrinned devilishly.\n\n\"Honestly,  and I shouldn't say this cause this is  your  grass,\"\nScott said lighting the joint again.  \"No, I don't approve, but I\nfigure there's at least 10 sides to a story, and I'm here to find\nthat story and present all sides.  Hopefully I can even line up a\ndebate  or two.  Convincing me is not the point; my readers  make\nup their own minds.\"\n\nThe word 'readers' momentarily jolted the Spook until he realized\nScott meant newspaper readers, not his team of Van-Ecking  eaves-\ndroppers.  Spook took the joint from Scott. \"You sound  like  you\ndon't want to approve.\"\n\n\"Having  a hard time with all the crap going down with  computers\nthese days,\" Scott agreed.  \"I guess my attitude comes through in\nmy articles.\"\n\n\"I've never read your stuff,\" Spook lied.\n\n\"Mainly in New York.\"\n\n\"That explains it.  Ever been to Amsterdam?\"\n\n\"No, I was going to get a map and truck around . . .\"\n\n\"How  about I show you around, and try to convince you about  the\nhonor of our profession?\"  Spook asked.\n\n\"Great!\"  Scott agreed. \"But what about . . .\"  He made a  motion\nto his lips as if he was holding a cigarette.\n\n\"Legal on the streets.\"\n\n\"You sure?\"\n\n\"C'mon,\"  Spook  said  rising from his  chair.  \"Chris,  see  you\nlater,\" he promised.  Chris reciprocated and invited his two  new\nfriends to return any time.\n\nScott followed Spook up the alley named Bakkerstraat and into the\nRembrandt Plein, a huge open square with cafes and street  people\nand hotels.  \"At night,\" Spook said, \"Rembrandt and another 4  or\n5  pleins are the social hub of activity for the younger  genera-\ntion.   Wished  I had had this when I was a kid.   How  are  your\nlegs?\"   The  Spook amorously ogled the throngs  of  young  women\ntwenty years his junior.\n\n\"Fine, why?\"\n\n\"I'm going to show you Amsterdam.\"\n\nScott and the Spook began walking. The Spook knew his way  around\nand  described much of the history and heritage of the city,  the\ncountry  and its culture.  This kind of educated hacker  was  not\nwhat  Scott  had expected.  He had thought that  today's  hackers\nwere nerds, the propeller heads of his day, but he was  discover-\ning through the Spook, that he may have been wrong.  Scott remem-\nbered  Clifford Stoll's Hanover Hacker was a well positioned  and\nseemingly  upstanding individual who was selling stolen  computer\ninformation  to the KGB.  How many nerds would have the  gumption\nto play in that league?\n\nThey  walked to the outer edge of Old Amsterdam, on  the  Singel-\ngracht  at  the Leidseplein.  Without a map or the  Spook,  Scott\nwould have been totally lost.  The streets and canals were all so\nsimilar that, as the old phrase goes, you can't tell the  players\nwithout a scorecard.   Scott followed the Spook onto an  electric\nstreet  car.   It headed down the Leidsestraat, one  of  the  few\nheavily commercial streets and across the Amstel again.\n\nThe  street car proceeded up the Nieuwezuds Voorburgwal,  a  wide\nboulevard  with  masses of activities on both  sides.   This  was\ntourist madness, thought Scott.\n\n\"This is freedom,\" said the Spook.\n\n\"Freedom?\"  The word instantly conjured his memory of the Freedom\nLeague,  the BBS he suspected was up to no-good.   The Spook  and\nFreedom?\n\n\"At  the end of this street is the Train Station.   Thousands  of\npeople come through this plaza every day to experience Amsterdam.\nGet  whatever it is out of their system.  The drugs,  the  women,\nthe  anarchy of a country that relies upon the integrity  of  its\npopulation  to  work. Can't you feel it?\"  The  Spook  positively\nglowed as he basked in the aura of the city.\n\nScott had indeed felt it during their several hours together.  An\nintense  sense  of independence that came from  a  generation  of\ndemocratic  socialism.   Government regulated  drugs,  a  welfare\nsystem  that  permitted the idle to live nearly as  well  as  the\nworking.   Class structures blurred by taxes  so  extraordinarily\nhigh  that  most everyone lived in similarly  comfortable  condi-\ntions.  Poverty is almost non-existent.\n\nYet, as the Spook explained to Scott, \"This is not the world  for\nan entrepreneur.  That distinction still belongs to the ol'  Red,\nWhite  and Blue.  It's almost impossible to make any  real  money\nhere.\"\n\nThe sun was setting behind the western part of the city, over the\nchurch steeples and endless rows of townhouses.\n\n\"Hungry yet?\" Spook grinned at Scott.\n\n\"Hungry?   I got a case of the munchies that won't  quit.   Let's\neat.\"  Scott's taste buds were entering panic mode.\n\n\"Good,\"  the Spook said as he lit up another joint on the  street\ncar.  \"Let's eat.\"  He hastily leapt off the slow moving vehicle.\nScott  followed him across the boulevard and dodged cars,  busses\nand  bicycles.  They stopped in front of a small Indonesian  res-\ntaurant, Sarang Mas, ably disguised with a red and white  striped\nawning and darkened windows.\n\n\"Ever had Indonesian food?\"\n\n\"No, well maybe, in New York I guess . . .\"\n\nMiles dragged Scott into the unassuming restaurant and the  calm-\ning  strains  of Eastern music replaced the city  noises  on  the\nstreet  outside. The red and white plastic checkered  tablecloths\nseverely  clashed with the gilt of the pagoda shaped  decorations\nthroughout.  But only by American tastes.  Sarang Mas was a  much\ntouted and reputable restaurant with very fine native  Indonesian\nchefs doing the preparations.\n\n\"Let  me tell you something,\" the Spook said.  \"This food is  the\nabsolute  finest  food available, anywhere in the world,  bar  no\nidyllic island location, better than a trip to Hershey,  Pennsyl-\nvania to cure a case of the munchies.  It's delicate, it's sweet,\nit's  taste bud heaven, it's a thousand points of  flavor  you've\nnever tried before.\"  The Spook sounded like a hawker on the Home\nShopping Network.\n\n\"Shut up,\" Scott joked.  \"You're just making it worse.\"\n\n\"Think  of  the oral orgasm that's coming.   Anticipation.\"   The\nwaiter had appeared and waited patiently.  It was still early and\nthe  first seating crowd was two hours away.  \"Do you mind  if  I\norder?\"\n\n\"No,  be  my guest.  Just make it fast food.  Super  fast  food,\"\nScott begged.\n\n\"Ah, let's have a couple of Sate Kambings to start, ah, and we'll\nshare some Daguig Goreng, and some Kodok Goreng and ah, the Guila\nKambing.   And,\" Spook looked at Scott, \"a couple of  Heinekens?\"\nScott nodded.  \"And, if there's any way you could put that  order\ninto  warp  drive, my friend here,\" he pointed at  Scott,  \"would\nappreciate it muchly.\"\n\n\"Very  good,\"  the dark skinned Indonesian waiter replied  as  he\nscurried back to the kitchen.\n\nIt  still took half an hour for the appetizers to arrive.   Scott\nchewed  up  three straws and tore two napkins into  shreds  while\nwaiting.\n\n\"What is this,\" asked Scott as he voraciously dove into the food.\n\n\"Does it matter?\"\n\n\"No,\"  Scott bit into it.  \"Mmmmmmm . . .Holy shit, that's  good,\nwhat is it?\"\n\n\"Goat parts,\" the Spook said with a straight face.\n\nScott  stopped  chewing. \"Which goat parts?\" he  mumbled  staring\nover the top of his round glasses.\n\n\"The good parts,\" said the Spook taking two big bites.  \"Only the\ngood parts.\"\n\n\"It's nothing like, eyeballs, or lips or . . .\"  Scott was gross-\ning himself out.\n\n\"No, no, paysan, eat up.  It's safe.\"  The Spook made the Italian\ngesture  for eating.  \"Most of the time.\"  The Spook chuckled  as\nhe ravaged the unidentifiable goat parts on his plate.\n\nScott looked suspiciously at the Spook, who seemed to be  surviv-\ning.  How bad could it be?  It tasted great, phenomenal, but what\nis it? Fuck it.  Scott wolfed down his goat parts in total ecsta-\nsy.  The Spook was right.  This was the best tasting food he  had\nhad, ever.\n\nThe rest of the meal was as sensorally exquisite as the  appetiz-\ner.   Scott felt relieved once the waiter had promised  that  the\ngoat  parts  were from a goat roast, just like a rib roast  or  a\npork roast.  Nothing disgusting like ear lobes. Ecch!\n\n\"So  you  want to know why we do it,\" said the Spook  in  between\nnibbles  of  Indonesian frog legs.  Scott had to  think  hard  to\nrealize that the Spook had shifted the conversation to hacking.\n\n\"It had occurred to me,\" responded Scott.  \"Why do you do it?\"\n\n\"I've  always  liked  biology,  so  hacking  became  the  obvious\nchoice,\"  Spook said laughing.  Scott looked perplexed  but  that\ndidn't interrupt his voracious attack on the indescribably  deli-\ncious foods on his plate.\n\n\"How old are you?\" Asked the Spook.\n\n\"The Big four-oh is in range.\"\n\n\"Good, me too. Remember Marshall McCluhan?\"\n\n\"The medium is the message guru.\"  Scott had admired him and made\nconsiderable  effort  to attend a few of  his  highly  motivating\nlectures.\n\n\"Exactly.  He predicted it 20 years early.  The Networked  Socie-\nty.\"  The  Spook paused to toss more food into his  mouth.   \"How\nmuch do you know about computers?\"\n\n\"I'm  learning,\" Scott said modestly.  Whenever asked that  ques-\ntion he assumed that he was truly ignorant on the subject despite\nhis  engineering  degree.  It was just that computers  had  never\nheld the fascination for him that they did for others.\n\n\"O.K.,  let me give you the low down.\" The Spook sucked down  the\nlast of the Heineken and motioned to the waiter for two more.  He\nwiped  his  lips and placed his napkin beside  the  well  cleaned\nplate.   \"At what point does something become alive?\"\n\n\"Alive?\" Scott mused.  \"When some carbon based molecules get  the\nright combination of gases in the proper proportions of  tempera-\nture and pressure . . .\"\n\n\"C'mon,  guy.  Use your imagination,\" the Spook scoffed with  his\neyes twinkling.  \"Biologically, you're right, but philosophically\nthat's  pretty  fucking  lame. Bart Simpson could  come  up  with\nbetter  than  that.\"  The Spook could be most  insulting  without\neven trying.  \"Let me ask you, is the traffic light system in New\nYork alive?\"\n\n\"No  way!\" Retorted Scott.  \"It's dead as a doornail,  programmed\nfor  grid  lock.\"   They both laughed at the  ironic  choice  for\nanalogy.\n\n\"Seriously,  in many ways it can be considered alive,\" the  Spook\nsaid.   \"It  uses  electricity as its source of  power  or  food.\nTherefore it eats, has a digestive system and has waste  product;\nheat.  Agreed?\"\n\nScott nodded.  That was a familiar personification for  engineer-\ning students.\n\n\"And, if you turn off the power, it stops functioning.  A  tempo-\nrary starvation if you will.  It interacts with its  environment;\nin  this case with sensors and switches that react to the  condi-\ntions at any particular moment.  And lastly, and most  important-\nly,  it  has purpose.\"  Scott raised  his  eyebrows  skeptically.\n\"The program, the rules, those are its purpose.  It is coinciden-\ntally the same purpose that its designers had, but nonetheless it\nhas purpose.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make it alive. It can't think, as we do, and  there\nis no ego or personality,\" Scott said smugly.\n\n\"So  what?   Since when does plankton or slime mold  join  Mensa?\nThat's sentience.\"  Spook walked right over Scott's comment.\n\n\"O.K.,\"  Scott acquiesced.  \"I'm here to play  Devil's  Advocate,\nnot make a continent of enemies.\"\n\n\"Listen,  you better learn something early on,\" Spook  leaned  in\nover the table.  His seriousness caught Scott's attention.   \"You\ncan  disagree  with us all you want, that's not a  problem,  most\neveryone does.  But, we do expect fairness, personal and  profes-\nsional.\"\n\n\"Meaning?\"\n\n\"Meaning,\"  the dimples in Spook's smiling cheeks radiated  cama-\nraderie.   \"Don't give up on an argument so early if you  believe\nin it.  That's a chicken shit way out of taking a position.  Real\nkindergarten.\"  The Spook finished off his Heineken in two gulps.\n\nScott's tension eased realizing the Spook wanted the debate,  the\nconfrontation.   This  week could be a lot more fun than  he  had\nthought.\n\n\"At any rate, can you buy into that, that the traffic systems are\nalive?\" The Spook asked again.\n\n\"I'll hold my final judgment in abeyance, but for sake of discus-\nsion, let's continue,\" acquiesced Scott.\n\n\"Fair enough.  In 1947, I think that was the year, some guy  said\nthat  he doubted there would be world wide market for  more  than\nthree computers.\"\n\nScott choked on his beer.  \"Three?  Ha! What mental moron came up\nwith that?\"\n\n\"Watson.   Thomas  Watson, founder of IBM,\" the Spook  said  dead\npan.\n\n\"You're kidding.\"\n\n\"And what about Phil Estridge?\"\n\n\"Who's that?\"\n\n\"Another  IBM'er,\" said the Spook.  \"He was kind of  a  renegade,\nworked outside of the mainstream corporate IBM mold.  His  bosses\ntold  him,  'hey, we need a small cheap computer to  tie  to  our\nbigger computers.  This little company Apple is selling too  many\nfor  us not to get involved.  By the way, Corporate  Headquarters\nthinks  this  project  is a total waste of  money;  they've  been\nagainst  it from the outset.  So, you have 8 months.'  They  gave\nhim  8  months to build a computer that would set  standards  for\ngenerations of machines.  And, he pulled it off.  Damned shame he\ndied.\n\n\"So,  here  we have IBM miss-call two of the greatest  events  in\ntheir history yet they still found ways to earn tens of  billions\nof dollars.  Today we have, oh, around a hundred million  comput-\ners  in  the world.  That's a shitload of computers.   And  we're\ncranking out twelve million more each year.\n\n\"Then we tied over fifty million of these computers together.  We\nused  local  area networks, wide area networks,  dedicated  phone\nlines,  gate  ways, transmission backbones all in  an  effort  to\nallow  more and more computers to talk to each other.   With  the\nphone company as the fabric of the interconnection of our comput-\ners we have truly become a networked society.  Satellites further\ntighten  the weave on the fabric of the Network.   With  a  modem\nand telephone you have the world at your fingertips.\"  The  Spook\nraised his voice during his passionate monologue.\n\n\"Now  we can use computers in our cars or boats and use  cellular\nphone  links  to create absolute networkability.  In  essence  we\nhave  a  new life form to deal with, the world  wide  information\nNetwork.\"\n\n\"Here's  where we definitely diverge,\" objected Scott,  hands  in\nthe air.  \"Arriving at the conclusion that a computer network  is\na  life form, requires a giant leap of faith that I have  trouble\nwith.\"\n\n\"Not  faith, just understanding,\" the Spook said  with  sustained\nvigor.   \"We can compare networks to the veins and blood  vessels\nin  our bodies.  The heart pumps the blood, the  lungs  replenish\nit,  the  other organs feed off of it.  The veins  serve  as  the\nthoroughfares  for blood just as networks serve as  highways  for\ninformation.   However, the Network is not static, where a  fixed\nroad  map describes its operation.  The Network is in a  constant\nstate of flux, in all likelihood never to repeat the same pattern\nof connections again.\n\n\"So you admit,\" accused Scott, \"that a network is just a conduit,\none made of copper and silicon just as the vein in a conduit?\"\n\n\"Yes, a smart conduit,\" the Spook insisted.   \"Some conduits  are\nmuch  smarter than others.  The Network itself is a set of  rules\nby  which information is transmitted over a conductive  material.\nYou can't touch a network.  Sure, you can touch the computer, the\nnetwork wire, you can touch the bits and pieces that make up  the\nNetwork, but you cannot touch the Network.  The Network exists as\na synergistic byproduct of many dissimilar and physically isolat-\ned devices.\"\n\n\"I must admit Spook . . .\"\n\n\"That's Mister Spook to you earth man,\" joked the Spook.  \"Sorry,\ncontinue.\"\n\n\"I  could probably nickel and dime you into death by  boredom  on\nseveral  points,  but I will concede that they are  arguable  and\nbetter  relegated for a long evening of total disagreement.   For\nthe sake of world peace I will not press the issue now.\"\n\n\"How very kind,\" mocked the Spook.  \"Let's get out of here,  take\na walk, and I'll continue your education.\"\n\nIf  anyone  else spoke to Scott so derogatorily, there  would  be\ninstant  conflict.  The Spook, though, didn't raise  the  defense\nmechanism  in  Scott.  Spook was actually a  likable  fellow,  if\nsomewhat arrogant.\n\nThey walked back down Nieuwezuds Voorburgwal and Beursplein  very\nslowly.  The Spook lit up another joint.\n\n\"What's this,\" said Scott appreciatively, \"an endless supply?\"\n\n\"When in Rome!\" replied Spook.  The brightly lit grand  boulevard\nwas  a  sample of the energy that permeates the  Amsterdam  night\nlife.   The  train  station was still a hub of  activity  in  the\nwinter darkness of early evening.\n\n\"So  look at the Network.  You can cut off its tentacles,  that's\nbetter  than legs and feet in this case, and they will  reappear,\nreconnect  somewhere  else.  Alternate routing  bypasses  trouble\nspots,  self diagnostics help the Network doctors,  priority  and\npreferences  are  handled  according to a clear  set  of  rules.\"\nSpook waved his hands to reinforce his case.\n\n\"That's, ah, quite, ah, a theory.  What do the experts say  about\nthis?\"  Scott was teetering on the edge of partial acceptance.\n\n\"Experts?   We're  the experts.  That's why we  hack,  don't  you\nsee?\"   The answer was so obvious it didn't deserve  a  question.\n\"Now,  I can only speak for myself, but I find that  the  Network\norganism itself is what's interesting.  The network, the  sponta-\nneously grown information organism that covers most of the planet\nEarth.  I believe that is why all hackers start hacking.   Innate\ncuriosity about the way things work.  Then, before our eyes,  and\nbehind the back of the world, the planet gets connected,  totally\nconnected  to each other, and we haven't examined  the  ramifica-\ntions  of that closeness, computer-wise that is. That's  what  we\ndo.\"  The Spook sounded satisfied with his explanation.\n\nScott thought about it as they crossed Kerksplein and over canals\nto  the Oude Zijds Voorbugwal.  Was the Spook spouting off a  lot\nof rationalized bullshit or were he and the likes of him actually\nperforming  valuable services, acting as  technological  sociolo-\ngists  to five billion clients?  If a network was alive,  thought\nScott, it was alive in the sense that a town or village is alive,\nas the sum of its parts.  As a society is alive.  If the computer\nterminal and its operator are members of a global village, as are\nthousands of other computer users, might that not be considered a\nsociety?   Communications are indeed different, but Scott  remem-\nbered that Flatland was considered a valid society with a  unique\nperspective on the universe.  Is it any different than the  tele-\nphone,  which connects everyone on the planet?  Shit, Spook  made\nsome sense.\n\nThey paused on a bridge by the Voorsbugwal, and a few blocks down\nthe  canal Scott saw a concentration of bright  lights.   \"What's\nthat?\" He asked.\n\n\"Poontang,\" the Spook said lasciviously.\n\n\"Say wha?\" Scott asked\n\n\"This  is  Horny Heaven, Ode to Orgasm, Pick a  Perversion.\"  The\nSpook proudly held his arms out.\n\n\"Aha, the Red Light District,\" Scott added dryly.\n\n\"Don't  take the romance out of it, this is sleaze at it's  best.\nBelieve  me I know.\"  Somehow Scott had no doubts.  With the  way\nSpook was passionately describing the specific acts and  services\navailable  within the 10 square block hotbed of sex,  Scott  knew\nthat the Spook was no novice.  They grabbed a couple of Heinekens\nfrom a bar and slowly strolled down one side of the carnal canal.\n\n\"I was going to go to the Yab Yub tonight, but since you've never\nbeen here before, I figured I owed you a tour.\"\n\n\"Yab Yub?  Am I supposed to know . . .\"\n\n\"The biggest bestest baddest whorehouse in Amsterdam,\" said Spook\nexuberantly.\n\n\"O.K., fine, and this is . . .\"\n\n\"The slums.\"\n\n\"Thanks a lot,\" Scott said sarcastically.\n\n\"No,  this  is for middle class tourist sex.  Yab  Yub  is  first\nclass but this'll do me just fine.  How about you? Ready for some\nserious debauching?\" The Spook queried.\n\n\"Huh?\"   Scott laughed anxiously. \"Oh, I don't know,  I've  never\nbeen terribly fond of hookers.\"\n\n\"First time when I was 13.  My uncle took me to a whorehouse  for\nmy  birthday.   Shit,\" the Spook fondly grinned  at  the  memory.\n\"I'll  never forget the look on my mom's face when he  told  her.\nShe lectured him for a week.  Christ,\" he paused. \"It's so funny,\nyou know.  My uncle's gay.\"\n\nScott was enjoying the conversation and the company of the Spook.\nAmericans meeting up with kindred Americans in a foreign land  is\na breath of fresh air and the Spook provided that.\n\nScott  window shopped as they walked, sidestepping the  very  few\nventuresome cars which attempted to penetrate the horny  humanity\non the crowded cobblestone streets.  The variety of sexual  mate-\nrials was beyond comprehension.  Spook seemed to be avidly fluent\nin  their description and application.  In one window,  a  spiked\ndildo  of emmense girth and length dominated the display.   Scott\ngrimaced at the weapon while the Spook commented on it's possible\nuses at an adult sit'n'spin party.\n\n\"Here's  the live sex show,\" the Spook said invitingly.   \"Pretty\nwild.  Look at the pictures.\"  Scott leaned over to view a set of\ngraphic  photographs that would have caused the Meese  Commission\non Pornography to double dose on its Geritol.\n\n\"Damn,  they show this stuff on the street, huh?\" Asked the  sur-\nprised Scott.  He wasn't naive, it was just quite a shock to  see\nsuch  graphic  sexuality in such a concentration and in  such  an\nopen  manner.  On Sundays when the Red Light District  is  closed\nuntil 6 P.M., many Dutch families use the window dressings as the\ntextbook  for their children's' sex education.  \"No,  let's  keep\ngoing,\" Scott said unconvinced he would partake of the pleasures.\n\n\"Isn't  this great?\"  The Spook blurted out as Scott was  looking\nin the window of one of the hundred plus sex shops.  \"I just love\nit.  Remember I was telling you about freedom in Amsterdam?  It's\nkind of like the hacker's ethic.\"\n\nSpook  was going to equate sex and hacking?  \"Is that 'cause  all\nhacker's are hard up?\" Scott laughed.\n\n\"No, dig it.\"  The Spook suddenly stopped to face Scott.   \"Free-\ndom, total freedom implies and requires responsibility.   Without\nthat, the system would collapse into chaotic anarchy.  Hacking is\na  manifestation of freedom.  Once we have cracked a system,  and\nare in it, we have the freedom to do anything we want.  But  that\nfreedom  brings  responsibility too, and, just like with  sex  so\nfreely available, legally, it must be handled with care.\"   Spook\nwas  sermonizing again, but was making more sense. His  parallels\nwere concise and poignant.\n\nThey walked further into the heart of the District and the  Spook\nwas constantly distracted by the quantity of red lights over  the\nbasement  and first floor windows.  He wanted to closely  examine\nthe contents of every one.  In each window was a girl,  sometimes\ntwo, clad in either a dental floss bathing suit or a see  through\npenoire. Scott enjoyed the views, but thought that the Spook  was\nacting  somewhat obsessively. The calm, professional,  knowledge-\nable hacker had reverted into a base creature, driven by hormonal\ncompulsion. Or then again, maybe they were just stoned.\n\n\"I gotta pick the right one, just the right one,\" the Spook said.\n\"Let's  see what else is available.  Got to find you a good  one,\ntoo.\"\n\nScott shook his head.  \"I don't know . . .\"\n\n\"What,  you don't wanna get laid?  What's the matter  with  you?\"\nThe Spook couldn't believe his ears.\n\nThe  sheer intensity of the omnipresent sexual  stimulation  gave\nScott  the  urge to pause and ask himself why.   The  desire  was\nphysically manifest, but the psychology of hookers; it wasn't his\nstyle.   In the three years since he and Maggie had split,  Scott\noccassioned to spend time with many ladies.  He had kept  himself\nin reasonable shape without doing becoming fanatic about it,  and\nhis high metabolism helped keep the body from degenerating  ahead\nof schedule. So he had had his share of companionship and  oppor-\ntunity, but right now he was enjoying the freedom of his work and\nthe pleasures that that offered.  If a woman was in the cards, so\nbe it, but it was not essential at the moment.\n\n\"Nothing, it's just that, well, I prefer to know the lady, if you\nknow what I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, no problem!\" The Spook had an answer.  \"That's an all night-\ner and will cost you 1000 guilders.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Scott said quickly.  \"That's not it.  I just don't  get\na charge from hookers.  Now, if some friends set it up to like  a\nreal pick-up, at the beach, a bar, whatever, as long as I  didn't\nknow.   That  could  prove interesting.  Hmmmm.\"   He  smiled  to\nhimself.  \"But  honestly?   I been a couple of  times,  just  for\ngiggles.  And boy was it giggles.\"\n\nScott  laughed out loud at the memory.  \"The first time it was  a\nfriend's birthday and a bunch of us put up enough to get him laid\nat  the  Chicken  Ranch.\"  That was the evening  Scott  had  lost\nalmost  two  hours of his life on the drive back  to  Vegas.   He\nspeculated  to himself, in private, that he may been abducted  by\nalien creatures from a UFO.  Right.\n\n\"I know the place,\" added the Spook.\n\n\"I  was designated drunk driver so I drove him over to  the  high\ndesert in the company van, about an hour's drive.  Before we went\nin  I insisted on a couple of beers.  He was getting laid  and  I\nwas  nervous.  Go figure.  At any rate, the security cameras  let\nus in and two very attractive ladies in slinky gowns lead us over\nto  the couch.  They immediately assumed that we were both  there\nfor, well, the services.  I was too embarrassed to say no, that I\nwasn't  interested,  but then out came a line of 20 of  the  most\ngorgeous girls you could imagine.  The madam, I forget her  name,\nstepped  in and begged our indulgence for the  interruption.   It\nseems, she said, that the BBC was filming a documentary on broth-\nels,  and they had a camera crew in the next room, and  would  we\nmind too terribly much if they filmed us?\"  Scott feigned extreme\nshock.\n\n\"Filmed  you? For TV?  Even I won't go that far,\" the Spook  said\nimpressed  with  Scott's  story.  \"My movies are  all  first  run\nprivate. Alphabetical from Adelle to Zelda.\"\n\n\"Not  film that, pervert!\" He had pegged the Spook.   \"They  only\nfilmed  the selection process, the initial meetings and then  the\nwalk down the hallways to the bedrooms.\"\n\n\"So what'd you do?\" The Spook asked with interest.\n\n\"We did the camera bit, Jim got laid and I take the fifth.\"\n\n\"You chicken shit asshole,\" hollered the laughing Spook.\n\nScott took that as a compliment from the male slut to whom he was\nspeaking.   \"Listen, that was a long time ago, before I was  mar-\nried, and I don't want it to screw up our divorce. Three years of\nbliss.\"\n\nThe  Spook kept laughing. \"You really are a home boy,  huh?\"   He\ngasped  for air.  They continued down a side street and  back  up\nthe  Oude Zijds Achterburgwal, the other main canal in  the  Dis-\ntrict,  so  Spook could check out more windows.  Those  with  the\ncurtain drawn indicated that either services were being  rendered\nor that it was lunch hour.  Hard to tell.\n\nAs  they  passed the Guys and Gals Sex Shop, the  Spook  abruptly\nstopped  and stepped back toward the canal.  He whistled to  him-\nself  in appreciation of the sex goddesses that had captured  his\nattention.  In the basement window was a stunning buxom brunette,\nwearing an invisible  g-string and bra.  She oozed sexuality with\nher  beckoning  lips  and fingers when she  spotted  the  Spook's\ninterest.  In the first floor window above the brunette were  two\nperfectly  voluptuous  poster blondes,  in  matching  transparent\npeignoirs.  They too, saw the Spook, and attempted to seduce  him\nto  their doorway.  Scott was impressed that the ladies  were  so\nattractive.\n\n\"Some sweet meat, huh?\" Said the Spook ogling his choices.  \"Well\nare you or aren't you?\" He asked with finality. \"I'm all  systems\ngo.   You get first choice: 2 from window A or 1 from  window  B.\nWhat'll it be?\"\n\nScott responded immediately.  \"I got a safer way.  There are five\nbillion  people on the planet, and at any given time at  least  a\nmillion have to be having sex.  So all I have to do is tune  into\nthe Planetary Consciousness, the ultimate archetype, and have  an\norgasm anytime I want.\"\n\n\"You're a sick mother,\" laughed the Spook.  \"Transcendental group\nsex.  At least I can tell the difference between pussy and  pray-\ning.\"  He asked Scott  again to pick a girl.\n\n\"I  have to pass.  It's just not my thing.\"  Spook glared at  him\naskance.   \"No really, go ahead. I'm a bit tired, I just  arrived\nthis morning.\"  He had forgotten to take his 3 hour afternoon nap\nand it was close to 6 in the morning body time.  \"I'll see you at\nthe conference tomorrow.  All right?\"\n\n\"Fuckin' A!\"  The Spook beamed.  \"I get 'em all.\"  He motioned to\nthe girls that he would like to hire all three of them, at  once.\nThey indicated that that would be a fine idea.  \"Listen, I  don't\nmean  to be rude, but . . .\"  the Spook said to Scott as he  pro-\nceeded  up the stairs to meet the female triumvirate.  He  turned\nbriefly in the open doorway with two of the girls tugging at  his\nclothes.  \"Scott!  What happens if the medium or the message gets\nsick?  Think about it.\"  The door closed behind the Spook as  the\ngirls shed their clothes.\n\n\"Medium?  Jeez you are really fucked,\" laughed Scott.  \"Pervert!\"\nHe called out as the window curtains closed.\n\nScott  got directions to the Eureka! from a live sex show  sales-\nman.   For all the walking he and the Spook had done,  miles  and\nmiles,  it was odd that they had ended up only a few blocks  away\nfrom  the hotel.  Ah, but that would figure, thought  Scott.  The\nSex  Starved Spook was staying at the  Europa around  the  corner\nfrom  Sin Street.  Scott rolled a joint of his own to  enjoy  for\nthe  pleasant  evening promenade home along the  canals.   Spook,\nwhat  a character.  In one breath, perfectly rational,  but  then\nthe Jekyll and Hyde hormone hurricane. Wow.\n\nWhat  Scott  Mason could never have imagined,  indeed  quite  the\nopposite,  was that the Spook was unable to respond to the  three\nvery  attentive ladies he had hired for that very purpose.  Noth-\ning.   No  matter what stimuli they effected, the  Spook's  brain\ncould not command his body to respond.  His confusion  alternated\nwith  embarrassment   which made the problem only  worse.   Never\nbefore  had  the Spook had such a problem.  Never.   One  of  the\nladies spoke to him kindly. \"Hey, it happens to everyone once  in\na while.\"  At hearing that he jumped up, removed the loose condom\nand  zipped  his pants while screaming, \"Not to me.   It  doesn't\nhappen to me!\"\n\nScott  did  not know that the Spook bolted into  the  street  and\nstarted  running, in panic, away from the scene of his most  pri-\nvate  of failures.  He ran all the way, in fact beating Scott  to\nhis  hotel.   He  was driven by the terror of  the  first  sexual\nfailure  in his life.  The Spook felt emasculated as he sought  a\nrationalization that would allow him to retain a shred of  digni-\nty.\n\nHe  was used to commanding women, not being humiliated  by  them.\nWhat was wrong?  Women fell all over him, but why this?  This  of\nall things?  The Spook fell asleep on the top of his bed with his\nclothes on.\n\nScott  did not know that he would not be seeing the Spook  tomor-\nrow.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Wednesday, January 6\n     Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Eight  more!\"  exclaimed Charlie Sorenson into Martin  Templer's\nface. \"What the hell is going on?\"  The private office on twenti-\neth and \"L\" Street was well guarded by an efficient  receptionist\nwho believed she worked for an international import export  firm.\nConsulting  offices  were often easier  for  senior  intelligence\nofficials to use for clandestine, unrecorded meetings than  one's\nown office.  In the interest of privacy, naturally.\n\nThe two NSA and CIA agents from \"P\" Street held their clandestine\nmeeting in a plain, windowless office meagerly furnished  with  a\ndesk, a couple of chairs and a file cabinet.\n\nCharlie  turned  his  back on Templer and  sighed.   \"I'm  sorry,\nMarty.   It's not you.\"  He paced to the other side of the  small\nconfining  room.   \"I'm getting pressure from  all  sides.   That\ndamned FBI guy is making a nuisance of himself.  Asking too  many\nquestions.   The  media smells a conspiracy and the  Director  is\ntelling  me to ignore it.\"  Sorenson stood in front  of  Templer.\n\"And, now, no, it's not bad enough, but 8 more of the mothers  go\noff.  Shit!\"  He slammed his fist onto the desk.\n\n\"We  can  explain one to the Pentagon, but  nine?\"  Martin  asked\nskeptically.\n\n\"See what I mean?\" Sorenson pointed.\n\nSorenson and Templer attended the ECCO and CERT roundups twice  a\nweek since they began after the first EMP-T explosion.\n\n\"These  are the Sats?\" Templer leaned over to the desk.   Corners\nof several high resolution satellite photographs sneaked out from\na  partially open folder.  Sorenson opened the folder and  spread\nthe photos across the surface.  They weren't optical photographs,\nbut  the  familiar map shapes of the central United  States  were\nvisible behind swirls and patterns of  a spectrum of colors.  The\ncameras  and  computer had been instructed to  look  at  selected\nbandwidths,  just as infrared vision lets one see at  night.   In\nthis  case, though, the filters excluded everything but  frequen-\ncies of the electromagentic spectrum of interest.\n\n\"Yeah,\"  Sorenson said, pointing at one of the photos.  \"This  is\nwhere  we found the first one.\"  On one of the photos,  where  an\noutline  of the United States was visible, a dot of  fuzzy  light\nwas visible in the Memphis, Tennessee area.\n\n\"That's an EMP-T bomb?\" asked Templer.\n\n\"The electromagnetic signature, in certain bandwidths is the same\nas  from  a nuclear detonation.\"  Sorenson pulled  another  photo\nout.   It was a computer enhanced blowup of the  first  satellite\nphoto.  The bridges across the Mississippi were clearly  visible.\nThe  small  fuzzy dot from the other photograph became  a  larger\nfuzzy cloud of white light.\n\n\"I didn't know we had geosyncs over us, too,\" Templer said light-\nly.\n\n\"Officially  we don't,\" Sorenson said seriously.  Then he  showed\nhis teeth and said, \"unofficially we have them everywhere.\"\n\n\"So who was hit?\"\n\n\"Here?\"  He pointed at Memphis.  \"Federal Express.  A  few  hours\nago.  They're down.  Can't say when they'll be back in  business.\nThank God no one was killed.  They weren't so lucky in Texas.\"\n\nSorenson  pulled  a couple more photographs and a fuzzy  dot  and\nit's  fuzzy cloud mate were clearly visible in the Houston  area.\n\"EDS Computers,\" said Sorenson.  \"Six dead, 15 injured.  They  do\ncentral  processing for hundreds of companies.  Every one,  gone.\nAnd then here.\"   He scattered more photos with the now recogniz-\nable fuzzy white dots.\n\n\"Mid-State  Farm Insurance, Immigration and  Naturalization,  Na-\ntional Bank, General Inter-Dynamics, CitiBank, and the Sears mail\norder  computers.\"   Sorenson spoke excitedly as  he  listed  the\nlatest victims of the magnetic cardiac arrest that their computer\nsystems, and indeed, their entire organization suffered.\n\n\"Press?\"\n\n\"Like stink on shit.\"\n\n\"What do they know?\"\n\n\"Too much.\"\n\n\"What can we do?\"\n\n\"Get to the bottom of this before Mason does.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 19\n\n     Thursday, January 7\n     Amsterdam, Holland\n\nThe following morning Scott awoke without telephone  intervention\nby the front desk. He felt a little on the slow side, an observa-\ntion  he  attributed to either the time difference, not  the  jet\nlag,  or the minor after effect of copius  cannabis  consumption.\nThe  concierge  called a cab and Scott told the driver  where  he\nthought he was going.  Ya, no problem, it's a short ride.\n\nTo  Scott's  surprise he found himself passing by  the  same  sex\nemporium where he had left the Spook last evening. Scott reminded\nhimself  to ask Spook how it went.  The taxi stopped in front  of\nan old building that had no signs of use.  It was number 44,  but\njust in case, Scott asked the driver to wait a moment.  He walked\nup the door and finding no bell, rapped on the heavy wooden door.\n\n\"Ya?\" A muffled voice asked through the door.\n\n\"Is  Jon there? This is Scott Mason.\"  Scott knowingly looked  at\nthe cab driver.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nScott looked at the number again and then remembered what Jon had\ntold  him.   \"Sorry.  This is Repo Man.  Kirk said  you'd  expect\nme.\"\n\n\"Ah, ya! Repo Man.\"  The door opened and Scott happily waved  off\nthe  cab.   \"Welcome, please, come in.\"   Scott  entered  a  dark\nchamber as the door closed behind him.  \"I am Clay, that's French\nfor key.\"\n\nWonderful, thought Scott.  \"Thanks for the invite.  Is Jon here?\"\n\n\"Everyone is here.\"\n\n\"I  thought it didn't begin until eleven,\" Scott said looking  at\nhis watch.\n\n\"Ah,  ya, well,\" the Dutch accented Clay said.  \"It is  difficult\nto stop sometimes.  We have been here all night.\"\n\nScott followed Clay up a darkened flight of steps.  At mid  land-\ning  Clay opened a door and suddenly the dungeon-like  atmosphere\nvanished.   Inside  the cavernous room were perhaps  200  people,\nmostly  men, excitedly conversing and huddling over computers  of\nevery  imaginable model.  The high ceiling was liberally  dressed\nwith  fluorescent  tubing which accentuated the green  hues  from\nmany of the computer monitors.  The walls were raw brick and  the\nsparse decorations were all computer related.  Windows at the two\nends  of the building added enough daylight to take some  of  the\nedge off of the pallid green aura.\n\n\"What  should  I do?\" Asked Scott looking around the  large  room\nwhich was probably overcrowded by modern safety counts.\n\n\"The  Flying Dutchman said he will see you a little later,\"  Clay\nsaid.  \"Many of our members know Repo Man is a reporter, and  you\nare free to look and ask anything. Please enjoy yourself.\"   Clay\nquickly disappeared into the congregation.\n\nScott  suddenly  felt abandoned and wished  he  could  disappear.\nLike those dreams where you find yourself stark naked in a public\nplace.   He felt that his computer naivete was written  all  over\nhis  face  and he would be judged thus, so instead  he  tried  to\nignore it by perusing the walls.  He became amused at the  selec-\ntion of art, poster art, Scotch taped to the brick.\n\nThe first poster had Daffy Duck, or reasonable facsimile thereof,\nprepared  to  bring a high speed sledgehammer in contact  with  a\nkeyboard.   \"Hit  any key to continue,\" was the  simple  poster's\nmessage.   Another  portrayed a cobweb covered  skeleton  sitting\nbehind  a  computer terminal with a repairman standing  over  him\nasking a pertinent question.  \"System been down long?\"\n\nOne of the ruder posters consisted of Ronald Reagan with a super-\nimposed hand making a most obscene manual gesture. The poster was\nentitled, \"Compute This!\"\n\nScott  viewed  the walls as if in an art gallery, not  a  hackers\nconvention.   He  openly laughed when he saw a  poster  from  the\nNational  Computer  Security Center, a working  division  of  the\nNational  Security  Agency.   A red, white and  blue  Uncle  Sam,\nfinger   pointing,  beckoned,  \"We  want  YOU!  to  secure   your\ncomputer.\"    In an open white space on the poster someone  wrote\nin,  \"Please list name and date if you have already cracked  into\nan  NSA  computer.\"  Beneath were a long list of  Hacker  Handles\nwith the dates they had entered the super secret agency's comput-\ners.  Were things really that bad, Scott asked himself.\n\n\"Repo Man?\"\n\nScott  turned quickly to see a large, barrel chested, red  haired\nman  with  an  untamed beard in his early  forties  approach  him\nrapidly.   The man was determined in his gait.   Scott  answered,\n\"Yes . . .?\n\n\"Ya, I'm the Flying Dutchman,\" he said hurriedly in a large boom-\ning  voice.  \"Welcome.\" He vigorously shook Scott's hand  with  a\nwide  smile hidden behind the bushy red face.  \"You  enjoyed  Am-\nsterdam last night, ya?\"  He expected a positive answer.  Sex was\nno crime here.\n\n\"Well,\"  Scott blushed.  \"I must say it was a unique experience,\"\nhe  said  carefully so as  not to offend Holland's  proud  hosts.\n\"But I think the Spook had more fun than I did.\"\n\nThe  Flying  Dutchman's  hand went limp.  \"Spook?   Did  you  say\nSpook?\"  His astonishment was clear.\n\n\"Yeah, why?\"  Scott asked.\n\n\"The Spook?  Here?  No one has seen him in years.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well he's alive and well and screwing his brains out  with\nthree of Amsterdam's finest,\" Scott said with amusement.  \"What's\nthe big deal?\"\n\n\"The  Spook, ya this is goot,\" the Flying Dutchman said  clapping\nhis  hands together with approval.   \"He was the greatest  phreak\nof his day.  He retired years ago, and has only been seen once or\ntwo times maybe.  He is a legend.\"\n\n\"A phreak?\"\n\n\"Oh,  ya, ya.  A phreak,\" he said speaking rapidly. \"Before  home\ncomputers,  in the 1960's and 1970's, hacking meant fighting  the\nphone  company.  In America you call it Ma Bell, I believe.  Cap-\ntain Crunch was the epitome of phone phreaks.\"\n\nThese  names  were a bit much, thought Scott,  but  might  add  a\nsense  of levity to his columns.  \"Captain Crunch?\"  Scott  asked\nwith skepticism.\n\n\"Ya, Captain Crunch.  He blew the plastic whistle from a  Captain\nCrunch  cereal box into the phone,\" the Flying  Dutchman held  an\ninvisible  whistle to his lips. \"And it opened up an inside  line\nto  make long distance calls.  Then he built and sold Blue  Boxes\nwhich recreated the tones to make free calls.\"\n\n\"Phreaking and computer hacking, they're the same?\"\n\n\"Ya,  ya, especially for the older hackers.\" The Flying  Dutchman\npatted  himself on the stomach.  \"You see hacking, some  call  it\ncracking, is taking a system to its limit. Exploring it,  master-\ning the machine.  The phones, computers, viruses, it's all  hack-\ning.  You understand?\"\n\n\"Spook called hacking a technique for investigating new spontane-\nously generated lifeforms.  He said a network was a living being.\nWe  got into quite an argument about it.\"  Scott  sounded  mildly\nderisive of the theory.\n\nThe  Dutchman crossed his arms, grinned wide and rocked back  and\nforth  on  his  heels.  \"Ya, ya.  That  sounds  like  the  Spook.\nCutting to the heart of the issue.  Ya, you see, we all have  our\nreasons why we hack, but ya, Spook is right.  We forget sometimes\nthat the world is one giant computer, with thousands and millions\nof  arms, just like the brain.  The neurons,\" he pointed  at  his\nhead,  \"are connected to each other with synapses.  Just  like  a\ncomputer network.\"\n\nThe Flying Dutchman's explanation was a little less ethereal than\nthe Spook's and Scott found himself anticipating further enlight-\nenment.\n\n\"The  neuron is a computer.  It can function  independently,  but\nbecause  it's capacity is tiny, a neuron is really quite  limited\nin  what it can achieve alone.  The synapse is like  the  network\nwire,  or phone company wiring.  It connects the neurons or  com-\nputers  together.\"  The Dutchman spoke almost religiously  as  he\nanimatedly  drew wires and computers in the air to reinforce  the\nconcept. \"Have you heard of neural networks?\"\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Scott said.  \"The smart chips that can learn.\"\n\n\"Ya, exactly.  A neural network is modeled after the brain,  too.\nIt is a very large number of cells, just like the brain's  cells,\nthat  are  only connected to each other in the  most  rudimentary\nway.\"\n\n\"Like a baby's brain?\" Scott offered.\n\n\"Ya,  ya,  just like a baby.  Very good.  So like the  baby,  the\nneural net grows connections as it learns.  The more  connections\nit makes, the smarter it gets.\"\n\n\"Both the baby and the network?\"\n\n\"Ya,\"  Dutchman laughed.  \"So as the millions of  neural  connec-\ntions  are made, some people learn skills that others  don't  and\nsome  computers are better suited to certain tasks  than  others.\nAnd  now there's a global neural network growing.  Millions  more\ncomputers  are  added  and we connect them  together,  until  any\ncomputer  can talk to any other computer.  Ya, the Spook is  very\nmuch right.  The Network is alive, and it is still learning.\"\n\nScott  was  entering a world where the machines,  the  computers,\nwere personified, indeed imbued with a life of their own by their\ncreators  and  their programmers.  A highly complex  world  where\ninter-relatedness  is infinitely more important than the specific\nfunction.  Connections are issue.  Didn't Spook remind  him  that\nthe medium is the message?\n\nBut where, questioned Scott, is the line between man and machine?\nIf  computers are stupid, and man must program them to give  them\nthe appearance of intelligence, then the same must be true of the\nNetwork, the global information network.  Therefore, when a piece\nof  the  Network is programmed to learn how to  plan  for  future\nNetwork  expansion  and that piece of the Network  calls  another\ncomputer on the Network to inquire as to how it is answering  the\nsame  problem  for different conditions, don't  man  and  machine\nmerge?   Isn't  the Network acting as an extension of  man?   But\nthen,  a  hammer is a tool as well, and no one calls a  hammer  a\nliving being.\n\nUnto  itself it is not alive, Scott reasoned. The Network  merely\nemulates the growth patterns and behavior of the cranial  highway\nsystem.   He was ready to concede that a network was  more  alive\nthan a hammer, but he could not bring himself to carry the analo-\ngy any further yet.\n\n\"That gives me a lot to think about,\" Scott assured the Dutchman.\n\n\"Ya, ya, it does.  Do you understand quantum physics?\"\n\nWhat  the hell would make him ask that question,  thought  Scott.\n\"I  barely passed Quantum 101, the math was too far out  for  me,\nbut,  yes,\" he laughed kindly, \"I do remember the  basics.   Very\nbasic.\"\n\n\"Goot.   In the global Network there is no way to  predict  where\nthe  next information packet will be sent.  Will it start  here,\"\nthe Dutchman motioned to his far left, \"or here?  There's no  way\nto know.  All we can say, just as in physics, is that there is  a\nprobability  of  data being transferred between any  two  points.\nChance.  And we can also view the Network in operation as both  a\nwave and a particle.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" stopped Scott.  \"You've just gone over my head, but I get\nthe point, I think.  You and your associates really believe  that\nthis  global  Network  is an entity unto itself and  that  it  is\ngrowing and evolving on its own as we speak?\"\n\n\"Ya,  exactly.   You see, no one person is  responsible  for  the\nNetwork, its growth or its care.  Like the brain, many  different\nregions control their own piece of the Network.  And, the Network\ncan still function normally even if pieces of it are  disconnect-\ned. The split brain studies.\"\n\n\"And you're the caretakers for the Network?\" doubted Scott.\n\n\"No.  As I said we all have our reasons.  The common  denominator\nis  that we treat the Network as an incredibly powerful  organism\nabout which we know very, very little.  That is our function - to\nlearn.\"\n\n\"What is it that you do?  For a living?\"\n\n\"Ah,  ya.  I am Professor of Technological Sociology at the  Uni-\nversity of Amsterdam. The original proposal for my research  came\nfrom personal beliefs and concerns; about the way the human  race\nhas to learn to cope in the face of great technology leaps.  NATO\nis funding the research.\"\n\n\"NATO,\" exclaimed Scott.  \"They fund hacking?\"\n\n\"No,\" laughed the Dutchman. \"They know that hacking is  necessary\nto gather the raw data my research requires, so they pretend  not\nto notice or care.  What we are trying to do is predict what  the\nBaby,  the  global Network will look and act like when  it  grows\nup.\"\n\n\"Isn't crystal ball gazing easier?\"\n\n\"Ya,  it  may be,\" the Dutchman agreed. \"But now, why  don't you\nlook around?  I am sure you will find it most educational.\"\n\nThe  Dutchman asked again about the Spook. \"Is he really here  in\nAmsterdam?\"   Yup! \"And he said he'd be here today?\"  Yup!   \"The\nSpook, at the conference? He hasn't made an appearance in years.\"\nWell, that's what he told me, he'd be here.\n\nScott  profusely  thanked his host and assured him that  yes,  he\nwould  ask  for anything he needed.  Thank you.   Kirk  had  been\nvindicated,  thought  Scott who had expected a  group  of  pimply\nfaced  adolescents  with nerd shirts to be bouncing  around  like\nSpring Break in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nScott  slowly  explored the tables loaded with various  types  of\ncomputer  gear.  IBM clones were the most common, but an  assort-\nment  of  older  machines, a CP/M or two, even  a  Commodore  PET\nproved  that expensive new equipment was not needed to  become  a\nrespected hacker.  Scott reminded himself that this group was the\nelite of hackerdom.  These were the Hacker's Hackers.\n\nIn his discussions with Kirk, Scott figured he would see some  of\nthe  tools  of  the trade.  But he had no idea of  the  level  of\nsophistication  that  was openly, and perhaps,  illegally,  being\ndemonstrated.   Then  again,  maybe that's why  they  hold  their\nHacker Ho Downs in Amsterdam.\n\nScott learned something very critical early on.\n\n\"Once you let one of us inside your computer, it's all over.  The\nsystem is ours.\"   The universal claim by hackers.\n\n Scott no longer had any trouble accepting that.  \"So the securi-\nty  guy's  job,\" one short balding middle  aged  American  hacker\nsaid,  \"is to keep us out.  I'm a cracker.\"  What's  that?   \"The\ncracker  is kind of like a safecracker, or lock picker.  It's  my\njob to figure out how to get into the computers.\"   Scott had  to\nstifle  a giggle when he found out that this slight man's  handle\nwas appropriately Waldo.\n\nWaldo went on to explain that he was a henpecked CPA who needed a\nhobby that would bore his wife to tears.  So he locked himself in\nthe basement, far away from her, and got hooked on computers.  He\nfound  that  rummaging  through other computers  was  an  amusing\nalternative  to  watching  Honeymooner  reruns  while  his   wife\nkvetched.   After  a while, he said he discovered that he  had  a\ntalent for cracking through the front doors of computers.  On the\nprofessional hacker circuit that made Waldo a valuable commodity.\nThe  way it works, he explained, was that he would  trade  access\ncodes  for  outlines  of the contents of the  computers.   If  he\nwanted to look further, he maintained a complete indexing  system\non the contents of thousands of computers world wide.  He  admit-\nted  it was the only exciting part of his life.  \"The most fun  a\nCPA  has,\" he said calmly, \"is cutting up client's credit  cards.\nBut  me,\"  he  added proudly, \"I've been in and out  of  the  IRS\ncomputers more times than Debbie did it in Dallas.\"\n\n\"The IRS computers? You've been in there?\"\n\n\"Where else does a CPA go, but to the scene of the crime.\"  Waldo\nlaughed  at  his joke.  \"At first it was a game, but once  I  got\ninto the IRS backplane, which connects the various IRS  districts\ntogether,  the  things I found scared me.  No one is  in  control\nover  there.   No one.  They abuse  taxpayers,  basically  honest\ntaxpayers who are genuinely in trouble and need some  understand-\ning by their government. Instead they are on the receiving end of\na  vicious attack by a low level government paper slave who  gets\nhis  thrills  by seizing property.  The IRS is  immune  from  due\nprocess.\"  Scott immediately thought of Tyrone and his  constitu-\ntional ravings the other night.\n\n\"The  IRS's motto is, 'guilty until we cash the check'.  And  IRS\nmanagement  ignores  it.  Auditors are on a quota basis,  and  if\nthey don't recover their allotted amounts of back taxes, they can\nkiss  their jobs goodbye.\"  The innocent looking Waldo, too,  had\nfound  a cause, a raison d'\u001b\b\ntre, for hacking away  at  government\ncomputers.\n\n\"You know that for a fact?\" Asked Scott.  This alone was a  major\nstory.   Such  a policy was against everything  the  Constitution\nstood  for.  Waldo nodded and claimed to have seen  the  internal\npolicy  memoranda.  Who was in charge?  Essentially, said  Waldo,\nno one.  It was anarchy.\n\n\"They  have the worst security of any agency that should  by  all\nrights  have the best.  It's a crime against  American  citizens.\nOur  rights and our privacy have shriveled to  nothing.\"   Waldo,\nthe  small CPA, extolled the virtues of fighting the system  from\nwithin.   From  within  he could battle the  computers  that  had\nbecome the system.\n\n\"Have you ever, shall I say, fixed files in the IRS computers?\"\n\n\"Many times,\" Waldo said proudly.  \"For my clients who were being\nscrewed,  sometimes  I am asked to help.  It's all  part  of  the\njob,\" he said of his beloved avocation.\n\n\"How  many  systems have you cracked?\" Asked Scott,  visibly  im-\npressed.\n\n\"I  am,\"  Waldo said modestly, \"the best.  I  have  cracked  1187\nsystems  in 3 years. 1040 was my personal goal for a while,  then\n1099, but it's kind of open ended now.\"\n\n\"That's almost one a day?\"\n\n\"You  could look at it like that, but sometimes you can get  into\n10  or twenty in one day.  You gotta remember,\" Waldo  said  with\npride, \"a lot of homework goes into this.  You just don't  decide\none day to crack a system.  You have to plan it.\"\n\n\"So how do you do it?\"\n\n\"O.K., it's really pretty simple. D'you speak software?\"\n\n\"Listen, you make it real simple, and I won't interrupt. OK?\"\n\n\"Interrupt. Hah! That's a good one.  Here, let me show you on the\ncomputer,\" Waldo said as he leaned over to peck at the  keyboard.\n\"The  first step to getting into computers is to find where  they\nare  located, electronically speaking, O.K.?\"  Scott agreed  that\nyou needed the address of the bank before you could rob it.\n\n\"So what we do is search for computers by running a program, like\nan exchange autodialer.  Here, look here,\" Waldo said pointing at\nthe  computer screen.  \"We select the area code here,  let's  say\n203,  that's  Connecticut.  Then we pick the  prefix,  the  first\nthree  numbers, that's the local exchange. So let's choose  968,\"\nhe entered the numbers carefully. \"That's Stamford.  By the  way,\nI wrote this software myself.\"  Waldo spoke of his software as  a\nproud  father would of his first born son.  Scott patted  him  on\nthe back, urging him to continue.\n\n\"So we ask the computer to call every number in the 203-968  area\nsequentially.   When the number is answered, my computer  records\nwhether  a voice, a live person answered, or a computer  answered\nor  if  it  was a fax machine.\"  Scott never  had  imagined  that\nhacking was so systematic.\n\n\"Then,  the computer records its findings and we have a  complete\nlist of every  computer in that area,\" Waldo concluded.\n\n\"That's  10,000  phone calls,\" Scott realized.  \"It must  cost  a\nfortune and take forever?\"\n\n\"Nah,  not a dime. The phone company has a hole.    It  takes  my\nprogram  less than a second to record the response and we're  off\nto  the  next  call.   It's all free,  courtesy  of  TPC,\"  Waldo\nbragged.\n\n\"TPC?\" Questioned Scott.\n\n\"The Phone Company,\" Waldo chuckled.\n\n\"I  don't see how you can do the entire country that way,  10,000\ncalls at a shot.  In New York there must be ten million phones.\"\n\n\"Yes,\"  agreed Waldo, \"it is a never ending job.   Phone  numbers\nchange,  computers  come and go, security gets better.   But  you\nhave to remember, there are a lot of other people out there doing\nthe  same thing, and we all pool our information.  You could  ask\nfor  the number to almost any computer in the world, and  someone\nin  our  group, somewhere, will have the number  and  likely  the\npasswords.\"\n\n\"Jesus . . .\"\n\n\"I run my program at night, every night, when I sleep.  On a good\nnight,  if  the  calls are connected quickly  enough,  I  can  go\nthrough about a thousand phone numbers.  I figure roughly a month\nper prefix.\"\n\n\"I am amazed, simply amazed. Truly impressed,\" said Scott.   \"You\nknow,  you always kind of imagine these things are possible,  but\nuntil it stares you in the face it's black magic.\"\n\n\"You  wanna  know the best part?\" Waldo said teasingly.   \"I  get\npaid for it, too.\"  Waldo crouched over and spoke to Scott secre-\ntively.   \"Not everyone here approves, but, I sell lists to  junk\nfax mail-order houses.  They want the fax lists.  On a good night\nI can clear a couple hundred while my modem does the dialing.\"\n\nThe underground culture of Scott's day, demonstrating against the\nwar, getting gassed while marching by George Washington Universi-\nty, getting thrown out of a Nixon rally at  Madison Square Garden\nseemed so innocent in comparison.    He continued to be in awe of\nthe  possible applications for a technology not as benign as  its\ncreators had intended.\n\nScott  met other hackers; they were proud of the term  even  with\nthe current negative connotations it carried.  He saw how system-\nic  attacks against the front door to computers were  the  single\nbiggest  challenge  to hackers; the proverbial chase  before  the\ncatch, the romance to many.\n\nAt another tabletop laden with computers Scott learned that there\nare  programs  designed  to try passwords  according  to  certain\nrules.   Some try every possible combination of letters and  num-\nbers,  although  that is considered an antique  method  of  brute\nforce.  More sophisticated hackers use advanced algorithms  which\ntry to open the computer with 'likely' passwords. <MI>\u000fIt was all\nvery scientific, the approach to the problem<D>, thought Scott.\n\nHe  met  communications gurus who knew more about  the  switching\nnetworks inside the phone company than AT&T engineers.  They  had\ncomplete diagrams and function calls and source code for even the\nlatest software revisions on the 4ESS and the new 5ESS  switches.\n\"Once  you're  into the phone computers,\" one  phone  phreak  ex-\ntolled, \"you have an immense amount of power at your  fingertips.\nIncredible.  Let me give you an example.\"\n\nThe  speaker  was  another American, one that  Scott  would  have\nclassified  as  an ex-Berkeley-hippie still living in  the  past.\nHis  dirty shoulder length hair capped a skinny frame which  held\nhis  jeans up so poorly that there was no question where the  sun\ndidn't shine.\n\n\"You  know  that  the phone company is part  of  the  Tri-Lateral\nCommission,  working with Kissinger and the Queen of  England  to\ncontrol  the world.  Right?\"  His frazzled speech was matched  by\nan annoying habit of sweeping his stringy hair off his face every\nfew words.  \"It's up to us to stop them.\"\n\nScott  listened politely as Janis, (who adopted the moniker  from\nhis  favorite singer) rewrote history with tortured  explanations\nof  how  the  phone company is the hidden seat  of  the  American\ngovernment,  and how they have been lying to the public for  dec-\nades.  And the Rockefellers are involved too, he assured Scott.\n\n\"They  could declare martial law, today, and take over the  coun-\ntry.  Those who control the communications control the power,\" he\noracled.   \"Did  you know,\" he took Scott  into  his  confidence,\n\"that  phones  are always on and they  have  computers  recording\neverything  you  say and do in your own home.   That's  illegal!\"\nJanis bellowed.  Not to mention crazy, thought Scott.\n\nOne of Janis' associates came over to rescue Scott.  \"Sorry, he's\na  little enthusiastic and has some trouble communicating on  the\nEarthly plane.\"   Alva, as he called himself, explained coherent-\nly  that with some of the newer security systems in place, it  is\nnecessary  to  manipulate  the phone company  switches  to  learn\nsystem passwords.\n\n\"For  example, when we broke into a Bell computer that  used  CI-\nCIMS, it was tough to crack.  But now they've added new  security\nthat, in itself, is flawless, albeit crackable,\"  Alva explained.\n\"Once  you get past the passwords, which is trivial,  the  system\nasks you three unique questions about yourself for final  identi-\nfication.   Pretty smart, huh?\"  Scott agreed with Alva, a  voice\nof  apparent moderation.  \"However, we were already in the  phone\nswitch computer, so we programmed in forwarding instructions  for\nall  calls that dialed that particular computer.  We then  inter-\ncepted  the call and connected it to our computer, where we  emu-\nlate  the security system, and watched the questions and  answers\ngo back and forth.  After a few hours, you have a hundred differ-\nent  passwords to use. There are a dozen other ways to do it,  of\ncourse.\"\n\n\"Of  course,\" Scott said sarcastically.  Is nothing sacred?   Not\nin this world it's not.  All's fair in love, war and hacking.\n\nThe time flew as Scott learned what a tightly knitted clique  the\nhackers were.  The ethos 'honor among thieves' held true here  as\nit  did in many adolescent societies, most recently the  American\nOld  West.   As  a group, perhaps even a  subculture,  they  were\narduously  taming new territory, each with their own vision of  a\nprivate  digital  homestead.  Each one taking on  the  system  in\ntheir  own  way, they still needed each other, thus  they  looked\naside  if  another's techno-social behavior was  personally  dis-\ntasteful.  The  Network was big enough for everyone.   A  working\nanarchy  that heralded the standard of John Paul Jones  as  their\nsole commandment: Don't Tread On Me.\n\nHe saw tapping devices that allowed the interception of  computer\ndata which traveled over phone lines.  Line Monitors and Sniffers\nwere commercially available, and legal; equipment that was  nomi-\nnally designed to troubleshoot networks. In the hands of a  hack-\ner,  though,  it  graduated from being a  tool of  repair  to  an\noffensive weapon.\n\nSmall  hand held radios were capable of listening in to  the  in-\ncreasingly popular remote RF networks which do not require wires.\nCellular phone eavesdropping devices permitted the owner to  scan\nand focus on the conversation of his choice.  Scott examined  the\nelectronic gear to find a manufacturer's identification.\n\n\"Don't  bother,  my friend,\" said a long haired German  youth  of\nabout twenty.\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"I see you are looking for marks, yes?\"\n\n\"Well, yes.  I wanted to see who made these . . .\"\n\n\"I  make them, he makes them, we all make them,\" he  said  almost\ngiddily.   \"This is not available from Radio Shack,\" he  giggled.\n\"Who  needs them from the establishment when they are so easy  to\nbuild.\"\n\nScott  knew  that electronics was indeed a garage  operation  and\nthat  many  high  tech initiatives had  begun  in  entrepreneur's\nbasements.   The  thought of home  hobbyists  building  equipment\nwhich  the  military defends against was anathema to  Scott.   He\nmerely  shook his head and moved on, thanking the makers  of  the\neavesdropping machines for their demonstrations.\n\nOver  in a dimly lit corner, dimmer than elsewhere, Scott  saw  a\nnumber  of people fiddling with an array of computers and  equip-\nment  that  looked surprisingly familiar.  As  he  approached  he\nexperienced  an  immediate rush of d\u001b\u0002\nja vu.   This was  the  same\ntype of equipment that he had seen on the van before it was blown\nup a couple of months ago. Tempest busting, he thought.\n\nThe group was speaking in German, but they were more than glad to\nswitch to English for Scott's benefit.  They sensed his  interest\nas  he poked around the assorted monitors and antennas  and  test\nequipment.\n\n\"Ah,  you  are interested in Van Eck?\" asked one  of  the  German\nhackers.   They  maintained a clean cut appearance,  and  through\ndiscussion   Scott  learned that they were funded as  part  of  a\nuniversity research project in Frankfurt.\n\nScott watched and listened as they set up a compelling demonstra-\ntion.   First,  one computer screen displayed a  complex  graphic\npicture.   Several yards away another computer displayed a  foggy\nimage  that cleared as one of the students adjusted  the  antenna\nattached to the computer.\n\n\"Aha! Lock!\" one of them said, announcing that the second comput-\ner would now display everything that the first computer did.  The\ngroup played with color and black and white graphics, word  proc-\nessing  screens  and  spreadsheets.  Each time, in  a  matter  of\nseconds, they 'locked' into the other computer successfully.\n\nScott  was  duly impressed and asked them why they  were  putting\neffort into such research.  \"Very simple,\" the apparent leader of\nthe Frankfurt group said.  \"This work is classified in both  your\ncountry  and  mine, so we do not have access to  the  answers  we\nneed.  So, we build our own and now it's no more classified.  You\nsee?\"\n\n\"Why do you need it?\"\n\n\"To  protect against it,\" they said in near unison.    \"The  next\nstep is to build efficient methods to fight the Van Eck.\"\n\n\"Doesn't Tempest do that?\"\n\n\"Tempest?\"  the senior student said.  \"Ha! It makes the  computer\nweigh a thousand pounds and the monitor hard to read.  There  are\nbetter  ways  to  defend.  To defend we must first  know  how  to\nattack. That's basic.\"\n\n\"Let  me ask you something,\" Scott said to the group after  their\nlengthy  demonstration.  \"Do you know anything about  electromag-\nnetic pulses?  Strong ones?\"\n\n\"Ya.  You mean like from a nuclear bomb?\"\n\n\"Yes, but smaller and designed to only hurt computers.\"\n\n\"Oh,  ya.   We  have wanted to build one, but it  is  beyond  our\nmeans.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Scott said smugly, \"someone is building them and  setting\nthem off.\"\n\n\"Your  stock exchange.  We thought that the  American  government\ndid it to prove they could.\"\n\nAn  hour of ensuing discussion taught Scott that  the  technology\nthat  the DoD and the NSA so desperately spent billions  to  keep\nsecret and proprietary was in common use.  To most engineers, and\nScott  could  easily relate, every problem has  an  answer.   The\nchallenge  is to accomplish the so-called impossible.  The  engi-\nneer's pride.\n\nJon,  the  Flying Dutchman finally rescued Scott's  stomach  from\nimplosion.   \"How  about lunch?  A few of the guys want  to  meet\nyou.  Give you a heavy dose of propaganda,\" he threatened.\n\n\"Thank  God! I'm famished and haven't touched the stuff all  day.\nLove to,  it's on me,\" Scott offered.  He could see Doug having a\ncow.  How could he explain a thousand dollar dinner for a hundred\nhungry hackers?\n\n\"Say that too loud,\" cautioned the bearded Dutchman, \"and  you'll\nhave  to buy the restaurant.  Hacking isn't very high on the  pay\nscale.\"\n\n\"Be easy on me, I gotta justify lunch for an army to my boss,  or\nworse  yet, the beancounters.\"  Dutchman didn't catch the  idiom.\n\"Never mind, let's keep it to a small regiment, all right?\"\n\nHe  never figured out how it landed on his shoulders,  but  Scott\nended  up  with the responsibility of picking  a  restaurant  and\nsuccessfully  guiding the group there. And Dutchman  had  skipped\nout without notifying anyone.  Damned awkward, thought Scott.  He\nassumed control, limited though it was, and led them to the  only\nrestaurant he knew, the Sarang Mas.  The group blindly and happi-\nly  followed.   They even let him order the food, so he  did  his\nvery  best  to impress them by ordering without  looking  at  the\nmenu.   He succeeded, with his savant phonetic memory,  to  order\nexactly  what he had the night prior, but this time he asked  for\nvastly greater portions.\n\nAs  they  were  sating their pallets, and commenting  on  what  a\nwonderful  choice  this  restaurant was, Scott  popped  the  same\nquestion  to  which he had previously been unable  to  receive  a\nconcise  answer.  Now that he had met this bunch,  he  would  ask\nagain,  and if lucky, someone might respond and actually be  com-\nprehensible.\n\n\"I've  been asking the same question since I got into this  whole\nhacking  business,\" Scott said savoring goat parts  and  sounding\nquite nonchalant. \"And I've never gotten a straight answer.   Why\ndo  you hack?\" He asked. \"Other than the philosophical  credo  of\nNetwork is Life, why do you hack?\"  Scott looked into their eyes.\n\"Or are you just plain nosy?\"\n\n\"I bloody well am!\" said the one called Pinball who spoke with  a\nthick  Liverpudlian  accent.  His jeans were in  tatters,  in  no\nbetter  shape  than his sneakers.  The short pudgy man  was  mid-\ntwenty-ish and his tall crewcut was in immediate need of  reshap-\ning.\n\n\"Nosy?  That's why you hack?\" Asked Scott in disbelief.\n\n\"Yeah,  that's  it,  mate. It's great fun.  A game  the  size  of\nlife.\"   Pinball  looked at Scott as if to say,  that's  it.   No\nhidden  meaning, it's just fun.  He swallowed more of the  exqui-\nsite food.\n\n\"Sounds  like whoever dies with the most hacks wins,\" Scott  said\nfacetiously.\n\n\"Right. You got it, mate.\" Pinball never looked up from his  food\nwhile talking.\n\nScott scanned his luncheon companions for reaction.  A couple  of\ngrunts, no objection.  What an odd assortment, Scott thought.  At\nleast  the  Flying Dutchman had been kind enough to  assemble  an\nEnglish speaking group for Scott's benefit.\n\n\"We  each  have  our reasons to hack,\" said the  one  who  called\nhimself Che2.  By all appearance Che2 seemed more suited to a BMW\nthan a revolutionary cabal.  He was a well bred American, dressed\ncasually but expensively.  \"We may not agree with each other,  or\nanyone,  but we have an underlying understanding that permits  us\nto cooperate.\"\n\n\"I can tell you why I hack,\" said the sole German  representative\nat the table who spoke impeccable English with a thick accent  \"I\nam  a professional ethicist.  It is people like me who help  gov-\nernments  formulate rules that decide who lives and who  dies  in\nemergency  situations.   The right or wrong of  weapons  of  mass\ndestruction.   Ethics  is a social moving target that  must  con-\nstantly  be  re-examined  as we as a civilized  people  grow  and\nstrive to maintain our innate humanity.\"\n\n\"So  you  equate hacking and ethics, in the same  breath?\"  Scott\nasked.\n\n\"I  certainly  do,\" said the middle aged German hacker  known  as\nSolon. \"I am part of a group that promotes the Hacker Ethic.   It\nis really quite simple, if you would be interested.\"  Scott urged\nhim  to  continue.  \"We have before us, as a world,  a  marvelous\nopportunity,  to  create a set of rules, behavior  and  attitudes\ntowards  this  magnificent technology that  blossoms  before  our\neyes.   That law is the Ethic, some call it the Code.\"  Kirk  had\ncalled it the Code, too.\n\n\"The Code is quite a crock,\" interrupted a tall slender man  with\ndisheveled  white  hair who spoke with an upper  crust,  ever  so\nproper   British accent.  \"Unless everybody follows it, from A to\nZed,  it simply won't work.  There can be no exceptions.   Other-\nwise my friends, we will find ourselves in a technological   Lord\nof the Flies.\"\n\n\"Ah, but that is already happening,\" said a gentleman in his mid-\nfifties,  who also sported a full beard, bushy mustache and  long\nwell kept salt and pepper hair to his shoulders.  \"We are already\nwell on the road to a date with Silicon Armageddon.  We didn't do\nit  with the Bomb, but it looks like we're sure as hell gonna  do\nit  with  technology for the masses.  In  this  case  computers.\"\nGoing only by 'Dave', he was a Philosophy Professor at  Stanford.\nIn  many ways he spoke like the early Timothy Leary, using  tech-\nnology  instead of drugs as a mental catalyst.  Scott  though  of\nDave as the futurist in the group.\n\n\"He's  right. It is happening, right now.  Long Live the  Revolu-\ntion,\" shouted Che2.  \"Hacking keeps our personal freedoms alive.\nI know I'd much prefer everyone knowing my most intimate  secrets\nthan have the government and TRW and the FBI and the CIA  control\nit and use only pieces of it for their greed-sucking reasons.  No\nway.   I want everyone to have the tools to get into the  Govern-\nment's Big Brother computer system and make the changes they  see\nfit.\"\n\nScott  listened as his one comment spawned a heated and  animated\ndiscussion.   He  wouldn't  break in unless  they  went  too  far\nafield, wherever that was, or he simply wanted to join in on  the\nconversation.\n\n\"How can you support freedom without responsibility?  You contra-\ndict yourself by ignoring the Code.\"  Solon made his comment with\nTeutonic matter of factness in between mouthfuls.\n\n\"It is the most responsible thing we can do,\" retorted Che2.  \"It\nis our moral duty, our responsibility to the world to protect our\nprivacy,  our rights, before they are stripped away as they  have\nbeen since the Republicans bounced in, but not out, over a decade\nago.\"  He turned in his chair and glared at Scott.  Maybe  thirty\nyears  old, Che2 was mostly bald with great bushes of curly  dark\nbrown  hair encircling his head. The lack of hair emphasized  his\nlarge  forehead  which stood over his deeply  inset  eyes.   Che2\ncalled  the  Boston  area his home but  his  cosmopolitan  accent\nbelied his background.\n\nThe proper British man known as Doctor Doctor, DRDR on the BBS's,\nwas  over six foot five with an unruly frock of thick white  hair\nwhich  framed  his ruddy pale face.  \"I do beg your  pardon,  but\nthis  so  violates the tenets of civilized behavior.   What  this\ngentleman  proposes  is the philosophical  antithesis  of  common\nsense  and rationality.  I suggest we consider the position  that\neach of us in actual fact is working for the establishment, if  I\nmay  use  such a politically pass\u001b\u0002\n descriptor.\"   DRDR's  comment\nhushed  the table.  He continued.  \"Is it not true that  security\nis being installed as a result of many of our activities?\"\n\nSeveral nods of agreement preceded a small voice coming from  the\nfar  end  of the table.  \"If you want to call  it  security.\"   A\nsmall pre-adolescent spoke in a high pitched whine.\n\n\"What do you mean . . .I'm sorry, I don't know what to call you,\"\nasked Scott.\n\n\"GWhiz.  The security is a toy.\"\n\nGWhiz spoke unpretentiously about how incredibly simple it is  to\ncrack any security system.  He maintained that there are theoret-\nical methods to crack into any, and he emphasized any,  computer.\n\"It's impossible to protect a computer 100%.  Can't be done.   So\nthat  means  that every computer is crackable.\"   He  offered  to\nexplain  the  math  to Scott who politely  feigned  ignorance  of\ndecimal  points.   \"In   short, I, or anyone, can  get  into  any\ncomputer they want.  There is always a way.\"\n\n\"Isn't  that a scary thought?\" Scott asked to no one in  particu-\nlar.\n\nScott  learned from the others that GWhiz was a 16 year old  high\nschool junior from Phoenix, Arizona.  He measured on the high-end\nof  the genius scale, joined Mensa at 4 and already had  in  hand\nscholarships  from Westinghouse,  Mellon, CalTech, MIT,  Stanford\nto name a few.  At the tender age of 7 he started programming and\nwas now fluent in eleven computer languages.  GWhiz was  regarded\nwith an intellectual awe from hackers for his theoretical  analy-\nses  that  he had turned into hacking tools.  He  was  a  walking\nencyclopedia of methods and techniques to both protect and attack\ncomputers.   To GWhiz, straddling the political fence  by  arming\nboth  sides  with the same weapons was a logical  choice.   Scott\nviewed  it as a high tech MAD - Mutual Assured Destruction,  com-\nputer wise.\n\n\"Don't  you see,\" said the British DRDR, continuing as  if  there\nhad  been  no interruption.  \"The media portrays us  as  security\nbreaking phreaks, and that's exactly what we are.  And that works\nfor the establishment as well.  We keep the designers and securi-\nty people honest by testing their systems for free.  What a great\ndeal,  don't  you think?  We, the hackers of the world,  are  the\nGood Housekeeping Seal of security systems by virtue of the  fact\nthat  either we can or we cannot penetrate them.  If  that's  not\nworking for the system, I don't know what is.\"\n\n\"DRDR's  heading down the right path,\"  Dave the  futurist  spoke\nup.  \"Even though he does work for GCHQ.\"\n\n\"GCHQ?\" Scott asked quickly.\n\n\"The English version of your NSA,\" said Pinball, still  engrossed\nin his food.\n\n\"I do not!\"  protested DRDR.  \"Besides, what difference would  it\nmake if I did?\" He asked more defensively.\n\n\"None,  none  at  all,\" agreed Dave.  \"The effect  is  the  same.\nHowever, if you are an MI-5 or MI-6 or whatever, that would  show\na  great  deal  of unanticipated foresight on the  part  of  your\ngovernment.   I wish ours would think farther ahead than  today's\nheadlines.  I have found that people everywhere in the world  see\nthe problem as one of hackers, rather than the fundamental issues\nthat are at stake.  We hackers are manifestations of the problems\nthat  technology  has bequeathed us.  If any of  our  governments\nwere  actually  responsive enough to listen, they  would  have  a\ngreat  deal  of  concern for  the  emerging  infrastructure  that\ndoesn't  have a leader.  Now, I'm not taking a side on this  one,\nbut  I am saying that if I were the government, I would  sure  as\nall hell want to know what was going on in the trenches. The U.S.\nespecially.\"\n\nEveryone seemed to agree with that.\n\n\"But they're too caught up in their own meaningless self-sustain-\ning parasitic lives to realize that a new world is shaping around\nthem.\"   When Che2 spoke, he spoke his mind, leaving no doubt  as\nto how he felt.  \"They don't have the smarts to get involved  and\nsee  it first hand.  Which is fine by me, because, as you  said,\"\nhe  said  pointing at DRDR, \"it doesn't  matter.   They  wouldn't\nlisten  to  him anyway.  It gives us more time to  build  in  de-\nfenses.\"\n\n\"Defenses against what?\" asked Scott.\n\n\"Against them, of course,\" responded Che2.  \"The fascist military\nindustrial  establishment keeps us under a  microscope.   They're\nscared  of  us.  They have spent tens of billions of  dollars  to\nconstruct  huge computers,  built into the insides of  mountains,\nprotected from nuclear attack. In them are data bases about  you,\nand me, and him and hundreds of millions of others.  There are  a\nlot  of  these systems, IRS, the Census Department has  one,  the\nFBI,  the DIA, the CIA, the NSA, the OBM, I can go  on.\"   Che2's\nvoice crescendo'd and he got more demonstrative as the importance\nhe  attributed to each subject increased.  \"These computers  con-\ntain the most private information about us all.  I for one,  want\nto  prevent them from ever using that information against  me  or\nletting others get at it either.  Unlike those who feel that  the\nBill  of  Rights should be re-interpreted and re-shaped  and  re-\npackaged  to feed their power frenzy, I say it's worked  for  200\nyears and I don't want to fix something if it ain't broke.\"\n\n\"One  needs to weigh the consequences of breaking and entering  a\ncomputer, assay the purpose, evaluate the goal against the possi-\nble negatives before wildly embarking through a foreign computer.\nThat  is  what we mean by the Code.\"  Solon  spoke  English  with\nTeutonic  precision and a mild lilt that gave his accented  words\nadditional credibility.  He sounded like an expert.  \"I  believe,\nquite  strongly,  that it is not so complicated to have  a  major\nportion of the hacker community live by the Code.  Unless you are\nintent on damage, no one should have any trouble with the  simple\nCredo,  'leave  things  as you found them'.  You  see,  there  is\nnothing  wrong  with breaking security as long as  you're  accom-\nplishing something useful.\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" interrupted Scott.  \"Am I hearing this right?   You're\nsaying  that it's all right to break into a computer as  long  as\nyou  don't  do any damage, and put everything  right  before  you\nleave?\"\n\n\"That's  about  it.  It is so simple, yet so  blanketing  in  its\nramifications.  The beauty of the Code, if everyone lived by  it,\nwould  be  a maximization of computer resources.   Now,  that  is\ngood for everyone.\"\n\n\"Wait,  I can't stand this, wait,\" said Scott holding  his  hands\nover  his head in surrender.  He elicited a laugh  from  everyone\nbut Che2.  \"That's like saying, it's O.K. for you to come into my\nhouse when I'm not there, use the house, wash the dishes, do  the\nlaundry,  sweep up and split.  I have a real problem  with  that.\nThat's  an invasion of my privacy and I would  personally  resent\nthe shit out of it.\"  Scott tried this line of reasoning again as\nhe had with Kirk.\n\n\"Just  the point,\" said DRDR.  \"When someone breaks into a  house\nit's a civil case.  But this new bloody Computer Misuse Act makes\nit a felony to enter a computer.  Parliament isn't 100% perfect,\"\nhe added comically.  DRDR referred to the recent British attempts\nat legislative guidelines to criminalize certain computer activi-\nties.\n\n\"As  you  should resent it.\"  Dave jumped in speaking  to  Scott.\n\"But there's a higher purpose here.  You resent your house  being\nused  by  an uninvited guest in your absence. Right?\"   Scott  a-\ngreed.   \"Well,  let's  say that you are going to  Hawaii  for  a\ncouple  of weeks, and someone discovers that your house is  going\nto be robbed while you're gone.  So instead of bothering you,  he\nhouse  sits.   Your house doesn't get robbed,  you  return,  find\nnothing amiss, totally unaware of your visitor.  Would you rather\nget robbed instead?\"\n\n\"Well,  I  certainly don't want to get robbed, but . . .  I  know\nwhat  it  is.  I'm out of control and my privacy is  still  being\nviolated.  I don't know if I have a quick answer.\"  Scott  looked\nand sounded perplexed.\n\n\"Goot!   You should not have a quick answer, for that  answer  is\nthe core, the essence of the ultimate problem that we all  inves-\ntigate every day.\" Solon gestured to their table of seven.  \"That\nquestion is security versus freedom.  Within the world of  acade-\nmia there is a strong tendency to share everything.  Your  ideas,\nyour thoughts, your successes and failures, the germs of an  idea\nthrown away and the migration of a brainstorm into the  tangible.\nThey  therefore desire complete freedom of information  exchange,\nthey  do not wish any restrictions on their freedom to  interact.\nHowever,  the  Governments of the world want to isolate  and  re-\nstrict  access  to information; right or  wrong,  we  acknowledge\ntheir  concern.   That is the other side, security  with  minimal\nfreedom.   The  banks also prefer security to  freedom,  although\nthey  do it very poorly and give it a lot, how do you say, a  lot\nof lip service?\"\n\nEveryone agreed that describing a bank's security as lip  service\nwas entirely too complimentary, but for the sake of brevity  they\nlet it go uncontested.\n\n\"Then again, business hasn't made up  its mind as to whether they\nshould  bother protecting information assets or not.   So,  there\nare  now four groups with different needs and desires which  vary\nthe  ratio of freedom to security.  In reality, of course,  there\nwill  be hundreds of opinions,\" Solon added for accuracy's  sake.\n\"Mathematically,  if there is no security, dividing by 0  results\nin  infinite  freedom.  Any security at all and some  freedom  is\ncurtailed.   So, therein the problem to be solved.  At what  cost\nfreedom?   It is an age old question that every  generation  must\nask,  weigh and decide for itself.  This generation will  do  the\nsame for information and freedom.  They are inseparable.\"\n\nScott  soaked in the words and wanted to think about them  later,\nat  his  leisure.   The erudite positions taken  by  hackers  was\nastonishing  compared to what he had expected.  Yes, some of  the\ngoals  and  convictions were radical to say the  least,  but  the\narguments were persuasive.\n\n\"Let  me ask you,\" Scott said to the group.  \"What  happens  when\ncomputers are secure?  What will you do then?\"\n\n\"They  won't get secure,\" GWhiz said.  \"As soon as they  come  up\nwith a defense, we will find a way around it.\"\n\n\"Won't that cycle ever end?\"\n\n\"Technology  is  in  the hands of the  people,\"  commented  Che2.\n\"This is the first time in history when the power is not  concen-\ntrated  with  a  select few.  The ancients kept  the  secrets  of\nwriting  with their religious leaders;  traveling by ship in  the\nopen  sea was a hard learned and noble skill.  Today, weapons  of\nmass  destruction  are  controlled by a few mad men  who  are  no\nbetter than you or I.  But now, computers, access to information,\nthat power will never be taken away.  Never!\"\n\n\"It  doesn't  matter.\"  Dave was viewing the future  in  his  own\nmind.  \"I doubt that computers will ever be secure, but  instead,\nthe barrier, the wall, the time and energy it takes to crack into\nthem  will  become prohibitive for all but the  most  determined.\nAnyway, there'll be new technology to explore.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" Asked Scott.\n\n\"Satellites are pretty interesting.  They are a natural extension\nof the computer network, and cracking them will be lots easier in\na couple of years.\"  DRDR saw understanding any new technology as\na\u000fpersonal challenge.\n\n\"How do you crack a satellite?  What's there to crack?\"\n\n\"How  about  beaming your own broadcasts to  millions  of  people\nusing  someone  else's satellite?\" DRDR speculated.   \"It's  been\ndone before, and as the equipment gets cheaper, I can assure  you\nthat  we'll  be seeing many more political  statements  illegally\nbeing  made over the public airwaves.  The BBC and NBC will  have\ntheir  hands full.   In the near future, I see virtual  realities\nas an ideal milieu for next generation hackers.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Solon.  \"And with virtual realities, the  ethical\nissues are even more profound than with the Global Network.\"\n\nScott  held  up  his hands.  \"I know what _I_ think  it  is,  but\nbefore you go on, I need to know how you define a virtual  reali-\nty.\"  The hackers looked at each until Dave took the ball.\n\n\"A  virtual reality is fooling the mind and body  into  believing\nsomething  is  real that isn't real.\"  Scott's  face  was  blank.\n\"Ever  been  to Disneyland?\"  Dave asked.   Scott  nodded.   \"And\nyou've ridden Star Tours?\"  Scott nodded again.  \"Well, that's  a\nsimple virtual reality.  Star Tours fools your body into thinking\nthat you are in a space ship careening through an asteroid  belt,\nbut  in  reality,  you are suspended on a few  guy  wires.    The\nprojected image reinforces the sensory hallucination.\"\n\n\"Now  imagine a visual field, currently it's done  with  goggles,\nthat creates real life pictures, in real time and interacts  with\nyour movements.\"\n\nScott's light bulb went off.  \"That's like the Holo-Deck on  Star\nTrek!\"\n\n\"That is the ultimate in virtual reality, yes.  But before we can\nachieve  that, imagine sitting in a virtual cockpit of a  virtual\ncar, and seeing exactly what you would see from a race car at the\nIndy  500. The crowds, the noises, and just as  importantly,  the\nfeel of the car you are driving.  As you drive, you shift and the\ncar  reacts,  you feel the car react.  You  actually  follow  the\ntrack  in  the path that you steer.  The  combination  of  sight,\nsound  and  hearing, even smell, creates a  total  illusion.   In\nshort,  there is no way to distinguish between reality and  delu-\nsion.\"\n\n\"Flight simulators for the people,\" chimed in Che2.\n\n\"I  see  the  day when every Mall in America  will  have  Virtual\nReality  Parlors where you can live out your fantasies.  No  more\nthan 5 years,\" Dave confidently prognosticated.\n\nScott  imagined the Spook's interpretation of virtual  realities.\nHe  immediately conjured up the memory of Woody Allen's  Orgasma-\ntron  in  the movie Sleeper.  The hackers claimed  that  computer\ngenerated sex was less than ten years away.\n\n\"And  that  will be an ideal terrain for hackers.  That  kind  of\npower over the mind can be used for terrible things, and it  will\nbe  up to us to make sure it's not abused.\"  Che2 maintained  his\nposition of guardian of world freedom.\n\nAs  they  finished  their lunch and Scott paid  the  check,  they\nthanked  him vigorously for the treat.  They might be  nuts,  but\nthey were polite, and genuine.\n\n\"I'm  confused  about  one thing,\" Scott said as  they  left  the\nrestaurant  and walked the wide boulevard.  \"You all advocate  an\nindependence,  an anarchy where the individual is paramount,  and\nthe  Government  is worse than a necessary evil.   Yet  I  detect\ndisorganization, no plan; more like a leaf in a lake, not knowing\nwhere  it  will go next.\"  There were no disagreements  with  his\nsummary assessment.\n\n\"Don't  any of you work together?  As a group, a kind of a  gang?\nIt  seems to me that if there was an agenda, a program, that  you\nmight achieve your aims more quickly.\"  Scott was trying to avoid\nbeing critical by his inquisitiveness.\n\n\"Then we would be a government, too, and that's not what we want.\nThis  is about individual power, responsibility.  At any rate,  I\ndon't  think  you  could find two of us in  enough  agreement  on\nanything  to   build a platform.\"  As usual, Solon  maintained  a\npragmatic approach.\n\n\"Well,\" Scott mused out loud. \"What would happen if a group, like\nyou,  got  together and followed a game plan.  Built  a  hacker's\nguide  book  and  stuck to it, all for a common  cause,  which  I\nrealize  is  impossible.   But for argument's  sake,  what  would\nhappen?\"\n\n\"That would be immense power,\" said Che2.  \"If there were enough,\nthey could do pretty much what they wanted.  Very political.\"\n\n\"I  would see it as dangerous, potentially very dangerous,\"  com-\nmented DRDR.  He pondered the question.  \"The effects of  synergy\nin  any endeavor are unpredictable.  If they worked as  group,  a\nunit,  it is possible that they would be a force to  be  reckoned\nwith.\"\n\n\"There  would be only one word for it,\" Dave said with  finality.\n\"They  could easily become a strong and deadly opponent if  their\naims are not benevolent.  Personally, I would have to call such a\ngroup, terrorists.\"\n\n\"Sounds like the Freedom League,\" Pinball said off handedly.\n\nScott's  head  jerked toward Pinball.  \"What  about  the  Freedom\nLeague?\" he asked pointedly.\n\n\"All I said is that this political hacking sounds like the  Free-\ndom  League,\"  Pinball said innocently.  \"They bloody well go  on\nfor  a fortnight and a day about how software should be  free  to\nanyone  that  needs it, and that only those that  can  afford  it\nshould pay.  Like big corporations.\"\n\n\"I've heard of Freedom before,\" piped Scott.\n\n\"The  Freedom League is a huge BBS, mate.  They have hundreds  of\nlocal BBS's around the States, and even a few across the pond  in\nGod's country.  Quite an operation, if I say.\"\n\nPinball  had  Scott's full attention.  \"They run the  BBS's,  and\nhave an incredible shareware library.  Thousands of programs, and\nthey give them all away.\"\n\n\"It's very impressive,\" Dave said giving credit where credit  was\ndue.   \"They  prove that software can  be  socially  responsible.\nWe've been saying that for years.\"\n\n\"What  does anybody know about this Freedom League?\" Scott  asked\nsuspiciously.\n\n\"What's  to  know?  They've been around for years, have  a  great\nservice, fabulous BBS's, and reliable software.\"\n\n\"It  just sounds too good to be true,\"  Scott mused as they  made\nit back to the warehouse for more hours of education.\n\n* * * * *\n\nUntil  late that night, Scott continued to elicit viewpoints  and\nopinions  and  political positions from the  radical  underground\nelements of the 1990's he had traveled 3000 miles to meet.   Each\nencounter, each discussion, each conversation yielded yet another\nperspective  on the social rational for hacking and the  invasion\nof privacy.    Most everyone at the InterGalactic Hackers Confer-\nence  had heard about Scott, the Repo Man,  and knew why  he  was\nthere.   He was accepted as a fair and impartial  observer,  thus\nmany  of them made a concerted effort to preach their  particular\ncase to him. By midnight, overload had consumed Scott and he made\na polite exit, promising to return the following day.\n\nStill, no one had heard from or seen the Spook.\n\nScott walked back to his hotel through the Red Light District and\nstopped to purchase a souvenir or two.  The sexually explicit  T-\nShirts  would have both made Larry Flynt blush and be  banned  on\nFlorida beaches, but the counterfeit $1 bills, with George  Wash-\nington  and the pyramid replaced by closeups of  impossible  oral\nsexual acts was a compelling gift.  They were so well made,  that\nwithout  a close inspection, the pornographic money could  easily\nfind itself in the till at a church bake sale.\n\nThere  was  a message waiting for Scott when he  arrived  at  the\nEureka!    It was from Tyrone and marked urgent.  New York was  6\nhours  behind,  so hopefully Ty was at home.   Scott  dialed  USA\nConnect,  the  service that allows travelers to get  to  an  AT&T\noperator rather than fight the local phone system.\n\n\"Make it good.\"  Tyrone answered his home phone.\n\n\"Hey, guy.  You rang?\"  Scott said cheerily.\n\n\"Shit,  it's about time.  Where the hell have you been?\"   Tyrone\nwhispered  as  loud as he could.  It was obvious he  didn't  want\nanyone  on  his end hearing.  \"You can thank your  secretary  for\ntelling me where you were staying.\"  Tyrone spoke quickly.\n\n\"I'll give her a raise,\" lied Scott. He didn't have a  secretary.\nThe paper used a pool for all the reporters.  \"What's the panic?\"\n\n\"Then  you  don't know.\"  Tyrone caught himself. \"Of  course  you\ndidn't hear, how could you?\"\n\n\"How could I hear what?\"\n\n\"The shit has done hit the fan,\" Tyrone said drawling his  words.\n\"Two  more  EMP-T bombs.  The Atlanta regional IRS office  and  a\npayroll  service in New Jersey.  A quarter million  folks  aren't\ngetting paid tomorrow.  And I'll tell you, these folks is  mighty\npissed off.\"\n\n\"Christ,\" Scott said, mentally chastising himself for not  having\nbeen where the action was.\n\nWhat lousy timing.\n\n\"So  dig  this.   Did you know that the Senate  was  having  open\nsubcommittee hearings on Privacy and Technology Protection?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Neither do a lot of people.  It's been a completely  underplayed\nand underpromoted effort.  Until yesterday that is.  Now the eyes\nof millions are watching. Starting tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow?\" Scott yelled across the Atlantic. \"That's the eighth.\nCongress doesn't usually convene until late January . . .\"\n\n\"Used  to,\" Ty said.  \"The Constitution says that Congress  shall\nmeet  on January third, after the holidays.  Since the  Gulf  War\nCongress  has  returned in the first week.  'Bout time  they  did\nsomething for their paychecks.\"\n\n\"Damn,\" Scott thought out loud.\n\n\"I knew that would excite you,\" Tyrone said sarcastically.   \"And\nthere's more.  Congressman Rickfield, you know who he is?\"  asked\nTyrone.\n\n\"Yeah, sure.  Long timer on the Hill.  Got as many enemies as  he\ndoes  friends.   Wields an immense amount of  power,\"  Scott  re-\ncalled.\n\n\u000f\"Right, exactly.  And that little weasel is the chair.\"\n\n\"I guess you're not on his Christmas list,\" Scott observed.\n\n\"I  really  doubt it,\" Tyrone said. \"But that's off  the  record.\nHe's  been  a Southern racist from day one, a  real  Hoover  man.\nDuring the riots, in the early '60's, he was not exactly a propo-\nnent of civil rights.  In fact that slime ball made Wallace  look\nlike Martin Luther King.\"  Tyrone sounded bitter and derisive  in\nhis  description  of Rickfield.  \"He has no  concept  what  civil\nrights  are.  He makes it a black white issue instead of  one  of\nconstitutional  law.   Stupid bigots are the  worst  kind.\"   The\nderision in Ty's voice was unmistakable.\n\n\"Sounds like you're a big fan.\"\n\n\"I'll  be  a  fan when he hangs high.  Besides  my  personal  and\nracial beliefs about Rickfield, he really is a low life.  He, and\na  few of his cronies are one on the biggest threats to  personal\nfreedom  the  country faces.  He thinks that the Bill  of  Rights\nshould be edited from time to time and now's the time.  He scares\nme.  Especially since there's more like him.\"\n\nIt  was eminently clear that Tyrone Duncan had no place  in  this\nlife for Merrill Rickfield.\n\n\"I know enough about him to dislike him, but on a crowded  subway\nhe'd just be another ugly face.  Excuse my ignorance . . .\"  Then\nit hit him.  Rickfield.  His name had been in those papers he had\nreceived  so long ago.  What had he done, or what was he  accused\nof doing?  Damn, damn, what is it?  There were so many.  Yes,  it\nwas Rickfield, but what was the tie-in?\n\n\"I think you should be there, at the hearings,\" Tyrone suggested.\n\n\"Tomorrow?   Are  you out of your mind?  No  way,\"  Scott  loudly\nprotested.  \"I'm 3000 miles and 8 hours away and it's the  middle\nof the night here,\"  Scott bitched and moaned.  \"Besides, I  only\nhave  to  work  one  more  day and then  I  get  the  weekend  to\nmyself . . . aw, shit.\"\n\nTyrone ignored Scott's infantile objections.  He attributed  them\nto  jet lag and an understandable urge to stay in Sin City for  a\ncouple  more  days.  \"Hollister and Adams will be  there,  and  a\nwhole bunch of white shirts in black hats, and Troubleaux . . .\"\n\n\"Troubleaux did you say?\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's what it says here . . .\"\n\n\"If he's there, then it becomes my concern, too.\"\n\n\"Good,  glad you thought of it,\" joked Tyrone.  \"If you catch  an\nearly  flight,  you  could be in D.C. by noon.\"   He  was  right,\nthought  Scott.  The time difference works in your favor in  that\ndirection.\n\n\"You  know,\"  said Scott, \"with what I've found out  here,  today\nalone, maybe. \"Jeeeeeesus,\" Scott said cringing in indecision.\n\n\"Hey!  Get  your ass back here, boy. Pronto.\"  Tyrone's  friendly\nauthority was persuasive.  \"You know you don't have any  choice.\"\nThe guilt trip.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"\n\nScott  called  his office and asked for Doug.  He got  the  voice\nmail  instead,  and debated about calling him at  home.  Nah,  He\nthought,  I'll  just  leave a message.  This way  I'll  just  get\nyelled at once.\n\n\"Hi, Doug? Scott here.  Change in plans.  Heard about EMP-T.  I'm\nheaded  to Washington tomorrow.  The story here is better than  I\nthought  and dovetails right into why I'm coming back  early.   I\nexpect  to be in D.C. until next Tuesday, maybe  Wednesday.  I'll\ncall when I have a place. Oh, yeah, I learned a limerick here you\nmight  like.  The Spook says the kids around here say it all  the\ntime.   'Mary  had a little lamb, its fleece was white  as  snow.\nAnd  everywhere  that  Mary went, the lamb was sure  to  go.   It\nfollowed  her to school one day and a big black dog  fucked  it.'\nThat's Amsterdam.  Bye.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                              Chapter 20\n\n     Friday, January 8\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nThe New Senate Office Building is a moderately impressive  struc-\nture  on  the edge of one of the worst  sections  of  Washington.\nVisitors  find it a perpetual paradox that the power seat of  the\nWestern  World  is located within a virtual shooting  gallery  of\ndrugs  and weapons.  Scott arrived at the NSOB near the  capitol,\njust before lunchtime.  His press identification got him  instant\naccess  to  the hearing room and into  the  privileged  locations\nwhere  the media congregated.  The hearings were in progress  and\nas solemn as he remembered other hearings broadcast on late night\nC-SPAN.\n\nHe caught the last words of wisdom from a government employee who\nworked for NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technol-\nogy.   The agency was formerly known as NBS, National  Bureau  of\nStandards, and no one could adequately explain the change.\n\nThe  NIST employee droned on about how seriously the  government,\nand more specifically, his agency cared about privacy and  infor-\nmation  security, and that \". . .the government was doing all  it\ncould  to provide the requisite amount of  security  commensurate\nwith  the  perceived risk of disclosure and  sensitivity  of  the\ninformation  in  question.\"  Scott ran into a  couple  of  fellow\nreporters  who told him he was lucky to show up late.  All  morn-\ning, the government paraded witnesses to read prepared statements\nabout how they were protecting the interests of the Government.\n\nIt was an intensive lobbying effort, they told Scott, to shore up\nwhatever  attacks might be made on the  government's  inefficient\nbungling in distinction to its efficient bungling.  To a man, the\nwitnesses  assured the Senate committee that they were  committed\nto guaranteeing privacy of information and unconvincingly  assur-\ning  them that only appropriate authorized people have access  to\nsensitive and classified data.\n\nSeven  sequential propagandized statements went  unchallenged  by\nthe  three senior committee members throughout the  morning,  and\nSenator  Rickfield went out of his way to thank the speakers  for\ntheir  time, adding that he was personally convinced the  Govern-\nment  was indeed doing more than necessary to obviate  such  con-\ncerns.\n\nThe  underadvertised Senate Select Sub Committee on  Privacy  and\nTechnology  Protection  convened in Hearing Room 3 on the  second\nfloor  of the NSOB.  About 400 could be accommodated in the  huge\nlight wood paneled room on both the main floor and in the balcony\nthat wrapped around half of the room.  The starkness of the  room\nwas emphasized by the glare of arc and fluorescent lighting.\n\nScott  found an empty seat on a wooden bench directly behind  the\ntables from which the witnesses would speak to the raised  wooden\ndais.  He noticed that the attendance was extraordinarily low; by\nboth the public and the press.  Probably due to the total lack of\nexposure.\n\nAs  the session broke for lunch, Scott asked why the TV  cameras?\nHe  thought  this hearing was a deep dark secret.   A  couple  of\nfellow journalists agreed, and the only reason they had found out\nabout the Rickfield hearings was because the CNN producer  called\nthem asking if they knew anything about them.  Apparently,  Scott\nwas told, CNN received an anonymous call, urging them to be  part\nof  a  blockbuster  announcement.  When  CNN  called  Rickfield's\noffice,  his  staffers told CNN that there was no big  deal,  and\nthat they shouldn't waste their time.  In the news business, that\nkind  of  statement from a Congressional power broker is  a  sure\nsign that it is worth being there.  Just in case. So CNN assigned\na novice producer and a small crew to the first day of the  hear-\nings.  As promised, the morning session was an exercise in termi-\nnal boredom.\n\nThe afternoon session was to begin at 1:30, but Senator Rickfield\nwas  nowhere  to be found, so the Assistant  Chairperson  of  the\ncommittee, Junior Senator Nancy Deere assumed control.  She was a\n44  year  old grandmother of two from New England who  had  never\nconsidered  entering  politics.  Nancy Deere was  the  consummate\nwife,  supporter and stalwart of her husband Morgan Deere, an  up\nand  coming  national politician who had the  unique  mixture  of\nhonesty,  appeal  and potential. She had spent full time  on  the\ncampaign trail with Morgan as he attempted to make the transition\nfrom  state  politics to Washington.  Morgan  Deere  was  heavily\nfavored  to  win after the three term incumbent was named  a  co-\nconspirator  in the rigging of a Defense contract.   Despite  the\npending  indictments, the race continued with constant  pleadings\nby  the  incumbent that the trumped up charges would  shortly  be\ndismissed.  In the first week after the Grand Jury was  convened,\nthe  voter  polls  indicated that Deere led with  a  70%  support\nfactor.\n\nThen  came  the accident.  On his way home from  a  fund  raising\ndinner,  Morgan Deere's limousine was run off an icy winter  road\nby a drunk driver.  Deere's resulting injuries made it impossible\nfor  him to continue the campaign or even be sure that  he  would\never be able to regain enough strength to withstand the brutality\nof Washington politics.\n\nWithin  days of the accident, Deere's campaign manager  announced\nthat  Nancy  Deere would replace her husband.   Due  to  Morgan's\nlocal  popularity, and the fact that the state was so small  that\neveryone  knew everyone else's business, and that  the  incumbent\nwas  going  to jail, and that the elections were  less  than  two\nweeks away, there was barely a spike in the projections.  No  one\nseemed  to care that Nancy Deere had no experience  in  politics;\nthey just liked her.\n\nWhat remained of the campaign was run on her part with impeccable\nstyle.   Unlike her opponent who spent vast sums to besmirch  her\non  television,  Nancy's campaign was largely waged on  news  and\nnational  talk shows.  Her husband was popular, as was  she,  and\nthe general interest in her as a woman outweighed the interest in\nher  politics.  The state's constituency overwhelmingly  endorsed\nher  with  their votes and Senator Nancy Deere, one  of  the  few\nwoman ever to reach that level as an elected official, was on her\nway to Washington.\n\nNancy  Deere  found  that many of  the  professional  politicians\npreferred to ignore her; they were convinced she was bound to  be\na one termer once the GOP got someone to run against her.  Others\nfound  her  to  be a genuine pain in the butt.  Not  due  to  her\nnaivete, far from that, she adeptly acclimated to the culture and\nthe system.  Rather, she was a woman and she broke the rules. She\nsaid what she felt; she echoed the sentiments of her constituency\nwhich  were  largely unpopular politically.  Nancy  Deere  didn't\ncare  what official Washington thought; her state was behind  her\nwith  an almost unanimous approval and it was her sworn  duty  to\nrepresent them honestly and without compromise.  She had  nothing\nto lose by being herself.  After  more than a year in Washington,\nshe  learned how the massive Washington machinery functioned  and\nwhy it crawled with a hurry up and wait engine.\n\nIn Rickfield's absence, at 1:40 P.M., Senator Nancy Deere  called\nthe  session to order.  Her administrative demeanor gave  no  one\npause  to question her authority.  Even the other  sole  Congres-\nsional  representative  on  the  sub-committee  fell  into  step.\nWhile  Senator Stanley Paglusi technically had seniority, he  sat\non  the  committee at Rickfield's request and  held  no  specific\ninterest  in  the  subject matter they  were  investigating.   He\naccepted  the  seat to mollify Rickfield and to add  to  his  own\npolitical resume.\n\n\"Come  to  order,  please,\" she announced over  the  ample  sound\nsystem.   The  voluminous hearing room reacted  promptly  to  the\nauthoritative  command that issued forth from the  petite  auburn\nhaired  Nancy Deere who would have been just as comfortable  auc-\ntioning donated goods at her church.  She noticed that unlike the\nmorning session, the afternoon session was packed. The press pool\nwas  nearly full and several people were forced to  stand.   What\nhad changed, she asked herself.\n\nAfter  the  procedural  formalities  were  completed,  she  again\nthanked those who had spoken to the committee in the morning, and\nthen  promised an equally informative afternoon.  Nancy,  as  she\nliked to be called on all but the most formal of occasions intro-\nduced the committee's first afternoon witness.\n\n\"Our  next speaker is Ted Hammacher, a recognized expert  on  the\nsubject  of computer and information security.  During  17  years\nwith the Government, Mr. Hammacher worked with the Defense Inves-\ntigatory  Agency and the National Security Agency as a DoD  liai-\nson.   He is currently a security consultant to industry and  the\ngovernment  and  is  the author of hundreds of  articles  on  the\nsubject.\"   As  was required, Nancy  Deere  outlined  Hammacher's\nqualifications  as  an expert, and then invited him to  give  his\nopening statement.\n\nThe  television in Rickfield's office was tuned to  C-SPAN  which\nwas broadcasting the hearings as he spoke into the phone.\n\n\"Only  a  couple more and then I'm off to spend my  days  in  the\ncompany  of  luscious  maidens on the island of  my  choice,\"  he\nbragged  into  the phone.  The Senator listened intently  to  the\nresponse.   \"Yes, I am aware of that, but it doesn't  change  the\nfact  that I'm calling it quits.  I cannot, I will not,  continue\nthis  charade.\"  He listened quietly for several  minutes  before\ninterjecting.\n\n\"Listen,  General,  we've both made enough money to  keep  us  in\nstyle  for the rest of our lives, and I will not jeopardize  that\nfor anything.  Got it?\"  Again he listened.  \"I don't know  about\nyou, but I do not relish the idea of doing ten to twenty  regard-\nless of how much of a country club the prison is.  It is still  a\nprison.\"  He listened further.\n\n\"That's  it, I've had it!  Don't make me use that file to  impli-\ncate you, the guys over at State and our Import . . .hey!\"  Rick-\nfield turned to Ken Boyers.  \"Who started the afternoon session?\"\nHe pointed at the TV.\n\n\"It looks like Senator Deere,\" Ken said.\n\n\"Deere? Where does that goddamned bitch get off . . ?\"  He remem-\nbered the phone.  \"General?  I have to go, I've got a suffragette\nusurping a little power, and I have to put her back in her place.\nYou understand.  But, on that other matter, I'm out. Done.  Fini-\nto.   Do what you want, but keep me the fuck out of  it.\"   Rick-\nfield hung up abruptly and stared at the broadcast.  \"Some house-\nbroken  homemaker is not going to make me look bad.  Goddamn  it,\nKen,\" Rickfield said as he stood up quickly.  \"Let's get back out\nthere.\"\n\n\"Thank  you, Senator Deere, and committee members.  I am  honored\nto have a chance to speak to you here today.  As a preface to  my\nremarks,  I  think that a brief history of security  and  privacy\nfrom a government perspective may be in order. One of the reasons\nwe are here today is due to a succession of events that since the\nintroduction  of the computer have shaped an ad hoc anarchism,  a\nlaissez-faire attitude toward privacy and security.  Rather  than\na comprehensive national policy, despite the valiant efforts of a\nfew  able Congressmen, the United States of America  has  allowed\nitself to be lulled into technical complacency and  indifference.\nTherefore,  I  will,  if the committee agrees,  provide  a  brief\nchronological record.\"\n\n\"I  for one would be most interested,\" said Senator  Deere.   \"It\nappeared  that  this morning our speakers assumed  we  were  more\nknowledgeable  that  we are.   Any clarifications  will  be  most\nwelcome.\"   The crowd agreed silently.  Much of the  history  was\ncloaked in secrecy.\n\nThe  distinguished  Ted  Hammacher was  an  accomplished  orator,\nutilizing the best that Washington diplomatic-speak could muster.\nAt  50  years old, his short cropped white hair capped  a  proper\nmilitary bearing even though he had maintained a civilian  status\nthroughout   his   Pentagon  associations.   \"Thank   you   madam\nchairman.\"   He  glanced down at the well  organized  folder  and\nturned a page.\n\n\"Concerns  of privacy can be traced back thousands of years  with\nperhaps  the Egyptian pyramids as the first classic example of  a\nbrute  force  approach towards privacy.  The first  recorded  at-\ntempts  at disguising the contents of a written message  were  in\nRoman  times when Julius Caesar encoded messages to his  generals\nin the field.  The Romans used a simple substitution cipher where\none  letter  in the alphabet is used in place  of  another.   The\ncryptograms  found in the Sunday paper use the  same  techniques.\nAny  method by which a the contents of a message is scrambled  is\nknown as encryption.\"\n\nThe  CNN producer maintained the sole camera shot and his  atten-\ntion  on Ted Hammacher.  He missed Senator Rickfield and his  aid\nreappear  on the dais.  Rickfield's eyes penetrated  Nancy  Deere\nwho imperceptibly acknowledged his return. \"You should not  over-\nstep  your bounds,\" Rickfield leaned over and said to her.   \"You\nhave  five years to go. Stunts like this will not make your  time\nany easier.\"\n\n\"Senator,\"  she  said to Rickfield as Hammacher spoke.  \"You  are\nobviously not familiar with the procedures of Senate panel proto-\ncol.  I was merely trying to assist the progress of the  hearings\nin  your absence, I assure you.\"   Her coolness infuriated  Rick-\nfield.\n\n\"Well,  then,  thank you,\" he sneered. \"But, now, I am  back.   I\nwill  appreciate no further procedural interference.\"  He sat  up\nbrusquely  indicating that his was the last word on the  subject.\nUnaware  of the political sidebar in progress, Hammacher  contin-\nued.\n\n\"Ciphers  were  evolved over the centuries until they  reached  a\ntemporary plateau during World War II.  The Germans used the most\nsophisticated message encoding or encryption device ever devised.\nSuitably  called the Enigma, their encryption scheme  was  nearly\nuncrackable  until  the Allies captured one of the  devices,  and\nthen  under the leadership of Alan Turing, a method was found  to\nregularly decipher intercepted German High Command orders.   Many\nhistorians consider this effort as being instrumental in bringing\nabout an end to the war.\n\n\"In  the years immediately following World War II, the only  per-\nceived  need  for secrecy was by the military  and  the  emerging\nintelligence  services,  namely the OSS as it became  the  modern\nCIA, the British MI-5 and MI-6 and of course our opponents on the\nother side.  In an effort to maintain a technological  leadership\nposition, the National Security Agency funded various projects to\ndevelop encryption schemes that would adequately protect  govern-\nment information and communications for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"The first such requests were issued in 1972 but it wasn't  until\n1974  that the National Bureau of Standards accepted an IBM  pro-\nposal   for  an encryption process known as  Lucifer.   With  the\nassistance  of the NSA who is responsible for  cryptography,  the\nData Encryption Standard was approved in November of 1976.  There\nwas an accompanying furor over the DES, some saying that the  NSA\nintentionally weakened it to insure that they could still decrypt\nany messages using the approved algorithm.\n\n\"In 1982  a financial group, FIMAS endorsed a DES based method to\nauthenticate  Electronic  Funds  Transfer, or  EFT.   Banks  move\nupwards  of a trillion dollars daily, and in an effort to  insure\nthat all monies are moved accurately and to their intended desti-\nnations,  the  technique  of Message  Authentication  Coding  was\nintroduced.   For still unknown reasons it was decided  that  en-\ncrypting the contents of the messages, or transfers, was unneces-\nsary.    Thus, financial transactions are still carried out  with\nno protection from eavesdropping.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Hammacher, I want to understand this,\" interrupt-\ned Senator Deere.  \"Are you saying that, since 1976, we have  had\nthe ability to camouflage the nation's financial networks, yet as\nof today, they are still unprotected?\"  Rickfield looked over  at\nNancy in disgust but the single camera missed it.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, that's exactly the case,\" replied Hammacher.\n\n\"What does that mean to us? The Government? Or the average  citi-\nzen?\"\n\n\"In  my  opinion it borders on insanity.  It means that  for  the\nprice  of a bit of electronic equipment, anyone can tap into  the\ndetails  of the financial dealings of banks, the  government  and\nevery citizen in this country.\"\n\nSenator Deere visibly gulped.  \"Thank you, please continue.\"\n\n\"In  1984,  President Reagan signed  National  Security  Decision\nDirective 145.  NSDD-145 established that defense contractors and\nother organizations that handle sensitive or classified  informa-\ntion  must adhere to certain security and privacy guidelines.   A\nnumber  of  advisory groups were established, and  to  a  minimal\nextent,  the  recommendations have been implemented, but  I  must\nemphasize, to a minimal extent.\"\n\n\"Can you be a little more specific, Mr. Hammacher?\" Asked Senator\nDeere.\n\n\"No ma'am, I can't.  A great deal of these efforts are classified\nand  by divulging who is not currently in compliance would  be  a\nsecurity  violation in itself.  It would be fair to say,  though,\nthat the majority of those organizations targeted for  additional\nsecurity  measures fall far short of the government's  intentions\nand desires.  I am sorry I cannot be more specific.\"\n\n\"I understand completely.  Once again,\" Nancy said to  Hammacher,\n\"I am sorry to interrupt.\"\n\n\"Not  at all, Senator.\"  Hammacher sipped from his  water  glass.\n\"As you can see, the interest in security was primarily from  the\ngovernment,  and  more specifically the  defense  community.   In\n1981, the Department of Defense chartered the DoD Computer  Secu-\nrity Center which has since become the National Computer Security\nCenter  operating  under the auspices of  the  National  Security\nAgency.  In 1983 they published a series of guidelines to be used\nin  the creation or evaluation of computer security.   Officially\ntitled  the Trusted Computer Security Evaluation Criteria, it  is\npopularly  known  as  the Orange Book.   It has  had  some  minor\nupdates  since then, but by and large it is an outdated  document\ndesigned for older computer architectures.\n\n\"The  point to be made here is that while the government  had  an\nostensible interest and concern about the security of  computers,\nespecially  those  under their control, there  was  virtually  no\novert significance placed upon the security of private industry's\ncomputers.   Worse yet, it was not until 1987 that  any  proposed\ncriteria  were  developed for networked computers.   So,  as  the\nworld  tied itself together with millions of computers  and  net-\nworks,  the  Government was not concerned enough to  address  the\nissue.  Even today, there are no secure network criteria that are\nuniversally accepted.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hammacher.\"  Senator Rickfield spoke up for the first  time.\n\"You  appear  to have a most demeaning tone with respect  to  the\nUnited  States Government's ability to manage itself.  I for  one\nremain  unconvinced  that  we are as  derelict  as  you  suggest.\nTherefore, I would ask that you stick to the subject at hand, the\nfacts, and leave your personal opinions at home.\"\n\nNancy  Deere as well as much of the audience listened in  awe  as\nRickfield  slashed  out at Hammacher who was in  the  process  of\nbuilding  an argument.  Common courtesy demanded that he be  per-\nmitted  to  finish his statement, even if  his  conclusions  were\nunpopular or erroneous.\n\nHammacher  did not seem fazed.  \"Sir, I am recounting the  facts,\nand  only the facts.  My personal opinions would only be  further\ndamning,  so I agree, that I will refrain.\"  He turned a page  in\nhis notebook and continued.\n\n\"Several  laws were passed, most notably Public Law 100-235,  the\nComputer Security Act of 1987.  This weak law called for enhanced\ncooperation  between  the NSA and NIST in the  administration  of\nsecurity for the sensitive but unclassified world of the  Govern-\nment  and the private sector.  Interestingly enough, in mid  1990\nit was announced, that after a protracted battle between the  two\nsecurity agencies, the NCSC would shut down and merge its efforts\nwith  its  giant super secret parent, the  NSA.   President  Bush\nsigned  the  Directive effectively replacing  Reagan's  NSDD-145.\nBecause  the  budgeting and appropriations for both NSA  and  the\nformer  NCSC are classified, there is no way to accurately  gauge\nthe effectiveness of this move.  It may still be some time before\nwe understand the ramifications of the new Executive Order.\n\n\"To date every state has some kind of statute designed to  punish\ncomputer  crime,  but prosecutions that involve the  crossing  of\nstate lines in the commission of a crime are far and few between.\nOnly 1% of all computer criminals are prosecuted and less than 5%\nof those result in convictions.  In short, the United States  has\ndone  little or nothing to forge an appropriate  defense  against\ncomputer  crime, despite the political gerrymandering and  agency\nshuffling  over the last decade.  That concludes my  opening  re-\nmarks.\"  Hammacher sat back in his chair and finished the  water.\nHe  turned to his lawyer and whispered something  Scott  couldn't\nhear.\n\n\"Ah,  Mr. Hammacher, before you continue, I would like ask a  few\nquestions.   Do  you mind?\"  Senator Nancy Deere  was  being  her\nusual gracious self.\n\n\"Not at all, Senator.\"\n\n\"You  said earlier that the NSA endorsed a  cryptographic  system\nthat they themselves could crack.  Could you elaborate?\"  Senator\nNancy Deere's ability to grasp an issue at the roots was uncanny.\n\n\"I'd  be pleased to.  First of all, it is only one  opinion  that\nthe  NSA  can crack DES; it has never been proven  or  disproven.\nWhen  DES was first introduced some theoreticians felt  that  NSA\nhad  compromised the original integrity of IBM's Lucifer  encryp-\ntion project.  I am not qualified to comment either way, but  the\nreduction  of the key length, and the functional feedback  mecha-\nnisms  were less stringent than the original.  If this  is  true,\nthen  we  have to ask ourselves, why?  Why would the NSA  want  a\nweaker system?\"\n\nA  number of heads in the hearing room nodded in  agreement  with\nthe question; others merely acknowledged that it was NSA  bashing\ntime again.\n\nHammacher continued.  \"There is one theory that suggests that the\nNSA,  as the largest eavesdropping operation in the world  wanted\nto  make  sure that they could still listen in on  messages  once\nthey  have  been  encrypted.  The NSA has  neither  confirmed  or\ndenied  these  reports.  If that is true, then we must  ask  our-\nselves, if DES is so weak, why does the NSA have the ultimate say\non export control.  The export of DES is restricted by the  Muni-\ntions  Control, Department of State, and they rely upon  DoD  and\nthe NSA for approval.\n\n\"The  export controls suggest that maybe NSA cannot decrypt  DES,\nand  there  is some evidence to support that.   For  example,  in\n1985, the Department of Treasury wanted to extend the  validation\nof  DES  for  use throughout the Treasury,  the  Federal  Reserve\nSystem  and member banks.  The NSA put a lot of political  muscle\nbehind  an effort to have DES deaffirmed and replaced with  newer\nencryption  algorithms.   Treasury argued that they  had  already\nadapted DES, their constituents had spent millions on DES  equip-\nment  for EFT and it would be entirely too cumbersome and  expen-\nsive  to  make a change now.  Besides, they asked,  what's  wrong\nwith  DES?  They never got an answer to that question,  and  thus\nthey  won  the battle and DES is still  the  approved  encryption\nmethodology for banks.  It was never established whether DES  was\ntoo strong or too weak for NSA's taste.\n\n\"Later, in 1987, the NSA received an application for export of  a\nDES  based device that employed a technique called  infinite  en-\ncryption. In response to the frenzy over the strength or weakness\nof  DES,  one  company took DES and folded it over  and  over  on\nitself using multiple keys.  The NSA had an internal  hemorrhage.\nThey  forbade  this product from being exported from  the  United\nStates in any form whatsoever.  Period.  It was an  extraordinary\nmove on their part, and one that had built-in contradictions.  If\nDES  is  weak, then why not export it?  If it's too  strong,  why\nargue  with Treasury?  In any case, the multiple DES  issue  died\ndown  until recently, when NSA, beaten at their own game  by  too\nmuch  secrecy,  developed a secret internal program to  create  a\nMultiple-DES encryption standard with a minimum of three  sequen-\ntial iterations.\n\n\"Further  embarrassment was caused when an Israeli  mathematician\nfound the 'trap door' built into DES by the NSA and how to decode\nmessages  in seconds.  This quite clearly suggests that the  gov-\nernment  has been listening in on supposedly secret  and  private\ncommunications.\n\n\"Then  we  have to look at another event that  strongly  suggests\nthat NSA has something to hide.\"\n\n\"Mr. Hammacher!\" Shouted Senator Rickfield.  \"I warned you  about\nthat.\"\n\n\"I  see nothing wrong with his comments, Senator,\"   Deere  said,\ncareful to make sure that she was heard over the sound system.\n\n\"I  am the chairman of this committee, Ms. Deere, and I find  Mr.\nHammacher's characterization of the NSA as unfitting this  forum.\nI  wish he would find other words or eliminate the thought  alto-\ngether.  Mr. Hammacher, do you think you are capable of that?\"\n\nHammacher seethed.  \"Senator, I mean no disrespect to you or this\ncommittee.   However, I was asked to testify, and at my  own  ex-\npense I am providing as accurate information as possible. If  you\nhappen to find anything I say not to your liking, I do apologize,\nbut my only alternative is not to testify at all.\"\n\n\"We  accept  your withdrawal, Mr. Hammacher, thank you  for  your\ntime.\"  A hushed silence covered the hearing room.  This was  not\nthe  time to get into it with Rickfield, Nancy thought.   He  has\nsufficiently embarrassed himself and the media will take care  of\nthe rest.  Why the hell is he acting this way?  He is known as  a\nhard ass, a real case, but his public image was unblemished.  Had\nthe job passed him by?\n\nA  stunned and incensed Hammacher gathered his belongings as  his\nlawyer  placated  him.  Scott overheard bits and pieces  as  they\nboth  agreed that Rickfield was a flaming asshole.  A  couple  of\nreporters  hurriedly followed them out of the hearing room for  a\none on one interview.\n\n\"Is Dr. Sternman ready?\"  Rickfield asked.\n\nA  bustle  of activity and a man spoke to the  dais  without  the\nassistance of a microphone.  \"Yessir, I am.\"\n\nSternman was definitely the academic type, Scott noted.  A  crum-\npled  ill fitting brown suit covering a small hunched  body  that\nwas  no more than 45 years old.  He held an old scratched  brief-\ncase and an armful of folders and envelopes.  Scott was  reminded\nof  the  studious high school student that jocks  enjoy  tripping\nwith  their feet.  Dr. Sternman busied himself to straighten  the\npapers  that  fell onto the desk and his performance  received  a\nbrief titter from the crowd.\n\n\"Ah,  yes, Mr. Chairman,\" Sternman said. \"I'm ready now.\"   Rick-\nfield looked as bored as ever.\n\n\"Thank  you,  Dr. Sternman.  You are, I  understand,  a  computer\nvirus expert?  Is that correct?\"\n\n\"Yessir.  My doctoral thesis was on the subject and I have  spent\nseveral  years researching computer viruses, their  proliferation\nand propagation.\"  Rickfield groaned to himself.   Unintelligible\nmumbo jumbo.\n\n\"I  also understand that your comments will be brief as  we  have\nsomeone  else yet to hear from today.\"  It was as much a  command\nas a question.\n\n\"Yessir, it will be brief.\"\n\n\"Then,  please, enlighten us, what is a virus expert and what  do\nyou do?\"  Rickfield grinned menacingly at Dr. Les Sternman,  Pro-\nfessor  of Applied Theoretical Mathematics, Massachusetts  Insti-\ntute of Technology.\n\n\"I  believe  the committee has received an advance copy  of  some\nnotes  I  made on the nature of computer viruses and  the  danger\nthey represent?\"  Rickfield hadn't read anything, so he looked at\nBoyers who also shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Yes,  Dr.  Sternman,\" Nancy Deere said,  \"and we thank  you  for\nyour  consideration.\"   Rickfield glared at her as  she  politely\nupstaged  him yet again.  \"May I ask, though, that you provide  a\nbrief  description of a computer virus for the benefit  of  those\nwho have not read your presentation?\"  She stuck it to  Rickfield\nagain.\n\n\"I'd be happy to, madam Chairwoman,\" he said nonchalantly.  Rick-\nfield's neck turned red at the inadvertent sudden rise in Senator\nDeere's  stature. For the next several minutes Sternman  solemnly\ndescribed what a virus was, how it worked and a history of  their\nattacks.  He told the committee about Worms, Trojan Horses,  Time\nBombs,  Logic  Bombs,  Stealth Viruses, Crystal  Viruses  and  an\nassorted  family  of  similar  surreptitious  computer  programs.\nDespite  Sternman's sermonly manner, his audience found the  sub-\nject matter fascinating.\n\n\"The  reason  you are here, Dr. Sternman, is to bring  us  up  to\nspeed on computer viruses, which you have done with alacrity, and\nwe  appreciate that.\"  Rickfield held seniority, but Nancy  Deere\ntook charge due to her preparation.  \"Now that we have an  under-\nstanding  of  the virus, can you give us an idea of the  type  of\nproblems that they cause?\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, but I need to say something here,\" Sternman said.\n\n\"Please, proceed,\" Rickfield said politely.\n\n\"When I first heard about replicating software, viruses, and this\nwas  over 15 years ago, I, as many of my graduate  students  did,\nthought of them as a curious anomaly.  A benign subset of comput-\ner  software  that  had no anticipated  applications.   We  spent\nmonths  working  with viruses, self cloning  software  and  built\nmathematical  models of their behavior which fit quite neatly  in\nthe domain of conventional set theory.  Then an amazing discovery\nbefell us.  We proved mathematically that there is absolutely  no\neffective way to protect against computer viruses in software.\"\n\nEnough  of the spectators had heard about viruses over  the  past\nfew years to comprehend the purport of that one compelling state-\nment.   Even  Senator Rickfield joined Nancy and  the  others  in\ntheir awe.  No way to combat viruses?   Dr. Sternman had  dropped\na bombshell on them.\n\n\"Dr. Sternman,\" said Senator Deere, \"could you repeat that?\n\n\"Yes,  yes,\" Sternman replied, knowing the impact of  his  state-\nment.   \"That  is correct.  A virus is a piece  of  software  and\nsoftware is designed to do specific tasks in a hardware  environ-\nment.  All software uses basically the same techniques to do  its\njob.  Without all of the technicalities, if one piece of software\ncan  do something, another piece of software can un-do it.   It's\nkind of a computer arms race.\n\n\"I build a virus, and you build a program to protect against that\none  virus.   It works.  But then I make a small  change  in  the\nvirus  to attack or bypass your software, and Poof!  I  blow  you\naway.   Then you build a new piece of software to defend  against\nboth  my first virus and my mutated virus and that works until  I\nbuild yet another.  This process can go on forever, and  frankly,\nit's just not worth the effort.\"\n\n\"What is not worth the effort, Doctor?\" Asked Nancy Deere.   \"You\npaint a most bleak picture.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to at all, Senator.\"  Dr. Sternman smiled soothing-\nly  up at the committee and took off his round horn rim  glasses.\n\"I  wasn't attempting to be melodramatic, however these  are  not\nopinions or guesses.  They are facts.  It is not worth the effort\nto fight computer viruses with software.  The virus builders will\nwin because the Virus Busters are the ones playing catch-up.\"\n\n\"Virus Busters?\"  Senator Rickfield mockingly said  conspicuously\nraising  his eyebrows.  His reaction elicited a wave of  laughter\nfrom the hall.\n\n\"Yessir,\"  said  Dr.  Sternman  to  Rickfield.   \"Virus  Busters.\nThat's  a term to describe programmers who fight  viruses.   They\nmistakenly believe they can fight viruses with defensive software\nand  some  of them sell some incredibly poor programs.   In  many\ncases you're better off not using anything at all.\n\n\"You see, there is no way to write a program that can predict the\npotential  behavior of other software in such a way that it  will\nnot interfere with normal computer operations.  So, the only  way\nto find a virus is to already know what it looks like, and go out\nlooking  for  it.   There are several major  problems  with  this\napproach.   First of all, the virus has already struck  and  done\nsome damage.  Two it has already infected other software and will\ncontinue  to spread.  Three, a program must be written to  defeat\nthe  specific  virus usually using a unique  signature  for  each\nvirus,  and the vaccine for the virus must be distributed to  the\ncomputer users.\n\n\"This  process can take from three to twelve months, and  by  the\ntime the virus vaccine has been deployed, the very same virus has\nbeen changed, mutated, and the vaccine is useless against it.  So\nyou  see,  the Virus Busters are really wasting their  time,  and\nworst  of all they are deceiving the public.\"  Dr. Sternman  com-\npleted what he had to say with surprising force.\n\n\"Doctor Sternman,\"  Senator Rickfield said with disdain,  \"all of\nyour  theories  are well and good, and perhaps they work  in  the\nlaboratory. But isn't it true, sir, that computer viruses are  an\noverblown issue that the media has sensationalized and that  they\nare nothing more than a minor inconvenience?\"\n\n\"Not really, Senator.  The statistics don't support that  conclu-\nsion,\"  Dr. Sternman said with conviction.  \"That is one  of  the\nworst myths.\"  Nancy Deere smiled to herself as the dorky college\nprofessor  handed  it  right to a United  States  Senator.   \"The\nincidence of computer viruses has been on a logarithmic  increase\nfor  the past several years.  If a human disease infected at  the\nsame rate, we would declare a medical state of emergency.\"\n\n\"Doctor,\" implored Rickfield.  \"Aren't you exaggerating . . .?\"\n\n\"No  Senator, here are the facts.  There are currently over  5000\nknown  computer  viruses and strains that  have  been  positively\nidentified.   Almost five thousand, Senator.\"   The  good  Doctor\nwas  a skilled debater, and Rickfield was being sucked in by  his\nattack  on  the  witness.  The figure  three  thousand  impressed\neveryone.   A few low whistles echoed through the large  chamber.\nStupid move Merrill, though Nancy.\n\n\"It  is estimated, sir, that at the current rate, there  will  be\nover  100,000 active viruses in five years,\"  Dr. Sternman  dryly\nspoke  to  Rickfield, \"that every single network  in  the  United\nStates,  Canada and the United Kingdom is infected with at  least\none computer virus.  That is the equivalent of having one  member\nof every family in the country being sick at all times.  That  is\nan epidemic, and one that will not go away. No sir, it will not.\"\nSternman's  voice rose.  \"It will not go away.  It will only  get\nworse.\"\n\n\"That  is a most apoplectic prophesy, Doctor.  I think that  many\nof  us would have trouble believing the doom and gloom  you  por-\ntend.\"  Rickfield was sloughing off the Doctor, but Sternman  was\nhere to tell a story, and he would finish.\n\n\"There  is more, Senator.  Recent reports show that over  75%  of\nthe computers in the People's Republic of China are infected with\ndeadly  and  destructive software.  Why?  The look on  your  face\nasks  the question.  Because, almost every piece of  software  in\nthat  country  is bootleg, illegal copies  of  popular  programs.\nThat  invites viruses.   Since vast quantities of computers  come\nfrom the Pacific Rim, many with prepackaged software, new comput-\ner  equipment is a source of computer viruses that was once  con-\nsidered safe.  Modem manufacturers have accidentally had  viruses\non their communications software; several major domestic software\nmanufacturers have had their shrink-wrapped software infected.\n\n\"If you recall in 1989, NASA brought Virus Busters to Cape Kenne-\ndy  and  Houston to thwart a particular virus that  threatened  a\nspace launch.  A year later as everyone remembers, NASA computers\nwere invaded forcing officials to abort a flight.  The attacks go\non, and they inflict greater damage than is generally thought.\n\n\"Again, these are our best estimates, that over 90% of all  viral\ninfections go unreported.\"\n\n\"Doctor, 90%?  Isn't that awfully high?\"  Nancy asked.\n\n\"Definitely, yes, but imagine the price of speaking out.  I  have\ntalked  to  hundreds of companies, major corporations,  that  are\nabsolutely terrified of anyone knowing that their computers  have\nbeen  infected.   Or they have been the target  of  any  computer\ncrime for that matter.  They feel that the public, their  custom-\ners,  maybe  even  their stockholders, might lose  faith  in  the\ncompany's ability to protect itself.  So?  Most viral attacks  go\nunreported.\n\n\"It's akin to computer rape.\"  Dr. Sternman had a way with  words\nto  keep his audience attentive.  Years of lecturing to  sleeping\nfreshman  had  taught him a few tricks.   \"A  computer  virus  is\nuninvited,  it invades the system, and then has its way with  it.\nIf that's not rape, I don't know what is.\"\n\n\"Your  parallels are most vivid,\" said a grimacing  Nancy  Deere.\n\"Let's leave that thought for now, and maybe you can explain  the\ntype  of damage that a virus can do.  It sounds to me like  there\nare  thousands of new diseases out there, and every one needs  to\nbe  isolated, diagnosed and then cured.  That appears to me to  a\nformidable challenge.\"\n\n\"I  could  not  have put it better, Senator.   You  grasp  things\nquickly.\"   Sternman  was  genuinely  complimenting  Nancy.  \"The\nsimilarities  to the medical field cannot go unnoticed if we  are\nto deal with the problem rationally and effectively.  And like  a\ndisease,  we need to predict the effects of the infection.   What\nwe have found in that area is as frightening.\n\n\"The  first generation of viruses were simple in their  approach.\nThe designers correctly assumed that no one was looking for them,\nand they could enter systems without any deterrence.  They  erase\nfiles, scramble data, re-format hard drives . . .make the comput-\ner data useless.\n\n\"Then  the  second  generation of viruses  came  along  with  the\nnom-de-guerre stealth.  These viruses hid themselves more  elabo-\nrately  to avoid detection and had a built  in  self-preservation\ninstinct.   If  the virus thinks it's being probed, it  self  de-\nstructs or hides itself even further.\n\n\"In  addition,  second generation viruses learned how  to  become\ntargeted.   Some  viruses  have been designed to  only  attack  a\ncompetitor's product and nothing else.\"\n\n\"Is that possible?\" Asked Nancy Deere.\n\n\"It's been done many times.  Some software bugs in popular  soft-\nware  are the result of viral infections, others may  be  genuine\nbugs.  Imagine  a virus who sole purpose is to attack  Lotus  123\nspreadsheets.   The  virus is designed  to  create  computational\nerrors in the program's spreadsheets.  The user then thinks  that\nLotus is to blame and so he buys another product.  Yes, ma'am, it\nis  possible, and occurs every day of the week.  Keeping up  with\nit is the trick.\n\n\"Other viruses attack on Friday the 13th. only, some attack  only\nat a specified time . . .the damage to be done is only limited by\nimagination  of the programmers.  Third generation  viruses  were\neven  more  sophisticated.  They were designed to do  damage  not\nonly to the data, but to the computer hardware itself.  Some were\ndesigned  to  overload communications ports  with  tight  logical\nloops.  Others were designed to destroy the hard disk by directly\noverdriving  the disk or would cause amonitor  to  self-destruct.\nThere is no limit to the possibilities.\n\n\"You  sound as though you hold their skills in high regard,  Doc-\ntor.\"  Rickfield continued to make snide remarks whenever  possi-\nble.\n\n\u000f\"Yessir, I do.  Many of them have extraordinary skills, that are\nunfortunately   misguided.   They  are  a  new  breed  of   bored\ncriminal.\"\n\n\"You  mentioned earlier Doctor, that there were over  5000  known\nviruses.   How fast is the epidemic, as you put  it,  spreading?\"\nSenator Nancy Deere asked while making prolific notes throughout.\n\n\"For  all  intents and purposes Senator, they  spread  unchecked.\nThere is a certain amount of awareness of the problem, but it  is\nonly  superficial.  The current viral defenses include  signature\nidentification, cyclic redundancy checks and intercept  verifica-\ntion,  but the new viruses can combat those as a matter of  rule.\nIf  the current rate of viral infection continues, it will  be  a\nsafe  bet that nearly every computer in the country will  be  in-\nfected ten times over within three years.\"\n\nDr. Arnold Sternman spent the next half hour answering insightful\nquestions  from  Nancy Deere, and even Puglasi  became  concerned\nenough  to  ask  a few.  Rickfield continued  with  his  visceral\ncomments to the constant amazement of the gallery and spectators.\nScott  could only imagine the raking Rickfield would  receive  in\nthe  press,  but  being Friday, the  effects  will  be  lessened.\nBesides, it seemed as if Rickfield just didn't give a damn.\n\nRickfield  dismissed and perfunctorily thanked Dr.  Sternman.  He\nprepared for the next speaker, but Senator Deere leaned over  and\nasked  him for a five minute conclave.  He was openly  reluctant,\nbut  as she raised her voice, he conceded.  In a  private  office\noff to the side, Nancy Deere came unglued.\n\n\"What  kind  of stunt are you pulling out there,  Senator?\"   She\ndemanded  as she paced the room.  \"I thought this was a  hearing,\nnot a lynching.\"\n\nRickfield slouched in a plush  leather chair and appeared  uncon-\ncerned.   \"I am indeed sorry,\" he said with the pronounced  drawl\nof a Southern country gentleman, \"that the young Senatoress finds\ncross examination unpleasant.  Perhaps if we treated this like  a\nneighborhood gossip session, it might be easier.\"\n\n\"Now one damned minute,\" she yelled while pointing a finger right\nat Rickfield.  \"That was not cross-examination; it was harassment\nand I for one am embarrassed for you.  And two, do not, I repeat,\ndo  not,  ever  patronize me.  I am not one of  your  cheap  call\ngirls.\"    She could not have knocked Rickfield over  any  harder\nwith a sledgehammer.\n\n\"You bitch!\"  Rickfield rose to confront her standing nine inches\ntaller.   \"You stupid bitch.  You have no idea what's  at  stake.\nNone.  It's bigger than you.  At this rate I can assure you,  you\nwill never have an ear in Washington.  Never.  You will be  deaf,\ndumb and blind in this town.  I have been on this Hill for thirty\nyears  and  paid my dues and I will not have a middle  aged  June\nCleaver undermine a lifetime of work just because she smells  her\nfirst cause.\"\n\nUndaunted, Nancy stood her ground.  \"I don't know what you're  up\nto  Senator, but I do know that you're sand bagging  these  hear-\nings.   I've  raised four kids and half a neighborhood,  plus  my\nhusband talked in his sleep.  I learned a lot about  politicians,\nand  I  know sand bagging when I see it.  Now, if you  got  stuck\nwith  these hearings and think they're a crock, that's  fine.   I\nhear it happens to everyone.  But, I see them as important and  I\ndon't want you to interfere.\"\n\n\"You are in no position to ask for anything.\"\n\n\"I'm not asking.  I'm telling.\"  Where did she get the  gumption,\nshe  asked  herself.   Then it occurred to her;<MI>   I'm  not  a\npolitician,  I  want to see things get fixed.<D>   \"I  will  take\nissue with you, take you on publicly, if necessary.  I was Presi-\ndent of the PTA for 8 years.  I am fluent in dealing with bitches\nof every size and shape.  You're just a bastard.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                    Chapter 21\n\n     Friday, January 8\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nAs the hour is late, I am tempted to call a recess until tomorrow\nmorning,\"   Senator Merrill Rickfield said congenially  from  the\ncenter  seat  of the hearing room dais.  His blow up  with  Nancy\nleft him in a rage, but he ably disguised the anger by  replacing\nit with overcompensated manners.\n\n\"However,\" he continued, \"I understand that we scheduled  someone\nto  speak  to us who has to catch a plane  back  to  California?\"\nRickfield  quickly glanced about the formal dais to espy  someone\nwho could help him fill in the details.  Ken Boyers was engrossed\nin  conversation and had to be prodded to respond.  \"Ken,\"  Rick-\nfield whispered while covering the microphone with his hand.   He\nleaned over and behind his seat.  \"Is that right, this True  Blue\nguy flew in for the day and he's out tonight?\"\n\nKen  nodded. \"Yes, it was the only way we could get him.\"\n\n\"What makes him so bloody important?\"  Rickfield acted edgy.\n\n\"He's one of the software industry's leading spokesman.  He  owns\ndGraph,\"   Ken  said, making it sound like he was in on a private\njoke.\n\n\"So  fucking what?  What's he doing here?\"   Rickfield  demanded.\nKeeping it to a whisper was hard.\n\n\"Industry  perspective.  We need to hear from all possible  view-\npoints in order to . . .\"  Ken  explained.\n\n\"Oh, all right.  Whatever.  If this  goes past five, have someone\ncall my wife and tell her I'll see her tomorrow.\"  Rickfield  sat\nback and smiled a politician-hiding-something smile.\n\n\"Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, a little scheduling  confusion.\nI guess there's a first time for anything.\"  Rickfield's  chuckle\ntold  those-in-the-know that it was time to laugh now.  If  Rick-\nfield saw someone not laughing at one of his arthritic jokes,  he\nwould remember.   Might cost a future favor, so it was simpler to\nlaugh.   The mild titter throughout the hall that  followed  gave\nRickfield the few seconds he needed to organize himself.\n\n\"Yes,  yes.  Page 239.  Everyone there?\"  Rickfield  scanned  the\nother  committee members and aides flipping pages frantically  to\nfind the proper place.\n\n\"We now have the pleasure of hearing from Pierre, now correct  me\nif I say this wrong, Trewww-Blow?\"  Rickfield looked up over  his\nglasses  to  see Pierre seated at the hearing  table.   \"Is  that\nright?\"  Scott had been able to keep his privileged location  for\nthe busier afternoon session by occupying several seats with  his\nbags  and  coat.  He figured correctly that he would be  able  to\nkeep  at least one as the room filled with more people  than  had\nbeen there for the morning session.\n\n\"Troubleaux, yes Senator. Very good.\"  Pierre had turned on  110%\ncharm.   Cameras  from the now busy press pool in  front  of  the\nhearing  tables strobe-lit the room until every photographer  had\nhis  first  quota of shots.  Troubleaux was  still  the  computer\nindustry's  Golden Boy; he could do no wrong. Watching the  reac-\ntion  to  Pierre's  mere presence,  Senator  Rickfield  instantly\nrealized  that  True Blue here was a public  relations  pro,  and\ncould be hard to control.  What was he gonna say anyway?   Indus-\ntry perspective my ass.  This hearing was as good as over  before\nit  started  until  the television people  showed  up,  Rickfield\nthought to himself with disgust.\n\n\"Mr. Trew-Blow flew in extra special for this today,\"   Rickfield\norated.  \"And I'm sure we are all anxious to hear what he has  to\nsay.\"   His Southern twang rang of boredom.  Scott, who was  sit-\nting  not  6  feet from where Pierre and  the  others  testified,\noverheard Troubleaux's attorney whisper, \"sarcastic bastard.\"\n\nRickfield  continued. \"He is here to give us an overview  of  the\nproblems that software manufacturers face.  So, unless anyone has\nany  comments  before Mr. Trew-Blow, I will ask him to  read  his\nopening statement.\"\n\n\"I  do,  Mr. Chairman,\"  Senator Nancy Deere said.  She  said  it\nwith enough oomph to come across more dynamic on the sound system\nthan  did  Rickfield.   Political  upstaging.   Rickfield  looked\nannoyed.  He had had enough of her today. One thing after  anoth-\ner, and all he wanted was to get through the hearings as fast  as\npossible, make a \"Take No Action\" recommendation to the Committee\nand retire after election day.  Mrs.  Deere was making that  goal\nincreasingly difficult to reach.\n\n\"I  recognize the Junior Senator.\"  He said the word 'Junior'  as\nif  it was scrawled on a men's room wall.  His point was lost  on\nnobody,  and privately, most would agree that it was a  tasteless\ntactic.\n\n\"Thank  you,  Mr.  Chairman,\" Senator Nancy  Deere  said  poising\nherself.   \"I, too,  feel indeed grateful, and honored,  to  have\nMr. Troubleaux here today.  His accomplishments over the last few\nyears,  legendary in some circles I understand, have been  in  no\nway inconsequential to the way that America does business. By  no\nmeans  do I wish  to embarrass Mr. Troubleaux, and I do  hope  he\nwill  forgive me.\"  Pierre gave Nancy a forgiving smile when  she\nglanced  at  him.   \"However, I do feel it  incumbent  upon  this\ncommittee to enter into the record the significant  contributions\nhe  has  made to the computer industry.  If there are  no  objec-\ntions, I have prepared a short biography.\"  No one objected.\n\n\"Mr.  Troubleaux, a native  Frenchman, came to the United  States\nat  age  12 to attend Julliard School of  Music  on  scholarship.\nSince  founding dGraph, Inc. with the late Max Jones, dGraph  and\nMr. Troubleaux have received constant accolades from the business\ncommunity,  the software industry and Wall Street.\"   It  sounded\nmore  to Scott that she was reading past achievements before  she\nhanded out a Grammy.\n\n\"Entrepreneur  of  the Year, 1984, 1985,  1986,  1988,  Cupertino\nChamber  of Commerce.  Entrepreneur Year of the Year,  California\nState  Trade  Association, 1987.  Technical  Achievement  of  the\nYear, IEEE, 1988 . . .\"\n\nSenator Deere read on about Pierre the Magnificent and the  house\nthat dGraph built.  If this was an election for sainthood, Pierre\nwould  be a shoo-in.  But considering the beating that  Rickfield\nhad  inflicted  on a couple of earlier speakers, it  looked  like\nNancy was trying to bolster Pierre for the upcoming onslaught.\n\n\".  . .and he has just been appointed to the President's  Council\non  Competitive Excellence.\"  She closed her folder.  \"With  that\nnumber  of  awards  and credentials, I dare say I  expect  to  be\ninundated with insights.  Thank you Mr. Chairman.\"\n\n\"And,  we thank you,\"  Rickfield barbed, \"for that  introduction.\nNow, if there are no further interruptions,\" he glared at  Nancy,\n\"Mr. Trew-Blow, would you care to read your prepared statement.\n\n\"No,  Senator,\"   Pierre came back.  A hush  descended  over  the\nentire  room.  He paused long enough to increase the  tension  in\nthe room to the breaking point.  \"I never use prepared notes.   I\nprefer  to  speak casually and honestly.  Do you  mind?\"   Pierre\nexaggerated  his French accent for effect. After years of  public\nappearances,  he knew how to work and win a crowd.   The  cameras\nagain  flashed as Pierre had just won the first round  of  verbal\ngymnastics.\n\n\"It is a bit unusual, not to have an advanced copy of your state-\nments, and then . . .\" Rickfield stopped himself in mid sentence.\n\"Never mind, I'm sorry.  Please, Mr. Trew-Blow, proceed.\"\n\n\"Thank  you,  Mr. Chairman.\" Pierre scanned the room to  see  how\nmuch of it he commanded.  How many people were actually listening\nto  what he was going to say, or were they there for the  experi-\nence and another line item on a resume?  This was his milieu.   A\nlive audience, and a TV audience as an extra added bonus.  But he\nhad planned it that way.\n\nHe  never told anyone that he was the one who called the TV  sta-\ntions to tell them that there would be a significant news  devel-\nopment  at  the Rickfield hearings.  If he  concentrated,  Pierre\ncould speak like a native American with a Midwest twang.  He gave\nCNN, NBC, CBS and ABC down home pitches on some of the dirt  that\nmight come out. Only CNN showed up.  They sent a junior producer.\nSo what, everyone has to start somewhere.  And this might be  his\nbig break.\n\n\"Mr.  Chairman, committee members,\" his eyes scanned the dais  as\nhe  spoke. \"Honored guests,\" he looked around the hall to  insure\nas many people present felt as important as possible, \"and inter-\nested  observers, I thank you for the opportunity to address  you\nhere today.\"  In seconds he owned the room.  Pierre was a  capti-\nvating  orator.  \"I must plead guilty to the overly kind  remarks\nby  Senator Deere, thank you very much.  But, I am  not  feigning\nhumility  when I must lavish similar praises upon the many  dedi-\ncated friends at dGraph, whom have made our successes possible.\"\n\nMutual  admiration society, thought Scott.  What a pile  of  D.C.\nhorseshit,  but this Pierre was playing the game better than  the\ncongressional  denizens.   As Pierre spoke, the  corners  of  his\nmouth twitched, ever so slightly, but just enough for the observ-\ner  to note that he took little of these  formalities  seriously.\nThe lone TV camera rolled.\n\n\"My  statement will be brief, Mr. Chairman, and I am  sure,  that\nafter it is complete you will have many questions,\" Pierre  said.\nHis tone was kind, the words ominous.\n\n\"I  am not a technical person, instead, I am a dreamer.  I  leave\nthe bits and bytes to the  wizards who can translate dreams  into\na reality.  Software designers are the alchemists who can in fact\nturn silicon into gold.  They skillfully navigate the development\nof  thoughts from the amorphous to the tangible.  Veritable  art-\nists, who like the painter, work from tabula rasa, a clean slate,\nand  have a picture in mind.  It is the efforts of tens of  thou-\nsands  of dedicated software pioneers who have pushed  the  fron-\ntiers  of technology to such a degree that an  entire  generation\nhas grown up in a society where software and digital  interaction\nare assimilated from birth.\n\n\"We have come to think, perhaps incorrectly, in a discreet  quan-\ntized,  digital if you will, framework.  To a certain  extent  we\nhave  lost  the ability to make a good  guess.\"   Pierre  paused.\n\"Think about a watch, with a second hand.  The analog type.  When\nasked for the time, a response might be 'about three-thirty',  or\n'it's  a quarter after ', or 'it's almost ten.'   We  approximate\nthe time.\n\n\"With  a  digital watch, one's response will  be  more  accurate;\n'one- twenty-three,\" or '4 minutes before twelve,' or 'it's  nine\nthirty-three.'   We  don't have to guess anymore.  And  that's  a\nshame.  When we lose the ability to make an educated guess,  take\na stab at, shoot from the hip, we cease using a valuable creative\ntool.  Imagination!\n\n\"By  depending  upon them so completely, we fall hostage  to  the\nmachines  of our creation; we maintain a constant  reliance  upon\ntheir  accuracy  and infallibility.  I am aware of  the  admitted\nparallel  to many science fiction stories where  the  scientists'\nmachines  take over the world.  Those tales are, thankfully,  the\nproducts  of  vivid imaginations.  The technology  does  not  yet\nexist  to worry about a renegade computer.  HAL-9000 series  com-\nputers  are still far in the future.  As long as we,  as  humans,\ntell  the computer to open the pod bay doors, the pod  bay  doors\nwill open.\"  Pierre elicited a respectful giggle from the  stand-\ning room only crowd, many of whom came solely to hear him  speak.\nRickfield doodled.\n\n\"Yet,  there is another viewpoint. It is few people, indeed,  who\ncan honestly claim to doubt the answer displayed on their  calcu-\nlator.  They have been with us for over 20 years and we  instinc-\ntively  trust  in  their reliability.  We  assume  the  computing\nmachine  to be flawless.  In many ways, theoretically it is  per-\nfect.  But when man gets involved he fouls it up. Our fingers are\ntoo  big  for the digital key pad on  our  wristwatch-calculator-\ntimer-TV.  Since  we can't approximate the answer, we  have  lost\nthat skill, we can't guess,  it becomes nearly impossible to know\nif we're getting the right answer.\n\n\"We  trust  our computers.  We believe it  when  our  spreadsheet\ntells  us  that  we will experience 50% annual  growth  for  five\nyears.  We believe the automatic bank teller that tells us we are\noverdrawn.   We don't question it.  We trust the computer at  the\nsupermarket.   As far as I know, only my mother adds up her  gro-\nceries by hand while still at the check-out counter.\"\n\nWhile  the image sank in for his audience, Pierre picked  up  the\nglass  of ice water in front of him and sipped enough to wet  his\nwhistle.  The crowd ate him up.  He was weaving a web, drawing  a\npicture, and only the artist knew what the climax would be.\n\n\"Excuse me.\" Pierre cleared his throat.  \"We as a people  believe\na  computer printout is the closest thing to God on  earth.   Di-\nvinely  accurate, piously error-free.  Computerized  bank  state-\nments, credit card reports, phone bills, our life is stored  away\nin computer memories, and we trust that the information  residing\nthere  is  accurate.  We want, we need to believe, that  the  ma-\nchines  that  switch  the street lights, the ones  that  run  the\nelevator,  the one that tells us we have to go to traffic  court,\nwe want to believe that they are right.\n\n\"Then  on yet another hand, we all experience the frustration  of\nthe omnipresent complaint, 'I'm sorry the computer is down.   Can\nyou call back?'\"  Again the audience emotionally related to  what\nPierre  was  saying.  They nodded at each other and  in  Pierre's\ndirection to indicate concurrence.\n\n\"I,  as  many  of us have I am sure, arrived at a  hotel,  or  an\nairport, or a car rental agency and been told that we don't  have\na  reservation.   For  me there is an  initial  embarrassment  of\nhaving  my hand slapped by the computer terminal via  the  clerk.\nThen,  I  react strongly.  I will raise my voice and say  that  I\nmade  a  reservation, two days ago.  I did it myself.   Then  the\nclerk will say something like, 'It's not in the computer'.    How\ndo you react to that statement?\n\n\"Suddenly your integrity is being questioned by an  agglomeration\nof  wire and silicon.  Your veracity comes into immediate  doubt.\nThe  clerk  might think that you never even made  a  reservation.\nYou  become a liar because the computer disagrees with you.   And\nto  argue  about  it is an exercise in  futility.   The  computer\ncannot  reason.  The computer has no ability to make  a  judgment\nabout you, or me.  It is a case of being totally black or  white.\nAnd for the human of the species, that value system is unfathoma-\nble, paradoxical.  Nothing is black and white.  Yes, the computer\nis  black and white.  Herein again, the mind prefers the  analog,\nthe continuous, rather than the digitally discreet.\n\n\"In these cases, the role is reversed, we blame the computer  for\nmaking errors.  We tend to be verbally graphic in the comments we\nmake  about computers when they don't appear to work the  way  we\nexpect  them  to.  We distrust them.\"  Pierre gestured  with  his\narms to emphasize his point.  The crescendo had begun.\n\n\"The  sociological  implications are incredible. As a  people  we\nhave  an  inherent  distrust of computers; they  become  an  easy\nscapegoat for modern irritations.  However, the balancing side of\nthe scale is an implicit trust in their abilities.  The  inherent\ntrust we maintain in computers is a deeply emotional one, much as\na helpless infant trusts the warmth of contact with his  parents.\nSuch  is the trust that we have in our computers,  because,  like\nthe baby, without that trust, we could not survive.\"\n\nHe  let the words sink in.  A low rumbling began  throughout  the\ngallery and hall.  Pierre couldn't hear any of the comments,  but\nhe was sure he was starting a stink.\n\n\"It  is our faith in computers that lets us continue.  The  reli-\ngious parallels are obvious. The evangelical computer is also the\nsubject  of fiction, but trust and faith are inextricably  meshed\ninto  flavors and degrees.  A brief sampling of  common  everyday\nitems  and  events that are dependent on  computers  might  prove\nenlightening.\n\n\"Without  computers, many of lifes' simple pleasures and  conven-\niences  would  disappear.  Cable television.   Movies  like  Star\nWars.  Special effects by computer.  Magic Money Cards.   Imagine\nlife  without them.\"  A nervous giggle met Pierre's social  slam.\n\"Call  holding.   Remember  dial phones?   No  computers  needed.\nCD's?   The  staple   diet of teenage America is  the  bread  and\nbutter  of the music industry.  Mail.  Let's not forget the  Post\nOffice  and  other shippers.  Without computers  Federal  Express\nwould  be no better than the Honest-We'll-Be-Here-Tomorrow  Cargo\nCompany.\"\n\n\"Oh,  and yes,\" Pierre said dramatically. \"Let's get rid  of  the\nmicrowave  ovens, the VCR's and video cameras. I think I've  made\nmy point.\"\n\n\"I wish you would, Mr. Trew-Blow,\"  Senator Rickfield caustically\ninterjected.   \"What  is  the point?\"  Rickfield  was  making  no\npoints taking on Pierre Troubleaux.  He was too popular.\n\n\"Thank  you,  Senator, I am glad you asked.  I was  just  getting\nthere.\"  Pierre's  sugary treatment was an  appropriate  slap  in\nRickfield's face.\n\n\"Please  continue.\"  The Senator had difficulty saying  the  word\n'please'.\n\n\"Yes sir.  So, the prognostications made over a decade ago by the\nlikes of Steve Jobs, that computers would alter the way we  play,\nwork  and think have been completely fulfilled.  Now, if we  look\nat  those years, we see a multi-billion dollar industry that  has\nmade extraordinary promises to the world of business.   Computer-\nize  they say!  Modernize! Get with the times!  Make your  opera-\ntion efficient!  Stay ahead of the competition!  And we  listened\nand we bought.\n\n\"With  a  projected  life cycle of between only  three  and  five\nyears, technology progresses that fast, once computerized, forev-\ner  computerized.  To keep up with the competitive Jones',  main-\ntaining  technical  advantages requires upgrading  to  subsequent\ngenerations  of computers.  The computer salespeople told  us  to\nrun our businesses on computers, send out Social Security  checks\nby computer, replace typewriters with word processors and bank at\nhome.   Yet,  somewhere in the heady days  of  phenomenal  growth\nduring  the early 1980's, someone forgot.  Someone, or more  than\nlikely  most of Silicon Valley forgot, that people  were  putting\ntheir  trust in these machines and we gave them no reason to.   I\ninclude myself and my firm among the guilty.\n\n\"Very  simply,  we have built a culture, an  economic  base,  the\nlargest  GNP in the world on a system of inter-connected  comput-\ners.  We have placed the wealths of our nations, the backbone  of\nthe  fabric of our way of life, we have placed our trust in  com-\nputers  that do not warrant that trust.  It is incredible  to  me\nthat  major financial institutions do not protect their  computer\nassets as well as they protect their cash on hand.\n\n\"I  find it unbelievable that the computers responsible  in  part\nfor  the defense of this country appear to have more  open  doors\nthan a thousand churches on Sunday.  It is incomprehensible to me\nthat privacy, one of the founding principles of this nation,  has\nbeen ignored during the information revolution.  The massive data\nbases  that contain vast amounts of personal data on us all  have\nbeen  amply shown to be not worthy of trust.  All it takes  is  a\nhome  computer  and elbow grease and you, or I,  or  he,\"  Pierre\npointed  at  various people seated around the room, \"can  have  a\nfield day and change anybody's life history.  What happens if the\ncomputer disagrees with you then?\n\n\"It  staggers  the  imagination that we have  not  attempted  any\ncoherent strategy to protect the lifeblood of our society.  That,\nladies and gentlemen is a crime.  We spend $3 trillion on weapons\nin  one decade, yet we do not have the foresight to  protect  our\ncomputers? It is a crime of indifference by business leaders.   A\ncrime  against common sense by Congress who passes laws and  then\nrefuses  to fund their enactment.  Staggeringly  idiotic.  Pardon\nme.\"   Pierre drained the water from his glass as the tension  in\nthe hearing room thickened.\n\n\"We live the paradox of simultaneously distrusting computers  and\nbeing  required  to trust them and live with them.   We  are  all\ncriminals in this disgrace.  Maybe dGraph more than most.  Permit\nme  to  explain  my involvement.\"  The electricity  in  the  room\ncrackled and the novice CNN producer instructed the cameraman  to\nget it right.\n\n\"Troubleaux!\"  A man's gruff accented voice elongated the  sylla-\nbles  as  he shouted from the balcony in the rear.   A  thousands\neyes  jerked  to the source of the sound  up  above.   Troubleaux\nhimself turned in his seat to see a middle aged dark man, wearing\na  turban,  pointing a handgun in his direction.  Scott  saw  the\nweapon and wondered which politician was the target.  Who was too\npro-Israel  this week?  He immediately thought of Rickfield.  No,\nhe didn't have a commitment either way.  He only rode the wave of\npopular sentiment.\n\nPierre  too,  wondered who was the target of a  madman's  suicide\nattack.  It had to be suicide, there was no escape.\n\nScott's mind raced through a thousand thoughts during that  first\ntenth  of a second, not the endless minutes he later  remembered.\nIn  the  next split second, Scott realized,  more  accurately  he\nknew, that Pierre was the target.  The would-be victim.\n\nAs the first report from the handgun echoed through the cavernous\nchamber  Scott was mid-leap at Pierre.  Hell of a way to grab  an\nexclusive,  he thought.  He fell into Pierre as the  second  shot\nexploded.  Scott painfully caught the edge of the chair with  his\nshoulder while pushing Pierre over sideways.  They crumpled  into\na heap on the floor when the third shot fired.\n\nScott  glanced up at the turbanned man vehemently mouthing  words\nto  an  invisible entity skyward. The din from the panic  in  the\nroom  made it impossible to hear.  Still brandishing the  pistol,\nthe  assailant  began  to take aim again, at  Scott  and  Pierre.\nScott attempted to wiggle free from the tangle of Pierre's  limbs\nand  the chairs around them.  He struggled to  extricate  himself\nbut found it impossible.\n\nA  fourth shot discharged. Scott cringed, awaiting the worst  but\ninstead  heard the bullet ricochet off a metal object above  him.\nScott's  adrenal relief was punctuated by a loud and heavy  sigh.\nHe  noticed  that the assailant's shooting arm had  been  knocked\nupwards  by a quick moving Capital policeman who violently  threw\nhimself  at  the turbanned man so hard that  they  both  careened\nforward to the edge of the balcony.  The policeman grabbed onto a\nbench  which  kept  him from plummeting twenty  feet  below.  His\ntarget  was hurtled over the edge and landed prone on two  wooden\nchairs which collapsed under the force.  The shooting stopped.\n\nScott groaned from discomfort and pain as he slowly began to pull\naway  from Pierre.  Then he noticed the blood.  A lot  of  blood.\nHe  looked down at himself to see that his white pullover  shirt,\nthe one with Mickey Mouse instead of an alligator over the breast\npocket, was wet with red.  As was his jacket.  His left hand  had\nbeen on the floor, in a pool of blood that was oozing out of  the\nback  of Pierre's head.  Scott tried to consciously  control  his\nphysical  revulsion to the body beneath him and the  overwhelming\nurge to regurgitate.\n\nThen  Pierre's  body moved.  His chest heaved heavily  and  Scott\npulled  himself  away completely.  Pierre had been  hit  with  at\nleast  two bullets, one exiting from the front of his  chest  and\none  stripping away a piece of skull exposing the  brain.   Grue-\nsome.\n\n\"He's alive! Get a doctor!\"  Scott shouted. He lifted himself  up\nto see over the tables.  The mad shuffle to the exits  continued.\nNo one seemed to pay attention.\n\n\"Hey!  Is there a doctor in the house?\"\n\nScott  looked down at Pierre and touched the veins in  his  neck.\nThey  were  pulsing, but not with all of  life's  vigor.   \"Hey,\"\nScott said quietly, \"you're gonna be all right.  We got a  doctor\ncoming.   Don't worry.  Just hang in there.\"  Scott lied, but  40\nyears of movies and television had preprogrammed the sentiments.\n\n\"Drtppheeough . . .\" Scott heard Pierre gurgle.\n\n\"What?  What did you say?\"  Scott leaned his ear down  closer  to\nPierre's mouth.\n\n\"DGOEROUGH.\"\n\n\"Take  it easy,\" Scott said to comfort the badly  injured  Pierre\nTroubleaux.\n\n\"Nooo  . . .\" Pierre's limp body made a futile attempt  at  move-\nment.  Scott held him back.\n\n\"Hey,  Pierre . . .you don't mind if I call you  Pierre?\"   Scott\nadapted a mock French accent.\n\n\"Noo, DNGRAAAAPHJG . . .\"\n\n\"Good.   Why don't you just lay back and wait.  The doctor'll  be\nhere in a second . . .\"\n\n\"Sick . . .\"  Pierre managed to get out one word.\n\n\"Sick?  Sick?  Yeah, yeah, you're sick,\"  Scott agreed sympathet-\nically.\n\n\"DGRAF, sick.\"  The effort caused Pierre to pant quickly.\n\n\"Dgraf, sick?  What does that mean?\"  Scott asked.\n\n\"Sick. DGraph sick.\"  Pierre's voice began to fade. \"Sick.  Don't\nuse it. Don't use . . .\"\n\n\"What  do you mean don't use it?  DGraph?  Hey!\"   Scott  lightly\nshook Pierre.  \"You still with us?  C'mon, what'd you say?   Tell\nme again?  Sick?\"\n\nPierre's body was still.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe bullshit put out by the Government was beyond belief, thought\nMiles.  How could they sit there and claim that all was well?  It\nwas  common knowledge that computer security was dismal  at  best\nthroughout  both  the civilian and military agencies.   With  the\nyears  he  spent  at NSA he knew that security  was  a  political\ncompromise and not a fiscal or technical reality.  And these guys\nlied  through their teeth.  Oh, well, he thought, that would  all\nchange soon.\n\nThe report issued by the National Research Council in November of\n1990  concurred with Miles' assessment.  Security in the  govern-\nment  was a disaster, a laughable travesty if it weren't for  the\ndanger  to national security.  The report castigated the  results\nof  decades of political in-fighting between  agencies  competing\nfor survival and power.\n\nHe  and Perky spent the day watching the hearings at Miles'  high\nrise apartment.  They had become an item in certain circles  that\nMiles traveled and now they spent a great deal of time  together.\nAfter  several  on-again  off-again attempts  at  a  relationship\nconsisting  of more than just sex,  they decided not to see  each\nother for over a year.  That was fine by Miles; he had missed the\nfreedom of no commitments.\n\nAt  an embassy Christmas party months later, they ran  into  each\nother and the old animal attraction between them was re-released.\nThey spent the weekend in bed letting their hormones loose to run\nrampant on each other.  The two had been inseparable since.   She\nwas  the first girl, woman, who was able to tolerate  Miles'  in-\nflated ego\u000fand his constant need for emotional gratification.\n\nPerky  had  little idea, by design, of the work  that  Miles  was\ndoing  for Homosoto.  She knew he was a computer  and  communica-\ntions  wizard,  but that was all.  Prying was  not  her  concern.\nDuring  his angry outbursts venting  frustration with  Homosoto's\npettiness,  Perky  supported him fully, unaware of  his  ultimate\ngoal.\n\nPerky found the testimony by Dr. Sternman to be educational;  she\nactually  began  to  understand some of  the  complicated  issues\nsurrounding security and privacy.  In many ways it was scary, she\ntold  Miles.  He agreed, saying if were up to him,  things  would\nget a lot worse before they get any better.  She responded to his\nominous  comment with silence until Pierre Troubleaux  began  his\ntestimony.\n\n\u000fAs  well  known  as Bill Gates, as charismatic  as  Steve  Jobs,\nPierre  Troubleaux  was  regarded as a sexy,  rich  and  eligible\nbachelor   ready  for  the taking.  Stephanie  Perkins  was  more\nstirred  by  his appearance and bearing than his  words,  so  she\njoined  Miles  in rapt attention to watch his  orations  on  live\ntelevision.\n\nWhen  the first shot rang out their stunned confusion echoed  the\ncamera's erratic framing.  As the second shot came across the TV,\nPerky  sprang up and shouted, \"No!\"  Tears dripped from the  cor-\nners of her eyes.\n\n\"Miles! What's happening?  They're shooting him . . .\"\n\n\"I  don't know .\"  A third shot and then the image of  Scott  and\nPierre crumbling.   \"Holy shit, it's an assassination!\"\n\n\"Miles, what's going on here?\"  Stephanie cried.\n\n\"This  is fucking nuts . . .he's killing him . . .\" Miles  stared\nat  the  screen and spoke in a dull monotone.  \"I  can't  believe\nthis is happening, it's not part of the plan . . .\"\n\n\"Miles,  Miles!\"   She screamed, desperately trying  to  get  his\nattention.  \"Who? Miles! Who's killing him?  What plan?\"\n\n\"Fucking Homosoto, that yellow skinned prick . . .\"\n\n\"Homosoto?\"  She stopped  upon hearing the name.\n\nMiles leapt up from the couch and raced over to the corner of the\nroom  with  his  computers.  He pounced on the  keyboard  of  the\nNipCom  computer and told it to dial Homosoto's number in  Japan.\nThat son of a bitch better be there.  Answer, damn it.\n\n     <<<<<<AUTOCRYPT CONVERSATION>>>>>>\n\nHomosoto!!!!!\n\nThe  delay seemed interminable as Miles waited for him to get  on\nline.  Perky followed him over to the computer and watched as  he\nmade contact.  She knew that Miles and Homosoto spoke often  over\nthe  computer,  too often for Miles' taste.  Homosoto  whined  to\nMiles  almost  every day, about one thing or another,  and  Miles\ncomplained to her about how irritating his childish  interference\nwas.  But throughout it all, Perky had never been privy to  their\nconversations.   She had stayed her distance, until this time.\n\nMiles had been in rages before; she had become unwillingly accus-\ntomed  to his furious outbursts.  Generally they  were  unfocused\neruptions; a sophomoric way of releasing pent up energy and frus-\ntration.  But this time, Miles' face clearly showed fear.  Steph-\nanie saw the dread.  \"Miles!  What does Homosoto have to do  with\nthis?  Miles, please!\"  She pleaded with him to include her.  The\nscreen finally responded.\n\nMR. FOSTER.  AN UNEXPECTED PLEASURE.\n\nYou imperial mother fucker.\n\nEXPLAINATION, PLEASE.\n\nYou're a fucking murderer.\n\nI TAKE EXCEPTION TO THAT.\n\nTake  exception  to this, Jack!  What the hell did you  kill  him\nfor?\n\nI ASSUME YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING TELEVISION.\n\nAren't we the Einstein of Sushi land.\n\nYOUR MANNERS.\n\nYou killed him! Why?\n\nStephanie  read the monitor and wept quietly as the  conversation\nscrolled before her.  She placed her hands on Miles' shoulders in\nan effort to feel less alone.\n\nIT  WAS  A NECESSARY EVIL.  HE COULD NOT BE PERMITTED  TO  SPEAK.\nNOT YET.\n\nSo you killed him?\n\nONE  OF MY PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE OVER ZEALOUS.  IT IS  REGRETTABLE,\nBUT NECESSARY.\n\nIt is not necessary to kill anyone.  Nowhere in the plan does  it\ncall for murder!  That was part of our deal.\n\nTHE WINDS BLOW.  CONDITIONS CHANGE.\n\nThe wind blows up your ass!\n\nTHAT  DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACT THAT HE WAS GOING TO TELL WHAT  HE\nKNEW.\n\nWhat the hell does he know?\n\nDGRAPH.  THAT'S THE PROGRAM WE INFECTED.\n\nDGraph?   That's impossible. That's the most popular  program  in\nthe world.  How did you infect it?\n\nI BOUGHT IT.\n\nYou own dGraph?  I thought that Data Tech owned them.\n\nOSO  OWNS DATA TECH.  YOU DID NOT LISTEN TO YOUR OWN  ADVICE.   I\nBOUGHT  IT AFTER YOU VISITED ME FOR THE SECOND TIME.   IT  SEEMED\nPRUDENT.   WE  ALSO BOUGHT A HALF DOZEN  OTHER  SMALL,  PROMISING\nSOFTWARE COMPANIES, JUST AS YOU SUGGESTED.  VERY GOOD PLAN.\n\nAnd Troubleaux knows?\n\nOF COURSE.  HE HAD INCENTIVE.\n\nSo you try to kill him?\n\nHE  LOST HIS INCENTIVE.  IT WAS NECESSARY.  HE WAS GOING TO  TELL\nAND, AS YOU SAID, SECRECY IS PARAMOUNT.  YOUR WORDS.\n\nYes, secrecy, but not murder.  I can't be part of that.\n\nBUT YOU ARE MR. FOSTER.  I HOPE THAT THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT\nTHAT WILL NOT BE REPEATED.\n\nIt had damn well better be.\n\nDO NOT FORGET MR. FOSTER THAT YOU HAVE A SIZABLE PAYMENT  COMING.\nI WOULD HATE TO SEE YOU LOSE THAT WHEN THINGS ARE SO CLOSE.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\n\"Son of a bitch,\" Miles said out loud.  \"Son of a bitch.\"\n\n\"What's  going on?  Miles?\" Perky followed him back to the  couch\nin  front of the TV and sat close with her arm around  him.   She\nwas still crying softly.\n\n\"It's gonna start. That's amazing.\"  He blankly stared forward.\n\n\"What's gonna start?  Miles, did you kill someone?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" He turned to her in sincerity.  \"That bastard  Homosoto\ndid.  Jesus, I can't believe it.\"\n\n\"What are you involved in? I thought you were a consultant.\"\n\n\"I was.  Tomorrow I will be a very rich retired consultant.\"   He\npulled her hands into his and spoke warmly.  \"Listen, it's better\nthat your don't know what's going on, much better.  But I promise\nyou,   I  promise  you, that Homosoto is behind it,  not  me.   I\ncouldn't ever kill anyone.  You need to believe that.\"\n\n\"Miles, I do, but you seem to know more than . . .\"\n\n\"I  do,  and  I can't say anything.  Trust me,\"  he  said  as  he\nbrought her close to him.  \"This will all work out for the  best.\nI promise you. Look at me,\" he said and pulled up her chin so she\ngazed  directly into his eyes.   \"I have a lot invested  in  you,\nand this project.  More than you could ever know, and now that it\nis  nearly  over, I can put more time into you.  After  all,  you\nbear  some of the responsibility.\"  Miles' loving attitude was  a\ncontradiction from his usual self centered pre-occupation.\n\n\"Me?\"  She asked.\n\n\"Who got me involved with Homosoto in the first place?\"  he  said\nglaring at her.\n\n\"I guess I did, but . . .\"\n\n\"I  know, I'm kidding,\" he said squeezing her closer.   \"I'm  not\nblaming  you  for  anything.  I didn't know he  could  resort  to\nmurder,  and if I did, I never would have gotten involved in  the\nfirst place.\"\n\n\"Miles,  I love you.\"  That was the first time in their years  of\non-again  off-again contact that she told him how she felt.   Now\nshe had to decide if she would tell him that he was just  another\nassignment, and that in all likelihood she had just lost her job,\ntoo.  \"I really do love you.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"The  last  goddamned time this happened was in the  1950's  when\nPuerto  Rican  revolutionaries started a shoot-em-up in  the  old\ngallery,\" the President shouted.\n\nPhil  Musgrave and Quinton Chambers listened to the angry  Presi-\ndent.    His tirade began minutes after he summoned them both  to\nhis office.   They were as frustrated and upset as he was, but it\nwas their job to listen until the President had blown off  enough\nsteam.\n\n\"I  am  well aware a democracy, a true democracy  is  subject  to\nextremist activists, but,\" the President sighed, \"this is getting\nentirely out of hand.  What is it about this computer stuff  that\nstirs up so much emotion?\"  He waited for an answer.\n\n\"I'm  not  sure  that computers are to blame,  sir,\"  said  Phil.\n\"First  of all, the assailant used a ceramic pistol.  No way  for\nour  security  to detect it without a physical  search  and  that\nwouldn't  go over well with anyone.\"  The brilliant Musgrave  was\nmaking  a  case  for calm rationality in the light  of  the  live\nassassination  attempt.  \"Second, at this point there is no  con-\nnection between Troubleaux and his attacker.  We're not even 100%\nsure that Troubleaux was the target.\"\n\n\"That's a crock Phil,\" asserted the President.  \"It doesn't  take\na  genius to figure out that there is an obvious  connection  be-\ntween  this computer crap and the Rickfield incident. I  want  to\nknow what it is, and I want to know fast.\"\n\n\"Sir,\"  Chambers  said  quietly.  \"We have the FBI  and  the  CIA\ninvestigating,  but until the perpetrator regains  consciousness,\nwhich may be doubtful because his spine was snapped in the  fall,\nwe won't know too much.\"\n\nThe President frowned.  \"Does it seem odd to you that Mason,  the\nTimes reporter was there with Troubleaux at the exact time he got\nshot?\"\n\n\"No  sir, just a coincidence.  It seems that computer  crime  has\nbeen his hot button for a while,\" Musgrave said.  \"I don't  think\nhe's involved at all.\"\n\n\"I'm  not suggesting that,\" the President interrupted.   \"But  he\ndoes seem to be where the action is.  I think it would be prudent\nif we knew a bit more of his activities.  Do I need to say more?\"\n\n\"No sir.  Consider it done.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                    Chapter 22\n\n     Friday, January 8\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nIt seemed that everyone in the world wanted to speak to Scott  at\nonce. The FBI spent an hour asking him inane questions.  \"Why did\nyou  help him?\"  \"Do you know Troubleaux?\"  \"Why were you at  the\nhearings?\"   \"Why  didn't you sit with the rest  of  the  press?\"\n\"Where's your camera?\"  \"Can we read your notes?\"\n\nScott  was cooperative, but he had his limits.  \"You're  the  one\nwho's been writing those computer stories, aren't you?\"   \"What's\nin this for you?\"\n\nScott  excused himself, not so politely. If you want me for  any-\nthing else, please contact the paper, he told the FBI agents  who\nhad learned nothing from anyone else either.\n\nHe  escaped  from other reporters who wanted his  reporter's  in-\nsight, thus learning what it was like to be hounded  relentlessly\nby  the  press.   Damned pain in the ass, he  thought,  and  damn\nstupid  questions.   \"How  did  you feel  .  .  .?\"    \"Were  you\nscared . . .?\"  \"Why did you . . .?\"\n\nThe  exhausted Scott found the only available solace in  a  third\nfloor  men's room stall where he wrote a piece for the  paper  on\nhis  GRiD laptop computer.  Nearly falling asleep on  the  toilet\nseat,  he temporarily refreshed himself with ice cold water  from\nthe tap and changed from his bloodsoaked clothes into fresh jeans\nand a pullover from his hanging bag that still burdoned him.  One\nreporter  from the Washington Post thought himself lucky to  have\nfound Scott in the men's room, but when Scott finished bombasting\nhim with his own verbal  assault, the shell shocked reporter left\nwell enough alone.\n\nAfter  the  Capital  police were through  questioning  Scott,  he\nwanted  to make a swift exit to the airport and get  home.   They\ndidn't  detain  him very long, realizing Scott  would  always  be\navailable.   Especially since this was news. His  pocket  shuttle\nschedule  showed there was a 6:30 flight to Westchester  Airport;\nhe  could then grab a limo home and be in bed by ten, that is  if\nthe exhaustion didn't take over somewhere along the way.\n\nThree  days in Europe on next to no sleep.  Rush back  to  public\nSenate  hearings  that no one has ever heard  about.   Television\ncameras  appear,  no one admits to calling the press,  and  then,\nPierre.  He needed time to think, alone.  Away from the conflict-\ning  influences that were tearing at him.\n\nOn one hand his paper expected him to report and investigate  the\nnews.   On another, Tyrone wanted help on his  investigation  be-\ncause  official  Washington had turned their backs on  him.   And\nSpook.  Spook.  Why is that so familiar? Then he had to be honest\nwith  his own feelings.  What about this story had so  captivated\nhim  that  he  had let many of his other assignments  go  by  the\nwayside?\n\nDoug  was pleased with Scott's progress, and after  today,  well,\nwhat  editor wouldn't be pleased to have a potential star  writer\non  the  National news.   But Scott was drowning  in  the  story.\nThere  were  too many pieces, from every  conceivable  direction,\nwith  none too many of them fitting neatly together.  He  thought\nof the ever determined  Hurcule Poirot, Agatha Christie's  detec-\ntive,  recalling  that the answers to a  puzzle  came  infinitely\neasier to the fictional sleuth than to him.\n\nScott called into Doug.\n\n\"Are you all right?\" Doug asked with concern but didn't wait  for\nan  answer.  \"I got your message.  Next time call me at home.   I\nthought you were going to be in Europe till Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Hold your horses,\" Scott said with agitation.  Doug shut up  and\nlistened to the distraught Scott.  \"I have the story all  written\nfor you.  Both of them are going into surgery and the Arab is  in\npretty bad shape.  The committee made itself scarce real fast and\nthere's no one else to talk to.  I've had to make a career out of\navoiding reporters.  Seems like I'm the only one left with  noth-\ning to say.\"  Doug heard the exhaustion in Scott's voice.\n\n\"Listen,\" Doug said with a supportive tone.  \"You've been doing a\nbang up job, but I'm sending Ben down there to cover the assassi-\nnation attempt.  I want you to go to bed for 24 hours and  that's\nan order.  I don't want to hear from you till Monday.\"\n\nScott  gratefully acknowledged Doug's edict, and might have  sug-\ngested  it himself if it weren't for his dedication to the  story\nhe had spent months on already.  \"O.K.,\" Scott agreed.  \"I  guess\nnot much will happen . . .\"\n\n\"That's  right.  I want you fresh anyway,\" Doug said with  vigor.\n\"If  anything  major comes up, I'll see that we call  you.   Fair\nenough?\"\n\nScott checked his watch as his cab got caught up in the slow late\nafternoon rush hour traffic on the George Washington Parkway.  If\nhe  missed this flight, he thought, there was another one  in  an\nhour.   The pandemonium of Friday afternoon National Airport  had\nbecome  legendary.  Despite extensive new  construction,  express\nservices and modernized terminals, the airport designers in their\ninfinite  wisdom had neglected in any way to improve the flow  of\nautomobile traffic in and out of the airport.\n\nAs they approached, Scott could see the American terminal several\nhundred  yards  away  from his cab.  They were  stuck  behind  an\ninterminable  line  of other taxis, limousines,  cars  and  mini-\nbusses that had been stacking for ten minutes.  Scott decided  to\nhike the last few yards and he paid the driver who tried to  talk\nhim into remaining till the ride was over.  Scott weaved  through\nthe standstill traffic jam until he saw the problem.  So typical.\nA stretch Mercedes 560, was blocking the only two lanes that were\npassable.  Worse yet, there was no one in the car.  No driver, no\npassengers.  Several airport police were discussing their options\nwhen a tall, slender black man, dressed in an impeccably tailored\nbrown suit came rushing from the terminal doors.\n\n\"Diplomatic  immunity!\" He called out with a  thick,  overbearing\nCambridge accent.\n\nThe  startled  policemen saw the man push several people  to  the\nside,  almost  knocking one elderly woman to the  ground.   Scott\nreached the Mercedes and stayed to watch the upcoming encounter\n\n\"I  said, Diplomatic immunity,\"  he said  authoritatively.   \"Put\nyour tickets away.\"\n\n\"Sir,  are you aware that your car has been blocking  other  cars\nfrom . . .\"\n\n\"Take it up with the Embassy,\" the man said as he roughly  opened\nthe driver's door. \"This car belongs to the Ambassador and he  is\nimmune from your laws.\"  He shut the door, revved the engine  and\npulled  out squealing his tires.  Several pedestrians had  to  be\nfleet of foot to miss being sideswiped.\n\n\"Fucking camel jockeys,\" said one younger policeman.\n\n\"He's from equatorial Africa, Einstein,\" said another.\n\n\"It's all the same to me.  Foreigners telling us how to live  our\nlives,\" the third policeman said angrily.\n\n\"You  know,  I can get 10 days for spitting on  the  ground,  but\nthese assholes can commit murder and be sent home a hero.  It's a\nfucking crime,\" the younger one agreed.\n\n\"O.K.,  guys, leave the politics to the thieves on Capital  Hill.\nLet's get this traffic moving,\" the senior policeman said as they\nstarted the process of untangling airport gridlock.\n\nAnother  day in the nation's capital, Scott thought.   A  melting\npot  that  echoed  the days of Ellis Island.  Scott  carried  his\nbriefcase,  laptop computer  and garment bag through the  crowded\nterminal  and made a left to the men's room next to the new  blue\nneon  bar.   Drinks were poured especially fast in  the  National\nAirport Bar.  Fliers were traveling on such tight schedules  that\nthey  had to run to the bar, grab two quick ones and dash to  the\ngate.  The new security regulations placed additional premiums on\ndrinking  time.  The bar accommodated their hurried  needs  well.\nScott  put down his baggage next to the luggage pile and stole  a\nbar  seat  from a patron rushing off to catch his  flight.    One\nhelluva chaotic day.  He ordered a beer, and sucked down half  of\nit  at  once.  The thirst quenching was  a  superior  experience.\nBrain dulling would take a little longer.\n\nThe clamorous rumble of the crowd and the television blaring from\nbehind  the  bar further anesthetized Scott's  racing  mind.   He\nfinally  found  himself engrossed in the  television,  blissfully\nignorant of all going on around him.  Scott became so absorbed in\nthe local news that he didn't notice the striking blonde sit next\nto  him.  She ordered  a white wine and made herself  comfortable\non the oversized stool.\n\nScott  turned to the bartender and asked for another beer  during\nthe  commercial.  It was then he noticed the gorgeous woman  next\nto him and her golden shoulder length hair.  Lightly tanned  skin\nwith  delicate crow's feet at the edges of her  penetrating  blue\neyes gave no indication of her age.  An old twenty to a  remarka-\nble forty five.  Stunning, he thought.  Absolutely stunning.   He\nshook  the thought off and returned his attention to the  televi-\nsion.\n\nHe  heard the announcer from Channel 4, the local NBC  affiliate.\n\"Topping  tonight's  stories, Shooting at Senate  Hearing.\"   The\npicture  changed from the anchorman to a live feed  from  outside\nthe  New  Senate  Office Building, where  Scott  had  just  been.\n\"Bringing it to us live is Shauna Miller.  Shauna?\"\n\n\"Thank  you  Bill,\"  she said looking straight  into  the  camera\nholding the microphone close to her chin.  Behind her was a  bevy\nof police and emergency vehicles and their personnel in a  flurry\nof activity.\n\n\"As  we first reported an hour ago, Pierre Troubleaux,  President\nof  dGraph, one of the nation's leading software  companies,  was\ncritically  injured  while giving testimony to  the  Privacy  and\nTechnology  Containment subcommittee.  At 3:15 Eastern  Time,  an\nunidentified assailant, using a 9mm Barretta, shot Mr. Troubleaux\nfour times, from the visitor's balcony which overlooks the  hear-\ning room.  Mr. Troubleaux was  answering questions about . . . \"\n\nScott's mind wandered back to the events of a few hours ago.   He\nstill  had  no idea why he did it.  The television  replayed  the\nportion of the video tape where Pierre was testifying.  While  he\nspoke,  the shots rang out and the camera image suddenly  blurred\nin search of the source of the sound.  Briefly the gunman is seen\nand  then the picture swings back to Pierre being pushed  out  of\nhis  chair by a man in a blue sports jacket and white shirt.   As\ntwo  more gun shots ring out the figure covers Pierre.  Two  more\nshots and the camera finally settles on Pierre Troubleaux  bleed-\ning profusely from the head, his eyes open and glazed.\n\nScott shuddered at the broadcast.  It captured the essence of the\nmoment, and the terror that he and the hundreds of others at  the\nhearing had experienced.  Shauna Miller reappeared.\n\n\"And  we  have here the man who dove to Mr.  Troubleaux's  rescue\nwhen the shooting began.\" The camera angle pulled back and showed\nScott standing next to the newswoman.\n\n\"This is Scott Mason, a reporter from the New York City Times who\nis  attending the hearings on behalf of his paper.   Scott,\"  she\nturned away from the camera to speak directly to Scott. \"How does\nit  feel being the news instead of reporting it?\"  She stuck  the\nmicrophone into his face.\n\n\"Uh,\"  Scott stammered.  What an assinine question,  he  thought.\n\"It  does  give me a different perspective,\" he said,  his  voice\nhollow.\n\n\"Yes,  I  would think so,\" Shauna added.  \"Can you tell  us  what\nhappened?\"\n\nMore  brilliance in broadcast journalism.  \"Sure, be  happy  to.\"\nScott  smiled at the camera.  \"One of the country's finest  soft-\nware executives just had part of his head blown off so his brains\ncould leak on my coat and the scumbag that shot him took a  sayo-\nnara  swan dive that broke every bone in his body.  How's  that?\"\nHe said devilishly.\n\n\"Uh,\" Shauna hesitated.  \"Very graphic.\"  This isn't Geraldo  she\nthought, just the local news.  \"Do you have anything to add?\"\n\n\"Yeah?  I got to get some sleep.\"\n\nThe  camera zoomed into a closeup of Shauna Miller.  \"Thank  you,\nMr. Mason.\"  She brightened up.  \"Mr. Troubleaux and the  alleged\ngunman  have been taken to Walter Reed Medical Center where  they\nare  undergoing surgery.  Both are listed in  critical  condition\nand  Mr.  Troubleaux is still in a coma.\"  Shauna droned  on  for\nanother 30 seconds with filler nonsense.  How did she ever get on\nthe air, Scott thought.  And, why does she remain?\n\n\"That was you.\"\n\nScott  started  at the female voice.  He turned to the  left  and\nonly  saw  salesmen  and male lobbyists  drinking  heartily.   He\npivoted  in the other direction and came face to face with  Sonja\nLindstrom.   \"Sorry?\"\n\n\"That  was you,\" she said widening her smile to expose a  perfect\nCrest ad.\n\nAn  electric  tingle ran up Scott's legs and through  his  torso.\nThe  pit of his stomach felt suddenly empty.  He gulped  silently\nand his face reddened.  \"What was me?\"\n\nShe  pointed  at the television.  \"That was you  at  the  hearing\ntoday, where Troubleaux got shot.\"\n\n\"Yeah, 'fraid so,\" he said.\n\n\"The  camera treats you well.  I was at the hearing, too,  but  I\njust figured out who you were.\"  Her earnest compliment came as a\nsurprise to Scott. He raised his eyebrows in bewilderment.\n\n\"Who I am?\"  He questioned.\n\n\"Oh,  sorry,\" she extended her hand to Scott.  \"I'm  Sonja  Lind-\nstrom.   I gather you're Scott Mason.\"  He gently took  her  hand\nand  a rush of electricity rippled up his arm till the  hairs  on\nthe back of his neck stood on end.\n\n\"Guilty  as charged,\" he responded.  He pointed his thumb at  the\ntelevision.  \"Great interview, huh?\"\n\n\"She epitomizes the stereotype of the dumb blond.\"  Sonja  turned\nher head slightly.  \"I hope you're not prejudiced?\"\n\n\"Prejudiced?\n\nShe  picked  up  her wine glass and  sipped  gingerly.   \"Against\nblondes.\"\n\n\"No, no. I was married to one,\"  he admitted.  \"But, I won't hold\nthat  against you.\"  Scott wasn't aggressive with women  and  his\nremark surprised even him.  Sonja laughed appreciatively.\n\n\"It  must have been rough,\" Sonja said empathetically.   \"I  mean\nthe blood and all.\"\n\n\"Not exactly my cup of tea.  I don't do the morgue shift.\"  Scott\nshuddered.  \"I'll stick to computers, not nearly so adventurous.\"\n\n\"And  hacker bashing.\" she said firmly.  She took another sip  of\nwine.\n\n\"How would you know that?\" Scott asked.\n\nShe turned and smiled at Scott.  \"You're famous.  You're known as\nthe  Hacker  Smacker by quite a few in the computer  field.   Not\neveryone  appreciates  what  you have to say.\"   Sonja,  ever  so\npolitely, challenged Scott.\n\n\"Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn,\" he smirked.\n\n\"That's  the  spirit,\" she encouraged.  \"Not that  I  agree  with\neverything you have to say.\"\n\n\"I assume you have read my drivel upon occasion.\"\n\n\"Upon occasion, yes,\" she said with a coy sweetness.\n\n\"So,  since you know so much about me, I stand at a clear  disad-\nvantage.  I only know you as Sonja.\"\n\n\"You're  right.  That's not fair at all.\"  She straightened  her-\nself  on the bar stool.  \"Sonja Lindstrom, dual citizenship  U.S.\nand  Denmark.  Born May 11, 1964, Copenhagen.  Moved here when  I\nwas two.  Studied political science at George Washington, minored\nin sociology.  Currently a public relations consultant to comput-\ner jocks.  I live in D.C. but I'm rarely here.\"\n\n\"Lucky for me,\" Scott ventured.\n\nSonja  didn't answer him as she slowly drained the bottom of  her\nwine  glass.  She glanced slyly at him, or was that his  imagina-\ntion?\n\n\"Can a girl buy a guy a drink?\"\n\nThe  clock said there was fifteen minutes before  Scott's  flight\ntook off.  No contest.\n\n\"I'd be honored,\" Scott said as he nodded his head in gratitude.\n\nSonja  Lindstrom bought the next two rounds and they talked.   No\nserious  talk, just carefree, sometimes meaningless  banter  that\nmade them laugh and relish the moment.   Scott didn't know he had\nmissed his second flight until it was time for the 8:15 plane  to\nLaGuardia.   It had been entirely too long. Longer than he  cared\nto remember since he had relaxed, disarmed himself near a  woman.\nThere was an inherent  distrust, fear of betrayal, that Scott had\nnot released, until now.\n\n\"So, about your wife,\" she asked after a lull in their  conversa-\ntion.\n\n\"My wife?\"  Scott shrank back.\n\n\"Humor me,\" she said.\n\n\"Nothing against her, it just didn't work out.\"\n\n\"What happened?\"  Sonja pursued.\n\n\"She was an artist, a sculptor.  And if I say so myself, an awful\none.  A three year old could do as well with stale Play-Dough.\"\n\n\"You're a critic, too?\"  Sonja bemused.\n\n\"Only  of  her art.  She got into the social scene in  New  York,\ngallery  openings,  the  she-she sect.  You know  what  I  mean?\"\nSonja  nodded. \"So, when I decided to make a career shift,  well,\nshe wasn't in complete agreement with me.  Even though in 8 years\nshe had never sold one single piece of art, she was convinced, by\nher  socialite pals, that her work was  extraordinarily  original\nand  would  become, without any doubt, the next Pet Rock  of  the\nelite.\"\n\n\"So?\"\n\n\"So,  she gets the bug to go to the Coast and make her  mark.   I\nthink  some  of her Park Avenue pals went to  Beverly  Hills  and\nwanted her to come out to be their entertainment. She expected me\nto follow her hallucinations, but I just couldn't play that part.\nShe's a little left of the Milky Way for me.\"\n\n\"How long has it been?\"  Sonja asked with warmth.\n\n\"Three years now.\"\n\n\"So, what have these years been like?\"\n\n\"Oh,  fine,\"  he said. Sonja gave him a disbelieving dirty  look.\n\"O.K., kinda lonely.  I'm not complaining, mind you, but when she\nwas there, no matter how inane our conversations were, not matter\nhow  far out in the stratosphere her mind was, at least  she  was\nsomeone to talk to, someone to come home to.  She's a sweet girl,\nI  loved  her, but she had needs that . . .well.  It  wasn't  all\nbad, we had a great few years.  I just couldn't let her  madness,\nharmless  though  it was, run my life.  We're still  friends,  we\ntalk fairly often.  I hope she becomes the next Dali.\"\n\n\"That's very gracious of you,\"  Sonja said sincerely.\n\n\"Not  really.  I really feel that way.  It's her life,  and,  she\nnever  wanted  or tried to hurt me.  She was just  following  her\nstar.\"\n\n\"Has she sold any of her art?\"  Sonja asked.\n\n\"It's on perpetual display, she says,\" Scott said.\n\n\"Why don't you buy one?  To make her feel good?\"\n\n\"Ha!   She feels fine.  Beverly Hills is not the worst  place  in\nthe  world  to be accepted.\"  He lost himself in  thought  for  a\nmoment.  \"I think it has worked out for both of us.\"\n\n\"Except, you're lonely,\" she came back.\n\n\"I got into my work.  A career shift at my age, you know, I had a\nlot to learn.  So, I've really put myself into the job, and  I've\nbeen  getting a lot out of it.\"  He stared at the gorgeous  woman\nto whom he had been telling his personal feelings.  \"But, yes,  I\ndo miss the companionship,\" he hinted.\n\nThe  clock over the bar announced it was quarter to  ten.  \"Hey.\"\nScott turned to face Sonja squarely. \"I gotta go, you don't  know\nhow  much I don't want to, but I gotta.\"  He spoke with a  pained\nsincerity.\n\n\"No you don't,\" she said exuberantly.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nSonja's  entire  face  glowed .  \"Have  you  ever  done  anything\ncrazy?\"\n\n\"Sure, of course,\" Scott nonchalantly said.\n\n\"No,  I mean really crazy.  Totally off the wall.   Spontaneous.\"\nShe  grabbed Scott's shoulders.  \"Haven't you ever wanted  to  go\noff  the deep end and not care what anybody thinks?\"  Scott  felt\nhimself  getting  captured by her exuberance.    This  absolutely\nstunning blonde bombshell exuded enough sexual enthusiasm for the\nentire NFL, and yet, he was playing it cool.  He wondered why.\n\n\"I was a real hell raiser as a kid . . .\"\n\n\"Listen, Scott.\" Her demeanor turned serious. \"Are you willing to\ndo something outrageous right now?  And go through with it?\"\n\nHere was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen  asking\nhim to make a borderline insane promise.  Her painted lips  broke\ninto a lush smile. Ten minutes to the last flight.\n\n\"I'm game.  What is it?\" Scott played along.  He could always say\nno.  Right?\n\n\"Wait  here a minute.\" Sonja grabbed her purse and dashed out  of\nthe bar.  Scott's eyes followed her in stunned amazement.\n\nScott  finished  his beer and the clock indicated that  the  last\nflight to New York had left.  He wondered what was keeping  Sonja\nso long, and then she suddenly whisked back into the bar.\n\n\"C'mon,  we have to hurry.\" Sonja shuffled papers in and  out  of\nher  purse.   She threw enough money on the bar  to  cover  their\ndrinks.\n\nScott scooted off of his bar stool laughing.  \"Hurry? Where're we\ngoing?\"\n\n\"Shhhh,  get  your bags,\" Sonja said urgently.  \"You  do  have  a\npassport don't you?\" She asked with concern.\n\n\"I  just  came from Europe, yeah.\"  His  bewilderment  was  clear\nwhile he retrieved his luggage.\n\n\"Good. Follow me.\"\n\nSonja  dashed  through the terminal to the  security  check  with\nScott  struggling to keep up.  The view of her  exquisite  figure\nwas noticed by more than just Scott, but she left him little time\nto relish the view.  She tossed her purse on the conveyor belt as\na  dazed Scott struggled with his own two bags.  She darted  from\nthe  security station leaving Mason to reorganize  himself.   His\nability to run was encumbered by his luggage so he watched  care-\nfully to see into which gate she was headed.\n\nGate, gate?  Where am I going? And why? He would have laughed  if\nhe wasn't out of breath from wind sprinting through the  airport.\nHe followed Sonja into Gate 3.\n\nShe handed a couple of tickets to the attendant.  \"We're the last\nones, hurry up, Mason,\" Sonja giggled.\n\n\"Where are we going . . .where did the tickets . . .how are you?\"\nScott stumbled through his thoughts.\n\n\"Just  get  on the plane.  We'll talk.\" She held  out  her  hand,\nbeckoning him seductively.\n\nThe  attractive flight attendant stared at Scott.  His  hesitancy\nwas holding up the flight. He looked at Sonja.  \"This is insane,\"\nhe said quietly.\n\n\"So it is.\"\n\n\"Where?  I mean where is this plane headed?\"\n\n\"Jamaica,\" she beamed.\n\n\"Oh,  Sonja,  come  on, this isn't real.\"  Why the  hell  was  he\ntrying to talk himself out of a fantasy in the making.\n\n\"I'm  getting on.  I need a weekend to cool out, and I  know  you\ndo.   After  what happened.\"  Sonja took the  separated  boarding\npass and looked back once before she left. Scott stood still.  He\nstared as Sonja disappeared down the tunnel to the plane.\n\nThe  flight attendant appeared quite annoyed.  \"Well, are you  or\naren't you?\"\n\nScott reasoned that if he reasoned out the pros and the cons  the\nplane  would be gone regardless of his decision.  \"Fuck  it,\"  he\nsaid and he walked briskly down the ramp.\n\nHe entered the Airbus behind the cockpit and turned right to find\nSonja.  It didn't take long.  She was the only person sitting  in\nfirst  class.   \"Fancy running into you here,\"  she  said  waving\nfrom the plush leather seat.\n\n\"Quite,\" he said in his well practiced West London accent.  \"Dare\nI  guess  how long it's been?\"  He placed his bags in  the  empty\nfirst class storage compartment.\n\n\"Too long.  Much too long. You had me worried,\" Sonja said  melo-\ndramatically.\n\n\"I still have me worried.\"\n\n\"I thought you might chicken out,\" she said.\n\n\"I still might.\"\n\nThe three hour flight was replete with champagne, brie and  simi-\nlar  delicacies.  They munched and sipped to their  heart's  con-\ntent.  One flight attendant, two passengers.  Light talk, innocu-\nous  flirtations, not so innocuous flirtations, more  chatting  -\ntime passed, hours disguised as seconds.\n\nHalf  Moon Bay is a one hour cab ride from the airport and,  true\nto  Jamaican hospitality, the hotel staff expected  them.    They\nwere led to two adjoining rooms after being served the obligatory\nwhite  rum  punch with a yellow umbrella.  It was  nearly  3  AM.\nScott was working on 60  hours with little or no sleep.\n\n\"Scott?\" Sonja asked as they prepared to go into their respective\nrooms.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For tomorrow night.\"\n\nAfter four hours sleep, Sonja knocked on Scott's door.  \"Rise and\nshine!  Beach time!\"\n\nScott  swore to himself, looked at the clock on the night  stand,\nand then swore again.  Ugh!  Scott forced himself out of bed  and\nopened the door.  The vision of Sonja Lindstrom in a bathing suit\nthat used no more than 4 square inches of material was  instantly\narousing.   Despite  39 plus years of  morning  aversions,  Scott\nreadied  himself  at breakneck speed, thinking that  reality  and\nfantasy were often inseparable.  The question was, what was this?\nWas  he really in the Caribbean? No!, he thought.  This is  real!\nHoly shit, this is real.  I wasn't as drunk as I thought. Intoxi-\ncation takes many forms, and this appears to be a delicious wine.\nDuring  breakfast she managed to talk him into going to the  nude\nbeach, about a half mile down Half Moon Bay.\n\n\"God,  you're uptight,\" she said as she shed her g-string on  the\nisolated  pristine  coastline.  She was a natural  blond  with  a\ndancer's body where the legs and buttocks merge into one.\n\n\"I am not!\"  He defended.\n\n\"I  bet  you  can't take them off.  For  personal  reasons,\"  she\nlaughed out loud pointing at the baggy swim suit he borrowed from\nthe  resort.  She lay down on her back, perfectly formed  breasts\npointing  at  the sky.  Scott noticed only the  faintest  of  tan\nlines several inches below her belly button.  She patted the huge\ntowel,  inviting  Scott to join her.  There was room  enough  for\nthree,\n\n\"Well,\"  he agreed.  \"It might prove embarrassing.  I thought  my\nintentions were honorable.\"\n\n\"Bull.   Neither are mine.\"  She arched her back and  patted  the\ntowel again.\n\n\"Fuck it,\" he said laughingly as he dropped his bathing suit  and\ndropped  quickly,  facedown  next to Sonja.   \"Ouch!\"  He  yelled\nlouder  than the hurt was worth.  \"I hate it when that  happens,\"\nhe said checking to make sure that the pieces were still intact.\n\nThey  spent the next two days exploring Half Moon Bay,  the  lush\ngreen hills behind the resort and each other.  Scott forgot about\nwork,  forgot about the hackers, forgot about Tyrone.   He  never\nthought about Kirk, Spook, or any of the blackmail schemes he was\nso  caught up in investigating.  And, he forgot, at least  tempo-\nrarily  about the incident with Pierre.  The world  consisted  of\nonly  two people, mutually radiating a glow flush  with  passion;\nretreating into each other so totally that no imaginable distrac-\ntion could disturb their urgings.\n\nThey slept no more than an hour all Saturday night, \"I told you I\nwanted to thank you for tomorrow night!\"  she said.  They made it\nto  the  water's  edge early Sunday morning.   Scott's  body  was\nredder in some places than it had ever been, and Sonja's tan line\nall but disappeared. They both knew that the fantasy was going to\nbe  over  in the morning, a 7:00 AM flight back to  reality,  but\nneither spoke of it.  The Here and Now was the only reality  that\nthey wanted to face.\n\n\"I'm  impressed,\" Sonja said turning to face Scott on  the  beach\ntowel.   No matter in which direction she turned, her body  stood\ntall and firm.\n\n\"Impressed, with what?\" Scott giggled.\n\n\"I had two days to loosen you up before you went back to that big\nbad city.  I'm ahead of schedule.\"\n\n\"What schedule?\"\n\n\"Scott, we need to talk.\"  Sonja reached over and touched Scott's\nshoulder.  He couldn't take his eyes off of her magnificent  nude\nfigure.   \"Did you ever work on something, for a very long  time;\nreally get yourself involved, dedicated, and then find out in was\nall for the wrong reasons?  That's how I feel now.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Saturday, January 10\n\nIt is not uncommon for the day employees at the CIA in Langley to\narrive at their desks before 6:00 AM.  Even on a Saturday. Today,\nMartin  Templer  arrived early to prepare for an  update  meeting\nwith the director.  Nothing special, just the weekly report.   He\nfound  that  he  could get  more done early in  the  morning.  He\nenjoyed  the time alone in his quiet office so he could  complete\nthe  report without constant interruption.  Not  fifteen  minutes\ninto his report, his phone rang.  Damn, he thought, it's starting\nalready.\n\n\"Yeah?\" Templer said gruffly into the mouthpiece.\n\n\"Martin?\"\n\n\"Yeah, who's this?\"\n\n\"Alex.\"\n\nTempler  had almost forgotten about their meeting.   \"Will  small\nwonders never cease.  Where have you been?\"\n\n\"Still  in Europe. I've been looking for some answers as we  dis-\ncussed.\"\n\n\"Great! What have you got?\"  Templer grabbed a legal pad.\n\n\"Nothing,\"  Alex said with finality.  \"Nothing.  Nobody knows  of\nany such operation, not even a hint.\"  Alex had mastered the  art\nof  lying twenty years ago.  \"But I'll tell you,\" he  added,   \"I\nthink that you may be on to something.\"\n\n\"If  there's nothing, how can there be something?\"  asked  Martin\nTempler.\n\nThis  was  Alex's opportunity to throw the CIA  further  off  the\ntrack.  Since he and Martin were friends, as much  as is possible\nin  this line of work, Alex counted on being believed,  at  least\nfor  a while.  \"Everybody denies any activity and that in  itself\nis unusual.  Even if nothing is happening, enough of the snitches\non  the  street will claim to be involved to  bolster  their  own\ncredibility.   However,  my friend, I doubt a handful  even  know\nabout your radiation, but it has gotten a lot of people thinking.\nI  get the feeling that if they didn't know about your  problems,\nthey will soon enough.  I wish I could be of further help, but it\nwas all dead ends.\"\n\n\"I  understand. It happens; besides it was a long  shot,\"  Martin\nsighed.  \"Do me a favor, and keep your eyes and ears open.\"\n\n\"I will, and this one is on the house,\" said Alex.\n\nAfter  he hung up something struck Martin as terribly wrong.   In\ntwenty years Alex had never, ever, done anything for free.  Being\na true mercenary, it wasn't in his character to offer  assistance\nto  anyone without sufficient motivation, and that  meant  money.\nMartin  noted the event, and reminded himself to include that  in\nhis report to the Director.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe television coverage of the Senate hearings left Taki Homosoto\nwith radically different emotions.

Radios  as well as anti-skid braking controls  and  all\nother  computer  controlled functions in the  automobiles  ceased\nworking.\n\nTo  date,  no deaths have been attributed to the  car's  epidemic\nfailures.\n\nDue  to the notoriety and questions regarding the safety  of  the\ncars, sales of Taurus's have plummeted by almost 80%.  Unlike the\nsimilar  Audi  situation where the alleged problem was  found  in\nonly  a few isolated cases, the Taurus failures have  been  wide-\nspread and catastrophically sudden.\n\nAccording  to  Ford,  \"There has never been a  problem  with  the\nTaurus  electronics' system.  We are examining all  possibilities\nin determining the real cause of the apparant failures.\"\n\nWhat else can Ford say?\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Chrysler Struck by Ford Failures\n     by Scott Mason\n\nChrysler  cars and mini-vans have been experiencing sudden  elec-\ntrical malfunctions . . .\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Mercedes Electrical Systems Follow Ford\n     by Scott Mason\n\nMercedes  owners have already organized a legal entity  to  force\nthe  manufacturer to find answers as to why so many Mercedes  are\nhaving sudden electrical failures.  Following in the footsteps of\nFord  and Chrysler, this is the first time that Mercedes has  not\nissued  an  immediate  'Fix' to its dealer.   Three  deaths  were\nreported when . . .\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Sunday January 10\n     National Security Agency\n\n\"What do you make of this Mason piece?\"\n\n\"I'd  like to know where the hell he gets his information,\"  said\nthe aide.  \"That's what I make of it.\"\n\n\"Someone's obviously leaking it to him,\" Marvin Jacobs,  Director\nof the National Security Agency, said to his senior aid.   \"Some-\none with access to a great deal of sensitive data.\"  The  disdain\nin his voice was unmistakable.\n\nEven  though it was Sunday, it was not unusual for him to  be  at\nhis office.  His more private endeavors could be more  discreetly\npursued.   A three decade career at the Agency had culminated  in\nhis  appointment to the Directorship, a position he had eyed  for\nyears.\n\n\"We  have  specialists who use HERF technology,\" the  aide  said.\n\"It's more or less a highly focused computer-gun.  An RF field on\nthe  order of 200 volts per meter is sufficient to  destroy  most\nelectrical  circuits.   Literally blow them up  from  the  inside\nout.\"\n\n\"Spare me the details.\"\n\n\"Sir,  we can stop a car from a thousand yards by pointing  elec-\ntricity at  it.\"\n\n\"I don't really care about the details.\"\n\n\"You should, sir. There's a point to this . . .\"\n\n\"Well, get on with it.\"  Jacobs was clearly annoyed.\n\n\"Unlike  the EMP-T technology which is very expensive and on  the\nabsolute edge of our capabilities . . .\"\n\n\"And someone elses . . .\"\n\n\"Granted,\"  the aide said, sounding irritated with  the  constant\ninterruptions.  \"But HERF can be generated cheaply by anyone with\nan  elementary  knowledge of electronics.   The  government  even\nsells surplus radio equipment that will do the job quite nicely.\"\n\nJacobs smiled briefly.\n\n\"You look pleased,\" the aide said with surprise.\n\nJacobs hid his pleasure behind a more serious countenance.   \"Oh,\nno,  it's just the irony of it all.  We've been warning them  for\nyears and now it's happening.\"\n\n\"Who, sir?\"\n\n\"Never  mind,\"  Jacobs said, dismissing the thought  momentarily.\n\"Go on.\"\n\nJacobs arrogantly leaned back in his executive chair, closed  his\neyes  and folded his hands over his barrel chest.  This  was  his\nway of telling subordinates to talk, spill their guts.\n\n\"The  real worry about cheap HERF is what it can do in the  wrong\nhands.\"   The  aide  obliged the ritual.   \"One  transmitter  and\nantenna  in  a small truck can wipe out every  computer  on  main\nstreet during a leisurely drive.  Cash registers, electric  type-\nwriters, alarms, phones, traffic lights . . .anything  electronic\na HERF is pointed at, Poof! Good as dead.  What if someone used a\nHERF gun at an airport, pointing up?  Or at the tower? From up to\na distance of over a kilometer, too.  Ten kilometers with  better\nequipment.\"\n\n\"So  it  works,\" muttered Jacobs so softly under his  breath  his\naide didn't hear.\n\n\"It's  reminiscent of drive-by shootings by organized crime.   In\nthis case, though, the target is slightly different.\"\n\n\"I  see.\"   Jacobs  kept his eyes closed as  the  aide  patiently\nwaited  for his boss to say something or allow him to  return  to\nhis family.  \"I gather we use similar tools ourselves?\"\n\n\"Yessir.  Very popular technique. Better kept quiet.\"\n\n\"Not any more.  Not any more.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 23\n\n     Monday, January 11\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nI  don't  think you're gonna be pleased,\" Phil Musgrave  said  at\ntheir  early  morning conclave, before the President's  busy  day\nbegan.\n\n\"What else is new?\" asked the President acerbically.  \"Why should\nI  have an easy today any more than any other day?\"  His dry  wit\noften  escaped  much of the White House staff, but  Musgrave  had\nbeen exposed to it for over 20 years and took it in stride.  Pre-\ncoffee grumps.  The President poured himself more hot decaf  from\nthe silver service.  \"What is it?\"\n\n\"Computers.\"\n\nThe  President  groaned.  \"Don't you ever long for the  old  days\nwhen  a calculator consisted of two pieces of sliding wood  or  a\nhundred beads on rods?\"\n\nMusgrave ignored his boss's frustration. \"Over the weekend,  sir,\nwe  experienced  a number of incidents that could  be  considered\nnon-random in nature,\" Musgrave said cautiously.\n\n\"In English, Phil,\" insisted the President.\n\n\"MILNET has been compromised.  The Optimus Data Base at  Pentagon\nhas  been erased as has been Anniston, Air Force Systems  Command\nand a dozen other computers tied through ARPANET.\"\n\nThe President sighed. \"Damage report?\"\n\n\"About  a  month.   We didn't lose anything  too  sensitive,  but\nthat's not the embarrassing part.\"\n\n\"If that's not, then what is?\"\n\n\"The  IRS computers tied to Treasury over the  Consolidated  Data\nNetwork?\"   The  President indicated to continue.   \"The  Central\nCollection Services computer for the Dallas District has had over\n100,000 records erased.  Gone.\"\n\n\"And?\"  The President said wearily.\n\n\"The IRS has had poor backup procedures.  The OMB and GAO reports\nof  1989 and 1990 detailed their operational shortcomings.\"   The\nPresident  waited for Phil to say something he could  relate  to.\n\"It  appears that we'll lose between $500 million and $2  Billion\nin revenues.\"\n\n\"Christ! That's it!\"  The President shouted.  \"Enough is  enough.\nThe  two weeks is up as of this moment.\"  He shook his head  with\nhis   eyes   closed  in  disbelief.  \"How  the  hell   can   this\nhappen . . .?\" he asked rhetorically.\n\n\"Sir, I think that our priority is to keep this out of the press.\nWe need plausible deniability . . .\"\n\n\"Stop  with the Pentagon-speak bullshit and just clamp down.   No\nleaks.   I want this contained.   The last damn thing we need  is\nfor  the public to think that we can't protect our own  computers\nand the privacy of our citizens.  If there is one single leak,  I\nwill  personally  behead the offender,\" the President  said  with\nintensity enough to let Phil know that his old friend and comrade\nmeant what he said.\n\n\"Issue  an  internal directive, lay down the  rules.   Who  knows\nabout this?\"\n\n\"Too many people, sir.  I am not convinced that we can keep  this\ncompletely out of the public eye.\"\n\n\"Isolate them.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"You  heard  me.  Isolate them.  National  Security.   Tell  them\nit'll  only  be  few days.  Christ.  Make up any damn  story  you\nwant, but have it taken care of.

They tore  themselves  apart\nfrom  each other, she tearfully, at  National Airport where  they\nhad met.   He would be back in a few days, once the hearings were\nrescheduled.  In the meantime, Scott wanted to go home and crash.\nWhile  being in Jamaica with Sonja was as exhilarating as  a  man\ncould want, relaxing and stimulating at once, he still was  going\non next to no rest.\n\nWhile the plane was still on the tarmac in Washington, Scott  had\nfallen fast asleep.  On the descent into New York, he half  awak-\nened,  to a hypnagogic state.  Scott had learned over  the  years\nhow  to  take advantage of such semi-conscious  conditions.   The\nmind seemingly floated in a place between reality and  conjecture\n-  where all possibilities are tangible, unencumbered by  earthly\nconcerns.   The drone of the jet engines, even  their  occasional\nrevving,   enhanced  the  mental  pleasure   Scott   experienced.\nThoughts  weightlessly drifted into and out of his head, some  of\nthem  common and benign and others surprisingly original, if  not\nout and out weird.\n\nIn  such a state, the conscious mind becomes the observer of  the\nactivities  of  the  unconscious mind.  The ego  of  Scott  Mason\nrestrained itself from interfering with the sublime mental  proc-\nesses  that bordered on the realm of pure creativity.   The  germ\nof  a  thought, the inchoate  idea, had the luxury  of  exploring\nitself  in  an infinity of possibilities and the  conscious  mind\nstood on the sidelines.  The blissful experience was in  constant\njeopardy  of  being relegated to a weak memory,  for  any  sudden\ndisturbance  could  instantly cause the subconscious  to  retreat\nback  into  a merger with the conscious mind.   Thus,  he  highly\nvalued these spontaneous meditations.\n\nBits and pieces of the last few days wove themselves into complex\npatterns  that reflected the confusion he felt.  He continued  to\ngaze  on and observe as the series of mental events that  had  no\nobvious  relationships assumed coherency and meaning.   When  one\ndoes not hold fixed preconceived notions, when one has the abili-\nty to change perspective, then, in these moments, the  possibili-\nties multiply.  Scott watched himself with the hackers in Amster-\ndam, with Kirk and Tyrone at home;  he watched himself both  live\nand die with Pierre in Washington.  Then the weekend, did it just\nend?   The unbelievable weekend with Sonja.  It was when  he  re-\nlived  the sexual intensity on the Half Moon Bay beach,  in  what\nwas  becoming an increasingly erotic   state, that his  mind  en-\ntered an  extraordinary bliss.\n\nThe rear tires of the plane hitting the runway was enough to snap\nScott  back to a  sober reality.  But he had the thought  and  he\nremembered it.\n\nScott  hired a stretch limousine at LaGuardia and slept  all  the\nway  to  Scarsdale, but lacking the good sense God gave  him,  he\nchecked  the messages on his phone machine.  Doug called to  find\nout if Scott still worked for the paper and Ty called requesting,\nalmost pleading, that Scott call as soon as he got back.  He  had\nto see him, post haste.\n\nThe  call  to Doug was simple.  Yes, I'm back.  The  hackers  are\nreal.  They  are a threat.  Pierre is still alive,  I  have  more\nmaterial than we can use.  I did take notes, and my butt is  sun-\nburned.  If there's nothing else, I'm dead on my feet and I  will\nsee you in the morning. Click.\n\nNow  he  wanted to talk to Tyrone as much as it sounded  like  Ty\nwanted  to speak to him.  Where was he? Probably at  the  office.\nHe dialed quickly. Tyrone answered with equal speed.\n\n\"Are you back?\" Ty asked excitedly.\n\n\"Yeah, just got in.  I need to talk to you . . .\"\n\n\"Not as much as we do, buddy.  Where are you now?\"\n\n\"Home.  Why?\"\n\n\"I'll  see  you  in an hour.  Wait there.\"  The FBI  man  was  in\ncontrol.   Where the hell else am I going to go, Scott thought.\n\nScott  piddled around, making piles for his maid,  unpacking  and\nputtering  around the kitchen.  Everything in the  fridge  needed\ncooking, and there was not enough energy for that, so he  decided\nto take a shower.  That might give him a few more hours before he\ncollapsed.\n\nExactly  one hour later, as promised, Tyrone Duncan rang  Scott's\ndoorbell.   They  exchanged a few pleasantries and  then  plunged\ninto  intense  information exchange.  They grabbed  a  couple  of\nbeers  and  sat  opposite each other  in  overstuffed  chairs  by\nScott's wide fireplace.\n\n\"Boy have I learned a lot . . .\"  said Scott.\n\n\"I think you may be right,\" said Tyrone.\n\n\"Of course I am.  I did learn a lot,\" Scott said with a  confused\nlook on his face.\n\n\"No I mean about what you said.\"\n\n\"I  haven't  said anything yet.  I think there's  a  conspiracy.\"\nScott winced to himself as he said the one word that was the bane\nof many a reporter.\n\n\"I said I think you were right.  And are right.\"\n\n\"What the devil are you talking about?\"  Scott was more  confused\nthen ever.\n\n\"Remember a few months back, on the train we were talking.\"\n\n\"Of  course we were talking.\"  Scott recognized the humor in  the\nconversation.\n\n\"No! I mean we were . . .shit. Shut up and listen or I'll  arrest\nyou!\"\n\n\"On what charge?\"\n\n\"CRS.\"\n\n\"CRS?\"\n\n\"Yeah, Can't Remember Shit. Shut up!\"\n\nScott  leaned back in his chair sipping away.  He had  gotten  to\nTy.  Hooked him, reeled him in and watched him flop on the  deck.\nIt  pissed Ty off to no end to allow himself to be suckered  into\nScott's occasional inanity.\n\n\"When this whole blackmail thing started up there was no apparent\nmotivation,\" Tyrone began.  \"One day you said that the motivation\nmight  be  a disruption of normal police and FBI  operations.   I\nthink  you might be right.  It's looking more and more  that  the\nblackmail stuff was a diversion.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so now?\" Scott asked.\n\n\"We  had  a ton of cases in the last few weeks, same  victims  as\nbefore, who were being called again, but this time with  demands.\nThey were being asked to cough up a lot of cash in a short  time,\nand stash it in a very public place.  We had dozens of stakeouts,\nwatching the drop points for a pick up.  It read like the  little\nbastards  were  finally getting greedy.  You know what  I  mean?\"\nScott nodded in agreement, thinking, where is this going?\n\n\"So  we had a couple hundred agents tied up waiting for  the  bad\nguys  to  show up.  And you know what?  No one showed.   No  one,\ndamn  it. There must have been fifty million in cash  sitting  in\nbus terminals, train stations, health clubs, you name it, and  no\none  comes to get any  of it?  There's something wrong with  that\npicture.\"\n\n\"And you think it's a cover?  Right?\"  Scott grinned wide.   \"For\nwhat?\"\n\nTy  shrank back in mild sublimation. \"Well,\" he began,  \"that  is\none  small piece of the puzzle I haven't filled in yet.   But,  I\nthought  you might be able to help with that.\"   Tyrone  Duncan's\neyes met Scott's and said, I am asking as a friend as well as  an\nagent.  Come on, we both win on this one.\n\n\"Stop  begging, Ty. It doesn't befit a member of the  President's\npolice force,\" Scott teased.  \"Of course I was going to tell you.\nYou're  gonna  read about it soon enough, and I  know,\"  he  said\nhalf-seriously, \"you won't screw me again.\"\n\nOuch,  thought Tyrone.  Why not pour in the salt while you're  at\nit.  \"I wouldn't worry.  No one thinks there's a problem.  I keep\nshouting and being ignored.  It's infinitely more prudent in  the\ngovernment to fuck-up by non-action than by taking a position and\nacting upon it.  I'm on a solo.\"\n\n\"Good enough,\" Scott assured Ty.  \"'Nother beer?\"  It felt  good.\nThey were back - friends again.\n\n\"Yeah,  It's six o'clock somewhere,\" Tyrone sighed.   \"So  what's\nyour news?\"\n\n\"You know I went over to this Hacker's Conference . . .\"\n\n\"In Amsterdam.\" added Tyrone.\n\n\"Right,  and I saw some toys that you can't believe,\" Scott  said\nintently.   \"The term Hacker should be replaced with Dr.  Hacker.\nThese  guys are incredible.  To them there is no such thing as  a\nlocked door.  They can get into and screw around with any comput-\ner they want.\"\n\n\"Nothing new there,\" said Ty.\n\n\"Bullshit. They're organized.  These characters make up an entire\nunderground society, that admittedly has few rules, but it's  the\nmost coherent bunch of anarchists I ever saw.\"\n\n\"What of it?\"\n\n\"Remember that van, the one that blew up and.\"\n\n\"How can I forget.\"\n\n\"And then my Tempest article.\"\n\n\"Yeah.  I know, I'm sorry,\" Tyrone said sincerely.\n\n\"Fuck  it.   It's over.  Wasn't your fault.  Anyway,  I  saw  the\nequipment  in actual use.  I saw them read computers with  anten-\nnas.   It  was  absolutely incredible.  It's  not  bullshit.   It\nreally works.\"  Scott spoke excitedly.\n\n\"You say it's Tempest?\"\n\n\"No,  anti-Tempest.  These guys have got it  down.    Regardless,\nthe stuff works.\"\n\n\"So what?  It works.\"\n\n\"So,  let's  say, if the hackers use these computer  monitors  to\nfind out all sorts of dirt on companies,\"  Scott slowly explained\nas he organized his thoughts.  \"Then they issue demands and cause\nall sorts of havoc and paranoia.  They ask for money.  Then  they\ndon't  come to collect it.  So what have they  achieved?\"   Scott\nasked rhetorically.\n\n\"They  tied up one shit load of a lot of police time,  I'll  tell\nyou that.\"\n\n\"Exactly.  Why?\"\n\n\"Diversion.  That's where we started,\" Ty said.\n\n\"But who is the diversion for?\"\n\nThe light bulb went off in Tyrone's head.  \"The hackers!\"\n\n\"Right,\"  agreed  Scott.  \"They're the ones who are going  to  do\nwhatever  it  is that the diversion is covering.  Did  that  make\nsense?\"\n\n\"No,\"  laughed Ty, \"but I got it.  Why would the hackers have  to\nbe covering for themselves.  Couldn't they be working for someone\nelse?\"\n\n\"I doubt it. This is one independent bunch of characters,\"  Scott\naffirmed.  \"Besides, there's more.  What happened in D.C. . . .\"\n\n\"Troubleaux,\" interrupted Ty.\n\n\"Bingo.  And there's something else, too.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I've  been  hearing about a computer system called  the  Freedom\nLeague.   Nothing specific, just that everything about it  sounds\ntoo good to be true.\"\n\n\"It usually is.\"\n\n\"And  one other thing.  If there is some sort of hacker  plot,  I\nthink I know someone who's involved.\"\n\n\"Did he admit anything?\"\n\n\"No, nothing.  But, well, we'll see.\"  Scott hesitated and  stut-\ntered.  \"Troubleaux, he said something to me.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" Ty said with disbelief.  \"I thought his brains  were\nleaking out.\"\n\n\"Thanks for reminding me; I had to buy a new wardrobe.\"\n\n\"And a tan?  Where've you been?\"\n\n\"With, well,\" Scott blushed, \"that's another story.\"\n\n\"O.K.,  Romeo,  how  did he talk?  What did he  say?\"   Ty  asked\ndoubtfully.\n\n\"He told me that dGraph was sick.\"\n\n\"Who's dGraph?\"\n\n\"dGraph,\"  laughed Scott, \"is how your secretary keeps your  life\norganized.  It's the most popular piece of software in the world.\nTroubleaux  founded  the  company.  And I think I  know  what  he\nmeant.\"\n\n\"He's a nerdy whiz kid, huh?\" joked Tyrone\n\n\"Just  the  opposite.  Mongo sex appeal to the ladies.   No,  his\npartner  was the . \"  Scott stopped mid sentence.  \"Hey,  I  just\nremembered  something.  Troubleaux had a partner, he founded  the\ncompany with him.  A couple of days before they went public,  his\npartner  died.  Shook up the industry.  Shortly  thereafter  Data\nTech bought them.\"\n\n\"And you think there's a connection?\"\n\n\"Maybe,  ah...I can't remember exactly,\" Scott said.   \"Hey,  you\ncan find out.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Your computers.\"\n\n\"They're at the office.\"\n\nScott pointed to his computer and Tyrone shook his head  violent-\nly.  \"I don't know how to. \"\n\n\"Ty,\" Scott said calmly.  \"Call your secretary.  Ask her for  the\nnumber and your passwords.\"  Scott persuaded Ty to be humble  and\ndial  his office.  He was actually able to guide Ty  through  the\nprocess  of accessing one of the largest collections of  informa-\ntion in the world.\n\n\"How  did you know we could do that?\" Ty asked after they  logged\ninto the FBI computer from Scott's study.\n\n\"Good guess.  I figured you guys couldn't function without remote\naccess.  Lucky.\"\n\nTyrone  scowled kiddingly at Scott. \"You going over to the  other\nside boy?  You seem to know an awful lot.\"\n\n\"That's  how  easy this stuff is. Anyone can do it.   In  fact  I\nheard  a  story about octogenarian hackers who  work  from  their\nnursing homes.  I guess it replaces sex.\"\n\n\"Bullshit,\" Tyrone said pointing at his chest.  \"This is one dude\nwho's knows the real thing. No placebos for me!\"\n\nThey  both laughed.  \"You know how to take it from  here?\"  asked\nScott once a main menu appeared.\n\n\"Yeah, let me at it.  What the hell did you want to know anyway?\"\n\n\"I  imagine you have a file on dGraph, somewhere inside the  over\n400,000,000 active files maintained at the FBI.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to worry about you.  That's classified . . .\"\n\n\"It's  all in the company you keep,\" Scott chided.  \"Just ask  it\nfor dGraph.\"  Tyrone selected an Inquiry Data Base and asked  the\ncomputer for what it knew about dGraph.  In a few seconds, a sub-\nmenu  appeared  entitled \"dGraph, Inc.\".  Under the  heading  ap-\npeared several options:\n\n     1. Company History\n     2. Financial Records\n     3. Products and Services\n     4. Management\n     5. Stock Holders\n     6. Activities\n     7. Legal\n     8. Comments\n\n\"Not bad!\" chided Scott.  \"Got that on everyone?\"\n\nTyrone  glared at Scott.  \"You shouldn't even know  this  exists.\nHey, do me a favor, will ya? When I have to lie later, at least I\nwant  to  be able to say you weren't staring over  my  shoulders.\nDig?\"\n\n\"No  problem,\" Scott said as he pounced on the couch in front  of\nthe  desk.  He knocked a few days of mail onto the floor to  make\nroom.  \"O.K., who founded the company?\"\n\n\"Founded 1984, Pierre Troubleaux and Max Jones . . .\"\n\n\"That's it!\" exclaimed Scott.  \"Max Jones.  Where?\"\n\n\"Cupertino, California.\"\n\n\"What date did they go public?\" Scott asked quickly.\n\n\"Ah, August 6, 1987.  Anything else massah?\" Tyrone gibed.\n\n\"Can you tie into the California Highway Patrol computers?\"\n\n\"What if I could?\"\n\n\"Well, if you could, I thought it would be interesting to take  a\nlook  at the police reports.  Because, as I remember,  there  was\nsomething  funny  about Max Jones,\"  Scott said, and  then  added\nmockingly, \"but that's only if you have access to the same infor-\nmation  that anyone can get for $2. It's all  public  information\nanyway.\"\n\n\"You know I'm not supposed to be doing this,\"  Tyrone said as  he\npecked at the keyboard.\n\n\"Bullshit. You do it all the time.\"\n\n\"Not  as  a public service.\"  The screen darkened  and  then  an-\nnounced that Tyrone had been given access to the CHiP  computers.\n\"So suppose I could do that, I suppose you'd want a copy of it.\"\n\n\"Only if the switch on the right side of the printer is turned ON\nand  if  the  paper  is straight.   Otherwise,  I  just  wouldn't\nbother.\"  Scott stared at the ceiling while the dot matrix print-\ner sang a high pitched song as the head traveled back and forth.\n\nTyrone  scanned the print out coming from the computers in  Cali-\nfornia.  \"You have one fuckuva memory.  Sheee-it.\"  Scott sat  up\nquickly.\n\n\"What, what does it say?\" Scott pressured.\n\n\"It  appears that your friend Max Jones was killed in an  automo-\nbile  accident  on Highway 275 at 12:30 AM.\"  Ty  stopped  for  a\nmoment  to  read more.  \"He was found, dead, at the bottom  of  a\nravine where his car landed after crashing through the  barriers.\nPretty high speed.  And, the brake lines were cut.\"\n\n\"Holy  shit,\" Scott said rising from his chair. \"Does two a  pat-\ntern make?\"\n\n\"You mean Troubleaux and Max?\" asked Tyrone.\n\n\"Yeah, they'll do.\"\n\n\"In  my mind it would warrant further investigation.\"  He made  a\nmental note.\n\n\"Anything else there?\" Scott asked.\n\n\"This  is the kicker,\" Ty added.  \"The investigation  lasted  two\ndays.  Upstairs told the department to make it a quick and clean,\nopen and shut case of accident.\"\n\n\"I  assume  no one from dGraph had any reason to doubt  what  the\npolice told them.  It sounds perfectly rational.\"\n\n\"Why  should they if nobody kicked up a stink?\" Ty said  to  him-\nself.   \"Hey,\"  he said to Scott.  \"You think  he  was  murdered,\ndon't you?\"\n\n\"You  bet your ass I do,\" Scott affirmed.  \"Think about it.   The\ntwo  founders of a company the size of dGraph, they're huge,  one\ndead  from a suspicious accident, and the other the target of  an\nassassination and in deep shit in the hospital.\"\n\n\"And it was the hackers, right?\"  laughed Tyrone.\n\n\"Maybe,\" Scott said seriously.  \"Why not?  It's all tying togeth-\ner.\"\n\n\"There's no proof,\" Tyrone said.\n\n\"No,  and  I  don't need it yet.  But  I  sense  the  connection.\nThat's  why  I  said there's a conspiracy.\"  He  used  that  word\nagain.\n\n\"And who is behind it and why? Pray tell?\"  Tyrone needled Scott.\n\"Nothing's   even   happened,   and   you're   already   spouting\nconspiracy.\"\n\n\"I  need to do something.  Two things.\"  Scott spoke  firmly  but\nvacantly.  \"I  need to talk to Kirk.  I think  there's  something\nwrong with dGraph, and he can help.\"\n\n\"And two?\"\n\n\"I'd like to know who I saw in Amsterdam.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Ty asked.\n\n\"Because . . .because, he's got something to do with  . .  .what-\never it is.  He as much as admitted it.\"\n\n\"I think I can help with that one,\" offered Ty.\n\n\"Huh?\"  Scott looked surprised.\n\n\"How about we go into my office and see who this guy is?\"  Tyrone\nenjoyed the moment.  One upping Scott.  \"Tomorrow.\"\n\nScott  decided  that  the fastest way to reach  Kirk,  he  really\nneeded Kirk, was to write a clue in an article.  Scott dialed the\npaper's  computer  from his house and opened a  file.  He  hadn't\nplanned on writing today - God, how long have I been awake?  This\nwas  the easiest way to contact Kirk now, but that was  going  to\nchange.   Tyrone  left early enough for Scott to  write  a  quick\npiece that would be sure to make an inside page, page 12 or 14.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Tuesday, January 12\n\n     The Computer As Weapon?\n     by Scott Mason\n\nSince the dawn of civilization, Man has had the perverse  ability\nto turn Good into Bad, White into Black, Hot into Cold, Life into\nDeath.   History  bears out that technology is falling  into  the\nsame trap.  The bow and arrow, the gun; they were created to help\nman  survive  the elements and feed himself.  Today  millions  of\nguns are bought with no purpose other than to hurt another  human\nbeing.   The  space program was going to send man to  the  stars;\ninstead we have Star Wars.  The great advantages that  technology\nhas  brought  modern  man have been  continuously  subverted  for\nmalevolent uses.\n\nWhat if the same is true for computers?\n\nOnly yesterday, in order to spy on my neighbor, or my opponent, I\nwould hire a private eye to perform the surveillance.  And  there\nwas  a constant danger of his being caught.  Today?  I'd hire  me\nthe  best computer hacker I could get my hands on and sic him  on\nthe targets of my interest.  Through their computers.\n\nFor  argument's  sake, let's say I want  advance  information  on\ncompanies  so I can play the stock market.  I have my hacker  get\ninside the SEC computers, (he can get in from literally thousands\nof locations nationwide) and read up on the latest figures before\nthey're  reported to the public.  Think of betting the whole  wad\non a race with only one horse.\n\nI would imagine, and I am no lawyer, that if I broke into the SEC\noffices  and  read through their file cabinets, I would be  in  a\nmighty poke of trouble.  But catching me in their computer is  an\nextraordinary  exercise  in  resource  frustration,  and  usually\nfutile.   For unlike the burglar, the computer criminal is  never\nat the scene of the crime.  He is ten or a hundred or a  thousand\nmiles  away.   Besides, the better computer  criminals  know  the\nsystems  they  attack so well, that they can cover  their  tracks\ncompletely; no one will ever know they were an uninvited guest.\n\nIsn't then the computer a tool, a weapon, of the computer  crimi-\nnal?  I can use my computer as a tool to pry open your  computer,\nand  then once inside I use it to perhaps destroy pieces of  your\ncomputer or your information.\n\nI  wonder  then about other computer crimes, and I  will  include\nviruses  in  that  category.  Is the computer or  the  virus  the\nweapon?   Is  the virus a special kind of computer  bullet?   The\nintent and the result is the same.\n\nI  recall hearing an articulate man recently make the  case  that\ncomputers  should  be licensed, and that not everyone  should  be\nable  to own one.  He maintained that the use of a computer  car-\nried  with  it an inherent social responsibility.   What  if  the\ntechnology that gives us the world's highest standard of  living,\nconvenience and luxury was used instead as a means of disruption;\na technological civil disobedience if you will?  What  if politi-\ncal  strength came from the corruption of an opponent's  computer\nsystems?  Are we not dealing with a weapon as much as a gun is  a\nweapon? my friend pleaded.\n\nClearly  the computer is Friend.  And the computer, by itself  is\nnot bad, but recent events have clearly demonstrated that it  can\nbe  used  for sinister and illegal purposes.  It is  the  use  to\nwhich  one  puts the tool that determines its  effectiveness  for\neither good or bad.  Any licensing of computers, information sys-\ntems, would be morally abhorrent - a veritable decimation of  the\nBill of Rights.  But I must recognize that the history of  indus-\ntrialized  society does not support my case.\n\nAutomobiles were once not licensed.  Do we want it any other way?\nI  am sure many of you wish that drivers licenses were harder  to\ncome by.  Radio transmitters have been licensed for most of  this\ncentury  and  many a civil libertarian will make  the  case  that\nbecause  they are licensed, it is a restriction on my freedom  of\nspeech  to require approval by the Government  before  broadcast.\nOn the practical side, does it make sense for ten radio  stations\nall trying to use the same frequency?\n\nCellular  phones are officially licensed as are CB's.   Guns  re-\nquire  licenses in an increasing number of states.  So  it  might\nappear  logical  to say that computers be  licensed,  to  prevent\nwhatever overcrowding calamity may unsuspectingly befall us.  The\ncompany  phone effectively licenses lines to you, with the  added\ndistinction of being able to record everything you do.\n\nComputers  represent an obvious boon and a potential bane.   When\ncomputers  are  turned against themselves, under the  control  of\nhumans  of course, or against the contents of the computer  under\nattack,  the results can ripple far and wide.  I believe  we  are\nindeed fortunate that computers have not yet been turned  against\ntheir  creators by faction groups vying for power and  attention.\nThus far isolated events, caused by ego or accident have been the\nrule and large scale coordinated, well executed computer assaults\nnon-existent.\n\nThat, though, is certainly no guarantee that we will not have  to\nface the Computer Terrorists tomorrow.\n\nThis is Scott Mason searching the Galaxy at Warp 9.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Tuesday, January 12\n     Federal Square, New York\n\nTyrone was required to come to the lobby of the FBI headquarters,\nsign Scott in and escort him through the building.  Scott  didn't\narrive until almost eleven; he let himself sleep in, in the hopes\nof  making up for lost sleep.  He knew it didn't work  that  way,\nbut twelve hours of dead rest had to do something.\n\nTyrone explained as they took an elevator two levels beneath  the\nstreet that they were going to work with a reconstructionist.   A\nman  with  a very powerful computer will build up the  face  that\nScott  saw, piece by piece.  They opened a door that was  identi-\nfied  by only a number and entered an almost sterile work  place.\nA  pair of Sun workstations with large high  resolution  monitors\nsat  on  large white tables by one wall, with a row of  racks  of\nfloor to ceiling disk drives and tape units opposite.\n\n\"Remember,\" Tyrone cautioned, \"no names.\"\n\n\"Right,\" said Scott.  \"No names.\"\n\nTyrone  introduced Scott to Vinnie who would be running the  com-\nputer.   Vinnie's  first job was to familiarize  Scott  with  the\nprocedure.   Tyrone  told Vinnie to call him in his  office  when\nthey  had  something;\u000fhe had other matters to attend  to  in  the\nmeantime.    Of  obvious Italian descent, with a  thick  Brooklyn\naccent,  Vinnie  Misselli epitomized the local boy  making  good.\nHis  lantern jaw and classic Roman good looks were out  of  place\namong the blue suits and white shirts that typified the FBI.\n\n\"All I need,\" Vinnie said, \"is a brief description to get  things\nstarted.  Then, we'll fix it piece by piece.\"\n\nScott  loosely described the Spook.  Dark hair, good looking,  no\nnoticeable  marks  and  of course, the dimples.   The  face  that\nVinnie built was generic. No unique features, just a nose and the\nother  parts that anatomically make up a face.  Scott  shook  his\nhead, no that's not even close.  Vinnie seemed undaunted.\n\n\"O.K., now, I am going to stretch the head, the overall shape and\nyou  tell me where to stop. All right?\"  Vinnie asked,  beginning\nhis manipulation before Scott answered.\n\n\"Sure,\" said Scott.  Vinnie rolled a large track ball built  into\nthe  keyboard  and  the head on the screen  slowly  stretched  in\nheight  and  width.  The changes didn't help Scott  much  he  but\nasked Vinnie to stop at one point anyway.\n\n\"Don't worry, we can change it later again.  How about the eyes?\"\n\n\"Two,\" said Scott seriously.\n\nVinnie gave Scott an ersatz dirty look. \"Everyone does it,\"  said\nVinnie.  \"Once.\"  He grinned at Scott.\n\n\"The eye brows, they were bushier,\" said Scott.\n\n\"Good.   Tell  me when.\"  The eyebrows on the  face  twisted  and\nturned  as  Vinnie moved the trackball with his  right  hand  and\nclicked at the keyboard with his left.\n\n\"That's  close,\" Scott said.  \"Yeah, hold it.\"  Vinnie froze  the\nimage  where  Scott  indicated  and they went  on  to  the  hair.\n\"Longer, wavier, less of a part . . .\"\n\nThey  worked  for an hour, Vinnie at the  computer  controls  and\nScott changing every imaginable feature on the face as it evolved\ninto  one  with  character.  Vinnie sat back  in  his  chair  and\nstretched.  \"How's that,\" he asked Scott.\n\nScott  hesitated.  He felt that he was making too  many  changes.\nMaybe this was as close as it got.  \"It's good,\" he said  without\nconviction.  There was a slight resemblance.\n\n\"That's  what  they all say,\" Vinnie said. \"It's not  even  close\nyet.\"   He laughed as Scott looked shocked.  \"All we've  done  so\nfar is get the general outline.  Now, we work on the details.\"\n\nFor  another  two  hours Scott commented on  the  subtle  changes\nVinnie  made to the face.  Nuances that one never thinks of;  the\ncurve  of the cheek, the half dozen angles of the chin, the  hun-\ndreds of ear lobes, eyes of a thousand shapes - they went through\nthem all and the face took form.  Scott saw the face take on  the\nappearance  of  the Spook; more and more it became  the  familiar\nface he had spent hours with a few days ago.\n\nAs he got caught up in the building and discovery process,  Scott\nissued commands to Vinnie; thicken the upper lip, just a  little.\nHigher  forehead.  He blurted out change after change and  Vinnie\nexecuted  every  one.  Actually, Vinnie preferred  it  this  way,\nbeing given the orders.  After all, he hadn't seen the face.\n\n\"There! That's the Spook!\" exclaimed Scott suddenly.\n\n\"You  sure?\"  asked  Vinnie sitting back in  the  plush  computer\nchair.\n\n\"Yup,\" Scott said with assurance.  \"That's him.\"\n\n\"O.K.,  let's see what we can do  . . .\" Vinnie rapidly typed  at\nthe keyboard and the picture of the face disappeared.  The screen\nwent  blank  for a few seconds until it was replaced  with  a   3\ndimensional  color model of a head.  The back of the head  turned\nand the visage of the Spook stared at them both.  It was an eerie\nfeeling  and  Scott  shuddered as the  disembodied  head  stopped\nspinning.\n\n\"Take a look at this,\" Vinnie said as he continued typing.  Scott\nwatched  the head, Spook's head, come alive.  The lips were  mov-\ning,  as  though it, he, was trying to speak.  \"I can give  it  a\nvoice if you'd like.\"\n\n\"Will that help?\" Scott asked.\n\n\"Nah, not in this case,\" Vinnie said,\"but it is fun.  Let's  make\nsure  that we got the right guy here.  We'll take a look  at  him\nfrom  every angle.\"  The head moved to the side for a  left  pro-\nfile.  \"I'll make a couple of gross adjustments, and you tell  me\nif it gets any better.\"\n\nThey  went  through  another hour of fine tuning  the  3-D  head,\nmodifying  skin tones, texture, hair style and a score  of  other\nsubtleties.   When they were done Scott remarked that  the  image\nlooked more like the Spook than the Spook himself.    Incredible.\nScott was truly impressed.  This is where taxpayer's money  went.\nVinnie called Tyrone and by the time he arrived, the color photo-\ngraphs and digital maps of the images were ready.\n\nScott followed Tyrone down one corridor, then another, through  a\ncommon area, and down a couple more hallways.  They entered  Room\n322B.  The innocuous appearance of the door did not prepare Scott\nfor what he saw; a huge computer room, at least a football  field\nin  length.   Blue and tan and beige and a few black metal  cabi-\nnets that housed hundreds of disparate yet co-existing computers.\nConsoles with great arrays of switches, row upon row of video and\ngraphic  displays  as  far as the eye could  see.   Thousands  of\nwhite two by two foot square panel floors hid miles of wires  and\ncables  that interconnected the maze of computers in  the  under-\nground control center.  There appeared to be a number of discreet\nareas,  where large computer consoles were centered amidst  racks\nof  tape or disk drives which served as the only  separation  be-\ntween workers.\n\n\"This is Big Floyd,\" Tyrone said proudly.  \"Or at least one  part\nof him.\"\n\n\"Who or what is Big Floyd?\"\n\n\"Big Floyd is a huge national computer system, tied together over\nthe Secure Automated Message Network.  This is the most  powerful\ncomputer facility outside of the NSA.\"\n\nQuiet conversations punctuated the hum of the disk drives and the\nclicks  of solenoids switching and the printers pushing reams  of\npaper.  The  muted voices could not be understood but  they  rang\nwith purpose.   The room had an almost reverent character to  it;\nwhere  speaking too loud would surely be considered  blasphemous.\nScott  and  Tyrone walked through banks and banks  of  equipment,\nmore computer equipment than Scott had ever seen in one location.\nIn  fact the Federal Square computer center is on the  pioneering\nedge  of forensic technology. The NSA computers might  have  more\noomph!, but the FBI computers have more purpose.\n\nTyrone stopped at one control console and asked if they could  do\na   match,  stat.  Of course, anything for  Mr.  Duncan.  \"RHIP,\"\nTyrone  said.  Scott recognized the acronym, Rank Has Its  Privi-\nlege.   Tyrone gave the computer operator the pictures and  asked\nhim to explain the process to Scott.\n\n\"I take these pictures and put them in the computer with a  scan-\nner.  The digitized images are stored here,\" he said pointing  at\na  a  rack of equipment. \"Then, we enter  the  subject's  general\ndescription.  Height, physique and so on.\"  He copied the  infor-\nmation into the computer.\n\n\"Now we ask the computer to find possible matches.\"\n\n\"You  mean the computer has photos of everyone in  there?\"  Scott\nasked incredulously.\n\n\"No,  Scott.  Just the bad guys, and people with security  clear-\nances,  and public officials?  Your Aunt Tillie is safe from  Big\nBrother's prying eyes.\"  The reason for Ty's sarcasm was clear to\nScott.   Tyrone was not exactly acting in an official capacity on\nthis part of the investigation.\n\n\"How many do you have? Pictures that is?\" Scott asked more diplo-\nmatically.\n\n\"That's classified,\" Tyrone said quickly.\n\n\"The hackers say you have files on over a hundred million people.\nIs that true?\"  Scott asked.  Tyrone glared at him, as if to say,\nshut  the  fuck  up.   Scott took the non-verbal  hint  and  they\nwatched in silence as the computer whirred searching for  similar\nphoto  files in its massive memory.  Within a couple  of  minutes\nthe computer said that there were 4 possible matches.  At the end\nof the 10 minute search, it was up to 16  candidates.\n\n\"We'll  do  a visual instead of a second search,\"  said  the  man\nbehind  the keyboard.  \"We'll start with the 90% matches.   There\nare  two of them.\"  A large monitor flashed with a picture  of  a\nman, that while not unlike the Spook in features, was  definitely\nnot him.  The picture was a high quality color photograph.\n\n\"No,  not him,\" Scott said without pause.  The computer  operator\nhit a couple of keys, a second picture flashed on the monitor and\nScott's face lit up.   \"That's him! That's the Spook!\"\n\nTyrone  had wondered if they would find any matches.   While  the\nFBI  data  base  was probably the largest in the  world,  it  was\nunlikely  that  there  was a comprehensive library  of  teen  age\nhackers.  \"Are you sure?\" Tyrone emphasized the word, 'sure'.\n\n\"Positive, yes.  That's him.\"\n\n\"Let's  have a quick look at the others before we do a  full  re-\ntrieve,\" said the computer operator.  Tyrone agreed and  fourteen\nother pictures of men with similar facial characteristics to  the\nSpook  appeared  on the screen, all receiving a quick  'no'  from\nScott.  Spook's picture as brought up again and again Scott said,\n\"that's him.\"\n\n\"All  right, Mike,\" Tyrone said to the man running the  computer,\n\"do a retrieve on OBR-III.\"  Mike nodded and stretched over to  a\nlarge printer on the side of the console.  He pushed a key and in\na few seconds, the printer spewed out page after page of informa-\ntion.   OBR-III  is a super-secret computer  system  designed  to\nfight  terrorism  in the United States.  OBR-III  and  Big  Floyd\nregularly  spoke  to similar, but smaller,  systems  in  England,\nFrance and Germany.  With only small bits of data it can extrapo-\nlate  potential terrorist targets, and who is the  likely  person\nbehind  the  attacks.  OBR-III is an expert  system  that  learns\ncontinuously,  as  the human mind does.  Within  seconds  it  can\nprovide information on anyone within its memory.\n\nTyrone  pulled  the  first page from the printer  before  it  was\nfinished  and read to himself.  He scanned it quickly  until  one\nitem  grabbed  his attention. His eyes widened.  \"Boy,  when  you\npick 'em, you pick 'em.\"  Tyrone whistled.\n\n\"What, what?\" Scott strained to see the printout, but Tyrone held\nit away.\n\n\"It's no wonder he calls himself Spook,\" Tyrone said to no one in\nparticular.  \"He's ex-NSA.\"  He ripped off the final page of  the\nprintout  and called Scott to follow him, cursorily thanking  the\ncomputer operators for their assistance.\n\nScott  followed Tyrone to an elevator and they descended  to  the\nfifth  and  bottom  level, where Tyrone headed  straight  to  his\noffice with Scott in tow.  He shut the door behind him and showed\nScott a chair.\n\n\"There's  no way I should be telling you this, but I owe  you,  I\nguess,  and,  anyway, maybe you can help.\"   Tyrone  rationalized\nshowing the information to Scott - both a civilian and a  report-\ner.   He  may  have questioned the wisdom, but  not  the  intent.\nBesides,  as  had been true for several weeks,  everything  Scott\nlearned  from  Tyrone Duncan was off the record.  Way  off.   For\nnow.\n\nThe  Spook's real name was Miles Foster. Scott scanned the  file.\nA  lot of it was government speak and security  clearance  inter-\nviews for his job at NSA.  An entire life was condensed into a  a\nfew files, covering the time from when he was born to the time he\nresigned  from the NSA.  Scott found much of his life boring  and\nhe really didn't care that Miles' third grade teacher  remembered\nhim  as being a  \"good boy\".  Or that his high  school  counselor\nthough he could go a long way.\n\n\"This  doesn't  sound like the Spook I know,\"  Scott  said  after\nglancing at the clean regimented life and times of Miles Foster.\n\n\"Did you expect it to?\" asked Ty.\n\n\"I guess I never thought about it.  I just figured it would be  a\nregular guy, not a real spook for the government.\"\n\n\"Shit happens.\"\n\n\"So I see.  Where do we go from here?\" Scott asked in awe of  the\ntechnical capabilities of the FBI.\n\n\"How  'bout  a sanity check?\" Tyrone asked.  \"When  were  you  in\nAmsterdam?\"\n\n\"Last week, why?\"\n\nTyrone sat behind his computer and Scott noticed that his fingers\nseemed  almost  too fat to be of much good.  \"If I can  get  this\nthing to work, let's see where's the Control Key?\"   Scott  gazed\non  as  Tyrone talked to himself while working the  keyboard  and\nreading  the screen.  \"Foster, Airline, Foreign, ah, the  dates,\"\nhe    looked    up   at   a   large    wall    calendar.     \"All\nright . . .shit . . .Delete . . . OK, that's it.\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Scott.\n\n\"Just want to see if your boy really was in Europe with you.\"\n\n\"You don't believe me!\" shouted Scott.\n\n\"No,  I believe you.  But I need some proof, dig?\"  Tyrone  said.\n\"If he's up to something we need to find out what, step by  step.\nYou should know that.\"\n\n\"Yeah,  I do,\" Scott resigned.  \"It's just that I'm not  normally\nthe one being questioned. Know what I mean?\"\n\n\"Our  training is more  . . .well, it's a moot point  now.   Your\nMr. Foster flew to Amsterdam and then back to Washington the next\nday.  I believe I have some legwork ahead of me.  I would like to\nlearn a little more about Mr. Miles Foster.\"\n\nScott  talked Tyrone into giving him a copy of one of the  images\nof  Miles  aka  Spook.  He was hoping that Kirk  would  call  him\ntonight.   In any case, Scott needed to buy an image  scanner  if\nKirk  was going to be of help. When he got home, he made room  on\nhis  personal nightmare, his desk, for the flatbed scanner,  then\nplayed  with it for several hours, learning how to scan an  image\nat the right sensitivity, the correct brightness and reflectivity\nfor the proper resolution.  He learnd to bring a picture into the\ncomputer  and  edit  or redraw the picture.   Scott  scanned  the\npicture  of the Spook into the computer and enjoyed adding  mous-\ntaches, subtracting teeth and stretching the ears.\n\nAt  midnight,  on the button, Scott's computer  beeped.   It  was\nKirk.\n\nWTFO\n\nYou got my message.\n\nSUBTLETY IS NOT YOUR STRONG POINT\n\nI didn't want to miss.\n\nGOTCHA.  YOU RANG.\n\nFirst of all, I want a better way to contact you, since I  assume\nyou won't tell me who you are.\n\nRIGHT! AND I'VE TAKEN CARE OF THAT.  CALL 212-555-3908.  WHEN YOU\nHEAR  THE  BEEP, ENTER YOUR NUMBER.  I'LL CALL YOU AS SOON  AS  I\nCAN.\n\nSo you're in New York?\n\nMAYBE.  MAYBE NOT.\n\nAh,  call forwarding.  I could get the address of the  phone  and\ntrace you down.\n\nI DON'T THINK YOU WOULD DO THAT.\n\nAnd why not may I ask?\n\nCAUSE WE HAVE A DEAL.\n\nRight.  You're absolutely right.\n\nNOW THAT I'M RIGHT, WHAT'S UP?\n\nI met with the Spook.\n\nYOU DID????????\n\nThe  conference  was great, but I need to know more.   I've  just\nbeen  sniffing around the edges and I can't smell what's  in  the\noven.\n\nWHAT ABOUT THE SPOOK?  TELL ME ABOUT IT.\n\nI have picture of him for you.  I scanned it.\n\nVERY GOOD, CLAP, CLAP.\n\nI'll send you SPOOK.PIX.  Let me know what you think.\n\nOK.  SEND AWAY.\n\nScott  chose the file and issued the command to send it to  Kirk.\nWhile  it was being sent they couldn't speak, and  Scott  learned\nhow  long it really takes to transmit a digital picture  at  2400\nbaud.   He got absorbed in a magazine and almost missed the  mes-\nsage on the computer.\n\nTHAT'S NOT THE SPOOK!!!!\n\nYes it is.  I met him.\n\nNO, IT'S NOT THE REAL SPOOK.  I'VE MET HIM.  HE'S PARTIALLY  BALD\nAND HAS A LONG NOSE AND GLASSES.  THIS GUY'S A GQ MODEL\n\nC'mon,  you've got to be putting me on.  I travel 3000 miles  for\nan impostor?\n\nI GUESS SO.  THIS IS NOT THE SPOOK I KNOW.\n\nThen who is it?\n\nHOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW?\n\nJust thought I'd ask . . .\n\nWHAT'S GOING ON REPO?\n\nDeep shit, and I need your help.\n\nGOT THE MAN LOOKING OVER YOUR DONKEY?\n\nNo,  he's  not here, honest.  I have an idea,  and  you're  gonna\nthink  it's nuts, I know.  But I have to ask you for a couple  of\nfavors.\n\nWHAT MAY THEY BE?\n\nThe  Freedom League.  I need to know as much about it as  I  can,\nwithout  anyone  knowing that I want the  information.   Is  that\npossible?\n\nOF COURSE.  THEY'RE BBS'ERS.  I CAN GET IN EASY.  WHY?\n\nWell that brings up the second favor.  dGraph.  Do you own it?\n\nSURE, EVERYONE DOES.  LEGAL OR NOT.\n\nCan't you guys take apart a program to see what makes it tick?\n\nREVERSE ENGINEERING, YEAH\n\nThen I would like to ask if you would look at the dGraph  program\nand see if it has a virus in it?\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 24\n\n     Wednesday, January 13\n     New York City\n\n     No Privacy for Mere Citizens\n     by Scott Mason.\n\nI learned the other day, that I can find out just about  anything\nI  want to know about you, or her, or him, or anyone, for  a  few\ndollars, a few phone calls and some free time.\n\nStarting  with just an automobile license plate number,  the  De-\npartment of Motor Vehicles will be happy to supply me with a name\nand address that go with the plate.  Or I can start with a  name,\nor  an address or just a phone number and use a  backwards  phone\nbook.  It's all in the computer.\n\nI  can  find more about you by getting a copy of  the  your  auto\nregistration  and  title  from the  public  records.     Marriage\nlicenses  and divorces are public as well. You can find  out  the\ndamnedest things about people from their first or second or third\nmarriage records.  Including the financial settlements.  Good way\nto determine how much money or lack thereof is floating around  a\nhealthy divorce.\n\nOf course I can easily find all traffic offenses, their  disposi-\ntion,  and any follow up litigation or settlements.  It's all  in\nthe computer.  As there are public records of all arrests,  court\ncases, sentences and paroles.  If you've ever been to trial,  the\ntranscripts are public.\n\nYour  finances can be scrupulously determined by looking  up  the\nreal  estate records for purchase price, terms, cash,  notes  and\ntaxes  on your properties.  Or, if you've ever had a  bankruptcy,\nthe  sordid details are clearly spelled out for anyone's  inspec-\ntion.  It's all in the computer.\n\nI  can  rapidly build an excellent profile of you,  or  whomever.\nAnd,  it's legal.  All legal, using the public records  available\nto anyone who asks and has the $2.\n\nThat tells me, loud and clear, that I no longer have any privacy!\nNone!\n\nForget  the hackers; it's bad enough they can get into  our  bank\naccounts  and our IRS records and the Census forms that have  our\nnames  tied to the data.  What about Dick and Jane Doe,  Everyman\nUSA,  who can run from agency to agency and office to office  put\ntogether enough information about me or you to be dangerous.\n\nI do not think I like that.\n\nIt's  bad  enough the Government can create us or destroy  us  as\nindividuals  by altering the contents of our computer files  deep\ninside the National Data Bases.  At least they have a modicum  of\naccountability.   However,  their inattentive disregard  for  the\nprivacy of the citizens of this country is criminal.\n\nAs  a reporter I am constantly amazed at how easy it is  to  find\nout  just  about anything about anybody, and in  many  ways  that\nopenness  has made my job simpler.  However, at the same time,  I\nbelieve  that  the Government has an inherent  responsibility  to\nprotect  us  from invasion of privacy, and they are  derelict  in\nfulfilling that promise.\n\nIf the DMV needs to know my address, I understand.  The IRS needs\nto  know  my income.  Each computer unto itself  is  a  necessary\nrepository  to facilitate business transactions.   However,  when\nsomeone  begins  to investigate me, crossing  the  boundaries  of\nmultiple  data  bases,  without question, they  are  invading  my\nprivacy.  Each piece of information found about me may be  insig-\nnificant in itself, but when combined, it becomes highly  danger-\nous  in the wrong hands.  We all have secrets we want  to  remain\nsecrets.  Under the present system, we have sacrificed our priva-\ncy for the expediency of the machines.\n\nI have a lawyer friend who believes that the fourth amendment  is\nat stake.  Is it, Mr. President?\n\nThis is Scott Mason, feeling Peered Upon.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Wednesday, January 13\n     Atlanta, Georgia\n\nFirst  Federal Bank in Atlanta, Georgia enjoyed a  reputation  of\ntreating  its customers like royalty.  Southern  Hospitality  was\nthe  bank's  middle  name and the staff was  trained  to  provide\nextraordinary  service.   This morning  though,  First  Federal's\ncustomers  were not happy campers.  The calls started  coming  in\nbefore 8:00 A.M.\n\n\"My  account  is off $10,\"  \"It doesn't add up,\"   \"My  checkbook\nwon't balance.\"  A few calls of this type are normal on any given\nday,  but the phones were jammed with customer complaints.   Hun-\ndreds of calls streamed in constantly and hundreds more never got\nthrough  the  busy signals.  Dozens of customers  came  into  the\nlocal branches to complain about the errors on their statement.\n\nAn  emergency meeting was held in the Peachtree Street  headquar-\nters  of  First Federal.  The president of the bank  chaired  the\nmeeting.   The basic question was, What Was Going On?  It  was  a\nfree for all.  Any ideas, shoot 'em out.\n\nHow  many calls?  About 4500 and still coming in.  What  are  the\ndates of the statements?  So far within a couple of days, but who\nknows what we'll find.  What are you asking people to do?  Double\ncheck  against their actual checks instead of the  register.   Do\nyou  really  think that 5000 people wake up one morning  and  all\nmake  the  same mistakes?  Do you have any  other  ideas?    Then\nwhat?   If they don't reconcile, bring 'em in and we'll pull  the\nfiche.\n\nWhat  do  the computer people say?  They think there  may  be  an\nerror.  That's bright. If the numbers are adding up wrong, how do\nwe  balance?   Have no idea.  Do they add up in our  favor?   Not\nalways. Maybe 50/50 so far.  Can we fix it?  Yes.  When?  I don't\nknow yet.  Get some answers.  Fast.  Yessir.\n\nThe  bank's  concerns mounted when their larger  customers  found\ndiscrepancies in the thousands and tens of thousands of  dollars.\nAs  the number of complaints numbered well over 10,000  by  noon,\nFirst Federal was facing a crisis.  The bank's figures in no  way\njived  with  their  customer's records and  the  finger  pointing\nbegan.\n\nThe  officers  contacted the Federal Reserve Board  and  notified\nthem.  The Board suggested, strongly, that the bank close for the\nremainder of the day and sort it out before it got worse.   First\nFederal  did close, under the guise of installing a new  computer\nsystem,  a  lie  that might also cover whatever  screwed  up  the\nstatements.   Keep  that option open.  They  kept  answering  the\nphones,  piling up the complaints and discovering that  thus  far\nthere was no pattern to the errors.\n\nBy mid-afternoon, they at least knew what to look for.  On  every\nstatement a few checks were listed with the incorrect amounts and\ntherefore the balance was wrong.  For all intent and purpose, the\nbank had absolutely no idea whose money was whose.\n\nWorking into the night the bank found that all ledgers  balanced,\nbut  still the amounts in the accounts were wrong.  What are  the\nodds of a computer making thousands of errors and having them all\nbalance  out  to  a net zero difference?   Statistically  it  was\nimpossible,  and that meant someone altered the amounts  on  pur-\npose.   By midnight they found that the source of the  error  was\nprobably  in  the control code of the  bank's  central  computing\ncenter.\n\nFirst  Federal Bank did not open for business Thursday.  Or  Fri-\nday.\n\nFirst  Federal Bank was not the only bank to experience  profound\ndifficulties with it's customers.  Similar complaints closed down\nFarmer's  Bank  in Des Moines, Iowa, Lake City Bank  in  Chicago,\nFirst  Trade  in New York City, Sopporo Bank  in  San  Francisco,\nPilgrim's Trust in Boston and, as the Federal Reserve Bank  would\ndiscover, another hundred or so banks in almost every state.\n\nThe  Department  of the Treasury reacted  quickly,  spurred  into\naction by the chairman of Riggs National Bank in Washington, D.C.\nBeing  one of the oldest banks in the country, and the  only  one\nthat  could claim having a personal relationship  with  Alexander\nHamilton,  the first Secretary of the Treasury, it still  carried\npolitical weight.\n\nThe evening network and local news stations covered the situation\ncritically.  Questions proliferated but answers were hard to come\nby.   The largest of the banks and the government announced  that\na major computer glitch had affected the Electronic Funds  Trans-\nfers which had inadvertently caused the minor inconsistencies  in\nsome customer records.\n\nThe press was extremely hard on the banks and the Fed Reserve and\nthe  Treasury.  They smelled a coverup, a lie; that they and  the\npublic  were  not being told the truth, or at least  all  of  it.\nOnly Scott Mason and a couple of other reporters speculated  that\na  computer  virus  or time bomb was  responsible.   Without  any\nevidence  though, the government and the banks vigorously  denied\nany  such  possibilities.  Rather, they  developed  a  convoluted\nstory  of  how  one money transaction affects  another  and  then\nanother.   The  domino  theory of banking was  explained  to  the\npublic in graphs and charts, but an open skepticism prevailed.\n\nSmall  businesses and individual banking customers  were  totally\nshut off from access to their funds.  Tens of thousands of  auto-\nmatic  tellers were turned off by their banks in the futile  hope\nof minimizing the damage.  Estimates were that by evening, almost\n5 million people had been estranged from their money.\n\nRumors of bank collapse and a catastrophic failure of the banking\nsystem  persisted.   The  Stock Market, operating  at  near  full\ncapacity  after November's disaster, reacted to the news  with  a\nprecipitous drop of almost 125 points before trading was suspend-\ned, cutting off thousands more from their money.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund convened an emergency meeting  as\nthe  London  and Tokyo stock markets reacted  negatively  to  the\nnews.   Wire transfers and funds disbursements were ceased across\nall state and national borders.\n\nPanic ensued, and despite the best public relations efforts,  the\nTreasury imposed financial sanctions on all savings and  checking\naccounts.  If the banks opened on Friday, severe limits would  be\nplaced on access to available funds.  Checks would be returned or\nheld until the emergency was past.\n\nNightline  addressed  the banking crisis in depth.   The  experts\ndebated the efficiency of the system and that possibly an unfore-\nseen overload had occurred, triggering the events of the day.  No\none suggested that the bank's computers had been compromised.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     New York City Times\n\n\"Yes, it is urgent.\"\n\n\"What is this about?\n\n\"That is for the Senator's ears only.\"\n\n\"Can you hold for . . .\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. I've been holding for an hour.  Go on.\"  Muzak  inter-\npretations  of Led Zeppelin greeted Scott Mason as he was put  on\nhold.  Again.  Good God!  They have more pass interference in the\nfront office and on the phones than the entire NFL.  He waited.\n\nAt long last, someone picked up the other end of the phone. \"I am\nsorry  to keep you waiting, Mr. Mason, it has been rather  hectic\nas  you can imagine.  How are you faring?\"  Senator  Nancy  Deere\ntrue to form, always projected genuine sincerity.\n\n\"Fine,  fine,  thank  you, Senator.  The reason for  my  call  is\nrather, ah . . .sensitive.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" she asked politely.\n\n\"Well,  the  fact is, Senator, we cannot discuss it, that  is,  I\ndon't feel that we can talk about this on the phone.\"\n\n\"That makes it rather difficult, doesn't it,\" she laughed weakly.\n\n\"Simply put, Senator . . . \"\n\n\"Please call me Nancy.  Both my friends and enemies do.\"\n\n\"All right, Nancy,\"  Scott said awkwardly.  \"I need 15 minutes of\nyour  time  about a matter of national security and  it  directly\nconcerns  your work on the Rickfield Committee.\"  She  winced  at\nthe  nick  name that the hearing had been given.  \"I  can  assure\nyou, Senator, ah, Nancy, that I would not be bothering you unless\nI was convinced of what I'm going to tell you.  And show you.  If\nyou think I'm nuts, then fine, you can throw me out.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mason, that's enough,\" Nancy said kindly.  \"Based upon  your\nperformance at the hearing the other day, that alone is enough to\nmake me want to shake your hand.  As for what you have to say?  I\npride myself on being a good listener.  When would be  convenient\nfor you?\"\n\n\"The  sooner the better,\" Scott said with obvious relief that  he\nhadn't had to sell her.\n\n\"How's  . . .ah, four tomorrow?  My office?\"\n\n\"That's fine, perfect.  We'll see you tomorrow then.\"\n\n\"We?\" Nancy picked up the plural reference.\n\n\"Yes,  I am working with someone else. It helps if I'm not  crazy\nalone.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     FBI, New York\n\n\"I'll  be  in Washington tomorrow, we can talk  about  it  then,\"\nTyrone Duncan said emphatically into his desk telephone.\n\n\"Ty,  I've  been on your side and defended you since  I  came  on\nboard,  you know that.\"  Bob Burnson was pleading with Ty.   \"But\non  this one, I have no control.  You've been poking  into  areas\nthat don't concern you, and I'm catching heat.\"\n\n\"I'm working on one damn case, Bob.  One.  Computer crime. But it\nkeeps on touching this fucking blackmail fiasco and it's  getting\non  everyone's nerves.  There's a lot more to this  than  ransoms\nand hackers and I've been having some luck.  I'll show you what I\nhave tomorrow. Sixish.  Ebbets.\"\n\n\"I'll  be  there. Ty,\" Burnson said kindly.  \"I  don't  know  the\nspecifics,  but you've been shaking the tree.  I hope it's  worth\nit.\"\n\n\"It is, Bob.  I'd bet my ass on in.\"\n\n\"You are.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Thursday, January 14\n     Walter Reed Medical Center\n\n\"How is he doing?\"  Scott asked.\n\n\"He's  not  out of the woods yet,\"  said Dr. Sean Kelly,  one  of\nWalter  Reed's hundreds of Marcus Welby look-alike  staff  physi-\ncians.   \"In cases like this, we operate in the dark.  The  chest\nwound  is nasty, but that's not the danger; it's the head  wound.\nThe brain is a real funny area.\"\n\nTyrone's FBI identification was required to get him and Scott  in\nto see Dr. Kelly.  As far as anybody knew, Pierre Troubleaux  had\nbeen  killed  over the weekend in an explosion  in  his  hospital\nroom.    The explosion was faked at the suggestion of the manage-\nment  of  dGraph, Inc. after Pierre's most recent  assailant  was\nmurdered, despite the police assigned to guard his room.   Two of\nAhmed's elite army had disguised themselves as orderlies so  well\nthat  they  weren't suspected when one went in the room  and  the\nother occupied the guard.   The media was having a field day.\n\nAll  would have gone as planned but for the fact that one of  the\nD.C.  policeman  on  guard was of Lebanese  decent.   One  ersatz\norderly  emerged  from the room and spoke to his  confederate  in\nArabic.   \"It's done.  Let's get out of here.\"\n\nThe  guard understood enough Farsi and instantly drew his gun  on\nthe pair.  One of Ahmed's men tried to pull his gun but was  shot\nand  wounded before he could draw.  The other orderly started  to\nrun down the hallway pushing nurses and patients out of his  way.\nHe slid as he turned left down another corridor that ended with a\nhuge  picture window overlooking the lush hospital  grounds.   He\nnever  slowed, shouting \"Allah, I am yours!\" as he  dove  through\nthe  plate  glass window plummeting five floors to  the  concrete\nwalk below.\n\nThe  wounded and armed orderly refused to speak.  At all.   Noth-\ning. He made his one call and remained silent thereafter.\n\nThe  dGraph management was acutely concerned that there might  be\nanother attempt on Pierre's life, so the secrecy surrounding  his\nfaked  death  would be maintained until he was strong  enough  to\ndeal  with the situation on his own. The investigation into  both\nthe shooting and the meant-to-convince bombing was handled by the\nDistrict  Police, and officially the FBI had nothing to  do  with\nit.\n\nDr.  Kelly  continued,  trying to  speak  in  non-Medical  terms.\n\"Basically,  we don't know enough to accurately predict  the  ef-\nfects  of trauma to the brain.  We can generally say  that  motor\nskills,  or memory might be affected, but to what extent  is  un-\nknown.  Then there are head injuries that we can't fully explain,\nand Pierre's is one of them.\"\n\nScott and Ty looked curiously at Dr. Kelly.  \"Pierre had a severe\ntrauma  to  the cranium, and some of the outer  layers  of  brain\ntissue were damaged when the skull was perforated.\"  Scott  shud-\ndered  at  the distinct memory of the gore.  \"Since he was  in  a\ncoma,  we elected to do minimal repair work until he gained  con-\nsciousness and he could give us first hand reports on his  memory\nand  other  possible effects. That's how we do it  in  the  brain\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"So, how is he?\"  Scott wanted a bottom line.\n\n\"He came out of a coma yesterday, and thus far, we can't find any\nproblems that stem from the head injury.\"\n\n\"That's amazing,\" said Scott.  \"I saw the . . .\"\n\n\"It  is  amazing,\"  agreed Dr. Kelly,  \"but not  all  that  rare.\nThere  are many references in the literature where  severe  brain\ndamage was sustained without corresponding symptoms.  I once  saw\na  half inch re-bar go through this poor guy's forehead.  He  was\nstill  awake!  We operated, removed the bar, and when he woke  up\nhe was hungry.  He had a slight a headache.  It was like  nothing\never happened.  So, who knows?  Maybe we'll be lucky.\"\n\n\"Can  we  see  him?\"  Scott asked the Irish  doctor  assigned  to\nrepair Pierre Troubleaux.\n\n\"He's  awake, but we have been keeping him sedated, more  to  let\nthe chest wound heal than his head,\" Dr. Kelly replied.\n\nPierre was recuperating in a virtual prison, a private room  deep\nwithin  the  bowels of the Medical Center.  There were  2  guards\noutside  the  room and another that sat near  the  hospital  bed.\nAbsolute  identification was required every time someone  entered\nthe room and it took two phone calls to verify the identities  of\nScott  and Tyrone despite the verbal affidavit from Kelly.    The\ngroggy  Pierre was awake when the three approached the bed.   Dr.\nKelly  introduced  them and Pierre immediately tried to  move  to\nthank Scott for saving his life.\n\nDr. Kelly laid down the rules; even though Pierre was in remarka-\nbly good shape, still, no bouncing on the bed and don't drink the\nIV fluid.  Pierre spoke quietly, but found at least a half  dozen\nways  to  thank Scott for his ad hoc heroics.  He  also  retained\nmuch of his famed humor.\n\n\"I  want  to thank you,\" Pierre said in jest,  \"for  putting  the\nvalue of my life in proper perspective.\"\n\nScott's  cheeks  pushed up his glasses from the deep  smile  that\nPierre's  words caused.  He hadn't realized that Pierre had  been\nconscious.  Tyrone looked confused.\n\n\"I  begged him not to die,\" laughed Scott,  \"because it  wouldn't\nlook good on my resume.\"\n\n\"And I have had the common courtesy to honor your request.\"\n\nAfter suffering enough embarrassment by compliments, Scott  asked\nPierre  for  a favor, to which he readily agreed.  No  long  term\nkarmic debt here, thought Scott.\n\n\"I  need  to understand something,\" said Scott.   Pierre  nodded,\nwhat?\n\n\"You  told me, in the midst of battle, that dGraph was  sick.   I\ntook  that to mean that it contained a virus of some  kind,  but,\nwell, I guess that's the question.  What did you mean?\"\n\n\"You're right. Yes,\" Pierre said softly but firmly.  \"That's what\nI was going to say at the hearings.  I was going to confess.\"\n\n\"Confess?\" Tyrone asked.  \"To what?\"\n\n\"To  the viruses.  About why I did it, or, really, why I  let  it\nhappen.\"\n\n\"So you did infect your own software. Why?\" Scott demanded.\n\nPierre  shook his head back and forth.  \"No, I didn't do it.    I\nhad no control.\"\n\n\"Then who did?\"\n\n\"Homosoto and his people.\"\n\n\"Homosoto?   Chairman  of OSO?\" Scott shrieked.  \"You're  out  of\nyour mind, no offense.\"\n\n\"I wish I were.  Homosoto took over my company and killed Max.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     The New Senate Office Building\n     Washington, D.C.\n\n\"The  Senator  will  see you now,\" said one  of  Senator  Deere's\naides.   Scott and Tyrone entered her office which was  decorated\nmore  in line with a woman's taste than the heavy  furniture  men\nprefer.  She stood to greet them.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Nancy Deere said shaking their hands.  \"I know  that\nyou're  with  the New York City Times,  Mr. Mason.   I  took  the\nliberty  of reading some of your work.   Interesting,  controver-\nsial.  I like it.\"  She offered them chairs at an informal  seat-\ning area on one end of the large office.\n\n\"And you are?\" she said to Ty.  He told her.  \"I take it this  is\nofficial?\"\n\n\"At  this point ma'am, we just need to talk, and get  your  reac-\ntions,\" Ty said.\n\n\"He's having labor management troubles.\"  Scott thought that  was\nthe perfect diplomatic description.\n\n\"I   see,\"  Nancy  said.   \"So  right  now  this  meeting   isn't\nhappening.\"\n\n\"Kind of like that,\" Ty said.\n\n\"And him?\" She said cocking her head at Scott.\n\n\"It's his story, I'm just his faithful sidekick with a few of the\npieces.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" Nancy said amused with the situation. \"Please, I  am\nall ears.\"  She and Tyrone looked at Scott, waiting.\n\nHow  the hell was he going to tell a U.S. Senator that an  organ-\nized  group of anarchistic hackers and fanatic Moslem Arabs  were\nworking  with  a respected Japanese  industrialist  and  building\ncomputer  viruses.   He couldn't figure out any eloquent  way  to\nsay  it, so he just said it, straight, realizing that the  summa-\ntion sounded one step beyond absurd. All things considered, Scott\nthought, she took it very well.\n\n\"I  assume  you have more than a headline?\"  Senator  Deere  said\nafter a brief, polite pause.\n\nScott  proceeded to describe everything that he had learned,  the\nhackers,  Kirk,  Spook,  the CMR equipment,  his  articles  being\npulled, the First State and Sidneys situation.  He told her about\nthe  anonymous  documents  he had thus far been  unable  to  use.\nExcept  for one which he would use today.  Scott also  said  that\ncomputer viruses would fully explain the banking crisis.\n\nTyrone outlined the blackmail cases he suspected were  diversion-\nary  tactics for another as yet unknown crime, and  that  despite\nmore  than $40 millions in payoffs had been arranged, no one  had\nshowed to collect.\n\n\"Ma'am,\" Tyrone said to Senator Deere.  \"I fought to get into the\nBureau,  and  I  made it through the good and the  bad.   And,  I\nalways knew where I stood.  Akin, I guess to the political  winds\nthat  change every four years.\"  She nodded.  \"But  now,  there's\nsomething  wrong.\"  Nancy tilted her head waiting for Ty to  con-\ntinue.\n\nHe  spoke carefully and slowly.  \"I have never been the  paranoid\ntype; I'm not conspiracy minded.  But I do find it strange that I\nget so much invisible pressure to lay off a case that appears  to\nbe  both global in its reach and dangerous in its effects.   It's\nalmost like I'm not supposed to find out what's happening.  I get\nno  cooperation  from  my upstairs, CI, the CIA.   NSA  has  been\npredictably obnoxious when I started asking questions.\"\n\n\"So why come to me?\"  Nancy asked.  \"You're the police.\"\n\n\"Are  you  aware that Pierre Troubleaux is  alive?\"  Scott  asked\nNancy, accidentally cutting off Tyrone.\n\n\"Alive?   How's  that possible?\"   She too, had heard  the  news.\nThey  told her they had spoken to Pierre and that his  death  had\nbeen  a ruse to protect him.  The reports on  Pierre's  prognosis\nbrightened Nancy attitude.\n\n\"But, it's not all good news.  It appears, that every single copy\nof dGraph, that's a . . .\"\n\n\"I  know  dGraph,\"  she said quickly.  \"It's  part  of  the  job.\nCouldn't live without it.\"\n\n\"Well,  ma'am, it's infected with computer viruses.  Hundreds  of\nthem.   According  to Pierre, the head of  OSO  Industries,  Taki\nHomosoto,  had  Max Jones, co-founder of dGraph  killed  and  has\neffectively held Pierre hostage since.\"\n\nThe  impact of such an overwhelming accusation  defied  response.\nNancy  Deere's  jaw fell limp.  \"That is the  most  unbelievable,\nincredible . . .I don't know what to say.\"\n\n\"I have no reason not to believe what Pierre is saying. Not yet,\"\nsaid Tyrone.\n\n\"There are a few friends of mine working to see if dGraph  really\nis  infected.\" Scott whistled to indicate the seriousness of  the\nimplications.\n\n\"What,  Mr.  Mason, what if it is?\"  She thirsted for  more  hard\ninformation.\n\n\"I'm no computer engineer, Senator, er, Nancy, but I'm not stupid\neither.   Pierre  said that at least 500 different  viruses  have\nbeen installed in dGraph since Homosoto took over.  A rough guess\nis that there are over four million copies of dGraph.  Legal ones\nthat  is.   Maybe double that for pirated copies.\"   Nancy  main-\ntained  rapt attention as Scott continued .  \"Therefore, I  would\nventure that at least eight to ten million computers are  infect-\ned.\"\n\nScott paused as Nancy's eyes widened.\n\n\"Knowing  that  viruses  propagate from one  program  to  another\naccording  to  specific rules, it would not  be  unreasonable  to\nassume  that almost every micro-computer in the United States  is\ngetting  ready  to  self destruct.\"  Scott  sounded  certain  and\nfinal.\n\n\"I can't comprehend this, this is too incredible.\" Senator  Deere\nshook her head in disbelief.  \"What will happen?\"\n\n\"Pierre doesn't know what the viruses do, he's not a  programmer.\nHe's  just  a  figurehead,\" Scott explained. \"Now, if  I  had  to\nguess,  I  would, well, I would do everything  possible  to  keep\nthose viruses from exploding.\"\n\n\"One man's word is an indictment, not a conviction,\"  Nancy  said\nsoberly.\n\n\"There's more,\"  Tyrone said, taking some of the onus off  Scott.\n\"We've learned quite a bit in the last few days, Senator, and  it\nbegins  to  pull some of the pieces together, but not  enough  to\nmake  sense of it all.\"  He slid forward in his chair.  \"We  know\nthat Scott's hacker's name is Miles Foster and he's tied up  with\nthe Amsterdam group, but we don't how yet.  We also know that  he\nis ex-NSA and was a communications and security expert out at the\nFort.\"  Nancy understood the implication.\n\n\"When  I  asked for information on Foster from NSA I  was  stone-\nwalled.   I  assume that I somehow pushed a button and  that  now\nthey're retaliating.  But, for the life of me, I don't know why.\"\nTyrone  shook  his  head in frustration.  \"It  doesn't  make  any\nsense.\"\n\n\"At any rate,\" Tyrone said waving off the lack of cooperation, \"I\nchecked into his background since he left the Agency in '87.   He\nwent  freelance, became a consultant, a Beltway  Bandit.\"   Nancy\nDeere  nodded that she understood but she listened with  a  poker\nface.  \"We have him traveling to Japan shortly after his resigna-\ntion,  and then several times over the next few months.   He  has\nbeen  to Japan a total of 17 times.  Since his credit cards  show\nno  major  purchases in Japan, I assume that  he  was  somebody's\nguest.   The  tickets purchased in his name were  bought  from  a\nTokyo travel agency, but we can't determine who paid for them.\"\n\n\"Seventeen times?\" asked the Senator.\n\n\"Yes ma'am.  Curious.\"\n\n\"How do you know what he used his credit cards for, Mr.  Duncan?\"\nshe asked dubiously.\n\n\"We have our means.  I can't get into that now.\"  Tyrone held the\nparty  line  which meant not confirming or denying that  the  FBI\ncould access any consumer and credit data base in the world.   In\nfact  though, the National Crime Information Center is linked  to\nhundreds  of computers world wide over the Computer  Applications\nCommunications Network.  They can generate a complete profile  on\nany citizen within minutes of the request.  Including all travel,\ncredit  card  and checking activities.  Scott found  this  power,\nentrusted to a few non-elected and non-accountable civil servants\nunconscionable.\n\n\"I have no doubt,\" she said caustically.\n\n\"There's more.\"  Tyrone spoke without the benefit of notes  which\nimpressed Nancy.  \"The case concerning Max Jones' death is  being\nreopened.   It seems that the former Sheriff in San Mateo  county\nwas  voted out and the new one is more than willing to assist  in\nmaking  his  predecessor  look bad.\"  Tyrone  spoke  without  the\nemotion that drove Scott.\n\n\"So what does this prove?\" she asked.\n\n\"It  turns out that Homosoto was in Sunnyvale the day that  Jones\ndied.\"\n\nNancy  Deere  sat in silence and stared out of the  window  which\nonly  provided  a  view of another  office  building  across  the\nstreet.   Despondence veiled her normally affable countenance  as\nshe grappled internally with the implications of the revelations.\n\n\"Senator,\"  Scott  said as he handed her a file  labeled  General\nYoung: GOVT-108.  \"I was wondering if this might have any bearing\non  the tone of the hearings?  It's pretty obvious that  you  and\nRickfield don't see eye to eye.\"\n\nNancy took the file cautiously, meeting Scott's eyes, looking for\nulterior motives.  She found none and scanned the first page that\ndescribed  the  illicit relationship between General   Young  and\nSenator Merrill Rickfield.  Her brow furrowed the more she read.\n\n\"Is this confirmed?\"  she asked quietly.\n\n\"No ma'am,\" Scott said.  \"I read it this weekend and added up two\nand two and, well, it does raise some questions.\"\n\n\"I should say it does. Ones that I'm sure he will not be  anxious\nto answer.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     6 P.M., Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Who  the  hell are you pissing off and why?\"   Bob  Burnson  met\nTyrone and Scott at the Old Ebbett's Grill across the street from\nTreasury at 6:00 PM.\n\nBurnson  insisted that their conversation be off the record,  and\nreluctantly  accepted  that for Scott's  assistance  in  Tyrone's\ninvestigation he would get an exclusive.\n\nFor a full half hour, Tyrone and Scott explained what they  knew,\njust  as they had to Senator Deere.  Tyrone had  other  problems.\n\"I've been running into all sorts of bullshit here, CI, and don't\nforget our midnight rendezvous.\"\n\nBurnson was a reasonable man, and had every reason, more than two\ndecades  of reasons to believe the tale that Tyrone  was  telling\nhim.   Yet,  at the same time, the story carried a  wisp  of  the\nimplausible.   Hackers and Arabs?  But, then, why was he  getting\nheat that Ty was peeking under the wrong logs?\n\n\"What are you planning?\" Bob asked them both.\n\n\"Scott's going after Homosoto,\" said Tyrone.  \"See if he can  get\na few answers.\"\n\n\"And,\" Scott added, \"the Max Jones angle.  I'll be on that, too.\"\n\n\"Right.  As for me?\" Tyrone asked.  \"I sure would like to have  a\nchat  with Mr. Foster.  I can't imagine that he's squeaky  clean.\nThere's no core, no substance, but a lot of activity, and I think\nit's about time to turn a few screws.\"\n\n\"Ty,\" Bob consoled,  \"whoever's button you're pushing has  pushed\nthe Director's, whose aides have been all over my ass like  stink\non shit.  And that's exactly what this smells of.  From a politi-\ncal  angle,  it reeks, and by all rights I should make  you  back\noff.\"  Burnson gestured at Scott.  \"Then we'd have him doing  the\nwork  while  our asses stay clean.\"  He referred to  Scott.    \"A\nperfect case of CYA.\"\n\n\"But?\"  Tyrone suggested.\n\n\"But,\"  Bob  said,  \"just because you're  paranoid  doesn't  mean\nsomeone's  not out to get you.  It smells like pure 100% Grade  A\nGovernment  approved horse shit here, but I'll be fucked if  know\nwhy  CI  is  such a problem.  They normally  love  the  espionage\nstuff.\"\n\n\"They  think  it's  a  crock. Said we  should  stick  to  tabloid\ncrimes,\" Tyrone said defiantly.\n\n\"Unless,\" Scott thought out loud.  Ty and Bob stopped to  listen.\n\"Unless, the NSA has something to hide about Miles Foster.  Could\nthey exert that kind of pressure?\"  He asked Bob.\n\n\"The  NSA can do almost anything it wants, and it has  tremendous\npolitical strength.  It's possible,\" Bob resigned.  \"Listen, I'll\ncover you as long as I can, but, after that, it may get too thick\nfor my blood.  I hope you understand.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I know.  I'll call you anyway. And, Bob?  Thanks.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday, January 15\n     New York City\n\nSkyway-I helicopter flew down the East River at 5:30 A.M.  making\nthe first of dozens of traffic reports that would continue  until\n10:00  A.M.  Jim Lucas flew during the A.M. and P.M.  rush  hours\nfor  8  local stations and was regarded as the  commuters's  Dear\nAbby for driver's psychosis.  His first live-report did not  bode\nwell;  the  FDR Drive was tied up very early; might  be  a  rough\ncommute.\n\nHe crossed 42nd. St. heading west to the Hudson River and noticed\nthat there were already two accidents; one at 5th. Avenue and one\nat  Broadway.  He listened in on the police band for  details  to\npass on to his audience.\n\nAt  5:50 A.M., Skyway-I reported traffic piling up at  the  72nd.\nStreet and Riverside Drive exit of the decrepit and ancient  West\nSide Highway.  And another accident on West End Avenue and  68th.\nStreet.   Jim flew east across Manhattan to 125th.  Street  where\nthe  Triborough  Bridge  dumps tens of thousands  of  cars  every\nmorning  onto  southbound 2nd. Avenue.  Two more  accidents.   He\nlistened  to  the police calls and heard them say  the  accidents\nwere caused because all of the traffic lights were green.\n\nEvery  traffic  light  in Manhattan was green  according  to  the\npolice.  Jim reported the apparent problem on the air and as many\naccidents as he could; there were too many accidents to name.  He\npassed on the recommendations of the police:  Best Stay Home.\n\nBy  6:30 two additional helicopters were ordered to  monitor  the\nimpending  crisis as the city approached real  gridlock.   Police\nhelicopters  darted  about  while the media listened  in  on  the\nconversations from their police band radios.\n\nAt  7:00  the Traffic Commissioner was called at home,  and  told\nthat  he  shouldn't bother trying to come to work.   The  streets\nwere  at  a  standstill.  Thousands of extra  police  units  were\ndispersed  throughout the city in a dubious attempt to begin  the\nprocess of managing the snarl that engulfed the city.\n\nScott  Mason exited from the 43rd. Street and Vanderbilt side  of\nGrand Central Station and was met with a common sight - a massive\ntraffic  jam.   He walked the one block to Fifth  Avenue  and  it\ngradually  dawned on him that traffic wasn't moving at  all.   At\n8:15  A.M. it shouldn't be that bad.  The intersection  at  Fifth\nwas  crowded with cars aiming in every direction and  pedestrians\nnervously slipped in and around the chaos.\n\nScott walked the three blocks to the Times digesting the  effects\nof  the  city's  worst nightmare; the paralysis  of  the  traffic\nsystem.  At that thought his stomach felt like he had been thrown\nfrom an airplane.  The traffic computers.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Washington, D.C.\n\nSonja  Lindstrom watched the New York based Today show  from  the\nkitchen counter in her upscale Reston, Virginia townhouse.   What\na  mess, she thought.  She knew how bad traffic could be  in  New\nYork  even  when the lights worked. A news  flash  pre-empted  an\ninterview with Joan Embry from the San Diego Zoo.  Sonja  watched\nintently.   New York was entering panic mode, and  the  repercus-\nsions would be world wide.  Especially with the banks closed.\n\nThe  New York radio stations linked up with the Emergency  Broad-\ncast  System  so  they could communicate with  the  half  million\ndrivers who had nowhere to go.  Bridges and tunnels into  Manhat-\ntan were closed and cars and busses on major arteries were  being\nforced to exit onto side streets.  Schools, shops and  non-essen-\ntial government services were shut down for the day.\n\nThe  Governor of New York declared a state of emergency  and  the\nNational  Guard  was called to assist the  local  police.   Sonja\ncompared  New Yorkers' reactions to this crisis to the  way  they\ndeal with a heavy snowfall when the city stops.  Pretty much like\nany  other  day.   No big deal, go to a bar, good  excuse  for  a\nparty.  She giggled to herself as the phone rang.\n\n\"Hello?\"\n\n\"Good morning, Sonja?\"\n\n\"Oh,  hi,  Stephanie.  Yeah.  Kind of early for you,  isn't  it?\"\nSonja sipped her coffee.\n\n\"It is, I know, but I had to call you,\" Stephanie said quickly.\n\n\"Something wrong?\" Sonja asked.\n\n\"I  think  so,  maybe.  Wrong enough that I  had  to  tell  you.\"\nStephanie  sighed  audibly. \"You don't have to play up  to  Scott\nMason any more.  I'm getting out.\"\n\n\"Out of what?\"  Sonja said with confusion.\n\n\"I've learned a few things that I don't like, and I've kinda  got\nhung up on Miles, and, well, I feel funny about taking the  money\nanymore.  Especially since Miles doesn't know about the  arrange-\nments.  You know what I mean?\"\n\n\"Yes.  With Scott it bothered me a little.  So I made  believe  I\nwas  on  the Dating Game.  All expense paid  date.\"   Sonja  knew\nexactly what Stephanie meant.  Deep inside she had known that  at\none point or another she would have to meet the conflict  between\nher  profession  and her feelings straight on and deal  with  it.\nShe  had not suspected that it would be for passion, nor  because\nof one of her 'dates'.\n\n\"Besides,\" Sonja added, \"I didn't need to push him into anything.\nHe's  so  hung on this story that it's almost an  obsession  with\nhim.\"\n\n\"That's good to know, I guess,\" Stephanie said vacantly until her\nthoughts  took form.   \"Hey, I have an idea.  Why don't the  four\nof  us  get together sometime.  I'm sure the boys have a  lot  in\ncommon.\"\n\n\"Scott should be down tonight.\"\n\n\"That should be fine.  We were going to dinner anyway.  Maybe  we\ncan put this behind us.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     New York City\n\nThe  traffic engineers frantically searched for the  reason  that\nthe signals had all turned green.  They reinitialized the switch-\nes  and  momentarily thousands of green lights  flashed  red  and\nyellow,  but  there was no relief from the  gridlock.    Computer\ntechnicians  rapidly determined that the processor  control  code\nwas  'glitching',  as they so eloquently  described  the  current\ndisaster.   A  global error, they admitted, but  correctable,  in\ntime.   The  engineers  isolated the switching  zones  and  began\nmanually  loading  the  software that  controlled  each  region's\nswitches in the hope of piecing together the grid.\n\nAt  noon  the  engineers and technicians had  tied  together  the\ndozens  of  local switches into the network and watched  as  they\nsynchronized  with each other.  The computers compare  the  date,\nthe time, anticipated traffic flow, weather conditions and adjust\nthe  light  patterns and sequences accordingly.   Twenty  minutes\nlater,  just as system wide synchronization was  achieved,  every\nlight  turned green again.  It was then that the  engineers  knew\nthat  it  was  only the primary sync-control  program  which  was\ncorrupted.\n\nThe Mayor publicly commended the Traffic Commissioner for getting\nthe  entire traffic light system back in operation by 2:00  P.M..\nThe  official explanation was a massive computer  failure,  which\nwas partially true.  Privately, though, Gracie Mansion instructed\nthe  police  to find out who was responsible  for  the  dangerous\nsoftware  and they in turn called the Secret Service.  The  media\ncongratulated the NYPD, and the population of the City in  coping\nwith the crisis.  To everyone's relief there were no deaths  from\nthe  endless  stream of traffic accidents, but almost  a  hundred\nwere  injured  seriously  enough to be  taken  to  the  hospital.\nWhoever  was responsible would be charged with  attempted  murder\namong other assorted crimes.  All they had to do was find him.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     New York City\n\nTelephoning to another day is about as close to time travel as we\nwill see for a century,  but that's how Scott felt when he called\nOSO  Industries in Tokyo.  Was he calling 17 hours into the  next\nday, or was he 7 hours and one day behind?  All he knew was  that\nhe needed an international clock to figure out when to call Japan\nduring  their business hours.  Once he was connected to  the  OSO\nswitchboard,  he had to pass scrutiny by three  different  opera-\ntors, one of them male, and suffer their terrible indignities  to\nthe  English language.  He told Homosoto's secretary, whose  Eng-\nlish  was  acceptable, that he was doing a story  on  dGraph  and\nneeded a few quotes.   It must have been slow in Tokyo as he  was\npatched through almost immediately.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Mr. Homosoto?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"This is Scott Mason, from the New York City Times.  I am calling\nfrom  New York.  How are you today?\"\n\n\"Fine,  Mr. Mason.  How may I help you?\"  Homosoto was  obviously\nthe gratuitous sort when it came to the press.\n\n\"We  are  preparing  to run a story in  which  Pierre  Troubleaux\naccuses  you  of murdering his partner Max Jones.  He  also  says\nthat  dGraph  software  is infected  with  destructive  programs.\nWould  you like to comment, sir?\"  Scott asked as  innocently  as\npossible under the circumstances.\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Sir? Mr. Homosoto?\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"We  are also interested in your relationship with Miles  Foster.\nMr. Homosoto?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say.\"\n\n\"Are  you  financing  hackers and Arabs  to  distribute  computer\nviruses?\"\n\nNo answer.\n\n\"Sir,  do  you know anything about a blackmail operation  in  the\nUnited States?\"\n\n\"I should have killed him.\"\n\n\"What?\" Scott strained his ear.\n\n\"Mr. Troubleaux is alive?\"\n\n\"I  can't  answer  that.   Do  you  have  any  comment,  sir?  On\nanything?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say.  Good day.\"  The phone went dead.\n\nGuilty as sin.  A non-denial denial.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 25\n\n     Saturday, January 16\n     Tokyo, Japan\n\nDressed as business-like on the weekend as during the week,  Taki\nHomosoto  sat  at his regal techno-throne overlooking  the  Tokyo\nskyline from his 66th floor vista.  It was time.  Years of prepa-\nration  and  millions of dollars later, it was time.   Perhaps  a\nlittle earlier than he would have liked, but the result would  be\nthe same anyway.\n\nThe  first call Homosoto made was to Ahmed Shah in  his  Columbia\nUniversity  office.   Ahmed responded with his PRG  code  as  the\ncomputer requested.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION>>>>>>\n\nGOOD YOU ARE THERE.\n\nI can't get too far without my man-servant.\n\nI WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE.

He found that  he  learned  American\ncolloquialisms  best from American television.   They  brutalized\nthe language under the guise of entertainment.  During a  commer-\ncial  for  'The Quicker Picker Upper', his computer  announced  a\ncall.\n\nHe put the VCR on Quick-Record and sat at his Compaq Deskpro com-\nputer watching the screen display the incoming identification.\n\n     <<<<<<AUTOCRYPT CONVERSATION>>>>>>\n\n          <<PRG RESPONSE?>>\n\nAlex  entered the code displayed on his  personal  identification\ncard.\n\n          G4-YU7-%T64-666.009\n\n          <<ACCEPTED>>\n\nAlex  figured it was Homosoto since this was a very private  com-\nputer.   His other computer, an AST 386SX with 330 MB of  storage\nwas  the  one  his  recruits called with  reports.   The  25  Sir\nGeorge's  of  his  army called twice a day.  Once  to  get  their\nassignments and once to send him the results of their efforts.\n\nThey  didn't have to call long distance, though, and  never  knew\nthat Alex ran his part of Homosoto's operation from Europe.   Sir\nGeorge and his hidden compatriots used their untraceable cellular\nphones  and merely called a local phone number within their  area\ncode.   Alex's communications group had set up a  widely  diverse\nnetwork  of call forwarding telephones to make tracing the  calls\nimpossible.   They  exploited  all of the  common  services  that\nhelped make his and Homosoto's armies invisible.\n\nMR ALEX.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nTHE TIME HAS COME.\n\nSo soon?\n\nYES.  MONDAY IS GROUNDHOG DAY.\n\nMonday? Are you sure?  With no warning?\n\nHAVE I EVER BEEN WRONG?\n\nNo\n\nTHEN DO AS I SAY.  PLEASE.\n\nAlex  started at the word 'please'.  He had never  seen  Homosoto\never use it before.\n\nOf course.  As you wish.\n\nWHAT ARE THE FIRST TARGETS OF THE GROUNDHOGS?\n\nIt is complex.\n\nTELL ME!\n\nThe reservations systems of American, Delta, Pan Am and TWA.   It\nwill shut down air travel for weeks.\n\nGOOD. AND?\n\nThe NBC, CBS and ABC communications computers.  We\nhave  people working in each network.  Plus, we have  land  based\ntransmitters  to garble and override network satellite  transmis-\nsions.   Quite  a neat trick actually.  I'm  impressed  with  the\ntechnology.\n\nI  DON'T  CARE ABOUT YOUR TECHNOLOGY.  I WANT TO KNOW  THAT  THEY\nWILL WORK. WHO ELSE?\n\nThe  list is long.  Groundhogs are at the Home Shopping  Network,\nAmerican Express and other credit card companies.  The Center for\nDisease Control, Hospitals, the IRS, Insurance Companies.  Within\na week, their computers will be empty and useless.\n\nTHAT IS WHAT I WANT TO HEAR. THIS ENDEAVOR HAS BEEN MOST PROFITA-\nBLE FOR YOU, HAS IT NOT?\n\nVery much so.  It is appreciated.\n\nTHEN YOU WILL NOT MIND IF I INCREASE YOUR PAYMENT.\n\nNo. Why?\n\nYOU  MUST  MAINTAIN THE SANCTITY OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS.  NO  MATTER\nWHAT HAPPENS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND?\n\nYes.

THE FREEDOM LEAGUE RUNS A SORT OF FRANCHISE SERVICE  FOR\nBBS'S.   THEY GIVE YOU ALL OF THE TOOLS AND TOYS AND SOFTWARE  TO\nHAVE  YOUR OWN FREEDOM LEAGUE BBS.  SO ANYONE WHO WANTS  TO,  CAN\nSET THEMSELVES UP FOR FREE.  FREEDOM GIVES THEM EVERYTHING BUT  A\nCOMPUTER AND A MODEM.\n\nAnd in exchange, they have to sell Freedom Software.\n\nNOT  EXACTLY  SELL, SHAREWARE IS FREE TO DISTRIBUTE,   IN  THEORY\nONLY A FEW PEOPLE MAY EVEN KNOW ABOUT THE INFECTIONS.  WHOEVER IS\nDESIGNING THE PROGRAMS HAS TO BE IN ON IT.\n\nAnd the franchisers, of course!  They set up their own  distribu-\ntion of viruses.\n\nI WOULD GUESS THAT ABOUT 100 OF THE FREEDOM BBS'S KNOW ABOUT  THE\nINFECTIONS.\n\nWhy, how do you know that?\n\nGOOD  GUESS.   WHEN FREEDOM STARTED UP BACK IN '88,  IT  HAD  100\nLOCATIONS.\n\nSo it was staged, set up?\n\nMUSTA  BEEN.  NOT CHEAP.  A GOOD BBS TAKES ABOUT $10,000  TO  GET\nGOING.\n\nA million bucks.

My main man is going to want to talk to you.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Monday, January 18\n     New York City Times\n\n     dGRAPH INFECTED WITH VIRUS:  DGI OFFERS FREE UPGRADES.\n     by Scott Mason\n\nIn an unprecedented computer software announcement, DGI President\nand  industry magnate Pierre Troubleaux admitted that every  copy\nof  dGraph  sold since late 1987 contains and  is  infected  with\nhighly dangerous and contagious computer viruses.\n\nHe  blamed  Taki Homosoto, chairman of OSO  Industries,  and  the\nparent  company of DGI for the viruses that Troubleaux said  were\nimplanted on purpose.\n\nMr. Homosoto had no comment on the allegations.\n\nSince  there are so many different viruses present in the  dozens\nof  dGraph  versions, (Mr. Troubleaux estimates there may  be  as\nmany  as 500) it is impossible to determine the exact  detonation\ndates  or  anticipated damage.  Therefore DGI  is  offering  free\nuninfected copies of  dGraph to every registered user.\n\nIndustry  reaction was strong, but surprisingly  non-critical  of\nDGI's  dilemma.   In general the reaction was one  of  shock  and\ndisbelief.   \"If this is true,\" said one source, \"the  amount  of\ndamage done will be incalculable.\"  He went on to say that  since\nthe  virus problem has been largely ignored, very few  businesses\nhave any sort of defensive measures in place.  Estimates are that\nlarge  companies  have  the most to lose when  the  dGraph  Virus\nexplodes.\n\nThe  major software manufacturers came to DGI's  support  saying,\n\". . .it was bound to happen sooner or later.  We're just glad it\ndidn't  happen to us.\"   Leading software firms including  Micro-\nsoft,  Lotus, Computer Associates and Borland have offered  their\ndisk  duplication and shipping facilities to assist DGI  in  dis-\ntributing over four million copies of the program.\n\nEven with such support policies by DGI and the assistance of  the\nsoftware industry, there is a great fear that the infected dGraph\nprograms have communicated viruses to other programs and  comput-\ners.  According to Ralph Potter of the International Virus  Asso-\nciation,  \"This  is a disaster of unfathomable  proportions.   It\ncould not be much worse than if DOS had been carrying a virus for\nyears.  The designers knew what they were doing, waiting so  long\nbefore the viruses were triggered to go off.  The ultimate Trojan\nHorse.\"\n\nThe  National Computer Systems Laboratory at the National  Insti-\ntute of Standards and Technology issued a terse statement  saying\nthat  they would soon publish recommended procedures to  minimize\nthe effects of the current virus crisis.  They predicted at least\n2  millions personal computers would be stricken with the  dGraph\nViruses.\n\nOne  dGraph User Group in Milwaukee, Wisconsin has begun a  class\naction  suit against DGI and OSO on behalf of all users who  have\ndamage done to their computers and or data.  They claim at  least\n10,000 co-plaintiffs on the initial filing with District Court in\nMilwaukee and are asking for $10 Billion in damages.\n\nEnd.\n\nScott's story went on to describe that the FBI and Secret Service\nwere taking the threat as a national security risk and would make\na  public  statement in a day or so.  Leading  software  industry\nprophets were quoted, all taking credit for warning the  computer\nindustry that such massive assaults were predictable and prevent-\nable.  They blamed the government and computer manufacturers  for\nlaxidazical  handling of a serious problem that could  have  been\nprevented.  Scott had to make a large chart to keep track of  the\ncompetitive finger pointing from the experts.\n\nDGI's  stock fell 75% after the announcement until the  SEC  sus-\npended its trading.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe Associated Press wire announcement was followed in seconds by\nthe one from UPI.  Doug tore it off the printer and raced it over\nto Scott.\n\n\"I believe this will be of interest to you . . .\"  Doug  chuckled\nas Scott read the wire.\n\n     Tokyo,  Japan:  Taki Homosoto, the billionaire  founder  and\n     chairman of OSO Industries, was found dead this afternoon in\n     his  opulent Tokyo office.  According to police and  company\n     spokespersons, Mr. Homosoto died by his own hands in  tradi-\n     tional  Japanese warrior fashion; hari-kari.  His  body  was\n     found  curled  up in a pool of blood  with  the  ritualistic\n     sword  penetrating  his abdomen protruding  from  his  lower\n     back.\n\n     Police  say  they discovered a note on his person  that  ex-\n     plained the apparent suicide. The letter is believed to have\n     been  hand  written by Mr. Homosoto.  The contents  of  that\n     letter, as released by the Tokyo police follow:\n\n     Honorable  Friends,\n\n     I  now  resign as Chairman of OSO Industries.   My  time  is\n     over.\n\n     For  almost 50 years I have waited to see the United  States\n     and its people suffer as my people did during those terrible\n     days in August.  The United States gave our people no  warn-\n     ing,  and tens of thousands of innocent women  and  children\n     died  without purpose.  This criminal sin is one  which  the\n     United States and its people will have to live with for  all\n     eternity.\n\n     Yet, out of compassion for the millions of innocent bystand-\n     ers who are helplessly trapped by their government's  indif-\n     ference  to  human life, I will give the American  people  a\n     warning: Without your computers your future is dim, and your\n     present becomes the past.\n\n     When I was told about the attack plans on the United States,\n     I  admit that I was a willing but skeptical buyer.  I  found\n     it  hard  to believe, indeed incredible, that  the  greatest\n     military  power  on Earth was so foolish.   I  learned  that\n     there  were  no  defenses for the computers  that  run  your\n     country.  How unfortunate for you.\n\n     It  was shown me how to execute the plans which  invade  the\n     very  bastions of Western Imperialism; and I have  succeeded\n     admirably.  You  will not recover for years, as we  did  not\n     after your hideous attack upon our land.\n\n     By  the  time you read this, I will be dead and  happy.   My\n     creations  will have taken hold, and unshakeable from  their\n     roots, will spread chaos and distrust.  This is the  world's\n     first computer war and I have waged it and I will win it.\n\n     Retaliate!  Retaliate, if you wish, if you can; but you will\n     not,  you cannot. Who do you attack?  My country?  They  had\n     nothing  to  do with it.  My company?  I will  be  dead  and\n     there is no double jeopardy in death.\n\n     You have nothing to say, and nothing to do in response.   As\n     we  did  not  after your fire-bombs landed.   We  could  say\n     nothing.\n\n     Helplessness  is a terrible feeling.  It is one  of  loneli-\n     ness,  solitude in a personal hell which your  people  shall\n     suffer  as they learn to live without the luxuries of  tech-\n     nology.  You will pay for your ancestor's mistakes.\n\n     To the memory and honor of my family.\n\n     Taki Homosoto\n\n* * * * *\n\nScott Mason called Tyrone Duncan immediately.\n\n\"I  know,\"  said Tyrone, sounding out of breath.  \"We're  on  it.\nPierre's  getting additional protection.  It turns out  that  Mr.\nHomosoto  isn't  as pure as the driven snow like he  pretends  to\nbe.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"  Scott asked.\n\n\"Off the record.\"\n\n\"Background.\"  The negotiation on press terms was complete.\n\n\"All  right, but be careful.  It seems that since the 1940's  Mr.\nHomosoto has been performing some very lucrative services for our\nfriends  at  the Pentagon.  He has some  influential  friends  in\nCongress and uses an assortment of lobbying firms to promote  his\ninterests.\"\n\n\"What's so unusual about that?\" Asked Scott.\n\n\"Nothing, until you see that certain Congressmen got very wealthy\nwhen  OSO Industries built plants in their districts.  Heavy  PAC\ncontributions, blind distribution of small contributing funds. It\nalso  appears that he regularly entertained high  Pentagon  offi-\ncials  in the finest fashion.  Paris, Tokyo, Rio, Macao.   Influ-\nence  pedaling and bribery.  We have traced a path from Tokyo  to\nthe  Pentagon  that has resulted in  OSO  subsidiaries  receiving\nlarge  non-classified  government  contracts.   Take  dGraph  for\nexample.  That's a de facto standard for all agencies.\"\n\n\"I never  thought  about that.  Everyone in the  government  uses\n     it.\"\n\n\"Just  like the private sector.  I'm on my way to have  a  little\ntalk with your Mr. Foster.  I don't believe in coincidences.\"\n\n\"Good, where?\" Asked Scott excitedly.\n\n\"Whoah!  Wait a minute.  This is official now, and I can't have a\ncivilian . . .\"\n\n\"Bullshit!\"  Scott yelled into the phone.  \"Don't you get  GI  on\nme.   I gave him to you.  Remember?  Besides, I know him.  And  I\nmight have something else.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"What  if I told you that the Freedom League is part of it?   And\nthat it's being run by foreign nationals.\"\n\n\"So what?\" asked Tyrone.\n\n\"How far did you check into the van driver's background?   Wasn't\nhe Arab?\"  Scott offered tidbits that he thought relevant.\n\n\"Yeah . . .\"\n\n\"When are you meeting Foster?\"\n\nTyrone thought carefully about Scott's words.  \"Listen, I have to\nget  a  warrant  anyway.  It'll  probably  take  till  tomorrow.\"\nTyrone  paused  for the subtle offer to sink in to  Scott.  \"He's\n     listed.  Gotta go.\"\n\nOne hell of a guy, thought Scott.  If it ever got out that Tyrone\nworked with the media like this, he would be immediately retired,\nif not possibly prosecuted.  But nobody else was doing  anything,\nand  Scott had given them Foster on a silver platter.   He  would\nsave the Freedom League story for the moment.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe  Motorola  STU-III secure phone rang on the  credenza  behind\nMarvin Jacobs desk.  He had been Director of the National Securi-\nty Agency, DIRNSA, since 1984, installed in that position because\nhe  gave the distinct impression that he didn't care  about  any-\nthing  except satisfying his mentor; in this case Vice  President\nBush.\n\nThe  STU-III phone added funny electronic effects to  the  voices\nthat spoke over it; all in the interest of national security.\n\n\"Hello?\"  Jacobs asked.\n\n\"Homosoto is dead.\"\n\n\"I heard,\" Jacobs said.  \"It sounded clean.\"\n\n\"Very pro.  Won't be a problem.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nScott saw the galley for the afternoon paper.  The headline, in 3\ninch letters shocked him:\n\n               RICKFIELD RESIGNS\n\nHe immediately called Senator Nancy Deere.\n\n\"I was going to call you,\" she said. \"I guess you've heard.\"\n\n\"Yes, what happened?\" He shouted excitedly over the rumble of the\nhigh speed train.\n\n\"I guess I should take the blame,\" Nancy said.  \"When I confront-\ned the Senator this morning, he just stared at me.  Never said  a\nword.  I begged him for an explanation, but he sat there, expres-\nsionless.  He finally got up and left.\"\n\n\"That's it?  What happens now?\"\n\n\"I see the President,\" she said.\n\n\"May I ask why?\"\n\n\"Off the record,\" she insisted.\n\n\"Sure.\" Scott agreed.  What's one more source I can't name.\n\n\"I  heard about the resignation from the White House.  Phil  Mus-\ngrave.   He  said the President was very concerned and  wanted  a\nbriefing  from my perspective.  He's beginning to feel some  heat\non  the computer crimes and doesn't have a clue.  I  figure  they\nneed to get up to speed real fast.\"\n\n\"It's  about time,\" Scott said out loud.  \"They've been  ignoring\nthis forever.\"\n\n\"And,\" Senator Deere added, \"they want you there, too.  Tomorrow,\n9A.M.\"\n\nThe  hair  on Scott's neck stood on end.  A  command  performance\nfrom the White House?\n\n\"Why, why me?\n\n\"You  seem  to know more than they do.  They think  you're  wired\ninto the hackers and Homosoto.\"\n\n\"I'll be there,\" Scott managed to get out.  \"What do I do . . .?\"\n\n\"Call Musgrave's office at the White House.\"\n\n\"I bet the paper's going nuts.  I didn't tell them I had left  or\nwhere I was going,\" Scott laughed.\n\nScott called Doug who had half of the paper looking high and  low\nfor  him.  \"You made the big time, huh kid?\"  Doug said  feigning\nsnobbery.   \"What world shattering events precipitated this  mag-\nnanimous call?\"  In fact he was proud.  Very proud of Scott.\n\nScott explained to Doug that he would call after the White  House\nmeeting,  and  he wasn't quite sure why he was  going,  and  that\nNancy was taking over the hearings and he would stay in DC for  a\nfew  days.  And no, he wouldn't tell more than was in print,  not\nwithout calling Doug or Higgins - at any hour.\n\nDoug sounded relieved when Scott volunteered that there would  be\nno hotel bills. Phew.  Forever the cheap skate.  The story of the\nyear and he's counting pennies.  God, Doug was a good editor.\n\nScott's  stories  on computer crime and specifically  the  dGraph\nsituation aroused national attention.  Time, Newsweek and  dozens\nof  periodicals began following the story, but Scott,  at  Doug's\nsuggestion,  had wisely held back enough information  that  would\nguarantee the privacy and quality of his sources.\n\nHe was right in the middle of it, perhaps making news as much  as\nreporting it, but with Doug's and the Times' guidance, Scott  and\nthe  paper  were  receiving accolades on their  fair  yet  direct\ntreatment of the issues.\n\nDoug  thought that Scott was perhaps working on the story of  the\nyear,  or maybe the decade, but he never told him so.    However,\nScott  was warned that as the story became major  national  news,\nthe  exclusivity  that he and the Times had enjoyed would  be  in\njeopardy.  Get it while the getting is hot.\n\nNo problem.\n\nIt just so happened Scott knew Miles Foster personally.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Sonja?   I'm  coming down.  Tonight.  Can you recommend  a  good\nhotel?\"   He jibed at her while packing away his laptop  computer\nfor the trip to Washington.  He called her and was going to leave\na  message,  but instead he was rewarded with her  answering  the\nphone.\n\n\"Chez Lindstrom is nice, but the rates are kind of high.\"\n\n\"King or twin beds?  Room with a view?  Room service?\"\n\n\"E,  all of the above,\" she laughed.  \"Want me to pick you up  at\nNational?\"\n\n\"Naw,  I'll  take the train from work.  I may need to buy  a  few\nthings  when I get there, like a suitcase and a  wardrobe.   It's\nkind of last minute.\"\n\n\"I gather I wasn't the prime reason for your sudden trip,\"  Sonja\nsaid in fun.\n\n\"No, it was, I wanted to come, but I had to do some . . .and then\nI found out about . . .well I have to be there tomorrow, but I am\nleaving a day early.\"  He pleaded for understanding, not  realiz-\ning  she was kidding him.  He couldn't tell her why he was  being\nso circumspect.  Nothing about the meeting.\n\n\"Well,\" she said dejectedly,  \"I guess it's O.K.  If.\"\n\n\"If what?\" Scott brightened.\n\n\"If  we  can have a couple of friends over for  dinner.   There's\nsomeone I'd like you to meet.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Holy  shit,\" Scott said as Sonja opened her apartment  door  and\nadmitted Miles and the stunning Stephanie.\n\nMiles stopped in his tracks and stared at Scott.  Then at Stepha-\nnie.  \"What's the deal?\" he said accusingly.\n\n\"This  is Sonja Lindstrom and her friend Scott Mason,\"  Stephanie\nsaid.  \"What's wrong, hon?\"  She still had her arm wrapped around\nMiles' arm.\n\n\"It's  just  that, well, we've met, and I was just kind  of  sur-\nprised, that's all.\"  He extended a hand at Scott.  \"Good to  see\nyou again.\"   Scott warmly reciprocated.  This was going to be an\ninteresting evening.\n\n\"Yeah,  ditto,\" Scott said, confused.  \"What happened to you?   I\nthought you were coming back?\"  He was speaking of Amsterdam.\n\n\"Well, I was a little occupied, if you recall,\" Miles said refer-\nring  to the triplets in Amsterdam.  \"And business forced  me  to\ndepart earlier than I had anticipated.\"\n\n\"Where?  To Japan?\"   Scott awaited a reaction by Miles, but  was\ndisappointed when there was none.\n\nStephanie and Sonja wondered how the two had already met; it  was\ntheir  job  to report such things to Alex, but it  really  didn't\nmatter any more.  They were quitting.\n\nThe  first round of drinks was downed quickly and the tension  in\nthe room abated slightly.  The four spoke casually, albeit  some-\nwhat  guardedly.  The harmless small talk was only a  prelude  to\nScott's  question when the girls stepped into the kitchen.   Per-\nhaps they left the room on purpose.\n\n\"Listen,\"  Scott  whispered urgently to Miles.  \"I know  who  you\nare,  and  that  you're tied up with Homosoto  and  the  computer\nnutsiness  that's going on everywhere.  You have a lot of  people\nlooking  for  you  and we only have a few  seconds,\"  Scott  said\nglancing  up at the kitchen door.  \"I see the situation  as  fol-\nlows.  You get to tell your side of the story to the  authorities\nin  private, or you can tell me first and I put it in  tomorrow's\npaper.   This  may be your only chance to get your  side  of  the\nstory  out.   All  of sudden, you're big news.  What'll  it  be?\"\nScott spoke confidently and waited for Miles' answer.\n\nMiles  intently  scanned  every inch of Scott's  face  in  minute\ndetail.  \"That fucking gook.  You're damn right I'll talk.  First\nof  all, it's a lie,\" Miles hissed.    \"If they're  coming  after\nme,  I have to protect myself.  Can't trust a fucking slant  eye,\ncan you?\"\n\nThe  girls returned with fresh drinks and sat down on  the  white\nleather couch.  Miles and Scott continued their discussion.\n\n\"What happened?\" Scott asked.  Miles looked over at the  stunning\nSonja,  stripping her naked with his stare and then at  Stephanie\nwho had caught his stare.\n\n\"It's very simple,\" Miles said after a while.  His dimples  deep-\nened   while he forced a smile.  \"Homosoto's fucked us all.\"   He\nnodded  his  head  as he looked at his  three  companions.   \"Me.\nRoyally.   How the hell can I defend myself  against  accusations\nfrom the grave.\" He shrugged his shoulders.  \"And you,\" he point-\ned  at  Scott.  \"You've kept the fear going.  Haven't  you.   You\npicked up the scent and you've been writing about it for  months.\nSetting his stage for him.  Like a puppet.  And then?  After  you\nsensitize the public, he commits suicide.  He used you.\"\n\n\"And  then,  you two,\" Miles said to Stephanie and  Sonja.   \"You\ncould  be out in the cold in days.  Bet you didn't know you  were\nin on it.   Am I right?\"\n\n\"In on what?\"  Scott asked Miles and Sonja.\n\n\"Tell him,\" Miles said to Sonja.  \"I've never met you, but I  can\nguess what you do for a living.\"\n\n\"She's a PR person,\" interjected Scott.\n\n\"Go on, tell him, or I will,\" Miles said again.\n\nSonja's eyes pleaded with Miles to stop it.  Please, stop.   I'll\ndo it in my own way, in time.  Please, stop.   Scott glowered  at\nMiles'  words  and awaited a response from Sonja.  How  could  he\ndistrust her?  But what did Miles mean?\n\nThe front door bell rang and broke the intense silence.  It  rang\nagain as Sonja went to answer.\n\n\"Yes, he's here,\" she whispered.\n\nThe door opened and Tyrone Duncan came into the room while anoth-\ner man stood at the door.  Tyrone walked up to Miles.  Scott  was\nin absolute awe.  How the hell?  Ty had said tomorrow.\n\n\"Mr. Foster? Miles Foster?\" Tyrone asked without pleasantries.\n\n\"Yeah,\"  Miles said haughtily.\n\n\"FBI,\"  Ty  said  flashing his badge. \"You're  under  arrest  for\ntrafficking  in stolen computer access cards and theft  of  serv-\nice.\"   Tyrone  took a breath and waved a piece of paper  in  the\nair.   \"We  searched your apartment and found  telephone  company\naccess codes that . . . \"\n\n\"I want to call my lawyer,\" Miles interrupted calmly.  \"Now,\"  he\ncommanded.\n\n\" . . . have been used to bypass  billing procedures.\"\n\n\"I  said I want to call my lawyer,\" Miles again said  emphatical-\n     ly.\n\n\"I'll be out in an hour,\"  he said aside to Stephanie and  kissed\nher  on the cheek. His arrogance was unnerving; this  wasn't  the\nsame Miles that Scott had known in Amsterdam.  There, he was just\nanother  misguided but well-intentioned techno-anarchist who  was\nmore danger to himself than anyone else.  But now, as Tyrone read\na  list of charges against him, mostly arcane FBI  domain  inter-\nstate offenses, Miles took on a new character.  A worldly  crimi-\nnal  whom the FBI was arresting for potential  terrorist  activi-\nties.\n\n\"And  those are for starters, Mister,\" Tyrone said after  reading\noff a list of penal violations by code number.  As if following a\nscript, Tyrone added, \"you have the right to remain silent . . .\"\nHe  wanted  to make sure that this was a clean arrest,  and  with\nthis  many  witnesses, he was going to follow  procedure  to  the\nletter.  Mirandizing was one of the steps.\n\nScott Mason's adrenaline flowed with intensity.  Did he ever have\na story to tell now!  An absolute scoop.  He was present, coinci-\ndentally, during the arrest of Miles Foster.\n\nFront page.\n\n\"I want to call my lawyer,\" Miles repeated.\n\n\"Make it quick,\" said Tyrone.  Miles rapidly dialed a number from\nmemory.\n\nMiles  turned his back on Tyrone and the others and spoke  calmly\ninto the phone.\n\n\"It's me.\"\n\nPause.\n\n\"It's me.  I need assistance.\"\n\nArrogance. Pause.\n\n\"A laundry list of charges.\"\n\nDisinterest. Pause.\n\n\"Had  to  happen, sooner or later, yeah,\"   Miles  said  happily.\nPause.\n\n\"I  gotta dinner party.  I don't want to miss it.\"  He smiled  at\nStephanie and blew a kiss.  \"Great.  Make it quick.\"  Miles  hung\nup.\n\nMiles turned to Tyrone and held his wrists out together in  front\nof him.  \"Let's go,\" Miles said still smiling cooly.\n\nTyrone  gently snapped the cuffs on Miles and ushered him  toward\nthe door.\n\n\"Back in an hour or so,\" Miles defiantly said to Scott, Sonja and\nStephanie over his shoulder as the front door closed behind Miles\nand his escorts.\n\nScott watched in disbelief.  Miles, the Spook, ever so calm, cool\nand collected.  Not a fluster.  Not a blush.\n\nWho  had  he called?  That was the question that  bothered  Scott\nthroughout the rest of the evening.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     The White House, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe  President looked grim.  The normally affable Republican  had\nwon  his second term by a landslide and had  maintained  unprece-\ndented  popularity.  The Democrats had again been unable to  con-\njure  up  a  viable candidate after another  string  of  scandals\nrocked the primaries and the very foundation of the party  itself\nTheir  entire platform focused on increasing the  Peace  Dividend\nbeyond the aggressively reduced $180 Billion Defense budget.   It\nwas not much  of an attack on a President whose popularity  never\nfell  below an astounding 65% approval, and the only ebb was  due\nto  a  minor White House incident involving a  junior  aide,  the\njunior aide's boyfriend and the Lincoln Bedroom.\n\nThe  recession that was started by the Iraqi situation in  Kuwait\nduring  the summer of 1990 was not as bad as it could have  been.\nThe  world wide militaristic fever, proper Fed  Reserve  response\nand the Japanese all took credit for easing the  problem  through\ntheir specific efforts.  In fact, the recession was eased  due in\npart to all of their efforts as well the new Europe.  The  Presi-\ndent  was rewarded, ultimately, with the credit for renewing  the\neconomy almost glitch-free.\n\nBut the President was still grim.  America was again at war,  and\nonly a handful of people in the upper echelons of the  Government\neven knew about it.  It would be in the paper in the morning.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 26\n\n     Midnight, Tuesday, January 19\n     Scarsdale, New York\n\nScott Mason awaited Kirk's midnight call.\n\nNow  that  they  had a deal, a win-win situation,  Kirk  and  his\nphriends  had become gung-ho.  Kirk agreed to help Scott  in  the\ndGraph  and Freedom situations if Scott would make sure that  his\narticles clearly spelled out the difference between the white-hat\nand black-hat hackers.\n\nJournalistic responsibility demanded fair treatment of all  sides\nand  their  respective  opinions, and Scott  attempted  to  bring\nobjectivity  to his analyses.  He did this well, quite well,  and\nstill  was able to include his own views and biases, as  long  as\nthey were properly qualified and disclaimed.\n\nAdditionally, Kirk wanted assurances of total anonymity and  that\nScott would not attempt to identify his location or name.   Scott\nalso  had to agree to keep his Federal friends at a distance  and\nannounce if they were privy to the conversations.\n\nIn  exchange  for fair portrayals in the press,  privacy  and  no\ngovernment  intervention, Kirk promised Scott that the  resources\nof  Nemo would be focussed on finding defenses to the  virus  at-\ntacks in dGraph and Freedom software.  If Kirk and Homosoto  were\nright,  millions  of computers would  experience  the  electronic\nequivalent of sudden cardiac arrest in less than two weeks.\n\nThe Times, Higgins and Doug agreed to the relationship but  added\ntheir own working caveats.  In order to treat Kirk as a protected\nsource,  they  pretended he was a personal contact.   Instead  of\nreporter's  notes, Scott maintained an open file  which  recorded\nthe  entirety  of their computer conversations.   There  were  no\nprecedents for real-time electronic note taking, but Higgins felt\nconfident that the records would protect the paper in any  event.\nBesides,  Supreme Court rulings now permit the recording of  con-\nversations  by  hidden devices, as long as the person  taping  is\nactually present.  Again, Higgins felt he had solid position, but\nhe  did ask Scott to ask Kirk's permission to save the  conversa-\ntions on disk.  Kirk always agreed.\n\nAt midnight, Scott's computer beeped the anticipated beep.\n\nWTFO\n\nI heard a good one.\n\nJOKE?\n\nYeah, do they work over computer?\n\nTRY ME.\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs were in Europe and\ngot  to meet the Pope.

Do you have  pretty  nuns?\"\n\"Of course we do, Dopey.\"  \"Mr. Pope, do you have fat ugly nuns?\"\n\"Why,  yes, Dopey, we do.\"  \"And I bet, Mr. Pope, that  you  have\nsome tall skinny nuns, too.\"  \"Yes, Dopey we do.\"  \"Mr. Pope?  Do\nyou  have  nuns  in  Chicago?\"  \"Yes,  Dopey,  we  have  nuns  in\nChicago?\"   \"And in San Francisco and New York?\"   \"Yes,  Dopey.\"\n\"And  do  you have nuns in Africa and Australia and  in  France?\"\n\"Yes,  Dopey.  We have nuns everywhere.\"  Dopey took a second  to\nthink and finally asked, \"Mr. Pope?  Do you have nuns in  Antarc-\ntica?\"  \"No, Dopey, I'm sorry, we don't have any nuns in  Antarc-\ntica.\"  The other six dwarfs immediately broke out into a  laugh-\ning song: \"Dopey fucked a penguin.

DGraph is now  known\nto  contain at least 54 different viruses, each designed to  exe-\ncute different forms of damage to your computer.\n\nAccording to computer security experts there are two ways to deal\nwith the present virus crisis.  The best way to make sure that an\nactive security system is in place in your computer.  Recommenda-\ntions  vary,  but  it is generally agreed by  most  experts  that\nsecurity, especially in the highly susceptible desktop and laptop\npersonal computers, should be hardware based.  Security in  soft-\nware is viewed to be ineffective against well designed viruses or\nother offensive software mechanisms.\n\nThe  second  way to combat the effects of the dGraph  Virus,  but\ncertainly not as effective, is to build a library of virus signa-\ntures  and  search all of your computers for matches  that  would\nindicate  a viral infection.  This technique is minimally  effec-\ntive  for many reasons:  Mutating viruses cause the signature  to\nchange every time it infects another program, rendering the virus\nunidentifiable.  There is no way to be sure that all strains have\nbeen  identified.  Plus, there is no defense  against  subsequent\nviral  attacks, requiring defensive measures to  be  reinstituted\nevery time.\n\nPreliminary  predictions  by computer software experts  are  that\nbetween 1 and 5 million IBM compatible computers will be severely\neffected by the dGraph Viruses.  Computers tied to local area and\nwide area networks are likely to be hit hardest.\n\nBeginning  today, we will publish the known dGraph Virus  charac-\nteristics daily to help disseminate the defensive information  as\nrapidly as possible.\n\n                    dGraph Version 3.0\n\nVirus #1\n     Detonation Date: 2/2/XX\n     Symptoms: Monitor blinks on an off, dims and gets bright.\n     Size: 2413\n     Signature: 0F 34 E4 DD 81 A1 C3 34 34 34\n\nVirus #2, #3, #4, #5\n     Same as above but different dates.\n     2/3/XX, 2/4/XX, 2/5/XX, 2/6/XX\n\nVirus #6\n     Detonation Date:  2/2/XX\n     Symptoms: Erases hard disk.\n     Size: 1908\n     Signature: E4 EE 56 01 01 C1 C1 00 01 02\n\nVirus #7\n     Detonation Date: 1/22/XX\n     Symptoms: Reformats hard drive.\n     Size: 2324\n     Signature: 00 F1 8E E3 AA 01 F5 6B 0B 0D\n\nVirus #8\n     Detonation Date:  1/23/XX\n     Symptoms:  Over exercises hard disk heads  causing  failure.\n     Requires hard disk to be replaced.\n     Size: 2876\n     Signature: FF 45 7A 20 96 E6 22 1F 07 0F 2E\n\nScott's  article  detailed  all 54 dGraph  Viruses.   Every  wire\nservice  and news service in the country picked up the story  and\nreprinted  it  in their papers and magazines.  Within  24  hours,\neveryone who owned or used a computer had some weapons with which\navailable  to him.  If they chose to believe in the danger.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Wednesday, January 20\n     The White House\n\n\"So what about this Mason character?\"  Secretary of State Quinton\nChambers  asked challengingly.  The President's inner circle  was\nagain meeting to discuss the government's reaction to the impend-\ning chaos that Mr. Homosoto posthumously promised.  The  pre-dawn\nhours  were viewed as an ideal time to have upper level  meetings\nwithout the front door scrutiny of the press.\n\nPhil  Musgrave  pulled  a folder from the stack in  his  lap  and\nopened it.  \"Born 1953, he had an Archie Bunker for a father  but\nhe  came out  a brain - IQ of 170.  Against Nam, who  wasn't;  he\nprotested some, but not a leader.  No real trouble with the  law;\ncouple  of demonstration arrests. City College, fared all  right,\nand  then set up his own company, worked in the defense  industry\nwriting  manuals until he hit it big and sold out.  Divorced,  no\nkids.  Wife is kinda wacky.  The news business is new to him, but\nhe's getting noticed fast.\"\n\n\"Is he a risk?\"\n\n\"The  FBI hasn't completed their investigation,\" said Phil.   \"If\nhe is a risk, it's buried deep.  Surface wise, he's clean.   Only\none problem.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"He's an independent thinker.\"\n\n\"How's he done so far?\"\n\n\"So far so good.\"\n\n\"So we let him continue?\"\n\n\"Yesterday  he said he was willing to help, but I have  a  sneaky\nsuspicion  he'll do better on his own without  our  interference.\nBesides, he prints every damn thing he does.\"\n\n\"What about their identity?\"\n\n\"No  way.  He will maintain source protection, and I don't  think\nit matters right now.  Maybe later.\"\n\n\"What about the FBI friend?\"\n\n\"The FBI is aware of it, and views it favorably.  Duncan's  rela-\ntionship has been exclusively personal until recently.  It  seems\nto serve both sides well.\"\n\n\"So you're saying he's working for us and not knowing it?\"\n\n\"He  probably  knows it, and probably, like most  of  the  media,\ndoesn't care.  His job is to report the news.  It just so happens\nthat we read the same newspapers.  Let's leave him alone.\"\n\nThe  President  held up his hand to signal an end to  the  debate\nbetween State policy and the White House Chief of Staff.  \"Unless\nanyone can give me a good goddammed reason to fix something  that\nseems  to be working,\" he said, \"let Mason do his job and let  us\ndo  ours.\"   He  looked around the Oval Office  for  comments  or\ndissent.  It was a minor point and nobody thought it  significant\nenough to pursue.  Yet.  \"Next?\"  The President commanded.\n\nRefills  of coffee were distributed and the pile of Danishes  was\nshrinking as the men casually dined during their 6:00 A.M.  meet-\n     ing.\n\n\"OSO Industries appears, by all first impressions, to have  noth-\ning to do with the threats.\"  Henry Kennedy was expected to  know\nmore than anyone else at this point.  \"Investigations are contin-\nuing, but we have no reason to suspect a smoking gun.\"\n\n\"One man did all of this?\"  asked the President skeptically.\n\n\"We  have no doubt that he accomplished at least the  dGraph  vi-\nruses  with accomplices and a great deal of money.\"   Henry  knew\nhis  material.  With the combined help of the NSA, CIA,  FBI  and\ninternational  contacts, the National Security Advisor was  privy\nto an incredible range of information.  He was never told direct-\nly that U.S. agents regularly penetrated target computers as part\nof  any investigation, or that they listened in on computers  and\ncommunications to gather information. But Henry Kennedy preferred\nit  this  way;  not to officially know where  he  got  his  data.\nProfessional deniability.\n\n\"We  also  have every reason to believe that  he  used  technical\ntalent  outside of OSO,\" Kennedy continued.  \"Perhaps as many  as\nthirty or forty people involved.\"\n\nThe inner circle whistled.  \"Thirty or forty?  That's a conspira-\ncy,\" commented Quinton.\n\n\"I  agree  with Quinton. What I think we need to do  here,\"  said\nPhil  Musgrave to the others in the room and the  President,  \"is\nexpand our previous definition of terrorism.  Doesn't a threat to\ninternational  stability  and  the economic well  being  of  this\ncountry constitute terrorism?\"  He gazed into each of the listen-\ner's  eyes then said, \"In my mind it clearly does.\"  He  referred\nto  the  work at the Department of State which, since  the  Iraqi\nWar,  had clearly expanded the operational definition of  terror-\nism.\n\n\"There's more,\" Henry said soberly.  \"Four months ago the FBI was\ninundated with reports of blackmail.  None materialized but still\ntake  up  a  great deal of manpower  and  resources.   Classified\ndefense  technology is used to shut down the Stock  Exchange  and\nother major businesses. Two months ago an Irani foreign  national\nwas killed in New York.  He was driving a vehicle which contained\nsophisticated computer monitoring equipment.\"\n\n\"Has anything developed on that front?\" the President asked.   \"I\nremember reading about that.  It was a tragedy.\"\n\n\"It was,\" agreed Phil Musgrave.\n\n\"We had the FBI, the CI division take apart what was left of  the\nvan  and we began a cross trace,\"  Henry pulled out  yet  another\nfile from his stack.  \"It seems that during a two month period in\n1988, a disproportionate number of identical Ford Econoline  vans\nwere  paid for in cash.  As far as the dealer is  concerned,  the\ncustomer disappeared.  Unless they're using stolen plates,  they-\n're part of the DMV system.  The New York van was registered to a\nnon-existent address.  Roadblocked.\"\n\n\"And  don't  forget the First State incident, INTERNET,  the  FAA\nradar  systems,\"   Quinton Chambers said to  the  President.   He\nlisted  a long series of computer malfunctions over the prior  60\ndays.  \"It appears at this point that we have been experiencing a\nprelude,  the  foreplay  if you will, of  something  worse.   The\nHomosoto  letter  makes him as good a candidate as  anyone  right\nnow.\"\n\nEven  Andrew  Coletree felt in concert with the  others  on  this\npoint.  \"If what has happened to computers, the traffic  systems,\nairplanes, to the IRS, the Stock Exchange, Fed Ex, and God  knows\nwhat  else is all from one man, Homosoto, then yes, it's a  army,\nan attack.\"\n\n\"What  if  we declare war?\" Secretary of State  Quinton  Chambers\nsaid, fully expecting immediate agreement with his idea.\n\n\"On who? The Computers?\" jibed Defense Secretary Coletree.   \"The\ndamned  Computer Liberation Organization will be the next  endan-\ngered minority.\"\n\n\"Declaring  war  is a joke, excuse me Mr. President,\"  said  Phil\nMusgrave.   \"It's  a joke and the American people won't  buy  it.\nThey're getting hit where it hurts them the most.  In their pock-\nets.  We have major business shut downs, and they want an answer.\nA fix, not a bunch of hype.  We've had the war on crime, the  war\non  drugs,  the war on poverty and they've  all  been  disasters.\nThings  are worse now than before.  They've had it with  bullshit\nand they're scared right now.\"\n\nThe  President  bowed and rotated his head to work  out  a  kink.\n\"The position of think,\" Musgrave would say.  Then the refreshing\nsnap in the President's neck would bring a smile of relief to the\ncorners of Chief Executive's mouth.\n\n\"What  if  we did it and meant it?\" asked the  President  with  a\ndevilish grin.  No one responded.  \"What if we declared war, with\nthe approval of Congress, and actually did something about it.\"\n\n\"A unique concept,\" quipped Musgrave.  \"Government  accomplishing\nsomething.\"   Penetrating glares from Coletree and  Kennedy  only\nfurthered the President's amusement.  He enjoyed the banter.\n\n\"No, let me run this by you, and see what you think,\" the  Presi-\ndent  thought out loud.  \"We are facing a crisis of epic  propor-\ntions,  we  all agree on that.  Potential  economic  chaos.   Why\ndon't  we deal with it that way.  Why don't we really go out  and\nfix  it?\"   Still no reactions.  \"What is wrong  with  you  guys?\nDon't you get it?  Mediocrity is pass\u001b\u0002\n.  It can't be sold to  the\nthis  country again. For the first time in almost two  centuries,\nthe American people may have to defend themselves, in their homes\nand  businesses on their home land.  If that's the case,  then  I\nthink that leadership should come from the White House.\"\n\nThe  President rose and leaned on the back of his  chair.   There\nwas quiet muttering among his top aides.  \"Aren't you  stretching\nthe  point a little, sir?\" asked the Chambers, the silver  haired\nstatesman.  \"After all, it was just one man . . .\"\n\n\"That's  the  point!\" shouted the President.  \"That's  the  whole\ndamned point.\"  He strode around to the old white fireplace  with\na  photo of George Washington above it.  If permitted, this  spot\nwould be labeled 'Photo Opportunity' by the White House tours.\n\n\"Look  what  one man can do.  I never claimed  to  know  anything\nabout computers, but what if this was a warning?\"\n\n\"Don't get maudlin on us . . .\"\n\n\"I  am  not getting anything except angry,\"  the  President  said\nraising his voice.  \"I remember what they said about Bush.   They\nsaid if he was Moses, he would have brought down the ten  sugges-\ntions.  That will not happen to me.\"\n\nThe inner circle stole questioning glances from each other.\n\n\"This country has not had a common cause since Kennedy pointed us\nat the moon.  We had the chance in the '70's to build a  national\nenergy policy, and we screwed it up royally when oil prices  were\nstable.   So  what do we do?\"  His rhetorical question  was  best\nleft  unanswered.   \"We  now import more than  50%  of  our  oil.\nThat's  so stupid . . .don't let me get started.\"  There  was  an\nobvious sigh of relief from Chambers and Musgrave and the others.\nWhen  the President got like this, real pissed off, he  needed  a\nsounding  board, and it was generally one or more of them.   Such\nwas the price of admission to the inner circle.\n\nThe  President  abruptly shifted his manner  from  the  political\naltruist still inside him to the management realist that had made\nhim a popular leader.  He spoke with determination.\n\n\"Gentlemen,  exactly what is the current policy and  game  plan?\"\nThe  President's gaze was not returned.  \"Henry?  Andrew?\"   Mus-\ngrave  and  Chambers and Secretary of the Treasury  Martin  Royce\nwished they could disappear into the wallpaper.  They had seen it\nbefore, and they were seeing it again.  Senior aides eaten  alive\nby the President.\n\n\"Henry?   What's  the procedure?\"  The President's  voice  showed\nincreasing irritation.\n\n\"Sir, CERT, the Computer Emergency Response Team was activated  a\nfew  months  ago  to investigate  Network  Penetrations,\"   Henry\nKennedy  said.  \"ECCO, another computer team is working with  the\nFBI on related events.  Until yesterday we didn't even know  what\nwe were up against, and we still barely understand it.\"\n\n\"That  doesn't change the question, Henry.  What are the  channel\ncontingencies?   Do I have to spell it out?\"  The President  mel-\nlowed  some.  \"I was hoping to spare myself the embarrassment  of\nbringing  attention to the fact that the President of the  United\nStates is unaware of the protocol for going to war with a comput-\ner.\"  The lilt in his voice cut the edge in the room,  momentari-\nly.  \"Now that that is out in the open, please enlighten us all.\"\nThe jaws were preparing to close tightly.\n\nHenry  Kennedy  glanced  nervously over at  Andrew  Coletree  who\nreplied  by  rubbing the back of his neck.   \"Sir,\"  Henry  said,\n\"basically there is no defined, coordinated, that is  established\nprocedures  for something like this.\"  The President's neck  red-\ndened around the collar as Henry stuttered.  \"If you will  permit\nme to explain . . .\"\n\nThe President was furious.  In over thirty years of  professional\npolitics, not even his closest aides had ever seen him so totally\nout of character.  The placid Texan confidence he normally  exud-\ned,  part  well designed media image, part real,  was  completely\nshattered.\n\n\"Are  you  telling me that we spent almost $4  trillion  dollars,\nfour goddamn trillion dollars on defense, and we're not  prepared\nto  defend our computers?  You don't have a game plan?  What  the\nhell  have we been doing for the last 12 years?\"   The  President\nbellowed  as loudly as anyone could remember. No one in the  room\nanswered.  The President glared right through each of his  senior\naides.\n\n\"Damage Assessment Potential?\"  The President said abruptly as he\nforced a fork full of scrambled eggs into his mouth.\n\n\"The  Federal  Reserve and most banking transactions  come  to  a\nvirtual standstill.  Airlines grounded save for emergency  opera-\ntions.    Telephone  communications  running at 30%  or  less  of\ncapacity.   No  Federal payments for weeks.  Do you  want  me  to\ncontinue?\"\n\n\"No, I get the picture.\"\n\nThe  President  wished to God he wouldn't be  remembered  as  the\nPresident who allowed the United States of America to slip  back-\nward 50 years.  He waited for the steam in his collar to  subside\nbefore saying anything he might regret.\n\n\"Marv?\"   For  the  first time  the  President  acknowledged  the\npresence  of  Marvin Jacobs, Director of  the  National  Security\nAgency.  Jacobs had thus far been a silent observer.  He respond-\ned to the President.\n\n\"Yessir?\"\n\n\"I will be signing a National Security Decision Directorate and a\nPresidential Order later today, authorizing the National Security\nAgency to lead the investigation of computer crimes, and  related\nevents  that may have an effect on the national  security.\"   The\nPresident's  words  stunned Jacobs and Coletree  and  the  others\nexcept for Musgrave.\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"Do  you or do you not have the largest computers in the  world?\"\nJacobs nodded in agreement.  \"And do you not listen in to  every-\nthing going on in the world in the name of National Security?\"\n\nJacobs winced and noticed that besides the President, others were\ninterested in his answer.  He meekly acknowledged the  assumption\nby a slight tilt of his head.\n\n\"I recall, Marv,\" the President said, \"that in 1990 you  yourself\nasked  for the National Computer Security Center to be  disbanded\nand  be  folded  into the main operations of  the  Agency.   Bush\nissued a Presidential Order rescinding Reagan's NSDD-145.  Do you\nrecall?\"\n\n\"Yes,  of course I do,\" said Marvin defensively.  \"It made  sense\nthen, and given it's charter, it still makes sense.  But you must\nunderstand  that  the  Agency is only  responsible  for  military\nsecurity.  NIST handles civilian.\"\n\n\"Do  you  think  that the civilian agencies  and  the  commercial\ncomputers face any less danger than the military computers?\"  The\nPresident  quickly qualified his statement.  \"Based upon what  we\nknow now?\"\n\n\"No, not at all.\" Jacobs felt himself being boxed into a  corner.\n\"But we're not tooled up for  . . .\"\n\n\"You will receive all the help you need,\" the President said with\nassurance.   \"I guarantee it.\"   His words dared anyone  to  defy\nhis command.\n\n\"Yessir,\"  Jacobs said humbly.  \"What about NIST?\"\n\n\"Do you need them?\"\n\n\"No question.\"\n\n\"Consider it done.  I expect you all here at the same time tomor-\nrow  with preliminary game plans.\"  He knew that would get  their\nattention.  Heads snapped up in disbelief.\n\n\"One  day?\" complained Andrew Coletree.  \"There's no way that  we\ncan begin to mobilize and organize the research . . .\"\n\n\"That's  the kind of talk I do not want to hear, gentlemen,\"  the\nPresident said.  Coletree turned red.\n\n\"Mr. President,\" said Chambers.  \"If we were going to war . . .\"\n\n\"Sir,\" the President said standing straight,  \"we are already  at\nwar.   You're  just not acting like it.  According  to  you,  the\nvital  interests of this country have been attacked.  It  is  our\njob to defend the country.  I call that war.   If we are going to\nsell  a Computer War to America, we better start acting  like  we\ntake it seriously.  Tomorrow, gentlemen.  Pull out the stops.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     1:15 P.M., New York City\n\nUpon returning from lunch, Scott checked his E-Mail at the Times.\nMost  of  the messages he received were from co-workers  or  news\nassociates  in  other  cities.  He also heard from  Kirk  on  the\npaper's supposedly secure network.  Neither he nor the  technical\nnetwork gurus ever figured out how he got in the system.\n\nThe network administrators installed extra safeguards after Scott\ntipped them that he had been receiving messages from outside  the\npaper.  They added what they called 'audit trails'.  Audit trails\nare  supposed to record and remember every activity on  the  net-\nwork.  The hope was that they could observe Kirk remotely  enter-\ning the computer and then identify the security breach.   Despite\ntheir  attempts, Kirk continued to enter the Times' computers  at\nwill, but without any apparent disruption of the system.\n\nIt  took  Scott some time to convince the network  managers  that\nKirk  posed no threat, but they felt that any breach  was  poten-\ntially a serious threat to journalistic privilege.\n\nReporters  kept their notes on the computer. Sources,  addresses,\nphone numbers, high level anonymous contacts and identities,  all\nstored within a computer that is presumably protected and secure.\nIn  reality, the New York City Times computer, like most  comput-\ners. is as open as a sieve.\n\nScott could live with it.  He merely didn't keep any notes on the\ncomputer.   He stuck with the old tried and true method  of  hand\nwritten notes.\n\nHis E-Mail this time contained a surprise.\n\n     IF YOU WANT TO FIND OUT HOW I DID IT, CALL ME TONIGHT.  9PM.\n     416-555-3165.  THE SPOOK.\n\nA  pit suddenly developed in Scott's stomach.  The last  time  he\nremembered  having that feeling was when he watched Bernard  Shaw\nbroadcast the bombing of Baghdad.  The sense of sudden  helpless-\nness,  the  foreboding of the unknown.  Or perhaps the  shock  of\nmetamorphosis when one's thoughts enter the realm of the unreal.\n\nThen came the doubt.\n\n\"Ty,\"  Scott asked after calling him at his office.   \"What  hap-\npened to Foster?\"  He spoke seriously.\n\n\"True to his word,\" Tyrone laughed with frustration, \"he was  out\nin an hour.  He said he was coming back to your party . . .\"\n\n\"Never  showed up.\"  Scott paused to think.  \"How did he get  out\nso fast?\"\n\n\"He called the right guy.  Charges have been reduced to a  couple\nof misdemeanors; local stuff.\"\n\n\"So, isn't he your guy?\"\n\n\"We're off, right?\"  Tyrone though to double check.\n\n\"Completely.  I just need to know for myself.\"\n\n\"Bullshit,\" Tyrone retorted. \"But for argument's sake, I know  he\nhad something to do with it, and so do a lot of other people.\"\n\n\"So what's the problem?\"\n\n\"A technicality called proof,\" sighed Tyrone.  \"We have enough on\nhim  for a circumstantial case.  We know his every move since  he\nleft  the  NSA.  How much he spent and on whom.  We know  he  was\nwith Homosoto, but that's all we know.  And yes,  he is a comput-\ner genius.\"\n\n\"And he goes free?\"\n\n\"For now.  We'll get him.\"\n\n\"Who pulled the strings?\"\n\n\"The Prosecutor's office put up a brick wall.  Told us we had  to\nget  better  evidence.  I though we were all on the  same  side.\"\nTyrone's discouragement was evident, even across the phone wires.\n\n\"Still planning on making a move?\"\n\n\"I'll  talk to you later.\"  The phone went dead on Scott's  ears.\nHe had clearly said a no-no on the phone.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Cambridge, Massachusetts\n\nLotus Development Corporation headquarters has been the stage for\ndemonstrations  by  free-software  advocates.   Lotus'   lawsuits\nagainst Mosaic Software, Paperback Software and Borland created a\nsub-culture  backlash against the giant software company.   Lotus\nsued its competitors on the basis of a look-and-feel copyright of\nthe  hit  program  1-2-3.  That is, Lotus sued  to  keep  similar\nproducts from emulating their screens and key sequences.\n\nLike  Hewlett Packard, Apple and Microsoft who were also  in  the\nmidst  of  legal battles  regarding  intellectual-property  copy-\nrights,  Lotus received a great deal of media attention.  By  and\nlarge their position was highly unpopular, and the dense  univer-\nsity  culture  which represented free exchange  of  programs  and\ninformation provided ample opportunity to demonstrate against the\npolicies of Lotus.\n\nEileen Isselbacher had worked at Lotus as a Spreadsheet  Customer\nService Manager for almost two years.  She was well respected and\nran  a  tight ship.  Her first concern, one that  her  management\ndidn't necessarily always share, was to the customer.  If someone\nshelled out $500 for a program, they were entitled to  impeccable\nservice and assistance.  Despite her best efforts, though,  Lotus\nhad  come to earn a reputation of arrogance and  indifference  to\ncustomer complaints.  It was a constant public relations  battle;\nfor the salespeople, for customer service, and for the  financial\npeople who attempted to insure a good Wall Street image.\n\nThe  service  lines are shut down at 6 P.M. EST and  then  Eileen\nenters the Service Data Base.  The SDB is a record of all service\ncalls.  The service reps logged the call, the serial #, the  type\nof problem and the resolution.  Eileen's last task of the day was\nto compile the data accumulated during the day and issue a  daily\nsummation report.\n\nShe commanded the data base to \"Merge All Records\".  Her computer\nterminal, on the Service Department's Novell Pentium-server  net-\nwork began crunching.\n\n     12,346 Calls between 7:31 AM and 5:26 PM.\n\nThat was a normal number of calls.\n\n     Serial Numbers Verified.\n     The Data Base had to double check that the serial number was\n     a real one, issued to a legitimate owner.\n\n     712 Bad Disks\n\nHer department sent out replacement disks to verified owners  who\nhad a damaged disk.  A little higher than the average of 509, but\nnot significant enough unless the trend continues.\n\n     FLAG!!\n     4,576 Computational Errors\n\nEileen's attention immediately focussed in on the FLAG!! message.\nThe Computational Error figures were normally '0' or '1' a  week.\nNow, 5,000 in one day?\n\nShe  had the computer sort the 4,576 CE's into the serial  number\ndistribution.  The Service Department was able to act as a quali-\nty control monitor for engineering and production.  If  something\nwas  wrong - once a few hundred thousand copies hit the  field  -\nthe  error would show up by the number of calls.  But  CE's  were\nnormally operator error.  Not the computer's.\n\nThere  was no correlation to serial numbers.  Old  Version  1.0's\nthrough  Version  3.0 and 3.1 were affected as were  the  current\nversions.   By  all  reports, Lotus 1-2-3 could  no  longer  add,\nsubtract, divide, multiply or compute accurately.  Mass  computa-\ntional  errors.   The bell curve across serial numbers  was  flat\nenough to obviate the need for a statistical analysis.  This  was\nclearly not an engineering design error.  Nor was it a production\nerror, or a run of bad disks.  Something had changed.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Scarsdale, New York\n\nOn  the  6:12 to Scarsdale, Tyrone and Scott joined for  a  beer.\nThe conversation was not to be repeated.\n\n\"ECCO,  CERT,  the whole shooting match,\" Tyrone  whispered  loud\nenough  to be heard over the rumble of the train, \"are moving  to\nNSA  control.

And  night,  preparing\nfor  his  meeting with the President. He would have a  chance  to\nmake his point, and win it, with an audience in attendance.   The\nhigh level bureaucrat craved to aspire within the echelons of the\ngovernment  hierarchy,  but his inate  competence  prevented  his\ngoals from being realized.\n\nDuring  Korea  Lt.  Marvin Jacobs served his country  as  90  day\nwonder  straight out of ROTC.  A business major with a  minor  in\ncivic  administration did not prepare him for the tasks the  Army\nhad in store for him.  Army Intelligence was in desperate need of\nquality  analysts, people with minds more than  marshmallows  for\nbrain.  The Army Intelligence Division G-2 personnel staff poured\nthrough  new recruit files in hopes of recruiting them  into  the\nvoluntary   program.    But   the   catch   phrase,    'Military-\nIntelligence,'  a contradiction in terms' made their  job  doubly\ndifficult.   So they resorted to other tactics to recruit  quali-\nfied  people  for an unpopular and often despised branch  of  the\nmilitary:   they  made deals, and they made Lt. Marvin  Jacobs  a\ndeal he couldn't refuse.\n\nYoung Captain Jacobs returned to the United States at the end  of\nthe  conflict as a highly skilled and experienced  communications\nmanager for the evolving communications technology; as antiquated\nas it appears today.  His abilities were widely needed by  emerg-\ning factions of the government as McCarthyism and the fear of the\nRed Menace were substituted for Hot War.\n\nThe  super  secret  NSA, whose existence was unknown  to  a  vast\nmajority  of Congress at that time, made him the best offer  from\nall  the Federal Agencies.  The payscales were the same, but  the\nworking  conditions  promised were far superior  at  the  Agency.\nMarvin  Jacobs  had studied to serve as a civil servant,  but  he\nimagined himself in Tecumseh, Michigan politics, not  confronting\nthe Communist Threat.\n\nHe  was  rewarded  for his efforts, handsomely.   In  the  sports\nworld,  they call it a signing bonus.  In the deep dark  untrace-\nable world of the National Security Agency they call it All  Paid\nReconnaissance.  APR, for short.  Travel when and where you like,\nostensibly  on  behalf  of your government.  If  worse  comes  to\nworst, attend a half day seminar and make yourself seen.\n\nBy  the  time he was thirty-five, Marvin Jacobs, now a  well  re-\nspected  management fixture at the NSA, had seen the world  twice\nover.   Occasionally he traveled on business.  For the first  ten\nyears  with the Agency he traveled with his wife, college  sweet-\nheart  Sarah Bell, and then less so as their three  children  ma-\ntured.  Still, although he now travels alone more often than not,\nhe was on a plane going somewhere at least twice a month, if only\nfor a weekend.\n\nThe  Directorship  of the NSA landed in his lap  unexpectedly  in\n1985, when the schism between the Pentagon and the Fort became an\nunsurvivable  political  nightmare for his  predecessor.   Marvin\nJacobs, on the other hand, found the job the deserved cherry on a\ncareer dedicated to his country.  It was largely a political job,\nand  managing  the competing factions of his huge  secret  empire\noccupied most of his time.\n\nThe prestige, the power, the control and the responsibility alone\nwasn't  enough for Marvin Jacobs.  He wanted more.  He wanted  to\nmake a difference.  A very dangerous combination.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"It  is  so good to hear your voice, Ahmed Shah,\"   Beni  Rafjani\nsaid in Farsi over an open clear overseas line.\n\n\"And  you. I am but Allah's servant,\" replied Ahmed,  bowing  his\nhead slightly as he spoke.\n\n\"As we all are.  But today I call to say you can come home.\"\n\n\"Home?   Iran?\"  The excitement in Ahmed's voice was more due  to\nthe call than the news.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"I  thought you would be pleased, now that the Red Sun has  set.\"\nThe  cryptic  reference to the death of  Homosoto  wouldn't  fool\nanybody listening, but inuendo was non-admissible.\n\n\"Yes,  my  work is going well, and I have learned much,  as  have\nhundreds  of students that attend my classes.  However, with  all\ndue  respect,  I think we may accomplish more by  continuing  the\nwork that our esteemed leader began.  Why should we stop now?  It\ngoes very well - in our favor.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Rafjani said with respect.  \"You are honored  for\nyour sacrifice, living among the infidels.\"\n\n\"It must be done.  I mean no disrespect.\"\n\n\"You  do  not  speak disrepectfully, Ahmed Shah.   Your  work  is\nimportant  to your people.  If that is your wish,  continue,  for\nyou do it well.\"\n\n\"Thank  you, thank you.  Even though one grain of sand has  blown\naway, the rest of the desert retains great power.\"\n\n\"Ahmed Shah, may Allah be with you.\"\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 27\n\n     Thursday, January 21\n     The White House, Washington, D.C.\n\nHe wanted to make them wait.\n\nThe  President decided to walk into the breakfast room for  their\nearly  morning meeting a few minutes late.  Even with  intimates,\nthe awe of the Presidency was still intact.  His tardiness  added\nto  the  tension  that they all felt as a result  of  the  recent\nrevelations.  Perhaps the tension would further hone their atten-\ntion and dialogue.\n\nHe  had  not  slept well the night before; he  was  prepared  for\nanything  he understood, but computers were not on his roster  of\nacquired  fluencies.   A President has to make  decisions,  tough\ndecisions,  life and death decisions, but decisions of  the  type\nthat  have  a history to study and a lesson to learn.   And  like\nmost  of  those before him, he was well equipped  to  make  tough\ndecisions,  right  or wrong.  Presidents have to  have  the  self\nconfidence  and internal resolve to commit themselves, and  their\nnation,  to a course of action.  This President's political  life\ntrained him well; lawyer, local politics, state politics and then\nWashington.\n\nBut  not  computers.  He was not trained in  computers.   He  had\nlearned to type, a little, and found that sending E-Mail messages\nwas great fun.  To him it was a game.  Since the first days  when\nmicrocomputers  had invaded the offices of governmental  Washing-\nton,  he had been able to insulate himself from their day to  day\nuse.  All the same, every desk he had occupied was adjoined by  a\npowerful microcomputer fitted with the finest graphics, the  best\nprinter and an elite assortment of software.  He used the  memory\nresident calculator and sent and received electronic mail.   That\nwas it.\n\nThe  President, as most men of his generation, accepted the  fact\nthat  computers  now  ran the show.  The  whole  shooting  match.\nEspecially the military.  The communications and computer sophis-\ntication used by the Allies enthralled the world during the Iraqi\nWar:  bombs  smart enough to pick which window they  would  enter\nbefore  detonating, missiles smart enough to fly at 2000 mph  and\ndestroy  an incoming missile moving at 3000 mph.  It  turned  out\nthat  hitting  a  bullet with a bullet was  possible  after  all.\nIntuitively, the President knew that the crisis developing before\nhis  eyes  meant massive computer damage, and  the  repercussions\nwould be felt through the economy and the country.\n\nHowever,  the  President did not have enough computer  basics  to\nbegin to understand the problem, much less the answers.  This was\nthe first time during his administration that major tactical  and\npolicy  decisions would be made primarily by others.  His  was  a\nduty  of rubber stamping.  That worry frustrated his attempts  at\nsleeping  and  nagged at him before the meeting.   And  then,  of\ncourse, there was the press.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\"  the President said sauntering towards his chair  at\nthe head of the large formal breakfast table.  He opened the door\nwith enough vigor to startle his guests.  He maintained his usual\nheads-up  smile and spry gait as he noticed that there  were  new\nfaces present.\n\nIn addition to the inner circle, Marvin Jacobs asked two key  NSA\nsecurity  analysts to be observers at the meeting.  Only if   the\nPresident  asked  a  question was it then  all  right  to  speak.\nAccompanying  Phil  Musgrave, under admitted duress  to  repay  a\nprevious  favor,  was Paul Trump, Director of NIST,  the  eternal\nrival  of  the NSA in matters of computers.   The  President  was\nintroduced  to the guests and smiled to himself.   He  recognized\nthat the political maneuvering was beginning already.  Maybe  the\ncompetition would help, he thought.\n\n\"Marv,\"  the President said leaning away from the waiter  pouring\nhis coffee.  This was the same waiter who had spilled near  boil-\ning  liquid in his lap last month.  \"I guess it's your  show,  so\nI'll  just  sit  back and keep my mouth shut.\"   He  leaned  even\nfurther  away as the waiter's clumsiness did not  inspire  confi-\ndence.\n\nGroup chuckle notwithstanding, everyone in the inner circle  knew\nwhat  the President really meant.  The President was  hungry  and\nMarv Jacobs would not be eating breakfast.  He would be answering\nquestions.\n\n\"Thank  you, sir,\" Marv said as he courteously  acknowledged  the\npresence of the others.  He handed out a file folder to  everyone\nin the room.  Each was held together with a red strap labeled TOP\nSECRET that sealed the package.  Not until the President began to\nopen his package did the others follow suit.\n\n\"We've only had a day to prepare . . .\" Marvin Jacobs began.\n\n\"I know,\" the President said wiping the corner of his mouth  with\na  white linen napkin.  \"That should have been plenty  of  time.\"\nMarvin,  wisely avoided responding to the President's  barb.   He\ntook  the  caustic  hit as the other  breakfast  guests   quietly\nthanked  the powers on high that it was someone elses turn to  be\nin  the hot seat.  All in all, though, the President was  a  much\ncalmer person this morning than during his verbal tirade the  day\nbefore.  But, if needed, the acerbity of his biting  words  would\nsilence  the boldest of his advisors or enemies.   The  President\nwas still royally pissed off.\n\n\"We  have  developed a number of scenarios that will  be  refined\nover  the  next weeks as we learn more about the  nature  of  the\nassault  by Homosoto.\"  He turned into his report  and  indicated\nthat everyone should turn to page 4.  \"This is sketchy, but based\nupon  what  we have seen already, we can estimate the  nature  of\nwhat we're up against.\"\n\nPage 4 contained three Phrases.\n\n     1. Malevolent Self Propagating Software Programs (Viruses)\n     2. Unauthorized Electromagnetic Pulses and Explosions\n     3. Anti-TEMPEST Coherent Monitor and Pixel Radiation.\n\nMarvin  Jacobs described the observed behavior of each  category,\nbut  nonetheless  the President was unhappy.  A rehash  from  the\nnewspapers.\n\n\"That's  it?\"  the President asked in disbelief.  \"You call  that\nan estimate?  I can find out more than that from CNN.\"\n\n\"At this point, that's about it.\"\n\n\"I  still  can't believe this,\" the President said,  shaking  his\nhead.   \"What the hell am I going to say when I have to face  the\npress?   'Sorry  folks, our computers and the country  are  going\ndown  the toilet, and we really don't know what to do  about  it.\nSeems  as if no one took the problem seriously'\"   The  President\ngazed  at Marvin and Henry Kennedy, half expecting them to  break\ninto tears.  \"Bullshit!\"\n\n\"Sir, may I be blunt?\"  Marvin asked.\n\n\"Of  course, please.  That's what we're here for,\" the  President\nsaid, wondering how blunt was blunt.\n\n\"Sir,  this is certainly no time to place blame on anyone, but  I\ndo think that at a minimum some understanding is in order.\"   All\neyes turned to Jacobs as he spoke.  \"Sir, the NSA has been in the\nbusiness of safeguarding military computer systems for years.\"\n\n\"That's arguable,\" said the President critically.\n\nMarvin  continued  unaffected.  \"Cryptography and  listening  and\ndeciphering  are our obvious strong points.  But neither  Defense\nnor Treasury,\" he said alluding to each representative from their\nrespective agencies, \"can spend money without Congress's  approv-\nal.   Frankly sir, that is one of the major stumbling  blocks  we\nhave encountered in establishing a coherent security policy.\"\n\n\"That's  a  pile of bull, Marv,\" said NIST's feisty  Paul  Trump.\nPaul and Marv had known each other for years, became friends  and\nthen as the NIST-NSA rift escalated in '89 and '90, they saw less\nof each other on a social basis.  \"Sir,\" Paul spoke to the Presi-\ndent, \"I'm sorry for interrupting . . .\"\n\n\"Say what you have to say.\"\n\n\"Yessir.\"   Trump  had no trouble being direct  either.   Nearing\nmandatory retirement age had made Trump more daring.  Willing  to\ntake  more risks in the best interest of NIST and  therefore  the\nnation.   Spry and agile, Paul Trump looked twenty years  younger\nwith no signs of slowing down.\n\n\"Sir,  the reason that we don't have any security in the  govern-\nment  is  due  to Congress.  We, Marv and I, agree  on  that  one\npoint.  Martin, do you concur?\"\n\nTreasury  Secretary Martin Royce vigorously nodded in  agreement.\n\"We've been mandated to have security for years, but no one  says\nwhere the money's coming from.  The hill made the laws but didn't\nfinish the job.\"\n\nThe  President  enjoyed the banter among his  elite  troops.   He\nthrived  on open dissent and debate, making it easier for him  to\nweigh information and opinions.  That freedom reminded him of how\ndifficult  it must have been for the Soviets to  openly  disagree\nand consider unpopular positions.\n\nIt seems that after Khrushchev took over,  in one Politburo meet-\ning,  he  received a handwritten note which said: 'If  you're  so\nliberal,  how  come you never stood up  to  Stalin.'   Khrushchev\nscoured the room for a clue as to who made the insulting comment.\nAfter  a tense few seconds he said, 'would the comrade who  wrote\nthis  stand up so I may answer him face to face?'  No one  stood.\n'Now, you know the answer.'\n\nThe President's point was, around here anything goes, but I'm the\nboss.   The difference is the democratic process, he  would  say,\nthe  voters  elect  me by a majority to  institute  a  benevolent\noligarchy.  And I, he pointed at himself, am the oligarch.\n\nPaul Trump continued.  \"In reality sir, NIST has tried to cooper-\nate  with  NSA in a number of programs to raise the  security  of\nmany sectors of the government, but, in all fairness, NSA has put\nup constant roadblocks in the name of national security.  The CMR\nproblem  for  the commercial sector has been  completely  ignored\nunder the cloak of classified specifications.\"\n\n\"TEMPEST is a classified program . . .\"  Marvin objected  strenu-\nously.\n\n\"Because  you  want  it to be,\" Trump  retorted  instantly.   \"It\ndoesn't  have  to be, and you know it.  Sir,\" he  turned  to  the\nPresident.   \"TEMPEST  is . . .\"  The President  nodded  that  he\nknew.  \"The specification for TEMPEST may have been considered  a\nlegitimate  secret  when the program started in the  '70's.   But\nnow, the private sector is publishing their own results of  stud-\nies  duplicating  what  we did 20 years ago.   The  Germans,  the\nDutch,  the French, just about everybody but the English  and  us\nhas  admitted  that CMR is a problem for everyone, not  just  the\nmilitary.   Jesus,  you  can buy anti-Tempest  plans  in  Popular\nScience.  Because of NSA's protectiveness of a secret that is  no\nlonger  a secret, the entire private sector is vulnerable to  CMR\nand  anti-TEMPEST assaults.  As a country, we have no  electronic\nprivacy.\"\n\nMarvin  nodded  in agreement.  \"You're damn right we  keep  it  a\nsecret.   Why  the hell should we tell the world how  to  protect\nagainst  it?  By doing that, we not only define the exact  degree\nof  our own exposure, but teach our enemies how to protect  them-\nselves.  It should be classified.\"\n\n\"And everyone else be damned?\"  Trump challenged Jacobs.\n\n\"I  wouldn't  put it that way, but NSA is a DoD  oriented  agency\nafter all.  Ask Congress,\" Marvin said resolutely.\n\n\"That's the most alienating, arrogant isolationist attitude  I've\never heard,\" Paul Trump said.  \"Regardless of what you may think,\nthe  NSA  is not the end-all be-all, and as you  so  conveniently\ndismiss, the NSA is not trusted by many outside the U.S..  We  do\nnot have a technology monopoly on TEMPEST any more than we do  on\nthe  air  we  breathe.\"  Trump threw up  his  hands  in  disgust.\n\"Patently absurd paranoia . . .\"\n\n\"Paul,  you don't have all the facts . . .\" objected Marv  to  no\navail.  Trump was a master at debate.\n\n\"Sir,\"  Trump again turned from the argumentative Jacobs  to  the\nPresident.   \"I  don't think this is proper forum  for  rehashing\nhistory, but it should be noted that NIST is responsible for non-\ndefense  computer security, and we have a staff and  budget  less\nthan 1% of theirs.  The job just isn't getting done.  Personally,\nI  consider the state of security within the government to be  in\ntotal chaos.  The private sector is in even worse shape, and it's\nour own fault.\"\n\n\"Phil?\" the President said. \"Emergency funding. Congress.\"   Phil\nnodded  as the debate continued.  \"None of this is saying a  damn\nthing  about what we should do.  How do we best defend?\"  He  bit\noff  the end of crispy slice of bacon waiting for the  answer  he\nknew would be unsatisfactory.\n\n\"We improvise.\"\n\n\"Improvise!  That's  the best you can do?\"  The  President  threw\ndown  his napkin and it slipped off the table to the floor as  he\nshoved his chair back.\n\n\"This  country  is  run by goddamned  computers,\"  the  President\nmuttered  loudly as he paced the breakfast room.  Those  who  had\nbeen eating ceased long ago.  \"Goddamned computers and morons.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Thursday, January 21\n\n     SPREADSHEETS STOP CRUNCHING\n     LOTUS AND MICROSOFT STRUCK\n     by Scott Mason\n\nLast weekend's threats made by the late OSO Industries  Chairman,\nTaki Homosoto appear to be a trustworthy mirror of the future.\n\nLotus Development Corporation and Microsoft, two of the  software\nindustry's  shining  stars are the latest victims  of  Homosoto's\nvengeful attack upon the computer systems of the United States.\n\nWith  cases  of 20-20 hindsight proliferating,  security  experts\nclaim that we should have seen it coming.\n\nThe  last  several months has been filled with a long  series  of\ncolossal computer failures, massive virus attacks and the magnet-\nic  bombing  of major computer installations.   These  apparently\nunrelated computer crimes, occurring with unprecedented frequency\nhave  the distinct flavor of a prelude to the  promises  Homosoto\nmade  in the self penned note that accompanied his  seeming  sui-\ncide.\n\nThe  latest virus debacle comes immediately on the heels  of  the\nannouncement of the dGraph infections.\n\nYesterday,  Lotus and Microsoft and their dealers were  inundated\nwith technical support calls.  According to reports, the industry\nstandard  1-2-3  and  the popular Excel  spreadsheets  have  been\nexperiencing  cataclysmic  failures in the field.   Typical  com-\nplaints  claim the powerful spreadsheet programs  are  performing\nbasic  mathematical functions incorrectly; a  veritable  disaster\nfor anyone who relies upon the accuracy of their numbers.\n\nThe leading theory held by both companies as well as software and\nsecurity  experts, is that a highly targeted computer  virus  was\ndesigned  to only affect Lotus and Microsoft  spreadsheet  files.\nWhile  some viruses are designed to erase files, or  entire  hard\ndisks,  the  Lotus Virus as it has been informally  named,  is  a\nhighly  sophisticated virus designed only to make subtle  changes\nin the results of mathematical calculations.\n\nViruses  of  this type are known as Slight  Viruses.   They  only\ninfect  small portions of the computer or program, and then  only\nin ways that will hopefully not be detected for some time -  thus\ncompounding the damage.\n\nFortune  100  companies  that use either 1-2-3  or  Excel  nearly\nunanimously announced that they will put a moratorium on the  use\nof  both  programs  until further  notice.   Gibraltar  Insurance\nissued a terse statement:  \"Due to the potential damage caused by\nthe offending software, we will immediately begin installation of\ncompatible  spreadsheet programs and verify the accuracy  of  all\ndata.  Our attorneys are studying the matter at this time.\"\n\nLotus and Microsoft stock plummeted 36% and 27% respectively.\n\n* * * * *\n\nGOOD ARTICLE.  DO YOU WANT TO GET IT RIGHT NOW?\n\nI see humility reigns right up there with responsibility.\n\nTHE  FIRST LOTUS VIRUSES WERE WRITTEN IN LATE 1988.   CUTE,  HUH?\nTHE LONGEST VIRUS INCUBATION PERIOD EVER!\n\nNot many people share your sense of achievement.\n\nI DON'T EXPECT SO.\n\nWe should get something straight right off.\n\nARE YOU SAVING?\n\nI  am  now.   I do not approve, in fact I despise  what  you  say\nyou've done.\n\nI AM NOT LOOKING FOR APPROVAL.  MAYBE UNDERSTANDING.\n\nNot from me.\n\nYOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT.  IF WE DO THIS, YOU NEED TO PRESENT BOTH\nSIDES.  IT'S TO YOUR BENEFIT.  YOU'RE GOING FOR A PULITZER.\n\nDon't tell me how to do my job.\n\nLET'S GET TO IT.\n\nFine.  Where did I go wrong in the article?\n\nNOT WRONG, INCOMPLETE.  THERE ARE REALLY 6 VERSIONS OF THE  LOTUS\nVIRUS.  ONLY THE FIRST ONE HAS BEEN DETECTED.  THE OTHERS  AREN'T\nSET TO GO OFF UNTIL LOTUS HAS TIME TO CLEAN UP THE FIRST MESS.\n\nYou mean you built several viruses all aimed at Lotus programs?\n\nAND  MICROSOFT,  ASHTON TATE, BORLAND, CA, NOVELL,  LAN  MANAGER,\nWORDPERFECT,  AND A WHOLE BUNCH MORE.  THE LIST WAS OVER  100  TO\nBEGIN WITH.\n\n100?  How many viruses?  When?\n\nSLIGHT  VIRUSES!  I LOVE IT.  WHAT A NAME.  LIKE I  SAID,  YOU'RE\nGOOD.   I GUESS 500.  MAYBE MORE.  THEY'RE SET TO GO OFF FOR  THE\nNEXT  TWO  YEARS.  TIME RELEASED.  TIME RELEASE  SLIGHT  VIRUSES.\nWHEW!\n\nWhy?  Why tell me now?\n\nSLOW DOWN.  NOT ALL AT ONCE.  FIRST OF ALL, WE HAVE TO BUILD  YOU\nA LITTLE CREDIBILITY.  CONVINCE YOUR PUBLIC THAT I AM WHO I SAY I\nAM AND THAT I CANNOT BE TOUCHED.  SO HERE'S THE FIRST LOTUS VIRUS\nSIGNATURE  - THE CURRENT ONE:  05 55 EF E0 F4 D8 6C 41 44 40  4D.\nIN  COMPUTERS THAT ARE INFECTED, BUT HAVEN'T YET STRUCK YET,  THE\nVIRUS  IS  TWO HIDDEN FILES:  ONE SHORT  ONE  NAMED  7610012.EXE.\nIT'S  ONLY 312 BYTES LONG AND HIDES ITSELF IN THE ROOT  DIRECTORY\nBY  LOOKING  LIKE A BAD CLUSTER TO THE SYSTEM.  IT'S  NEVER  EVEN\nNOTICED.  WHEN THE TIME COMES, IT AWAKENS THE SECOND PART OF  THE\nVIRUS, 7610013.EXE WHICH IS SAVED IN A HIDDEN DIRECTORY AND LOOKS\nLIKE  BAD  SECTORS.  ONLY A FEW K.  THAT'S THE FILE  THAT  SCREWS\nAROUND WITH 123 MATH FUNCTIONS.  AFTER 123 IS INFECTED, THE  FILE\nLENGTH  STILL  SAYS IT HASN'T BEEN CHANGED AND THE  VIRUS  ERASES\nITSELF  AND  RETURNS THE SECTORS TO THE DISK.  IN  THE  MEANTIME,\nLOTUS IS SHOT AND IT IS INFECTING OTHER PROGRAMS.  BRILLIANT IF I\nSAY SO MYSELF.\n\nAnd you want me to print this?  Why?\n\nIT WILL GIVE YOU AND ME CREDIBILITY.  YOU'LL BE BELIEVED AND THAT\nIS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.  WE HAVE TO STOP IT FROM HAPPENING.\n\nWhat from happening?\n\nTHE FULL ATTACK.  IT CAN'T BE TOTALLY STOPPED, BUT I CAN HELP.\n\nHow much of an attack?\n\nYOU  HAVE  NO  IDEA.  NO IDEA AT ALL.  THERE  WERE  THOUSANDS  OF\nPEOPLE  INVOLVED  AND NOW IT'S ON AUTOPILOT.  THERE'S NO  WAY  TO\nTURN IT OFF.\n\nThat's  incredible  . . .more than incredible.   Why?   For  what\npurpose?\n\nMAYBE LATER.  THAT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.  I WILL SAY, THOUGH,  THAT\nI NEVER THOUGHT HOMOSOTO COULD PULL IT OFF.\n\nSo you worked for him?\n\nI  WAS  HIRED BY OSO INDUSTRIES TO WORK ON A SECRET  CONTRACT  TO\nDESIGN  METHODS  TO COMBAT COMPUTER VIRUSES  AND  STUDY  MILITARY\nAPPLICATIONS.   AS THE PROJECT CONTINUED, IT TOOK ON A NEW  SCOPE\nAND  WE WERE ASKED TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS AND  CONSIDERA-\nTIONS IN OUR EQUATIONS.\n\nEquations?\n\nCOMPUTER  DESIGN  IS MATHEMATICAL MODELING, SO THERE'S A  LOT  OF\nPENCIL  AND PAPER BEFORE ANYTHING IS EVER BUILT.  WE FIGURED  THE\nEFFECTS  OF MULTIPLE SEQUENCED VIRUSES ON LIMITED TARGET  DEFINI-\nTIONS, COMPUTER SOFTWARE DISTRIBUTION DYNAMICS, DATA  PROPAGATION\nPROBABILITIES.    OUR  CALCULATIONS  INCLUDED   MULTI-DIMENSIONAL\nINTERACTIONS  OF INFECTION SIMULTANEITY.  EVERY  POSSIBILITY  AND\nHOW TO CAUSE THE MOST DAMAGE.\n\nIt's  a good thing I kind of understand the  technical  gobbledy-\ngook.\n\nOH,  IN ENGLISH?  WE STUDIED WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ENDLESSLY  THROW\nTHOUSANDS OF COMPUTER VIRUSES AT THE UNITED STATES.\n\nI got that.  So what does happen?\n\nYOU'RE FUCKED FOR LIFE.  ONE VIRUS IS A PAIN IN THE ASS.  1000 IS\nFATAL.\n\nYou have a way with words.\n\nGOD  GIVEN  GIFT.   I GUESS YOU COULD CALL US A  THINK  TANK  FOR\nCOMPUTER WARFARE.\n\nSo what happens next Mr. Spook?\n\nPATRONIZING, NOW, NOW, NOW.  LET'S SEE HERE (FLIP, FLIP)   SATUR-\nDAY,  JANUARY 23, NO, THAT WAS THE STOCK EXCHANGE,   NO  DECEMBER\n11, THE PHONE COMPANY AND FEDERAL EXPRESS . . .\n\nCocky son of a bitch aren't you?\n\nAH  YES!   HERE IT IS.  MONDAY, JANUARY  25.   SCOTT,  YOU'RE  MY\nFRIEND,  SO LET ME GIVE YOU A TIP.  DON'T TRY TAKING AN  AIRPLANE\nFOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.\n\nWhy not?\n\nTHE NATIONAL RESERVATION SERVICE COMPUTERS ARE GOING TO BE  VERY,\nVERY SICK.\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Yeah,\" the deep sleepy voice growled in Scott's ear.\n\n\"Ty, wake up.\"\n\n\"Wha?\"\n\n\"Tyrone, get up!\"  Scott's excited voice caught Tryone's notice.\n\n\"Scott,\" he yawned.  \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"Are you awake?\"\n\n\"Don't  worry, I had to get up to answer the phone.\"  Then  in  a\nmore  muffled voice Scott heard Tyrone say, \"no, it's  all  right\ndear.   Go back to sleep, I'll take it in the den.\"   Tyrone  got\nback on the phone and barked, \"hold on.\"\n\nScott  paced across his junked up home office, sidestepping  some\nitems, stepping on others, until Tyrone came back on the line.\n\n\"Shit, man,\" were Tyrone's first words.  \"You have any idea  what\ntime it is?\"\n\n\"Hey,  I'm sorry,\" Scott said mocking Tyrone's complaint.   \"I'll\nwrite  you  a letter tomorrow and lick a stamp and let  the  Post\nOffice take it from there . . .\"\n\n\"You made your point.  What is it?\"\n\n\"The airlines are going to be hit next.  Homosoto's next target.\"\n\n\"How the hell would you know that?\"\n\n\"I've been talking to Foster.  He told me.\"\n\n\"Foster told you what?\"\n\n\"It's  a  huge attack, an incredibly large computer  attack.   He\nworked  for Homosoto.  But the point is, the  airlines.   They're\nnext.  Worse than the radar computer problems.\"\n\n\"Can I get right back to you?\"\n\nWaiting  for Ty's call, Scott wrote an article for the  following\nmorning's paper and submitted it from home to the office  comput-\ner.\n\n* * * * *\n\n                         COMPUTER TERRORISM\n     An  Exclusive  Interview With The Man Who Invaded America\n     By Scott Mason\n\nThe  man who claims to be the technical genius behind the  recent\nwave of Computer Crimes has agreed to tell his story  exclusively\nto the New York City Times.\n\nOnly known as the Spook, a hacker's handle which represents  both\nan  alter-ego  and anonymity, he says that he was hired  by  Taki\nHomosoto, late chairman of OSO Industries to design and prepare a\nmassive  assault  against  the computer  systems  of  the  United\nStates.\n\nThe incredible claims made by the Spook appear to be grounded  in\nfact  and  his first statements alone  were  astounding.   Please\nnote,  these are exact quotes from a computer  conversation  with\nthe Spook.\n\n\"There will be thousands of viruses.  Thousands of them.  I  have\nto imagine by now that every program in America is infected  with\nten  different viruses.  There is only one way to stop them  all.\nNever turn on your computers.\n\n\"You  see,  most virus programmers are  searching  for  immediate\ngratification.   They write one and want it to spread real  quick\nand  then  see it blow up.  So most amateur  virus  builders  are\ndisappointed  in  the results because they don't  have  patience.\nBut we, I had patience.\n\n\"To maximize the effects of viruses, you have to give them  time.\nTime  to  spread, to infect.  Many of the viruses that  you  will\nexperience are years old.  The older viruses are much cruder than\nthose  made recently.  We learned over time to build  better  vi-\nruses.  Our old ones have been dormant for so long, their  conta-\ngion is complete and they will be just as effective.\n\n\"We  have built and installed the greatest viruses of  all  time.\nEvery PC will probably be dead in months if not weeks, unless you\ntake  my  advice.  There are also VAX viruses, VMS  viruses,  SUN\nviruses, we even built some for Cray supercomputers, but we don't\nexpect much damage from them.\"\n\nThe Spook's next comments were just as startling.\n\n\"The blackmail operation was a sham, but a terrific success.   It\nwasn't for the money.  No one ever collected any money, did they?\nIt was pure psychological warfare.  Making people distrust  their\ncomputers,  distrust one another because the computer makes  them\nlook like liars.  That was the goal.  The money was a  diversion-\nary tactic.\n\n\"Part of any attack is the need to soften the enemy and terrorism\nis  the  best way to get quick results.  By the  time  the  first\nviruses  came along, whoa!  I bet half the MIS directors  in  the\ncountry don't know whether they're coming or going.\"\n\nAccording  to  the  Spook, he designed the  attack  with  several\narmies to be used for different purposes.\n\nOne  for Propaganda, one for Infiltration and Infection, one  for\nEngineering, one for Communications, and another for Distribution\nand  another  for Manufacturing.  At the  pinnacle  was  Homosoto\nacting as Command and Control.\n\n\"I didn't actually infect any computers myself.  We had teams  of\nGroundhogs all too happy to do that for us.\"\n\nAccording  to  security experts, Homosoto apparently  employed  a\ncomplex set of military stratagem in the execution of his attack.\n\nIt  has yet to be determined if the Spook will be of any help  in\nminimizing the effects of the First Computer War.\n\nScott finally went to bed.  Tyrone never called him back.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Thursday, January 21\n     New York City\n\nThe  cavernous  streets of New York on a cloud  covered  moonless\nnight  harbor an eerie aura, reminiscent of the fog laden  alleys\nnear  the  London  docks on the Thames in the days  of  Jack  the\nRipper.   A  constant misty rain gave the city an even  more  de-\npressing  pallor than winter normally brought to the  Big  Apple.\nIn other words, the weather was perfect.\n\nOn  the corner of 52nd. and 3rd., in the shadow of  the  Citibank\ntower,  Dennis  Melbourne stuck a magnetic strip ID card  into  a\nCirrus 24 Hour Bank Teller Machine.  As the machine sucked in the\ncard,  the  small screen asked for  the  personal  identification\nnumber,  the PIN, associated with that particular  card.   Dennis\nentered the requested four digit PIN, 1501.   The teller  whirred\nand asked Dennis which transaction he would like.\n\nHe selected:\n\n     Checking Balance.\n\nA few seconds later  $4,356.20 appeared.  Good, Dennis thought.\n\nHe then selected:\n\n     Withdrawal - Checking\n\nDennis  entered, $2,000.00 and the machine display told him  that\nhis  request  exceeded the daily withdrawal  limit.   Normal,  he\nthought, as he entered an 8 digit sequence: 00330101.  The super-\nvisor control override.\n\nThe  teller hummed and thought for a moment, and then  $20  bills\nbegan  tumbling  out of the \"Take Cash\" drawer.  One  hundred  of\nthem.\n\nThe teller asked, \"Another Transaction?\"  and Dennis chose  'No'.\nHe  retrieved the magnetic card from the machine and the  receipt\nof this transaction before grabbing a cab to a subway entrance on\n59th. and Lexington Ave.   The ID card he used was only  designed\nto  be used once, so Dennis saw to it that the card was  cut  and\ndisposed of in a subterranean men's room toilet.\n\nDennis  Melbourne  traveled throughout New York all  night  long,\nemptying Cirrus cash machines of their available funds.  And  the\nnext night, and the next.  He netted $246,300 in three days.  All\ntold, Cirrus customers in thirty-six states were robbed by Dennis\nMelbourne  and  his scores of accomplices of nearly  $10  Million\nbefore the banks discovered how it was being done.\n\nThe  Cirrus network and it's thousands of Automatic Tellers  were\nimmediately closed.   For the first time in years, America had no\naccess to instant cash.\n\nBank  lines  grew to obscene lengths and the waiting  for  simple\ntransactions  was  interminable.   Almost one  half  of  personal\nbanking had been done by ATM computer, and now human tellers  had\nto  deal with throngs of customers who had little idea of how  to\nbank with a live person.\n\nRetail  sales  figures for the week after the ATM  machines  were\nclosed  showed a significant decline of 3.2%.  The  Commerce  De-\npartment  was demanding action by Treasury who pressured the  FBI\nand  everybody  looked to the White House  for  leadership.   The\neconomic impact of immediate cash restriction had been  virtually\ninstantaneous;  after  all the U.S. is a culture  of  spontaneity\ndemanding  instant  gratification. Cash machines  addressed  that\ncultural personality perfectly.  Now it was gone.\n\nDennis  Melbourne  knew  that it was time to begin  on  the  MOST\nnetwork.   Then the American Express network.  And he  would  get\nrich in the process.  Ahmed Shah paid him very well.  25% of  the\ntake.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday, January 22\n     New York City\n\n\"We had to take out the part about the airlines,\" Higgins said in\nresponse  to Scott's question about the heavy editing.   To  Hig-\ngins'  and Doug's surprise, Scott understood; he didn't put up  a\nstink.\n\n\"I  wondered about that,\" Scott said reflecting back on the  last\nevening.  \"Telling too much can be worse than not telling enough.\nWhatever you say, John.\"\n\n\"We decided to let the airlines and the FAA and the NTSB make the\ncall.\"  Higgins and Scott had come to know and respect each other\nquite  well in the last few weeks.  They didn't agree  on  every-\nthing,  but  as the incredible story evolved, Higgins  felt  more\ncomfortable with less conservative rulings and Scott relinquished\nhis  non-negotiable pristine attitude.  At least  they  disagreed\nless often and less loudly.  Although neither one would admit it,\neach made an excellent sounding board for the other - a  valuable\nasset on a story this important.\n\nHiggins  continued.   \"The  airlines are treating it  as  a  bomb\nscare.   Seriously, but quietly.  They have people going  through\nthe  systems,  looking for whatever it is you people  look  for.\"\nHiggins' knowledge of computers was still dismal.\n\n\"Scott, let me ask you something.\" Doug broke into the  conversa-\ntion that like all the others, took place in Higgins' lawyer-like\noffice.   They  occurred so often that Scott had  half  seriously\nconvinced Higgins' secretary that he wouldn't attend unless there\nwere  fresh donuts and juice on the coffee table.   When  Higgins\nfound out,  he was mildly annoyed, but nonetheless, in the spirit\nof camaraderie, he let the tradition continue.  \"Children will be\nchildren,\" he said.\n\n\"How much damage could be done if the Spook's telling the truth?\"\nDoug asked.\n\n\"Oh,  he's telling the truth,\" Scott said somberly.  \"Don't  for-\nget, I know this guy.  He said that the effects would take  weeks\nand  maybe  months to straighten out.  And  the  airline  assault\nwould start Monday.\"\n\n\"Why is he being so helpful?\"  Higgins asked.\n\n\"He  wants  to establish credibility.  He says he wants  to  help\nnow, but first he wants to be taken seriously.\"\n\n\"Seriously? Seriously?  He's a terrorist!\" shouted Higgins.   \"No\ndamn  different  than someone who throws a bomb  into  a  crowded\nsubway.   You don't negotiate with terrorists!\"  He  calmed  him-\nself,  not liking to show that degree of emotion.  \"But  we  want\nthe story . . .\" he sighed in resignation.  Doug and Scott agreed\nin unison.\n\n\"Personally, it sounds like a macho ego thing,\" commented Doug.\n\n\"So what?\" asked Higgins.  \"Motivation is independent of premedi-\ntation.\"\n\n\"Legally  speaking  . . .\"  Doug added.  He wanted to  make  sure\nthan  John  was  aware that there were other  than  purely  legal\nissues on the table.\n\n\"As  I was saying,\" Scott continued.  \"The reservation  computers\nare  the single most important item in running the nation's  air-\nlines.   They  all interact and talk to each  other,  and  create\nbilling,  and  schedule  planes; they interface on  line  to  the\nOAG . . .they're the brains.  They all use Fault Tolerant  equip-\nment, that's spares of everything, off site backup of all records\n-  I've checked into it.  Whatever he's planned, it'll be a  doo-\nsey.\"\n\n\"Well,  it doesn't matter now,\" Higgins added with  indifference.\n\"Legally  it's  unsubstantiated hearsay.  But with  the  computer\ntranscripts  of all your conversations, if anything happens,  I'd\nsay you'd have quite a scoop.\"\n\n\"That's what he wants!  And we can't warn anybody?\"\n\n\"That's  up to the airlines, the FAA, not us.\" The phone on  Hig-\ngins  disk emitted two short warbles.  He spoke into  the  phone.\n\"Yeah?  Who? Whooo?\"  He held the phone out to Scott  and  curled\nhis lips.  \"It's for you.  The White House.\"  Scott glanced  over\nat Doug who raised his bushy white eyebrows.\n\nScott picked up the phone on the end table by the leather  couch;\nthe  one that Scott seemed to have made a second home.   \"Hello?\"\nhe   asked   hesitantly.    \"Yes?    Well,   I   could   be    in\nWashington   . . .\" Scott looked over to Doug for  advice.   \"The\nPresident?\"  Doug shook his head, yes.  Whatever it is, go.  \"I'd\nbe  happy  to,\" he said reading his watch.  \"A  few  hours?\"   He\nwaited a few seconds.  \"Yes, I know the number.  Off the  record?\nFine.  Thank you.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Higgins.\n\n\"The President himself wants to have a little chat with me.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday, January 22\n     The White House\n\nOnly the President, Musgrave and Henry Kennedy were there to meet\nScott.   They  did not want to overwhelm him, merely  garner  his\ncooperation.  Scott rushed by cab to the White House from Nation-\nal  Airport,  and used the Press Gate even though he had  an  ap-\npointment  with  The Man.  He could have used the  Visitor's  En-\ntrance.    Scott  was  whisked by White  House  aides  through  a\n\"Private\"  door in the press room to the surprise of the  regular\npool  reporters who wondered who dared to so  underdress.   Defi-\nnitely not from Washington.\n\nScott  was  running on short notice, so he was only  wearing  his\nwork  clothes: torn blue jeans, a sweatshirt from the nude  beach\nhe and Sonja had visited and Reeboks that needed a wash.  January\nwas unusually warm, so he got away with wearing his denim  jacket\nfilled  with  a  decade of patches  reflecting  Scott's  evolving\npolitical and social attitudes.  He was going to have to bring  a\nchange of clothes to the office from now on.\n\nBefore he had a chance to apologize for his appearance, at  least\nhe was able to shave the three day old stubble on the train,  the\nPresident  apologized for the suddenness and hoped it wasn't  too\nmuch of an inconvenience.  Kennedy and Musgrave kept their smirks\nto  themselves, knowing full well from the very complete  dossier\non  Scott Mason, that he was having a significant intimate  rela-\ntionship  with  one Sonja Lindstrom, here  in  Washington.   Very\nconvenient was more like it, they thought.\n\nThe  President sat Scott down on the Queen Anne and  complimented\nhim  on  his series of articles on computer crime. He  said  that\nScott  was doing a fine job awakening the public to the  problem,\nand that more people should care, and how brave he was to jump in\nfront of flying bullets, and on and on and on.  Due to Henry  and\nPhil's  political savvy and professional discipline,  neither  of\ntheir faces showed that they both wanted to throw up on the spot.\nThis  was  worse  than kissing babies to get  elected.   But  the\nPresident  of  the  United States wanted a secret  favor  from  a\njournalist, so some softening, some schmoozing was in order.\n\n\"Well, let me get right to the point,\" the President said a  half\nhour  later after two cups of coffee and endless small talk  with\nScott.   He, too, had wondered what the President wanted so  much\nthat  the extended foreplay was necessary.  \"I understand  Scott,\nthat you have developed quite a rapport with this Spook  fellow.\"\nHe held up a copy of the New York paper headlines blaring:\n\n          Computer Terrorism - Exclusive.\n\nAha!  So that's what they want! They want me to turn him in.   \"I\nconsider  myself  to be very lucky, right place, right  time  and\nall.   Yessir.\"   Scott downplayed his position  with  convincing\nhumility.  \"It seems as if he has selected me as his mouthpiece.\"\n\n\"All  we want, in fact, all we can ask,\" Musgrave said,  \"is  for\nyou  to  give us information before it's printed.\"  Scott's  eyes\nshot  up  in defense, protest at the ready.   \"No,  no,\"  Mugrave\nadded quickly.  \"Nothing confidential.  We know that Miles Foster\nis the Spook, but we can't prove it without giving away away  too\nmany of our secrets.\" Scott knew they were referring to their own\nelectronic  eavesdropping  habits that would be  imprudent  in  a\ncourt.   \"Single handedly he is capable of bringing down half  of\nthe government's computers.  We need to know as much as we can as\nfast as we can.  So, whatever you print, we'd like an early  copy\nof it.  That's all.\"\n\nScott's mind immediately traveled back to the first and only time\nan article of his was pulled.  At the AG's request.  Of course it\nfinally  got  printed, but why the niceties now?  They  can  take\nwhat  they want, but instead they ask?  Maybe they don't want  to\nget caught fiddling around with the Press too much.  Such activi-\nties  snagged  Nixon, not saying that the  President  was  Nixon-\nesque,  but politics is politics.   What do I get in return?   He\ncould  hear it now, the '<MI>you'll be helping your  country,<D>'\nspeech.   Bargaining  with the President would be gauche  at  the\nleast.\n\nSo  he proposed to Musgrave instead. \"I want an exclusive  inter-\nview with the President when this thing is over.\"\n\n\"Done!\" said Musgrave too quickly.  Scott immediately  castigated\nhimself for not asking for more.  He could shoot himself.  A true\nWashington  denizen would have asked for a seat in  the  Cabinet.\nBut that was between Scott and his conscience.  Doug would hear a\ndramatized account.\n\n\"And no other media finds out that you know anything until . . .\"\nScott added another minor demand.\n\n\"Until the morning papers appear at the back door with the milk,\"\njoked  Musgrave.  \"Scott, this is for internal use  only.   Every\nhour will help.\"\n\nScott  was given a secret White House phone number where  someone\nwould either receive FAX or E-Mail message. Not the standard  old\nPRESIDENT@WHITEHOUSE.GOV  that any schmo with a PC  could  E-mail\ninto.  His was special. Any hour, any day.  He was also  given  a\nWhite House souvenir pen.\n\n\"It  went  fine,\" Kennedy said to Marvin Jacobs from  his  secure\noffice  in the White House basement.   He spoke to Marvin  Jacobs\nup at Fort Meade on the STU-III phones.\n\n\"Didn't matter,\" Marvin said munching on what sounded to  Kennedy\nlike an apple. A juicy one.\n\n\"What do you mean, it didn't matter?\"\n\n\"We're  listening to his computers, his phones and his fax  lines\nanyway,\"  Marvin said with neutrality.\n\n\"I don't know if I want to know about this . . .\"\n\n\"It  was just a back up plan,\"  Jacobs said with a little  laugh.\nHe  wanted  to  defuse Kennedy's panic button.   For  a  National\nSecurity Advisor, Kennedy didn't know very much about how  intel-\nligence is gathered.  \"Just in case.\"\n\n\"Well, we don't need it anymore,\" Kennedy said.  \"Mason is  coop-\nerating fully.\"\n\n\"I  like  to have alternatives.  I expect you'll be  telling  the\nPresident about this.\"\n\n\"Not a chance.  Not a chance.\"  Kennedy sounded spooked.\n\nJacobs  loudly  munched  the last bite through  the  apple  skin.\n\"I'll have something else for you on Mason tomorrow.  Let's  keep\nhim honest.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday, January 22\n     Reston, Virginia\n\n\"No, mom, I'm not going to become a spy,\" Scott calmly said  into\nthe  phone while smiling widely at Sonja.  \"No, I can't tell  you\nwhat  he  wanted, but he did give me a present for  you.\"   Scott\nmouthed the words, 'she's in heaven' to Sonja who enjoyed  seeing\nthe  pleasure the woman received from her son's  travels.   \"Yes,\nI'll  be  home  in a couple of days,\"  he paused  as  his  mother\ninterrupted  again.  \"Yes, I'll be happy to reprogram  your  VCR.\nI'm sorry it doesn't work . . .\"  He sat back to listen for a few\nseconds and watch Sonja undress in front of a full length mirror.\nTheir guests were expected in less than 15 minutes and she rushed\nto  make  herself beautiful despite Scott's claims that  she  was\nalways beautiful.   \"Yes, mom, I'm paying attention. No ma'am,  I\nwon't.  Yes, ma'am, I'll try.  O.K., goodnight, I love you.\"   He\nstruggled  to  pull the phone from his ear, but his  mother  kept\ntalking.  \"Don't worry, mom.  You'll meet her soon.\"  Finally  he\nwas  able  hang up and start worrying about one of  their  dinner\nguests.  Miles Foster.\n\nScott had told Sonja nothing about Miles.  Or the Spook.  As  far\nas  the world was concerned, they were two different people  with\ndifferent goals, different motivations and different lives.   The\nunresolved  irreconcilliation  between  the two  faces  of  Miles\nFoster put Scott on edge, though.  Does he treat Miles like Miles\nor  like the Spook?  Or is the Spook coming to dinner instead  of\nMiles.   Does  he  then treat the Spook like the  Spook  or  like\nMiles?\n\nIn kind, Sonja had not told Scott that she had been hired to meet\nhim,  nor that she had quit after meeting him.  The  night  Miles\nwas  arrested, she had successfully evaded his queries about  her\nprofessional  PR  functions. Scott accepted at  face  value  that\nSonja was between jobs.\n\nShe  had  made a lot of money from Alex and his  references,  but\nthat was the past.  She had no desire to be dishonest with Scott,\non  the contrary.  It was not an easy topic to  broach,  however,\nand if things between them got beyond the frenzied sexual savage-\nry stage, she would have to test the relationship.  But not yet.\n\nThe doorbell of Sonja's lakefront Whisper Way townhouse in Reston\nrang before either she or Scott were ready, so Scott  volunteered\nfor first shift host and bartender duty.  He took a deep  breath,\nready for another unpredictable evening, and opened the door.\n\n\"Scott,\" Stephanie Perkins said putting her arms around his neck.\n\"Welcome  back.   It's  good to see you.\"   The  three  of  them,\nStephanie,  Sonja and Scott had gotten along very  well.   \"Maybe\nMiles  can see his way clear to spend the entire evening with  us\ntonight,\" she said teasing Miles.\n\nMiles  ignored Perky's shot at him and brushed it  aside  without\ncomment.  Apparently he had provided Stephanie with an acceptable\nexcuse for getting arrested by the FBI.  So be it far from  Scott\nto  bring  up a subject that might ruffle the  romantic  feathers\nwhich in turn were likely to ruffle the feathers of his source.\n\nMiles  dressed in summer khaki pants, a  yachtsman's  windbreaker\nand  topsiders  without  socks; the most casual  Scott  had  seen\neither the Spook or Miles.  Scott prepared the drinks and Stepha-\nnie went upstairs with her glass of wine to see Sonja and let the\nboys  finish  their shop talk.   Miles opened the  sliding  glass\ndoors to the deck overlooking the fairly large man-made lake.\n\n\"I won't ask,\" Scott said as soon as Stephanie's feet disappeared\nfrom view on the elegant spiral staircase to the second floor.\n\n\"Thanks.   And, by the way, Perky probably doesn't need  to  hear\ntoo  much  about Amsterdam,\" Miles said with  a  mildly  sinister\ntouch.\n\n\"We used to call it the rules of the road,\" Scott remembered.\n\n\"I call it survival.  Christ, sometimes I get so fucking horny, I\nswear the crack of dawn is in trouble.\"\n\nScott's  mind played with the varied imagery of  Miles'  creative\nphraseology.  The name was different, he thought, but the charac-\nter was the same.\n\n\"You  know,\" Scott said as the two stood on the deck,  drinks  in\nhand, soaking up the brisk lake air.  \"I really don't  understand\nyou.\"\n\n\"What's  to understand?\"  Miles' gaze remained constant over  the\nmoonlit water.\n\n\"I see that you weren't overly detained the other evening.\"\n\n\"No reason to be.  It was a terrible mistake.  They must have  me\nconfused with someone else.\"  Miles played dead pan.\n\n\"You  know what I'm talking about,\" urged Scott.  \"The Spook  and\nall that  . . .\"\n\n\"Fuck  you!\"  Miles turned and yelled with hostility.  He  placed\nthe glass of Glenfiddich on the railing and pointed his  forefin-\nger in Scott's face.  \"You're getting what you want, so back  the\nfuck off.  Got it?\"\n\nScott's  blood  pressure joined his fight or flight  response  in\npanic.   Was  this  the Mr. Hyde of Miles Foster?   Or  the  real\nSpook?  Had he blown it?\n\nJust then, the sliding glass door from the living room opened and\nSonja  and  Stephanie shivered at the first cool  gust  of  wind.\nMiles  instantly  swept  Stephanie in his arms and  gave  her  an\nobscene sounding kiss.  His face emerged from the lip melee  with\nno  trace of anger, no trace of displeasure.  The sinister  Miles\nwas magically transformed into Miles the lover.\n\nHe had had no chance to respond to Miles' outburst, so Scott  was\ncaught with his jaw hung open.\n\n\"You  boys finish shop yet?\"  Stephanie said nuzzling  at  Miles'\near.\n\n\"We were just discussing the biographical inconsistencies in  the\nannotated  history  of Alfred E. Neumann's early  years,\"   Miles\nsaid convincingly.  He glanced over at Scott with a wise cracking\ndimple  filled  smile.   \"We disagree on the exact  date  of  his\nsecond bris.\"\n\nIncredible, thought Scott.  The ultimate chameleon.\n\nGullibility  was one of Stephanie's long suits, so  Sonja  helped\nout.   \"That's  right  up there with the bathing  habits  of  the\nJamaican bobsled team.\"\n\n\"C'mon,\"  Stephanie  said  tugging at Miles.   \"It's  chilly  out\nhere.\"\n\nDumbfounded,  Scott  shrugged  at Miles when  the  girls  weren't\nlooking.  Whatever you want.  It's your game.  Miles mouthed back\nat Scott, 'you're fucking right it is.'\n\nThe  remainder of the evening comprised a little  of  everything.\nExcept  computers.  And computer crime.  And any  political  talk\nthat  might lead to either of the first two no-nos.   They  dined\nelegantly,  drank expensive French wine and overindulged in  Mar-\ntel.  It was the perfect social evening between four friends.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         Chapter 28\n\n     Sunday, January 24\n     New York City Times\n\n     HARDWARE VIRUSES: A NEW TWIST\n     By Scott Mason\n\nIn  conversations  with the Spook, the man who claims to  be  the\ntechnical  genius  behind the Homosoto Invasion, I  have  learned\nthat there are even more menacing types of computer viruses  than\nthose commonly associated with infected software programs.   They\nare  hardware viruses; viruses built right into the  electronics.\nThe  underground  computer culture calls the elite  designers  of\nhardware  viruses Chippers.  It should come as no  surprise  then\nthat  Chipping was a practice exploited by Homosoto and his  band\nunder the wizardry of the Spook.\n\nChippers  are a very specialized group of what I would have  once\ncalled  hackers, but whom now many refer to as terrorists.   They\ndesign  and build integrated circuits, chips, the brains of  toys\nand  computers, to purposefully malfunction.  The chips  are  de-\nsigned to either simply stop working, cause intentional random or\npersistent  errors and even cause physical damage to other  elec-\ntronic circuits.\n\nYou ask, is all of this really possible?  Yes, it is possible, it\nis occurring right now, and there is good reason to suspect  that\nhuge  numbers  of electronic VCR's,  cameras,  microwaves,  clock\nradios and military systems are a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nIt  takes  a great many resources to build a chip -  millions  of\ndollars  in  sophisticated test equipment, lasers,  clean  rooms,\nelectron beam microscopes and dozens of PhD's in dozens of disci-\nplines to run it all.\n\nAccording  to  the  Spook,  OSO Industries  built  millions  upon\nmillions of integrated circuits that are programmed to fail.   He\nsaid,  \"I  personally headed up that portion of  the  engineering\ndesign  team.   The  techniques for  building  and  disguising  a\nTrojan  Chip were all mine.  I originally suggested  the idea  in\njest,  saying  that  if someone really wanted  to  cause  damage,\nthat's  what  they would do.  Homosoto didn't even blink  at  the\ncost.  Twelve million dollars.\"\n\nWhen  asked  if  he knew when the chips would  start  failing  he\nresponded,  \"I  don't know the exact dates because  anyone  could\neasily add or change a date or event trigger.  But I would  guess\nthat based upon timing of the other parts of the plan,  seemingly\nisolated  electronic systems will begin to fail in the  next  few\nmonths.  But, that's only a guess.\"\n\nThe  most damaging types of Trojan Chips are those  that  already\nhave  a lot of room for memory.  The Spook described  how  mostly\nstatic  RAM, (Random Access Memory) chips and various ROM  chips,\n(Read Only Memory) such as UV-EPROM and EEPROM were used to house\nthe  destructive instructions for later release in computer  sys-\ntems.\n\n\"It's really simple.  There are always thousands of unused  gates\nin every IC.  Banks and banks of memory for the taking.  Homosoto\nwas  no slouch, and he recognized that hardware viruses  are  the\nultimate  in underground computer warfare.  Even better than  the\noriginal  Trojan  Horse.  No messy software to worry  about,  and\nextensive  collateral  damage to  nearby  electronic  components.\nMakes repairs terrifically expensive.\"\n\nWhich chips are to be considered suspect?  The Spook was clear.\n\n\"Any  RAM  or ROM chips with the OSO logo and a date  code  after\n1/89  are  potentially  dangerous.  They should  be  swapped  out\nimmediately for new, uninfected components.  Also, OSO sold their\nchips, in die form, to other manufacturers to put their own names\non them.  I wish I  knew to whom, but Homosoto's firm handled all\nof that.\"\n\nThe Spook also said to beware of any electronic device using  OSO\nlabeled or OSO made LS logic chips.   Hundreds of millions of the\nLS logic chips, the so called Glue of electronics, are sold every\nyear.  In the electronics world they are considered  'dime-store'\nparts,  selling for a few pennies each.  However, in  most  elec-\ntronic  systems, an inexpensive component failure is just as  bad\nas  an  expensive component failure.  In either  case,  it  stops\nworking.\n\nThe  Spook  continues:  \"The idea was to build a  small  timebomb\ninto  VCR's,  televisions and radios.  Not  only  computers,  but\nalarm  systems,  cash registers, video games, blowing up  all  at\nonce. At times it got very funny. Imagine dishwashers spitting up\ngallons of suds in kitchens everywhere.  The ovens will be  cook-\ning  pork tartar and toast a la burnt.  What happens when  Betty-\nJean doesn't trust her appliances any more?    The return line at\nSears will be a week long.\"\n\nI  asked the Spook how this was possible?  How could  he  inflict\nsuch damage without anyone noticing?  His answer is as  indicting\nas  is  his  guilt.  \"No one checks.  If the chip  passes  a  few\nsimple  tests, it's put into a calculator or a clock or  a  tele-\nphone  or  an  airplane.  No one expects the chip  to  be  hiding\nsomething  destructive,  so no one looks for it.   Not  even  the\nmilitary  check.   They just expect their chips to  work  in  the\nfrozen  depths of space and survive a nuclear blast.  They  don't\nexpect a virus to be lurking.\"\n\nNo  matter what one thinks of the nameless, faceless  person  who\nhides behind the anonymity of these computerized confessions, one\nhas  to agree that the man known as the Spook has  awakened  this\nworld to many of the dangers that unbridled technical proficiency\nbrings.   Have we taken too much liberty without the  concomitant\nresponsibility?   I know that I find I wish I could run parts  of\nmy  life  in fast forward.  Sitting in a movie  theater,  I  feel\nmyself tense as I realize I cannot speed up the slow parts.   Has\nthe infinite flexibility we have given ourselves outpaced  social\nconscience?\n\nIronically, conversations with the Spook tended to be impersonal;\nnot machine-like, but devoid of concern for people.  I asked  him\nif he cared.\n\n\"That  was  not the idea, as far as I know.  In a  way  this  was\nelectronic  warfare, in the true sense of the  word.   Collateral\ndamage is unavoidable.\"\n\nHardware  viruses  in addition to software viruses.   Is  nothing\nsacred?\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Sunday, January 24\n     Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Does he know what he's saying?\"  Henry Kennedy said doubtfully.\n\n\"I think so, and I also think it's a brilliant way to put a  huge\ndent  in the Japanese monopoly on integrated  circuits.\"   Marvin\nJacobs  had an office installed not two doors from  Kennedy's  in\nthe subterranean mazes beneath the White House lawn.\n\n\"He can't blame the Japanese for everything.\"\n\n\"Don't  you see? He's not?  All he's saying is that OSO  did  it,\nand he's letting the Japanese national guilt by association  take\nits  course.\"   Jacobs seemed pleased.   \"Mason's  chippers  will\ncast  a shadow of doubt on everything electronic made  in  Japan.\nIf it has OSO's name on it, it'll be taboo.  Toshiba, Mitsubishi,\nMatsushita  . . .all the big Nippon names will be  tarnished  for\nyears.\"\n\n\"And you actually want this to happen?\" asked Henry.\n\n\"I  didn't say that,\" Marvin said slithering away from  a  policy\nopinion.   \"Hey, what are you complaining about?  Mason  gave  us\nthe article like you wanted, didn't he?\"\n\n\"I told you there were other ways,\"  Kennedy shot back.\n\n\"Well, for your information, there's a little more that he didn't\ntell us about,\" said Jacobs haughtily.\n\n\"And how did you find out?  Pray tell?\"\n\nMarvin  grinned  devilishly before answering.   \"CMR.   Van  Eck.\nWhatever.  We have Mason covered.\"\n\n\"You're using the same . . .\"\n\n\"Which is exactly how we're going to fight these bastards.\"\n\n\"At the expense of privacy?\"\n\n\"There is no clear cut legal status of electromagnetic emanations\nfrom computers,\" Marv said defensively.  \"Are they private?   Are\nthey free to anyone with a receiver, like a radio or TV?  No  one\nhas tested the theory yet.  And that's not to say we've tried  to\npublicize it.  The FCC ruled in 1990 that eavesdropping on cellu-\nlar telephone calls was legal.  By anyone, even the  government.\"\nMarvin was giving a most questionable technical practice an  aura\nof  respectability  hidden  behind the legal  guise  of  freedom.\nKennedy  was uncomfortable with the situation, but in this  case,\nMarv had the President's ear.\n\n\"And screw privacy, right? All in the name of national security.\"\nHenry did not approve of Marvin's tactics.\n\n\"It's  been  done before and it'll be done  again,\"  Marvin  said\nfairly unconcerned with Kennedy's opinions and whining.   \"Citing\nNational   Security   is   a   great   antidote   to    political\ninconvenience.\"\n\n\"I  don't agree with you, not one iota!\" blasted Kennedy.   \"This\nis a democracy, and with that comes the good and the bad, and one\npremise  of  a democracy is the right to  privacy.   That's  what\nshredded Nixon.  Phone taps, all the time, phone taps.\"\n\n\"Henry,  Henry,\"  begged Marv to his old time, but  more  liberal\nminded  friend.  \"This is legal.\"  Marvin's almost  wicked  smile\nwas not contagious.  \"It's not illegal either.\"\n\nKennedy  frown  deeply.  \"I think you take the NSA's  charter  as\nnational listening post to an extreme,\" he said somberly.\n\n\"Henry, Are you going to fight me on this?\" Marv asked finally.\n\n\"No,\" sighed Henry Kennedy.  \"The President gave you the task,  I\nheard him, and I'm here to support his efforts.  I don't have  to\nagree . . .but it would help.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"Don't  worry.   The speech will make him sound like  an  expert,\nlike  he  actually knows what he talking about.  Not  a  man  who\nthinks Nintendo is Japanese slang for nincompoop.\" Phil  Musgrave\ncalled Henry Kennedy's office in the basement.\n\nPhil  joked with Henry about the President's legendary  technical\nineptness.  One time while giving a speech to the VFW, the  sound\nwent  out.   Trying  to be helpful, the  President  succeeded  in\nplugging  an 'in' into an 'out' which resulted in a minor  amount\nof  smoke, an embarrassing false security alert, and  the  subse-\nquent loss of any sound reinforcement at all.\n\n\"You  know how I feel about him, Phil,\" said Henry with  concern.\n\"I  support him 110%.  But this is a new area for all of us.   We\ndon't  have  the contingency plans.  Defense hasn't  spent  years\nstudying  the problem and working out the options or the  various\nscenarios.  Phil, until recently viruses and hackers were consid-\nered a non-problem in the big picture.\"\n\n\"I  know, Henry, I know, but the politicians had to rely  on  the\nexperts, and they argued and argued and procrastinated . . .\"\n\n\"And Congress, as usual, didn't do shit.\"  Kennedy completed  the\nstatement.   \"That doesn't change the fact that he's winging  it.\nChrist,  we don't even know the questions much less  the  answers\nand,   well,  we know he calls 911 to change a  lightbulb.\"   His\naffection  for the President was clear through the  barb.    \"And\nyou know what really pisses me off?\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Jacobs.  He seems pleased with the turn of events.\"\n\n\"He  should,\"  agreed Phil nonchalantly.  \"He just  won  a  major\nbattle.  He's got security back under his thumb.  A nice  politi-\ncal coup.\"\n\n\"No,  not that,\" Henry said cautiously.  \"It's just that I  think\nhe's acting too much the part of the renegade.  Do you know  what\nI mean?\"\n\n\"No,  not at all,\" laughed Phil.  \"He's just playing it his  way,\nnot anyone elses.  C'mon, now, you know that.\"\n\n\"I guess . . .\"\n\n\"Besides,  Henry,\" he said glancing at his watch.  \"It's  getting\nto  be  that time.\"   They agreed to watch the  speech  from  the\nsidelines,  so they could see how the President's  comments  were\ngreeted by the press.\n\n\"Ladies  and Gentlemen, the President of the United States.\"   An\nassistant  White House press agent made the announcement  to  the\nattendant Washington press pool.   The video was picked up by the\nCNN  cameras as it was their turn to provide a feed to the  other\nnetworks.  Sunday evening was an odd time to call a press confer-\nence,  but everyone had a pretty good idea that the  subject  was\ngoing  to  be computers.  Thus far, government  comments  on  the\ncrisis had come from everywhere but the White House.\n\nThe  President  rapidly ambled up to the podium  and  placed  his\nnotes before him.  He put on his glasses and stared at the camera\nsomberly.  It was speeches that began this way, without a  prean-\nnounced  subject matter, that caused most Americans who  grew  up\nduring  the  Cold War to experience a sinking  feeling  in  their\nstomachs.   They still thought about the unthinkable.   As  usual\nthe press corps was rapt with attention.\n\n\"Good evening,\" the President of the United States began  slowly.\n\"I am speaking to you tonight on a matter of great concern to  us\nall.   A subject of the utmost urgency to which we must   address\nourselves immediately.\n\n\"That subject is, information.  The value of information.\n\n\"As  I  am sure most of you are aware,  one man,  Taki  Homosoto,\nthreatened  the United States this last week.  It is  about  that\nvery subject that I wish to speak to the country, and the world.\"\nThe  President paused.  He had just told the country what he  was\ngoing to say.  Now he had to say it.\n\n\"For  all practical purposes, the United States is undergoing  an\nelectronic  Pearl Harbor, and the target is one of the most  cru-\ncial segments of our way of life:  Information.\n\n\"Information.  What is information?  Information is news.  Infor-\nmation  is a book, or a movie or a television show.   Information\nis  a  picture, it's a word and it's a gesture.   Information  is\nalso a thought.  A pure idea.\n\n\"Information  is the single commodity, a common denominator  upon\nwhich all industrial societies must rely.  Data, facts, opinions,\npictures, histories, records, charts, numbers.  Whether that data\nis raw in nature, such as names, addresses and phone numbers,  or\nit  consists  of secret governmental strategies and  policies  or\nproprietary  business  details, information is the  key  building\nblock upon which modern society functions.\n\n\"Information is the lifeblood of the United States and the world.\n\n\"As first steam, and then coal and then gas and oil, now informa-\ntion   has  become  an integral driving  force  of  the  economy.\nWithout  information,  our systems begin to  collapse.   How  can\nmodern  society  function without information and  the  computers\nthat  make America what it is?   Effectively there are no  longer\nany nationalistic boundaries that governments create. Information\nhas  become a global commodity.  What would our  respective  cul-\ntures look like if information was no longer available?\n\n\"We would not be able to predict the weather.  Credit cards would\nbe worthless pieces of plastic.  We would save less lives without\nenough information and the means to analyze it.  We need  massive\namounts  of information to make informed decisions in  government\npolicies and actions.\n\n\"What if banks could no longer transfer money because the comput-\ners were empty? How could the airlines fly if there were no  pas-\nsenger records?  What good is an insurance company if its clients\nnames are nowhere on file?  If there was no phone book, who could\nyou  call?   If hospitals had no files on your  medical  history,\nwhat treatment is required?  With a little effort, one can  imag-\nine how difficult it would be to run this planet without informa-\ntion.\n\n\"Information, in short, is both a  global and a national  strate-\ngic asset that is currently under attack.\n\n\"Information and the information processing industry has come  to\nrepresent  a  highly  significant piece  of  our  gross  national\nproduct;  indeed,  the  way we live as  Americans,  enjoying  the\nhighest standard of living in the world, is due in large part  to\nthe extraordinary ability of having information at our fingertips\nin  a second's notice.  Anything we want in the form of  informa-\ntion  can literally be brought into our homes; cable  television,\ndirect satellite connections from the back yard.  The Library  of\nCongress, and a thousand and one other sources of information are\nat our fingertips from our living room chair.\n\n\"Without  information,  without  the machinery  that  allows  the\ninformation to remain available, a veritable national  electronic\nlibrary, the United States steps back thirty years.\n\n\"Information is as much a strategic weapon in today's world as is\nthe gun or other conventional armaments.  Corporate successes are\noften  based  upon well organized data banks and  analytic  tech-\nniques.   Government  functions, and assuredly the Cold  War  was\nfought,  on the premise that one side has more accurate  informa-\ntion than its adversary.  Certainly academia requires the  avail-\nability  of information across all disciplines.  Too, the  public\nin  general relies upon widespread dissemination  of  information\nfor even the simplest day to day activities.\n\n\"It  is  almost inconceivable that society could function  as  we\nknow it without the data processing systems upon which we rely.\n\n\"It  is  with these thoughts that those more expert  than  I  can\nspeak at length, but we must realize and accept the responsibili-\nty for protecting that information.  Unfortunately, we as  trust-\ning  Americans, have allowed a complacency to overshadow  prudent\npragmatism.\n\n\"Over  the  last weeks we have begun to see the  results  of  our\ncomplacency.  The veins of the nation, the free flow of  informa-\ntion, is being poisoned.\n\n\"Both the government and the private sector are to blame for  our\nstate  of disarray and lack of preparedness in dealing  with  the\ncurrent crisis.  We must be willing, individually and collective-\nly,  to  admit that we are all at fault,  then we  must  fix  the\nproblem, make the sacrifice and then put it behind us.\n\n\"It is impossible for the Government to deny that we have  failed\nmiserably in our information security and privacy implementation.\nLikewise,  the  value of the accumulation of information  by  the\nprivate  sector was overlooked by everybody.  Fifteen years  ago,\nwho  could have possibly imagined that the number  of  businesses\nrelying on computers would have jumped more than a hundred  thou-\nsand fold.\n\n\"Today,   the  backbone  of  America,  the   small   businessman,\n20,000,000 strong, the one man shop, provides more jobs than  the\nFortune  1000.   And, the small businessman has come to  rely  on\nhis computer as Big Business has for decades.  His survival,  his\nsuccess  is  as critical to the stability of the  United  States'\neconomy  as  is a General Motors or an IBM.  We must  defend  the\nsmall  business  as surely as we must  defend  our  international\ncompetitiveness of industrial leaders.\n\n\"The  wealth  of this country was once in steel  mills,  in  auto\nplants,  in  manufacturing.   The products built  by  the  United\nStates  were  second  to none.  Made in the U.S.A.  was  a  proud\nlabel,  one that carried a premium worldwide.  Our  technological\nleadership  has never been in question and has been the  envy  of\nthe world for over 200 years.  Franklin, Fulton and Edison.   The\nWright  Brothers, Westinghouse, Ford.  As a nation the  Manhattan\nProject reaffirmed our leadership.  Then Yaeger and the speed  of\nsound.  The transistor.  DNA decoded.  The microchip.  The  Moon.\nThe computer.\n\n\"Yet there was a subtle shift occurring that escaped all but  the\nmost vigilant.  We were making less things, our concentration  on\nmanufacturing  was slowly shifting to an emphasis on  technology.\nCommunications,  computers.  Information processing.   No  longer\nare cities built around smokestacks spewing forth the  byproducts\nof  the manufacturing process.  Instead, industrial parks  sprout\nin   garden-like  settings  that  encourage  mental   creativity.\nFifteen percent of the American workforce no longer drive to  the\noffice. They commute via their computers at home.\n\n\"The  excitement of the breakneck pace of technology  masked  the\ndanger in which we were placing ourselves.  Without realizing it,\na  bulk of this nation's tangible wealth was being moved  to  the\ncontents  of  a computer's memory.   We took  those  first  steps\ntoward computerization hesitantly; we didn't trust the  computer.\nIt  was  unfamiliar, foreign, alien.  But when  we  embraced  the\ncomputer, we unquestioningly entrusted it with out most  precious\nsecrets.\n\n\"Unlike the factory though, with the fence, the gates, the  dogs,\nthe alarms and the night guards, we left our computers unprotect-\ned.    Growing bigger and faster computers took  precedence  over\nprotecting their contents.\n\n\"We  were  warned, many times.  But, as I said  earlier,  neither\nyour  government  nor its constituency heeded the  warnings  with\nenough diligence.  Protection of government information became  a\nback-burner issue, a political hot cake, that in budget crunches,\nwas  easy to overlook.  Overclassification of information  became\nthe  case of the 'The Spy Who Cried Wolf.'    The  classification\nsystem has been abused and clearly does not serve us well.  At my\ndirection it will receive a thorough overhaul.\n\n\"Personal  privacy has been ignored.  Your government is in  pos-\nsession  of  huge amounts of data and yet there is no  effort  at\nprotecting  the  non-classified  privacy of  individuals  in  our\ncomputers.\n\n\"The private sector faces another dilemma.  The  unresponsiveness\nof the Federal Government to  the protection of its own  informa-\ntion  did not set a good example for industry, and their  comput-\ners, too, remained vulnerable.\n\nThe  President paused from reading his speech to pour a glass  of\nice water.\n\n\"Nothing  can stop the fact that the United States is  under  at-\ntack.   Nothing  can change the fact that the  attack  cannot  be\nturned  away.  And nothing can change the fact that America  will\nsuffer  significant disruptions and inconvenience for some  time.\nBut we can minimize the damage.  We can prepare for the  inevita-\nble obstacles we will face.\n\n\"The  poison that Mr. Homosoto put into the American  information\nsociety is the equivalent of electronic biological warfare.    He\nhas  senselessly  and vengefully struck out  against  the  United\nStates in a manner that I describe as an act of war.\n\n\"In  order to deal with this real threat to the security  of  the\nUnited  States  of America, I have taken several steps  that  are\ndesigned to assist in weathering the storm.\n\n\"First,  I  am assigning the Director of  the  National  Security\nAgency  to coordinate all efforts at defending against and  mini-\nmizing the effects of the current crisis.  The NSA has the  expe-\nrience and resources, and the support of this President to manage\nan  operation  of this complexity and importance.   In  addition,\nrepresentatives  from GCHQ in the United Kingdom and other  ITSEC\nmembers from Germany, France and Holland will coordinate European\ndefensive strategies.\n\n\"Second, I am activating the following four groups to assist  the\nNSA in their efforts.  ECCO, the Emergency Computer Crisis Organ-\nization,  has  acted as an advisor to  law  enforcement  agencies\nacross  the  country and has been instrumental in  providing  the\ntechnical  support  to the FBI and the Secret  Service  in  their\ncomputer crime investigations.\n\n\"CERT,  the Computer Emergency Response Team was created  by  the\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency as an outgrowth of  the\n1988  INTERNET Worm incident.  Carnegie Mellon  University  where\nCERT  is  headquartered has donated the facilities and  staff  of\ntheir Software Engineering Institute to deal with the invasion of\nour computers.\n\n\"The Defense Data Network Security Coordination Center was  based\nat the Stanford Research Institute by the Defense  Communications\nAgency  to  coordinate attacks  against  non-classified  computer\nsystems.\n\n\"Lastly, CIAC, the Computer Incident Advisory Capability  manages\ncomputer  crises for the Department of Energy at Lawrence  Liver-\nmore Laboratories.\n\n\"These  are  the organizations and the people who will  guide  us\nthrough  the coming adversities.  It is they who are  responsible\nto  insure that America never again finds itself  so  vulnerable.\nSo  open  to attack.  So helpless in our  technological  Achilles\nHeel.\n\n\"The  organizations I mentioned, and the government  itself  have\nnot  yet been tested in a crisis of significant magnitude.   This\nis  their maiden voyage, so to speak, and it is incumbent on  us,\nthe  American  people,  to make their job as easy as  we  can  by\noffering our complete cooperation.\n\n\"And, tonight, that is what I am asking of you.  Your assistance.\nYour  government  cannot do it alone.  Nor  can  small  localized\nindividual  efforts  expect to be successful against an  army  of\ninvaders  so large.  We must team together, act as one,  for  the\ngood  of the entire country.  From the big business with  100,000\ncomputers to the millions of men, women and children with a  home\ncomputer;  from the small businessman to the schools, we need  to\ncome  together  against the common enemy:  the  invasion  of  our\nprivacy and way of life.\n\n\"Americans come together in a crisis, and my fellow Americans, we\nface  a crisis.  Let me tell you what my advisors tell me.   They\ntell me without taking immediate drastic steps to prevent further\ndestruction  of America's information infrastructure, we  face  a\ndepression as great as the one of the 1930's.\n\n\"They tell me that every computer in the country, most in Canada,\na  significant number in England and other countries, can  expect\nto be attacked in some manner within two years.  That  represents\nover 70 million casualties!\n\n\"The  international financial and monetary system will come to  a\nhalt  and collapse.  Financial trading as we know it  will  cease\nand wild speculative fluctuations will dominate the world curren-\ncy markets.  America is already feeling the change since the  ATM\nnetworks were removed from service.\n\n\"As we have seen, the transportation facilities of this  country,\nand  indeed  the world, are totally dependent  on  computers  and\ntherefore vulnerable.  That is why today we take so seriously the\nthreats  against the airlines.  There is no choice  but  success.\nTogether,  the American people must stand up to this  threat  and\nnot succumb to its effects.\n\n\"While your government has the resources to develop solutions  to\nthe  problems, it has not been within our power to mandate  their\nuse in the private sector.\n\n\"We  will need unity as never before, for the battleground is  in\nour  homes,  our schools, our streets and  our  businesses.   The\nchildren  of this great country will have as much opportunity  to\ncontribute as their parents will, and as the leaders of  business\nwill.  As we all will and all must.\n\n\"In  conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, the very structure of  our\ncountry  is in imminent danger of collapse, and it is up  to  us,\nindeed  it  is within our power, to survive.  The  sacrifices  we\nwill be called upon to make may be great, but the alternative  is\nunacceptable.\n\n\"Indeed, this is a time where the American spirit is called  upon\nto  shine,  and  shine brightly.  Thank you, and  God  Bless  the\nUnited States of America.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Sunday, January 24\n     Scarsdale, New York\n\n\"One  fuckuva speech,\" Tyrone Duncan said to Scott Mason who  was\ndowning  the  last  of a Coors Light.  \"You should  be  proud  of\nyourself.\"    They had watched the President's speech on  Scott's\nlarge screen TV.\n\n\"Ahhhh,\" grunted Scott.  \"It's almost anti-climatic.\"\n\n\"How  the hell can you say that?\"  Tyrone objected.  \"Isn't  this\nwhat you've been trying to do?  Get people to focus on the  prob-\nlem?  Christ, you can't do much more than a Presidential speech.\"\n\n\"Oh,  yeah,\" agreed Scott cynically.  \"Everyone knows, but not  a\ndamn thing's gonna be done about it.  Nothing.  I don't care what\nthe President says, nothing's going to change.\"\n\n\"You  have become one cynical bastard.  Even Congress  is  behind\nthe  President on this one.  His post-speech popularity  is  over\n70% according to CNN's Rapid Sample Poll.\"\n\n\"CNN.   Bah,  Humbug.  Sensationalist news.  And  you  think  the\nproposed computer crime bills will pass?\" Scott asked doubtfully.\n\nTyrone hesitated.  \"Sure, I think so.  And you don't?\"\n\n\"No, I don't.  At least not in any meaningful way.  C'mon, you're\nthe constitutionalist not me.  Sure, the original authors of  the\nbill will write something with punch, maybe even effective.   But\nby the time it gets committee'd to death, it'll be another  piece\nof  meaningless  watered  down piece of  shit  legislation.   And\nthat's  before the states decide that computer crime is  a  state\nproblem  and not an inter-state issue.  They'll say Uncle Sam  is\ntreading  on  their turf and put up one  helluva  stink.\"   Scott\nshook his head discouragingly.  \"I see nothing but headaches.\"\n\n\"I  think  you just feel left out, like your job's done  and  you\nhave  nothing  to do anymore. Post partum depression.\"   Ty  rose\nfrom  the comfortable leather reading chair to get a couple  more\nbeers.  \"I kind of know how you feel.\"\n\nScott looked up at Tyrone in bewilderment.  \"You do?  How?\"\n\n\"I'm definitely leaving.  We've made up my mind.\"  Tyrone  craned\nhis neck from the kitchen.  \"Arlene and I, that is.\"  Tyrone came\nback  and threw a silver bullet at Scott.  \"This part of my  life\nis over and it's time I move on to something else.\"\n\n\"Computers and the Law I suppose?\"  Scott said drearily.\n\n\"Don't  make  it sound like the plague,\"  Tyrone  laughed.   \"I'm\ndoing  it  because I want to, and it's needed. In  fact  I  would\nexpect  a  good amount of the work to be pioneering.   Pro  bono.\nThere's  no  case  history; it'll be precedent  setting  law.   I\nfigure  someone's  got  to be there to keep it  honest.  And  who\nbetter than  . . .\" Tyrone spread his arms around the back of the\nchair.\n\n\"You,  I know.  The great byte hope.\"  Scott  laughed at his  own\njoke which triggered a similar response from Tyrone.  \"Hey,  man.\nI wish you all the best, if that's what you really want.\"\n\nA sudden beeping began.  \"What's that?\" asked Tyrone.\n\n\"A  computer  begging  for attention.  Let me  see  who  it  is.\"\nTyrone  followed  Scott into his office,  still  astonished  that\nanyone  could work in such a pig pen.  And the rest of the  house\nwas so neat.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION>>>>>>\n\nThe  computer  screen  held the image of the  single  word  while\nwhoever was calling caused Scott's computer to beep incessantly.\n\n\"What the hell?\" Scott said out loud as he pecked at the keyboard\nstanding rather than sitting at his desk.\n\nwtfo\n\nYOU'RE THERE.  GOOD.\n\nkirk?\n\nYUP.  WANNA GO TO A DEBATE?\n\nExcuse me?\n\nYOU WATCH THE PRESIDENT?\n\nOf course.  I have a mild interest in the subject.\n\nSO  DID I AND EVERY OTHER PHREAK IN THE COUNTRY, AND THEY'RE  NOT\nHAPPY.\n\nWhy?\n\nSEE  FOR YOURSELF.  THE CONVERSATION PIT AT NEMO IS BRIMMING.   I\nGOT YOU AN INVITE.\n\nI have a guest.\n\nFRIEND OR FOE\n\nfriend. definitely.\n\nREMEMBER HOW TO USE MIRAGE?\n\nI can fake it.\n\nTo Tyrone's amazement, Scott seemed to know what he was doing  at\nthe  computer.  Scott sat down, put his  electronic  conversation\nwith Kirk on hold, and called up another program as the  colorful\nscreen split into two.\n\nI got you on the bottom window.\n\nYOU'LL SEE THE PIT ON THE TOP.  JOIN IN WHEN YOU WANT.\n\nMaybe I'll just listen.\n\nWHATEVER.  I'M LOGGING ON.\n\nThe top window on Scott's computer screen blinked off momentarily\nand then was filled with a the words from the dissident phreaks.\n\nCONVERSATION PIT: KIRK, RAMBO, PHASER, FON MAN, POLTERGEIST,\n\nAND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?   <<FON MAN>>\n\nB  THE FASCIST GOVERNMENT IS JUST TRYING TO TAKE OVER.  THE  BILL\nOF RIGHTS IS GOING RIGHT DOWN THE SHITTER  <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nI  AGREE.  THEY LOOK FOR ANY EXCUSE TO TAKE AWAY ANY  FREEDOM  WE\nMAY HAVE LEFT AND THEY TOOK THIS HOMOSOTO THING AND BLEW IT RIGHT\nOUT OF PROPORTION.  JUST LIKE VIETNAM.  <<PHASER>>\n\nYOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DO YOU? <<RAMBO>>\n\nYOU BET YOUR SWEET ASS I DO.  SINCE WHEN HAS THE GOVERNMENT GIVEN\nA SHIT ABOUT US?  ONLY SINCE THEY REALIZED WE HAVE POWER  WITHOUT\nTHEM.  THEY'RE NO LONGER IN CONTROL AND THEY'LL DO ANYTHING  THEY\nHAVE TO TO GET IT BACK.  <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nI DON'T THINK THAT IT'LL BE THAT BAD  <<KIRK>>\n\nYOU BEEN HANGING OUT WITH THAT MASON GUY TOO MUCH <<PHASER>>\n\nCAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY.  HE'S LISTENING  <<KIRK>>\n\nALL THE BETTER.  HE'S AS BAD AS THE FEDS. <<PHASER>>\n\nMay I say something?\n\nWHY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG?\n\nI must beg to differ with Phaser with a question.\n\nIT'S YOUR DIME.  <<PHASER>>\n\nBelieve me, I understand that you guys have a point, about  hack-\ning and the free flow of information.  But who's in control  now?\nFrom my viewpoint, it's not you and it's not the government. It's\nHomosoto.\n\nSO? <<PHASER>>\n\nSo, if freedom is the issue as you say, I assume that you want to\nkeep your electronic freedom at all costs.\n\nRIGHT! <<PHASER>>\n\nTHAT'S THE POINT <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nTherefore, regardless of your opinions, you must realize that the\ngovernment will do everything it thinks it needs to do to protect\nthe country.\n\nMAKE YOUR POINT. <<PHASER>>\n\nIt  seems to me that the best way for you to keep the  electronic\nfreedom  you crave, might be to help fight Homosoto and  the  vi-\nruses  and  all.   Minimize the damage, help  defend  the  Global\nNetwork.\n\nHE MAKES A POINT.  I'VE HELPED. <<KIRK>>\n\nTHEN  WE FALL INTO THEIR TRAP.  SAVE IT ALL AND THEN  THEY  CLOSE\nDOWN THE NETWORK.  I CAN'T PLAY INTO THEIR DECEIT AND  TREACHERY.\n<<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nDO YOU THINK THE FREEDOM LEAGUE IS DOING GOOD? <<KIRK>>\n\nOF COURSE NOT. <<PHASER>>\n\nThat's Homosoto.  Thousands of viruses.  NEMO already helped.\n\nONLY THOSE THAT AGREE.  WE ARE NOT A DEMOCRACY.  <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nSO YOU DON'T WANT TO FIGHT THE VIRUSES? <<RAMBO>>\n\nNOT YOU, TOO? <<PHASER>>\n\nIT'S A MATTER OF RIGHT AND WRONG.  ELECTRONIC FREEDOM, ANARCHY IS\nONE THING.  BUT WE DO NOT ABUSE.  WE LIVE BY THE CODE AND WANT TO\nKEEP THE NETWORK OPEN.  HOMOSOTO WANTS TO CLOSE THE NETWORK DOWN.\nBY SCARE TACTICS.  <<RAMBO>>\n\nTHAT  DOESN'T  CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE FASCIST  GOVERNMENT  WILL\nTAKE EVERYTHING AWAY. <<PHASER>>\n\nOnly  if  they have to.  Wouldn't you rather help and  keep  that\nfrom happening?\n\nIF I TRUSTED THE GOVERNMENT. <<PHASER>>\n\nCan I introduce you to someone?  His handle is FBI.\n\nKIRK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING, GIVING US AWAY? <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nTHEY'RE TIED IN ON MIRAGE.  THEY CAN PLAY BUT THERE'S NO  REDIAL.\n<<KIRK>>\n\nGentlemen, this is the FBI.  Let me tell you something.  I  don't\nagree with hacking, theft of service and the like.  But I also am\npragmatic.  I recognize the difference between the lesser of  two\nevils.   And as of today, based upon what I know, you guys are  a\npain the ass, but not a threat to national security.  That is why\nWashington has taken little interest in your activities.  But  at\nthe same time, you are part of an underground that has access  to\nthe electronic jungle in which we find ourselves.  We would  like\nyour help.\n\nOFFICIALLY? <<PHASER>>\n\nNo, unofficially.  I am law enforcement, associated with ECCO, if\nyou've ever heard of them.\n\nECCO.   YOU GUYS FIGHT THE REAL COMPUTER JERKS, DON'T YOU?   LIKE\nROBERT MORRIS AND PUNJAB.  DID YOU EVER CATCH THE GUY WHO STOPPED\nTHE SHUTTLE FLIGHT?  <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nSadly,  no.  I am talking to you as a friend of Scott's.   And  I\nwill tell you, that anything I learn I will use to fight  Homoso-\nto's attack.  But frankly, you are little fish.  I don't know who\nyou  are,  nor do I really care.  In all  honesty,  neither  does\nWashington, the NSA or anyone else.  You're merely an underground\nprotest  group.  If anything, you help keep us honest.  But  even\nprotestors should have their limits.\n\nMINE HAS BEEN REACHED.  <<KIRK>>\n\nAND MINE.  <<RAMBO>>\n\nThere is a big difference between freedom of speech and insurrec-\ntion and invasion.\n\nWHAT ABOUT PRIVACY?  <<PHASER>>\n\nTHERE IS NONE, AND YOU KNOW IT. <<KIRK>>\n\nTHAT'S  THE POINT.  WE HAVE TO STOP THE MILITARISTIC WAR  MONGERS\nFROM  PRYING INTO OUR LIVES.  THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT US,  AND\nMORE.  I WANT TO SEE THAT STOPPED.  NOW.  <<PHASER>>\n\nThis  is  Mason.   At the expense of  true  freedom?  Freedom  of\nchoice?   By your logic, you may end up with no  Compuserve.   No\nelectronic mail boxes. No networks.  Or, they'll be so restricted\nthat you'll never get on them.\n\nIT'LL HAPPEN ANYWAY. <<PHASER>>\n\nAnd  you'll just speed up the process.  What do you have to  lose\nby helping out?\n\nI WANT TO CONTINUE HELPING.  MY FREEDOM TO HACK RESPONSIBLY IS IN\nDANGER BY ONE MAN, AND I AIM ON KEEPING MY FREEDOM. <<KIRK>>\n\nIt  may  be the only way to keep the digital highways  open,  I'm\nsorry to say.\n\nIS THAT A THREAT?  <<PHASER>>\n\nMerely an observation.\n\nI NEED TO THINK. <<PHASER>>\n\nWHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW? <<RAMBO>>\n\nA lot.  We need a complete list of phone numbers for every  Free-\ndom BBS.  They provide wide distribution of infected software.\n\nWE KNOW. BFD. <<PHASER>>\n\nThis is FBI.  We want to shut them down.\n\nHOW? <<KIRK>>\n\nWe have our means.\n\nSEE WHAT I MEAN!  THEY'RE ALL PIGS.  THEY TAKE, TAKE, TAKE.   BUT\nIF YOU ASK SOMETHING THEY CLAM UP. <<PHASER>>\n\nAll  right.   If it works you'll find out anyway.   There  are  a\nnumber  of underused laws, and we want to keep this on a  Federal\nlevel.  USC 1029, 1030, 2134 - they're a bunch of them  including\nracketeering.   Then there are  a number of Federal laws  against\ndoing anything injurious to the United States.\n\nWHICH  GIVES  YOU  THE RIGHT TO PROSECUTE ANYONE  YOU  DAMN  WELL\nPLEASE WHENEVER YOU DAMN WELL WANT. <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nAs a lawyer, I could make that case.\n\nI AM A LAWYER, TOO.  I PHREAK FOR PHREEDOM. <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nThen you also know, that you have to really be on someone's  shit\nlist to get the FBI after you.  Right now, Homosoto and his  gang\nare on our shit list big time.\n\nTHEN  WHEN  YOU'RE THROUGH WITH THEM, IT'S US NEXT.   THEN  WHO'S\nLEFT? <<PHASER>>\n\nRIGHT. <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nWe  can argue forever.  All I'm saying is we could  use  whatever\nhelp  you  can give us.  And I honestly don't care who  you  are.\nUnless of course you're on my shit list.\n\nFBI HUMOR.  <<KIRK>>\n\nWHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED?  <<RAMBO>>\n\nAs  many signatures as possible.  We figure that there are  thou-\nsands of you out there, and you can probably do a better job than\nany  government  security group punching in at nine  and  out  at\nfive.   You have more people, no bureaucracy and a bigger  sample\nof the software population.\n\nSIGNATURES?  NO QUESTIONS ASKED?  <<PHASER>>\n\nNone.  Also, rumors.\n\nWHAT KIND OF RUMORS?  <<KIRK>>\n\nLike who might want to disrupt the Air Reservations System.\n\nYOU'RE KIDDING?  <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nI wish I was.  You see, we are up against the wall.\n\nTHAT COULD REALLY FUCK THINGS UP.  <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nREALLY! <<KIRK>>\n\nIS IT REALLY THAT BAD?    <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nWorse.\n\nMAYBE I'LL THINK ABOUT IT. <<POLTERGEIST>>\n\nME TOO. <<PHASER>>\n\nMASON.  I'M GOING TO CUT YOU OFF. <<KIRK>>\n\nIt won't be the first time.\n\n     <<<<<<CONNECTION TERMINATED>>>>>>\n\nTyrone  stretched  his limbs searching for a bare  place  to  sit\ndown.  Leaning over Scott's shoulders for the slow paced computer\nconversation  stiffened  his muscles.  Scott  motioned  to  slide\nwhatever  was  in the way, out of the way, to which  Tyrone  com-\nplied.\n\n\"Dedicated  mother fuckers.  Misguided, but dedicated.\"   Ty  sat\nback in thought.  \"What do you think they'll do?\"\n\n\"I  don't think, I know,\" said Scott confidently.  \"Most of  them\nwill  help, but they won't admit it.  They openly  distrust  you,\nWashington  and me.  But they value their freedom,  and  instinc-\ntively they will protect that.  Kirk will be the conduit. I'm not\nworried.\"\n\n\"And what will they do?\"\n\n\"Once  they get around to it, they'll commandeer every hacker  in\nthe  country and at least stop the viruses.  Or some of them.   I\nthink  that we need to elicit their trust, and I can do  that  by\ngiving them more than they give me.\"\n\n\"Can you do that?\"\n\n\"Just  watch.   If  they  play their cards  right,  they  can  be\nheroes.\"\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                              Chapter 29\n     Monday, January 25\n     The White House\n\nWe  had a pretty good handle on parts of it,\" said Marvin  Jacobs\nglibly.\n\nPhil  Musgrave, Martin Royce, Henry Kennedy and Quinton  Chambers\njoined Marvin in one of the private White House conference  rooms\nat  5  A.M.  Jacobs had called all members of the  inner  circle,\npersonally, early that morning.   He had received word that  last\nevening's  computer  conversations between Scott  Mason  and  the\nSpook  had  been  intercepted and the  preliminary  analysis  was\nready.\n\nScott Mason's computer screens had been read by the NSA's  remote\nelectromagnetic  receivers while he prepared his article for  the\nfollowing  day.  The actual article had also been transmitted  to\nthe White House, prior to publication, as agreed.\n\n\"And  Mason  seems to be living up to his part of  the  bargain,\"\nJacobs  continued.   \"He only edits out the bullshit,  pardon  my\nFrench.  Gives the public their money's worth.\"\n\n\"You  said  we were close.  How close?\"  Musgrave tended  to  run\nthese meetings; it was one of the perks of being the  President's\nNumber One.\n\n\"His organization was a lot more comprehensive than we  thought,\"\nHenry Kennedy said.  \"We underestimated his capabilities, but  we\ncaught the essence of his weapons by good guessing.\"\n\n\"If  we  could  get our hands on this  Spook  character,\"  sighed\nMartin Royce.  He was thinking of the perennial problems  associ-\nated  with identifying the exact location of someone who  doesn't\nwant to be found.\n\n\"That's not the problem,\" said Chief of Staff Phil Musgrave.  \"We\nknow who the Spook is, but we can't prove it.  It's only hearsay,\neven  with Mason's testimony, and it's a pretty damn safe bet  he\nwon't  be  inclined to testify.  But Marv has given us a  ton  on\nhim.  After all, he is Marv's fault.\"\n\n\"You  guys  sort that out on your own time,\" yawned  Phil.   \"For\nnow, though we need to know what we're up against.\"\n\n\"If the President hadn't gone on television last night, we  might\nhave been able to keep this quiet and give the press some answers\nin a few days.\"  Marv said.\n\n\"Dream  on,\" Phil said emphatically.  \"Mason broke the story  and\nwe were caught with our pants down.  The President did not, and I\nrepeat, did not, want to be associated with any cover up . . .\"\n\n\"I didn't say cover up . . .\"\n\n\"He  wants to take his lumps and fix it.  He will not lie to  the\nAmerican people.\"\n\n\"If we shut Mason up.\"  Marv suggested.\n\n\"We  need him right where he is,\" Henry Kennedy said about  Scott\nto stem the escalating argument.\n\n\"The  subject  is  closed.\"  Phil's comment  silenced  the  room.\nAfter all was said and done, Musgrave was the closet thing to the\nPresident in the room.  As with the President, the discussion was\nover, the policy set, now let's get on with it.  \"So, Marv?  What\nare we up against.\"\n\nThe seasoned professional in Marvin Jacobs took over, conflicting\nopinions  in the past, and he handed out a series of  TOP  SECRET\nbriefing folders.\n\n\"You've  got to be kidding,\" laughed Martin Royce holding up  his\nfile.   \"This  stuff  will be in today's morning  paper  and  you\nclassify it?\"\n\n\"There are guidelines for classification,\" Marvin insisted.   \"We\nfollow them to the letter.\"\n\n\"And  every  letter gets classified.\" muttered  Royce  under  his\nbreath.  The pragmatist in him saw the lunacy of the  classifica-\ntion process, but the civil servant in him recognized the  impos-\nsibility of changing it.  Marv ignored the comment and opened his\nfolder.\n\n\"Thanks,  Phil,\" began Marv.  \"Well, I'll give it to him,  Foster\nthat  is.  If what he says is accurate, we have our work cut  out\nfor  us, and in many cases all we can do is board up our  windows\nbefore the hurricane hits.\"\n\n\"For  purposes of this discussion, assume, as we will,  that  the\nSpook,  Foster, is telling the truth.  Do we have any  reason  to\ndisbelieve him?\"\n\n\"Other  than attacking his own country?  No, no reason  at  all.\"\nMarvin  showed total disdain for Foster.  His  vehemence  quieted\nthe room, so he picked up where he left off.\n\n\"The  first thing he did was establish a communications  network,\ncourtesy  of AT&T.  If Foster is right, then his boys  have  more\ndoors and windows in and out of the phone company computers  than\nAT&T  knows  exist.  For all intents and purposes,  they  can  do\nanything with the phone system that they want.\n\n\"They  assign their own numbers, tap into digital  transmissions,\nreprogram  the  main switches, create  drop-dead  billings,  keep\nunlimited  access lines and Operator Control. If we do  locate  a\nconversation,  they're  using  a  very  sophisticated  encryption\nscheme to disguise their communications.  They're using the  same\nbag  of  tricks we tried to classify over 20 years  ago,  and  if\nanyone had listened . . .\"\n\n\"We  get the point, Marv,\" Phil said just before Henry was  about\nto say the same thing.\n\n\"We  can triangulate the cell phone location, but it takes  time.\nPerhaps the smartest thing Foster did was recognize the need  for\nan efficient distribution system.  In order for his plan to work,\nhe  had  to  insure  that  every  computer  in  the  country  was\ninfected.\"\n\n\"Thus  the dGraph situation?\"  Quinton Chambers finally began  to\nlook awake.\n\n\"And  the Lotus Viruses, and the Freedom software,\"  Henry  said.\n\"What about FTS-2000?\"  He was asking about the new multi-billion\ndollar  voice  and data communications network.  FTS  stands  for\nFederal Telecommunications System.\n\n\"I  have  no doubt that it's in the same boat,\"  suggested  Marv.\n\"But  we have no sure data yet.  We should ask Scott to ask  Fos-\nter.\"\n\n\"What could happen?\"\n\n\"Worst case?  The government shuts down for lack of interest  and\nno dial tone.\"\n\n\"And these viruses?\"\n\n\"According  to  Foster, they designed over 8,000 viruses  and  he\nassumes that all or most of them have been released over the last\nseveral years,\" Marv said to a room full of raised eyebrows.\n\n\"How bad is that?\"  asked Chambers.\n\n\"Let's  put it this way,\" said Marv.  \"In the last 14  years,  of\nthe  viruses  that  have been confirmed,  the  longest  gestation\nperiod,  from release to detonation . . .was eight  months.   And\nthat  one  was discovered a couple of weeks after they  were  re-\nleased.   What  Foster counted on was the fact that  if  software\nbehaved  normally,  it  wouldn't be suspect.  And  if  it  became\npopular, it was automatically above suspicion.  He was right.\"\n\n\"I've heard that every computer is infected?\"\n\n\"At  the minimum, yes.\"  Jacobs turned the pages of his  dossier.\n\"To  continue, one of Foster's most important tools was the  con-\nstruction of road maps.\"\n\n\"Road maps?\" questioned Phil.\n\n\"Connections,  how  it  all ties together.  How  MILNET  ties  to\nINTERNET  to DARPANET to DockMaster, then to  the  Universities.\"\nMarv wove a complex picture of how millions of computers are  all\ninterconnected.  \"Foster knew what he was doing.  He called  this\ngroup  Mappers. The maps included the private  nets,  CompuServe,\nThe Source, Gemini, Prodigy . . .BBS's to Tymenet . . .the  lists\ngo  on  forever.  The road maps, according to Foster,  were  very\ndetailed.  The kind of computer, the operating system, what  kind\nof  security  if any.  They apparently raked through  the  hacker\nbulletin  boards  and  complied massive lists  of  passwords  for\ncomputers . . .\"\n\n\"Including ours?\"  asked Quinton Chambers.\n\n\"Quite  definitely.  They kept files on the back doors, the  trap\ndoors  and the system holes so they could enter  computers  unde-\ntected,  or  infect the files or erase them . . .take a  look  at\nSocial Security and the IRS.  Martin?\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Royce nodded in strong agreement.  \"We got hit\nbut  good.  We still have no idea how many hundreds of  thousands\nof tax records are gone forever, if they were ever there.  So far\nit's  been kept under wraps, but I don't know how long  that  can\ncontinue.  The CDN has been nothing but trouble.  We're  actually\nworse off with it than without it.\"\n\n\"How  can one person do all of that?\" Chambers had little  knowl-\nedge of computers, but he was getting a pretty good feel for  the\npotential political fallout.\n\n\"One  person!  Ha!\"  exclaimed Jacobs.  \"Look at  Page  16.\"   He\npointed  at  his  copy of the Secret  documents.   \"According  to\nFoster  he told Homosoto he needed hundreds of full time  mappers\nto draw an accurate and worthwhile picture of the  communications\nand networks in the U.S..\"\n\n\"That's a lot of money right there,\" added Royce.\n\n\"It's  obvious that money wasn't a consideration.\"  Phil  spouted\nthe  current political party line as well as it  was  understood.\n\"Retaliation against the United States was the motivation, and to\nhell with the cost.\"\n\n\"Homosoto  obviously took Foster's advice when it came to  Propa-\nganda,\" Marv continued.  \"The FBI, I believe, saw the results  of\na  concentrated effort at creating distrust in computers.   We've\ngot  a  team  working on just finding  the  blackmailers.   Their\nversion of a disinformation campaign was to spread the truth, the\nsecret  undeniable  truths of those who most want to  keep  their\nsecrets a secret.\"\n\n\"That's  also  where the banks got hit so  hard,\"  offered  Henry\nKennedy.  \"Tens of thousands of credit card numbers were spirited\naway  from bank computers everywhere. You can imagine  the  shock\nwhen  tens of millions of dollars of purchases were contested  by\nthe legitimate credit card holders.\"\n\n\"It's bad,\" agreed Royce.\n\n\"And  we haven't even seen the beginning yet, if we believe  Fos-\nter. There were other groups.  Some specialized in  Tempest-Bust-\ning . . .\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\" asked Quinton Chambers.\n\n\"Reading the signals broadcast by computers,\" Marv said with some\nderision.  The Secretary of State should know better, he thought.\n\"It's  a classified Defense program.\"  He paused  while  Chambers\nmade  a note.  \"Others used stolen EMP-T bomb technology to  blow\nup  the  Stock  Exchange  and they even  had  antennas  to  focus\nHERF . . .\"\n\n\"HERF?\" laughed Phil.\n\n\"HERF,\"  said  Marv defensively.  \"High Energy  Radiated  Fields.\nPick  a frequency, add an antenna, point and shoot.   Poof!  Your\ncomputer's history.\"\n\n\"You're kidding me . . .\"\n\n\"No joke.  We and the Soviets did it for years; Cold War  Games,\"\nsaid  Kennedy.   \"Pretty  hush-hush stuff.   We  have  hand  held\nelectric guns that will stop a car cold at a thousand yards.\"\n\n\"Phasers?\" asked Chambers.\n\n\"Sort of, Quinton,\" chimed in Phil.\n\n\"Foster's plan also called for moles to be placed within  strate-\ngic  organizations,  civilian and government.\"   Marv  continued.\n\"They  were to design and release malicious software from  inside\nthe  company.  Powerful technique if you can find  enough  bodies\nfor the dirty work.\"\n\n\"Again, according to Foster, Homosoto said that there was never a\nmanpower problem,\" Marv said.  \"He's confident that an Arab group\nis  involved somewhere.  The MacDonald's accident was  caused  by\nArabs who . . .\"\n\n\"And  we still can't get shit out of the one who  we're  holding.\nThe   only   one  that's  left.   Troubleaux  was  shot   by   an\nArab  . . .the FBI is working hard on that angle.  They've  given\nthemselves extraordinary covers.\" Phil was always on top of those\nthings  that  might have a political cause and/or  effect.   \"How\nextensive an operation was this?\"\n\nMarvin Jacobs ruffled through some notes in his files. \"It's hard\nto  be sure.  If Homosoto followed all of Foster's plan, I  would\nguess  3 - 5,000 people, with a cost of between $100 - $300  Mil-\nlion.  But mind you, that's an uneducated guesstimate.\"\n\nQuinton Chambers dropped his pen on the table.  \"Are you  telling\nus  that one man is bringing the United States virtually  to  its\nknees for a couple of hundred million?\"  Marv reluctantly nodded.\n\"Gentlemen,  this is incredible, more than incredible .  .  .does\nthe President know?\"\n\nEven  Phil Musgrave was antsy with the answer to  that  question.\n\"Not  in any detail, but he is very concerned.  As for the  cost,\nterrorism has never been considered expensive.\"\n\n\"Well  thank  you Ron Ziegler, for that  piece  of  information,\"\nscowled Chambers.  \"So if we know all of this, why don't we  pick\n'em all up and get this over with and everything working again?\"\n\n\"Foster claims he doesn't know who anyone other than Homosoto is.\nHe was kept in the dark.  That is certainly not inconsistent with\nthe  way Homosoto is known to do business -  very  compartmental-\nized.  He didn't do the recruitment, he said, and all  communica-\ntions were done over the computer . . .no faces, no names. If  it\nwasn't for Mason, we wouldn't even know that Foster is the Spook.\nI consider us very lucky on that point alone.\"\n\n\"What  are  we going to do? What can we do?\" Royce  and  Chambers\nboth  sounded  and looked more concerned than the  others.  Their\nagencies  were  on  the front line and the most  visible  to  the\npublic.\n\n\"For the government we can take some mandatory precautions.   For\nthe private sector, probably nothing . . .\"\n\n\"Unless.\"  Phil said quietly.\n\n\"Unless what?\"  All heads turned to Phil Musgrave.\n\n\"Unless the President invokes martial law to protect the  country\nand  takes control of the computers until we can respond.\"   Phil\noften thought out loud, even with his extremist possibilities.\n\n\"Good idea!\" said Jacobs quickly.\n\n\"You think that public will buy that?\" asked Chambers.\n\n\"No, but they may have no choice.\"\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Tuesday, January 26\n\n     PRESIDENT DECLARES WAR ON COMPUTERS\n     By Scott Mason\n\nSupport  for the President's Sunday night call to arms  has  been\nvirtually unanimous by industry leaders.\n\nAccording to James Worthington, Director of Computing Services at\nFirst  National Life, \"We take the threat to our  computers  very\nseriously.   Without the reliable operation of our  MIS  systems,\nour  customers  cannot be serviced and the  company  will  suffer\ntremendous losses.  Rates will undoubtedly rise unless we protect\nourselves.\"\n\nSimilar  sentiments  were echoed by most industry  leaders.   IBM\nannounced  it  would be closing all of its computer  centers  for\nbetween two and four weeks to effect a complete cleansing of  all\nsystems  and  products.   A spokesperson for IBM  said,  \"If  our\ncomputers  are  threatened, we will take all necessary  steps  to\nprotect our investment and the confidence of our customers.   IBM\nprefers a short term disruption in normal services to a long term\nfailure.\"\n\nWell  placed persons within the government concur that  the  NSA,\nwho  is responsible for guiding the country through  the  current\ncomputer  crisis, is ideally suited for managing  the  situation.\nEven  agencies who have in the past been critical of  the  super-\nsecret NSA are praising their preliminary efforts and recommenda-\ntions to deal with the emergency.\n\nIn  a several page document issued by the NSA, a series of  safe-\nguards  is  outlined  to protect computers against  many  of  the\nthreats they now face.   In addition, the NSA has asked all  long\ndistance carriers to, effective immediately, deny service to  any\ndigital communications until further notice.  Despite high  marks\nfor  the NSA in other areas, many of their defensive  recommenda-\ntions have not been so well received.\n\n\"We  are actually receiving more help from the public  BBS's  and\nlocal  hacker groups in finding and eradicating the viruses  than\nfrom the NSA or ECCO,\" said the Arnold Fullerman, Vice  President\nof Computer Services at Prudential.\n\nAT&T  is also critical of the government's efforts.  \"The  Presi-\ndential  Order gives the NSA virtual control over the use of  our\nlong distance services.  Without the ability to transmit  digital\ndata  packets,  we can expect a severely negative impact  on  our\nfirst  quarter earnings . . .\"  While neither AT&T nor the  other\nlong  distance carriers indicated they would defy  the  executive\ndecree, they did say that their attorneys were investigating  the\nlegality of the mandate.\n\nThe NSA, though, was quick to respond to criticism. \"All the  NSA\nand its policies are trying to achieve is a massive reduction  in\nthe  rate of propagation of the Homosoto Viruses, eliminate  fur-\nther infection, so we can isolate and immunize as many  computers\nas  possible.  This will be a short term situation  only.\"    De-\ntractors vocally dispute that argument.\n\nAT&T, Northern TelCom and most telephone manufacturers are taking\nadditional  steps  in protecting one of Homosoto's  key  targets:\nPublic  and Private Branch Exchanges, PBX's, or  phone  switches.\nThey  have all developed additional security recommendations  for\ncustomers  to  keep  Phone Phreaks from  utilizing  the  circuits\nwithout authorization.  Telephone fraud alone reached an estimat-\ned $14 Billion last year, with the courts upholding that  custom-\ners  whose  phones were misused are still liable for  all  bills.\nLarge companies have  responded by not paying the bills and  with\nlawsuits.\n\nThe  NSA is further recommending federal legislation to  mitigate\nthe  effects of future computer attacks.  They propose that  com-\nputer security be required by law.\n\n\"We  feel that it would be prudent to ask the private  sector  to\ncomply  with  minimum security levels. The C2 level  is  easy  to\nreach, and will deter all but the most dedicated assaults.  It is\nour  belief that as all cars are manufactured with  safety  items\nsuch  as  seat belts, all computer should  be  manufactured  with\nsecurity and information integrity mechanisms in place. C2  level\nwill meet 99% of the public's needs.\"  A spokesman for ECCO,  one\nof  the  emergency computer organizations working  with  the  NSA\nexplained  that  such security levels available  outside  of  the\nhighest  government levels range from D Level, the weakest, to  A\nLevel, the strongest.\n\nIt  is estimated that compliance with such  recommendations  will\nadd no more than $50 to the cost of each computer.\n\nThe  types  of organizations that the NSA  recommend  secure  its\ncomputers  by  law is extensive, and is meeting with  some  vocal\nopposition:\n\nCompanies  with more than 6 computers connected in a  network  or\nthat use remote communications.\n\nCompanies which store information about other people or organiza-\ntions.\n\nAll Credit Card merchants.\n\nCompanies that do business with local, state or federal agencies.\n\nThe entire Federal Government, regardless of data classification.\n\nAll  publicly funded organizations including  schools,  universi-\nties, museums, libraries, research, trade bureaus etc.\n\nPublic Access Data Bases and Bulletin Boards.\n\n\"It  is crazy to believe that 45 million computers  could  comply\nwith  a  law like that in under 2 years,\" said Harry  Everett,  a\nWashington  D.C.  based security consultant.  \"In  1987  Congress\npassed a law saying that the government had to protect 'sensitive\nbut unclassified data' to a minimum C2 level by 1992.  Look where\nwe  are now!  Not even close, and now they expect to  secure  100\ntimes that many in one tenth the time?  No way.\"\n\nAnother critic said, \"C2?  What a joke.  Europe is going by ITSEC\nand  they  laugh  at the Orange Book.  If you're  going  to  make\nsecurity a law, at least do it right.\"\n\nNSA  also had words for those computers which do not  fall  under\nthe  umbrella of the proposed legislation.

The  proposed 'nominal fees'  are  intended  to\ninsure  that the technology to protect computer systems keeps  up\nwith other computer technology.\n\nCritics,  though,  are extremely vocal in their opposition  to  a\nbill that they say sends a strong message to the American people:\nWe  don't trust you.  The FYI, Freeflow of Your Information  says\nthat  passage of the Computer License Law will give  the  federal\ngovernment  the  unrestricted  ability and right  to  invade  our\nprivacy.  Dr. Sean Kirschner, the chief ACLU counsel, is  consid-\nering  a  lawsuit against the United States if the  bill  passes.\nKirschner  maintains  that \"  . . .if the License Law  goes  into\neffect,  the streets will be full of Computers Cops  handing  out\ntickets if your computer doesn't have a license.  The enforcement\nclauses  of  the bill essentially give the police  the  right  to\nlisten  to your computer.  That is a simple invasion of  privacy,\nand  we will not permit a precedent to be set.  We lost too  much\nfreedom under Reagan.\"\n\nProponents of the bill insist that the low fee, perhaps only  $10\nper year per computer, is intended to finance efforts at  keeping\nsecurity  technology  apace with computer technology.   \"We  have\nlearned  our lesson the hard way, and we now need to address  the\nproblem head on before it bites us again.\"  They cite the example\nof England, where televisions have been licensed for years,  with\nthe fees dedicated to supporting the arts and maintaining  broad-\ncasting facilities.\n\n\"Does not apply,\" says Dr. Kirschner.  \"With a television,  there\nisn't  an  issue of privacy.

It  is\nout of business.\n\nFallsworth,  Idaho, population 433, has a computer population  of\n611.\n\nBut  no  one in the entire incorporation of Fallsworth  has  ever\nbought or paid for a single piece of software or hardware.\n\nThree  years ago, the town counsel approved a plan to  make  this\nsmall potato farming community the most computerized township  in\nthe United States, and it seems that they succeeded.   Apparently\nthe  city hall of Fallsworth was contacted by representatives  of\nApple Computer.  Would they like to be part of an experiment?\n\nApple Computer provided every home and business in the Fallsworth\narea  with a computer and the necessary equipment to tie  all  of\nthe computers together into one town-wide  network.  The city was\na  pilot  program  for the Electronic City of  the  future.   The\nresidents  of  Fallsworth were trained to use the  computers  and\nApple and associated companies provided the township beta  copies\nof software to try out, play with and comment on.\n\nFallsworth, Idaho was truly the networked city.\n\nLily  Williams and members of the other 172 households in  Falls-\nworth  typed out their grocery lists on their computer,  matching\nthem  to  known inventories and pricing  from  Malcolm  Druckers'\nGeneral Store.  When the orders arrived at the Drucker  computer,\nthe goods just had to be loaded in the pick up truck.   Druckers'\nbusiness increased 124% after the network was installed.\n\nDoctors  Stephenson, Viola and Freemont, the three  town  doctors\nmodem'ed prescriptions to Baker Pharmacy so the pills were  ready\nby the time their patients arrived.\n\nMack's  Messengers  had cellular modems  and  portable  computers\ninstalled in their delivery trucks.  They were so efficient, they\nexpanded their business into nearby Darbywell, Idaho, population,\n5,010.\n\nToday,  Fallsworth,  Idaho doesn't use its computers.   They  lie\ndormant.  A town without life.   They forgot how to live and work\nand  play  and  function without their  computers.  Who  are  the\nslaves?\n\nThe  viruses of Lotus, of dGraph. The viruses of Freedom  struck,\nand no one in the entire town had registration cards.  The  soft-\nware  crisis has left Fallsworth and a hundred other  small  test\nsites for big software firms out in the digital void.\n\nApple  Computer  promised to look into the matter but  said  that\ncustomers who have paid for their products come first . . .\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Friday,  March 5\n     FBI Building, Federal Square\n\nTyrone  Duncan  was as busy as he had ever  been,  attempting  to\ncoordinate the FBI's efforts in tracking down any of the increas-\ning number of computer criminals. And there were a lot of them at\nthe moment.  The first Copy-Cat computer assaults were coming  to\nlight,  making  it all that much more difficult  to  isolate  the\nFoster  Plan  activities from those other  non-coordinated  inci-\ndents.\n\nTyrone,  as did his counterparts in regional FBI offices  nation-\nwide, created teams of agents who concentrated on specific  areas\nof  Homosoto's assault as described by the Spook.  Some  special-\nized  in tracing missing electronic funds, some in  working  with\nthe phone company through the NSA.  More than any other goal, the\nFBI wanted desperately to locate as many of the invisible  agents\nthat  the Spook, Miles Foster, had told Homosoto to use.   Tyrone\ndoubted  they would catch anywhere near the 3000 or more  he  was\ntold  that  were  out there, but at this point  any  success  was\nwelcome.\n\nFBI  agents  toiled and interviewed and  researched  sixteen  and\neighteen hours a day, seven days a week.  There hadn't been  such\na  blanket approval of overtime since the Kennedy  assassination.\nThe  FBI followed up the leads generated by the computers at  the\nNSA.   Who and where were the likely associates of  Homosoto  and\nFoster?\n\nHis  phone rang - the private line that bypasses  his  secretary-\nstartling Tyrone from the deep thought in which he was  immersed.\nOn  a Saturday.  As the voice on the other end of the  phone  ut-\ntered  its  first  sound, Tyrone knew that it  was  Bob  Burnson.\nApparently he was in his office today as well.\n\n\"Afternoon, Bob,\" Tyrone said vacantly.\n\n\"Gotcha at a bad time?\"  Burnson asked.\n\n\"No, no.  Just going over something that may prove interesting.\"\n\n\"Go ahead, make my day,\" joked Burnson.\n\n\"I know you don't want to know . . .\"\n\n\"Then don't tell me . . .\"\n\n\"But Mason's hackers are coming through for us.\"\n\n\"Jeez, Ty,\" whined Bob.  \"Do you have to . . .\"\n\n\"Do  you  know anybody else that is capable of moving  freely  in\nthose  circles?   It's not exactly  our  specialty,\"  reprimanded\nTyrone.\n\n\"In theory it's great,\" Bob reluctantly agreed, \"but there are so\ndamn  many exposures.  They can mislead us, they're  not  profes-\nsionals,  and worst of all, we don't even know who they  are,  to\nperform a background check.\"\n\n\"Bob,  you  go over to the other side . . . playing desk  man  on\nme?\"\n\n\"Ty, I told you a while ago, I could only hang so far out  before\nthe branches started shaking.\"\n\n\"Then  you  don't know anything.\"  Tyrone  said  in  negotiation.\nKeep  Bob officially uninformed and unofficially  informed.  \"You\ndon't  know that NEMO has helped to identify four of  the  black-\nmailers and a handful of the Freedom Freaks.  You don't know that\nwe  have gotten more reliable information from Mason's kids  than\nfrom ECCO, CERT, NIST and NSA combined.  They're up in the clouds\nwith  theory  and conjecture and  what-iffing  themselves  silly.\nNEMO is in the streets.  A remote control informer if you like.\"\n\n\"What else don't I know?\"\n\n\"You  don't know that NEMO has been giving us security  holes  in\nsome  of  our  systems.  You don't know that  Mason's  and  other\nhackers have been working on the Freedom viruses.\"\n\n\"Some systems?  Why not all?\"\n\n\"They still want to keep a few trapdoors for themselves.\"\n\n\"See what I mean!\" exclaimed Burnson.  \"They can't be trusted.\"\n\n\"They  are  not on our payroll.  Besides, it's them or  no  one,\"\nTyrone calmly said.  \"They really would like to keep the real-bad\nguys off of the playing field, as they put it.\"\n\n\"And keep the spoils for their own use.\"\n\n\"It's a trade-off I thought was worthwhile.\"\n\n\"I  don't  happen  to  agree, and  neither  does  the  Director's\noffice.\"\n\n\"I thought you didn't know . . .\"\n\n\"Word  gets around.  We have to cap this one, Ty.  It's too  hot.\nThis is so far from policy I think we could be shot.\"\n\n\"You know nothing.  Nothing.\"\n\nBut Burnson and the FBI and the White House all knew they  wanted\nFoster.   Tyrone  instinctively  knew as did  Scott,  that  Miles\nFoster was the Spook.  Other than meager unsubstantiated  circum-\nstantial  evidence, though, there was still no  convincing  legal\nconnection  between  Miles Foster and the Spook.  Not  enough  of\none, anyway.\n\nMiles Foster had done an extraordinary job of insulating  himself\nand his identity from his army.\n\nThere had to be another way.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Monday, March 8\n     New York City Times\n\n     Lawsuit Cites Virus\n     by Scott Mason\n\nWill stockholders of corporations soon require that all Corporate\nassets be appropriately protected?  Including those contained  in\nthe  computers?  Many people see a strong possibility of a  swell\nof  Wall Street investor demands to secure the computers of  pub-\nlicly  held companies.  The SEC is planning on issuing a  set  of\npreliminary regulations for firms under its aegis.\n\nLast week, a group of 10,000 Alytech, Inc. stockholders filed the\nfirst  class  action suit along this vein.  They  are  suing  the\ncurrent  board  of directors for \" . .  .willful  dereliction  of\nfiduciary responsibility in the adequate security and  protection\nof corporate information, data, communications and data  process-\ning  and  communications equipment.\"  The suit continues  to  say\nthat  the company, under the Directors' leadership  and  guidance\nknew and understood the threat to their computers, yet did  noth-\ning to correct the situation.\n\nAttorneys  for the plaintiffs have said that they are in  posses-\nsion  of a number of internal Alytech documents and  memos  which\nspelled out security recommendations to their board of  directors\nupon which no action was taken.\n\nAlytech  was one of the many companies hit particularly  hard  by\nthe  Computer War.  The dGraph virus, the Lotus viruses  and  the\nNovell viruses were among those that infected over 34,000 of  the\ncompany's computers around the world;  bringing the company to  a\nvirtual halt for over two weeks.  Immediately after getting their\ncomputers back up and running, they were struck by several  Free-\ndom viruses which were designed to destroy the hard disks on  the\ncomputers.\n\nAs of this date, Alytech still has over 10,000 computers  sitting\nidly  waiting  for the much delayed shipments of hard  disks  re-\nquired to repair the machines.\n\nA spokesman for Alytech, Inc. says that the lawsuit is  frivolous\nand without merit.\n\nA  date of June 14 has been set for the courts to hear the  first\nof many rounds of motions.\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Sunday, March 21\n     Paris, France\n\nSpring in Paris is more glorious than any reviewer can adequately\nportray.\n\nThe  clear air bristles with fresh anticipation like lovers on  a\ncool  afternoon.  Bicycles, free from a winter of hiding  in  ga-\nrages, fill the streets and parks.  All of Paris enjoys the first\nstroll of the year.\n\nCoats  and jackets are prematurely shed in favor of t-shirts  and\nskimpy tank-tops and the cafes teem with alfresco activity.   The\nlucky  low-season  American  tourist  experiences  firsthand  the\nFrench foreplay to summer.\n\nLooking  down  to the streets from the 'deuziemme \u001b\u0002\ntage'  of  the\nEiffel Tower, only a hundred feet up, the sheer number of stroll-\ners,  of  pedestrian cruisers, of tourists and of the  idly  lazy\noccupies the whole of one's vista.\n\nMartin Templer leaned heavily on the wrought iron railing of  the\nrestaurant  level,  soaking  up the tranquility  of  the  perfect\nSunday  afternoon. He gazed across the budding  tree-lined  Seine\ntoward the Champs Elys\u001b\u0002\ne and the Arc de Triumph; from Notre  Dame\nto the skyscrapered Ile de la Cit\u001b\u0002\n.  He mentally noted the incon-\ngruity  between  the aura of peace that Paris radiated  with  its\noften  violent history.  He hoped nothing today would break  that\nspell.\n\nA  sudden  slap on the back aroused Templer from his  sun  warmed\ndaydream.  He turned his head in seeming boredom.  \"You'd make  a\nlousy pickpocket.\"\n\n\"That's  why I avoided a life of crime.\"  Alexander Spiradon  was\nimmaculately  dressed, down to the properly folded silk  handker-\nchief  in his suit jacket.  \"How are you today my friend?  Did  I\ninterrupt your reverie?\"\n\nTempler  swung  his  London Fog over his  shoulder.   His  casual\nslacks and stylish light weight sweater contrasted severely  with\nAlex's  comfortable air of formality.  \"I don't get  here  often.\nParis  is a very special place,\" Templer mused, turning from  his\nview of the city to face his old comrade.\n\n\"It  is  indeed,\" agreed Alex.  \"Then why do you look  so  melan-\ncholy?  Does Paris bring you memories of sadness?\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" Templer said, eyes down.\n\n\"You  didn't give me much notice,\" Alex said good naturedly.   \"I\nleft  the most beautiful woman in the world in a jacuzzi  at  St.\nMoritz.\"\n\n\"No,  I'm  sorry. I know I didn't, but it was  urgent.   Couldn't\nwait.\"  A slight breeze caused Templer to shiver.  He slowly  put\non  his  tan rain coat and looked right into Alex's  eyes.   \"I'm\ngoing to ask you straight.\"\n\nAlex confidently grinned.  \"Ask what?\"\n\n\"Was  Taki Homosoto a client of yours?\"  The biting words  seemed\nto have little impact on Alex.\n\n\"My clients trust me to keep their identities confidential.\"  The\nexpression on Alex's face didn't change.\n\n\"The  guy's dead.  What the hell can it hurt?\"  Templer  laughed.\n\"What's he gonna do?  Sue you for breach of contract?\"\n\nAlex didn't say a word.  He saw Templer laugh the confident laugh\nof a chess player one move from checkmate and he realized how un-\ncomfortable a position this was for him.  How do you behave  when\nyou're on the losing end of the stick?  Alex was thinking like he\ncared  what  Templer  knew or thought.  In  reality,  though,  he\ndidn't  care any more about what anyone thought of him.   He  had\nenough money, more than enough money, to lead a lavish  lifestyle\nwithout worry.  So what did it matter.  As friends nothing  would\nchange  between him and Martin.  But professionally, that  was  a\ndifferent matter.\n\n\"I'd love to tell you, but, it's a matter of ethics,\"  Alex  said\nhappily.  \"You understand.\"\n\n\"It  really doesn't matter,\" laughed Templer.  \"Let's walk.   The\nwind's picking up.\"   They unconsciously joined in the  spontane-\nous promenade of walkers who shuffle around the mid level of  the\nTower to share in the ambience that only Paris offers.\n\n\"You know, I'm officially retired,\" Alex said breathing in  deep-\nly.\n\n\"I'm not surprised.  Must have been a very profitable endeavor.\"\n\n\"I  saved a little and made prudent investments,\"  Alex lied  and\nTempler knew it.  No need to push the point.\n\n\"How well did Sir George do?  He wouldn't tell us.\"\n\nAlex  stopped  in his tracks and glared at Martin  with  a  blank\nemotionless  expression  for several seconds until his  deep  set\nbrown eyes began to twinkle.   A knowing smile and nod of  recog-\nnition  of accomplishment followed, telling Martin he had  hit  a\nhome  run.   \"You're good. Very good.\"  They both  began  walking\nagain,  as if on cue.  \"For future edification, how did you  find\nhim?\"\n\n\"Them.  Sir George was the most helpful, though.\"\n\n\"I  remember him.  Real character, kind of helpless but with  the\ngift  of gab.\"  Alex seemed unconcerned that any of  his  network\nhad been discovered.  \"He talked?\"\n\n\"Second rate criminal.  Definitely deportable.\"\n\n\"And you made him an offer he couldn't refuse.\"\n\n\"Something  like that,\" Templer said coyly.  \"Let's just  say  he\nprefers the vineyards of California to the prisons in England.\"\n\nAlex nodded in understanding.  \"How'd you find him?\"\n\n\"Telephone records.\"\n\n\"That's impossible,\" Alex said, shrugging off Martin's answer.\n\n\"Never  underestimate the power of silicon,\" Martin said  crypti-\ncally.\n\n\"Computers?  No way,\" Alex said defiantly.  \"Every year there are\nalmost  40  billion calls made within the  United  States  alone.\nThere's no way to trace that many calls.\"\n\n\"Who  needs  to trace?\"  Templer enjoyed the  joust.   Thus  far.\n\"The  phone company is kind enough to keep records of every  call\nmade.   Both local and long distance.   They're all  rather  com-\nplete.   From what number, to what number, if it's forwarded,  to\nwhat number and at what time and for how long.  They also tell us\nif  the calls were voice, fax, or other types of  communications.\nIt  even  identifies telephone connections that  use  encryption.\nBelieve me, those are flagged right off.\"\n\n\"You  monitor  every  conversation?  I thought it  was  just  the\noverseas calls.  That's incredible.  Incredibly illegal.\"\n\n\"But necessary.  The threat of terrorism inside the United States\nhas  reached unacceptable levels, and we had the capability.   It\nwas just a matter of flipping the switch.\"\n\n\"Since  when can you do that?\"  Alex asked, stunned that  he  had\noverlooked, or underestimated a piece of the equation.\n\n\"Since  the phone company computers were connected to  the  Fort.\nAnd,  I guarantee you, it's not something they want  advertised,\"\nMartin said in a low voice.  \"Did you fuck up?\"  They had circled\nthe Tower twice and stopped back where they started,  overlooking\nthe Seine.\n\nAlex's  professional composure returned as they leaned  over  the\nTower's railing.\n\n\"I  guess  I  wasn't as right as I  usually  am,\"  he  snickered.\nTempler followed suit.   \"How many did you get?\"\n\n\"How many are there?\"\n\n\"That would be telling,\" Alex said coyly.\n\n\"I  assume, then, that you would be averse to helping us  out  of\nour  current dilemma.\"  Being friends with potential  adversaries\nmade this part of the job all the more difficult.\n\n\"Well,\"  Alex  said turning his head toward Martin.  \"I  guess  I\ncould  be  talked into one more job, just one, if the  price  was\nright.\"\n\nTempler shook his head.  \"That's not the right answer.\"\n\nAlex  was  taken off guard by the sullenness in  Martin's  voice.\n\"Right  answer?  There are no right and wrongs in  our  business.\nOnly  shades of gray.  You know that.  We ride a fence,  and  the\nwinds blow back and forth.  It's not personal.\"\n\nMartin  straightened up and put both hands deep into the  pockets\nof  his  London  Fog.  \"Among the professionals,  yes.   But  Sir\nGeorge  and  his cronies, and you by default,  broke  the  rules.\nCivilians are off limits.  We were hoping that you would want  to\nhelp.\"\n\nAlex ignored the second request.  \"I won't do it again.  I  prom-\nise,\" he said haughtily.\n\n\"Is  there  anything  I can say that will  make  you  reconsider?\nAnything at all?\"  Martin implored.\n\n\"No,\"  Alex said.  \"Unless we can discuss an  equitable  arrange-\nment.\"\n\nMartin took his hands out of his pockets and said, \"I don't think\nthat will work.  I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Sorry?\"\n\nMartin quickly moved his right hand up to Alex's neck and touched\nit  briefly.   Alex  reached up and slapped his  neck  as  terror\novertook  his face.  He grabbed Martin's arm and twisted it  with\nhis  free  hand to expose a small needle tipped  dart  projecting\nfrom  a  ring on one finger.  Templer wrested his arm  free  from\nAlex's  weakening clutch and tore off the ring, tossing  it  away\nfrom the Tower.\n\nAlex  weakened further as he leaned both hands on the railing  to\nsteady  himself.   His mouth gaped wide, intense fear  and  utter\ndisbelief  competing for control of his facial  muscles.   Martin\nignored  his collapsing adversary and walked deliberately to  the\nopen elevator which provided escape down to street level.  Before\nthe  doors  had  closed, Templer saw a crowd  converge  over  the\ncrumpled body of Alexander Spiradon.\n\nMartin Templer crossed the Seine and performed evasive  maneuvers\nto  make sure he was not being followed.  The  cleansing  process\ntook  about three hours.  He  flagged down a taxi  and  the  most\nuncooperative  driver refused to acknowledge he  understood  that\nthe  destination was the American Embassy on Gabriel.  Only  when\nTempler  flashed  a 100 Franc note did the driver's  English  im-\nprove.\n\nTempler showed his CIA credentials to the Marine Sergeant at  the\nsecurity desk, and told him he needed access to a secure communi-\ncations channel to Washington.\n\nAfter  his identity was verified, Templer was permitted  to  send\nhis message.  It was electronically addressed to his superiors at\nCIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\n\n          PLATO COULDN'T COME OUT AND PLAY.\n          UNFORTUNATE STROKE INTERRUPTED THE INTERVIEW.\n\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                    Chapter 30\n\n     Monday, March  22\n     National Security Agency\n\nHe  had two separate offices, each with a unique character.   One\nultra modern and sleek, the other befitting a country  gentleman.\nThe  two  were connected by a large anteroom that  also  provided\nimmediate  access and departure by a private elevator and  escape\nstairs.  He could hold two meetings at once as  was  occasionally\nrequired  in his position as DIRNSA, Director, National  Security\nAgency.  Each office had its own secretary and private  entrance,\nselected for use depending upon whom was expected.\n\nThe meeting in the nouveau office was winding down to a close and\nthe  conversation  had been reduced to friendly  banter.   Marvin\nJacobs  had  brought  in three of his senior  advisors  who  were\ncoordinating  the massive analytical computing power of  the  NSA\nwith  the extraordinary volume of raw data that all of  the  5ESS\nswitches downloaded daily.\n\nSince they had been assigned to assist the FBI, the NSA had  been\nhunting down the locations of the potential conspirators with the\nassistance  of  the  seven Baby Bells and  Bell  Laboratories  in\nPrinceton,  New Jersey.  The gargantuan task was delicately  bal-\nancing  a  fine line between chaos and  stagnancy;  legality  and\namorality.\n\nAs they spoke, Jacobs heard a tone emit from his computer and  he\nnoticed that Office-2 had a Priority Visitor.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\"  Marvin Jacobs said as he stood.  \"It seems that  my\npresence  is required for a small matter.  Would you mind  enter-\ntaining yourselves for a few minutes?\"  His solicitous nature and\npolitical clout demanded that his visitors agree without  hesita-\ntion.\n\nHe  walked over to a door by the floor to ceiling  bookshelf  and\nlet himself in, through the gracious ante-room by the commode and\ninto  his heavy wood and leather office.  He immediately saw  the\nreason for the urgency.\n\n\"Miles,  Miles  Foster,  my boy!  How are  you?\"   Marvin  Jacobs\nwalked straight to Miles, vigorously shook his hand and gave  him\na big friendly bear hug.\n\nMiles  smiled from ear to ear.  \"It's been cold out there.   Glad\nto be home.\"  He looked around the room and nodded  appreciative-\nly.  \"You've been decorating again.\"\n\n\"Twice.   You haven't been in this office for, what is  it,  five\nyears?\"   Jacobs held Miles by the shoulders.  \"My God it's  good\nto see you.  You don't look any the worse for wear.\"\n\n\"I had a great boss, treated me real nice,\" Miles said.\n\n\"Come  here,  sit  down,\" Marvin said ushering Miles  over  to  a\nthickly padded couch.  \"If you don't already know it, this  coun-\ntry owes you a debt of thanks.\"\n\n\"I  know,\"  Miles said, even though he had been paid  over  three\nmillion dollars by Homosoto.\n\n\"A  drink,  son?\"  At fifty-five, the red  faced  paunch  bellied\nJacobs  looked old enough to be Miles' father, even  though  they\nwere only fifteen years apart.\n\n\"Glenfiddich  on  the rocks.\"  Miles felt  comfortable.   Totally\ncomfortable and in control of the situation.\n\n\"Done.\"  DIRNSA Jacobs pressed a button which caused a hidden bar\nto  be  exposed from a mirror paneled wall.   The  James  Bondish\ntricks amused Miles.  \"Excuse me,\" he said to Miles.  \"Let me get\nrid of my other appointments.\"  Jacobs handed Miles the drink and\nleaned  over his desk speaking into telephone.   \"Uh, Miss  Gree-\nley, cancel my dates for the rest of the day, would you please?\"\n\n\"Of course, sir.\"  The thin female voice came across the  speaker\nphone clearly.\n\n\"And my regrets to the gentlemen in One.\"\n\n\"Yessir.\"  The intercom audibly clicked off.\n\n\"So,\" Marvin asked, \"how does it feel to be both the goat and the\nhero?\"\n\n\"Hey,  I  fixed it, just like we planned, didn't I?\"  Miles  said\narrogantly, but his deep dimples said he was joking. \"I  remember\neverything  you  taught me,\" he bragged.  \"Lesson  One:   If  you\nreally  want to fix something, first you gotta fuck it up so  bad\neveryone takes notice.  Well, how'd I do?\"  Miles still  grinned,\nhis  dimples radiating a star pattern across his cheeks.   Jacobs\napproved whole heartedly.\n\n\"You were a natural.  From day one.\"\n\n\"Homosoto  thought that fuck-it to fix-it was entirely too  weird\nat  first, so I quit calling it that.\"  Miles  fondly  remembered\nthose early conversations.  \"As you said, it takes a disaster  to\nmotivate Americans, and we gave them one.\"\n\n\"I'm  glad  you see it that way,\" Marvin said  obligingly.    \"It\noccurred to me that you might have gotten soft on me.\"\n\n\"Not  a  chance.\"  Miles countered.  \"How many men  get  to  lead\narmies,  first of all.  And I may be the first, ever, to lead  an\ninvasion  of my own country with my government's approval.   This\nwas  a sanctioned global video game.  I should thank you for  the\nopportunity.\"\n\n\"That's a hell of a way to look at it, my boy.  You show a lot of\ncourage.\"   Marvin  drank  to Miles' health.  \"It  takes  men  of\ncourage  to  run  a  country, and that's  what  we  do;  run  the\ncountry.\"    Miles  had heard many of Marvin's  considerable  and\nconservative  speeches before, but this one was new.  After  over\nfive years, that was to be expected.\n\n\"It  doesn't make a damn bit of difference who the President  is.\nThe Government stays the same regardless of who's elected every 4\nyears.\"  Marvin continued as Miles listened reverently.\n\n\"The  American  public thinks that politicians run  the  country;\nthey  think that they vote for the people who make the  policies,\nwho  set  the tone of the government, but they are so  wrong.  So\nwrong.\"  Marvin shook his head side to side.  \"And it's  probably\njust as well that they never find out for sure.\"  He held  Miles'\nattention.  Marv walked around the room drink in hand,  gesturing\nwith his hands and arms.\n\n\"The hundreds of thousands of Government employees, the ones that\nare  here  year after year after year, we are the ones  who  make\npolicy.  It's the mid-grade manager, the staff writer, the polit-\nical analysts who create the images, the pictures that the  White\nHouse and Capital Hill see.\n\n\"This  town, the United States is run by lifers; people who  have\ndedicated their lives to the American way of life.  The  military\ncontrols more than any American wants to know.  State Department,\nJustice,  HUD; each is its own monolithic bureaucracy  that  does\nnot  change direction overnight because of some election in  Bum-\nfuck,  Iowa.   It takes four years to find your way  through  the\ncorridors, and by then, odds are you'll be packing back to Maine,\nor  Georgia  or California or wherever you  came  from.\"   Marvin\nJacob's  vitriolic oration was grinding on Miles, but he  had  to\nlisten to his boss.\n\n\"So when this country gets into trouble, someone has to do  some-\nthing  about it.  God knows the politicians won't.  This  country\nwas  in real trouble and someone had to fix it. In this  case  it\nwas  me.  It's been a decade since the first warnings  about  how\nvulnerable our computers, our economy, shit, our National Securi-\nty  were.  The reports came out, and Congress decided  to  ignore\nthem.  Sure, they built up the greatest armaments in the  history\nof civilization, sold the future for a few trillion, but they ne-\nglected  to  protect their investment.\"   Jacobs  angrily  poured\nhimself another drink.\n\n\"I couldn't let that happen, so I decided that I needed to expose\nthe weaknesses in our systems before somebody else did.\"   Marvin\nspoke  proudly.  \"And what better way than to fuck it  up  beyond\nall  recognition.  FUBAR.  At least this way we were  in  charge,\nand  we  were able to pick the damage.  Thanks to  you.   Lessons\ntend to be painful, and I guess we're paying for some of our past\nsins.\"  He drank thirstily.\n\n\"Did those sins mean that I would have to be arrested by the FBI?\nI  couldn't  say a thing; not the truth.  They'd never  have  be-\nlieved  me.\"  Miles shuddered at the thought.  \"For a  moment,  I\nthought you might leave me to rot in jail.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" Marvin said happily. \"Didn't our people get you out,  just\nlike  I  promised? Less than an hour.\"  He sounded proud  of  his\nefforts.   \"Besides,  most of them were  bullshit  charges.   Not\nworth the effort to prosecute.\"\n\n\"I  never  underestimate the power of the  acronym,\"  Miles  said\nabout the NSA, CIA and assorted lettered agencies.  \"There was  a\nlot  of  not so quiet whispering when it was  released  that  the\ncharges  were dropped by the Federal Prosecutor.  Think that  was\nsmart, so soon?  Maybe we should have waited a couple of months.\"\n\nJacobs  looked up sharply at Miles' criticism of his actions  but\nspoke  with understanding.  \"We needed to get the cameras off  of\nyou  and  onto the real problem; it was the right  thing  to  do.\nYour  part is over.  You started the war.  Now it's up to  me  to\nstop  it.  It could not have gone any smoother.  Yes,\"    he  re-\nflected.   \"It's  time for us to take over.  You  have  performed\nmagnificently.  We couldn't ask for any more.\"\n\nMiles  sipped  at his drink accepting the  reasoning  and  asked,\n\"I've wondered about a few things, since the beginning.\"\n\n\"Now's  as good a time as any,\" Marv said edging  himself  behind\nhis desk.  \"I'd imagine you have a lot of holes to fill in.\"\n\n\"How did you get Homosoto to cooperate?  He seemed to fall  right\ninto place.\"\n\n\"It  was almost too easy,\" Jacobs commented casually.  \"We had  a\nnumber  of candidates.  You'd be surprised how many  people  with\nmoney  and power hold grudges against Uncle Sam,\"  he  snickered.\n\"It's hard to believe, but true.\"\n\n\"Meaning, if it wasn't him, it would have been someone else?\"\n\n\"Exactly.   There's no shortage of help in the revenge  business.\nThere are still many hibakusha, survivors of Hiroshima and  Naga-\nsaki, who still want revenge on us for ending the war and  saving\nso  may lives.  Ironic, isn't it?  That someone like Homosoto  is\ntwisted enough to help us, just to fuel his own hatred,\"   Marvin\nJacobs asked rhetorically.\n\n\"But he didn't know he was helping, did he?\" Miles asked.\n\n\"Of  course not.  Then he would have been running the  show,  and\nthis was my production.  No, it worked out just fine.\"\n\nJacobs paused for more liquor and continued.  \"Then we have a few\nEuropean industrialists, ex-Nazis who are available . . .the KGB,\nGRU,  Colombian  cartel  members. The list  of  assets  is  long.\nWhere's there's money, there's help, and most of them prefer  the\nYankee dollar to any other form of payment.   They forget that by\nhurting us they also hurt the world's largest economy, as well as\neverybody  else's  and  then the fiscal  dominoes  start  falling\nuncontrollably.\"\n\n\"You mean you bought him?\"  Miles asked.\n\n\"Oh, no!  You can't buy a billionaire, but you can influence  his\nactions,  if  he thinks that it's his idea.  It just  so  happens\nthat he was the first one to bite.  Health problems and all.\"\n\n\"What problems?\"\n\n\"In all likelihood it's from the radiation, the Bomb; his doctors\ngave  him  a  couple  of  years  to  live.   Inoperable  form  of\nleukemia.\"\n\n\"I didn't know . . .\"\n\n\"No one did. He insisted on complete secrecy.  He had not  picked\na successor to run OSO, and in some ways he denied the reality.\"\n\n\"Excuse  my tired old brain, but you're talking Spook-Speak.  How\ndid you know . . .?\"\n\n\"Old habits . . .\"  Marvin agreed.  \"As you well know, from  your\nemploy here, we have assets in every major company in the  world.\nEspecially those companies that buy and sell elected officials in\nWashington.   OSO and Homosoto are quite guilty of bribing  their\nway into billions of dollars of contracts.  Our assets, you  see,\ncan  work  in two directions.  They let us know what's  going  on\nfrom  the  inside and give us a leg up on the G2.  Then,  we  can\nplant  real or false information when needed.  The Cold  Economic\nWar.\"\n\n\"So you told Homosoto what to do?\"  Miles followed closely.\n\n\"Not  in  so many words.\"  Marvin wasn't telling all,  and  Miles\nknew  it.  \"We knew that through our assets we gave Homosoto  and\nseveral others the idea that U.S. computers were extremely  frag-\nile.   Back in 1983 the DoD and CIA prepared  classified  reports\nsaying that computer terrorism was going to be the  international\ncrime of choice in the last decade of the century.  Then the NRC,\nNSC and DIA issued follow-up reports that agreed with the  origi-\nnal  findings.  We saw to it that enough detail reached Tokyo  to\nshow just how weak we were.\"\n\nJacobs continued to tell Miles how the NSA effected the unwitting\nrecruitment of Homosoto.  \"That, a well timed resignation on your\npart,  and advertising your dissatisfaction with  the  government\nmade  you the ideal person to launch the attack.\"  Marvin  smiled\nwidely holding his drink in the air, toasting Miles.\n\nMiles  responded by raising his glass.  \"And then a suicide,  how\nperfect.\"    Jacobs  did not return the salute,  and  Miles  felt\nsudden iciness.  \"Right?  Homosoto's suicide.\"  Jacobs still said\nnothing.  \"Marv?  It was a suicide, wasn't it?\"\n\n\"Miss Perkins was of great help, too,\" Marvin said ignoring Miles\nquestions.\n\n\"Perky?  What's she got to do with this?\"  Miles demanded.\n\n\"Oh?  You really don't know?\"  Marvin was genuinely shocked.   \"I\nguess  she was better than we thought.  I thought you knew.\"   He\nlooked  down  to  avoid  Miles's  eyes.   \"Didn't  you  think  it\nodd . . .?\"\n\n\"That she introduced me to Homosoto?\"  Miles asked acrimoniously.\n\n\"She didn't.\"\n\n\"Of course she did,\" Miles contradicted.\n\n\"We  have a tape of the conversation,\" Marv disagreed.  \"All  she\ndid was ask you if you would work for a foreigner and under  what\ncircumstances.   Perkins'  job was to prep you  for  Homosoto  or\nwhoever  else we expected to contact you.  An admirable job,  huh\nMiles?\"   Marvin Jacobs seemed proud of her accomplishments,  and\ngiven  the  stunned gaping expression on Miles' face,  he  beamed\neven  more.   Miles didn't say a word, but his glazed  eyes  said\nloud and clear that he felt defiled.\n\n\"I'm  sorry Miles,\" Marvin said compassionately.  \"I  really  as-\nsumed  you  knew that she was a toy.  You certainly  treated  her\nthat way.\"  No reaction.  \"If it helps any, she was on Homosoto's\npayroll.  She was a double.\"\n\nMiles jerked his head back and then let out a long laugh.  \"Well,\nfuck me dead.  Goddamn, she was good!  Had me going. Not a  fuck-\ning clue.\"  Miles stood from his chair and laughed and smiled  at\nMarvin.  \"What a deal.  I get blow jobs courtesy of the  American\ntaxpayer and you get paid to watch.\"\n\n\"Miles, we know how you felt for her . . .\"\n\n\"Bullshit,\"  Miles said quickly.  \"That's fucking bullshit.\"   He\npounded on the desk.\n\n\"She's already on another assignment,\"  Marvin said calmly.\n\nMiles  couldn't  completely hide the dejection,  the  feeling  of\nloss,  no  matter how loudly he denied it.   \"Fuck  her!\"   Miles\nexclaimed.  He walked over to the high tech bar and made  himself\nanother strong drink. Perfect drink to get dumped by.  \"Another?\"\nhe asked Marvin who handed Miles his glass for a refill.\n\n\"As I was saying,\" Marvin said,  \"this country owes you a thanks,\nbeyond  any medals or awards, and unfortunately, there is no  way\nwe can publicly express our appreciation.\"  Marvin sat down  with\nhis drink and addressed Miles.\n\n\"Hey,\"  Miles  said holding his hands in front of him.   \"I  knew\nthat  going  into the deal.  I did my job, for  my  country,  and\nmaybe I lose some face, but I didn't do this for fame.   Retiring\nin style, maybe the Alps is a nice consolation prize.\"  The pain,\nso evident seconds ago about Stephanie, was gone.  Miles  gloated\nin his achievement.\n\nA  low  warble came from the phone on Marvin's desk.  He  read  a\nmessage that appeared on the small message screen attached to the\nphone  and  struck a few keys in response.  At that  moment,  the\ndouble  doors  from  the Office-2 reception opened  and  in  came\nTyrone Duncan and two other FBI agents.  Miles turned to see  who\nwas  interrupting  their meeting.  It was the same  man  who  had\narrested him a few weeks before.\n\nMiles   gulped deeply and felt his heart skip a beat.  'What  the\nhell is going on', he thought.  He quickly glanced at Jacobs. His\npulse  and respiration increased to the point of skin  sweat  and\nnear hyper-ventilation.\n\nTyrone  spoke to the Director.  \"Mr. Jacobs, we are here  to  see\nMr. Foster.\"   Jacobs gestured to Miles in the deep chair  across\nfrom the marble desk.\n\nMiles' mind raced.  What was Marv doing? And Duncan again?\n\n\"Mr.  Foster,\"  Tyrone Duncan said.  Miles looked up.   \"You  are\nunder arrest for violation of the espionage and sedition laws  of\nthe United States of America.  In addition, you are charged  with\nviolating  the Official Secrets Act and  . . .\"  Tyrone read  off\n94  federal crimes including racketeering and 61 assorted  counts\nof conspiracy.\n\nAs  Tyrone read the extended list of charges, Miles shook to  his\ncore,  turned  to Marvin in abject terror.  His face  cried  out,\n'please,  help me.'  Jacobs watched with indifference  as  Tyrone\ncontinued with the new charges.\n\n\"You  have the right to remain silent . . .\"  Tyrone  read  Miles\nhis Miranda rights as he lifted him from the chair to put on  the\ncuffs.\n\n\"Marv!\"  Miles shouted in panic.  \"This is a joke, and  it's  not\nfunny . . .Marv . . .Jesus Fucking Christ!\"  Miles struggled like\nan  animal.  He thought he was free. \"I'm the fucking fish  food.\nAren't I?  Marv,\" he shouted even louder.  \"Aren't I?\"\n\n\"It  seems  to me that you've dug your own grave, son.   I  can't\ntell  you how disappointed I am in your actions.\"  Jacobs  played\nthe role perfectly.\n\n\"You fucking liar!  The President doesn't even know about what  I\ndid for you? Does he?\"  Miles was screaming as Tyrone and another\nagent  restrained him by the arms.  \"Why not?  You told  me  that\nthis project had approval from the highest level.\"\n\n\"Are you mad?\"  Marvin sounded like a caring parent admonishing a\nmisbehaving  lad who knew no better. \"Do you think that he  would\nhave approved of such a plan?  Ruin his own country?  Is that why\nyou went to Homosoto?  Because we said you were crazy?\"\n\n\"You  told  me he approved it!\" Miles screamed at  Marvin.   \"You\nlied!  About that, about Stephanie, what else have you lied to me\nabout?\"\n\nJacobs sat silently as Tyrone turned the handcuffed Miles  toward\nthe door.\n\n\"Why don't you just admit it?  I'm the fucking fall guy for  your\nscheme, aren't I?\" Miles shouted. \"Admit it goddamnit, admit it!\"\n\nJacobs  looked down at his desk and shook his head from  side  to\nside as if he were terribly disappointed.\n\n\"I'll  get  you, I will get you for this,\"  Miles  shrieked.   \"I\ntrusted you, like a father and then you fuck me.  Fucked me  like\nevery other dumb shit that works here.\"  His vicousness  intensi-\nfied. \"Suck my dick!\" he shouted with finality.\n\nTyrone tugged at Miles to keep him from the Director's desk.  \"Is\nthere anything else Director Jacobs?\"\n\n\"Yes,  Agent Duncan, here.\"  Jacobs opened a drawer   and  pulled\nout  a large envelope, marked with Miles' name.  Miles stared  at\nit,  eyes  bulging  with fear.  Tyrone  looked  questioningly  at\nMarvin.\n\n\"I  believe  you will find enough in there to put Mr.  Foster  in\nTokyo  with Mr. Homosoto at the time he died.\"  Tyrone  took  the\npackage.   \"I think the Tokyo Police would be most interested  in\nmaking a possible case for murder.\"\n\nMiles screamed, \"scum bucket! You're fucking nuts.\"  His  vicious\nverbal assaults were aimed directly at  Marvin who ignored  them.\n\"You  know  I had nothing to do . . .goddamn you!  I  spend  five\nyears of my life helping my country and you  . . .\"\n\n\"I  think very few would agree that what you've done can be  con-\nsidered helpful.\"\n\n\"I will get even!  Even, do you hear!\"  Miles' voice was  getting\nhoarse from the outrageous tirade.\n\nDIRNSA  Marvin Jacobs raised his right hand to Tyrone  indicating\nthat  Miles was dismissed.  Miles continued bellowing  at  Marvin\nand  Tyrone  and the two other agents tried to keep him  in  tow.\nWhen  they  had  left, and the door closed  behind  them,  Jacobs\npushed a button on his phone and spoke casually.\n\n\"Miss Greeley?

Computers,  mainframes, mini computers, or  millions  of\npersonal  computers  - they do in fact control  and  monitor  our\nevery  activity, for better or for worse.  A marriage of  conven-\nience?\n\nNow, though, it appears to be for worse.\n\nI am reminded of the readings of Edgar Cayce and the stories that\nsurround  the myth of Atlantis.  According to Cayce  and  legend,\nAtlantis was an ancient ante-deluvian civilization that developed\na  fabulous  technology which achieved  air  flight,  levitation,\nadvanced medical techniques and harnessed the sun's energy.\n\nHowever, the power to control the technology which had exclusive-\nly  been controlled by the high priests of Atlantis was lost  and\naccess  to the technology was handed to the many peoples of  that\nancient culture.  Through a series of unintentional yet  reckless\nevents,  the Atlanteans lost control of the technology,  and  de-\nspite the efforts of the Priests,  their cities and cultures were\ndestroyed,  eventually causing Atlantis to sink to the bottom  of\nthe depths of the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nBelieving in the myth of Atlantis is not necessary to  understand\nthat the distribution of incredible computing power to 'everyman'\naugers a similar fate to our computerized society.  We  witnessed\nour  traffic  systems come a halt, bringing grid  lock  to  small\nrural  communities.  Our banks had to reconstruct  millions  upon\nmillions  of transactions in the best possible attempt at  recon-\nciliation.  The defensive readiness of our military was in  ques-\ntion  for some time before the Pentagon was satisfied  that  they\nhad cleansed their computers.\n\nThe  questions that arise are clearly ones to which there are  no\nsatisfying responses.  Should 'everyman' have unrestrained access\nto tools that can obviously be used for offensive and threatening\npurposes?   Is  there a level of responsibility  associated  with\ncomputer usage? If so, how is it gauged?  Should the  businessman\nbe  subject  to  additional regulations to  insure  security  and\nprivacy?   Are additional laws needed to protect the  privacy  of\nthe average citizen?  What guarantees do people have that  infor-\nmation about them is only used for its authorized purpose?\n\nShould 'everyman' have the ability to pry into anyone's  personal\nlife, stored on hundreds of computers?\n\nOne  prominent   group calling themselves FYI, Freeflow  of  Your\nInformation,  represented  by the ACLU, represents  one  distinct\nviewpoint  that  we  are likely to hear much  of  in  the  coming\nmonths.   They maintain that no matter what, if any,  restrictive\nmandates  are placed on computer users,  both are an invasion  of\nprivacy  and violation of free speech have occurred.  \"You  can't\nregulate  a pencil,\" has become their informal  motto  emblazoned\nacross t-shirts on campuses everywhere.\n\nWhile  neither  group has taken any overt legal  action,  FYI  is\nformidably equipped to launch a prolonged court battle.   Accord-\ning to spokesmen for FYI, \"the courts are going to have to decide\nwhether electronic free speech is covered by the First  Amendment\nof the Constitution.  If they find that it is not, there will  be\na  popular uprising that will shake the foundation of this  coun-\ntry.  A constitutional crisis of the first order.\"\n\nWith threats of that sort, it is no wonder that most advocates of\nprotective  and  security measures for computers are  careful  to\navoid a direct confrontation with the FYI.\n\n* * * * *\n\nFoster Treason Trials Begin\nJury Selection to Take 3 Months\n     Associated Press\n\nUnemployment Soars to 9.2%\nWorst Increase Since 1930\n     Wall Street Journal\n\nSONY's Threat\nSoon Own New York\n     New York Post\n\nHomosoto Hackers Prove Elusive\nFBI says, \"I doubt we'll catch many of them.\"\n     ISPN\n\nHard Disk Manufacturers Claim 1 Year Backlog\nExtraordinary Demand To Replace Dead Disks\n     San Jose Citizen Register\n\nSecurity Companies Reap Rewards\nFixing Problems Can Be Profitable\n     Entrepreneur\n\nAuto Sales Down 34%\n     Automotive Week\n\n92% Distrust Computers\n     Neilson Ratings Service\n\nCompaq Introduces 'Tamper Free' Computers\n     Info World\n\nIBM Announces 'Trusted' Computers\n     PC Week\n\nDow Jones Slides 1120 Points\n     Wall Street Journal\n\nSenator Nancy Investigates Gov't Security Apathy\n     Washington Times\n\nHollywood Freeway Halts\nComputer Causes 14 Hour Traffic Jam\n     Los Angeles Times\n\n* * * * *\n\n     A Day In The Life:\n     Without Computers\n     by Scott Mason.\n\nAs  bad as a reformed smoker, but without the well earned  battle\nscars,  I  have been, upon occasion, known  to  lightly  ridicule\nthose  who  profess the necessity of computers  to  enjoy  modern\nlife.  I have been known as well to spout statistics;  statistics\nthat show the average homemaker today spends more time homemaking\nthan  her ancestor 100 or 200 years ago.  I have  questioned  the\nlogic of laziness that causes us to pull out a calculator  rather\nthan figure 10% of any given number.\n\nI have been proven wrong.\n\nLast  Saturday  I really noticed the effects of the  Foster  Plan\nmore  than  any time since it began.  I must  confess  that  even\nthough  I  have written about hackers and computer crime,  it  is\naxiomatically  true  that  you don't notice it  till  it's  gone.\nAllow me to make my point.\n\nHave  you recently tried to send a fax?  The digital phone  lines\nhave  been  scrupulously pruned, and therefore busy most  of  the\ntime.\n\nThe check out lines at the supermarket have cob webs growing over\nthe bar code price scanner.   The system that I used when I was a\nkid,  as a delivery boy for Murray and Mary Meyers  Meat  Market,\nseems to be back in vogue; enter the cost of the item in the cash\nregister and check for mistakes when the receipt is produced.\n\nI  haven't  found one store in my neighborhood that  still  takes\ncredit cards.  Have you noticed the near disdain you receive when\nyou try to pay with a credit card?  Its real and perceived  value\nhas been flushed right down the toilet.\n\nNot  that  they don't trust my well known face and name,  but  my\ncredit  cards  are  as suspect as are  everybody's.   Even  check\ncashing is scarce.  Seems like the best currency is that old time\nstand-by,  cash.  If you can make it to the bank.  The ATM at  my\ncorner has been rented out to a flower peddler.\n\nAll  of  this  is happening in  reasonably  affluent  Westchester\nCounty.  And in impoverished East Los Angeles and in Detroit  and\nMiami  and  Boston and Atlanta and Dallas as well as  a  thousand\nOshkosh's.   America  is  painfully learning what  life  is  like\nwithout automation.\n\n* * * * *\n\nOSO Puts Up Foster Defense Costs\nEffort At Saving Face\n     Miami Herald\n\nHackers Hacked Off\nAccuse Government of Complicity\n     Atlanta Constitution\n\nMicrowaves Go Haywire\nTimers Tick Too Long\n     Newsday\n\n1 Million School Computers Sit Idle\nSoftware Companies Slow to Respond\n     Newsweek\n\nFederal Computer Tax Bill Up For Vote\nJohn and Jane Doe Scream 'No'!\n     San Diego Union\n\nCable Shopping Network Off Air 6 Months\n     Clearwater Sun\n\nBankruptcies Soar 600%\n     Money Magazine\n\nBanking At Home Programs On Hold\nUnreliable Communications Blamed\n     Computers In Banking\n\nSlow Vacation Travel Closes Resorts\nBut Disneyland Still Happiest Place on Earth\n     San Diego Tribune\n\n* * * * *\n\n     Hacker Heroes\n     By Scott Mason\n\nI have occasionally wreaked verbal havoc upon the hacker communi-\nty  as a whole, lumping together the good and the bad.

In an  attempt  to  win\ncustomers, banks have installed extra security measures to insure\nthat  the electronic repositories that store billions of  dollars\nare adequately protected; something that banks and the ABA openly\nadmit has been overlooked until recently.\n\nThe  new marketing techniques of promoting security are  not  the\nexclusive  domain of the financial community.

The Times made Scott the  most\ngenerous  tenure  offers in a generation of  writers,  and  Scott\nrecognized  the fairness of the offers.  It was not now, nor  had\nit ever been a question of money, though.\n\n\"What's next?\"\n\n\"The book, I suppose.  The Trial of Miles Foster.\"\n\n\"And then back to the Times?\"\n\n\"Maybe,  maybe.   I haven't given it much  thought,\"  Scott  said\nwatering  down the coals to reduce the intensity of the  barbecue\ninferno he had created.  \"I promised to help out once in a while.\nOfficially they call it a sabbatical.\"\n\n\"How long do you think you can hold out on this rock before going\nnuts?\"\n\n\"We've  managed  pretty well, so far.\"  Scott said  admiring  his\nbride whose phenomenal physical beauty was tightly wrapped in the\nhigh  French cut one piece bathing suit that Scott  insisted  she\nwear in honor of their more conservative guests.  Tyrone, he  was\nsure, would not have minded Sonja's nudity, but Arlene would have\nbeen on the next flight to Boston and her parents.\n\n\"Three months so far, and nine months to go.  I think I can  take\nit,\" he said staring at Sonja and motioning to the view.\n\nTyrone  silently conveyed understanding for Scott's choice of  an\nisland  retreat  to get away from it all.  But  Tyrone's  choices\ndemanded his presence within driving distance of civilization.\n\n\"So  the  bureau  wasn't too upset about  your  leaving?\"   Scott\nchanged the subject.\n\n\"I guess not,\" Tyrone said laughing.  \"I was approaching mandato-\nry  anyway and I'd become too big a pain in their  asses.   Using\nyour  hackers  didn't  endear me to too many  of  the  Director's\nstaff.\"\n\n\"What about your friend?\"\n\n\"You mean Bob Burnson?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the guy we met at Ebbett's . . .\"\n\n\"He got his promotion right after I left.  I guess I was  holding\nhim back,\" Tyrone said with tongue in cheek.  \"On the other hand,\nI  could have stayed and really made his life  miserable.   We're\nboth at peace. Best of all? Still friends.\"\n\n\"I  have  to say, though, I never thought you'd go  through  with\nit,\"  said  Scott  turning the steaks.  \"You and  the  Bureau,  a\nthirty year affair.\"\n\n\"Not quite thirty . . .\"\n\n\"Whatever.   You've certainly built up a practice and a  half  in\nsix months.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" chuckled Tyrone.  \"Like you, I never planned on  becoming\na  big  player . . .Christ.  Who ever thought that  Computer  Law\nwould be the next Cabbage Patch Doll of the courts?\"  Tyrone  saw\nthe smirk in Scott's face.  \"O.K., you did.  Yes, you predicted a\nmess in the courts.  Yes, you did Mr. Wisenheimer.  I just saw it\nas a neat little extension of constitutional law and then whammo!\nAll of sudden, computer litigation is the hip place to be.  Every\ntype of lawsuit you predicted is somewhere in the legal system  -\nSEC  suits, copyright suits, privacy suits, theft of data,  theft\nof service.\"\n\n\"Sounds like everyone who was scared to admit they had a  problem\nin the past is going balls to the wall.\"\n\n\"The  Japanese  lawyers  are living their  worst  nightmare:  OSO\nIndustries is up to top of its colon with lawsuits, including one\nasking for OSO to be denied any access to the American market for\n100 years.\"\n\nScott whistled long and loud, then laughed.  \"And that's fun?\"\n\n\"You're goddamned right, it's fun,\" Ty asserted, popping  another\nbeer from the poolside cooler.  \"It's a shit load more  interest-\ning  that rotting here,\" he spread his arms to embrace  the  lush\nbeauty from their 1500 foot high aerie.  \"How much sun and  peace\nand  quiet  and sex and water and beach can one  man  take?\"   He\nspoke  loudly,  like a Southern Spiritual  Minister.   \"Too  much\nscuba  diving  and  swimming and sailing and  sunsets  and  black\nstarry  nights can be bad for your health.  This is  a  goddamned\nHedonist's Heaven.\"  He brought his hands to his side and gave  a\nresigned sigh.  \"I guess if you can stomach this kind of life.\"\n\n\"Jealous?\"  Scott asked gently.  He knew about Arlene's reticence\nto  try anything new, out of the ordinary.  She was very  pleased\nwith her life in Westchester.  She felt that knowing someone  who\nlived  in Paradise whom she could visit once a year was  new-ness\nenough.\n\n\"No, man,\"  Tyrone said genuinely, speaking as himself again.  \"I\ngot  exactly  what I wanted.\"  He cocked his head  at  the  pool,\nwhere  Arlene seemed more relaxed than she had in years.   \"Can't\nyou  see?  She's miserable, but she's mine.  Scott, you've  lived\nyour fantasy, made a difference.  Now, it's my turn.\"\n\nScott  looked over at Arlene. \"Hey, shit for brains,\" he said  to\nTyrone.   \"She's no slouch.  It's what the hell she's doing  with\nyou  I  never understood.\"  Scott lunged at  Tyrone's  attention-\ngetting sized abdomen with the steak fork.\n\n\"Nice and juicy,\" retorted Tyrone, patting his prominent stomach.\n\n\"You're  not  my type.  I like mine lean.  I cut  off  the  fat,\"\nScott  barbed.  Before Tyrone could get in his jibe Scott  called\nout, \"Steaks' on.  Outside black, inside mooing.\"\n\nThe  girls  smacked  their lips in anticipation and  sat  in  the\nelegant  all weather PVC furniture.  A red sailor's  delight  sun\nwas  mere  inches  above the horizon, setting to  the  west  over\nHassel  and Water Islands which provide umbrage to  Blue  Beard's\nharbor of choice.\n\nThe  men were providing all services this evening and the  ladies\nwere luxuriating in this rare opportunity.  Little did they know,\nor  little  did they let on, that they knew the men  enjoyed  the\nopportunity  to demonstrate their culinary skills without  female\ninterference.  Beside, thought Scott, it was the maid's day off.\n\n\"Seriously,  though,\"  Tyrone  said quietly as  Scott  piled  the\nplates  with steaks and potatoes.  \"I know you better than  that.\nI  don't see how you can do nothing.  You don't know how  to  sit\nyour  ass  still  for ten minutes.  It's  not  your  personality.\nDon't you agree Arlene?\"\n\n\"Yes dear,\" she said, still talking to Sonja.\n\n\"And that room you call your office, Jesus.  You have more equip-\nment in there than  . . .\"\n\n\"It looks like more than it is . . .\" Scott downplayed the point.\n\"Mainly communications.  The local phone company is a joke, so  I\ninstalled an uplink.  No big deal.\"\n\n\"C'mon,  man,  I just can't see you sitting  on  the  sidelines.\"\nTyrone stressed the word 'you'.  \"Not with what's happening  now?\nThere must be a thousand stories out there . . .\"\n\n\"And a thousand and one reporters.  Too much noise, too busy  for\nmy liking.  After the Homosoto story, if there's one luxury  I've\nlearned to live with, it's that I can pick and choose what I do.\"\nScott spoke much too reserved for the Scott Mason Tyrone knew.\n\n\"Aha!  So  you are up to something.  I knew it. I gave  you  one,\nmaybe two months, but I never figured you'd last three.\"\n\nThey carried the four plates laden with steaks and potatoes  over\nto  the  table where their spouses waited.  Fresh  beers  awaited\ntheir much appreciated efforts.\n\n\"I  do  get a little itchy and I read a lot.\"  Tyrone  glared  at\nScott  with  disbelief.   \"No really, just  a  little  research,\"\nlaughed Scott in mock defense.  \"O.K., I received a call, and  it\nsounded kind of interesting, so I've been looking into it.\"\n\n\"Poking around, here and there and everywhere?\"\n\n\"Kinda, just following up a few leads.\"\n\n\"Just a few?\"\n\n\"Well, maybe more than a few,\" Scott admitted.\n\n\"When  did this little project begin?\" Tyrone  asked  accusingly.\nHe suspected Scott was hiding a detail or two.\n\n\"It's not really a project . . .\"\n\n\"Don't skirt the issue.  When?\"\n\nScott lowered his head.  \"Two weeks after we got here.\"\n\nTyrone  stifled what might otherwise have become a volcanic  roar\nof laughter.  \"Two weeks?  Ha!\" Tyrone needled.  \"You only lasted\ntwo  weeks?   How  did Sonja feel about that?\"   He  looked  over\nScott's at better half listen in.\n\n\"Ah, well, she sort of insisted . . .\"\n\n\"You drove her nuts? In two weeks?\"   Sonja shook her head vigor-\nously in agreement but kept speaking to Arlene Duncan.\n\n\"Kind  of;  semi-sorta-kinda-maybe.\"   Scott  grinned   impishly.\n\"But, yeah, I have been working on something.\"  He couldn't  keep\nit to himself.\n\n\"Dare I ask?\"\n\n\"Off the record?\"  Scott sounded insistent.\n\n\"This  is a twist. How about attorney-client  privilege?\"  Tyrone\nasked.   Scott didn't disagree.  \"Good,\" said Tyrone. \"Give me  a\ndollar.  That's my yearly fee.\"\n\nScott  complied, finding a soaking wet dollar bill in his   swim-\nming trunks.  He laid it next to Tyrone's plate.\n\n\"Well?\" Tyrone asked with great interest.\n\n\"Well,   I discovered we never developed the A-Bomb to end  World\nWar II.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"Someone gave it to us.\"\n\n****************************************************************\n\n                         THE END\n\n\n\nWe  appreciate your support of NOVEL-ON-THE-NET  Shareware.
