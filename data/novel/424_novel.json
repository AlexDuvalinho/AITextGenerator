And the girl\n  Was caught in the public whirl.\n  Do you say \"She gave consent:\n  Life drunk, she was content\n  With beasts that her fire could please?\"\n  But she did not choose disease\n  Of mind and nerves and breath.\n  She was trapped to a slow, foul death.\n  The door was watched so well,\n  That the steep dark stair to hell\n  Was the only escaping way . . .\n  \"She gave consent,\" you say?\n\n  Some think she was meek and good,\n  Only lost in the wood\n  Of youth, and deceived in man\n  When the hunger of sex began\n  That ties the husband and wife\n  To the end in a strong fond life.\n  Her captor, by chance was one\n  Of those whose passion was done,\n  A cold fierce worm of the sea\n  Enslaving for you and me.\n  The wages the poor must take\n  Have forced them to serve this snake.\n  Yea, half-paid girls must go\n  For bread to his pit below.\n  What hangman shall wait his host\n  Of butchers from coast to coast,\n  New York to the Golden Gate--\n  The merger of death and fate,\n  Lust-kings with a careful plan\n  Clean-cut, American?\n\n  In liberty's name we cry\n  For these women about to die.\n\n  O mothers who failed to tell\n  The mazes of heaven and hell,\n  Who failed to advise, implore\n  Your daughters at Love's strange door,\n  What will you do this day?\n  Your dear ones are hidden away,\n  As good as chained to the bed,\n  Hid like the mad, or the dead:--\n  The glories of endless years\n  Drowned in their harlot-tears:\n  The children they hoped to bear,\n  Grandchildren strong and fair,\n  The life for ages to be,\n  Cut off like a blasted tree,\n  Murdered in filth in a day,\n  Somehow, by the merchant gay!\n\n  In liberty's name we cry\n  For these women about to die.\n\n  What shall be said of a state\n  Where traps for the white brides wait?\n  Of sellers of drink who play\n  The game for the extra pay?\n  Of statesmen in league with all\n  Who hope for the girl-child's fall?\n  Of banks where hell's money is paid\n  And Pharisees all afraid\n  Of pandars that help them sin?\n  When will our wrath begin?\n\n\n\n\n  Where is David, the Next King of Israel?\n\n\n  Where is David? . . .  O God's people,\n  Saul has passed, the good and great.\n  Mourn for Saul the first-anointed--\n  Head and shoulders o'er the state.\n\n  He was found among the Prophets:\n  Judge and monarch, merged in one.\n  But the wars of Saul are ended\n  And the works of Saul are done.\n\n  Where is David, ruddy shepherd,\n  God's boy-king for Israel?\n  Mystic, ardent, dowered with beauty,\n  Singing where still waters dwell?\n\n  Prophet, find that destined minstrel\n  Wandering on the range to-day,\n  Driving sheep and crooning softly\n  Psalms that cannot pass away.\n\n  \"David waits,\" the prophet answers,\n  \"In a black notorious den,\n  In a cave upon the border\n  With four hundred outlaw men.\n\n  \"He is fair, and loved of women,\n  Mighty-hearted, born to sing:\n  Thieving, weeping, erring, praying,\n  Radiant royal rebel-king.\n\n  \"He will come with harp and psaltry,\n  Quell his troop of convict swine,\n  Quell his mad-dog roaring rascals,\n  Witching them with words divine--\n\n       \"They will ram the walls of Zion!\n       They will win us Salem hill,\n       All for David, Shepherd David--\n       Singing like a mountain rill!\"\n\n\n\n\n  On Reading Omar Khayyam\n\n  [During an anti-saloon campaign, in central Illinois.]\n\n\n  In the midst of the battle I turned,\n  (For the thunders could flourish without me)\n  And hid by a rose-hung wall,\n  Forgetting the murder about me;\n  And wrote, from my wound, on the stone,\n  In mirth, half prayer, half play:--\n  \"Send me a picture book,\n  Send me a song, to-day.\"\n\n  I saw him there by the wall\n  When I scarce had written the line,\n  In the enemy's colors dressed\n  And the serpent-standard of wine\n  Writhing its withered length\n  From his ghostly hands o'er the ground,\n  And there by his shadowy breast\n  The glorious poem I found.\n\n  This was his world-old cry:\n  Thus read the famous prayer:\n  \"Wine, wine, wine and flowers\n  And cup-bearers always fair!\"\n  'Twas a book of the snares of earth\n  Bordered in gold and blue,\n  And I read each line to the wind\n  And read to the roses too:\n  And they nodded their womanly heads\n  And told to the wall just why\n  For wine of the earth men bleed,\n  Kingdoms and empires die.\n  I envied the grape stained sage:\n  (The roses were praising him.)\n  The ways of the world seemed good\n  And the glory of heaven dim.\n  I envied the endless kings\n  Who found great pearls in the mire,\n  Who bought with the nation's life\n  The cup of delicious fire.\n\n  But the wine of God came down,\n  And I drank it out of the air.\n  (Fair is the serpent-cup,\n  But the cup of God more fair.)\n  The wine of God came down\n  That makes no drinker to weep.\n  And I went back to battle again\n  Leaving the singer asleep.\n\n\n\n\n  The Beggar's Valentine\n\n\n  Kiss me and comfort my heart\n   Maiden honest and fine.\n  I am the pilgrim boy\n   Lame, but hunting the shrine;\n\n  Fleeing away from the sweets,\n   Seeking the dust and rain,\n  Sworn to the staff and road,\n   Scorning pleasure and pain;\n\n  Nevertheless my mouth\n   Would rest like a bird an hour\n  And find in your curls a nest\n   And find in your breast a bower:\n\n  Nevertheless my eyes\n   Would lose themselves in your own,\n  Rivers that seek the sea,\n   Angels before the throne:\n\n  Kiss me and comfort my heart,\n   For love can never be mine:\n  Passion, hunger and pain,\n   These are the only wine\n\n  Of the pilgrim bound to the road.\n   He would rob no man of his own.\n  Your heart is another's I know,\n   Your honor is his alone.\n\n  The feasts of a long drawn love,\n   The feasts of a wedded life,\n  The harvests of patient years,\n   And hearthstone and children and wife:\n\n  These are your lords I know.\n   These can never be mine--\n  This is the price I pay\n   For the foolish search for the shrine:\n\n  This is the price I pay\n   For the joy of my midnight prayers,\n  Kneeling beneath the moon\n   With hills for my altar stairs;\n\n  This is the price I pay\n   For the throb of the mystic wings,\n  When the dove of God comes down\n   And beats round my heart and sings;\n\n  This is the price I pay\n   For the light I shall some day see\n  At the ends of the infinite earth\n   When truth shall come to me.\n\n  And what if my body die\n   Before I meet the truth?\n  The road is dear, more dear\n   Than love or life or youth.\n\n  The road, it is the road,\n   Mystical, endless, kind,\n  Mother of visions vast,\n   Mother of soul and mind;\n\n  Mother of all of me\n   But the blood that cries for a mate--\n  That cries for a farewell kiss\n   From the child of God at the gate.\n\n\n\n\n  Honor Among Scamps\n\n\n  We are the smirched.  Queen Honor is the spotless.\n  We slept thro' wars where Honor could not sleep.\n  We were faint-hearted.  Honor was full-valiant.\n  We kept a silence Honor could not keep.\n\n  Yet this late day we make a song to praise her.\n  We, codeless, will yet vindicate her code.\n  She who was mighty, walks with us, the beggars.\n  The merchants drive her out upon the road.\n\n  She makes a throne of sod beside our campfire.\n  We give the maiden-queen our rags and tears.\n  A battered, rascal guard have rallied round her,\n  To keep her safe until the better years.\n\n\n\n\n  The Gamblers\n\n\n  Life's a jail where men have common lot.\n  Gaunt the one who has, and who has not.\n  All our treasures neither less nor more,\n  Bread alone comes thro' the guarded door.\n  Cards are foolish in this jail, I think,\n  Yet they play for shoes, for drabs and drink.\n  She, my lawless, sharp-tongued gypsy maid\n  Will not scorn with me this jail-bird trade,\n  Pets some fox-eyed boy who turns the trick,\n  Tho' he win a button or a stick,\n  Pencil, garter, ribbon, corset-lace--\n  HIS the glory, MINE is the disgrace.\n\n  Sweet, I'd rather lose than win despite\n  Love of hearty words and maids polite.\n  \"Love's a gamble,\" say you.  I deny.\n  Love's a gift.  I love you till I die.\n  Gamblers fight like rats.  I will not play.\n  All I ever had I gave away.\n  All I ever coveted was peace\n  Such as comes if we have jail release.\n  Cards are puzzles, tho' the prize be gold,\n  Cards help not the bread that tastes of mold,\n  Cards dye not your hair to black more deep,\n  Cards make not the children cease to weep.\n\n  Scorned, I sit with half shut eyes all day--\n  Watch the cataract of sunshine play\n  Down the wall, and dance upon the floor.\n  Sun, come down and break the dungeon door!\n  Of such gold dust could I make a key,--\n  Turn the bolt--how soon we would be free!\n  Over borders we would hurry on\n  Safe by sunrise farms, and springs of dawn,\n  Wash our wounds and jail stains there at last,\n  Azure rivers flowing, flowing past.\n  GOD HAS GREAT ESTATES JUST PAST THE LINE,\n  GREEN FARMS FOR ALL, AND MEAT AND CORN AND WINE.\n\n\n\n\n  On the Road to Nowhere\n\n\n  On the road to nowhere\n  What wild oats did you sow\n  When you left your father's house\n  With your cheeks aglow?\n  Eyes so strained and eager\n  To see what you might see?\n  Were you thief or were you fool\n  Or most nobly free?\n\n  Were the tramp-days knightly,\n  True sowing of wild seed?\n  Did you dare to make the songs\n  Vanquished workmen need?\n  Did you waste much money\n  To deck a leper's feast?\n  Love the truth, defy the crowd\n  Scandalize the priest?\n  On the road to nowhere\n  What wild oats did you sow?\n  Stupids find the nowhere-road\n  Dusty, grim and slow.\n\n  Ere their sowing's ended\n  They turn them on their track,\n  Look at the caitiff craven wights\n  Repentant, hurrying back!\n  Grown ashamed of nowhere,\n  Of rags endured for years,\n  Lust for velvet in their hearts,\n  Pierced with Mammon's spears,\n  All but a few fanatics\n  Give up their darling goal,\n  Seek to be as others are,\n  Stultify the soul.\n  Reapings now confront them,\n  Glut them, or destroy,\n  Curious seeds, grain or weeds\n  Sown with awful joy.\n  Hurried is their harvest,\n  They make soft peace with men.\n  Pilgrims pass.  They care not,\n  Will not tramp again.\n\n  O nowhere, golden nowhere!\n  Sages and fools go on\n  To your chaotic ocean,\n  To your tremendous dawn.\n  Far in your fair dream-haven,\n  Is nothing or is all . . .\n  They press on, singing, sowing\n  Wild deeds without recall!\n\n\n\n\n  Upon Returning to the Country Road\n\n\n  Even the shrewd and bitter,\n  Gnarled by the old world's greed,\n  Cherished the stranger softly\n  Seeing his utter need.\n  Shelter and patient hearing,\n  These were their gifts to him,\n  To the minstrel, grimly begging\n  As the sunset-fire grew dim.\n  The rich said \"You are welcome.\"\n  Yea, even the rich were good.\n  How strange that in their feasting\n  His songs were understood!\n  The doors of the poor were open,\n  The poor who had wandered too,\n  Who had slept with ne'er a roof-tree\n  Under the wind and dew.\n  The minds of the poor were open,\n  Their dark mistrust was dead.\n  They loved his wizard stories,\n  They bought his rhymes with bread.\n  Those were his days of glory,\n  Of faith in his fellow-men.\n  Therefore, to-day the singer\n  Turns beggar once again.\n\n\n\n\n  The Angel and the Clown\n\n\n  I saw wild domes and bowers\n  And smoking incense towers\n  And mad exotic flowers\n  In Illinois.\n  Where ragged ditches ran\n  Now springs of Heaven began\n  Celestial drink for man\n  In Illinois.\n\n  There stood beside the town\n  Beneath its incense-crown\n  An angel and a clown\n  In Illinois.\n  He was as Clowns are:\n  She was snow and star\n  With eyes that looked afar\n  In Illinois.\n\n  I asked, \"How came this place\n  Of antique Asian grace\n  Amid our callow race\n  In Illinois?\"\n  Said Clown and Angel fair:\n  \"By laughter and by prayer,\n  By casting off all care\n  In Illinois.\"\n\n\n\n\n  Springfield Magical\n\n\n  In this, the City of my Discontent,\n  Sometimes there comes a whisper from the grass,\n  \"Romance, Romance--is here.  No Hindu town\n  Is quite so strange.  No Citadel of Brass\n  By Sinbad found, held half such love and hate;\n  No picture-palace in a picture-book\n  Such webs of Friendship, Beauty, Greed and Fate!\"\n\n  In this, the City of my Discontent,\n  Down from the sky, up from the smoking deep\n  Wild legends new and old burn round my bed\n  While trees and grass and men are wrapped in sleep.\n  Angels come down, with Christmas in their hearts,\n  Gentle, whimsical, laughing, heaven-sent;\n  And, for a day, fair Peace have given me\n  In this, the City of my Discontent!\n\n\n\n\n  Incense\n\n\n  Think not that incense-smoke has had its day.\n  My friends, the incense-time has but begun.\n  Creed upon creed, cult upon cult shall bloom,\n  Shrine after shrine grow gray beneath the sun.\n\n  And mountain-boulders in our aged West\n  Shall guard the graves of hermits truth-endowed:\n  And there the scholar from the Chinese hills\n  Shall do deep honor, with his wise head bowed.\n\n  And on our old, old plains some muddy stream,\n  Dark as the Ganges, shall, like that strange tide--\n  (Whispering mystery to half the earth)--\n  Gather the praying millions to its side,\n\n  And flow past halls with statues in white stone\n  To saints unborn to-day, whose lives of grace\n  Shall make one shining, universal church\n  Where all Faiths kneel, as brothers, in one place.\n\n\n\n\n  The Wedding of the Rose and the Lotos\n\n\n  The wide Pacific waters\n   And the Atlantic meet.\n  With cries of joy they mingle,\n  In tides of love they greet.\n  Above the drowned ages\n  A wind of wooing blows:--\n  The red rose woos the lotos,\n  The lotos woos the rose . . .\n\n  The lotos conquered Egypt.\n   The rose was loved in Rome.\n  Great India crowned the lotos:\n  (Britain the rose's home).\n  Old China crowned the lotos,\n  They crowned it in Japan.\n  But Christendom adored the rose\n  Ere Christendom began . . .\n\n  The lotos speaks of slumber:\n  The rose is as a dart.\n   The lotos is Nirvana:\n  The rose is Mary's heart.\n  The rose is deathless, restless,\n  The splendor of our pain:\n   The flush and fire of labor\n  That builds, not all in vain. . . .\n\n  The genius of the lotos\n  Shall heal earth's too-much fret.\n  The rose, in blinding glory,\n  Shall waken Asia yet.\n  Hail to their loves, ye peoples!\n  Behold, a world-wind blows,\n  That aids the ivory lotos\n  To wed the red red rose!\n\n\n\n\n  King Arthur's Men Have Come Again\n\n  [Written while a field-worker in the Anti-Saloon League of Illinois.]\n\n\n  King Arthur's men have come again.\n  They challenge everywhere\n  The foes of Christ's Eternal Church.\n  Her incense crowns the air.\n  The heathen knighthood cower and curse\n  To hear the bugles ring,\n  BUT SPEARS ARE SET, THE CHARGE IS ON,\n  WISE ARTHUR SHALL BE KING!\n\n  And Cromwell's men have come again,\n  I meet them in the street.\n  Stern but in this--no way of thorns\n  Shall snare the children's feet.\n  The reveling foemen wreak but waste,\n  A sodden poisonous band.\n  FIERCE CROMWELL BUILDS THE FLOWER-BRIGHT TOWNS,\n  AND A MORE SUNLIT LAND!\n\n  And Lincoln's men have come again.\n  Up from the South he flayed,\n  The grandsons of his foes arise\n  In his own cause arrayed.\n  They rise for freedom and clean laws\n  High laws, that shall endure.\n  OUR GOD ESTABLISHES HIS ARM\n  AND MAKES THE BATTLE SURE!\n\n\n\n\n  Foreign Missions in Battle Array\n\n\n  An endless line of splendor,\n  These troops with heaven for home,\n  With creeds they go from Scotland,\n  With incense go from Rome.\n  These, in the name of Jesus,\n  Against the dark gods stand,\n  They gird the earth with valor,\n  They heed their King's command.\n\n  Onward the line advances,\n  Shaking the hills with power,\n  Slaying the hidden demons,\n  The lions that devour.\n  No bloodshed in the wrestling,--\n  But souls new-born arise--\n  The nations growing kinder,\n  The child-hearts growing wise.\n\n  What is the final ending?\n  The issue, can we know?\n  Will Christ outlive Mohammed?\n  Will Kali's altar go?\n  This is our faith tremendous,--\n  Our wild hope, who shall scorn,--\n  That in the name of Jesus\n  The world shall be reborn!\n\n\n\n\n  Star of My Heart\n\n\n  Star of my heart, I follow from afar.\n  Sweet Love on high, lead on where shepherds are,\n  Where Time is not, and only dreamers are.\n  Star from of old, the Magi-Kings are dead\n  And a foolish Saxon seeks the manger-bed.\n  O lead me to Jehovah's child\n  Across this dreamland lone and wild,\n  Then will I speak this prayer unsaid,\n  And kiss his little haloed head--\n  \"My star and I, we love thee, little child.\"\n\n  Except the Christ be born again to-night\n  In dreams of all men, saints and sons of shame,\n  The world will never see his kingdom bright.\n  Stars of all hearts, lead onward thro' the night\n  Past death-black deserts, doubts without a name,\n  Past hills of pain and mountains of new sin\n  To that far sky where mystic

Morning,\n  An Indian Maiden wove,\n  Intertwining subtilely\n  Wands from a willow grove\n  Beside the Sangamon--\n  Rude stream of Dreamland Town.\n  She bound them to my shoulders\n  With fingers golden-brown.\n  The wings were part of me;\n  The willow-wands were hot.\n  Pulses from my heart\n  Healed each bruise and spot\n  Of the morning-glory buds,\n  Beginning to unfold\n  Beneath her burning song of suns untold.\n\n\n      The Indian Girl Tells the Hero Where to Go to Get the Laughing Bell\n\n  \"To the farthest star of all,\n  Go, make a moment's raid.\n  To the west--escape the earth\n  Before your pennons fade!\n  West! west! o'ertake the night\n  That flees the morning sun.\n  There's a path between the stars--\n  A black and silent one.\n  O tremble when you near\n  The smallest star that sings:\n  Only the farthest star\n  Is cool for willow wings.\n\n  \"There's a sky within the west--\n  There's a sky beyond the skies\n  Where only one star shines--\n  The Star of Laughing Bells--\n  In Chaos-land it lies;\n  Cold as morning-dew,\n  A gray and tiny boat\n  Moored on Chaos-shore,\n  Where nothing else can float\n  But the Wings of the Morning strong\n  And the lilt of laughing song\n  From many a ruddy throat:\n\n  \"For the Tree of Laughing Bells\n  Grew from a bleeding seed\n  Planted mid enchantment\n  Played on a harp and reed:\n  Darkness was the harp--\n  Chaos-wind the reed;\n  The fruit of the tree is a bell, blood-red--\n  The seed was the heart of a fairy, dead.\n  Part of the bells of the Laughing Tree\n  Fell to-day at a blast from the reed.\n  Bring a fallen bell to me.\n  Go!\" the maiden said.\n  \"For the bell will quench our memory,\n  Our hope,\n  Our borrowed sorrow;\n  We will have no thirst for yesterday,\n  No thought for

the Universe,\n  Thro' the West\n  To Chaos-night.\n\n\n      He Nears the Goal\n\n  How the red bells rang\n  As I neared the Chaos-shore!\n  As I flew across to the end of the West\n  The young bells rang and rang\n  Above the Chaos roar,\n  And the Wings of the Morning\n  Beat in tune\n  And bore me like a bird along--\n  And the nearing star turned to a moon--\n  Gray moon, with a brow of red--\n  Gray moon with a golden song.\n  Like a diver after pearls\n  I plunged to that stifling floor.\n  It was wide as a giant's wheat-field\n  An icy, wind-washed shore.\n  O laughing, proud, but trembling star!\n  O wind that wounded sore!\n\n\n      He Climbs the Hill Where the Tree Grows\n\n  On--\n  Thro' the gleaming gray\n  I ran to the storm and clang--\n  To the red, red hill where the great tree swayed--\n  And scattered bells like autumn leaves.\n  How the red bells rang!\n  My breath within my breast\n  Was held like a diver's breath--\n  The leaves were tangled locks of gray--\n  The boughs of the tree were white and gray,\n  Shaped like scythes of Death.\n  The boughs of the tree would sweep and sway--\n  Sway like scythes of Death.\n  But it was beautiful!\n  I knew that all was well.\n  A thousand bells from a thousand boughs\n  Each moment bloomed and fell.\n  On the hill of the wind-swept tree\n  There were no bells asleep;\n  They sang beneath my trailing wings\n  Like rivers sweet and steep.\n  Deep rock-clefts before my feet\n  Mighty chimes did keep\n  And little choirs did keep.\n\n\n      He Receives the Bells\n\n       Honeyed, small and fair,\n       Like flowers, in flowery lands--\n       Like little maidens' hands--\n       Two bells fell in my hair,\n       Two bells caressed my hair.\n       I pressed them to my purple lips\n       In the strangling Chaos-air.\n\n\n      He Starts on the Return Journey\n\n  On desperate wings and strong,\n  Two bells within my breast,\n  I breathed again, I breathed again--\n  West of the Universe--\n  West of the skies of the West.\n  Into the black toward home,\n  And never a star in sight,\n  By Faith that is blind I took my way\n  With my two bosomed blossoms gay\n  Till a speck in the East was the Milky way:\n  Till starlit was the night.\n  And the bells had quenched all memory--\n  All hope--\n  All borrowed sorrow:\n  I had no thirst for yesterday,\n  No thought for to-morrow.\n  Like hearts within my breast\n  The bells would throb to me\n  And drown the siren stars\n  That sang enticingly;\n  My heart became a bell--\n  Three bells were in my breast,\n  Three hearts to comfort me.\n  We reached the daytime happily--\n  We reached the earth with glee.\n  In an hour, in an hour it was done!\n  The wings in their morning flight\n  Were a thousand times ten thousand times\n  More swift than beams of light.\n\n\n      He Gives What He Won to the Indian Girl\n\n  I panted in the grassy wood;\n  I kissed the Indian Maid\n  As she took my wings from me:\n  With all the grace I could\n  I gave two throbbing bells to her\n  From the foot of the Laughing Tree.\n  And one she pressed to her golden breast\n  And one, gave back to me.\n\n  From Lilies of the valley--\n  See them fade.\n  From poppy-blooms all frayed,\n  From dandelions gray with care,\n  From pansy-faces, worn and torn,\n  From morning-glories--\n  See them fade--\n  From all things fragile, faint and fair\n  Are the Wings of the Morning made!\n\n\n\n\n     Sweethearts of the Year\n\n\n      Sweetheart Spring\n\n  Our Sweetheart, Spring, came softly,\n  Her gliding hands were fire,\n  Her lilac breath upon our cheeks\n  Consumed us with desire.\n\n  By her our God began to build,\n  Began to sow and till.\n  He laid foundations in our loves\n  For every good and ill.\n  We asked Him not for blessing,\n  We asked Him not for pain--\n  Still, to the just and unjust\n  He sent His fire and rain.\n\n\n      Sweetheart Summer\n\n  We prayed not, yet she came to us,\n  The silken, shining one,\n  On Jacob's noble ladder\n  Descended from the sun.\n  She reached our town of Every Day,\n  Our dry and dusty sod--\n  We prayed not, yet she brought to us\n  The misty wine of God.\n\n\n      Sweetheart Autumn\n\n  The woods were black and crimson,\n  The frost-bit flowers were dead,\n  But Sweetheart Indian Summer came\n  With love-winds round her head.\n  While fruits God-given and splendid\n  Belonged to her domain:\n  Baskets of corn in perfect ear\n  And grapes with purple stain,\n  The treacherous winds persuaded her\n  Spring Love was in the wood\n  Altho' the end of love was hers--\n  Fruition, Motherhood.\n\n\n      Sweetheart Winter\n\n  We had done naught of service\n  To win our Maker's praise.\n  Yet Sweetheart Winter came to us\n  To gild our waning days.\n  Down Jacob's winding ladder\n  She came from Sunshine Town,\n  Bearing the sparkling mornings\n  And clouds of silver-brown;\n  Bearing the seeds of Springtime.\n  Upon her snowy seas\n  Bearing the fairy star-flowers\n  For baby Christmas trees.\n\n\n\n\n     The Sorceress!\n\n\n  I asked her, \"Is Aladdin's lamp\n  Hidden anywhere?\"\n  \"Look into your heart,\" she said,\n  \"Aladdin's lamp is there.\"\n\n  She took my heart with glowing hands.\n  It burned to dust and air\n  And smoke and rolling thistledown\n  Blowing everywhere.\n\n  \"Follow the thistledown,\" she said,\n  \"Till doomsday, if you dare,\n  Over the hills and far away.\n  Aladdin's lamp is there.\"\n\n\n\n\n     Caught in a Net\n\n\n  Upon her breast her hands and hair\n   Were tangled all together.\n  The moon of June forbade me not--\n   The golden night time weather\n  In balmy sighs commanded me\n   To kiss them like a feather.\n\n  Her looming hair, her burning hands,\n   Were tangled black and white.\n  My face I buried there.  I pray--\n   So far from her to-night--\n  For grace, to dream I kiss her soul\n   Amid the black and white.\n\n\n\n\n     Eden in Winter\n\n  [Supposed to be chanted to some rude instrument at a modern fireplace]\n\n\n  Chant we the story now\n  Tho' in a house we sleep;\n  Tho' by a hearth of coals\n  Vigil to-night we keep.\n  Chant we the story now,\n  Of the vague love we knew\n  When I from out the sea\n  Rose to the feet of you.\n\n  Bird from the cliffs you came,\n  Flew thro' the snow to me,\n  Facing the icy blast\n  There by the icy sea.\n  How did I reach your feet?\n  Why should I--at the end\n  Hold out half-frozen hands\n  Dumbly to you my friend?\n  Ne'er had I woman seen,\n  Ne'er had I seen a flame.\n  There you piled fagots on,\n  Heat rose--the blast to tame.\n  There by the cave-door dark,\n  Comforting me you cried--\n  Wailed o'er my wounded knee,\n  Wept for my rock-torn side.\n\n  Up from the South I trailed--\n  Left regions fierce and fair!\n  Left all the jungle-trees,\n  Left the red tiger's lair.\n  Dream led, I scarce knew why,\n  Into your North I trod--\n  Ne'er had I known the snow,\n  Or the frost-blasted sod.\n\n  O how the flakes came down!\n  O how the fire burned high!\n  Strange thing to see he was,\n  Thro' his dry twigs would fly,\n  Creep there awhile and sleep--\n  Then wake and bark for fight--\n  Biting if I too near\n  Came to his eye so bright.\n  Then with a will you fed\n  Wood to his hungry tongue.\n\n  Then he did leap and sing--\n  Dancing the clouds among,\n  Turning the night to noon,\n  Stinging my eyes with light,\n  Making the snow retreat,\n  Making the cave-house bright.\n\n  There were dry fagots piled,\n  Nuts and dry leaves and roots,\n  Stores there of furs and hides,\n  Sweet-barks and grains and fruits.\n  There wrapped in fur we lay,\n  Half-burned, half-frozen still--\n  Ne'er will my soul forget\n  All the night's bitter chill.\n  We had not learned to speak,\n  I was to you a strange\n  Wolfling or wounded fawn,\n  Lost from his forest-range.\n\n  Thirsting for bloody meat,\n  Out at the dawn we went.\n  Weighed with our prey at eve,\n  Home-came we all forespent.\n  Comrades and hunters tried\n  Ere we were maid and man--\n  Not till the spring awoke\n  Laughter and speech began.\n\n  Whining like forest dogs,\n  Rustling like budding trees,\n  Bubbling like thawing springs,\n  Humming like little bees,\n  Crooning like Maytime tides,\n  Chattering parrot words,\n  Crying the panther's cry,\n  Chirping like mating birds--\n  Thus, thus, we learned to speak,\n  Who mid the snows were dumb,\n  Nor did we learn to kiss\n  Until the Spring had come.\n\n\n\n\n     Genesis\n\n\n  I was but a half-grown boy,\n  You were a girl-child slight.\n  Ah, how weary you were!\n  You had led in the bullock-fight . . .\n  We slew the bullock at length\n  With knives and maces of stone.\n  And so your feet were torn,\n  Your lean arms bruised to the bone.\n\n  Perhaps 'twas the slain beast's blood\n  We drank, or a root we ate,\n  Or our reveling evening bath\n  In the fall by the garden gate,\n  But you turned to a witching thing,\n  Side-glancing, and frightened me;\n  You purred like a panther's cub,\n  You sighed like a shell from the sea.\n\n  We knelt.

What did it mean?\n  What of the rose's prayer?\n\n  Down, down where rain has never come\n  They fight in burning graves,\n  Bleeding and drinking blood\n  Within those venom-caves.\n  Blaspheming still the gardener's name,\n  They live and hate and go.\n  I wonder if the gardener heard\n  The rose that told him so?\n\n\n\n\n  A Gospel of Beauty:--\n\n\n       I recited these three poems more than any others\n       in my late mendicant preaching tour through the West.\n       Taken as a triad, they hold in solution my theory\n       of American civilization.\n\n\n\n     The Proud Farmer\n\n  [In memory of E. S. Frazee, Rush County, Indiana]\n\n\n  Into the acres of the newborn state\n  He poured his strength, and plowed his ancient name,\n  And, when the traders followed him, he stood\n  Towering above their furtive souls and tame.\n\n  That brow without a stain, that fearless eye\n  Oft left the passing stranger wondering\n  To find such knighthood in the sprawling land,\n  To see a democrat well-nigh a king.\n\n  He lived with liberal hand, with guests from far,\n  With talk and joke and fellowship to spare,--\n  Watching the wide world's life from sun to sun,\n  Lining his walls with books from everywhere.\n  He read by night, he built his world by day.\n  The farm and house of God to him were one.\n  For forty years he preached and plowed and wrought--\n  A statesman in the fields, who bent to none.\n\n  His plowmen-neighbors were as lords to him.\n  His was an ironside, democratic pride.\n  He served a rigid Christ, but served him well--\n  And, for a lifetime, saved the countryside.\n\n  Here lie the dead, who gave the church their best\n  Under his fiery preaching of the word.\n  They sleep with him beneath the ragged grass . . .\n  The village withers, by his voice unstirred.\n\n  And tho' his tribe be scattered to the wind\n  From the Atlantic to the China sea,\n  Yet do they think of that bright lamp he burned\n  Of family worth and proud integrity.\n\n  And many a sturdy grandchild hears his name\n  In reverence spoken, till he feels akin\n  To all the lion-eyed who built the world--\n  And lion-dreams begin to burn within.\n\n\n\n\n     The Illinois Village\n\n\n  O you who lose the art of hope,\n  Whose temples seem to shrine a lie,\n  Whose sidewalks are but stones of fear,\n  Who weep that Liberty must die,\n  Turn to the little prairie towns,\n  Your higher hope shall yet begin.\n  On every side awaits you there\n  Some gate where glory enters in.\n\n  Yet when I see the flocks of girls,\n  Watching the Sunday train go thro'\n  (As tho' the whole wide world went by)\n  With eyes that long to travel too,\n  I sigh, despite my soul made glad\n  By cloudy dresses and brown hair,\n  Sigh for the sweet life wrenched and torn\n  By thundering commerce, fierce and bare.\n  Nymphs of the wheat these girls should be:\n  Kings of the grove, their lovers strong.\n  Why are they not inspired, aflame?\n  This beauty calls for valiant song--\n  For men to carve these fairy-forms\n  And faces in a fountain-frieze;\n  Dancers that own immortal hours;\n  Painters that work upon their knees;\n  Maids, lovers, friends, so deep in life,\n  So deep in love and poet's deeds,\n  The railroad is a thing disowned,\n  The city but a field of weeds.\n\n  Who can pass a village church\n  By night in these clean prairie lands\n  Without a touch of Spirit-power?\n  So white and fixed and cool it stands--\n  A thing from some strange fairy-town,\n  A pious amaranthine flower,\n  Unsullied by the winds, as pure\n  As jade or marble, wrought this hour:--\n  Rural in form, foursquare and plain,\n  And yet our sister, the new moon,\n  Makes it a praying wizard's dream.\n  The trees that watch at dusty noon\n  Breaking its sharpest lines, veil not\n  The whiteness it reflects from God,\n  Flashing like Spring on many an eye,\n  Making clean flesh, that once was clod.\n\n  Who can pass a district school\n  Without the hope that there may wait\n  Some baby-heart the books shall flame\n  With zeal to make his playmates great,\n  To make the whole wide village gleam\n  A strangely carved celestial gem,\n  Eternal in its beauty-light,\n  The Artist's town of Bethlehem!\n\n\n\n\n     On the Building of Springfield\n\n\n  Let not our town be large, remembering\n  That little Athens was the Muses' home,\n  That Oxford rules the heart of London still,\n  That Florence gave the Renaissance to Rome.\n\n  Record it for the grandson of your son--\n  A city is not builded in a day:\n  Our little town cannot complete her soul\n  Till countless generations pass away.\n\n  Now let each child be joined as to a church\n  To her perpetual hopes, each man ordained:\n  Let every street be made a reverent aisle\n  Where Music grows and Beauty is unchained.\n\n  Let Science and Machinery and Trade\n  Be slaves of her, and make her all in all,\n  Building against our blatant, restless time\n  An unseen, skilful, medieval wall.\n\n  Let every citizen be rich toward God.\n  Let Christ the beggar, teach divinity.\n  Let no man rule who holds his money dear.\n  Let this, our city, be our luxury.\n\n  We should build parks that students from afar\n  Would choose to starve in, rather than go home,\n  Fair little squares, with Phidian ornament,\n  Food for the spirit, milk and honeycomb.\n\n  Songs shall be sung by us in that good day,\n  Songs we have written, blood within the rhyme\n  Beating, as when Old England still was glad,--\n  The purple, rich Elizabethan time.\n\n       .    .    .    .    .\n\n  Say, is my prophecy too fair and far?\n  I only know, unless her faith be high,\n  The soul of this, our Nineveh, is doomed,\n  Our little Babylon will surely die.\n\n  Some city on the breast of Illinois\n  No wiser and no better at the start\n  By faith shall rise redeemed, by faith shall rise\n  Bearing the western glory in her heart.\n\n  The genius of the Maple, Elm and Oak,\n  The secret hidden in each grain of corn,\n  The glory that the prairie angels sing\n  At night when sons of Life and Love are born,\n\n  Born but to struggle, squalid and alone,\n  Broken and wandering in their early years.\n  When will they make our dusty streets their goal,\n  Within our attics hide their sacred tears?\n\n  When will they start our vulgar blood athrill\n  With living language, words that set us free?\n  When will they make a path of beauty clear\n  Between our riches and our liberty?\n\n  We must have many Lincoln-hearted men.\n  A city is not builded in a day.\n  And they must do their work, and come and go\n  While countless generations pass away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  [End of original text.]\n\n\n\nNicholas Vachel Lindsay (1879-1931):\n(Vachel is pronounced Vay-chul, that is, it rhymes with 'Rachel').\n\nVachel Lindsay, of Springfield, Illinois, is best known for his efforts\nto restore the vocal tradition to poetry.  He made a journey on foot\nas far as New Mexico, taking along copies of a pamphlet,\n\"Rhymes to be Traded for Bread\", for the purpose the title suggests.\nHe wrote of this journey in \"Adventures while Preaching the Gospel of\nBeauty\".\n\n\"The Eagle that is Forgotten\" and \"The Congo\" are his best-known poems,\nand appear in his first two volumes of verse, \"General William Booth\nEnters into Heaven\" (1913) and \"The Congo\" (1914).\n\nAs a sidenote, he became close friends with the poet Sara Teasdale\n(well worth reading in her own right--perhaps the better poet),\nand his third volume of verse, \"The Chinese Nightingale\" (1917),\nis dedicated to her.  In turn, she wrote a memorial verse for him\nafter he committed suicide in 1931.",
