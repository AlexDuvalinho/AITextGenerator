Not that her genius is\ndistinctively feminine, though she is in matters historical a\npassionate partisan.  Most of the critics who approve her work agree\nthat in the main she views life with somewhat of the masculine spirit\nof liberality.  She is as much the realist as one can be who is\nsaturated with the romance that is California, her birthplace and her\nhome, if such a true cosmopolite as she can be said to have a home.  In\nall she has written there is abounding life; her grasp of character is\nfirm; her style has a warm, glowing plasticity, frequently a rhythm\nvariously expressive of all the wide range of feeling which a writer\nmust have to make his or her books living things.  She does no less\nwell in the depiction of men than in the portraiture of women.  All\nstand out of their vivid environment distinctly and they are all\npersonalities of power--even, occasionally, of \"that strong power\ncalled weakness.\"  And they all wear something of a glory imparted to\nthem by the sympathy of their creator and interpreter.  High upon any\nroster of our best American writers we must enroll the name of Mrs.\nAtherton.\n\nOf all her books I like best this \"Rezanov,\" though I have not found\nmany to agree with me. It is not so pretentious as others more\nfrequently commended.  It is a simple story, almost one might say an\nincident or an anecdote.  It is not literally sophisticated.  For me\nthat is its unfailing charm. I find in it not a little of the strange,\nprimeval quality that makes me think of \"Aucassin and Nicolette.\"  For\nit is not so much a novel as an historical idyl, not to be read without\na persisting suffusion of sympathy and never to be remembered without a\nrecurring tenderness.  Remembered, did I say?  It is unforgettable.\nThere are few books of American origin that resist so well the passing\nof the years, that take on more steadily the glamour of \"the\nunimaginable touch of time.\"  \"Rezanov\" is a classic, or I miss my\nguess.  This, though it was first published so recently as 1906.\n\nThe story has the merit of being, to some extent historically, and\nwholly artistically, true.  For the matter-of-facts Mrs. Atherton\nprovides a bibliography of her authorities.  Those authorities I have\nnot read, nor should others.  Sufficient unto me is the authority of\nthe novel itself splendidly demonstrated and established in the high\ncourt of the reader's head and heart by the author's visualizing\nveritism.  Not twenty pages have you turned before you know this\nRezanov, privy councilor, grand chamberlain, plenipotentiary of the\nRusso-American company, imperial inspector of the extreme eastern and\nnorthwestern dominions of his imperial majesty Alexander the First,\nemperor of Russia--all this and more, a man.  He comes out of mystery\ninto the softly bright light of California, in strength and shrewdness\nand dignity and personal splendor.  And there is amidst it all a pathos\nupon him.  He commands your affection even while suggesting a doubt\nwhether the man may not be overwhelmed in the diplomat, the intriguer.\nThe year is 1806.  The monstrous apparition of Napoleon has loomed an\nomen of the doom of ancient authority and the shattering of nations in\nEurope. That faithless, incalculable idealist Alexander, plans he knows\nnot what of imperial glory in the Eastern and Western world.  Rezanov\nis his servant, a man of ambition, perhaps in all favor at court,\ndesirous of doing some great service for his master.  He dreams of\ndominion in this sun-soaked land so lazily held in the lax grasp of\nSpain.  He has come from failure.  He had been to Japan with presents\nto the emperor, was received by minor officials with a hospitality that\npoorly concealed the fact that he was virtually a prisoner, and then\ndismissed without admission to the audience he sought with the mikado.\nHe had gone then to bleak, inhospitable Sitka, to find the settlement\nthere in a plague of scurvy and starvation only slightly mitigated by\nvodka.  Down the coast then he sailed to the Spanish settlement for\nfood for the settlement. He comes to that place where in his vision he\nsees arise that city of the future which we know now as San Francisco.\nMasterful man that he is, he feels that here some great thing awaits\nhim.  The Spaniards are wary of him.  They will not trade with him, but\nthey receive him courteously and they are fascinated by his\nself-possessed, well-poised but withal so gracious personality.  The\nlife there at the time is a sort of lotus-eating existence.  It is a\npiece of Spain translated to a more luscious, a lovelier land,\noverlooking beautiful seas and perilous.  Into the dolce far niente\nRezanov enters with some surrender to its softening spell, but with the\ncourtier's prudence.\n\nAnd he meets the girl, Concha Arguello.  He sees her in the setting of\nburning and sweet Castilian roses--a girl who has had the benefit of\neducation, who keeps the graces of old Madrid in this realm beyond sea,\na burgeoning bud of womanhood, daughter of the commandante.  The doom\nof both is upon them at once.  They have drunk the poisoned cup.\nRezanov resists the first approaches of the delightful delirium,\nremembering Russia, his duty, his ambition, the poor starving men of\nthe Sitka factory.  At a party he dances with Concha and they both know\nthat for each there is none other.  So in that setting so wild, so\nstrange, so remote, so lovely for the old world grace that is made\nnative there by this bright, deep, fond girl, the high gods proceed to\nhave their will upon the two.  The little community life pulses around\nthem the faster because they are there.  Their love becomes a motive in\nthe diplomatic drama which has for end, first, the securing of food for\nthose famishing folk at Sitka, and beyond that, possibly the seizing of\nthe region for Russia, lest that new young power of the West, the\nUnited States, preempt the rich domain.  Concha would help the Russian\nto those ends immediate which he reveals to her, and succeeds.  He\ntells her of Russia and his mighty position there.  He would have her\nfor his wife, his helper in the vast imperial affairs at the Russian\ncapitol, his princess in his palace, augmenting his official and\npersonal distinction.  She shares his vision, rising to all the heights\nit unfolds in a splendid future.  Child she is, but she is transformed\ninto a woman by the prospect not of her own pleasure, but of\nparticipation in splendid achievement with this man so keen, so supple,\nyet so firm in high purpose.  And as the prospect opens to her desire\nand his there looms the obstacle.  They cannot marry, for Rezanov is a\nheretic.  And now the passion flames.  This child woman will go with\nhim. Ah, but the church, the king of Spain, will they permit?  And the\nCzar!  Rezanov will see to it that the Czar will clear the way for them\nthrough power exercised at Rome and at Madrid.  Conditioned upon this,\nthe girl's parents consent.\n\nThese lovers prate very little of love.  Their desire runs too deep for\nmere speech.  It is a desire made up of as much spiritual as carnal\nfire.  It is fierce but steady in ecstacy and agony, indistinguishable\nthe one from the other.  Rezanov, man of the great world, it purifies.\nConcha it strengthens and makes indomitable.  They will abide delay.\nThey will endure in faith and hope--the faith and hope both dimmed by\nthe vague and unshakable intuition or premonition that fate has marked\nthem for derision.  Nevertheless, they will endure.\n\nThere is a meeting on a path that overlooks where the white seas strike\ntheir tents.  It is a meeting of little action, of few words.  It is\ntense with the almost inexpressible, but at its end, confronting the\ndoubtful future, realizing that when Rezanov goes he may not return,\nthis girl tells him: \"I will give myself to you forever, how much or\nlittle that may mean here on earth.  Forever!\"  And then that scene in\nthe moonlight amid the scent of the Castilian roses, when Concha, as\nsignal of her trust in her lover, lifts the little wisps of hair that\nconceal her ears and shows them to him--it throbs with passionate\npurity in memory yet.\n\nRezanov sails away to Sitka with provisions, thence to Siberia, and\nthen begins the long ride over endless versts of land, across streams\nin icy flood, in rain and cold and snow towards the capitol and the\nCzar.  Delays, disasters to vehicles and horses and the maddening\nlengthening of time.  From drenchings and freezing comes the fever that\ncalls for more speed.  Krasnoiarsk is reached.  The fever mounts, the\ntraveler must stop and rest and be cared for.  His visions commingle\nhis objective and his memories ... CONCHA! ...  The snowy steppes and\nthe inky rivers....  His servant enters the room in the inn ...  Why\n... \"Where has Jon found Castilian roses in this barren land?\" ... \"and\nhis unconquerably sanguine spirit flared high before a vision of\neternal and unthinkable happiness\" ... Castilian roses!  Concha\nArguello waits among them, immortal, sainted in her purity and\nfidelity, ministering to her poor Indians, her face alight with\nunquenchable memory and with surety of an eventual everlasting tryst.\nThose Castilian roses!  They perfume forever one's memories of this\npair, puissant in faith, in this novel that is a poem and a shrine of\nthat love which lives when death itself is dead.\n\nWILLIAM MARION REEDY\n\n\n\n\nREZANOV\n\n\n\nI\n\nAs the little ship that had three times raced with death sailed past\nthe gray headlands and into the straits of San Francisco on that\nbrilliant April morning of 1806, Rezanov forgot the bitter\nhumiliations, the mental and physical torments, the deprivations and\ndangers of the past three years; forgot those harrowing months in the\nharbor of Nagasaki when the Russian bear had caged his tail in the\npresence of eyes aslant; his dismay at Kamchatka when he had been\nforced to send home another to vindicate his failure, and to remain in\nthe Tsar's incontiguous and barbarous northeastern possessions as\nrepresentative of his Imperial Majesty, and plenipotentiary of the\nCompany his own genius had created; forgot the year of loneliness and\nhardship and peril in whose jaws the bravest was impotent; forgot even\nhis pitiable crew, diseased when he left Sitka, that had filled the\nJuno with their groans and laments; and the bells of youth, long still,\nrang in his soul once more.\n\n\"It is the spring in California,\" he thought, with a sigh that curled\nat the edge.  \"However,\" life had made him philosophical; \"the moments\nof unreasonable happiness are the most enviable no doubt, for there is\nneither gall nor satiety in the reaction. All this is as enchanting\nas--well, as a woman's promise.  What lies beyond?  Illiterate and\nmercenary Spaniards, vicious natives, and boundless ennui, one may\nsafely wager.  But if all California is as beautiful as this, no man\nthat has spent a winter in Sitka should ask for more.\"\n\nIn the extent and variety of his travels Rezanov had seen Nature more\nawesome of feature but never more fair.  On his immediate right as he\nsailed down the straits toward the narrow entrance to be known as the\nGolden Gate, there was little to interest save the surf and the masses\nof outlying rocks where the seals leapt and barked; the shore beyond\nwas sandy and low.  But on his left the last of the northern mountains\nrose straight from the water, the warm red of its deeply indented\ncliffs rich in harmony with the green of slope and height. There was\nnot a tree; the mountains, the promontories, the hills far down on the\nright beyond the sand dunes, looked like stupendous waves of lava that\nhad cooled into every gracious line and fold within the art of\nrelenting Nature; granted ages after, a light coat of verdure to clothe\nthe terrible mystery of birth.  The great bay, as blue and tranquil as\na high mountain lake, as silent as if the planet still slept after the\nagonies of labor, looked to be broken by a number of promontories,\nrising from their points far out in the water to the high back of the\nland; but as the Juno pursued her slanting way down the channel Rezanov\nsaw that the most imposing of these was but the end of a large island,\nand that scattered near were other islands, masses of rock like the\ncastellated heights that rise abruptly from the plains of Italy and\nSpain; far away, narrow straits, with a glittering expanse beyond;\nwhile bounding the whole eastern rim of this splendid sheet of water\nwas a chain of violet hills, with the pale green mist of new grass here\nand there, and purple hollows that might mean groves of trees crouching\nlow against the cold winds of summer; in the soft pale blue haze above\nand beyond, the lofty volcanic peak of a mountain range. Not a human\nbeing, not a boat, not even a herd of cattle was to be seen, and\nRezanov, for a moment forgetting to exult in the length of Russia's\narm, yielded himself to the subtle influence abroad in the air, and\nfelt that he could dream as he had dreamed in a youth when the courts\nof Europe to the boy were as fabulous as El Dorado in the immensity of\nancestral seclusions.\n\n\"It is like the approach to paradise, is it not, Excellency?\" a\ndeferential voice murmured at his elbow.\n\nThe plenipotentiary frowned without turning his head.  Dr. Langsdorff,\nsurgeon and naturalist, had accompanied the Embassy to Japan, and\nalthough Rezanov had never found any man more of a bore and would\nwillingly have seen the last of him at Kamchatka, a skilful dispenser\nof drugs and mender of bones was necessary in his hazardous voyages,\nand he retained him in his suite.  Langsdorff returned his polite\ntolerance with all the hidden resources of his spleen; but his\ncuriosity and scientific enthusiasm would have sustained him through\ngreater trials than the exactions of an autocrat, whom at least he had\nnever ceased to respect in the most trying moments at Nagasaki.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Rezanov.  \"But I wonder you find anything to admire in such\nunportable objects as mountains and water.  I have not seen a living\nthing but gulls and seal, and God knows we had enough of both at Sitka.\"\n\n\"Ah, your excellency, in a land as fertile as this, and caressed by a\nclimate that would coax life from a stone, there must be an infinite\nnumber of aquatic and aerial treasures that will add materially to the\nscientific lore of Europe.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Rezanov, and moved his shoulder in an uncontrollable\ngesture of dismissal.  But the spell of the April morning was broken,\nalthough the learned doctor was not to be the only offender.\n\nThe Golden Gate is but a mile in width and the swift current carried\nthe Juno toward a low promontory from the base of which a shrill cry\nsuddenly ascended.  Rezanov, raising his glass, saw that what he had\ntaken to be a pile of fallen rocks was a fort, and that a group of\nexcited men stood at its gates. Once more the plenipotentiary on a\ndelicate mission, he ordered the two naval officers sailing the ship to\ncome forward, and retired to the dignified isolation of the cabin.\n\nThe high-spirited young officers, who would have raised a gay hurrah at\nthe sight of civilized man had it not been for the awe in which they\nheld their chief, saluted the Spaniards formally, then stood in an\nattitude of extreme respect; the Juno was directly under the guns of\nthe fort.\n\nOne of the Spaniards raised a speaking trumpet and shouted:\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\nNo one on the Juno, save Rezanov, could speak a word of Spanish, but\nthe tone of the query was its own interpreter.  The oldest of the\nlieutenants, through the ship's trumpet, shouted back:\n\n\"The Juno--Sitka--Russian.\"\n\nThe Spanish officer made a peremptory gesture that the ship come to\nanchor in the shelter given by an immense angle of the mainland, of\nwhich the fort's point was the western extreme.  The Russians, as\nbefitted the peaceful nature of their mission, obeyed without delay.\nBefore their resting place, and among the sand hills a mile from the\nbeach, was a quadrangle of buildings some two hundred feet square and\nsurrounded by a wall about fourteen feet high and seven feet thick.\nThis they knew to be the Presidio.  They saw the officers that had\nhailed them gallop over the hill behind the fort to the more ambitious\nenclosure, and, in the square, confer with another group that seemed to\nbe in a corresponding state of excitement.  A few moments later a\ndeputation of officers, accompanied by a priest in the brown habit of\nthe Franciscan order, started on horseback for the beach.  Rezanov\nordered Lieutenant Davidov and Dr. Langsdorff to the shore as his\nrepresentatives.\n\nThe Spaniards wore the undress uniform of black and scarlet in which\nthey had been surprised, but their peaked straw hats were decorated\nwith cords of gold or silver, the tassels hanging low on the broad\nbrim; their high deer-skin boots were gaily embroidered, and bristled\nwith immense silver spurs.  The commanding officer alone had invested\nhimself with a gala serape, a square of red cloth with a bound and\nembroidered slit for the head. Leading the rapid procession, his left\nhand resting significantly on his sword, he was a fine specimen of the\nyoung California grandee, dark and dashing and reckless, lithe of\nfigure, thoroughbred, ardent. His eyes were sparkling at the prospect\nof excitement; not only had the Russians, by their nefarious\nappropriation of the northwestern corner of the continent and a recent\npiratical excursion in pursuit of otter, inspired the Spanish\nGovernment with a profound disapproval and mistrust, but a rumor had\nrun up the coast that made every sea-gull look like the herald of a\nhostile fleet.  This was young Arguello's first taste of command, and\nlife was dull on the northern peninsula; he would have welcomed a\ndeclaration of war.\n\nDavidov and Langsdorff had come to shore in one of the JUNO'S canoes.\nThe conversation was held in Latin between the two men of learning.\n\n\"Who are you and whence come you?\" asked the priest.\n\nLangsdorff, who had been severely drilled by the plenipotentiary as to\ntext, replied with a profound bow: \"We are Russians engaged in\ncompleting the circumnavigation of the globe.  It was our intention to\ngo directly to Monterey and present our official documents, as well as\nour respects, to your illustrious Governor, but owing to contrary winds\nand a resultant scarcity of provisions, we were under the necessity of\nputting into the nearest harbor. The Juno is navigated by Lieutenant\nDavidov and Lieutenant Khovstov, of the Imperial Navy of Russia; by\ngracious permission associated with the Marine of the Russo-American\nCompany.\"  He paused a moment, and then swept out his trump card with a\nmagnificent flourish: \"Our expedition is in command of His Excellency,\nPrivy Counsellor and Grand Chamberlain Baron Rezanov, late Ambassador\nto the Court of Japan, Plenipotentiary of the Russo-American Company,\nImperial Inspector of the extreme eastern and northwestern American\ndominions of His Imperial Majesty, Alexander the First, Emperor of all\nthe Russias, whose representatives in these waters he is.\"\n\nThe Spaniards were properly impressed as the priest translated with the\nglibness of the original; but Arguello, who announced himself as\nCommandante ad interim of the Presidio of San Francisco during the\nabsence of his father at Monterey, nodded sagely several times, and\nthen held a short conference in Spanish with the interpreter.  The\npriest turned to the Russians with a smile as diplomatic as that which\nRezanov had drilled upon the ugly ingenuous countenance of his medicine\nman.\n\n\"Our illustrious Governor, Don Jose Arrillaga, received word from the\ncourt of Spain, now quite two years ago, of the sailing in 1803 from\nKronstadt of the ships Nadeshda and Neva, in command of Captain\nKrusenstern and Captain Lisiansky, the former having on board the\nillustrious Ambassador to Japan, the Privy Counsellor and Chamberlain\nde Rezanov.  It was expected that these ships would touch at more than\none of His Most Holy Catholic Majesty's vast dominions, and all\nviceroys and gobernador proprietarios were alike instructed to receive\nthe exalted representatives of the mighty Emperor of Russia with\nhospitality and respect.  But we cannot understand why his excellency\ncomes to us so late and in so small a ship, rather than in the state\nwith which he sailed from Europe.\"\n\n\"The explanation is simple, my father.  The original ships, from a\nvariety of circumstances, were, upon our arrival at Kamchatka, at the\nconclusion of the embassy to Japan, under the necessity of returning at\nonce to Europe.  His Imperial Majesty, Alexander the First, ordered the\nChamberlain and plenipotentiary, the representative of imperial power\nin the Russo-American possessions, to remove to the Juno for the\npurpose of visiting the Kurile and Aleutian Islands, Kadiak and the\nnorthwestern coast of America.\"  The Tsar had never heard of the Juno,\nbut as Rezanov was practically his august self in these far-away\nwaters, there was enough of truth in this statement to appease the\nconscience of a subordinate.\n\nThe Spaniards were satisfied.  Lieutenant Arguello begged that the\nemissaries would return to the ship and invite the Chamberlain and his\nparty to come at once to the Presidio and do it the honor to partake of\nthe poor hospitality it afforded.  An officer galloped furiously for\nhorses.\n\nA few moments later they were still more deeply impressed by the\nappearance of their distinguished visitor as he stood erect in the boat\nthat brought him to shore.  In full uniform of dark green and gold\nlace, with cocked hat and the splendid order of St. Ann on his breast,\nRezanov was by far the finest specimen of a man the Californians,\nthemselves of ampler build than their European ancestors, had ever\nbeheld.  Of commanding stature and physique, with an air of highest\nbreeding and repose, he looked both a man of the great world and an\nintolerant leader of men.  His long oval face was thin and somewhat\nlined, the mouth heavily moulded and closely set, suggestive of sarcasm\nand humor; the nose long, with arching and flexible nostrils. His eyes,\nseldom widely opened, were light blue, very keen, usually cold.  Like\nmany other men of his position in Europe, he had discarded wig and\nqueue and wore his short fair hair unpowdered.\n\nIt was a singularly imposing but hardly attractive presence, thought\nyoung Arguello, until Rezanov, after stepping on shore and bowing\nformally, suddenly smiled and held out his hand.  Then the\nimpressionable Spaniard \"melted like a woman,\" as he told his sister,\nConcha, and would have embraced the stranger on either cheek had not\nawe lingered to temper his enthusiasm.  But Rezanov never made a\nstauncher friend than Louis Arguello, who vowed to the last of his days\nthat the one man who had fulfilled his ideal of the grand seigneur was\nhe that sailed in from the North on that fateful April morning of 1806.\n\n\n\nII\n\nAs Rezanov, heading the procession with young Arguello, entered the\nwide gates of the Presidio, he received an impression memorably\ndifferent from that which led earlier travelers to describe it\ninclemently as a large square surrounded by mud houses, thatched with\nreeds.  It is true that the walls were of adobe and the roofs of tule,\nnor was there a tree on the sand hills encircling the stronghold. But\nin this early springtime--the summer of the peninsula--the hills showed\npatches of verdure, and all the low white buildings were covered by a\nnetwork of soft dull green and archaic pink.  The Castilian rose, full\nand fluted, and of a chaste and penetrating fragrance, hung singly and\nin clusters on the pillars of the dwellings, on the barracks and\nchapel, from the very roofs; bloomed upon bushes as high as young\ntrees.  The Presidio was as delicately perfumed as a lady's bower, and\nits cannon faced the ever-changing hues of water and island and hill.\n\nAs the party approached, heads of all ages appeared between the vines,\nand there was a low murmur of irrepressible curiosity and delight.\n\n\"We do not see many strangers in this lonely land,\" said Arguello\napologetically.  \"And never before have we had so distinguished a guest\nas your excellency.  It was always a gala day when ever a Boston\nskipper came in with a few bales of goods and a complexion like the\nhides we sold him.  Now, alas! they are no longer permitted to enter\nour ports.  Governor Arrillaga will have none of contraband trade and\nslaying of our otter.  And as for Europeans other than Spaniards, save\nfor an English sea captain now and then, they know naught of our\nexistence.\"\n\nBut Rezanov had not come to California on the impulse of a moment.  He\nreplied suavely: \"There you are mistaken.  Your illustrious father, Don\nJose Mario de Arguello, is well known to us as the most respected,\neminent and influential character in the Californias.  It was my\nintention, after paying a visit of ceremony to his excellency, Governor\nArrillaga, to come to San Francisco for the sole purpose of meeting a\nman whose record has inspired me with the deepest interest.  And we\nhave all heard such wonderful tales of your California, of its beauty,\nits fertility, of the beneficent lives of your missionaries--so\ndifferent from ours--and of the hospitality and elegance of the\nSpaniards, that it has been the objective point of my travels, and I\nhave found it difficult to curb my impatience while attending to\nimperative duties elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Ay! senor!\" exclaimed the young Californian. \"What you say fills me\nwith a pride I cannot express, and I can only regret that the reports\nof our poor habitations should be so sadly exaggerated. Such as our\npossessions are, however, they are yours while you deign to remain in\nour midst.  This is my father's house.  I beg that you will regard it\nas your own.  Burn it if you will!\" he cried with more enthusiasm than\ncommonly enlivened the phrases of hospitality.  \"He will be proud to\nknow that a lifetime of severe attention to duty and of devotion to his\nKing have won him fame abroad as well as at home.  He has risen to his\npresent position from the ranks, but he is of pure Spanish blood, not a\ndrop of Indian; and my mother was a Moraga, of the best blood of\nSpain,\" he added artlessly.  \"As to the beauty and variety of our\ncountry, senor, of course you will visit our opulent south; but--\"\nThey had dismounted at the Commandante's house in the southeast corner\nof the square. Arguello impulsively led Rezanov back to the gates and\npointed to the east.  \"I have crossed those mountains and the mountains\nbeyond, Excellency, and seen fertile and beautiful valleys of a vast\nextent, watered by five rivers and bound far, far away by mountains\ncovered with snow and gigantic trees. The valley beyond the southern\nedge of the bay, where the Missions of Santa Clara and San Jose are, is\nalso rich, but those between the ranges is an empire; and one day when\nthe King sends us more colonists, we shall recompense Spain for all she\nhas lost.\"\n\n\"I congratulate you!\"  Rezanov, indifferent to his host's ancestral\ntree, had lifted an alert ear.  His quick incisive brain was at work.\n\"I should like to stretch my legs over a horse for a week at a time,\nand even to climb your highest mountains.  You may imagine how much\nexercise a man may get on a vessel of two hundred and six tons, and it\nis thirty-two days since I left Sitka.  To look upon a vast expanse of\ngreen--to say nothing of possible sport--after a winter of incessant\nrain and impenetrable forests--what a prospect!  I beg you will take me\noff into the wilderness as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"I promise you the Governor shall not withhold his consent--and there\nare bear and deer--quail, wild duck--your excellency will enjoy that\nbeautiful wild country as I have done.\"  Arguello was enchanted at the\nprospect of fresh adventure in the company of this fascinating\nstranger.  \"But we are once more at our poor abode, senor.  I beg you\nto remember that it is your own.\"\n\nThey ascended the steps of the piazza, suddenly deserted, and it seemed\nto Rezanov that every sense in his being quivered responsively to the\npoignant sweetness of the Castilian roses.  He throbbed with a sudden\nexultant premonition that he stood on the threshold of an historic\nfuture, with a pagan joy in mere existence, a sudden rush of desire for\nthe keen wild happiness of youth.  Such is the elixir of California in\nthe north and the spring.\n\nThey entered a long sala typical of its day and of many to come;\nwhitewashed walls hung with colored prints of the Virgin and saints;\nhorsehair furniture, matting, deep window seats; and a perennial\ncoolness.  The Chamberlain (his court title and the one commonly\nattached to his name) made himself as comfortable as the slippery chair\nwould permit, and Arguello went for his mother.\n\nLangsdorff, who had lingered on the piazza with the priest, entered in\na moment.\n\n\"The good padre tells me that this rose of Castile is the only imported\nflower in California,\" he cried, with enthusiasm, for although not a\nbotanist, there was a bump between his eyes as big as a child's fist\nand he had a nose like the prow of a toy ship.  \"Many cuttings were\nbrought from Spain--\"\n\n\"What difference does it make where it came from?\" interrupted Rezanov\ntestily.  \"Is it not enough that it is beautiful, but it must have a\npin stuck through it like some poor devil of a butterfly?\"\n\n\"Your excellency has also the habit to probe into things he deems\nworthy of his attention,\" retorted the offended scientist; but he was\nobliged to closet his wrath.  An inner door opened and the host\nreappeared with his mother and a fair demonstration of her virtues.\nShe was a very large woman dressed loosely in black, but she carried\nherself with an air of complete, if somewhat sleepy, dignity, and it\nwas evident that her beauty had been great.  Her full face had lost its\ncontours, but time had spared the fine Roman nose and the white skin,\nthat birthright of the high-bred Castilian.  Arguello presented his\nfamily ceremoniously as the guest of honor rose and bowed with formal\ndeference.\n\n\"My mother, Dona Ignacia Arguello, your excellency, who unites with me\nin praying that you will regard our home as yours during your sojourn\nin the north.  My sister, Maria de la Concepcion Marcella Arguello, and\nmy little sisters, Ana Paula and Gertrudis Rudisinda.  My brothers:\nGervasio--soldado distinguido of the San Francisco Company; Santiago, a\ncadet in the same company; Francesco and Toribio, whose presence at the\ntable I beg you will overlook, for when we are so fortunate as to be\nall together, senor, we cannot bear to be separated.  My oldest\nbrother, alas--Ignacio--is studying for holy orders in Mexico, and my\nsister Isabel visits at the Presidio of Santa Barbara.  I beg that you\nwill be seated, Excellency.\"  And he continued the introduction to the\nlesser luminaries, with equal courtesy but fewer periods.\n\nRezanov exchanged a few pleasant words with his smiling hostess before\nshe returned to her distracted maids preparing the dinner; but his eyes\nduring Arguello's declamation had wandered with a singular fidelity to\nthe beautiful face of the eldest daughter of the house.  She had\nresponded with a humorous twinkle in her magnificent black eyes and not\na hint of diffidence.  As she entered the room his brain had flashed\nout the thought: \"Thank heaven for a pretty girl after these three\nabominable years!\"  Possibly his pleasure would have been salted with\npique had he guessed that her thought was the twin of his own.  He was\nthe first man of any world more considerable than the petty court of\nthe viceroy of Mexico that had visited California in her time, and\nexcellent as she found his tall military figure and pale cold face, the\nnovelty of the circumstance fluttered her more.\n\nDona \"Concha\" Arguello was the beauty of California, and although her\nyears were but sixteen her blood was Spanish, and she carried her tall\ndeep figure and fine head with the grace and dignity of an accomplished\nwoman.  She had inherited the white skin and delicate Roman-Spanish\nprofile of the Moragas, but there was an intelligent fire in her eyes,\na sharp accentuation of nostril, and a full mobility of mouth,\nchildish, half-developed as that feature still was, that betrayed a\nstrong cross-current forcing the placid maternal flow into rugged and\nunexplored channels, while assimilating its fine qualities of pride and\nhigh breeding.  Gervasio and Santiago resembled their sister in\ncoloring and profile, but lacked her subtle quality of personality and\ndivine innocence.  Luis was more the mother's son than the\nfather's--saving his olive skin; a grandee, modified by the\nsimplicities of a soldier's life, amiable and upright. Dona Ignacia\nrecognized in Concha the quintessence of the two opposing streams, and\nhad long since ceased to impose upon a girl who had little else but her\nliberties, the conventional restrictions of the Spanish maiden.  Concha\nhad already received many offers of marriage and regarded men as mere\nswingers of incense.  Moreover, her cultivated mind was filled with\nideals and ideas far beyond anything California would yield in her day.\n\nAs Rezanov, upon Dona Ignacia's retreat, walked directly over to her,\nshe smilingly seated herself on a sofa and swept aside her voluminous\nwhite skirts.  She was not sure that she liked him, but in no doubt\nwhatever of her delight at his advent.\n\nHer manners were very simple and artless, as are the manners of most\nwomen whom Nature has gifted with complexity and depth.\n\n\"It is now two years and more that we have been excited over the\nprospect of this visit,\" she said.  \"But if you will tell me what you\nhave been doing all this time, I, at least, will forgive you; for you\nwill never be able to imagine, senor, how I long to hear of the great\nworld.  I stare at the map, then at the few pictures we have.  I know\nmany books of travel by heart; but I am afraid my imagination is a poor\none, for I cannot conjure up great cities filled with people--thousands\nof people!  DIOS DE MI ALMA!  A world where there is something besides\nmountains and water, grain fields, orchards, forests, earthquakes, and\nclimate?  Will you, senor?\"\n\n\"For quite as many hours as you will listen to me.  I propose a\ncompact.  You shall improve my Spanish.  I will impart all I know of\nEurope--and of Asia--if your curiosity reaches that far.\"\n\n\"Even of Japan?\"  There was a wicked spark in her eye.\n\n\"I see you already have some knowledge of the cause of my delay.\"  His\nvoice was even, but a wound smarted.  \"It is quite true, senorita, that\nthe first embassy to Japan, from which we hoped so much, was a\nhumiliating failure, and that I was played with for six months by a\npeople whom we had regarded as a nation of monkeys.  When my health\nbegan to suffer from the long confinement on shipboard--we had\npreviously been fourteen months at sea--and I asked to be permitted to\nlive on shore while my claims to an audience were under consideration,\nI was removed with my suite to a cage on a strip of land nearly\nsurrounded with water, where I had less liberty and exercise than on\nshipboard.  Finally, I had a ridiculous interview with a 'great man,'\nin which I accomplished nothing but the preservation of what personal\ndignity a man may while sitting on his heels; the superb presents of\nthe Tsar were returned to me, and I was politely told to leave.  Japan\nwanted neither the friendship of Russia nor her gimcracks.  That,\nsenorita, is the history of the first Russian Embassy--for the\ntentative visit of Adam Lanxmann, twelve years before, can be dignified\nby no such title--to Oriental waters. It is to be hoped that Count\nGolofkin, who was to undertake a similar mission to China, has met with\na better fate.\"\n\nUnderneath the polished armour of a man who was a courtier when he\nchose and the dominating spirit always, he was hot and quick of temper.\nHis light cold eyes glowed with resentment at the dancing lights in\nhers, as he cynically gave her a bald abstract of the unfortunate\nmission.  He reflected that commonly he would have fitted a different\nmask to the ugly skull of fact, but this young barbarian, as he chose\nto regard her, excited the elemental truth in him, defying him to\nappear at his worst.  He was astonished to see her eyes suddenly soften\nand her mouth tremble.\n\n\"It must have been a hateful experience--hateful!\"  Her voice,\nbeginning on its usual low soft note, rose to a hoarse pitch of\nindignation.  \"I should have killed somebody!  To be a man, and strong,\nand caressed all one's life by fortune--and to be as helpless as an\nIndian!  Madre de dios!\"\n\n\"I shall take my revenge,\" said Rezanov shortly; but the wound closed,\nand once more he became aware of the poignant sweetness of Castilian\nroses. Concha wore one in her soft dusky hair, and another where the\nlittle round jacket of white linen, gaily embroidered with pink, met on\nher bosom. But if sentiment tempted him he was quickly poised by her\nnext remarks.  She uttered them in a low tone, although the animated\nconversation of the rest of the party would have permitted the two on\nthe sofa to exchange the vows of love unheard.\n\n\"But what a practice for your diplomatic talents, Excellency!  Poor\nCalifornia!  At least let me be the first to hear what you have come\nfor?\"  Her voice dropped to a soft cooing note, although her eyes\ntwinkled.  \"For the love of God, senor!  I am so bored in this life on\nthe edge of the world!  To see the seams and ravelings of a diplomatic\nintrigue!  I have read and heard of many, but never had I hoped to link\nmy finger in anything subtler than a quarrel between priest and\nGovernor, or the jealousy of Los Angeles for Monterey.  I even will\nhelp you--if you mean no harm to my father or my country.  And I am not\na friend to scorn, senor, for my blessed father is as wax in my hands,\nthe dear old Governor adores me, and even Padre Abella, who thinks\nhimself a great diplomat, and is watching us out of the corner of his\neye, while I make him believe you pay me so many compliments my poor\nlittle head turns round--Bueno senor!\"  As she raised her voice she\nplucked the rose from her dress and tossed it to Rezanov.  Then she\nlifted her chin and pouted her childish lips at the ironical smile of\nthe priest.\n\nRezanov was close to betraying his surprise; but as he cherished a\nbelief that the souls of all pretty women went to school to the devil\nbefore entering upon earthly enterprise, he wondered that he had been\nopen to the illusion of complete ingenuousness in a descendant of one\nof the oldest and subtlest civilizations of earth.  Within that\nluminous shell of youth there were, no doubt, whispering memories of\nmen and women steeped in court intrigue from birth, of triumphant\nbeauties that had lived for love and their power over the passions of\nmen as ardent as himself.  It was quite possible that she might be as\nuseful as she desired.  But his impulses were in leash.  He merely\nlooked and murmured his admiration.\n\n\"Better ask, what chance have I, a defenceless man, who has not seen a\ncharming woman for three years, against such practised art?  If you can\nhoodwink a Spanish priest, and manipulate a Governor who has won the\nconfidence of the most suspicious court in Europe, what fortune for a\nbarbarian of the north?  Less than with Japan, I should think.\"\n\nHe divested the rose of its thorns and many tight little buds, and\nthrust the stem underneath the star of St. Ann.  She lifted her chin\nagain and tossed her head.\n\n\"You do not trust me, but you will.  I fancy it will be before\nlong--for it is quite true that the Californians are not so easily\noutwitted.  And--even did I not help you, I would not--I vow,\nsenor!--betray you.  Is it true that Russia is at war with Spain?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Have you not heard?  It was for that we were all so excited this\nmorning.  We thought your ship might be the first of a fleet.\"\n\n\"I have heard no such rumor, and you may dismiss it.  Russia is too\nmuch occupied with Napoleon Bonaparte, who has had himself crowned\nEmperor, and by this time is probably at war with half Europe--\"\n\nShe interrupted him with flashing eye.  The pink in her cheeks had\nturned red.  The thin nostrils of her pretty Roman nose fluttered like\npaper.  \"Ah!\" she exclaimed, again with that note of hoarseness in her\nvoice.  \"There is a great man, not a mere king on a throne his\nancestors made for him.  Papa hates him because he has seized a throne.\nAY YI! DIOS, but you should hear the words fly when we go to war\ntogether.  But I do not care that\"--she snapped her firm white\nfingers--\"for all the Bourbons that are in Europe.  Bonaparte!  Do you\nknow him?  Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"I have seen him insult poor Markov, our ambassador to France, when I\ncan assure you that he looked like neither a demi-god nor a gentleman.\nWhen you have improved my Spanish I will tell you many anecdotes of\nhim.  Meanwhile, am I to assume that you reserve your admiration for\nthe man that carves his career in defiance of the rusty old machinery?\"\n\n\"I do!  I do!  My father was of the people, a poor boy.  He has risen\nto be the most powerful of all Californians, although the King he\nadores never makes him Gobernador Proprietario.  I tell him he should\nbe the first to recognize the genius and the ambitions of a Bonaparte.\nThe mere thought horrifies him.  But in me that same strong plebeian\nblood makes another cry, and if my father had but enough men at his\nback, and the will to make himself King of the Californias--Madre de\nDios! how I should help him!\"\n\n\"At least I know her better than she knows me,\" thought Rezanov, as the\ninner door was thrown open and another bare room with a long table\nladen with savory food on a superb silver service was revealed.  \"And\nif I know anything of women, I can trust her--for as long as she may be\nnecessary, at all events.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\"Santiago!\" whispered Concha.  \"Do not go down to the ship.  Take me\nfor a walk.  I have much to say.\"\n\nSantiago, who had not been asked to form one of the escort upon the\nreturn of the Russians to the Juno for the night, felt injured and\nsulky and deigned no reply.\n\n\"If you do not, I'll not braid your hair to-morrow,\" said his sister,\ngiving his arm a little shake; and he succumbed.  The luxuriant tresses\nof the male Arguellos were combed and braided and tied with a ribbon\nevery morning by the women of the family, and Concha's fingers were the\ngentlest and deftest.  And Concha and Santiago were more intimate than\neven the rest of that united family.  They had studied and read\ntogether, were equally dissatisfied with their narrow existence,\nambitious for a wider experience.  Santiago consoled himself with cards\nand training roosters for battle, and otherwise as a man may.  He was\nbut fifteen, this haughty, severe-looking young hidalgo, but while in\nsome respects many years older than his sister, in others he was\nyounger, for he possessed none of her illuminating instinct.\n\nShe led him through a postern gate, round the first of the dunes, and\nthey were alone in a waste of sand.  She demanded abruptly:\n\n\"What do you think of our illustrious visitor?\"\n\n\"I like him.  He would wring your neck if you got in his way, but has a\nkind heart for those that call him master.  I like that sort of a man.\nI wish he would take me away with him.\"\n\n\"He shall--one of these days.  Santiago mio, let me whisper--\"  She\npulled his ear down to her lips.  \"He will marry me.  I feel it.  I\nknow it. He has talked to me the whole day.  He has told me grave\nsecrets.  Not even to you would I reveal them.  So many have loved\nme--why should not he?  I shall live in St. Petersburg, and see all\nEurope!--thousands of people--Dios mio!  Dios mio!\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"  Santiago, still unamiable, responded to this confidence with\na sneer.  \"You aspire very high for a little girl of the wilderness,\nwithout fortune, and only half a coat-of-arms, so to speak.  Do you\nknow that this Rezanov--Dr. Langsdorff has told us all about him--is a\ngreat noble, one of the ten barons of Russia, and a Chamberlain in\naccordance with a decree of Peter the Great that court titles should be\nbestowed as a reward for distinguished services alone?  He got a\nfortune in his youth by marriage with a daughter of Shelikov--that\nSiberian who founded the Russian colonies in America.  The wife died\nalmost immediately, but the Baron's influence remained with\nShelikov--for his influence at court was even greater--and after the\nolder man's death, with his mother-in-law, who is uncommonly clever.\nShelikov's schemes were but little sketches beside Rezanov's, who from\nmerely a courtier and a gay blood about town developed into a great man\nof business, with an ambition to correspond.  It was he who got the\nImperial ukase that gave the Russian-American Company its power to\nsqueeze all the other fur hunters and traders out of the northeast, and\nmade Rezanov and everybody belonging to it so rich your head would swim\nif I told you the number of doubloons they spend in a year.  Nobody has\never been so clever at managing those old beasts of autocrats as he.\nThey think him merely the accomplished courtier, a brilliant\ndilettante, a condescending patron of art and letters, a devotee of\npleasure, and all the time he is pulling their befuddled old brains\nabout to suit himself. The Tsar Paul was a lunatic and they murdered\nhim, but meanwhile he signed the ukase.  The Tsar Alexander, who is not\nso bad nor so silly as the others, thinks there is no man so clever as\nRezanov, who addresses him personally when sending home his reports.\nDo you know what all that means? Your plenipotentiary is not only a\nChamberlain at court, a Privy Councillor, and the Tsar himself on this\nside of the world, but when his inspections and reforms are concluded,\nand he is one of the wealthiest men in Russia, he will return to St.\nPetersburg and become so high and mighty that a princess would snap at\nhim.  And you aspire!  I never heard such nonsense.\"\n\n\"His excellency told me much of this,\" replied Concha imperturbably.\n\"And I am sure that he cares nothing for princesses and will marry whom\nhe most admires.  He would not say, but I know he cared nothing for\nthat poor little wife, dead so long ago.  It was a mariage de\nconvenance, such as all the great world is accustomed to.  He will love\nme more than all the fine ladies he has ever seen.  I feel it.  I know\nit!  And I am quite happy.\"\n\n\"Do you love him?\" asked Santiago, looking curiously at his sister's\nflushed and glowing face. It seemed to him that she had never looked so\nyoung.  \"Many have loved you.  I had begun to think you had no heart\nfor men, no wish for anything but admiration.  And now you give your\nheart in a day to this Russian--who must be nearly forty--unasked.\"\n\n\"I have not thought of my heart at all.  But I could love him, of\ncourse.  He is so handsome, so kind, so grand, so gay!  But love is for\nmen and wives--has not my mother said so?  Now I think only of St.\nPetersburg! of Paris! of London! of the beautiful gowns and jewels I\nshall wear at court--a red velvet train as long as a queen's, and all\nembroidered with gold, a white veil spangled with gold, a head-dress a\nfoot high studded with jewels, ropes of diamonds and pearls--I made him\ntell me how the great ladies dressed.  Ah! there is the pleasure of\nbeing a girl--to think and dream of all those beautiful things, not of\nwhen the wife must live always for the husband and children.  That\ncomes soon enough.  And why should I not have all!--there is so little\nin life for the girl.  It seems to me now that I have had nothing.\nWhen he asks me to marry him he will tell me of the fine things I shall\nhave and the great sights I shall witness--the ceremonies at court, the\nwinter streets--with snow--snow, Santiago!--where the great nobles\ndrive four horses through the drifts like little hills, and are wrapped\nin furs like bears!  The grand military parades--how I shall laugh when\nI think of our poor little Presidios with their dozen officers\nstrutting about--\"  She stopped abruptly and bursting wildly into tears\nflung herself into her brother's arms.  \"But I never could leave you!\nAnd my father! my mother! all! all!  Ay, Dios de mi alma! what an\ningrate I am!  I should die of homesickness!  My Santiago!  My\nSantiago!\"\n\nSantiago patted her philosophically.  \"You are not going to-morrow,\" he\nreminded her.  \"Don't cross your bridges until you come to them.  That\nis a good proverb for maids and men.  You might take us all with you,\nor spend every third year or so in California.  No doubt you would need\nthe rest. And meanwhile remember that the high and mighty Chamberlain\nhas not yet asked for the honor of an alliance with the house of\nArguello, and that your brother will match his best fighting cock\nagainst your new white lace mantilla from Mexico, that he is not\nmeditating any project so detrimental to his fortunes.  Console\nyourself with the reflection that if he were, our father and the\npriests, and the Governor himself, would die of apoplexy.  He is a\nheretic--a member of the Greek Church!  Hast thou lost thy reason,\nConchita?  Dry your eyes and come home to sleep, and let us hear no\nmore of marriage with a man who is not only a barbarian of the north\nand a heretic, but so proud he does not think a Californian good enough\nto wash his decks.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nIt was long before Rezanov slept that night.  The usual chill had come\nin from the Pacific as the sun went down, and the distinguished visitor\nhad intimated to his hosts that he should like to exercise on shore\nuntil ready for his detested quarters; but Arguello dared not, in the\nabsence of his father, invite the foreigner even to sleep in the house\nso lavishly offered in the morning; although he had sent such an\nabundance of provisions to the ship that the poor sailors were deep in\nsleep, gorged like boa-constrictors; and he could safely promise that\nwhile the Juno remained in port her larder should never be empty.  He\nshared the evening bowl of punch in the cabin, then went his way\nlamenting that he could not take his new friends with him.\n\nRezanov paced the little deck of the Juno to keep his blood in stir.\nThere was no moon.  The islands and promontories on the great sheet of\nwater were black save for the occasional glow of an Indian camp-fire.\nThere was not a sound but the lapping of the waves, the roar of distant\nbreakers.  The great silver stars and the little green stars looked\ndown upon a solitude that was almost primeval, yet mysteriously\ndisturbed by the restless currents in the brain of a man who had little\nin common with primal forces.\n\nRezanov was uneasy on more scores than one. He was annoyed and\nmortified at the discovery--made over the punch bowl--that the girl he\nhad taken to be twenty was but sixteen.  It was by no means his first\nexperience of the quick maturity of southern women--but sixteen!  He\nhad never wasted a moment on a chit before, and although he was a man\nof imagination, and notwithstanding her intelligence and dignity, he\ncould not reconcile properties so conflicting with any sort of feminine\nideal.\n\nAnd the pressing half of his mission he had confided to her!  No man\nknew better than he the value of a tactful and witty woman in the\npolitical dilemmas of life; more than one had given him devoted\nservice, nor ever yet had he made a mistake. After several hours spent\nin the society of this clever, politic, dissatisfied girl he had come\nto the conclusion that he could trust her, and had told her of the\nlamentable condition of the creatures in the employ of the\nRussian-American Company; of their chronic state of semi-starvation, of\nthe scurvy that made them apathetic of brain and body, and eventually\nwould exterminate them unless he could establish reciprocal trade\nrelations with California and obtain regular supplies of farinaceous\nfood; acknowledged that he had brought a cargo of Russian and Boston\ngoods necessary to the well-being of the Missions and Presidios, and\nthat he would not return to the wretched people of Sitka, at least,\nwithout a generous exchange of breadstuffs, dried meats, peas, beans,\nbarley and tallow.  Not only had he no longer the courage to witness\ntheir misery, but his fortune and his career were at stake.  His entire\ncapital was invested in the Company he had founded, and he had failed\nin his embassy to Japan--to the keen mortification of the Tsar and the\njubilation of his enemies.  If he left the Emperor's northeastern\ndominions unreclaimed and failed to rescue the Company from its\nprecarious condition, he hardly should care to return to St. Petersburg.\n\nDona Concha had listened to this eloquent harangue--they sat alone at\none end of the long sala while Luis at the other toiled over letters to\nthe Governor and his father advising them of the formidable honor of\nthe Russian's visit--in exactly the temper he would have chosen.  Her\nfine eyes had melted and run over at the moving tale of the sufferings\nof the servants of the Company--until his own had softened in response\nand he had impulsively kissed her hand; they had dilated and flashed as\nhe spoke of his personal apprehensions; and when he had given her a\npractical explanation of his reasons for coming to California she had\ngiven him advice as practical in return.\n\nHe must withhold from her father and the Governor the fact of his\npressing need; they were high officials with an inflexible sense of\nduty, and did all they could to enforce the law against trading with\nforeigners.  He was to maintain the fiction of belting the globe, but\nadmit that he had indulged in a dream of commercial relations--for a\nbenefit strictly mutual--between neighbors as close as the Spanish and\nRussians in America.  This would interest them--what would not, on the\nedge of the world?--and they would agree to lay the matter, reinforced\nby a strong personal plea, before the Viceroy of Mexico; who in turn\nwould send it to the Cabinet and King at Madrid.  Meanwhile, he was to\nconfide in the priests at the Mission.  Not only would their sympathies\nbe enlisted, but they did much trading under the very nose of the\ngovernment.  Not for personal gain--they were vowed to a life of\npoverty; but for their Indian converts; and as there were twelve\nhundred at the Mission of San Francisco, they would wink at many things\ncondemnable in the abstract.  He had engaged to visit them on the\nmorrow, and he must take presents to tempt their impersonal cupidity,\nand invite them to inspect the rest of his wares--which the Governor\nwould be informed his Excellency had been forced to buy with the Juno\nfrom the Yankee skipper, D'Wolf, and would rid himself of did\nopportunity offer.\n\nRezanov had never received sounder advice, and had promptly accepted\nit.  Now, as he reflected that it had been given by a girl of sixteen,\nhe was divided between admiration of her precocity and fear lest she\nprove to be too young to keep a secret.  Moreover, there were other\nconsiderations.\n\nRezanov, although in his earlier years he had so far sacrificed his\ninterests and played into the hands of his enemies, in avoiding the too\nembarrassing partiality of Catherine the Great, had nevertheless held a\nhigh place at court by right of birth, and been a man of the world\nalways; rarely absent from St. Petersburg during the last and least\nsusceptible part of the imperial courtesan's life, the brief reign of\nPaul, and the two years between the accession of Alexander and the\nsailing of the Nadeshda.  Moreover, there was hardly another court of\nimportance in Europe with which he was not familiar, and few men had\nhad a more complete experience of life. And the life of a courtier, a\ndiplomat, a traveller, noble, wealthy, agreeable to women by divine\nright, with active enemies and a horde of flatterers, in daily contact\nwith the meaner and more disingenuous corners of human nature, is not\nconducive to a broad optimism and a sweet and immutable Christianity.\nRezanov inevitably was more or less cynical and blase', and too long\nversed in the ways of courts and courtiers to retain more than a\nwhimsical tolerance of the naked truth and an appreciation of its\nexcellence as a diplomatic manoeuvre. Nevertheless, he was by nature\ntoo impetuous ever to become under any provocation a dishonest man, and\ntoo normally a gentleman to deviate from a certain personal code of\nhonor.  He might come to California with fair words and a very definite\nintention of annexing it to Russia at the first opportunity, but he was\nincapable of abusing the hospitality of the Arguellos by making love to\ntheir sixteen-year-old daughter.  Had she been of the years he had\nassumed, he would have had less scruple in embarking upon a flirtation,\nboth for the pastime and the use he might make of her.  A Spanish\nbeauty of twenty, still unmarried, would be more than his match.  But a\nchild, however precocious, inevitably would fall in love with the first\nuncommon stranger she met; and Rezanov, less vain than most men of his\nkind, and with a fundamental humanity that was the chief cause in his\nefforts to improve the condition of his wretched promuschleniki, had no\ntaste for the role of heart-breaker.\n\nBut the girl had proved her timeliness; would, if trustworthy, be of\nfurther use in inclining her father and the Governor toward such of his\ndesigns as he had any intentions of revealing; and, weighing carefully\nhis conversations with her, he was disposed to believe that she would\nscreen and abet him through vanity and love of intrigue.  After the\ndinner, in the seclusion of the sala, he had taken pains to explore for\nthe causes of her mental maturity.  Concha had told him of Don Jose\nArguello's ambition that his children in their youth should have the\neducation he had been forced to acquire in his manhood; he had taught\nthem himself, and notwithstanding his piety and the disapproval of the\npriests, had permitted them to read the histories, travels, and\nbiographies he received once a year from the City of Mexico.  Rezanov\nhad met Madame de Stael and other bas bleus, and given them no more of\nhis society than politeness demanded, but although astonished at the\namount of information this young girl had assimilated, he found nothing\nin her manner of wearing her intellectual crown to offend his\nfastidious taste.  She was wholly artless in her love of books and of\ndiscussing them; and nothing in their contents had disturbed the\nsweetest innocence he had ever met.  Of the little arts of coquetry she\nwas mistress by inheritance and much provocation, but her unawakened\ninner life breathed the simplicity and purity of the elemental roses\nthat hovered about her in his thoughts.  Her very unsusceptibility made\nthe game more dangerous; if it piqued him--and he aspired to be no more\nthan human--he either should have to marry her, or nurse a sore spot in\nhis conscience for the rest of his life; and for neither alternative\nhad he the least relish.\n\nHe dismissed the subject at last with an impatient shrug.  Perhaps he\nwas a conceited ass, as his English friends would say; perhaps the\nGovernor would be more amenable than she had represented.  No man could\nforecast events.  It was enough to be forearmed.\n\nBut his thoughts swung to a theme as little disburdening.  His needs,\nas he had confided to Concha, were very pressing.  The dry or frozen\nfish, the sea dogs, the fat of whales, upon which the employees of the\nCompany were forced to subsist in the least hospitable of climes, had\nravaged them with scorbutic diseases until their numbers were so\nreduced by death and desertion that there was danger of depopulation\nand the consequent bankruptcy of the Company.  Since June of the\npreceding year until his departure from New Archangel in the previous\nmonth, he had been actively engaged in inspection of the Company's\nholdings from Kamchatka to Sitka: reforming abuses, establishing\nschools and libraries, conceiving measures to protect the fur-bearing\nanimals from reckless slaughter both by the promuschleniki and\nmarauding foreigners; punishing and banishing the worst offenders\nagainst the Company's laws; encouraging the faithful, and sharing\nhardships with them that sent memories of former luxuries and pleasures\nscurrying off to the realms of fantasy.  But his rule would be\nincomplete and his efforts end in failure if the miserable Russians and\nnatives in the employ of the Company were not vitalized by proper food\nand cheered with the hope of its permanence.\n\nIn Santiago's story of the Russian visitor's achievements and status\nthere was the common mingling of truth and fiction the exalted never\nfail to inspire.  Rezanov, although he had accomplished great ends\nagainst greater odds, was too little of a courtier at heart ever to\nhave been a prime favorite in St. Petersburg until the accession of a\nruler with whom he had something in common.  A dissolute woman and a\ncrack-brained despot were the last to appreciate an original and\nindependent mind, and the seclusion of Alexander had been so complete\nduring the lifetime of his father that Rezanov barely had known him by\nsight.  But the Tsarovitz, enthusiastic for reform and a passionate\nadmirer of enterprise, knew of Rezanov, and no sooner did he mount his\ngory throne than he confirmed the Chamberlain in his enterprise, and\ntwo years later made him a Privy Counsellor, invested him with the\norder of St. Ann, and chose him for the critical embassy to the verdant\nrealm with the blind and gateless walls.\n\nRezanov had conquered so far in life even less by address than by the\ndemonstration of abilities very singular in a man of his birth and\neducation.  When he met Shelikov, during the Siberian merchant-trader's\nvisit to St. Petersburg in 1788, he was a young man with little\ninterest in life outside of its pleasures, and a patrimony that enabled\nhim to command them to no great extent and barely to maintain the\ndignity of his rank.  Shelikov's plan to obtain a monopoly of the fur\ntrade in the islands and territories added by his Company to Russia,\npossibly throughout the entire possession, thus preventing the\ndestruction of sables, seals, otters, and foxes by small traders and\nforeigners, interested him at once; or possibly he was merely\nfascinated at first by the shrewd and dauntless representative of a\nclass with which he had never before come in contact.  The accidental\nacquaintance ripened into intimacy, Rezanov became a partner in the\nShelikov-Golikov Company, and married the daughter of his new friend.\nAfter the death of his father-in-law, in 1795, his ambitions and\nbusiness abilities, now fully awake, prompted him to obtain for himself\nand his partners rights analogous to those granted by England to the\nEast India Company.  Shelikov had won little more than half the power\nand privileges he had solicited of Catherine, although he had\namalgamated the two leading companies, drawn in several others, and\nbuilt ships and factories and forts to protect them.  And if the\nregnant merchants made large fortunes, the enterprise in general\nsuffered from the rivalries between the various companies, and above\nall from lack of imperial support.\n\nRezanov, his plans made, brought to bear all the considerable influence\nhe was able to command, called upon all his resources of brain and\naddress, and brought Catherine to the point of consenting to sign the\ncharter he needed.  Before it was ready for the imperial signature she\ndied.  Rezanov was forced to begin again with her ill-balanced and\nintractable son.  Natalie Shelikov, his famous mother-in-law, the old\nshareholders of the Company, and the many new ones that had subscribed\nto Rezanov's ambitious project, gave themselves up to despair. For a\ntime the outlook was dark.  The personal enemies of Rezanov and the\nbitter and persistent opponents of the companies threw themselves\neagerly into the scale with tales of brutality of the merchants and the\nthreatened extirpation of the fur-bearing animals.  Paul announced his\nattention to abolish all the companies and close the colonies to\ntraders big and little.\n\nBut the enemy had a very subtle antagonist in Rezanov.  Apparently\ndismissing the subject, he applied himself to gaining a personal\nascendancy over the erratic but impressionable Tsar.  No one in the\nopposing camp could compare with him in that fine balance of charm and\nbrain which was his peculiar gift, or in the adroit manipulation of a\nmind propelled mainly by vanity.  He studied Paul's moods and\ncharacter, discovered that after some senseless act of oppression he\nsuffered from a corresponding remorse, and was susceptible to any plan\nthat would increase his power and add lustre to his name.  The\ncommercial and historic advantages of prosperous northeastern\npossessions were artfully instilled.  At the opportune moment Rezanov\nlaid before him a scheme, mature in every detail, for a great company\nthat would add to the wealth of Russia, and convince Europe of the\nsound commercial sense and immortal wisdom of its sovereign.  Without\nmore ado he obtained his charter.\n\nThis momentous instrument granted to the \"Russian-American Company\nunder our Highest Protection,\" \"full privileges, for a period of twenty\nyears on the coast of northwestern America, beginning from latitude 55\ndegrees north, and including the chain of islands extending from\nKamchatka northward, and southward to Japan; the exclusive right to all\nenterprises, whether hunting, trading, or building, and to new\ndiscoveries; with strict prohibition from profiting from any of these\npursuits, not only to all parties who might engage in them on their own\nresponsibility, but also to those who formerly had ships and\nestablishments there, except those who have united with the new\nCompany.\"  All private traders who refused to join the Company were to\nbe allowed to sell their property and depart in peace.\n\nThus was formed the first of the Trusts in America; and the United\nStates never has had so formidable a menace to her territorial\ngreatness as this Russian nobleman who paced that night the wretched\ndeck of the little ship he had bought from one of her skippers.\nPerturbed in mind at his recent failures and immediate prospects, he\nwas no less determined to take California from the Spaniards either by\nabsorption or force.\n\nOn his way from New Archangel to San Francisco he had met with his\nsecond failure since leaving St. Petersburg.  It was his intention to\nmove the Sitkan colony down to the mouth of the Columbia River; not\nonly pressed by the need of a more beneficent soil, but as a first\ninsidious advance upon San Francisco Bay.  Upon this trip it would be\nenough to make a survey of the ground and bury a copper plate\ninscribed: \"Possession of the Russian Empire.\"  The Juno had\nencountered terrific storms.  After three desperate attempts to reach\nthe mouth of the river, Rezanov had been forced to relinquish the\nenterprise for the moment and hasten with his diseased and almost\nuseless crew to the nearest port.  It was true that the attempt could\nbe made again later, but Rezanov, sanguine of temperament, was\ncorrespondingly depressed by failure and disposed to regard it as an\nill-omen.\n\nAn ambassador inspired by heaven could have accomplished no more with\nthe Japanese at that mediaeval stage of their development than he had\ndone, and the most indomitable of men cannot yet control the winds of\nheaven; but sovereigns are rarely governed by logic, and frequently by\nthe favorite at hand.  The privilege of writing personally to the Tsar,\nin his case, meant more and less than appeared on the surface.  It was\na measure to keep the reports of the Company out of the hands of the\nAdmiralty College, its bitterest enemy, and always jealous of the Civil\nService.  Nevertheless, Rezanov knew that he had no immediate reason to\napprehend the loss of Alexander's friendship and esteem; and if he\nplaced the Company, in which all the imperial family had bought shares,\non a sounder basis than ever before, and doubled its earnings by\ninsuring the health of its employees, he would meet, when in St.\nPetersburg again, with practically no opposition to his highest\nambitions.  These ambitions he deliberately kept in a fluid state for\nthe present. Whether he should aspire to great authority in the\ngovernment, or choose to rule with the absolute powers of the Tsar\nhimself these already vast possessions on the Pacific--to be extended\nindefinitely--would be decided by events.  All his inherited and\ncultivated instincts yearned for the brilliant and complex\ncivilizations of Europe, but the new world had taken a firm hold upon\nhis humaner and appealed more insidiously to his despotic.  Moreover,\nEurope, torn up by that human earthquake, Napoleon Bonaparte, must lose\nthe greater half of its sweetness and savor.  All that, however, could\nbe determined upon his return to St. Petersburg in the autumn.\n\nBut meanwhile he must succeed with these Californians, or they might\nprove, toy soldiers as they were, more perilous to his fortunes than\nenemies at court.  He could not afford another failure; and news of\nthis attempt and an exposition of all that depended upon it were\nalready on the road to the capital of Russia.\n\nHe had known, of course, of the law that forbade the Spanish colonies\nto trade with foreign ships, but he had relied partly upon the use he\ncould make of the orders given by the Spanish King at the request of\nthe Tsar regarding the expedition under Krusenstern, partly upon his\nown wit and address. But although the royal order had insured him\nimmediate hospitality and saved him many wearisome formalities, he had\nalready discovered that the Spanish on the far rim of their empire had\nlost nothing of their connate suspicion.  Rather, their isolation made\nthem the more wary.  Although they little appreciated the richness and\nvariousness of California's soil, and not at all this wonderful bay\nthat would accommodate the combined navies of the world, pocketing\nseveral, the pious zeal of the clergy in behalf of the Indians, and the\ngeneral policy of Spain to hold all of the western hemisphere that\ndisintegrating forces would permit, made her as tenacious of this vast\nterritory she had so sparsely populated as had she been aware that its\nfoundations were of gold, conceived that its climate and soil were a\nmore enduring source of wealth than ever she would command again.  If\nRezanov was not gifted with the prospector's sense for ores--although\nhe had taken note of Arguello's casual reference to a vein of silver\nand lead in the Monterey hills--no man ever more thoroughly appreciated\nthe visible resources of California than he.  Baranhov, chief-manager\nof the Company, had talked with American and British skippers for\ntwenty years, and every item he had accumulated Rezanov had extracted.\nTo-day he had drawn further information from Concha and her brothers;\nand their artless descriptions as well as this incomparable bay had\nfilled him with enthusiasm.  What a gift to Russia!  What an\nachievement to his immortal credit!  The fog rolled in from the Pacific\nin great white waves and stealthily enfolded him, obliterated the sea\nand the land.  But he did not see it.  Apprehension left him.  Once\nmore he fell to dreaming. In the course of a few years the Company\nwould attract a large population to the mouth of the Columbia River, be\nstrong enough to make use of any favorable turn in European politics\nand sweep down upon California.  The geographical position of Mexico,\nthe arid and desolate, herbless and waterless wastes intervening, would\nprohibit her sending any considerable assistance overland; and, all\npowerful at court by that time, he would take care that the Russian\nnavy inspired Spain with a distaste for remote Pacific waters.  He had\nlong since recovered from the disappointment induced by the orders\ncompelling him to remain in the colonies.  The great Company he had\nheretofore regarded merely as a source of income and a means of\nadvancing his ambitions, he now loved as his child. Even during the\nmarches over frozen swamps and mountains, during the terrible winter in\nSitka when he had become familiar with illness and even with hunger,\nhis ardor had grown, as well as his determination to force Russia into\nthe front rank of Commercial Europe.  The United States he barely\nconsidered.  He respected the new country for the independent spirit\nand military genius that had routed so powerful a nation as Great\nBritain, but he thought of her only as a new and tentative civilization\non the far shores of the Atlantic.  After some experience of travel in\nSiberia, and knowing the immensity and primeval conditions of\nnorth-western America, he did not think it probable that the little\ncluster of states, barely able to walk alone, would indulge in dreams\nof expansion for many years to come.  He had heard of the projected\nexpedition of Lewis and Clarke to the mouth of the Columbia,\nbut--perhaps he was too Russian--he did not take any adventure\nseriously that had not a mighty nation at its back.  And as it was\nalmost the half of a century from that night before the American flag\nflew over the Custom House of Monterey, there is reason to believe that\nRussian aggression under the leadership of so energetic and resourceful\na spirit as Nicolai Petrovich de Rezanov was in a fair way to make\nhistory first in the New Albion of Drake and the California of the\nincompetent Spaniard.\n\n\n\nV\n\nThe Russians were to call at the house of the Commandante on their way\nto the Mission, and Concha herself made the chocolate with which they\nwere to be detained for another hour.  It was another sparkling\nmorning, one of the few that came between winter and summer, summer and\nwinter, and made even this bleak peninsula a land of enchantment before\nthe cold winds took the sand hills up by their foundations and drove\nthem down to Yerba Buena, submerging the battery and every green thing\nby the way; or the great fogs rolled down from the tule lands of the\nnorth and in from the sea, making the shivering San Franciscan forget\nthat not ten miles away the sun was as prodigal as youth.  For a few\nweeks San Francisco had her springtime, when the days were warm and the\nair of a wonderful lightness and brightness, the atmosphere so clear\nthat the flowers might be seen on the islands, when man walked with\nwings on his feet and a song in his heart; when the past was done with,\nthe future mattered not, the present with its ever changing hues on bay\nand hill, its cool electrical breezes stirring imagination and pulse,\nwas all in all.\n\nAnd it was in San Francisco's springtime that Concha Arguello made\nchocolate for the Russian to whom she was to give a niche in the\nhistory of her land; and sang at her task.  She whirled the molinillo\nin each cup as it was filled, whipping the fragrant liquid to froth;\npausing only to scold when her servant stained one of the dainty\nsaucers or cups.  Poor Rosa did not sing, although the spring attuned\nher broken spirit to a gentler melancholy than when the winds howled\nand the fog was cold in her marrow.  She had been sentenced by the last\nGovernor, the wise Borica, to eight years of domestic servitude in the\nhouse of Don Jose Arguello for abetting her lover in the murder of his\nwife.  Concha, thoughtless in many things, did what she could to\nexorcise the terror and despair that stared from the eyes of the Indian\nand puzzled her deeply.  Rosa adored her young mistress and exulted\neven when Concha's voice rose in wrath; for was not she noticed by the\nloveliest senorita in all the Californias, while others, envious and\nspiteful to a poor girl no worse than themselves, were ignored?\n\nConcha's cheeks were as pink as the Castilian roses that grew even\nbefore the kitchen door and were quivering at the moment under the\nimpassioned carolling of a choir of larks.  Her black eyes were full of\ndancing lights, like the imprisoned sun-flecks under the rose bush, and\nnever had indolent Spanish hands moved so quickly.\n\n\"Mira!  Mira!\" she cried to the luckless Rosa. \"That is the third time\nthou hast spilt the chocolate. Thy hands are of wood when they should\nbe of air.  A soft bit of linen to clean them, not that coarse rag.\nDios de mi alma!  I shall send for Malia.\"\n\n\"For the love of Mary, senorita, have pity!\" wailed Rosa.\n\"There--see--thanks to the Virgin I have poured three cups without\nspilling a drop.  And this rag is of soft linen.  Look, Dona Concha, is\nit not true?\"\n\n\"Bueno; take care thou leavest not one drop on a saucer and I will\nforgive thee--do not kiss my hand now, foolish one!  How can I whirl\nthe molinillo?  Be always good and I will burn a candle for thee every\ntime I go to the Mission.  The Russians go to the Mission this morning.\nHast thou seen the Russians, Rosa?\"\n\n\"I have seen them, senorita.  Did I not serve at table yesterday?\"\n\n\"True; I had forgotten.  What didst thou think of them?\"\n\n\"What matters it to such great folk what a poor Indian girl thinks of\nthem?  They are very fair, which may be the fashion in their country;\nbut I am not accustomed to it; and I like not beards.\"\n\n\"His excellency wore no beard--he who sat on my mother's right and\nopposite to me.\"\n\n\"He is very grand, senorita; more grand than the Governor, who after\nall has red hair and is old.  He is even grander than Don Jose, whom\nmay the saints preserve; or than the padres at the mission. Perhaps he\nis a king, like our King and natural lord in spain. (El rey nuestro y\nsenor natural.) Is he a king, senorita?\"\n\n\"No, but he should be.  Rosa, thou mayest have my red cloak that came\nfrom Mexico--last year. I have a new one and that is too small.  I had\nintended to give it to Ana Paula, but thou art a good girl and should\nhave a gay mantle for Sunday, like the other girls.  I have also a red\nribbon for thy hair--\"\n\nRosa spilt half the contents of the chocolate pot on the floor and\nConcha gave her a sound box on the ear.  However, she did not dismiss\nher, a sentence for which the trembling girl prepared herself.\n\n\"Make more--quickly!\" cried the lady of caprice. \"They come.  I hear\nthem.  But this is enough for the first.  Make the rest and beat with\nthe molinillo as I have done, and Malia will bring all to the corridor.\"\n\nShe ran to her room and her mirror.  Both were small, the room little\nmore luxurious than the cell of a nun.  But the roses hung over the\nwindow, the birds had built in the eaves, and over the wall the sun\nshone in.  In one corner was an altar and a crucifix.  If the walls\nwere rough and white, they were spotless as the hands that shook out\nand then twisted high the fine dusky masses of hair. When a fold had\nbeen drawn over either ear, in the modest fashion of the California\nmaid and wife, and the tall shell comb had fastened the rest, Concha\ninstead of finishing the headdress with her long Spanish pins, divested\nthe stems of two half-blown roses of their thorns and thrust them\nobliquely through the knot.  Her dress was of simple white linen made\nwith a very full skirt and little round jacket, but embroidered by her\nown deft fingers with the color she loved best.  She patted her frock,\nrolled down her sleeves, and went out to the \"corridor\" to stand\ndemurely behind her mother as the Russians, escorted by Father Ramon\nAbella, rode into the square.\n\nRezanov had intended merely to pay a call of ceremony upon the\nhospitable Arguellos, but after he had dismounted and kissed the hands\nof the smiling senora and her beautiful daughter he was nothing loath\nto linger over a cup of chocolate.\n\nIt was served out there in the shade of the vines. Rezanov and Concha\nsat on the railing, and the man stared over his cup at the girl with\nthe roses touching her cheeks and ruffling her hair.\n\n\"Do you like chocolate, senor?\" asked Concha, who was not in the\nintellectual mood of yesterday. \"I made it myself--I and my poor Rosa.\"\n\n\"It is the most delectable foam I have ever tasted. I am interested to\nknow that it has the solid foundation of a name.  What is the matter\nwith your Rosa?\"\n\n\"She is an unfortunate.  Her lover killed his wife, and it is said that\nshe is not innocent herself. The lover serves in chains for eight\nyears, and she is with us that we may make her repent and keep her from\nfurther sin.  She is unhappy and will marry the man when his punishment\nis over.  I am very sorry for her.\"\n\n\"Fancy you living close to a woman like that! I find it detestable.\"\n\n\"Why?--if I can do her good--and make her happy, sometimes?\"\n\n\"Does she ever talk about her life--before she came here?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; she is far too sad.  Once only, when I told her I would pray\nfor her in the Mission Church, she asked me to burn a candle that her\nlover might serve his sentence more quickly and come out and marry her.\nWill you light one for her to-day, senor?\"\n\n\"With the greatest pleasure; if you really want your maid to marry a\nman who no doubt will murder her for the sake of some other woman.\"\n\n\"Oh, surely not!  He loves her.  I know that many men love more than\nonce, but when they are punished like that, they must remember.\"\n\n\"Is it true that you are only sixteen?  Is that an impertinent\nquestion?  I cannot help it.  Those years are so few, and so much\nwisdom has gone into that little head.\"\n\n\"Sixteen is quite old.\"  Concha drew herself up with an air of offended\ndignity.  \"Elena Castro, who lives on the other side, is but eighteen\nand she has three little ones.  The Virgin brought them in the night\nand left them in the big rosebush you see before the door--one at a\ntime, of course.  Only the old nurse knew; the Virgin whispered it\nwhile she was saying a prayer for Elena; and early in the morning she\ncame and found the dear little baby and put it in Elena's arms.  I am\nthe godmother of the first--Conchitita.  In Santa Barbara, where we\nlived for some years, Anita Amanda Carillo, the friend of Ana Paula, is\nmarried, although she is but twelve and sits on the floor all day and\nplays with her dolls.  She prays every night to the Virgin to bring her\na real baby, but she is not old enough to take care of it and must\nwait.  Twelve is too young to marry.\"  Concha shook her head.  Her eyes\nwere wise, and Rezanov noted anew that her mouth alone was as young as\nher years.  \"My father would not permit such a thing.  I am glad he is\nnot anxious we should marry soon.  I should love to have the babies,\nthough; they are so sweet to play with and make little dresses for.\nBut my mother says the Virgin does not bring the little ones to good\ngirls--poor Rosa had one but it died--until their parents find them a\nhusband first.  I have never wanted a husband--\"  Concha darted a swift\nglance over her shoulder, but Santiago was in the clutches of the\nlearned doctor and wishing that he knew no Latin; \"so I go every day\nand play with Elena's babies, which is well enough.\"\n\nRezanov listened to this innocent revelation with the utmost gravity,\nbut for the first time in many years he was conscious of a novel\nfascination in a sex to which he had paid no niggard's tribute.  In his\nworld the married woman reigned; it was doubtful if he had ever had ten\nminutes' conversation with a young girl before, never with one whose\nface and form were as arresting as her crystal purity. He was\nfascinated, but more than ever on his guard. As he rode over the sand\nhills to the Mission she clung fast to his thoughts and he speculated\nupon the woman hidden away in the depths of that lovely shell like the\ndeep color within the tight Castilian buds that opened so slowly.  He\nrecalled the personalities of the young officers that surrounded her.\nThey were charming fellows, gay, kindly, honest; but he felt sure that\nnot one of them was fit to hold the cup of life to the exquisite young\nlips of Concha Arguello.  The very thought disposed him to twist their\nnecks.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nThe Mission San Francisco de Assisi stood at the head of a great valley\nabout a league from the Presidio and facing the eastern hills.  Behind\nit, yet not too close, for the priests were ever on their guard against\nIndians more lustful of loot than salvation, was a long irregular chain\nof hills, breaking into twin peaks on its highest ridge, with a lone\nmountain outstanding.  It was an imposing but forbidding mass, as steep\nand bare as the walls of a fortress; but in the distance, north and\nsouth, as the range curved in a tapering arc that gave the valley the\nappearance of a colossal stadium, the outlines were soft in a haze of\npale color.  The sheltered valley between the western heights and the\nsand hills far down the bay where it turned to the south, was green\nwith wheat fields, and a small herd of cattle grazed on the lower\nslopes.  The beauty of this superbly proportioned valley was further\nenhanced by groves of oaks and bay trees, and by a lagoon,\ncommunicating with an arm of the bay, which the priests had named for\ntheir Lady of Sorrows--Nuestra Senora de los Dolores.  The little sheet\nof water was almost round, very green and set in a thicket of willows\nthat were green, too, in the springtime, and golden in summer.  Near\nits banks, or closer to the protecting Mission--on whose land grant\nthey were built--were the comfortable adobe homes of the few Spanish\npioneers that preferred the bracing north to the monotonous warmth of\nthe south.  Some of these houses were long and rambling, others built\nabout a court; all were surrounded by a high wall, enclosing a garden\nwhere the Castilian roses grew even more luxuriantly than at the\nPresidio.  The walls, like the houses, were white, and on those of Don\nJuan Moraga, a cousin of Dona Ignacia Arguello, the roses had been\ntrained to form a border along the top in a fashion that reminded\nRezanov of the pink edged walls of Fiesole.\n\nThe white red-tiled church and the long line of rooms adjoining were\nbuilt of adobe with no effort at grandeur, but with a certain noble\nsimplicity of outline that harmonized not only with the lofty reserve\nof the hills but with the innocent hope of creating a soul in the\nlowest of human bipeds.  The Indians of San Francisco were as\nimmedicable as they were hideous; but the fathers belabored them with\nsticks and heaven with prayer, and had so far succeeded that if as yet\nthey had sown piety no higher than the knees, they had trained some\ntwelve hundred pairs of hands to useful service.\n\nOn the right was a graveyard, with little in it as yet but rose trees;\nbehind the church and the many spacious rooms built for the consolation\nof virtue in the wilderness was a large building surrounding a court.\nGirls and young widows occupied the cells on the north side, and the\nwork rooms on the east, while the youths, under the sharp eye of a lay\nbrother, were opposite.  All lived a life of unwilling industry:\ncleaning and combing wool, spinning, weaving, manufacturing chocolate,\ngrinding corn between stones, making shoes, fashioning the simple\ngarments worn by priest and Indian.  Between the main group of\nbuildings and the natural rampart of the \"San Bruno Mountains\" was the\nRancheria, where the Indian families lived in eight long rows of\nisolated huts.\n\nIn spite of vigilance an Indian escaped now and again to the mountains,\nwhere he could lie naked in the sun and curse the fetich of\ncivilization.  As the Russians approached, a friar, with deer-skin\narmor over his cassock, was tugging at a recalcitrant mule, while a\nbody-guard of four Indians stood ready to attend him down the coast in\nsearch of an enviable brother.  The mule, as if in sympathy with the\nfugitive, had planted his four feet in the earth and lifted his voice\nin derision, while the young friar, a recruit at the Mission, and far\nfrom enamored of his task, strained at the rope, and an Indian pelted\nthe hindquarters with stones.  Suddenly, the mule flung out his heels,\nthe enemy in the rear sprawled, the rope flew loose, the beast with a\nloud bray fled toward the willows of Dolores.  But the young priest was\nboth agile and angry.  With a flying leap he reached the heaving back.\nThe mule acknowledged himself conquered.  The body-guard trotted on\ntheir own feet, and the party disappeared round a bend of the hills.\n\nRezanov laughed heartily and even the glum visage of Father Abella\nrelaxed.\n\n\"It is a common sight, Excellency,\" he said.  \"We are thankful to have\na younger friar for such fatiguing work.  Many a time have I belabored\nstubborn mules and bestrode bucking mustangs while searching for one of\nthese ungrateful but no doubt chosen creatures.  It is the will of God,\nand we make no complaint; but we are very willing, Father Landaeta and\nI, that youth should cool its ardor in so certain a fashion while we\nattend to the more reasonable duties at home.\"\n\nThey were dismounted at the door of the church. The horses were led off\nby waiting Indians.  The soldiers on guard saluted and stepped aside,\nand the party entered.  Two priests in handsome vestments stood before\nthe altar, but the long dim nave was empty.  The Russians had been told\nthat a mass would be said in their honor, and they marched down the\nchurch and bent their knees with as much ceremony as had they been of\nthe faith of their hosts.  When the short mass was over, Rezanov\nbethought himself of Concha's request, and whispering its purport to\nFather Abella was led to a double iron hoop stuck with tallow dips in\nvarious stages of petition.  Rezanov lit a candle and fastened it in an\nempty socket.  Then with a whimsical twist of his mouth he lit and\nadjusted another.\n\n\"No doubt she has some fervent wish, like all children,\" he thought\napologetically.  \"And whether this will help her to realize it or not,\nat least it will be interesting to watch her eyes--and mouth--when I\ntell her.  Will she melt, or flash, or receive my offering at her\nshrine as a matter of course? I'll surprise her to-night in the middle\nof a dance.\"\n\nHe deposited a gold piece among the candles on the table and followed\nFather Abella through a side door.  A corridor ran behind the long line\nof rooms designed not only for priests but for travellers always sure\nof a welcome at these hospitable Missions.  Father Abella shuffled\nahead, halted on the threshold of a large room, and ceremoniously\ninvited his guests to enter.  Two other priests stood before a table\nset with wine and delicate confections, their hands concealed in their\nwide brown sleeves, but their unmatched physiognomies--the one lean and\njovial, the other plump and resigned--alight with the same smile of\nwelcome.  Father Abella mentioned them as his coadjutor Father Martin\nLandaeta, and their guest Father Jose Uria of San Jose; and then the\nthree, with the scant rites of genuine hospitality, applied themselves\nto the tickling of palates long unused to ambrosial living.  Responding\ningenuously to the glow of their home-made wines, they begged Rezanov\nto accept the Mission, burn it, plunder it, above all, to plan his own\nday.\n\n\"I hope that I am to see every detail of your great work,\" replied the\ndiplomatic guest of honor.  \"But at your own leisure.  Meanwhile, I beg\nthat you will order one of your Indians to bring in the little presents\nI venture to offer as a token of my respect. You may have heard that\nthe presents of his Imperial Majesty were refused by the Mikado of\nJapan.  I reserved many of them for possible use in our own\npossessions, particularly a piece of cloth of gold.  This I had\nintended for our church at New Archangel, but finding the priests there\nmore in need of punishment than reward, I concluded to bring it here\nand offer it as a manifest of my admiration for what the great\nFranciscan Order of the Most Holy Church of Rome has accomplished in\nthe Californias.  Have I been too presumptuous?\"\n\nThe priests all wore the eager expressions of children.\n\n\"Could we not see them first?\" asked Father Landaeta of his superior;\nand Father Abella sent a servant with an order to unload the horse and\nbring in the presents.\n\nNot a vestige of reserve lingered.  Priests and guests sat about the\ntable eating and drinking and chatting as were they old friends\nreunited, and Rezanov extracted much of the information he desired.\nThe white population--\"gente de razon\"--of Alta California, the\npeculiar province of the Franciscans--the Jesuits having been the first\nto invade Baja California, and with little success--numbered about two\nthousand, the Christianized Indians about twenty thousand.  There were\nnineteen Missions and four Presidial districts--San Diego, close to the\nborder of Baja California, Santa Barbara, Monterey, and San Francisco.\nEach Mission had an immense grant of land, or rancho--generally fifteen\nmiles square--for the raising of live stock, agricultural necessities,\nand the grape. At the Presidio of San Francisco there were some seventy\nmen, including invalids; and the number varied little at the other\nmilitary centres, Rezanov inferred, although there was a natural effort\nto impress the foreigner with the casual inferiority of the armed force\nwithin his ken.  Cattle and horses increased so rapidly that every few\nyears there was a wholesale slaughter, although the agricultural yield\nwas enormous.  What the Missions were unable to manufacture was sent\nthem from Mexico, and disposed of the small salaries of the priests;\nthe \"Pious Fund of California\" in the city of Mexico being\nsystematically embezzled.  The first Presidio and Mission were founded\nat San Diego in July of 1769; the last at San Francisco in September\nand October of 1776.\n\nRezanov's polite interest in the virgin country was cut short by the\nentrance of two Indians carrying heavy bundles, which they opened upon\nthe floor without further delay.\n\nThe cloth of gold was magnificent, and the padres handled it as\nrapturously as had their souls and fingers been of the sex symbolized\nwhile exalted by the essence of maternity, in whose service it would be\nanointed.  Rezanov looked on with an amused sigh, yet conscious of\nbeing more comprehending and sympathetic than if he had journeyed\nstraight from Europe to California.  It was not the first time he had\nfelt a passing gratitude for his uncomfortable but illuminating sojourn\nso close to the springs of nature.\n\nThe priests were as well pleased with the pieces of fine English cloth;\nand as their own homespun robes rasped like hair shirts, they silently\nbut uniformly congratulated themselves that the color was brown.\n\nFather Abella turned to Rezanov, his saturnine features relaxed.\n\n\"We are deeply grateful to your excellency, and our prayers shall\nfollow you always.  Never have we received presents so timely and so\nmagnificent. And be sure we shall not forget the brave officers that\nhave brought you safely to our distant shores, nor the distinguished\nscholar who guards your excellency's health.\"  He turned to Langsdorff\nand repeated himself in Latin.  The naturalist, whose sharp nose was\nalways lifted as if in protest against oversight and ready to pounce\nupon and penetrate the least of mysteries, bowed with his hand on his\nheart, and translated for the benefit of the officers.\n\n\"Humph!\" said Davidov in Russian.  \"Much the Chamberlain will care for\nthe prayers of the Catholic Church if he has to go home with his cargo.\nBut he has a fine opportunity here for the display of his diplomatic\ntalents.  I fancy they will avail him more than they did at\nNagasaki--where I am told he swore more than once when he should have\nkowtowed and grinned.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't like to see him grin,\" replied Khostov, as they finally\nstarted for the outbuildings.  \"If he could go as far as that he would\nbe the most terrible man living.  Were it not for the fire in him that\nmelts the iron just so often he would be crafty and cruel instead of\nsubtle and firm.  He is a fortunate man!  There were many fairies at\nhis cradle! I have always envied him, and now he is going to win that\nbeautiful Dona Concha.  She will look at none of us.\"\n\n\"We will doubtless meet others as beautiful at the ball to-night,\" said\nDavidov philosophically. \"You are not in love with a girl who has\nbarely spoken to you, I suppose.\"\n\n\"She had almost given me a rose this morning, when Rezanov, who was\nflattering the good Dona Ignacia with a moment of his attention, turned\ntoo soon.  I might have been air.  She looked straight through me.\nSuch eyes!  Such teeth!  Such a form! She is the most enchanting girl I\nhave ever seen. And he will monopolize her without troubling to notice\nwhether we even admire her or not.  Pray heaven he does not break her\nheart.\"\n\n\"He is honorable.  One must admit that, if he does fancy his own will\nwas a personal gift from the Almighty.  Perhaps she will break his.  I\nnever saw a more accomplished flirt.\"\n\n\"I know women,\" replied the shrewder Khostov.  \"When men like Rezanov\nmake an effort to please--\"  He shrugged his shoulders.  \"Some men are\nthe offspring of Mars and Venus and most of us are not.  We can at\nleast be philosophers. Let us hope the dinner will be excellent.\"\n\n\n\nVII\n\nIt proved to be the most delicate and savory repast that had excited\ntheir appetites this side of Europe. The friars had their consolations,\nand even Dona Ignacia Arguello was less gastronomic than Father\nLandaeta.  Rezanov, whose epicurianism had survived a year of dried\nfish and the coarse luxuries of his managers, suddenly saw all life in\nthe light of the humorist, and told so many amusing versions of his\nadventures in the wilderness, and even of his misadventure with Japan,\nthat the priests choked over their wine, and Langsdorff, who had not a\ngrain of humor, swelled with pride in his chance relationship to a man\nwho seemed able to manipulate every string in the human network.\n\n\"He will succeed,\" he said to Davidov.  \"He will succeed.  I almost\nhoped he would not, he is so indifferent--I might almost say so\nhostile--to my own scientific adventures.  But when he is in this mood,\nwhen those cold eyes brim with laughter and ordinary humanity, I am\nnothing better than his slave.\"\n\nRezanov, in reply to an entreaty from Father Uria to tell them more of\nhis mission and of the strange picture-book country they had never\nhoped to hear of at first hand, assumed a tone of great frankness and\nintimacy.  \"We were, with astounding cleverness, treated from the first\nlike an audience in a new theatre.  After we had solemnly been towed by\na string of boats to anchor, under the Papen mountains, all Nagasaki\nappeared to turn out, men, women and children.  Thousands of little\nboats, decorated with flags by day and colored lanterns by night, and\nfilled with people in gala attire, swarmed about us, gazed at us\nthrough telescopes, were so thick on the bay one could have traversed\nit on foot.  The imperial sailors were distinguished by their uniforms\nof a large blue and white check, suggesting the pinafores of a\nbrobdingnagian baby. The barges of the imperial princes were covered\nwith blue and white awnings and towed to the sound of kettledrums and\nthe loud measured cries of the boatmen.  At night the thousands of\nilluminated lanterns, of every color and shade, the waving of fans, the\nincessant chattering, and the more harmonious noise that rose\nunceasingly above, made up a scene as brilliant as it was juvenile and\nabsurd. In the daytime it was more interesting, with the background of\nhills cultivated to their crests in the form of terraces, varied with\nrice fields, hamlets, groves, and paper villas encircled with little\ngardens as glowing and various of color as the night lanterns.  When,\nat last, I was graciously permitted to have a residence on a point of\nland called Megasaki, I was conveyed thither in the pleasure barge of\nthe Prince of Fisi.  There was place for sixty oarsmen, but as one of\nthe few tokens of respect, I was enabled to record for the comfort of\nthe mighty sovereign whose representative I was, the barge was towed by\na long line of boats, decorated with flags, the voices of the rowers\nrising and falling in measured cadence as they announced to all Japan\nthe honor about to be conferred upon her.  I sat on a chair of state in\nthe central compartment of the barge, and quite alone; my suite\nstanding on a raised deck beyond.  Before me on a table, marvellously\ninlaid, were my credentials.  I was surrounded by curtains of sky-blue\nsilk and panels of polished lacquer inwrought with the Imperial arms in\ngold.  The awning of blue and white silk was lined with a delicate and\nbeautiful tapestry, and the reverse sides of the silken partitions were\nof canvas painted by the masters of the country.  The polished floor\nwas covered by a magnificent carpet woven with alarming dragons whose\njaws pointed directly at my chair of state.  And such an escort and\nsuch a reception, both of ceremony and of curiosity, no Russian had\never boasted before. Flags waved, kettledrums beat, fans were flung\ninto my very lap to autograph.  The bay, the hills, were a blaze of\ncolor and a confusion of sound.  The barracks were hung with tapestries\nand gay silks.  I, with my arms folded and in full uniform, my features\ncomposed to the impassivity of one of their own wooden gods, was the\ncentral figure of this magnificent farce; and it may be placed to the\never-lasting credit of the discipline of courts that not one of my\nstaff smiled.  They stood with their arms folded and their eyes on the\ninlaid devices at their feet.\n\n\"When this first act was over and I was locked in for the night and\nfelt myself able to kick my way through the flimsy walls, yet as\ncompletely a prisoner as if they had been of stone, I will confess that\nI fell into a most undiplomatical rage; and when I found myself played\nwith from month to month by a people I scorned as a grotesque mixture\nof barbarian and mannikin, I was alternately infuriated, and consumed\nwith laughter at the vanity of men and nations.\"\n\nHis voice dropped from its light ironical note, and became harsh and\nabrupt with reminiscent disgust.  \"And the end of it all was failure.\nThe superb presents of the Tsar were rejected.  These presents: coats\nof black fox and ermine, vases of fossil ivory and of marble, muskets,\npistols, sabers, magnificent lustres, table services of crystal and\nporcelain, tapestries and carpets, immense mirrors, a clock in the form\nof an elephant, and set with precious stones, a portrait of the Tsar by\nMadame le Brun, damasks, furs, velvets, printed cotton, cloths,\nbrocades of gold and silver, microscopes, gold and silver watches, a\ncomplete electrical machine--presents in all, of the value of three\nhundred thousand roubles, were returned with scant ceremony to the\nNadeshda and I was politely told to leave.\n\n\"But the mortification was the least of my worries.  The object of the\nembassy was to establish not only good will and friendship between\nRussia and Japan, for which we cared little, but commercial intercourse\nbetween this fertile country and our northeastern and barren\npossessions.  It would have been greatly to the advantage of the\nJapanese, and God knows it would have meant much to us.\"\n\nThen Rezanov having tickled the imaginations and delighted the\ncuriosity of the priests, began to play upon their heartstrings.  His\nown voice vibrated as he related the sufferings of the servants of the\nCompany, and while avoiding the nomenclature and details of their\nbodily afflictions, gave so thrilling a hint of their terrible\ncondition that his audience gasped with sympathy while experiencing no\nqualms in their own more fortunate stomachs.\n\nHe led their disarmed understandings as far down the vale of tears as\nhe deemed wise, then permitted himself a magnificent burst of\nspontaneity.\n\n\"I must tell you the object of my mission to California, my kind\nfriends!\" he cried, \"although I beg you will not betray me to the other\npowers until I think it wise to speak myself.  But I must have your\nsympathy and advice.  It has long been my desire to establish relations\nbetween Russia and Spain that should be of mutual benefit to the\ncolonies of both in this part of the western hemisphere.  I have told\nyou of the horrible condition and needs of my men.  They must have a\nshare in the superfluities of this most prodigal land.  But I make no\nappeal to your mercy.  Trade is not founded on charity.  You well know\nwe have much you are in daily need of.  There should be a bi-yearly\ninterchange.\"  He paused and looked from one staring face to the other.\nHe had been wise in his appeal.  They were deeply gratified at being\ntaken into his confidence and virtually asked to outwit the military\nauthorities they detested.\n\nRezanov continued:\n\n\"I have brought the Juno heavy laden, my fathers, and for the\ndeliberate purpose of barter. She is full of Russian and Boston goods.\nI shall do my utmost to persuade your Governor to give me of his corn\nand other farinaceous foods in exchange.  It may be against your laws,\nand I am well aware that for the treaty I must wait, but I beg you in\nthe name of humanity to point out to his excellency a way in which he\ncan at the same time relieve our necessities and placate his\nconscience.\"\n\n\"We will!  We will!\" cried Father Abella. \"Would that you had come in\nthe disguise of a common sea-captain, for we have hoodwinked the\ncommandantes more than once.  But aside from the suspicion and distrust\nin which Spain holds Russia--with so distinguished a visitor as your\nexcellency, it would be impossible to traffic undetected.  But there\nmust be a way out.  There shall be!  And will your excellency kindly\nlet us see the cargo?  I am sure there is much we sadly need: cloth,\nlinen, cotton, boots, shoes, casks, bottles, glasses, plates, shears,\naxes, implements of husbandry, saws, sheep-shears, iron wares--have you\nany of these things, Excellency?\"\n\n\"All and more.  Will you come to-morrow?\"\n\n\"We will! and one way or another they shall be ours and you shall have\nbreadstuffs for your pitiable subjects.  We have as much need of Europe\nas you can have of California, for Mexico is dilatory and often\ndisregards our orders altogether.  One way or another--we have your\npromise, Excellency?\"\n\n\"I shall not leave California without accomplishing what I came for,\"\nsaid Rezanov.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nConcha boxed Rosa's ears twice while being dressed for the ball that\nevening.  It was true that excitement had reigned throughout the\nPresidio all day, for never had a ball been so hastily planned. Don\nLuis had demurred when Concha proposed it at breakfast; officially to\nentertain strangers not yet officially received exceeded his authority.\nConcha, waxing stubborn with opposition, vowed that she would give the\nball herself if he did not.  Business immediately afterward took the\nCommandante ad. in. down to the Battery at Yerba Buena.  Before he left\nhe gave orders that the large hall in the barracks, where balls usually\nwere held, should be locked and the key given up to no one but himself.\nHe returned in the afternoon to find that Concha had outwitted him.\nThe sala of the Commandante's house was very large.  The furniture had\nbeen removed and the walls hung with flags, those of Spain on three\nsides, the Russian, borrowed by Santiago from the ship, at the head of\nthe room.  Concha laughed gaily as Luis stormed about the sala rasping\nhis spurs on the bare floor.\n\n\"Whitewashed walls for guests from St. Petersburg!\" she jeered, as Luis\nmenaced the flags.  \"We have little enough to offer.  Besides--what\nmore wise than to flaunt our flag in the face of the Russian bear?\nTheir flag, of course, is a mere idle compliment.  Let me tell you two\nthings, Luis mio: this morning I invited the Russians to dance\nto-night, and told Padre Abella to ask all our neighbors of the Mission\nbesides; and Rafaella Sal helped me to drape every one of those flags.\nWhen I told her you might tear them down, she vowed that if you did she\nwould dance all night with the Bostonian.\"\n\nLuis lifted his shoulders and mustache to express an attitude of\ncontemptuous resignation, but his face darkened, and a moment later he\nleft the room and strolled up the square to the grating of Rafaella Sal.\n\nConcha well knew that the frank gray eyes of the Bostonian--all\ncitizens of the United States were Bostonians in that part of the\nworld, for only Boston skippers had the enterprise to venture so\nfar--were for no one but herself.  But his face was bony and freckled,\nand his figure less in height and vigor than her own.  He was rich and\nwell-born, but shy and very modest.  Concha Arguello, La Favorita of\nCalifornia, was for some such dashing caballero as Don Antonio Castro\nof Monterey, or Ignacio Sal, the most adventurous rider of the north.\nMeanwhile he could look at her and adore her in secret, and Dona\nRafaella Sal was very kind and danced as well as himself.  He never\ndreamed that he was being used as a stalking horse to keep alive in the\nbest match in the Californias the jealous desire for exclusive\npossession that had animated him in 1800 when he had applied through\nthe Viceroy of Mexico for royal consent to his marriage with the\nFavorita of her year.  That was six years ago and never a word had come\nfrom Madrid.  Luis was faithful, but men were men, and girls grew older\nevery day.  So the wise Rafaella was alternately indifferent and\nalluring, the object of more admiration than a maid could always repel,\nyet with wells of sentiment that only one man could discover.  And the\nAmerican was patient, and even had he known, would not in the least\nhave minded the use she made of him.  He still could look at Concha\nArguello.\n\nWilliam Sturgis had sailed in one of his father's ships, now six years\nago, from Boston in search of health.  The ship in a dense fog had gone\non the rocks in the straits between the Farallones and the Bay of San\nFrancisco.  He alone, and after long hours of struggle with the wicked\ncurrents, not even knowing in what direction land might be, was flung,\nsenseless, on the shore below the Fort. For the next month he was an\ninvalid in the house of the Commandante.  Fortunately, his papers and\nmoney were sewn in an oilskin belt and his father's name was well known\nin California.  Moreover, there never was a more likable youth.  His\nillness interested all the matrons and maids of the Presidio in his\nfate; when he recovered, his good dancing and unselfishness gave him a\npermanent place in the regard of the women, while his entire absence of\nbeauty, and his ability to hold his own in the mess room, established\nhis position with the men.\n\nIn due course word of his plight reached Boston, and a ship was\nimmediately despatched, not only to bring the castaway home, but with\nthe fine wardrobe necessary to a young gentleman of his station. But\nthe same ship brought word of his father's death--his mother had gone\nlong since--and as there were brothers enamored of the business he\nhated, he decided to remain in the country that had won his heart and\ngiven him health.  For some time there was demur on the part of the\nauthorities; Spain welcomed no foreigners in her colonies. But Sturgis\nswore a mighty oath that he would never despatch a letter uninspected\nby the Commandante, that he would make no excursions into the heart of\nthe country, that he would neither engage in traffic nor interfere in\npolitics.  Then having already won the affections of the Governor, he\nwas permitted to remain, even to rent an acre of land from the Church\nin the sheltered Mission valley, and build himself a house.  Here he\nraised fruit and vegetables for his own hospitable table, chickens and\ngame cocks.  Books and other luxuries came by every ship from Boston;\nuntil for a long interval ships came no more.  One of these days, when\nthe power of the priests had abated, and the jealousy which would keep\nall Californians landless but themselves was counterbalanced by a great\nincrease in population, he meant to have a ranch down in the south\nwhere the sun shone all the year round and he could ride half the day\nwith his vaqueros after the finest cattle in the country.  He should\nnever marry because he could not marry Concha Arguello, but he could\nthink of her, see her sometimes; and in a land where a man was neither\nfrozen in winter nor grilled in summer, where life could be led in the\nopen, and the tendency was to idle and dream, domestic happiness called\non a feebler note than in less equable climes.  In his heart he was\ndesperately jealous of Concha's favored cavaliers, but it was a\njealousy without hatred, and his kind, earnest, often humorous eyes,\nwere always assuring his lady of an imperishable desire to serve her\nwithout reward.  Of course Concha treated him with as little\nconsideration as so humble a swain deserved; but in her heart she liked\nhim better than either Castro or Sal, for he talked to her of something\nbesides rodeos and balls, racing and cock-fights; he had taught her\nEnglish and lent her many books.  Moreover, he neither sighed nor\nlanguished, nor ever had sung at her grating.  But she regarded him\nmerely as an intelligence, a well of refreshment in her stagnant life,\nnever as a man.\n\n\"Rose,\" she said, as she caught her hair into a high golden comb that\nhad been worn in Spain by many a beauty of the house of Moraga, and\nspiked the knot with two long pins globed at the end with gold, while\nthe maid fastened her slippers and smoothed the pink silk stockings\nover the thin instep above; \"what is a lover like?  Is it like meeting\none of the saints of heaven?\"\n\n\"No, senorita.\"\n\n\"Like what, then?\"\n\n\"Like--like nothing but himself, senorita.  You would not have him\notherwise.\"\n\n\"Oh, stupid one!  Hast thou no imagination? Fancy any man being well\nenough as he is!  For instance, there is Don Antonio, who is so\nhandsome and fiery, and Don Ignacio, who can sing and dance and ride as\nno one else in all the Californias, and Don Weeliam Sturgis, who is\nvery clever and true.  If I could roll them into one--a tamale of corn\nand chicken and peppers--there would be a man almost to my liking.  But\neven then--not quite.  And one man--what nonsense!  I have too much\ncolor to-night, Rosa.\"\n\n\"No, senorita, you have never been so beautiful. When the lover comes\nand you love him, senorita, you will think him greater than our natural\nking and lord, and all other men poor Indians.\"\n\n\"But how shall I know?\"\n\n\"Your heart will tell you, senorita.\"\n\n\"My heart?  My father and my mother will choose for me a husband whom I\nshall love as all other women love their husbands--just enough and no\nmore.  Then--I suppose--I shall never know?\"\n\n\"Would you marry at your parents' bidding, like a child, senorita?  I\ndo not think you would.\"\n\nConcha looked at the girl in astonishment, but with a greater\nastonishment she suddenly realized that she would not.  Even her little\nfingers stiffened in a rush of personality, of passionate resentment\nagainst the shackles bound by the ages about the feminine ego.  Her\nindividuality, long budding, burst into flower; her eyes gazed far\nbeyond her radiant image in the mirror with a look of terrified but\ndauntless insight; then moved slowly to the girl that sat weeping on\nthe floor.\n\n\"I know not what thy sin was,\" she said musingly. \"But I have heard it\nsaid thou didst obey no law but thine own will--and his.  Why should\nthe punishment have been so terrible?  Thou hast sworn to me thou didst\nnot help to murder the woman.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you, senorita.  You will never know anything of sin; but\nof love--yes, I think you will know that, and before very long.\"\n\n\"Before long?\"  Concha's lips parted and the nervous color she had\ndeprecated left her cheeks. \"What meanest thou, Rosa?\"  Her voice rose\nhoarsely.\n\nAnd the Indian, with the insight of her own tragedy, replied: \"The\nRussian has come for you, senorita.  You will go with him, far away to\nthe north and the snow.  These others never could win your heart; but\nthis man who looks like a king, and as if many women had loved him, and\nhe had cared little--  Oh, senorita, Carlos was only a poor Indian, but\nthe men that women love all have something that makes them\nbrothers--the Great Russian and the poor man who goes mad for a moment\nand kills one woman that he may live with another forever.  The great\nRussian is free, but he is the same, senorita--he too could kill for\nlove, and such are the men we women die for!\"\n\nConcha, ambitious and romantic, eager for the brilliant life the advent\nof this Russian nobleman seemed to herald, had assured Santiago that he\nwould love her; but they had been the empty words of the Favorita of\nmany conquests; of love and passion she had known, suspected, nothing.\nAs she watched Rosa, huddled and convulsed, little pointed arrows flew\ninto her brain.  Girls in those old Spanish days went to the altar with\na serene faith in miracles, and it was a matter of honor among those\nthat preceded their friends to abet the parents in a custom which\nassuredly did not err on the side of ugliness.  Concha had a larger\nvocabulary than other Californians of her sex, for she had read many\nbooks, and if never a novel, she knew something of poetry.  Sturgis had\nfilled the sala with the sonorous roll of his favorite masters and it\nhad pleased her ear; but the language of passion had been so many\nbeautiful words, neither vibrating nor lingering in her consciousness.\nBut the rude expression of the miserable woman at her feet, whose sobs\ngrew more uncontrollable every moment, made it forever impossible that\nshe should prattle again as she had to Santiago and Rezanov in the last\nday and night; and although she felt as if straining her eyes in the\ndark, her cheeks burned once more, and she rose uneasily and walked to\nthe window.\n\nShe returned in a moment and stood over Rosa, but her voice when she\nspoke had lost its hoarseness and was cold and irritated.\n\n\"Control thyself,\" she said.  \"And go and bathe thine eyes.  Wouldst\nlook like a tomato when it is time to pass the dulces and wines?  And\nthink no more of thy lover until he can come out of prison and marry\nthee.\"  She drew herself away as the woman attempted to clutch her\nskirts.  \"Go,\" she said.  \"The musicians are tuning.\"\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\"The sash, Excellency?\" Jon longed to see his master in full regalia\nonce more, and after all, was not this an embassy of a sort?  But\nRezanov, who already regarded his reflection with some humor, shook his\nhead.\n\n\"I'll go as far as decency permits, for no one is so impressed by\nexternal magnificence as the Spaniard.  But full dress uniform and\norders are enough; an ambassador's sash and they might suspect I took\nthem for the children they are.  Children are not always fools.  My\nstock is too tight.  Remember that I am to dance, and am too tall for\nmost women's pretty little ears.  And I doubt if an ear is less thirsty\nfor being so provocatively screened.\"\n\nJon, a \"prince\" whose family had fallen upon evil days long since, but\nwhose thin, clever fingers were no mean inheritance, unwound and\nreadjusted the folds of soft batiste, that most becoming neck vesture\nman has ever worn.  He fain would have pressed the matter of the sash,\nbut Rezanov, most indulgent of masters to this devoted servant, was\nnever patient of insistence.  Jon also regretted the powdered wig and\nqueue, which he privately thought more befitting a fine gentleman than\nhis own hair, even though the latter were thick and bright.  He said\ntentatively:\n\n\"I notice these Californians still wear the hair long; and with their\ngay ribbons and showy hats look much better no doubt than if they\nfollowed a fashion of which it would seem they had not heard--and\nperhaps do not admire.  I ventured to pack two of your excellency's\nwigs when we were leaving St. Petersburg--\"\n\n\"Good heavens, no!\" cried Rezanov, rising to his feet and casting a\nlast impatient glance at the mirror.  \"When a man has escaped from a\nfurnace does he run back of his own accord?  My brain would cook under\na wig in this climate, and I need all my wits--for more reasons than\none.\"  And he went up on deck.\n\nThere, while awaiting his horses and escort, he had another glimpse of\nthe happy Arcadian life of the Californians.  Over the sand hills\nthrough which he had floundered twice that day rode young men in gala\nattire, a maiden, her attire as brilliant as the sunset along the\nwestern summits, on the saddle before them.  These saddles were heavy\nwith silver, the blanket beneath was embroidered with both silver and\ngold.  Gay light laughter floated out on the cool evening breeze to the\nlittle ship in the harbor.\n\n\"It has been a good day,\" thought Rezanov, lowering his glass.  \"It is\nlike her to arrange so charming a finale.\"\n\nWhen he arrived at the Presidio the guitars were tinkling and the sala\nwas full of eager and somber faces.  The Californians had come early,\ndetermined to witness the arrival of the Russians.  Very pretty most of\nthe girls were, and by no means a bevy of brunettes.  There was hair of\nevery shade of brown, looped over the ears, drawn high and confined by\nthe high comb and the long pins; and Rafaella Sal, with her red hair\nand gray eyes, was still celebrated as a beauty, although no longer in\nher first youth--she was twenty-two, and should have been a matron and\nmother long since!  But she looked very handsome and coquettish in her\ndaring yellow frock that no other red head would have dared to wear,\nand she displayed three ropes of Baja California pearls; one strand\nbeing the common possession.  The matrons, young and old, wore heavy\nsatins or brocades, either red or yellow, but the maids were in\nflowered silks, sometimes with coquettish little jacket, generally with\nlong pointed bodice and full flowing skirt.  Concha's frock was made in\nthis fashion, but quite different otherwise; an aunt in the City of\nMexico being mindful at whiles of the cravings of relatives in exile.\nIt was of a soft shimmering white stuff covered with gold spangles and\ncut to reveal her young neck and arms. She stood at the head of the\nroom with her mother as Rezanov entered, and he noticed for the first\ntime how tall she was.  She held herself proudly; mischievous twinkle,\nnor child-like trust, nor flashing coquetry possessed her eyes; these,\neven more star-like than usual, nevertheless looked upon her guests\nwith a dignified composure.  Her lips, her skin, were luminous.  In\nthis well-cut evening gown he saw that her figure was superb; and that\nshe could command stateliness as well as vivacity moved her toward a\npedestal in his regard that had been occupied by few and never for long.\n\nRezanov, in his splendid uniform and blazing orders, filled the sala\nwith his presence as he walked past the rows of bright critical eyes\ntoward his hostesses.  The young lips of the maids parted with delight\nand the men frowned.  For the first time William Sturgis felt the\nsickness of jealousy instead of its not unagreeable pain.  Davidov and\nKhostov, both handsome and well-bred young men, were also in full naval\nuniform, and by no means ignored; while Langsdorff, in the severe black\nof the scholar, was an admirable foil.\n\nRezanov, wondering at the subtle change in Concha, bowed ceremoniously\nand murmured: \"You will give me the first dance, senorita?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Excellency.  Are you not the guest of honor?\"\n\nShe motioned to the Indian musicians, fiddles and guitars fairly leaped\nto position, and in a moment Rezanov enjoyed the novel delusion of\nencircling a girl's floating wraith.\n\n\"We can waltz, you see!  Are you not surprised?\"\n\n\"It is but one accomplishment the more.  I feared a preference for your\nnative dances, but ventured to hope you would teach me.\"\n\n\"They are easy to learn.  You will watch us dance the contra-danza\nafter this.\"\n\n\"With whom do you dance it?\"\n\nHer black eyelashes were very thick; he barely caught the glance she\nshot him.\n\n\"The Russian bear growls,\" she said lightly. \"Did you expect to dance\nevery dance with me?\"\n\n\"I came for no other purpose.\"\n\n\"You would have several duels to fight to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I have no objection.\"\n\n\"You have fought others, then?\"  Her voice was the softer with the\neffort to turn its edge.\n\n\"No more than most men, I suppose.  May I ask how many have been fought\nfor you?\"\n\n\"My memory is no better than yours.  Why should I burden it with\ntrifles?\"\n\n\"True.  It doubtless is charged with matters far more serious than the\ndesires of mere men.  Tell me, senorita, what is your dearest wish?\"\nHe had bent his head and fixed his powerful gaze on her stubborn\nlashes.  As he hoped, she raised startled eyes in which an angry\nglitter dawned.\n\n\"My dearest wish?  If I had one should I tell you?  Why do you ask me\nsuch a question?\"\n\n\"Because I lit a candle at the Mission to-day that you might realize\nit,\" he answered, smiling.\n\nTo his surprise he saw a flash of terror in her eyes before she dropped\nthem, and felt her shiver. But she answered coldly:\n\n\"You have wasted a candle, senor.  I have never had a wish that was not\ninstantly gratified.  But I thank you for the kind thought.  Will you\nfinish this waltz with my friend, and the fiancee of Luis, Rafaella\nSal?  She has quarrelled with Luis, I see; Don Weeliam is dancing with\nCarolina Xime'no, and she cares to waltz with no one else.  Pardon me\nif I say that no one has ever waltzed as well as your excellency, and I\nmust not be selfish.\"\n\n\"I will release you if you are tired, but otherwise I shall do myself\nthe honor to waltz with your friend later.\"\n\n\"I must look after my other guests,\" she said coldly; and he was led\nwith what grace he could summon to the fair but sulky Rafaella.\n\n\"How am I to help flirting with that girl?\" he thought as he\nmechanically guided another light and graceful partner through the\ncrowded room.  \"If she were one girl I might resist.  But since eleven\no'clock yesterday morning she has been three.  And if she was twenty\nyesterday, twelve this morning, she is twenty-eight to-night, and this\nmight be a court ball in Madrid.  I shall leave the day after I bring\nthe Governor to terms.\"\n\nHe sat beside Dona Ignacia during the contra-danza and found the scene\nremarkably brilliant and animated considering the primitive conditions.\nIn addition to the bright flags on the wall and the vivid colors of the\nwomen, the officers of the Presidio and forts wore full dress uniform,\neither white coats with red velvet vest, red pantaloons and sash, or\nwhite trousers and scarlet coat and waistcoat faced with green.  The\nyoung men from the Mission wore small clothes of a black silk, fastened\nat the knee with silver buckles, and white silk stockings; two\ngentlemen from Monterey wore the evening costume of the capital,\ndove-colored small clothes, with white silk waistcoat and stockings,\nand much fine lawn and lace.  The room was well lighted by many wicks\nstuck in lumps of tallow.  The Indian musicians, soldiers recruited\nfrom a superior tribe in the Santa Clara valley, were clad almost\nentirely in scarlet, and danced sometimes as they played; and Indian\ngirls, in short red skirts and snow-white smocks open at the throat,\ntheir long hair decorated with flowers and ribbons, already passed\nabout wine and dulces.  The windows were open.  The sweet night air\nblew in.\n\nThe contra-danza was not unlike the square dances of England except\nthat it was far more graceful, and the men rivalled the women in their\nsupple glidings and bendings, doublings and swayings.  Concha danced\nwith Ignacio Sal, Rafaella with William Sturgis; their pliant grace, as\nfacile as grain rippling before the wind, would have put the best\nballet in Europe to the blush.  Concha's skirts swept Rezanov's feet,\nher little slippers twinkled before his admiring eyes, and he lost no\nsinuous turn or undulation of her beautiful figure; but she never\nvouchsafed him a glance.\n\nWhen the dance finished his host introduced him to the prettiest of the\ngirls and he paid them as many compliments as their heads would stand.\nHe even took some trouble to talk to them, if only to fathom the\nsources of their unlikeness to Concha Arguello. He concluded that the\ngulf that separated her from these charming, vivacious, shallow young\ngirls was not dug by education alone.  Individualities were rare enough\nin Europe; out here, in earthly, but sparsely settled paradises, they\nmust be rarer still; but that one had wandered into the lovely shell of\nConcha Arguello he no longer doubted.  The fact that it had developed\nhaphazardly, with little or no help from her sentience, and was still\nfluid and uncertain, but multiplied her in interest and charm. The\nwomen to whom he was accustomed knew themselves, consequently were no\nriddle to a man of his experience, but here he had an odd sense of\nhaving entered into a compact in the dark with a girl who might one day\nsymbolize some high and impassioned ideal he had cherished in the days\nbefore ideals had been cast aside with the negative virtues that bred\nthem.\n\nAs he coolly studied the good looks of the young caballeros and the\nplain intellectual face and slight little figure of the Bostonian,\nnoted the utter indifference with which they were treated by the\nFavorita of Presidio and Mission, he felt a sudden rush of arrogance, a\nyouthful tingling of nerves, the same prophetic sense of imminent\nhappiness and power that his first contact with the light electrical\nair and the beauty of the country had induced. After all, he was but\nforty-two.  Life on the whole had been very kind to him.  And, although\nhe did not realize it as yet, his frame, blighted by the rigors of the\npast three years, was already sensible to a renewal of juice and sap.\nHe admitted that he was more interested than he had been for many\nyears, and that if he was not in love, he tingled with a very natural\nmasculine desire for an adventure with a pretty girl.\n\nBut he was by no means a weak man, and his mind counted the cost even\nwhile his imagination hummed.  He had almost decided to bid Dona\nIgnacia an abrupt good-night, pleading fatigue, which his pallor\nindorsed, when the door of the dining-room was thrown open to the\nliveliest of fiddling, and a white hand with a singular suggestion of\ntenacity both in appearance and clasp took possession of his arm.\n\n\"My mother has gone to Gertrudis Rudisinda, who is crying,\" said\nConcha.  \"It is my pleasure to lead your excellency in to supper.\"\n\nThey sat side by side at the head of the long table almost covered by\nthe massive service of silver and loaded with evidences of Dona\nIgnacia's generosity and skill; chickens in red rice and gravy,\noysters, tamales, dulces, pastries, fruits and pleasant drinks.  Luis,\nwith Rafaella Sal dimpling and sparkling at his side, and now quite\nresigned to the semi-official nature of the ball, rose and drank the\nhealth of the distinguished guest in long and flowery praises.  Rezanov\nresponded in briefer but no less felicitous vein, and concluded by\nremarking that the only rift in the lute of his present enchanting\nexperience was the fear that whereas he had nearly died of starvation\nseveral times during the past three years, he was now threatened with a\nfar more ignominious end, so delicious and irresistible were the\ntemptations that beset the wayfarer in this most hospitable land.  Both\nspeeches were gaily applauded, the conversation became animated and\ngeneral, and Concha dropped her voice to the attentive ear beside her.\n\n\"You were very successful to-day at the Mission, Excellency.\"\n\n\"May I ask how you know?\"\n\n\"I never saw anything so serenely--arrogantly, perhaps would be a truer\ndescription--triumphant as your bearing when you walked down our humble\nsala to-night.  You looked like Caesar returned from Gaul; but I\nsuppose that all great conquests are merely the sum of many small ones.\"\n\n\"I do not regard the friendship of so shrewd a man as Father Abella a\ntrifling conquest.  And according to yourself, dear senorita, it is\nessential to the success of a mission upon which many lives and my own\nhonor depend.\"\n\n\"Is it really so serious?\" she asked with a faint sneer.\n\nHe drew himself up stiffly and his light eyes glowed with anger.  \"It\nis a subject I never should have thought of introducing at a festivity\nlike this,\" he said suavely.  \"May I be permitted to compliment you,\nsenorita, upon your marvellous grace in the contra-danza?  It quite\nturned my head, and I am delighted to hear that you will dance alone\nafter supper.\"\n\nHer face had flushed hotly.  She dropped her eyes and her voice\ntrembled as she replied: \"You humiliate me, senor, and I deserve it.\nI--my poor Rosa told me something of her great tragedy while dressing\nme, and for the moment other things seemed unimportant.  What is hunger\nand court favor beside a broken heart and a desolate life? But that of\ncourse is the attitude of an ignorant girl.\"  She raised her eyes.\nThey were soft, and her voice was softer.  \"I beg that you will forgive\nme, senor.  And be sure that I take an even deeper interest in your\ngreat mission than yesterday.  I have thought much about it, and while\nI have told my mother nothing, I have expressed certain peevish hopes\nthat a ship would not come all the way from Sitka without taking a hint\nmore than one Boston skipper must have given, and brought us many\nthings we need.  She is quite excited over the prospect of a new shawl\nfor herself, and of sending several as presents to the south; besides\nmany other things: cotton, shoes, kitchen utensils.  Have you any of\nthese things, Excellency?\"\n\nRezanov stared at her face, barely tinted with color, dully wondering\nwhy it should be so different from the one roguish, pathetically\ninnocent, that had haunted him all day.  He asked abruptly:\n\n\"Which is the friend whose little ones you envy? You have made me wish\nto see them and her?\"\n\n\"That is Elena--beside Gervasio.\"  She indicated a young woman with\nsoft, patient, brown eyes, the dignity of her race and the sweetness of\nyoung motherhood, who would have looked little older than herself had\nit not been for an already shapeless figure.  \"I can take you to-morrow\nto see them if you wish.\"\n\nShe had cast down her eyes and her face was white.  Still he groped on.\n\n\"Pardon me if I say that I am surprised your parents should permit such\na woman as this Rosa to attend you.  Why should your happy life be\ndisturbed by the lamentations of an abandoned creature--who can do you\nno good, and possibly much harm?\"\n\nStill Concha did not raise her eyes.  \"I do not think poor Rosa would\ndo anyone harm.  But perhaps it were as well she went elsewhere.  We\nhave had her long enough.  I have taken a dislike to her. I reproach\nmyself bitterly, but I cannot help it.  I should like never to see her\nagain.\"\n\n\"What has she told you?\"  Concha glanced up swiftly.  His eyes were\nblazing.  She felt quite certain that he rolled a Russian oath under\nhis tongue, and she made a slight involuntary motion toward him, her\nlips trembling apart.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she murmured.  \"I do not know--I do not know.  But I no\nlonger wish her near me. She--life is very strange and terrible, senor.\nYou know it well--I, so little.\"\n\nRezanov felt his breath short and his hands cold. For a moment he made\nno reply.  Then he smiled charmingly and said in the conventional tone\nthat was ever at his command: \"Of course you know little of life in\nthis Arcadia.  One who hopes to be numbered among the best of your\nfriends prays that you never may.  Yes, senorita, life is\nstrange--strangely commonplace and disillusionizing--but sometimes\npicturesque.  Believe me when I say that nothing stranger has ever\nbefallen me than to find out here on the lonely brink of a continent\nnearly twenty thousand versts from Europe, a girl of sixteen with the\ngrand manner, and an intellect without the detestable idiosyncrasies of\nthe fashionable bas bleus I have hitherto had the misfortune to\nencounter.\"\n\nShe was tapping the table slowly with her fork, and he noted that her\nsoft, childish mouth was set. \"No doubt you are quite right to put me\noff,\" she said finally, and in a voice as even as his own.  \"And my\nintellect would do me little good if it did not teach me to ignore\nmysteries I can never hope to fathom.  There is no such thing as life\nin your sense in this forgotten corner of the world, nor ever will be\nin my time.  If you come back and visit us twenty years hence you will\nfind me fat and worn like Elena, and busy every minute like my\nmother--unless, indeed, I marry Don Weeliam Sturgis and become a great\nlady in Boston.  It would not be so mean a fate.\"\n\nRezanov darted a look of angry contempt at the pale young man who was\neating little and miserably watching the handsome pair at the head of\nthe table.  \"You will not marry him!\" he said briefly.\n\n\"I could do far worse.\"  Concha's lashes framed an adorable glance that\nsent the blood to the hair of the sensitive youth.  \"You have no idea\nhow clever and good he is.  And--Madre de Dios!--I am so tired of\nCalifornia.\"\n\n\"But you are a part of it--the very symbol of its future, it seems to\nme.  I wish I had a sculptor in my suite.  I should make him model you,\nlabel the statue 'California,' and erect it on the peak of that big\nisland out there.\"\n\n\"That is very poetical, but after all, you are only saying that I am a\npretty savage with an education that will be more common in the next\ngeneration. It is little consolation for an existence where the most\nexciting event in a lifetime is the arrival of a foreign ship or the\ninauguration of a governor.\" And once more she smiled at Sturgis.  He\nraised his glass impulsively, and she hers in gay response.  A moment\nlater she gave the signal to leave the table. Rezanov followed her back\nto the sala chewing the cud of many reflections.\n\n\n\nX\n\nConcha had eaten no supper.  As she entered the sala she clapped her\nhands, the guests ranged themselves against the wall, the musicians,\nlivelier than ever, flew to their instruments; with the drifting,\nswaying movement she could assume at will, she went slowly, absently,\nto the middle of the room. Then she let her head drop backward, as if\nwith the weight of her hair, and Rezanov, vaguely angry, expected one\nof those appeals to the senses for which Spanish women of another sort\nwere notorious.  But Concha, after tapping the floor alternately with\nthe points and the wooden heels of her slippers, for a few moments,\nsuddenly made an imperious gesture to Ignacio Sal.  He sprang to her\nside, took her hand, and once more there was the same monotonous\ntapping of toes and heels. Then they whirled apart, bent their lithe\nbacks until their brows almost touched the floor in a salute of mock\nadmiration, and danced to and from each other, coquetry in the very\ntilt of her eyebrows, the bare semblance of masculine indulgence on his\neager, passionate face.  Suddenly to the surprise of all, she snapped\nher fingers directly under his nose, waved her hand, turned her back,\nand made a peremptory gesture to that other enamoured young swain,\nCaptain Antonio Castro of Monterey.  Don Ignacio, surprised and\ndiscomfited, retired amidst the jeers of his friends, and Concha, with\nher most vivacious and gracious manner, met Castro half way, and,\ntaking his hand, danced up and down the sala, slowly and with many\nimprovisations.  Then, as they returned to the center of the room and\nstepped lightly apart before joining in a gay whirl, she snapped her\nfingers under HIS nose, made a gesture of dismissal over her shoulder,\nand fluttered an uplifted hand in the direction of Sturgis.  Again\nthere was a delighted laughter, again a discomforted knight and a\ntriumphant partner.\n\n\"Concha always gives us something we do not expect,\" said Santiago to\nRezanov, whose eyes were twinkling.  \"The other girls dance El Son and\nLa Jota very gracefully--yes.  But Conchita dances with her head, and\nthe musicians and the partner, when she takes one, have all they can do\nto follow. She will choose you, next, senor.\"\n\nRezanov turned cold, and measured the distance to the door.  \"I hope\nnot!\" he said.  \"I should hate nothing so much as to make an exhibition\nof myself. The dances I know--that is all very well--but to\nimprovise--for the love of heaven help me to get out!\"\n\nBut Santiago, who was watching his sister intently, replied: \"Wait a\nmoment, Excellency.  I do not think she will choose another.  I know by\nher feet that she intends to dance El Son--in her own way, of\ncourse--after all.\"\n\nConcha circled about the room twice with Sturgis, lifted him to the\nseventh heaven of expectancy, dismissed him as abruptly as the others.\nLifting her chin with an expression of supreme disdain for all his sex,\nshe stood a moment, swaying, her arms hanging at her sides.\n\n\"I am glad she will not dance with Weeliam,\" muttered Santiago.  \"I\nlove him--yes; but the Spanish dance is not for the Bostonian.\"\n\nRezanov awaited her performance with an interest that caused him some\ncynical amusement. But in a moment he had surrendered to her once more\nas a creature of inexhaustible surprise.  The musicians, watching her,\nbegan to play more slowly. Concha, her arms still supine, her head\nlifted, her eyes half veiled, began to dance in a stately and measured\nfashion that seemed to powder her hair and dissolve the partitions\nbefore an endless vista of rooms.  Rezanov had a sudden vision of the\nHall of the Ambassadors in the royal palace at Madrid, where, when a\nyoung man on his travels, he had attended a state ball.  There he had\nseen the most dignified beauties of Europe dance at the most formal of\nits courts.  But Concha created the illusion of having stepped down\nfrom the throne in some bygone fashion to dance alone for her subjects\nand adorers.\n\nShe raised her arms, barely budding at the top, with a gesture that was\nnot only the poetry of grace but as though bestowing some royal favor;\nwhen she curved and swayed her body, again it was with the lofty\nsweetness of one too highly placed to descend to mere seductiveness.\nShe glided up and down, back and forth, with a dreamy revealing motion\nas if assisting to shape some vague impassioned image in the brain of a\npoet.  She lifted her little feet in a manner that transformed boards\ninto clouds.  There were moments when she seemed actually to soar.\n\n\"She is a little genius!\" thought Rezanov enthusiastically.  \"Anything\ncould be made of a woman like that.\"\n\nIt was not her dancing alone that interested him, but its effect on her\naudience.  The young men had begun with audible expressions of\napproval.  They were now shouting and stamping and clapping. Suddenly,\nas once more she danced back to the very center of the room, her bosom\nheaving, her eyes like stars, her red lips parted, Don Ignacio, long\nsince recovered from his spleen, invaded his pocket and flung a handful\nof silver at her feet.  It was a signal.  Gold and silver coins,\nchains, watches, jewels, bounced over the floor, to be laughingly\nignored.  Rezanov looked on in amazement, wondering if this were a part\nof the performance and if he should follow suit.  But after a glance at\nthe faces of the young men, lost to everything but their passionate\nadmiration for the unique and beautiful dancing of their Favorita, and\nwhen Sturgis, after wildly searching in his pockets, tore a large pearl\nfrom the lace of his stock, he doubted no longer--nor hesitated.\nFastened by a blue ribbon to the fourth button of his closely fitting\ncoat was a golden key, the outward symbol of his rank at court.  He\ndetached it, then made a sudden gesture that caught her attention.  For\na moment their eyes met.  He tossed her the bauble, and mechanically\nshe lifted her hand and caught it.  Then she laughed confusedly,\nshrugged her shoulders, bowed graciously to her audience, and signalled\nto the musicians to stop.  Rezanov was at her side in a moment.\n\n\"You must be tired,\" he said.  \"I insist that you come out on the\nveranda and rest.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she said indifferently; \"it is quite time we all went out\nto the air.  Santiago mio, wilt thou bring my reboso--the white one?\"\n\nSantiago, more flushed than his sister at her triumphs, fetched the\nlong strip of silk, and Rezanov detached her from her eager court and\nled her without.  Elena Castro followed closely, yet with a cavalier of\nher own that her friend might talk freely with this interesting\nstranger.  The night air was cool and stimulating.  The hills were\nblack under the sparks of white fire in the high arch of the California\nsky.  In the Presidio square were long blue shadows that might have\nbeen reflections of the smoldering blue beyond the stars.  Rezanov and\nConcha sat on the railing at the end of the \"corridor.\"\n\n\"It is a custom--all that very material admiration?\" he asked.\n\n\"A very old one, but not too often followed. Otherwise we should not\nprize it.  But when some Favorita outdoes herself then she receives the\ngreatest reward that man can think of--gold and silver jewels.  We do\nnot dare to return the tributes in common fashion, but they have a way\nof appearing where they belong as soon as their owners are supposed to\nhave forgotten the incident.  As you are not a Californian, senor, I\ntake the liberty of returning this without any foolish subterfuge.\"\nShe handed him his contribution.  \"I thank you all the same.  It was a\nspontaneous act, and I am very proud.\"\n\nHe accepted the key awkwardly, not daring to press it upon her, with\nthe obvious banalities.  But he felt a sudden desire to give her\nsomething, and, nothing better offering, he gathered half a dozen roses\nand laid them on her lap.\n\n\"I was disappointed that you did not wear your roses to-night,\" he\nsaid.  \"I associate them with you in my thoughts.  Will you put one in\nyour hair?\"\n\nShe found a place for two and thrust another in the neck of her gown.\nThe rest she held closely in her hands.  Then he noticed that she was\nvery white, and again she shivered.\n\n\"You are cold and tired,\" he murmured, his eyes melting to hers.  \"It\nwas entrancing, but I hope never to see you give so much of yourself to\nothers again.\"  His hand in arranging the reboso touched hers.  It\nlingered, and she stared up at him, helplessly, her eyes wide, her lips\nparted.  She reminded him of a rabbit caught in a trap, and he had a\nsudden and violent revulsion of feeling.  He rose and offered his arm.\n\"I should be a brute if I kept you talking out here.  Slip off and go\nto bed.  I shall start the guests, for I am very tired myself.\"\n\n\n\nXI\n\nHe did not talk with her again for several days.  He called in state,\nbut remained only a few moments. His officers went to several impromptu\ndances at the Presidio and Mission, but he pleaded fatigue, natural in\nthe damaged state of his constitution, and left the ship only for a\ngallop over the hills or down the coast with Luis Arguello.\n\nBut he had never felt better.  At the end of a week his pallor had\ngone, his skin was tanned and fresh.  Even his wretched crew were\ndifferent men. They were given much leave on shore, and already might\nbe seen escorting the serving-women over the hills in the late\nafternoon.  Rezanov gave them a long rope, although he knew they must\nbe germinating with a mutinous distaste of the Russian north; he kept\nstrict watch over them and would have given a deserter his due without\nan instant's pause.\n\nThe estafette that had gone with Luis' letters to Monterey had taken\none from Rezanov as well, asking permission to pay a visit of ceremony\nto the Governor.  Five days later the plenipotentiary received a polite\nwelcome to California, and protest against another long journey; the\nhumble servant of the King of Spain would himself go to San Francisco\nat once and offer the hospitality of California to the illustrious\nrepresentative of the Emperor of all the Russias.\n\nRezanov was not only annoyed at the Governor's evident determination\nthat he should see as little as possible of the insignificant military\nequipment of California, but at the delay to his own plans for\nexploration.  He knew that Luis would dare take him upon no expedition\ninto the heart of the country without the consent of the Governor, and\nhe began to doubt this consent would be given.  But he was determined\nto see the bay, at least, and he no sooner read the diplomatic epistle\nfrom Monterey than he decided to accomplish this part of his purpose\nbefore the arrival of the Governor or Don Jose.  He knew the material\nhe had to deal with at the moment, but nothing of that already, no\ndoubt, on its way to the north.\n\nEarly in the morning after the return of the courier he wrote an\ninformal note to Dona Ignacia, asking her to give him the honor of\nentertaining her for a day on the Juno, and to bring all the young\npeople she would.  As the weather was so fine, he hoped to see them in\ntime for chocolate at nine o'clock.  He knew that Luis, who was\npressingly included in the invitation, had left at daybreak for his\nfather's rancho, some thirty miles to the south.\n\nThere was a flutter at the Presidio when the invitation of the\nChamberlain was made known.  The compliment was not unexpected, but\nthere had been a lively speculation as to what form the Russian's\nreturn of hospitality would take.  Concha, whose tides had thundered\nand ebbed many times since the night of her party, submerging the happy\ninconsequence of her sixteen years, but leaving her unshaken spirit\nwith wide clarified vision, felt young to-day from sheer reaction.  She\nwould listen to no protest from her prudent mother and smothered her\nwith kisses and a torrent of words.\n\n\"But, my Conchita,\" gasped Dona Ignacia, \"I have much to do.  Thy\nfather and his excellency come in two days.  And perhaps they would not\napprove--before they are here!--to go on the foreign ship!  If Luis\nwere not gone!  Ay yi!  Ay yi!\"\n\n\"We go, we go, madre mia!  And his excellency will give you a shawl.  I\nfeel it!  I know it!  And if we go now we disobey no law.  Have they\never said we could not visit a foreign ship when they were not here?\nWe are light-headed, irresponsible women.  And if they should not let\nus go!  If the Governor and the Russian should disagree!  Now we have\nthe opportunity for such a day as we never have had before.  We should\nbe imbeciles.  We go, madre mia, we go!\"\n\nSo it proved.  At a few minutes before nine the Senora Arguello, clad\nin her best black skirt and jacket, a red shawl embroidered with yellow\ndraped over her bust with unconquerable grace, and a black reboso\nfolded about her fine proud head, rode down to the beach with Ana Paula\non the aquera behind and Gertrudis Rudisinda on her arm.  The boys\nhowled on the corridor, but the good senora felt she could not too\nliberally construe the kind invitation of a chamberlain of the Russian\nCourt.\n\nBehind her rode Concha, in white with a pink reboso; Rafaella Sal,\nCarolina Xime'no, Herminia Lopez, Delfina Rivera, the only other girls\nat the Presidio old enough to grace such an occasion; Sturgis, who\nhappened to have spent the night at the Presidio, Gervasio, Santiago\nand Lieutenant Rivera.  Castro had returned to Monterey, Sal was\nofficer of the day, and the other young men had sulkily declined to be\nthe guests of a man who looked as haughty as the Tsar himself and\nbetrayed no disposition to recognize in Spain the first nation of\nEurope.  But no one missed them.  The girls, in their flowered muslins\nand bright rebosos, the men in gay serapes and embroidered botas,\nlooked a fine mass of color as they galloped down to the beach and\nlaughed and chattered as youth must on so glorious a morning.  Even\nSturgis, always careful to be as nearly one with these people as his\ndifferent appearance and temperament would permit, wore clothes of\ngreen linen, a ruffled shirt, deer-skin botas and sombrero.\n\nThree of the ship's canoes awaited the guests, and as not one of the\nwomen had ever set foot in a boat, there was a chorus of shrieks.  Dona\nIgnacia murmured an audible prayer, and clutched Gertrudis Rudisinda to\nher breast.\n\n\"Madre de Dios!  The water!  I cannot!\" she muttered.  But Santiago\ntook her firmly by one elbow, Sturgis by the other, Davidov caught up\nthe children with a reassuring laugh, and in a moment she was trembling\nin the middle of the canoe.  Concha had already leaped into the second\nand waved a careless little salutation to the Juno.  Her eyes sparkled.\nHer nostrils fluttered.  She felt indifferent to everything but the\ncertain pleasure of the day.  Rezanov was sure to be charming.  What\nmattered the morrow, and possible nights of doubt, despair, hatred of\nlife and wondering self-contempt?\n\nRezanov awaited the canoes in the prow of the ship.  He wore undress\nuniform and a cap instead of the cocked hat of ceremony which had\nexcited their awe.  He too tingled with a sense of youthful gaiety and\nadventure.  As he helped his guests up the side of the vessel and\nlistened to the delightful laughter of the girls, saw the dancing eyes\nof even the haughty and reserved Santiago, he also dismissed the morrow\nfrom his thoughts.\n\nAs Dona Ignacia was hauled to the deck, uttering embarrassed apologies\nfor bringing the two little girls, Rezanov protested that he adored\nchildren, patted their heads and told off a young sailor to amuse them.\n\nFour tables on the deck were set with coffee, chocolate, Russian tea,\nand strange sweets that the cook had fashioned from ingredients to\nwhich his skilful fingers had long been strangers.\n\nDona Ignacia sat beside the host, and when she had tried both the tea\nand the coffee and had demanded the recipe of the sweets, he said\ncasually: \"After breakfast I shall ask you to go down to the cabin for\na few moments.  I bought the cargo with the Juno, and find there are\nseveral articles which I shall beg as a great favor to present to my\nkindest hostesses and the young girls she has been good enough to bring\nto my ship.  Shawls and ells of cotton and all that sort of thing are\nof no use to a bachelor, and I hope you will rid me of some of them.\"\n\nDona Ignacia lost all interest in the breakfast, and presently,\nmurmuring an excuse, was escorted by Langsdorff down to the cabin.\nWhen the light repast was over, Rezanov made a signal to several\nsailors who awaited commands, and they sprang to the anchor and sails.\n\n\"We are going to have a cruise,\" announced the host to his guests.\n\"The bay is very smooth, there is a fine breeze, we shall neither be\nbecalmed nor otherwise the sport of inclement waters.  I know that most\nof you have never seen this beautiful bay and that you will enjoy its\nscenery as much as I shall.\"\n\nHe moved to Concha's side and dropped his voice. \"This is for you,\nsenorita,\" he said.  \"You want change, variety, and I have planned to\ngive you all that I can in one day.  I expect you to be happy.\"\n\n\"I shall be,\" she said dryly, \"if only in watching a diplomat get his\nway.  You will see every corner of our bay, and I shall have the\ndelightful sensation of doing something for which I cannot be held\nresponsible.\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"I am quite willing that you should understand me,\" he\nsaid.  \"But it is true that I thought as much of you as of myself.\"\n\nIn a few moments the ship was under way.  Santiago and Sturgis had gone\ndown to the cabin to reassure Dona Ignacia, who uttered a loud cry as\nthe Juno gave a preliminary lurch.  Gervasio and Rivera had opened\ntheir eyes as Rezanov abruptly unfolded his plan, but dropped them\nsleepily before the delight of the girls.  After all, it was none of\ntheir affair, and what was a bay?  If they requested him, as a point of\nhonor, to refrain from examining the battery of Yerba Buena with his\nglass, their consciences would be as light as their hearts.\n\nAs Rezanov stood alone with Concha in the prow of the ship and\nalternately cast softened eyes on her intense, rapt face, and shrewd\nglances on the ramifications of the bay, he congratulated himself upon\nhis precipitate action and the collusion of nature. They were sailing\neast, and would turn to the north in a moment.  The mountain range bent\nabruptly at the entrance to the bay, encircling the immense sheet of\nwater in a chain of every altitude and form: a long hard undulating\nline against the bright blue sky; smooth and dimpled slopes as round as\ncones, bare but for the green of their grasses; lofty ridges tapering\nto hills in the curve at the north but with blue peaks multiplying\nbeyond.  There were dense forests in deep canyons on the mountainside,\nbare and jagged heights, the graceful sweep of valleys, promontories\nleaping out from the mainland like mammoth crocodiles guarding the bay.\nThe view of the main waters was broken by the largest of the islands,\nbut far away were the hills of the east and the soft blue peaks behind.\nAnd over all, hills and valley and canyon and mountain, was a bright\nopalescent mist.  Green, pink, and other pale colors gleamed as behind\na thin layer of crystal. Where the sun shone through a low white cloud\nupon a distant slope there might have been a great globe of iridescent\nglass illuminated within.  The water was a light, soft, filmy yet\ntranslucent blue. Concha gazed with parted lips.\n\n\"I never knew before how wonderful it was,\" she murmured.  \"I have been\ntaught to believe that only the south is beautiful, and when we had to\ncome here again from Santa Barbara it was exile. But now I am glad I\nwas born in the north.\"\n\n\"I have watched the light on these hills and islands, and what I could\nsee of the fine lines of the mountains ever since I came, and were\nthere but villas and castles, these waters would be far more beautiful\nthan the Lake of Como or the Bay of Naples.  But I am glad to see trees\nagain.  From our anchorage I had but a bare glimpse of two or three.\nThey seem to hide from the western winds. Are they so strong, then?\"\n\n\"We have terrible winds, senor.  I do not wonder the trees crouch to\nthe east.  But I must tell you our names.\"  She pointed to the largest\nof the islands, a great bare mass that looked as had it been, when\nviscid, flung out in long folds from a central peak, concaving here and\nthere with its own weight. Its southern point was on a line with a\npoint of mainland far to the west, and its northern, from their vantage\nlooking to be but a continuation of the curve of the mainland, finished\nan arc of almost perfect proportions, whose deep curve was a tumbled\nmass of hills and one great mountain.  \"That is Nuestra Senora de los\nAngeles, and it opens a triple jaw, Luis has told me, at Point\nTiburon--you will soon see the straits between.  The big rock over\nthere is Alcatraz, and farther away still is Yerba Buena--that looks\nlike a camel on its knees.\"\n\nBut Rezanov was examining the scene before him.  The lines of this bay\nwithin a bay were superb, and in its wide embrace, slanting from Point\nTiburon toward an inner point two miles opposite was another island, as\nsteep as Alcatraz, but long and waving of outline, with a glimpse of\ntrees on its crest.  Rezanov, while he lost nothing of the picturesque\nbeauty surrounding him, was more deeply interested in noting the many\nfoundations, sheltered and solid, for fortifications that would hold\nthese rich lands against the fleets of the world.  Never had he seen so\nmany strategic advantages on one sheet of water.  The islands farther\nsouth he had examined through his glass from the deck of the Juno until\nhe knew every convolution they turned to the west.\n\nConcha was directing his attention to the tremendous angular peak\nrising above the tumbled hills. \"That is Mount Tamalpais--the mountain\nof peace. It was named by the Indians, not by us.  Sometimes it is like\na great purple shadow, and at others the clouds fight about it like the\nghosts of big sea gulls.\" They were sailing past the rounded end of the\nwestern inner point of the little bay.  It was almost detached from the\nbare ridge behind and half covered with oaks and willow trees.  \"That\nis Point Sausalito.  I have often looked at it through the glass and\nlonged for a merienda in the deep shade.\" She turned to Rezanov with\nlips apart.  \"Could we not--oh, senor!--have our dinner on shore?\"\n\n\"It is only for you to select the spot.  We can sail many miles before\nit is time for dinner, and you may find a place even more to your\nliking.  I fancy we can not go far here.  It looks swampy and shallow.\nNothing could be less romantic than to stick in the mud.\"\n\n\"May I ask,\" said Concha demurely, \"how you dare to run the risks of an\nunknown sheet of water? I have heard it said that there is more than\none rock and shoal in this bay.\"\n\n\"I am not as rash as I may appear,\" replied Rezanov dryly, but smiling.\n\"In 1789 there was a chart of this bay, taken from a Spanish MSS.,\npublished in London; and I bought it there when I ran up from the\nNadeshda--anchored at Falmouth--three years ago.  Davidov, who, you may\nobserve, is steering, oblivious to the charms of even Dona Carolina,\nknows every sounding by heart.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"  Concha shrugged her shoulders.  \"The Governor, too, is very\nclever.  It will be a drawn battle.  Perhaps I shall remain neutral\nafter all.  It would be more amusing.\"  The ship was turning, and she\nwaved her hand to the island between the deep arc of the hilly coast.\n\"I have heard so much of the beauty of that island,\" she said, \"that I\nhave called it La Bellissima, but I never hoped to see anything but the\nback of its head, from which the wind has blown all the hair.  And now\nI shall.  How kind of you, senor!\"\n\n\"How easily you are made happy!\" he said, with a sigh.  \"You look like\na child.\"\n\n\"To-day I shall be one; and you the kind fairy god-father,\" she added,\nwith some malice.  \"How old are you, senor?\"\n\n\"Forty-two.\"\n\n\"That is twenty-six years older than myself.  But your excellency might\npass for thirty-five,\" she added politely.  \"We have all said it.  And\nnow that you are not so pale you will soon look younger--and even more\ntriumphant than when you came.\"\n\n\"I have never felt so triumphant as on this morning, dear senorita.  I\nhad not hoped to give you so much pleasure.\"\n\nHer cheeks were as pink as her reboso, her great black eyes were\ndancing.  Her hands strained at the railing.  \"I shall see La\nBellissima!  La Bellissima!\" she cried.\n\nThey rounded the low broken point of the island, sailed through the\nracing currents between the lower end of La Bellissima and \"Our Lady of\nthe Angels,\" more slowly past what looked to be a perpendicular forest.\nFrom water to crest the gulches and converging spurs of this hillside\nin the sea were a dense mass of oaks, bays, underbrush; here and there\na tall slender tree with a bark like red kid and a flirting polished\nleaf, at which Concha clapped her hands as at sight of an old friend\nand called \"El Madrono.\"  It was a primeval bit of nature, but sweet\nand silent and peaceful; there was no suggestion either of gloom or of\ndiscourteous beast.\n\n\"We shall have our dinner here, Excellency. There on that little beach;\nand afterward we shall climb to the top.  See, there are trails!  The\nIndians have been here.\"\n\nThey stood out through the straits between Point Tiburon and the Isle\nof the Angels, where the tide ran fast.  Then, for the first time, was\nRezanov able to form a definite idea of the size and shape of this\ngreat natural harbor.  To the south it extended beyond the peninsula in\nan unbroken sheet for some forty English miles.  Ten miles to the north\nthere was a gateway between the lower hills which Luis had alluded to\nas leading into the bay of Saint Pablo, another large body of\ntidewater, but inferior in depth and beauty to the Bay of San Francisco.\n\nThe mist had dissolved.  The greens were vivid where the sun shone on\nisland and hill.  The woods of Bellissima, the groves of Point\nSausalito, the forests in the northern canyons, deepened to purple like\nthat of the great bare sweep of Tamalpais.  Only the farther peaks\nremained a pale misty blue, and were of an indescribable floating\ndelicacy.\n\nConcha pointed to the eastern double cone.  \"That is Monte del Diablo.\nOnce they say it spouted fire, but that was long ago, and all our\nvolcanoes are dead.  But perhaps not so long ago.  The Indians tell the\nstrange story that their grandfathers remembered when this bay was a\nvalley covered with oak trees, and the rivers of the north flowed\nthrough and emptied into Lake Merced and a rift by the Fort.  Then came\na tremendous earthquake and rent the mountains apart where you came\nthrough--we call it the Mouth of the Gulf of the Farallones--the valley\nsank, the sea flowed in, only these hills that are islands now keeping\ntheir heads above the flood.  Perhaps it is true, for Drake was close\nto this bay for a long while and never saw it, and it would have given\nhim a better shelter than the little harbor he found a few miles higher\non the coast.  I believe it was not here.  Madre de Dios, I hope\nCalifornia shakes no more.  She would--is it not true, Excellency?--be\nthe most perfect country in all the world did she not have the devil in\nher.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid of earthquakes?\" asked Rezanov, who once more had\ntransferred his comprehensive gaze from battery sites to her face.\n\n\"I cross myself.  It is like feeling your grave turn over.  But I fancy\nthe poor old earth is like the people on her; she gets tired of being\ngood and is all the naughtier for having been sober too long. Don\nVincente Rivera is an example; he is cold, haughty, solemn, stern to\nothers and himself, as you see him; but once in a while--Madre de Dios!\nThe Presidio does not sleep for three nights!\"\n\nRezanov laughed heartily, then turned abruptly away.  \"Come,\" he said.\n\"I had almost forgotten. Will you ask the others to go to the cabin,\nwhile I give orders that dinner shall be served on your island?\"\n\nIn the cabin, Concha forgot him for a few moments.  Her mother, her\neyes dwelling fondly upon several shawls she hoped were intended for\nherself alone, was hushing the baby to sleep in the deep chair of his\nexcellency.  Ana Paula was playing with an Alaskan doll she had\nappropriated without ceremony.  Rezanov came in when his guests were\nassembled, and he had a gift for each; curious objects of Alaskan\nworkmanship for the men, miniature totem poles and fur-bordered\nmoccasins; but silk and cotton, linen, shawls, and find handkerchiefs\nfor senora and maiden.\n\n\"They are trifles,\" he said, in response to an enthusiastic chorus.\n\"The cargo I was obliged to take over was a very large one.  You must\nnot protest.  I shall never miss these things.\"  And he knew that he\nhad sown the seeds of a rapacity similar to that implanted in the\nworthy bosoms of the priests when they had paid him their promised\nvisit. If the Governor were insensible to diplomacy he would have\npressure brought to bear upon his official integrity from more quarters\nthan one.\n\n\"There are also many of the presents rejected by the Mikado,\nsomewhere,\" he added carelessly.  \"But I could not find them.  They\nmust have found their way to the bottom of the hold during one of the\nstorms we encountered on our way from Sitka.\"\n\nHe certainly looked the fairy godfather, and quite impartial as he\ndistributed his offerings with a chosen word to each; his memory for\nlittle characteristics was as remarkable as for names and faces. He had\ntaken off his cap on deck, and the breeze had ruffled his thick fair\nhair, brought the blood to his thin cheeks.  The lines of his face, cut\nby privation and anxiety and illness, had almost disappeared with the\nrenewed elasticity of the flesh, and his blue eyes were wide open, and\nsparkling in sympathy with the pleasure of his guests and the success\nof his own strategy.  These few insignificant Spaniards dislodged, a\nhalf-dozen forts in this harbor, and the combined navies of the world\nmight be defied; while a great chain of hungry settlements fattened and\nprospered exceedingly on the beneficence of the most fertile land in\nall the Americas.\n\n\n\nXII\n\nThe eastern mountains looked very close from the crest of La Bellissima\nand of a singular transparency and variety of hue.  It was as if the\nwhite masses of cloud sailing low overhead flung down great splashes of\ncolor from prismatic stores stolen from the sun.  There was a vivid\npale green on the long sweep of a rounding slope, deep violet and pale\npurple in dimple and hollow, red showing through green on a tongue of\nland running down from the north; and on the lower ridges and little\nislands, pale and dark blue, and the most exquisite fields of lavender.\nThis last tint was reflected in the water immediately below the ridge,\nand farther out there were lakelets of pale green, as if the islands,\ntoo, had the power to mirror themselves when the sea itself was glass.\n\nSantiago, Davidov, Carolina Xime'no, Delfina Rivera, Concha and\nRezanov, had climbed to the ridge. The other young people had given out\nhalfway up the steep and tangled ascent and returned to the beach.\nDona Ignacia immediately after dinner had frankly asked her host for\nthe hospitality of his stateroom.  She and her little ones must have\ntheir siesta, and the good lady was convinced that so high and mighty a\npersonage as the Russian Chamberlain was all the chaperon the\nproprieties demanded.\n\nFour of the party strayed along the crest in search of the first wild\npansies.  Rezanov and Concha looked under the sloping roof of brittle\nleaves into dim falling vistas, arches, arbors, caverns, a forest in\nminiature with natural terraces breaking the precipitous wall of the\nisland.\n\n\"I should like to live here,\" said Concha definitely.\n\n\"It would make a fine estate for summer life--or for a honeymoon.\"  He\nsmiled down upon his companion, who stood very tall and straight and\nproud beside him.  \"If you conclude to marry your little Bostonian no\ndoubt he will buy it for you,\" he said.\n\nIf he had hoped to see a look of blank dismay after his hours of\ndevotion he was disappointed. She made a little face.\n\n\"I do not think I could stand a desert island with the good Weeliam.\nFor that I should prefer one of my own sort--Ignacio, or Fernando.\nBetter still, I could come here and be a hermit.\"\n\n\"A hermit?\"\n\n\"In some ways that would suit me very well.  All human beings become\ntiresome, I find.  I shall have a little hut just below the crest where\nI can look from my window right into the woods that are so quiet and\ngreen and beautiful.  That is a thought that has always fascinated me.\nAnd when I walk on the crest I can see all the beauty of mountain and\nbay.  What more could I want?  What more have you in your world when\nyou know it too well, senor?\"\n\n\"Nothing; but you might tire, too, of this.\"\n\n\"What of it?  It would be the gentle sad ennui of peace, not of\ndisillusion, senor.  How I wish you would tell me all you know of life!\"\n\n\"God forbid.  And do not remind me of ennui and disillusions.  I have\nforgotten both in California. Perhaps, after all, I shall not return to\nSt. Petersburg.  There is a vast empire here--\"\n\n\"But it is not yours or Russia's to rule, Excellency,\" she interrupted\nhim softly.\n\nHe did not color nor start, but met her eyes with his deep amused\nglance.  \"I, too, can dream, senorita.  Of a great and wonderful\nkingdom--that never will exist, perhaps.  I have always been called a\ndreamer, but the habit has grown since I came to this lovely unreal\nland of yours.\"\n\n\"Have you the intention to take it from us, Excellency?\" she asked\nquietly.\n\n\"Would you betray me if you thought I had?\"\n\nHer eyes responded for a moment to the magnetism of his, and then she\ndrew herself up.\n\n\"No, senor, I could not betray a man who had been our guest, and Spain\nneeds no assistance from a weak girl to hold her own against Russia.\"\n\n\"Well said!  I kiss your hands, as they say in Vienna.  But we must\nsail again.  I told them to be ready at three o'clock.\"\n\nDalliance with the most alluring girl he had ever known was all very\nwell, but the day's work was not yet done.  When they returned to the\nship he deliberately engaged all the Spaniards in a game of cards,\nordered cigarettes and a bowl of punch for their refreshment, and then\nthe Juno steered south.\n\nThey sailed swiftly past Nuestra Senorita de los Angeles and the\neastern side of Alcatraz, Rezanov sweeping every inch with his glass;\nmore slowly past the peninsula where it came down in a succession of\nrough hills almost in a straight line from the Presidio, ascending to a\nhigh outpost of solid rock, whence it turned abruptly to the south in a\nwaving line of steep irregular cliffs, harsh, barren, intersected with\ngullies.  Then the land became suddenly as flat as the sea, save for\nthe shifting dunes: the desert porch of the great fertile valley hidden\nfrom the water by the waves of sand, but indicated by its rampart of\nmountains.  The shallow water curved abruptly inward between the rocky\nmass on the right and a gentler incline and point two miles below.  At\nits head was the \"Battery of Yerba Buena,\" facing the island from which\nit took its name.  Rezanov scrupulously kept his word and did not raise\nhis glass, but one contemptuous glance satisfied his curiosity.  His\neye rolled over the steep hills that were designed to bristle with\nforts, and, as sometimes happened, when he spoke again to Concha, whom\nhe kept close to his side, for the other girls bored him, his words did\nnot express the workings of his mind.\n\n\"Athens has no finer site than this,\" he said.  \"I should like to see a\nwhite marble city on these hills, and on that plain, when all the sand\ndunes are leveled.  Not in our time, perhaps!  But, as I told you, I\nhave surrendered myself to the habit of dreaming.\"\n\nConcha shrugged her shoulders and made no reply at the moment.  As they\nsailed toward the east before turning south again, she pointed across\nthe great silvery sheet of water melting into the misty southern\nhorizon, to a high ridge of mountains that looked to be a continuation\nof the San Bruno range behind the Mission, but slanting farther west\nwith the coast line.\n\n\"Those are behind our rancho, senor--Rancho El Pilar, or Las Pulgas, as\nsome prefer.  Perhaps my father will take you there.  I hope so, for we\nlove to go, and may not too often; my father is very busy here.  He is\none of the few that has received a large grant of land, and it is\nbecause the clergy love him so much they oppose his wish in nothing.\nDo you see those sharp points against the sky?  They are the tops of\nlofty trees, like the masts of giant ships, and with many rigid arms\nspiked like the pines. You saw a few of them in the hollow below\nTamalpais, but up on those mountains there are miles and miles of\nmighty forests.  No white man has ever penetrated them, nor ever will,\nperhaps.  We have no use for them, and even if you made this your\nkingdom, senor, I suppose not many would come with you.  Far, far down\nwhere the water stops are the Mission of Santa Clara and the pueblo of\nSan Jose; but I have heard you cannot approach within many miles of the\nland in a boat.\"\n\nWhen they had sailed south for a few moments the boat came about\nsharply.  Concha laughed.  \"I had forgotten the chart.  I rather hoped\nyou would run on a shoal.\"\n\nBut as they approached the cove of Yerba Buena again she caught his arm\nsuddenly, unconscious of the act, and the little dancing lights of\nhumor in her eyes went out.  \"Your white city, senor!  Ay, Dios! what a\ncity of dreams that can never come true!\"\n\nThe soft white fog that sometimes, even at this season, came in from\nthe sea, was rolling over the hills between the Battery and the\nPresidio, wreathing about the rocky heights and slopes.  It broke into\ndomes and cupolas, spires and minarets.  Great waves rolled over the\nsand dunes and beat upon the cliffs with the phantoms clinging to its\nsides. Then the sun struggled with a thousand colors. The sun\nconquered, the mist shimmered into sunlight, and once more the hills\nwere gray and bare.\n\nRezanov laughed, but his eyes glowed down upon her.  \"I am not sure it\nwas there,\" he said.  \"I have an idea your imagination and touch acted\nas a sort of enchanter's wand.  The others evidently saw nothing.\"\n\n\"The others saw only fog and shivered.  But it was there, senor!  We\nhave had a vision.  A Russian city!  Ay, yi!\"\n\nBut Rezanov had forgotten the city.  Her reboso had fallen and a strand\nof her hair blew across his face.  His lips caught it and his eyes\nburned.  They rounded a headland and the world looked green and young.\n\n\"Concha!\" he whispered.\n\nHer eyes flashed and melted, she lifted her chin; then burst into a\nmerry ripple of laughter.\n\n\"Senor!\" she said, \"if you make love to me, I shall have to compare you\nwith many others, and I might not like the Russian fashion.  You are\nmuch better as you are--very grand seigneur, iron-handed and absolute,\nhaughty and arrogant, but the most charming person in the world, with\nends to gain, even from such humble folk as a handful of stranded\nCalifornians.  But to sigh! to languish with the eye! to sing at the\ngrating!  I fear that the lightest headed of the caballeros you despise\ncould transcend you in all.\"\n\n\"Very likely!  I have not the least intention of sighing or languishing\nor singing at gratings.  But if we were alone I certainly should kiss\nyou.\"\n\nBut her eyes did not melt again at the vision. She flushed hotly with\nannoyance.  \"I am a child to you!  Were it not that I have read a few\nbooks, you would find me but a year older than Ana Paula.  Well!\nRegard me as a child and do not attempt to flirt with me again.  Shall\nit be so?\"\n\n\"As you wish!\"  Rezanov looked at her half in resentment, half\nwistfully, then shrugged his shoulders, and called to Davidov to steer\nfor the anchorage.  She was quite right; and on the whole he was\ngrateful to her.\n\n\n\nXIII\n\n\"Concha,\" said Sturgis abruptly, \"will you marry me?\"\n\nConcha, who was sitting in the shade of the rose vines on the corridor\nmaking a dress for Gertrudis Rudisinda, ran the needle into her finger.\n\n\"Madre de Dios!\" she cried angrily.  \"Who would have expected such\nfoolish words from you? and now I have pricked my finger and stained my\nlittle frock.  It will have to be washed before worn, and is never so\npretty after.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Sturgis humbly.  \"But it seems to me that if a man\nwishes to marry a maid he should ask her in a straightforward manner,\nwith no preliminary sighs and hints and serenades--and all sorts of\ninsincere stage play.\n\n\"He should at least address her parents first.\"\n\n\"True.  I was wholly the American for the moment.  May I speak to Don\nJose and Dona Ignacia, Concha?\"\n\n\"How can I prevent?  No, I will not coquet with you, Weeliam.  But I am\nangry that you have thought of such nonsense.  Such friends as we were!\nWe have talked and read together by the hour, and my parents have\nthought no more of it than if it had been Santiago.  There!  You have a\nnew book in your pocket.  Why did you not read it to me instead of\nmaking love?  Let me see it.\"\n\n\"I brought it to read later if you wished, but I came to ask you to\nmarry me and to receive your answer.  I never expected to ask\nyou--but--lately--things have changed--life seems, somehow, more real.\nThe thought of losing you has suddenly become terrible.\"\n\n\"You have been drinking Russian tea,\" said Concha, stitching quietly\nbut flashing him a glance of amusement, not wholly without malice.\n\n\"It is true,\" he replied.  \"I suppose I never really believed you would\nmarry Raimundo or Ignacio or any of the caballeros.  They think and\ntalk of nothing but horse-racing, gambling, cock-fighting, love and\ncigaritos.  I thought of you always here, where at least I could look\nat you or read with you.  But one must admit that this Russian is no\nordinary man.  I hate him, yet like him more than any I have ever met.\nLast night I stayed to punch with him, and we talked English for an\nhour.  That is to say, he did; I could have listened to him till\nmorning. Langsdorff says that he has the greatest possible command of\nhis native tongue, but he speaks English well enough.  I wish I could\ndespise him, but I do not believe I even hate him.\"\n\n\"Well?\" demanded Concha.  She kept her eyes on her work (and the\ndelight that rose in her breast from her voice).\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Why should you hate him?\"\n\n\"Do you ask me that, Concha, when he makes a fence of himself about\nyou, and his fine eyes--practised is nearer the mark--look at no one\nelse?\"\n\n\"But why should that cause you jealousy?  He is a man of the world,\naccustomed to make himself agreeable, and I am the daughter of the\nCommandante.\"\n\n\"He is more in love with you than he knows.\"\n\n\"Do you think so, Weeliam?\"  Still her voice was innocent and even,\nalthough the color rose above the inner commotion.  \"But even so, what\nof it? Have not many loved me?  Am I to be won by the first stranger?\"\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\nThe tumult in Concha turned to wrath, and she lifted flashing eyes to\nhis moody face.  \"Do you presume to say you are jealous because you\nthink I love him--a stranger I have known but a week--who looks upon me\nas a child--who has never--never thought--\"  But her dignity, flying to\nthe rescue, assumed control.  Her upper lip curled, her body stiffened\nfor a moment, and she went on with her stitching.  \"You deserve I\nshould rap your silly little skull with my thimble.  You are no better\nthan Ignacio and Fernando.  Such scenes as I have had with them!  They\nwanted to fight the Russian! How he would laugh at them!  I have\nthreatened they shall both be sent to San Diego if there is any more\nnonsense.\"  Then curiosity overcame her. \"You never had the least,\nleast reason to think I would marry you, and now, according to your own\nwords, you think you have less.  Then why, pray, did you address me?\"\n\n\"Because I am a man, I suppose.  I could not sit tamely down and see\nyou go.\"\n\nShe looked at him with a slight access of interest. A man?  Perhaps he\nwas, after all.  And his well-bred, bony face looked very determined,\nalbeit the eyes were wistful.  Suddenly she felt sorry for him; and she\nhad never experienced a pang of sympathy for a suitor before.  She\nleaned forward and patted his hand.\n\n\"I cannot marry you, dear Weeliam,\" she said, and never had he seen her\nso sweet and adorable, although he noted with a pang that her mouth was\nalready drawn with a firmer line.  \"But what matter?  I shall never\nmarry at all.  For many years--forty, fifty perhaps--I shall sit here\non the veranda, and you shall read to me.\"\n\nAnd then she shivered violently.  But she set her mouth until it was\nalmost straight, and picked up the little dress.  \"Not that, perhaps,\"\nshe said quietly in a moment.  \"I sometimes think I should like to be a\nnun, that, after all, it is my vocation. Not a cloistered one, for that\nis but a selfish life. But to teach, to do good, to forget myself.\nThere are no convents in California, but I could join the Third Order\nof the Franciscans, and wear the gray habit, and be set aside by the\nworld as one that only lived to make it a little better.  To forget\noneself! That, after all, may be the secret of happiness.  I envy none\nof my friends that are married.  They have the dear children, it is\ntrue.  But the children grow up and go away, and then one is fat and\neats many dulces and the siesta grows longer and longer and the face\nvery brown.  That is life in California. I should prefer to work and\npray, and\"--with a flash of insight that made her drop her work again\nand stare through the rose-vines--\"to dream always of some beautiful\nthing that youth promised but never gave, and that given might have\nended in dull routine and a brain so choked with little things that\nmemory too held nothing else.\"\n\n\"But Concha,\" cried Sturgis eagerly, \"I could give you far better than\nthat.  I could take you away from here--to Boston, to Europe.  You\nshould see--live your life--in the great cities you have dreamed\nof--that you hardly believe in--that were made to enjoy.  I have told\nyou of the theater, the opera--you should go to the finest in the\nworld. You should wear the most beautiful gowns and jewels, go to\ncourts, see the great works of art--I am not trying to bribe you,\" he\nstammered, flushing miserably.  \"God forbid that I should stoop to\nanything as mean as that.  But it all rushed upon me suddenly that I\ncould give you so much that you were made for, with this worthless\nmoney of mine. And what happiness to be in Europe with\nyou--what--what--\"\n\nHis voice trembled and broke, and he dared not look at her.  Again she\nstared through the vines. A splendid and thrilling panorama rose beyond\nthem, her bosom heaved, her lips parted.  She saw herself in it, and\nnot alone.  And not, alas, with the honest youth whose words had\ninspired it.  In a moment she shook her head and turned her eyes on the\nflushed, averted face of her suitor.\n\n\"I shall never see Europe,\" she said gently, \"and I shall never marry.\"\n\n\"Not if this Russian asks you?\" cried Sturgis, in his jealous misery.\n\nBut Concha's anger did not rise again.  \"He has no intention of asking\na little California girl to share the honors of one of the most\nbrilliant careers in Europe,\" she said calmly.  \"Set your mind at rest.\nHe has paid me no more attention than is due my position as the\ndaughter of the Commandante, and perhaps of La Favorita.  If I flirt a\nlittle and he flirts in response, that is nothing.  Is he not then a\nman?  But he will forget me in a month.  The world, his world, is full\nof pretty girls.\"\n\n\"A week ago you would not have said that,\" said Sturgis shrewdly.\n\"There has been nothing in your life to make you so humble.\"\n\n\"I cannot explain, but he seems to have brought the great world with\nhim.  I know, I understand so many things that I had not dreamed of a\nweek ago.  A week!  Madre de Dios!\"\n\nAnd Sturgis, who after all was a gallant gentleman, made no comment.\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nGovernor Arrillaga, Commandante Arguello, and Chamberlain Rezanov sat\nin the familiar sala at the Presidio content in body after a culinary\nachievement worthy of Padre Landaeta, but perturbed and alert of mind.\nUpon the arrival of the two California dignitaries in the morning,\nRezanov had sent Davidov and Langsdorff on shore to assure them of his\ngratitude and deep appreciation of the hospitality shown himself, his\nofficers and men.  The Governor had replied with a fulsome apology for\nnot repairing at once to the Juno to welcome his distinguished guest in\nperson, and, pleading his age and the one hundred and seventy-five\nEnglish miles he had ridden from Monterey, begged him as a younger man\nto waive informality, and dine at the house of the Commandante that\nvery day.  Rezanov had complied as a matter of course, and now he was\nalone with the men who held his fate in their hands. The dark worn\nrugged face of Don Jose, who had been skilfully prepared by his oldest\ndaughter to think well of the Russian, beamed with good-will and\ninterest, in spite of lingering doubts; but the lank, wiry figure of\nthe Governor, who was as dignified as only a blond Spaniard can be, was\nfairly rigid with the severe formality he reserved for occasions of\nceremony--being a gentleman who loved good company and cheer--and his\nsharp gray eyes were almost shut in the effort to penetrate the designs\nof this deputy, this symbol, this index in cipher, of a dreaded race.\nRezanov smoked calmly, made himself comfortable on the slippery\nhorse-hair chair, though with no loss of dignity, and beat about the\nbush with the others until the Governor betrayed himself at last by a\nchance remark:\n\n\"What you say of the neighborly instincts of the Russian colonists for\nthe Spanish on this coast interests me deeply, Excellency, but if\nRussia is at war with Spain--\"\n\n\"Russia is not at war with Spain,\" said Rezanov, with a flash of\namusement in his half-closed eyes. \"Napoleon Bonaparte is encamped\nabout half way between the two countries.  They could not get at each\nother if they wished.  While that man is at large, Europe will be at\nwar with him, no two nations with each other.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Arrillaga.  \"That is a manner of reasoning that had not\noccurred to me.\"\n\nThe Commandante had spat at the mention of the usurper's name and\nmuttered \"Chinchosa!\" and Rezanov, recalling his first conversation\nwith Concha, looked into the honest eyes of the monarchist with a\ndirect and hearty sympathy.\n\n\"No better epithet for him,\" he said.  \"And the sooner Europe combines\nto get rid of him the better.  But until it does, count upon a common\ngrievance to unite your country and mine.\"\n\n\"Good!\" muttered the Governor.  \"Good!  I am glad that nightmare has\nlifted its bat's wings from our poor California.  Captain O'Cain's raid\ntwo years ago made me apprehensive, for he took away some eleven\nhundred of our otter skins and his hunters were Aleutians--subjects of\nthe Tsar.  A negro that deserted gave the information that they were\nfurnished the Bostonian by the chief manager of your\nCompany--Baranhov--whose reputation we know well enough!--for the\ndeliberate purpose of raiding our coast.\"\n\nRezanov shrugged his shoulders and replied indifferently: \"I will ask\nBaranhov when I return to Sitka, and write you the particulars.  It is\nmore likely that the Aleutians were deserters.  This O'Cain would not\nbe the first shrewd Bostonian to tempt them, for they are admirable\nhunters and ready for any change.  They make a greater demand upon the\nCompany for variety of diet than we are always prepared to meet, so\nmany are the difficulties of transportation across Siberia.  When,\ntherefore, the time arrived that I could continue my voyage, I\ndetermined to come here and see if some arrangement could not be made\nfor a bi-yearly exchange of commodities.  We need farinaceous stuffs of\nevery sort.  I will not pay so poor a compliment to your knowledge of\nthe northern settlements as to enlarge upon the advantages California\nwould reap from such a treaty.\"\n\nThe Governor, who had permitted himself to touch the back of his chair\nafter the dispersal of the war cloud, stiffened again.  \"Ah!\" he said.\n\"Ah!\"  He looked significantly at the Commandante, who nodded.  \"You\ncome on a semi-official mission, after all, then?\"\n\n\"It is entirely my own idea,\" said Rezanov carelessly.  \"The young Tsar\nis too much occupied with Bonaparte to give more than a passing thought\nto his colonies.  But I have a free hand.  Can I arrange the\npreliminaries of a treaty, I have only to return to St. Petersburg to\nreceive his signature and highest approval.  It would be a great\nfeather in my cap I can assure your excellencies,\" he added, with a\nquick human glance and a sudden curve of his somewhat cynical mouth.\n\n\"Um!\" said the Governor.  \"Um!\"\n\nBut Arguello's stern face had further relaxed. After all, he was but\neleven years older than the Russian, and, although early struggles and\nheavy responsibilities and many disappointments had deprived life of\nmuch of its early savor, what was left of youth in him responded to the\nambition he divined in this interesting stranger.  Moreover, the idea\nof a friendly bond with another race on the lonely coast of the Pacific\nappealed to him irresistibly.  He turned eagerly to the Governor.\n\n\"It is a fine idea, Excellency.  We need much that they have, and it\npleases me to think we should be able to supply the wants of others.\nFancy any one wanting aught of California, except hides, to be sure.  I\ndid not think our existence was known save to an occasional British or\nBoston skipper.  It is true we are here only to Christianize savages,\nbut even they have need of much that cannot be manufactured in this\nGod-forsaken land.  And we ourselves could be more comfortable--God in\nheaven, yes!  It is well to think it over, Excellency.  Who knows?--we\nmight have a trip to the north once in a while.  Life is more excellent\nwith something to look forward to.\"\n\n\"You should have a royal welcome.  Baranhov is the most hospitable man\nin Russia, and I might have the happiness to be there myself.  I see,\nby the way, that you have not engaged in shipbuilding.  I need not say\nthat we should supply the ships of commerce, with no diminution of your\nprofits.  We build at Okhotsk, Petropaulovski, Kadiak, and Sitka.\nMoreover, as the Bostonians visit us frequently, and as your laws\nprohibit you from trading with them, we would see that you always got\nsuch of their commodities as you needed.  They come to us for furs, and\ngenerally bring much for which we have no use.  Captain D'Wolf, from\nwhom I bought the Juno, had a cargo I was forced to take over.  I\nunloaded what was needed at Sitka, but as there was no boat going for\nsome months to the other islands, I brought the rest with me, and you\nare welcome to it, if in exchange you will ballast the Juno with\nsamples of your agricultural products; while the treaty is pending, I\ncan experiment in our colonies and make sure which are the most\nadaptable to the market.\n\n\"Um!\" said the Governor.  \"Um!\"\n\nRezanov did not remove his cool direct gaze from the snapping eyes\nopposite.\n\n\"I have not the least objection to making a trade that would fill my\npromuschleniki with joy; but that was by no means the first object of\nmy voyage; which was partly inspired by a desire to see as much of this\nglobe as a man may in one short life, partly to arrange a treaty that\nwould be of incalculable benefit to both colonies and greatly redound\nto my own glory.  I make no pretence of being disinterested.  I look\nforward to a career of ever increasing influence and power in St.\nPetersburg, and I wish to take back as many credits as possible.\"\n\n\"I understand, I understand!\"  The Governor rested his lame back once\nmore.  \"Your ambition is the more laudable, Excellency, since you have\nachieved so much already.  I am not one to balk the honest ambition of\nany man, particularly when he does me the honor to take me into his\nconfidence.  I like this suggested measure.  I like it much.  I believe\nit would redound to our mutual benefit and reputation.  Is it not so,\nJose?\"\n\nThe Commandante nodded vigorously.  \"I am sure of it!  I am sure of it!\nI like it--much, much.\"\n\n\"I will write at once to the Viceroy of Mexico and ask that he lay the\nmatter before the Cabinet and King.  Without that high authority we can\ndo nothing.  But I see no reason to doubt the issue when we, who know\nthe wants and needs of California, approve and desire.  We are doomed\nto failure in this unwieldy land of worthless savages, but it is the\nbusiness of the wretched servants of a glorious monarch to do the best\nthey can.\"\n\nRezanov had an inspiration.  \"You might remind the viceroy that Spain\nand the United States of America have been on the verge of war for\nyears, and suggest the benefit of an alliance with Russia in the case\nof the new country taking advantage of the situation in Europe to\nextend its western boundaries--\"\n\nArrillaga had bounced to his feet, his small eyes injected and blazing.\n\"Those damned Bostonians!\" he shouted.  \"I distrusted them years ago.\nThey have too much calculation in their bluntness.  They cheated us,\nsold us short, traded under my very nose, stole our otters, until I\nordered them never to drop an anchor in California waters again.  If\ntheir ridiculous upstart government dares to cast its eyes on\nCalifornia we shall know how to meet them--the sooner they march on\nMexico and lose their conceit the better.  How they do brag!  Faugh!\nIt is sickening.  I shall remember all you say, Excellency; and thank\nyou for the hint.\"\n\nRezanov rose, and the Commandante solemnly kissed him on either cheek.\n\"Governor Arrillaga is my guest, Excellency,\" he said.  \"I beg that you\nwill dine with us daily--unofficially--that you will regard California\nas your own kingdom, and come and go at your pleasure.  And my daughter\nbegs me to remind you and your young officers that there will be\ninformal dancing every night.\"\n\n\"So far so good,\" thought Rezanov, as he mounted his horse to return to\nthe Juno.  \"But what of my cargo?  I fancy there will be more\ndifficulty in that quarter.\"\n\n\n\nXV\n\nThe Chamberlain was in a towering bad humor. As he made his appearance\nat least two hours earlier than he was expected, he found the decks of\nthe Juno covered with the skins of sea-dogs, foxes, and birds.  He had\nheard Langsdorff go to his cabin later than usual the night before, and\nthat his pet aversion was the cause of a fresh grievance, but hastened\nthe eruption of his smouldering resentment toward life in general.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" he roared to the sailor on watch.  \"Clear them\noff--overboard, every one of them.  What are you staring at?\"\n\nThe sailor, who was a \"Bostonian,\" an inheritance with the ship, opened\nhis mouth in favor of the unfortunate professor, but like his mates, he\nstood in much awe of a master whose indulgence demanded implicit\nobedience in return.  Without further ado, he flung the skins into the\nsea.\n\nRezanov, to do him justice, would not have acted otherwise had he risen\nin the best of tempers.  He had inflicted himself with the society of\nthe learned doctor that he might always have a physician and surgeon at\nhand, as well as an interpreter where Latin was the one door of\ncommunication.  He should pay him handsomely, make him a present in\naddition to the sum agreed upon, but he had not the least intention of\ngiving up any of the Juno's precious space to the vagaries of a\nscientist, nor to submit to the pollution of her atmosphere.\nLangsdorff was his creature, and the sooner he realized the fact the\nbetter.\n\n\"Remember,\" he said to the sailor, \"no more of this, or it will be the\nworse for you--  What is this?\"  He had come upon a pile of ducks,\ngulls, pelicans, and other aquatic birds.  \"Are these the cook's or the\nprofessor's?\"\n\n\"The professor's, Excellency.\"\n\n\"Overboard.\"  And the birds followed the skins.\n\nRezanov turned to confront the white and trembling Langsdorff.  The\nnaturalist was enfolded in a gorgeous Japanese dressing-gown, purple\nbrocade embroidered with gold, that he had surreptitiously bought in\nthe harbor of Nagasaki.  To Rezanov it was like a red rag to a bull;\nbut the professor was oblivious at the moment of the tactless garment.\nHis eyes were glaring and the extended tip of his nose worked like a\nknife trying to leap from its sheath.  But although he occasionally\nventured upon a retort when goaded too far in conversation, he was able\nto curb his just indignation when the Chamberlain was in a bad temper.\nIn that vague gray under winking stars in their last watch, Rezanov\nseemed to tower six feet above him.\n\n\"Excellency,\" he murmured.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"My--my specimens.\"\n\n\"Your what?\"\n\n\"The cause of science is very dear to me, Excellency.\"\n\n\"So it is to me--in its proper place.  Were those skins yours?\"  His\nvoice became very suave.  \"I am sorry you should have fatigued yourself\nfor nothing, but I am forced to remind you that this is not an\nexpedition undertaken for the promotion of natural history.  I am not\nviolating my part in the contract, I believe.  Upon our arrival at\nSitka you are at liberty to remain as my guest and make use of the\nfirst boat that sails for this colony; but for the present I beg that\nyou will limit yourself to the requirements of your position on my\nstaff.\"\n\nHe turned his back and ordered a canoe to be lowered.  Since the\narrival of the Governor and Commandante, now three days ago, all\nrestrictions on his liberty had been removed, and the phrases of\nhospitality were a trifle less meaningless.  He had been asked to give\nhis word to keep away from the fortifications, and as he knew quite as\nmuch of the military resources of the country as he desired, he had\nmerely suppressed a smile and given his promise.\n\nThis morning he wanted nothing but a walk.  He had slept badly, the\nblood was in his head, his nerves were on edge.  He went rapidly along\nthe beach and over the steep hills that led to the north-eastern point\nof the peninsula.  But he had taken the walk before and did not turn\nhis head to look at the great natural amphitheater formed by the inner\nslopes of those barren heights, so uninteresting of outline from the\nwater.  Once when Luis had left him to go down with an order to the\nBattery of Yerba Buena, he had examined it critically and concluded\nthat never had there been so fine a site for a great city.  Nor a more\nbeautiful, with the broken line of the San Bruno mountains in the\ndistance and a glimpse of the Mission valley just beyond this vast\ncolosseum, whose steep imposing lines were destined by nature to be set\nwith palaces and bazaars, minarets and towers and churches, with a\nthousand gilded domes and slender crosses glittering in the crystal air\nand sunlight.  If not another Moscow, then an Irkutsk in his day, at\nleast.\n\nBut he did not give the chosen site of his city a glance to-day,\nalthough in this gray air before dawn when mystery and imagination most\nclosely embrace, he might at another time have forgotten himself in one\nof those fits of dreaming that slipped him out of touch with realities,\nand sometimes precipitated action in a manner highly gratifying to his\nenemies.\n\nBut much as he loved Russia, there were times when he loved his own way\nmore, and since the arrival of Governor Arrillaga he was beginning to\nfeel as he had felt in the harbor of Nagasaki.  Not a word since that\nfirst interview had been said of his cargo; nor even of the treaty,\nalthough nothing could have been more natural than the discussion of\ndetails.  Whenever he had delicately broached either subject, he had\nbeen met with a polite indifference, that had little in common with the\ncordiality otherwise shown him.  He foresaw that he might be obliged to\nreveal the more pressing object of his visit without further diplomacy,\nand the thought irritated him beyond endurance.\n\nWhether Concha were giving him her promised aid he had no means of\ndiscovering, and herein lay another cause of his general vexation.  He\nhad dined every day at the Commandante's, danced there every night.\nConcha had been vivacious, friendly--impersonal.  Not so much as a\ncoquettish lift of the brow betrayed that the distinguished stranger\neclipsed the caballeros for the moment; nor a whispered word that he\nretained the friendship she had offered him on the day of their\nmeeting. He had not, indeed, had a word with her alone. But his\ninterest and admiration had deepened.  It was evident that her father\nand the Governor adored her, would deny her little.  Her attitude to\nthem was alternately that of the petted child and the chosen companion.\nAs her mother was indisposed, she occupied her place at the table,\npresiding with dignity, guiding the conversation, revealing the rare\ngift of making everyone appear at his best.  In the evening she had\nsometimes danced alone for a few moments, but more often with her\nRussian guests, and readily learning the English country dances they\nwere anxious to teach.  Rezanov would have found the gay informality of\nthese evenings delightful had his mind been at ease about his Sitkans,\nand Concha a trifle more personal.  He had begun by suspecting that she\nwas maneuvering for his scalp, but he was forced to acquit her; for not\nonly did she show no provocative favor to another, but she seemed to\nhave gained in dignity and pride since his arrival, actually to have\nkissed her hand in farewell to the childhood he had been so slow in\ndivining; grown--he felt rather than analyzed--above the pettiness of\ncoquetry.  Once more she had stirred the dormant ideals of his early\nmanhood; there were moments when she floated before his inner vision as\nthe embodiment of the world's beauty. Nor ever had there been a woman\nborn more elaborately equipped for the position of a public man's mate;\nnor more ingenerate, perhaps, with the power to turn earth into heaven.\n\nHe had wondered humorously if he were fallen in love, but, although he\nretained little faith in the activities of the heart after youth, he\nwas beginning seriously to consider the expedience of marrying Concha\nArguello.  He had not intended to marry again, and it was this old and\npassionate love of personal freedom that alone held him back, for\nnothing would be so advantageous to the Russian colonies in their\npresent crisis as a strong individual alliance with California.  Concha\nArguello was the famous daughter of its first subject, and with the\npowerful friends she would bring to her husband, the consummation of\nends dearer to his heart than aught on earth would be a matter of\nmonths instead of years.  And he thrilled with pride as he thought of\nConcha in St. Petersburg.  Two years of court life and she would be one\nof the greatest ladies in Europe.  That he could win her he believed,\nand without undue vanity.  He had much to offer an ambitious girl\nconscious of her superiority to the men of this province of Spain, and\nchafing at the prospect of a lifetime in a bountiful desert.  His only\nhesitation lay in his own doubt if she were worth the loss of his\nfreedom, and all that word involved to a man of his position and\nadventurous spirit.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders at this argument; he had walked off some of\nhis ill-humor, and reverted willingly to a theme that alone had given\nhim satisfaction during the past few days.  At the same time he made a\nmotion as if flinging aside an old burden.\n\n\"It is time for such nonsense to end,\" he thought contemptuously.  \"And\nin truth these three years should have wrought such changes in me I\ndoubt I should have patience for an hour of the old trifling. My\ngreatest need from this time on, I fancy, is work.  I could never be\nidle a month again.  And when a man is in love with work--and\npower--and has passed forty--does he want a constant companion?  That\nis the point.  At my time of life power exercises the most irresistible\nand lasting of all fascinations.  A man that wins it has little left\nfor a woman.\"\n\nHe had reached the summit of the rocky outpost; the highest of the\nhills where the peninsula turned abruptly to the south, and,\nscrupulously refraining from a downward glance at the Battery of Yerba\nBuena, stood looking out over the bay to the eastern mountains: dark,\nalmost formless, wrapped in the intense and menacing mystery of that\nlast hour before dawn.\n\n\"Senor!\" called a low cautious voice.\n\nRezanov stepped hastily back from the point of the bluff and glanced\nabout in wonder, his pulses suddenly astir.  But he could see no one.\n\nThis time the direction was unmistakable, and he went to the edge of\nthe plateau facing the south and looked over.  Halfway down a shallow\nand almost perpendicular gully, he saw a girl forcing a mustang up the\nharsh, loose path.  The girl's white and oval face looked from the\nfolds of a black reboso like the moon emerging from clouds, and its\nyoung beauty was out of place in that wild and forbidding setting.  She\nreined in her horse as she caught his eye and beckoned superfluously;\nthen guided her mustang to a little ledge where he could plant his feet\nfirmly, permitting her to reassume her usual pride of carriage and\naverting the danger of a sudden scramble or need of assistance.\n\nAs Rezanov reached her side, she gave him a grave and friendly smile,\nbut no opportunity to kiss her hand.\n\n\"I have followed your excellency,\" she said.  \"I saw you leave the\nJuno, and as I am often up at this hour, and as no one else ever is, my\nfather ignores the fact that I sometimes ride alone.  I have never come\nas far as this before, but there is something I wish to say to you, and\nthere is no opportunity at home.  I asked Santiago to find me one last\nnight, but he was in a bad temper and would not.  Men!  However--I\nsuppose you have heard nothing of the cargo?\"\n\n\"I have not,\" said Rezanov grimly, although acutely sensible that the\nsubject suited neither his mood nor the hour.\n\n\"But the Governor has!  Madre de Dios! all the women of the Presidio\nand the Mission have pestered him.  They are sick with jealousy at the\nshawls you gave us that day--those that did not go to the ship.  How\nclever of your excellency to give us just enough for ourselves and\nnothing for our friends!  And those that went want more and more. They\nhave called upon him--one, two, four, and alone.  They have wept and\nscolded and pleaded.  I did not know until yesterday that your\ncommissary had also shown the things to the priests from San\nJose--Father Jose Uria and Father Pedro de la Cueva.  They and the\npriests of San Francisco have argued with the Governor not once but\nthree times. Dios! how his poor excellency swore yesterday.  He\nthreatened to return at once to Monterey.  I flew into a great rage and\nthreatened in turn to follow with all the other girls and all the\npriests--vowed he should not have one moment of peace until that cargo\nwas ours.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked Rezanov sharply, in spite of his amusement.\n\nConcha shook her head.  \"When he does not swear, he answers only: 'Buy\nif you have the money.  I have never broken a law of Spain, and I shall\nnot begin in my old age.'  He knows well that we have no money to send\nout of New Spain; but I have conceived a plan, senor.  It is for you,\nnot for me, to suggest it.  You will never betray that I have been your\nfriend, Excellency?\"\n\n\"I will swear it if you wish,\" said Rezanov frigidly.\n\n\"Pardon, senor.  If I thought you could I should not be here.  One\noften says such things.  This is the plan: You shall suggest that we\nbuy your wares, and that you buy again with our money.  The dear\nGovernor only wants to save his conscience an ache, for we have driven\nhim nearly distracted.  I am sure he will consent, for you will know\nhow to put it to him very diplomatically.\"\n\n\"But if he refused to understand, or his conscience remained obdurate?\nI should then have neither cargo nor ballast.\"\n\n\"He would never trick a guest, nor would he let the money go out of the\ncountry.  And he knows well how much we need your cargo and longs to be\nable to state in his reports that he sold you a hold full of\nbreadstuffs.  Moreover, I think the time has come to tell him of the\ndistress at Sitka.  He is very soft-hearted and is now in that\ndistracted state of mind when only one more argument is required.  I\nhope I have given you good advice, Excellency.  It is the best I can\nthink of.  I have given it much thought, and the terrible state of\nthose miserable creatures has kept me awake many nights.  I must return\nnow.  Will your excellency kindly remain here until I am well on my\nway?--and then return by the beach?  I shall go as I came, through the\nvalley.  Neither of us can be seen from the Battery.\"\n\n\"I will obey all your instructions,\" said Rezanov. But he did not move,\nnor could the mustang.  Concha smiled and pointed to the other side of\nthe cleft, which was about as wide as a narrow street.\n\n\"Pardon, senor, I cannot turn.\"\n\nFor a moment Rezanov stared at her, through her.  Then his heavy eyes\nopened and flashed.  It seemed to him that for the first time he saw\nhow beautiful, how desirable she was, set in that gray volcanic rock\nwith the heavens gray above her, and the stars fading out.  It was not\nthe bower he would have imagined for the wooing of a mate, but neither\nmoonlight nor the romantic glades of La Bellissima could have awakened\nin him a passion so sudden and final.  Her face between the black folds\nturned whiter and she shrank back against the jagged wall: and when his\neyes flashed again with a wild eager hope she involuntarily crossed\nherself.  He threw himself against the horse and snatched her down and\nkissed her as he had kissed no woman yet, recognizing her once for all.\n\nWhen he finally held her at arm's length for a moment he laughed\nconfusedly.\n\n\"The Russian bear is no longer a figure of speech,\" he said.  \"Forgive\nme.  I forgot that you are as tender as you are strong.\"\n\nHer hands were tightly clasped against her breast and the breath was\nshort in her throat, but she made no protest.  Her eyes were radiant,\nher mouth was the only color in that gray dawn.  In a moment she too\nlaughed.\n\n\"Dios de mi alma!  What will they say?  A heretic!  If Tamalpais fell\ninto the sea it would not make so great a sensation in this California\nof ours where civilized man exists but to drive heathen souls into the\none true church.\"\n\n\"Will it matter to you?  Are you strong enough? It will be only a\nquestion of time to win them over, if you are.\"\n\nShe nodded emphatically.  \"I was born with strength.  Now--Dios!--now I\ncan be stronger than the King of Spain himself, than the Governor, my\nparents and all the priests--  You would not become a Catholic?\" she\nasked abruptly.\n\nHe shook his head, although he still smiled at her. \"Not even for you.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said thoughtfully.  \"I will confess--what matters it?--I\noften dreamed that this would come just because I believed it would\nnot.  But why should one control the imagination when it alone can give\nus happiness for a little while?  I gave it rein, for I thought that\none-half of my life was to be passed in that unreal but by no means\nniggardly world.  And I thought of everything.  To change your religion\nwould mean the ruin of your career; moreover, it is not a possibility\nof your character. Were it I think I should not love you so much.  Nor\ncould I bear to think of any change in you.  Only it will be\nharder--longer.\"  Then she stretched out her hand, and closed and\nopened it slowly.  The most obtuse could not have failed to read the\nold simile of the steel in the velvet.  \"I shall win because it is my\nnature--and my power--to hold what I grasp.\"\n\n\"But if they persistently refuse--\"\n\n\"Dios!\" she interrupted him.  \"Do you think that your love is greater\nthan mine?  I was born with a thousand years of love in me and had you\nnot come I should have gone alone with my dreams to the grave.  I am\nall women in one, not merely Concha Arguello, a girl of sixteen.\"  She\nclasped her hands high above her head, lifting her eyes to the ashen\nvault so soon to yield to the gay brush of dawn.\n\n\"Before all that great mystery,\" she said solemnly, \"I give myself to\nyou forever, how much or how little that may mean here on earth.\nForever.\"\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nThe Commandante of the San Francisco Company sat opposite Rezanov with\nhis mouth open, the lines of his strong face elongated and relaxed.  It\nwas the hour of siesta, and they were alone in the sala.\n\n\"Mother of God!\" he exclaimed.  \"Mother of God!  Are you mad,\nExcellency?\"\n\n\"No man was ever saner,\" said Rezanov cheerfully.  \"What better proof\nwould you have than this final testimony to Dona Concha's perfections?\"\n\n\"But it cannot be!  Surely, Excellency, you realize that?  The priests!\nAy yi!  Ay yi!\"\n\n\"I think I understand the priests.  Persuade the Governor to buy my\ncargo and they will look upon me as an amicus humani generis to whom\ncommon rules do not apply.  And I have won their sincere friendship.\"\n\n\"You have won mine, senor.  But, though I say it, there is no more\ndevout Catholic in the Californias than Jose Arguello.  Do you know\nwhat they call me?  El santo.  God knows I am not, but it is not for\nwant of the wish.  Did I give my daughter to a heretic, not only should\nI become an outcast, a pariah, but I should imperil my everlasting soul\nand that of my best beloved child.  It is impossible,\nExcellency--unless, indeed, you embrace our faith.\"\n\n\"That is so impossible that the subject is not worth the waste of a\nmoment.  But surely, Commandante, in your excitement at this perfectly\nnatural issue you are misrepresenting yourself.  I do not believe,\ndevout Catholic as you are, that your soul is steeped in fanaticism.\nYou are known far and wide as the first and most intelligent of His\nCatholic Majesty's subjects in New Spain.  When you have my word of\nhonor that your daughter's faith shall never be disturbed, it is\nimpossible you should believe that marriage with me would ruin her\nchances of happiness in the next world.  But I doubt if your soul and\nconscience will have the peace you desire if you ruin her happiness in\nthis.  What pleasure do you find in the thought of an old age\ncompanioned by a heart-broken daughter?\"\n\nDon Jose turned pale and hitched his chair. \"Other maids have been\nbalked when young, and have forgotten.  Concha is but sixteen--\"\n\n\"She is also unique.  She will marry me or no one.  Of that I am as\ncertain as that she is the woman of women for me.\"\n\n\"How can you be so certain?\" asked the Commandante sharply.  \"Surely\nyou have had little talk alone with her?\"\n\n\"The heart has a language of its own.  Recall your own youth, senor.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" said Don Jose, with a heavy sigh, as he had a fleeting\nvision of Dona Ignacia, slim and lovely, at the grating, with a rose in\nher hair.  \"But this tremendous passion of the heart--it passes, senor,\nit passes.  We love the good wife, but we sometimes realize that we\ncould have loved another good wife as well.\"\n\n\"That is a bit of philosophy I should have uttered myself,\nCommandante--yesterday.  But there are women and women, and your\ndaughter is one of the chosen few who take from the years what the\nyears take from others.  I am not rushing into matrimony for the sake\nof a pair of black eyes and a fine figure.  I have outlived the\npossibility of making a fool of myself if I would.  Before I realized\nhow deeply I loved your daughter I had deliberately chosen her out of\nall the women I have known, as my friend and companion for the various\nand difficult ways of life which I shall be called upon to follow.\nYour daughter will have a high place at the Russian Court, and she will\noccupy it as naturally as if I had found her in Madrid and you in the\ngreat position to which your attainments and services entitle you.\"\n\nDon Jose, despite his consternation, titillated agreeably.  He\nprivately thought no one in New Spain good enough for his daughter, and\nhis weather-beaten self was not yet insensible to the rare visitation\nof winged darts tipped with honey. But the situation was one of the\nmost embarrassing he had ever been called upon to face, and perhaps for\nthe first time in his direct and honest life his resolution was shaken\nin a crisis.\n\n\"Believe me, your excellency, I appreciate the honor you have done my\nhouse, and I will add with all my heart that never have I liked a man\nmore. But--Mother of God!  Mother of God!\"\n\nRezanov took out his cigarette case, a superb bit of Russian enamel,\ngraven with the Imperial arms, and a parting gift from his Tsar.  He\npassed it to his host, who had developed a preference for Russian\ncigarettes.\n\n\"There are other things to consider besides the happiness of your\ndaughter and myself,\" he remarked.  \"This alliance would mean the\nconsolidation of Spanish and Russian interests on the Pacific coast.\nIt would mean the protection of California in the almost certain event\nof 'American' aggression.  And I hear that a courier brought word again\nyesterday that the Russian and the Spanish fleets had sailed for these\nwaters.  I do not believe a word of it; but should it be true, I would\nremind you of two things: that I have the powers of the Tsar himself in\nthis part of the world, and that the Russian fleet is likely to arrive\nfirst.\"\n\nAgain the Commandante moved uneasily.  The news from Mexico had kept\nhimself and the Governor awake the better part of the night.  He fully\nappreciated the importance of this powerful Russian's friendship.\nNothing would bind and commit him like taking a Californian to wife.\nIf only he had fallen in love with Carolina Xime'no or Delfina Rivera!\nDon Jose had an uneasy suspicion that his scruples as a Catholic might\nhave gone down before his sense of duty to this poor California.  But a\nheretic in his own family!  He was justly renowned for his piety.\nAside from the wrath of the church, the mere thought of one of his\noffspring in matrimonial community beyond its pale made him sick with\nrepugnance.  And yet--California!  And he would have selected Rezanov\nfor his daughter out of all men had he been of their faith.  And he was\ndeeply conscious of the honor that had descended, however unfruitfully,\nupon his house.  Madre de Dios!  How would it end?  Suddenly he felt\nhimself inspired.  In blissful ignorance of her subtle feminine rule,\nhe reminded himself that Concha's mind was the child of his own.  When\nshe saw his embarrassment, filial duty and woman's wit would extricate\nthem both with grace and avert the enmity of the Russian even though\nthe latter's more personal interest in California must die in his\ndisappointment.  He would make her feel the weight of the stern\npaternal hand, and then indicate the part she had to play.\n\nHe rang a bell and directed the servant to summon his daughter, drew\nhimself up to his full height, and set his rugged face in hard lines.\nAs Concha entered he looked the Commandante, the stern disciplinarian,\nevery inch of him.\n\nThere was no trace of the siesta in Concha's cheeks.  They were very\nwhite, but her eyes were steady and her mouth indomitable as she walked\ndown the sala and took the chair Rezanov placed for her.  Except for\nher Castilian fairness, she looked very like the martinet sitting on\nthe other side of the table.  The Commandante regarded her silently\nwith brows drawn together.  Dimly, he felt apprehension, wondered, in a\nflash of insight, if girls held fast to the parental recipe, or\nrecombined with tongue in cheek.  The bare possibility of resistance\nalmost threw him into panic, but he controlled his features until the\neffort injected his eyes and drew in his nostrils.  Concha regarded him\ncalmly, although her heart beat unevenly, for she dreaded the long\nstrain she foresaw.\n\n\"My daughter,\" said Don Jose finally, his tones harsh with repressed\nmisgiving, \"do you suspect why I have sent for you?\"\n\n\"I think that his excellency wishes to marry me,\" replied Concha; and\nthe Commandante was so staggered by the calm assurance of her tone and\nmanner that his pent-up emotion exploded.\n\n\"Dios!\" he roared.  \"What right have you to know when a man wishes to\nmarry you?  What manner of Spanish girl is this?  Truly has his\nexcellency said that you are not as other women.  The place for you is\nyour room, with bread and water for a week.  Sixteen!\"\n\n\"Ignacio was born when my mother was sixteen,\" said Concha coolly.\n\n\"What of that?  She married whom and when she was told to marry.\"\n\n\"I have heard that you serenaded nightly beneath her grating--\"\n\n\"So did others.\"\n\n\"I have heard that when of all her suitors her father chose one more\nhighly born, a gentleman of the Viceroy's court, she pined until they\ngave their consent to her marriage with you, lest she die.\"\n\n\"But I was a Catholic!  The prejudice against my birth was an unworthy\none.  I had distinguished myself.  And she had the support of the\npriests.\"\n\n\"It is my misfortune that M. de Rezanov is not a Catholic, but it will\nmake no difference.  I shall not fall ill, for I am like you, not like\nmy dear mother--and the education you have given me is very different\nfrom hers.  But I shall marry his excellency or no one, and whether I\nmarry him or live alone with the thought of him until the end of my\nmortal days, I do not believe that my soul will be imperilled in the\nleast.\"\n\n\"You do not!\" shouted the irate Spaniard.  \"How dare you presume to\ndecide such a question for yourself?  What does a woman know of love\nuntil she marries?  It is nothing but a sickening imagination before;\nand if the man goes, the doctor soon comes.\"\n\n\"You may not have intended--but you have taught me to think for myself.\nAnd I have seen others besides M. de Rezanov--the flower of California\nand more than one fine gentleman from Mexico.  I will have none of\nthem.  I will marry the man of my choice or no one.  It may be that I\nknow naught of love.  If you wish, you may think that my choice of a\nhusband is determined by ambition, that I am dazzled with the thought\nof court life in St. Petersburg, of being the consort of a great and\nwealthy noble.  It matters not.  Love or ambition, I shall marry this\nRussian or I shall never marry at all.\"\n\n\"Mother of God!  Mother of God!\"  Don Jose's face was purple.  The\nveins swelled in his neck.  He was the more wroth because he recognized\nhis own daughter and his own handiwork, because he saw that he\nconfronted a Toledo blade, not a woman's brittle will.  Concha regarded\nhim calmly.\n\n\"If you refuse your consent you will lose me in another way.  I may not\nbe able to marry as I wish, but I will have no worldly alternative.  I\nshall join the Third Order of the Franciscans, and enter a convent as\nsoon as one is built in California.  To that you cannot withhold your\nconsent, or they no longer would call you El santo.\"\n\nDon Jose leaped from his chair.  \"Go to your room!\" he thundered.  \"And\ndo not dare to leave it without my permission--\"\n\nBut Concha sprang forward and flung herself upon his neck.  She rubbed\nher warm elastic cheek against his own in the manner he loved, and\nsoftened her voice.  \"Papacito mio, papacito mio,\" she pleaded.  \"Thou\nwilt not refuse thy Concha the only thing she has ever begged of thee.\nAnd I beg!  I beg!  Papa mio!  I love him!  I love him!\"  And she broke\ninto wild weeping and kissed him frantically, while Rezanov who had\nfollowed her plan of attack and resistance in silent admiration, did\nnot know whether he should himself be moved to tears or further admire.\n\nDon Jose pushed her from him with a heavy sob and hastily left the\nroom, oblivious in the confusion of his faculties of the boon he\nconferred on the lovers.  Concha dried her eyes, but her face was\ndeathly pale.  It had not been all acting, by any means, and she was\nbeginning to feel the tyranny of sleepless nights; and the joy and\nwonder of the morning had left her with but a remnant of endurance for\nthe domestic battleground.\n\n\"Go,\" she whispered, as he took her in his arms. \"Return for the dance\nto-night as if nothing had happened--  I forgot, there is to be a\nbull-bear fight in the square.  So much the better, for it is in your\nhonor, and you could not well remain away. There is much trouble to\ncome, but in the end we shall win.\"\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nThe muscles in Dona Ignacia's cheeks fell an inch as she listened,\ndumbfounded, to the tale her husband poured out.  To her simple\naristocratic soul Rezanov had loomed too great a personage to dream of\nmating with a Californian; and as her sharp maternal instinct had\nrecognized his personal probity, even his gallantries had seemed to her\nno more consequent than the more catholic trifling of his officers.\n\n\"Holy Mary!\" she whimpered, when her voice came back.  \"Holy Mary!  A\nheretic!  And he would take our Concha from us!  And she would go!  To\nSt. Petersburg!  Ten thousand miles! To the priests with her--now--this\nvery day!\"\n\nConcha had thrown herself on her bed in belated hope of siesta, when\nMalia (Rosa had been sent to the house of Don Mario Sal in the valley)\nentered with the message that she was to accompany her parents to the\nMission at once.  She rose sullenly, but in the manifold essentials of\na girl's life she had always yielded the implicit obedience exacted by\nthe Californian parent.  In a few moments she was riding out of the\nPresidio beside her father. Dona Ignacia jolted behind in her carreta,\na low and clumsy vehicle, on solid wheels and springless, drawn by\noxen, and driven by a stable-boy on a mustang.  The journey was made in\ncomplete silence save for the maledictions addressed to the oxen by the\nboy, and an occasional \"Ay yi!\"  \"Madre de Dios!\"  \"Sainted Mary, but\nthe sun bores a hole in the head,\" from Dona Ignacia, whose increasing\ndiscomfort banished wrath and apprehension for the hour.\n\nDon Jose did not even look at his daughter, but his face was ten years\nolder than in the morning. He had begun dimly to appreciate that she\nwas suffering, and in a manner vastly different from the passionate\nresentment he had seen her display when the contents of a box from\nMexico disappointed her, or she was denied a visit to Monterey.  That\nhis best-loved child should suffer tore his own heart, but he merely\ncursed Rezanov and resolved to do his best to persuade the Governor to\nyield to his other demands, that California might be rid of him the\nsooner.\n\nFather Abella was walking down the long outer corridor of the Mission\nreading his breviary, and praying he might not be diverted from\nrighteousness by the comforting touch of his new habit, when he looked\nup and saw the party from the presidio floundering over the last of the\nsand hills.  He shuffled off to order refreshments, and returned in\ntime to disburden the carreta of Dona Ignacia--no mean feat--volubly\ndelighted in the visit and the gossip it portended.  But as he offered\nhis arm to lead her into the sala, she pushed him aside and pointed to\nConcha, who had sprung to the ground unassisted.\n\n\"She has come to confess, padre!\" she exclaimed, her mind, under the\ndeep tiled roof of the corridor, readjusting itself to tragedy.  \"I beg\nthat you will take her at once.  Padre Landaeta can give us chocolate\nand we will tell our terrible news to him and receive advice and\nconsolation.\"\n\nFather Abella, not without a glimmering of the truth, for better than\nany one he understood the girl he had confessed many times, besides\nhimself having succumbed to the Russian, led the way to the\nconfessional in some perturbation of spirit.  He walked slowly, hoping\nthat the long, cool church, its narrow high windows admitting so scant\na meed of sunlight that no one of its worshippers had ever read the\nlegends on the walls, and even the stations were but deeper bits of\nshade, would attune her mind to holy things, and throw a mantle of\nunreality over those of the world.\n\nHe covered his face with his hand as she told her story.  This she did\nin a few words, disjointed, for she was both tired and seething.  For a\nfew moments afterward there was a silence; the good priest was\nincreasingly disturbed and by no means certain of his course.  He was\nastonished to feel a tug at his sleeve.  Before he could reprove this\nimpenitent child for audacity she had raised herself that she might\napproach her lips more closely to his ear.\n\n\"Mi padre!\" she whispered hoarsely, \"you will take my part!  You will\nnot condemn me to a life of misery!  I am too proud to speak openly to\nothers--but I love this man more than my soul--more than my immortal\nsoul.  Do you hear?  I am in danger of mortal sin.  Perhaps I am\nalready in that state.  You cannot save me if he goes.  I will not\npray.  I will not come to the church.  I will be an outcast.  If I\nmarry him, I will be a good Catholic to the end of my days.  If I marry\nhim I can think of other things besides--of my church, my father, my\nmother, my sisters, brothers.  If he goes, I shall pass my life\nthinking of nothing but him, and if it be true that heretics are doomed\nto hell, then I will live so that I may go to hell with him.\"\n\nIn spite of his horror the priest was thrilled by the intense passion\nin the voice so close to his ear. Moreover, he knew women well, this\ngood padre, for even in California they differed little from those that\nplayed ball with the world.  So he dismissed the horror and spoke\nsoothingly.\n\n\"What you have said would be mortal sin, my daughter, were it not that\nyou are laboring under strong and natural excitement; and I shall\nabsolve you freely when you have done the penance I must impose.  You\nhave always been such a good child that I am able to forgive you even\nin this terrible moment.  But, my daughter, surely you know that this\nmarriage can never take place--\"\n\n\"It shall!  It shall!\"\n\n\"Control yourself, my daughter.  You cannot bring this man into the\ntrue church.  His character is long since formed and cast--it is iron.\nEven love will not melt it.  Were he younger--\"\n\n\"I should hate him.  All young men are insufferable to me--always have\nbeen.  I have found my mate, and have him I will if I have to hide in\nthe hold of his ship.  Ah, padre mio, I know not what I say.  But you\nwill help me.  Only you can.  My father thinks you as wise as a saint.\nAnd there are other things--my head turns round--I can hardly\nthink--but you dare not lose the friendship of this Russian.  And my\nmarriage to him would be as much for the good of the Missions as for\nCalifornia herself.  Champion our course, point out that not only would\nit be a great match for me, but that many ends would be lost by ruining\nmy life. The Governor will find himself in a position to grant your\nprayers for the cargo, particularly if you first persuaded my\nfather--so long they have been friends, the Governor could not resist\nif he joined our forces.  What is one girl that she should be held of\ngreater account than the welfare of this country to which you are\ndevoting your life?  The happier are your converts, the more kindly\nwill they take to Christianity--which they do not love as yet!--the\nmore faithful and contented will they be, in the prospect of the\nluxuries and the toys and the trinkets of the Russian north.  What is\none girl against the friendship of Russia for Spain?  Who am I that I\nshould weigh a peseta in the scale?\"\n\n\"You are Concha Arguello, the flower of all the maidens in California,\nand the daughter of the best of our men,\" replied Father Abella\nmusingly.  \"And until to-day there has been no Catholic more devout--\"\n\n\"It lies with you, mi padre, whether I continue to be the best of\nCatholics or become the most abandoned of heretics.  You know me better\nthan anyone.  You know that I will not weaken and bend and submit, like\na thousand other women.  I could be bad--bad--bad--and I will be!  Do\nyou hear?\"  And she shook his arm violently, while her hoarse voice\nfilled the church.\n\n\"My child!  My child!  I have always believed that you had it in you to\nbecome a saint.  Yes, yes, I feel the strength and maturity of your\nnature, I know the lengths to which it might lead another; but you\ncould not be bad, Conchita.  I have known many women.  In you alone\nhave I perceived the capacity for spiritual exaltation.  You are the\nstuff of which saints and martyrs are made.  The violent will, the\ntranscendent passions--they have existed in the greatest of our saints,\nand been conquered.\"\n\n\"I will not conquer.  I--  Oh, padre--for the love of heaven--\"\n\nHe left the box hastily and lifted her where she had fallen and carried\nher into the room adjoining the church.  He laid her on the floor, and\nran for Dona Ignacia, who, refreshed with wine and chocolate, came\nswiftly.  But when Concha, under practical administrations and maternal\nendearments, finally opened her eyes, she pushed her mother coldly\naside, rose and steadied herself against the wall for a moment, then\nreturned to the church, closing the door behind her.\n\nWhen a woman has borne thirteen children in the lost corners of the\nworld, with scarce a thought in thirty years for aught else save the\nhusband and his comforts, it is not to be expected that her wits should\nbe rapiers or her vocabulary distinguished. But Dona Ignacia's\nunresting heart had an intelligence of its own, and no inner convulsion\ncould alter the superb dignity of mien which Nature had granted her.\nAs she rose and confronted Father Abella he moved forward with the\ninstinct to kiss her hand, as he had seen Rezanov do.\n\n\"Mi padre,\" she said, \"Concha is the first of my children to push me\naside, and it is like a blow on the heart; but I have neither anger nor\nresentment, for it was not the act of a child to its parent, but of one\nwoman to another.  Alas! this Russian, what has he done, when her own\nmother can give her no comfort?  We all love when young, but this is\nmore. I loved Jose so much I thought I should die when they would have\ncompelled me to marry another. But this is more.  She will not die, nor\neven go to bed and weep for days, but it is more.  I should not have\ndied, I know that now, and in time I should have married another, and\nbeen as happy as a woman can be when the man is kind.  Concha will love\nbut once, and she will suffer--suffer--  She may be more than I, but I\nbore her and I know.  And she cannot marry him.  A heretic!  I no\nlonger think of the terrible separation.  Were he a Catholic I should\nnot think of myself again.  But it cannot be.  Oh, padre, what shall we\ndo?\"\n\nThey talked for a long while, and after further consultation with Don\nJose and Father Landaeta, it was decided that Concha should remain for\nthe present in the house of Juan Moraga, where she could receive the\ndaily counsels of the priests, and be beyond the reach of Rezanov.\nMeanwhile, all influence would be brought to bear upon the Governor\nthat the Russian might be placated even while made to realize that to\nloiter longer in California waters would be but a waste of precious\ntime.\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nThere was no performance after all in the Presidio square that night,\nfor the bear brought in from the hills to do honor to the Russians died\nof excitement, and it rained besides.  Rezanov made the storm his\nexcuse for not dining and dancing as usual at the house of the\nCommandante.  But the relations between the Presidio and the Juno\nduring the next few days were by no means strained.  Davidov and\nKhostov were always with the Spanish officers, drinking and card\nplaying, or improving their dancing and Spanish with the girls, whose\nguitars were tuned for the waltz day and night.  The dignitaries met as\nusual and conversed on all topics save those paramount in the minds of\neach.  Nevertheless, there were three significant facts as well known\nto Rezanov as had they been aired to his liking.\n\nHe had sought an interview with Father Abella, and tactfully ignoring\nthe question of his marriage, had persuaded that astute and influential\npriest to make the proposition regarding his cargo that Concha had\nsuggested.  The priest, backed by his three coadjutors, had made it,\nand been repulsed with fury.  From another quarter Rezanov learned that\nduring his absence little else was discussed in the house of the\nCommandante save his formidable matrimonial project, and the supposed\ndesigns to his country.  Troops had been ordered from the south to\nreinforce the San Francisco garrisons, and were even now massed at\nSanta Clara, within a day's march of the bay.\n\nAbout a mile from the Presidio and almost opposite the Juno's anchorage\nwere six great stone tubs sunken in the ground and filled by a spring\nof clear water.  Here, once a week, the linen, fine and heavy, of Fort\nand Presidio was washed, the stoutest serving women of households and\nbarracks meeting at dawn and scrubbing for half a day. Rezanov had\nwatched the bright picture they made--for they wore a bit of every hue\nthey could command--with a lazy interest, which quickened to thirst\nwhen he heard that they were the most reliable newsmongers in the\ncountry.  In every Presidial district was a similar institution, and\nthe four were known as the \"Wash Tub Mail.\"  Many of the women were\nselected by the tyrants of the tubs for their comeliness, and each had\na lover in the couriers that went regularly with mail and official\ninstructions from one end of the Californias to the other.  All\nimportant news was known first by these women, and much was discussed\nover the tubs that was long in reaching higher but no less interested\ncircles; and domestic bulletins were as eagerly prized.  The sailor\nthat brought this information to Rezanov was a good-looking and\nsusceptible youth, already the victim of an Indian maiden from the\nhandsome tribe in the Santa Clara Valley, and sister of Dona Ignacia's\nMalia.  Rezanov furnished him with beads and other trinkets and was at\nno disadvantage thereafter.\n\nThere was nothing Rezanov would have liked better than to see a Russian\nfleet sail through the straits, but he also knew that nothing was less\nlikely, and that from such rumors he should only derive further\nannoyance and delay.  Two of his sailors deserted at the prospect of\nwar, and his hosts, if neutral, were manifestly alert.  Luis and\nSantiago had been obliged to go to Monterey for a few days, and there\nwas no one at the Presidio in whom Rezanov could confide either his\nimpatience to see Concha or at the adjournment of his more prosaic but\nno less pressing interests.  These two young men had been with him\nalmost constantly since his arrival, and demonstrated their friendship\nand even affection unfailingly; but there was no love lost between\nhimself and Gervasio.  This young hidalgo had the hauteur and intense\nfamily pride of Santiago without his younger brother's frank\nintelligence and lingering ingenuousness.  With all the superiority and\ninferiority, he had made himself so unpopular that his real kindness of\nheart atoned for his absurdities only with those that knew him best.\nRezanov was not one of these nor aspired to be. Like all highly\nseasoned men of the world, he had no patience with the small vanities\nof the provincial, and although diplomatically courteous to all, in his\npresent precarious position, he had taken too little trouble to\nconciliate Gervasio to find him of use in the absence of his friends.\n\nAt the end of three days Rezanov had forgotten his cargo, and would\nhave sent the Juno to the bottom for ten minutes alone with Concha.  He\nhad been on fire with love of her since the moment of his actual\nsurrender, and he was determined to have her if there were no other\nrecourse but elopement. All his old and intense love of personal\nfreedom had melted out of form in the crucible of his lover's\nimagination.  That he should have doubted for a moment that Concha was\nthe woman for whom his soul had held itself aloof and unshackled was a\nmatter for contemptuous wonder, and the pride he had taken in his keen\nand swift perceptive faculties suffered an eclipse.  Mind and soul and\nbody he was a lover, a union unknown before.\n\nOn the fourth morning, his patience at an end, he was about to leave\nthe Juno to demand a formal interview with Don Jose when he saw Luis\nand Santiago dismount at the beach and enter the canoe always in\nwaiting.  A few moments later they had helped themselves to cigarettes\nfrom the gift of the Tsar and were assuring Rezanov of their\npartisanship and approval.\n\n\"We were somewhat taken aback at the first moment,\" Luis admitted.\n\"But--well, we are both in love--Santiago no less than I, although I\nhave had these six long years of waiting and am likely to have another.\nAnd we love Concha as few men love their sisters, for there is no one\nlike her--is it not so, Rezanov?  And we quite understand why she has\nchosen you, and why she stands firm, for we know the strength of her\ncharacter.  We would that you were a Catholic, but even so, we will not\nsit by and see her life ruined, and we have called to assure you that\nwe shall use all our influence, every adroit argument, to bring our\nparents to a more reasonable frame of mind.  They have already risen\nabove the first natural impulse of selfishness, and would consent to\nthe inevitable separation were you only a Catholic.  I have also talked\nwith the Governor--we arrived at midnight--and he flew into a terrible\ntemper--the poor man is already like a mad bull at bay--but if my\nfather yielded, he would--on all points.  This morning I shall ride\nover and talk with Father Abella, who, I fancy, needs only a little\nextra pressure--you may be sure Concha has not been idle--to yield; and\nfor more reasons than one.  I shall enlist Father Uria and Father de la\nCueva as well.  They also have great influence with my parents, and as\nthey return to San Jose in two days to prepare for the visit of the\nmost estimable Dr. Langsdorff, there is no time to lose.  I shall go\nthis morning.  One more cigarito, senor, and when that treaty is drawn\nremember the conversion of your brother to Russian tobacco.\"\n\nRezanov thanked him so warmly, assured him with so convincing an\nemphasis that with his fate in such competent hands his mind was at\npeace, that the ardent heart of the Californian exulted; Rezanov, with\nhis splendid appearance, and typical of the highest civilizations of\nEurope, had descended upon his narrow sphere with the authority of a\ndemigod, and he not only thirsted to serve him, but to fasten him to\nCalifornia with the surest of human bonds.\n\nAs he dropped over the side of the ship, Rezanov's hand fell lightly on\nthe shoulder of Santiago.\n\n\"I can wait no longer to see your sister,\" he whispered, mindful of the\nsterner responsibilities of the older brother.  \"Do you think you\ncould--\"\n\nSantiago nodded.  \"While Luis is at the Mission I shall go to my cousin\nJuan Moraga's.  You will dine with us at the Presidio, and I shall\nescort you back to the ship.\"\n\n\n\nXIX\n\nIt was ten o'clock when Rezanov, who had supped on the Juno, met\nSantiago in a sandy valley half a mile from the Presidio and mounted\nthe horse his young friend himself had saddled and brought. The long\nride was a silent one.  The youth was not talkative at any time, and\nRezanov was conscious of little else save an overwhelming desire to see\nConcha again.  One secret of his success in life was his gift of\nyielding to one energy at a time, oblivious at the moment to aught that\nmight distract or enfeeble the will.  To-night, as he rode toward the\nMission on as romantic a quest as ever came the way of a lover, the\ndiplomat, the anxious director of a great Company, the representative\nof one of the mighty potentates of earth, were submerged, forgotten, in\nthe thrilling anticipation of his hour with the woman for whom every\nfiber of his being yearned.\n\nNor ever was there more appropriate a setting for one of those\ninaugural chapters in mating, half appreciated at the time, that\nglimmer as a sort of morning twilight on mountain tops over the mild\nundulations of matrimony.  The moon rode without a masking cloud across\nthe ambiguous night blue of the California sky, a blue that looks like\nthe fire of strange elements, where the stars glow like silver coals,\nand out of whose depths intense shadows of blue and black fall; shadows\nin which all the terrestrial world seems to float and recombine, where\nhouses are ghosts of ancient selves and men but the eidola of forgotten\ndust.  To-night the little estate of Juan Moraga, the most isolated and\neastern of the settlement, surrounded by its high white wall, looked as\nunreal and formless as the blue oval of water and black trees behind\nit, but Rezanov knew that it enfolded warm and palpitating womanhood\nand was steeped in the sweetness of Castilian roses.\n\nThe riders, who had taken a path far to the east of the Mission\ndismounted and tied their horses among the willows, then, in their dark\ncloaks but a part of the shadows, stole toward the wall designed to\nimpress hostile tribes rather than to resist onslaught; at the first\nwarning the settlement invariably fled to the church, where walls were\nmassive and windows high.\n\nIn three of Moraga's four walls was a grille, or wicket of slender iron\nbars, whence the open could be swept with glass, or gun at a pinch; and\ntoward the grille looking eastward went Rezanov as swiftly as the\nuneven ground would permit.  As Concha watched him gather form in the\nmoonlight and saw him jerk his cloak off impatiently, she flung her\nsoft body against the wall and shook the bars with her strong little\nhands.  But when he faced her she was erect and smiling; in a sudden\nuprush of spirits, almost indifferent.  She wore a white gown and a\nrose in her hair.  A rosebush as dense as an arbor spread its prickly\narms between herself and the windows of the house.\n\n\"Good-evening,\" she whispered.\n\nRezanov gave the grill an angry shake.  (Santiago had considerately\nretired.)  \"Come out,\" he said peremptorily, \"or let me in.\"\n\n\"There is but one gate, senor, and that is directly in front of the\nhouse door, that stands open--\"\n\n\"Then I shall get over the wall--\"\n\n\"Madre de Dios!  You would leave your fine clothes and more on the\nthorns.  My cousin planted those roses not for ornament, but to let the\nblood of defiant lovers.  Not one has come twice--\"\n\n\"Do you think I came here to talk to you through a grating?  I am no\nserenading Spaniard.\"\n\nHis eyes were blazing.  Adobe is not stone. Rezanov took the light bars\nin both hands and wrenched them out; then, as Concha, divided between\nlaughter and a sudden timidity, would have retreated, he dexterously\nclasped her neck and drew her head through the embrasure.  As Santiago,\nwho had watched Rezanov from a distance with some curiosity, saw his\nsister's beautiful face emerge from the wall to disappear at once\nbehind another rampart, he turned abruptly on his heel and could have\nwept as he thought of Pilar Ortego of Santa Barbara.  But there was a\nhope that he would be a cadet of the Southern Company before the year\nwas out, and his parents and hers were indulgent. Even as he sighed,\nhis own impending happiness infused him with an almost patronizing\nsympathy for the twain with the wall between, and he concealed himself\namong the willows that they might feel to the full the blessed\nisolation of lovers.  His Pilar presented him with twenty-two hostages,\nand he lived to enjoy an honorable and prosperous career, but he never\nforgot that night and the part he had played in one of the poignant and\nhappy hours of his sister's life.\n\nDay and night a great silence reigned in the Mission valley, broken\nonly by the hoot of the owl, the singing of birds, the flight of horses\nacross the plain.  Even the low huddle of Mission buildings and the few\nhomes beyond looked an anomaly in that vast quiet valley asleep and\nunknown for so many centuries in the wide embrace of the hills.  Its\njewel oasis alone made it acceptable to the Spaniard, but to Rezanov\nthe sandy desert, with its close companionable silences, its cool night\nair sweet with the light chaste fragrance of the roses, the simple,\nalmost primitive, conditions environing the girl, possessed a power to\nstir the depths of his emotions as no artful reinforcement to passion\nhad ever done.  He forgot the wall.  His ego melted in a sense of\ncomplete union and happiness.  Even when they returned to earth and\ndiscussed the dubious future, he was conscious of an odd resignation,\nvery alien in his nature, not only to the barrier but to all the\nstrange conditions of his wooing.  He had felt something of this\nbefore, although less definitely, and to-night he concluded that she\nhad the gift of clothing the inevitable with the semblance and the\nsweetness of choice; and wondered how long it would be able to skirt\nthe arid steppes of philosophy.\n\nShe told him that she had talked daily with Father Abella.  \"He will\nsay nothing to admit he is weakening, but I feel sure he has realized\nnot only that our marriage will be for the best interests of\nCalifornia, but that to forbid it would wreck my life; and from this\nresponsibility he shrinks.  I can see it in his kind, shrewd, perplexed\neyes, in the hesitating inflections of his voice, to say nothing of the\npoor arguments he advances to mine.  What of my father and mother?\"\n\n\"They look troubled, almost ill, but nothing could exceed their\nkindness to me, although they have pointedly given me no opportunity to\nintroduce the subject of our marriage again.  The Governor makes no\nsign that he knows of any aspiration of mine above corn, but he\ninformed me to-day that California is doomed to abandonment, that the\nIndians are hopeless, that Spain will withdraw troops before she will\nsend others, and that the country will either revert to savagery or\nfall a prey to the first enterprising outsider.  As he was in\ncomparison cheerful before, I fancy he apprehends the irresistible\nappeal of your father's surrender.\"\n\nConcha nodded.  \"If my father yields he will see that you have\neverything else that you wish.  He may have advocated meeting your\nwishes in other respects in order to leave you without excuse to\nlinger, but that argument is not strong enough for the Governor,\nwhereas if he made up his mind to accept you as a son he would throw\nthe whole force of his character and will into the scale; and when he\nreaches that pitch he wins--with men.  I must, must bring you good\nfortune,\" she added anxiously. \"Marriage with a little California\ngirl--are you sure it will not ruin your career?\"\n\n\"I can think of nothing that would advantage it more.  What are you\ngoing to call me?\"\n\n\"I cannot say Petrovich or Nicolai--my Spanish tongue rebels.  I shall\ncall you Pedro.  That is a very pretty name with us.\"\n\n\"My own harsh names suit my battered self rather better, but the more\nCalifornian you are and remain the happier I shall be.  When am I to\nsee your ears?  Are they deformed, pointed and furry like a fawn's?  Do\nthey stand out?  Were all the women of California tattooed in some\nIndian raid--\"\n\nConcha glanced about apprehensively, but not even Santiago was there to\nsee the dreadful deed. With a defiant sweep of her hands she lifted\nboth loops of hair, and two little ears, rosy even in the moonlight,\ncommanded amends and more from penitent lips.\n\n\"No man has ever seen them before--since I was a baby; not even my\nfather and brothers,\" said Concha, trembling between horror and rapture\nat the tremendous surrender.  \"You will never remind me of it.  Ay yi!\npromise--Pedro mio!\"\n\n\"On condition that you promise not to confess it.  I should like to be\nsure that your mind belonged as much to me and as little to others as\npossible.  I do not object to confession--we have it in our church; but\nremember that there are other things as sacred as your religion.\"\n\nShe nodded.  \"I understand--better than you understand Romanism.  I\nmust confess that I met you to-night, but Father Abella is too discreet\nto ask for more.  It is such blessed memories that feed the soul, and\nthey would fly away on a whisper.\"\n\n\n\nXX\n\nThe next morning Father Abella rode over to the Presidio and was\ncloseted for an hour with the Commandante and the Governor.  Then the\nthree rode down to the beach, entered a canoe, and paddled out to the\nJuno.  Rezanov met them on deck with a gravity as significant as their\nown, but led them at once to the cabin where wine, and the cigarettes\nfor which alone they would have counselled the treaty, awaited them.\n\nThe quartette pledged each other in an embarrassed silence, disposed of\na moment more with obdurate matches.  Don Jose inhaled audibly, then\nlifted his eyes and met the veiled and steady gaze of the Russian.\n\n\"Senor,\" he said, \"I have come to tell you that I consent to your\nmarriage with my daughter.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Rezanov.  And their hands clasped across the table.\n\nBut this was far too simple for the taste of a Governor.  So important\nan occasion demanded official dignity and many words.\n\n\"Your excellency,\" he said severely, sitting very erect, with one white\nhand on the table and the other on the hilt of his sword (yet full of\ncourtesy, and longing to enjoy the cheer and conversation of his host);\n\"the peaceful monotony of our lives has been rudely shaken by a demand\nupon three fallible human beings to alter the course of history in two\ngreat nations.  That is a sufficient excuse for the suspense to which\nwe have been forced to subject you.  The marriage of a Russian and a\nSpaniard is of no great moment in itself, but the marriage of the\nPlenipotentiary of the Tsar himself with the daughter of Jose Mario\nArguello, not only one of the most eminent, respected, and\ndistinguished of His Most Catholic Majesty's subjects in New Spain, but\na man so beloved and influential that he could create a revolution were\nhe so minded--indeed, Jose, no one knows better than I how incapable\nyou are of treason\"--as the Commandante gave a loud exclamation of\nhorror--\"I merely illustrate and emphasize.  My sands are nearly run,\nExcellency; it is to the estimable mind and strong paternal hand of my\nfriend that this miserable colony must look before long, would she\ncontinue even this hand to mouth existence--a fact well known to our\nking and natural lord.  When he hears of this projected alliance--\"\n\n\"Projected?\" exclaimed Rezanov.  \"I wish to marry at once.\"\n\nFather Abella shook his head vigorously, but he spoke with great\nkindness.  \"That, Excellency, alas, is the one point upon which we are\nforced to disappoint you.  Indeed, our own submission to your wishes is\ncontingent.  This marriage cannot take place without a dispensation\nfrom Rome and the consent of the King.\"\n\nRezanov looked at Don Jose.  \"You, too?\" he asked curtly.\n\nThe Commandante stirred uneasily, heaved a deep sigh; he thought of the\nlong impatience of his Concha.  \"It is true,\" he said.  \"Not only would\nit be impossible for my conscience to resign itself to the marriage of\nmy daughter with a heretic--pardon, Excellency--without the blessing of\nthe Pope; not only would no priest in California perform the ceremony\nuntil it arrived, but it would mean the degradation of Governor\nArrillaga and myself, and the ruin of all your other hopes.  We should\nbe ordered summarily to Mexico, perhaps worse, and no Russian would\never be permitted to set foot in the Californias again.  I would it\nwere otherwise. I know--I know--but it is inevitable.  Your excellency\nmust see it.  Even were you a Catholic, Governor Arrillaga and the\nPresident of the Missions, at least, would not dare to countenance this\nmarriage without the consent of the King.\"\n\nRezanov was silent for a few minutes.  In spite of the emotions of the\npast few days he was astonished at the depth and keenness of his\ndisappointment.  But never yet had he failed to realize when he was\nbeaten, nor to trim his sails without loss of precious time.\n\n\"Very well,\" he said.  \"I will go to St. Petersburg at the earliest\npossible moment, obtain personal letters from the Tsar and proceed post\nhaste to Rome and Madrid.  At the same time I shall arrange for the\ntreaty with full authority from the Tsar.  Then I shall sail from Spain\nto Mexico and reach here as soon as may be.  It will take a long while,\nthe best part of two years; but I have your word--\"\n\n\"You have,\" the three asserted with solemn emphasis.\n\n\"Very well.  But there is one thing more.  I am not in a diplomatic\nhumor.  My Sitkans are starving.  I must leave here with a shipload of\nbreadstuffs.\"\n\nAgain the Governor drew up his slim soldierly figure; deposited his\ncigarette on the malachite ash tray.  \"You may be sure that we have\ngiven that momentous question our deepest consideration. Father\nAbella's suggestion that we buy your commodities for cash, and that\nwith our Spanish dollars you buy again of us, did not strike me\nfavorably at first, for it savored of sophistry.  I may have failed in\nevery attempt to benefit and advance this Godforsaken country, but at\nleast I have been the honest agent of my King.  But the circumstances\nare extraordinary.  You are about to become one of us, to do our\nunhappy colony the greatest service that is in the power of any mortal,\nand personally you have inspired us with affection and respect.  I\nhave, therefore, decided that the exchange shall be made on these\nterms, but that your cargo shall be received by Don Jose Arguello,\nCommandante of the San Francisco Company, and held in trust until the\nformal consent of the King to the purchase shall arrive.\"\n\nRezanov glowed to his finger tips.  Not even the assurance of his union\nwith the woman of his heart, which after all had met but the skeleton\nof his desires, gave him the acute satisfaction of this sudden\nfulfilment of his self-imposed mission.  He dropped his own official\ndemeanor and throwing himself across the table gripped the Governor's\nhand while he poured out his thanks in a voice thick with feeling, his\neyes glittering with more than victory.  He did not lose sight of his\nultimate designs and pledge himself to external friendship, but he\nunwittingly conveyed the impression that Spain had that day made a\nfriend she ill could afford to lose; and his three visitors rose well\npleased with the culmination of the interview.\n\n\"You must stay here no longer, Rezanov,\" said Don Jose, as they were\ntaking leave.  \"My house is now literally your own.  It will be some\nweeks before the large quantities of corn and flour and other stores\nyou wish can be got together--for we must lay a requisition on the\nfertile Mission ranchos in the valleys--and you will exchange these\nnarrow quarters for such poor comfort as my house affords--I take no\ndenial.  Concha will remain at Juan Moraga's for the present.\"\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nConcha, after her father left her, sat for a long while in an attitude\nof such complete repose that Sturgis, watching her miserably from the\nveranda, remembered the consolations of his sketch book; and he was\nable to counterfeit the graceful, proud figure, under the wall and\nroses, before she stirred.\n\nConcha had sent her father away deeply puzzled. When, after embracing\nher with unusual emotion, he had informed her of his consent to her\nmarriage, she had received the news as a matter of course, her hopes\nand desires having mounted too high to contemplate a fall.  Then the\nCommandante, after dwelling at some length upon his discussions with\nthe Governor and the priests, and admonishing her against conceiving\nherself too important a factor in what might prove to be an alliance of\ninternational moment (she had laughed merrily and called him the most\ncallous of parents and subtlest of diplomats), had announced with some\ntrepidation and his most official manner that the consent of the Pope\nand the King would be sought by Rezanov in person, involving a delay\nand separation of not less than two years.  But to his surprise she did\nnot fling herself upon his neck with blandishments and tears. She\nmerely became quite still, her light high spirits retreating as a\nbreeze might before one of Nature's sudden and portentous calms.  Don\nJose, after a fruitless attempt to recapture her interest, mounted his\nhorse and rode away; and Concha sat down on a bench under the wall and\nthought for an hour without moving a finger.\n\nHer first sensation was one of bitter anger and disappointment with\nRezanov.  He had, apparently, in the first brief interview with their\ntribunal, given his consent to this long delay of their nuptials.\n\nHer thoughts since his advent had flown on many journeys and known\nlittle rest.  She had been rudely awakened and stripped of her girlish\nillusions in those days and nights of battle between pride and her\ndazzled womanhood when, in the new humility of love, she believed\nherself to be but one of a hundred pretty girls in the eyes of this\naccomplished and fortunate Russian.  The interval had been brief, but\nnot long enough for the grandeur in her nature to awaken almost\nconcurrently with her passions, and she had planned a life, in which,\nguided and uplifted by the star of fidelity, and delivered from the\nfrivolous and commonplace temptations of other women, she should devote\nherself to the improvement and instruction not only of the Indians but\nof the youth of her own class.  The schools founded by the estimable\nand enterprising Borica had practically disappeared, and she was by far\nthe best educated woman in California.  For such there was a manifest\nand an inexorable duty.  She would live to be old, she supposed, like\nall the Arguellos and Moragas; but hidden in her unspotted soul would\nbe the flame of eternal youth, fed by an ideal and a memory that would\noutlive her weary, insignificant body.  And in it she would find her\ncourage and her inspiration, as well as an unwasting sympathy for those\nshe taught.\n\nThen had come the sudden and passionate wooing of Rezanov.  All other\nideals and aspirations had fled.  She had alternated between the tragic\nextremes of bliss and despair.  So completely did the ardor of her\nnature respond to his, so fierce and primitive was the cry of her ego\nfor its mate, that she cared nothing for the distress of her parents\nnor the fate of California.  There is no love complete without this\nearly and absolute selfishness, which is merely the furious\ndetermination of the race to accomplish its object before the spirit\nawakens and the passions cool.\n\nLast night life had seemed serious; she had been girlishly,\nromantically happy.  It is true that her heart had thumped against the\nwall as he kissed her, and that she had been full of a wild desire to\nsing, although she could hardly shape and utter the words that danced\nin her throbbing brain.  But she had been conscious through it all of\nthe romantic circumstance, of the lonely beauty of the night, of the\ndelightful wickedness of meeting her lover in the silence and the dark,\neven with a wall ten feet high between them.  For the wall, indeed, she\nhad been confusedly and deliciously grateful.\n\nAnd this was what a man's love came to: ardors by night and expedience\nby day!  Or was it merely that Rezanov was the man of affairs always,\nthe lover incidentally?  But how could a man who had seemed the very\nepitome of all the lovers of all the world but a few hours before,\ncontemplate, far less permit, a separation of years?  Poor Concha\ngroped toward the great unacceptable fact of life the whole, lit by\nlove its chief incident; and had a fleeting vision of the waste lands\nin the lives of women occupied only with matrimony.  But she dropped\nher lashes upon this unalluring vision, and as she did so, inevitably\nshe began to excuse the man.\n\nNone knew better than she every side of the great question that was\nshaking not only her life but California itself.  Appeal from the\ndictum of state and clergy would be a mere waste of time.  The only\nalternative was flight.  That would mean the wreck of Rezanov's avowed\npurposes in coming to this quarter of New Spain, and perhaps of others\nshe dimly suspected.  It would mean the very acme of misery for his\nSitkans, and an indefensible blow to the Company.  It might even prove\nthe fatal mistake in his career, for which his enemies were ever on the\nalert.  He was not communicative about himself except when he had an\nobject in view, but he had told her something of his life, and his\nofficers and Langsdorff had told more.  He was no silly caballero\nwarbling and thrumming at her grating when she longed for sleep, but a\nman in his forties whose passions were in the leash of a remarkably\nacute and ambitious brain.  She even thrilled with pride in his\nstrength, for she knew how he loved her; and although his part was\naction, her stimulated instincts taught her that she would rarely be\nlong from his mind.  And what was she to seek to roll stumbling blocks\ninto the career of a man like that? In this very garden, for four long\ndays, she had dreamed exalted dreams of the manifold gifts she should\ndevelop for his solace at home and his worldly advancement.  She had\nonce felt all a girl's impatience when her mother's tears made her\nfather's departure on some distant mission more difficult than need be,\nand although she knew now that her capacity for tenderness was as\ngreat, she resolved to mould herself in a larger shape than that.\n\nBut she sighed and drooped a little.  The burden of woman's waiting\nseemed already to have descended upon her.  Two years were long--long.\nThere might be other delays.  He might fall ill; he had been ill before\nin that barbarous Russian north. And in all that time it was doubtful\nif she received a line from him, a hint of his welfare.  The Boston and\nBritish skippers came no more, and it was certain that no Russian ship\nwould visit California again until the treaty was signed and official\nnews of it had made its slow way to these uttermost shores.  She had\nresented, in her young ambition and indocility, the chance that had\nstranded her, equipped for civilization, on this rim of the world, but\nnever so much as in that moment, when she sat with arrested breath and\nrealized to the full the primitive conditions of a country thousands of\nmiles from the very outposts of Europe, and with never the sight of a\nletter that did not come from Spain or one of her colonies.\n\n\"Would that we lived a generation later,\" she thought with a heavy\nsigh.  \"Progress is almost automatic, and to a land as fertile and\ndesirable as this the stream must turn in due course.  But not in my\ntime.  Not in my time.\"\n\nShe rose and leaned her elbows in the embrasure of the grille, where\nSantiago had restored the bars, and looked out over the fields of grain\nplanted by the padres, the immense sand dunes beyond that shut the\nlovely bay from sight; the hills embracing the primitive scene in a\nfrowning arc.  With all her imagination it was long before she could\npicture a great city covering that immense and almost deserted space.\nA pueblo in time, perhaps, for Rezanov had awakened her mind to the\nimportance of the harbor as a port of call.  Many more adobe homes\nwhere the sand was not hot and shifting, a few ships in the bay when\nSpain had been compelled to relax her jealous vigilance--or--who\nknew?--perhaps!--a flourishing colony when the Russian bear had\ndevoured the Spanish lion.  She knew something and suspected more of\nthe rottenness and inefficiency of Spain, and, were Russia a nation of\nRezanovs, what opposition in California against the tide thundering\ndown from the north?  Then, perhaps, the city that had travelled from\nthe brain of the Russian to hers when the fog had rolled over the\nheights; the towers and palaces and bazaars, the thousand little golden\ndomes with the slender cross atop; the forts on the crags and the\nvillas in the hollows, and on all the island and hills.  But when she\nand her lover were dust.  When she and her lover were dust.\n\nBut she was too young and too ardent to listen long to the ravens of\nthe spirit.  Two years are not eternity, and in happiness the past\nrolls together like a scroll and is naught.  She fell to dreaming.  Her\nlips that had been set with the gravity of stone relaxed in warm\ncurves.  The color came back to her cheek, the light to her eyes.  She\nwas a girl at her grating with the roses poignant above her, and the\nworld, radiant, alluring, and all for her, swimming in the violet haze\nbeyond.\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nRezanov in those days was literally lord and master at the Presidio.\nIf he did not burn the house of his devoted host he ran it to suit\nhimself.  He turned one of its rooms into an office, where he received\nthe envoys from the different Missions and examined the samples of\neverything submitted to him, trusting little to his commissary.  His\nleisure he employed scouring the country or shooting deer and quail in\nthe company of his younger hosts.  The literal mind of Don Jose\naccepted him as an actual son and embryonic California, and, his\nconscience at peace, revelled in his society as a sign from propitiated\nheaven; rejoicing in the virtue of his years.  The Governor, testily\nremarking that as California was so well governed for the present he\nwould retire to Monterey and take a siesta, rode off one morning, but\nnot without an affectionate: \"God preserve the life of your excellency\nmany years.\"\n\nBut although Rezanov saw the most sanguine hopes that had brought him\nto California fulfilled, and although he looked from the mountain\nridges of the east over the great low valleys watered by rivers and\nshaded by oaks, where enough grain could be raised to keep the blood\nred in a thousand times the colonial population of Russia, although he\nfelt himself in more and more abundant health, more and more in love\nwith life, it is not to be supposed for a moment that he was satisfied.\nConcha he barely saw.  She remained with the Moragas, and although she\ncame occasionally to the afternoon dances at the Presidio, and he had\ndined once at her cousin's house, where the formal betrothal had taken\nplace and the marriage contract had been signed in the presence of her\nfamily and more intimate friends, the priests, his officers, and the\nGovernor, he had not spoken with her for a moment alone.  Nor had her\neyes met his in a glance of understanding.  At the dances she showed\nhim no favor; and as the engagement was to be as secret as might be in\nthat small community, until his return with consent of Pope and King,\nhe was forced to concede that her conduct was irreproachable; but when\non the day of the betrothal she was oblivious to his efforts to draw\nher into the garden, he mounted his horse and rode off in a huff.\n\nThe truth was that Concha liked the present arrangement no better than\nhimself, and knowing that her own appeal against the proprieties would\nresult in a deeper seclusion, she determined to goad him into using\nevery resource of address and subtlety to bring about a more human\nstate of affairs.  And she accomplished her object.  Rezanov, at the\nend of a week was not only infuriated but alarmed.  He knew the\nimagination of woman, and guessed that Concha, in her brooding\nsolitude, distorted all that was unfortunate in the present and dwelt\nmorbidly on the future.  He knew that she must resent his part in the\nlong separation, no doubt his lack of impulsiveness in not proposing\nelopement.  There was a priest in his company who, although he ate\nbelow the salt and found his associates among the sailors, could have\nperformed the ceremony of marriage when the Juno, under full sail in\nthe night, was scudding for the Russian north.  It is not to be denied\nthat this romantic alternative appealed to Rezanov, and had it not been\nfor the starving wretches so eagerly awaiting his coming he might have\nbeen tempted to throw commercial relations to the winds and flee with\nhis bride while San Francisco, secure in the knowledge of the Juno's\nempty hold, was in its first heavy sleep.  It is doubtful if he would\nhave advanced beyond impulse, for Rezanov was not the man to lose sight\nof a purpose to which he had set the full strength of his talents, and\nlife had tempered his impetuous nature with much philosophy.  Moreover,\nwhile his conscience might ignore the double dealing necessary to the\naccomplishment of patriotic or political acts, it revolted at the idea\nof outwitting, possibly wrecking, his trusting and hospitable host.\nBut the mere fact that his imagination could dwell upon such an issue\nas reckless flight, inflamed his impatience, and his desire to see\nConcha daily during these last few weeks of propinquity.  Finally, he\nsought the co-operation of Father Abella--Santiago was in Monterey--and\nthat wise student of maids and men gave him cheer.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon there was to take place the long delayed Indian\ndance and bull-bear fight; not in the Presidio, but at the Mission, the\npride of the friars inciting them to succeed where the military\nauthorities had failed.  All the little world of San Francisco had been\ninvited, and it would be strange if in the confusion between\nperformance and supper a lover could not find a moment alone with his\nlady.\n\nThe elements were kind to the padres.  The afternoon was not too hot,\nalthough the sun flooded the plain and there was not a cloud on the\ndazzling blue of the sky.  Never had the Mission and the mansions\nlooked so white, their tiles so red.  The trees were blossoming pink\nand white in the orchards, the lightest breeze rippled the green of the\nfields; and into this valley came neither the winds nor the fogs of the\nocean.\n\nThe priests and their guests of honor sat on the long corridor beside\nthe church; the soldiers, sailors, and Indians of Presidio and Mission\nforming the other three sides of a hollow square.  The Indian women\nwere a blaze of color.  The ladies on the corridor wore their\nmantillas, jewels, and the gayest of artificial flowers.  There were as\nmany fans as women.  Rezanov sat between Father Abella and the\nCommandante, and not being in the best of tempers had never looked more\nimposing and remote.  Concha, leaning against one of the pillars, stole\na glance at him and wondered miserably if this haughty European had\nreally sought her hand, if it were not a girl's foolish dream.  But\nConcha's humble moments at this period of her life were rare, and she\ndrew herself up proudly, the blood of the proudest race in Europe\nshaking angrily in her veins.  A moment later, in response to a power\ngreater than any within herself, she turned again. The attention of the\nhosts and guests was riveted upon the preliminary antics of the Indian\ndancers, and Rezanov seized the opportunity to lean forward unobserved\nand gaze at the girl whom it seemed to him he saw for the first time in\nthe full splendor of her beauty.  She wore a large mantilla of white\nSpanish lace.  In the fashion of the day it rose at the back almost\nfrom the hem of her gown to descend in a point over the high comb to\nher eyes. The two points of the width were gathered at her breast,\ndefining the outlines of her superb figure, and fastened with one large\nCastilian rose surrounded by its mass of tiny sharp buds and dull green\nleaves.  As the familiar scent assailed Rezanov's nostrils they tingled\nand expanded.  His lids were lifted and his eyes glowing as he finally\ncompelled her glance, and her own eyes opened with an eager flash; her\nlips parted and her shoulders lost their haughty poise.  For a moment\ntheir gaze lingered in a perfect understanding; his ill-humor vanished,\nand he leaned back with a complimentary remark as Father Abella\ndirected his attention to the most agile of the Indians.\n\nThe swart natives of both sexes with their thick features and long hair\nwere even more hideous than usual in bandeaux of bright feathers, scant\ngarments made from the breasts of water-fowls, rattling strings of\nshells, and tattooing on arm and leg no longer concealed by the\ndecorous Mission smock.  Rezanov had that day sent them presents of\nglass beads and ribbons, and in these they took such extravagant pride\nthat for some time their dancing was almost automatic.\n\nBut soon their blood warmed, and after the first dance, which was\nmerely a series of measured springs on the part of the men and a\nbeating of time by the women, a large straw figure symbolizing an\nentire hostile tribe was brought in, and about this pranced the men\nwith savage cries and gestures, advancing, attacking, retreating,\nfinally piercing it with their arrows and marching it off with sharp\nyells of triumph that reverberated among the hills; the women never\nvarying from a loud monotonous chant.\n\nThere was a peaceful interlude, during which the men, holding bow and\narrow aloft, hopped up and down on one spot, the women hopping beside\nthem and snapping thumb and forefinger on the body, still singing in\nthe same high measured voice.  But while they danced a great bonfire\nwas laid and kindled.  The gyrations lasted a few minutes longer, then\nthe chief seized a live ember and swallowed it. His example was\nimmediately followed by his tribe, and, whether to relieve discomfort\nor with energies but quickened, they executed a series of incredible\nhandsprings and acrobatic capers.  When they finally whirled away on\ntoes and finger tips, another chief, in the horns and hide of a deer,\nrushed in, pursued by a party of hunters.  For several moments he\nperfectly simulated a hunted animal lurking and dodging in high grass,\nbehind trees, venturing to the brink of a stream to drink, searching\neagerly for his mate; and when he finally escaped it was amidst the\nmost enthusiastic plaudits as yet evoked.\n\nAfter an hour of this varied performance, the square was enlarged by\nseveral mounted vaqueros galloping about with warning cries and much\nflourishing of lassos.  They were the cattle herders of the Mission\nranch just over the hills, and were in gala attire of black glazed\nsombrero with silver cord, white shirt open at the throat, short black\nvelvet trousers laced with silver, red sash and high yellow boots.\nFour, pistol in hand, stationed themselves in front of the corridor,\nwhile the others rode out and in again, dragging a bear and a bull,\nwith hind legs attached by two yards of rope.  The captors left the\ncaptives in the middle of the square, and without more ado the serious\nsport of the day began.  The bull, with stomach empty and hide\ninflamed, rushed at the bear, furious from captivity, with such a roar\nthat the Indian women screamed and even the men shuffled their feet\nuneasily.  But neither combatant was interested in aught but the other.\nThe one sought to gore, his enemy to strike or hug.  The vaqueros\nteased them with arrows and cries, the dust flew; for a few moments\nthere was but a heaving, panting, lashing bulk in the middle of the\narena, and then the bull, his tongue torn out, rolled on his back, and\nanother was driven in before the victor could wreak his unsated\nvengeance among the spectators.  The bear, dragging the dead bull,\nrushed at the living, who, unmartial at first, stiffened to the\ndefensive as he saw a bulk of wiry fur set with eyes of fire, almost\nupon him. He sprang aside, lowered his horn and caught the bear in the\nchest.  But the victor was a compact mass of battle and momentum.  His\nonslaught flung the bear over backward, and quickly disengaging himself\nhe made another leap at his equally agile enemy.  This time the battle\nwas longer and more various, for the bull was smaller, more active and\ndexterous.  Twice he almost had the bear on his horns, but was rolled,\nonly saving his neck and back from the fury of the mountain beast by\nsuch kicking and leaping that both combatants were indistinguishable\nfrom the whirlwind of dust.  Out of this they would emerge to stand\npanting in front of each other with tongues pendant and red eyes\nrolling.  Finally the bear, nearly exhausted, made a sudden charge, the\nbull leaped aside, backed again with incredible swiftness, caught the\nbear in the belly, tossed him so high that he met the hard earth with a\nloud cracking of bone.  The vaqueros circled about the maddened bull,\nset his hide thick with arrows, tripped him with the lasso.  A wiry\nlittle Mexican in yellow, galloping in on his mustang, administered the\ncoup de grace amidst the wild applause of the spectators, whose\nshouting and clapping and stamping might have been heard by the envious\nguard at the Presidio and Yerba Buena.\n\nAs the party on the corridor broke, Rezanov found no difficulty in\nreaching Concha's side, for even Dona Ignacia was chattering wildly\nwith several other good dames who renewed their youth briefly at the\nbull-fight.\n\n\"Did you enjoy that?\" he asked curiously.\n\n\"I did not look at it.  I never do.  But I know that you were not\naffronted.  You never took your eyes from those dreadful beasts.\"\n\n\"I am exhilarated to know that you watched me. Yes, at a bull-fight the\nprimitive man in me has its way, although I have the grace to be\nashamed of myself afterward.  In that I am at least one degree more\ncivilized than your race, which never repents.\"\n\nThe door of one of the smaller rooms stood open, and as they took\nadvantage of this oversight with a singular concert of motive, he\nclasped both her hands in his.  \"Are you angry with me?\" he asked\nsoftly.  He dared not close the door, but his back was square against\nit, and the other guests were moving down to the refectory.\n\n\"For liking such horrid sport?\"\n\n\"We have no time to waste in coquetry.\"\n\nHer eyes melted, but she could not resist planting a dart.  \"Not now--I\nquite understand: love could never be first with you.  And two years\nare not so long.  They quickly pass when one is busy.  I shall find\noccupation, and you will have no time for longings and regrets.\"\n\nThey were not yet alone, women were talking in their light, high voices\nnot a yard away.  The hindrance, and her new loveliness in the soft\nmantilla, the pink of the roses reflected in her throat, the\nprovocative curl of her mouth, sent the blood to his head.\n\n\"You have only to say the word,\" he said hoarsely, \"and the Juno will\nsail to-night.\"\n\nNever before had she seen his face so unmasked. Her voice shook in\ntriumph and response.\n\n\"Would you?  Would you?\"\n\n\"Say the word!\"\n\n\"You would sacrifice all--the Company--your career--your Sitkans?\"\n\n\"All--everything.\"  His own voice shook with more than passion, for\neven in that moment he counted the cost, but he did not care.\n\nBut Concha detected that second break in his voice, and turned her head\nsadly.\n\n\"You would not say that to-morrow.  I hate myself that I made you say\nit now.  I love you enough to wait forever, but I have not the courage\nto hand you over to your enemies.\"\n\n\"You are strangely far-sighted for a young girl.\" And between\nadmiration and pique, his ardor suffered a chill.\n\n\"I am no longer a young girl.  In these last days it has seemed to me\nthat secrets locked in my brain, secrets of women long dead, but of\nwhose essence I am, have come forth to the light.  I have suffered in\nanticipation.  My mind has flown--flown--I have lived those two years\nuntil they are twenty, thirty, and I have lived on into old age here by\nthe sea, watching, watching--\"\n\nShe had dropped all pretence of coquetry and was speaking with a\npassionate forlornness.  But before he could interrupt her, take\nadvantage of the retreating voices that left them alone at last, she\nhad drawn herself up and moved a step away.  \"Do not think, however,\"\nshe said proudly, \"that I am really as weak and silly as that.  It was\nonly a mood.  Should you not return I should grieve, yes; and should I\nlive as long as is common with my race, still would my heart remain\nyoung with your image, and with the fidelity that would be no less a\nreligion than that of my church.  But I should not live a selfish life,\nor I should be unworthy of my election to experience a great and\neternal passion. Memory and the life of the imagination would be my\nsolace, possibly in time my happiness, but my days I should give to\nthis poor little world of ours; and all that one mortal, and that a\nwoman, has to bestow upon a stranded and benighted people.  It may not\nbe much, but I make you that promise, senor, that you will not think me\na foolish, romantic girl, unworthy of the great responsibilities you\nhave offered me.\"\n\n\"Concha!\"  He was deeply moved, and at the same time her words chilled\nhim with subtle prophecy, sank into some unexplored depth of his\nconsciousness, meeting response as subtle, filling him with impatience\nat the mortality of man.  He glanced over his shoulder, then took her\nrecklessly in his arms.\n\n\"Is it possible you doubt I will come back?\" he demanded.  \"My faith?\"\n\n\"No, not that.  But such happiness seems to me too great for this life.\"\n\nHe remembered how often he had been close to death; he knew that during\nthe greater part of the next two years he should see the glimmer of the\nscythe oftener yet.  For a moment it seemed to him that he felt the\ndark waters rise in his soul, heard the jeers of the gods at the vanity\nof mortal will.  But the blood ran strong and warm in his veins.  He\nshook off the obsession, and smiled a little cynically, even as he\nkissed her.\n\n\"This is the hour for romance, my dear.  In the years to come, when you\nare very prosaically my wife with a thousand duties, and grumbling at\nmy exactions, your consolation will be the memory of some moment like\nthis, when you were able to feel romantic and sad.  I wish I could\narrange for some such set of memories for myself, but I am unequal to\nyour divine melancholy.  When I cannot see you I am cross and sulky;\nand just now--I am, well--philosophically happy.  Some day I shall be\nhappier, but this is well enough.  And I can harbor no ugly\npresentiments.  As I entered California I was elated with a sense of\ncoming happiness, of future victories; and I prefer to dwell upon that,\nthe more particularly as in a measure the prophetic hint has been\nfulfilled.  So make the most of the present.  I shall see you daily\nduring this last precious fortnight, for I am determined this\narrangement shall cease; and you must exorcise coquetry and abet me\nwhenever there is a chance of a word alone.\"\n\nShe nodded, but she noted with a sigh that he said no more of sudden\nflight.  She would never have consented to jeopardize the least of his\ninterests, but she fain would have been besought. The experience she\nhad had of the vehemence and fire in Rezanov made her long for his\ncomplete subjugation and the happiness it must bring to herself.  But\nas he smiled tenderly above her she saw that his practical brain had\nsilenced the irresponsible demands of love, and although she did not\nwithdraw from his arms she stiffened her head.\n\n\"I fancy I shall return home to-morrow,\" she said.  \"My mother tells me\nthat she can live without me no longer, and that Father Abella has\nreminded her that if I stay in the house of Elena Castro I shall be as\nfree from gossip as here.  I infer that he has rated my two parents for\nmaking a martyr of me unnecessarily, and told them it was a duty to\nenliven my life as much as possible before I enter upon this long\nperiod of probation.  The grating of my room at Elena's is above a\nlittle strip of Garden, and faces the blank wall of the next house.\nSometimes--who knows?\"  She shrugged her shoulders and gave a gay\nlittle laugh, then stood very erect and moved past him to the door.\nShe had recognized the shuffling step of Father Abella.\n\n\"Is supper ready, padre mio?\" she asked sweetly. \"His excellency and I\nhave talked so much that we are very hungry.\"\n\n\"There is no need to deceive me,\" said Father Abella dryly.  \"You are\nnot the first lovers I have known, although I will admit you are by far\nthe most interesting, and for that reason I have had the wickedness to\nabet you.  But I fancy the good God will forgive me.  Come quickly.\nThey are scattered now, but will go to the refectory in a moment and\nmiss you.  Excellency, will you give your arm to Dona Ignacia and take\nthe seat at the head of the table?  Concha, my child, I am afraid you\nmust console our good Don Weeliam.  He is having a wretched quarter of\nan hour, but has loyally diverted the attention of your mother.\"\n\n\"That is the vocation of certain men,\" said Concha lightly.\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nLife was very gay for a fortnight.  An hour after the Commandante's\nsurrender he had despatched invitations to all the young folk of the\ngente de razon of Monterey, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego,\nand to such of the older as would brave the long journeys.  The\nMonterenos had arrived for the Mission entertainment, and during the\nnext few days the rest poured over the hills: De la Guerras, Xime'nos,\nEstudillos, Carrillos, Este'negas, Morenos, Cotas, Estradas, Picos,\nPachecos, Lugos, Orte'gas, Alvarados, Bandinis, Peraltas, members of\nthe Luis, Rodriguez, Lopez families, all of gentle blood, that made up\nthe society of Old California; as gay, arcadian, irresponsible, yet\nmoral a society as ever fluttered over this planet.  Every house in the\nPresidio and valley, every spare room at the Mission, opened to them\nwith the exuberant hospitality of the country. The caballeros had their\nfinest wardrobes of colored silks and embroidered botas, sombreros\nladen with silver, fine lawn and lace, jewel and sash, velvet serape\nfor the chill of the late afternoon.  The matrons brought their stiff\nrobes of red and yellow satin, the girls as many flowered silks and\nlawns, mantillas and rebosos, as the family carretas would hold.  The\nsquare of the Presidio was crowded from morning until midnight with the\nspirited horses of the country, prancing impatiently under the heavy\nMexican saddle, heavier with silver, made a trifle more endurable by\nthe blanket of velvet or cloth.  No Californian walked a dozen rods\nwhen he had a horse to carry him.\n\nBut the horses were not always champing in the square.  There was more\nthan one bull-bear fight, and twice a week at least they carried their\nowners to the hills of the Mission ranch, or the rocky cliffs and\ngorges above Yerba Buena, the Indian servants following with great\nbaskets of luncheon, perhaps roasting an ox whole in a trench.  This\nthe Californians called barbecue and the picnic merienda.\n\nThere was dancing day and night, the tinkling of guitars, flirting of\nfans.  Rezanov vowed he would not have believed there were so many fans\nand guitars in the world, and suddenly remembered he had never seen\nConcha with either.  The lady of his choice reigned supreme.  Many had\ntaken the long blistering journey for no other purpose than to see the\nfamous beauty and her Russian; the engagement was as well known as if\ncried from the Mission top.  The girls were surprised and delighted to\nfind Concha sweet rather than proud and envied her with amiable\nenthusiasm.  The caballeros, fewer in number, for most of the men in\nCalifornia at that period before a freer distribution of land were on\nduty in the army, artfully ignored the unavowed bond, but liked Rezanov\nwhen he took the trouble to charm them.\n\nKhostov and Davidov watched the loading of the Juno with a lively\nregret.  Never had they enjoyed themselves more, nor seen so many\npretty girls in one place.  Both had begun by falling in love with\nConcha, and although they rebounded swiftly from the blow to their\nhopes, it happily saved them from a more serious dilemma; unwealthed\nand graceless as they were, they would have been regarded with little\nfavor by the practical California father.  As it was, their pleasures\nwere unpoisoned by regrets or rebuffs.  When they were not flirting in\nthe dance or in front of a lattice, receiving a lesson in Spanish\nbehind the portly back of a duena, or clasping brown little fingers\nunder cover of a fan when all eyes were riveted on the death struggle\nof a bull and a bear, they were playing cards and drinking in the\nofficers' quarters; which they liked almost as well. It is true they\nsometimes paid the price in a cutting rebuke from their chief, but the\nrebukes were not as frequent as in less toward circumstances, and were\ngenerally followed by some fresh indulgence.  This, they uneasily\nguessed, was not only the result of the equable state of his\nexcellency's temper, but because he had a signal unpleasantness in\nstore, and would not hazard their resignation.  They had taken\nadvantage of an imperial ukase to enter the service of the\nRussian-American Company temporarily, and they knew that if they evaded\nany behest of Rezanov's their adventurous life in the Pacific would be\nover.  Therefore, although they resented his implacable will, they\npulled with him in outward amity; and indeed there were few of the\nJuno's human freight that did not look back upon that California\nspringtime as the episode of their lives, commonly stormy or\nmonotonous, in which the golden tide flowed with least alloy.  Even\nLangsdorff, although impervious to female charms and with scientific\nthirst unslaked, enjoyed the Spanish fare and the society of the\npriests.  The sailors received many privileges, attended bull-fights\nand fandangos, loved and pledged; and were only restrained from\nemigration to the interior of this enchanted land of pretty girls and\nplentiful food by the knowledge of the sure and merciless vengeance of\ntheir chief.  Had the rumor of war still held it might have been\notherwise, but that raven had flown off to the limbo of its kind, and\nthe Commandante let it be known that deserters would be summarily\ncaptured and sent in irons to the Juno.\n\nIn the mind of Concha Arguello there was never a lingering doubt of the\nquality of that fortnight between the days of torturing doubts and\nacute emotional upheaval, and the sailing away of Rezanov. It was true\nthat what he banteringly termed her romantic sadness possessed her at\ntimes, but it served as a shadow to throw into sharper relief an almost\nincredible happiness.  If she seldom saw Rezanov alone there was the\nless to disturb her, and at least he was never far from her side.\nThere were always the delight of unexpected moments unseen, whispered\nwords in the crowd, the sense of complete understanding, broken now and\nagain by poignant attacks of unreasoning jealousy, not only on her part\nbut his; quite worth the reconciliation at the lattice, while Elena\nCastro, gentle duena, pitched her voice high and amused her husband so\nwell he sought no opportunity for response.\n\nThen there was more than one excursion about the bay on the Juno,\ndinner on La Bellissima or Nuestra Senora de los Angeles, a long return\nafter sundown that the southerners might appreciate the splendor of the\nafterglow when the blue of the water was reflected in the lower sky, to\nmelt into the pink fire above, and all the land swam in a pearly mist.\n\nOnce the Commandante took twenty of his guests, a gay cavalcade, to his\nrancho, El Pilar, thirty miles to the south: a long valley flanked by\nthe bay and the eastern mountains on the one hand, and a high range\ndense with forests of tall thin trees on the other.  But the valley\nitself was less Californian than any part of the country Rezanov had\nseen. Smooth and flat and free of undergrowth and set with at least ten\nthousand oaks, it looked more like a splendid English park, long\npreserved, than the recent haunt of naked savages.  There were deer and\nquail in abundance, here and there an open field of grain.  Long beards\nof pale green moss waved from the white oaks, wild flowers, golden red\nand pale blue, burst underfoot.  There were hedges of sweet briar,\nacres of lupins, purple and yellow.  Altogether the ideal estate of a\nnobleman; and Rezanov, who had liked nothing in California so well,\ngave his imagination rein and saw the counterpart of the castle of his\nancestors rise in the deep shade of the trees.\n\nDon Jose's house was a long rambling adobe, red tiled, with many\nbedrooms and one immense hall. Beyond were a chapel and a dozen\noutbuildings. Dinner was served in patriarchal style in the hall, the\nCommandante--or El padrone as he was known here--and his guests at the\nupper end of the table; below the salt, the vaqueros, their wives and\nchildren, and the humble friar who drove them to prayer night and\nmorning.  The friar wore his brown robes, the vaqueros their black and\nsilver and red in honor of the company, their women glaring\nhandkerchiefs of green or red or yellow about their necks, even pinned\nback and front on their shapeless garments; and affording a fine\nvegetable garden contrast to the delicate flower bed surrounding the\npadrone.\n\nThere was a race track on the ranch and many fine horses.  After siesta\nthe company mounted fresh steeds and rode off to applaud the feats of\nthe vaqueros, who, not content with climbing the greased pole,\nwrenching the head of an unfortunate rooster from his buried body as\nthey galloped by, submitting the tail of an oiled pig in full flight to\nthe same indignity, gave when these and other native diversions were\nexhausted, such exhibitions of riding and racing as have never been\nseen out of California.  As lithe as willow wands, on slender horses as\ngraceful as themselves, they looked like meteors springing through\nspace, and there was no trick of the circus they did not know by\ninstinct, and translate from gymnastics into poetry.  Even Rezanov\nshared the excitement of the shouting, clapping Californians, and\nConcha laughed delightedly when his cap waved with the sombreros.\n\n\"I think you will make a good Californian in time,\" she said as they\nrode homeward.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Rezanov musingly.  His eyes roved over the magnificent\nestate and at the moment they entered a portion of it that deepened to\nwoods, so dense was the undergrowth, so thick the oak trees.  Here\nthere was but a glimpse, now and again, of the mountains swimming in\nthe dark blue mist of the late afternoon, the moss waved thickly from\nthe ancient trees; over even the higher branches of many rolled a\ncascade of small brittle leaves, with the tempting opulence of its\npoisonous sap.  The path was very abrupt, cut where the immense\nspreading trees permitted, and Rezanov and Concha had no difficulty in\nfalling away from the chattering, excited company.\n\n\"Tell me your ultimate plans, Pedro mio,\" said Concha softly.  \"You are\ndreaming of something this moment beyond corn and treaties.\"\n\n\"Do you want that final proof?\" he asked, smiling.  \"Well, if I could\nnot trust you that would be the end of everything, and I know that I\ncan.  I have long regarded California as an absolutely necessary field\nof supplies, and since I have come here I will frankly say that could\nI, as the representative of the Tsar in all this part of the world,\nmake it practically my own, I should be content in even a permanent\nexile from St. Petersburg.  I could attract an immense colony here and\nin time import libraries and works of art, laying the foundation of a\ngreat and important city on that fine site about Yerba Buena.  But now\nthat these kind people have practically adopted me I cannot repay their\nhospitality by any overt act of hostility.  I must be content either\nslowly to absorb the country, in which case I shall see no great result\nin my lifetime, or-and for this I hope--what with the mess Bonaparte is\nmaking of Europe, every state may be at the others' throat before long,\nincluding Russia and Spain.  At all events, a cause for rupture would\nnot be far to seek, and it would need no instigation of mine to\ndespatch a fleet to these shores.  In that case I should be sent with\nit to take possession in the name of the Tsar, and to deal with these\nsimple, kind--and inefficient people, my dear girl--as no other Russian\ncould.  They cannot hold this country.  Spain could not--would not, at\nall events, for she has not troops enough here to protect a territory\nhalf its size--hold it against even the 'Americans,' should they in\ntime feel strong enough to push their way across the western\nwilderness.  It is the destiny of this charming Arcadia to disappear;\nand did Russia forego an opportunity to appropriate a domain that\noffers her literally everything except civilization, she would be\nunworthy of her place among nations.  Moreover--a beneficent triumph\nimpossible to us otherwise--with a powerful and flourishing colony up\nand down this coast, and sending breadstuffs regularly to our other\npossessions in these waters until the natives, immigrants, and exiles\nwere healthy, vitalized beings, it would be but a question of a few\nyears before we should force open the doors of China and Japan.\"  He\ncaught Concha from her horse and strained her to him in the mounting\nardor of his plunge down the future.  \"You must resent nothing!\" he\ncried.  \"You must cease to be a Spanish woman when you become my wife,\nand help me as only you can in those inevitable years I have mapped\nout; and not so much for myself as for Russia.  My enemies have sought\nto persuade three sovereigns that I am a visionary, but I have already\naccomplished much that met with resentment and ridicule when I broached\nit.  And I know my powers!  I tingle with the knowledge of my ability\nto carry to a conclusion every plan I have thought worth the holding\nwhen the ardor of conception was over.  I swear to you that death\nalone--and I believe that nothing is further aloof--shall prevent my\ngiving this country to Russia before five years have passed, and within\nanother brief span the trade of China and Japan.  It is a glorious\ndestiny for a man--one man!--to pass into history as the Russian of his\ncentury who has done most to add to the extent and the wealth and the\npower of his empire!  Does that sound vainglorious, and do you resent\nit?  You must not, I tell you, you must not!\"\n\nConcha had never seen him in such a mood.  Although he held her so\nclosely that the horses were angrily biting each other, she felt that\nfor once there was nothing personal in his ardor.  His eyes were\nblazing, but they stared as if a great and prophetic panorama had risen\nin this silent wood, where the long faded moss hung as motionless as if\nby those quiet waters that even the most ardent must cross in his time.\nShe felt his heart beat as she had felt it before against her soft\nbreast, but she knew that if he thought of her at all it was but as a\npart of himself, not as the woman he impatiently desired. But she was\nsensible of no resentment, either for herself or her race, which,\nindeed, she knew to be but a wayfarer in the wilderness engaged in a\nbrief chimerical enterprise.  For the first time she felt her\nindividuality melt into, commingle with his: and when he lowered his\ngaze, still with that intensity of vision piercing the future, her own\neyes reflected the impersonalities of his; and in time he saw it.\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\"We should all wear black for so mournful an occasion,\" said Rafaella\nSal, spreading out her scarlet skirts.\n\n\"Father Abella is right.  The occasion is sad enough without giving it\nthe air of a funeral.\"\n\n\"Sad!  Dios de mi alma!  Will he return?\"\n\nElena Castro shook her wise head.  She was nearly twenty, and four\nyears of matrimony had made her sceptical of man's capacity for\nromance. \"Two years are long, and he will see many girls, and become\none again of a life that is always more brilliant than our sun in May.\nHis eyes will be dazzled, his mind distracted, full to the brim.  To\nsit at table with the Tsar, to talk with him alone in his cabinet, to\nhave for the asking audience of the Pope of Rome and the King of Spain!\nAy yi!  Ay yi!  Perhaps he will be made a prince when he returns to St.\nPetersburg and all the beautiful princesses will want to marry him.\nCan he remember this poor little California, and even our lovely\nConcha?  I doubt!  Valgame Dios, I doubt!\"\n\n\"Concha has always been too fortunate,\" said Rafaella with a touch of\nspite, for years of waiting had tried her temper and the sun always\nfreckled her nose.  The flower of California stood on the corridor of\nthe Mission and before the church awaiting the guest of honor and his\nescort.  A mass was to be said in behalf of the departing guests; the\nJuno would sail with the turn of the afternoon tide. Men and women were\nin their gayest finery, an exotic mass of color against the rough\nwhite-washed walls, chattering as vivaciously as if the burden of their\nconversation were not regret for the Chamberlain and his gay young\nlieutenants.  Concha, alone, wore no color; her frock was white, her\nmantilla black.  She stood somewhat apart, but although she was pale\nshe commanded her eyes to dwell absently on the shifting sand far down\nthe valley, her haughty Spanish profile betraying nothing of the\ndespair in her soul.\n\n\"Yes, Concha has always been too fortunate,\" repeated Rafaella.  \"Why\nshould she be chosen for such a destiny--to go to the Russian court and\nwear a train ten yards long of red velvet embroidered with gold, a\nwhite veil spangled with gold, a headdress a foot high set so thick\nwith jewels her head will ache for a week--Madre de Dios!  And we stay\nhere forever with white walls, horsehair furniture, Baja California\npearls and three silk dresses a year!\"\n\n\"No one in all Russia will look so grand in court dress as our\nConchita,\" said Elena loyally.  \"But I doubt if it is the dress and the\nstate she thinks of losing to-day.  She will not talk even to me of\nhim--  Ay yi! she grows more reserved every day, our Concha!--except to\nsay she will wed him when he returns, and that I know, for did not I\nwitness the betrothal?  She only mocks me when I beg her to tell me if\nshe loves him, languishes, or sings a bar of some one of our beautiful\nsongs with ridiculous words.  But she does.  She did not sleep last\nnight.  Her room is next to mine.  No, it is of Rezanov she thinks, and\nalways.  Those proud, silent girls, who jest when others would weep and\nuse many words and must die without sympathy--they have tragedy in\ntheir souls, ay yi!  And you think she is fortunate?  True she is\nbeautiful, she is La Favorita, she receives many boxes from Mexico, and\nshe has won the love of this Russian. But--I have not dared to remind\nher--I remembered it only yesterday--she came into this world on the\nthirteenth of a month, and he into her life but one day before the\nthirteenth of another--new style! True some might say that it was an\nescape, but if he came on the twelfth, it was on the thirteenth she\nbegan to love him--on the night of the ball; of that I am sure.\"\n\nRafaella shuddered and crossed herself.  \"Poor Concha!  Perhaps in the\nend she will always stand apart like that.  Truly she is not as others.\nI have always said it.  Thanks be to Mary it was Luis that wooed me,\nnot the Russian, for I might have been tempted.  True his eyes are\nblue, and only the black could win my heart.  But the court of St.\nPetersburg!  Dios de mi vida!  Did I lie awake at night and think of\nConcha Arguello in red velvet and jewels all over, I should hate her.\nBut no--to-day--I cannot.  Two years!  Have I not waited six?  It is\neternity when one loves and is young.\"\n\n\"They come,\" said Elena.\n\nThe cavalcade was descending the sand hills on the left, Rezanov in\nfull uniform between the Commandante and Luis Arguello and followed by\na picked escort of officers from Presidio and Fort. The Californians\nwore full-dress uniform of white and scarlet, Don Jose a blue velvet\nserape, embroidered in gold with the arms of Spain.\n\nAs they dismounted Rezanov bowed ceremoniously to the party on the\ncorridor, and they returned his salutation gravely, suddenly silent.\nHe walked directly over to Concha.\n\n\"We will go in together,\" he said.  \"It matters nothing what they\nthink.  I kneel beside no one else.\"\n\nAnd Concha, with the air of leading an honored guest to the banquet,\nturned and walked with him into the dark little church.\n\n\"Why did you not wear a white mantilla?\" he whispered.  \"I do not like\nthat black thing.\"\n\n\"I am not a bride.  I knew we should kneel together--it would have been\nridiculous.  And I could not wear a colored reboso to-day.\"\n\n\"I should have liked to fancy we were here for our nuptials.  Delusions\npass but are none the less sweet for that.\"\n\nThey knelt before the altar, the Commandante, Dona Ignacia, Luis,\nSantiago, Rafaella Sal and Elena Castro just behind; the rest of the\nparty, their bright garments shimmering vaguely in the gloom, as they\nlistened; and enough fervent prayers went up to insure the health and\nsafety of the departing guests for all their lives.\n\nRezanov, who had much on his mind, stared moodily at the altar until\nConcha, who had bowed her head almost to her knees, finished her\nsupplication; then their eyes turned and met simultaneously.  For a\nmoment their brains did swim in the delusion that the priest with his\nuplifted hands pronounced benediction upon their nuptials, that\nprobation was over and union nigh.  But Father Abella dismissed all\nwith the same blessing, and they shivered as they rose and walked\nslowly down the church.\n\nDona Ignacia took her husband's arm, and muttering that she feared a\nchill, hurried the others before her.  The priests had gone to the\nsacristy. Before they reached the door Rezanov and Concha were alone.\n\nHis hands fell heavily on her shoulders.\n\n\"Concha,\" he said, \"I shall come back if I live.  I make no foolish\nvows, so idle between us.  There is only one power that can prevent our\nmarriage in this church not later than two years from to-day. And\nalthough I am in the very fulness of my health and strength, with my\nwork but begun, and all my happiness in the future, and even to a less\nsanguine man it would seem that his course had many years to run, still\nhave I seen as much as any man of the inconsequence of life, of the\ninsignificance of the individual, his hopes, ambitions, happiness, and\neven usefulness, in the complicated machinery of natural laws.  It may\nbe that I shall not come back.  But I wish to take with me your promise\nthat if I have not returned at the end of two years or you have\nreceived no reason for my detention, you will believe that I am dead.\nThere would be but one insupportable drop in the bitterness of death,\nthe doubt of your faith in my word and my love.  Are you too much of a\nwoman to curb your imagination in a long unbroken silence?\"\n\n\"I have learned so much that one lesson more is no tax on my faith.\nAnd I no longer live in a world of little things.  I promise you that I\nshall never falter nor doubt.\"\n\nHe bent his head and kissed her for the first time without passion, but\nsolemnly, as had their nuptials indeed been accomplished, and the\ngreater mystery of spiritual union isolated them for a moment in that\ntwilight region where the mortal part did not enter.\n\nAs they left the church they saw that all the Indians of the Mission\nand neighborhood, in a gala of color, had gathered to cheer the\nRussians as they rode away.  Concha was to return as she had come,\nbeside the carreta of her mother, and as Rezanov mounted his horse she\nstood staring with unseeing eyes on the brilliant, animated scene.\nSuddenly she heard a suppressed sob, and felt a touch on her skirt.\nShe looked round and saw Rosa, kneeling close to the church.  For a\nmoment she continued to stare, hardly comprehending, in the intense\nconcentration of her faculties, that tangible beings, other than\nherself and Rezanov, still moved on the earth.  Then her mind relaxed.\nShe was normal in a normal world once more.  She stooped and patted the\nhands clasping her skirts.\n\n\"Poor Rosa!\" she said.  \"Poor Rosa!\"\n\n\nOver the intense green of islands and hills were long banners of yellow\nand purple mist, where the wild flowers were lifting their heads.  The\nwhole quivering bay was as green as the land, but far away the\nmountains of the east were pink.  Where there was a patch of verdure on\nthe sand hills the warm golden red of the poppy flaunted in the\nsunshine.  All nature was in gala attire like the Californians\nthemselves, as the Juno under full sail sped through \"The Mouth of the\nGulf of the Farallones.\"  Fort San Joaquin saluted with seven guns; the\nJuno returned the compliment with nine.  The Commandante, his family\nand guests, stood on the hill above the fort, cheering, waving\nsombreros and handkerchiefs.  Wind and tide carried the ship rapidly\nout the straits.  Rezanov dropped the cocked hat he had been waving and\nraised his field-glass.  Concha, as ever, stood a little apart.  As the\nship grew smaller and the company turned toward the Presidio, she\nadvanced to the edge of the bluff.  The wind lifted her loosened\nmantilla, billowing it out on one side, and as she stood with her hands\npressed against her heart, she might, save for her empty arms, have\nbeen the eidolon of the Madonna di San Sisto.  In her eyes was the same\nexpression of vague arrested horror as she looked out on that world of\nmenacing imperfections the blind forces of nature and man had created;\nher body was instinct with the same nervous leashed impotent energy.\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nThe white rain clouds, rolling as ever like a nervous intruder over the\ngreat snow peaks behind the steep hills black with forest that rose\nlike a wall back of the little settlement of Sitka, parted for a\nmoment, and the sun, a coy disdainful guest, flung a glittering mist\nover what Nature had intended to be one of the most enchanting spots on\nearth, until, in a fit of ill-temper--with one of the gods, no\ndoubt--she gave it to Niobe as a permanent outlet for her discontent.\nWhen it does not rain at Sitka it pours, and when once in a way she\ndraws a deep breath of respite and lifts her grand and glorious face to\nthe sun, in pathetic gratitude for dear infrequent favor, comes a wild\nflurry of snow or a close white fog from the inland waters; and, like a\ngreat beauty condemned to wear a veil through life, she can but stare\nin dumb resentment through the folds, consoling herself with the\nknowledge that could the world but see it must surely worship.\nPerhaps, who knows? she really is a frozen goddess, condemned to the\nveil for infidelity to him imprisoned in the great volcano across the\nsound--who sends up a column of light once in a way to dazzle her\nshrouded eyes, and failing that batters her with rock and stone like\nany lover of the slums.  One day he spat forth a rock like a small\nhill, and big enough to dominate the strip of lowland at least,\nstanding out on the edge of the island like a guard at the gates, and\nnever a part of the alien surface.  Between this lofty rock and the\nforest was the walled settlement of New Archangel, that Baranhov, the\ndauntless, had wrested from the bloodthirsty Kolosh but a short time\nsince and purposed to hold in the interest of the Russian-American\nCompany.  His log hut, painted like the other buildings with a yellow\nochre found in the soil, stood on the rock, and his glass swept the\nforest as often as the sea.\n\nAs Rezanov, on the second of July, thirty-one days after leaving San\nFrancisco, sailed into the harbor with its hundred bits of volcanic\nwoodland weeping as ever, he gave a whimsical sigh in tribute to the\ngay and ever-changing beauties of the southern land, but was in no mood\nfor sentimental reminiscence.  Natives, paddling eagerly out to sea in\ntheir bidarkas to be the first to bring in good news or bad, had given\nhim a report covering the period of his absence that filled him with\ndismay. There had been deaths from scurvy; one of the largest ships\nbelonging to the Company had been wrecked and the entire cargo lost; of\na hunting party of three hundred Aleuts in one hundred and forty\nbidarkas, which had gone from Sitka to Kadiak in November of the\npreceding year, not one had arrived at its destination, and there was\nreason to believe that all had been drowned or massacred; and the\nRussians and Aleuts at Behring's Bay settlement had been exterminated\nby one of the native tribes.\n\nBut the Juno was received with salvos of artillery from the fort, and\ncheered by the entire population of the settlement, crowded on the\nbeach. Baranhov, looking like a monkey with a mummy's head in which\nonly a pair of incomparably shrewd eyes still lived, his black wig\nfastened on his bald, red-fringed pate with a silk handkerchief tied\nunder his chin, stood, hands on hips, shaking with excitement and\ndelight.  The bearded, long-haired priests, in full canonicals of black\nand gold, were beside the Chief-Manager, ready to escort the\nChamberlain to the chapel at the head of the solitary street, where the\nbells were pealing and a mass of thanksgiving was to be said for his\nsafe return.\n\nBut it was some time before Rezanov could reach the chapel or even\nexchange salutations with Baranhov.  As he stepped on shore he was\nsurrounded, almost hustled by the shouting crowd of Russians,--many of\nthem convicts--Aleuts and Sitkans, who knelt at his feet, endeavored to\nkiss his hand, his garments, in their hysterical gratitude for the food\nhe had brought them.  For the first time he felt reconciled to his\ndeparture from California, and Concha's image faded as he looked at the\ntearful faces of the diseased, ill-nourished wretches who gave their\nmite of life that he might live as became a great noble of the Russian\nEmpire.  But although he tingled with pleasure and was deeply moved, he\nby no means swelled with vanity, for he was far too clear-sighted to\ndoubt he had done more than his duty, or that his duty was more than\nbegun. He made them a little speech, giving his word they should be\nproperly fed hereafter, that he would make the improvement of their\ncondition as well as that of all the employees of the Company\nthroughout this vast chain of settlements on the Pacific, the chief\nconsideration of his life; and they believed him and followed him to\nthe chapel rejoicing, reconciled for once to their lot.\n\nAfter the service Rezanov went up to the hut of the Chief-Manager, a\nhabitation that leaked winter and summer, and was equally deficient in\nlight, ventilation and order.  But Baranhov in the sixteen years of his\nexile had forgotten the bare lineaments of comfort, and devoted his\ndays to advancing the interests of the Company, his nights, save when\nsleep overcame him, to potations that would have buried an ordinary man\nunder Alaskan snows long since.  But Baranhov had fourteen years more\nof good service in him, and rescued the Company from insolvency again\nand again, nor ever played into the hands of marauding foreigners; with\nbrain on fire he was shrewder than the soberest.\n\nHe listened with deep satisfaction to the Chamberlain's account of his\nsuccess with the Californians and his glowing pictures of the country,\nnodding every few moments with emphatic approval. But as the story\nfinished his wonderful eyes were two bubbling springs of humor, and\nRezanov, who knew him well, recrossed his legs nervously.\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked.  \"What have I done now?  Remember that you have\nbeen in this business for sixteen years, and I one--\"\n\n\"How many measures of corn did you say you had brought, Excellency?\"\n\n\"Two hundred and ninety-four,\" replied Rezanov proudly.\n\n\"A provision that exceeds my most sanguine hopes.  The only thing that\nmitigates my satisfaction is that there is not a mill in the settlement\nto grind it.\"\n\nRezanov sprang to his feet with a violent exclamation, his face very\nred.  There was no one whose good opinion he valued as he did that of\nthis brilliant, dissipated, disinterested old genius; and he felt like\na schoolboy.  But although he started for the door, he recovered\nhalf-way, and reseating himself joined in the laughter of the little\nman who was rocking back and forth on his bench, his weazened leg\nclasped against his shrunken chest.\n\n\"How on earth was I to know all your domestic arrangements?\" he said\ntestily.  \"God knows I found them limited enough last winter, but it\nnever occurred to me there was any mysterious process involved in\nconverting corn into meal.  Is it quite useless, then?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, we can boil or roast it.  It will dispose of what teeth we\nhave left, but that will serve the good purpose of reminding us always\nof your excellency's interest in our welfare.\"\n\nRezanov shrugged his shoulders.  \"Give the corn to the natives.  It is\nfarinaceous at all events.  And you can have nothing to say against the\nflour I have brought, and the peas, beans, tallow, butter, barley,\nsalt, and salted meats--in all to the value of twenty-four thousand\nSpanish dollars.\"\n\nThe Chief-Manager's head nodded with the vigor and rapidity of a\nmechanical toy.  \"It is a God-send, a God-send.  If you did no more\nthan that you would have earned our everlasting gratitude.  It will\nmake us over, give us renewed courage in this cursed existence.  Are\nyou not going to get me out of it?\"\n\nRezanov shook his head with a smile.  \"Literally you are the whole\nCompany.  As long as I live here you stay--although when I reach St.\nPetersburg I shall see that you receive every possible reward and\nhonor.\"\n\nBaranhov lifted his shoulders to his ears in quizzical resignation.  \"I\nsuppose it matters little where the last few years left me are spent,\nand I can hang the medals on the walls to console me when I have\nrheumatism, and shout my titles from the top of the fort when the\nKolosh are yelling at the barricades.\"\n\n\"You must make yourself more comfortable,\" said Rezanov emphatically.\n\"You are wrong to carry your honesty and enthusiasm to the point of\nliving like the promuschleniki.  Take enough of their time to build you\na comfortable dwelling, and I will send you, on my own account, far\nmore substantial rewards than orders and titles.  Build a big house,\nfor that matter.  I shall be here more or less--when I am not in\nCalifornia.\"  And he told Baranhov of his proposed marriage with the\ndaughter of Don Jose Arguello.\n\nThe Chief-Manager listened to this confidence with an even livelier\nsatisfaction than to the list of the Juno's cargo.\n\n\"We shall have California yet!\" he cried, his eyes snapping like live\ncoals under the black thatch of wig.  \"Absorption or the bayonet.  It\nmatters little. Ten years from now and we shall have a line of\nsettlements as far south as San Diego.  My plan was to feel my way down\nthe northern coast of California with a colony, which should buy a\ntract of land from the natives and engage immediately in otter\nhunting--somewhere between Cape Mendocino and Drake's Bay.  The Spanish\nhave no settlements above San Francisco and are too weak to drive us\nout.  They would rage and bluster and do nothing.  Then quietly push\nforward, building forts and ships.  But you have taken hold in the\ngrand manner and will accomplish in ten years what would have taken me\nfifty.  Marry this girl, use your advantage over the entire\nfamily--whose influence I well know--and that great personal power with\nwhich the Almighty has been so lavish, and you will have the whole\nweakly garrisoned country under your foot before they know where they\nare, and the Russian settlers pouring in.  Spain cannot come to the\nrescue while this devil Bonaparte is alive, and he is young, and like\nyourself a favorite of destiny.  Those damned Bostonians inherit the\ngrabbing instincts of the too paternal race they have just rejected,\nbut there are thousands of miles of desert between California and their\nown western outposts, hundreds of savage tribes to exterminate. By the\ntime they are in a position to attempt the occupation of California we\nshall be so securely entrenched they will either let us alone or send\ntroops that would be half dead by the time they reach us.  As to ships,\nwe could soon build enough at Okhotsk and Petropaulovsky for our\npurpose.  For the matter of that, if your gifted tongue impressed the\nTsar with the riches of California there would always be war ships on\nher coast.\"  He leaned forward and caught the strong shoulders above\nhim in hands that looked like a tangle of baked nerves, and shook them\nvigorously.  \"You are a great boy!\" he said with a sort of quizzical\nsolemnity.  \"A great boy.  This damned, God-forsaken, pestilential,\ndemoralizing, brutalizing factory for enriching a few with the very\nlife blood and vitals of thousands that will suffer and starve and\nnever be heard of\" (all his language cannot be recorded), \"will make\ntwo or three reputations by the way.  Mine will be one, although I'll\nget nothing else.  Shelikov is safe; but you will have a monument.\nWell, God bless you.  I grudge you nothing.  Not even the happiness you\ndeserve and are bound to have--for when all is said and done, Rezanov,\nyou are a lucky dog, a lucky dog!  Any man may see that, even when\nthese infernal snows have left him with but half an eye.  To quarrel\nwith a destiny like yours would be as great a waste of time as to\nprotest that California is warm and fertile, while this infernal North\nis like living in a refrigerator with the deluge to vary the monotony.\nNow let us get drunk!\"\n\nBut Rezanov laughingly extricated himself, and sending a message to\nDavidov and Khostov to come to him immediately, walked toward the tent\nhe had ordered erected on the edge of the settlement; only the worst of\nweather drove him indoors in these half-civilized communities.\n\nAs he was passing the chapel, followed again by the employees of the\nCompany, to whom he had granted a holiday, he suddenly found his hand\ntaken possession of, and looked up to see himself confronted by a\ndissipated-looking person in plain clothes.  His hand became so limp\nthat it was dropped as if it had put forth a sting, and he narrowed his\neyes and demanded with a bend of his mouth that brought the blood to\nthe face of the intruder:\n\n\"And who are you, may I ask?\"\n\nThe man threw back his head defiantly.  \"I am Lieutenant Sookin of the\nImperial Navy of Russia,\" he said in a loud, defiant tone.\n\n\"And I am Chamberlain of the Russian Court and Commander of all\nAmerica,\" replied Rezanov coolly.  \"Now go to your quarters, dress\nyourself in your uniform, and present your report to me an hour hence.\"\n\nThe officer, concentrating in his injected eyes all the lively hatred\nand jealousy of his service for the Russian-American Company in this\nregion where it reigned supreme and cared no more for the Admiralty\nthan for some native chieftain covered with shells and warpaint, glared\nat its plenipotentiary as if calling upon his deeper resources of\ninsolence; but the steady, contemptuous gaze of the man who had dealt\nwith his kind often and successfully overcame his sodden spirit, and he\nturned sulkily and slouched off to his quarters to console himself with\nmore brandy.  Rezanov shrugged his shoulders and went on to his tent.\n\nThere was no furniture in it as yet, and he was obliged to receive\nDavidov and Khostov standing, but this he preferred.  They followed him\nalmost immediately, apprehensive and nervous, and before speaking he\nlooked at them for a moment with his strong, penetrating gaze.  He well\nknew the power of his own personality, and that it was immeasurably\nenhanced by the fact that of all with whom he had to do in these\nbenighted regions his will alone was never weakened by liquor.  These\nyoung men, clever, high-bred, with an honorable record not only in\nRussia, but in England and America, looked upon a hilarious night as\nthe just reward of work well done by day.  Brandy was debited to their\naccount by the \"bucket\" (a bucket being a trifle less than two\ngallons), and they found little fault with life. But the profligacy\ngave a commanding spirit like Rezanov's an advantage which they did not\nunder-estimate for a moment; and they alternately hated and worshiped\nhim.\n\n\"I think you have an inkling of what I am going to ask you to do.\"  The\nChamberlain brought out the euphemism with the utmost suavity.  \"I have\nmade up my mind not to ignore the indignity to which Russia was\nsubjected last year by Japan, but to inflict upon it such punishment as\nI find it in my power to compass.  It was my intention to build a\nflotilla here, but owing to the diseased condition and reduced numbers\nof the employees, that was impossible, and I shall be obliged to\ncontent myself with the Juno and the Avos, whose keel, as you know, was\nlaid in November, and is no doubt finished long since.  These I shall\nfit with armaments in Okhotsk.  I shall place the enterprise I have\nspoken of in your charge, sailing with you from Sitka five days hence.\nFrom Okhotsk I desire that you proceed to the Japanese settlements in\nthe lower Kurile Islands, take possession of them and bring all stores\nand as many of the inhabitants as the vessels will accommodate, to\nSitka, where Baranhov will see that they are comfortably established on\nthat large island in the harbor--which we shall call Japonsky--and\nconverted into good servants of the Company.  The excuse for this\nenterprise is that those islands were formally taken possession of by\nShelikov; and although abandoned later, the fact remains that the\nRussian flag was the first to float over them.  The stores captured may\nnot be worth much and the islands are of no particular use to us, but\nit is wise that Japan should have a taste of Russian power; and the\nconsequences may be salutary in more ways than one.  I hope you will do\nme this great favor, for there is no one of your tried probity and\nskill to whom I can trust so delicate an enterprise.  I am doing it\nwholly upon my own responsibility, for although I wrote tentatively to\nthe Tsar on this subject before I sailed for California, it is not yet\ntime for a reply.  However, I take the consequences upon my own\nshoulders.  You shall not suffer in any way, for your orders are to\nobey mine while you remain in these waters.\"\n\nHe paused a moment, and then suddenly smiled into the unresponsive\nfaces before him.  He held out his hand and shook their limp ones\nwarmly.\n\n\"Let me thank you here for all your inestimable services in the past,\nand particularly during our late hazardous voyages.  Be sure that\nwhether you succeed in this enterprise or not, your rewards shall be no\nless for what you have already done.  I shall make it a personal matter\nwith the Tsar.  You shall have promotion and a substantial increase in\npay, besides the orders and Imperial thanks you so richly deserve.\nLest anything happen to me on my homeward journey, I shall write to St.\nPetersburg before I leave.\"\n\nThe lieutenants, overcome as ever when he chose to put forth his full\npowers, assured him of their fidelity and, if with misgivings, vowed to\nmete out vengeance to the Japanese.  And although their misgivings were\nnot unfounded, and they paid a high price in suffering and\nmortification, they accomplished their object and in due course\nreceived the rewards the Chamberlain had promised them.\n\nThey did not retire, and Rezanov, noting their sudden hesitation and\nembarrassment, felt an instant thrill of apprehension.\n\n\"What is it?\" he demanded.  \"What has happened?\"\n\n\"Life has moved slowly in Sitka during your absence, Excellency,\"\nreplied Davidov.  \"There has been little work done on the Avos.  It\nwill not be finished for a month or six weeks.\"\n\nThen, had the young men been possessed by a not infrequent mood, they\nwould have glowed with a sense of just satisfaction.  Rezanov felt\nhimself turn so white that he wheeled about and left the tent.  A month\nor six weeks!  And the speed and safety of his journey across Siberia\ndepended upon his making the greater part of it before the heavy autumn\nrains swelled the rivers and flooded the swamps.  Winter or summer the\njourney from Okhotsk to St. Petersburg might be made in four months;\nwith the wealth and influence at his command, possibly in less; but in\nthe deluge between he was liable to detentions lasting nearly as long\nagain, to say nothing of illness caused by inevitable exposure.\n\nHe stood staring at the palisades for many minutes.  The separation\nmust be long enough, the dangers numerous enough if he started within\nthe week, but at least he had in a measure accustomed himself to the\nidea of not seeing Concha again for \"the best part of two years,\" and\nthe sanguineness of his temperament had led him to hope that the time\nmight be reduced to eighteen months.  If he delayed too long, only by\nmeans of an unprecedented run of good fortune would he reach St.\nPetersburg but a month behind his calculations. And the chances were in\nfavor of four, or three at the best!  Never since the morning that the\nreal nature of his feeling for Concha had declared itself had he\nyearned toward her as at that moment; never since the dictum of what\nshe called their \"tribunal\" had he so rebelled against the long delay.\nAnd yet he hesitated.  To leave Japan unpunished for the senseless\nhumiliations to which it had subjected Russia in his person was not to\nbe thought of, and yet did he leave without seeing the Avos finished,\nthe two boats supplied with armaments at Okhotsk, and under way before\nhe started across Siberia, he knew it was doubtful if the expedition\ntook place before his return; in that case might never take place, for\nthese two young men might have drifted elsewhere, and he knew no one\nelse to whom he could entrust such a commission.  In spite of their\nidiosyncrasies he could rely upon them implicitly--up to a certain\npoint.  That point involved keeping them in sight until exactly the\nright moment and leaving nothing to their executive which could be\ncertainly accomplished by himself alone.  Did he sail five days hence\non the Juno one of the officers would be exposed for an indeterminate\ntime to the temptations of Okhotsk, the ship, perhaps, at the mercy of\nsome sudden requirement of the Company.  His authority was absolute\nwhen enforced in person, but it was a proverb west of the Ural: \"God\nreigns and the Tsar is far away.\"  If the Juno were wanted the manager\nof Okhotsk would argue that two years was a period in which an ardent\nservant of the Company would find many an excuse to justify its seizure.\n\nAnd here in Sitka it was doubtful if the work on the Avos proceeded at\nall.  Baranhov was not in sympathy with the enterprise against the\nJapanese, fearing the consequences to himself in the event of the\nTsar's disapproval, and resenting the impressment of the promuschleniki\ninto a service that deprived him of their legitimate work.  Moreover,\nalthough he loved Rezanov personally, he had enjoyed supreme power in\nthe wilderness too long not to chafe under even the temporary\nassumption of authority by his high-handed superior.  With the best of\nintentions Davidov could make little headway against the passive\nresistance of the Chief-Manager, and those intentions would be weakened\nby the consolidations the Company so generously afforded.\n\nThe result was hardly open to doubt.  If he left Sitka before the\ncompletion of the Avos, Russia would go unavenged for the present.  Or\nhimself? Rezanov, sanguine and imaginative as he was, even to the point\nof creating premises to rhyme with ends, was very honest fundamentally.\nHe turned abruptly on his heel, and calling to the officers that he\nwould announce his decision on the morrow, ordered the sentry to open\nthe gate and passed out of the enclosure.\n\nHe crossed the clearing and entered the forest. The warlike tribes\nthemselves had trodden paths through the dense undergrowth of young\ntrees and ferns.  Rezanov, despite Baranhov's warning, had tramped the\nforest many times.  It was the one thing that reconciled him to Sitka,\nfor there are few woods more beautiful.  In spite or because of the\nincessant rains, it is pervaded by a rich golden gloom, the result of\nthe constant rotting of the brown and yellow bark, not only of the\nprostrate trees, but of the many killed by crowding and unable to seek\nthe earth with the natural instinct of death.  And above, the green of\nhemlock and spruce was perennially fresh and young, glistening and\nfragrant.  Here and there was a small clearing where the clans had\nerected their ingenious and hideous totem poles, out of place in the\nancient beauty of the wood.\n\nThe ferns brushed his waist, the roar of the river came to his ears,\nthe forest had never looked more primeval, more wooing to a man\nburdened with civilization, but Rezanov gave it less heed than usual,\nalthough he had turned to it instinctively.  He was occupied with a\nquestion to which nature would turn an aloof disdainful ear.  Was his\nown wounded vanity at the root of his desire to humiliate Japan? Russia\nwas too powerful, too occupied, for the present at least, greatly to\ncare that her overtures and presents had been scorned.  Upon her\nambassador had fallen the full brunt of that wearisome and incomparably\nmortifying experience, and unfortunately the ambassador happened to be\none of the proudest and most autocratic men in her empire. No man of\nRezanov's caliber but accommodates that sort of personal vanity that\ntenaciously resents a blow to the pride of which it is a part, to the\nlove of power it feeds.  As well expect a lover without passion, a\nstate without corruption.  Rezanov finally shrugged his shoulders and\nadmitted the impeachment, but at the same time he recognized that the\ndesire for vengeance still held, and that the tenacity of his nature, a\ntenacity that had been no mean factor in the remodeling of himself from\na voluptuous young sprig of nobility into one of the most successful\nbusiness men and subjugator of other men that the Russian Empire could\nshow, was not likely to weaken when its very roots had been stiff with\npurpose for fifteen months.  Power had been Rezanov's ruling passion\nfor many years before he met Concha Arguello, and, although it might\nmate very comfortably with love, it was not to be expected that it\nwould remain submerged beyond the first enthusiasm, nor even assume the\nposition of the \"party of the second part.\"  Rezanov was Rezanov. He\nwas also in that interval between youth and age when the brain rules if\nit is ever to rule at all.  That the ardor of his nature had awakened\nrefreshed after a long sleep was but just proved, as well as the\nrevival of his early ideals and capacity for genuine love; but the\ncomplexities, the manifold interests and desires of the ego had been\ngrowing and developing these many years; and no mere mortal that has\ngiven up his life for a considerable period to the thirst for dominance\ncan ever, save in a brief exaltation, sacrifice it to anything so\nnormal as the demands of sex and spirit.  For good or ill, the man who\nhas burned with ambition, exulted in the exercise of power, bitterly\nresented the temporary victories of rivals and enemies, fought with all\nthe resources of brain and character against failure, is in a class\napart from humanity in the mass.  Rezanov loved Concha Arguello to the\nvery depths of his soul, but he had lived beyond the time when even she\ncould engage successfully with the ruthless forces that had molded into\nimmutable shape the Rezanov she knew.  Her place was second, and it is\nprobable that she would have loved him less had it been otherwise; she,\nin spite of her fine intellect and strong will, being all woman, as he,\ndespite his depth of intuition, was all man.  Equality is possible in\nno relation or condition of life.  When woman subjugates man the\nconquered will enjoy a sense of revenge proportionate to the meanness\nof his state.\n\nIt is possible that had Concha awaited Rezanov in St. Petersburg her\nattraction would have focused his desires irresistibly; but his mind\nhad resigned itself to the prospect of separation for a definite\nperiod, and while it had not relegated her image to the background, her\npart in his life had been settled there among many future\npossibilities, and all the foreground was crowded with the impatient\nsymbols of the intervening time.  Moreover, he well knew that the savor\nwould be gone from his happiness with the woman were the taste of\nanother failure acrid in his mouth.\n\nAs he realized that the die was cast, the sanguineness of his\ntemperament rushed to do battle against apprehension and self-accusing.\nAfter all, he was rarely balked of his way, accustomed to ride down\nobstacles, to the amiable cooperation of fate.  He could arrive in\nOkhotsk late in September or early in October.  Captain D'Wolf, who had\nbeen detained at Sitka during his absence by the same indifference that\nhad operated against the completion of the Avos, would precede him and\norder that all be in readiness at Okhotsk both for the ships and his\njourney to Yakutsk.  He could proceed at once; and, no doubt, with\ntwice the number or horses needed, would make the first and most\ndifficult stage of the journey in the usual time, and with no great\nembarrassment from the rains.  From Yakutsk to Irkutsk the greater part\nof the travel was by water in any case, and after that the land was\nflat for the most part and bridges were more numerous.  The governor of\nevery town in Siberia would be his obsequious servant, the entire\nresources of the country would be at his disposal.  He was sound in\nhealth again, as resistant against hardships as when he had sailed from\nKronstadt.  And God knew, he thought with a sigh, his will and purpose\nhad never been stronger.\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nRezanov disembarked from the Juno at Okhotsk during the first days of\nOctober.  Had it not been for a touch of fever that had returned in the\nfilth and warm dampness of Sitka, he would have felt almost as buoyant\nin mind and body as in those days when California had gone to his head.\nThe Juno had touched at Kadiak, Oonalaska, and others of the more\nimportant settlements, and he had found his schools and libraries in\ngood condition, seals and otters rapidly increasing, in their immunity\nfrom indiscriminate slaughter, new and stronger forts threatening the\nnefarious Bostonian and Briton.  At Okhotsk he learned that the embassy\nof Count Golofkin to China had failed as signally as his own, and this\nalone would have put him in the best of tempers even had he not found\nhis armament and caravan awaiting him, facilitating his immediate\ndeparture.  He wrote a gay letter to Concha, giving her the painful\nstory of the naturalist attached to the Golofkin embassy, Dr. Redovsky,\nwho had remained in the East animated by the same scientific enthusiasm\nas that of his colleague, the good Langsdorff; parted some time since\nfrom his too exacting master.  Rezanov had written Concha many letters\nduring his detention in Sitka, and left them with Baranhov to send at\nthe first opportunity.  The Chief-Manager, deeply interested in the\nromance of the mighty Chamberlain with whom he alone dared to take a\nliberty, vowed to guard all that came to his care and sooner or later\nto send them to California.  Rezanov had also written comprehensively\nto the Tsar and the directors of the Russian-American Company, adroitly\nplacing his marriage in the light of a diplomatic maneuver, and\npainting California in colors the more vivid and enticing for the\nsullen clouds and roaring winds, the dripping forests and eternal snows\nof that derelict corner of Earth where he had been stranded so long.\nHe had also, when Langsdorff announced his intention to start upon a\ndifficult journey in the interest of science, provided him not only\nwith letters of recommendation, but with all the comforts procurable in\na land where the word comfort was the stock in trade of the local\nsatirist.  But Langsdorff, although punctiliously acknowledging the\nfavors, never quite forgave the indifference of a mere ambassador and\nchamberlain, rejoicing in the dignity of an honorary membership in the\nSt. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, to the supreme division of natural\nhistory.\n\nThe first stage of the journey--from Okhotsk to Yakutsk--was about six\nhundred and fifty English miles, not as the crow flew, but over the\nStanovoi mountains in a southwesterly direction to the Maya, by this\nriver's wavering course to the Youdoma, then northwest to the Aldan,\nand south beside the Lena.  The beaten track lay entirely alongside the\nrivers at this season, upon their surface in winter; and in addition to\nthese great streams there were many too unimportant for the map, but as\nerratic in course and as irresistible in energy after the first rains\nof autumn.\n\nCaptain D'Wolf had proved himself capable and faithful, and a caravan\nof forty horses had been in Okhotsk a week; twenty for immediate use,\ntwenty for relief, or substitutes in almost certain emergency.  As\nthere were but one or two stations of any importance between Okhotsk\nand Yakutsk, and as a week might pass without the shelter of so much as\na hut, it was necessary to take tents and bearskin beds for the\nChamberlain, his Cossack guard, valet-de-chambre, cook and other\nservants, one set of fine blankets and linen, cooking utensils, axes,\narms, tinder-boxes, provisions for the entire trip, besides a great\nquantity of personal luggage.\n\nRezanov lost no time.  He had changed his original plan and dispatched\nDavidov on the Avos from Oonalaska.  Guns and provisions awaited the\nJuno at Okhotsk, and in less than a week after his arrival Rezanov was\nable to start on his long journey with a mind at rest.  Although the\nalmost extravagant delight that his body had taken in the comforts of\nhis manager's home, after ten weeks on the Juno, warned him that he\nmight be in a better condition to begin a journey of ten thousand\nversts, he hearkened neither to the hint nor to the insistence of his\nhost.  His impatient energy and stern will, combined with the\npassionate wish to accomplish the double object of his journey,\nreturning in the least possible time to California with his treaty and\nthe consent of the Pope and King to his marriage, would have carried\nhim out of Okhotsk in forty-eight hours had disease declared itself.\nNor were there any inducements aside from a comfortable bed and refined\nfare, in the flat, unhealthy town with its everlasting rattle of\nchains, and the hideous physiognomies of criminals always at work to\nthe rumbling accompaniment of Cossack oaths.\n\nFor the first week the exercise he loved best and the long days in the\ncrisp open air renewed his vigor, and he even looked forward to the\nfour months of what was then the severest traveling in the world, in a\nboyish spirit of adventure.  He reflected that he might as well give\nhis brain a relief from the constant revolving of schemes and plans for\nthe advancement of his country, his company, and himself, and let his\nthoughts have their carnival of anticipation with the unparalleled\nhappiness and success that awaited him in the future.  There was no\npossible doubt of the acquiescence and assistance of the Tsar, and no\nman ever looked down a fairer perspective than he, as he galloped over\nthe ugly country, often far ahead of his caravan, splashing through\nbogs and streams, fording rivers without ferries, camping at night in\nforests so dense the cold never escaped their embrace, muffled to the\neyes in furs as he made his way past valleys whose eternal ice fields\nchilled the country for miles about; sometimes able to procure a little\nfresh milk and butter, oftener not; occasionally passing a caravan\nreturning for furs, generally seeing nothing but a stray reindeer for\nhours together, once meeting the post and finding much for himself that\nin nowise dampened his spirit.\n\nBut on the eighth day the rains began: a fine steady mist, then in\ntorrents as endless.  Wrapped in bearskins at night within the shelter\nof a tent or of some wayside hut, and closely covered by day, Rezanov\nat first merely cursed the inconvenience of the rain; but while\ncrossing the river Allach Juni, his guides without consulting him\nhaving taken him miles out of his way in order to avoid the hamlet of\nthe same name where the small-pox was raging, but where there was a\ngovernment ferry, his horse lost his footing in the rapid, swollen\ncurrent and fell. Rezanov managed to retain his seat, and pulled the\nfrightened, plunging beast to its feet while his Cossacks were still\nshouting their consternation.  But he was soaked to the skin, his\npersonal luggage was in the same condition, and they did not reach a\nhut where a fire could be made until nine hours later. It was then that\nthe seeds of malaria, accumulated during the last three years in\nunsanitary ports and sown deep by exceptional hardships, but which he\nbelieved had taken themselves off during his six weeks in California,\nstirred more vigorously than in Sitka or Okhotsk.  He rode on the next\nday in a burning fever.  Jon, minding Langsdorff's instructions,\ndoctored him--not without difficulty--from the medicine chest, and for\na day or two the fever seemed broken.  But Jon, sick with apprehension,\nimplored him to turn back.  He might as well have implored the sky to\nturn blue.\n\n\"How do you think men accomplish things in this world?\" asked Rezanov\nangrily.  \"By turning back and going to bed every time they have a\nmigraine?\"\n\n\"No, Excellency,\" said the man humbly.  \"But health is necessary to the\naccomplishment of everything, and if the body is eaten up with fever--\"\n\n\"What are drugs for?  Give me the whole damned pharmacopeia if you\nchoose, but don't talk to me about turning back.\"\n\n\"Very well, Excellency,\" said Jon, with a sigh.\n\nThe next day he and one of the Cossack guard caught him as he fell from\nhis horse unconscious. A Yakhut hut, miserable as it was, offered in\nthe persistent downpour a better shelter than the tent. They carried\nhim into it, and his bedding at least was almost as luxurious as had he\nbeen in St. Petersburg.  Jon, at his wits' end, remembered the'\npractice of Langsdorff in similar cases, and used the lancet, a heroic\ntreatment he would never have accomplished had his master been\nconscious.  The fever ebbed, and in a few days Rezanov was able to\ncontinue the journey by shorter stages, although heavy with an\nintolerable lassitude.  But his will sustained him until he reached\nYakutsk, not at the end of twenty-two days, but of thirty-three.  Here\nhe succumbed immediately, and although his sickbed was in the\ncomfortable home of the agent of the Company, and he had medical\nattendance of a sort, his fever and convalescence lasted for eight\nweeks.  Then, in spite of the supplications of his friends, chief among\nwhom was his faithful Jon, and the prohibition of the doctor, he began\nthe second stage of his journey.\n\nThe road from Yakutsk to Irkutsk, some two thousand six hundred versts,\nor fifteen hundred and fifty English miles, lay for the most part\nalternately on and along the river Lena in a southeasterly direction;\nthere being no attempt to cross Siberia at any point in a straight\nline.  By this time the river was frozen, and the only concession\nRezanov would make to his enfeebled frame was an arrangement to cover\nthe entire journey by private sledge instead of employing the swifter\ncourse of post sledge on the long stretches and horseback on the\nshorter cuts.\n\nThe weather was now intensely cold, the river winding, the delays many,\nbut there were adequate stations for the benefit and accommodation of\ntravelers every hundred versts or less.  Rezanov felt so invigorated by\nthe long hours in the open after the barbarous closeness of his sick\nroom, that at the end of a fortnight he was again possessed with all\nhis old ardor of desire to reach the end of his journey.  He vowed he\nwas well again, abandoned his comfortable sledge, and pushed on in the\ncommon manner.  In the wretched post sledges he was often exposed to\nthe full violence of a Siberian winter, and although the horseback\nexercise stirred his blood and refreshed him for the moment, he\nsuffered in reaction and was several times forced to remain two nights\ninstead of one at a station.  But he was muffled in sables to his very\neyes, and the road was diverting, often beautiful, with its Gothic\nmountains, its white plains set with villages and farms, the high thin\ncrosses above the open or swelling domes of the little churches.\nSometimes the Lena narrowed until its frozen surface looked like a mass\nof ice that had ground its way between perpendicular walls or\noverhanging masses of rock that awaited the next convulsion of nature\nto close the pass altogether.  Then the dogs trotted past caves and\ngrottos, left the abrupt and craggy banks, crossed level plains once\nmore; where herds of cattle grazed in the summertime, now a vast\nuncheckered expanse of white.  The Government and Company agents fawned\nupon him, the best of horses and beds, food and wine, were eagerly\nplaced at the disposal of the favorite of the Tsar.  Rezanov's spirit,\nalways of the finest temper, suffered no eclipse for many days. He\nreveled in the belief that his sorely tried body was regenerating its\nold vigors.\n\nFrom Wercholensk to Katschuk the journey was so winding by river that\nit consumed more than twice the time of the land route, which although\nonly thirty versts in extent was one of the most difficult in Siberia.\nRezanov chose the latter without hesitation, and would listen to no\ndiscussion from the Commissary of the little town or from his\ndistracted Jon: the journey from Yakutsk had now lasted five weeks and\nthe servant's watchful eye noted signs of exhaustion.\n\nThe hills were very high and very steep, the roads but a name in\nsummer.  Had not the snow been soft and thin, the horses could not have\nmade the ascent at all; and, as it was, the riders were forced to walk\nthe greater part of the way and drag their unwilling steeds behind\nthem.  They were twelve hours covering the thirty versts, and at\nKatschuk Rezanov succumbed for two days, while Jon scoured the country\nin search of a telega; as sometimes happened there was a long stretch\nof country without snow, and sledges, by far the most comfortable\nmethod of travel in Siberia, could not be used.  The rest of the\njourney, but one hundred and ninety-six versts, must be made by land.\nRezanov admitted that he was too weary to ride, and refused to travel\nin the post carriage.  On the third day the servant managed to hire a\ntelega from a superior farmer and they started immediately, the heavy\nluggage having been consigned to a merchant vessel at Yakutsk.\n\nRezanov stood the telega exactly half a day. Little larger than an\narmchair and far lighter, it was drawn by horses that galloped up and\ndown hill and across the intervening valleys with no change of gait,\nand over a road so rough that the little vehicle seemed to be propelled\nby a succession of earthquakes.  Rezanov, in a fever which he\nattributed to rage, dismissed the telega at a village and awaited the\ncoming of Jon, who followed on horseback with the personal luggage.\n\nIt was a village of wooden houses built in the Russian fashion, and\ninhabited by a dignified tribe wearing long white garments bordered\nwith fur. They spoke Russian, a language little heard farther north and\neast in Siberia, and when Rezanov declined their hospitality they\ndispatched a courier at once to the Governor-General of Irkutsk\nacquainting him with the condition of the Chamberlain and of his\nimminent arrival.  In consequence, when Rezanov drew rein two days\nlater and looked down upon the city of Irkutsk with its pleasant\nsquares and great stone buildings beside the shining river, the gilded\ndomes and crosses of its thirty churches and convents glittering in the\nsun, the whole picture beckoning to the delirious brain of the traveler\nlike some mirage of the desert, his appearance was the signal for a\nsalute from the fort; and the Governor-General, privy counselor and\nsenator de Pestel, accompanied by the civil governor, the commandant,\nthe archbishop, and a military escort, sallied forth and led the guest,\nwith the formality of officials and the compassionate tenderness of\nmen, into the capital.\n\nFor three weeks longer Rezanov lay in the palace of the Governor.\nBetween fever and lassitude, his iron will seemed alternately to melt\nin the fiery furnace of his body, then, a cooling but still viscous and\nformless mass, sink to the utmost depths of his being.  But here he had\nthe best of nursing and attendance, rallied finally and insisted upon\ncontinuing his journey.  His doctor made the less demur as the\ntraveling was far smoother now, in the early days of March, than it\nwould be a month hence, when the snow was thinner and the sledges were\nno longer possible.  Nevertheless, he announced his intention to\naccompany him as far as Krasnoiarsk, where the Chamberlain could lodge\nin the house of the principal magistrate of the place, Counselor\nKeller, and, if necessary, be able to command fair nursing and medical\nattendance; and to this Rezanov indifferently assented.\n\nThe prospect of continuing his journey and the bustle of preparation\nraised the spirits of the invalid and gave him a fictitious energy.  He\nhad fought depression and despair in all his conscious moments, never\nadmitted that the devastation in his body was mortal.  With but a\nremnant of his former superb strength, and emaciated beyond\nrecognition, he attended a banquet on the night preceding his\ndeparture, and on the following morning stood up in his sledge and\nacknowledged the God-speed of the population of Irkutsk assembled in\nthe square before the palace of the Governor.  All his life he had\nexcited interest wherever he went, but never to such a degree as on\nthat last journey when he made his desperate fight for life and\nhappiness.\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\nThe snow rarely falls in Krasnoiarsk.  It is a little oasis in the\ngreat winter desert of Siberia.  Rezanov, his face turned to the\nwindow, could see the red banks on the opposite side of the river.  The\nsun transformed the gilded cupolas and crosses into dazzling points of\nlight, and the sky above the spires and towers, the stately square and\nnarrow dirty streets of the bustling little capital, was as blue and\nunflecked as that which arched so high above a land where Castilian\nroses grew, and one woman among a gay and thoughtless people dreamed,\nwith all the passion of her splendid youth, of the man to whom she had\npledged an eternal troth.  Rezanov's mind was clear in those last\nmoments, but something of the serenity and the selfishness of death had\nalready descended upon him.  He heard with indifference the sobs of\nJon, crouched at the foot of his bed. Tears and regrets were a part of\nthe general futility of life, insignificant enough at the grand\nthreshold of death.\n\nNo doubt that his great schemes would die with him, and were he\nremembered at all it would be as a dreamer; or as a failure because he\nhad died before accomplishing what his brain and energy and enthusiasm\nalone could force to fruition.  None realized better than he the\npaucity of initiative and executive among the characteristics of the\nSlav. What mattered it?  He had had glimpses more than once of the\napparently illogical sequence of life, the vanity of human effort, the\nwanton cruelty of Nature.  He had known men struck down before in the\nmaturity of their usefulness, cities destroyed by earthquake or\nhurricane in the fairest and most promising of their days: public men,\npriests, parents, children, wantons, criminals, blotted out with equal\nimpartiality by a brutal force that would seem to have but a casual use\nfor the life she flung broadcast on her planets.  Man was the helpless\nvictim of Nature, a calf in a tiger's paws.  If she overlooked him, or\nswept him contemptuously into the class of her favorites, well and\ngood; otherwise he was her sport, the plaything of her idler moments.\nThose that cried \"But why?\"  \"What reason?\"  \"What use?\" were those\nthat had never looked over the walls of their ego at the great dramatic\nmoments in the career of Nature, when she made immortal fame for\nherself at the expense of millions of pigmies.\n\nAnd if his energies, his talents, his usefulness, were held of no\naccount, at least he could look back upon a past when he would have\nseemed to be one of the few supreme favorites of the forces that shaped\nman's life and destiny.  Until he had started from Kronstadt four years\nbefore on a voyage that had humiliated his proud spirit more than once,\nand undermined as splendid a physique as ever was granted to even a\nRussian, he had rolled the world under his foot.  With an appearance\nand a personal magnetism, gifts of mind and manner and character that\nwould have commanded attention amid the general flaccidity of his race\nand conquered life without the great social advantages he inherited, he\nhad enjoyed power and pleasure to a degree that would have spoiled a\ncoarser nature long since. True, the time had come when he had cared\nlittle for any of his endowments save as a means to great ends, when\nall his energies had concentrated in the determination to live a life\nof the highest possible usefulness--without which man's span was but\nexistence--his ambitions had cohered and been driven steadily toward a\npermanent niche in history; then paled and dissolved for an hour in the\nglorious vision of human happiness.\n\nAnd wholly as he might realize man's insignificance among the blind\nforces of nature, he could accept it philosophically and die with his\nsoul uncorroded by misanthropy, that final and uncompromising admission\nof failure.  The misanthrope was the supreme failure of life because he\nhad not the intelligence to realize, or could not reconcile himself to,\nthe incomplete condition of human nature.  Man was made up of little\nqualities, and aspirations for great ones.  Many yielded in the\nstruggle and sank into impotent discontent among the small material\nthings of life, instead of uplifting themselves with the picture of the\ninevitable future when development had run its course, and indulgently\npitying the children of their own period who so often made life hateful\nwith their greed, selfishness, snobbery--most potent obstacle to human\nendeavor--and injustice.  The bad judgment of the mass!  How many\ncareers it had balked, if not ruined, with its poor ideals, its mean\nheroes, its instinctive avoidance of superior qualities foreign to\nitself, its contemptible desire to be identified with a fashion.  It\nwas this low standard of the crowd that induced misanthropy in many\notherwise brave spirits who lacked the insight to discern the divine\nspark underneath, the persistence, sure of reward, to fight their way\nto this spark and reveal it to the gaze of astonished and flattered\nhumanity.  Rezanov's very arrogance had led him to regard the mass of\nmankind as but one degree removed from the nursery; his good nature and\nphilosophical spirit to treat them with an indulgence that kept\nsourness out of his cynicism and inevitably recurring weariness and\ndisgust; his ardent imagination had consoled itself with the vision of\na future when man should live in a world made reasonable by the triumph\nof ideals that now lurked half ashamed in the high spaces of the human\nmind.\n\nHe looked back in wonder at the moment of wild regret and protest--the\nbitterer in its silence--when they had told him he must die; when in\nthe last rally of the vital forces he had believed his will was still\nstrong enough to command his ravaged body, to propel his brain, still\nteeming with a vast and complicated future, his heart, still warm and\ninsistent with the image it cherished, on to the ultimates of ambition\nand love.  How brief it had been, that last cry of mortality, with its\naccompaniment of furious wonder at his unseemly and senseless cutting\noff.  In the adjustment and readjustment of political and natural\nforces the world ambled on philosophically, fulfilling its inevitable\ndestiny.\n\nIf he had not been beyond humor, he would have smiled at the idea that\nin the face of all eternity it mattered what nation on one little\nplanet eventually possessed a fragment called California.  To him that\nfair land was empty and purposeless save for one figure, and even of\nher he thought with the terrible calm of dissolution.  During these\nlast months of illness and isolation he had been less lonely than at\nany time of his life save during those few weeks in California, for he\nhad lived with her incessantly in spirit; and in that subtle\nimaginative communion had pressed close to a profound and complex soul,\nrevealed before only in flashes to a vision astray in the confusion of\nthe senses.  He had felt that her response to his passion was far more\nvital and enduring than dwelt in the capacity of most women; he had\nappreciated her gifts of mind, her piquant variousness that scotched\nmonotony, the admirable characteristics that would give a man repose\nand content in his leisure, and subtly advance his career.  But in\nthose long reveries, at the head of his forlorn caravan or in the\ndesolate months of convalescence, he had arrived at an absolute\nunderstanding of what she herself had divined while half comprehending.\n\nTheirs was one of the few immortal loves that reveal the rarely sounded\ndeeps of the soul while in its frail tenement on earth; and he harbored\nnot a doubt that their love was stronger than mortality and that their\nultimate union was decreed.  Meanwhile, she would suffer, no one but he\ncould dream how completely, but her strong soul would conquer, and she\nwould live the life she had visioned in moments of despair; not of\ncloistered selfishness, but of incomparable usefulness to her little\nworld; and far happier, in her eternal youthfulness of heart, in that\ndivine life of the imagination where he must always be with her as she\nhad known him briefly at his best, than in the blunt commonplaceness of\ndaily existence, the routine and disillusionment of the world.\nPerhaps--who knew?--he had, after all, given her the best that man can\noffer to a woman of exalted nature; instead of taking again with his\nleft hand what his right had bestowed; completed the great gift of life\nwith the priceless beacon of death.\n\nHow unlike was life to the old Greek tragedies! He recalled his\nprophetic sense of impending happiness, success, triumph, as he entered\nCalifornia, the rejuvenescence of his spirit in the renewal of his\nwasted forces even before he loved the woman. Every event of the past\nyear, in spite of the obstacles that mortal must expect, had marched\nwith his ambitions and desires, and straight toward a future that would\nhave given him the most coveted of all destinies, a station in history.\nThere had not been a hint that his brain, so meaningly and consummately\nequipped, would perish in the ruins of his body in less than a\ntwelvemonth from that fragrant morning when he had entered the home of\nConcha Arguello tingling with a pagan joy in mere existence, a sudden\nrush of desire for the keen, wild happiness of youth--\n\nHis eyes wandered from the bright cross above the little cemetery where\nhe was to lie, and contracted with an expression of wonder.  Where had\nJon found Castilian roses in this barren land?  No man had ever been\nmore blest in a servant, but could even he--here--  With the last\ntriumph of will over matter he raised his head, his keen, searching\ngaze noting every detail of the room, bare and unlovely save for its\naltar and ikons, its kneeling priests and nuns.  His eyes expanded, his\nnostrils quivered.  As he sank down in the embrace of that final\ndelusion, his unconquerably sanguine spirit flared high before a vision\nof eternal and unthinkable happiness.\n\nSo died Rezanov; and with him the hope of Russians and the hindrance of\nAmericans in the west; and the mortal happiness and earthly dross of\nthe saintliest of California's women.\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:  I have made the following changes to the text:\n\n PAGE  LINE  ORIGINAL          CHANGED TO\n\n  ii    13  unforgetable      unforgettable\n  ii    26  vizu-             visu-\n  vi    29  Krasnioarsk       Krasnoiarsk\n  14    22  Arguella          Arguello\n  15    28  Anna              Ana\n  15    28  Gertrudes         Gertrudis\n  16     6  Ignacia           Ignacio\n  18    17  Dios de mi alma!  _Dios de mi alma!_*\n  20    11  Madre de Dios!\"   _Madre de Dios!_\"*\n  23     3  Ay yi!            _Ay yi!*\n  23     4  Dios,             Dios_,*\n  23    20  Propietario       Proprietario\n  23    23  plebian           plebeian\n  23    26  Madre de Dios!    _Madre de Dios!_*\n  25    18  Dios mio!         _Dios mio!\n  25    19  mio!\"             mio!_\"*\n  33    17  embarassing       embarrassing\n  33    24  Nadesha           Nadeshda\n  40    10  commercal         commercial\n  40    13  momentuous        momentous\n  43    28  disintergrating   disintegrating\n  51     5  He lover          Her lover\n  55     4  Morga             Moraga\n  71    22  Rafella           Rafaella\n  72     3  straights         straits\n  75     9  \"You              \"Your\n  94    16  inexhautible      inexhaustible\n 103     2  embarassed        embarrassed\n 105     3  preciptate        precipitate\n 106    28  Bueno             Buena\n 111     8  Madre de Dios,    _Madre de Dios_,*\n 117    30  prefer,           prefer.\n 118    20  I                 \"I\n 128    10  Arillaga          Arrillaga\n 128    18  ride of           rid of\n 133     8  Arillaga          Arrillaga\n 133    22  Arillaga          Arrillaga\n 135    10  Are               \"Are\n 137    28  Arrilaga          Arrillaga\n 137    29  Nakasaki          Nagasaki\n 146    21  refuse--'         refuse--\"\n 155    24  dumfounded        dumbfounded\n 169    29  Moragas           Moraga\n 171     7  twice--'          twice--\"\n 177    14  said said         he said\n 178    16  phasis.\"          phasis.\n 178    26  modoties          modities\n 195    17  civilized that    civilized than\n 200    27  gente de          _gente de_*\n 201     1  razon             _razon_*\n 201    21  silk              silks\n 204    29  Duena             duena\n 209     2  beneficient       beneficent\n 211    13  Ay yi!            _Ay yi!*\n 211    14  yi!               yi!_*\n 212    22  Ay yi!            _Ay yi!_*\n 213     3  ay yi!            _ay yi!_*\n\nI have also omitted the accents over proper names such as Rezanov,\nBaranhov, and Jose, and have omitted the umlaut over the u in Arguello.\n\n\n* indicates that the italics were NOT used as emphasis, but merely as\nindicators of SOME of the non-English words, and were eventually\nstripped of their italicism for easier reading.\n\nThe first words of each chapter were also capitalized on paper, as\nleast most of them.
