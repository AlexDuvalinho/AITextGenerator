 "text": "EMMA McCHESNEY & CO.\n\n\nby\n\nEdna Ferber\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\nCHAPTER\n\n   I.  BROADWAY TO BUENOS AIRES\n  II.  THANKS TO MISS MORRISSEY\n III.  A CLOSER CORPORATION\n  IV.  BLUE SERGE\n   V.  \"HOOPS, MY DEAR!\"\n  VI.  SISTERS UNDER THEIR SKIN\n VII.  AN ETUDE FOR EMMA\n\n\n\n\n\nEMMA McCHESNEY & CO.\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nBROADWAY TO BUENOS AIRES\n\nThe door marked \"MRS. MCCHESNEY\" was closed.  T. A. Buck, president of\nthe Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company, coming gaily down the hall,\nstopped before it, dismayed, as one who, with a spicy bit of news at\nhis tongue's end, is met with rebuff before the first syllable is\nvoiced.  That closed door meant:  \"Busy. Keep out.\"\n\n\"She'll be reading a letter,\" T. A. Buck told himself grimly. Then he\nturned the knob and entered his partner's office.\n\nMrs. Emma McChesney was reading a letter.  More than that, she was\nporing over it so that, at the interruption, she glanced up in a\nmaddeningly half-cocked manner which conveyed the impression that,\nwhile her physical eye beheld the intruder, her mental eye was still on\nthe letter.\n\n\"I knew it,\" said T. A. Buck morosely.\n\nEmma McChesney put down the letter and smiled.\n\n\"Sit down--now that you're in.  And if you expect me to say, 'Knew\nwhat?' you're doomed to disappointment.\"\n\nT. A. Buck remained standing, both gloved hands clasping his walking\nstick on which he leaned.\n\n\"Every time I come into this office, you're reading the latest scrawl\nfrom your son.  One would think Jock's letters were deathless\nmasterpieces.  I believe you read them at half-hour intervals all week,\nand on Sunday get 'em all out and play solitaire with them.\"\n\nEmma McChesney's smile widened frankly to a grin.\n\n\"You make me feel like a cash-girl who's been caught flirting with the\nelevator starter.  Have I been neglecting business?\"\n\n\"Business?  No; you've been neglecting me!\"\n\n\"Now, T. A., you've just come from the tailor's, and I suppose it\ndidn't fit in the back.\"\n\n\"It isn't that,\" interrupted Buck, \"and you know it. Look here!  That\nday Jock went away and we came back to the office, and you said----\"\n\n\"I know I said it, T. A., but don't remind me of it.  That wasn't a\nfair test.  I had just seen Jock leave me to take his own place in the\nworld.  You know that my day began and ended with him.  He was my\nreason for everything.  When I saw him off for Chicago that day, and\nknew he was going there to stay, it seemed a million miles from New\nYork.  I was blue and lonely and heart-sick.  If the office-boy had\nthrown a kind word to me I'd have broken down and wept on his shoulder.\"\n\nBuck, still standing, looked down between narrowed lids at his business\npartner.\n\n\"Emma McChesney,\" he said steadily, \"do you mean that?\"\n\nMrs. McChesney, the straightforward, looked up, looked down, fiddled\nwith the letter in her hand.\n\n\"Well--practically yes--that is--I thought, now that you're going to\nthe mountains for a month, it might give me a chance to think--to----\"\n\n\"And d'you know what I'll do meanwhile, out of revenge on the sex?\nI've just ordered three suits of white flannel, and I shall break every\nfeminine heart in the camp, regardless-- Oh, say, that's what I came in\nto tell you!  Guess whom I saw at the tailor's?\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Bones, whom did you, and so forth?\"\n\n\"Fat Ed Meyers.  I just glimpsed him in one of the fitting-rooms.  And\nthey were draping him in white.\"\n\nEmma McChesney sat up with a jerk.\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Sure?  There's only one figure like that.  He had the thing on and was\nsurveying himself in the mirror--or as much of himself as could be seen\nin one ordinary mirror.  In that white suit, with his red face above\nit, he looked like those pictures you see labeled, 'Sunrise on\nSnow-covered Mountain.'\"\n\n\"Did he see----\"\n\n\"He dodged when he saw me.  Actually!  At least, he seems to have the\ndecency to be ashamed of the deal he gave us when he left us flat in\nthe thick of his Middle Western trip and went back to the Sans-Silk\nSkirt Company.  I wanted him to know I had seen him.  As  I passed, I\nsaid, 'You'll mow 'em down in those clothes, Meyers.'\"  Buck sat down\nin his leisurely fashion, and laughed his low, pleasant laugh.  \"Can't\nyou see him, Emma, at the seashore?\"\n\nBut something in Emma McChesney's eyes, and something in her set,\nunsmiling face, told him that she was not seeing seashores.  She was\nstaring straight at him, straight through him, miles beyond him.  There\nwas about her that tense, electric, breathless air of complete\ndetachment, which always enveloped her when her lightning mind was\nleaping ahead to a goal unguessed by the slower thinking.\n\n\"What's your tailor's name?\"\n\n\"Name?  Trotter.  Why?\"\n\nEmma McChesney had the telephone operator before he could finish.\n\n\"Get me Trotter, the tailor, T-r-o-double-t-e-r.  Say I want to speak\nto the tailor who fits Mr. Ed Meyers, of the Sans-Silk Skirt Company.\"\n\nT. A. Buck leaned forward, mouth open, eyes wide.  \"Well, what in the\nname of----\"\n\n\"I'll let you know in a minute.  Maybe I'm wrong.  It's just one of my\nhunches.  But for  ten years I sold Featherlooms through the same\nterritory that Ed Meyers was covering for the Sans-Silk Skirt people.\nIt didn't take me ten years to learn that Fat Ed hadn't the decency to\nbe ashamed of any deal he turned, no matter how raw.  And let me tell\nyou, T. A.:  If he dodged when he saw you it wasn't because he was\nashamed of having played us low-down.  He was contemplating playing\nlower-down.  Of course, I may be----\"\n\nShe picked up the receiver in answer to the bell.  Then, sweetly, her\ncalm eyes smiling into Buck's puzzled ones:\n\n\"Hello!  Is this Mr. Meyers' tailor?  I'm to ask if you are sure that\nthe grade he selected is the proper weight for the tropics. What?  Oh,\nyou say you assured him it was the weight of flannel you always advise\nfor South America.  And you said they'd be ready when?  Next week?\nThank you.\"\n\nShe hung up the receiver.  The pupils of her eyes were dilated. Her\ncheeks were very pink as always under excitement.  She stood up, her\nbreath coming rather quickly.\n\n\"Hurray for the hunch!  It holds.  Fat Ed Meyers is going down to South\nAmerica for the Sans-Silk Company.  It's what I've been planning to do\nfor the last six months.  You remember I spoke of it.  You pooh-poohed\nthe idea.  It means hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Sans-Silk\npeople if they get it.  But they won't get it.\"\n\nT. A. Buck stood up suddenly.\n\n\"Look here, Emma!  If you're----\"\n\n\"I certainly am.  Nothing can stop me.  The skirt business has\nbeen--well, you know what it's been for the last two years.  The South\nAmerican boats sail twice a month.  Fat Ed Meyers' clothes are promised\nfor next week.  That means he isn't sailing until week after next.  But\nthe next boat sails in three days.\"  She picked up a piece of paper\nfrom her desk and tossed it into Buck's hand.  \"That's the letter I was\nreading when you came in. No; don't read it.  Let me tell you instead.\"\n\nBuck threw cane, hat, gloves, and letter on the broad desk, thrust his\nhands into his pockets, and prepared for argument. But he got only as\nfar as:  \"But I won't allow it!  You couldn't get away in three days,\nat any rate.  And at the end of two weeks you'll have come to your\nsenses, and besides----\"\n\n\"T. A., I don't mean to be rude.  But here are your hat and stick and\ngloves.  It's going to take me just forty-eight hours to mobilize.\"\n\n\"But, Emma, even if you do get in ahead of Meyers, it's an insane idea.\nA woman can't go down there alone.  It isn't safe. It's bad enough for\na man to tackle it.  Besides, we're holding our own.\"\n\n\"That's just it.  When a doctor issues a bulletin to the effect that\nthe patient is holding his own, you may have noticed that the relatives\nalways begin to gather.\"\n\n\"It's a bubble, this South American idea.  Oshkosh and Southport and\nAltoona money has always been good enough for us.  If we can keep that\ntrade, we ought to be thankful.\"\n\nEmma McChesney pushed her hair back from her forehead with one gesture\nand patted it into place with another.  Those two gestures, to one who\nknew her, meant loss of composure for one instant, followed by the\nquick regaining of it the next.\n\n\"Let's not argue about it now.  Suppose we wait until to-morrow--when\nit's too late.  I am thankful for the trade we've got.  But I don't\nwant to be narrow about it.  My thanking capacity is such that I can\nstretch it out to cover some things we haven't got yet.  I've been\nreading up on South America.\"\n\n\"Reading!\" put in Buck hotly.  \"What actual first-hand information can\nyou get about a country from books?\"\n\n\"Well, then, I haven't only been reading.  I've been talking to\neveryone I could lay my hands on who has been down there and who knows.\nThose South American women love dress--especially the Argentines.  And\ndo you know what they've been wearing? Petticoats made in England!  You\nknow what that means.  An English woman chooses a petticoat like she\ndoes a husband--for life.  It isn't only a garment.  It's a shelter.\nIt's built like a tent.  If once I can introduce the T. A. Buck\nFeatherloom petticoat and knickerbocker into sunny South America,\nthey'll use those English and German petticoats for linoleum\nfloor-coverings. Heaven knows they'll fit the floor better than the\nhuman form!\"\n\nBut Buck was unsmiling.  The muscles of his jaw were tense.\n\n\"I won't let you go.  Understand that!  I won't allow it!\"\n\n\"Tut, tut, T. A.!  What is this?  Cave-man stuff?\"\n\n\"Emma, I tell you it's dangerous.  It isn't worth the risk, no matter\nwhat it brings us.\"\n\nEmma McChesney struck an attitude, hand on heart.  \"'Heaven will\nprotect the working girrul,'\" she sang.\n\nBuck grabbed his hat.\n\n\"I'm going to wire Jock.\"\n\n\"All right!  That'll save me fifty cents.  Do you know what he'll wire\nback?  'Go to it.  Get the tango on its native tairn'--or words to that\neffect.\"\n\n\"Emma, use a little logic and common sense!\"\n\nThere was a note in Buck's voice that brought a quick response from\nMrs. McChesney.  She dropped her little air of gayety.  The pain in his\nvoice, and the hurt in his eyes, and the pleading in his whole attitude\nbanished the smile from her face.  It had not been much of a smile,\nanyway.  T. A. knew her genuine smiles well enough to recognize a\ncounterfeit at sight.  And Emma McChesney knew that he knew.  She came\nover and laid a hand lightly on his arm.\n\n\"T. A., I don't know anything about logic.    It is a hot-house plant.\nBut common sense is a field flower, and I've gathered whole bunches of\nit in my years of business experience.  I'm not going down to South\nAmerica for a lark.  I'm going because the time is ripe to go.  I'm\ngoing because the future of our business needs it.  I'm going because\nit's a job to be handled by the most experienced salesman on our staff.\nAnd I'm just that.  I say it because it's true.  Your father, T. A.,\nused to see things straighter and farther than any business man I ever\nknew.  Since his death made me a partner in this firm, I find myself,\nwhen I'm troubled or puzzled, trying to see a situation as he'd see it\nif he were alive.  It's like having an expert stand back of you in a\ngame of cards, showing you the next move.  That's the way I'm playing\nthis hand.  And I think we're going to take most of the tricks away\nfrom Fat Ed Meyers.\"\n\nT. A. Buck's eyes traveled from Emma McChesney's earnest, glowing face\nto the hand that rested on his arm.  He reached over and gently covered\nthat hand with his own.\n\n\"I suppose you must be right, little woman.  You always are. Dad was\nthe founder of this business.  It was the pride of his life.  That\nword 'founder' has two meanings.  I never want to be responsible for\nits second meaning in connection with this concern.\"\n\n\"You never will be, T. A.\"\n\n\"Not with you at the helm.\" He smiled rather sadly.  \"I'm a good,\nordinary, common seaman.  But you've got imagination, and foresight,\nand nerve, and daring, and that's the stuff that admirals are made of.\"\n\n\"Bless you, T. A.!  I knew you'd see the thing as I do after the first\nshock was over.  It has always been nip and tuck between the Sans-Silk\nCompany and us.  You gave me the hint that showed me their plans.  Now\nhelp me follow it up.\"\n\nBuck picked up his hat, squared his shoulders and fumbled with his\ngloves like a bashful schoolboy.\n\n\"You--you couldn't kill two birds with one stone on this trip, could\nyou, Mrs. Mack?\"\n\nMrs. McChesney, back at her desk again, threw him an inquiring glance\nover her shoulder.\n\n\"You might make it a combination honeymoon and Featherloom expedition.\"\n\n\"T. A. Buck!\" exclaimed Emma McChesney.  Then, as Buck dodged for the\ndoor:  \"Just for that, I'm going to break this to you. You know that I\nintended to handle the Middle Western territory for one trip, or until\nwe could get a man to take Fat Ed Meyers' place.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Buck apprehensively.\n\n\"I leave in three days.  Goodness knows how long I'll be gone! A\nbusiness deal down there is a ceremony.  And--you won't need any\nwhite-flannel clothes in Rock Island, Illinois.\"\n\nBuck, aghast, faced her from the doorway.\n\n\"You mean, I----\"\n\n\"Just that,\" smiled Emma McChesney pleasantly.  And pressed the button\nthat summoned the stenographer.\n\nIn the next forty-eight hours, Mrs. McChesney performed a series of\nmental and physical calisthenics that would have landed an ordinary\nwoman in a sanatorium.  She cleaned up with the thoroughness and\ndispatch of a housewife who, before going to the seashore, forgets not\ninstructions to the iceman, the milkman, the janitor, and the maid.\nShe surveyed her territory, behind and before, as a general studies\ntroops and countryside before going into battle; she foresaw factory\nemergencies, dictated office  policies, made sure of staff organization\nlike the business woman she was.  Out in the stock-room, under her\nsupervision, there was scientifically packed into sample-trunks and\ncases a line of Featherloom skirts and knickers calculated to dazzle\nBrazil and entrance Argentina.  And into her own personal trunk there\nwent a wardrobe, each article of which was a garment with a purpose.\nEmma McChesney knew the value of a smartly tailored suit in a business\nargument.\n\nT. A. Buck canceled his order at the tailor's, made up his own line for\nthe Middle West, and prepared to storm that prosperous and important\nterritory for the first time in his business career.\n\nThe South American boat sailed Saturday afternoon.  Saturday morning\nfound the two partners deep in one of those condensed, last-minute\ndiscussions.  Mrs. McChesney opened a desk drawer, took out a\nleather-covered pocket notebook, and handed it to Buck.  A tiny smile\nquivered about her lips.  Buck took it, mystified.\n\n\"Your last diary?\"\n\n\"Something much more important.  I call it  'The Salesman's Who's Who.'\nRead it as you ought your Bible.\"\n\n\"But what?\"  Buck turned the pages wonderingly.  He glanced at a\nparagraph, frowned, read it aloud, slowly.\n\n\n\"Des Moines, Iowa, Klein & Company.  Miss Ella Sweeney, skirt buyer.\nOld girl.  Skittish.  Wants to be entertained.  Take her to dinner and\nthe theater.\"\n\n\nHe looked up, dazed.  \"Good Lord, what is this?  A joke?\"\n\n\"Wait until you see Ella; you won't think it's a joke.  She'll buy only\nyour smoothest numbers, ask sixty days' dating, and expect you to\nentertain her as you would your rich aunt.\"\n\nBuck returned to the little book dazedly.  He flipped another\nleaf--another.  Then he read in a stunned sort of voice:\n\n\n\"Sam Bloom, Paris Emporium, Duluth.  See Sadie.\"\n\n\nHe closed the book.  \"Say, see here, Emma, do you mean to----\"\n\n\"Sam is the manager,\" interrupted Mrs. McChesney pleasantly, \"and he\nthinks he does the  buying, but the brains of that business is a little\ngirl named Sadie Harris.  She's a wonder. Five years from now, if she\ndoesn't marry Sam, she'll be one of those ten-thousand-a-year foreign\nbuyers.  Play your samples up to Sammy, but quote your prices down to\nSadie.  Read the next one, T. A.\"\n\nBuck read on, his tone lifeless:\n\n\n\"Miss Sharp.  Berg Brothers, Omaha.  Strictly business.  Known among\nthe trade as the human cactus.  Canceled a ten-thousand-dollar order\nonce because the grateful salesman called her 'girlie.'  Stick to\nskirts.\"\n\n\nBuck slapped the book smartly against the palm of his hand.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that you made this book out for me?  Do you\nmean to say that I have to cram on this like a kid studying for exams?\nThat I'll have to cater to the personality of the person I'm selling\nto?  Why--it's--it's----\"\n\nEmma McChesney nodded calmly.\n\n\"I don't know how this trip of yours is going to affect the firm's\nbusiness, T. A.  But it's going to be a liberal education for you.\nYou'll  find that you'll need that little book a good many times before\nyou're through.  And while you're following its advice, do this: forget\nthat your name is Buck, except for business purposes; forget that your\nfamily has always lived in a brownstone mausoleum in Seventy-second\nstreet; forget that you like your chops done just so, and your wine at\nsuch-and-such a temperature; get close to your trade.  They're an\nawfully human lot, those Middle Western buyers.  Don't chuck them under\nthe chin, but smile on 'em.  And you've got a lovely smile, T. A.\"\n\nBuck looked up from the little leather book.  And, as he gazed at Emma\nMcChesney, the smile appeared and justified its praise.\n\n\"I'll have this to comfort me, anyway, Emma.  I'll know that while I'm\nsmirking on the sprightly Miss Sweeney, your face will be undergoing\nvarious agonizing twists in the effort to make American prices\nunderstood by an Argentine who can't speak anything but Spanish.\"\n\n\"Maybe I am short on Spanish, but I'm long on Featherlooms.  I may not\nknow a senora from a chili con carne, but I know Featherlooms from the\nwaistband to the hem.\"  She leaned forward, dimpling like fourteen\ninstead of forty.  \"And you've noticed--haven't you, T. A.?--that I've\ngot an expressive countenance.\"\n\nBuck leaned forward, too.  His smile was almost gone.\n\n\"I've noticed a lot of things, Emma McChesney.  And if you persist in\ndeviling me for one more minute, I'm going to mention a few.\"\n\nEmma McChesney surveyed her cleared desk, locked the top drawer with a\nsnap, and stood up.\n\n\"If you do I'll miss my boat.  Just time to make Brooklyn. Suppose you\nwrite 'em.\"\n\nThat Ed Meyers might know nothing of her sudden plans, she had kept the\ntrip secret.  Besides Buck and the office staff, her son Jock was the\nonly one who knew.  But she found her cabin stocked like a prima\ndonna's on a farewell tour.  There were boxes of flowers, a package of\nbooks, baskets of fruit, piles of magazines, even a neat little sheaf\nof telegrams, one from the faithful bookkeeper, one from the workroom\nforeman, two from salesmen long in the firm's employ, two from Jock in\nChicago. She read them, her face glowing.  He and Buck had vied with\neach other in supplying her with luxuries that would make pleasanter\nthe twenty-three days of her voyage.\n\nShe looked about the snug cabin, her eyes suddenly misty.  Buck poked\nhis head in at the door.\n\n\"Come on up on deck, Emma; I've only a few minutes left.\"\n\nShe snatched a pink rose from the box, and together they went on deck.\n\n\"Just ten minutes,\" said Buck.  He was looking down at her. \"Remember,\nEmma, nothing that concerns the firm's business, however big, is half\nas important as the things that concern you personally, however small.\nI realize what this trip will mean to us, if it pans, and if you can\nbeat Meyers to it.  But if anything should happen to you, why----\"\n\n\"Nothing's going to happen, T. A., except that I'll probably come home\nwith my complexion ruined.  I'll feel a great deal more at home talking\npidgin-English to Senor Alvarez in Buenos Aires than you will talking\nFeatherlooms to Miss Skirt-Buyer in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  But remember\nthis, T. A.:  When you get to know--really to know--the Sadie Harrises\nand the Sammy Blochs and the  Ella Sweeneys of this world, you've\nlearned just about all there is to know about human beings.  Quick--the\ngangplank! Goodby, T. A.\"\n\nThe dock reached, he gazed up at her as she leaned far over the\nrailing.  He made a megaphone of his hands.\n\n\"I feel like an old maid who's staying home with her knitting,\" he\ncalled.\n\nThe boat began to move.  Emma McChesney passed a quick hand over her\neyes.\n\n\"Don't drop any stitches, T. A.\"  With unerring aim she flung the big\npink rose straight at him.\n\nShe went about arranging her affairs on the boat like the business\nwoman that she was.  First she made her cabin shipshape. She placed\nnearest at hand the books on South America, and the Spanish-American\npocket interpreter.  She located her deck chair, and her seat in the\ndining-room.  Then, quietly, unobtrusively, and guided by those years\nspent in meeting men and women face to face in business, she took\nthorough, conscientious mental stock of those others who were to be her\nfellow travelers for twenty-three days.\n\nFor the most part, the first-class passengers were men.  There were\nAmerican business men--salesmen, some of them, promoters others, or\nrepresentatives of big syndicates shrewd, alert, well dressed, smooth\nshaven.  Emma McChesney knew that she would gain valuable information\nfrom many of them before the trip was over. She sighed a little\nregretfully as she thought of those smoking-room talks--those intimate,\ntobacco-mellowed business talks from which she would be barred by her\nsex.\n\nThere were two engineers, one British, one American, both very\nintelligent-looking, both inclined to taciturnity, as is often the case\nin men of their profession.  They walked a good deal, and smoked\nnut-brown, evil-smelling pipes, and stared unblinkingly across the\nwater.\n\nThere were Argentines--whole families of them--Brazilians, too. The\nfat, bejeweled Brazilian men eyed Emma McChesney with open approval,\neven talked to her, leering objectionably.  Emma McChesney refused to\nbe annoyed.  Her ten years on the road served her in good stead now.\n\nBut most absorbing of all to Emma McChesney, watching quietly over her\nbook or magazine, was a tall, erect, white-bearded Argentine who, with\nhis family, occupied chairs near hers.  His name had struck her with\nthe sound of familiarity when she read it on the passenger list.  She\nhad asked the deck-steward to point out the name's owner.  \"Pages,\" she\nrepeated to herself, worriedly, \"Pages?  P----\"  Suddenly she knew.\nPages y Hernandez, the owner of the great Buenos Aires shop--a shop\nfiner than those of Paris.  And this was Pages!  All the Featherloom\ninstinct in Emma McChesney came to the surface and stayed there,\nseething.\n\nThat was the morning of the second day out.  By afternoon, she had\nbribed and maneuvered so that her deck chair was next that of the\nPages-family flock of chairs.  Senor Pages reminded her of one of those\ndashing, white-haired, distinguished-looking men whose likeness graces\nthe cover of a box of your favorite cigars.\n\nGeneral Something-or-other-ending-in-z he should have been, with a\nrevolutionary background.  He dressed somberly in black, like most of\nthe other Argentine men on board.  There was Senora Pages, very fat,\nvery indolent, very blank, much given to pink satin and diamonds at\ndinner.  Senorita Pages, over-powdered, overfrizzed, marvelously\ngowned, with overplumpness just a few years away, sat quietly by Senora\nPages' side, but her darting, flashing, restless eyes were never still.\nThe son (Emma heard them call him Pepe) was barely eighteen, she\nthought, but quite a man of the world, with his cigarettes, his drinks,\nhis bold eyes. She looked at his sallow, pimpled skin, his lean, brown\nhands, his lack-luster eyes, and she thought of Jock and was happy.\n\nMrs. McChesney knew that she might visit the magnificent Buenos Aires\nshop of Pages y Hernandez day after day for months without ever\nobtaining a glimpse of either Pages or Hernandez.  And here was Senor\nPages, so near that she could reach out and touch him from her deck\nchair.  Here was opportunity!  A caller who had never been obliged to\nknock twice at Emma McChesney's door.\n\nHer methods were so simple that she herself smiled at them.  She donned\nher choicest suit of white serge that she had been saving for shore\nwear.  Its skirt had been cut by the very newest trick. Its coat was\nthe kind to make you go home and get out your own white serge and gaze\nat it with loathing.  Senorita Pages' eyes leaped to that suit as iron\nleaps to the magnet.  Emma McChesney, passing her deck chair, detached\nthe eyes with a neat smile.  Why hadn't she spent six months neglecting\nSkirts for Spanish? she asked herself, groaning.  As she approached her\nown deck chair again she risked a bright, \"Good morning.\"  Her heart\nbounded, stood still, bounded again, as from the lips of the assembled\nPages there issued a combined, courteous, perfectly good American,\n\"Good morning!\"\n\n\"You speak English!\" Emma McChesney's tone expressed flattery and\nsurprise.\n\nPages pere made answer.\n\n\"Ah, yes, it is necessary.  There are many English in Argentina.\"\n\nA sigh--a fluttering, tremulous sigh of perfect peace and\nhappiness--welled up from Emma McChesney's heart and escaped through\nher smiling lips.\n\nBy noon, Senorita Pages had tried on the fascinating coat and secured\nthe address of its builder.  By afternoon, Emma McChesney was showing\nthe newest embroidery stitch to the slow but docile Senora Pages.  Next\nmorning she was playing shuffleboard with the elegant, indolent Pepe,\nand talking North American football and baseball to him.  She had not\nbeen Jock McChesney's mother all those years for nothing.  She could\ndiscuss sports with the best of them.  Young Pages was avidly\ninterested.  Outdoor sports had become the recent fashion among the\nrich young Argentines.\n\nThe problem of papa Pages was not so easy.  Emma McChesney approached\nher subject warily, skirting the bypaths of politics, war, climate,\ncustoms--to business.  Business!\n\n\"But a lady as charming as you can understand nothing of business,\"\nsaid Senor Pages.  \"Business is for your militant sisters.\"\n\n\"But we American women do understand business.  Many--many charming\nAmerican women are in business.\"\n\nSenor Pages turned his fine eyes upon her.  She had talked most\ninterestingly, this pretty American woman.\n\n\"Perhaps--but pardon me if I think not.  A woman cannot be really\ncharming and also capable in business.\"\n\nEmma McChesney dimpled becomingly.\n\n\"But I know a woman who is as--well, as charming as you say I am.\nStill, she is known  as a capable, successful business woman.  She'll\nbe in Buenos Aires when I am.\"\n\nSenor Pages shook an unbelieving head.  Emma McChesney leaned forward.\n\n\"Will you let me bring her in to meet you, just to prove my point?\"\n\n\"She must be as charming as you are.\"  His Argentine betting\nproclivities rose.  \"Here; we shall make a wager!\"  He took a card from\nhis pocket, scribbled on it, handed it to Emma McChesney.  \"You will\nplease present that to my secretary, who will conduct you immediately\nto my office.  We will pretend it is a friendly call.  Your friend need\nnot know.  If I lose----\"\n\n\"If you lose, you must promise to let her show you her sample line.\"\n\n\"But, dear madam, I do no buying.\"\n\n\"Then you must introduce her favorably to the department buyer of her\nsort of goods.\"\n\n\"But if I win?\" persisted Senor Pages.\n\n\"If she isn't as charming as--as you say I am, you may make your own\nterms.\"\n\nSenor Pages' fine eyes opened wide.\n\nIt was on the fourteenth day of their trip that they came into quaint\nBahia.  The stay there was short.  Brazilian business methods  are\nlong.  Emma McChesney took no chances with sample-trunks or cases.  She\npacked her three leading samples into her own personal suitcase, eluded\nthe other tourists, secured an interpreter, and prepared to brave\nBahia.  She returned just in time to catch the boat, flushed, tired,\nand orderless.  Bahia would have none of her.\n\nIn three days they would reach Rio de Janeiro, the magnificent. They\nwould have three days there.  She told herself that Bahia didn't count,\nanyway--sleepy little half-breed town!  But the arrow rankled.  It had\nbeen the first to penetrate the armor of her business success.  But she\nhad learned things from that experience at Bahia.  She had learned that\nthe South American dislikes the North American because his Northern\ncousin patronizes him.  She learned that the North American business\nfirm is thought by the Southern business man to be tricky and\ndishonest, and that, because the Northerner has not learned how to pack\na case of goods scientifically, as have the English, Germans, and\nFrench, the South American rages to pay cubic-feet rates on boxes that\nare three-quarters empty.\n\nSo it was with a heavy heart but a knowing head that she faced Rio de\nJaneiro.  They had entered in the evening, the sunset splashing the bay\nand the hills in the foreground and the Sugar-loaf Mountain with an\nunbelievable riot of crimson and gold and orange and blue.  Suddenly\nthe sun jerked down, as though pulled by a string, and the magic purple\nnight came up as though pulled by another.\n\n\"Well, anyway, I've seen that,\" breathed Emma McChesney thankfully.\n\nNext morning, she packed her three samples, as before, her heart heavy,\nher mind on Fat Ed Meyers coming up two weeks behind her. Three days in\nRio!  And already she had bumped her impatient, quick-thinking,\nquick-acting North American business head up against the stone wall of\nSouth American leisureliness and prejudice.  She meant no irreverence,\nno impiety as she prayed, meanwhile packing Nos. 79, 65, and 48 into\nher personal bag:\n\n\"O Lord, let Fat Ed Meyers have Bahia; but please, please help me to\nland Rio and Buenos Aires!\"\n\nThen, in smart tailored suit and hat, interpreter in tow, a prayer in\nher heart, and excitement blazing in cheeks and eyes, she made her way\nto the dock, through the customs, into a cab that was to take her to\nher arena, the broad Avenida.\n\nExactly two hours later, there dashed into the customs-house a\nwell-dressed woman whose hat was very much over one ear.  She was\nrunning as only a woman runs when she's made up her mind to get there.\nShe came hot-foot, helter-skelter, regardless of modishly crippling\nskirt, past officers, past customs officials, into the section where\nstood the one small sample-trunk that she had ordered down in case of\nemergency.  The trunk had not gone through the customs.  It had not\neven been opened.  But Emma McChesney heeded not trifles like that.\nRio de Janeiro had fallen for Featherlooms.  Those three samples, Nos.\n79, 65, and 48, that boasted style, cut, and workmanship never before\nseen in Rio, had turned the trick.  They were as a taste of blood to a\nhungry lion.  Rio wanted more!\n\nEmma McChesney was kneeling before her trunk, had whipped out her key,\nunlocked it, and was swiftly selecting the numbers wanted from the\ntrays, her breath coming quickly, her deft fingers choosing unerringly,\nwhen an indignant voice said, in Portuguese, \"It is forbidden!\"\n\nEmma McChesney did not glance around.  Her head was buried in the\ndepths of the trunk.  But her quick ears had caught the word, \"PROHIBA!\"\n\n\"Speak English,\" she said, and went on unpacking.\n\n\"INGLES!\" shouted the official.  \"No!\"  Then, with a superhuman effort,\nas Emma McChesney stood up, her arms laden with Featherloom samples of\nrainbow hues, \"PARE!  Ar-r-r-rest!\"\n\nMrs. McChesney slammed down the trunk top, locked it, clutched her\nsamples firmly, and faced the enraged official.\n\n\"Go 'way!  I haven't time to be arrested this morning.  This is my busy\nday.  Call around this evening.\"\n\nWhereupon she fled to her waiting cab, leaving behind her a Brazilian\nofficial stunned and raging by turns.\n\nWhen she returned, happy, triumphant, order-laden, he was standing\nthere, stunned no longer but raging still.  Emma McChesney had\nforgotten all about him.  The gold-braided official advanced,\nmustachios bristling.  A volley of Portuguese burst from his long-pent\nlips.  Emma McChesney glanced behind her.  Her interpreter threw up\nhelpless hands, replying with a still more terrifying burst of vowels.\nBewildered, a little frightened, Mrs. McChesney stood helplessly by.\nThe official laid a none too gentle hand on her shoulder.  A little\ngroup of lesser officials stood, comic-opera fashion, in the\nbackground. And then Emma McChesney's New York training came to her\naid.  She ignored the voluble interpreter.  She remained coolly\nunruffled by the fusillade of Portuguese.  Quietly she opened her hand\nbag and plunged her fingers deep, deep therein.  Her blue eyes gazed\nconfidingly up into the Brazilian's snapping black ones, and as she\nwithdrew her hand from the depths of her purse, there passed from her\nwhite fingers to his brown ones that which is the Esperanto of the\nnations, the universal language understood from Broadway to Brazil.\nThe hand on her shoulder relaxed and fell away.\n\nOn deck once more, she encountered the suave Senor Pages.  He stood at\nthe rail surveying Rio's shores with that lip-curling contempt of the\nArgentine for everything Brazilian.  He regarded Emma McChesney's\nradiant face.\n\n\"You are pleased with this--this Indian Rio?\"\n\nMrs. McChesney paused to gaze with him at the receding shores.\n\n\"Like it!  I'm afraid I haven't seen it.  From here it looks like\nConey.  But it buys like Seattle.  Like it!  Well, I should say I do!\"\n\n\"Ah, senora,\" exclaimed Pages, distressed, \"wait!  In six days you will\nbehold Buenos Aires.  Your New York, Londres, Paris--bah!  You shall\ndrive with my wife and daughter through Palermo.  You shall see jewels,\nmotors, toilettes as never before.  And you will visit my\nestablishment?\"  He raised an emphatic forefinger.  \"But surely!\"\n\nEmma McChesney regarded him solemnly.\n\n\"I promise to do that.  You may rely on me.\"\n\nSix days later they swept up the muddy and majestic Plata, whose color\nshould have won it the name of River of Gold instead of River of\nSilver.  From the boat's upper deck, Emma McChesney beheld a sky line\nwhich was so like the sky line of her own New York that it gave her a\nshock.  She was due for still another shock when, an hour later, she\nfound herself in a maelstrom of motors, cabs, street cars, newsboys,\nskyscrapers, pedestrians, policemen, subway stations.  Where was the\nSouth American languor?  Where the Argentine inertia?  The rush and\nroar of it, the bustle and the bang of it made the twenty-three-day\nvoyage seem a myth.\n\n\"I'm going to shut my eyes,\" she told herself, \"and then open them\nquickly.  If that little brown traffic-policeman turns out to be a big,\nred-faced traffic-policeman, then I'm right, and this IS Broadway and\nForty-second.\"\n\nShock number three came upon her entrance at the Grande Hotel. It had\nbeen Emma McChesney's boast that her ten years on the road had\nfamiliarized her with every type, grade, style, shape, cut, and mold of\nhotel clerk.  She knew him from the Knickerbocker to the Eagle House at\nWaterloo, Iowa.  At the moment she entered the Grande Hotel, she knew\nshe had overlooked one.  Accustomed though she was  to the sartorial\nsplendors of the man behind the desk, she might easily have mistaken\nthis one for the president of the republic.  In his glittering uniform,\nhe looked a pass between the supreme chancellor of the K.P.'s in full\nregalia and a prince of India during the Durbar.  He was regal.  He was\noverwhelming. He would have made the most splendid specimen of North\nAmerican hotel clerk look like a scullery boy.  Mrs. McChesney spent\ntwo whole days in Buenos Aires before she discovered that she could\nparalyze this personage with a peso.  A peso is forty-three cents.\n\nHer experience at Bahia and at Rio de Janeiro had taught her things.\nSo for two days, haunted, as she was, by visions of Fat Ed Meyers\ncoming up close behind her, she possessed her soul in patience and\nwaited.  On the great firm of Pages y Hernandez rested the success of\nthis expedition.  When she thought of her little trick on Senor Pages,\nher blithe spirits sank.  Suppose, after all, that this powerful South\nAmerican should resent her little Yankee joke!\n\nHer trunks went through the customs.  She secured an interpreter. She\narranged her samples with loving care.  Style, cut, workmanship--she\nran over their strong points in her mind.  She looked at them as a\nmother's eyes rest fondly on the shining faces, the well-brushed hair,\nthe clean pinafores of her brood. And her heart swelled with pride.\nThey lay on their tables, the artful knickerbockers, the gleaming\npetticoats, the pink and blue pajamas, the bifurcated skirts.  Emma\nMcChesney ran one hand lightly over the navy blue satin folds of a\nsample.\n\n\"Pages or no Pages, you're a credit to your mother,\" she said,\nwhimsically.\n\nUp in her room once more, she selected her smartest tailor costume, her\nmost modish hat, the freshest of gloves and blouses.\n\nShe chose the hours between four and six, when wheel traffic was\nsuspended in the Calle Florida and throughout the shopping-district,\nthe narrow streets of which are congested to the point of suffocation\nat other times.\n\nAs she swung down the street they turned to gaze after her--these\nArgentines.  The fat senoras turned, and the smartly costumed, sallow\nsenoritas, and the men--all of them.  They spoke to her, these last,\nbut she had expected that, and marched on with her free, swinging\nstride, her chin high, her color very bright. Into the great shop of\nPages y Hernandez at last, up to the private offices, her breath coming\na little quickly, into the presence of the shiny secretary--shiny\nteeth, shiny hair, shiny skin, shiny nails.  He gazed upon Emma\nMcChesney, the shine gleaming brighter.  He took in his slim, brown\nfingers the card on which Senor Pages had scribbled that day on board\nship.  The shine became dazzling.  He bowed low and backed his way into\nthe office of Senor Pages.\n\nA successful man is most impressive when in those surroundings which\nhave been built up by his success.  On shipboard, Senor Pages had been\na genial, charming, distinguished fellow passenger.  In his luxurious\nbusiness office he still was genial, charming, but his environment\nseemed to lend him a certain austerity.\n\n\"Senora McChesney!\"\n\n(\"How awful that sounds!\" Emma McChesney told herself.)\n\n\"We spoke of you but last night.  And now you come to win the wager,\nyes?\" He smiled, but shook his head.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Emma McChesney.  And tried to smile, too.\n\nSenor Pages waved a hand toward the outer office.\n\n\"She is with you, this business friend who is also so charming?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Emma McChesney, \"she's--she's with me.\" Then, as he\nmade a motion toward the push-button, which would summon the secretary:\n\"No, don't do that!  Wait a minute!\" From her bag she drew her business\ncard, presented it.  \"Read that first.\"\n\nSenor Pages read it.  He looked up.  Then he read it again.  He gazed\nagain at Emma McChesney.  Emma McChesney looked straight at him and\ntried in vain to remember ever having heard of the South American's\nsense of humor.  A moment passed.  Her heart sank. Then Senor Pages\nthrew back his fine head and laughed--laughed as the Latin laughs,\nemphasizing his mirth with many ejaculations and gestures.\n\n\"Ah, you Northerners!  You are too quick for us.  Come; I myself must\nsee this garment which you honor by selling.\"  His glance rested\napprovingly on Emma McChesney's trim, smart figure. \"That which you\nsell, it must be quite right.\"\n\n\"I not only sell it,\" said Emma McChesney; \"I wear it.\"\n\n\"That--how is it you Northerners say?--ah, yes--that settles it!\"\n\nSix weeks later, in his hotel room in Columbus, Ohio, T. A. Buck sat\nreading a letter forwarded from New York and postmarked Argentina.  As\nhe read he chuckled, grew serious, chuckled again and allowed his cigar\nto grow cold.\n\nFor the seventh time:\n\nDEAR T. A.:\n\nThey've fallen for Featherlooms the way an Eskimo takes to gum-drops.\nMy letter of credit is all shot to pieces, but it was worth it.  They\nmake you pay a separate license fee in each province, and South America\nis just one darn province after another.  If they'd lump a peddler's\nlicense for $5,000 and tell you to go ahead, it would be cheaper.\n\nI landed Pages y Hernandez by a trick.  The best of it is the man I\nplayed it on saw the point and laughed with me.  We North Americans\nbrag too much about our sense of humor.\n\nI thought ten years on the road had hardened me to the most fiendish\nefforts of a hotel chef.  But the food at the Grande here makes a\nquarter-inch round steak with German fried look like Sherry's latest\ntriumph.  You know I'm not fussy.  I'm the kind of woman who, given her\nchoice of ice cream or cheese for dessert, will take cheese.  Here,\ngiven my choice, I play safe and take neither.  I've reached the point\nwhere I make a meal of radishes.  They kill their beef in the morning\nand serve it for lunch.  It looks and tastes like an Ethiop's ear.  But\nI don't care, because I'm getting gorgeously thin.\n\nIf the radishes hold out I'll invade Central America and Panama. I've\none eye on Valparaiso already.  I know it sounds wild, but it means a\nfuture and a fortune for Featherlooms.  I find I don't even have to\ntalk skirts.  They're self-sellers.  But I have to talk honesty and\npacking.\n\nHow did you hit it off with Ella Sweeney?  Haven't seen a sign of Fat\nEd Meyers.  I'm getting nervous.  Do you think he may have exploded at\nthe equator?\n\n   EMMA.\n\n\nBut kind fortune saw fit to add a last sweet drop to Emma McChesney's\nalready brimming cup.  As she reached the docks on the day of her\ndeparture, clad in cool, crisp white from hat to shoes, her quick eye\nspied a red-faced, rotund, familiar figure disembarking from the New\nYork boat, just arrived.  The fates, grinning, had planned this moment\nlike a stage-manager.  Fat Ed Meyers came heavily down the gangplank.\nHis hat was off.  He was mopping the top of his head with a large, damp\nhandkerchief.  His gaze swept over the busy landing-docks, darted\nhither and thither, alighted on Emma McChesney with a shock, and rested\nthere.  A distinct little shock went through that lady, too.  But she\nwaited at the foot of her boat's gangway until the unbelievably nimble\nMeyers reached her.\n\nHe was a fiery spectacle.  His cheeks were distended, his eyes\nprotuberant.  He wasted no words.  They understood each other, those\ntwo.\n\n\"Coming or going?\"\n\n\"Going,\" replied Emma McChesney.\n\n\"Clean up this--this Bonez Areez, too?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\n\"Did, huh?\"\n\nMeyers stood a moment panting, his little eyes glaring into her calm\nones.\n\n\"Well, I beat you in Bahia, anyway.\" he boasted.\n\nEmma McChesney snapped her fingers blithely.\n\n\"Bah, for Bahia!\"  She took a step or two up the gangplank, and turned.\n\"Good-by, Ed.  And good luck.  I can recommend the radishes, but pass\nup the beef.  Dangerous.\"\n\nFat Ed Meyers, still staring, began to stutter unintelligibly, his lips\nmoving while no words came.  Emma McChesney held up a warning hand.\n\n\"Don't do that, Ed!  Not in this climate!  A man of your build, too!\nI'm surprised.  Consider the feelings of your firm!\"\n\nFat Ed Meyers glared up at the white-clad, smiling, gracious figure.\nHis hands unclenched.  The words came.\n\n\"Oh, if only you were a man for just ten minutes!\" he moaned.\n\n\n\nII\n\nTHANKS TO MISS MORRISSEY\n\nIt was Fat Ed Meyers, of the Sans-Silk Skirt Company, who first said\nthat Mrs. Emma McChesney was the Maude Adams of the business world.  It\nwas on the occasion of his being called to the carpet for his failure\nto make Sans-silks as popular as Emma McChesney's famed Featherlooms.\nHe spoke in self-defense, heatedly.\n\n\"It isn't Featherlooms.  It's McChesney.  Her line is no better than\nours.  It's her personality, not her petticoats.  She's got a following\nthat swears by her.  If Maude Adams was to open on Broadway in 'East\nLynne,' they'd flock to see her, wouldn't they? Well, Emma McChesney\ncould sell hoop-skirts, I'm telling you. She could sell bustles.  She\ncould sell red-woolen mittens on Fifth Avenue!\"\n\nThe title stuck.\n\nIt was late in September when Mrs. McChesney, sunburned, decidedly\nunder weight, but  gloriously triumphant, returned from a four months'\ntour of South America.  Against the earnest protests of her business\npartner, T. A. Buck, president of the Buck Featherloom Petticoat\nCompany, she had invaded the southern continent and left it abloom with\nFeatherlooms from the Plata to the Canal.\n\nSuccess was no stranger to Mrs. McChesney.  This last business victory\nhad not turned her head.  But it had come perilously near to tilting\nthat extraordinarily well-balanced part.  A certain light in her eyes,\na certain set of her chin, an added briskness of bearing, a cocky slant\nof the eyebrow revealed the fact that, though Mrs. McChesney's feet\nwere still on the ground, she might be said to be standing on tiptoe.\n\nWhen she had sailed from Brooklyn pier that June afternoon, four months\nbefore, she had cast her ordinary load of business responsibilities on\nthe unaccustomed shoulders of T. A. Buck. That elegant person, although\npresident of the company which his father had founded, had never been\nits real head.  When trouble threatened in the workroom, it was to Mrs.\nMcChesney that the forewoman came.   When an irascible customer in\nGreen Bay, Wisconsin, waxed impatient over the delayed shipment of a\nFeatherloom order, it was to Emma McChesney that his typewritten\nprotest was addressed.  When the office machinery needed mental oiling,\nwhen a new hand demanded to be put on silk-work instead of mercerized,\nwhen a consignment of skirt-material turned out to be more than usually\nmetallic, it was in Mrs. Emma McChesney's little private office that\nthe tangle was unsnarled.\n\nShe walked into that little office, now, at nine o'clock of a brilliant\nSeptember morning.  It was a reassuring room, bright, orderly,\nworkmanlike, reflecting the personality of its owner. She stood in the\ncenter of it now and looked about her, eyes glowing, lips parted.  She\nraised her hands high above her head, then brought them down to her\nsides again with an unconsciously dramatic gesture that expressed\ntriumph, peace, content, relief, accomplishment, and a great and deep\nsatisfaction.  T. A. Buck, in the doorway, saw the gesture--and\nunderstood.\n\n\"Not so bad to get back to it, is it?\"\n\n\"Bad!  It's like a drink of cool spring water after too much champagne.\nIn those miserable South American hotels, how I used to long for the\norderliness and quiet of this!\"\n\nShe took off hat and coat.  In a vase on the desk, a cluster of yellow\nchrysanthemums shook their shaggy heads in welcome.  Emma McChesney's\nquick eye jumped to them, then to Buck, who had come in and was\nsurveying the scene appreciatively.\n\n\"You--of course.\" She indicated the flowers with a nod and a radiant\nsmile.\n\n\"Sorry--no.  The office staff did that.  There's a card of welcome, I\nbelieve.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Emma McChesney.  The smile was still there, but the radiance\nwas gone.\n\nShe seated herself at her desk.  Buck took the chair near by. She\nunlocked a drawer, opened it, rummaged, closed it again, unlocked\nanother.  She patted the flat top of her desk with loving fingers.\n\n\"I can't help it,\" she said, with a little shamed laugh; \"I'm so glad\nto be back.  I'll probably hug the forewoman and bite a piece out of\nthe first Featherloom I lay hands on.  I had to use all my self-control\nto keep from kissing Jake, the elevator-man, coming up.\"\n\nOut of the corner of her eye, Emma McChesney had been glancing at her\nhandsome business partner.  She had found herself doing the same thing\nfrom the time he had met her at the dock late in the afternoon of the\nday before.  Those four months had wrought some subtle change.  But\nwhat?  Where?  She frowned a moment in thought.\n\nThen:\n\n\"Is that a new suit, T. A.?\"\n\n\"This?  Lord, no!  Last summer's.  Put it on because of this July\nhangover in September.  Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know\"--vaguely--\"I just--wondered.\"\n\nThere was nothing vague about T. A. Buck, however.  His old air of\nleisureliness was gone.  His very attitude as he sat there, erect,\nbrisk, confident, was in direct contrast to his old, graceful indolence.\n\n\"I'd like to go over the home grounds with you this morning,\" he said.\n\"Of course, in our talk last night, we didn't cover the South American\nsituation thoroughly.  But your letters and the orders told the story.\nYou carried the thing through to success.  It's marvelous!  But we\nstay-at-homes haven't been marking time during your absence.\"\n\nThe puzzled frown still sat on Emma McChesney's brow.  As though\nthinking aloud, she said,\n\n\"Have you grown thinner, or fatter or--something?\"\n\n\"Not an ounce.  Weighed at the club yesterday.\"\n\nHe leaned forward a little, his face suddenly very sober.\n\n\"Emma, I want to tell you now that--that mother--she--I lost her just a\nfew weeks after you sailed.\"\n\nEmma McChesney gave a little cry.  She came quickly over to him, and\none hand went to his shoulder as she stood looking down at him, her\nface all sympathy and contrition and sorrow.\n\n\"And you didn't write me!  You didn't even tell me, last night!\"\n\n\"I didn't want to distress you.  I knew you were having a hard-enough\npull down there without additional worries.  It happened very suddenly\nwhile I was out on the road.  I got the wire in Peoria.  She died very\nsuddenly  and quite painlessly. Her companion, Miss Tate, was with her.\nShe had never been herself since Dad's death.\"\n\n\"And you----\"\n\n\"I could only do what was to be done.  Then I went back on the road.  I\nclosed up the house, and now I've leased it.  Of course it's big enough\nfor a regiment.  But we stayed on because mother was used to it.  I\nsold some of the furniture, but stored the things she had loved.  She\nleft some to you.\"\n\n\"To me!\"\n\n\"You know she used to enjoy your visits so much, partly because of the\nway in which you always talked of Dad.  She left you some jewelry that\nshe was fond of, and that colossal old mahogany buffet that you used to\nrave over whenever you came up.  Heaven knows what you'll do with it!\nIt's a white elephant.  If you add another story to it, you could rent\nit out as an apartment.\"\n\n\"Indeed I shall take it, and cherish it, and polish it up myself every\nweek--the beauty!\"\n\nShe came back to her chair.  They sat a moment in silence.  Then Emma\nMcChesney spoke musingly.\n\n\"So that was it.\" Buck looked up.  \"I sensed something--different.  I\ndidn't know.  I couldn't explain it.\"\n\nBuck passed a quick hand over his eyes, shook himself, sat up, erect\nand brisk again, and plunged, with a directness that was as startling\nas it was new in him, into the details of Middle Western business.\n\n\"Good!\" exclaimed Emma McChesney.\n\n\"It's all very well to know that Featherlooms are safe in South\nAmerica.  But the important thing is to know how they're going in the\ncorn country.\"\n\nBuck stood up.\n\n\"Suppose we transfer this talk to my office.  All the papers are there,\nall the correspondence--all the orders, everything.  You can get the\nwhole situation in half an hour.  What's the use of talking when\nfigures will tell you.\"\n\nHe walked swiftly over to the door and stood there waiting.  Emma\nMcChesney rose.  The puzzled look was there again.\n\n\"No, that wasn't it, after all,\" she said.\n\n\"Eh?\" said Buck.  \"Wasn't what?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Emma McChesney.\n\n\"I'm wool-gathering this morning.  I'm afraid  it's going to take me a\nday or two to get back into harness again.\"\n\n\"If you'd rather wait, if you think you'll be more fit to-morrow or the\nday after, we'll wait.  There's no real hurry.  I just thought----\"\n\nBut Mrs. McChesney led the way across the hall that separated her\noffice from her partner's.  Halfway across, she stopped and surveyed\nthe big, bright, busy main office, with its clacking typewriters and\nrustle and crackle of papers and its air of concentration.\n\n\"Why, you've run up a partition there between Miss Casey's desk and the\nworkroom door, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes; it's much better that way.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course.  And--why, where are the boys' desks? Spalding's and\nHutchinson's, and--they're all gone!\"  She turned in amazement.\n\n\"Break it to me!  Aren't we using traveling men any more?\"\n\nBuck laughed his low, pleasant laugh.\n\n\"Oh, yes; but I thought their desks belonged somewhere else than in the\nmain office.  They're now installed in the little room between the shop\nand Healy's office.  Close quarters, but better than having them out\nhere where they were inclined to neglect their reports in order to\nshine in the eyes of that pretty new stenographer.  There are one or\ntwo other changes.  I hope you'll approve of them.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I shall,\" replied Emma McChesney, a little stiffly.\n\nIn Buck's office, she settled back in her chair to watch him as he\narranged neat sheaves of papers for her inspection.  Her eyes traveled\nfrom his keen, eager face to the piles of paper and back again.\n\n\"Tell me, did you hit it off with the Ella Sweeneys and the Sadie\nHarrises of the great Middle West?  Is business as bad as the howlers\nsay it is?  You said something last night about a novelty bifurcated\nskirt.  Was that the new designer's idea?  How have the early buyers\ntaken to it?\"\n\nBuck crooked an elbow over his head in self-defense.\n\n\"Stop it!  You make me feel like Rheims cathedral.  Don't bombard until\nnegotiations fail.\"\n\nHe handed her the first sheaf of papers.  But, before she began to\nread:  \"I'll say this  much.  Miss Sharp, of Berg Brothers, Omaha--the\none you warned against as the human cactus--had me up for dinner.\nWell, I know you don't, but it's true.  Her father and I hit it off\njust like that.  He's a character, that old boy. Ever meet him?  No?\nAnd Miss Sharp told me something about herself that explains her\nporcupine pose.  That poor child was engaged to a chap who was killed\nin the Spanish-American war, and she----\"\n\n\"Kate Sharp!\" interrupted Emma McChesney.  \"Why, T. A. Buck, in all her\nvinegary, narrow life, that girl has never had a beau, much less----\"\n\nBuck's eyebrows came up slightly.\n\n\"Emma McChesney, you haven't developed--er--claws, have you?\"\n\nWith a gasp, Emma McChesney plunged into the papers before her. For ten\nminutes, the silence of the room was unbroken except for the crackling\nof papers.  Then Emma McChesney put down the first sheaf and looked up\nat her business partner.\n\n\"Is that a fair sample?\" she demanded.\n\n\"Very,\" answered T. A. Buck, and handed her another set.\n\nAnother ten minutes of silence.  Emma McChesney reached out a hand for\nstill another set of papers.  The pink of repressed excitement was\ntinting her cheeks.\n\n\"They're--they're all like this?\"\n\n\"Practically, yes.\"\n\nMrs. McChesney faced him, her eyes wide, her breath coming fast.\n\n\"T. A. Buck,\" she slapped the papers before her smartly with the back\nof her hand, \"this means you've broken our record for Middle Western\nsales!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said T. A., quietly.  \"Dad would have enjoyed a morning like\nthis, wouldn't he?\"\n\nEmma McChesney stood up.\n\n\"Enjoyed it!  He is enjoying it.  Don't tell me that T. A., Senior,\njust because he is no longer on earth, has failed to get the joy of\nknowing that his son has realized his fondest dreams. Why, I can feel\nhim here in this room, I can see those bright brown eyes of his\ntwinkling behind his glasses.  Not know it!  Of course he knows it.\"\n\nBuck looked down at the desk, smiling curiously.\n\n\"D'you know, I felt that way, too.\"\n\nSuddenly Emma McChesney began to laugh.  It was not all mirth--that\nlaugh.  Buck waited.\n\n\"And to think that I--I kindly and patronizingly handed you a little\nbook full of tips on how to handle Western buyers, 'The Salesman's\nWho's Who'--I, who used to think I was the witch of the West when it\ncame to selling!  You, on your first selling-trip, have made me look\nlike--like a shoe-string peddler.\"\n\nBuck put out a hand suddenly.\n\n\"Don't say that, Emma.  I--somehow it takes away all the pleasure.\"\n\n\"It's true.  And now that I know, it explains a lot of things that I've\nbeen puzzling about in the last twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"What kind of things?\"\n\n\"The way you look and act and think.  The way you carry your head.  The\nway you sit in a chair.  The very words you use, your gestures, your\nintonations.  They're different.\"\n\nT. A. Buck, busy with his cigar, laughed a little self-consciously.\n\n\"Oh, nonsense!\" he said.  \"You're imagining things.\"\n\nWhich remark, while not a particularly happy one, certainly was not in\nitself so unfortunate as to explain why Mrs. McChesney should have\nturned rather suddenly and bolted into her own office across the hall\nand closed the door behind her.\n\nT. A. Buck, quite cool and unruffled, viewed her sudden departure\nquizzically.  Then he took his cigar from his mouth and stood eying it\na moment with more attention, perhaps, than it deserved, in spite of\nits fine aroma.  When he put it back between his lips and sat down at\nhis desk once more he was smiling ever so slightly.\n\nThen began a new order of things in the offices of the T. A. Buck\nFeatherloom Petticoat Company.  Feet that once had turned quite as a\nmatter of course toward the door marked \"MRS. MCCHESNEY,\" now took the\ndirection of the door opposite--and that door bore the name of Buck.\nThose four months of Mrs. McChesney's absence had put her partner to\nthe test.  That acid test had washed away the accumulated dross of\nyears and revealed the precious metal beneath.  T. A. Buck had proved\nto be his father's son.\n\nIf Mrs. McChesney noticed that the head office had miraculously moved\nacross the hall, if her sharp ears marked that the many feet that once\nhad paused at her door now stopped at the door opposite, if she\nrealized that instead of, \"I'd like your opinion on this, Mrs.\nMcChesney,\" she often heard the new, \"I'll ask Mr. Buck,\" she did not\nshow it by word or sign.\n\nThe first of October found buyers still flocking into New York from\nevery State in the country.  Shrewd men and women, these--bargain\nhunters on a grand scale.  Armed with the long spoon of business\nknowledge, they came to skim the cream from factory and workroom\nproducts set forth for their inspection.\n\nFor years, it had been Emma McChesney's quiet boast that of those whose\nbusiness brought them to the offices and showrooms of the T. A. Buck\nFeatherloom Petticoat Company, the foremost insisted on dealing only\nwith her.  She was proud of her following.  She liked their loyalty.\nTheir preference for her was the subtlest compliment that was in their\npower to pay.  Ethel Morrissey, whose friendship dated back to the days\nwhen Emma McChesney had sold Featherlooms through the Middle West, used\nto say laughingly, her plump, comfortable shoulders shaking, \"Emma, if\nyou ever give me away by telling how many years I've been buying\nFeatherlooms of you, I'll--I'll call down upon you the spinster's\ncurse.\"\n\nEarly Monday morning, Mrs. McChesney, coming down the hall from the\nworkroom, encountered Miss Ella Sweeney, of Klein & Company, Des\nMoines, Iowa, stepping out of the elevator.  A very skittish Miss\nSweeney, rustling, preening, conscious of her dangling black earrings\nand her Robespierre collar and her beauty-patch.  Emma McChesney met\nthis apparition with outstretched, welcoming hand.\n\n\"Ella Sweeney!  Well, I'd almost given you up.  You're late this fall.\nCome into my office.\"\n\nShe led the way, not noticing that Miss Sweeney came reluctantly, her\neyes on the closed door across the way.\n\n\"Sit down,\" said Emma McChesney, and pulled a chair nearer her desk.\n\"No; wait a minute!  Let me look at you.  Now, Ella, don't try to tell\nme that THAT dress came from Des Moines, Iowa! Do I!  Why, child, it's\ndistinctive!\"\n\nMiss Sweeney, still standing, smiled a  pleased but rather preoccupied\nsmile.  Her eyes roved toward the door.\n\nEmma McChesney, radiating good will and energy, went on:\n\n\"Wait till you see our new samples!  You'll buy a million dollars'\nworth.  Just let me lead you to our new Walk-Easy bifurcated skirt.  We\ncall it the 'one-stepper's delight.'\" She put a hand on Ella Sweeney's\narm, preparatory to guiding her to the showrooms in the rear.  But Miss\nSweeney's strange reluctance grew into resolve.  A blush, as real as it\nwas unaccustomed, arose to her bepowdered cheeks.\n\n\"Is--I--that is--Mr. Buck is in, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Mr. Buck?  Oh, yes, he's in.\"\n\nMiss Sweeney's eyes sought the closed door across the hall.\n\n\"Is that--his office?\"\n\nEmma McChesney stiffened a little.  Her eyes narrowed thoughtfully.\n\"You have guessed it,\" she said crisply.  \"Mr. Buck's name is on the\ndoor, and you are looking at it.\"\n\nMiss Sweeney looked down, looked up, twiddled the chain about her neck.\n\n\"You want to see Mr. Buck?\" asked Emma McChesney quietly.\n\nMiss Sweeney simpered down at her glove-tips, fluttered her eyelids.\n\n\"Well--yes--I--I--you see, I bought of him this year, and when you buy\nof a person, why, naturally, you----\"\n\n\"Naturally; I understand.\"\n\nShe walked across the hall, threw open the door, and met T. A. Buck's\nglance coolly.\n\n\"Mr. Buck, Miss Sweeney, of Des Moines, is here, and I'm sure you want\nto see her.  This way, Miss Sweeney.\"\n\nMiss Sweeney, sidling, blushing, fluttering, teetered in.  Emma\nMcChesney, just before she closed the door, saw a little spasm cross\nBuck's face.  It was gone so quickly, and a radiant smile sat there so\nreassuringly, that she wondered if she had not been mistaken, after\nall.  He had advanced, hand outstretched, with:\n\n\"Miss Sweeney!  It--it's wonderful to see you again!  You're\nlooking----\"\n\nThe closed door stifled the rest.  Emma McChesney, in her office across\nthe way, stood a moment in the center of the room, her hand covering\nher eyes.  The hardy chrysanthemums still glowed sunnily from their\nvase.  The little room was very quiet except for the ticking  of the\nsmart, leather-encased clock on the desk.\n\nThe closed door shut out factory and office sounds.  And Emma McChesney\nstood with one hand over her eyes.  So Napoleon might have stood after\nWaterloo.\n\nAfter this first lesson, Mrs. McChesney did not err again.  When, two\ndays later, Miss Sharp, of Berg Brothers, Omaha, breezed in, looking\nstrangely juvenile and distinctly anticipatory, Emma greeted her\nsmilingly and waved her toward the door opposite. Miss Sharp, the\nerstwhile bristling, was strangely smooth and sleek.  She glanced ever\nso softly, sighed ever so flutteringly.\n\n\"Working side by side with him, seeing him day after day, how have you\nbeen able to resist him?\"\n\nEmma McChesney was only human, after all.\n\n\"By remembering that this is a business house, not a matrimonial\nparlor.\"\n\nThe dart found no lodging place in Miss Sharp's sleek armor.  She\nseemed scarcely to have heard.\n\n\"My dear,\" she whispered, \"his eyes!  And his manner!  You must\nbe--whatchamaycallit--adamant.  Is that the way you pronounce it?  You\nknow what I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied Emma McChesney evenly, \"I--know what you mean.\"\n\nShe told herself that she was justified in the righteous contempt which\nshe felt for this sort of thing.  A heart-breaker!  A cheap\nlady-killer!  Whereupon in walked Sam Bloom, of the Paris Emporium,\nDuluth, one of Mrs. McChesney's stanchest admirers and a long-tried\nbusiness friend.\n\nThe usual thing:  \"Younger than ever, Mrs. McChesney!  You're a\nwonder--yes, you are!  How's business?  Same here.  Going to have lunch\nwith me to-day?\"  Then:  \"I'll just run in and see Buck. Say, where's\nhe been keeping himself all these years?  Chip off the old block, that\nboy.\"\n\nSo he had the men, too!\n\nIt was in this frame of mind that Miss Ethel Morrissey found her on the\nmorning that she came into New York on her semi-annual buying-trip.\nEthel Morrissey, plump, matronly-looking, quiet, with her hair fast\ngraying at the sides, had nothing of the skittish Middle Western buyer\nabout her.  She might have passed for the mother of a brood of six if\nit were not for her eyes--the shrewd, twinkling, far-sighted, reckoning\neyes of the business woman.  She and Emma McChesney had been friends\nfrom the day that Ethel Morrissey had bought her first cautious bill of\nFeatherlooms.  Her love for Emma McChesney had much of the maternal in\nit.  She felt a personal pride in Emma McChesney's work, her success,\nher clean reputation, her life of self-denial for her son Jock.  When\nEthel Morrissey was planned by her Maker, she had not been meant to be\nwasted on the skirt-and-suit department of a small-town store.  That\nbroad, gracious breast had been planned as a resting-place for heads in\nneed of comfort. Those plump, firm arms were meant to enfold the weak\nand distressed.  Those capable hands should have smoothed troubled\nheads and patted plump cheeks, instead of wasting their gifts in\nfolding piles of petticoats and deftly twitching a plait or a tuck into\nplace.  She was playing Rosalind in buskins when she should have been\ncast for the Nurse.\n\nShe entered Emma McChesney's office, now, in her quiet blue suit and\nher neat hat, and she  looked very sane and cheerful and rosy-cheeked\nand dependable.  At least, so Emma McChesney thought, as she kissed\nher, while the plump arms held her close.\n\nEthel Morrissey, the hugging process completed, held her off and eyed\nher.\n\n\"Well, Emma McChesney, flourish your Featherlooms for me.  I want to\nbuy and get it over, so we can talk.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that you want to buy of me?\" asked Emma McChesney, a\nlittle wearily.\n\n\"What's the joke?\"\n\n\"I'm not joking.  I thought that perhaps you might prefer to see Mr.\nBuck this trip.\"\n\nEthel Morrissey placed one forefinger under Emma McChesney's chin and\nturned that lady's face toward her and gazed at her long and\nthoughtfully--the most trying test of courage in the world, that, to\none whose eyes fear meeting yours.  Emma McChesney, bravest of women,\ntried to withstand it, and failed.  The next instant her head lay on\nEthel Morrissey's broad breast, her hands were clutching the plump\nshoulders, her cheek was being patted soothingly by the kind hands.\n\n\"Now, now--what is it, dear?  Tell Ethel.  Yes; I do know, but tell me,\nanyway.  It'll do you good.\"\n\nAnd Emma McChesney told her.  When she had finished:\n\n\"You bathe your eyes, Emma, and put on your hat and we'll eat. Oh, yes,\nyou will.  A cup of tea, anyway.  Isn't there some little cool fool\nplace where I can be comfortable on a hot day like this--where we can\ntalk comfortably?  I've got at least an hour's conversation in me.\"\n\nWith the first sip of her first cup of tea, Ethel Morrissey began to\nunload that burden of conversation.\n\n\"Emma, this is the best thing that could have happened to you. Oh, yes,\nit is.  The queer thing about it is that it didn't happen sooner.  It\nwas bound to come.  You know, Emma, the Lord lets a woman climb just so\nhigh up the mountain of success.  And then, when she gets too cocky,\nwhen she begins to measure her wits and brain and strength against that\nof men, and finds herself superior, he just taps her smartly on the\nhead and shins, so that she stumbles, falls, and rolls down a few miles\non the road she has traveled so painfully.  He does it just as a gentle\nreminder to her that she's  only a woman, after all.  Oh, I know all\nabout this feminist talk.  But this thing's been proven. Look at what\nhappened to--to Joan of Arc, and Becky Sharp, and Mary Queen of Scots,\nand--yes, I have been spending my evenings reading.  Now, stop laughing\nat your old Ethel, Emma McChesney!\"\n\n\"You meant me to laugh, dear old thing.  I don't feel much like it,\nthough.  I don't see why I should be reminded of my lowly state.\nHeaven knows I haven't been so terrifically pleased with myself!  Of\ncourse, that South American trip was--well, gratifying.  But I earned\nit.  For ten years I lived with head in a sample-trunk, didn't I?  I\nworked hard enough to win the love of all these Westerners.  It wasn't\nall walking dreamily down Main Street, strewing Featherlooms along my\npath.\"\n\nEthel Morrissey stirred her second cup of tea, sipped, stirred, smiled,\nthen reached over and patted Emma McChesney's hand.\n\n\"Emma, I'm a wise old party, and I can see that it isn't all pique with\nyou.  It's something else--something deeper.  Oh, yes, it is!  Now let\nme tell you what happened when T. A. Buck invaded your old-time\nterritory.  I was busy up in my department the morning he came in.  I\nhad my head in a rack of coats, and a henny customer waiting.  But I\nsensed something stirring, and I stuck my head out of the coat-rack in\nwhich I was fumbling.  The department was aflutter like a poultry-yard.\nEvery woman in it, from the little new Swede stock-girl to Gladys\nHemingway, who is only working to wear out her old clothes, was\nstanding with her face toward the elevator, and on her face a look that\nwould make the ordinary door-mat marked 'Welcome' seem like an insult.\nI kind of smoothed my back hair, because I knew that only one thing\ncould bring that look into a woman's face.  And down the aisle came a\ntall, slim, distinguished-looking, wonderfully tailored,\nchamois-gloved, walking-sticked Fifth Avenue person with EYES! Of\ncourse, I knew.  But the other girls didn't.  They just sort of fell\nback at his approach, smitten.  He didn't even raise an eyebrow to do\nit.  Now, Emma, I'm not exaggerating.  I know what effect he had on me\nand my girls, and, for that matter, every other man or woman in the\nstore.  Why, he was a dream realized to most of 'em.  These shrewd,\nclever buyer-girls know plenty of men--business men of the slap-bang,\nhorn-blowing, bluff, good-natured, hello-kid kind--the kind that takes\nyou out to dinner and blows cigar smoke in your face.  Along comes this\nchap, elegant, well dressed and not even conscious of it, polished,\nsuave, smooth, low-voiced, well bred.  Why, when he spoke to a girl, it\nwas the subtlest kind of flattery.  Can you see little Sadie Harris, of\nDuluth, drawing a mental comparison between Sam Bloom, the\nstore-manager, and this fascinating devil--Sam, red-faced, loud voiced,\nshirt-sleeving it around the sample room, his hat pushed 'way back on\nhis head, chewing his cigar like mad, and wild-eyed for fear he's\nbuying wrong?  Why, child, in our town, nobody carries a cane except\nthe Elks when they have their annual parade, and old man Schwenkel,\nwho's lame. And yet we all accepted that yellow walking-stick of\nBuck's.  It belonged to him.  There isn't a skirt-buyer in the Middle\nWest that doesn't dream of him all night and push Featherlooms in the\nstore all day.  Emma, I'm old and fat and fifty, but when I had dinner\nwith him at the Manitoba House that evening, I caught myself making\neyes at him, knowing that every woman in the dining-room would have\ngiven her front teeth to be where I was.\"\n\nAfter which extensive period, Ethel Morrissey helped herself to her\nthird cup of tea.  Emma McChesney relaxed a little and laughed a\ntremulous little laugh.\n\n\"Oh, well, I suppose I must not hope to combat such formidable rivals\nas walking-sticks, chamois gloves, and EYES.  My business arguments are\nfutile compared to those.\"\n\nEthel Morrissey delivered herself of a last shot.\n\n\"You're wrong, Emma.  Those things helped him, but they didn't sell his\nline.  He sold Featherlooms out of salesmanship, and because he sounded\nconvincing and sincere and businesslike--and he had the samples.  It\nwasn't all bunk.  It was three-quarters business.  Those two make an\ninvincible combination.\"\n\nAn hour later, Ethel Morrissey was shrewdly selecting her winter line\nof Featherlooms from the stock in the showrooms of the T. A. Buck\nCompany.  They went about their business transaction, these two, with\nthe cool abruptness of men, speaking little, and then only of prices,\ndiscounts, dating, shipping.   Their luncheon conversation of an hour\nbefore seemed an impossibility.\n\n\"You'll have dinner with me to-night?\" Emma asked.  \"Up at my\napartment, all cozy?\"\n\n\"Not to-night, dearie.  I'll be in bed by eight.  I'm not the girl I\nused to be.  Time was when a New York buying-trip was a vacation.  Now\nit's a chore.\"\n\nShe took Emma McChesney's hand and patted it.\n\n\"If you've got something real nice for dinner, though, and feel like\ncompany, why don't you ask--somebody else that's lonesome.\"\n\nAfter which, Ethel Morrissey laughed her wickedest and waved a sudden\ngood-by with a last word about seeing her to-morrow.\n\nEmma McChesney, her color high, entered her office.  It was five\no'clock.  She cleared her desk in half an hour, breathed a sigh of\nweariness, reached for hat and jacket, donned them, and, turning out\nher lights, closed her door behind her for the day. At that same\ninstant, T. A. Buck slammed his own door and walked briskly down the\nhall.  They met at the elevator.\n\nThey descended in silence.  The street gained, they paused uncertainly.\n\n\"Won't you stay down and have dinner with me to-night, Emma?\"\n\n\"Thanks so much, T. A. Not to-night.\"\n\n\"I'm--sorry.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\n\"Good night.\"\n\nShe turned away.  He stood there, in the busy street, looking\nirresolutely and not at all eagerly in the direction of his club,\nperhaps, or his hotel, or whatever shelter he sought after business\nhours.  Something in his attitude--the loneliness of it, the\nuncertainty, the indecision--smote Emma McChesney with a great pang.\nShe came swiftly back.\n\n\"I wish you'd come home to dinner with me.  I don't know what Annie'll\ngive us.  Probably bread pudding.  She does, when she's left to her own\ndevices.  But I--I wish you would.\"  She looked up at him almost shyly.\n\nT. A. Buck took Emma McChesney's arm in a rather unnecessarily firm\ngrip and propelled her, surprised and protesting, in the direction of\nthe nearest vacant taxi.\n\n\"But, T. A.!  This is idiotic!  Why take a cab to go home from the\noffice on a--a week day?\"\n\n\"In with you!  Besides, I never have a chance to take one from the\noffice on Sunday, do I?  Does Annie always cook enough for two?\"\n\nApparently Annie did.  Annie was something of a witch, in her way.  She\nwhisked about, wrought certain changes, did things with asparagus and\nmayonnaise, lighted the rose-shaded table-candles. No one noticed that\ndinner was twenty minutes late.\n\nTogether they admired the great mahogany buffet that Emma had\nmiraculously found space for in the little dining-room.\n\n\"It glows like a great, deep ruby, doesn't it?\" she said proudly.  \"You\nshould see Annie circle around it with the carpet-sweeper.  She knows\none bump would be followed by instant death.\"\n\nLooking back on it, afterward, they remembered that the dinner was a\nvery silent one.  They did not notice their wordlessness at the time.\nOnce, when the chops came on, Buck said absently,\n\n\"Oh, I had those for l----\"  Then he stopped abruptly.\n\nEmma McChesney smiled.\n\n\"Your mother trained you well,\" she said.\n\nThe October night had grown cool.  Annie had lighted a wood fire in the\nliving-room.\n\n\"That was what attracted me to this apartment in the first place,\" Mrs.\nMcChesney said, as they left the dining-room.  \"A fireplace--a\npractical, real, wood-burning fireplace in a New York apartment!  I'd\nhave signed the lease if the plaster had been falling in chunks and the\nbathtub had been zinc.\"\n\n\"That's because fireplaces mean home--in our minds,\" said Buck.\n\nHe sat looking into the heart of the glow.  There fell another of those\ncomfortable silences.\n\n\"T. A., I--I want to tell you that I know I've been acting the cat ever\nsince I got home from South America and found that you had taken\ncharge.  You see, you had spoiled me.  The thing that has happened to\nme is the thing that always happens to those who assume to be\ndictators.  I just want you to know, now, that I'm glad and proud and\nhappy because you have come into your own.  It hurt me just at first.\nThat was the pride of me.  I'm quite over that now.  You're not only\npresident of the T. A. Buck Company in name.  You're its actual head.\nAnd that's as it should be.  Long live the King!\"\n\nBuck sat silent a moment.  Then,\n\n\"I had to do it, Emma.\"  She looked up. \"You have a wonderful brain,\"\nsaid Buck then, and the two utterances seemed connected in his mind.\n\nThey seemed to bring no great satisfaction to the woman to whom he\naddressed them, however.  She thanked him dryly, as women do when their\nbrain is dragged into an intimate conversation.\n\n\"But,\" said Buck, and suddenly stood up, looking at her very intently,\n\"it isn't for your mind that I love you this minute. I love you for\nyour eyes, Emma, and for your mouth--you have the tenderest, most\nwomanly-sweet mouth in the world--and for your hair, and the way your\nchin curves.  I love you for your throat-line, and for the way you walk\nand talk and sit, for the way you look at me, and for the way you don't\nlook at me.\"\n\nHe reached down and gathered Emma McChesney, the alert, the aggressive,\nthe capable, into his arms, quite as men gather the clingingest kind of\nwoman.  \"And now suppose you tell me just why and how you love me.\"\n\nAnd Emma McChesney told him.\n\nWhen, at last, he was leaving,\n\n\"Don't you think,\" asked Emma McChesney, her hands on his shoulders,\n\"that you overdid the fascination thing just the least leetle bit there\non the road?\"\n\n\"Well, but you told me to entertain them, didn't you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" reluctantly; \"but I didn't tell you to consecrate your life to\n'em.  The ordinary fat, middle-aged, every-day traveling man will never\nbe able to sell Featherlooms in the Middle West again.  They won't have\n'em.  They'll never be satisfied with anything less than John Drew\nafter this.\"\n\n\"Emma McChesney, you're not marrying me because a lot of overdressed,\ngiggling, skittish old girls have taken a fancy to make eyes at me, are\nyou!\"\n\nEmma McChesney stood up very straight and tall.\n\n\"I'm marrying you, T. A., because you are a great, big, fine,\nupstanding, tender, wonderful----\"\n\n\"Oh, well, then that's all right,\" broke in Buck, a little tremulously.\n\nEmma McChesney's face grew serious.\n\n\"But promise me one thing, T. A.  Promise me that when you come home\nfor dinner at night, you'll never say, 'Good heavens, I had that for\nlunch!'\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\nA CLOSER CORPORATION\n\nFront offices resemble back kitchens in this: they have always an ear\nat the keyhole, an eye at the crack, a nose in the air.  But\n\nbetween the ordinary front office and the front office of the T. A.\nBuck Featherloom Petticoat Company there was a difference. The\nemployees at Buck's--from Emil, the errand boy, to old Pop Henderson,\nwho had started as errand boy himself twenty-five years\nbefore--possessed the quality of loyalty.  They were loyal to the\nmemory of old man Buck, because they had loved and respected him.  They\nwere loyal to Mrs. Emma McChesney, because she was Mrs. Emma McChesney\n(which amounts to the same reason). They were loyal to T. A. Buck,\nbecause he was his father's son.\n\nFor three weeks the front office had been bewildered.  From\nbewilderment it passed to worry.  A worried, bewildered front office is\nnot an efficient front office.  Ever since Mrs. McChesney had come off\nthe road, at the death of old T. A. Buck, to assume the secretaryship\nof the company which she had served faithfully for ten years, she had\nset an example for the entire establishment.  She was the pacemaker.\nEvery day of her life she figuratively pressed the electric button that\nset the wheels to whirring.  At nine A.M., sharp, she appeared, erect,\nbrisk, alert, vibrating energy.  Usually, the office staff had not yet\nswung into its gait.  In a desultory way, it had been getting into its\nsateen sleevelets, adjusting its eye-shades, uncovering its typewriter,\nopening its ledgers, bringing out its files. Then, down the hall, would\ncome the sound of a firm, light, buoyant step.  An electric thrill\nwould pass through the front office.  Then the sunny, sincere, \"Good\nmorning!\"\n\n\"'Morning, Mrs. McChesney!\" the front office would chorus back.\n\nThe day had begun for the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company.\n\nHortense, the blond stenographer (engaged to the shipping-clerk),\nnoticed it first.  The psychology of that is interesting. Hortense knew\nthat by nine-thirty Mrs. McChesney's desk would be clear and that the\nbuzzer would summon her.  Hortense didn't mind taking dictation from T.\nA. Buck, though his method was hesitating and jerky, and he was likely\nto employ quite casually a baffling and unaccustomed word, over which\nHortense's scampering pencil would pause, struggle desperately, then\nrace on.  Hortense often was in for a quick, furtive session with her\npocket-dictionary after one of T. A.'s periods.  But with Mrs.\nMcChesney, dictation was a joy.  She knew what she wanted to say and\nshe always said it.  The words she used were short, clean-cut,\nmeaningful Anglo-Saxon words.  She never used received when she could\nuse got.  Hers was the rapid-fire-gun method, each word sharp, well\ntimed, efficient.\n\nImagine, then, Hortense staring wide-eyed and puzzled at a floundering,\nhesitating, absent-minded Mrs. McChesney--a Mrs. McChesney strangely\nstarry as to eyes, strangely dreamy as to mood, decidedly deficient as\nto dictation.  Imagine a Hortense with pencil poised in air a full five\nminutes, waiting until Mrs. McChesney should come to herself with a\nstart, frown, smile vaguely, pass a hand over her eyes, and say, \"Let\nme see--where was I?\"\n\n\"'And we find, on referring to your order, that the goods you\nmention----'\" Hortense would prompt patiently.\n\n\"Oh, yes, of course,\" with an effort.  Hortense was beginning to grow\nalarmed.\n\nIn T. A. Buck's office, just across the hall, the change was quite as\nnoticeable, but in another way.  His leisurely drawl was gone.  His\ndeliberate manner was replaced by a brisk, quick-thinking,\nquick-speaking one.  His words were brief and to the point.  He seemed\nto be riding on the crest of an excitement-wave.  And, as he dictated,\nhe smiled.\n\nHortense stood it for a week.  Then she unburdened herself to Miss\nKelly, the assistant bookkeeper.  Miss Kelly evinced no surprise at her\ndisclosures.\n\n\"I was just talking about it to Pop yesterday.  She acts worried,\ndoesn't she?  And yet, not exactly worried, either.  Do you suppose it\ncan be that son of hers--what's his name?  Jock.\"\n\nHortense shook her head.\n\n\"No; he's all right.  She had a letter from him yesterday.  He's got a\ngrand position in Chicago, and he's going to marry that girl he was so\nstuck on here.  And it isn't that, either, because Mrs. McChesney likes\nher.  I can tell by the way she talks about her.  I ought to know.\nLook how Henry's ma acted toward me when we were first engaged!\"\n\nThe front office buzzed with it.  It crept into the workroom--into the\nshipping-room.  It penetrated the frowsy head of Jake, the\nelevator-man.  As the days went on and the tempo of the front office\nslackened with that of the two bright little inner offices, only one\nmember of the whole staff remained unmoved, incurious, taciturn.  Pop\nHenderson listened, one scant old eyebrow raised knowingly, a whimsical\nhalf-smile screwing up his wrinkled face.\n\nAt the end of three weeks, Hortense, with that display of temperament\nso often encountered in young ladies of her profession, announced in\ndesperation that, if this thing kept on, she was going to forget\nherself and jeopardize her position by demanding to know outright what\nthe trouble was.\n\nFrom the direction of Pop Henderson's inky retreat, there came the\nsound of a dry chuckle.  Pop Henderson had been chuckling in just that\nway for three weeks, now.  It was getting on the nerves of his\ncolleagues.\n\n\"If you ever spring the joke that's kept you giggling for a month,\"\nsnapped Hortense, \"it'll break up the office.\"\n\nPop Henderson removed his eye-shade very deliberately, passed his thin,\ncramped old hand over his scant gray locks to his bald spot, climbed\ndown stiffly from his stool, ambled to the center of the room, and,\nhead cocked like a knowing old brown sparrow, regarded the pert\nHortense over his spectacles and under his spectacles and, finally,\nthrough his spectacles.\n\n\"Young folks now 'days,\" began Pop Henderson dryly, \"are so darned cute\nand knowin' that when an old fellow cuts in ahead of 'em for once, he\nlikes to hug the joke to himself a while before he springs it.\"  There\nwas no acid in his tone.  He was beaming very benignantly down upon the\nlittle blond stenographer.  \"You say that Mrs. Mack is\nabsent-minded-like and dreamy, and that young T. A. acts like he'd\nswallowed an electric battery.  Well, when it comes to that, I've seen\nyou many a time, when you didn't know any one was lookin', just sitting\nthere at your typewriter, with your hands kind of poised halfway, and\nyour lips sort of parted, and your eyes just gazing away somewhere off\nin the distance for fifteen minutes at a stretch.  And out there in the\nshipping-room Henry's singing like a whole minstrel troupe all day\nlong, when he isn't whistlin' so loud you can hear him over 's far as\nEighth Avenue.\"  Then, as the red surged up through the girl's fair\nskin, \"Well?\" drawled old Pop Henderson, and the dry chuckle threatened\nagain.  \"We-e-ell?\"\n\n\"Why, Pop Henderson!\" exploded Miss Kelly from her cage.\n\"Why--Pop--Henderson!\"\n\nIn those six words the brisk and agile-minded Miss Kelly expressed the\nsurprise and the awed conviction of the office staff.\n\nPop Henderson trotted over to the water-cooler, drew a brimming glass,\ndrank it off, and gave vent to a great exhaust of breath. He tried not\nto strut as he crossed back to his desk, climbed his stool, adjusted\nhis eye-shade, and, with a last throaty chuckle, plunged into his books\nagain.\n\nBut his words already were working their wonders.  The office, after\nthe first shock, was flooded with a new atmosphere--a subtle, pervasive\nair of hushed happiness, of tender solicitude. It went about like a\nmother who has found her child asleep at play, and who steals away\natiptoe, finger on lip, lips smiling tenderly.\n\nThe delicate antennae of Emma McChesney's mind sensed the change.\n\nPerhaps she read something in the glowing eyes of her sister-in-love,\nHortense.  Perhaps she caught a new tone in Miss Kelly's voice or the\nforewoman's.  Perhaps a whisper from the outer office reached her desk.\nThe very afternoon of Pop Henderson's electrifying speech, Mrs.\nMcChesney crossed to T. A. Buck's office, shut the door after her,\nlowered her voice discreetly, and said,\n\n\"T. A., they're on.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\n\"Nothing.  That is, nothing definite.  No man-reason.  Just a\nwoman-reason.\"\n\nT. A. Buck strolled over to her, smiling.\n\n\"I haven't known you all this time without having learned that that's\nreason enough.  And if they really do know, I'm glad.\"\n\n\"But we didn't want them to know.  Not yet--until--until just before\nthe----\"\n\nT. A. Buck laid his hands lightly on Emma McChesney's shoulders. Emma\nMcChesney promptly reached up and removed them.\n\n\"There you are!\" exclaimed Buck, and rammed the offending hands into\nhis pockets.\n\n\"That's why I'm glad they know--if they really do know.  I'm no actor.\nI'm a skirt-and-lingerie manufacturer.  For the last six weeks, instead\nof being allowed to look at you with the expression that a man\nnaturally wears when he's looking at the woman he's going to marry,\nwhat have I had to do?  Glare, that's what!  Scowl!  Act like a captain\nof finance when I've felt like a Romeo!  I've had to be dry, terse,\nbusinesslike, when I was bursting with adjectives that had nothing to\ndo with business. You've avoided my office as you would a small-pox\ncamp.  You've greeted me with a what-can-I-do-for-you air when I've\ndared to invade yours.  You couldn't have been less cordial to a book\nagent.  If it weren't for those two hours you grant me in the evening,\nI'd--I'd blow up with a loud report, that's what. I'd----\"\n\n\"Now, now, T. A.!\" interrupted Emma McChesney soothingly, and patted\none gesticulating arm.  \"It has been a bit of a strain--for both of us.\nBut, you know, we agreed it would be best this way.  We've ten days\nmore to go.  Let's stick it out as we've begun.  It has been best for\nus, for the office, for the business.  The next time you find yourself\nchoked up with a stock of fancy adjectives, write a sonnet to me.  Work\n'em off that way.\"\n\nT. A. Buck stood silent a moment, regarding her with a concentration\nthat would have unnerved a woman less poised.\n\n\"Emma McChesney, when you talk like that, so coolly, so evenly, so--so\ndarned mentally, I sometimes wonder if you really----\"\n\n\"Don't say it, T. A. Because you don't mean it.  I've had to fight for\nmost of my happiness.  I've never before found it ready at hand.  I've\nalways had to dig for it with a shovel and a spade and a pickax, and\nthen blast.  I had almost twenty years of that--from the time I was\neighteen until I was thirty-eight. It taught me to take my happiness\nseriously and my troubles lightly.\"  She shut her eyes for a moment,\nand her voice was very low and very deep and very vibrant.  \"So, when\nI'm coolest and evenest and most mental, T. A., you may know that I've\nstruck gold.\"\n\nA great glow illumined Buck's fine eyes.  He took two quick steps in\nher direction.  But Emma McChesney, one hand on the door-knob, warned\nhim off with the other.\n\n\"Hey--wait a minute!\" pleaded Buck.\n\n\"Can't.  I've a fitting at the tailor's at three-thirty--my new suit.\nWait till you see it!\"\n\n\"The dickens you have!  But so have I\"--he jerked out his watch--\"at\nthree-thirty!  It's the suit I'm going to wear when I travel as a\nblushing bridegroom.\"\n\n\"So's mine.  And look here, T. A.!  We can't both leave this place for\na fitting.  It's absurd.  If this keeps on, it will break up the\nbusiness.  We'll have to get married one at a time--or, at least, get\nour trousseaux one at a time.  What's your suit?\"\n\n\"Sort of brown.\"\n\n\"Brown?  So's mine!  Good heavens, T. A., we'll look like a minstrel\ntroupe!\"\n\n\nBuck sighed resignedly.\n\n\"If I telephone my tailor that I can't make it until four-thirty, will\nyou promise to be back by that time?\"\n\n\"Yes; but remember, if your bride appears in a skirt that sags in the\nback or a coat that bunches across the shoulders, the crime will lie at\nyour door.\"\n\nSo it was that the lynx-eyed office staff began to wonder if, after\nall, Pop Henderson was the wizard that he had claimed to be.\n\nDuring working hours, Mrs. McChesney held rigidly to business. Her\nhandsome partner tried bravely to follow her example.  If he failed\noccasionally, perhaps Emma McChesney was not so displeased as she\npretended to be.  A business discussion, deeply interesting to both,\nwas likely to run thus:\n\nBuck, entering her office briskly, papers in hand:  \"Mrs.\nMcChesney--ahem!--I have here a letter from Singer & French, Columbus,\nOhio.  They ask for an extension.  They've had ninety days.\"\n\n\"That's enough.  That firm's slow pay, and always will be until old\nSinger has the good taste and common sense to retire.  It isn't because\nthe stock doesn't move.  Singer simply believes in not paying for\nanything until he has to.  If I were you, I'd write him that this is a\nbusiness house, not a charitable institution---- No, don't do that.  It\nisn't politic.  But you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"H'm; yes.\"  A silence.  \"Emma, that's a fiendishly becoming gown.\"\n\n\"Now, T. A.!\"\n\n\"But it is!  It--it's so kind of loose, and yet clinging, and those\nwhite collar-and-cuff things----\"\n\n\"T. A. Buck, I've worn this thing down to the office every day for a\nmonth.  It shines in the back.  Besides, you promised not to----\"\n\n\"Oh, darn it all, Emma, I'm human, you know!  How do you suppose I can\nstand here and look at you and not----\"\n\nEmma McChesney (pressing the buzzer that summons Hortense): \"You know,\nTim, I don't exactly hate you this morning, either. But business is\nbusiness.  Stop looking at me like that!\"  Then, to Hortense, in the\ndoorway:  \"Just take this letter, Miss Stotz-Singer & French, Columbus,\nOhio.  Dear Sirs:  Yours of the tenth at hand.  Period.  Regarding your\nrequest for further extension we wish to say that, in view of the\nfact----\"\n\nT. A. Buck, half resentful, half amused, wholly admiring, would\ndisappear.  But Hortense, eyes demurely cast down at her notebook, was\nnot deceived.\n\n\"Say,\" she confided to Miss Kelly, \"they think they've got me fooled.\nBut I'm wise.  Don't I know?  When Henry passes through the office\nhere, from the shipping-room, he looks at me just as cool and\nindifferent.  Before we announced it, we had you all guessing, didn't\nwe?  But I can see something back of that look that the rest of you\ncan't get.  Well, when Mr. Buck looks at her, I can see the same thing\nin his eyes.  Say, when it comes to seeing the love-light through the\nfog, I'm there with the spy-glass.\"\n\nIf Emma McChesney held herself well in leash during the busy day, she\nrelished her happiness none the less when she could allow herself the\nfull savor of it.  When a girl of eighteen she had married a man of the\nsort that must put whisky into his stomach before the machinery of his\nday would take up its creaking round.\n\nOut of the degradation of that marriage she had emerged triumphantly,\nsweet and unsullied, and she had succeeded in bringing her son, Jock\nMcChesney, out into the clear sunlight with her.\n\nThe evenings spent with T. A. Buck, the man of fine instincts, of\nbreeding, of proven worth, of rare tenderness, filled her with a great\npeace and happiness.  When doubts assailed her, it was not for herself\nbut for him.  Sometimes the fear would clutch her as they sat before\nthe fire in the sitting-room of her comfortable little apartment.  She\nwould voice those fears for the very joy of having them stilled.\n\n\"T. A., this is too much happiness.  I'm--I'm afraid.  After all,\nyou're a young man, though you are a bit older than I in actual years.\nBut men of your age marry girls of eighteen. You're handsome.  And\nyou've brains, family, breeding, money. Any girl in New York would be\nglad to marry you--those tall, slim, exquisite young girls.  Young!\nAnd well bred, and poised and fresh and sweet and lovable.  You see\nthem every day on Fifth Avenue, exquisitely dressed, entirely\ndesirable.  They make me feel--old--old and battered.  I've sold goods\non the road.  I've fought and worked and struggled.  And it has left\nits mark.  I did it for the boy, God bless him!  And I'm glad I did it.\nBut it put me out of the class of that girl you see on----\"\n\n\"Yes, Emma; you're not at all in the class with that girl you see every\nday on Fifth Avenue.  Fifth Avenue's full of her--hundreds of her,\nthousands of her.  Perhaps, five years ago, before I had worked side by\nside with you, I might have been attracted by that girl you see every\nday on Fifth Avenue.  You don't see a procession of Emma McChesneys\nevery day on Fifth Avenue--not by a long shot!  Why?  Because there's\nonly one of her.  She doesn't come in dozen lots.  I know that that\ngirl you see every day on Fifth Avenue is all that I deserve.  But, by\nsome heaven-sent miracle, I'm to have this Emma McChesney woman! I\ndon't know how it came to be true.  I don't deserve it.  But it is\ntrue, and that's enough for me.\"\n\nEmma McChesney would look up at him, eyes wet, mouth smiling.\n\n\"T. A., you're balm and myrrh and incense and meat and drink to me.  I\nwish I had words to tell you what I'm thinking now.  But I haven't.  So\nI'll just cover it up.  We both know it's there. And I'll tell you that\nyou make love like a 'movie' hero.  Yes, you do!  Better than a 'movie'\nhero, because, in the films, the heroine always has to turn to face the\ncamera, which makes it necessary for him to make love down the back of\nher neck.\"\n\nBut T. A. Buck was unsmiling.\n\n\"Don't trifle, Emma.  And don't think you can fool me that way. I\nhaven't finished.  I want to settle this Fifth Avenue creature for all\ntime.  What I have to say is this:  I think you are more\nattractive--finer, bigger, more rounded in character and manner,\nmellower, sweeter, sounder, with all your angles and corners rubbed\nsmooth, saner, better poised than any woman I have ever known.  And\nwhat I am to-day you have made me, directly and indirectly, by\nassociation and by actual orders, by suggestion, and by direct contact.\nWhat you did for Jock, purposefully and by force, you did for me, too.\nNot so directly, perhaps, but with the same result.  Emma McChesney,\nyou've made--actually made, molded, shaped, and turned out two men.\nYou're the greatest sculptor that ever lived.  You could make a\nscarecrow in a field get up and achieve.  Everywhere one sees women\nover-wrought, over-stimulated, eager, tense.  When there appears one\nwho has herself in leash, balanced, tolerant, poised, sane, composed,\nshe restores your faith in things.  You lean on her, spiritually.  I\nknow I need you more than you need me, Emma.  And I know you won't love\nme the less for that.  There--that's about all for this evening.\"\n\n\"I think,\" breathed Emma McChesney in a choked little voice, \"that\nthat's about--enough.\"\n\nTwo days before the date set for their very quiet wedding, they told\nthe heads of office and workroom.  Office and workroom, somewhat moist\nas to eye and flushed as to cheek and highly congratulatory, proved\ntheir knowingness by promptly presenting to their employers a very\ncostly and unbelievably hideous set of mantel ornaments and clock,\ncalculated to strike horror to the heart of any woman who has lovingly\nplanned the furnishing of her drawing-room.  Pop Henderson, after some\npreliminary wrestling with collar, necktie, spectacles, and voice,\nlaunched forth on a presentation speech that threatened to close down\nthe works for the day.  Emma McChesney heard it, tears in her eyes.  T.\nA. Buck gnawed his mustache.  And when Pop Henderson's cracked old\nvoice broke altogether in the passage that touched on his departed\nemployer, old T. A. Buck, and the great happiness that this occasion\nwould have brought him, Emma's hand met young T. A.'s and rested there.\nHortense and Henry, standing very close together all through the\nspeech, had, in this respect, anticipated their employers by several\nminutes.\n\nThey were to be away two weeks only.  No one knew just where, except\nthat some small part of the trip was to be spent on a flying visit to\nyoung Jock McChesney out in Chicago.  He himself was to be married very\nsoon.  Emma McChesney had rather startled her very good-looking\nhusband-to-be by whirling about at him with,\n\n\"T. A., do you realize that you're very likely to be a step-grandfather\nsome fine day not so far away!\"\n\nT. A. had gazed at her for a rather shocked moment, swallowed hard,\nsmiled, and said,\n\n\"Even that doesn't scare me, Emma.\"\n\nEverything had been planned down to the last detail.  Mrs. McChesney's\nlittle apartment had been subleased, and a very smart one taken and\nfurnished almost complete, with Annie installed in the kitchen and a\ndemure parlor-maid engaged.\n\n\"When we come back, we'll come home,\" T. A. Buck had said. \"Home!\"\n\nThere had been much to do, but it had all been done smoothly and\nexpertly, under the direction of these two who had learned how to plan,\ndirect, and carry out.\n\nThen, on the last day, Emma McChesney, visibly perturbed, entered her\npartner's office, a letter in her hand.\n\n\"This is ghastly!\" she exclaimed.\n\nBuck pulled out a chair for her.\n\n\"Klein cancel his order again?\"\n\n\"No.  And don't ask me to sit down.  Be thankful that I don't blow up.\"\n\n\"Is it as bad as that?\"\n\n\"Bad!  Here--read that!  No, don't read it; I'll tell you. It'll\nrelieve my feelings.  You know how I've been angling and scheming and\ncontriving and plotting for years to get an exclusive order from Gage &\nFosdick.  Of course we've had a nice little order every few months, but\nwhat's that from the biggest mail-order house in the world?  And now,\nout of a blue sky, comes this bolt from O'Malley, who buys our stuff,\nsaying that he's coming on the tenth--that's next week--that he's\nplanned to establish our line with their trade, and that he wants us to\nbe prepared for a record-breaking order.  I've fairly prayed for this.\nAnd now--what shall we do?\"\n\n\"Do?\"--smoothly--\"just write the gentleman and tell him you're busy\ngetting married this week and next, and that, by a singular\ncoincidence, your partner is similarly engaged; that our manager will\nattend to him with all care and courtesy, unless he can postpone his\ntrip until our return.  Suggest that he call around a week or two\nlater.\"\n\n\"T. A. Buck, I know it isn't considered good form to rage and glare at\none's fiance on the eve of one's wedding-day.  If this were a week\nearlier or a week later, I'd be tempted to--shake you!\"\n\nBuck stood up, came over to her, and laid a hand very gently on her\narm.  With the other hand he took the letter from her fingers.\n\n\"Emma, you're tired, and a little excited.  You've been under an\nunusual physical and mental strain for the last few weeks.  Give me\nthat letter.  I'll answer it.  This kind of thing\"--he held up the\nletter--\"has meant everything to you.  If it had not, where would I be\nto-day?  But to-night, Emma, it doesn't mean a thing.  Not--one thing.\"\n\nSlowly Emma McChesney's tense body relaxed.  A great sigh that had in\nit weariness and relief and acquiescence came from her. She smiled ever\nso faintly.\n\n\"I've been a ramrod so long it's going to be hard to learn to be a\nclinging vine.  I've been my own support for so many years, I don't use\na trellis very gracefully--yet.  But I think I'll get the hang of it\nvery soon.\"\n\nShe turned toward the door, crossed to her own office, looked all about\nat the orderly, ship-shape room that reflected her personality--as did\nany room she occupied.\n\n\"Just the same,\" she called out, over her shoulder, to Buck in the\ndoorway, \"I hate like fury to see that order slide.\"\n\nIn hat and coat and furs she stood a moment, her fingers on the\nelectric switch, her eyes very bright and wide.  The memories of ten\nyears, fifteen years, twenty years crowded up around her and filled the\nlittle room.  Some of them were golden and some of them were black; a\nfew had power to frighten her, even now.  So she turned out the light,\nstood for just another moment there in the darkness, then stepped out\ninto the hall, closed the door softly behind her, and stood face to\nface with the lettering on the glass panel of the door--the lettering\nthat spelled the name, \"MRS. MCCHESNEY.\"\n\nT. A. Buck watched her in silence.  She reached up with one wavering\nforefinger and touched each of the twelve letters, one after the other.\nThen she spread her hand wide, blotting out the second word.  And when\nshe turned away, one saw--she being Emma McChesney, and a woman, and\nvery tired and rather sentimental, and a bit hysterical and altogether\nhappy--that, though she was smiling, her eyes were wet.\n\n\nIn her ten years on the road, visiting town after town, catching\ntrains, jolting about in rumbling hotel 'buses or musty-smelling\nsmall-town hacks, living in hotels, good, bad, and indifferent, Emma\nMcChesney had come upon hundreds of rice-strewn, ribbon-bedecked bridal\ncouples.  She had leaned from her window at many a railway station to\nsee the barbaric and cruel old custom of bride-and-bridegroom baiting.\nShe had smiled very tenderly--and rather sadly, and hopefully,\ntoo--upon the boy and girl who rushed breathless into the car in a\nflurry of white streamers, flowers, old shoes, laughter, cheers, last\nmessages. Now, as in a dream, she found herself actually of these.  Of\nrice, old shoes, and badinage there had been none, it is true. She\nstood quietly by while Buck attended to their trunks, just as she had\nseen it done by hundreds of helpless little cotton-wool women who had\nnever checked a trunk in their lives--she, who had spent ten years of\nher life wrestling with trunks and baggagemen and porters.  Once there\nwas some trifling mistake--Buck's fault. Emma, with her experience of\nthe road, saw his error.  She could have set him right with a word.  It\nwas on the tip of her tongue. By sheer force of will she withheld that\nword, fought back the almost overwhelming inclination to take things in\nhand, set them right.  It was just an incident, almost trifling in\nitself.  But its import was tremendous, for her conduct, that moment,\nshaped the happiness of their future life together.\n\nEmma had said that there would be no rude awakenings for them, no\nstartling shocks.\n\n\"There isn't a thing we don't know about each other,\" she had said.\n\"We each know the other's weaknesses and strength.  I hate the way you\ngnaw your mustache when you're troubled, and I think the fuss you make\nwhen the waiter pours your coffee without first having given you sugar\nand cream is the most absurd thing I've ever seen.  But, then, I know\nhow it annoys you to see me sitting with one slipper dangling from my\ntoe, when I'm particularly comfortable and snug.  You know how I like\nmy eggs, and you think it's immoral.  I suppose we're really set in our\nways.  It's going to be interesting to watch each other shift.\"\n\n\"Just the same,\" Buck said, \"I didn't dream there was any woman living\nwho could actually make a Pullman drawing-room look homelike.\"\n\n\"Any woman who has spent a fourth of her life in hotels and trains\nlearns that trick.  She has to.  If she happens to be the sort that\nlikes books and flowers and sewing, she carries some of each with her.\nAnd one book, one rose, and one piece of unfinished embroidery would\nmake an oasis in the Sahara Desert look homelike.\"\n\nIt was on the westbound train that they encountered Sam--Sam of the\nrolling eye, the genial grin, the deft hand.  Sam was known to every\nhardened traveler as the porter de luxe of the road. Sam was a\ndiplomat, a financier, and a rascal.  He never forgot a face.  He never\nforgave a meager tip.  The passengers who traveled with him were at\nonce his guests and his victims.\n\nTherefore his, \"Good evenin', Mis' McChesney, ma'am.  Good even'!\nWell, it suh't'nly has been a long time sense Ah had the pleasuh of yoh\npresence as passengah, ma'am.  Ah sure am----\"\n\nThe slim, elegant figure of T. A. Buck appeared in the doorway. Sam's\nrolling eye became a thing on ball bearings.  His teeth flashed\nstartlingly white in the broadest of grins.  He took Buck's hat, ran a\nfinger under its inner band, and shook it very gently.\n\n\"What's the idea?\" inquired Buck genially.  \"Are you a combination\nporter and prestidigitator?\"\n\nSam chuckled his infectious negro chuckle.\n\n\"Well, no, sah!  Ah wouldn' go's fah as t' say that, sah.  But Ah hab\nbeen known to shake rice out of a gen'lman's ordinary, ever'-day, black\nderby hat.\"\n\n\"Get out!\" laughed T. A. Buck, as Sam ducked.\n\n\"You may as well get used to it,\" smiled Emma, \"because I'm known to\nevery train-conductor, porter, hotel-clerk, chamber-maid, and bell-boy\nbetween here and the Great Lakes.\"\n\nIt was Sam who proved himself hero of the honeymoon, for he saved T. A.\nBuck from continuing his journey to Chicago brideless. Fifteen minutes\nearlier, Buck had gone to the buffet-car for a smoke.  At Cleveland,\nEmma, looking out of the car window, saw a familiar figure pacing up\nand down the station platform.  It was that dapper and important little\nIrishman, O'Malley, buyer for Gage & Fosdick, the greatest mail-order\nhouse in the world--O'Malley, whose letter T. A. Buck had answered;\nO'Malley, whose order meant thousands.  He was on his way to New York,\nof course.\n\nIn that moment Mrs. T. A. Buck faded into the background and Emma\nMcChesney rose up in her place.  She snatched hat and coat and furs,\nput them on as she went down the long aisle, swung down the car steps,\nand flew down the platform to the unconscious O'Malley.  He was\nsmoking, all unconscious.  The Fates had delivered him into her expert\nhands.  She knew those kindly sisters of old, and she was the last to\nrefuse their largesse.\n\n\"Mr. O'Malley!\"\n\nHe wheeled.\n\n\"Mrs. McChesney!\"  He had just a charming trace of a brogue. His\nenemies said he assumed it.  \"Well, who was I thinkin' of but you a\nminute ago.  What----\"\n\n\"I'm on my way to Chicago.  Saw you from the car window.  You're on the\nNew York train?  I thought so.  Tell me, you're surely seeing our man,\naren't you?\"\n\nO'Malley's smiling face clouded.  He was a temperamental Irishman--Ted\nO'Malley--with ideas on the deference due him and his great house.\n\n\"I'll tell you the truth, Mrs. McChesney.  I had a letter from your Mr.\nBuck.  It wasn't much of a letter to a man like me, representing a\nhouse like Gage & Fosdick.  It said both heads of the firm would be out\nof town, and would I see the manager. Me--see the manager!  Well,\nthinks I, if that's how important they think my order, then they'll not\nget it--that's all.  I've never yet----\"\n\n\"Dear Mr. O'Malley, please don't be offended.  As a McChesney to an\nO'Malley, I want to tell you that I've just been married.\"\n\n\"Married!  God bless me--to----\"\n\n\"To T. A. Buck, of course.  He's on that train.  He----\"\n\nShe turned toward the train.  And as she turned it began to move, ever\nso gently.  At the same moment there sped toward her, with unbelievable\nswiftness, the figure of Sam the porter, his eyes all whites.  By one\narm he grasped her, and half carried, half jerked her to the steps of\nthe moving train, swung her up to the steps like a bundle of rags,\ncaught the rail by a miracle, and stood, grinning and triumphant,\ngazing down at the panting O'Malley, who was running alongside the\ntrain.\n\n\"Back in a week.  Will you wait for us in New York?\" called Emma, her\nbreath coming fast.  She was trembling, too, and laughing.\n\n\"Will I wait!\" called back the puffing O'Malley, every bit of the Irish\nin him beaming from his eyes.  \"I'll be there when you get back as sure\nas your name's McBuck.\"\n\nFrom his pocket he took a round, silver Western dollar and, still\nrunning, tossed it to the toothy Sam.  That peerless porter caught it,\ntwirled it, kissed it, bowed, and grinned afresh as the train glided\nout of the shed.\n\nEmma, flushed, smiling, flew up the aisle.\n\nBuck, listening to her laughing, triumphant account of her hairbreadth,\nharum-scarum adventure, frowned before he smiled.\n\n\"Emma, how could you do it!  At least, why didn't you send back for me\nfirst?\"\n\nEmma smiled a little tremulously.\n\n\"Don't be angry.  You see, dear boy, I've only been your wife for a\nweek.  But I've been Featherloom petticoats for over fifteen years.\nIt's a habit.\"\n\nJust how strong and fixed a habit, she proved to herself a little more\nthan a week later.  It was the morning of their first breakfast in the\nnew apartment.  You would have thought, to see them over their coffee\nand eggs and rolls, that they had been breakfasting together thus for\nyears--Annie was so at home in her new kitchen; the deft little maid,\nin her crisp white, fitted so perfectly into the picture.  Perhaps the\nthing that T. A. Buck said, once the maid left them alone, might have\ngiven an outsider the cue.\n\n\"You remind me of a sweetpea, Emma.  One of those crisp, erect,\ngolden-white, fresh, fragrant sweetpeas.  I think it is the slenderest,\nsweetest, neatest, trimmest flower in the world, so delicately set on\nits stem, and yet so straight, so independent.\"\n\n\"T. A., you say such dear things to me!\"\n\nNo; they had not been breakfasting together for years.\n\n\"I'm glad you're not one of those women that wears a frowsy, lacy,\nribbony, what-do-you-call-'em-boudoir-cap--down to breakfast.  They\nalways make me think of uncombed hair.  That's just one reason why I'm\nglad.\"\n\n\"And I'm glad,\" said Emma, looking at his clear eyes and steady hand\nand firm skin, \"for a number of reasons.  One of them is that you're\nnot the sort of man who's a grouch at breakfast.\"\n\nWhen he had hat and coat and stick in hand, and had kissed her good-by\nand reached the door and opened it, he came back again, as is the way\nof bridegrooms.  But at last the door closed behind him.\n\nEmma sat there a moment, listening to his quick, light step down the\ncorridor, to the opening of the lift door, to its metallic closing.\nShe sat there, in the sunshiny dining-room, in her fresh, white morning\ngown.  She picked up her newspaper, opened it; scanned it, put it down.\nFor years, now, she had read her newspaper in little gulps on the way\ndowntown in crowded subway or street-car.  She could not accustom\nherself to this leisurely scanning of the pages.  She rose, went to the\nwindow, came back to the table, stood there a moment, her eyes fixed on\nsomething far away.\n\nThe swinging door between dining-room and butler's pantry opened.\nAnnie, in her neat blue-and-white stripes, stood before her.\n\n\"Shall it be steak or chops to-night, Mrs. Mc--Buck?\"\n\nEmma turned her head in Annie's direction--then her eyes.  The two\nactions were distinct and separate.\n\n\"Steak or----\"  There was a little bewildered look in her eyes.\n\nHer mind had not yet focused on the question.  \"Steak--oh!  Oh, yes, of\ncourse!  Why--why, Annie\"--and the splendid thousand-h.-p. mind brought\nitself down to the settling of this butter-churning, two-h.-p.\nquestion--\"why, Annie, considering all things, I think we'll make it\nfilet with mushrooms.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nBLUE SERGE\n\nFor ten years, Mrs. Emma McChesney's home had been a wardrobe-trunk.\nShe had taken her family life at second hand. Four nights out of the\nseven, her bed was \"Lower Eight,\" and her breakfast, as many mornings,\na cinder-strewn, lukewarm horror, taken tete-a-tete with a sleepy-eyed\nstranger and presided over by a white-coated, black-faced bandit, to\nwhom a coffee-slopped saucer was a matter of course.\n\nIt had been her habit during those ten years on the road as traveling\nsaleswoman for the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company, to avoid\nthe discomfort of the rapidly chilling car by slipping early into her\nberth.  There, in kimono, if not in comfort, she would shut down the\nelectric light with a snap, raise the shade, and, propped up on one\nelbow, watch the little towns go by.  They had a wonderful fascination\nfor her, those Middle Western towns, whose very names had a\ncomfortable, home-like sound--Sandusky, Galesburg, Crawfordsville,\nAppleton--very real towns, with very real people in them.  Peering\nwistfully out through the dusk, she could get little intimate glimpses\nof the home life of these people as the night came on.  In those modest\nframe houses near the station they need not trouble to pull down the\nshades as must their cautious city cousins.  As the train slowed down,\nthere could be had a glimpse of a matronly housewife moving deftly\nabout in the kitchen's warm-yellow glow, a man reading a paper in\nslippered, shirt-sleeved comfort, a pig-tailed girl at the piano, a\nwoman with a baby in her arms, or a family group, perhaps, seated about\nthe table, deep in an after-supper conclave.  It had made her homeless\nas she was homesick.\n\nEmma always liked that picture best.  Her keen, imaginative mind could\nsense the scene, could actually follow the trend of the talk during\nthis, the most genial, homely, soul-cheering hour of the day.  The\ntrifling events of the last twelve hours in schoolroom, in store, in\noffice, in street, in kitchen loom up large as they are rehearsed in\nthat magic, animated, cozy moment just before ma says, with a sigh:\n\n\"Well, folks, go on into the sitting-room.  Me and Nellie've got to\nclear away.\"\n\nJust silhouettes as the train flashed by--these small-town people--but\nvery human, very enviable to Emma McChesney.\n\n\"They're real,\" she would say.  \"They're regular, three-meals-a-day\npeople.  I've been peeking in at their windows for ten years, and I've\nlearned that it is in these towns that folks really live.  The\ndifference between life here and life in New York is the difference\nbetween area and depth.  D'you see what I mean?  In New York, they live\nby the mile, and here they live by the cubic foot.  Well, I'd rather\nhave one juicy, thick club-steak than a whole platterful of\nquarter-inch.  It's the same idea.\"\n\nTo those of her business colleagues whose habit it was to lounge in the\nhotel window with sneering comment upon the small-town procession as it\nwent by, Emma McChesney had been wont to say:\n\n\"Don't sneer at Main Street.  When you come to think of it, isn't it\ntrue that Fifth Avenue, any bright winter afternoon between four and\nsix, is only Main Street on a busy day multiplied by one thousand?\"\n\nEmma McChesney was not the sort of woman to rail at a fate that had\nplaced her in the harness instead of in the carriage.  But during all\nthe long years of up-hill pull, from the time she started with a humble\nsalary in the office of the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company,\nthrough the years spent on the road, up to the very time when the crown\nof success came to her in the form of the secretaryship of the\nprosperous firm of T. A. Buck, there was a minor but fixed ambition in\nher heart.  That same ambition is to be found deep down in the heart of\nevery woman whose morning costume is a tailor suit, whose newspaper\nmust be read in hurried snatches on the way downtown in crowded train\nor car, and to whom nine A.M. spells \"Business.\"\n\n\"In fifteen years,\" Emma McChesney used to say, \"I've never known what\nit is to loll in leisure.  I've never had a chance to luxuriate.\nSunday?  To a working woman, Sunday is for the purpose of repairing the\nravages of the other six days.  By the time you've washed your brushes,\nmended your skirt-braid, darned your stockings and gloves, looked for\ngray hairs and crows'-feet, and skimmed the magazine section, it's\nMonday.\"\n\nIt was small wonder that Emma McChesney's leisure had been limited.  In\nthose busy years she had not only earned the living for herself and her\nboy; she had trained that boy into manhood and placed his foot on the\nfirst rung of business success.  She had transformed the T. A. Buck\nFeatherloom Petticoat Company from a placidly mediocre concern to a\nthriving, flourishing, nationally known institution.  All this might\nhave turned another woman's head.  It only served to set Emma\nMcChesney's more splendidly on her shoulders.  Not too splendidly,\nhowever; for, with her marriage to her handsome business partner, T. A.\nBuck, that well-set, independent head was found to fit very cozily into\nthe comfortable hollow formed by T. A. Buck's right arm.\n\n\"Emma,\" Buck had said, just before their marriage, \"what is the\narrangement to be after--after----\"\n\n\"Just what it is now, I suppose,\" Emma had replied, \"except that we'll\ncome down to the office together.\"\n\nHe had regarded her thoughtfully for a long minute.  Then, \"Emma, for\nthree months after our marriage will you try being just Mrs. T. A.\nBuck?\"\n\n\"You mean no factory, no Featherlooms, no dictation, no business\nbothers!\"  Her voice was a rising scale of surprise.\n\n\"Just try it for three months, with the privilege of a lifetime, if you\nlike it.  But try it.  I--I'd like to see you there when I leave, Emma.\nI'd like to have you there when I come home.  I suppose I sound like a\nselfish Turk, but----\"\n\n\"You sound like a regular husband,\" Emma McChesney had interrupted,\n\"and I love you for it.  Now listen, T. A.  For three whole months I'm\ngoing to be what the yellow novels used to call a doll-wife.  I'm going\nto meet you at the door every night with a rose in my hair.  I shall\nwear pink things with lace ruffles on 'em.  Don't you know that I've\nbeen longing to do just those things for years and years?  I'm going to\nblossom out into a beauty.  Watch me!  I've never had time to study\nmyself.  I'll hold shades of yellow and green and flesh-color up to my\nface to see which brings out the right tints.  I'm going to gaze at\nmyself through half-closed eyes to see which shade produces tawny\nlights in my hair.  Ever since I can remember, I've been so busy that\nit has been a question of getting the best possible garments in the\nleast possible time for the smallest possible sum.  In that case, one\ngets blue serge.  I've worn blue serge until it feels like a convict's\nuniform.  I'm going to blossom out into fawn and green and mauve.  I\nshall get evening dresses with only bead shoulder-straps.  I'm going to\nshop.  I've never really seen Fifth Avenue between eleven and one, when\nthe real people come out.  My views of it have been at nine A.M. when\nthe office-workers are going to work, and at five-thirty when they are\ngoing home.  I will now cease to observe the proletariat and mingle\nwith the predatory.  I'll probably go in for those tiffin things at the\nPlaza.  If I do, I'll never be the same woman again.\"\n\nWhereupon she paused with dramatic effect.\n\nTo all of which T. A. Buck had replied:\n\n\"Go as far as you like.  Take fencing lessons, if you want to, or\nSanskrit.  You've been a queen bee for so many years that I think the\nrole of drone will be a pleasant change.  Let me shoulder the business\nworries for a while.  You've borne them long enough.\"\n\n\"It's a bargain.  For three months I shall do nothing more militant\nthan to pick imaginary threads off your coat lapel and pout when you\nmention business.  At the end of those three months we'll go into\nprivate session, compare notes, and determine whether the plan shall\ncease or become permanent.  Shake hands on it.\"\n\nThey shook hands solemnly.  As they did so, a faint shadow of doubt\nhovered far, far back in the depths of T. A. Buck's fine eyes.  And a\nfaint, inscrutable smile lurked in the corners of Emma's lips.\n\nSo it was that Emma McChesney, the alert, the capable, the brisk, the\nbusiness-like, assumed the role of Mrs. T. A. Buck, the leisurely, the\nlanguid, the elegant.  She, who formerly, at eleven in the morning,\nmight have been seen bent on selling the best possible bill of spring\nFeatherlooms to Joe Greenbaum, of Keokuk, Iowa, could now be found in a\nmodiste's gray-and-raspberry salon, being draped and pinned and fitted.\nShe, whose dynamic force once charged the entire office and factory\nwith energy and efficiency, now distributed a tithe of that priceless\nvigor here, a tithe there, a tithe everywhere, and thus broke the very\nbackbone of its power.\n\nShe had never been a woman to do things by halves.  What she undertook\nto do she did thoroughly and whole-heartedly.  This principle she\napplied to her new mode of life as rigidly as she had to the old.\n\nThat first month slipped magically by.  Emma was too much a woman not\nto feel a certain exquisite pleasure in the selecting of delicate and\nbecoming fabrics.  There was a thrill of novelty in being able to spend\nan hour curled up with a book after lunch, to listen to music one\nafternoon a week, to drive through the mistily gray park; to walk up\nthe thronged, sparkling Avenue, pausing before its Aladdin's Cave\nwindows.  Simple enough pleasures, and taken quite as a matter of\ncourse by thousands of other women who had no work-filled life behind\nthem to use as contrast.\n\nShe plunged into her new life whole-heartedly.  The first new gown was\nexciting.  It was a velvet affair with furs, and gratifyingly becoming.\nHer shining blond head rose above the soft background of velvet and fur\nwith an effect to distract the least observing.\n\n\"Like it?\" she had asked Buck, turning slowly, frankly sure of herself.\n\n\"You're wonderful in it,\" said T. A. Buck.  \"Say, Emma, where's that\nblue thing you used to wear--the one with the white cuffs and collar,\nand the little blue hat with the what-cha-ma-call-ems on it?\"\n\n\"T. A. Buck, you're--you're--well, you're a man, that's what you are!\nThat blue thing was worn threadbare in the office, and I gave it to the\nlaundress's niece weeks ago.\"  Small wonder her cheeks took on a deeper\npink.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Buck, unruffled, \"too bad!  There was something about that\ndress--I don't know----\"\n\nAt the first sitting of the second gown, Emma revolted openly.\n\nOn the floor at Emma's feet there was knotted into a contortionistic\nattitude a small, wiry, impolite person named Smalley.  Miss Smalley\nwas an artist in draping and knew it.  She was the least fashionable\nperson in all that smart dressmaking establishment.  She refused to\nnotice the corset-coiffure-and-charmeuse edict that governed all other\nemployees in the shop.  In her shabby little dress, her steel-rimmed\nspectacles, her black-sateen apron, Smalley might have passed for a\nBird Center home dressmaker.  Yet, given a yard or two or three of\nsatin and a saucer of pins, Smalley could make the dumpiest of\ndebutantes look like a fragile flower.\n\nAt a critical moment Emma stirred.  Handicapped as she was by a\nmouthful of nineteen pins and her bow-knot attitude, Smalley still\ncould voice a protest.\n\n\"Don't move!\" she commanded, thickly.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" Emma said, and moved again, more disastrously than\nbefore.  \"Don't you think it's too--too young?\"\n\nShe eyed herself in the mirror anxiously, then looked down at Miss\nSmalley's nut-cracker face that was peering up at her, its lips pursed\ngrotesquely over the pins.\n\n\"Of course it is,\" mumbled Miss Smalley.  \"Everybody's clothes are too\nyoung for 'em nowadays.  The only difference between the dresses we\nmake for girls of sixteen and the dresses we make for their\ngrandmothers of sixty is that the sixty-year-old ones want 'em shorter\nand lower, and they run more to rose-bud trimming.\"\n\nEmma surveyed the acid Miss Smalley with a look that was half amused,\nhalf vexed, wholly determined.\n\n\"I shan't wear it.  Heaven knows I'm not sixty, but I'm not sixteen\neither!  I don't want to be.\"\n\nMiss Smalley, doubling again to her task, flung upward a grudging\ncompliment.\n\n\"Well, anyway, you've got the hair and the coloring and the figure for\nit.  Goodness knows you look young enough!\"\n\n\"That's because I've worked hard all my life,\" retorted Emma, almost\nviciously.  \"Another month of this leisure and I'll be as wrinkled as\nthe rest of them.\"\n\nSmalley's magic fingers paused in their manipulation of a soft fold of\nsatin.\n\n\"Worked?  Earned a living?  Used your wits and brains every day against\nthe wits and brains of other folks?\"\n\n\"Every day.\"\n\nInto the eyes of Miss Smalley, the artist in draping, there crept the\nshrewd twinkle of Miss Smalley, the successful woman in business.  She\nhad been sitting back on her knees, surveying her handiwork through\nnarrowed lids.  Now she turned her gaze on Emma, who was smiling down\nat her.\n\n\"Then for goodness' sake don't stop!  I've found out that work is a\nkind of self-oiler.  If you're used to it, the minute you stop you\nbegin to get rusty, and your hinges creak and you clog up.  And the\nnext thing you know, you break down.  Work that you like to do is a\nblessing.  It keeps you young.  When my mother was my age, she was\ncrippled with rheumatism, and all gnarled up, and quavery, and all she\nhad to look forward to was death.  Now me--every time the styles in\nskirts change I get a new hold on life.  And on a day when I can make a\nshort, fat woman look like a tall, thin woman, just by sitting here on\nmy knees with a handful of pins, and giving her the line she needs, I\ngo home feeling like I'd just been born.\"\n\n\"I know that feeling,\" said Emma, in her eyes a sparkle that had long\nbeen absent.  \"I've had it when I've landed a thousand-dollar\nFeatherloom order from a man who has assured me that he isn't\ninterested in our line.\"\n\nAt dinner that evening, Emma's gown was so obviously not of the new\ncrop that even her husband's inexpert eye noted it.\n\n\"That's not one of the new ones, is it?\"\n\n\"This!  And you a manufacturer of skirts!\"\n\n\"What's the matter with the supply of new dresses?  Isn't there enough\nto go round?\"\n\n\"Enough!  I've never had so many new gowns in my life.  The trouble is\nthat I shan't feel at home in them until I've had 'em all dry-cleaned\nat least once.\"\n\nDuring the second month, there came a sudden, sharp change in skirt\nmodes.  For four years women had been mincing along in garments so\nabsurdly narrow that each step was a thing to be considered, each\ncurbing or car-step demanding careful negotiation.  Now, Fashion, in\nher freakiest mood, commanded a bewildering width of skirt that was\njust one remove from the flaring hoops of Civil War days.  Emma knew\nwhat that meant for the Featherloom workrooms and selling staff.  New\ndesigns, new models, a shift in prices, a boom for petticoats, for four\nyears a garment despised.\n\nA hundred questions were on the tip of Emma's tongue; a hundred\nsuggestions flashed into her keen mind; there occurred to her a\nwonderful design for a new model which should be full and flaring\nwithout being bulky and uncomfortable as were the wide petticoats of\nthe old days.\n\nBut a bargain was a bargain.  Still, Emma Buck was as human as Emma\nMcChesney had been.  She could not resist a timid,\n\n\"T. A., are you--that is--I was just wondering--you're making 'em wide,\nI suppose, for the spring trade.\"\n\nA queer look flashed into T. A. Buck's eyes--a relieved look that was\nas quickly replaced by an expression both baffled and anxious.\n\n\"Why--a--mmmm--yes--oh, yes, we're making 'em up wide, but----\"\n\n\"But what?\" Emma leaned forward, tense.\n\n\"Oh, nothing--nothing.\"\n\nDuring the second month there came calling on Emma, those solid and\nheavy New Yorkers, with whom the Buck family had been on friendly terms\nfor many years.  They came at the correct hour, in their correct motor\nor conservative broughams, wearing their quietly correct clothes, and\nEmma gave them tea, and they talked on every subject from suffrage to\nsalad dressings, and from war to weather, but never once was mention\nmade of business.  And Emma McChesney's life had been interwoven with\nbusiness for more than fifteen years.\n\nThere were dinners--long, heavy, correct dinners.  Emma, very well\ndressed, bright-eyed, alert, intelligent, vital, became very popular at\nthese affairs, and her husband very proud of her popularity.  And if\nany one as thoroughly alive as Mrs. T. A. Buck could have been bored to\nextinction by anything, then those dinners would have accomplished the\ndeadly work.\n\n\"T. A.,\" she said one evening, after a particularly large affair of\nthis sort, \"T. A., have you ever noticed anything about me that is\ndifferent from other women?\"\n\n\"Have I?  Well, I should say I----\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't mean what you mean, dear--thanks just the same.  I mean\nthose women tonight.  They all seem to 'go in' for something--votes or\ncharity or dancing or social service, or something--even the girls.\nAnd they all sounded so amateurish, so untrained, so unprepared, yet\nthey seemed to be dreadfully in earnest.\"\n\n\"This is the difference,\" said T. A. Buck.  \"You've rubbed up against\nlife, and you know.  They've always been sheltered, but now they want\nto know.  Well, naturally they're going to bungle and bump their heads\na good many times before they really find out.\"\n\n\"Anyway,\" retorted Emma, \"they want to know.  That's something.  It's\nbetter to have bumped your head, even though you never see what's on\nthe other side of the wall, than never to have tried to climb it.\"\n\nIt was in the third week of the third month that Emma encountered\nHortense.  Hortense, before her marriage to Henry, the shipping-clerk,\nhad been a very pretty, very pert, very devoted little stenographer in\nthe office of the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company.  She had\nmarried just a month after her employers, and Emma, from the fulness of\nher own brimming cup of happiness, had made Hortense happy with a gift\nof linens and lingerie and lace of a fineness that Hortense's\nbeauty-loving, feminine heart could never have hoped for.\n\nThey met in the busy aisle of a downtown department store and shook\nhands as do those who have a common bond.\n\nHortense, as pretty as ever and as pert, spoke first.\n\n\"I wouldn't have known you, Mrs. Mc-- Buck!\"\n\n\"No?  Why not?\"\n\n\"You look--no one would think you'd ever worked in your life.  I was\ndown at the office the other day for a minute--the first time since I\nwas married.  They told me you weren't there any more.\"\n\n\"No; I haven't been down since my marriage either.  I'm like you--an\nelegant lady of leisure.\"\n\nHortense's bright-blue eyes dwelt searchingly on the face of her former\nemployer.\n\n\"The bunch in the office said they missed you something awful.\" Then,\nin haste:  \"Oh, I don't mean that Mr. Buck don't make things go all\nright.  They're awful fond of him.  But--I don't know--Miss Kelly said\nshe never has got over waiting for the sound of your step down the hall\nat nine--sort of light and quick and sharp and busy, as if you couldn't\nwait till you waded into the day's work.  Do you know what I mean?\"\n\n\"I know what you mean,\" said Emma.\n\nThere was a little pause.  The two women so far apart, yet so near; so\ndifferent, yet so like, gazed far down into each other's soul.\n\n\"Miss it, don't you?\" said Hortense.\n\n\"Yes; don't you?\"\n\n\"Do I!  Say----\"  She turned and indicated the women surging up and\ndown the store aisles, and her glance and gesture were replete with\ncontempt.  \"Say; look at 'em!  Wandering around here, aimless as a lot\nof chickens in a barnyard.  Half of 'em are here because they haven't\ngot anything else to do.  Think of it!  I've watched 'em lots of times.\nThey go pawing over silks and laces and trimmings just for the pleasure\nof feeling 'em. They stand in front of a glass case with a figure in it\nall dressed up in satin and furs and jewels, and you'd think they were\nworshiping an idol like they used to in the olden days. They don't seem\nto have anything to do.  Nothing to occupy their--their heads.  Say, if\nI thought I was going to be like them in time, I----\"\n\n\"Hortense, my dear child, you're--you're happy, aren't you? Henry----\"\n\n\"Well, I should say we are!  I'm crazy about Henry, and he thinks I'm\nperfect.  Honestly, ain't they a scream!  They think they're so big and\nmanly and all, and they're just like kids; ain't it so?  We're living\nin a four-room apartment in Harlem. We've got it fixed up too cozy for\nanything.\"\n\n\"I'd like to come and see you,\" said Emma.  Hortense opened her eyes\nwide.\n\n\"Honestly; if you would----\"\n\n\"Let's go up now.  I've the car outside.\"\n\n\"Now!  Why I--I'd love it!\"\n\nThey chattered like schoolgirls on the way uptown--these two who had\nfound so much in common.  The little apartment reached, Hortense threw\nopen the door with the confident gesture of the housekeeper who is not\nafraid to have her household taken by surprise--whose housekeeping is\nan index of character.\n\nHortense had been a clean-cut little stenographer.  Her correspondence\nhad always been free from erasures, thumb-marks, errors.  Her four-room\nflat was as spotless as her typewritten letters had been.  The kitchen\nshone in its blue and white and nickel.  A canary chirped in the tiny\ndining-room.  There were books and magazines on the sitting-room table.\nThe bedroom was brave in its snowy spread and the toilet silver that\nhad been Henry's gift to her the Christmas they became engaged.\n\nEmma examined everything, exclaimed over everything, admired\neverything.  Hortense glowed like a rose.\n\n\"Do you really like it?  I like the green velours in the sitting-room,\ndon't you?  It's always so kind and cheerful. We're not all settled\nyet.  I don't suppose we ever will be. Sundays, Henry putters around,\nputting up shelves, and fooling around with a can of paint.  I always\ntell him he ought to have lived on a farm, where he'd have elbow-room.\"\n\n\"No wonder you're so happy and busy,\" Emma exclaimed, and patted the\ngirl's fresh, young cheek.\n\nHortense was silent a moment.\n\n\"I'm happy,\" she said, at last, \"but I ain't busy.  And--well, if\nyou're not busy, you can't be happy very long, can you?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Emma, \"idleness, when you're not used to it, is misery.\"\n\n\"There!  You've said it!  It's like running on half-time when you're\nused to a day-and-night shift.  Something's lacking.  It isn't that\nHenry isn't grand to me, because he is.  Evenings, we're so happy that\nwe just sit and grin at each other and half the time we forget to go to\na 'movie.' After Henry leaves in the morning, I get to work.  I\nsuppose, in the old days, when women used to have to chop the kindling,\nand catch the water for washing in a rain-barrel, and keep up a fire in\nthe kitchen stove and do their own bread baking and all, it used to\nkeep 'em hustling.  But, my goodness!  A four-room flat for two isn't\nany work.  By eleven, I'm through.  I've straightened everything, from\nthe bed to the refrigerator; the marketing's done, and the dinner\nvegetables are sitting around in cold water.  The mending for two is a\njoke.  Henry says it's a wonder I don't sew double-breasted buttons on\nhis undershirts.\"\n\nEmma was not smiling.  But, then, neither was Hortense.  She was\ntalking lightly, seemingly, but her pretty face was quite serious.\n\n\"The big noise in my day is when Henry comes home at six.  That was all\nright and natural, I suppose, in those times when a quilting-bee was a\nwild afternoon's work, and teaching school was the most advanced job a\nwoman could hold down.\"\n\nEmma was gazing fascinated at the girl's sparkling face.  Her own eyes\nwere very bright, and her lips were parted.\n\n\"Tell me, Hortense,\" she said now; \"what does Henry say to all this?\nHave you told him how you feel?\"\n\n\"Well, I--I talked to him about it once or twice.  I told him that I've\ngot about twenty-four solid hours a week that I might be getting fifty\ncents an hour for.  You know, I worked for a manuscript-typewriting\nconcern before I came over to Buck's--plays and stories and that kind\nof thing.  They used to like my work because I never queered their\nspeeches by leaving out punctuation or mixing up the characters.  The\nmanager there said I could have work any time I wanted it.  I've got my\nown typewriter.  I got it second hand when I first started in.  Henry\npicks around on it sometimes, evenings.  I hardly ever touch it. It's\ngetting rusty--and so am I.\"\n\n\"It isn't just the money you want, Hortense?  Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Of course I'd like the money.  That extra coming in would mean\nbooks--I'm crazy about reading, and so is Henry--and theaters and lots\nof things we can't afford now.  But that isn't all.  Henry don't want\nto be a shipping-clerk all his life.  He's crazy about mechanics and\nthat kind of stuff.  But the books that he needs cost a lot.  Don't you\nsuppose I'd be proud to feel that the extra money I'd earned would lift\nhim up where he could have a chance to be something!  But Henry is dead\nset against it.  He says he is the one that's going to earn the money\naround here.  I try to tell him that I'm used to using my mind.  He\nlaughs and pinches my cheek and tells me to use it thinking about him.\"\nShe stopped suddenly and regarded Emma with conscience-stricken eyes.\n\"You don't think I'm running down Henry, do you?  My goodness, I don't\nwant you to think that I'd change back again for a million dollars,\nbecause I wouldn't.\"  She looked up at Emma, conscience-stricken.\n\nEmma came swiftly over and put one hand on the girl's shoulder.\n\n\"I don't think it.  Not for a minute.  I know that the world is full of\nHenrys, and that the number of Hortenses is growing larger and larger.\nI don't know if the four-room flats are to blame, or whether it's just\na natural development.  But the Henry-Hortense situation seems to be\nspreading to the nine-room-and-three-baths apartments, too.\"\n\nHortense nodded a knowing head.\n\n\"I kind of thought so, from the way you were listening.\"\n\nThe two, standing there gazing at each other almost shyly, suddenly\nbegan to laugh.  The laugh was a safety-valve.  Then, quite as\nsuddenly, both became serious.  That seriousness had been the\nunder-current throughout.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Emma very gently, \"if a small Henry, some day, won't\nprovide you with an outlet for all that stored-up energy.\"\n\nHortense looked up very bravely.\n\n\"Maybe.  You--you must have been about my age when your boy was born.\nDid he make you feel--different?\"\n\nThe shade of sadness that always came at the mention of those unhappy\nyears of her early marriage crept into Emma's face now.\n\n\"That was not the same, dear,\" she explained.  \"I hadn't your sort of\nHenry.  You see, my boy was my only excuse for living. You'll never\nknow what that means.  And when things grew altogether impossible, and\nI knew that I must earn a living for Jock and myself, I just did\nit--that's all.  I had to.\"\n\nHortense thought that over for one deliberate moment.  Her brows were\ndrawn in a frown.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I think,\" she announced, at last, \"though I don't\nknow that I can just exactly put it into words.  I mean this:  Some\npeople are just bound to--to give, to build up things, to--well, to\nmanufacture, because they just can't help it.  It's in 'em, and it's\ngot to come out.  Dynamos--that's what Henry's technical books would\ncall them.  You're one--a great big one.  I'm one.  Just a little tiny\none.  But it's sparking away there all the time, and it might as well\nbe put to some use, mightn't it?\"\n\nEmma bent down and kissed the troubled forehead, and then, very\ntenderly, the pretty, puckered lips.\n\n\"Little Hortense,\" she said, \"you're asking a great big question.  I\ncan answer it for myself, but I can't answer it for you.  It's too\ndangerous.  I wouldn't if I could.\"\n\nEmma, waiting in the hall for the lift, looked back at the slim little\nfigure in the doorway.  There was a droop to the shoulders.  Emma's\nheart smote her.\n\n\"Don't bother your head about all this, little girl,\" she called back\nto her.  \"Just forget to be ambitious and remember to be happy.  That's\nmuch the better way.\"\n\nHortense, from the doorway, grinned a rather wicked little grin.\n\n\"When are you going back to the office, Mrs. Buck?\" she asked, quietly\nenough.\n\n\"What makes you think I'm going back at all?\" demanded Emma, stepping\ninto the shaky little elevator.\n\n\"I don't think it,\" retorted Hortense, once more the pert.  \"I know it.\"\n\nEmma knew it, too.  She had known it from the moment that she shook\nhands in her compact.  There was still one week remaining of the\nstipulated three months.  It seemed to Emma that that one week was\nlonger than the combined eleven.  But she went through with colors\nflying.  Whatever Emma McChesney Buck did, she did well.  But, then, T.\nA. Buck had done his part well, too--so well that, on the final day,\nEmma felt a sinking at her heart.  He seemed so satisfied with affairs\nas they were.  He was, apparently, so content to drop all thought of\nbusiness when he left the office for his home.\n\n\nEmma had planned a very special little dinner that evening.  She wore a\nvery special gown, too--one of the new ones.  T. A. noticed it at once,\nand the dinner as well, being that kind of husband.  Still, Annie, the\ncook, complained later, to the parlor-maid, about the thanklessness of\ncooking dinners for folks who didn't eat more'n a mouthful, anyway.\n\nDinner over,\n\n\"Well, Emma?\" said T. A. Buck.\n\n\"Light your cigar, T. A.,\" said Emma.  \"You'll need it.\"\n\nT. A. lighted it with admirable leisureliness, sent out a great puff of\nfragrant smoke, and surveyed his wife through half-closed lids.\nBeneath his air of ease there was a tension.\n\n\"Well, Emma?\" he said again, gently.\n\nEmma looked at him a moment appreciatively.  She had too much poise and\nbalance and control herself not to recognize and admire those qualities\nin others.\n\n\"T. A., if I had been what they call a homebody, we wouldn't be married\nto-day, would we?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You knew plenty of home-women that you could have married, didn't you?\"\n\n\"I didn't ask them, Emma, but----\"\n\n\"You know what I mean.  Now listen, T. A.:  I've loafed for three\nmonths.  I've lolled and lazied and languished.  And I've never been so\ntired in my life--not even when we were taking January inventory.\nAnother month of this, and I'd be an old, old woman.  I understand,\nnow, what it is that brings that hard, tired, stony look into the faces\nof the idle women.  They have to work so hard to try to keep happy.  I\nsuppose if I had been a homebody all my life, I might be hardened to\nthis kind of thing.  But it's too late now.  And I'm thankful for it.\nThose women who want to shop and dress and drive and play are welcome\nto my share of it.  If I am to be punished in the next world for my\nwickedness in this, I know what form my torture will take.  I shall\nhave to go from shop to shop with a piece of lace in my hand, matching\na sample of insertion.  Fifteen years of being in the thick of it spoil\none for tatting and tea.  The world is full of homebodies, I suppose.\nAnd they're happy. I suppose I might have been one, too, if I hadn't\nbeen obliged to get out and hustle.  But it's too late to learn now.\nBesides, I don't want to.  If I do try, I'll be destroying the very\nthing that attracted you to me in the first place.  Remember what you\nsaid about the Fifth Avenue girl?\"\n\n\"But, Emma,\" interrupted Buck very quietly, \"I don't want you to try.\"\n\nEmma, with a rush of words at her very lips, paused, eyed him for a\ndoubtful moment, asked a faltering question.\n\n\"But it was your plan--you said you wanted me to be here when you came\nhome and when you left, didn't you?  Do you mean you----\"\n\n\"I mean that I've missed my business partner every minute for three\nmonths.  All the time we've been going to those fool dinners and all\nthat kind of thing, I've been bursting to talk skirts to you.  I--say,\nEmma, Adler's designed a new model--a full one, of course, but there's\nsomething wrong with it.  I can't put my finger on the flaw, but----\"\n\nEmma came swiftly over to his chair.\n\n\"Make a sketch of it, can't you?\" she said.  From his pocket Buck drew\na pencil, an envelope, and fell to sketching rapidly, squinting down\nthrough his cigar smoke as he worked.\n\n\"It's like this,\" he began, absorbed and happy; \"you see, where the\nfulness begins at the knee----\"\n\n\"Yes!\" prompted Emma, breathlessly.\n\nTwo hours later they were still bent over the much marked bit of paper.\nBut their interest in it was not that of those who would solve a\nperplexing problem.  It was the lingering, satisfied contemplation of a\ntask accomplished.\n\nEmma straightened, leaned back, sighed--a victorious, happy sigh.\n\n\"And to think,\" she said, marveling, \"to think that I once envied the\nwomen who had nothing to do but the things I've done in the last three\nmonths!\"\n\nBuck had risen, stretched luxuriously, yawned.  Now he came over to his\nwife and took her head in his two hands, cozily, and stood a moment\nlooking into her shining eyes.\n\n\"Emma, I may have mentioned this once or twice before, but perhaps\nyou'll still be interested to know that I think you're a wonder.  A\nwonder!  You're the----\"\n\n\"Oh, well, we won't quarrel about that,\" smiled Emma brazenly. \"But I\nwonder if Adler will agree with us when he sees what we've done to his\nnewest skirt design.\"\n\nSuddenly a new thought seemed to strike her.  She was off down the\nhall.  Buck, following in a leisurely manner, hands in pockets, stood\nin the bedroom door and watched her plunge into the innermost depths of\nthe clothes-closet.\n\n\"What's the idea, Emma?\"\n\n\"Looking for something,\" came back his wife's muffled tones.\n\nA long wait.\n\n\"Can I help?\"\n\n\"I've got it!\" cried Emma, and emerged triumphant, flushed, smiling,\nholding a garment at arm's length, aloft.\n\n\"What----\"\n\nEmma shook it smartly, turned it this way and that, held it up under\nher chin by the sleeves.\n\n\"Why, girl!\" exclaimed Buck, all a-grin, \"it's the----\"\n\n\"The blue serge,\" Emma finished for him, \"with the white collars and\ncuffs.  And what's more, young man, it's the little blue hat with the\nwhat-cha-ma-call-ems on it.  And praise be! I'm wearing 'em both\ndown-town to-morrow morning.\"\n\n\n\nV\n\n\"HOOPS, MY DEAR!\"\n\nEmma McChesney Buck always vigorously disclaimed any knowledge of that\ndreamy-eyed damsel known as Inspiration.  T. A. Buck, her\nhusband-partner, accused her of being on intimate terms with the lady.\nSo did the adoring office staff of the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat\nCompany.  Out in the workshop itself, the designers and cutters, those\njealous artists of the pencil, shears, and yardstick, looked on in awed\nadmiration on those rare occasions when the feminine member of the\nbusiness took the scissors in her firm white hands and slashed boldly\ninto a shimmering length of petticoat-silk.  When she put down the\ngreat shears, there lay on the table the detached parts of that which\nthe appreciative and experienced eyes of the craftsmen knew to be a new\nand original variation of that elastic garment known as the underskirt.\n\nFor weeks preceding one of these cutting-exhibitions, Emma was likely\nto be not quite her usual brisk self.  A mystic glow replaced the alert\nbrightness of her eye.  Her wide-awake manner gave way to one of almost\nsluggish inactivity.\n\nThe outer office, noting these things, would lift its eyebrows\nsignificantly.\n\n\"Another hunch!\" it would whisper.  \"The last time she beat the rest of\nthe trade by six weeks with that elastic-top gusset.\"\n\n\"Inspiration working, Emma?\" T. A. Buck would ask, noting the symptoms.\n\n\"It isn't inspiration, T. A. Nothing of the kind!  It's just an attack\nof imagination, complicated by clothes-instinct.\"\n\n\"That's all that ails Poiret,\" Buck would retort.\n\nEarly in the autumn, when women were still walking with an absurd\nsidewise gait, like a duck, or a filly that is too tightly hobbled, the\njunior partner of the firm began to show unmistakable signs of business\naberration.  A blight seemed to have fallen upon her bright little\noffice, usually humming with activity.  The machinery of her day,\nordinarily as noiseless and well ordered as a thing on ball bearings,\nnow rasped, creaked, jerked, stood still, jolted on again.  A bustling\nclerk or stenographer, entering with paper or memorandum, would find\nher bent over her desk, pencil in hand, absorbed in a rough drawing\nthat seemed to bear no relation to the skirt of the day.  The margin of\nher morning paper was filled with queer little scrawls by the time she\nreached the office.  She drew weird lines with her fork on the\ntable-cloth at lunch.  These hieroglyphics she covered with a quick\nhand, like a bashful schoolgirl, when any one peeped.\n\n\"Tell a fellow what it's going to be, can't you?\" pleaded Buck.\n\n\"I got one glimpse yesterday, when you didn't know I was looking over\nyour shoulder.  It seemed a pass between an overgrown Zeppelin and an\napple dumpling.  So I know it can't be a skirt. Come on, Emma; tell\nyour old man!\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" Emma would reply dreamily.\n\nBuck would strike an attitude intended to intimidate.\n\n\"If you have no sense of what is due me as your husband, then I demand,\nas senior partner of this firm, to know what it is that is taking your\ntime, which rightfully belongs to this business.\"\n\n\"Go away, T. A., and stop pestering me!  What do you think I'm\ndesigning--a doily?\"\n\nBuck, turning to go to his own office, threw a last retort over his\nshoulder--a rather sobering one, this time.\n\n\"Whatever it is, it had better be good--with business what it is and\nskirts what they are.\"\n\nEmma lifted her head to reply to that.\n\n\"It isn't what they are that interests me.  It's what they're going to\nbe.\"\n\nBuck paused in the doorway.\n\n\"Going to be!  Anybody can see that.  Underneath that full, fool,\nflaring over-drape, the real skirt is as tight as ever.  I don't think\nthe spring models will show an inch of real difference.  I tell you,\nEmma, it's serious.\"\n\nEmma, apparently absorbed in her work, did not reply to this. But a\nvague something about the back of her head told T. A. Buck that she was\nlaughing at him.  The knowledge only gave him new confidence in this\nresourceful, many-sided, lovable, level-headed partner-wife of his.\n\nTwo weeks went by--four--six--eight.  Emma began to look a little thin.\nHer bright color was there only when she was overtired or excited.  The\nworkrooms began to talk of new designs for spring, though it was\nscarcely mid-winter.  The head designer came forward timidly with a\nskirt that measured a yard around the bottom.  Emma looked at it, tried\nto keep her lower lip prisoner between her teeth, failed, and began to\nlaugh helplessly, almost hysterically.\n\nAmazement in the faces of Buck and Koritz, the designer, became\nconsternation, then, in the designer, resentment.\n\nKoritz, dark, undersized, with the eyes of an Oriental and the lean,\nsensitive fingers of one who creates, shivered a little, like a plant\nthat is swept by an icy blast.  Buck came over and laid one hand on his\nwife's shaking shoulder.\n\n\"Emma, you're overtired!  This--this thing you've been slaving over has\nbeen too much for you.\"\n\nWith one hand, Emma reached up and patted the fingers that rested\nprotectingly on her shoulder.  With the other, she wiped her eyes,\nthen, all contrition, grasped the slender brown hand of the offended\nKoritz.\n\n\"Bennie, please forgive me!  I--I didn't mean to laugh.  I wasn't\nlaughing at your new skirt.\"\n\n\"You think it's too wide, maybe, huh?\" Bennie Koritz said, and held it\nup doubtfully.\n\n\"Too wide!\"  For a moment Emma seemed threatened with another attack of\nthat inexplicable laughter.  She choked it back resolutely.\n\n\"No, Bennie; not too wide.  I'll tell you to-morrow why I laughed.\nThen, perhaps, you'll laugh with me.\"\n\nBennie, draping his despised skirt-model over one arm, had the courage\nto smile even now, though grimly.\n\n\"I laugh--sure,\" he said, showing his white teeth now.  \"But the laugh\nwill be, I bet you, on me--like it was when you designed that\nknickerbocker before the trade knew such a thing could be.\"\n\nImpulsively Emma grasped his hand and shook it, as though she found a\ncertain needed encouragement in the loyalty of this sallow little\nRussian.\n\n\"Bennie, you're a true artist--because you're big enough to praise the\nwork of a fellow craftsman when you recognize its value.\"  And Koritz,\nthe dull red showing under the olive of his cheeks, went back to his\ncutting-table happy.\n\nBuck bent forward, eagerly.\n\n\"You're going to tell me now, Emma?  It's finished?\"\n\n\"To-night--at home.  I want to be the first to try it on.  I'll play\nmodel.  A private exhibition, just for you.  It's not only finished; it\nis patented.\"\n\n\"Patented!  But why?  What is it, anyway?  A new fastener?  I thought\nit was a skirt.\"\n\n\"Wait until you see it.  You'll think I should have had it copyrighted\nas well, not to say passed by the national board of censors.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that I'm to be the entire audience at the premiere\nof this new model?\"\n\n\"You are to be audience, critic, orchestra, box-holder, patron, and\n'Diamond Jim' Brady.  Now run along into your own office--won't you,\ndear?  I want to get out these letters.\"  And she pressed the button\nthat summoned a stenographer.\n\nT. A. Buck, resigned, admiring, and anticipatory, went.\n\nAnnie, the cook, was justified that evening in her bitter complaint.\nHer excellent dinner received scant enough attention from these two.\nThey hurried through it like eager, bright-eyed school-children who\nhave been promised a treat.  Two scarlet spots glowed in Emma's cheeks.\nBuck's eyes, through the haze of his after-dinner cigar, were luminous.\n\n\"Now?\"\n\n\"No; not yet.  I want you to smoke your cigar and digest your dinner\nand read your paper.  I want you to twiddle your thumbs a little and\nlook at your watch.  First-night curtains are always late in rising,\naren't they?  Well!\"\n\nShe turned on the full glare of the chandelier, turned it off, went\nabout flicking on the soft-shaded wall lights and the lamps.\n\n\"Turn your chair so that your back will be toward the door.\"\n\nHe turned it obediently.\n\nEmma vanished.\n\nFrom the direction of her bedroom there presently came the sounds of\ndresser drawers hurriedly opened and shut with a bang, of a slipper\ndropped on the hard-wood floor, a tune hummed in an absent-minded\nabsorption under the breath, an excited little laugh nervously stifled.\nBuck, in his role of audience, began to clap impatiently and to stamp\nwith his feet on the floor.\n\n\"No gallery!\" Emma called in from the hall.  \"Remember the\ntemperamental family on the floor below!\"  A silence--then: \"I'm\ncoming.  Shut your eyes and prepare to be jarred by the Buck\nballoon-petticoat!\"\n\nThere was a rustling of silks, a little rush to the center of the big\nroom, a breathless pause, a sharp snap of finger and thumb. Buck opened\nhis eyes.\n\nHe opened his eyes.  Then he closed them and opened them again,\nquickly, as we do, sometimes, when we are unwilling to believe that\nwhich we see.  What he beheld was this:  A very pretty, very flushed,\nvery bright-eyed woman, her blond hair dressed quaintly after the\nfashion of the early 'Sixties, her arms and shoulders bare, a pink-slip\nwith shoulder-straps in lieu of a bodice, and--he passed a bewildered\nhand over his eyes a skirt that billowed and flared and flounced and\nspread in a great, graceful circle--a skirt strangely light for all its\nfulness--a skirt like, and yet, somehow, unlike those garments seen in\nancient copies of Godey's Lady Book.\n\n\"That can't be--you don't mean--what--what IS it?\" stammered Buck,\ndismayed.\n\nEmma, her arms curved above her head like a ballet-dancer's,\npirouetted, curtsied very low so that the skirt spread all about her on\nthe floor, like the petals of a flower.\n\n\"Hoops, my dear!\"\n\n\"Hoops!\" echoed Buck, in weak protest.  \"Hoops, my DEAR!\"\n\nEmma stroked one silken fold with approving fingers.\n\n\"Our new leader for spring.\"\n\n\"But, Emma, you're joking!\"\n\nShe stared, suddenly serious.\n\n\"You mean--you don't like it!\"\n\n\"Like it!  For a fancy-dress costume, yes; but as a petticoat for\nevery-day wear, to be made up by us for our customers!  But of course\nyou're playing a trick on me.\"  He laughed a little weakly and came\ntoward her.  \"You can't catch me that way, old girl!  It's darned\nbecoming, Emma--I'll say that.\"  He bent down, smiling.  \"I'll allow\nyou to kiss me.  And then try me with the real surprise, will you?\"\n\nHer coquetry vanished.  Her smile fled with it.  Her pretty pose was\nabandoned.  Mrs. T. A. Buck, wife, gave way to Emma McChesney Buck,\nbusiness woman.  She stiffened a little, as though bracing herself for\na verbal encounter.\n\n\"You'll get used to it.  I expected you to be jolted at the first shock\nof it.  I was, myself--when the idea came to me.\"\n\nBuck passed a frenzied forefinger under his collar, as though it had\nsuddenly grown too tight for him.\n\n\"Used to it!  I don't want to get used to it!  It's preposterous!  You\ncan't be serious!  No woman would wear a garment like that!  For five\nyears skirts have been tighter and tighter----\"\n\n\"Until this summer they became tightest,\" interrupted Emma. \"They could\ngo no farther.  I knew that meant, 'About face!'  I knew it meant not a\nslightly wider skirt but a wildly wider skirt.  A skirt as bouffant as\nthe other had been scant.  I was sure it wouldn't be a gradual process\nat all but a mushroom growth--hobbles to-day, hoops to-morrow.  Study\nthe history of women's clothes, and you'll find that has always been\ntrue.\"\n\n\"Look here, Emma,\" began Buck, desperately; \"you're wrong, all wrong!\nHere, let me throw this scarf over your shoulders.  Now we'll sit down\nand talk this thing over sensibly.\"\n\n\"I'll agree to the scarf\"--she drew a soft, silken, fringed shawl about\nher and immediately one thought of a certain vivid, brilliant portrait\nof a hoop-skirted dancer--\"but don't ask me to sit down.  I'd rebound\nlike a toy balloon.  I've got to convince you of this thing.  I'll have\nto do it standing.\"\n\nBuck sank into his chair and dabbed at his forehead with his\nhandkerchief.\n\n\"You'll never convince me, sitting or standing.  Emma, I know I fought\nthe knickerbocker when you originated it, and I know that it turned out\nto be a magnificent success.  But this is different.  The knicker was\npractical; this thing's absurd--it's impossible!  This is an age of\nactivity.  In Civil War days women minced daintily along when they\nwalked at all.  They stitched on samplers by way of diversion.\"\n\n\"What has all that to do with it?\" inquired Emma sweetly.\n\n\"Everything.  Use a little logic.\"\n\n\"Logic!  In a discussion about women's dress!  T. A., I'm surprised.\"\n\n\"But, Emma, be reasonable.  Good Lord!  You're usually clear-sighted\nenough.  Our mode of living has changed in the last fifty years--our\nmethods of transit, our pastimes, customs, everything.  Imagine a woman\ntrying to climb a Fifth Avenue 'bus in one of those things.  Fancy her\nin a hot set of tennis.  Women use street-cars, automobiles, airships.\nCan you see a subway train full of hoop-skirted clerks, stenographers,\nand models? Street-car steps aren't built for it.  Office-building\nelevators can't stand for it.  Six-room apartments won't accommodate\n'em. They're fantastic, wild, improbable.  You're wrong, Emma--all\nwrong!\"\n\nShe had listened patiently enough, never once attempting to interrupt.\nBut on her lips was the maddening half-smile of one whose rebuttal is\nready.  Now she perched for a moment at the extreme edge of the arm of\na chair.  Her skirt subsided decorously.  Buck noticed that, with\nsurprise, even in the midst of his heated protest.\n\n\"T. A., you've probably forgotten, but those are the very arguments\nused when the hobble was introduced.  Preposterous, people\nsaid--impossible!  Women couldn't walk in 'em.  Wouldn't, couldn't sit\ndown in 'em.  Women couldn't run, play tennis, skate in them.  The car\nsteps were too high for them.  Well, what happened?  Women had to walk\nin them, and a new gait became the fashion.  Women took lessons in how\nto sit down in them.  They slashed them for tennis and skating.  And\nstreet-car companies all over the country lowered the car steps to\naccommodate them. What's true for the hobble holds good for the hoop.\nWomen will cease to single-foot and learn to undulate when they walk.\nThey'll widen the car platforms.  They'll sit on top the Fifth Avenue\n'buses, and you'll never give them a second thought.\"\n\n\"The things don't stay where they belong.  I've seen 'em misbehave in\nmusical comedies,\" argued Buck miserably.\n\n\"That's where my patent comes in.  The old hoop was cumbersome,\nunwieldy, clumsy.  The new skirt, by my patent featherboning process,\nis made light, graceful, easily managed.  T. A., I predict that by\nmidsummer a tight skirt will be as rare a sight as a full one was a\nyear ago.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"We're not quarreling, are we?\"\n\n\"Quarreling!  I rather think not!  A man can have his own opinion,\ncan't he?\"\n\nIt appeared, however, that he could not.  For when they had threshed it\nout, inch by inch, as might two partners whose only bond was business,\nit was Emma who won.\n\n\"Remember, I'm not convinced,\" Buck warned her; \"I'm only beaten by\nsuperior force.  But I do believe in your woman's intuition--I'll say\nthat.  It has never gone wrong.  I'm banking on it.\n\n\"It's woman's intuition when we win,\" Emma observed, thoughtfully.\n\"When we lose it's a foolish, feminine notion.\"\n\nThere were to be no half-way measures.  The skirt was to be the feature\nof the spring line.  Cutters and designers were one with Buck in\nthinking it a freak garment.  Emma reminded them that the same thing\nhad been said of the hobble on its appearance.\n\nIn February, Billy Spalding, veteran skirt-salesman, led a flying wedge\nof six on a test-trip that included the Middle West and the Coast.\nTheir sample-trunks had to be rebuilt to accommodate the new model.\nSpalding, shirt-sleeved, whistling dolorously, eyed each garment with a\nlook of bristling antagonism.  Spalding sold skirts on commission.\n\nEmma, surveying his labors, lifted a quizzical eyebrow.\n\n\"If you're going to sell that skirt as enthusiastically as you pack it,\nyou'd better stay here in New York and save the house traveling\nexpenses.\"\n\nSpalding ceased to whistle.  He held up a billowy sample and gazed at\nit.\n\n\"Honestly, Mrs. Buck, you know I'd try to sell pretzels in London if\nyou asked me to.  But do you really think any woman alive would be\ncaught wearing a garment like this in these days?\"\n\n\"Not only do I think it, Billy; I'm certain of it.  This new petticoat\nmakes me the Lincoln of the skirt trade.  I'm literally freeing my\nsisters from the shackles that have bound their ankles for five years.\"\n\nSpalding, unimpressed, folded another skirt.\n\n\"Um, maybe!  But what's that line about slaves hugging their chains?\"\n\nThe day following, Spalding and his flying squad scattered to spread\nthe light among the skirt trade.  And things went wrong from the start.\n\nThe first week showed an ominous lack of those cheering epistles\nbeginning, \"Enclosed please find,\" etc.  The second was worse. The\nthird was equally bad.  The fourth was final.  The second week in\nMarch, Spalding returned from a territory which had always been known\nas firmly wedded to the T. A. Buck Featherloom petticoat.  The Middle\nWest would have none of him.\n\nThey held the post-mortem in Emma's bright little office, and that lady\nherself seemed to be strangely sunny and undaunted, considering the\ncompleteness of her defeat.  She sat at her desk now, very interested,\nvery bright-eyed, very calm.  Buck, in a chair at the side of her desk,\nwas interested, too, but not so calm.  Spalding, who was accustomed to\ntalk while standing, leaned against the desk, feet crossed, brows\nfurrowed.  As he talked, he emphasized his remarks by jabbing the air\nwith his pencil.\n\n\"Well,\" said Emma quietly, \"it didn't go.\"\n\n\"It didn't even start,\" corrected Spalding.\n\n\"But why?\" demanded Buck.  \"Why?\"\n\nSpalding leaned forward a little, eagerly.\n\n\"I'll tell you something:  When I started out with that little garment,\nI thought it was a joke.  Before I'd been out with it a week, I began\nto like it.  In ten days, I was crazy about it, and I believed in it\nfrom the waistband to the hem.  On the level, Mrs. Buck, I think it's a\nwonder.  Now, can you explain that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Emma; \"you didn't like it at first because it was a shock\nto you.  It outraged all your ideas of what a skirt ought to be.  Then\nyou grew accustomed to it.  Then you began to see its good points.  Why\ncouldn't you make the trade get your viewpoint?\"\n\n\"This is why:  Out in Manistee and Oshkosh and Terre Haute, the girls\nhave just really learned the trick of walking in tight skirts.  It's as\nimpossible to convince a Middle West buyer that the exaggerated full\nskirt is going to be worn next summer as it would be to prove to him\nthat men are going to wear sunbonnets. They thought I was trying to\nsell 'em masquerade costumes.  I may believe in it, and you may believe\nin it, and T. A.; but the girls from Joplin--well, they're from Joplin.\nAnd they're waiting to hear from headquarters.\"\n\nT. A. Buck crossed one leg over the other and sat up with a little sigh.\n\n\"Well, that settles it, doesn't it?\" he said.\n\n\"It does not,\" replied Emma McChesney Buck crisply.  \"If they want to\nhear from headquarters, they won't have long to wait.\"\n\n\"Now, Emma, don't try to push this thing if it----\"\n\n\"T. A., please don't look so forgiving.  I'd much rather have you\nreproach me.\"\n\n\"It's you I'm thinking of, not the skirt.\"\n\n\"But I want you to think of the skirt, too.  We've gone into this\nthing, and it has cost us thousands.  Don't think I'm going to sit\nquietly by and watch those thousands trickle out of our hands.  We've\nplayed our first card.  It didn't take a trick. Here's another.\"\n\nBuck and Spalding were leaning forward, interested, attentive. There\nwas that in Emma's vivid, glowing face which did not mean defeat.\n\n\"March fifteenth, at Madison Square Garden, there is to be held the\nfirst annual exhibition of the Society for the Promotion of American\nStyles for American Women.  For one hundred years we've taken our\nfashions as Paris dictated, regardless of whether they outraged our\nsense of humor or decency or of fitness.  This year the American\ndesigner is going to have a chance.  Am I an American designer, T. A.,\nBilly?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" in chorus.\n\n\"Then I shall exhibit that skirt on a live model at the First Annual\nAmerican Fashion Show next month.  Every skirt-buyer in the country\nwill be there.  If it takes hold there, it's made--and so are we.\"\n\nMarch came, and with it an army of men and women buyers, dependent, for\nthe first time in their business careers, on the ingenuity of the\nAmerican brain.  The keen-eyed legions that had advanced on Europe\nearly, armed with letters of credit--the vast horde that returned each\nspring and autumn laden with their spoils--hats, gowns, laces, linens,\nsilks, embroideries--were obliged to content themselves with what was\nto be found in their own camp.\n\nClever manager that she was, Emma took as much pains with her model as\nwith the skirt itself.  She chose a girl whose demure prettiness and\nquiet charm would enhance the possibilities of the skirt's\npracticability in the eye of the shrewd buyer.  Gertrude, the model,\ndeveloped a real interest in the success of the petticoat.  Emma knew\nenough about the psychology of crowds to realize how this increased her\nchances for success.\n\nThe much heralded fashion show was to open at one o'clock on the\nafternoon of March fifteenth.  At ten o'clock that morning, there\nbreezed in from Chicago a tall, slim, alert young man, who made\nstraight for the offices of the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat\nCompany, walked into the junior partner's private office, and took that\nastonished lady in his two strong arms.\n\n\"Jock McChesney!\" gasped his rumpled mother, emerging from the hug.\n\"I've been hungry for a sight of you!\"  She was submerged in a second\nhug.  \"Come here to the window where I can get a real look at you!  Why\ndidn't you wire me?  What are you doing away from your own job?  How's\nbusiness?  And why come to-day, of all days, when I can't make a fuss\nover you?\"\n\nJock McChesney, bright-eyed, clear-skinned, steady of hand, stood up\nwell under the satisfied scrutiny of his adoring mother.  He smiled\ndown at her.\n\n\"Wanted to surprise you.  Here for three reasons--the Abbott\nGrape-juice advertising contract, you, and Grace.  And why can't you\nmake a fuss over me, I'd like to know?\"\n\nEmma told him.  His keen, quick mind required little in the way of\nexplanation.\n\n\"But why didn't you let me in on it sooner?\"\n\n\"Because, son, nothing explains harder than embryo success.  I always\nprefer to wait until it's grown up and let it do its own explaining.\"\n\n\"But the thing ought to have national advertising,\" Jock insisted, with\nthe advertising expert's lightning grasp of its possibilities.  \"What\nthat skirt needs is publicity.  Why didn't you let me handle----\"\n\n\"Yes, I know, dear; but you haven't seen the skirt.  It won't do to ram\nit down their throats.  I want to ease it to them first. I want them to\nget used to it.  It failed utterly on the road, because it jarred their\nnotion of what a petticoat ought to be. That's due to five years of\nsheath skirts.\"\n\n\"But suppose--just for the sake of argument--that it doesn't strike\nthem right this afternoon?\"\n\n\"Then it's gone, that's all.  Six months from now, every skirt-factory\nin the country will be manufacturing a similar garment.  People will be\nready for it then.  I've just tried to cut in ahead of the rest.\nPerhaps I shouldn't have tried to do it.\"\n\nJock hugged her again at that, to the edification of the office windows\nacross the way.\n\n\"Gad, you're a wiz, mother!  Now listen:  I 'phoned Grace when I got\nin.  She's going to meet me here at one.  I'll chase over to the office\nnow on this grape-juice thing and come back here in time for lunch.  Is\nT. A. in?  I'll look in on him a minute. We'll all lunch together, and\nthen----\"\n\n\"Can't do it, son.  The show opens at one.  Gertrude, my model, comes\non at three.  She's going to have the stage to herself for ten minutes,\nduring which she'll make four changes of costume to demonstrate the\nusefulness of the skirt for every sort of gown from chiffon to velvet.\nCome back here at one, if you like.  If I'm not here, come over to the\nshow.  But--lunch!  I'd choke.\"\n\nAt twelve-thirty, there scampered into Emma's office a very\nwhite-faced, round-eyed little stock-girl.  Emma, deep in a last-minute\ndiscussion with Buck, had a premonition of trouble before the girl\ngasped out her message.\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Buck, Gertie's awful sick!\"\n\n\"Sick!\" echoed Emma and Buck, in duet.  Then Emma:\n\n\"But she can't be!  It's impossible!  She was all right a half hour\nago.\"  She was hurrying down the hall as she spoke. \"Where is she?\"\n\n\"They've got her on one of the tables in the workroom.  She's moaning\nawful.\"\n\nGertie's appendix, with that innate sense of the dramatic so often\nfound in temperamental appendices, had indeed chosen this moment to\ncall attention to itself.  Gertie, the demurely pretty and quietly\ncharming, was rolled in a very tight ball on the workroom\ncutting-table.  At one o'clock, she was on her way home in a cab, under\nthe care of a doctor, Miss Kelly, the bookkeeper, and Jock, who, coming\nin gaily at one, had been pressed into service, bewildered but willing.\n\nThree rather tragic figures stared at one another in the junior\npartner's office.  They were Emma, Buck, and Grace Galt, Jock's\nwife-to-be.  Grace Galt, slim, lovely, girlish, was known, at\ntwenty-four, as one of the most expert copy writers in the advertising\nworld.  In her clear-headed, capable manner, she tried to suggest a way\nout of the difficulty now.\n\n\"But surely the world's full of girls,\" she said.  \"It's late, I know;\nbut any theatrical agency will send a girl over.\"\n\n\"That's just what I tried to avoid,\" Emma replied.  \"I wanted to show\nthis skirt on a sweet, pretty, refined sort of girl who looks and acts\nlike a lady.  One of those blond show girls would kill it.\"\n\nGloom settled down again over the three.  Emma broke the silence with a\nrueful little laugh.\n\n\"I think,\" she said, \"that perhaps you're right, T. A., and this is the\nLord's way of showing me that the world is not quite ready for this\nskirt.\"\n\n\"You're not beaten yet, Emma,\" Buck assured her vigorously. \"How about\nthis new girl--what's her name?--Myrtle.  She's one of those thin, limp\nones, isn't she?  Try her.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said Emma.  \"You're right.  I'm not beaten yet. I've had to\nfight for everything worth while in my life.  I'm superstitious about\nit now.  When things come easy I'm afraid of them.\"  Then, to the\nstock-girl, \"Annie, tell Myrtle I want to see her.\"\n\nSilence fell again upon the three.  Myrtle, very limp, very thin, very\nlanguid indeed, roused them at her entrance.  The hopeful look in\nEmma's eyes faded as she beheld her.  Myrtle was so obviously limp, so\nhopelessly new.\n\n\"Annie says you want me to take Gertie's place,\" drawled Myrtle,\nstriking a magazine-cover attitude.\n\n\"I don't know that you are just the--er--type; but perhaps, if you're\nwilling----\"\n\n\"Of course I didn't come here as a model,\" said Myrtle, and sagged on\nthe other hip. \"But, as a special favor to you I'm willing to try\nit--at special model's rates.\"\n\nEmma ran a somewhat frenzied hand through her hair.\n\n\"Then, as a special favor to me, will you begin by trying to stand up\nstraight, please?  That debutante slouch would kill a queen's\ncoronation costume.\"\n\nMyrtle straightened, slumped again.\n\n\"I can't help it if I am willowy\"--listlessly.\n\n\"Your hair!\" Myrtle's hand went vaguely to her head.  \"I can't have you\nwear it that way.\"\n\n\"Why, this is the French roll!\" protested Myrtle, offended.\n\n\"Then do it in a German bun!\" snapped Emma.  \"Any way but that.  Will\nyou walk, please?\"\n\n\"Walk?\"--dully.\n\n\"Yes, walk; I want to see how you----\"\n\nMyrtle walked across the room.  A groan came from Emma.\n\n\"I thought so.\"  She took a long breath.\n\n\"Myrtle, listen:  That Australian crawl was necessary when our skirts\nwere so narrow we had to negotiate a curbing before we could take it.\nBut the skirt you're going to demonstrate is wide.  Like that!  You're\npractically a free woman in it.  Step out!  Stride!  Swing!  Walk!\"\n\nMyrtle tried it, stumbled, sulked.\n\nEmma, half smiling, half woeful, patted the girl's shoulder.\n\n\"Oh, I see; you're wearing a tight one.  Well, run in and get into the\nskirt.  Miss Loeb will help you.  Then come back here--and quickly,\nplease.\"\n\nThe three looked at each other in silence.  It was a silence brimming\nwith eloquent meaning.  Each sought encouragement in the eyes of the\nother--and failed to find it.  Failing, they broke into helpless\nlaughter.  It proved a safety-valve.\n\n\"She may do, Emma--when she has her hair done differently, and if\nshe'll only stand up.\"\n\nBut Emma shook her head.\n\n\"T. A., something tells me you're going to have a wonderful chance to\nsay, 'I told you so!' at three o'clock this afternoon.\"\n\n\"You know I wouldn't say it, Emma.\"\n\n\"Yes; I do know it, dear.  But what's the difference, if the chance is\nthere?\"\n\nSuspense settled down on the little office.  Billy Spalding entered,\nsmiling.  After five minutes of waiting, even his buoyant spirits sank.\n\n\"Don't you think--if you were to go in and--and sort of help adjust\nthings----\" suggested Buck vaguely.\n\n\"No; I don't want to prop her up.  She'll have to stand alone when she\ngets there.  She'll either do, or not.  When she enters that door, I'll\nknow.\"\n\nWhen Myrtle entered, wearing the fascinatingly fashioned new model,\nthey all knew.\n\nEmma spoke decisively.\n\n\"That settles it.\"\n\n\"What's the matter?  Don't it look all right?\" demanded Myrtle.\n\n\"Take it off, Myrtle.\"\n\nThen, to the others, as Myrtle, sulking, left the room:\n\n\"I can stand to see that skirt die if necessary.  But I won't help\nmurder it.\"\n\n\"But, Mrs. Buck,\" protested Spalding, almost tearfully, \"you've got to\nexhibit that skirt.  You've got to!\"\n\nEmma shook a sorrowing head.\n\n\"That wouldn't be an exhibition, Billy.  It would be an expose.\"\n\nSpalding clapped a desperate hand to his bald head.\n\n\"If only I had Julian Eltinge's shape, I'd wear it to the show for you\nmyself.\"\n\n\"That's all it needs now,\" retorted Emma grimly.\n\nWhereupon, Grace Galt spoke up in her clear, decisive voice.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" she said quietly.  \"I'm going to wear that skirt at\nthe fashion show.\"\n\n\"You!\" cried the three, like a trained trio.\n\n\"Why not?\" demanded Grace Galt, coolly.  Then:  \"No; don't tell me why\nnot.  I won't listen.\"\n\nBut Emma, equally cool, would have none of it.\n\n\"It's impossible, dear.  You're an angel to want to help me. But you\nmust know it's quite out of the question.\"\n\n\"It's nothing of the kind.  This skirt isn't merely a fad.  It has a\nfortune in it.  I'm business woman enough to know that. You've got to\nlet me do it.  It isn't only for yourself.  It's for T. A. and for the\nfuture of the firm.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I'd allow you to stand up before all those people?\"\n\n\"Why not?  I don't know them.  They don't know me.  I can make them get\nthe idea in that skirt.  And I'm going to do it.  You don't object to\nme on the same grounds that you did to Myrtle, do you?\"\n\n\"You!\" burst from the admiring Spalding.  \"Say, you'd make a\nred-flannel petticoat look like crepe de Chine and lace.\"\n\n\"There!\" said Grace, triumphant.  \"That settles it!\"  And she was off\ndown the hall.  They stood a moment in stunned silence. Then:\n\n\"But Jock!\" protested Emma, following her.  \"What will Jock say? Grace!\nGrace dear!  I can't let you do it!  I can't!\"\n\n\"Just unhook this for me, will you?\" replied Grace Galt sweetly.\n\nAt two o'clock, Jock McChesney, returned from his errand of mercy,\nburst into the office to find mother, step-father, and fiancee all\nflown.\n\n\"Where?  What?\" he demanded of the outer office.\n\n\"Fashion show!\" chorused the office staff\n\n\"Might have waited for me,\" Jock said to himself, much injured. And\nhurled himself into a taxi.\n\nThere was a crush of motors and carriages for a block on all sides of\nMadison Square Garden.  He had to wait for what seemed an interminable\ntime at the box-office.  Then he began the task of worming his way\nthrough the close-packed throng in the great auditorium.  It was a\ncrowd such as the great place had not seen since the palmy days of the\nhorse show.  It was a crowd that sparkled and shone in silks and\nfeathers and furs and jewels.\n\n\"Jove, if mother has half a chance at this gang!\" Jock told himself.\n\"If only she has grabbed some one who can really show that skirt!\"\n\nHe was swept with the crowd toward a high platform at the extreme end\nof the auditorium.  All about that platform stood hundreds, close\npacked, faces raised eagerly, the better to see the slight, graceful,\ngirlish figure occupying the center of the stage--a figure strangely\nfamiliar to Jock's eyes in spite of its quaintly billowing, ante-bellum\ngarb.  She was speaking.  Jock, mouth agape, eyes protruding, ears\nstraining, heard, as in a daze, the sweet, clear, charmingly modulated\nvoice:\n\n\"The feature of the skirt, ladies and gentlemen, is that it gives a\nfulness without weight, something which the skirt-maker has never\nbefore been able to achieve.  This is due to the patent featherboning\nprocess invented by Mrs. T. A. Buck, of the T. A. Buck Featherloom\nPetticoat Company, New York.  Note, please, that it has all the\nadvantages of our grandmother's hoop-skirt, but none of its awkward\nfeatures.  It is graceful\"--she turned slowly, lightly--\"it is\nbouffant\" she twirled on her toes--\"it is practical, serviceable,\nelegant.  It can be made up in any shade, in any material--silk, lace,\ncrepe de Chine, charmeuse, taffeta.  The T. A. Buck Featherloom\nPetticoat Company is prepared to fill orders for immediate----\"\n\n\"Well, I'll be darned!\" said Jock McChesney aloud.  And, again,\nheedless of the protesting \"Sh-sh-sh-sh!\" that his neighbors turned\nupon him, \"Well, I'll--be--darned!\"\n\nA hand twitched his coat sleeve.  He turned, still dazed.  His mother,\nvery pink-cheeked, very bright-eyed, pulled him through the throng.  As\nthey reached the edge of the crowd, there came a great burst of\napplause, a buzz of conversation, the turning, shifting, nodding,\nstaccato movements which mean approval in a mass of people.\n\n\"What the dickens!  How!\" stammered Jock.  \"When--did she--did she----\"\n\nEmma, half smiling, half tearful, raised a protesting hand.\n\n\"I don't know.  Don't ask me, dear.  And don't hate me for it. I tried\nto tell her not to, but she insisted.  And, Jock, she's done it, I tell\nyou!  She's done it!  They love the skirt! Listen to 'em!\"\n\n\"Don't want to,\" said Jock.  \"Lead me to her.\"\n\n\"Angry, dear!\"\n\n\"Me?  No!  I'm--I'm proud of her!  She hasn't only brains and looks,\nthat little girl; she's got nerve--the real kind!  Gee, how did I ever\nhave the gall to ask her to marry me!\"\n\nTogether they sped toward the door that led to the dressing-rooms.\nBuck, his fine eyes more luminous than ever as he looked at this\nwonder-wife of his, met them at the entrance.\n\n\"She's waiting for you, Jock,\" he said, smiling.  Jock took the steps\nin one leap.\n\n\"Well, T. A.?\" said Emma.\n\n\"Well, Emma?\" said T. A.\n\nWhich burst of eloquence was interrupted abruptly by a short, squat,\ndark man, who seized Emma's hand in his left and Buck's in his right,\nand pumped them up and down vigorously.  It was that volatile, voluble\nperson known to the skirt trade as Abel I. Fromkin, of the \"Fromkin\nForm-fit Skirt.  It Clings!\"\n\n\"I'm looking everywhere for you!\" he panted.  Then, his shrewd little\neyes narrowing, \"You want to talk business?\"\n\n\"Not here,\" said Buck abruptly.\n\n\"Sure--here,\" insisted Fromkin.  \"Say, that's me.  When I got a thing\non my mind, I like to settle it.  How much you take for the rights to\nthat skirt?\"\n\n\"Take for it!\" exclaimed Emma, in the tone a mother would use to one\nwho has suggested taking a beloved child from her.\n\n\"Now wait a minute.  Don't get mad.  You ain't started that skirt\nright.  It should have been advertised.  It's too much of a shock.\nYou'll see.  They won't buy.  They're afraid of it.  I'll take it off\nyour hands and push it right, see?  I offer you forty thousand for the\nrights to make that skirt and advertise it as the 'Fromkin Full-flounce\nSkirt.  It Flares!'\"\n\nEmma smiled.\n\n\"How much?\" she asked quizzically.\n\nAbel I. Fromkin gulped.\n\n\"Fifty thousand,\" he said.\n\n\"Fifty thousand,\" repeated Emma quietly, and looked at Buck. \"Thanks,\nMr. Fromkin!  I know, now, that if it's worth fifty thousand to you\nto-day as the 'Fromkin Full-flounce Skirt.  It Flares!' then it's worth\none hundred and fifty thousand to us as the 'T. A. Buck\nBalloon-Petticoat.  It Billows!'\"\n\nAnd it was.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nSISTERS UNDER THEIR SKIN\n\nWomen who know the joys and sorrows of a pay envelope do not speak of\ngirls who work as Working Girls.  Neither do they use the term Laboring\nClass, as one would speak of a distinct and separate race, like the\nEthiopian.\n\nEmma McChesney Buck was no exception to this rule.  Her fifteen years\nof man-size work for a man-size salary in the employ of the T. A. Buck\nFeatherloom Petticoat Company, New York, precluded that.  In those\ndays, she had been Mrs. Emma McChesney, known from coast to coast as\nthe most successful traveling saleswoman in the business.  It was due\nto her that no feminine clothes-closet was complete without a\nFeatherloom dangling from one hook.  During those fifteen years she had\neducated her son, Jock McChesney, and made a man of him; she had\nworked, fought, saved, triumphed, smiled under hardship; and she had\nacquired a broad and deep knowledge of those fascinating and\ndiversified subjects which we lump carelessly under the heading of\nHuman Nature.  She was Mrs. T. A. Buck now, wife of the head of the\nfirm, and partner in the most successful skirt manufactory in the\ncountry.  But the hard-working, clear-thinking, sane-acting habits of\nthose fifteen years still clung.\n\nPerhaps this explained why every machine-girl in the big, bright shop\nback of the offices raised adoring eyes when Emma entered the workroom.\nItalian, German, Hungarian, Russian--they lifted their faces toward\nthis source of love and sympathetic understanding as naturally as a\nplant turns its leaves toward the sun.  They glowed under her praise;\nthey confided to her their troubles; they came to her with their\njoys--and they copied her clothes.\n\nThis last caused her some uneasiness.  When Mrs. T. A. Buck wore blue\nserge, an epidemic of blue serge broke out in the workroom. Did Emma's\nspring hat flaunt flowers, the elevators, at closing time, looked like\ngardens abloom.  If she appeared on Monday morning in severely tailored\nwhite-linen blouse, the shop on Tuesday was a Boston seminary in its\nstarched primness.\n\n\"It worries me,\" Emma told her husband-partner.  \"I can't help thinking\nof the story of the girl and the pet chameleon. What would happen if I\nwere to forget myself some day and come down to work in black velvet\nand pearls?\"\n\n\"They'd manage it somehow,\" Buck assured her.  \"I don't know just how;\nbut I'm sure that twenty-four hours later our shop would look like a\nBuckingham drawing-room when the court is in mourning.\"\n\nEmma never ceased to marvel at their ingenuity, at their almost uncanny\nclothes-instinct.  Their cheap skirts hung and fitted with an art as\nperfect as that of a Fifty-seventh Street modiste; their blouses, in\nsome miraculous way, were of to-day's style, down to the last detail of\ncuff or collar or stitching; their hats were of the shape that the\nseason demanded, set at the angle that the season approved, and\nfinished with just that repression of decoration which is known as\n\"single trimming.\" They wore their clothes with a chic that would make\nthe far-famed Parisian outriere look dowdy and down at heel in\ncomparison.  Upper Fifth Avenue, during the shopping or tea-hour, has\nbeen sung, painted, vaunted, boasted.  Its furs and millinery, its eyes\nand figure, its complexion and ankles have flashed out at us from ten\nthousand magazine covers, have been adjectived in reams of\nSunday-supplement stories.  Who will picture Lower Fifth Avenue between\nfive and six, when New York's unsung beauties pour into the streets\nfrom a thousand loft-buildings?  Theirs is no mere empty pink-and-white\nprettiness.  Poverty can make prettiness almost poignantly lovely, for\nit works with a scalpel.  Your Twenty-sixth Street beauty has a certain\nwistful appeal that your Forty-sixth Street beauty lacks; her very\nbravado, too, which falls just short of boldness, adds a final piquant\ntouch. In the face of the girl who works, whether she be a\nspindle-legged errand-girl or a ten-thousand-a-year foreign buyer, you\nwill find both vivacity and depth of expression.  What she loses in\nsoftness and bloom she gains in a something that peeps from her eyes,\nthat lurks in the corners of her mouth. Emma never tired of studying\nthem--these girls with their firm, slim throats, their lovely faces,\ntheir Oriental eyes, and their conscious grace.  Often, as she looked,\nan unaccountable mist of tears would blur her vision.\n\nSo that sunny little room whose door was marked \"MRS. BUCK\" had come to\nbe more than a mere private office for the transaction of business.  It\nwas a clearing-house for trouble; it was a shrine, a confessional, and\na court of justice.  When Carmela Colarossi, her face swollen with\nweeping, told a story of parental harshness grown unbearable, Emma\nwould put aside business to listen, and six o'clock would find her\nseated in the dark and smelly Colarossi kitchen, trying, with all her\ntact and patience and sympathy, to make home life possible again for\nthe flashing-eyed Carmela.  When the deft, brown fingers of Otti Markis\nbecame clumsy at her machine, and her wage slumped unaccountably from\nsixteen to six dollars a week, it was in Emma's quiet little office\nthat it became clear why Otti's eyes were shadowed and why Otti's mouth\ndrooped so pathetically.  Emma prescribed a love philter made up of\ncommon sense, understanding, and world-wisdom. Otti took it, only half\ncomprehending, but sure of its power.  In a week, Otti's eyes were\nshadowless, her lips smiling, her pay-envelope bulging.  But it was in\nSophy Kumpf that the T. A. Buck Company best exemplified its policy.\nSophy Kumpf had come to Buck's thirty years before, slim, pink-cheeked,\nbrown-haired. She was a grandmother now, at forty-six, broad-bosomed,\nbroad-hipped, but still pink of cheek and brown of hair.  In those\nthirty years she had spent just three away from Buck's. She had brought\nher children into the world; she had fed them and clothed them and sent\nthem to school, had Sophy, and seen them married, and helped them to\nbring their children into the world in turn.  In her round, red,\nwholesome face shone a great wisdom, much love, and that infinite\nunderstanding which is born only of bitter experience.  She had come to\nBuck's when old T. A. was just beginning to make Featherlooms a\nnational institution.  She had seen his struggles, his prosperity; she\nhad grieved at his death; she had watched young T. A. take the reins in\nhis unaccustomed hands, and she had gloried in Emma McChesney's rise\nfrom office to salesroom, from salesroom to road, from road to private\noffice and recognized authority.  Sophy had left her early work far\nbehind.  She had her own desk now in the busy workshop, and it was she\nwho allotted the piece-work, marked it in her much-thumbed ledger--that\npowerful ledger which, at the week's end, decided just how plump or\nthin each pay-envelope would be.  So the shop and office at T. A.\nBuck's were bound together by many ties of affection and sympathy and\nloyalty; and these bonds were strongest where, at one end, they touched\nEmma McChesney Buck, and, at the other, faithful Sophy Kumpf.  Each a\ntriumphant example of Woman in Business.\n\nIt was at this comfortable stage of Featherloom affairs that the\nMovement struck the T. A. Buck Company.  Emma McChesney Buck had never\nmingled much in movements.  Not that she lacked sympathy with them; she\noften approved of them, heart and soul.  But she had been heard to say\nthat the Movers got on her nerves.  Those well-dressed, glib, staccato\nladies who spoke with such ease from platforms and whose pictures\nstared out at one from the woman's page failed, somehow, to convince\nher.  When Emma approved a new movement, it was generally in spite of\nthem, never because of them.  She was brazenly unapologetic when she\nsaid that she would rather listen to ten minutes of Sophy Kumpf's\nworld-wisdom than to an hour's talk by the most magnetic and\nsilken-clad spellbinder in any cause.  For fifteen business years, in\nthe office, on the road, and in the thriving workshop, Emma McChesney\nhad met working women galore.  Women in offices, women in stores, women\nin hotels--chamber-maids, clerks, buyers, waitresses, actresses in road\ncompanies, women demonstrators, occasional traveling saleswomen, women\nin factories, scrubwomen, stenographers, models--every grade, type and\nvariety of working woman, trained and untrained.  She never missed a\nchance to talk with them.  She never failed to learn from them.  She\nhad been one of them, and still was. She was in the position of one who\nis on the inside, looking out.  Those other women urging this cause or\nthat were on the outside, striving to peer in.\n\nThe Movement struck T. A. Buck's at eleven o'clock Monday morning.\nEleven o'clock Monday morning in the middle of a busy fall season is\nnot a propitious moment for idle chit-chat.  The three women who\nstepped out of the lift at the Buck Company's floor looked very much\nout of place in that hummingly busy establishment and appeared, on the\nsurface, at least, very chit-chatty indeed.  So much so, that T. A.\nBuck, glancing up from the cards which had preceded them, had\ndifficulty in repressing a frown of annoyance.  T. A. Buck, during his\ncollege-days, and for a lamentably long time after, had been known as\n\"Beau\" Buck, because of his faultless clothes and his charming manner.\nHis eyes had something to do with it, too, no doubt.  He had lived down\nthe title by sheer force of business ability.  No one thought of using\nthe nickname now, though the clothes, the manner, and the eyes were the\nsame.  At the entrance of the three women, he had been engrossed in the\ndifficult task of selling a fall line to Mannie Nussbaum, of Portland,\nOregon. Mannie was what is known as a temperamental buyer.  He couldn't\nbe forced; he couldn't be coaxed; he couldn't be led.  But when he\nliked a line he bought like mad, never cancelled, and T. A. Buck had\njust got him going.  It spoke volumes for his self-control that he\ncould advance toward the waiting three, his manner correct, his\nexpression bland.\n\n\"I am Mr. Buck,\" he said.  \"Mrs. Buck is very much engaged.  I\nunderstand your visit has something to do with the girls in the shop.\nI'm sure our manager will be able to answer any questions----\"\n\nThe eldest women raised a protesting, white-gloved hand.\n\n\"Oh, no--no, indeed!  We must see Mrs. Buck.\"  She spoke in the crisp,\ndecisive platform-tones of one who is often addressed as \"Madam\nChairman.\"\n\nBuck took a firmer grip on his self-control.\n\n\"I'm sorry; Mrs. Buck is in the cutting-room.\"\n\n\"We'll wait,\" said the lady, brightly.  She stepped back a pace.  \"This\nis Miss Susan H. Croft\"--indicating a rather sparse person of very\ncertain years--\"But I need scarcely introduce her.\"\n\n\"Scarcely,\" murmured Buck, and wondered why.\n\n\"This is my daughter, Miss Gladys Orton-Wells.\"\n\nBuck found himself wondering why this slim, negative creature should\nhave such sad eyes.  There came an impatient snort from Mannie\nNussbaum.  Buck waved a hasty hand in the direction of Emma's office.\n\n\"If you'll wait there, I'll send in to Mrs. Buck.\"\n\nThe three turned toward Emma's bright little office.  Buck scribbled a\nhasty word on one of the cards.\n\nEmma McChesney Buck was leaning over the great cutting-table, shears in\nhand.  It might almost be said that she sprawled.  Her eyes were very\nbright, and her cheeks were very pink.  Across the table stood a\ndesigner and two cutters, and they were watching Emma with an\nintentness as flattering as it was sincere.  They were looking not only\nat cloth but at an idea.\n\n\"Get that?\" asked Emma crisply, and tapped the pattern spread before\nher with the point of her shears.  \"That gives you the fulness without\nbunching, d'you see?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" assented Koritz, head designer; \"but when you get it cut you'll\nfind this piece is wasted, ain't it?\"  He marked out a triangular\nsection of cloth with one expert forefinger.\n\n\"No; that works into the ruffle,\" explained Emma.  \"Here, I'll cut it.\nThen you'll see.\"\n\nShe grasped the shears firmly in her right hand, smoothed the cloth\nspread before her with a nervous little pat of her left, pushed her\nbright hair back from her forehead, and prepared to cut.  At which\ncritical moment there entered Annie, the errand-girl, with the three\nbits of white pasteboard.\n\nEmma glanced down at them and waved Annie away.\n\n\"Can't see them.  Busy.\"\n\nAnnie stood her ground.\n\n\"Mr. Buck said you'd see 'em.  They're waiting.\"\n\nEmma picked up one of the cards.  On it Buck had scribbled a single\nword:  \"Movers.\"  Mrs. T. A. Buck smiled.  A little malicious gleam\ncame into her eyes.\n\n\"Show 'em in here, Annie,\" she commanded, with a wave of the huge\nshears.  \"I'll teach 'em to interrupt me when I've got my hands in the\nbluing-water.\"\n\nShe bent over the table again, measuring with her keen eye.  When the\nthree were ushered in a moment later, she looked up briefly and nodded,\nthen bent over the table again.  But in that brief moment she had the\nthree marked, indexed and pigeonholed.  If one could have looked into\nthat lightning mind of hers, one would have found something like this:\n\n\"Hmm!  What Ida Tarbell calls 'Restless women.'  Money, and always have\nhad it.  Those hats were born in one of those exclusive little shops\noff the Avenue.  Rich but somber.  They think they're advanced, but\nthey still resent the triumph of the motor-car over the horse.  That\ngirl can't call her soul her own. Good eyes, but too sad.  He probably\ndidn't suit mother.\"\n\nWhat she said was:\n\n\"Howdy-do.  We're just bringing a new skirt into the world.  I thought\nyou might like to be in at the birth.\"\n\n\"How very interesting!\" chirped the two older women.  The girl said\nnothing, but a look of anticipation brightened her eyes.  It deepened\nand glowed as Emma McChesney Buck bent to her task and the great jaws\nof the shears opened and shut on the virgin cloth. Six pairs of eyes\nfollowed the fascinating steel before which the cloth rippled and fell\naway, as water is cleft by the prow of a stanch little boat.  Around\nthe curves went the shears, guided by Emma's firm white hands,\nsnipping, slashing, doubling on itself, a very swashbuckler of a shears.\n\n\"There!\" exclaimed Emma at last, and dropped the shears on the table\nwith a clatter.  \"Put that together and see whether it makes a skirt or\nnot.   Now, ladies!\"\n\nThe three drew a long breath.  It was the sort of sound that comes up\nfrom the crowd when a sky-rocket has gone off successfully, with a\nfinal shower of stars.\n\n\"Do you do that often?\" ventured Mrs. Orton-Wells.\n\n\"Often enough to keep my hand in,\" replied Emma, and led the way to her\noffice.\n\nThe three followed in silence.  They were strangely silent, too, as\nthey seated themselves around Emma Buck's desk.  Curiously enough, it\nwas the subdued Miss Orton-Wells who was the first to speak.\n\n\"I'll never rest,\" she said, \"until I see that skirt finished and\nactually ready to wear.\"\n\nShe smiled at Emma.  When she did that, you saw that Miss Orton-Wells\nhad her charm.  Emma smiled back, and patted the girl's hand just once.\nAt that there came a look into Miss Orton-Wells' eyes, and you saw that\nmost decidedly she had her charm.\n\nUp spoke Mrs. Orton-Wells.\n\n\"Gladys is such an enthusiast!  That's really her reason for being\nhere.  Gladys is very much interested in working girls.  In fact, we\nare all, as you probably know, intensely interested in the working\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Thank you!\" said Emma McChesney Buck.\n\n\"That's very kind.  We working women are very grateful to you.\"\n\n\"We!\" exclaimed Mrs. Orton-Wells and Miss Susan Croft blankly, and in\nperfect time.\n\nEmma smiled sweetly.\n\n\"Surely you'll admit that I'm a working woman.\"\n\nMiss Susan H. Croft was not a person to be trifled with.  She\nelucidated acidly.\n\n\"We mean women who work with their hands.\"\n\n\"By what power do you think those shears were moved across the\ncutting-table?  We don't cut our patterns with an ouija-board.\"\n\nMrs. Orton-Wells rustled protestingly.\n\n\"But, my dear Mrs. Buck, you know, we mean women of the Laboring Class.\"\n\n\"I'm in this place of business from nine to five, Monday to Saturday,\ninclusive.  If that doesn't make me a member of the laboring class I\ndon't want to belong.\"\n\nIt was here that Mrs. Orton-Wells showed herself a woman not to be\ntrifled with.  She moved forward to the edge of her chair, fixed Emma\nBuck with determined eyes, and swept into midstream, sails spread.\n\n\"Don't be frivolous, Mrs. Buck.  We are here on a serious errand.  It\nought to interest you vitally because of the position you occupy in the\nworld of business.  We are launching a campaign against the\nextravagant, ridiculous, and oftentimes indecent dress of the working\ngirl, with especial reference to the girl who works in garment\nfactories.  They squander their earnings in costumes absurdly unfitted\nto their station in life.  Our plan is to influence them in the\ndirection of neatness, modesty, and economy in dress.  At present each\ntries to outdo the other in style and variety of costume.  Their shoes\nare high-heeled, cloth-topped, their blouses lacy and collarless, their\nhats absurd.  We propose a costume which shall be neat, becoming, and\nappropriate.  Not exactly a uniform, perhaps, but something with a\nfixed idea in cut, color, and style.  A corps of twelve young ladies\nbelonging to our best families has been chosen to speak to the shop\ngirls at noon meetings on the subject of good taste, health, and\nmorality in women's dress.  My daughter Gladys is one of them.  In this\nway, we hope to convince them that simplicity, and practicality, and\nneatness are the only proper notes in the costume of the working girl.\nOccupying as you do a position unique in the business world, Mrs. Buck,\nwe expect much from your cooperation with us in this cause.\"\n\nEmma McChesney Buck had been gazing at Mrs. Orton-Wells with an\nintentness as flattering as it was unfeigned.  But at the close of Mrs.\nOrton-Wells' speech she was strangely silent.  She glanced down at her\nshoes.  Now, Emma McChesney Buck had a weakness for smart shoes which\nher slim, well-arched foot excused.  Hers were what might be called\nintelligent-looking feet.  There was nothing thick, nothing clumsy,\nnothing awkward about them.  And Emma treated them with the\nconsideration they deserved.  They were shod now, in a pair of slim,\naristocratic, and modish ties above which the grateful eye caught a\nflashing glimpse of black-silk stocking.  Then her eye traveled up her\nsmartly tailored skirt, up the bodice of that well-made and becoming\ncostume until her glance rested on her own shoulder and paused.  Then\nshe looked up at Mrs. Orton-Wells.  The eyes of Mrs. Orton-Wells, Miss\nSusan H. Croft, and Miss Gladys Orton-Wells had, by some strange power\nof magnetism, followed the path of Emma's eyes.  They finished just one\nsecond behind her, so that when she raised her eyes it was to encounter\ntheirs.\n\n\"I have explained,\" retorted Mrs. Orton-Wells, tartly, in reply to\nnothing, seemingly, \"that our problem is with the factory girl.  She\nrepresents a distinct and separate class.\"\n\nEmma McChesney Buck nodded:\n\n\"I understand.  Our girls are very young--eighteen, twenty, twenty-two.\nAt eighteen, or thereabouts, practical garments haven't the strong\nappeal that you might think they have.\"\n\n\"They should have,\" insisted Mrs. Orton-Wells.\n\n\"Maybe,\" said Emma Buck gently.  \"But to me it seems just as reasonable\nto argue that an apple tree has no right to wear pink-and-white\nblossoms in the spring, so long as it is going to bear sober russets in\nthe autumn.\"\n\nMiss Susan H. Croft rustled indignantly.\n\n\"Then you refuse to work with us?  You will not consent to Miss\nOrton-Wells' speaking to the girls in your shop this noon?\"\n\nEmma looked at Gladys Orton-Wells.  Gladys was wearing black, and black\ndid not become her.  It made her creamy skin sallow.  Her suit was\nseverely tailored, and her hat was small and harshly outlined, and her\nhair was drawn back from her face.  All this, in spite of the fact that\nMiss Orton-Wells was of the limp and fragile type, which demands\nruffles, fluffiness, flowing lines and frou-frou.  Emma's glance at the\nsuppressed Gladys was as fleeting as it was keen, but it sufficed to\nbring her to a decision.  She pressed a buzzer at her desk.\n\n\"I shall be happy to have Miss Orton-Wells speak to the girls in our\nshop this noon, and as often as she cares to speak.  If she can\nconvince the girls that a--er--fixed idea in cut, color, and style is\nthe thing to be adopted by shop-workers I am perfectly willing that\nthey be convinced.\"\n\nThen to Annie, who appeared in answer to the buzzer,\n\n\"Will you tell Sophy Kumpf to come here, please?\"\n\nMrs. Orton-Wells beamed.  The somber plumes in her correct hat bobbed\nand dipped to Emma.  The austere Miss Susan H. Croft unbent in a\nnutcracker smile.  Only Miss Gladys Orton-Wells remained silent,\nthoughtful, unenthusiastic.  Her eyes were on Emma's face.\n\nA heavy, comfortable step sounded in the hall outside the office door.\nEmma turned with a smile to the stout, motherly, red-cheeked woman who\nentered, smoothing her coarse brown hair with work-roughened fingers.\n\nEmma took one of those calloused hands in hers.\n\n\"Sophy, we need your advice.  This is Mrs. Sophy Kumpf--Mrs.\nOrton-Wells, Miss Susan H. Croft\"--Sophy threw her a keen glance; she\nknew that name--\"and Miss Orton-Wells.\"  Of the four, Sophy was the\nmost at ease.\n\n\"Pleased to meet you,\" said Sophy Kumpf.\n\nThe three bowed, but did not commit themselves.  Emma, her hand still\non Sophy's, elaborated:\n\n\"Sophy Kumpf has been with the T. A. Buck Company for thirty years.\nShe could run this business single-handed, if she had to. She knows any\nmachine in the shop, can cut a pattern, keep books, run the entire\nplant if necessary.  If there's anything about petticoats that Sophy\ndoesn't know, it's because it hasn't been invented yet.  Sophy was\nsixteen when she came to Buck's.  I've heard she was the prettiest and\nbest dressed girl in the shop.\"\n\n\"Oh, now, Mrs. Buck!\" remonstrated Sophy.\n\nEmma tried to frown as she surveyed Sophy's bright eyes, her rosy\ncheeks, her broad bosom, her ample hips--all that made Sophy an object\nto comfort and rest the eye.\n\n\"Don't dispute, Sophy.  Sophy has educated her children, married them\noff, and welcomed their children.  She thinks that excuses her for\nhaving been frivolous and extravagant at sixteen.  But we know better,\ndon't we?  I'm using you as a horrible example, Sophy.\"\n\nSophy turned affably to the listening three.\n\n\"Don't let her string you,\" she said, and winked one knowing eye.\n\nMrs. Orton-Wells stiffened.  Miss Susan H. Croft congealed.  But Miss\nGladys Orton-Wells smiled.  And then Emma knew she was right.\n\n\"Sophy, who's the prettiest girl in our shop?  And the best dressed?\"\n\n\"Lily Bernstein,\" Sophy made prompt answer.\n\n\"Send her in to us, will you?  And give her credit for lost time when\nshe comes back to the shop.\"\n\nSophy, with a last beamingly good-natured smile, withdrew.  Five\nminutes later, when Lily Bernstein entered the office, Sophy qualified\nas a judge of beauty.  Lily Bernstein was a tiger-lily--all browns and\ngolds and creams, all graciousness and warmth and lovely curves.  As\nshe came into the room, Gladys Orton-Wells seemed as bloodless and pale\nand ineffectual as a white moth beside a gorgeous tawny butterfly.\n\nEmma presented the girl as formally as she had Sophy Kumpf.  And Lily\nBernstein smiled upon them, and her teeth were as white and even as one\nknew they would be before she smiled.  Lily had taken off her\nshop-apron.  Her gown was blue serge, cheap in quality, flawless as to\ncut and fit, and incredibly becoming.  Above it, her vivid face glowed\nlike a golden rose.\n\n\"Lily,\" said Emma, \"Miss Orton-Wells is going to speak to the girls\nthis noon.  I thought you might help by telling her whatever she wants\nto know about the girls' work and all that, and by making her feel at\nhome.\"\n\n\"Well, sure,\" said Lily, and smiled again her heart-warming smile.\n\"I'd love to.\"\n\n\"Miss Orton-Wells,\" went on Emma smoothly, \"wants to speak to the girls\nabout clothes.\"\n\nLily looked again at Miss Orton-Wells, and she did not mean to be\ncruel.  Then she looked quickly at Emma, to detect a possible joke.\nBut Mrs. Buck's face bore no trace of a smile.\n\n\"Clothes!\" repeated Lily.  And a slow red mounted to Gladys\nOrton-Wells' pale face. When Lily went out Sunday afternoons, she might\nhave passed for a millionaire's daughter if she hadn't been so well\ndressed.\n\n\"Suppose you take Miss Orton-Wells into the shop,\" suggested Emma, \"so\nthat she may have some idea of the size and character of our family\nbefore she speaks to it.  How long shall you want to speak?\"\n\nMiss Orton-Wells started nervously, stammered a little, stopped.\n\n\"Oh, ten minutes,\" said Mrs. Orton-Wells graciously.\n\n\"Five,\" said Gladys, quickly, and followed Lily Bernstein into the\nworkroom.\n\nMrs. Orton-Wells and Miss Susan H. Croft gazed after them.\n\n\"Rather attractive, that girl, in a coarse way,\" mused Mrs.\nOrton-Wells.  \"If only we can teach them to avoid the cheap and tawdry.\nIf only we can train them to appreciate the finer things in life.  Of\ncourse, their life is peculiar.  Their problems are not our problems;\ntheir----\"\n\n\"Their problems are just exactly our problems,\" interrupted Emma\ncrisply.  \"They use garlic instead of onion, and they don't bathe as\noften as we do; but, then, perhaps we wouldn't either, if we hadn't\ntubs and showers so handy.\"\n\nIn the shop, queer things were happening to Gladys Orton-Wells. At her\nentrance into the big workroom, one hundred pairs of eyes had lifted,\ndropped, and, in that one look, condemned her hat, suit, blouse, veil\nand tout ensemble.  When you are on piece-work you squander very little\ntime gazing at uplift visitors in the wrong kind of clothes.\n\nGladys Orton-Wells looked about the big, bright workroom.  The noonday\nsun streamed in from a dozen great windows.  There seemed, somehow, to\nbe a look of content and capableness about those heads bent so busily\nover the stitching.\n\n\"It looks--pleasant,\" said Gladys Orton-Wells.\n\n\"It ain't bad.  Of course it's hard sitting all day.  But I'd rather do\nthat than stand from eight to six behind a counter. And there's good\nmoney in it.\"\n\nGladys Orton-Wells turned wistful eyes on friendly little Lily\nBernstein.\n\n\"I'd like to earn money,\" she said.  \"I'd like to work.\"\n\n\"Well, why don't you?\" demanded Lily.\n\n\"Work's all the style this year.  They're all doing it.  Look at the\nVanderbilts and that Morgan girl, and the whole crowd.  These days you\ncan't tell whether the girl at the machine next to you lives in the\nBronx or on Fifth Avenue.\"\n\n\"It must be wonderful to earn your own clothes.\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" laughed Lily Bernstein, \"it ain't so wonderful when\nyou've had to do it all your life.\"\n\nShe studied the pale girl before her with brows thoughtfully knit.\nLily had met too many uplifters to be in awe of them. Besides, a\ncertain warm-hearted friendliness was hers for every one she met.  So,\nlike the child she was, she spoke what was in her mind:\n\n\"Say, listen, dearie.  I wouldn't wear black if I was you.  And that\nplain stuff--it don't suit you.  I'm like that, too. There's some\nthings I can wear and others I look fierce in.  I'd like you in one of\nthem big flat hats and a full skirt like you see in the ads, with lots\nof ribbons and tag ends and bows on it. D'you know what I mean?\"\n\n\"My mother was a Van Cleve,\" said Gladys drearily, as though that\nexplained everything.  So it might have, to any but a Lily Bernstein.\n\nLily didn't know what a Van Cleve was, but she sensed it as a drawback.\n\n\"Don't you care.  Everybody's folks have got something the matter with\n'em.  Especially  when you're a girl.  But if I was you, I'd go right\nahead and do what I wanted to.\"\n\nIn the doorway at the far end of the shop appeared Emma with her two\nvisitors.  Mrs. Orton-Wells stopped and said something to a girl at a\nmachine, and her very posture and smile reeked of an offensive\nkindliness, a condescending patronage.\n\nGladys Orton-Wells did a strange thing.  She saw her mother coming\ntoward her.  She put one hand on Lily Bernstein's arm and she spoke\nhurriedly and in a little gasping voice.\n\n\"Listen!  Would you--would you marry a man who hadn't any money to\nspeak of, and no sort of family, if you loved him, even if your mother\nwouldn't--wouldn't----\"\n\n\"Would I!  Say, you go out to-morrow morning and buy yourself one of\nthem floppy hats and a lace waist over flesh-colored chiffon and get\nmarried in it.  Don't get it white, with your coloring.  Get it kind of\ncream.  You're so grand and thin, this year's things will look lovely\non you.\"\n\nA bell shrilled somewhere in the shop.  A hundred machines stopped\ntheir whirring.  A hundred heads came up with a sigh of relief.  Chairs\nwere pushed back, aprons unbuttoned.\n\nEmma McChesney Buck stepped forward and raised a hand for attention.\nThe noise of a hundred tongues was stilled.\n\n\"Girls, Miss Gladys Orton-Wells is going to speak to you for five\nminutes on the subject of dress.  Will you give her your attention,\nplease.  The five minutes will be added to your noon hour.\"\n\nGladys Orton-Wells looked down at her hands for one terrified moment,\nthen she threw her head up bravely.  There was no lack of color in her\ncheeks now.  She stepped to the middle of the room.\n\n\"What I have to say won't take five minutes,\" she said, in her clear,\nwell-bred tones.\n\n\"You all dress so smartly, and I'm such a dowd, I just want to ask you\nwhether you think I ought to get blue, or that new shade of gray for a\ntraveling-suit.\"\n\nAnd the shop, hardened to the eccentricities of noonday speakers, made\ncomposed and ready answer:\n\n\"Oh, get blue; it's always good.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" laughed Gladys Orton-Wells, and was off down the hall and\naway, with never a backward glance at her gasping and outraged mother.\n\nEmma McChesney Buck took Lily Bernstein's soft cheek between thumb and\nforefinger and pinched it ever so fondly.\n\n\"I knew you'd do it, Judy O'Grady,\" she said.\n\n\"Judy O'Who?\"\n\n\"O'Grady--a lady famous in history.\"\n\n\"Oh, now, quit your kiddin', Mrs. Buck!\" said Lily Bernstein.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nAN ETUDE FOR EMMA\n\nIf you listen long enough, and earnestly enough, and with ear\nsufficiently attuned to the music of this sphere there will come to you\nthis reward:  The violins and oboes and 'cellos and brasses of humanity\nwhich seemed all at variance with each other will unite as one\ninstrument; seeming discords and dissonances will blend into harmony,\nand the wail and blare and thrum of humanity's orchestra will sound in\nyour ear the sublime melody of that great symphony called Life.\n\nIn her sunny little private office on the twelfth floor of the great\nloft-building that housed the T. A. Buck Company, Emma McChesney Buck\nsat listening to the street-sounds that were wafted to her, mellowed by\nheight and distance.  The noises, taken separately, were the\nnerve-racking sounds common to a busy down-town New York cross-street.\nBy the time they reached the little office on the twelfth floor, they\nwere softened, mellowed, debrutalized, welded into a weird choirlike\nchant first high, then low, rising, swelling, dying away, rising again\nto a dull roar, with now and then vast undertones like the rumbling of\na cathedral pipe-organ.  Emma knew that the high, clear tenor note was\nthe shrill cry of the lame \"newsie\" at the corner of Sixth Avenue and\nTwenty-sixth Street.  Those deep, thunderous bass notes were the\ncombined reverberation of nearby \"L\" trains, distant subway and\nclanging surface cars.  That sharp staccato was a motorman clanging his\nbell of warning.  These things she knew.  But she liked, nevertheless,\nto shut her eyes for a moment in the midst of her busy day and listen\nto the chant of the city as it came up to her, subdued, softened,\nstrangely beautified. The sound saddened even while it filled her with\na certain exaltation.  We have no one word for that sensation.  The\nGerman (there's a language!) has it--Weltschmerz.\n\nAs distance softened the harsh sounds to her ears, so time and\nexperience had given her a perspective on life itself.  She saw it, not\nas a series of incidents, pleasant and unpleasant, but as a great\nuniversal scheme too mighty to comprehend--a scheme that always worked\nitself out in some miraculous way.\n\nShe had had a singularly full life, had Emma McChesney Buck.  A life\nreplete with work, leavened by sorrows, sweetened with happiness.\nThese ingredients make for tolerance.  She saw, for example, how the\ncapable, modern staff in the main business office had forged ahead of\nold Pop Henderson.  Pop Henderson had been head bookkeeper for years.\nBut the pen in his trembling hand made queer spidery marks in the\nledgers now, and his figure seven was very likely to look like a\ndrunken letter \"z.\"  The great bulk of his work was done by the\ncapable, comely Miss Kelly who could juggle figures like a Cinquevalli.\nHis shaking, blue-veined yellow hand was no match for Miss Kelly's\ncool, firm fingers.  But he stayed on at Buck's, and no one dreamed of\ninsulting him with talk of a pension, least of all Emma.  She saw the\nwork-worn pathetic old man not only as a figure but as a symbol.\n\nJock McChesney, very young, very handsome, very successful, coming on\nto New York from Chicago to be married in June, found his mother\nwrapped in this contemplative calm.  Now, Emma McChesney Buck, mother\nof an about-to-be-married son, was also surprisingly young and\nastonishingly handsome and highly successful.  Jock, in a lucid moment\nthe day before his wedding, took occasion to comment rather resentfully\non his mother's attitude.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" he said gloomily, \"that for a mother whose only son\nis about to be handed over to what the writers call the other woman,\nyou're pretty resigned, not to say cheerful.\"\n\nEmma glanced up at him as he stood there, so tall and straight and\naltogether good to look at, and the glow of love and pride in her eyes\nbelied the lightness of her words.\n\n\"I know it,\" she said, with mock seriousness, \"and it worries me.  I\ncan't imagine why I fail to feel those pangs that mothers are supposed\nto suffer at this time.  I ought to rend my garments and beat my\nbreast, but I can't help thinking of what a stunning girl Grace Galt\nis, and what a brain she has, and how lucky you are to get her.  Any\ngirl--with the future that girl had in the advertising field--who'll\ngive up four thousand a year and her independence to marry a man does\nit for love, let me tell you. If anybody knows you better than your\nmother, son, I'd hate to know who it is.  And if anybody loves you more\nthan your mother--well, we needn't go into that, because it would have\nto be hypothetical, anyway.  You see, Jock, I've loved you so long and\nso well that I know your faults as well as your virtues; and I love\nyou, not in spite of them but because of them.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" interrupted Jock, with some warmth, \"I'm not\nperfect, but a fellow----\"\n\n\"Perfect!  Jock McChesney, when I think of Grace's feelings when she\ndiscovers that you never close a closet door!  When I contemplate her\nemotions on hearing your howl at finding one seed in your orange juice\nat breakfast!  When she learns of your secret and unholy passion for\nneckties that have a dash of red in 'em, and how you have to be\nrestrained by force from----\"\n\nWith a simulated roar of rage, Jock McChesney fell upon his mother with\na series of bear-hugs that left her flushed, panting, limp, but\nbright-eyed.\n\nIt was to her husband that Emma revealed the real source of her Spartan\ncalm.  The wedding was over.  There had been a quiet little\ncelebration, after which Jock McChesney had gone West with his very\nlovely young wife. Emma had kissed her very tenderly, very soberly\nafter the brief ceremony.  \"Mrs. McChesney,\" she had said, and her\nvoice shook ever so little; \"Mrs. Jock McChesney!\"  And the new Mrs.\nMcChesney, a most astonishingly intuitive young woman indeed, had\nunderstood.\n\nT. A. Buck, being a man, puzzled over it a little.  That night, when\nEmma had reached the kimono and hair-brushing stage, he ventured to\nspeak his wonderment.\n\n\"D'you know, Emma, you were about the calmest and most serene mother\nthat I ever did see at a son's wedding.  Of course I didn't expect you\nto have hysterics, or anything like that.  I've always said that, when\nit came to repose and self-control, you could make the German Empress\nlook like a hoyden.  But I always thought that, at such times, a mother\nviewed her new daughter-in-law as a rival, that the very sight of her\nfilled her with a jealous rage like that of a tigress whose cub is\ntaken from her.  I must say you were so smiling and urbane that I\nthought it was almost uncomplimentary to the young couple.  You didn't\neven weep, you unnatural woman!\"\n\nEmma, seated before her dressing-table, stopped brushing her hair and\nsat silent a moment, looking down with unseeing eyes at the brush in\nher hand.\n\n\"I know it, T. A.  Would you like to have me tell you why?\"\n\nHe came over to her then and ran a tender hand down the length of her\nbright hair.  Then he kissed the top of her head.  This satisfactory\nperformance he capped by saying:\n\n\"I think I know why.  It's because the minister hesitated a minute and\nlooked from you to Grace and back again, not knowing which was the\nbride.  The way you looked in that dress, Emma, was enough to reconcile\nany woman to losing her entire family.\"\n\n\"T. A., you do say the nicest things to me.\"\n\n\"Like 'em, Emma?\"\n\n\"Like 'em?  You know perfectly well that you never can offend me by\nmaking me compliments like that.  I not only like them; I actually\nbelieve them!\"\n\n\"That's because I mean them, Emma.  Now, out with that reason!\"\n\nEmma stood up then and put her hands on his shoulders.  But she was not\nlooking at him.  She was gazing past him, her eyes dreamy,\ncontemplative.\n\n\"I don't know whether I'll be able to explain to you just how I feel\nabout it.  I'll probably make a mess of it.  But I'll try. You see,\ndear, it's just this way:  Two years ago--a year ago, even--I might\nhave felt just that sensation of personal resentment and loss.  But\nsomehow, lately, I've been looking at life through--how shall I put\nit?--through seven-league glasses. I used to see life in its relation\nto me and mine.  Now I see it in terms of my relation to it.  Do you\nget me?  I was the soloist, and the world my orchestral accompaniment.\nLately, I've been content just to step back with the other instruments\nand let my little share go to make up a more perfect whole.  In those\nyears, long before I met you, when Jock was all I had in the world, I\nworked and fought and saved that he might have the proper start, the\nproper training, and environment.  And I did succeed in giving him\nthose things.  Well, as I looked at him there to-day I saw him, not as\nmy son, my property that was going out of my control into the hands of\nanother woman, but as a link in the great chain that I had helped to\nforge--a link as strong and sound and perfect as I could make it.  I\nsaw him, not as my boy, Jock McChesney, but as a unit.  When I am gone\nI shall still live in him, and he in turn will live in his children.\nThere! I've muddled it--haven't I?--as I said I would.  But I think\"--\nAnd she looked into her husband's glowing eyes.--\"No; I'm sure you\nunderstand.  And when I die, T. A.----\"\n\n\"You, Emma!\"  And he held her close, and then held her off to look at\nher through quizzical, appreciative eyes.  \"Why, girl, I can't imagine\nyou doing anything so passive.\"\n\n\nIn the busy year that followed, anyone watching Emma McChesney Buck as\nshe worked and played and constructed, and helped others to work and\nplay and construct, would have agreed with T. A. Buck.  She did not\nseem a woman who was looking at life objectively.  As she went about\nher home in the evening, or the office, the workroom, or the showrooms\nduring the day, adjusting this, arranging that, smoothing out snarls,\nsolving problems of business or household, she was very much alive,\nvery vital, very personal, very electric.  In that year there came to\nher many letters from Jock and Grace--happy letters, all of them, some\nwith an undertone of great seriousness, as is fitting when two people\nare readjusting their lives.  Then, in spring, came the news of the\nbaby.  The telegram came to Emma as she sat in her office near the\nclose of a busy day.  As she read it and reread it, the slip of paper\nbecame a misty yellow with vague lines of blue dancing about on it;\nthen it became a blur of nothing in particular, as Emma's tears fell on\nit in a little shower of joy and pride and wonder at the eternal\nmiracle.\n\nThen she dried her eyes, mopped the telegram and her lace jabot\nimpartially, went across the hall and opened the door marked  \"T. A.\nBUCK.\"\n\nT. A. looked up from his desk, smiled, held out a hand.\n\n\"Girl or boy?\"\n\n\"Girl, of course,\" said Emma tremulously, \"and her name is Emma\nMcChesney.\"\n\nT. A. stood up and put an arm about his wife's shoulders.\n\n\"Lean on me, grandma,\" he said.\n\n\"Fiend!\" retorted Emma, and reread the telegram happily.  She folded it\nthen, with a pensive sigh, \"I hope she'll look like Grace.  But with\nJock's eyes.  They were wasted in a man.  At any rate, she ought to be\na raving, tearing beauty with that father and mother.\"\n\n\"What about her grandmother, when it comes to looks!  Yes, and think of\nthe brain she'll have,\" Buck reminded her excitedly. \"Great Scott!\nWith a grandmother who has made the T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat a\nhousehold word, and a mother who was the cleverest woman advertising\ncopy-writer in New York, this young lady ought to be a composite Hetty\nGreen, Madame de Stael, Hypatia, and Emma McChesney Buck.  She'll be a\nlady wizard of finance or a----\"\n\n\"She'll be nothing of the kind,\" Emma disputed calmly.  \"That child\nwill be a throwback.  The third generation generally is. With a\nmilitant mother and a grandmother such as that child has, she'll just\nnaturally be a clinging vine.  She'll be a reversion to type.  She'll\nbe the kind who'll make eyes and wear pale blue and be crazy about new\nembroidery-stitches.  Just mark my words, T. A.\"\n\nBuck had a brilliant idea.\n\n\"Why don't you pack a bag and run over to Chicago for a few days and\nsee this marvel of the age?\"\n\nBut Emma shook her head.\n\n\"Not now, T. A.  Later.  Let the delicate machinery of that new\nhousehold adjust itself and begin to run smoothly and sweetly again.\nAnyone who might come in now--even Jock's mother--would be only an\noutsider.\"\n\nSo she waited very patiently and considerately.  There was much to\noccupy her mind that spring.  Business was unexpectedly and\ngratifyingly good.  Then, too, one of their pet dreams was being\nrealized; they were to have their own house in the country, at\nWestchester.  Together they had pored over the plans.  It was to be a\nhouse of wide, spacious verandas, of fireplaces, of bookshelves, of\ngreat, bright windows, and white enamel and cheerful chintz.  By the\nend of May it was finished, furnished, and complete.  At which a\nsurprising thing happened; and yet, not so surprising.  A demon of\nrestlessness seized Emma McChesney Buck.  It had been a busy, happy\nwinter, filled with work.  Now that it was finished, there came upon\nEmma and Buck that unconscious and quite natural irritation which\nfollows a long winter spent together by two people, no matter how much\nin harmony.  Emma pulled herself up now and then, horrified to find a\nrasping note of impatience in her voice.  Buck found himself, once or\ntwice, fairly caught in a little whirlpool of ill temper of his own\nmaking.  These conditions they discovered almost simultaneously.  And\nlike the comrades they were, they talked it over and came to a sensible\nunderstanding.\n\n\"We're a bit ragged and saw-edged,\" said Emma.  \"We're getting on each\nother's nerves.  What we need is a vacation from each other.  This\nmorning I found myself on the verge of snapping at you.  At you!\nImagine, T. A.!\"\n\nWhereupon Buck came forward with his confession.\n\n\"It's a couple of late cases of spring fever.  You've been tied to this\noffice all winter.  So've I.  We need a change.  You've had too much\npetticoats, too much husband, too much cutting room and sales-room and\nrush orders and business generally.  Too much Featherloom and not\nenough foolishness.\"  He came over and put a gentle hand on his wife's\nshoulder, a thing strictly against the rules during business hours.\nAnd Emma not only permitted it but reached over and covered his hand\nwith her own.  \"You're tired, and you're a wee bit nervous; so g'wan,\"\nsaid T. A., ever so gently, and kissed his wife, \"g'wan; get out of\nhere!\"\n\nAnd Emma got.\n\nShe went, not to the mountains or the seashore but with her face to the\nwest.  In her trunks were tiny garments--garments pink-ribboned,\nblue-ribboned, things embroidered and scalloped and hemstitched and\nhand-made and lacy.  She went looking less grandmotherly than ever in\nher smart, blue tailor suit, her rakish hat, her quietly correct\ngloves, and slim shoes and softly becoming jabot.  Her husband had got\nher a compartment, had laden her down with books, magazines, fruit,\nflowers, candy.  Five minutes before the train pulled out, Emma looked\nabout the little room and sighed, even while she smiled.\n\n\"You're an extravagant boy, T. A. I look as if I were equipped for a\ndash to the pole instead of an eighteen-hour run to Chicago.  But I\nlove you for it.  I suppose I ought to be ashamed to confess how I like\nhaving a whole compartment just for myself. You see, a compartment\nalways will spell luxury to me.  There were all those years on the\nroad, you know, when I often considered myself in luck to get an upper\non a local of a branch line that threw you around in your berth like a\nbean in a tin can every time the engineer stopped or started.\"\n\nBuck looked at his watch, then stooped in farewell.  Quite suddenly\nthey did not want to part.  They had grown curiously used to each\nother, these two.  Emma found herself clinging to this man with the\ntender eyes, and Buck held her close, regardless of train-schedules.\nEmma rushed him to the platform and watched him, wide-eyed, as he swung\noff the slowly moving train.\n\n\"Come on along!\" she called, almost tearfully.\n\nBuck looked up at her.  At her trim, erect figure, at her clear\nyouthful coloring, at the brightness of her eye.\n\n\"If you want to get a reputation for comedy,\" he laughed, \"tell\nsomebody on that train that you're going to visit your granddaughter.\"\n\nJock met her at the station in Chicago and drove her home in a very\ndapper and glittering black runabout.\n\n\"Grace wanted to come down,\" he explained, as they sped along, \"but\nthey're changing the baby's food or something, and she didn't want to\nleave.  You know those nurses.\"  Emma felt a curious little pang.  This\nwas her boy, her baby, talking about his baby and nurses.  She had a\nsense of unreality.  He turned to her with shining eyes.  \"That's a\nstunning get-up, Blonde. Honestly, you're a wiz, mother. Grace has told\nall her friends that you're coming, and their mothers are going to\ncall.  But, good Lord, you look like my younger sister, on the square\nyou do!\"\n\nThe apartment reached, it seemed to Emma that she floated across the\nwalk and up the stairs, so eagerly did her heart cry out for a glimpse\nof this little being who was flesh of her flesh. Grace, a little pale\nbut more beautiful than ever, met them at the door.  Her arms went\nabout Emma's neck.  Then she stood her handsome mother-in-law off and\ngazed at her.\n\n\"You wonder!  How lovely you look!  Good heavens, are they wearing that\nkind of hat in New York!  And those collars!  I haven't seen a thing\nlike 'em here.  'East is east and West is west and----'\"\n\n\"Where's that child?\" demanded Emma McChesney Buck.  \"Where's my baby?\"\n\n\"Sh-sh-sh-sh!\" came in a sibilant duet from Grace and Jock. \"Not now.\nShe's sleeping.  We were up with her for three hours last night.  It\nwas the new food.  She's not used to it yet.\"\n\n\"But, you foolish children, can't I peek at her?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no!\" said Grace hastily.  \"We never go into her room when\nshe's asleep.  This is your room, mother dear.  And just as soon as she\nwakes up--this is your bath--you'll want to freshen up.  Dear me; who\ncould have hung the baby's little shirt here?  The nurse, I suppose.\nIf I don't attend to every little thing----\"\n\nEmma took off her hat and smoothed her hair with light, deft fingers.\nShe turned a smiling face toward Jock and Grace standing there in the\ndoorway.\n\n\"Now don't bother, dear.  If you knew how I love having that little\nshirt to look at!  And I've such things in my trunk!  Wait till you see\nthem.\"\n\nSo she possessed her soul in patience for one hour, two hours. At the\nend of the second hour, a little wail went up.  Grace vanished down the\nhall.  Emma, her heart beating very fast, followed her.  A moment later\nshe was bending over a very pink morsel with very blue eyes and she was\nsaying, over and over in a rapture of delightful idiocy:\n\n\"Say hello to your gran-muzzer, yes her is!  Say, hello, granny!\"  And\nher longing arms reached down to take up her namesake.\n\n\"Not now!\" Grace said hastily.  \"We never play with her just before\nfeeding-time.  We find that it excites her, and that's bad for her\ndigestion.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" marveled Emma.  \"I don't remember worrying about Jock's\ndigestion when he was two and a half months old!\"\n\nIt was thus that Emma McChesney Buck, for many years accustomed to\nleadership, learned to follow humbly and in silence.  She had always\nbeen the orbit about which her world revolved.  Years of brilliant\nsuccess, of triumphant execution, had not spoiled her, or made her\noffensively dictatorial.  But they had taught her a certain\nself-confidence; had accustomed her to a degree of deference from\nothers.  Now she was the humblest of the satellites revolving about\nthis sun of the household.  She learned to tiptoe when small Emma\nMcChesney was sleeping.  She learned that the modern mother does not\napprove of the holding of a child in one's arms, no matter how those\narms might be aching to feel the frail weight of the soft, sweet body.\nShe who had brought a child into the world, who had had to train that\nchild alone, had raised him single-handed, had educated him, denied\nherself for him, made a man of him, now found herself all ignorant of\ntwentieth century child-raising methods.  She learned strange things\nabout barley-water and formulae and units and olive oil, and orange\njuice and ounces and farina, and bath-thermometers and blue-and-white\nstriped nurses who view grandmothers with a coldly disapproving and\npitying eye.\n\nShe watched the bathing-process for the first time with wonder as frank\nas it was unfeigned.\n\n\"And I thought I was a modern woman!\" she marveled.  \"When I used to\nbathe Jock I tested the temperature of the water with my elbow; and I\nknow my mother used to test my bath-water when I was a baby by putting\nme into it.  She used to say that if I turned blue she knew the water\nwas too cold, and if I turned red she knew it was too hot.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" snorted the blue-and-white striped nurse, and rightly.\n\n\"Oh, I don't say that your method isn't the proper one,\" Emma hastened\nto say humbly, and watched Grace scrutinize the bath-thermometer with\ncritical eye.\n\nIn the days that followed, there came calling the mothers of Grace's\nyoung-women friends, as Jock had predicted.  Charming elderly women,\nmost of them, all of them gracious and friendly with that generous\nfriendliness which is of the West.  But each fell into one of two\nclasses--the placid, black-silk, rather vague woman of middle age,\nwhose face has the blank look of the sheltered woman and who wrinkles\nearly from sheer lack of sufficient activity or vital interest in life;\nand the wiry, well-dressed, assertive type who talked about her club\nwork and her charities, her voice always taking the rising inflection\nat the end of a sentence, as though addressing a meeting.  When they\nmet Emma, it was always with a little startled look of surprise,\nfollowed by something that bordered on disapproval.  Emma, the keenly\nobservant, watching them, felt vaguely uncomfortable.  She tried to be\npolitely interested in what they had to say, but she found her thoughts\nstraying a thousand miles away to the man whom she loved and who loved\nher, to the big, busy factory with its humming machinery and its\ncapable office staff, to the tasteful, comfortable, spacious house that\nshe had helped to plan; to all the vital absorbing, fascinating and\nconstructive interests with which her busy New York life was filled to\noverflowing.\n\nSo she looked smilingly at the plump, gray-haired ladies who came\na-calling in their smart black with the softening lace-effect at the\nthroat, and they looked, smiling politely, too, at this slim, erect,\npink-cheeked, bright-eyed woman with the shining golden hair and the\nfirm, smooth skin, and the alert manner; and in their eyes was that\ndistrust which lurks in the eyes of a woman as she looks at another\nwoman of her own age who doesn't show it.\n\nIn the weeks of her stay, Emma managed, little by little, to take the\nplace of second mother in the household.  She had tact and finesse and\ncleverness enough even for that herculean feat. Grace's pale cheeks and\nlast year's wardrobe made her firm in her stand.\n\n\"Grace,\" she said, one day, \"listen to me:  I want you to get some\nclothes--a lot of them, and foolish ones, all of them. Babies are all\nvery well, but husbands have some slight right to consideration.  The\nclock, for you, is an instrument devised to cut up the day and night\ninto your baby's eating- and sleeping-periods.  I want you to get some\nfloppy hats with roses on 'em, and dresses with ruffles and sashes.\nI'll stay home and guard your child from vandals and ogres.  Scat!\"\n\nHer stay lengthened to four weeks, five weeks, six.  She had the\nsatisfaction of seeing the roses blooming in Grace's cheeks as well as\nin her hats.  She learned to efface her own personality that others\nmight shine who had a better right.  And she lost some of her own\nbright color, a measure of her own buoyancy.  In the sixth week she\nsaw, in her mirror, something that caused her to lean forward, to stare\nfor one intent moment, then to shrink back, wide-eyed.  A little\nsunburst, hair-fine but undeniable, was etched delicately about the\ncorners of her eyes.  Fifteen minutes later, she had wired New York\nthus:\n\n     Home Friday.  Do you still love me?  EMMA.\n\n\nWhen she left, little Emma McChesney was sleeping, by a curious\ncoincidence, as she had been when Emma arrived, so that she could not\nhave the satisfaction of a last pressure of the lips against the\nrose-petal cheek.  She had to content herself with listening close to\nthe door in the vain hope of catching a last sound of the child's\nbreathing.\n\nShe was laden with fruits and flowers and magazines on her departure,\nas she had been when she left New York.  But, somehow, these things did\nnot seem to interest her.  After the train had left Chicago's smoky\nbuildings far behind, she sat very still for a long time, her eyes\nshut.  She told herself that she felt and looked very old, very tired,\nvery unlike the Emma McChesney Buck who had left New York a few weeks\nbefore.  Then she thought of T. A., and her eyes unclosed and she\nsmiled.  By the time the train had reached Cleveland the little lines\nseemed miraculously to have disappeared, somehow, from about her eyes.\nWhen they left the One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street station she was\na creature transformed.  And when the train rolled into the great\ndown-town shed, Emma was herself again, bright-eyed, alert, vibrating\nenergy.\n\nThere was no searching, no hesitation.  Her eyes met his, and his eyes\nfound hers with a quite natural magnetism.\n\n\"Oh, T. A., my dear, my dear!  I didn't know you were so handsome!  And\nhow beautiful New York is!  Tell me:  Have I grown old?  Have I?\"\n\nT. A. bundled her into a taxi and gazed at her in some alarm.\n\n\"You!  Old!  What put that nonsense into your head?  You're tired,\ndear.  We'll go home, and you'll have a good rest, and a quiet\nevening----\"\n\n\"Rest!\" echoed Emma, and sat up very straight, her cheeks pink. \"Quiet\nevening!  T. A. Buck, listen to me.  I've had nothing but rest and\nquiet evenings for six weeks.  I feel a million years old.  One more\nday of being a grandmother and I should have died! Do you know what I'm\ngoing to do?  I'm going to stop at Fifth Avenue this minute and buy a\nhat that's a thousand times too young for me, and you're going with me\nto tell me that it isn't. And then you'll take me somewhere to\ndinner--a place with music and pink shades.  And then I want to see a\nwicked play, preferably with a runway through the center aisle for the\nchorus.\n\nAnd then I want to go somewhere and dance!  Get that, dear? Dance!\nTell me, T. A.--tell me the truth:  Do you think I'm old, and faded,\nand wistful and grandmotherly?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said T. A. Buck, \"that you're the most beautiful, the most\nwonderful, the most adorable woman in the world, and the more foolish\nyour new hat is and the later we dance the better I'll like it.  It has\nbeen awful without you, Emma.\"\n\nEmma closed her eyes and there came from the depths of her heart a\ngreat sigh of relief, and comfort and gratification.\n\n\"Oh, T. A., my dear, it's all very well to drown your identity in the\nmusic of the orchestra, but there's nothing equal to the soul-filling\nsatisfaction that you get in solo work.\"",
