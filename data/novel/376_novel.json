Written by a Citizen who continued all the while in\nLondon. Never made public before\n\n\nIt was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among the rest of\nmy neighbours, heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned\nagain in Holland; for it had been very violent there, and particularly\nat Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, whither, they say, it was\nbrought, some said from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods\nwhich were brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was\nbrought from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it\ncame; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.\n\nWe had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread\nrumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the invention of\nmen, as I have lived to see practised since. But such things as these\nwere gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded\nabroad, and from them was handed about by word of mouth only; so that\nthings did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now.\nBut it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several\ncouncils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was\nkept very private. Hence it was that this rumour died off again, and\npeople began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in,\nand that we hoped was not true; till the latter end of November or the\nbeginning of December 1664 when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of\nthe plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The\nfamily they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but\nas it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the\nSecretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning themselves to\ninquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians\nand a surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make inspection. This\nthey did; and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the\nbodies that were dead, they gave their opinions publicly that they died\nof the plague. Whereupon it was given in to the parish clerk, and he\nalso returned them to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly bill of\nmortality in the usual manner, thus--\n\n\nPlague, 2. Parishes infected, 1.\n\nThe people showed a great concern at this, and began to be alarmed all\nover the town, and the more, because in the last week in December 1664\nanother man died in the same house, and of the same distemper. And then\nwe were easy again for about six weeks, when none having died with any\nmarks of infection, it was said the distemper was gone; but after that,\nI think it was about the 12th of February, another died in another\nhouse, but in the same parish and in the same manner.\n\nThis turned the people's eyes pretty much towards that end of the town,\nand the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in St Giles's parish\nmore than usual, it began to be suspected that the plague was among the\npeople at that end of the town, and that many had died of it, though\nthey had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the public\nas possible. This possessed the heads of the people very much, and few\ncared to go through Drury Lane, or the other streets suspected, unless\nthey had extraordinary business that obliged them to it\n\nThis increase of the bills stood thus: the usual number of burials in a\nweek, in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields and St Andrew's,\nHolborn, were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each, few more or\nless; but from the time that the plague first began in St Giles's\nparish, it was observed that the ordinary burials increased in number\nconsiderably. For example:--\n\n\n     From December 27 to January 3  { St Giles's      16\n     \"                              { St Andrew's     17\n\n     \"     January 3  \"    \"    10  { St Giles's      12\n     \"                              { St Andrew's     25\n\n     \"     January 10 \"    \"    17  { St Giles's      18\n     \"                              { St Andrew's     28\n\n     \"     January 17 \"    \"    24  { St Giles's      23\n     \"                              { St Andrew's     16\n\n     \"     January 24 \"    \"    31  { St Giles's      24\n     \"                              { St Andrew's     15\n\n     \"     January 30 \" February 7  { St Giles's      21\n     \"                              { St Andrew's     23\n\n     \"     February 7 \"     \"   14  { St Giles's      24\n\nThe like increase of the bills was observed in the parishes of St\nBride's, adjoining on one side of Holborn parish, and in the parish of\nSt James, Clerkenwell, adjoining on the other side of Holborn; in both\nwhich parishes the usual numbers that died weekly were from four to six\nor eight, whereas at that time they were increased as follows:--\n\n\n     From December 20 to December 27  { St Bride's     0\n     \"                                { St James's     8\n\n     \"    December 27 to January   3  { St Bride's     6\n     \"                                { St James's     9\n\n     \"    January  3  \"    \"      10  { St Bride's    11\n     \"                                { St James's     7\n\n     \"    January 10  \"    \"      17  { St Bride's    12\n     \"                                { St James's     9\n\n     \"    January 17  \"    \"      24  { St Bride's     9\n     \"                                { St James's    15\n\n     \"    January 24  \"    \"      31  { St Bride's     8\n     \"                                { St James's    12\n\n     \"    January 31  \" February   7  { St Bride's    13\n     \"                                { St James's     5\n\n     \"    February 7  \"    \"      14  { St Bride's     12\n     \"                                { St James's     6\n\nBesides this, it was observed with great uneasiness by the people that\nthe weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks,\nalthough it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very\nmoderate.\n\nThe usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was\nfrom about 240 or thereabouts to 300. The last was esteemed a pretty\nhigh bill; but after this we found the bills successively increasing as\nfollows:--\n\n\n     Buried.  Increased.\n     December the 20th to the 27th               291       ...\n     \"     \"      27th  \"     3rd January        349        58\n     January  the  3rd  \"    10th   \"            394        45\n     \"     \"      10th  \"    17th   \"            415        21\n     \"     \"      17th  \"    24th   \"            474        59\n\nThis last bill was really frightful, being a higher number than had been\nknown to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of\n1656.\n\nHowever, all this went off again, and the weather proving cold, and the\nfrost, which began in December, still continuing very severe even till\nnear the end of February, attended with sharp though moderate winds, the\nbills decreased again, and the city grew healthy, and everybody began to\nlook upon the danger as good as over; only that still the burials in St\nGiles's continued high. From the beginning of April especially they\nstood at twenty-five each week, till the week from the 18th to the 25th,\nwhen there was buried in St Giles's parish thirty, whereof two of the\nplague and eight of the spotted-fever, which was looked upon as the same\nthing; likewise the number that died of the spotted-fever in the whole\nincreased, being eight the week before, and twelve the week above-named.\n\nThis alarmed us all again, and terrible apprehensions were among the\npeople, especially the weather being now changed and growing warm, and\nthe summer being at hand. However, the next week there seemed to be some\nhopes again; the bills were low, the number of the dead in all was but\n388, there was none of the plague, and but four of the spotted-fever.\n\nBut the following week it returned again, and the distemper was spread\ninto two or three other parishes, viz., St Andrew's, Holborn; St Clement\nDanes; and, to the great affliction of the city, one died within the\nwalls, in the parish of St Mary Woolchurch, that is to say, in\nBearbinder Lane, near Stocks Market; in all there were nine of the\nplague and six of the spotted-fever. It was, however, upon inquiry found\nthat this Frenchman who died in Bearbinder Lane was one who, having\nlived in Long Acre, near the infected houses, had removed for fear of\nthe distemper, not knowing that he was already infected.\n\nThis was the beginning of May, yet the weather was temperate, variable,\nand cool enough, and people had still some hopes. That which encouraged\nthem was that the city was healthy: the whole ninety-seven parishes\nburied but fifty-four, and we began to hope that, as it was chiefly\namong the people at that end of the town, it might go no farther; and\nthe rather, because the next week, which was from the 9th of May to the\n16th, there died but three, of which not one within the whole city or\nliberties; and St Andrew's buried but fifteen, which was very low. 'Tis\ntrue St Giles's buried two-and-thirty, but still, as there was but one\nof the plague, people began to be easy. The whole bill also was very\nlow, for the week before the bill was but 347, and the week above\nmentioned but 343. We continued in these hopes for a few days, but it\nwas but for a few, for the people were no more to be deceived thus; they\nsearched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every\nway, and that many died of it every day. So that now all our\nextenuations abated, and it was no more to be concealed; nay, it quickly\nappeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of\nabatement. That in the parish of St Giles it was gotten into several\nstreets, and several families lay all sick together; and, accordingly,\nin the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself.\nThere was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague, but this was all\nknavery and collusion, for in St Giles's parish they buried forty in\nall, whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague, though they\nwere set down of other distempers; and though the number of all the\nburials were not increased above thirty-two, and the whole bill being\nbut 385, yet there was fourteen of the spotted-fever, as well as\nfourteen of the plague; and we took it for granted upon the whole that\nthere were fifty died that week of the plague.\n\nThe next bill was from the 23rd of May to the 30th, when the number of\nthe plague was seventeen. But the burials in St Giles's were fifty-\nthree--a frightful number!--of whom they set down but nine of the\nplague; but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace,\nand at the Lord Mayor's request, it was found there were twenty more who\nwere really dead of the plague in that parish, but had been set down of\nthe spotted-fever or other distempers, besides others concealed.\n\nBut those were trifling things to what followed immediately after; for\nnow the weather set in hot, and from the first week in June the\ninfection spread in a dreadful manner, and the bills rose high; the\narticles of the fever, spotted-fever, and teeth began to swell; for all\nthat could conceal their distempers did it, to prevent their neighbours\nshunning and refusing to converse with them, and also to prevent\nauthority shutting up their houses; which, though it was not yet\npractised, yet was threatened, and people were extremely terrified at\nthe thoughts of it.\n\nThe second week in June, the parish of St Giles, where still the weight\nof the infection lay, buried 120, whereof though the bills said but\nsixty-eight of the plague, everybody said there had been 100 at least,\ncalculating it from the usual number of funerals in that parish, as\nabove.\n\nTill this week the city continued free, there having never any died,\nexcept that one Frenchman whom I mentioned before, within the whole\nninety-seven parishes. Now there died four within the city, one in Wood\nStreet, one in Fenchurch Street, and two in Crooked Lane. Southwark was\nentirely free, having not one yet died on that side of the water.\n\nI lived without Aldgate, about midway between Aldgate Church and\nWhitechappel Bars, on the left hand or north side of the street; and as\nthe distemper had not reached to that side of the city, our\nneighbourhood continued very easy. But at the other end of the town\ntheir consternation was very great: and the richer sort of people,\nespecially the nobility and gentry from the west part of the city,\nthronged out of town with their families and servants in an unusual\nmanner; and this was more particularly seen in Whitechappel; that is to\nsay, the Broad Street where I lived; indeed, nothing was to be seen but\nwaggons and carts, with goods, women, servants, children, &c.; coaches\nfilled with people of the better sort and horsemen attending them, and\nall hurrying away; then empty waggons and carts appeared, and spare\nhorses with servants, who, it was apparent, were returning or sent from\nthe countries to fetch more people; besides innumerable numbers of men\non horseback, some alone, others with servants, and, generally speaking,\nall loaded with baggage and fitted out for travelling, as anyone might\nperceive by their appearance.\n\nThis was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see, and as it was a\nsight which I could not but look on from morning to night (for indeed\nthere was nothing else of moment to be seen), it filled me with very\nserious thoughts of the misery that was coming upon the city, and the\nunhappy condition of those that would be left in it.\n\nThis hurry of the people was such for some weeks that there was no\ngetting at the Lord Mayor's door without exceeding difficulty; there\nwere such pressing and crowding there to get passes and certificates of\nhealth for such as travelled abroad, for without these there was no\nbeing admitted to pass through the towns upon the road, or to lodge in\nany inn. Now, as there had none died in the city for all this time, my\nLord Mayor gave certificates of health without any difficulty to all\nthose who lived in the ninety-seven parishes, and to those within the\nliberties too for a while.\n\nThis hurry, I say, continued some weeks, that is to say, all the month\nof May and June, and the more because it was rumoured that an order of\nthe Government was to be issued out to place turnpikes and barriers on\nthe road to prevent people travelling, and that the towns on the road\nwould not suffer people from London to pass for fear of bringing the\ninfection along with them, though neither of these rumours had any\nfoundation but in the imagination, especially at-first.\n\nI now began to consider seriously with myself concerning my own case,\nand how I should dispose of myself; that is to say, whether I should\nresolve to stay in London or shut up my house and flee, as many of my\nneighbours did. I have set this particular down so fully, because I know\nnot but it may be of moment to those who come after me, if they come to\nbe brought to the same distress, and to the same manner of making their\nchoice; and therefore I desire this account may pass with them rather\nfor a direction to themselves to act by than a history of my actings,\nseeing it may not be of one farthing value to them to note what became\nof me.\n\nI had two important things before me: the one was the carrying on my\nbusiness and shop, which was considerable, and in which was embarked all\nmy effects in the world; and the other was the preservation of my life\nin so dismal a calamity as I saw apparently was coming upon the whole\ncity, and which, however great it was, my fears perhaps, as well as\nother people's, represented to be much greater than it could be.\n\nThe first consideration was of great moment to me; my trade was a\nsaddler, and as my dealings were chiefly not by a shop or chance trade,\nbut among the merchants trading to the English colonies in America, so\nmy effects lay very much in the hands of such. I was a single man, 'tis\ntrue, but I had a family of servants whom I kept at my business; had a\nhouse, shop, and warehouses filled with goods; and, in short, to leave\nthem all as things in such a case must be left (that is to say, without\nany overseer or person fit to be trusted with them), had been to hazard\nthe loss not only of my trade, but of my goods, and indeed of all I had\nin the world.\n\nI had an elder brother at the same time in London, and not many years\nbefore come over from Portugal: and advising with him, his answer was in\nthree words, the same that was given in another case quite different,\nviz., 'Master, save thyself.' In a word, he was for my retiring into the\ncountry, as he resolved to do himself with his family; telling me what\nhe had, it seems, heard abroad, that the best preparation for the plague\nwas to run away from it. As to my argument of losing my trade, my goods,\nor debts, he quite confuted me. He told me the same thing which I argued\nfor my staying, viz., that I would trust God with my safety and health,\nwas the strongest repulse to my pretensions of losing my trade and my\ngoods; 'for', says he, 'is it not as reasonable that you should trust\nGod with the chance or risk of losing your trade, as that you should\nstay in so eminent a point of danger, and trust Him with your life?'\n\nI could not argue that I was in any strait as to a place where to go,\nhaving several friends and relations in Northamptonshire, whence our\nfamily first came from; and particularly, I had an only sister in\nLincolnshire, very willing to receive and entertain me.\n\nMy brother, who had already sent his wife and two children into\nBedfordshire, and resolved to follow them, pressed my going very\nearnestly; and I had once resolved to comply with his desires, but at\nthat time could get no horse; for though it is true all the people did\nnot go out of the city of London, yet I may venture to say that in a\nmanner all the horses did; for there was hardly a horse to be bought or\nhired in the whole city for some weeks. Once I resolved to travel on\nfoot with one servant, and, as many did, lie at no inn, but carry a\nsoldier's tent with us, and so lie in the fields, the weather being very\nwarm, and no danger from taking cold. I say, as many did, because\nseveral did so at last, especially those who had been in the armies in\nthe war which had not been many years past; and I must needs say that,\nspeaking of second causes, had most of the people that travelled done\nso, the plague had not been carried into so many country towns and\nhouses as it was, to the great damage, and indeed to the ruin, of\nabundance of people.\n\nBut then my servant, whom I had intended to take down with me, deceived\nme; and being frighted at the increase of the distemper, and not knowing\nwhen I should go, he took other measures, and left me, so I was put off\nfor that time; and, one way or other, I always found that to appoint to\ngo away was always crossed by some accident or other, so as to\ndisappoint and put it off again; and this brings in a story which\notherwise might be thought a needless digression, viz., about these\ndisappointments being from Heaven.\n\nI mention this story also as the best method I can advise any person to\ntake in such a case, especially if he be one that makes conscience of\nhis duty, and would be directed what to do in it, namely, that he should\nkeep his eye upon the particular providences which occur at that time,\nand look upon them complexly, as they regard one another, and as all\ntogether regard the question before him: and then, I think, he may\nsafely take them for intimations from Heaven of what is his unquestioned\nduty to do in such a case; I mean as to going away from or staying in\nthe place where we dwell, when visited with an infectious distemper.\n\nIt came very warmly into my mind one morning, as I was musing on this\nparticular thing, that as nothing attended us without the direction or\npermission of Divine Power, so these disappointments must have something\nin them extraordinary; and I ought to consider whether it did not\nevidently point out, or intimate to me, that it was the will of Heaven I\nshould not go. It immediately followed in my thoughts, that if it really\nwas from God that I should stay, He was able effectually to preserve me\nin the midst of all the death and danger that would surround me; and\nthat if I attempted to secure myself by fleeing from my habitation, and\nacted contrary to these intimations, which I believe to be Divine, it\nwas a kind of flying from God, and that He could cause His justice to\novertake me when and where He thought fit.\n\nThese thoughts quite turned my resolutions again, and when I came to\ndiscourse with my brother again I told him that I inclined to stay and\ntake my lot in that station in which God had placed me, and that it\nseemed to be made more especially my duty, on the account of what I have\nsaid.\n\nMy brother, though a very religious man himself, laughed at all I had\nsuggested about its being an intimation from Heaven, and told me several\nstories of such foolhardy people, as he called them, as I was; that I\nought indeed to submit to it as a work of Heaven if I had been any way\ndisabled by distempers or diseases, and that then not being able to go,\nI ought to acquiesce in the direction of Him, who, having been my Maker,\nhad an undisputed right of sovereignty in disposing of me, and that then\nthere had been no difficulty to determine which was the call of His\nprovidence and which was not; but that I should take it as an intimation\nfrom Heaven that I should not go out of town, only because I could not\nhire a horse to go, or my fellow was run away that was to attend me, was\nridiculous, since at the time I had my health and limbs, and other\nservants, and might with ease travel a day or two on foot, and having a\ngood certificate of being in perfect health, might either hire a horse\nor take post on the road, as I thought fit.\n\nThen he proceeded to tell me of the mischievous consequences which\nattended the presumption of the Turks and Mahometans in Asia and in\nother places where he had been (for my brother, being a merchant, was a\nfew years before, as I have already observed, returned from abroad,\ncoming last from Lisbon), and how, presuming upon their professed\npredestinating notions, and of every man's end being predetermined and\nunalterably beforehand decreed, they would go unconcerned into infected\nplaces and converse with infected persons, by which means they died at\nthe rate of ten or fifteen thousand a week, whereas the Europeans or\nChristian merchants, who kept themselves retired and reserved, generally\nescaped the contagion.\n\nUpon these arguments my brother changed my resolutions again, and I\nbegan to resolve to go, and accordingly made all things ready; for, in\nshort, the infection increased round me, and the bills were risen to\nalmost seven hundred a week, and my brother told me he would venture to\nstay no longer. I desired him to let me consider of it but till the next\nday, and I would resolve: and as I had already prepared everything as\nwell as I could as to MY business, and whom to entrust my affairs with,\nI had little to do but to resolve.\n\nI went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind, irresolute, and\nnot knowing what to do. I had set the evening wholly--apart to consider\nseriously about it, and was all alone; for already people had, as it\nwere by a general consent, taken up the custom of not going out of doors\nafter sunset; the reasons I shall have occasion to say more of by-and-\nby.\n\nIn the retirement of this evening I endeavoured to resolve, first, what\nwas my duty to do, and I stated the arguments with which my brother had\npressed me to go into the country, and I set, against them the strong\nimpressions which I had on my mind for staying; the visible call I\nseemed to have from the particular circumstance of my calling, and the\ncare due from me for the preservation of my effects, which were, as I\nmight say, my estate; also the intimations which I thought I had from\nHeaven, that to me signified a kind of direction to venture; and it\noccurred to me that if I had what I might call a direction to stay, I\nought to suppose it contained a promise of being preserved if I obeyed.\n\nThis lay close to me, and my mind seemed more and more encouraged to\nstay than ever, and supported with a secret satisfaction that I should\nbe kept. Add to this, that, turning over the Bible which lay before me,\nand while my thoughts were more than ordinarily serious upon the\nquestion, I cried out, 'Well, I know not what to do; Lord, direct me !'\nand the like; and at that juncture I happened to stop turning over the\nbook at the ninety-first Psalm, and casting my eye on the second verse, I read\non to the seventh verse exclusive, and after that included the tenth, as\nfollows: 'I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my\nGod, in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of\nthe fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with\nHis feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be\nthy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by\nnight; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that\nwalketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A\nthousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but\nit shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and\nsee the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is\nmy refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil\nbefall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling,' &C.\n\nI scarce need tell the reader that from that moment I resolved that I\nwould stay in the town, and casting myself entirely upon the goodness\nand protection of the Almighty, would not seek any other shelter\nwhatever; and that, as my times were in His hands, He was as able to\nkeep me in a time of the infection as in a time of health; and if He did\nnot think fit to deliver me, still I was in His hands, and it was meet\nHe should do with me as should seem good to Him.\n\nWith this resolution I went to bed; and I was further confirmed in it\nthe next day by the woman being taken ill with whom I had intended to\nentrust my house and all my affairs. But I had a further obligation laid\non me on the same side, for the next day I found myself very much out of\norder also, so that if I would have gone away, I could not, and I\ncontinued ill three or four days, and this entirely determined my stay;\nso I took my leave of my brother, who went away to Dorking, in Surrey,\nand afterwards fetched a round farther into Buckinghamshire or\nBedfordshire, to a retreat he had found out there for his family.\n\nIt was a very ill time to be sick in, for if any one complained, it was\nimmediately said he had the plague; and though I had indeed no symptom\nof that distemper, yet being very ill, both in my head and in my\nstomach, I was not without apprehension that I really was infected; but\nin about three days I grew better; the third night I rested well,\nsweated a little, and was much refreshed. The apprehensions of its being\nthe infection went also quite away with my illness, and I went about my\nbusiness as usual.\n\nThese things, however, put off all my thoughts of going into the\ncountry; and my brother also being gone, I had no more debate either\nwith him or with myself on that subject.\n\nIt was now mid-July, and the plague, which had chiefly raged at the\nother end of the town, and, as I said before, in the parishes of St\nGiles, St Andrew's, Holborn, and towards Westminster, began to now come\neastward towards the part where I lived. It was to be observed, indeed,\nthat it did not come straight on towards us; for the city, that is to\nsay, within the walls, was indifferently healthy still; nor was it got\nthen very much over the water into Southwark; for though there died that\nweek 1268 of all distempers, whereof it might be supposed above 600 died\nof the plague, yet there was but twenty-eight in the whole city, within\nthe walls, and but nineteen in Southwark, Lambeth parish included;\nwhereas in the parishes of St Giles and St Martin-in-the-Fields alone\nthere died 421.\n\nBut we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the out-parishes, which\nbeing very populous, and fuller also of poor, the distemper found more\nto prey upon than in the city, as I shall observe afterwards. We\nperceived, I say, the distemper to draw our way, viz., by the parishes\nof Clarkenwell, Cripplegate, Shoreditch, and Bishopsgate; which last two\nparishes joining to Aldgate, Whitechappel, and Stepney, the infection\ncame at length to spread its utmost rage and violence in those parts,\neven when it abated at the western parishes where it began.\n\nIt was very strange to observe that in this particular week, from the\n4th to the 11th of July, when, as I have observed, there died near 400\nof the plague in the two parishes of St Martin and St Giles-in-the-\nFields only, there died in the parish of Aldgate but four, in the parish\nof Whitechappel three, in the parish of Stepney but one.\n\nLikewise in the next week, from the 11th of July to the 18th, when the\nweek's bill was 1761, yet there died no more of the plague, on the whole\nSouthwark side of the water, than sixteen. But this face of things soon\nchanged, and it began to thicken in Cripplegate parish especially, and\nin Clarkenwell; so that by the second week in August, Cripplegate parish\nalone buried 886, and Clarkenwell 155. Of the first, 850 might well be\nreckoned to die of the plague; and of the last, the bill itself said 145\nwere of the plague.\n\nDuring the month of July, and while, as I have observed, our part of the\ntown seemed to be spared in comparison of the west part, I went\nordinarily about the streets, as my business required, and particularly\nwent generally once in a day, or in two days, into the city, to my\nbrother's house, which he had given me charge of, and to see if it was\nsafe; and having the key in my pocket, I used to go into the house, and\nover most of the rooms, to see that all was well; for though it be\nsomething wonderful to tell, that any should have hearts so hardened in\nthe midst of such a calamity as to rob and steal, yet certain it is that\nall sorts of villainies, and even levities and debaucheries, were then\npractised in the town as openly as ever--I will not say quite as\nfrequently, because the numbers of people were many ways lessened.\n\nBut the city itself began now to be visited too, I mean within the\nwalls; but the number of people there were indeed extremely lessened by\nso great a multitude having been gone into the country; and even all\nthis month of July they continued to flee, though not in such multitudes\nas formerly. In August, indeed, they fled in such a manner that I began\nto think there would be really none but magistrates and servants left in\nthe city.\n\nAs they fled now out of the city, so I should observe that the Court\nremoved early, viz., in the month of June, and went to Oxford, where it\npleased God to preserve them; and the distemper did not, as I heard of,\nso much as touch them, for which I cannot say that I ever saw they\nshowed any great token of thankfulness, and hardly anything of\nreformation, though they did not want being told that their crying vices\nmight without breach of charity be said to have gone far in bringing\nthat terrible judgement upon the whole nation.\n\nThe face of London was--now indeed strangely altered: I mean the whole\nmass of buildings, city, liberties, suburbs, Westminster, Southwark, and\naltogether; for as to the particular part called the city, or within the\nwalls, that was not yet much infected. But in the whole the face of\nthings, I say, was much altered; sorrow and sadness sat upon every face;\nand though some parts were not yet overwhelmed, yet all looked deeply\nconcerned; and, as we saw it apparently coming on, so every one looked\non himself and his family as in the utmost danger. Were it possible to\nrepresent those times exactly to those that did not see them, and give\nthe reader due ideas of the horror 'that everywhere presented itself, it\nmust make just impressions upon their minds and fill them with surprise.\nLondon might well be said to be all in tears; the mourners did not go\nabout the streets indeed, for nobody put on black or made a formal dress\nof mourning for their nearest friends; but the voice of mourners was\ntruly heard in the streets. The shrieks of women and children at the\nwindows and doors of their houses, where their dearest relations were\nperhaps dying, or just dead, were so frequent to be heard as we passed\nthe streets, that it was enough to pierce the stoutest heart in the\nworld to hear them. Tears and lamentations were seen almost in every\nhouse, especially in the first part of the visitation; for towards the\nlatter end men's hearts were hardened, and death was so always before\ntheir eyes, that they did not so much concern themselves for the loss of\ntheir friends, expecting that themselves should be summoned the next\nhour.\n\nBusiness led me out sometimes to the other end of the town, even when\nthe sickness was chiefly there; and as the thing was new to me, as well\nas to everybody else, it was a most surprising thing to see those\nstreets which were usually so thronged now grown desolate, and so few\npeople to be seen in them, that if I had been a stranger and at a loss\nfor my way, I might sometimes have gone the length of a whole street (I\nmean of the by-streets), and seen nobody to direct me except watchmen\nset at the doors of such houses as were shut up, of which I shall speak\npresently.\n\nOne day, being at that part of the town on some special business,\ncuriosity led me to observe things more than usually, and indeed I\nwalked a great way where I had no business. I went up Holborn, and there\nthe street was full of people, but they walked in the middle of the\ngreat street, neither on one side or other, because, as I suppose, they\nwould not mingle with anybody that came out of houses, or meet with\nsmells and scent from houses that might be infected.\n\nThe Inns of Court were all shut up; nor were very many of the lawyers in\nthe Temple, or Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's Inn, to be seen there. Everybody\nwas at peace; there was no occasion for lawyers; besides, it being in\nthe time of the vacation too, they were generally gone into the country.\nWhole rows of houses in some places were shut close up, the inhabitants\nall fled, and only a watchman or two left.\n\nWhen I speak of rows of houses being shut up, I do not mean shut up by\nthe magistrates, but that great numbers of persons followed the Court,\nby the necessity of their employments and other dependences; and as\nothers retired, really frighted with the distemper, it was a mere\ndesolating of some of the streets. But the fright was not yet near so\ngreat in the city, abstractly so called, and particularly because,\nthough they were at first in a most inexpressible consternation, yet as\nI have observed that the distemper intermitted often at first, so they\nwere, as it were, alarmed and unalarmed again, and this several times,\ntill it began to be familiar to them; and that even when it appeared\nviolent, yet seeing it did not presently spread into the city, or the\neast and south parts, the people began to take courage, and to be, as I\nmay say, a little hardened. It is true a vast many people fled, as I\nhave observed, yet they were chiefly from the west end of the town, and\nfrom that we call the heart of the city: that is to say, among the\nwealthiest of the people, and such people as were unencumbered with\ntrades and business. But of the rest, the generality stayed, and seemed\nto abide the worst; so that in the place we call the Liberties, and in\nthe suburbs, in Southwark, and in the east part, such as Wapping,\nRatcliff, Stepney, Rotherhithe, and the like, the people generally\nstayed, except here and there a few wealthy families, who, as above, did\nnot depend upon their business.\n\nIt must not be forgot here that the city and suburbs were prodigiously\nfull of people at the time of this visitation, I mean at the time that\nit began; for though I have lived to see a further increase, and mighty\nthrongs of people settling in London more than ever, yet we had always a\nnotion that the numbers of people which, the wars being over, the armies\ndisbanded, and the royal family and the monarchy being restored, had\nflocked to London to settle in business, or to depend upon and attend\nthe Court for rewards of services, preferments, and the like, was such\nthat the town was computed to have in it above a hundred thousand people\nmore than ever it held before; nay, some took upon them to say it had\ntwice as many, because all the ruined families of the royal party\nflocked hither. All the old soldiers set up trades here, and abundance\nof families settled here. Again, the Court brought with them a great\nflux of pride, and new fashions. All people were grown gay and\nluxurious, and the joy of the Restoration had brought a vast many\nfamilies to London.\n\nI often thought that as Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans when the\nJews were assembled together to celebrate the Passover--by which means\nan incredible number of people were surprised there who would otherwise\nhave been in other countries--so the plague entered London when an\nincredible increase of people had happened occasionally, by the\nparticular circumstances above-named. As this conflux of the people to a\nyouthful and gay Court made a great trade in the city, especially in\neverything that belonged to fashion and finery, so it drew by\nconsequence a great number of workmen, manufacturers, and the like,\nbeing mostly poor people who depended upon their labour. And I remember\nin particular that in a representation to my Lord Mayor of the condition\nof the poor, it was estimated that there were no less than an hundred\nthousand riband-weavers in and about the city, the chiefest number of\nwhom lived then in the parishes of Shoreditch, Stepney, Whitechappel,\nand Bishopsgate, that, namely, about Spitalfields; that is to say, as\nSpitalfields was then, for it was not so large as now by one fifth part.\n\nBy this, however, the number of people in the whole may be judged of;\nand, indeed, I often wondered that, after the prodigious numbers of\npeople that went away at first, there was yet so great a multitude left\nas it appeared there was.\n\nBut I must go back again to the beginning of this surprising time. While\nthe fears of the people were young, they were increased strangely by\nseveral odd accidents which, put altogether, it was really a wonder the\nwhole body of the people did not rise as one man and abandon their\ndwellings, leaving the place as a space of ground designed by Heaven for\nan Akeldama, doomed to be destroyed from the face of the earth, and that\nall that would be found in it would perish with it. I shall name but a\nfew of these things; but sure they were so many, and so many wizards and\ncunning people propagating them, that I have often wondered there was\nany (women especially) left behind.\n\nIn the first place, a blazing star or comet appeared for several months\nbefore the plague, as there did the year after another, a little before\nthe fire. The old women and the phlegmatic hypochondriac part of the\nother sex, whom I could almost call old women too, remarked (especially\nafterward, though not till both those judgements were over) that those\ntwo comets passed directly over the city, and that so very near the\nhouses that it was plain they imported something peculiar to the city\nalone; that the comet before the pestilence was of a faint, dull,\nlanguid colour, and its motion very heavy, Solemn, and slow; but that\nthe comet before the fire was bright and sparkling, or, as others said,\nflaming, and its motion swift and furious; and that, accordingly, one\nforetold a heavy judgement, slow but severe, terrible and frightful, as\nwas the plague; but the other foretold a stroke, sudden, swift, and\nfiery as the conflagration. Nay, so particular some people were, that as\nthey looked upon that comet preceding the fire, they fancied that they\nnot only saw it pass swiftly and fiercely, and could perceive the motion\nwith their eye, but even they heard it; that it made a rushing, mighty\nnoise, fierce and terrible, though at a distance, and but just\nperceivable.\n\nI saw both these stars, and, I must confess, had so much of the common\nnotion of such things in my head, that I was apt to look upon them as\nthe forerunners and warnings of God's judgements; and especially when,\nafter the plague had followed the first, I yet saw another of the like\nkind, I could not but say God had not yet sufficiently scourged the\ncity.\n\nBut I could not at the same time carry these things to the height that\nothers did, knowing, too, that natural causes are assigned by the\nastronomers for such things, and that their motions and even their\nrevolutions are calculated, or pretended to be calculated, so that they\ncannot be so perfectly called the forerunners or foretellers, much less\nthe procurers, of such events as pestilence, war, fire, and the like.\n\nBut let my thoughts and the thoughts of the philosophers be, or have\nbeen, what they will, these things had a more than ordinary influence\nupon the minds of the common people, and they had almost universal\nmelancholy apprehensions of some dreadful calamity and judgement coming\nupon the city; and this principally from the sight of this comet, and\nthe little alarm that was given in December by two people dying at St\nGiles's, as above.\n\nThe apprehensions of the people were likewise strangely increased by the\nerror of the times; in which, I think, the people, from what principle I\ncannot imagine, were more addicted to prophecies and astrological\nconjurations, dreams, and old wives' tales than ever they were before or\nsince. Whether this unhappy temper was originally raised by the follies\nof some people who got money by it--that is to say, by printing\npredictions and prognostications--I know not; but certain it is, books\nfrighted them terribly, such as Lilly's Almanack, Gadbury's Astrological\nPredictions, Poor Robin's Almanack, and the like; also several pretended\nreligious books, one entitled, Come out of her, my People, lest you be\nPartaker of her Plagues; another called, Fair Warning; another,\nBritain's Remembrancer; and many such, all, or most part of which,\nforetold, directly or covertly, the ruin of the city. Nay, some were so\nenthusiastically bold as to run about the streets with their oral\npredictions, pretending they were sent to preach to the city; and one in\nparticular, who, like Jonah to Nineveh, cried in the streets, 'Yet forty\ndays, and London shall be destroyed.' I will not be positive whether he\nsaid yet forty days or yet a few days. Another ran about naked, except a\npair of drawers about his waist, crying day and night, like a man that\nJosephus mentions, who cried, 'Woe to Jerusalem!' a little before the\ndestruction of that city. So this poor naked creature cried, 'Oh, the\ngreat and the dreadful God!' and said no more, but repeated those words\ncontinually, with a voice and countenance full of horror, a swift pace;\nand nobody could ever find him to stop or rest, or take any sustenance,\nat least that ever I could hear of. I met this poor creature several\ntimes in the streets, and would have spoken to him, but he would not\nenter into speech with me or any one else, but held on his dismal cries\ncontinually.\n\nThese things terrified the people to the last degree, and especially\nwhen two or three times, as I have mentioned already, they found one or\ntwo in the bills dead of the plague at St Giles's.\n\nNext to these public things were the dreams of old women, or, I should\nsay, the interpretation of old women upon other people's dreams; and\nthese put abundance of people even out of their wits. Some heard voices\nwarning them to be gone, for that there would be such a plague in\nLondon, so that the living would not be able to bury the dead. Others\nsaw apparitions in the air; and I must be allowed to say of both, I hope\nwithout breach of charity, that they heard voices that never spake, and\nsaw sights that never appeared; but the imagination of the people was\nreally turned wayward and possessed. And no wonder, if they who were\nporing continually at the clouds saw shapes and figures, representations\nand appearances, which had nothing in them but air, and vapour. Here\nthey told us they saw a flaming sword held in a hand coming out of a\ncloud, with a point hanging directly over the city; there they saw\nhearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried; and there again,\nheaps of dead bodies lying unburied, and the like, just as the\nimagination of the poor terrified people furnished them with matter to\nwork upon. So hypochondriac fancies represent Ships, armies, battles in\nthe firmament; Till steady eyes the exhalations solve, And all to its\nfirst matter, cloud, resolve.\n\nI could fill this account with the strange relations such people gave\nevery day of what they had seen; and every one was so positive of their\nhaving seen what they pretended to see, that there was no contradicting\nthem without breach of friendship, or being accounted rude and\nunmannerly on the one hand, and profane and impenetrable on the other.\nOne time before the plague was begun (otherwise than as I have said in\nSt Giles's), I think it was in March, seeing a crowd of people in the\nstreet, I joined with them to satisfy my curiosity, and found them all\nstaring up into the air to see what a woman told them appeared plain to\nher, which was an angel clothed in white, with a fiery sword in his\nhand, waving it or brandishing it over his head. She described every\npart of the figure to the life, showed them the motion and the form, and\nthe poor people came into it so eagerly, and with so much readiness;\n'Yes, I see it all plainly,' says one; 'there's the sword as plain as\ncan be.' Another saw the angel. One saw his very face, and cried out\nwhat a glorious creature he was! One saw one thing, and one another. I\nlooked as earnestly as the rest, but perhaps not with so much\nwillingness to be imposed upon; and I said, indeed, that I could see\nnothing but a white cloud, bright on one side by the shining of the sun\nupon the other part. The woman endeavoured to show it me, but could not\nmake me confess that I saw it, which, indeed, if I had I must have lied.\nBut the woman, turning upon me, looked in my face, and fancied I\nlaughed, in which her imagination deceived her too, for I really did not\nlaugh, but was very seriously reflecting how the poor people were\nterrified by the force of their own imagination. However, she turned\nfrom me, called me profane fellow, and a scoffer; told me that it was a\ntime of God's anger, and dreadful judgements were approaching, and that\ndespisers such as I should wander and perish.\n\nThe people about her seemed disgusted as well as she; and I found there\nwas no persuading them that I did not laugh at them, and that I should\nbe rather mobbed by them than be able to undeceive them. So I left them;\nand this appearance passed for as real as the blazing star itself.\n\nAnother encounter I had in the open day also; and this was in going\nthrough a narrow passage from Petty France into Bishopsgate Churchyard,\nby a row of alms-houses. There are two churchyards to Bishopsgate church\nor parish; one we go over to pass from the place called Petty France\ninto Bishopsgate Street, coming out just by the church door; the other\nis on the side of the narrow passage where the alms-houses are on the\nleft; and a dwarf-wall with a palisado on it on the right hand, and the\ncity wall on the other side more to the right.\n\nIn this narrow passage stands a man looking through between the\npalisadoes into the burying-place, and as many people as the narrowness\nof the passage would admit to stop, without hindering the passage of\nothers, and he was talking mightily eagerly to them, and pointing now to\none place, then to another, and affirming that he saw a ghost walking\nupon such a gravestone there. He described the shape, the posture, and\nthe movement of it so exactly that it was the greatest matter of\namazement to him in the world that everybody did not see it as well as\nhe. On a sudden he would cry, 'There it is; now it comes this way.'\nThen, 'Tis turned back'; till at length he persuaded the people into so\nfirm a belief of it, that one fancied he saw it, and another fancied he\nsaw it; and thus he came every day making a strange hubbub, considering\nit was in so narrow a passage, till Bishopsgate clock struck eleven, and\nthen the ghost would seem to start, and, as if he were called away,\ndisappeared on a sudden.\n\nI looked earnestly every way, and at the very moment that this man\ndirected, but could not see the least appearance of anything; but so\npositive was this poor man, that he gave the people the vapours in\nabundance, and sent them away trembling and frighted, till at length few\npeople that knew of it cared to go through that passage, and hardly\nanybody by night on any account whatever.\n\nThis ghost, as the poor man affirmed, made signs to the houses, and to\nthe ground, and to the people, plainly intimating, or else they so\nunderstanding it, that abundance of the people should come to be buried\nin that churchyard, as indeed happened; but that he saw such aspects I\nmust acknowledge I never believed, nor could I see anything of it\nmyself, though I looked most earnestly to see it, if possible.\n\nThese things serve to show how far the people were really overcome with\ndelusions; and as they had a notion of the approach of a visitation, all\ntheir predictions ran upon a most dreadful plague, which should lay the\nwhole city, and even the kingdom, waste, and should destroy almost all\nthe nation, both man and beast.\n\nTo this, as I said before, the astrologers added stories of the\nconjunctions of planets in a malignant manner and with a mischievous\ninfluence, one of which conjunctions was to happen, and did happen, in\nOctober, and the other in November; and they filled the people's heads\nwith predictions on these signs of the heavens, intimating that those\nconjunctions foretold drought, famine, and pestilence. In the two first\nof them, however, they were entirely mistaken, for we had no droughty\nseason, but in the beginning of the year a hard frost, which lasted from\nDecember almost to March, and after that moderate weather, rather warm\nthan hot, with refreshing winds, and, in short, very seasonable weather,\nand also several very great rains.\n\nSome endeavours were used to suppress the printing of such books as\nterrified the people, and to frighten the dispersers of them, some of\nwhom were taken up; but nothing was done in it, as I am informed, the\nGovernment being unwilling to exasperate the people, who were, as I may\nsay, all out of their wits already.\n\nNeither can I acquit those ministers that in their sermons rather sank\nthan lifted up the hearts of their hearers. Many of them no doubt did it\nfor the strengthening the resolution of the people, and especially for\nquickening them to repentance, but it certainly answered not their end,\nat least not in proportion to the injury it did another way; and indeed,\nas God Himself through the whole Scriptures rather draws to Him by\ninvitations and calls to turn to Him and live, than drives us by terror\nand amazement, so I must confess I thought the ministers should have\ndone also, imitating our blessed Lord and Master in this, that His whole\nGospel is full of declarations from heaven of God's mercy, and His\nreadiness to receive penitents and forgive them, complaining, 'Ye will\nnot come unto Me that ye may have life', and that therefore His Gospel\nis called the Gospel of Peace and the Gospel of Grace.\n\nBut we had some good men, and that of all persuasions and opinions,\nwhose discourses were full of terror, who spoke nothing but dismal\nthings; and as they brought the people together with a kind of horror,\nsent them away in tears, prophesying nothing but evil tidings,\nterrifying the people with the apprehensions of being utterly destroyed,\nnot guiding them, at least not enough, to cry to heaven for mercy.\n\nIt was, indeed, a time of very unhappy breaches among us in matters of\nreligion. Innumerable sects and divisions and separate opinions\nprevailed among the people. The Church of England was restored, indeed,\nwith the restoration of the monarchy, about four years before; but the\nministers and preachers of the Presbyterians and Independents, and of\nall the other sorts of professions, had begun to gather separate\nsocieties and erect altar against altar, and all those had their\nmeetings for worship apart, as they have now, but not so many then, the\nDissenters being not thoroughly formed into a body as they are since;\nand those congregations which were thus gathered together were yet but\nfew. And even those that were, the Government did not allow, but\nendeavoured to suppress them and shut up their meetings.\n\nBut the visitation reconciled them again, at least for a time, and many\nof the best and most valuable ministers and preachers of the Dissenters\nwere suffered to go into the churches where the incumbents were fled\naway, as many were, not being able to stand it; and the people flocked\nwithout distinction to hear them preach, not much inquiring who or what\nopinion they were of. But after the sickness was over, that spirit of\ncharity abated; and every church being again supplied with their own\nministers, or others presented where the minister was dead, things\nreturned to their old channel again.\n\nOne mischief always introduces another. These terrors and apprehensions\nof the people led them into a thousand weak, foolish, and wicked things,\nwhich they wanted not a sort of people really wicked to encourage them\nto: and this was running about to fortune-tellers, cunning-men, and\nastrologers to know their fortune, or, as it is vulgarly expressed, to\nhave their fortunes told them, their nativities calculated, and the\nlike; and this folly presently made the town swarm with a wicked\ngeneration of pretenders to magic, to the black art, as they called it,\nand I know not what; nay, to a thousand worse dealings with the devil\nthan they were really guilty of. And this trade grew so open and so\ngenerally practised that it became common to have signs and inscriptions\nset up at doors: 'Here lives a fortune-teller', 'Here lives an\nastrologer', 'Here you may have your nativity calculated', and the like;\nand Friar Bacon's brazen-head, which was the usual sign of these\npeople's dwellings, was to be seen almost in every street, or else the\nsign of Mother Shipton, or of Merlin's head, and the like.\n\nWith what blind, absurd, and ridiculous stuff these oracles of the devil\npleased and satisfied the people I really know not, but certain it is\nthat innumerable attendants crowded about their doors every day. And if\nbut a grave fellow in a velvet jacket, a band, and a black coat, which\nwas the habit those quack-conjurers generally went in, was but seen in\nthe streets the people would follow them in crowds, and ask them\nquestions as they went along.\n\nI need not mention what a horrid delusion this was, or what it tended\nto; but there was no remedy for it till the plague itself put an end to\nit all--and, I suppose, cleared the town of most of those calculators\nthemselves. One mischief was, that if the poor people asked these mock\nastrologers whether there would be a plague or no, they all agreed in\ngeneral to answer 'Yes', for that kept up their trade. And had the\npeople not been kept in a fright about that, the wizards would presently\nhave been rendered useless, and their craft had been at an end. But they\nalways talked to them of such-and-such influences of the stars, of the\nconjunctions of such-and-such planets, which must necessarily bring\nsickness and distempers, and consequently the plague. And some had the\nassurance to tell them the plague was begun already, which was too true,\nthough they that said so knew nothing of the matter.\n\nThe ministers, to do them justice, and preachers of most sorts that were\nserious and understanding persons, thundered against these and other\nwicked practices, and exposed the folly as well as the wickedness of\nthem together, and the most sober and judicious people despised and\nabhorred them. But it was impossible to make any impression upon the\nmiddling people and the working labouring poor. Their fears were\npredominant over all their passions, and they threw away their money in\na most distracted manner upon those whimsies. Maid-servants especially,\nand men-servants, were the chief of their customers, and their question\ngenerally was, after the first demand of 'Will there be a plague?' I\nsay, the next question was, 'Oh, sir I for the Lord's sake, what will\nbecome of me? Will my mistress keep me, or will she turn me off? Will\nshe stay here, or will she go into the country? And if she goes into the\ncountry, will she take me with her, or leave me here to be starved and\nundone?' And the like of menservants.\n\nThe truth is, the case of poor servants was very dismal, as I shall have\noccasion to mention again by-and-by, for it was apparent a prodigious\nnumber of them would be turned away, and it was so. And of them\nabundance perished, and particularly of those that these false prophets\nhad flattered with hopes that they should be continued in their\nservices, and carried with their masters and mistresses into the\ncountry; and had not public charity provided for these poor creatures,\nwhose number was exceeding great and in all cases of this nature must be\nso, they would have been in the worst condition of any people in the\ncity.\n\nThese things agitated the minds of the common people for many months,\nwhile the first apprehensions were upon them, and while the plague was\nnot, as I may say, yet broken out. But I must also not forget that the\nmore serious part of the inhabitants behaved after another manner. The\nGovernment encouraged their devotion, and appointed public prayers and\ndays of fasting and humiliation, to make public confession of sin and\nimplore the mercy of God to avert the dreadful judgement which hung over\ntheir heads; and it is not to be expressed with what alacrity the people\nof all persuasions embraced the occasion; how they flocked to the\nchurches and meetings, and they were all so thronged that there was\noften no coming near, no, not to the very doors of the largest churches.\nAlso there were daily prayers appointed morning and evening at several\nchurches, and days of private praying at other places; at all which the\npeople attended, I say, with an uncommon devotion. Several private\nfamilies also, as well of one opinion as of another, kept family fasts,\nto which they admitted their near relations only. So that, in a word,\nthose people who were really serious and religious applied themselves in\na truly Christian manner to the proper work of repentance and\nhumiliation, as a Christian people ought to do.\n\nAgain, the public showed that they would bear their share in these\nthings; the very Court, which was then gay and luxurious, put on a face\nof just concern for the public danger. All the plays and interludes\nwhich, after the manner of the French Court, had been set up, and began\nto increase among us, were forbid to act; the gaming-tables, public\ndancing-rooms, and music-houses, which multiplied and began to debauch\nthe manners of the people, were shut up and suppressed; and the jack-\npuddings, merry-andrews, puppet-shows, rope-dancers, and such-like\ndoings, which had bewitched the poor common people, shut up their shops,\nfinding indeed no trade; for the minds of the people were agitated with\nother things, and a kind of sadness and horror at these things sat upon\nthe countenances even of the common people. Death was before their eyes,\nand everybody began to think of their graves, not of mirth and\ndiversions.\n\nBut even those wholesome reflections--which, rightly managed, would have\nmost happily led the people to fall upon their knees, make confession of\ntheir sins, and look up to their merciful Saviour for pardon, imploring\nHis compassion on them in such a time of their distress, by which we\nmight have been as a second Nineveh--had a quite contrary extreme in the\ncommon people, who, ignorant and stupid in their reflections as they\nwere brutishly wicked and thoughtless before, were now led by their\nfright to extremes of folly; and, as I have said before, that they ran\nto conjurers and witches, and all sorts of deceivers, to know what\nshould become of them (who fed their fears, and kept them always alarmed\nand awake on purpose to delude them and pick their pockets), so they\nwere as mad upon their running after quacks and mountebanks, and every\npractising old woman, for medicines and remedies; storing themselves\nwith such multitudes of pills, potions, and preservatives, as they were\ncalled, that they not only spent their money but even poisoned\nthemselves beforehand for fear of the poison of the infection; and\nprepared their bodies for the plague, instead of preserving them against\nit. On the other hand it is incredible and scarce to be imagined, how\nthe posts of houses and corners of streets were plastered over with\ndoctors' bills and papers of ignorant fellows, quacking and tampering in\nphysic, and inviting the people to come to them for remedies, which was\ngenerally set off with such flourishes as these, viz.: 'Infallible\npreventive pills against the plague.' 'Neverfailing preservatives\nagainst the infection.' 'Sovereign cordials against the corruption of\nthe air.' 'Exact regulations for the conduct of the body in case of an\ninfection.' 'Anti-pestilential pills.' 'Incomparable drink against the\nplague, never found out before.' 'An universal remedy for the plague.'\n'The only true plague water.' 'The royal antidote against all kinds of\ninfection';--and such a number more that I cannot reckon up; and if I\ncould, would fill a book of themselves to set them down.\n\nOthers set up bills to summon people to their lodgings for directions\nand advice in the case of infection. These had specious titles also,\nsuch as these:--\n\n'An eminent High Dutch physician, newly come over from Holland, where he\nresided during all the time of the great plague last year in Amsterdam,\nand cured multitudes of people that actually had the plague upon them.'\n\n'An Italian gentlewoman just arrived from Naples, having a choice secret\nto prevent infection, which she found out by her great experience, and\ndid wonderful cures with it in the late plague there, wherein there died\n20,000 in one day.'\n\n'An ancient gentlewoman, having practised with great success in the late\nplague in this city, anno 1636, gives her advice only to the female sex.\nTo be spoken with,' &c.\n\n'An experienced physician, who has long studied the doctrine of\nantidotes against all sorts of poison and infection, has, after forty\nyears' practice, arrived to such skill as may, with God's blessing,\ndirect persons how to prevent their being touched by any contagious\ndistemper whatsoever. He directs the poor gratis.'\n\nI take notice of these by way of specimen. I could give you two or three\ndozen of the like and yet have abundance left behind. 'Tis sufficient\nfrom these to apprise any one of the humour of those times, and how a\nset of thieves and pickpockets not only robbed and cheated the poor\npeople of their money, but poisoned their bodies with odious and fatal\npreparations; some with mercury, and some with other things as bad,\nperfectly remote from the thing pretended to, and rather hurtful than\nserviceable to the body in case an infection followed.\n\nI cannot omit a subtility of one of those quack operators, with which he\ngulled the poor people to crowd about him, but did nothing for them\nwithout money. He had, it seems, added to his bills, which he gave about\nthe streets, this advertisement in capital letters, viz., 'He gives\nadvice to the poor for nothing.'\n\nAbundance of poor people came to him accordingly, to whom he made a\ngreat many fine speeches, examined them of the state of their health and\nof the constitution of their bodies, and told them many good things for\nthem to do, which were of no great moment. But the issue and conclusion\nof all was, that he had a preparation which if they took such a quantity\nof every morning, he would pawn his life they should never have the\nplague; no, though they lived in the house with people that were\ninfected. This made the people all resolve to have it; but then the\nprice of that was so much, I think 'twas half-a-crown. 'But, sir,' says\none poor woman, 'I am a poor almswoman and am kept by the parish, and\nyour bills say you give the poor your help for nothing.' 'Ay, good\nwoman,' says the doctor, 'so I do, as I published there. I give my\nadvice to the poor for nothing, but not my physic.' 'Alas, sir!' says\nshe, 'that is a snare laid for the poor, then; for you give them advice\nfor nothing; that is to say, you advise them gratis, to buy your physic\nfor their money; so does every shop-keeper with his wares.' Here the\nwoman began to give him ill words, and stood at his door all that day,\ntelling her tale to all the people that came, till the doctor finding\nshe turned away his customers, was obliged to call her upstairs again,\nand give her his box of physic for nothing, which perhaps, too, was good\nfor nothing when she had it.\n\nBut to return to the people, whose confusions fitted them to be imposed\nupon by all sorts of pretenders and by every mountebank. There is no\ndoubt but these quacking sort of fellows raised great gains out of the\nmiserable people, for we daily found the crowds that ran after them were\ninfinitely greater, and their doors were more thronged than those of Dr\nBrooks, Dr Upton, Dr Hodges, Dr Berwick, or any, though the most famous\nmen of the time. And I was told that some of them got five pounds a day\nby their physic.\n\nBut there was still another madness beyond all this, which may serve to\ngive an idea of the distracted humour of the poor people at that time:\nand this was their following a worse sort of deceivers than any of\nthese; for these petty thieves only deluded them to pick their pockets\nand get their money, in which their wickedness, whatever it was, lay\nchiefly on the side of the deceivers, not upon the deceived. But in this\npart I am going to mention, it lay chiefly in the people deceived, or\nequally in both; and this was in wearing charms, philtres, exorcisms,\namulets, and I know not what preparations, to fortify the body with them\nagainst the plague; as if the plague was not the hand of God, but a kind\nof possession of an evil spirit, and that it was to be kept off with\ncrossings, signs of the zodiac, papers tied up with so many knots, and\ncertain words or figures written on them, as particularly the word\nAbracadabra, formed in triangle or pyramid, thus:--\n\n\n     ABRACADABRA\n     ABRACADABR     Others had the Jesuits'\n     ABRACADAB         mark in a cross:\n     ABRACADA             I H\n     ABRACAD               S.\n     ABRACA\n     ABRAC          Others nothing but this\n     ABRA               mark, thus:\n     ABR\n     AB                   * *\n     A                    {*}\n\nI might spend a great deal of time in my exclamations against the\nfollies, and indeed the wickedness, of those things, in a time of such\ndanger, in a matter of such consequences as this, of a national\ninfection. But my memorandums of these things relate rather to take\nnotice only of the fact, and mention only that it was so. How the poor\npeople found the insufficiency of those things, and how many of them\nwere afterwards carried away in the dead-carts and thrown into the\ncommon graves of every parish with these hellish charms and trumpery\nhanging about their necks, remains to be spoken of as we go along.\n\nAll this was the effect of the hurry the people were in, after the first\nnotion of the plaguebeing at hand was among them, and which may be said\nto be from about Michaelmas 1664, but more particularly after the two\nmen died in St Giles's in the beginning of December; and again, after\nanother alarm in February. For when the plague evidently spread itself,\nthey soon began to see the folly of trusting to those unperforming\ncreatures who had gulled them of their money; and then their fears\nworked another way, namely, to amazement and stupidity, not knowing what\ncourse to take or what to do either to help or relieve themselves. But\nthey ran about from one neighbour's house to another, and even in the\nstreets from one door to another, with repeated cries of, 'Lord, have\nmercy upon us! What shall we do?'\n\nIndeed, the poor people were to be pitied in one particular thing in\nwhich they had little or no relief, and which I desire to mention with a\nserious awe and reflection, which perhaps every one that reads this may\nnot relish; namely, that whereas death now began not, as we may say, to\nhover over every one's head only, but to look into their houses and\nchambers and stare in their faces. Though there might be some stupidity\nand dulness of the mind (and there was so, a great deal), yet there was\na great deal of just alarm sounded into the very inmost soul, if I may\nso say, of others. Many consciences were awakened; many hard hearts\nmelted into tears; many a penitent confession was made of crimes long\nconcealed. It would wound the soul of any Christian to have heard the\ndying groans of many a despairing creature, and none durst come near to\ncomfort them. Many a robbery, many a murder, was then confessed aloud,\nand nobody surviving to record the accounts of it. People might be\nheard, even into the streets as we passed along, calling upon God for\nmercy through Jesus Christ, and saying, 'I have been a thief, 'I have\nbeen an adulterer', 'I have been a murderer', and the like, and none\ndurst stop to make the least inquiry into such things or to administer\ncomfort to the poor creatures that in the anguish both of soul and body\nthus cried out. Some of the ministers did visit the sick at first and\nfor a little while, but it was not to be done. It would have been\npresent death to have gone into some houses. The very buriers of the\ndead, who were the hardenedest creatures in town, were sometimes beaten\nback and so terrified that they durst not go into houses where the whole\nfamilies were swept away together, and where the circumstances were more\nparticularly horrible, as some were; but this was, indeed, at the first\nheat of the distemper.\n\nTime inured them to it all, and they ventured everywhere afterwards\nwithout hesitation, as I shall have occasion to mention at large\nhereafter.\n\nI am supposing now the plague to be begun, as I have said, and that the\nmagistrates began to take the condition of the people into their serious\nconsideration. What they did as to the regulation of the inhabitants and\nof infected families, I shall speak to by itself; but as to the affair\nof health, it is proper to mention it here that, having seen the foolish\nhumour of the people in running after quacks and mountebanks, wizards\nand fortune-tellers, which they did as above, even to madness, the Lord\nMayor, a very sober and religious gentleman, appointed physicians and\nsurgeons for relief of the poor--I mean the diseased poor and in\nparticular ordered the College of Physicians to publish directions for\ncheap remedies for the poor, in all the circumstances of the distemper.\nThis, indeed, was one of the most charitable and judicious things that\ncould be done at that time, for this drove the people from haunting the\ndoors of every disperser of bills, and from taking down blindly and\nwithout consideration poison for physic and death instead of life.\n\nThis direction of the physicians was done by a consultation of the whole\nCollege; and, as it was particularly calculated for the use of the poor\nand for cheap medicines, it was made public, so that everybody might see\nit, and copies were given gratis to all that desired it. But as it is\npublic, and to be seen on all occasions, I need not give the reader of\nthis the trouble of it.\n\nI shall not be supposed to lessen the authority or capacity of the\nphysicians when I say that the violence of the distemper, when it came\nto its extremity, was like the fire the next year. The fire, which\nconsumed what the plague could not touch, defied all the application of\nremedies; the fire-engines were broken, the buckets thrown away, and the\npower of man was baffled and brought to an end. So the Plague defied all\nmedicines; the very physicians were seized with it, with their\npreservatives in their mouths; and men went about prescribing to others\nand telling them what to do till the tokens were upon them, and they\ndropped down dead, destroyed by that very enemy they directed others to\noppose. This was the case of several physicians, even some of them the\nmost eminent, and of several of the most skilful surgeons. Abundance of\nquacks too died, who had the folly to trust to their own medicines,\nwhich they must needs be conscious to themselves were good for nothing,\nand who rather ought, like other sorts of thieves, to have run away,\nsensible of their guilt, from the justice that they could not but expect\nshould punish them as they knew they had deserved.\n\nNot that it is any derogation from the labour or application of the\nphysicians to say they fell in the common calamity; nor is it so\nintended by me; it rather is to their praise that they ventured their\nlives so far as even to lose them in the service of mankind. They\nendeavoured to do good, and to save the lives of others. But we were not\nto expect that the physicians could stop God's judgements, or prevent a\ndistemper eminently armed from heaven from executing the errand it was\nsent about.\n\nDoubtless, the physicians assisted many by their skill, and by their\nprudence and applications, to the saving of their lives and restoring\ntheir health. But it is not lessening their character or their skill, to\nsay they could not cure those that had the tokens upon them, or those\nwho were mortally infected before the physicians were sent for, as was\nfrequently the case.\n\nIt remains to mention now what public measures were taken by the\nmagistrates for the general safety, and to prevent the spreading of the\ndistemper, when it first broke out. I shall have frequent occasion to\nspeak of the prudence of the magistrates, their charity, their vigilance\nfor the poor, and for preserving good order, furnishing provisions, and\nthe like, when the plague was increased, as it afterwards was. But I am\nnow upon the order and regulations they published for the government of\ninfected families.\n\nI mentioned above shutting of houses up; and it is needful to say\nsomething particularly to that, for this part of the history of the\nplague is very melancholy, but the most grievous story must be told.\n\nAbout June the Lord Mayor of London and the Court of Aldermen, as I have\nsaid, began more particularly to concern themselves for the regulation\nof the city.\n\nThe justices of Peace for Middlesex, by direction of the Secretary of\nState, had begun to shut up houses in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-\nFields, St Martin, St Clement Danes, &c., and it was with good success;\nfor in several streets where the plague broke out, upon strict guarding\nthe houses that were infected, and taking care to bury those that died\nimmediately after they were known to be dead, the plague ceased in those\nstreets. It was also observed that the plague decreased sooner in those\nparishes after they had been visited to the full than it did in the\nparishes of Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Aldgate, Whitechappel, Stepney, and\nothers; the early care taken in that manner being a great means to the\nputting a check to it.\n\nThis shutting up of houses was a method first taken, as I understand, in\nthe plague which happened in 1603, at the coming of King James the First\nto the crown; and the power of shutting people up in their own houses\nwas granted by Act of Parliament, entitled, 'An Act for the charitable\nRelief and Ordering of Persons infected with the Plague'; on which Act\nof Parliament the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the city of London founded\nthe order they made at this time, and which took place the 1st of July\n1665, when the numbers infected within the city were but few, the last\nbill for the ninety-two parishes being but four; and some houses having\nbeen shut up in the city, and some people being removed to the pest-\nhouse beyond Bunhill Fields, in the way to Islington,--I say, by these\nmeans, when there died near one thousand a week in the whole, the number\nin the city was but twenty-eight, and the city was preserved more\nhealthy in proportion than any other place all the time of the\ninfection.\n\nThese orders of my Lord Mayor's were published, as I have said, the\nlatter end of June, and took place from the 1st of July, and were as\nfollows, viz.:--\n\nORDERS CONCEIVED AND PUBLISHED BY THE LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF THE\nCITY OF LONDON CONCERNING THE INFECTION OF THE PLAGUE, 1665.\n\n'WHEREAS in the reign of our late Sovereign King James, of happy memory,\nan Act was made for the charitable relief and ordering of persons\ninfected with the plague, whereby authority was given to justices of the\npeace, mayors, bailiffs, and other head-officers to appoint within their\nseveral limits examiners, searchers, watchmen, keepers, and buriers for\nthe persons and places infected, and to minister unto them oaths for the\nperformance of their offices. And the same statute did also authorise\nthe giving of other directions, as unto them for the present necessity\nshould seem good in their directions. It is now, upon special\nconsideration, thought very expedient for preventing and avoiding of\ninfection of sickness (if it shall so please Almighty God) that these\nofficers following be appointed, and these orders hereafter duly\nobserved.\n\nExaminers to be appointed in every Parish.\n\n'First, it is thought requisite, and so ordered, that in every parish\nthere be one, two, or more persons of good sort and credit chosen and\nappointed by the alderman, his deputy, and common council of every ward,\nby the name of examiners, to continue in that office the space of two\nmonths at least. And if any fit person so appointed shall refuse to\nundertake the same, the said parties so refusing to be committed to\nprison until they shall conform themselves accordingly.\n\nThe Examiner's Office.\n\n'That these examiners be sworn by the aldermen to inquire and learn from\ntime to time what houses in every parish be visited, and what persons be\nsick, and of what diseases, as near as they can inform themselves; and\nupon doubt in that case, to command restraint of access until it appear\nwhat the disease shall prove. And if they find any person sick of the\ninfection, to give order to the constable that the house be shut up; and\nif the constable shall be found remiss or negligent, to give present\nnotice thereof to the alderman of the ward.\n\nWatchmen.\n\n'That to every infected house there be appointed two watchmen, one for\nevery day, and the other for the night; and that these watchmen have a\nspecial care that no person go in or out of such infected houses whereof\nthey have the charge, upon pain of severe punishment. And the said\nwatchmen to do such further offices as the sick house shall need and\nrequire: and if the watchman be sent upon any business, to lock up the\nhouse and take the key with him; and the watchman by day to attend until\nten of the clock at night, and the watchman by night until six in the\nmorning.\n\nSearchers.\n\n'That there be a special care to appoint women searchers in every\nparish, such as are of honest reputation, and of the best sort as can be\ngot in this kind; and these to be sworn to make due search and true\nreport to the utmost of their knowledge whether the persons whose bodies\nthey are appointed to search do die of the infection, or of what other\ndiseases, as near as they can. And that the physicians who shall be\nappointed for cure and prevention of the infection do call before them\nthe said searchers who are, or shall be, appointed for the several\nparishes under their respective cares, to the end they may consider\nwhether they are fitly qualified for that employment, and charge them\nfrom time to time as they shall see cause, if they appear defective in\ntheir duties.\n\n'That no searcher during this time of visitation be permitted to use any\npublic work or employment, or keep any shop or stall, or be employed as\na laundress, or in any other common employment whatsoever.\n\nChirurgeons.\n\n'For better assistance of the searchers, forasmuch as there hath been\nheretofore great abuse in misreporting the disease, to the further\nspreading of the infection, it is therefore ordered that there be chosen\nand appointed able and discreet chirurgeons, besides those that do\nalready belong to the pest-house, amongst whom the city and Liberties to\nbe quartered as the places lie most apt and convenient; and every of\nthese to have one quarter for his limit; and the said chirurgeons in\nevery of their limits to join with the searchers for the view of the\nbody, to the end there may be a true report made of the disease.\n\n'And further, that the said chirurgeons shall visit and search such-like\npersons as shall either send for them or be named and directed unto them\nby the examiners of every parish, and inform themselves of the disease\nof the said parties.\n\n'And forasmuch as the said chirurgeons are to be sequestered from all\nother cures, and kept only to this disease of the infection, it is\nordered that every of the said chirurgeons shall have twelve-pence a\nbody searched by them, to be paid out of the goods of the party\nsearched, if he be able, or otherwise by the parish.\n\nNurse-keepers.\n\n'If any nurse-keeper shall remove herself out of any infected house\nbefore twenty-eight days after the decease of any person dying of the\ninfection, the house to which the said nurse-keeper doth so remove\nherself shall be shut up until the said twenty-eight days be expired.'\n\nORDERS CONCERNING INFECTED HOUSES AND PERSONS SICK OF THE PLAGUE.\n\nNotice to be given of the Sickness.\n\n'The master of every house, as soon as any one in his house complaineth,\neither of blotch or purple, or swelling in any part of his body, or\nfalleth otherwise dangerously sick, without apparent cause of some other\ndisease, shall give knowledge thereof to the examiner of health within\ntwo hours after the said sign shall appear.\n\nSequestration of the Sick.\n\n'As soon as any man shall be found by this examiner, chirurgeon, or\nsearcher to be sick of the plague, he shall the same night be\nsequestered in the same house; and in case he be so sequestered, then\nthough he afterwards die not, the house wherein he sickened should be\nshut up for a month, after the use of the due preservatives taken by the\nrest.\n\nAiring the Stuff.\n\n'For sequestration of the goods and stuff of the infection, their\nbedding and apparel and hangings of chambers must be well aired with\nfire and such perfumes as are requisite within the infected house before\nthey be taken again to use. This to be done by the appointment of an\nexaminer.\n\nShutting up of the House.\n\n'If any person shall have visited any man known to be infected of the\nplague, or entered willingly into any known infected house, being not\nallowed, the house wherein he inhabiteth shall be shut up for certain\ndays by the examiner's direction.\n\nNone to be removed out of infected Houses, but, &C.\n\n'Item, that none be removed out of the house where he falleth sick of\nthe infection into any other house in the city (except it be to the\npest-house or a tent, or unto some such house which the owner of the\nsaid visited house holdeth in his own hands and occupieth by his own\nservants); and so as security be given to the parish whither such remove\nis made, that the attendance and charge about the said visited persons\nshall be observed and charged in all the particularities before\nexpressed, without any cost of that parish to which any such remove\nshall happen to be made, and this remove to be done by night. And it\nshall be lawful to any person that hath two houses to remove either his\nsound or his infected people to his spare house at his choice, so as, if\nhe send away first his sound, he not after send thither his sick, nor\nagain unto the sick the sound; and that the same which he sendeth be for\none week at the least shut up and secluded from company, for fear of\nsome infection at the first not appearing.\n\nBurial of the Dead.\n\n'That the burial of the dead by this visitation be at most convenient\nhours, always either before sun-rising or after sun-setting, with the\nprivity of the churchwardens or constable, and not otherwise; and that\nno neighbours nor friends be suffered to accompany the corpse to church,\nor to enter the house visited, upon pain of having his house shut up or\nbe imprisoned.\n\n'And that no corpse dying of infection shall be buried, or remain in any\nchurch in time of common prayer, sermon, or lecture. And that no\nchildren be suffered at time of burial of any corpse in any church,\nchurchyard, or burying-place to come near the corpse, coffin, or grave.\nAnd that all the graves shall be at least six feet deep.\n\n'And further, all public assemblies at other burials are to be foreborne\nduring the continuance of this visitation.\n\nNo infected Stuff to be uttered.\n\n'That no clothes, stuff, bedding, or garments be suffered to be carried\nor conveyed out of any infected houses, and that the criers and carriers\nabroad of bedding or old apparel to be sold or pawned be utterly\nprohibited and restrained, and no brokers of bedding or old apparel be\npermitted to make any outward show, or hang forth on their stalls, shop-\nboards, or windows, towards any street, lane, common way, or passage,\nany old bedding or apparel to be sold, upon pain of imprisonment. And if\nany broker or other person shall buy any bedding, apparel, or other\nstuff out of any infected house within two months after the infection\nhath been there, his house shall be shut up as infected, and so shall\ncontinue shut up twenty days at the least.\n\nNo Person to be conveyed out of any infected House.\n\n'If any person visited do fortune, by negligent looking unto, or by any\nother means, to come or be conveyed from a place infected to any other\nplace, the parish from whence such party hath come or been conveyed,\nupon notice thereof given, shall at their charge cause the said party so\nvisited and escaped to be carried and brought back again by night, and\nthe parties in this case offending to be punished at the direction of\nthe alderman of the ward, and the house of the receiver of such visited\nperson to be shut up for twenty days.\n\nEvery visited House to be marked.\n\n'That every house visited be marked with a red cross of a foot long in\nthe middle of the door, evident to be seen, and with these usual printed\nwords, that is to say, \"Lord, have mercy upon us,\" to be set close over\nthe same cross, there to continue until lawful opening of the same\nhouse.\n\nEvery visited House to be watched.\n\n'That the constables see every house shut up, and to be attended with\nwatchmen, which may keep them in, and minister necessaries unto them at\ntheir own charges, if they be able, or at the common charge, if they are\nunable; the shutting up to be for the space of four weeks after all be\nwhole.\n\n'That precise order to be taken that the searchers, chirurgeons,\nkeepers, and buriers are not to pass the streets without holding a red\nrod or wand of three feet in length in their hands, open and evident to\nbe seen, and are not to go into any other house than into their own, or\ninto that whereunto they are directed or sent for; but to forbear and\nabstain from company, especially when they have been lately used in any\nsuch business or attendance.\n\nInmates.\n\n'That where several inmates are in one and the same house, and any\nperson in that house happens to be infected, no other person or family\nof such house shall be suffered to remove him or themselves without a\ncertificate from the examiners of health of that parish; or in default\nthereof, the house whither he or they so remove shall be shut up as in\ncase of visitation.\n\nHackney-Coaches.\n\n'That care be taken of hackney-coachmen, that they may not (as some of\nthem have been observed to do after carrying of infected persons to the\npest-house and other places) be admitted to common use till their\ncoaches be well aired, and have stood unemployed by the space of five or\nsix days after such service.'\n\nORDERS FOR CLEANSING AND KEEPING OF THE STREETS SWEPT.\n\nThe Streets to be kept Clean.\n\n'First, it is thought necessary, and so ordered, that every householder\ndo cause the street to be daily prepared before his door, and so to keep\nit clean swept all the week long.\n\nThat Rakers take it from out the Houses.\n\n'That the sweeping and filth of houses be daily carried away by the\nrakers, and that the raker shall give notice of his coming by the\nblowing of a horn, as hitherto hath been done.\n\nLaystalls to be made far off from the City.\n\n'That the laystalls be removed as far as may be out of the city and\ncommon passages, and that no nightman or other be suffered to empty a\nvault into any garden near about the city.\n\nCare to be had of unwholesome Fish or Flesh, and of musty Corn.\n\n'That special care be taken that no stinking fish, or unwholesome flesh,\nor musty corn, or other corrupt fruits of what sort soever, be suffered\nto be sold about the city, or any part of the same.\n\n'That the brewers and tippling-houses be looked into for musty and\nunwholesome casks.\n\n'That no hogs, dogs, or cats, or tame pigeons, or ponies, be suffered to\nbe kept within any part of the city, or any swine to be or stray in the\nstreets or lanes, but that such swine be impounded by the beadle or any\nother officer, and the owner punished according to Act of Common\nCouncil, and that the dogs be killed by the dog-killers appointed for\nthat purpose.'\n\nORDERS CONCERNING LOOSE PERSONS AND IDLE ASSEMBLIES.\n\nBeggars.\n\n'Forasmuch as nothing is more complained of than the multitude of rogues\nand wandering beggars that swarm in every place about the city, being a\ngreat cause of the spreading of the infection, and will not be avoided,\nnotwithstanding any orders that have been given to the contrary: It is\ntherefore now ordered, that such constables, and others whom this matter\nmay any way concern, take special care that no wandering beggars be\nsuffered in the streets of this city in any fashion or manner\nwhatsoever, upon the penalty provided by the law, to be duly and\nseverely executed upon them.\n\nPlays.\n\n'That all plays, bear-baitings, games, singing of ballads, buckler-play,\nor such-like causes of assemblies of people be utterly prohibited, and\nthe parties offending severely punished by every alderman in his ward.\n\nFeasting prohibited.\n\n'That all public feasting, and particularly by the companies of this\ncity, and dinners at taverns, ale-houses, and other places of common\nentertainment, be forborne till further order and allowance; and that\nthe money thereby spared be preserved and employed for the benefit and\nrelief of the poor visited with the infection.\n\nTippling-houses.\n\n'That disorderly tippling in taverns, ale-houses, coffee-houses, and\ncellars be severely looked unto, as the common sin of this time and\ngreatest occasion of dispersing the plague. And that no company or\nperson be suffered to remain or come into any tavern, ale-house, or\ncoffee-house to drink after nine of the clock in the evening, according\nto the ancient law and custom of this city, upon the penalties ordained\nin that behalf.\n\n'And for the better execution of these orders, and such other rules and\ndirections as, upon further consideration, shall be found needful: It is\nordered and enjoined that the aldermen, deputies, and common councilmen\nshall meet together weekly, once, twice, thrice or oftener (as cause\nshall require), at some one general place accustomed in their respective\nwards (being clear from infection of the plague), to consult how the\nsaid orders may be duly put in execution; not intending that any\ndwelling in or near places infected shall come to the said meeting while\ntheir coming may be doubtful. And the said aldermen, and deputies, and\ncommon councilmen in their several wards may put in execution any other\ngood orders that by them at their said meetings shall be conceived and\ndevised for preservation of his Majesty's subjects from the infection.\n\n    'SIR JOHN LAWRENCE, Lord Mayor.\n    SIR GEORGE WATERMAN\n    SIR CHARLES DOE, Sheriffs.'\n\nI need not say that these orders extended only to such places as were\nwithin the Lord Mayor's jurisdiction, so it is requisite to observe that\nthe justices of Peace within those parishes and places as were called\nthe Hamlets and out-parts took the same method. As I remember, the\norders for shutting up of houses did not take Place so soon on our side,\nbecause, as I said before, the plague did not reach to these eastern\nparts of the town at least, nor begin to be very violent, till the\nbeginning of August. For example, the whole bill from the 11th to the\n18th of July was 1761, yet there died but 71 of the plague in all those\nparishes we call the Tower Hamlets, and they were as follows:--\n\n\n     -                           The next week   And to the 1st\n     -                             was thus:     of Aug. thus:\n     Aldgate               14          34               65\n     Stepney               33          58               76\n     Whitechappel          21          48               79\n     St Katherine, Tower    2           4                4\n     Trinity, Minories      1           1                4\n     -                    ---         ---              ---\n     -                     71         145              228\n\nIt was indeed coming on amain, for the burials that same week were in\nthe next adjoining parishes thus:--\n\n\n     -                                The next week\n     -                                prodigiously    To the 1st of\n     -                                increased, as:   Aug. thus:\n     St Leonard's, Shoreditch      64       84          110\n     St Botolph's, Bishopsgate     65      105          116\n     St Giles's, Cripplegate      213      421          554\n     -                            ---      ---          ---\n     -                            342      610          780\n\nThis shutting up of houses was at first counted a very cruel and\nunchristian method, and the poor people so confined made bitter\nlamentations. Complaints of the severity of it were also daily brought\nto my Lord Mayor, of houses causelessly (and some maliciously) shut up.\nI cannot say; but upon inquiry many that complained so loudly were found\nin a condition to be continued; and others again, inspection being made\nupon the sick person, and the sickness not appearing infectious, or if\nuncertain, yet on his being content to be carried to the pest-house,\nwere released.\n\nIt is true that the locking up the doors of people's houses, and setting\na watchman there night and day to prevent their stirring out or any\ncoming to them, when perhaps the sound people in the family might have\nescaped if they had been removed from the sick, looked very hard and\ncruel; and many people perished in these miserable confinements which,\n'tis reasonable to believe, would not have been distempered if they had\nhad liberty, though the plague was in the house; at which the people\nwere very clamorous and uneasy at first, and several violences were\ncommitted and injuries offered to the men who were set to watch the\nhouses so shut up; also several people broke out by force in many\nplaces, as I shall observe by-and-by. But it was a public good that\njustified the private mischief, and there was no obtaining the least\nmitigation by any application to magistrates or government at that time,\nat least not that I heard of. This put the people upon all manner of\nstratagem in order, if possible, to get out; and it would fill a little\nvolume to set down the arts used by the people of such houses to shut\nthe eyes of the watchmen who were employed, to deceive them, and to\nescape or break out from them, in which frequent scuffles and some\nmischief happened; of which by itself.\n\nAs I went along Houndsditch one morning about eight o'clock there was a\ngreat noise. It is true, indeed, there was not much crowd, because\npeople were not very free to gather together, or to stay long together\nwhen they were there; nor did I stay long there. But the outcry was loud\nenough to prompt my curiosity, and I called to one that looked out of a\nwindow, and asked what was the matter.\n\nA watchman, it seems, had been employed to keep his post at the door of\na house which was infected, or said to be infected, and was shut up. He\nhad been there all night for two nights together, as he told his story,\nand the day-watchman had been there one day, and was now come to relieve\nhim. All this while no noise had been heard in the house, no light had\nbeen seen; they called for nothing, sent him of no errands, which used\nto be the chief business of the watchmen; neither had they given him any\ndisturbance, as he said, from the Monday afternoon, when he heard great\ncrying and screaming in the house, which, as he supposed, was occasioned\nby some of the family dying just at that time. It seems, the night\nbefore, the dead-cart, as it was called, had been stopped there, and a\nservant-maid had been brought down to the door dead, and the buriers or\nbearers, as they were called, put her into the cart, wrapt only in a\ngreen rug, and carried her away.\n\nThe watchman had knocked at the door, it seems, when he heard that noise\nand crying, as above, and nobody answered a great while; but at last one\nlooked out and said with an angry, quick tone, and yet a kind of crying\nvoice, or a voice of one that was crying, 'What d'ye want, that ye make\nsuch a knocking?' He answered, 'I am the watchman! How do you do? What\nis the matter?' The person answered, 'What is that to you? Stop the\ndead-cart.' This, it seems, was about one o'clock. Soon after, as the\nfellow said, he stopped the dead-cart, and then knocked again, but\nnobody answered. He continued knocking, and the bellman called out\nseveral times, 'Bring out your dead'; but nobody answered, till the man\nthat drove the cart, being called to other houses, would stay no longer,\nand drove away.\n\nThe watchman knew not what to make of all this, so he let them alone\ntill the morning-man or day-watchman, as they called him, came to\nrelieve him. Giving him an account of the particulars, they knocked at\nthe door a great while, but nobody answered; and they observed that the\nwindow or casement at which the person had looked out who had answered\nbefore continued open, being up two pair of stairs.\n\nUpon this the two men, to satisfy their curiosity, got a long ladder,\nand one of them went up to the window and looked into the room, where he\nsaw a woman lying dead upon the floor in a dismal manner, having no\nclothes on her but her shift. But though he called aloud, and putting in\nhis long staff, knocked hard on the floor, yet nobody stirred or\nanswered; neither could he hear any noise in the house.\n\nHe came down again upon this, and acquainted his fellow, who went up\nalso; and finding it just so, they resolved to acquaint either the Lord\nMayor or some other magistrate of it, but did not offer to go in at the\nwindow. The magistrate, it seems, upon the information of the two men,\nordered the house to be broke open, a constable and other persons being\nappointed to be present, that nothing might be plundered; and\naccordingly it was so done, when nobody was found in the house but that\nyoung woman, who having been infected and past recovery, the rest had\nleft her to die by herself, and were every one gone, having found some\nway to delude the watchman, and to get open the door, or get out at some\nback-door, or over the tops of the houses, so that he knew nothing of\nit; and as to those cries and shrieks which he heard, it was supposed\nthey were the passionate cries of the family at the bitter parting,\nwhich, to be sure, it was to them all, this being the sister to the\nmistress of the family. The man of the house, his wife, several\nchildren, and servants, being all gone and fled, whether sick or sound,\nthat I could never learn; nor, indeed, did I make much inquiry after it.\n\nMany such escapes were made out of infected houses, as particularly when\nthe watchman was sent of some errand; for it was his business to go of\nany errand that the family sent him of; that is to say, for necessaries,\nsuch as food and physic; to fetch physicians, if they would come, or\nsurgeons, or nurses, or to order the dead-cart, and the like; but with\nthis condition, too, that when he went he was to lock up the outer door\nof the house and take the key away with him, To evade this, and cheat\nthe watchmen, people got two or three keys made to their locks, or they\nfound ways to unscrew the locks such as were screwed on, and so take off\nthe lock, being in the inside of the house, and while they sent away the\nwatchman to the market, to the bakehouse, or for one trifle or another,\nopen the door and go out as often as they pleased. But this being found\nout, the officers afterwards had orders to padlock up the doors on the\noutside, and place bolts on them as they thought fit.\n\nAt another house, as I was informed, in the street next within Aldgate,\na whole family was shut up and locked in because the maid-servant was\ntaken sick. The master of the house had complained by his friends to the\nnext alderman and to the Lord Mayor, and had consented to have the maid\ncarried to the pest-house, but was refused; so the door was marked with\na red cross, a padlock on the outside, as above, and a watchman set to\nkeep the door, according to public order.\n\nAfter the master of the house found there was no remedy, but that he,\nhis wife, and his children were to be locked up with this poor\ndistempered servant, he called to the watchman, and told him he must go\nthen and fetch a nurse for them to attend this poor girl, for that it\nwould be certain death to them all to oblige them to nurse her; and told\nhim plainly that if he would not do this, the maid must perish either of\nthe distemper or be starved for want of food, for he was resolved none\nof his family should go near her; and she lay in the garret four storey\nhigh, where she could not cry out, or call to anybody for help.\n\nThe watchman consented to that, and went and fetched a nurse, as he was\nappointed, and brought her to them the same evening. During this\ninterval the master of the house took his opportunity to break a large\nhole through his shop into a bulk or stall, where formerly a cobbler had\nsat, before or under his shop-window; but the tenant, as may be supposed\nat such a dismal time as that, was dead or removed, and so he had the\nkey in his own keeping. Having made his way into this stall, which he\ncould not have done if the man had been at the door, the noise he was\nobliged to make being such as would have alarmed the watchman; I say,\nhaving made his way into this stall, he sat still till the watchman\nreturned with the nurse, and all the next day also. But the night\nfollowing, having contrived to send the watchman of another trifling\nerrand, which, as I take it, was to an apothecary's for a plaister for\nthe maid, which he was to stay for the making up, or some other such\nerrand that might secure his staying some time; in that time he conveyed\nhimself and all his family out of the house, and left the nurse and the\nwatchman to bury the poor wench--that is, throw her into the cart--and\ntake care of the house.\n\nI could give a great many such stories as these, diverting enough, which\nin the long course of that dismal year I met with--that is, heard of--\nand which are very certain to be true, or very near the truth; that is\nto say, true in the general: for no man could at such a time learn all\nthe particulars. There was likewise violence used with the watchmen, as\nwas reported, in abundance of places; and I believe that from the\nbeginning of the visitation to the end, there was not less than eighteen\nor twenty of them killed, or so wounded as to be taken up for dead,\nwhich was supposed to be done by the people in the infected houses which\nwere shut up, and where they attempted to come out and were opposed.\n\nNor, indeed, could less be expected, for here were so many prisons in\nthe town as there were houses shut up; and as the people shut up or\nimprisoned so were guilty of no crime, only shut up because miserable,\nit was really the more intolerable to them.\n\nIt had also this difference, that every prison, as we may call it, had\nbut one jailer, and as he had the whole house to guard, and that many\nhouses were so situated as that they had several ways out, some more,\nsome less, and some into several streets, it was impossible for one man\nso to guard all the passages as to prevent the escape of people made\ndesperate by the fright of their circumstances, by the resentment of\ntheir usage, or by the raging of the distemper itself; so that they\nwould talk to the watchman on one side of the house, while the family\nmade their escape at another.\n\nFor example, in Coleman Street there are abundance of alleys, as appears\nstill. A house was shut up in that they call White's Alley; and this\nhouse had a back-window, not a door, into a court which had a passage\ninto Bell Alley. A watchman was set by the constable at the door of this\nhouse, and there he stood, or his comrade, night and day, while the\nfamily went all away in the evening out at that window into the court,\nand left the poor fellows warding and watching for near a fortnight.\n\nNot far from the same place they blew up a watchman with gunpowder, and\nburned the poor fellow dreadfully; and while he made hideous cries, and\nnobody would venture to come near to help him, the whole family that\nwere able to stir got out at the windows one storey high, two that were\nleft sick calling out for help. Care was taken to give them nurses to\nlook after them, but the persons fled were never found, till after the\nplague was abated they returned; but as nothing could be proved, so\nnothing could be done to them.\n\nIt is to be considered, too, that as these were prisons without bars and\nbolts, which our common prisons are furnished with, so the people let\nthemselves down out of their windows, even in the face of the watchman,\nbringing swords or pistols in their hands, and threatening the poor\nwretch to shoot him if he stirred or called for help.\n\nIn other cases, some had gardens, and walls or pales, between them and\ntheir neighbours, or yards and back-houses; and these, by friendship and\nentreaties, would get leave to get over those walls or pales, and so go\nout at their neighbours' doors; or, by giving money to their servants,\nget them to let them through in the night; so that in short, the\nshutting up of houses was in no wise to be depended upon. Neither did it\nanswer the end at all, serving more to make the people desperate, and\ndrive them to such extremities as that they would break out at all\nadventures.\n\nAnd that which was still worse, those that did thus break out spread the\ninfection farther by their wandering about with the distemper upon them,\nin their desperate circumstances, than they would otherwise have done;\nfor whoever considers all the particulars in such cases must\nacknowledge, and we cannot doubt but the severity of those confinements\nmade many people desperate, and made them run out of their houses at all\nhazards, and with the plague visibly upon them, not knowing either\nwhither to go or what to do, or, indeed, what they did; and many that\ndid so were driven to dreadful exigencies and extremities, and perished\nin the streets or fields for mere want, or dropped down by the raging\nviolence of the fever upon them. Others wandered into the country, and\nwent forward any way, as their desperation guided them, not knowing\nwhither they went or would go: till, faint and tired, and not getting\nany relief, the houses and villages on the road refusing to admit them\nto lodge whether infected or no, they have perished by the roadside or\ngotten into barns and died there, none daring to come to them or relieve\nthem, though perhaps not infected, for nobody would believe them.\n\nOn the other hand, when the plague at first seized a family that is to\nsay, when any body of the family had gone out and unwarily or otherwise\ncatched the distemper and brought it home--it was certainly known by the\nfamily before it was known to the officers, who, as you will see by the\norder, were appointed to examine into the circumstances of all sick\npersons when they heard of their being sick.\n\nIn this interval, between their being taken sick and the examiners\ncoming, the master of the house had leisure and liberty to remove\nhimself or all his family, if he knew whither to go, and many did so.\nBut the great disaster was that many did thus after they were really\ninfected themselves, and so carried the disease into the houses of those\nwho were so hospitable as to receive them; which, it must be confessed,\nwas very cruel and ungrateful.\n\nAnd this was in part the reason of the general notion, or scandal\nrather, which went about of the temper of people infected: namely, that\nthey did not take the least care or make any scruple of infecting\nothers, though I cannot say but there might be some truth in it too, but\nnot so general as was reported. What natural reason could be given for\nso wicked a thing at a time when they might conclude themselves just\ngoing to appear at the bar of Divine justice I know not. I am very well\nsatisfied that it cannot be reconciled to religion and principle any\nmore than it can be to generosity and Humanity, but I may speak of that\nagain.\n\nI am speaking now of people made desperate by the apprehensions of their\nbeing shut up, and their breaking out by stratagem or force, either\nbefore or after they were shut up, whose misery was not lessened when\nthey were out, but sadly increased. On the other hand, many that thus\ngot away had retreats to go to and other houses, where they locked\nthemselves up and kept hid till the plague was over; and many families,\nforeseeing the approach of the distemper, laid up stores of provisions\nsufficient for their whole families, and shut themselves up, and that so\nentirely that they were neither seen or heard of till the infection was\nquite ceased, and then came abroad sound and well. I might recollect\nseveral such as these, and give you the particulars of their management;\nfor doubtless it was the most effectual secure step that could be taken\nfor such whose circumstances would not admit them to remove, or who had\nnot retreats abroad proper for the case; for in being thus shut up they\nwere as if they had been a hundred miles off. Nor do I remember that any\none of those families miscarried. Among these, several Dutch merchants\nwere particularly remarkable, who kept their houses like little\ngarrisons besieged suffering none to go in or out or come near them,\nparticularly one in a court in Throgmorton Street whose house looked\ninto Draper's Garden.\n\nBut I come back to the case of families infected and shut up by the\nmagistrates. The misery of those families is not to be expressed; and it\nwas generally in such houses that we heard the most dismal shrieks and\noutcries of the poor people, terrified and even frighted to death by the\nsight of the condition of their dearest relations, and by the terror of\nbeing imprisoned as they were.\n\nI remember, and while I am writing this story I think I hear the very\nsound of it, a certain lady had an only daughter, a young maiden about\nnineteen years old, and who was possessed of a very considerable\nfortune. They were only lodgers in the house where they were. The young\nwoman, her mother, and the maid had been abroad on some occasion, I do\nnot remember what, for the house was not shut up; but about two hours\nafter they came home the young lady complained she was not well; in a\nquarter of an hour more she vomited and had a violent pain in her head.\n'Pray God', says her mother, in a terrible fright, 'my child has not the\ndistemper!' The pain in her head increasing, her mother ordered the bed\nto be warmed, and resolved to put her to bed, and prepared to give her\nthings to sweat, which was the ordinary remedy to be taken when the\nfirst apprehensions of the distemper began.\n\nWhile the bed was airing the mother undressed the young woman, and just\nas she was laid down in the bed, she, looking upon her body with a\ncandle, immediately discovered the fatal tokens on the inside of her\nthighs. Her mother, not being able to contain herself, threw down her\ncandle and shrieked out in such a frightful manner that it was enough to\nplace horror upon the stoutest heart in the world; nor was it one scream\nor one cry, but the fright having seized her spirits, she--fainted\nfirst, then recovered, then ran all over the house, up the stairs and\ndown the stairs, like one distracted, and indeed really was distracted,\nand continued screeching and crying out for several hours void of all\nsense, or at least government of her senses, and, as I was told, never\ncame thoroughly to herself again. As to the young maiden, she was a dead\ncorpse from that moment, for the gangrene which occasions the spots had\nspread [over] her whole body, and she died in less than two hours. But\nstill the mother continued crying out, not knowing anything more of her\nchild, several hours after she was dead. It is so long ago that I am not\ncertain, but I think the mother never recovered, but died in two or\nthree weeks after.\n\nThis was an extraordinary case, and I am therefore the more particular\nin it, because I came so much to the knowledge of it; but there were\ninnumerable such-like cases, and it was seldom that the weekly bill came\nin but there were two or three put in, 'frighted'; that is, that may\nwell be called frighted to death. But besides those who were so frighted\nas to die upon the spot, there were great numbers frighted to other\nextremes, some frighted out of their senses, some out of their memory,\nand some out of their understanding. But I return to the shutting up of\nhouses.\n\nAs several people, I say, got out of their houses by stratagem after\nthey were shut up, so others got out by bribing the watchmen, and giving\nthem money to let them go privately out in the night. I must confess I\nthought it at that time the most innocent corruption or bribery that any\nman could be guilty of, and therefore could not but pity the poor men,\nand think it was hard when three of those watchmen were publicly whipped\nthrough the streets for suffering people to go out of houses shut up.\n\nBut notwithstanding that severity, money prevailed with the poor men,\nand many families found means to make sallies out, and escape that way\nafter they had been shut up; but these were generally such as had some\nplaces to retire to; and though there was no easy passing the roads any\nwhither after the 1st of August, yet there were many ways of retreat,\nand particularly, as I hinted, some got tents and set them up in the\nfields, carrying beds or straw to lie on, and provisions to eat, and so\nlived in them as hermits in a cell, for nobody would venture to come\nnear them; and several stories were told of such, some comical, some\ntragical, some who lived like wandering pilgrims in the deserts, and\nescaped by making themselves exiles in such a manner as is scarce to be\ncredited, and who yet enjoyed more liberty than was to be expected in\nsuch cases.\n\nI have by me a story of two brothers and their kinsman, who being single\nmen, but that had stayed in the city too long to get away, and indeed\nnot knowing where to go to have any retreat, nor having wherewith to\ntravel far, took a course for their own preservation, which though in\nitself at first desperate, yet was so natural that it may be wondered\nthat no more did so at that time. They were but of mean condition, and\nyet not so very poor as that they could not furnish themselves with some\nlittle conveniences such as might serve to keep life and soul together;\nand finding the distemper increasing in a terrible manner, they resolved\nto shift as well as they could, and to be gone.\n\nOne of them had been a soldier in the late wars, and before that in the\nLow Countries, and having been bred to no particular employment but his\narms, and besides being wounded, and not able to work very hard, had for\nsome time been employed at a baker's of sea-biscuit in Wapping.\n\nThe brother of this man was a seaman too, but somehow or other had been\nhurt of one leg, that he could not go to sea, but had worked for his\nliving at a sailmaker's in Wapping, or thereabouts; and being a good\nhusband, had laid up some money, and was the richest of the three.\n\nThe third man was a joiner or carpenter by trade, a handy fellow, and he\nhad no wealth but his box or basket of tools, with the help of which he\ncould at any time get his living, such a time as this excepted, wherever\nhe went--and he lived near Shadwell.\n\nThey all lived in Stepney parish, which, as I have said, being the last\nthat was infected, or at least violently, they stayed there till they\nevidently saw the plague was abating at the west part of the town, and\ncoming towards the east, where they lived.\n\nThe story of those three men, if the reader will be content to have me\ngive it in their own persons, without taking upon me to either vouch the\nparticulars or answer for any mistakes, I shall give as distinctly as I\ncan, believing the history will be a very good pattern for any poor man\nto follow, in case the like public desolation should happen here; and if\nthere may be no such occasion, which God of His infinite mercy grant us,\nstill the story may have its uses so many ways as that it will, I hope,\nnever be said that the relating has been unprofitable.\n\nI say all this previous to the history, having yet, for the present,\nmuch more to say before I quit my own part.\n\nI went all the first part of the time freely about the streets, though\nnot so freely as to run myself into apparent danger, except when they\ndug the great pit in the churchyard of our parish of Aldgate. A terrible\npit it was, and I could not resist my curiosity to go and see it. As\nnear as I may judge, it was about forty feet in length, and about\nfifteen or sixteen feet broad, and at the time I first looked at it,\nabout nine feet deep; but it was said they dug it near twenty feet deep\nafterwards in one part of it, till they could go no deeper for the\nwater; for they had, it seems, dug several large pits before this. For\nthough the plague was long a-coming to our parish, yet, when it did\ncome, there was no parish in or about London where it raged with such\nviolence as in the two parishes of Aldgate and Whitechappel.\n\nI say they had dug several pits in another ground, when the distemper\nbegan to spread in our parish, and especially when the dead-carts began\nto go about, which was not, in our parish, till the beginning of August.\nInto these pits they had put perhaps fifty or sixty bodies each; then\nthey made larger holes wherein they buried all that the cart brought in\na week, which, by the middle to the end of August, came to from 200 to\n400 a week; and they could not well dig them larger, because of the\norder of the magistrates confining them to leave no bodies within six\nfeet of the surface; and the water coming on at about seventeen or\neighteen feet, they could not well, I say, put more in one pit. But now,\nat the beginning of September, the plague raging in a dreadful manner,\nand the number of burials in our parish increasing to more than was ever\nburied in any parish about London of no larger extent, they ordered this\ndreadful gulf to be dug--for such it was, rather than a pit.\n\nThey had supposed this pit would have supplied them for a month or more\nwhen they dug it, and some blamed the churchwardens for suffering such a\nfrightful thing, telling them they were making preparations to bury the\nwhole parish, and the like; but time made it appear the churchwardens\nknew the condition of the parish better than they did: for, the pit\nbeing finished the 4th of September, I think, they began to bury in it\nthe 6th, and by the 20th, which was just two weeks, they had thrown into\nit 1114 bodies when they were obliged to fill it up, the bodies being\nthen come to lie within six feet of the surface. I doubt not but there\nmay be some ancient persons alive in the parish who can justify the fact\nof this, and are able to show even in what place of the churchyard the\npit lay better than I can. The mark of it also was many years to be seen\nin the churchyard on the surface, lying in length parallel with the\npassage which goes by the west wall of the churchyard out of\nHoundsditch, and turns east again into Whitechappel, coming out near the\nThree Nuns' Inn.\n\nIt was about the 10th of September that my curiosity led, or rather\ndrove, me to go and see this pit again, when there had been near 400\npeople buried in it; and I was not content to see it in the day-time, as\nI had done before, for then there would have been nothing to have been\nseen but the loose earth; for all the bodies that were thrown in were\nimmediately covered with earth by those they called the buriers, which\nat other times were called bearers; but I resolved to go in the night\nand see some of them thrown in.\n\nThere was a strict order to prevent people coming to those pits, and\nthat was only to prevent infection. But after some time that order was\nmore necessary, for people that were infected and near their end, and\ndelirious also, would run to those pits, wrapt in blankets or rugs, and\nthrow themselves in, and, as they said, bury themselves. I cannot say\nthat the officers suffered any willingly to lie there; but I have heard\nthat in a great pit in Finsbury, in the parish of Cripplegate, it lying\nopen then to the fields, for it was not then walled about, [many] came\nand threw themselves in, and expired there, before they threw any earth\nupon them; and that when they came to bury others and found them there,\nthey were quite dead, though not cold.\n\nThis may serve a little to describe the dreadful condition of that day,\nthough it is impossible to say anything that is able to give a true idea\nof it to those who did not see it, other than this, that it was indeed\nvery, very, very dreadful, and such as no tongue can express.\n\nI got admittance into the churchyard by being acquainted with the sexton\nwho attended; who, though he did not refuse me at all, yet earnestly\npersuaded me not to go, telling me very seriously (for he was a good,\nreligious, and sensible man) that it was indeed their business and duty\nto venture, and to run all hazards, and that in it they might hope to be\npreserved; but that I had no apparent call to it but my own curiosity,\nwhich, he said, he believed I would not pretend was sufficient to\njustify my running that hazard. I told him I had been pressed in my mind\nto go, and that perhaps it might be an instructing sight, that might not\nbe without its uses. 'Nay,' says the good man, 'if you will venture upon\nthat score, name of God go in; for, depend upon it, 'twill be a sermon\nto you, it may be, the best that ever you heard in your life. 'Tis a\nspeaking sight,' says he, 'and has a voice with it, and a loud one, to\ncall us all to repentance'; and with that he opened the door and said,\n'Go, if you will.'\n\nHis discourse had shocked my resolution a little, and I stood wavering\nfor a good while, but just at that interval I saw two links come over\nfrom the end of the Minories, and heard the bellman, and then appeared a\ndead-cart, as they called it, coming over the streets; so I could no\nlonger resist my desire of seeing it, and went in. There was nobody, as\nI could perceive at first, in the churchyard, or going into it, but the\nburiers and the fellow that drove the cart, or rather led the horse and\ncart; but when they came up to the pit they saw a man go to and again,\nmuffled up in a brown Cloak, and making motions with his hands under his\ncloak, as if he was in great agony, and the buriers immediately gathered\nabout him, supposing he was one of those poor delirious or desperate\ncreatures that used to pretend, as I have said, to bury themselves. He\nsaid nothing as he walked about, but two or three times groaned very\ndeeply and loud, and sighed as he would break his heart.\n\nWhen the buriers came up to him they soon found he was neither a person\ninfected and desperate, as I have observed above, or a person\ndistempered--in mind, but one oppressed with a dreadful weight of grief\nindeed, having his wife and several of his children all in the cart that\nwas just come in with him, and he followed in an agony and excess of\nsorrow. He mourned heartily, as it was easy to see, but with a kind of\nmasculine grief that could not give itself vent by tears; and calmly\ndefying the buriers to let him alone, said he would only see the bodies\nthrown in and go away, so they left importuning him. But no sooner was\nthe cart turned round and the bodies shot into the pit promiscuously,\nwhich was a surprise to him, for he at least expected they would have\nbeen decently laid in, though indeed he was afterwards convinced that\nwas impracticable; I say, no sooner did he see the sight but he cried\nout aloud, unable to contain himself. I could not hear what he said, but\nhe went backward two or three steps and fell down in a swoon. The\nburiers ran to him and took him up, and in a little while he came to\nhimself, and they led him away to the Pie Tavern over against the end of\nHoundsditch, where, it seems, the man was known, and where they took\ncare of him. He looked into the pit again as he went away, but the\nburiers had covered the bodies so immediately with throwing in earth,\nthat though there was light enough, for there were lanterns, and candles\nin them, placed all night round the sides of the pit, upon heaps of\nearth, seven or eight, or perhaps more, yet nothing could be seen.\n\nThis was a mournful scene indeed, and affected me almost as much as the\nrest; but the other was awful and full of terror. The cart had in it\nsixteen or seventeen bodies; some were wrapt up in linen sheets, some in\nrags, some little other than naked, or so loose that what covering they\nhad fell from them in the shooting out of the cart, and they fell quite\nnaked among the rest; but the matter was not much to them, or the\nindecency much to any one else, seeing they were all dead, and were to\nbe huddled together into the common grave of mankind, as we may call it,\nfor here was no difference made, but poor and rich went together; there\nwas no other way of burials, neither was it possible there should, for\ncoffins were not to be had for the prodigious numbers that fell in such\na calamity as this.\n\nIt was reported by way of scandal upon the buriers, that if any corpse\nwas delivered to them decently wound up, as we called it then, in a\nwinding-sheet tied over the head and feet, which some did, and which was\ngenerally of good linen; I say, it was reported that the buriers were so\nwicked as to strip them in the cart and carry them quite naked to the\nground. But as I cannot easily credit anything so vile among Christians,\nand at a time so filled with terrors as that was, I can only relate it\nand leave it undetermined.\n\nInnumerable stories also went about of the cruel behaviours and\npractices of nurses who tended the sick, and of their hastening on the\nfate of those they tended in their sickness. But I shall say more of\nthis in its place.\n\nI was indeed shocked with this sight; it almost overwhelmed me, and I\nwent away with my heart most afflicted, and full of the afflicting\nthoughts, such as I cannot describe just at my going out of the church,\nand turning up the street towards my own house, I saw another cart with\nlinks, and a bellman going before, coming out of Harrow Alley in the\nButcher Row, on the other side of the way, and being, as I perceived,\nvery full of dead bodies, it went directly over the street also toward\nthe church. I stood a while, but I had no stomach to go back again to\nsee the same dismal scene over again, so I went directly home, where I\ncould not but consider with thankfulness the risk I had run, believing I\nhad gotten no injury, as indeed I had not.\n\nHere the poor unhappy gentleman's grief came into my head again, and\nindeed I could not but shed tears in the reflection upon it, perhaps\nmore than he did himself; but his case lay so heavy upon my mind that I\ncould not prevail with myself, but that I must go out again into the\nstreet, and go to the Pie Tavern, resolving to inquire what became of\nhim.\n\nIt was by this time one o'clock in the morning, and yet the poor\ngentleman was there. The truth was, the people of the house, knowing\nhim, had entertained him, and kept him there all the night,\nnotwithstanding the danger of being infected by him, though it appeared\nthe man was perfectly sound himself.\n\nIt is with regret that I take notice of this tavern. The people were\ncivil, mannerly, and an obliging sort of folks enough, and had till this\ntime kept their house open and their trade going on, though not so very\npublicly as formerly: but there was a dreadful set of fellows that used\ntheir house, and who, in the middle of all this horror, met there every\nnight, behaved with all the revelling and roaring extravagances as is\nusual for such people to do at other times, and, indeed, to such an\noffensive degree that the very master and mistress of the house grew\nfirst ashamed and then terrified at them.\n\nThey sat generally in a room next the street, and as they always kept\nlate hours, so when the dead-cart came across the street-end to go into\nHoundsditch, which was in view of the tavern windows, they would\nfrequently open the windows as soon as they heard the bell and look out\nat them; and as they might often hear sad lamentations of people in the\nstreets or at their windows as the carts went along, they would make\ntheir impudent mocks and jeers at them, especially if they heard the\npoor people call upon God to have mercy upon them, as many would do at\nthose times in their ordinary passing along the streets.\n\nThese gentlemen, being something disturbed with the clutter of bringing\nthe poor gentleman into the house, as above, were first angry and very\nhigh with the master of the house for suffering such a fellow, as they\ncalled him, to be brought out of the grave into their house; but being\nanswered that the man was a neighbour, and that he was sound, but\noverwhelmed with the calamity of his family, and the like, they turned\ntheir anger into ridiculing the man and his sorrow for his wife and\nchildren, taunted him with want of courage to leap into the great pit\nand go to heaven, as they jeeringly expressed it, along with them,\nadding some very profane and even blasphemous expressions.\n\nThey were at this vile work when I came back to the house, and, as far\nas I could see, though the man sat still, mute and disconsolate, and\ntheir affronts could not divert his sorrow, yet he was both grieved and\noffended at their discourse. Upon this I gently reproved them, being\nwell enough acquainted with their characters, and not unknown in person\nto two of them.\n\nThey immediately fell upon me with ill language and oaths, asked me what\nI did out of my grave at such a time when so many honester men were\ncarried into the churchyard, and why I was not at home saying my prayers\nagainst the dead-cart came for me, and the like.\n\nI was indeed astonished at the impudence of the men, though not at all\ndiscomposed at their treatment of me. However, I kept my temper. I told\nthem that though I defied them or any man in the world to tax me with\nany dishonesty, yet I acknowledged that in this terrible judgement of\nGod many better than I were swept away and carried to their grave. But\nto answer their question directly, the case was, that I was mercifully\npreserved by that great God whose name they had blasphemed and taken in\nvain by cursing and swearing in a dreadful manner, and that I believed I\nwas preserved in particular, among other ends of His goodness, that I\nmight reprove them for their audacious boldness in behaving in such a\nmanner and in such an awful time as this was, especially for their\njeering and mocking at an honest gentleman and a neighbour (for some of\nthem knew him), who, they saw, was overwhelmed with sorrow for the\nbreaches which it had pleased God to make upon his family.\n\nI cannot call exactly to mind the hellish, abominable raillery which was\nthe return they made to that talk of mine: being provoked, it seems,\nthat I was not at all afraid to be free with them; nor, if I could\nremember, would I fill my account with any of the words, the horrid\noaths, curses, and vile expressions, such as, at that time of the day,\neven the worst and ordinariest people in the street would not use; for,\nexcept such hardened creatures as these, the most wicked wretches that\ncould be found had at that time some terror upon their minds of the hand\nof that Power which could thus in a moment destroy them.\n\nBut that which was the worst in all their devilish language was, that\nthey were not afraid to blaspheme God and talk atheistically, making a\njest of my calling the plague the hand of God; mocking, and even\nlaughing, at the word judgement, as if the providence of God had no\nconcern in the inflicting such a desolating stroke; and that the people\ncalling upon God as they saw the carts carrying away the dead bodies was\nall enthusiastic, absurd, and impertinent.\n\nI made them some reply, such as I thought proper, but which I found was\nso far from putting a check to their horrid way of speaking that it made\nthem rail the more, so that I confess it filled me with horror and a\nkind of rage, and I came away, as I told them, lest the hand of that\njudgement which had visited the whole city should glorify His vengeance\nupon them, and all that were near them.\n\nThey received all reproof with the utmost contempt, and made the\ngreatest mockery that was possible for them to do at me, giving me all\nthe opprobrious, insolent scoffs that they could think of for preaching\nto them, as they called it, which indeed grieved me, rather than angered\nme; and I went away, blessing God, however, in my mind that I had not\nspared them, though they had insulted me so much.\n\nThey continued this wretched course three or four days after this,\ncontinually mocking and jeering at all that showed themselves religious\nor serious, or that were any way touched with the sense of the terrible\njudgement of God upon us; and I was informed they flouted in the same\nmanner at the good people who, notwithstanding the contagion, met at the\nchurch, fasted, and prayed to God to remove His hand from them.\n\nI say, they continued this dreadful course three or four days--I think\nit was no more--when one of them, particularly he who asked the poor\ngentleman what he did out of his grave, was struck from Heaven with the\nplague, and died in a most deplorable manner; and, in a word, they were\nevery one of them carried into the great pit which I have mentioned\nabove, before it was quite filled up, which was not above a fortnight or\nthereabout.\n\nThese men were guilty of many extravagances, such as one would think\nhuman nature should have trembled at the thoughts of at such a time of\ngeneral terror as was then upon us, and particularly scoffing and\nmocking at everything which they happened to see that was religious\namong the people, especially at their thronging zealously to the place\nof public worship to implore mercy from Heaven in such a time of\ndistress; and this tavern where they held their dub being within view of\nthe church-door, they had the more particular occasion for their\natheistical profane mirth.\n\nBut this began to abate a little with them before the accident which I\nhave related happened, for the infection increased so violently at this\npart of the town now, that people began to be afraid to come to the\nchurch; at least such numbers did not resort thither as was usual. Many\nof the clergymen likewise were dead, and others gone into the country;\nfor it really required a steady courage and a strong faith for a man not\nonly to venture being in town at such a time as this, but likewise to\nventure to come to church and perform the office of a minister to a\ncongregation, of whom he had reason to believe many of them were\nactually infected with the plague, and to do this every day, or twice a\nday, as in some places was done.\n\nIt is true the people showed an extraordinary zeal in these religious\nexercises, and as the church-doors were always open, people would go in\nsingle at all times, whether the minister was officiating or no, and\nlocking themselves into separate pews, would be praying to God with\ngreat fervency and devotion.\n\nOthers assembled at meeting-houses, every one as their different\nopinions in such things guided, but all were promiscuously the subject\nof these men's drollery, especially at the beginning of the visitation.\n\nIt seems they had been checked for their open insulting religion in this\nmanner by several good people of every persuasion, and that, and the\nviolent raging of the infection, I suppose, was the occasion that they\nhad abated much of their rudeness for some time before, and were only\nroused by the spirit of ribaldry and atheism at the clamour which was\nmade when the gentleman was first brought in there, and perhaps were\nagitated by the same devil, when I took upon me to reprove them; though\nI did it at first with all the calmness, temper, and good manners that I\ncould, which for a while they insulted me the more for thinking it had\nbeen in fear of their resentment, though afterwards they found the\ncontrary.\n\nI went home, indeed, grieved and afflicted in my mind at the abominable\nwickedness of those men, not doubting, however, that they would be made\ndreadful examples of God's justice; for I looked upon this dismal time\nto be a particular season of Divine vengeance, and that God would on\nthis occasion single out the proper objects of His displeasure in a more\nespecial and remarkable manner than at another time; and that though I\ndid believe that many good people would, and did, fall in the common\ncalamity, and that it was no certain rule to judge of the eternal state\nof any one by their being distinguished in such a time of general\ndestruction neither one way or other; yet, I say, it could not but seem\nreasonable to believe that God would not think fit to spare by His mercy\nsuch open declared enemies, that should insult His name and Being, defy\nHis vengeance, and mock at His worship and worshippers at such a time;\nno, not though His mercy had thought fit to bear with and spare them at\nother times; that this was a day of visitation, a day of God's anger,\nand those words came into my thought, Jer. v. 9: 'Shall I not visit for\nthese things? saith the Lord: and shall not My soul be avenged of such a\nnation as this?'\n\nThese things, I say, lay upon my mind, and I went home very much grieved\nand oppressed with the horror of these men's wickedness, and to think\nthat anything could be so vile, so hardened, and notoriously wicked as\nto insult God, and His servants, and His worship in such a manner, and\nat such a time as this was, when He had, as it were, His sword drawn in\nHis hand on purpose to take vengeance not on them only, but on the whole\nnation.\n\nI had, indeed, been in some passion at first with them--though it was\nreally raised, not by any affront they had offered me personally, but by\nthe horror their blaspheming tongues filled me with. However, I was\ndoubtful in my thoughts whether the resentment I retained was not all\nupon my own private account, for they had given me a great deal of ill\nlanguage too--I mean personally; but after some pause, and having a\nweight of grief upon my mind, I retired myself as soon as I came home,\nfor I slept not that night; and giving God most humble thanks for my\npreservation in the eminent danger I had been in, I set my mind\nseriously and with the utmost earnestness to pray for those desperate\nwretches, that God would pardon them, open their eyes, and effectually\nhumble them.\n\nBy this I not only did my duty, namely, to pray for those who\ndespitefully used me, but I fully tried my own heart, to my full\nsatisfaction, that it was not filled with any spirit of resentment as\nthey had offended me in particular; and I humbly recommend the method to\nall those that would know, or be certain, how to distinguish between\ntheir zeal for the honour of God and the effects of their private\npassions and resentment.\n\nBut I must go back here to the particular incidents which occur to my\nthoughts of the time of the visitation, and particularly to the time of\ntheir shutting up houses in the first part of their sickness; for before\nthe sickness was come to its height people had more room to make their\nobservations than they had afterward; but when it was in the extremity\nthere was no such thing as communication with one another, as before.\n\nDuring the shutting up of houses, as I have said, some violence was\noffered to the watchmen. As to soldiers, there were none to be found.\nThe few guards which the king then had, which were nothing like the\nnumber entertained since, were dispersed, either at Oxford with the\nCourt, or in quarters in the remoter parts of the country, small\ndetachments excepted, who did duty at the Tower and at Whitehall, and\nthese but very few. Neither am I positive that there was any other guard\nat the Tower than the warders, as they called them, who stand at the\ngate with gowns and caps, the same as the yeomen of the guard, except\nthe ordinary gunners, who were twenty-four, and the officers appointed\nto look after the magazine, who were called armourers. As to trained\nbands, there was no possibility of raising any; neither, if the\nLieutenancy, either of London or Middlesex, had ordered the drums to\nbeat for the militia, would any of the companies, I believe, have drawn\ntogether, whatever risk they had run.\n\nThis made the watchmen be the less regarded, and perhaps occasioned the\ngreater violence to be used against them. I mention it on this score to\nobserve that the setting watchmen thus to keep the people in was, first\nof all, not effectual, but that the people broke out, whether by force\nor by stratagem, even almost as often as they pleased; and, second, that\nthose that did thus break out were generally people infected who, in\ntheir desperation, running about from one place to another, valued not\nwhom they injured: and which perhaps, as I have said, might give birth\nto report that it was natural to the infected people to desire to infect\nothers, which report was really false.\n\nAnd I know it so well, and in so many several cases, that I could give\nseveral relations of good, pious, and religious people who, when they\nhave had the distemper, have been so far from being forward to infect\nothers that they have forbid their own family to come near them, in\nhopes of their being preserved, and have even died without seeing their\nnearest relations lest they should be instrumental to give them the\ndistemper, and infect or endanger them. If, then, there were cases\nwherein the infected people were careless of the injury they did to\nothers, this was certainly one of them, if not the chief, namely, when\npeople who had the distemper had broken out from houses which were so\nshut up, and having been driven to extremities for provision or for\nentertainment, had endeavoured to conceal their condition, and have been\nthereby instrumental involuntarily to infect others who have been\nignorant and unwary.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why I believed then, and do believe still,\nthat the shutting up houses thus by force, and restraining, or rather\nimprisoning, people in their own houses, as I said above, was of little\nor no service in the whole. Nay, I am of opinion it was rather hurtful,\nhaving forced those desperate people to wander abroad with the plague\nupon them, who would otherwise have died quietly in their beds.\n\nI remember one citizen who, having thus broken out of his house in\nAldersgate Street or thereabout, went along the road to Islington; he\nattempted to have gone in at the Angel Inn, and after that the White\nHorse, two inns known still by the same signs, but was refused; after\nwhich he came to the Pied Bull, an inn also still continuing the same\nsign. He asked them for lodging for one night only, pretending to be\ngoing into Lincolnshire, and assuring them of his being very sound and\nfree from the infection, which also at that time had not reached much\nthat way.\n\nThey told him they had no lodging that they could spare but one bed up\nin the garret, and that they could spare that bed for one night, some\ndrovers being expected the next day with cattle; so, if he would accept\nof that lodging, he might have it, which he did. So a servant was sent\nup with a candle with him to show him the room. He was very well\ndressed, and looked like a person not used to lie in a garret; and when\nhe came to the room he fetched a deep sigh, and said to the servant, 'I\nhave seldom lain in such a lodging as this. 'However, the servant\nassuring him again that they had no better, 'Well,' says he, 'I must\nmake shift; this is a dreadful time; but it is but for one night.' So he\nsat down upon the bedside, and bade the maid, I think it was, fetch him\nup a pint of warm ale. Accordingly the servant went for the ale, but\nsome hurry in the house, which perhaps employed her other ways, put it\nout of her head, and she went up no more to him.\n\nThe next morning, seeing no appearance of the gentleman, somebody in the\nhouse asked the servant that had showed him upstairs what was become of\nhim. She started. 'Alas I,' says she, 'I never thought more of him. He\nbade me carry him some warm ale, but I forgot.' Upon which, not the\nmaid, but some other person was sent up to see after him, who, coming\ninto the room, found him stark dead and almost cold, stretched out\nacross the bed. His clothes were pulled off, his jaw fallen, his eyes\nopen in a most frightful posture, the rug of the bed being grasped hard\nin one of his hands, so that it was plain he died soon after the maid\nleft him; and 'tis probable, had she gone up with the ale, she had found\nhim dead in a few minutes after he sat down upon the bed. The alarm was\ngreat in the house, as anyone may suppose, they having been free from\nthe distemper till that disaster, which, bringing the infection to the\nhouse, spread it immediately to other houses round about it. I do not\nremember how many died in the house itself, but I think the maid-servant\nwho went up first with him fell presently ill by the fright, and several\nothers; for, whereas there died but two in Islington of the plague the\nweek before, there died seventeen the week after, whereof fourteen were\nof the plague. This was in the week from the 11th of July to the 18th.\n\nThere was one shift that some families had, and that not a few, when\ntheir houses happened to be infected, and that was this: the families\nwho, in the first breaking-out of the distemper, fled away into the\ncountry and had retreats among their friends, generally found some or\nother of their neighbours or relations to commit the charge of those\nhouses to for the safety of the goods and the like. Some houses were,\nindeed, entirely locked up, the doors padlocked, the windows and doors\nhaving deal boards nailed over them, and only the inspection of them\ncommitted to the ordinary watchmen and parish officers; but these were\nbut few.\n\nIt was thought that there were not less than 10,000 houses forsaken of\nthe inhabitants in the city and suburbs, including what was in the out-\nparishes and in Surrey, or the side of the water they called Southwark.\nThis was besides the numbers of lodgers, and of particular persons who\nwere fled out of other families; so that in all it was computed that\nabout 200,000 people were fled and gone. But of this I shall speak\nagain. But I mention it here on this account, namely, that it was a rule\nwith those who had thus two houses in their keeping or care, that if\nanybody was taken sick in a family, before the master of the family let\nthe examiners or any other officer know of it, he immediately would send\nall the rest of his family, whether children or servants, as it fell out\nto be, to such other house which he had so in charge, and then giving\nnotice of the sick person to the examiner, have a nurse or nurses\nappointed, and have another person to be shut up in the house with them\n(which many for money would do), so to take charge of the house in case\nthe person should die.\n\nThis was, in many cases, the saving a whole family, who, if they had\nbeen shut up with the sick person, would inevitably have perished. But,\non the other hand, this was another of the inconveniences of shutting up\nhouses; for the apprehensions and terror of being shut up made many run\naway with the rest of the family, who, though it was not publicly known,\nand they were not quite sick, had yet the distemper upon them; and who,\nby having an uninterrupted liberty to go about, but being obliged still\nto conceal their circumstances, or perhaps not knowing it themselves,\ngave the distemper to others, and spread the infection in a dreadful\nmanner, as I shall explain further hereafter.\n\nAnd here I may be able to make an observation or two of my own, which\nmay be of use hereafter to those into whose hands these may come, if\nthey should ever see the like dreadful visitation. (1) The infection\ngenerally came into the houses of the citizens by the means of their\nservants, whom they were obliged to send up and down the streets for\nnecessaries; that is to say, for food or physic, to bakehouses, brew-\nhouses, shops, &c.; and who going necessarily through the streets into\nshops, markets, and the like, it was impossible but that they should,\none way or other, meet with distempered people, who conveyed the fatal\nbreath into them, and they brought it home to the families to which they\nbelonged. (2) It was a great mistake that such a great city as this had\nbut one pest-house; for had there been, instead of one pest-house--viz.,\nbeyond Bunhill Fields, where, at most, they could receive, perhaps, two\nhundred or three hundred people--I say, had there, instead of that one,\nbeen several pest-houses, every one able to contain a thousand people,\nwithout lying two in a bed, or two beds in a room; and had every master\nof a family, as soon as any servant especially had been taken sick in\nhis house, been obliged to send them to the next pest-house, if they\nwere willing, as many were, and had the examiners done the like among\nthe poor people when any had been stricken with the infection; I say,\nhad this been done where the people were willing (not otherwise), and\nthe houses not been shut, I am persuaded, and was all the while of that\nopinion, that not so many, by several thousands, had died; for it was\nobserved, and I could give several instances within the compass of my\nown knowledge, where a servant had been taken sick, and the family had\neither time to send him out or retire from the house and leave the sick\nperson, as I have said above, they had all been preserved; whereas when,\nupon one or more sickening in a family, the house has been shut up, the\nwhole family have perished, and the bearers been obliged to go in to\nfetch out the dead bodies, not being able to bring them to the door, and\nat last none left to do it.\n\n(3) This put it out of question to me, that the calamity was spread by\ninfection; that is to say, by some certain steams or fumes, which the\nphysicians call effluvia, by the breath, or by the sweat, or by the\nstench of the sores of the sick persons, or some other way, perhaps,\nbeyond even the reach of the physicians themselves, which effluvia\naffected the sound who came within certain distances of the sick,\nimmediately penetrating the vital parts of the said sound persons,\nputting their blood into an immediate ferment, and agitating their\nspirits to that degree which it was found they were agitated; and so\nthose newly infected persons communicated it in the same manner to\nothers. And this I shall give some instances of, that cannot but\nconvince those who seriously consider it; and I cannot but with some\nwonder find some people, now the contagion is over, talk of its being an\nimmediate stroke from Heaven, without the agency of means, having\ncommission to strike this and that particular person, and none other--\nwhich I look upon with contempt as the effect of manifest ignorance and\nenthusiasm; likewise the opinion of others, who talk of infection being\ncarried on by the air only, by carrying with it vast numbers of insects\nand invisible creatures, who enter into the body with the breath, or\neven at the pores with the air, and there generate or emit most acute\npoisons, or poisonous ovae or eggs, which mingle themselves with the\nblood, and so infect the body: a discourse full of learned simplicity,\nand manifested to be so by universal experience; but I shall say more to\nthis case in its order.\n\nI must here take further notice that nothing was more fatal to the\ninhabitants of this city than the supine negligence of the people\nthemselves, who, during the long notice or warning they had of the\nvisitation, made no provision for it by laying in store of provisions,\nor of other necessaries, by which they might have lived retired and\nwithin their own houses, as I have observed others did, and who were in\na great measure preserved by that caution; nor were they, after they\nwere a little hardened to it, so shy of conversing with one another,\nwhen actually infected, as they were at first: no, though they knew it.\n\nI acknowledge I was one of those thoughtless ones that had made so\nlittle provision that my servants were obliged to go out of doors to buy\nevery trifle by penny and halfpenny, just as before it began, even till\nmy experience showing me the folly, I began to be wiser so late that I\nhad scarce time to store myself sufficient for our common subsistence\nfor a month.\n\nI had in family only an ancient woman that managed the house, a maid-\nservant, two apprentices, and myself; and the plague beginning to\nincrease about us, I had many sad thoughts about what course I should\ntake, and how I should act. The many dismal objects which happened\neverywhere as I went about the streets, had filled my mind with a great\ndeal of horror for fear of the distemper, which was indeed very horrible\nin itself, and in some more than in others. The swellings, which were\ngenerally in the neck or groin, when they grew hard and would not break,\ngrew so painful that it was equal to the most exquisite torture; and\nsome, not able to bear the torment, threw themselves out at windows or\nshot themselves, or otherwise made themselves away, and I saw several\ndismal objects of that kind. Others, unable to contain themselves,\nvented their pain by incessant roarings, and such loud and lamentable\ncries were to be heard as we walked along the streets that would pierce\nthe very heart to think of, especially when it was to be considered that\nthe same dreadful scourge might be expected every moment to seize upon\nourselves.\n\nI cannot say but that now I began to faint in my resolutions; my heart\nfailed me very much, and sorely I repented of my rashness. When I had\nbeen out, and met with such terrible things as these I have talked of, I\nsay I repented my rashness in venturing to abide in town. I wished often\nthat I had not taken upon me to stay, but had gone away with my brother\nand his family.\n\nTerrified by those frightful objects, I would retire home sometimes and\nresolve to go out no more; and perhaps I would keep those resolutions\nfor three or four days, which time I spent in the most serious\nthankfulness for my preservation and the preservation of my family, and\nthe constant confession of my sins, giving myself up to God every day,\nand applying to Him with fasting, humiliation, and meditation. Such\nintervals as I had I employed in reading books and in writing down my\nmemorandums of what occurred to me every day, and out of which\nafterwards I took most of this work, as it relates to my observations\nwithout doors. What I wrote of my private meditations I reserve for\nprivate use, and desire it may not be made public on any account\nwhatever.\n\nI also wrote other meditations upon divine subjects, such as occurred to\nme at that time and were profitable to myself, but not fit for any other\nview, and therefore I say no more of that.\n\nI had a very good friend, a physician, whose name was Heath, whom I\nfrequently visited during this dismal time, and to whose advice I was\nvery much obliged for many things which he directed me to take, by way\nof preventing the infection when I went out, as he found I frequently\ndid, and to hold in my mouth when I was in the streets. He also came\nvery often to see me, and as he was a good Christian as well as a good\nphysician, his agreeable conversation was a very great support to me in\nthe worst of this terrible time.\n\nIt was now the beginning of August, and the plague grew very violent and\nterrible in the place where I lived, and Dr Heath coming to visit me,\nand finding that I ventured so often out in the streets, earnestly\npersuaded me to lock myself up and my family, and not to suffer any of\nus to go out of doors; to keep all our windows fast, shutters and\ncurtains close, and never to open them; but first, to make a very strong\nsmoke in the room where the window or door was to be opened, with rozen\nand pitch, brimstone or gunpowder and the like; and we did this for some\ntime; but as I had not laid in a store of provision for such a retreat,\nit was impossible that we could keep within doors entirely. However, I\nattempted, though it was so very late, to do something towards it; and\nfirst, as I had convenience both for brewing and baking, I went and\nbought two sacks of meal, and for several weeks, having an oven, we\nbaked all our own bread; also I bought malt, and brewed as much beer as\nall the casks I had would hold, and which seemed enough to serve my\nhouse for five or six weeks; also I laid in a quantity of salt butter\nand Cheshire cheese; but I had no flesh-meat, and the plague raged so\nviolently among the butchers and slaughter-houses on the other side of\nour street, where they are known to dwell in great numbers, that it was\nnot advisable so much as to go over the street among them.\n\nAnd here I must observe again, that this necessity of going out of our\nhouses to buy provisions was in a great measure the ruin of the whole\ncity, for the people catched the distemper on these occasions one of\nanother, and even the provisions themselves were often tainted; at least\nI have great reason to believe so; and therefore I cannot say with\nsatisfaction what I know is repeated with great assurance, that the\nmarket-people and such as brought provisions to town were never\ninfected. I am certain the butchers of Whitechappel, where the greatest\npart of the flesh-meat was killed, were dreadfully visited, and that at\nleast to such a degree that few of their shops were kept open, and those\nthat remained of them killed their meat at Mile End and that way, and\nbrought it to market upon horses.\n\nHowever, the poor people could not lay up provisions, and there was a\nnecessity that they must go to market to buy, and others to send\nservants or their children; and as this was a necessity which renewed\nitself daily, it brought abundance of unsound people to the markets, and\na great many that went thither sound brought death home with them.\n\nIt is true people used all possible precaution. When any one bought a\njoint of meat in the market they would not take it off the butcher's\nhand, but took it off the hooks themselves. On the other hand, the\nbutcher would not touch the money, but have it put into a pot full of\nvinegar, which he kept for that purpose. The buyer carried always small\nmoney to make up any odd sum, that they might take no change. They\ncarried bottles of scents and perfumes in their hands, and all the means\nthat could be used were used, but then the poor could not do even these\nthings, and they went at all hazards.\n\nInnumerable dismal stories we heard every day on this very account.\nSometimes a man or woman dropped down dead in the very markets, for many\npeople that had the plague upon them knew nothing of it till the inward\ngangrene had affected their vitals, and they died in a few moments. This\ncaused that many died frequently in that manner in the streets suddenly,\nwithout any warning; others perhaps had time to go to the next bulk or\nstall, or to any door-porch, and just sit down and die, as I have said\nbefore.\n\nThese objects were so frequent in the streets that when the plague came\nto be very raging on one side, there was scarce any passing by the\nstreets but that several dead bodies would be lying here and there upon\nthe ground. On the other hand, it is observable that though at first the\npeople would stop as they went along and call to the neighbours to come\nout on such an occasion, yet afterward no notice was taken of them; but\nthat if at any time we found a corpse lying, go across the way and not\ncome near it; or, if in a narrow lane or passage, go back again and seek\nsome other way to go on the business we were upon; and in those cases\nthe corpse was always left till the officers had notice to come and take\nthem away, or till night, when the bearers attending the dead-cart would\ntake them up and carry them away. Nor did those undaunted creatures who\nperformed these offices fail to search their pockets, and sometimes\nstrip off their clothes if they were well dressed, as sometimes they\nwere, and carry off what they could get.\n\nBut to return to the markets. The butchers took that care that if any\nperson died in the market they had the officers always at band to take\nthem up upon hand-barrows and carry them to the next churchyard; and\nthis was so frequent that such were not entered in the weekly bill,\n'Found dead in the streets or fields', as is the case now, but they went\ninto the general articles of the great distemper.\n\nBut now the fury of the distemper increased to such a degree that even\nthe markets were but very thinly furnished with provisions or frequented\nwith buyers compared to what they were before; and the Lord Mayor caused\nthe country people who brought provisions to be stopped in the streets\nleading into the town, and to sit down there with their goods, where\nthey sold what they brought, and went immediately away; and this\nencouraged the country people greatly-to do so, for they sold their\nprovisions at the very entrances into the town, and even in the fields,\nas particularly in the fields beyond Whitechappel, in Spittlefields;\nalso in St George's Fields in Southwark, in Bunhill Fields, and in a\ngreat field called Wood's Close, near Islington. Thither the Lord Mayor,\naldermen, and magistrates sent their officers and servants to buy for\ntheir families, themselves keeping within doors as much as possible, and\nthe like did many other people; and after this method was taken the\ncountry people came with great cheerfulness, and brought provisions of\nall sorts, and very seldom got any harm, which, I suppose, added also to\nthat report of their being miraculously preserved.\n\nAs for my little family, having thus, as I have said, laid in a store of\nbread, butter, cheese, and beer, I took my friend and physician's\nadvice, and locked myself up, and my family, and resolved to suffer the\nhardship of living a few months without flesh-meat, rather than to\npurchase it at the hazard of our lives.\n\nBut though I confined my family, I could not prevail upon my unsatisfied\ncuriosity to stay within entirely myself; and though I generally came\nfrighted and terrified home, yet I could not restrain; only that indeed\nI did not do it so frequently as at first.\n\nI had some little obligations, indeed, upon me to go to my brother's\nhouse, which was in Coleman Street parish and which he had left to my\ncare, and I went at first every day, but afterwards only once or twice a\nweek.\n\nIn these walks I had many dismal scenes before my eyes, as particularly\nof persons falling dead in the streets, terrible shrieks and screechings\nof women, who, in their agonies, would throw open their chamber windows\nand cry out in a dismal, surprising manner. It is impossible to describe\nthe variety of postures in which the passions of the poor people would\nexpress themselves.\n\nPassing through Tokenhouse Yard, in Lothbury, of a sudden a casement\nviolently opened just over my head, and a woman gave three frightful\nscreeches, and then cried, 'Oh! death, death, death!' in a most\ninimitable tone, and which struck me with horror and a chillness in my\nvery blood. There was nobody to be seen in the whole street, neither did\nany other window open, for people had no curiosity now in any case, nor\ncould anybody help one another, so I went on to pass into Bell Alley.\n\nJust in Bell Alley, on the right hand of the passage, there was a more\nterrible cry than that, though it was not so directed out at the window;\nbut the whole family was in a terrible fright, and I could hear women\nand children run screaming about the rooms like distracted, when a\ngarret-window opened and somebody from a window on the other side the\nalley called and asked, 'What is the matter?' upon which, from the first\nwindow, it was answered, 'Oh Lord, my old master has hanged himself!'\nThe other asked again, 'Is he quite dead?' and the first answered, 'Ay,\nay, quite dead; quite dead and cold!' This person was a merchant and a\ndeputy alderman, and very rich. I care not to mention the name, though I\nknew his name too, but that would be an hardship to the family, which is\nnow flourishing again.\n\nBut this is but one; it is scarce credible what dreadful cases happened\nin particular families every day. People in the rage of the distemper,\nor in the torment of their swellings, which was indeed intolerable,\nrunning out of their own government, raving and distracted, and\noftentimes laying violent hands upon themselves, throwing themselves out\nat their windows, shooting themselves &c.; mothers murdering their own\nchildren in their lunacy, some dying of mere grief as a passion, some of\nmere fright and surprise without any infection at all, others frighted\ninto idiotism and foolish distractions, some into despair and lunacy,\nothers into melancholy madness.\n\nThe pain of the swelling was in particular very violent, and to some\nintolerable; the physicians and surgeons may be said to have tortured\nmany poor creatures even to death. The swellings in some grew hard, and\nthey applied violent drawing-plaisters or poultices to break them, and\nif these did not do they cut and scarified them in a terrible manner. In\nsome those swellings were made hard partly by the force of the distemper\nand partly by their being too violently drawn, and were so hard that no\ninstrument could cut them, and then they burnt them with caustics, so\nthat many died raving mad with the torment, and some in the very\noperation. In these distresses, some, for want of help to hold them down\nin their beds, or to look to them, laid hands upon themselves as above.\nSome broke out into the streets, perhaps naked, and would run directly\ndown to the river if they were not stopped by the watchman or other\nofficers, and plunge themselves into the water wherever they found it.\n\nIt often pierced my very soul to hear the groans and cries of those who\nwere thus tormented, but of the two this was counted the most promising\nparticular in the whole infection, for if these swellings could be\nbrought to a head, and to break and run, or, as the surgeons call it, to\ndigest, the patient generally recovered; whereas those who, like the\ngentlewoman's daughter, were struck with death at the beginning, and had\nthe tokens come out upon them, often went about indifferent easy till a\nlittle before they died, and some till the moment they dropped down, as\nin apoplexies and epilepsies is often the case. Such would be taken\nsuddenly very sick, and would run to a bench or bulk, or any convenient\nplace that offered itself, or to their own houses if possible, as I\nmentioned before, and there sit down, grow faint, and die. This kind of\ndying was much the same as it was with those who die of common\nmortifications, who die swooning, and, as it were, go away in a dream.\nSuch as died thus had very little notice of their being infected at all\ntill the gangrene was spread through their whole body; nor could\nphysicians themselves know certainly how it was with them till they\nopened their breasts or other parts of their body and saw the tokens.\n\nWe had at this time a great many frightful stories told us of nurses and\nwatchmen who looked after the dying people; that is to say, hired nurses\nwho attended infected people, using them barbarously, starving them,\nsmothering them, or by other wicked means hastening their end, that is\nto say, murdering of them; and watchmen, being set to guard houses that\nwere shut up when there has been but one person left, and perhaps that\none lying sick, that they have broke in and murdered that body, and\nimmediately thrown them out into the dead-cart! And so they have gone\nscarce cold to the grave.\n\nI cannot say but that some such murders were committed, and I think two\nwere sent to prison for it, but died before they could be tried; and I\nhave heard that three others, at several times, were excused for murders\nof that kind; but I must say I believe nothing of its being so common a\ncrime as some have since been pleased to say, nor did it seem to be so\nrational where the people were brought so low as not to be able to help\nthemselves, for such seldom recovered, and there was no temptation to\ncommit a murder, at least none equal to the fact, where they were sure\npersons would die in so short a time, and could not live.\n\nThat there were a great many robberies and wicked practices committed\neven in this dreadful time I do not deny. The power of avarice was so\nstrong in some that they would run any hazard to steal and to plunder;\nand particularly in houses where all the families or inhabitants have\nbeen dead and carried out, they would break in at all hazards, and\nwithout regard to the danger of infection, take even the clothes off the\ndead bodies and the bed-clothes from others where they lay dead.\n\nThis, I suppose, must be the case of a family in Houndsditch, where a\nman and his daughter, the rest of the family being, as I suppose,\ncarried away before by the dead-cart, were found stark naked, one in one\nchamber and one in another, lying dead on the floor, and the clothes of\nthe beds, from whence 'tis supposed they were rolled off by thieves,\nstolen and carried quite away.\n\nIt is indeed to be observed that the women were in all this calamity the\nmost rash, fearless, and desperate creatures, and as there were vast\nnumbers that went about as nurses to tend those that were sick, they\ncommitted a great many petty thieveries in the houses where they were\nemployed; and some of them were publicly whipped for it, when perhaps\nthey ought rather to have been hanged for examples, for numbers of\nhouses were robbed on these occasions, till at length the parish\nofficers were sent to recommend nurses to the sick, and always took an\naccount whom it was they sent, so as that they might call them to\naccount if the house had been abused where they were placed.\n\nBut these robberies extended chiefly to wearing-clothes, linen, and what\nrings or money they could come at when the person died who was under\ntheir care, but not to a general plunder of the houses; and I could give\nyou an account of one of these nurses, who, several years after, being\non her deathbed, confessed with the utmost horror the robberies she had\ncommitted at the time of her being a nurse, and by which she had\nenriched herself to a great degree. But as for murders, I do not find\nthat there was ever any proof of the facts in the manner as it has been\nreported, except as above.\n\nThey did tell me, indeed, of a nurse in one place that laid a wet cloth\nupon the face of a dying patient whom she tended, and so put an end to\nhis life, who was just expiring before; and another that smothered a\nyoung woman she was looking to when she was in a fainting fit, and would\nhave come to herself; some that killed them by giving them one thing,\nsome another, and some starved them by giving them nothing at all. But\nthese stories had two marks of suspicion that always attended them,\nwhich caused me always to slight them and to look on them as mere\nstories that people continually frighted one another with. First, that\nwherever it was that we heard it, they always placed the scene at the\nfarther end of the town, opposite or most remote from where you were to\nhear it. If you heard it in Whitechappel, it had happened at St Giles's,\nor at Westminster, or Holborn, or that end of the town. If you heard of\nit at that end of the town, then it was done in Whitechappel, or the\nMinories, or about Cripplegate parish. If you heard of it in the city,\nwhy, then it happened in Southwark; and if you heard of it in Southwark,\nthen it was done in the city, and the like.\n\nIn the next place, of what part soever you heard the story, the\nparticulars were always the same, especially that of laying a wet double\ncloth on a dying man's face, and that of smothering a young gentlewoman;\nso that it was apparent, at least to my judgement, that there was more\nof tale than of truth in those things.\n\nHowever, I cannot say but it had some effect upon the people, and\nparticularly that, as I said before, they grew more cautious whom they\ntook into their houses, and whom they trusted their lives with, and had\nthem always recommended if they could; and where they could not find\nsuch, for they were not very plenty, they applied to the parish\nofficers.\n\nBut here again the misery of that time lay upon the poor who, being\ninfected, had neither food or physic, neither physician or apothecary to\nassist them, or nurse to attend them. Many of those died calling for\nhelp, and even for sustenance, out at their windows in a most miserable\nand deplorable manner; but it must be added that whenever the cases of\nsuch persons or families were represented to my Lord Mayor they always\nwere relieved.\n\nIt is true, in some houses where the people were not very poor, yet\nwhere they had sent perhaps their wives and children away, and if they\nhad any servants they had been dismissed;--I say it is true that to save\nthe expenses, many such as these shut themselves in, and not having\nhelp, died alone.\n\nA neighbour and acquaintance of mine, having some money owing to him\nfrom a shopkeeper in Whitecross Street or thereabouts, sent his\napprentice, a youth about eighteen years of age, to endeavour to get the\nmoney. He came to the door, and finding it shut, knocked pretty hard;\nand, as he thought, heard somebody answer within, but was not sure, so\nhe waited, and after some stay knocked again, and then a third time,\nwhen he heard somebody coming downstairs.\n\nAt length the man of the house came to the door; he had on his breeches\nor drawers, and a yellow flannel waistcoat, no stockings, a pair of\nslipped-shoes, a white cap on his head, and, as the young man said,\n'death in his face'.\n\nWhen he opened the door, says he, 'What do you disturb me thus for?' The\nboy, though a little surprised, replied, 'I come from such a one, and my\nmaster sent me for the money which he says you know of.' 'Very well,\nchild,' returns the living ghost; 'call as you go by at Cripplegate\nChurch, and bid them ring the bell'; and with these words shut the door\nagain, and went up again, and died the same day; nay, perhaps the same\nhour. This the young man told me himself, and I have reason to believe\nit. This was while the plague was not come to a height. I think it was\nin June, towards the latter end of the month; it must be before the\ndead-carts came about, and while they used the ceremony of ringing the\nbell for the dead, which was over for certain, in that parish at least,\nbefore the month of July, for by the 25th of July there died 550 and\nupwards in a week, and then they could no more bury in form, rich or\npoor.\n\nI have mentioned above that notwithstanding this dreadful calamity, yet\nthe numbers of thieves were abroad upon all occasions, where they had\nfound any prey, and that these were generally women. It was one morning\nabout eleven O'clock, I had walked out to my brother's house in Coleman\nStreet parish, as I often did, to see that all was safe.\n\nMy brother's house had a little court before it, and a brick wall and a\ngate in it, and within that several warehouses where his goods of\nseveral sorts lay. It happened that in one of these warehouses were\nseveral packs of women's high-crowned hats, which came out of the\ncountry and were, as I suppose, for exportation: whither, I know not.\n\nI was surprised that when I came near my brother's door, which was in a\nplace they called Swan Alley, I met three or four women with high-\ncrowned hats on their heads; and, as I remembered afterwards, one, if\nnot more, had some hats likewise in their hands; but as I did not see\nthem come out at my brother's door, and not knowing that my brother had\nany such goods in his warehouse, I did not offer to say anything to\nthem, but went across the way to shun meeting them, as was usual to do\nat that time, for fear of the plague. But when I came nearer to the gate\nI met another woman with more hats come out of the gate. 'What business,\nmistress,' said I, 'have you had there?' 'There are more people there,'\nsaid she; 'I have had no more business there than they.' I was hasty to\nget to the gate then, and said no more to her, by which means she got\naway. But just as I came to the gate, I saw two more coming across the\nyard to come out with hats also on their heads and under their arms, at\nwhich I threw the gate to behind me, which having a spring lock fastened\nitself; and turning to the women, 'Forsooth,' said I, 'what are you\ndoing here?' and seized upon the hats, and took them from them. One of\nthem, who, I confess, did not look like a thief--'Indeed,' says she, 'we\nare wrong, but we were told they were goods that had no owner. Be\npleased to take them again; and look yonder, there are more such\ncustomers as we.' She cried and looked pitifully, so I took the hats\nfrom her and opened the gate, and bade them be gone, for I pitied the\nwomen indeed; but when I looked towards the warehouse, as she directed,\nthere were six or seven more, all women, fitting themselves with hats as\nunconcerned and quiet as if they had been at a hatter's shop buying for\ntheir money.\n\nI was surprised, not at the sight of so many thieves only, but at the\ncircumstances I was in; being now to thrust myself in among so many\npeople, who for some weeks had been so shy of myself that if I met\nanybody in the street I would cross the way from them.\n\nThey were equally surprised, though on another account. They all told me\nthey were neighbours, that they had heard anyone might take them, that\nthey were nobody's goods, and the like. I talked big to them at first,\nwent back to the gate and took out the key, so that they were all my\nprisoners, threatened to lock them all into the warehouse, and go and\nfetch my Lord Mayor's officers for them.\n\nThey begged heartily, protested they found the gate open, and the\nwarehouse door open; and that it had no doubt been broken open by some\nwho expected to find goods of greater value: which indeed was reasonable\nto believe, because the lock was broke, and a padlock that hung to the\ndoor on the outside also loose, and an abundance of the hats carried\naway.\n\nAt length I considered that this was not a time to be cruel and\nrigorous; and besides that, it would necessarily oblige me to go much\nabout, to have several people come to me, and I go to several whose\ncircumstances of health I knew nothing of; and that even at this time\nthe plague was so high as that there died 4000 a week; so that in\nshowing my resentment, or even in seeking justice for my brother's\ngoods, I might lose my own life; so I contented myself with taking the\nnames and places where some of them lived, who were really inhabitants\nin the neighbourhood, and threatening that my brother should call them\nto an account for it when he returned to his habitation.\n\nThen I talked a little upon another foot with them, and asked them how\nthey could do such things as these in a time of such general calamity,\nand, as it were, in the face of God's most dreadful judgements, when the\nplague was at their very doors, and, it may be, in their very houses,\nand they did not know but that the dead-cart might stop at their doors\nin a few hours to carry them to their graves.\n\nI could not perceive that my discourse made much impression upon them\nall that while, till it happened that there came two men of the\nneighbourhood, hearing of the disturbance, and knowing my brother, for\nthey had been both dependents upon his family, and they came to my\nassistance. These being, as I said, neighbours, presently knew three of\nthe women and told me who they were and where they lived; and it seems\nthey had given me a true account of themselves before.\n\nThis brings these two men to a further remembrance. The name of one was\nJohn Hayward, who was at that time undersexton of the parish of St\nStephen, Coleman Street. By undersexton was understood at that time\ngravedigger and bearer of the dead. This man carried, or assisted to\ncarry, all the dead to their graves which were buried in that large\nparish, and who were carried in form; and after that form of burying was\nstopped, went with the dead-cart and the bell to fetch the dead bodies\nfrom the houses where they lay, and fetched many of them out of the\nchambers and houses; for the parish was, and is still, remarkable\nparticularly, above all the parishes in London, for a great number of\nalleys and thoroughfares, very long, into which no carts could come, and\nwhere they were obliged to go and fetch the bodies a very long way;\nwhich alleys now remain to witness it, such as White's Alley, Cross Key\nCourt, Swan Alley, Bell Alley, White Horse Alley, and many more. Here\nthey went with a kind of hand-barrow and laid the dead bodies on it, and\ncarried them out to the carts; which work he performed and never had the\ndistemper at all, but lived about twenty years after it, and was sexton\nof the parish to the time of his death. His wife at the same time was a\nnurse to infected people, and tended many that died in the parish, being\nfor her honesty recommended by the parish officers; yet she never was\ninfected neither.\n\nHe never used any preservative against the infection, other than holding\ngarlic and rue in his mouth, and smoking tobacco. This I also had from\nhis own mouth. And his wife's remedy was washing her head in vinegar and\nsprinkling her head-clothes so with vinegar as to keep them always\nmoist, and if the smell of any of those she waited on was more than\nordinary offensive, she snuffed vinegar up her nose and sprinkled\nvinegar upon her head-clothes, and held a handkerchief wetted with\nvinegar to her mouth.\n\nIt must be confessed that though the plague was chiefly among the poor,\nyet were the poor the most venturous and fearless of it, and went about\ntheir employment with a sort of brutal courage; I must call it so, for\nit was founded neither on religion nor prudence; scarce did they use any\ncaution, but ran into any business which they could get employment in,\nthough it was the most hazardous. Such was that of tending the sick,\nwatching houses shut up, carrying infected persons to the pest-house,\nand, which was still worse, carrying the dead away to their graves.\n\nIt was under this John Hayward's care, and within his bounds, that the\nstory of the piper, with which people have made themselves so merry,\nhappened, and he assured me that it was true. It is said that it was a\nblind piper; but, as John told me, the fellow was not blind, but an\nignorant, weak, poor man, and usually walked his rounds about ten\no'clock at night and went piping along from door to door, and the people\nusually took him in at public-houses where they knew him, and would give\nhim drink and victuals, and sometimes farthings; and he in return would\npipe and sing and talk simply, which diverted the people; and thus he\nlived. It was but a very bad time for this diversion while things were\nas I have told, yet the poor fellow went about as usual, but was almost\nstarved; and when anybody asked how he did he would answer, the dead\ncart had not taken him yet, but that they had promised to call for him\nnext week.\n\nIt happened one night that this poor fellow, whether somebody had given\nhim too much drink or no--John Hayward said he had not drink in his\nhouse, but that they had given him a little more victuals than ordinary\nat a public-house in Coleman Street--and the poor fellow, having not\nusually had a bellyful for perhaps not a good while, was laid all along\nupon the top of a bulk or stall, and fast asleep, at a door in the\nstreet near London Wall, towards Cripplegate-, and that upon the same\nbulk or stall the people of some house, in the alley of which the house\nwas a corner, hearing a bell which they always rang before the cart\ncame, had laid a body really dead of the plague just by him, thinking,\ntoo, that this poor fellow had been a dead body, as the other was, and\nlaid there by some of the neighbours.\n\nAccordingly, when John Hayward with his bell and the cart came along,\nfinding two dead bodies lie upon the stall, they took them up with the\ninstrument they used and threw them into the cart, and, all this while\nthe piper slept soundly.\n\nFrom hence they passed along and took in other dead bodies, till, as\nhonest John Hayward told me, they almost buried him alive in the cart;\nyet all this while he slept soundly. At length the cart came to the\nplace where the bodies were to be thrown into the ground, which, as I do\nremember, was at Mount Mill; and as the cart usually stopped some time\nbefore they were ready to shoot out the melancholy load they had in it,\nas soon as the cart stopped the fellow awaked and struggled a little to\nget his head out from among the dead bodies, when, raising himself up in\nthe cart, he called out, 'Hey! where am I?' This frighted the fellow\nthat attended about the work; but after some pause John Hayward,\nrecovering himself, said, 'Lord, bless us! There's somebody in the cart\nnot quite dead!' So another called to him and said, 'Who are you?' The\nfellow answered, 'I am the poor piper. Where am I?' 'Where are you?'\nsays Hayward. 'Why, you are in the dead-cart, and we are going to bury\nyou.' 'But I an't dead though, am I?' says the piper, which made them\nlaugh a little though, as John said, they were heartily frighted at\nfirst; so they helped the poor fellow down, and he went about his\nbusiness.\n\nI know the story goes he set up his pipes in the cart and frighted the\nbearers and others so that they ran away; but John Hayward did not tell\nthe story so, nor say anything of his piping at all; but that he was a\npoor piper, and that he was carried away as above I am fully satisfied\nof the truth of.\n\nIt is to be noted here that the dead-carts in the city were not confined\nto particular parishes, but one cart went through several parishes,\naccording as the number of dead presented; nor were they tied to carry\nthe dead to their respective parishes, but many of the dead taken up in\nthe city were carried to the burying-ground in the out-parts for want of\nroom.\n\nI have already mentioned the surprise that this judgement was at first\namong the people. I must be allowed to give some of my observations on\nthe more serious and religious part. Surely never city, at least of this\nbulk and magnitude, was taken in a condition so perfectly unprepared for\nsuch a dreadful visitation, whether I am to speak of the civil\npreparations or religious. They were, indeed, as if they had had no\nwarning, no expectation, no apprehensions, and consequently the least\nprovision imaginable was made for it in a public way. For example, the\nLord Mayor and sheriffs had made no provision as magistrates for the\nregulations which were to be observed. They had gone into no measures\nfor relief of the poor. The citizens had no public magazines or\nstorehouses for corn or meal for the subsistence of the poor, which if\nthey had provided themselves, as in such cases is done abroad, many\nmiserable families who were now reduced to the utmost distress would\nhave been relieved, and that in a better manner than now could be done.\n\nThe stock of the city's money I can say but little to. The Chamber of\nLondon was said to be exceedingly rich, and it may be concluded that\nthey were so, by the vast of money issued from thence in the rebuilding\nthe public edifices after the fire of London, and in building new works,\nsuch as, for the first part, the Guildhall, Blackwell Hall, part of\nLeadenhall, half the Exchange, the Session House, the Compter, the\nprisons of Ludgate, Newgate, &c., several of the wharfs and stairs and\nlanding-places on the river; all which were either burned down or\ndamaged by the great fire of London, the next year after the plague; and\nof the second sort, the Monument, Fleet Ditch with its bridges, and the\nHospital of Bethlem or Bedlam, &c. But possibly the managers of the\ncity's credit at that time made more conscience of breaking in upon the\norphan's money to show charity to the distressed citizens than the\nmanagers in the following years did to beautify the city and re-edify\nthe buildings; though, in the first case, the losers would have thought\ntheir fortunes better bestowed, and the public faith of the city have\nbeen less subjected to scandal and reproach.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that the absent citizens, who, though they were\nfled for safety into the country, were yet greatly interested in the\nwelfare of those whom they left behind, forgot not to contribute\nliberally to the relief of the poor, and large sums were also collected\namong trading towns in the remotest parts of England; and, as I have\nheard also, the nobility and the gentry in all parts of England took the\ndeplorable condition of the city into their consideration, and sent up\nlarge sums of money in charity to the Lord Mayor and magistrates for the\nrelief of the poor. The king also, as I was told, ordered a thousand\npounds a week to be distributed in four parts: one quarter to the city\nand liberty of Westminster; one quarter or part among the inhabitants of\nthe Southwark side of the water; one quarter to the liberty and parts\nwithin of the city, exclusive of the city within the walls; and one-\nfourth part to the suburbs in the county of Middlesex, and the east and\nnorth parts of the city. But this latter I only speak of as a report.\n\nCertain it is, the greatest part of the poor or families who formerly\nlived by their labour, or by retail trade, lived now on charity; and had\nthere not been prodigious sums of money given by charitable, well-minded\nChristians for the support of such, the city could never have subsisted.\nThere were, no question, accounts kept of their charity, and of the just\ndistribution of it by the magistrates. But as such multitudes of those\nvery officers died through whose hands it was distributed, and also\nthat, as I have been told, most of the accounts of those things were\nlost in the great fire which happened in the very next year, and which\nburnt even the chamberlain's office and many of their papers, so I could\nnever come at the particular account, which I used great endeavours to\nhave seen.\n\nIt may, however, be a direction in case of the approach of a like\nvisitation, which God keep the city from;--I say, it may be of use to\nobserve that by the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen at that time in\ndistributing weekly great sums of money for relief of the poor, a\nmultitude of people who would otherwise have perished, were relieved,\nand their lives preserved. And here let me enter into a brief state of\nthe case of the poor at that time, and what way apprehended from them,\nfrom whence may be judged hereafter what may be expected if the like\ndistress should come upon the city.\n\nAt the beginning of the plague, when there was now no more hope but that\nthe whole city would be visited; when, as I have said, all that had\nfriends or estates in the country retired with their families; and when,\nindeed, one would have thought the very city itself was running out of\nthe gates, and that there would be nobody left behind; you may be sure\nfrom that hour all trade, except such as related to immediate\nsubsistence, was, as it were, at a full stop.\n\nThis is so lively a case, and contains in it so much of the real\ncondition of the people, that I think I cannot be too particular in it,\nand therefore I descend to the several arrangements or classes of people\nwho fell into immediate distress upon this occasion. For example:\n\n1. All master-workmen in manufactures, especially such as belonged to\nornament and the less necessary parts of the people's dress, clothes,\nand furniture for houses, such as riband-weavers and other weavers, gold\nand silver lace makers, and gold and silver wire drawers, sempstresses,\nmilliners, shoemakers, hatmakers, and glovemakers; also upholsterers,\njoiners, cabinet-makers, looking-glass makers, and innumerable trades\nwhich depend upon such as these;--I say, the master-workmen in such\nstopped their work, dismissed their journeymen and workmen, and all\ntheir dependents.\n\n2. As merchandising was at a full stop, for very few ships ventured to\ncome up the river and none at all went out, so all the extraordinary\nofficers of the customs, likewise the watermen, carmen, porters, and all\nthe poor whose labour depended upon the merchants, were at once\ndismissed and put out of business.\n\n3. All the tradesmen usually employed in building or repairing of houses\nwere at a full stop, for the people were far from wanting to build\nhouses when so many thousand houses were at once stripped of their\ninhabitants; so that this one article turned all the ordinary workmen of\nthat kind out of business, such as bricklayers, masons, carpenters,\njoiners, plasterers, painters, glaziers, smiths, plumbers, and all the\nlabourers depending on such.\n\n4. As navigation was at a stop, our ships neither coming in or going out\nas before, so the seamen were all out of employment, and many of them in\nthe last and lowest degree of distress; and with the seamen were all the\nseveral tradesmen and workmen belonging to and depending upon the\nbuilding and fitting out of ships, such as ship-carpenters, caulkers,\nropemakers, dry coopers, sailmakers, anchorsmiths, and other smiths;\nblockmakers, carvers, gunsmiths, ship-chandlers, ship-carvers, and the\nlike. The masters of those perhaps might live upon their substance, but\nthe traders were universally at a stop, and consequently all their\nworkmen discharged. Add to these that the river was in a manner without\nboats, and all or most part of the watermen, lightermen, boat-builders,\nand lighter-builders in like manner idle and laid by.\n\n5. All families retrenched their living as much as possible, as well\nthose that fled as those that stayed; so that an innumerable multitude\nof footmen, serving-men, shopkeepers, journeymen, merchants'\nbookkeepers, and such sort of people, and especially poor maid-servants,\nwere turned off, and left friendless and helpless, without employment\nand without habitation, and this was really a dismal article.\n\nI might be more particular as to this part, but it may suffice to\nmention in general, all trades being stopped, employment ceased: the\nlabour, and by that the bread, of the poor were cut off; and at first\nindeed the cries of the poor were most lamentable to hear, though by the\ndistribution of charity their misery that way was greatly abated. Many\nindeed fled into the counties, but thousands of them having stayed in\nLondon till nothing but desperation sent them away, death overtook them\non the road, and they served for no better than the messengers of death;\nindeed, others carrying the infection along with them, spread it very\nunhappily into the remotest parts of the kingdom.\n\nMany of these were the miserable objects of despair which I have\nmentioned before, and were removed by the destruction which followed.\nThese might be said to perish not by the infection itself but by the\nconsequence of it; indeed, namely, by hunger and distress and the want\nof all things: being without lodging, without money, without friends,\nwithout means to get their bread, or without anyone to give it them; for\nmany of them were without what we call legal settlements, and so could\nnot claim of the parishes, and all the support they had was by\napplication to the magistrates for relief, which relief was (to give the\nmagistrates their due) carefully and cheerfully administered as they\nfound it necessary, and those that stayed behind never felt the want and\ndistress of that kind which they felt who went away in the manner above\nnoted.\n\nLet any one who is acquainted with what multitudes of people get their\ndaily bread in this city by their labour, whether artificers or mere\nworkmen--I say, let any man consider what must be the miserable\ncondition of this town if, on a sudden, they should be all turned out of\nemployment, that labour should cease, and wages for work be no more.\n\nThis was the case with us at that time; and had not the sums of money\ncontributed in charity by well-disposed people of every kind, as well\nabroad as at home, been prodigiously great, it had not been in the power\nof the Lord Mayor and sheriffs to have kept the public peace. Nor were\nthey without apprehensions, as it was, that desperation should push the\npeople upon tumults, and cause them to rifle the houses of rich men and\nplunder the markets of provisions; in which case the country people, who\nbrought provisions very freely and boldly to town, would have been\nterrified from coming any more, and the town would have sunk under an\nunavoidable famine.\n\nBut the prudence of my Lord Mayor and the Court of Aldermen within the\ncity, and of the justices of peace in the out-parts, was such, and they\nwere supported with money from all parts so well, that the poor people\nwere kept quiet, and their wants everywhere relieved, as far as was\npossible to be done.\n\nTwo things besides this contributed to prevent the mob doing any\nmischief. One was, that really the rich themselves had not laid up\nstores of provisions in their houses as indeed they ought to have done,\nand which if they had been wise enough to have done, and locked\nthemselves entirely up, as some few did, they had perhaps escaped the\ndisease better. But as it appeared they had not, so the mob had no\nnotion of finding stores of provisions there if they had broken in as it\nis plain they were sometimes very near doing, and which: if they had,\nthey had finished the ruin of the whole city, for there were no regular\ntroops to have withstood them, nor could the trained bands have been\nbrought together to defend the city, no men being to be found to bear\narms.\n\nBut the vigilance of the Lord Mayor and such magistrates as could be had\n(for some, even of the aldermen, were dead, and some absent) prevented\nthis; and they did it by the most kind and gentle methods they could\nthink of, as particularly by relieving the most desperate with money,\nand putting others into business, and particularly that employment of\nwatching houses that were infected and shut up. And as the number of\nthese were very great (for it was said there was at one time ten\nthousand houses shut up, and every house had two watchmen to guard it,\nviz., one by night and the other by day), this gave opportunity to\nemploy a very great number of poor men at a time.\n\nThe women and servants that were turned off from their places were\nlikewise employed as nurses to tend the sick in all places, and this\ntook off a very great number of them.\n\nAnd, which though a melancholy article in itself, yet was a deliverance\nin its kind: namely, the plague, which raged in a dreadful manner from\nthe middle of August to the middle of October, carried off in that time\nthirty or forty thousand of these very people which, had they been left,\nwould certainly have been an insufferable burden by their poverty; that\nis to say, the whole city could not have supported the expense of them,\nor have provided food for them; and they would in time have been even\ndriven to the necessity of plundering either the city itself or the\ncountry adjacent, to have subsisted themselves, which would first or\nlast have put the whole nation, as well as the city, into the utmost\nterror and confusion.\n\nIt was observable, then, that this calamity of the people made them very\nhumble; for now for about nine weeks together there died near a thousand\na day, one day with another, even by the account of the weekly bills,\nwhich yet, I have reason to be assured, never gave a full account, by\nmany thousands; the confusion being such, and the carts working in the\ndark when they carried the dead, that in some places no account at all\nwas kept, but they worked on, the clerks and sextons not attending for\nweeks together, and not knowing what number they carried. This account\nis verified by the following bills of mortality:--\n\n\n     -                        Of all of the\n     -                        Diseases.

I observed often that in the parishes of Aldgate and\nCripplegate, Whitechappel and Stepney, there were five, six, seven, and\neight hundred in a week in the bills; whereas if we may believe the\nopinion of those that lived in the city all the time as well as I, there\ndied sometimes 2000 a week in those parishes; and I saw it under the\nhand of one that made as strict an examination into that part as he\ncould, that there really died an hundred thousand people of the plague\nin that one year whereas in the bills, the articles of the plague, it\nwas but 68,590.\n\nIf I may be allowed to give my opinion, by what I saw with my eyes and\nheard from other people that were eye-witnesses, I do verily believe the\nsame, viz., that there died at least 100,000 of the plague only, besides\nother distempers and besides those which died in the fields and highways\nand secret Places out of the compass of the communication, as it was\ncalled, and who were not put down in the bills though they really\nbelonged to the body of the inhabitants. It was known to us all that\nabundance of poor despairing creatures who had the distemper upon them,\nand were grown stupid or melancholy by their misery, as many were,\nwandered away into the fields and Woods, and into secret uncouth places\nalmost anywhere, to creep into a bush or hedge and die.\n\nThe inhabitants of the villages adjacent would, in pity, carry them food\nand set it at a distance, that they might fetch it, if they were able;\nand sometimes they were not able, and the next time they went they\nshould find the poor wretches lie dead and the food untouched. The\nnumber of these miserable objects were many, and I know so many that\nperished thus, and so exactly where, that I believe I could go to the\nvery place and dig their bones up still; for the country people would go\nand dig a hole at a distance from them, and then with long poles, and\nhooks at the end of them, drag the bodies into these pits, and then\nthrow the earth in from as far as they could cast it, to cover them,\ntaking notice how the wind blew, and so coming on that side which the\nseamen call to windward, that the scent of the bodies might blow from\nthem; and thus great numbers went out of the world who were never known,\nor any account of them taken, as well within the bills of mortality as\nwithout.\n\nThis, indeed, I had in the main only from the relation of others, for I\nseldom walked into the fields, except towards Bethnal Green and Hackney,\nor as hereafter. But when I did walk, I always saw a great many poor\nwanderers at a distance; but I could know little of their cases, for\nwhether it were in the street or in the fields, if we had seen anybody\ncoming, it was a general method to walk away; yet I believe the account\nis exactly true.\n\nAs this puts me upon mentioning my walking the streets and fields, I\ncannot omit taking notice what a desolate place the city was at that\ntime. The great street I lived in (which is known to be one of the\nbroadest of all the streets of London, I mean of the suburbs as well as\nthe liberties) all the side where the butchers lived, especially without\nthe bars, was more like a green field than a paved street, and the\npeople generally went in the middle with the horses and carts. It is\ntrue that the farthest end towards Whitechappel Church was not all\npaved, but even the part that was paved was full of grass also; but this\nneed not seem strange, since the great streets within the city, such as\nLeadenhall Street, Bishopsgate Street, Cornhill, and even the Exchange\nitself, had grass growing in them in several places; neither cart or\ncoach were seen in the streets from morning to evening, except some\ncountry carts to bring roots and beans, or peas, hay, and straw, to the\nmarket, and those but very few compared to what was usual. As for\ncoaches, they were scarce used but to carry sick people to the pest-\nhouse, and to other hospitals, and some few to carry physicians to such\nplaces as they thought fit to venture to visit; for really coaches were\ndangerous things, and people did not care to venture into them, because\nthey did not know who might have been carried in them last, and sick,\ninfected people were, as I have said, ordinarily carried in them to the\npest-houses, and sometimes people expired in them as they went along.\n\nIt is true, when the infection came to such a height as I have now\nmentioned, there were very few physicians which cared to stir abroad to\nsick houses, and very many of the most eminent of the faculty were dead,\nas well as the surgeons also; for now it was indeed a dismal time, and\nfor about a month together, not taking any notice of the bills of\nmortality, I believe there did not die less than 1500 or 1700 a day, one\nday with another.\n\nOne of the worst days we had in the whole time, as I thought, was in the\nbeginning of September, when, indeed, good people began to think that\nGod was resolved to make a full end of the people in this miserable\ncity. This was at that time when the plague was fully come into the\neastern parishes. The parish of Aldgate, if I may give my opinion,\nburied above a thousand a week for two weeks, though the bills did not\nsay so many;--but it surrounded me at so dismal a rate that there was\nnot a house in twenty uninfected in the Minories, in Houndsditch, and in\nthose parts of Aldgate parish about the Butcher Row and the alleys over\nagainst me. I say, in those places death reigned in every corner.\nWhitechappel parish was in the same condition, and though much less than\nthe parish I lived in, yet buried near 600 a week by the bills, and in\nmy opinion near twice as many. Whole families, and indeed whole streets\nof families, were swept away together; insomuch that it was frequent for\nneighbours to call to the bellman to go to such-and-such houses and\nfetch out the people, for that they were all dead.\n\nAnd, indeed, the work of removing the dead bodies by carts was now grown\nso very odious and dangerous that it was complained of that the bearers\ndid not take care to clear such houses where all the inhabitants were\ndead, but that sometimes the bodies lay several days unburied, till the\nneighbouring families were offended with the stench, and consequently\ninfected; and this neglect of the officers was such that the\nchurchwardens and constables were summoned to look after it, and even\nthe justices of the Hamlets were obliged to venture their lives among\nthem to quicken and encourage them, for innumerable of the bearers died\nof the distemper, infected by the bodies they were obliged to come so\nnear. And had it not been that the number of poor people who wanted\nemployment and wanted bread (as I have said before) was so great that\nnecessity drove them to undertake anything and venture anything, they\nwould never have found people to be employed. And then the bodies of the\ndead would have lain above ground, and have perished and rotted in a\ndreadful manner.\n\nBut the magistrates cannot be enough commended in this, that they kept\nsuch good order for the burying of the dead, that as fast as any of\nthese they employed to carry off and bury the dead fell sick or died, as\nwas many times the case, they immediately supplied the places with\nothers, which, by reason of the great number of poor that was left out\nof business, as above, was not hard to do. This occasioned, that\nnotwithstanding the infinite number of people which died and were sick,\nalmost all together, yet they were always cleared away and carried off\nevery night, so that it was never to be said of London that the living\nwere not able to bury the dead.\n\nAs the desolation was greater during those terrible times, so the\namazement of the people increased, and a thousand unaccountable things\nthey would do in the violence of their fright, as others did the same in\nthe agonies of their distemper, and this part was very affecting. Some\nwent roaring and crying and wringing their hands along the street; some\nwould go praying and lifting up their hands to heaven, calling upon God\nfor mercy. I cannot say, indeed, whether this was not in their\ndistraction, but, be it so, it was still an indication of a more serious\nmind, when they had the use of their senses, and was much better, even\nas it was, than the frightful yellings and cryings that every day, and\nespecially in the evenings, were heard in some streets. I suppose the\nworld has heard of the famous Solomon Eagle, an enthusiast. He, though\nnot infected at all but in his head, went about denouncing of judgement\nupon the city in a frightful manner, sometimes quite naked, and with a\npan of burning charcoal on his head. What he said, or pretended, indeed\nI could not learn.\n\nI will not say whether that clergyman was distracted or not, or whether\nhe did it in pure zeal for the poor people, who went every evening\nthrough the streets of Whitechappel, and, with his hands lifted up,\nrepeated that part of the Liturgy of the Church continually, 'Spare us,\ngood Lord; spare Thy people, whom Thou has redeemed with Thy most\nprecious blood.' I say, I cannot speak positively of these things,\nbecause these were only the dismal objects which represented themselves\nto me as I looked through my chamber windows (for I seldom opened the\ncasements), while I confined myself within doors during that most\nviolent raging of the pestilence; when, indeed, as I have said, many\nbegan to think, and even to say, that there would none escape; and\nindeed I began to think so too, and therefore kept within doors for\nabout a fortnight and never stirred out. But I could not hold it.\nBesides, there were some people who, notwithstanding the danger, did not\nomit publicly to attend the worship of God, even in the most dangerous\ntimes; and though it is true that a great many clergymen did shut up\ntheir churches, and fled, as other people did, for the safety of their\nlives, yet all did not do so. Some ventured to officiate and to keep up\nthe assemblies of the people by constant prayers, and sometimes sermons\nor brief exhortations to repentance and reformation, and this as long as\nany would come to hear them. And Dissenters did the like also, and even\nin the very churches where the parish ministers were either dead or\nfled; nor was there any room for making difference at such a time as\nthis was.\n\nIt was indeed a lamentable thing to hear the miserable lamentations of\npoor dying creatures calling out for ministers to comfort them and pray\nwith them, to counsel them and to direct them, calling out to God for\npardon and mercy, and confessing aloud their past sins. It would make\nthe stoutest heart bleed to hear how many warnings were then given by\ndying penitents to others not to put off and delay their repentance to\nthe day of distress; that such a time of calamity as this was no time\nfor repentance, was no time to call upon God. I wish I could repeat the\nvery sound of those groans and of those exclamations that I heard from\nsome poor dying creatures when in the height of their agonies and\ndistress, and that I could make him that reads this hear, as I imagine I\nnow hear them, for the sound seems still to ring in my ears.\n\nIf I could but tell this part in such moving accents as should alarm the\nvery soul of the reader, I should rejoice that I recorded those things,\nhowever short and imperfect.\n\nIt pleased God that I was still spared, and very hearty and sound in\nhealth, but very impatient of being pent up within doors without air, as\nI had been for fourteen days or thereabouts; and I could not restrain\nmyself, but I would go to carry a letter for my brother to the post-\nhouse. Then it was indeed that I observed a profound silence in the\nstreets. When I came to the post-house, as I went to put in my letter I\nsaw a man stand in one corner of the yard and talking to another at a\nwindow, and a third had opened a door belonging to the office. In the\nmiddle of the yard lay a small leather purse with two keys hanging at\nit, with money in it, but nobody would meddle with it. I asked how long\nit had lain there; the man at the window said it had lain almost an\nhour, but that they had not meddled with it, because they did not know\nbut the person who dropped it might come back to look for it. I had no\nsuch need of money, nor was the sum so big that I had any inclination to\nmeddle with it, or to get the money at the hazard it might be attended\nwith; so I seemed to go away, when the man who had opened the door said\nhe would take it up, but so that if the right owner came for it he\nshould be sure to have it. So he went in and fetched a pail of water and\nset it down hard by the purse, then went again and fetch some gunpowder,\nand cast a good deal of powder upon the purse, and then made a train\nfrom that which he had thrown loose upon the purse. The train reached\nabout two yards. After this he goes in a third time and fetches out a\npair of tongs red hot, and which he had prepared, I suppose, on purpose;\nand first setting fire to the train of powder, that singed the purse and\nalso smoked the air sufficiently. But he was not content with that, but\nhe then takes up the purse with the tongs, holding it so long till the\ntongs burnt through the purse, and then he shook the money out into the\npail of water, so he carried it in. The money, as I remember, was about\nthirteen shilling and some smooth groats and brass farthings.\n\nThere might perhaps have been several poor people, as I have observed\nabove, that would have been hardy enough to have ventured for the sake\nof the money; but you may easily see by what I have observed that the\nfew people who were spared were very careful of themselves at that time\nwhen the distress was so exceeding great.\n\nMuch about the same time I walked out into the fields towards Bow; for I\nhad a great mind to see how things were managed in the river and among\nthe ships; and as I had some concern in shipping, I had a notion that it\nhad been one of the best ways of securing one's self from the infection\nto have retired into a ship; and musing how to satisfy my curiosity in\nthat point, I turned away over the fields from Bow to Bromley, and down\nto Blackwall to the stairs which are there for landing or taking water.\n\nHere I saw a poor man walking on the bank, or sea-wall, as they call it,\nby himself. I walked a while also about, seeing the houses all shut up.\nAt last I fell into some talk, at a distance, with this poor man; first\nI asked him how people did thereabouts. 'Alas, sir!' says he, 'almost\ndesolate; all dead or sick. Here are very few families in this part, or\nin that village' (pointing at Poplar), 'where half of them are not dead\nalready, and the rest sick.' Then he pointing to one house, 'There they\nare all dead', said he, 'and the house stands open; nobody dares go into\nit. A poor thief', says he, 'ventured in to steal something, but he paid\ndear for his theft, for he was carried to the churchyard too last\nnight.' Then he pointed to several other houses. 'There', says he, 'they\nare all dead, the man and his wife, and five children. There', says he,\n'they are shut up; you see a watchman at the door'; and so of other\nhouses. 'Why,' says I, 'what do you here all alone?' 'Why,' says he, 'I\nam a poor, desolate man; it has pleased God I am not yet visited, though\nmy family is, and one of my children dead.' 'How do you mean, then,'\nsaid I, 'that you are not visited?' 'Why,' says he, 'that's my house'\n(pointing to a very little, low-boarded house), 'and there my poor wife\nand two children live,' said he, 'if they may be said to live, for my\nwife and one of the children are visited, but I do not come at them.'\nAnd with that word I saw the tears run very plentifully down his face;\nand so they did down mine too, I assure you.\n\n'But,' said I, 'why do you not come at them? How can you abandon your\nown flesh and blood?' 'Oh, sir,' says he, 'the Lord forbid! I do not\nabandon them; I work for them as much as I am able; and, blessed be the\nLord, I keep them from want'; and with that I observed he lifted up his\neyes to heaven, with a countenance that presently told me I had happened\non a man that was no hypocrite, but a serious, religious, good man, and\nhis ejaculation was an expression of thankfulness that, in such a\ncondition as he was in, he should be able to say his family did not\nwant. 'Well,' says I, 'honest man, that is a great mercy as things go\nnow with the poor. But how do you live, then, and how are you kept from\nthe dreadful calamity that is now upon us all?' 'Why, sir,' says he, 'I\nam a waterman, and there's my boat,' says he, 'and the boat serves me\nfor a house. I work in it in the day, and I sleep in it in the night;\nand what I get I lay down upon that stone,' says he, showing me a broad\nstone on the other side of the street, a good way from his house; 'and\nthen,' says he, 'I halloo, and call to them till I make them hear; and\nthey come and fetch it.'\n\n'Well, friend,' says I, 'but how can you get any money as a waterman?\nDoes any body go by water these times?' 'Yes, sir,' says he, 'in the way\nI am employed there does. Do you see there,' says he, 'five ships lie at\nanchor' (pointing down the river a good way below the town), 'and do you\nsee', says he, 'eight or ten ships lie at the chain there, and at anchor\nyonder?' (pointing above the town). 'All those ships have families on\nboard, of their merchants and owners, and such-like, who have locked\nthemselves up and live on board, close shut in, for fear of the\ninfection; and I tend on them to fetch things for them, carry letters,\nand do what is absolutely necessary, that they may not be obliged to\ncome on shore; and every night I fasten my boat on board one of the\nship's boats, and there I sleep by myself, and, blessed be God, I am\npreserved hitherto.'\n\n'Well,' said I, 'friend, but will they let you come on board after you\nhave been on shore here, when this is such a terrible place, and so\ninfected as it is?'\n\n'Why, as to that,' said he, 'I very seldom go up the ship-side, but\ndeliver what I bring to their boat, or lie by the side, and they hoist\nit on board. If I did, I think they are in no danger from me, for I\nnever go into any house on shore, or touch anybody, no, not of my own\nfamily; but I fetch provisions for them.'\n\n'Nay,' says I, 'but that may be worse, for you must have those\nprovisions of somebody or other; and since all this part of the town is\nso infected, it is dangerous so much as to speak with anybody, for the\nvillage', said I, 'is, as it were, the beginning of London, though it be\nat some distance from it.'\n\n'That is true,' added he; 'but you do not understand me right; I do not\nbuy provisions for them here. I row up to Greenwich and buy fresh meat\nthere, and sometimes I row down the river to Woolwich and buy there;\nthen I go to single farm-houses on the Kentish side, where I am known,\nand buy fowls and eggs and butter, and bring to the ships, as they\ndirect me, sometimes one, sometimes the other. I seldom come on shore\nhere, and I came now only to call on my wife and hear how my family do,\nand give them a little money, which I received last night.'\n\n'Poor man!' said I; 'and how much hast thou gotten for them?'\n\n'I have gotten four shillings,' said he, 'which is a great sum, as\nthings go now with poor men; but they have given me a bag of bread too,\nand a salt fish and some flesh; so all helps out.' 'Well,' said I, 'and\nhave you given it them yet?'\n\n'No,' said he; 'but I have called, and my wife has answered that she\ncannot come out yet, but in half-an-hour she hopes to come, and I am\nwaiting for her. Poor woman!' says he, 'she is brought sadly down. She\nhas a swelling, and it is broke, and I hope she will recover; but I fear\nthe child will die, but it is the Lord--'\n\nHere he stopped, and wept very much.\n\n'Well, honest friend,' said I, 'thou hast a sure Comforter, if thou hast\nbrought thyself to be resigned to the will of God; He is dealing with us\nall in judgement.'\n\n'Oh, sir!' says he, 'it is infinite mercy if any of us are spared, and\nwho am I to repine!'\n\n'Sayest thou so?' said I, 'and how much less is my faith than thine?'\nAnd here my heart smote me, suggesting how much better this poor man's\nfoundation was on which he stayed in the danger than mine; that he had\nnowhere to fly; that he had a family to bind him to attendance, which I\nhad not; and mine was mere presumption, his a true dependence and a\ncourage resting on God; and yet that he used all possible caution for\nhis safety.\n\nI turned a little way from the man while these thoughts engaged me, for,\nindeed, I could no more refrain from tears than he.\n\nAt length, after some further talk, the poor woman opened the door and\ncalled, 'Robert, Robert'. He answered, and bid her stay a few moments\nand he would come; so he ran down the common stairs to his boat and\nfetched up a sack, in which was the provisions he had brought from the\nships; and when he returned he hallooed again. Then he went to the great\nstone which he showed me and emptied the sack, and laid all out,\neverything by themselves, and then retired; and his wife came with a\nlittle boy to fetch them away, and called and said such a captain had\nsent such a thing, and such a captain such a thing, and at the end adds,\n'God has sent it all; give thanks to Him.' When the poor woman had taken\nup all, she was so weak she could not carry it at once in, though the\nweight was not much neither; so she left the biscuit, which was in a\nlittle bag, and left a little boy to watch it till she came again.\n\n'Well, but', says I to him, 'did you leave her the four shillings too,\nwhich you said was your week's pay?'\n\n'Yes, yes,' says he; 'you shall hear her own it.' So he calls again,\n'Rachel, Rachel,' which it seems was her name, 'did you take up the\nmoney?' 'Yes,' said she. 'How much was it?' said he. 'Four shillings and\na groat,' said she. 'Well, well,' says he, 'the Lord keep you all'; and\nso he turned to go away.\n\nAs I could not refrain contributing tears to this man's story, so\nneither could I refrain my charity for his assistance. So I called him,\n'Hark thee, friend,' said I, 'come hither, for I believe thou art in\nhealth, that I may venture thee'; so I pulled out my hand, which was in\nmy pocket before, 'Here,' says I, 'go and call thy Rachel once more, and\ngive her a little more comfort from me. God will never forsake a family\nthat trust in Him as thou dost.' So I gave him four other shillings, and\nbid him go lay them on the stone and call his wife.\n\nI have not words to express the poor man's thankfulness, neither could\nhe express it himself but by tears running down his face. He called his\nwife, and told her God had moved the heart of a stranger, upon hearing\ntheir condition, to give them all that money, and a great deal more such\nas that he said to her. The woman, too, made signs of the like\nthankfulness, as well to Heaven as to me, and joyfully picked it up; and\nI parted with no money all that year that I thought better bestowed.\n\nI then asked the poor man if the distemper had not reached to Greenwich.\nHe said it had not till about a fortnight before; but that then he\nfeared it had, but that it was only at that end of the town which lay\nsouth towards Deptford Bridge; that he went only to a butcher's shop and\na grocer's, where he generally bought such things as they sent him for,\nbut was very careful.\n\nI asked him then how it came to pass that those people who had so shut\nthemselves up in the ships had not laid in sufficient stores of all\nthings necessary. He said some of them had--but, on the other hand, some\ndid not come on board till they were frighted into it and till it was\ntoo dangerous for them to go to the proper people to lay in quantities\nof things, and that he waited on two ships, which he showed me, that had\nlaid in little or nothing but biscuit bread and ship beer, and that he\nhad bought everything else almost for them. I asked him if there was any\nmore ships that had separated themselves as those had done. He told me\nyes, all the way up from the point, right against Greenwich, to within\nthe shore of Limehouse and Redriff, all the ships that could have room\nrid two and two in the middle of the stream, and that some of them had\nseveral families on board. I asked him if the distemper had not reached\nthem. He said he believed it had not, except two or three ships whose\npeople had not been so watchful to keep the seamen from going on shore\nas others had been, and he said it was a very fine sight to see how the\nships lay up the Pool.\n\nWhen he said he was going over to Greenwich as soon as the tide began to\ncome in, I asked if he would let me go with him and bring me back, for\nthat I had a great mind to see how the ships were ranged, as he had told\nme. He told me, if I would assure him on the word of a Christian and of\nan honest man that I had not the distemper, he would. I assured him that\nI had not; that it had pleased God to preserve me; that I lived in\nWhitechappel, but was too impatient of being so long within doors, and\nthat I had ventured out so far for the refreshment of a little air, but\nthat none in my house had so much as been touched with it.\n\nWell, sir,' says he, 'as your charity has been moved to pity me and my\npoor family, sure you cannot have so little pity left as to put yourself\ninto my boat if you were not sound in health which would be nothing less\nthan killing me and ruining my whole family.' The poor man troubled me\nso much when he spoke of his family with such a sensible concern and in\nsuch an affectionate manner, that I could not satisfy myself at first to\ngo at all. I told him I would lay aside my curiosity rather than make\nhim uneasy, though I was sure, and very thankful for it, that I had no\nmore distemper upon me than the freshest man in the world. Well, he\nwould not have me put it off neither, but to let me see how confident he\nwas that I was just to him, now importuned me to go; so when the tide\ncame up to his boat I went in, and he carried me to Greenwich. While he\nbought the things which he had in his charge to buy, I walked up to the\ntop of the hill under which the town stands, and on the east side of the\ntown, to get a prospect of the river. But it was a surprising sight to\nsee the number of ships which lay in rows, two and two, and some places\ntwo or three such lines in the breadth of the river, and this not only\nup quite to the town, between the houses which we call Ratcliff and\nRedriff, which they name the Pool, but even down the whole river as far\nas the head of Long Reach, which is as far as the hills give us leave to\nsee it.\n\nI cannot guess at the number of ships, but I think there must be several\nhundreds of sail; and I could not but applaud the contrivance: for ten\nthousand people and more who attended ship affairs were certainly\nsheltered here from the violence of the contagion, and lived very safe\nand very easy.\n\nI returned to my own dwelling very well satisfied with my day's journey,\nand particularly with the poor man; also I rejoiced to see that such\nlittle sanctuaries were provided for so many families in a time of such\ndesolation. I observed also that, as the violence of the plague had\nincreased, so the ships which had families on board removed and went\nfarther off, till, as I was told, some went quite away to sea, and put\ninto such harbours and safe roads on the north coast as they could best\ncome at.\n\nBut it was also true that all the people who thus left the land and\nlived on board the ships were not entirely safe from the infection, for\nmany died and were thrown overboard into the river, some in coffins, and\nsome, as I heard, without coffins, whose bodies were seen sometimes to\ndrive up and down with the tide in the river.\n\nBut I believe I may venture to say that in those ships which were thus\ninfected it either happened where the people had recourse to them too\nlate, and did not fly to the ship till they had stayed too long on shore\nand had the distemper upon them (though perhaps they might not perceive\nit) and so the distemper did not come to them on board the ships, but\nthey really carried it with them; or it was in these ships where the\npoor waterman said they had not had time to furnish themselves with\nprovisions, but were obliged to send often on shore to buy what they had\noccasion for, or suffered boats to come to them from the shore. And so\nthe distemper was brought insensibly among them.\n\nAnd here I cannot but take notice that the strange temper of the people\nof London at that time contributed extremely to their own destruction.\nThe plague began, as I have observed, at the other end of the town,\nnamely, in Long Acre, Drury Lane, &c., and came on towards the city very\ngradually and slowly. It was felt at first in December, then again in\nFebruary, then again in April, and always but a very little at a time;\nthen it stopped till May, and even the last week in May there was but\nseventeen, and all at that end of the town; and all this while, even so\nlong as till there died above 3000 a week, yet had the people in\nRedriff, and in Wapping and Ratcliff, on both sides of the river, and\nalmost all Southwark side, a mighty fancy that they should not be\nvisited, or at least that it would not be so violent among them. Some\npeople fancied the smell of the pitch and tar, and such other things as\noil and rosin and brimstone, which is so much used by all trades\nrelating to shipping, would preserve them. Others argued it, because it\nwas in its extreamest violence in Westminster and the parish of St Giles\nand St Andrew, &c., and began to abate again before it came among them--\nwhich was true indeed, in part.

But they paid for it\nafterwards, as I shall observe by-and-by.\n\nThis, I say, made the people of Redriff and Wapping, Ratcliff and\nLimehouse, so secure, and flatter themselves so much with the plague's\ngoing off without reaching them, that they took no care either to fly\ninto the country or shut themselves up. Nay, so far were they from\nstirring that they rather received their friends and relations from the\ncity into their houses, and several from other places really took\nsanctuary in that part of the town as a Place of safety, and as a place\nwhich they thought God would pass over, and not visit as the rest was\nvisited.\n\nAnd this was the reason that when it came upon them, they were more\nsurprised, more unprovided, and more at a loss what to do than they were\nin other places; for when it came among them really and with violence,\nas it did indeed in September and October, there was then no stirring\nout into the country, nobody would suffer a stranger to come near them,\nno, nor near the towns where they dwelt; and, as I have been told,\nseveral that wandered into the country on Surrey side were found starved\nto death in the woods and commons, that country being more open and more\nwoody than any other part so near London, especially about Norwood and\nthe parishes of Camberwell, Dullege, and Lusum, where, it seems, nobody\ndurst relieve the poor distressed people for fear of the infection.\n\nThis notion having, as I said, prevailed with the people in that part of\nthe town, was in part the occasion, as I said before, that they had\nrecourse to ships for their retreat; and where they did this early and\nwith prudence, furnishing themselves so with provisions that they had no\nneed to go on shore for supplies or suffer boats to come on board to\nbring them,--I say, where they did so they had certainly the safest\nretreat of any people whatsoever; but the distress was such that people\nran on board, in their fright, without bread to eat, and some into ships\nthat had no men on board to remove them farther off, or to take the boat\nand go down the river to buy provisions where it might be done safely,\nand these often suffered and were infected on board as much as on shore.\n\nAs the richer sort got into ships, so the lower rank got into hoys,\nsmacks, lighters, and fishing-boats; and many, especially watermen, lay\nin their boats; but those made sad work of it, especially the latter,\nfor, going about for provision, and perhaps to get their subsistence,\nthe infection got in among them and made a fearful havoc; many of the\nwatermen died alone in their wherries as they rid at their roads, as\nwell as above bridge as below, and were not found sometimes till they\nwere not in condition for anybody to touch or come near them.\n\nIndeed, the distress of the people at this seafaring end of the town was\nvery deplorable, and deserved the greatest commiseration. But, alas,\nthis was a time when every one's private safety lay so near them that\nthey had no room to pity the distresses of others; for every one had\ndeath, as it were, at his door, and many even in their families, and\nknew not what to do or whither to fly.\n\nThis, I say, took away all compassion; self-preservation, indeed,\nappeared here to be the first law. For the children ran away from their\nparents as they languished in the utmost distress. And in some places,\nthough not so frequent as the other, parents did the like to their\nchildren; nay, some dreadful examples there were, and particularly two\nin one week, of distressed mothers, raving and distracted, killing their\nown children; one whereof was not far off from where I dwelt, the poor\nlunatic creature not living herself long enough to be sensible of the\nsin of what she had done, much less to be punished for it.\n\nIt is not, indeed, to be wondered at: for the danger of immediate death\nto ourselves took away all bowels of love, all concern for one another.\nI speak in general, for there were many instances of immovable\naffection, pity, and duty in many, and some that came to my knowledge,\nthat is to say, by hearsay; for I shall not take upon me to vouch the\ntruth of the particulars.\n\nTo introduce one, let me first mention that one of the most deplorable\ncases in all the present calamity was that of women with child, who,\nwhen they came to the hour of their sorrows, and their pains come upon\nthem, could neither have help of one kind or another; neither midwife or\nneighbouring women to come near them. Most of the midwives were dead,\nespecially of such as served the poor; and many, if not all the midwives\nof note, were fled into the country; so that it was next to impossible\nfor a poor woman that could not pay an immoderate price to get any\nmidwife to come to her--and if they did, those they could get were\ngenerally unskilful and ignorant creatures; and the consequence of this\nwas that a most unusual and incredible number of women were reduced to\nthe utmost distress. Some were delivered and spoiled by the rashness and\nignorance of those who pretended to lay them. Children without number\nwere, I might say, murdered by the same but a more justifiable\nignorance: pretending they would save the mother, whatever became of the\nchild; and many times both mother and child were lost in the same\nmanner; and especially where the mother had the distemper, there nobody\nwould come near them and both sometimes perished. Sometimes the mother\nhas died of the plague, and the infant, it may be, half born, or born\nbut not parted from the mother. Some died in the very pains of their\ntravail, and not delivered at all; and so many were the cases of this\nkind that it is hard to judge of them.\n\nSomething of it will appear in the unusual numbers which are put into\nthe weekly bills (though I am far from allowing them to be able to give\nanything of a full account) under the articles of--\n\n\n     Child-bed.\n     Abortive and Still-born.\n     Christmas and Infants.\n\nTake the weeks in which the plague was most violent, and compare them\nwith the weeks before the distemper began, even in the same year. For\nexample:--\n\n\n     Child-bed. Abortive.  Still-born.\n     From January 3 to January  10     7        1           13\n     \"     \"   10       \"       17     8        6           11\n     \"     \"   17       \"       24     9        5           15\n     \"     \"   24       \"       31     3        2            9\n     \"     \"   31 to February    7     3        3            8\n     \" February 7        \"      14     6        2           11\n     \"     \"   14       \"       21     5        2           13\n     \"     \"   21       \"       28     2        2           10\n     \"     \"   28 to March       7     5        1           10\n     -                               ---      ---         ----\n     -                                48       24          100\n\n     From August  1 to August    8    25        5           11\n     \"     \"    8       \"       15    23        6            8\n     \"     \"   15       \"       22    28        4            4\n     \"     \"   22       \"       29    40        6           10\n     \"     \"   29 to September   5    38        2           11\n     September  5       \"       12    39       23          ...\n     \"     \"   12       \"       19    42        5           17\n     \"     \"   19       \"       26    42        6           10\n     \"     \"   26 to October     3    14        4            9\n     -                               ---       --          ---\n     -                               291       61           80\n\nTo the disparity of these numbers it is to be considered and allowed\nfor, that according to our usual opinion who were then upon the spot,\nthere were not one-third of the people in the town during the months of\nAugust and September as were in the months of January and February. In a\nword, the usual number that used to die of these three articles, and, as\nI hear, did die of them the year before, was thus:--\n\n\n     1664.                               1665.\n     Child-bed                   189     Child-bed                   625\n     Abortive and still-born     458     Abortive and still-born     617\n     -                          ----                                ----\n     -                           647                                1242\n\nThis inequality, I say, is exceedingly augmented when the numbers of\npeople are considered. I pretend not to make any exact calculation of\nthe numbers of people which were at this time in the city, but I shall\nmake a probable conjecture at that part by-and-by. What I have said now\nis to explain the misery of those poor creatures above; so that it might\nwell be said, as in the Scripture, Woe be to those who are with child,\nand to those which give suck in that day. For, indeed, it was a woe to\nthem in particular.\n\nI was not conversant in many particular families where these things\nhappened, but the outcries of the miserable were heard afar off. As to\nthose who were with child, we have seen some calculation made; 291 women\ndead in child-bed in nine weeks, out of one-third part of the number of\nwhom there usually died in that time but eighty-four of the same\ndisaster. Let the reader calculate the proportion.\n\nThere is no room to doubt but the misery of those that gave suck was in\nproportion as great. Our bills of mortality could give but little light\nin this, yet some it did. There were several more than usual starved at\nnurse, but this was nothing. The misery was where they were, first,\nstarved for want of a nurse, the mother dying and all the family and the\ninfants found dead by them, merely for want; and, if I may speak my\nopinion, I do believe that many hundreds of poor helpless infants\nperished in this manner. Secondly, not starved, but poisoned by the\nnurse. Nay, even where the mother has been nurse, and having received\nthe infection, has poisoned, that is, infected the infant with her milk\neven before they knew they were infected themselves; nay, and the infant\nhas died in such a case before the mother. I cannot but remember to\nleave this admonition upon record, if ever such another dreadful\nvisitation should happen in this city, that all women that are with\nchild or that give suck should be gone, if they have any possible means,\nout of the place, because their misery, if infected, will so much exceed\nall other people's.\n\nI could tell here dismal stories of living infants being found sucking\nthe breasts of their mothers, or nurses, after they have been dead of\nthe plague. Of a mother in the parish where I lived, who, having a child\nthat was not well, sent for an apothecary to view the child; and when he\ncame, as the relation goes, was giving the child suck at her breast, and\nto all appearance was herself very well; but when the apothecary came\nclose to her he saw the tokens upon that breast with which she was\nsuckling the child. He was surprised enough, to be sure, but, not\nwilling to fright the poor woman too much, he desired she would give the\nchild into his hand; so he takes the child, and going to a cradle in the\nroom, lays it in, and opening its cloths, found the tokens upon the\nchild too, and both died before he could get home to send a preventive\nmedicine to the father of the child, to whom he had told their\ncondition. Whether the child infected the nurse-mother or the mother the\nchild was not certain, but the last most likely. Likewise of a child\nbrought home to the parents from a nurse that had died of the plague,\nyet the tender mother would not refuse to take in her child, and laid it\nin her bosom, by which she was infected; and died with the child in her\narms dead also.\n\nIt would make the hardest heart move at the instances that were\nfrequently found of tender mothers tending and watching with their dear\nchildren, and even dying before them, and sometimes taking the distemper\nfrom them and dying, when the child for whom the affectionate heart had\nbeen sacrificed has got over it and escaped.\n\nThe like of a tradesman in East Smithfield, whose wife was big with\nchild of her first child, and fell in labour, having the plague upon\nher. He could neither get midwife to assist her or nurse to tend her,\nand two servants which he kept fled both from her. He ran from house to\nhouse like one distracted, but could get no help; the utmost he could\nget was, that a watchman, who attended at an infected house shut up,\npromised to send a nurse in the morning. The poor man, with his heart\nbroke, went back, assisted his wife what he could, acted the part of the\nmidwife, brought the child dead into the world, and his wife in about an\nhour died in his arms, where he held her dead body fast till the\nmorning, when the watchman came and brought the nurse as he had\npromised; and coming up the stairs (for he had left the door open, or\nonly latched), they found the man sitting with his dead wife in his\narms, and so overwhelmed with grief that he died in a few hours after\nwithout any sign of the infection upon him, but merely sunk under the\nweight of his grief.\n\nI have heard also of some who, on the death of their relations, have\ngrown stupid with the insupportable sorrow; and of one, in particular,\nwho was so absolutely overcome with the pressure upon his spirits that\nby degrees his head sank into his body, so between his shoulders that\nthe crown of his head was very little seen above the bone of his\nshoulders; and by degrees losing both voice and sense, his face, looking\nforward, lay against his collarbone and could not be kept up any\notherwise, unless held up by the hands of other people; and the poor man\nnever came to himself again, but languished near a year in that\ncondition, and died. Nor was he ever once seen to lift up his eyes or to\nlook upon any particular object.\n\nI cannot undertake to give any other than a summary of such passages as\nthese, because it was not possible to come at the particulars, where\nsometimes the whole families where such things happened were carried off\nby the distemper. But there were innumerable cases of this kind which\npresented to the eye and the ear, even in passing along the streets, as\nI have hinted above. Nor is it easy to give any story of this or that\nfamily which there was not divers parallel stories to be met with of the\nsame kind.\n\nBut as I am now talking of the time when the plague raged at the\neasternmost part of the town--how for a long time the people of those\nparts had flattered themselves that they should escape, and how they\nwere surprised when it came upon them as it did; for, indeed, it came\nupon them like an armed man when it did come;--I say, this brings me\nback to the three poor men who wandered from Wapping, not knowing\nwhither to go or what to do, and whom I mentioned before; one a biscuit-\nbaker, one a sailmaker, and the other a joiner, all of Wapping, or\nthere-abouts.\n\nThe sleepiness and security of that part, as I have observed, was such\nthat they not only did not shift for themselves as others did, but they\nboasted of being safe, and of safety being with them; and many people\nfled out of the city, and out of the infected suburbs, to Wapping,\nRatcliff, Limehouse, Poplar, and such Places, as to Places of security;\nand it is not at all unlikely that their doing this helped to bring the\nplague that way faster than it might otherwise have come. For though I\nam much for people flying away and emptying such a town as this upon the\nfirst appearance of a like visitation, and that all people who have any\npossible retreat should make use of it in time and be gone, yet I must\nsay, when all that will fly are gone, those that are left and must stand\nit should stand stock-still where they are, and not shift from one end\nof the town or one part of the town to the other; for that is the bane\nand mischief of the whole, and they carry the plague from house to house\nin their very clothes.\n\nWherefore were we ordered to kill all the dogs and cats, but because as\nthey were domestic animals, and are apt to run from house to house and\nfrom street to street, so they are capable of carrying the effluvia or\ninfectious streams of bodies infected even in their furs and hair? And\ntherefore it was that, in the beginning of the infection, an order was\npublished by the Lord Mayor, and by the magistrates, according to the\nadvice of the physicians, that all the dogs and cats should be\nimmediately killed, and an officer was appointed for the execution.\n\nIt is incredible, if their account is to be depended upon, what a\nprodigious number of those creatures were destroyed. I think they talked\nof forty thousand dogs, and five times as many cats; few houses being\nwithout a cat, some having several, sometimes five or six in a house.\nAll possible endeavours were used also to destroy the mice and rats,\nespecially the latter, by laying ratsbane and other poisons for them,\nand a prodigious multitude of them were also destroyed.\n\nI often reflected upon the unprovided condition that the whole body of\nthe people were in at the first coming of this calamity upon them, and\nhow it was for want of timely entering into measures and managements, as\nwell public as private, that all the confusions that followed were\nbrought upon us, and that such a prodigious number of people sank in\nthat disaster, which, if proper steps had been taken, might, Providence\nconcurring, have been avoided, and which, if posterity think fit, they\nmay take a caution and warning from. But I shall come to this part\nagain.\n\nI come back to my three men. Their story has a moral in every part of\nit, and their whole conduct, and that of some whom they joined with, is\na pattern for all poor men to follow, or women either, if ever such a\ntime comes again; and if there was no other end in recording it, I think\nthis a very just one, whether my account be exactly according to fact or\nno.\n\nTwo of them are said to be brothers, the one an old soldier, but now a\nbiscuit-maker; the other a lame sailor, but now a sailmaker; the third a\njoiner. Says John the biscuit-maker one day to Thomas his brother, the\nsailmaker, 'Brother Tom, what will become of us? The plague grows hot in\nthe city, and increases this way. What shall we do?'\n\n'Truly,' says Thomas, 'I am at a great loss what to do, for I find if it\ncomes down into Wapping I shall be turned out of my lodging.' And thus\nthey began to talk of it beforehand.\n\nJohn. Turned out of your lodging, Tom! If you are, I don't know who\nwill take you in; for people are so afraid of one another now, there's\nno getting a lodging anywhere.\n\nThomas. Why, the people where I lodge are good, civil people, and have\nkindness enough for me too; but they say I go abroad every day to my\nwork, and it will be dangerous; and they talk of locking themselves up\nand letting nobody come near them.\n\nJohn. Why, they are in the right, to be sure, if they resolve to venture\nstaying in town.\n\nThomas. Nay, I might even resolve to stay within doors too, for, except\na suit of sails that my master has in hand, and which I am just\nfinishing, I am like to get no more work a great while. There's no trade\nstirs now. Workmen and servants are turned off everywhere, so that I\nmight be glad to be locked up too; but I do not see they will be willing\nto consent to that, any more than to the other.\n\nJohn. Why, what will you do then, brother? And what shall I do? for I am\nalmost as bad as you. The people where I lodge are all gone into the\ncountry but a maid, and she is to go next week, and to shut the house\nquite up, so that I shall be turned adrift to the wide world before you,\nand I am resolved to go away too, if I knew but where to go.\n\nThomas. We were both distracted we did not go away at first; then we\nmight have travelled anywhere. There's no stirring now; we shall be\nstarved if we pretend to go out of town. They won't let us have\nvictuals, no, not for our money, nor let us come into the towns, much\nless into their houses.\n\nJohn. And that which is almost as bad, I have but little money to help\nmyself with neither.\n\nThomas. As to that, we might make shift, I have a little, though not\nmuch; but I tell you there's no stirring on the road. I know a couple of\npoor honest men in our street have attempted to travel, and at Barnet,\nor Whetstone, or thereabouts, the people offered to fire at them if they\npretended to go forward, so they are come back again quite discouraged.\n\nJohn. I would have ventured their fire if I had been there. If I had\nbeen denied food for my money they should have seen me take it before\ntheir faces, and if I had tendered money for it they could not have\ntaken any course with me by law.\n\nThomas. You talk your old soldier's language, as if you were in the Low\nCountries now, but this is a serious thing. The people have good reason\nto keep anybody off that they are not satisfied are sound, at such a\ntime as this, and we must not plunder them.\n\nJohn. No, brother, you mistake the case, and mistake me too. I would\nplunder nobody; but for any town upon the road to deny me leave to pass\nthrough the town in the open highway, and deny me provisions for my\nmoney, is to say the town has a right to starve me to death, which\ncannot be true.\n\nThomas. But they do not deny you liberty to go back again from whence\nyou came, and therefore they do not starve you.\n\nJohn. But the next town behind me will, by the same rule, deny me leave\nto go back, and so they do starve me between them. Besides, there is no\nlaw to prohibit my travelling wherever I will on the road.\n\nThomas. But there will be so much difficulty in disputing with them at\nevery town on the road that it is not for poor men to do it or undertake\nit, at such a time as this is especially.\n\nJohn. Why, brother, our condition at this rate is worse than anybody\nelse's, for we can neither go away nor stay here. I am of the same mind\nwith the lepers of Samaria: 'If we stay here we are sure to die', I mean\nespecially as you and I are stated, without a dwelling-house of our own,\nand without lodging in anybody else's. There is no lying in the street\nat such a time as this; we had as good go into the dead-cart at once.\nTherefore I say, if we stay here we are sure to die, and if we go away\nwe can but die; I am resolved to be gone.\n\nThomas. You will go away. Whither will you go, and what can you do? I\nwould as willingly go away as you, if I knew whither. But we have no\nacquaintance, no friends. Here we were born, and here we must die.\n\nJohn. Look you, Tom, the whole kingdom is my native country as well as\nthis town. You may as well say I must not go out of my house if it is on\nfire as that I must not go out of the town I was born in when it is\ninfected with the plague. I was born in England, and have a right to\nlive in it if I can.\n\nThomas. But you know every vagrant person may by the laws of England be\ntaken up, and passed back to their last legal settlement.\n\nJohn. But how shall they make me vagrant? I desire only to travel on,\nupon my lawful occasions.\n\nThomas. What lawful occasions can we pretend to travel, or rather wander\nupon? They will not be put off with words.\n\nJohn. Is not flying to save our lives a lawful occasion? And do they not\nall know that the fact is true? We cannot be said to dissemble.\n\nThomas. But suppose they let us pass, whither shall we go?\n\nJohn. Anywhere, to save our lives; it is time enough to consider that\nwhen we are got out of this town. If I am once out of this dreadful\nplace, I care not where I go.\n\nThomas. We shall be driven to great extremities. I know not what to\nthink of it.\n\nJohn. Well, Tom, consider of it a little.\n\nThis was about the beginning of July; and though the plague was come\nforward in the west and north parts of the town, yet all Wapping, as I\nhave observed before, and Redriff, and Ratdiff, and Limehouse, and\nPoplar, in short, Deptford and Greenwich, all both sides of the river\nfrom the Hermitage, and from over against it, quite down to Blackwall,\nwas entirely free; there had not one person died of the plague in all\nStepney parish, and not one on the south side of Whitechappel Road, no,\nnot in any parish; and yet the weekly bill was that very week risen up\nto 1006.\n\nIt was a fortnight after this before the two brothers met again, and\nthen the case was a little altered, and the plague was exceedingly\nadvanced and the number greatly increased; the bill was up at 2785, and\nprodigiously increasing, though still both sides of the river, as below,\nkept pretty well. But some began to die in Redriff, and about five or\nsix in Ratcliff Highway, when the sailmaker came to his brother John\nexpress, and in some fright; for he was absolutely warned out of his\nlodging, and had only a week to provide himself. His brother John was in\nas bad a case, for he was quite out, and had only begged leave of his\nmaster, the biscuit-maker, to lodge in an outhouse belonging to his\nworkhouse, where he only lay upon straw, with some biscuit-sacks, or\nbread-sacks, as they called them, laid upon it, and some of the same\nsacks to cover him.\n\nHere they resolved (seeing all employment being at an end, and no work\nor wages to be had), they would make the best of their way to get out of\nthe reach of the dreadful infection, and, being as good husbands as they\ncould, would endeavour to live upon what they had as long as it would\nlast, and then work for more if they could get work anywhere, of any\nkind, let it be what it would.\n\nWhile they were considering to put this resolution in practice in the\nbest manner they could, the third man, who was acquainted very well with\nthe sailmaker, came to know of the design, and got leave to be one of\nthe number; and thus they prepared to set out.\n\nIt happened that they had not an equal share of money; but as the\nsailmaker, who had the best stock, was, besides his being lame, the most\nunfit to expect to get anything by working in the country, so he was\ncontent that what money they had should all go into one public stock, on\ncondition that whatever any one of them could gain more than another, it\nshould without any grudging be all added to the public stock.\n\nThey resolved to load themselves with as little baggage as possible\nbecause they resolved at first to travel on foot, and to go a great way\nthat they might, if possible, be effectually safe; and a great many\nconsultations they had with themselves before they could agree about\nwhat way they should travel, which they were so far from adjusting that\neven to the morning they set out they were not resolved on it.\n\nAt last the seaman put in a hint that determined it. 'First,' says he,\n'the weather is very hot, and therefore I am for travelling north, that\nwe may not have the sun upon our faces and beating on our breasts, which\nwill heat and suffocate us; and I have been told', says he, 'that it is\nnot good to overheat our blood at a time when, for aught we know, the\ninfection may be in the very air. In the next place,' says he, 'I am for\ngoing the way that may be contrary to the wind, as it may blow when we\nset out, that we may not have the wind blow the air of the city on our\nbacks as we go.' These two cautions were approved of, if it could be\nbrought so to hit that the wind might not be in the south when they set\nout to go north.\n\nJohn the baker, who had been a soldier, then put in his opinion.\n'First,' says he, 'we none of us expect to get any lodging on the road,\nand it will be a little too hard to lie just in the open air. Though it\nbe warm weather, yet it may be wet and damp, and we have a double reason\nto take care of our healths at such a time as this; and therefore,' says\nhe, 'you, brother Tom, that are a sailmaker, might easily make us a\nlittle tent, and I will undertake to set it up every night, and take it\ndown, and a fig for all the inns in England; if we have a good tent over\nour heads we shall do well enough.'\n\nThe joiner opposed this, and told them, let them leave that to him; he\nwould undertake to build them a house every night with his hatchet and\nmallet, though he had no other tools, which should be fully to their\nsatisfaction, and as good as a tent.\n\nThe soldier and the joiner disputed that point some time, but at last\nthe soldier carried it for a tent. The only objection against it was,\nthat it must be carried with them, and that would increase their baggage\ntoo much, the weather being hot; but the sailmaker had a piece of good\nhap, fell in which made that easy, for his master whom he worked for,\nhaving a rope-walk as well as sailmaking trade, had a little, poor horse\nthat he made no use of then; and being willing to assist the three\nhonest men, he gave them the horse for the carrying their baggage; also\nfor a small matter of three days' work that his man did for him before\nhe went, he let him have an old top-gallant sail that was worn out, but\nwas sufficient and more than enough to make a very good tent. The\nsoldier showed how to shape it, and they soon by his direction made\ntheir tent, and fitted it with poles or staves for the purpose; and thus\nthey were furnished for their journey, viz., three men, one tent, one\nhorse, one gun--for the soldier would not go without arms, for now he\nsaid he was no more a biscuit-baker, but a trooper.\n\nThe joiner had a small bag of tools such as might be useful if he should\nget any work abroad, as well for their subsistence as his own. What\nmoney they had they brought all into one public stock, and thus they\nbegan their journey. It seems that in the morning when they set out the\nwind blew, as the sailor said, by his pocket-compass, at N.W. by W. So\nthey directed, or rather resolved to direct, their course N.W.\n\nBut then a difficulty came in their way, that, as they set out from the\nhither end of Wapping, near the Hermitage, and that the plague was now\nvery violent, especially on the north side of the city, as in Shoreditch\nand Cripplegate parish, they did not think it safe for them to go near\nthose parts; so they went away east through Ratcliff Highway as far as\nRatcliff Cross, and leaving Stepney Church still on their left hand,\nbeing afraid to come up from Ratcliff Cross to Mile End, because they\nmust come just by the churchyard, and because the wind, that seemed to\nblow more from the west, blew directly from the side of the city where\nthe plague was hottest. So, I say, leaving Stepney they fetched a long\ncompass, and going to Poplar and Bromley, came into the great road just\nat Bow.\n\nHere the watch placed upon Bow Bridge would have questioned them, but\nthey, crossing the road into a narrow way that turns out of the hither\nend of the town of Bow to Old Ford, avoided any inquiry there, and\ntravelled to Old Ford. The constables everywhere were upon their guard\nnot so much, It seems, to stop people passing by as to stop them from\ntaking up their abode in their towns, and withal because of a report\nthat was newly raised at that time: and that, indeed, was not very\nimprobable, viz., that the poor people in London, being distressed and\nstarved for want of work, and by that means for want of bread, were up\nin arms and had raised a tumult, and that they would come out to all the\ntowns round to plunder for bread. This, I say, was only a rumour, and it\nwas very well it was no more. But it was not so far off from being a\nreality as it has been thought, for in a few weeks more the poor people\nbecame so desperate by the calamity they suffered that they were with\ngreat difficulty kept from going out into the fields and towns, and\ntearing all in pieces wherever they came; and, as I have observed\nbefore, nothing hindered them but that the plague raged so violently and\nfell in upon them so furiously that they rather went to the grave by\nthousands than into the fields in mobs by thousands; for, in the parts\nabout the parishes of St Sepulcher, Clarkenwell, Cripplegate,\nBishopsgate, and Shoreditch, which were the places where the mob began\nto threaten, the distemper came on so furiously that there died in those\nfew parishes even then, before the plague was come to its height, no\nless than 5361 people in the first three weeks in August; when at the\nsame time the parts about Wapping, Radcliff, and Rotherhithe were, as\nbefore described, hardly touched, or but very lightly; so that in a word\nthough, as I said before, the good management of the Lord Mayor and\njustices did much to prevent the rage and desperation of the people from\nbreaking out in rabbles and tumults, and in short from the poor\nplundering the rich,--I say, though they did much, the dead-carts did\nmore: for as I have said that in five parishes only there died above\n5000 in twenty days, so there might be probably three times that number\nsick all that time; for some recovered, and great numbers fell sick\nevery day and died afterwards. Besides, I must still be allowed to say\nthat if the bills of mortality said five thousand, I always believed it\nwas near twice as many in reality, there being no room to believe that\nthe account they gave was right, or that indeed they were among such\nconfusions as I saw them in, in any condition to keep an exact account.\n\nBut to return to my travellers. Here they were only examined, and as\nthey seemed rather coming from the country than from the city, they\nfound the people the easier with them; that they talked to them, let\nthem come into a public-house where the constable and his warders were,\nand gave them drink and some victuals which greatly refreshed and\nencouraged them; and here it came into their heads to say, when they\nshould be inquired of afterwards, not that they came from London, but\nthat they came out of Essex.\n\nTo forward this little fraud, they obtained so much favour of the\nconstable at Old Ford as to give them a certificate of their passing\nfrom Essex through that village, and that they had not been at London;\nwhich, though false in the common acceptance of London in the county,\nyet was literally true, Wapping or Ratcliff being no part either of the\ncity or liberty.\n\nThis certificate directed to the next constable that was at Homerton,\none of the hamlets of the parish of Hackney, was so serviceable to them\nthat it procured them, not a free passage there only, but a full\ncertificate of health from a justice of the peace, who upon the\nconstable's application granted it without much difficulty; and thus\nthey passed through the long divided town of Hackney (for it lay then in\nseveral separated hamlets), and travelled on till they came into the\ngreat north road on the top of Stamford Hill.\n\nBy this time they began to be weary, and so in the back-road from\nHackney, a little before it opened into the said great road, they\nresolved to set up their tent and encamp for the first night, which they\ndid accordingly, with this addition, that finding a barn, or a building\nlike a barn, and first searching as well as they could to be sure there\nwas nobody in it, they set up their tent, with the head of it against\nthe barn. This they did also because the wind blew that night very high,\nand they were but young at such a way of lodging, as well as at the\nmanaging their tent.\n\nHere they went to sleep; but the joiner, a grave and sober man, and not\npleased with their lying at this loose rate the first night, could not\nsleep, and resolved, after trying to sleep to no purpose, that he would\nget out, and, taking the gun in his hand, stand sentinel and guard his\ncompanions. So with the gun in his hand, he walked to and again before\nthe barn, for that stood in the field near the road, but within the\nhedge. He had not been long upon the scout but he heard a noise of\npeople coming on, as if it had been a great number, and they came on, as\nhe thought, directly towards the barn. He did not presently awake his\ncompanions; but in a few minutes more, their noise growing louder and\nlouder, the biscuit-baker called to him and asked him what was the\nmatter, and quickly started out too. The other, being the lame sailmaker\nand most weary, lay still in the tent.\n\nAs they expected, so the people whom they had heard came on directly to\nthe barn, when one of our travellers challenged, like soldiers upon the\nguard, with 'Who comes there?' The people did not answer immediately,\nbut one of them speaking to another that was behind him, 'Alas! alas!\nwe are all disappointed,' says he. 'Here are some people before us; the\nbarn is taken up.'\n\nThey all stopped upon that, as under some surprise, and it seems there\nwas about thirteen of them in all, and some women among them. They\nconsulted together what they should do, and by their discourse our\ntravellers soon found they were poor, distressed people too, like\nthemselves, seeking shelter and safety; and besides, our travellers had\nno need to be afraid of their coming up to disturb them, for as soon as\nthey heard the words, 'Who comes there?' these could hear the women say,\nas if frighted, 'Do not go near them. How do you know but they may have\nthe plague?' And when one of the men said, 'Let us but speak to them',\nthe women said, 'No, don't by any means. We have escaped thus far by the\ngoodness of God; do not let us run into danger now, we beseech you.'\n\nOur travellers found by this that they were a good, sober sort of\npeople, and flying for their lives, as they were; and, as they were\nencouraged by it, so John said to the joiner, his comrade, 'Let us\nencourage them too as much as we can'; so he called to them, 'Hark ye,\ngood people,' says the joiner, 'we find by your talk that you are flying\nfrom the same dreadful enemy as we are. Do not be afraid of us; we are\nonly three poor men of us. If you are free from the distemper you shall\nnot be hurt by us. We are not in the barn, but in a little tent here in\nthe outside, and we will remove for you; we can set up our tent again\nimmediately anywhere else'; and upon this a parley began between the\njoiner, whose name was Richard, and one of their men, who said his name\nwas Ford.\n\nFord. And do you assure us that you are all sound men?\n\nRichard. Nay, we are concerned to tell you of it, that you may not be\nuneasy or think yourselves in danger; but you see we do not desire you\nshould put yourselves into any danger, and therefore I tell you that we\nhave not made use of the barn, so we will remove from it, that you may\nbe safe and we also.\n\nFord. That is very kind and charitable; but if we have reason to be\nsatisfied that you are sound and free from the visitation, why should we\nmake you remove now you are settled in your lodging, and, it may be, are\nlaid down to rest? We will go into the barn, if you please, to rest\nourselves a while, and we need not disturb you.\n\nRichard. Well, but you are more than we are. I hope you will assure us\nthat you are all of you sound too, for the danger is as great from you\nto us as from us to you.\n\nFord. Blessed be God that some do escape, though it is but few; what may\nbe our portion still we know not, but hitherto we are preserved.\n\nRichard. What part of the town do you come from? Was the plague come to\nthe places where you lived?\n\nFord. Ay, ay, in a most frightful and terrible manner, or else we had\nnot fled away as we do; but we believe there will be very few left alive\nbehind us.\n\nRichard. What part do you come from?\n\nFord. We are most of us of Cripplegate parish, only two or three of\nClerkenwell parish, but on the hither side.\n\nRichard. How then was it that you came away no sooner?\n\nFord. We have been away some time, and kept together as well as we could\nat the hither end of Islington, where we got leave to lie in an old\nuninhabited house, and had some bedding and conveniences of our own that\nwe brought with us; but the plague is come up into Islington too, and a\nhouse next door to our poor dwelling was infected and shut up; and we\nare come away in a fright.\n\nRichard. And what way are you going?\n\nFord. As our lot shall cast us; we know not whither, but God will guide\nthose that look up to Him.\n\nThey parleyed no further at that time, but came all up to the barn, and\nwith some difficulty got into it. There was nothing but hay in the barn,\nbut it was almost full of that, and they accommodated themselves as well\nas they could, and went to rest; but our travellers observed that before\nthey went to sleep an ancient man who it seems was father of one of the\nwomen, went to prayer with all the company, recommending themselves to\nthe blessing and direction of Providence, before they went to sleep.\n\nIt was soon day at that time of the year, and as Richard the joiner had\nkept guard the first part of the night, so John the soldier relieved\nhim, and he had the post in the morning, and they began to be acquainted\nwith one another. It seems when they left Islington they intended to\nhave gone north, away to Highgate, but were stopped at Holloway, and\nthere they would not let them pass; so they crossed over the fields and\nhills to the eastward, and came out at the Boarded River, and so\navoiding the towns, they left Hornsey on the left hand and Newington on\nthe right hand, and came into the great road about Stamford Hill on that\nside, as the three travellers had done on the other side. And now they\nhad thoughts of going over the river in the marshes, and make forwards\nto Epping Forest, where they hoped they should get leave to rest. It\nseems they were not poor, at least not so poor as to be in want; at\nleast they had enough to subsist them moderately for two or three\nmonths, when, as they said, they were in hopes the cold weather would\ncheck the infection, or at least the violence of it would have spent\nitself, and would abate, if it were only for want of people left alive\nto be infected.\n\nThis was much the fate of our three travellers, only that they seemed to\nbe the better furnished for travelling, and had it in their view to go\nfarther off; for as to the first, they did not propose to go farther\nthan one day's journey, that so they might have intelligence every two\nor three days how things were at London.\n\nBut here our travellers found themselves under an unexpected\ninconvenience: namely that of their horse, for by means of the horse to\ncarry their baggage they were obliged to keep in the road, whereas the\npeople of this other band went over the fields or roads, path or no\npath, way or no way, as they pleased; neither had they any occasion to\npass through any town, or come near any town, other than to buy such\nthings as they wanted for their necessary subsistence, and in that\nindeed they were put to much difficulty; of which in its place.\n\nBut our three travellers were obliged to keep the road, or else they\nmust commit spoil, and do the country a great deal of damage in breaking\ndown fences and gates to go over enclosed fields, which they were loth\nto do if they could help it.\n\nOur three travellers, however, had a great mind to join themselves to\nthis company and take their lot with them; and after some discourse they\nlaid aside their first design which looked northward, and resolved to\nfollow the other into Essex; so in the morning they took up their tent\nand loaded their horse, and away they travelled all together.\n\nThey had some difficulty in passing the ferry at the river-side, the\nferryman being afraid of them; but after some parley at a distance, the\nferryman was content to bring his boat to a place distant from the usual\nferry, and leave it there for them to take it; so putting themselves\nover, he directed them to leave the boat, and he, having another boat,\nsaid he would fetch it again, which it seems, however, he did not do for\nabove eight days.\n\nHere, giving the ferryman money beforehand, they had a supply of\nvictuals and drink, which he brought and left in the boat for them; but\nnot without, as I said, having received the money beforehand. But now\nour travellers were at a great loss and difficulty how to get the horse\nover, the boat being small and not fit for it: and at last could not do\nit without unloading the baggage and making him swim over.\n\nFrom the river they travelled towards the forest, but when they came to\nWalthamstow the people of that town denied to admit them, as was the\ncase everywhere. The constables and their watchmen kept them off at a\ndistance and parleyed with them. They gave the same account of\nthemselves as before, but these gave no credit to what they said, giving\nit for a reason that two or three companies had already come that way\nand made the like pretences, but that they had given several people the\ndistemper in the towns where they had passed; and had been afterwards so\nhardly used by the country (though with justice, too, as they had\ndeserved) that about Brentwood, or that way, several of them perished in\nthe fields--whether of the plague or of mere want and distress they\ncould not tell.\n\nThis was a good reason indeed why the people of Walthamstow should be\nvery cautious, and why they should resolve not to entertain anybody that\nthey were not well satisfied of. But, as Richard the joiner and one of\nthe other men who parleyed with them told them, it was no reason why\nthey should block up the roads and refuse to let people pass through the\ntown, and who asked nothing of them but to go through the street; that\nif their people were afraid of them, they might go into their houses and\nshut their doors; they would neither show them civility nor incivility,\nbut go on about their business.\n\nThe constables and attendants, not to be persuaded by reason, continued\nobstinate, and would hearken to nothing; so the two men that talked with\nthem went back to their fellows to consult what was to be done. It was\nvery discouraging in the whole, and they knew not what to do for a good\nwhile; but at last John the soldier and biscuit-maker, considering a\nwhile, 'Come,' says he, 'leave the rest of the parley to me.' He had not\nappeared yet, so he sets the joiner, Richard, to work to cut some poles\nout of the trees and shape them as like guns as he could, and in a\nlittle time he had five or six fair muskets, which at a distance would\nnot be known; and about the part where the lock of a gun is he caused\nthem to wrap cloth and rags such as they had, as soldiers do in wet\nweather to preserve the locks of their pieces from rust; the rest was\ndiscoloured with clay or mud, such as they could get; and all this while\nthe rest of them sat under the trees by his direction, in two or three\nbodies, where they made fires at a good distance from one another.\n\nWhile this was doing he advanced himself and two or three with him, and\nset up their tent in the lane within sight of the barrier which the\ntown's men had made, and set a sentinel just by it with the real gun,\nthe only one they had, and who walked to and fro with the gun on his\nshoulder, so as that the people of the town might see them. Also, he\ntied the horse to a gate in the hedge just by, and got some dry sticks\ntogether and kindled a fire on the other side of the tent, so that the\npeople of the town could see the fire and the smoke, but could not see\nwhat they were doing at it.\n\nAfter the country people had looked upon them very earnestly a great\nwhile, and, by all that they could see, could not but suppose that they\nwere a great many in company, they began to be uneasy, not for their\ngoing away, but for staying where they were; and above all, perceiving\nthey had horses and arms, for they had seen one horse and one gun at the\ntent, and they had seen others of them walk about the field on the\ninside of the hedge by the side of the lane with their muskets, as they\ntook them to be, shouldered; I say, upon such a sight as this, you may\nbe assured they were alarmed and terribly frighted, and it seems they\nwent to a justice of the peace to know what they should do. What the\njustice advised them to I know not, but towards the evening they called\nfrom the barrier, as above, to the sentinel at the tent.\n\n'What do you want?' says John.*\n\n'Why, what do you intend to do?' says the constable. 'To do,' says John;\n'what would you have us to do?' Constable. Why don't you be gone? What\ndo you stay there for?\n\nJohn. Why do you stop us on the king's highway, and pretend to refuse us\nleave to go on our way?\n\nConstable. We are not bound to tell you our reason, though we did let\nyou know it was because of the plague.\n\nJohn. We told you we were all sound and free from the plague, which we\nwere not bound to have satisfied you of, and yet you pretend to stop us\non the highway.\n\nConstable. We have a right to stop it up, and our own safety obliges us\nto it. Besides, this is not the king's highway; 'tis a way upon\nsufferance. You see here is a gate, and if we do let people pass here,\nwe make them pay toll.\n\nJohn. We have a right to seek our own safety as well as you, and you may\nsee we are flying for our lives: and 'tis very unchristian and unjust to\nstop us.\n\nConstable. You may go back from whence you came; we do not hinder you\nfrom that.\n\nJohn. No; it is a stronger enemy than you that keeps us from doing that,\nor else we should not have come hither.\n\nConstable. Well, you may go any other way, then.\n\nJohn. No, no; I suppose you see we are able to send you going, and all\nthe people of your parish, and come through your town when we will; but\nsince you have stopped us here, we are content. You see we have encamped\nhere, and here we will live. We hope you will furnish us with victuals.\n\n\n     *It seems John was in the tent, but hearing them call, he\n     steps out, and taking the gun upon his shoulder, talked to\n     them as if he had been the sentinel placed there upon the\n     guard by some officer that was his superior. [Footnote in\n     the original.]\n\nConstable. We furnish you! What mean you by that?\n\nJohn. Why, you would not have us starve, would you? If you stop us here,\nyou must keep us.\n\nConstable. You will be ill kept at our maintenance.\n\nJohn. If you stint us, we shall make ourselves the better allowance.\n\nConstable. Why, you will not pretend to quarter upon us by force, will\nyou?\n\nJohn. We have offered no violence to you yet. Why do you seem to oblige\nus to it? I am an old soldier, and cannot starve, and if you think that\nwe shall be obliged to go back for want of provisions, you are mistaken.\n\nConstable. Since you threaten us, we shall take care to be strong enough\nfor you. I have orders to raise the county upon you.\n\nJohn. It is you that threaten, not we. And since you are for mischief,\nyou cannot blame us if we do not give you time for it; we shall begin\nour march in a few minutes.*\n\nConstable. What is it you demand of us?\n\nJohn. At first we desired nothing of you but leave to go through the\ntown; we should have offered no injury to any of you, neither would you\nhave had any injury or loss by us. We are not thieves, but poor people\nin distress, and flying from the dreadful plague in London, which\ndevours thousands every week. We wonder how you could be so unmerciful!\n\nConstable. Self-preservation obliges us.\n\nJohn. What! To shut up your compassion in a case of such distress as\nthis?\n\nConstable. Well, if you will pass over the fields on your left hand, and\nbehind that part of the town, I will endeavour to have gates opened for\nyou.\n\nJohn. Our horsemen ** cannot pass with our baggage that way; it does not\nlead into the road that we want to go, and why should you force us out\nof the road? Besides, you have kept us here all day without any\nprovisions but such as we brought with us. I think you ought to send us\nsome provisions for our relief.\n\n\n* This frighted the constable and the people that were with him, that\nthey immediately changed their note.\n\n** They had but one horse among them. [Footnotes in the original.]\n\nConstable. If you will go another way we will send you some provisions.\n\nJohn. That is the way to have all the towns in the county stop up the\nways against us.\n\nConstable. If they all furnish you with food, what will you be the\nworse? I see you have tents; you want no lodging.\n\nJohn. Well, what quantity of provisions will you send us?\n\nConstable. How many are you?\n\nJohn. Nay, we do not ask enough for all our company; we are in three\ncompanies. If you will send us bread for twenty men and about six or\nseven women for three days, and show us the way over the field you speak\nof, we desire not to put your people into any fear for us; we will go\nout of our way to oblige you, though we are as free from infection as\nyou are.*\n\nConstable. And will you assure us that your other people shall offer us\nno new disturbance?\n\nJohn. No, no you may depend on it.\n\nConstable. You must oblige yourself, too, that none of your people shall\ncome a step nearer than where the provisions we send you shall be set\ndown.\n\nJohn. I answer for it we will not.\n\nAccordingly they sent to the place twenty loaves of bread and three or\nfour large pieces of good beef, and opened some gates, through which\nthey passed; but none of them had courage so much as to look out to see\nthem go, and, as it was evening, if they had looked they could not have\nseen them as to know how few they were.\n\nThis was John the soldier's management. But this gave such an alarm to\nthe county, that had they really been two or three hundred the whole\ncounty would have been raised upon them, and they would have been sent\nto prison, or perhaps knocked on the head.\n\n\n* Here he called to one of his men, and bade him order Captain Richard\nand his people to march the lower way on the side of the marches, and\nmeet them in the forest; which was all a sham, for they had no Captain\nRichard, or any such company. [Footnote in the original.]\n\nThey were soon made sensible of this, for two days afterwards they found\nseveral parties of horsemen and footmen also about, in pursuit of three\ncompanies of men, armed, as they said, with muskets, who were broke out\nfrom London and had the plague upon them, and that were not only\nspreading the distemper among the people, but plundering the country.\n\nAs they saw now the consequence of their case, they soon saw the danger\nthey were in; so they resolved by the advice also of the old soldier to\ndivide themselves again. John and his two comrades, with the horse, went\naway, as if towards Waltham; the other in two companies, but all a\nlittle asunder, and went towards Epping.\n\nThe first night they encamped all in the forest, and not far off of one\nanother, but not setting up the tent, lest that should discover them. On\nthe other hand, Richard went to work with his axe and his hatchet, and\ncutting down branches of trees, he built three tents or hovels, in which\nthey all encamped with as much convenience as they could expect.\n\nThe provisions they had at Walthamstow served them very plentifully this\nnight; and as for the next, they left it to Providence. They had fared\nso well with the old soldier's conduct that they now willingly made him\ntheir leader, and the first of his conduct appeared to be very good. He\ntold them that they were now at a proper distance enough from London;\nthat as they need not be immediately beholden to the country for relief,\nso they ought to be as careful the country did not infect them as that\nthey did not infect the country; that what little money they had, they\nmust be as frugal of as they could; that as he would not have them think\nof offering the country any violence, so they must endeavour to make the\nsense of their condition go as far with the country as it could. They\nall referred themselves to his direction, so they left their three\nhouses standing, and the next day went away towards Epping. The captain\nalso (for so they now called him), and his two fellow-travellers, laid\naside their design of going to Waltham, and all went together.\n\nWhen they came near Epping they halted, choosing out a proper place in\nthe open forest, not very near the highway, but not far out of it on the\nnorth side, under a little cluster of low pollard-trees. Here they\npitched their little camp--which consisted of three large tents or huts\nmade of poles which their carpenter, and such as were his assistants,\ncut down and fixed in the ground in a circle, binding all the small ends\ntogether at the top and thickening the sides with boughs of trees and\nbushes, so that they were completely close and warm. They had, besides\nthis, a little tent where the women lay by themselves, and a hut to put\nthe horse in.\n\nIt happened that the next day, or next but one, was market-day at\nEpping, when Captain John and one of the other men went to market and\nbought some provisions; that is to say, bread, and some mutton and beef;\nand two of the women went separately, as if they had not belonged to the\nrest, and bought more. John took the horse to bring it home, and the\nsack which the carpenter carried his tools in, to put it in. The\ncarpenter went to work and made them benches and stools to sit on, such\nas the wood he could get would afford, and a kind of table to dine on.\n\nThey were taken no notice of for two or three days, but after that\nabundance of people ran out of the town to look at them, and all the\ncountry was alarmed about them. The people at first seemed afraid to\ncome near them; and, on the other hand, they desired the people to keep\noff, for there was a rumour that the plague was at Waltham, and that it\nhad been in Epping two or three days; so John called out to them not to\ncome to them, 'for,' says he, 'we are all whole and sound people here,\nand we would not have you bring the plague among us, nor pretend we\nbrought it among you.'\n\nAfter this the parish officers came up to them and parleyed with them at\na distance, and desired to know who they were, and by what authority\nthey pretended to fix their stand at that place. John answered very\nfrankly, they were poor distressed people from London who, foreseeing\nthe misery they should be reduced to if plague spread into the city, had\nfled out in time for their lives, and, having no acquaintance or\nrelations to fly to, had first taken up at Islington; but, the plague\nbeing come into that town, were fled farther; and as they supposed that\nthe people of Epping might have refused them coming into their town,\nthey had pitched their tents thus in the open field and in the forest,\nbeing willing to bear all the hardships of such a disconsolate lodging\nrather than have any one think or be afraid that they should receive\ninjury by them.\n\nAt first the Epping people talked roughly to them, and told them they\nmust remove; that this was no place for them; and that they pretended to\nbe sound and well, but that they might be infected with the plague for\naught they knew, and might infect the whole country, and they could not\nsuffer them there.\n\nJohn argued very calmly with them a great while, and told them that\nLondon was the place by which they--that is, the townsmen of Epping and\nall the country round them--subsisted; to whom they sold the produce of\ntheir lands, and out of whom they made their rent of their farms; and to\nbe so cruel to the inhabitants of London, or to any of those by whom\nthey gained so much, was very hard, and they would be loth to have it\nremembered hereafter, and have it told how barbarous, how inhospitable,\nand how unkind they were to the people of London when they fled from the\nface of the most terrible enemy in the world; that it would be enough to\nmake the name of an Epping man hateful through all the city, and to have\nthe rabble stone them in the very streets whenever they came so much as\nto market; that they were not yet secure from being visited themselves,\nand that, as he heard, Waltham was already; that they would think it\nvery hard that when any of them fled for fear before they were touched,\nthey should be denied the liberty of lying so much as in the open\nfields.\n\nThe Epping men told them again, that they, indeed, said they were sound\nand free from the infection, but that they had no assurance of it; and\nthat it was reported that there had been a great rabble of people at\nWalthamstow, who made such pretences of being sound as they did, but\nthat they threatened to plunder the town and force their way, whether\nthe parish officers would or no; that there were near two hundred of\nthem, and had arms and tents like Low Country soldiers; that they\nextorted provisions from the town, by threatening them with living upon\nthem at free quarter, showing their arms, and talking in the language of\nsoldiers; and that several of them being gone away toward Rumford and\nBrentwood, the country had been infected by them, and the plague spread\ninto both those large towns, so that the people durst not go to market\nthere as usual; that it was very likely they were some of that party;\nand if so, they deserved to be sent to the county jail, and be secured\ntill they had made satisfaction for the damage they had done, and for\nthe terror and fright they had put the country into.\n\nJohn answered that what other people had done was nothing to them; that\nthey assured them they were all of one company; that they had never been\nmore in number than they saw them at that time (which, by the way, was\nvery true); that they came out in two separate companies, but joined by\nthe way, their cases being the same; that they were ready to give what\naccount of themselves anybody could desire of them, and to give in their\nnames and places of abode, that so they might be called to an account\nfor any disorder that they might be guilty of; that the townsmen might\nsee they were content to live hardly, and only desired a little room to\nbreathe in on the forest where it was wholesome; for where it was not\nthey could not stay, and would decamp if they found it otherwise there.\n\n'But,' said the townsmen, 'we have a great charge of poor upon our hands\nalready, and we must take care not to increase it; we suppose you can\ngive us no security against your being chargeable to our parish and to\nthe inhabitants, any more than you can of being dangerous to us as to\nthe infection.'\n\n'Why, look you,' says John, 'as to being chargeable to you, we hope we\nshall not. If you will relieve us with provisions for our present\nnecessity, we will be very thankful; as we all lived without charity\nwhen we were at home, so we will oblige ourselves fully to repay you, if\nGod pleases to bring us back to our own families and houses in safety,\nand to restore health to the people of London.\n\n'As to our dying here: we assure you, if any of us die, we that survive\nwill bury them, and put you to no expense, except it should be that we\nshould all die; and then, indeed, the last man not being able to bury\nhimself, would put you to that single expense which I am persuaded',\nsays John, 'he would leave enough behind him to pay you for the expense\nof.\n\n'On the other hand,' says John, 'if you shut up all bowels of\ncompassion, and not relieve us at all, we shall not extort anything by\nviolence or steal from any one; but when what little we have is spent,\nif we perish for want, God's will be done.'\n\nJohn wrought so upon the townsmen, by talking thus rationally and\nsmoothly to them, that they went away; and though they did not give any\nconsent to their staying there, yet they did not molest them; and the\npoor people continued there three or four days longer without any\ndisturbance. In this time they had got some remote acquaintance with a\nvictualling-house at the outskirts of the town, to whom they called at a\ndistance to bring some little things that they wanted, and which they\ncaused to be set down at a distance, and always paid for very honestly.\n\nDuring this time the younger people of the town came frequently pretty\nnear them, and would stand and look at them, and sometimes talk with\nthem at some space between; and particularly it was observed that the\nfirst Sabbath-day the poor people kept retired, worshipped God together,\nand were heard to sing psalms.\n\nThese things, and a quiet, inoffensive behaviour, began to get them the\ngood opinion of the country, and people began to pity them and speak\nvery well of them; the consequence of which was, that upon the occasion\nof a very wet, rainy night, a certain gentleman who lived in the\nneighbourhood sent them a little cart with twelve trusses or bundles of\nstraw, as well for them to lodge upon as to cover and thatch their huts\nand to keep them dry. The minister of a parish not far off, not knowing\nof the other, sent them also about two bushels of wheat and half a\nbushel of white peas.\n\nThey were very thankful, to be sure, for this relief, and particularly\nthe straw was a--very great comfort to them; for though the ingenious\ncarpenter had made frames for them to lie in like troughs, and filled\nthem with leaves of trees, and such things as they could get, and had\ncut all their tent-cloth out to make them coverlids, yet they lay damp\nand hard and unwholesome till this straw came, which was to them like\nfeather-beds, and, as John said, more welcome than feather-beds would\nhave been at another time.\n\nThis gentleman and the minister having thus begun, and given an example\nof charity to these wanderers, others quickly followed, and they\nreceived every day some benevolence or other from the people, but\nchiefly from the gentlemen who dwelt in the country round them. Some\nsent them chairs, stools, tables, and such household things as they gave\nnotice they wanted; some sent them blankets, rugs, and coverlids, some\nearthenware, and some kitchen ware for ordering their food.\n\nEncouraged by this good usage, their carpenter in a few days built them\na large shed or house with rafters, and a roof in form, and an upper\nfloor, in which they lodged warm: for the weather began to be damp and\ncold in the beginning of September. But this house, being well thatched,\nand the sides and roof made very thick, kept out the cold well enough.\nHe made, also, an earthen wall at one end with a chimney in it, and\nanother of the company, with a vast deal of trouble and pains, made a\nfunnel to the chimney to carry out the smoke.\n\nHere they lived comfortably, though coarsely, till the beginning of\nSeptember, when they had the bad news to hear, whether true or not, that\nthe plague, which was very hot at Waltham Abbey on one side and at\nRumford and Brentwood on the other side, was also coming to Epping, to\nWoodford, and to most of the towns upon the Forest, and which, as they\nsaid, was brought down among them chiefly by the higlers, and such\npeople as went to and from London with provisions.\n\nIf this was true, it was an evident contradiction to that report which\nwas afterwards spread all over England, but which, as I have said, I\ncannot confirm of my own knowledge: namely, that the market-people\ncarrying provisions to the city never got the infection or carried it\nback into the country; both which, I have been assured, has been false.\n\nIt might be that they were preserved even beyond expectation, though not\nto a miracle, that abundance went and came and were not touched; and\nthat was much for the encouragement of the poor people of London, who\nhad been completely miserable if the people that brought provisions to\nthe markets had not been many times wonderfully preserved, or at least\nmore preserved than could be reasonably expected.\n\nBut now these new inmates began to be disturbed more effectually, for\nthe towns about them were really infected, and they began to be afraid\nto trust one another so much as to go abroad for such things as they\nwanted, and this pinched them very hard, for now they had little or\nnothing but what the charitable gentlemen of the country supplied them\nwith. But, for their encouragement, it happened that other gentlemen in\nthe country who had not sent them anything before, began to hear of them\nand supply them, and one sent them a large pig--that is to say, a\nporker--another two sheep, and another sent them a calf. In short, they\nhad meat enough, and sometimes had cheese and milk, and all such things.\nThey were chiefly put to it for bread, for when the gentlemen sent them\ncorn they had nowhere to bake it or to grind it. This made them eat the\nfirst two bushel of wheat that was sent them in parched corn, as the\nIsraelites of old did, without grinding or making bread of it.\n\nAt last they found means to carry their corn to a windmill near\nWoodford, where they had it ground, and afterwards the biscuit-maker\nmade a hearth so hollow and dry that he could bake biscuit-cakes\ntolerably well; and thus they came into a condition to live without any\nassistance or supplies from the towns; and it was well they did, for the\ncountry was soon after fully infected, and about 120 were said to have\ndied of the distemper in the villages near them, which was a terrible\nthing to them.\n\nOn this they called a new council, and now the towns had no need to be\nafraid they should settle near them; but, on the contrary, several\nfamilies of the poorer sort of the inhabitants quitted their houses and\nbuilt huts in the forest after the same manner as they had done. But it\nwas observed that several of these poor people that had so removed had\nthe sickness even in their huts or booths; the reason of which was\nplain, namely, not because they removed into the air, but, (1) because\nthey did not remove time enough; that is to say, not till, by openly\nconversing with the other people their neighbours, they had the\ndistemper upon them, or (as may be said) among them, and so carried it\nabout them whither they went. Or (2) because they were not careful\nenough, after they were safely removed out of the towns, not to come in\nagain and mingle with the diseased people.\n\nBut be it which of these it will, when our travellers began to perceive\nthat the plague was not only in the towns, but even in the tents and\nhuts on the forest near them, they began then not only to be afraid, but\nto think of decamping and removing; for had they stayed they would have\nbeen in manifest danger of their lives.\n\nIt is not to be wondered that they were greatly afflicted at being\nobliged to quit the place where they had been so kindly received, and\nwhere they had been treated with so much humanity and charity; but\nnecessity and the hazard of life, which they came out so far to\npreserve, prevailed with them, and they saw no remedy. John, however,\nthought of a remedy for their present misfortune: namely, that he would\nfirst acquaint that gentleman who was their principal benefactor with\nthe distress they were in, and to crave his assistance and advice.\n\nThe good, charitable gentleman encouraged them to quit the Place for\nfear they should be cut off from any retreat at all by the violence of\nthe distemper; but whither they should go, that he found very hard to\ndirect them to. At last John asked of him whether he, being a justice of\nthe peace, would give them certificates of health to other justices whom\nthey might come before; that so whatever might be their lot, they might\nnot be repulsed now they had been also so long from London. This his\nworship immediately granted, and gave them proper letters of health, and\nfrom thence they were at liberty to travel whither they pleased.\n\nAccordingly they had a full certificate of health, intimating that they\nhad resided in a village in the county of Essex so long that, being\nexamined and scrutinised sufficiently, and having been retired from all\nconversation for above forty days, without any appearance of sickness,\nthey were therefore certainly concluded to be sound men, and might be\nsafely entertained anywhere, having at last removed rather for fear of\nthe plague which was come into such a town, rather than for having any\nsignal of infection upon them, or upon any belonging to them.\n\nWith this certificate they removed, though with great reluctance; and\nJohn inclining not to go far from home, they moved towards the marshes\non the side of Waltham. But here they found a man who, it seems, kept a\nweir or stop upon the river, made to raise the water for the barges\nwhich go up and down the river, and he terrified them with dismal\nstories of the sickness having been spread into all the towns on the\nriver and near the river, on the side of Middlesex and Hertfordshire;\nthat is to say, into Waltham, Waltham Cross, Enfield, and Ware, and all\nthe towns on the road, that they were afraid to go that way; though it\nseems the man imposed upon them, for that the thing was not really true.\n\nHowever, it terrified them, and they resolved to move across the forest\ntowards Rumford and Brentwood; but they heard that there were numbers of\npeople fled out of London that way, who lay up and down in the forest\ncalled Henalt Forest, reaching near Rumford, and who, having no\nsubsistence or habitation, not only lived oddly and suffered great\nextremities in the woods and fields for want of relief, but were said to\nbe made so desperate by those extremities as that they offered many\nviolences to the county, robbed and plundered, and killed cattle, and\nthe like; that others, building huts and hovels by the roadside, begged,\nand that with an importunity next door to demanding relief; so that the\ncounty was very uneasy, and had been obliged to take some of them up.\n\nThis in the first place intimated to them, that they would be sure to\nfind the charity and kindness of the county, which they had found here\nwhere they were before, hardened and shut up against them; and that, on\nthe other hand, they would be questioned wherever they came, and would\nbe in danger of violence from others in like cases as themselves.\n\nUpon all these considerations John, their captain, in all their names,\nwent back to their good friend and benefactor, who had relieved them\nbefore, and laying their case truly before him, humbly asked his advice;\nand he as kindly advised them to take up their old quarters again, or if\nnot, to remove but a little farther out of the road, and directed them\nto a proper place for them; and as they really wanted some house rather\nthan huts to shelter them at that time of the year, it growing on\ntowards Michaelmas, they found an old decayed house which had been\nformerly some cottage or little habitation but was so out of repair as\nscarce habitable; and by the consent of a farmer to whose farm it\nbelonged, they got leave to make what use of it they could.\n\nThe ingenious joiner, and all the rest, by his directions went to work\nwith it, and in a very few days made it capable to shelter them all in\ncase of bad weather; and in which there was an old chimney and old oven,\nthough both lying in ruins; yet they made them both fit for use, and,\nraising additions, sheds, and leantos on every side, they soon made the\nhouse capable to hold them all.\n\nThey chiefly wanted boards to make window-shutters, floors, doors, and\nseveral other things; but as the gentlemen above favoured them, and the\ncountry was by that means made easy with them, and above all, that they\nwere known to be all sound and in good health, everybody helped them\nwith what they could spare.\n\nHere they encamped for good and all, and resolved to remove no more.\nThey saw plainly how terribly alarmed that county was everywhere at\nanybody that came from London, and that they should have no admittance\nanywhere but with the utmost difficulty; at least no friendly reception\nand assistance as they had received here.\n\nNow, although they received great assistance and encouragement from the\ncountry gentlemen and from the people round about them, yet they were\nput to great straits: for the weather grew cold and wet in October and\nNovember, and they had not been used to so much hardship; so that they\ngot colds in their limbs, and distempers, but never had the infection;\nand thus about December they came home to the city again.\n\nI give this story thus at large, principally to give an account what\nbecame of the great numbers of people which immediately appeared in the\ncity as soon as the sickness abated; for, as I have said, great numbers\nof those that were able and had retreats in the country fled to those\nretreats. So, when it was increased to such a frightful extremity as I\nhave related, the middling people who had not friends fled to all parts\nof the country where they could get shelter, as well those that had\nmoney to relieve themselves as those that had not. Those that had money\nalways fled farthest, because they were able to subsist themselves; but\nthose who were empty suffered, as I have said, great hardships, and were\noften driven by necessity to relieve their wants at the expense of the\ncountry. By that means the country was made very uneasy at them, and\nsometimes took them up; though even then they scarce knew what to do\nwith them, and were always very backward to punish them, but often, too,\nthey forced them from place to place till they were obliged to come back\nagain to London.\n\nI have, since my knowing this story of John and his brother, inquired\nand found that there were a great many of the poor disconsolate people,\nas above, fled into the country every way; and some of them got little\nsheds and barns and outhouses to live in, where they could obtain so\nmuch kindness of the country, and especially where they had any the\nleast satisfactory account to give of themselves, and particularly that\nthey did not come out of London too late. But others, and that in great\nnumbers, built themselves little huts and retreats in the fields and\nwoods, and lived like hermits in holes and caves, or any place they\ncould find, and where, we may be sure, they suffered great extremities,\nsuch that many of them were obliged to come back again whatever the\ndanger was; and so those little huts were often found empty, and the\ncountry people supposed the inhabitants lay dead in them of the plague,\nand would not go near them for fear--no, not in a great while; nor is it\nunlikely but that some of the unhappy wanderers might die so all alone,\neven sometimes for want of help, as particularly in one tent or hut was\nfound a man dead, and on the gate of a field just by was cut with his\nknife in uneven letters the following words, by which it may be supposed\nthe other man escaped, or that, one dying first, the other buried him as\nwell as he could:--\n\n\n     O mIsErY!\n     We BoTH ShaLL DyE,\n     WoE, WoE.\n\nI have given an account already of what I found to have been the case\ndown the river among the seafaring men; how the ships lay in the offing,\nas it's called, in rows or lines astern of one another, quite down from\nthe Pool as far as I could see. I have been told that they lay in the\nsame manner quite down the river as low as Gravesend, and some far\nbeyond: even everywhere or in every place where they could ride with\nsafety as to wind and weather; nor did I ever hear that the plague\nreached to any of the people on board those ships--except such as lay up\nin the Pool, or as high as Deptford Reach, although the people went\nfrequently on shore to the country towns and villages and farmers'\nhouses, to buy fresh provisions, fowls, pigs, calves, and the like for\ntheir supply.\n\nLikewise I found that the watermen on the river above the bridge found\nmeans to convey themselves away up the river as far as they could go,\nand that they had, many of them, their whole families in their boats,\ncovered with tilts and bales, as they call them, and furnished with\nstraw within for their lodging, and that they lay thus all along by the\nshore in the marshes, some of them setting up little tents with their\nsails, and so lying under them on shore in the day, and going into their\nboats at night; and in this manner, as I have heard, the river-sides\nwere lined with boats and people as long as they had anything to subsist\non, or could get anything of the country; and indeed the country people,\nas well Gentlemen as others, on these and all other occasions, were very\nforward to relieve them--but they were by no means willing to receive\nthem into their towns and houses, and for that we cannot blame them.\n\nThere was one unhappy citizen within my knowledge who had been visited\nin a dreadful manner, so that his wife and all his children were dead,\nand himself and two servants only left, with an elderly woman, a near\nrelation, who had nursed those that were dead as well as she could. This\ndisconsolate man goes to a village near the town, though not within the\nbills of mortality, and finding an empty house there, inquires out the\nowner, and took the house. After a few days he got a cart and loaded it\nwith goods, and carries them down to the house; the people of the\nvillage opposed his driving the cart along; but with some arguings and\nsome force, the men that drove the cart along got through the street up\nto the door of the house. There the constable resisted them again, and\nwould not let them be brought in. The man caused the goods to be\nunloaden and laid at the door, and sent the cart away; upon which they\ncarried the man before a justice of peace; that is to say, they\ncommanded him to go, which he did. The justice ordered him to cause the\ncart to fetch away the goods again, which he refused to do; upon which\nthe justice ordered the constable to pursue the carters and fetch them\nback, and make them reload the goods and carry them away, or to set them\nin the stocks till they came for further orders; and if they could not\nfind them, nor the man would not consent to take them away, they should\ncause them to be drawn with hooks from the house-door and burned in the\nstreet. The poor distressed man upon this fetched the goods again, but\nwith grievous cries and lamentations at the hardship of his case. But\nthere was no remedy; self-preservation obliged the people to those\nseverities which they would not otherwise have been concerned in.\nWhether this poor man lived or died I cannot tell, but it was reported\nthat he had the plague upon him at that time; and perhaps the people\nmight report that to justify their usage of him; but it was not unlikely\nthat either he or his goods, or both, were dangerous, when his whole\nfamily had been dead of the distempers so little a while before.\n\nI know that the inhabitants of the towns adjacent to London were much\nblamed for cruelty to the poor people that ran from the contagion in\ntheir distress, and many very severe things were done, as may be seen\nfrom what has been said; but I cannot but say also that, where there was\nroom for charity and assistance to the people, without apparent danger\nto themselves, they were willing enough to help and relieve them. But as\nevery town were indeed judges in their own case, so the poor people who\nran abroad in their extremities were often ill-used and driven back\nagain into the town; and this caused infinite exclamations and outcries\nagainst the country towns, and made the clamour very popular.\n\nAnd yet, more or less, (with) all the caution, there was not a town of\nany note within ten (or, I believe, twenty) miles of the city but what\nwas more or less infected and had some died among them. I have heard the\naccounts of several, such as they were reckoned up, as follows:--\n\n\n     In Enfield           32          In Uxbridge        117\n     \"  Hornsey           58               \"  Hertford    90\n     \"  Newington         17          \"  Ware            160\n     \"  Tottenham         42          \"  Hodsdon          30\n     \"  Edmonton          19          \"  Waltham Abbey    23\n     \"  Barnet and Hadly  19          \"  Epping           26\n     \"  St Albans        121          \"  Deptford        623\n     \"  Watford           45          \"  Greenwich       231\n     \"  Eltham and Lusum  85          \"  Kingston        122\n     \"  Croydon           61          \"  Stanes           82\n     \"  Brentwood         70          \"  Chertsey         18\n     \"  Rumford          109          \"  Windsor         103\n     \"  Barking Abbot    200\n     \"  Brentford        432                       Cum aliis.\n\nAnother thing might render the country more strict with respect to the\ncitizens, and especially with respect to the poor, and this was what I\nhinted at before: namely, that there was a seeming propensity or a\nwicked inclination in those that were infected to infect others.\n\nThere have been great debates among our physicians as to the reason of\nthis. Some will have it to be in the nature of the disease, and that it\nimpresses every one that is seized upon by it with a kind of a rage, and\na hatred against their own kind--as if there was a malignity not only in\nthe distemper to communicate itself, but in the very nature of man,\nprompting him with evil will or an evil eye, that, as they say in the\ncase of a mad dog, who though the gentlest creature before of any of his\nkind, yet then will fly upon and bite any one that comes next him, and\nthose as soon as any who had been most observed by him before.\n\nOthers placed it to the account of the corruption of human nature, who\ncannot bear to see itself more miserable than others of its own species,\nand has a kind of involuntary wish that all men were as unhappy or in as\nbad a condition as itself.\n\nOthers say it was only a kind of desperation, not knowing or regarding\nwhat they did, and consequently unconcerned at the danger or safety not\nonly of anybody near them, but even of themselves also. And indeed, when\nmen are once come to a condition to abandon themselves, and be\nunconcerned for the safety or at the danger of themselves, it cannot be\nso much wondered that they should be careless of the safety of other\npeople.\n\nBut I choose to give this grave debate a quite different turn, and\nanswer it or resolve it all by saying that I do not grant the fact. On\nthe contrary, I say that the thing is not really so, but that it was a\ngeneral complaint raised by the people inhabiting the outlying villages\nagainst the citizens to justify, or at least excuse, those hardships and\nseverities so much talked of, and in which complaints both sides may be\nsaid to have injured one another; that is to say, the citizens pressing\nto be received and harboured in time of distress, and with the plague\nupon them, complain of the cruelty and injustice of the country people\nin being refused entrance and forced back again with their goods and\nfamilies; and the inhabitants, finding themselves so imposed upon, and\nthe citizens breaking in as it were upon them whether they would or no,\ncomplain that when they were infected they were not only regardless of\nothers, but even willing to infect them; neither of which were really\ntrue--that is to say, in the colours they were described in.\n\nIt is true there is something to be said for the frequent alarms which\nwere given to the country of the resolution of the people of London to\ncome out by force, not only for relief, but to plunder and rob; that\nthey ran about the streets with the distemper upon them without any\ncontrol; and that no care was taken to shut up houses, and confine the\nsick people from infecting others; whereas, to do the Londoners justice,\nthey never practised such things, except in such particular cases as I\nhave mentioned above, and such like. On the other hand, everything was\nmanaged with so much care, and such excellent order was observed in the\nwhole city and suburbs by the care of the Lord Mayor and aldermen and by\nthe justices of the peace, church-wardens, &c., in the outparts, that\nLondon may be a pattern to all the cities in the world for the good\ngovernment and the excellent order that was everywhere kept, even in the\ntime of the most violent infection, and when the people were in the\nutmost consternation and distress. But of this I shall speak by itself.\n\nOne thing, it is to be observed, was owing principally to the prudence\nof the magistrates, and ought to be mentioned to their honour: viz., the\nmoderation which they used in the great and difficult work of shutting\nup of houses. It is true, as I have mentioned, that the shutting up of\nhouses was a great subject of discontent, and I may say indeed the only\nsubject of discontent among the people at that time; for the confining\nthe sound in the same house with the sick was counted very terrible, and\nthe complaints of people so confined were very grievous. They were heard\ninto the very streets, and they were sometimes such that called for\nresentment, though oftener for compassion. They had no way to converse\nwith any of their friends but out at their windows, where they would\nmake such piteous lamentations as often moved the hearts of those they\ntalked with, and of others who, passing by, heard their story; and as\nthose complaints oftentimes reproached the severity, and sometimes the\ninsolence, of the watchmen placed at their doors, those watchmen would\nanswer saucily enough, and perhaps be apt to affront the people who were\nin the street talking to the said families; for which, or for their ill-\ntreatment of the families, I think seven or eight of them in several\nplaces were killed; I know not whether I should say murdered or not,\nbecause I cannot enter into the particular cases. It is true the\nwatchmen were on their duty, and acting in the post where they were\nplaced by a lawful authority; and killing any public legal officer in\nthe execution of his office is always, in the language of the law,\ncalled murder. But as they were not authorised by the magistrates'\ninstructions, or by the power they acted under, to be injurious or\nabusive either to the people who were under their observation or to any\nthat concerned themselves for them; so when they did so, they might be\nsaid to act themselves, not their office; to act as private persons, not\nas persons employed; and consequently, if they brought mischief upon\nthemselves by such an undue behaviour, that mischief was upon their own\nheads; and indeed they had so much the hearty curses of the people,\nwhether they deserved it or not, that whatever befell them nobody pitied\nthem, and everybody was apt to say they deserved it, whatever it was.\nNor do I remember that anybody was ever punished, at least to any\nconsiderable degree, for whatever was done to the watchmen that guarded\ntheir houses.\n\nWhat variety of stratagems were used to escape and get out of houses\nthus shut up, by which the watchmen were deceived or overpowered, and\nthat the people got away, I have taken notice of already, and shall say\nno more to that. But I say the magistrates did moderate and ease\nfamilies upon many occasions in this case, and particularly in that of\ntaking away, or suffering to be removed, the sick persons out of such\nhouses when they were willing to be removed either to a pest-house or\nother Places; and sometimes giving the well persons in the family so\nshut up, leave to remove upon information given that they were well, and\nthat they would confine themselves in such houses where they went so\nlong as should be required of them. The concern, also, of the\nmagistrates for the supplying such poor families as were infected--I\nsay, supplying them with necessaries, as well physic as food--was very\ngreat, and in which they did not content themselves with giving the\nnecessary orders to the officers appointed, but the aldermen in person,\nand on horseback, frequently rode to such houses and caused the people\nto be asked at their windows whether they were duly attended or not;\nalso, whether they wanted anything that was necessary, and if the\nofficers had constantly carried their messages and fetched them such\nthings as they wanted or not. And if they answered in the affirmative,\nall was well; but if they complained that they were ill supplied, and\nthat the officer did not do his duty, or did not treat them civilly,\nthey (the officers) were generally removed, and others placed in their\nstead.\n\nIt is true such complaint might be unjust, and if the officer had such\narguments to use as would convince the magistrate that he was right, and\nthat the people had injured him, he was continued and they reproved. But\nthis part could not well bear a particular inquiry, for the parties\ncould very ill be well heard and answered in the street from the\nwindows, as was the case then. The magistrates, therefore, generally\nchose to favour the people and remove the man, as what seemed to be the\nleast wrong and of the least ill consequence; seeing if the watchman was\ninjured, yet they could easily make him amends by giving him another\npost of the like nature; but if the family was injured, there was no\nsatisfaction could be made to them, the damage perhaps being\nirreparable, as it concerned their lives.\n\nA great variety of these cases frequently happened between the watchmen\nand the poor people shut up, besides those I formerly mentioned about\nescaping. Sometimes the watchmen were absent, sometimes drunk, sometimes\nasleep when the people wanted them, and such never failed to be punished\nseverely, as indeed they deserved.\n\nBut after all that was or could be done in these cases, the shutting up\nof houses, so as to confine those that were well with those that were\nsick, had very great inconveniences in it, and some that were very\ntragical, and which merited to have been considered if there had been\nroom for it. But it was authorised by a law, it had the public good in\nview as the end chiefly aimed at, and all the private injuries that were\ndone by the putting it in execution must be put to the account of the\npublic benefit.\n\nIt is doubtful to this day whether, in the whole, it contributed\nanything to the stop of the infection; and indeed I cannot say it did,\nfor nothing could run with greater fury and rage than the infection did\nwhen it was in its chief violence, though the houses infected were shut\nup as exactly and as effectually as it was possible. Certain it is that\nif all the infected persons were effectually shut in, no sound person\ncould have been infected by them, because they could not have come near\nthem. But the case was this (and I shall only touch it here): namely,\nthat the infection was propagated insensibly, and by such persons as\nwere not visibly infected, who neither knew whom they infected or who\nthey were infected by.\n\nA house in Whitechappel was shut up for the sake of one infected maid,\nwho had only spots, not the tokens come out upon her, and recovered; yet\nthese people obtained no liberty to stir, neither for air or exercise,\nforty days. Want of breath, fear, anger, vexation, and all the other\ngifts attending such an injurious treatment cast the mistress of the\nfamily into a fever, and visitors came into the house and said it was\nthe plague, though the physicians declared it was not. However, the\nfamily were obliged to begin their quarantine anew on the report of the\nvisitors or examiner, though their former quarantine wanted but a few\ndays of being finished. This oppressed them so with anger and grief,\nand, as before, straitened them also so much as to room, and for want of\nbreathing and free air, that most of the family fell sick, one of one\ndistemper, one of another, chiefly scorbutic ailments; only one, a\nviolent colic; till, after several prolongings of their confinement,\nsome or other of those that came in with the visitors to inspect the\npersons that were ill, in hopes of releasing them, brought the distemper\nwith them and infected the whole house; and all or most of them died,\nnot of the plague as really upon them before, but of the plague that\nthose people brought them, who should have been careful to have\nprotected them from it. And this was a thing which frequently happened,\nand was indeed one of the worst consequences of shutting houses up.\n\nI had about this time a little hardship put upon me, which I was at\nfirst greatly afflicted at, and very much disturbed about though, as it\nproved, it did not expose me to any disaster; and this was being\nappointed by the alderman of Portsoken Ward one of the examiners of the\nhouses in the precinct where I lived. We had a large parish, and had no\nless than eighteen examiners, as the order called us; the people called\nus visitors. I endeavoured with all my might to be excused from such an\nemployment, and used many arguments with the alderman's deputy to be\nexcused; particularly I alleged that I was against shutting up houses at\nall, and that it would be very hard to oblige me to be an instrument in\nthat which was against my judgement, and which I did verily believe\nwould not answer the end it was intended for; but all the abatement I\ncould get was only, that whereas the officer was appointed by my Lord\nMayor to continue two months, I should be obliged to hold it but three\nweeks, on condition nevertheless that I could then get some other\nsufficient housekeeper to serve the rest of the time for me--which was,\nin short, but a very small favour, it being very difficult to get any\nman to accept of such an employment, that was fit to be entrusted with\nit.\n\nIt is true that shutting up of houses had one effect, which I am\nsensible was of moment, namely, it confined the distempered people, who\nwould otherwise have been both very troublesome and very dangerous in\ntheir running about streets with the distemper upon them--which, when\nthey were delirious, they would have done in a most frightful manner,\nand as indeed they began to do at first very much, till they were thus\nrestrained; nay, so very open they were that the poor would go about and\nbeg at people's doors, and say they had the plague upon them, and beg\nrags for their sores, or both, or anything that delirious nature\nhappened to think of.\n\nA poor, unhappy gentlewoman, a substantial citizen's wife, was (if the\nstory be true) murdered by one of these creatures in Aldersgate Street,\nor that way. He was going along the street, raving mad to be sure, and\nsinging; the people only said he was drunk, but he himself said he had\nthe plague upon him, which it seems was true; and meeting this\ngentlewoman, he would kiss her. She was terribly frighted, as he was\nonly a rude fellow, and she ran from him, but the street being very thin\nof people, there was nobody near enough to help her. When she saw he\nwould overtake her, she turned and gave him a thrust so forcibly, he\nbeing but weak, and pushed him down backward. But very unhappily, she\nbeing so near, he caught hold of her and pulled her down also, and\ngetting up first, mastered her and kissed her; and which was worst of\nall, when he had done, told her he had the plague, and why should not\nshe have it as well as he? She was frighted enough before, being also\nyoung with child; but when she heard him say he had the plague, she\nscreamed out and fell down into a swoon, or in a fit, which, though she\nrecovered a little, yet killed her in a very few days; and I never heard\nwhether she had the plague or no.\n\nAnother infected person came and knocked at the door of a citizen's\nhouse where they knew him very well; the servant let him in, and being\ntold the master of the house was above, he ran up and came into the room\nto them as the whole family was at supper. They began to rise up, a\nlittle surprised, not knowing what the matter was; but he bid them sit\nstill, he only came to take his leave of them. They asked him, 'Why, Mr-\n-, where are you going?' 'Going,' says he; 'I have got the sickness, and\nshall die tomorrow night.' 'Tis easy to believe, though not to describe,\nthe consternation they were all in. The women and the man's daughters,\nwhich were but little girls, were frighted almost to death and got up,\none running out at one door and one at another, some downstairs and some\nupstairs, and getting together as well as they could, locked themselves\ninto their chambers and screamed out at the window for help, as if they\nhad been frighted out of their wits. The master, more composed than\nthey, though both frighted and provoked, was going to lay hands on him\nand throw him downstairs, being in a passion; but then, considering a\nlittle the condition of the man and the danger of touching him, horror\nseized his mind, and he stood still like one astonished. The poor\ndistempered man all this while, being as well diseased in his brain as\nin his body, stood still like one amazed. At length he turns round:\n'Ay!' says he, with all the seeming calmness imaginable, 'is it so with\nyou all? Are you all disturbed at me? Why, then I'll e'en go home and\ndie there.' And so he goes immediately downstairs. The servant that had\nlet him in goes down after him with a candle, but was afraid to go past\nhim and open the door, so he stood on the stairs to see what he would\ndo. The man went and opened the door, and went out and flung the door\nafter him. It was some while before the family recovered the fright, but\nas no ill consequence attended, they have had occasion since to speak of\nit (You may be sure) with great satisfaction. Though the man was gone,\nit was some time--nay, as I heard, some days before they recovered\nthemselves of the hurry they were in; nor did they go up and down the\nhouse with any assurance till they had burnt a great variety of fumes\nand perfumes in all the rooms, and made a great many smokes of pitch, of\ngunpowder, and of sulphur, all separately shifted, and washed their\nclothes, and the like. As to the poor man, whether he lived or died I\ndon't remember.\n\nIt is most certain that, if by the shutting up of houses the sick had\nnot been confined, multitudes who in the height of their fever were\ndelirious and distracted would have been continually running up and down\nthe streets; and even as it was a very great number did so, and offered\nall sorts of violence to those they met, even just as a mad dog runs on\nand bites at every one he meets; nor can I doubt but that, should one of\nthose infected, diseased creatures have bitten any man or woman while\nthe frenzy of the distemper was upon them, they, I mean the person so\nwounded, would as certainly have been incurably infected as one that was\nsick before, and had the tokens upon him.\n\nI heard of one infected creature who, running out of his bed in his\nshirt in the anguish and agony of his swellings, of which he had three\nupon him, got his shoes on and went to put on his coat; but the nurse\nresisting, and snatching the coat from him, he threw her down, ran over\nher, ran downstairs and into the street, directly to the Thames in his\nshirt; the nurse running after him, and calling to the watch to stop\nhim; but the watchman, frighted at the man, and afraid to touch him, let\nhim go on; upon which he ran down to the Stillyard stairs, threw away\nhis shirt, and plunged into the Thames, and, being a good swimmer, swam\nquite over the river; and the tide being coming in, as they call it\n(that is, running westward) he reached the land not till he came about\nthe Falcon stairs, where landing, and finding no people there, it being\nin the night, he ran about the streets there, naked as he was, for a\ngood while, when, it being by that time high water, he takes the river\nagain, and swam back to the Stillyard, landed, ran up the streets again\nto his own house, knocking at the door, went up the stairs and into his\nbed again; and that this terrible experiment cured him of the plague,\nthat is to say, that the violent motion of his arms and legs stretched\nthe parts where the swellings he had upon him were, that is to say,\nunder his arms and his groin, and caused them to ripen and break; and\nthat the cold of the water abated the fever in his blood.\n\nI have only to add that I do not relate this any more than some of the\nother, as a fact within my own knowledge, so as that I can vouch the\ntruth of them, and especially that of the man being cured by the\nextravagant adventure, which I confess I do not think very possible; but\nit may serve to confirm the many desperate things which the distressed\npeople falling into deliriums, and what we call light-headedness, were\nfrequently run upon at that time, and how infinitely more such there\nwould have been if such people had not been confined by the shutting up\nof houses; and this I take to be the best, if not the only good thing\nwhich was performed by that severe method.\n\nOn the other hand, the complaints and the murmurings were very bitter\nagainst the thing itself. It would pierce the hearts of all that came by\nto hear the piteous cries of those infected people, who, being thus out\nof their understandings by the violence of their pain or the heat of\ntheir blood, were either shut in or perhaps tied in their beds and\nchairs, to prevent their doing themselves hurt--and who would make a\ndreadful outcry at their being confined, and at their being not\npermitted to die at large, as they called it, and as they would have\ndone before.\n\nThis running of distempered people about the streets was very dismal,\nand the magistrates did their utmost to prevent it; but as it was\ngenerally in the night and always sudden when such attempts were made,\nthe officers could not be at hand to prevent it; and even when any got\nout in the day, the officers appointed did not care to meddle with them,\nbecause, as they were all grievously infected, to be sure, when they\nwere come to that height, so they were more than ordinarily infectious,\nand it was one of the most dangerous things that could be to touch them.\nOn the other hand, they generally ran on, not knowing what they did,\ntill they dropped down stark dead, or till they had exhausted their\nspirits so as that they would fall and then die in perhaps half-an-hour\nor an hour; and, which was most piteous to hear, they were sure to come\nto themselves entirely in that half-hour or hour, and then to make most\ngrievous and piercing cries and lamentations in the deep, afflicting\nsense of the condition they were in. This was much of it before the\norder for shutting up of houses was strictly put in execution, for at\nfirst the watchmen were not so vigorous and severe as they were\nafterward in the keeping the people in; that is to say, before they were\n(I mean some of them) severely punished for their neglect, failing in\ntheir duty, and letting people who were under their care slip away, or\nconniving at their going abroad, whether sick or well. But after they\nsaw the officers appointed to examine into their conduct were resolved\nto have them do their duty or be punished for the omission, they were\nmore exact, and the people were strictly restrained; which was a thing\nthey took so ill and bore so impatiently that their discontents can\nhardly be described. But there was an absolute necessity for it, that\nmust be confessed, unless some other measures had been timely entered\nupon, and it was too late for that.\n\nHad not this particular (of the sick being restrained as above) been our\ncase at that time, London would have been the most dreadful place that\never was in the world; there would, for aught I know, have as many\npeople died in the streets as died in their houses; for when the\ndistemper was at its height it generally made them raving and delirious,\nand when they were so they would never be persuaded to keep in their\nbeds but by force; and many who were not tied threw themselves out of\nwindows when they found they could not get leave to go out of their\ndoors.\n\nIt was for want of people conversing one with another, in this time of\ncalamity, that it was impossible any particular person could come at the\nknowledge of all the extraordinary cases that occurred in different\nfamilies; and particularly I believe it was never known to this day how\nmany people in their deliriums drowned themselves in the Thames, and in\nthe river which runs from the marshes by Hackney, which we generally\ncalled Ware River, or Hackney River. As to those which were set down in\nthe weekly bill, they were indeed few; nor could it be known of any of\nthose whether they drowned themselves by accident or not. But I believe\nI might reckon up more who within the compass of my knowledge or\nobservation really drowned themselves in that year, than are put down in\nthe bill of all put together: for many of the bodies were never found\nwho yet were known to be lost; and the like in other methods of self-\ndestruction. There was also one man in or about Whitecross Street burned\nhimself to death in his bed; some said it was done by himself, others\nthat it was by the treachery of the nurse that attended him; but that he\nhad the plague upon him was agreed by all.\n\nIt was a merciful disposition of Providence also, and which I have many\ntimes thought of at that time, that no fires, or no considerable ones at\nleast, happened in the city during that year, which, if it had been\notherwise, would have been very dreadful; and either the people must\nhave let them alone unquenched, or have come together in great crowds\nand throngs, unconcerned at the danger of the infection, not concerned\nat the houses they went into, at the goods they handled, or at the\npersons or the people they came among. But so it was, that excepting\nthat in Cripplegate parish, and two or three little eruptions of fires,\nwhich were presently extinguished, there was no disaster of that kind\nhappened in the whole year. They told us a story of a house in a place\ncalled Swan Alley, passing from Goswell Street, near the end of Old\nStreet, into St John Street, that a family was infected there in so\nterrible a manner that every one of the house died. The last person lay\ndead on the floor, and, as it is supposed, had lain herself all along to\ndie just before the fire; the fire, it seems, had fallen from its place,\nbeing of wood, and had taken hold of the boards and the joists they lay\non, and burnt as far as just to the body, but had not taken hold of the\ndead body (though she had little more than her shift on) and had gone\nout of itself, not burning the rest of the house, though it was a slight\ntimber house. How true this might be I do not determine, but the city\nbeing to suffer severely the next year by fire, this year it felt very\nlittle of that calamity.\n\nIndeed, considering the deliriums which the agony threw people into, and\nhow I have mentioned in their madness, when they were alone, they did\nmany desperate things, it was very strange there were no more disasters\nof that kind.\n\nIt has been frequently asked me, and I cannot say that I ever knew how\nto give a direct answer to it, how it came to pass that so many infected\npeople appeared abroad in the streets at the same time that the houses\nwhich were infected were so vigilantly searched, and all of them shut up\nand guarded as they were.\n\nI confess I know not what answer to give to this, unless it be this:\nthat in so great and populous a city as this is it was impossible to\ndiscover every house that was infected as soon as it was so, or to shut\nup all the houses that were infected; so that people had the liberty of\ngoing about the streets, even where they Pleased, unless they were known\nto belong to such-and-such infected houses.\n\nIt is true that, as several physicians told my Lord Mayor, the fury of\nthe contagion was such at some particular times, and people sickened so\nfast and died so soon, that it was impossible, and indeed to no purpose,\nto go about to inquire who was sick and who was well, or to shut them up\nwith such exactness as the thing required, almost every house in a whole\nstreet being infected, and in many places every person in some of the\nhouses; and that which was still worse, by the time that the houses were\nknown to be infected, most of the persons infected would be stone dead,\nand the rest run away for fear of being shut up; so that it was to very\nsmall purpose to call them infected houses and shut them up, the\ninfection having ravaged and taken its leave of the house before it was\nreally known that the family was any way touched.\n\nThis might be sufficient to convince any reasonable person that as it\nwas not in the power of the magistrates or of any human methods of\npolicy, to prevent the spreading the infection, so that this way of\nshutting up of houses was perfectly insufficient for that end. Indeed it\nseemed to have no manner of public good in it, equal or proportionable\nto the grievous burden that it was to the particular families that were\nso shut up; and, as far as I was employed by the public in directing\nthat severity, I frequently found occasion to see that it was incapable\nof answering the end. For example, as I was desired, as a visitor or\nexaminer, to inquire into the particulars of several families which were\ninfected, we scarce came to any house where the plague had visibly\nappeared in the family but that some of the family were fled and gone.\nThe magistrates would resent this, and charge the examiners with being\nremiss in their examination or inspection. But by that means houses were\nlong infected before it was known. Now, as I was in this dangerous\noffice but half the appointed time, which was two months, it was long\nenough to inform myself that we were no way capable of coming at the\nknowledge of the true state of any family but by inquiring at the door\nor of the neighbours. As for going into every house to search, that was\na part no authority would offer to impose on the inhabitants, or any\ncitizen would undertake: for it would have been exposing us to certain\ninfection and death, and to the ruin of our own families as well as of\nourselves; nor would any citizen of probity, and that could be depended\nupon, have stayed in the town if they had been made liable to such a\nseverity.\n\nSeeing then that we could come at the certainty of things by no method\nbut that of inquiry of the neighbours or of the family, and on that we\ncould not justly depend, it was not possible but that the uncertainty of\nthis matter would remain as above.\n\nIt is true masters of families were bound by the order to give notice to\nthe examiner of the place wherein he lived, within two hours after he\nshould discover it, of any person being sick in his house (that is to\nsay, having signs of the infection)--but they found so many ways to\nevade this and excuse their negligence that they seldom gave that notice\ntill they had taken measures to have every one escape out of the house\nwho had a mind to escape, whether they were sick or sound; and while\nthis was so, it is easy to see that the shutting up of houses was no way\nto be depended upon as a sufficient method for putting a stop to the\ninfection because, as I have said elsewhere, many of those that so went\nout of those infected houses had the plague really upon them, though\nthey might really think themselves sound. And some of these were the\npeople that walked the streets till they fell down dead, not that they\nwere suddenly struck with the distemper as with a bullet that killed\nwith the stroke, but that they really had the infection in their blood\nlong before; only, that as it preyed secretly on the vitals, it appeared\nnot till it seized the heart with a mortal power, and the patient died\nin a moment, as with a sudden fainting or an apoplectic fit.\n\nI know that some even of our physicians thought for a time that those\npeople that so died in the streets were seized but that moment they\nfell, as if they had been touched by a stroke from heaven as men are\nkilled by a flash of lightning--but they found reason to alter their\nopinion afterward; for upon examining the bodies of such after they were\ndead, they always either had tokens upon them or other evident proofs of\nthe distemper having been longer upon them than they had otherwise\nexpected.\n\nThis often was the reason that, as I have said, we that were examiners\nwere not able to come at the knowledge of the infection being entered\ninto a house till it was too late to shut it up, and sometimes not till\nthe people that were left were all dead. In Petticoat Lane two houses\ntogether were infected, and several people sick; but the distemper was\nso well concealed, the examiner, who was my neighbour, got no knowledge\nof it till notice was sent him that the people were all dead, and that\nthe carts should call there to fetch them away. The two heads of the\nfamilies concerted their measures, and so ordered their matters as that\nwhen the examiner was in the neighbourhood they appeared generally at a\ntime, and answered, that is, lied, for one another, or got some of the\nneighbourhood to say they were all in health--and perhaps knew no\nbetter--till, death making it impossible to keep it any longer as a\nsecret, the dead-carts were called in the night to both the houses, and\nso it became public. But when the examiner ordered the constable to shut\nup the houses there was nobody left in them but three people, two in one\nhouse and one in the other, just dying, and a nurse in each house who\nacknowledged that they had buried five before, that the houses had been\ninfected nine or ten days, and that for all the rest of the two\nfamilies, which were many, they were gone, some sick, some well, or\nwhether sick or well could not be known.\n\nIn like manner, at another house in the same lane, a man having his\nfamily infected but very unwilling to be shut up, when he could conceal\nit no longer, shut up himself; that is to say, he set the great red\ncross upon his door with the words, 'Lord have mercy upon us', and so\ndeluded the examiner, who supposed it had been done by the constable by\norder of the other examiner, for there were two examiners to every\ndistrict or precinct. By this means he had free egress and regress into\nhis house again and out of it, as he pleased, notwithstanding it was\ninfected, till at length his stratagem was found out; and then he, with\nthe sound part of his servants and family, made off and escaped, so they\nwere not shut up at all.\n\nThese things made it very hard, if not impossible, as I have said, to\nprevent the spreading of an infection by the shutting up of houses--\nunless the people would think the shutting of their houses no grievance,\nand be so willing to have it done as that they would give notice duly\nand faithfully to the magistrates of their being infected as soon as it\nwas known by themselves; but as that cannot be expected from them, and\nthe examiners cannot be supposed, as above, to go into their houses to\nvisit and search, all the good of shutting up houses will be defeated,\nand few houses will be shut up in time, except those of the poor, who\ncannot conceal it, and of some people who will be discovered by the\nterror and consternation which the things put them into.\n\nI got myself discharged of the dangerous office I was in as soon as I\ncould get another admitted, whom I had obtained for a little money to\naccept of it; and so, instead of serving the two months, which was\ndirected, I was not above three weeks in it; and a great while too,\nconsidering it was in the month of August, at which time the distemper\nbegan to rage with great violence at our end of the town.\n\nIn the execution of this office I could not refrain speaking my opinion\namong my neighbours as to this shutting up the people in their houses;\nin which we saw most evidently the severities that were used, though\ngrievous in themselves, had also this particular objection against them:\nnamely, that they did not answer the end, as I have said, but that the\ndistempered people went day by day about the streets; and it was our\nunited opinion that a method to have removed the sound from the sick, in\ncase of a particular house being visited, would have been much more\nreasonable on many accounts, leaving nobody with the sick persons but\nsuch as should on such occasion request to stay and declare themselves\ncontent to be shut up with them.\n\nOur scheme for removing those that were sound from those that were sick\nwas only in such houses as were infected, and confining the sick was no\nconfinement; those that could not stir would not complain while they\nwere in their senses and while they had the power of judging. Indeed,\nwhen they came to be delirious and light-headed, then they would cry out\nof the cruelty of being confined; but for the removal of those that were\nwell, we thought it highly reasonable and just, for their own sakes,\nthey should be removed from the sick, and that for other people's safety\nthey should keep retired for a while, to see that they were sound, and\nmight not infect others; and we thought twenty or thirty days enough for\nthis.\n\nNow, certainly, if houses had been provided on purpose for those that\nwere sound to perform this demi-quarantine in, they would have much less\nreason to think themselves injured in such a restraint than in being\nconfined with infected people in the houses where they lived.\n\nIt is here, however, to be observed that after the funerals became so\nmany that people could not toll the bell, mourn or weep, or wear black\nfor one another, as they did before; no, nor so much as make coffins for\nthose that died; so after a while the fury of the infection appeared to\nbe so increased that, in short, they shut up no houses at all. It seemed\nenough that all the remedies of that kind had been used till they were\nfound fruitless, and that the plague spread itself with an irresistible\nfury; so that as the fire the succeeding year spread itself, and burned\nwith such violence that the citizens, in despair, gave over their\nendeavours to extinguish it, so in the plague it came at last to such\nviolence that the people sat still looking at one another, and seemed\nquite abandoned to despair; whole streets seemed to be desolated, and\nnot to be shut up only, but to be emptied of their inhabitants; doors\nwere left open, windows stood shattering with the wind in empty houses\nfor want of people to shut them. In a word, people began to give up\nthemselves to their fears and to think that all regulations and methods\nwere in vain, and that there was nothing to be hoped for but an\nuniversal desolation; and it was even in the height of this general\ndespair that it Pleased God to stay His hand, and to slacken the fury of\nthe contagion in such a manner as was even surprising, like its\nbeginning, and demonstrated it to be His own particular hand, and that\nabove, if not without the agency of means, as I shall take notice of in\nits proper place.\n\nBut I must still speak of the plague as in its height, raging even to\ndesolation, and the people under the most dreadful consternation, even,\nas I have said, to despair. It is hardly credible to what excess the\npassions of men carried them in this extremity of the distemper, and\nthis part, I think, was as moving as the rest. What could affect a man\nin his full power of reflection, and what could make deeper impressions\non the soul, than to see a man almost naked, and got out of his house,\nor perhaps out of his bed, into the street, come out of Harrow Alley, a\npopulous conjunction or collection of alleys, courts, and passages in\nthe Butcher Row in Whitechappel,--I say, what could be more affecting\nthan to see this poor man come out into the open street, run dancing and\nsinging and making a thousand antic gestures, with five or six women and\nchildren running after him, crying and calling upon him for the Lord's\nsake to come back, and entreating the help of others to bring him back,\nbut all in vain, nobody daring to lay a hand upon him or to come near\nhim?\n\nThis was a most grievous and afflicting thing to me, who saw it all from\nmy own windows; for all this while the poor afflicted man was, as I\nobserved it, even then in the utmost agony of pain, having (as they\nsaid) two swellings upon him which could not be brought to break or to\nsuppurate; but, by laying strong caustics on them, the surgeons had, it\nseems, hopes to break them--which caustics were then upon him, burning\nhis flesh as with a hot iron. I cannot say what became of this poor man,\nbut I think he continued roving about in that manner till he fell down\nand died.\n\nNo wonder the aspect of the city itself was frightful. The usual\nconcourse of people in the streets, and which used to be supplied from\nour end of the town, was abated. The Exchange was not kept shut, indeed,\nbut it was no more frequented. The fires were lost; they had been almost\nextinguished for some days by a very smart and hasty rain. But that was\nnot all; some of the physicians insisted that they were not only no\nbenefit, but injurious to the health of people. This they made a loud\nclamour about, and complained to the Lord Mayor about it. On the other\nhand, others of the same faculty, and eminent too, opposed them, and\ngave their reasons why the fires were, and must be, useful to assuage\nthe violence of the distemper. I cannot give a full account of their\narguments on both sides; only this I remember, that they cavilled very\nmuch with one another. Some were for fires, but that they must be made\nof wood and not coal, and of particular sorts of wood too, such as fir\nin particular, or cedar, because of the strong effluvia of turpentine;\nothers were for coal and not wood, because of the sulphur and bitumen;\nand others were for neither one or other. Upon the whole, the Lord Mayor\nordered no more fires, and especially on this account, namely, that the\nplague was so fierce that they saw evidently it defied all means, and\nrather seemed to increase than decrease upon any application to check\nand abate it; and yet this amazement of the magistrates proceeded rather\nfrom want of being able to apply any means successfully than from any\nunwillingness either to expose themselves or undertake the care and\nweight of business; for, to do them justice, they neither spared their\npains nor their persons. But nothing answered; the infection raged, and\nthe people were now frighted and terrified to the last degree: so that,\nas I may say, they gave themselves up, and, as I mentioned above,\nabandoned themselves to their despair.\n\nBut let me observe here that, when I say the people abandoned themselves\nto despair, I do not mean to what men call a religious despair, or a\ndespair of their eternal state, but I mean a despair of their being able\nto escape the infection or to outlive the plague which they saw was so\nraging and so irresistible in its force that indeed few people that were\ntouched with it in its height, about August and September, escaped; and,\nwhich is very particular, contrary to its ordinary operation in June and\nJuly, and the beginning of August, when, as I have observed, many were\ninfected, and continued so many days, and then went off after having had\nthe poison in their blood a long time; but now, on the contrary, most of\nthe people who were taken during the two last weeks in August and in the\nthree first weeks in September, generally died in two or three days at\nfurthest, and many the very same day they were taken; whether the dog-\ndays, or, as our astrologers pretended to express themselves, the\ninfluence of the dog-star, had that malignant effect, or all those who\nhad the seeds of infection before in them brought it up to a maturity at\nthat time altogether, I know not; but this was the time when it was\nreported that above 3000 people died in one night; and they that would\nhave us believe they more critically observed it pretend to say that\nthey all died within the space of two hours, viz., between the hours of\none and three in the morning.\n\nAs to the suddenness of people's dying at this time, more than before,\nthere were innumerable instances of it, and I could name several in my\nneighbourhood. One family without the Bars, and not far from me, were\nall seemingly well on the Monday, being ten in family. That evening one\nmaid and one apprentice were taken ill and died the next morning--when\nthe other apprentice and two children were touched, whereof one died the\nsame evening, and the other two on Wednesday. In a word, by Saturday at\nnoon the master, mistress, four children, and four servants were all\ngone, and the house left entirely empty, except an ancient woman who\ncame in to take charge of the goods for the master of the family's\nbrother, who lived not far off, and who had not been sick.\n\nMany houses were then left desolate, all the people being carried away\ndead, and especially in an alley farther on the same side beyond the\nBars, going in at the sign of Moses and Aaron, there were several houses\ntogether which, they said, had not one person left alive in them; and\nsome that died last in several of those houses were left a little too\nlong before they were fetched out to be buried; the reason of which was\nnot, as some have written very untruly, that the living were not\nsufficient to bury the dead, but that the mortality was so great in the\nyard or alley that there was nobody left to give notice to the buriers\nor sextons that there were any dead bodies there to be buried. It was\nsaid, how true I know not, that some of those bodies were so much\ncorrupted and so rotten that it was with difficulty they were carried;\nand as the carts could not come any nearer than to the Alley Gate in the\nHigh Street, it was so much the more difficult to bring them along; but\nI am not certain how many bodies were then left. I am sure that\nordinarily it was not so.\n\nAs I have mentioned how the people were brought into a condition to\ndespair of life and abandon themselves, so this very thing had a strange\neffect among us for three or four weeks; that is, it made them bold and\nventurous: they were no more shy of one another, or restrained within\ndoors, but went anywhere and everywhere, and began to converse. One\nwould say to another, 'I do not ask you how you are, or say how I am; it\nis certain we shall all go; so 'tis no matter who is all sick or who is\nsound'; and so they ran desperately into any place or any company.\n\nAs it brought the people into public company, so it was surprising how\nit brought them to crowd into the churches. They inquired no more into\nwhom they sat near to or far from, what offensive smells they met with,\nor what condition the people seemed to be in; but, looking upon\nthemselves all as so many dead corpses, they came to the churches\nwithout the least caution, and crowded together as if their lives were\nof no consequence compared to the work which they came about there.\nIndeed, the zeal which they showed in coming, and the earnestness and\naffection they showed in their attention to what they heard, made it\nmanifest what a value people would all put upon the worship of God if\nthey thought every day they attended at the church that it would be\ntheir last.\n\nNor was it without other strange effects, for it took away, all manner\nof prejudice at or scruple about the person whom they found in the\npulpit when they came to the churches. It cannot be doubted but that\nmany of the ministers of the parish churches were cut off, among others,\nin so common and dreadful a calamity; and others had not courage enough\nto stand it, but removed into the country as they found means for\nescape. As then some parish churches were quite vacant and forsaken, the\npeople made no scruple of desiring such Dissenters as had been a few\nyears before deprived of their livings by virtue of the Act of\nParliament called the Act of Uniformity to preach in the churches; nor\ndid the church ministers in that case make any difficulty of accepting\ntheir assistance; so that many of those whom they called silenced\nministers had their mouths opened on this occasion and preached publicly\nto the people.\n\nHere we may observe and I hope it will not be amiss to take notice of it\nthat a near view of death would soon reconcile men of good principles\none to another, and that it is chiefly owing to our easy situation in\nlife and our putting these things far from us that our breaches are\nfomented, ill blood continued, prejudices, breach of charity and of\nChristian union, so much kept and so far carried on among us as it is.\nAnother plague year would reconcile all these differences; a close\nconversing with death, or with diseases that threaten death, would scum\noff the gall from our tempers, remove the animosities among us, and\nbring us to see with differing eyes than those which we looked on things\nwith before. As the people who had been used to join with the Church\nwere reconciled at this time with the admitting the Dissenters to preach\nto them, so the Dissenters, who with an uncommon prejudice had broken\noff from the communion of the Church of England, were now content to\ncome to their parish churches and to conform to the worship which they\ndid not approve of before; but as the terror of the infection abated,\nthose things all returned again to their less desirable channel and to\nthe course they were in before.\n\nI mention this but historically. I have no mind to enter into arguments\nto move either or both sides to a more charitable compliance one with\nanother. I do not see that it is probable such a discourse would be\neither suitable or successful; the breaches seem rather to widen, and\ntend to a widening further, than to closing, and who am I that I should\nthink myself able to influence either one side or other? But this I may\nrepeat again, that 'tis evident death will reconcile us all; on the\nother side the grave we shall be all brethren again. In heaven, whither\nI hope we may come from all parties and persuasions, we shall find\nneither prejudice or scruple; there we shall be of one principle and of\none opinion. Why we cannot be content to go hand in hand to the Place\nwhere we shall join heart and hand without the least hesitation, and\nwith the most complete harmony and affection--I say, why we cannot do so\nhere I can say nothing to, neither shall I say anything more of it but\nthat it remains to be lamented.\n\nI could dwell a great while upon the calamities of this dreadful time,\nand go on to describe the objects that appeared among us every day, the\ndreadful extravagancies which the distraction of sick people drove them\ninto; how the streets began now to be fuller of frightful objects, and\nfamilies to be made even a terror to themselves. But after I have told\nyou, as I have above, that one man, being tied in his bed, and finding\nno other way to deliver himself, set the bed on fire with his candle,\nwhich unhappily stood within his reach, and burnt himself in his bed;\nand how another, by the insufferable torment he bore, danced and sung\nnaked in the streets, not knowing one ecstasy from another; I say, after\nI have mentioned these things, what can be added more? What can be said\nto represent the misery of these times more lively to the reader, or to\ngive him a more perfect idea of a complicated distress?\n\nI must acknowledge that this time was terrible, that I was sometimes at\nthe end of all my resolutions, and that I had not the courage that I had\nat the beginning. As the extremity brought other people abroad, it drove\nme home, and except having made my voyage down to Blackwall and\nGreenwich, as I have related, which was an excursion, I kept afterwards\nvery much within doors, as I had for about a fortnight before. I have\nsaid already that I repented several times that I had ventured to stay\nin town, and had not gone away with my brother and his family, but it\nwas too late for that now; and after I had retreated and stayed within\ndoors a good while before my impatience led me abroad, then they called\nme, as I have said, to an ugly and dangerous office which brought me out\nagain; but as that was expired while the height of the distemper lasted,\nI retired again, and continued close ten or twelve days more, during\nwhich many dismal spectacles represented themselves in my view out of my\nown windows and in our own street--as that particularly from Harrow\nAlley, of the poor outrageous creature which danced and sung in his\nagony; and many others there were. Scarce a day or night passed over but\nsome dismal thing or other happened at the end of that Harrow Alley,\nwhich was a place full of poor people, most of them belonging to the\nbutchers or to employments depending upon the butchery.\n\nSometimes heaps and throngs of people would burst out of the alley, most\nof them women, making a dreadful clamour, mixed or compounded of\nscreeches, cryings, and calling one another, that we could not conceive\nwhat to make of it. Almost all the dead part of the night the dead-cart\nstood at the end of that alley, for if it went in it could not well turn\nagain, and could go in but a little way. There, I say, it stood to\nreceive dead bodies, and as the churchyard was but a little way off, if\nit went away full it would soon be back again. It is impossible to\ndescribe the most horrible cries and noise the poor people would make at\ntheir bringing the dead bodies of their children and friends out of the\ncart, and by the number one would have thought there had been none left\nbehind, or that there were people enough for a small city living in\nthose places. Several times they cried 'Murder', sometimes 'Fire'; but\nit was easy to perceive it was all distraction, and the complaints of\ndistressed and distempered people.\n\nI believe it was everywhere thus as that time, for the plague raged for\nsix or seven weeks beyond all that I have expressed, and came even to\nsuch a height that, in the extremity, they began to break into that\nexcellent order of which I have spoken so much in behalf of the\nmagistrates; namely, that no dead bodies were seen in the street or\nburials in the daytime: for there was a necessity in this extremity to\nbear with its being otherwise for a little while.\n\nOne thing I cannot omit here, and indeed I thought it was extraordinary,\nat least it seemed a remarkable hand of Divine justice: viz., that all\nthe predictors, astrologers, fortune-tellers, and what they called\ncunning-men, conjurers, and the like: calculators of nativities and\ndreamers of dream, and such people, were gone and vanished; not one of\nthem was to be found. I am verily persuaded that a great number of them\nfell in the heat of the calamity, having ventured to stay upon the\nprospect of getting great estates; and indeed their gain was but too\ngreat for a time, through the madness and folly of the people. But now\nthey were silent; many of them went to their long home, not able to\nforetell their own fate or to calculate their own nativities. Some have\nbeen critical enough to say that every one of them died. I dare not\naffirm that; but this I must own, that I never heard of one of them that\never appeared after the calamity was over.\n\nBut to return to my particular observations during this dreadful part of\nthe visitation. I am now come, as I have said, to the month of\nSeptember, which was the most dreadful of its kind, I believe, that ever\nLondon saw; for, by all the accounts which I have seen of the preceding\nvisitations which have been in London, nothing has been like it, the\nnumber in the weekly bill amounting to almost 40,000 from the 22nd of\nAugust to the 26th of September, being but five weeks. The particulars\nof the bills are as follows, viz.:--\n\n\n     From August the   22nd to the 29th             7496\n     \"     \"           29th     \"    5th September  8252\n     \"    September the 5th     \"   12th            7690\n     \"     \"           12th     \"   19th            8297\n     \"     \"           19th     \"   26th            6460\n     -                                             -----\n     -                                            38,195\n\nThis was a prodigious number of itself, but if I should add the reasons\nwhich I have to believe that this account was deficient, and how\ndeficient it was, you would, with me, make no scruple to believe that\nthere died above ten thousand a week for all those weeks, one week with\nanother, and a proportion for several weeks both before and after. The\nconfusion among the people, especially within the city, at that time,\nwas inexpressible. The terror was so great at last that the courage of\nthe people appointed to carry away the dead began to fail them; nay,\nseveral of them died, although they had the distemper before and were\nrecovered, and some of them dropped down when they have been carrying\nthe bodies even at the pit side, and just ready to throw them in; and\nthis confusion was greater in the city because they had flattered\nthemselves with hopes of escaping, and thought the bitterness of death\nwas past. One cart, they told us, going up Shoreditch was forsaken of\nthe drivers, or being left to one man to drive, he died in the street;\nand the horses going on overthrew the cart, and left the bodies, some\nthrown out here, some there, in a dismal manner. Another cart was, it\nseems, found in the great pit in Finsbury Fields, the driver being dead,\nor having been gone and abandoned it, and the horses running too near\nit, the cart fell in and drew the horses in also. It was suggested that\nthe driver was thrown in with it and that the cart fell upon him, by\nreason his whip was seen to be in the pit among the bodies; but that, I\nsuppose, could not be certain.\n\nIn our parish of Aldgate the dead-carts were several times, as I have\nheard, found standing at the churchyard gate full of dead bodies, but\nneither bellman or driver or any one else with it; neither in these or\nmany other cases did they know what bodies they had in their cart, for\nsometimes they were let down with ropes out of balconies and out of\nwindows, and sometimes the bearers brought them to the cart, sometimes\nother people; nor, as the men themselves said, did they trouble\nthemselves to keep any account of the numbers.\n\nThe vigilance of the magistrates was now put to the utmost trial--and,\nit must be confessed, can never be enough acknowledged on this occasion\nalso; whatever expense or trouble they were at, two things were never\nneglected in the city or suburbs either:--\n\n(1) Provisions were always to be had in full plenty, and the price not\nmuch raised neither, hardly worth speaking.\n\n(2) No dead bodies lay unburied or uncovered; and if one walked from one\nend of the city to another, no funeral or sign of it was to be seen in\nthe daytime, except a little, as I have said above, in the three first\nweeks in September.\n\nThis last article perhaps will hardly be believed when some accounts\nwhich others have published since that shall be seen, wherein they say\nthat the dead lay unburied, which I am assured was utterly false; at\nleast, if it had been anywhere so, it must have been in houses where the\nliving were gone from the dead (having found means, as I have observed,\nto escape) and where no notice was given to the officers. All which\namounts to nothing at all in the case in hand; for this I am positive\nin, having myself been employed a little in the direction of that part\nin the parish in which I lived, and where as great a desolation was made\nin proportion to the number of inhabitants as was anywhere; I say, I am\nsure that there were no dead bodies remained unburied; that is to say,\nnone that the proper officers knew of; none for want of people to carry\nthem off, and buriers to put them into the ground and cover them; and\nthis is sufficient to the argument; for what might lie in houses and\nholes, as in Moses and Aaron Alley, is nothing; for it is most certain\nthey were buried as soon as they were found. As to the first article\n(namely, of provisions, the scarcity or dearness), though I have\nmentioned it before and shall speak of it again, yet I must observe\nhere:--\n\n(1) The price of bread in particular was not much raised; for in the\nbeginning of the year, viz., in the first week in March, the penny\nwheaten loaf was ten ounces and a half; and in the height of the\ncontagion it was to be had at nine ounces and a half, and never dearer,\nno, not all that season. And about the beginning of November it was sold\nten ounces and a half again; the like of which, I believe, was never\nheard of in any city, under so dreadful a visitation, before.\n\n(2) Neither was there (which I wondered much at) any want of bakers or\novens kept open to supply the people with the bread; but this was indeed\nalleged by some families, viz., that their maidservants, going to the\nbakehouses with their dough to be baked, which was then the custom,\nsometimes came home with the sickness (that is to say the plague) upon\nthem.\n\nIn all this dreadful visitation there were, as I have said before, but\ntwo pest-houses made use of, viz., one in the fields beyond Old Street\nand one in Westminster; neither was there any compulsion used in\ncarrying people thither. Indeed there was no need of compulsion in the\ncase, for there were thousands of poor distressed people who, having no\nhelp or conveniences or supplies but of charity, would have been very\nglad to have been carried thither and been taken care of; which, indeed,\nwas the only thing that I think was wanting in the whole public\nmanagement of the city, seeing nobody was here allowed to be brought to\nthe pest-house but where money was given, or security for money, either\nat their introducing or upon their being cured and sent out--for very\nmany were sent out again whole; and very good physicians were appointed\nto those places, so that many people did very well there, of which I\nshall make mention again. The principal sort of people sent thither\nwere, as I have said, servants who got the distemper by going on errands\nto fetch necessaries to the families where they lived, and who in that\ncase, if they came home sick, were removed to preserve the rest of the\nhouse; and they were so well looked after there in all the time of the\nvisitation that there was but 156 buried in all at the London pest-\nhouse, and 159 at that of Westminster.\n\nBy having more pest-houses I am far from meaning a forcing all people\ninto such places. Had the shutting up of houses been omitted and the\nsick hurried out of their dwellings to pest-houses, as some proposed, it\nseems, at that time as well as since, it would certainly have been much\nworse than it was. The very removing the sick would have been a\nspreading of the infection, and rather because that removing could not\neffectually clear the house where the sick person was of the distemper;\nand the rest of the family, being then left at liberty, would certainly\nspread it among others.\n\nThe methods also in private families, which would have been universally\nused to have concealed the distemper and to have concealed the persons\nbeing sick, would have been such that the distemper would sometimes have\nseized a whole family before any visitors or examiners could have known\nof it. On the other hand, the prodigious numbers which would have been\nsick at a time would have exceeded all the capacity of public pest-\nhouses to receive them, or of public officers to discover and remove\nthem.\n\nThis was well considered in those days, and I have heard them talk of it\noften. The magistrates had enough to do to bring people to submit to\nhaving their houses shut up, and many ways they deceived the watchmen\nand got out, as I have observed. But that difficulty made it apparent\nthat they would have found it impracticable to have gone the other way\nto work, for they could never have forced the sick people out of their\nbeds and out of their dwellings. It must not have been my Lord Mayor's\nofficers, but an army of officers, that must have attempted it; and the\npeople, on the other hand, would have been enraged and desperate, and\nwould have killed those that should have offered to have meddled with\nthem or with their children and relations, whatever had befallen them\nfor it; so that they would have made the people, who, as it was, were in\nthe most terrible distraction imaginable, I say, they would have made\nthem stark mad; whereas the magistrates found it proper on several\naccounts to treat them with lenity and compassion, and not with violence\nand terror, such as dragging the sick out of their houses or obliging\nthem to remove themselves, would have been.\n\nThis leads me again to mention the time when the plague first began;\nthat is to say, when it became certain that it would spread over the\nwhole town, when, as I have said, the better sort of people first took\nthe alarm and began to hurry themselves out of town. It was true, as I\nobserved in its place, that the throng was so great, and the coaches,\nhorses, waggons, and carts were so many, driving and dragging the people\naway, that it looked as if all the city was running away; and had any\nregulations been published that had been terrifying at that time,\nespecially such as would pretend to dispose of the people otherwise than\nthey would dispose of themselves, it would have put both the city and\nsuburbs into the utmost confusion.\n\nBut the magistrates wisely caused the people to be encouraged, made very\ngood bye-laws for the regulating the citizens, keeping good order in the\nstreets, and making everything as eligible as possible to all sorts of\npeople.\n\nIn the first place, the Lord Mayor and the sheriffs, the Court of\nAldermen, and a certain number of the Common Council men, or their\ndeputies, came to a resolution and published it, viz., that they would\nnot quit the city themselves, but that they would be always at hand for\nthe preserving good order in every place and for the doing justice on\nall occasions; as also for the distributing the public charity to the\npoor; and, in a word, for the doing the duty and discharging the trust\nreposed in them by the citizens to the utmost of their power.\n\nIn pursuance of these orders, the Lord Mayor, sheriffs, &c., held\ncouncils every day, more or less, for making such dispositions as they\nfound needful for preserving the civil peace; and though they used the\npeople with all possible gentleness and clemency, yet all manner of\npresumptuous rogues such as thieves, housebreakers, plunderers of the\ndead or of the sick, were duly punished, and several declarations were\ncontinually published by the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen against\nsuch.\n\nAlso all constables and churchwardens were enjoined to stay in the city\nupon severe penalties, or to depute such able and sufficient\nhousekeepers as the deputy aldermen or Common Council men of the\nprecinct should approve, and for whom they should give security; and\nalso security in case of mortality that they would forthwith constitute\nother constables in their stead.\n\nThese things re-established the minds of the people very much,\nespecially in the first of their fright, when they talked of making so\nuniversal a flight that the city would have been in danger of being\nentirely deserted of its inhabitants except the poor, and the country of\nbeing plundered and laid waste by the multitude. Nor were the\nmagistrates deficient in performing their part as boldly as they\npromised it; for my Lord Mayor and the sheriffs were continually in the\nstreets and at places of the greatest danger, and though they did not\ncare for having too great a resort of people crowding about them, yet in\nemergent cases they never denied the people access to them, and heard\nwith patience all their grievances and complaints. My Lord Mayor had a\nlow gallery built on purpose in his hall, where he stood a little\nremoved from the crowd when any complaint came to be heard, that he\nmight appear with as much safety as possible.\n\nLikewise the proper officers, called my Lord Mayor's officers,\nconstantly attended in their turns, as they were in waiting; and if any\nof them were sick or infected, as some of them were, others were\ninstantly employed to fill up and officiate in their places till it was\nknown whether the other should live or die.\n\nIn like manner the sheriffs and aldermen did in their several stations\nand wards, where they were placed by office, and the sheriff's officers\nor sergeants were appointed to receive orders from the respective\naldermen in their turn, so that justice was executed in all cases\nwithout interruption. In the next place, it was one of their particular\ncares to see the orders for the freedom of the markets observed, and in\nthis part either the Lord Mayor or one or both of the sheriffs were\nevery market-day on horseback to see their orders executed and to see\nthat the country people had all possible encouragement and freedom in\ntheir coming to the markets and going back again, and that no nuisances\nor frightful objects should be seen in the streets to terrify them or\nmake them unwilling to come. Also the bakers were taken under particular\norder, and the Master of the Bakers' Company was, with his court of\nassistants, directed to see the order of my Lord Mayor for their\nregulation put in execution, and the due assize of bread (which was\nweekly appointed by my Lord Mayor) observed; and all the bakers were\nobliged to keep their oven going constantly, on pain of losing the\nprivileges of a freeman of the city of London.\n\nBy this means bread was always to be had in plenty, and as cheap as\nusual, as I said above; and provisions were never wanting in the\nmarkets, even to such a degree that I often wondered at it, and\nreproached myself with being so timorous and cautious in stirring\nabroad, when the country people came freely and boldly to market, as if\nthere had been no manner of infection in the city, or danger of catching\nit.\n\nIt was indeed one admirable piece of conduct in the said magistrates\nthat the streets were kept constantly clear and free from all manner of\nfrightful objects, dead bodies, or any such things as were indecent or\nunpleasant--unless where anybody fell down suddenly or died in the\nstreets, as I have said above; and these were generally covered with\nsome cloth or blanket, or removed into the next churchyard till night.\nAll the needful works that carried terror with them, that were both\ndismal and dangerous, were done in the night; if any diseased bodies\nwere removed, or dead bodies buried, or infected clothes burnt, it was\ndone in the night; and all the bodies which were thrown into the great\npits in the several churchyards or burying-grounds, as has been\nobserved, were so removed in the night, and everything was covered and\nclosed before day. So that in the daytime there was not the least signal\nof the calamity to be seen or heard of, except what was to be observed\nfrom the emptiness of the streets, and sometimes from the passionate\noutcries and lamentations of the people, out at their windows, and from\nthe numbers of houses and shops shut up.\n\nNor was the silence and emptiness of the streets so much in the city as\nin the out-parts, except just at one particular time when, as I have\nmentioned, the plague came east and spread over all the city. It was\nindeed a merciful disposition of God, that as the plague began at one\nend of the town first (as has been observed at large) so it proceeded\nprogressively to other parts, and did not come on this way, or eastward,\ntill it had spent its fury in the West part of the town; and so, as it\ncame on one way, it abated another. For example, it began at St Giles's\nand the Westminster end of the town, and it was in its height in all\nthat part by about the middle of July, viz., in St Giles-in-the-Fields,\nSt Andrew's, Holborn, St Clement Danes, St Martin-in-the-Fields, and in\nWestminster. The latter end of July it decreased in those parishes; and\ncoming east, it increased prodigiously in Cripplegate, St Sepulcher's,\nSt James's, Clarkenwell, and St Bride's and Aldersgate. While it was in\nall these parishes, the city and all the parishes of the Southwark side\nof the water and all Stepney, Whitechappel, Aldgate, Wapping, and\nRatcliff, were very little touched; so that people went about their\nbusiness unconcerned, carried on their trades, kept open their shops,\nand conversed freely with one another in all the city, the east and\nnorth-east suburbs, and in Southwark, almost as if the plague had not\nbeen among us.\n\nEven when the north and north-west suburbs were fully infected, viz.,\nCripplegate, Clarkenwell, Bishopsgate, and Shoreditch, yet still all the\nrest were tolerably well. For example from 25th July to 1st August the\nbill stood thus of all diseases:--\n\n\n     St Giles, Cripplegate                              554\n     St Sepulchers                                      250\n     Clarkenwell                                        103\n     Bishopsgate                                        116\n     Shoreditch                                         110\n     Stepney parish                                     127\n     Aldgate                                             92\n     Whitechappel                                       104\n     All the ninety-seven parishes within the walls     228\n     All the parishes in Southwark                      205\n     -                                                -----\n     -    Total                                        1889\n\nSo that, in short, there died more that week in the two parishes of\nCripplegate and St Sepulcher by forty-eight than in all the city, all\nthe east suburbs, and all the Southwark parishes put together. This\ncaused the reputation of the city's health to continue all over England-\n-and especially in the counties and markets adjacent, from whence our\nsupply of provisions chiefly came even much longer than that health\nitself continued; for when the people came into the streets from the\ncountry by Shoreditch and Bishopsgate, or by Old Street and Smithfield,\nthey would see the out-streets empty and the houses and shops shut, and\nthe few people that were stirring there walk in the middle of the\nstreets. But when they came within the city, there things looked better,\nand the markets and shops were open, and the people walking about the\nstreets as usual, though not quite so many; and this continued till the\nlatter end of August and the beginning of September.\n\nBut then the case altered quite; the distemper abated in the west and\nnorth-west parishes, and the weight of the infection lay on the city and\nthe eastern suburbs, and the Southwark side, and this in a frightful\nmanner. Then, indeed, the city began to look dismal, shops to be shut,\nand the streets desolate. In the High Street, indeed, necessity made\npeople stir abroad on many occasions; and there would be in the middle\nof the day a pretty many people, but in the mornings and evenings scarce\nany to be seen, even there, no, not in Cornhill and Cheapside.\n\nThese observations of mine were abundantly confirmed by the weekly bills\nof mortality for those weeks, an abstract of which, as they respect the\nparishes which. I have mentioned and as they make the calculations I\nspeak of very evident, take as follows.\n\nThe weekly bill, which makes out this decrease of the burials in the\nwest and north side of the city, stands thus--\n\n\n     From the 12th of September to the 19th--\n     -    St Giles, Cripplegate                            456\n     -    St Giles-in-the-Fields                           140\n     -    Clarkenwell                                       77\n     -    St Sepulcher                                     214\n     -    St Leonard, Shoreditch                           183\n     -    Stepney parish                                   716\n     -    Aldgate                                          623\n     -    Whitechappel                                     532\n     -    In the ninety-seven parishes within the walls   1493\n     -    In the eight parishes on Southwark side         1636\n     -                                                   -----\n     -         Total                                      6060\n\nHere is a strange change of things indeed, and a sad change it was; and\nhad it held for two months more than it did, very few people would have\nbeen left alive. But then such, I say, was the merciful disposition of\nGod that, when it was thus, the west and north part which had been so\ndreadfully visited at first, grew, as you see, much better; and as the\npeople disappeared here, they began to look abroad again there; and the\nnext week or two altered it still more; that is, more to the\nencouragement of the other part of the town. For example:--\n\n\n     From the 19th of September to the 26th--\n     -    St Giles, Cripplegate                           277\n     -    St Giles-in-the-Fields                          119\n     -    Clarkenwell                                      76\n     -    St Sepulchers                                   193\n     -    St Leonard, Shoreditch                          146\n     -    Stepney parish                                  616\n     -    Aldgate                                         496\n     -    Whitechappel                                    346\n     -    In the ninety-seven parishes within the walls  1268\n     -    In the eight parishes on Southwark side        1390\n     -                                                  -----\n     -              Total                                4927\n\n     From the 26th of September to the 3rd of October--\n     -    St Giles, Cripplegate                           196\n     -    St Giles-in-the-Fields                           95\n     -    Clarkenwell                                      48\n     -    St Sepulchers                                   137\n     -    St Leonard, Shoreditch                          128\n     -    Stepney parish                                  674\n     -    Aldgate                                         372\n     -    Whitechappel                                    328\n     -    In the ninety-seven parishes within the walls  1149\n     -    In the eight parishes on Southwark side        1201\n     -                                                  -----\n     -    Total                                          4382\n\nAnd now the misery of the city and of the said east and south parts was\ncomplete indeed; for, as you see, the weight of the distemper lay upon\nthose parts, that is to say, the city, the eight parishes over the\nriver, with the parishes of Aldgate, Whitechappel, and Stepney; and this\nwas the time that the bills came up to such a monstrous height as that I\nmentioned before, and that eight or nine, and, as I believe, ten or\ntwelve thousand a week, died; for it is my settled opinion that they\nnever could come at any just account of the numbers, for the reasons\nwhich I have given already.\n\nNay, one of the most eminent physicians, who has since published in\nLatin an account of those times, and of his observations says that in\none week there died twelve thousand people, and that particularly there\ndied four thousand in one night; though I do not remember that there\never was any such particular night so remarkably fatal as that such a\nnumber died in it. However, all this confirms what I have said above of\nthe uncertainty of the bills of mortality, &c., of which I shall say\nmore hereafter.\n\nAnd here let me take leave to enter again, though it may seem a\nrepetition of circumstances, into a description of the miserable\ncondition of the city itself, and of those parts where I lived at this\nparticular time. The city and those other parts, notwithstanding the\ngreat numbers of people that were gone into the country, was vastly full\nof people; and perhaps the fuller because people had for a long time a\nstrong belief that the plague would not come into the city, nor into\nSouthwark, no, nor into Wapping or Ratcliff at all; nay, such was the\nassurance of the people on that head that many removed from the suburbs\non the west and north sides, into those eastern and south sides as for\nsafety; and, as I verily believe, carried the plague amongst them there\nperhaps sooner than they would otherwise have had it.\n\nHere also I ought to leave a further remark for the use of posterity,\nconcerning the manner of people's infecting one another; namely, that it\nwas not the sick people only from whom the plague was immediately\nreceived by others that were sound, but the well. To explain myself: by\nthe sick people I mean those who were known to be sick, had taken their\nbeds, had been under cure, or had swellings and tumours upon them, and\nthe like; these everybody could beware of; they were either in their\nbeds or in such condition as could not be concealed.\n\nBy the well I mean such as had received the contagion, and had it really\nupon them, and in their blood, yet did not show the consequences of it\nin their countenances: nay, even were not sensible of it themselves, as\nmany were not for several days. These breathed death in every place, and\nupon everybody who came near them; nay, their very clothes retained the\ninfection, their hands would infect the things they touched, especially\nif they were warm and sweaty, and they were generally apt to sweat too.\n\nNow it was impossible to know these people, nor did they sometimes, as I\nhave said, know themselves to be infected. These were the people that so\noften dropped down and fainted in the streets; for oftentimes they would\ngo about the streets to the last, till on a sudden they would sweat,\ngrow faint, sit down at a door and die. It is true, finding themselves\nthus, they would struggle hard to get home to their own doors, or at\nother times would be just able to go into their houses and die\ninstantly; other times they would go about till they had the very tokens\ncome out upon them, and yet not know it, and would die in an hour or two\nafter they came home, but be well as long as they were abroad. These\nwere the dangerous people; these were the people of whom the well people\nought to have been afraid; but then, on the other side, it was\nimpossible to know them.\n\nAnd this is the reason why it is impossible in a visitation to prevent\nthe spreading of the plague by the utmost human vigilance: viz., that it\nis impossible to know the infected people from the sound, or that the\ninfected people should perfectly know themselves. I knew a man who\nconversed freely in London all the season of the plague in 1665, and\nkept about him an antidote or cordial on purpose to take when he thought\nhimself in any danger, and he had such a rule to know or have warning of\nthe danger by as indeed I never met with before or since. How far it may\nbe depended on I know not. He had a wound in his leg, and whenever he\ncame among any people that were not sound, and the infection began to\naffect him, he said he could know it by that signal, viz., that his\nwound in his leg would smart, and look pale and white; so as soon as\never he felt it smart it was time for him to withdraw, or to take care\nof himself, taking his drink, which he always carried about him for that\npurpose. Now it seems he found his wound would smart many times when he\nwas in company with such who thought themselves to be sound, and who\nappeared so to one another; but he would presently rise up and say\npublicly, 'Friends, here is somebody in the room that has the plague',\nand so would immediately break up the company. This was indeed a\nfaithful monitor to all people that the plague is not to be avoided by\nthose that converse promiscuously in a town infected, and people have it\nwhen they know it not, and that they likewise give it to others when\nthey know not that they have it themselves; and in this case shutting up\nthe well or removing the sick will not do it, unless they can go back\nand shut up all those that the sick had conversed with, even before they\nknew themselves to be sick, and none knows how far to carry that back,\nor where to stop; for none knows when or where or how they may have\nreceived the infection, or from whom.\n\nThis I take to be the reason which makes so many people talk of the air\nbeing corrupted and infected, and that they need not be cautious of whom\nthey converse with, for that the contagion was in the air. I have seen\nthem in strange agitations and surprises on this account. 'I have never\ncome near any infected body', says the disturbed person; 'I have\nconversed with none but sound, healthy people, and yet I have gotten the\ndistemper!' 'I am sure I am struck from Heaven', says another, and he\nfalls to the serious part. Again, the first goes on exclaiming, 'I have\ncome near no infection or any infected person; I am sure it is the air.\nWe draw in death when we breathe, and therefore 'tis the hand of God;\nthere is no withstanding it.' And this at last made many people, being\nhardened to the danger, grow less concerned at it; and less cautious\ntowards the latter end of the time, and when it was come to its height,\nthan they were at first. Then, with a kind of a Turkish\npredestinarianism, they would say, if it pleased God to strike them, it\nwas all one whether they went abroad or stayed at home; they could not\nescape it, and therefore they went boldly about, even into infected\nhouses and infected company; visited sick people; and, in short, lay in\nthe beds with their wives or relations when they were infected. And what\nwas the consequence, but the same that is the consequence in Turkey, and\nin those countries where they do those things--namely, that they were\ninfected too, and died by hundreds and thousands?\n\nI would be far from lessening the awe of the judgements of God and the\nreverence to His providence which ought always to be on our minds on\nsuch occasions as these. Doubtless the visitation itself is a stroke\nfrom Heaven upon a city, or country, or nation where it falls; a\nmessenger of His vengeance, and a loud call to that nation or country or\ncity to humiliation and repentance, according to that of the prophet\nJeremiah (xviii. 7, 8): 'At what instant I shall speak concerning a\nnation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to\ndestroy it; if that nation against whom I have pronounced turn from\ntheir evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.'\nNow to prompt due impressions of the awe of God on the minds of men on\nsuch occasions, and not to lessen them, it is that I have left those\nminutes upon record.\n\nI say, therefore, I reflect upon no man for putting the reason of those\nthings upon the immediate hand of God, and the appointment and direction\nof His providence; nay, on the contrary, there were many wonderful\ndeliverances of persons from infection, and deliverances of persons when\ninfected, which intimate singular and remarkable providence in the\nparticular instances to which they refer; and I esteem my own\ndeliverance to be one next to miraculous, and do record it with\nthankfulness.\n\nBut when I am speaking of the plague as a distemper arising from natural\ncauses, we must consider it as it was really propagated by natural\nmeans; nor is it at all the less a judgement for its being under the\nconduct of human causes and effects; for, as the Divine Power has formed\nthe whole scheme of nature and maintains nature in its course, so the\nsame Power thinks fit to let His own actings with men, whether of mercy\nor judgement, to go on in the ordinary course of natural causes; and He\nis pleased to act by those natural causes as the ordinary means,\nexcepting and reserving to Himself nevertheless a power to act in a\nsupernatural way when He sees occasion. Now 'tis evident that in the\ncase of an infection there is no apparent extraordinary occasion for\nsupernatural operation, but the ordinary course of things appears\nsufficiently armed, and made capable of all the effects that Heaven\nusually directs by a contagion. Among these causes and effects, this of\nthe secret conveyance of infection, imperceptible and unavoidable, is\nmore than sufficient to execute the fierceness of Divine vengeance,\nwithout putting it upon supernaturals and miracle.\n\nThe acute penetrating nature of the disease itself was such, and the\ninfection was received so imperceptibly, that the most exact caution\ncould not secure us while in the place. But I must be allowed to\nbelieve--and I have so many examples fresh in my memory to convince me\nof it, that I think none can resist their evidence--I say, I must be\nallowed to believe that no one in this whole nation ever received the\nsickness or infection but who received it in the ordinary way of\ninfection from somebody, or the clothes or touch or stench of somebody\nthat was infected before.\n\nThe manner of its coming first to London proves this also, viz., by\ngoods brought over from Holland, and brought thither from the Levant;\nthe first breaking of it out in a house in Long Acre where those goods\nwere carried and first opened; its spreading from that house to other\nhouses by the visible unwary conversing with those who were sick; and\nthe infecting the parish officers who were employed about the persons\ndead, and the like. These are known authorities for this great\nfoundation point--that it went on and proceeded from person to person\nand from house to house, and no otherwise. In the first house that was\ninfected there died four persons. A neighbour, hearing the mistress of\nthe first house was sick, went to visit her, and went home and gave the\ndistemper to her family, and died, and all her household. A minister,\ncalled to pray with the first sick person in the second house, was said\nto sicken immediately and die with several more in his house. Then the\nphysicians began to consider, for they did not at first dream of a\ngeneral contagion. But the physicians being sent to inspect the bodies,\nthey assured the people that it was neither more or less than the\nplague, with all its terrifying particulars, and that it threatened an\nuniversal infection, so many people having already conversed with the\nsick or distempered, and having, as might be supposed, received\ninfection from them, that it would be impossible to put a stop to it.\n\nHere the opinion of the physicians agreed with my observation\nafterwards, namely, that the danger was spreading insensibly, for the\nsick could infect none but those that came within reach of the sick\nperson; but that one man who may have really received the infection and\nknows it not, but goes abroad and about as a sound person, may give the\nplague to a thousand people, and they to greater numbers in proportion,\nand neither the person giving the infection or the persons receiving it\nknow anything of it, and perhaps not feel the effects of it for several\ndays after.\n\nFor example, many persons in the time of this visitation never perceived\nthat they were infected till they found to their unspeakable surprise,\nthe tokens come out upon them; after which they seldom lived six hours;\nfor those spots they called the tokens were really gangrene spots, or\nmortified flesh in small knobs as broad as a little silver penny, and\nhard as a piece of callus or horn; so that, when the disease was come up\nto that length, there was nothing could follow but certain death; and\nyet, as I said, they knew nothing of their being infected, nor found\nthemselves so much as out of order, till those mortal marks were upon\nthem. But everybody must allow that they were infected in a high degree\nbefore, and must have been so some time, and consequently their breath,\ntheir sweat, their very clothes, were contagious for many days before.\nThis occasioned a vast variety of cases which physicians would have much\nmore opportunity to remember than I; but some came within the compass of\nmy observation or hearing, of which I shall name a few.\n\nA certain citizen who had lived safe and untouched till the month of\nSeptember, when the weight of the distemper lay more in the city than it\nhad done before, was mighty cheerful, and something too bold (as I think\nit was) in his talk of how secure he was, how cautious he had been, and\nhow he had never come near any sick body. Says another citizen, a\nneighbour of his, to him one day, 'Do not be too confident, Mr--; it is\nhard to say who is sick and who is well, for we see men alive and well\nto outward appearance one hour, and dead the next.' 'That is true', says\nthe first man, for he was not a man presumptuously secure, but had\nescaped a long while--and men, as I said above, especially in the city\nbegan to be over-easy upon that score. 'That is true,' says he; 'I do\nnot think myself secure, but I hope I have not been in company with any\nperson that there has been any danger in.' 'No?' says his neighbour.\n'Was not you at the Bull Head Tavern in Gracechurch Street with Mr--the\nnight before last?' 'Yes,' says the first, 'I was; but there was nobody\nthere that we had any reason to think dangerous.' Upon which his\nneighbour said no more, being unwilling to surprise him; but this made\nhim more inquisitive, and as his neighbour appeared backward, he was the\nmore impatient, and in a kind of warmth says he aloud, 'Why, he is not\ndead, is he?' Upon which his neighbour still was silent, but cast up his\neyes and said something to himself; at which the first citizen turned\npale, and said no more but this, 'Then I am a dead man too', and went\nhome immediately and sent for a neighbouring apothecary to give him\nsomething preventive, for he had not yet found himself ill; but the\napothecary, opening his breast, fetched a sigh, and said no more but\nthis, 'Look up to God'; and the man died in a few hours.\n\nNow let any man judge from a case like this if it is possible for the\nregulations of magistrates, either by shutting up the sick or removing\nthem, to stop an infection which spreads itself from man to man even\nwhile they are perfectly well and insensible of its approach, and may be\nso for many days.\n\nIt may be proper to ask here how long it may be supposed men might have\nthe seeds of the contagion in them before it discovered itself in this\nfatal manner, and how long they might go about seemingly whole, and yet\nbe contagious to all those that came near them. I believe the most\nexperienced physicians cannot answer this question directly any more\nthan I can; and something an ordinary observer may take notice of, which\nmay pass their observations. The opinion of physicians abroad seems to\nbe that it may lie dormant in the spirits or in the blood-vessels a very\nconsiderable time. Why else do they exact a quarantine of those who came\ninto their harbours and ports from suspected places? Forty days is, one\nwould think, too long for nature to struggle with such an enemy as this,\nand not conquer it or yield to it. But I could not think, by my own\nobservation, that they can be infected so as to be contagious to others\nabove fifteen or sixteen days at furthest; and on that score it was,\nthat when a house was shut up in the city and any one had died of the\nplague, but nobody appeared to be ill in the family for sixteen or\neighteen days after, they were not so strict but that they would connive\nat their going privately abroad; nor would people be much afraid of them\nafterward, but rather think they were fortified the better, having not\nbeen vulnerable when the enemy was in their own house; but we sometimes\nfound it had lain much longer concealed.\n\nUpon the foot of all these observations I must say that though\nProvidence seemed to direct my conduct to be otherwise, yet it is my\nopinion, and I must leave it as a prescription, viz., that the best\nphysic against the plague is to run away from it. I know people\nencourage themselves by saying God is able to keep us in the midst of\ndanger, and able to overtake us when we think ourselves out of danger;\nand this kept thousands in the town whose carcases went into the great\npits by cartloads, and who, if they had fled from the danger, had, I\nbelieve, been safe from the disaster; at least 'tis probable they had\nbeen safe.\n\nAnd were this very fundamental only duly considered by the people on any\nfuture occasion of this or the like nature, I am persuaded it would put\nthem upon quite different measures for managing the people from those\nthat they took in 1665, or than any that have been taken abroad that I\nhave heard of. In a word, they would consider of separating the people\ninto smaller bodies, and removing them in time farther from one another-\n-and not let such a contagion as this, which is indeed chiefly dangerous\nto collected bodies of people, find a million of people in a body\ntogether, as was very near the case before, and would certainly be the\ncase if it should ever appear again.\n\nThe plague, like a great fire, if a few houses only are contiguous where\nit happens, can only burn a few houses; or if it begins in a single, or,\nas we call it, a lone house, can only burn that lone house where it\nbegins. But if it begins in a close-built town or city and gets a head,\nthere its fury increases: it rages over the whole place, and consumes\nall it can reach.\n\nI could propose many schemes on the foot of which the government of this\ncity, if ever they should be under the apprehensions of such another\nenemy (God forbid they should), might ease themselves of the greatest\npart of the dangerous people that belong to them; I mean such as the\nbegging, starving, labouring poor, and among them chiefly those who, in\ncase of a siege, are called the useless mouths; who being then prudently\nand to their own advantage disposed of, and the wealthy inhabitants\ndisposing of themselves and of their servants and children, the city and\nits adjacent parts would be so effectually evacuated that there would\nnot be above a tenth part of its people left together for the disease to\ntake hold upon. But suppose them to be a fifth part, and that two\nhundred and fifty thousand people were left: and if it did seize upon\nthem, they would, by their living so much at large, be much better\nprepared to defend themselves against the infection, and be less liable\nto the effects of it than if the same number of people lived close\ntogether in one smaller city such as Dublin or Amsterdam or the like.\n\nIt is true hundreds, yea, thousands of families fled away at this last\nplague, but then of them, many fled too late, and not only died in their\nflight, but carried the distemper with them into the countries where\nthey went and infected those whom they went among for safety; which\nconfounded the thing, and made that be a propagation of the distemper\nwhich was the best means to prevent it; and this too is an evidence of\nit, and brings me back to what I only hinted at before, but must speak\nmore fully to here, namely, that men went about apparently well many\ndays after they had the taint of the disease in their vitals, and after\ntheir spirits were so seized as that they could never escape it, and\nthat all the while they did so they were dangerous to others; I say,\nthis proves that so it was; for such people infected the very towns they\nwent through, as well as the families they went among; and it was by\nthat means that almost all the great towns in England had the distemper\namong them, more or less, and always they would tell you such a Londoner\nor such a Londoner brought it down.\n\nIt must not be omitted that when I speak of those people who were really\nthus dangerous, I suppose them to be utterly ignorant of their own\nconditions; for if they really knew their circumstances to be such as\nindeed they were, they must have been a kind of wilful murtherers if\nthey would have gone abroad among healthy people--and it would have\nverified indeed the suggestion which I mentioned above, and which I\nthought seemed untrue: viz., that the infected people were utterly\ncareless as to giving the infection to others, and rather forward to do\nit than not; and I believe it was partly from this very thing that they\nraised that suggestion, which I hope was not really true in fact.\n\nI confess no particular case is sufficient to prove a general, but I\ncould name several people within the knowledge of some of their\nneighbours and families yet living who showed the contrary to an\nextreme. One man, a master of a family in my neighbourhood, having had\nthe distemper, he thought he had it given him by a poor workman whom he\nemployed, and whom he went to his house to see, or went for some work\nthat he wanted to have finished; and he had some apprehensions even\nwhile he was at the poor workman's door, but did not discover it fully;\nbut the next day it discovered itself, and he was taken very in, upon\nwhich he immediately caused himself to be carried into an outbuilding\nwhich he had in his yard, and where there was a chamber over a workhouse\n(the man being a brazier). Here he lay, and here he died, and would be\ntended by none of his neighbours, but by a nurse from abroad; and would\nnot suffer his wife, nor children, nor servants to come up into the\nroom, lest they should be infected--but sent them his blessing and\nprayers for them by the nurse, who spoke it to them at a distance, and\nall this for fear of giving them the distemper; and without which he\nknew, as they were kept up, they could not have it.\n\nAnd here I must observe also that the plague, as I suppose all\ndistempers do, operated in a different manner on differing\nconstitutions; some were immediately overwhelmed with it, and it came to\nviolent fevers, vomitings, insufferable headaches, pains in the back,\nand so up to ravings and ragings with those pains; others with swellings\nand tumours in the neck or groin, or armpits, which till they could be\nbroke put them into insufferable agonies and torment; while others, as I\nhave observed, were silently infected, the fever preying upon their\nspirits insensibly, and they seeing little of it till they fell into\nswooning, and faintings, and death without pain. I am not physician\nenough to enter into the particular reasons and manner of these\ndiffering effects of one and the same distemper, and of its differing\noperation in several bodies; nor is it my business here to record the\nobservations which I really made, because the doctors themselves have\ndone that part much more effectually than I can do, and because my\nopinion may in some things differ from theirs. I am only relating what I\nknow, or have heard, or believe of the particular cases, and what fell\nwithin the compass of my view, and the different nature of the infection\nas it appeared in the particular cases which I have related; but this\nmay be added too: that though the former sort of those cases, namely,\nthose openly visited, were the worst for themselves as to pain--I mean\nthose that had such fevers, vomitings, headaches, pains, and swellings,\nbecause they died in such a dreadful manner--yet the latter had the\nworst state of the disease; for in the former they frequently recovered,\nespecially if the swellings broke; but the latter was inevitable death;\nno cure, no help, could be possible, nothing could follow but death. And\nit was worse also to others, because, as above, it secretly and\nunperceived by others or by themselves, communicated death to those they\nconversed with, the penetrating poison insinuating itself into their\nblood in a manner which it is impossible to describe, or indeed\nconceive.\n\nThis infecting and being infected without so much as its being known to\neither person is evident from two sorts of cases which frequently\nhappened at that time; and there is hardly anybody living who was in\nLondon during the infection but must have known several of the cases of\nboth sorts.\n\n(1) Fathers and mothers have gone about as if they had been well, and\nhave believed themselves to be so, till they have insensibly infected\nand been the destruction of their whole families, which they would have\nbeen far from doing if they had the least apprehensions of their being\nunsound and dangerous themselves. A family, whose story I have heard,\nwas thus infected by the father; and the distemper began to appear upon\nsome of them even before he found it upon himself. But searching more\nnarrowly, it appeared he had been affected some time; and as soon as he\nfound that his family had been poisoned by himself he went distracted,\nand would have laid violent hands upon himself, but was kept from that\nby those who looked to him, and in a few days died.\n\n(2) The other particular is, that many people having been well to the\nbest of their own judgement, or by the best observation which they could\nmake of themselves for several days, and only finding a decay of\nappetite, or a light sickness upon their stomachs; nay, some whose\nappetite has been strong, and even craving, and only a light pain in\ntheir heads, have sent for physicians to know what ailed them, and have\nbeen found, to their great surprise, at the brink of death: the tokens\nupon them, or the plague grown up to an incurable height.\n\nIt was very sad to reflect how such a person as this last mentioned\nabove had been a walking destroyer perhaps for a week or a fortnight\nbefore that; how he had ruined those that he would have hazarded his\nlife to save, and had been breathing death upon them, even perhaps in\nhis tender kissing and embracings of his own children. Yet thus\ncertainly it was, and often has been, and I could give many particular\ncases where it has been so. If then the blow is thus insensibly\nstriking--if the arrow flies thus unseen, and cannot be discovered--to\nwhat purpose are all the schemes for shutting up or removing the sick\npeople? Those schemes cannot take place but upon those that appear to be\nsick, or to be infected; whereas there are among them at the same time\nthousands of people who seem to be well, but are all that while carrying\ndeath with them into all companies which they come into.\n\nThis frequently puzzled our physicians, and especially the apothecaries\nand surgeons, who knew not how to discover the sick from the sound; they\nall allowed that it was really so, that many people had the plague in\ntheir very blood, and preying upon their spirits, and were in themselves\nbut walking putrefied carcases whose breath was infectious and their\nsweat poison, and yet were as well to look on as other people, and even\nknew it not themselves; I say, they all allowed that it was really true\nin fact, but they knew not how to propose a discovery.\n\nMy friend Dr Heath was of opinion that it might be known by the smell of\ntheir breath; but then, as he said, who durst smell to that breath for\nhis information? since, to know it, he must draw the stench of the\nplague up into his own brain, in order to distinguish the smell! I have\nheard it was the opinion of others that it might be distinguished by the\nparty's breathing upon a piece of glass, where, the breath condensing,\nthere might living creatures be seen by a microscope, of strange,\nmonstrous, and frightful shapes, such as dragons, snakes, serpents, and\ndevils, horrible to behold. But this I very much question the truth of,\nand we had no microscopes at that time, as I remember, to make the\nexperiment with.\n\nIt was the opinion also of another learned man, that the breath of such\na person would poison and instantly kill a bird; not only a small bird,\nbut even a cock or hen, and that, if it did not immediately kill the\nlatter, it would cause them to be roupy, as they call it; particularly\nthat if they had laid any eggs at any time, they would be all rotten.\nBut those are opinions which I never found supported by any experiments,\nor heard of others that had seen it; so I leave them as I find them;\nonly with this remark, namely, that I think the probabilities are very\nstrong for them.\n\nSome have proposed that such persons should breathe hard upon warm\nwater, and that they would leave an unusual scum upon it, or upon\nseveral other things, especially such as are of a glutinous substance\nand are apt to receive a scum and support it.\n\nBut from the whole I found that the nature of this contagion was such\nthat it was impossible to discover it at all, or to prevent its\nspreading from one to another by any human skill.\n\nHere was indeed one difficulty which I could never thoroughly get over\nto this time, and which there is but one way of answering that I know\nof, and it is this, viz., the first person that died of the plague was\non December 20, or thereabouts, 1664, and in or about long Acre; whence\nthe first person had the infection was generally said to be from a\nparcel of silks imported from Holland, and first opened in that house.\n\nBut after this we heard no more of any person dying of the plague, or of\nthe distemper being in that place, till the 9th of February, which was\nabout seven weeks after, and then one more was buried out of the same\nhouse. Then it was hushed, and we were perfectly easy as to the public\nfor a great while; for there were no more entered in the weekly bill to\nbe dead of the plague till the 22nd of April, when there was two more\nburied, not out of the same house, but out of the same street; and, as\nnear as I can remember, it was out of the next house to the first. This\nwas nine weeks asunder, and after this we had no more till a fortnight,\nand then it broke out in several streets and spread every way. Now the\nquestion seems to lie thus: Where lay the seeds of the infection all\nthis while? How came it to stop so long, and not stop any longer? Either\nthe distemper did not come immediately by contagion from body to body,\nor, if it did, then a body may be capable to continue infected without\nthe disease discovering itself many days, nay, weeks together; even not\na quarantine of days only, but soixantine; not only forty days, but\nsixty days or longer.\n\nIt is true there was, as I observed at first, and is well known to many\nyet living, a very cold winter and a long frost which continued three\nmonths; and this, the doctors say, might check the infection; but then\nthe learned must allow me to say that if, according to their notion, the\ndisease was (as I may say) only frozen up, it would like a frozen river\nhave returned to its usual force and current when it thawed--whereas the\nprincipal recess of this infection, which was from February to April,\nwas after the frost was broken and the weather mild and warm.\n\nBut there is another way of solving all this difficulty, which I think\nmy own remembrance of the thing will supply; and that is, the fact is\nnot granted--namely, that there died none in those long intervals, viz.,\nfrom the 20th of December to the 9th of February, and from thence to the\n22nd of April. The weekly bills are the only evidence on the other side,\nand those bills were not of credit enough, at least with me, to support\nan hypothesis or determine a question of such importance as this; for it\nwas our received opinion at that time, and I believe upon very good\ngrounds, that the fraud lay in the parish officers, searchers, and\npersons appointed to give account of the dead, and what diseases they\ndied of; and as people were very loth at first to have the neighbours\nbelieve their houses were infected, so they gave money to procure, or\notherwise procured, the dead persons to be returned as dying of other\ndistempers; and this I know was practised afterwards in many places, I\nbelieve I might say in all places where the distemper came, as will be\nseen by the vast increase of the numbers placed in the weekly bills\nunder other articles of diseases during the time of the infection. For\nexample, in the months of July and August, when the plague was coming on\nto its highest pitch, it was very ordinary to have from a thousand to\ntwelve hundred, nay, to almost fifteen hundred a week of other\ndistempers. Not that the numbers of those distempers were really\nincreased to such a degree, but the great number of families and houses\nwhere really the infection was, obtained the favour to have their dead\nbe returned of other distempers, to prevent the shutting up their\nhouses. For example:--\n\n\n     Dead of other diseases beside the plague--\n     -    From the 18th July  to  the 25th                     942\n     -    \"        25th July       \"  1st August              1004\n     -    \"         1st August     \"  8th                     1213\n     -    \"         8th            \" 15th                     1439\n     -    \"        15th            \" 22nd                     1331\n     -    \"        22nd            \" 29th                     1394\n     -    \"        29th            \"  5th September           1264\n     -    \"         5th September to the 12th                 1056\n     -    \"        12th            \" 19th                     1132\n     -    \"        19th            \" 26th                      927\n\nNow it was not doubted but the greatest part of these, or a great part\nof them, were dead of the plague, but the officers were prevailed with\nto return them as above, and the numbers of some particular articles of\ndistempers discovered is as follows:--\n\n\n\n     -         Aug.

Likewise, as I observed before, the burials increased weekly\nin that particular parish and the parishes adjacent more than in any\nother parish, although there were none set down of the plague; all which\ntells us, that the infection was handed on, and the succession of the\ndistemper really preserved, though it seemed to us at that time to be\nceased, and to come again in a manner surprising.\n\nIt might be, also, that the infection might remain in other parts of the\nsame parcel of goods which at first it came in, and which might not be\nperhaps opened, or at least not fully, or in the clothes of the first\ninfected person; for I cannot think that anybody could be seized with\nthe contagion in a fatal and mortal degree for nine weeks together, and\nsupport his state of health so well as even not to discover it to\nthemselves; yet if it were so, the argument is the stronger in favour of\nwhat I am saying: namely, that the infection is retained in bodies\napparently well, and conveyed from them to those they converse with,\nwhile it is known to neither the one nor the other.\n\nGreat were the confusions at that time upon this very account, and when\npeople began to be convinced that the infection was received in this\nsurprising manner from persons apparently well, they began to be\nexceeding shy and jealous of every one that came near them. Once, on a\npublic day, whether a Sabbath-day or not I do not remember, in Aldgate\nChurch, in a pew full of people, on a sudden one fancied she smelt an\nill smell. Immediately she fancies the plague was in the pew, whispers\nher notion or suspicion to the next, then rises and goes out of the pew.\nIt immediately took with the next, and so to them all; and every one of\nthem, and of the two or three adjoining pews, got up and went out of the\nchurch, nobody knowing what it was offended them, or from whom.\n\nThis immediately filled everybody's mouths with one preparation or\nother, such as the old woman directed, and some perhaps as physicians\ndirected, in order to prevent infection by the breath of others;\ninsomuch that if we came to go into a church when it was anything full\nof people, there would be such a mixture of smells at the entrance that\nit was much more strong, though perhaps not so wholesome, than if you\nwere going into an apothecary's or druggist's shop. In a word, the whole\nchurch was like a smelling-bottle; in one corner it was all perfumes; in\nanother, aromatics, balsamics, and variety of drugs and herbs; in\nanother, salts and spirits, as every one was furnished for their own\npreservation. Yet I observed that after people were possessed, as I have\nsaid, with the belief, or rather assurance, of the infection being thus\ncarried on by persons apparently in health, the churches and meeting-\nhouses were much thinner of people than at other times before that they\nused to be. For this is to be said of the people of London, that during\nthe whole time of the pestilence the churches or meetings were never\nwholly shut up, nor did the people decline coming out to the public\nworship of God, except only in some parishes when the violence of the\ndistemper was more particularly in that parish at that time, and even\nthen no longer than it continued to be so.\n\nIndeed nothing was more strange than to see with what courage the people\nwent to the public service of God, even at that time when they were\nafraid to stir out of their own houses upon any other occasion; this, I\nmean, before the time of desperation, which I have mentioned already.\nThis was a proof of the exceeding populousness of the city at the time\nof the infection, notwithstanding the great numbers that were gone into\nthe country at the first alarm, and that fled out into the forests and\nwoods when they were further terrified with the extraordinary increase\nof it. For when we came to see the crowds and throngs of people which\nappeared on the Sabbath-days at the churches, and especially in those\nparts of the town where the plague was abated, or where it was not yet\ncome to its height, it was amazing. But of this I shall speak again\npresently. I return in the meantime to the article of infecting one\nanother at first, before people came to right notions of the infection,\nand of infecting one another. People were only shy of those that were\nreally sick, a man with a cap upon his head, or with clothes round his\nneck, which was the case of those that had swellings there. Such was\nindeed frightful; but when we saw a gentleman dressed, with his band on\nand his gloves in his hand, his hat upon his head, and his hair combed,\nof such we had not the least apprehensions, and people conversed a great\nwhile freely, especially with their neighbours and such as they knew.\nBut when the physicians assured us that the danger was as well from the\nsound (that is, the seemingly sound) as the sick, and that those people\nwho thought themselves entirely free were oftentimes the most fatal, and\nthat it came to be generally understood that people were sensible of it,\nand of the reason of it; then, I say, they began to be jealous of\neverybody, and a vast number of people locked themselves up, so as not\nto come abroad into any company at all, nor suffer any that had been\nabroad in promiscuous company to come into their houses, or near them--\nat least not so near them as to be within the reach of their breath or\nof any smell from them; and when they were obliged to converse at a\ndistance with strangers, they would always have preservatives in their\nmouths and about their clothes to repel and keep off the infection.\n\nIt must be acknowledged that when people began to use these cautions\nthey were less exposed to danger, and the infection did not break into\nsuch houses so furiously as it did into others before; and thousands of\nfamilies were preserved (speaking with due reserve to the direction of\nDivine Providence) by that means.\n\nBut it was impossible to beat anything into the heads of the poor. They\nwent on with the usual impetuosity of their tempers, full of outcries\nand lamentations when taken, but madly careless of themselves, foolhardy\nand obstinate, while they were well. Where they could get employment\nthey pushed into any kind of business, the most dangerous and the most\nliable to infection; and if they were spoken to, their answer would be,\n'I must trust to God for that; if I am taken, then I am provided for,\nand there is an end of me', and the like. Or thus, 'Why, what must I do?\nI can't starve. I had as good have the plague as perish for want. I have\nno work; what could I do? I must do this or beg.' Suppose it was burying\nthe dead, or attending the sick, or watching infected houses, which were\nall terrible hazards; but their tale was generally the same. It is true,\nnecessity was a very justifiable, warrantable plea, and nothing could be\nbetter; but their way of talk was much the same where the necessities\nwere not the same. This adventurous conduct of the poor was that which\nbrought the plague among them in a most furious manner; and this, joined\nto the distress of their circumstances when taken, was the reason why\nthey died so by heaps; for I cannot say I could observe one jot of\nbetter husbandry among them, I mean the labouring poor, while they were\nall well and getting money than there was before, but as lavish, as\nextravagant, and as thoughtless for tomorrow as ever; so that when they\ncame to be taken sick they were immediately in the utmost distress, as\nwell for want as for sickness, as well for lack of food as lack of\nhealth.\n\nThis misery of the poor I had many occasions to be an eyewitness of, and\nsometimes also of the charitable assistance that some pious people daily\ngave to such, sending them relief and supplies both of food, physic, and\nother help, as they found they wanted; and indeed it is a debt of\njustice due to the temper of the people of that day to take notice here,\nthat not only great sums, very great sums of money were charitably sent\nto the Lord Mayor and aldermen for the assistance and support of the\npoor distempered people, but abundance of private people daily\ndistributed large sums of money for their relief, and sent people about\nto inquire into the condition of particular distressed and visited\nfamilies, and relieved them; nay, some pious ladies were so transported\nwith zeal in so good a work, and so confident in the protection of\nProvidence in discharge of the great duty of charity, that they went\nabout in person distributing alms to the poor, and even visiting poor\nfamilies, though sick and infected, in their very houses, appointing\nnurses to attend those that wanted attending, and ordering apothecaries\nand surgeons, the first to supply them with drugs or plasters, and such\nthings as they wanted; and the last to lance and dress the swellings and\ntumours, where such were wanting; giving their blessing to the poor in\nsubstantial relief to them, as well as hearty prayers for them.\n\nI will not undertake to say, as some do, that none of those charitable\npeople were suffered to fall under the calamity itself; but this I may\nsay, that I never knew any one of them that miscarried, which I mention\nfor the encouragement of others in case of the like distress; and\ndoubtless, if they that give to the poor lend to the Lord, and He will\nrepay them, those that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to\ncomfort and assist the poor in such a misery as this, may hope to be\nprotected in the work.\n\nNor was this charity so extraordinary eminent only in a few, but (for I\ncannot lightly quit this point) the charity of the rich, as well in the\ncity and suburbs as from the country, was so great that, in a word, a\nprodigious number of people who must otherwise inevitably have perished\nfor want as well as sickness were supported and subsisted by it; and\nthough I could never, nor I believe any one else, come to a full\nknowledge of what was so contributed, yet I do believe that, as I heard\none say that was a critical observer of that part, there was not only\nmany thousand pounds contributed, but many hundred thousand pounds, to\nthe relief of the poor of this distressed, afflicted city; nay, one man\naffirmed to me that he could reckon up above one hundred thousand pounds\na week, which was distributed by the churchwardens at the several parish\nvestries by the Lord Mayor and aldermen in the several wards and\nprecincts, and by the particular direction of the court and of the\njustices respectively in the parts where they resided, over and above\nthe private charity distributed by pious bands in the manner I speak of;\nand this continued for many weeks together.\n\nI confess this is a very great sum; but if it be true that there was\ndistributed in the parish of Cripplegate only, 17,800 in one week to the\nrelief of the poor, as I heard reported, and which I really believe was\ntrue, the other may not be improbable.\n\nIt was doubtless to be reckoned among the many signal good providences\nwhich attended this great city, and of which there were many other worth\nrecording,--I say, this was a very remarkable one, that it pleased God\nthus to move the hearts of the people in all parts of the kingdom so\ncheerfully to contribute to the relief and support of the poor at\nLondon, the good consequences of which were felt many ways, and\nparticularly in preserving the lives and recovering the health of so\nmany thousands, and keeping so many thousands of families from perishing\nand starving.\n\nAnd now I am talking of the merciful disposition of Providence in this\ntime of calamity, I cannot but mention again, though I have spoken\nseveral times of it already on other accounts, I mean that of the\nprogression of the distemper; how it began at one end of the town, and\nproceeded gradually and slowly from one part to another, and like a dark\ncloud that passes over our heads, which, as it thickens and overcasts\nthe air at one end, clears it up at the other end; so, while the plague went\non raging from west to east, as it went forwards east, it abated in the\nwest, by which means those parts of the town which were not seized, or\nwho were left, and where it had spent its fury, were (as it were) spared\nto help and assist the other; whereas, had the distemper spread itself\nover the whole city and suburbs, at once, raging in all places alike, as\nit has done since in some places abroad, the whole body of the people\nmust have been overwhelmed, and there would have died twenty thousand a\nday, as they say there did at Naples; nor would the people have been\nable to have helped or assisted one another.\n\nFor it must be observed that where the plague was in its full force,\nthere indeed the people were very miserable, and the consternation was\ninexpressible. But a little before it reached even to that place, or\npresently after it was gone, they were quite another sort of people; and\nI cannot but acknowledge that there was too much of that common temper\nof mankind to be found among us all at that time, namely, to forget the\ndeliverance when the danger is past. But I shall come to speak of that\npart again.\n\nIt must not be forgot here to take some notice of the state of trade\nduring the time of this common calamity, and this with respect to\nforeign trade, as also to our home trade.\n\nAs to foreign trade, there needs little to be said. The trading nations\nof Europe were all afraid of us; no port of France, or Holland, or\nSpain, or Italy would admit our ships or correspond with us; indeed we\nstood on ill terms with the Dutch, and were in a furious war with them,\nbut though in a bad condition to fight abroad, who had such dreadful\nenemies to struggle with at home.\n\nOur merchants were accordingly at a full stop; their ships could go\nnowhere--that is to say, to no place abroad; their manufactures and\nmerchandise--that is to say, of our growth--would not be touched abroad.\nThey were as much afraid of our goods as they were of our people; and\nindeed they had reason: for our woollen manufactures are as retentive of\ninfection as human bodies, and if packed up by persons infected, would\nreceive the infection and be as dangerous to touch as a man would be\nthat was infected; and therefore, when any English vessel arrived in\nforeign countries, if they did take the goods on shore, they always\ncaused the bales to be opened and aired in places appointed for that\npurpose. But from London they would not suffer them to come into port,\nmuch less to unlade their goods, upon any terms whatever, and this\nstrictness was especially used with them in Spain and Italy. In Turkey\nand the islands of the Arches indeed, as they are called, as well those\nbelonging to the Turks as to the Venetians, they were not so very rigid.\nIn the first there was no obstruction at all; and four ships which were\nthen in the river loading for Italy--that is, for Leghorn and Naples--\nbeing denied product, as they call it, went on to Turkey, and were\nfreely admitted to unlade their cargo without any difficulty; only that\nwhen they arrived there, some of their cargo was not fit for sale in\nthat country; and other parts of it being consigned to merchants at\nLeghorn, the captains of the ships had no right nor any orders to\ndispose of the goods; so that great inconveniences followed to the\nmerchants. But this was nothing but what the necessity of affairs\nrequired, and the merchants at Leghorn and Naples having notice given\nthem, sent again from thence to take care of the effects which were\nparticularly consigned to those ports, and to bring back in other ships\nsuch as were improper for the markets at Smyrna and Scanderoon.\n\nThe inconveniences in Spain and Portugal were still greater, for they\nwould by no means suffer our ships, especially those from London, to\ncome into any of their ports, much less to unlade. There was a report\nthat one of our ships having by stealth delivered her cargo, among which\nwas some bales of English cloth, cotton, kerseys, and such-like goods,\nthe Spaniards caused all the goods to be burned, and punished the men\nwith death who were concerned in carrying them on shore. This, I\nbelieve, was in part true, though I do not affirm it; but it is not at\nall unlikely, seeing the danger was really very great, the infection\nbeing so violent in London.\n\nI heard likewise that the plague was carried into those countries by\nsome of our ships, and particularly to the port of Faro in the kingdom\nof Algarve, belonging to the King of Portugal, and that several persons\ndied of it there; but it was not confirmed.\n\nOn the other hand, though the Spaniards and Portuguese were so shy of\nus, it is most certain that the plague (as has been said) keeping at\nfirst much at that end of the town next Westminster, the merchandising\npart of the town (such as the city and the water-side) was perfectly\nsound till at least the beginning of July, and the ships in the river\ntill the beginning of August; for to the 1st of July there had died but\nseven within the whole city, and but sixty within the liberties, but one\nin all the parishes of Stepney, Aldgate, and Whitechappel, and but two\nin the eight parishes of Southwark. But it was the same thing abroad,\nfor the bad news was gone over the whole world that the city of London\nwas infected with the plague, and there was no inquiring there how the\ninfection proceeded, or at which part of the town it was begun or was\nreached to.\n\nBesides, after it began to spread it increased so fast, and the bills\ngrew so high all on a sudden, that it was to no purpose to lessen the\nreport of it, or endeavour to make the people abroad think it better\nthan it was; the account which the weekly bills gave in was sufficient;\nand that there died two thousand to three or four thousand a week was\nsufficient to alarm the whole trading part of the world; and the\nfollowing time, being so dreadful also in the very city itself, put the\nwhole world, I say, upon their guard against it.\n\nYou may be sure, also, that the report of these things lost nothing in\nthe carriage. The plague was itself very terrible, and the distress of\nthe people very great, as you may observe of what I have said. But the\nrumour was infinitely greater, and it must not be wondered that our\nfriends abroad (as my brother's correspondents in particular were told\nthere, namely, in Portugal and Italy, where he chiefly traded) [said]\nthat in London there died twenty thousand in a week; that the dead\nbodies lay unburied by heaps; that the living were not sufficient to\nbury the dead or the sound to look after the sick; that all the kingdom\nwas infected likewise, so that it was an universal malady such as was\nnever heard of in those parts of the world; and they could hardly\nbelieve us when we gave them an account how things really were, and how\nthere was not above one-tenth part of the people dead; that there was\n500,000, left that lived all the time in the town; that now the people\nbegan to walk the streets again, and those who were fled to return,\nthere was no miss of the usual throng of people in the streets, except\nas every family might miss their relations and neighbours, and the like.\nI say they could not believe these things; and if inquiry were now to be\nmade in Naples, or in other cities on the coast of Italy, they would\ntell you that there was a dreadful infection in London so many years\nago, in which, as above, there died twenty thousand in a week, &c., just\nas we have had it reported in London that there was a plague in the city\nof Naples in the year 1656, in which there died 20,000 people in a day,\nof which I have had very good satisfaction that it was utterly false.\n\nBut these extravagant reports were very prejudicial to our trade, as\nwell as unjust and injurious in themselves, for it was a long time after\nthe plague was quite over before our trade could recover itself in those\nparts of the world; and the Flemings and Dutch (but especially the last)\nmade very great advantages of it, having all the market to themselves,\nand even buying our manufactures in several parts of England where the\nplague was not, and carrying them to Holland and Flanders, and from\nthence transporting them to Spain and to Italy as if they had been of\ntheir own making.\n\nBut they were detected sometimes and punished: that is to say, their\ngoods confiscated and ships also; for if it was true that our\nmanufactures as well as our people were infected, and that it was\ndangerous to touch or to open and receive the smell of them, then those\npeople ran the hazard by that clandestine trade not only of carrying the\ncontagion into their own country, but also of infecting the nations to\nwhom they traded with those goods; which, considering how many lives\nmight be lost in consequence of such an action, must be a trade that no\nmen of conscience could suffer themselves to be concerned in.\n\nI do not take upon me to say that any harm was done, I mean of that\nkind, by those people. But I doubt I need not make any such proviso in\nthe case of our own country; for either by our people of London, or by\nthe commerce which made their conversing with all sorts of people in\nevery country and of every considerable town necessary, I say, by this\nmeans the plague was first or last spread all over the kingdom, as well\nin London as in all the cities and great towns, especially in the\ntrading manufacturing towns and seaports; so that, first or last, all\nthe considerable places in England were visited more or less, and the\nkingdom of Ireland in some places, but not so universally. How it fared\nwith the people in Scotland I had no opportunity to inquire.\n\nIt is to be observed that while the plague continued so violent in\nLondon, the outports, as they are called, enjoyed a very great trade,\nespecially to the adjacent countries and to our own plantations. For\nexample, the towns of Colchester, Yarmouth, and Hull, on that side of\nEngland, exported to Holland and Hamburg the manufactures of the\nadjacent countries for several months after the trade with London was,\nas it were, entirely shut up; likewise the cities of Bristol and Exeter,\nwith the port of Plymouth, had the like advantage to Spain, to the\nCanaries, to Guinea, and to the West Indies, and particularly to\nIreland; but as the plague spread itself every way after it had been in\nLondon to such a degree as it was in August and September, so all or\nmost of those cities and towns were infected first or last; and then\ntrade was, as it were, under a general embargo or at a full stop--as I\nshall observe further when I speak of our home trade.\n\nOne thing, however, must be observed: that as to ships coming in from\nabroad (as many, you may be sure, did) some who were out in all parts of\nthe world a considerable while before, and some who when they went out\nknew nothing of an infection, or at least of one so terrible--these came\nup the river boldly, and delivered their cargoes as they were obliged to\ndo, except just in the two months of August and September, when the\nweight of the infection lying, as I may say, all below Bridge, nobody\ndurst appear in business for a while. But as this continued but for a\nfew weeks, the homeward-bound ships, especially such whose cargoes were\nnot liable to spoil, came to an anchor for a time short of the Pool,* or\nfresh-water part of the river, even as low as the river Medway, where\nseveral of them ran in; and others lay at the Nore, and in the Hope\nbelow Gravesend. So that by the latter end of October there was a very\ngreat fleet of homeward-bound ships to come up, such as the like had not\nbeen known for many years.\n\n\n     * That part of the river where the ships lie up when they\n     come home is called the Pool, and takes in all the river on\n     both sides of the water, from the Tower to Cuckold's Point\n     and Limehouse. [Footnote in the original.]\n\nTwo particular trades were carried on by water-carriage all the while of\nthe infection, and that with little or no interruption, very much to the\nadvantage and comfort of the poor distressed people of the city: and\nthose were the coasting trade for corn and the Newcastle trade for\ncoals.\n\nThe first of these was particularly carried on by small vessels from the\nport of Hull and other places on the Humber, by which great quantities\nof corn were brought in from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The other part\nof this corn-trade was from Lynn, in Norfolk, from Wells and Burnham,\nand from Yarmouth, all in the same county; and the third branch was from\nthe river Medway, and from Milton, Feversham, Margate, and Sandwich, and\nall the other little places and ports round the coast of Kent and Essex.\n\nThere was also a very good trade from the coast of Suffolk with corn,\nbutter, and cheese; these vessels kept a constant course of trade, and\nwithout interruption came up to that market known still by the name of\nBear Key, where they supplied the city plentifully with corn when land-\ncarriage began to fail, and when the people began to be sick of coming\nfrom many places in the country.\n\nThis also was much of it owing to the prudence and conduct of the Lord\nMayor, who took such care to keep the masters and seamen from danger\nwhen they came up, causing their corn to be bought off at any time they\nwanted a market (which, however, was very seldom), and causing the corn-\nfactors immediately to unlade and deliver the vessels loaden with corn,\nthat they had very little occasion to come out of their ships or\nvessels, the money being always carried on board to them and put into a\npail of vinegar before it was carried.\n\nThe second trade was that of coals from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, without\nwhich the city would have been greatly distressed; for not in the\nstreets only, but in private houses and families, great quantities of\ncoals were then burnt, even all the summer long and when the weather was\nhottest, which was done by the advice of the physicians. Some indeed\nopposed it, and insisted that to keep the houses and rooms hot was a\nmeans to propagate the temper, which was a fermentation and heat already\nin the blood; that it was known to spread and increase in hot weather\nand abate in cold; and therefore they alleged that all contagious\ndistempers are the worse for heat, because the contagion was nourished\nand gained strength in hot weather, and was, as it were, propagated in\nheat.\n\nOthers said they granted that heat in the climate might propagate\ninfection--as sultry, hot weather fills the air with vermin and\nnourishes innumerable numbers and kinds of venomous creatures which\nbreed in our food, in the plants, and even in our bodies, by the very\nstench of which infection may be propagated; also that heat in the air,\nor heat of weather, as we ordinarily call it, makes bodies relax and\nfaint, exhausts the spirits, opens the pores, and makes us more apt to\nreceive infection, or any evil influence, be it from noxious\npestilential vapours or any other thing in the air; but that the heat of\nfire, and especially of coal fires kept in our houses, or near us, had a\nquite different operation; the heat being not of the same kind, but\nquick and fierce, tending not to nourish but to consume and dissipate\nall those noxious fumes which the other kind of heat rather exhaled and\nstagnated than separated and burnt up. Besides, it was alleged that the\nsulphurous and nitrous particles that are often found to be in the coal,\nwith that bituminous substance which burns, are all assisting to clear\nand purge the air, and render it wholesome and safe to breathe in after\nthe noxious particles, as above, are dispersed and burnt up.\n\nThe latter opinion prevailed at that time, and, as I must confess, I\nthink with good reason; and the experience of the citizens confirmed it,\nmany houses which had constant fires kept in the rooms having never been\ninfected at all; and I must join my experience to it, for I found the\nkeeping good fires kept our rooms sweet and wholesome, and I do verily\nbelieve made our whole family so, more than would otherwise have been.\n\nBut I return to the coals as a trade. It was with no little difficulty\nthat this trade was kept open, and particularly because, as we were in\nan open war with the Dutch at that time, the Dutch capers at first\ntook a great many of our collier-ships, which made the rest cautious,\nand made them to stay to come in fleets together. But after some time\nthe capers were either afraid to take them, or their masters, the\nStates, were afraid they should, and forbade them, lest the plague\nshould be among them, which made them fare the better.\n\nFor the security of those northern traders, the coal-ships were ordered\nby my Lord Mayor not to come up into the Pool above a certain number at\na time, and ordered lighters and other vessels such as the woodmongers\n(that is, the wharf-keepers or coal-sellers) furnished, to go down and\ntake out the coals as low as Deptford and Greenwich, and some farther\ndown.\n\nOthers delivered great quantities of coals in particular places where\nthe ships could come to the shore, as at Greenwich, Blackwall, and other\nplaces, in vast heaps, as if to be kept for sale; but were then fetched\naway after the ships which brought them were gone, so that the seamen\nhad no communication with the river-men, nor so much as came near one\nanother.\n\nYet all this caution could not effectually prevent the distemper getting\namong the colliery: that is to say among the ships, by which a great\nmany seamen died of it; and that which was still worse was, that they\ncarried it down to Ipswich and Yarmouth, to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and\nother places on the coast--where, especially at Newcastle and at\nSunderland, it carried off a great number of people.\n\nThe making so many fires, as above, did indeed consume an unusual\nquantity of coals; and that upon one or two stops of the ships coming\nup, whether by contrary weather or by the interruption of enemies I do\nnot remember, but the price of coals was exceeding dear, even as high as\n4 l. a chalder; but it soon abated when the ships came in, and as\nafterwards they had a freer passage, the price was very reasonable all\nthe rest of that year.\n\nThe public fires which were made on these occasions, as I have\ncalculated it, must necessarily have cost the city about 200 chalders of\ncoals a week, if they had continued, which was indeed a very great\nquantity; but as it was thought necessary, nothing was spared. However,\nas some of the physicians cried them down, they were not kept alight\nabove four or five days. The fires were ordered thus:--\n\nOne at the Custom House, one at Billingsgate, one at Queenhith, and one\nat the Three Cranes; one in Blackfriars, and one at the gate of\nBridewell; one at the corner of Leadenhal Street and Gracechurch; one at\nthe north and one at the south gate of the Royal Exchange; one at Guild\nHall, and one at Blackwell Hall gate; one at the Lord Mayor's door in St\nHelen's, one at the west entrance into St Paul's, and one at the\nentrance into Bow Church. I do not remember whether there was any at the\ncity gates, but one at the Bridge-foot there was, just by St Magnus\nChurch.\n\nI know some have quarrelled since that at the experiment, and said that\nthere died the more people because of those fires; but I am persuaded\nthose that say so offer no evidence to prove it, neither can I believe\nit on any account whatever.\n\nIt remains to give some account of the state of trade at home in England\nduring this dreadful time, and particularly as it relates to the\nmanufactures and the trade in the city. At the first breaking out of the\ninfection there was, as it is easy to suppose, a very great fright among\nthe people, and consequently a general stop of trade, except in\nprovisions and necessaries of life; and even in those things, as there\nwas a vast number of people fled and a very great number always sick,\nbesides the number which died, so there could not be above two-thirds,\nif above one-half, of the consumption of provisions in the city as used\nto be.\n\nIt pleased God to send a very plentiful year of corn and fruit, but not\nof hay or grass--by which means bread was cheap, by reason of the plenty\nof corn. Flesh was cheap, by reason of the scarcity of grass; but butter\nand cheese were dear for the same reason, and hay in the market just\nbeyond Whitechappel Bars was sold at 4 pound per load. But that affected\nnot the poor. There was a most excessive plenty of all sorts of fruit,\nsuch as apples, pears, plums, cherries, grapes, and they were the\ncheaper because of the want of people; but this made the poor eat them\nto excess, and this brought them into fluxes, griping of the guts,\nsurfeits, and the like, which often precipitated them into the plague.\n\nBut to come to matters of trade. First, foreign exportation being\nstopped or at least very much interrupted and rendered difficult, a\ngeneral stop of all those manufactures followed of course which were\nusually brought for exportation; and though sometimes merchants abroad\nwere importunate for goods, yet little was sent, the passages being so\ngenerally stopped that the English ships would not be admitted, as is\nsaid already, into their port.\n\nThis put a stop to the manufactures that were for exportation in most\nparts of England, except in some out-ports; and even that was soon\nstopped, for they all had the plague in their turn. But though this was\nfelt all over England, yet, what was still worse, all intercourse of\ntrade for home consumption of manufactures, especially those which\nusually circulated through the Londoner's hands, was stopped at once,\nthe trade of the city being stopped.\n\nAll kinds of handicrafts in the city, &c., tradesmen and mechanics,\nwere, as I have said before, out of employ; and this occasioned the\nputting-off and dismissing an innumerable number of journeymen and\nworkmen of all sorts, seeing nothing was done relating to such trades\nbut what might be said to be absolutely necessary.\n\nThis caused the multitude of single people in London to be unprovided\nfor, as also families whose living depended upon the labour of the heads\nof those families; I say, this reduced them to extreme misery; and I\nmust confess it is for the honour of the city of London, and will be for\nmany ages, as long as this is to be spoken of, that they were able to\nsupply with charitable provision the wants of so many thousands of those\nas afterwards fell sick and were distressed: so that it may be safely\naverred that nobody perished for want, at least that the magistrates had\nany notice given them of.\n\nThis stagnation of our manufacturing trade in the country would have put\nthe people there to much greater difficulties, but that the master-\nworkmen, clothiers and others, to the uttermost of their stocks and\nstrength, kept on making their goods to keep the poor at work, believing\nthat soon as the sickness should abate they would have a quick demand in\nproportion to the decay of their trade at that time. But as none but\nthose masters that were rich could do thus, and that many were poor and\nnot able, the manufacturing trade in England suffered greatly, and the\npoor were pinched all over England by the calamity of the city of London\nonly.\n\nIt is true that the next year made them full amends by another terrible\ncalamity upon the city; so that the city by one calamity impoverished\nand weakened the country, and by another calamity, even terrible too of\nits kind, enriched the country and made them again amends; for an\ninfinite quantity of household Stuff, wearing apparel, and other things,\nbesides whole warehouses filled with merchandise and manufactures such\nas come from all parts of England, were consumed in the fire of London\nthe next year after this terrible visitation. It is incredible what a\ntrade this made all over the whole kingdom, to make good the want and to\nsupply that loss; so that, in short, all the manufacturing hands in the\nnation were set on work, and were little enough for several years to\nsupply the market and answer the demands. All foreign markets also were\nempty of our goods by the stop which had been occasioned by the plague,\nand before an open trade was allowed again; and the prodigious demand at\nhome falling in, joined to make a quick vent for all sort of goods; so\nthat there never was known such a trade all over England for the time as\nwas in the first seven years after the plague, and after the fire of\nLondon.\n\nIt remains now that I should say something of the merciful part of this\nterrible judgement. The last week in September, the plague being come to\nits crisis, its fury began to assuage. I remember my friend Dr Heath,\ncoming to see me the week before, told me he was sure that the violence\nof it would assuage in a few days; but when I saw the weekly bill of\nthat week, which was the highest of the whole year, being 8297 of all\ndiseases, I upbraided him with it, and asked him what he had made his\njudgement from. His answer, however, was not so much to seek as I\nthought it would have been. 'Look you,' says he, 'by the number which\nare at this time sick and infected, there should have been twenty\nthousand dead the last week instead of eight thousand, if the inveterate\nmortal contagion had been as it was two weeks ago; for then it\nordinarily killed in two or three days, now not under eight or ten; and\nthen not above one in five recovered, whereas I have observed that now\nnot above two in five miscarry. And, observe it from me, the next bill\nwill decrease, and you will see many more people recover than used to\ndo; for though a vast multitude are now everywhere infected, and as many\nevery day fall sick, yet there will not so many die as there did, for\nthe malignity of the distemper is abated';--adding that he began now to\nhope, nay, more than hope, that the infection had passed its crisis and\nwas going off; and accordingly so it was, for the next week being, as I\nsaid, the last in September, the bill decreased almost two thousand.\n\nIt is true the plague was still at a frightful height, and the next bill\nwas no less than 6460, and the next to that, 5720; but still my friend's\nobservation was just, and it did appear the people did recover faster\nand more in number than they used to do; and indeed, if it had not been\nso, what had been the condition of the city of London? For, according to\nmy friend, there were not fewer than 60,000 people at that time\ninfected, whereof, as above, 20,477 died, and near 40,000 recovered;\nwhereas, had it been as it was before, 50,000 of that number would very\nprobably have died, if not more, and 50,000 more would have sickened;\nfor, in a word, the whole mass of people began to sicken, and it looked\nas if none would escape.\n\nBut this remark of my friend's appeared more evident in a few weeks\nmore, for the decrease went on, and another week in October it decreased\n1843, so that the number dead of the plague was but 2665; and the next\nweek it decreased 1413 more, and yet it was seen plainly that there was\nabundance of people sick, nay, abundance more than ordinary, and\nabundance fell sick every day but (as above) the malignity of the\ndisease abated.\n\nSuch is the precipitant disposition of our people (whether it is so or\nnot all over the world, that's none of my particular business to\ninquire), but I saw it apparently here, that as upon the first fright of\nthe infection they shunned one another, and fled from one another's\nhouses and from the city with an unaccountable and, as I thought,\nunnecessary fright, so now, upon this notion spreading, viz., that the\ndistemper was not so catching as formerly, and that if it was catched it\nwas not so mortal, and seeing abundance of people who really fell sick\nrecover again daily, they took to such a precipitant courage, and grew\nso entirely regardless of themselves and of the infection, that they\nmade no more of the plague than of an ordinary fever, nor indeed so\nmuch. They not only went boldly into company with those who had tumours\nand carbuncles upon them that were running, and consequently contagious,\nbut ate and drank with them, nay, into their houses to visit them, and\neven, as I was told, into their very chambers where they lay sick.\n\nThis I could not see rational. My friend Dr Heath allowed, and it was\nplain to experience, that the distemper was as catching as ever, and as\nmany fell sick, but only he alleged that so many of those that fell sick\ndid not die; but I think that while many did die, and that at best the\ndistemper itself was very terrible, the sores and swellings very\ntormenting, and the danger of death not left out of the circumstances of\nsickness, though not so frequent as before; all those things, together\nwith the exceeding tediousness of the cure, the loathsomeness of the\ndisease, and many other articles, were enough to deter any man living\nfrom a dangerous mixture with the sick people, and make them as anxious\nalmost to avoid the infections as before.\n\nNay, there was another thing which made the mere catching of the\ndistemper frightful, and that was the terrible burning of the caustics\nwhich the surgeons laid on the swellings to bring them to break and to\nrun, without which the danger of death was very great, even to the last.\nAlso, the insufferable torment of the swellings, which, though it might\nnot make people raving and distracted, as they were before, and as I\nhave given several instances of already, yet they put the patient to\ninexpressible torment; and those that fell into it, though they did\nescape with life, yet they made bitter complaints of those that had told\nthem there was no danger, and sadly repented their rashness and folly in\nventuring to run into the reach of it.\n\nNor did this unwary conduct of the people end here, for a great many\nthat thus cast off their cautions suffered more deeply still, and though\nmany escaped, yet many died; and at least it had this public mischief\nattending it, that it made the decrease of burials slower than it would\notherwise have been. For as this notion ran like lightning through the\ncity, and people's heads were possessed with it, even as soon as the\nfirst great decrease in the bills appeared, we found that the two next\nbills did not decrease in proportion; the reason I take to be the\npeople's running so rashly into danger, giving up all their former\ncautions and care, and all the shyness which they used to practise,\ndepending that the sickness would not reach them--or that if it did,\nthey should not die.\n\nThe physicians opposed this thoughtless humour of the people with all\ntheir might, and gave out printed directions, spreading them all over\nthe city and suburbs, advising the people to continue reserved, and to\nuse still the utmost caution in their ordinary conduct, notwithstanding\nthe decrease of the distemper, terrifying them with the danger of\nbringing a relapse upon the whole city, and telling them how such a\nrelapse might be more fatal and dangerous than the whole visitation that\nhad been already; with many arguments and reasons to explain and prove\nthat part to them, and which are too long to repeat here.\n\nBut it was all to no purpose; the audacious creatures were so possessed\nwith the first joy and so surprised with the satisfaction of seeing a\nvast decrease in the weekly bills, that they were impenetrable by any\nnew terrors, and would not be persuaded but that the bitterness of death\nwas past; and it was to no more purpose to talk to them than to an east\nwind; but they opened shops, went about streets, did business, and\nconversed with anybody that came in their way to converse with, whether\nwith business or without, neither inquiring of their health or so much\nas being apprehensive of any danger from them, though they knew them not\nto be sound.\n\nThis imprudent, rash conduct cost a great many their lives who had with\ngreat care and caution shut themselves up and kept retired, as it were,\nfrom all mankind, and had by that means, under God's providence, been\npreserved through all the heat of that infection.\n\nThis rash and foolish conduct, I say, of the people went so far that the\nministers took notice to them of it at last, and laid before them both\nthe folly and danger of it; and this checked it a little, so that they\ngrew more cautious. But it had another effect, which they could not\ncheck; for as the first rumour had spread not over the city only, but\ninto the country, it had the like effect: and the people were so tired\nwith being so long from London, and so eager to come back, that they\nflocked to town without fear or forecast, and began to show themselves\nin the streets as if all the danger was over. It was indeed surprising\nto see it, for though there died still from 1000 to 1800 a week, yet the\npeople flocked to town as if all had been well.\n\nThe consequence of this was, that the bills increased again 400 the very\nfirst week in November; and if I might believe the physicians, there was\nabove 3000 fell sick that week, most of them new-comers, too.\n\nOne John Cock, a barber in St Martin's-le-Grand, was an eminent example\nof this; I mean of the hasty return of the people when the plague was\nabated. This John Cock had left the town with his whole family, and\nlocked up his house, and was gone in the country, as many others did;\nand finding the plague so decreased in November that there died but 905\nper week of all diseases, he ventured home again. He had in his family\nten persons; that is to say, himself and wife, five children, two\napprentices, and a maid-servant. He had not returned to his house above\na week, and began to open his shop and carry on his trade, but the\ndistemper broke out in his family, and within about five days they all\ndied, except one; that is to say, himself, his wife, all his five\nchildren, and his two apprentices; and only the maid remained alive.\n\nBut the mercy of God was greater to the rest than we had reason to\nexpect; for the malignity (as I have said) of the distemper was spent,\nthe contagion was exhausted, and also the winter weather came on apace,\nand the air was clear and cold, with sharp frosts; and this increasing\nstill, most of those that had fallen sick recovered, and the health of\nthe city began to return. There were indeed some returns of the\ndistemper even in the month of December, and the bills increased near a\nhundred; but it went off again, and so in a short while things began to\nreturn to their own channel. And wonderful it was to see how populous\nthe city was again all on a sudden, so that a stranger could not miss\nthe numbers that were lost. Neither was there any miss of the\ninhabitants as to their dwellings--few or no empty houses were to be\nseen, or if there were some, there was no want of tenants for them.\n\nI wish I could say that as the city had a new face, so the manners of\nthe people had a new appearance. I doubt not but there were many that\nretained a sincere sense of their deliverance, and were that heartily\nthankful to that Sovereign Hand that had protected them in so dangerous\na time; it would be very uncharitable to judge otherwise in a city so\npopulous, and where the people were so devout as they were here in the\ntime of the visitation itself; but except what of this was to be found\nin particular families and faces, it must be acknowledged that the\ngeneral practice of the people was just as it was before, and very\nlittle difference was to be seen.\n\nSome, indeed, said things were worse; that the morals of the people\ndeclined from this very time; that the people, hardened by the danger\nthey had been in, like seamen after a storm is over, were more wicked\nand more stupid, more bold and hardened, in their vices and immoralities\nthan they were before; but I will not carry it so far neither. It would\ntake up a history of no small length to give a particular of all the\ngradations by which the course of things in this city came to be\nrestored again, and to run in their own channel as they did before.\n\nSome parts of England were now infected as violently as London had been;\nthe cities of Norwich, Peterborough, Lincoln, Colchester, and other\nplaces were now visited; and the magistrates of London began to set\nrules for our conduct as to corresponding with those cities. It is true\nwe could not pretend to forbid their people coming to London, because it\nwas impossible to know them asunder; so, after many consultations, the\nLord Mayor and Court of Aldermen were obliged to drop it. All they could\ndo was to warn and caution the people not to entertain in their houses\nor converse with any people who they knew came from such infected\nplaces.\n\nBut they might as well have talked to the air, for the people of London\nthought themselves so plague-free now that they were past all\nadmonitions; they seemed to depend upon it that the air was restored,\nand that the air was like a man that had had the smallpox, not capable\nof being infected again. This revived that notion that the infection was\nall in the air, that there was no such thing as contagion from the sick\npeople to the sound; and so strongly did this whimsy prevail among\npeople that they ran all together promiscuously, sick and well. Not the\nMahometans, who, prepossessed with the principle of predestination,\nvalue nothing of contagion, let it be in what it will, could be more\nobstinate than the people of London; they that were perfectly sound, and\ncame out of the wholesome air, as we call it, into the city, made\nnothing of going into the same houses and chambers, nay, even into the\nsame beds, with those that had the distemper upon them, and were not\nrecovered.\n\nSome, indeed, paid for their audacious boldness with the price of their\nlives; an infinite number fell sick, and the physicians had more work\nthan ever, only with this difference, that more of their patients\nrecovered; that is to say, they generally recovered, but certainly there\nwere more people infected and fell sick now, when there did not die\nabove a thousand or twelve hundred in a week, than there was when there\ndied five or six thousand a week, so entirely negligent were the people\nat that time in the great and dangerous case of health and infection,\nand so ill were they able to take or accept of the advice of those who\ncautioned them for their good.\n\nThe people being thus returned, as it were, in general, it was very\nstrange to find that in their inquiring after their friends, some whole\nfamilies were so entirely swept away that there was no remembrance of\nthem left, neither was anybody to be found to possess or show any title\nto that little they had left; for in such cases what was to be found was\ngenerally embezzled and purloined, some gone one way, some another.\n\nIt was said such abandoned effects came to the king, as the universal\nheir; upon which we are told, and I suppose it was in part true, that\nthe king granted all such, as deodands, to the Lord Mayor and Court of\nAldermen of London, to be applied to the use of the poor, of whom there\nwere very many. For it is to be observed, that though the occasions of\nrelief and the objects of distress were very many more in the time of\nthe violence of the plague than now after all was over, yet the distress\nof the poor was more now a great deal than it was then, because all the\nsluices of general charity were now shut. People supposed the main\noccasion to be over, and so stopped their hands; whereas particular\nobjects were still very moving, and the distress of those that were poor\nwas very great indeed.\n\nThough the health of the city was now very much restored, yet foreign\ntrade did not begin to stir, neither would foreigners admit our ships\ninto their ports for a great while. As for the Dutch, the\nmisunderstandings between our court and them had broken out into a war\nthe year before, so that our trade that way was wholly interrupted; but\nSpain and Portugal, Italy and Barbary, as also Hamburg and all the ports\nin the Baltic, these were all shy of us a great while, and would not\nrestore trade with us for many months.\n\nThe distemper sweeping away such multitudes, as I have observed, many if\nnot all the out-parishes were obliged to make new burying-grounds,\nbesides that I have mentioned in Bunhill Fields, some of which were\ncontinued, and remain in use to this day. But others were left off, and\n(which I confess I mention with some reflection) being converted into\nother uses or built upon afterwards, the dead bodies were disturbed,\nabused, dug up again, some even before the flesh of them was perished\nfrom the bones, and removed like dung or rubbish to other places. Some\nof those which came within the reach of my observation are as follow:\n\n(1) A piece of ground beyond Goswell Street, near Mount Mill, being some\nof the remains of the old lines or fortifications of the city, where\nabundance were buried promiscuously from the parishes of Aldersgate,\nClerkenwell, and even out of the city. This ground, as I take it, was\nsince made a physic garden, and after that has been built upon.\n\n(2) A piece of ground just over the Black Ditch, as it was then called,\nat the end of Holloway Lane, in Shoreditch parish. It has been since\nmade a yard for keeping hogs, and for other ordinary uses, but is quite\nout of use as a burying-ground.\n\n(3) The upper end of Hand Alley, in Bishopsgate Street, which was then a\ngreen field, and was taken in particularly for Bishopsgate parish,\nthough many of the carts out of the city brought their dead thither\nalso, particularly out of the parish of St All-hallows on the Wall. This\nplace I cannot mention without much regret. It was, as I remember, about\ntwo or three years after the plague was ceased that Sir Robert Clayton\ncame to be possessed of the ground. It was reported, how true I know\nnot, that it fell to the king for want of heirs, all those who had any\nright to it being carried off by the pestilence, and that Sir Robert\nClayton obtained a grant of it from King Charles II. But however he came\nby it, certain it is the ground was let out to build on, or built upon,\nby his order. The first house built upon it was a large fair house,\nstill standing, which faces the street or way now called Hand Alley\nwhich, though called an alley, is as wide as a street. The houses in the\nsame row with that house northward are built on the very same ground\nwhere the poor people were buried, and the bodies, on opening the ground\nfor the foundations, were dug up, some of them remaining so plain to be\nseen that the women's skulls were distinguished by their long hair, and\nof others the flesh was not quite perished; so that the people began to\nexclaim loudly against it, and some suggested that it might endanger a\nreturn of the contagion; after which the bones and bodies, as fast as\nthey came at them, were carried to another part of the same ground and\nthrown all together into a deep pit, dug on purpose, which now is to be\nknown in that it is not built on, but is a passage to another house at\nthe upper end of Rose Alley, just against the door of a meeting-house\nwhich has been built there many years since; and the ground is\npalisadoed off from the rest of the passage, in a little square; there\nlie the bones and remains of near two thousand bodies, carried by the\ndead carts to their grave in that one year.\n\n(4) Besides this, there was a piece of ground in Moorfields; by the\ngoing into the street which is now called Old Bethlem, which was\nenlarged much, though not wholly taken in on the same occasion.\n\n[N.B.--The author of this journal lies buried in that very ground, being\nat his own desire, his sister having been buried there a few years\nbefore.]\n\n(5) Stepney parish, extending itself from the east part of London to the\nnorth, even to the very edge of Shoreditch Churchyard, had a piece of\nground taken in to bury their dead close to the said churchyard, and\nwhich for that very reason was left open, and is since, I suppose, taken\ninto the same churchyard. And they had also two other burying-places in\nSpittlefields, one where since a chapel or tabernacle has been built for\nease to this great parish, and another in Petticoat Lane.\n\nThere were no less than five other grounds made use of for the parish of\nStepney at that time: one where now stands the parish church of St Paul,\nShadwell, and the other where now stands the parish church of St John's\nat Wapping, both which had not the names of parishes at that time, but\nwere belonging to Stepney parish.\n\nI could name many more, but these coming within my particular knowledge,\nthe circumstance, I thought, made it of use to record them. From the\nwhole, it may be observed that they were obliged in this time of\ndistress to take in new burying-grounds in most of the out-parishes for\nlaying the prodigious numbers of people which died in so short a space\nof time; but why care was not taken to keep those places separate from\nordinary uses, that so the bodies might rest undisturbed, that I cannot\nanswer for, and must confess I think it was wrong. Who were to blame I\nknow not.\n\nI should have mentioned that the Quakers had at that time also a\nburying-ground set apart to their use, and which they still make use of;\nand they had also a particular dead-cart to fetch their dead from their\nhouses; and the famous Solomon Eagle, who, as I mentioned before, had\npredicted the plague as a judgement, and ran naked through the streets,\ntelling the people that it was come upon them to punish them for their\nsins, had his own wife died the very next day of the plague, and was\ncarried, one of the first in the Quakers' dead-cart, to their new\nburying-ground.\n\nI might have thronged this account with many more remarkable things\nwhich occurred in the time of the infection, and particularly what\npassed between the Lord Mayor and the Court, which was then at Oxford,\nand what directions were from time to time received from the Government\nfor their conduct on this critical occasion. But really the Court\nconcerned themselves so little, and that little they did was of so small\nimport, that I do not see it of much moment to mention any part of it\nhere: except that of appointing a monthly fast in the city and the\nsending the royal charity to the relief of the poor, both which I have\nmentioned before.\n\nGreat was the reproach thrown on those physicians who left their\npatients during the sickness, and now they came to town again nobody\ncared to employ them. They were called deserters, and frequently bills\nwere set up upon their doors and written, 'Here is a doctor to be let',\nso that several of those physicians were fain for a while to sit still\nand look about them, or at least remove their dwellings, and set up in\nnew places and among new acquaintance. The like was the case with the\nclergy, whom the people were indeed very abusive to, writing verses and\nscandalous reflections upon them, setting upon the church-door, 'Here is\na pulpit to be let', or sometimes, 'to be sold', which was worse.\n\nIt was not the least of our misfortunes that with our infection, when it\nceased, there did not cease the spirit of strife and contention, slander\nand reproach, which was really the great troubler of the nation's peace\nbefore. It was said to be the remains of the old animosities, which had\nso lately involved us all in blood and disorder. But as the late Act of\nIndemnity had laid asleep the quarrel itself, so the Government had\nrecommended family and personal peace upon all occasions to the whole\nnation.\n\nBut it could not be obtained; and particularly after the ceasing of the\nplague in London, when any one that had seen the condition which the\npeople had been in, and how they caressed one another at that time,\npromised to have more charity for the future, and to raise no more\nreproaches; I say, any one that had seen them then would have thought\nthey would have come together with another spirit at last. But, I say,\nit could not be obtained. The quarrel remained; the Church and the\nPresbyterians were incompatible. As soon as the plague was removed, the\nDissenting ousted ministers who had supplied the pulpits which were\ndeserted by the incumbents retired; they could expect no other but that\nthey should immediately fall upon them and harass them with their penal\nlaws, accept their preaching while they were sick, and persecute them as\nsoon as they were recovered again; this even we that were of the Church\nthought was very hard, and could by no means approve of it.\n\nBut it was the Government, and we could say nothing to hinder it; we\ncould only say it was not our doing, and we could not answer for it.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dissenters reproaching those ministers of the\nChurch with going away and deserting their charge, abandoning the people\nin their danger, and when they had most need of comfort, and the like:\nthis we could by no means approve, for all men have not the same faith\nand the same courage, and the Scripture commands us to judge the most\nfavourably and according to charity.\n\nA plague is a formidable enemy, and is armed with terrors that every man\nis not sufficiently fortified to resist or prepared to stand the shock\nagainst. It is very certain that a great many of the clergy who were in\ncircumstances to do it withdrew and fled for the safety of their lives;\nbut 'tis true also that a great many of them stayed, and many of them\nfell in the calamity and in the discharge of their duty.\n\nIt is true some of the Dissenting turned-out ministers stayed, and their\ncourage is to be commended and highly valued--but these were not\nabundance; it cannot be said that they all stayed, and that none retired\ninto the country, any more than it can be said of the Church clergy that\nthey all went away. Neither did all those that went away go without\nsubstituting curates and others in their places, to do the offices\nneedful and to visit the sick, as far as it was practicable; so that,\nupon the whole, an allowance of charity might have been made on both\nsides, and we should have considered that such a time as this of 1665 is\nnot to be paralleled in history, and that it is not the stoutest courage\nthat will always support men in such cases. I had not said this, but had\nrather chosen to record the courage and religious zeal of those of both\nsides, who did hazard themselves for the service of the poor people in\ntheir distress, without remembering that any failed in their duty on\neither side. But the want of temper among us has made the contrary to\nthis necessary: some that stayed not only boasting too much of\nthemselves, but reviling those that fled, branding them with cowardice,\ndeserting their flocks, and acting the part of the hireling, and the\nlike. I recommend it to the charity of all good people to look back and\nreflect duly upon the terrors of the time, and whoever does so will see\nthat it is not an ordinary strength that could support it. It was not\nlike appearing in the head of an army or charging a body of horse in the\nfield, but it was charging Death itself on his pale horse; to stay was\nindeed to die, and it could be esteemed nothing less, especially as\nthings appeared at the latter end of August and the beginning of\nSeptember, and as there was reason to expect them at that time; for no\nman expected, and I dare say believed, that the distemper would take so\nsudden a turn as it did, and fall immediately two thousand in a week,\nwhen there was such a prodigious number of people sick at that time as\nit was known there was; and then it was that many shifted away that had\nstayed most of the time before.\n\nBesides, if God gave strength to some more than to others, was it to\nboast of their ability to abide the stroke, and upbraid those that had\nnot the same gift and support, or ought not they rather to have been\nhumble and thankful if they were rendered more useful than their\nbrethren?\n\nI think it ought to be recorded to the honour of such men, as well\nclergy as physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, magistrates, and officers\nof every kind, as also all useful people who ventured their lives in\ndischarge of their duty, as most certainly all such as stayed did to the\nlast degree; and several of all these kinds did not only venture but\nlose their lives on that sad occasion.\n\nI was once making a list of all such, I mean of all those professions\nand employments who thus died, as I call it, in the way of their duty;\nbut it was impossible for a private man to come at a certainty in the\nparticulars. I only remember that there died sixteen clergymen, two\naldermen, five physicians, thirteen surgeons, within the city and\nliberties before the beginning of September. But this being, as I said\nbefore, the great crisis and extremity of the infection, it can be no\ncomplete list. As to inferior people, I think there died six-and-forty\nconstables and head-boroughs in the two parishes of Stepney and\nWhitechappel; but I could not carry my list on, for when the violent\nrage of the distemper in September came upon us, it drove us out of all\nmeasures. Men did then no more die by tale and by number. They might put\nout a weekly bill, and call them seven or eight thousand, or what they\npleased; 'tis certain they died by heaps, and were buried by heaps, that\nis to say, without account. And if I might believe some people, who were\nmore abroad and more conversant with those things than I though I was\npublic enough for one that had no more business to do than I had,--I\nsay, if I may believe them, there was not many less buried those first\nthree weeks in September than 20,000 per week. However, the others aver\nthe truth of it; yet I rather choose to keep to the public account;\nseven and eight thousand per week is enough to make good all that I have\nsaid of the terror of those times;--and it is much to the satisfaction\nof me that write, as well as those that read, to be able to say that\neverything is set down with moderation, and rather within compass than\nbeyond it.\n\nUpon all these accounts, I say, I could wish, when we were recovered,\nour conduct had been more distinguished for charity and kindness in\nremembrance of the past calamity, and not so much a valuing ourselves\nupon our boldness in staying, as if all men were cowards that fly from\nthe hand of God, or that those who stay do not sometimes owe their\ncourage to their ignorance, and despising the hand of their Maker--which\nis a criminal kind of desperation, and not a true courage.\n\nI cannot but leave it upon record that the civil officers, such as\nconstables, head-boroughs, Lord Mayor's and sheriffs'-men, as also\nparish officers, whose business it was to take charge of the poor, did\ntheir duties in general with as much courage as any, and perhaps with\nmore, because their work was attended with more hazards, and lay more\namong the poor, who were more subject to be infected, and in the most\npitiful plight when they were taken with the infection. But then it must\nbe added, too, that a great number of them died; indeed it was scarce\npossible it should be otherwise.\n\nI have not said one word here about the physic or preparations that we\nordinarily made use of on this terrible occasion--I mean we that went\nfrequently abroad and up down street, as I did; much of this was talked\nof in the books and bills of our quack doctors, of whom I have said\nenough already. It may, however, be added, that the College of\nPhysicians were daily publishing several preparations, which they had\nconsidered of in the process of their practice, and which, being to be\nhad in print, I avoid repeating them for that reason.\n\nOne thing I could not help observing: what befell one of the quacks, who\npublished that he had a most excellent preservative against the plague,\nwhich whoever kept about them should never be infected or liable to\ninfection. This man, who, we may reasonably suppose, did not go abroad\nwithout some of this excellent preservative in his pocket, yet was taken\nby the distemper, and carried off in two or three days.\n\nI am not of the number of the physic-haters or physic-despisers; on the\ncontrary, I have often mentioned the regard I had to the dictates of my\nparticular friend Dr Heath; but yet I must acknowledge I made use of\nlittle or nothing--except, as I have observed, to keep a preparation of\nstrong scent to have ready, in case I met with anything of offensive\nsmells or went too near any burying-place or dead body.\n\nNeither did I do what I know some did: keep the spirits always high and\nhot with cordials and wine and such things; and which, as I observed,\none learned physician used himself so much to as that he could not leave\nthem off when the infection was quite gone, and so became a sot for all\nhis life after.\n\nI remember my friend the doctor used to say that there was a certain set\nof drugs and preparations which were all certainly good and useful in\nthe case of an infection; out of which, or with which, physicians might\nmake an infinite variety of medicines, as the ringers of bells make\nseveral hundred different rounds of music by the changing and order or\nsound but in six bells, and that all these preparations shall be really\nvery good: 'Therefore,' said he, 'I do not wonder that so vast a throng\nof medicines is offered in the present calamity, and almost every\nphysician prescribes or prepares a different thing, as his judgement or\nexperience guides him; but', says my friend, 'let all the prescriptions\nof all the physicians in London be examined, and it will be found that\nthey are all compounded of the same things, with such variations only as\nthe particular fancy of the doctor leads him to; so that', says he,\n'every man, judging a little of his own constitution and manner of his\nliving, and circumstances of his being infected, may direct his own\nmedicines out of the ordinary drugs and preparations. Only that', says\nhe, 'some recommend one thing as most sovereign, and some another.\nSome', says he, 'think that pill. ruff., which is called itself the\nanti-pestilential pill is the best preparation that can be made; others\nthink that Venice treacle is sufficient of itself to resist the\ncontagion; and I', says he, 'think as both these think, viz., that the\nlast is good to take beforehand to prevent it, and the first, if\ntouched, to expel it.' According to this opinion, I several times took\nVenice treacle, and a sound sweat upon it, and thought myself as well\nfortified against the infection as any one could be fortified by the\npower of physic.\n\nAs for quackery and mountebanks, of which the town was so full, I\nlistened to none of them, and have observed often since, with some\nwonder, that for two years after the plague I scarcely saw or heard of\none of them about town. Some fancied they were all swept away in the\ninfection to a man, and were for calling it a particular mark of God's\nvengeance upon them for leading the poor people into the pit of\ndestruction, merely for the lucre of a little money they got by them;\nbut I cannot go that length neither. That abundance of them died is\ncertain--many of them came within the reach of my own knowledge--but\nthat all of them were swept off I much question. I believe rather they\nfled into the country and tried their practices upon the people there,\nwho were in apprehension of the infection before it came among them.\n\nThis, however, is certain, not a man of them appeared for a great while\nin or about London. There were, indeed, several doctors who published\nbills recommending their several physical preparations for cleansing the\nbody, as they call it, after the plague, and needful, as they said, for\nsuch people to take who had been visited and had been cured; whereas I\nmust own I believe that it was the opinion of the most eminent\nphysicians at that time that the plague was itself a sufficient purge,\nand that those who escaped the infection needed no physic to cleanse\ntheir bodies of any other things; the running sores, the tumours, &c.,\nwhich were broke and kept open by the directions of the physicians,\nhaving sufficiently cleansed them; and that all other distempers, and\ncauses of distempers, were effectually carried off that way; and as the\nphysicians gave this as their opinions wherever they came, the quacks\ngot little business.\n\nThere were, indeed, several little hurries which happened after the\ndecrease of the plague, and which, whether they were contrived to fright\nand disorder the people, as some imagined, I cannot say, but sometimes\nwe were told the plague would return by such a time; and the famous\nSolomon Eagle, the naked Quaker I have mentioned, prophesied evil\ntidings every day; and several others telling us that London had not\nbeen sufficiently scourged, and that sorer and severer strokes were yet\nbehind. Had they stopped there, or had they descended to particulars,\nand told us that the city should the next year be destroyed by fire,\nthen, indeed, when we had seen it come to pass, we should not have been\nto blame to have paid more than a common respect to their prophetic\nspirits; at least we should have wondered at them, and have been more\nserious in our inquiries after the meaning of it, and whence they had\nthe foreknowledge. But as they generally told us of a relapse into the\nplague, we have had no concern since that about them; yet by those\nfrequent clamours, we were all kept with some kind of apprehensions\nconstantly upon us; and if any died suddenly, or if the spotted fevers\nat any time increased, we were presently alarmed; much more if the\nnumber of the plague increased, for to the end of the year there were\nalways between 200 and 300 of the plague. On any of these occasions, I\nsay, we were alarmed anew.\n\nThose who remember the city of London before the fire must remember that\nthere was then no such place as we now call Newgate Market, but that in\nthe middle of the street which is now called Blowbladder Street, and\nwhich had its name from the butchers, who used to kill and dress their\nsheep there (and who, it seems, had a custom to blow up their meat with\npipes to make it look thicker and fatter than it was, and were punished\nthere for it by the Lord Mayor); I say, from the end of the street\ntowards Newgate there stood two long rows of shambles for the selling\nmeat.\n\nIt was in those shambles that two persons falling down dead, as they\nwere buying meat, gave rise to a rumour that the meat was all infected;\nwhich, though it might affright the people, and spoiled the market for\ntwo or three days, yet it appeared plainly afterwards that there was\nnothing of truth in the suggestion. But nobody can account for the\npossession of fear when it takes hold of the mind.\n\nHowever, it Pleased God, by the continuing of the winter weather, so to\nrestore the health of the city that by February following we reckoned\nthe distemper quite ceased, and then we were not so easily frighted\nagain.\n\nThere was still a question among the learned, and at first perplexed the\npeople a little: and that was in what manner to purge the house and\ngoods where the plague had been, and how to render them habitable again,\nwhich had been left empty during the time of the plague. Abundance of\nperfumes and preparations were prescribed by physicians, some of one\nkind and some of another, in which the people who listened to them put\nthemselves to a great, and indeed, in my opinion, to an unnecessary\nexpense; and the poorer people, who only set open their windows night\nand day, burned brimstone, pitch, and gunpowder, and such things in\ntheir rooms, did as well as the best; nay, the eager people who, as I\nsaid above, came home in haste and at all hazards, found little or no\ninconvenience in their houses, nor in the goods, and did little or\nnothing to them.\n\nHowever, in general, prudent, cautious people did enter into some\nmeasures for airing and sweetening their houses, and burned perfumes,\nincense, benjamin, rozin, and sulphur in their rooms close shut up, and\nthen let the air carry it all out with a blast of gunpowder; others\ncaused large fires to be made all day and all night for several days and\nnights; by the same token that two or three were pleased to set their\nhouses on fire, and so effectually sweetened them by burning them down\nto the ground; as particularly one at Ratcliff, one in Holbourn, and one\nat Westminster; besides two or three that were set on fire, but the fire\nwas happily got out again before it went far enough to burn down the\nhouses; and one citizen's servant, I think it was in Thames Street,\ncarried so much gunpowder into his master's house, for clearing it of\nthe infection, and managed it so foolishly, that he blew up part of the\nroof of the house. But the time was not fully come that the city was to\nbe purged by fire, nor was it far off; for within nine months more I saw\nit all lying in ashes; when, as some of our quacking philosophers\npretend, the seeds of the plague were entirely destroyed, and not\nbefore; a notion too ridiculous to speak of here: since, had the seeds\nof the plague remained in the houses, not to be destroyed but by fire,\nhow has it been that they have not since broken out, seeing all those\nbuildings in the suburbs and liberties, all in the great parishes of\nStepney, Whitechappel, Aldgate, Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Cripplegate,\nand St Giles, where the fire never came, and where the plague raged with\nthe greatest violence, remain still in the same condition they were in\nbefore?\n\nBut to leave these things just as I found them, it was certain that\nthose people who were more than ordinarily cautious of their health, did\ntake particular directions for what they called seasoning of their\nhouses, and abundance of costly things were consumed on that account\nwhich I cannot but say not only seasoned those houses, as they desired,\nbut filled the air with very grateful and wholesome smells which others\nhad the share of the benefit of as well as those who were at the\nexpenses of them.\n\nAnd yet after all, though the poor came to town very precipitantly, as I\nhave said, yet I must say the rich made no such haste. The men of\nbusiness, indeed, came up, but many of them did not bring their families\nto town till the spring came on, and that they saw reason to depend upon\nit that the plague would not return.\n\nThe Court, indeed, came up soon after Christmas, but the nobility and\ngentry, except such as depended upon and had employment under the\nadministration, did not come so soon.\n\nI should have taken notice here that, notwithstanding the violence of\nthe plague in London and in other places, yet it was very observable\nthat it was never on board the fleet; and yet for some time there was a\nstrange press in the river, and even in the streets, for seamen to man\nthe fleet. But it was in the beginning of the year, when the plague was\nscarce begun, and not at all come down to that part of the city where\nthey usually press for seamen; and though a war with the Dutch was not\nat all grateful to the people at that time, and the seamen went with a\nkind of reluctancy into the service, and many complained of being\ndragged into it by force, yet it proved in the event a happy violence to\nseveral of them, who had probably perished in the general calamity, and\nwho, after the summer service was over, though they had cause to lament\nthe desolation of their families--who, when they came back, were many of\nthem in their graves--yet they had room to be thankful that they were\ncarried out of the reach of it, though so much against their wills. We\nindeed had a hot war with the Dutch that year, and one very great\nengagement at sea in which the Dutch were worsted, but we lost a great\nmany men and some ships. But, as I observed, the plague was not in the\nfleet, and when they came to lay up the ships in the river the violent\npart of it began to abate.\n\nI would be glad if I could close the account of this melancholy year\nwith some particular examples historically; I mean of the thankfulness\nto God, our preserver, for our being delivered from this dreadful\ncalamity. Certainly the circumstance of the deliverance, as well as the\nterrible enemy we were delivered from, called upon the whole nation for\nit. The circumstances of the deliverance were indeed very remarkable, as\nI have in part mentioned already, and particularly the dreadful\ncondition which we were all in when we were to the surprise of the whole\ntown made joyful with the hope of a stop of the infection.\n\nNothing but the immediate finger of God, nothing but omnipotent power,\ncould have done it. The contagion despised all medicine; death raged in\nevery corner; and had it gone on as it did then, a few weeks more would\nhave cleared the town of all, and everything that had a soul. Men\neverywhere began to despair; every heart failed them for fear; people\nwere made desperate through the anguish of their souls, and the terrors\nof death sat in the very faces and countenances of the people.\n\nIn that very moment when we might very well say, 'Vain was the help of\nman',--I say, in that very moment it pleased God, with a most agreeable\nsurprise, to cause the fury of it to abate, even of itself; and the\nmalignity declining, as I have said, though infinite numbers were sick,\nyet fewer died, and the very first weeks' bill decreased 1843; a vast\nnumber indeed!\n\nIt is impossible to express the change that appeared in the very\ncountenances of the people that Thursday morning when the weekly bill\ncame out. It might have been perceived in their countenances that a\nsecret surprise and smile of joy sat on everybody's face. They shook one\nanother by the hands in the streets, who would hardly go on the same\nside of the way with one another before. Where the streets were not too\nbroad they would open their windows and call from one house to another,\nand ask how they did, and if they had heard the good news that the\nplague was abated. Some would return, when they said good news, and ask,\n'What good news?' and when they answered that the plague was abated and\nthe bills decreased almost two thousand, they would cry out, 'God be\npraised!' and would weep aloud for joy, telling them they had heard\nnothing of it; and such was the joy of the people that it was, as it\nwere, life to them from the grave. I could almost set down as many\nextravagant things done in the excess of their joy as of their grief;\nbut that would be to lessen the value of it.\n\nI must confess myself to have been very much dejected just before this\nhappened; for the prodigious number that were taken sick the week or two\nbefore, besides those that died, was such, and the lamentations were so\ngreat everywhere, that a man must have seemed to have acted even against\nhis reason if he had so much as expected to escape; and as there was\nhardly a house but mine in all my neighbourhood but was infected, so had\nit gone on it would not have been long that there would have been any\nmore neighbours to be infected. Indeed it is hardly credible what\ndreadful havoc the last three weeks had made, for if I might believe the\nperson whose calculations I always found very well grounded, there were\nnot less than 30,000 people dead and near 100.000 fallen sick in the\nthree weeks I speak of; for the number that sickened was surprising,\nindeed it was astonishing, and those whose courage upheld them all the\ntime before, sank under it now.\n\nIn the middle of their distress, when the condition of the city of\nLondon was so truly calamitous, just then it pleased God--as it were by\nHis immediate hand to disarm this enemy; the poison was taken out of the\nsting. It was wonderful; even the physicians themselves were surprised\nat it. Wherever they visited they found their patients better; either\nthey had sweated kindly, or the tumours were broke, or the carbuncles\nwent down and the inflammations round them changed colour, or the fever\nwas gone, or the violent headache was assuaged, or some good symptom was\nin the case; so that in a few days everybody was recovering, whole\nfamilies that were infected and down, that had ministers praying with\nthem, and expected death every hour, were revived and healed, and none\ndied at all out of them.\n\nNor was this by any new medicine found out, or new method of cure\ndiscovered, or by any experience in the operation which the physicians\nor surgeons attained to; but it was evidently from the secret invisible\nhand of Him that had at first sent this disease as a judgement upon us;\nand let the atheistic part of mankind call my saying what they please,\nit is no enthusiasm; it was acknowledged at that time by all mankind.\nThe disease was enervated and its malignity spent; and let it proceed\nfrom whencesoever it will, let the philosophers search for reasons in\nnature to account for it by, and labour as much as they will to lessen\nthe debt they owe to their Maker, those physicians who had the least\nshare of religion in them were obliged to acknowledge that it was all\nsupernatural, that it was extraordinary, and that no account could be\ngiven of it.\n\nIf I should say that this is a visible summons to us all to\nthankfulness, especially we that were under the terror of its increase,\nperhaps it may be thought by some, after the sense of the thing was\nover, an officious canting of religious things, preaching a sermon\ninstead of writing a history, making myself a teacher instead of giving\nmy observations of things; and this restrains me very much from going on\nhere as I might otherwise do. But if ten lepers were healed, and but one\nreturned to give thanks, I desire to be as that one, and to be thankful\nfor myself.\n\nNor will I deny but there were abundance of people who, to all\nappearance, were very thankful at that time; for their mouths were\nstopped, even the mouths of those whose hearts were not extraordinary\nlong affected with it. But the impression was so strong at that time\nthat it could not be resisted; no, not by the worst of the people.\n\nIt was a common thing to meet people in the street that were strangers,\nand that we knew nothing at all of, expressing their surprise. Going one\nday through Aldgate, and a pretty many people being passing and\nrepassing, there comes a man out of the end of the Minories, and looking\na little up the street and down, he throws his hands abroad, 'Lord, what\nan alteration is here! Why, last week I came along here, and hardly\nanybody was to be seen.' Another man--I heard him--adds to his words,\n''Tis all wonderful; 'tis all a dream.' 'Blessed be God,' says a third\nman, and and let us give thanks to Him, for 'tis all His own doing,\nhuman help and human skill was at an end.' These were all strangers to\none another. But such salutations as these were frequent in the street\nevery day; and in spite of a loose behaviour, the very common people\nwent along the streets giving God thanks for their deliverance.\n\nIt was now, as I said before, the people had cast off all apprehensions,\nand that too fast; indeed we were no more afraid now to pass by a man\nwith a white cap upon his head, or with a cloth wrapt round his neck, or\nwith his leg limping, occasioned by the sores in his groin, all which\nwere frightful to the last degree, but the week before. But now the\nstreet was full of them, and these poor recovering creatures, give them\ntheir due, appeared very sensible of their unexpected deliverance; and I\nshould wrong them very much if I should not acknowledge that I believe\nmany of them were really thankful. But I must own that, for the\ngenerality of the people, it might too justly be said of them as was\nsaid of the children of Israel after their being delivered from the host\nof Pharaoh, when they passed the Red Sea, and looked back and saw the\nEgyptians overwhelmed in the water: viz., that they sang His praise, but\nthey soon forgot His works.\n\nI can go no farther here. I should be counted censorious, and perhaps\nunjust, if I should enter into the unpleasing work of reflecting,\nwhatever cause there was for it, upon the unthankfulness and return of\nall manner of wickedness among us, which I was so much an eye-witness of\nmyself. I shall conclude the account of this calamitous year therefore\nwith a coarse but sincere stanza of my own, which I placed at the end of\nmy ordinary memorandums the same year they were written:--\n\n\n     A dreadful plague in London was\n     In the year sixty-five,\n     Which swept an hundred thousand souls\n     Away; yet I alive!\n\n     H.
