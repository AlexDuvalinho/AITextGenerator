I'm\nsure you won't mind.  I would ask one of the debutantes, except that\nthey're always so cross if one puts them next to men they don't know\nand who can't help them, and so I thought I'd just ask you, you're so\ngood-natured.  You don't mind, do you?\"\n\n\"I mind being called good-natured,\" said Miss Langham, smiling. \"Mind\nwhat, Mrs. Porter?\" she asked.\n\n\"He is a friend of George's,\" Mrs. Porter explained, vaguely. \"He's a\ncowboy.  It seems he was very civil to George when he was out there\nshooting in New Mexico, or Old Mexico, I don't remember which.  He took\nGeorge to his hut and gave him things to shoot, and all that, and now\nhe is in New York with a letter of introduction.  It's just like\nGeorge.  He may be a most impossible sort of man, but, as I said to Mr.\nPorter, the people I've asked can't complain, because I don't know\nanything more about him than they do.  He called to-day when I was out\nand left his card and George's letter of introduction, and as a man had\nfailed me for to-night, I just thought I would kill two birds with one\nstone, and ask him to fill his place, and he's here. And, oh, yes,\"\nMrs. Porter added, \"I'm going to put him next to you, do you mind?\"\n\n\"Unless he wears leather leggings and long spurs I shall mind very\nmuch,\" said Miss Langham.\n\n\"Well, that's very nice of you,\" purred Mrs. Porter, as she moved away.\n\"He may not be so bad, after all; and I'll put Reginald King on your\nother side, shall I?\" she asked, pausing and glancing back.\n\nThe look on Miss Langham's face, which had been one of amusement,\nchanged consciously, and she smiled with polite acquiescence.\n\n\"As you please, Mrs. Porter,\" she answered.  She raised her eyebrows\nslightly.  \"I am, as the politicians say, 'in the hands of my friends.'\"\n\n\"Entirely too much in the hands of my friends,\" she repeated, as she\nturned away.  This was the twelfth time during that same winter that\nshe and Mr. King had been placed next to one another at dinner, and it\nhad passed beyond the point when she could say that it did not matter\nwhat people thought as long as she and he understood.  It had now\nreached that stage when she was not quite sure that she understood\neither him or herself.  They had known each other for a very long time;\ntoo long, she sometimes thought, for them ever to grow to know each\nother any better. But there was always the chance that he had another\nside, one that had not disclosed itself, and which she could not\ndiscover in the strict social environment in which they both lived.\nAnd she was the surer of this because she had once seen him when he did\nnot know that she was near, and he had been so different that it had\npuzzled her and made her wonder if she knew the real Reggie King at all.\n\nIt was at a dance at a studio, and some French pantomimists gave a\nlittle play.  When it was over, King sat in the corner talking to one\nof the Frenchwomen, and while he waited on her he was laughing at her\nand at her efforts to speak English.  He was telling her how to say\ncertain phrases and not telling her correctly, and she suspected this\nand was accusing him of it, and they were rhapsodizing and exclaiming\nover certain delightful places and dishes of which they both knew in\nParis with the enthusiasm of two children.  Miss Langham saw him off\nhis guard for the first time and instead of a somewhat bored and clever\nman of the world, he appeared as sincere and interested as a boy.\n\nWhen he joined her, later, the same evening, he was as entertaining as\nusual, and as polite and attentive as he had been to the Frenchwoman,\nbut he was not greatly interested, and his laugh was modulated and not\nspontaneous.  She had wondered that night, and frequently since then,\nif, in the event of his asking her to marry him, which was possible,\nand of her accepting him, which was also possible, whether she would\nfind him, in the closer knowledge of married life, as keen and\nlighthearted with her as he had been with the French dancer.  If he\nwould but treat her more like a comrade and equal, and less like a\nprime minister conferring with his queen!  She wanted something more\nintimate than the deference that he showed her, and she did not like\nhis taking it as an accepted fact that she was as worldly-wise as\nhimself, even though it were true.\n\nShe was a woman and wanted to be loved, in spite of the fact that she\nhad been loved by many men--at least it was so supposed--and had\nrejected them.\n\nEach had offered her position, or had wanted her because she was fitted\nto match his own great state, or because he was ambitious, or because\nshe was rich.  The man who could love her as she once believed men\ncould love, and who could give her something else besides approval of\nher beauty and her mind, had not disclosed himself.  She had begun to\nthink that he never would, that he did not exist, that he was an\nimagination of the playhouse and the novel.  The men whom she knew were\ncareful to show her that they appreciated how distinguished was her\nposition, and how inaccessible she was to them.  They seemed to think\nthat by so humbling themselves, and by emphasizing her position they\npleased her best, when it was what she wanted them to forget.  Each of\nthem would draw away backward, bowing and protesting that he was\nunworthy to raise his eyes to such a prize, but that if she would only\nstoop to him, how happy his life would be.  Sometimes they meant it\nsincerely; sometimes they were gentlemanly adventurers of title, from\nwhom it was a business proposition, and in either case she turned\nrestlessly away and asked herself how long it would be before the man\nwould come who would pick her up on his saddle and gallop off with her,\nwith his arm around her waist and his horse's hoofs clattering beneath\nthem, and echoing the tumult in their hearts.\n\nShe had known too many great people in the world to feel impressed with\nher own position at home in America; but she sometimes compared herself\nto the Queen in \"In a Balcony,\" and repeated to herself, with mock\nseriousness:--\n\n    \"And you the marble statue all the time\n      They praise and point at as preferred to life,\n      Yet leave for the first breathing woman's cheek,\n      First dancer's, gypsy's or street balladine's!\"\n\nAnd if it were true, she asked herself, that the man she had imagined\nwas only an ideal and an illusion, was not King the best of the others,\nthe unideal and ever-present others?  Every one else seemed to think\nso.  The society they knew put them constantly together and approved.\nHer people approved.  Her own mind approved, and as her heart was not\napparently ever to be considered, who could say that it did not approve\nas well?  He was certainly a very charming fellow, a manly, clever\ncompanion, and one who bore about him the evidences of distinction and\nthorough breeding.  As far as family went, the Kings were as old as a\nyoung country could expect, and Reggie King was, moreover, in spite of\nhis wealth, a man of action and ability.  His yacht journeyed from\ncontinent to continent, and not merely up the Sound to Newport, and he\nwas as well known and welcome to the consuls along the coasts of Africa\nand South America as he was at Cowes or Nice.  His books of voyages\nwere recognized by geographical societies and other serious bodies, who\nhad given him permission to put long disarrangements of the alphabet\nafter his name.  She liked him because she had grown to be at home with\nhim, because it was good to know that there was some one who would not\nmisunderstand her, and who, should she so indulge herself, would not\ntake advantage of any appeal she might make to his sympathy, who would\nalways be sure to do the tactful thing and the courteous thing, and\nwho, while he might never do a great thing, could not do an unkind one.\n\nMiss Langham had entered the Porters' drawing-room after the greater\nnumber of the guests had arrived, and she turned from her hostess to\nlisten to an old gentleman with a passion for golf, a passion in which\nhe had for a long time been endeavoring to interest her.  She answered\nhim and his enthusiasm in kind, and with as much apparent interest as\nshe would have shown in a matter of state.  It was her principle to be\nall things to all men, whether they were great artists, great\ndiplomats, or great bores.  If a man had been pleading with her to\nleave the conservatory and run away with him, and another had come up\ninnocently and announced that it was his dance, she would have said:\n\"Oh, is it?\" with as much apparent delight as though his coming had\nbeen the one bright hope in her life.\n\nShe was growing enthusiastic over the delights of golf and\nunconsciously making a very beautiful picture of herself in her\ninterest and forced vivacity, when she became conscious for the first\ntime of a strange young man who was standing alone before the fireplace\nlooking at her, and frankly listening to all the nonsense she was\ntalking.  She guessed that he had been listening for some time, and she\nalso saw, before he turned his eyes quickly away, that he was\ndistinctly amused.  Miss Langham stopped gesticulating and lowered her\nvoice, but continued to keep her eyes on the face of the stranger,\nwhose own eyes were wandering around the room, to give her, so she\nguessed, the idea that he had not been listening, but that she had\ncaught him at it in the moment he had first looked at her.  He was a\ntall, broad-shouldered youth, with a handsome face, tanned and dyed,\neither by the sun or by exposure to the wind, to a deep ruddy brown,\nwhich contrasted strangely with his yellow hair and mustache, and with\nthe pallor of the other faces about him.  He was a stranger apparently\nto every one present, and his bearing suggested, in consequence, that\nease of manner which comes to a person who is not only sure of himself,\nbut who has no knowledge of the claims and pretensions to social\ndistinction of those about him.  His most attractive feature was his\neyes, which seemed to observe all that was going on, not only what was\non the surface, but beneath the surface, and that not rudely or\ncovertly but with the frank, quick look of the trained observer.  Miss\nLangham found it an interesting face to watch, and she did not look\naway from it. She was acquainted with every one else in the room, and\nhence she knew this must be the cowboy of whom Mrs. Porter had spoken,\nand she wondered how any one who had lived the rough life of the West\ncould still retain the look when in formal clothes of one who was in\nthe habit of doing informal things in them.\n\nMrs. Porter presented her cowboy simply as \"Mr. Clay, of whom I spoke\nto you,\" with a significant raising of the eyebrows, and the cowboy\nmade way for King, who took Miss Langham in.  He looked frankly\npleased, however, when he found himself next to her again, but did not\ntake advantage of it throughout the first part of the dinner, during\nwhich time he talked to the young married woman on his right, and Miss\nLangham and King continued where they had left off at their last\nmeeting.  They knew each other well enough to joke of the way in which\nthey were thrown into each other's society, and, as she said, they\ntried to make the best of it.  But while she spoke, Miss Langham was\ncontinually conscious of the presence of her neighbor, who piqued her\ninterest and her curiosity in different ways.  He seemed to be at his\nease, and yet from the manner in which he glanced up and down the table\nand listened to snatches of talk on either side of him he had the\nappearance of one to whom it was all new, and who was seeing it for the\nfirst time.\n\nThere was a jolly group at one end of the long table, and they wished\nto emphasize the fact by laughing a little more hysterically at their\nremarks than the humor of those witticisms seemed to justify.  A\ndaughter-in-law of Mrs. Porter was their leader in this, and at one\npoint she stopped in the middle of a story and waving her hand at the\ndouble row of faces turned in her direction, which had been attracted\nby the loudness of her voice, cried, gayly, \"Don't listen.  This is for\nprivate circulation.  It is not a jeune-fille story.\"  The debutantes\nat the table continued talking again in steady, even tones, as though\nthey had not heard the remark or the first of the story, and the men\nnext to them appeared equally unconscious.  But the cowboy, Miss\nLangham noted out of the corner of her eye, after a look of polite\nsurprise, beamed with amusement and continued to stare up and down the\ntable as though he had discovered a new trait in a peculiar and\ninteresting animal.  For some reason, she could not tell why, she felt\nannoyed with herself and with her friends, and resented the attitude\nwhich the new-comer assumed toward them.\n\n\"Mrs. Porter tells me that you know her son George?\" she said. He did\nnot answer her at once, but bowed his head in assent, with a look of\ninterrogation, as though, so it seemed to her, he had expected her,\nwhen she did speak, to say something less conventional.\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, after a pause, \"he joined us at Ayutla.  It was the\nterminus of the Jalisco and Mexican Railroad then.  He came out over\nthe road and went in from there with an outfit after mountain lions.  I\nbelieve he had very good sport.\"\n\n\"That is a very wonderful road, I am told,\" said King, bending forward\nand introducing himself into the conversation with a nod of the head\ntoward Clay; \"quite a remarkable feat of engineering.\"\n\n\"It will open up the country, I believe,\" assented the other,\nindifferently.\n\n\"I know something of it,\" continued King, \"because I met the men who\nwere putting it through at Pariqua, when we touched there in the yacht.\nThey shipped most of their plant to that port, and we saw a good deal\nof them.  They were a very jolly lot, and they gave me a most\ninteresting account of their work and its difficulties.\"\n\nClay was looking at the other closely, as though he was trying to find\nsomething back of what he was saying, but as his glance seemed only to\nembarrass King he smiled freely again in assent, and gave him his full\nattention.\n\n\"There are no men to-day, Miss Langham,\" King exclaimed, suddenly,\nturning toward her, \"to my mind, who lead as picturesque lives as do\ncivil engineers.  And there are no men whose work is as little\nappreciated.\"\n\n\"Really?\" said Miss Langham, encouragingly.\n\n\"Now those men I met,\" continued King, settling himself with his side\nto the table, \"were all young fellows of thirty or thereabouts, but\nthey were leading the lives of pioneers and martyrs--at least that's\nwhat I'd call it.  They were marching through an almost unknown part of\nMexico, fighting Nature at every step and carrying civilization with\nthem.  They were doing better work than soldiers, because soldiers\ndestroy things, and these chaps were creating, and making the way\nstraight.  They had no banners either, nor brass bands.  They fought\nmountains and rivers, and they were attacked on every side by fever and\nthe lack of food and severe exposure.  They had to sit down around a\ncamp-fire at night and calculate whether they were to tunnel a\nmountain, or turn the bed of a river or bridge it.  And they knew all\nthe time that whatever they decided to do out there in the wilderness\nmeant thousands of dollars to the stockholders somewhere up in God's\ncountry, who would some day hold them to account for them.  They\ndragged their chains through miles and miles of jungle, and over flat\nalkali beds and cactus, and they reared bridges across roaring canons.\nWe know nothing about them and we care less.  When their work is done\nwe ride over the road in an observation-car and look down thousands and\nthousands of feet into the depths they have bridged, and we never give\nthem a thought.  They are the bravest soldiers of the present day, and\nthey are the least recognized.  I have forgotten their names, and you\nnever heard them.  But it seems to me the civil engineer, for all that,\nis the chief civilizer of our century.\"\n\nMiss Langham was looking ahead of her with her eyes half-closed, as\nthough she were going over in her mind the situation King had described.\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" she said.  \"It sounds very fine. As you say,\nthe reward is so inglorious.  But that is what makes it fine.\"\n\nThe cowboy was looking down at the table and pulling at a flower in the\ncentre-piece.  He had ceased to smile.  Miss Langham turned on him\nsomewhat sharply, resenting his silence, and said, with a slight\nchallenge in her voice:--\n\n\"Do you agree, Mr. Clay,\" she asked, \"or do you prefer the\nchocolate-cream soldiers, in red coats and gold lace?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" the young man answered, with some slight\nhesitation.  \"It's a trade for each of them.  The engineer's work is\nall the more absorbing, I imagine, when the difficulties are greatest.\nHe has the fun of overcoming them.\"\n\n\"You see nothing in it then,\" she asked, \"but a source of amusement?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, a good deal more,\" he replied.  \"A livelihood, for one thing.\nI--I have been an engineer all my life.  I built that road Mr. King is\ntalking about.\"\n\n\nAn hour later, when Mrs. Porter made the move to go, Miss Langham rose\nwith a protesting sigh.  \"I am so sorry,\" she said, \"it has been most\ninteresting.  I never met two men who had visited so many inaccessible\nplaces and come out whole.  You have quite inspired Mr. King, he was\nnever so amusing.  But I should like to hear the end of that adventure;\nwon't you tell it to me in the other room?\"\n\nClay bowed.  \"If I haven't thought of something more interesting in the\nmeantime,\" he said.\n\n\"What I can't understand,\" said King, as he moved up into Miss\nLangham's place, \"is how you had time to learn so much of the rest of\nthe world.  You don't act like a man who had spent his life in the\nbrush.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" asked Clay, smiling--\"that I don't use the wrong\nforks?\"\n\n\"No,\" laughed King, \"but you told us that this was your first visit\nEast, and yet you're talking about England and Vienna and Voisin's.\nHow is it you've been there, while you have never been in New York?\"\n\n\"Well, that's partly due to accident and partly to design,\" Clay\nanswered.  \"You see I've worked for English and German and French\ncompanies, as well as for those in the States, and I go abroad to make\nreports and to receive instructions.  And then I'm what you call a\nself-made man; that is, I've never been to college.  I've always had to\neducate myself, and whenever I did get a holiday it seemed to me that I\nought to put it to the best advantage, and to spend it where\ncivilization was the furthest advanced--advanced, at least, in years.\nWhen I settle down and become an expert, and demand large sums for just\nlooking at the work other fellows have done, then I hope to live in New\nYork, but until then I go where the art galleries are biggest and where\nthey have got the science of enjoying themselves down to the very\nfinest point.  I have enough rough work eight months of the year to\nmake me appreciate that.  So whenever I get a few months to myself I\ntake the Royal Mail to London, and from there to Paris or Vienna.  I\nthink I like Vienna the best.  The directors are generally important\npeople in their own cities, and they ask one about, and so, though I\nhope I am a good American, it happens that I've more friends on the\nContinent than in the United States.\"\n\n\"And how does this strike you?\" asked King, with a movement of his\nshoulder toward the men about the dismantled table.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" laughed Clay.  \"You've lived abroad yourself; how\ndoes it strike you?\"\n\nClay was the first man to enter the drawing-room.  He walked directly\naway from the others and over to Miss Langham, and, taking her fan out\nof her hands as though to assure himself of some hold upon her, seated\nhimself with his back to every one else.\n\n\"You have come to finish that story?\" she said, smiling.\n\nMiss Langham was a careful young person, and would not have encouraged\na man she knew even as well as she knew King, to talk to her through\ndinner, and after it as well.  She fully recognized that because she\nwas conspicuous certain innocent pleasures were denied her which other\ngirls could enjoy without attracting attention or comment.  But Clay\ninterested her beyond her usual self, and the look in his eyes was a\ntribute which she had no wish to put away from her.\n\n\"I've thought of something more interesting to talk about,\" said Clay.\n\"I'm going to talk about you.  You see I've known you a long time.\"\n\n\"Since eight o'clock?\" asked Miss Langham.\n\n\"Oh, no, since your coming out, four years ago.\"\n\n\"It's not polite to remember so far back,\" she said.  \"Were you one of\nthose who assisted at that important function?  There were so many\nthere I don't remember.\"\n\n\"No, I only read about it.  I remember it very well; I had ridden over\ntwelve miles for the mail that day, and I stopped half-way back to the\nranch and camped out in the shade of a rock and read all the papers and\nmagazines through at one sitting, until the sun went down and I\ncouldn't see the print.  One of the papers had an account of your\ncoming out in it, and a picture of you, and I wrote East to the\nphotographer for the original.  It knocked about the West for three\nmonths and then reached me at Laredo, on the border between Texas and\nMexico, and I have had it with me ever since.\"\n\nMiss Langham looked at Clay for a moment in silent dismay and with a\nperplexed smile.\n\n\"Where is it now?\" she asked at last.\n\n\"In my trunk at the hotel.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said, slowly.  She was still in doubt as to how to treat this\nact of unconventionality.  \"Not in your watch?\" she said, to cover up\nthe pause.  \"That would have been more in keeping with the rest of the\nstory.\"\n\nThe young man smiled grimly, and pulling out his watch pried back the\nlid and turned it to her so that she could see a photograph inside.\nThe face in the watch was that of a young girl in the dress of a\nfashion of several years ago.  It was a lovely, frank face, looking out\nof the picture into the world kindly and questioningly, and without\nfear.\n\n\"Was I once like that?\" she said, lightly.  \"Well, go on.\"\n\n\"Well,\" he said, with a little sigh of relief, \"I became greatly\ninterested in Miss Alice Langham, and in her comings out and goings in,\nand in her gowns.  Thanks to our having a press in the States that\nmakes a specialty of personalities, I was able to follow you pretty\nclosely, for, wherever I go, I have my papers sent after me.  I can get\nalong without a compass or a medicine-chest, but I can't do without the\nnewspapers and the magazines. There was a time when I thought you were\ngoing to marry that Austrian chap, and I didn't approve of that.  I\nknew things about him in Vienna.  And then I read of your engagement to\nothers--well--several others; some of them I thought worthy, and others\nnot.  Once I even thought of writing you about it, and once I saw you\nin Paris.  You were passing on a coach.  The man with me told me it was\nyou, and I wanted to follow the coach in a fiacre, but he said he knew\nat what hotel you were stopping, and so I let you go, but you were not\nat that hotel, or at any other--at least, I couldn't find you.\"\n\n\"What would you have done--?\" asked Miss Langham.  \"Never mind,\" she\ninterrupted, \"go on.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all,\" said Clay, smiling.  \"That's all, at least, that\nconcerns you.  That is the romance of this poor young man.\"\n\n\"But not the only one,\" she said, for the sake of saying something.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" answered Clay, \"but the only one that counts. I always\nknew I was going to meet you some day.  And now I have met you.\"\n\n\"Well, and now that you have met me,\" said Miss Langham, looking at him\nin some amusement, \"are you sorry?\"\n\n\"No--\" said Clay, but so slowly and with such consideration that Miss\nLangham laughed and held her head a little higher. \"Not sorry to meet\nyou, but to meet you in such surroundings.\"\n\n\"What fault do you find with my surroundings?\"\n\n\"Well, these people,\" answered Clay, \"they are so foolish, so futile.\nYou shouldn't be here.  There must be something else better than this.\nYou can't make me believe that you choose it. In Europe you could have\na salon, or you could influence statesmen.  There surely must be\nsomething here for you to turn to as well.  Something better than\ngolf-sticks and salted almonds.\"\n\n\"What do you know of me?\" said Miss Langham, steadily.  \"Only what you\nhave read of me in impertinent paragraphs.  How do you know I am fitted\nfor anything else but just this?  You never spoke with me before\nto-night.\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it,\" said Clay, quickly.  \"Time is made\nfor ordinary people.  When people who amount to anything meet they\ndon't have to waste months in finding each other out. It is only the\ndoubtful ones who have to be tested again and again.  When I was a kid\nin the diamond mines in Kimberley, I have seen the experts pick out a\nperfect diamond from the heap at the first glance, and without a\nmoment's hesitation.  It was the cheap stones they spent most of the\nafternoon over.  Suppose I HAVE only seen you to-night for the first\ntime; suppose I shall not see you again, which is quite likely, for I\nsail tomorrow for South America--what of that?  I am just as sure of\nwhat you are as though I had known you for years.\"\n\nMiss Langham looked at him for a moment in silence.  Her beauty was so\ngreat that she could take her time to speak.  She was not afraid of\nlosing any one's attention.\n\n\"And have you come out of the West, knowing me so well, just to tell me\nthat I am wasting myself?\" she said.  \"Is that all?\"\n\n\"That is all,\" answered Clay.  \"You know the things I would like to\ntell you,\" he added, looking at her closely.\n\n\"I think I like to be told the other things best,\" she said, \"they are\nthe easier to believe.\"\n\n\"You have to believe whatever I tell you,\" said Clay, smiling. The girl\npressed her hands together in her lap, and looked at him curiously.\nThe people about them were moving and making their farewells, and they\nbrought her back to the present with a start.\n\n\"I'm sorry you're going away,\" she said.  \"It has been so odd. You come\nsuddenly up out of the wilderness, and set me to thinking and try to\ntrouble me with questions about myself, and then steal away again\nwithout stopping to help me to settle them. Is it fair?\"  She rose and\nput out her hand, and he took it and held it for a moment, while they\nstood looking at one another.\n\n\"I am coming back,\" he said, \"and I will find that you have settled\nthem for yourself.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" she said, in so low a tone that the people standing near\nthem could not hear.  \"You haven't asked me for it, you know, but--I\nthink I shall let you keep that picture.\"\n\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Clay, smiling, \"I meant to.\"\n\n\"You can keep it,\" she continued, turning back, \"because it is not my\npicture.  It is a picture of a girl who ceased to exist four years ago,\nand whom you have never met.  Good-night.\"\n\nMr. Langham and Hope, his younger daughter, had been to the theatre.\nThe performance had been one which delighted Miss Hope, and which\nsatisfied her father because he loved to hear her laugh.  Mr. Langham\nwas the slave of his own good fortune.  By instinct and education he\nwas a man of leisure and culture, but the wealth he had inherited was\nlike an unruly child that needed his constant watching, and in keeping\nit well in hand he had become a man of business, with time for nothing\nelse.\n\nAlice Langham, on her return from Mrs. Porter's dinner, found him in\nhis study engaged with a game of solitaire, while Hope was kneeling on\na chair beside him with her elbows on the table. Mr. Langham had been\ntroubled with insomnia of late, and so it often happened that when\nAlice returned from a ball she would find him sitting with a novel, or\nhis game of solitaire, and Hope, who had crept downstairs from her bed,\ndozing in front of the open fire and keeping him silent company.  The\nfather and the younger daughter were very close to one another, and had\ngrown especially so since his wife had died and his son and heir had\ngone to college.  This fourth member of the family was a great bond of\nsympathy and interest between them, and his triumphs and escapades at\nYale were the chief subjects of their conversation. It was told by the\ndirectors of a great Western railroad, who had come to New York to\ndiscuss an important question with Mr. Langham, that they had been\nushered downstairs one night into his basement, where they had found\nthe President of the Board and his daughter Hope working out a game of\nfootball on the billiard table.  They had chalked it off into what\ncorresponded to five-yard lines, and they were hurling twenty-two\nchess-men across it in \"flying wedges\" and practising the several\ntricks which young Langham had intrusted to his sister under an oath of\nsecrecy.  The sight filled the directors with the horrible fear that\nbusiness troubles had turned the President's mind, but after they had\nsat for half an hour perched on the high chairs around the table, while\nHope excitedly explained the game to them, they decided that he was\nwiser than they knew, and each left the house regretting he had no son\nworthy enough to bring \"that young girl\" into the Far West.\n\n\"You are home early,\" said Mr. Langham, as Alice stood above him\npulling at her gloves.  \"I thought you said you were going on to some\ndance.\"\n\n\"I was tired,\" his daughter answered.\n\n\"Well, when I'm out,\" commented Hope, \"I won't come home at eleven\no'clock.  Alice always was a quitter.\"\n\n\"A what?\" asked the older sister.\n\n\"Tell us what you had for dinner,\" said Hope.  \"I know it isn't nice to\nask,\" she added, hastily, \"but I always like to know.\"\n\n\"I don't remember,\" Miss Langham answered, smiling at her father,\n\"except that he was very much sunburned and had most perplexing eyes.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course,\" assented Hope, \"I suppose you mean by that that you\ntalked with some man all through dinner.  Well, I think there is a time\nfor everything.\"\n\n\"Father,\" interrupted Miss Langham, \"do you know many engineers--I mean\ndo you come in contact with them through the railroads and mines you\nhave an interest in?  I am rather curious about them,\" she said,\nlightly.  \"They seem to be a most picturesque lot of young men.\"\n\n\"Engineers?  Of course,\" said Mr. Langham, vaguely, with the ten of\nspades held doubtfully in air.  \"Sometimes we have to depend upon them\naltogether.  We decide from what the engineering experts tell us\nwhether we will invest in a thing or not.\"\n\n\"I don't think I mean the big men of the profession,\" said his\ndaughter, doubtfully.  \"I mean those who do the rough work.  The men\nwho dig the mines and lay out the railroads.  Do you know any of them?\"\n\n\"Some of them,\" said Mr. Langham, leaning back and shuffling the cards\nfor a new game.  \"Why?\"\n\n\"Did you ever hear of a Mr. Robert Clay?\"\n\nMr. Langham smiled as he placed the cards one above the other in even\nrows.  \"Very often,\" he said.  \"He sails to-morrow to open up the\nlargest iron deposits in South America.  He goes for the Valencia\nMining Company.  Valencia is the capital of Olancho, one of those\nlittle republics down there.\"\n\n\"Do you--are you interested in that company?\" asked Miss Langham,\nseating herself before the fire and holding out her hands toward it.\n\"Does Mr. Clay know that you are?\"\n\n\"Yes--I am interested in it,\" Mr. Langham replied, studying the cards\nbefore him, \"but I don't think Clay knows it--nobody knows it yet,\nexcept the president and the other officers.\"  He lifted a card and put\nit down again in some indecision.  \"It's generally supposed to be\noperated by a company, but all the stock is owned by one man.  As a\nmatter of fact, my dear children,\" exclaimed Mr. Langham, as he placed\na deuce of clubs upon a deuce of spades with a smile of content, \"the\nValencia Mining Company is your beloved father.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Miss Langham, as she looked steadily into the fire.\n\nHope tapped her lips gently with the back of her hand to hide the fact\nthat she was sleepy, and nudged her father's elbow.  \"You shouldn't\nhave put the deuce there,\" she said, \"you should have used it to build\nwith on the ace.\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nA year before Mrs. Porter's dinner a tramp steamer on her way to the\ncapital of Brazil had steered so close to the shores of Olancho that\nher solitary passenger could look into the caverns the waves had\ntunnelled in the limestone cliffs along the coast. The solitary\npassenger was Robert Clay, and he made a guess that the white palisades\nwhich fringed the base of the mountains along the shore had been forced\nup above the level of the sea many years before by some volcanic\naction.  Olancho, as many people know, is situated on the northeastern\ncoast of South America, and its shores are washed by the main\nequatorial current.  From the deck of a passing vessel you can obtain\nbut little idea of Olancho or of the abundance and tropical beauty\nwhich lies hidden away behind the rampart of mountains on her shore.\nYou can see only their desolate dark-green front, and the white caves\nat their base, into which the waves rush with an echoing roar, and in\nand out of which fly continually thousands of frightened bats.\n\nThe mining engineer on the rail of the tramp steamer observed this\npeculiar formation of the coast with listless interest, until he noted,\nwhen the vessel stood some thirty miles north of the harbor of\nValencia, that the limestone formation had disappeared, and that the\nwaves now beat against the base of the mountains themselves.  There\nwere five of these mountains which jutted out into the ocean, and they\nsuggested roughly the five knuckles of a giant hand clenched and lying\nflat upon the surface of the water.  They extended for seven miles, and\nthen the caverns in the palisades began again and continued on down the\ncoast to the great cliffs that guard the harbor of Olancho's capital.\n\n\"The waves tunnelled their way easily enough until they ran up against\nthose five mountains,\" mused the engineer, \"and then they had to fall\nback.\"  He walked to the captain's cabin and asked to look at a map of\nthe coast line.  \"I believe I won't go to Rio,\" he said later in the\nday; \"I think I will drop off here at Valencia.\"\n\nSo he left the tramp steamer at that place and disappeared into the\ninterior with an ox-cart and a couple of pack-mules, and returned to\nwrite a lengthy letter from the Consul's office to a Mr. Langham in the\nUnited States, knowing he was largely interested in mines and in\nmining.  \"There are five mountains filled with ore,\" Clay wrote, \"which\nshould be extracted by open-faced workings.  I saw great masses of red\nhematite lying exposed on the side of the mountain, only waiting a pick\nand shovel, and at one place there were five thousand tons in plain\nsight.  I should call the stuff first-class Bessemer ore, running about\nsixty-three per cent metallic iron.  The people know it is there, but\nhave no knowledge of its value, and are too lazy to ever work it\nthemselves.  As to transportation, it would only be necessary to run a\nfreight railroad twenty miles along the sea-coast to the harbor of\nValencia and dump your ore from your own pier into your own vessels.\nIt would not, I think, be possible to ship direct from the mines\nthemselves, even though, as I say, the ore runs right down into the\nwater, because there is no place at which it would be safe for a large\nvessel to touch.  I will look into the political side of it and see\nwhat sort of a concession I can get for you.  I should think ten per\ncent of the output would satisfy them, and they would, of course, admit\nmachinery and plant free of duty.\"\n\nSix months after this communication had arrived in New York City, the\nValencia Mining Company was formally incorporated, and a man named Van\nAntwerp, with two hundred workmen and a half-dozen assistants, was sent\nSouth to lay out the freight railroad, to erect the dumping-pier, and\nto strip the five mountains of their forests and underbrush.  It was\nnot a task for a holiday, but a stern, difficult, and perplexing\nproblem, and Van Antwerp was not quite the man to solve it.  He was\nstubborn, self-confident, and indifferent by turns.  He did not depend\nupon his lieutenants, but jealously guarded his own opinions from the\nleast question or discussion, and at every step he antagonized the\neasy-going people among whom he had come to work.  He had no patience\nwith their habits of procrastination, and he was continually offending\ntheir lazy good-nature and their pride.  He treated the rich planters,\nwho owned the land between the mines and the harbor over which the\nfreight railroad must run, with as little consideration as he showed\nthe regiment of soldiers which the Government had farmed out to the\ncompany to serve as laborers in the mines.  Six months after Van\nAntwerp had taken charge at Valencia, Clay, who had finished the\nrailroad in Mexico, of which King had spoken, was asked by telegraph to\nundertake the work of getting the ore out of the mountains he had\ndiscovered, and shipping it North.  He accepted the offer and was given\nthe title of General Manager and Resident Director, and an enormous\nsalary, and was also given to understand that the rough work of\npreparation had been accomplished, and that the more important service\nof picking up the five mountains and putting them in fragments into\ntramp steamers would continue under his direction.  He had a letter of\nrecall for Van Antwerp, and a letter of introduction to the Minister of\nMines and Agriculture.  Further than that he knew nothing of the work\nbefore him, but he concluded, from the fact that he had been paid the\nalmost prohibitive sum he had asked for his services, that it must be\nimportant, or that he had reached that place in his career when he\ncould stop actual work and live easily, as an expert, on the work of\nothers.\n\nClay rolled along the coast from Valencia to the mines in a\npaddle-wheeled steamer that had served its usefulness on the\nMississippi, and which had been rotting at the levees in New Orleans,\nwhen Van Antwerp had chartered it to carry tools and machinery to the\nmines and to serve as a private launch for himself.  It was a choice\neither of this steamer and landing in a small boat, or riding along the\nline of the unfinished railroad on horseback.  Either route consumed\nsix valuable hours, and Clay, who was anxious to see his new field of\naction, beat impatiently upon the rail of the rolling tub as it\nwallowed in the sea.\n\nHe spent the first three days after his arrival at the mines in the\nmountains, climbing them on foot and skirting their base on horseback,\nand sleeping where night overtook him.  Van Antwerp did not accompany\nhim on his tour of inspection through the mines, but delegated that\nduty to an engineer named MacWilliams, and to Weimer, the United States\nConsul at Valencia, who had served the company in many ways and who was\nin its closest confidence.\n\nFor three days the men toiled heavily over fallen trunks and trees,\nslippery with the moss of centuries, or slid backward on the rolling\nstones in the waterways, or clung to their ponies' backs to dodge the\nhanging creepers.  At times for hours together they walked in single\nfile, bent nearly double, and seeing nothing before them but the\nshining backs and shoulders of the negroes who hacked out the way for\nthem to go.  And again they would come suddenly upon a precipice, and\ndrink in the soft cool breath of the ocean, and look down thousands of\nfeet upon the impenetrable green under which they had been crawling,\nout to where it met the sparkling surface of the Caribbean Sea.  It was\nthree days of unceasing activity while the sun shone, and of anxious\nquestionings around the camp-fire when the darkness fell, and when\nthere were no sounds on the mountain-side but that of falling water in\na distant ravine or the calls of the night-birds.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day Clay and his attendants returned to\ncamp and rode to where the men had just begun to blast away the sloping\nsurface of the mountain.\n\nAs Clay passed between the zinc sheds and palm huts of the\nsoldier-workmen, they came running out to meet him, and one, who seemed\nto be a leader, touched his bridle, and with his straw sombrero in his\nhand begged for a word with el Senor the Director.\n\nThe news of Clay's return had reached the opening, and the throb of the\ndummy-engines and the roar of the blasting ceased as the\nassistant-engineers came down the valley to greet the new manager.\nThey found him seated on his horse gazing ahead of him, and listening\nto the story of the soldier, whose fingers, as he spoke, trembled in\nthe air, with all the grace and passion of his Southern nature, while\nback of him his companions stood humbly, in a silent chorus, with\neager, supplicating eyes.  Clay answered the man's speech curtly, with\na few short words, in the Spanish patois in which he had been\naddressed, and then turned and smiled grimly upon the expectant group\nof engineers.  He kept them waiting for some short space, while he\nlooked them over carefully, as though he had never seen them before.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" he said, \"I'm glad to have you here all together.  I\nam only sorry you didn't come in time to hear what this fellow has had\nto say.  I don't as a rule listen that long to complaints, but he told\nme what I have seen for myself and what has been told me by others.  I\nhave been here three days now, and I assure you, gentlemen, that my\neasiest course would be to pack up my things and go home on the next\nsteamer.  I was sent down here to take charge of a mine in active\noperation, and I find--what?  I find that in six months you have done\nalmost nothing, and that the little you have condescended to do has\nbeen done so badly that it will have to be done over again; that you\nhave not only wasted a half year of time--and I can't tell how much\nmoney--but that you have succeeded in antagonizing all the people on\nwhose good-will we are absolutely dependent; you have allowed your\nmachinery to rust in the rain, and your workmen to rot with sickness.\nYou have not only done nothing, but you haven't a blue print to show me\nwhat you meant to do.  I have never in my life come across laziness and\nmismanagement and incompetency upon such a magnificent and reckless\nscale.  You have not built the pier, you have not opened the freight\nroad, you have not taken out an ounce of ore.  You know more of\nValencia than you know of these mines; you know it from the Alameda to\nthe Canal.  You can tell me what night the band plays in the Plaza, but\nyou can't give me the elevation of one of these hills.  You have spent\nyour days on the pavements in front of cafés, and your nights in\ndance-halls, and you have been drawing salaries every month.  I've more\nrespect for these half-breeds that you've allowed to starve in this\nfever-bed than I have for you.  You have treated them worse than they'd\ntreat a dog, and if any of them die, it's on your heads.  You have put\nthem in a fever-camp which you have not even taken the trouble to\ndrain.  Your commissariat is rotten, and you have let them drink all\nthe rum they wanted.  There is not one of you--\"\n\nThe group of silent men broke, and one of them stepped forward and\nshook his forefinger at Clay.\n\n\"No man can talk to me like that,\" he said, warningly, \"and think I'll\nwork under him.  I resign here and now.\"\n\n\"You what--\" cried Clay, \"you resign?\"\n\nHe whirled his horse round with a dig of his spur and faced them.\n\n\"How dare you talk of resigning?  I'll pack the whole lot of you back\nto New York on the first steamer, if I want to, and I'll give you such\ncharacters that you'll be glad to get a job carrying a transit.  You're\nin no position to talk of resigning yet--not one of you.  Yes,\" he\nadded, interrupting himself, \"one of you is MacWilliams, the man who\nhad charge of the railroad.  It's no fault of his that the road's not\nworking.  I understand that he couldn't get the right of way from the\npeople who owned the land, but I have seen what he has done, and his\nplans, and I apologize to him--to MacWilliams.  As for the rest of you,\nI'll give you a month's trial.  It will be a month before the next\nsteamer could get here anyway, and I'll give you that long to redeem\nyourselves.  At the end of that time we will have another talk, but you\nare here now only on your good behavior and on my sufferance.\nGood-morning.\"\n\nAs Clay had boasted, he was not the man to throw up his position\nbecause he found the part he had to play was not that of leading man,\nbut rather one of general utility, and although it had been several\nyears since it had been part of his duties to oversee the setting up of\nmachinery, and the policing of a mining camp, he threw himself as\nearnestly into the work before him as though to show his subordinates\nthat it did not matter who did the work, so long as it was done.  The\nmen at first were sulky, resentful, and suspicious, but they could not\nlong resist the fact that Clay was doing the work of five men and five\ndifferent kinds of work, not only without grumbling, but apparently\nwith the keenest pleasure.\n\nHe conciliated the rich coffee planters who owned the land which he\nwanted for the freight road by calls of the most formal state and\ndinners of much less formality, for he saw that the iron mine had its\nsocial as well as its political side.  And with this fact in mind, he\nopened the railroad with great ceremony, and much music and feasting,\nand the first piece of ore taken out of the mine was presented to the\nwife of the Minister of the Interior in a cluster of diamonds, which\nmade the wives of the other members of the Cabinet regret that their\nhusbands had not chosen that portfolio.  Six months followed of hard,\nunremitting work, during which time the great pier grew out into the\nbay from MacWilliams' railroad, and the face of the first mountain was\nscarred and torn of its green, and left in mangled nakedness, while the\nringing of hammers and picks, and the racking blasts of dynamite, and\nthe warning whistles of the dummy-engines drove away the accumulated\nsilence of centuries.\n\nIt had been a long uphill fight, and Clay had enjoyed it mightily.  Two\nunexpected events had contributed to help it.  One was the arrival in\nValencia of young Teddy Langham, who came ostensibly to learn the\nprofession of which Clay was so conspicuous an example, and in reality\nto watch over his father's interests.  He was put at Clay's elbow, and\nClay made him learn in spite of himself, for he ruled him and\nMacWilliams of both of whom he was very fond, as though, so they\ncomplained, they were the laziest and the most rebellious members of\nhis entire staff.  The second event of importance was the announcement\nmade one day by young Langham that his father's physician had ordered\nrest in a mild climate, and that he and his daughters were coming in a\nmonth to spend the winter in Valencia, and to see how the son and heir\nhad developed as a man of business.\n\nThe idea of Mr. Langham's coming to visit Olancho to inspect his new\npossessions was not a surprise to Clay.  It had occurred to him as\npossible before, especially after the son had come to join them there.\nThe place was interesting and beautiful enough in itself to justify a\nvisit, and it was only a ten days' voyage from New York.  But he had\nnever considered the chance of Miss Langham's coming, and when that was\nnow not only possible but a certainty, he dreamed of little else.  He\nlived as earnestly and toiled as indefatigably as before, but the place\nwas utterly transformed for him.  He saw it now as she would see it\nwhen she came, even while at the same time his own eyes retained their\npoint of view.  It was as though he had lengthened the focus of a\nglass, and looked beyond at what was beautiful and picturesque, instead\nof what was near at hand and practicable.  He found himself smiling\nwith anticipation of her pleasure in the orchids hanging from the dead\ntrees, high above the opening of the mine, and in the parrots hurling\nthemselves like gayly colored missiles among the vines; and he\nconsidered the harbor at night with its colored lamps floating on the\nblack water as a scene set for her eyes.  He planned the dinners that\nhe would give in her honor on the balcony of the great restaurant in\nthe Plaza on those nights when the band played, and the senoritas\ncircled in long lines between admiring rows of officers and caballeros.\nAnd he imagined how, when the ore-boats had been filled and his work\nhad slackened, he would be free to ride with her along the rough\nmountain roads, between magnificent pillars of royal palms, or to\nventure forth in excursions down the bay, to explore the caves and to\nlunch on board the rolling paddle-wheel steamer, which he would have re\npainted and gilded for her coming.  He pictured himself acting as her\nguide over the great mines, answering her simple questions about the\nstrange machinery, and the crew of workmen, and the local government by\nwhich he ruled two thousand men.  It was not on account of any personal\npride in the mines that he wanted her to see them, it was not because\nhe had discovered and planned and opened them that he wished to show\nthem to her, but as a curious spectacle that he hoped would give her a\nmoment's interest.\n\nBut his keenest pleasure was when young Langham suggested that they\nshould build a house for his people on the edge of the hill that jutted\nout over the harbor and the great ore pier.  If this were done, Langham\nurged, it would be possible for him to see much more of his family than\nhe would be able to do were they installed in the city, five miles away.\n\n\"We can still live in the office at this end of the railroad,\" the boy\nsaid, \"and then we shall have them within call at night when we get\nback from work; but if they are in Valencia, it will take the greater\npart of the evening going there and all of the night getting back, for\nI can't pass that club under three hours. It will keep us out of\ntemptation.\"\n\n\"Yes, exactly,\" said Clay, with a guilty smile, \"it will keep us out of\ntemptation.\"\n\nSo they cleared away the underbrush, and put a double force of men to\nwork on what was to be the most beautiful and comfortable bungalow on\nthe edge of the harbor.  It had blue and green and white tiles on the\nfloors, and walls of bamboo, and a red roof of curved tiles to let in\nthe air, and dragons' heads for water-spouts, and verandas as broad as\nthe house itself.  There was an open court in the middle hung with\nbalconies looking down upon a splashing fountain, and to decorate this\npatio, they levied upon people for miles around for tropical plants and\ncolored mats and awnings.  They cut down the trees that hid the view of\nthe long harbor leading from the sea into Valencia, and planted a\nrampart of other trees to hide the iron-ore pier, and they sodded the\nraw spots where the men had been building, until the place was as\ncompletely transformed as though a fairy had waved her wand above it.\n\nIt was to be a great surprise, and they were all--Clay, MacWilliams,\nand Langham--as keenly interested in it as though each were preparing\nit for his honeymoon.  They would be walking together in Valencia when\none would say, \"We ought to have that for the house,\" and without\nquestion they would march into the shop together and order whatever\nthey fancied to be sent out to the house of the president of the mines\non the hill.  They stocked it with wine and linens, and hired a volante\nand six horses, and fitted out the driver with a new pair of boots that\nreached above his knees, and a silver jacket and a sombrero that was so\nheavy with braid that it flashed like a halo about his head in the\nsunlight, and he was ordered not to wear it until the ladies came,\nunder penalty of arrest.  It delighted Clay to find that it was only\nthe beautiful things and the fine things of his daily routine that\nsuggested her to him, as though she could not be associated in his mind\nwith anything less worthy, and he kept saying to himself, \"She will\nlike this view from the end of the terrace,\" and \"This will be her\nfavorite walk,\" or \"She will swing her hammock here,\" and \"I know she\nwill not fancy the rug that Weimer chose.\"\n\nWhile this fairy palace was growing the three men lived as roughly as\nbefore in the wooden hut at the terminus of the freight road, three\nhundred yards below the house, and hidden from it by an impenetrable\nrampart of brush and Spanish bayonet. There was a rough road leading\nfrom it to the city, five miles away, which they had extended still\nfarther up the hill to the Palms, which was the name Langham had\nselected for his father's house.  And when it was finally finished,\nthey continued to live under the corrugated zinc roof of their office\nbuilding, and locking up the Palms, left it in charge of a gardener and\na watchman until the coming of its rightful owners.\n\nIt had been a viciously hot, close day, and even now the air came in\nsickening waves, like a blast from the engine-room of a steamer, and\nthe heat lightning played round the mountains over the harbor and\nshowed the empty wharves, and the black outlines of the steamers, and\nthe white front of the Custom-House, and the long half-circle of\ntwinkling lamps along the quay. MacWilliams and Langham sat panting on\nthe lower steps of the office-porch considering whether they were too\nlazy to clean themselves and be rowed over to the city, where, as it\nwas Sunday night, was promised much entertainment.  They had been for\nthe last hour trying to make up their minds as to this, and appealing\nto Clay to stop work and decide for them.  But he sat inside at a table\nfiguring and writing under the green shade of a student's lamp and made\nno answer.  The walls of Clay's office were of unplaned boards,\nbristling with splinters, and hung with blue prints and outline maps of\nthe mine.  A gaudily colored portrait of Madame la Presidenta, the\nnoble and beautiful woman whom Alvarez, the President of Olancho, had\nlately married in Spain, was pinned to the wall above the table.  This\ntable, with its green oil-cloth top, and the lamp, about which winged\ninsects beat noisily, and an earthen water-jar--from which the water\ndripped as regularly as the ticking of a clock--were the only articles\nof furniture in the office.  On a shelf at one side of the door lay the\nmen's machetes, a belt of cartridges, and a revolver in a holster.\n\nClay rose from the table and stood in the light of the open door,\nstretching himself gingerly, for his joints were sore and stiff with\nfording streams and climbing the surfaces of rocks. The red ore and\nyellow mud of the mines were plastered over his boots and\nriding-breeches, where he had stood knee-deep in the water, and his\nshirt stuck to him like a wet bathing-suit, showing his ribs when he\nbreathed and the curves of his broad chest.  A ring of burning paper\nand hot ashes fell from his cigarette to his breast and burnt a hole\nthrough the cotton shirt, and he let it lie there and watched it burn\nwith a grim smile.\n\n\"I wanted to see,\" he explained, catching the look of listless\ncuriosity in MacWilliams's eye, \"whether there was anything hotter than\nmy blood.  It's racing around like boiling water in a pot.\"\n\n\"Listen,\" said Langham, holding up his hand.  \"There goes the call for\nprayers in the convent, and now it's too late to go to town.  I am\nglad, rather.  I'm too tired to keep awake, and besides, they don't\nknow how to amuse themselves in a civilized way--at least not in my\nway.  I wish I could just drop in at home about now; don't you,\nMacWilliams?  Just about this time up in God's country all the people\nare at the theatre, or they've just finished dinner and are sitting\naround sipping cool green mint, trickling through little lumps of ice.\nWhat I'd like--\" he stopped and shut one eye and gazed, with his head\non one side, at the unimaginative MacWilliams--\"what I'd like to do\nnow,\" he continued, thoughtfully, \"would be to sit in the front row at\na comic opera, ON THE AISLE.  The prima donna must be very, very\nbeautiful, and sing most of her songs at me, and there must be three\ncomedians, all good, and a chorus entirely composed of girls.  I never\ncould see why they have men in the chorus, anyway.  No one ever looks\nat them.  Now that's where I'd like to be.  What would you like,\nMacWilliams?\"\n\nMacWilliams was a type with which Clay was intimately familiar, but to\nthe college-bred Langham he was a revelation and a joy. He came from\nsome little town in the West, and had learned what he knew of\nengineering at the transit's mouth, after he had first served his\napprenticeship by cutting sage-brush and driving stakes.  His life had\nbeen spent in Mexico and Central America, and he spoke of the home he\nhad not seen in ten years with the aggressive loyalty of the confirmed\nwanderer, and he was known to prefer and to import canned corn and\ncanned tomatoes in preference to eating the wonderful fruits of the\ncountry, because the former came from the States and tasted to him of\nhome.  He had crowded into his young life experiences that would have\nshattered the nerves of any other man with a more sensitive conscience\nand a less happy sense of humor; but these same experiences had only\nserved to make him shrewd and self-confident and at his ease when the\noccasion or difficulty came.\n\nHe pulled meditatively on his pipe and considered Langham's question\ndeeply, while Clay and the younger boy sat with their arms upon their\nknees and waited for his decision in thoughtful silence.\n\n\"I'd like to go to the theatre, too,\" said MacWilliams, with an air as\nthough to show that he also was possessed of artistic tastes.  \"I'd\nlike to see a comical chap I saw once in '80--oh, long ago--before I\njoined the P. Q. & M.  He WAS funny.  His name was Owens; that was his\nname, John E. Owens--\"\n\n\"Oh, for heaven's sake, MacWilliams,\" protested Langham, in dismay;\n\"he's been dead for five years.\"\n\n\"Has he?\" said MacWilliams, thoughtfully.  \"Well--\" he concluded,\nunabashed, \"I can't help that, he's the one I'd like to see best.\"\n\n\"You can have another wish, Mac, you know,\" urged Langham, \"can't he,\nClay?\"\n\nClay nodded gravely, and MacWilliams frowned again in thought. \"No,\" he\nsaid after an effort, \"Owens, John E. Owens; that's the one I want to\nsee.\"\n\n\"Well, now I want another wish, too,\" said Langham.  \"I move we can\neach have two wishes. I wish--\"\n\n\"Wait until I've had mine,\" said Clay.  \"You've had one turn. I want to\nbe in a place I know in Vienna.  It's not hot like this, but cool and\nfresh.  It's an open, out-of-door concert-garden, with hundreds of\ncolored lights and trees, and there's always a breeze coming through.\nAnd Eduard Strauss, the son, you know, leads the orchestra there, and\nthey play nothing but waltzes, and he stands in front of them, and\nbegins by raising himself on his toes, and then he lifts his shoulders\ngently--and then sinks back again and raises his baton as though he\nwere drawing the music out after it, and the whole place seems to rock\nand move.  It's like being picked up and carried on the deck of a yacht\nover great waves; and all around you are the beautiful Viennese women\nand those tall Austrian officers in their long, blue coats and flat\nhats and silver swords.  And there are cool drinks--\" continued Clay,\nwith his eyes fixed on the coming storm--\"all sorts of cool drinks--in\nhigh, thin glasses, full of ice, all the ice you want--\"\n\n\"Oh, drop it, will you?\" cried Langham, with a shrug of his damp\nshoulders.  \"I can't stand it.  I'm parching.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" interrupted MacWilliams, leaning forward and looking\ninto the night.  \"Some one's coming.\"  There was a sound down the road\nof hoofs and the rattle of the land-crabs as they scrambled off into\nthe bushes, and two men on horseback came suddenly out of the darkness\nand drew rein in the light from the open door.  The first was General\nMendoza, the leader of the Opposition in the Senate, and the other, his\norderly.  The General dropped his Panama hat to his knee and bowed in\nthe saddle three times.\n\n\"Good-evening, your Excellency,\" said Clay, rising.  \"Tell that peon to\nget my coat, will you?\" he added, turning to Langham.  Langham clapped\nhis hands, and the clanging of a guitar ceased, and their servant and\ncook came out from the back of the hut and held the General's horse\nwhile he dismounted.  \"Wait until I get you a chair,\" said Clay.\n\"You'll find those steps rather bad for white duck.\"\n\n\"I am fortunate in finding you at home,\" said the officer, smiling, and\nshowing his white teeth.  \"The telephone is not working.  I tried at\nthe club, but I could not call you.\"\n\n\"It's the storm, I suppose,\" Clay answered, as he struggled into his\njacket.  \"Let me offer you something to drink.\"  He entered the house,\nand returned with several bottles on a tray and a bundle of cigars.\nThe Spanish-American poured himself out a glass of water, mixing it\nwith Jamaica rum, and said, smiling again, \"It is a saying of your\ncountrymen that when a man first comes to Olancho he puts a little rum\ninto his water, and that when he is here some time he puts a little\nwater in his rum.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" laughed Clay.  \"I'm afraid that's true.\"\n\nThere was a pause while the men sipped at their glasses, and looked at\nthe horses and the orderly.  The clanging of the guitar began again\nfrom the kitchen.  \"You have a very beautiful view here of the harbor,\nyes,\" said Mendoza.  He seemed to enjoy the pause after his ride, and\nto be in no haste to begin on the object of his errand.  MacWilliams\nand Langham eyed each other covertly, and Clay examined the end of his\ncigar, and they all waited.\n\n\"And how are the mines progressing, eh?\" asked the officer, genially.\n\"You find much good iron in them, they tell me.\"\n\n\"Yes, we are doing very well,\" Clay assented; \"it was difficult at\nfirst, but now that things are in working order, we are getting out\nabout ten thousand tons a month.  We hope to increase that soon to\ntwenty thousand when the new openings are developed and our shipping\nfacilities are in better shape.\"\n\n\"So much!\" exclaimed the General, pleasantly.\n\n\"Of which the Government of my country is to get its share of ten per\ncent--one thousand tons!  It is munificent!\"  He laughed and shook his\nhead slyly at Clay, who smiled in dissent.\n\n\"But you see, sir,\" said Clay, \"you cannot blame us.  The mines have\nalways been there, before this Government came in, before the Spaniards\nwere here, before there was any Government at all, but there was not\nthe capital to open them up, I suppose, or--and it needed a certain\nenergy to begin the attack.  Your people let the chance go, and, as it\nturned out, I think they were very wise in doing so.  They get ten per\ncent of the output. That's ten per cent on nothing, for the mines\nreally didn't exist, as far as you were concerned, until we came, did\nthey? They were just so much waste land, and they would have remained\nso.  And look at the price we paid down before we cut a tree. Three\nmillions of dollars; that's a good deal of money.  It will be some time\nbefore we realize anything on that investment.\"\n\nMendoza shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.  \"I will be frank\nwith you,\" he said, with the air of one to whom dissimulation is\ndifficult.  \"I come here to-night on an unpleasant errand, but it is\nwith me a matter of duty, and I am a soldier, to whom duty is the\nforemost ever.  I have come to tell you, Mr. Clay, that we, the\nOpposition, are not satisfied with the manner in which the Government\nhas disposed of these great iron deposits.  When I say not satisfied,\nmy dear friend, I speak most moderately.  I should say that we are\nsurprised and indignant, and we are determined the wrong it has done\nour country shall be righted.  I have the honor to have been chosen to\nspeak for our party on this most important question, and on next\nTuesday, sir,\" the General stood up and bowed, as though he were before\na great assembly, \"I will rise in the Senate and move a vote of want of\nconfidence in the Government for the manner in which it has given away\nthe richest possessions in the storehouse of my country, giving it not\nonly to aliens, but for a pittance, for a share which is not a share,\nbut a bribe, to blind the eyes of the people.  It has been a shameful\nbargain, and I cannot say who is to blame; I accuse no one.  But I\nsuspect, and I will demand an investigation; I will demand that the\nvalue not of one-tenth, but of one-half of all the iron that your\ncompany takes out of Olancho shall be paid into the treasury of the\nState.  And I come to you to-night, as the Resident Director, to inform\nyou beforehand of my intention.  I do not wish to take you unprepared.\nI do not blame your people; they are business men, they know how to\nmake good bargains, they get what they best can.  That is the rule of\ntrade, but they have gone too far, and I advise you to communicate with\nyour people in New York and learn what they are prepared to offer\nnow--now that they have to deal with men who do not consider their own\ninterests but the interests of their country.\"\n\nMendoza made a sweeping bow and seated himself, frowning dramatically,\nwith folded arms.  His voice still hung in the air, for he had spoken\nas earnestly as though he imagined himself already standing in the hall\nof the Senate championing the cause of the people.\n\nMacWilliams looked up at Clay from where he sat on the steps below him,\nbut Clay did not notice him, and there was no sound, except the quick\nsputtering of the nicotine in Langham's pipe, at which he pulled\nquickly, and which was the only outward sign the boy gave of his\ninterest.  Clay shifted one muddy boot over the other and leaned back\nwith his hands stuck in his belt.\n\n\"Why didn't you speak of this sooner?\" he asked.\n\n\"Ah, yes, that is fair,\" said the General, quickly.  \"I know that it is\nlate, and I regret it, and I see that we cause you inconvenience; but\nhow could I speak sooner when I was ignorant of what was going on?  I\nhave been away with my troops.  I am a soldier first, a politician\nafter.  During the last year I have been engaged in guarding the\nfrontier.  No news comes to a General in the field moving from camp to\ncamp and always in the saddle; but I may venture to hope, sir, that\nnews has come to you of me?\"\n\nClay pressed his lips together and bowed his head.\n\n\"We have heard of your victories, General, yes,\" he said; \"and on your\nreturn you say you found things had not been going to your liking?\"\n\n\"That is it,\" assented the other, eagerly.  \"I find that indignation\nreigns on every side.  I find my friends complaining of the railroad\nwhich you run across their land.  I find that fifteen hundred soldiers\nare turned into laborers, with picks and spades, working by the side of\nnegroes and your Irish; they have not been paid their wages, and they\nhave been fed worse than though they were on the march; sickness and--\"\n\nClay moved impatiently and dropped his boot heavily on the porch.\n\n\"That was true at first,\" he interrupted, \"but it is not so now.  I\nshould be glad, General, to take you over the men's quarters at any\ntime.  As for their not having been paid, they were never paid by their\nown Government before they came to us and for the same reason, because\nthe petty officers kept back the money, just as they have always done.\nBut the men are paid now.  However, this is not of the most importance.\nWho is it that complains of the terms of our concession?\"\n\n\"Every one!\" exclaimed Mendoza, throwing out his arms, \"and they ask,\nmoreover, this: they ask why, if this mine is so rich, why was not the\nstock offered here to us in this country?  Why was it not put on the\nmarket, that any one might buy?  We have rich men in Olancho, why\nshould not they benefit first of all others by the wealth of their own\nlands?  But no! we are not asked to buy.  All the stock is taken in New\nYork, no one benefits but the State, and it receives only ten per cent.\nIt is monstrous!\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Clay, gravely.  \"That had not occurred to me before.\nThey feel they have been slighted.  I see.\"  He paused for a moment as\nif in serious consideration.  \"Well,\" he added, \"that might be\narranged.\"\n\nHe turned and jerked his head toward the open door.  \"If you boys mean\nto go to town to-night, you'd better be moving,\" he said.  The two men\nrose together and bowed silently to their guest.\n\n\"I should like if Mr. Langham would remain a moment with us,\" said\nMendoza, politely.  \"I understand that it is his father who controls\nthe stock of the company.  If we discuss any arrangement it might be\nwell if he were here.\"\n\nClay was sitting with his chin on his breast, and he did not look up,\nnor did the young man turn to him for any prompting.  \"I'm not down\nhere as my father's son,\" he said, \"I am an employee of Mr. Clay's.  He\nrepresents the company.  Good-night, sir.\"\n\n\"You think, then,\" said Clay, \"that if your friends were given an\nopportunity to subscribe to the stock they would feel less resentful\ntoward us?  They would think it was fairer to all?\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Mendoza; \"why should the stock go out of the country\nwhen those living here are able to buy it?\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Clay, \"of course.  Can you tell me this, General?  Are\nthe gentlemen who want to buy stock in the mine the same men who are in\nthe Senate?  The men who are objecting to the terms of our concession?\"\n\n\"With a few exceptions they are the same men.\"\n\nClay looked out over the harbor at the lights of the town, and the\nGeneral twirled his hat around his knee and gazed with appreciation at\nthe stars above him.\n\n\"Because if they are,\" Clay continued, \"and they succeed in getting our\nshare cut down from ninety per cent to fifty per cent, they must see\nthat the stock would be worth just forty per cent less than it is now.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" assented the other.  \"I have thought of that, and if\nthe Senators in Opposition were given a chance to subscribe, I am sure\nthey would see that it is better wisdom to drop their objections to the\nconcession, and as stockholders allow you to keep ninety per cent of\nthe output.  And, again,\" continued Mendoza, \"it is really better for\nthe country that the money should go to its people than that it should\nbe stored up in the vaults of the treasury, when there is always the\ndanger that the President will seize it; or, if not this one, the next\none.\"\n\n\"I should think--that is--it seems to me,\" said Clay with careful\nconsideration, \"that your Excellency might be able to render us great\nhelp in this matter yourself.  We need a friend among the Opposition.\nIn fact--I see where you could assist us in many ways, where your\nservices would be strictly in the line of your public duty and yet\nbenefit us very much.  Of course I cannot speak authoritatively without\nfirst consulting Mr. Langham; but I should think he would allow you\npersonally to purchase as large a block of the stock as you could wish,\neither to keep yourself or to resell and distribute among those of your\nfriends in Opposition where it would do the most good.\"\n\nClay looked over inquiringly to where Mendoza sat in the light of the\nopen door, and the General smiled faintly, and emitted a pleased little\nsigh of relief.  \"Indeed,\" continued Clay, \"I should think Mr. Langham\nmight even save you the formality of purchasing the stock outright by\nsending you its money equivalent.  I beg your pardon,\" he asked,\ninterrupting himself, \"does your orderly understand English?\"\n\n\"He does not,\" the General assured him, eagerly, dragging his chair a\nlittle closer.\n\n\"Suppose now that Mr. Langham were to put fifty or let us say sixty\nthousand dollars to your account in the Valencia Bank, do you think\nthis vote of want of confidence in the Government on the question of\nour concession would still be moved?\"\n\n\"I am sure it would not,\" exclaimed the leader of the Opposition,\nnodding his head violently.\n\n\"Sixty thousand dollars,\" repeated Clay, slowly, \"for yourself; and do\nyou think, General, that were you paid that sum you would be able to\ncall off your friends, or would they make a demand for stock also?\"\n\n\"Have no anxiety at all, they do just what I say,\" returned Mendoza, in\nan eager whisper.  \"If I say 'It is all right, I am satisfied with what\nthe Government has done in my absence,' it is enough.  And I will say\nit, I give you the word of a soldier, I will say it.  I will not move a\nvote of want of confidence on Tuesday.  You need go no farther than\nmyself.  I am glad that I am powerful enough to serve you, and if you\ndoubt me\"--he struck his heart and bowed with a deprecatory smile--\"you\nneed not pay in the money in exchange for the stock all at the same\ntime.  You can pay ten thousand this year, and next year ten thousand\nmore and so on, and so feel confident that I shall have the interests\nof the mine always in my heart.  Who knows what may not happen in a\nyear?  I may be able to serve you even more.  Who knows how long the\npresent Government will last?  But I give you my word of honor, no\nmatter whether I be in Opposition or at the head of the Government, if\nI receive every six months the retaining fee of which you speak, I will\nbe your representative.  And my friends can do nothing.  I despise\nthem.  _I_ am the Opposition.  You have done well, my dear sir, to\nconsider me alone.\"\n\nClay turned in his chair and looked back of him through the office to\nthe room beyond.\n\n\"Boys,\" he called, \"you can come out now.\"\n\nHe rose and pushed his chair away and beckoned to the orderly who sat\nin the saddle holding the General's horse.  Langham and MacWilliams\ncame out and stood in the open door, and Mendoza rose and looked at\nClay.\n\n\"You can go now,\" Clay said to him, quietly.  \"And you can rise in the\nSenate on Tuesday and move your vote of want of confidence and object\nto our concession, and when you have resumed your seat the Secretary of\nMines will rise in his turn and tell the Senate how you stole out here\nin the night and tried to blackmail me, and begged me to bribe you to\nbe silent, and that you offered to throw over your friends and to take\nall that we would give you and keep it yourself.  That will make you\npopular with your friends, and will show the Government just what sort\nof a leader it has working against it.\"\n\nClay took a step forward and shook his finger in the officer's face.\n\"Try to break that concession; try it.  It was made by one Government\nto a body of honest, decent business men, with a Government of their\nown back of them, and if you interfere with our conceded rights to work\nthose mines, I'll have a man-of-war down here with white paint on her\nhull, and she'll blow you and your little republic back up there into\nthe mountains.  Now you can go.\"\n\nMendoza had straightened with surprise when Clay first began to speak,\nand had then bent forward slightly as though he meant to interrupt him.\nHis eyebrows were lowered in a straight line, and his lips moved\nquickly.\n\n\"You poor--\" he began, contemptuously.  \"Bah,\" he exclaimed, \"you're a\nfool; I should have sent a servant to talk with you. You are a\nchild--but you are an insolent child,\" he cried, suddenly, his anger\nbreaking out, \"and I shall punish you.  You dare to call me names!  You\nshall fight me, you shall fight me to-morrow.  You have insulted an\nofficer, and you shall meet me at once, to-morrow.\"\n\n\"If I meet you to-morrow,\" Clay replied, \"I will thrash you for your\nimpertinence.  The only reason I don't do it now is because you are on\nmy doorstep.  You had better not meet me tomorrow, or at any other\ntime.  And I have no leisure to fight duels with anybody.\"\n\n\"You are a coward,\" returned the other, quietly, \"and I tell you so\nbefore my servant.\"\n\nClay gave a short laugh and turned to MacWilliams in the doorway.\n\n\"Hand me my gun, MacWilliams,\" he said, \"it's on the shelf to the\nright.\"\n\nMacWilliams stood still and shook his head.  \"Oh, let him alone,\" he\nsaid.  \"You've got him where you want him.\"\n\n\"Give me the gun, I tell you,\" repeated Clay.  \"I'm not going to hurt\nhim, I'm only going to show him how I can shoot.\"\n\nMacWilliams moved grudgingly across the porch and brought back the\nrevolver and handed it to Clay. \"Look out now,\" he said, \"it's loaded.\"\n\nAt Clay's words the General had retreated hastily to his horse's head\nand had begun unbuckling the strap of his holster, and the orderly\nreached back into the boot for his carbine.  Clay told him in Spanish\nto throw up his hands, and the man, with a frightened look at his\nofficer, did as the revolver suggested. Then Clay motioned with his\nempty hand for the other to desist. \"Don't do that,\" he said, \"I'm not\ngoing to hurt you; I'm only going to frighten you a little.\"\n\nHe turned and looked at the student lamp inside, where it stood on the\ntable in full view.  Then he raised his revolver.  He did not\napparently hold it away from him by the butt, as other men do, but let\nit lie in the palm of his hand, into which it seemed to fit like the\nhand of a friend.  His first shot broke the top of the glass chimney,\nthe second shattered the green globe around it, the third put out the\nlight, and the next drove the lamp crashing to the floor.  There was a\nwild yell of terror from the back of the house, and the noise of a\nguitar falling down a flight of steps.  \"I have probably killed a very\ngood cook,\" said Clay, \"as I should as certainly kill you, if I were to\nmeet you.  Langham,\" he continued, \"go tell that cook to come back.\"\n\nThe General sprang into his saddle, and the altitude it gave him seemed\nto bring back some of the jauntiness he had lost.\n\n\"That was very pretty,\" he said; \"you have been a cowboy, so they tell\nme.  It is quite evident by your manners.  No matter, if we do not meet\nto-morrow it will be because I have more serious work to do.  Two\nmonths from to-day there will be a new Government in Olancho and a new\nPresident, and the mines will have a new director.  I have tried to be\nyour friend, Mr. Clay. See how you like me for an enemy.  Goodnight,\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" said MacWilliams, unmoved.  \"Please ask your man to close\nthe gate after you.\"\n\nWhen the sound of the hoofs had died away the men still stood in an\nuncomfortable silence, with Clay twirling the revolver around his\nmiddle finger.  \"I'm sorry I had to make a gallery play of that sort,\"\nhe said.  \"But it was the only way to make that sort of man understand.\"\n\nLangham sighed and shook his head ruefully.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I thought all the trouble was over, but it looks to\nme as though it had just begun.  So far as I can see they're going to\ngive the governor a run for his money yet.\"\n\nClay turned to MacWilliams.\n\n\"How many of Mendoza's soldiers have we in the mines, Mac?\" he asked.\n\n\"About fifteen hundred,\" MacWilliams answered.  \"But you ought to hear\nthe way they talk of him.\"\n\n\"They do, eh?\" said Clay, with a smile of satisfaction. \"That's good.\n'Six hundred slaves who hate their masters.' What do they say about me?\"\n\n\"Oh, they think you're all right.  They know you got them their pay and\nall that.  They'd do a lot for you.\"\n\n\"Would they fight for me?\" asked Clay.\n\nMacWilliams looked up and laughed uneasily.  \"I don't know,\" he said.\n\"Why, old man?  What do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Clay answered.  \"I was just wondering whether I\nshould like to be President of Olancho.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\nThe Langhams were to arrive on Friday, and during the week before that\nday Clay went about with a long slip of paper in his pocket which he\nwould consult earnestly in corners, and upon which he would note down\nthe things that they had left undone.  At night he would sit staring at\nit and turning it over in much concern, and would beg Langham to tell\nhim what he could have meant when he wrote \"see Weimer,\" or \"clean\nbrasses,\" or \"S. Q. M.\" \"Why should I see Weimer,\" he would exclaim,\n\"and which brasses, and what does S. Q. M. stand for, for heaven's\nsake?\"\n\nThey held a full-dress rehearsal in the bungalow to improve its state\nof preparation, and drilled the servants and talked English to them, so\nthat they would know what was wanted when the young ladies came.  It\nwas an interesting exercise, and had the three young men been less\nserious in their anxiety to welcome the coming guests they would have\nfound themselves very amusing--as when Langham would lean over the\nbalcony in the court and shout back into the kitchen, in what was\nsupposed to be an imitation of his sister's manner, \"Bring my coffee\nand rolls--and don't take all day about it either,\" while Clay and\nMacWilliams stood anxiously below to head off the servants when they\ncarried in a can of hot water instead of bringing the horses round to\nthe door, as they had been told to do.\n\n\"Of course it's a bit rough and all that,\" Clay would say, \"but they\nhave only to tell us what they want changed and we can have it ready\nfor them in an hour.\"\n\n\"Oh, my sisters are all right,\" Langham would reassure him; \"they'll\nthink it's fine.  It will be like camping-out to them, or a picnic.\nThey'll understand.\"\n\nBut to make sure, and to \"test his girders,\" as Clay put it, they gave\na dinner, and after that a breakfast.  The President came to the first,\nwith his wife, the Countess Manuelata, Madame la Presidenta, and\nCaptain Stuart, late of the Gordon Highlanders, and now in command of\nthe household troops at the Government House and of the body-guard of\nthe President.  He was a friend of Clay's and popular with every one\npresent, except for the fact that he occupied this position, instead of\nserving his own Government in his own army.  Some people said he had\nbeen crossed in love, others, less sentimental, that he had forged a\ncheck, or mixed up the mess accounts of his company.  But Clay and\nMacWilliams said it concerned no one why he was there, and then\nemphasized the remark by picking a quarrel with a man who had given an\nunpleasant reason for it.  Stuart, so far as they were concerned, could\ndo no wrong.\n\nThe dinner went off very well, and the President consented to dine with\nthem in a week, on the invitation of young Langham to meet his father.\n\n\"Miss Langham is very beautiful, they tell me,\" Madame Alvarez said to\nClay.  \"I heard of her one winter in Rome; she was presented there and\nmuch admired.\"\n\n\"Yes, I believe she is considered very beautiful,\" Clay said. \"I have\nonly just met her, but she has travelled a great deal and knows every\none who is of interest, and I think you will like her very much.\"\n\n\"I mean to like her,\" said the woman.  \"There are very few of the\nnative ladies who have seen much of the world beyond a trip to Paris,\nwhere they live in their hotels and at the dressmaker's while their\nhusbands enjoy themselves; and sometimes I am rather heart-sick for my\nhome and my own people.  I was overjoyed when I heard Miss Langham was\nto be with us this winter.  But you must not keep her out here to\nyourselves.  It is too far and too selfish.  She must spend some time\nwith me at the Government House.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Clay, \"I am afraid of that.  I am afraid the young ladies\nwill find it rather lonely out here.\"\n\n\"Ah, no,\" exclaimed the woman, quickly.  \"You have made it beautiful,\nand it is only a half-hour's ride, except when it rains,\" she added,\nlaughing, \"and then it is almost as easy to row as to ride.\"\n\n\"I will have the road repaired,\" interrupted the President. \"It is my\nwish, Mr. Clay, that you will command me in every way; I am most\ndesirous to make the visit of Mr. Langham agreeable to him, he is doing\nso much for us.\"\n\nThe breakfast was given later in the week, and only men were present.\nThey were the rich planters and bankers of Valencia, generals in the\narmy, and members of the Cabinet, and officers from the tiny war-ship\nin the harbor.  The breeze from the bay touched them through the open\ndoors, the food and wine cheered them, and the eager courtesy and\nhospitality of the three Americans pleased and flattered them.  They\nwere of a people who better appreciate the amenities of life than its\nsacrifices.\n\nThe breakfast lasted far into the afternoon, and, inspired by the\nsuccess of the banquet, Clay quite unexpectedly found himself on his\nfeet with his hand on his heart, thanking the guests for the good-will\nand assistance which they had given him in his work.  \"I have tramped\ndown your coffee plants, and cut away your forests, and disturbed your\nsleep with my engines, and you have not complained,\" he said, in his\nbest Spanish, \"and we will show that we are not ungrateful.\"\n\nThen Weimer, the Consul, spoke, and told them that in his Annual\nConsular Report, which he had just forwarded to the State Department,\nhe had related how ready the Government of Olancho had been to assist\nthe American company.  \"And I hope,\" he concluded, \"that you will allow\nme, gentlemen, to propose the health of President Alvarez and the\nmembers of his Cabinet.\"\n\nThe men rose to their feet, one by one, filling their glasses and\nlaughing and saying, \"Viva el Gobernador,\" until they were all\nstanding.  Then, as they looked at one another and saw only the faces\nof friends, some one of them cried, suddenly, \"To President Alvarez,\nDictator of Olancho!\"\n\nThe cry was drowned in a yell of exultation, and men sprang cheering to\ntheir chairs waving their napkins above their heads, and those who wore\nswords drew them and flashed them in the air, and the quiet, lazy\ngood-nature of the breakfast was turned into an uproarious scene of\nwild excitement.  Clay pushed back his chair from the head of the table\nwith an anxious look at the servants gathered about the open door, and\nWeimer clutched frantically at Langham's elbow and whispered, \"What did\nI say? For heaven's sake, how did it begin?\"\n\nThe outburst ceased as suddenly as it had started, and old General\nRojas, the Vice-President, called out, \"What is said is said, but it\nmust not be repeated.\"\n\nStuart waited until after the rest had gone, and Clay led him out to\nthe end of the veranda.  \"Now will you kindly tell me what that was?\"\nClay asked.  \"It didn't sound like champagne.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the other, \"I thought you knew.  Alvarez means to proclaim\nhimself Dictator, if he can, before the spring elections.\"\n\n\"And are you going to help him?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the Englishman, simply.\n\n\"Well, that's all right,\" said Clay, \"but there's no use shouting the\nfact all over the shop like that--and they shouldn't drag me into it.\"\n\nStuart laughed easily and shook his head.  \"It won't be long before\nyou'll be in it yourself,\" he said.\n\nClay awoke early Friday morning to hear the shutters beating viciously\nagainst the side of the house, and the wind rushing through the palms,\nand the rain beating in splashes on the zinc roof.  It did not come\nsoothingly and in a steady downpour, but brokenly, like the rush of\nwaves sweeping over a rough beach.  He turned on the pillow and shut\nhis eyes again with the same impotent and rebellious sense of\ndisappointment that he used to feel when he had wakened as a boy and\nfound it storming on his holiday, and he tried to sleep once more in\nthe hope that when he again awoke the sun would be shining in his eyes;\nbut the storm only slackened and did not cease, and the rain continued\nto fall with dreary, relentless persistence.  The men climbed the muddy\nroad to the Palms, and viewed in silence the wreck which the night had\nbrought to their plants and garden paths.  Rivulets of muddy water had\ncut gutters over the lawn and poured out from under the veranda, and\nplants and palms lay bent and broken, with their broad leaves\nbedraggled and coated with mud.  The harbor and the encircling\nmountains showed dimly through a curtain of warm, sticky rain.  To\nsomething that Langham said of making the best of it, MacWilliams\nreplied, gloomily, that he would not be at all surprised if the ladies\nrefused to leave the ship and demanded to be taken home immediately.\n\"I am sorry,\" Clay said, simply; \"I wanted them to like it.\"\n\nThe men walked back to the office in grim silence, and took turns in\nwatching with a glass the arms of the semaphore, three miles below, at\nthe narrow opening of the bay.  Clay smiled nervously at himself, with\na sudden sinking at the heart, and with a hot blush of pleasure, as he\nthought of how often he had looked at its great arms out lined like a\nmast against the sky, and thanked it in advance for telling him that\nshe was near.  In the harbor below, the vessels lay with bare yards and\nempty decks, the wharves were deserted, and only an occasional small\nboat moved across the beaten surface of the bay.\n\nBut at twelve o'clock MacWilliams lowered the glass quickly, with a\nlittle gasp of excitement, rubbed its moist lens on the inside of his\ncoat and turned it again toward a limp strip of bunting that was\ncrawling slowly up the halyards of the semaphore.  A second dripping\nrag answered it from the semaphore in front of the Custom-House, and\nMacWilliams laughed nervously and shut the glass.\n\n\"It's red,\" he said; \"they've come.\"\n\nThey had planned to wear white duck suits, and go out in a launch with\na flag flying, and they had made MacWilliams purchase a red cummerbund\nand a pith helmet; but they tumbled into the launch now, wet and\nbedraggled as they were, and raced Weimer in his boat, with the\nAmerican flag clinging to the pole, to the side of the big steamer as\nshe drew slowly into the bay.  Other row-boats and launches and\nlighters began to push out from the wharves, men appeared under the\nsagging awnings of the bare houses along the river-front, and the\ncustom and health officers in shining oil-skins and puffing damp cigars\nclambered over the side.\n\n\"I see them,\" cried Langham, jumping up and rocking the boat in his\nexcitement.  \"There they are in the bow.  That's Hope waving.  Hope!\nhullo, Hope!\" he shouted, \"hullo!\" Clay recognized her standing between\nthe younger sister and her father, with the rain beating on all of\nthem, and waving her hand to Langham.  The men took off their hats, and\nas they pulled up alongside she bowed to Clay and nodded brightly.\nThey sent Langham up the gangway first, and waited until he had made\nhis greetings to his family alone.\n\n\"We have had a terrible trip, Mr. Clay,\" Miss Langham said to him,\nbeginning, as people will, with the last few days, as though they were\nof the greatest importance; \"and we could see nothing of you at the\nmines at all as we passed--only a wet flag, and a lot of very friendly\nworkmen, who cheered and fired off pans of dynamite.\"\n\n\"They did, did they?\" said Clay, with a satisfied nod. \"That's all\nright, then.  That was a royal salute in your honor. Kirkland had that\nto do.  He's the foreman of A opening.  I am awfully sorry about this\nrain--it spoils everything.\"\n\n\"I hope it hasn't spoiled our breakfast,\" said Mr. Langham. \"We haven't\neaten anything this morning, because we wanted a change of diet, and\nthe captain told us we should be on shore before now.\"\n\n\"We have some carriages for you at the wharf, and we will drive you\nright out to the Palms,\" said young Langham.  \"It's shorter by water,\nbut there's a hill that the girls couldn't climb today. That's the\nhouse we built for you, Governor, with the flag-pole, up there on the\nhill; and there's your ugly old pier; and that's where we live, in the\nlittle shack above it, with the tin roof; and that opening to the right\nis the terminus of the railroad MacWilliams built.  Where's\nMacWilliams?  Here, Mac, I want you to know my father.  This is\nMacWilliams, sir, of whom I wrote you.\"\n\nThere was some delay about the baggage, and in getting the party\ntogether in the boats that Langham and the Consul had brought; and\nafter they had stood for some time on the wet dock, hungry and damp, it\nwas rather aggravating to find that the carriages which Langham had\nordered to be at one pier had gone to another.  So the new arrivals sat\nrather silently under the shed of the levee on a row of cotton-bales,\nwhile Clay and MacWilliams raced off after the carriages.\n\n\"I wish we didn't have to keep the hood down,\" young Langham said,\nanxiously, as they at last proceeded heavily up the muddy streets; \"it\nmakes it so hot, and you can't see anything.  Not that it's worth\nseeing in all this mud and muck, but it's great when the sun shines.\nWe had planned it all so differently.\"\n\nHe was alone with his family now in one carriage, and the other men and\nthe servants were before them in two others.  It seemed an interminable\nride to them all--to the strangers, and to the men who were anxious\nthat they should be pleased.  They left the city at last, and toiled\nalong the limestone road to the Palms, rocking from side to side and\nsinking in ruts filled with rushing water.  When they opened the flap\nof the hood the rain beat in on them, and when they closed it they\nstewed in a damp, warm atmosphere of wet leather and horse-hair.\n\n\"This is worse than a Turkish bath,\" said Hope, faintly. \"Don't you\nlive anywhere, Ted?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's not far now,\" said the younger brother, dismally; but even as\nhe spoke the carriage lurched forward and plunged to one side and came\nto a halt, and they could hear the streams rushing past the wheels like\nthe water at the bow of a boat.  A wet, black face appeared at the\nopening of the hood, and a man spoke despondently in Spanish.\n\n\"He says we're stuck in the mud,\" explained Langham.  He looked at them\nso beseechingly and so pitifully, with the perspiration streaming down\nhis face, and his clothes damp and bedraggled, that Hope leaned back\nand laughed, and his father patted him on the knee.  \"It can't be any\nworse,\" he said, cheerfully; \"it must mend now.  It is not your fault,\nTed, that we're starving and lost in the mud.\"\n\nLangham looked out to find Clay and MacWilliams knee-deep in the\nrunning water, with their shoulders against the muddy wheels, and the\ndriver lashing at the horses and dragging at their bridles. He sprang\nout to their assistance, and Hope, shaking off her sister's detaining\nhands, jumped out after him, laughing.  She splashed up the hill to the\nhorses' heads, motioning to the driver to release his hold on their\nbridles.\n\n\"That is not the way to treat a horse,\" she said.  \"Let me have them.\nAre you men all ready down there?\" she called. Each of the three men\nglued a shoulder to a wheel, and clenched his teeth and nodded.  \"All\nright, then,\" Hope called back. She took hold of the huge Mexican bits\nclose to the mouth, where the pressure was not so cruel, and then\ncoaxing and tugging by turns, and slipping as often as the horses\nthemselves, she drew them out of the mud, and with the help of the men\nback of the carriage pulled it clear until it stood free again at the\ntop of the hill.  Then she released her hold on the bridles and looked\ndown, in dismay, at her frock and hands, and then up at the three men.\nThey appeared so utterly miserable and forlorn in their muddy garments,\nand with their faces washed with the rain and perspiration, that the\ngirl gave way suddenly to an uncontrollable shriek of delight.  The men\nstared blankly at her for a moment, and then inquiringly at one\nanother, and as the humor of the situation struck them they burst into\nan echoing shout of laughter, which rose above the noise of the wind\nand rain, and before which the disappointments and trials of the\nmorning were swept away.  Before they reached the Palms the sun was out\nand shining with fierce brilliancy, reflecting its rays on every damp\nleaf, and drinking up each glistening pool of water.\n\nMacWilliams and Clay left the Langhams alone together, and returned to\nthe office, where they assured each other again and again that there\nwas no doubt, from what each had heard different members of the family\nsay, that they were greatly pleased with all that had been prepared for\nthem.\n\n\"They think it's fine!\" said young Langham, who had run down the hill\nto tell them about it.  \"I tell you, they are pleased. I took them all\nover the house, and they just exclaimed every minute.  Of course,\" he\nsaid, dispassionately, \"I thought they'd like it, but I had no idea it\nwould please them as much as it has.  My Governor is so delighted with\nthe place that he's sitting out there on the veranda now, rocking\nhimself up and down and taking long breaths of sea-air, just as though\nhe owned the whole coast-line.\"\n\nLangham dined with his people that night, Clay and MacWilliams having\npromised to follow him up the hill later.  It was a night of much\nmoment to them all, and the two men ate their dinner in silence, each\nconsidering what the coming of the strangers might mean to him.\n\nAs he was leaving the room MacWilliams stopped and hovered uncertainly\nin the doorway.\n\n\"Are you going to get yourself into a dress-suit to-night?\" he asked.\nClay said that he thought he would; he wanted to feel quite clean once\nmore.\n\n\"Well, all right, then,\" the other returned, reluctantly. \"I'll do it\nfor this once, if you mean to, but you needn't think I'm going to make\na practice of it, for I'm not.  I haven't worn a dress-suit,\" he\ncontinued, as though explaining his principles in the matter, \"since\nyour spread when we opened the railroad--that's six months ago; and the\ntime before that I wore one at MacGolderick's funeral.  MacGolderick\nblew himself up at Puerto Truxillo, shooting rocks for the breakwater.\nWe never found all of him, but we gave what we could get together as\nfine a funeral as those natives ever saw.  The boys, they wanted to\nmake him look respectable, so they asked me to lend them my dress-suit,\nbut I told them I meant to wear it myself.  That's how I came to wear a\ndress-suit at a funeral.  It was either me or MacGolderick.\"\n\n\"MacWilliams,\" said Clay, as he stuck the toe of one boot into the heel\nof the other, \"if I had your imagination I'd give up railroading and\ntake to writing war clouds for the newspapers.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you don't believe that story?\" MacWilliams demanded,\nsternly.\n\n\"I do,\" said Clay, \"I mean I don't.\"\n\n\"Well, let it go,\" returned MacWilliams, gloomily; \"but there's been\nfunerals for less than that, let me tell you.\"\n\nA half-hour later MacWilliams appeared in the door and stood gazing\nattentively at Clay arranging his tie before a hand-glass, and then at\nhimself in his unusual apparel.\n\n\"No wonder you voted to dress up,\" he exclaimed finally, in a tone of\npersonal injury.  \"That's not a dress-suit you've got on anyway.  It\nhasn't any tails.  And I hope for your sake, Mr. Clay,\" he continued,\nhis voice rising in plaintive indignation, \"that you are not going to\nplay that scarf on us for a vest. And you haven't got a high collar on,\neither.  That's only a rough blue print of a dress-suit.  Why, you look\njust as comfortable as though you were going to enjoy yourself--and you\nlook cool, too.\"\n\n\"Well, why not?\" laughed Clay.\n\n\"Well, but look at me,\" cried the other.  \"Do I look cool?  Do I look\nhappy or comfortable?  No, I don't.  I look just about the way I feel,\nlike a fool undertaker.  I'm going to take this thing right off.  You\nand Ted Langham can wear your silk scarfs and bobtail coats, if you\nlike, but if they don't want me in white duck they don't get me.\"\n\nWhen they reached the Palms, Clay asked Miss Langham if she did not\nwant to see his view.  \"And perhaps, if you appreciate it properly, I\nwill make you a present of it,\" he said, as he walked before her down\nthe length of the veranda.\n\n\"It would be very selfish to keep it all to my self,\" she said.\n\n\"Couldn't we share it?\"  They had left the others seated facing the\nbay, with MacWilliams and young Langham on the broad steps of the\nveranda, and the younger sister and her father sitting in long bamboo\nsteamer-chairs above them.\n\nClay and Miss Langham were quite alone.  From the high cliff on which\nthe Palms stood they could look down the narrow inlet that joined the\nocean and see the moonlight turning the water into a rippling ladder of\nlight and gilding the dark green leaves of the palms near them with a\nborder of silver.  Directly below them lay the waters of the bay,\nreflecting the red and green lights of the ships at anchor, and beyond\nthem again were the yellow lights of the town, rising one above the\nother as the city crept up the hill.  And back of all were the\nmountains, grim and mysterious, with white clouds sleeping in their\nhuge valleys, like masses of fog.\n\nExcept for the ceaseless murmur of the insect life about them the night\nwas absolutely still--so still that the striking of the ships' bells in\nthe harbor came to them sharply across the surface of the water, and\nthey could hear from time to time the splash of some great fish and the\nsteady creaking of an oar in a rowlock that grew fainter and fainter as\nit grew further away, until it was drowned in the distance.  Miss\nLangham was for a long time silent.  She stood with her hands clasped\nbehind her, gazing from side to side into the moonlight, and had\napparently forgotten that Clay was present.\n\n\"Well,\" he said at last, \"I think you appreciate it properly. I was\nafraid you would exclaim about it, and say it was fine, or charming, or\nsomething.\"\n\nMiss Langham turned to him and smiled slightly.  \"And you told me once\nthat you knew me so very well,\" she said.\n\nClay chose to forget much that he had said on that night when he had\nfirst met her.  He knew that he had been bold then, and had dared to be\nso because he did not think he would see her again; but, now that he\nwas to meet her every day through several months, it seemed better to\nhim that they should grow to know each other as they really were,\nsimply and sincerely, and without forcing the situation in any way.\n\nSo he replied, \"I don't know you so well now.  You must remember I\nhaven't seen you for a year.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you hadn't seen me for twenty-two years then,\" she answered.\n\"I don't think you have changed much,\" she went on. \"I expected to find\nyou gray with cares.  Ted wrote us about the way you work all day at\nthe mines and sit up all night over calculations and plans and reports.\nBut you don't show it.  When are you going to take us over the mines?\nTo-morrow?  I am very anxious to see them, but I suppose father will\nwant to inspect them first.  Hope knows all about them, I believe; she\nknows their names, and how much you have taken out, and how much you\nhave put in, too, and what MacWilliams's railroad cost, and who got the\ncontract for the ore pier.  Ted told us in his letters, and she used to\nwork it out on the map in father's study.  She is a most energetic\nchild; I think sometimes she should have been a boy.  I wish I could be\nthe help to any one that she is to my father and to me.  Whenever I am\nblue or down she makes fun of me, and--\"\n\n\"Why should you ever be blue?\" asked Clay, abruptly.\n\n\"There is no real reason, I suppose,\" the girl answered, smiling,\n\"except that life is so very easy for me that I have to invent some\nwoes.  I should be better for a few reverses.\"  And then she went on in\na lower voice, and turning her head away, \"In our family there is no\nwoman older than I am to whom I can go with questions that trouble me.\nHope is like a boy, as I said, and plays with Ted, and my father is\nvery busy with his affairs, and since my mother died I have been very\nmuch alone.  A man cannot understand.  And I cannot understand why I\nshould be speaking to you about myself and my troubles, except--\" she\nadded, a little wistfully, \"that you once said you were interested in\nme, even if it was as long as a year ago. And because I want you to be\nvery kind to me, as you have been to Ted, and I hope that we are going\nto be very good friends.\"\n\nShe was so beautiful, standing in the shadow with the moonlight about\nher and with her hand held out to him, that Clay felt as though the\nscene were hardly real.  He took her hand in his and held it for a\nmoment.  His pleasure in the sweet friendliness of her manner and in\nher beauty was so great that it kept him silent.\n\n\"Friends!\" he laughed under his breath.  \"I don't think there is much\ndanger of our not being friends.  The danger lies,\" he went on,\nsmiling, \"in my not being able to stop there.\"\n\nMiss Langham made no sign that she had heard him, but turned and walked\nout into the moonlight and down the porch to where the others were\nsitting.\n\nYoung Langham had ordered a native orchestra of guitars and reed\ninstruments from the town to serenade his people, and they were\nstanding in front of the house in the moonlight as Miss Langham and\nClay came forward.  They played the shrill, eerie music of their\ncountry with a passion and feeling that filled out the strange tropical\nscene around them; but Clay heard them only as an accompaniment to his\nown thoughts, and as a part of the beautiful night and the tall,\nbeautiful girl who had dominated it.  He watched her from the shadow as\nshe sat leaning easily forward and looking into the night.  The\nmoonlight fell full upon her, and though she did not once look at him\nor turn her head in his direction, he felt as though she must be\nconscious of his presence, as though there were already an\nunderstanding between them which she herself had established.  She had\nasked him to be her friend.  That was only a pretty speech, perhaps;\nbut she had spoken of herself, and had hinted at her perplexities and\nher loneliness, and he argued that while it was no compliment to be\nasked to share another's pleasure, it must mean something when one was\nallowed to learn a little of another's troubles.\n\nAnd while his mind was flattered and aroused by this promise of\nconfidence between them, he was rejoicing in the rare quality of her\nbeauty, and in the thought that she was to be near him, and near him\nhere, of all places.  It seemed a very wonderful thing to\nClay--something that could only have happened in a novel or a play.\nFor while the man and the hour frequently appeared together, he had\nfound that the one woman in the world and the place and the man was a\nmuch more difficult combination to bring into effect.  No one, he\nassured himself thankfully, could have designed a more lovely setting\nfor his love-story, if it was to be a love-story, and he hoped it was,\nthan this into which she had come of her own free will.  It was a land\nof romance and adventure, of guitars and latticed windows, of warm\nbrilliant days and gorgeous silent nights, under purple heavens and\nwhite stars.  And he was to have her all to himself, with no one near\nto interrupt, no other friends, even, and no possible rival.  She was\nnot guarded now by a complex social system, with its responsibilities.\nHe was the most lucky of men.  Others had only seen her in her\ndrawing-room or in an opera-box, but he was free to ford\nmountain-streams at her side, or ride with her under arches of the\ngreat palms, or to play a guitar boldly beneath her window.  He was\nfree to come and go at any hour; not only free to do so, but the very\nnature of his duties made it necessary that they should be thrown\nconstantly together.\n\nThe music of the violins moved him and touched him deeply, and stirred\ndepths at which he had not guessed.  It made him humble and deeply\ngrateful, and he felt how mean and unworthy he was of such great\nhappiness.  He had never loved any woman as he felt that he could love\nthis woman, as he hoped that he was to love her.  For he was not so far\nblinded by her beauty and by what he guessed her character to be, as to\nimagine that he really knew her.  He only knew what he hoped she was,\nwhat he believed the soul must be that looked out of those kind,\nbeautiful eyes, and that found utterance in that wonderful voice which\ncould control him and move him by a word.\n\nHe felt, as he looked at the group before him, how lonely his own life\nhad been, how hard he had worked for so little--for what other men\nfound ready at hand when they were born into the world.\n\nHe felt almost a touch of self-pity at his own imperfectness; and the\npower of his will and his confidence in himself, of which he was so\nproud, seemed misplaced and little.  And then he wondered if he had not\nneglected chances; but in answer to this his injured self-love rose to\nrebut the idea that he had wasted any portion of his time, and he\nassured himself that he had done the work that he had cut out for\nhimself to do as best he could; no one but himself knew with what\ncourage and spirit.  And so he sat combating with himself, hoping one\nmoment that she would prove what he believed her to be, and the next,\nscandalized at his temerity in daring to think of her at all.\n\nThe spell lifted as the music ceased, and Clay brought himself back to\nthe moment and looked about him as though he were waking from a dream\nand had expected to see the scene disappear and the figures near him\nfade into the moonlight.\n\nYoung Langham had taken a guitar from one of the musicians and pressed\nit upon MacWilliams, with imperative directions to sing such and such\nsongs, of which, in their isolation, they had grown to think most\nhighly, and MacWilliams was protesting in much embarrassment.\n\nMacWilliams had a tenor voice which he maltreated in the most villanous\nmanner by singing directly through his nose.  He had a taste for\nsentimental songs, in which \"kiss\" rhymed with \"bliss,\" and in which\n\"the people cry\" was always sure to be followed with \"as she goes by,\nthat's pretty Katie Moody,\" or \"Rosie McIntyre.\"  He had gathered his\nsongs at the side of camp-fires, and in canteens at the first\nsection-house of a new railroad, and his original collection of ballads\nhad had but few additions in several years.  MacWilliams at first was\nshy, which was quite a new development, until he made them promise to\nlaugh if they wanted to laugh, explaining that he would not mind that\nso much as he would the idea that he thought he was serious.\n\nThe song of which he was especially fond was one called \"He never cares\nto wander from his own Fireside,\" which was especially appropriate in\ncoming from a man who had visited almost every spot in the three\nAmericas, except his home, in ten years.  MacWilliams always ended the\nevening's entertainment with this chorus, no matter how many times it\nhad been sung previously, and seemed to regard it with much the same\nveneration that the true Briton feels for his national anthem.\n\nThe words of the chorus were:\n\n    \"He never cares to wander from his own fireside,\n      He never cares to wander or to roam.\n      With his babies on his knee,\n      He's as happy as can be,\n      For there's no place like Home, Sweet Home.\"\n\nMacWilliams loved accidentals, and what he called \"barber-shop chords.\"\nHe used a beautiful accidental at the word \"be,\" of which he was very\nfond, and he used to hang on that note for a long time, so that those\nin the extreme rear of the hall, as he was wont to explain, should get\nthe full benefit of it.  And it was his custom to emphasize \"for\" in\nthe last line by speaking instead of singing it, and then coming to a\nfull stop before dashing on again with the excellent truth that \"there\nis NO place like Home, Sweet Home.\"\n\nThe men at the mines used to laugh at him and his song at first, but\nthey saw that it was not to be so laughed away, and that he regarded it\nwith some peculiar sentiment.  So they suffered him to sing it in peace.\n\nMacWilliams went through his repertoire to the unconcealed amusement of\nyoung Langham and Hope.  When he had finished he asked Hope if she knew\na comic song of which he had only heard by reputation.  One of the men\nat the mines had gained a certain celebrity by claiming to have heard\nit in the States, but as he gave a completely new set of words to the\ntune of the \"Wearing of the Green\" as the true version, his veracity\nwas doubted. Hope said she knew it, of course, and they all went into\nthe drawing-room, where the men grouped themselves about the piano. It\nwas a night they remembered long afterward.  Hope sat at the piano\nprotesting and laughing, but singing the songs of which the new-comers\nhad become so weary, but which the three men heard open-eyed, and\nhailed with shouts of pleasure.  The others enjoyed them and their\ndelight, as though they were people in a play expressing themselves in\nthis extravagant manner for their entertainment, until they understood\nhow poverty-stricken their lives had been and that they were not only\nenjoying the music for itself, but because it was characteristic of all\nthat they had left behind them.  It was pathetic to hear them boast of\nhaving read of a certain song in such a paper, and of the fact that\nthey knew the plot of a late comic opera and the names of those who had\nplayed in it, and that it had or had not been acceptable to the New\nYork public.\n\n\"Dear me,\" Hope would cry, looking over her shoulder with a despairing\nglance at her sister and father, \"they don't even know 'Tommy Atkins'!\"\n\nIt was a very happy evening for them all, foreshadowing, as it did, a\ncontinuation of just such evenings.  Young Langham was radiant with\npleasure at the good account which Clay had given of him to his father,\nand Mr. Langham was gratified, and proud of the manner in which his son\nand heir had conducted himself; and MacWilliams, who had never before\nbeen taken so simply and sincerely by people of a class that he had\nalways held in humorous awe, felt a sudden accession of dignity, and an\nunhappy fear that when they laughed at what he said, it was because its\nsense was so utterly different from their point of view, and not\nbecause they saw the humor of it.  He did not know what the word \"snob\"\nsignified, and in his roughened, easy-going nature there was no touch\nof false pride; but he could not help thinking how surprised his people\nwould be if they could see him, whom they regarded as a wanderer and\nrenegade on the face of the earth and the prodigal of the family, and\nfor that reason the best loved, leaning over a grand piano, while one\ndaughter of his much-revered president played comic songs for his\ndelectation, and the other, who according to the newspapers refused\nprinces daily, and who was the most wonderful creature he had ever\nseen, poured out his coffee and brought it to him with her own hands.\n\nThe evening came to an end at last, and the new arrivals accompanied\ntheir visitors to the veranda as they started to their cabin for the\nnight.  Clay was asking Mr. Langham when he wished to visit the mines,\nand the others were laughing over farewell speeches, when young Langham\nstartled them all by hurrying down the length of the veranda and\ncalling on them to follow.\n\n\"Look!\" he cried, pointing down the inlet.  \"Here comes a man-of-war,\nor a yacht.  Isn't she smart-looking?  What can she want here at this\nhour of the night?  They won't let them land.  Can you make her out,\nMacWilliams?\"\n\nA long, white ship was steaming slowly up the inlet, and passed within\na few hundred feet of the cliff on which they were standing.\n\n\"Why, it's the 'Vesta'!\" exclaimed Hope, wonderingly.  \"I thought she\nwasn't coming for a week?\"\n\n\"It can't be the 'Vesta'!\" said the elder sister; \"she was not to have\nsailed from Havana until to-day.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Langham.  \"Is it King's boat?  Do you expect\nhim here?  Oh, what fun!  I say, Clay, here's the 'Vesta,' Reggie\nKing's yacht, and he's no end of a sport.  We can go all over the place\nnow, and he can land us right at the door of the mines if we want to.\"\n\n\"Is it the King I met at dinner that night?\" asked Clay, turning to\nMiss Langham.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.  \"He wanted us to come down on the yacht, but we\nthought the steamer would be faster; so he sailed without us and was to\nhave touched at Havana, but he has apparently changed his course.\nDoesn't she look like a phantom ship in the moonlight?\"\n\nYoung Langham thought he could distinguish King among the white figures\non the bridge, and tossed his hat and shouted, and a man in the stern\nof the yacht replied with a wave of his hand.\n\n\"That must be Mr. King,\" said Hope.  \"He didn't bring any one with him,\nand he seems to be the only man aft.\"\n\nThey stood watching the yacht as she stopped with a rattle of\nanchor-chains and a confusion of orders that came sharply across the\nwater, and then the party separated and the three men walked down the\nhill, Langham eagerly assuring the other two that King was a very good\nsort, and telling them what a treasure-house his yacht was, and how he\nwould have probably brought the latest papers, and that he would\ncertainly give a dance on board in their honor.\n\nThe men stood for some short time together, after they had reached the\noffice, discussing the great events of the day, and then with cheerful\ngood-nights disappeared into their separate rooms.\n\nAn hour later Clay stood without his coat, and with a pen in his hand,\nat MacWilliams's bedside and shook him by the shoulder.\n\n\"I'm not asleep,\" said MacWilliams, sitting up; \"what is it? What have\nyou been doing?\" he demanded.  \"Not working?\"\n\n\"There were some reports came in after we left,\" said Clay, \"and I find\nI will have to see Kirkland to-morrow morning.  Send them word to run\nme down on an engine at five-thirty, will you? I am sorry to have to\nwake you, but I couldn't remember in which shack that engineer lives.\"\n\nMacWilliams jumped from his bed and began kicking about the floor for\nhis boots.  \"Oh, that's all right,\" he said.  \"I wasn't asleep, I was\njust--\" he lowered his voice that Langham might not hear him through\nthe canvas partitions--\"I was just lying awake playing duets with the\nPresident, and racing for the International Cup in my new centre-board\nyacht, that's all!\"\n\nMacWilliams buttoned a waterproof coat over his pajamas and stamped his\nbare feet into his boots.  \"Oh, I tell you, Clay,\" he said with a grim\nchuckle, \"we're mixing right in with the four hundred, we are!  I'm\nsubstitute and understudy when anybody gets ill.  We're right in our\nown class at last!  Pure amateurs with no professional record against\nus.  Me and President Langham, I guess!\" He struck a match and lit the\nsmoky wick in a tin lantern.\n\n\"But now,\" he said, cheerfully, \"my time being too valuable for me to\nsleep, I will go wake up that nigger engine-driver and set his alarm\nclock at five-thirty.  Five-thirty, I believe you said.  All right;\ngood-night.\"  And whistling cheerfully to himself MacWilliams\ndisappeared up the hill, his body hidden in the darkness and his legs\nshowing fantastically in the light of the swinging lantern.\n\nClay walked out upon the veranda and stood with his back to one of the\npillars.  MacWilliams and his pleasantries disturbed and troubled him.\nPerhaps, after all, the boy was right.  It seemed absurd, but it was\ntrue.  They were only employees of Langham--two of the thousands of\nyoung men who were working all over the United States to please him, to\nmake him richer, to whom he was only a name and a power, which meant an\nincrease of salary or the loss of place.\n\nClay laughed and shrugged his shoulders.  He knew that he was not in\nthat class; if he did good work it was because his self-respect\ndemanded it of him; he did not work for Langham or the Olancho Mining\nCompany (Limited).  And yet he turned with almost a feeling of\nresentment toward the white yacht lying calmly in magnificent repose a\nhundred yards from his porch.\n\nHe could see her as clearly in her circle of electric lights as though\nshe were a picture and held in the light of a stereopticon on a screen.\nHe could see her white decks, and the rails of polished brass, and the\ncomfortable wicker chairs and gay cushions and flat coils of rope, and\nthe tapering masts and intricate rigging.  How easy it was made for\nsome men!  This one had come like the prince in the fairy tale on his\nmagic carpet.  If Alice Langham were to leave Valencia that next day,\nClay could not follow her.  He had his duties and responsibilities; he\nwas at another man's bidding.\n\nBut this Prince Fortunatus had but to raise anchor and start in\npursuit, knowing that he would be welcome wherever he found her. That\nwas the worst of it to Clay, for he knew that men did not follow women\nfrom continent to continent without some assurance of a friendly\ngreeting.  Clay's mind went back to the days when he was a boy, when\nhis father was absent fighting for a lost cause; when his mother taught\nin a little schoolhouse under the shadow of Pike's Peak, and when Kit\nCarson was his hero.  He thought of the poverty of those days poverty\nso mean and hopeless that it was almost something to feel shame for; of\nthe days that followed when, an orphan and without a home, he had\nsailed away from New Orleans to the Cape.  How the mind of the\nmathematician, which he had inherited from the Boston schoolmistress,\nhad been swayed by the spirit of the soldier, which he had inherited\nfrom his father, and which led him from the mines of South Africa to\nlittle wars in Madagascar, Egypt, and Algiers.  It had been a life as\nrestless as the seaweed on a rock.  But as he looked back to its poor\nbeginnings and admitted to himself its later successes, he gave a sigh\nof content, and shaking off the mood stood up and paced the length of\nthe veranda.\n\nHe looked up the hill to the low-roofed bungalow with the palm-leaves\nabout it, outlined against the sky, and as motionless as patterns cut\nin tin.  He had built that house.  He had built it for her.  That was\nher room where the light was shining out from the black bulk of the\nhouse about it like a star.  And beyond the house he saw his five great\nmountains, the knuckles of the giant hand, with its gauntlet of iron\nthat lay shut and clenched in the face of the sea that swept up\nwhimpering before it.  Clay felt a boyish, foolish pride rise in his\nbreast as he looked toward the great mines he had discovered and\nopened, at the iron mountains that were crumbling away before his touch.\n\nHe turned his eyes again to the blazing yacht, and this time there was\nno trace of envy in them.  He laughed instead, partly with pleasure at\nthe thought of the struggle he scented in the air, and partly at his\nown braggadocio.\n\n\"I'm not afraid,\" he said, smiling, and shaking his head at the white\nship that loomed up like a man-of-war in the black waters. \"I'm not\nafraid to fight you for anything worth fighting for.\"\n\nHe bowed his bared head in good-night toward the light on the hill, as\nhe turned and walked back into his bedroom.  \"And I think,\" he murmured\ngrimly, as he put out the light, \"that she is worth fighting for.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\nThe work which had called Clay to the mines kept him there for some\ntime, and it was not until the third day after the arrival of the\nLanghams that he returned again to the Palms.  On the afternoon when he\nclimbed the hill to the bungalow he found the Langhams as he had left\nthem, with the difference that King now occupied a place in the family\ncircle.  Clay was made so welcome, and especially so by King, that he\nfelt rather ashamed of his sentiments toward him, and considered his\nthree days of absence to be well repaid by the heartiness of their\ngreeting.\n\n\"For myself,\" said Mr. Langham, \"I don't believe you had anything to do\nat the mines at all.  I think you went away just to show us how\nnecessary you are.  But if you want me to make a good report of our\nresident director on my return, you had better devote yourself less to\nthe mines while you are here and more to us.\"  Clay said he was glad to\nfind that his duties were to be of so pleasant a nature, and asked them\nwhat they had seen and what they had done.\n\nThey told him they had been nowhere, but had waited for his return in\norder that he might act as their guide.\n\n\"Then you should see the city at once,\" said Clay, \"and I will have the\nvolante brought to the door, and we can all go in this afternoon.\nThere is room for the four of you inside, and I can sit on the box-seat\nwith the driver.\"\n\n\"No,\" said King, \"let Hope or me sit on the box-seat.  Then we can\npractise our Spanish on the driver.\"\n\n\"Not very well,\" Clay replied, \"for the driver sits on the first horse,\nlike a postilion.  It's a sort of tandem without reins.  Haven't you\nseen it yet?  We consider the volante our proudest exhibit.\"  So Clay\nordered the volante to be brought out, and placed them facing each\nother in the open carriage, while he climbed to the box-seat, from\nwhich position of vantage he pointed out and explained the objects of\ninterest they passed, after the manner of a professional guide.  It was\na warm, beautiful afternoon, and the clear mists of the atmosphere\nintensified the rich blue of the sky, and the brilliant colors of the\nhouses, and the different shades of green of the trees and bushes that\nlined the highroad to the capital.\n\n\"To the right, as we descend,\" said Clay, speaking over his shoulder,\n\"you see a tin house.  It is the home of the resident director of the\nOlancho Mining Company (Limited), and of his able lieutenants, Mr.\nTheodore Langham and Mr. MacWilliams. The building on the extreme left\nis the round-house, in which Mr. MacWilliams stores his three\nlocomotive engines, and in the far middle-distance is Mr. MacWilliams\nhimself in the act of repairing a water-tank.  He is the one in a suit\nof blue overalls, and as his language at such times is free, we will\ndrive rapidly on and not embarrass him.  Besides,\" added the engineer,\nwith the happy laugh of a boy who had been treated to a holiday, \"I am\nsure that I am not setting him the example of fixity to duty which he\nshould expect from his chief.\"\n\nThey passed between high hedges of Spanish bayonet, and came to mud\ncabins thatched with palm-leaves, and alive with naked, little\nbrown-bodied children, who laughed and cheered to them as they passed.\n\n\"It's a very beautiful country for the pueblo,\" was Clay's comment.\n\"Different parts of the same tree furnish them with food, shelter, and\nclothing, and the sun gives them fuel, and the Government changes so\noften that they can always dodge the tax-collector.\"\n\nFrom the mud cabins they came to more substantial one-story houses of\nadobe, with the walls painted in two distinct colors, blue, pink, or\nyellow, with red-tiled roofs, and the names with which they had been\nchristened in bold black letters above the entrances.  Then the\ncarriage rattled over paved streets, and they drove between houses of\ntwo stories painted more decorously in pink and light blue, with\nwide-open windows, guarded by heavy bars of finely wrought iron and\nornamented with scrollwork in stucco.  The principal streets were given\nup to stores and cafés, all wide open to the pavement and protected\nfrom the sun by brilliantly striped awnings, and gay with the national\ncolors of Olancho in flags and streamers.  In front of them sat\nofficers in uniform, and the dark-skinned dandies of Valencia, in white\nduck suits and Panama hats, toying with tortoise shell canes, which\ncould be converted, if the occasion demanded, into blades of Toledo\nsteel.  In the streets were priests and bare-legged mule drivers, and\nragged ranchmen with red-caped cloaks hanging to their sandals, and\nnegro women, with bare shoulders and long trains, vending lottery\ntickets and rolling huge cigars between their lips.  It was an old\nstory to Clay and King, but none of the others had seen a\nSpanish-American city before; they were familiar with the Far East and\nthe Mediterranean, but not with the fierce, hot tropics of their sister\ncontinent, and so their eyes were wide open, and they kept calling\ncontinually to one another to notice some new place or figure.\n\nThey in their turn did not escape from notice or comment.  The two\nsisters would have been conspicuous anywhere--in a queen's drawing-room\nor on an Indian reservation.  Theirs was a type that the caballeros and\nsenoritas did not know.  With them dark hair was always associated with\ndark complexions, the rich duskiness of which was always vulgarized by\na coat of powder, and this fair blending of pink and white skin under\nmasses of black hair was strangely new, so that each of the few women\nwho were to be met on the street turned to look after the carriage,\nwhile the American women admired their mantillas, and felt that the\nstraw sailor-hats they wore had become heavy and unfeminine.\n\nClay was very happy in picking out what was most characteristic and\npicturesque, and every street into which he directed the driver to take\nthem seemed to possess some building or monument that was of peculiar\ninterest.  They did not know that he had mapped out this ride many\ntimes before, and was taking them over a route which he had already\ntravelled with them in imagination. King knew what the capital would be\nlike before he entered it, from his experience of other South American\ncities, but he acted as though it were all new to him, and allowed Clay\nto explain, and to give the reason for those features of the place that\nwere unusual and characteristic.  Clay noticed this and appealed to him\nfrom time to time, when he was in doubt; but the other only smiled back\nand shook his head, as much as to say, \"This is your city; they would\nrather hear about it from you.\"\n\nClay took them to the principal shops, where the two girls held\nwhispered consultations over lace mantillas, which they had at once\ndetermined to adopt, and bought the gorgeous paper fans, covered with\nbrilliant pictures of bull-fighters in suits of silver tinsel; and from\nthese open stores he led them to a dingy little shop, where there was\nold silver and precious hand-painted fans of mother-of-pearl that had\nbeen pawned by families who had risked and lost all in some revolution;\nand then to another shop, where two old maiden ladies made a\nparticularly good guava; and to tobacconists, where the men bought a\nfew of the native cigars, which, as they were a monopoly of the\nGovernment, were as bad as Government monopolies always are.\n\nClay felt a sudden fondness for the city, so grateful was he to it for\nentertaining her as it did, and for putting its best front forward for\nher delectation.  He wanted to thank some one for building the quaint\nold convent, with its yellow walls washed to an orange tint, and black\nin spots with dampness; and for the fountain covered with green moss\nthat stood before its gate, and around which were gathered the girls\nand women of the neighborhood with red water-jars on their shoulders,\nand little donkeys buried under stacks of yellow sugar-cane, and the\nnegro drivers of the city's green water-carts, and the blue wagons that\ncarried the manufactured ice.  Toward five o'clock they decided to\nspend the rest of the day in the city, and to telephone for the two\nboys to join them at La Venus, the great restaurant on the plaza, where\nClay had invited them to dine.\n\nHe suggested that they should fill out the time meanwhile by a call on\nthe President, and after a search for cards in various pocketbooks,\nthey drove to the Government palace, which stood in an open square in\nthe heart of the city.\n\nAs they arrived the President and his wife were leaving for their\nafternoon drive on the Alameda, the fashionable parade-ground of the\ncity, and the state carriage and a squad of cavalry appeared from the\nside of the palace as the visitors drove up to the entrance.  But at\nthe sight of Clay, General Alvarez and his wife retreated to the house\nagain and made them welcome.  The President led the men into his\nreception-room and entertained them with champagne and cigarettes, not\nmanufactured by his Government; and his wife, after first conducting\nthe girls through the state drawing-room, where the late sunlight shone\ngloomily on strange old portraits of assassinated presidents and\nvictorious generals, and garish yellow silk furniture, brought them to\nher own apartments, and gave them tea after a civilized fashion, and\nshowed them how glad she was to see some one of her own world again.\n\nDuring their short visit Madame Alvarez talked a greater part of the\ntime herself, addressing what she said to Miss Langham, but looking at\nHope.  It was unusual for Hope to be singled out in this way when her\nsister was present, and both the sisters noticed it and spoke of it\nafterwards.  They thought Madame Alvarez very beautiful and\ndistinguished-looking, and she impressed them, even after that short\nknowledge of her, as a woman of great force of character.\n\n\"She was very well dressed for a Spanish woman,\" was Miss Langham's\ncomment, later in the afternoon.  \"But everything she had on was just a\nyear behind the fashions, or twelve steamer days behind, as Mr.\nMacWilliams puts it.\"\n\n\"She reminded me,\" said Hope, \"of a black panther I saw once in a\ncircus.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed the sister, \"I don't see that at all. Why?\"\n\nHope said she did not know why; she was not given to analyzing her\nimpressions or offering reasons for them.  \"Because the panther looked\nso unhappy,\" she explained, doubtfully, \"and restless; and he kept\npacing up and down all the time, and hitting his head against the bars\nas he walked as though he liked the pain.  Madame Alvarez seemed to me\nto be just like that--as though she were shut up somewhere and wanted\nto be free.\"\n\nWhen Madame Alvarez and the two sisters had joined the men, they all\nwalked together to the terrace, and the visitors waited until the\nPresident and his wife should take their departure.  Hope noticed, in\nadvance of the escort of native cavalry, an auburn-haired, fair-skinned\nyoung man who was sitting an English saddle.\n\nThe officer's eyes were blue and frank and attractive-looking, even as\nthey then were fixed ahead of him with a military lack of expression;\nbut he came to life very suddenly when the President called to him, and\nprodded his horse up to the steps and dismounted.  He was introduced by\nAlvarez as \"Captain Stuart of my household troops, late of the Gordon\nHighlanders.  Captain Stuart,\" said the President, laying his hand\naffectionately on the younger man's epaulette, \"takes care of my life\nand the safety of my home and family.  He could have the command of the\narmy if he wished; but no, he is fond of us, and he tells me we are in\nmore need of protection from our friends at home than from our enemies\non the frontier.  Perhaps he knows best.  I trust him, Mr. Langham,\"\nadded the President, solemnly, \"as I trust no other man in all this\ncountry.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to meet Captain Stuart, I am sure,\" said Mr. Langham,\nsmiling, and appreciating how the shyness of the Englishman must be\nsuffering under the praises of the Spaniard. And Stuart was indeed so\nembarrassed that he flushed under his tan, and assured Clay, while\nshaking hands with them all, that he was delighted to make his\nacquaintance; at which the others laughed, and Stuart came to himself\nsufficiently to laugh with them, and to accept Clay's invitation to\ndine with them later.\n\nThey found the two boys waiting in the café of the restaurant where\nthey had arranged to meet, and they ascended the steps together to the\ntable on the balcony that Clay had reserved for them.\n\nThe young engineer appeared at his best as host.  The responsibility of\nseeing that a half-dozen others were amused and content sat well upon\nhim; and as course followed course, and the wines changed, and the\ncandles left the rest of the room in darkness and showed only the table\nand the faces around it, they all became rapidly more merry and the\nconversation intimately familiar.\n\nClay knew the kind of table-talk to which the Langhams were accustomed,\nand used the material around his table in such a way that the talk\nthere was vastly different.  From King he drew forth tales of the\nburied cities he had first explored, and then robbed of their ugliest\nidols.  He urged MacWilliams to tell carefully edited stories of life\nalong the Chagres before the Scandal came, and of the fastnesses of the\nAndes; and even Stuart grew braver and remembered \"something of the\nsame sort\" he had seen at Fort Nilt, in Upper Burma.\n\n\"Of course,\" was Clay's comment at the conclusion of one of these\nnarratives, \"being an Englishman, Stuart left out the point of the\nstory, which was that he blew in the gates of the fort with a charge of\ndynamite.  He got a D. S. O. for doing it.\"\n\n\"Being an Englishman,\" said Hope, smiling encouragingly on the\nconscious Stuart, \"he naturally would leave that out.\"\n\nMr. Langham and his daughters formed an eager audience.  They had never\nbefore met at one table three men who had known such experiences, and\nwho spoke of them as though they must be as familiar in the lives of\nthe others as in their own--men who spoiled in the telling stories that\nwould have furnished incidents for melodramas, and who impressed their\nhearers more with what they left unsaid, and what was only suggested,\nthan what in their view was the most important point.\n\nThe dinner came to an end at last, and Mr. Langham proposed that they\nshould go down and walk with the people in the plaza; but his two\ndaughters preferred to remain as spectators on the balcony, and Clay\nand Stuart stayed with them.\n\n\"At last!\" sighed Clay, under his breath, seating himself at Miss\nLangham's side as she sat leaning forward with her arms upon the\nrailing and looking down into the plaza below.  She made no sign at\nfirst that she had heard him, but as the voices of Stuart and Hope rose\nfrom the other end of the balcony she turned her head and asked, \"Why\nat last?\"\n\n\"Oh, you couldn't understand,\" laughed Clay.  \"You have not been\nlooking forward to just one thing and then had it come true. It is the\nonly thing that ever did come true to me, and I thought it never would.\"\n\n\"You don't try to make me understand,\" said the girl, smiling, but\nwithout turning her eyes from the moving spectacle below her.  Clay\nconsidered her challenge silently.  He did not know just how much it\nmight mean from her, and the smile robbed it of all serious intent; so\nhe, too, turned and looked down into the great square below them,\ncontent, now that she was alone with him, to take his time.\n\nAt one end of the plaza the President's band was playing native waltzes\nthat came throbbing through the trees and beating softly above the\nrustling skirts and clinking spurs of the senoritas and officers,\nsweeping by in two opposite circles around the edges of the tessellated\npavements.  Above the palms around the square arose the dim, white\nfacade of the cathedral, with the bronze statue of Anduella, the\nliberator of Olancho, who answered with his upraised arm and cocked hat\nthe cheers of an imaginary populace.  Clay's had been an unobtrusive\npart in the evening's entertainment, but he saw that the others had\nbeen pleased, and felt a certain satisfaction in thinking that King\nhimself could not have planned and carried out a dinner more admirable\nin every way.  He was gratified that they should know him to be not\naltogether a barbarian.  But what he best liked to remember was that\nwhenever he had spoken she had listened, even when her eyes were turned\naway and she was pretending to listen to some one else.  He tormented\nhimself by wondering whether this was because he interested her only as\na new and strange character, or whether she felt in some way how\neagerly he was seeking her approbation.  For the first time in his life\nhe found himself considering what he was about to say, and he suited it\nfor her possible liking.  It was at least some satisfaction that she\nhad, if only for the time being, singled him out as of especial\ninterest, and he assured himself that the fault would be his if her\ninterest failed.  He no longer looked on himself as an outsider.\n\nStuart's voice arose from the farther end of the balcony, where the\nwhite figure of Hope showed dimly in the darkness.\n\n\"They are talking about you over there,\" said Miss Langham, turning\ntoward him.\n\n\"Well, I don't mind,\" answered Clay, \"as long as they talk about\nme--over there.\"\n\nMiss Langham shook her head.  \"You are very frank and audacious,\" she\nreplied, doubtfully, \"but it is rather pleasant as a change.\"\n\n\"I don't call that audacious, to say I don't want to be interrupted\nwhen I am talking to you.  Aren't the men you meet generally\naudacious?\" he asked.  \"I can see why not--though,\" he continued, \"you\nawe them.\"\n\n\"I can't think that's a nice way to affect people,\" protested Miss\nLangham, after a pause.  \"I don't awe you, do I?\"\n\n\"Oh, you affect me in many different ways,\" returned Clay, cheerfully.\n\"Sometimes I am very much afraid of you, and then again my feelings are\nonly those of unlimited admiration.\"\n\n\"There, again, what did I tell you?\" said Miss Langham.\n\n\"Well, I can't help doing that,\" said Clay.  \"That is one of the few\nprivileges that is left to a man in my position--it doesn't matter what\nI say.  That is the advantage of being of no account and hopelessly\ndetrimental.  The eligible men of the world, you see, have to be so\nvery careful.  A Prime Minister, for instance, can't talk as he wishes,\nand call names if he wants to, or write letters, even.  Whatever he\nsays is so important, because he says it, that he must be very\ndiscreet.  I am so unimportant that no one minds what I say, and so I\nsay it.  It's the only comfort I have.\"\n\n\"Are you in the habit of going around the world saying whatever you\nchoose to every woman you happen to--to--\" Miss Langham hesitated.\n\n\"To admire very much,\" suggested Clay.\n\n\"To meet,\" corrected Miss Langham.  \"Because, if you are, it is a very\ndangerous and selfish practice, and I think your theory of\nnon-responsibility is a very wicked one.\"\n\n\"Well, I wouldn't say it to a child,\" mused Clay, \"but to one who must\nhave heard it before--\"\n\n\"And who, you think, would like to hear it again, perhaps,\" interrupted\nMiss Langham.\n\n\"No, not at all,\" said Clay.  \"I don't say it to give her pleasure, but\nbecause it gives me pleasure to say what I think.\"\n\n\"If we are to continue good friends, Mr. Clay,\" said Miss Langham, in\ndecisive tones, \"we must keep our relationship on more of a social and\nless of a personal basis.  It was all very well that first night I met\nyou,\" she went on, in a kindly tone.\n\n\"You rushed in then and by a sort of tour de force made me think a\ngreat deal about myself and also about you.  Your stories of cherished\nphotographs and distant devotion and all that were very interesting;\nbut now we are to be together a great deal, and if we are to talk about\nourselves all the time, I for one shall grow very tired of it.  As a\nmatter of fact you don't know what your feelings are concerning me, and\nuntil you do we will talk less about them and more about the things you\nare certain of. When are you going to take us to the mines, for\ninstance, and who was Anduella, the Liberator of Olancho, on that\npedestal over there?  Now, isn't that much more instructive?\"\n\nClay smiled grimly and made no answer, but sat with knitted brows\nlooking out across the trees of the plaza.  His face was so serious and\nhe was apparently giving such earnest consideration to what she had\nsaid that Miss Langham felt an uneasy sense of remorse.  And, moreover,\nthe young man's profile, as he sat looking away from her, was very\nfine, and the head on his broad shoulders was as well-modelled as the\nhead of an Athenian statue.\n\nMiss Langham was not insensible to beauty of any sort, and she regarded\nthe profile with perplexity and with a softening spirit.\n\n\"You understand,\" she said, gently, being quite certain that she did\nnot understand this new order of young man herself. \"You are not\noffended with me?\" she asked.\n\nClay turned and frowned, and then smiled in a puzzled way and stretched\nout his hand toward the equestrian statue in the plaza.\n\n\"Andulla or Anduella, the Treaty-Maker, as they call him, was born in\n1700,\" he said; \"he was a most picturesque sort of a chap, and freed\nthis country from the yoke of Spain.  One of the stories they tell of\nhim gives you a good idea of his character.\"  And so, without any\nchange of expression or reference to what had just passed between them,\nClay continued through the remainder of their stay on the balcony to\ndiscourse in humorous, graphic phrases on the history of Olancho, its\nheroes, and its revolutions, the buccaneers and pirates of the old\ndays, and the concession-hunters and filibusters of the present.  It\nwas some time before Miss Langham was able to give him her full\nattention, for she was considering whether he could be so foolish as to\nhave taken offence at what she said, and whether he would speak of it\nagain, and in wondering whether a personal basis for conversation was\nnot, after all, more entertaining than anecdotes of the victories and\nheroism of dead and buried Spaniards.\n\n\"That Captain Stuart,\" said Hope to her sister, as they drove home\ntogether through the moonlight, \"I like him very much.  He seems to\nhave such a simple idea of what is right and good.  It is like a child\ntalking.  Why, I am really much older than he is in everything but\nyears--why is that?\"\n\n\"I suppose it's because we always talk before you as though you were a\ngrown-up person,\" said her sister.  \"But I agree with you about Captain\nStuart; only, why is he down here?  If he is a gentleman, why is he not\nin his own army?  Was he forced to leave it?\"\n\n\"Oh, he seems to have a very good position here,\" said Mr. Langham.\n\"In England, at his age, he would be only a second-lieutenant.  Don't\nyou remember what the President said, that he would trust him with the\ncommand of his army?  That's certainly a responsible position, and it\nshows great confidence in him.\"\n\n\"Not so great, it seems to me,\" said King, carelessly, \"as he is\nshowing him in making him the guardian of his hearth and home. Did you\nhear what he said to-day?  'He guards my home and my family.'  I don't\nthink a man's home and family are among the things he can afford to\nleave to the protection of stray English subalterns.  From all I hear,\nit would be better if President Alvarez did less plotting and protected\nhis own house himself.\"\n\n\"The young man did not strike me as the sort of person,\" said Mr.\nLangham, warmly, \"who would be likely to break his word to the man who\nis feeding him and sheltering him, and whose uniform he wears.  I don't\nthink the President's home is in any danger from within.  Madame\nAlvarez--\"\n\nClay turned suddenly in his place on the box-seat of the carriage,\nwhere he had been sitting, a silent, misty statue in the moonlight, and\npeered down on those in the carriage below him.\n\n\"Madame Alvarez needs no protection, as you were about to say, Mr.\nLangham,\" he interrupted, quickly.  \"Those who know her could say\nnothing against her, and those who do not know her would not so far\nforget themselves as to dare to do it.  Have you noticed the effect of\nthe moonlight on the walls of the convent?\" he continued, gently.  \"It\nmakes them quite white.\"\n\n\"No,\" exclaimed Mr. Langham and King, hurriedly, as they both turned\nand gazed with absorbing interest at the convent on the hills above\nthem.\n\nBefore the sisters went to sleep that night Hope came to the door of\nher sister's room and watched Alice admiringly as she sat before the\nmirror brushing out her hair.\n\n\"I think it's going to be fine down here; don't you, Alice?\" she asked.\n\"Everything is so different from what it is at home, and so beautiful,\nand I like the men we've met.  Isn't that Mr. MacWilliams funny--and he\nis so tough.  And Captain Stuart--it is a pity he's shy.  The only\nthing he seems to be able to talk about is Mr. Clay.  He worships Mr.\nClay!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" assented her sister, \"I noticed on the balcony that you seemed\nto have found some way to make him speak.\"\n\n\"Well, that was it.  He likes to talk about Mr. Clay, and I wanted to\nlisten.  Oh! he is a fine man.  He has done more exciting things--\"\n\n\"Who?  Captain Stuart?\"\n\n\"No--Mr. Clay.  He's been in three real wars and about a dozen little\nones, and he's built thousands of miles of railroads, I don't know how\nmany thousands, but Captain Stuart knows; and he built the highest\nbridge in Peru.  It swings in the air across a chasm, and it rocks when\nthe wind blows.  And the German Emperor made him a Baron.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I couldn't understand.  It was something about plans\nfor fortifications.  He, Mr. Clay, put up a fort in the harbor of Rio\nJaneiro during a revolution, and the officers on a German man-of-war\nsaw it and copied the plans, and the Germans built one just like it,\nonly larger, on the Baltic, and when the Emperor found out whose design\nit was, he sent Mr. Clay the order of something-or-other, and made him\na Baron.\"\n\n\"Really,\" exclaimed the elder sister, \"isn't he afraid that some one\nwill marry him for his title?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, you can laugh, but I think it's pretty fine, and so does\nTed,\" added Hope, with the air of one who propounds a final argument.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon,\" laughed Alice.  \"If Ted approves we must all\ngo down and worship.\"\n\n\"And father, too,\" continued Hope.  \"He said he thought Mr. Clay was\none of the most remarkable men for his years that he had ever met.\"\n\nMiss Langham's eyes were hidden by the masses of her black hair that\nshe had shaken over her face, and she said nothing.\n\n\"And I liked the way he shut Reggie King up too,\" continued Hope,\nstoutly, \"when he and father were talking that way about Madame\nAlvarez.\"\n\n\"Yes, upon my word,\" exclaimed her sister, impatiently tossing her hair\nback over her shoulders.  \"I really cannot see that Madame Alvarez is\nin need of any champion.  I thought Mr. Clay made it very much worse by\nrushing in the way he did.  Why should he take it upon himself to\ncorrect a man as old as my father?\"\n\n\"I suppose because Madame Alvarez is a friend of his,\" Hope answered.\n\n\"My dear child, a beautiful woman can always find some man to take her\npart,\" said Miss Langham.  \"But I've no doubt,\" she added, rising and\nkissing her sister good-night, \"that he is all that your Captain Stuart\nthinks him; but he is not going to keep us awake any longer, is he,\neven if he does show such gallant interest in old ladies?\"\n\n\"Old ladies!\" exclaimed Hope in amazement.\n\n\"Why, Alice!\"\n\nBut her sister only laughed and waved her out of the room, and Hope\nwalked away frowning in much perplexity.\n\n\n\nV\n\nThe visit to the city was imitated on the three succeeding evenings by\nsimilar excursions.  On one night they returned to the plaza, and the\nother two were spent in drifting down the harbor and along the coast on\nKing's yacht.  The President and Madame Alvarez were King's guests on\none of these moonlight excursions, and were saluted by the proper\nnumber of guns, and their native band played on the forward deck.  Clay\nfelt that King held the centre of the stage for the time being, and\nobliterated himself completely.  He thought of his own paddle-wheel\ntug-boat that he had had painted and gilded in her honor, and smiled\ngrimly.\n\nMacWilliams approached him as he sat leaning back on the rail and\nlooking up, with the eye of a man who had served before the mast, at\nthe lacework of spars and rigging above him.  MacWilliams came toward\nhim on tiptoe and dropped carefully into a wicker chair. \"There don't\nseem to be any door-mats on this boat,\" he said. \"In every other\nrespect she seems fitted out quite complete; all the latest magazines\nand enamelled bathtubs, and Chinese waiter-boys with cock-tails up\ntheir sleeves.  But there ought to be a mat at the top of each of those\nstairways that hang over the side, otherwise some one is sure to soil\nthe deck.  Have you been down in the engine-room yet?\" he asked. \"Well,\ndon't go, then,\" he advised, solemnly.  \"It will only make you feel\nbadly.  I have asked the Admiral if I can send those half-breed engine\ndrivers over to-morrow to show them what a clean engine-room looks\nlike.  I've just been talking to the chief.  His name's MacKenzie, and\nI told him I was Scotch myself, and he said it 'was a greet pleesure'\nto find a gentleman so well acquainted with the movements of machinery.\nHe thought I was one of King's friends, I guess, so I didn't tell him I\npulled a lever for a living myself.  I gave him a cigar though, and he\nsaid, 'Thankee, sir,' and touched his cap to me.\"\n\nMacWilliams chuckled at the recollection, and crossed his legs\ncomfortably.  \"One of King's cigars, too,\" he said.  \"Real Havana; he\nleaves them lying around loose in the cabin.  Have you had one?  Ted\nLangham and I took about a box between us.\"\n\nClay made no answer, and MacWilliams settled himself contentedly in the\ngreat wicker chair and puffed grandly on a huge cigar.\n\n\"It's demoralizing, isn't it?\" he said at last.\n\n\"What?\" asked Clay, absently.\n\n\"Oh, this associating with white people again, as we're doing now.  It\nspoils you for tortillas and rice, doesn't it?  It's going to be great\nfun while it lasts, but when they've all gone, and Ted's gone, too, and\nthe yacht's vanished, and we fall back to tramping around the plaza\ntwice a week, it won't be gay, will it?  No; it won't be gay.  We're\nhaving the spree of our lives now, I guess, but there's going to be a\ndifference in the morning.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's worth a headache, I think,\" said Clay, as he shrugged his\nshoulders and walked away to find Miss Langham.\n\nThe day set for the visit to the mines rose bright and clear.\nMacWilliams had rigged out his single passenger-car with rugs and\ncushions, and flags flew from its canvas top that flapped and billowed\nin the wind of the slow-moving train.  Their observation-car, as\nMacWilliams termed it, was placed in front of the locomotive, and they\nwere pushed gently along the narrow rails between forests of Manaca\npalms, and through swamps and jungles, and at times over the limestone\nformation along the coast, where the waves dashed as high as the\nsmokestack of the locomotive, covering the excursionists with a\nsprinkling of white spray.  Thousands of land-crabs, painted red and\nblack and yellow, scrambled with a rattle like dead men's bones across\nthe rails to be crushed by the hundreds under the wheels of the\nJuggernaut; great lizards ran from sunny rocks at the sound of their\napproach, and a deer bounded across the tracks fifty feet in front of\nthe cow-catcher.  MacWilliams escorted Hope out into the cab of the\nlocomotive, and taught her how to increase and slacken the speed of the\nengine, until she showed an unruly desire to throw the lever open\naltogether and shoot them off the rails into the ocean beyond.\n\nClay sat at the back of the car with Miss Langham, and told her and her\nfather of the difficulties with which young MacWilliams had had to\ncontend.  Miss Langham found her chief pleasure in noting the attention\nwhich her father gave to all that Clay had to tell him.  Knowing her\nfather as she did, and being familiar with his manner toward other men,\nshe knew that he was treating Clay with unusual consideration.  And\nthis pleased her greatly, for it justified her own interest in him.\nShe regarded Clay as a discovery of her own, but she was glad to have\nher opinion of him shared by others.\n\nTheir coming was a great event in the history of the mines. Kirkland,\nthe foreman, and Chapman, who handled the dynamite, Weimer, the Consul,\nand the native doctor, who cared for the fever-stricken and the\ncasualties, were all at the station to meet them in the whitest of\nwhite duck and with a bunch of ponies to carry them on their tour of\ninspection, and the village of mud-cabins and zinc-huts that stood\nclear of the bare sunbaked earth on whitewashed wooden piles was as\nclean as Clay's hundred policemen could sweep it.  Mr. Langham rode in\nadvance of the cavalcade, and the head of each of the different\ndepartments took his turn in riding at his side, and explained what had\nbeen done, and showed him the proud result.  The village was empty,\nexcept for the families of the native workmen and the ownerless dogs,\nthe scavengers of the colony, that snarled and barked and ran leaping\nin front of the ponies' heads.\n\nRising abruptly above the zinc village, lay the first of the five great\nhills, with its open front cut into great terraces, on which the men\nclung like flies on the side of a wall, some of them in groups around\nan opening, or in couples pounding a steel bar that a fellow-workman\nturned in his bare hands, while others gathered about the panting\nsteam-drills that shook the solid rock with fierce, short blows, and\nhid the men about them in a throbbing curtain of steam.  Self-important\nlittle dummy-engines, dragging long trains of ore-cars, rolled and\nrocked on the uneven surface of the ground, and swung around corners\nwith warning screeches of their whistles.  They could see, on peaks\noutlined against the sky, the signal-men waving their red flags, and\nthen plunging down the mountain-side out of danger, as the earth\nrumbled and shook and vomited out a shower of stones and rubbish into\nthe calm hot air.  It was a spectacle of desperate activity and\npuzzling to the uninitiated, for it seemed to be scattered over an\nunlimited extent, with no head nor direction, and with each man, or\neach group of men, working alone, like rag-pickers on a heap of ashes.\n\nAfter the first half-hour of curious interest Miss Langham admitted to\nherself that she was disappointed.  She confessed she had hoped that\nClay would explain the meaning of the mines to her, and act as her\nescort over the mountains which he was blowing into pieces.\n\nBut it was King, somewhat bored by the ceaseless noise and heat, and\nher brother, incoherently enthusiastic, who rode at her side, while\nClay moved on in advance and seemed to have forgotten her existence.\nShe watched him pointing up at the openings in the mountains and down\nat the ore-road, or stooping to pick up a piece of ore from the ground\nin cowboy fashion, without leaving his saddle, and pounding it on the\npommel before he passed it to the others.  And, again, he would stand\nfor minutes at a time up to his boot-tops in the sliding waste, with\nhis bridle rein over his arm and his thumbs in his belt, listening to\nwhat his lieutenants were saying, and glancing quickly from them to Mr.\nLangham to see if he were following the technicalities of their speech.\nAll of the men who had welcomed the appearance of the women on their\narrival with such obvious delight and with so much embarrassment seemed\nnow as oblivious of their presence as Clay himself.\n\nMiss Langham pushed her horse up into the group beside Hope, who had\nkept her pony close at Clay's side from the beginning; but she could\nnot make out what it was they were saying, and no one seemed to think\nit necessary to explain.  She caught Clay's eye at last and smiled\nbrightly at him; but, after staring at her for fully a minute, until\nKirkland had finished speaking, she heard him say, \"Yes, that's it\nexactly; in open-face workings there is no other way,\" and so showed\nher that he had not been even conscious of her presence.  But a few\nminutes later she saw him look up at Hope, folding his arms across his\nchest tightly and shaking his head.  \"You see it was the only thing to\ndo,\" she heard him say, as though he were defending some course of\naction, and as though Hope were one of those who must be convinced.\n\"If we had cut the opening on the first level, there was the danger of\nthe whole thing sinking in, so we had to begin to clear away at the top\nand work down.  That's why I ordered the bucket-trolley.  As it turned\nout, we saved money by it.\"\n\nHope nodded her head slightly.  \"That's what I told father when Ted\nwrote us about it,\" she said; \"but you haven't done it at Mount\nWashington.\"\n\n\"Oh, but it's like this, Miss--\" Kirkland replied, eagerly. \"It's\nbecause Washington is a solider foundation.  We can cut openings all\nover it and they won't cave, but this hill is most all rubbish; it's\nthe poorest stuff in the mines.\"\n\nHope nodded her head again and crowded her pony on after the moving\ngroup, but her sister and King did not follow.  King looked at her and\nsmiled.  \"Hope is very enthusiastic,\" he said.  \"Where did she pick it\nup?\"\n\n\"Oh, she and father used to go over it in his study last winter after\nTed came down here,\" Miss Langham answered, with a touch of impatience\nin her tone.  \"Isn't there some place where we can go to get out of\nthis heat?\"\n\nWeimer, the Consul, heard her and led her back to Kirkland's bungalow,\nthat hung like an eagle's nest from a projecting cliff. From its porch\nthey could look down the valley over the greater part of the mines, and\nbeyond to where the Caribbean Sea lay flashing in the heat.\n\n\"I saw very few Americans down there, Weimer,\" said King.  \"I thought\nClay had imported a lot of them.\"\n\n\"About three hundred altogether, wild Irishmen and negroes,\" said the\nConsul; \"but we use the native soldiers chiefly.  They can stand the\nclimate better, and, besides,\" he added, \"they act as a reserve in case\nof trouble.  They are Mendoza's men, and Clay is trying to win them\naway from him.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said King.\n\nWeimer looked around him and waited until Kirkland's servant had\ndeposited a tray full of bottles and glasses on a table near them, and\nhad departed.  \"The talk is,\" he said, \"that Alvarez means to proclaim\na dictatorship in his own favor before the spring elections.  You've\nheard of that, haven't you?\" King shook his head.\n\n\"Oh, tell us about it,\" said Miss Langham; \"I should so like to be in\nplots and conspiracies.\"\n\n\"Well, they're rather common down here,\" continued the Consul, \"but\nthis one ought to interest you especially, Miss Langham, because it is\na woman who is at the head of it.  Madame Alvarez, you know, was the\nCountess Manueleta Hernandez before her marriage.  She belongs to one\nof the oldest families in Spain.  Alvarez married her in Madrid, when\nhe was Minister there, and when he returned to run for President, she\ncame with him.  She's a tremendously ambitious woman, and they do say\nshe wants to convert the republic into a monarchy, and make her husband\nKing, or, more properly speaking, make herself Queen.  Of course that's\nabsurd, but she is supposed to be plotting to turn Olancho into a sort\nof dependency of Spain, as it was long ago, and that's why she is so\nunpopular.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" interrupted Miss Langham, \"I did not know that she was\nunpopular.\"\n\n\"Oh, rather.  Why, her party is called the Royalist Party already, and\nonly a week before you came the Liberals plastered the city with\ndenunciatory placards against her, calling on the people to drive her\nout of the country.\"\n\n\"What cowards--to fight a woman!\" exclaimed Miss Langham.\n\n\"Well, she began it first, you see,\" said the Consul.\n\n\"Who is the leader of the fight against her?\" asked King.\n\n\"General Mendoza; he is commander-in-chief and has the greater part of\nthe army with him, but the other candidate, old General Rojas, is the\npopular choice and the best of the three. He is Vice-President now, and\nif the people were ever given a fair chance to vote for the man they\nwant, he would unquestionably be the next President.  The mass of the\npeople are sick of revolutions.  They've had enough of them, but they\nwill have to go through another before long, and if it turns against\nDr. Alvarez, I'm afraid Mr. Langham will have hard work to hold these\nmines.  You see, Mendoza has already threatened to seize the whole\nplant and turn it into a Government monopoly.\"\n\n\"And if the other one, General Rojas, gets into power, will he seize\nthe mines, too?\"\n\n\"No, he is honest, strange to relate,\" laughed Weimer, \"but he won't\nget in.  Alvarez will make himself dictator, or Mendoza will make\nhimself President.  That's why Clay treats the soldiers here so well.\nHe thinks he may need them against Mendoza.  You may be turning your\nsaluting-gun on the city yet, Commodore,\" he added, smiling, \"or, what\nis more likely, you'll need the yacht to take Miss Langham and the rest\nof the family out of the country.\"\n\nKing smiled and Miss Langham regarded Weimer with flattering interest.\n\"I've got a quick firing gun below decks,\" said King, \"that I used in\nthe Malaysian Peninsula on a junkful of Black Flags, and I think I'll\nhave it brought up.  And there are about thirty of my men on the yacht\nwho wouldn't ask for their wages in a year if I'd let them go on shore\nand mix up in a fight.  When do you suppose this--\"\n\nA heavy step and the jingle of spurs on the bare floor of the bungalow\nstartled the conspirators, and they turned and gazed guiltily out at\nthe mountain-tops above them as Clay came hurrying out upon the porch.\n\n\"They told me you were here,\" he said, speaking to Miss Langham.  \"I'm\nso sorry it tired you.  I should have remembered--it is a rough trip\nwhen you're not used to it,\" he added, remorsefully.  \"But I'm glad\nWeimer was here to take care of you.\"\n\n\"It was just a trifle hot and noisy,\" said Miss Langham, smiling\nsweetly.  She put her hand to her forehead with an expression of\npatient suffering.  \"It made my head ache a little, but it was most\ninteresting.\"  She added, \"You are certainly to be congratulated on\nyour work.\"\n\nClay glanced at her doubtfully with a troubled look, and turned away\nhis eyes to the busy scene below him.  He was greatly hurt that she\nshould have cared so little, and indignant at himself for being so\nunjust.  Why should he expect a woman to find interest in that hive of\nnoise and sweating energy?  But even as he stood arguing with himself\nhis eyes fell on a slight figure sitting erect and graceful on her\npony's back, her white habit soiled and stained red with the ore of the\nmines, and green where it had crushed against the leaves.  She was\ncoming slowly up the trail with a body-guard of half a dozen men\ncrowding closely around her, telling her the difficulties of the work,\nand explaining their successes, and eager for a share of her quick\nsympathy.\n\nClay's eyes fixed themselves on the picture, and he smiled at its\nsignificance.  Miss Langham noticed the look, and glanced below to see\nwhat it was that had so interested him, and then back at him again.  He\nwas still watching the approaching cavalcade intently, and smiling to\nhimself.  Miss Langham drew in her breath and raised her head and\nshoulders quickly, like a deer that hears a footstep in the forest, and\nwhen Hope presently stepped out upon the porch, she turned quickly\ntoward her, and regarded her steadily, as though she were a stranger to\nher, and as though she were trying to see her with the eyes of one who\nlooked at her for the first time.\n\n\"Hope!\" she said, \"do look at your dress!\"\n\nHope's face was glowing with the unusual exercise, and her eyes were\nbrilliant.  Her hair had slipped down beneath the visor of her helmet.\n\n\"I am so tired--and so hungry.\"  She was laughing and looking directly\nat Clay.  \"It has been a wonderful thing to have seen,\" she said,\ntugging at her heavy gauntlet, \"and to have done,\" she added.  She\npulled off her glove and held out her hand to Clay, moist and scarred\nwith the pressure of the reins.\n\n\"Thank you,\" she said, simply.\n\nThe master of the mines took it with a quick rush of gratitude, and\nlooking into the girl's eyes, saw something there that startled him, so\nthat he glanced quickly past her at the circle of booted men grouped in\nthe door behind her.  They were each smiling in appreciation of the\ntableau; her father and Ted, MacWilliams and Kirkland, and all the\nothers who had helped him. They seemed to envy, but not to grudge, the\nwhole credit which the girl had given to him.\n\nClay thought, \"Why could it not have been the other?\"  But he said\naloud, \"Thank YOU.  You have given me my reward.\"\n\nMiss Langham looked down impatiently into the valley below, and found\nthat it seemed more hot and noisy, and more grimy than before.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nClay believed that Alice Langham's visit to the mines had opened his\neyes fully to vast differences between them.  He laughed and railed at\nhimself for having dared to imagine that he was in a position to care\nfor her.  Confident as he was at times, and sure as he was of his\nability in certain directions, he was uneasy and fearful when he\nmatched himself against a man of gentle birth and gentle breeding, and\none who, like King, was part of a world of which he knew little, and to\nwhich, in his ignorance concerning it, he attributed many advantages\nthat it did not possess.  He believed that he would always lack the\nmysterious something which these others held by right of inheritance.\nHe was still young and full of the illusions of youth, and so gave\nfalse values to his own qualities, and values equally false to the\nqualities he lacked.  For the next week he avoided Miss Langham, unless\nthere were other people present, and whenever she showed him special\nfavor, he hastily recalled to his mind her failure to sympathize in his\nwork, and assured himself that if she could not interest herself in the\nengineer, he did not care to have her interested in the man.  Other\nwomen had found him attractive in himself; they had cared for his\nstrength of will and mind, and because he was good to look at.  But he\ndetermined that this one must sympathize with his work in the world, no\nmatter how unpicturesque it might seem to her.  His work was the best\nof him, he assured himself, and he would stand or fall with it.\n\nIt was a week after the visit to the mines that President Alvarez gave\na great ball in honor of the Langhams, to which all of the important\npeople of Olancho, and the Foreign Ministers were invited.  Miss\nLangham met Clay on the afternoon of the day set for the ball, as she\nwas going down the hill to join Hope and her father at dinner on the\nyacht.\n\n\"Are you not coming, too?\" she asked.\n\n\"I wish I could,\" Clay answered.  \"King asked me, but a steamer-load of\nnew machinery arrived to-day, and I have to see it through the\nCustom-House.\"\n\nMiss Langham gave an impatient little laugh, and shook her head. \"You\nmight wait until we were gone before you bother with your machinery,\"\nshe said.\n\n\"When you are gone I won't be in a state of mind to attend to machinery\nor anything else,\" Clay answered.\n\nMiss Langham seemed so far encouraged by this speech that she seated\nherself in the boathouse at the end of the wharf.  She pushed her\nmantilla back from her face and looked up at him, smiling brightly.\n\n\"'The time has come, the walrus said,'\" she quoted, \"'to talk of many\nthings.'\"\n\nClay laughed and dropped down beside her.  \"Well?\" he said.\n\n\"You have been rather unkind to me this last week,\" the girl began,\nwith her eyes fixed steadily on his.  \"And that day at the mines when I\ncounted on you so, you acted abominably.\"\n\nClay's face showed so plainly his surprise at this charge, which he\nthought he only had the right to make, that Miss Langham stopped.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Clay, quietly.  \"How did I treat you\nabominably?\"\n\nHe had taken her so seriously that Miss Langham dropped her lighter\ntone and spoke in one more kindly:\n\n\"I went out there to see your work at its best.  I was only interested\nin going because it was your work, and because it was you who had done\nit all, and I expected that you would try to explain it to me and help\nme to understand, but you didn't.  You treated me as though I had no\ninterest in the matter at all, as though I was not capable of\nunderstanding it.  You did not seem to care whether I was interested or\nnot.  In fact, you forgot me altogether.\"\n\nClay exhibited no evidence of a reproving conscience.  \"I am sorry you\nhad a stupid time,\" he said, gravely.\n\n\"I did not mean that, and you know I didn't mean that,\" the girl\nanswered.  \"I wanted to hear about it from you, because you did it.  I\nwasn't interested so much in what had been done, as I was in the man\nwho had accomplished it.\"\n\nClay shrugged his shoulders impatiently, and looked across at Miss\nLangham with a troubled smile.\n\n\"But that's just what I don't want,\" he said.  \"Can't you see? These\nmines and other mines like them are all I have in the world.  They are\nmy only excuse for having lived in it so long. I want to feel that I've\ndone something outside of myself, and when you say that you like me\npersonally, it's as little satisfaction to me as it must be to a woman\nto be congratulated on her beauty, or on her fine voice.  That is\nnothing she has done herself.  I should like you to value what I have\ndone, not what I happen to be.\"\n\nMiss Langham turned her eyes to the harbor, and it was some short time\nbefore she answered.\n\n\"You are a very difficult person to please,\" she said, \"and most\nexacting.  As a rule men are satisfied to be liked for any reason.  I\nconfess frankly, since you insist upon it, that I do not rise to the\npoint of appreciating your work as the others do.  I suppose it is a\nfault,\" she continued, with an air that plainly said that she\nconsidered it, on the contrary, something of a virtue.  \"And if I knew\nmore about it technically, I might see more in it to admire.  But I am\nlooking farther on for better things from you.  The friends who help us\nthe most are not always those who consider us perfect, are they?\" she\nasked, with a kindly smile.  She raised her eyes to the great ore-pier\nthat stretched out across the water, the one ugly blot in the scene of\nnatural beauty about them.  \"I think that is all very well,\" she said;\n\"but I certainly expect you to do more than that.  I have met many\nremarkable men in all parts of the world, and I know what a strong man\nis, and you have one of the strongest personalities I have known.  But\nyou can't mean that you are content to stop with this.  You should be\nsomething bigger and more wide-reaching and more lasting.  Indeed, it\nhurts me to see you wasting your time here over my father's interests.\nYou should exert that same energy on a broader map.  You could make\nyourself anything you chose.  At home you would be your party's leader\nin politics, or you could be a great general, or a great financier.  I\nsay this because I know there are better things in you, and because I\nwant you to make the most of your talents.  I am anxious to see you put\nyour powers to something worth while.\"\n\nMiss Langham's voice carried with it such a tone of sincerity that she\nalmost succeeded in deceiving herself.  And yet she would have hardly\ncared to explain just why she had reproached the man before her after\nthis fashion.  For she knew that when she spoke as she had done, she\nwas beating about to find some reason that would justify her in not\ncaring for him, as she knew she could care--as she would not allow\nherself to care.  The man at her side had won her interest from the\nfirst, and later had occupied her thoughts so entirely, that it\ntroubled her peace of mind.  Yet she would not let her feeling for him\nwax and grow stronger, but kept it down.  And she was trying now to\npersuade herself that she did this because there was something lacking\nin him and not in her.\n\nShe was almost angry with him for being so much to her and for not\nbeing more acceptable in little things, like the other men she knew.\nSo she found this fault with him in order that she might justify her\nown lack of feeling.\n\nBut Clay, who only heard the words and could not go back of them to\nfind the motive, could not know this.  He sat perfectly still when she\nhad finished and looked steadily out across the harbor.  His eyes fell\non the ugly ore-pier, and he winced and uttered a short grim laugh.\n\n\"That's true, what you say,\" he began, \"I haven't done much. You are\nquite right.  Only--\" he looked up at her curiously and smiled--\"only\nyou should not have been the one to tell me of it.\"\n\nMiss Langham had been so far carried away by her own point of view that\nshe had not considered Clay, and now that she saw what mischief she had\ndone, she gave a quick gasp of regret, and leaned forward as though to\nadd some explanation to what she had said.  But Clay stopped her.  \"I\nmean by that,\" he said, \"that the great part of the inspiration I have\nhad to do what little I have done came from you.  You were a sort of\npromise of something better to me.  You were more of a type than an\nindividual woman, but your picture, the one I carry in my watch, meant\nall that part of life that I have never known, the sweetness and the\nnobleness and grace of civilization,--something I hoped I would some\nday have time to enjoy.  So you see,\" he added, with an uncertain\nlaugh, \"it's less pleasant to hear that I have failed to make the most\nof myself from you than from almost any one else.\"\n\n\"But, Mr. Clay,\" protested the girl, anxiously, \"I think you have done\nwonderfully well.  I only said that I wanted you to do more.  You are\nso young and you have--\"\n\nClay did not hear her.  He was leaning forward looking moodily out\nacross the water, with his folded arms clasped across his knees.\n\n\"I have not made the most of myself,\" he repeated; \"that is what you\nsaid.\"  He spoke the words as though she had delivered a sentence.\n\"You don't think well of what I have done, of what I am.\"\n\nHe drew in his breath and shook his head with a hopeless laugh, and\nleaned back against the railing of the boat-house with the weariness in\nhis attitude of a man who has given up after a long struggle.\n\n\"No,\" he said with a bitter flippancy in his voice, \"I don't amount to\nmuch.  But, my God!\" he laughed, and turning his head away, \"when you\nthink what I was!  This doesn't seem much to you, and it doesn't seem\nmuch to me now that I have your point of view on it, but when I\nremember!\"  Clay stopped again and pressed his lips together and shook\nhis head.  His half-closed eyes, that seemed to be looking back into\nhis past, lighted as they fell on King's white yacht, and he raised his\narm and pointed to it with a wave of the hand.  \"When I was sixteen I\nwas a sailor before the mast,\" he said, \"the sort of sailor that King's\ncrew out there wouldn't recognize in the same profession.  I was of so\nlittle account that I've been knocked the length of the main deck at\nthe end of the mate's fist, and left to lie bleeding in the scuppers\nfor dead.  I hadn't a thing to my name then but the clothes I wore, and\nI've had to go aloft in a hurricane and cling to a swinging rope with\nmy bare toes and pull at a wet sheet until my finger-nails broke and\nstarted in their sockets; and I've been a cowboy, with no companions\nfor six months of the year but eight thousand head of cattle and men as\ndumb and untamed as the steers themselves.  I've sat in my saddle night\nafter night, with nothing overhead but the stars, and no sound but the\nnoise of the steers breathing in their sleep.  The women I knew were\nIndian squaws, and the girls of the sailors' dance-houses and the\ngambling-hells of Sioux City and Abilene, and Callao and Port Said.\nThat was what I was and those were my companions.  Why!\" he laughed,\nrising and striding across the boat-house with his hands locked behind\nhim, \"I've fought on the mud floor of a Mexican shack, with a naked\nknife in my hand, for my last dollar.  I was as low and as desperate as\nthat.  And now--\" Clay lifted his head and smiled.  \"Now,\" he said, in\na lower voice and addressing Miss Langham with a return of his usual\ngrave politeness, \"I am able to sit beside you and talk to you.  I have\nrisen to that.  I am quite content.\"\n\nHe paused and looked at Miss Langham uncertainly for a few moments as\nthough in doubt as to whether she would understand him if he continued.\n\n\"And though it means nothing to you,\" he said, \"and though as you say I\nam here as your father's employee, there are other places, perhaps,\nwhere I am better known.  In Edinburgh or Berlin or Paris, if you were\nto ask the people of my own profession, they could tell you something\nof me.  If I wished it, I could drop this active work tomorrow and\ncontinue as an adviser, as an expert, but I like the active part\nbetter.  I like doing things myself.  I don't say, 'I am a salaried\nservant of Mr. Langham's;' I put it differently.  I say, 'There are\nfive mountains of iron. You are to take them up and transport them from\nSouth America to North America, where they will be turned into\nrailroads and ironclads.'  That's my way of looking at it.  It's better\nto bind a laurel to the plough than to call yourself hard names.  It\nmakes your work easier--almost noble.  Cannot you see it that way, too?\"\n\nBefore Miss Langham could answer, a deprecatory cough from one side of\nthe open boat-house startled them, and turning they saw MacWilliams\ncoming toward them.  They had been so intent upon what Clay was saying\nthat he had approached them over the soft sand of the beach without\ntheir knowing it.  Miss Langham welcomed his arrival with evident\npleasure.\n\n\"The launch is waiting for you at the end of the pier,\" MacWilliams\nsaid.  Miss Langham rose and the three walked together down the length\nof the wharf, MacWilliams moving briskly in advance in order to enable\nthem to continue the conversation he had interrupted, but they followed\nclose behind him, as though neither of them were desirous of such an\nopportunity.\n\nHope and King had both come for Miss Langham, and while the latter was\nhelping her to a place on the cushions, and repeating his regrets that\nthe men were not coming also, Hope started the launch, with a brisk\nringing of bells and a whirl of the wheel and a smile over her shoulder\nat the figures on the wharf.\n\n\"Why didn't you go?\" said Clay; \"you have no business at the\nCustom-House.\"\n\n\"Neither have you,\" said MacWilliams.  \"But I guess we both understand.\nThere's no good pushing your luck too far.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that--this time?\"\n\n\"Why, what have we to do with all of this?\" cried MacWilliams. \"It's\nwhat I keep telling you every day.  We're not in that class, and you're\nonly making it harder for yourself when they've gone.  I call it\ncruelty to animals myself, having women like that around.  Up North,\nwhere everybody's white, you don't notice it so much, but down\nhere--Lord!\"\n\n\"That's absurd,\" Clay answered.  \"Why should you turn your back on\ncivilization when it comes to you, just because you're not going back\nto civilization by the next steamer?  Every person you meet either\nhelps you or hurts you.  Those girls help us, even if they do make the\nlife here seem bare and mean.\"\n\n\"Bare and mean!\" repeated MacWilliams incredulously.  \"I think that's\njust what they don't do.  I like it all the better because they're\nmixed up in it.  I never took so much interest in your mines until she\ntook to riding over them, and I didn't think great shakes of my old\nore-road, either, but now that she's got to acting as engineer, it's\nsort of nickel-plated the whole outfit.  I'm going to name the new\nengine after her--when it gets here--if her old man will let me.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?  Miss Langham hasn't been to the mines but once, has\nshe?\"\n\n\"Miss Langham!\" exclaimed MacWilliams. \"No, I mean the other, Miss\nHope.  She comes out with Ted nearly every day now, and she's learning\nhow to run a locomotive.  Just for fun, you know,\" he added,\nreassuringly.\n\n\"I didn't suppose she had any intention of joining the Brotherhood,\"\nsaid Clay.  \"So she's been out every day, has she?  I like that,\" he\ncommented, enthusiastically.  \"She's a fine, sweet girl.\"\n\n\"Fine, sweet girl!\" growled MacWilliams.  \"I should hope so. She's the\nbest.  They don't make them any better than that, and just think, if\nshe's like that now, what will she be when she's grown up, when she's\nlearned a few things?  Now her sister.  You can see just what her\nsister will be at thirty, and at fifty, and at eighty.  She's\nthoroughbred and she's the most beautiful woman to look at I ever\nsaw--but, my son--she is too careful.  She hasn't any illusions, and no\nsense of humor.  And a woman with no illusions and no sense of humor is\ngoing to be monotonous.  You can't teach her anything.  You can't\nimagine yourself telling her anything she doesn't know.  The things we\nthink important don't reach her at all.  They're not in her line, and\nin everything else she knows more than we could ever guess at.  But\nthat Miss Hope!  It's a privilege to show her about.  She wants to see\neverything, and learn everything, and she goes poking her head into\nopenings and down shafts like a little fox terrier. And she'll sit\nstill and listen with her eyes wide open and tears in them, too, and\nshe doesn't know it--until you can't talk yourself for just looking at\nher.\"\n\nClay rose and moved on to the house in silence.  He was glad that\nMacWilliams had interrupted him when he did.  He wondered whether he\nunderstood Alice Langham after all.  He had seen many fine ladies\nbefore during his brief visits to London, and Berlin, and Vienna, and\nthey had shown him favor.  He had known other women not so fine.\nSpanish-American senoritas through Central and South America, the wives\nand daughters of English merchants exiled along the Pacific coast,\nwhose fair skin and yellow hair whitened and bleached under the hot\ntropical suns.  He had known many women, and he could have quoted\n\n    \"Trials and troubles amany,\n        Have proved me;\n      One or two women, God bless them!\n        Have loved me.\"\n\nBut the woman he was to marry must have all the things he lacked.\n\nShe must fill out and complete him where he was wanting.  This woman\npossessed all of these things.  She appealed to every ambition and to\nevery taste he cherished, and yet he knew that he had hesitated and\nmistrusted her, when he should have declared himself eagerly and\nvehemently, and forced her to listen with all the strength of his will.\n\n\nMiss Langham dropped among the soft cushions of the launch with a sense\nof having been rescued from herself and of delight in finding refuge\nagain in her own environment.  The sight of King standing in the bow\nbeside Hope with his cigarette hanging from his lips, and peering with\nhalf-closed eyes into the fading light, gave her a sense of restfulness\nand content.  She did not know what she wished from that other strange\nyoung man.  He was so bold, so handsome, and he looked at life and\nspoke of it in such a fresh, unhackneyed spirit.  He might make himself\nanything he pleased.  But here was a man who already had everything, or\nwho could get it as easily as he could increase the speed of the\nlaunch, by pulling some wire with his finger.\n\nShe recalled one day when they were all on board of this same launch,\nand the machinery had broken down, and MacWilliams had gone forward to\nlook at it.  He had called Clay to help him, and she remembered how\nthey had both gone down on their knees and asked the engineer and\nfireman to pass them wrenches and oil-cans, while King protested\nmildly, and the rest sat helplessly in the hot glare of the sea, as the\nboat rose and fell on the waves.  She resented Clay's interest in the\naccident, and his pleasure when he had made the machinery right once\nmore, and his appearance as he came back to them with oily hands and\nwith his face glowing from the heat of the furnace, wiping his grimy\nfingers on a piece of packing.  She had resented the equality with\nwhich he treated the engineer in asking his advice, and it rather\nsurprised her that the crew saluted him when he stepped into the launch\nagain that night as though he were the owner.  She had expected that\nthey would patronize him, and she imagined after this incident that she\ndetected a shade of difference in the manner of the sailors toward\nClay, as though he had cheapened himself to them--as he had to her.\n\n\n\nVII\n\nAt ten o'clock that same evening Clay began to prepare himself for the\nball at the Government palace, and MacWilliams, who was not invited,\nwatched him dress with critical approval that showed no sign of envy.\n\nThe better to do honor to the President, Clay had brought out several\nforeign orders, and MacWilliams helped him to tie around his neck the\ncollar of the Red Eagle which the German Emperor had given him, and to\nfasten the ribbon and cross of the Star of Olancho across his breast,\nand a Spanish Order and the Legion of Honor to the lapel of his coat.\nMacWilliams surveyed the effect of the tiny enamelled crosses with his\nhead on one side, and with the same air of affectionate pride and\nconcern that a mother shows over her daughter's first ball-dress.\n\n\"Got any more?\" he asked, anxiously.\n\n\"I have some war medals,\" Clay answered, smiling doubtfully. \"But I'm\nnot in uniform.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" declared MacWilliams.  \"Put 'em on, put 'em all\non.  Give the girls a treat.  Everybody will think they were given for\nfeats of swimming, anyway; but they will show up well from the front.\nNow, then, you look like a drum-major or a conjuring chap.\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said Clay.  \"I look like a French Ambassador, and I hardly\nunderstand how you find courage to speak to me at all.\"\n\nHe went up the hill in high spirits, and found the carriage at the door\nand King, Mr. Langham, and Miss Langham sitting waiting for him.  They\nwere ready to depart, and Miss Langham had but just seated herself in\nthe carriage when they heard hurrying across the tiled floor a quick,\nlight step and the rustle of silk, and turning they saw Hope standing\nin the doorway, radiant and smiling.  She wore a white frock that\nreached to the ground, and that left her arms and shoulders bare.  Her\nhair was dressed high upon her head, and she was pulling vigorously at\na pair of long, tan-colored gloves.  The transformation was so\ncomplete, and the girl looked so much older and so stately and\nbeautiful, that the two young men stared at her in silent admiration\nand astonishment.\n\n\"Why, Hope!\" exclaimed her sister.  \"What does this mean?\"\n\nHope stopped in some alarm, and clasped her hair with both hands.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked; \"is anything wrong?\"\n\n\"Why, my dear child,\" said her sister, \"you're not thinking of going\nwith us, are you?\"\n\n\"Not going?\" echoed the younger sister, in dismay.  \"Why, Alice, why\nnot? I was asked.\"\n\n\"But, Hope-- Father,\" said the elder sister, stepping out of the\ncarriage and turning to Mr. Langham, \"you didn't intend that Hope\nshould go, did you?  She's not out yet.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense,\" said Hope, defiantly.  But she drew in her breath\nquickly and blushed, as she saw the two young men moving away out of\nhearing of this family crisis.  She felt that she was being made to\nlook like a spoiled child.  \"It doesn't count down here,\" she said,\n\"and I want to go.  I thought you knew I was going all the time.  Marie\nmade this frock for me on purpose.\"\n\n\"I don't think Hope is old enough,\" the elder sister said, addressing\nher father, \"and if she goes to dances here, there's no reason why she\nshould not go to those at home.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to go to dances at home,\" interrupted Hope.\n\nMr. Langham looked exceedingly uncomfortable, and turned appealingly to\nhis elder daughter.  \"What do you think, Alice?\" he said, doubtfully.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Miss Langham replied, \"but I know it would not be at all\nproper.  I hate to seem horrid about it, Hope, but indeed you are too\nyoung, and the men here are not the men a young girl ought to meet.\"\n\n\"You meet them, Alice,\" said Hope, but pulling off her gloves in token\nof defeat.\n\n\"But, my dear child, I'm fifty years older than you are.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Alice knows best, Hope,\" Mr. Langham said.  \"I'm sorry if you\nare disappointed.\"\n\nHope held her head a little higher, and turned toward the door.\n\n\"I don't mind if you don't wish it, father,\" she said. \"Good-night.\"\nShe moved away, but apparently thought better of it, and came back and\nstood smiling and nodding to them as they seated themselves in the\ncarriage.  Mr. Langham leaned forward and said, in a troubled voice,\n\"We will tell you all about it in the morning.  I'm very sorry.  You\nwon't be lonely, will you? I'll stay with you if you wish.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" laughed Hope.  \"Why, it's given to you, father; don't\nbother about me.  I'll read something or other and go to bed.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Cinderella,\" King called out to her.\n\n\"Good-night, Prince Charming,\" Hope answered.\n\nBoth Clay and King felt that the girl would not mind missing the ball\nso much as she would the fact of having been treated like a child in\ntheir presence, so they refrained from any expression of sympathy or\nregret, but raised their hats and bowed a little more impressively than\nusual as the carriage drove away.\n\nThe picture Hope made, as she stood deserted and forlorn on the steps\nof the empty house in her new finery, struck Clay as unnecessarily\npathetic.  He felt a strong sense of resentment against her sister and\nher father, and thanked heaven devoutly that he was out of their class,\nand when Miss Langham continued to express her sorrow that she had been\nforced to act as she had done, he remained silent.  It seemed to Clay\nsuch a simple thing to give children pleasure, and to remember that\ntheir woes were always out of all proportion to the cause.  Children,\ndumb animals, and blind people were always grouped together in his mind\nas objects demanding the most tender and constant consideration.  So\nthe pleasure of the evening was spoiled for him while he remembered the\nhurt and disappointed look in Hope's face, and when Miss Langham asked\nhim why he was so preoccupied, he told her bluntly that he thought she\nhad been very unkind to Hope, and that her objections were absurd.\n\nMiss Langham held herself a little more stiffly.  \"Perhaps you do not\nquite understand, Mr. Clay,\" she said.  \"Some of us have to conform to\ncertain rules that the people with whom we best like to associate have\nlaid down for themselves.  If we choose to be conventional, it is\nprobably because we find it makes life easier for the greater number.\nYou cannot think it was a pleasant task for me.  But I have given up\nthings of much more importance than a dance for the sake of\nappearances, and Hope herself will see to-morrow that I acted for the\nbest.\"\n\nClay said he trusted so, but doubted it, and by way of re-establishing\nhimself in Miss Langham's good favor, asked her if she could give him\nthe next dance.  But Miss Langham was not to be propitiated.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"but I believe I am engaged until supper-time.\nCome and ask me then, and I'll have one saved for you.  But there is\nsomething you can do,\" she added.  \"I left my fan in the carriage--do\nyou think you could manage to get it for me without much trouble?\"\n\n\"The carriage did not wait.  I believe it was sent back,\" said Clay,\n\"but I can borrow a horse from one of Stuart's men, and ride back and\nget it for you, if you like.\"\n\n\"How absurd!\" laughed Miss Langham, but she looked pleased,\nnotwithstanding.\n\n\"Oh, not at all,\" Clay answered.  He was smiling down at her in some\namusement, and was apparently much entertained at his idea. \"Will you\nconsider it an act of devotion?\" he asked.\n\nThere was so little of devotion, and so much more of mischief in his\neyes, that Miss Langham guessed he was only laughing at her, and shook\nher head.\n\n\"You won't go,\" she said, turning away.  She followed him with her\neyes, however, as he crossed the room, his head and shoulders towering\nabove the native men and women.  She had never seen him so resplendent,\nand she noted, with an eye that considered trifles, the orders, and his\nwell-fitting white gloves, and his manner of bowing in the Continental\nfashion, holding his opera-hat on his thigh, as though his hand rested\non a sword.  She noticed that the little Olanchoans stopped and looked\nafter him, as he pushed his way among them, and she could see that the\nmen were telling the women who he was.  Sir Julian Pindar, the old\nBritish Minister, stopped him, and she watched them as they laughed\ntogether over the English war medals on the American's breast, which\nSir Julian touched with his finger.  He called the French Minister and\nhis pretty wife to look, too, and they all laughed and talked together\nin great spirits, and Miss Langham wondered if Clay was speaking in\nFrench to them.\n\nMiss Langham did not enjoy the ball; she felt injured and aggrieved,\nand she assured herself that she had been hardly used.\n\nShe had only done her duty, and yet all the sympathy had gone to her\nsister, who had placed her in a trying position.  She thought it was\nmost inconsiderate.\n\nHope walked slowly across the veranda when the others had gone, and\nwatched the carriage as long as it remained in sight.  Then she threw\nherself into a big arm-chair, and looked down upon her pretty frock and\nher new dancing-slippers.  She, too, felt badly used.\n\nThe moonlight fell all about her, as it had on the first night of their\narrival, a month before, but now it seemed cold and cheerless, and gave\nan added sense of loneliness to the silent house.  She did not go\ninside to read, as she had promised to do, but sat for the next hour\nlooking out across the harbor.  She could not blame Alice.  She\nconsidered that Alice always moved by rules and precedents, like a\nqueen in a game of chess, and she wondered why.  It made life so tame\nand uninteresting, and yet people invariably admired Alice, and some\none had spoken of her as the noblest example of the modern gentlewoman.\nShe was sure she could not grow up to be any thing like that.  She was\nquite confident that she was going to disappoint her family.  She\nwondered if people would like her better if she were discreet like\nAlice, and less like her brother Ted.  If Mr. Clay, for instance, would\nlike her better?  She wondered if he disapproved of her riding on the\nengine with MacWilliams, and of her tearing through the mines on her\npony, and spearing with a lance of sugar-cane at the mongrel curs that\nran to snap at his flanks. She remembered his look of astonished\namusement the day he had caught her in this impromptu pig-sticking, and\nshe felt herself growing red at the recollection.  She was sure he\nthought her a tomboy.  Probably he never thought of her at all.\n\nHope leaned back in the chair and looked up at the stars above the\nmountains and tried to think of any of her heroes and princes in\nfiction who had gone through such interesting experiences as had Mr.\nClay.  Some of them had done so, but they were creatures in a book and\nthis hero was alive, and she knew him, and had probably made him\ndespise her as a silly little girl who was scolded and sent off to bed\nlike a disobedient child.  Hope felt a choking in her throat and\nsomething like a tear creep to her eyes: but she was surprised to find\nthat the fact did not make her ashamed of herself.  She owned that she\nwas wounded and disappointed, and to make it harder she could not help\npicturing Alice and Clay laughing and talking together in some corner\naway from the ball-room, while she, who understood him so well, and who\ncould not find the words to tell him how much she valued what he was\nand what he had done, was forgotten and sitting here alone, like\nCinderella, by the empty fireplace.\n\nThe picture was so pathetic as Hope drew it, that for a moment she felt\nalmost a touch of self-pity, but the next she laughed scornfully at her\nown foolishness, and rising with an impatient shrug, walked away in the\ndirection of her room.\n\nBut before she had crossed the veranda she was stopped by the sound of\na horse's hoofs galloping over the hard sun-baked road that led from\nthe city, and before she had stepped forward out of the shadow in which\nshe stood the horse had reached the steps and his rider had pulled him\nback on his haunches and swung himself off before the forefeet had\ntouched the ground.\n\nHope had guessed that it was Clay by his riding, and she feared from\nhis haste that some one of her people were ill.  So she ran anxiously\nforward and asked if anything were wrong.\n\nClay started at her sudden appearance, and gave a short boyish laugh of\npleasure.\n\n\"I'm so glad you're still up,\" he said.  \"No, nothing is wrong.\"  He\nstopped in some embarrassment.  He had been moved to return by the fact\nthat the little girl he knew was in trouble, and now that he was\nsuddenly confronted by this older and statelier young person, his\naction seemed particularly silly, and he was at a loss to explain it in\nany way that would not give offence.\n\n\"No, nothing is wrong,\" he repeated.  \"I came after something.\"\n\nClay had borrowed one of the cloaks the troopers wore at night from the\nsame man who had lent him the horse, and as he stood bareheaded before\nher, with the cloak hanging from his shoulders to the floor and the\nstar and ribbon across his breast, Hope felt very grateful to him for\nbeing able to look like a Prince or a hero in a book, and to yet remain\nher Mr. Clay at the same time.\n\n\"I came to get your sister's fan,\" Clay explained.  \"She forgot it.\"\n\nThe young girl looked at him for a moment in surprise and then\nstraightened herself slightly.  She did not know whether she was the\nmore indignant with Alice for sending such a man on so foolish an\nerrand, or with Clay for submitting to such a service.\n\n\"Oh, is that it?\" she said at last.  \"I will go and find you one.\"  She\ngave him a dignified little bow and moved away toward the door, with\nevery appearance of disapproval.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" she heard Clay say, doubtfully; \"I don't have to go\njust yet, do I?  May I not stay here a little while?\"\n\nHope stood and looked at him in some perplexity.\n\n\"Why, yes,\" she answered, wonderingly.  \"But don't you want to go back?\nYou came in a great hurry.  And won't Alice want her fan?\"\n\n\"Oh, she has it by this time.  I told Stuart to find it.  She left it\nin the carriage, and the carriage is waiting at the end of the plaza.\"\n\n\"Then why did you come?\" asked Hope, with rising suspicion.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Clay, helplessly.  \"I thought I'd just like a\nride in the moonlight.  I hate balls and dances anyway, don't you?  I\nthink you were very wise not to go.\"\n\nHope placed her hands on the back of the big arm-chair and looked\nsteadily at him as he stood where she could see his face in the\nmoonlight.  \"You came back,\" she said, \"because they thought I was\ncrying, and they sent you to see.  Is that it?  Did Alice send you?\"\nshe demanded.\n\nClay gave a gasp of consternation.\n\n\"You know that no one sent me,\" he said.  \"I thought they treated you\nabominably, and I wanted to come and say so.  That's all.  And I wanted\nto tell you that I missed you very much, and that your not coming had\nspoiled the evening for me, and I came also because I preferred to talk\nto you than to stay where I was. No one knows that I came to see you.\nI said I was going to get the fan, and I told Stuart to find it after\nI'd left.  I just wanted to see you, that's all.  But I will go back\nagain at once.\"\n\nWhile he had been speaking Hope had lowered her eyes from his face and\nhad turned and looked out across the harbor.  There was a strange,\nhappy tumult in her breast, and she was breathing so rapidly that she\nwas afraid he would notice it.  She also felt an absurd inclination to\ncry, and that frightened her.  So she laughed and turned and looked up\ninto his face again.  Clay saw the same look in her eyes that he had\nseen there the day when she had congratulated him on his work at the\nmines.  He had seen it before in the eyes of other women and it\ntroubled him.  Hope seated herself in the big chair, and Clay tossed\nhis cloak on the floor at her feet and sat down with his shoulders\nagainst one of the pillars.  He glanced up at her and found that the\nlook that had troubled him was gone, and that her eyes were now smiling\nwith excitement and pleasure.\n\n\"And did you bring me something from the ball in your pocket to comfort\nme,\" she asked, mockingly.\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" Clay answered, unabashed.  \"I brought you some bonbons.\"\n\n\"You didn't, really!\" Hope cried, with a shriek of delight. \"How absurd\nof you!  The sort you pull?\"\n\n\"The sort you pull,\" Clay repeated, gravely.  \"And also a dance-card,\nwhich is a relic of barbarism still existing in this Southern capital.\nIt has the arms of Olancho on it in gold, and I thought you might like\nto keep it as a souvenir.\"  He pulled the card from his coat-pocket and\nsaid, \"May I have this dance?\"\n\n\"You may,\" Hope answered.  \"But you wouldn't mind if we sat it out,\nwould you?\"\n\n\"I should prefer it,\" Clay said, as he scrawled his name across the\ncard.  \"It is so crowded inside, and the company is rather mixed.\"\nThey both laughed lightly at their own foolishness, and Hope smiled\ndown upon him affectionately and proudly.  \"You may smoke, if you\nchoose; and would you like something cool to drink?\" she asked,\nanxiously.  \"After your ride, you know,\" she suggested, with hospitable\nintent.  Clay said that he was very comfortable without a drink, but\nlighted a cigar and watched her covertly through the smoke, as she sat\nsmiling happily and quite unconsciously upon the moonlit world around\nthem.  She caught Clay's eye fixed on her, and laughed lightly.\n\n\"What is it?\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, I was just thinking,\" Hope replied, \"that it was much better to\nhave a dance come to you, than to go to the dance.\"\n\n\"Does one man and a dance-card and three bonbons constitute your idea\nof a ball?\"\n\n\"Doesn't it?  You see, I am not out yet, I don't know.\"\n\n\"I should think it might depend a good deal upon the man,\" Clay\nsuggested.\n\n\"That sounds as though you were hinting,\" said Hope, doubtfully.  \"Now\nwhat would I say to that if I were out?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but don't say it,\" Clay answered.  \"It would probably be\nsomething very unflattering or very forward, and in either case I\nshould take you back to your chaperon and leave you there.\"\n\nHope had not been listening.  Her eyes were fixed on a level with his\ntie, and Clay raised his hand to it in some trepidation. \"Mr. Clay,\"\nshe began abruptly and leaning eagerly forward, \"would you think me\nvery rude if I asked you what you did to get all those crosses?  I know\nthey mean something, and I do so want to know what.  Please tell me.\"\n\n\"Oh, those!\" said Clay.  \"The reason I put them on to-night is because\nwearing them is supposed to be a sort of compliment to your host.  I\ngot in the habit abroad--\"\n\n\"I didn't ask you that,\" said Hope, severely.  \"I asked you what you\ndid to get them.  Now begin with the Legion of Honor on the left, and\ngo right on until you come to the end, and please don't skip anything.\nLeave in all the bloodthirsty parts, and please don't be modest.\"\n\n\"Like Othello,\" suggested Clay.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Hope; \"I will be Desdemona.\"\n\n\"Well, Desdemona, it was like this,\" said Clay, laughing.  \"I got that\nmedal and that star for serving in the Nile campaign, under Wolseley.\nAfter I left Egypt, I went up the coast to Algiers, where I took\nservice under the French in a most disreputable organization known as\nthe Foreign Legion--\"\n\n\"Don't tell me,\" exclaimed Hope, in delight, \"that you have been a\nChasseur d'Afrique!  Not like the man in 'Under Two Flags'?\"\n\n\"No, not at all like that man,\" said Clay, emphatically.  \"I was just a\nplain, common, or garden, sappeur, and I showed the other\ngood-for-nothings how to dig trenches.  Well, I contaminated the\nForeign Legion for eight months, and then I went to Peru, where I--\"\n\n\"You're skipping,\" said Hope.  \"How did you get the Legion of Honor?\"\n\n\"Oh, that?\" said Clay.  \"That was a gallery play I made once when we\nwere chasing some Arabs.  They took the French flag away from our\ncolor-bearer, and I got it back again and waved it frantically around\nmy head until I was quite certain the Colonel had seen me doing it, and\nthen I stopped as soon as I knew that I was sure of promotion.\"\n\n\"Oh, how can you?\" cried Hope.  \"You didn't do anything of the sort.\nYou probably saved the entire regiment.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps I did,\" Clay returned.  \"Though I don't remember it, and\nnobody mentioned it at the time.\"\n\n\"Go on about the others,\" said Hope.  \"And do try to be truthful.\"\n\n\"Well, I got this one from Spain, because I was President of an\nInternational Congress of Engineers at Madrid.  That was the ostensible\nreason, but the real reason was because I taught the Spanish\nCommissioners to play poker instead of baccarat.  The German Emperor\ngave me this for designing a fort, and the Sultan of Zanzibar gave me\nthis, and no one but the Sultan knows why, and he won't tell.  I\nsuppose he's ashamed.  He gives them away instead of cigars.  He was\nout of cigars the day I called.\"\n\n\"What a lot of places you have seen,\" sighed Hope.  \"I have been in\nCairo and Algiers, too, but I always had to walk about with a\ngoverness, and she wouldn't go to the mosques because she said they\nwere full of fleas.  We always go to Homburg and Paris in the summer,\nand to big hotels in London.  I love to travel, but I don't love to\ntravel that way, would you?\"\n\n\"I travel because I have no home,\" said Clay.  \"I'm different from the\nchap that came home because all the other places were shut.  I go to\nother places because there is no home open.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Hope, shaking her head.  \"Why have you no\nhome?\"\n\n\"There was a ranch in Colorado that I used to call home,\" said Clay,\n\"but they've cut it up into town lots.  I own a plot in the cemetery\noutside of the town, where my mother is buried, and I visit that\nwhenever I am in the States, and that is the only piece of earth\nanywhere in the world that I have to go back to.\"\n\nHope leaned forward with her hands clasped in front of her and her eyes\nwide open.\n\n\"And your father?\" she said, softly; \"is he--is he there, too--\"\n\nClay looked at the lighted end of his cigar as he turned it between his\nfingers.\n\n\"My father, Miss Hope,\" he said, \"was a filibuster, and went out on the\n'Virginius' to help free Cuba, and was shot, against a stone wall.  We\nnever knew where he was buried.\"\n\n\"Oh, forgive me; I beg your pardon,\" said Hope.  There was such\ndistress in her voice that Clay looked at her quickly and saw the tears\nin her eyes.  She reached out her hand timidly, and touched for an\ninstant his own rough, sunburned fist, as it lay clenched on his knee.\n\"I am so sorry,\" she said, \"so sorry.\"  For the first time in many\nyears the tears came to Clay's eyes and blurred the moonlight and the\nscene before him, and he sat unmanned and silent before the simple\ntouch of a young girl's sympathy.\n\nAn hour later, when his pony struck the gravel from beneath his hoofs\non the race back to the city, and Clay turned to wave his hand to Hope\nin the doorway, she seemed, as she stood with the moonlight falling\nabout her white figure, like a spirit beckoning the way to a new\nparadise.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nClay reached the President's Palace during the supper-hour, and found\nMr. Langham and his daughter at the President's table. Madame Alvarez\npointed to a place for him beside Alice Langham, who held up her hand\nin welcome.  \"You were very foolish to rush off like that,\" she said.\n\n\"It wasn't there,\" said Clay, crowding into the place beside her.\n\n\"No, it was here in the carriage all the time.  Captain Stuart found it\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Oh, he did, did he?\" said Clay; \"that's why I couldn't find it.  I am\nhungry,\" he laughed, \"my ride gave me an appetite.\" He looked over and\ngrinned at Stuart, but that gentleman was staring fixedly at the\ncandles on the table before him, his eyes filled with concern.  Clay\nobserved that Madame Alvarez was covertly watching the young officer,\nand frowning her disapproval at his preoccupation.  So he stretched his\nleg under the table and kicked viciously at Stuart's boots.  Old\nGeneral Rojas, the Vice-President, who sat next to Stuart, moved\nsuddenly and then blinked violently at the ceiling with an expression\nof patient suffering, but the exclamation which had escaped him brought\nStuart back to the present, and he talked with the woman next him in a\nperfunctory manner.\n\nMiss Langham and her father were waiting for their carriage in the\ngreat hall of the Palace as Stuart came up to Clay, and putting his\nhand affectionately on his shoulder, began pointing to something\nfarther back in the hall.  To the night-birds of the streets and the\nnoisy fiacre drivers outside, and to the crowd of guests who stood on\nthe high marble steps waiting for their turn to depart, he might have\nbeen relating an amusing anecdote of the ball just over.\n\n\"I'm in great trouble, old man,\" was what he said.  \"I must see you\nalone to-night.  I'd ask you to my rooms, but they watch me all the\ntime, and I don't want them to suspect you are in this until they must.\nGo on in the carriage, but get out as you pass the Plaza Bolivar and\nwait for me by the statue there.\"\n\nClay smiled, apparently in great amusement.  \"That's very good,\" he\nsaid.\n\nHe crossed over to where King stood surveying the powdered beauties of\nOlancho and their gowns of a past fashion, with an intensity of\nadmiration which would have been suspicious to those who knew his\ntastes.  \"When we get into the carriage,\" said Clay, in a low voice,\n\"we will both call to Stuart that we will see him to-morrow morning at\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"All right,\" assented King.  \"What's up?\"\n\nStuart helped Miss Langham into her carriage, and as it moved away King\nshouted to him in English to remember that he was breakfasting with him\non the morrow, and Clay called out in Spanish, \"Until to-morrow at\nbreakfast, don't forget.\"  And Stuart answered, steadily, \"Good night\nuntil to-morrow at one.\"\n\nAs their carriage jolted through the dark and narrow street, empty now\nof all noise or movement, one of Stuart's troopers dashed by it at a\ngallop, with a lighted lantern swinging at his side.  He raised it as\nhe passed each street crossing, and held it high above his head so that\nits light fell upon the walls of the houses at the four corners.  The\nclatter of his horse's hoofs had not ceased before another trooper\ngalloped toward them riding more slowly, and throwing the light of his\nlantern over the trunks of the trees that lined the pavements.  As the\ncarriage passed him, he brought his horse to its side with a jerk of\nthe bridle, and swung his lantern in the faces of its occupants.\n\n\"Who lives?\" he challenged.\n\n\"Olancho,\" Clay replied.\n\n\"Who answers?\"\n\n\"Free men,\" Clay answered again, and pointed at the star on his coat.\n\nThe soldier muttered an apology, and striking his heels into his\nhorse's side, dashed noisily away, his lantern tossing from side to\nside, high in the air, as he drew rein to scan each tree and passed\nfrom one lamp-post to the next.\n\n\"What does that mean?\" said Mr. Langham; \"did he take us for\nhighwaymen?\"\n\n\"It is the custom,\" said Clay.  \"We are out rather late, you see.\"\n\n\"If I remember rightly, Clay,\" said King, \"they gave a ball at Brussels\non the eve of Waterloo.\"\n\n\"I believe they did,\" said Clay, smiling.  He spoke to the driver to\nstop the carriage, and stepped down into the street.\n\n\"I have to leave you here,\" he said; \"drive on quickly, please; I can\nexplain better in the morning.\"\n\nThe Plaza Bolivar stood in what had once been the centre of the\nfashionable life of Olancho, but the town had moved farther up the\nhill, and it was now far in the suburbs, its walks neglected and its\nturf overrun with weeds.  The houses about it had fallen into disuse,\nand the few that were still occupied at the time Clay entered it showed\nno sign of life.  Clay picked his way over the grass-grown paths to the\nstatue of Bolivar, the hero of the sister republic of Venezuela, which\nstill stood on its pedestal in a tangle of underbrush and hanging\nvines.  The iron railing that had once surrounded it was broken down,\nand the branches of the trees near were black with sleeping buzzards.\nTwo great palms reared themselves in the moonlight at either side, and\nbeat their leaves together in the night wind, whispering and murmuring\ntogether like two living conspirators.\n\n\"This ought to be safe enough,\" Clay murmured to himself. \"It's just\nthe place for plotting.  I hope there are no snakes.\"  He seated\nhimself on the steps of the pedestal, and lighting a cigar, remained\nsmoking and peering into the shadows about him, until a shadow blacker\nthan the darkness rose at his feet, and a voice said, sternly, \"Put out\nthat light.  I saw it half a mile away.\"\n\nClay rose and crushed his cigar under his foot.  \"Now then, old man,\"\nhe demanded briskly, \"what's up?  It's nearly daylight and we must\nhurry.\"\n\nStuart seated himself heavily on the stone steps, like a man tired in\nmind and body, and unfolded a printed piece of paper. Its blank side\nwas damp and sticky with paste.\n\n\"It is too dark for you to see this,\" he began, in a strained voice,\n\"so I will translate it to you.  It is an attack on Madame Alvarez and\nmyself.  They put them up during the ball, when they knew my men would\nbe at the Palace.  I have had them scouring the streets for the last\ntwo hours tearing them down, but they are all over the place, in the\ncafés and clubs.  They have done what they were meant to do.\"\n\nClay took another cigar from his pocket and rolled it between his lips.\n\"What does it say?\" he asked.\n\n\"It goes over the old ground first.  It says Alvarez has given the\nrichest birthright of his country to aliens--that means the mines and\nLangham--and has put an alien in command of the army--that is meant for\nme.  I've no more to do with the army than you have--I only wish I had!\nAnd then it says that the boundary aggressions of Ecuador and Venezuela\nhave not been resented in consequence.  It asks what can be expected of\na President who is as blind to the dishonor of his country as he is to\nthe dishonor of his own home?\"\n\nClay muttered under his breath, \"Well, go on.  Is it explicit? More\nexplicit than that?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Stuart, grimly.  \"I can't repeat it.  It is quite clear\nwhat they mean.\"\n\n\"Have you got any of them?\" Clay asked.  \"Can you fix it on some one\nthat you can fight?\"\n\n\"Mendoza did it, of course,\" Stuart answered, \"but we cannot prove it.\nAnd if we could, we are not strong enough to take him. He has the city\nfull of his men now, and the troops are pouring in every hour.\"\n\n\"Well, Alvarez can stop that, can't he?\"\n\n\"They are coming in for the annual review.  He can't show the people\nthat he is afraid of his own army.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\"\n\n\"What am I going to do?\" Stuart repeated, dully.  \"That is what I want\nyou to tell me.  There is nothing I can do now.  I've brought trouble\nand insult on people who have been kinder to me than my own blood have\nbeen.  Who took me in when I was naked and clothed me, when I hadn't a\nfriend or a sixpence to my name.  You remember--I came here from that\nrow in Colombia with my wound, and I was down with the fever when they\nfound me, and Alvarez gave me the appointment.  And this is how I\nreward them.  If I stay I do more harm.  If I go away I leave them\nsurrounded by enemies, and not enemies who fight fair, but damned\nthieves and scoundrels, who stab at women and who fight in the dark.  I\nwouldn't have had it happen, old man, for my right arm! They--they have\nbeen so kind to me, and I have been so happy here--and now!\"  The boy\nbowed his face in his hands and sat breathing brokenly while Clay\nturned his unlit cigar between his teeth and peered at him curiously\nthrough the darkness.  \"Now I have made them both unhappy, and they\nhate me, and I hate myself, and I have brought nothing but trouble to\nevery one.  First I made my own people miserable, and now I make my\nbest friends miserable, and I had better be dead.  I wish I were dead.\nI wish I had never been born.\"\n\nClay laid his hand on the other's bowed shoulder and shook him gently.\n\"Don't talk like that,\" he said; \"it does no good. Why do you hate\nyourself?\"\n\n\"What?\" asked Stuart, wearily, without looking up.  \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"You said you had made them hate you, and you added that you hated\nyourself.  Well, I can see why they naturally would be angry for the\ntime, at least.  But why do you hate yourself? Have you reason to?\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Stuart.\n\n\"Well, I can't make it any plainer,\" Clay replied.  \"It isn't a\nquestion I will ask.  But you say you want my advice.  Well, my advice\nto my friend and to a man who is not my friend, differ. And in this\ncase it depends on whether what that thing--\" Clay kicked the paper\nwhich had fallen on the ground--\"what that thing says is true.\"\n\nThe younger man looked at the paper below him and then back at Clay,\nand sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Why, damn you,\" he cried, \"what do you mean?\"\n\nHe stood above Clay with both arms rigid at his side and his head bent\nforward.  The dawn had just broken, and the two men saw each other in\nthe ghastly gray light of the morning.  \"If any man,\" cried Stuart\nthickly, \"dares to say that that blackguardly lie is true I'll kill\nhim.  You or any one else.  Is that what you mean, damn you?  If it is,\nsay so, and I'll break every bone of your body.\"\n\n\"Well, that's much better,\" growled Clay, sullenly.  \"The way you went\non wishing you were dead and hating yourself made me almost lose faith\nin mankind.  Now you go make that speech to the President, and then\nfind the man who put up those placards, and if you can't find the right\nman, take any man you meet and make him eat it, paste and all, and beat\nhim to death if he doesn't. Why, this is no time to whimper--because\nthe world is full of liars.  Go out and fight them and show them you\nare not afraid. Confound you, you had me so scared there that I almost\nthrashed you myself.  Forgive me, won't you?\" he begged earnestly. He\nrose and held out his hand and the other took it, doubtfully. \"It was\nyour own fault, you young idiot,\" protested Clay. \"You told your story\nthe wrong way.  Now go home and get some sleep and I'll be back in a\nfew hours to help you.  Look!\" he said.  He pointed through the trees\nto the sun that shot up like a red hot disk of heat above the cool\ngreen of the mountains. \"See,\" said Clay, \"God has given us another\nday.  Seven battles were fought in seven days once in my country.\nLet's be thankful, old man, that we're NOT dead, but alive to fight our\nown and other people's battles.\"\n\nThe younger man sighed and pressed Clay's hand again before he dropped\nit.\n\n\"You are very good to me,\" he said.  \"I'm not just quite myself this\nmorning.  I'm a bit nervous, I think.  You'll surely come, won't you?\"\n\n\"By noon,\" Clay promised.  \"And if it does come,\" he added, \"don't\nforget my fifteen hundred men at the mines.\"\n\n\"Good! I won't,\" Stuart replied.  \"I'll call on you if I need them.\"\nHe raised his fingers mechanically to his helmet in salute, and\ncatching up his sword turned and strode away erect and soldierly\nthrough the debris and weeds of the deserted plaza.\n\nClay remained motionless on the steps of the pedestal and followed the\nyounger man with his eyes.  He drew a long breath and began a leisurely\nsearch through his pockets for his match-box, gazing about him as he\ndid so, as though looking for some one to whom he could speak his\nfeelings.  He lifted his eyes to the stern, smooth-shaven face of the\nbronze statue above him that seemed to be watching Stuart's departing\nfigure.\n\n\"General Bolivar,\" Clay said, as he lit his cigar, \"observe that young\nman.  He is a soldier and a gallant gentleman.  You, sir, were a great\nsoldier--the greatest this God-forsaken country will ever know--and you\nwere, sir, an ardent lover.  I ask you to salute that young man as I\ndo, and to wish him well.\"  Clay lifted his high hat to the back of the\nyoung officer as it was hidden in the hanging vines, and once again,\nwith grave respect to the grim features of the great general above him,\nand then smiling at his own conceit, he ran lightly down the steps and\ndisappeared among the trees of the plaza.\n\n\n\nIX\n\nClay slept for three hours.  He had left a note on the floor\ninstructing MacWilliams and young Langham not to go to the mines, but\nto waken him at ten o'clock, and by eleven the three men were galloping\noff to the city.  As they left the Palms they met Hope returning from a\nmorning ride on the Alameda, and Clay begged her, with much concern,\nnot to ride abroad again.  There was a difference in his tone toward\nher.  There was more anxiety in it than the occasion seemed to justify,\nand he put his request in the form of a favor to himself, while the day\nprevious he would simply have told her that she must not go riding\nalone.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Hope, eagerly.  \"Is there going to be trouble?\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" Clay said, \"but the soldiers are coming in from the\nprovinces for the review, and the roads are not safe.\"\n\n\"I'd be safe with you, though,\" said Hope, smiling persuasively upon\nthe three men.  \"Won't you take me with you, please?\"\n\n\"Hope,\" said young Langham in the tone of the elder brother's brief\nauthority, \"you must go home at once.\"\n\nHope smiled wickedly.  \"I don't want to,\" she said.\n\n\"I'll bet you a box of cigars I can beat you to the veranda by fifty\nyards,\" said MacWilliams, turning his horse's head.\n\nHope clasped her sailor hat in one hand and swung her whip with the\nother.  \"I think not,\" she cried, and disappeared with a flutter of\nskirts and a scurry of flying pebbles.\n\n\"At times,\" said Clay, \"MacWilliams shows an unexpected knowledge of\nhuman nature.\"\n\n\"Yes, he did quite right,\" assented Langham, nodding his head\nmysteriously.  \"We've no time for girls at present, have we?\"\n\n\"No, indeed,\" said Clay, hiding any sign of a smile.\n\nLangham breathed deeply at the thought of the part he was to play in\nthis coming struggle, and remained respectfully silent as they trotted\ntoward the city.  He did not wish to disturb the plots and counterplots\nthat he was confident were forming in Clay's brain, and his devotion\nwould have been severely tried had he known that his hero's mind was\nfilled with a picture of a young girl in a blue shirt-waist and a\nwhipcord riding-skirt.\n\nClay sent for Stuart to join them at the restaurant, and MacWilliams\narriving at the same time, the four men seated themselves conspicuously\nin the centre of the café and sipped their chocolate as though\nunconscious of any imminent danger, and in apparent freedom from all\nresponsibilities and care.  While MacWilliams and Langham laughed and\ndisputed over a game of dominoes, the older men exchanged, under cover\nof their chatter, the few words which they had met to speak.\n\nThe manifestoes, Stuart said, had failed of their purpose.  He had\nalready called upon the President, and had offered to resign his\nposition and leave the country, or to stay and fight his maligners, and\ntake up arms at once against Mendoza's party. Alvarez had treated him\nlike a son, and bade him be patient.  He held that Caesar's wife was\nabove suspicion because she was Caesar's wife, and that no canards\nposted at midnight could affect his faith in his wife or in his friend.\nHe refused to believe that any coup d'etat was imminent, save the one\nwhich he himself meditated when he was ready to proclaim the country in\na state of revolution, and to assume a military dictatorship.\n\n\"What nonsense!\" exclaimed Clay.  \"What is a military dictatorship\nwithout soldiers?  Can't he see that the army is with Mendoza?\"\n\n\"No,\" Stuart replied.  \"Rojas and I were with him all the morning.\nRojas is an old trump, Clay.  He's not bright and he's old-fashioned;\nbut he is honest.  And the people know it.  If I had Rojas for a chief\ninstead of Alvarez, I'd arrest Mendoza with my own hand, and I wouldn't\nbe afraid to take him to the carcel through the streets.  The people\nwouldn't help him.  But the President doesn't dare.  Not that he hasn't\npluck,\" added the young lieutenant, loyally, \"for he takes his life in\nhis hands when he goes to the review tomorrow, and he knows it.  Think\nof it, will you, out there alone with a field of five thousand men\naround him!  Rojas thinks he can hold half of them, as many as Mendoza\ncan, and I have my fifty.  But you can't tell what any one of them will\ndo for a drink or a dollar.  They're no more soldiers than these\nwaiters.  They're bandits in uniform, and they'll kill for the man that\npays best.\"\n\n\"Then why doesn't Alvarez pay them?\" Clay growled.\n\nStuart looked away and lowered his eyes to the table.  \"He hasn't the\nmoney, I suppose,\" he said, evasively.  \"He--he has transferred every\ncent of it into drafts on Rothschild.  They are at the house now,\nrepresenting five millions of dollars in gold--and her jewels,\ntoo--packed ready for flight.\"\n\n\"Then he does expect trouble?\" said Clay.  \"You told me--\"\n\n\"They're all alike; you know them,\" said Stuart.  \"They won't believe\nthey're in danger until the explosion comes, but they always have a\nspecial train ready, and they keep the funds of the government under\ntheir pillows.  He engaged apartments on the Avenue Kleber six months\nago.\"\n\n\"Bah!\" said Clay.  \"It's the old story.  Why don't you quit him?\"\n\nStuart raised his eyes and dropped them again, and Clay sighed. \"I'm\nsorry,\" he said.\n\nMacWilliams interrupted them in an indignant stage-whisper. \"Say, how\nlong have we got to keep up this fake game?\" he asked.  \"I don't know\nanything about dominoes, and neither does Ted.  Tell us what you've\nbeen saying.  Is there going to be trouble?  If there is, Ted and I\nwant to be in it.  We are looking for trouble.\"\n\nClay had tipped back his chair, and was surveying the restaurant and\nthe blazing plaza beyond its open front with an expression of cheerful\nunconcern.  Two men were reading the morning papers near the door, and\ntwo others were dragging through a game of dominoes in a far corner.\nThe heat of midday had settled on the place, and the waiters dozed,\nwith their chairs tipped back against the walls.  Outside, the awning\nof the restaurant threw a broad shadow across the marble-topped tables\non the sidewalk, and half a dozen fiacre drivers slept peacefully in\ntheir carriages before the door.\n\nThe town was taking its siesta, and the brisk step of a stranger who\ncrossed the tessellated floor and rapped with his knuckles on the top\nof the cigar-case was the only sign of life.  The newcomer turned with\none hand on the glass case and swept the room carelessly with his eyes.\nThey were hard blue eyes under straight eyebrows.  Their owner was\ndressed unobtrusively in a suit of rough tweed, and this and his black\nhat, and the fact that he was smooth-shaven, distinguished him as a\nforeigner.\n\nAs he faced them the forelegs of Clay's chair descended slowly to the\nfloor, and he began to smile comprehendingly and to nod his head as\nthough the coming of the stranger had explained something of which he\nhad been in doubt.  His companions turned and followed the direction of\nhis eyes, but saw nothing of interest in the newcomer.  He looked as\nthough he might be a concession hunter from the States, or a Manchester\ndrummer, prepared to offer six months' credit on blankets and hardware.\n\nClay rose and strode across the room, circling the tables in such a way\nthat he could keep himself between the stranger and the door.  At his\napproach the new-comer turned his back and fumbled with his change on\nthe counter.\n\n\"Captain Burke, I believe?\" said Clay.  The stranger bit the cigar he\nhad just purchased, and shook his head.  \"I am very glad to see you,\"\nClay continued.  \"Sit down, won't you?  I want to talk with you.\"\n\n\"I think you've made a mistake,\" the stranger answered, quietly.  \"My\nname is--\"\n\n\"Colonel, perhaps, then,\" said Clay.  \"I might have known it. I\ncongratulate you, Colonel.\"\n\nThe man looked at Clay for an instant, with the cigar clenched between\nhis teeth and his blue eyes fixed steadily on the other's face.  Clay\nwaved his hand again invitingly toward a table, and the man shrugged\nhis shoulders and laughed, and, pulling a chair toward him, sat down.\n\n\"Come over here, boys,\" Clay called.  \"I want you to meet an old friend\nof mine, Captain Burke.\"\n\nThe man called Burke stared at the three men as they crossed the room\nand seated themselves at the table, and nodded to them in silence.\n\n\"We have here,\" said Clay, gayly, but in a low voice, \"the key to the\nsituation.  This is the gentleman who supplies Mendoza with the sinews\nof war.  Captain Burke is a brave soldier and a citizen of my own or of\nany country, indeed, which happens to have the most sympathetic\nConsul-General.\"\n\nBurke smiled grimly, with a condescending nod, and putting away the\ncigar, took out a brier pipe and began to fill it from his\ntobacco-pouch.  \"The Captain is a man of few words and extremely modest\nabout himself,\" Clay continued, lightly; \"so I must tell you who he is\nmyself.  He is a promoter of revolutions.  That is his business,--a\nprofessional promoter of revolutions, and that is what makes me so glad\nto see him again.  He knows all about the present crisis here, and he\nis going to tell us all he knows as soon as he fills his pipe.  I ought\nto warn you, Burke,\" he added, \"that this is Captain Stuart, in charge\nof the police and the President's cavalry troop.  So, you see, whatever\nyou say, you will have one man who will listen to you.\"\n\nBurke crossed one short fat leg over the other, and crowded the tobacco\nin the bowl of his pipe with his thumb.\n\n\"I thought you were in Chili, Clay,\" he said.\n\n\"No, you didn't think I was in Chili,\" Clay replied, kindly. \"I left\nChili two years ago.  The Captain and I met there,\" he explained to the\nothers, \"when Balmaceda was trying to make himself dictator.  The\nCaptain was on the side of the Congressionalists, and was furnishing\narms and dynamite. The Captain is always on the winning side, at least\nhe always has been--up to the present.  He is not a creature of\nsentiment; are you, Burke?  The Captain believes with Napoleon that God\nis on the side that has the heaviest artillery.\"\n\nBurke lighted his pipe and drummed absentmindedly on the table with his\nmatch-box.\n\n\"I can't afford to be sentimental,\" he said.  \"Not in my business.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" Clay assented, cheerfully.  He looked at Burke and\nlaughed, as though the sight of him recalled pleasant memories.  \"I\nwish I could give these boys an idea of how clever you are, Captain,\"\nhe said.  \"The Captain was the first man, for instance, to think of\npacking cartridges in tubs of lard, and of sending rifles in\npiano-cases.  He represents the Welby revolver people in England, and\nhalf a dozen firms in the States, and he has his little stores in Tampa\nand Mobile and Jamaica, ready to ship off at a moment's notice to any\nrevolution in Central America.  When I first met the Captain,\" Clay\ncontinued, gleefully, and quite unmindful of the other's continued\nsilence, \"he was starting off to rescue Arabi Pasha from the island of\nCeylon.  You may remember, boys, that when Dufferin saved Arabi from\nhanging, the British shipped him to Ceylon as a political prisoner.\nWell, the Captain was sent by Arabi's followers in Egypt to bring him\nback to lead a second rebellion. Burke had everybody bribed at Ceylon,\nand a fine schooner fitted out and a lot of ruffians to do the\nfighting, and then the good, kind British Government pardoned Arabi the\nday before Burke arrived in port.  And you never got a cent for it; did\nyou, Burke?\"\n\nBurke shook his head and frowned.\n\n\"Six thousand pounds sterling I was to have got for that,\" he said,\nwith a touch of pardonable pride in his voice, \"and they set him free\nthe day before I got there, just as Mr. Clay tells you.\"\n\n\"And then you headed Granville Prior's expedition for buried treasure\noff the island of Cocos, didn't you?\" said Clay.  \"Go on, tell them\nabout it.  Be sociable.  You ought to write a book about your different\nbusiness ventures, Burke, indeed you ought; but then,\" Clay added,\nsmiling, \"nobody would believe you.\" Burke rubbed his chin,\nthoughtfully, with his fingers, and looked modestly at the ceiling, and\nthe two younger boys gazed at him with open-mouthed interest.\n\n\"There ain't anything in buried treasure,\" he said, after a pause,\n\"except the money that's sunk in the fitting out.  It sounds good, but\nit's all foolishness.\"\n\n\"All foolishness, eh?\" said Clay, encouragingly.  \"And what did you do\nafter Balmaceda was beaten?--after I last saw you?\"\n\n\"Crespo,\" Burke replied, after a pause, during which he pulled gently\non his pipe.  \"'Caroline Brewer'--cleared from Key West for Curacao,\nwith cargo of sewing-machines and ploughs--beached below\nMaracaibo--thirty-five thousand rounds and two thousand rifles--at\ntwenty bolivars apiece.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Clay, in a tone of genuine appreciation.  \"I might\nhave known you'd be in that.  He says,\" he explained, \"that he assisted\nGeneral Crespo in Venezuela during his revolution against Guzman\nBlanco's party, and loaded a tramp steamer called the 'Caroline Brewer'\nat Key West with arms, which he landed safely at a place for which he\nhad no clearance papers, and he received forty thousand dollars in our\nmoney for the job--and very good pay, too, I should think,\" commented\nClay.\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" Burke demurred.  \"You take in the cost of leasing\nthe boat and provisioning her, and the crew's wages, and the cost of\nthe cargo; that cuts into profits.  Then I had to stand off shore\nbetween Trinidad and Curacao for over three weeks before I got the\nsignal to run in, and after that I was chased by a gun-boat for three\ndays, and the crazy fool put a shot clean through my engine-room.  Cost\nme about twelve hundred dollars in repairs.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and Clay turned his eyes to the street, and then\nasked, abruptly, \"What are you doing now?\"\n\n\"Trying to get orders for smokeless powder,\" Burke answered, promptly.\nHe met Clay's look with eyes as undisturbed as his own.  \"But they\nwon't touch it down here,\" he went on.  \"It doesn't appeal to 'em.\nIt's too expensive, and they'd rather see the smoke.  It makes them\nthink--\"\n\n\"How long did you expect to stay here?\" Clay interrupted.\n\n\"How long?\" repeated Burke, like a man in a witness-box who is trying\nto gain time.  \"Well, I was thinking of leaving by Friday, and taking a\nmule-train over to Bogota instead of waiting for the steamer to Colon.\"\nHe blew a mouthful of smoke into the air and watched it drifting toward\nthe door with apparent interest.\n\n\"The 'Santiago' leaves here Saturday for New York.  I guess you had\nbetter wait over for her,\" Clay said.  \"I'll engage your passage, and,\nin the meantime, Captain Stuart here will see that they treat you well\nin the cuartel.\"\n\nThe men around the table started, and sat motionless looking at Clay,\nbut Burke only took his pipe from his mouth and knocked the ashes out\non the heel of his boot.  \"What am I going to the cuartel for?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Well, the public good, I suppose,\" laughed Clay.  \"I'm sorry, but it's\nyour own fault.  You shouldn't have shown yourself here at all.\"\n\n\"What have you got to do with it?\" asked Burke, calmly, as he began to\nrefill his pipe.  He had the air of a man who saw nothing before him\nbut an afternoon of pleasant discourse and leisurely inactivity.\n\n\"You know what I've got to do with it,\" Clay replied.  \"I've got our\nconcession to look after.\"\n\n\"Well, you're not running the town, too, are you?\" asked Burke.\n\n\"No, but I'm going to run you out of it,\" Clay answered. \"Now, what are\nyou going to do,--make it unpleasant for us and force our hand, or\ndrive down quietly with our friend MacWilliams here?  He is the best\none to take you, because he's not so well known.\"\n\nBurke turned his head and looked over his shoulder at Stuart.\n\n\"You taking orders from Mr. Clay, to-day, Captain Stuart?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Stuart answered, smiling.  \"I agree with Mr. Clay in whatever he\nthinks right.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, in that case,\" said Burke, rising reluctantly, with a\nprotesting sigh, \"I guess I'd better call on the American minister.\"\n\n\"You can't.  He's in Ecuador on his annual visit,\" said Clay.\n\n\"Indeed!  That's bad for me,\" muttered Burke, as though in much\nconcern.  \"Well, then, I'll ask you to let me see our consul here.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Clay assented, with alacrity.  \"Mr. Langham, this young\ngentleman's father, got him his appointment, so I've no doubt he'll be\nonly too glad to do anything for a friend of ours.\"\n\nBurke raised his eyes and looked inquiringly at Clay, as though to\nassure himself that this was true, and Clay smiled back at him.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" Burke said.  \"Then, as I happen to be an Irishman by\nthe name of Burke, and a British subject, I'll try Her Majesty's\nrepresentative, and we'll see if he will allow me to be locked up\nwithout a reason or a warrant.\"\n\n\"That's no good, either,\" said Clay, shaking his head.  \"You fixed your\nnationality, as far as this continent is concerned, in Rio harbor, when\nPeixoto handed you over to the British admiral, and you claimed to be\nan American citizen, and were sent on board the 'Detroit.'  If there's\nany doubt about that we've only got to cable to Rio Janeiro--to either\nlegation.  But what's the use? They know me here, and they don't know\nyou, and I do. You'll have to go to jail and stay there.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, if you put it that way, I'll go,\" said Burke. \"But,\" he\nadded, in a lower voice, \"it's too late, Clay.\"\n\nThe expression of amusement on Clay's face, and his ease of manner,\nfell from him at the words, and he pulled Burke back into the chair\nagain.  \"What do you mean?\" he asked, anxiously.\n\n\"I mean just that, it's too late,\" Burke answered.  \"I don't mind going\nto jail.  I won't be there long.  My work's all done and paid for.  I\nwas only staying on to see the fun at the finish, to see you fellows\nmade fools of.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're sure of that, are you?\" asked Clay.\n\n\"My dear boy!\" exclaimed the American, with a suggestion in his speech\nof his Irish origin, as his interest rose.  \"Did you ever know me to go\ninto anything of this sort for the sentiment of it? Did you ever know\nme to back the losing side?  No.  Well, I tell you that you fellows\nhave no more show in this than a parcel of Sunday-school children.  Of\ncourse I can't say when they mean to strike.  I don't know, and I\nwouldn't tell you if I did.  But when they do strike there'll be no\nstriking back.  It'll be all over but the cheering.\"\n\nBurke's tone was calm and positive.  He held the centre of the stage\nnow, and he looked from one to the other of the serious faces around\nhim with an expression of pitying amusement.\n\n\"Alvarez may get off, and so may Madame Alvarez,\" he added, lowering\nhis voice and turning his face away from Stuart.  \"But not if she shows\nherself in the streets, and not if she tries to take those drafts and\njewels with her.\"\n\n\"Oh, you know that, do you?\" interrupted Clay.\n\n\"I know nothing,\" Burke replied.  \"At least, nothing to what the rest\nof them know.  That's only the gossip I pick up at headquarters.  It\ndoesn't concern me.  I've delivered my goods and given my receipt for\nthe money, and that's all I care about. But if it will make an old\nfriend feel any more comfortable to have me in jail, why, I'll go,\nthat's all.\"\n\nClay sat with pursed lips looking at Stuart.  The two boys leaned with\ntheir elbows on the tables and stared at Burke, who was searching\nleisurely through his pockets for his match-box.  From outside came the\nlazy cry of a vendor of lottery tickets, and the swift, uneven patter\nof bare feet, as company after company of dust-covered soldiers passed\non their way from the provinces, with their shoes swinging from their\nbayonets.\n\nClay slapped the table with an exclamation of impatience.\n\n\"After all, this is only a matter of business,\" he said, \"with all of\nus.  What do you say, Burke, to taking a ride with me to Stuart's\nrooms, and having a talk there with the President and Mr. Langham?\nLangham has three millions sunk in these mines, and Alvarez has even\nbetter reasons than that for wanting to hold his job.  What do you say?\nThat's better than going to jail. Tell us what they mean to do, and who\nis to do it, and I'll let you name your own figure, and I'll guarantee\nyou that they'll meet it.  As long as you've no sentiment, you might as\nwell fight on the side that will pay best.\"\n\nBurke opened his lips as though to speak, and then shut them again,\nclosely.  If the others thought that he was giving Clay's proposition a\nsecond and more serious thought, he was quick to undeceive them.\n\n\"There ARE men in the business who do that sort of thing,\" he said.\n\"They sell arms to one man, and sell the fact that he's got them to the\ndeputy-marshals, and sell the story of how smart they've been to the\nnewspapers.  And they never make any more sales after that.  I'd look\npretty, wouldn't I, bringing stuff into this country, and getting paid\nfor it, and then telling you where it was hid, and everything else I\nknew?  I've no sentiment, as you say, but I've got business instinct,\nand that's not business.  No, I've told you enough, and if you think\nI'm not safe at large, why I'm quite ready to take a ride with your\nyoung friend here.\"\n\nMacWilliams rose with alacrity, and beaming with pleasure at the\nimportance of the duty thrust upon him.\n\nBurke smiled.  \"The young 'un seems to like the job,\" he said.\n\n\"It's an honor to be associated with Captain Burke in any way,\" said\nMacWilliams, as he followed him into a cab, while Stuart galloped off\nbefore them in the direction of the cuartel.\n\n\"You wouldn't think so if you knew better,\" said Burke.  \"My friends\nhave been watching us while we have been talking in there for the last\nhour.  They're watching us now, and if I were to nod my head during\nthis ride, they'd throw you out into the street and set me free, if\nthey had to break the cab into kindling-wood while they were doing it.\"\n\nMacWilliams changed his seat to the one opposite his prisoner, and\npeered up and down the street in some anxiety.\n\n\"I suppose you know there's an answer to that, don't you?\" he asked.\n\"Well, the answer is, that if you nod your head once, you lose the top\nof it.\"\n\nBurke gave an exclamation of disgust, and gazed at his zealous guardian\nwith an expression of trepidation and unconcealed disapproval.  \"You're\nnot armed, are you?\" he asked.\n\nMacWilliams nodded.  \"Why not?\" he said; \"these are rather heavy\nweather times, just at present, thanks to you and your friends.  Why,\nyou seem rather afraid of fire-arms,\" he added, with the intolerance of\nyouth.\n\nThe Irish-American touched the young man on the knee, and lifted his\nhat.  \"My son,\" he said, \"when your hair is as gray as that, and you\nhave been through six campaigns, you'll be brave enough to own that\nyou're afraid of fire-arms, too.\"\n\n\n\nX\n\nClay and Langham left MacWilliams and Stuart to look after their\nprisoner, and returned to the Palms, where they dined in state, and\nmade no reference, while the women were present, to the events of the\nday.\n\nThe moon rose late that night, and as Hope watched it, from where she\nsat at the dinner-table facing the open windows, she saw the figure of\na man standing outlined in silhouette upon the edge of the cliff.  He\nwas dressed in the uniform of a sailor, and the moonlight played along\nthe barrel of a rifle upon which he leaned, motionless and menacing,\nlike a sentry on a rampart.\n\nHope opened her lips to speak, and then closed them again, and smiled\nwith pleasurable excitement.  A moment later King, who sat on her\nright, called one of the servants to his side and whispered some\ninstructions, pointing meanwhile at the wine upon the table.  And a\nminute after, Hope saw the white figure of the servant cross the garden\nand approach the sentinel.  She saw the sentry fling his gun sharply to\nhis hip, and then, after a moment's parley, toss it up to his shoulder\nand disappear from sight among the plants of the garden.\n\nThe men did not leave the table with the ladies, as was their custom,\nbut remained in the dining-room, and drew their chairs closer together.\n\nMr. Langham would not believe that the downfall of the Government was\nas imminent as the others believed it to be.  It was only after much\nargument, and with great reluctance, that he had even allowed King to\narm half of his crew, and to place them on guard around the Palms.\nClay warned him that in the disorder that followed every successful\nrevolution, the homes of unpopular members of the Cabinet were often\nburned, and that he feared, should Mendoza succeed, and Alvarez fall,\nthat the mob might possibly vent its victorious wrath on the Palms\nbecause it was the home of the alien, who had, as they thought, robbed\nthe country of the iron mines.  Mr. Langham said he did not think the\npeople would tramp five miles into the country seeking vengeance.\n\nThere was an American man-of-war lying in the harbor of Truxillo, a\nseaport of the republic that bounded Olancho on the south, and Clay was\nin favor of sending to her captain by Weimer, the Consul, and asking\nhim to anchor off Valencia, to protect American interests.  The run\nwould take but a few hours, and the sight of the vessel's white hull in\nthe harbor would, he thought, have a salutary effect upon the\nrevolutionists.  But Mr. Langham said, firmly, that he would not ask\nfor help until he needed it.\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry,\" said Clay.  \"I should very much like to have that\nman-of-war here.  However, if you say no, we will try to get along\nwithout her.  But, for the present, I think you had better imagine\nyourself back in New York, and let us have an entirely free hand.\nWe've gone too far to drop out,\" he went on, laughing at the sight of\nMr. Langham's gloomy countenance. \"We've got to fight them now.  It's\nagainst human nature not to do it.\"\n\nMr. Langham looked appealingly at his son and at King.\n\nThey both smiled back at him in unanimous disapproval of his policy of\nnon-interference.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" he said, at last.  \"You gentlemen can go ahead, kill,\nburn, and destroy if you wish.  But, considering the fact that it is my\nproperty you are all fighting about, I really think I might have\nsomething to say in the matter.\"  Mr. Langham gazed about him\nhelplessly, and shook his head.\n\n\"My doctor sends me down here from a quiet, happy home,\" he protested,\nwith humorous pathos, \"that I may rest and get away from excitement,\nand here I am with armed men patrolling my garden-paths, with a lot of\nfilibusters plotting at my own dinner-table, and a civil war likely to\nbreak out, entirely on my account.  And Dr. Winter told me this was the\nonly place that would cure my nervous prostration!\"\n\nHope joined Clay as soon as the men left the dining-room, and beckoned\nhim to the farther end of the veranda.  \"Well, what is it?\" she said.\n\n\"What is what?\" laughed Clay.  He seated himself on the rail of the\nveranda, with his face to the avenue and the driveway leading to the\nhouse.  They could hear the others from the back of the house, and the\nvoice of young Langham, who was giving an imitation of MacWilliams, and\nsinging with peculiar emphasis, \"There is no place like Home, Sweet\nHome.\"\n\n\"Why are the men guarding the Palms, and why did you go to the Plaza\nBolivar this morning at daybreak?  Alice says you left them there.  I\nwant to know what it means.  I am nearly as old as Ted, and he knows.\nThe men wouldn't tell me.\"\n\n\"What men?\"\n\n\"King's men from the 'Vesta'.  I saw some of them dodging around in the\nbushes, and I went to find out what they were doing, and I walked into\nfifteen of them at your office.  They have hammocks swung all over the\nveranda, and a quick-firing gun made fast to the steps, and muskets\nstacked all about, just like real soldiers, but they wouldn't tell me\nwhy.\"\n\n\"We'll put you in the carcel,\" said Clay, \"if you go spying on our\nforces.  Your father doesn't wish you to know anything about it, but,\nsince you have found it out for yourself, you might as well know what\nlittle there is to know.  It's the same story. Mendoza is getting ready\nto start his revolution, or, rather, he has started it.\"\n\n\"Why don't you stop him?\" asked Hope.\n\n\"You are very flattering,\" said Clay.  \"Even if I could stop him, it's\nnot my business to do it as yet.  I have to wait until he interferes\nwith me, or my mines, or my workmen.  Alvarez is the man who should\nstop him, but he is afraid.  We cannot do anything until he makes the\nfirst move.  If I were the President, I'd have Mendoza shot to-morrow\nmorning and declare martial law. Then I'd arrest everybody I didn't\nlike, and levy forced loans on all the merchants, and sail away to\nParis and live happy ever after.  That's what Mendoza would do if he\ncaught any one plotting against him.  And that's what Alvarez should\ndo, too, according to his lights, if he had the courage of his\nconvictions, and of his education.  I like to see a man play his part\nproperly, don't you?  If you are an emperor, you ought to conduct\nyourself like one, as our German friend does.  Or if you are a\nprize-fighter, you ought to be a human bulldog. There's no such thing\nas a gentlemanly pugilist, any more than there can be a virtuous\nburglar.  And if you're a South American Dictator, you can't afford to\nbe squeamish about throwing your enemies into jail or shooting them for\ntreason.  The way to dictate is to dictate,--not to hide indoors all\nday while your wife plots for you.\"\n\n\"Does she do that?\" asked Hope.  \"And do you think she will be in\ndanger--any personal danger, if the revolution comes?\"\n\n\"Well, she is very unpopular,\" Clay answered, \"and unjustly so, I\nthink.  But it would be better, perhaps, for her if she went as quietly\nas possible, when she does go.\"\n\n\"Is our Captain Stuart in danger, too?\" the girl continued, anxiously.\n\"Alice says they put up placards about him all over the city last\nnight.  She saw his men tearing them down as she was coming home.  What\nhas he done?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" Clay answered, shortly.  \"He happens to be in a false\nposition, that's all.  They think he is here because he is not wanted\nin his own country; that is not so.  That is not the reason he remains\nhere.  When he was even younger than he is now, he was wild and\nfoolish, and spent more money than he could afford, and lent more money\nto his brother-officers, I have no doubt, than they ever paid back.  He\nhad to leave the regiment because his father wouldn't pay his debts,\nand he has been selling his sword for the last three years to one or\nanother king or sultan or party all over the world, in China and\nMadagascar, and later in Siam.  I hope you will be very kind to Stuart\nand believe well of him, and that you will listen to no evil against\nhim.  Somewhere in England Stuart has a sister like you--about your\nage, I mean, that loves him very dearly, and a father whose heart aches\nfor him, and there is a certain royal regiment that still drinks his\nhealth with pride.  He is a lonely little chap, and he has no sense of\nhumor to help him out of his difficulties, but he is a very brave\ngentleman.  And he is here fighting for men who are not worthy to hold\nhis horse's bridle, because of a woman.  And I tell you this because\nyou will hear many lies about him--and about her.  He serves her with\nthe same sort of chivalric devotion that his ancestors felt for the\nwoman whose ribbons they tied to their lances, and for whom they fought\nin the lists.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Hope said, softly.  \"I am glad you told me.  I shall\nnot forget.\"  She sighed and shook her head.  \"I wish they'd let you\nmanage it for them,\" she said.\n\nClay laughed.  \"I fear my executive ability is not of so high an order;\nbesides, as I haven't been born to it, my conscience might trouble me\nif I had to shoot my enemies and rob the worthy merchants.  I had\nbetter stick to digging holes in the ground. That is all I seem to be\ngood for.\"\n\nHope looked up at him, quickly, in surprise.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" she demanded.  There was a tone of such\nsharp reproach in her voice that Clay felt himself put on the defensive.\n\n\"I mean nothing by it,\" he said.  \"Your sister and I had a talk the\nother day about a man's making the best of himself, and it opened my\neyes to--to many things.  It was a very healthy lesson.\"\n\n\"It could not have been a very healthy lesson,\" Hope replied, severely,\n\"if it makes you speak of your work slightingly, as you did then.  That\ndidn't sound at all natural, or like you.  It sounded like Alice.  Tell\nme, did Alice say that?\"\n\nThe pleasure of hearing Hope take his part against himself was so\ncomforting to Clay that he hesitated in answering in order to enjoy it\nthe longer.  Her enthusiasm touched him deeply, and he wondered if she\nwere enthusiastic because she was young, or because she was sure she\nwas right, and that he was in the wrong.\n\n\"It started this way,\" Clay began, carefully.  He was anxious to be\nquite fair to Miss Langham, but he found it difficult to give her point\nof view correctly, while he was hungering for a word that would\nre-establish him in his own good opinion.  \"Your sister said she did\nnot think very much of what I had done, but she explained kindly that\nshe hoped for better things from me. But what troubles me is, that I\nwill never do anything much better or very different in kind from the\nwork I have done lately, and so I am a bit discouraged about it in\nconsequence. You see,\" said Clay, \"when I come to die, and they ask me\nwhat I have done with my ten fingers, I suppose I will have to say,\n'Well, I built such and such railroads, and I dug up so many tons of\nore, and opened new countries, and helped make other men rich.'  I\ncan't urge in my behalf that I happen to have been so fortunate as to\nhave gained the good-will of yourself or your sister.  That is quite\nreason enough to me, perhaps, for having lived, but it might not appeal\nto them.  I want to feel that I have accomplished something outside of\nmyself--something that will remain after I go.  Even if it is only a\nbreakwater or a patent coupling.  When I am dead it will not matter to\nany one what I personally was, whether I was a bore or a most charming\ncompanion, or whether I had red hair or blue.  It is the work that will\ntell.  And when your sister, whose judgment is the judgment of the\noutside world, more or less, says that the work is not worth while, I\nnaturally feel a bit discouraged.  It meant so much to me, and it hurt\nme to find it meant so little to others.\"\n\nHope remained silent for some time, but the rigidity of her attitude,\nand the tightness with which she pressed her lips together, showed that\nher mind was deeply occupied.  They both sat silent for some few\nmoments, looking down toward the distant lights of the city.  At the\nfarther end of the double row of bushes that lined the avenue they\ncould see one of King's sentries passing to and fro across the roadway,\na long black shadow on the moonlit road.\n\n\"You are very unfair to yourself,\" the girl said at last, \"and Alice\ndoes not represent the opinion of the world, only of a very small part\nof it--her own little world.  She does not know how little it is.  And\nyou are wrong as to what they will ask you at the end.  What will they\ncare whether you built railroads or painted impressionist pictures?\nThey will ask you 'What have you made of yourself?  Have you been fine,\nand strong, and sincere?' That is what they will ask.  And we like you\nbecause you are all of these things, and because you look at life so\ncheerfully, and are unafraid.  We do not like men because they build\nrailroads, or because they are prime ministers.  We like them for what\nthey are themselves.  And as to your work!\" Hope added, and then paused\nin eloquent silence.  \"I think it is a grand work, and a noble work,\nfull of hardships and self-sacrifices.  I do not know of any man who\nhas done more with his life than you have done with yours.\"  She\nstopped and controlled her voice before she spoke again.  \"You should\nbe very proud,\" she said.\n\nClay lowered his eyes and sat silent, looking down the roadway. The\nthought that the girl felt what she said so deeply, and that the fact\nthat she had said it meant more to him than anything else in the world\ncould mean, left him thrilled and trembling. He wanted to reach out his\nhand and seize both of hers, and tell her how much she was to him, but\nit seemed like taking advantage of the truths of a confessional, or of\na child's innocent confidences.\n\n\"No, Miss Hope,\" he answered, with an effort to speak lightly, \"I wish\nI could believe you, but I know myself better than any one else can,\nand I know that while my bridges may stand examination--_I_ can't.\"\n\nHope turned and looked at him with eyes full of such sweet meaning that\nhe was forced to turn his own away.\n\n\"I could trust both, I think,\" the girl said.\n\nClay drew a quick, deep breath, and started to his feet, as though he\nhad thrown off the restraint under which he had held himself.\n\nIt was not a girl, but a woman who had spoken then, but, though he\nturned eagerly toward her, he stood with his head bowed, and did not\ndare to read the verdict in her eyes.\n\nThe clatter of horses' hoofs coming toward them at a gallop broke in\nrudely upon the tense stillness of the moment, but neither noticed it.\n\"How far,\" Clay began, in a strained voice, \"how far,\" he asked, more\nsteadily, \"could you trust me?\"\n\nHope's eyes had closed for an instant, and opened again, and she smiled\nupon him with a look of perfect confidence and content. The beat of the\nhorses' hoofs came now from the end of the driveway, and they could\nhear the men at the rear of the house pushing back their chairs and\nhurrying toward them.  Hope raised her head, and Clay moved toward her\neagerly.  The horses were within a hundred yards.  Before Hope could\nspeak, the sentry's voice rang out in a hoarse, sharp challenge, like\nan alarm of fire on the silent night.  \"Halt!\" they heard him cry. And\nas the horses tore past him, and their riders did not turn to look, he\nshouted again, \"Halt, damn you!\" and fired.  The flash showed a splash\nof red and yellow in the moonlight, and the report started into life\nhundreds of echoes which carried it far out over the waters of the\nharbor, and tossed it into sharp angles, and distant corners, and in an\ninstant a myriad of sounds answered it; the frightened cry of\nnight-birds, the barking of dogs in the village below, and the\nfootsteps of men running.\n\nClay glanced angrily down the avenue, and turned beseechingly to Hope.\n\n\"Go,\" she said.  \"See what is wrong,\" and moved away as though she\nalready felt that he could act more freely when she was not near him.\n\nThe two horses fell back on their haunches before the steps, and\nMacWilliams and Stuart tumbled out of their saddles, and started,\nrunning back on foot in the direction from which the shot had come,\ntugging at their revolvers.\n\n\"Come back,\" Clay shouted to them.  \"That's all right.  He was only\nobeying orders.  That's one of King's sentries.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that it?\" said Stuart, in matter-of-fact tones, as he turned\nagain to the house.  \"Good idea.  Tell him to fire lower next time.\nAnd, I say,\" he went on, as he bowed curtly to the assembled company on\nthe veranda, \"since you have got a picket out, you had better double\nit.  And, Clay, see that no one leaves here without permission--no one.\nThat's more important, even, than keeping them out.\"\n\n\"King, will you--\" Clay began.\n\n\"All right, General,\" laughed King, and walked away to meet his\nsailors, who came running up the hill in great anxiety.\n\nMacWilliams had not opened his lips, but he was bristling with\nimportance, and his effort to appear calm and soldierly, like Stuart,\ntold more plainly than speech that he was the bearer of some invaluable\nsecret.  The sight filled young Langham with a disquieting fear that he\nhad missed something.\n\nStuart looked about him, and pulled briskly at his gauntlets. King and\nhis sailors were grouped together on the grass before the house.  Mr.\nLangham and his daughters, and Clay, were standing on the steps, and\nthe servants were peering around the corners of the house.\n\nStuart saluted Mr. Langham, as though to attract his especial\nattention, and then addressed himself in a low tone to Clay.\n\n\"It's come,\" he said.  \"We've been in it since dinner-time, and we've\ngot a whole night's work cut out for you.\"  He was laughing with\nexcitement, and paused for a moment to gain breath.  \"I'll tell you the\nworst of it first.  Mendoza has sent word to Alvarez that he wants the\nmen at the mines to be present at the review to-morrow.  He says they\nmust take part.  He wrote a most insolent letter.  Alvarez got out of\nit by saying that the men were under contract to you, and that you must\ngive your permission first.  Mendoza sent me word that if you would not\nlet the men come, he would go out and fetch them in him self.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" growled Clay.  \"Kirkland needs those men to-morrow to load\nore-cars for Thursday's steamer.  He can't spare them. That is our\nanswer, and it happens to be a true one, but if it weren't true, if\nto-morrow was All Saints' Day, and the men had nothing to do but to lie\nin the sun and sleep, Mendoza couldn't get them.  And if he comes to\ntake them to-morrow, he'll have to bring his army with him to do it.\nAnd he couldn't do it then, Mr. Langham,\" Clay cried, turning to that\ngentleman, \"if I had better weapons.  The five thousand dollars I\nwanted you to spend on rifles, sir, two months ago, might have saved\nyou several millions to-morrow.\"\n\nClay's words seemed to bear some special significance to Stuart and\nMacWilliams, for they both laughed, and Stuart pushed Clay up the steps\nbefore him.\n\n\"Come inside,\" he said.  \"That is why we are here. MacWilliams has\nfound out where Burke hid his shipment of arms. We are going to try and\nget them to-night.\"  He hurried into the dining-room, and the others\ngrouped themselves about the table. \"Tell them about it, MacWilliams,\"\nStuart commanded.  \"I will see that no one overhears you.\"\n\nMacWilliams was pushed into Mr. Langham's place at the head of the long\ntable, and the others dragged their chairs up close around him.  King\nput the candles at the opposite end of the table, and set some\ndecanters and glasses in the centre.  \"To look as though we were just\nenjoying ourselves,\" he explained, pleasantly.\n\nMr. Langham, with his fine, delicate fingers beating nervously on the\ntable, observed the scene as an on-looker, rather than as the person\nchiefly interested.  He smiled as he appreciated the incongruity of the\ntableau, and the contrast which the actors presented to the situation.\nHe imagined how much it would amuse his contemporaries of the Union\nClub, at home, if they could see him then, with the still, tropical\nnight outside, the candles reflected on the polished table and on the\nangles of the decanters, and showing the intent faces of the young\ngirls and the men leaning eagerly forward around MacWilliams, who sat\nconscious and embarrassed, his hair dishevelled, and his face covered\nwith dust, while Stuart paced up and down in the shadow, his sabre\nclanking as he walked.\n\n\"Well, it happened like this,\" MacWilliams began, nervously, and\naddressing himself to Clay.  \"Stuart and I put Burke safely in a cell\nby himself.  It was one of the old ones that face the street.  There\nwas a narrow window in it, about eight feet above the floor, and no\nmeans of his reaching it, even if he stood on a chair.  We stationed\ntwo troopers before the door, and sent out to a café across the street\nfor our dinners.  I finished mine about nine o'clock, and said 'Good\nnight' to Stuart, and started to come out here. I went across the\nstreet first, however, to give the restaurant man some orders about\nBurke's breakfast.  It is a narrow street, you know, with a long\ngarden-wall and a row of little shops on one side, and with the\njail-wall taking up all of the other side.  The street was empty when I\nleft the jail, except for the sentry on guard in front of it, but just\nas I was leaving the restaurant I saw one of Stuart's police come out\nand peer up and down the street and over at the shops.  He looked\nfrightened and anxious, and as I wasn't taking chances on anything, I\nstepped back into the restaurant and watched him through the window.\nHe waited until the sentry had turned his back, and started away from\nhim on his post, and then I saw him drop his sabre so that it rang on\nthe sidewalk.  He was standing, I noticed then, directly under the\nthird window from the door of the jail.  That was the window of Burke's\ncell.  When I grasped that fact I got out my gun and walked to the door\nof the restaurant.  Just as I reached it a piece of paper shot out\nthrough the bars of Burke's cell and fell at the policeman's feet, and\nhe stamped his boot down on it and looked all around again to see if\nany one had noticed him.  I thought that was my cue, and I ran across\nthe street with my gun pointed, and shouted to him to give me the\npaper.  He jumped about a foot when he first saw me, but he was game,\nfor he grabbed up the paper and stuck it in his mouth and began to chew\non it.  I was right up on him then, and I hit him on the chin with my\nleft fist and knocked him down against the wall, and dropped on him\nwith both knees and choked him till I made him spit out the paper--and\ntwo teeth,\" MacWilliams added, with a conscientious regard for details.\n\"The sentry turned just then and came at me with his bayonet, but I put\nmy finger to my lips, and that surprised him, so that he didn't know\njust what to do, and hesitated.  You see, I didn't want Burke to hear\nthe row outside, so I grabbed my policeman by the collar and pointed to\nthe jail-door, and the sentry ran back and brought out Stuart and the\nguard.  Stuart was pretty mad when he saw his policeman all bloody.  He\nthought it would prejudice his other men against us, but I explained\nout loud that the man had been insolent, and I asked Stuart to take us\nboth to his private room for a hearing, and, of course, when I told him\nwhat had happened, he wanted to punch the chap, too.  We put him\nourselves into a cell where he could not communicate with any one, and\nthen we read the paper.  Stuart has it,\" said MacWilliams, pushing back\nhis chair, \"and he'll tell you the rest.\"  There was a pause, in which\nevery one seemed to take time to breathe, and then a chorus of\nquestions and explanations.\n\nKing lifted his glass to MacWilliams, and nodded.\n\n\"'Well done, Condor,'\" he quoted, smiling.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Clay, tapping the younger man on the shoulder as he passed\nhim.  \"That's good work.  Now show us the paper, Stuart.\"\n\nStuart pulled the candles toward him, and spread a slip of paper on the\ntable.\n\n\"Burke did this up in one of those paper boxes for wax matches,\" he\nexplained, \"and weighted it with a twenty-dollar gold piece.\nMacWilliams kept the gold piece, I believe.\"\n\n\"Going to use it for a scarf-pin,\" explained MacWilliams, in\nparenthesis.  \"Sort of war-medal, like the Chief's,\" he added, smiling.\n\n\"This is in Spanish,\" Stuart explained.  \"I will translate it. It is\nnot addressed to any one, and it is not signed, but it was evidently\nwritten to Mendoza, and we know it is in Burke's handwriting, for we\ncompared it with some notes of his that we took from him before he was\nlocked up.  He says, 'I cannot keep the appointment, as I have been\narrested.'  The line that follows here,\" Stuart explained, raising his\nhead, \"has been scratched out, but we spent some time over it, and we\nmade out that it read:  'It was Mr. Clay who recognized me, and ordered\nmy arrest. He is the best man the others have.  Watch him.'  We think\nhe rubbed that out through good feeling toward Clay.  There seems to be\nno other reason.  He's a very good sort, this old Burke, I think.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind him; it was very decent of him, anyway,\" said Clay.\n\"Go on.  Get to Hecuba.\"\n\n\"'I cannot keep the appointment, as I have been arrested,'\" repeated\nStuart.  \"'I landed the goods last night in safety.  I could not come\nin when first signalled, as the wind and tide were both off shore.  But\nwe got all the stuff stored away by morning.  Your agent paid me in\nfull and got my receipt. Please consider this as the same thing--as the\nequivalent'--it is difficult to translate it exactly,\" commented\nStuart--\"'as the equivalent of the receipt I was to have given when I\nmade my report to-night.  I sent three of your guards away on my own\nresponsibility, for I think more than that number might attract\nattention to the spot, and they might be seen from the ore-trains.'\nThat is the point of the note for us, of course,\" Stuart interrupted\nhimself to say.  \"Burke adds,\" he went on, \"'that they are to make no\neffort to rescue him, as he is quite comfortable, and is willing to\nremain in the carcel until they are established in power.'\"\n\n\"Within sight of the ore-trains!\" exclaimed Clay.  \"There are no\nore-trains but ours.  It must be along the line of the road.\"\n\n\"MacWilliams says he knows every foot of land along the railroad,\" said\nStuart, \"and he is sure the place Burke means is the old fortress on\nthe Platta inlet, because--\"\n\n\"It is the only place,\" interrupted MacWilliams, \"where there is no\nsurf.  They could run small boats up the inlet and unload in smooth\nwater within twenty feet of the ramparts; and another thing, that is\nthe only point on the line with a wagon road running direct from it to\nthe Capital.  It's an old road, and hasn't been travelled over for\nyears, but it could be used. No,\" he added, as though answering the\ndoubt in Clay's mind, \"there is no other place.  If I had a map here I\ncould show you in a minute; where the beach is level there is a jungle\nbetween it and the road, and wherever there is open country, there is a\nlimestone formation and rocks between it and the sea, where no boat\ncould touch.\"\n\n\"But the fortress is so conspicuous,\" Clay demurred; \"the nearest\nrampart is within twenty feet of the road.  Don't you remember we\nmeasured it when we thought of laying the double track?\"\n\n\"That is just what Burke says,\" urged Stuart.  \"That is the reason he\ngives for leaving only three men on guard--'I think more than that\nnumber might attract attention to the spot, as they might be seen from\nthe ore-trains.'\"\n\n\"Have you told any one of this?\" Clay asked.  \"What have you done so\nfar?\"\n\n\"We've done nothing,\" said Stuart.  \"We lost our nerve when we found\nout how much we knew, and we decided we'd better leave it to you.\"\n\n\"Whatever we do must be done at once,\" said Clay.  \"They will come for\nthe arms to-night, most likely, and we must be there first.  I agree\nwith you entirely about the place.  It is only a question now of our\nbeing on time.  There are two things to do.  The first thing is, to\nkeep them from getting the arms, and the second is, if we are lucky, to\nsecure them for ourselves. If we can pull it off properly, we ought to\nhave those rifles in the mines before midnight.  If we are hurried or\nsurprised, we must dump them off the fort into the sea.\"  Clay laughed\nand looked about him at the men.  \"We are only following out General\nBolivar's saying 'When you want arms take them from the enemy.' Now,\nthere are three places we must cover.  This house, first of all,\" he\nwent on, inclining his head quickly toward the two sisters, \"then the\ncity, and the mines.  Stuart's place, of course, is at the Palace.\nKing must take care of this house and those in it, and MacWilliams and\nLangham and I must look after the arms.  We must organize two parties,\nand they had better approach the fort from here and from the mines at\nthe same time. I will need you to do some telegraphing for me, Mac;\nand, King, I must ask you for some more men from the yacht.  How many\nhave you?\"\n\nKing answered that there were fifteen men still on board, ten of whom\nwould be of service.  He added that they were all well equipped for\nfighting.\n\n\"I believe King's a pirate in business hours,\" Clay said, smiling.\n\"All right, that's good.  Now go tell ten of them to meet me at the\nround-house in half an hour.  I will get MacWilliams to telegraph\nKirkland to run an engine and flat cars to within a half mile of the\nfort on the north, and we will come up on it with the sailors and Ted,\nhere, from the south.  You must run the engine yourself, MacWilliams,\nand perhaps it would be better, King, if your men joined us at the foot\nof the grounds here and not at the round-house.  None of the workmen\nmust see our party start.  Do you agree with me?\" he asked, turning to\nthose in the group about him.  \"Has anybody any criticism to make?\"\n\nStuart and King looked at one another ruefully and laughed.  \"I don't\nsee what good I am doing in town,\" protested Stuart. \"Yes, and I don't\nsee where I come in, either,\" growled King, in aggrieved tones.  \"These\nyoungsters can't do it all; besides I ought to have charge of my own\nmen.\"\n\n\"Mutiny,\" said Clay, in some perplexity, \"rank mutiny.  Why, it's only\na picnic.  There are but three men there.  We don't need sixteen white\nmen to frighten off three Olanchoans.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what to do,\" cried Hope, with the air of having\ndiscovered a plan which would be acceptable to every one, \"let's all\ngo.\"\n\n\"Well, I certainly mean to go,\" said Mr. Langham, decidedly.  \"So some\none else must stay here.  Ted, you will have to look after your\nsisters.\"\n\nThe son and heir smiled upon his parent with a look of affectionate\nwonder, and shook his head at him in fond and pitying disapproval.\n\n\"I'll stay,\" said King.  \"I have never seen such ungallant conduct.\nLadies,\" he said, \"I will protect your lives and property, and we'll\ninvent something exciting to do ourselves, even if we have to bombard\nthe Capital.\"\n\nThe men bade the women good-night, and left them with King and Mr.\nLangham, who had been persuaded to remain overnight, while Stuart rode\noff to acquaint Alvarez and General Rojas with what was going on.\n\n\n\nXI\n\nThere was no chance for Clay to speak to Hope again, though he felt the\ncruelty of having to leave her with everything between them in this\ninterrupted state.  But their friends stood about her, interested and\nexcited over this expedition of smuggled arms, unconscious of the great\nmiracle that had come into his life and of his need to speak to and to\ntouch the woman who had wrought it.  Clay felt how much more binding\nthan the laws of life are the little social conventions that must be\nobserved at times, even though the heart is leaping with joy or racked\nwith sorrow.  He stood within a few feet of the woman he loved, wanting\nto cry out at her and to tell her all the wonderful things which he had\nlearned were true for the first time that night, but he was forced\ninstead to keep his eyes away from her face and to laugh and answer\nquestions, and at the last to go away content with having held her hand\nfor an instant, and to have heard her say \"good-luck.\"\n\nMacWilliams called Kirkland to the office at the other end of the\nCompany's wire, and explained the situation to him.  He was instructed\nto run an engine and freight-cars to a point a quarter of a mile north\nof the fort, and to wait there until he heard a locomotive whistle or\npistol shots, when he was to run on to the fort as quickly and as\nnoiselessly as possible.  He was also directed to bring with him as\nmany of the American workmen as he could trust to keep silent\nconcerning the events of the evening.  At ten o'clock MacWilliams had\nthe steam up in a locomotive, and with his only passenger-car in the\nrear, ran it out of the yard and stopped the train at the point nearest\nthe cars where ten of the 'Vesta's' crew were waiting.  The sailors had\nno idea as to where they were going, or what they were to do, but the\nfact that they had all been given arms filled them with satisfaction,\nand they huddled together at the bottom of the car smoking and\nwhispering, and radiant with excitement and satisfaction.\n\nThe train progressed cautiously until it was within a half mile below\nthe fort, when Clay stopped it, and, leaving two men on guard, stepped\noff the remaining distance on the ties, his little band following\nnoiselessly behind him like a procession of ghosts in the moonlight.\nThey halted and listened from time to time as they drew near the ruins,\nbut there was no sound except the beating of the waves on the rocks and\nthe rustling of the sea-breeze through the vines and creepers about\nthem.\n\nClay motioned to the men to sit down, and, beckoning to MacWilliams,\ndirected him to go on ahead and reconnoitre.\n\n\"If you fire we will come up,\" he said.  \"Get back here as soon as you\ncan.\"\n\n\"Aren't you going to make sure first that Kirkland is on the other side\nof the fort?\" MacWilliams whispered.\n\nClay replied that he was certain Kirkland had already arrived. \"He had\na shorter run than ours, and he wired you he was ready to start when we\nwere, didn't he?\" MacWilliams nodded.\n\n\"Well, then, he is there.  I can count on Kirk.\"\n\nMacWilliams pulled at his heavy boots and hid them in the bushes, with\nhis helmet over them to mark the spot.  \"I feel as though I was going\nto rob a bank,\" he chuckled, as he waved his hand and crept off into\nthe underbrush.\n\nFor the first few moments the men who were left behind sat silent, but\nas the minutes wore on, and MacWilliams made no sign, they grew\nrestless, and shifted their positions, and began to whisper together,\nuntil Clay shook his head at them, and there was silence again until\none of them, in trying not to cough, almost strangled, and the others\ntittered and those nearest pummelled him on the back.\n\nClay pulled out his revolver, and after spinning the cylinder under his\nfinger-nail, put it back in its holder again, and the men, taking this\nas an encouraging promise of immediate action, began to examine their\nweapons again for the twentieth time, and there was a chorus of short,\nmuffled clicks as triggers were drawn back and cautiously lowered and\nlevers shot into place and caught again.\n\nOne of the men farthest down the track raised his arm, and all turned\nand half rose as they saw MacWilliams coming toward them on a run,\nleaping noiselessly in his stocking feet from tie to tie.  He dropped\non his knees between Clay and Langham.\n\n\"The guns are there all right,\" he whispered, panting, \"and there are\nonly three men guarding them.  They are all sitting on the beach\nsmoking.  I hustled around the fort and came across the whole outfit in\nthe second gallery.  It looks like a row of coffins, ten coffins and\nabout twenty little boxes and kegs.  I'm sure that means they are\ncoming for them to-night.  They've not tried to hide them nor to cover\nthem up.  All we've got to do is to walk down on the guards and tell\nthem to throw up their hands. It's too easy.\"\n\nClay jumped to his feet.  \"Come on,\" he said.\n\n\"Wait till I get my boots on first,\" begged MacWilliams.  \"I wouldn't\ngo over those cinders again in my bare feet for all the buried treasure\nin the Spanish Main.  You can make all the noise you want; the waves\nwill drown it.\"\n\nWith MacWilliams to show them the way, the men scrambled up the outer\nwall of the fort and crossed the moss-covered ramparts at the run.\nBelow them, on the sandy beach, were three men sitting around a\ndriftwood fire that had sunk to a few hot ashes.  Clay nodded to\nMacWilliams.  \"You and Ted can have them,\" he said. \"Go with him,\nLangham.\"\n\nThe sailors levelled their rifles at the three lonely figures on the\nbeach as the two boys slipped down the wall and fell on their hands and\nfeet in the sand below, and then crawled up to within a few feet of\nwhere the men were sitting.\n\nAs MacWilliams raised his revolver one of the three, who was cooking\nsomething over the fire, raised his head and with a yell of warning\nflung himself toward his rifle.\n\n\"Up with your hands!\" MacWilliams shouted in Spanish, and Langham,\nrunning in, seized the nearest sentry by the neck and shoved his face\ndown between his knees into the sand.\n\nThere was a great rattle of falling stones and of breaking vines as the\nsailors tumbled down the side of the fort, and in a half minute's time\nthe three sentries were looking with angry, frightened eyes at the\ncircle of armed men around them.\n\n\"Now gag them,\" said Clay.  \"Does anybody here know how to gag a man?\"\nhe asked.  \"I don't.\"\n\n\"Better make him tell what he knows first,\" suggested Langham.\n\nBut the Spaniards were too terrified at what they had done, or at what\nthey had failed to do, to further commit themselves.\n\n\"Tie us and gag us,\" one of them begged.  \"Let them find us so.  It is\nthe kindest thing you can do for us.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Clay.  \"That is what I wanted to know. They are\ncoming to-night, then.  We must hurry.\"\n\nThe three sentries were bound and hidden at the base of the wall, with\na sailor to watch them.  He was a young man with a high sense of the\nimportance of his duties, and he enlivened the prisoners by poking them\nin the ribs whenever they moved.\n\nClay deemed it impossible to signal Kirkland as they had arranged to\ndo, as they could not know now how near those who were coming for the\narms might be.  So MacWilliams was sent back for his engine, and a few\nminutes later they heard it rumble heavily past the fort on its way to\nbring up Kirkland and the flat cars.  Clay explored the lower chambers\nof the fort and found the boxes as MacWilliams had described them.  Ten\nmen, with some effort, could lift and carry the larger coffin-shaped\nboxes, and Clay guessed that, granting their contents to be rifles,\nthere must be a hundred pieces in each box, and that there were a\nthousand rifles in all.\n\nThey had moved half of the boxes to the side of the track when the\ntrain of flat cars and the two engines came crawling and twisting\ntoward them, between the walls of the jungle, like a great serpent,\nwith no light about it but the glow from the hot ashes as they fell\nbetween the rails.  Thirty men, equally divided between Irish and\nnegroes, fell off the flat cars before the wheels had ceased to\nrevolve, and, without a word of direction, began loading the heavy\nboxes on the train and passing the kegs of cartridges from hand to hand\nand shoulder to shoulder.  The sailors spread out up the road that led\nto the Capital to give warning in case the enemy approached, but they\nwere recalled before they had reason to give an alarm, and in a half\nhour Burke's entire shipment of arms was on the ore-cars, the men who\nwere to have guarded them were prisoners in the cab of the engine, and\nboth trains were rushing at full speed toward the mines.  On arriving\nthere Kirkland's train was switched to the siding that led to the\nmagazine in which was stored the rack-arock and dynamite used in the\nblasting.  By midnight all of the boxes were safely under lock in the\nzinc building, and the number of the men who always guarded the place\nfor fear of fire or accident was doubled, while a reserve, composed of\nKirkland's thirty picked men, were hidden in the surrounding houses and\nengine-sheds.\n\nBefore Clay left he had one of the boxes broken open, and found that it\nheld a hundred Mannlicher rifles.\n\n\"Good!\" he said.  \"I'd give a thousand dollars in gold if I could bring\nMendoza out here and show him his own men armed with his own\nMannlichers and dying for a shot at him.  How old Burke will enjoy this\nwhen he hears of it!\"\n\nThe party from the Palms returned to their engine after many promises\nof reward to the men for their work \"over-time,\" and were soon flying\nback with their hearts as light as the smoke above them.\n\nMacWilliams slackened speed as they neared the fort, and moved up\ncautiously on the scene of their recent victory, but a warning cry from\nClay made him bring his engine to a sharp stop. Many lights were\nflashing over the ruins and they could see in their reflection the\nfigures of men running over the same walls on which the lizards had\nbasked in undisturbed peace for years.\n\n\"They look like a swarm of hornets after some one has chucked a stone\nthrough their nest,\" laughed MacWilliams.  \"What shall we do now?  Go\nback, or wait here, or run the blockade?\"\n\n\"Oh, ride them out,\" said Langham; \"the family's anxious, and I want to\ntell them what's happened.  Go ahead.\"\n\nClay turned to the sailors in the car behind them.  \"Lie down, men,\" he\nsaid.  \"And don't any of you fire unless I tell you to.  Let them do\nall the shooting.  This isn't our fight yet, and, besides, they can't\nhit a locomotive standing still, certainly not when it's going at full\nspeed.\"\n\n\"Suppose they've torn the track up?\" said MacWilliams, grinning.  \"We'd\nlook sort of silly flying through the air.\"\n\n\"Oh, they've not sense enough to think of that,\" said Clay. \"Besides,\nthey don't know it was we who took their arms away, yet.\"\n\nMacWilliams opened the throttle gently, and the train moved slowly\nforward, gaining speed at each revolution of the wheels.\n\nAs the noise of its approach beat louder and louder on the air, a yell\nof disappointed rage and execration rose into the night from the fort,\nand a mass of soldiers swarmed upon the track, leaping up and down and\nshaking the rifles in their hands.\n\n\"That sounds a little as though they thought we had something to do\nwith it,\" said MacWilliams, grimly.  \"If they don't look out some one\nwill get hurt.\"\n\nThere was a flash of fire from where the mass of men stood, followed by\na dozen more flashes, and the bullets rattled on the smokestack and\nupon the boiler of the engine.\n\n\"Low bridge,\" cried MacWilliams, with a fierce chuckle.  \"Now, watch\nher!\"\n\nHe threw open the throttle as far as it would go, and the engine\nanswered to his touch like a race-horse to the whip.  It seemed to\nspring from the track into the air.  It quivered and shook like a live\nthing, and as it shot in between the soldiers they fell back on either\nside, and MacWilliams leaned far out of his cab-window shaking his fist\nat them.\n\n\"You got left, didn't you?\" he shouted.  \"Thank you for the\nMannlichers.\"\n\nAs the locomotive rushed out of the jungle, and passed the point on the\nroad nearest to the Palms, MacWilliams loosened three long triumphant\nshrieks from his whistle and the sailors stood up and cheered.\n\n\"Let them shout,\" cried Clay.  \"Everybody will have to know now.  It's\nbegun at last,\" he said, with a laugh of relief.\n\n\"And we took the first trick,\" said MacWilliams, as he ran his engine\nslowly into the railroad yard.\n\nThe whistles of the engine and the shouts of the sailors had carried\nfar through the silence of the night, and as the men came hurrying\nacross the lawn to the Palms, they saw all of those who had been left\nbehind grouped on the veranda awaiting them.\n\n\"Do the conquering heroes come?\" shouted King.\n\n\"They do,\" young Langham cried, joyously.  \"We've got all their arms,\nand they shot at us.  We've been under fire!\"\n\n\"Are any of you hurt?\" asked Miss Langham, anxiously, as she and the\nothers hurried down the steps to welcome them, while those of the\n'Vesta's' crew who had been left behind looked at their comrades with\nenvy.\n\n\"We have been so frightened and anxious about you,\" said Miss Langham.\n\nHope held out her hand to Clay and greeted him with a quiet, happy\nsmile, that was in contrast to the excitement and confusion that\nreigned about them.\n\n\"I knew you would come back safely,\" she said.  And the pressure of her\nhand seemed to add \"to me.\"\n\n\n\nXII\n\nThe day of the review rose clear and warm, tempered by a light breeze\nfrom the sea.  As it was a fete day, the harbor wore an air of unwonted\ninactivity; no lighters passed heavily from the levees to the\nmerchantmen at anchor, and the warehouses along the wharves were closed\nand deserted.  A thin line of smoke from the funnels of the 'Vesta'\nshowed that her fires were burning, and the fact that she rode on a\nsingle anchor chain seemed to promise that at any moment she might slip\naway to sea.\n\nAs Clay was finishing his coffee two notes were brought to him from\nmessengers who had ridden out that morning, and who sat in their\nsaddles looking at the armed force around the office with amused\nintelligence.\n\nOne note was from Mendoza, and said he had decided not to call out the\nregiment at the mines, as he feared their long absence from drill would\nmake them compare unfavorably with their comrades, and do him more harm\nthan credit.  \"He is afraid of them since last night,\" was Clay's\ncomment, as he passed the note on to MacWilliams.  \"He's quite right,\nthey might do him harm.\"\n\nThe second note was from Stuart.  He said the city was already wide\nawake and restless, but whether this was due to the fact that it was a\nfete day, or to some other cause which would disclose itself later, he\ncould not tell.  Madame Alvarez, the afternoon before, while riding in\nthe Alameda, had been insulted by a group of men around a café, who had\nrisen and shouted after her, one of them throwing a wine-glass into her\nlap as she rode past.  His troopers had charged the sidewalk and\ncarried off six of the men to the carcel.  He and Rojas had urged the\nPresident to make every preparation for immediate flight, to have the\nhorses put to his travelling carriage, and had warned him when at the\nreview to take up his position at the point nearest to his own\nbody-guard, and as far as possible from the troops led by Mendoza.\nStuart added that he had absolute confidence in the former.  The\npoliceman who had attempted to carry Burke's note to Mendoza had\nconfessed that he was the only traitor in the camp, and that he had\ntried to work on his comrades without success. Stuart begged Clay to\njoin him as quickly as possible.  Clay went up the hill to the Palms,\nand after consulting with Mr. Langham, dictated an order to Kirkland,\ninstructing him to call the men together and to point out to them how\nmuch better their condition had been since they had entered the mines,\nand to promise them an increase of wages if they remained faithful to\nMr. Langham's interests, and a small pension to any one who might be\ninjured \"from any cause whatsoever\" while serving him.\n\n\"Tell them, if they are loyal, they can live in their shacks rent free\nhereafter,\" wrote Clay.  \"They are always asking for that.  It's a\ncheap generosity,\" he added aloud to Mr. Langham, \"because we've never\nbeen able to collect rent from any of them yet.\"\n\nAt noon young Langham ordered the best three horses in the stables to\nbe brought to the door of the Palms for Clay, MacWilliams, and himself.\nClay's last words to King were to have the yacht in readiness to put to\nsea when he telephoned him to do so, and he advised the women to have\ntheir dresses and more valuable possessions packed ready to be taken on\nboard.\n\n\"Don't you think I might see the review if I went on horseback?\" Hope\nasked.  \"I could get away then, if there should be any trouble.\"\n\nClay answered with a look of such alarm and surprise that Hope laughed.\n\n\"See the review!  I should say not,\" he exclaimed.  \"I don't even want\nTed to be there.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's always the way,\" said Hope, \"I miss everything.  I think\nI'll come, however, anyhow.  The servants are all going, and I'll go\nwith them disguised in a turban.\"\n\nAs the men neared Valencia, Clay turned in his saddle, and asked\nLangham if he thought his sister would really venture into the town.\n\n\"She'd better not let me catch her, if she does,\" the fond brother\nreplied.\n\nThe reviewing party left the Government Palace for the Alameda at three\no'clock, President Alvarez riding on horseback in advance, and Madame\nAlvarez sitting in the State carriage with one of her attendants, and\nwith Stuart's troopers gathered so closely about her that the men's\nboots scraped against the wheels, and their numbers hid her almost\nentirely from sight.\n\nThe great square in which the evolutions were to take place was lined\non its four sides by the carriages of the wealthy Olanchoans, except at\nthe two gates, where there was a wide space left open to admit the\nsoldiers.  The branches of the trees on the edges of the bare parade\nground were black with men and boys, and the balconies and roofs of the\nhouses that faced it were gay with streamers and flags, and alive with\nwomen wrapped for the occasion in their colored shawls.  Seated on the\ngrass between the carriages, or surging up and down behind them, were\nthousands of people, each hurrying to gain a better place of vantage,\nor striving to hold the one he had, and forming a restless, turbulent\naudience in which all individual cries were lost in a great murmur of\nlaughter, and calls, and cheers.  The mass knit together, and pressed\nforward as the President's band swung jauntily into the square and\nhalted in one corner, and a shout of expectancy went up from the trees\nand housetops as the President's body-guard entered at the lower gate,\nand the broken place in its ranks showed that it was escorting the\nState carriage.  The troopers fell back on two sides, and the carriage,\nwith the President riding at its head, passed on, and took up a\nposition in front of the other carriages, and close to one of the sides\nof the hollow square.  At Stuart's orders Clay, MacWilliams, and\nLangham had pushed their horses into the rear rank of cavalry, and\nremained wedged between the troopers within twenty feet of where Madame\nAlvarez was sitting.  She was very white, and the powder on her face\ngave her an added and unnatural pallor.  As the people cheered her\nhusband and herself she raised her head slightly and seemed to be\ntrying to catch any sound of dissent in their greeting, or some\npossible undercurrent of disfavor, but the welcome appeared to be both\ngenuine and hearty, until a second shout smothered it completely as the\nfigure of old General Rojas, the Vice-President, and the most dearly\nloved by the common people, came through the gate at the head of his\nregiment.  There was such greeting for him that the welcome to the\nPresident seemed mean in comparison, and it was with an embarrassment\nwhich both felt that the two men drew near together, and each leaned\nfrom his saddle to grasp the other's hand.  Madame Alvarez sank back\nrigidly on her cushions, and her eyes flashed with anticipation and\nexcitement.  She drew her mantilla a little closer about her shoulders,\nwith a nervous shudder as though she were cold.  Suddenly the look of\nanxiety in her eyes changed to one of annoyance, and she beckoned Clay\nimperiously to the side of the carriage.\n\n\"Look,\" she said, pointing across the square.  \"If I am not mistaken\nthat is Miss Langham, Miss Hope.  The one on the black horse--it must\nbe she, for none of the native ladies ride.  It is not safe for her to\nbe here alone.  Go,\" she commanded, \"bring her here to me.  Put her\nnext to the carriage, or perhaps she will be safer with you among the\ntroopers.\"\n\nClay had recognized Hope before Madame Alvarez had finished speaking,\nand dashed off at a gallop, skirting the line of carriages.  Hope had\nstopped her horse beside a victoria, and was talking to the native\nwomen who occupied it, and who were scandalized at her appearance in a\npublic place with no one but a groom to attend her.\n\n\"Why, it's the same thing as a polo match,\" protested Hope, as Clay\npulled up angrily beside the victoria.  \"I always ride over to polo\nalone at Newport, at least with James,\" she added, nodding her head\ntoward the servant.\n\nThe man approached Clay and touched his hat apologetically, \"Miss Hope\nwould come, sir,\" he said, \"and I thought I'd better be with her than\nto go off and tell Mr. Langham, sir.  I knew she wouldn't wait for me.\"\n\n\"I asked you not to come,\" Clay said to Hope, in a low voice.\n\n\"I wanted to know the worst at once,\" she answered.  \"I was anxious\nabout Ted--and you.\"\n\n\"Well, it can't be helped now,\" he said.  \"Come, we must hurry, here is\nour friend, the enemy.\"  He bowed to their acquaintances in the\nvictoria and they trotted briskly off to the side of the President's\ncarriage, just as a yell arose from the crowd that made all the other\nshouts which had preceded it sound like the cheers of children at\nrecess.\n\n\"It reminds me of a football match,\" whispered young Langham,\nexcitedly, \"when the teams run on the field.  Look at Alvarez and Rojas\nwatching Mendoza.\"\n\nMendoza advanced at the front of his three troops of cavalry, looking\nneither to the left nor right, and by no sign acknowledging the fierce\nuproarious greeting of the people. Close behind him came his chosen\nband of cowboys and ruffians. They were the best equipped and least\ndisciplined soldiers in the army, and were, to the great relief of the\npeople, seldom seen in the city, but were kept moving in the mountain\npasses and along the coast line, on the lookout for smugglers with whom\nthey were on the most friendly terms.  They were a picturesque body of\nblackguards, in their hightopped boots and silver-tipped sombreros and\nheavy, gaudy saddles, but the shout that had gone up at their advance\nwas due as much to the fear they inspired as to any great love for them\nor their chief.\n\n\"Now all the chessmen are on the board, and the game can begin,\" said\nClay.  \"It's like the scene in the play, where each man has his sword\nat another man's throat and no one dares make the first move.\"  He\nsmiled as he noted, with the eye of one who had seen Continental troops\nin action, the shuffling steps and slovenly carriage of the half-grown\nsoldiers that followed Mendoza's cavalry at a quick step.  Stuart's\npicked men, over whom he had spent many hot and weary hours, looked\nlike a troop of Life Guardsmen in comparison.  Clay noted their\nsuperiority, but he also saw that in numbers they were most woefully at\na disadvantage.\n\nIt was a brilliant scene for so modest a capital.  The sun flashed on\nthe trappings of the soldiers, on the lacquer and polished metal work\nof the carriages; and the Parisian gowns of their occupants and the\nfluttering flags and banners filled the air with color and movement,\nwhile back of all, framing the parade ground with a band of black, was\nthe restless mob of people applauding the evolutions, and cheering for\ntheir favorites, Alvarez, Mendoza, and Rojas, moved by an excitement\nthat was in disturbing contrast to the easy good-nature of their usual\nmanner.\n\nThe marching and countermarching of the troops had continued with\nspirit for some time, and there was a halt in the evolutions which left\nthe field vacant, except for the presence of Mendoza's cavalrymen, who\nwere moving at a walk along one side of the quadrangle.  Alvarez and\nVice-President Rojas, with Stuart, as an adjutant at their side, were\nsitting their horses within some fifty yards of the State carriage and\nthe body-guard.  Alvarez made a conspicuous contrast in his black coat\nand high hat to the brilliant greens and reds of his generals'\nuniforms, but he sat his saddle as well as either of the others, and\nhis white hair, white imperial and mustache, and the dignity of his\nbearing distinguished him above them both.  Little Stuart, sitting at\nhis side, with his blue eyes glaring from under his white helmet and\nhis face burned to almost as red a tint as his curly hair, looked like\na fierce little bull-dog in comparison.  None of the three men spoke as\nthey sat motionless and quite alone waiting for the next movement of\nthe troops.\n\nIt proved to be one of moment.  Even before Mendoza had ridden toward\nthem with his sword at salute, Clay gave an exclamation of\nenlightenment and concern.  He saw that the men who were believed to be\ndevoted to Rojas, had been halted and left standing at the farthest\ncorner of the plaza, nearly two hundred yards from where the President\nhad taken his place, that Mendoza's infantry surrounded them on every\nside, and that Mendoza's cowboys, who had been walking their horses,\nhad wheeled and were coming up with an increasing momentum, a flying\nmass of horses and men directed straight at the President himself.\n\nMendoza galloped up to Alvarez with his sword still in salute. His eyes\nwere burning with excitement and with the light of success.  No one but\nStuart and Rojas heard his words; to the spectators and to the army he\nappeared as though he was, in his capacity of Commander-in-Chief,\ndelivering some brief report, or asking for instructions.\n\n\"Dr. Alvarez,\" he said, \"as the head of the army I arrest you for high\ntreason; you have plotted to place yourself in office without popular\nelection.  You are also accused of large thefts of public funds.  I\nmust ask you to ride with me to the military prison.  General Rojas, I\nregret that as an accomplice of the President's, you must come with us\nalso.  I will explain my action to the people when you are safe in\nprison, and I will proclaim martial law.  If your troops attempt to\ninterfere, my men have orders to fire on them and you.\"\n\nStuart did not wait for his sentence.  He had heard the heavy beat of\nthe cavalry coming up on them at a trot.  He saw the ranks open and two\nmen catch at each bridle rein of both Alvarez and Rojas and drag them\non with them, buried in the crush of horses about them, and swept\nforward by the weight and impetus of the moving mass behind.  Stuart\ndashed off to the State carriage and seized the nearest of the horses\nby the bridle.  \"To the Palace!\" he shouted to his men.  \"Shoot any one\nwho tries to stop you.  Forward, at a gallop,\" he commanded.\n\nThe populace had not discovered what had occurred until it was\nfinished.  The coup d'etat had been long considered and the manner in\nwhich it was to be carried out carefully planned.  The cavalry had\nswept across the parade ground and up the street before the people saw\nthat they carried Rojas and Alvarez with them.  The regiment commanded\nby Rojas found itself hemmed in before and behind by Mendoza's two\nregiments.  They were greatly outnumbered, but they fired a scattering\nshot, and following their captured leader, broke through the line\naround them and pursued the cavalry toward the military prison.\n\nIt was impossible to tell in the uproar which followed how many or how\nfew had been parties to the plot.  The mob, shrieking and shouting and\nleaping in the air, swarmed across the parade ground, and from a dozen\ndifferent points men rose above the heads of the people and harangued\nthem in violent speeches.  And while some of the soldiers and the\ncitizens gathered anxiously about these orators, others ran through the\ncity calling for the rescue of the President, for an attack on the\npalace, and shrieking \"Long live the Government!\" and \"Long live the\nRevolution!\"  The State carriage raced through the narrow streets with\nits body-guard galloping around it, sweeping down in its rush stray\npedestrians, and scattering the chairs and tables in front of the\ncafés.  As it dashed up the long avenue of the palace, Stuart called\nhis men back and ordered them to shut and barricade the great iron\ngates and to guard them against the coming of the mob, while\nMacWilliams and young Langham pulled open the carriage door and\nassisted the President's wife and her terrified companion to alight.\nMadame Alvarez was trembling with excitement as she leaned on Langham's\narm, but she showed no signs of fear in her face or in her manner.\n\n\"Mr. Clay has gone to bring your travelling carriage to the rear door,\"\nLangham said.  \"Stuart tells us it is harnessed and ready.  You will\nhurry, please, and get whatever you need to carry with you.  We will\nsee you safely to the coast.\"\n\nAs they entered the hall, and were ascending the great marble stairway,\nHope and her groom, who had followed in the rear of the cavalry, came\nrunning to meet them.  \"I got in by the back way,\" Hope explained.\n\"The streets there are all deserted. How can I help you?\" she asked,\neagerly.\n\n\"By leaving me,\" cried the older woman.  \"Good God, child, have I not\nenough to answer for without dragging you into this? Go home at once\nthrough the botanical garden, and then by way of the wharves.  That\npart of the city is still empty.\"\n\n\"Where are your servants; why are they not here?\" Hope demanded without\nheeding her.  The palace was strangely empty; no footsteps came running\nto greet them, no doors opened or shut as they hurried to Madame\nAlvarez's apartments.  The servants of the household had fled at the\nfirst sound of the uproar in the city, and the dresses and ornaments\nscattered on the floor told that they had not gone empty-handed.  The\nwoman who had accompanied Madame Alvarez to the review sank weeping on\nthe bed, and then, as the shouts grew suddenly louder and more near,\nran to hide herself in the upper stories of the house.  Hope crossed to\nthe window and saw a great mob of soldiers and citizens sweep around\nthe corner and throw themselves against the iron fence of the palace.\n\"You will have to hurry,\" she said.  \"Remember, you are risking the\nlives of those boys by your delay.\"\n\nThere was a large bed in the room, and Madame Alvarez had pulled it\nforward and was bending over a safe that had opened in the wall, and\nwhich had been hidden by the head board of the bed. She held up a\nbundle of papers in her hand, wrapped in a leather portfolio.  \"Do you\nsee these?\" she cried, \"they are drafts for five millions of dollars.\"\nShe tossed them back into the safe and swung the door shut.\n\n\"You are a witness.  I do not take them,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" Hope answered, \"but hurry.  Have you everything\nyou want--have you your jewels?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the woman answered, as she rose to her feet, \"they are mine.\"\n\nA yell more loud and terrible than any that had gone before rose from\nthe garden below, and there was the sound of iron beating against iron,\nand cries of rage and execration from a great multitude.\n\n\"I will not go!\" the Spanish woman cried, suddenly.  \"I will not leave\nAlvarez to that mob.  If they want to kill me, let them kill me.\"  She\nthrew the bag that held her jewels on the bed, and pushing open the\nwindow stepped out upon the balcony.  She was conspicuous in her black\ndress against the yellow stucco of the wall, and in an instant the mob\nsaw her and a mad shout of exultation and anger rose from the mass that\nbeat and crushed itself against the high iron railings of the garden.\nHope caught the woman by the skirt and dragged her back.  \"You are\nmad,\" she said.  \"What good can you do your husband here?  Save\nyourself and he will come to you when he can.  There is nothing you can\ndo for him now; you cannot give your life for him.  You are wasting it,\nand you are risking the lives of the men who are waiting for us below.\nCome, I tell you.\"\n\nMacWilliams left Clay waiting beside the diligence and ran from the\nstable through the empty house and down the marble stairs to the garden\nwithout meeting any one on his way.  He saw Stuart helping and\ndirecting his men to barricade the gates with iron urns and garden\nbenches and sentry-boxes.  Outside the mob were firing at him with\ntheir revolvers, and calling him foul names, but Stuart did not seem to\nhear them.  He greeted MacWilliams with a cheerful little laugh.\n\"Well,\" he asked, \"is she ready?\"\n\n\"No, but we are.  Clay and I've been waiting there for five minutes.\nWe found Miss Hope's groom and sent him back to the Palms with a\nmessage to King.  We told him to run the yacht to Los Bocos and lie off\nshore until we came.  He is to take her on down the coast to Truxillo,\nwhere our man-of-war is lying, and they will give her shelter as a\npolitical refugee.\"\n\n\"Why don't you drive her to the Palms at once?\" demanded Stuart,\nanxiously, \"and take her on board the yacht there?  It is ten miles to\nBocos and the roads are very bad.\"\n\n\"Clay says we could never get her through the city,\" MacWilliams\nanswered.  \"We should have to fight all the way. But the city to the\nsouth is deserted, and by going out by the back roads, we can make\nBocos by ten o'clock to-night.  The yacht should reach there by seven.\"\n\n\"You are right; go back.  I will call off some of my men.  The rest\nmust hold this mob back until you start; then I will follow with the\nothers.  Where is Miss Hope?\"\n\n\"We don't know.  Clay is frantic.  Her groom says she is somewhere in\nthe palace.\"\n\n\"Hurry,\" Stuart commanded.  \"If Mendoza gets here before Madame Alvarez\nleaves, it will be too late.\"\n\nMacWilliams sprang up the steps of the palace, and Stuart, calling to\nthe men nearest him to follow, started after him on a run.\n\nAs Stuart entered the palace with his men at his heels, Clay was\nhurrying from its rear entrance along the upper hall, and Hope and\nMadame Alvarez were leaving the apartments of the latter at its front.\nThey met at the top of the main stairway just as Stuart put his foot on\nits lower step.  The young Englishman heard the clatter of his men\nfollowing close behind him and leaped eagerly forward.  Half way to the\ntop the noise behind him ceased, and turning his head quickly he looked\nback over his shoulder and saw that the men had halted at the foot of\nthe stairs and stood huddled together in disorder looking up at him.\nStuart glanced over their heads and down the hallway to the garden\nbeyond to see if they were followed, but the mob still fought from the\nouter side of the barricade.  He waved his sword impatiently and\nstarted forward again.  \"Come on!\" he shouted. But the men below him\ndid not move.  Stuart halted once more and this time turned about and\nlooked down upon them with surprise and anger.  There was not one of\nthem he could not have called by name.  He knew all their little\ntroubles, their love-affairs, even.  They came to him for comfort and\nadvice, and to beg for money.  He had regarded them as his children,\nand he was proud of them as soldiers because they were the work of his\nhands.\n\nSo, instead of a sharp command, he asked, \"What is it?\" in surprise,\nand stared at them wondering.  He could not or would not comprehend,\neven though he saw that those in the front rank were pushing back and\nthose behind were urging them forward.  The muzzles of their carbines\nwere directed at every point, and on their faces fear and hate and\ncowardice were written in varying likenesses.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Stuart demanded, sharply.  \"What are you waiting\nfor?\"\n\nClay had just reached the top of the stairs.  He saw Madame Alvarez and\nHope coming toward him, and at the sight of Hope he gave an exclamation\nof relief.\n\nThen his eyes turned and fell on the tableau below, on Stuart's back,\nas he stood confronting the men, and on their scowling upturned faces\nand half-lifted carbines.  Clay had lived for a longer time among\nSpanish-Americans than had the English subaltern, or else he was the\nquicker of the two to believe in evil and ingratitude, for he gave a\ncry of warning, and motioned the women away.\n\n\"Stuart!\" he cried.  \"Come away; for God's sake, what are you doing?\nCome back!\"\n\nThe Englishman started at the sound of his friend's voice, but he did\nnot turn his head.  He began to descend the stairs slowly, a step at a\ntime, staring at the mob so fiercely that they shrank back before the\nlook of wounded pride and anger in his eyes. Those in the rear raised\nand levelled their rifles.  Without taking his eyes from theirs, Stuart\ndrew his revolver, and with his sword swinging from its wrist-strap,\npointed his weapon at the mass below him.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" he demanded.  \"Is this mutiny?\"\n\nA voice from the rear of the crowd of men shrieked:  \"Death to the\nSpanish woman.  Death to all traitors.  Long live Mendoza,\" and the\nothers echoed the cry in chorus.\n\nClay sprang down the broad stairs calling, \"Come to me;\" but before he\ncould reach Stuart, a woman's voice rang out, in a long terrible cry of\nterror, a cry that was neither a prayer nor an imprecation, but which\nheld the agony of both.  Stuart started, and looked up to where Madame\nAlvarez had thrown herself toward him across the broad balustrade of\nthe stairway.  She was silent with fear, and her hand clutched at the\nair, as she beckoned wildly to him.  Stuart stared at her with a\ntroubled smile and waved his empty hand to reassure her.  The movement\nwas final, for the men below, freed from the reproach of his eyes,\nflung up their carbines and fired, some wildly, without placing their\nguns at rest, and others steadily and aiming straight at his heart.\n\nAs the volley rang out and the smoke drifted up the great staircase,\nthe subaltern's hands tossed high above his head, his body sank into\nitself and toppled backward, and, like a tired child falling to sleep,\nthe defeated soldier of fortune dropped back into the outstretched arms\nof his friend.\n\nClay lifted him upon his knee, and crushed him closer against his\nbreast with one arm, while he tore with his free hand at the stock\nabout the throat and pushed his fingers in between the buttons of the\ntunic.  They came forth again wet and colored crimson.\n\n\"Stuart!\" Clay gasped.  \"Stuart, speak to me, look at me!\" He shook the\nbody in his arms with fierce roughness, peering into the face that\nrested on his shoulder, as though he could command the eyes back again\nto light and life.  \"Don't leave me!\" he said.  \"For God's sake, old\nman, don't leave me!\"\n\nBut the head on his shoulder only sank the closer and the body\nstiffened in his arms.  Clay raised his eyes and saw the soldiers still\nstanding, irresolute and appalled at what they had done, and awe-struck\nat the sight of the grief before them.\n\nClay gave a cry as terrible as the cry of a woman who has seen her\nchild mangled before her eyes, and lowering the body quickly to the\nsteps, he ran at the scattering mass below him.  As he came they fled\ndown the corridor, shrieking and calling to their friends to throw open\nthe gates and begging them to admit the mob.  When they reached the\nouter porch they turned, encouraged by the touch of numbers, and halted\nto fire at the man who still followed them.\n\nClay stopped, with a look in his eyes which no one who knew them had\never seen there, and smiled with pleasure in knowing himself a master\nin what he had to do.  And at each report of his revolver one of\nStuart's assassins stumbled and pitched heavily forward on his face.\nThen he turned and walked slowly back up the hall to the stairway like\na man moving in his sleep.  He neither saw nor heard the bullets that\nbit spitefully at the walls about him and rattled among the glass\npendants of the great chandeliers above his head.  When he came to the\nstep on which the body lay he stooped and picked it up gently, and\nholding it across his breast, strode on up the stairs.  MacWilliams and\nLangham were coming toward him, and saw the helpless figure in his arms.\n\n\"What is it?\" they cried; \"is he wounded, is he hurt?\"\n\n\"He is dead,\" Clay answered, passing on with his burden.  \"Get Hope\naway.\"\n\nMadame Alvarez stood with the girl's arms about her, her eyes closed\nand her figure trembling.\n\n\"Let me be!\" she moaned.  \"Don't touch me; let me die.  My God, what\nhave I to live for now?\"  She shook off Hope's supporting arm, and\nstood before them, all her former courage gone, trembling and shivering\nin agony.  \"I do not care what they do to me!\" she cried.  She tore her\nlace mantilla from her shoulders and threw it on the floor.  \"I shall\nnot leave this place.  He is dead.  Why should I go?  He is dead.  They\nhave murdered him; he is dead.\"\n\n\"She is fainting,\" said Hope.  Her voice was strained and hard.\n\nTo her brother she seemed to have grown suddenly much older, and he\nlooked to her to tell him what to do.\n\n\"Take hold of her,\" she said.  \"She will fall.\"  The woman sank back\ninto the arms of the men, trembling and moaning feebly.\n\n\"Now carry her to the carriage,\" said Hope.  \"She has fainted; it is\nbetter; she does not know what has happened.\"\n\nClay, still bearing the body in his arms, pushed open the first door\nthat stood ajar before him with his foot.  It opened into the great\nbanqueting hall of the palace, but he could not choose.\n\nHe had to consider now the safety of the living, whose lives were still\nin jeopardy.\n\nThe long table in the centre of the hall was laid with places for many\npeople, for it had been prepared for the President and the President's\nguests, who were to have joined with him in celebrating the successful\nconclusion of the review.  From outside the light of the sun, which was\njust sinking behind the mountains, shone dimly upon the silver on the\nboard, on the glass and napery, and the massive gilt centre-pieces\nfilled with great clusters of fresh flowers.  It looked as though the\nservants had but just left the room.  Even the candles had been lit in\nreadiness, and as their flames wavered and smoked in the evening breeze\nthey cast uncertain shadows on the walls and showed the stern faces of\nthe soldier presidents frowning down on the crowded table from their\ngilded frames.\n\nThere was a great leather lounge stretching along one side of the hall,\nand Clay moved toward this quickly and laid his burden down.  He was\nconscious that Hope was still following him.  He straightened the limbs\nof the body and folded the arms across the breast and pressed his hand\nfor an instant on the cold hands of his friend, and then whispering\nsomething between his lips, turned and walked hurriedly away.\n\nHope confronted him in the doorway.  She was sobbing silently. \"Must we\nleave him,\" she pleaded, \"must we leave him--like this?\"\n\nFrom the garden there came the sound of hammers ringing on the iron\nhinges, and a great crash of noises as the gate fell back from its\nfastenings, and the mob rushed over the obstacles upon which it had\nfallen.  It seemed as if their yells of exultation and anger must reach\neven the ears of the dead man.\n\n\"They are calling Mendoza,\" Clay whispered, \"he must be with them.\nCome, we will have to run for our lives now.\"\n\nBut before he could guess what Hope was about to do, or could prevent\nher, she had slipped past him and picked up Stuart's sword that had\nfallen from his wrist to the floor, and laid it on the soldier's body,\nand closed his hands upon its hilt.  She glanced quickly about her as\nthough looking for something, and then with a sob of relief ran to the\ntable, and sweeping it of an armful of its flowers, stepped swiftly\nback again to the lounge and heaped them upon it.\n\n\"Come, for God's sake, come!\" Clay called to her in a whisper from the\ndoor.\n\nHope stood for an instant staring at the young Englishman as the\ncandle-light flickered over his white face, and then, dropping on her\nknees, she pushed back the curly hair from about the boy's forehead and\nkissed him.  Then, without turning to look again, she placed her hand\nin Clay's and he ran with her, dragging her behind him down the length\nof the hall, just as the mob entered it on the floor below them and\nfilled the palace with their shouts of triumph.\n\nAs the sun sank lower its light fell more dimly on the lonely figure in\nthe vast dining-hall, and as the gloom deepened there, the candles\nburned with greater brilliancy, and the faces of the portraits shone\nmore clearly.\n\nThey seemed to be staring down less sternly now upon the white mortal\nface of the brother-in-arms who had just joined them.\n\nOne who had known him among his own people would have seen in the\nattitude and in the profile of the English soldier a likeness to his\nancestors of the Crusades who lay carved in stone in the village\nchurch, with their faces turned to the sky, their faithful hounds\nwaiting at their feet, and their hands pressed upward in prayer.\n\nAnd when, a moment later, the half-crazed mob of men and boys swept\ninto the great room, with Mendoza at their head, something of the\npathos of the young Englishman's death in his foreign place of exile\nmust have touched them, for they stopped appalled and startled, and\npressed back upon their fellows, with eager whispers.  The\nSpanish-American General strode boldly forward, but his eyes lowered\nbefore the calm, white face, and either because the lighted candles and\nthe flowers awoke in him some memory of the great Church that had\nnursed him, or because the jagged holes in the soldier's tunic appealed\nto what was bravest in him, he crossed himself quickly, and then\nraising his hands slowly to his visor, lifted his hat and pointed with\nit to the door.  And the mob, without once looking back at the rich\ntreasure of silver on the table, pushed out before him, stepping\nsoftly, as though they had intruded on a shrine.\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nThe President's travelling carriage was a double-seated diligence\ncovered with heavy hoods and with places on the box for two men. Only\none of the coachmen, the same man who had driven the State carriage\nfrom the review, had remained at the stables.  As he knew the roads to\nLos Bocos, Clay ordered him up to the driver's seat, and MacWilliams\nclimbed into the place beside him after first storing three rifles\nunder the lap-robe.\n\nHope pulled open the leather curtains of the carriage and found Madame\nAlvarez where the men had laid her upon the cushions, weak and\nhysterical.  The girl crept in beside her, and lifting her in her arms,\nrested the older woman's head against her shoulder, and soothed and\ncomforted her with tenderness and sympathy.\n\nClay stopped with his foot in the stirrup and looked up anxiously at\nLangham who was already in the saddle.\n\n\"Is there no possible way of getting Hope out of this and back to the\nPalms?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, it's too late.  This is the only way now.\"  Hope opened the\nleather curtains and looking out shook her head impatiently at Clay.\n\"I wouldn't go now if there were another way,\" she said.  \"I couldn't\nleave her like this.\"\n\n\"You're delaying the game, Clay,\" cried Langham, warningly, as he stuck\nhis spurs into his pony's side.\n\nThe people in the diligence lurched forward as the horses felt the lash\nof the whip and strained against the harness, and then plunged ahead at\na gallop on their long race to the sea.  As they sped through the\ngardens, the stables and the trees hid them from the sight of those in\nthe palace, and the turf, upon which the driver had turned the horses\nfor greater safety, deadened the sound of their flight.\n\nThey found the gates of the botanical gardens already opened, and Clay,\nin the street outside, beckoning them on.  Without waiting for the\nothers the two outriders galloped ahead to the first cross street,\nlooked up and down its length, and then, in evident concern at what\nthey saw in the distance, motioned the driver to greater speed, and\ncrossing the street signalled him to follow them.  At the next corner\nClay flung himself off his pony, and throwing the bridle to Langham,\nran ahead into the cross street on foot, and after a quick glance\npointed down its length away from the heart of the city to the\nmountains.\n\nThe driver turned as Clay directed him, and when the man found that his\nface was fairly set toward the goal he lashed his horses recklessly\nthrough the narrow street, so that the murmur of the mob behind them\ngrew perceptibly fainter at each leap forward.\n\nThe noise of the galloping hoofs brought women and children to the\nbarred windows of the houses, but no men stepped into the road to stop\ntheir progress, and those few they met running in the direction of the\npalace hastened to get out of their way, and stood with their backs\npressed against the walls of the narrow thoroughfare looking after them\nwith wonder.\n\nEven those who suspected their errand were helpless to detain them, for\nsooner than they could raise the hue and cry or formulate a plan of\naction, the carriage had passed and was disappearing in the distance,\nrocking from wheel to wheel like a ship in a gale.  Two men who were so\nbold as to start to follow, stopped abruptly when they saw the\noutriders draw rein and turn in their saddles as though to await their\ncoming.\n\nClay's mind was torn with doubts, and his nerves were drawn taut like\nthe strings of a violin.  Personal danger exhilarated him, but this\nchance of harm to others who were helpless, except for him, depressed\nhis spirit with anxiety.  He experienced in his own mind all the\nnervous fears of a thief who sees an officer in every passing citizen,\nand at one moment he warned the driver to move more circumspectly, and\nso avert suspicion, and the next urged him into more desperate bursts\nof speed.  In his fancy every cross street threatened an ambush, and as\nhe cantered now before and now behind the carriage, he wished that he\nwas a multitude of men who could encompass it entirely and hide it.\n\nBut the solid streets soon gave way to open places, and low mud cabins,\nwhere the horses' hoofs beat on a sun-baked road, and where the\ninhabitants sat lazily before the door in the fading light, with no\nknowledge of the changes that the day had wrought in the city, and with\nonly a moment's curious interest in the hooded carriage, and the grim,\nwhite-faced foreigners who guarded it.\n\nClay turned his pony into a trot at Langham's side.  His face was pale\nand drawn.\n\nAs the danger of immediate pursuit and capture grew less, the carriage\nhad slackened its pace, and for some minutes the outriders galloped on\ntogether side by side in silence.  But the same thought was in the mind\nof each, and when Langham spoke it was as though he were continuing\nwhere he had but just been interrupted.\n\nHe laid his hand gently on Clay's arm.  He did not turn his face toward\nhim, and his eyes were still peering into the shadows before them.\n\"Tell me?\" he asked.\n\n\"He was coming up the stairs,\" Clay answered.  He spoke in so low a\nvoice that Langham had to lean from his saddle to hear him. \"They were\nclose behind; but when they saw her they stopped and refused to go\nfarther.  I called to him to come away, but he would not understand.\nThey killed him before he really understood what they meant to do.  He\nwas dead almost before I reached him.  He died in my arms.\"  There was\na long pause.  \"I wonder if he knows that?\" Clay said.\n\nLangham sat erect in the saddle again and drew a short breath. \"I wish\nhe could have known how he helped me,\" he whispered, \"how much just\nknowing him helped me.\"\n\nClay bowed his head to the boy as though he were thanking him. \"His was\nthe gentlest soul I ever knew,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what I wanted to say,\" Langham answered.  \"We will let that be\nhis epitaph,\" and touching his spur to his horse he galloped on ahead\nand left Clay riding alone.\n\nLangham had proceeded for nearly a mile when he saw the forest opening\nbefore them, and at the sight he gave a shout of relief, but almost at\nthe same instant he pulled his pony back on his haunches and whirling\nhim about, sprang back to the carriage with a cry of warning.\n\n\"There are soldiers ahead of us,\" he cried.  \"Did you know it?\" he\ndemanded of the driver.  \"Did you lie to me?  Turn back.\"\n\n\"He can't turn back,\" MacWilliams answered.  \"They have seen us.  They\nare only the custom officers at the city limits.  They know nothing.\nGo on.\"  He reached forward and catching the reins dragged the horses\ndown into a walk.  Then he handed the reins back to the driver with a\nshake of the head.\n\n\"If you know these roads as well as you say you do, you want to keep us\nout of the way of soldiers,\" he said.  \"If we fall into a trap you'll\nbe the first man shot on either side.\"\n\nA sentry strolled lazily out into the road dragging his gun after him\nby the bayonet, and raised his hand for them to halt.  His captain\nfollowed him from the post-house throwing away a cigarette as he came,\nand saluted MacWilliams on the box and bowed to the two riders in the\nbackground.  In his right hand he held one of the long iron rods with\nwhich the collectors of the city's taxes were wont to pierce the\nbundles and packs, and even the carriage cushions of those who entered\nthe city limits from the coast, and who might be suspected of smuggling.\n\n\"Whose carriage is this, and where is it going?\" he asked.\n\nAs the speed of the diligence slackened, Hope put her head out of the\ncurtains, and as she surveyed the soldier with apparent surprise, she\nturned to her brother.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" she asked.  \"What are we waiting for?\"\n\n\"We are going to the Hacienda of Senor Palacio,\" MacWilliams said, in\nanswer to the officer.  \"The driver thinks that this is the road, but I\nsay we should have taken the one to the right.\"\n\n\"No, this is the road to Senor Palacio's plantation,\" the officer\nanswered, \"but you cannot leave the city without a pass signed by\nGeneral Mendoza.  That is the order we received this morning.  Have you\nsuch a pass?\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" Clay answered, warmly.  \"This is the carriage of an\nAmerican, the president of the mines.  His daughters are inside and on\ntheir way to visit the residence of Senor Palacio.  They are\nforeigners--Americans.  We are all foreigners, and we have a perfect\nright to leave the city when we choose.  You can only stop us when we\nenter it.\"\n\nThe officer looked uncertainly from Clay to Hope and up at the driver\non the box.  His eyes fell upon the heavy brass mountings of the\nharness.  They bore the arms of Olancho.  He wheeled sharply and called\nto his men inside the post-house, and they stepped out from the veranda\nand spread themselves leisurely across the road.\n\n\"Ride him down, Clay,\" Langham muttered, in a whisper.  The officer did\nnot understand the words, but he saw Clay gather the reins tighter in\nhis hands and he stepped back quickly to the safety of the porch, and\nfrom that ground of vantage smiled pleasantly.\n\n\"Pardon,\" he said, \"there is no need for blows when one is rich enough\nto pay.  A little something for myself and a drink for my brave\nfellows, and you can go where you please.\"\n\n\"Damned brigands,\" growled Langham, savagely.\n\n\"Not at all,\" Clay answered.  \"He is an officer and a gentleman.  I\nhave no money with me,\" he said, in Spanish, addressing the officer,\n\"but between caballeros a word of honor is sufficient.  I shall be\nreturning this way to-morrow morning, and I will bring a few hundred\nsols from Senor Palacio for you and your men; but if we are followed\nyou will get nothing, and you must have forgotten in the mean time that\nyou have seen us pass.\"\n\nThere was a murmur inside the carriage, and Hope's face disappeared\nfrom between the curtains to reappear again almost immediately.  She\nbeckoned to the officer with her hand, and the men saw that she held\nbetween her thumb and little finger a diamond ring of size and\nbrilliancy.  She moved it so that it flashed in the light of the guard\nlantern above the post-house.\n\n\"My sister tells me you shall be given this tomorrow morning,\" Hope\nsaid, \"if we are not followed.\"\n\nThe man's eyes laughed with pleasure.  He swept his sombrero to the\nground.\n\n\"I am your servant, Senorita,\" he said.  \"Gentlemen,\" he cried, gayly,\nturning to Clay, \"if you wish it, I will accompany you with my men.\nYes, I will leave word that I have gone in the sudden pursuit of\nsmugglers; or I will remain here as you wish, and send those who may\nfollow back again.\"\n\n\"You are most gracious, sir,\" said Clay.  \"It is always a pleasure to\nmeet with a gentleman and a philosopher.  We prefer to travel without\nan escort, and remember, you have seen nothing and heard nothing.\"  He\nleaned from the saddle, and touched the officer on the breast.  \"That\nring is worth a king's ransom.\"\n\n\"Or a president's,\" muttered the man, smiling.  \"Let the American\nladies pass,\" he commanded.\n\nThe soldiers scattered as the whip fell, and the horses once more\nleaped forward, and as the carriage entered the forest, Clay looked\nback and saw the officer exhaling the smoke of a fresh cigarette, with\nthe satisfaction of one who enjoys a clean conscience and a sense of\nduty well performed.\n\nThe road through the forest was narrow and uneven, and as the horses\nfell into a trot the men on horseback closed up together behind the\ncarriage.\n\n\"Do you think that road-agent will keep his word?\" Langham asked.\n\n\"Yes; he has nothing to win by telling the truth,\" Clay answered.  \"He\ncan say he saw a party of foreigners, Americans, driving in the\ndirection of Palacio's coffee plantation.  That lets him out, and in\nthe morning he knows he can levy on us for the gate money.  I am not so\nmuch afraid of being overtaken as I am that King may make a mistake and\nnot get to Bocos on time.  We ought to reach there, if the carriage\nholds together, by eleven. King should be there by eight o'clock, and\nthe yacht ought to make the run to Truxillo in three hours.  But we\nshall not be able to get back to the city before five to-morrow\nmorning.  I suppose your family will be wild about Hope.  We didn't\nknow where she was when we sent the groom back to King.\"\n\n\"Do you think that driver is taking us the right way?\" Langham asked,\nafter a pause.\n\n\"He'd better.  He knows it well enough.  He was through the last\nrevolution, and carried messages from Los Bocos to the city on foot for\ntwo months.  He has covered every trail on the way, and if he goes\nwrong he knows what will happen to him.\"\n\n\"And Los Bocos--it is a village, isn't it, and the landing must be in\nsight of the Custom-house?\"\n\n\"The village lies some distance back from the shore, and the only house\non the beach is the Custom-house itself; but every one will be asleep\nby the time we get there, and it will take us only a minute to hand her\ninto the launch.  If there should be a guard there, King will have\nfixed them one way or another by the time we arrive.  Anyhow, there is\nno need of looking for trouble that far ahead.  There is enough to\nworry about in between.  We haven't got there yet.\"\n\nThe moon rose grandly a few minutes later, and flooded the forest with\nlight so that the open places were as clear as day.  It threw strange\nshadows across the trail, and turned the rocks and fallen trees into\nfigures of men crouching or standing upright with uplifted arms.  They\nwere so like to them that Clay and Langham flung their carbines to\ntheir shoulders again and again, and pointed them at some black object\nthat turned as they advanced into wood or stone.  From the forest they\ncame to little streams and broad shallow rivers where the rocks in the\nfording places churned the water into white masses of foam, and the\nhorses kicked up showers of spray as they made their way, slipping and\nstumbling, against the current.  It was a silent pilgrimage, and never\nfor a moment did the strain slacken or the men draw rein.  Sometimes,\nas they hurried across a broad tableland, or skirted the edge of a\nprecipice and looked down hundreds of feet below at the shining waters\nthey had just forded, or up at the rocky points of the mountains before\nthem, the beauty of the night overcame them and made them forget the\nsignificance of their journey.\n\nThey were not always alone, for they passed at intervals through\nsleeping villages of mud huts with thatched roofs, where the dogs ran\nyelping out to bark at them, and where the pine-knots, blazing on the\nclay ovens, burned cheerily in the moonlight.  In the low lands where\nthe fever lay, the mist rose above the level of their heads and\nenshrouded them in a curtain of fog, and the dew fell heavily,\npenetrating their clothing and chilling their heated bodies so that the\nsweating horses moved in a lather of steam.\n\nThey had settled down into a steady gallop now, and ten or fifteen\nmiles had been left behind them.\n\n\"We are making excellent time,\" said Clay.  \"The village of San Lorenzo\nshould lie beyond that ridge.\"  He drove up beside the driver and\npointed with his whip.  \"Is not that San Lorenzo?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, senor,\" the man answered, \"but I mean to drive around it by the\nold wagon trail.  It is a large town, and people may be awake.  You\nwill be able to see it from the top of the next hill.\"\n\nThe cavalcade stopped at the summit of the ridge and the men looked\ndown into the silent village.  It was like the others they had passed,\nwith a few houses built round a square of grass that could hardly be\nrecognized as a plaza, except for the church on its one side, and the\nhuge wooden cross planted in its centre. From the top of the hill they\ncould see that the greater number of the houses were in darkness, but\nin a large building of two stories lights were shining from every\nwindow.\n\n\"That is the comandancia,\" said the driver, shaking his head.  \"They\nare still awake.  It is a telegraph station.\"\n\n\"Great Scott!\" exclaimed MacWilliams.  \"We forgot the telegraph.  They\nmay have sent word to head us off already.\"\n\n\"Nine o'clock is not so very late,\" said Clay.  \"It may mean nothing.\"\n\n\"We had better make sure, though,\" MacWilliams answered, jumping to the\nground.  \"Lend me your pony, Ted, and take my place.  I'll run in there\nand dust around and see what's up. I'll join you on the other side of\nthe town after you get back to the main road.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Clay.  \"What do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"I can't tell till I get there, but I'll try to find out how much they\nknow.  Don't you be afraid.  I'll run fast enough if there's any sign\nof trouble.  And if you come across a telegraph wire, cut it.  The\nmessage may not have gone over yet.\"\n\nThe two women in the carriage had parted the flaps of the hoods and\nwere trying to hear what was being said, but could not understand, and\nLangham explained to them that they were about to make a slight detour\nto avoid San Lorenzo while MacWilliams was going into it to\nreconnoitre.  He asked if they were comfortable, and assured them that\nthe greater part of the ride was over, and that there was a good road\nfrom San Lorenzo to the sea.\n\nMacWilliams rode down into the village along the main trail, and threw\nhis reins over a post in front of the comandancia.  He mounted boldly\nto the second floor of the building and stopped at the head of the\nstairs, in front of an open door.  There were three men in the room\nbefore him, one an elderly man, whom he rightly guessed was the\ncomandante, and two younger men who were standing behind a railing and\nbending over a telegraph instrument on a table.  As he stamped into the\nroom, they looked up and stared at him in surprise; their faces showed\nthat he had interrupted them at a moment of unusual interest.\n\nMacWilliams saluted the three men civilly, and, according to the native\ncustom, apologized for appearing before them in his spurs.\n\nHe had been riding from Los Bocos to the capital, he said, and his\nhorse had gone lame.  Could they tell him if there was any one in the\nvillage from whom he could hire a mule, as he must push on to the\ncapital that night?\n\nThe comandante surveyed him for a moment, as though still disturbed by\nthe interruption, and then shook his head impatiently.  \"You can hire a\nmule from one Pulido Paul, at the corner of the plaza,\" he said.  And\nas MacWilliams still stood uncertainly, he added, \"You say you have\ncome from Los Bocos.  Did you meet any one on your way?\"\n\nThe two younger men looked up at him anxiously, but before he could\nanswer, the instrument began to tick out the signal, and they turned\ntheir eyes to it again, and one of them began to take its message down\non paper.\n\nThe instrument spoke to MacWilliams also, for he was used to sending\ntelegrams daily from the office to the mines, and could make it talk\nfor him in either English or Spanish.  So, in his effort to hear what\nit might say, he stammered and glanced at it involuntarily, and the\ncomandante, without suspecting his reason for doing so, turned also and\npeered over the shoulder of the man who was receiving the message.\nExcept for the clicking of the instrument, the room was absolutely\nstill; the three men bent silently over the table, while MacWilliams\nstood gazing at the ceiling and turning his hat in his hands.  The\nmessage MacWilliams read from the instrument was this:  \"They are\nreported to have left the city by the south, so they are going to Para,\nor San Pedro, or to Los Bocos.  She must be stopped--take an armed\nforce and guard the roads.  If necessary, kill her.  She has in the\ncarriage or hidden on her person, drafts for five million sols.  You\nwill be held responsible for every one of them.  Repeat this message to\nshow you understand, and relay it to Los Bocos.  If you fail--\"\n\nMacWilliams could not wait to hear more; he gave a curt nod to the men\nand started toward the stairs.  \"Wait,\" the comandante called after him.\n\nMacWilliams paused with one hand on top of the banisters balancing\nhimself in readiness for instant flight.\n\n\"You have not answered me.  Did you meet with any one on your ride here\nfrom Los Bocos?\"\n\n\"I met several men on foot, and the mail carrier passed me a league out\nfrom the coast, and oh, yes, I met a carriage at the cross roads, and\nthe driver asked me the way of San Pedro Sula.\"\n\n\"A carriage?--yes--and what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I told him he was on the road to Los Bocos, and he turned back and--\"\n\n\"You are sure he turned back?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir.  I rode behind him for some distance.  He turned\nfinally to the right into the trail to San Pedro Sula.\"\n\nThe man flung himself across the railing.\n\n\"Quick,\" he commanded, \"telegraph to Morales, Comandante San Pedro\nSula--\"\n\nHe had turned his back on MacWilliams, and as the younger man bent over\nthe instrument, MacWilliams stepped softly down the stairs, and\nmounting his pony rode slowly off in the direction of the capital.  As\nsoon as he had reached the outskirts of the town, he turned and\ngalloped round it and then rode fast with his head in air, glancing up\nat the telegraph wire that sagged from tree-trunk to tree-trunk along\nthe trail.  At a point where he thought he could dismount in safety and\ntear down the wire, he came across it dangling from the branches and he\ngave a shout of relief.  He caught the loose end and dragged it free\nfrom its support, and then laying it across a rock pounded the blade of\nhis knife upon it with a stone, until he had hacked off a piece some\nfifty feet in length.  Taking this in his hand he mounted again and\nrode off with it, dragging the wire in the road behind him.  He held it\nup as he rejoined Clay, and laughed triumphantly.  \"They'll have some\ntrouble splicing that circuit,\" he said, \"you only half did the work.\nWhat wouldn't we give to know all this little piece of copper knows,\neh?\"\n\n\"Do you mean you think they have telegraphed to Los Bocos already?\"\n\n\"I know that they were telegraphing to San Pedro Sula as I left and to\nall the coast towns.  But whether you cut this down before or after is\nwhat I should like to know.\"\n\n\"We shall probably learn that later,\" said Clay, grimly.\n\nThe last three miles of the journey lay over a hard, smooth road, wide\nenough to allow the carriage and its escort to ride abreast.\n\nIt was in such contrast to the tortuous paths they had just followed,\nthat the horses gained a fresh impetus and galloped forward as freely\nas though the race had but just begun.\n\nMadame Alvarez stopped the carriage at one place and asked the men to\nlower the hood at the back that she might feel the fresh air and see\nabout her, and when this had been done, the women seated themselves\nwith their backs to the horses where they could look out at the moonlit\nroad as it unrolled behind them.\n\nHope felt selfishly and wickedly happy.  The excitement had kept her\nspirits at the highest point, and the knowledge that Clay was guarding\nand protecting her was in itself a pleasure.  She leaned back on the\ncushions and put her arm around the older woman's waist, and listened\nto the light beat of his pony's hoofs outside, now running ahead, now\nscrambling and slipping up some steep place, and again coming to a halt\nas Langham or MacWilliams called, \"Look to the right, behind those\ntrees,\" or \"Ahead there!  Don't you see what I mean, something\ncrouching?\"\n\nShe did not know when the false alarms would turn into a genuine\nattack, but she was confident that when the time came he would take\ncare of her, and she welcomed the danger because it brought that solace\nwith it.\n\nMadame Alvarez sat at her side, rigid, silent, and beyond the help of\ncomfort.  She tortured herself with thoughts of the ambitions she had\nheld, and which had been so cruelly mocked that very morning; of the\nchivalric love that had been hers, of the life even that had been hers,\nand which had been given up for her so tragically.  When she spoke at\nall, it was to murmur her sorrow that Hope had exposed herself to\ndanger on her poor account, and that her life, as far as she loved it,\nwas at an end.  Only once after the men had parted the curtains and\nasked concerning her comfort with grave solicitude did she give way to\ntears.\n\n\"Why are they so good to me?\" she moaned.  \"Why are you so good to me?\nI am a wicked, vain woman, I have brought a nation to war and I have\nkilled the only man I ever trusted.\"\n\nHope touched her gently with her hand and felt guiltily how selfish she\nherself must be not to feel the woman's grief, but she could not.  She\nonly saw in it a contrast to her own happiness, a black background\nbefore which the figure of Clay and his solicitude for her shone out,\nthe only fact in the world that was of value.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted by the carriage coming to a halt, and a\nsignificant movement upon the part of the men.  MacWilliams had\ndescended from the box-seat and stepping into the carriage took the\nplace the women had just left.\n\nHe had a carbine in his hand, and after he was seated Langham handed\nhim another which he laid across his knees.\n\n\"They thought I was too conspicuous on the box to do any good there,\"\nhe explained in a confidential whisper.  \"In case there is any firing\nnow, you ladies want to get down on your knees here at my feet, and\nhide your heads in the cushions.  We are entering Los Bocos.\"\n\nLangham and Clay were riding far in advance, scouting to the right and\nleft, and the carriage moved noiselessly behind them through the empty\nstreets.  There was no light in any of the windows, and not even a dog\nbarked, or a cock crowed.  The women sat erect, listening for the first\nsignal of an attack, each holding the other's hand and looking at\nMacWilliams, who sat with his thumb on the trigger of his carbine,\nglancing to the right and left and breathing quickly.  His eyes\ntwinkled, like those of a little fox terrier.  The men dropped back,\nand drew up on a level with the carriage.\n\n\"We are all right, so far,\" Clay whispered.  \"The beach slopes down\nfrom the other side of that line of trees.  What is the matter with\nyou?\" he demanded, suddenly, looking up at the driver, \"are you afraid?\"\n\n\"No,\" the man answered, hurriedly, his voice shaking; \"it's the cold.\"\n\nLangham had galloped on ahead and as he passed through the trees and\ncame out upon the beach, he saw a broad stretch of moonlit water and\nthe lights from the yacht shining from a point a quarter of a mile off\nshore.  Among the rocks on the edge of the beach was the \"Vesta's\"\nlongboat and her crew seated in it or standing about on the beach.  The\ncarriage had stopped under the protecting shadow of the trees, and he\nraced back toward it.\n\n\"The yacht is here,\" he cried.  \"The long-boat is waiting and there is\nnot a sign of light about the Custom-house.  Come on,\" he cried.  \"We\nhave beaten them after all.\"\n\nA sailor, who had been acting as lookout on the rocks, sprang to his\nfull height, and shouted to the group around the long-boat, and King\ncame up the beach toward them running heavily through the deep sand.\n\nMadame Alvarez stepped down from the carriage, and as Hope handed her\nher jewel case in silence, the men draped her cloak about her\nshoulders.  She put out her hand to them, and as Clay took it in his,\nshe bent her head quickly and kissed his hand.  \"You were his friend,\"\nshe murmured.\n\nShe held Hope in her arms for an instant, and kissed her, and then gave\nher hand in turn to Langham and to MacWilliams.\n\n\"I do not know whether I shall ever see you again,\" she said, looking\nslowly from one to the other, \"but I will pray for you every day, and\nGod will reward you for saving a worthless life.\"\n\nAs she finished speaking King came up to the group, followed by three\nof his men.\n\n\"Is Hope with you, is she safe?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, she is with me,\" Madame Alvarez answered.\n\n\"Thank God,\" King exclaimed, breathlessly.  \"Then we will start at\nonce, Madame.  Where is she?  She must come with us!\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Clay-assented, eagerly, \"she will be much safer on the\nyacht.\"\n\nBut Hope protested.  \"I must get back to father,\" she said. \"The yacht\nwill not arrive until late to-morrow, and the carriage can take me to\nhim five hours earlier.  The family have worried too long about me as\nit is, and, besides, I will not leave Ted.  I am going back as I came.\"\n\n\"It is most unsafe,\" King urged.\n\n\"On the contrary, it is perfectly safe now,\" Hope answered. \"It was not\none of us they wanted.\"\n\n\"You may be right,\" King said.  \"They don't know what has happened to\nyou, and perhaps after all it would be better if you went back the\nquicker way.\"  He gave his arm to Madame Alvarez and walked with her\ntoward the shore.  As the men surrounded her on every side and moved\naway, Clay glanced back at Hope and saw her standing upright in the\ncarriage looking after them.\n\n\"We will be with you in a minute,\" he called, as though in apology for\nleaving her for even that brief space.  And then the shadow of the\ntrees shut her and the carriage from his sight. His footsteps made no\nsound in the soft sand, and except for the whispering of the palms and\nthe sleepy wash of the waves as they ran up the pebbly beach and sank\nagain, the place was as peaceful and silent as a deserted island,\nthough the moon made it as light as day.\n\nThe long-boat had been drawn up with her stern to the shore, and the\nmen were already in their places, some standing waiting for the order\nto shove off, and others seated balancing their oars.\n\nKing had arranged to fire a rocket when the launch left the shore, in\norder that the captain of the yacht might run in closer to pick them\nup.  As he hurried down the beach, he called to his boatswain to give\nthe signal, and the man answered that he understood and stooped to\nlight a match.  King had jumped into the stern and lifted Madame\nAlvarez after him, leaving her late escort standing with uncovered\nheads on the beach behind her, when the rocket shot up into the calm\nwhite air, with a roar and a rush and a sudden flash of color.  At the\nsame instant, as though in answer to its challenge, the woods back of\nthem burst into an irregular line of flame, a volley of rifle shots\nshattered the silence, and a score of bullets splashed in the water and\non the rocks about them.\n\nThe boatswain in the bow of the long-boat tossed up his arms and\npitched forward between the thwarts.\n\n\"Give way,\" he shouted as he fell.\n\n\"Pull,\" Clay yelled, \"pull, all of you.\"\n\nHe threw himself against the stern of the boat, and Langham and\nMacWilliams clutched its sides, and with their shoulders against it and\ntheir bodies half sunk in the water, shoved it off, free of the shore.\n\nThe shots continued fiercely, and two of the crew cried out and fell\nback upon the oars of the men behind them.\n\nMadame Alvarez sprang to her feet and stood swaying unsteadily as the\nboat leaped forward.\n\n\"Take me back.  Stop, I command you,\" she cried, \"I will not leave\nthose men.  Do you hear?\"\n\nKing caught her by the waist and dragged her down, but she struggled to\nfree herself.  \"I will not leave them to be murdered,\" she cried.  \"You\ncowards, put me back.\"\n\n\"Hold her, King,\" Clay shouted.  \"We're all right.  They're not firing\nat us.\"\n\nHis voice was drowned in the noise of the oars beating in the rowlocks,\nand the reports of the rifles.  The boat disappeared in a mist of spray\nand moonlight, and Clay turned and faced about him.  Langham and\nMacWilliams were crouching behind a rock and firing at the flashes in\nthe woods.\n\n\"You can't stay there,\" Clay cried.  \"We must get back to Hope.\"\n\nHe ran forward, dodging from side to side and firing as he ran. He\nheard shots from the water, and looking back saw that the men in the\nlongboat had ceased rowing, and were returning the fire from the shore.\n\n\"Come back, Hope is all right,\" her brother called to him.  \"I haven't\nseen a shot within a hundred yards of her yet, they're firing from the\nCustom-house and below.  I think Mac's hit.\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" MacWilliams's voice answered from behind a rock, \"but I'd\nlike to see something to shoot at.\"\n\nA hot tremor of rage swept over Clay at the thought of a possibly fatal\ntermination to the night's adventure.  He groaned at the mockery of\nhaving found his life only to lose it now, when it was more precious to\nhim than it had ever been, and to lose it in a silly brawl with\nsemi-savages.  He cursed himself impotently and rebelliously for a\nsenseless fool.\n\n\"Keep back, can't you?\" he heard Langham calling to him from the shore.\n\"You're only drawing the fire toward Hope.  She's got away by now.  She\nhad both the horses.\"\n\nLangham and MacWilliams started forward to Clay's side, but the instant\nthey left the shadow of the rock, the bullets threw up the sand at\ntheir feet and they stopped irresolutely.  The moon showed the three\nmen outlined against the white sand of the beach as clearly as though a\nsearchlight had been turned upon them, even while its shadows sheltered\nand protected their assailants. At their backs the open sea cut off\nretreat, and the line of fire in front held them in check.  They were\nas helpless as chessmen upon a board.\n\n\"I'm not going to stand still to be shot at,\" cried MacWilliams.\n\"Let's hide or let's run.  This isn't doing anybody any good.\"  But no\none moved.  They could hear the singing of the bullets as they passed\nthem whining in the air like a banjo-string that is being tightened,\nand they knew they were in equal danger from those who were firing from\nthe boat.\n\n\"They're shooting better,\" said MacWilliams.  \"They'll reach us in a\nminute.\"\n\n\"They've reached me already, I think,\" Langham answered, with\nsuppressed satisfaction, \"in the shoulder.  It's nothing.\"  His\nunconcern was quite sincere; to a young man who had galloped through\ntwo long halves of a football match on a strained tendon, a scratched\nshoulder was not important, except as an unsought honor.\n\nBut it was of the most importance to MacWilliams.  He raised his voice\nagainst the men in the woods in impotent fury.  \"Come out, you cowards,\nwhere we can see you,\" he cried.  \"Come out where I can shoot your\nblack heads off.\"\n\nClay had fired the last cartridge in his rifle, and throwing it away\ndrew his revolver.\n\n\"We must either swim or hide,\" he said.  \"Put your heads down and run.\"\n\nBut as he spoke, they saw the carriage plunging out of the shadow of\nthe woods and the horses galloping toward them down the beach.\nMacWilliams gave a cheer of welcome.  \"Hurrah!\" he shouted, \"it's Jose'\ncoming for us.  He's a good man.  Well done, Jose'!\" he called.\n\n\"That's not Jose',\" Langham cried, doubtfully, peering through the\nmoonlight.  \"Good God!  It's Hope,\" he exclaimed. He waved his hands\nfrantically above his head.  \"Go back, Hope,\" he cried, \"go back!\"\n\nBut the carriage did not swerve on its way toward them.  They all saw\nher now distinctly.  She was on the driver's box and alone, leaning\nforward and lashing the horses' backs with the whip and reins, and\nbending over to avoid the bullets that passed above her head.  As she\ncame down upon them, she stood up, her woman's figure outlined clearly\nin the riding habit she still wore. \"Jump in when I turn,\" she cried.\n\"I'm going to turn slowly, run and jump in.\"\n\nShe bent forward again and pulled the horses to the right, and as they\nobeyed her, plunging and tugging at their bits, as though they knew the\ndanger they were in, the men threw themselves at the carriage.  Clay\ncaught the hood at the back, swung himself up, and scrambled over the\ncushions and up to the box seat.  He dropped down behind Hope, and\nreaching his arms around her took the reins in one hand, and with the\nother forced her down to her knees upon the footboard, so that, as she\nknelt, his arms and body protected her from the bullets sent after\nthem.  Langham followed Clay, and tumbled into the carriage over the\nhood at the back, but MacWilliams endeavored to vault in from the step,\nand missing his footing fell under the hind wheel, so that the weight\nof the carriage passed over him, and his head was buried for an instant\nin the sand.  But he was on his feet again before they had noticed that\nhe was down, and as he jumped for the hood, Langham caught him by the\ncollar of his coat and dragged him into the seat, panting and gasping,\nand rubbing the sand from his mouth and nostrils.  Clay turned the\ncarriage at a right angle through the heavy sand, and still standing\nwith Hope crouched at his knees, he raced back to the woods into the\nface of the firing, with the boys behind him answering it from each\nside of the carriage, so that the horses leaped forward in a frenzy of\nterror, and dashing through the woods, passed into the first road that\nopened before them.\n\nThe road into which they had turned was narrow, but level, and ran\nthrough a forest of banana palms that bent and swayed above them.\nLangham and MacWilliams still knelt in the rear seat of the carriage,\nwatching the road on the chance of possible pursuit.\n\n\"Give me some cartridges,\" said Langham.  \"My belt is empty. What road\nis this?\"\n\n\"It is a private road, I should say, through somebody's banana\nplantation.  But it must cross the main road somewhere.  It doesn't\nmatter, we're all right now.  I mean to take it easy.\" MacWilliams\nturned on his back and stretched out his legs on the seat opposite.\n\n\"Where do you suppose those men sprang from?  Were they following us\nall the time?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, or else that message got over the wire before we cut it, and\nthey've been lying in wait for us.  They were probably watching King\nand his sailors for the last hour or so, but they didn't want him.\nThey wanted her and the money.  It was pretty exciting, wasn't it?\nHow's your shoulder?\"\n\n\"It's a little stiff, thank you,\" said Langham.  He stood up and by\npeering over the hood could just see the top of Clay's sombrero rising\nabove it where he sat on the back seat.\n\n\"You and Hope all right up there, Clay?\" he asked.\n\nThe top of the sombrero moved slightly, and Langham took it as a sign\nthat all was well.  He dropped back into his seat beside MacWilliams,\nand they both breathed a long sigh of relief and content.  Langham's\nwounded arm was the one nearest MacWilliams, and the latter parted the\ntorn sleeve and examined the furrow across the shoulder with\nunconcealed envy.\n\n\"I am afraid it won't leave a scar,\" he said, sympathetically.\n\n\"Won't it?\" asked Langham, in some concern.\n\nThe horses had dropped into a walk, and the beauty of the moonlit night\nput its spell upon the two boys, and the rustling of the great leaves\nabove their heads stilled and quieted them so that they unconsciously\nspoke in whispers.\n\nClay had not moved since the horses turned of their own accord into the\nvalley of the palms.  He no longer feared pursuit nor any interruption\nto their further progress.  His only sensation was one of utter\nthankfulness that they were all well out of it, and that Hope had been\nthe one who had helped them in their trouble, and his dearest thought\nwas that, whether she wished or not, he owed his safety, and possibly\nhis life, to her.\n\nShe still crouched between his knees upon the broad footboard, with her\nhands clasped in front of her, and looking ahead into the vista of soft\nmysterious lights and dark shadows that the moon cast upon the road.\nNeither of them spoke, and as the silence continued unbroken, it took a\nweightier significance, and at each added second of time became more\nfull of meaning.\n\nThe horses had dropped into a tired walk, and drew them smoothly over\nthe white road; from behind the hood came broken snatches of the boys'\ntalk, and above their heads the heavy leaves of the palms bent and\nbowed as though in benediction.  A warm breeze from the land filled the\nair with the odor of ripening fruit and pungent smells, and the silence\nseemed to envelop them and mark them as the only living creatures awake\nin the brilliant tropical night.\n\nHope sank slowly back, and as she did so, her shoulder touched for an\ninstant against Clay's knee; she straightened herself and made a\nmovement as though to rise.  Her nearness to him and something in her\nattitude at his feet held Clay in a spell.  He bent forward and laid\nhis hand fearfully upon her shoulder, and the touch seemed to stop the\nblood in his veins and hushed the words upon his lips.  Hope raised her\nhead slowly as though with a great effort, and looked into his eyes.\nIt seemed to him that he had been looking into those same eyes for\ncenturies, as though he had always known them, and the soul that looked\nout of them into his.  He bent his head lower, and stretching out his\narms drew her to him, and the eyes did not waver.  He raised her and\nheld her close against his breast.  Her eyes faltered and closed.\n\n\"Hope,\" he whispered, \"Hope.\"  He stooped lower and kissed her, and his\nlips told her what they could not speak--and they were quite alone.\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nAn hour later Langham rose with a protesting sigh and shook the hood\nviolently.\n\n\"I say!\" he called.  \"Are you asleep up there.  We'll never get home at\nthis rate.  Doesn't Hope want to come back here and go to sleep?\"\n\nThe carriage stopped, and the boys tumbled out and walked around in\nfront of it.  Hope sat smiling on the box-seat.  She was apparently far\nfrom sleepy, and she was quite contented where she was, she told him.\n\n\"Do you know we haven't had anything to eat since yesterday at\nbreakfast?\" asked Langham.  \"MacWilliams and I are fainting. We move\nthat we stop at the next shack we come to, and waken the people up and\nmake them give us some supper.\"\n\nHope looked aside at Clay and laughed softly.  \"Supper?\" she said.\n\"They want supper!\"\n\nTheir suffering did not seem to impress Clay deeply.  He sat snapping\nhis whip at the palm-trees above him, and smiled happily in an\ninconsequent and irritating manner at nothing.\n\n\"See here!  Do you know that we are lost?\" demanded Langham,\nindignantly, \"and starving?  Have you any idea at all where you are?\"\n\n\"I have not,\" said Clay, cheerfully.  \"All I know is that a long time\nago there was a revolution and a woman with jewels, who escaped in an\nopen boat, and I recollect playing that I was a target and standing up\nto be shot at in a bright light.  After that I woke up to the really\nimportant things of life--among which supper is not one.\"\n\nLangham and MacWilliams looked at each other doubtfully, and Langham\nshook his head.\n\n\"Get down off that box,\" he commanded.  \"If you and Hope think this is\nmerely a pleasant moonlight drive, we don't.  You two can sit in the\ncarriage now, and we'll take a turn at driving, and we'll guarantee to\nget you to some place soon.\"\n\nClay and Hope descended meekly and seated themselves under the hood,\nwhere they could look out upon the moonlit road as it unrolled behind\nthem.  But they were no longer to enjoy their former leisurely\nprogress.  The new whip lashed his horses into a gallop, and the trees\nflew past them on either hand.\n\n\"Do you remember that chap in the 'Last Ride Together'?\" said Clay.\n\n    \"I and my mistress, side by side,\n        Shall be together--forever ride,\n      And so one more day am I deified.\n        Who knows--the world may end to-night.\"\n\nHope laughed triumphantly, and threw out her arms as though she would\nembrace the whole beautiful world that stretched around them.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she laughed.  \"To-night the world has just begun.\"\n\nThe carriage stopped, and there was a confusion of voices on the\nbox-seat, and then a great barking of dogs, and they beheld MacWilliams\nbeating and kicking at the door of a hut.  The door opened for an inch,\nand there was a long debate in Spanish, and finally the door was closed\nagain, and a light appeared through the windows.  A few minutes later a\nman and woman came out of the hut, shivering and yawning, and made a\nfire in the sun-baked oven at the side of the house.  Hope and Clay\nremained seated in the carriage, and watched the flames springing up\nfrom the oily fagots, and the boys moving about with flaring torches of\npine, pulling down bundles of fodder for the horses from the roof of\nthe kitchen, while two sleepy girls disappeared toward a mountain\nstream, one carrying a jar on her shoulder, and the other lighting the\nway with a torch.  Hope sat with her chin on her hand, watching the\nblack figures passing between them and the fire, and standing above it\nwith its light on their faces, shading their eyes from the heat with\none hand, and stirring something in a smoking caldron with the other.\nHope felt an overflowing sense of gratitude to these simple strangers\nfor the trouble they were taking.  She felt how good every one was, and\nhow wonderfully kind and generous was the world that she lived in.\n\nHer brother came over to the carriage and bowed with mock courtesy.\n\n\"I trust, now that we have done all the work,\" he said, \"that your\nexcellencies will condescend to share our frugal fare, or must we bring\nit to you here?\"\n\nThe clay oven stood in the middle of a hut of laced twigs, through\nwhich the smoke drifted freely.  There was a row of wooden benches\naround it, and they all seated themselves and ate ravenously of rice\nand fried plantains, while the woman patted and tossed tortillas\nbetween her hands, eyeing her guests curiously.  Her glance fell upon\nLangham's shoulder, and rested there for so long that Hope followed the\ndirection of her eyes. She leaped to her feet with a cry of fear and\nreproach, and ran toward her brother.\n\n\"Ted!\" she cried, \"you are hurt! you are wounded, and you never told\nme!  What is it?  Is it very bad?\" Clay crossed the floor in a stride,\nhis face full of concern.\n\n\"Leave me alone!\" cried the stern brother, backing away and warding\nthem off with the coffeepot.  \"It's only scratched. You'll spill the\ncoffee.\"\n\nBut at the sight of the blood Hope had turned very white, and throwing\nher arms around her brother's neck, hid her eyes on his other shoulder\nand began to cry.\n\n\"I am so selfish,\" she sobbed.  \"I have been so happy and you were\nsuffering all the time.\"\n\nHer brother stared at the others in dismay.  \"What nonsense,\" he said,\npatting her on the shoulder.  \"You're a bit tired, and you need rest.\nThat's what you need.  The idea of my sister going off in hysterics\nafter behaving like such a sport--and before these young ladies, too.\nAren't you ashamed?\"\n\n\"I should think they'd be ashamed,\" said MacWilliams, severely, as he\ncontinued placidly with his supper.  \"They haven't got enough clothes\non.\"\n\nLangham looked over Hope's shoulder at Clay and nodded significantly.\n\"She's been on a good deal of a strain,\" he explained apologetically,\n\"and no wonder; it's been rather an unusual night for her.\"\n\nHope raised her head and smiled at him through her tears.  Then she\nturned and moved toward Clay.  She brushed her eyes with the back of\nher hand and laughed.  \"It has been an unusual night,\" she said.\n\"Shall I tell him?\" she asked.\n\nClay straightened himself unconsciously, and stepped beside her and\ntook her hand; MacWilliams quickly lowered to the bench the dish from\nwhich he was eating, and stood up, too.  The people of the house stared\nat the group in the firelight with puzzled interest, at the beautiful\nyoung girl, and at the tall, sunburned young man at her side.  Langham\nlooked from his sister to Clay and back again, and laughed uneasily.\n\n\"Langham, I have been very bold,\" said Clay.  \"I have asked your sister\nto marry me--and she has said that she would.\"\n\nLangham flushed as red as his sister.  He felt himself at a\ndisadvantage in the presence of a love as great and strong as he knew\nthis must be.  It made him seem strangely young and inadequate.  He\ncrossed over to his sister awkwardly and kissed her, and then took\nClay's hand, and the three stood together and looked at one another,\nand there was no sign of doubt or question in the face of any one of\nthem.  They stood so for some little time, smiling and exclaiming\ntogether, and utterly unconscious of anything but their own delight and\nhappiness.  MacWilliams watched them, his face puckered into odd\nwrinkles and his eyes half-closed.  Hope suddenly broke away from the\nothers and turned toward him with her hands held out.\n\n\"Have you nothing to say to me, Mr. MacWilliams?\" she asked.\n\nMacWilliams looked doubtfully at Clay, as though from force of habit he\nmust ask advice from his chief first, and then took the hands that she\nheld out to him and shook them up and down.  His usual confidence\nseemed to have forsaken him, and he stood, shifting from one foot to\nthe other, smiling and abashed.\n\n\"Well, I always said they didn't make them any better than you,\" he\ngasped at last.  \"I was always telling him that, wasn't I?\"  He nodded\nenergetically at Clay.  \"And that's so; they don't make 'em any better\nthan you.\"\n\nHe dropped her hands and crossed over to Clay, and stood surveying him\nwith a smile of wonder and admiration.\n\n\"How'd you do it?\" he demanded.  \"How did you do it?  I suppose you\nknow,\" he asked sternly, \"that you're not good enough for Miss Hope?\nYou know that, don't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I know that,\" said Clay.\n\nMacWilliams walked toward the door and stood in it for a second,\nlooking back at them over his shoulder.  \"They don't make them any\nbetter than that,\" he reiterated gravely, and disappeared in the\ndirection of the horses, shaking his head and muttering his\nastonishment and delight.\n\n\"Please give me some money,\" Hope said to Clay.  \"All the money you\nhave,\" she added, smiling at her presumption of authority over him,\n\"and you, too, Ted.\"  The men emptied their pockets, and Hope poured\nthe mass of silver into the hands of the women, who gazed at it\nuncomprehendingly.\n\n\"Thank you for your trouble and your good supper,\" Hope said in\nSpanish, \"and may no evil come to your house.\"\n\nThe woman and her daughters followed her to the carriage, bowing and\nuttering good wishes in the extravagant metaphor of their country; and\nas they drove away, Hope waved her hand to them as she sank closer\nagainst Clay's shoulder.\n\n\"The world is full of such kind and gentle souls,\" she said.\n\nIn an hour they had regained the main road, and a little later the\nstars grew dim and the moonlight faded, and trees and bushes and rocks\nbegan to take substance and to grow into form and outline.  They saw by\nthe cool, gray light of the morning the familiar hills around the\ncapital, and at a cry from the boys on the box-seat, they looked ahead\nand beheld the harbor of Valencia at their feet, lying as placid and\nundisturbed as the water in a bath-tub.  As they turned up the hill\ninto the road that led to the Palms, they saw the sleeping capital like\na city of the dead below them, its white buildings reddened with the\nlight of the rising sun.  From three places in different parts of the\ncity, thick columns of smoke rose lazily to the sky.\n\n\"I had forgotten!\" said Clay; \"they have been having a revolution here.\nIt seems so long ago.\"\n\nBy five o'clock they had reached the gate of the Palms, and their\nappearance startled the sentry on post into a state of undisciplined\njoy.  A riderless pony, the one upon which Jose' had made his escape\nwhen the firing began, had crept into the stable an hour previous,\nstiff and bruised and weary, and had led the people at the Palms to\nfear the worst.\n\nMr. Langham and his daughter were standing on the veranda as the horses\ncame galloping up the avenue.  They had been awake all the night, and\nthe face of each was white and drawn with anxiety and loss of sleep.\nMr. Langham caught Hope in his arms and held her face close to his in\nsilence.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" he said at last.  \"Why did you treat me like\nthis?  You knew how I would suffer.\"\n\n\"I could not help it,\" Hope cried.  \"I had to go with Madame Alvarez.\"\n\nHer sister had suffered as acutely as had Mr. Langham himself, as long\nas she was in ignorance of Hope's whereabouts.  But now that she saw\nHope in the flesh again, she felt a reaction against her for the\nanxiety and distress she had caused them.\n\n\"My dear Hope,\" she said, \"is every one to be sacrificed for Madame\nAlvarez?  What possible use could you be to her at such a time?  It was\nnot the time nor the place for a young girl.  You were only another\nresponsibility for the men.\"\n\n\"Clay seemed willing to accept the responsibility,\" said Langham,\nwithout a smile.  \"And, besides,\" he added, \"if Hope had not been with\nus we might never have reached home alive.\"\n\nBut it was only after much earnest protest and many explanations that\nMr. Langham was pacified, and felt assured that his son's wound was not\ndangerous, and that his daughter was quite safe.\n\nMiss Langham and himself, he said, had passed a trying night. There had\nbeen much firing in the city, and continual uproar. The houses of\nseveral of the friends of Alvarez had been burned and sacked.  Alvarez\nhimself had been shot as soon as he had entered the yard of the\nmilitary prison.  It was then given out that he had committed suicide.\nMendoza had not dared to kill Rojas, because of the feeling of the\npeople toward him, and had even shown him to the mob from behind the\nbars of one of the windows in order to satisfy them that he was still\nliving.  The British Minister had sent to the Palace for the body of\nCaptain Stuart, and had had it escorted to the Legation, from whence it\nwould be sent to England.  This, as far as Mr. Langham had heard, was\nthe news of the night just over.\n\n\"Two native officers called here for you about midnight, Clay,\" he\ncontinued, \"and they are still waiting for you below at your office.\nThey came from Rojas's troops, who are encamped on the hills at the\nother side of the city.  They wanted you to join them with the men from\nthe mines.  I told them I did not know when you would return, and they\nsaid they would wait.  If you could have been here last night, it is\npossible that we might have done something, but now that it is all\nover, I am glad that you saved that woman instead.  I should have\nliked, though, to have struck one blow at them.  But we cannot hope to\nwin against assassins.  The death of young Stuart has hurt me terribly,\nand the murder of Alvarez, coming on top of it, has made me wish I had\nnever heard of nor seen Olancho.  I have decided to go away at once, on\nthe next steamer, and I will take my daughters with me, and Ted, too.\nThe State Department at Washington can fight with Mendoza for the\nmines.  You made a good stand, but they made a better one, and they\nhave beaten us.  Mendoza's coup d'etat has passed into history, and the\nrevolution is at an end.\"\n\nOn his arrival Clay had at once asked for a cigar, and while Mr.\nLangham was speaking he had been biting it between his teeth, with the\nserious satisfaction of a man who had been twelve hours without one.\nHe knocked the ashes from it and considered the burning end\nthoughtfully.  Then he glanced at Hope as she stood among the group on\nthe veranda.  She was waiting for his reply and watching him intently.\nHe seemed to be confident that she would approve of the only course he\nsaw open to him.\n\n\"The revolution is not at an end by any means, Mr. Langham,\" he said at\nlast, simply.  \"It has just begun.\"  He turned abruptly and walked away\nin the direction of the office, and MacWilliams and Langham stepped off\nthe veranda and followed him as a matter of course.\n\nThe soldiers in the army who were known to be faithful to General Rojas\nbelonged to the Third and Fourth regiments, and numbered four thousand\non paper, and two thousand by count of heads. When they had seen their\nleader taken prisoner, and swept off the parade-ground by Mendoza's\ncavalry, they had first attempted to follow in pursuit and recapture\nhim, but the men on horseback had at once shaken off the men on foot\nand left them, panting and breathless, in the dust behind them.  So\nthey halted uncertainly in the road, and their young officers held\ncounsel together. They first considered the advisability of attacking\nthe military prison, but decided against doing so, as it would lead,\nthey feared, whether it proved successful or not, to the murder of\nRojas.  It was impossible to return to the city where Mendoza's First\nand Second regiments greatly outnumbered them.  Having no leader and no\nheadquarters, the officers marched the men to the hills above the city\nand went into camp to await further developments.\n\nThroughout the night they watched the illumination of the city and of\nthe boats in the harbor below them; they saw the flames bursting from\nthe homes of the members of Alvarez's Cabinet, and when the morning\nbroke they beheld the grounds of the Palace swarming with Mendoza's\ntroops, and the red and white barred flag of the revolution floating\nover it.  The news of the assassination of Alvarez and the fact that\nRojas had been spared for fear of the people, had been carried to them\nearly in the evening, and with this knowledge of their General's safety\nhope returned and fresh plans were discussed.  By midnight they had\ndefinitely decided that should Mendoza attempt to dislodge them the\nnext morning, they would make a stand, but that if the fight went\nagainst them, they would fall back along the mountain roads to the\nValencia mines, where they hoped to persuade the fifteen hundred\nsoldiers there installed to join forces with them against the new\nDictator.\n\nIn order to assure themselves of this help, a messenger was despatched\nby a circuitous route to the Palms, to ask the aid of the resident\ndirector, and another was sent to the mines to work upon the feelings\nof the soldiers themselves.  The officer who had been sent to the Palms\nto petition Clay for the loan of his soldier-workmen, had decided to\nremain until Clay returned, and another messenger had been sent after\nhim from the camp on the same errand.\n\nThese two lieutenants greeted Clay with enthusiasm, but he at once\ninterrupted them, and began plying them with questions as to where\ntheir camp was situated and what roads led from it to the Palms.\n\n\"Bring your men at once to this end of our railroad,\" he said.  \"It is\nstill early, and the revolutionists will sleep late.  They are drugged\nwith liquor and worn out with excitement, and whatever may have been\ntheir intentions toward you last night, they will be late in putting\nthem into practice this morning.  I will telegraph Kirkland to come up\nat once with all of his soldiers and with his three hundred Irishmen.\nAllowing him a half-hour to collect them and to get his flat cars\ntogether, and another half-hour in which to make the run, he should be\nhere by half-past six--and that's quick mobilization. You ride back now\nand march your men here at a double-quick. With your two thousand we\nshall have in all three thousand and eight hundred men.  I must have\nabsolute control over my own troops.  Otherwise I shall act\nindependently of you and go into the city alone with my workmen.\"\n\n\"That is unnecessary,\" said one of the lieutenants.  \"We have no\nofficers.  If you do not command us, there is no one else to do it.  We\npromise that our men will follow you and give you every obedience.\nThey have been led by foreigners before, by young Captain Stuart and\nMajor Fergurson and Colonel Shrevington. They know how highly General\nRojas thinks of you, and they know that you have led Continental armies\nin Europe.\"\n\n\"Well, don't tell them I haven't until this is over,\" said Clay.  \"Now,\nride hard, gentlemen, and bring your men here as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe lieutenants thanked him effusively and galloped away, radiant at\nthe success of their mission, and Clay entered the office where\nMacWilliams was telegraphing his orders to Kirkland.  He seated himself\nbeside the instrument, and from time to time answered the questions\nKirkland sent back to him over the wire, and in the intervals of\nsilence thought of Hope.  It was the first time he had gone into action\nfeeling the touch of a woman's hand upon his sleeve, and he was fearful\nlest she might think he had considered her too lightly.\n\nHe took a piece of paper from the table and wrote a few lines upon it,\nand then rewrote them several times.  The message he finally sent to\nher was this:  \"I am sure you understand, and that you would not have\nme give up beaten now, when what we do to-day may set us right again.\nI know better than any one else in the world can know, what I run the\nrisk of losing, but you would not have that fear stop me from going on\nwith what we have been struggling for so long.  I cannot come back to\nsee you before we start, but I know your heart is with me.  With great\nlove, Robert Clay.\"\n\nHe gave the note to his servant, and the answer was brought to him\nalmost immediately.  Hope had not rewritten her message: \"I love you\nbecause you are the sort of man you are, and had you given up as father\nwished you to do, or on my account, you would have been some one else,\nand I would have had to begin over again to learn to love you for some\ndifferent reasons.  I know that you will come back to me bringing your\nsheaves with you.  Nothing can happen to you now.  Hope.\"\n\nHe had never received a line from her before, and he read and reread\nthis with a sense of such pride and happiness in his face that\nMacWilliams smiled covertly and bent his eyes upon his instrument.\nClay went back into his room and kissed the page of paper gently,\nflushing like a boy as he did so, and then folding it carefully, he put\nit away beneath his jacket.  He glanced about him guiltily, although he\nwas quite alone, and taking out his watch, pried it open and looked\ndown into the face of the photograph that had smiled up at him from it\nfor so many years. He thought how unlike it was to Alice Langham as he\nknew her.  He judged that it must have been taken when she was very\nyoung, at the age Hope was then, before the little world she lived in\nhad crippled and narrowed her and marked her for its own.  He\nremembered what she had said to him the first night he had seen her.\n\"That is the picture of the girl who ceased to exist four years ago,\nand whom you have never met.\"  He wondered if she had ever existed.\n\n\"It looks more like Hope than her sister,\" he mused.  \"It looks very\nmuch like Hope.\"  He decided that he would let it remain where it was\nuntil Hope gave him a better one; and smiling slightly he snapped the\nlid fast, as though he were closing a door on the face of Alice Langham\nand locking it forever.\n\nKirkland was in the cab of the locomotive that brought the soldiers\nfrom the mine.  He stopped the first car in front of the freight\nstation until the workmen had filed out and formed into a double line\non the platform.  Then he moved the train forward the length of that\ncar, and those in the one following were mustered out in a similar\nmanner.  As the cars continued to come in, the men at the head of the\ndouble line passed on through the freight station and on up the road to\nthe city in an unbroken column. There was no confusion, no crowding,\nand no haste.\n\nWhen the last car had been emptied, Clay rode down the line and\nappointed a foreman to take charge of each company, stationing his\nengineers and the Irish-Americans in the van.  It looked more like a\nmob than a regiment.  None of the men were in uniform, and the native\nsoldiers were barefoot.  But they showed a winning spirit, and stood in\nas orderly an array as though they were drawn up in line to receive\ntheir month's wages.  The Americans in front of the column were\nhumorously disposed, and inclined to consider the whole affair as a\npleasant outing.  They had been placed in front, not because they were\nbetter shots than the natives, but because every South American thinks\nthat every citizen of the United States is a master either of the rifle\nor the revolver, and Clay was counting on this superstition.  His\nassistant engineers and foremen hailed him as he rode on up and down\nthe line with good-natured cheers, and asked him when they were to get\ntheir commissions, and if it were true that they were all captains, or\nonly colonels, as they were at home.\n\nThey had been waiting for a half-hour, when there was the sound of\nhorses' hoofs on the road, and the even beat of men's feet, and the\nadvance guard of the Third and Fourth regiments came toward them at a\nquickstep.  The men were still in the full-dress uniforms they had worn\nat the review the day before, and in comparison with the\nsoldier-workmen and the Americans in flannel shirts, they presented so\nmartial a showing that they were welcomed with tumultuous cheers.  Clay\nthrew them into a double line on one side of the road, down the length\nof which his own marched until they had reached the end of it nearest\nto the city, when they took up their position in a close formation, and\nthe native regiments fell in behind them.  Clay selected twenty of the\nbest shots from among the engineers and sent them on ahead as a\nskirmish line.  They were ordered to fall back at once if they saw any\nsign of the enemy.  In this order the column of four thousand men\nstarted for the city.\n\nIt was a little after seven when they advanced, and the air was mild\nand peaceful.  Men and women came crowding to the doors and windows of\nthe huts as they passed, and stood watching them in silence, not\nknowing to which party the small army might belong. In order to\nenlighten them, Clay shouted, \"Viva Rojas.\"  And his men took it up,\nand the people answered gladly.\n\nThey had reached the closely built portion of the city when the\nskirmish line came running back to say that it had been met by a\ndetachment of Mendoza's cavalry, who had galloped away as soon as they\nsaw them.  There was then no longer any doubt that the fact of their\ncoming was known at the Palace, and Clay halted his men in a bare plaza\nand divided them into three columns.  Three streets ran parallel with\none another from this plaza to the heart of the city, and opened\ndirectly upon the garden of the Palace where Mendoza had fortified\nhimself.  Clay directed the columns to advance up these streets,\nkeeping the head of each column in touch with the other two.  At the\nword they were to pour down the side streets and rally to each other's\nassistance.\n\nAs they stood, drawn up on the three sides of the plaza, he rode out\nbefore them and held up his hat for silence.  They were there with arms\nin their hands, he said, for two reasons: the greater one, and the one\nwhich he knew actuated the native soldiers, was their desire to\npreserve the Constitution of the Republic. According to their own laws,\nthe Vice-President must succeed when the President's term of office had\nexpired, or in the event of his death.  President Alvarez had been\nassassinated, and the Vice-President, General Rojas, was, in\nconsequence, his legal successor.  It was their duty, as soldiers of\nthe Republic, to rescue him from prison, to drive the man who had\nusurped his place into exile, and by so doing uphold the laws which\nthey had themselves laid down.  The second motive, he went on, was a\nless worthy and more selfish one.  The Olancho mines, which now gave\nwork to thousands and brought millions of dollars into the country,\nwere coveted by Mendoza, who would, if he could, convert them into a\nmonopoly of his government.  If he remained in power all foreigners\nwould be driven out of the country, and the soldiers would be forced to\nwork in the mines without payment. Their condition would be little\nbetter than that of the slaves in the salt mines of Siberia.  Not only\nwould they no longer be paid for their labor, but the people as a whole\nwould cease to receive that share of the earnings of the mines which\nhad hitherto been theirs.\n\n\"Under President Rojas you will have liberty, justice, and prosperity,\"\nClay cried.  \"Under Mendoza you will be ruled by martial law.  He will\nrob and overtax you, and you will live through a reign of terror.\nBetween them--which will you choose?\"\n\nThe native soldiers answered by cries of \"Rojas,\" and breaking ranks\nrushed across the plaza toward him, crowding around his horse and\nshouting, \"Long live Rojas,\" \"Long live the Constitution,\" \"Death to\nMendoza.\"  The Americans stood as they were and gave three cheers for\nthe Government.\n\nThey were still cheering and shouting as they advanced upon the Palace,\nand the noise of their coming drove the people indoors, so that they\nmarched through deserted streets and between closed doors and sightless\nwindows.  No one opposed them, and no one encouraged them.  But they\ncould now see the facade of the Palace and the flag of the\nRevolutionists hanging from the mast in front of it.\n\nThree blocks distant from the Palace they came upon the buildings of\nthe United States and English Legations, where the flags of the two\ncountries had been hung out over the narrow thoroughfare.\n\nThe windows and the roofs of each legation were crowded with women and\nchildren who had sought refuge there, and the column halted as Weimer,\nthe Consul, and Sir Julian Pindar, the English Minister, came out,\nbare-headed, into the street and beckoned to Clay to stop.\n\n\"As our Minister was not here,\" Weimer said, \"I telegraphed to Truxillo\nfor the man-of-war there.  She started some time ago, and we have just\nheard that she is entering the lower harbor. She should have her\nblue-jackets on shore in twenty minutes.  Sir Julian and I think you\nought to wait for them.\"\n\nThe English Minister put a detaining hand on Clay's bridle.  \"If you\nattack Mendoza at the Palace with this mob,\" he remonstrated, \"rioting\nand lawlessness generally will break out all over the city.  I ask you\nto keep them back until we get your sailors to police the streets and\nprotect property.\"\n\nClay glanced over his shoulder at the engineers and the Irish workmen\nstanding in solemn array behind him.  \"Oh, you can hardly call this a\nmob,\" he said.  \"They look a little rough and ready, but I will answer\nfor them.  The two other columns that are coming up the streets\nparallel to this are Government troops and properly engaged in driving\na usurper out of the Government building.  The best thing you can do is\nto get down to the wharf and send the marines and blue-jackets where\nyou think they will do the most good.  I can't wait for them.  And they\ncan't come too soon.\"\n\nThe grounds of the Palace occupied two entire blocks; the Botanical\nGardens were in the rear, and in front a series of low terraces ran\ndown from its veranda to the high iron fence which separated the\ngrounds from the chief thoroughfare of the city.\n\nClay sent word to the left and right wing of his little army to make a\ndetour one street distant from the Palace grounds and form in the\nstreet in the rear of the Botanical Gardens.  When they heard the\nfiring of his men from the front they were to force their way through\nthe gates at the back and attack the Palace in the rear.\n\n\"Mendoza has the place completely barricaded,\" Weimer warned him, \"and\nhe has three field pieces covering each of these streets.  You and your\nmen are directly in line of one of them now.  He is only waiting for\nyou to get a little nearer before he lets loose.\"\n\nFrom where he sat Clay could count the bars of the iron fence in front\nof the grounds.  But the boards that backed them prevented his forming\nany idea of the strength or the distribution of Mendoza's forces.  He\ndrew his staff of amateur officers to one side and explained the\nsituation to them.\n\n\"The Theatre National and the Club Union,\" he said, \"face the Palace\nfrom the opposite corners of this street.  You must get into them and\nbarricade the windows and throw up some sort of shelter for yourselves\nalong the edge of the roofs and drive the men behind that fence back to\nthe Palace.  Clear them away from the cannon first, and keep them away\nfrom it.  I will be waiting in the street below.  When you have driven\nthem back, we will charge the gates and have it out with them in the\ngardens.  The Third and Fourth regiments ought to take them in the rear\nabout the same time.  You will continue to pick them off from the roof.\"\n\nThe two supporting columns had already started on their roundabout way\nto the rear of the Palace.  Clay gathered up his reins, and telling his\nmen to keep close to the walls, started forward, his soldiers following\non the sidewalks and leaving the middle of the street clear.  As they\nreached a point a hundred yards below the Palace, a part of the wooden\nshield behind the fence was thrown down, there was a puff of white\nsmoke and a report, and a cannon-ball struck the roof of a house which\nthey were passing and sent the tiles clattering about their heads.  But\nthe men in the lead had already reached the stage-door of the theatre\nand were opposite one of the doors to the club.  They drove these in\nwith the butts of their rifles, and raced up the stairs of each of the\ndeserted buildings until they reached the roof.  Langham was swept by a\nweight of men across a stage, and jumped among the music racks in the\norchestra.  He caught a glimpse of the early morning sun shining on the\ntawdry hangings of the boxes and the exaggerated perspective of the\nscenery.  He ran through corridors between two great statues of Comedy\nand Tragedy, and up a marble stair case to a lobby in which he saw the\nwhite faces about him multiplied in long mirrors, and so out to an iron\nbalcony from which he looked down, panting and breathless, upon the\nPalace Gardens, swarming with soldiers and white with smoke.  Men\npoured through the windows of the club opposite, dragging sofas and\nchairs out to the balcony and upon the flat roof.  The men near him\nwere tearing down the yellow silk curtains in the lobby and draping\nthem along the railing of the balcony to better conceal their movements\nfrom the enemy below.  Bullets spattered the stucco about their heads,\nand panes of glass broke suddenly and fell in glittering particles upon\ntheir shoulders.  The firing had already begun from the roofs near\nthem.  Beyond the club and the theatre and far along the street on each\nside of the Palace the merchants were slamming the iron shutters of\ntheir shops, and men and women were running for refuge up the high\nsteps of the church of Santa Maria. Others were gathered in black\nmasses on the balconies and roofs of the more distant houses, where\nthey stood outlined against the soft blue sky in gigantic silhouette.\nTheir shouts of encouragement and anger carried clearly in the morning\nair, and spurred on the gladiators below to greater effort.  In the\nPalace Gardens a line of Mendoza's men fought from behind the first\nbarricade, while others dragged tables and bedding and chairs across\nthe green terraces and tumbled them down to those below, who seized\nthem and formed them into a second line of defence.\n\nTwo of the assistant engineers were kneeling at Langham's feet with the\nbarrels of their rifles resting on the railing of the balcony.  Their\neyes had been trained for years to judge distances and to measure\nspace, and they glanced along the sights of their rifles as though they\nwere looking through the lens of a transit, and at each report their\nfaces grew more earnest and their lips pressed tighter together.  One\nof them lowered his gun to light a cigarette, and Langham handed him\nhis match-box, with a certain feeling of repugnance.\n\n\"Better get under cover, Mr. Langham,\" the man said, kindly. \"There's\nno use our keeping your mines for you if you're not alive to enjoy\nthem.  Take a shot at that crew around the gun.\"\n\n\"I don't like this long range business,\" Langham answered.  \"I am going\ndown to join Clay.  I don't like the idea of hitting a man when he\nisn't looking at you.\"\n\nThe engineer gave an incredulous laugh.\n\n\"If he isn't looking at you, he's aiming at the man next to you. 'Live\nand let Live' doesn't apply at present.\"\n\nAs Langham reached Clay's side triumphant shouts arose from the\nroof-tops, and the men posted there stood up and showed themselves\nabove the barricades and called to Clay that the cannon were deserted.\n\nKirkland had come prepared for the barricade, and, running across the\nstreet, fastened a dynamite cartridge to each gate post and lit the\nfuses.  The soldiers scattered before him as he came leaping back, and\nin an instant later there was a racking roar, and the gates were\npitched out of their sockets and thrown forward, and those in the\nstreet swept across them and surrounded the cannon.\n\nLangham caught it by the throat as though it were human, and did not\nfeel the hot metal burning the palms of his hands as he choked it and\npointed its muzzle toward the Palace, while the others dragged at the\nspokes of the wheel.  It was fighting at close range now, close enough\nto suit even Langham.  He found himself in the front rank of it without\nknowing exactly how he got there.  Every man on both sides was playing\nhis own hand, and seemed to know exactly what to do.  He felt neglected\nand very much alone, and was somewhat anxious lest his valor might be\nwasted through his not knowing how to put it to account.  He saw the\nenemy in changing groups of scowling men, who seemed to eye him for an\ninstant down the length of a gun-barrel and then disappear behind a\npuff of smoke.  He kept thinking that war made men take strange\nliberties with their fellow-men, and it struck him as being most absurd\nthat strangers should stand up and try to kill one another, men who had\nso little in common that they did not even know one another's names.\nThe soldiers who were fighting on his own side were equally unknown to\nhim, and he looked in vain for Clay.  He saw MacWilliams for a moment\nthrough the smoke, jabbing at a jammed cartridge with his pen-knife,\nand hacking the lead away to make it slip.  He was remonstrating with\nthe gun and swearing at it exactly as though it were human, and as\nLangham ran toward him he threw it away and caught up another from the\nground.  Kneeling beside the wounded man who had dropped it and picking\nthe cartridges from his belt, he assured him cheerfully that he was not\nso badly hurt as he thought.\n\n\"You all right?\" Langham asked.\n\n\"I'm all right.  I'm trying to get a little laddie hiding behind that\nblue silk sofa over there.  He's taken an unnatural dislike to me, and\nhe's nearly got me three times.  I'm knocking horse-hair out of his\nrampart, though.\"\n\nThe men of Stuart's body-guard were fighting outside of the breastworks\nand mattresses.  They were using their swords as though they were\nmachetes, and the Irishmen were swinging their guns around their\nshoulders like sledge-hammers, and beating their foes over the head and\nbreast.  The guns at his own side sounded close at Langham's ear, and\ndeafened him, and those of the enemy exploded so near to his face that\nhe was kept continually winking and dodging, as though he were being\ntaken by a flashlight photograph.  When he fired he aimed where the\nmass was thickest, so that he might not see what his bullet did, but he\nremembered afterward that he always reloaded with the most anxious\nswiftness in order that he might not be killed before he had had\nanother shot, and that the idea of being killed was of no concern to\nhim except on that account.  Then the scene before him changed, and\napparently hundreds of Mendoza's soldiers poured out from the Palace\nand swept down upon him, cheering as they came, and he felt himself\nfalling back naturally and as a matter of course, as he would have\nstepped out of the way of a locomotive, or a runaway horse, or any\nother unreasoning thing.  His shoulders pushed against a mass of\nshouting, sweating men, who in turn pressed back upon others, until the\nmass reached the iron fence and could move no farther.  He heard Clay's\nvoice shouting to them, and saw him run forward, shooting rapidly as he\nran, and he followed him, even though his reason told him it was a\nuseless thing to do, and then there came a great shout from the rear of\nthe Palace, and more soldiers, dressed exactly like the others, rushed\nthrough the great doors and swarmed around the two wings of the\nbuilding, and he recognized them as Rojas's men and knew that the fight\nwas over.\n\nHe saw a tall man with a negro's face spring out of the first mass of\nsoldiers and shout to them to follow him.  Clay gave a yell of welcome\nand ran at him, calling upon him in Spanish to surrender.  The negro\nstopped and stood at bay, glaring at Clay and at the circle of soldiers\nclosing in around him.  He raised his revolver and pointed it steadily.\nIt was as though the man knew he had only a moment to live, and meant\nto do that one thing well in the short time left him.\n\nClay sprang to one side and ran toward him, dodging to the right and\nleft, but Mendoza followed his movements carefully with his revolver.\n\nIt lasted but an instant.  Then the Spaniard threw his arm suddenly\nacross his face, drove the heel of his boot into the turf, and spinning\nabout on it fell forward.\n\n\"If he was shot where his sash crosses his heart, I know the man who\ndid it,\" Langham heard a voice say at his elbow, and turning saw\nMacWilliams wetting his fingers at his lips and touching them gingerly\nto the heated barrel of his Winchester.\n\nThe death of Mendoza left his followers without a leader and without a\ncause.  They threw their muskets on the ground and held their hands\nabove their heads, shrieking for mercy.  Clay and his officers answered\nthem instantly by running from one group to another, knocking up the\nbarrels of the rifles and calling hoarsely to the men on the roofs to\ncease firing, and as they were obeyed the noise of the last few random\nshots was drowned in tumultuous cheering and shouts of exultation,\nthat, starting in the gardens, were caught up by those in the streets\nand passed on quickly as a line of flame along the swaying housetops.\n\nThe native officers sprang upon Clay and embraced him after their\nfashion, hailing him as the Liberator of Olancho, as the Preserver of\nthe Constitution, and their brother patriot.  Then one of them climbed\nto the top of a gilt and marble table and proclaimed him military\nPresident.\n\n\"You'll proclaim yourself an idiot, if you don't get down from there,\"\nClay said, laughing.  \"I thank you for permitting me to serve with you,\ngentlemen.  I shall have great pleasure in telling our President how\nwell you acquitted yourself in this row--battle, I mean.  And now I\nwould suggest that you store the prisoners' weapons in the Palace and\nput a guard over them, and then conduct the men themselves to the\nmilitary prison, where you can release General Rojas and escort him\nback to the city in a triumphal procession.  You'd like that, wouldn't\nyou?\"\n\nBut the natives protested that that honor was for him alone. Clay\ndeclined it, pleading that he must look after his wounded.\n\n\"I can hardly believe there are any dead,\" he said to Kirkland.\n\n\"For, if it takes two thousand bullets to kill a man in European\nwarfare, it must require about two hundred thousand to kill a man in\nSouth America.\"\n\nHe told Kirkland to march his men back to the mines and to see that\nthere were no stragglers.  \"If they want to celebrate, let them\ncelebrate when they get to the mines, but not here.  They have made a\ngood record to-day and I won't have it spoiled by rioting.  They shall\nhave their reward later.  Between Rojas and Mr. Langham they should all\nbe rich men.\"\n\nThe cheering from the housetops since the firing ceased had changed\nsuddenly into hand-clappings, and the cries, though still\nundistinguishable, were of a different sound.  Clay saw that the\nAmericans on the balconies of the club and of the theatre had thrown\nthemselves far over the railings and were all looking in the same\ndirection and waving their hats and cheering loudly, and he heard above\nthe shouts of the people the regular tramp of men's feet marching in\nstep, and the rattle of a machine gun as it bumped and shook over the\nrough stones.  He gave a shout of pleasure, and Kirkland and the two\nboys ran with him up the slope, crowding each other to get a better\nview.  The mob parted at the Palace gates, and they saw two lines of\nblue-jackets, spread out like the sticks of a fan, dragging the gun\nbetween them, the middies in their tight-buttoned tunics and gaiters,\nand behind them more blue-jackets with bare, bronzed throats, and with\nthe swagger and roll of the sea in their legs and shoulders.  An\nAmerican flag floated above the white helmets of the marines.  Its\npresence and the sense of pride which the sight of these men from home\nawoke in them made the fight just over seem mean and petty, and they\ntook off their hats and cheered with the others.\n\nA first lieutenant, who felt his importance and also a sense of\ndisappointment at having arrived too late to see the fighting, left his\nmen at the gate of the Palace, and advanced up the terrace, stopping to\nask for information as he came.  Each group to which he addressed\nhimself pointed to Clay.  The sight of his own flag had reminded Clay\nthat the banner of Mendoza still hung from the mast beside which he was\nstanding, and as the officer approached he was busily engaged in\nuntwisting its halyards and pulling it down.\n\nThe lieutenant saluted him doubtfully.\n\n\"Can you tell me who is in command here?\" he asked.  He spoke somewhat\nsharply, for Clay was not a military looking personage, covered as he\nwas with dust and perspiration, and with his sombrero on the back of\nhis head.\n\n\"Our Consul here told us at the landing-place,\" continued the\nlieutenant in an aggrieved tone, \"that a General Mendoza was in power,\nand that I had better report to him, and then ten minutes later I hear\nthat he is dead and that a General Rojas is President, but that a man\nnamed Clay has made himself Dictator. My instructions are to recognize\nno belligerents, but to report to the Government party.  Now, who is\nthe Government party?\"\n\nClay brought the red-barred flag down with a jerk, and ripped it free\nfrom the halyards.  Kirkland and the two boys were watching him with\namused smiles.\n\n\"I appreciate your difficulty,\" he said.  \"President Alvarez is dead,\nand General Mendoza, who tried to make himself Dictator, is also dead,\nand the real President, General Rojas, is still in jail.  So at present\nI suppose that I represent the Government party, at least I am the man\nnamed Clay.  It hadn't occurred to me before, but, until Rojas is free,\nI guess I am the Dictator of Olancho.  Is Madame Alvarez on board your\nship?\"\n\n\"Yes, she is with us,\" the officer replied, in some confusion. \"Excuse\nme--are you the three gentlemen who took her to the yacht?  I am afraid\nI spoke rather hastily just now, but you are not in uniform, and the\nGovernment seems to change so quickly down here that a stranger finds\nit hard to keep up with it.\"\n\nSix of the native officers had approached as the lieutenant was\nspeaking and saluted Clay gravely.  \"We have followed your\ninstructions,\" one of them said, \"and the regiments are ready to march\nwith the prisoners.  Have you any further orders for us--can we deliver\nany messages to General Rojas?\"\n\n\"Present my congratulations to General Rojas, and best wishes,\" said\nClay.  \"And tell him for me, that it would please me greatly if he\nwould liberate an American citizen named Burke, who is at present in\nthe cuartel.  And that I wish him to promote all of you gentlemen one\ngrade and give each of you the Star of Olancho.  Tell him that in my\nopinion you have deserved even higher reward and honor at his hands.\"\n\nThe boy-lieutenants broke out into a chorus of delighted thanks. They\nassured Clay that he was most gracious; that he overwhelmed them, and\nthat it was honor enough for them that they had served under him.  But\nClay laughed, and drove them off with a paternal wave of the hand.\n\nThe officer from the man-of-war listened with an uncomfortable sense of\nhaving blundered in his manner toward this powder-splashed young man\nwho set American citizens at liberty, and created captains by the\nhalf-dozen at a time.\n\n\"Are you from the States?\" he asked as they moved toward the\nman-of-war's men.\n\n\"I am, thank God.  Why not?\"\n\n\"I thought you were, but you saluted like an Englishman.\"\n\n\"I was an officer in the English army once in the Soudan, when they\nwere short of officers.\"  Clay shook his head and looked wistfully at\nthe ranks of the blue-jackets drawn up on either side of them.  The\nhorses had been brought out and Langham and MacWilliams were waiting\nfor him to mount.  \"I have worn several uniforms since I was a boy,\"\nsaid Clay.  \"But never that of my own country.\"\n\nThe people were cheering him from every part of the square. Women waved\ntheir hands from balconies and housetops, and men climbed to awnings\nand lampposts and shouted his name.  The officers and men of the\nlanding party took note of him and of this reception out of the corner\nof their eyes, and wondered.\n\n\"And what had I better do?\" asked the commanding officer.\n\n\"Oh, I would police the Palace grounds, if I were you, and picket that\nstreet at the right, where there are so many wine shops, and preserve\norder generally until Rojas gets here. He won't be more than an hour,\nnow.  We shall be coming over to pay our respects to your captain\nto-morrow.  Glad to have met you.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad to have met you,\" answered the officer, heartily.\n\"Hold on a minute.  Even if you haven't worn our uniform, you're as\ngood, and better, than some I've seen that have, and you're a sort of a\ncommander-in-chief, anyway, and I'm damned if I don't give you a sort\nof salute.\"\n\nClay laughed like a boy as he swung himself into the saddle.  The\nofficer stepped back and gave the command; the middies raised their\nswords and Clay passed between massed rows of his countrymen with their\nmuskets held rigidly toward him.  The housetops rocked again at the\nsight, and as he rode out into the brilliant sunshine, his eyes were\nwet and winking.\n\nThe two boys had drawn up at his side, but MacWilliams had turned in\nthe saddle and was still looking toward the Palace, with his hand\nresting on the hindquarters of his pony.\n\n\"Look back, Clay,\" he said.  \"Take a last look at it, you'll never see\nit after to-day.  Turn again, turn again, Dictator of Olancho.\"\n\nThe men laughed and drew rein as he bade them, and looked back up the\nnarrow street.  They saw the green and white flag of Olancho creeping\nto the top of the mast before the Palace, the blue-jackets driving back\nthe crowd, the gashes in the walls of the houses, where Mendoza's\ncannonballs had dug their way through the stucco, and the silk\ncurtains, riddled with bullets, flapping from the balconies of the\nopera-house.\n\n\"You had it all your own way an hour ago,\" MacWilliams said, mockingly.\n\"You could have sent Rojas into exile, and made us all Cabinet\nMinisters--and you gave it up for a girl.  Now, you're Dictator of\nOlancho.  What will you be to-morrow?  To-morrow you will be Andrew\nLangham's son-in-law--Benedict, the married man.  Andrew Langham's\nson-in-law cannot ask his wife to live in such a hole as this,\nso--Goodbye, Mr. Clay.  We have been long together.\"\n\nClay and Langham looked curiously at the boy to see if he were in\nearnest, but MacWilliams would not meet their eyes.\n\n\"There were three of us,\" he said, \"and one got shot, and one got\nmarried, and the third--?  You will grow fat, Clay, and live on Fifth\nAvenue and wear a high silk hat, and some day when you're sitting in\nyour club you'll read a paragraph in a newspaper with a queer Spanish\ndate-line to it, and this will all come back to you,--this heat, and\nthe palms, and the fever, and the days when you lived on plantains and\nwe watched our trestles grow out across the canons, and you'll be\nwilling to give your hand to sleep in a hammock again, and to feel the\nsweat running down your back, and you'll want to chuck your gun up\nagainst your chin and shoot into a line of men, and the policemen won't\nlet you, and your wife won't let you.  That's what you're giving up.\nThere it is.  Take a good look at it.  You'll never see it again.\"\n\n\n\nXV\n\nThe steamer \"Santiago,\" carrying \"passengers, bullion, and coffee,\" was\nheaded to pass Porto Rico by midnight, when she would be free of land\nuntil she anchored at the quarantine station of the green hills of\nStaten Island.  She had not yet shaken off the contamination of the\nearth; a soft inland breeze still tantalized her with odors of tree and\nsoil, the smell of the fresh coat of paint that had followed her\ncoaling rose from her sides, and the odor of spilt coffee-grains that\nhung around the hatches had yet to be blown away by a jealous ocean\nbreeze, or washed by a welcoming cross sea.\n\nThe captain stopped at the open entrance of the Social Hall. \"If any of\nyou ladies want to take your last look at Olancho you've got to come\nnow,\" he said.  \"We'll lose the Valencia light in the next quarter\nhour.\"\n\nMiss Langham and King looked up from their novels and smiled, and Miss\nLangham shook her head.  \"I've taken three final farewells of Olancho\nalready,\" she said: \"before we went down to dinner, and when the sun\nset, and when the moon rose.  I have no more sentiment left to draw on.\nDo you want to go?\" she asked.\n\n\"I'm very comfortable, thank you,\" King said, and returned to the\nconsideration of his novel.\n\nBut Clay and Hope arose at the captain's suggestion with suspicious\nalacrity, and stepped out upon the empty deck, and into the\nencompassing darkness, with a little sigh of relief.\n\nAlice Langham looked after them somewhat wistfully and bit the edges of\nher book.  She sat for some time with her brows knitted, glancing\noccasionally and critically toward King and up with unseeing eyes at\nthe swinging lamps of the saloon.  He caught her looking at him once\nwhen he raised his eyes as he turned a page, and smiled back at her,\nand she nodded pleasantly and bent her head over her reading.  She\nassured herself that after all King understood her and she him, and\nthat if they never rose to certain heights, they never sank below a\nhigh level of mutual esteem, and that perhaps was the best in the end.\n\nKing had placed his yacht at the disposal of Madame Alvarez, and she\nhad sailed to Colon, where she could change to the steamers for Lisbon,\nwhile he accompanied the Langhams and the wedding party to New York.\n\nClay recognized that the time had now arrived in his life when he could\ngraduate from the position of manager-director and become the\nengineering expert, and that his services in Olancho were no longer\nneeded.\n\nWith Rojas in power Mr. Langham had nothing further to fear from the\nGovernment, and with Kirkland in charge and young Langham returning\nafter a few months' absence to resume his work, he felt himself free to\nenjoy his holiday.\n\nThey had taken the first steamer out, and the combined efforts of all\nhad been necessary to prevail upon MacWilliams to accompany them; and\neven now the fact that he was to act as Clay's best man and, as Langham\nassured him cheerfully, was to wear a frock coat and see his name in\nall the papers, brought on such sudden panics of fear that the\nfast-fading coast line filled his soul with regret, and a wilful desire\nto jump overboard and swim back.\n\nClay and Hope stopped at the door of the chief engineer's cabin and\nsaid they had come to pay him a visit.  The chief had but just come\nfrom the depths where the contamination of the earth was most evident\nin the condition of his stokers; but his chin was now cleanly shaven,\nand his pipe was drawing as well as his engine fires, and he had\nwrapped himself in an old P. & O. white duck jacket to show what he had\nbeen before he sank to the level of a coasting steamer.  They admired\nthe clerk-like neatness of the report he had just finished, and in\nreturn he promised them the fastest run on record, and showed them the\nportrait of his wife, and of their tiny cottage on the Isle of Wight,\nand his jade idols from Corea, and carved cocoanut gourds from Brazil,\nand a picture from the \"Graphic\" of Lord Salisbury, tacked to the\npartition and looking delightedly down between two highly colored\nlithographs of Miss Ellen Terry and the Princess May.\n\nThen they called upon the captain, and Clay asked him why captains\nalways hung so much lace about their beds when they invariably slept on\na red velvet sofa with their boots on, and the captain ordered his\nChinese steward to mix them a queer drink and offered them the choice\nof a six months' accumulation of paper novels, and free admittance to\nhis bridge at all hours. And then they passed on to the door of the\nsmoking-room and beckoned MacWilliams to come out and join them.  His\nmanner as he did so bristled with importance, and he drew them eagerly\nto the rail.\n\n\"I've just been having a chat with Captain Burke,\" he said, in an\nundertone.  \"He's been telling Langham and me about a new game that's\nbetter than running railroads.  He says there's a country called\nMacedonia that's got a native prince who wants to be free from Turkey,\nand the Turks won't let him, and Burke says if we'll each put up a\nthousand dollars, he'll guarantee to get the prince free in six months.\nHe's made an estimate of the cost and submitted it to the Russian\nEmbassy at Washington, and he says they will help him secretly, and he\nknows a man who has just patented a new rifle, and who will supply him\nwith a thousand of them for the sake of the advertisement.  He says\nit's a mountainous country, and all you have to do is to stand on the\npasses and roll rocks down on the Turks as they come in.  It sounds\neasy, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Then you're thinking of turning professional filibuster yourself?\"\nsaid Clay.\n\n\"Well, I don't know.  It sounds more interesting than engineering.\nBurke says I beat him on his last fight, and he'd like to have me with\nhim in the next one--sort of young-blood-in-the-firm idea--and he\ncalculates that we can go about setting people free and upsetting\ngovernments for some time to come.  He says there is always something\nto fight about if you look for it. And I must say the condition of\nthose poor Macedonians does appeal to me.  Think of them all alone down\nthere bullied by that Sultan of Turkey, and wanting to be free and\nindependent.  That's not right.  You, as an American citizen, ought to\nbe the last person in the world to throw cold water on an undertaking\nlike that.  In the name of Liberty now?\"\n\n\"I don't object; set them free, of course,\" laughed Clay. \"But how long\nhave you entertained this feeling for the enslaved Macedonians, Mac?\"\n\n\"Well, I never heard of them until a quarter of an hour ago, but they\noughtn't to suffer through my ignorance.\"\n\n\"Certainly not.  Let me know when you're going to do it, and Hope and I\nwill run over and look on.  I should like to see you and Burke and the\nPrince of Macedonia rolling rocks down on the Turkish Empire.\"\n\nHope and Clay passed on up the deck laughing, and MacWilliams looked\nafter them with a fond and paternal smile.  The lamp in the wheelhouse\nthrew a broad belt of light across the forward deck as they passed\nthrough it into the darkness of the bow, where the lonely lookout\nturned and stared at them suspiciously, and then resumed his stern\nwatch over the great waters.\n\nThey leaned upon the rail and breathed the soft air which the rush of\nthe steamer threw in their faces, and studied in silence the stars that\nlay so low upon the horizon line that they looked like the harbor\nlights of a great city.\n\n\"Do you see that long line of lamps off our port bow?\" asked Clay.\n\nHope nodded.\n\n\"Those are the electric lights along the ocean drive at Long Branch and\nup the Rumson Road, and those two stars a little higher up are fixed to\nthe mast-heads of the Scotland Lightship. And that mass of light that\nyou think is the Milky Way, is the glare of the New York street lamps\nthrown up against the sky.\"\n\n\"Are we so near as that?\" said Hope, smiling.  \"And what lies over\nthere?\" she asked, pointing to the east.\n\n\"Over there is the coast of Africa.  Don't you see the lighthouse on\nCape Bon?  If it wasn't for Gibraltar being in the way, I could show\nyou the harbor lights of Bizerta, and the terraces of Algiers shining\nlike a café chantant in the night.\"\n\n\"Algiers,\" sighed Hope, \"where you were a soldier of Africa, and rode\nacross the deserts.  Will you take me there?\"\n\n\"There, of course, but to Gibraltar first, where we will drive along\nthe Alameda by moonlight.  I drove there once coming home from a mess\ndinner with the Colonel.  The drive lies between broad white\nbalustrades, and the moon shone down on us between the leaves of the\nSpanish bayonet.  It was like an Italian garden.  But he did not see\nit, and he would talk to me about the Watkins range finder on the lower\nramparts, and he puffed on a huge cigar.  I tried to imagine I was\nthere on my honeymoon, but the end of his cigar would light up and I\nwould see his white mustache and the glow on his red jacket, so I vowed\nI would go over that drive again with the proper person.  And we won't\ntalk of range finders, will we?\n\n\"There to the North is Paris; your Paris, and my Paris, with London\nonly eight hours away.  If you look very closely, you can see the\nthousands of hansom cab lamps flashing across the asphalt, and the open\ntheatres, and the fairy lamps in the gardens back of the houses in\nMayfair, where they are giving dances in your honor, in honor of the\nbeautiful American bride, whom every one wants to meet.  And you will\nwear the finest tiara we can get on Bond Street, but no one will look\nat it; they will only look at you.  And I will feel very miserable and\ntease you to come home.\"\n\nHope put her hand in his, and he held her finger-tips to his lips for\nan instant and closed his other hand upon hers.\n\n\"And after that?\" asked Hope.\n\n\"After that we will go to work again, and take long journeys to Mexico\nand Peru or wherever they want me, and I will sit in judgment on the\nwork other chaps have done.  And when we get back to our car at night,\nor to the section house, for it will be very rough sometimes,\"--Hope\npressed his hand gently in answer,--\"I will tell you privately how very\ndifferently your husband would have done it, and you, knowing all about\nit, will say that had it been left to me, I would certainly have\naccomplished it in a vastly superior manner.\"\n\n\"Well, so you would,\" said Hope, calmly.\n\n\"That's what I said you'd say,\" laughed Clay.  \"Dearest,\" he begged,\n\"promise me something.  Promise me that you are going to be very happy.\"\n\nHope raised her eyes and looked up at him in silence, and had the man\nin the wheelhouse been watching the stars, as he should have been, no\none but the two foolish young people on the bow of the boat would have\nknown her answer.\n\nThe ship's bell sounded eight times, and Hope moved slightly.\n\n\"So late as that,\" she sighed.  \"Come.  We must be going back.\"\n\nA great wave struck the ship's side a friendly slap, and the wind\ncaught up the spray and tossed it in their eyes, and blew a strand of\nher hair loose so that it fell across Clay's face, and they laughed\nhappily together as she drew it back and he took her hand again to\nsteady her progress across the slanting deck.\n\nAs they passed hand in hand out of the shadow into the light from the\nwheelhouse, the lookout in the bow counted the strokes of the bell to\nhimself, and then turned and shouted back his measured cry to the\nbridge above them.  His voice seemed to be a part of the murmuring sea\nand the welcoming winds.\n\n\"Listen,\" said Clay.\n\n\"Eight bells,\" the voice sang from the darkness.  \"The for'ard light's\nshining bright--and all's well.\"",
