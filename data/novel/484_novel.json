The\nauthor, very grateful for the genial welcome extended to these young\ngentlemen, begs leave to introduce to his juvenile friends a smart\ngirl,--Miss Katy Redburn,--whose fortunes, he hopes, will prove\nsufficiently interesting to secure their attention.\n\nIf any of my adult readers are disposed to accuse me of being a little\nextravagant, I fear I shall have to let the case go by default; but I\nshall plead, in extenuation, that I have tried to be reasonable, even\nwhere a few grains of the romantic element were introduced; for Baron\nMunchausen and Sindbad the Sailor were standard works on my shelf in\nboyhood, and I may possibly have imbibed some of their peculiar spirit.\nBut I feel a lively satisfaction in the reflection that, whatever\nexaggerations the critic may decide I have perpetrated in this volume,\nI have made the success of Katy Redburn depend upon her good\nprinciples, her politeness, her determined perseverance, and her\novercoming that foolish pride which is a snare to the feet. In these\nrespects she is a worthy exemplar for the young.\n\nPride and poverty do not seem to agree with each other; but there is a\npride which is not irreconcilable with the humblest station. This pride\nof character finds an illustration in the life of my heroine.\n\nThanking my young friends again for the pleasant reception given to my\nformer books I submit this volume in the hope that Katy Redburn will\nprove to be a worthy and agreeable companion for their leisure hours.\n\nWILLIAM T.

Once is enough.\"\n\nTommy coolly hauled up a large flounder at that moment, and threw the\nfish into his basket. It was rather refreshing to see how regardless he\nwas of that pair of menacing fists.\n\n\"Jest you say that once more, and see what I'll do,\" persisted Johnny.\n\n\"I won't do it.\"\n\n\"You dasn't say it again.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I dasn't; at any rate, I shan't.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say I hooked them fish?\" exclaimed Johnny, desperately,\nfor it seemed as though he must do something to vindicate his injured\nhonor.\n\n\"That's just what I did say.\"\n\nBut Tommy was so confoundedly cool that his fellow-angler had some\ndoubts about the expediency of \"pitching into him.\" Probably a vision\nof defeat flashed through his excited brain and discretion seemed the\nbetter part of valor. Yet he was not disposed to abandon his position,\nand advanced a pace or two toward his provoking companion; a movement\nwhich, to an unpracticed eye, would indicate a purpose to do something.\n\n\"Don't fight, Tommy,\" said the little ragged girl.\n\n\"I don't mean to fight, Katy,\"--Johnny, at these words, assumed an\nartistic attitude, ready to strike the first blow,--\"only if Johnny\nhits me, I shall knock him into the middle of next week.\"\n\nJohnny did not strike. He was a prudent young man.\n\n\"Don't fight, Johnny,\" repeated the girl, turning to the excited\naspirant for the honors of the ring.\n\n\"Do you suppose I'll let him tell me I hooked them fish?\" blustered\nJohnny.\n\n\"He didn't mean anything.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did,\" interposed Tommy. \"He caught 'em on a hook; so of course\nhe hooked em. I hooked mine too.\"\n\n\"Is that what you meant?\" asked Johnny, a broad grin overspreading his\ndirty face, and his fists suddenly expanding into dirty paws again.\n\n\"That's just what I meant; and your skull is as thick as a two-inch\nplank, or you would have seen what I meant.\"\n\n\"I see now.\"\n\nJohnny was not disposed to resent this last insinuation about the\nsolidity of his cranium. He was evidently too glad to get out of the\nscrape without a broken head or a bloody nose. Johnny was a bully, and\nhe had a bully's reputation to maintain; but he never fought when the\nodds were against him; and he had a congressman's skill in backing out\nbefore the water got too hot. On the whole, he rather enjoyed the pun;\nand he had the condescension to laugh heartily, though somewhat\nunnaturally, at the jest.\n\n\"Will you give me a flounder, Tommy?\" said the little ragged girl, as\nshe glanced into his well-filled basket.\n\n\"What do you want of him, Katy?\" asked Tommy turning round and gazing\nup into her sad, pale face.\n\nKaty hesitated; her bosom heaved, and her lips compressed, as though\nshe feared to answer the question.\n\n\"To eat,\" she replied, at last, in a husky tone.\n\n\"What's the matter, Katy?\"\n\nThe face of the child seemed to wear a load of care and anxiety, and as\nthe young fisherman gazed a tear started from her eye, and slid down\nher cheek. Tommy's heart melted as he saw this exhibition of sorrow. He\nwondered what could ail her.\n\n\"My mother is sick,\" replied Katy, dashing away the tell-tale tear.\n\n\"I know that; but what do you want of flounders?\"\n\n\"We have nothing to eat now,\" said Katy, bursting into tears. \"Mother\nhas not been able to do any work for more than three months: and we\nhaven't got any money now. It's all gone. I haven't had any breakfast\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Take 'em all, Katy!\" exclaimed Tommy, jumping up from his seat on the\ncapsill of the pier. \"How will you carry them? Here, I will string 'em\nfor you.\"\n\nTommy was all energy now, and thrust his hands down into the depths of\nhis pockets in search of a piece of twine. Those repositories of small\nstores did not contain a string, however; but mixed up with a piece of\ncord, a slate pencil, an iron hinge, two marbles, a brass ring, and six\ninches of stovepipe chain, were two cents, which the owner thereof\ncarefully picked out of the heap of miscellaneous articles and thrust\nthem into the hand of Katy.\n\n\"Here, take them; and as you go by the grocery at the corner of the\ncourt, buy a two-cent roll,\" whispered he. \"Got a bit o' string,\nJohnny?\" he added aloud, as Katy began to protest against taking the\nmoney.\n\n\"Hain't got none; but I'll give you a piece of my fish line, if you\nwant,\" replied the bully, who was now unusually obliging.\n\n\"There's a piece of spunyarn, that's just the thing I want;\" and Tommy\nran half way up the pier to the bridge, picked up the line, and\ncommenced stringing the flounders on it.\n\n\"I don't want them all, Tommy; only give me two or three. I never shall\nforget you, Tommy,\" said Katy, her eyes suffused with tears of\ngratitude.\n\n\"I'm sorry things go so bad with you, Katy, and I wish I could do\nsomething more for you.\"\n\n\"I don't want anything more. Don't put any more on the string. There's\nsix. We can't eat any more.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I'll bring you some more to-morrow,\" replied Tommy, as he\nhanded her the string of fish. \"Stop a minute; here's a first-rate\ntom-cod; let me put him on;\" and he took the string and added the fish\nto his gift.\n\n\"I never shall forget you, Tommy; I shall only borrow the two cents; I\nwill pay you again some time,\" said she, in a low tone, so that Johnny\ncould not hear her.\n\n\"Never mind 'em, Katy. Don't go hungry again for a minute. Come to me,\nand I'll help you to something or other.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Tommy;\" and with a lighter heart than she had brought with\nher, she hastened up the pier, no doubt anticipating a rich feast from\nthe string of fish.\n\nThe pier of the new South Boston bridge was then, as now, a favorite\nresort for juvenile fishermen. Flounders, tom-cod, and eels, to say\nnothing of an occasional sculpin, which boys still persist in calling\n\"crahpies,\" or \"crahooners,\" used to furnish abundant sport to a motley\ngroup of youngsters wherein the sons of merchants mingled\ndemocratically with the dirty, ragged children of the \"Ten-footers\" in\nthe vicinity. The pier was neutral ground, and Frederic Augustus made a\nfriend of Michael or Dennis, and probably neither was much damaged by\nthis free companionship; for Michael or Dennis often proves to be more\nof a gentleman in his rags and dirty face than Frederic Augustus in his\nbroadcloth and white linen.\n\nKaty walked as fast as her little feet would carry her, till she came\nto a court leading out of Essex Street. The bells were ringing for one\no'clock as she entered the grocery at the corner and purchased the\ntwo-cent roll which Tommy Howard's bounty enabled her to add to her\nfeast. Elated with the success of her mission, she quickened her pace\nup the court to a run, rushed into the house and up-stairs to her\nmother's room with as much enthusiasm as though she had found a bag of\ngold, instead of having obtained a very simple dinner.\n\n\"O, mother, I've got a lot of flounders and some bread for you!\"\nexclaimed she, as she bolted into the room.\n\n\"Then you have money,\" said a cold voice in the chamber; and Katy\nperceived, standing near the bed on which her mother lay, a man who was\nno stranger to her.\n\nIt was Dr. Flynch; but let not my young reader make a mistake. He was\nno good Samaritan, who had come to pour oil and wine into the wounds of\nthe poor sick woman; not even a physician, who had come to give\nmedicine for a fee, to restore her to health and strength. It is true\nhe was called a doctor, and he had been a doctor, but he did not\npractice the healing art now. If he had failed to make a physician, it\nwas not because his heart was so tender that he could not bear to look\nupon pain and suffering. He was the agent of Mrs. Gordon, a widow lady,\nwho owned the house in which Katy's mother lived. He collected her\nrents, and transacted all her business; and as far as dollars and cents\nwere concerned, he had certainly been a faithful servant. Dr. Flynch\nwas a prudent and discreet man, and did not hurt the feelings of the\ngood lady who employed him by telling her about the difficulties he\nencountered in the discharge of his duty, or by describing the harsh\nand even cruel means to which he was sometimes obliged to resort, in\norder to obtain the rent of poor tenants.\n\n\"Mrs. Redburn,\" said Dr. Flynch, when he had heard the exclamation of\nKaty, \"you have told me a falsehood. You said you had no money, not a\ncent. Where did you get that roll, child?\"\n\n\"At the store at the corner of the court,\" replied Katy, abashed by the\ncold dignity of the agent.\n\n\"Precisely so, Mrs. Redburn; but you do not buy bread without money.\nYou have attempted to deceive me. I have pitied you up to the present\ntime, and indulged you in the non-payment of your rent for over a week\nI can do so no longer, for you have told me a falsehood.\"\n\n\"No, sir, I have not,\" pleaded the sick woman.\n\n\"Your child buys bread.\"\n\n\"I did not give her the money.\"\n\n\"Where did you get the money to buy that roll with?\" demanded Dr.\nFlynch, turning sharply to Katy.\n\n\"Tommy Howard gave it to me.\"\n\n\"Who is Tommy Howard?\"\n\n\"He lives on the other side of the court.\"\n\n\"Very probable that a dirty, ragged boy gave her the money! This is\nanother false-hood, Mrs. Redburn. I lament that a person in your\nsituation should have no higher views of Christian morality than to lie\nyourself, and teach your child to lie, which is much worse.\"\n\nThe poor woman burst into tears, and protested that she had told the\ntruth, and nothing but the truth; declaring that Katy was a good girl,\nthat she had eaten nothing that day, and would not tell a lie. Dr.\nFlynch was a man of method, and when a tenant did not pay the rent, it\nwas his purpose to get rid of that tenant in the quietest way possible.\nIn the present case there was a difficulty, and public opinion would\nnot justify him in turning a sick woman out of the house; but if she\nlied, had money concealed, and would not pay her rent, it would alter\nthe matter. As he wished to believe this was the case, he had no\ndifficulty in convincing himself, and thus quieting his poor apology\nfor a conscience.\n\nBesides being a man of method, Dr. Flynch was a man of upright walk and\nconversation; at least, he passed for such with those who did not know\nanything about him. If Mrs. Gordon should happen to hear that he had\nturned out the sick woman, he could then inform her how feelingly he\nhad pointed out to her the wickedness of her conduct, which he thought\nwould sound exceedingly well.\n\n\"Mrs. Redburn,\" he continued, \"I will give you till this time to-morrow\nto get out of the house; if you are not gone then, I shall be under the\npainful necessity of removing your goods into the street. Good\nmorning;\" and Dr. Flynch turned upon his heel, and walked out of the\nroom.\n\n\"My poor child! what will become of us?\" sobbed the sick woman, as she\ngrasped Katy's hand, and pressed it to her bosom with convulsive energy.\n\n\"Don't cry, mother; something can be done. I will go and see Mrs.\nGordon, and beg her to let you stay here.\"\n\n\"You must not do that; Dr. Flynch told me, if I troubled her about the\nhouse, I should not stay in it another minute, even if I paid the rent.\"\n\n\"He is a bad man, mother; and I don't believe Mrs. Gordon knows what he\ndoes here.\"\n\n\"There is one thing more we can do, Katy,\" continued Mrs. Redburn,\nwiping away her tears, and taking from under her pillow a heavy silver\nwatch. \"This was your father's; but we must sell it now. It is all we\nhave left.\"\n\n\"I should hate to have that sold, mother.\"\n\n\"We must sell it, or pawn it.\"\n\n\"We will pawn it then.\"\n\n\"How shall we do it? I have not strength to rise, and they will cheat\nyou if you offer it.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what I can do, mother; I will get Simon Sneed to go\nwith me to the pawnbroker's shop. He is very kind to me, and I know he\nwill. He comes home to dinner at two o-clock.\"\n\nThis plan was agreed to, and Katy then went to work to clean and cook\nthe flounders.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE HISTORY OF THE SILVER WATCH.\n\nKaty Redburn was only eleven years old, and not a very accomplished\ncook; but as the children learn faster in the homes of the poor than in\nthe dwellings of the rich, she had a very tolerable idea of the\nmanagement of a frying-pan. The operation of cleaning the flounders was\nthe greatest trial, for the skin of the fish has to be removed. She cut\nher fingers with the knife, and scratched and pricked her hands with\nthe sharp bones; but she was resolute, and finally accomplished the\ntask to her entire satisfaction. An occasional direction from her\nmother enabled her to cook the fish properly, and dinner was ready.\nThere were still a few small stores left in the closet, and Katy made a\ncup of tea for her mother, and with it placed the delicate little\nflounder by the side of the bed. The invalid had no appetite, but to\nplease Katy she ate a portion of the fish and bread though it was very\nhard work for her to do so. The little girl, gladdened by this unwonted\nsight, made a hearty meal, without a thought of the trials and sorrows\nwhich the future might have in store for them.\n\nWhen she had put away the dishes, and placed everything in order, she\nwashed herself, combed her hair, sewed up a great rent in her dress,\nand otherwise attempted to make herself as tidy as possible for the\nmission she was about to undertake.\n\n\"It is not time for you to go yet, Katy; and before the watch is\ncarried off, I want to tell you something about your father, that you\nmay learn to prize it as I do.\"\n\nKaty seated herself on the side of the bed, for she was very anxious to\nhear more about her father than she already knew. She had often asked\nher mother about him, but she had generally evaded her questions, and\ndid not seem willing to tell her all she knew. She thought there was\nsome secret connected with his history, and with a child's curiosity\nshe was eager to have the mystery unfolded. But it was no great secret,\nafter all only a painful history, which her sensitive mother did not\nlike to rehearse. Mrs. Redburn handed the watch to Katy, and asked her\nto look upon the back of it.\n\n\"Yes, mother, I have often seen those words on there--'All for the\nBest.' What do they mean?\" said Katy.\n\n\"This watch was given to your father by my father,\" replied Mrs.\nRedburn, with a deep sigh, for the words seemed to recall happy\nmemories of the past.\n\n\"Who was your father?\" asked the attentive little girl.\n\n\"His name was Matthew Guthrie. He was a merchant in Liverpool, England,\nwhere I was born.\"\n\n\"A merchant, mother? Then he was a rich man, and lived in a great\nhouse, and had plenty of servants.\"\n\n\"He was rich, and lived in good style. One day there came a young man\nin great distress to his counting-room. He was a clerk, and had been\nsent by his employer in Manchester to pay a large sum of money to my\nfather. After leaving the train, he had entered an ale-house, where he\nhad been robbed of the remittance. He had been imprudent, but instead\nof running away, he went directly to my father, and informed him of his\nmisfortune. The young man felt that he was ruined, but he said he was\ndetermined not to leave Liverpool till he had found the money. He was\nsure he knew the man who had robbed him, and my father procured the\nservices of several policemen to assist him in his search. All that day\nand all that night, attended by policemen, he visited the resorts of\nvice and crime, and his perseverance was rewarded with success. He\nfound the man, and the money was recovered. My father was so well\npleased with the energy of the young man, that he gave him a situation\nin his counting room. That young man was John Redburn, your father. My\nfather gave him a much larger salary than he had been receiving before,\nso that his misfortune in losing the money proved to be a piece of good\nfortune to him, for it procured him a much better situation. The new\nclerk performed his duties very faithfully, and at the end of a year my\nfather presented him this watch, with the motto, 'All for the Best,' in\nallusion to the manner in which he had obtained his situation.\"\n\n\"But how came you here, mother, if your father was rich, and lived in a\nfine house? You are very poor now;\" asked Katy, who feared that the\nmystery was yet to come.\n\nMrs. Redburn burst into tears, and covered her face with her hands, as\nthe pleasant memories of her former happy home rushed through her mind.\n\n\"Don't cry, mother; I won't ask you any more questions,\" said Katy,\ngrieved to find she had reminded her mother of some unpleasant thing.\n\n\"It was all my own fault, Katy. I am here poor and wretched, because I\ndisobeyed my father; because I did what he desired me not to do. I will\ntell you all about it, Katy. I became acquainted with the new clerk,\nJohn Redburn, and the result of our acquaintance was, that we were\nmarried in about a year. We ran away from home; for my father, however\nmuch he liked John as a clerk, was not willing that he should be my\nhusband. He forbade John's coming to our house, and forbade my seeing\nhim. I disobeyed him. We were married, and John was discharged. My\nfather refused to see me again.\"\n\n\"That was cruel,\" interposed Katy\n\n\"My father was right, and I have always regretted that I disobeyed him.\nWe came to America, and your father procured a situation in New York,\nwhere you were born, about a year after we arrived. For three years we\ngot along very well. I wish I could stop here, Katy, for the rest of\nthe story is very sad.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me any more, mother, it makes you feel so bad, I would\nrather not hear it. I know now why you value the watch so much, and I\nhope we shall be able to get it back again.\"\n\n\"I fear not. But you must hear the rest of this sad story.\"\n\nMrs. Redburn continued the narrative, though tears blinded her eyes,\nand sobs chocked her utterance, as she told of the struggle she had had\nwith poverty and want. Her husband had done very well in New York; and,\ngay and light-hearted in the midst of his prosperity, his habits had\nbeen gradually growing worse and worse, till he lost his situation, and\nbecame a common sot. The poor wife had then been compelled to toil for\nher own support and that of her child; and having been brought up in\nluxury and ease, it was a dreadful task to her.\n\nJohn obtained another situation, but soon lost it. He was a\ngood-hearted man when he had not been drinking, and keenly felt the\ndisgrace and misery he was heaping upon himself and his unhappy wife.\nOnce he had the resolution to abandon the cup, fully determined to\nredeem his lost character, and make his family happy again. The better\nto accomplish this, he removed to Boston, where he obtained a good\nsituation, and for more than a year he adhered to his resolution. Mrs.\nRedburn was happy again and tremblingly hoped that the clouds of\ndarkness had forever passed away.\n\nThe evil time came again, and John Redburn sank down lower than ever\nbefore. His wife lost all hope of him, and struggled, with the courage\nof a hero and the fortitude of a martyr, against the adverse tide that\nset against her. She was fortunate in obtaining plenty of sewing, and\nwas able to support herself and child very well; but her husband, now\nlost to all sense of decency, contrived to obtain, from time to time, a\nportion of her hard earnings. She could never have believed that John\nRedburn would come to this; for, as a clerk in her father's counting\nroom, he had been all that was good and noble; but there he was a\nmiserable sot, lost to himself, to his family, and the world.\n\nOne morning in winter he was brought home to her dead. He had died in\nthe watch-house of delirium tremens. He was buried, and peace, if not\nhope, settled on the brow of the broken-hearted wife.\n\nYear after year Mrs. Redburn struggled on, often with feeble hands and\nfainting heart, to earn a subsistence for herself and Katy. She had\nbeen bred in opulence, and her wants were not so few and simple as the\nwants of those who have never enjoyed the luxury of a soft couch and a\nwell-supplied table. She had never learned that calculating economy\nwhich provides a great deal with very small means.\n\nHence it was much harder for her to support herself and child, than it\nwould have been for one who had been brought up in a hovel.\n\nShe had done very well, however, until, a few months before our story\nopens, she had been taken sick, and was no longer able to work. Her\ndisease was an affection of the spine, which was at times very painful,\nand confined her to the bed.\n\n\"But where is your father now?\" asked Katy, when her mother had\nfinished the narrative.\n\n\"I do not know; if he is alive, he probably lives in Liverpool.\"\n\n\"Why don't you write a letter to him?\"\n\n\"I have done so several times, but have never received any reply. I\nwrote shortly after your father died, giving an account of my\nsituation. I am sure my father never could have got my letter, or he\nwould have answered me. I know he would not let me suffer here in woe\nand want, if he were aware of my condition.\"\n\n\"Why don't you write again?\"\n\n\"It is useless.\"\n\n\"Let me write, mother. I will call him dear grandfather, and I am sure\nhe will send you some money then: perhaps he will send for us to go to\nLiverpool, and live in his great house, and have servants to wait upon\nus.\"\n\n\"Alas, my child, I have given up all hope of ever seeing him again in\nthis world. In my letters I confessed my fault, and begged his\nforgiveness. He cannot be alive, or I am sure my last letters would\nhave melted his heart.\"\n\n\"Haven't you any brothers and sisters, mother?\"\n\n\"I had one sister; and I have written several letters to her, but with\nno better success. They may be all dead. I fear they are.\"\n\n\"And your mother?\"\n\n\"She died when I was young. I know Jane would have answered my letters\nif she had received them.\"\n\n\"She was your sister?\"\n\n\"Yes; she must be dead; and I suppose my father's property must be in\nthe hands of strangers, covering their floors with soft carpets, and\ntheir tables with nice food, while I lie here in misery, and my poor\nchild actually suffers from hunger;\" and the afflicted mother clasped\nher daughter in her arms, and wept as though her heart would burst.\n\n\"Don't cry, mother. I was not very hungry. We have had enough to eat\ntill to-day. I am going to take care of you now, you have taken care of\nme so long,\" replied Katy, as she wiped away the tears that flowed down\nher mother's wan cheek.\n\n\"What can you do, poor child?\"\n\n\"I can do a great many things; I am sure I can earn money enough to\nsupport us both.\"\n\n\"It is hard to think how much I have suffered, and how much of woe\nthere may be in the future for me,\" sobbed Mrs. Redburn.\n\n\"Don't cry, mother. You know what it says on the watch--'All for the\nBest.' Who knows but that all your sorrows are for the best?\"\n\n\"I hope they are; I will try to think they are. But it is time for you\nto go. Pawn the watch for as much as you can; and I trust that some\nfortunate event will enable us to redeem it.\"\n\nKaty took the watch, smoothed down her hair again, put on her worn-out\nbonnet, and left the house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nKATY AND MASTER SIMON SNEED VISIT THE PAWNBROKER'S SHOP.\n\nThe court in which Katy lived had once been the abode of many very\nrespectable families, to use a popular word, for respectable does not\nalways mean worthy of respect on account of one's virtues, but worthy\nof respect on account of one's lands, houses, and money. In the former\nsense it was still occupied by very respectable families, though none\nof them possessed much of the \"goods that perish in the using\" Mrs.\nRedburn, the seamstress, was very respectable; Mrs. Colvin, the\nwasher-woman, was very respectable, so were Mrs. Howard, the tailoress,\nMr. Brown, the lumper, and Mr. Sneed, the mason.\n\nKaty's mother lived in a small house, with three other families. She\noccupied two rooms, for which she paid four dollars a month, the amount\nof rent now due and unpaid. Dr. Flynch took a great deal of pleasure in\ntelling Mrs. Redburn how his humanity and his regard for the welfare of\nthe poor had induced him to fix the rent at so cheap a rate; but he\nalways finished by assuring her that this sum must be promptly paid,\nand that no excuses could ever have any weight.\n\nThe next house to Mrs. Redburn was tenanted by Mr. Sneed, the mason. I\ndon't know whether I ought to say that Mr. Sneed had a son, or that\nMaster Simon Sneed had a father, being at a loss to determine which was\nthe more important personage of the two; but I am not going to say\nanything against either of them, for the father was a very honest mason\nand the son was a very nice young man.\n\nKaty knocked at the door of this house, and inquired for Master Simon\nSneed. She was informed that he had not yet finished his dinner; and\nshe decided to wait in the court till he made his appearance. Seating\nherself on the door stone, she permitted her mind to wander back to the\nnarrative her mother had related to her. She glanced at her coarse\nclothes, and could hardly believe that her grandfather was a rich\nmerchant, and lived in a fine house. How nice it would be if she could\nonly find the old gentleman! He could not be cross to her; he would\ngive her all the money she could spend, and make a great lady of her.\n\n\"Pooh! what a fool I am to think of such a thing!\" exclaimed she\nimpatiently, as she rose from the door stone. \"I am a beggar, and what\nright have I to think of being a fine lady, while my poor sick mother\nhas nothing to eat and drink? It is very hard to be so poor, but I\nsuppose it is all for the best.\"\n\n\"Do you want me, Katy?\" said a voice from the door, which Katy\nrecognized as that of Master Simon Sneed.\n\n\"I want to see you very much,\" replied Katy.\n\n\"Wait a moment, and I will join you.\"\n\nAnd in a moment Master Simon Sneed did join her; but he is so much of a\ncuriosity, and so much of a character, that I must stop to tell my\nyoung readers all about him.\n\nMaster Simon Sneed was about fifteen years old, and tall enough to have\nbeen two years older. He was very slim, and held his head very\nstraight. In 1843, the period of which I write, it was the fashion for\ngentlemen to wear straps upon their pantaloons; and accordingly Master\nSimon Sneed wore straps on his pantaloons, though, it is true, the boys\nin the street used to laugh and hoot at him for doing so; but they were\nvery ill-mannered boys, and could not appreciate the dignity of him\nthey insulted.\n\nMaster Sneed's garments were not of the finest materials, but though he\nwas a juvenile dandy, it was evident that it required a great deal of\npersonal labor to make him such.\n\nClearly those straps were sewed on by himself, and clearly those\ncowhide shoes had been thus elaborately polished by no other hands than\nhis own. In a word, the appearance of his clothes, coarse as was their\ntexture, and unfashionable as was their cut, indicated the most\nscrupulous care. It was plain that he had a fondness for dress, which\nhis circumstances did not permit him to indulge to any very great\nextent.\n\nMaster Simon Sneed was a great man in his own estimation; and, as he\nhad read a great many exciting novels, and had a good command of\nlanguage, he talked and acted like a great man. He could hold his own\nin conversation with older and wiser persons than himself. He could\nastonish almost any person of moderate pretensions by the largeness of\nhis ideas; and, of late years, his father had not pretended to hold an\nargument with him, for Simon always overwhelmed him by the force and\nelegance of his rhetoric. He spoke familiarly of great men and great\nevents.\n\nHis business relations--for Master Sneed was a business man--were not\nvery complicated. According to his own reckoning, he was the chief\nperson in the employ of Messrs. Sands & Co., wholesale and retail dry\ngood Washington Street; one who had rendered immense service to the\nfirm, and one without whom the firm could not possibly get along a\nsingle day; in short, a sort of Atlas, on whose broad shoulders the\nvast world of the Messrs. Sands & Co.'s affairs rested. But according\nto the reckoning of the firm, and the general understanding of people,\nMaster Simon was a boy in the store, whose duty it was to make fires,\nsweep out, and carry bundles, and, in  consideration of the fact that\nhe boarded himself to receive two dollars and a half a week for his\nservices. There was a vast difference between Master Simon Sneed's\nestimate of Masters Simon Sneed, and the Messrs. Sands & Co.'s idea of\nMaster Simon Sneed.\n\nBut I beg my young friends not to let anything I have written create a\nprejudice against him, for he was really a very kind-hearted young man,\nand under certain circumstances would have gone a great way to oblige a\nfriend. He had always been exceedingly well disposed towards Katy;\nperhaps it was because the simple-hearted little girl used to be so\nmuch astonished when he told her about his mercantile relations with\nthe firm of Sands & Co.; and how he managed all their business for them\nafter the store was closed at night, and before the front door was\nunlocked in the morning; how he went to the bank after immense sums of\nmoney; and how the firm would have to give up business if he should\ndie, or be obliged to leave them. Katy believed that Master Simon was a\ngreat man, and she wondered how his long, slim arms could accomplish so\nmuch labor, and how his small head could hold such a heap of\nmagnificent ideas. But Master Simon, notwithstanding his elevated\nposition in the firm, was condescending to her; he had more than once\ndone her a favor and had always expressed a lively interest in her\nwelfare. Therefore she did not scruple to apply to him in the present\nemergency.\n\n\"Well, Katy, in what manner can I serve you?\" inquired Simon, as he\nelevated his head, and stood picking his teeth before her.\n\n\"I want you to do something for me very much indeed.\"\n\n\"State your business, Katy.\"\n\n\"Dr. Flynch has been to our house to-day, and wants the rent; mother\nhasn't any money----\"\n\n\"And you wish me to lend you the amount?\" continued Simon, when Katy\nhesitated to reveal the family trouble. \"It is really unfortunate,\nKaty; it is after bank hours now, and I don't see that I can\naccommodate you.\"\n\n\"O, I don't want to borrow the money.\"\n\n\"Ah, you don't.\"\n\n\"I have got a watch here, which belonged to my father; and I want to\npawn it for the money to pay the rent.\"\n\n\"Well, it is rather out of our line of business to lend money on\ncollateral.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to lend it. I want you to take it to the\npawnbroker's. Mother says I am so young and so small that they might\ncheat me; and I thought perhaps, may be, you'd be so kind as to go with\nme.\"\n\n\"Go with you!\" exclaimed Master Simon, as he eyed her coarse, ill-made\ngarments.\n\n\"I thought you would,\" replied Katy, with a look of disappointment.\n\n\"Well, Katy, I shall be very glad to assist you in this matter, but----\"\n\nMaster Simon paused, and glanced again at the unfashionable dress of\nthe suppliant. He was, as he said, willing to aid her; but the idea of\nthe principal personage of the house of Sands & Co. walking through the\nstreets of the great city with such an ill-dressed young lady was\nabsurd, and not to be tolerated. Master Sneed reflected. It is\nundoubtedly true that \"where there is a will there is a way.\"\n\n\"Where do you wish to go?\" demanded he.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Do you know where Brattle Street is?\"\n\n\"I don't, but I can find it.\"\n\n\"Very well; important business in another street requires my personal\nattention for a moment, but I will join you in Brattle Street in a\nquarter of an hour, and attend you to a pawnbroker's.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nMaster Sneed gave her directions so that she could find the street, and\nat the end of the court, as she turned one way, he turned the other.\n\nKaty was first at the appointed place of meeting, where Simon soon\njoined her; and directing her to follow him, he led the way into\nanother street, and entered a shop.\n\n\"This young person wishes to raise some money on a watch,\" said Simon,\nas he directed the attention of the astonished broker to Katy, who was\nscarcely tall enough to be seen over the high counter.\n\n\"Let me see it.\"\n\nKaty handed up the watch, which the money lender opened and carefully\nexamined. His practised eye soon discovered that the works of the watch\nwere of the best quality.\n\n\"Where did you get this?\" asked the broker.\n\n\"My mother gave it to me;\" and Katy told without reserve the pitiful\nstory of want and destitution which compelled Mrs. Redburn to part with\nthe cherished memento of the past.\n\n\"I will give you three dollars for the watch,\" added the broker.\n\n\"Come, come, sir,\" interposed Master Simon, with a smile; \"that is a\nlittle too bad. A gentleman of your judgment and discretion has already\nassured himself that the article is worth at least twenty.\"\n\nThe broker drew a long breath after this speech, and seemed very much\nimpressed by the style of the remark. But Katy declared she did not\nwant to sell the watch, only to pawn it.\n\n\"Your story is not a very plausible one,\" said the broker, \"and there\nis some risk in taking it.\"\n\n\"I give you my personal assurance, on honor that her story is all\ntrue,\" added Simon.\n\nThe broker burst out into a loud laugh. He could not stand Simon's fine\nspeeches, and would not take the watch at any rate; so they departed to\nfind another place, and entered a shop close by.\n\n\"Where did you get this?\" asked the broker sourly, and Katy repeated\nher story, and Simon vouched for its truth.\n\n\"It is all a lie,\" exclaimed the broker, \"I will put the watch into my\nsafe and hand it over to the police.\"\n\n\"This is a most extraordinary proceeding,\" protested Master Simon.\n\n\"Get out of the shop, both of you, or I will hand you over to the\npolice! You stole the watch, and have the audacity to bring it into the\nshop of an honest man. I don't buy stolen goods.\"\n\nKaty began to cry, as the last hope of redemption from the fangs of Dr.\nFlynch fled. Even Master Simon Sneed was alarmed at the idea of being\nhanded over to the police; but his sense of dignity compelled him to\nenter his earnest protest, against the proceeding of the broker, and\neven to threaten him with the terrors of the law. The money-lender\nrepeated his menace, and even went to the door, for the apparent\npurpose of putting it into execution.\n\n\"Come, Katy, let us go; but I assure you I will represent this outrage\nto my friend the mayor, in such a manner that entire justice shall be\ndone you,\" whispered Simon. \"I cannot remain any longer away from my\nbusiness, or I would recover the watch at once.\"\n\n\"O, dear! my poor mother!\" sobbed Katy.\n\n\"Don't cry, my child; leave it all to me, and run home as fast as you\ncan. You shall have the watch again, for I will call in the whole\npolice force of Boston to your aid;\" and Master Simon ran away to\nattend to the affairs of Sands & Co., which Katy innocently concluded\nmust be suffering by this time from his absence.\n\nPoor Katy! with a heavy heart she wandered home to tell her mother of\nthis new misfortune.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nKATY MATURES A MAGNIFICENT SCHEME.\n\n\"I suppose it is all for the best, mother,\" said Katy, when she had\ntold her sad story of disappointment. \"I can't get those words out of\nmy head, since you have told me about my father. I feel just as though\neverything would come out right, it does go very bad just now.\"\n\n\"I am glad you feel so, Katy,\" added Mrs. Redburn. \"It will make you\nmuch better contented with your lot. I have suffered so much that I\ncannot help repining a little, though I feel that my destiny and yours\nis in the hands of the wise Father, who bringeth good out of evil.\"\n\nKaty had not yet reached that spirit of meek submission to the will of\nHeaven which looks upward in the hour of trial, not doubting that the\nall-wise God knows best what is for the good of his children. If she\nbelieved that misfortunes were all for the best, it was only an impulse\nderived from the story of her father; a kind of philosophy which was\nvery convenient for the evil day, because it permitted the sufferer to\nlie down and take things easily. It was not a filial trust in the\nwisdom and mercy of the heavenly Father that sustained her as the\nclouds grew thicker and blacker around her; it was only a cold\nindifference, a feeling of the head rather than the heart.\n\nBut Mrs. Redburn had been reading the New Testament during Katy's\nabsence, and a better and purer spirit pervaded her soul than when the\nweight of the blow first struck so heavily upon her. She was well\neducated, and capable of reasoning in a just manner over her\nmisfortunes; and those words on the watch seemed to convey a new\nmeaning to her, as she considered them in the light of Christian\nrevelation. They were not the basis of a cold philosophy; they assured\nher of the paternal care of God. The thought strengthened and revived\nher, and when Katy appeared to announce a new trial, she received the\nintelligence with calmness, and felt more ready than ever before to\nleave her destiny in the hands of Heaven. For an hour she conversed\nwith Katy on this subject, and succeeded in giving her some new views\nin relation to the meaning of the words she had so often repeated that\nafternoon.\n\nThe poor girl felt as she had never felt before. Upon her devolved the\nresponsibility of providing for her mother. She had no other friend,\nand that day seemed to open a new era in her existence. She felt strong\nfor the work before her, and resolved to lose not a single day in\nputting her resolution into operation. The teachings of her mother,\nbreathing a spirit of piety and resignation, were grateful to her\nheart, and added new strength to her arm.\n\nThere was still food enough in the house for Katy's supper, for her\nmother could not eat, though she drank a cup of tea. The morning sun\nwould shine upon them again, bringing another day of want and\nwretchedness, but the poor girl banished her fears, trusting for the\nmorrow to Him who feedeth the hungry raven, and tempereth the wind to\nthe shorn lamb.\n\nShe laid her head upon her pillow that night, not to sleep for many a\nweary hour, but to think of the future; not of its sorrows and\ntreasured ills, but of the golden opportunities it would afford her to\ndo something for her sick mother. At one o'clock the next day Dr.\nFlynch would come for the rent again and her mother could not pay him.\nShe felt assured he was cold and cruel enough to execute his wicked\nthreat to turn them out of the house, though her mother had not been\noff her bed for many weeks. What could be done? They could not pay the\nrent; that was impossible; and she regarded it as just as impossible to\nmelt the heart of Dr. Flynch. But long before she went to sleep she had\ndecided what to do.\n\nWorn out with fatigue and anxiety, she did not wake till a late hour;\nand her mother, who had kept a weary vigil all night, was glad to see\nher sleep so well, and did not arouse her. She was refreshed by her\ndeep slumbers, and got up feeling like a new creature. She had scarcely\nmade a fire and put on the tea-kettle, before a knock at the door\nstartled her. Who could wish to see them in their poverty and\nwant?--who but some evil person, coming to heap some new grief upon\nthem? She scarcely had the courage to open the door, but when she did\nso, she saw the smiling face of Tommy Howard.\n\n\"Good morning, Katy,\" said he, as he handed her a little basket he had\nbrought. \"Mother sent this over, and wants to know how Mrs. Redburn\ndoes to-day.\"\n\n\"She is about the same. What is in this basket, Tommy?\"\n\n\"O, you know;\" and he turned to run away.\n\n\"Stop a minute, Tommy,\" called Katy. \"I want to speak to you.\"\n\n\"Well, what is it?\"\n\n\"You haven't told anybody about it--have you?\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"What I told you yesterday,\" replied Katy, hanging her head with shame.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"That we had nothing to eat,\" and Katy blushed as though it was a crime\nto be hungry and have nothing to eat.\n\n\"Not a soul--catch me! that is, I hain't told nobody but mother.\"\n\n\"I am sorry you did, even her. My mother is very proud, if she is poor;\nbut she wasn't always so poor as she is now, for she is the daughter of\na rich merchant.\"\n\n\"You don't say so.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do, Tommy; so please don't say a word about it to anybody but\nyour mother, and ask her not to mention it.\"\n\n\"Not a word, Katy, mother won't say a word either.\"\n\n\"And sometime I'll tell you all about it. Thank you for what's in the\nbasket, Tommy.\"\n\nWithout waiting for anything more, the noble, generous boy leaped down\nthe stairs and passed out at the front door.\n\n\"What have you got there, Katy?\" asked Mrs. Redburn, as she entered the\nroom with the basket in her hand.\n\n\"Something Mrs. Howard sent us,\" she replied, as she opened the basket,\nand took out a plate of butter and half a dozen hot biscuit, which she\ncarried to the bedside for her mother's inspection.\n\n\"What have you done, my child?\" exclaimed the poor woman, a flush\ngathering on her pale cheek. \"Have you told the neighbors that we have\nnothing to eat?\"\n\n\"I couldn't help telling Tommy when I asked for the flounders\nyesterday; he told his mother, but no one else knows it.\"\n\n\"I had rather starve than beg, Katy; but I cannot compel you to do so.\"\n\n\"I will not beg.\"\n\n\"Then let us send those cakes back.\"\n\n\"No, mother; we must not be so proud as that. I think that God sent us\nthis food through Mrs. Howard, and it would be wicked to reject His\nbounty.\"\n\n\"Do as you please, Katy.\"\n\n\"Some time we shall be able to pay her; and that will make it all\nright.\"\n\nMrs. Redburn could not taste the biscuit, but Katy ate heartily. Her\npride was not inflated by the remembrance of brighter days. All she had\nwas inherited from her mother.\n\nAfter breakfast she put on her bonnet and left the house, assuring her\nmother she should be back by twelve o'clock. She would not tell her\nwhere she was going, but evaded her questions, and got away as soon as\nshe could.\n\nAs she passed down Washington Street, she stopped before the store of\nSands & Co., for she wanted to see Master Simon Sneed. She did not like\nto enter the store; so she waited on the sidewalk for half an hour,\nhoping he would come out. As he did not appear, her impatience would\nnot permit her to lose any more time, and she timidly opened the door,\nand inquired of the first salesman she saw if Mister Sneed was in.\n\n\"Mister Sneed!\" laughed the clerk. \"Here, Simon, is one of your\nfriends. Wait upon her.\"\n\nSimon, with a flushed cheek, came to the door. He was horrified at the\ninsinuation of the salesman and wished Katy had been on the other side\nof the ocean before she had come there to scandalize him by claiming\nhis acquaintance.\n\n\"What do you want now?\" he demanded, rather rudely. \"Is it not enough\nthat I am willing to help you, without your coming here to bring me\ninto contempt with my associates?\"\n\n\"I didn't think there was any harm in it. I waited outside for half an\nhour, and you didn't come out.\"\n\n\"I can't leave the affairs of this firm to attend to every little----\"\nand Master Simon's naturally good heart prevented him from uttering the\nunkind words that had been on his tongue. \"I suppose you come to know\nabout the watch. I haven't had time to call upon the mayor yet, but I\nwill do so at dinner time.\"\n\n\"I only wanted to ask you if you know where Mrs. Gordon lives,\" replied\nKaty, very sad at the thought of the mischief she had done.\n\n\"She lives in Temple Street, over back of the State House. What do you\nwant of her?\"\n\n\"I want to see her. Do you suppose you can get that watch back?\"\n\n\"I'm certain I can. When my friend the mayor hears my story, you may\ndepend upon it he will get the watch, or upset all the pawn-brokers'\nshops in the city.\"\n\n\"Are you acquainted with the mayor?\" asked Katy, timidly, for, since\nthe adventure of the previous day, she had entertained some slight\ndoubts in regard to the transcendent abilities of Master Simon Sneed.\n\n\"Certainly I am. It was only last week that I had a long and extremely\ninteresting conversation with his honor on the sidewalk here before the\nstore.\"\n\nKaty was satisfied, though Simon did not offer to introduce her to his\ndistinguished friend. How could she help being satisfied in the face of\nsuch astounding evidence? And Simon's declaration was true, for\nwhatever faults he had, he never made up a story out of whole cloth. It\nwas undeniably true that he had conversed with the mayor for ten full\nminutes, at the time and place represented. Simon had been sent out to\nhold his honor's horse, while a lady with him did some shopping; but\nhis honor preferred to hold his own horse, and amused himself for the\ntime in listening to the big talk of the nice young man.\n\nAfter receiving more explicit directions in regard to the residence of\nMrs. Gordon, Katy took her leave of Simon. Next door to Sands & Co.'s\nwas the store of a celebrated confectioner. In the window, with sundry\nsugar temples, cob houses of braided candy and stacks of cake, was a\ngreat heap of molasses candy; and as Katy paused for an instant to gaze\nat the profusion of sweet things, a great thought struck through her\nbrain.\n\n\"Mother used to make molasses candy for me, and I know just how it is\ndone,\" said she to herself. \"What is the reason I can't make candy and\nsell it?\"\n\nShe walked on towards School Street, up which she had been directed to\nturn, full of this idea. She would become a little candy merchant. She\nfelt sure she could find purchasers enough, if her merchandise only\nlooked clean and good. It was a great deal better than begging, and she\nthought her mother would consent to her making and selling the candy.\nWhat a glorious idea! If she could only make money enough to support\nher mother and herself, how happy she should be!\n\nFull of enthusiasm at the idea of accomplishing such a vast project,\nshe scarcely heeded the crowds of people that thronged the street and\nrudely jostled her. If she saw them at all, it was only to regard them\nas so many purchasers of molasses candy. With her brain almost reeling\nwith the immensity and magnificence of her scheme, she reached Temple\nStreet. After a little search, she found the number of Mrs. Gordon's\nresidence on a splendid house, whose grandness quite abashed her. But\nher courage revived as she thought of the purpose that had brought her\nthere, and she boldly rang the bell. The door was opened by a servant\nman in a white jacket, of whom she inquired if Mrs. Gordon was at home.\n\n\"Mrs. Gordon is at home, but we don't trouble her at the call of a\nbeggar,\" replied the well-fed servant as he glanced at the homely\napparel of Katy.\n\n\"I am not a beggar,\" she replied, with spirit, her cheek reddening with\nindignation at the charge.\n\n\"You can't see her; so go about your business.\"\n\n\"Who is it Michael?\" said a gentle voice within.\n\n\"Only a beggar, Miss Grace; she wants to see Mrs. Gordon,\" replied the\nman; and then a beautiful young lady came to look at her.\n\n\"I am not a beggar, ma'am; indeed I am not. I want to see Mrs. Gordon\nvery much. Please to let me speak to her.\"\n\nThe sweet, pleading tones of the child produced their impression on the\nbeautiful lady, and she bade her come in. Katy entered, and Michael\ntold her to stand in the entry while Miss Grace went up-stairs to call\nMrs. Gordon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nKATY VISITS MRS. GORDON, AND GETS RID OF DR. FLYNCH.\n\nKaty gazed with wonder and admiration at the rich furniture of the\nhouse, and thought that perhaps her grandfather lived in as good style\nas Mrs. Gordon, and that she might some day go to Liverpool and be an\ninmate of just such a palace. The door of the sitting-room was open,\nand she had an opportunity to look at all the fine things it contained.\nShe had never seen anything so luxurious before, and I must say that\nshe regretted the poverty of her lot, which deprived her mother and\nherself of them.\n\nAll round the room hung pictures in costly frames. Some of them were\nportraits; and one which hung over the mantelpiece directly before her,\nsoon attracted her attention, and made her forget the soft divans, the\nbeautiful carpet, and the rich draperies of the windows. It was the\nportrait of a lady, and her expression was very like that of her\nmother--so like that she could almost believe the picture had been\npainted for her mother. Yet that could not be, for the lady was young,\nand plump, and rosy, and wore rich laces, and a costly dress. She\nseemed to look down upon her from the golden frame with a smile of\nsatisfaction. There was something roguish in her eye, as though she was\non the point of bursting into a laugh at some mischief she had\nperpetrated. O, no! that could not be her mother; she had never seen\nher look like that. But there was something that seemed very much like\nher; and the more she looked at it, the more the picture fascinated\nher. She tried to look at something else, but the lady appeared to have\nfixed her gaze upon her, and, whichever way she turned, those laughing\neyes followed her, and brought back her attention to the canvas again.\n\nIn vain she attempted to fasten her mind upon some of the other\nportraits. There was an elderly gentleman, with a full red face; but\nthe jealous lady would not let her look at him. She turned round and\nlooked out the windows at the side of the door; but the spell of the\nlady was upon her, and she could not resist the charm. The more she\nstudied the portrait, the more convinced she became that it looked like\nher mother, though there was something about it which was as unlike her\nas anything could be. \"What makes you keep looking at me?\" said Katy to\nherself, or rather to the lady on the canvas. \"You needn't watch me so\nclosely; I shall not steal anything.\"\n\nThe lady, however, insisted on watching her, and kept her roguish\nglance fixed upon her with a steadiness that began to make her feel\nnervous and uneasy; and she was greatly relieved when she heard\nfootsteps on the stairs.\n\n\"Mrs. Gordon will be down in a moment,\" said Miss Grace, in kind tones.\n\"Won't you come into this room and sit down?\"\n\nKaty thanked her, and Grace led her to a small chair directly under the\nmischievous-looking lady in the frame; and she felt a kind of\nsatisfaction in being placed out of her sight. But it seemed, even\nthen, as she cast a furtive glance upward, that those roguish eyes were\ntrying to peer over the picture frame, and get a look at her.\n\n\"Well, little girl, what do you wish with me?\" said Mrs. Gordon, a\nbenevolent looking lady, apparently of more than forty years of age,\nwho now entered the room.\n\nThe expression of her countenance was very pleasant, and though there\nwere a few wrinkles on her brow and she wore a lace cap, Katy came to\nthe conclusion that the portrait had been taken for her. She wondered\nif such a dignified lady could ever have been so roguish as the picture\nindicated.\n\n\"Please, ma'am,\" stammered she, rising from her chair, \"I come to see\nyou about the house we live in.\"\n\n\"What is your name, child?\"\n\n\"Katy Redburn, ma'am.\"\n\n\"In what house do you live in?\"\n\n\"In one of yours in Colvin Court. Mother is a poor woman, and has been\nsick so much this summer that she can't pay the rent.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry for you, my child, but I refer you to my agent, Dr.\nFlynch. I do not like to meddle with these things, as I have given him\nthe whole care of my houses. You will find him a very good man, and one\nwho will be willing to consider your case. He will extend to you all\nthe lenity your case requires.\"\n\n\"We have told Dr. Flynch all about it, ma'am and he says if the rent is\nnot paid by one o'clock to-day, he shall turn us out of the house.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" exclaimed Mrs. Gordon; and Grace actually jumped out of her\nchair with astonishment and indignation.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; that's just what he said,\" added Katy, satisfied with the\nimpression she had produced.\n\n\"Is your mother ill now?\" asked Mrs. Gordon.\n\n\"Yes ma'am; she has not been off her bed for twelve weeks.\"\n\n\"What does Dr. Flynch say, my child?\"\n\n\"He says my mother deceived him; that she told him a falsehood; and\nthat she had money, when she didn't have a cent.\"\n\n\"It is too bad, mother!\" exclaimed Grace.\n\n\"Hush, Grace; probably Dr. Flynch knows best, for he certainly would\nnot turn a poor sick woman out of doors because she did not pay the\nrent. There may be, as he says, some deception about it, which he can\npenetrate and we cannot.\"\n\n\"There is no deception about it, ma'am,\" pleaded Katy, much disturbed\nby this sudden damper upon her hopes. \"She has not got a single cent.\nShe wouldn't tell a lie, and I wouldn't either.\"\n\nThere was something in the eloquence and earnestness of the child that\ndeeply impressed the mind of the lady, and she could hardly resist the\nconclusion that her agent had, in this instance, made a mistake. But\nshe had great confidence in Dr. Flynch, and she was very unwilling to\nbelieve that he could be so harsh and cruel as the little girl\nrepresented. She had heard of the tricks of the vicious poor, and while\nshe was disposed to be very tender of a needy tenant, she must be just\nto her agent.\n\n\"It is now half-past ten,\" continued Mrs. Gordon.\n\n\"You shall remain here, my child, and I will send Michael down to\nColvin Court to inquire into the situation of your mother. He must be\nimpartial for he knows nothing about the case.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" said Katy, with a promptness which assured Grace,\nif not her mother, that the little girl was honest.\n\nMrs. Gordon rang the bell, and when Michael answered the summons, she\nattended him to the street door, where she instructed him to call upon\nMrs. Redburn, and also to inquire of the grocer at the corner, and of\nher neighbors, what sort of a person she was. The lady returned to the\nsitting-room when he had gone, and asked Katy a great many questions\nabout herself and her mother, and thus nearly an hour was consumed, at\nthe end of which time Michael returned. Katy had answered all the\nlady's questions fairly, though without betraying her family history,\nwhich her mother had cautioned her to keep to herself, that she was\nprepared to receive a favorable report from her man.\n\n\"Well, Michael, did you find the woman at home?\" asked Mrs. Gordon, as\nthe man presented himself.\n\n\"Indeed, I deed, marm.\"\n\n\"What was she doing?\"\n\n\"She was fast in bed, and told me she hadn't been out of it for twelve\nweeks come Saturday.\"\n\n\"What does the grocer say?\"\n\n\"He says she is a very good woman, but poor and proud. She always paid\nhim every cent she owed him, and he'd trust her for half he has in his\nshop.\"\n\n\"That will do, Michael; you may go;\" and the man retired with a\nrespectful bow.\n\nKaty's face wore a smile of triumph, as Michael was dismissed. Her\nmother's truthfulness had been vindicated, and it was the proudest\nmoment she had known for many a day.\n\n\"How long has your mother lived in my house?\" asked Mrs. Gordon.\n\n\"About three years, ma'am; and she always paid her rent till this\nmonth,\" replied Katy.\n\n\"If she had not, Dr. Flynch would have turned her into the street,\"\nadded Grace; and it was evident the beautiful young lady had no special\nregard for that worthy gentleman.\n\n\"We have tried hard enough to pay the rent this month,\" continued Katy;\nand she proceeded to tell the story of the silver watch, that had\nbelonged to her father.\n\n\"This is dreadful, mother; let us do something about it,\" said Grace.\n\"What a wretch the broker must have been!\"\n\n\"We will endeavor to get the watch back for her,\" replied Mrs. Gordon,\nas she seated herself at a table and wrote a few lines on a piece of\npaper. \"Here, my child, is a receipt for your month's rent. When Dr.\nFlynch comes for the money, you show him this, and he will be\nsatisfied;\" and she handed her the receipt.\n\nKaty took it, and thanked the good lady, assuring her that her mother\nwould certainly pay the money as soon as she got well.\n\n\"My mother is poor and proud, just as the grocer said, and she don't\nask any one to give her anything. I am going to earn some money myself,\nand I hope I shall be able to pay the next month's rent,\" added Katy,\nas she moved towards the door.\n\n\"But the watch, mother?\" interposed Grace.\n\n\"If the little girl will come here this afternoon or to-morrow morning,\nwe will take her to the mayor who will have the case attended to.\"\n\n\"I will come any time, ma'am.\"\n\n\"The mayor is my friend, and I will call at his house with you this\nafternoon at three o'clock.\"\n\nKaty could not but think the mayor had a great many friends, for there\nwas Master Simon Sneed, and Mrs. Gordon, and she knew not how many\nmore. She thanked the lady very warmly for her kindness, and promising\nto come at the time stated, she took her leave.\n\nShe was followed to the door by Grace, who detained her there.\n\n\"Katy, I am sure you are a very good little girl, and here is a dollar\nfor you. It will buy something good for your mother.\"\n\n\"I thank you very much, Miss Gordon. I am poor, but proud, like my\nmother,\" replied she, as a flush of shame mantled her cheek.\n\n\"What a foolish little girl!\" laughed Grace. \"Take it; you will oblige\nme very much by taking it.\"\n\n\"No, ma'am, I can't; my mother wouldn't own me if I should take money\nas a gift.\"\n\n\"But you must take it, Katy; I shall be angry if you don't.\"\n\nThe little girl looked up into her pretty eyes beaming with pity and\nlove; and she could hardly resist the temptation to oblige her by\naccepting the gift; but since she had heard the story of her mother's\nlife, she understood why she was so much prouder than other poor\npeople; and as she thought of her grandfather in his fine house in the\ngreat city of Liverpool, she felt a little of the same spirit--she too\nwas poor and proud. Besides, as Grace jingled the two half dollars\ntogether, there was a harmony in the sound that suggested a great heap\nof good things for her mother. And there was another powerful\nconsideration that weighed with great force upon her mind. One of those\nhalf dollars would be a sufficient capital upon which to commence her\ncandy speculation. It would buy ever so much molasses of the very best\nquality. As she thought of this, she was disposed, at least, to\ncompromise with Miss Grace.\n\n\"I cannot accept the money as a gift, but you may lend it to me, if you\nplease,\" said Katy, after she had reflected a moment.\n\n\"Just as you like,\" laughed Grace; \"but I shall not feel bad if you\nnever pay me.\"\n\n\"I shall certainly pay it again,\" persisted the embryo candy merchant.\n\"I would not take it if I thought I could not.\"\n\n\"Very well; but you must know I think you are a very singular little\ngirl.\"\n\n\"I am poor and proud; that's all.\"\n\nKaty took the loan, and with her fancy fired with brilliant\nexpectations in regard to the candy operation, ran home to her mother\nas fast as her feet would carry her. Mrs. Redburn was much displeased\nwith her at first for what she had done. Her pride revolted at the\nthought of begging a favor; but Katy explained the matter so well that\nshe was satisfied, though nothing was said about the loan she had\nobtained.\n\nPunctually at the appointed hour came Dr. Flynch for the rent.\n\n\"Have you got the money?\" he demanded in his usual bland tones, though\nKaty thought she could see a wicked purpose in his little gray eye.\n\n\"No, sir; but----\"\n\n\"That's all I desire to know, Mrs. Redburn,\" interrupted the agent.\n\"You must leave the house.\"\n\n\"But, sir, I have something that will do as well as the money,\" added\nthe sick woman.\n\n\"Have you, indeed?\" sneered Dr. Flynch \"I think not.\"\n\n\"Will you read that, sir?\" said Katy, handing him Mrs. Gordon's receipt.\n\nThe agent took the paper, and as he read, the wonted serenity of his\nbrow was displaced by a dark scowl. His threats had been disregarded,\nand he had been reported to his employer.\n\n\"So you have been fawning and cringing upon Mrs. Gordon,\" growled he.\n\"Probably you have told her more lies than you dared tell me.\"\n\n\"I told her nothing but the truth, and she sent her man down here to\nfind out all about us, said Katy, smartly.\n\n\"Very well; this paper will only delay the matter for a few days; when\nI have exposed you to her, she will acquiesce in my views;\" and Dr.\nFlynch threw down the receipt and left the house.\n\n\"We are well rid of him, at any rate,\" said Katy.\n\n\"Now I will get you some dinner, for I must be at Mrs. Gordon's at\nthree o'clock; and I want to tell you about my plan too, mother.\"\n\nThe active little girl made a cup of tea for her mother, and the dinner\nwas soon dispatched.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nKATY PREPARES A STOCK OF MERCHANDISE.\n\nKaty had not time then to tell her mother about the candy speculation\nshe had in view, and she was obliged to wait till her return from\nTemple Street. Promptly at the hour, she presented herself at Mrs.\nGordon's, and they went to the house of the mayor; but that\ndistinguished gentleman was not at home, and the lady promised to go\nagain with her the next day.\n\nAs she walked home, she thought of what she should say to her mother in\nfavor of the candy project, for she felt sure her mother's pride would\nthrow many obstacles in her path. The best argument she could think of\nwas, that the business would be an honest calling and though she was\ntoo proud to beg, she was not too proud to work, or to take a very\nhumble position among the people around her. She did not look upon the\nact of selling candy to the passers-by in the streets as degrading in\nitself, and therein she differed very widely from her mother, who had\nbeen brought up in ease and affluence. Before she got home she had made\nup her mind what she should say, and how she should defend her plan\nfrom the assaults of pride.\n\n\"Now, mother, you shall hear my plan,\" she continued, after she had\nannounced the ill success of her visit to the mayor's house. \"I am\ngoing into business, and I expect to make a great deal of money.\"\n\n\"Are you, indeed?\" replied Mrs. Redburn, smiling at the enthusiasm of\nher daughter.\n\n\"I am; and you must not be angry with me, or object very much to my\nplan.\"\n\n\"Well, what is your plan?\"\n\n\"I am going to sell candy,\" said Katy, pausing to notice the effect of\nthis startling declaration. \"You know what nice molasses candy you used\nto make for me. Mrs. Sneed and Mrs. Colvin said a great many times that\nit was a good deal better than they could buy at the shops.\"\n\n\"But, child, I am not able to make candy now. I cannot get off my bed.\"\n\n\"I will make it; you shall lay there and tell me how. I am sure I can\nmake it.\"\n\n\"It is very hard work to pull it.\"\n\n\"I won't mind that.\"\n\n\"Suppose you can make it, how will you sell it?\" asked Mrs. Redburn,\ncasting an anxious glance at the enthusiastic little girl.\n\n\"O, I shall take a box, and offer it to the folks that pass along the\nstreets.\"\n\n\"Are you crazy, Katy?\" exclaimed the mother, raising her head on the\nbed. \"Do you think I could permit you to do such a thing?\"\n\n\"Why not, mother?\"\n\n\"What a life for a child to lead! Do you think I could let you wander\nabout the streets exposed to the insults and rude jests of the vicious\nand thoughtless? You do not understand what you propose.\"\n\n\"I think I do, mother. I don't see any harm in selling candy to those\nwho are willing to buy.\"\n\n\"Perhaps there is no harm in the mere act of selling candy; but what a\nlife for you to lead! It makes me shudder to think of it.\"\n\n\"It is your pride, mother.\"\n\n\"I am thankful I have: some pride left, Katy.\"\n\n\"But mother, we can't be poor and proud. We haven't got any money to\nproud with.\"\n\n\"I am proud, I know; I wish I could banish it,\" replied Mrs. Redburn,\nwith a deep sigh.\n\n\"Let me try the plan, mother, and if I can't get along with it, I will\ngive it up.\"\n\n\"It will subject you to a great many trials and temptations.\"\n\n\"I can manage them, mother.\"\n\n\"Can you submit to the insults of evil-minded persons?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother; no decent person would insult me and I don't care for\nothers. I can pity them, and run away from them. I am not afraid of\nanything. Do let me try.\"\n\nMrs. Redburn saw that Katy was too earnest to be thwarted; that,\nimpelled by a noble purpose, she had set her heart upon making the\nattempt, and she did not like to disappoint her. It is true, she keenly\nfelt the degradation of such a life, and even feared that Katy might be\nled astray while pursuing such an occupation; but she gave a reluctant\nconsent, trusting that one or two experiments would disgust her with\nthe business.\n\nKaty clapped her hands with joy as her mother's scruples gave way, and\nshe found herself at liberty to carry her plan into execution. It\nseemed to her as though she had crossed the threshold of fortune and\nhad actually entered the great temple. She had an opportunity to\naccomplish a great work, and her enthusiasm would not permit her to\ndoubt in regard to her final success.\n\n\"I must begin now, mother, and make all the candy this afternoon, so\nthat I can commence selling it early to-morrow morning. I will go to\nthe grocery now and get the molasses.\"\n\n\"Poor child; you have nothing to get it with. We have no money; you did\nnot think of that.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did, and I have the money to buy the molasses. I borrowed it,\"\nreplied Katy, evincing some confusion.\n\n\"You borrowed it? Pray who would lend you money?\"\n\n\"Miss Grace Gordon.\"\n\n\"Did you borrow it, Katy?\" asked Mrs. Redburn, casting a reproachful\nglance at her.\n\n\"Yes, mother, I did. I would not accept money now, after what you have\nsaid to me. Miss Grace wanted to give it to me; but I told her I could\nnot take it. She laughed at me, and I said I was poor and proud. She\nwould make me take it, and said so much, that, at last, I told her if\nshe would lend it to me, I would take it.\"\n\n\"It was the same as a gift,\" said Mrs. Redburn, blushing with shame at\nthe thought of accepting alms.\n\n\"No, it wasn't; she may think it was, but I mean to pay her, and I\nshall pay her; I know I shall.\"\n\n\"If you can,\" sighed the proud mother.\n\n\"I shall be able to pay her soon, for I mean to sell lots of candy.\"\n\n\"You may be disappointed.\"\n\n\"No: I am sure I shall sell a good deal; I mean to make people buy. I\nshall talk up smart to them just as the shopkeepers do; I am going to\ntell them what candy it is, and that their little sons and daughters\nwill like it very much.\"\n\n\"You are beside yourself, Katy. It pains me to hear you talk so. It is\nsad to think a child of mine should relish such an employment as that\nin which you are going to engage.\"\n\n\"Do you remember the book my Sunday-school teacher gave me last New\nYear's day, mother? It was all about false pride; I want you to read\nit, mother. We can't afford to be so proud.\"\n\n\"Go and get your molasses. Katy,\" replied Mrs. Redburn, who could not\nbut acknowledge the truth of her daughter's remarks.\n\nShe had read the book alluded to, and was not willing to confront the\narguments it had put in the mouth of her child. She was conscious that\nher pride, which made a humble occupation repulsive to her, was a false\npride. If it could have been carried on in private, it would not have\nseemed so galling. For years she had been a recluse from society,\nmingling only with her humble neighbors, and with them no more than her\ncircumstances required. She had labored in solitude, and shunned\nobservation as much as possible, by carrying her work back and forth in\nthe evening. Years of hard toil had not familiarized her with the\ncircumstances of her lot. She tried to be humble and submissive, but\nthe memory of her early days could not be driven away.\n\nKaty returned in a few minutes with the jug of molasses. She bustled\nround and made up a good fire, got the kettle on, and everything in\nreadiness for the work. Her mother gave her directions how to proceed;\nbut Katy could impart to her none of her own enthusiasm.\n\nWhen the molasses had been cooked enough, she was ready to commence the\npulling, which was the most difficult part in the manufacture of her\nmerchandise. Then she found that her trials had indeed commenced. At\nfirst the sticky mass, in spite of the butter and the flour with which\nshe had plentifully daubed her hands, was as obstinate as a mule. It\nwould not work one way or another; now it melted down, and stuck to her\nfingers, and then it became as solid as a rock. She fretted some at\nthese crosses, and as her spirits sank, her mother's rose, for she\nthought Katy's resolution would not hold out long enough for her to\ncomplete the experiment. But she underrated the energy of the devoted\ngirl, who, in the face of every discouragement, stuck to the candy with\nas much zeal as the candy stuck to her.\n\nAs is almost always the case with those who persevere to the end, Katy\nsoon won a partial triumph, which gladdened her heart, and gave her\ncourage to continue her trying labors. She had worked a portion of the\nmass into candy--clear, light-colored, inviting candy. Columbus felt no\nprouder of his achievement when he had crossed the Atlantic, or,\nNapoleon when he had crossed the Alps. She danced for joy as she gazed\nupon the clear, straight sticks of candy, as they were arranged in the\npan. It was a great conquest for her; but at what a sacrifice it had\nbeen won! Her little hands, unused to such hard work, were blistered in\na dozen places, and smarted as though they had been scalded with\nboiling water. She showed them to her mother, who begged her not to do\nany more; but she had too much enthusiasm to be deterred by the smart\nof her wounds, and resolutely resumed her labor.\n\nShe had scarcely commenced upon the  second mass before she was\ninterrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Howard, her friend Tommy's mother.\n\n\"Why, what are you doing, child?\" asked the good woman. \"I thought you\nwere all sick, and here you are making candy, as merry as on a feast\nday.\"\n\n\"I am making it to sell, Mrs. Howard,\" replied Katy, proudly.\n\n\"Bless me! but you're a queer child! Do you think folks will buy it of\nyou?\"\n\n\"I know they will;\" and Katy detailed her plan to the interested\nneighbor, declaring she was sure she could support her mother and\nherself by making and selling candy. \"But it is very hard work,\" she\nadded; \"see how I've blistered my hands.\"\n\n\"Poor child! it's enough to kill you!\" exclaimed Mrs. Howard, as she\nglanced at the great blisters on Katy's hands.\n\n\"I have been trying to make her give up the idea, but she has more\ncourage than I ever gave her credit for,\" remarked Mrs. Redburn.\n\n\"It's a shame for you to hurt your hands in this manner; but I dare say\nthat they will soon get hard, like mine, with the labor,\" replied Mrs.\nHoward, as she threw off her hood and rolled up her sleeves. \"Here,\nchild, let me help you.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, ma'am; and I hope I shall be able to do something\nfor you some time.\"\n\n\"Never you mind that; you are a nice girl, and it does my heart good to\nsee you trying to help your mother,\" added the kind woman, as she\ndetached a large mass of candy, and commenced pulling it with a vigor\nthat astonished the weak-handed little girl. \"You're a jewel and a\nblessing, and you're worth a dozen of the fine ladies that are too\nproud to lift a finger to keep their bodies from starving. Ah, it's a\ndreadful misfortune to be proud.\"\n\n\"To be poor and proud,\" said Mrs. Redburn.\n\n\"You are right, ma'am; and I am glad to see you have none of it here;\nfor some of your neighbors used to say you were too proud to speak to\nthem.\"\n\nMrs. Redburn made no reply, and permitted her kind neighbor, whose\ntongue scarcely ceased to swing for a moment, to continue her remarks\nwithout opposition. She and Katy worked with all their might till the\ncandy was ready for market, and when the poor invalid poured out her\nthanks, she ran off and left them.\n\nThe exultation with which Katy regarded her plentiful stock of\nmerchandise almost caused her to forget her smarting hands; and when\nshe could no longer keep her eyes open, she went to sleep to dream of\ngreat operations in molasses candy on change next day.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nKATY MAKES A LARGE SALE.\n\nKaty rose the next morning bright and early, and her heart was full of\nhope. She felt that she had a great work to perform, and she was going\nforth to do it, resolved that no obstacle should turn her back. Her\nmother had told her that she would be laughed at, and made fun of; that\nthoughtless people would look down upon her with contempt, and that\nwicked ones would insult her. She was, therefore, prepared for all\nthese trials, but she had braced herself up to meet them with courage\nand fortitude.\n\nHer mother was sick, and they were actually in a suffering condition.\nWhat right had she to be proud in her poverty? She felt able to support\nher mother, and she could find no excuse, if she wished to do so, for\nnot supporting her. It was her duty, therefore, to sell candy if she\ncould get money by it; and thus consideration strengthened her heart.\n\nKaty had been to the public school and to the Sunday school until her\nmother was taken sick; and though she was only eleven years old, she\nhad a very good idea of her moral and religious duties. \"Honor thy\nfather and thy mother,\" the commandment says; and she could think of no\nbetter way to obey the divine precept than to support her mother when\nthere was no one else upon whom she could rely. Little by little their\nearthly possessions had passed away. Mrs. Redburn had never learned how\nto save money; and when the day of adversity came, her funds were soon\nexhausted. She had no friends to whom she dared reveal her poverty, and\nwhen want came to the door, she was too proud to beg. Hoping for better\ndays, she had sold most of her best dresses, and those of Katy. The\nsmall sums raised by these sacrifices were soon used up; and when the\ndaughter could no longer make a decent appearance, she was required to\nshow herself much more than ever before. Katy did not repine at this,\nthough her mother did, for their pride, as my young friends have\ndiscovered, was of very different kinds.\n\nKaty did wish she had a little better dress, and a little better bonnet\nfor her first attempt in the mercantile calling; but there was no help\nfor it. She had mended her clothes as well as she could, and as they\nwere clean, she was pretty well satisfied with her personal appearance.\nBesides, people would not be half so apt to buy her candy if she were\nwell dressed, as if she were rather plainly clothed. In short, it was\nall for the best.\n\nAfter breakfast she prepared herself for the duties of the day. Her\nheart beat violently with anxiety and expectation, and while she was\nplacing the candy on the tray, which she had previously covered with\nwhite paper to render her wares the more inviting, her mother gave her\na long lecture on the trials and difficulties in her path, and the\nproper way to encounter them.\n\n\"Now, my dear child,\" said Mrs. Redburn, in conclusion \"if any evil\nperson insults you, do not resent it, but run away as fast as you can.\"\n\n\"Shan't I say anything, mother?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"But if some naughty boy or girl, no bigger than I am myself, should be\nsaucy to me, I think I can give them as good as they send.\"\n\n\"Don't do it, Katy.\"\n\n\"They have no business to insult me.\"\n\n\"That is very true; but when you use bad or violent language to them,\nyou go down to their level.\"\n\n\"But if they begin it?\"\n\n\"No matter, Katy; if they are unkind and wicked, it is no reason that\nyou should be unkind and wicked. If you leave them without resenting\ntheir insults, the chances are that they will be ashamed of themselves\nbefore you get out of sight. You need not be low and vile because\nothers are.\"\n\n\"I guess you are right, mother.\"\n\n\"You know what the Bible says: 'If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he\nthirst, give him drink, for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire\non his head.'\"\n\n\"I won't say a word, mother, whatever they say to me. I'll be as meek\nas Moses.\"\n\n\"I hope you will not be gone long,\" added Mrs. Redburn.\n\n\"I have thirty sticks of candy here. I don't think it will take me long\nto sell the whole of them. I shall be back by dinner time whether I\nsell them or not for you know I must go to Mrs. Gordon again to-day.\nNow, good-by, mother, and don't you worry about me, for I will do\neverything just as though you were looking at me.\"\n\nKaty closed the door behind her, and did not see the great tears that\nslid down her mother's pale cheek as she departed. It was well she did\nnot, for it would have made her heart very sad to know all the sorrow\nand anxiety that distressed her mother as she saw her going out into\nthe crowded streets of a great city, to expose herself to a thousand\ntemptations. She wept long and bitterly in the solitude of her chamber,\nand perhaps her wounded pride caused many of her tears to flow. But\nbetter thoughts came at last, and she took up the Bible which lay on\nthe bed, and read a few passages. Then she prayed to God that he would\nbe with Katy in the midst of the crowd, and guide her safely through\nthe perils and temptations that would assail her. She tried to banish\nher foolish pride, when she considered her circumstances, she could\nalmost believe it was a wicked pride; but when she endeavored to be\nreconciled to her lot, the thought of her father's fine house, and the\nservants that used to wait upon her, came up, and the struggle in her\nheart was very severe. In spite of all she had said to Katy about the\ndisgrace of selling candy in the streets, she could not but be thankful\nthat the poor girl had none of her foolish pride. She read in the New\nTestament about the lowly life which Jesus and the apostles led, and\nthen asked herself what right she had to be proud. And thus she\nstruggled through the long hours she remained alone--trying to be\nhumble, trying to be good and true. Those who labor and struggle as\nhard as she did are always the better for it, even though they do not\nachieve a perfect triumph over the passions that torment them.\n\nKaty blushed when she met the keeper of the grocery at the corner of\nthe court, for in spite of all her fine talk about false pride, she had\nnot entirely banished it from her heart. Some queer ideas came into her\nhead as she thought what she was doing. What would her grandfather, the\nrich Liverpool merchant, say, should he meet her then? Of course he\nwould not know her; he would be ashamed of her. But she did not permit\nsuch reflections as these to influence her; and as soon as she was\nconscious of the nature of her thoughts she banished them.\n\n\"I'm going to support my mother, and I have no right to be proud. If I\nmeet my grandfather, I should like to sell him twenty sticks of candy.\"\n\n\"Hallo, Katy! What are you going to do?\" said a voice behind, which she\nrecognized as that of her friend Tommy Howard.\n\n\"I'm going to sell this candy,\" replied Katy.\n\n\"You're a spunky one; mother told me all about it. I should like two\nsticks,\" said Tommy, as he offered her the money.\n\n\"Take two, Tommy, and as many more as you like.\"\n\n\"Two is all I want;\" and he placed the two cents on the tray.\n\n\"No, Tommy, I won't take your money,\" replied Katy, with a blush, for\nshe felt ashamed to take his money.\n\n\"That's no way to trade,\" laughed Tommy. \"You won't make much, it you\ndo so. Keep the money and I will keep the candy.\"\n\n\"I can't keep it, Tommy.\"\n\n\"You must; if you don't take the money, I won't take the candy.\"\n\n\"I owe you two cents, Tommy. I will pay you now.\"\n\n\"No, you don't!\"\n\n\"Please to take them; I shall feel very bad, if you don't.\"\n\nTommy Howard looked her in the eye a moment; he saw a tear there. Her\npride was wounded, and he took the two cents from the tray, for he did\nnot wish to give her pain.\n\n\"Now, we are square, Tommy,\" said Katy, as her face brightened up again.\n\n\"Yes, we are, but I don't like it pretty well. One of these days, when\nyou get out of this scrape, I will let you give me as much candy as you\nhave a mind to.\"\n\nThis was very obliging of Tommy; and when Katy understood his motive,\nshe was sorry she had not permitted him to pay for the candy, for she\nsaw that he did not feel just right about the transaction. It was not\nexactly mercantile, but then the heart comes before commerce. As she\nwalked along, she could not help thinking that her natural generosity\nmight seriously interfere with the profits of her enterprise. She had a\ngreat many friends; and it became a knotty question for her to decide\nwhether, if she met any of her school companions, she should give each\nof them a stick of candy. She would like to do so very much indeed; but\nit was certain she could not afford to pursue such a liberal policy. It\nwas a hard question, and, hoping she should not meet any of her\nschoolmates, she determined to refer it to her mother for settlement.\n\nWhen she got into Washington Street, she felt that the time for action\nhad come. Now was the time to sell candy; and yet she did not feel like\nasking folks to buy her wares. The night before, as she lay thinking\nabout her business, it had all seemed very easy to her; but now it was\nquite a different thing. No one seemed to take any notice of her, or to\nfeel the least interest in the great mission she had undertaken. But\nKaty was aware that it requires some effort in these days to sell\ngoods, and she must work; she must ask people to buy her candy.\n\nThere was a nice-looking gentleman, with a good-natured face, coming\ndown the street, and she resolved to make a beginning with him. He\ncouldn't say much more than no to her, and she placed herself in a\nposition to accost him. But when he came near enough, her courage all\noozed out, and she let him pass without speaking to him.\n\n\"What a fool I am!\" exclaimed she to herself when he had passed. \"I\nshall never do anything in this way. There comes another gentleman who\nlooks as though he had a sweet tooth; at any rate, he seems as\ngood-natured as a pound of sugar. I will certainly try him.\"\n\nHer heart pounded against her ribs as though it had been worked by a\nforty-horse engine--poor girl. It was a great undertaking to her; quite\nas great as taking a six-story granite warehouse, piling it full of\nmerchandise from cellar to attic, and announcing himself as ready for\nbusiness, to a child of a larger growth. Everything seemed to hang on\nthe issues of that tremendous moment.\n\n\"Buy some candy?\" said she, in tremulous tones, her great, swelling\nheart almost choking her utterance.\n\n\"No, child. I don't want any,\" replied the gentleman, kindly, as he\nglanced at the tray on which the candy had been so invitingly spread.\n\n\"It is very nice,\" stammered Katy; \"and perhaps your children at home\nwould like some, if you do not.\"\n\nBravo, Katy! That was very well done, though the gentleman was an old\nbachelor, and could not appreciate the full force of your argument.\n\n\"Are you sure it is very nice?\" asked the gentleman, with a benevolent\nsmile, when he had laughed heartily at Katy's jumping conclusion.\n\n\"I know it is,\" replied the little candy merchant, very positively.\n\n\"Then you may give me six sticks;\" and he threw a fourpence on her tray.\n\nSix sticks! Katy was astonished at the magnitude of her first\ncommercial transaction. Visions of wealth, a fine house, and silk\ndresses for her mother and herself, danced through her excited brain,\nand she thought that her grandfather, the great Liverpool merchant,\nwould not have been ashamed of her if he had been present to witness\nthat magnificent operation.\n\n\"Have you any paper to wrap it up in?\" asked the gentleman.\n\nHere was an emergency for which Katy had not provided. Her grandest\nexpectations had not extended beyond the sale of one stick at a time,\nand she was not prepared for such a rush of trade. However, she tore\noff a piece from one of the white sheets at the bottom of the tray,\nwrapped up the six sticks as nicely as she could, and handed them to\nthe gentleman, who then left her to find another customer.\n\nKaty, elated by her first success, ran home as fast as she could to\nprocure some more white paper, of which she had a dozen sheets that had\nbeen given her by a friend. It was in the back room, so that she did\nnot disturb her mother, choosing to astonish her with the whole story\nof her success at noon.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nKATY SELLS OUT AND VISITS THE MAYOR.\n\nKaty reached Washington Street once more. She had lost all her\ntimidity, and would not have feared to accost the governor, if she had\nmet him, and request him to purchase a cent's worth of molasses candy.\n\n\"Buy some candy?\" said she to the first person who passed near her.\n\n\"No!\" was the prompt and emphatic answer of the gentleman addressed.\n\n\"It is very nice,\" suggested Katy.\n\n\"Get out of my may,\" growled the gentleman, and the little candy\nmerchant deemed it prudent to heed the command.\n\nShe was nettled by this rude reception, and would have been disposed to\nresent it, if there had been any way for her to do so. She had not yet\nlearned to bear up against the misfortunes of trade, and her eye\nfollowed the sour gentleman far down the street. Why should he treat\nher in such a rude and unkind manner? What would he say if she should\ntell him that her grandfather was a great Liverpool merchant, lived in\na big house, and had lots of servants to wait upon him? She was as good\nas he was, any day.\n\n\"Give me a stick of candy,\" said a nice little girl with a silk dress\non, whom a lady was holding by the hand, at the same time placing a\ncent on her tray.\n\nKaty started at the words, and reproved herself for her want of\nmeekness. She might, perhaps, have sold half a dozen sticks of candy\nwhile she had been watching the sour gentleman, and persuading herself\nthat she had been very badly used. She tore off a piece of paper, in\nwhich she wrapped up the candy for the purchaser, and handed it to her.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said she, as she picked up the copper, and transferred it\nto her pocket.\n\n\"Your candy looks very nice,\" added the lady evidently pleased with\nKaty's polite manners.\n\n\"It is very nice, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Have you sold much to-day?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am; I have but just come out.\"\n\n\"It looks so good, I will take half a dozen sticks for the children at\nhome.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am; you are very kind,\" replied Katy; and her nimble\nfingers had soon made a nice little parcel for the lady, who gave her a\nfourpence.\n\nHere was another avalanche of good fortune, and the little candy\nmerchant could hardly believe her senses. At this rate she would soon\nbecome a wholesale dealer in the article.\n\n\"Buy some candy?\" said she, addressing the next person she met.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Buy some candy?\" she continued, turning to the next.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnd so she went from one to another, and no one seemed to have the\nleast relish for molasses candy. She walked till she came to State\nStreet, and sold only three sticks. She begun to be a little\ndisheartened, for the success she had met with at the beginning had\nraised her anticipations so high that she was not disposed to be\ncontent with moderate sales. While she was standing at the corner of\nState Street, waiting impatiently for customers, she saw a man with a\nbasket of apples enter a store. She crossed the street to observe what\nhe did in the store, in order, if possible, to get an idea of his mode\nof doing business. She saw him offer his apples to the clerks and\nothers in the shop, and she was surprised and gratified to see that\nnearly every person purchased one or more of them. In her heart she\nthanked the apple man for the hint he had unconsciously afforded her,\nand resolved to profit by his example.\n\nNow that commerce was her business, she was disposed to make it her\nstudy; and as she reasoned over the matter, she came to understand why\nshe found so few buyers in the streets. Ladies and gentlemen did not\nlike to be seen eating candy in the street, neither would many of them\nwant to put it into their pockets, where it would melt and stick to\ntheir clothes. They would eat it in their shops and houses; and with\nthis new idea she was encouraged to make a new effort. Walking along\ntill she came to a store where there appeared to be several clerks she\nentered.\n\n\"Buy some candy?\" she said, addressing a salesman near the window, as\nshe raised up her ware so that he could see them.\n\nThe clerk made no reply, but coming round from behind the counter, he\nrudely took her arm, opened the door, and pushed her into the street.\nKaty's cheek burned with indignation at this unprovoked assault, and\nshe wished for the power of ten men, that she might punish the\nill-natured fellow as he deserved. But it was all for the best, for, in\npushing her out of the shop, the clerk threw her against a portly\ngentleman on the street, whose soft, yielding form alone saved her from\nbeing tumbled into the gutter. He showed no disposition to resent the\nassault upon his obesity, and kindly caught her in his arms.\n\n\"What is the matter my dear?\" said the gentleman, in soothing tones.\n\n\"That man pushed me out of the store,\" replied Katy, bursting into\ntears, for she was completely overcome by the indignity that had been\ncast upon her.\n\n\"Perhaps you didn't behave well.\"\n\n\"I am sure I did. I only asked him to buy some candy: and he shoved me\nright out the door, just as though I had been a dog.\"\n\n\"Well, well, don't cry, my dear; you seem to be a very well-behaved\nlittle girl, and I wonder at finding you in such low business.\"\n\n\"My mother is sick, and I am trying to earn  something to support her,\"\nsobbed Katy, who, with her independent notions of trade in general, and\nof the candy trade in particular, would not have revealed this\nhumiliating truth, except under the severe pressure of a wounded spirit.\n\n\"Poor child!\" exclaimed the portly gentleman, thrusting his hand deep\ndown into his pocket, and pulling up a handful of silver. \"Here is half\na dollar for you, for I know you tell the truth.\"\n\n\"O, no, sir; I can't take money as a gift.\"\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\nThe gentleman looked astonished, and attempted to persuade her; but she\nsteadily protested against receiving his money as a gift.\n\n\"You are a proud little girl, my dear.\"\n\n\"I am poor and proud; but I will sell you some candy.\"\n\n\"Well, give me half a dollar's worth.\"\n\n\"I haven't got so much. I have only fourteen cents' worth left.\"\n\n\"Give me that, then.\"\n\nKaty wrapped up the remainder of her stock in a piece of paper, and\nhanded it to the gentleman, who in payment threw the half-dollar on the\ntray.\n\n\"I can't change it.\"\n\n\"Never mind the change;\" and the fat gentleman hurried away.\n\nKaty was so utterly astounded to find she had disposed of her entire\nstock, that she did not have the presence of mind to follow him, and\nthe half dollar had to be placed in her treasury. She did not regard it\nwith so much pride and pleasure as she did the two four-pence, and the\nfour coppers, for there was something unmercantile about the manner in\nwhich it had come into her possession. She could not feel satisfied\nwith herself, as she walked towards home, till she had argued the\nmatter, and effected a compromise between her pride and her poverty.\nShe had sold candy for the money, and the gentleman had paid her over\nthree cents a stick--rather above the market value of the article; but\nthere was no other way to make the transaction correspond with her\nideas of propriety.\n\nHer work was done for the forenoon, though she had plenty of candy at\nhome. It was now eleven o'clock, and she had not time to sell out\nanother stock before dinner. As she walked up the street, on her way\nhome, she encountered Master Simon Sneed, who, with the dignity and\nstateliness of a merchant prince, was lugging a huge bundle of goods to\nthe residence of some customer.\n\n\"I am glad to see you, Simon,\" said Katy. \"Have you seen your friend\nthe mayor?\"\n\n\"I am sorry to inform you, Katy, that a press of business has prevented\nmy calling on his honor.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for that. I am afraid I shall never see the watch again.\"\n\n\"Depend upon it, you shall. I pledge you my honor that I will use every\nexertion to recover the lost treasure. Just now our firm require the\nundivided attention of all in the store.\"\n\n\"I told Mrs. Gordon all about it, and she promised to speak to the\nmayor.\"\n\n\"It was unnecessary to trouble her with the matter; my influence with\nthe mayor will be quite sufficient.\"\n\n\"I dare say it will; but when shall you see him?\"\n\n\"Very soon, be patient, Katy.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Gordon promised to take me to the mayor to-day, and tell him all\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Take you to the mayor!\" exclaimed Master simon.\n\n\"That's what she said.\"\n\n\"You will be afraid of him, and not able to tell your story.\"\n\n\"No, I guess I shan't. I will tell him that I have mentioned the matter\nto you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you had better not; his honor, though we have been quite\nintimate, may not remember my name. But I must leave you now, for the\nfirm gets very uneasy in my absence.\"\n\nSimon shouldered his bundle again, and moved off, and Katy walked\ntowards home, wondering why a person of so much importance to the\nMessrs. Sands & Co. should be permitted to degrade himself by carrying\nbundles. When she got home, she found her mother in a very cheerful\nframe of mind, the result of her reading and meditation.\n\n\"Well. Katy, you come back with an empty tray have you sold all your\ncandy?\" asked Mrs. Redburn, as she entered the room.\n\n\"Yes, mother, every stick. I have brought back sixty-six cents,\"\nreplied Katy, emptying her pocket on the bed.\n\n\"Sixty-six cents! But you had only thirty sticks of candy.\"\n\n\"You must not blame me for what I have done, mother; I could not help\nit;\" and she proceeded to narrate all the particulars of her forenoon's\noccupation.\n\nMrs. Redburn was annoyed at the incident with the fat gentleman; more\nso than by the rudeness to which Katy had been subjected. The little\nmerchant was so elated at her success, that her mother could not find\nit in her heart to cast a damper upon her spirits by a single reproach.\nPerhaps her morning's reflections had subdued her pride so that she did\nnot feel disposed to do so.\n\nAfter dinner Katy hastened at once to Temple Street again. To her great\ndisappointment she found that Mrs. Gordon and her daughter had been\nsuddenly called to Baltimore by the death of one of her husband's near\nrelatives. But the kind lady had not forgotten her, and that was a\ngreat consolation. Michael gave her a note, directed to the mayor,\nwhich he instructed her to deliver that day.\n\nWith the assistance of Michael, she found the house of the mayor, and\nthough her heart beat violently she resolutely rang the bell at the\ndoor.\n\n\"Is the mayor in?\" asked she of the sleek servant man that answered the\nsummons.\n\n\"Well, suppose he is; what of it?\" replied the servant, who could not\npossibly have been aware that Katy's grandfather was a rich Liverpool\nmerchant, or he would have spoken more civilly to her.\n\n\"I want to see him.\"\n\n\"He don't see little brats like you,\" answered the servant, shutting\nthe door in her face.\n\nKaty was indignant. She wished a dozen things all at once; and among\nother things she wished Master Simon Sneed had been there, that he\nmight report the circumstance to his friend the mayor. What was to be\ndone? It was mean to treat her in that shabby manner, and she would not\nstand it? She would not, that she wouldn't! Grasping the bell handle\nwith a courageous hand, she gave a pull that must have astonished the\noccupants of the servants' hall, and led them to believe that some\ndistinguished character had certainly come. The sleek man servant\nreappeared at the door, ready to make his lowest bow to the great\npersonage, when he beheld the flashing eye of Katy.\n\n\"How dare you ring that bell again?\" snarled he.\n\n\"I want to see the mayor, I have a note for him from Mrs. Gordon, and I\nwon't go away till I see him.\"\n\n\"From Mrs. Gordon! Why didn't you say so? You may come in.\"\n\nKaty entered at this invitation, and the man bade her wait in the hall\ntill he informed the mayor of her errand. She was not a little pleased\nwith the victory she had gained, and felt quite equal, after it, to the\nfeat of facing the chief magistrate of the city. While she stood there,\na little boy having in his hand a stick of molasses candy, with which\nhe had contrived plentifully to bedaub his face, came out of the\nadjoining room, and surveyed her carefully from head to foot. Katy\nlooked at the candy with attention, for it looked just like one of the\nsticks she had sold that forenoon. The little fellow who was not more\nthan five or six years of age, seemed to have a hearty relish for the\narticle, and as he turned it over, Katy assured herself that it was a\nportion of her stock.\n\n\"My pa brought home lots of candy,\" said the little fellow, after he\nhad satisfied himself with the survey of Katy's person.\n\n\"Do you like it?\" asked she, willing to cultivate his acquaintance.\n\n\"Don't I, though!\"\n\n\"Where did your father get it?\"\n\n\"He bought it of a little girl; she was poor and proud,\" replied the\nlittle gentleman, transferring half an inch of the candy to his mouth.\n\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Katy.\n\nBut her conversation was interrupted by the return of the servant, who\ndirected Katy to follow him up-stairs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nKATY TALKS WITH THE MAYOR, AND RECOVERS THE WATCH.\n\nKaty followed the servant man, whose name was John, up-stairs; but at\nthe first turn he stopped, and begged her not to mention that he had\nshut the door upon her.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Katy. \"I gave you no reason to treat me in that\nugly manner.\"\n\n\"You didn't, but, you see, I thought you was some beggar, coming to\ndisturb his honor.\"\n\n\"Do I look like a beggar?\" asked Katy.\n\n\"Indeed you don't; that was a bad blunder of mine. If you mention it, I\nshall lose my place.\"\n\n\"Well, I won't say a word then; but I hope you will learn better\nmanners next time.\"\n\n\"Thank you, miss; and be sure I'll treat you like a lady next time.\"\n\nJohn then conducted her up-stairs into a room the walls of which were\nalmost covered with books. Katy thought what a wise man the mayor must\nbe, for she had never seen so many books before in her life, and took\nit for granted the mayor had read them all. As she entered the\napartment she saw a fat gentleman sitting at the desk, very busy\nexamining a great pile of papers. When he turned his head, Katy was not\nmuch surprised to see that it was the nice gentleman who had given her\nhalf a dollar for fourteen cents' worth of candy.\n\n\"Ah, my dear, is it you!\" exclaimed the mayor, as he recognized the\nlittle candy merchant.\n\n\"Yes, sir; if you please, it is me,\" stammered Katy, making her\nobeisance, and feeling very mush confused, for it was the first time\nshe had ever come into the presence of a great man, and she could not\nexactly tell whether she ought to get down on her knees, as she had\nread that people did when they approached a king, or to remain standing.\n\n\"Well my dear, what is your name?\" continued the mayor.\n\n\"Katy Redburn, if you please, sir,\" replied Katy with another courtesy.\n\n\"I am glad you have come to me with this business, Katy. Mrs. Gordon\nspeaks very handsomely of you.\"\n\n\"She is very kind, sir.\"\n\n\"You have lost your watch--have you, Katy?\"\n\n\"My father's watch, if you please, sir,\" and having gained a little\nconfidence from the kind tones of the mayor, she proceeded to tell him\nthe whole story of her adventure in the pawnbroker's shop.\n\nThe mayor listened attentively to the artless recital, and promised to\ndo all in his power to regain the watch.\n\n\"Were you alone, Katy, when you went to the pawnbroker's?\"\n\n\"No, sir; there was one of your friends with me,\" replied she with a\nsimple smile.\n\n\"One of my friends?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; and he promised to see you about it.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you have been imposed upon, Katy.\"\n\n\"No, sir; he has often spoken to me about his friend the mayor.\"\n\n\"But who was he?\"\n\n\"Master Simon Sneed.\"\n\n\"Sneed? Sneed?\" mused the mayor.\n\n\"Yes, sir; Master Simon Sneed.\"\n\n\"Master? What is he? A schoolmaster?\"\n\n\"O, no, sir. Everybody calls him master. He keeps store.\"\n\n\"Sneed? I never heard the name before. Where is his store?\"\n\n\"In Washington Street. It says Sands & Co. on the sign.\"\n\n\"O, you mean the boy that makes the fires, sweeps out, and does the\nerrands. I remember him now,\" said the mayor, laughing heartily at poor\nKaty's account of Simon. \"I never heard his name before; but he is the\noldest boy of his age I ever saw.\"\n\n\"He was very kind to me.\"\n\n\"No doubt he is a very good boy; but I supposed from your account of\nhim that he was a member of the firm.\"\n\n\"Master Simon says the firm would not be able to get along without\nhim,\" replied Katy, who began to have some doubts whether Simon was so\ngreat a man as he had represented himself to be.\n\n\"Master Simon is very kind to stay with them then, and I hope the\nMessrs. Sands will properly appreciate his merit. Now, Katy,\" continued\nthe mayor, who had been writing while he questioned his visitor, \"you\nmay take this note to the City Hall and deliver it to the city marshal,\nhe will do all he can to recover your lost treasure.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" replied Katy, as she took the note.\n\n\"Now, good-by, Katy, and I hope you will always be as good as your\ncandy is.\"\n\n\"I will try; good-by, sir;\" and she left the library and passed\ndown-stairs.\n\nJohn let her out very civilly and seemed very grateful to her that she\nhad not exposed his rudeness. She hastened to the City Hall, sure\nalmost of recovering the watch, and gladdening her mother with the\nsight of it on her return home.\n\nSimon Sneed, after parting with Katy, had felt a little uneasy in\nrelation to the watch. He was jealous of his own good credit, for he\nforesaw that Katy could not very well avoid telling the mayor that he\nhad been with her at the time of the unfortunate transaction. Besides,\nhe did not exactly like the idea of Katy's going to the mayor at all.\nKaty Redburn going to see the mayor! By and by everybody would know his\nhonor, and there would be no glory in being acquainted with him!\n\nHis conscience seemed to reprove him because he had done nothing\ntowards the recovery of the watch. What would his friend the mayor say\nif Katy should happen to tell him of his neglect?\n\n\"Here I am,\" said Master Simon to himself, as he entered the store, \"a\nperson of influence, enjoying the friendship of the chief magistrate of\nthe city and have not exerted my influence, or used my powerful friend,\nto redress the injury which this poor girl has received. I will correct\nmy error at once, for if the mayor should happen to invite me to dinner\nsome time, very likely he would reproach me for my neglect.\"\n\nHaving thus resolved to preserve his credit with the chief magistrate\nof the city, there was fortunately a lull in the waves of the Messrs.\nSand & Co.'s affairs which enabled him to be absented for half an hour\nwithout serious injury to their business. He hastened to the\npawnbroker's at which the robbery had been committed.\n\n\"I presume you know me, sir?\" said Simon.\n\n\"I haven't that honor,\" replied the broker.\n\n\"Perhaps you may be able to recall the circumstance of a little girl\npresenting herself here with a silver watch.\"\n\n\"Well, I do.\"\n\n\"I was with her.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose you helped her steal it.\"\n\n\"Such an insinuation, sir, is unworthy a gentleman, I have come, sir,\nwith a benevolent purpose, as I came before. In half an hour the\nhistory of that transaction will be conveyed to the mayor who, allow me\nto inform you, is my friend.\"\n\n\"Your friend!\" sneered the broker who was not particularly impressed by\nthe magnificent manners and the magnificent speech of Master Simon.\n\n\"The little girl has just gone with a note from Mrs. Gordon of Temple\nStreet to seek redress of the mayor. I doubt not you will be prosecuted\nat once. You have an opportunity to save yourself.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, you young puppy?\" said the broker, angrily.\n\"Do you mean to say I stole the watch?\"\n\n\"By no means; only that you took what did not belong to you,\" replied\nMaster Simon, blandly.\n\n\"Get out of my shop!\"\n\n\"Understand me, sir; I come as your friend.\"\n\n\"You are a fool, I believe.\"\n\n\"You have an undoubted right to your opinion, as I have to mine; but if\nyou do not restore the watch within half an hour, you will be arrested\nfor stealing--I beg your pardon, for taking what did not belong to you.\"\n\nThere was something in the earnest manner of Simon which arrested the\nattention of the broker, in spite of the former's high-flown speech. He\nwas satisfied that something had been done, and he was disposed to\navoid any unpleasant consequences.\n\n\"I spoke to a policeman about the watch,\" said the man. \"I told him I\nhad it, and if he found that such a watch had been stolen, it could be\nfound at my shop.\"\n\n\"And if he did not find that watch had been stolen, you meant to keep\nit yourself,\" answered Master Simon, whose earnestness made him forget\nfor a moment to use his high-flown words.\n\n\"Keep a civil tongue in your head,\" growled the broker. \"I notified the\npolice that I had it; that's enough.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is I will ask my friend the mayor about it;\" and Simon\nmoved towards the door.\n\n\"Stop a moment.\"\n\n\"Can't stop now.\"\n\n\"Here! I will go up to the city marshal with you. May be I made a\nmistake in keeping the watch; but if I did, it was only to prevent it\nfrom falling into the hands of some one less scrupulous than myself.\"\n\n\"Do I look like a thief?\" asked Master Simon, indignantly.\n\n\"It don't do to judge by appearances,\" replied the broker, locking his\nshop door, and walking towards the City Hall with Simon. \"There are\nsome very respectable thieves about.\"\n\nMaster Simon Sneed was satisfied with this explanation. He did not care\nto quarrel with any one who acknowledged his respectability. In a few\nmoments they reached the City Hall, and ascended the stone steps to the\nvestibule. As they did so, Katy entered from the opposite door.\n\n\"How glad I am to find you, Master Simon!\" exclaimed she. \"Can you tell\nme where the city marshal's office is?\"\n\n\"Here it is, Katy,\" replied Simon, pointing to the door. \"But what are\nyou going to do?\"\n\n\"I have got a note for the city marshal. The mayor gave it to me.\"\n\n\"You hear that, sir,\" said Master Simon to the broker, with becoming\ndignity. \"This, Katy, is the man that has your silver watch; and he has\nconsented to deliver it to the rightful owner.\"\n\n\"Let me see the note,\" said the broker.\n\n\"No, I won't,\" replied Katy, pretty sharply. \"You are a naughty man,\nand I won't trust you with it.\"\n\n\"But I will give you, the watch.\"\n\n\"Give it to me, and then I will show you the note,\" replied Katy, who\nwas thinking more of getting the precious relic than of having the\nbroker punished.\n\nThe broker took the watch from his pocket and handed it to her, and in\nreturn she produced the mayor's note.\n\n\"I suppose there is no need of your delivering this note now?\"\ncontinued the broker, with a cunning smile.\n\n\"No; I don't care anything about it, now that I have got the watch,\"\nreplied Katy, rejoiced beyond measure to recover the treasure.\n\n\"Well, then, I am somewhat acquainted with the marshal, and I will hand\nhim the note, and explain the circumstances. He will be perfectly\nsatisfied.\"\n\nKaty didn't care whether he was satisfied or not, so long as she had\nthe watch. But the broker entered the marshal's office, and they could\nnot see him put the note in his pocket.\n\n\"I am so glad I got it!\" exclaimed Katy.\n\n\"I doubt whether you could have recovered it if I had not used my\ninfluence in your favor,\" remarked Simon, complacently. \"I went to his\noffice, and assured him my friend the mayor had already taken the\nmatter in hand. I talked pretty severely to him, and he got frightened.\nAfter all, the best way is to use very pointed language to these\nfellows.\"\n\n\"I thank you very much, Master Simon, and I hope I shall be able to do\nsomething for you some time.\"\n\nBut Messrs. Sands & Co.'s affairs were suffering, perhaps, and Simon\nhastened back to the store, and Katy ran home to cheer her mother with\nthe sight of the recovered relic.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nKATY, IN DISTRESS, FINDS A CHAMPION.\n\nNow that she had recovered the precious watch Katy had nothing to\nengage her attention but the business of selling candy. The success\nthat had attended her forenoon's exertions was gratifying beyond her\nexpectations, and she felt as though she had already solved the\nproblem; that she was not only willing but able to support her mother.\nShe had originated a great idea, and she was proud of it.\n\nJust as soon, therefore, as she had told her mother all about the\nrecovery of the watch, she prepared another tray of candy, resolved to\nsell the whole of it before she returned. Her mother tried to induce\nher to stay in the house and rest herself, but her impatience to\nrealize the fruits of her grand idea would not permit her to remain\ninactive a single hour.\n\n\"Now, mother, I shall sell all this candy before dark; so don't be\nuneasy about me. I am going to make lots of money, and you shall have\neverything you want in a few weeks,\" said Katy, as she put on her\nbonnet.\n\n\"I wish you would stay at home, and rest yourself; you have done enough\nfor one day.\"\n\n\"I am not tired a bit, mother; I feel just as if I could walk a hundred\nmiles.\"\n\n\"That's because you have got a new notion in your head. I am afraid you\nwill be sick, and then what should we do?\"\n\n\"O, I shan't get sick; I promise you I won't,\" replied Katy, as she\nleft the room.\n\nUnfortunately for the little candy merchant it was Wednesday afternoon,\nand as the schools did not keep, there were a great many boys in the\nstreet, and many of them were very rude, naughty boys. When she passed\nup the court, some of them called out to her, and asked her where she\nwas going with all that candy. She took no notice of them, for they\nspoke very rudely, and were no friends of hers. Among them was Johnny\nGrippen, whose acquaintance the reader made on the pier of South Boston\nbridge. This young ruffian led half a dozen others down the court in\npursuit of her, for possibly they were not satisfied with the cavalier\nmanner in which Katy had treated them.\n\n\"Where are you going with all that candy?\" repeated the juvenile bully,\nwhen he overtook her in Essex Street.\n\n\"I am going to sell it,\" replied Katy, finding she could not escape.\n\n\"Give us a junk, will you?\" said Johnny.\n\n\"I can't give it away; I am going to sell it, to get money for my\nmother.\"\n\n\"Won't you give a feller a piece?\"\n\n\"I can't now; perhaps I'll give you some another time.\"\n\nKaty's heart beat violently, for she was very much alarmed, knowing\nthat Johnny had not followed her for nothing. As she made her firm but\nconciliatory reply, she moved on, hoping they would not attempt to\nannoy her. It was a vain hope, for Johnny kept close to her side, his\neyes fixed wistfully on the tempting array of sweets she carried.\n\n\"Come, don't be stingy, Katy,\" continued Johnny.\n\n\"I don't mean to be; but I don't think I owe you anything,\" replied\nKaty, gathering courage in her desperate situation.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\" demanded the little ruffian, as he placed\nhimself in front of her, and thus prevented her further progress.\n\n\"Don't stop me; I'm in a hurry,\" said Katy.\n\n\"Gi' me some candy, then.\"\n\n\"No, I won't!\" answered Katy, losing her patience.\n\n\"Won't you?\"\n\nJohnny made a dive at the tray, with the intention of securing a\nportion of the candy; but Katy adroitly dodged the movement, and\nturning up a narrow alley way, ran off. Johnny was not to be balked,\nand followed her; and then she found she had made a bad mistake in\ngetting off the street, where there were no passers-by to interfere in\nher favor.\n\n\"Johnny!\" shouted one of the bully's companions. \"Johnny, Tom Howard is\ncoming.\"\n\n\"Let him come!\" replied Johnny, doggedly.\n\nHe did not half like the insinuation conveyed in the words of his\nassociates; for to tell him, under the circumstances, that Tommy was\ncoming, was as much as to say he was afraid of him. Now, as we have\nsaid, Johnny Grippen was a \"fighting character,\" and had a reputation\nto maintain. He gloried in the name of being able to whip any boy of\nhis size in the neighborhood. He was always ready to fight, and had,\nperhaps, given some hard knocks in his time; but he sustained his\ncharacter rather by his talent for bullying, than by any conquests he\nhad won. On the whole he was a miserable, contemptible little bruiser\nwhom no decent boy could love or respect. He talked so big about \"black\neyes,\" \"bloody noses\" and \"smashed heads,\" that few boys cared to\ndispute his title to the honors he had assumed. Probably some who felt\nable to contest the palm with him, did not care to dirty their fingers\nupon the bullying cub.\n\nSensible people, whether men or boys, invariably despise the \"fighting\ncharacter,\" be he young or old. Nine times out of ten he is both a\nknave and a fool, a coward and a bully.\n\nOn the other hand, Tommy Howard was one of those hearty, whole-souled\nboys, who are the real lions of the playground. He was not a \"fighting\ncharacter;\" and being a sensible boy, he had a hearty contempt for\nJohnny Grippen. He was not afraid of him, and though he never went an\ninch out of his way to avoid a fight with him, it so happened they had\nnever fought. He was entirely indifferent to his threats, and had no\ngreat opinion of his courage. Johnny had \"stumped\" him to fight, and\neven taken off his coat and dared him to come; but Tommy would laugh at\nhim, tell him to put on his coat or he would catch cold; and, contrary\nto the general opinion among boys, no one ever thought the less of him\nfor the true courage he exhibited on these occasions.\n\nJohnny did not like to be told that Tommy was coming, for it reminded\nhim that, as the king bully of the neighborhood, one of his subjects\nwas unconquered and rebellious. But Johnny had discretion--and bullies\ngenerally have it. He did not like that cool, independent way of the\nrefractory vassal; it warned him to be cautious.\n\n\"What's the matter, Katy?\" asked Tommy, as he came with quick pace up\nthe court, without deigning to cast even a glance at the ruffian who\nmenaced her.\n\n\"Stand by, fellers, and see fair play, and I'll lick him now,\" said\nJohnny, in a low tone, to his companions.\n\n\"He won't let me go,\" replied Katy, pointing to her assailant.\n\n\"Go ahead, Katy; don't mind him.\"\n\n\"Won't you give me some candy?\" said Johnny, stepping up before her\nagain.\n\n\"Go ahead, Katy,\" repeated Tommy, placing himself between her and the\nbully. \"Don't mind him, Katy.\"\n\nAs she advanced, Johnny pushed forward, and made another dive at the\ntray, but Katy's champion caught him by the arm and pulled him away.\n\n\"You mind out!\" growled the bully, doubling up his fists, and placing\nhimself in the most approved attitude, in front of the unwhipped vassal.\n\n\"Go ahead, Katy; clear out as fast as you can,\" said Tommy, who, though\nhis bosom swelled with indignation, still preserved his wonted\ncoolness; and it was evident to the excited spectators that he did not\nintend to \"mind out.\"\n\n\"Come on, if you want to fight!\" shouted Johnny, brandishing his fists.\n\n\"I don't want to fight; but you are a mean, dirty blackguard, or you\nwouldn't have treated a girl like that,\" replied Tommy, standing as\nstiff as a stake before the bully.\n\n\"Say that again, and I'll black your eye for you.\"\n\n\"Once is enough, if you heard me; but I will tell your father about it.\"\n\n\"Will you? Just say that again.\"\n\nSomehow, it often happens that bullies want a person to say a thing\nover twice, from which we infer that they must be very deaf or very\nstupid. Tommy would not repeat the offensive remark, and Johnny's\nsupporters began to think he was not half so anxious to fight as he\nseemed, which was certainly true. I have no doubt, if they had been\nalone, he would have found a convenient excuse for retiring from the\nfield, leaving it unsullied by a black eye or a bloody nose.\n\nMy young friends will excuse me from digressing so far as to say that,\nin more than a dozen years with boys, in school and out, I have never\nheard of such a thing as two boys getting up a fight and having it out\nalone. There must be a crowd of bruisers and \"scallewags\" around, to\nkeep up the courage of the combatants. Therefore, those who look on are\njust as bad as those who fight, for without their presence the fight\ncould not be carried through.\n\nTommy Howard had said all he had to say, and was therefore ready to\ndepart. He turned to do so, and walked several steps down the alley,\nthough he kept one eye over his shoulder to guard against accidents.\n\n\"Hit him, Johnny!\" cried one of the  vagabond troops that followed in\nthe train of the bully.\n\n\"He darsen't fight,\" replied Johnny.\n\n\"Nor you, nuther,\" added another of the supporters.\n\nThis was too much for Johnny. It cut him to the quick, and he could not\nstand it. If he did not thrash Tommy now, his reputation would be\nentirely ruined.\n\n\"Darsen't I?\" exclaimed he. \"Come back here;\" but as Tommy did not\ncome, he ran up behind him, and aimed a blow at the side of his head.\n\nKaty's intrepid defender, who had perhaps read in some Fourth of July\noration that \"eternal vigilance is the price of liberty,\" was not to be\nsurprised, and facing about, he warded off the blow. Johnny's imperiled\nreputation rendered him desperate. He had gone too far to recede, and\nhe went into action with all the energy and skill of a true bruiser.\nTommy was now fully roused, and his blows, which were strictly in\nself-defense, fell rapidly and heavily on the head of his assailant.\nBut I am not going to give my young readers the particulars of the\nfight; and I would not have let Tommy engage in such a scene, were it\nnot to show up Johnny as he was, and finish the portrait of him which I\nhad outlined; to show the difference between the noble, generous,\nbrave, and true-hearted boy, and the little bully, whom all my young\nfriends have seen and despised.\n\nIn something less than two minutes, Johnny Grippen, after muttering\n\"foul play,\" backed out with bloody nose, as completely whipped, and as\nthoroughly \"cowed down,\" as though he had been fighting with a royal\nBengal tiger. His supremacy was at an end, and there was danger that\nsome other bold fellow might take it into his head to thrash the donkey\nafter the lion's skin had been stripped from his shoulders.\n\n\"If you are satisfied now, I'll go about my business,\" said Tommy, as\nhe gazed with mingled pity and contempt upon his crest-fallen assailant.\n\n\"You don't fight fair,\" grumbled Johnny, who could not account for his\ndefeat in any other way. \"If you're a mind to fight fair, I'll try it\nagain with you some time.\"\n\n\"I don't fight for the fun of it. I only fight when some cowardly bully\nlike you comes at me, and I can't help myself. When you feel like\nwhipping me again, you needn't stop to let me know it beforehand. But I\nwill tell you this much: if you ever put your hand on Katy Redburn, or\nmeddle with her in any way, I promise to pound you as handsomely as I\nknow how, fair or foul, the very next time I meet you, if it isn't for\nseven years. Just bear that in mind.\"\n\nJohnny made no reply; he was not in a condition to make a reply, and\nthe victor in the conquest departed, leaving the bully to explain his\ndefeat as best he could to his admirers and supporters.\n\n\"He did not hurt you--did he?\" asked Katy, as Tommy joined her at the\nfoot of the alley, where she had been anxiously waiting the result of\nthe encounter.\n\n\"Not a bit, Katy. He talks very loud, but he is a coward. I'm sorry I\nhad to thrash him though I think it will do him good.\"\n\n\"I was afraid he'd hurt you. You were very kind to save me from him,\nTommy. I shall never forget you, as long as I live, and I hope I shall\nbe able to do something for you one of these days.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't mind that, Katy. He is an ugly fellow, and I wouldn't stand\nby and see him insult a girl. But I must go now. I told Johnny if he\never meddled with you again I should give him some; if he does, just\nlet me know.\"\n\n\"I hope he won't again,\" replied Katy, as Tommy moved towards home.\n\nThis was Katy's first day in mercantile life; it had been full of\nincidents, and she feared her path might be a thorny one. But her light\nheart soon triumphed over doubts and fears, and when she reached\nWashington Street, she was as enthusiastic as ever, and as ready for a\ntrade.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nKATY MEETS WITH EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS.\n\n\"Buy some candy?\" said Katy to the first gentleman she met.\n\nHe did not even deign to glance at her; and five or six attempts to\nsell a stick of candy were failures; but when she remembered the\nsuccess that had followed her disappointment in the morning, she did\nnot lose her courage. Finding that people in the street would not buy,\nshe entered a shop where the clerks seemed to be at leisure, though she\ndid not do so without thinking of the rude manner in which she had been\nejected from a store in the forenoon.\n\n\"Buy some candy?\" said she to a good-natured young gentleman, who was\nleaning over his counter waiting for a customer.\n\n\"How do you sell it?\"\n\n\"Cent a stick; it is very nice. I sold fourteen sticks of it to the\nmayor this forenoon. He said it was good.\"\n\n\"You don't say so? Did he give you a testimonial?\"\n\n\"No; he gave me half a dollar.\"\n\nThe clerk laughed heartily at Katy's misapprehension of his word, and\nhis eye twinkled with mischief. It was plain that he was not a great\nadmirer of molasses candy, and that he only wanted to amuse himself at\nKaty's expense.\n\n\"You know what they do with quack medicines--don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do; some folks are fools enough to take them,\" replied Katy,\nsmartly.\n\n\"That's a fact; but you don't understand me. Dr. Swindlehanger, round\nthe corner, would give the mayor a hundred dollars to say his patent\nelixir is good. Now, if you could only get the mayor's name on a paper\nsetting forth the virtues of your candy, I dare say you could sell a\nthousand sticks in a day. Why don't you ask him for such a paper?\"\n\n\"I don't want any paper, except to wrap up my candy in. But you don't\nwant to buy any candy, I see;\" and Katy moved towards some more clerks\nat the other end of the store.\n\n\"Yes, I do; stop a minute. I want to buy six sticks for my children!\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For my grandchildren.\"\n\n\"You are making fun of me,\" said Katy, who could see this, though the\nyoung man was so pleasant and so funny, she could not be offended with\nhim. \"I don't believe your mother would like it, if she should hear you\ntell such a monstrous story.\"\n\nThe young man bit his lip. Perhaps he had a kind mother who had taught\nhim never to tell a lie, even in jest. He quickly recovered his humor,\nhowever, though it was evident that Katy's rebuke had not been without\nits effect.\n\n\"For how much will you sell me six sticks?\" continued the clerk.\n\n\"For six cents.\"\n\n\"But that is the retail price; when you sell goods at wholesale you\nought not to ask so much for them.\"\n\n\"You shall have them for five cents then,\" replied Katy, struck with\nthe force of the suggestion.\n\n\"I can't afford to give so much as that. I am a poor man. I have to go\nto the theater twice a week, and that costs me a dollar. Then a ride\nSunday afternoon costs me three dollars. So you see I don't have much\nmoney to spend upon luxuries.\"\n\n\"I hope you don't go out to ride Sundays,\" said Katy.\n\n\"But I do.\"\n\n\"What does your mother say to it?\"\n\nThe clerk bit his lip again. He did not like these allusions to his\nmother, who perhaps lived far away in the country, and had taught him\nto \"remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy.\" Very likely his\nconscience smote him, as he thought of her and her blessed teachings in\nthe far-off home of his childhood.\n\n\"I will give you two cents,\" said the clerk.\n\n\"I can't take that; it would hardly pay for the molasses, to say\nnothing of firewood and labor.\"\n\n\"Call it three cents, then.\"\n\n\"No, sir; the wholesale price is five cents for six sticks.\"\n\n\"But I am poor.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't be poor if you saved up your money, and kept the Sabbath.\nYour mother----\"\n\n\"There, there! that's enough. I will take a dozen sticks!\" exclaimed\nthe young man, impatiently interrupting her.\n\n\"A dozen?\"\n\n\"Yes, a dozen, and there are twelve cents.\"\n\n\"But I only ask ten.\"\n\n\"No matter, give me the candy, and take the money,\" he replied,\nfearful, it may be, that she would again allude to his mother.\n\nKaty counted out the sticks, wrapped them up in a paper, and put the\nmoney in her pocket. If she had stopped at the door to study the young\nman's face, she might have detected a shadow of uneasiness and anxiety\nupon it. He was a very good-hearted, but rather dissolute, young man,\nand the allusions she had made to his mother burned like fire in his\nheart, for he had neglected her counsels, and wandered from the\nstraight road in which she had taught him to walk. If she could have\nfollowed him home, and into the solitude of his chamber, she could have\nseen him open his desk, and write a long letter to his distant\nmother--a duty he had too long neglected. We may not follow the\nfortunes of this young man, but if we could, we might see how a few\nwords, fitly spoken, even by the lips of an innocent youth; will\nsometimes produce a  powerful impression on the character; will\nsometimes change the whole current of a life, and reach forward to the\nlast day of existence.\n\nKaty, all unconscious of the great work she had done, congratulated\nherself on this success, and wished she might find a few more such\ncustomers. Glancing into the shop windows as she passed along, to\nascertain whether there was a good prospect for her, she soon found an\ninviting field. It was a crockery ware store that she entered this\ntime, and there were several persons there who seemed not to be very\nbusy.\n\n\"Buy some candy?\" said she, presenting the tray to the first person she\nmet.\n\n\"Go home and wash your face,\" was the ill-natured response.\n\nWas it possible she had come out with a dirty face? No; she had washed\nherself the last thing she had done. It is true her clothes were\nshabby, there was many a patch and darn upon her dress, and its colors\nhad faded out like the \"last rose of summer;\" but then the dress was\nclean.\n\n\"Buy some candy?\" said she to another, with a sudden resolution not to\nbe disturbed by the rudeness of those she addressed.\n\nHe took a stick, and threw down a cent, without a word. One more did\nher a similar favor, and she left the store well satisfied with the\nvisit. Pretty soon she came to a large piano-forte manufactory, where\nshe knew that a great many men were employed. She went up-stairs to the\ncounting-room, where she sold three sticks, and was about to enter the\nwork-room, when a sign, \"No admittance except on business,\" confronted\nher. Should she go on? Did the sign refer to her? She had business\nthere, but perhaps they would not be willing to admit that her business\nwas very urgent, and she dreaded the indignity of being turned out\nagain. Her mother had told her there was always a right way and a wrong\nway. It certainly was not right to enter in the face of a positive\nprohibition, and at last she decided to return to the office and ask\npermission to visit the workshop.\n\n\"Please may I go into the workshop?\" said she, addressing the man who\nhad purchased the candy.\n\n\"Go in? why not?\" replied he, placing his pen behind his ear, and\nlooking at her with a smile of curiosity.\n\n\"Why, it says on the door, 'No admittance except on business.'\"\n\n\"So it does. Well, I declare, you have got an amount of conscience\nbeyond your station. No one thinks of taking any notice of that sign.\nPeddlers and apple men go in without a question.\"\n\n\"I thought you wouldn't let people go in.\"\n\n\"We don't like to have visitors there, for they sometimes do injury,\nand generally take off the attention of the men from their work. But\nyou have got so much conscience about the matter, that you shall not\nonly go in, but I will go with you, and introduce you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir; I won't give you all that trouble. I can introduce\nmyself.\"\n\nBut the bookkeeper led the way to the door, and they entered a large\nroom in which a great many men were busily at work.\n\n\"Here is a very honest little girl,\" said her friend, \"who has the very\nbest molasses candy I ever ate. If any of you have a sweet tooth, or\nany children at home, I advise you to patronize her.\"\n\nThe bookkeeper laughed, and the workmen laughed, as they began to feel\nin their pockets for loose change. It was evident that the friendly\nintroduction was to be of great service to her. She passed along from\none man to another, and almost every one of them bought two or three\nsticks of candy, and before she had been to all of them her stock was\nentirely exhausted. Katy was astonished at her good fortune, and the\nmen were all exceedingly good-natured. They seemed disposed to make a\npleasant thing of her visit, and to give her a substantial benefit.\n\n\"Now, my little girl,\" said the bookkeeper, \"when you wish to visit the\nworkshop again, you may enter without further permission; and I am sure\nthe men will all be very glad to see you.\"\n\n\"But I want some of that candy,\" said one of the workmen. \"My little\ngirl would jump to get a stick.\"\n\n\"Then she shall have some,\" replied Katy, \"for I will go home and get\nsome more;\" and she left the building and hastened home for a further\nsupply of the popular merchandise.\n\n\"O mother! I have sold out all my candy, and I want a lot more!\"\nexclaimed she, as she rushed into the room, full of excitement and\nenthusiasm.\n\n\"Be calm, child; you will throw yourself into a fever,\" replied Mrs.\nRedburn. \"You must learn to take things more easily.\"\n\n\"O dear! I have only twenty sticks left. I wish I had a hundred, for I\nam sure I could sell them.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it is fortunate you have no more.\"\n\n\"But I must make some more to-night for to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Don't drive round so, Katy. Be reasonable, and don't think too much of\nyour success.\"\n\nBut Katy could not stop to argue the matter, though, as she walked\nalong the street, she thought of what her mother had said, and tried to\ncalm the excitement that agitated her. It was hard work to keep from\nrunning every step of the way; but her mother's advice must be heeded,\nand to some extent she succeeded in controlling her violent impulses.\nAs it was, she reached the piano-forte manufactory quite out of breath,\nand rushed into the workroom as though she had come on an errand of\nvital importance to its occupants.\n\nIt required but a few minutes to dispose of her small stock of candy.\nThe workmen all hoped she would come again, and she departed highly\nelated at her success.\n\n\"There, mother, I have sold all the candy. What do you think of that?\"\nsaid she, as she entered her mother's room, and threw off her bonnet\nand shawl.\n\n\"You have done very well, I had no idea that you could sell more than\ntwenty or thirty sticks in a day.\"\n\n\"It's a great day's work, mother; and if I can sell half as much in a\nday, I shall be satisfied. Don't you think I shall be able to support\nyou?\"\n\n\"At this rate you can do much more; but, Katy, I tremble for you.\"\n\n\"Why, mother?\"\n\n\"You get so excited, and run so, I am afraid it will make you sick.\"\n\n\"O, no, it won't, mother. I feel as strong as a horse. I am not tired\nin the least.\"\n\n\"You don't feel so now, because you are so excited by your success.\"\n\n\"I shall get used to it in a little while.\"\n\n\"I hope so, if you mean to follow this business.\"\n\n\"If I mean to? Why mother, what else could I do to make so much money?\nSee here;\" and she poured the money she had taken upon the bed-quilt\nbefore her mother. \"One dollar and thirty-six cents, mother! Only think\nof it! But I won't jump so another day; I will take it easy.\"\n\n\"I wish you would.\"\n\n\"I will try very hard; but you can't think how happy I feel! Dear me! I\nam wasting my time, when I have to make the candy for to-morrow.\"\n\n\"But, Katy, you must not do any more to-night. You will certainly be\nsick.\"\n\n\"I must make it, mother.\"\n\n\"Your hands are very sore now.\"\n\n\"They are better; and I don't feel tired a bit.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what you may do, if you must make the candy to-night.\nWhen you have got the molasses boiled, you may ask Mrs. Colvin, the\nwasherwoman, to come in and pull it for you; for you are not strong\nenough to do it yourself.\"\n\n\"I should not like to ask her. She's a poor woman, and it would be just\nthe same as begging to ask her to give me her work.\"\n\n\"You don't understand me, Katy. She goes out to work whenever she can\nget a chance. Her price is ten cents an hour. You can engage her for\none or two hours, and pay her for her labor. This is the only way you\ncan get along with this business.\"\n\n\"I will do that. It won't take more than an hour.\"\n\nMrs. Colvin was accordingly engaged, though at first she positively\nrefused to be paid for her services; but when Katy told her she should\nwant her for one or two hours every day, she consented to the\narrangement. Early in the evening the candy was all made, and Katy's\nday's work was finished. Notwithstanding her repeated declaration that\nshe was not tired, the bed \"felt good\" to her, and she slept all the\nmore soundly for the hard work and the good deeds she had done.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nKATY PAYS HER DEBTS, AND TOMMY GOES TO SEA.\n\nKaty's second day's sales, though not so large as those of the first\nday, were entirely satisfactory. The profits, after paying for the\n\"stock\" and for the services of Mrs. Colvin, were nearly a dollar, and\nher heart beat with renewed hope at this continued success. Her grand\nidea hardly seemed like an experiment now, for she had proved that she\ncould make good candy, and that people were willing to buy the article.\nShe met with about the same treatment from those to whom she offered\nher wares; one spoke kindly, and purchased by wholesale, and another\nspoke gruffly, and would not buy even a single stick. Here she was\ndriven out of doors, and there she was petted, and made large sales.\n\nSo far as Katy's person and manners were concerned, she was admirably\nadapted to the business she had chosen. She was rather small in stature\nfor one of her age, but she was very well formed, and her movements\nwere agile and graceful. Her face was not as pretty as it might have\nbeen, but her expression was artless and winning. Her light brown hair\nhung in curls upon her shoulders, and contributed not a little to make\nup the deficiency in what the painters and sculptors would call a\nfinely chiseled face.\n\nIf she had been dressed in silk, and lace, and embroidery, I doubt not\npeople would have called her pretty, though in my opinion it does not\nmake much difference whether she was pretty or not; for, after all, the\nbest way to judge of a person's beauty is by the old standard,\n\"Handsome is that handsome does.\" But I have said thus much about\nKaty's face and form in order to explain the secret of her great\nsuccess as a candy merchant. Hundreds of persons would buy a stick of\ncandy of a little girl with a pretty face and a graceful form, who\nwould not do so of one less attractive. Though she was well favored in\nthis respect, I believe it was her gentle, polite manners, her sweet\nvoice, made sweet by a loving heart, that contributed most to her\nsuccess. But above all the accidents of a good form, graceful\nmovements, brown ringlets, and a pleasing address, she prospered in\ntrade because she was in earnest, and persevered in all her efforts. A\nperson cannot succeed in business by being merely good looking, though\nthis may sometimes be of much assistance. It is patience, perseverance,\nenergy, and above all, integrity and uprightness, that lead to the true\nsuccess.\n\nEncouraged by her prosperity, Katy continued to sell candy with about\nthe same result as had cheered her heart on the first two days. Her\nprofits, however, were not so great as on those two days, and did not\naverage above seventy-five cents a day or four dollars and a half a\nweek. This was doing exceedingly well, and she had every reason to be\ngrateful for her good fortune.\n\nAt the end of three weeks, rent day came round again, and Dr. Flynch\ncalled for the money. To his utter astonishment, it was ready for him,\nand he departed without a single ill-natured word, though this was,\nperhaps, because he had a wholesome regard for the opinion of Mrs.\nGordon. Two weeks later Katy found that her savings were sufficient to\nenable her to pay the month's rent for which Mrs. Gordon had given a\nreceipt, and also the dollar which Grace had loaned her. These debts\nhad pressed heavily on her mind. She knew that they were regarded as\nfree gifts and her pride prompted her to remove what she considered a\nstain upon her character. Till they were paid, she felt like a beggar.\n\nTaking her money one day, she paid a visit to Temple Street. Michael\nopened the door and received her with a smile. Knowing she was in favor\nwith his mistress, he conducted her to the sitting-room, where the\nportraits hung. Those roguish eyes of the lady, who somewhat resembled\nher mother, were fixed on her again. She was sure that her mother did\nnot look like that picture then, but she was equally sure that she had,\nsome time or other cast just such a glance at her. The expression of\nthe lady found something like its  counterpart in her memory. Now, her\nmother was sick and sad; she seldom smiled. But some time she must have\nbeen a young girl, and then she must have looked like that portrait.\nShe felt just like asking Mrs. Gordon if that was her portrait, but she\ndid not dare to do such a thing. While she was attentively watching the\nroguish lady's face, her kind friend entered the room, followed by\nGrace.\n\n\"How do you do, Katy?\" said the former, with a benevolent smile.\n\n\"Quite well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you will excuse me for coming\nagain,\" replied she.\n\n\"I am very glad you have come.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of you the other day, and wishing I might see you,\"\nadded Grace, \"for the Mayor told us a very pretty story about you.\"\n\n\"He was very good to me; and I never shall forget him or you,\" answered\nKaty, warmly.\n\n\"I suppose you have come to get another receipt; but I told Dr. Flynch\nnot to disturb you,\" said Mrs. Gordon.\n\n\"O, no ma'am--I didn't come for that. You were too kind to me before,\nand I have come now to pay you for that month's rent.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; we have been able to earn money enough, and I am very glad\nthat I can pay it,\" replied Katy, taking the four dollars from her\npocket. \"Here it is.\"\n\n\"No, my child; you shall keep it. I will not take it.\"\n\nKaty's cheeks flushed, for she did not feel poor and proud then. She\nfelt rich; that is she was proud of being able to pay all she owed, and\nshe did not like to be thought capable of accepting a gift--of being\nthe recipient of charity. But she knew the hearts of her kind friends,\nand left unspoken the words of indignation that trembled on her tongue.\n\"Please to take the money, ma'am,\" said she her cheeks still red with\nshame.\n\n\"No, my child; you are a good girl; I will not take your money.\"\n\n\"I shall feel very bad if you don't, and it will make my mother very\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"Nay, Katy, you must not be too proud.\"\n\n\"I am not too proud to ask or to accept a favor, but please don't make\nme feel like a beggar.\"\n\n\"You are a very strange child,\" said Mrs. Gordon.\n\n\"Indeed you are,\" added Grace\n\n\"I shall not feel right if you don't take this money. You know I\npromised to pay you at the time you gave me the receipt.\"\n\n\"I did not suppose you would, that is, I did not think you would be\nable to pay it. Your mother has got well, then?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am; she is better, but she does not sit up any yet.\"\n\n\"Then how did you get this money?\"\n\n\"I earned it.\"\n\n\"You!\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; selling candy.\"\n\n\"Is it possible? The mayor told me you were a little candy merchant,\nbut I did not suppose you carried on such an extensive trade.\"\n\n\"I make a great deal of money; almost five dollars a week; and now I am\nable, I hope you will let me pay you.\"\n\n\"If you insist upon it, I shall, though I had much rather you would\nkeep the money.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am. I shall feel much better when it is paid.\"\n\nMrs. Gordon reluctantly received the four dollars. It was a very small\nsum to her, though a very large one to Katy. She saw that the little\ncandy merchant's pride was of the right kind, and she was not disposed\nto give her any unnecessary mortification, though she resolved that\nneither Katy nor her mother should ever want a friend in their need.\n\n\"I owe you one dollar, also,\" continued Katy, advancing to the side of\nGrace.\n\n\"Well, I declare!\" laughed Grace. \"If that isn't a good one!\"\n\n\"I promised to pay you; and you know I would not take the money as a\ngift,\" replied Katy.\n\n\"I am aware that you would not, and you are the promptest paymistress I\never knew.\"\n\n\"With the dollar you lent me, I bought the molasses to make the first\nlot of candy I sold. Your dollar has done a great deal of good.\"\n\n\"I am glad it has; but I don't want to take it.\"\n\n\"Won't you let me feel like myself?\"\n\n\"Certainly I will,\" laughed Grace.\n\n\"Then let me pay my debts, and not feel just like a beggar.\"\n\n\"You are the queerest child I ever saw!\" exclaimed Grace, as she took\nthe dollar. \"I am going to keep this dollar for you, and perhaps some\ntime you will not be so proud as you are now, though I hope you will\nalways have all the money you want.\"\n\n\"I think I shall, if my trade continues to be good,\" replied Katy, who,\nnow that all her debts had been paid, felt a heavy load removed from\nher heart.\n\n\"You must bring your candy up here. The mayor says it is very good. I\nhave a sweet tooth, and I will buy lots of it,\" added Grace.\n\n\"I will bring you up some to-morrow,\" replied Katy, moving towards the\ndoor, and casting a last glance at the mischievous lady in the picture.\n\n\"The mayor told me to ask you to call and see him again,\" said Mrs.\nGordon. \"He is very much interested in you.\"\n\n\"He is very kind;\" and she bade them good-by.\n\nKaty felt highly honored by the notice the mayor had taken of her. Like\nMaster Simon Sneed, she felt almost like calling him her friend the\nmayor; but she resolved to call upon him on her way home. He received\nher very kindly, told her what a mistake she had made in giving the\npawnbroker his note, who had never delivered it to the marshal, and\npromised to buy lots of candy when she came with her tray.\n\nWhen she returned home she found a message there from Tommy Howard,\nrequesting to see her that afternoon. She did not feel like spending\nany more time in idleness, when she had so much candy to sell; but\nTommy's request was not to be neglected; and, taking her tray, she\ncalled at his house as she passed up to the court.\n\nTommy had been talking for a year about going to sea, and had been for\nsome time on the lookout for a chance as a cabin-boy or a reefer. He\nhad told her his plans, how he intended to be a good sailor and work\nhis way up to be captain of some fine ship. She suspected, therefore,\nthat he had found a chance to go to sea, and wanted to tell her all\nabout it.\n\nShe found him at home, waiting her expected visit; but a feeling of\nsadness came over her when she saw his manly face, and thought how\nbadly she should feel if he should go off on the ocean, and, perhaps,\nbe drowned in its vast depths. He had been her friend and protector.\nJohnny Grippen hardly dared to look at her since the flogging he had\ngiven him; and Katy thought, perhaps, if he went away, that she should\nhave no one to defend her.\n\n\"I am going to-morrow, Katy,\" said he, after he had given her a seat by\nthe window.\n\n\"To sea?\" asked Katy, gloomily.\n\n\"Yes; I have got a first-rate ship, and she sails to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry you are going!\"\n\n\"O, never mind it, Katy; I shall be back one of these days. I wanted to\ntell you if Johnny Grippen gives you any impudence, to let me know and\nI'll lick him when I come back.\"\n\n\"I guess he won't.\"\n\n\"He may; if he does, you had better tell his father.\"\n\n\"But where are you going, Tommy?\"\n\n\"To Liverpool.\"\n\nKaty started. Her grandfather lived there. After a moment's thought she\nconceived a plan which made her heart bound with emotion. She could\nsend word to her grandfather, by Tommy, that she and her mother were in\nBoston, and then he would send over after them, and they could live in\nhis fine house, and she should be as happy as a queen. Then she and her\nmother might be passengers in Tommy's ship--and wouldn't they have\ngreat times on the passage! And as her grandfather was a merchant, and\nowned ships, she might be able to do something for Tommy.\n\nUnder the seal of secrecy she related to her young sailor friend all\nthe particulars of her mother's history; and he wrote down the names\nshe gave him. Tommy promised to hunt all over Liverpool till he found\nher grandfather; and to insure him a good reception, Katy wrote a short\nletter to him, in which she stated the principal facts in the case.\n\n\"Now, good-by, Tommy,\" said she, wiping away a tear; \"I shall think of\nyou every day, and pray for you too. I hope there won't be any storms\nto sink your ship.\"\n\n\"We shan't mind the storms. Good-by, Katy.\"\n\nShe felt very badly all the rest of the day, and her sales were smaller\nthan usual, for her energy was diminished in proportion to the sadness\nof her heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nKATY EMPLOYS AN ASSISTANT.\n\nAs winter approached, Katy realized that the demand for molasses candy\nwas on the increase, and she found it necessary to make a much larger\nquantity. Mrs. Colvin still rendered her assistance \"for a\nconsideration,\" and the supply was thus made to correspond with the\ndemand.\n\nMrs. Redburn's health which had begun to improve with the advent of\ntheir prosperity, now enabled her to sit up nearly the whole day, and\nto render much aid in the household affairs, and especially in the\nmanufacturing of the candy. The good fortune that had attended Katy's\nefforts brought many additional comforts to their humble dwelling;\nindeed, they had everything that they needed, and everything that any\npoor person would have required. But the fond mother had never been\nable to reconcile herself to the business which Katy followed. She\ndreaded every day lest the temptations to which it constantly exposed\nher might lead her astray. She loved her daughter with all her heart,\nand she would rather have died in poverty and want than have had her\ncorrupted. She had every reason to believe that Katy was the pure and\ninnocent child she had always been; but she feared, as she grew older,\nthat some harm might befall her. She would rather bury her than see her\nbecome a bad person, and she hoped soon to be able to resume her own\nlabors, and let Katy abandon her dangerous business.\n\nMrs. Redburn often talked with her about the perils that lay in her\npath; but Katy spoke like one who was fortified by good resolutions and\na strong will. She declared that she knew what dangers were in her way,\nand that she could resist all the temptations that beset her. Whatever\nviews the mother had, there seemed to be no opportunity to carry them\nout, for by Katy's labors they were fed, clothed, and housed. She was\nher mother's only support, and the candy trade, perilous as it was,\ncould not be given up.\n\nKaty did not desire to abandon the business she had built up, for she\nwas proud of her achievement. She was resolved to be good and true, and\nto her it did not seem half so perilous as to others. She had even\nindulged some thoughts of enlarging her business. Why could she not\nhave a shop, and sell candy on a counter as well as in the street? She\nmentioned this idea to her mother, who was sure the shop could not\nsucceed, for she was aware that her daughter's winning manners were\nmore than half her stock in trade, and that her large sales resulted\nfrom carrying the candy to hundreds of people who did not want it\nenough to go after it. Therefore Katy gave up the shop at once, but she\ndid not abandon the idea of enlarging her business, though she did not\nexactly see how it could be done. One day an accident solved the\nproblem for her, and at that time commenced a new era in the candy\ntrade.\n\nOne pleasant morning in November, as she walked up the court, she met\nAnn Grippen, a sister of Johnny who stopped to talk with her. The\nGrippen family consisted of eleven persons. The father was a day\nlaborer, and as his wages were small, and he had a great many mouths to\nfeed, they were, of course, miserably poor. The older children showed\nno ability or disposition to help their parents but spent most of their\ntime in strolling about the streets. Johnny was a fair specimen of the\nboys, as Ann was of the girls. She might have been seen almost any day\nwith a well-worn basket on her arm, exploring the streets and wharves\nin search of chips, for Johnny was too vicious to do the work which\nmore properly belonged to him.\n\n\"You sell lots of candy now--don't you?\" said Ann.\n\n\"Yes, a great deal,\" replied Katy, who was not disposed to spend her\ntime idly, and in the company of one whose reputation in the\nneighborhood was not very good.\n\n\"Stop a minute--won't you? I want to speak to you.\"\n\n\"I will; but be as quick as you can, for I am in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Don't you think I could sell candy?\" continued Ann.\n\n\"I dare say you could. Why don't you try, if you want to?\"\n\n\"But I haven't got no candy; and mother can't make it, as you can. If\nyou are a mind to let me have some, I will sell it for you, and you may\ngive me what you like.\"\n\nThe idea struck the little merchant very favorably. There were a great\nmany girls just like Ann Grippen, who were wasting their time about the\nstreets, and learning to be wicked. Why couldn't she employ them to\nsell candy?\n\n\"I will try you,\" replied Katy.\n\n\"Well, I'm all ready to begin.\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said the little candy merchant, with a smile.\n\n\"Yes, I am.\"\n\n\"Your face and hands are very dirty.\"\n\n\"What odds will that make?\" asked Ann, rather indignantly.\n\n\"Do you suppose anybody would eat a stick of candy after you had\ntouched it with those dirty fingers? Your customers would be afraid of\nbeing poisoned.\"\n\n\"I s'pose I can wash 'em,\" replied Ann, who seemed still to regard it\nas a very unnecessary operation.\n\n\"It would be a good plan; and while you are about it you must not\nforget your face.\"\n\n\"I ain't a-going to touch the candy with my face,\" added Ann,\ntriumphantly.\n\n\"Very true; but if people saw you with such a dirty face, they would be\nafraid your candy was not very clean.\"\n\n\"Any way you like. I will wash my face and hands both, if that's all.\"\n\n\"But that isn't all. Your dress is very dirty and very ragged.\"\n\n\"I can't afford to dress like a lady,\" said Ann, who had some of her\nbrother's disposition, and under any other circumstances would have\nresented Katy's plain home thrusts.\n\n\"You needn't dress like a lady; but the neater and cleaner you are, the\nmore candy you will sell.\"\n\n\"I will fix up as much as I can.\"\n\n\"Very well; if you will come to my house to-morrow morning, I will let\nyou have some candy.\"\n\n\"How much will you give me for selling it?\" asked Ann.\n\n\"I can't tell now; I will think about it, and let you know when you\ncome.\"\n\nKaty went her way, turning over and over in her mind the scheme which\nAnn's application had suggested to her. She might employ a dozen girls,\nor even more than that, and pay them so much a dozen for selling the\ncandy. She might then stop going out to sell herself, and thus gratify\nher mother. She could even go to school, and still attend to her\nbusiness.\n\nWhen she returned home at noon, she proposed the plan to her mother.\nMrs. Redburn was much pleased with it, though she suggested many\ndifficulties in the way of its success. The girls might not be honest;\nbut if they were not, they could be discharged. Many of them were\nvicious; they would steal or be saucy, so that people would not permit\nthem to enter their stores and offices, and the business would thus be\nbrought into disrepute. Katy determined to employ the best girls she\ncould find, and to tell them all that they must behave like ladies.\n\nThe next morning Ann Grippen appeared with her face and hands tolerably\nclean, and wearing a dress which by a liberal construction could be\ncalled decent. She brought a dirty, rusty old tray, which was the best\nshe could obtain; yet in spite of all these disadvantages, the little\ncandy merchant looked upon it as a hopeful case.\n\n\"Now, Ann, you must be very civil to everybody you meet,\" said Katy, as\nshe covered the rusty tray with a sheet of clean white paper.\n\n\"I hope I know how to behave myself,\" replied Ann, rather crustily.\n\n\"I dare say you do;\" and she might have hinted that there was some\ndifference between knowing how to do a thing and doing it. \"I was only\ngoing to tell you how to sell candy. If you don't want me to tell you,\nI won't.\"\n\n\"I should like to have you tell me, but I guess I know how to behave.\"\n\n\"You must be very civil to everybody, even when they don't speak very\npleasant to you.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that,\" replied Ann, doubtfully, for it was contrary\nto the Grippen philosophy to be very civil to any one, much less to\nthose who were not civil to them.\n\n\"When any one buys any candy of you, you must always say, 'Thank you';\nand then the next time you meet the person he will buy again.\"\n\n\"How much you going to give me for selling?\" demanded Ann, abruptly\ncutting short the instructions.\n\n\"Mother thinks you ought to have four cents a dozen.\"\n\n\"Four cents? My mother says I ought to have half, and I ain't going to\nsell your candy for no four cents a dozen.\"\n\n\"Very well; you needn't if you don't wish to do so;\" and Katy removed\nthe sheet of white paper she had placed over the dirty tray.\n\n\"You ought to give me half I get,\" added Ann, rather softened by Katy's\nfirmness and decision.\n\n\"Four cents is enough. I often sell a hundred sticks in a day.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't care; I will try it once.\"\n\n\"If we find we can afford to pay any more than four cents, we will do\nso.\"\n\nKaty covered the tray again, and arranged two dozen sticks on it in an\nattractive manner. After giving Ann some further instructions in the\nart of selling candy, she permitted her to depart on her mission. She\nwas not very  confident in regard to her success for Ann was too coarse\nand ill-mannered for a good sales-woman. She hoped for the best,\nhowever, and after preparing her own tray, she went out to attend to\nbusiness as usual. In the court she saw Master Simon Sneed, who was\nsitting on his father's doorstep. She noticed that he looked sad and\ndownhearted; and when he spoke to her the tones of his voice indicated\nthe same depression of spirits.\n\n\"Have you seen the Mayor lately, Katy?\" asked Simon, as he approached.\n\n\"Not very lately.\"\n\n\"I should like to see him,\" added he, raising his eyes to her.\n\n\"Why don't you call upon him? You know where he lives--don't you?\"\n\n\"Yes, but----\"\n\nMaster Simon paused, as though he did not like to explain the reason.\nKaty waited for him to proceed, but as he did not, she remarked that he\nlooked very sad, and she hoped nothing had happened.\n\n\"Something has happened,\" replied he, gloomily.\n\n\"Nothing bad, I hope.\"\n\n\"I have left my place at Sands & Co.'s.\n\n\"Left it? Why, how can they possibly get along without you?\" exclaimed\nKaty.\n\n\"It is their own fault; and though I say it who should not say it, they\nwill never find another young man who will do as much for them as I\nhave done.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think they would have let you go.\"\n\n\"Nor I; but some men never know when they are well used.\"\n\n\"How did it happed?\"\n\n\"I asked them for an increase of salary, and told them I could stay no\nlonger unless they did so. And what do you think they did?\"\n\n\"I don't know; I should suppose they would have raised your salary.\"\n\n\"No, Katy,\" added Simon, bitterly. \"Mr. Sands told me I might go; he\nwouldn't have me at any rate. Wasn't that cool? Well, well; if they\ndon't know their own interest, they must bear the consequences. If they\nfail, or lose all their trade, they can't blame me for it. Now I have\nnothing to do; and I was just thinking whether my friend the mayor\ncouldn't help me into a situation.\"\n\n\"I dare say he can. Why don't you call and see him at once?\"\n\n\"I don't like to do so. He sees so many persons that I really don't\nthink he would recollect me. I must get something to do, though; for my\nfather is sick, and winter is coming on.\"\n\n\"How much salary did you get, Master Simon?\" asked Katy, who highly\napproved his determination not to be a burden upon his father.\n\n\"Two dollars and a half a week.\"\n\n\"Is that all!\"\n\n\"Yes; they ought to have given me ten. Even that was better than\nnothing.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of something, Master Simon,\" said Katy, after a pause.\n\n\"What, Katy?\"\n\n\"I make four or five dollars a week.\"\n\n\"Is it possible!\"\n\n\"If you have a mind to sell candy, I will furnish you all you want, so\nthat you can make at least three dollars a week.\"\n\nThe lip of Master Simon slowly curled, till his face bore an expression\nof sovereign contempt. He rose from his seat, and fixed his eyes rather\nsternly upon the little candy merchant, who began to think she had made\na bad mistake, though all the time she had intended to do a kind act.\n\n\"What have I done, Katy, that you should insult me? Do you think I have\nsunk so low as to peddle candy about the streets?\" said he,\ncontemptuously.\n\n\"Do you think I have sunk very low, Master Simon?\" asked Katy, with a\npleasant smile on her face.\n\n\"Your business is very low,\" he replied, more gently.\n\n\"Is that business low by which I honestly make money enough to support\nmy sick mother and myself?\"\n\n\"It would be low for me; my ideas run a little higher than that,\"\nanswered Simon, rather disposed to apologize for his hard words; for\nKaty's smile had conquered him, as a smile oftener will conquer than a\nhard word.\n\n\"You know best; but if I can do anything for you, Master Simon, I shall\nbe very glad to do so.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Katy; you mean right, but never speak to me about selling\ncandy again. I think you can help me.\"\n\n\"Then I will.\"\n\n\"I will see you again when I get my plan arranged. In the meantime, if\nyou happen to meet my friend the mayor, just speak a good word for me.\"\n\n\"I will;\" and Katy left him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nMASTER SIMON SNEED MAKES A MISTAKE.\n\nContrary to the expectations of Katy and her mother, Ann Grippen\nreturned at noon with her tray empty, having sold the whole two dozen\nsticks.\n\n\"Well, Ann, how do you like the business?\" asked Katy.\n\n\"First rate. Here is twenty-four cents,\" replied Ann; and it was\nevident, from her good-natured laugh, that she was much encouraged by\nher success.\n\n\"You may give me sixteen; the other eight belong to you.\"\n\n\"I think I can do something at it,\" added Ann, as she regarded with\nmuch satisfaction the first money she had ever earned in her life.\n\n\"You can, if you work it right; but you must be very gentle and\npatient; you must keep yourself clean and----\"\n\n\"Well, I guess I know all about that,\" interrupted Ann, who did not\nlike this style of remark.\n\n\"Katy,\" said her mother, who was sitting in her rocking-chair, by the\nfire.\n\n\"What, mother?\"\n\n\"Come here a moment.\"\n\nKaty crossed the room to her mother, to hear what she wished to say.\n\n\"You must not talk to her in that style,\" said Mrs. Redburn, in a tone\nso low that Ann could not hear her.\n\n\"Why not, mother? I was only telling her how to do.\"\n\n\"But you speak in that tone of superiority which no one likes to hear.\nYou are but a child, as she is, and she will not listen to such advice\nfrom you.\"\n\nKaty wondered what her mother would have thought if she had heard what\nshe said to Ann the day before. Yet she was conscious that she had \"put\non airs,\" and talked like a very old and a very wise person.\n\n\"I suppose you would like to go out again this afternoon,\" resumed\nKaty, joining her assistant again.\n\n\"I don't care if I do.\"\n\n\"Well, come this afternoon, and you shall have some more candy;\" and\nAnn ran home to get her dinner.\n\n\"I think my plan will work well, mother,\" said Katy, when she had gone.\n\n\"It has so far, but you must not be too sure.\"\n\n\"I mean to go out after dinner and hunt up some more girls, for you see\nI shall have no candy to sell myself this afternoon, when I have given\nAnn two dozen sticks.\"\n\n\"I hope you will not attempt to lecture them as you did her.\"\n\n\"Why, mother, I know all about the business and they don't know\nanything.\"\n\n\"I doubt not you are competent to advise them; but the manner in which\nyou address them is more offensive than the matter. Your knowledge of\nthe business makes you treat them as inferiors. You must not think too\nmuch of yourself, Katy.\"\n\n\"No danger of that, mother.\"\n\n\"I am afraid there is. Persons in authority, who are gentle and kind,\nand do not act like superiors, are more promptly obeyed, and more loved\nand respected, than those who are puffed up by their office, and\ntyrannical in their manners.\"\n\n\"But I am not a person in authority, mother,\" laughed Katy.\n\n\"You will be, if you employ a dozen girls to sell candy for you.\"\n\nAfter Katy had eaten her dinner, and fitted out Ann Grippen, she left\nthe house in search of some more assistants. She was well known to all\nthe boys and girls in the neighborhood; and when she stated her object\nto one and another of them, she was readily understood. To help her\ncause, it had begun to be known that Ann Grippen had been seen with a\nclean face, selling candy in the street. She had no difficulty,\ntherefore, in procuring the services of half a dozen girls, who were\ndelighted with the plan especially when Katy informed them of Ann's\nsuccess.\n\nOn her return home, she found that Simon Sneed had called to see her,\nand she immediately hastened to his house. When she knocked, he came to\nthe door and invited her into the parlor.\n\n\"Well, Katy, I have hit upon something,\" said he.\n\n\"I am glad you have.\"\n\n\"I went down town after I saw you, and hearing of a place in Tremont\nRow, I went to apply for it.\"\n\n\"Did you get it?\"\n\n\"Not yet, but I hope to get it. They agreed to give me three dollars a\nweek if everything proved satisfactory; but they wanted a\nrecommendation from my last employers.\"\n\n\"Of course they will give you one.\"\n\n\"No, they would not; they were offended because I left them.\"\n\n\"Then you asked them?\"\n\n\"Yes, I went after one this afternoon, and they would not give it to\nme. I did not much expect they would, and so I informed Messrs. Runn &\nReed, the firm to which I have applied for an engagement. I told them\nexactly how the case stood; that I had demanded higher wages, and the\nMessrs. Sands were angry with me for doing so, and for that reason\nrefused the testimonial. They saw through it all, and understood my\nposition. When I spoke to them about my friend the mayor, they looked\nsurprised, and said a recommendation from him would satisfy them. So\nyou see just how I am situated.\"\n\n\"Why don't you go to him at once, and ask him for the recommendation?\"\nsaid Katy wondering why he hesitated at so plain a case.\n\nBut Master Simon had some scruples about doing so. He was old enough to\nknow that it was rather a delicate business to ask a man in a high\nofficial station for a testimonial on so slight an acquaintance. The\nmayor was interested in Katy, though she did not presume to call him\nher friend. She had twice called upon him, and she might again.\n\n\"I don't like to ask him, Katy. I feel some delicacy about doing so.\"\n\n\"I should just as lief ask him as not, if I were you. I am afraid you\nare too proud, Master Simon.\"\n\n\"I am proud, Katy: that's just it. I was born to be a gentleman, but I\nsubmit to my lot. I am willing to sell my talents and my labor for\nmoney. If I can once get in at Runn & Reed's, I am sure they will\nappreciate me, and consider it a lucky day on which they engaged me.\"\n\n\"If you want me to go to the mayor's house with you, I will,\" said\nKaty, who did not clearly comprehend Simon's wishes.\n\n\"Well, I think I will not go myself,\" replied Simon.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I do not like to place myself in a humiliating posture before great\nmen. If I were mayor of Boston, I should like to do him the favor which\nI ask for myself. When I am--\"\n\n\"You haven't asked him, Master Simon.\"\n\n\"In a word, Katy, I want you to ask him for me. You will do me a great\nfavor.\"\n\n\"I will,\" replied Katy, promptly.\n\n\"The mayor is a very fine man, kind-hearted, and willing to help\neverybody that deserves help; and if he were not my friend, I should\nfeel no delicacy in asking him myself. You can state the case, and\ninform him who I am, and what I am; that you know me to be honest and\nfaithful. You can tell him, too, that I am a gentlemanly person, of\npleasing address.\"\n\n\"But I can't remember all that,\" interposed Katy.\n\n\"Tell him what you can recollect, then. He is an easy, good-natured\nman, and will give you the testimonial at once.\"\n\n\"Suppose you write a paper, just such as you want, Master Simon. Then\nhe can copy it.\"\n\n\"Well I will do that.\"\n\nSimon seated himself at a table, and, after considerable effort,\nproduced the following piece of elegant composition, which he read to\nKaty:--\n\n\n\"To whom it may concern:\n\n\"This may certify that I have been for some time acquainted with my\nfriend Mr. Simon Sneed, and I believe him to be an honest and faithful\nyoung man, of gentlemanly bearing, pleasing address, and polite\nmanners, who will be an honor and an ornament to any establishment that\nmay be so fortunate as to secure his valuable services; and I\ncheerfully recommend him to any person to whom he may apply for a\nsituation. Mayor of Boston.\"\n\n\n\"I have left a blank space for his honor's signature,\" continued Master\nSimon, when he had read the modest document. \"What do you think of it,\nKaty?\"\n\n\"It is very fine. What a great scholar you must be! I should think\nyou'd write a book.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I may one of these days.\"\n\n\"I will go right up to the mayor's house now,\" said Katy, as she bade\nhim good afternoon.\n\nBefore she went, she returned home and nicely enclosed six sticks of\ncandy in white paper as a present for Freddie, the mayor's little son.\nOn her way up to Park Street she opened Simon's paper, and read it. It\nsounded funny to her, with its big words and fine sentences; and then\nwhat a puffing Master Simon had given himself! She even began to wonder\nif there was not something about her gentlemanly friend which was not\nall right.\n\nShe reached the mayor's house, and as it was his time to be at home,\nshe was conducted to the library.\n\n\"Ah, Katy, I am glad to see you,\" said he, taking her hand.\n\n\"Thank you, sir. I have brought this candy for Master Freddie.\"\n\n\"You are very good, and I suppose you are so proud that I must not\noffer to pay you for it.\"\n\n\"If you please, don't, sir,\" replied Katy, unconsciously taking Master\nSimon's testimonial from her pocket. \"I don't want you to pay me in\nmoney, but you may pay me in another way, if you please.\"\n\n\"May I? What have you in your hand?\"\n\n\"A paper, sir. You remember Master Simon Sneed?\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"The young man at Sands & Co.'s.\"\n\n\"O, yes; the young gentleman that uses so many long words.\"\n\n\"He has left his place, and wants to get another.\"\n\n\"He has left it? Why was that?\"\n\n\"He asked for more wages. He has found another place, which he can have\nif he can get a testimonial.\"\n\n\"Let him ask Sands & Co.\"\n\n\"They won't give him one, because they are so angry with him for\nleaving them.\"\n\n\"That indeed!\"\n\n\"Master Simon wants you to give him one,\" continued Katy, who, in her\nconfusion was jumping at the conclusion of the matter rather too\nhastily, and before she had produced a proper impression in regard to\nher hero's transcendent character and ability.\n\n\"Does he, indeed,\" laughed the mayor. \"He is very modest.\"\n\n\"He said, as you are his friend, you would not object to giving him\none.\"\n\n\"What have you in your hand, Katy? Has he written one to save me the\ntrouble?\" laughed the mayor.\n\n\"I asked him to do so. You can copy it off, if you please, sir.\"\n\nThe mayor took the testimonial and proceeded to read it. Katy had\nalready concluded from his manner that the business was not all\ncorrect, and she wished herself out of the scrape. He finished the\nreading, and then burst into a violent fit of laughter.\n\n\"Your friend is very modest, Katy;--my friend Mr. Simon Sneed.\"\n\n\"I hope I haven't done anything wrong, sir?\" stammered Katy.\n\n\"No, Katy; you have been imposed upon by a silly young man. You meant\nto do him a kindness--in your heart you had nothing but kindness--and I\nthink the more of you for what you have done, and the less of Simon for\nwhat he has done. Did he think I would recommend him, when I know\nnothing about him? He is a conceited puppy, and, in my opinion, a\nworthless fellow. One of these days he will be 'an honor and an\nornament' to the workhouse, if he does business in this manner.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Katy, frightened at the remarks of the mayor.\n\n\"Now, Katy, we will go to the store of the Messrs. Sands & Co., and\nfind out about this young man. I will meet you there at half-past four.\nGood-by, Katy. Freddie thinks ever so much of you now, and in his\nbehalf I thank you for the candy.\"\n\nKaty did not know exactly what to make of her position but at the time\nfixed, she was at the store of Sands & Co., where the mayor soon joined\nher.\n\n\"Now, Katy, you shall hear what his employers say of Master Simon,\"\nsaid he; and she followed him into the store.\n\nThe mayor stated his business, and inquired concerning the character of\nSimon.\n\n\"He is honest, and did his work very well,\" replied Mr. Sands.\n\nKaty was pleased to hear this, and the mayor confessed his surprise.\n\n\"But he was an intolerable nuisance about the store,\" continued Mr.\nSands. \"With only a small amount of modesty, he would have done very\nwell; as it was, he was the biggest man in our employ. Our customers\nwere disgusted with him, and we had been thinking of getting rid of him\nfor a long time. When he asked for more wages, impudently declaring he\nwould leave if we did not accede to his demand, we discharged him. In a\nword, I wouldn't have him round the store at any price.\"\n\n\"As I supposed,\" replied the mayor, as he showed Mr. Sands the\nrecommendation Simon had written.\n\n\"This sounds just like him.\"\n\nKaty pitied poor Simon now that she understood him, and she went home\ndetermined to tell him all that had passed between the mayor and\nherself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nKATY GETS A LETTER FROM LIVERPOOL.\n\nMaster Simon Sneed sat at the window when Katy returned, and she had to\ntell him all about it. She pitied him, poor fellow, and she hoped the\nlesson would do him good. She did not like to tell him so many\nunpleasant things, for they would wound his pride.\n\n\"Well, Katy, what did my friend the mayor say?\" asked Simon, as he\njoined her on the sidewalk.\n\n\"I am afraid you will not call him your friend after this,\" replied\nKaty.\n\n\"Why? He had not the effrontery to refuse my reasonable request?\"\n\n\"The what? Please to use words that I can understand,\" said she, for\nshe was not a little disgusted with Simon's big words, now she knew how\nmuch mischief they had done him.\n\n\"Didn't he give you the paper?\"\n\n\"He did not.\"\n\n\"I didn't think that of him. It was shabby.\"\n\n\"He said he did not know you. But I showed him your paper, in which you\nhad written down what you thought of yourself.\"\n\n\"Well, what did he say to that?\" asked Simon, eagerly.\n\n\"I thought he would split his fat sides laughing. He didn't seem to\nbelieve a word of it.\"\n\n\"He didn't? I am surprised at that.\"\n\n\"He said you were a conceited puppy.\"\n\n\"I always took the mayor for a sensible fellow; I see I have been\nmistaken.\"\n\n\"He didn't like it because you sent me to him upon such an errand. He\nsaid you had imposed upon me.\"\n\n\"Go on, Katy; I may expect anything after what you have said,\" replied\nSimon, with all the coolness and indifference he could command.\n\n\"He said he believed you were a worthless fellow. Then he told me to\nmeet him at the store of the Messrs. Sands & Co., and he would inquire\nabout you.\"\n\n\"Then you went to the store?\"\n\n\"We did; and when the mayor asked Mr. Sands about you, he said you were\nhonest, and did your work well, but----\"\n\n\"Notice that remark particularly. I hope you called the mayor's\nattention to it,\" interrupted Master Simon. \"What else did he say?\"\n\n\"He said you were a nuisance----\"\n\n\"Observe how far his prejudices carried him. That man believed, if I\nstayed in the store, that I should supplant him and his partner. You\nsee how far he carried his spite.\"\n\n\"But he said all the good he could of you Simon,\" said Katy. \"He said\nyou were honest and did your work well.\"\n\n\"Can a nuisance be honest, and do work well? Hath not a Jew eyes?\"\nqueried Mr. Simon, with dramatic fervor.\n\n\"He didn't say anything about Jews.\"\n\n\"I was quoting Shakspeare, the immortal bard of Avon. Katy, Sands knew\nthat I was securing the respect and esteem of all his customers; and he\nknew very well if I should step into a rival establishment, I should\ntake half his trade with me,\" continued the injured Sneed.\n\n\"He said his customers were disgusted with you. You talked so big and\nthought so much of yourself, he would not have you in the store at any\nprice. But I should think that Runn & Reed would be glad to have you if\nyou can carry so much trade with you.\"\n\n\"They cannot know till I have had a chance to show them what I can do.\"\n\n\"I hope you will soon have such a chance.\"\n\n\"There is one thing about it; when I do, Sands & Co. will see the\nmistake they have made. I think the ladies that visit their store will\nmiss a familiar face. They used to insist upon my waiting upon them,\nthough it was not exactly in the line of my duty to sell goods. Often\nwas I called away from the bundle department to attend them. No one\nseemed to suit them but me. Why, it was only the day before I left that\nan elegant, aristocratic lady from Beacon Street made me go clear home\nwith her.\"\n\n\"Why, what for?\"\n\n\"To carry her bundle; but that was all a pretense.\"\n\n\"Did she invite you to tea, Master Simon?\" asked Katy, who could hardly\nhelp laughing in his face.\n\n\"No, but she kept me quarter of an hour at the door.\"\n\n\"What did she say?\"\n\n\"She was trying to make it out that I had brought the wrong bundle, and\nso she opened it, in the entry; but it was only to keep me there.\"\n\n\"You think she was smitten?\" laughed Katy.\n\n\"I have an opinion,\" replied Simon, sagely. \"There are a good many fine\nladies will miss my face.\"\n\nKaty didn't think any fine lady could be much charmed with that thin,\nhatchet face; and she realized now that Master Simon was a great heap\nof vanity. She never thought before that he could be so silly. She\nwanted to tell him that he was a great fool, for she feared he would\nnever find it out himself; but he was older than she was, and she did\nnot think it quite proper to do so.\n\n\"I must go now,\" said Katy. \"If you don't find anything you like\nbetter, you can sell candy, you know.\"\n\n\"Katy!\" exclaimed Simon, sternly.\n\n\"I am poor and proud, Master Simon; I am too proud to be dependent, or\ndo anything mean and wicked; but I am not too proud to sell candy.\"\n\n\"I am,\" replied Simon, with dignity.\n\n\"Then yours is a foolish pride,\" replied Katy, with a smile to soften\nthe hard words; and she walked away toward her own house.\n\nShe felt thankful that she had no such pride as Simon's; and she had\nreason to be thankful for when any person is too proud to do the work\nwhich God has placed within his reach, he becomes a pitiable object,\nand honest men will regard him with contempt.\n\nKaty had to work very hard that evening, in making candy for her\nassistants to sell, and it was nine o'clock before she was ready to go\nto bed.\n\nThe next morning, all the girls who had engaged to come, appeared with\ntheir trays, and were supplied with candy. Katy instructed them very\nmodestly in the art of selling; taking upon herself no airs, and\nassuming no superiority. Ann Grippen came with them, and seemed to be\nvery much pleased with her new occupation.\n\nAt noon they all returned, though only two of them had sold out their\ntwo dozen sticks. Katy gave them further instructions in regard to the\nbest places to sell candy, and when they came home at night, all but\none had disposed of their stock. The experiment, therefore was regarded\nas a successful one. The next day several other girls, who had heard of\nKaty's plan, came to the house, and wanted to be engaged. The little\nmerchant could not supply them, but promised, if they would come the\nnext day, to furnish them with a stock. Even now, the quantity\nmanufactured required the services of Mrs. Colvin for three hours, and\nthis day she engaged her to come immediately after dinner.\n\nI need not detail the manner in which Katy's trade kept increasing. In\na fortnight she had more than a dozen girls employed in selling candy.\nShe was actually making a wholesale business of it, and no longer\ntraveled about the streets herself. By the first of December, Mrs.\nRedburn had so far recovered her health as to be able to take charge of\nthe manufacturing part of the business, and Katy was permitted to go to\nschool, though she supplied the girls in the morning and at noon, and\nsettled all their accounts.\n\nOne day she received a call from Michael, Mrs. Gordon's man, requesting\nher attendance in Temple Street. She obeyed the summons; but when she\nmet Mrs. Gordon and Grace, she was alarmed to see how coldly and\nreproachfully they looked upon her.\n\n\"I have heard a very bad story about you, Katy,\" said Mrs. Gordon.\n\n\"About me?\" gasped she.\n\n\"Yes; and I was very sorry to hear it.\"\n\n\"What was it, ma'am? I hope I haven't done anything to lose your good\nwill.\"\n\n\"I am afraid you have.\"\n\n\"I don't believe she did it, mother,\" said Grace. \"She is too good to\ndo any such thing.\"\n\n\"What is it? Do tell me.\"\n\n\"I have been told that a little girl, who sells candy, has been playing\ntricks upon passers-by in the streets; that she tells lies and deceives\nthem.\"\n\n\"I never did such a thing!\" protested Katy, her cheeks covered with the\nblush of indignation.\n\nMrs. Gordon explained the deception, and spoke in very severe terms of\nit. The trick had been played off on a friend of hers, who had told of\nit the evening before.\n\n\"When was it, ma'am?\" asked Katy.\n\n\"Yesterday forenoon.\"\n\n\"I was in school then. Besides, I haven't sold any candy in the street\nfor more than three weeks.\"\n\n\"I knew it wasn't she!\" exclaimed Grace triumphantly.\n\n\"I was very unwilling to believe it,\" added Mrs. Gordon; \"but the\ndescription seemed to point you out as the little deceiver.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't do such a thing, ma'am. If you inquire you will find that I\nhave been in school every day this week.\"\n\n\"I believe you, Katy. But can you tell me who it was?\"\n\n\"I don't know, but I will find out;\" and before she took her leave she\ntold the ladies how she conducted her business, which amused them very\nmuch.\n\n\"Who played this trick?\" said she to herself when she got into the\nstreet. \"If I can only find out, I will discharge her. She will bring\nthe business into contempt.\"\n\nOf course no one would own it, and the only way she could find out was\nby watching them. It must be stopped, for, besides being too honest to\nallow such deception, Katy saw that it would spoil the trade.\n\nWhen she got home, she found a letter which the penny-post had brought,\ndirected to her in large schoolboy hand.\n\n\"It is from Tommy,\" exclaimed she, eagerly seizing the letter and\nretiring to a corner to read it.\n\n\"You and Tommy are great friends,\" said her mother.\n\n\"Yes, mother; but don't you see it came all the way from Liverpool?\"\n\nMrs. Redburn sighed deeply at the mention of her native city, and a\nthousand memories of the past flitted before her. Katy broke the seal,\nand as this letter contained some very important information, my young\nreaders may look over her shoulder while she reads it. It was as\nfollows:--\n\n\n                    Liverpool, Nov. 13, 1845.\n\n\"Dear Friend:--I take my pen in hand to let you know that I am well,\nand I hope these few lines will find you enjoying the same blessing. I\narrived to Liverpool safe and sound, and when I got home, I will tell\nyou all about it. Just as we got in to the dock, I kept thinking about\nwhat you told me. They won't let us have any fires on board ship in the\ndocks; so we all board ashore. I asked the man where we stopped if he\nknew such a merchant as Matthew Guthrie. He did not know him, and never\nheard of him. Then I went round among the big merchants, and asked\nabout your grandfather. I asked a good many before I found one who knew\nhim, and he said your grandfather had been dead ten years. I asked him\nwhere the family was. He said Mr. Guthrie had only two daughters; that\none of them had run away with her father's clerk, and the other was\nmarried and gone to America. He said her husband belonged to Baltimore.\nThis was all he knew about it, and all I could find out. We shall sail\nhome in about three weeks. I thought you would like to know; so I wrote\nthis letter to send by the steamer. Drop in and see my mother, and tell\nher I am well, and had a tiptop voyage over. No more at present from\n\n                   \"Your affectionate friend,\n                                  \"THOMAS HOWARD.\"\n\n\nKaty read the letter twice over, and then gave it to her mother, after\nexplaining that she had told Tommy her story, and requested him to\ninquire about her grandfather. Mrs. Redburn was too much affected by\nthe news from her early home to find fault with Katy for what she had\ndone.\n\nBoth of them felt very sad for while Mrs. Redburn thought of her\nfather, who had lain in his grave ten years without her knowledge, Katy\ncould not but mourn over the hopes which Tommy's letter had blasted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nANN GRIPPEN PLAYS TRICKS UPON TRAVELERS.\n\nThe next day was Wednesday, and as school kept but half a day, Katy\nresolved to spend the afternoon in finding out which of her employees\nwas in the habit of practicing the deception which Mrs. Gordon had\ndescribed to her. She could think of no one upon whom she could fasten\nthe guilt, unless it was Ann Grippen, who, she thought, would be more\nlikely to play such a trick than any other. After she had delivered\ntheir candy, she put on her things and followed the girls down to State\nStreet, where they separated. Ann went up Court Street, and Katy\ndecided that she needed watching, and so she followed her.\n\nIt was a very tedious afternoon to the little wholesale merchant, but\nthe dignity of the trade depended upon her efforts in seeking the\noffender. Ann entered various shops, and seemed to be having very good\nluck with her stock. At last she appeared to grow tired of her labors,\nand turned into an alley. Katy wondered what she was going to do there,\nfor it was certainly no place to sell candy. She waited sometime for\nher to come out, and when she heard her steps, she placed herself at\nthe corner of the alley, in such a position that Ann could not see her\nface.\n\nPresently she heard Ann crying with all her might; and crying so very\nnaturally that she could hardly persuade herself that it was not real.\nShe glanced over her shoulder at her, and discovered that she had\nbroken the nice sticks of candy into a great many little pieces; and it\nwas for this purpose that she had gone into the alley. Katy was\nindignant when she saw so much valuable merchandise thus ruthlessly\nmutilated, and the sale of it spoiled. She was disposed to present\nherself to the artful girl, and soundly lecture her for the deceit and\nwickedness: but she wanted to see how the game was played.\n\n\"Boo, hoo, hoo!\" sobbed Ann Grippen, apparently suffering all the pangs\nof a broken heart, which could not possibly be repaired.\n\n\"What is the matter, little girl?\" asked a benevolent lady, attracted\nby the distress of Ann.\n\n\"Boo, hoo, hoo!\" cried Ann, unable to speak on account of the torrents\nof wo that overwhelmed her.\n\n\"Don't cry, little girl, and tell me what the matter is,\" continued the\nkind lady.\n\n\"Boo, hoo, hoo! I fell down and broke all my candy,\" sobbed Ann.\n\n\"Poor child!\" exclaimed the sympathizing lady.\n\n\"My father'll beat me because I didn't sell it,\" added Ann.\n\n\"He is a cruel man. Are you sure he will punish you?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" groaned Ann. \"He'll whip me almost to death if I don't\nbring home half a dollar.\"\n\n\"You can tell him you fell down and broke the candy,\" suggested the\nlady.\n\n\"He won't believe me; he'll say I sold the candy and spent the money.\nO, dear me.\"\n\n\"You can show him the pieces.\"\n\n\"Boo, hoo, hoo! Then he'll say I broke it on purpose, because I was too\nlazy to sell it; and then he'll kill me--I know he will.\"\n\n\"I will go and see him, and tell him about the accident. Where do you\nlive?\"\n\n\"Down North Square. He ain't to home now,\" replied Ann, who was not\nquite prepared for this method of treating the subject.\n\n\"Poor child! I pity you,\" sighed the lady.\n\n\"O, dear me!\" cried Ann, exerting herself to the utmost to deepen the\nimpression she had made.\n\n\"How much do you want to make up the value of your candy?\"\n\n\"Half a dollar.\"\n\n\"There it is, poor child! If it will save you from abuse, you are\nwelcome to it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am. It may save my life,\" replied Ann, as she took the\nhalf dollar and put it in her pocket.\n\n\"What an awful liar she is!\" said Katy to herself, as the lady hurried\non, probably much pleased with herself as she thought of the kind act\nshe supposed she had done.\n\nKaty was curious to know what her unworthy assistant would do next, and\nshe followed her down Hanover Street, and saw her stop before the\nAmerican House. She could not believe that Ann would have the hardihood\nto play off the same trick again so soon; and she was very much\nsurprised and very indignant when she saw her begin to cry with all her\nmight, just as she had done before. While the deceitful girl's eyes\nwere covered with her apron, in the extremity of her grief, Katy\ncontrived to get on the hotel steps behind her, so that she could see\nand hear all that passed.\n\n\"What is the matter with that girl?\" asked a gentleman, who presently\nappeared at the door, addressing another who was just behind him.\n\n\"It is the broken candy dodge,\" replied the second gentleman. \"That\ntrick has been played off a dozen times within a week.\"\n\n\"What does it mean?\" asked the first. \"I don't understand it.\"\n\nThe second explained the trick, precisely as Katy had just witnessed it\nin Court Street.\n\n\"Now, don't say a word,\" he continued. \"I have a counterfeit half\ndollar in my pocket, and you shall see how it is done.\"\n\nWith this announcement of his purpose, he accosted Ann, who told him\nabout the same story she had told the lady, and he finally gave her the\ncounterfeit half dollar, which Ann did not suspect was a bad one.\n\n\"How abominably wicked she is,\" exclaimed Katy, as she followed her up\nthe street. \"But I will soon spoil all her fun, and cut off her\nprofits. I will teach her that honesty is the best policy.\"\n\nIt was easier for Katy to resolve what to do than it was to do it; for\nthe wicked girl could easily get her stock through another person. As\nshe walked up the street, Ann lightened her load by eating the pieces\nof broken candy, upon which she seemed to feed with hearty relish. At a\nwindow in Court Street, Ann stopped to look at some pictures, when she\nwas joined by another of the candy sellers, and they walked together\ntill they came to an unfrequented court, which they entered. Katy could\nhear enough of their conversation, as she followed them, to ascertain\nthat they were talking about the tricks Ann had practiced. In the court\nthey seated themselves on a door-stone, and as they talked and laughed\nabout the deceit, they ate the pieces of candy.\n\n\"There,\" said Ann, \"I have made a dollar and ten cents this afternoon.\nYou don't catch me walking all over the city for twenty-four cents,\nwhen I don't get but eight of that.\"\n\n\"I ain't so smart as you,\" modestly replied Julia Morgan, the other\ngirl.\n\n\"You'll learn,\" said Ann, as she took out her money and exhibited the\ntwo half dollars.\n\n\"I don't think people would believe me, if I should try that game.\"\n\n\"Try some other. I think I shall, for I've about used up the broken\ncandy game.\"\n\n\"What other?\"\n\n\"I have one,\" replied Ann, prudently declining to divulge her secret;\n\"and when I've tried it, I'll tell you all about it.\"\n\n\"Why don't you try it now?\"\n\n\"I would if my candy wasn't broken.\"\n\n\"I will let you have mine.\"\n\n\"Then I will.\"\n\n\"Give me fourteen cents.\"\n\n\"I will when I've done with it.\"\n\n\"No, you don't,\" laughed Julia, who justly inferred that if Ann would\ncheat one person, she would another.\n\nBut Ann was so much interested in the experiment that she decided to\ngive the fourteen cents, and took the candy. Katy wondered what the new\ngame could be, and wanted to see her carry it out, though her\nconscience smote her for permitting the lady to be deceived, when she\ncould have unmasked the deceit. She resolved not to let another person\nbe deceived, and followed the two girls into State Street, as much for\nthe purpose of exposing Ann's wickedness, as to learn the trick she\nintended to play.\n\n\"Now you go away,\" said Ann to her companion, as she placed herself on\nthe steps of the Merchants-Bank.\n\nIt was nearly dark by this time, and as there were but few persons in\nthe street, Ann did not commence her part of the performance till she\nsaw a well-dressed gentleman approach; whereupon she began to cry as\nshe had done twice before that day.\n\n\"Boo, hoo, hoo! O, dear me! I shall be killed!\" cried she, so lustily,\nthat the well-dressed gentleman could not decently avoid inquiring the\ncause of her bitter sorrow.\n\n\"I haven't sold out,\" sobbed Ann.\n\n\"What if you haven't? Why need you cry about it?\" asked the stranger.\n\n\"My mother will kill me if I go home without half a dollar.\"\n\n\"She is a cruel woman, then.\"\n\n\"Boo, hoo, hoo! She'll beat me to death! O, dear me! I only got ten\ncents.\"\n\n\"Why don't you fly round and sell your candy?\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"I can't now, the folks have all gone, and it's almost dark. O, I wish\nI was dead!\"\n\n\"Well, well, don't cry any more; I'll give you half a dollar, and that\nwill make it all right;\" and he put his hand in his pocket for the\nmoney.\n\n\"Don't give it to her,\" said Katy, stepping out of the lane by the side\nof the bank. \"She has deceived you, sir.\"\n\n\"Deceived me, has she?\" added the stranger as he glanced at Katy.\n\n\"Yes, sir. She has got more than a dollar in her pocket now.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe her,\" sobbed Ann, still prudently keeping up the\nappearance of grief.\n\n\"How do you know she has deceived me?\" asked the stranger, not a little\npiqued, as he thought how readily he had credited the girl's story.\n\n\"Because I saw her play a trick just like this twice before this\nafternoon. She has two half dollars in her pocket now, though one of\nthem is counterfeit.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, Katy Redburn?\" demanded Ann, angrily, and\nnow forgetting her woe and her tears.\n\n\"You speak very positively,\" said the gentleman to Katy; \"and if what\nyou say is true, something should be done about it.\"\n\n\"She is telling lies!\" exclaimed Ann, much excited.\n\n\"We can soon determine, for here comes a policeman, and I will refer\nthe matter to him.\"\n\nAt these words, Ann edged off the steps of the bank, and suddenly\nstarted off as fast as she could run, having, it seemed, a very\nwholesome aversion to policemen. But she made a bad mistake, for, not\nseeing in what direction the officer was approaching, she ran into the\nvery jaws of the lion.\n\n\"Stop her!\" shouted the gentleman.\n\nThe policeman laid a rude hand upon her shoulder, and marched her back\nto the bank. In a few words the gentleman stated what had happened, and\nrequested the officer to search her, and thus decide whether Katy told\nthe truth or not. He readily consented, and on turning out Ann's\npocket, produced the two half dollars, one of which the gentleman\ndecided was a counterfeit coin.\n\n\"How could you know this was a counterfeit?\" he asked of Katy.\n\n\"I heard a gentleman at the door of the American House, who knew the\ngame, tell another that it was a counterfeit;\" and she proceeded to\ngive all the particulars of the two tricks she had seen Ann play off.\n\n\"I shall have to take you to the lock-up, my little joker,\" said the\npoliceman.\n\n\"O, dear me!\" cried Ann, and this time she was in earnest.\n\n\"Please don't do that!\" said Katy, who had not foreseen this\nconsequence of the game.\n\n\"I must; it is downright swindling.\"\n\n\"Please don't; she has a father and mother and I dare say they will\nfeel very bad about it. I promise you she shall never do it again,\"\npleaded Katy.\n\n\"I must do my duty. This candy trick has been played a good many times,\nand has become a nuisance. I must lock her up.\"\n\n\"Save me, Katy, save me!\" begged Ann terrified at the thought of being\nput in a prison or some dreadful place.\n\n\"Why do you wish to save her?\" interposed the gentleman.\n\n\"Because her mother will feel so bad; and she will lay it all to me.\"\n\nKaty told him all about herself and about Ann, and he was so much\ninterested in her that he joined in pleading for Ann's release. The\nofficer was firm for a long time, but when the gentleman declared that\nhe should not appear against her, he decided to let her go, to Katy's\ngreat delight, as well as to Ann's.\n\nHumbled by the peril from which she had just escaped, Ann promised\nnever to be guilty of playing another trick upon travelers; but Katy\nwas firm in her purpose not to supply her with any more candy. She did\nnot dare to resent Katy's interference, for the terrors of the lock-up\nwere still in her mind, and she did not know but that Katy might have\nher arrested and punished for what she had done, if she attempted to\nretaliate upon her.\n\nKaty was shocked at the wickedness of her companion; and, as they\nwalked home together she tried to make her see the enormity of her\noffense, and give her some better views of her duty to her\nfellow-beings. Ann heard her in silence and with humility, and the\nlittle moralist hoped the event would result in good to her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTHE SUN SETS, AND THE NIGHT COMES ON.\n\nHaving recorded the steps by which Katy had carried forward her now\nflourishing trade, from the dawn of the idea up to the height of its\nprosperity, we may pass over a year with only a brief note of its\nprincipal incidents.\n\nMy young readers may have supposed that Katy and her mother had\ngathered a great deal of money in the candy trade. It was not so, for\nas the business increased, and Katy's labors as a saleswoman were\nwithdrawn, the expenses increased, and the profits were proportionally\nless. And then, neither Mrs. Redburn nor her daughter had a faculty for\nsaving up much money; so that, though they made  considerable, their\nprosperity permitted new demands to be made upon the purse. They hired\ntwo more rooms; they replaced the clothing and furniture which had been\nsacrificed under the pressure of actual want, and they lived better\nthan they had lived before; and Mrs. Redburn had availed herself of the\nservices of a distinguished physician, whose attendance had cost a\nlarge sum. It is true they lived very well, much better than people in\ntheir circumstances ought to have lived. Therefore, notwithstanding\ntheir prosperity, they had saved but a small sum from the proceeds of\nthe year's business. They were not rich; they were simply in\ncomfortable circumstances, which, considering their situation when Katy\ncommenced business, was quite enough to render them very thankful to\nthe Giver of all good for the rich blessings He had bestowed upon them.\n\nThese were not all temporal blessings; if they had been, their success\nwould only have been partial and temporary, their prosperity only an\noutward seeming, which, in the truest and highest sense, can hardly be\ncalled prosperity; no more than if a man should gain a thousand dollars\nworth of land, and lose a thousand dollars worth of stocks or\nmerchandise. Both Katy and her mother, while they were gathering the\ntreasures of this world, were also \"laying up treasures in heaven,\nwhere neither moth nor rust doth corrupt.\" Want had taught them its\nhard lessons, and they had come out of the fiery furnace of affliction\nthe wiser and the better for the severe ordeal. The mother's foolish\npride had been rebuked, the daughter's true pride had been encouraged.\nThey had learned that faith and patience are real supports in the hour\nof trial. The perilous life in the streets which Katy had led for a\ntime, exposed her to a thousand temptations; and she and her mother\nthanked God that they had made her stronger and truer, as temptation\nresisted always makes the soul. That year of experience had given Katy\na character; it expanded her views of life, and placed her in a\nsituation where she was early called upon to decide between the right\nand the wrong; when she was required to select her path for life. She\nhad chosen the good way, as Ann Grippen had chosen the evil way.\n\nI do not mean to say her character was formed, or that having chosen to\nbe good, she could not afterwards be evil. But the great experiences of\nlife which generally come in more mature years, had been forced upon\nher while still a child; and nobly and truly had she taken up and borne\nthe burden imposed upon her. As a child she had done the duties of the\nfull-grown woman, and she had done them well. She had been faithful to\nherself.\n\nProvidence kindly ordains that the child shall serve a long\napprenticeship before it is called upon to think and act for itself.\nKaty had anticipated the period of maturity, and with the untried soul\nof a child, had been compelled to grapple with its duties and its\ntemptations. As her opportunities to be good and do good were\nincreased, so was her liability to do wrong. She had her faults, great,\ngrave faults, but she was truly endeavoring to overcome them.\n\nTommy had returned from his voyage to Liverpool, and joyous was the\nmeeting between Katy and her sailor friend. It took him all the\nevenings for a week to tell the story of his voyage, to which Mrs.\nRedburn and her daughter listened with much satisfaction. He remained\nat home two months, and then departed on a voyage to the East Indies.\n\nMaster Simon Sneed, after Katy's attempt to serve him, did not tell her\nmany more large stories about himself, for she understood him now, and\nknew that he was not half so great a man as he pretended to be. In the\nspring he obtained a situation in a small retail store where there was\nnot a very wide field for the exercise of his splendid abilities. He\nhad been idle all winter, and when he lamented his misfortunes to Katy,\nshe always asked why he did not sell candy. Once she suggested that he\nshould learn a trade, to which Master Simon always replied, that he was\nborn to be a gentleman, and would never voluntarily demean himself by\npursuing a degrading occupation. He was above being a mechanic, and he\nwould never soil his hands with dirty work. Katy began to think he was\nreally a fool. She could scarcely think him \"poor and proud\"; he was\nonly poor and foolish.\n\nAt the close of Katy's first year in trade, a great misfortune befell\nher in the loss of Mrs. Colvin, her able assistant in the manufacturing\ndepartment of the business. A worthy man, who owned a little farm in\nthe country, tempted her with an offer of marriage, and her conscience\n(I suppose) would not let her refuse it. Katy, though she was a woman,\nso far as the duties and responsibilities of life were concerned, was\nstill a child in her feelings and affections, and cried bitterly when\nthey parted. The good woman was scarcely less affected, and made Katy\nand her mother promise an early visit to her farm.\n\nKaty's sorrow at parting with her beloved friend was not the only, nor\nperhaps, the most important, result of Mrs. Colvin's departure, for\nthey were deprived of the assistance of the chief candy-puller. Katy\ntried to secure another woman for this labor, but could not find a\nperson who would serve her in this capacity. After a vain search, Mrs.\nRedburn thought she was able to do the work herself, for her health\nseemed to be pretty well established. Perhaps, she reasoned, it was\nquite as well that Mrs. Colvin had gone, for if she could pull the\ncandy herself, it would save from two to three dollars a week.\n\nKaty would not consent that she should do it alone, but agreed to\ndivide the labor between them. The quantity manufactured every day was\nso great that the toil of making it fell heavily upon them; but as Mrs.\nRedburn did not complain, Katy was too proud to do so though her wrists\nand shoulders pained her severely every night after the work was done.\n\nThis toil weighed heavily on Katy's rather feeble constitution; but all\nher mother could say would not induce her to abandon the work. For a\nmonth they got along tolerably well, and, perhaps, no evil consequences\nwould have followed this hard labor, if everything else had gone well\nwith Katy. The girls who sold the candy had for some time caused her\nconsiderable trouble and anxiety. Very often they lost their money, or\npretended to do so, and three or four of them had resorted to Ann\nGrippen's plan of playing \"trick upon travelers.\" She had to discharge\na great many, and to accept the services of those whom she did not\nknow, and who, by various means, contrived to cheat her out of the\nmoney received from the sales of the candy. These things annoyed her\nvery much, and she cast about her for a remedy.\n\nOne day, three girls, each of whom had been supplied with half a\ndollar's worth of candy, did not appear to account for the proceeds.\nHere was a loss of a dollar in one day. Such things as these are the\ncommon trials of business; but Katy who was so scrupulously honest and\njust herself, was severely tried by them. It was not the loss of the\nmoney only, but the dishonesty of the girls that annoyed her.\n\n\"What shall be done, mother?\" said she, anxiously, when the loss was\nunderstood to be actual. \"I can't find these girls. I don't even know\ntheir names.\"\n\n\"Probably, if you did find them, you could not obtain any satisfaction.\"\n\n\"I went to see one girl's mother the other day, you know, and she drove\nme out of her house, and called me vile names.\"\n\n\"I was thinking of a plan,\" continued Mrs. Redburn, \"though I don't\nknow as it would work well.\"\n\n\"Anything would work better than this being constantly cheated; for it\nis really worse for the girls than it is for us. I have often felt that\nthose who cheat us are the real sufferers. I would a good deal rather\nbe cheated than cheat myself.\"\n\n\"You are right, Katy; and that is a Christian view of the subject. I\nsuppose we are in duty bound to keep these girls as honest as we can.\"\n\n\"What is your plan, mother?\" asked Katy.\n\n\"We will sell them the candy, instead of employing them to sell it for\nus.\"\n\n\"But they won't pay us.\"\n\n\"Let them pay in advance. We will sell them the candy at eight cents a\ndozen. Any girl who wants two dozen sticks, must bring sixteen cents.\"\n\n\"I don't believe we can find any customers.\"\n\n\"We can try it. For a time, probably, the sales will be less.\"\n\n\"Very well, mother, we will try it; for I think it would be better to\nkeep them honest, even if we don't sell more than half so much.\"\n\nWhen the girls appeared the next morning to receive their stock, it was\nannounced to them that the business would thereafter be conducted on a\ndifferent basis; that they must pay for their candy before they got it,\nand thus become independent merchants themselves. Most of them were\nunable to comply with the terms, and begged hard to be trusted one day\nmore. Katy was firm, for she saw that they would be more likely to be\ndishonest that day, to revenge themselves for the working of the new\nsystem.\n\nThe girls were not all dishonest, or even a majority of them, but the\nplan must be applied to all. Most of them went home, therefore, and\nshortly returned with money enough to buy one or two dozen sticks. As\nMrs. Redburn had predicted, the effect of the adoption of the new plan\nwas unfavorable for a few days. The obstinate ones would not buy,\nhoping to make the wholesale dealer go back to the old plan. After a\nweek or two, however, they began to come back, one by one, and the\ntrade rather increased than diminished; for many of the young\nmerchants, having the responsibility of selling out all the stock\nimposed upon them, used greater exertion than before, and strong\nefforts almost always produced some success.\n\nThus the business went on very prosperously though Mrs. Redburn and\nKaty were obliged to work very hard--so hard that the former began to\nexperience a return of her old complaint. The affectionate daughter was\nfrightened when she first mentioned the fact, and begged her not to\nwork any more.\n\n\"What shall I do, Katy?\" asked she, with a smile.\n\n\"Let me make the candy,\" replied Katy. \"I am strong enough.\"\n\n\"No, Katy, you are not. I am afraid you are injuring yourself now.\"\n\n\"I am sure I am not. But I can't bear to think of your being sick\nagain.\"\n\n\"We must look out for our health, Katy; that ought to be the first of\nour earthly considerations.\"\n\n\"We ought, indeed, mother; so, if you please, I shall not let you pull\nany more candy.\"\n\n\"Shall I save my own health at the expense of yours?\"\n\n\"I shall get along very well. I feel very strong.\"\n\n\"You are not very strong; I have reproached myself a great many times\nfor letting you do so much as you have. I have felt the pain for a\nfortnight, and though I greatly fear I shall have a return of my\ncomplaint, I cannot let you do all this work. We are neither of us fit\nto perform such hard labor and both of us must be relieved from it. I\nshall go out to-morrow, and make a business of finding a person to do\nthis work for us.\"\n\nMrs. Redburn did try, but she tried in vain. It was odd, queer strange\nwork, as the women called it, and they didn't want to do anything of\nthe kind. Katy proposed that they should employ a man; and when they\nfinally found one, he was a stupid fellow, and they much preferred to\ndo the work themselves, to seeing him daub the house all over with the\ncandy, and leave it half done.\n\nThey persevered, however, in their efforts to find a person, and after\ntrying half a dozen, who could not or would not do the work, they gave\nit up in despair. But not long were they permitted to struggle with the\nsevere toil which their circumstances imposed upon them; for on the\nnight before Christmas, when a large demand for candy was anticipated,\nand both of them had worked very hard, Mrs. Redburn fainted and fell\nupon the floor. It was in this manner that she had been taken at the\ncommencement of her former long sickness, and to Katy the future looked\ndark and gloomy. But she did not give up. She applied herself, with all\nher energies, to the restoration of her mother; and when she was\npartially conscious, she attempted to conduct her to the bed. The poor\nwoman's strength was all gone, and Katy was obliged to call in Mrs.\nHoward to assist her.\n\nMrs. Redburn suffered the most severe and racking pains through the\nnight, and at about twelve o'clock, Katy went to Mr. Sneed's house, and\ncalling up Simon, begged him to go for a doctor. But the physician's\nart seemed powerless to soothe her. All night long the devoted\ndaughter, like an angel of mercy, hovered around the bed, and did all\nhe could in vain attempts to ease the sufferer's pain.\n\nPoor Katy! The sun of prosperity had set, and the night of adversity\nwas coming on.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nKATY STRUGGLES BRAVELY THROUGH A SERIES OF TRIALS.\n\nThe morning sun rose clear and bright, casting a flood of light into\nthe chamber of the sick mother, watched over by the beloved child. It\nwas Christmas, and all over the Christian world arose paeans of praise\nfor the birth of the Saviour. The sufferer was conscious of the fact,\nand a sweet smile played upon her lips, as she thought of Jesus--that\nhe had lived and died for her. Pain, that could rack the bones and\ntriumph over the weak body, was powerless to subdue the loving,\ntrusting spirit, that reposed gently on Him who has invited the weary\nto a present and an eternal rest.\n\n\"Katy,\" said Mrs. Redburn, in a faint whisper.\n\n\"I am here, mother,\" replied she, bending over her and endeavoring to\nanticipate her unspoken desire.\n\n\"Is the hymn book on the table?\"\n\n\"Here it is, mother.\"\n\n\"Won't you read me a hymn?\"\n\n\"What shall I read?\" asked Katy, who could with difficulty keep back\nthe flood of tears that rose up from her heart.\n\n\"'Come, said Jesus' sacred voice.'\"\n\nKaty opened the book to the beautiful hymn commencing with this line,\nand in a voice broken by the emotion she could not wholly control, she\nread it through. The smile that played on her mother's face showed how\ndeep and pure was the consolation she derived from the touching poetry.\nShe could smile while racking pains tortured her frame, while her frail\nbody seemed hardly to retain its hold upon mortality. How blessed the\nhope that pours its heavenly balm into the wounds of the sufferer!\n\nPoor Katy was painfully impressed by the appearance and conduct of her\nmother. She had never before seen her so calm and resigned to those\ndreadful sufferings. She had heard her complain and murmur at her hard\nlot, and wonder why she should be thus sorely afflicted. She feared\nthat some appalling event, which she dared not define and call by its\nname, was about to happen. She dared not think of the future, and she\nwondered that her mother could be so calm while she endured so much.\n\n\"Katy,\" said Mrs. Redburn, after the long silence that followed the\nreading of the hymn, \"I feel very weak and ill. Take my hand.\"\n\n\"You are burning up with fever!\" exclaimed Katy, as she clasped the\nhand, and felt the burning, throbbing brow of her mother.\n\n\"I am; but do not be alarmed, Katy. Can you be very calm?\"\n\n\"I will try.\"\n\n\"For I feel very sick, but I am very happy. I can almost believe that\nthe triumph of faith has already begun in my soul. The world looks very\ndim to me.\"\n\n\"Nay, mother, don't say so.\"\n\n\"I only mean that as heaven seems nearer, my hold upon earth is less\nstrong. You must be very resolute, my child, for I feel as though the\nsands of life were fast ebbing out; and that in a few hours more I\nshall be 'where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at\nrest.' If it were not for leaving you, Katy, I could wish to bid\nfarewell to earth, and go up to my eternal home, even on this bright,\nbeautiful Christmas day.\"\n\n\"O mother!\" sobbed Katy, unable any longer to restrain the expression\nof her emotion.\n\n\"Do not weep, my child; I may be mistaken; yet I feel as though God was\nabout to end my sufferings on earth, and I am willing to go.\"\n\n\"O, no, mother! It cannot be!\" exclaimed Katy, gazing earnestly,\nthrough her tearful eyes, upon the pale but flushed cheek of the\npatient sufferer.\n\n\"I only wish to prepare you for the worst. I may get well; and for your\nsake, I have prayed that I may. And, Katy, I have never before felt\nprepared to leave this world, full of trial and sorrow as it has been\nfor me. Whatever of woe, and want, and disappointment it has been my\nlot to confront, has been a blessing in disguise. I feel like a new\ncreature. I feel reconciled to live or die, as God ordains.\"\n\n\"Do not look on the dark side, mother,\" sobbed Katy.\n\n\"Nay, child, I am looking on the bright side,\" returned Mrs. Redburn,\nfaintly. \"Everything looks bright to me now. Life looks bright, and I\nfeel that I could be happy for many years with you, for you have been a\ngood daughter. Death looks bright, for it is the portal of the temple\neternal in the heavens, where is joy unspeakable. I am too weak to talk\nmore, Katy; you may read me a chapter from the New Testament.\"\n\nThe devoted daughter obeyed this request, and she had scarcely finished\nthe chapter before the girls came for their candy. She was unwilling to\nleave her mother alone even for a minute; so she sent one of them over\nto request the attendance of Mrs. Howard, and the good woman took her\nplace by the side of the sufferer.\n\nKaty, scarcely conscious what she was doing--for her heart was with her\nmother,--supplied each girl with her stock of candy, and received the\nmoney for it.\n\n\"You need not come to-morrow,\" she said to them, as they were departing.\n\n\"Not come!\" exclaimed several. \"What shall we do for candy?\"\n\n\"We cannot make any now; my mother is very sick.\"\n\n\"I get my living by selling candy,\" said one of them. \"I shan't have\nanything to pay my board if I can't sell candy.\"\n\n\"Poor Mary! I am sorry for you.\"\n\nThis girl was an orphan whose mother had recently died, and she had\ntaken up the business of selling candy, which enabled her to pay fifty\ncents a week for her board, at the house of a poor widow. Katy knew her\nhistory, and felt very sad as she thought of her being deprived of the\nmeans of support.\n\n\"I don't know what I shall do,\" sighed Mary.\n\n\"I have to take care of my mother now, and shall not have time to make\ncandy,\" said Katy.\n\n\"Do you mean to give up for good?\" asked one of them.\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nThis question suggested some painful reflections to Katy. If they\nstopped making candy, she and her mother, as well as orphan Mary, would\nbe deprived of the means of support. She trembled as she thought of the\nfuture, even when she looked forward only a few weeks. There was not\nmore than ten dollars in the house, for they had but a short time\nbefore paid for their winter's coal, and at considerable expense\nlargely replenished their wardrobes. The rent would be due in a week,\nand it would require more than half they had to pay it.\n\nKaty was appalled as she thought of the low state of their purse, and\ndreaded lest some fearful calamity might again overtake them. It was\nplain to her that she could not give up her business, even for a week,\nwithout the danger of being again reduced to actual want. She therefore\nreversed her decision, and told the girls they might come as usual the\nnext day.\n\nWhen they had gone she shed a few bitter tears at the necessity which\nthe circumstances imposed upon her of working while her heart revolted\nat the idea of being anywhere but at the bedside of her sick mother.\nThen she lamented that they had not dispensed with many articles of\nluxury while they had plenty of money, and saved more of it for such a\nsad time as the present. But it was of no use to repine; she had only\nto make the best of her situation.\n\nAmid all these discouragements came a bright ray of sunshine--the\nbrightest that could possibly have shone on the pathway of the weeping\ndaughter.\n\nEarly in the forenoon came the physician who carefully examined his\npatient, speaking cheerfully and kindly to her all the while. The\nsufferer watched his expression very narrowly, as he bent over her and\nquestioned her in regard to her pains. He looked very serious, which\nMrs. Redburn interpreted as unfavorable to her recovery, not\nconsidering that he was engaged in profound thought, and therefore his\ncountenance would naturally wear an earnest look. Presently she sent\nKaty to get her some drink, not because she wanted it, but to procure\nher absence for a short time.\n\n\"Do you think I shall get well?\" asked Mrs. Redburn, as soon as the\ndoor closed behind Katy.\n\n\"A person who is very sick, is of course, always in danger, which may\nbe more or less imminent,\" replied the doctor, with professional\nindirectness.\n\n\"I beg of you, doctor, do not conceal from me my true situation.\"\n\n\"I cannot foresee the result, my good woman.\"\n\n\"Do you think there is any hope for me?\"\n\n\"Certainly there is.\"\n\n\"Tell me, I implore you, what you think of my case,\" pleaded the\nsufferer, in feeble tones. \"I felt this morning that my end was very\nnear.\"\n\n\"O, no; it is not so bad as that. I should say you had as many as five\nchances in ten to be on your feet in a fortnight.\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"I do not regard your case as a critical one.\"\n\n\"I wish you had told me so last night. It would have saved my poor\nchild a very bitter pang.\"\n\n\"I was not aware that you thought yourself alarmingly sick, or I\ncertainly should; for such an opinion on your part would do more to\nbring about a fatal result than could be counteracted by the most\nskilful treatment. A physician does not hold the issues of life and\ndeath; he can only assist nature, as the patient may by a cheerful view\nof his case. This is not your old complaint; you have taken cold, and\nhave considerable fever; but I think it is a very hopeful case.\"\n\nThe return of Katy interrupted the conversation; but the doctor's\nopinion was immediately imparted to her, and it sent a thrill of joy to\nher heart.\n\n\"I was low-spirited this morning, Katy,\" said Mrs. Redburn, when the\nphysician had gone. \"I really felt as though my end was rapidly\napproaching. I am sorry I mentioned my thoughts to you.\"\n\n\"It was all for the best, I suppose,\" replied Katy.\n\nBut Mrs. Redburn was very sick; and even now the disease might have a\nfatal termination. The best of care would be required to restore her to\nhealth, and Katy was very anxious. Her mother was still suffering the\nmost acute pain.\n\nThe doctor had left a prescription, and Katy was again obliged to call\nin Mrs. Howard while she went to the apothecary's to procure it; but\nthe good woman declared she was glad to come, and would bring her work\nand stay all the forenoon. The medicine, when obtained, to some extent\nrelieved the sufferer's pain.\n\nAs her presence was not required in the chamber, Katy went down-stairs\nto what she called the candy room. She had an hour or two to spare, and\nshe put on the kettle with the intention of making a part of the next\nday's candy. She was nearly worn out by watching and anxiety, and not\nfit to perform such hard work; but weak and weary as she felt, her\nspirit was still earnest, and she resolutely commenced her labors.\n\nAt noon she had made half the quantity required. Mrs. Howard was then\nobliged to go home, and attend to her own family, for she had two\nchildren besides Tommy, who had not yet returned from the East Indies.\nMrs. Redburn was very restless during the afternoon, and could not be\nleft alone for more than a short time at once. Mrs. Howard had promised\nto come again in the evening, and make the rest of the candy; but\nCharley came home from school quite sick, seemingly threatened with the\nscarlet fever, so that she could not keep her promise. Mrs. Sneed,\nhowever, dropped in, and consented to remain for two hours, which\nenabled Katy to make the rest of the candy.\n\nBy this time the poor girl was completely worn out. Her resolute will,\neven, could no longer impart its strength to the body. Her mother\nworried sadly about her, and finally induced her to lie down on the bed\nby her side, on condition that she should be awakened in an hour. In\nthis manner she obtained a few hours' sleep during the night; but these\nsevere labors were a fearful task to be imposed upon a mere child.\n\nThe next day Mrs. Redburn, who could not fail to observe Katy's pale\nface and sunken eye, fretted so much about her that she was obliged to\npromise she would not attempt to make any more candy. Mrs. Howard's son\nwas still very sick, so that she was unable to render much assistance.\nThe rest of the neighbors, though kindly disposed, had their own\nfamilies to care for, and could do very little for others.\n\nWith what slight aid her friends could afford, Katy struggled through a\nweek, when Dr. Flynch appeared, and demanded the rent. There was but\nlittle more than money enough left to pay it, but Katy would not ask\nhim for any indulgence, and paid him in full.\n\nIn a few days more the purse was empty. Katy's most dreaded hour had\ncome. She had no money, and almost every day some new thing was\nrequired for her mother. But this time she had friends, and she\ndetermined to use them, as all true friends wish to be used in the day\nof sorrow and trial. After considerable debate with herself, she\ndecided to apply to Mrs. Gordon for a loan of twenty dollars. She was\nstill poor and proud, and she could not endure the thought of asking a\nloan, which might be regarded as a gift, or which, by her own inability\nto pay it, might virtually become such; therefore she proposed to\npresent her father's silver watch as security for the payment of the\ndebt.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nKATY RESORTS TO A LOAN.\n\nKaty was not at all pleased with the mission which her duty seemed to\nimpose upon her. Again she felt the crushing weight of poverty, and\npride rose up to throw obstacles in her path. She was a child of\ntwelve, and to ask a loan of twenty dollars, though she offered\nsufficient security for the payment of the debt, seemed like demanding\na great deal of her friends--like inviting them to repose a vast amount\nof confidence in her ability and honesty. They would not want the\nwatch; it would be of no value to them; and the more she considered the\nmatter, the more like an act of charity appeared the favor she was\nabout to ask.\n\nMore than once on her way to Temple Street did she stop short, resolved\nto get the money of some other person--the grocer, Mr. Sneed, or even\nof a pawnbroker; but as often she rebuked the pride that tormented her\nlike a demon, and went forward again. She stood some time at Mrs.\nGordon's door before she had the resolution to ring the bell.\n\n\"What right have I to be so proud?\" said she, grasping the bell handle.\n\"I must get this money, or my mother may suffer.\"\n\nShe rang with a force that must have astonished Michael, and led him to\nthink some extraordinary character had arrived; for he ran to the door\nat full speed, and burst out into a violent fit of laughter, when he\nsaw no one but the little candy merchant.\n\n\"Good morning, to you, Katy. Are you nervous this morning?\" said he.\n\n\"Good morning, Michael. I am not very nervous.\"\n\n\"I thought you would pull down the bell,\" he added, good-naturedly.\n\n\"I didn't mean to, Michael; I hope you will excuse me if I did any\nharm.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of harm; but you're looking as sober as a deacon. What ails\nyou, Katy?\"\n\n\"I feel very sad, Michael; for my mother is very sick, and I don't know\nas she will ever get well.\"\n\n\"Indeed? I'm sorry to hear that of her;\" and Michael, whatever he felt,\nlooked very much concerned about Mrs. Redburn's health.\n\n\"Is Mrs. Gordon at home?\"\n\n\"She isn't.\"\n\n\"Is Miss Grace?\"\n\n\"Neither of them; they went to Baltimore ten days ago but I am\nexpecting them back every day.\"\n\nKaty's heart sank within her; for now that Mrs. Gordon was not at hand,\nshe did not feel like asking any other person; and if the case had not\nbeen urgent, she would have been satisfied to return home, and regard\nthe lady's absence as a sufficient excuse for not procuring the money.\n\n\"You want to see her very much?\" asked Michael.\n\n\"Very much, indeed.\"\n\n\"Can I be of any service to you?\"\n\n\"No, Michael.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I can, Katy.\"\n\n\"No, I'm much obliged to you.\"\n\n\"If it's anything in the house you want, I can get it for you.\"\n\n\"No, I must see Mrs. Gordon.\"\n\n\"If it's any nice preserve or jelly you want just say the word, and\nI'll bring it to you at once.\"\n\n\"I do not want anything of that kind. Do you think Mrs. Gordon will\nreturn by to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I thought she would be here yesterday, and she may come to-night.\"\n\n\"Very well; I will, perhaps, call again to-morrow,\" and she turned to\nleave.\n\n\"I'll tell Mrs. Gordon you came. Stop a minute, Katy. Won't you tell me\nwhat you want?\"\n\n\"I would rather not, Michael; but I will come again to-morrow.\"\n\n\"See here, Katy; maybe you're short of money. If you are, I have a\nmatter of three hundred dollars in the Savings Bank; and you may be\nsure you shall have every cent of it if you want it.\"\n\nThis was a very liberal offer, though it is probable he did not think\nshe would want any considerable portion of it, or that she could even\ncomprehend the meaning of so large a sum. Katy was sorely tempted to\nnegotiate with him for the loan but she was not sure that it would be\nproper to borrow money of the servant, and perhaps Mrs. Gordon would\nnot like it.\n\n\"I thank you, Michael; you are very kind, but I think I would rather\nsee Mrs. Gordon.\"\n\n\"I have a matter of five or six dollars in my pocket now; and it\nthat'll be of any service to you, take it and welcome.\"\n\nKaty stopped to think. A few dollars would be all that she needed\nbefore the return of Mrs. Gordon; and yet she did not feel like\naccepting it. What would the lady say on her return, when told that she\nhad borrowed money of her servant? Yet the servant had a kind heart,\nand really desired to serve her. Was it not pride that prevented her\nfrom accepting his offer? Did she not feel too proud to place herself\nunder obligations to the servant? She felt rebuked at her presumption;\nfor what right had she to make such distinctions? If she had been a\nlady, like Mrs. Gordon, she might have been excusable for cherishing\nsuch pride; but she was a poor girl; she was actually in want.\n\n\"Michael, you are so good, that I will tell you my story,\" said she,\nconquering her repugnance.\n\n\"Just come in the house, then;\" and he led her into the sitting-room;\nbeing, in the absence of the mistress, the lord and master of the\nmansion, and feeling quite at home in that position.\n\nIn a few words she explained to him her situation, though her\nrebellious pride caused her to paint the picture in somewhat brighter\ncolors than the truth would justify. She stated her intention to borrow\ntwenty dollars of Mrs. Gordon, and offer her the watch as security, at\nthe same time exhibiting the cherished treasure.\n\n\"Now Michael, if you will lend me three dollars till Mrs. Gordon\nreturns, I will pay you then, for I know she will let me have the\nmoney; or at least let me have enough to pay you,\" continued she, when\nshe had finished her narrative.\n\n\"Indeed I will, Katy!\" exclaimed he, promptly pulling out his wallet.\n\"And if you will come at this time to-morrow, you shall have the whole\ntwenty dollars.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Michael.\"\n\n\"There's six dollars; take it, Katy, and my blessing with it.\"\n\n\"Only three dollars, Michael,\" replied Katy, firmly.\n\nMichael insisted, but all his persuasion would not induce her to accept\nmore than the sum she had mentioned, and he was reluctantly compelled\nto yield the point.\n\n\"Here is the watch, Michael; you shall keep that till I pay you.\"\n\n\"Is it me!\" exclaimed he, springing to his feet, with an expression\nvery like indignation on his countenance. \"Sure, you don't think I'd\ntake the watch.\"\n\n\"Why not you as well as Mrs. Gordon?\" asked Katy.\n\n\"She didn't take it,\" replied Michael triumphantly. \"You couldn't make\nher take it, if you try a month. Don't I know Mrs. Gordon?\"\n\n\"But please to take it; I should feel much better if you would.\"\n\n\"Bad luck to me if I do! I wouldn't take it to save my neck from the\ngallows. Where's my Irish heart? Did I leave it at home, or did I bring\nit with me to America?\"\n\n\"If you will not take it, Michael----\"\n\n\"I won't.\"\n\n\"If you won't, I will say no more about it,\" replied Katy, as she\nreturned the watch to her pocket. \"You have got a very kind heart, and\nI shall never forget you as long as I live.\"\n\nKaty, after glancing at the portrait of the roguish lady that hung in\nthe room, took leave of Michael, and hastened home. On her way, she\ncould not banish the generous servant from her mind. She could not\nunderstand why he should be so much interested in her as to offer the\nuse of all he had; and she was obliged to attribute it all to the\nimpulses of a kind heart. If she had been a little older, she might\nhave concluded that the old maxim, slightly altered would explain the\nreason: \"Like mistress, like man,\" that the atmosphere of kindness and\ncharity that pervaded the house had inspired even the servants.\n\n\"Where have you been, Katy?\" asked Mrs. Redburn, as she entered the\nsick chamber, and Mrs. Sneed hastened home.\n\n\"I have been to Mrs. Gordon.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nKaty did not like to tell. She knew it would make her mother feel very\nunhappy to know that she had borrowed money of Mrs. Gordon's servant.\n\n\"Oh, I went up to see her,\" replied Katy.\n\n\"No matter, if you don't like to tell me,\" faintly replied Mrs. Redburn.\n\n\"I will tell you, mother,\" answered Katy, stung by the gentle rebuke\ncontained in her mother's words.\n\n\"I suppose our money is all gone,\" sighed the sick woman.\n\n\"No, mother; see here! I have three dollars,\" and Katy pulled out her\nporte-monnaie, anxious to save her even a moment of uneasiness.\n\nBut in taking out the money she exhibited the watch also, which at once\nexcited Mrs. Redburn's curiosity.\n\n\"What have you been doing with that, Katy?\" she asked. \"Ah, I fear I\nwas right. We have no money! Our business is gone! Alas, we have\nnothing to hope for!\"\n\n\"O, no, mother, it is not half so bad as that!\" exclaimed Katy. \"I went\nup to Mrs. Gordon for the purpose of borrowing twenty dollars of her; I\ndidn't want it to look like charity, so I was going to ask her to keep\nthe watch till it was paid. That's all, mother.\"\n\n\"And she refused?\"\n\n\"No; she was not at home.\"\n\n\"But your money is not all gone?\"\n\nKaty wanted to say it was not, but her conscience would not let her\npractise deception. She had the three dollars which she had just\nborrowed of Michael, and that was not all gone. But this was not the\nquestion her mother asked, and it would be a lie to say the money was\nnot all gone, when she fully understood the meaning of the question.\nPerhaps it was for her mother's good to deceive her; but she had been\ntaught to feel that she had no right to do evil that good might follow.\n\n\"It was all gone, but I borrowed three dollars,\" she replied, after a\nlittle hesitation.\n\n\"Of whom?\"\n\n\"Of Michael.\"\n\n\"Who's he?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Gordon's man.\n\n\"O Katy! How could you do so?\" sighed Mrs. Redburn.\n\n\"I couldn't help it, mother. He would make me take it;\" and she gave\nall the particulars of her interview with Michael and reviewed the\nconsiderations which had induced her to accept the loan.\n\n\"Perhaps you are right, Katy. My pride would not have let me borrow of\na servant; but it is wicked for me to cherish such a pride. I try very\nhard to banish it.\"\n\n\"Don't talk any more now, mother. We are too poor to be too proud to\naccept a favor of one who is in a humble station.\" replied Katy.\n\n\"I don't know what will become of us,\" said Mrs. Redburn, as she turned\nher head away to hide the tears that flooded her eyes.\n\nKaty took up the Bible that lay by the bedside, and turning to the\ntwenty-third psalm, she read, \"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not\nwant. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside\nthe still waters.\"\n\n\"Go on, Katy; those words are real comfort,\" said Mrs. Redburn, drying\nher tears. \"I know it is wicked for me to repine.\"\n\nKaty read the whole psalm, and followed it with others, which produced\na healing influence upon her mother's mind, and she seemed to forget\nthat the purse was empty, and that they had placed themselves under\nobligations to a servant.\n\nThe sufferer rested much better than usual that night, and Katy was\npermitted to sleep the greater part of the time--a boon which her\nexhausted frame very much needed. About ten o'clock in the forenoon,\nMichael paid her a visit, to inform her that Mrs. Gordon had just\narrived: and that, when he mentioned her case, she had sent him down to\nrequest her immediate attendance and that his mistress would have come\nherself, only she was so much fatigued by her journey.\n\nKaty could not leave then, for she had no one to stay with her mother;\nbut Mrs. Sneed could come in an hour. Michael hastened home with the\nintelligence that Mrs. Redburn was better, and Katy soon followed him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nMRS. GORDON FEELS FAINT, AND KATY ENTERS A NEW SPHERE.\n\nOn her arrival at Temple Street, Katy was promptly admitted by Michael,\nand shown in the sitting-room, where Mrs. Gordon and Grace were waiting\nfor her.\n\n\"I was very sorry to hear that your mother is sick, Katy,\" said the\nformer; \"and I should have paid you a visit, instead of sending for\nyou, if I had not been so much exhausted by my journey from Baltimore.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Did Dr. Flynch call upon you at the first of the month?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; and we paid the rent as usual,\" replied Katy.\n\n\"I am sorry you did so, Katy; you should have told him you were not in\na condition to pay the rent.\"\n\n\"I couldn't tell him so, he is so cold and cruel.\"\n\n\"I think you misjudge him, for he has a really kind heart, and would\nnot have distressed you for all the world. Besides, I told him he need\nnot collect your rent any time when you did not feel ready to pay it. I\nhope he gave you no trouble?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am; I didn't give him a chance, for I paid him as soon as he\ndemanded it; though it took nearly all the money we had. I hope you\nwill excuse me, ma'am, but I haven't liked him since the trouble we had\na year ago, when he accused my dear mother of telling a lie.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he was hasty.\"\n\n\"I forgive him, ma'am; but I can't help thinking he is a very wicked\nman,\" answered Katy, with considerable emphasis.\n\n\"I hope not so bad as that; for I am sure, if you had told him it was\nnot convenient for you to pay the rent, he would not have insisted. But\nyou want some assistance Katy?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; that is, I want to borrow some money,\" replied Katy,\nblushing deeply.\n\n\"That's just like you,\" interposed Grace, laughing. \"I suppose you will\nwant to give your note this time.\"\n\n\"I don't care about giving a note, but I mean to pay the money back\nagain, every cent of it.\"\n\n\"And the interest too, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Katy, though she had not a very clear idea of the value of\nmoney, as an article of merchandise.\n\n\"Don't distress her, Grace; you forget that her mother is very sick,\nand she cannot feel like listening to your pleasantries,\" said Mrs.\nGordon.\n\n\"Forgive me, Katy,\" replied Grace, tenderly.\n\nKaty burst into tears, though she could not exactly tell why. She was\novercome with emotion as the beautiful young lady took her hand, and\nlooked so sorrowfully in her face. She was not used to so much\nkindness, so much sympathy, so much love; for it seemed as though both\nGrace and her mother loved her--that their hearts beat with hers.\n\n\"Don t cry, Katy; I am sorry I said a word,\" pleaded Grace. \"I would\nnot have hurt your feelings for all the world.\"\n\n\"You did not hurt my feelings; you are so kind to me that I could not\nhelp crying. I suppose I am very silly.\"\n\n\"No, you are not, Katy; now dry up your tears, and tell us all about\nit,\" added Mrs. Gordon, in soothing tones. \"How long has your mother\nbeen sick?\"\n\n\"Almost two weeks.\"\n\n\"What ails her?\"\n\n\"She has got a fever; but she is much better to-day. The doctor says\nshe hasn't got it very bad; but she has been very sick, I think.\"\n\n\"Who takes care of her?\"\n\n\"I do, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You! She must need a great deal of attention. But who takes care of\nher at night?\"\n\n\"I do, ma'am. I have been up a great deal every night.\"\n\n\"Poor child! It is enough to wear you out.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't mind it at all, if I had nothing else to trouble me.\"\n\n\"What other troubles have you?\"\n\n\"I can't make any candy now, and haven't made any for nearly a\nfortnight; so that we have no money coming in. We spent nearly all we\nhad in buying our winter clothing and fuel. It worries me very much,\nfor we had plenty of money before mother was taken sick.\"\n\n\"I hope you haven't wanted for anything.\"\n\n\"No, ma'am; for when my purse was empty, I came up here, only\nyesterday, to borrow some of you, if you would please to lend it me.\"\n\n\"Certainly, I will, my child. I am very glad you came.\"\n\n\"Michael would make me tell what I wanted, and then he let me have\nthree dollars, and offered to let me have as much as I wanted. I didn't\nknow as you would like it if I borrowed money of your servant.\"\n\n\"You did just right: and I am glad that Michael has a kind heart. Now,\nhow much money do you want?\"\n\n\"I thought I would ask you to lend me twenty dollars; and just as soon,\nafter mother gets well, as I can gather the money together, I will pay\nyou--and the interest,\" she added, glancing at Grace.\n\n\"Now, Katy, that is too bad!\" exclaimed Grace, catching her by the\nhand, while a tear started from her eye. \"You know I didn't mean that.\"\n\n\"I know you didn't; but I don't know much about such things, and\nthought likely it was right for us to pay interest, if we borrowed\nmoney.\"\n\n\"I should be very glad to give you twenty dollars, Katy, if you would\nonly let me; for I am rich, as well as mother, and I certainly should\nnot think of taking interest.\"\n\n\"We will say no more about that,\" interrupted Mrs. Gordon. \"I will let\nyou have the money with the greatest pleasure, for I know you will make\ngood use of it.\"\n\n\"I will, indeed.\"\n\n\"And you must promise me that you will not distress yourself to pay it\nagain,\" continued the kind lady, as she took out her purse.\n\n\"I will not distress myself, but I will pay it as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"You must not be too proud.\"\n\n\"No, ma'am; but just proud enough.\"\n\n\"Yes, that's it,\" replied Mrs. Gordon, smiling. \"Pride is a very good\nthing in its place. It keeps people from being mean and wicked\nsometimes.\"\n\n\"That's true pride,\" added Katy.\n\n\"Yes; for there is a false pride, which makes people very silly and\nvain; which keeps them from doing their duty very often. You have none\nof this kind of pride.\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"Your friend Simon Sneed, whom the mayor spoke to me about, affords us\na very good example of the folly of cherishing false pride. Where is\nSimon now?\"\n\n\"He keeps a store in Washington Street. He is a salesman now, and I\ndon't think he is so foolish as he was.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the lesson he learned did him good. But I am keeping you away\nfrom your mother, Katy. Who stays with her while you are away?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Sneed--Simon's mother.\"\n\n\"Then she is a good woman.\"\n\n\"And Simon is very kind; he has done a great many things for me, and I\nhope I shall be able to do something for him one of these days.\"\n\n\"That's right, Katy. Think well of your friends, though others speak\nill of them,\" said Grace. \"Ah, there comes the carriage. I am going\nhome with you, Katy, to see your mother.\"\n\n\"You are very kind, Miss Grace.\"\n\n\"Here is the money,\" added Mrs. Gordon, handing her a little roll of\nbills.\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am,\" replied Katy, as she placed the money in her\nporte-monnaie. \"But----\"\n\nHere she came to a full stop, and her face was as crimson as a blush\nrose, but she took out the silver watch, and approached Mrs. Gordon.\n\n\"What were you going to say, Katy?\"\n\n\"I brought this watch up,\" stammered she.\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"You know I am a poor girl, my mother is a poor woman, and we didn't\nwant you to think you were giving us the money, for we are very proud;\nthat is, my mother is very proud, and so am I; and----\"\n\nHere Katy drew a long breath, and came to a full stop again, unable to\nsay what she wanted to say.\n\n\"If you want anything else, Katy, don't hesitate to mention it; for I\nwill not do anything to mortify your pride, even if it is\nunreasonable,\" said Mrs. Gordon. \"I understand you perfectly; the\ntwenty dollars is not a gift, but a loan.\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; but if we should never be able to pay it, then it would be\na gift.\"\n\n\"No, it wouldn't.\"\n\n\"I think so; and so I brought this watch, which you will please to take\nas security for the payment of the loan,\" said Katy, much confused, as\nshe offered the watch to Mrs. Gordon.\n\n\"My dear child, I do not want any security. Your word is just as good\nas your bond.\"\n\n\"But I would rather you would take it. My mother is prouder than I am,\nfor she wasn't always as poor as she is now.\"\n\nKaty suddenly clapped her hand over her mouth, when she recollected\nthat this was a forbidden topic.\n\n\"Some time you may tell me all about your mother; and I will call and\nsee her to-morrow, and help you take care of her.\"\n\n\"Please to take the watch, ma'am.\"\n\n\"If you very much desire it, I shall do so, though I cannot take it as\nsecurity. Is this the watch you carried to the pawnbroker?\" said Mrs.\nGordon as she took the treasure.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. It belonged to my father.\"\n\nMrs. Gordon turned over the watch, and looked at it with considerable\ninterest, as she thought of it as a memento of the dead, and how highly\nit must be prized by the poor woman.\n\n\"Mercy, what's this!\" exclaimed she, starting back, and staggering\ntowards her chair.\n\n\"What is the matter, mother?\" cried Grace, running to her side. \"Are\nyou ill?\"\n\n\"No, Grace; that inscription!\" replied Mrs. Gordon, faintly, for she\nseemed very deeply moved, and on the point of swooning. \"Bring me a\nglass of water.\"\n\nThere was no water in the room, but Michael was in the entry, and was\ndispatched to procure it. He returned in a moment, and when Mrs. Gordon\nhad in some measure recovered from the sudden shock she pointed to the\ninscription on the back of the watch:--\n\n                  \"M. G.\n                    to\n                   J. R.\n              All for the Best.\"\n\n\n\"What does, it mean, mother? I do not see anything very strange about\nthat.\"\n\n\"I have seen this watch before,\" she replied, stopping to think. \"Where\ndid your mother get this watch, Katy?\" she asked, as it occurred to her\nthat she might be arriving at a conclusion too suddenly.\n\n\"It was my father's.\"\n\n\"Where did your father get it? Did you ever hear your mother say?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; her father, who was a rich Liverpool merchant, gave it to\nher husband, my father,\" replied Katy, who felt justified in revealing\nwhat her mother had told her to keep secret.\n\n\"Mercy!\" gasped Mrs. Gordon, almost overcome by her emotions.\n\n\"What is the matter, mother? What has all this to do with you?\" asked\nGrace, anxiously.\n\n\"Come here, Katy, my child,\" continued Mrs. Gordon, as she drew the\nlittle candy merchant to her side, and warmly embraced her. \"Your\nmother, Katy, is my sister, I have scarcely a doubt.\"\n\n\"Why, mother! Is it possible?\" exclaimed Grace.\n\n\"It is even so. Mrs. Redburn, whose name we have often heard mentioned\nwithout thinking it might be the wife of John Redburn, my father's\nclerk, is my sister. I had given her up, and have regarded her as dead\nfor more than ten years. But, Grace, get my things, and I will go to\nher at once.\"\n\n\"Is that your portrait, ma'am?\" asked Katy, pointing to the picture of\nthe mischievous lady.\n\n\"No, child; that is your mother's portrait.\"\n\n\"I almost knew it.\"\n\n\"It was taken when she was only sixteen years old. She was a gay, wild\ngirl then. I suppose she is sadly changed now.\"\n\nThe thought completely overcame Mrs. Gordon, and throwing herself upon\na sofa, she wept like a child. She thought of her sister suffering from\npoverty and want, while she had been rolling in opulence and plenty.\nGrace tried to comfort her, but it was some time  before she was in a\ncondition to enter the carriage which was waiting at the door.\n\n\"What an adventure, mother!\" exclaimed Grace, as she seated herself by\nthe side of Katy; and it was evident she had a vein of the romantic in\nher composition.\n\n\"Do not talk to me, Grace. My heart is too full for words.\"\n\n\"But I may talk to Katy--may I not?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, cousin Katy,\" laughed Grace; \"I shall call you cousin, though\nyou are not really my cousin.\"\n\n\"Not your cousin?\" said Katy, a shade of disappointment crossing her\nanimated features.\n\n\"No; for Mrs. Gordon is not really my mother; only my stepmother; but\nshe is just as good as a real mother, for I never knew any other. Dear\nme! how strange all this is! And you will go up and live with us in\nTemple Street, and----\"\n\n\"I can't leave my mother,\" interrupted Katy.\n\n\"You mother shall go, too.\"\n\n\"She is too sick now.\"\n\nGrace continued to talk as fast as she could, laying out ever so many\nplans for the future, till the carriage reached Colvin Court. I will\nnot follow them into the chamber of the sick woman; where Mrs. Gordon,\nby a slow process that did not agitate the invalid too violently,\nrevealed herself to her sister. The fine lady of Temple Street had a\nheart, a warm and true heart, and not that day, nor that night, nor for\na week, did she leave the sick bed of the sufferer. There, in the midst\nof her sister's poverty, she did a sister's offices.\n\nIt was three weeks before Mrs. Redburn was in a condition to be moved\nto her sister's house; and then she was once more in the midst of the\nluxury and splendor of her early life. One day, when she had improved\nso much as to be able to bear the fatigue of a long conversation, Mrs.\nGordon, who had thus far declined to discuss any exciting topics with\nthe invalid proposed to have everything explained. Each had a very long\nstory to tell; but as the reader already knows Mrs. Redburn's history,\nI shall only briefly narrate that of Mrs. Gordon and the Guthrie\nfamily, after the departure of the former.\n\nMr. Guthrie, the father of both, died two years after the flight of\nMargaret--Mrs. Redburn--when of course there was a large property to be\ndivided. Diligent search was made for Margaret in America but her\nhusband had declared to some person in Liverpool that he had an\nengagement in Montreal. This place was thoroughly canvassed, but\nwithout success. No trace of the runaways could be discovered. Agents\nwere sent to various parts of America, and no tidings of Margaret had\never reached them.\n\nAbout two year after her father's death, Jane--Mrs. Gordon--had married\na very wealthy gentleman from Baltimore. He was then a widower with one\nchild--Grace Gordon. She had come to America with him, and resided in\nBaltimore till his death, a period of only two years. Then, having\nnever liked to live in that city, she had removed to Boston, where she\nhad a few friends. She had invested her money and resided there, very\nhappily situated, and with no desire to return to her native land.\n\nHer father's estate had been divided, and the portion which belonged to\nMargaret was held in trust for seven years--when the law presumed she\nwas dead--and was then delivered to her sister, who was the only\nremaining heir. Now that she had appeared, it was promptly paid over to\nher, and Mrs. Redburn, before poor and proud, was now rich, and\nhumility never sat more gracefully on the brow of woman than on hers.\n\nKaty and her mother had entered upon a new life, and in the midst of\nluxury and splendor, they could not forget the past nor cease to thank\nGod for His past and present mercies. Mrs. Gordon used to declare it\nwas strange she had never thought that Mrs. Redburn might be her\nsister; but it was declared that stranger things than that had happened.\n\nKaty continued to go to school with great regularity, and became an\nexcellent scholar. She was beloved by all her companions and Grace, who\nwas married shortly after Katy entered the family, always regarded her\nwith the affection of a sister, insisting that she should spend half\nthe time at her house. Mrs. Redburn was soon completely restored to\nhealth. She had a fortune to manage now, and when Dr. Flynch proposed\nto collect her rents and take charge of her affairs, she respectfully\ndeclined the offer. Mrs. Gordon did not like him as well as formerly,\nfor her sister had opened her eyes in regard to his true character, and\nshe soon found an opportunity to discharge him.\n\nHaving carried Katy through her principal troubles and chronicled the\nrise and fall of the candy trade we shall step forward ten years to\ntake a final look at her and her friends, and then bid them farewell.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nKATY GOES TO CHURCH, AND HAS A BIRTHDAY PARTY.\n\nTen years is a long time--long enough to change the child into a woman,\nthe little candy merchant into a fine lady. I suppose, therefore, that\nmy young friends will need to be introduced to Miss Redburn. There she\nsits in the pleasant apartment in Temple Street, where the picture of\nthe mischievous girl still hangs, though it looks very little like the\nmatron at her side, for whom it was taken. She is not beautiful enough\nto be the heroine of a romance, neither has she done any absurd thing;\nshe has only supported her mother when she had no one else to care for\nher. But Katy is irresistible if she is not pretty. She still looks as\npleasant as a morning in June, and smiles sweetly when any one speaks\nto her and when she speaks to any one.\n\nI am sorry I cannot inform my young lady friends how Miss Redburn was\ndressed, or how she proposed to dress, at her birthday party, which was\nto come off the following week--what silks, what laces what muslins,\nand what jewels she was to wear. I can only say that she was dressed\nvery plainly, and that her garments were exceedingly becoming; and that\nshe had steadily resisted the solicitations of sundry French milliners\nand dressmakers to exceed her usual simplicity at the party--and I\ncordially command her example to all young ladies.\n\nWhile Miss Redburn sat at the window, the doorbell rang with great\nviolence; and Michael--yes, Michael--he is still there, a veteran in\nthe service of Mrs. Gordon, and fully believing that Katy is an\nangel--Michael hastened to admit Grace. She is a little older than when\nwe saw her last, but she is the same Grace. She enters the room, kisses\nKaty with as much zeal as though she had not seen her for months,\nthough they had met the day before. She had scarcely saluted her cousin\nbefore a little fat man of six came tumbling into the room, for he had\nnot been able to keep up with his mother.\n\n\"Come, aunty,\" said little Tommy, who persisted in calling her by this\ntitle, as he rolled up to Miss Redburn, who gave him a hearty\nkiss--\"come, aunty, I want you to come right down into the kitchen, and\nmake me a lot of molatheth candy.\"\n\n\"Not now, Tommy\"--would you believe it, reader? that little boy's name\nis Thomas Howard Parker--\"not now, Tommy. I came to tell you, Katy,\nthat the King of the Billows has been telegraphed.\"\n\n\"Has she?\" exclaimed Katy, a deep blush suffusing her cheek.\n\n\"Yes; and you must go right down to the wharf, or we shall not be in\nseason to see Captain Howard, who is coming up in a pilot boat.\"\n\nMiss Redburn hastened to put on her things, and she and Mrs. Parker\nseated themselves in the carriage that waited them.\n\nOf course, you know Captain Howard, reader? He has followed the sea\nonly eleven years; and though but twenty-five years old, he is the\ncommander of a fine clipper, and sails in the Liverpool line. He is\nfrequently quoted as an example of what patient perseverance will\naccomplish; for, with very little aid from friends, he has worked his\nway from the forecastle into the cabin. He is a self-educated man, and\nhas the reputation of being a thorough sailor and a perfect gentleman.\n\nPursuant to a little arrangement made between Captain Howard and Miss\nRedburn, just as he departed on this voyage, they were both seen in\nchurch on the following Thursday afternoon; and when they came out,\npeople addressed Katy as Mrs. Howard. But to pass on to the occasions\nwhich she had chosen to call a birthday party, though it was not\nexactly that; and as it came immediately after the church service, some\ncalled it a levee.\n\nThere are a great many persons in the Gordon mansion, as many as two\nhundred, I should think. Of course, I cannot stop to introduce all of\nthem, but there are a few who deserve this favor.\n\n\"Mr. Sneed, I am delighted to see you,\" said Mrs. Howard, as a very\ntall and very slim gentleman, elegantly dressed, approached.\n\n\"You do me honor, madam. It is the superlative felicity of my sublunary\nexistence to congratulate you on this auspicious occasion,\" replied Mr.\nSneed, as he gently pressed the gloved hand of the lady.\n\nThat sounds just like Master Simon Sneed, only very much intensified.\nSimon is a salesman still in a large establishment--has never risen\nabove that position and probably never will; for, born to be a\ngentleman, he feels as much above his business as his business really\nis above him.\n\nSimon's father and mother say a pleasant word to the bride, and pass\non. And here comes a great fat woman, whose tongue flies like the\nshuttle in a loom. Well, it is the captain's mother. Since her son has\nbeen prosperous, she has had an easy time of it, and has grown very\ncorpulent.\n\n\"Who do you think has come, Katy?\" puffed Mrs. Howard.\n\n\"I don't know. Who?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Colvin, that was! Mrs. McCarty, that is.\"\n\nSome of the very good-natured people laughed, and some of the very\nfastidious ones turned up their noses, when they saw Mrs. McCarty so\nwarmly received by the bride; but she did not care who laughed or who\nsneered; she was not too proud to welcome, in the hour of prosperity\nand happiness, those who had been her friends in adversity.\n\n\"Mrs. Howard, I congratulate you,\" said a fat man, who was puffing and\nblowing at the heat of the room.\n\nIt was an ex-mayor and after he had said a few pleasant words, he\npassed on to make room for a hundred more who were waiting to speak to\nthe bride.\n\nThat was a very pleasant party; but as we are opposed to crowded rooms\nand late hours, we may as well retire.\n\nThe next day the happy couple started upon a bridal tour, and on their\nreturn, Captain Howard sailed for Liverpool, in his fine ship, with\nMrs. Howard as a passenger.\n\nAnd now my young friend, adieu. If you are poor, don't be too proud to\nwork at any honest occupation; but be too proud to do wrong--too proud\nto degrade yourself in your own eyes, by doing a mean act; and in this\nsense you may truly be \"Poor and Proud.\"",
